Abstract
Background: Helicobacter canadensis is an emerging human pathogen and zoonotic agent. The genome of H.
canadensis was sequenced previously and determined to contain 29 annotated coding regions associated with
homopolymeric tracts.
Results: Twenty-one of the repeat-associated coding regions were determined to be potentially transcriptionally or
translationally phase variable. In each case the homopolymeric tract was within the predicted promoter region or
at the 5’ end of the coding region, respectively. However, eight coding sequences were identified with simple
sequence repeats toward the 3’ end of the open reading frame. In these cases, the repeat tract would be too far
into the coding region to be mediating translational phase variation. All of the 29 coding region-associated
homopolymeric tracts display variability in tract length in the sequencing read data.
Conclusions: Twenty-nine coding regions have been identified in the genome sequence of Helicobacter
canadensis strain NCTC13241 that show variations in homopolymeric tract length in the bacterial population,
indicative of phase variation. Five of these are potentially associated with promoter regions, which would lead to
transcriptional phase variation. Translational phase variation usually switches expression of a gene ON and OFF due
to the repeat region being located sufficiently close to the initiation codon for the resulting frame-shift to lead to a
premature termination codon and stop the translation of the protein. Sixteen of the 29 coding regions have
homopolymeric tracts characteristic of translational phase variation. For eight coding sequences with repeats
located later in the reading frame, changes in the repeat tract length would alter the protein sequence at the Cterminus but not stop the expression of the protein. This mechanism of C-terminal phase variation has implications
for stochastic switching of protein sequence in bacterial species that already undergo transcriptional and
translational phase variation.

Background
The gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori was the first
identified Helicobacter species, was first cultured in
1984, and is associated with peptic ulcers, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas, chronic active gastritis, chronic atrophic gastritis and subsequent
carcinomas, persistent diarrhoea, and increased susceptibility to other diseases [1-3]. Since 1984, over 20 further
Helicobacter species have been identified, many of which

have been implicated as animal pathogens, but in general these remain poorly characterised.
4To date, three H. pylori genome sequences have been
published, one each isolated from cases of gastritis [4],
duodenal ulcer [5], and chronic atrophic gastritis [6]. Five
additional genome sequences, not yet completed and published, are from three cases of gastric carcinoma, one from
gastric ulcer, and one from a remote Amazonian village.
But humans are not the only species plagued by gut problems associated with these bacteria; Helicobacter acinonychis, the genome sequence of which was published in 2006
[7], is believed to contribute to the severe gastritis experienced by cheetahs and other big cats that can lead to

premature death of these felines in captivity [8,9]. At the
other end of the mammalian spectrum, mice colonies with
increased incidence of liver tumours were found to be
colonized with Helicobacter hepaticus [10,11], for which
strain ATCC 51449 has been genome sequenced [11]. In
addition, the Helicobacteraceae includes Wolinella succinogenes, a non-pathogen that can be isolated from the
rumen of cattle [12] and considered to be phylogenetically
an intermediate between Helicobacter and Campylobacter
[13]. A genome sequence is available for W. succinogenes
strain DSM1740 [14].
Some isolates which might have previously been taken
for known Helicobacter spp. or Campylobacter spp. are
instead novel Helicobacter species [15]. Helicobacter
pullorum has been repeatedly isolated from chickens
and detected in chicken faeces by molecular methods
[16-21]. This species is also found in humans
[18,20,22-25], where it is associated with gastroenteritis,
liver disease, diarrhoea, and gall bladder disease
[20,24-26]. H. pullorum differs from most other Helicobacter spp. in that it lacks a flagellar sheath and is
unable to hydrolyze indoxyl acetate [20]. It is this later
phenotype that eventually revealed that some of the isolates being classified as H. pullorum were actually a
novel species, Helicobacter canadensis [18,20,24] which
is indoxyl acetate positive [24]. Labelled an emerging
pathogen as a zoonotic agent [27], H. canadensis has
been isolated from geese [27], rodent faeces [28], swine
[29], and humans, where it has been associated with
diarrhoea and bacteraemia [30,31].
During the annotation of the complete genome
sequence of H. canadensis strain NCTC13241 [32], simple
sequence repeats were sought and a repertoire of 29
homopolymeric tract-associated coding regions was identified. Five candidates for transcriptional phase variation and
16 candidates for translational phase variation were identified. The remaining eight annotated coding sequences
were identified with long poly-G tracts (≥ 10 bp) toward
the end of the annotated coding region. These represent a
novel mechanism for phase variation in which stochastic
switching of simple sequence repeat tract lengths mediates
changes in expressed protein sequence. This is distinct
from transcriptional phase variation, in which the distance
and facing of promoter elements are altered, and from
translational phase variation, in which frame-shifts resulting from repeat tract length changes lead to premature
termination. We propose that this C-terminal phase variation may also be found in other species employing transcriptional and translational phase variation.

Results and Discussion
Search for phase variable genes

Given the presence of an extensive repertoire of phase
variable genes in other Helicobacter spp. [4,5,11,33,34],

Page 2 of 8

simple sequence repeats were sought in the H. canadensis strain NCTC13241 genome sequence data. If repeats
were discovered to be within the context of a predicted
coding region or predicted promoter such that they had
the potential to mediate phase variation, then that feature was annotated as potentially phase variable (Table
1).
Based on previous investigations [33-35], searches
were made of the genome sequence data for homopolymeric tracts greater than or equal to (G)7, (C)7, (A)9,
and (T)9 and for dinucleotide repeat tracts with five or
more copies of the dinucleotide. No potential dinucleotide-mediated phase variable CDSs were identified in
the H. canadensis genome sequence data. For all homopolymeric tracts the context of the repeat, tract length,
and presence of a frame-shift were assessed to determine that the H. canadensis genome sequence contains
21 potential phase variable genes (Table 1). Of these, six
are strong candidates, eight are good candidates, and
two are putative candidates for translational phase variation, while five are possibly promoter-associated, mediating transcriptional phase variation. Strong candidates
contained frame-shift mutations or long tract lengths
(>9), or both. Good candidates contained long tracts in
the appropriate position to mediate translational switching. One of the putative candidates (HCAN_0659) contained a shorter (G)9 tract length and no frame-shift,
while the other (HCAN_0344) would be considered a
strong candidate if an alternative initiation codon 5’ of
the repeat were chosen rather than that annotated.
It is interesting to note that in all cases the translational phase variation is mediated by poly-G tracts,
whereas candidates with poly-C, -A, -T, -GA, -CT, -TC,
-AT, and -AG tracts have been reported in other Helicobacter spp. [4,5,11,33,34]. The sole occurrence of a polyA tract potentially involved in phase variation in this H.
canadensis is in the putative promoter region of
HCAN_0162, a conserved hypothetical gene.
C-terminal phase variation

In addition to the potentially phase variable genes identified, eight CDSs were found to contain homopolymeric
tracts at the 3’ end (Table 2) of the reading frame. In
this location these could not be mediating phase variable
expression of the CDS as most of the mRNA would be
translated before reaching the late homopolymeric tract
and subsequent termination codon. In most cases, an
alteration in the reading frame at that point would
change the length of the encoded protein by only a few
amino acids (Table 2).
It is interesting to note that, like the transcriptional
and translational phase variable CDSs, all of these Cterminal variation CDSs contain poly-G tracts and all
are (G)10 or more (Table 2). Given the strength in polyG tracts in the transcriptionally and translationally

phase variable genes (Table 1) and the length of these
tracts (Table 2), this data supports a role for the
instability of these tracts at the end of the gene, as well
as at the beginning and within the promoter.
One of these, flaG (HCAN_0914) contains a (G)11
tract five bases before the termination codon and alteration of the tract length would lead to slight changes in
the length of the encoded protein. As annotated, there
are two amino acids before the termination codon. In

the other two frames there would be 16 amino acids or
no amino acids before the termination codons in those
frames (Table 2). FlaG has been shown to affect flagellar
length and adherence to Hep-2 cells in Aeromonas [36].
Thus it is intriguing that changes in the length of this
homopolymeric tract would alter the C-terminus of this
protein.

CDS, HCAN_0661 encoding 82 amino acids. Although
both CDSs are currently hypothetical, such an arrangement suggests that the protein sequences may have
roles that can alternatively be filled as individual proteins or jointly as one protein. This finding, that a phase
variation event can determine whether two proteins are
made separately or are translated as one protein, is perhaps unprecedented. It may be that degeneration events
have disrupted similar fusions in this or other bacterial
species, which are not now apparent from sequence
data.
Population-level variation within homopolymeric tracts

Previous studies into phase variable genes of the Helicobacter spp. have indicated that phase variable switching
of a gene can be demonstrated at the population level
through DNA sequencing. It has been shown that variations in the lengths of homopolymeric tracts are attributable to variations in the DNA template population and
are not an artefact of the sequencing process, although
this may be influenced by the length of repeat and the
experimental conditions [33].
When the read data from the genome sequencing
was analyzed for variations in homopolymeric tract
length, it was found that all of the repeats investigated
showed some degree of variation (Tables 1 &2). While
it is known that homopolymeric tracts can be problematic for this sequencing technology (454, Roche), the
results are consistent with the level of variation that
would be expected at the population level. Phase variable bacteria are known to have dynamically changing
populations undergoing phase variation events that
lead to intra-population diversity and, in some cases,
visible differences on culture plates, including colony
sectoring [37]. Variation in repeat lengths at the
sequence level should therefore be expected. In each
case the range of the repeat lengths observed here is
indicated in Tables 1 &2 and the alignments of the
read data is available in Additional files 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22,
23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 and 29).
This level of variation is suggestive evidence of phase
variation of these coding regions, indicating that each
of these coding regions warrants further study. This
evidence is particularly important for those that are
putative candidates (Table 1) and those that contain
C-terminal repeats (Table 2). In all of the translational
phase variation candidates the repeat lengths would
correspond to both ON and OFF states of full-length
gene expression. The highest degree of variability is
seen in HCAN_0457, encoding the vacuolating cytotoxin precursor, with 12 to 20 copies of the poly-G
repeat.

Potential structural consequences of C-terminal phase
variation

Each of the eight CDSs identified as containing a homopolymeric tract at the C-terminal end of the reading
frame were translated and compared against the NCBI
Conserved Domain Database (CDD). In each case where
structural data was available, the Cn3D model was
assessed to determine what the potential structural consequences would be of alterations in the length and
sequence of the C-terminus.
The C-terminal structures available for proteins which
share similarity with HCAN_0165 (rfbB) all have an ahelix at the C-terminus. This is potentially eliminated in
the shorter forms of this CDS in frames 1 and 2,
mediated by a poly-G tract.
The structures of proteins with similar conserved
domains to HCAN_0641 and HCAN_0914 suggest that
changes in the length of this CDS would alter the Cterminal b-sheet. HCAN_0914 is flaG, therefore this
potential change in b-sheet structure may have an effect
on the H. canadensis flagella.
Changes in the poly-G repeat within HCAN_0643
would not alter the length of this protein, however
changes would alter the sequence. In this case, the
structure of CDD similar protein Fmt suggests that this
would be within a largely unstructured C-terminus.
For the remaining four CDSs, there were either no
CDD hits (HCAN_0653) or none that were full-length
(HCAN_0660, HCAN_0665, and HCAN_1332).
Distribution of phase variable genes

When the H. canadensis strain NCTC13241 genome
sequence was investigated to identify novel CDSs not
found in other Helicobacter genome sequences, only one
example of a contiguous cluster longer than 5 genes was
found (HCAN_0630 to HCAN_0663). This region is notable for possessing three copies of asnB, encoding asparagine synthetase (HCAN_0654, HCAN_0657, and
HCAN_0662). A fourth copy of asnB (HCAN_0730) is 69
kb outside this cluster adjacent to one of the two STT3
domain-containing PglB copies (HCAN_0729 and
HCAN_0930) [32]. Most of the other coding sequences in
the region are of unknown function, lacking significant
matches in GenBank. Notably, a high frequency of potentially phase variation-mediating homopolymeric tracts
were detected in and around this region, with eight out of
21 identified candidate phase variable genes (Table 1) and
five out of eight C-terminal variable genes (Table 2) being
within or near this cluster. These encode a putative oxidoreductase (HCAN_0632), a 3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] reductase (HCAN_0641), a methionyl-tRNA
formyltransferase (HCAN_0643), two putatitive methyltransferases (HCAN_0647 and HCAN_0671), a 2-polyprenyl-3-methyl-5-hydroxy-6-metoxy-1,4- benzoquinol
methylase (HCAN_0659), three conserved hypothetical

Snyder et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:67

proteins (HCAN_0648, HCAN_0651, and HCAN0665),
and four hypothetical proteins (HCAN_0653,
HCAN_0655, HCAN0660, and HCAN_0670). This cluster
of repeat tracts within the CDSs may suggest that this
region of the chromosome is a particular hot-spot for the
presence of phase variable tracts. This may have functional
consequences for the interaction of these gene products or
their regulatory controls.
The genome of H. canadensis NCTC13241 contains a
capsular polysaccharide export locus (HCAN_0144 to
HCAN_0149, HCAN_0150) encoding orthologues of
KpsS, KpsD, KpsE, KpsT, KpsM, and KpsC from C.
jejuni. This is the first evidence of a polysaccharide capsule in the Helicobacter spp. and, like in C. jejuni, this
was only revealed once the genome had been sequenced.
The presence of an annotated sialyltransferase just outside of this locus (HCAN_0152, siaD) suggests capsule
sialylation, which is known to be an important virulence
factor in Neisseria meningitidis [38] and group B Streptococcus [39]. In C. jejuni, however, only LOS has been
shown to be sialylated [40]. Two strong, frame-shifted
candidates for translational phase variation
(HCAN_0151 and HCAN_0153) flank this sialyltransferase CDS, encoding a hypothetical protein and a polysaccharide deacetylase family protein, respectively.

Conclusion
H. canadensis strain NCTC13241 contains five candidate
transcriptional phase variable CDSs, 16 candidate translational phase variable CDSs, and eight candidate C-terminal
phase variable CDSs. In all cases the read data is indicative
of repeat tract length variation in the bacterial population
pool collected for DNA extraction and sequencing. A previous study of bacterial genome sequences has suggested
that due to their instability, repeat tracts are selected
against in coding sequences. When they are present, there
is a demonstrated bias toward homopolymeric tracts
within the first one-fifth of the coding region [41], the
location expected for translational phase variation. This
data also shows that there are a higher proportion of
homopolymeric tracts in the final one-fifth of the coding
region than in the internal three-fifths, which may support
C-terminal variation in other bacterial species [41]. Alternations of the tract length in the candidate C-terminal
phase variable H. canadensis CDSs would result in differences in the C-terminus of the encoded proteins, which
may impact the function, specificity, and/or antigenicity of
the products. Similarly placed repeats have been identified
in the Neisseria spp. (Snyder, previously unreported personal observation), which extensively utilizes phase variation
for transcriptional and translational expression switching.
Indeed, the potential for 3’ repeats to generate gene
fusions, as seen here between HCAN_0660 and
HCAN_0661, has been previously speculated [41]. Such

Page 5 of 8

genes containing stochastic switches late in the coding
region warrant further investigation in the laboratory. In
addition, the genome sequence data from other species
that employ phase variation should be re-investigated in
light of this finding in H. canadensis.

Methods
Using the DNA sequence search facility within the
GenDB annotation software [42], simple sequence
repeats greater than or equal to (G)7, (C)7, (A)9, and
(T)9 were identified. In addition, dinucleotide repeats
greater than or equal to four copies were found. Tandem repeats in the genome sequence data were identified using Tandem Repeats Finder [43]. The context of
identified repeats was investigated within GenDB and
associated CDSs were annotated as described previously
[32]. The NCBI BLASTP search was used to access the
Conserved Domain Database and associated links to
Cn3D structural data files, which were visualized using
Cn3D version 4.1 available from the NCBI.
