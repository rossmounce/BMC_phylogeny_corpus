Abstract
Background: Gut microbiota contribute to the health of their hosts, and alterations in the composition of this
microbiota can lead to disease. Previously, we demonstrated that indigenous gut bacteria were required for the
insecticidal toxin of Bacillus thuringiensis to kill the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar. B. thuringiensis and its associated
insecticidal toxins are commonly used for the control of lepidopteran pests. A variety of factors associated with
the insect host, B. thuringiensis strain, and environment affect the wide range of susceptibilities among Lepidoptera,
but the interaction of gut bacteria with these factors is not understood. To assess the contribution of gut bacteria
to B. thuringiensis susceptibility across a range of Lepidoptera we examined larval mortality of six species in the
presence and absence of their indigenous gut bacteria. We then assessed the effect of feeding an enteric bacterium
isolated from L. dispar on larval mortality following ingestion of B. thuringiensis toxin.
Results: Oral administration of antibiotics reduced larval mortality due to B. thuringiensis in five of six species
tested. These included Vanessa cardui (L.), Manduca sexta (L.), Pieris rapae (L.) and Heliothis virescens (F.) treated
with a formulation composed of B. thuringiensis cells and toxins (DiPel), and Lymantria dispar (L.) treated with a
cell-free formulation of B. thuringiensis toxin (MVPII). Antibiotics eliminated populations of gut bacteria below
detectable levels in each of the insects, with the exception of H. virescens, which did not have detectable gut
bacteria prior to treatment. Oral administration of the Gram-negative Enterobacter sp. NAB3, an indigenous gut
resident of L. dispar, restored larval mortality in all four of the species in which antibiotics both reduced
susceptibility to B. thuringiensis and eliminated gut bacteria, but not in H. virescens. In contrast, ingestion of B.
thuringiensis toxin (MVPII) following antibiotic treatment significantly increased mortality of Pectinophora gossypiella
(Saunders), which was also the only species with detectable gut bacteria that lacked a Gram-negative component.
Further, mortality of P. gossypiella larvae reared on diet amended with B. thuringiensis toxin and Enterobacter sp.
NAB3 was generally faster than with B. thuringiensis toxin alone.
Conclusion: This study demonstrates that in some larval species, indigenous gut bacteria contribute to B.
thuringiensis susceptibility. Moreover, the contribution of enteric bacteria to host mortality suggests that
perturbations caused by toxin feeding induce otherwise benign gut bacteria to exert pathogenic effects. The
interaction between B. thuringiensis and the gut microbiota of Lepidoptera may provide a useful model with which
to identify the factors involved in such transitions.

Background
Since the independent discovery of Bacillus thuringiensis in
two lepidopteran species, Bombyx mori (L.) and Ephestia
kuehniella (Zeller), at the beginning of the 20th century
[1,2], Lepidoptera have served as the leading insect model
for elucidating the mode of action and specificity of B.
thuringiensis and its associated insecticidal toxins. A variety of lepidopteran whole-animal models, as well as cell
lines and membrane preparations derived from Lepidoptera, have been used to identify factors that enhance or
inhibit B. thuringiensis activity and define the cellular and
molecular responses to B. thuringiensis toxin. In particular,
the use of lepidopteran cell culture and brush border
membrane vesicle preparations to dissect the complex
interactions between toxin and midgut receptors have
generated a substantive understanding of the mechanisms
of pore formation and defined the processes that lead to
disruption of larval gut integrity [3-5]. In combination
with studies on resistant insects, studies in these models
have also identified the specific midgut receptors involved
in toxin binding, including cadherin-like proteins, aminopeptidases, and additional GPI-anchored proteins such
as alkaline phosphatase [6-11]. These studies have also
demonstrated that susceptibility to B. thuringiensis varies
among different species of Lepidoptera, in the amount of
toxin required to cause mortality, the speed of mortality,
and the response to toxin following ingestion [12,13].
Beginning with their original characterization, Heimpel
and Angus described B. thuringiensis as exhibiting variable
modes of action, and thus categorized lepidopteran host
species into three groups [14]. Type I species exhibit a general paralysis following ingestion of toxin and rapid death
within hours. Type II species, which include the majority
of Lepidoptera, are characterized by a cessation of feeding
following toxin ingestion, a paralysis restricted to the gut,
and death within 2 to 4 days. Type III insects require both
spore and toxin for mortality by B. thuringiensis. Subsequent analyses demonstrated additional complexity in
host responses, as factors such as toxin concentration and
larval age can result in variable modes of action even
within the same insect species (for example, toxic action
at high doses, septicemia at low doses) [15-17]. In addition, certain physiological and genetic features of lepidopteran hosts are known to contribute to differences in
susceptibility to B. thuringiensis. For example, host factors
such as midgut pH and proteases contribute to the solubilization and activation of toxin following ingestion.
The beneficial contributions of gut microbiota to host
health are generally acknowledged [18-21]. However,
they can also have negative impacts, as perturbations in
the composition or location of gut microbiota can lead to
pathological states and host mortality [22-26]. Previously,
we demonstrated that the elimination of indigenous

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/11

enteric bacteria from gypsy moth larvae, Lymantria dispar
(L.), achieved by rearing them on antibiotics, greatly
reduced susceptibility to a formulation of B. thuringiensis
(DiPel) composed of cells, spores, and toxins (Cry1Aa,
Cry1Ab, Cry1Ac, and Cry2A) [27]. Additionally, re-establishment of a single enteric species, Enterobacter sp. NAB3,
restored B. thuringiensis susceptibility. To account for a
potential direct impact of antibiotics on the B. thuringiensis bacterium, we used an Escherichia coli strain engineered
to produce the B. thuringiensis Cry1Aa toxin gene. Ingestion of an overnight culture containing live, but not heatkilled, E. coli Cry1Aa-producing cells also restored susceptibility of larvae reared on antibiotics to B. thuringiensis.
Additionally, prior rearing on antibiotics did not inhibit
establishment of Enterobacter sp. NAB3 when fed to larvae
after cessation of antibiotic feeding, even though this
strain is sensitive to the antibiotics incorporated into artificial diet [28], suggesting that direct effects of antibiotics
on B. thuringiensis cells during the feedback are also
unlikely. This interpretation is supported by our direct
measurements (not reported) of an average of 2 × 102
CFU/gut of B. thuringiensis from larvae fed antibiotics,
compared with 1.6 × 102 CFU/gut in larvae reared without
antibiotics. Based on this evidence and our distinction
between how B. thuringiensis was unable to grow in the
hemolymph of living larvae even though it can grow rapidly in dead or moribund larvae [12,27,29-35], we proposed a model in which toxin disruption of the midgut
leads to septicemia by enteric bacteria resulting in both
larval death and more favorable conditions for B. thuringiensis germination and growth. The broader applicability
of this model to additional lepidopteran species was
unknown.
To determine whether enteric bacteria were necessary for
susceptibility to B. thuringiensis in other Lepidoptera, we
compared larval mortality to B. thuringiensis in the presence and absence of their indigenous gut bacteria among
a range of species from five additional families. These
included: Manduca sexta (L.) (Sphingidae), Vanessa cardui
(L.) (Nymphalidae), Pieris rapae (L.) (Pieridae), Heliothis
virescens (F.) (Noctuidae), and Pectinophora gossypiella
(Saunders) (Gelechiidae). We also used a cell-free formulation of B. thuringiensis, MVPII, in assays with L. dispar to
extend our work with the DiPel cell-based formulation.
The MVPII formulation consists of Cry1Ac protoxin
encapsulated in NaCl-killed Pseudomonas fluorescens cells.
MVPII was also used in assays with Pectinophora gossypiella,
as it is the most commonly used B. thuringiensis formulation with this species [36]. We then assessed the ability of
a single enteric bacterium from L. dispar, Enterobacter sp.
NAB3, to restore B. thuringiensis-induced killing in those
species in which antibiotics reduced mortality. Additionally, we characterized the enteric bacteria associated with

larvae of each species and determined the effects of our
antibiotic treatments on these communities.

Results
Diversity of gut bacteria and effects of antibiotic
treatments among test Lepidoptera
Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences
obtained from clone libraries from the midguts of V. cardui, M. sexta, P. rapae, and P. gossypiella larvae indicated
relatively narrow taxonomic diversity of gut bacteria
(Table 1). Collectively, all 16S rRNA gene sequences affiliated with either Gram-positive Firmicutes, representing
only two species (Lactococcus lactis and Enterococcus casseliflavus) or Gram-negative bacteria within the γ-Proteobacteria subphylum. Amongst the γ-Proteobacteria, all 16S
rRNA gene sequences affiliated with the family Enterobacteriaceae except for one, which was affiliated with Pseudomonas putida (Pseudomonadaceae). In addition, the
compositions of the gut communities of these Lepidoptera were relatively simple, generally consisting of two
bacterial phylotypes, one of which was an Enterobacteriaceae, except in the case of P. gossypiella, which was singularly associated with the Gram-positive bacterium E.
casseliflavus. No gut bacteria were identified in H. virescens
guts either by culturing or direct 16S rRNA gene analysis.
Rearing larvae on antibiotics reduced gut bacteria to
below detectable levels in all five Lepidoptera species in
which they were previously detectable (Table 1).
Effect of antibiotics on susceptibility of Lepidoptera to B.
thuringiensis
Administration of B. thuringiensis without antibiotics was
lethal to all six species, and antibiotics significantly
reduced mortality in five of them (M. sexta, V. cardui, P.
rapae, L. dispar and H. virescens) (Figure 1). Mean larval
mortality of V. cardui, M. sexta, P. rapae, and H. virsescens
reared without antibiotics and fed B. thuringiensis cells,
spores, and toxin (DiPel) ranged from 63 to 100%. The
same concentration of B. thuringiensis caused only 0 to

10% mortality in V. cardui, M. sexta, P. rapae, and H. virsescens when larvae were reared on diet amended with antibiotics. Similarly, mean mortality of L. dispar fed B.
thuringiensis Cry1Ac toxin (MVPII) at 10 μg/ml of diet was
reduced from 50% without antibiotics to 11% with antibiotics. P. gossypiella responded quite differently. Rearing
on antibiotics significantly increased P. gossypiella mortality from 33% to 75% when fed 10 μg/ml of B. thuringiensis
Cry1Ac toxin (MVPII).
Administration of antibiotics greatly delayed the time
required for B. thuringiensis to kill V. cardui, P. rapae, H.
virescens, and L. dispar larvae, and could not be calculated
in M. sexta because there was no appreciable mortality
(Table 2). Antibiotic feeding increased LT50 values in the
range of 10-fold in H. virescens, 15-fold in V. cardui and 4fold for L. dispar as compared with control larvae. P. gossypiella LT50 values were not affected by rearing on antibiotics or B. thuringiensis treatment.
Restoration of susceptibility to B. thuringiensis by
Enterobacter sp. NAB3
Feeding Enterobacter sp. NAB3, a normal gut bacterium of
L. dispar, restored B. thuringiensis killing ability to antibiotic-reared larvae of M. sexta (from 0% to 61%), V. cardui
(from 8% to 86%), P. rapae (from 8% to 100%) and L. dispar (from 11% to 44%) (Figure 1). Mortality following
ingestion of Enterobacter sp. NAB3, by V. cardui, M. sexta,
H. virescens, P. gossypiella, and L. dispar that had been
reared on antibiotics did not differ significantly from
untreated controls. However, larval mortality of antibiotic-treated P. rapae larvae following ingestion of Enterobacter sp. NAB3 was significantly higher than untreated
controls (25% vs. 8%). In P. rapae, mortality was highest
in larvae reared on antibiotics and fed the combination of
Enterobacter sp. NAB3 and B. thuringiensis, though this
mortality was statistically equivalent to that of larvae
reared without antibiotics and fed B. thuringiensis (Figure
1).

Effect of1
Effect of antibiotics and Enterobacter sp. NAB3 on susceptibility of six Lepidoptera species to Bacillus thuringiensis. Mortality for larvae of each species was analyzed by ANOVA. Each bar represents the mean mortality ± SEM of 36 larvae (three replications with 12 larvae each). Means were separated for significance according to Fisher's protected LSD at P <
0.05 (Vc: F = 189.11, df = 4, P < 0.0001; Ms: F = 47.32, df = 4, P < 0.0001; Pr: F = 280.37, df = 4, P < 0.0001; Hv: F = 93.07, df =

In contrast to the effect of Enterobacter sp. NAB3 on V. cardui, M. sexta, P. rapae and L. dispar, the addition of the
enteric bacterium Enterobacter sp. NAB3 from L. dispar did
not restore B. thuringiensis-induced killing of H. virescens
(3% mortality), even though rearing on antibiotics

reduced susceptibility to B. thuringiensis (89% vs. 11%). In
the case of P. gossypiella, though larval mortality to B. thuringiensis Cry1Ac was higher when larvae were reared on
antibiotics, Enterobacter sp. NAB3 did not increase or
decrease total mortality from B. thuringiensis toxin.

Larval mortality rates were analyzed by PROC PROBIT. Estimates of the time (day) at which 25% and 50% of larvae died for each treatment are
listed. Treatments with no significant mortality (X2 > 0.05) are defined as having no toxicity. A cut-off of > 100 was assigned to upper FL estimates
(note: these are computational outputs, not actual estimates of larval lifespan). Bt mortality rates denoted with * are significantly different (nonoverlapping fiducial limits (FL)) with their respective antibiotic treatment. Values denoted with # are significantly different with the addition of
Enterobacter sp. NAB3, as compared with Bt alone. a Units are days, b NA = Not tested

The impact of B. thuringiensis on time to death (LT25 or
LT50) of V. cardui, P. rapae and L. dispar did not differ significantly between larvae reared on unamended diet and
those fed Enterobacter sp. NAB3 following antibiotic-rearing (Table 2). In the case of M. sexta, total larval mortality
was significantly lower and time to death greater in antibiotic-reared larvae fed Enterobacter sp. NAB3 than in larvae fed B. thuringiensis and reared on unamended diet
(Figure 1, Table 2). There was no significant effect of antibiotics on the time to death (LT50) induced by Enterobacter
sp. NAB3 on P. gossypiella. However, there was a significant effect of Enterobacter sp. NAB3 on P. gossypiella mortality due to B. thuringiensis in the first 12 days of the 21day assay (Table 2). Feeding Enterobacter sp. NAB3 significantly reduced time to 25% mortality in B. thuringiensistreated larvae, when they were reared on diet both without
antibiotics (7.1 vs. 17.9 days) and amended with antibiotics (6.3 vs.15.5 days).

Discussion
These results indicate that enteric bacteria have important
roles in B. thuringiensis-induced killing of Lepidoptera
across a range of taxonomy, feeding breadth, and relative
susceptibility to B. thuringiensis. This impact of enteric
bacteria differs among species. Oral administration of
antibiotics reduced populations of gut bacteria of all five
species in which they were initially detectable, and likewise reduced larval mortality due to B. thuringiensis of five
of the six species tested. Feeding Enterobacter sp. NAB3 to
antibiotic-reared larvae restored susceptibility to B. thuringiensis in four of these five species. These four Lepidoptera contained gut bacteria closely related to Enterobacter
sp. NAB3, which might serve a similar role in larval susceptibility to B. thuringiensis.
The similar results with the cell-free formulation of B.
thuringiensis toxin Cry1Ac (MVPII), E. coli producing

BMC Biology 2009, 7:11

Cry1Aa, and the formulation of cells, spores, and toxin
(DiPel) in L. dispar, that is, the reduction of susceptibility
by antibiotics and the restoration of mortality by Enterobacter sp. NAB3, indicate that our previous results were
not specific to a particular B. thuringiensis formulation. In
addition, this result substantiates our previous evidence
[27,37] that the effect of antibiotics on B. thuringiensis susceptibility is not due to direct effects on the B. thuringiensis
bacterium, as killing was reduced with the B. thuringiensis
cell-free formulation containing only encapsulated
Cry1Ac toxin.
The inability of Enterobacter sp. NAB3 to restore B. thuringiensis-induced killing of H. virescens indicates that while
antibiotics may alter larval susceptibility to B. thuringiensis, the mechanism by which gut bacteria mediate B. thuringiensis-induced killing requires further elucidation, as
do the different responses to gut bacteria in various insect
species. We were unable to detect gut bacteria in H. virescens, which deserves further study to determine whether it
has an as-yet-undetected gut microbiota. Sampling of
additional populations, including field-collected larvae
and additional methods to detect microorganisms of nonbacterial origin are needed to assess their role in B. thuringiensis-induced killing.
Interestingly, P. gossypiella, the only species in which antibiotic treatment did not reduce, and actually increased,
susceptibility to B. thuringiensis, was also the only species
that was singularly associated with a Gram-positive bacterium, Enterococcus casseliflavus. This suggests that E. casseliflavus might protect its host from killing by B.
thuringiensis. Such a protective role has been proposed for
gut bacteria of the tortricid Homona magnanima (Diakonoff) [38], in which Firmicutes related to E. casseliflavus
(Staphylococcus and Streptococcus spp.) reduce B. thuringiensis growth in cadavers. We previously reported that a
related bacterium (Enterococcus faecalis) was no longer
detectable in the guts of L. dispar larvae reared on antibiotics, but unlike Enterobacter sp. NAB3, this bacterium did
not restore larval susceptibility to B. thuringiensis [27]. It is
also noteworthy that P. gossypiella is much more closely
related to H. magnanima than to the other five species
tested in the present study http://www.tolweb.org. The
lack of Gram-negative gut bacteria (Proteobacteria), coupled with findings reported by others, suggests that the
mechanism of B. thuringiensis-induced killing differs
between P. gossypiella and other lepidopteran species
[39,40]. While Enterobacter sp. NAB3 did not increase final
mortality of P. gossypiella due to B. thuringiensis, it reduced
the time until death, with or without antibiotics. This
effect is noteworthy given that larvae were exposed to
Enterobacter sp. NAB3 for only the first two days of the
assay, while they were exposed to B. thuringiensis for the
remaining 21 days, because obtaining treatment effects

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/11

required much longer exposure to B. thuringiensis in P. gossypiella than in the other Lepidoptera used in this study.
Though general descriptions have been proposed to categorize host responses to B. thuringiensis [14], studies have
demonstrated that B. thuringiensis susceptibility is influenced by diverse factors including the insect host
[12,37,41-44], B. thuringiensis strain [45-47], and environmental conditions [48,49]. Our results demonstrate that
in addition to these previously described factors, larval
enteric bacteria affect susceptibility to B. thuringiensis, and
the extent of this impact varies across lepidopteran species. These factors are not mutually exclusive and in some
cases may interact, as, for example, host diet can alter the
composition of enteric bacteria [50,51]. From a pest management perspective, the ability of a non-specific enteric
bacterium from L. dispar to restore B. thuringiensis-induced
mortality of other lepidopteran species may provide
opportunities for increasing susceptibility or preventing
resistance. Moreover, this contribution of enteric bacteria
to host mortality suggests that toxin feeding causes a transition of otherwise benign bacteria into opportunistic
pathogens in some, but not all hosts. These associations
between B. thuringiensis toxin and the gut microbiota of
Lepidoptera may provide a useful model with which to
identify the factors involved in the induction of adverse
effects by normally beneficial or benign bacteria.

Conclusion
We tested the role of gut bacteria in larval susceptibility to
B. thuringiensis among six species of Lepidoptera representing six families. Gut bacteria are required for B. thuringiensis-induced mortality of four of these, Manduca sexta,
Pieris rapae, Vanessa cardui, and Lymantria dispar. This work
also demonstrates that gut bacteria are not required for B.
thuringiensis-induced killing of all Lepidoptera. A reduction of gut bacteria increased P. gossypiella susceptibility to
B. thuringiensis, and antibiotic treatment reduced B. thuringiensis-induced mortality of Heliothis virescens larvae,
even though no bacteria tested restored killing. H. virescens presents an intriguing model in which bacteria may
play a role, but in a more complex manner than in the
other host species.

Methods
Insect selection and rearing
The six insect species were selected primarily for their representation of a range of families across Lepidoptera.
Additionally, these species represent a range of feeding
breadths from polyphagous to monophagous and are
exposed to a broad array of phytochemicals, factors that
are known to influence B. thuringiensis susceptibility. They
are also economically and ecologically important as either
agricultural pests or valued biodiversity indicators.

Eggs of M. sexta, V. cardui, and P. rapae were obtained from
Carolina Biological Sciences (Burlington, NC, USA). Eggs
of H. virescens strain YDK were provided from laboratory
colonies of F. Gould (North Carolina State University,
Raleigh, NC, USA) or purchased from Benzon Research
(Carlisle, PA). P. gossypiella strain AF28 was provided by B.
Tabashnik (University of Arizona, Tuscon, AZ, USA). Eggs
of L. dispar were obtained from culture NJSS at USDAAPHIS (Cape Cod, MA). All eggs were surface sterilized
with a solution of Tween-80 (polyoxyethylene sorbitan
monooleate), bleach, and distilled water as described previously [52]. Larvae of all species were reared in 15 mm
Petri dishes on sterilized artificial diet (USDA, Hamden
Formula: M. sexta, V. cardui, P. rapae, H. virescens;
amended USDA, PBW formula: P. gossypiella) or sterilized
artificial diet amended with antibiotics (500 mg/l of diet
each penicillin, gentamicin, rifampicin, streptomycin).
Larvae were reared in an environmental chamber with a
16:8 (L:D) photoperiod at 25°C.
Bacterial and toxin strains
The B. thuringiensis used in assays with M. sexta, V. cardui,
P. rapae, and H. virescens was a commercial formulation of
B. thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki (DiPel® TP, Valent Biosciences, Libertyville, IL, USA), consisting of cells, toxins
(Cry1Aa, Cry1Ab, Cry1Ac, and Cry2A), and spores. Assays
conducted with P. gossypiella and L. dispar used the MVP
™II formulation of B. thuringiensis toxin (Cry1Ac encapsulated in Pseudomonas fluorescens, Dow AgroSciences, San
Diego, CA USA). Enterobacter sp. NAB3 was originally isolated from the midguts of gypsy moth larva feeding on
sterile artificial diet [50]. For feeding assays, Enterobacter
sp. NAB3 was cultured by shaking overnight in halfstrength tryptic soy broth at 28°C. The overnight culture
was washed once and resuspended in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) pH 8.0 prior to use in assays.
Mortality assays
Assays for M. sexta, V. cardui, P. rapae, and H. virescens
were performed as previously described for L. dispar [27].
All treatments were applied to sterile artificial diet without
antibiotics. Assays were performed with third-instar larvae
of M. sexta, V. cardui, and H. virescens. In the case of P.
rapae, assays were performed using fourth-instar larvae. A
concentration of 25IU, or for H. virescens 100IU, was surface applied in a volume of 1 μl to a standard diet disk (3
mm diameter, 1 mm height) and fed to the larvae on two
consecutive days. In the case of P. gossypiella, a standard
protocol [39] using Cry1Ac diet incorporation with the
diagnostic concentration of 10 μg/ml of diet was
employed. P. gossypiella larvae were provided diet with B.
thuringiensis Cry1Ac for the duration of the assay. To provide comparison with previous results, the MVP™II formulation was also tested with L. dispar at 10 μg/ml of diet
with the surface application method described above. For

establishment of Enterobacter sp. NAB3, larvae reared on
antibiotics were fed 1 μl of a washed overnight culture
(approximately 106 cells) for two days. For P. gossypiella,
Enterobacter sp. NAB3 was surface applied to diet containing B. thuringiensis Cry1Ac for two days, after which larvae
were transferred to fresh diet containing B. thuringiensis
Cry1Ac. Mortality was recorded every 24 hours for 7 days.
In the case of P. gossypiella, mortality recordings were
extended to 21 days according to established protocols
[39].
Analysis of midgut bacteria 16S rRNA genes
Larvae were surface sterilized for 5s in 95% ethanol prior
to dissection. The crop and midgut of 10 larvae of each
species were pooled and total microbial DNA was
extracted as described previously [50]. Bacterial 16S rRNA
genes were amplified by PCR from total DNA using primers 27F-HT and 1492R-HT [53]. Clone libraries were constructed with the pGEM-T Vector system (Promega,
Madison, WI) and electrocompetent E. coli JM109 cells.
Purified plasmid DNA was amplified using the plasmid
primers M13F and M13R and sequenced with 27F-HT. All
16S rRNA gene sequences (~700 bp) were compiled using
the SeqMan program from the DNAStar software package
(DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, WI) and compared with available databases with BLAST to determine phylogenetic
affiliations.
Statistics
Mean larval mortality and standard error were determined
from three replications of 12 larvae each using PROC
MEANS [54]. Means were separated using Fisher's LSD at
P = 0.05. The effect of Enterobacter sp. NAB3 on time to
death of B. thuringiensis treated larvae was analyzed using
PROC PROBIT [54]. Significant differences in LT25 and
LT50 values between treatments were determined based on
probit values with non-overlapping 95% Fiducial Limits
[36].
