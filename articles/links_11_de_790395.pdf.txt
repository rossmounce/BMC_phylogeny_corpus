Abstract
Background: Albugo candida is a biotrophic oomycete that parasitizes various species of Brassicaceae, causing a
disease (white blister rust) with remarkable convergence in behaviour to unrelated rusts of basidiomycete fungi.
Results: A recent genome analysis of the oomycete Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis suggests that a reduction in
the number of genes encoding secreted pathogenicity proteins, enzymes for assimilation of inorganic nitrogen and
sulphur represent a genomic signature for the evolution of obligate biotrophy. Here, we report a draft reference
genome of a major crop pathogen Albugo candida (another obligate biotrophic oomycete) with an estimated
genome of 45.3 Mb. This is very similar to the genome size of a necrotrophic oomycete Pythium ultimum (43 Mb)
but less than half that of H. arabidopsidis (99 Mb). Sequencing of A. candida transcripts from infected host tissue
and zoosporangia combined with genome-wide annotation revealed 15,824 predicted genes. Most of the
predicted genes lack significant similarity with sequences from other oomycetes. Most intriguingly, A. candida
appears to have a much smaller repertoire of pathogenicity-related proteins than H. arabidopsidis including genes
that encode RXLR effector proteins, CRINKLER-like genes, and elicitins. Necrosis and Ethylene inducing Peptides
were not detected in the genome of A. candida. Putative orthologs of tat-C, a component of the twin arginine
translocase system, were identified from multiple oomycete genera along with proteins containing putative tatsecretion signal peptides.
Conclusion: Albugo candida has a comparatively small genome amongst oomycetes, retains motility of sporangial
inoculum, and harbours a much smaller repertoire of candidate effectors than was recently reported for H.
arabidopsidis. This minimal gene repertoire could indicate a lack of expansion, rather than a reduction, in the
number of genes that signify the evolution of biotrophy in oomycetes.

Background
Oomycetes are a group of eukaryotic micro-organisms
of the kingdom Stramenopila that exhibit a wide breadth
of life styles from free-living saprophytes in aquatic and
soil environments, to above ground endophytes and
obligately biotrophic parasites of plants and animals [1].
Despite having filamentous, fungal-like morphology during most of their life cycle, oomycetes are most closely
related to brown algae and unicellular diatoms [1-3].

Terrestrial oomycetes cause some of the most economically destructive plant diseases worldwide such as
late blight of potato (Phytophthora infestans), downy
mildews and root rots in a wide range of seed and forage crops, fruits, vegetables and ornamentals. Albugo
candida (Pers.) Roussel is a key species for comparative
genomics in the oomycetes as the archetypal crop
pathogen in the Albuginales, which is an order that consists exclusively of obligate biotrophs. The Albuginales
diverged early from the Peronosporales, which includes
a wider spectrum of necrotrophs (e.g. Pythium ultimum), hemibiotrophs (e.g. P. infestans and P. sojae) and
obligate biotrophic downy mildews (e.g. Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis) [4].

Disease resistance to oomycete pathogens has been a
major target of plant breeding programs, and also a
focus of genetics research to reveal the molecular basis
of major resistance genes for use in crops [5-7]. Parallel
progress in oomycete genetics has been much slower.
However, recent advances from map-based strategies
have identified several avirulence (Avr) proteins in
downy mildew and Phytophthora pathogens which
match major disease resistance genes in their natural
hosts [8-11]. Advances have also been made in comparative oomycete genomics with public release of reference genomes for three Phytophthora species (P.
infestans, P. sojae and P. ramorum), Pythium ultimum
and H. arabidopsidis from large sequencing consortia
[12-15], and production of expressed sequence tags
(ESTs) for these species [16,17].
Most oomycete Avr proteins share a conserved aminoterminal signal peptide and a specific ‘RXLR’ motif,
which is generally thought to be required for delivery of
proteins with inherent virulence functions into the host
cell [18-20]. The RXLR motif and flanking amino acids
were used to develop algorithms that have enabled identification of more than 370 candidate effector proteins
encoded by the genomes of different Phytophthora species [21] and 134 in H. arabidopsidis, the downy mildew
pathogen of Arabidopsis thaliana [14]. Mutational and
transient expression analyses have confirmed that several Phytophthora proteins have a virulence effector
function in plants [22-24].
Albugo species cause a destructive disease called white
blister rust [25,26]. The disease derives its name from
the appearance of white pustules, due to enzymatic
digestion of epidermal cell wall, on the surface of leaves
and other aerial parts of the host [27]. The pustules
contain masses of dehydrated sporangiospores that upon
re-hydration in water droplets release 4-6 zoospores that
can swim to stomatal openings, encyst and produce a
germ tube which will extend into the sub-stomatal
chamber and penetrate the host cell. A primary vesicle
forms in the host cell, which enables further development of intercellular hyphae in a susceptible interaction
[28,29]. Stomatal infection and spore dispersal via epidermal emergence indicate convergence in life cycle
adaptation to unrelated basidiomycete rust fungi.
White blister rust has been an important experimental
model for investigating the molecular basis of disease
resistance, pathogen virulence, host-parasite speciation,
and the phenomenon of sustained defence suppression
that is typically associated with ‘green islands’ of compatible host tissue [4,6,28,30,31]. For instance, the type
species, Albugo candida (Pers.) Roussel was originally
collected from a wild species Capsella bursa-pastoris
[32] but represents a highly variable complex of physiological races, each of which are pathogens in different

Page 2 of 12

oilseed, vegetable brassicas or other wild crop relatives
[33-36]. More narrowly specialized species occur on
other wild members of the Brassicaceae such as a common pathogen of A. thaliana that was recently named
as Albugo laibachii [37]. Rare accessions of A. thaliana
are susceptible under laboratory conditions to A. candida races 2 and 7, derived from Brassica juncea and
Brassica rapa, respectively, and have thus enabled
genetic characterisation of white rust resistance (WRR)
genes in a non-host crop relative [6,38]. The first example, WRR4, encodes a TIR-NBS-LRR protein which confers broad spectrum resistance to at least four A.
candida races in A. thaliana [6], and also confers resistance in transgenic oilseed crops of B. juncea and B.
napus [39]. The broad spectrum (race non-specific) nature of WRR4 suggests that the multiple physiological
races of A. candida from domestic and wild host species
express a highly conserved avirulence protein.
To support efforts for the genetic improvement of
white rust control in Brassica crops, we have developed
genomic resources for A. candida to enable identification of candidate effector proteins expressed by the
pathogen, including the predicted avirulence protein
recognised by WRR4 in A. thaliana. Here we report
analyses of ESTs from two cDNA libraries and a draft
genome sequence generated from the A. candida race 2
isolate [40] re-designated Ac2VRR (the ‘RR’ suffix was
added to the pathotype name Ac2v to indicate the standard isolate chosen from the collection of the late Dr.
Roger Rimmer). The first cDNA library was constructed
from susceptible B. juncea tissue infected with Ac2VRR,
and a second library was made from Ac2VRR sporangiospores collected from susceptible seedlings.

Results and discussion
EST production and assembly

A cDNA library was constructed from the susceptible B.
juncea cultivar ‘Cutlass’ infected with the A. candida
race 2 isolate Ac2VRR. Approximately 36,000 cDNA
clones (average insert size of 800 bp) were sequenced
from both directions and after sequence quality assessment a total of 50,248 ESTs were collected. A computational pipeline was developed to distinguish plantderived versus pathogen-derived ESTs. ESTs with significant sequence similarity to any plant gene were predicted as being transcripts derived from B. juncea
during infection, whereas the remaining ESTs were
putatively ascribed as originating from the pathogen.
This in silico separation was intentionally designed to be
conservative in assigning a “plant” designation to ESTs,
as we sought to be highly confident about identifying
sequences that were expressed by the pathogen. As a
result, 28% of the assembled cDNAs (14,510) were predicted as being derived from Ac2VRR.

To provide a companion dataset of Ac2VRR transcripts, we also sequenced a full length normalized
cDNA library generated from Ac2VRR sporangiospores.
These ESTs provide a rich sample of transcripts
expressed in the pathogen inoculum, and include genes
encoding proteins important for initiating the infection
process. A total of 38,704 high quality ESTs were
obtained. We compared ESTs from the two complementary libraries to derive a combined data set of 14,376
pathogen transcripts from Ac2VRR, consisting of 2,847
that were present in both libraries, 5,424 that were only
found in the library from infected host tissue, and
11,799 from the second ‘pre-infection’ library generated
from sporangiospores (Additional file 1: Additional
Table S1).
Genome sequencing, assembly, and annotation

To validate the predicted A. candida cDNAs and to
map the physical arrangement of genes within the genome, we generated a draft reference genome by sequencing genomic DNA from sporangiospores of Ac2VRR.
Using pyrosequencing we completed a 20 × shotgun
coverage of the Ac2VRR genome which included a 7 kb
paired-end library (Additional file 1: Additional Table
S2). Assembly of the shotgun data yielded 33.9 Mbps in
2,359 contigs of at least 500 bps with an N50 of 77 kb.
After scaffolding the assembly was resolved to 252 scaffolds covering 34.5 Mbps with an N50 of 375 kb. Average coverage of the assembled data was identified by
performing a reference assembly of the sequencing data
against the assembled sequence using Newbler (454/
Roche). An average coverage depth of 20 × was
observed in the reference assembly and the estimated
genome size was calculated by taking the total number
of base pairs input to the assembly (919,675,861 bps)
and dividing that by the average coverage (20 ×) to yield
an estimated genome size of 45.3 Mb which is very
close to the previously published estimate of 45.6 Mb
[41]. Therefore the scaffolded 34.5 Mb assembly represents 76% of the estimated genome size which compares
favourably to the 82-84% of the H. arabidopsidis genome recently reported [14]. This disparity between the
assembled and estimated genome size could be due to
un-resolved repetitive elements or arise from telomeric,
centromeric and peri-centromeric regions of the genome
which would be inaccessible to these sequencing
methods.
Additional validation of the assembly was carried out
by alignment of 5 BACs from Ac2VRR which were
sequenced as a 7 kb paired-end library using titanium
chemistry. Each of the 5 BACs was individually
assembled using Newbler and in all 5 cases the data
assembled into a single scaffold (Additional file 1: Additional Table S3). The assembled BAC sequences were

Page 3 of 12

then aligned to the genomic scaffolds using MUMMER
[42] and visually inspected (Additional file 1: Additional
Figures S1-S5). The regions of the shotgun genome
assembly which correspond to these BACs show a very
high level of sequence similarity with the genomic
assembly.
The assembled genome had a GC content of approximately 43% with a very minor increase in the coding
regions of 1-2%. Repeat structure analysis using RepeatModeler [43] and RepeatMasker [44] revealed that 17%
of the assembled genome was repetitive (5% LINEs, 6%
LTRs, 3% DNA elements, and 3% Unclassified repeats).
Analysis of the single copy Core Eukaryotic Genes
(CEGs) via CEGMA [45] revealed that the A. candida
genome assembly harbours (88%) CEGs as complete
(215/248 CEGs) or partial models (additional 2 CEGs).
By contrast to the CEGMA analysis, mapping assembled
cDNAs using BLAT [46] onto the assembled genome
revealed that 98% of the expressed genes were identified
within the assembled genome. Therefore while the
CEGMA results might imply less than complete genome
our assessment of the assembly using the cDNA data
demonstrate that this assembly is a High-Quality Draft
assembly of the A. candida gene-space as defined by
Chain et al [47]. De novo gene prediction was accomplished using software, glimmerHMM [48] and GENEID
[49,50], trained specifically for A. candida using our
cDNA data. Combining multiple types of evidence
through the use of Evidence Modeler [51] we identified
a total of 15,824 gene models, implying an average
inter-genic distance of 2,862 bp. From the alignments of
our assembled cDNAs to the genome sequence, it was
apparent that the majority (68%) of predicted genes in
Ac2VRR do not contain an intron. Validation of the
predicted genes in the Ac2VRR genome was achieved
using RNA-Seq data from sporangiospores. RNA-Seq
data was aligned to the genome using Bowtie [52],
TopHat [53], and Cufflinks [54]. The results of the Cufflinks report on the specificity and sensitivity of the
gene predictions (Additional file 1: Additional Table S4)
indicate a very high accuracy in the prediction of genes
within the Albugo candida genome with minor discrepancies at intron/exon junctions.
Using the Ac2VRR draft genome, we screened ESTs
from the pathogen infected plant material and calculated
the number of False Positives, True Positives, False
Negatives and True Negatives for our in silico separation of host and pathogen ESTs (Additional file 1: Additional Table S5). As expected, this method provided a
very high specificity (99%) with low sensitivity (54%).
The low sensitivity arises from the fact that many
housekeeping genes from Ac2VRR share some level of
sequence similarity with orthologous genes in the host
plant. Further validation of A. candida transcripts was

Links et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:503
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/503

achieved by PCR amplification from genomic DNA
(derived from sporangiospores) of a set of 100 cDNAs
assigned computationally as being derived from Ac2VRR
(data not shown). The high specificity indicates that
ESTs being predicted as originating from the pathogen
were confirmed within the genome sequence for
Ac2VRR. Taken together, these measures of specificity
and sensitivity indicate that this computational approach
is useful for identifying expressed genes that are highly
specific to the pathogen in the absence of a genome
sequence for the pathogen.
These genomic data provide an initial opportunity to
assess the genome organisation of A. candida and the
degree to which orthologous genes appear to have been
retained relative to other oomycetes. Using BLAST we
identified 5,975 putative orthologs in P. ultimum, 5,858
to P. infestans, 5,581 to P. sojae, 5,592 to P. ramorum,
and 4,922 to H. arabidopsidis. We investigated whether
A. candida was deficient in the same metabolic pathways as those reported for H. arabidopsidis [14]. Albugo
candida is deficient in the same nitrate, nitrite, and sulphite reductases as H. arabidopsidis (Additional file 1:
Additional Table S6).
The Albugo candida secretome

We identified a secretome comprised of 929 proteins
from the annotated set of Albugo candida proteins,
using previously established criteria [13] such as the presence of amino-terminal signal peptide, a motif indicating that the encoded protein is likely to be secreted by
the pathogen, and lack of additional trans-membrane
domains. The Ac2VRR secretome appears to be of
about 2/3 the size of the P. infestans secretome [55]. In
contrast to the extensive family expansions observed in
Phytophthora genomes, the gene families of the A. candida secretome have relatively few members (Additional
file 1: Additional Table S7). For example, the largest A.
candida secreted protein family consists of 6 members,
whereas the largest family in Phytophthora has hundreds
of members. Even in the pathogen H. arabidopsidis with
a reduced genome, the largest effector family is more
than a hundred members [14]. Interestingly the largest
secreted gene family in A. candida is comprised of six
Crinkler-like (CRN) proteins. Many of the gene families
within A. candida encoded proteins with unknown
functions, however as described below, some families
resembled proteins with functions previously associated
with the elicitation of innate defence in plants and/or
compatibility in plant-microbe interactions.
In order to identify the complement of Pathogen
Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs) and effectors
present in A. candida relative to other oomycetes we
screened the predicted proteins in a manner similar to
Baxter et al. [14]. In general, the A. candida genome

Page 4 of 12

harbours fewer genes in each of the major classes of
PAMP or effector-like proteins (Additional file 1: Additional Table S8).
Cellulose Binding Elicitor Lectin (CBEL) is a cell wall
glycoprotein from P. parasitica var nicotianae which
can elicit host defences in Nicotiana benthamiana [56],
and includes a family of 13 and 15 genes in P. sojae and
P. ramorum, respectively [14]. Only two genes in the H.
arabidopsidis genome have been identified as encoding
CBELs [14]. The genome of A. candida also contains
two putative CBEL genes (Additional file 1: Additional
Table S9) which were identified based on sequence similarity to CBEL from P. parasitica (CAA65843: PpCBEL). Ac2VRR-CBEL1 has a signal peptide which may
result in its secretion and its expression was detected to
be higher during infection than in sporangiospores
(Additional file 1: Additional Table S9). By contrast
Ac2VRR-CBEL2 does not contain a signal peptide indicating that it would be unlikely to be secreted and its
expression was only detected in sporangiospores. Alignment of Ac2VRR-CBEL1, Ac2VRR-CBEL2 with CBEL
proteins from other oomycetes indicates that the canonical structure of CBELs from Phytophthora species is a
sec-dependent secretion signal followed by interleaved
Cellulose Binding (CBD) and Apple domains which can
mediate protein-protein or protein-carbohydrate interactions (Figure 1). Examining the multiple sequence alignment and the molecular phylogeny of the oomycete
CBELs (Additional file 1: Additional Figure S6), variation is observed amongst CBEL orthologs which appears
to be conserved within Oomycete genera. Of note is
that the CBEL from the fish pathogen Saprolengia parasitica has Apple domains in locations which correspond
to the location of the CBDs in the plant pathogens. In
tests performed using a transient assay in N. benthamiana with Ac2VRR-CBEL1, we did not observe necrotic
lesions (Additional file 1: Additional Figure S7). As can
be seen from Figure 1, Ac2VRR-CBEL1 is missing the
corresponding CBD1 domain relative to CBEL from P.
parasitica. Gaulin and co-workers [57] reported that
mutations in any of the aromatic amino acids of either
CBD1 or CBD2 disrupted the elicitor activity of PpCBEL. Both CBEL genes from H. arabidopsidis, another
biotrophic oomycete, appear to lack regions corresponding to the second CBD domain and Apple domains of
CBEL from P. parasitica.
Elicitins belong to PAMPs from plant pathogenic
oomycetes. Elicitins are a highly conserved group of
secreted proteins and includes members such as INF1, a
10 KDa protein from P. infestans that elicits host cell
death in Nicotiana benthamiana [58-61]. The presence
of six cysteine residues is a common feature of elicitins
and has been used to mine databases revealing 156 elicitins (ELI) or elicitin-like (ELL) genes from several

PITG_03639 with the genomic sequence of PITG_03637. The common structure of CBELs from plant pathogens is comprised of a N-terminal
signal peptide and Cellulose Binding and Apple domains.

Phytophthora species [58]. Following this precedent, we
identified nine genes which were either annotated as elicitins via InterProScan or had similarity to an ELL
(Additional file 1: Additional Table S8). Elicitin and elicitin-Like genes were identified as being expressed in
both cDNA libraries and were similar to SOJ7, SOJ5
and an ELK gene Ps-7-10d-ZO, from P. sojae. Additional sequence similarity for the A. candida elicitin-like
genes was observed to P. citrophthora and INF5 from P.
infestans.
Necrosis and Ethylene inducing Peptides (NEPs) are
common among diverse groups of plant pathogens and
are capable of triggering plant cell death [62]. Except A.
candida, all oomycetes with sequenced genomes have
genes encoding NEPs. We performed sequence similarity searches with known NEP proteins and searched the
A. candida proteome using a HMM which has been
used to recover NEP proteins from Phythophthora spp.
and H. arabidopsidis. None of the methods, used to
search for NEPs in A. candida, yielded any candidate
genes.
RXLRs are a group of cytoplasmic effectors that are
abundant in Phytophthora species [13,21]. A. candida
contains a small group of genes that encode secreted
proteins with a variant RXLR motif (Ac-RXL). The
number of Ac-RXL effectors was estimated by string
searches within the predicted proteins with amino-

terminal signal peptides. The numbers of true positives
were derived from subtraction of HMM searches of the
permutated protein sequences [21]. We identified a total
of 26 predicted gene models which contained a putative
sec-dependent signal peptide, lacked homology to
known proteins, and had an Ac-RXL motif (Additional
file 1: Additional Table S10). The consensus Ac-RXL
domain in Ac2VRR appears to be LSSLR(ILKS)L(KQ)SL,
based on an analysis of the amino acid conservation in
the subset of candidate proteins. Ac2VRR-RXL-65 has
an ORF of 450 bps encoding a secreted protein of 17.4
kDa, with low-level expression detected by 1 clone in
infected seedling library, and 2 clones in the sporangiospore library. The predicted signal peptide was located at
the 18th amino acid (NN Score = 0.72; HMM Score =
0.99). When the candidate Ac2VRR-RXL-65 was transiently expressed in N. benthamiana leaves necrosis was
visible at the site of infiltration. A series of eight additional candidate Ac-RXLs were tested for their ability to
transiently induce necrosis when infiltrated into N.
benthamiana. Of these additional candidate Ac-RXLs,
five were able to induce necrosis in N. benthamiana and
three were not (Figure 2 and Additional file 1: Additional Table S10). Further investigation is needed to
determine the nature of necrosis induced in tobacco
and to confirm each effector’s function. Conserved
sequence modules termed in W-, Y-, L- domains from

Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 carrying a pTRBO-Gateway vector expressing Ac2VRR-RXL were performed in duplicate within the
tissues marked by circles (two circles below the mid-vein). Control infiltrations were performed using vectors containing GUS in the two upper
circles. Numbers on each panel correspond to the Ac2VRR-RXL name in Additional file 1: Additional Table S9.

the C-termini of RXLR proteins in Phytophthora and
Hyaloperonospora have been described [21]. These
domains have been shown to be involved in suppression
host Program Cell Death [63]. We searched the
Ac2VRR proteome with a set of HMM based on W-, Y, L- domains in the C-termini of RXLR proteins. None
of these domains were detected in Albugo, which supports the independent origin of Albugo effectors in the
evolution of biotrophy.
CRNs were first identified in Phytophthora species as
secreted proteins that have a conserved LFLAK motif
downstream of the signal peptide [13]. Homologues
have been reported from H. arabidopsidis [14], P. ultimum [64] and Aphanomyces euteiches [65]. CRNs have
been proposed to be an ancient group of host-targeting
proteins that evolved in the oomycete lineage. Using a
modified pattern based on the work of Schornack and
co-worker [66] and custom HMMs based on the

conserved N-terminal domain containing the host-targeting motif FLAK, we identified six gene models as
putative CRNs (Additional file 1: Additional Tables S7
and S8). The host targeting motif LYLAK in A. candida
is slightly different than canonical CRNs. The A. candida CRNs form the largest secreted gene family in A.
candida. By contrast to P. sojae, CRN type effectors are
not highly abundant in A. candida but are similar in
number to P. ramorum. Additionally the highest expression level we could detect was a single EST clone for 4
of the 6 A. candida CRNs in either of our cDNA
libraries. We cloned five of the Albugo predicted CRNs
and transiently expressed them in N. benthamiana
leaves. None of the CRN induced any visible response in
tobacco.
We systematically searched for novel host-targeting
motifs amongst the proteins containing a sec-dependent
secretion signal with the program MEME [67], allowing

Links et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:503
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/503

up to 3 motifs to be discovered simultaneously in the Nterminal 30-100 amino acids. One motif, CHxC occurring in several proteins was recovered. The motif
showed strong conservation with two Cys residues
(Additional file 1: Additional Table S11 and Additional
Figure S8). The MEME output for the CHxC motif was
subsequently used for a HMM search in A. candida. In
total, 40 CHxC proteins were found; all of them had no
detectable homolog in Phytophthora or Hyaloperonospora species. The high level of sequence divergence
from other species is indicative of their specific adaptation in Albugo species.
Putative Twin Arginine Translocase (tat) secreted proteins

While the sec-dependent secretion system is capable of
protein secretion, it is not able to maintain complex
protein conformations during secretion [68]. The twin
arginine translocation (tat) system, which was first
described in plants, appears to be competent for secreting folded proteins and protein complexes [69]. Recent
work has indicated that tat-secreted proteins can contribute to virulence in plant pathogens [70]. To date the
description of functional tat secretion systems has been
limited to bacterial plant pathogens, but there is evidence for the conservation of a component gene of the
tat secretion system being present in P. infestans (tat-C;
GenBank 9695398) [71]. We identified a series of additional tat-C orthologs in the genomes of other oomycetes (Additional file 1: Additional Table S12) by
sequence similarity to the published P. infestans tat-C.
These searches identified putative tat-C orthologs in
four oomycete genera (Phytophthora, Pythium, Hyaloperonospora and Saprolengia). Tat-C genes are typically
encoded within the mitochondrial genome and the
sequence of the tat-C gene itself is highly homopolymeric. We could identify a fragment of a tat-C gene
within the A. candida assembly but full resolution of
the gene was not possible given that pyrosequencing
data is poorly suited to the resolution of homo-polymeric regions. The tat secretion system recognizes a
conserved signal peptide (tat-P) and thus we used an in
silico analysis of the proteomes of oomycetes to investigate whether tat-P signals were a common feature of
the proteins within these organisms (Additional file 1:
Additional Table S13). The number of putative tat-P
containing proteins in the Ac2VRR genome was much
reduced relative to the proteomes of other oomycetes
(Additional file 1: Additional Table S14) and the level of
conservation of the tat-P motif was low across the
sequenced oomycetes (Additional file 1: Additional Figure S9). There were 12 A. candida predicted genes that
bore similarity to other oomycetes and the fact that
there is a level of conservation amongst the oomycetes
would suggest there may be a shared evolutionary

lineage to some of these genes amongst oomycetes
(Additional file 1: Additional Figure S10).

Conclusions
Here we present a summary of the predicted repertoire
of genes from Albugo candida using transcript
sequences and de novo sequence assembly of the pathogen genome. The historical reference isolate of A. candida (renamed Ac2VRR) used for this investigation
represents a major destructive pathogen in oilseed and
vegetable production of brassica crops worldwide. Previous pathology and molecular genetic studies using A.
candida have been important for advancing our understanding of broad spectrum disease resistance and
defence suppression in A. thaliana and the genetics of
avirulence in A. candida [6,30,31].
Albugo candida is a member of the Albuginales, which
is comprised exclusively of obligate biotrophs that have
adapted to a wide diversity of hosts [25,26]. This order
is thought to have diverged early in oomycete evolution
from other major plant pathogens including necrotrophic Pythium species which are the basal lineage in
the Peronosporales, with respect to other hemi-biotrophic Phytophthora species and obligate biotrophic
downy mildews [72]. Thus biotrophy has apparently
evolved independently, in two major lineages of the
oomycetes. Oomycete genomes range in size from the
smallest 18 Mb genome of a necrotrophic Pythium
[73,74] to the largest > 240 Mb genome of potato late
blight pathogen P. infestans [13,74]. The A. candida
genome size (45.3 Mb) is significantly smaller than a
comparable biotroph from the Peronosporales such as
H. arabidopsidis, a common parasite of A. thaliana in
Europe. Similar to H. arabidopsidis [14] and the obligate
fungi [75], A. candida is deficient for enzymes required
for nitrate and sulphate assimilation and has a reduced
number of cell wall degrading enzymes.
The most intriguing contrast found in the comparison
of A. candida genome with other oomycetes is the low
number of RXLR effector-like genes (26 were predicted
as compared to 563 in P. infestans, 350 in the genomes
of P. sojae and P. ramorum and 134 in the genome of
H. arabidopsidis) [13]. This relatively small gene family
in A. candida may be due to weak selection pressure
from the slow evolution of white rust resistance genes
in the host, and/or an apparently minimal repertoire of
effectors in A. candida that have been more effective in
suppressing and avoiding host defences than in members of the Peronosporales. The lack of RXLR genes in
the genome of P. ultimum [15] and their discovery in a
variant (Ac-RXL) form in the A. candida genome suggest that this class of effectors may have evolved independently along with biotrophy in the two major
lineages of plant pathogenic oomycetes. The potential

Links et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:503
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/503

function of candidate CHxC proteins in A. candida also
warrants further investigation as a potential novel class
of effectors.
A similar conclusion can be drawn from other proteins that have previously been associated with pathogencity in plants. For example, NEPs found in many
plant pathogens are capable of inducing cell death in
plants [62]. The P. infestans and P. sojae genomes contain genes that encode 27 and 39 NEPs, respectively.
NEP expression levels in P. sojae correlates with a transition in disease development from biotrophy to necrotrophy [23]. We were unable to identify any NEP
orthologs in A. candida from the transcriptome or in
the assembled genome sequence. The absence of NEP
genes in A. candida supports the suggestion of Qutob
and co-workers [23] that NEPs are associated with
necrotrophy. By contrast to the lack of NEPs in the A.
candida genome the H. arabidopsidis genome contains
10 NEP-like genes. However NEP proteins in H. arabidopsidis show high sequence divergence, probably to
avoid triggering necrosis response in host [14].
Albugo candida and P. infestans are also notably different in the respective number of elicitins and crinklerlike proteins encoded in each genome. We identified
nine elicitin and elicitin-like genes in Ac2VRR, far fewer
than the 156 genes detected in Phytophthora species
[58]. Crinklers are also highly abundant in Phytophthora
species with close to 200 genes reported for P. infestans
[13]. Phythophthora infestans crinkler proteins are typified by an amino-terminal LFLAK domain and are capable of inducing necrosis in planta [22,66]. While we
were able to identify six CRNs in the A. candida genome none were detected as being highly expressed during infection or in sporangiospores and they did not
induce necrosis in planta.
Presence of tat-C orthologs and the conservation of
tat-P containing proteins within the genomes of oomycetes are intriguing. In the case of Albugo candida the
tat-P containing complement of genes is reduced relative to other oomycetes and the genome appears to harbour a tat-C ortholog. While these observations of a
putative tat secretion system within oomycetes are preliminary it forms an intriguing question for further
investigation.
The differences in the repertoire of genes involved in
pathogencity, between A. candida and other oomycetes
indicate that A. candida is highly adapted to life as an
obligate biotroph. Amongst the canonical classes of
pathogen effector molecules, many appear to be nonexistent in the A. candida genome or represent significantly smaller classes of genes. Our analysis of the A.
candida genome provides a basis for investigating the
relationship between an obligate biotroph and its host.
In general, these results portray a remarkably small

Page 8 of 12

eukaryotic genome for an organism that has evolved
intimate biotrophic relationships independently from
other oomycete lineages and has adapted to diverse host
species.

Methods
Plant growth and pathogen inoculation

Seeds of B. juncea ’Cutlass’ (Agriculture and Agri-Food
Canada, Saskatoon Research Centre) were planted in a
coco-soilless mix and grown in a growth chamber under
16 hrs of light and at 18°C days and 15°C night. Pathogen storage and preparation of inoculum has been
described in detail previously [6]. Albugo candida sporangiospores were suspended in distilled water (adjusted
to ca. 2 × 104) and incubated at 14°C for 2 hrs to facilitate release of zoospores. Seven-days-old seedlings were
inoculated on each cotyledon with a drop of the sporangiospores and released zoospore suspensions. Inoculated
seedlings were kept in an incubator at 14°C for 24 hrs,
and then transferred to the growth chamber. Pustules
appeared on the abaxial surface of cotyledons at 7 - 10
days post inoculation (dpi).
Construction of cDNA libraries and sequencing

To construct the cDNA library from A. candida infected
plants, RNA was extracted from Cutlass - AC2VRR
infected seedlings at 10 dpi, and purified using an
mRNA purification kit (GE Healthcare life Science Cat.
# 27-9258-02). cDNA was generated from mRNA and
cloned into the SalI and NotI sites of pSPORT1, based
on instructions provided by the SuperScript cDNA
synthesis kit (Invitrogen, Cat. # 18248-013). Approximately 40,000 clones were sequenced from both orientations using T7 and degenerate oligo-dT primers.
Sporangiospore cDNA was made from spores collected
from heavily diseased seedings of B. juncea ’Cutlass’, at
10 - 14 dpi. A full length cDNA library was made under
contract by Vertis Biotechnology AG (Germany).
cDNAs were directionally cloned into the EcoRI sites of
pJM1 [76]. Sequencing of sporangiospore cDNA clones
was carried out in both directions at the University of
Washington on commercial contract.
RNA Sequencing

Sporangiospore mRNA was extracted from spores of
heavily diseased seedlings of B. juncea ’Cutlass’, at 10-14
dpi. Total RNA was extracted from sporangiospore
using Trizol reagent (Catalogue number 15596-026,
Invitrogen) and further purified by Qiagen RNeasy kit
(catalogue number 74903, Qiagen) according to the
manufacturer’s instruction. mRNA was prepared from
total RNA using Ambion Poly(A) Purist kit (catalogue
number AM1916, Ambion Inc.) based on the instruction
provided by the manufacturer. 2 μg mRNA sample was

Links et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:503
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/503

used for sequencing using Illumina platform. RNA-Seq
was carried out at the NRC-Plant Biotechnology on an
Illumina HiSeq. Data was obtained for 101 cycles of single end sequencing as per the standard Illumina
unstranded protocol. RNA-Seq results were de-multiplexed using the Casava 1.8 pipeline (Illumina). Analysis
of the RNA-Seq data was achieved using Tophat [53]
with parameters modified for the differences between
human gene models and those found in Albugo candida
(-i 20 -I 3000 –min-segment-intron 20 –max-segmentintron 3000). Validation of the gene predictions using
the RNA-Seq data was accomplished using Cufflinks
[54] (-I 3000 –min-intron-length 20 –max-bundlelength 35000).
Transient gene expression in Nicotiana benthamiana

Candidate effectors were cloned into pSK103 a modified
pTRBO [77] vector, a gateway destination vector developed by the laboratory of Dr. Kevin Rozwadowski at the
Agriculture and AgriFood Canada Saskatoon Research
Centre. Briefly, the predicted ORF of each candidate
gene was amplified by PCR using specific primers, with
attB1 and attB2 Gateway cloning sites at the 5’ of forward and reverse primers, respectively. PCR product
was cloned into pDONR-Zeo vector (Invitrogen, Cat. #
12535-035) using BP clonase II enzyme mix (Invitrogen,
Cat. # 11789-020). Each DNA fragment was then cloned
into pSK103 using LR clonase II enzyme mix from Invitrogen (Cat. # 11791-020). A candidate gene cloned into
the psk103-gateway vector was then transferred into
Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 by electroporation. The transformed A. tumafaciens lines were
grown over night, adjusted to an OD600 of 0.02 in
induction media (MES, 10 mM MgCl2 pH5.7, 100 μM
Acetosyringone) and used for infiltration into 4 - 6
week old Nicotiana benthiana leaves as described previously [77].
Warehousing and analysis of ESTs

Sequencing trace files were warehoused and handled
using APED (http://sourceforge.net/projects/aped).
Initial assessments of sequencing efficacy were made by
calculating the maximum sustained Phred [78,79] quality value in five successive windows of 20 bps each. This
was performed with the reads assessed as Good (sustained quality > 20), Fair (sustained quality between 15
and 20) or Poor (sustained quality < 15). While the
initial quality assessment of the reads was based strictly
on sequencing efficacy, Lucy [80] was also used to trim
each read prior to sequence assembly and to screen the
reads for viable cloned products. The assembly of cDNA
sequence data was performed using TGICL [81].
Assembled transcript sequence IDs carry a 3-part name
delineated by underscores. For example the distinct

Page 9 of 12

transcript 681_128_1 indicates that this is a transcript
assembled from cDNA project # 681 (Additional file 1:
Additional Table S1), cluster 128 and contig 1. Distinct
transcripts were annotated via InterPro), after first identifying all putative open reading frames using getORF
[82]. Predicted open reading frames shorter than 50
amino acids were excluded from further analysis.
Genome assembly and annotation

Whole genome shotgun sequencing was carried out for
A. candida isolate Ac2VRR using DNA extracted from
sporangiospores. Spores were ground in pre-chilled
mortars; 200 ml of warmed (37°C) extraction buffer (50
mM Tris pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5%
sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.1 mg/ml Proteinase K, 0.1 mg/
ml glycogen) was added. Samples were vortexed briefly
and incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes. Extractions were
carried out with an equal volume of buffer saturated
phenol followed by 2 extractions in chloroform:isoamyl
alcohol (24:1), with centrifugation of 2 minutes at 800 g
for each extraction. Nucleic acid was precipitated using
1/10th of a volume of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and
2.5 volumes of cold 95% ethanol and pelleted by centrifugation at 8000 g for 15 minutes at 8°C. Pellets were
washed twice with 70% ethanol and re-suspended in 100
ml of TE. Samples were treated with RNAse A (40 mg/
mL for 30 minutes at 37°C) and then extracted with
equal volumes of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol
(25:24:1) followed by a chloroform extraction. The pellet
was stored for an hour at -20°C, precipitated as before,
re-suspended in 50-100 mL of 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.5
and stored at 4°C until sequencing. Roche 454 FLX and
Titanium shot-gun sequencing was carried out at the
NRC-Plant Biotechnology Institute following the procedure as described previously [83] with modifications for
the Titanium chemistry as described in protocols supplied by the manufacturer (Roche, Laval, Quebec). Genome assembly was performed using version 2.3 of the
Newbler assembly software (Roche/454 Brandford CT,
USA). Repeat analysis was performed using RepeatModeler [43] and RepeatMasker [44]. Gene prediction
employed the software, glimmerHMM [48] and GENEID [49,50], trained specifically for A. candida using our
cDNA data. Multiple evidence types for gene prediction
were combined using Evidence Modeler [51]. The
Ac2VRR genome data has been deposited into the public domain in GenBank (Genome project #56025, SRA
submission SRA024984.2).
A Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) library was
constructed from Ac2VRR spores. One week old seedlings of B. juncea cultivar cutlass were inoculated with
Ac2VRR and spores were collected at 10 to 14 days
after inoculation. Library construction was carried out
by Bio S&T Inc. (Montreal, Canada) by cloning the high

Links et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:503
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/503

molecular weight DNA into the HindIII site of pIndigoBAC5 (EPICENTRE Biotechnologies; Madison, USA).
The library contained total of 3,072 BACs with an average insert size of 160 kb. Five BACs were selected for
sequencing to provide external validation of the shotgun
genome assembly. For each of the 5 BACs a 7 kb
paired-end library was generated and the library
sequenced at the NRC-Plant Biotechnology using the
Titanium chemistry as described in protocols supplied
by the manufacturer (Roche, Laval, Quebec). Sequence
data for each BAC was trimmed against the sequences
for the pIndigoBAC5 and the E. coli K12 genome
sequence and assembled using version 2.3 of the Newbler assembly software (Roche/454 Brandford CT, USA).
Separation of putative A. candida ESTs from total cDNA
sequence data

To separate the sequence information of pathogen ESTs
derived from B. juncea infected tissue, we developed a
computational pipeline designed to conservatively characterize experimental ESTs as plant-like if they had any
significant sequence similarity to a plant sequence database. Using a series of six phases (Additional file 1:
Additional Table S15), ESTs were sequentially screened
against the BLAST databases using both BLASTN and
TBLASTX [84]. ESTs with a significant match (1e-15
cutoff) were removed and putatively ascribed as being
plant in origin. The order of the databases within the
screening process was designed to facilitate rapid database searches by screening early so as to reduce the
number of searches against the increasingly large databases in the later phases of the screening. Assessment of
the screening procedure was performed by subsequent
comparisons of the ESTs to both the draft genome
sequence for A. candida Ac2VRR as well as internal
Brassica spp. datasets. Formal calculation of the efficacy
of the pipeline to separate the ESTs was addressed by
calculating the Specificity and Sensitivity (Additional file
1: Additional Equation S1, Additional Equation S2). EST
sequence data has been submitted to dbEST
(HO914811-HO965058, HO965059-HO999999, and
HS000001-HS003763).
Sec-dependent secreted protein annotation

The annotated protein set was subjected to SignalP3.0
prediction [85,86]. A positive candidate is predicted
either by the Neural Network or the Hidden Markov
Model methods with the cleavage site located between
10 and 30 amino acids in length. Membrane proteins
were further separated from the data set if transmembrane domains were predicted in the body of a protein.
Proteins targeted to mitochondria or the Endoplasmic
Reticulum were removed based on IntroPro annotations and SwissProt protein homology (BLASTP evalue

Page 10 of 12

< 1e-5). The final Ac2VRR secretome was found to
contain 939 members. Searches for novel host-targeting motifs was carried out using MEME [67] and
allowing up to 3 motifs within the first 30-100 amino
acids. The protein families were grouped by the program TribeMCL [87], with the parameter I set to be
3.0.
