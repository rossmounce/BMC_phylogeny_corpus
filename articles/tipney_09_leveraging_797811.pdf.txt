Abstract
Background: In response to the frequently overwhelming output of high-throughput microarray
experiments, we propose a methodology to facilitate interpretation of biological data in the
context of existing knowledge. Through the probabilistic integration of explicit and implicit data
sources a functional interaction network can be constructed. Each edge connecting two proteins
is weighted by a confidence value capturing the strength and reliability of support for that
interaction given the combined data sources. The resulting network is examined in conjunction
with expression data to identify groups of genes with significant temporal or tissue specific patterns.
In contrast to unstructured gene lists, these networks often represent coherent functional
groupings.
Results: By linking from shared functional categorizations to primary biological resources we apply
this method to craniofacial microarray data, generating biologically testable hypotheses and
identifying candidate genes for craniofacial development.
Conclusion: The novel methodology presented here illustrates how the effective integration of
pre-existing biological knowledge and high-throughput experimental data drives biological
discovery and hypothesis generation.

Background
The increased use of high-throughput analysis methods,
such as microarrays, in mainstream biological research
has led to a shift from studying small groups of reasonably

well-characterized variables to exploring a complicated
mire of thousands of inter-related variables simultaneously [1]. These methods are powerful, but their outputs
are complicated and difficult to interpret due to the sheer

volume of data produced. Interpretation can be prohibitively time consuming in the absence of computational
assistance.
The ultimate goal of any microarray experiment is to gain
insight into the workings of cellular organisms by understanding the interactions of genes and proteins. For this to
be accomplished, raw data must not only be converted
into information, but this information must also be interpreted in context, to be transformed into timely biological
discovery and knowledge [2]. Currently, the lack of a community-wide consensus on how best to integrate experimental data with information resources limits this
knowledge acquisition [2]. The recent work of Saraiya et
al. (2005) [1] highlighted a "critical need" for tools able
to "connect numerical patterns to the underlying biological phenomena", as current techniques fail to adequately
link microarray data to biological meaning, which limits
researchers' biological insights [1].
One intuitive way to integrate biological knowledge and
microarray data is through protein-interaction networks,
where nodes represent proteins and edges symbolize relationships between proteins [3]. However, focusing solely
on physical protein interactions, such network constructs
neglect a wealth of knowledge currently distributed
among hundreds of existing biological databases (over
1000 listed in this year's Nucleic Acids Research database
issue alone [4]) that is directly applicable to proteins
investigated via microarray experiments. Current protein
network constructs typically focus on a small subset of
this biological knowledge, producing incomplete and
sparsely populated resources. This is a particular problem
for higher eukaryotic organisms such as mice and
humans, for which physical protein interaction data are
limited.
In agreement with Lee et al. (2004) [5] and Leach et al.
(2007) [3], we demonstrate by expanding the definition
of 'interaction' to include functional information that a)
there is enough publicly available biological information
to produce biologically useful, well populated interaction
networks for higher eukaryotic species, b) through the
combination of expression data and functional information, it is possible to provide contextual insight into the
network, and c) it is possible to effectively link to existing
biological knowledge using current technology. Using a
murine craniofacial developmental expression microarray
dataset [6] and a recently published technique for weighting and integrating functional interaction information
[3], we illustrate how the application of context sensitive
methodology leverages the full force of current available
biological knowledge, enabling the translation of complex high-throughput datasets into scientific insight and
discovery.

Methods
Microarray expression data
A comprehensive murine craniofacial developmental
expression dataset was used in this study [6]. Expression
was analyzed through the microdissection of mandibular,
maxillary and frontonasal prominences at time points
E10.5–E12.5 at 0.5 day increments. Expression was measured using the Affymetrix MOE430_2A microarray system. 916 microarray probes, corresponding to 712 unique
MGI identifiers, were clustered using the MANOVA test
statistic in R [7]. Hierarchical complete clustering was
undertaken on the resulting correlation coefficients. The
resultant tree was cut to produce 36 clusters.
Explicit and implicit data sources
Traditionally an 'interaction' between two proteins is
defined as a physical association. Here we expand the
term to include functional relationships between pairs of
proteins (encompassing any type of evidence, including
physical, functional, genetic, biochemical, evolutionary,
and computational evidence [3]). Functional interaction
information was retrieved from a number of different
resources falling into either of two categories: explicit and
implicit. Explicit sources indicate a direct interaction
between a pair of genes/proteins, and include experimentally measured physical, biochemical and genetic interactions,
and
computationally
predicted
gene
neighborhoods, gene fusion events, or conserved phylogenetic profiles. Implicit sources provide information pertaining to an individual gene or protein attribute, which
may be shared by any given pair of genes or proteins. Such
attributes include literature references [8], sequence
motifs (PReMod, InterPro) [9,10], protein categories
(ChEBI) [11], protein complexes [12], phenotypes (as
described by the Mouse Genome Database) [13], cellular
location, molecular function, and biological processes
(Gene Ontology) [14] and pathways (KEGG, Ingenuity)
[3,15,16].
Network construction, weighting and visualization
Genes within any given cluster were defined to be the
nodes in our network constructs; a network was produced
for each cluster identified from the hierarchical complete
clustering stage. Data from both implicit and explicit
sources were used to define arc interactions between pairs
of proteins. Applying the cons NoisyOR methodology of
Leach et al. (2007) [3], the edges between each pair of
nodes were assigned a combined reliability score (network component, σNET) based on the individual reliabilities of the sources asserting the edge [3]. Resultant
networks were viewed using Cytoscape [17].
Network identification and interrogation

sive increase in expression from embryonic day (E) 11 to
E12.5 (Figure 1a), a network of interest was identified
comprising 52 nodes.
By using Cytoscape's ability to display edge attributes,
rapid orientation within the sub-network was achieved.
Recognizing implicit functional themes common to
nodes and edges across the sub-network facilitated the
identification of key information such as shared pathways, processes, locations and phenotypes, as well as
over-represented protein families. This approach provides
a high-level overview of the networks functional composition, which subsequently directs the user towards more
focused analysis of individual nodes and their pairwise
interactions.
Each pair of nodes and associated interactions were
reviewed through the exploration of 'links' within Cytoscape to a number of biological resources (including EntrezGene, GenBank, OMIM, PubMed, MGI, iHOP and
UniGene). Although we were working with murine developmental expression microarray data, our goal was to
gain insight into human developmental processes. Pertinent information is distributed across both mouse and
human resources, thus requiring all investigations be
repeated to ensure that valuable data were not overlooked
simply due to their residing in a species-specific entry or
database. In addition to mining these associated database
entries, a corpus of relevant literature was compiled by following links from each implicit source. This corpus was
then manually assessed and interpreted in order to extract
key information.
The network construction method applied here provides a
maximum of 12 possible functional interactions per edge.
The edge with the most support in this network was
between Myod1 [Myogenic differentiation 1; EntrezGene
ID: 17927 (mouse) and 4654 (human)] and Myog [Myogenin; EntrezGene ID: 17928 (mouse) and 4656
(human)], and was asserted by nine sources (PubMed,
PReMod, GO [BP, MF and CC], MGI Phenotype, InterPro,
ZTransloc and ChEBI). Therefore, even with a structured
interrogation strategy guided by both expression data and
functional interactions, pursuing all informative leads
was not a minor task. Considerable time was dedicated to
the interpretation of the significance of each element. In
this example, approximately 80 hours (10 days) of expert
user time was required. The process is cyclical, where new
information not only informs future discoveries, but previous work is frequently revisited to be viewed within new
contexts.

Results and discussion
A mandibular-specific network: finding novelty
The group of 52 proteins was clustered on the basis of correlated mRNA expression, and with the construction of
the network the goal was to develop biological hypotheses
explaining the observed correlation. Those edges with the
most support (in addition to correlated expression) frequently comprise well-documented relationships
between the proteins encoded by these genes. Those edges
with less support (fewer sources of shared characteristics)
are therefore more likely to represent novel, as-yet uncharacterized relationships and so generate new hypotheses.

In this instance, a number of nodes (eleven) were linked
by edges asserted by a single expert (ChEBI; Chemical
Entities of Biological Interest). ChEBI is a dictionary of
molecular entities focusing on 'small' chemical compounds of biological relevance and encompasses ontological classifications [11]. Interestingly, these nodes and
edges also formed a discrete sub-network (Figure 1b).
Although each of these nodes has reasonable amounts of
associated biological knowledge, only the ChEBI data provided the shared functional interaction categorizations
required for network construction (Table 1). This subgraph of 11 nodes (linked by edges solely asserted by
shared ChEBI categorizations), exhibiting correlated and
progressively up-regulated expression in mandibular tissue during mouse development, thus provided a unique
opportunity to search for truly novel biological hypotheses.
The common theme: calcium and lipids
By observing the sub-graph as a group of 11 interacting
proteins (as opposed to individual or pairs of proteins),
the implicit functional information displayed through the
presence of edges can be taken together to produce a
strong and unified voice capable of highlighting themes
which may have otherwise gone unnoticed if only single,
unassociated implicit resources were used.

In this instance, the ChEBI terms on which the network
was constructed were "calcium(2+)" and "lipids". Cumulative evidence from GO and KEGG highlighted themes
around muscle, acyl-CoA, lipids, signaling, and calcium
signaling. Of the 11 nodes, only Nr5a2 [nuclear receptor
subfamily 5, group A, member 2; EntrezGene ID: 26424
(mouse) and 2494 (human)] had a MGI phenotype association. Nr5a2 knockouts exhibit digestive, alimentary,
and immune disruption, and are embryonic lethals.

Insights from primary literature
Primary databases also provided a source of literature.
Publications attached to GO annotations, GeneRIFs, and
phenotypes (for example) can subsequently be explored
further. Published literature is the gold standard for classification and description of biological functions; however, much of the knowledge in this vast resource is
difficult to assess in the absence of prior knowledge of
what to query for. Searching for pertinent information
regarding all 52 associated genes in the original network

Putative functional associations of ChEBI identified proteins. From insights in the literature associations were found
between Nfatc1, its phosphorylation status [19], calcineurin [20,21] and skeletal/craniofacial dysmorphology [19,22]; Fkbp10,
its role in developing tissues [23] and negative regulation of calcineurin [20]; Nr5a2, its role in PKC-phosphorylation [24],
DSCR1 expression [25](both PKC and DSCR1 are implicated in Nfatc-regulated transcription pathways [19,20]), and retinoic
acid signalling [24,26](implicated in craniofacial development); α-actin (Actn3), its role in mediating calsarcin and calcineurin
interactions [27]; and Mef2, its role in calcineurin-dependent gene-regulation [28]. Megf10 has putative a calcium binding site
(IPR001881), while Sned1 and Galntl1 are found at the sites of embryonic apoptosis and ossification [29,30] but little more was
discovered about these poorly characterised proteins. Yellow ovals highlight those proteins in the ChEBI sub-network.

papers returned. However, the task becomes more manageable when the user has an insight into the relationships among a smaller subgroup of genes. In this instance,
it was more productive to search over the ChEBI-specific
sub-network for Nfatc1, a role in mandibular development, known associations with Actn3, Sned1, Fkbp10,
Galntl1, Efhd2, and Megf10, and any associations with calcium signaling. By having a structured network rather
than a gene list, mining the associated literature became a
more targeted and thus more fruitful task.

ogy to analysis of our craniofacial developmental expression microarray dataset [6] has led to identification and
validation of four genes not previously implicated in
craniofacial development [18]. We believe this methodology will be of significant use to the wider scientific community, and we are therefore also currently working
towards explicitly capturing and automating this analysis
protocol and developing a user interface to facilitate ease
of investigation.

Competing interests
As expected, the published literature provided a wealth of
existing knowledge, and a putative biological pathway
loosely centered on calcineurin was hypothesized to
explain the correlated expression of the 11 genes (Figure
2). In the absence of a network to guide investigations, it
would have been difficult, if not impossible, to associate
these genes in a biologically meaningful way without
domain-specific prior knowledge.
The importance of leveraging pre-existing biological
knowledge
Although the availability and application of highthroughput methods such as expression microarray technology has been a key advance in biological research, the
biological research community is still grappling with how
best to harness the power of this technology. Biologists are
dependent upon computational methodologies to help
them navigate and interpret their raw data, and as such the
ability of the biologist to generate new insights, hypotheses and discoveries is intimately associated to the methodology's ability to assist effective discovery of biologically
meaningful information. Saraiya et al. (2005) [1] highlighted how failing to link microarray data to existing biological knowledge prevents biologists from leveraging
their domain expertise to construct higher level, biologically relevant hypotheses. They argued that it was "imperative that users be able to access and link biological
information to their data" [1]. In agreement with this
point, the study presented here illustrates how effective
access to pre-existing knowledge can drive biological discovery. Inadequate access to this wealth of information
ultimately hinders scientific discovery. We have demonstrated that through the combination of both explicit and
implicit data and a permissive visualization environment
such as Cytoscape, it is possible to link large-scale microarray datasets to biological information in a manner
which facilitates hypothesis generation.

Conclusion
The approach outlined here will be particularly useful
when applied to analyses of large-scale datasets (such as
from microarrays) to help understand the processes implicated in complex, multi-factorial disorders. In addition to
the example presented here, application of this methodol-
