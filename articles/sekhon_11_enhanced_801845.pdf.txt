Enhanced biosurfactant production through
cloning of three genes and role of esterase
in biosurfactant release
Kamaljeet Kaur Sekhon1*, Sunil Khanna2 and Swaranjit Singh Cameotra3

Abstract
Background: Biosurfactants have been reported to utilize a number of immiscible substrates and thereby facilitate
the biodegradation of panoply of polyaromatic hydrocarbons. Olive oil is one such carbon source which has been
explored by many researchers. However, studying the concomitant production of biosurfactant and esterase
enzyme in the presence of olive oil in the Bacillus species and its recombinants is a relatively novel approach.
Results: Bacillus species isolated from endosulfan sprayed cashew plantation soil was cultivated on a number of
hydrophobic substrates. Olive oil was found to be the best inducer of biosurfactant activity. The protein associated
with the release of the biosurfactant was found to be an esterase. There was a twofold increase in the
biosurfactant and esterase activities after the successful cloning of the biosurfactant genes from Bacillus subtilis
SK320 into E.coli. Multiple sequence alignment showed regions of similarity and conserved sequences between
biosurfactant and esterase genes, further confirming the symbiotic correlation between the two. Biosurfactants
produced by Bacillus subtilis SK320 and recombinant strains BioS a, BioS b, BioS c were found to be effective
emulsifiers, reducing the surface tension of water from 72 dynes/cm to as low as 30.7 dynes/cm.
Conclusion: The attributes of enhanced biosurfactant and esterase production by hyper-producing recombinant
strains have many utilities from industrial viewpoint. This study for the first time has shown a possible association
between biosurfactant production and esterase activity in any Bacillus species. Biosurfactant-esterase complex has
been found to have powerful emulsification properties, which shows promising bioremediation, hydrocarbon
biodegradation and pharmaceutical applications.

Background
Biosurfactants are surface active agents of microbial origin. They have the unique property of lowering the
interfacial tension between two liquids. Biosurfactants
act on the interface and are amphipathic molecules with
both hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties present
within the same molecule. In literature the terms ‘biosurfactants’ and ‘bioemulsifiers’ are often used interchangeably owing to their unusual emulsifying property
that makes them the molecules that enhance the accessibility and bioavailability of hydrophobic chemicals by
forming stable emulsions and lowering the surface
tension.

Economy is often the drawback of all biotechnological
processes, especially in the case of biosurfactant production. The economics of producing biosurfactants has
limited its commercial applications [1], but the production cost can be reduced by improving yield, rate, recovery and using cheap or waste substrates.
Biosurfactants have carved a niche for themselves with
their unusual antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral activities [2,3]. In biomedical sciences, some of the uses of
biosurfactants include their role as anti-adhesive agents
to pathogens, making them useful for treating many diseases and as therapeutic, probiotic and pharmaceutical
agents [1,2,4,5]. In addition biosurfactants have a huge
repertoire that enables them to degrade a wide range of
organic pollutants [6]. The prospects of biosurfactants
have a great potential because of their applications in
the petroleum industry [1,7,8] and microbial enhanced

oil recovery [9-14]. The Rhodococcus ruber biosurfactants are found to be 1.4 to 2.3 times more efficient
then the synthetic surfactants (Tween 20, Tween 60) in
enhanced crude oil desorption and mobilization from
soil core, with 65-82% crude oil recovery [15].
There is increasing interest for isolating new enzymes
and new enzyme producing strains for their use in
industrial conversions [16]. Among these enzymes
lipases, esterases, cellulases, xylanases and pectinases
play an important role. Esterases have proven to be versatile enzymes as they catalyze reverse reactions, namely
ester synthesis and transesterification (in non-aqueous
systems), and they can catalyze stereoselective and
regioselective reactions, making them good candidates
for the production of optically active compounds used
in the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries. Moreover, esterases and lipases show activity on a great variety of substrates, with no requirement for added
cofactors [17]. Thus, they are very interesting biocatalysts for industrial purposes such as detergency, flavour
production, paper recycling, chemical synthesis and
resolution of racemic mixtures [18].
The present paper will focus on biosurfactant yield
enhancement through cloning and the role played by
esterases in the production of biosurfactants. The correlation between biosurfactant production and esterase
activity in Bacillus species has not been explored in the
literature so far. The aim of the study is to investigate
the range of renewable and non-conventional substrates
that can be used for enhanced biosurfactant production,
making it a commercially viable process. The recombinant strains need to be exploited and the technology
transfer to biotechnology industries can be extremely
beneficial.

Materials and methods
Bacterial strains, vectors and growth conditions

Bacillus subtilis (designated as Bacillus subtilis SK320
throughout the paper) was isolated from endosulfan
(organochlorine pesticide) sprayed cashew plantation soil
in Ernakulum, Kerala (India). The isolate was identified
as Bacillus subtilis by MTCC, Institute of Microbial
Technology, Chandigarh, India. E. coli DH5a was also
obtained from MTCC. pGEM-T easy vector system was
obtained from Promega Corporation, Madison, USA and
was used according to the manufacturers instructions.
Bacillus subtilis SK320 and the three recombinants were
grown at 37°C, 120 rpm in the basal media Bushnell Hass
Broth (BHB) in a 100 ml flask with 0.5% olive oil (v/v)
(Olio di Oliva, Sasso, Milano, Italy) as a carbon source.
Biosurfactant and/or Bioemulsifying Activity

Bioemulsifying activity of the biosurfactant was measured
with the culture supernatant obtained by centrifuging the

Page 2 of 10

bacterial growth at 12,000 × g at 4°C for 30 min. Later 5
ml of supernatant in a glass tube and 100 μl of mobile oil
was added and the contents were vortexed vigorously for
1 min at full speed and then left undisturbed for 10 min
[19]. Bioemulsifying activity of the biosurfactant was
measured at 550 nm spectrophotometrically (U-2001,
Hitachi) in glass cuvette against blank of un-inoculated
medium (5 ml) with 100 μl of mobile oil vortexed similar
to the sample. Mobile oil or 2T Engine oil (Racer 2, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd, Govt. of India Enterprise, Mumbai) was obtained from a local petrol station.
It is recommended as a pre-mix and oil injection system
for 2 stroke engines.
Surface tension measurement

The reduction in surface tension (dynes/cm) was measured by the ring method (Du-Nouy principle) using a
tensiometer (Petro-Diesel Instruments Company, Jencon, Calcutta, India). The purified biosurfactant from
Bacillus subtilis SK320 and the recombinants were dissolved at a concentration of 1 mg/100 ml i.e. CMC of
10 mg/L in distilled water and used for surface tension
measurements against distilled water as a control.
Esterase Activity

Esterase was measured using 100 mM para-nitrophenyl
(pNp) acetate as substrate and 75 mM phosphate buffer
containing 10 mM MgSO 4 (pH 7.0). After 30 min of
incubation at 37°C enzyme activity was monitored spectrophotometrically (U-2001, Hitachi) by measuring the
increase in optical density at 405 nm. Specific activity
was expressed as μmoles/mg protein/min [20].
Cloning of the biosurfactant genes

Chromosomal DNA from Bacillus subtilis SK320 was
isolated using the Rose method [21] and amplified using
gene specific primers (Table 1). The primers were
designed using the following website: http://frodo.wi.mit.
edu/primer3. The primers were prepared by Operon Biotechnologies, Nattermannallee, Germany and supplied by
Genetix Biotech Asia Private Ltd, New Delhi, India. The

reverse primer, forward primer, dNTP mix, Taq DNA
polymerase, Taq buffer and sterile water was amplified
using GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems,
Foster, CA, USA), with the program set to denaturation
at 94°C for 5 min, annealing at 45°C for 1 min and extension at 72°C for 1 min for a total of 30 cycles, with a final
extension at 72°C for 10 min. The PCR amplified product
of the chromosomal DNA was ligated and cloned into
the pGEM-T easy vector system. Transformation was
carried out by CaCl 2 method [22]. The transformants
were selected on Amp+ X-gal IPTG plates. The nucleotide sequences of the genes viz. sfp, sfp0 and srfA were
determined by the dideoxy-chain termination method
[23] using the Applied Biosystems DNA sequencer.
Determination of the expression of biosurfactant genes

For testing the expression of the biosurfactant genes,
Bacillus subtilis SK320 and the positive transformants
(recombinants) viz.BioS a, BioS b and BioS c were
grown on a basal medium containing 0.5% (v/v) olive oil
at 37°C, respectively. Ampicillin was supplemented in
the medium used for growing the positive transformants. Growth, biosurfactant and esterase activities
were estimated at an interval of 24 h for 5 days,
respectively.
Recovery and purification of the biosurfactant

Bacillus subtilis SK320 and the recombinants were
grown in BHB containing 0.5% olive oil (v/v) as the carbon source. After 48 h, when the biosurfactant activity
was observed to be maximum in the supernatant, the
culture was harvested at 7000 × g for 30 min at 4°C.
Supernatant was filtered through Whatman No. 42 filter
paper and 3 volumes of chilled acetone was added to
the supernatant and left at -20°C. After 18-24 h the
solution was centrifuged at 7000 × g for 30 min at 4°C,
air dried and then dissolved in water. This step was
repeated 2-3 times for purification. The final precipitate
was dissolved in water and the sample was lyophilized
(Heto LyoLab 3000 Lyophilizer, Germany). The lyophilized sample was then estimated for biosurfactant activity at 550 nm. For estimating total biosurfactant
recovery the purified (lyophilized) powder was weighed
and reported as g/L.
Characterization of the biosurfactant
Lipid

The dried partially purified sample was extracted with
chloroform: methanol solution (2:1, v/v). The suspension
was allowed to stand at room temperature for 5-10 min
and then centrifuged and supernatant collected. An aliquot (0.2 volume) of distilled water was added to the
sample so as to remove any traces of chloroform:methanol, if present. The sample was then vortexed. After

Page 3 of 10

giving 2-3 washings with MQ water, the lower layer
containing the lipid was transferred to a fresh tube and
the sample was lyophilized and weighed to get the total
lipid content.
Ash

A known weight of lyophilized sample was taken in a
pre-weighed glass crucible and kept in the oven for 1 h
at 80°C. After evaporating the excessive moisture the
charred sample was transferred to the silica crucible and
weighed. The sample was then kept in an electric muffle
furnace at 550 ± 50°C for 5 h. The cooled crucible was
then weighed for residual ash.
Protein

Extracellular protein in the supernatant and protein
content in the purified biosurfactant was measured at
310 nm using the biuret method [24] using bovine
serum albumin as standard. The total volume of protein
sample was made up to 2 ml with Milli-Q water and 1
ml of biuret reagent. After 10 min incubation at room
temperature, the absorbance was measured at 310 nm
against a reagent blank in a spectrophotometer (U-2001,
Hitachi).
Carbohydrate

The carbohydrate content was measured at 620 nm
using the anthrone method [25] using glucose as standard. The total volume was made to 2 ml with sample,
distilled water and 2 ml of anthrone reagent (0.2 g
anthrone in 100 ml conc. H2SO4). The test tubes were
covered and kept in a boiling water bath. After 10 min,
the test tubes were cooled down by incubation on ice
for 5 min to stop the reaction. Absorbance was read at
620 nm against a reagent blank.
Effect of Proteinase K and Lipase (Steapsin) on purified
biosurfactant

Proteinase K and Lipase were procured from MBI Fermentas and Himedia, respectively.
Proteinase K

The purified biosurfactant (1 mg/ml) was incubated with
different concentrations of Proteinase K (viz. 0.5, 1, 2, 4
mg) at 37°C. Samples were withdrawn at different time
intervals (i.e. 10, 30, 60, 120 mins) and assayed for biosurfactant activity at 550 nm.
Lipase (Steapsin)

The purified biosurfactant was incubated with 100, 200,
500, 700 and 1000 μg of lipase and incubated at 37°C. Samples were withdrawn at regular intervals (i.e. 30, 60, 90, 120
mins) and assayed for biosurfactant activity at 550 nm.

Results and Discussion
Regulation of Biosurfactant production with various
substrates

Bacillus subtilis SK320 was grown on basal medium
containing various substrates (0.5%, v/v) and monitored

Sekhon et al. Microbial Cell Factories 2011, 10:49

for growth and biosurfactant activity. The various carbon sources used were vegetable oil, glycerol, maltose,
n-dodecane, mobile oil, crude oil, olive oil, glucose and
sucrose. Bacillus subtilis SK320 was also grown on
tween 40, tween 60 and triton X-100, but as these three
substrates are also effective synthetic surfactants, formation of emulsion (foam) in the medium at 37°C was
observed with increasing incubation time, this made it
difficult to analyse the growth. Among the various carbon sources tested for biosurfactant production by
Bacillus subtilis SK320 in basal medium olive oil, glucose, glycerol and sucrose, produced maximum activity
in the range of 0.859 to 0.121 (optical density). Low
levels of biosurfactant activity in the range of 0.074 to
0.014 (optical density) were detected when grown in
the presence of maltose, vegetable oil, mobile oil, ndodecane, crude oil (Table 2). During the years wide
range of carbon sources such as peat hydrolysate for B.
subtilis [26], soy bean curd residue (okara) for B. subtilis YB8 and B. subtilis MI113 [27], n-hexadecane, paraffinic oil, babassu oil for P. aeruginosa PA1 [28], and
soybean oil, safflower oil, glycerol for P. aeruginosa
GS9-119 and DS10-129 [29], glycerol [30], molasses
medium supplemented with soya-okra for P. aeruginosa MTCC 2297 [31] have been reported to induce
biosurfactant production. Cheap substrates such as
vegetable oils and oil wastes, plant-derived oils, lactic
whey and distillery wastes, starchy substrates, olive oil
mill effluent, animal fat, soapstock and molasses have
the potential for enhancing biosurfactant production
[32]. The oils mostly used for biosurfactant production
are edible oils and are not cheap [33]. The novelty and
viability of the biosurfactant production process
depends equally on the yield and the rate of production. Therefore, the oils used for biosurfactant production should not be very expensive but should be
economical enough to give the industry a cost-effective
technology.

The biosurfactant activity in the supernatant, containing olive oil as substrate, increased with time. Maximum
activity was achieved during the stationary phase
between 48 to 72 h of growth when the nutrient limiting conditions started prevailing in the growth medium.
The production of surfactin in culture broth of Bacillus
subtilis [34], rhamnolipids by Pseudomonas aeruginosa
[35], emulsan in Acinetobacter calcoaceticus RAG-1
[36], exopolysaccharide in A. calcoaceticus BD4 [37] and
rhamnolipid AP-6 in P. fluorescens 378 [38] were all
found to be growth associated. The rate of growth of all
these bacteria varied but maximum biosurfactant activity
was only observed when the bacterium entered the stationary phase irrespective of its growth rate. It was postulated that in bacteria, growth and product formation
(biosurfactant) proceed as separate events [39]. Bacillus
subtilis SK320 grew luxuriantly in the basal medium and
was also capable of emulsifying olive oil to a greater
extent. The low level of biosurfactant activity at 120 h
coincided with the complete emulsification of olive oil
in the basal medium, visualized as a milky appearing
growth medium. Similar results showed that the bioemulsifier emulsan produced by oil-degrading microorganism Acinetobacter venetianus RAG-1 [36] and the
biosurfactant produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa [40]
was responsible for forming stable oil-water emulsions
with hydrophobic substrates such as hexadecane. The
extracellular protein analyzed was maximum (6.97 mg/
ml) when olive oil was used as the substrate followed by
vegetable oil, glycerol and glucose. The protein content
was found to be minimum with mobile oil and crude oil
with values as low as 0.18 and 0.23 mg/ml.
Induction of esterase activity

Esterase activity was found to be correlated to biosurfactant production in Bacillus subtilis SK320. Olive oil was
the best inducer of esterase activity amongst all the substrates with the highest activity of 4.382 IU/ml, followed

by maltose, glycerol, sucrose and vegetable oil with
activities of 0.7929, 0.6616, 0.5097 and 0.4248 IU/ml,
respectively (Table 2). This is in contrast to the observation in Pseudomonas fluorescens DSM 50106, Rhodosporidium toruloides, Pseudomonas putida NRRL B18435 and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus RAG-1 where
maximum esterase activity was observed in a nutrient
rich medium with glucose as the carbon source
[20,41-43]. But it was shown that production of type I
and II esterases by Bacillus licheniformis S-86 was substantially enhanced by 1.6 and 2.2 times, when oils and
surfactants were supplied as carbon sources [44]. The
majority of the esterase produced in Bacillus subtilis
SK320 was extracellular as the cells, after sonication,
gave very low esterase activity. In Acenitobacter sp. [45],
most of the esterase activity was found to be cell associated and only slight amounts appeared in the external
medium during late growth whereas in A. calcoaceticus
RAG-1 [46] esterase activity was found both in cell free
broth and on the cell surface. With a decrease in the
cell-bound activity there was an increase in the cell free
esterase activity during growth. In Bacillus subtilis
SK320 the production of esterase increased progressively
during growth following the same trend as that of the
biosurfactant production and was maximum at 72 h.
After 72 h there was a reduction in the esterase activity
after which it remained constant until 192 h. In A calcoaceticus BD 413 [47] a large amount of esterase and
biosurfactant activity was produced during the transition
from the exponential to the stationary phase, while in A
calcoaceticus RAG-1 [36] esterase activity followed the
growth pattern, with the maximum activity being
achieved during the stationary phase of growth. In Acinetobacter venetianus RAG-1 the release of emulsan
from the bacterial cell surface was mediated by the
action of a cell surface esterase, which is one of the key
components in the active emulsan-protein complex and
itself appears in the growth medium just prior to the
appearance of the cell-free emulsifying activity [47].
Cloning and expression of biosurfactant genes

Bacillus subtilis SK320 and recombinant strains BioS a,
BioS b and BioS c, cultivated on a basal medium containing 0.5% (v/v) olive oil at 37°C were compared for
their growth, biosurfactant and esterase activities.
Growth was observed to be maximum in Bacillus subtilis SK320 followed by BioS a, BioS b and BioS c, whereas
biosurfactant and esterase activities were found to be
enhanced in the recombinants in comparison to the parent strain (Table 3). There was negligible growth in the
case of E.coli DH5a strain when it was grown on a
basal medium containing olive oil indicating that E.coli
DH5a was unable to utilize olive oil as the carbon
source. The screening of biosurfactant and esterase

positive strains was also confirmed from the fact that E.
coli strains DH5a, HB101 and MM294 could not grow
on simple triglycerides [43]. There was no apparent biosurfactant and esterase activity found in the parent E.
coli DH5a, whereas the recombinant strains which possess an active biosurfactant gene were now able to utilize olive oil as a carbon source. Data revealed that the
biosurfactant genes were not only successfully cloned
and expressed but they were over-expressed in BioS a,
BioS b and BioS c showing a twofold increase in the
activity then the parent strain (Table 3). The biosurfactant activity increased in the first 24 h producing the
maximum activity between 48 to 72 h. After 72 h biosurfactant activity started showing a decline reaching a
minima at 120 h. Maximum biosurfactant activity was
observed in case of the recombinant BioS b followed by
BioS a and Bio c. Olive oil supplemented in the culture
media was found to be completely emulsified after 120
h. Cloning of the biosurfactant genes from Bacillus subtilis SK320 into E.coli not only resulted in the expression of the biosurfactant activity but also conferred
esterase production in the recombinant cells. Similarly,
cloning, sequencing and characterization of a genomic
region of B. subtilis B3 comprising srfDB3, aspB3, lpab3
and yczEB3 genes was carried out and it was observed
that the srfDB3 gene encodes thioesterase which is
required for biosynthesis of surfactin in B. subtilis [48].
Esterase activity of BioS a, BioS b and BioS c was found
to be enhanced when compared to Bacillus subtilis
SK320.
Phylogenetic analysis of three biosurfactant genes

The genes sfp (1210 bp), sfp0 (642 bp) and srfA (707 bp)
were successfully cloned and sequenced using an
Applied Biosystems DNA Sequencer (DDBJ/EMBL/GeneBank accession numbers are: EU822921, EU822922 &
EU822923). The DNA sequences were used to infer
functional and evolutionary relationships between
sequences in the database and to identify members of
gene families using the NCBI BLAST (http://www.ncbi.

Sekhon et al. Microbial Cell Factories 2011, 10:49
http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/10/1/49

nlm.nih.gov/BLAST) facility. The results revealed
sequence homology of the sfp, sfp0 and srfA genes with
Bacillus subtilis surfactin synthetase gene, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus subtilis srfAA, several lipases from yeast
and filamentous fungi to name a few. In addition much
weaker similarities were also observed. Based on the
matching sequences found with BLAST, it was estimated that the greatest overall similarity (99.0%) was
with the biosurfactant and esterase genes of Bacillus
subtilis. Multiple alignments of the deduced amino acid
sequences from sfp, sfp0 and srfA were carried out with
two esterase gene sequences viz. Bacillus sp. NK13
esterase gene (Accession number: DQ196347) [Liu G,
Tan Z, Zhang J. Cloning of esterase gene from Bacillus
sp. NK13. Submitted] and Bacillus clausii KSM-K16
esterase gene (Accession number: AP006627) [49]. The
results indicated similarity and conserved family characteristics between the biosurfactant and esterases genes,
confirming our prediction of a possible correlation
between the two activities (Figure 1).
Purification and characterization of Biosurfactant

Bacillus subtilis SK320 and the recombinants BioS a,
BioS b and BioS c, were grown in a basal medium with
0.5% (v/v) olive oil and the purified biosurfactant was
lyophilized to obtain a clear powder. The biosurfactant
yield (%) obtained from BioS a, BioS b and BioS c was
much higher than that obtained for parent Bacillus subtilis SK320 i.e. 1.2 g/L (Table 4). Surface tension values
were found to be 72.1 dynes/cm for tap water and 70.7
dynes/cm for sterile Milli-Q water. Biosurfactant
extracted from the parent Bacillus subtilis SK320 was
able to reduce the surface tension of tap water to 40.1
dynes/cm, whereas the biosurfactant obtained from
recombinants BioS a, BioS b and BioS c reduced the surface tension of tap water to as low as 38.4, 35 and 30.7
dynes/cm, respectively (Table 4). Results suggested that
the successful expression of the biosurfactant gene was
responsible for the surface tension reduction by the biosurfactants. Total production yield of the lipopeptides
from Bacillus subtilis BBK-1 was about 480 mg/L at 30°
C for 24 h [50], whereas Bacillus sp. strain IAF 343 gave
the yield of 1 g/L on medium containing only water
soluble substrates [19]. P. aeruginosa DS10-129 produced 4.31, 2.98 and 1.77 g/L rhamnolipid biosurfactant
using soybean oil, safflower oil and glycerol as substrates
[51]. Bacillus cereus IAF 346 produced a monoglyceride
biosurfactant that lowered the surface tension of water
to 28 mN/m with a yield of 1.6 g/L (pH 6.5) and 1.7 g/L
(pH 7.0) [19]. B. subtilis grown on medium containing
4% glucose gave the yield of 1-2 g/L of biosurfactant
with minimum surface tension of 27 mN/m [52]. B.
licheniformis JF-2 anaerobically produced biosurfactant

when grown in glucose rich medium and reduced surface tension of water to 28 mN/m [53]. Purified lichenysin A from B. licheniformis BAS50 decreased the surface
tension of water to 28 mN/m with a yield of 70-160
mg/L [54]. The maximum yield of surfactin was
approximately 110 mg/lit by the strain B. subtilis S 499
[55]. In a very recent study, biosurfactant production of
1.74 g/L was observed when the microbial consortium
of Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas sp. (ERCPPI2) was grown on minimal salt medium supplemented
with olive oil (1%, w/v) and 1% (w/v) sodium nitrate
supplemented with 1.39% (w/v) K 2 HPO 4 at 40°C and
150 rpm after 48 h incubation. The consortium
ERCPPI-2 was able to reduce the surface and interfacial
tensions to 31.7 and 0.65 mN/m [14].
Various biochemical and physiological properties of
the biosurfactants were studied after its purification.
The biochemical analysis revealed that the purified biosurfactant from BioS a had 89.70% lipid, 14.9% ash,
7.21% protein and 3.08% carbohydrate content. Biosurfactant from BioS b contained 90.30% lipid, 15.20% ash,
6.73% protein and 2.94% carbohydrate content whereas,
biosurfactant obtained from BioS c contained 91.0%
lipid, 15.38% ash, 6.26% protein and 2.70% carbohydrate
content, respectively. The biosurfactant from all the
three recombinant strains had a high lipid content
thereby affirming that the biosurfactants belong to the
class of lipopeptides. These results were in accordance
with Bacillus subtilis SK320 biosurfactant, which had
7.45% protein, 89.40% lipid, 3.15% carbohydrate and
14.5% ash content, respectively.
Boiling or incubating the biosurfactant with proteinase
K led to a decrease in biosurfactant and emulsifying
activity, indicating that the protein (esterase) moiety was
essential for biosurfactant activity (Figure 2). The
decrease in activity of the purified biosurfactant at pH
8.0 and above also indicated an active role of the protein
moiety, as the loss in activity at high pH may be due to
the denaturation of the protein. Lipids constituted a
large percentage of the purified biosurfactant and therefore regulated the biosurfactant activity in a significant
manner. The incubation of biosurfactant with lipase
resulted in appreciable loss in biosurfactant activity (up
to 100%) (Figure 3). In Pseudomonas PGI [56], the protein moiety was shown to be essential for biosurfactant
activity as incubation of the biosurfactant with chymotrypsin reduced both solubilizing and emulsifying activities to very low levels. Similarly, in A. calcoaceticus
BD4, the polysaccharide moiety of the biosurfactant
alone showed no emulsification activity, however polysaccharide released with protein during growth showed
potent emulsification activity [57]. In A. calcoaceticus
RAG-1, the protein moiety of the emulsan was not at all
involved in the activity as the deproteinized emulsan

retained all its biosurfactant activity. Emulsan was later
characterised to be a lipopolysaccharide [46]. The biosurfactant of Bacillus subtilis SK320 contained 7.45%
protein (w/w), which was almost one third when compared to 34% (w/w) in Pseudomonas PG-1 [56]. The
amount of lipid was more when compared with the lipid
content (32%, w/w) in Pseudomonas PG-1. The difference in the chemical composition could be due to the
different growth conditions. Bacillus subtilis SK320 was
grown on basal medium with olive oil as the carbon
source, while Pseudomonas PG-1 was grown in minimal
medium with hexadecane/pristane as the substrate
[46,58].

Conclusions
Bacillus subtilis SK320 produces a biosurfactant that
belongs to the class of lipopeptides having excellent
emulsifying properties. It has been shown that biosurfactant production is mediated by extracellular esterase in
the growth medium of Bacillus subtilis SK320 and its
recombinant strains. Biosurfactants devoid of protein or
lipid components showed much lower emulsifying

activity. The recombinant strains showed a twofold
increase in the esterase activity and biosurfactant yield.
The biosurfactants were capable of reducing the surface
tension of water to a significantly lower value. These
properties are of great importance in bioremediation
and various other industrial applications.
