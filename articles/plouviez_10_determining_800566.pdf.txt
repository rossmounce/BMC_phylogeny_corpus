Pacific Rise in the tube-dwelling polychaete
Alvinella pompejana

Abstract
Background: Comparative phylogeography recently performed on the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (mtCOI)
gene from seven deep-sea vent species suggested that the East Pacific Rise fauna has undergone a vicariant event
with the emergence of a north/south physical barrier at the Equator 1-2 Mya. Within this specialised fauna, the
tube-dwelling polychaete Alvinella pompejana showed reciprocal monophyly at mtCOI on each side of the Equator
(9°50’N/7°25’S), suggesting potential, ongoing allopatric speciation. However, the development of a barrier to gene
flow is a long and complex process. Secondary contact between previously isolated populations can occur when
physical isolation has not persisted long enough to result in reproductive isolation between genetically divergent
lineages, potentially leading to hybridisation and subsequent allelic introgression. The present study evaluates the
strength of the equatorial barrier to gene flow and tests for potential secondary contact zones between A.
pompejana populations by comparing the mtCOI gene with nuclear genes.
Results: Allozyme frequencies and the analysis of nucleotide polymorphisms at three nuclear loci confirmed the
north/south genetic differentiation of Alvinella pompejana populations along the East Pacific Rise. Migration was
oriented north-to-south with a moderate allelic introgression between the two geographic groups over a narrow
geographic range just south of the barrier. Multilocus analysis also indicated that southern populations have
undergone demographic expansion as previously suggested by a multispecies approach. A strong shift in allozyme
frequencies together with a high level of divergence between alleles and a low number of ‘hybrid’ individuals
were observed between the northern and southern groups using the phosphoglucomutase gene. In contrast, the
S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase gene exhibited reduced diversity and a lack of population differentiation possibly
due to a selective sweep or hitch-hiking.
Conclusions: The equatorial barrier leading to the separation of East Pacific Rise vent fauna into two distinct
geographic groups is still permeable to migration, with a probable north-to-south migration route for A.
pompejana. This separation also coincides with demographic expansion in the southern East Pacific Rise. Our
results suggest that allopatry resulting from ridge offsetting is a common mechanism of speciation for deep-sea
hydrothermal vent organisms.

Background
Many population genetic models have been proposed to
describe how individuals disperse between geographically separated localities including n-island models [1,2],
stepping-stone [3] or isolation-by-distance [4,5] models,
and have subsequently been adapted to a metapopulation context to integrate population dynamics through
time (i.e. local extinction and recolonisation rates;
reviewed in [6,7]). Nevertheless, a physical barrier to dispersal can disrupt the relationship between genetic differentiation and migration rate: all models show that the
establishment of a long-term physical barrier to dispersal abruptly reduces or stops gene flow between populations and leads to a rapid change in allele frequencies
on either side of the barrier that may be dampened or
accelerated depending on the type of selection at specific loci. This often leads to the fixation of mutations
(divergence) and reciprocal monophyly for many loci,
provided that no lineage extinction or population
admixture occurs [8]. Secondary contact events can produce genetic incompatibilities and clinal allelic distributions whose shapes depend primarily on the strength of
selection against hybrids [9].
Deep-sea hydrothermal vents represent a patchily distributed habitat (sometimes separated by thousands of
kilometres) suggestive of a one-dimensional steppingstone model over 60 000 kilometres of globe-encircling
ridge crests [10]. Because of their dependence on ‘hot’
sulphidic fluids from vent chimneys, deep-sea hydrothermal vent species display an island-like distribution
along ridges. This habitat distribution raises questions
about vent species’ dispersal among sites and the putative occurrence of physical barriers to dispersal [11,12].
It has been hypothesised that hydrothermal vent species
disperse primarily in their local neighbourhood [13], as
in the Kimura and Weiss [3] one-dimensional steppingstone model, and thus follow an isolation-by-distance
model [11]. However, in most cases, allozyme studies
have failed to detect isolation-by-distance among populations of hydrothermal vent species (e.g. [14,15]), suggesting that an n-island model [1] is a better description
of gene flow in vent systems.
Amongst vent species, the deep-sea hydrothermal vent
polychaete Alvinella pompejana, which only lives at the
top of hydrothermal-vent chimneys of the East Pacific
Rise (EPR) between 38°S and 27°N (Guaymas Basin), has
been described as a pioneer species because it is the
first species to colonise new hot-sulphide edifices [16].
The larval development of this tube-dwelling worm is
still largely unknown, but large yolk-rich eggs (150-200
μm), suggest that larval development is lecithotrophic
and could be delayed in cold (1.5-2°C) water away from
vent fields [12]. This worm species reproduces via

Page 2 of 15

internal fertilization and has nearly continuous gametogenesis, maximising its reproductive effort [17]. During
mating, spermatozoids are transferred to the female in a
spermatecae, and multiple paternity is possible [18].
This kind of reproductive mode is known to strongly
favour larval retention in the immediate surrounding of
the source population, which may be advantageous in
unstable and patchy environments [19]. Given this set of
reproductive characteristics and the recurrent extinction
and recolonisation of vent edifices, Jollivet et al. [20,21]
have proposed that this species follows a propagule-flux
model of dispersal (i.e. (re)colonisation of a previously
extinct or new vent site from the closest populations,
[22]). A hydrodynamic model predicts that effective
migration rates - accounting for A. pompejana’s larval
biology - cannot be maintained across vent fields if larvae travel more than 15-30 days in the water column
[12]. Nevertheless, using allozymes this species lacks any
clear genetic structure from latitudes 9°50’N to 21°N
despite a microgeographical population differentiation at
the scale of vent fields (i.e. tens of kilometres) [23].
These results suggest that the potential for larvae to disperse may be higher than previously thought provided
that no physical barrier to gene flow exists along the
ridge system [24]. Accordingly, Pradillon et al. [25]
reported an experiment where A. pompejana embryos
can arrest their development in cold water, potentially
delaying their metamorphosis during dispersal from
vents. To better explain the absence of isolation-by-distance in the northern EPR, three hypotheses have been
proposed: (1) allozymes lack the power to detect genetic
differentiation between populations; (2) balancing selection - due to the homogeneity of vent conditions along
the whole ridge system - maintains homogeneous allozyme frequencies; or (3) displacement of habitat patches
over geological times promote metapopulation
dynamics, thereby maintaining gene flow [24]. The first
hypothesis was tested by Audzijonyte and Vrijenhoek
[26] who suggested that undersampling biased some of
the previous analyses. The second hypothesis was supported by Piccino et al. [27] who observed balancing
selection on the phosphoglucomutase (PGM) locus with
one particularly thermostable allele being more frequent
in young populations. Interestingly, this study also
showed allele frequencies were homogenous at the
metapopulation scale, proving support for the third
hypothesis. The third hypothesis was tested by a model
which showed that bursts of colonisation events following the emergence of new vent sites along with population reconnections were sufficient to prevent genetic
differentiation between distant sites given limited dispersal of A. pompejana larvae [21]. The model predictions
were however, based on the possibility that new vent

sites could occur across physical barriers such as transform faults.
Recently, genetic divergence of nearly 1% was
observed at the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (mtCOI) gene between the northern and southern
EPR populations of A. pompejana [28,29], suggesting
the occurrence of an impermeable equatorial barrier to
gene flow. Furthermore, Plouviez et al. [29] demonstrated that this barrier affected most EPR vent fauna 1
to 2 Mya, giving credence to the role of transform faults
in provoking vicariant events between vent communities
and allopatric speciation. In the present study, an
extended analysis of allozyme and mtCOI haplotype distributions over the geographic range of the species,
including the southern EPR, was performed to better
address the ability of allozymes to detect genetic differentiation and to discriminate between the three hypotheses described above. Three additional nuclear genes,
including the PGM locus, were used to evaluate the
strength of this equatorial barrier to gene flow and to
test for potential secondary contact. We also attempted
to quantify migration and/or introgression rates between
the previously isolated northern and southern EPR
populations to disentangle the effects of selective and
demographic processes contributing to the genetic
break.

hexokinase-1 (HK, 2.7.1.1); and (3) Tris-citrate pH 6.7/6.3
(TC 6.7) for acid phosphatase (ACP, E.C. 3.1.3.2) and
isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH, E.C. 1.1.1.42).

Methods

DNA sequencing

Collection

Genomic DNA was extracted using a CTAB extraction
procedure following the protocol described in Plouviez
et al. [29]. A. pompejana mtCOI sequences from this previous study and the sequences of the outgroup A. caudata
were obtained with the ‘universal’ LCOI and HCOI primers [31] using the previously described sequencing protocol. Specific primers (additional file 1) were designed to
amplify partial exon-intron sequences of three nuclear
genes, either identified during transcriptome sequencing
(the S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHH) and globin
X (GlobX) genes [32]), or from the complete phosphoglucomutase gene sequence in A. pompejana previously
obtained using degenerate primers (D.J., unpublished
data). A non-synonymous change was discovered in exon
4 of PGM and specifically targeted in subsequent analyses.
Sizes of the DNA fragments and their exon-intron structures (boundaries) are given in additional file 2.
Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) and cloning were
performed using the mark-recapture (MR) method developed by Bierne et al. [33] with 4-nucleotide tails added to
the 5’ end of each primer. Each individual was amplified
by PCR separately with a different combination of
5’-tailed primers. PCR were conducted in a 25 μl volume
that included 1X buffer (supplied by manufacturer),
2 mM MgCl 2 , 0.05 mM (0.25 mM for PGM) of each
dNTP, 0.48 μM (0.4 μM for PGM) of each primer

Alvinella pompejana polychaetes were collected with the
manned submersible Nautile during two oceanographic
cruises in 1999 (HOPE) and 2002 (PHARE) at northern
EPR sites (Figure 1) and one cruise in 2004 (BIOSPEEDO) at southern EPR sites from latitudes 7°25’S to
21°33’S. Onboard (R/V L’Atalante), samples were measured at the fourth setigerous segment, sexed, and cut
in two: the cephalic portion was frozen immediately at 80°C for allozyme analyses and the body was preserved
in 95% ethanol for DNA analyses.
Allozyme genotyping

Allozymes, encoded by nine enzyme systems, were examined from seven hydrothermal vent field samples (Table 1),
following the protocols of Pasteur et al. [30]. Proteins from
each frozen gill tissue were extracted according to the
method in Piccino et al. [27]. Allozyme electrophoreses
were conducted on 12% starch gels using three different
buffer systems: (1) Tris-citrate pH 8.0 (TC 8.0) for phosphoglucomutase (PGM, E.C. 5.4.2.2), mannose phosphate
isomerase (MPI, E.C. 5.3.1.8), 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD, E.C. 1.1.1.44) and glucose phosphate
isomerase (GPI, E.C. 5.3.1.9); (2) Tris-HCl pH 8.5/8.2
(THCl 8.5) for triose phosphate isomerase (TPI, E.C.
5.3.1.1), leucine amino peptidase (LAP, 3.4.11.1) and

(additional file 1), 0.5 U of Taq polymerase (Thermoprime plus), 5 μl of template DNA and sterile H2O. Thermal cycling parameters used an initial denaturation step
at 94°C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles at 94°C for 30 s,
Ta for 20 s and 72°C for 2 min 30 s, before a final 10 min
extension at 72°C. As per the MR protocol, eight PCRproducts were pooled together per cloning experiment
with two cloning experiments per vent locality (16 individuals per sampled site). PCR products were isostochiometrically mixed, purified using QIAQuick™ columns,
and ligated into a pGEM-T vector (pGEM-T cloning kit,
Promega, Madison, WI, USA). For each cloning experiment, 32 positive clones were sequenced on both strands
at Genoscope (Evry) with universal plasmid primers (SP6
and T7), leading to a total number of approximately 3500
nuclear sequences. Sequences from all genes were proofread using CodonCode Aligner 2.0.6 http://www.codoncode.com/aligner/. Sequence alignments were initially
performed with ClustalW [34] in BioEdit version 6.0.6
[35] and adjusted manually. For nuclear genes, in vitro
recombinants between individuals from the same cloning
set were detected by their abnormal combination of 5’tails and removed from the dataset. Multiple recaptures
also allowed us to discard intra-individual in vitro recombinants (PCR recombination of heterozygous alleles) and
artefactual/somatic mutations.
Detecting a putative barrier to gene flow

Linkage disequilibrium between allozyme loci was examined for each locality and for the complete dataset using

Genetix version 4.05.2 [36] to detect redundant information. For each locality, allele frequencies were then
calculated for each locus and departures from HardyWeinberg equilibrium were estimated using the Weir
and Cockerham [37]’s estimator f and tested with 1000
permutations. To detect putative barriers to gene flow,
genetic differentiation was estimated along the EPR
from a multilocus Fst as calculated using Weir and
Cockerham’s θ [37], adding populations one at a time
from the most southern locality (21°33’S) to 13°N. At
each step, the F index was tested with 1000 permutations of the dataset. Exact G test was performed using
Genepop version 4.0.10 [38] for all populations.
Isolation-by-distance was tested along the whole EPR
using a Mantel Spearman test [39] with 5000 permutations
using Genepop version 4.0.10 [38]. Because previous studies [28,29] detected a barrier to gene flow across the Equator for the mtCOI marker, this test was also performed
without the 13°N population. To better understand population structure, the number of genetically-differentiated
groups (K) was evaluated using individual assignments to
these a priori groups based on their multilocus allozyme
genotypes from an admixture model with a 150 000 burnin length period followed by 50 000 MCMC repetitions.
The most appropriate number was obtained by testing K
values from 1 to 15 using the Structure program (version
2.2) [40]. Convergence of the Markov chain simulations
was checked for stationarity by monitoring ten iterations.
Average recapture rates were 0.60, 0.74 and 0.63 for
GlobX, SAHH and PGM genes, respectively. For all

Plouviez et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:220
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/220

statistical analyses based on recaptured sequences, one
consensus allele was randomly selected per individual to
avoid any putative bias due to the cloning method.
Allele diversity Hd, nucleotide diversity πN, and Watterson’s theta θW were estimated for northern and southern EPR sites separately with DNAsp 4.10.3 [41]. For
each gene, allele networks were constructed using Network 4.5.1.0 [42] to search for divergence across the
Equator (all recaptured alleles were used). Genetic differentiation indexes (øst) were computed using Arlequin
3.1 [43] from nucleotide sites by grouping populations
from either side of the Equator and departures from
zero (no differentiation) were tested using 1000
permutations.
Because most coalescent-based approaches impose
strong assumptions on the absence of recombination,
recombinants were detected by the Hudson and Kaplan
[44]’s four-gamete test, using DNAsp 4.10.3, and discarded
from the dataset for the IMa and Sweep_bott analyses.
Detection of gene flow between the two geographic
groups of A. pompejana using an isolation-with-migration
model

Population sizes, migration rates, and the time of population splitting were estimated using the isolation-withmigration model (IMa software, [45]) by grouping populations from each part of the geographical barrier (i.e. 9°
50’N and 13°N on one side and the remaining southern
populations on the other side). This model allowed us to
calculate posterior density probabilities of these three
parameters assuming that migration could still occur after
the splitting event of an ancestral population into two descendant populations. To check convergence of the Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with the true stationary distribution, multiple runs were performed using different
starting points and autocorrelation between parameter
values was assessed over the course of the runs. Upper
bounds of the uniform prior distributions used for the
final run were: q = 30 (prior population size parameters),
m = 1 (migration rates) and t = 2 (divergence time). A
swapping procedure was also used to enhance the mixing
of chains using a geometric heating scheme with 15 parallel chains. Inheritance scalars were assigned to 1 for
nuclear genes (autosomal) and 0.25 for mtCOI to adjust
for their expected population sizes. The HasegawaKishino-Yano model [46] was chosen to allow for multiple
substitutions at the same site.
To better estimate the date since the splitting event,
IMa parameters of divergence between populations (tIMa)
were converted into years. Because mutation rates have
not yet been estimated for alvinellid polychaetes, with the
exception of the mtCOI gene [47] which is known to
have a higher mutation rate compared to nuclear genes, a
geometric mean was derived from mtCOI, as well as

Page 5 of 15

PGM and SAHH for which a mutation rate has been
obtained from the hydrothermal vent gastropod Lepetodrilus fucensis across the Blanco transform fault [48] and
the hydrothermal vent mussels Bathymodiolus thermophilus across the Easter microplate [49], respectively. The
GlobX gene was not used because there is no adequate
calibration for its mutation rate. Before calculating the
geometric mean, an average mutation rate was assessed
per locus per generation accounting for different lengths
of the three genes (mtCOI 507 bp, PGM 940 bp, SAHH
531 bp), assuming one generation per year. The geometric mean U = 0.64 × 10 -6 , close to the value previously found using eight genes (mtCOI and 7 nuclear
genes, U = 0.63 × 10-6) on B. thermophilus [49], was then
used to recalibrate the divergence time from IMa to time
in years (T = tIMa /U).
Detecting putative ‘hybrids’ between the north and south
EPR using the PGM gene

Because substantial divergence has been observed between
the northern and southern EPR clades at the nuclear PGM
gene, fixed mutations were used to detect and locate
‘hybrids’ between these two geographic regions (heterozygous individuals with one allele from the northern clade
and one allele from the southern clade or individuals
sampled in a geographic region with alleles typical of the
clade of the other region). A restriction fragment length
polymorphism (RFLP) analysis combined with genotyping
insertion-deletions (indels) was performed to create a
composite PGM genotype for each individual. Among the
four clades observed, clade 3 displayed two restriction
sites for the RsaI enzyme whereas the three remaining
clades only had one. Clade 4 displayed two restrictions
sites for SspI whereas the three remaining clades have
three sites. Clades 1 and 2 differed by several fixed substitutions for which no restriction site was observed and the
presence of a 9 bp indel. RsaI and SspI digestions were
performed on PGM PCR products following manufacturer’s protocols and the presence/absence of the indel
was genotyped using new nested primers defined from
each side of the indel. Individuals were amplified in 15 μl
solutions that included 1X buffer (supplied by manufacturer), 1.25 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM each dNTP, 0.1 μM of
fluorescent-labelled (IRD700™) forward primer, 0.27 μM of
unlabelled forward primer, 0.33 μM of unlabelled reverse
primer (additional file 1), 0.5 U of Taq polymerase (Thermoprime plus), 4 μl of template DNA and sterile H2O.
Thermal cycling parameters used an initial denaturation at
94°C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles at 94°C for 30 s,
annealing temperature (Ta, see additional file 1) for 30 s
and 72°C for 25 s, before a final 10 min extension at 72°C.
PCR products were then electrophoresed on a denaturing
acrylamide 41 cm gel in a Li-Cor NEN Global IR2 DNA
analyzer.

Because gene genealogies contain information on demographic and/or selective events, neighbour-joining trees
(distances obtained by the maximum composite likelihood) were performed using Mega 4.0.2 [50], separately
on northern and southern EPR populations and rooted
with an A. caudata sequence for non-ambiguous portions of each gene. Departures from neutral expectations
were assessed by estimating Tajima (D, [51]), Fu and Li
(F*, [52]) and Fay and Wu (H, [53]) indexes in each
group of populations to test for putative demographic
and/or selective events. A multi-locus HKA test [54]
was computed for each group with one sequence of
A. caudata used as an outgroup using the HKA software
(J. Hey’s web page: http://lifesci.rutgers.edu/~heylab/
HeylabSoftware.htm#HKA). This test compares divergence and polymorphism at several loci to determine if
any loci display a departure from neutral evolution.
McDonald Kreitman tests (MK, [55]) were also performed to test for selection. We tested for the fit of
either a bottleneck or a selective sweep model for all
four loci (including mtCOI) in northern and southern
EPR populations (excluding introgressed alleles) using
Sweep_bott [56] with 100 000 first-step iterations, 1 000
000 second-step iterations and 20 optimisation processes
with a theta range from 1 to 30. This test compares
three distinct coalescent models (including a null constant-size model: M1) using likelihood ratio tests (LRTs)
and estimates whether the strength and the time since
bottleneck are sufficiently similar between loci to suggest a historical bottleneck (M2 model). If there is a
departure from the M1 model but no detected bottleneck, then the selective sweep model is considered as
more probable. A strong selective sweep at a single
locus can significantly reduce the fit to a bottleneck
model resulting in false rejection of a bottleneck hypothesis. To better discriminate the bottleneck and the
sweep models, departure from the M1 model was tested
individually for each locus (called M3 model). If all loci
showed a departure from M1 model, then a bottleneck
would occur even if the sweep model was found more
probable using the multilocus approach. If only a few
loci gave a departure from this model, then the bottleneck was ruled out and the selective sweep model
selected.

see: additional file 3), however most loci displayed only
one to 3 alleles at moderate frequency (> 5% in the total
population) and were shared among all populations. In
contrast, rare alleles were often private (additional
file 3). Common alleles reversed in frequency at the TPI
locus across the Equator, with the 13°N site showing
opposite trends in allele frequencies compared to the
7°25’S site (Figure 2). A similar result was observed at
the PGM locus but with a nearly complete replacement
of allele 100 by allele 78 and the frequency of allele 90
slightly decreasing from north to south. Significant heterozygote deficiencies (Fis > 0, see additional file 3)
were not linked to any particular locus and were not
systematically observed at any location. However, a
more detailed examination of Fis values at loci with two
or three common alleles indicated that the highest
values were found at 14°S and 17°25’S.
The multilocus estimate of Weir and Cockerham’s θ
[37] over all populations was not significantly different

significantly differed from zero with the Robertson and

method of Pritchard et al. [40] identified three genetically
distinct groups present in different proportions within
each vent field. The first group was primarily made up of
individuals from 13°N, whereas the second group clustered

DNA sequence variation among the three nuclear
genes (SAHH, GlobX and PGM) and mtCOI were analysed in the northern and southern populations of
A. pompejana across the Equator (Table 2, Genbank
accession numbers: HM183084-HM183493). As shown
by Plouviez et al. [29], the network of mtCOI haplotypes
displayed two reciprocally monophyletic clades (~1%
divergence) in the northern and southern EPR, respectively (Figure 3). Similarly, the PGM locus possessed two
sets of two divergent clades that were geographically
structured (average northern/southern EPR divergence =
0.76%): clades 1 and 2 were mainly found in the northern
EPR, whereas clades 3 and 4 were distributed in the
southern EPR (Figure 3). Populations from the northern
and southern EPR were significantly different from each
other at this locus (øst = 0.18, p < 0.01). Although populations appeared to be genetically differentiated across the
Equator at the GlobX locus (øst = 0.04, p < 0.05), these
populations were genetically homogeneous across regions
at the SAHH locus (øst value = 0.00, p > 0.05).

direction of migration when looking forward in time.
The magnitude of migration from the north to the
south (mn) and from the south to the north (ms) shows
that gene flow occurred predominantly from the north
to the south with no migration being detected in the
opposite direction (Figure 4B).
Single-locus estimates of migration also exhibited
asymmetry from the north to the south, although the
parameters for PGM, SAHH, and GlobX were not significantly different from zero on the basis of their 90% highest posterior density (HPD) interval. This was clearly
suggested by the allele networks for PGM and GlobX
(Figure 3) for which a few alleles from northern clades
were sampled in the southern EPR region. The mean
time of migration events from the north to the south ranged from 25 000 to 300 000 years ago (Table 3), indicating that introgression occurred well after the initial
isolation (~1.6 Mya) but not recently. The mean time of
migration events (mtime) at PGM was, however, ten
times lower than the two other loci suggesting more
recent introgression (~23 000 years) at this locus.
Detection of hybrids at PGM between northern and
southern populations

Testing an isolation model with migration between the
two geographic groups of A. pompejana

The isolation-with-migration (IM) model of Hey and
Nielsen [45] was used to test the occurrence of historical gene flow between northern and southern populations of A. pompejana or recent hybridisation and
introgression following secondary contact. The estimated IM parameters are presented in additional file 4.
Using all four genes, the split between the two groups
of populations showed the highest likelihood values at
divergence times of around 1-2 Mya (Figure 4A). IMa

looking from the present backward in time reversing the

Based on the PGM network (Figure 3), we detected three
individuals sampled on the southern EPR with at least one
allele from a northern clade (two from 14°S and one from
7°25’S), but with the southern mitochondrial type. Owing
to fixed substitutions and indels between the four
PGM clades, all individuals collected at these sites were
genotyped by combining RFLP and intron length polymorphisms. By comparing RFLP/indel genotypes and mitochondrial haplotypes of each individual, four ‘hybrids’
(33.3%) between the northern and southern groups were
detected at 7°25’S, two (16.7%) at 14°S and only one (1.7%)
at 13°N. No ‘hybrids’ were found at the other latitudes.

50’N and 13°N) and southern (7°25’S-21°33’S) EPR, respectively. Sizes of haplotype circles and lengths of connecting lines are proportional to the
number of sequences studied and the number of mutations that separate two linked haplotypes, respectively. Nuclear genes are rooted by a
consensus outgroup sequence of A. caudata (connecting line between A. pompejana and the A. caudata outgroup is not representative of
sequence differences due to the high number of mutations).

Detecting demographic changes and/or selective effects

Tajima (D) and Fu and Li (F*) indexes were significantly
negative for all loci in the south, but only SAHH displayed significant values in the north. All genes exhibited departures from neutral equilibrium between drift
and mutation in the southern EPR, but not in the northern EPR. Similarly, for each nuclear gene, Fay and Wu
tests were not significantly different from the neutral
expectation in the northern populations, but were significantly negative in the southern populations.
The PGM neighbour-joining tree displayed a topology
similar to a gene experiencing balancing selection (i.e.,
the maintenance of ‘old’ lineages), whereas trees from
the two other nuclear genes (SAHH and GlobX) had
more star-like topologies typical of a selective sweep
(Figure 5). The HKA multilocus test was significant

using all genes (probability from c2 distribution < 0.00),
indicating that at least one gene has experienced positive selection (or gene hitchhiking). After excluding
mtCOI, the HKA test became nonsignificant (p c 2 >
0.05), suggesting this gene could be experiencing strong
purifying selection or a sweep. However, McDonaldKreitman tests failed to reject neutral expectations at
any locus (p > 0.05) when comparing A. pompejana
polymorphism to the divergence of the A. caudata
outgroup.
The Sweep_bott analyses performed on northern and
southern groups of populations using the four loci are
summarised in Table 4. When the analysis was performed over all genes, LRTs indicated that the bottleneck (M2) and selective sweep (M3) models both
showed a significantly better fit with the dataset than

individually, LRTs for M3 were all significantly better
when compared with the M1 model for the southern
populations, suggesting that a bottleneck might have
occurred in this region. When the same analysis was
done on the northern populations, LRTs for M3 were
only significant for the SAHH gene, indicating that in
addition to a bottleneck this gene may have undergone
a selective sweep, at least in the northern populations.
In effect, the M2 and M3 models are not mutually
exclusive if a gene has experienced a moderate sweep in
a bottlenecked population.

Discussion
Emergence and strength of the equatorial barrier to
gene flow

A genetic break at the mtCOI gene between the northern and southern EPR populations has been identified in
previous studies by using a large number of hydrothermal vent species [28,29]. For some species, such as the
gastropod Lepetodrilus ovalis and the bivalve Bathymodiolus thermophilus, a clinal distribution of the northern
and southern mtCOI haplotypes was observed and
attributed to the occurrence of a secondary contact
zone between the northern and southern EPR [29]. In
contrast, A. pompejana exhibited a clear equatorial
break at this locus, raising the question of the permeability of this barrier to gene flow. The strength of the
break between the northern and southern populations
of A. pompejana appears to have significantly affected
both allozyme and nuclear loci despite the recent formation of the barrier. Although the SAHH gene exhibited
very little differentiation across this barrier, both the
GlobX and PGM loci displayed a clear geographic
separation of alleles. Divergence between northern and
southern clades was estimated at ~1-2 Mya using the
IMa multilocus estimation with very low migration
rates. This estimate is in agreement with the shared
vicariant event estimated at ~1.3 Mya from a series of
vent species using approximate Bayesian computation

on the mtCOI gene [29]. This isolation may be the consequence of the formation of multiple transform faults
~1-2 Mya in the region (Figure 1, [59-61]) reinforced by
a strong transverse deep-sea current at the Equator [62].
Slight, but significant differentiation at six allozyme
loci across the equatorial barrier indicates that 1-2 My
may not be sufficient to affect the net charge state of
allozymes to create divergence, but likely reduced migration rates enough to modify allozyme frequencies by
random genetic drift. This is particularly obvious in the
distributions of allozymes and RFLP variants at the
PGM locus (see Figure 6). Comparing patterns of
genetic differentiation between PGM allozymes and
DNA sequences indicated that allozymes are less sensitive at detecting the break. Moreover, the nearly complete replacement of the most frequent allele (100) in
the northern populations by allele 78 in the south suggested that genetic drift is the main force acting to separate these populations at this locus. This equatorial

break contrasts with the complete lack of genetic differentiation previously observed along thousands kilometres of vent fields on both sides of the EPR ([18],
along the southern EPR in the present study) and confirms that isolation-by-distance by itself is not a valid
argument to explain the observed decrease of gene flow
for A. pompejana. In the absence of physical barriers,
the species is able to disperse farther than expected
based on moderate inter-field distances and the high
bottom-current velocities [12]. This may be explained
by either a developmental arrest of embryos in cold
abyssal water masses and subsequent delay in metamorphosis [25], or the displacement of vent sites due to the
movement of hydrothermal activity along the ridge axis,
allowing bursts of colonisation by reconnecting previously isolated populations [21].
Questions addressing potential migration during an
ongoing allopatric isolation process may be explored in
two ways, depending on the primary cause for separation

of populations (transform faults or bottom water circulation): (1) is there a progressive isolation of the north and
south populations of A. pompejana by the offsetting of
ridge segments at the Equator? or (2) is there emergence
of a secondary contact between previously isolated populations due to the relaxation (i.e. attenuation of the transverse circulation) of the barrier?
Permeability of the barrier

Variation in the magnitude of the genetic differentiation
among loci has been widely reported during the process
of allopatric speciation [63] and is commonly detected
across barriers to gene flow [64-66]. This is mainly attributable to: (1) the sensitivity of the molecular method
used to detect polymorphism, which in turn depends on
the time scale at which the isolation is observed (i.e. the

accumulation of non-synonymous mutations that
change the net charge of a protein is a long process)
[67], (2) the stochasticity of the coalescence process
[68], and (3) the formation of a genetic barrier when
secondary contacts occur [9,49,69]. Fitting an isolationwith-migration model [45] between the northern and
southern EPR populations help to estimate both historical and contemporary migration and better understand
the role of the equatorial barrier on the isolation process. Even if the estimated migration rates were not significantly different from zero, the shape of the posterior
probability distribution of m n (north to south) was
shifted in comparison to ms (see Figure 4B) and suggests
that the barrier is porous. While migration was weak or
absent at mtCOI, all nuclear genes displayed an asymmetric number of migration events across the Equator
from north to south (Table 3), suggesting that allele
migration can occur between the northern and southern
groups. This was confirmed by detecting a few intermediate individuals at 7°25’S and 14°S between the
northern and southern PGM groups.
The fact that gene flow is virtually absent for at least two
loci (mtCOI and PGM) raises the question of whether the
barrier is becoming increasingly impermeable to dispersal
with time, or whether it represents a semi-permeable
genetic barrier following recent secondary contact. In the
first case, one can expect that most “migrating” alleles (i.e.
alleles typifying one lineage found in the other one) would
coalesce deeply in the evolutionary tree as they will represent incomplete lineage sorting. In the other case (emergence of a tension zone), all “migrating” alleles should
coalesce shortly in the coalescence tree, leading to very
low mtimes (times at which gene flow was maximum).
Mean times of migration at the three nuclear genes indicated that gene exchanges are probably not recent and
may have been maximal ~20 000 to 300 000 years ago and
support the hypothesis of incomplete lineage sorting and
ancestral variation [see [49,70]], favouring an increasingly
stronger barrier scenario. However, the high level of gene
flow heterogeneity across both nuclear and mitochondrial
loci favours the notion of a semi-permeable barrier to
gene flow as previously defined by Harrison [71]. Natural
selection is expected to prevent gene flow in regions of the
genome linked to genetic incompatibilities and to generate
interloci differences in migration rates [72]. To this extent,
the restriction of ‘hybrid’ individuals as estimated from the
PGM RFLP screening to a narrow zone located between
7°25’S-14°S could be indicative of the occurrence of a
genetic barrier with differential selection against hybrids
[69,73,74]. However, it may also simply reflect the fact that
very few individuals are able to cross the geographic barrier by chance maintaining low frequencies according to
the migration/drift equilibrium. Currently, the present
number of nuclear loci is too small to strongly indicate the

presence of a genetic barrier. Given that the vicariant
event was quite recent (1-2 Mya), genetic incompatibilities
and effective selection against hybrids may not have had
time to arise supporting a model of progressive isolation
of A. pompejana populations.
Demographic expansion in the southern EPR hypothesis
and evidence for a possible selective sweep at the SAHH
gene

A comparative phylogeographic approach involving seven
vent species using the mtCOI gene (including
A. pompejana) revealed the occurrence of a concomitant
demographic expansion in the southern EPR within the
last 0.5 My [29]. In the present study, southern populations (but not necessarily northern populations) displayed
significantly negative Tajima’s D and Fu and Li statistics
for all genes. Moreover, the bottleneck model (M2) was
significantly better than the constant-size model (M1) in
describing the genealogies associated with the southern
populations. Assuming a similar distribution of nucleotide diversity across the studied genes (as expected for a
demographic event such as expansion [54,56]), these
results are in agreement with an expansion of southern
populations, as hypothesised by Plouviez et al. [29]. Multiple extinction and recolonisation events possibly caused
by a higher rate of tectonic rearrangements and eruptive
phases in the southern EPR [75,76], would have favoured
the recurrence of bottlenecks through time as previously
seen from the long-term monitoring of targeted vent

fields since 1991 [77,78]. This also fits well with the drastic change of allozyme frequencies at the PGM locus on
each side of the barrier as genetic drift may be greatly
enhanced by recurrent bottlenecks and/or founder effects
[79,80]. However, IMa results provided a complete
reverse scenario (Figure 4C) suggesting that only the
northern populations increased in size since the population splitting. Although unexpected, this finding may be
due to several causes: (1) the very high proportion of
divergent allelic forms found in the northern populations,
a situation typifying an ‘old’ diversified lineage, (2) the
nearly equal sample sizes used in the analysis by suppressing both obvious recombinant alleles and randomlyselected alleles in the south, and (3) the possible nonneutral behaviour of at least one loci (i.e. the SAHH). The
two former explanations seem unlikely. In the first case,
the expectation would be an ancestral population size
nearly similar to that of the northern one. In the second
case, the Sweep_bott analysis (based on the same
sequence dataset) would have validated the bottleneck
scenario in the northern populations. The detection of a
bottleneck in the southern populations does not preclude
the possible additional effect of a selective sweep at any
specific locus. The SAHH locus was the only locus that
conformed to a selective sweep model on both sides of
the EPR with virtually no genetic differentiation across
the expected barrier, if an initial isolation step in allopatry is assumed. An advantageous allele (or a neutral allele
linked to a gene under selection by hitch-hiking) is more

Plouviez et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:220
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/220

likely to cross a genetic barrier and to spread within
populations of the recipient lineage if the allele is advantageous for both lineages (e.g. [81,82]). Analyses of
nucleotide polymorphism at this locus for northern and
southern populations of Alvinella caudata, the most closely-related and syntopic species to A. pompejana, indicated a clear fixed divergence of alleles across the
equatorial barrier analogous to divergences observed at
both the mtCOI and the PGM loci in A. pompejana (S.P.,
unpublished data). This suggests that the lack of lineage
sorting found in A. pompejana at the SAHH locus is
probably not the result of a slow evolutionary rate at this
locus but rather a case of high migration rate across the
barrier. The spread of an allele across a permeable barrier
is expected to be related to the magnitude of the selective
advantage [83], suggesting that the sweep may be recent
or very strong, even if the Fay and Wu test is only significantly negative in the southern EPR. Moreover, Faure et
al. [49] proposed that diversifying selection helped to
accelerate the evolution toward reciprocal monophyly at
this specific gene in the Atlantic deep-sea vent mussels,
suggesting that the SAHH gene may be indeed very sensitive to selection or linked to a potential positively
selected gene.

Conclusion
In summary, our multilocus study of A. pompejana
populations confirmed the presence of an equatorial
barrier, which plays an important role in structuring
populations of the species A. pompejana, as proposed by
Plouviez et al. [29]. This geographic barrier appears to
be still permeable to migration. However, low migration
rates that would occur primarily from north to south
may also indicate that the barrier is becoming more and
more impermeable suggesting that transform faults are
a likely mean to promote allopatric speciation along
oceanic ridges. In addition, discriminating a bottleneck
model from a selective sweep model through the comparison of mtCOI and nuclear genes strongly supports
the southern demographic expansion hypothesis previously suggested by a multispecies analysis using
mtCOI only. Combining multilocus and multispecies
analyses therefore allows us to propose that allopatry is
probably one of the major forces promoting speciation
and biodiversity within the vent fauna along the onedimensional framework of oceanic ridges.

Authors’ contributions
SP carried out sequence acquisition and RFLP/indel genotyping as well as
the molecular genetic analyses and drafted the manuscript. DLG genotyped
individuals using allozymes. OL annotated the cDNA library of A. pompejana.
FHL organised two of the three oceanographic cruises, helped sample
specimens and provided helpful elements of discussion. DJ designed the
study, carried out sampling, performed analyses with SP and edited the
manuscript. All authors have read and approved the final manuscript.
Authors’ information
This study is part of SP’s PhD thesis on the comparative phylogeography of
deep-sea hydrothermal vent species along the East Pacific Rise (EPR). Her
research involves multiple species and markers to examine speciation and
demographic processes along the EPR. DLG is lab technician in charge of
genotyping and biochemical analyses. OL works on comparative genomics
and bioinformatics. FHL has broad knowledge of vent ecology and has
spent most of his career working on the physiology of deep-sea
hydrothermal vent species. DJ is a population geneticist working on the
evolution and dispersal of deep-sea hydrothermal vent species. He has
recently developed a genomic approach to better understand the role of
gene adaptation in the evolution of vent species.
