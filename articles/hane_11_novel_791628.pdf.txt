A novel mode of chromosomal evolution peculiar
to filamentous Ascomycete fungi
James K Hane1,2, Thierry Rouxel3, Barbara J Howlett4, Gert HJ Kema5, Stephen B Goodwin6 and Richard P Oliver7*

Abstract
Background: Gene loss, inversions, translocations, and other chromosomal rearrangements vary among species,
resulting in different rates of structural genome evolution. Major chromosomal rearrangements are rare in most
eukaryotes, giving large regions with the same genes in the same order and orientation across species. These
regions of macrosynteny have been very useful for locating homologous genes in different species and to guide
the assembly of genome sequences. Previous analyses in the fungi have indicated that macrosynteny is rare;
instead, comparisons across species show no synteny or only microsyntenic regions encompassing usually five or
fewer genes. To test the hypothesis that chromosomal evolution is different in the fungi compared to other
eukaryotes, synteny was compared between species of the major fungal taxa.
Results: These analyses identified a novel form of evolution in which genes are conserved within homologous
chromosomes, but with randomized orders and orientations. This mode of evolution is designated mesosynteny, to
differentiate it from micro- and macrosynteny seen in other organisms. Mesosynteny is an alternative evolutionary
pathway very different from macrosyntenic conservation. Surprisingly, mesosynteny was not found in all fungal
groups. Instead, mesosynteny appears to be restricted to filamentous Ascomycetes and was most striking between
species in the Dothideomycetes.
Conclusions: The existence of mesosynteny between relatively distantly related Ascomycetes could be explained
by a high frequency of chromosomal inversions, but translocations must be extremely rare. The mechanism for this
phenomenon is not known, but presumably involves generation of frequent inversions during meiosis.

Background
The evolutionary history of organisms, as revealed by
comparisons of genome sequences, is of the greatest
biological significance and interest. The current explosion in the number of genome assemblies of species
within the same class, order and genus is allowing the
whole-genome interrelationships between organisms to
be examined in ever greater detail. There is a long history of comparisons of individual orthologous gene
sequences and these have revolutionized our understanding of phylogenetic relationships [1]. A more
complete understanding of both the mechanism and
results of evolution can be obtained by comparing
entire genomes [2]. These comparisons have refined
the concept of synteny. This term is used loosely by

many authors. Originally it was used in cytogenetics to
describe two or more loci that are located on the same
chromosome. As DNA sequencing and comparative
genomics became commonplace, the term synteny
acquired the additional property of co-linearity; i.e. the
conservation of gene order and orientation. In this
study we refer to synteny in the original cytogenetic
sense and describe co-linearity as a sub-category of
synteny. If orthologs of multiple genes that are colocated in the genome of one organism are co-located
in another species, the chromosomes on which the
genes reside are said to be syntenic. Synteny can also
be quantitative; chromosomes that contain all of the
same genes are 100% syntenic.
The process of speciation occurs when two independent populations diverge into reproductively isolated
species. Initially the daughter species would have had
chromosomes that shared both gene content (synteny)
and order (co-linearity). Over evolutionary time, the

degree of synteny and co-linearity would be degraded
through various processes, including chromosomal
duplications, gene losses/gains and chromosomal rearrangements (Additional file 1), until orthologous genes
in one species occur randomly in the genome of the
other.
The related concepts of synteny and co-linearity have
been refined mostly in plants, animals and bacteria. Synteny has been differentiated qualitatively based on the
length and completeness of co-linear regions. Macrosynteny describes co-linearity observable at a whole-chromosome scale, involving hundreds or thousands of
genes of which a backbone are co-linear. Microsynteny
describes co-linearity spanning a small number (for
example, two to ten) of successive genes. Comparisons
of vertebrate and flowering plant species within taxonomic families often have shown extensive macrosynteny [3-8]. Macrosynteny has been exploited to assist
genetic mapping and gene cloning; examples include the
use of the Arabidopsis genome to find genes in canola
[9], and rice/Brachypodium synteny to locate genes in
wheat and barley [10].

Order
Phaeosphaeria nodorum

Filamentous fungi form an ancient, large and diverse
group of organisms. Until the last decade, the phylogenetics of fungi was problematic but the application of
techniques based on gene sequence variation has created
a stable taxonomy. The ascomycete filamentous fungi
are mostly within the sub-phylum Pezizomycotina (Figure 1) [11]. This sub-phylum contains four major
classes: Dothideomycetes, Eurotiomycetes, Sordariomycetes and Leotiomycetes. The Dothideomycetes contains
more than 20,000 species amongst which are many of
the most important plant pathogens worldwide, including those in the genera Phaeosphaeria, Leptosphaeria
and Mycosphaerella.
Evolutionary diversity within the filamentous ascomycete fungi is much higher than in flowering plants or
vertebrate animals [12]. A number of reasons have been
proposed to account for this. Filamentous fungi reflect
approximately 400 million years of evolutionary history,
comparable to that of the vertebrates but approximately
four times longer than that of the flowering plants [13]
(Figure 1; Table 1). The generation times of fungi are
typically measured in hours or days, whereas plants and

Whole-genome synteny, indicated above the diagonal, was classified as either macrosynteny (macro), degraded macrosynteny (demacro), mesosynteny (meso), degraded mesosynteny (demeso) or no synteny
(none). âNAâ indicates lack of sufficient data to perform whole-genome comparisons. Time since divergence between orders, previously predicted within the Ascomycetes [38], is indicated below the diagonal

animals have generation times of many weeks, years or
even decades. Meiosis is a powerful force stabilising
chromosomal structure and may occur less commonly
in some fungi compared to plants and animals; whilst
nearly all filamentous fungi undergo germline asexual
reproduction, only a subset have known sexual phases.
Furthermore, many filamentous fungi can acquire
genetic material by lateral gene transfer, which can
increase their rate of evolution [14-16]. All of these factors would tend to reduce or eliminate the extent of
synteny between species. It was not surprising, therefore,
when initial comparisons between fungal genome
sequences failed to find extensive evidence of interspecific macro- or microsynteny [17-22] and, with the exception of the aspergilli, even between species from the
same genus [23-25].
The number of sequenced fungal genomes has
increased dramatically since 2008. There is now a sufficient number of sequenced species within each fungal
class to begin to assess whole-genome patterns of evolution. In this paper, we have applied a simple dot-plot
approach to fungal genome comparisons and observed a
striking pattern of chromosome-level evolutionary conservation. This pattern is characterized by the conservation of gene content in chromosomes, without
conservation of gene order or orientation; that is, synteny without co-linearity. We propose to call this
sequence conservation âmesosyntenyâ to distinguish it
from micro- and macrosynteny. Mesosynteny appears to
be peculiar to the filamentous Ascomycetes (syn. Pezizomycotina), particularly in the class Dothideomycetes.
This phenomenon has interesting implications for the
study of genome evolution and may have applications in
the sequencing and assembly of fungal genomes.

Results
Dot plots are a well-established method of representing
sequence comparisons [26]. Comparison of co-linear
genomes (Supplementary Figure S1a in Additional file 1)
gives a series of dots that lie on the diagonal (Supplementary Figure S1b in Additional file 1). Random gene
loss from either chromosome without major rearrangements (Supplementary Figure S1c, d in Additional file 1)
progressively destroys microsynteny but retains macrosynteny. Inversions are visualised on dot plots by diagonal lines with the opposite slope, while translocations
are indicated when the genes on a chromosome of one
species share syntenic blocks with two or more chromosomes. Conservation of short, contiguous runs of genes,
whether on the same or different chromosomes, retains
microsynteny but not macrosynteny.
The fungus Phaeosphaeria (syn. Stagonospora, Septoria) nodorum is a major pathogen of wheat [27]. It is
a member of the class Dothideomycetes (Figure 1), a

Page 4 of 16

taxon that includes more than 20,000 species amongst
which are many dominant crop pathogens [28]. Its
genome, which is believed to comprise 14 to 19 chromosomes [29], was assembled as 107 nuclear scaffolds
[21]. Expressed sequence tag and proteomic data have
refined the annotations to a set of 12,194 genes
[30-32]. Pathogenicity in P. nodorum has been linked
to the expression of a suite of necrotrophic effectors
[33-36] (formerly called host-specific toxins), some of
which appear to have been acquired by lateral gene
transfer [14,16].
The genome sequences of other Dothideomycetes species have become available recently, allowing whole-genome comparisons with relatively closely related taxa. We
used the software tool MUMmer [37] to generate dot
plots that compare the scaffolds of the P. nodorum
assembly with the 21 finished chromosomes of Mycosphaerella graminicola [38,39] (Figure 2a). These species
are classified respectively in the Pleosporales and the
Capnodiales, order-level taxa within the Dothideomycetes (Figure 2), with an estimated divergence time of
(very approximately) 300 million years ago (Mya). The
figure is arranged with the chromosomes or scaffolds of
each species arranged in size order along the axes. Dots
correspond to regions of sequence similarity and are
color-coded to indicate their degree of identity.
Our expectation was that we would see either dispersed diagonal lines or a completely random distribution of very short matches (âdotsâ). Instead, the dot plot
shows a highly non-random distribution whereby dots
from individual chromosomes of M. graminicola appear
to be strongly associated with one or a few scaffolds of
P. nodorum, indicated by âboxesâ within columns and
rows. For example, dots corresponding to P. nodorum
scaffold 7 were almost exclusively found within the box
corresponding to M. graminicola chromosome 12. Reciprocally, dots corresponding to M. graminicola chromosome 12 appeared predominantly within the box
corresponding to P. nodorum scaffold 7. The dots within
this box did not fall on any obvious diagonal lines and
were instead arranged quasi-randomly. When these two
sequences were aligned (Figure 2b), lines joining regions
of significant similarity were distributed quasi-randomly.
The orientation of the genes (color coded as red for parallel and blue for inverted) also appeared to be random.
The dot plots used six-frame back translations of the
genomes. Similar results were obtained with raw nucleotide sequences or when validated genes were used
(Additional file 2). This indicated that the majority of
the dots corresponded to genes.
We call this pattern of dots-within-boxes âmesosyntenyâ. The non-random distribution implies conservation
of the gene content of scaffolds (and by implication,
chromosomes) during evolution; hence, this is a form of

Taxonomic distribution of mesosynteny across the fungal
kingdom

To test the extent and generality of mesosynteny within
the fungi, the analysis was extended to other species

within the Dothideomycetes, other classes within the Pezizomycotina and other fungal phyla. These comparisons
were tested for chromosomal-scale genome conservation
and were classified as macrosyntenic, mesosyntenic, or
non-syntenic (Figure 3; Additional file 3).

determined to be syntenic at a whole-genome level, synteny was classified as âmesosyntenicâ or âmacrosyntenicâ based on the average length of
co-linear diagonals.

macrosynteny or mesosynteny. Quantifying the degree
of synteny between species required the development of
new statistical tests. Significant sequence conservation
was tested between pairs of scaffolds by a one-tailed
cumulative binomial test, requiring a probability of
â¥0.99. The whole-genome conservation was defined as
significant when â¥25% of the expected number of scaffold pairs (assuming perfect whole-genome synteny)
were conserved. Species pairs showing synteny were
classified as macro- or mesosynteny based on the average length of co-linear runs of sequence matches
between both genomes; an average co-linear diagonal
length of â¥20 kb was considered macrosyteny and < 20
kb was classified as mesosynteny (Additional file 3).
Mesosynteny and macrosynteny were further categorized
into âdegradedâ or ânon-degradedâ (Figure 3). Synteny
was classified as degraded when significant clusters of
âdotsâ or âlinesâ were found outside of the primary box
(that is, for any given âboxâ, < 75% of the total length of
conserved sequences within its corresponding rows and
columns resided within the dominant box). Scaffolds
shorter than 500 kb were excluded from these analyses.
Dot-plot comparisons between the Dothideomycetes
species P. nodorum, M. graminicola, Mycosphaerella
fijiensis and Leptosphaeria maculans showed significant
mesosynteny (Figure 4). The comparison between P.
nodorum and L. maculans (both in the order Pleosporales) was especially striking (Additional file 2). The dot
plot was dominated by matches of 80 to 100% similarity,
compared to 60 to 80% in the case of P. nodorum versus
the species in the Capnodiales, M. graminicola or M.
fijiensis. The dots in the comparison between P.
nodorum and L. maculans were almost exclusively
restricted to single boxes within both rows and columns.
As before, there was no indication of the diagonal lines
characteristic of macrosynteny. This pattern of nearly
exclusive dots within single boxes was also observed
when comparisons were made between these genomes
and the other released but so far unpublished Dothideomycetes genomes available via the JGI and Broad Institute web sites ([39,41,42] and data not shown).
Dothideomycetes species also showed a discernable
level of mesosynteny-like conservation with species
representing the classes Eurotiomycetes (Aspergillus
fumigatus), and the Leotiomycetes (Sclerotinia sclerotiorum; S. sclerotiorum sequencing project [43]), but not
with the Sordariomycetes (Magnaporthe oryzae) or the
Saccharomycetes (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (Figure 4;
Additional file 1). Comparisons of P. nodorum and M.
graminicola with A. fumigatus and S. sclerotiorum had a
statistically significant non-random distribution of dots
within boxes. In contrast to intra-Dothideomycetes
comparisons, dots appeared in multiple boxes within a
row and column. This is an example of degraded

Page 7 of 16

mesosynteny. Comparisons between Dothideomycetes
and M. oryzae (Sordariomycetes) and the yeast S. cerevisiae (Saccharomycetes) failed to find a statistically significant degree of synteny, reflected in the apparently
random distribution of dots. These comparisons had an
average of 1 and 0 sequences with binomial probabilities
of significant sequence conservation >0.99. No statistically significant syntenic relationships were found when
either M. oryzae or any yeast was compared with other
filamentous fungal genomes.
A similar series of dot-plot comparisons between the
class Eurotiomycetes and Leotiomycetes and species
from classes of the Ascomycota is shown in Figure 5.
The test species are A. fumigatus and S. sclerotiorum.
The comparisons between S. sclerotiorum and Botryotinia fuckeliana exhibited a highly conserved pattern with
many obvious diagonal lines made up of red and yellow
dots representing highly similar (90 to 100%) sequence
pairs. The average length of co-linear regions was much
greater than 20 kb. This is a classical macrosyntenic pattern reflecting very recent divergence between these closely related genera. A weaker macrosyntenic pattern was
observed between A. fumigatus and Penicillium marneffei, two species in the Eurotiales. Less than 25% of
matches in columns and rows resided within a single
box, characteristic of degraded macrosynteny. Comparisons between A. fumigatus and S. sclerotiorum and the
Dothideomycetes, represented by L. maculans, revealed
degraded mesosynteny. This was also observed between
S. sclerotiorum and the two members of the Eurotiales,
A. fumigatus and P. marneffei.
The Sordariomycetes Fusarium oxysporum exhibited
mixed patterns of synteny in comparisons between species from the related orders Sordariales and Hypocreales
and from other classes in the Pezizomycotina (Figure 6;
Additional file 4). Striking macrosynteny was observed
between chromosomes 1, 2, 4, 5 and 7 to 10 of F. oxysporum and chromosomes 1 to 6 and 7 to 10 of Nectria
haematococca. Parts of chromosomes 3, 6 and 11 to 14
of F. oxysporum exhibited a mesosyntenic pattern with
chromosomes 7 and 11 to 14 of N. haematococca.
Mesosynteny was strongest between N. haematococca
chromosome 14 and parts of F. oxysporum chromosomes 3, 6, 14 and 15. Degraded mesosynteny was
observed between F. oxysporum and Neurospora crassa,
S. sclerotiorum, A. fumigatus and with P. nodorum.
However, in all comparisons (excluding N. haematococca), dots were conspicuously absent from rows corresponding to F. oxysporum chromosomes 3, 6, 14 and 15
(Figure 6).
The comparison between N. crassa and Podospora
anserina (order Sordariales) showed a dominant pattern
of mesosynteny, with some macrosyntenic regions particularly between the largest chromosome of both species

between and within each order. This degrades into a mesosynteny-like pattern in comparisons between Dothideomycetes and the classes
Eurotiomycetes (A. fumigatus), Sordariomycetes (M. oryzae) and Leotiomycetes (S. sclerotiorum). Clustered blocks can still be observed in these
comparisons. The dot-plots comparing Dothideomycetes and Saccharomycetes (S. cerevisiae) appear to be random - that is, there was no
synteny.

Dothideomycetes exhibit degraded mesosynteny. Lack of synteny between the conditionally dispensable chromosomes 3, 6, 14 and 15 of F.
oxysporum (excluding N. haematococca) with chromosomes of any other species is evident by an absence of dots in those comparisons.

[20]. N. crassa exhibited degraded mesosynteny when
compared to S. sclerotiorum, A. fumigatus and P.
nodorum (Figure 6).
We expanded these comparisons beyond the classes
presented above to include additional species of the subphyla Saccharomycotina and Taphrinomycotina within
the phylum Ascomycota and species from the phyla Basidiomycota, Blastocladiomycota and Chytridiomycota
(Table 1; Figure 1). Non-filamentous Ascomycetes
(classes Saccharomycetes and Schizosaccharomycetes)
exhibited either macrosynteny or no synteny within their
respective classes and no synteny with other fungal
classes (Additional file 5). The class Agaricomycetes
exhibited degraded macrosynteny between species within
the class and no synteny with other fungal classes (Additional file 6). No non-Pezizomycotina taxa showed any
level of synteny when compared to species of a different
class (Table 1; Additional file 1).

Discussion
A novel and unexpected mode of chromosome-level
sequence conservation, which we have called mesosynteny, has been detected between species of filamentous
Ascomycetes, and in particular the Dothideomycetes.
Mesosynteny implies the conservation of gene content
within chromosomes but without conservation of gene
order or orientation. It contrasts markedly with the
macrosynteny observed commonly in plants and animals
and the absence of synteny seen in other eukaryotes
such as distantly related yeast species. The cause of
mesosyntenic chromosomal evolution is not known.
However, a mesosyntenic pattern would be expected to
occur if intra-chromosomal recombination (including
inversions) occurred significantly more frequently than
inter-chromosomal recombinational events such as
translocations.
Mesosynteny is distinct from macrosynteny. Macrosynteny would be expected to arise when the predominant modes of chromosomal evolution are interchromosomal recombination and gene loss. These considerations suggest that different patterns of mutagenic
events can lead either to mesosynteny or to macrosynteny as chromosomes evolve following a speciation
event.
Mesosynteny also is distinct from microsynteny, which
is characterized by co-linearity between clusters of two
to about ten genes with both order and orientation conserved. Earlier comparisons of synteny in related filamentous fungi frequently found clusters of genes with
related functions but without retention of gene order or
orientation. An example is the quinate cluster, which is
conserved across species of the Ascomycetes [21,44].
This pattern of shuffled cluster retention is akin to what
we observe at the whole-chromosome level.

Our results suggest that mesosyntenic chromosomal
conservation is restricted to the Pezizomycotina and is
most pronounced in the Dothideomycetes [45]. The
Dothideomycetes are the only group to exhibit nondegraded mesosynteny between species of the different
genera (estimated to have diverged approximately 120
to 150 Mya) and orders (approximately 300 Mya). A
recognizable yet degraded form of mesosynteny was
found between many species of Pezizomycotina outside
the Dothideomycetes. The estimated time of divergence within Dothideomycetes orders are comparable
to other orders within the Pezizomycotina that exhibited either degraded mesosynteny or no detectable synteny (Table 1) [38]. No mesosynteny was observed in
any of the fungal groups outside of the Pezizomycotina
that were surveyed: yeasts, Basidiomycetes, Blastocladiomycetes and Chytridiomycetes. The evolutionary
separation between these groups and the Dothideomycetes (500 to 650 Mya) [38] may be so great that both
mesosynteny and macrosynteny have decayed below
the limit of detection. To our knowledge, mesosynteny
has not been observed in non-fungal eukaryotes.
Superficially similar dot-plots have been occasionally
observed in comparisons of chordate genomes [45] but
appear to be due to the amplification of paralogous
copies of genes within chromosomes. Overall, either
macrosynteny or no synteny has been found outside
the Pezizomycotina.
Chromosomal conservation akin to mesosynteny had
been observed previously in a number of inter-species
comparisons within the Pezizomycotina, but its full
extent was not analyzed. These include comparisons
between the Pezizomycetes Tuber melanosporum and
the Eurotiomycetes Coccidioides immitus [46] and the
Sordariomycetes P. anserina and N. crassa [20]. As N.
crassa and P. anserina are heterothallic, the authors suggested that the observed conservation may be specific to
out-crossing (heterothallic) fungi. However, evidence
from this study suggests otherwise as mesosynteny was
observed between both heterothallic and homothallic
species (Table 1; Additional files 3 and 5). For example,
two homothallic Sordariomycetes species, which
diverged approximately 225 Mya [38], exhibited
degraded mesosynteny (Fusarium graminearum and
Chaetomium globosum; Additional file 7).
Mesosynteny was observed in species both with and
without (F. oxysporum [47] and Penicillium marneffei
[48]) a known sexual stage. It may be that sexual crossing has been lost relatively recently in these species.
Nonetheless, this finding suggests that mesosyntenic
relationships were not quickly lost in the absence of
meiosis. Amongst the mesosyntenic Pezizomycotina,
mesosynteny was weakest in comparisons against the M.
oryzae genome (Figures 5 and 6; Table 1). M. oryzae is

Hane et al. Genome Biology 2011, 12:R45
http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/5/R45

believed to exist in nature in purely asexual lineages.
The sequenced isolate of M. oryzae was a fertile derivative of two asexual lineages [19]. We speculate that a
history of asexual reproduction and/or the process of
laboratory domestication may have destroyed the remnants of mesosynteny in this isolate. This hypothesis
could be tested by comparisons with genome sequences
from additional isolates of M. oryzae or related species
in the Magnaporthales.
In some species there was an uneven distribution of
syntenic relationships between different chromosomes.
The genome of M. graminicola has been finished [39]
and comprises 21 chromosomes, the eight smallest of
which have been shown to be dispensable [49]. These
dispensable chromosomes displayed little sequence conservation with genes from any other species, and therefore no detectable synteny of any type (Figure 4). In
contrast, the M. graminicola core chromosomes exhibited a typical mesosyntenic pattern in most comparisons
with other Pezizomycotina species. Similarly, the conditionally dispensable chromosomes (CDCs) of F. oxysporum (3, 6, 14 and 15) showed no synteny with
almost all species tested. All of these supernumerary
chromosomes are thought to have originated by lateral
transfer from unknown donor species [39,50]. Whether
the lack of synteny of most supernumerary chromosomes is because they come from distantly related species or because they evolve more rapidly than core
chromosomes is not known.
Surprisingly, CDC 14 of N. haematococca was mesosyntenic to F. oxysporum CDCs (chromosome 14 and
the terminal end of chromosomes 3 and 6; Figure 6;
Additional file 4). This is in contrast to the core chromosomes of each species, which exhibited macrosynteny
and to previous comparisons that had indicated that
these CDCs were non-syntenic. A comparison of the F.
oxysporum genome with the closely related Fusarium
verticillioides indicated that the F. oxysporum CDCs
were not syntenic [50]. A possible explanation for this
phenomenon is that mutations and rearrangements in
supernumerary chromosomes accumulate more rapidly
because these chromosomes are rarely required for survival. Faster accumulation of mutations potentially
coupled with origins in distantly related donor species
may allow the sequences of supernumerary chromosomes to diverge to the point where no sequence similarity remains (as in M. graminicola). The occurrence of
mesosyntenic rearrangement in F. oxysporum and N.
haematococca may also be related to the origin of their
CDCs. These may have arisen in their common ancestor
from a single chromosome, which subsequently mutated
and broke into smaller chromosomes. Alternatively, they
may have been recently transferred laterally from a common (or closely related) donor.

Whole-genome shotgun sequencing involves the generation of many short DNA reads that are assembled
into longer segments. Macrosyntenic relationships are
commonly used to assist the assembly and finishing of
fragmented genome sequences, particularly in prokaryotic genomes. Sequences that are macrosyntenic to a long
sequence of a closely related genome can be confidently
hypothesized to be joined physically. Mesosynteny
between a new genome assembly with a reference genome also may be used to suggest which scaffolds are
juxtaposed. This could significantly reduce the cost and
complexity of assembling and finishing genomes. To test
whether mesosynteny could be used to predict scaffold
joins in genomic sequences, early and late assemblies of
the M. graminicola genome were analyzed to determine
whether the joining of contigs or scaffolds in the finished genome could have been predicted by mesosyntenic relationships of the draft genome to P. nodorum
[39]. Mesosynteny was remarkably successful in predicting separate scaffolds that should be joined and for
identifying mis-joins in the initial assembly. This
approach has the potential to assist with assembly and
finishing of other genomes within the Pezizomycotina.

Conclusions
We have unearthed a novel mode of evolution in which
chromosomes retain their content but shuffle the order
and orientation of genes. We propose to call this phenomenon mesosynteny. What is the origin and mechanism of mesosynteny? The phenomenon is observed only
in the Pezizomycotina and especially in the Dothideomycetes. The Dothideomycetes sequenced to date have
several (ten or more) relatively small chromosomes,
hinting at the ubiquity of supernumerary chromosomes
within this taxon. The Pezizomycotina exhibit repeatinduced point mutation and higher frequencies of lateral
gene transfer compared to other fungi [15,51]. Are these
phenomena causally related?
The mechanism for mesosynteny may occur through a
high frequency of inversions during meiosis. Whether
the Dothideomycetes have a higher propensity for inversions is not known but should be the subject of further
investigation. Alternatively, lateral gene transfer may be
the driving force behind mesosynteny. The mechanism
of lateral gene transfer is not well understood, but
recent evidence suggests that the sequence transferred
can be very large, even up to the size of entire chromosomes [49,52]. Fungi are capable of fusing with other
fungal species through either conidial or hyphal anastomosis tubes [53]. Fusion can lead to exchange of nuclei
and the transient formation of heterkaryotic strains. If
the transferred DNA carried a gene that was beneficial
to the recipient species, the chromosome (or a large section) carrying this gene may be retained whilst other

Hane et al. Genome Biology 2011, 12:R45
http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/5/R45

Page 13 of 16

donated chromosomes would be lost. As mesosynteny
tends to retain genes on the same chromosomes, a recipient species may be able to accept a substitute chromosome from a reasonably closely related species without
major disruption of phenotype. Recombination between
the new and old chromosome would shuffle the order
and orientation of genes, with remnant duplicated genes
being removed in further cycles of repeat-induced point
mutation. Recombinants with a complete core gene content plus any advantageous laterally transferred genes
would then be selected, resulting in the mesosyntenic
pattern of chromosomal conservation we see today.
Mesosynteny may, therefore, be an adaptive mechanism
that both allowed and resulted from lateral acquisition
of large chromosomal sections.

Materials and methods
Whole-genome comparisons

The synteny classification method is outlined in Figure
3. Genome sequence assemblies of the species listed in
Figure 1 were obtained from the sources described in
Additional file 1. Phylogenetic data (Figure 1; Table 1)
were inferred from previous publications [1,28,54,55].
Individual sequences (contigs, scaffolds or chromosomes) less than 500 kbp in length were discarded from
the analysis. Whole-genome comparisons were performed using promer (MUMmer 3.0, [37]) with the
ââmumâ parameter. Promer outputs were filtered for
repetitive matches using the program âdelta-filterâ
(MUMmer 3.0) with the â-gâ parameter. Genome dot
plots were generated using âmummerplotâ (MUMmer
3.0) and coordinates of promer matches were derived
from filtered promer outputs using the âshow-coordsâ
program (MUMmer 3.0).
Determination of significant sequence conservation

For the purposes of this study, only synteny observable
at a whole-genome level was considered. For a given
pair of genomes (genome A and genome B), all combinations of their sequence (contigs, scaffolds or chromosomes) pairs (one sequence from genome A (sequence
A) and one from genome B (sequence B)) were tested
for significant conservation. Lengths of conserved
regions in sequences A and B were derived from MUMmer outputs. The probability of synteny (P syn ) for
sequence pairs was calculated via a one-tailed cumulative binomial test:
x

psyn = F x, p, n =
i=0

n
i

p

i

1âp

nâ1

where x = (Length conserved in sequence A Ã Length
conserved in sequence B)/(Length of sequence A Ã
Length of sequence B); n = 100; p = (Total length

conserved in Genome A Ã Total length conserved in
Genome B)/(Total length genome A Ã Total length genome B). Psyn was required to be â¥ 0.99 to indicate significant amounts of sequence conservation between a
sequence pair.
Analysis of syntenic regions between conserved
sequences

The lengths of syntenic regions were analyzed for significantly conserved sequence pairs. Extended co-linearity
of sequence matches visible as uninterrupted diagonal
lines on a dot plot was used as an indicator of macrosynteny (Additional file 1). Dot plots between sequence
pairs were considered as individual scatter plots. Promer
matches between a pair of sequences were converted
into a series of points on the scatter plot, with a point
added every 1 kb along each match. R2 values were calculated along the axis of sequence A in 20-kb windows
(incrementing along by 2 kb). A window was considered
to be co-linear if it contained a minimum of 15 data
points with an R2 â¥ 0.9 The end coordinates of co-linear
windows were subsequently modified to exclude the
coordinate range of overlapping non-co-linear windows.
The data points of co-linear windows within 50 kb of
one another were combined (including intermediate
data points if not overlapping) and were merged into
larger co-linear windows if (Slope of window 1/Slope of
window 2) > 0.8 and < 1.2. The start and end points of
co-linear windows with a length of â¥ 5 kb were used as
the coordinates of âsyntenic regionsâ. The same process
was repeated along the axis of sequence B.
Classification of synteny type

Whole-genome synteny was identified by the âsignificant
pair ratioâ statistic, which is an indicator of the proportion of conserved sequences relative to the expected
number of conserved sequences. The significant pair
ratio was determined by:
Nscp
signiï¬cant pair ratio = â
Sa Ã Sb

where Nscp is the number of significantly conserved
pairs between genomes A and B; S a is the number of
sequences in genome A â¥ 500 kb; and Sb is the number
of sequences in genome B â¥ 500 kb.
Whole-genome synteny was identified when the significant pair ratio was â¥ 0.25. Genome pairs failing this criterion were classified as ânon-syntenicâ. Genome pairs
passing the test for whole-genome synteny were subcategorized as either macrosyntenic or mesosyntenic,
defined by an average length of syntenic regions (combined between both compared genomes) of greater than
or less than 20 kb, respectively. Synteny type was further

Hane et al. Genome Biology 2011, 12:R45
http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/5/R45

Page 14 of 16

categorized into âdegradedâ or ânon-degradedâ based on
the statistic âpair exclusivityâ. For a given sequence pair,
consisting of sequence A of genome A and sequence B
of genome B, the âpair exclusivityâ was calculated by:
Pair exclusivity =

Cab
CAb + CaB â Cab

where C ab is the total length of conserved matches
between sequences A and B; CAb is the total length of
conserved matches for sequence A and all sequences of
genome B; and C aB is the total length of conserved
matches for sequence B and all sequences of genome A.
Synteny was classified as âdegradedâ if the maximum
value of all pair exclusivities was less than 0.75.
