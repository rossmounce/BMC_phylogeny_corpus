Abstract
Background: Dermatological remedies make up at least one-third of the traditional
pharmacopoeia in southern Italy. The identification of folk remedies for the skin is important both
for the preservation of traditional medical knowledge and in the search for novel antimicrobial
agents in the treatment of skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI). Our goal is to document traditional
remedies from botanical, animal, mineral and industrial sources for the topical treatment of skin
ailments. In addition to SSTI remedies for humans, we also discuss certain ethnoveterinary
applications.
Methods: Field research was conducted in ten communities in the Vulture-Alto Bradano area of
the Basilicata province, southern Italy. We randomly sampled 112 interviewees, stratified by age
and gender. After obtaining prior informed consent, we collected data through semi-structured
interviews, participant-observation, and small focus groups techniques. Voucher specimens of all
cited botanic species were deposited at FTG and HLUC herbaria located in the US and Italy.
Results: We report the preparation and topical application of 116 remedies derived from 38 plant
species. Remedies are used to treat laceration, burn wound, wart, inflammation, rash, dental
abscess, furuncle, dermatitis, and other conditions. The pharmacopoeia also includes 49 animal
remedies derived from sources such as pigs, slugs, and humans. Ethnoveterinary medicine, which
incorporates both animal and plant derived remedies, is addressed. We also examine the recent
decline in knowledge regarding the dermatological pharmacopoeia.
Conclusion: The traditional dermatological pharmacopoeia of Vulture-Alto Bradano is based on
a dynamic folk medical construct of natural and spiritual illness and healing. Remedies are used to
treat more than 45 skin and soft tissue conditions of both humans and animals. Of the total 165
remedies reported, 110 have never before been published in the mainland southern Italian
ethnomedical literature.

Background
The folk-medical treatment of dermatological conditions
is prevalent in southern Italy and elsewhere. Dermatolog-

ical conditions are particularly common in rural agro-pastoral communities, where skin abrasions and small cuts
are regularly exposed to bacteria found in the soil and aniPage 1 of 10

mal faeces. At least one-third of all traditional remedies
used in the south Italian folk pharmacopoeia are directly
relevant to the skin.
Skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) caused by multidrugresistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), are an ever-increasing source of death
and high healthcare costs worldwide. In the US alone,
over 126,000 hospitalizations each year are due MRSA
infections [1]. Moreover, invasive MRSA infections affect
an estimated 94,360 individuals each year in the US and
are associated with approximately 18,650 deaths, exceeding mortality estimates for AIDs [2]. Natural products
from botanical sources used in traditional folk remedies
for the skin may offer a new route for combating multidrug-resistant bacterial infections through the elucidation
of biological compounds with novel mechanisms of
action. Furthermore, validation of traditional remedies
could rekindle community interest in preserving local traditional medical knowledge.
Ten communities in the Vulture-Alto Bradano area of the
Basilicata (historically known as Lucania) province were
the focus of this study. Basilicata, a region of southern
Italy bordering the Tyrrhenian and Ionian Seas, is divided
into two Provinces: Potenza and Matera. It is bounded by
the regions of Puglia (north and east), Calabria (south),
and Campania (west). The territory is roughly divided
into a mountainous western section, which is dominated
by the Appennino Lucano, an eastern section of wide valleys and low hills, and flat plains to the south along the
Ionian Sea.
Basilicata region covers 9,992 km2, and based on a 2001
census of The Italian National Statistical Institute (ISTAT),
Basilicata has a population of about 600,000. ISTAT also
reports that the Basilicata region has the lowest percentage
of urban population (17%, calculated in the period of
1997–1999), the highest life expectancy (75.7 years, calculated in the period 1991–1995), and presents the lowest utilization of allopathic medical services (23.9%
among men, 32.5% among women, calculated in 1997)
in all of Italy [3].
Basilicata has been influenced by historical immigration
flux from both Greece and Albania. Today, immigrants
come mainly from Eastern Europe or from Northern
Africa. The majority of recent immigrants into the smaller
communities, such as those included in this study, come
from Eastern Europe seeking work as housekeepers and
caretakers for the elderly, whereas North Africans typically
seek employment in the larger cities.
The Vulture-Alto Bradano area of northern Basilicata is
characterized by its proximity to the dormant volcano,

http://www.ethnobiomed.com/content/4/1/5

Monte Vulture (1,326 m.a.s.l.). The soil of this region is
particularly rich due to the presence of tuffaceous-clayeyvolcanic soil (produced by the explosive volcano ca.
830,000 years ago) and the local economy is founded in
large part on agriculture. Durum wheat, olives, and the
aglianico variety of grapes are the predominant crops.
Small-scale pastoral activity is also important, and goat
and sheep cheeses are produced locally. Regional industry, other than agriculture, is scarce, but some local artisans produce ceramics and a substantial portion of the
population between 20–45 years old are currently
employed in the Fiat automobile factory or other associated factories.
Based on data from historic ethnic Albanian communities
in the Vulture-Alto Bradano, traditional knowledge (TK)
related to household remedies corresponds with age and
gender. The likelihood of TK transmission is affected by
work patterns, which influences the amount of time an
individual spends in the natural environment performing
agricultural work. Women are the primary carriers of
knowledge for folk remedies, as well as the primary providers of household medicine. Older generations are
more knowledgeable of plant sources of both wild foods
and medicines [4-8]. Furthermore, because of the strong
link between TK and age, the level of TK in small communities is on a steep decline as the oldest generation dies.
This reflects a sense of urgency to record folk remedies,
which are normally passed down through oral tradition,
before they are lost forever.
In the past 50 years, only a few ethnobotanical studies
have been focused on Basilicata [4-14]. The aim of this
study is to collect ethnomedical data regarding the application of traditional remedies from botanical, animal,
and mineral sources for the topical treatment of the skin.
In addition to remedies for humans, we also discuss certain ethnoveterinary remedies that are particularly important for the care of livestock in the study area.
Socioeconomic dynamics are discussed in relation to the
transmission of knowledge for folk remedies across generations. Botanical species identified as components to traditional remedies for SSTIs in this study will be evaluated
for their potential in modifying MRSA growth and virulence in subsequent studies.

Methods
Field research was conducted in ten communities situated
in the Vulture-Alto Bradano area of Basilicata, Italy from
April-July of 2006 (Figure 1). Random sampling techniques were employed to recruit 112 interview subjects.
Interviewees were equally stratified by four age groups
(21–35, 36–50, 51–70, 71+ years) and gender in order to
compare TK levels across different generations. Prior
informed consent, as approved by the Florida Interna-

tional University Institutional Review Board (#12050501), was obtained before conducting interviews. We followed the ethical guidelines adopted by the ICE/International Society of Ethnobiology [15] and Italian
Association of Ethno-Anthropologists (AISEA) [16]. We
conducted interviews in Italian, took notes, and made
audio or video recordings of the interviewees when possible. Data was collected using semi-structured interviews,

participant observation, and focus groups. Interviewees
were questioned about the medicinal uses of the local
flora and fauna, particularly those related to the skin.
Demographic data regarding each community sampled in
the study is reported in Table 1.
All plants mentioned by interviewees were collected and
identified following the standard work of the Italian flora

[17]. Familial nomenclature follows the current
Angiosperm Phylogeny Group [18]. Voucher specimens
were deposited at the Università degli Studi della Basilicata
(HLUC) in Potenza, Italy and Fairchild Tropical Botanic
Gardens (FTG) in Miami, FL, USA. Bulk samples (100–
300 g per species) were collected for bioassays. Plant
materials were shipped to the USA under USDA permit
#DP63438.
The transcription of vernacular names of traditional remedies described in the local pharmacopoeia follows the
rules of the Italian language. The neutral centralized vowel
'schwa' of the southern Italian (Calabro-Neapolitanean)
dialect spoken in the studied area, often marked by some
linguists as (') has been denoted in this study with the
symbol "ē". The collected data have been compared with
all of the ethnobotanical studies conducted thus far in
mainland southern Italy, including Abruzzo, Molise,
Campania, Puglia, Calabria and Basilicata.
Statistical analyses of data, including calculation of mean
values and standard deviations, were calculated using
Microsoft Excel. Differences between means were analyzed with a one way ANOVA, followed by a series of 2sample t-tests on SPLUS software. Differences were considered significant with P-values < 0.05.

Results and Discussion
The folk medical construct
Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) are treated in different manners, depending on the perceived causation of the
illness. Illnesses with a naturalistic (biological) causation
are treated in a non-ritual context and involve the topical
application of either a plant, animal, mineral, or industrial product as the therapeutic agent. This is usually carried out by the individual being treated or by the female
head of household (mother or grandmother).

Illnesses of perceived spiritualistic causation are treated
much differently. Some manifestations of inflammation
on the skin, for example, are believed to be caused by
malevolent spirits, such as mal vjntē (wind illness) or fuoco
morto (dead fire illness). These cases are treated ritualistically, and a plant, animal, mineral, or industrial product
is employed strictly as a ritual object in the ceremony,
rather than as the therapeutic agent. Furthermore, the ritual treatment can be performed only by specific healers
(most of whom are women) who are recognized in the
community for their healing powers. The treatments for
south Italian spiritual illnesses in Basilicata have been discussed in previous publications [19-21].
Botanical remedies
We documented the topical application of 38 plant species from 27 families, comprising 116 distinct remedies

http://www.ethnobiomed.com/content/4/1/5

(Additional File 1). Plants are listed alphabetically by species. The vernacular and English names are also listed, as
well as the author citation of each species. Detailed information regarding the cultivation status, part(s) used,
preparation, application and popular use is provided. A
consensus index is included and is specific to each individual remedy cited. References to similar remedies in the
ethnomedical literature on mainland southern Italy are
noted.
Some of the more common uses of these remedies include
analgesic, vulnerary (especially for burn wounds), toothache, anti-inflammatory, anti-sting/anti-itch (for insect
bites), antiseptic (for lacerations), anti-furuncle, haemostatic, suppurative, emollient, and anti-abscess. Roughly
14% of plant-based remedies are applied for the treatment
of abscess and furuncle (Figure 2). Here we discuss three
of the most frequently cited plant remedies: common
mallow, white horehound and German chamomile.
Malva sylvestris (Malvaceae) – malva
Common mallow is a herbaceous species common
throughout most of Europe, except in the most northern
regions. It is one of the most important medicinal species
in the southern Italian folk pharmacopoeia. Its use as a
panacea is reinforced by a local saying, La malva, da ogni
mal' ti salva, (the common mallow saves you from every
disease). Common mallow is most often cited for its
restorative properties for cold, flu, and stomach-ache and
as a post-partum depurative [6,11]. In these cases, a decoction of the aerial parts is drunk.

It is also important in topical remedies for the treatment
of toothache due to dental abscess or decay, heat- and diaper- rash, bruise, furuncle, abscess, and mastitis. The
application of remedies from this plant to a number of
SSTIs, most of which are typically associated with bacterial
infection, suggests that this plant may exhibit antibacterial
properties and should be subjected to further study.
Marrubium vulgare (Lamiaceae) – maruggē
White horehound is a perennial herb native to Europe,
northern Africa, and temperate Asia. Much like common
mallow, white horehound is also an extremely important
species in the folk pharmacopoeia of southern Italy. It,
too, is considered a panacea and is associated with the following saying, A maruggē, ognē malē struggē (the white
horehound destroys every disease). In previous studies on
south Italian ethnopharmacology, the use of white horehound decoctions as an expectorant, hepatoprotective
agent, and cure-all has been described [6,7,11]. The Commission E monographs approve of white horehound use
for treating loss of appetite and dyspepsia [22].

A decoction of the aerial parts can be used as a rinse to
treat several important SSTIs, including general dermatitis, athlete's foot, furuncle, abscess, cyst, and wart in both
humans and animals. Investigation of the anti-MRSA
potential of this species and its phytochemical components could be promising.
Matricaria recutita (Asteraceae) – camomilla
German chamomile is best known for its anxiolytic and
sedative properties. In the Vulture-Alto Bradano, it is also
commonly used as a wash for skin conditions such as
rash, acne and dermatitis and also as an anti-conjunctivital eye-wash (Figure 3). Application of German chamomile decoctions for the treatment of eye inflammation
and infection has been broadly reported in Italy. German
chamomile has demonstrated in vitro anti-staphylococcal
activity [23] and has been found to promote wound healing in vivo [24]. The German Commission E has approved
the use of German chamomile in external applications for
the treatment of skin and mucous membrane inflamma-

tion, bacterial skin disease, and ano-genital inflammation
[22].
Zootherapy and remedies of mineral or industrial origin
The treatment of ailments with remedies made from animals and their products is known as zootherapy [25].
Since ancient times, zootherapy has been integral to the
traditional pharmacopoeias of many cultures [26-28].
Despite its prevalence in traditional medical practices
worldwide, the phenomenon of zootherapy has often
been neglected in comparison to the literature regarding
medicinal plant therapies. Animal-based remedies represent an important portion of traditional medicine practiced today in southern Italy. The sources of these
remedies include human, pig, bee, chicken, and slug
mucous.

Remedies of mineral and industrial origin are also important, and include sources such as copper sulphate, salt,
soot, and old gas, among others. They are employed in the

edies for skin conditions. In addition to its emollient
properties, it is also reported to be a useful vulnerary agent
in the treatment of both animals and humans. It is also
applied together with the leaves of Rubus ulmifolius to treat
furuncle, and to draw the pus out of purulent abscess. A
similar therapy with R. ulmifolius was reported in Campania, another area of southern Italy [29].
Garden slug
Therapies involving the slug Arion hortensis, locally known
as u' marruculē or lummachē senza guscio (snail without a
shell), has been briefly mentioned in previous work by
our group [11]. The most popular use of this gastropod is
to treat gastritis or stomach ulcer by swallowing it whole
and alive. A clear mucous produced by the slug is rubbed
onto the skin to treat dermatitis, inflammations, calluses,
and acne (Figure 4). The mucous is thought to promote
wound healing. In addition, a special ritual is incorporated in the treatment of wart. Mucous from a live slug is
first rubbed onto the wart, and then the slug is hung out
in the sunshine to dry out and die. It is believed that once
the slug has dried up, the wart should as well. A similar
remedy for wart involving mucous from an unidentified
snail is mentioned in Guarrera's work in Latium, Central
Italy [30]. This may, however, be a reference to the same
species of garden slug.

treatment of burn wound, furuncle, facial wrinkle,
abscess, broken bone, bruise, chapped skin, conjunctivitis, bronchitis, wart, acne, stomach ulcer, callus, cradlecap, and dermatitis.

Human breast milk
Human breast milk is a popular zootherapeutic remedy,
and is applied in the treatment of conjunctivitis, chapped
nipples, and cradle-cap. The topical application of breast
milk to infected eyes was cited by nearly one-third of the
interviewees. This remedy was also frequently cited during
a previous field study by our group in the Lucanian Dolomite region of Basilicata [11]. This use of breast milk may
be well-founded due to the antibacterial properties of xanthine oxidase and IgA antibodies found in the colostrum
and milk [31,32].

Forty-nine remedies from 30 animal, mineral, or industrial sources are used in topical applications (Additional
File 2). Remedy sources are listed alphabetically by English name. Vernacular names are also listed, along with
detailed information regarding the preparation, application and popular use of the remedy. A consensus index is
included and is specific to each remedy cited. References
to similar remedies in the ethnomedical literature on
mainland southern Italy are noted. Here, we discuss some
of the most unusual of these remedies, including aged pig
fat, garden slug and human breast milk.

aging the dorsal back fat of a pig in a cool dark place, such

Ethnoveterinary remedies
Ethnoveterinary practices have been reported on in Italy
in the regions of Basilicata [13], Calabria [33], Tuscany
[34], Romagna [35], Marche, Abruzzo, and Latium
[36,37]. Much of this data on Italian ethnoveterinary
medicine has been summarized in a useful database [38].

In Vulture-Alto Bradano, the topical application of traditional remedies to treat wounds and inflammation in livestock was particularly important in the smallest
communities surveyed, primarily in the localities of Montemarcone Alto, Sant'Andrea, and Pierno. Many families
in these communities are economically dependent on
agropastoral activities, and the health of their animals is a
central concern (Figure 5). Plant, animal, and mineral (or
industrial) derived remedies for ethnoveterinary applications are indicated with the symbol '♣' in Additional Files
1 and 2. Here, we briefly discuss two important sources of
ethnoveterinary treatments: copper sulphate and St.
John's Wort.
Copper sulphate
Copper (II) sulphate (verderammē) is a bright blue-green
mineral sold locally as a chemical fungicide for plants
(Figure 6). However, it is also one of the most frequently
cited traditional ethnoveterinary remedies. While it is also
used for the treatment of swollen feet in humans on occasion, the burning sensation it produces is a significant
detractor. It is prepared either as a ground powder, a mix-

ture with vinegar, or a mixture with water and salt and is
then applied to cracked hooves or to the chapped skin surrounding the hooves of livestock. This ethnoveterinary
remedy has also been reported in the western Basilicata
Dolomite mountain range [10].
Hypericum perforatum (Hypericaceae) – iperico
An oleolite made from an olive oil infusion of the aerial
parts of St. John's Wort (known locally as erva pē rē cuttē
or iperico) is massaged into the legs of horses and asses to
treat tendonitis. This remedy has also been described in
Tuscan ethnoveterinary practices [34]. In other studies,
oleolite preparations of the aerial parts or flowering tops
have been reported for wound healing and to restore skin
damaged by burns [36,39,40] or for treating mastitis in
milk-producing goats [29]. Oleolite preparations of a similar species, H. perfoliatum, have been reported in Sicily for
use as a disinfectant and to promote healing of burn
wounds [41]. The anti-staphylococcal properties of Hypericum species are well known [42-44] and are likely relevant to these traditional therapies.
Traditional knowledge: current trends and future
projections
The mean number of remedies quoted by interviewees is
reported by age group and gender (Figure 7). A generation
gap in knowledge regarding folk remedies for SSTI's was
evident. There is a statistically significant difference (p <
0.05) in knowledge of folk remedies for the skin between
the youngest subset of women sampled (21–35 years old)
and women 36 years and older. This may be explained by
recent shifts in the socioeconomic patterns of the region.
Prior to the opening of the Fiat automobile factory and all
of the associated parts factories in the region, women sel-

dom participated in the workforce. When the factories
opened nearly 15 years ago, a large shift in women's socioeconomic placement occurred. Young women entered
the workforce and no longer regularly participated in outdoor activities, such as upkeep of the family gardens and
vineyards, thus creating a significant gap between them
and nature. It also fractured the daily interaction with the
older women, who are the primary keepers of TK and
responsible for the oral passage to younger generations.
This socioeconomic shift, undoubtedly, played a significant role in the decline of passing TK on to this youngest
generation of women.
There was no significant difference between men in different age groups and men and women were roughly equivalent in oldest subsets sampled (51–70 and 71+ years
old). This lack of difference in TK for men may be
explained by historic emigration patterns. A large portion
of men from the oldest subsets sampled emigrated to
northern Italy and Switzerland in their youth for work.
Later in life, these men returned to the community of their
birth, but the substantial number of years away from their
native environment and traditions was detrimental to
their level of TK. In addition, younger men, like the young
women, did not acquire much TK due to dynamic of the
local economy.
Another pattern in TK levels related to the size of communities was notable. Younger men from the smaller communities (primarily the localities), who were actively
involved in agriculture – either in farming crops or pastoral activities, had much higher levels of TK for skin remedies than young men from larger, less isolated
communities. For example, one young shepherd from the
locality of Sant'Andrea was able to describe more than 40

remedies related to the skin. Young men who either
worked in factory jobs or were unemployed from a larger
community, like Ripacandida, could typically only cite 4
to 7 remedies. This reflects the importance of daily interaction with the environment and its role in the acquisition and retention of TK of plant derived remedies. A
qualitative analysis of the data also reflects a greater level
of TK retention and transmission between generations in
the smallest communities.
In summary, the likelihood of a continued decline in TK
transmission across generations is great and will be most
notable amongst women. Socioeconomic factors and
shifts in the dynamics of women's roles in the home have
perhaps the greatest influence on this paradigm. Stronger
dependence on allopathic, rather than traditional medical
care is expected in the coming years.

Conclusion
We identified 165 remedies derived from plant, animal,
mineral and industrial sources with particular relevance to
skin and soft tissue infection. Of the remedies reported,
110 have never before been published in the mainland
southern Italian ethnomedical literature. Moreover, some
of the botanical sources for SSTI remedies have never been
investigated for their antimicrobial properties and further
investigation of the phytochemical constituents of these
species is recommended.
Transfer of knowledge regarding household medicine is
declining, especially amongst women. These findings are
important because women have traditionally been the
keepers of knowledge regarding folk remedies and the
providers of household medicine. This loss of knowledge
is intrinsically linked with shifting socioeconomic
dynamics in the area and is not expected to be reversed.
This reinforces the importance of recording ethnomedical
and ethnobiological data now before it is lost with the
passing of the oldest generations.
