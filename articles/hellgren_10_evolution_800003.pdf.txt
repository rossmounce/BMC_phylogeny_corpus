Evolution of a cluster of innate immune genes
(b-defensins) along the ancestral lines of chicken
and zebra finch
Olof Hellgren1,2*, Robert Ekblom3,4

Abstract
Background: Avian b-defensins (AvBDs) represent a group of innate immune genes with broad antimicrobial
activity. Within the chicken genome, previous work identified 14 AvBDs in a cluster on chromosome three. The
release of a second bird genome, the zebra finch, allows us to study the comparative evolutionary history of these
gene clusters between from two species that shared a common ancestor about 100 million years ago.
Results: A phylogenetic analysis of the b-defensin gene clusters in the chicken and the zebra finch identified
several cases of gene duplication and gene loss along their ancestral lines. In the zebra finch genome a cluster of
22 AvBD genes were identified, all located within 125 Kbp on chromosome three. Ten of the 22 genes were found
to be highly conserved with orthologous genes in the chicken genome. The remaining 12 genes were all located
within a cluster of 58 Kbp and are suggested to be a result of recent gene duplication events that occurred after
the galliformes- passeriformes split (G-P split). Within the chicken genome, AvBD6 was found to be a duplication of
AvBD7, whereas the gene AvDB14 seems to have been lost along the ancestral line of the zebra finch. The
duplicated b-defensin genes have had a significantly higher accumulation of non-synonymous over synonymous
substitutions compared to the genes that have not undergone duplication since the G-P split. The expression
patterns of avian b-defensin genes seem to be well conserved between chicken and zebra finch.
Conclusion: The genomic comparisons of the b-defensins gene clusters of the chicken and zebra finch illuminate
the evolutionary history of this gene complex. Along their ancestral lines, several gene duplication events have
occurred in the passerine line after the galliformes-passeriformes split giving rise to 12 novel genes compared to a
single duplication event in the galliformes line. After the duplication events, the duplicated genes have been
subject to a relaxed selection pressure compared to the non-duplicated genes, thus supporting models of
evolution by gene duplication.

Background
Gene duplication has been an important factor for shaping the immune defence against the high diversity of
pathogens faced by vertebrates [1-4]. This can be seen
in the gene clusters of the major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) class I and II [2], but also in the innate
immune system in, for example, genes coding for toll[1] or anti microbial peptides, i.e. defensins [5].
Defensins are a group of small cationic peptides that
play an important role in the innate immune system of
vertebrates, as well as in invertebrates [6-8]. Defensins

provide a broad pathogenic defence against bacteria,
viruses, fungi as well as showing activity against protozoan parasites [9-11], primarily by binding to and disrupting the membrane of the invading organism.
However, recent studies have shown that they also
might play an important role in the link between other
parts of the immune system by signalling to macrophages, lymphocytes and mast cells [12,13]. Moreover,
the peptides might play a more complex role in destroying pathogens by not only disrupting cell membranes,
but also by being able to block viral infections by disrupting the replication cycle or altering host cell recognition sites [10,14]. Depending on the distribution of
sulphide bonds within the mature peptide, defensins can

be divided into three subfamilies; θ-, a- and b-defensin.
In the chicken genome, 14 genes coding for b-defensins
have been found in a dense cluster located on the end
of the 3 rd chromosome (3q3.5-q3.7, [15-17]). These
genes consist of four exons (E1-E4), E1 coding for
5’UTR, E2 the signal peptide and a part of the propiece
(i.e. the part of the prepeptide that is later cleaved off to
get the mature peptide), E3 codes for the rest of the
propiece and the mature peptide and the fourth exon
codes for the 3’-UTR. b-defensins are expressed and
excreted by neutrophils and epithelia cells lining various
organs [18-20]. In chicken, the tissue-specific pattern
seems to vary across the different defensin genes with
some showing expression in a wide array of tissues (e.g.
AvBD9 with found expression in 22 different tissues,
ranging from brain to different intestines and testis
[16]), whereas other seem to have more limited expression patterns (e.g. AvBD8 with expression only observed
in the liver and gall-bladder [16]). For complete summary, see [16]. Tissue specific patterns might however
be hard to fully understand, without experimental exposure to pathogens, as the genes as a group, seems to
vary in terms of having constitutive or induced expression patterns [21-24]. Constitutively expressed AvBDs
can potentially be observed in all tissues in which they
are active in, whereas AvBDs with induced expression
would only be observed when exposed by pathogens or
other external triggers, thus possibly biasing comparisons of tissue specificity between different AvBDs.
Evolutionary studies have shown that the formation of
defensin genes has been driven by ancient gene duplication events where, for example, all a-defensins are
thought to have evolved by gene duplication after the
bird-mammal split and the θ-defensins to have arisen in
the primate lineage, originating from the a-defensins
[17]. A comparison of b-defensin genes across distant
species (i.e. birds and mammals) yields weak phylogenetic signals of species [17], suggesting that many of
these genes have been duplicated and became defined in
function long before the bird-mammal split. However, a
comparison of more closely related mammal species has
yielded evidence of more recent gene duplications [25].
By comparing the chicken genome with a more closely
related species, the zebra finch, we investigated how bdefensin genes have been evolving since the G-P split in
the late Cretaceous period, i.e. about 100 million years
ago [26], in terms of duplication events, gene losses and
rates of evolution. More specifically, we tested whether
the gene cluster of b-defensins have been conserved
across the ancestral lineages of the birds species, and
the extent to which the avian b-defensin complex had
acquired novel genes through duplications along the
two ancestral lineages. We also tested whether duplicated zebra finch b-defensin genes where evolving

according to different selection pressures compared to
unduplicated genes and investigated tissue specific
expression patterns of this gene cluster using a digital
transcriptomic approach [27,28].

Results
Throughout the paper the nomenclature for avian
b-defensins (AvBDs) proposed by Lynn et al. (2007) is
used, where avian b-defensins (also known as gallinacins) found in the chicken formally named Gall1-14
have been renamed to AvBD1-14 [15]. Genes found in
the zebra finch that have ortholog chicken defensins are
numbered accordingly but with z as a suffix in order to
tell them apart and newly found genes without an
orthologous chicken gene named with a number greater
than 100.
The zebra finch genome contains at least 22 different
genes coding for b-defensins. All 22 genes cluster within
125 Kbp on the 3rd chromosome (figure 1, table 1). Ten
of these have an ortholog gene in the chicken genome.
In these cases the zebra finch genes were grouped
together, with a “sister gene” from the chicken genome,
with a posterior probability > 95% (Baysian phylogeny)
or a bootstrap value > 95 (neighbour-joining tree) (figure 2 and 3). Further support of the relationship
between the genes can be found when investigating the
gene location and order of the two sets of genes (figure
1) where the 10 orthologous genes have kept their
orientation and relative location in comparison to each
other on the chromosome. This suggests that these
genes have been duplicated long before the G-P split
and have thereafter been conserved along the ancestral
lineages of the two different bird species. In the case of
AvBD6 found in chicken, it seems to have originated by
a duplication of AvBD7 after the G-P split (figure 2 and
3), whereas the AvBD14 seem to have been lost in the
ancestral line of the zebra finch. The remaining 12
genes found in the zebra finch genome stem from two
ancestral genes, likely AvBD1 and AvBD3 based on the
phylogenetic relationship, which correspond to the physical location of the genes on the chromosome (figure 1,
2 and 3). The 12 unique zebra finch genes were all
found within a cluster located between gene AvBD2 and
AvBD5, the same location where AvBD1 and AvBD3 are
located in the chicken genome. The gene cluster can be
divided into two separate groups, one consisting of
AvBD123-AvBD125 (referred to as cluster A) that clustered together with AvBD1, and where all three genes
shared identical signal peptide (figure 2, 3 and 4). The
second cluster (cluster B) consists of 9 genes located
next to each other (AvBD115-122) on the chromosome
(figure 1) and clustered together in the phylogeny (figure
2, 3 and 4); these probably share an ancestral origin with
AvBD3. Five of the genes in cluster B share one type of

signal peptide, whereas two others (AvBD121 and 122)
share a signal peptide that differs by one amino acid
substitution (figure 2, 3 and 4). All other b-defensin
genes found in the zebra finch genome had unique signal peptides. Within cluster B two sets of genes are
likely to be the product of very recent gene duplication
events. The genes AvDB117a and b share identical
amino acid composition for signal and mature peptide
and differ only at the nucleotide level (including the signal and mature peptide sequences), with one synonymous substitution in the signal peptide and an
additional 21 SNP when including the intron, resulting
in a 3.6% difference along the full gene. The other case
is AvBD121 and 122 that differs at three different amino
acid positions in the mature peptide (figure 4) and has
three synonymous substitutions, two of which are in the
signal peptide. We can’t exclude that the case of
AvBD117a and b is a misassemble of two different
alleles or a case of gene copy variation, as seen in
human b-defensins [29]. However, that they do not map
next to each other (figure 1) together with the fairly
diverged intron reduces that chance. It would therefore
be of importance for future study to investigate the
occurrence of gene-copy variation, not only for
AvBD117 but also for the gene group as a whole.
Nine out of the 22 zebra finch b-defensin loci showed
evidence of expression in at least one out of six sampled
tissues (Table 2). A total number of 2,338 sequence
reads were mapped to one of these genes. Levels of
gene expression varied dramatically between the different loci with high expression levels in AvBD9 and
AvBD10 and low expression of the other seven. All

genes had high level of tissue specificity of gene expression (τ). The expression profile also varied between loci,
with AvBD8, AvBD9 and AvBD10 being expressed
mainly in liver and weakly in embryo, AvBD123 was
expressed exclusively in testes, while the rest of the loci
were expressed mainly in skin and/or spleen. None of
the genes had any detected expression in muscle.
The d N /d S ratio (ω) calculated pairwise over all
obtained genes together with chicken defensins showed
evidence of purifying selection, i.e. values of ω < 1
(mean dS = 1.59 S.E. = 0.03, mean dN = 0.54, S.E. =
0.01, mean ω = 0.67 S.E. = 0.01, figure 5). However,
looking at the distribution of the ω values in Figure 5
together with having a very deep phylogenetic tree (figure 2) indicate that the faster evolving non-synonymous
sites have become saturated, thus making comparisons
between paralog genes in the tree biased. For the following analysis we therefore only used pairwise comparisons between ortholog genes (i.e. for the same gene but
between species), or comparisons between recently
duplicated genes after the G-P split.
Pairwise comparisons between AvBD1/AvBD3 and its
duplicated homolog genes in the zebra finch genome
showed higher values of ω than comparisons between
orthologous chicken - zebra finch genes that had not
undergone duplication (mean ω = 0.53 (S.E. = 0.04) vs.
mean ω = 0.3 (S.E. = 0.05), Mann-Whitney U-test, Z =
-3.26, P < 0.001, Monte Carlo, test P < 0.001, Figure 6a).
Testing the rate between more recent and phylogenetically
more robust clusters of duplicated genes in the zebra finch
genome in relation to the rate of evolution of the unduplicated orthologous genes revealed an even bigger relaxation

only a few amino acid positions are responsible for the differences in antimicrobial properties of the peptide, positive
selection acting upon these specific sites might be might
be masked by negative selection acting on other sites that
keep the structure of the peptide.
Relaxed selection pressure might also have resulted
from those genes in the gene family having become

However, in no case were premature stop codons or
frame shifts observed in the investigated exons. Another
way to investigate whether the genes are still active
would be to test if genes originating from one of the
ancient genes still show evidence of positive selection
on specific amino acid sites and, if so, whether these
sites are corresponding to those of the “old active

genes.” Testing for specific sites under positive selection
(likelihood ratio test, LRT) showed that the best model
of selection for the cluster B data was model M8, i.e.
the model that allowed for certain amino acid positions
to be under positive selection (Table 3 and 4). Six
amino acids were found to have evolved under positive
selection in the zebra finch b-defensins (figure 4). The
methods of codon-based selection have been strongly

criticised lately [30,31]. However, in the case of b-defensins in the chicken genome the changes in amino acid
positions found to be under positive selection have proven to generate novel pathogen specific responses [32],
thus implying that the codons picked by the model do
represent sites under “true adaptive selection.” All
amino acids identified in our model (with one exception) have previously identified as being under positive
selection in chicken [15]. All of the selected amino acids
were located within the mature peptide. The probability
of the model to pick the 5 out of the 14 (the number of

positively selected sites in chicken) selected amino acids
over all variable sites in the signal and mature peptide is
lower than 0.01.

Discussion
Several of the genes included in the b-defensin cluster
of the chicken have been highly conserved both in the
zebra finch and in the chicken since they split around
100 million years ago. However, new avian b-defensin
genes have been acquired through duplications along
the two ancestral lineages, especially in the zebra finch

genome. After the duplications, the new genes have
evolved under relaxed purifying selection (although
some amino acids show evidence of positive selection)
compared to the non-duplicated genes.
The zebra finch genome contains a cluster of 22 bdefensin genes, of which ten were found to have orthologous genes in the chicken genome, originating from
ancient gene duplications before the G-P split. The
remaining 12 genes have evolved by a series of more

recent gene duplication events. The long branches and
low basal resolution in the phylogenies (figure 2 and 3)
suggests that the different orthologous genes have
occurred by ancient gene duplication events and then
been conserved along the evolutionary lineages of the
chicken and the zebra finch, i.e., in the region of 100
million years. That b-defensin genes arose by ancient
gene duplications has been suggested by earlier studies
[5,17,25]. The functions of the avian b-defensins in
chicken are increasingly well understood, both in terms
of where in the body they are being expressed but also
how effective they are against different pathogens (for
summary see [16,33]). The overall patterns of tissue specific expression of zebra finch AvBDs do coincide to
large extent to that found in chicken (for detailed comparison see van Dijk 2008 [16] and table 2). Similar to
chicken, AvBD2, 8, 9, and 10 was expressed in the liver,
AvBD9 and 10 in testis and skin, AvBD2 and9 in spleen.
The discrepancies are AvBD2 and 13 that in the zebra
finch that also was found to be expressed in the skin,
AvBD7 and 10 was additionally found in the spleen
(table 2).
Within a small region of 56 Kbp in the zebra finch
genome a series of more recent gene duplications have
occurred. Within this short physical distance on chromosome 3, there are two AvDB genes in the chicken
genome. These two genes have undergone several

duplication events and can now comprise 12 different
AvBD genes in the zebra finch genome. That these
duplicated genes have not lost their function is indicated
by several factors.
Firstly, our data on expressed genes together with a
similar study on expressed genes in the brain of zebra
finch [26] identify four or possible five of the duplicated
genes (with two and three expressed genes from each of
the duplication clusters). In this study, we identified the
genes AvBD123 (expressed in spleen) and 125
(expressed in the testis) that are a result of a duplication
event (Table 2). The third expressed gene belonging to
duplication cluster identified in this study was AvBD115
(also with expression in the spleen). AvBD115 was
together with AvBD117a/b also found to be expressed
in the separate study of [26]. In their study the
expressed sequence tag, FE7232851, was identical with
AvBD115 and ESTs, DV954612.1 and FE728335.1, are
likely alleles of AvBD 117a/b as it only differed by three
SNPs, two of which have caused nonsynonomous substitutions at position 34 and 56 (figure 4) changing Threonine (T) to Serine (S, both amino acids with uncharged
polar R groups) and FE728335.1 had an additional SNP
causing a nonsynonomous substitution on position 41
changing an Phenylalanine (F) to Tyrosine (Y). It should
be noted that a blast search of the EST against the
zebra finch genome yielded AvDB 117a and b as the
closest genes. A possible reason that some of the identified genes were not found to be expressed in the

investigated zebra finches could be due to tissue specific
expression in organs not investigated by us. In fact, in
chickens several of the b-defensins are expressed in tissues not evaluated in our study. These are manly tissues
associated with internal organs such as bursa, the intestines, lungs but also bone marrow and leucocytes [16].
Further, if no infection or immune response associated
with the investigated genes have been initiated then we
would not expect to see the gene being expressed.
Secondly, several of the genes share identical signal
peptides, although the mature peptides have evolved
new amino acid sequences (figure 2, 3 and 4). Thirdly,
within cluster B the amino acids under positive selection
(Table 3) are similar to the sites known to be under
selection in the functional chicken AvBD genes (Table 3
and figure 2 and 3, [34]).
Several models have been put forward about how new
genes and gene functions might arise through gene
duplication. Initial models (different versions of the neofunctionalization model) [35,36] suggested that after
duplication a gene is free from selection pressure and
can thereby accumulate mutations that could lead to
new functions. However, the main problem with these
models is that they do not explain why the original
(neutral) duplication is not lost by drift in the population [37,38]. If the original gene have evolved to conduct
more than one function then the two functions can be
divided between the two new genes thus escaping adaptive conflicts between the two functions (sub-functionalization models) [35,39,40]. Even here, the duplicated
genes are released from selection until one of the functions has been lost, although this time might be shorter
than in the neo-functionalization model, as in this case
mutations have to cause losses of a function, instead of
gaining new specialised ones [37]. However, a model
(the innovation, amplification, duplication, IAD model),
that maintains duplicated genes under continuous selection has recently been proposed by Bergthorsson and
co-workers [37]. First, innovation, in which the original

gene product has both a primary function and a secondary function which have neither deleterious nor beneficial properties. With a change in ecological niche, or for
immune genes, the encounter of a new pathogen fauna,
the secondary function becomes beneficial and an
increase of the activity is selected for. In the second
step, amplification, an increase of the secondary activity
is achieved by gene duplication and thus selected for.
Lastly, divergence, being freed from its original function
the duplicated gene can now evolve improvements in
what previously was a secondary function, thereby diverging from its original gene. In the present dataset there
are several indications that the IAD model might be
able to explain how the AvBD genes have duplicated
and diverged in the zebra finch genome, as discussed
below.
Individual AvBD genes have been shown to have
activity against several different groups of pathogens
[16,41]. The effectiveness against the different groups of
pathogens might, however, differ between the different
AvBD genes [41-43] thus depending on the environment
having primary and secondary function against different
pathogens. In two cases in the zebra finch genome very
recent events of gene duplication can be observed, in
one case the mature peptides are identical (i.e. AvBD117
a and b) and in the second case (AvBD121 and 122) the
mature peptide is highly similar. If having multiple
copies of an AvBD gene increases the gene expression,
as found when investigating gene-copy variation of
human b-defensins [29]. Then the effectiveness against
certain pathogens might increases simply due to an
increase in dosage, as seen in vitro [41]. Of interest
would be to investigate whether the expression of the
AvBD117 a and b is associated with an increased
expression, in relation to other single copy genes. Once
duplicated, the genes should start to diverge in order to
be optimized for the function that was formerly only a
secondary function. In the cluster of duplicated genes in
the zebra finch genome selection has been relaxed (Figure 6a and 6b), compared to the genes that have not
been duplicated. It should also be mentioned that in the
case of the more recent duplication event in the chicken
genome (AvBD6 and 7, figure 2) strong positive selection has acted upon the genes since the duplication
event (pairwise comparison, ML, ω = 1.8). As defensins
have been found to have broader functions such as signalling to the innate immune system [12,13,44], it might
also be that the diversification of the duplicated genes in
the zebra finch genome is associated with selection of
other functions than direct disruption of pathogen cell
membranes. In the chicken genome the expression patterns of the duplicated genes AvBD6 and 7 show similar
tissue expression pattern [16], suggesting that they have

Page 11 of 15

retained similar functions and both have kept strong
antimicrobial activity in vitro [16,43].
It can not be excluded that our finding that AvBD14
has been lost somewhere along the zebra finch lineage
is an artefact from a misassemble of the zebra finch genome. It may also be that our method for finding bdefensin genes was not general enough to find this gene.
Furthermore, AvBD14 is yet to be annotated in the
chicken genome (although the coding sequence for this
gene was deposited in GenBank in 2006 there is still no
publication describing the finding of this gene). However, an ortholog gene to AvBD 14 has been identified
in the Turkey genome indicating that the chicken
AvBD14 is not an assembly artefact (David Burt, pers.
comm.)
We have shown here, together with previous studies
on mammals and frogs, that antimicrobial peptides such
as b-defensins are evolving through gene duplication
and positive selection in vertebrates [45,46]. This stand
in contrast the counterpart of AMPs in the immune system in insects (i.e. Drosophila spp.) where studies several times failed to detect positive selection, although
duplications seems to have been common [47-49]. As
insects lack the adaptive immune system, selection
might work on other mechanisms that regulate the gene
expression instead of making the peptides more specific
[49]. To fully understand the different evolutionary pressures imposed on the immune system of different
organisms, we call for studies that examine not only the
selective forces acting upon the peptide itself but also
studies examining the selection on regulatory elements
associated with the peptide expression.
Studying the evolution of immune genes is associated
with additional challenges compared to other genes as
they might lose functionality by not evolving as pathogens constantly are evolving in order to evade the function of the immune genes. However, as shown in this
study, the steady increase in the availability of genomic
data makes comparative studies possible in order to
understand the underlying mechanisms of evolution and
diversification of genes in the immune system.

Conclusion
The genomic comparisons of the b-defensins gene clusters of the chicken and zebra finch illuminate the evolutionary history of this gene complex. Along their
ancestral lines several gene duplication events have
occurred in the passerine line after the galliformes-passeriformes split giving rise to 12 novel genes compared
to a single duplication event in the galliformes line.
After the duplication events the duplicated genes been
subject to a relaxed selection pressure, compared to the
non-duplicated genes.

Method
Identification of avian b-defensins in the zebra finch
genome

All known amino acid sequences from AvBD of the
mature peptide originating from the chicken genome
[15,17,50] were used to search the Taeniopygia_guttata3.2.4 (chromosomes) data base at http://genome.wustl.
edu/tools/blast/ for homologous amino acid sequences
using TBLASTN. All obtained amino acid sequences,
regardless of E-value and degree of homology, were kept
after the TBLASTN search. Each obtained hit was analysed by eye for the avian b-defensins characteristic
cysteine motifs (Xn-C-X4-6-C-X3-5-C-X9-10-C-X5-6-CCX n , where X x-x represent the number of amino acids
between the cysteines). All sequences containing this
characteristic motif were saved and considered as AvBD
candidates of the zebra finch genome. The corresponding nucleotide sequences were obtained from http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway based on the
nucleotide positions on the chromosomes. All data were
produced by the Genome Sequencing Centre at
Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis
and can be obtained from: http://genome.wustl.edu/pub/
organism/Other_Vertebrates/Taeniopygia_guttata/assembly/Taeniopygia_guttata-3.2.4/output/chromosomes/.
For each of the found mature peptide sequences, the
signal peptides (located in exon 2) could be identified
upstream within a maximum of 2500 bp; most were
found about 700 bp upstream. The signal peptides could
easily be identified due to high similarity to the corresponding signal peptides in the chicken genome. All
obtained gene locations and orientations were mapped
and compared with the AvBD cluster in the chicken
genome (figure 1). The different physical properties of
the peptides were calculated using the on-line calculator
at http://www.innovagen.se/custom-peptide-synthesis/
peptide-property-calculator (table 1). Nucleotide
sequence data reported are available in the Third Party
Annotation Section of the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank databases under the accession numbers TPA: BK006961BK006982.

liver (435,409 sequences), and skin (287,557 sequences)
tissue [51]. A total of 1,882,439 reads with a mean read
length of 83 base pairs (after trimming) were entered
into the assembly. Out of these, 741,917 were assembled
into 49,606 contigs while the rest were kept as singletons (for details about the assembly see Ekblom et al.
submitted manuscript). All reads are available in the
trace archive on the NCBI web site http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/Traces/home/. After having run a de-novo
assembly using reads from all six tissues together, reads
from each of the six tissues were assembled separately,
using the contigs from the first assembly as template.
The nucleotide sequences of the signal peptide and
the mature peptide, for each of the 22 annotated zebra
finch b-defensin genes, were blasted (stand alone blastn
version 2.2.18) against all contigs and singletons from
the assembly of the 454 data. Four contigs and 274 singletons gave significant (E < 1e-05) hits (additional file
1). For each of these, only the best (lowest E-value and
highest score) was extracted and run in a reciprocal
blast against the zebra finch genome sequence. All putative b-defensin contigs and singletons gave highly significant (E < 1e-09) best blast hits against the zebra finch
b-defensin gene cluster on chromosome 3 and the locus
for each of the sequences was inferred from the chromosome coordinates of the best blast hit.
For each locus, the number of reads in contigs and
singletons were counted for every tissue separately.
Number of transcripts per million (TPM) and index of
tissue specificity of gene expression (τ) [52] was calculated following the guidelines in [53]. Thus, the TPM
was set to 2 for tissues without any detected expression
for the gene in question and estimates of τ based on 3
or fewer reads in total were discarded. Theoretically τ
varies from 0 to 1, with low values indicating even
expression in all sampled tissues (house keeping genes),
and high values for genes expressed solely in one of the
tissues. Handling and analyses of blast results were performed in R version 2.7.2 [54].
Phylogenetic reconstruction and evolutionary analysis

Expression analysis of b-defensin genes

454 pyro-sequencing reads from cDNA libraries constructed using six different zebra finch tissues (embryo,
liver, muscle, skin, spleen and testes) were trimmed (for
adaptor sequences, SMART primers, poly-A tails and
low quality scores) and assembled using SeqMan NGgen
2.0 (DNASTAR, Inc). The cDNA libraries was pooled
from approximately six healthy individuals without
known pathogen exposure from the University of Sheffield population and contained cDNA from testis
(340,347 sequences), day-9-embryo (366,151 sequences),

The full sequences were concatenated to obtain the signal peptide and the mature peptide. The corresponding
amino acid sequences were then aligned using MUSCLE
[55]. Nucleotide sequences were aligned correspondingly
to the alignment of the amino acid sequences. Nucleotide sequences, together with chicken b-defensins
(AvBD1-14) were used for phyolgenetic reconstruction
in mrBayes 3.1.2. [56]. The run was partitioned to allow
for the signal and the mature peptide to have different
substitution rates and proportion of invariable sites. For
both the signal peptide and the mature peptide, the run

Hellgren and Ekblom Immunome Research 2010, 6:3
http://www.immunome-research.com/content/6/1/3

were allowed 6 different substitution rates and a gamma
distribution with a proportion of invariable sites (corresponding to the GTR+I+Γ model). Two simultaneous
runs were generated over 2000000 generations with a
sampling frequency of every 100th tree. Before analysis,
25% of the trees were discarded as burn-in period and
the remaining trees were used to construct a majority
consensus tree rooted on mid point. To get a second
validation of the phylogenetic reconstruction, a neighbour-joining tree was constructed using MEGA 4.0
bootstrapped 10000 times under a Maximum Composite
Likelihood Model [57]. Estimate of the branch length,
using an all sites analysis could give duplicated genes
proportional longer branches due to possible diversification events and difference in selection pressures on
selective sites. To get a phylogeny with branch lengths
that more represented the divergence time, we used the
topology obtained from the baysian phylogeny and
re-estimated the branch lengths using the dS matrix (i.e.
the divergence between two lineages only using the
synonymous sites) obtained from PAML [58](see below),
using the fich module in PHYLIP 3.69 [59]. The
obtained phylogeny was then imported into MEGA 4.0
[57] in order to compute a linearized tree that was
rooted on mid point (figure 3).
First, a pairwise comparisons of the rate of synonymous substitutions (dS) and non-synonymous substitutions (dN) were calculated between all sequences using
the method yn00 [60] as implemented in the software
package PAML 4.0 [58] to get an initial estimate of dS
and dNacross the whole tree. Values obtained by ML as
implemented in codonML in the software PAML 4 [58]
was used when comparing the dN/dS (ω) ratios within
phylogenetically robust clades (comparisons between
recently duplicated genes and orthologous genes
between the chicken and zebra finch). Two tests were
conducted to investigate whether duplicated genes
within the zebra finch genome have evolved under a different selection pressure compared to the homologous
genes that not have been duplicated since the G-P split.
First the ω values obtained by ML from the orthologous
genes outside cluster A and B (figure 2) were compared
with the ω value obtained between AvBD1 with the presumed related genes in cluster A and pairwise values
between AvBD3 and its presumed related genes in cluster B. Secondly, to ensure that no errors was due to
wrong phylogenetic relationships of AvBD1 and AvBD3
with the genes in cluster A and B, the same comparison
was done with the exception that only duplicated genes
grouped together with other intra-specific AvBD genes
within a group of genes that were supported by a posterior probability higher than 90 was included (figure 2).
The latter test gives an estimate of the mean ω after the
duplication events, in contrast to the initial test that

Page 13 of 15

would also include a period during which the gene
might have been evolving under stabilising selection
before the duplication events. The comparisons of mean
ω values were conducted using Mann-Whitney U tests
and a Monte Carlo simulation based on 1000 sampled
tables as implemented in SPSS 15.0.
CodeML in PAML [58] was used to investigate sites
under positive selection in a dataset containing the
genes found in cluster B in the zebra finch genome
without the ortholog chicken gene in order to only
include duplicated genes from one origin. If the whole
duplicated cluster is inactive, or contains only one active
gene, no positive selection should be observed. For this
reason, the basal chicken gene was excluded, because
otherwise the data set could potentially include two
active genes but still having all duplicated genes inactive.
Three different likelihood ratio tests (LRT) were conducted to investigate, which model of selection fitted
the data best. Likelihood values was calculated for the
following models (as recommended in the manual of
PAML 4.0): M1a, a model that assume nearly neutral
selection (i.e. ω = 1 or < 1), M2a (similar to M1a but
with positive selection allowed, i.e. ω > or < 1), M7 (a
more complex model of M1a with a b-distribution and ω
can vary between 0-1), M8 (a more complex model of
M2a with a b-distribution and ω that can obtain values >
or < than 1), M8a (similar to M8 but ωs = 1). The combination of LRTs where M1a vs. M2a, M7 vs.M8 and M8a
vs. M8. The models M2 and M8 calculate any sites under
positive selection with a 95% and 99% posterior probability using Bayes empirical Bayes (BEB).
