Abstract
Background: In recent years genome sequencing has been used to characterize new bacterial species, a method of
analysis available as a result of improved methodology and reduced cost. Included in a constantly expanding list of
Vibrio species are several that have been reclassified as novel members of the Vibrionaceae. The description of two
putative new Vibrio species, Vibrio sp. RC341 and Vibrio sp. RC586 for which we propose the names V. metecus and V.
parilis, respectively, previously characterized as non-toxigenic environmental variants of V. cholerae is presented in this
study.
Results: Based on results of whole-genome average nucleotide identity (ANI), average amino acid identity (AAI), rpoB
similarity, MLSA, and phylogenetic analysis, the new species are concluded to be phylogenetically closely related to V.
cholerae and V. mimicus. Vibrio sp. RC341 and Vibrio sp. RC586 demonstrate features characteristic of V. cholerae and V.
mimicus, respectively, on differential and selective media, but their genomes show a 12 to 15% divergence (88 to 85%
ANI and 92 to 91% AAI) compared to the sequences of V. cholerae and V. mimicus genomes (ANI <95% and AAI <96%
indicative of separate species). Vibrio sp. RC341 and Vibrio sp. RC586 share 2104 ORFs (59%) and 2058 ORFs (56%) with
the published core genome of V. cholerae and 2956 (82%) and 3048 ORFs (84%) with V. mimicus MB-451, respectively.
The novel species share 2926 ORFs with each other (81% Vibrio sp. RC341 and 81% Vibrio sp. RC586). Virulenceassociated factors and genomic islands of V. cholerae and V. mimicus, including VSP-I and II, were found in these
environmental Vibrio spp.
Conclusions: Results of this analysis demonstrate these two environmental vibrios, previously characterized as variant
V. cholerae strains, are new species which have evolved from ancestral lineages of the V. cholerae and V. mimicus clade.
The presence of conserved integration loci for genomic islands as well as evidence of horizontal gene transfer between
these two new species, V. cholerae, and V. mimicus suggests genomic islands and virulence factors are transferred
between these species.
Background
The genus Vibrio comprises a diverse group of gammaproteobacteria autochthonous to the marine, estuarine,
and freshwater environment. These bacteria play a role in
nutrient cycling, degrade hydrocarbons, and can be devastating pathogens for fish, shellfish, and mammals as
well as humans [1-5]. From 1981 to 2009, the number of
validly described species within the genus increased from

21 to more than 100 [6,7]. The most notorious, V. cholerae, is the etiological agent of the severe diarrheal disease cholera, endemic in southeast Asia for at least 1,000
years and the cause of seven pandemics since 1817.
Shown to be autochthonous to the aquatic environment
globally, more than 200 serogroups of V. cholerae have
been described. Epidemics of cholera are caused by V.
cholerae O1 and O139, with V. cholerae non-O1/nonO139 strains associated with sporadic cholera cases and
extraintestinal infections [8,9]. Cholera infections have
been ascribed to the presence and expression of virulence

genes, e.g., ctxA, tcpA, tcpP, and toxT [10,11], which are
also harbored by toxigenic strains of V. mimicus, a phylogenetic near-neighbor of V. cholerae. Genomic analyses of
V. cholerae and V. mimicus demonstrated significant similarity, suggesting horizontal exchange of virulence factors, such as CTXΦ and VPIs-1 and -2 [12]. Based on
results of phylogenetic analyses reported by Thompson et
al. [13], V. cholerae and V. mimicus should be assigned to
separate genera, a taxonomic assignment not yet
resolved.
The aims of this study were to describe the genomes of
two Vibrio strains previously characterized as variant V.
cholerae by culture-based and molecular methods
[14,15], and compare them to closely related Vibrio
genomes. Results of this study suggest these two strains
represent novel species and demonstrate evidence of horizontal gene transfer with their near-neighbors, V. cholerae and V. mimicus. We present here the genomic
characterization of two new Vibrio species, Vibrio sp.
RC341 (for which we propose the name Vibrio metecus)
and Vibrio sp. RC586 (for which we propose the name
Vibrio parilis), that share a close phylogenetic and
genomic relationship with V. cholerae and V. mimicus, but
are distinct species, based on comparative genomics,
average nucleotide identity (ANI), average amino acid
identity (AAI), multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA),
and phylogenetic analysis. Also, we present results of a
comparative genomic analysis of these two novel species
with 22 V. cholerae, two V. mimicus and one each of V.
vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus (see Additional file 1).
The new Vibrio species are characterized as Vibrio sp.
RC341 and Vibrio sp. RC586, sharing genes and mobile
genetic elements with V. cholerae and V. mimicus. These
data suggest that Vibrio sp. RC341 and Vibrio sp. RC586
may act as reservoirs of mobile genetic elements, including virulence islands, for V. cholerae and V. mimicus, Horizontal gene transfer among these bacteria enables
colonization of new niches in the environment, as well as
conferring virulence in the human host. Descriptions of
these species and definitions have been provided elsewhere [Haley et al., in preparation].

Results and Discussion
Strains

The two strains analyzed in this study, Vibrio sp. RC341
and Vibrio sp. RC586, were isolated from water samples
from the Chesapeake Bay, MD in 1998 and 1999, respectively. Vibrio sp. RC341 and Vibrio sp. RC586 were presumptively classified as variant V. cholerae [14,15], based
on similarity to the 16S ribosomal RNA of V. cholerae.
Vibrio sp. RC341 appears as yellow V. cholerae-like cells
and Vibrio sp. RC586 appears as green V. mimicus-like
cells on TCBS agar. Both strains were typeable with V.

and Vibrio sp. RC341 as serogroup O153 [14,15].
General Genome Overview

The genomes of Vibrio sp. RC341 and Vibrio sp. RC586
span 28 and 16 contigs, respectively, and putatively
encode 3574 and 3592 ORFs totaling 4,008,705 bp and
4,082,591 bp, respectively. Vibrio sp. RC341 encodes 91
RNAs, 71 of which are tRNAs. Vibrio sp. RC586 encodes
115 RNAs, 91 of which are tRNAs. The %GC content of
each genome is ca. 46%, while the %GC content of V.
cholerae strains is 47%. Vibrio sp. RC341 encodes 681
hypothetical proteins (19% of total ORFs) and Vibrio sp.
RC586 encodes 719 hypothetical proteins (19.6% of total
ORFs) determined by subsystem annotation. Twenty-four
of these hypothetical proteins of Vibrio sp. RC586 and 48
of Vibrio sp. RC341 showed no homology to any of the
sequences in the NCBI database.
Both genomes putatively encode two chromosomes,
determined by comparing both chromosomes of V. cholerae N16961 to draft genome sequences of Vibrio sp.
RC341 and Vibrio sp. RC586 using the MUMmer program [16] (see Additional files 2 and 3). The smaller chromosome of Vibrio sp. RC586 putatively encodes 1035
predicted ORFs, totaling approximately 1,155,676 bp. By
this method, 951 ORFs were detected in Vibrio sp. RC341
totaling 987,354 bp. The smaller size of the second chromosome of Vibrio sp. RC341 can be attributed to lowquality coverage of this genome or uncaptured gaps. Both
putative small chromosomes of the two species encode a
superintegron region homologous to that of V. cholerae.
The superintegron region of Vibrio sp. RC586 is ca. 93.6
kb, putatively encodes 96 ORFs, 66 (69%) of which are
hypothetical proteins and the superintegron region of
Vibrio sp. RC341 is ca. 68.6 kb, putatively encodes 66
ORFs, only 17 (26%) of which are hypothetical proteins.
Interestingly, the superintegron of Vibrio sp. RC341
encodes several membrane bound proteins suggesting
their role in the interaction with the extracellular environment.
Genome Comparisons

The genomes of Vibrio sp. RC341 and Vibrio sp. RC586
were compared with each other and to 22 V. cholerae, two
V. mimicus, one V. vulnificus and one V. parahaemolyticus genome sequences by pairwise reciprocal BLAST
analysis. Vibrio sp. RC341 and Vibrio sp. RC586 share
2104 non-duplicated ORFs (58% of the Vibrio sp. RC341
protein-coding genome) and 2058 non-duplicated ORFs
(57% of the Vibrio sp. RC586 protein-coding genome)
with 22 V. cholerae strains. Chun et al. [17] determined
that the current V. cholerae core contains 2432 ORFs,
indicating a dramatic difference in number of core genes
between Vibrio sp. RC341/RC586 and V. cholerae core

genomes. Vibrio sp. RC341 shares 2613 ORFs with V.
cholerae N16961 (73% of V. sp. RC341), and Vibrio sp.
RC586 shares 2581 ORFs with V. cholerae N16961 (71%
of Vibrio sp. RC586) (Figure 1). Vibrio sp. RC341 shares
2956 ORFs with V. mimicus MB-451 (82% of Vibrio sp.
RC341), and Vibrio sp. RC586 shares 3048 ORFs with V.
mimicus MB-451 (84% of Vibrio sp. RC586) (Figure 1).
Vibrio sp. RC341 and Vibrio sp. RC586 share 2926 ORFs
with each other (81% of ORFs in both genomes) (Figure
1).
To determine average nucleotide identity (ANI) and
average amino acid identity (AAI) between each genome,
the average pairwise similarity between ORFs conserved
between the compared genomes was calculated, following methods of Konstantinidis and Tiedje [18] and Konstantinidis et al. [19]. In this approach, two genomes with
an ANI >95% and AAI >96% belong to the same species,
while those with ANI and AAI below these thresholds,
comprise separate species [19,20]. The ANI and AAI
between Vibrio sp. RC586 and Vibrio sp. RC341 was 85
and 92%, respectively (see Additional files 4, 5, and 6).
The ANIs between Vibrio sp. RC586 and individual V.
cholerae ranged between 84 and 86%, while the ANI
between Vibrio sp. RC341 and V. cholerae ranged
between 85 and 86% (see Additional files 4, 5, and 6). The
AAIs between Vibrio sp. RC341 and individual V. cholerae genomes and Vibrio sp. RC341 and V. cholerae were
92% in all comparisons (data not shown). The ANIs
between Vibrio sp. RC586 and V. mimicus MB-451 and
VM223 were 88% and 87%, respectively, and 86% for
Vibrio sp. RC341 and both V. mimicus genomes (see
Additional files 4, 5, and 6). The AAI between Vibrio sp.
RC341 and V. mimicus strains MB-451 and VM223 was
92% in both comparisons, while the AAI between Vibrio
sp. RC586 and both V. mimicus strains was 93% (data not
shown).
The V. cholerae genomes had ANI >95% and AAI >96%
and both V. mimicus strains a 98% ANI and AAI. The
ANI for all V. cholerae and both V. mimicus strains was

86%. Based on these data, it is concluded that Vibrio sp.
RC341 and Vibrio sp. RC586 are, indeed, separate species, genetically distinct from V. mimicus and V. cholerae
and from each other. Strains of interspecies comparisons
shared <95% ANI and <96% AAI with members of other
species included in this study, the threshold for species
demarcation [19,20], as applied to Vibrio, Burkholderia,
Escherichia, Salmonella, and Shewanella spp. [21,19,22].
When Vibrio sp. RC341 and Vibrio sp. RC586 were compared with the more distantly related V. vulnificus and V.
parahaemolyticus, Vibrio sp. RC586 showed 72 and 72%
ANI and 73 and 73% AAI, respectively and Vibrio sp.
RC341 73 and 72% ANI and 73 and 73% AAI with V. vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus, respectively (see Additional files 4, 5, and 6). Furthermore, comparative analysis
of the rpoB sequence demonstrates that Vibrio sp. RC341
and Vibrio sp. RC586 have <97.7% sequence identity with
the rpoB sequences of all V. cholerae and V. mimicus
strains included in this study. In a comparative DNADNA hybridization and ANI analysis, Adékambi et al.
[23] demonstrated that rpoB <97.7% correlated with
DNA-DNA hybridization <70% and ANI <95%, both
being interpreted as demarcation thresholds for bacteria.
All V. cholerae strains included in this study showed
>99.5% rpoB sequence similarity with V. cholerae N16961
(data not shown). Based on a standard MLSA for the
Vibrionaceae [21], Vibrio sp. RC341 and Vibrio sp. RC586
both have <95% pair-wise similarity with V. cholerae, V.
mimicus, V. vulnificus, and V. parahaemolyticus strains.
All V. cholerae strains and both V. mimicus strains used in
this analysis demonstrated >95% similarity between concatenated genes of like-species (data not shown). Karlin's
dissimilarity signatures were also calculated between
these two genomes and the Vibrio genomes used in this
study. Vibrio sp. RC586 shared >10 dissimilarity with all
V. cholerae (11.5 to 16.2), V. vulnificus (19.6), and V. parahaemolyticus (41.6) genomes, and > 7 with both V. mimicus strains. Vibrio sp. RC341 shared >10 dissimilarity for
all V. cholerae (10.2 to 14) except V. cholerae B33 (9.4) and
TMA21 (9.8). Vibrio sp. RC341 shared >10 genome signature dissimilarity with V. parahaemolyticus (40.2), V. vulnificus (16.3), and both V. mimicus (>14) genomes. Vibrio
sp RC341 and RC586 shared a genomic dissimilarity of
8.7 with each other. Taken together these data indicate
that Vibrio sp. RC341 and Vibrio sp. RC586 are new species with a high genomic relatedness to V. cholerae and V.
mimicus.
Evolution of Vibrio sp. RC341 and Vibrio sp. RC586 Lineages

RC341, Vibrio sp. RC586, V. cholerae N16961, and V. mimicus MB451. The number in the middle shows the conserved number of ORFs
shared by the three strains. The numbers show that there are ORFs
unique to that strain or that there are ORFs shared.

The phylogenies of Vibrio sp. RC341 and Vibrio sp.
RC586 were inferred by constructing a supertree, using a
362,424 bp homologous alignment of V. cholerae, V. mimicus, and the new species (Figure 2). Based on the supertree analysis Vibrio sp. RC341 and Vibrio sp. RC586 are

deeply rooted in ancestral nodes, suggesting ancient evolution of the two species. Results of this phylogenetic
analysis suggest the Vibrio sp. RC341 lineage evolved
from a progenitor of the V. cholerae and V. mimicus lineages (Figure 2), a finding supported by strong bootstrap
support and further evidenced by the evolutionary distance of V. cholerae and V. mimicus from Vibrio sp.
RC341 (see Additional file 7). The two V. mimicus strains
are interspersed among V. cholerae, with respect to evolutionary distance, suggesting that evolutionary distances
of V. cholerae and V. mimicus are equidistant from Vibrio
sp. RC341 (see Additional file 7).
The phylogeny of Vibrio sp. RC586 suggests it evolved
from an ancestral member of the V. mimicus lineage after
the lineage evolved from a progenitor of V. mimicus/V.
cholerae (Figure 2). These iterations are supported by
strong bootstrap support calculations. A close evolutionary relationship for Vibrio sp. RC586 and V. mimicus is
also supported by shorter evolutionary distances between
the Vibrio sp. RC586 and V. mimicus strains (see Additional files 8 and 9). The evolutionary distance of all
genomes used in this study from V. cholerae BX 330286, a
putative progeny of the progenitor of the 7th pandemic
clade [17,24], is shown in Additional file 10.
Virulence Factors

Both Vibrio sp. RC586 and Vibrio sp. RC341 genomes
encode several virulence factors found in toxigenic and
non-toxigenic V. cholerae and V. mimicus. These include

Page 4 of 10

the toxR/toxS virulence regulators, multiple hemolysins
and lipases, VSP-I and II, and a type 6 secretion system.
Both VSP islands are also present in pathogenic strains of
the seventh pandemic clade [25]. Although neither
genome encodes CTXΦ phage, the major virulence factor
encoding the cholera toxin (CT) that is responsible for
the profuse secretory diarrhea caused by toxigenic V.
cholerae and V. mimicus, both genomes do have homologous sequences of the chromosomal attachment site for
this phage. Although these genomes do not encode TcpA,
the outer membrane protein that CTXΦ attaches to during its infection cycle and ToxT, involved in CTXΦ replication and activation, they do encode several other
mechanisms necessary for the complete CTXΦ life cycle
and both CT production and translocation, including
TolQRA, inner membrane proteins involved in CTXΦ
attachment to the cell, XerCD tyrosine recombinases,
which catalyze recombination between CTXΦ and the
host genome, LexA, involved in CTXΦ expression, and
EspD, involved in the secretion of the CTXΦ virion and
CT translocation into the extracellular environment.
Neither Vibrio sp. RC341 nor Vibrio sp. RC586 encode
VPI-1 or VPI-2, but Vibrio sp. RC341 encodes one copy
of both VSP-I (VCJ_003466-VCJ_003480) and VSP-II
(VCJ_000310 to VCJ_000324) and Vibrio sp. RC586
encodes one copy of VSP-I (VOA_002906-VOA_002918).
However, neither of these strains encodes complete VSP
islands, but rather variants of canonical VSP islands.
Incomplete VSP islands have been frequently found in
environmental V. cholerae and V. mimicus isolates [26]
[Taviani et al, unpublished].
The toxR/toxS virulence regulators, hemolysins,
lipases, and type 6 secretion system are present in all
pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains of V. cholerae and
both VSP islands are present in pathogenic strains of the
seventh pandemic. Presence of these virulence factors in
V. cholerae genomes sequenced to date, as well as their
divergence consistent with the conserved core of Vibrio
sp. RC341 and Vibrio sp. RC586, suggests that they comprise a portion of the backbone of many Vibrio species.
Their widespread occurrence suggests the ability of all
vibrios to be potential pathogens, but more likely, these
factors have an important role in their ecology.
Natural Competence

Analysis of the 22 V. cholerae genomes that have been
sequenced revealed the presence of type IV pili genes,
involved in natural transformation of Haemophilus spp.
and Neisseria spp. and other competent Bacteria [27,28].
Vibrio sp. RC341 and Vibrio sp. RC586 also encode this
system. Moreover, both species encode all 33 ORFs
described by Meibom et al. [29,30] that comprise the chitin utilization program for induction of natural competence. The presence of these systems in the two new

Haley et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:154
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/154

species and in V. cholerae indicates natural competence is
widely employed by vibrios to incorporate novel DNA
into their genomes and, thereby, enhance both adaption
to new environments and in evolution. Furthermore, the
well-established association of these bacteria with chitinous organisms and with high densities in biofilms [31]
supports the notion that natural competence and horizontal gene transfer are both highly expressed and common in vibrios.
Genomic Islands and Integration Loci for Exogenous DNA

Analysis of 23 complete and draft V. cholerae genomes by
Chun et al. [17] showed 73 putative genomic islands to be
present. By pairwise reciprocal comparison, the genomes
of Vibrio sp. RC341 and Vibrio sp. RC586 are concluded
to encode several of these genomic islands, as well as
many of the insertion loci of V. cholerae genomic islands
[17], indicating extensive horizontal transfer of genomic
islands. V. cholerae insertion loci are not specific to individual genomic islands, but can act as integration sites for
a variety of islands [17]. Vibrio sp. RC586 contains 33
putative GI insertion loci and Vibrio sp. RC341 contains
40 that are homologous to those found in V. cholerae. In
addition to having highly similar attachment sequences
and insertion loci, as found in V. cholerae, most of the
homologous tRNA sequences between Vibrio sp. RC341,
Vibrio sp. RC586, and V. cholerae are identical. However,
three glutamine-tRNA and one aspartate-tRNA sequence
of Vibrio sp. RC586 and four glutamine-tRNA and four
aspartate-tRNA sequences of Vibrio sp. RC341 show
between 99 and 97% similarity with homologous V. cholerae tRNA sequences. These sites serve as integration
loci for many pathogenicity islands. Interestingly, all
tRNA-Ser, the loci most commonly targeted by island
encoded integrases of mobile elements in V. cholerae [32],
were 100% similar between all strains. This high similarity of platforms serving to insert exogenous DNA suggests that the same or highly similar genomic islands are
readily shared. Sequences that are characteristic of GIs
and islets with homologous V. cholerae insertion loci and
putative function and annotations are described in Additional files 11, 12, and 13.
Vibrio sp. RC586 encodes eighteen sequences that are
characteristic of genomic islands and islets that are also
found in V. cholerae (see Additional file 12). Of these,
VSP-I, islet-2 and GIs-2, -4, -33, -34, -35, -41, -62, -64, 73, and Vibrio sp. RC586-GI-1 are located on the large
chromosome and islets-3 and 4, and GIs-9, -10, -20, and 61 are located on the small chromosome (see Additional
file 12). The VSP-I island is located at the homologous
insertion locus for VSP-I (VOA_002906-VOA_002918) in
V. cholerae strains, but is a variant of the canonical island
having a deletion in VC0175 (deoxycytidylate deaminase-

Page 5 of 10

related protein) and 90% sequence similarity to the
canonical island.
Vibrio sp. RC586 also encodes five sequences with
homology to the CTXΦ attachment site, with four of
them being tandemly arranged on the putative large
chromosome (VOA_000105-VOA_000126). At these loci
are four elements with high similarity (82 and 81% AAI)
to the RS1Φ phage-like elements (rstA1 and rstB1) of V.
cholerae SCE264 [33] and 97 to 100% nucleotide identity
to the RS1Φ-like elements in V. cholerae TMA21,
TM11079-80, VL426, and 623-39, reported by Chun et al.
[17] to be GI-33 (Figure 3). RS1Φ is a satellite phage
related to CTXΦ and assists in integration and replication of the CTXΦ [34,35]. However, these V. cholerae
strains were either CTXΦ-negative or encode a CTXΦ
on the other chromosome, while encoding sequences
with high similarity to rstA, and rstB of RS1Φ, RS1-type
sequences [33]. Immediately upstream of the rstA1-like
sequence is an hypothetical protein and immediately
downstream of this rstB1-like sequence is an hypothetical
protein with 52% identity with that of Colwellia psychrerythraea 34H, and a sequence with 99% similarity to
an end-repeat (ER) region and an intergenic region (ig) of
CTXΦ (Figure 3). This region may represent a novel
phage containing ORFs with similarity to the RS1Φ satellite phage and ER and ig-1 regions with high similarity to
CTXΦ. Absence of an integrase in this region suggests it
may integrate into the genome via XerCD tyrosine
recombinases, as does CTXΦ. All putative genomic
islands shared by V. cholerae and Vibrio sp. RC586 are
listed in Additional file 12.
Vibrio sp. RC341 putatively encodes 14 sequences that
are characteristic of genomic islands and islets that are
also found in V. cholerae (see Additional file 11). VSP-I
and -II and GIs-1 to 4, 33, and islets-1 to 5 are located on
the large chromosome, while GI-9 and 10 are located on
the small chromosome (see Additional file 11). These GIs
were described by Chun et al. [17] and two are single copies of VSP-I (VCJ_003466 to VCJ_003480) and VSP-II
(VCJ_000310 to VCJ_000324). Neither of the VSP islands
was present in their entirety, compared to 7th pandemic V.
cholerae strains. Similar to the VSP-I variant in Vibrio sp.
RC586, the variant in Vibrio sp. RC341 has a deletion of
VC0175. Also, ORFs VCJ_003468 to VCJ_003470 are
annotated as phage integrase, transposase, and phage
integrase, respectively. The homologous ORFs of this
VSP-I variant have a 92% sequence similarity to the
canonical VSP-I island. Interestingly, VSP-II variant of
Vibrio sp. RC341 contains a 10 kb putative phage encoding a type 1 restriction modification system, has a %GC of
ca. 38%, and is located at the homologous insertion locus
of GI-56 in V. cholerae (tRNA-Met) (Figure 4). This phage
shares significant similarity with V. vulnificus YJ016

Figure 3 RS1Φ-like elements located at CTXΦ attachment sites on the large chromosomes of Vibrio sp. RC586 and Vibrio sp. RC341 and the
canonical RS1Φ of V. cholerae. SHK = sensor histidine kinase, HP = hypothetical protein, ER = end repeat, ig = intergenic region.

Several variants of VSP-II are encoded in multiple strains
of V. cholerae [E. Taviani, unpublished]. However, the
variant encoded in Vibrio sp. RC341 is, to date, unique.
Interestingly, Vibrio sp. RC341 encodes V. cholerae GI33, a ca. 2615 bp region, (VCJ_001870 to VCJ_001874)
similar to RS1Φ-like phage in Vibrio sp. RC586, V. cholerae strains VL426, SCE264, TMA21, TM11079-80, and
623-39, showing 93 to 96% nucleotide sequence similarity

across 67 to 79% of the phage (Figure 3). This region in
Vibrio sp. RC341 encodes only the rstA1 and rstB1 and
the 3' hypothetical protein flanked by CTXΦ-like end
repeats and an intergenic region, inserted at the homologous CTXΦ attachment site on chromosome I (Figure 3).
Analysis of this and similar phages inserting at this locus
suggests an extremely high diversity of vibriophages in
both structure and sequence in the environment. Putative

genomic islands shared by V. cholerae and Vibrio sp.
RC341 are listed in Additional file 11.
Horizontal Gene Transfer of Genomic Islands

Homologous genomic islands typically showed higher
ANI between strains than the conserved backbone
regions of these genomes, an indication of recent transfer
of these islands among the same and different species. All
GIs shared by Vibrio sp. RC586 and V. cholerae strains
were 87 to 100% ANI%, with the exception of two GIs
with 77% (GI-9) and 82% (GI-62) ANI (see Additional
files 12 and 13). All GIs among Vibrio sp. RC341 and V.
cholerae had 87 to 99% ANI, excluding three GIs with 81
to 82% (GIs-3, 9, and 2), and two with and 85% (GI-1,
Vibrio sp. RC341 islets -1 and -2) (see Additional files 11
and 13).
Phylogenetic analysis using homologous ORFs of the
genomic islands yielded evidence of recent lateral transfer
of VSP-I, and GIs-2, 41, and 61 among V. cholerae and
Vibrio sp. RC586. In all cases, phylogenies inferred by the
ORFs were incongruent with species phylogeny, suggesting the elements were transferred after the species
diverged (see Additional files 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18).
Using the same methods, we found evidence of recent lateral transfer of VSP-I, GI-4, and islet-3, between V. cholerae and Vibrio sp. RC341. In all cases, phylogenies
inferred by the ORFs were incongruent with species phylogeny (see Additional files 16, 17, and 19). Our data suggests that V. cholerae VL426 (V. cholerae biotype albensis)
received a VSP-I similar to that of Vibrio sp. RC341 and
Vibrio sp. RC586 via horizontal gene transfer. We also
found evidence of horizontal transfer of V. cholerae GI-2
from V. cholerae to Vibrio sp. RC586, as well as Vibrio sp.
RC341 Islet-3 and V. cholerae GI-4 from Vibrio sp. RC341
to V. cholerae strains.
VSP-II, islets-2, -4, -5, and GIs-1, -2, -3, -9, -10, all present in at least one V. cholerae genome and in Vibrio sp.
RC341, showed no evidence of horizontal gene transfer.
Most likely there are many undescribed variants of these
elements, in both structure and nucleotide sequence, yet
to be found in the natural environment, with certain variants more frequently transferred among strains of the
same species. Coevolution of the island and host genome
over time no doubt occurs. In any case, based on the data
reported here V. cholerae is not alone in propagating
these elements. They surely cycle among different but
closely related species in the environment.
Unique Genomic Islands

Vibrio sp. RC586 putatively encodes five unique genomic
islands and islets not yet reported for V. cholerae (see
Additional files 12 and 13). Vibrio sp. RC586 GI-2 and
islet-5 encode phage-like elements. Interestingly, islet-5 is
annotated as probable coat protein A precursor, with

Page 7 of 10

similarity to bacteriophage f237 ORF5 of V. campbellii
and zona occludens toxin (zot), with high similarity to V.
parahaemolyticus and V. harveyi zot (VOA_001598VOA_001600). This phage-like element is inserted at the
homologous locus for V. cholerae O1 Classical CTXΦ
insertion (VCA0569-VCA0570). Vibrio sp. RC586 GI-4
encodes sequences homologous to the Tn7 transposition
tnsABCDE, a transposon known to integrate into phylogenetically diverse organisms and form genomic islands
[36]. Vibrio sp. RC586 GIs-1, -3, -4, and islets-1 through 6
all share homologous insertion loci with previously
described V. cholerae GIs (see Additional file 12).
Vibrio sp. RC341 encodes six putative unique genomic
islands not reported before (see Additional files 11 and
13). Vibrio sp. RC341 GIs-1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 all encode
phage-like/related elements. Vibrio sp. RC341 GI-4 and 7
both encode several transposases and a sequence with
homology to an insertion-like sequence in the V. parahaemolyticus insertion sequence element ISV-3L. Vibrio
sp. RC341 GI-6 (VCJ_002614 to VCJ002618), ca. 4962 bp
region of hypothetical proteins and transposases, is
inserted at the homologous locus for V. cholerae O1 Classical CTXΦ, a locus shown to harbor a variety of GIs and
phages [17] (see Additional file 11).

Conclusions
The genomes of two new Vibrio species previously characterized as variant V. cholerae, have been sequenced and
their sequences used to describe their interesting and
important features. The genomes of both species reveal
significant nucleotide sequence divergence (12 to 15%)
from each other and from V. cholerae and V. mimicus
genomes, supporting the conclusion that both represent
unique species not described before. Moreover, genes
conserved among V. cholerae, V. mimicus, and the two
new species varied sufficiently to suggest ancient speciation via genetic drift of the ancestral core genomic backbone. Furthermore, results of our analyses suggest Vibrio
sp. RC341 to have evolved from a progenitor of V. cholerae and V. mimicus, whereas Vibrio sp. RC586 is concluded to have evolved from an early V. mimicus clade.
Although the ANI of all genomes analyzed in this study
demonstrates divergence, putative genomic islands were
found to cross species boundaries, often at an higher ANI
than the conserved backbone. These data, coupled with
phylogenetic analyses, point to lateral transfer of the
islands and phages among V. cholerae, V. mimicus, Vibrio
sp. RC341, and Vibrio sp. RC586 in the natural environment. Furthermore, homologous GI insertion loci were
present in both new species and in the case of V. cholerae,
these insertion loci were not GI-specific. The pool of
DNA laterally transferred between and among members
of the Vibrionaceae strongly suggests that near-neighbors
of V. cholerae act as reservoirs of transferable genetic ele-

Haley et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:154
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/154

ments and virulence in the environment and that V. cholerae is not alone in propagating these elements therein.
Results of this study also demonstrate a widespread allelic
variation in these elements and evidence of evolution of
mobile genetic elements, including pathogenicity islands,
through a multistep mosaic recombination with other
elements, including phage. The ability of vibrios to incorporate exogenous DNA at several loci that encode a large
combination of GIs, thereby, allows optimization of the
genome for success in a specific niche or wider ecology in
the natural environment.

Methods
Genome sequencing

Draft sequences were obtained from a blend of Sanger
and 454 sequences and involved paired end Sanger
sequencing on 8 kb plasmid libraries to 5× coverage, 20×
coverage of 454 data, and optional paired end Sanger
sequencing on 35 kb fosmid libraries to 1-2× coverage
(depending on repeat complexity). To finish the genomes,
a collection of custom software and targeted reaction
types were used. In addition to targeted sequencing strategies, Solexa data in an untargeted strategy were used to
improve low quality regions and to assist gap closure.
Repeat resolution was performed using in house custom
software [37]. Targeted finishing reactions included
transposon bombs [38], primer walks on clones, primer
walks on PCR products, and adapter PCR reactions.
Gene-finding and annotation were achieved using an
automated annotation server [39]. The genomes of these
organisms have been deposited in the NCBI Genbank
database (accession nos. NZ_ACZT00000000 and
NZ_ADBD00000000).
Comparative genomics

Genome to genome comparison was performed using
three approaches, since completeness and quality of
nucleotide sequences varied from strain to strain in the
set examined in this study. Firstly, nucleotide sequences,
as whole contigs were directly aligned using the MUMmer program [16]. Secondly, ORFs of a given pair of
genomes were reciprocally compared each other, using
the BLASTN, BLASTP and TBLASTX programs (ORFdependent comparison). Thirdly, a bioinformatic pipeline
was developed to identify homologous regions of a given
query ORF. Initially, a segment on a target contig homologous to a query ORF was identified using the BLASTN
program. This potentially homologous region was
expanded in both directions by 2,000 bp, after which,
nucleotide sequences of the query ORF and selected target homologous region were aligned using a pairwise
global alignment algorithm [40]. The resultant matched
region in the subject contig was extracted and saved as a
homolog (ORF-independent comparison). Orthologs and

Page 8 of 10

paralogs were differentiated by reciprocal comparison. In
most cases, both ORF-dependent and -independent comparisons yielded the same orthologs, though the ORFindependent method performed better for draft
sequences of low quality, in which sequencing errors,
albeit rare, hampered identification of correct ORFs.
To determine average nucleotide (ANI) and average
amino acid identities (AAI) for the purpose of assigning
genetic distances between strains and strains to species
groups, a recripocal best match BLASTN analysis was
performed for each genome. The average similarity
between genomes was measured as the average nucleotide identity (ANI) and average amino acid identity
(AAI) of all conserved protein-coding genes, following
the methods of Konstantinidis and Tiedje [41]. By this
method, AAI>95% and ANI>94% with >85% of proteincoding genes conserved between the pair of genomes, is
judged to correspond to strains of the same species,
whereas AAI<95% and ANI <94% and <85% conservation
of protein-coding genes indicate different species. Dinucleotide relative abundances were determined for each
genome used in this analysis. Genomic dissimilarities
between genomes were determined following the methods of Karlin et al. [42]. A multi-locus sequence analysis
(MLSA) was determined following standard methods for
the Vibrionaceae [21]. Data for the MLSA were reported
as percent similarity between concatenated homologous
ORFs for the genomes which encoded these ORFs. These
criteria were applied to results of the analyses employed
in this study.
Identification and annotation of genomic islands

Putative genomic islands (GIs) were defined as a continuous array of five or more ORFs discontinuously distributed among genomes of test strains following the
methods of Chun et al [17]. Correct transfer or insertion
of GIs was differentiated from deletion events by comparing genome-based phylogenetic trees and complete
matrices of pairwise orthologous genes between test
strains. Identified GIs were designated, and annotated
using the BLASTP search of its member ORFs against the
Genbank nr database. Arrays of continuous unique ORFs
annotated as encoding phage-related elements and/or
transposases were also identified as putative genomic
islands. Genomic islets were identified as regions less
than 5 ORFs and flanked by genomic island insertion loci
[17]. Putative genomic islands were also investigated
using the web-based application IslandViewer [43].
Phylogenetic analyses employing genome sequences

A set of orthologues for each ORF of V. cholerae N16961
was obtained for different sets of strains, and individually
aligned using the CLUSTALW2 program [44]. The resultant multiple alignments were concatenated to generate

Haley et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:154
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/154

genome scale alignments that were subsequently used to
reconstruct the neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree [45].
The evolutionary model of Kimura was used to generate
the distance matrix [46]. The MEGA program was used
for phylogenetic analysis [47].
