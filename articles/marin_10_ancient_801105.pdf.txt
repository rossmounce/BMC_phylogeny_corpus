Ancient origin of animal U-box ubiquitin ligases
Ignacio Marín

Abstract
Background: The patterns of emergence and diversification of the families of ubiquitin ligases provide insights
about the evolution of the eukaryotic ubiquitination system. U-box ubiquitin ligases (UULs) are proteins
characterized by containing a peculiar protein domain known as U box. In this study, the origin of the animal UUL
genes is described.
Results: Phylogenetic and structural data indicate that six of the seven main UUL-encoding genes found in
humans (UBE4A, UBE4B, UIP5, PRP19, CHIP and CYC4) were already present in the ancestor of all current metazoans
and the seventh (WDSUB1) is found in placozoans, cnidarians and bilaterians. The fact that only 4 - 5 genes
orthologous to the human ones are present in the choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis suggests that several
animal-specific cooptions of the U box to generate new genes occurred. Significantly, Monosiga contains five
additional UUL genes that are not present in animals. One of them is also present in distantly-related protozoans.
Along animal evolution, losses of UUL-encoding genes are rare, except in nematodes, which lack three of them.
These general patterns are highly congruent with those found for other two families (RBR, HECT) of ubiquitin
ligases.
Conclusions: Finding that the patterns of emergence, diversification and loss of three unrelated families of
ubiquitin ligases (RBR, HECT and U-box) are parallel indicates that there are underlying, linage-specific evolutionary
forces shaping the complexity of the animal ubiquitin system.

Background
In eukaryotes, protein ubiquitination is a key biochemical mechanism involved in multiple cellular processes,
which range from its main role in the control of protein
quality and protein levels, as part of the ubiquitinproteasome system, to the regulation of gene expression
[1-3]. Understanding the groups of proteins that are
either involved in ubiquitinating or in regulating the
ubiquitination system is therefore highly significant.
Among these proteins, ubiquitin ligases (also known as
E3s) are particularly interesting. In all eukaryotes, E3s
are numerous, structurally diverse and, most relevant
from a functional point of view, they provide specificity
to the ubiquitination process [3]. In the last years, the
problem of characterizing how the groups of ubiquitin
ligases have emerged has attracted a significant degree
of attention. In particular, my group has contributed to
the determination of the evolutionary history and patterns of diversification of two classes of stand-alone

Científicas (IBV-CSIC). Valencia, Spain

ubiquitin ligases: 1) the RBR family, a particular kind of
ring finger-containing proteins characterized by having a
RING1 - IBR - RING2 domain signature [4-8]; and, 2)
the HECT family, which includes all proteins with
HECT domains [9]. In humans, these families respectively have 15 and 28 members [5,9]. We also analyzed
the proteins of the cullin family, which are essential
units of ubiquitin ligase complexes. This family includes
8 different human proteins [10].
In some cases, the origin of these E3s can be traced
back to early eukaryotic evolution. For example, three of
the twelve subfamilies of the RBR family (called Ariadne,
ARA54 and Helicase) [4,7,8] or the three main types of
cullin proteins [10] are present in both animals and
plants. On the contrary, many other proteins have been
found to be of more recent origin, e. g. they are animalspecific. When the analyses are focused on the metazoan
lineage, a particular pattern has been found in both the
RBR and the HECT families, consisting in two distinct
processes: 1) an early diversification, in such a way that
animals as different as a placozoan, an anemone and a
human have basically the same repertoire, and often a

similar number, of ubiquitin ligases of a given family; 2)
losses of a substantial number of ubiquitin ligases in a
few animal lineages, especially in nematodes and urochordates, and to a lesser extent in insects [7,9].
To further determine the generality of this pattern, I
decided to undertake the study of another important type
of E3 proteins, the U-box ubiquitin ligases (UULs). UULs
were discovered more than ten years ago [11]. They are
characterized by having a protein domain, the U box,
which is structurally related to the RING finger, typical of
many other ubiquitin ligases [12,13]. Evidence for several
of these proteins to be biochemically acting as ubiquitin
ligases, both initiating and elongating ubiquitin chains,
was soon obtained [11,14,15]. There are at least seven
UUL-encoding genes in humans, namely the two very
similar UBE4A and UBE4B genes (sometimes respectively
called UFD2b and UFD2a), CHIP (also known as STUB1),
UIP5 (a. k. a. UBOX5), PRP19 (a. k. a. PRPF19, SNEV),
CYC4 (a. k. a. PPIL2, Cyp-60) and WDSUB1 [11,12,14].
Recently, an eighth gene, ACT1 (a. k. a. TRAF3IP2) has
been described as encoding a ubiquitin ligase that may
contain a very divergent U box [16].
Functional information for the roles of the products of
these genes is variable, from almost non-existent to
extensive. The best-known protein is Chip, which acts
both as a cochaperone, together with chaperones such
as Hsc70, Hsp70 and Hsp90 [17,18] and as a ubiquitin
ligase, alone or as part of complexes that include other
E3s, such as the RBR ubiquitin ligase parkin [15,19,20].
Recessive mutations in the parkin gene are a wellknown cause of familial Parkinson disease, and therefore
it is of significant interest that Chip is acting also on the
products of several other familial Parkinson disease
genes, such as SNCA (which encodes a-synuclein;
[21,22]) and LRRK2 [23,24]. The involvement of Chip in
interacting and/or ubiquitinating other proteins involved
in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Tau and APP
(both implicated in Alzheimer disease; [25-28]), Malin
(another ubiquitin ligase, involved in Lafora disease;
[29]) and, finally, ataxin-1 and ataxin-3 (associated
respectively to spinocerebellar ataxia types 1 and 3;
[30,31]) indicates general roles in the nervous system.
Consistent with a highly pleiotropic phenotype, CHIP
null mutant mice show shortened life span, accelerated
aging and anomalous oxidative stress and protein quality
levels [32].
Much less is known of the functions of the rest of
UULs. PRP19 encodes a splicing factor required for the
activation of the spliceosome in both Saccharomyces cerevisiae [33] and mammals [34]. It is part of an evolutionary conserved protein complex known as Nineteen/
NTC in yeasts and Prp19/CDC5L in mammalian species
[34,35] Although is has been determined to have ubiquitin ligase activity [14], the precise roles linked to that

activity are unknown. Yeast, Drosophila and mouse
Prp19 null mutants are lethal [36-38]. Two other UULencoding genes, UBE4A and UBE4B, are also related to
a yeast gene, Ufd2. This non-essential gene was first
characterized as encoding a protein able to elongate
polyubiquitin chains (E4 protein) [11]. Evidence for ubiquitin ligase (E3) activity for the mouse Ube4a (Ufd2b)
and Ube4b (Ufd2a) proteins was soon obtained [14]. As
described above for Chip, the Ube4a and Ube4b mouse
proteins have been shown to interact with chaperones,
such as, respectively, DnaJc7 and VCP/p97 [25,39]. The
substrates of Ube4a or Ube4b in mammals remain largely unknown, although some preliminary information
has been already obtained (see e. g. [40,41]). In the
nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the products of the
orthologs of UBE4B and CHIP, called respectively Ufd-2
and Chn-1, form a complex with the chaperone Cdc-48
(homologous to mammalian VCP/p97) and ubiquitinate
another chaperone, called Unc-45, which is required for
correct muscle formation [42,43]. It has been suggested
that the same biochemical process occur in humans, in
which VCP/p97 gain-of-function mutations lead to a
syndrome leading to myopathy, bone anomalies and,
often, dementia [43,44]. Presence of human Ube4a protein has been described in multiple tissues while mouse
Ube4b protein was detected in cardiac muscle during
development and mostly in the nervous system in adults
[39,45,46]. Whether the cardiac muscle phenotype and
the results described above for worm and mammalian
muscles are related is unknown. Consistent with those
data, mice harboring loss-of-function Ube4b mutations
in homozygosis die before birth, while heterozygotes
show multiple nervous system anomalies that worsen
with age [46]. Overexpression of mouse UBE4B also
leads to neurodegeneration in parallel to the generation
of ubiquitin inclusions [47]. CYC4, originally called Cyp60, was first characterized as encoding a divergent cyclophilin, which was only much later shown to be also a
UUL [14,48]. Some cyclophilins work as cochaperones,
and in fact Cyc4 proteins has been shown to interact
with the chaperone Hsp90 [25]. The biochemical functions of Cyc4 are still poorly understood. None of the
two potential biological effects described so far for Cyc4
have been related to the protein acting as a UUL
[49,50]. In C. elegans, the ortholog of CYC4, called mog6, is involved in the switch from spermatogenesis to
oogenesis in hermaphrodite worms [51]. The last UUL
for which there is some information is Uip5, which has
been shown also to interact with the VCP/p97 protein,
mentioned above [25]. The roles of WDSUB1 are totally
unknown.
Research in UUL proteins and UUL-encoding genes in
animals would benefit by having them included in an
evolutionary framework, which provides three different

Marín BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:331
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/331

types of data. First, the patterns of presence/absence of
the genes in different species, useful not only to understand the evolution of the genes, but also to determine
the best animal models and eventually to better understand the phenotypes found in mutants (e. g. potential
redundancies among closely related proteins). Second,
the speed of the evolution of a same gene in different
species, which may suggest either differences in their
evolutionary constraints or new functional roles. Finally,
the patterns of evolution of the structures of the proteins, which, if changes are present, may lead also to the
generation of novel functional hypothesis, testable in the
laboratory. Here, I describe the evolutionary history of
all UUL-encoding genes in animals, using when needed
external data, most especially from the genome of the
closest animal relative sequenced so far, the choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis. I show that these genes follow the same evolutionary pattern as other E3s:
diversification in early animal history followed by simplification in particular lineages. In most groups, these
UUL-encoding genes are very conservative, but, as
described for other ubiquitin ligase families (see above),
nematode species turn out once again to be exceptional,
given that they have lost three UUL-encoding genes.
The functional implications of these results are
discussed.

Methods
To generate comprehensive databases of UULs, TblastN
searches were performed using the sequences of the
human U-box proteins as queries against the nr, htgs,
gss, est and wgs databases of the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) [52]. The sequences
obtained were aligned using Clustal X 2.07 [53] to
determine the regions of highest similarity within each
gene (see below). All subsequent searches were focused
on these conserved regions, the rest of the sequences
were discarded. To obtain the final, exhaustive databases, TblastN searches against the same databases
described above, using as queries the conserved regions
of orthologous genes of several divergent species, were
performed until no additional sequences were found. In
that way, all the UUL sequences that either belonged to
animal species or to the choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis present in the databases (circa April 2010) were
selected. Monosiga can be used as a convenient outgroup to establish the genes that were already present
when animals emerged, given that choanoflagellates are
considered the closest living relatives of animals [54].
From this dataset, only complete or almost complete
sequences, which could be aligned along the whole
length or at least a large fraction of the conserved
regions, were kept for the phylogenetic analyses. However, additional, specific TblastN searches were

Page 3 of 15

performed to characterize whether fragments of UULs
in basal animal species (such as placozoans or cnidarians) or from lophotrochozoan invertebrates (for which
sequence data is limited) existed which could have been
missed before. Also, nematode-specific searches were
performed at the Nembase4 web page [55,56] to confirm
the conclusions of loss of UUL-encoding genes in these
organisms. Once all the gene-specific databases were
finished, each group of orthologous sequences was
aligned using again Clustal X 2.07 and the alignments
were manually corrected with GeneDoc 2.7 [57].
While this paper was being revised, the final draft genome sequence of the sponge Amphimedon queenslandica was reported [58]. Given the interest in including
sequences of this species, several of them unavailable in
my original searches, I performed additional TblastN
searches against the same NCBI databases indicated
above. These searches were finished in September 2010.
Seven genes or gene fragments were detected in A.
queenslandica that were incorporated to generate final
alignments.
From those alignments, phylograms were obtained
using three different methods of phylogenetic reconstruction. First, Neighbor-joining (NJ) trees were characterized
using MEGA 4 [59]. Second, Maximum-parsimony (MP)
trees were obtained using PAUP* 4.0, beta 10 version
[60]. Finally, maximum-likelihood (ML) trees were
obtained using PHYML 3.0 [61]. The parameters used
were in general the same detailed in [7]. However, two
minor changes were made to refine the analyses: 1) for
MP, the maximum number of tied trees was increased
from 20 to 100 and the tree-bisection-reconnection algorithm, which is more exhaustive and precise than the
subtree pruning-regrafting method used in [7], was chosen; 2) For ML, the improved Le and Gascuel matrix of
amino acidic substitutions [62] was used instead of the
older Blosum62 matrix. In all the analyses, 1000 bootstrap replicates were performed to establish the reliability
of the NJ and MP trees. For ML, which is much more
computer intensive, 100 bootstrap replicates were
obtained. Finally, structural analyses of UUL proteins
were performed with InterProScan [63].

Results
Figure 1 shows the structures of the human UULs and
details of their conserved regions, all of them including
the U boxes. The protein sequences of these conserved
regions (detailed in Additional Files 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and
7) have been used to obtain the alignments on which
this study is based. It was fortunate to find out that all
the UULs contain long conserved regions of similarity,
given that this allows classifying almost all UUL
sequences as orthologous of one of the seven human
genes. A few exceptions will be discussed below. I will

Figure 1 Structures of human UULs. Protein domains, according to InterProScan analyses, are indicated. The lines indicate the conserved
regions used in the sequence comparison and phylogenetic analyses. These regions would correspond to the following amino acids in the
human proteins (in parenthesis, total number of amino acids of the protein; start and end of the conserved region): Chip (303 aa; 25-303), Prp19
(504 aa; 1 - 504), UBE4a (1066 aa; 336-1061), UBE4b (1300 aa; 639-1277), Cyc4 (527 aa; 1-452), UIP5 (541 aa; 1-336), and WDSUB1 (476 aa; 271472).

now proceed to detail the results for each of the seven
orthology groups, logically naming them as the human
genes.
1) Chip: Chip proteins are characterized by containing 3 N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs),
involved in protein-protein interactions, and a Cterminal U-box (Figure 1). The gene Chip is ancient,
being detectable in plants, fungi and multiple protozoan species ([64] and unpublished observations).
Figure 2 shows the tree with the complete/almost
complete Chip sequences detected in animal species.
In all species for which genomic data is extensive, a
single Chip gene is found. Figure 2 includes just two
lophotrochozoan species, namely the platyhelminthes
Schistosoma japonicum and S. mansoni. However,
fragments of sequences with high similarity with
Chip were detected in the genomes of many other
lophotrochozoans, as molluscs (Aplysia, Euprymna
and Crassostrea genera) and annelids (Capitella,
Tubifex, Hirudo). Exceptionally, the gene was not
found in the choanoflagellate M. brevicollis. In the
alignments, it was particularly noticeable the high
level of sequence divergence in the genes of Caenorhabditis nematode species. This is obvious in Figure
2: notice the “normal” position of the closely related

nematode Brugia malayi, while Caenorhabditis
sequences are separated from the rest of the tree
and have much longer branches. Given that Drosophila and Caenorhabditis are both ecdysozoans,
their divergence from the lineage that gave rise to
humans occurred at the same time. Therefore, one
would expect to find similar degrees of divergence
when the human proteins are compared to either
the fly or nematode proteins. However, for Chip that
expectation is not fulfilled. Along the conserved
region of 279 amino acids analyzed, the resemblance
between human and Drosophila Chip proteins (identity 56%, similarity 76%) is much higher than the
one found in the comparison human Chip vs. nematode Chip (identity: 38%, similarity: 58%).
2) Prp19: its origin also predates the emergence of
animals, given that it is detectable in many other
organisms, such as yeasts, where it was discovered
[33] and plants [65,66]. The PRP19 protein is characterized by having an N-terminal U box, followed by a
specific region of homology [67] and 7 C-terminal
WD40 repeats, also typical protein-protein interaction domains (Figure 1). As shown in Figure 3, single
Prp19 genes are found in all animal species analyzed
and in Monosiga brevicollis. Additional partial
sequences in molluscs (Lottia, Aplysia) and annelids

Figure 2 Chip proteins in animals. The phylogram indicates the species and accession numbers of the corresponding Chip sequences. Notice
the high divergence of the Caenorhabditis sequences, discussed in the main text. Bootstrap support, in percentage, is indicated. The numbers
respectively correspond to the bootstrap results for the NJ, MP and ML methods of phylogenetic reconstruction (see Material and methods; they
are indicated as NJ/MP/ML, around the corresponding branches). In this and the following figures, asterisks indicate 100% bootstrap support
according to the three methods. Values have been shown only when at least two of the three percentages were above 50%. Also, for
simplification, bootstrap support for external branches (e. g. within mammals or for Drosophila species) is not detailed in this or the following
trees.

(Platynereis, Capitella), were also detected. As
described above for Chip, nematode Prp19 protein
sequences (this time including also the one in Brugia)
appear as very divergent in the tree (Figure 3). Again,
the resemblance between human and Drosophila melanogaster proteins along the conserved region examined for Prp19 (504 amino acids) was substantially
higher (65% identity, 81% similarity) than the similitude between human and Caenorhabditis elegans
(51% identity; 69% similarity).
3, 4) UBE4A and UBE4B: all the proteins related to
Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ufd2p, among them
UBE4A and UBE4B, contain a large stretch of similarity (called “Ufd2P_core” in the Pfam domain database [68]), N-terminally respect to the U box. The U
box itself is located at the C terminus (Figure 1).

The ancient origin of these genes, present in all
eukaryotes, is well documented (e. g. [69]). The
duplication UBE4A/UBE4B seems to have occurred
in early animal evolution. Most animals, including
sponges, have both genes (Figures 4 and 5). The
exception are nematodes (Caenorhabditis, Brugia),
which lack UBE4A. Fragments of a single Ufd2-like
gene were detected in Monosiga brevicollis, being
thus likely that the UBE4A/UBE4B duplication
occurred after the choanoflagellate/metazoan split.
In addition of those shown in Figures 4 and 5, partial sequences of UBE4A and UBE4B orthologs were
found in molluscs (both genes detected in Aplysia,
Lottia and Crassostrea), annelids (both found in
Capitella and Hirudo) and platyhelminthes (UBE4A
present in Schistosoma and Schmidtea; notice that

Figure 3 Phylogram for PRP19 protein sequences. Conventions as in Figure 2. In red, the sequence of the choanoflagellate M. brevicollis.
Again, nematode sequences are very divergent.

Figure 5 shows that Schmidtea mediterranea may
have two UBE4B genes). For UBE4B, high divergence of nematode (Caenorhabditis, Brugia) and also
Ciona and Schmidtea sequences is again suggested
by the long branches observed in Figure 5. Along a
638 amino acids-long conserved regions, human
UBE4B protein is much more similar to Drosophila
melanogaster UBE4B (identity 44%, similarity 68%)
than to the Caenorhabditis elegans orthologous protein (identity 32%, similarity 54%).
5) CYC4: CYC4 proteins are characterized by having
an N-terminal U box and a cyclophilin (a. k. a.
Pro_isomerase) domain near to their C terminus
(Figure 1). This type of proteins has been described
in fungi [70] and plants [71], so their origin is also
ancient. Figure 6 summarizes the phylogenetic analyses for the sequences of all CYC4 proteins detected

in animals. Again, a single gene is found in all species, from sponges to humans. It is also present in
M. brevicollis. Additional fragments of similar
sequences were detected in molluscs (Aplysia, Lottia), annelids (Alvinella, Helobdella) and platyhelminthes (Schmidtea). Notably, once again nematode
sequences appear in the tree as highly divergent
(Figure 6). This time however, the human/D. melanogaster and human/C. elegans comparisons do not
show a large discrepancy (Hs/Dm: identity 55%,
similarity 76%; Hs/Ce: identity 51%, similarity 67%.
Length of conserved sequence: 452 amino acids).
6) UIP5: The structure of the protein encoded by
this gene (Figure 1) is peculiar in two ways. First,
the U box is found in all the rest of UULs very close
to their N- or C-terminal ends, but here is found in
the middle of the protein. Also, UIP5 contains a

Marín BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:331

other sequences is ambiguous.

second domain typical of ubiquitin ligases, the RING
finger. This last feature could be interpreted as the
U box being dispensable for UIP5 acting as a ubiquitin ligase. However, this is not true. The presence of
the U box, but not of the RING finger, is required
for the E3 activity of the protein [14]. Also, the U
box of UIP5 has been shown to mediate interactions
with the ubiquitin-conjugating (E2) enzymes [72].
The evolution of this gene has never been studied
before. I have not detected UIP5 outside the animals,
even Monosiga lacks one. It is very unlikely that this
is due to distant orthologs being very divergent and
thus difficult to detect, given that the C-terminal
sequences of UIP5 used to screen the databases are
very characteristic, long (336 amino acids, including
the U box) and well conserved within animals.
Therefore, Figure 7 is a good summary of all the
organisms in which UIP5 exists. Most animals,
including sponges, contain a UIP5 gene, but, interestingly, nematodes such as Caenorhabditis and Brugia have lost it. In lophotrochozoans, UIP5 genes
have been detected in molluscs (Aplysia, Lottia), but
not in annelids or platyhelminthes. A potential

duplicate is observed in the tetraploid amphibian
Xenopus laevis (Figure 7).
7) WDSUB1: the protein encoded by this gene is
characterized by containing 7 WD40 repeats and a
SAM_2 domain in addition of the U box (Figure 1).
SAM domains, as WD40 repeats, are involved in protein-protein interactions. The gene has not been analyzed from an evolutionary point of view in previous
studies. I found that bona fide WDSUB1 genes are
restricted to animals. Figure 8 contains an alignment
that has been obtained including in most cases the
most C-terminal WD40 repeat (which is highly conserved), the SAM domain and the U box (as schematized in Figure 1). However, there are three
exceptions. First, Monosiga brevicollis contains a gene
clearly related to WDSUB1 in sequence (e. g. it has a
very similar U box) but not in structure, given that it
can be deduced that it encodes a protein with 2 SAM
domains but without WD40 repeats (red dot in Figure 8). Second, I found a sequence of the sponge
Amphimedon that encodes for a protein with 6
WD40 repeats and a U box, very similar to the one in
WDSUB1 proteins, but lacks SAM domains (white

dot). Finally, a few sequences having just the SAM
and U box domains, but lacking the WD40 domain,
have been also detected (black dots in Figure 8). Curiously, two of them come from the genomes of species of two other sponges (Oscarella, Leucetta). Thus,
WDSUB1-related genes appeared before the emergence of animals, but bona fide WDSUB1 genes,
encoding proteins with the characteristic WD40 SAM - U box signature, seem to have originated
more recently, after the ancestors of sponges diverged
from the ancestor of the rest of animals. Notably,
WDSUB1 genes are again absent in nematodes (Caenorhabditis, Brugia) and also in the fruit flies of the
Drosophila genus, although they are present in some
other insect species (Figure 8). They have neither
been found in any lophotrochozoan species for which
genomic data are available. Therefore, of all the UULencoding genes, WDSUB1 is clearly the one most
prone to be lost. Finally, a duplication has been
detected in some fish species (see also Figure 8).
As it was indicated in the Introduction, a potential
eighth UUL-encoding human gene, Act1, has been

recently described [16]. Although similarity of the putative U box encoded by Act1 with the rest of U boxes is
very weak (data not shown), the evolutionary conservation of this gene was also analyzed. It was found to be
restricted to mammals. In addition of determining the
orthologs of the known human UUL genes, it was also
significant to establish whether additional genes existed
that were present in other species but not in humans.
Along these searches, I detected sequences that correspond to an additional UUL-encoding gene in the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis (Nv_UBOXa; accession
number XM_001634368.1) and surprisingly, five extra
genes in the choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis
(Mb_UBOXa - e; Accession numbers: XM_001744651.1,
XM_001750473.1, XM_001748123.1, XM_001749475.1
and XM_001743344.1 respectively). None of these
sequences contained the conserved regions characteristic
of the seven canonical UUL-encoding genes. The structures of their predicted proteins are detailed in Figure 9.

Mb_UBOXa, Mb_UBOXb and Mb_UBOXc, which all
have characteristic structures. The first one contains a
von Willebrand factor type A (VWA) domain, a protein-protein interaction domain present in a large number of intra- and extracellular proteins [73]. The second
contains a single ankyrin repeat, also a well-known protein-protein interaction domain. Finally, Mb_UBOXc is
predicted to encode a protein with a glycosyl hydrolase
domain. Specific searches were performed to detect
genes related to these six exceptional ones in other species. In just one case, Mb_UBOXa, clearly related
sequences were detected in a few protozoans of distantly
related groups, such as the heterolobosean Naegleria
gruberi (Accession number XM_002676557.1), the
unclassified anaerobic flagellate Trimastix pyriformis
(Acc. No. EC839610.1) and the diplomonad Spironucleus
vortens (Acc. No. GH177899.1) among others. All these
sequences potentially encode proteins with the same
structure that the one generated by Mb_UBOXa. Therefore, although five of the six novel genes discovered in
cnidarians or choanoflagellates seem to be lineage-

specific, Mb_UBOXa is an ancient gene which is not
present in animals.
The most parsimonious hypothesis to explain the evolutionary origin of the UUL-encoding genes described in
this study is depicted in Figure 10. A rapid summary is
that the seven main animal genes (i. e. all but Act1) originated long time ago. Proteins structurally identical to
the seven corresponding human UULs were already present in early animal evolution, given that they are found
in placozoans, cnidarians and bilaterians. Since then,
losses have been scarce, although WDSUB1 has been
lost independently several times (Figure 10). A notable
exception to this pattern, also found for RBR and HECT
ubiquitin ligases [7,9], is that nematodes lack three
UUL-encoding genes (UBE4A, UIP5 and WDSUB1).
TblastN searches against the databases at Nembase4,
which compiles all the available information for nematode ESTs, confirmed that orthologs of those three
genes are not detected in any species. It is also interesting that only a few lineage-specific new genes have been
detected. Among all the organisms examined, it turns

out that it is the simplest, the unicellular choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis, the one with the most extensive set of U box ubiquitin ligases. The data so far
available suggest that this is largely due to the emergence of additional, novel genes in choanoflagellates.

Discussion and Conclusions
The evolutionary analysis of the available UUL
sequences makes clear the patterns of emergence of the
genes that encode these proteins. Four main results
have been obtained. The first result is that animal UULencoding genes are ancient. Seven of the genes today
found in our species appeared before the emergence of
animals (Chip, PRP19, CYC4, which are present in many
other eukaryotic groups) or in early animal evolution
(UIP5, a bona fine WDSUB1 gene and the duplicates
UBE4A and UBE4B. These last three genes actually
derive from related genes already present before animals
arose; Figure 10). The only exception is Act1, which

encodes a protein that may contain a highly divergent
U-box and is mammalian-specific. The second result is
that the UUL-encoding genes are, as a whole, highly
conserved in animals. The only exception is WDSUB1,
which has been lost independently several times (Figure
10). The third main result is that nematodes have lost
three UUL-encoding genes, something that has not
occurred in any other lineage. In addition, the remnant
nematode genes often have highly divergent sequences,
which make them appear in abnormal positions in the
phylogenetic trees (see Figures 2, 3, 5 and 6). This high
level of divergence has been confirmed by comparing
the level of similarity between orthologous Homo and
Caenorhabditis proteins with the level found in the corresponding Homo/Drosophila comparisons. The expectation is that both levels are identical but, in all cases, the
nematode proteins are more divergent, and often much
more so (see Results). The final result concerns the
unexpectedly large number of UUL-encoding genes

found in choanoflagellates but not in animals, a total of
five (Figure 9). One of them, Mb_UBOXa, turns to be
an ancient gene that was lost in early animal evolution.
It is notable how these patterns are often coincidental
with those found for RBR and HECT ubiquitin ligaseencoding genes [7,9]. First, most genes of those two
families are also either very ancient, being present in
most/all eukaryotes, or, alternatively, arose in early animal evolution. In all cases, animals as simple as a placozoan or a cnidarian have sets of genes that are largely
the same found in humans. In addition, the structural
diversity of RBR and HECT proteins has remained basically the same since animals emerged. A second main
result is that losses of RBR and HECT genes in particular lineages, and most especially in nematodes, are also
observed. If we put together the results for the three E3
families (RBR, HECT and U-box), it is found that, out
of 38 genes present before the cnidarian/bilaterian split,
20 have been lost in Caenorhabditis elegans, while only
2 are not present in the anemone Nematostella vectensis
or in our own species. This result points to an extreme,

Page 12 of 15

general streamlining of the ubiquitin system in nematodes. Urochordates, such as Ciona intestinalis, are a
second group in which both RBR and HECT E3s have
been abundantly lost (8 out of 31 genes are missing).
However, all UUL-encoding genes are present in Ciona
(Figure 10), so this pattern is not as general as the one
detected in nematodes. Finally, four HECT choanoflagellate-specific genes have been also described [9], suggesting that choanoflagellates have often independently
increased their number of ubiquitin ligases. As indicated
in the Introduction, several UULs have roles in the
mammalian nervous system. However, given their presence in sponges or placozoans, which lack that system,
it can be safely concluded that these roles must have
been acquired relatively recently respect to the origin of
the UUL-encoding genes. However, the fact that both
the sponge Amphimedon and the placozoan Trichoplax
have many genes involved in typical neuronal functions
[58,74] suggests that many conditions required for the
generation of a complex nervous system were already
present in the last common ancestor of all animals.

Figure 10 Patterns of emergence and loss of UULs in selected animals and in M. brevicollis. This figure summarizes the most
parsimonious hypothesis to explain the patterns of emergence and loss of UUL-encoding genes in selected species. Arrows indicate gene
emergences and rectangles, gene losses. UBE4-like and WDSUB1-like refer to the presence of genes which encode proteins similar in sequence
but different in structure to the canonical vertebrate proteins. Lophotrochozoan data are still quite fragmentary and some groups may have lost
UUL-encoding genes.

Marín BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:331
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/331

In this sense, the early origin of UULs parallels the
emergence of other types of proteins which are critical
in the function of complex animals, yet appear much
earlier in evolutionary history (reviewed by [75-77]).
In conclusion, the analysis of the U-box ubiquitin
ligases in animals confirms and extends our previous
findings about the general patterns of diversification
that explain the current diversity of E3 proteins in animals. An additional result that may have experimental
interest is the detection of a general simplification of
the ubiquitin ligase set of proteins in a model species
such as C. elegans. This may facilitate a fast determination in the nematode of the functions of these proteins
and perhaps of the ubiquitination system as a whole.
