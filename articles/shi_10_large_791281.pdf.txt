Abstract
Background: Clostridium beijerinckii is a valuable bacteria species which has the ability of ABE (acetone, butanol
and ethanol) production. It has been shown that Phosphotransferase (PTS) is an important and common system
for both carbohydrate uptake and phosphorylation in bacteria, but detailed study of the system, especially its
fructose/mannose/sorbose family is scant.
Results: In the genome of Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052, a model strain recently sequenced, there are large
number of PTS genes, among them 9 complete sets belong to the fructose/mannose/sorbose family of its enzyme
II complex. Our study, based on evidences provided by phylogenetic relationship, analyses of gene contents and
clusters, as well as synteny examination, indicates that it is possible to further classify this PTS family into three subgroups, which are corresponding to the three sugar substrates. Furthermore, we proposed a model how these PTS
systems are evolved in bacteria.
Conclusion: This work may explain the experimental result that Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 can better
utilize fructose as substrate, thus could lead to a better understanding of the ABE-producing mechanism in
Clostridium beijerinckii and other microbial species. It may help to illustrate a higher butanol-productivity future.

Background
The anaerobic Gram-positive bacterium Clostridium beijerinckii is capable of producing acetone, butanol and
ethanol (which are together called ABE) [1]. These three
are important chemical products, especially butanol,
since it is not only a food-grade solvent, but also an
excellent fuel potentially could be used as a replacement
for oil. Its features such as high boiling point and low
emission are quite desirable [1]. Similar to another
ABE-producing model strain Clostridium acetobutylicum
ATCC 824, the ratio of the solvent produced by Clostridium beijerinckii is close to 3:6:1 (A:B:E, v/v/v) [1,2].
But Clostridium beijerinckii has the advantage that its

fermentation does not require the using of starch, which
is a food source. It can utilize various kinds of biomass,
including ‘waste’ material, therefore can lower the producing cost and enhance its practical competitiveness
[1,3]. Because of its great industrial potential, its model
strain Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 has been
sequenced by JGI (Joint Genome Institute, DOE, USA)
and the genomic data were made public in 2007 (http://
genome.jgi-psf.org/clobe/clobe.home.html). The ABEproducing process starts from pyruvate, the end product
of glycolysis. Pyruvate can be further degraded into
acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA could be transformed into ethanol, or through several steps, into butanol and acetone
(see Figure 1 of the reference [4]). So, the more monosaccharide molecules which are transferred into cells,
and the higher sugar utilization efficiency, the better for
the ABE-production. Phosphotransferase system (PTS)
is an important mechanism for sugar transmembrane

transportation and phosphorylation in bacteria [5-7].
This system is consisted of enzyme I, phosphocarrier
protein (Hpr) and enzyme II complex. Enzyme I and
Hpr will phosphorylate enzyme II, which is also called
permease since it is the unit which carries out the
transmembrane transportation. Enzyme II has A, B, C,
D subunits. In some microbial species these subunits
each exist as a separate peptide, but in some other
cases they may fuse together in various combinations.
The IIB subunit is the one which decides the substrate
specificity. Enzyme II can be classified into at least 7
families [8], according to their specific sugar substrates, and in different families the complex may be
organized in different ways [5]. Among them, the fructose/mannose/sorbose family is the only one which has
IID subunit, and all the members in this family are
capable of transport fructose [6]. The most well known
genes in this family, include fructose-specific ones in
Bacillus subtilis [9], mannose-specific genes in Escherichia coli [10] and sorbose-specific genes in Klebsiella
pneumoniae [11].

Previous studies have revealed that enzyme I and the
phosphocarrier protein (Hpr) of PTS generally has only
one or two copies in clostridium strains, and they
exist in the genomes monocistronically [12]. However,
the genes consisted of the enzyme II complex may have
multiple copies, and often form operons together with
their transcription regulatory units and the genes with
related catalytical functions [13]. Furthermore, the phosphotransferase systems in different types of microbial
species have different mechanisms for regulation. For
low GC Gram-positive bacteria like clostridium, Hpr is
acting as an important switch. When carbon source is
in short supply, Hpr will be phosphorylated on the
serine-46 residue by certain unique Hpr kinase/phosphatase. In contrast, if carbon source is sufficient, the
His-15 site of Hpr is phosphorylated, and the PTSdependent sugar transportation and substrate-specific
regulation are activated [14].
Although the study on phosphotransferase system has
been going on for several decades, most of the previous
reports are concentrated on limited number of model

strains such as Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis.
Since the beginning of this century, there are some
researches on PTS in clostridium, mostly on Clostridium
acetobutylicum ATCC 824, which is the first clostridium
sequenced. The importance of PTS to the life process of
various clostridium strains, and how the system is
evolved, remain largely unknown. This work starts from
the genomic data of Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB
8052, and other sequenced clostridium strains as well as
some important related model species, and analyzes the
complexity of the phosphotransferase system, especially
focusing on the fructose/mannose/sorbose family. We
hope to explain why and how Clostridium beijerinckii
NCIMB 8052 can utilize more types of sugar substrate,
and propose an evolutionary model for the phosphotransferase system. It may help to illustrate the solventproducing mechanism in Clostridium beijerinckii and
other related industrial bacteria, which could have theoretical and practical importance for guiding to higher
butanol production through certain optimizations.

Results and discussion
Large number of PTS II genes are identified in the
Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 genome

Our study finds that there are 47 sets of PTS II genes
in the Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 genome
(See Additional File 1, Table S1). That is far more than
the majority of the other sequenced clostridium strains,
including Clostridium botulinum A str. ATCC 3502
[12], Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 (Table S2),
Clostridium perfringens strain 13 [15] (Table S3), Clostridium tetani E88 [16] (Table S4). Only Clostridium
difficile 630 [17] (Table S5) has a similar number. The
PTS II gene copies in other species which are evolutionarily closer to clostridium are also significantly lower
than that of Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 genome. For example, Bacillus subtilis (Table S6) has 12
sets. These findings are summarized in Table 1. There
are 9 complete sets of PTS II genes which are belonging
to the fructose/mannose/sorbose family among the 47
ones found in the Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052

genome, plus one additional IIA and IIB genes each
(Table 2). Such a large number is never reported in any
other known microbial species, including Clostridium difficile 630 (additional file 1). Their genomic organizations
are illustrated in Figure 1. Interestingly, all the fructose/
mannose/sorbose family PTS II genes on the positive
chain are located on the first half of the genome, while
the ones on the negative chain are on the second half.
In contrast, the PTS enzyme I and the phosphocarrier
protein Hpr, each have only one copy in the Clostridium
beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 genome (Cbei0196 and
Cbei1219, respectively). This is consistent with other
clostridium species.
Analysis of GC content

To study these sets of fructose/mannose/sorbose family
PTS II genes in Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 in
detail, we first calculated their GC percentages (Table 2).
As we can see from the result, the GC contents of
these sets of fructose/mannose/sorbose family PTS II
genes can be divided into three groups, which are indicated in the Table 2 with three different denotations,
with *, # or nothing at all.
For the two sets of Cbei3871/3872/3873/3874 and
Cbei4911/4912/4913/4914, both their GC percentages
are 35.1%. The GC% of Cbei0711/0712/0713 is over
37%. For the remaining sets, their GC percentages are
ranging from 30.3% to 33.1%. Although that of
Cbei2195/2196/2197/2199 is 33.9%, but if the inserted
hypothetical protein Cbei2198 is considered altogether,
it drops to 33.1%. The two orphan genes of this family,
Cbei1840 and Cbei3344, are not necessarily conforming
to this rule. It is noteworthy that the GC percentage of
the Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 whole genome
is only 29.9%, lower than that of any PTS II genes sets.
We will discuss this later.

Synteny analysis

According to Figure 1, the fructose/mannose/sorbose
family PTS II genes in Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB
8052 can also be classified into three groups based on
their synteny features. One group has both sigma-54
factor and sugar isomerase (SIS) in the neighborhood,
such as Cbei0955/0956/0957/0958, Cbei0963/0964/
0965/0966 and Cbei4557/4558/4559/4560. Another
group has sigma-54 factor only, including Cbei3871/
3872/3873/3874 and Cbei4911/4912/4913/4914. The last
group has neither sigma-54 factor nor sugar isomerase,
like Cbei0711/0712/0713. We found these groupings are
quite consistent with the ones discussed in the last section which are based on their GC percentages.
Sigma-54 is a kind of transcriptional factors, commonly existed in bacteria. It can interact with promoters
to activate the transcription process. The first sigma-54
factor, rpoN, was found in 1985 through the sequencing
of Klebsiella pneumoniae [18]. According to previous
report [19] , in Listeria monocytogenes, sigma-54 factordependent fructose/mannose/sorbose PTS II genes are
found to be associated with the bacteria’s sensitivity of
cytotoxin. Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that
their presence around the fructose/mannose/sorbose
PTS II genes in Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052,
could also have certain functional importance.
Construction of phylogenetic tree

Since IIB is the subunit which decides the PTS substrate
specificity, in this part of study we use Cbei3873 as the
query for blastp, and analyze the evolutionary relationship among the PTS fructose/mannose/sorbose family
IIB genes in Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 and
their homologous genes identified from other representative bacteria species (selecting according to the e-value
so that every e-value intervals have representations).
As we can see from the phylogenetic tree in Figure 2,
the PTS fructose/mannose/sorbose family IIB genes in

Figure 2 The phylogenetic tree built using the PTS IIB genes of
fructose/mannose/sorbose family in Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB
8052 and some representative homologs found in other bacteria.

Page 4 of 8

Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 can be grouped
into three clusters too. One cluster contains Cbei0711,
another includes Cbei1840, Cbei3873 and Cbei4913,
while Cbei0956, Cbei0964, Cbei2902 and Cbei4559 are
together in the other. Especially noteworthy is that the
third cluster includes the known sorbose-specific IIB
gene KPN_04803 from Klebsiella pneumoniae.
Among the group which contains Cbei1840, Cbei3873
and Cbei4913, Cbei3873 is 95% identical to Cbei4913,
75% identical to Cbei1840, and 39% identical to the
fructose-specific IIB gene Bsu27060 in Bacillus subtilis over 160 aa (68% positive) (Figure 2). However,
Cbei3873 has also been found to be 59% identical to the
mannose-specific IIAB gene Ecoli_UTI89_C2014. On
the other hand, although Cbei0711 is the closest to Ecoli_UTI89_C2014 in terms of gene organization since in
both cases the IIA and IIB subunits are fused together,
they are not grouped in the same cluster.
This result reveals the complexity of the PTS fructose/mannose/sorbose family. The reason that the
transport systems for these three sugars can be classified into one family is because they are close to each
other, highly homologous to each other, with few
homologies to the genes in other families. But looking
into it in more detail, we can find that PTS II genes for
fructose and mannose transportation are closer than
their relation with that of sorbose. As the result, both
fructose and mannose PTS II genes phosphorylate fructose into phospho-6-fructose (F-6-P), while sorbose
PTS II genes turns it into F-1-P. Furthermore, according to reference [5], the phosphorylation site on the
fructose by the fructose-specific PTS genes is O-6,
instead of the more common O-1 site. This is another
proof that fructose-specific PTS genes are closer to the
mannose-specific ones.
An evolutionary model is proposed

To get a clearer picture of why there are so many copies
of fructose/mannose/sorbose family PTS II genes in
the Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 genome, we
applied the same analytical approaches to the model
strain of Bacillus subtilis, B. subtilis subsp. subtilis str.
168, by identifying all the PTS II genes in its genome,
annotating and classifying each sets as well as calculating their GC percentages. The results are in Table S6
and showed that there are 12 sets of PTS II genes
in B. subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168. One of them
belongs to the fructose/mannose/sorbose family, namely
Bsu27040/27050/27050/27070, which phosphorylates
fructose into F-6-P. The GC percentages of these PTS II
gene sets in B. subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168 are ranging from 44.4% to 50.8%, with that of Bsu27040/27050/
27050/27070 is 44.4%, slightly higher than the GC percentage of the whole genome, which is 43.5%.

Shi et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11(Suppl 11):S9
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105-11-S11

We did the same analysis to the model strain of E. coli,
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. DH10B (Table S7). 25
sets of PTS II genes are identified, including one complete set of the fructose/mannose/sorbose family, i.e.,
ECDH10B 1955/1956/1957. Their GC contents are as
high as 56.1%, and as low as 47.3%, while that of
ECDH10B 1955/1956/1957 is 51.6%, close to the average
GC percentage of the Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr.
DH10B genome, 50.8%.
As the results indicate, in all these bacterial species we
studied, the GC percentages of PTS II gene sets are
generally higher than the overall GC values of the host
genomes. This leads us to speculate that the phosphotransferase system may have originated from certain
high GC percentage microbial species, and during the
evolutionary process lower GC percentage species
acquired the components of this system from higher GC
percentage species through horizontal gene transfer
(HGT). The transfer may occur at an earlier stage of the
evolution, since it becomes clear that the GC percentages of PTS II gene sets are being drawing closer to the
average values of the host species after the transfer. For
example, in Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. DH10B,
they are generally between 50-60%. The values drop to
the interval of 45-50% in B. subtilis subsp. subtilis str.
168. In the clostridium strains in which GC contents are
even lower, the values further decrease. In the case of
Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052, they are 30 to
38%. Of course, this makes sense. Understandably, the
sugar transport system is of the utmost importance to
bacteria, concerning the life or death of each organism.
So this system must have existed in microbial species
for quite a long time. However, as two strains highly
representative of the fructose/mannose/sorbose family,
both the fructose-specific PTS II genes in Bacillus subtilis, and the mannose-specific ones in E. coli, their GC
percentages are closer to the overall GC contents of

Page 5 of 8

their genomes. Therefore, they may be ‘native’ to these
species and later on transferred into Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052.
To test our hypothesis that lower GC content microbial
species obtained PTS II genes from higher GC ones during
the evolutionary process through horizontal gene transfer,
we introduce PTS II genes from the fructose/Mannitol
[20] family as references (use Cbei1844 as the query for
blastp, since it has been confirmed as a member). This
family, which contains no IID subunit, can phosphorylate
fructose into F-1-P. Like the case of Cbei1844, in a lot of
species, the IIABC subunits are fused together as one
gene. Since there is no IID subunit for this fructose/mannitol family, we use representative IIABC genes from the
fructose/mannose/sorbose and fructose/mannitol families,
run blastp separately, and use selected (selecting according
to the e-value so that every e-value intervals have representations) resulting genes from both to construct another
phylogenetic tree (Figure 3A). We also construct the
16sRNA tree of the species involved (Figure 3B). As
shown in the 16sRNA tree, these studied species fall into
two groups. Escherichia coli UTI89, Klebsiella pneumoniae
subsp. pneumoniae MGH 78578 (KPN), Yersinia pestis
CO92 (YPO), Yersinia pestis biovar Microtus str. 91001
(YP) and Actinobacillus succinogenes 130Z (ASuc) are
grouped together (lower half of Fig. 3B). They are all
Gram-negative strains with relatively higher GC contents.
Another group contains all kinds of clostridium, Bacillus
subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168, Staphylococcus epidermidis
ATCC 12228 (SE), Streptococcus suis 98HAH33 (SSU),
Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) (SCO), Listeria monocytogenes str. 4b F2365 (LMof) and Lactobacillus salivarius
(LSL), which are all Gram-positive strains. The phylogenetic tree in Fig. 3A also includes two main branches. The
upper one is the PTS II genes from the fructose/mannose/
sorbose family, while genes from the fructose/mannitol
family are in the lower half. Comparing the trees in

Figure 3 The Evolutionary model of the microbial PTS II system is proposed. (A) the phylogenetic tree built by using fructose/mannose/sorbose
and fructose/mannitol families of the PTS II ABC genes; (B) the 16sRNA tree of the studied microbial species.

Shi et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11(Suppl 11):S9
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105-11-S11

Figs. 3A and 3B, we can find that the PTS II genes from
Bacillus subtilis and clostridium strains are grouped
together with those from the Gram-negative strains which
we identified as the lower half in Fig. 3B. This supports
our hypothesis.
How the PTS II systems are evolved in Clostridium
beijerinckii NCIMB 8052?

The genome size of Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB
8052 is about 5.9MB, including 5104 ORFs. That is significantly larger than that of Clostridium acetobutylicum
ATCC 824, which has a chromosome of 3.94MB plus a
plasmid of 192KB [2], totaling 3917 ORFs (3739 on the
chromosome and 178 on the plasmid pSol1). This is
likely due to more diverse living environments enjoyed
by Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052, which means
more types of carbon sources it can utilize [1,3].
Although they are in the same genus of clostridium,
they separated relatively early in the evolutionary process [21]. Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 has
been shown acquiring large quantities of outside genes
through horizontal gene transfer [2]; Clostridium difficile
630 also has been found with as high as 11% of mobile
gene contents in its genome [17], which strongly indicates that it gained genes from other species. So, it is
reasonable to expect similar events happened in C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 too. But in its distintive evolutionary process, C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 is able to
keep large number of genes transferred from other species because it needs these genes to adapt to various soil
environments. On the other hand, the living condition
of C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 is relatively simpler, so
only fewer genes which are essential to its life activity
are kept. More specifically, C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052
is quite different from C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 in
terms of sugar needed. While C. acetobutylicum ATCC
824 is starch-based, C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 is
molasses-based. Molasses contains 35% of sucrose, 7%
of fructose and 5% of glucose (W. Jiang, personal communication). Also, C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 can ferment xylose degraded from agricultural wastes [22].
Since C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 can utilize more
sugar substrates than C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824, it
makes senses that it needs more genes to break down
these substrates. After querying the ISFinder database
(http://www-is.biotoul.fr/), we identified 92 different
types of insertion sequences in the C. beijerinckii
NCIMB 8052 genome, among them 19 with e-score
lower than 1e-5 (data not shown). A lot of these insertion sequences have multiple copies. For example,
ISCb1 [23] has 9 copies. In Clostridium perfringens,
some PTS genes are found to be flanked by insertion
sequences [24]. In C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052, we have
similar findings too. This is in agreement with our

Page 6 of 8

hypothesis that C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 genome
gained and kept large quantities of outside genes
through HGT, including some PTS genes.
Another reason which leads to the fact that there are
so many sets of the PTS II genes in the C. beijerinckii
NCIMB 8052 genome is gene duplication. As shown in
Figure 2, many PTS IIB genes have several close-related
copies. For example, Cbei3873 and Cbei4913, they are
95% identical. Figure 1 shows that they share the same
genetic organization and gene order. This strongly indicates that these genes are of great importance to the
host bacteria, so they are duplicated in group, as functional backups for the original ones.
The correlation between sugar utilization and PTS II gene
numbers

Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 can better utilize
fructose in the fermentation media than Clostridium
acetobutylicum ATCC 824 (W. Jiang, personal communication). Our findings have shown that in the Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 genome there are so
many more gene sets of PTS II fructose/mannose/sorbose family than C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824. And
with the consensus from previous reports [6] that all
gene sets of this family can transport fructose, we established a likely correlation between these facts.
In addition to the PTS system, fructokinase [25] can
also phosphorylate fructose into phospho-6-fructose.
However, fructokinase may not have played a major role
in determining the difference between the fructose utilization efficiencies of these two clostridium model
strains. In both genomes, there are two copies of fructokinase genes, Cbei3497 and Cbei5009 ;CAC0424 and
CAC1523.
It remains an unsolved question why these three
sugars, fructose, mannose and sorbose, can form such a
distinctive phosphotransferase family. In terms of their
chemical structures, all three are hexose, but fructose
and sorbose are ketoses while mannose is an aldose.
Probably they have very similar 3D structures. The presence of sugar isomerases around certain types of the
fructose/mannose/sorbose family PTS II genes in the
C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 genome seems to suggest
this too.

Conclusions
In summation of the analysis performed in this research ,
we found that the fructose/mannose/sorbose family of
PTS II genes in Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052
can be further classified into three groups , possibly corresponding to the three different sugar substrates of this
family. In addition to their respective specific sugars, all
of them are capable of transport fructose. It is highly
likely that this finding offers a valid explanation that

Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 can better utilize
fructose as the sole carbon source than Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824.
We also proposed an evolutionary model which suggests the horizontal gene transfer of the phosphotransferase system from higher GC microbial to lower GC
ones. This may help to illustrate the mechanism why
bacteria can survive in different environments through
their variable carbon sources.

Methods
Homology search

The amino acid sequences of the studied genes are used
as query, run blastp search [26] against the non-redundant (nr) database ,keep all the default parameters
values, and find their homologous genes in other
sequenced microbial species. E-value should be less than
1e-5.
Annotation of the PTS II genes

All three methods listed below are used for the accurate
annotation of the genes in the Clostridium beijerinckii
NCIMB 8052 genome and other studied genomes,
which are downloaded from the NCBI (http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/) RefSeq database.
(1) Blastp: described above.
(2) InterproScan [27] domain analysis: the amino acid
sequences are submitted to the EBI website of InterProScan (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/InterProScan/),
using all the default parameter values.
(3) The domain structures of the PTS II genes are
compared with those known variations of all the families
from the literatures.
Synteny analysis

For each sets of the PTS II genes, we first visually
inspect their downstream and upstream regions for possible existence of synteny. The amino acid sequences of
the 4 surrounding genes in both directions are picked
out to identify their domains through InterproScan.
They are used as the blastp queries to identify their
homologous genes in other microbial species (e-value
less than 1e-5). We then check the locations of these
homologous genes in their respective genomes to see
whether they also appear in the surrounding areas of
PTS II genes.
Multi-sequence alignment and construction of
phylogenetic trees

We use the embedded ClustalW [28] function of software package MEGA4 [29] for multisequence alignment,
using all default parameter values. NJ (Neighbor-Joining)
method [30] is applied to construct phylogenetic trees,
with bootstrap values [31] calculated by repeating 500

times to evaluate the robustness of the nodes on the
trees.
Additional file 1: We surveyed all the PTS genes in 7 species and listed
their domain structure, predicted families as well as the GC percentage
for each sets.
