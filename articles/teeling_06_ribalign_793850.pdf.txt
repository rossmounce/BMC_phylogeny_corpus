Abstract
Background: Until today, analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences has been the de-facto
gold standard for the assessment of phylogenetic relationships among prokaryotes. However, the
branching order of the individual phlya is not well-resolved in 16S rRNA-based trees. In search of
an improvement, new phylogenetic methods have been developed alongside with the growing
availability of complete genome sequences. Unfortunately, only a few genes in prokaryotic genomes
qualify as universal phylogenetic markers and almost all of them have a lower information content
than the 16S rRNA gene. Therefore, emphasis has been placed on methods that are based on
multiple genes or even entire genomes. The concatenation of ribosomal protein sequences is one
method which has been ascribed an improved resolution. Since there is neither a comprehensive
database for ribosomal protein sequences nor a tool that assists in sequence retrieval and
generation of respective input files for phylogenetic reconstruction programs, RibAlign has been
developed to fill this gap.
Results: RibAlign serves two purposes: First, it provides a fast and scalable database that has been
specifically adapted to eubacterial ribosomal protein sequences and second, it provides
sophisticated import and export capabilities. This includes semi-automatic extraction of ribosomal
protein sequences from whole-genome GenBank and FASTA files as well as exporting aligned,
concatenated and filtered sequence files that can directly be used in conjunction with the PHYLIP
and MrBayes phylogenetic reconstruction programs.
Conclusion: Up to now, phylogeny based on concatenated ribosomal protein sequences is
hampered by the limited set of sequenced genomes and high computational requirements.
However, hundreds of full and draft genome sequencing projects are on the way, and advances in
cluster-computing and algorithms make phylogenetic reconstructions feasible even with large
alignments of concatenated marker genes. RibAlign is a first step in this direction and may be
particularly interesting to scientists involved in whole genome sequencing of representatives of new
or sparsely studied eubacterial phyla. RibAlign is available at http://www.megx.net/ribalign

Background
Analysis of 16S ribosomal rRNA (rRNA) sequences is currently the de-facto gold standard for the assessment of
phylogenetic relationships among prokaryotes. There are
various reasons that have made the 16S rRNA gene the
first choice as a phylogenetic marker, such as the presence
of positions with different evolutionary rates, its universal
occurrence within prokaryotes, its reasonable information
content, a length that was suitable for complete sequencing when the technique started, knowledge about its secondary structure that helps with alignments and finally
the presence of a comprehensive database of more than
hundred thousand sequences [1]. With ARB [2], there is
also a well-curated 16S rRNA database with a curated
alignment and a program suite for phylogenetic reconstructions available that has gained broad acceptance
among scientists worldwide.
Despite this success, trees based on 16S rRNA sequences
lack resolution when it comes to elucidating the branching order of individual phyla [3]. This limits our understanding of early evolutionary splits within the
prokaryotes and the degree of relatedness among individual phyla, of which some have been proposed to build
super-clusters [4,5]. These issues still are matters of sometimes heated debates [6,7]. It is possible that particularly
early evolution can never be fully determined because an
early evolutionary boundary limits the attainable resolution. The cause for this boundary might be either (a)
methodological and caused by the limited information
content (i.e. mutational saturation) of single marker
genes, or (b) fundamental and caused by extensive lateral
gene transfer (LGT) among early prokaryotes [8-10].
Before the genomic revolution, it had been anticipated
that the wealth of information from entire genomes
would lead to a refined view on the tree of life. Consequently, the ever-growing availability of complete
genome sequences has propelled the development of new
phylogenetic methods. Some of these methods exploit
information from entire genomes whereas others use only
a subset. Examples are super-tree approaches that combine individual trees [11,12], methods based on comparisons of genes between organisms (shared gene content
[13-16], shared gene order [15], similarities of protein
folds and domains [17,18]), methods based on intrinsic
DNA-signatures (e.g. skewed oligonucleotide distributions) [19] and concatenations of marker genes [4,20-27].
It is one of the big disillusions of the post-genomic era,
that most of these methods fail to provide an advantage in
resolution over 16S rRNA-based trees [5]. Instead, comparative genomics revealed an extent of LGT that seriously
questions the applicability of the eukaryotic species concept to the world of the prokaryotes. As a result, today the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/66

tree of life must be regarded as a complex network of vertical and horizontal inheritance. The extent to which tree
reconstruction is affected by LGT is still a matter of debate
[28]. It has been argued that a subset of the genes, including those encoding (most) ribosomal proteins, are less
likely to undergo LGT and that for these core genes a phylogeny can be reliably inferred [28-31]. Whether such a
stable genetic core really exists is hard to prove and hence
discussed controversially [8,11,12]. Its existence is supported by the fact that phylogenetic analysis of alleged
core genes in general support the 16S-derived three
domain concept and mostly also correlate with 16S rRNA
analysis in detail – a congruence that is notably absent
form most non-core genes [30]. From the core genes,
ribosomal proteins are of particular interest because their
tight interactions with the 16S and other rRNAs suggests
co-evolution of these molecules. Moreover, concatenation
of ribosomal protein sequences is one of the few methods
that has been ascribed an enhanced resolution [5]. This is
also reflected in a variety of publications on phylogenetic
reconstructions that are based on this method [4,2025,27].
As of this writing (May 2005), 224 completely sequenced
eubacterial genomes are available to the public. Hence,
the data set available for comparison of ribosomal protein
sequences is sparse when compared to the vast amount of
available 16S rRNA sequences. On the other hand, most
of the known phyla have been covered by at least one
sequenced representative, and the gaps are being filled
quickly. In addition, most draft genome sequences contain most if not all of the ribosomal proteins, so that the
method is not necessarily restricted to fully closed
genomes.

Implementation
RibAlign has been implemented in a fully object-oriented
manner with REALbasic [32] and uses the high-performance Valentina object-relational database engine [33] to
store sequences and related information.
New sequences can be imported from whole-genome
GenBank or FASTA files. An automated screening of the
annotated gene descriptions and gene names assists in the
extraction of the ribosomal proteins before writing them
to the database. The database and importer has currently
been designed for the extraction and storage of sequences
from Eubacteria, but future releases of RibAlign might
include archaeal ribosomal protein sequences as well.
RibAlign can not only export sequences to plain FASTA
format, but also has a complete built-in pipeline for generating processed input files for the PHYLIP [34] and
MrBayes [35,36] phylogenetic reconstruction programs.
This pipeline comprises exporting dedicated multi-

Figure 1 maximum-likelihood tree based on concatenated ribosomal proteins for 120 eubacterial species
Unrooted
Unrooted maximum-likelihood tree based on concatenated ribosomal proteins for 120 eubacterial species. The following 37
sequences were concatenated: RplABCDFIJKLMNOPQRSTUVW, RpmA, RpsBCDEFGHIKLMOQRST, filter by a 40% positional conservation filter resulting in 5182 amino acid positions. The tree was calculated from this alignment using the ProML
program of the PLYLIPackage (settings: best tree search mode; JTT model of amino acid substitution; one category of sites with
a constant evolutionary rate; no weights; rough-type of analysis with global rearrangements). Bootstrapping was carried out
with 100 replicates. Numbers in parentheses refer to the numbers of species that make up the respective branch.

headed FASTA files for a selectable subset of ribosomal
proteins, alignment of the exported sequences independently for each gene, concatenation of the individual alignments into a single alignment, filtering of the lessconserved positions according to an adjustable threshold
and finally conversion to PHYLIP or NEXUS format.
RibAlign does not implement its own alignment algorithm but instead uses the MAFFT program [37], which
can generate high-quality alignments with good speed
even when used with larger sets of sequences. MAFFT is
not part of RibAlign's distribution and thus has to be
obtained and installed separately [38].
RibAlign comprises a searchable, tutorial-like online help
that provides detailed information on all of the program's
features.
We expect the implementation of RibAlign and the underlying database to perform nicely with the upcoming flood

of genome sequences, since it has been tested with 10,000
artificial entries. The current release of RibAlign requires
Mac OS X and as of this writing, no decisions on possible
ports to other platforms have been made. Contributions
concerning this matter are welcome.
RibAlign is freely available for academic applications and
can be downloaded from its website [39], which also provides screenshots of RibAlign's user interface.

Results and discussion
Construction and quality of the RibAlign data set
RibAlign is bundled with an example database (RibAlignDB) that contains the ribosomal protein sequences of
184 of the publicly available complete eubacterial
genome sequences. This data set has been generated by
importing the respective GenBank files, followed by some
manual curation. The latter comprised shifting N-termini
of sequences, deleting false paralogs, cross-checking of
dubious annotations by InterPro [40] searches and in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/66

some cases re-annotation of falsely annotated ribosomal
proteins. Despite these efforts, RibAlign's data set can by
no means be regarded as well-curated. Like all genome
annotations, it does contain errors. Thus, data should be
checked carefully prior to using it for phylogenetic reconstructions. Archaea are currently not included, since (a) so
far only 22 complete genome sequences of Archaea are
publicly available (b) the monophyletic nature of the
Archaea is under discussion [41] and most important (c)
joint data set of eubacterial and archaeal sequences produce less reliable alignments due to differences in ribosome composition between both domains [42].

today's 16S rRNA phylogeny is likely, where a de novo tree
based on all available sequences cannot be computed any
more.

In summary, RibAlignDB provides a good starting point
for scientists who are interested in phylogenetic reconstructions based on concatenated ribosomal protein
sequence. Sequences from future genome sequences can
be added relatively easy due to RibAlign's powerful
import filters.

The corresponding MrBayes tree showed the same topology (data not shown). Posterior probabilities computed
from 13,000 trees showed good support for several of the
earlier proposed super-clades, namely affiliation of Actinobacteria and Cyanobacteria [4], of Chlamydiae and Planctomycetes [20], and of Chlorobi and Bacteroidetes [43].
However, good statistical node support does not preclude
tree reconstruction artifacts [44]. For example, different
evolutionary rates might lead to artificial clustering of
fast-evolving species due to long branch attraction. In
addition, a common thermophilic lifestyle like that of
Aquifex aeolicus VF5 and Thermotoga maritima MSB8T is
likely to impose similar constraints on amino acid composition and thus could cause an artificial clustering of
these organisms. There are indeed indications that support an affiliation of Aquifex aeolicus VF5 with the Proteobacteria rather than with Thermotoga maritima MSB8T [45].
Likewise, the association of the Actinobacteria and Cyanobacteria might be influenced by a biased amino acid composition as well [21].

Computational requirements
Phylogenetic reconstructions based on large alignments
are very hardware-demanding, especially when likelihood-based methods are used in conjunction with resampling techniques. Even with the few available genomes
today, concatenated alignments of ribosomal proteins
sequences can easily exceed one million individual positions. Therefore, a selection in species and sequences has
to be made for the more CPU-intensive treeing methods.

The MrBayes1 phylogenetic reconstruction program is fast
since it is optimized for speed. However, this speed comes
at the price of high memory requirements. As an example,
a tree for 120 species and 5182 amino acid positions was
calculated within a few days on a dual 3.0 GHz Xeon
machine, but the calculation required 8 GB of main memory even when only two chains were used (tree not
shown). Thus, larger data sets require either more memory or an MPI-aware cluster running the MPI-version of
MrBayes.
The PHYLIP package2 is comprised of programs for different kinds of phylogenetic analysis. For a bootstrapped
maximum-likelihood tree with ProML, raw computing
power is the limiting factor. As an example (Figure 1), a
ProML run with 100 replicates for the above-mentioned
data set (120 species with 5182 amino-acid positions
each) took more than three months to compute on a tennode cluster of dual 2.8 GHz Xeon processors (with each
node calculating ten trees). Future improvements in processor speed and the growing use of cluster computing in
bioinformatics will hopefully keep up with the increasing
computational demand. However, since the computational requirements increase progressively with alignment
size and the number of species, a situation like with

Tree topology
In the above-mentioned maximum likelihood tree calculated from concatenated ribosomal protein subunit
sequences, all major phyla are well resolved (Figure 1).
The topology is in good agreement with the widely
accepted 16S rRNA-derived topology and also with a
recently published tree based on concatenated ribosomal
proteins subunit sequences [23].

A more in-depth discussion of the tree topology is beyond
the scope of this paper. A much more detailed version of
the ProML tree, showing all 120 species, can be obtained
from the RibAlign website [39].
Applicability
The applicability of phylogenetic reconstructions based
on concatenated ribosomal proteins sequences has been
discussed elsewhere in detail [20]. As with all proteinbased phylogenies, concatenation of protein sequences
has to face the problems of LGT and paralogy. LGT has
been reported for some of the ribosomal protein encoding
genes [46,47] and others do not qualify as makers because
they have paralogs or are not universally present in all
eubacteria. In addition, individual proteins in a concatenated alignment might evolve at different speeds, which
requires the applications of more sophisticated likelihood-based models to account for this type of sequence
heterogeneity [48]. Finally, site selection can have an
impact on the positions of weakly supported branches of
the inferred trees [20,25].

To be fair, most of these problems apply to the 16S rRNA
approach as well. LGT of 16S rRNA genes is possible [49]
and has been reported [50,51]. In addition, most bacteria
have paralogs of the 16S rRNA gene that can differ considerably [52]. Also site selection has a major impact on the
tree topology of 16S rRNA-based trees as well [6].

Authors' contributions
In the end, all trees that have been published so far based
on concatenated ribosomal protein sequences are remarkably similar and mostly agree with the currently accepted
16S rRNA-based tree topology.

RibAlign was implemented by HT. FOG contributed
important ideas regarding features, implementation,
tested the program and was involved in the writing of the

Conclusion

Note

Since the genomic revolution started in 1995 with the
complete sequencing of Haemophilus influenzae Rd KW20
[53], new genomes are being sequenced at an exponentially increasing rate. This enables for new approaches in
bacterial phylogeny that try to exploit a larger proportion
from the genomic information for tree reconstruction
than just single marker genes. To use such methods in an
effective manner, a specialized and curated database of all
potential marker genes from all genomes would be desirable.

1MrBayes

RibAlign is a step in this direction for eubacterial ribosomal protein subunit sequences. We hope that it will be a
helpful tool for scientists involved in whole genome
sequencing of Eubacteria, particularly with regard to the
phylogeny of representatives of new or only sparsely studied phyla.
