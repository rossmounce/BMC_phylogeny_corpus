Abstract
Background: Bet v 1 is an important cause of hay fever in northern Europe. Bet v 1 isoforms from
the European white birch (Betula pendula) have been investigated extensively, but the allergenic
potency of other birch species is unknown. The presence of Bet v 1 and closely related PR-10 genes
in the genome was established by amplification and sequencing of alleles from eight birch species
that represent the four subgenera within the genus Betula. Q-TOF LC-MSE was applied to identify
which PR-10/Bet v 1 genes are actually expressed in pollen and to determine the relative
abundances of individual isoforms in the pollen proteome.
Results: All examined birch species contained several PR-10 genes. In total, 134 unique sequences
were recovered. Sequences were attributed to different genes or pseudogenes that were, in turn,
ordered into seven subfamilies. Five subfamilies were common to all birch species. Genes of two
subfamilies were expressed in pollen, while each birch species expressed a mixture of isoforms
with at least four different isoforms. Isoforms that were similar to isoforms with a high IgEreactivity (Bet v 1a = PR-10.01A01) were abundant in all species except B. lenta, while the
hypoallergenic isoform Bet v 1d (= PR-10.01B01) was only found in B. pendula and its closest
relatives.
Conclusion: Q-TOF LC-MSE allows efficient screening of Bet v 1 isoforms by determining the
presence and relative abundance of these isoforms in pollen. B. pendula contains a Bet v 1-mixture
in which isoforms with a high and low IgE-reactivity are both abundant. With the possible exception
of B. lenta, isoforms identical or very similar to those with a high IgE-reactivity were found in the
pollen proteome of all examined birch species. Consequently, these species are also predicted to
be allergenic with regard to Bet v 1 related allergies.

Background
Birch trees grow in the temperate climate zone of the
northern hemisphere and release large amounts of pollen

during spring. This pollen is a major cause of Type I allergies. The main birch allergen in northern Europe is a
pathogenesis-related class 10 (PR-10) protein from the

PR-10 proteins are present as a multigene family in many
higher plants, including Gymnosperms as well as Monocots and Dicots [21-23]. The classification as PR-proteins
[24] is based on the induced expression in response to
pathogen infections by viruses, bacteria or fungi [25-27],
to wounding [28] or to abiotic stress [29,30]. Some members of the PR-10 gene family are constitutively expressed
during plant development [31] or expressed in specific tissues [23]. Multiple PR-10 genes have been reported for B.
pendula as well [32]. mRNAs of these genes have been
detected in various birch tissues, including pollen
[1,33,34], roots, leaves [28,30], and in cells that are grown
in a liquid medium in the presence of microbial pathogens [27]. PR-10 genes share a high sequence similarity
and form a homogeneous group. Homogeneity is
believed to be maintained by concerted evolution [35].
Arrangements of PR-10 genes into clusters, such as found
for Mal d 1 genes in apple, may facilitate concerted evolution [22].

Knowledge on the allergenicity of birch species may facilitate selection and breeding of hypoallergenic birch trees.
To investigate the presence and abundance of Bet v 1 isoforms in Betula species that are potential crossing material, we: (I) cloned and sequenced PR-10 alleles from eight
representative Betula species to detect PR-10 genes at the
genomic level, (II) applied Q-TOF LC-MSE to identify the
pollen-expressed Bet v 1 genes, (III) determined relative
abundances of isoforms in the pollen proteome, and (IV)
compared these isoforms to isoforms with a known IgEreactivity.



The genus Betula encompasses over 30 tree and shrub species that are found in diverse habitats in the boreal and
temperate climate zone of the Northern Hemisphere. The
taxonomy of the Betula genus is debated, as is the number
of recognized species. The genus is either divided into
three, four or five groups or subgenera [11-13]. B. pendula
occurs in Europe and is the only species whose relation to
birch pollen allergy has been extensively investigated.
Sensitization to birch pollen is also reported across Asia
and North America, where B. pendula is not present
[14,15]. Other Betula species occur in these areas, but their
allergenic potency is unknown. Betula species may vary in
their allergenicity as variation in allergenicity has been
found among cultivars of apple [16-18], peach and nectarine [19], and among olive trees [20].

tion, but has the additional advantage of being able to
determine relative abundances of peptides in a single run
[39]. By quantifying isoforms with a known IgE-reactivity
[37], the allergenicity of particular birch trees can be predicted. The existence of allergenic and hypoallergenic isoforms indicates that PR-10 isoforms vary in allergenicity,
and some PR-10 isoforms do not bind IgE at all. This has
already been demonstrated for two truncated Bet v 1 isoforms [33]. Therefore, not all PR-10 isoforms are necessarily isoallergens.



European white birch (Betula pendula) termed Bet v 1
[1,2]. Pollen of other Fagales species contains PR-10
homologues that share epitopes with Bet v 1 [3], as do several fruits, nuts and vegetables [4-7]. An IgE-mediated
cross-reaction to these food homologues causes the socalled oral allergy syndrome (OAS) [8,9]. PR-10 proteins
constitute the largest group of aeroallergens and are
among the four most common food allergens [10].

Several Bet v 1 isoforms have been described for B. pendula
[1,32-34,36], including both allergenic and hypoallergenic isoforms [37]. Individual B. pendula trees have the
genetic background to produce a mixture of Bet v 1 isoforms with varying IgE-reactivity [32]. The relative abundance of individual isoforms at the protein level will
influence the allergenicity of the pollen. Molecular masses
and sequences of tryptic peptides from Bet v 1 can be
determined by Q-TOF MS/MS [38]. The recently developed Q-TOF LC-MSE method enables peptide identifica-

The number of clones sequenced in both directions and the number of identified sequences and genes are shown per species.1 Subfamily 01 to 05 were previously identified
[32], while subfamily 06 and 07 are new. Homology to mRNA sequences suggests that subfamily 01 and 02 are expressed in pollen.
*1 Species were diploid (2n) as measured by flow cytometry. The identification of alleles of a single gene is based on the criterion of having > 98.5% sequence similarity, and by
allowing maximally two alleles per gene.
*2 Genes identified in B. pendula [32].

facts were excluded by combining information from independent PCRs. The Open Reading Frames (ORF) of the
sequences were highly conserved, making the alignment
straightforward. The consensus sequence of the exon had
452 positions excluding the 31 bps in the primer regions.
228 out of the 274 variable consensus positions were phylogenetically informative. The sequences grouped into
seven well-supported clusters in the Neighbor Joining
(NJ) tree (Fig. 2). Five clusters coincided with the division
between subfamilies as found in B. pendula [32]. Two new
subfamilies (06 and 07) were identified, which occurred
only in two species, contrary to the previously described
subfamilies 01 to 05 that were found in all species (Table
1). In all sequences, an intron was located between the
first and second nucleotide of codon 62. This intron was
highly variable in length and composition, which was an
additional characteristic for inferring the proper subfamily. Intron sequences were excluded from the phenetic/phylogenetic analysis because introns evolve at a
different speed compared to exons.
PR-10 sequences and genes
We recovered 12 to 25 unique PR-10 sequences per species, adding up to 146 sequences in total (Table 1). Out of
the 134 unique sequences, over 100 sequences have never
been described before. B. pendula, B. plathyphylla and B.
populifolia are closely related members of the subgenus
Betula and consequently had multiple alleles in common.
These species shared one allele with B. costata, which is
another member of the subgenus Betula. We applied a pre-

defined cut-off level of 98.5% to attribute all sequences to
different genes, while allowing maximally two alleles per
gene per species. These criteria coincided in the majority
of cases, but several genes of B. chichibuensis in the large
cluster in subfamily 03 and of B. lenta in subfamily 02,
and the genes 02A/02B and 03C/03D in B. pendula were
more than 98.5% similar. Table 1 shows the total number
of identified PR-10 genes per species. Out of the 13 genes
that have previously been identified in B. pendula (Table
1; Fig. 2), 11 genes were recovered from the newly
sequenced B. pendula cultivar 'Youngii'. This study identified no new genes in this cultivar. This indicates that the
majority of genes has been recovered by sequencing over
100 clones per species, and that only a small number of
genes might be missing in the dataset.
Homologues of the PR-10 genes of B. pendula were identified in B. populifolia and B. plathyphylla. Sequences from
these species were labeled according to the procedure
described by Gao et al. [22] that was previously used for B.
pendula [32]. These labels consist of the subfamily's
number, followed by a letter for each distinct gene, then a
number for each unique protein variant and an additional
number referring to silent mutations. When applicable,
an additional letter indicates variations in the intron. The
PR-10 genes in B. costata displayed a considerable degree
of homology to the genes in B. pendula, but differentiating
homologues and paralogues was not always possible. It
was not possible to differentiate between homologues
and paralogues of the PR-10 genes in B. lenta, B chichibuen-

sis, B. nigra, and B. schmidtii. Rather than developing a separate denomination scheme for each species, we labeled
sequences with the PR-10 subfamily number, followed by
a number for each unique protein variant and an additional number referring to silent mutations. This facilitates the protein analysis which distinguishes protein
variants rather than separate alleles or genes.
The PR-10 gene copy number varied between different
birch species. This is caused by evolutionary processes
such as duplication, extinction, and recombination. The
overall clustering pattern appears to reflect a combination
of such events. Genes from the same species tend to group
close to each other on several positions in the NJ tree (Fig.
2). Examples are the clusters of highly similar sequences
from B. costata in subfamily 01 and from B. chichibuensis
in subfamily 03, which either reflect unequal crossingover, gene conversion or duplication events. The B. populifolia genome harbors two clear examples of unequal
crossing-over. Allele 01E01.01 is a recombination
between the 01A gene and the 01B gene. The first part
matches exactly to allele 01A01.01, while the second part
differs by 1 SNP from 01B01.01 with position 267 of the
ORF as the point of recombination. Both original genes
were also present. Similarly, allele 03E01.01 is a recombination between the 03B gene and the 03D gene. In this
case, the recombination probably occurred without gene
duplication, since the original 03B gene, as present in B.
pendula, was absent.
PR-10 protein predictions
Not all PR-10 alleles will be expressed as a full-sized protein. 112 unique sequences had an intact ORF, while the
remaining 22 sequences contain early stop codons or
indels in the ORF that result in frame shifts followed by an
early stop codon. The latter sequences were denoted as
pseudogenes, although it cannot be excluded that these
sequences produce truncated proteins. We calculated Ka/
Ks ratios within each subfamily. The suspected pseudogenes displayed higher Ka/Ks ratios than the alleles with an

intact ORF in the subfamilies 01, 02 and 03 (Table 2). This
points to an alleviated selection pressure in the pseudogenes. The other PR-10 subfamilies do not contain sufficient numbers of both genes and pseudogenes to perform
this comparison. The majority of sequences had 5' splicing sites of AG:GT and 3' splicing sites of AG:GC, AG:GT
or AG:GA, which is in concordance with known motifs for
plant introns. Notable exceptions were: an AC:GT (B.
schmidtii, 01pseudo04) and an AG:AT (B. nigra,
04var05.01a) 5' splicing site, an AC:GC (B. schmidtii,
01pseudo04) and a TG:GC (B. nigra, 02pseudo04) 3'
splicing site, and two deletions (B. costata, 01pseudo05
and 02pseudo01) at the 3' end of the intron. Except for
the AG:AT splicing site, all exceptions belonged to
sequences that were denoted as pseudogenes, providing
additional evidence for these designations.
Depending on the subfamily, Ka/Ks ratios ranged from
0.09 to 0.36 for sequences with an intact ORF (Table 2),
indicating strong purifying selection. The PR-10 alleles in
birch encode a putative protein that consists of 160 amino
acids, yielding a relative molecular mass of approximately
17 kDa. The only exception is 01var17.01 in B. chichibuensis, which contains an indel that results in the deletion of
two amino acids. The allelic variation is lower at the protein level than at the nucleic acid level, which is consistent
with the low Ka/Ks ratios. Hence, the 112 unique genomic
sequences encode 80 unique isoforms. The PR-10.05 gene
is an extreme example for which only four putative isoforms are predicted, despite the presence of 14 allelic variants. One of these isoforms is predicted in all species
except B. nigra. Parts of the PR-10 protein sequences are
highly conserved, as is demonstrated in the amino-acid
alignment of five PR-10 isoforms (one per subfamily)
from B. pendula (Fig. 3). The most prominent region lies
between Glu42 and Ile56 and contains only a single amino
acid variation among all 80 isoforms. A phosphate-binding loop with the sequence motive GxGGxGx characterizes this region. Additional conserved Glycine residues are
present at positions 88, 89, 92, 110 and 111.

Bet v 1 expression in pollen
The presence of Bet v 1-like proteins was examined in pollen of B. nigra, B. chichibuensis, B. lenta, B. costata and B.
pendula 'Youngii'. Pollen proteins were solubilized in an
aqueous buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Each sample
displayed an intense protein band after CBB-staining at
the expected molecular mass of Bet v 1, between 16–18
kDa (Fig. 4), while other intense bands were visible at 28
kDa and 35 kDa. No 16–18 kDa band was visible when
the pellet that remained after extraction was separated by
SDS-PAGE (not shown), indicating the efficiency of the
extraction procedure with regard to Bet v 1.

To establish the identity of the proteins in the 16–18 kDa
band, we cut out this band from the lane of B. pendula
(Fig. 4) and performed in-gel digestion with trypsin. QTOF LC-MS/MS analysis of the tryptic peptides yielded
multiple Bet v 1 isoforms (details given below). The bands
just above and below the 16–18 kDa band were also
sequenced and checked for the presence of Bet v 1. The
lower band at 14 kDa contained birch profilin (Bet v 2;
GenBank AAA16522; 2 peptides, coverage 24%) and contained no Bet v 1 fragments. The higher band at 19 kDa
contained birch cyclophilin (Bet v 7; CAC841116; 3 peptides, coverage 28%) and some minor traces of Bet v 1 (Bet
v 1a; CAA33887; 1 peptide, coverage 14%). Bollen et al.

Analysis of Bet v 1 isoforms by Q-TOF LC-MSE
The tryptic digests of the 16–18 kDa bands were examined
in detail to elucidate the expression of separate Bet v 1 isoforms in pollen. Trypsin cleaves proteins exclusively at the
C-terminus of Arginine and Lysine. Fig. 3 shows an example of the fragments I to XVII that are theoretically formed
after tryptic digestion of isoforms from the subfamilies 01
to 05. Isoforms of different subfamilies can be discriminated by several fragments on the basis of peptide mass
and sequence. The number of discriminating fragments
becomes lower for Bet v 1 isoforms within a subfamily. A
new mass spectrometric technique called Q-TOF LC-MSE
allows simultaneous identification and quantification of
peptides (see Method section for details). A distinct feature of the LC-MSE procedure is that information is
obtained for all peptides. This contrasts MS/MS, in which
a subset of peptides is selected for fragmentation. A software program analyses the data, while using a search database for interpretation of the fragmentation spectra. This

database contained the sequence information of all PR-10
isoforms described in this paper and of previously
described PR-10 isoforms from B. pendula [32].
The LC-MSE results indicated that PR-10 proteins of subfamily 01 and 02 are expressed in the pollen of the five
examined birch species. We found no evidence for the
expression of genes from subfamilies 03 to 07 in pollen.
For example, we identified 22 Bet v 1 peptide fragments in
B. pendula (Table 3), all of which were predicted from the
gDNA sequences. Eight detected peptides could distinguish between isoforms of subfamily 01 and 02. The B.
pendula genome contains seven genes from subfamily 01
and 02. The expression of four of these (01A, 01B, 01C,
02C) was confirmed (Table 3). Sequence coverage of the
expressed isoforms amounted to 71 to 79% (Table 3).
Four peptides were specific for isoform 01B01, while one
peptide was specific for isoform 02C01. Two peptides
were specific for both isoforms of gene 01A, while two
others were specific for both isoforms of gene 01C. Isoforms 02A01 and 02B01 could not be separated, so either
one or both of them are expressed. Table 3 also shows the
peptide fragments that were long enough to be detected in
the tryptic digest, but were not observed. Information on
absent fragments can be used to exclude expression of particular isoforms, such as isoform 01D01 in B. pendula.
Altogether, at least 4 to 6 isoforms were expressed in each
of the five examined species. In total, the presence of

unique peptides confirmed the expression of 14 isoforms
among the five species in total (Table 3). An additional 15
isoforms lacked one or more unique peptides to distinguish them from other isoforms or from each other, but
several of these must be expressed. The expression of five
isoforms was ruled out, because multiple unique peptides
from these variants were lacking from the peptide mixture. Two identified peptides in B. costata and one peptide
from B. nigra did not match to any sequence that was
recovered from these species. These peptides belong to
"unknown isoforms" (Table 3) and this indicates that the
sequences that encode these isoforms are missing from
the dataset. Finally, conflicting evidence was found for
expression of the isoforms 01var10 and 01var11 in B.
lenta. Two peptides that were unique for these isoforms
were detected, while three peptides that were expected if
the isoforms would be expressed were lacking. Expression
of an allele that is missing from our dataset is a more
likely explanation than the expression of 01var10 or
01var11.
Quantification by Q-TOF LC-MSE
We determined the relative amounts of individual Bet v 1
isoforms in pollen from B. pendula 'Youngii' (Table 4).
This information can be deduced from the peak intensities of Bet v 1 peptides in the tryptic digest. Not all identified fragments can be used for quantification, because the
peak detection algorithm groups peaks with highly similar
masses and retention times together, also when they
might belong to different fragments. For example, fragment Ia (1854,91 Da) and VIIa (1854,89 Da) have a retention time that is marginally different, causing a strong
overlap in peak area. The relative amounts of two isoforms could be estimated directly: peptide IIIf is unique
for isoform 02C01 and comprises 17% of all fragment IIIvariants, while peptides IIIb and Xb are unique for 01B01
and comprise 18–19% of all fragment III and X-variants.
The isoforms 02A01 and 02B01 could not be separated,
but together they comprise 13% of the mixture based on
fragment IIIe. The relative amounts of the other isoforms
were estimated indirectly. Isoform 01A06 and 01B01
share fragment Vb, which comprises 23% of all fragment
V-variants. 01A06 is thus estimated to comprise 4–5% of
the mixture. The ratio between 01B01 and 01C04 plus
01C05 can be deduced from fragment Ib. 01C04 plus
01C05 are thus estimated to comprise 6% of the mixture.
This leaves 40–41% of the total amount of Bet v 1 for isoform 01A01.

Isoform 01A01 is identical to isoform Bet v 1a, which had
the highest IgE-reactivity in several tests performed by Ferreira et al. [37]. Pollen of B. costata, B. nigra and B. chichibuensis contained isoforms that are highly similar to Bet v
1a and differ by only 1–3 amino acids from this isoform.
We determined the expression of individual Bet v 1 iso-

Each isoform is displayed on a separate line. When isoforms are encoded by the same gene this is indicated in the third column. Note that gene labels in one species do not
correspond to gene labels in other species. Peptide fragments are shown at the top of the table and are labelled with Roman numbers as indicated in Fig. 3. Each variant of
these fragments is displayed in the Table by a letter. Bold capital letters indicate that a fragment is unique for the isoforms of a particular gene. Bold italic letters indicate that
a fragment is unique for the isoforms of a particular subfamily. Letters displayed between brackets indicate that a particular fragment was predicted, but was absent in the PR10 mixture. Finally, the last column displays the coverage of the total protein sequence, including the fragments that were too small to be detected (II, VI, IX, XI, XII, XIII, XIV,
XV). Fig. 3 displays the representative amino acid sequences of the isoforms 01A01 and 02A01.
*1 The isoforms in subfamily 03 to 05 were summarized into a single row and not displayed for the other species, because specific peptides were not detected in any of the
species.
*2 Fragments Xa and Xg have exactly the same mass and cannot be distinguished. The peak of peptide Xc overlaps with the first isotope peak of peptide Xa = g because they
differ exactly 1 Da in size and have the same charge. As a consequence, Xc cannot be identified separately.
*3 The XVI-peptides are not always detected because of their small size.

forms in a similar fashion as reported for B. pendula. The
Bet v 1a-like isoforms were estimated to comprise 38% (B.
chichibuensis), 36–44% (B. nigra) and 36–41% (B. costata)
of the total amount of Bet v 1. B. lenta differed from the
other species, because the isoform with the highest similarity to Bet v 1a differed by seven amino acids. This isoform was estimated to comprise 12–19% of the total
amount of Bet v 1. The expression of subfamily 01 isoforms relative to subfamily 02 isoforms was another
major difference between B. lenta and the other species. In
B. lenta, subfamily 02 accounted for 74–83% of the total
amount of Bet v 1, compared to 25–40% in B. pendula, B.
nigra and B. chichibuensis and 49–56% in B. costata.

Discussion
PR-10 gene family organization and evolution
The presence and diversity of Bet v 1 and closely related
PR-10 genes in eight birch species was established by
amplification and sequencing of more than 100 clones
per species. The eight species belong to four different subgenera/groups in the genus Betula [13] and thereby represent a large part of the existing variation within the genus.
Each birch species contains PR-10 genes, as could be
expected given the broad range of plant species in which
PR-10 genes are found [21-23]. The PR-10 genes grouped
into subfamilies, as previously reported for B. pendula
[32]. Five subfamilies were recovered from all species.
Two new subfamilies were identified, but these were each

restricted to two species and were mostly composed of
pseudogenes.
The PR-10 subfamily has a complex genomic organization. Differentiating between paralogues and homologues
was not possible beyond closely related species. One
likely explanation is concerted evolution, for which cladistic evidence was found (Fig. 2). Concerted evolution
causes genes to evolve as a single unit whose members
(occasionally) exchange genetic information through
gene conversion or unequal crossing-over [40]. Tandemly
arranged genes have increased conversion rates, while
such an arrangement is a prerequisite for the occurrence of
unequal crossing-over [41]. Most PR-10 genes in apple are
arranged in a duplicated cluster [22], thus facilitating the
main mechanisms for concerted evolution. We obtained
two alleles that appear the direct result of unequal crossing-over between Bet v 1 genes. On a higher taxonomic
level, cladistic evidence for concerted evolution is present
in the overall gene tree of the PR-10 family [35], as
sequence divergence is generally smaller between different genes from the same species than between genes from
different species.
Nei and Rooney [42] suggested that a combination of
recent gene duplications and purifying selection could
also explain why tandem gene duplicates appear similar.
In their model of birth-and-death evolution of genes, new
genes arise due to gene duplications, evolve independ-

ently while undergoing purifying selection, and go extinct
after becoming non-functional. Pseudogenes are characteristic for this process. The low Ka/Ks ratios clearly point
to the occurrence of purifying selection. Pseudogenes are
a common feature among the PR-10 genes in birch, since
we recovered them from six out of eight species. As much
as one-third of the recovered alleles in B. nigra had an
interrupted ORF. We did not determine the potential
expression of these alleles, since truncated isoforms
would have migrated outside the 16–18 kDa band in the
SDS-PAGE. None were, however, detected in the 14 kDa
band. Basically, all ingredients for the "birth-and-death"
model are present, except that independent evolution is
questionable due to the presences of duplicates that
resulted from unequal crossing-over. Moreover, the clustering of for example the B. chichibuensis alleles (Fig. 2)
would suggest an extremely high number of recent duplications. Both processes of "birth-and-death" and concerted evolution may, therefore, be active in the PR-10
gene family. Regardless of the evolutionary processes, its
outcome is clear: PR-10 proteins are homogenous as a
group and even stronger so within subfamilies. The high
homogeneity allowed us to use Q-TOF LC-MSE to quantify
the relative expression of separate Bet v 1 isoforms,
because large differences in amino acid composition
would have distorted the quantification.
Bet v 1 expression
Which PR-10 genes are actually expressed in pollen and
are thereby the true Bet v 1 allergens? We used Q-TOF
analysis to investigate the expression of Bet v 1 isoforms
in pollen of five Betula species. Isoforms from subfamily
01 and 02 were identified in birch pollen, confirming predictions based on mRNA expression [1,33,34]. The single
gene in subfamily 05 that was present in all eight birch
species, is homologous to ãpr10c, which has a high basal
transcription level in roots and a relatively lower basal
transcription level in leaves [27,28,43]. Its expression is
induced by copper stress [30] and during senescence in
leaves [44]. Regarding subfamily 03, the genes PR-10.03C
and 03D (= γpr10a and γpr10b) in B. pendula become transcriptionally upregulated upon infection of the leaves
with fungal pathogens [27]. Their transcription is induced
by wounding or auxin treatment in roots [28,43]. No data
have been reported about the expression of the sequenced
PR-10 genes in subfamilies 04, 06 and 07.

The pollen-expressed Bet v 1 genes are transcribed during
the late stages of anther development [45], but which factors induce transcription is unknown. Bet v 1 is an abundant pollen protein that has been estimated to encompass
10% of the total protein in B. pendula pollen [46]. The Bet
v 1 band was the most intense band in the SDS-PAGE gels
of birch pollen extracts. Its exact abundance is difficult to
estimate due to differences in extraction efficiency

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/24

between different proteins. However, given the low
amount of residual protein in the pellet, our results suggest that the abundance of Bet v 1 is higher than 10% of
the total protein content and is likely to exceed 20%. The
occurrence of Bet v 1 isoforms in B. pendula has previously
been studied in a mixture of pollen from different trees by
Swoboda et al. [34]. They analyzed tryptic digests of purified Bet v 1 isoforms by Plasma Desorption Mass Spectrometry (PDMS), a technique that only reveals peptide
masses. We examined pollen from individual trees and
analyzed the tryptic digests by Q-TOF LC-MSE, which
reveals total masses of peptides and the underlying amino
acid sequences, based on available sequence information.
The ability to determine the peptide sequences yields
more accurate information on expression of individual
isoforms. We demonstrated that at least 4 to 6 isoforms
were expressed in the pollen of one single tree of the birch
species B. pendula, B. nigra, B. chichibuensis, B. lenta and B.
costata. The actual number is likely to be higher since we
could not discriminate each individual isoform due to the
high similarity between some isoforms.
Q-TOF LC-MSE has the advantageous ability to simultaneously separate, identify and quantify peptide fragments. A
similar strategy has recently been followed by Chassaigne
et al. [47]. They identified five peanut-specific peptide
ions that were used as specific tags for the peanut allergenic proteins Ara h 1, Ara h 2, and Ara h 3. The relative
intensity of the specific peptides even provided information on the processing history of the peanut material.
Napoli et al. [48] also used mass spectrometry to analyze
an Ole e 1 mixture of multiple isoforms and their posttranslational modifications, which could not be separate
completely by 2-Dimension gel electrophoresis. A disadvantage of using Q-TOF LC-MSE instead of Q-TOF LCMSMS in combination with 2D gel electrophoresis and
Western blotting – in which allergic sera and specific antiIgE antibodies are employed – is that our method does
not distinguish IgE-binding isoforms from non-IgE-binding isoforms. Therefore, not all described PR-10 isoforms
are necessarily true isoallergens.
We included no purification step in the extraction procedure apart from protein separation on SDS-PAGE. This
minimizes the chance that certain isoforms are lost during
purification, but the Bet v 1 protein band might be contaminated with other pollen proteins with a similar mass.
Three peptides of the pollen allergen Bet v 7 were detected
in the 16–18 kDa band, but the amount of Bet v 7 was
estimated to be less than 2% of the amount of Bet v 1,
based on the peak intensities of these peptides. All peptides with high peak intensities could be attributed to Bet
v 1 isoforms. Full sequence coverage of Bet v 1 isoforms
cannot be achieved by using only trypsin as a protease, as
smaller peptides will be lost during peptide extraction

from the SDS-PAGE gel. Proteases that cleave at other sites
will yield peptides that cover part of the missing protein
sequence. Coverage with Q-TOF LC-MSE was 71–79% for
the B. pendula isoforms, which is higher than the 57–60%
coverage reported for Q-TOF MS/MS [38].
Swoboda et al. [34] estimated that, based on PDMS peak
areas of peptides, the relative amount of Bet v 1a (= PR10.01A01) in the pollen mixture from several B. pendula
trees was at least 50% of the total amount of Bet v 1. Ferreira et al. [37] estimated the relative amounts of different
Bet v 1 isoforms by NH2-terminal sequencing of purified
natural Bet v 1 and reported a ~2:2:1 ratio for isoforms
that respectively contain Ser, Thr and Ile at the 7th amino
acid position. This would correspond to expression of the
isoforms
02A01+02B01+02C01:
01A01+01A06:
01B01+01C04+01C05 in pollen of B. pendula 'Youngii'.
When we sum our results in this way, a ratio of
30%:45%:25% is obtained. The similarity between our
results and previously obtained estimates suggests that the
quantities obtained from B. pendula 'Youngii' are also representative for other B. pendula trees.
Allergenicity
Ferreira et al. [37] distinguished Bet v 1 isoforms with a
low, intermediate and high IgE-reactivity. Expression of
the isoforms 01B01 (= Bet v 1d, low IgE-reactivity), 02C01
(= Bet v 1c, intermediate IgE-reactivity), 01C04 (= Bet v 1f,
intermediate IgE-reactivity) and 01A01 (= Bet v 1a, high
IgE-reactivity) in the pollen of B. pendula 'Youngii' was
confirmed by identification of unique peptides (Table 3).
Isoforms of all three levels of IgE-reactivity were abundant
and encompassed 35–38% (high), 22–24% (intermediate) and 18–19% (low) of the total amount of Bet v 1.
This leaves 17–22% of the total Bet v 1 for isoforms with
an unknown IgE-reactivity. We observed similar quantities in two other B. pendula cultivars as well (results not
shown). Since B. pendula is known to be highly allergenic,
the presence of isoforms with a high IgE-reactivity is
apparently of determining influence on its allergenicity.
Interestingly, people that are not yet sensitized to B. pendula pollen come into contact with several abundant isoforms. However, the ability of these isoforms to provoke
an IgE-mediated response varies in patients that have
become sensitized [49,50]. The factors that cause one isoform to develop into having a high IgE-reactivity and
another isoform into having a low IgE-reactivity are currently unknown. The abundance of the isoforms may play
a role, but as isoforms with intermediate or low IgE-reactivity are also present in considerable quantities, this is
unlikely to be the only factor. Recently, Gao et al. [18],
investigated the association of allelic diversity of Mal d 1
and allergenicity in ten pedigree-linked apple cultivars,
and found that qualitative as well as quantitative factors
were involved.

The opportunities for identifying birch trees that only
express hypoallergenic isoforms are limited. The isoforms
Bet v 1l and Bet v1d (= 01B01) are currently known as
hypoallergenic [37]. The crystal-structure of Bet v 1l has
been determined [51] and its allergenicity has recently
been tested on a large group of patients [50]. However,
none of the examined species contained Bet v 1l, despite
thorough examination, and Bet v 1l may represent a
sequencing artifact or an unexpressed allele. Only B. pendula, B. populifolia and B. plathyphylla contained 01B01.
The most similar isoforms in the other species differed by
at least five amino acids. In contrast, the highly allergenic
isoform 01A01 is expressed in pollen of B. pendula
'Youngii', while the B. populifolia genome also contains the
01A01 sequence. The other Betula species do not harbor
Bet v 1a, but B. chichibuensis, B. costata and B. nigra contain
isoforms that differ only by 1–3 amino acids from Bet v
1a. A high similarity between isoforms increases the
chance that they share epitopes, although a few amino
acid substitutions may influence the allergenicity drastically [52-54]. In all species, these isoforms are abundant.
B. lenta forms an exception as the isoform most similar to
Bet v 1a has a sequence similarity of 95.5% and encodes a
protein that differs by seven amino acids.

Conclusion
We identified 12 to 25 unique PR-10 sequences in each of
eight different birch species. Application of Q-TOF LCMSE revealed that genes from two large subfamilies (01
and 02) were expressed in birch pollen. We showed that
Q-TOF LC-MSE allowed fast screening of Bet v 1 isoforms
in birch pollen by determining presence and relative
abundances of individual isoforms. The pollen of four
birch species contained a mixture of Bet v 1 isoforms, with
abundant levels of isoforms that were similar to isoforms
with a high IgE-reactivity. We predict that the allergenic
potency of these species will be high. B. lenta (subgenus
Betulenta) lacked isoforms with a high similarity to isoforms with a high IgE-reactivity. This species and related
species represent the most promising candidates for further screening of hypoallergenicity by for example skin
prick tests or nasal challenges.

Methods
Plant Material
We collected young leaves from eight Betula species (Table
1). A recent phylogenetic analysis identified four groups
(subgenera) of species within the genus Betula [13]. Each
subgenus is represented by at least one species. Four species from the subgenus Betula were included here to cover
the variation within this large group. Plant material was
collected from the botanical collections of PPO Boskoop
(Boskoop, the Netherlands), the Botanical Garden of
Wageningen (Wageningen, the Netherlands) and the Von
Gimborn Arboretum (Doorn, the Netherlands). Fresh leaf

samples were analyzed by flow cytometry (Plant Cytometry Services, Schijndel, The Netherlands) to estimate the
ploidy level. Diploid (B. pendula) and tetraploid (B. pubescens) controls were included. All examined accessions
were diploid, thus keeping the number of expected
sequences per accession small. During the flowering
period of birch in April-May 2004, we collected pollen
from the same trees for the species B. nigra, B. chichibuensis, B. lenta, B. costata and B. pendula.
PCR, cloning and sequencing
DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PR-10
alleles were amplified from genomic DNA with two
primer pairs that had been tested and used in previous
research on B. pendula [32]. PCR amplification with both
primer pairs was performed in 20 μl reactions containing
0.1 mM dNTP, PCR Reaction buffer (Eurogentec), 1.5 mM
MgCl2, 0.6 μM forward primer, 0.6 μM reverse primer, 0.5
U Taq polymerase (Goldstar), and 20–80 ng template
DNA. PCR reactions started with a heating step at 95°C
for 15 minutes, followed by 16–24 cycles of denaturation
at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 50°C for 45 s, and extension
at 72°C for 2 min. A final extension step of 10 min at
72°C was added after the last cycle. To reduce the number
of PCR recombination artifacts, we used as few PCR cycles
as possible. The minimum number of cycles required to
generate sufficient product for cloning was assessed by visual inspection of the amplified products on agarose gel.

PCR products were purified with the MinElute PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen). Purified samples were ligated into
the pGEM-T easy Vector (Promega) and established in
Escherichia coli Subcloning Efficiency DH5α cells (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. White
colonies were picked from agar plates and grown overnight at 37°C in freeze medium. We performed PCRbased screening with vector-specific M13 primers. These
PCR products were purified with Sephadex G-50 (Millipore). The DYEnamic™ ET Terminator Cycle Sequencing
Kit (Amersham) was used for the sequence reactions. We
analyzed sequence products on a 96-capillary system (ABI
3730 × l). The genomic Betula sequences have been submitted to GenBank as EU526132–EU526277.
Phenetic/phylogenetic analysis
Potential PCR artifacts (strand switching and base misincorporation) were excluded by retaining only those
sequences that were confirmed in independent PCRs. We
included one reference sequence per B. pendula gene in the
dataset for comparison with previous results [32]. Nucleotide sequences were aligned using CLUSTAL W with a
gap penalty of 10 and a gap extension penalty of 2. We
excluded primer traces and introns from further analysis.
A Neighbor Joining (NJ) tree was constructed with Kimura

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/24

two-parameter distances. Gaps were treated as missing
characters. Bootstrapping was carried out with 1,000 replicates in PAUP 4.0b10 [55]. The outgroup was composed
of PR-10 sequences from Castanea sativa (AJ417550) and
Fagus sylvatica (AJ130889), which are two related Fagales
species. Parsimony analysis was conducted in PAUP as a
heuristic search, while using the following options:
100,000 random additions while holding one tree at each
step, TBR branch swapping, the MulTrees option switched
on, and ACCTRAN for character optimization. A strict
consensus tree was calculated for all of the most parsimonious trees. Branch support was assessed by bootstrap
analysis comprising 10,000 replicates consisting of 10
random addition sequences with TBR branch swapping.
Both analyses produced highly similar results; therefore,
only the NJ analysis is shown.
Protein search database
Nucleotide sequences were aligned codon-by-codon. We
analyzed general selection patterns at the molecular level
using DnaSp 4.00 [56]. The number of non-synonymous
(Ka) and synonymous substitutions (Ks) per site were calculated from pair wise comparisons with incorporation of
the Jukes-Cantor correction. Nucleotide data were translated. A Fasta database with the resulting protein
sequences was used as a search database in the Q-TOF LCMSE analysis. As sequence information for the primer
region was unavailable, we used the GenBank sequences
X15877 (subfamily 01), X77265 (02), X77600 (03), and
X77601 (05) to fill these gaps in sequences from the
respective subfamilies. The initiating Methionine is
removed during PR-10 protein synthesis [30,37] and was
therefore removed from the predicted proteins. Protein
sequences of birch PR-10 isoforms in GenBank (overview
in: Schenk et al., 2006), keratin, trypsin and Bet v 7
(AJ311666) were added to the database.
Protein extraction
Fifty mg of pollen were suspended in 1 ml of 0.05 M TrisHCl (pH 7.5) following Cadot et al. [57], who found that
yield and diversity of the extracted allergens are optimal at
pH 7.5 for birch pollen. After incubation under constant
shaking at room temperature for 1 hr, the pollen extract
was centrifuged at 10.000 rpm for 5 min. The pellet was
ground with an Eppendorf-fitting pestle. The extract was
then shaken for another hour. The supernatant was collected after centrifugation (10.000 rpm; 5 min) and freeze
dried for storage.
SDS-PAGE
The freeze-dried protein extract was redissolved in 0.05 M
Tris-HCL (pH 7.5) and analyzed with SDS-PAGE to localize Bet v 1-type proteins. Proteins were separated on a
15% w/v acrylamide SDS-PAGE gel with a 5% w/v stacking gel using the Mini-Protean II gel system (Bio-Rad).

After staining with Coomassie BB R-250, the gels were
scanned and analyzed by Quantity One (Bio-Rad) scanner
software. Relative molecular masses were determined
with SDS-PAGE Standards broad range markers (BioRad).
The protein bands at a relative molecular mass of 16–18
kDa were cut out of the SDS-PAGE gel and processed
essentially according to Shevchenko [58]. Bands were
sliced into 1 mm3-pieces. Bands at 14, 19 and 35 kDa were
cut out and analyzed as well. Proteins were reduced with
DTT and alkylated with iodoacetamide. Gel pieces were
dried under vacuum, and swollen in 0.1 M NaHCO3 that
contained sequence-grade porcine trypsin (10 ng/μl,
Promega). After digestion at 37°C overnight, peptides
were extracted from the gel with 50% v/v acetonitrile, 5%
v/v formic acid and dried under vacuum.
Q-TOF LC-MS/MS and Q-TOF LC-MSE
Tryptic digests were analyzed by one-dimensional LC-MS
in high-throughput configuration using the Ettan™ MDLC
system (GE Healthcare), which was directly connected to
a Q-TOF-2 Mass Spectrometer (Waters Corporation, UK).
Samples (5 μl) were loaded on 5 mm × 300 μm ID Zorbax™ 300 SB C18 trap columns (Agilent Technologies),
and peptides were separated on 100 μm i.d. × 15 cm Chromolith CapRod monolithic C18 capillary columns
(Merck) at a flow rate of approximately 1 μl/min. A gradient was applied using two solvents. Solvent A contained
an aqueous 0.1% formic acid solution and solvent B contained 84% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid. The gradient
consisted of isocratic conditions at 5% B for 10 min, a linear gradient to 30% B over 40 min, a linear gradient to
100% B over 10 min, and then a linear gradient back to
5% B over 5 min. MS analyses were performed in positive
mode using ESI with a NanoLockSpray source. As lock
mass, [Glu1]fibrinopeptide B (1 pmol/μl) (Sigma) was
delivered from the syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus,
USA) to the reference sprayer of the NanoLockSpray
source at a flow rate of 1 μl/min. The lock mass channel
was sampled every 10 s.

To identify the 14, 16–18, 19 and 35 kDa bands, the QTOF-2 was operating in MS/MS mode for data dependent
acquisition. The mass spectrometer was programmed to
determine charge states of the eluting peptides, and to
switch from MS to MS/MS mode for z ≥ 2 at the appropriate collision energy for Argon gas-mediated CID. Each
resulting MS/MS spectrum contained sequence information on a single peptide. Processing and database searching of the MS/MS data set was performed using
ProteinLynx Global SERVER (PLGS) v2.3 (Waters Corporation) and the NCBI non-redundant protein database,
while taking fixed (carbamidomethylation) and variable
(oxidation of Methionine) modifications into account.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/24

After the identification of multiple Bet v 1 isoforms in the
16–18 kDa band, we analyzed the tryptic digest of this
band with Q-TOF LC-MSE. The Q-TOF-2 was programmed to alternate between low and elevated levels of
collision energy. Collision energy was 5 eV in MS mode
and was increased in two steps from 28 to 40 eV in MSE
mode. Measuring time in both modes was 0.9 s with an
interscan delay of 0.1 s. Unfragmented precursors predominate in low energy mode, while fragmented ions of
the precursors are observed in high energy mode. Digests
were analyzed in duplicate. MSE data were analyzed
according to the procedure described by Silva et al. [39]
with the Expression module in PLGS. Different peptide
components were detected with an ion detection algorithm, and then clustered by mass and retention time, followed by normalization of the data. The described PR-10
protein search database was used to identify peptides,
while taking fixed (carbamidomethylation) and variable
(oxidation of Methionine) modifications into account.
After processing by PLGS, the so-called Exact Mass and
Retention Time (EMRT) table was exported and reclustered using the PACP tool [59] to correct potential misalignments and split peak detection errors. Retention time
was normalized and the reclustered EMRT table was further analyzed in Excel.
