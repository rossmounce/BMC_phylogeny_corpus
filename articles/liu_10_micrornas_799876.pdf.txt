Abstract
Background: MicroRNA (miRNA) and other small regulatory RNAs contribute to the modulation of a large number
of cellular processes. We sequenced three small RNA libraries prepared from the whole body, and the anteriormiddle and posterior silk glands of Bombyx mori, with a view to expanding the repertoire of silkworm miRNAs and
exploring transcriptional differences in miRNAs between segments of the silk gland.
Results: With the aid of large-scale Solexa sequencing technology, we validated 257 unique miRNA genes,
including 202 novel and 55 previously reported genes, corresponding to 324 loci in the silkworm genome. Over 30
known silkworm miRNAs were further corrected in their sequence constitutes and length. A number of reads
originated from the loop regions of the precursors of two previously reported miRNAs (bmo-miR-1920 and miR1921). Interestingly, the majority of the newly identified miRNAs were silkworm-specific, 23 unique miRNAs were
widely conserved from invertebrates to vertebrates, 13 unique miRNAs were limited to invertebrates, and 32 were
confined to insects. We identified 24 closely positioned clusters and 45 paralogs of miRNAs in the silkworm
genome. However, sequence tags showed that paralogs or clusters were not prerequisites for coordinated
transcription and accumulation. The majority of silkworm-specific miRNAs were located in transposable elements,
and displayed significant differences in abundance between the anterior-middle and posterior silk gland.
Conclusions: Conservative analysis revealed that miRNAs can serve as phylogenetic markers and function in
evolutionary signaling. The newly identified miRNAs greatly enrich the repertoire of insect miRNAs, and provide
insights into miRNA evolution, biogenesis, and expression in insects. The differential expression of miRNAs in the
anterior-middle and posterior silk glands supports their involvement as new levels in the regulation of the silkworm
silk gland.

Background
Following their initial discovery in worms, an increasing
number of 18-30 nt-sized small RNAs have been identified as crucial regulatory molecules in multicellular
organisms, animal viruses, and unicellular organisms
[1-7]. Identification of abundant miRNAs and other
small regulatory RNAs in different organisms is critical
in improving our understanding of genome organization,
genome biology, and evolution [8]. The silkworm,
Bombx mori (B. mori), an important model organism
used to investigate several fundamental biological phenomena (including development, gene regulation, and
morphological innovation [9]), has been employed for

silk production for about 5,000 years. The recently
sequenced B. mori is the first lepidopteran insect genome that provides a resource for comparative genomics
studies, facilitating our understanding of insect evolution
[10]. The latest miRNA database release (miRBase 14.0)
presents 91 silkworm miRNAs and two so-called
miRNA* sequences originating from the RNA hairpin
arm opposite the annotated mature miRNA-containing
arm [2,11]. However, some of these miRNAs have been
identified solely on the basis of sequence similarity to
known orthologs, and have never been confirmed
experimentally. Furthermore, the total number of silkworm miRNA genes is significantly lower than that in
fruit fly (152) and human (701), and it is likely that
further miRNAs remain to be discovered in the
silkworm.

To extend the known repertoire of small regulatory
RNAs expressed in the silkworm, we constructed and
sequenced three small RNA libraries prepared from the
whole body (WB) as well as the anterior-middle and
posterior silk glands (AMSG and PSG) of day-3 fifth
instar larvae. The silk gland of B. mori is differentiated
into anterior, middle, and posterior sections [12,13].
Expression of all sericin genes is limited to the anterior
and middle parts of the middle silk gland [14,15],
whereas the fibroin genes are expressed exclusively in
the posterior silk gland [16,17]. Both sericin and fibroin
genes are topologically and temporally regulated at the
transcriptional level in a concerted manner during larval
development [18,19]. The spatial distribution of miRNAs
may contribute to the mechanistic understanding of
concerted silk protein synthesis. Each library was individually sequenced, and generated more than 5 million
short reads, resulting in a total of 36 million reads, of
which 1,819,103 were miRNA reads. The newly identified miRNAs significantly enhance our knowledge of
insect miRNA species and provide insights into miRNA
evolution, biogenesis, and expression in insects.

Results
Overall complexity of small RNA pools between the
libraries

We obtained raw data by sequencing three small RNA
pools of the whole silkworm body from 5th-instar day-3
larvae, and anterior-middle and posterior silkworm silk
glands, using the latest sequencing Solexa technology
[8,20], filtered the low quality reads according to base
quality value, trimmed the adaptor sequence at the 3’
primer terminus, cleaned up 5’ adaptor contaminants
formed by ligation, and finally collected the small RNAs
and analyzed size distribution. The raw data and processed files of the three libraries have been deposited in
NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) [21,22] under
accession number GSE 17965. For analysis, all identical
sequence reads in each small RNA library were grouped
and converted into unique sequences with associated
counts of the individual reads. The flow results of data
filtration for the three libraries are presented in Additional file 1. The total number of raw sequence reads in
the whole body small RNA library is 5,467,768, comprising 2,848,263 low-quality reads (52.09%) and 2,619,505
high-quality reads (47.91%). The majority of high-quality
reads in this library (95.65%) were longer than 18 nt,
and used to map the silkworm genome assembly (build
2) using the SOAP program [23], leading to 1,844,635
genome-matched reads (73.78%). All clean reads of at
least 18 nt were divided into different categories of
small RNAs. The length distribution of high-quality
reads was different among the three RNA libraries
(Additional file 2). For example, some 778,343 (30.06%)

sequences in the whole body are canonical 22 nt miRNAs, while 1,677,919 and 1,142,967 reads meet this
length in the two silk gland libraries, accounting for
12.35% and 8.27% of the respective high-quality reads. A
significant fraction of the clean reads was derived from
putative degradation products of rRNAs, tRNAs, small
nuclear RNAs, and other non-coding RNAs (27.38%).
Another two large fractions were derived from unannotated genome sites (20.13%) and highly repeated
sequences in the genome (20.57%). Substantial portions
(2.58% and 2.18%) matched the exons and intergenic
regions of protein-coding genes, respectively. In all,
680,406 reads (27.16% high-quality clean reads) were
finally screened as miRNA candidates in the whole body
small RNA library, and submitted for subsequent analyses. Similarly, the total sequence reads of potential
miRNAs in the two silk gland libraries were 920,194
and 315,535, accounting for 7.78% and 2.04% of highquality clean reads, respectively. Investigation of unique
reads in the whole body and anterior-middle and posterior silk gland libraries revealed that the largest fractions
were attributable to unannotated small RNAs (49.89%,
52.70% and 56.69% of high-quality clean reads, respectively). Upon addition of the known and unannotated
miRNA loci, the unique sequence reads of candidate
miRNAs in the three libraries were estimated as ‘923’,
‘2,355’ and ‘1,586’, accounting for only 2.43%, 1.81%,
and 1.98% of the respective high-quality clean unique
reads. After successive filtering of these data sets, we
identified 257 unique miRNA genes comprising 55
known and 202 novel genes, which collectively correspond to 324 independent genomic loci (Additional file
3). Notably, however, the majority of total or unique
reads in this category in the three libraries were derived
from annotated miRNA hairpins. The sequence reads
and hairpin structures of all sequenced miRNAs in the
whole body, anterior-middle silk gland, and posterior
silk gland are detailed in Additional files, 4, 5, and 6,
respectively. Reads counts and genomic distribution
categories of the conserved and silkworm-specific miRNAs were summarized in Figure 1.
The majority of known silkworm miRNAs are conserved
across species

To date, only 94 miRNAs of Bombyx mori have been
reported (Additional file 7) [24-30], and are available
from latest miRBase database (Release 14.0) [31]. Some
of these miRNAs were identified based solely on
sequence similarity to known orthologous miRNAs, and
have never been confirmed experimentally (Additional
file 7) [24,26,32]. Here, we present evidence to support
the authenticity of 55 known miRNAs. The remaining
39 known miRNAs, including bmo-mir-124 and bmomir-1926, were not successfully sequenced, possibly

because of low expression levels or stage-/tissue-specific
transcription. In total, 10 conserved miRNAs were firstly
identified in the silkworm, 54 conserved miRNAs were
sequenced in all three RNA libraries, while 12 were
detected in only one or two small RNA libraries (Figure
1A; Additional file 7). For example, bmo-miR-133, miR137, and miR-932 were identified in the whole body, but
not in the anterior-middle and posterior silk gland,
opposite to the patterns shown by bmomiR-285, miR929, and miR-9b. Sequence comparisons between silkworm miRNA candidates and other miRNAs present in
miRBase (miRBase 14.0) revealed that 23 silkworm miRNAs (including the new homolog of dme-miR-33) are
widely distributed in over 20 species from invertebrates
to vertebrates, 13 (including the novel homolog of lgimiR-1175) are evolutionarily conserved throughout
invertebrates, 32 (including 7 new sequences) exist only
in the Insecta, and 37 known miRNAs (bmo-mir-1920,
mir-1921, mir-1923, mir-1926 and 34 latest members)
are presently confined to B. mori (Additional file 7). All
conserved silkworm miRNAs were classified into known

families or currently undefined groups on the basis of
sequence similarity (Additional file 8). Various families
of these miRNAs may have evolved for purposes as
diverse as the phyla in which they occur. The identification of conserved miRNAs as potential phylogenetic
markers raises the possibility that miRNAs serve as
rapid evolutionary signaling molecules.
We observed heterogeneity at the 5’ and 3’ ends of
sequenced tags derived from the same arms of the known
miRNAs; strikingly, the 3’ ends showed stronger heterogeneity than the 5’ ends. As exemplified by bmo-miR-263a,
let-7a, and miR-317 in Figure 2, the highlighted isoform of
mature sequences is more highly accumulated in the three
libraries than is the previously annotated sequence, and
should be regarded as the final functional molecule. Similarly, over 30 known silkworm miRNAs were refined
based on sequencing reads (Additional file 9). The miRBase annotations of silkworm miRNAs may thus be
improved based on the most frequently sequenced
miRNA isoforms. Nevertheless, some annotated miRNAs
and highest reads were not derived from the same arms of

bmo-mir-263a, bmo-let-7a and bmo-mir-317 sequences and their read counts are shown. Underlined sequences are annotated in miRBase 14.0.
The boxed sequences have the highest read counts. The annotated mature sequence of bmo-mir-317 was not identified, while the maximal
sequence in the whole body was strongly accumulated in the two other libraries, and consequently regarded as the most active isoform.

the hairpin precursors, as illustrated by bmo-mir-10, bmomir-276, and bmo-mir-281 (Figure 3, Additional file 9).
Accordingly, we postulate that these miRNA precursors
produce functional molecules on both arms in one or
more cell types in the silk gland or other tissues of the
silkworm. Following identification by cloning [26], bmomir-1920 and mir-1921 exhibit sequential degradation
from the 5’ to 3’ ends, and low levels of the annotated
mature sequences accumulate in the three libraries

(Additional file 10). Actually, a small number of reads originating from the loop regions exist in our sequencing
data, but they should be by-products of processing. Wellestablished known miRNAs tend to show high numbers of
reads for the miR and miR* sequences, and very small
numbers or no reads elsewhere. Now, we find bmo-mir1920 and mir-1921 suspicious with respect to being real
miRNAs when we see significant numbers of overlapping
reads tiling a whole region.

Figure 3 Annotated miRNA and maximal sequences from different arms of the precursors. The sequencing reads of four miRNAs in the
whole body are depicted. Underlined sequences are the annotated mature sequences while the boxed sequences represent the maximum.

In all, 26 conserved miRNAs are closely clustered as
polycistronic transcripts (<2.5 kb) (Additional file 11).
Clusters 1-8 constitute conserved miRNAs, whereas
clusters 9-12 comprise conserved and silkworm-specific
miRNAs. All clustered miRNAs have different total read
counts in any one of the three libraries. For example,
the read counts of bmo-miR-275 are almost 10-fold
greater than those of bmo-miR-305 in the anterior-middle and posterior silk gland, but only two-fold greater
relative to the whole body. The majority of clustered
miRNAs are derived from unique regions of the genome

and, in general, are coordinately regulated. In cluster 6,
bmo-miR-216 is intergenic, whereas other members of
the cluster are intronic. The read count of bmo-mir-216
is far lower than those of intronic miRNAs in this cluster, and the miRNAs are thus unlikely to be coordinately regulated. Seven families of conserved miRNAs,
including four clusters described above (2, 4, 7, and 8),
have paralogs in the silkworm genome (mir-2, mir-993,
mir-9, mir-92, mir-263, mir-279, and mir-989) (Figure
4). Significant differences were seen between the read
counts of clustered paralog miRNAs across the three

libraries (Additional file 12). In paralog 1, both arms of
bmo-mir-10 produced over a 10-fold greater number of
mature molecules than did bmo-mir-993a and mir-993b.
Both mir-10 and mir-993b were confirmed in the three
libraries, but mir-993a was absent in the posterior silk
gland. The five members in paralog 2 or cluster 10 produced miRNAs from the 3’ arms and star sequences
from the 5’ arms. However, neither miRNAs nor miRNAs* were equally accumulated in each library, and the
star sequences of bmo-mir-2a-1 abnormally outnumbered miRNA sequences in the whole body. The read
counts of bmo-miR-263a were at least 1000-fold higher
than those of bmo-miR-263b in each library. The data
collectively indicate that both paralogs and clusters are
not prerequisites for the coordinate transcription and
accumulation of miRNA genes.
The miRNA depot of Bombyx mori is greatly enriched by
newly identified miRNAs

In total, 209 unique miRNA and 87 star sequences were
identified in this study (see Additional file 3). Sequence
comparisons between the silkworm candidates and miRNAs of other organisms present in miRBase (miRBase
14.0) revealed that 11 novel silkworm miRNAs were

orthologous to those identified in other species (Additional file 7) whereas most unique miRNAs displayed no
evidence of evolutionary conservation, even within the
Insecta, and thus appeared to be silkworm-specific
(Additional file 3). The genome loci of all silkworm
miRNA genes were characterized, as presented in Additional file 3 and Figure 1B. We identified 12 miRNA
genes in the exons of protein-coding genes, including
four conserved and eight silkworm-specific miRNAs.
Four novel members, bmo-mir-2783, bmo-mir-2811,
bmo-mir-2825, and bmo-mir-2829, were located within
the introns and exons of single protein-coding genes. In
total, 52 miRNAs, including 13 conserved and 39 silkworm-specific members were intronic, whereas 95
miRNA genes were widely distributed within intergenic
regions (IG regions) of the silkworm genome. In
contrast to conserved and known miRNAs, 190 silkworm-specific miRNA genes were located in predicted
transposable elements, and were repeat-associated
(Figure 1C, Additional file 3). Strikingly, these transposable elements are preferentially found outside proteincoding genes; only 30 of 181 unique transposable
elements seem to be contained within predicted proteincoding genes. We identified 24 clusters consisting of

Liu et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:148
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/148

63 novel miRNA and 14 annotated genes. Clusters 3
and 4 were located in the second exon of the proteincoding genes, BGIBMGA010447 and BGIBMGA008683,
respectively. Clusters 2, 7, 9, 16, 17, 18 were composed
of intronic miRNA genes. Both clusters 6 and 12 consisted of intronic as well as intergenic miRNAs (Additional file 11), and are thus unlikely to be transcribed as
polycistronic primary transcripts. Clusters 10, 11, 13-15
and 24 were located in intergenic regions, whereas five
clusters (19 to 23) were derived from predicted transposable elements. We identified 45 groups of paralogs,
38 consisting of 110 silkworm-specific miRNA genes
and 7 comprising 21 conserved miRNAs (Additional file
12). Paralogous miRNAs existed in 14 clusters, specifically,
2, 4, 7, 8, 13-15,, 18-24 (Additional file 11). These clusters
possibly originated via a series of duplication and deletion
events during silkworm evolution. The clustered paralogous miRNAs may have overlapping functions in regulating a similar set of genes, as reported for the three
clusters, miR-106b~25, miR-106a~363, and miR-17~92 in
mice [33].
A number of evolutionarily conserved miRNAs (let7a, mir-1, and bantam) were among the most abundant
miRNAs, as demonstrated previously [8,34-37], whereas
the majority of novel miRNAs (particularly the silkworm-specific components) were among the least
abundant (Additional file 13, Figures 1C,1D), consistent
with the correlation between evolutionary conservation
of miRNAs and their expression levels [35,38,39]. However, some conserved miRNAs displayed very low read
counts; these included bmo-mir-282, bmo-mir-307,
and bmo-mir-252. Some silkworm-specific miRNAs
(bmo-mir-2755, bmo-mir-2756, bmo-mir-2758, and
bmo-mir-2766) exhibited very high sequence reads,
comparable to those of the abundant conserved miRNAs (Additional file 13). Nevertheless, momentary and
local read counts cannot represent transcriptional levels
during the entire life-cycle of the silkworm. For example, we could not identify bmo-mir-124 in the present
study, but this miRNA was confirmed to be strongly
expressed in the embryo and early larval stages of the
silkworm [28]. Only 26 silkworm-specific miRNAs were
common to the three libraries. In addition, 7 were
shared by the whole body and the anterior-middle
silk gland, 3 by the whole body and the posterior silk
gland, 24 by the anterior-middle and posterior silk
gland, 19 were in the whole body only, 94 were in
the anterior-middle silk gland only, and 21 were identified only in the posterior silk gland (Additional
file 13, Figure 1A). These data support the theory of
several levels of complexity in miRNA processing
and regulation in response to specific physiological
circumstances.

Discussion
The present results provide experimental evidence supporting the authenticity of 257 unique miRNA genes in
the silkworm, including 202 novel and 55 known ones
(Additional file 3). Analysis of the evolutionary conservation of all silkworm miRNAs revealed that only 23
were widely conserved from invertebrates to vertebrates,
13 were limited to invertebrates, and 32 had homologs
in other insects (Additional file 7), whereas the majority
of miRNAs were specific to the silkworm. Nearly 430 of
the 447 newly identified chicken miRNAs were also
likely to be exclusively expressed in chicken lineages [8].
These data indicate that most of the newly identified
miRNAs are present in only a small group of organisms,
and in some cases, in a single species [8,35-37]. Speciesspecific miRNAs may be large in number and evolutionarily dynamic as a result of gene duplication, sequence
divergence and gene loss. A gray pawn hypothesis has
been proposed for the species-specific chemoreceptor
gene families in Caenorhabditis species [40]; this
hypothesis suggests that individual genes are of little significance, but the aggregate activities of a large number
of diverse genomic loci are required to establish a large
phenotype space. The evolutionarily divergent miRNAs
may also contribute to establishing and maintaining
phenotypic diversity between different groups of organisms [41,42], and highly specific miRNAs have a specialized function in particular organisms, possibly involving
regulation of lineage-specific pathways [8]. Furthermore,
over 60% of the matched sequence tag fraction was
attributed to unannotated small RNAs. The substantial
proportion of unclassified small RNAs identified in this
study may represent other classes of small regulatory
RNAs in the silkworm that have not been covered in
our analyses. Some of these may include rare miRNAs
represented by very low sequence reads, thus not passing our filtering criteria. These candidates should be
explored in future studies applying the deep sequencing
approach to developmental stages, tissues, or cells.
Our sequence tag analysis led to the identification of
miRNA and miRNA* sequences for 42 previously annotated miRNA genes and unilateral sequence tags for 11
known miRNA genes (Additional file 9). The total reads
of 9 miRstar sequences (miR-10*, miR-276*, miR-281*,
miR-282*, miR-2a-1*, miR-965*, miR-993a*, miR-993b*,
and miR-9b*) were heavily skewed toward the RNA
hairpin arm containing annotated miRNAs in at least
one library (Additional file 9, names in green). Furthermore, we observed that bmo-miR-iab-4-5p levels
exceeded those of bmo-miR-iab-4-3p in all three
libraries (Additional file 9), thus revealing strand bias,
even for the twin miRNAs. The reversal in the ratios of
5’- and 3’-derived sequence tags indicates preferential

Liu et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:148
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/148

use of mature miRNAs originating from different arms
of pre-miRNA precursors, and suggests additional levels
of complexity in miRNA processing, which remain
incompletely understood [8]. These findings are evidently inconsistent with the current knowledge of
miRNA biogenesis and strand selection. The miRNA*
strand is probably degraded rapidly on exclusion from
the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), as the
recovery rate of miRNAs* from endogenous tissues is
100-fold lower than that of miRNAs [43,44]. Consequently, in many cases, miRNA* cannot be detected
using conventional methods, because of rapid turnover
[8]. However, in the silkworm, a number of miRNA
genes (mir-2a-1, mir-2b, mir-10, and mir-282) exhibited a similar number of sequence reads originating
from the 5’ and 3’ arms of the miRNA hairpin precursors (5p and 3p, respectively) (Additional file 9*). The
equivalent expression rates of miRNA and miRNA* largely result from similar 5’ end stability that leads to
equal incorporation of either strand into the RISC and
protection from degradation [45]. In some cases,
sequence tags originate from the terminal loop region
of the pre-miRNA precursor (Additional file 10). Such
examples have also been reported in other studies [46],
and are explained as genuine products of pre-miRNA
processing or random degradation products of unprocessed pre-miRNA [8].
We identified 5 pairs of sense/antisense miRNAs in
the silkworm (Additional file 3). For example, bmo-mir927, -mir-79, and bmo-mir-2799-as are the reverse
complements of the bmo-mir-1926, -mir-9b, and bmomir-2799 hairpins, respectively, and form hairpins reminiscent of miRNA precursors (Figure 5A). Sequencing
tags from small RNA libraries of the anterior-middle
and posterior silk glands mapped uniquely to the 5’
arms of the bmo-mir-2799 and bmo-mir-2799-as hairpins. Interestingly, the sense and antisense transcripts
display highly similar sequences, and are paralogous
miRNAs (Figure 5B, Additional file 12). Their mature
sequences are derived from complementary palindromes
of the precursors. Both miRNA and miRNA* sequences
were identified for bmo-mir-927 in the three libraries,
but no sequencing reads mapped to the bmo-mir-1926
hairpin, although this has previously been identified in
the silkworm moth [26], possibly indicating stage specificity. Sense and antisense miRNAs may coordinately
control genes at their respective locations, as they both
have target sites in the 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs)
and 5’ UTRs of relevant genes (Figure 5C). The host
gene BGIBMGA006265-TA is significantly enriched in
all examined tissues of fifth-instar day-3 larval silkworm
[47], and is optimally aligned to the thioredoxin domain

Page 8 of 13

of annotated Homo sapiens disulfide isomerase [48]
that functions in protecting hypoxic cells from apoptosis [49]. Another sense/antisense miRNA pair,
miR-79/miR-9b, also contains potential targeting sites
for the untranslated regions of their home gene,
BGIBMGA005856-TA, similar to the checkpoint kinase
of Mus musculus. However, previous studies suggest
that miRNAs do not target highly coexpressed genes
[50,51], and thus it needs to be urgently determined
whether the potential sites are indeed authentic and
how expression of the sense/antisense pairs and their
host genes are coordinated in biogenesis. The bmo-miR927/miR-1926 pair is located in one intergenic region of
the silkworm genome, but has target sites in the 3’
UTRs of unannotated genes proximal to their loci. Significantly, the sense and antisense miRNAs target each
other (Figure 5D). These miRNAs may potently downregulate each other via transcriptional interference, or may
interact post-transcriptionally, or function in vivo via a
feedback pathway. However, the issue of whether the
sense and antisense transcripts are processed in the
same cell type remains to be established, since sense
and antisense miRNAs within an individual cell should
interact. Genomic arrangement of two miRNAs arising
from different strands of the same locus provides a
simple and efficient means to create nonoverlapping
miRNA expression domains [52-54]. The whole body
and the anterior-middle and posterior silk glands comprise more than two cell types; a particular pre-miRNA
may be processed into normal mature miRNA in one
type of cell and miRNA* in another. While miRNA and
miRNA* are equally processed, their functions may be
distinct in the different cell types constituting this tissue. Therefore, the sequencing reads in unique cell
lines of the silkworm should aid in determining the significance of miRNA, miRNA,* and sense/antisense
transcripts.

Conclusions
We have sequenced miRNAs in the whole body and silk
gland of the silkworm. Our data confirm the authenticity of 257 miRNA genes in the silkworm, including 202
novel and 55 known miRNAs. Conservative analyses
imply that miRNAs act as phyla markers in evolutionary
signaling. The silkworm-specific miRNAs were significantly different between the anterior-middle and posterior silk glands. Target predictions revealed that the
sense/antisense miRNAs target the 3’ and 5’ UTRs of
their host genes. Identification of novel miRNAs
resulted in significant enrichment of the repertoire of
insect miRNAs and provided insights into miRNA evolution, biogenesis, and expression in insects.

Methods
Animal breeding and sample preparation

Domesticated silkworm (Bombyx mori) strain DaZao,
was reared at 25°C on a natural diet of clean mulberry leaves. Silk glands were manually dissected from
day-3 fifth larvae in 0.9% NaCl, rinsed with DEPCtreated water, and promptly immersed in liquid
nitrogen.
Small RNA library preparation and sequencing

Silk glands and whole bodies of day-3 fifth instar larvae were collected for RNA isolation. Following purification, total RNA samples were immediately preserved
in ethanol and stored at -80°C until further use. For
deep sequencing, the small RNA samples were
prepared as follows: total RNA of each sample was
size-fractionated on a 15% PAGE gel, and a 16-30 nt
fraction was collected. The 5’ RNA adapter (5’-GUUCAGAGUUCUACAGUCCGACGAUC-3’) was ligated
to the RNA pool with T4 RNA ligase. Ligated RNA
was size-fractionated on a 15% agarose gel, and a
40-60 nt fraction excised. The 3’RNA adapter (5’-pUCGUAUGCCGUCUUCUGCUUGidT-3’; p, phosphate;
idT, inverted deoxythymidine) was subsequently ligated
to precipitated RNA using T4 RNA ligase. Ligated
RNA was size-fractionated on a 10% agarose gel, and
the 70-90 nt fraction (small RNA + adaptors) excised.
Small RNAs ligated with adaptors were subjected to
RT-PCR (Superscript II reverse transcriptase, 15 cycles
of amplification) to produce sequencing libraries. PCR
products were purified and small RNA libraries were
sequenced using Solexa, a massively parallel sequencing technology.
Computational analysis of sequencing data

Small 35 nt RNA reads were produced using an Illumina 1G Genome Analyzer at BGI-Shenzhen. Low
quality reads were trimmed with our own perl script.
Adaptor sequences were accurately clipped with the
aid of a dynamic programming algorithm. After elimination of redundancy, sequences ≥ 18 nt were mapped
to the silkworm Build2 genome using SOAP v1.11
[23]. Sequences that perfectly matched the genome
along their entire length were considered for subsequent analyses. Genome sequences and annotations of
the silkworm Build2 genome were downloaded from
SilkDB [55]. Sequences matching silkworm rRNA,
tRNA, snRNA and snoRNA deposited at the NCBI
GenBank database or overlapping with rRNA and
tRNA annotations of the Build2 genome were discarded. Repeat overlapping sequences were annotated

Page 10 of 13

as repeat-associated small RNAs. The majority of
sequences overlapping with predicted exons were
excluded from further analysis in view of the possibility that they were derived from messenger RNAs, and
only those with precursors presenting p-values below
0.01 were collected.
After loading small RNAs and mapping information,
small RNAs were sorted according to their position on
the reference genome. Each read start position was
examined to establish its similarity to a Drosha/Dicer
processing site. For each candidate site, the mature
sequence was extended to obtain two possible premiRNAs. One sequence encompassed 10 nt upstream
and 70 nt downstream, and the other included 70
upstream and 10 downstream of the respective miRNAs. The two possible pre-miRNAs were evaluated
using Mfold to determine ability to form characteristic
hairpin structures [56]. A well-designed computational
filter was employed to identify miRNA-like hairpins
[57]. RNAs displaying folding energy values ≤ -25 kcal/
mol were subjected to further analysis. Both miRNA
and miRNA* had to reside in different arms of a hairpin structure, each with no more than 6 unpaired
bases. We ensured that the maximum bulge over the
miRNA/miRNA* duplex was not more than 4 bases,
and asymmetry of the miRNA/miRNA* duplex equal
to or less than 3. In addition to the above requirements, sequencing of both miRNA and miRNA*
required that the miRNA/miRNA* duplex had 3’ overhangs at both ends, a typical feature of Drosha and
Dicer processing. Candidates corresponding to known
miRNAs deposited at the miRBase 14.0 [11] and supported by two reads of mature sequences were considered real miRNA genes.
The criteria used to identify novel miRNAs from
sequencing data of the three small RNA libraries were
as follows: (1) genomic loci annotated as known silkworm miRNAs or other classes of noncoding RNA
were excluded; (2) an individual locus had to be supported by a minimum of five independent sequence
reads originating from at least one small RNA library
to be considered for further analysis; (3) loci lacking
hairpin-like RNA secondary structures, including positions of the small RNA tags, were eliminated. The
resulting set of sequences and their respective RNA
structures were further analyzed to distinguish genuine
miRNA precursors from other RNAs containing similar RNA structures. All involved target sites were
predicted using RNAhybrid2.2 [58] and filtered
with MirTif [59]. The SVM score value was higher
than 1.0.

Additional file 1: The flow results of data filtration and distribution
of sequenced small RNAs across different categories. After sequential
filtration, the raw data in each library were separated into low and high
quality reads. High quality reads with at least 18 nt were differentiated
into categories of short sequencing reads, including rRNA, tRNA, snoRNA,
fragments of sense and antisense exons and introns of coding genes,
repeat sequences in transposable elements, unannotated short
sequencing reads and some annotated miRNAs. Novel miRNAs were
screened from unannotated sequencing reads and repeated sequences
in transposable elements. Final miRNA data in each library are

Additional file 3: Silkworm miRNAs identified by Solexa sequencing.
In all, 324 miRNA genes (loci) were identified in the silkworm genome,
responsible for 209 unique miRNAs and 87 star sequences, which were
screened from the raw data through flow data filtration. All known and
novel miRNAs have been submitted to the international public DataBase,
miRBase. The temporal names of novel miRNAs were replaced by the
assigned names. The bmo-mir-276 well mapped to Build 1, but not to
the Build2 genome sequence (blast 1e-5). Three new miRNAs, bmo-mir100, bmo-mir-92b and bmo-mir-216, did not pass the filtering threshold
due to their uncanonical hairpin structures, but were finally identified
through homolog searches. Another two annotated miRNAs, bmo-mir1920 and bmo-mir-1921, were not included in this file, since they
showed sequential processing in generating mature sequences and no
more accumulated reads were observed (Additional file 10). Several novel
miRNA genes have duplicated loci within the silkworm genome. The U
in the sequence was replaced with T, and sequences presented in the

Additional file 11: Closely clustered miRNAs of the silkworm. For our
analysis, groups of miRNA genes located within 2.5 kb of each other are
defined as clusters. The close proximity of these miRNA genes in each

polycistronic transcript. Actually, more clusters can be identified when
the space region is extended to a wider region than 2.5 kb.
