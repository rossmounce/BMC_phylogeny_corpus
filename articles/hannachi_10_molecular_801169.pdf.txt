Abstract
Background: In Tunisia, country of intermediate endemicity for Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, most molecular
studies on the virus have been carried out in the North of the country and little is known about other regions. The
aim of this study was to determine HBV genotype and subgenotypes in Central-East Tunisia. A total of 217 HBs
antigen positive patients were enrolled and determination of genotype was investigated in 130 patients with
detectable HBV DNA. HBV genotyping methods were: PCR-RFLP on the pre-S region, a PCR using type-specific
primers in the S region (TSP-PCR) and partial sequencing in the pre-S region.
Results: Three genotypes (D, B and A) were detected by the PCR-RFLP method and two (D and A) with the
TSP-PCR method, the concordance between the two methods was 93%. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of
32 strains, retrieved the same genotype (D and A) for samples with concordant results and genotype D for
samples with discordant results. The sequences of discordant genotypes had a restriction site in the pre-S gene
which led to erroneous result by the PCR-RFLP method. Thus, prevalence of genotype D and A was 96% and 4%,
respectively. Phylogenetic analysis showed the predominance of two subgenotypes D1 (55%) and D7 (41%). Only
one strain clustered with D3 subgenotype (3%).
Conclusions: Predominance of subgenotype D7 appears to occur in northern regions of Africa with transition to
subgenotype D1 in the East of the continent. HBV genetic variability may lead to wrong results in rapid
genotyping methods and sequence analysis is needed to clarify atypical results.

Background
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is one of the major
global health problems; more than 400 million persons
are chronically infected by HBV with high risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [1]. Several viral
factors influence the outcome of the infection such as
DNA levels, viral mutations and HBV genotypes [2,3].
Based on sequence divergence in the entire genome,
eight genotypes (A to H), differing by at least 8%, have
been identified [4,5]. Genotypes A to D and F have
been, recently, divided into multiple sub-genotypes with
a difference ranging from 4 to 8% in their nucleotide
sequences [1,3]. Sequencing is the gold standard to

classify HBV genotypes and sub-genotypes; however, the
method is expensive and fastidious [5]. To overcome
this problem, different techniques have been developed,
based on either PCR with type-specific primers, PCR
with restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)
or PCR-hybridization probe [6-8,5]. These rapid molecular methods have been performed in many countries for
epidemiological studies.
HBV genotypes have a characteristic geographical distribution: genotype A is prevalent in Europe, India,
Africa and America. Genotypes B and C are predominant in China, Japan and Southern Asia whereas genotype D is widespread in the Mediterranean area and the
Middle East region. Genotype E is found in patients
from West Africa and genotype F in Central and South
America. Genotype H has been described in Mexico and
Central America. Genotype G has been first identified in

France and the United States, and was recently detected
in Mexico [2].
Tunisia is a country with an intermediate HBV endemicity; prevalence of HBsAg range from 4 to 7% in the
general population [9]. The rate of HBsAg positivity varies widely from the north to the south of the country
[9,10]. Previous studies reported predominance of genotype D (over than 80%) with limited circulation of genotypes A, B, C and E [11,12]. For HBV subgenotypes,
only one study has been previously conducted with
description of a novel subgenotype named D7 [13]. All
these molecular studies were performed in the north
part of the country; no data are yet available in the
other regions.
The present work aimed to complete Tunisian data on
HBV genotypes and subgenotypes circulation. For this
purpose, this study was conducted on HBV infected
patients originating from the central part of Tunisia.
Two molecular approaches based either on a multiplexPCR using specific primers or RFLP were used to identify HBV genotypes. Partial sequencing was performed
to confirm the results obtained by these methods and to
study HBV subgenotypes.

Study design
Studied population

Our population included 217 patients infected by HBV
and recruited during the period from September 2007
to September 2008. All of these patients were previously
tested for HBsAg by immuno-enzymatic test (Abbott
AXSYM(r) HBsAg Assay) and were positive for this
marker. Patients aged from 7 to 80 year-old (mean age
36.38 ± 14.26 years) with a M/F sex ratio of 0.68. They
attended different primary care centers in the central
region of Tunisia (governorates of Sousse, Monastir,
Mahdia and Kairouan). Six patients with chronic hepatitis and two with cirrhosis were positive for HBeAg
(Table 1).
Viral DNA extraction and genotyping

HBV DNA was extracted from 200 μl of serum samples
using QIAamp DNA blood kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth,
CA). HBV DNA was detected by PCR amplification of
the fragment located between nucleotides 2823 and 80

in the Pre-S region of HBV genome, as described by
Lindh et al [7]. The sensitivity of this method was previously estimated to be 103 copies/ml.
Two genotyping methods were used:
- RFLP analysis of the fragment obtained by PCR
amplification in the Pre-S region: the amplification product was digested separately by AvaII and DpnII restriction enzymes with separation of the resulting DNA
fragments by electrophoresis in a 4% agarose gel stained
by ethidium bromide. Genotypes A to F of HBV were
identified by the obtained restriction patterns according
to Lindh et al [7].
- PCR amplification using type-specific primers (TSPPCR) described previously by Naito et al [6]: it is a
nested PCR with a first amplification of a 1063 fragment
located between nucleotides 2823 and 704 in the Pre-S
and S regions of the genome followed by a second
amplification with two separate mixtures A and B.
These mixtures allow specific detection of genotypes A
(68 bp), B (281 bp), and C (122 bp) for the first one and
genotypes D (119 bp), E (167 bp), and F (97 bp) for the
second.
These two genotyping methods are unable to identify
genotype G and H. Both HBV genotyping methods were
performed on all patients’ specimens.
Sequencing was performed with a BigDye Terminator
Cycle Sequencing kit on an ABI 3130 automated
sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany),
with the same primers as those used for PCR amplification of pre-S region. The sequences obtained were compared with published sequences from the same genomic
region available in GenBank.
Alignment was performed using CLUSTAL W method
in MEGA 4.1 software. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbour-joining algorithm of
MEGA4.1. software, with 1000 Bootstrap replicates.

Results
Sixty percent of patients (n = 130 out of 217) were positive by PCR amplification in the pre-S region. HBV
DNA was detected for all patients with positive HBeAg
and for 58% with positive anti-HBe sera. Table 1 shows
the HBe Ag status and the PCR amplification results in
the studied population.
PCR-RFLP and TSP-PCR were successfully assessed
for the 130 samples with detectable HBV DNA. Three
HBV genotypes were detected by PCR-RFLP: D, A and
B (Figure 1). Genotype D was observed in 89% of the
cases with a restriction pattern corresponding to D2
(undigested with Ava II and bands 306 pb, 88 pb, 52 pb
with Dpn II). Genotype A was detected in 4% of the
cases with specific RFLP profile of A1 pattern (301 pb,
121 pb, 57 pb with AvaII and 318 pb, 109 pb and 52 pb
with DpnII). In 7% of the cases, a restriction profile

corresponding to genotype B was observed (matching
with B6 pattern: 319 pb and 160 bp with Ava II and 318
pb, 109 pb and 52 pb with DpnII). This profile was
observed in 5 cirrhotic cases.
Different results were provided by TSP-PCR: only two
genotypes, D and A, were detected in 96% and 4% of
the samples, respectively. Concordance with PCR-RFLP
was found in 93% of the cases (121/130). The nine cases
classified as genotype B by PCR-RFLP were identified as
genotype D by TSP-PCR.
Partial sequencing in the pre-S region was performed
for 32 samples: seven of nine samples with discordant
results by the two methods used and 25 with concordant results (24 with genotype D and 1 with genotype
A). Figure 2 shows a phylogenetic tree obtained after
comparison with selected sequences from GenBank.
Phylogenetic analysis confirmed the concordant results
between the two genotyping methods. For the 7 samples
with discordant genotype results, the genotype determined through sequencing was D (Table 2). Thus, real
frequencies of genotype D and A strains were 96% and
4% respectively.
Analysis of the region located between nucleotides
2823 and 80 in pre-S gene in samples giving erroneous
result with the RFLP method revealed the presence of
an additional restriction site for AvaII in our sequences.
The new restriction site resulted in an additional fragment of 160 pb. The presence of the same site of
restriction in this region of genotype D strains was also
observed in 8 sequences available in GenBank under the
following assession numbers: DQ464170, EU594406,
AB109478, AY796031, FJ349235, FJ001987, FJ904365
and FJ904433[13-17].
Among the 31 genotype D strains, phylogenetic analysis showed predominance of subgenotypes D1 (54%).

A total of 13 samples (41%) clustered into the novel D7
subgenotype group and just one belonged to D3 subgenotype (3%).

Discussion
Our study, conducted for the first time in a population
from the Central-East of Tunisia, identified genotype D
as the most prevalent in this region. These findings are
concordant with previous studies conducted in the
North of the country where genotype D was detected in
more than 90% of chronic hepatitis B cases [11-13]. All
these results from different regions confirm that genotype D is largely circulating in the country. Globally,
this genotype is known by its high prevalence in the
Mediterranean area, the near and middle east, and south
Asia and its high risk of provoking fulminant hepatitis.
It is also responsible of severe chronic liver diseases
more frequently than other genotypes [1,3,18]. Genotype
D is also known to be frequently associated with precore mutants which increase the risk of evolution to cirrhosis and HCC [11]. This type of mutants seems to be
frequent in our population in view of the fact that 59%
of the patients are characterized by the absence of
HBeAg but detectable HBV DNA.
Beside genotype D, only genotype A was detected
from a few samples in our study. Genotype A was previously identified in 6 to 8% of Tunisian patients in cocirculation with genotypes B, C and E [11-13]. The lack
of detection of these latest genotypes, in our study,
could be explained by the origin of our patients which
was different from what described previously or by the
techniques used which have different sensitivity to
detect genotypes [19]. Indeed, genotype G and H were
not investigated for all patients because the two rapid
methods do not allow identification of these genotypes.

Figure 2 Phylogenetic analysis based on 86 sequences of 431
nucleotides within the HBsAg region. The evolutionary history was
inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method. The evolutionary distances
were computed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method
and are in the units of the number of base substitutions per site. There
were a total of 431 positions in the final dataset. Phylogenetic analyses
were conducted in MEGA4. Sequences from patients included in this
study are labeled with a red dot. Reference sequences are indicated by
their accession number.

Yet, sequencing performed for 32 of our strains did not
objective their presence. As reported by previous studies
conducted in Tunisians, these two genotypes seem to be
not circulating in our country. However, more investigations should be performed, especially for genotype G
which was previously described in a Mediterranean
country (France) [2].
For HBV genotyping, three methods were used, PCRRFLP, TSP-PCR and partial sequencing; discordant
results were observed between PCR-RFLP and TSP-PCR
especially for genotype B. Discordance between these
two methods can be related to the high variability of
HBV genome which results in changes of enzyme
restriction sites, suppressing known sites or creating

new ones. These later modifications may lead to erroneous results with RFLP methods [19,20]. Analysis of
our sequences is in agreement with this methodological
artefact. Indeed, it revealed the presence of an additional
restriction site for Ava-II in the pre-S region which has
not been described previously [7]. Furthermore, this
additional site is also present in other sequences deposited in Genbank by several authors [13-17]. This restriction site resulted, in our study, in an additional
fragment of 160 pb with a RFLP pattern of genotype B
but it did not interfere with results of other studies relying on sequencing methods and which succeeded in
identifying genotype D [13-17]. For this reason, results
obtained by PCR-RFLP should be carefully analyzed
because introduction of new restriction site in targeted
sequences can lead to erroneous results with this technique [21]. The genotyping based on this RFLP method is
largely used for epidemiological studies because it is
easy to perform but this approach suffers some limits
especially in area with high prevalence of genotype D
[22-25].
Sequencing, performed for discordant samples, gave
fully concordant results to those obtained by TSPPCR; thus, it reveals the high efficiency of this later
method [6,7]. Lim et al have also previously reported
more specific results by TSP-PCR in comparison to a
PCR-RFLP based method described by Lindh et al. in
1998 [26]. The principal advantage of TSP-PCR is the
region of the genome targeted by this method; in fact,
TSP-PCR amplifies part of the S region which is
known to be more accurate for genotypic determination than the pre-S gene amplified by PCR-RFLP
[26,27]. The bias observed between the two PCR based
methods could then be simply due to the region used
for genotyping.
In addition to the risk of erroneous results, the limit
of the rapid methods using classic PCR is the low sensitivity of DNA detection (the limit of detection of our
method being 10 3 copies/ml). This explains that the
genotyping method was performed for only 60% of positive HBs Ag patients in our study. Due to this lower
sensitivity, one cannot exclude that genotype distribution studied with our method may be slightly biased on
samples with higher viral load. Confirmation of our
findings with a more sensitive technique would be of
interest.
Phylogenetic analysis and comparison to other Tunisian sequences of genotype D revealed high identity
between sequences and identified two subgenotypes for
our patients, D7 (41%) and D1 (56%). D7 is a novel subgenotype identified, for the first time, by Meldal et al in
59% of Tunisian patients [13]. Data from Algeria and
Morrocco suggested the predominance of this new subgenotype in the region [23,28]. Subgenotype D1 is

Page 5 of 6

predominant in the Eastern part of Africa; Saudy et al
described it in Egypt [29]. Our region geographically
located between northern Africa and the east of the continent seems to be a transition zone between subgenotype D7 and subgenotype D1. Subgenotype D3 was
observed in only few cases in our study and is related to
Italian sequences; this result reflects probably regular
human migration between Tunisia and Italy. Limitation
of our study is obviously the relative short fragment studied to construct our phylogenetic analyses with the risk
of poor discrimination between subtypes or even misclassification. Although this approach might be sufficient for
screening, complete genome based genotyping is certainly required for accurate classification. In our study we
did not find any correlation between clinical status and D
subgenotype; further works including a larger proportion
of inactive carriers are needed to confirm our findings.
In conclusion, our study completes previous Tunisian
data and confirms the predominance of genotype D and
subgenotypes D1 and D7. Our comparison between two
simple genotyping methods that are largely used for epidemiological studies demonstrates the importance of
sequencing to confirm results when the results are
discordant.
