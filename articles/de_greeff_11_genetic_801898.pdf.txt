Abstract
Background: Streptococcus suis is a zoonotic pathogen that causes infections in young piglets. S. suis is a
heterogeneous species. Thirty-three different capsular serotypes have been described, that differ in virulence
between as well as within serotypes.
Results: In this study, the correlation between gene content, serotype, phenotype and virulence among 55 S. suis
strains was studied using Comparative Genome Hybridization (CGH). Clustering of CGH data divided S. suis isolates
into two clusters, A and B. Cluster A isolates could be discriminated from cluster B isolates based on the protein
expression of extracellular factor (EF). Cluster A contained serotype 1 and 2 isolates that were correlated with
virulence. Cluster B mainly contained serotype 7 and 9 isolates. Genetic similarity was observed between serotype
7 and serotype 2 isolates that do not express muramidase released protein (MRP) and EF (MRP-EF-), suggesting
these isolates originated from a common founder. Profiles of 25 putative virulence-associated genes of S. suis were
determined among the 55 isolates. Presence of all 25 genes was shown for cluster A isolates, whereas cluster B
isolates lacked one or more putative virulence genes. Divergence of S. suis isolates was further studied based on
the presence of 39 regions of difference. Conservation of genes was evaluated by the definition of a core genome
that contained 78% of all ORFs in P1/7.
Conclusions: In conclusion, we show that CGH is a valuable method to study distribution of genes or gene
clusters among isolates in detail, yielding information on genetic similarity, and virulence traits of S. suis isolates.

Background
Streptococcus suis forms a problem in the swine industry. Clinically healthy sows carry S. suis in their nasal
cavities and on their tonsils, and transmit the bacteria to
their piglets [1], that develop a variety of infections, such
as septicaemia, meningitis, polyarthritis, and endocarditis, and often do not survive [2]. S. suis occasionally
causes meningitis, arthritis or endocarditis in humans.
However, recently several large human outbreaks of S.
suis have been described in China [3,4], and Thailand
[5], whilst S. suis meningitis has become endemic in
Vietnam [6,7], suggesting that isolates that are more
virulent to humans have emerged.

The S. suis population is very heterogeneous as different serotypes, phenotypes, and genotypes are found. To
date 33 capsular serotypes have been described for S.
suis [2,8] of which serotypes 1, 2, 7, 9, and 14 are most
frequently isolated from diseased pigs in Europe [9]. In
Northern America, besides these serotypes, serotypes 3
and 8 are frequently isolated from diseased animals
[10,11]. On European farms, it was shown that up to
81% of healthy animals carried one or more serotypes
simultaneously and different genotypes of the same serotype could be isolated at one timepoint from the same
animal [12]. Different phenotypes of serotype 2 were
described that differ in their virulence; strains can be
differentiated by protein expression of virulence markers
muramidase released protein (MRP), extracellular factor
(EF) and suilysin (SLY) [13,14]. Besides variation in protein expression observed among S. suis strains, large

heterogeneity also exists in gene composition [10,15-17].
Recently, the genome sequence of S. suis serotype 2
strain P1/7 became available [7] enabling whole genome
typing techniques for S. suis. In the present study, we
performed oligonucleotide-based comparative genome
hybridization (CGH) using the genome sequence of
strain P1/7 to evaluate gene conservation and diversity
among S. suis strains. Fifty-five well characterized S. suis
strains of various serotypes were analyzed in this CGH
study. Results from CGH were clustered, and correlated
with MLST data, serotyping results, and virulence of
strains. We showed that groups of S. suis isolates can be
identified by their own unique profile of putative virulence genes and regions of difference. Besides, a core
genome for S. suis was defined.

prior predisposition to B. bronchiseptica. Piglets were
kept in sternal position and forced to inhale an aerosol
produced by an airbrush (Badger, Franklin Park, USA)
after anaesthesia with 50% O2/50% N2O/3% halothane.
In all experiments, piglets were followed clinically with
special regard to signs of meningitis and arthritis. Swabs
for bacteriological examination were taken daily from
the oropharynx and faeces. Pigs were killed either moribund or 18 days post infection at the end of the observation period by intravenous injection of
pentobarbiturate followed by exsanguination and
necropsy. Tissue specimens from the central nervous
system (CNS), serosae, and joints were examined bacteriologically and histologically [21,23].

Methods
Bacterial strains and growth conditions

Bacterial isolates are described in Table 1. S. suis strains
were grown on Columbia agar blood base plates (Oxoid
Ltd., London, United Kingdom) containing 6% (vol/vol)
horse blood. Cultures were grown in Todd-Hewitt broth
(Oxoid). Escherichia coli was grown in Luria Broth
(Oxoid) and plated on Luria Broth Agar (Oxoid). S. suis
isolates used in this study were serotyped using the
slide-agglutination test [18] before they were used in the
study (Table 1). Expression of three virulence markers,
MRP, EF, and SLY [19,20] was confirmed for all isolates
by Western blot analysis [9] using monoclonal antibodies against MRP, EF [21], or SLY [22] (Table 1).
Experimental infection in pigs

All animal experiments were approved by the ethical
committee of the Central Veterinary Institute of Wageningen UR in accordance with the Dutch law on animal
experiments.
In this study virulence of S. suis isolates was strictly
defined by the outcome of experimental infections. To
study virulence of S. suis serotype 1 and 9 isolates, three
successive experiments were performed in pigs. Previous
to infection all piglets were tested negative for S. suis
carriership. In all experiments pigs were allotted to
three or four groups each consisting of four or five pigs
(Table 2). In the first two experiments seventeen caesarian-derived germfree piglets were housed in stainless
steel incubators as described before [21]. Each piglet
was infected at the age of 5 days with Bordetella bronchiseptica (3 × 107 CFU, intranasally) to predispose animals for subsequent S. suis infection. Two days later
animals were infected intranasally with exponentially
growing S. suis strains (1 × 106 CFU aerosol).
In the third experiment, specific pathogen free (SPF)
piglets with the age of 6 weeks were infected intranasally
with S. suis serotype 9 isolates (1 × 109 CFU) without

MLST was performed as described by King et al. [24].
Alternative primers for mutS were used as described
previously by Rehm et al. [25]. Chromosomal DNA was
isolated from stationary growing bacteria as described
previously [26]. PCR reactions were performed using
Taq PCR Core kit (QIAgen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, using 5 μl of
diluted (1:100) chromosomal DNA as template, containing at least 350 ng of DNA. PCR products were visually
inspected on 1% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide, and subsequently purified and sequenced by
Macrogen (Macrogen, Seoul, Korea). Sequence data
were analyzed using Lasergene software (DNAstar,
Madison, USA). MLST alleles and resulting STs were
assigned using the database on http://ssuis.mlst.net/.
New alleles and STs were assigned by the curator of the
database. Analysis of ST complexes was performed with
eBURST http://www.mlst.net[27].
S. suis oligoarray

A S. suis oligoarray (8 × 15 K) containing in situ synthesized 60-mers was produced by Agilent Technologies
(Santa Clara, USA), according to a custom probe design
based on the genome sequence of S. suis P1/7 [7]. A
total of 7651 unique 60-mers having a theoretical melting temperature of approximately 81°C and representing
1960 ORFs were selected as described by Saulnier et al.
[28]. Genes were represented by 4 (91%), 3 (4%), 2 (2%),
or 1 probe (3%). A total of 25 putative genes were not
represented on the array because no unique probe satisfying the selection criteria could be selected.
Comparative genome hybridization (CGH)

Chromosomal DNA (50 μg) was sheared in 1 ml shearing
buffer (TE/10% glycerol), using Nebulizers (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, USA) under 1.7 bar air pressure for 3 minutes to
yield fragments between 500 and 1500 bp. DNA was ethanol precipitated, taken up in water and 10 μg of DNA was

column purified using Illustra Cyscribe GFX purification
kit (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) according to
instructions of the manufacturer. Differential DNA presence was determined by two-colour fluorescent hybridizations of the corresponding genomic DNAs on the 8 ×
15 k S. suis oligo array. Genomic DNA of each strain was
cohybridized once with the reference strain P1/7, that was
always labeled with Cy3. The test strain was consequently
labeled with Cy5. Labeling of DNA (2,5 μg) was done
using the Bioprime Array CGH Genomic Labeling System
(Invitrogen) with slight modifications as described by
Molenaar et al., 2005 [29]. Labeling efficiency was measured using the Nanodrop (ThermoScientific, Wilmington,
USA). Constant amounts of label (25 pmol each) were
hybridized to the oligoarray in hybridization buffer of the
In situ hybridization kit Plus (Agilent Technologies) following instructions of the manufacturer. During hybridization, slides were incubated for 17 h at 65°C under rotation.
Slides were washed for 10 min in 6 × SSC/0.05% TritonX102 at room temperature, followed by 5 min in 0.1 ×
SSC/0.05% Triton-X102 at 4°C. Slides were dried using
pressured air and scanned in a GenePix 4200AL scanner
(Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, USA). Scans were analyzed
using GenePix software (Molecular Devices). Local background values were subtracted from the intensity of each
spot. Data were normalized using S-Lowess [30] at the
webtool accessible from http://bioinformatics.biol.rug.nl/
websoftware/s-lowess. Normalized data were imported
into Acuity software (Molecular Devices) for further analysis. Cut-off values for presence/absence of genes were
empirically determined by comparing microarray results
to classic hybridization results using about 100 radioactively labeled probes on spotted chromosomal DNA (data

not shown). It was determined that a log ratio above -1.5
indicated the gene was present and very homologous to
the gene in P1/7, whereas a log ratio above -4.5 indicated
that the gene was present, but variation in nucleotide
composition existed among isolates. A ratio between -1.5
and -3 indicated slight variation, whereas a ratio between
-3 and -4.5 indicated large variation. A gene was designated “absent” from a genome when all probes for that
gene had a normalized log ratio below -4.5.
Dendrograms

CGH data was clustered using Acuity software to determine similarity of isolates tested in the CGH. Hierarchical clustering of isolates was done by clustering arrays
based on ranked correlation coefficients (Spearman’s
rho), where linkage was determined using the average
neighbours method. P-values were calculated by multiscale bootstrap resampling (n = 10000) with the R package pvclust using the average agglomerative method and
by the absolute correlative distance measure. The presence of putative virulence genes among isolates, as well
as the presence of regions of difference among isolates,
was visualized in dendrograms using BioNumerics
(Applied Maths, Houston, USA) to study similarity
among isolates. These data were analyzed using the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient. Cluster analysis was done with the unweighted pair group method
using arithmetic averages (UPGMA) with a 1% optimization for position tolerance.
Microarray data

All microarray data have been submitted MIAME complied to ArrayExpress under submission numbers

Results
Clustering of isolates as determined by CGH

CGH was used to study genomic diversity among S. suis
isolates. S. suis isolates from different serotypes, isolated
from different hosts, from different clinical sources, and
from different geographical locations were included in
the study (Table 1). The dendrogram depicting the
CGH data (Figure 1) shows that isolates were divided
into 2 clusters, A and B, whereas the negative control E.
coli strain was assigned to cluster C. This indicates that
there are extensive genetic differences between S. suis
isolates belonging to clusters A and B. Statistical analysis
showed that subclustering of isolates in cluster B was
highly significant (indicated in Figure 1), whereas subclustering of isolates in cluster A was less significant.
This is probably due to high similarity among cluster A
isolates. One statistical outlier was identified, isolate
6388 clustered with E. coli (p = 0.6) in a separate cluster
due to low microarray signals. This was only detected
after multiple bootstrap resampling.
Cluster A exclusively contained serotype 1 and 2 isolates, except for one (isolate 2840), indicating that these

serotypes are genetically very similar. Isolate 2840 was
identified to be poly-agglutinable in a slide agglutination
test, although CGH data showed this isolate contains cps
genes of serotype 2, suggesting the isolate belongs to serotype 2 but does not express (enough) capsule genes sufficiently to be detected in slide agglutination. All isolates
in cluster A expressed either EF protein or the larger
form EF* protein [16], whereas none of the isolates clustered in group B expressed either of these proteins.
MLST analysis showed that with the exception of serotype 2 isolate 1890, all isolates in cluster A belonged to
clonal complex 1 (CC1) within which most isolates were
found to represent sequence type 1 (ST1) whereas others
represented single locus variants of ST1. Six subclusters
(A1 - A6) were distinguished in cluster A. Cluster A1
contained MRP + EF + serotype 2 isolates from different
geographical locations (Canada, Netherlands and China)
that were isolated from humans and pigs, indicating the
global spreading of these isolates. Cluster A2 exclusively
contained serotype 2 isolates from Vietnam either
obtained from human patients or from pigs [6], suggesting these Vietnamese isolates are highly similar to each
other. Discrimination of isolates of the subclusters A1 A6 was based on sequence diversity between genes,
rather than on differences in gene content.

In contrast to cluster A, cluster B contained a more
divergent, heterogeneous group of isolates. Cluster B
contained all serotype 7 and 9 isolates included in this
study as well as a number of less virulent serotype 1
and serotype 2 isolates that neither express MRP nor
EF. Within cluster B five subclusters were distinguished
(B1 - B5). Subclusters B1 and B2 contained all serotype
7 isolates, as well as a number of MRP-EF- serotype 2
isolates [21]. The high degree of similarity observed
between MRP - EF - serotype 2 and serotype 7 isolates
could suggest that the MRP-EF- serotype 2 isolates originated from serotype 7 isolates by an exchange of capsular genes. This idea is supported by MLST data which
showed that most isolates within the clusters B1 and B2
share the same clonal complex (respectively 16 and 29)
as well as by AFLP-data in which these isolates also
clustered together (data not shown). Cluster B3 was a
very heterogeneous group of isolates that seemed to
contain isolates that were clustered based on lack of
genetic similarity to each other and to other strains.
Surprisingly, the reference strain of serotype 9 (22083R9)
was assigned to cluster B3 as well, at large distance
from other serotype 9 isolates in cluster B5. This clearly
indicates that the reference strain does not represent the
European serotype 9 isolates from the field used in this
study. This was confirmed by MLST data, since this
reference strain was assigned to ST82, an independent
ST, outside a lineage. Cluster B4 contained two serotype
1 isolates among which the reference strain of serotype
1 (NCTC10273R1), indicating extensive sequence differences between serotype 1 strains in cluster B4 and serotype 1 strains in cluster A. In contrast to the serotype 1
isolates present in cluster A, both isolates in cluster B4
were negative for expression of MRP and EF and
belonged to CC13, whereas all serotype 1 isolates in
cluster A belonged to CC1. Therefore, the reference
strain for serotype 1 at best represents part of the serotype 1 population. Cluster B5 contained serotype 9 isolates belonging to CC16 as well as a serotype 2 isolate
from a human patient and a serotype 4 isolate both
belonging to CC147.
Virulence of S. suis isolates of serotype 1 and 9

To be able to study the correlation of gene content of
isolates with virulence, we determined the virulence of
serotype 1 and 9 isolates used in this study in experimental infections in pigs in comparison to the virulence
of serotype 2 strain 3 [21]. The reference strains of serotype 1 and 9 were included in this experimental infection, as well as 2 - 3 field isolates of both serotypes.
Table 2 shows that although serotype 1 reference strain
NCTC10273R1 showed less clinical signs than serotype 2
strain 3, mortality of serotype 1 reference strain was
100% whereas strain 2 showed only 50% mortality. Four

Page 7 of 15

piglets infected with this serotype 1 strain showed
pathological abnormalities in joints. Based on morbidity,
mortality and pathological abnormalities in > 50% of
piglets, isolate NCTC10273R1 is considered virulent, like
strain 3. Serotype 1 isolates 6112 and 6388 also showed
a mortality rate of 100%. The mean number of days
until death of these animals was 2 days, whereas for piglets infected with the serotype 1 reference strain this
was 9.8 days. Animals infected with strain 3 showed
50% mortality and a mean number of days until death
of more than 7 days post-infection. Isolates 6112 and
6388 induced pathological abnormalities in CNS in 4
out of 5 piglets and 3 out of 5 piglets, respectively.
Based on these observations, these serotype 1 isolates
are considered more virulent than strain 3 and are
therefore considered highly virulent. Serotype 9 isolates
did not show any clinical symptoms after an intranasal
infection with 10 6 CFU (Table 2), whereas strain 3
showed 50% mortality and a mean number of days until
death of 7.5. Even an infection dose of 109 CFU of serotype 9 only induced mild clinical signs, and sparse
pathological findings. This led to the conclusion that the
serotype 9 isolates tested in our experimental infection
model should be considered avirulent, although they can
induce mild clinical symptoms at a higher dose.
Virulence of isolates as determined in experimental
infections in pigs was depicted in the dendrogram of
CGH data (Figure 1). Except for the virulent reference
strain of serotype 1 that was assigned to cluster B4, all
avirulent isolates were assigned to cluster B, whereas all
virulent, highly virulent and weakly virulent isolates
were assigned to cluster A. MLST data confirmed these
findings, since all isolates in cluster A, except for isolate
1890, belonged to MLST CC1 that was described to
have a strong correlation with invasive diseases, like septicemia, meningitis and arthritis [24]. All Asian human
isolates that were obtained from meningitis and sepsis
patients were assigned to cluster A as well. The only
Dutch human isolate from a meningitis patient (isolate
25) was shown to be avirulent in an experimental infection in piglets, and was assigned to cluster B, clearly
indicating that this isolate is genetically distinct from
the highly virulent Asian human isolates [3,4].
Distribution of putative virulence related genes among S.
suis serotype 2 isolates

To correlate virulence of isolates with specific genes, we
next studied the distribution of 25 genes encoding putative virulence proteins in serotype 2 isolates among isolates. Genes were selected that were described to be
involved in pathogenesis or virulence of S. suis. Clustering of these results into a dendrogram assigned all isolates to 7 different virulence clusters (V1 - V7) (Figure
2). This clustering was very similar to the clustering

annotated genome sequence of P1/7 [7]. Presence of 25 described putative virulence factors was studied: muramidase released protein (mrp),
and extracullar factor (epf) [13], suilysin (sly) [20], sortases (srtA, srtBCD, srtF) [34], surface antigen one (sao) [42], hyaluronidase (hylA) [17,43],
opacity factor (ofs) [37], fibronectin binding protein (fbps) [44], arginin deiminase (arcA) [45], glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh)
[46], regulator of virulence (revS) [35,47], enolase (eno) [48], glutamine synthetase (glnA) [49], igA1 protease [36], inosine 5-monophosphate
dehydrogenase (impdh) [50], dipeptidyl peptidase IV (dppIV) [51], ferrous iron transporter (feoB) [52], subtilisin like serine protease (sspA) [53],
amylopullulanase (apuA) [54], ferric uptake regulator (fur), and adhesion competence repressor (adcR) [55]. * hylA is present as pseudogene in P1/

(present with large variation); ‘-’ indicates one or more probes have a ratio < -4.5 (partly or completely absent).

based on the CGH data, although some isolates were
clustered with isolates that belonged to another CGH
cluster. Isolates assigned to cluster V4 (corresponding to
CGH cluster A) contained all selected putative virulence
genes, whereas isolates assigned to clusters V1, V2, V3,
V5, V6 and V7 (corresponding to CGH cluster B) lacked
1 to 12 of these genes. All cluster B isolates lacked
either one or more sortase genes that are involved in
assembly of pili [31]. Serotype 7 isolates all clustered to
V1 together with MRP-EF- serotype 2 isolates. All V1
isolates lacked regulator of virulence revS, epf and srtB
and srtC, whereas they contained srtE, srtF and two isolates contained srtD, but with extensive sequence variation. Serotype 9 isolates fell apart in two different
clusters, V6 and V7. Cluster V6 lacked IgA protease,
srtF, and epf, and showed minor sequence variation in
apuA and fbps. V7 isolates lacked at least 11 putative
virulence genes, among which all sortase genes. This
indicated that V7 isolates are incapable of pilus formation, and are thereby likely to be less virulent. Taken
together, our data suggests that differences in virulence
exist within the serotype 9 population. Extensive
sequence variation in a limited number of putative virulence genes (glnA, ofs, IgA protease, apuA, fbps, srtD)
was detected in isolates belonging to clusters V1, V2,
V3, V5, V6 and V7, but not in V4 isolates (Figure 2).
This suggests that V4 isolates are genetically more similar to each other and to P1/7, the array strain. V4 isolates exclusively express EF, none of the isolates in
clusters V1, V2, V3, V5, V6 express EF (Table 1). In this
study we show that most isolates are unable to express
the protein since they lacked the epf gene encoding EF.
Two V5 isolates have a silent epf gene. Presence of mrp
and sly genes was less indicative for protein expression.
Isolates 3995, 3988, OV209, 15009, and 5973 contained
the suilysin gene, but did not express the protein under
in vitro conditions (Table 1). Almost all isolates tested
in this study contained the mrp gene, whereas less than
half expressed the protein under in vitro conditions
(Table 1 and Figure 2) [13].
Regions of differences and core genome of S. suis

To further explore genetic diversity between S. suis
isolates, regions of difference (RDs) were identified,
which were defined as at least three consecutive ORFs
that were absent from at least one strain. Thirty-nine
RDs that varied in size from 461 bp to 27 kbp were
identified. The largest RD (27 kbp) contained cps
genes encoding serotype specific polysaccharide capsule of P1/7 (serotype 2) (Table 3). Other RDs contained ABC transporters, restriction modification
systems, signal peptidases (srtE, srtF), several transporters, two-component systems and several other genes
(Table 3).

Page 9 of 15

Clustering of RD distribution among isolates in a dendrogram resulted in an identical clustering compared to
CGH clustering, indicating that RDs mainly determine
the differences between isolates as detected by CGH
(Figure 3). Within cluster A, subclusters could not be
discriminated based on the absence/presence of specific
RDs, since most RDs were universally present within
cluster A isolates. Distribution of RDs among cluster B
was more heterogeneous. Three isolates from cluster B3
(22083R1, 8186 and OV640) were responsible for a good
deal of diversity: 9 RDs representing 45 genes were only
absent in one or more of these isolates; whereas in total
at least 29 RDs are missing from these isolates. Thus,
these isolates are atypical within our selection of isolates. Serotype 7 and 9 isolates (in clusters B2 and B5)
also lacked considerable numbers of RDs. For some RDs
(RD1, RD6, RD17), GC content differed considerably
from overall GC content of the genome (41%), indicating these RDs might have been acquired from other species by horizontal gene transfer, since foreign DNA can
often be recognized by its variation from the majority of
the genome in base composition or codon preference.
The gene content of RDs shows that these regions contain specific beneficial traits like RM systems, ABC
transporters, or two-component systems, making it
attractive regions to acquire.
A core genome for S. suis was defined by selecting
genes that were present in all S. suis isolates tested. The
resulting core genome of S. suis consisted of 1492 genes
(76%) out of 1960 genes present on our array. Of those
1492 genes, 26 genes represent pseudogenes in P1/7.
Composition of the core genome of S. suis was studied
using the classification in clusters of orthologous groups
of proteins (COG). Figure 4 displays the relative representation of each COG category in both P1/7 as well as
in the core genome. Most COG categories were equally
represented in both genomes. However, COG categories
J (translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis), E
(amino acid transport and metabolism) and F (nucleotide transport and metabolism) were found to be overrepresented in the core genome. In conclusion, all isolates
in our study share 1492 genes. The overrepresentation
of the structural gene categories J, E, and F suggest this
core genome suffices for growth, division and survival,
whereas additional, beneficial traits are mainly encoded
by RDs.

Discussion
Comparative genome hybridization (CGH) was used to
study genetic heterogeneity among a collection of 55 S.
suis isolates. S. suis isolates were assigned to two clusters (A and B).
CGH data was compared with MLST and pulse field
gel electrophoresis (PFGE) [6] and amplified fragment

analysis, since isolates that belong to MLST CC1 can be
divided into subclusters using CGH. Moreover,

types, were assigned to the same CGH subcluster [6].

[7]. These changes can be discriminated by PFGE, but
not by CGH.
To correlate virulence of isolates to CGH results, virulence of serotype 1 and serotype 9 isolates was determined in an experimental infection. For serotype 1, our
animal experiment showed that in contrast to the field
isolates, the reference strain was not highly virulent.
Since serotype 9 only induced clinical symptoms at very
high doses, we concluded that serotype 9 isolates were
avirulent under experimental conditions. This was confirmed by other studies [32,33]. To correlate virulence
to CGH data, distribution of 25 putative virulence genes
among S. suis isolates was studied. Each CGH cluster
was shown to be associated with a specific profile of
putative virulence genes. Cluster A isolates contained all
25 putative virulence genes. Cluster B isolates on the
contrary lacked up to 12 putative virulence genes
among which one or more of sortase genes (srtBCD,
srtE, srtF) that are involved in assembly of pili [31,34].

In agreement with data presented here, Takamatsu et al.
showed that CC1 isolates contained all srt genes,
whereas CC29 isolates lacked srtBCD genes [34]. However, none of our serotype 9 isolates contained the
srtBCD gene cluster, whereas this cluster was detected
in a Japanese serotype 9 isolate [34]. This could imply
geographical variation. Moreover, the revs gene is absent
from all cluster B isolates, with the exception of cluster
B5 isolates. This regulator influences expression of putative virulence factors [35]. Therefore, lack of revs might
affect virulence of isolates. The IgA1 protease gene was
found to be absent in all serotype 9 isolates, and displayed extensive sequence variation in serotype 7 isolates. All serotype 2 isolates including the avirulent
isolates contained the IgA1 protease gene. Zhang et al.
showed that most pathogenic serotype 2 isolates contained the IgA1 protease gene, whereas the gene was
sparsely found in non-invasive serotype 2 isolates [36].
In the latter study mainly isolates obtained in China

de Greeff et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:161
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/161

were used. Sequence variation among isolates belonging
to cluster B was observed for other putative virulence
genes as well, like ofs, glnA, fbps and apuA. The ofs gene
was highly conserved among virulent serotype 1 and 2
isolates but showed extensive sequence diversity in
avirulent serotype 2 and serotype 7 isolates, as was also
described by Takamatsu et al [15]. Interestingly, at least
two of the ofs positive serotype 7 strains do not express
OFS in vitro, as shown in the serum opacification assay
[37]. This suggests the presence of silent ofs genes. A
silent epf gene was present in isolates in cluster B3. Two
of the B3 isolates (22083 R1 and 8186) expressed the
enlarged version of MRP, but none of the probes used
for the CGH hybridized to the mrp gene, suggesting
extensive sequence variation exists between different
serotype 9 isolates. The presence of a mrp gene in the
two isolates was confirmed by PCR analysis (data not
shown). Serotype 9 isolates were distributed among 2
virulence clusters, V6 and V7 that differed considerably
in their distribution of putative virulence genes. This
suggests differences in virulence exist among serotype 9
isolates that were not identified in our experimental
infection model.
Avirulent MRP - EF - serotype 2 isolates clustered
together with serotype 7 isolates both by CGH as well
as by MLST. Such a clustering is in agreement with previous studies [24,25]. The clustering strongly suggests
similarity in genetic background between the isolates
and could suggest that the avirulent serotype 2 isolates
originated from serotype 7 isolates after the exchange of
the capsular genes. Capsular exchange has been
described for other streptococci like GBS [38] and Streptococcus pneumonia [39]. In this study 39 regions of differences (RDs) were identified, that might contribute to
virulence or survival in the host based on the predicted
functions of the genes associated with the various RDs.
For example 3 RDs encode two-component regulatory
systems and 5 RDs encode putative virulence genes. In
addition, 6 phosphotransferase systems, and 4 ABC
transporters were identified. Since the GC content of
some RDs differed considerably compared to the whole
genome of S. suis, these RDs could have originated from
horizontal gene transfer. This suggestion can be supported by the finding that many RDs contained transposases, integrases or phage proteins which are all
involved in gene transfer.
A core genome for S. suis was defined that contained
78% of P1/7 ORFs. This percentage is in the same order
of magnitude as for other streptococcal core genomes.
A small percentage (2.4%) of the core genome is represented by pseudogenes in P1/7. Since single nucleotide
differences cannot be detected using CGH, additional
putative pseudogenes present in other isolates will not
be identified. This could lead to a small overestimation

Page 13 of 15

of the core genome. In P1/7 COG category G, carbohydrate transport and metabolism, is overrepresented
compared to the core genome. This could reflect genes
that are not essential to S. suis, but make S. suis strains
carrying these gene(s) more versatile in their carbon
source usage. Recent publications suggest carbon source
usage may be an important virulence trait for streptococci [40], which implies the more versatile S. suis isolates could benefit in pathogenesis. Since the core
genome includes genes that are shared by all isolates
included in our study, representing virulent as well as
avirulent isolates, it is not very likely the core genome
alone is sufficient for virulence. This is confirmed by the
finding of several genes putatively involved in virulence
in the RD regions of P1/7 that probably attribute to
virulence or survival in the host of P1/7. However, since
all isolates, including avirulent ones like T15, 12 and 16
[13,21], can colonize porcine tonsils, the core genome
might be sufficient for colonization.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we show that CGH is a valuable method.
Not only can it be used for genotyping of S. suis isolates,
but CGH also gives information on phylogeny of isolates, and can be used to look for specific gene content,
like virulence genes, or sequence variation among isolates. At present a disadvantage of CGH using the current microarray is the one way character of the
technology; only distribution of genes present in P1/7
can be studied using the current microarray. Recently,
several S. suis isolates have been sequenced adding new
information to the S. suis pangenome. The Chinese
human isolates were shown to contain an additional
putative pathogenicity island (PI) of 89 kb compared to
P1/7 [41], whereas the Vietnamese strain BM407 contained another additional PI compared to P1/7 [7]. Both
PI’s were shown to contain integrative and conjugative
elements (ICE) not present in P1/7. The current microarray will have to be extended with genome sequences
of other S. suis isolates to be a better representation of
the S. suis pangenome.
