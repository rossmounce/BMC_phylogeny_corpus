Abstract
Background: The mechanisms that shape the host plant range of herbivorous insect are to date
not well understood but knowledge of these mechanisms and the selective forces that influence
them can expand our understanding of the larger ecological interaction. Nevertheless, it is well
established that chemical defenses of plants influence the host range of herbivorous insects. While
host plant chemistry is influenced by phylogeny, also the growth forms of plants appear to influence
the plant defense strategies as first postulated by Feeny (the "plant apparency" hypothesis). In the
present study we aim to investigate the molecular basis of the diverse host plant range of the
comma butterfly (Polygonia c-album) by testing differential gene expression in the caterpillars on
three host plants that are either closely related or share the same growth form.
Results: In total 120 genes were identified to be differentially expressed in P. c-album after feeding
on different host plants, 55 of them in the midgut and 65 in the restbody of the caterpillars.
Expression patterns could be confirmed with an independent method for 14 of 27 tested genes.
Pairwise similarities in upregulation in the midgut of the caterpillars were higher between plants
that shared either growth form or were phylogenetically related. No known detoxifying enzymes
were found to be differently regulated in the midgut after feeding on different host plants.
Conclusion: Our data suggest a complex picture of gene expression in response to host plant
feeding. While each plant requires a unique gene regulation in the caterpillar, both phylogenetic
relatedness and host plant growth form appear to influence the expression profile of the
polyphagous comma butterfly, in agreement with phylogenetic studies of host plant utilization in
butterflies.

Background
Chemical defenses of plants influence the host range of
herbivorous insects [1-4]. Although by no means the only
factor involved in shaping insect-host associations [5],

few researchers would argue against its general importance. However, there is an ongoing argument over the
reasons for similarities among plant defense chemicals.
There are two ways for evolution to achieve similarity:

either through shared ancestry or through evolutionary
convergence (or parallelism). Ehrlich and Raven [2] suggested that related insects tend to feed on related plants,
and several other studies have continued to demonstrate
a role of host plant phylogeny (shared ancestry) on patterns of host plant use [6-14]. Hence, there is strong support for a historical component in patterns of host plant
use.
On the other hand, several authors have also pointed out
that plant chemistry does not always follow phylogeny
[10,15,16]. Feeny [17] suggested that plant defense strategies should differ depending on their "apparency"; plants
that are long-lived and/or physically large will always be
found by attacking insects and should possess constitutive
chemical defenses such as tannins, terpenes, and flavanoids (see also [18-21]) that have a quantitative, dosage-dependent effect. Unapparent plants, with lower risk
of detection by herbivores, should instead tend to utilize
induced chemical defenses. Trees should be the most
apparent of plants as they are both physically large and
long-lived. According to the apparency hypothesis, trees
should then tend to have more convergent constitutive
defenses than herbs, and as a consequence we should see
more host shifts involving trees than herbs. Despite some
criticism and uncertainty regarding the mechanisms
involved, the apparency theory has remained a useful
framework for thinking about the evolution of plant
chemical defense in the context of plant community heterogeneity [22].
In a phylogenetic reanalysis of Ehrlich and Raven's [2]
study on butterfly and plant coevolution, Janz & Nylin [9]
found strong effects of both plant phylogeny and growth
form on patterns of host use among butterflies. An overwhelming majority of host shifts occurred while feeding
on trees, giving support for Feeny's "plant apparency"
hypothesis. Trees appeared to serve as a "bridge" that
could facilitate host shifts between distantly related
plants.
Hence, there is support for both shared ancestry and convergent evolution in the large-scale chemical structuring
of insect-host associations, but the mechanistic basis
remains largely unknown. However, recent years have
seen great progress in understanding of the molecular
mechanisms that enable insect to feed on certain host
plants. In general it is assumed that insects apply phase I
and phase II detoxifying enzymes to metabolize secondary plant compounds. Several studies have for example
revealed the important role of the cytochrome P450
enzyme family for detoxification of plant secondary compounds as well as insecticides. [23-27]. Glutathione-Stransferases (GSTs) have also been shown to be induced
in generalist and specialist lepidopteran larvae upon feed-

ing on their host plants [28,29]. Wittstock et al. [30] identified the Nitrile-specifier Protein (NSP) in Pieris rapae.
NSP redirects the glucosinolate hydrolysis and by that
enables the Pierinae butterflies to feed on the plant family
Brassicaceae. Further research has been done on the evolution of NSP showing its evolution by domain and gene
duplication from a gene of unknown function that is
widespread in insect species [31,32]. Plutella xylostella is
also feeding on glucosinolate containing plants. Here the
Glucosinolate sulfatase (GSS) inhibits the hydrolysis of
glucosinolates completely by forming a desulfo-glucosinolate. In spite of progress in recent years, much is still to
be discovered in the detoxification mechanisms of insects.
In the present study we aim to investigate the molecular
basis of the diverse host plant range of the comma butterfly (Polygonia c-album, Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae). P. calbum is a widespread polyphagous butterfly species of the
family Nymphalidae. It is found all over Eurasia, from
England to Japan and from the central of Sweden to the
northern tip of Africa. The larvae can be found on host
plants from several taxa: the "urticalean rosids" Urtica,
Humulus and Ulmus and the distantly related Salix (Salicaceae), Ribes (Grossulariaceae), Betula and Corylus (Betulaceae) [33]; hence the species is at the extreme end of
polyphagy among butterflies, although by no means an
indiscriminate generalist [9].
For this study, we used a test array with three host plants
of P. c-album that are either closely related (Stinging nettle
Urtica dioica and Wych Elm Ulmus glabra - both in Urticales) or share the same growth form (Great Sallow Salix
caprea and Ulmus glabra - both trees). Following Feeny's
"plant apparency" hypothesis and the phylogenetic patterns of host shifts found by Janz & Nylin [9] and Janz et
al. [8], we expected to find more similarities in the gene
expression profiles of caterpillars that have been feeding
on plants that either have a shared ancestry (U. dioica and
U. glabra) or belong to the same growth form (S. caprea
and U. glabra).

Results
General patterns of gene expression
The pattern of expression in the midgut corresponded to
the formed predictions that more similarities will be
found in the gene expression profiles of caterpillars that
have been feeding on plants that either have a shared
ancestry (U. dioica and U. glabra) or belong to the same
growth form (S. caprea and U. glabra) (Additional File 1;
Table S1, Figure 1). There were significantly more
uniquely upregulated genes in the larval midgut on the
Urtica and Salix diets than on the Ulmus diet (likelihoodratio χ2 test, observed frequencies (Urtica, Salix, Ulmus) =
22, 16, 6 (expected frequencies equal), χ2 = 9.8990, p =
0.007). Pairwise similarities in upregulation were higher

Function and patterns of differentially expressed genes
In total we identified 120 differentially expressed genes,
55 in the midgut of P. c-album and 65 in the restbody
(Additional File 1; Table S1 and Table S2). In the midgut
six sequences gave no hit and in the restbody 2 sequences
gave no hit in BLAST searches. Many of the differentially
expressed genes in the midgut are likely to be involved in

metabolism and digestion, ranging from protein degradation to starch and lipid breakdown for nutrient acquisition. We could also identify eight ribosomal genes and
seven genes that are involved in translation regulation and
the DNA structure in the cell nucleus. Furthermore, we
found three genes involved in immunity and one transmembrane transport domain. There were also differentially expressed proteases, but we did not identify any
differentially expressed known detoxifying enzymes in the
midgut. Four of the differentially expressed genes were
unknown (Additional File 1; Table S1).
In the restbody of the comma butterfly larvae again, the
majority of the gene products are most likely involved in
the metabolism of the caterpillar or translate into ribosomal proteins. Seven of the sequenced gene fragments
appear to have a structural role, and are mostly involved
in chitin binding. We could also identify translation regulation genes and some involved in cellular architecture
(Additional File 1; Table S2). One sequence showed moderate similarities (e-value of 0,00000008) to potential
detoxification genes, namely a cytochrome P450 of
Plutella xylostella (Additional File 1; Table S2).
Confirmation of differentially expressed genes
Of the total 122 genes originating from GeneFishing, we
picked 27 genes (18 from midguts and 9 from restbodies)
to confirm differential gene expression pattern with qRTPCR. We were able to see identical expression patterns in
the GeneFishing and in the qRT-PCR results for 14 of the
27 genes (10 in midguts and 4 in restbodies). Partial similarity (same in relation to one diet) in expression patterns
between two independent methods could be observed in
7 genes (4 in midguts and 3 in restbodies) and 5 genes (4
in midguts and 1 in restbodies) behaved differently (Additional File 1; Table S3).

In the midgut, genes that showed similar expression patterns as in the GeneFishing experiment included proteins
involved in digestion, namely chymotrypsinogen-like
protein 3, serine protease, chymotrypsin-like protease,
alpha-amylase, trypsin-like protease, trypsin Ia precursor,
long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase and short-chain dehydrogenease/reductase 2. In addition, also a ribosomal protein
S16 and the immune response related protein cobatoxin
showed same expression patterns in the qRT-PCR and in
the differential gene expression study. In the restbodies
alpha-amylase and the serine protease precursor were similarly expressed. The stress related heat shock cognate 70
protein and a potential cytochrome P450 also showed
similar expression pattern in both methods.

Discussion
Our expression data suggest a complex interaction
between the comma butterfly and its host plants. On the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/506

one hand, each plant species appears to require a very specific subset of genes to be regulated in the midgut upon
feeding. This involves digestion proteins, immunity
related genes, general metabolism genes and ribosomal
protein as well as translational and transport genes. In the
restbody we also find cell signaling related domains, hormone synthesis genes and genes involved in silk production, suggesting a gene regulation, tuned specifically for
each plant species. On the other hand, counting of upregulation of genes in the midgut shows a suggestive pattern
(Figure 1). Both species of the Urticales family (Ulmus and
Urtica), as well as both trees, have a higher agreement of
gene regulation than do the stinging nettle and the great
sallow. Especially the digestion and ribosomal genes
show clear differences here (Additional File 1; Table S1).
This suggests that phylogenetic and/or growth form relatedness demand more similar expression profiles in the
midgut of the caterpillars.
However, this pattern only holds true for the midgut of
the comma butterfly; the restbody of the caterpillars show
a completely different picture. Here the stinging nettle and
great sallow diet in contrast share the highest similarity in
gene expression, while the wych elm appears to require
less gene upregulation in general (Additional File 1; Table
S2, Figure 2). The midgut is the place of contact with the
food bolus, and the location where the first detoxifying
and digestive actions will take place, whereas the restbody
is only indirectly involved in this process by receiving the
solubilized products and only sometimes toxic or toxin
degradation products. Here the actual nutrient content is
of more importance. This might explain the converse picture we observe in those two tissues. While the defense
compounds of the phylogenetically or growth formrelated plants might be more similar, our data suggests
that the nutritional value does not follow this line.
Previous data on larval performance show that caterpillars
of P. c-album perform differently on the plant species used
in this study, suggesting different levels of adaptation
and/or different nutritional values (e.g. [34]). The general
pattern is that the plants in Urticales (U. dioica and U. glabra) support the highest growth rates, while larvae grow
slower on S. caprea (but pupal weights are typically
larger). These differences are also reflected in the preference hierarchy of the ovipositing females, which means
that the preference-performance correlation is good on a
population level [33,34] (Figure 3).
Oviposition preference and larval performance on U. glabra are more variable between years than the other plants,
so that in some years it is considerably less preferred than
U. dioica, with a correspondingly lower performance
(Nylin, S. and Janz, N., unpublished data). This could be
caused by higher between-year variability in U. glabra

the restbody of P. c-album larvae. Cytochrome P450's are
also involved in the metabolism of many endogenous
compounds, hence this P450 expressed in the restbody is
possibly not involved in the detoxification of plant
defense compounds, but in metabolism.

compared to the other two hosts. Such unpredictable variation would make it more difficult to adapt to the host.
Indeed, the lower amount of uniquely upregulated genes
on Ulmus found in this study would suggest such insufficient adaptation to this host.
In the midgut we could not detect any differentially
expressed known detoxifying genes, such as cytochromes
P450s or glutathione-S-transferases (GST). However,
those enzymes are with high probability active in the gut
of the comma butterfly larvae when encountering plant
material. The GeneFishing method identifies solely differentially expressed genes. Hence, P. c-album might very
well express such Phase I and Phase II detoxifying genes,
but in a constant manner independent of the diet. Being a
highly polyphagous insect species, the comma butterfly
might be endued with very broad acting detoxifying
enzymes that can cope with a wide variety of the compounds and hence are expressed continuously when feeding independent of the diet. The lack of differentially
expressed detoxifying enzymes could also be due to overlaps of toxic chemistry on the three host plants.
With the exception of cytochrome P450s and GSTs not
much is known about detoxifying enzymes applied by
generalist insects. Hence such expressed enzymes could
not be identified in databases. In the midgut we identified
4 unknown differentially expressed genes, which could
very well be unknown genes involved in detoxification.
We could, however, identify a differentially expressed
gene homologous to a cytochrome P450 of P. xylostella in

While the detoxifying mechanisms appear not to be differentially expressed we see genes belonging to other classes
differentially expressed. Short-chain dehydrogenases
(SCDH) for example are upregulated in the midguts of on
Urtica and Ulmus feeding larvae. SCDH form a large protein family with highly different enzymes, which only
share 15-30% identity among each other [35]. They are
present in all the life forms studied so far, have a very wide
substrate spectrum and are generally involved in cellular
differentiation and signaling [36].
Not surprisingly, also many digestive enzymes are differentially expressed in the midgut (Additional File 1; Table
S1). For example an alpha-amylase was down-regulated in
both tree diets in comparison to the stinging nettle. Amylases are enzymes participating in carbohydrate digestion.
It is known that insects possess different amylases for
starches [37]. It is possible that the differential expression
we observe is due to different starch contents in the stinging nettle. We also found several serine proteases being
differentially expressed upon feeding on the host plants,
namely trypsins and chymotrypsins. Plants possess proteinase inhibitors (PIs), which are insect inducible peptidases that can suppress insect proteinases and by that
reduce the digestibility [38,39]. It has been shown that
lepidopteran larvae adapt their proteinases expression
profile to the PI content of their food plant, upregulating
proteinases that are insensitive to the plant PIs [37]. Our
expression patterns suggest different proteinase requirements for the three host plants. We also excised four
bands that were identified as homologous to Bmlipase-1;
three of them were highly expressed in larvae feeding on
Urtica and one on Salix. Insect midgut lipases have been
studied in few insects so far and little to nothing is known
on different expression of lipases in insects [37]. They
form in insects a gene family that underwent many duplication events [40] with resulting diverse and overlapping
function. Bmlipase-1 from Bombyx mori shows a high antiviral activity against Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus,
although it is not inducible by viral infection. Its main
function is probably as a digestive enzyme, as it is exclusively expressed in the gut tissue and has lipase activity
[41].
We also found many ribosomal proteins to be differentially regulated upon feeding on different host plants,
namely seven in the midgut and twelve in the restbody of
P. c-album. Ribosomal genes are considered to be stably
expressed and have been suggested and used as house-

keeping genes in expression analysis. However, there are a
number of ribosomal proteins that have been found to be
differentially expressed upon different treatment and in
different tissues [42], suggesting that there are major differences in expression patterns between different ribosomal proteins.
The complex pattern found in this study should perhaps
not be surprising, considering that secondary metabolites,
leaf texture and nutrient contents vary greatly between different plant species, and also depending on the plant age
[43]. The three chosen P. c-album host plants have different leaf architecture, with the stinging nettle possessing
thin hairy leaves, and both trees waxy leaves, that differ in
shape. Besides the prominent stinging trichomes that only
provide an effective defense against vertebrate herbivores
[44], stinging nettle leaves also contain the phenolic compound caffeic acid, tannins, nicotine in measurable
amounts and flavonoid glucosides [45,46]. Salix leaves
has low levels of toxins but more condensed tannins [47],
which is similar to the situation in elm [45,46].
Phenolic compounds, nicotine, tannins and flavonoids
have been shown to affect insects feeding on them. Tannins for example are astringent, bitter plant polyphenols
that either bind and precipitate or shrink proteins. Studies
on the effect of tannins on the gut pH and redox potential
of larvae found that many specialist and generalist insects
have developed adaptations to cope with them [48,49].
Tannin metabolites are for example oxidized during the
gut passage in the aquatic caterpillar Acentria ephemerella.
Resistance against polyphenols appears to be correlated in
general with better repair mechanisms in the gut tissue
that enables to cope with free radical stress occurring during oxidation better [50]. Nicotine acts as agonist of the
postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors of the insect
central nervous system. Metabolism of nicotine has been
attributed to the action of cytochrome P450 [51,52]. Flavonoids in contrast can be sequestered from the diet and
used for protection and pigmentation. In B. mori for
example three flavonoid glycosides could be isolated from
the cocoon shell [53]. The role of these secondary plant
compounds in the interaction between P. c-album and its
host plant and the adaptations P. c-album developed to
them however, is not known.
Different plants also possess different microfloras [54],
which affect immune response-related gene expression in
the midgut of lepidopteran larvae [55]. We detected cobatoxin and gloverin homologous genes that are known to
be inducible by bacterial challenge to be differentially
expressed in the midgut tissue [56-58]. We see gloverin
expression only in Urtica fed larvae and cobatoxin in Salix
fed larvae, suggesting different microbial environments
on those two species. In addition to differences in plant
secondary metabolites P c.-album must therefore also face

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/506

different bacterial quantities and qualities on its various
host plants.

Conclusion
Our data suggest a complex picture of gene expression in
response to host plants, but also revealed some general
patterns. While each plant evidently requires a unique
gene regulation in the caterpillar, both phylogenetic relatedness and host plant growth form appear to influence
the expression profile of the polyphagous comma butterfly, in agreement with phylogenetic studies of host plant
utilization in butterflies.

Methods
Larval rearing and preparation
Stock used in the experiments was the offspring of four
female comma butterflies collected in early May 2007 in
the near-Stockholm area of Sweden. The females had
already mated in the wild with unknown males and were
put into cages for oviposition. Each female was presented
with the host plants stinging nettle (U. dioica) and Great
Sallow (S. caprea). Eggs were counted in the beginning of
each day and were incubated in small jars on a sun-lit windowsill until hatching.

Larvae of each female were evenly spread across the three
host plants. They were raised on stinging nettle, great sallow or elm (U. glabra) in individual jars. Plant material
was cut from mature foliage of naturally growing plants
and placed in water culture. The jars were placed in a climate room (temperature 20°C, LD 12:12) where larvae
were raised to the 4th instar before dissection of the midgut. Plants were changed when needed due to withering or
feeding. To maintain humidity, water was sprayed over
the jars twice a day. Jars were changed randomly to avoid
position effects. Between 10 and 43 individuals from each
family were dissected, for a total of 109 individuals across
the three different diets. Midguts and the rest of the larval
body were preserved separately in RNA later® (Ambion).
RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription
Larvae were dissected, and the midguts and restbodies
were stored in RNA later® (Ambion). Tissue samples were
pooled (10-13 individuals) according to the larval diet
(Salix, Urtica, Ulmus). The guts were homogenized by an
Ultra-Turrax homogenizer (Beckman Coulter Scientific)
in TRIzol (Invitrogen) reagent and restbodies were
crushed in liquid nitrogen. For all samples TRIzol Reagent
was used to isolate the RNA according to the manufacturer's protocol with the following modifications. After
adding chloroform to separate the phases, the tubes were
stored for 15 minutes at 4°C before centrifugation. To
precipitate the RNA the solution was stored at -20°C overnight. After precipitation the RNA solution was centrifuged for 30 min at 4°C. The obtained dried pellet was
dissolved in 90 μl RNA storage solution (Ambion), and

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:506

any remaining genomic DNA contamination was
removed by DNAse treatment (TURBO DNAse, Ambion).
The DNAse enzyme was removed and the RNA was further purified by using the RNeasy MinElute Clean up Kit
(Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocol and
eluted in 20 μl of RNA storage solution (Ambion).
Differential gene expression
The GeneFishing (SeeGene) DEG Premix Kit essentially
allows the amplification of the same set of genes from different samples due to a 10-mer core of arbitrary annealing
control primers. By not exceeding the exponential phase
of the PCR amplification, differentially expressed genes
can be identified on an agarose gel.

To study differential gene expression between P. c-album
larvae grown on different plants (U. glabra, S. caprea and
U. dioica) the DEG GeneFishing Kit was used, following
the manufacturer's protocol. In short 3 μg of DNA-free
total RNA was converted into single-stranded cDNA using
annealing control primer one (dTACP1) and a mixture of
different reverse transcriptases (Array Script, Ambion;
Power Script, Clontech; Bioscript, Bioline). Second-strand
cDNA synthesis and subsequent PCRs were performed
essentially as described in the DEG GeneFishing protocol.
PCR products were separated and visualized on a 2% agarose gel. Differentially expressed bands were cut out from
the agarose gels and PCR products extracted using Zymoclean Gel DNA Recovery Kit™ (Zymo Research) according
to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA fragments were
cloned into the pCR II TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Eight
clones were picked for each extracted band and further
processed.
DNA Sequencing and Analysis
Plasmid minipreparations from bacterial colonies grown
in 96 deep-well plates were performed using the 96 robot
plasmid isolation kit (Eppendorf) on a Tecan Evo Freedom 150 robotic platform (Tecan). Single-pass sequencing of the 5' and 3' termini of individual clones was
carried out on an ABI 3730 xl automatic DNA sequencer
(PE Applied Biosystems).

Vector clipping, quality trimming and sequence assembly
was done with the Lasergene software package (DNAStar
Inc.). BLAST searches were conducted on a local server
using the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) blastall program and best hits were recorded.
Identified sequences of this study were submitted to Genbank and can be found under Accession numbers

expressed sequences clustered in the assembly in the same
contig, it was assumed to be a recent duplication.

Quantitative real-time PCR
500 ng of DNA-free total RNA was converted into singlestranded DNA using a mix of random and oligo-dT20
primers according to the ABgene protocol (ABgene). Realtime PCR oligonucleotide primers were designed using
the online Primer3 internet based interface http://
frodo.wi.mit.edu. Primers were designed by the rules of
highest maximum efficiency and sensitivity rules were followed to avoid formation of self and hetero-dimers, hairpins and self-complementarity. Gene-specific primers
were designed on the basis of sequences obtained for
selected P. c-album genes and two additional genes as
potential housekeeping genes (ribosomal protein subunit
18S and elongation initiation factor 4) to serve as the
endogenous control (normalizer) [see Additional file 2].

Both house-keeping primers were thoroughly tested. RPS
18 was the most consistent gene, and this was then used
for the further analysis. QRT-PCR was done in optical 96well plates on a MX3000P Real-Time PCR Detection System (Stratagene) using the Absolute QPCR SYBR green
Mix (ABgene) to monitor double-stranded DNA synthesis
in combination with ROX as a passive reference dye
included in the PCR master mix.
Scoring of expression similarities
Similarities in gene regulation were scored by counting
upregulation (+/++) versus no expression (-). A semiquantitative measure of upregulation was obtained by visually differentiating between strong (++) and weak (+)
bands. The number of genes that were uniquely upregulated in any of the three plants, and the number of genes
that were similarly upregulated in a pair of plants were
then compared and analyzed with χ2 goodness-of-fit tests
(Figure 1 and 2).
