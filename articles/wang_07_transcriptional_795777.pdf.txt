Abstract
Background: Human eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (edn) and eosinophil cationic protein (ecp)
are members of a subfamily of primate ribonuclease (rnase) genes. Although they are generated by
gene duplication event, distinct edn and ecp expression profile in various tissues have been
reported.
Results: In this study, we obtained the upstream promoter sequences of several representative
primate eosinophil rnases. Bioinformatic analysis revealed the presence of a shared 34-nucleotide
(nt) sequence stretch located at -81 to -48 in all edn promoters and macaque ecp promoter. Such
a unique sequence motif constituted a region essential for transactivation of human edn in
hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay, transient transfection and
scanning mutagenesis experiments allowed us to identify binding sites for two transcription factors,
Myc-associated zinc finger protein (MAZ) and SV-40 protein-1 (Sp1), within the 34-nt segment.
Subsequent in vitro and in vivo binding assays demonstrated a direct molecular interaction between
this 34-nt region and MAZ and Sp1. Interestingly, overexpression of MAZ and Sp1 respectively
repressed and enhanced edn promoter activity. The regulatory transactivation motif was mapped
to the evolutionarily conserved -74/-65 region of the edn promoter, which was guanidine-rich and
critical for recognition by both transcription factors.
Conclusion: Our results provide the first direct evidence that MAZ and Sp1 play important roles
on the transcriptional activation of the human edn promoter through specific binding to a 34-nt
segment present in representative primate eosinophil rnase promoters.

Background
Human edn and ecp respectively encode eosinophilderived neurotoxin (EDN) and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), two of the four major proteins found in granules of human eosinophilic leukocytes. Their gene
products belong to members of the human RNaseA superfamily, which comprises RNase1-13 [1-6]. The eosinophil
RNases EDN and ECP are secreted to body fluid and have
neurotoxic, helminthotoxic, and ribonucleolytic activities. Previously, we demonstrated that ECP enters neuroendocrine cells through protein-protein interactions
with a granular protease, which in turn allows the cytotoxic ECP to inhibit growth of the target cells [7]. In addition, the signal peptide of ECP is toxic to bacteria and
yeast and induces expression of transforming growth factor α in human cells [8,9]. Although both genes are
expressed in eosinophils, edn, rather than ecp, can be
extensively expressed in various tissues including liver,
spleen, and kidney [10-12], whereas ecp is restrictively
expressed in blood granulocytes. In terms of gene structure, edn and ecp are similar as they both contain an intron
between a noncoding exon 1 and a coding exon 2. Each of
these genes is translated from exon 2, and the sequence
identity of the DNA in the coding region is 85% [13]. It
has been proposed that edn and ecp were evolved through
a duplication event about 31 million years ago in the evolutionary lineage of New World and Old World monkeys
[14]. Gene duplication and subsequent functional divergence of duplicated genes is one of the important mechanisms for evolution of novel gene functions [15-18].
However, the regulatory motifs in promoter regions of
duplicated genes are generally conserved during duplication events [19-21].
Previously, three important transcription factor binding
sites, C/EBP, NFAT-1 and PU.1 were discovered in the promoter regions of both edn and ecp, and the non-translating
exon 1 as well as intron 1 could enhance the promoter
activities [22-26]. Although as high as 92% sequence
identity was observed in the upstream 1-kb regions of
human edn and ecp, much higher edn promoter activity
was observed. Therefore, whether any sequence stretch
located in the upstream regions of primate eosinophil
rnases may govern regulatory transcription of ecp and edn
was investigated employing cross-species sequence comparison, transcription element prediction and functional
validation.

Result
Primate edn and ecp promoters share high sequence
similarity
We amplified and sequenced primate eosinophil rnase
promoter fragments, -921 to -1 [22] and -937 to -1 relative
to the human edn and ecp transcription start site, respectively [27], from individual of six nonhuman primate spe-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/89

cies. These primate species represent independent genera
from three great apes (P. pygmaeus, G. gorilla, P. troglodytes), one Old World monkey (M. fascicularis), and one
New World monkey (S. sciureus). The sequence data have
been submitted to GenBank (GenBank accession numbers DQ171721–DQ171729). Multiple sequence alignment by ClustalW showed that the identities among
primate edn and ecp promoter sets were greater than 95%
and 91%, respectively. In consistence with what Zhang
and Rosenberg have characterized, the sequences of the 5'
promoter regions of P. troglodytes (chimpanzee) edn and
ecp determined in this study were identical to those
reported in AF294016-AF294018 and AF294027-294028,
respectively [18].
Comparative analysis reveals deletion of a 34-nt segment
in the ecp promoter
Conventional multiple sequence alignment of primate
edn and ecp promoters revealed greater than 90% identity
in the duplicated eosinophil rnases in each species, indicating that the promoter sequence patterns of all
sequenced primate eosinophil rnases were quite similar.
Interestingly, MISA analysis of 11 promoters showed a
remarkably high degree of similarity as illustrated by the
color-coded bars, and a 34-nt segment with significantly
high variation was located at -81 to -48 as indicated by
dotted grey grids (Fig. 1A). This characteristic sequence
motif was present in promoters of all representative primate edns, but for ecp only in macaque. Since primate
eosinophil rnases have been recognized to be emerged
from a gene duplication event after divergence of Old
World monkeys and New World monkeys, this finding
suggests the possibility that the eosinophil rnase promoters might have further evolved after the duplication event.

Subsequently, we were able to distinguish within the 34nt region two conserved sequence motifs "74ACCCTCCCTC-65" and "-62GGCTCTGCTGGCCCA-48"
(Fig. 1B). The Furthermore, primate eosinophil rnase promoter sequences corresponding to -921 to -1 of human
edn and -887 to -1 of human ecp were analyzed by MEGA
3.1, and the phylogenetic relationship between ecp and
edn promoter sequences among different species is was
illustrated in Figure 1C. The results showed that the ecp
and edn promoters branched when the 34-nt segment disappeared in some species, in agreement with the notion
that ecp and edn were the most rapidly evolving coding
sequences of primate genes [4]. The phylogenetic tree of
ecp and edn promoter sequences suggested another evolutional event by which deletion of the 34-nt sequence
stretch might have occurred in the lineage Old Word monkey and hominoid.

Presence of the 34-nt segment enhances transcriptional
activities
Expression of human edn is dependent on the interaction
between an intronic enhancer element(s) and the 5' promoter region [27]. The transcription activities of human
edn and ecp promoters in hematopoietic cell lines were
previously reported [24]. In addition, edn was demonstrated not only expressed in thymus but also in liver tissue [28], and its mRNA expression has been identified in
hematopoietic cell line and liver tissue [11]. As shown in
Fig. 2A, both edn and ecp mRNAs were expressed in HL-60
clone 15 cells, but only edn mRNA was detected in HepG2
cells. Therefore, HepG2 cell line was used for further
investigation of differential transcription regulation of edn
and ecp. In order to understand the sequences involved in
the interaction, we constructed individually the +1 to
+297 region containing exon 1 and intron 1 of ecp and edn
promoters, along with the preceding promoter region into
the pGL3-Basic plasmid. Here a liver cell line HepG2,
known to express edn (epx) effectively [3,11] was used to
investigate the transcriptional activities of human edn and
ecp promoters in the presence and absence of the 34-nt
segment. As shown in Figure 2B, HepG2 cells transfected
with constructs containing human edn with the -81/-48
segment deleted (pGL3-edn∆(-81/-48)), human ecp
(pGL3-ecp), human ecp with the 34-nt region inserted
(pGL3-ecp+(-81/-48)) exhibited only 40%, 20% and 40%
transcriptional activity, respectively, relative to that of
human edn (pGL3-edn), indicating that presence of the
34-nt segment enhanced transcriptional activity of edn
and ecp promoters. Removal of the 34-nt region from the
edn promoter led to a 60% reduction in transcriptional
activity, suggesting that the 34-nt segment was critical for
transcription of edn. Interestingly, when the 34-nt segment was artificially inserted into the ecp promoter in the
region corresponding to its position in edn, the transcriptional activity of ecp increased two fold. Our results demonstrated that the presence of the 34-nt segment
correlated with enhanced transcriptional activity of ecp in
HepG2 cells. Similarly, the 34-nt segment also enhanced
the edn and ecp promoter activities in HL-60 clone 15
cells; cell of hematopoietic origin known to have transcriptional activities of human edn and ecp promoters
[24]. (Supplementary Fig. 1). Thus, we postulated that a
novel regulatory motif(s) residing in the promoter region
of primate edn, especially those in the 34-nt segment,
played an important role in regulating transactivation in
liver and hematopoietic cells. Furthermore, the edn promoter activity dramatically reduced in response to the
ablation of intron-based enhancer element no matter in
the presence or absence of the 34-nt segment (unpublished data), indicating that the regulatory effect of the
intronic enhancer was not correlated to the unique 34-nt
segment.

Multiple sequence alignment of the 34-nt segment in all
primate edn and macaque ecp, revealed the existence of
two
well
conserved
sequence
stretches,
"74ACCCTCCCTC-65" and "-62GGCTCTGCTGGCCCA-48".
The combination of ConSite [29] and TESS (Transcription
Element Search System) [30] suggested several putative
transcription factor binding sites, including Sp1, MAZ,
activator protein-2 (AP2) and liver factor A1 (LF-A1)
located at (-73/-65), (-73/-67), (-68/-60) and (-69/-55),
respectively. As shown in Figure 2C, the transcription
activities of reporters containing mutant -74 to -65 region
and mutant region -62 to -48 were similar to that of
human edn with the 34-nt segment deleted, indicating
that each of the two conserved regions, -74/-65 and -62/48, contribute to the regulation of edn transcription.
Transcription elements for MAZ and Sp1 binding are
present in the 34-nt segment
To elucidate whether the 34-nt region might play an
important role in edn expression by serving as a recognition site for transcription factors, EMSA was performed to
demonstrate binding between the 34-nt segment and
nuclear proteins in vitro. Binding reactions between double-stranded probes derived from the human edn promoter sequence and HepG2 nuclear extracts produced
one major shifted band and a less prominent shifted
product (Fig. 3A, lane 1). Both shifted signals diminished
with the addition of excess unlabeled 34-nt oligonucleotide (Fig. 3A, lane 2), suggesting that specific proteinDNA complexes are formed within this 34-nt region.
Interestingly, mutant -74/-65 or mutant -62/-48 oligonucleotide did not compete with the major complex (Fig. 3A,
lanes 3 and 4); however, the mutant -62/-48 oligonucleotide, but not mutant -74/-65, significantly competed
with the minor band shift. Taken together, these results
suggest that regions -62/-48 and -74/-65 serve as binding
sites for transcription factors in HepG2 cells.

ConSite and TESS predictions revealed that transcription
factors AP2, MAZ, Sp1, and LF-A1 might bind to the 34-nt
segment. In addition, since hepatocyte nuclear factor-4
(HNF-4) was reported to be identical to LF-A1 [31], an
HNF-4 consensus sequence was also used to compete wild
type binding along with the consensus oligonucleotides
representing the other four transcription factor binding
motifs. The results showed that the formation of the
major band shift was completely abolished only by the
MAZ consensus oligonucleotide (Fig. 3B, lane 4), but not
consensus Sp1, LF-A1, HNF-4, and AP2 oligonucleotides,
with serum responsive element (SRE) and c-myb oligonucleotides were used as negative controls. However, the formation of the minor shift was diminished by MAZ and
Sp1 consensus oligonucleotides (Fig. 3C, lanes 2 and 4).
Furthermore, when the mutant MAZ (mMAZ) oligonucleotide containing GA box mutation was used as an unla-

five independent experiments. The difference between the two groups is statistically significant (P < 0.05), as determined by the
Wilcoxon Rank Sum test.

beled competitor, it did not compete with the major band
shift (Fig. 3C, lane 3). Likewise, mutant Sp1 competitor
(mSp1) containing GC box mutation was unable to compete with the minor band shift ether (Fig. 3C, lane 5).
These EMSA competition experiments clearly demonstrate that the transcription factors MAZ and Sp1 are
involved in formation of protein-DNA complex in the 34nt sequence stretch.
MAZ binds to the 34-nt segment in vitro
To confirm specific binding between MAZ and the wild
type 34-nt segment, we conducted EMSA with nuclear
extracts of HepG2 cells or recombinant MAZ in the presence of an antibody against MAZ (anti-MAZ). When 32Plabeled 34-nt oligonucleotide probe was reacted with
HepG2 cell nuclear extract in the presence of anti-MAZ,
no supershift representing the anti-MAZ-MAZ-DNA complex was observed, but there was a marked reduction in
the major radiolabeled protein-DNA complex (Fig. 4A,
lane 3), possibly due to the nature of anti-MAZ, which
may recognize MAZ precisely at the DNA-binding
domain. The third and fourth zinc fingers of MAZ are
essential for its DNA binding activity [32]. We next used
purified recombinant GST-MAZ and GST-MAZ∆F34, a

mutant MAZ lacking the third and fourth zinc fingers
indispensable for its DNA binding activity in EMSA experiment. As expected, the presence of an increased amount
of the former led to elevated DNA binding activity (Fig.
4B, lanes 1 to 4, upper panel), but that of the latter did not
recognize the 34-nt segment at all (Fig. 4B, lanes 5 to 8,
upper panel). Taken together, these results indicate that
MAZ may specifically recognize and bind to the 34-nt segment derived from the edn promoter.
The -73/-67 and -62/-52 regions in the 34-nt segment are
important for MAZ binding
To map the exact MAZ-binding motif located the 34-nt
segment, mutagenesis scanning was performed employing 21 probes covering serial tri- or di-nucleotide mutations as listed in supplementary Table 2. Unlabeled 200fold molar excess wild type 34-nt oligonucleotide could
abolish the specific shift of the MAZ complex (Fig. 5A,
lane 2). Results in Fig. 5A indicated that no significant
competition occurred when the m1, m2 and m3 competitors were used, suggesting that an essential MAZ binding
site existed in the -74 to -66 region, most likely at the
CCCTCCC motif that is equivalent to a known transcription element GA box [33]. However, m4, m5, m6, m7 and

m8 oligonucleotides effectively competed for binding.
Interestingly, the extent of competition by unlabeled m9,
m11, m12, m14, m18 and m19 oligonucleotides seemed
partial, and none by m10, m13, m15, m16 and m17 oligonucleotides. A brief summary of the mutagenesis scanning result is shown in Figure 5B. These data provide the
first direct evidence that in human edn promoter, other
than a conventional GA box located in a conserved -73/66 region, there is a novel transcription regulatory motif
in the conserved -62/-52 region.
In this study, we examined further in vitro MAZ binding
to the 34-nt segment employing DAPA with anti-SAF-1
against a rabbit zinc finger protein serum amyloid A activating factor-1 (SAF-1) homologous to human MAZ [34].
We observed an enhanced MAZ signal was observed in the
cells transfected with pcDNA3/MAZ (Fig. 5C), which indicated that rabbit anti-SAF-1 could be used to detect
human MAZ in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, DAPA revealed
that MAZ bound to the wild type 34-nt segment attached
to the bead. However, the binding activity diminished
when either the -74/-65 or -62/-48 region was mutated

(Fig. 5D). These results were consistent with that of the
EMSA scanning mutagenesis in which either the -74/-65
or -62/-48 mutation of the 34-nt segment led to decreased
MAZ binding activity.
Transcription factor Sp1 also binds to the 34-nt segment
Our examination using TESS and Consite suggested that
another transcription factor, Sp1, might also bind to the
wild type 34-nt segment. Sp1 has also been shown earlier
to recognize standard MAZ binding site, GA box [35,36].
In this study, as mentioned above, the Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide could compete with the 34-nt probe for
binding to transcription factors in the HepG2 nuclear
extract. With EMSA, we observed that low concentrations
of Sp1 retarded the probe migration; while in the presence
of a higher concentration of Sp1, higher mobility shift signals were observed (Fig. 6A). This phenomenon was consistent with previous reports that Sp1 readily forms a
homo-oligomeric complex as concentration is increased
[37]. Moreover, when HepG2 nuclear extract and biotinlabeled 34-nt probe were mixed following DAPA, Sp1
apparently bound to the wild type 34-nt oligonucleotide

and the mutant-62/-48 oligonucleotide, but not to the
mutant-74/-65 or double mutant oligonucleotide (Fig.
6B). A combination of approach with TESS and Consite
predictions, EMSA, and DAPA allowed us to precisely map
the Sp1 binding site at -74/-65, overlapping with the conventional GA box for MAZ binding within in the 34-nt
segment of the edn promoter.
Competitive binding of Sp1 and MAZ in vitro
As aforementioned, we have evidently shown that either
Sp1 or MAZ binds to the GA box within the 34-nt oligonucleotide. It is possible that Sp1 and MAZ may antagonize each other and compete for GA box binding. To
further investigate the competitive binding the GA box
region and MAZ as well as Sp1, we performed EMSA
experiments using recombinant between GST-MAZ and
Sp1. We combined radiolabeled wild type probe with
increasing concentrations of GST-MAZ in the presence of
a fixed amount of Sp1. Both MAZ and Sp1 formed a single, distinct protein-DNA complex with wild type probe.
As the relative ratio of MAZ over Sp1 exceed 500 ng, the
amount of MAZ-DNA complex gradually increased,
whereas that of Sp1-DNA complex drastically diminished.
On the country, as the relative ratio of Sp1 over GST-MAZ
that increased up to 20 ng, the amount of Sp1-DNA complex evidently increased, while the amount of MAZ-DNA
complex dramatically declined. (Fig. 7B) Thus, we have
clearly demonstrated the interplay between MAZ and Sp1
in terms of competition for the same binding site located
in the 34-nt segment.
Sp1 and MAZ bind to the edn promoter in vivo
While direct binding between MAZ or Sp1 and the 34-nt
sequence stretch of the human edn promoter was verified
by the abovementioned in vitro experiments, physical evidence for such interaction in vivo is further studied. With
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), we observed
that the 34-nt region of the human edn promoter could be
pulled down by anti-Sp1 but not preimmune antibody
(Fig. 8A), This observation lends credence to the conclusion that endogenous Sp1 indeed binds to the edn promoter at a specific region in vivo.

The available anti-MAZ could only recognize the DNA
binding surface on MAZ such that it was not suitable for
use in the ChIP assay. To overcome this problem, we
developed a ChAP assay that did not require an antibody.
For this assay, pcDNA/MAZ-6H was transiently transfected into HepG2 cells, and soluble chromatin was generated by sonication. The MAZ-bound chromatin was
pulled down by nickel resin, and the DNA was amplified
by PCR with edn promoter-specific primers. As expected,
our modified method demonstrated in vivo MAZ binding
to the human edn promoter (Fig. 8B). Moreover, the binding activity was dramatically reduced when mutant MAZ

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/89

lacking of the DNA binding domain was transfected. As a
control, non-specific binding was not detected when only
the pcDNA was transfected into the HepG2 cells. Our
results clearly support that both Sp1 and MAZ bind to the
human edn promoter in vivo.
Sp1 and MAZ differentially regulate edn promoter activity
in vivo
To distinguish the functions of Sp1 and MAZ in transactivation of the edn promoter, the reporter constructs were
used to transfect HepG2 cells in the presence or absence of
Sp1- or MAZ-expression vector. Interestingly, edn promoter activity was significantly inhibited in the presence
of ectopically expressed MAZ, whereas MAZ had no effect
on pGL3-edn∆(-81/-48), the edn promoter lacking the crucial 34-nt segment. As anticipated, the inhibitory effect
diminished when functionally defective MAZ (MAZ∆F34)
was overexpressed (Fig. 9A). On the other hand, the edn
promoter activity was increased significantly in the presence of ectopically expressed Sp1. Nevertheless, Sp1 did
not enhance the edn promoter activity in the absence of
the critical 34-nt region (Fig. 9B). Our results strongly suggest that MAZ and Sp1 serve respectively as a repressor and
an activator, in the regulation of edn transcription through
interaction with the 34-nt sequence motif. In Fig. 2C
above, we showed that deletion of the 34-nt region
resulted in decreased edn promoter activity. We surmise
that Sp1 binds mainly to the 34-nt region in vivo transactivating edn expression.

To further demonstrate the critical role that Sp1 plays in
edn promoter activity, RNAi was used to deplete endogenous Sp1 in HepG2 cells. Two sets of double-stranded
RNA oligonucleotides (Sp1/RNAi-1 and Sp1/RNAi-2) corresponding to human Sp1 were separately transfected into
HepG2 cells. Western blot analysis of cell lysates collected
72 hrs after transfection revealed that both Sp1/RNAi-1
and Sp1/RNAi-2 effectively depleted endogenous Sp1
protein (Fig. 9C). As a control, β-actin was unaffected by
RNAi treatment, indicating the specificity of the RNAi
effect and that equivalent amounts of protein were loaded
on the gel. Fig. 9D showed that cotransfection with Sp1/
RNAi-1 or Sp1/RNAi-2 decreased the edn promoter activity to 40% and 50% relative to control, respectively. When
the 34-nt region was deleted from the edn promoter, the
effect of RNA interference on Sp1 was less apparent.
Taken together, our results demonstrate that the regulatory roles of MAZ and Sp1 on transactivation of human
edn govern the differential expression of the duplicated
eosinophil rnases and that binding between these transcription factors and the 34-nt region in the edn promoter
determines its expression.

was approximately 1000 bp. The samples were then analyzed
by the ChIP assay for Sp1, using IgG as a negative control.
The samples were subjected to 30 cycles of PCR and separated on a 2% agarose gel. (B) ChAP assays were performed
using HepG2 cells transfected with pcDNA3/MAZ-6H,

with nickel resin slurry for 1 hr at 4°C. The affinity precipitated DNA/protein complexes were eluted by 1 M imidazole
and subjected PCR amplification. Input DNA served as a positive control.

Discussion
Both edn and ecp have been postulated to have emerged
from a gene duplication event after divergence of Old
World and New World monkeys, as well as the most rapidly evolving coding sequences of primate ribonuclease
genes. Variance in their promoter sequences may imply
that another key deletion or insertion event occurred
before the separation of hominoids and Old World monkeys [4]. Our observations as indicated in the putative
phylogenic tree of the promoter regions of representative
primate edn and ecp promoters (Fig. 1B and 1C) led to a
hypothesis that deletion of the 34-nt sequence stretch

The upstream 1-kb sequences between human edn and ecp
share 92% pairwise identity, but a major difference lies
within a 34-nt (-81/-48) region, which was present in all
the primate edn promoters we studied. Interestingly, we
discovered that this characteristic 34-nt motif also is in the
ecp promoter derived from macaque, an Old World Monkey. Based on the phylogenic tree of edn and ecp promoter
sequences generated by the maximum parsimony
method, a deletion of the unique 34-nt sequence stretch
was proposed to occur in the lineage of Old World Monkeys and Hominoids. We showed further by transcriptional activity assays that expression of edn and ecp in
HepG2 cells were positively correlated with the presence
of the critical 34-nt segment. Transcription activity of the
ecp promoter increased as a result of insertion of the 34-nt
segment, but remained significantly lower than that of the
wild type edn promoter. Furthermore, transcriptional
activity of the edn promoter with deletion of the 34-nt segment was higher than that of the wild type ecp promoter.
Thus, we speculate that other crucial cis transcription elements located in the divergent regions between human
ecp and edn promoters may exist. Besides the 34-nt region
of interest, BLAST analysis identified six additional divergent regions between human ecp and edn promoter
sequences (Table 1). It may be worthwhile to further
investigate the regulatory roles of these short motifs. It
should be noted that some transcription factors such as
PU.1 [26], C/EBP [22] have been characterized to enhance
edn transcriptional activity. It is thus reasonable to speculate that PU.1 and C/EBP can also enhance ecp promoter
activity based on the sequence indentity of the correspondent transcription elements in ecp promoter.
The characteristic 34-nt sequence motif in the edn promoter enhanced the transcriptional activity in HepG2
(Fig. 2) as well as HL-60 clone 15 cells (Supplementary
Fig. 1). EMSA with HepG2 nuclear extracts and 34-nt promoter probe revealed specific mobility shift patterns, suggesting that the 34-nt segment contains a region essential
for transactivation of edn in HepG2 cells. When HepG2
nuclear extract bound to the wild type 34-nt probe, excess
unlabeled wild type oligonucleotide, but not oligonucleotides containing site-specific mutations at -74/-65 or 62/-48, competed effectively for binding to the nuclear
proteins. Thus, both conserved regions -74/-65 and -62/48 were associated with the transcription factors, and elevation of the transcriptional activity in the cells was also
verified by the reporter assay.
MAZ is a transcriptional factor with six zinc fingers that
bind to a GA box (GGGAGGG) at the ME1a1 site [33,38].
Its rabbit and mouse homologs are identified as SAF-1

moter 9 regulatory roles of MAZ and Sp1 on transactivation through binding to the 34-nt sequence motif of the edn proDifferential
Differential regulatory roles of MAZ and Sp1 on transactivation through binding to the 34-nt sequence motif of
the edn promoter. (A) Cotransfections and luciferase assays were performed with HepG2 cells in the presence of pcDNA3,
pcDNA3/MAZ or pcDNA3/MAZ∆F34. (B) Similar to (A), but cotransfection was performed with pcDNA3 or pcDNA3/Sp1.
(C) Cells were transfected with 40 pmol/well Sp1/RNAi1, Sp1/RNAi2, or RNAi control. Forty-eight hours later, cells were harvested and protein lysates were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane that was probed for Sp1 or
actin. (D) Cotransfections and luciferase assays using wt and ∆ (-81/-48) edn promoter constructs were carried out with
HepG2 cells in the presence of control RNAi, Sp1/RNAi1 or Sp1/RNAi2. The difference between the two groups is statistically.

[34] and Pur-1, respectively. MAZ has also been shown to
bind the upstream regions of various genes, including
CD4 [39], NMDA receptor subunit type I [40], recombination activating gene-1 (RAG-1) [41], PTH-related peptide
receptor [36], phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase
(PNMT) [42], serotonin 1a receptor [43], insulin I and II
[44], nitric oxide synthase (NOS) [45] and p21 [46], and
also is involved in RNA polymerase II termination [47]
and adenovirus major late promoter activation [48]. Our
study has advanced further that MAZ binds the 34-nt
region through the third and fourth zinc fingers, extending its effects on transcriptional activity. We were surprised that unlabeled EMSA competitors m10 to m17 did
not appreciably compete the major band shift even
though these competitors all contained the full-length GA
box believed to be tightly bound by MAZ. Comprehensive
EMSA scanning mutagenesis revealed that MAZ bound
not only to the known GA box but also to another con-

served site, CTCTGCTG, an apparently novel transcription
factor binding motif. Thus, we postulate that some other
cofactor protein(s) may bind to the CTCTGCTG motif to
further enhance MAZ binding, and thus mutations at any
position in this novel motif leads to decreased MAZ binding (Fig. 5). Interestingly, even in the absence of another
protein(s), MAZ alone had strong binding activity because
GST-MAZ bound the wild type 34-nt probe (Fig. 4B).
Notably, MAZ always cooperates with another transcription factor, such as Sp1, to control promoter activity
[35,42,43,49,50]. The discovery of two sites critical for
MAZ binding is consistent with our luciferase assay
results. As shown in Figure 2C, mutation in either the -74/
-65 or -62/-48 region led to reduced luciferase activity
almost equal to that of pGL3-edn without the 34-nt
region. Furthermore, the ChAP assay showed that MAZ
bound to the 34-nt region of the human edn promoter in
HepG2 cells in vivo (Fig. 7C).

In addition to MAZ, the transcription factor Sp1 also
bound the GA box (Fig. 6). In vivo Sp1 binding to the 34nt sequence was also demonstrated by ChIP assay (Fig.
7A). Sp1 preferentially recognizes a guanidine nucleotiderich sequence. [51] MAZ and Sp1 cooperatively regulate
many genes such as NOS, PNMT, and those encoding
serotonin 1a receptor and parathyroid hormone
[42,43,45,52]. Most studies report the binding site for
MAZ near or partially overlapping that of Sp1.
In our study using HepG2 cells, cotransfection with MAZ
DNA and reporter plasmid containing the edn promoter
revealed that MAZ functioned as a repressor with respect
to regulation of transcriptional activity in the presence of
the 34-nt sequence region. Such repression effect was
reversed when the 34-nt segment was removed, indicating
that the 34-nt region served as the MAZ-responsive element in the edn promoter (Fig. 8A). In contrast, Sp1 is
considered to play a role as an activator based on the
observation derived from cotransfection with Sp1 DNA
and the reporter plasmid containing the edn promoter
(Fig. 8B). Previous studies have shown that MAZ and Sp1
recognize the same cis-elements in promoters and thereby
regulate gene expression independently [35]. Song et al.
have found that MAZ and Sp1 associate with histone
deacetylase and DNA methyltransferase, respectively, to
regulate transcriptional activity [35].

Conclusion
In conclusion, we characterized the presence of an evolutionarily conserved 34-bp sequence in all primate genes
encoding eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (edn) genes and
only one gene encoding eosinophil cationic protein (ecp).
Given the fact that primate edn and ecp are known to be
products of gene duplication event,such a conserved 34bp sequence motif constituted a region essential for transactivation of human edn in hepatocellular carcinoma
cells. Our findings indicate that Sp1 as well as MAZ constitutively bind at 34-nt region of the edn promoter in
HepG2 cells in vivo, and that the activity of the promoter
primarily depends on competition between Sp1 and MAZ.

Furthermore, our data reveal that Sp1 binds at the 34-nt
region and activates edn gene expression, on the contrary,
MAZ represses edn gene expression upon binding to the
34-nt region. The underlying molecular mechanisms
about Sp1 and MAZ cooperation in governing edn promoter activity still remain to be further investigation.

Methods
Cell culture and transient transfection
Cells from non-human primates including Saimiri sciureus, Macaca fascicularis, Pongo pygmaeus, Gorilla gorilla and
Pan troglodytes were purchased from Coriell Institute for
Medical Research and their cultures maintained at Dr.
Chung-I Wu's Laboratory (University of Chicago). All
non-human primate cell cultures were maintained in
alpha-modified minimum essential medium (α-MEM)
plus 10% non-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS). HepG2
cells were cultured in DMEM medium (Sigma) containing
10% heat-inactivated FCS. HL-60 clone 15 promyelocytic
leukemia cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium with
10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 25 mM
HEPPSO (N-[2-hydroxyethyl]piperazine-N-[2-hydroxypropanesulfonic acid] (Sigma), and maintained at pH 7.6.
Exponentially growing cells at 95% confluence were
trypsinized prior to genomic DNA purification employing
the Wizard® Genomic DNA purification kit (Promega). All
cells were cultured in a 37°C incubator under 5% CO2 in
air. For transient transfections, the HepG2 and HL-60
clone 15 cell lines were treated with Transfast (Promega)
and electroporation, respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions.

RNA interference (RNAi) duplexes directed against Sp1
and irrelevant control RNAi (cat. no: 12935-100) were
purchased from Invitrogen Life Technologies. The two targeted sequences used to silence Sp1 were 5'-GCAGACACAGCAGCAACAAAUUCUU-3'
and
5'GGAACAUCACCUUGCUACCUGUCAA-3'. Each RNAi
was separately transfected into target cells using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen Life Technologies).

Amplification of Upstream Regions of Primate edn and
ecp
The primer sets, #1/#2 and #3/#4, were designed based on
sequences of the first exon and the upstream region of the
corresponding human edn and ecp to amplify approximately 1-kb upstream fragments from the transcription
start sites, respectively (Supplementary Table 1). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was conducted at 95°C for 5 min
followed by 30 cycles of 95°C for 30 sec, 55°C for 30 sec,
and 72°C for 90 sec. The desired fragments were purified
and cloned into pGEM-T easy vector (Promega). The
sequences were confirmed using automated DNA
sequencing with the BigDye® Terminator V3.1 Cycle
Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems), and the reaction
products were analyzed with a ABI PRISM® 3100 Genetic
Analyzer.
Plasmid construction
The fragments of human edn and ecp promoters from
nucleotides -1,000 to +297 were amplified using primer
sets #5/#6 and #7/#8, respectively, from human genomic
DNA to generate the luciferase reporter plasmids pGL3edn and pGL3-ecp. The transcriptional start site of edn previously defined by Tiffany HL et al [27] to be located 23
nucleotides 3' from a consensus TATA box was used. That
of the ecp was assumed to be at the correspondent site.

For mutant reporter plasmids, the edn ∆(-81/-48), ednmut (-74/-65), edn-mut (-62/-48) and ecp+(-81/-48) were
generated using primer sets #9/#10, #11/#12, #13/#14,
#15/#16, respectively, by Quik-Change Site-Directed
Mutagenesis (Stratagene). The reactions were conducted
at 95°C for 5 min followed by 20 cycles of 95°C for 30
sec, 55°C for 30 sec and 72°C for 12 min. After PCR
amplification, the products were treated with 2 U of DpnI
and separately transformed into E. coli Top10F'. The
mutant edn and ecp promoter sequences were confirmed
by DNA sequencing.
The pGEX/MAZ and pGEX/MAZ∆F34 expression plasmids were kindly provided by Dr. Kazunari K. Yokoyama
(Gene Engineering Division, Bioresource Center, Tsukuba
Institute, RIKEN, 3-1-1 Koyadai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050074, Japan). The Sp1 expression plasmid, pcDNA3/Sp1,
was obtained from Dr. Jacob Bar-Tana (Department of
Human Nutrition and Metabolism, Hebrew University
Medical School, Jerusalem, P.O.). The inserts of pGEX/
MAZ and pGEX/MAZ∆F34 were subcloned into pcDNA3
(Invitrogen Life Technologies) to generate pcDNA3/MAZ6H and pcDNA3/MAZ∆F34-6H. The sequences of each
recombinant clone were determined by automated DNA
sequencing.

Development of multiple indexing sequence alignment
A novel method of MISA based on interval-jumping
searching algorithms and dynamic programming techniques was developed to identify characteristic features
among the query sequences [53,54]. The block-based pattern searching algorithms were designed to find short consensus motifs by a combination of hash encoding, quick
sorting and interval-jumping techniques; this was to avoid
unnecessary comparisons and to achieve approximate
matching functions. In this module, each possible subsegment of the imported sequences was considered as a fundamental element, and its contents are encoded as a
unique digital number and allocated in a corresponding
interval for the following matching procedures. Due to
the unique transformation and exact reconvertible features, the encoded numbers could be efficiently matched
in an ordered and well-defined interval. According to a
variable combination of parameter settings, we were able
to identify the consensus motifs with different properties
of pattern lengths, tolerance conditions, and occurrence
frequencies and label each of the sequences. Once the
consensus motifs were completely searched, a scoring
matrix of pairwise distant measurements is constructed to
select a referred indexed sequence prior to the multiple
alignment procedures. The MISA algorithms are then
implemented by performing dynamic programming and
merging processing in accordance with the assigned reference sequence based on the indexed fundamental elements instead of single residues. If there are k indexed
sequences under evaluation, the k pairwise alignments are
further combined and transformed into a k-row multiple
alignment indexing matrix through a multiple merging
process obeying the principle "once a gap, always a gap"
[55]. Finally, the aligned overlapped consensus labels
were combined as a representative segment to visually display the identified combinatorial patterns. To analyze primate eosinophil rnases in this paper, six edn and five ecp
promoter sequences of approximately 1 kb length in
FASTA format were input into MISA. Various combinations of fundamental pattern length, number of tolerant
residues, and occurrence rate were set to scan along the
full-length promoter sequences, and the results showed
consistent performance for the conserved regions as well
as the dominant portions of variation labeled in colorcoded bars and dotted grey grids, respectively.
Phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences
Primate ecp and edn promoter sequences were aligned
using MEGA 3.1 software. Phylogenetic trees were generated by the neighbor joining method with bootstrap resampling (data resampled 100 times) to assess the degree of
support for the phylogenic branching indicated by the
optimal tree. The exact numbers of nucleotides of M. fascicularis edn,P. pygmaeus edn, G. gorilla edn, P. troglodytes

analysis were respectively 921 bp, 923 bp, 921 bp, 921 bp,
921 bp, 931 bp, 883 bp, 887 bp, 887 bp, and 887 bp.
RNA isolation and RT-PCR
Total RNAs of HepG2 and HL-60 clone 15 cells were isolated by Trizol Reagent (Gibco) and the contaminant
genomic DNA was further digested by RNase-free DNaseI
(Promega). Two micrograms of total RNA and 0.5 µg
oligo-dT were added in a sterile RNase-free microcentrifuge tube, heated at 70°C for 5 min to melt secondary
structure within the template. A mixture containing 5 µl
M-MLV 5× Reaction buffer (Promega), 1.25 µl 10 mM
dNTP, 1 µl recombinant RNasin rib nuclease inhibitor
(Promega), M-MLV RTase (Promega), and nuclease-free
water were added to a final volume of 25 µl. The reverse
transcription reaction was performed at 42°C for 1 hr in a
thermal cycler (ASTEC, PC808). For each reaction, 5
nmole of forward and reverse primers (edn: 5'-CTCACTCCATGTCAAACCT-3', 5'-GCCGTTGATAATTGTTAAGGA3', and ecp: 5'-TATGCAGACAGACCAGGATGG-3' and 5'GGAACCACAGGATACCGTGGAGAA-3') and 80 ng
cDNA were incubated with 1.25 units of Ex Taq™ (Takara),
6.25 nmole dNTPs and Ex Taq™ polymerase buffer. The
PCR products were electrophoresed on a 2.0% agarose gel
and stained with ethidium bromide.
Promoter activity assays
After forty-eight hours transfection with individual pGL3,
pGL3-edn, pGL3-ecp reporter plasmids, the cells were
washed twice with PBS and lysed by Passive Lysis Buffer
(Promega). The lysates were centrifuged at 16,500 × g for
1 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was collected. The firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured by TD20/20 luminometer (Victor), and the relative activity was
calculated by simply dividing luminescence intensity
obtained from the assay for firefly luciferase by that of
Renilla luciferase.
Preparation of nuclear extract
Nuclear extracts were prepared by NE-PER nuclear extraction kit (Pierce). In brief, about 5 × 107 HepG2 cells were
trypsinized, collected and suspended in 200 µl CER I
buffer and incubated for 10 min on ice. After 11 µl CER II
was added and incubated for 1 min on ice, the cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were separated by centrifugation
at 16,500 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Cytoplasmic extracts in the
supernatant fraction were transferred into a clean microcentrifuge tube, whereas the pellets were resuspended by
adding 100 µl ice-cold NER and the mixture was incubated for 40 min on ice. The mixture was finally centrifuged at 16,500 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Nuclear extracts in
the supernatant fraction were transferred into a clean
microcentrifuge tube and stored at -80°C until use. Concentrations of proteins in lysates were determined with

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/89

BCA kit (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin (fraction V)
as the standard.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA)
The oligonucleotide sequences used in this study are listed
in supplementary Table 2. DNA annealing was performed
by heating 10 µM of each complementary strand of the
oligonucleotide to 95°C for 10 min, followed by cooling
gradually to 25°C over a period of three hours. The oligonucleotides corresponding to wild type and mutant 34-nt
segments were separately synthesized to span the -86 and
-48 region of the human edn promoter. The wild type
probe used for EMSA was end-labeled by incubation with
T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. The labeled
probes were then individually purified by passing through
a Sephadex G-25 spin column (GE Healthcare). Binding
reactions were conducted with 1 µl [γ-32P]-labeled probe,
20 µg nuclear extract protein, 1 µg poly (dI-dC), 10 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM
EDTA, and 10% glycerol in a total volume of 20 µl, and
the reactions were incubated at 30°C for 30 min. For competition experiments, the nuclear extracts were carried out
with a 200-fold molar excess of double-stranded competitor oligonucleotide at 30°C for 30 min prior to the addition of radiolabeled probes. To identify the transcription
factors constituting in the protein-DNA binding complexes, anti-Sp1 (PEP2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or
anti-MAZ (Dr. Kenneth Marcu, State University of New
York, Stonybrook, NY) was included in the binding reactions. The protein-DNA complexes were resolved by 6%
non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using
45 mM Tris, 45 mM boric acid, and 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.3).
The gel was dried and exposed to X-ray film at -70°C using
an intensifying screen.
Expression and purification of GST fusion proteins
pGEX/MAZ and pGEX/MAZ∆F34 were introduced into E.
coli BL21 (DE3), and synthesis of each fusion protein was
induced by addition of 0.5 mM isopropylb-d-thiogalactopyranoside to the LB culture medium. Proteins were purified with glutathione-agarose beads according to the
manufacturer's protocol (GE Healthcare).
DNA affinity precipitation assay (DAPA)
The oligonucleotide corresponding to -84 to -48 bp
within the edn promoter as well as mutant oligonucleotides were individually biotinylated at the 5'-terminus
and then annealed with their complementary strands. All
reactions were carried out at 4°C with gentle rocking
unless otherwise noted. DAPA was performed by incubating 400 µg of nuclear extract with 20 µg poly (dI-dC) in
binding buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 10 mM
(NH4)2SO4, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1% (w/v)
Tween 20, 100 mM KCl) that was pre-cleaned with 50 µl
streptavidin-agarose beads (GE Healthcare) for 1 hr, and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/89

then the supernatant was incubated with 2 µg of biotinylated DNA oligonucleotide for 4 hr or overnight. The
protein-DNA complexes were incubated with 20 µl
streptavidin-agarose beads for 1 hr prior to collection and
washed five times with binding buffer containing 0.5%
(w/v) Nonidet P-40. Sample buffer (2×) was added to the
streptavidin-precipitated DNA-protein complex and subsequently boiled for 10 min. The proteins were resolved
by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed
by western blot detection with specific antibodies.

Western blotting
After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred onto a
nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare). The membrane was incubated in 3% BSA at 25°C for 1 hr prior to
incubation overnight with anti-Sp1 or anti-SAF-1 (Dr.
Alpana Ray, Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO), followed by secondary antibody HRP-conjugated IgG (1:5000, Jackson
ImmunoResearch) for 2 hr. The target proteins were visualized by the ECL system (Pierce).

Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP)
The ChIP assay kit and anti-Sp1 were purchased from
Upstate Biotechnologies and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoprecipitations were performed at 4°C overnight with 5 µg primary antibody.
Immune complexes were harvested with protein A-Sepharose beads (60 µl/precipitation) as described. Following
immunoprecipitation, washing, and purification of DNA,
the samples were dissolved in water and used as templates
for PCR amplification using two primers: 5'-AAGTGGACTATGTACCAAT-3' and 5'-GGAACTGTTTAAATAAAGCA3' to generate a 108-bp fragment. The reactions were conducted at 95°C for 5 min followed by 28 cycles of 95°C
for 30 sec, 60°C for 30 sec and 72°C for 15 sec.

Statistical analysis
All experiments were performed at least three times, each
in duplicate. The data are expressed as the means ± S.E.
For comparison, the data were analyzed using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. The cutoff for statistical significance
was set as P < 0.05.

Chromatin affinity precipitation assay (ChAP)
An expression plasmid for His-tagged full-length MAZ,
pcDNA3/MAZ-6H was transiently transfected into HepG2
cells. Two days after transfection, cells (1 × 107) were
cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at
30°C. The treated cells were washed two times with icecold PBS, and the cell lysate was then collected with lysis
buffer. The chromatin was fragmented by sonication to an
average size of 1 kb and centrifuged at 16,000 × g at 4°C
for 10 min. The supernatant was diluted fivefold with 1×
binding buffer (500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9)
containing protease inhibitors and mixed well with 50 µl
salmon sperm DNA-saturated nickel resin slurry (GE
Healthcare) for 1 hr. The resin was precipitated followed
by washing two times with 1 ml binding buffer and two
times with 1 ml wash buffer (50 mM imidazole, 0.5 M
NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9). Protein-DNA complexes
were eluted from the His-binding resin with 100 µl of elution buffer (1 M imidazole, 0.5 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 7.9) two times. The protein-DNA crosslinks were
reversed by heating at 65°C overnight, and proteins were
digested with proteinase K (0.5 mg/ml) at 55°C for 1 hr.
DNA was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and
ethanol precipitation. DNA from the complexes was analyzed by PCR amplification using the same primer pair for
ChIP assay.
