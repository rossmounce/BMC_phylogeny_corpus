Abstract
Background: Theory predicts that speciation can be quite rapid. Previous examples comprise a
wide range of organisms such as sockeye salmon, polyploid hybrid plants, fruit flies and cichlid
fishes. However, few studies have shown natural examples of rapid evolution giving rise to new
species in marine environments.
Results: Using microsatellite markers, we show the evolution of a new species of brown
macroalga (Fucus radicans) in the Baltic Sea in the last 400 years, well after the formation of this
brackish water body ~8–10 thousand years ago. Sympatric individuals of F. radicans and F. vesiculosus
(bladder wrack) show significant reproductive isolation. Fucus radicans, which is endemic to the
Baltic, is most closely related to Baltic Sea F. vesiculosus among north Atlantic populations,
supporting the hypothesis of a recent divergence. Fucus radicans exhibits considerable clonal
reproduction, probably induced by the extreme conditions of the Baltic. This reproductive mode
is likely to have facilitated the rapid foundation of the new taxon.
Conclusion: This study represents an unparalleled example of rapid speciation in a species-poor
open marine ecosystem and highlights the importance of increasing our understanding on the role
of these habitats in species formation. This observation also challenges presumptions that rapid
speciation takes place only in hybrid plants or in relatively confined geographical places such as
postglacial or crater lakes, oceanic islands or rivers.

Background
Speciation is one of the most fundamental processes in
evolutionary biology. It is a process in which the within
population variation transforms into distinguishable
groups of individuals through the evolution of intrinsic
reproductive barriers [1]. The speed at which this process
happens is still intriguing and controversial [2] but estimates of speciation rates generally show that 105–107

years (yrs) are needed for new species to evolve [3]. However, theory predicts that speciation can happen more
quickly -often called "contemporary" or "rapid evolution"-, particularly in new or extreme environmental conditions where selection for adaptation is strong [2,4,5].
Despite these theoretical expectations, the evidence of
rapid speciation is primarily limited to classical evolutionary models such as cichlid fishes in discrete geographical

spaces as a Nicaraguan crater lake [6] where competition
is expected to be high and reproductive isolation is likely
to occur within, or Hawaiian fauna [7] where the high
number of species are more likely to drive speciation [8].
Evidence is also provided from fruit flies under laboratory
conditions [9], from homoploid and polyploid hybrid
plants [10,11] and from anadromous sockeye salmon in
which some degree of reproductive isolation evolved after
13 generations [12]. For marine species, support for rapid
speciation derives from the "white" sticklebacks and
although the evidence is consistent with a rapid species
origin, the estimates of divergence time do not correspond
with the glacial history of these systems [13]. Hence, the
rapid foundation of new species in the marine environment remains to be proven.
In the marine realm, genetic divergence between populations is expected to evolve relatively slowly as recruits and
propagules are readily transported by ocean currents [14].
Hitherto, time estimates for marine speciation events that
agree with geological events confirm the expectations of
slow speciation; for example, the reproductive isolation
between sister lineages of marine shrimps was completed
>3.5 million years ago (Mya) [15], after the rise of the Isthmus of Panama.
The Baltic Sea, today a large postglacial brackish-water
basin of the NE Atlantic, hosts a low number of marine
species. These species (together with a number of other
now extinct ones), invaded the Baltic from the Atlantic
during an earlier period of more marine conditions (4–8
thousand years ago, kya) and survived the shift 4 kya to
the present day, where the low-saline environment (<10
practical salinity units, psu) creates an unusual marine
ecosystem. One of these species, the bladder wrack Fucus
vesiculosus, is widely distributed in the sub-Arctic and temperate regions of northern Atlantic, and is currently the
most dominant and ecologically important perennial
large brown alga in the Baltic [16]. In the Gulf of Bothnia
(northern Baltic Sea), F. vesiculosus coexists with a smaller
and morphologically distinct taxon, Fucus radicans [17].
Fucus radicans is smaller and has a bushy appearance in
comparison to F. vesiculosus, and the thalli of F. radicans
are always less wide than those of F. vesiculosus (Fig. 1). In
contrast to the pan-Atlantic distribution of F. vesiculosus, F.
radicans is endemic to the Baltic Sea. Previous analyses
suggested that both taxa are reproductively isolated, but
this conclusion was based on a single sympatric locality
from the south part of the Gulf of Bothnia [17,18]. Subsequent studies could not, however, resolve the evolutionary relationships between F. radicans and F. vesiculosus
using chloroplast (RuBisCO gene) [17] or mitochondrial
(intergenic spacer) [19] DNA sequence markers. Therefore, the question is whether these two species correspond
to previously diverged lineages that remained different
after the Last Glacial Maximum 8 kya or if F. radicans

evolved following the last ice age, presumably inside the
Baltic Sea. Here, we supplemented previous studies with
four additional sympatric sites inside the Baltic and with
two sites outside this region as outgroups. We also
increased the set of microsatellite loci to nine. Altogether,
these provided us with tools to: a) assess the reproductive
isolation between F. radicans and F. vesiculosus in the supplementary populations and with the additional loci; b)
determine the phylogeographic affinities of F. radicans; c)
estimate the time of divergence of F. radicans from F. vesiculosus to determine whether F. radicans originated
recently, after the formation of the Baltic Sea and; d) to
discern the mechanisms responsible for the reproductive
isolation between F. radicans and F. vesiculosus.

Results and discussion
Reproductive isolation
We assessed the reproductive isolation in four sympatric
populations of F. radicans and F. vesiculosus, where both
taxa are frequent in SW Gulf of Bothnia (Fig. 2A) and with

an increased set of microsatellite loci (9 instead of 5 from
the earlier study [17]). Only individuals firmly attached to
the bottom and with attached representatives of the other
taxon within a distance of <1 m were used in the analyses.
However, the individuals representing identical genotypes
(clones) were removed for all subsequent analyses (see
Methods). Thus, in total we used 235 Fucus individuals
with unique genotypes. All microsatellite loci were polymorphic showing 5–21 different alleles per locus and heterozygosity values (He) ranging from 0.101 to 0.827 in
both Fucus species (table 1). As for the reproductive isolation of F. radicans, considerable differences are evident
from the allele frequency distributions across loci, particularly at loci Fsp1, L38, L58, and L94 (Fig. 3). At least one

allele represented with high frequency in each locus in F.
vesiculosus is not present in F. radicans, showing marked
differences between species. Subsequently, we performed
a factorial correspondence analysis to assess the species
cohesion without accounting for any historic or demographic pattern that may underlie the taxa identities.
These results showed a clear assembly among F. radicans
individuals, while some F. vesiculosus individuals
appeared scattered and a few more overlapping the F. radicans grouping (Fig. 2B). These overlapping individuals
suggest that the species divergence might have occurred in
the presence of gene flow, but without any demographic
information this suggestion should be interpreted with
caution. However, to determine whether this overlapping
is due to morphological misclassification or the presence
of hybrids we inferred individual ancestry using a Bayesian assignment analysis. Results from this analysis
showed a clear separation between F. radicans and F. vesiculosus individuals with additional genetic variation in the
latter that includes the potentially misclassified individuals. This clustering, however, had no discernable geographic pattern in F. vesiculosus but it separated
unambiguously those F. vesiculosus individuals that seem
to overlap with F. radicans from all the F. radicans individuals (Fig. 4, K = 3). It is also important to highlight the
genetic cohesiveness amongst F. radicans across 550 km of
coastline from Järnäs to Öregrund, providing further support of genetic isolation from F. vesiculosus. To further
determine the extent of gene flow within and between
species populations we used FST estimates, which are commonly used to investigate the magnitude of population
differentiation. From this analysis, it is clear that the sympatric populations of F. radicans and F. vesiculosus identified by morphological criteria (frond width, midrib width
and stipe width) [17] were indeed genetically isolated in
the SW Gulf of Bothnia (table 2). An overall FST = 0.160 (P
= 0.05) among species' populations indicates limited gene
flow between F. radicans and F. vesiculosus. Furthermore,
all F. radicans populations were significantly different
from those of F. vesiculosus and low, non-significant values
characterize F. radicans populations, showing added evidence of reproductive isolation. Large genetic variation
was also evident from these estimates among F. vesiculosus
populations in agreement with previous results showing
constrained gene flow in this species over short distances
[20]. Yet, the differences between F. radicans and F. vesiculosus at all sympatric localities were greater than those
observed within F. vesiculosus. Further results of the extent
of gene flow between species comes from coalescent –
based pairwise estimates of migration between both species' populations and effective population sizes. The 95%
highest probability distributions (HPD) of the number of
migrants per generation showed asymmetric gene flow
(Fig 5B–C). Migration values from F. vesiculosus to F. radicans had their highest probability near zero suggesting the
absence of gene flow in this direction (m1 = 1.01 × 10-4 –

detected from F. radicans to F. vesiculosus (m2 = 1.16 × 103 – 2.7 × 10-2), supporting the suggestion of recent divergence.
Phylogeographic affinities of F. radicans
We constructed a neighbour-joining tree based on CavalliSforza genetic distances adding samples from one allopatric locality of F. radicans and one of F. vesiculosus from
inside the Baltic, and three localities of F. vesiculosus from
outside the Baltic (North Sea, Norwegian Sea and White
Sea) (Fig. 2A). This analysis showed F. radicans emerging
as a single monophyletic taxon derived from a F. vesiculosus lineage, but distinct from F. vesiculosus with high bootstrap support (Fig. 2C). The population tree indicated a
close relationship between F. radicans and Gulf of Bothnia
F. vesiculosus, suggesting that F. radicans recently diverged
from this F. vesiculosus lineage. Further clustering of F.
vesiculosus populations mainly corresponds to geographical designations and the genetic distances between them

are in agreement with a previous study suggesting that this
divergence reflects constrained gene flow even at small
geographic scale [20].
Time of divergence
An alternative scenario to the hypothesis of recent speciation is that F. radicans may have originated outside the
Baltic and entered the newly formed sea as a previously
diverged lineage that remained differentiated (and
became extinct outside the Baltic Sea). This scenario is
weakened by our phylogeographic data: our neighbourjoining tree showed a close relationship of F. radicans with
Baltic populations of F. vesiculosus that strongly supports
an F. radicans origin within the Baltic. Yet, accurate times

of speciation are difficult to estimate due to the lack of variation in sequence loci. Neither nuclear or mtDNA
sequences were able to resolve the phylogenetic relationships between both taxa [17,19,21], further suggesting a
recent origin of F. radicans. Consequently, we calculated a
microsatellite-based estimate of time since divergence of
F. radicans and F. vesiculosus using a coalescent approach.
This analysis indicated that F. radicans and F. vesiculosus
started to diverge from a common panmictic population
sometime between 125 and 2475 yrs ago (95%HPD; posterior distribution peak at ~400 yrs ago, Fig. 5A). Hence,
separation took place after the Baltic underwent the transition from marine to brackish water, less than 4 kya. The
hypothesis that F. radicans arouse recently is further

strengthened by the fact that it is endemic to the Baltic
Sea.
Isolating mechanisms
We considered the mating system as a potential isolating
mechanism between F. radicans and F. vesiculosus. Fucus
vesiculosus has separate sexes and was until recently reported
to reproduce exclusively sexually through external fertilization. Experiments show limited capacity of F. vesiculosus to
reproduce in low salinities by reducing the longevity and
motility of the gametes [22,23], low fertilization success
and egg polyspermy [22]. However, asexual reproduction
(20%) has also been reported in Baltic populations of F.
vesiculosus [18]. Likewise, F. radicans has permanent and
well established populations in all its distributional range,
with separate sexes and sexual reproduction taking place
the same way as in F. vesiculosus. However, it shows high
extent of clonality and re-attachment experiments in both
species show that detached thallus fragments of F. radicans
have considerably higher capacity to re-attach (80%) than
those of F. vesiculosus (15%) [18].

Populations living in marginal environments typically
switch or are capable of asexual reproduction [24], and
this is also true for several species in the Baltic [25]. Thus,
the frequent clonal reproduction observed in F. radicans
coupled with the low capacity of F. vesiculosus to reproduce sexual or asexually at low salinities may have facilitated the divergence between both taxa. The evolution of
low-salinity tolerance might be seen as directional selection in F. radicans and F. vesiculosus. Clonality may have
evolved through a single F. radicans individual successfully colonizing and producing a population in the hyposaline environment or through reinforcement to reduce
gene flow from F. vesiculosus populations not adapted to
these conditions. In either case, reproductive isolation
would appear as a by-product of adaptation.
The Baltic is an ecologically marginal and geographically
peripheral marine habitat due to its permanent low salinity
and geographic semi-isolation from the Atlantic. The salinity gradient from the inner Baltic to the North Sea spans an
order of magnitude (3–30 psu), and has caused strong local
adaptation in most of the marine lineages that survived the
marine/brackish transition 4 kya [25]. Directional selection
is a strong promoter of speciation, even in the presence of
gene flow [26-28]. More specifically, environmental stress
along gradients has been highlighted as a potential source
of new species [29]. Although the exact mechanism of the
F. vesiculosus – F. radicans speciation event remains
unknown, the extreme environmental stress imposed by
the brackish water environment of the Baltic has clearly
contributed to the formation of the new species.

Conclusion
Fucus radicans is endemic to the Baltic Sea that formed
only 8–10 kya. This species diverged from F. vesiculosus

and divergence time estimates suggest that they split
about 400 yrs ago. These dates are consistent with the
transition of the Baltic from marine to brackish water, less
than 4 kya and provide an unparalleled example of rapid
speciation in marine ecosystems. These closely related
species also offer further opportunities to increase our
understanding of the role of species-poor systems -where
competition is low and gene flow is expected to be high-,
of peripheral extreme environments and of mixed reproductive modes in species formation.

Methods
Sample collection
Individuals of F. radicans and F. vesiculosus were collected
from four different areas along the Swedish coast. The area
of Öregrund (SW Gulf of Bothnia) included four sites in
which the distributional ranges of both species overlap
and individual plants occur in sympatry (Figs. 1, 2A and
2C). The following additional sites were also included:
one sampling site at Järnäs (NW Gulf of Bothnia) where
only F. radicans is found; Öregrund (OB, F. vesiculosus, n =
37, Fig. 2C); Öland (n = 43, Baltic) and Lysekil (n = 42,
Swedish west coast) where only F. vesiculosus occurs. Two
further populations of F. vesiculosus were sampled from
Norway (n = 20) and the White Sea (n = 18) for use as outgroups. Total number of unique genotypes used for the
analyses is provided in table 1.
Genotyping
DNA was extracted from dried algal tissue using DNeasy
Plant MiniKit and samples were genotyped at nine microsatellites developed from Fucus species [30,31]. Labelled
products were poolplexed and resolved on a BeckmanCoulter automated sequencer and CeqMan 8000 software
(Beckman-Coulter) was used for allele sizing.
Summary statistics
For each species, the probability of identity of genotypes
was calculated to distinguish between clones and identical
genotypes by chance using GIMLET http://pbil.univlyon1.fr/software/Gimlet/gimlet%20frame1.html.
The
individuals representing clones were removed for all subsequent analyses. Allele variation and genetic diversity
were obtained with POP100GENE http://www.montpel
lier.inra.fr/URLB/pop100gene/pop100gene.html (table 1
and Fig. 3). Tests for linkage disequilibrium, Hardy-Weinberg departures and their statistical significance were performed using GENEPOP 4.0 http://kimura.univmontp2.fr/%7Erousset/Genepop.htm.
Population differentiation and Bayesian population
assignment test
First, to identify and illustrate in the factorial space the
degree of similarity in allelic states between populations
of both taxa from Öregrund, where they occur in sympa-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/70

try, a factorial correspondence analysis (FCA) was carried
out using GENETIX 4.03 http://www.genetix.univmontp2.fr/genetix/genetix.htm (Fig. 2B). Subsequently,
to examine whether sympatric populations of F. radicans
and F. vesiculosus are genetically different and to measure
the difference magnitudes, F-statistics were calculated
using FSTAT 2.9.3 http://www2.unil.ch/popgen/soft
wares/fstat.htm and significance levels were Bonferronicorrected (table 2). Then, to assess the genetic affinities
between species and populations a neighbour-joining tree
was constructed using Cavalli-Sforza genetic distances
with 10,000 bootstrap support replicates on locus information using POPULATIONS http://bioinformatics.org/
~tryphon/populations/ (Fig. 2C). Finally, to provide an
alternative classification of individuals and identification
of potential hybrids, a Bayesian assignment analysis was
also performed using STRUCTURE 2.2 http://
pritch.bsd.uchicago.edu/software.html with a burn-in
period of 50,000 and 1,000,000 iterations. The algorithm
infers individual ancestry by assigning sampled individuals into a user-defined number of clusters (K)/populations
that minimize genotypic disequilibrium under the
assumption of random mating. The maximum number of
clusters was set to K = 5, (Fig. 4).
Estimation of demographic parameters of species
divergence
Coalescent-based estimates of time since divergence of the
two species and effective number of migrants per generation were calculated using IM http://lifesci.rutgers.edu/
~heylab/HeylabSoftware.htm#IM. Asymmetrical gene
flow (m1 ≠ m2) was allowed because preliminary runs
indicated that migration rates were different. Wide uninformative prior distributions were assigned based on three
preliminary trial runs. Metropolis coupling was implemented using 20 chains with a 20 chain swap attempts per
step and a geometric heating increment. A burn-in period
of 500,000 steps was used and results were recorded every
hour for >20,000,000 steps, so that the lowest effective
sample sizes (ESS) for each parameter were 500 [32]. To
test for the performance of the program, the analysis was
conducted five times under identical parameterization but
with different random number seeds. Given that the
mutation is critical to convert the coalescent estimates to
biologically informative demographic parameters, a series
of analyses were conducted using different mutation rates
to establish a confidence interval of coalescent estimates
(Fig. 6). The upper (5.2 × 10-4) and lower (1.1 × 10-3) 95%
confidence limits of mutation rate for nuclear microsatellite loci of plants [33] were used as reference. A point estimate of 7.7 × 10-4 for microsatellite with dinucleotide
repeats was also used from plants. However, since our
data comprises microsatellite loci with di- and trinucleotide repeats, mutation rates for each locus used in our
study were calculated indirectly using Msvar 1.3 http://

www.rubic.rdg.ac.uk/~mab/stuff/. These mutation rates
(2.5 × 10-4 geometric mean) produced the most conservative coalescent estimates from IM and therefore are the
ones presented in the main results (Fig. 5). Finally, a generation time of 6 yrs [34] was assumed to convert the coalescent estimates to demographic parameters.
