Abstract
Background: Germline mutations or large-scale deletions in the coding region and splice sites of
STK11/LKB1 do not account for all cases of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS). It is conceivable that, on
the basis of data from other diseases, inherited variation in promoter elements of STK11/LKB1 may
cause PJS.
Results: Phylogenetic foot printing and transcription factor binding site prediction of sequence 5'
to the coding sequence of STK11/LKB1 was performed to identify non-coding sequences of DNA
indicative of regulatory elements. A series of 33 PJS cases in whom no mutation in STK11/LKB1
could be identified were screened for sequence changes in the putative promoter defined by
nucleotides -1090 to -1472. Two novel sequence changes were identified, but were found to be
present in healthy individuals.
Conclusion: These findings indicate that promoter sequence changes are unlikely to contribute
to PJS.

Background
Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS; MIM 175200) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder typified by hamartomatous
polyposis of the gastrointestinal tract and melanin pigmentation of the oro-facial region [1]. Although germline
mutations in the coding sequence of the serine-threonine
kinase gene STK11/LKB1 have been found to cause PJS
[2,3], such mutations only account for up to 80% of cases
[4-12]. In addition to locus heterogeneity [13] mutations
in regulatory sequences of STK11/LKB1 may cause PJS.
Identifying regulatory genomic sequences through functional assays is time consuming and problematic. As natural selection is more likely to tolerate sequence changes
in redundant, non-functional sequence than in functionally important sequences, regulatory elements in noncoding sequence will be highly conserved through evolution. Comparison of sequence between both closely
related and highly divergent species therefore allows for
the identification of non-coding sequence that has a high
probability of being important to the regulation of gene
transcription. This alternative approach to the identification of promoter elements is termed "phylogenetic foot
printing" [14].
Here we describe the phylogenetic foot printing of the 5'
upstream region of STK11/LKB1 and the sequence analysis of this region in a series of PJS cases in whom exonic
and splice site mutations in the gene had been excluded.

Results and discussion
Figure 1 shows the evolutionary conserved region 5' of the
coding sequence of STK11 as identified by the phylogenetic foot-printing programs ECR Browser [15] and CONSITE [16]. There was a high degree of concordance
between the predictions from the programs. ECR Browser
predicted three regions of high conservation upstream of
STK11, encompassing nucleotides -981 to -1668 (nucleotide 0 representing the STK11 translation initiation signal). Sixteen transcription factor binding sites (TFBS)
predicted by rVista [17] resided between nucleotides 1053 and -1472. ConSite predicted 27 TFBSs conserved
between human and mouse between nucleotides -1090
and -1605. Through the integration of phylogenetic foot
printing and TFBS prediction data from ECR browser/
rVista and ConSite, a consensus region containing predicted TFBS positions was identified between nucleotides
-1090 to -1472.
Additional analysis using the TFBS prediction programs
Transplorer (Biobase Biological Databases, Wolfenbüttel,
Germany) and Proscan v1.7 [18] identified 9 binding sites
between nucleotides -1142 and -1724, and 76 binding
sites between nucleotides -881 and -1572 respectively,
confirming the presence of regulatory elements within the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/38

consensus region. ECR Browser/ rVista and ConSite have
previously been shown to correctly identify 88% and 66%
of TFBS in functionally verified promoter elements respectively[15,16] and it is highly likely, therefore, that the consensus region encompassing nucleotides -1090 to -1472,
contains STK11/LKB1 promoter elements.
DNA from a series of 33 PJS patients that did not harbour
germline STK11/LKB1 mutations (mean age at diagnosis
14 years, range 1–38) was studied for mutations in the
region between nucleotides -1001 to -1815, encompassing all TFBSs predicted by rVista and ConSite. Seven of the
cases had a documented family history of PJS. The diagnosis of PJS in all cases was based on established criteria [1].
Three sequence changes were identified. The change G →
C at position -1566 was found in four cases (three heterozygotes and one homozygote) and represented a previously documented single nucleotide polymorphism
(rs3795061). An additional single nucleotide change at
position -1268 (G → T) was identified in eight cases
(seven heterozygotes and four homozygotes). A single
sample of control DNA used as a sequence reference was
also found to be homozygous for the change. Finally, a
two base pair deletion coupled with a single base pair
insertion at position -1709 (n-1709insTdelCC) was identified in one case. A series of healthy population controls
(n = 92) was screened by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and one individual (1/92) was
found to harbour the sequence change. None of these
three sequence changes identified were therefore deemed
to be potentially pathogenic.
There is a high degree of redundancy in promoter elements of genes, however point mutations in promoter
regions of PTEN and MLH1 have been reported to be disease causing [19,20]. To investigate the possibility of
large-scale deletions or insertions undetectable by
straightforward PCR primers P1Fwd and P3Rev were used
to amplify an 814 bp fragment with products visualised
on a 2% agarose gel. No large-scale deletions or insertions
were detected in any of the patients.

Conclusion
As understanding of the contribution of coding sequence
changes to disease becomes clearer, attention will focus
on regulatory elements of genes. Phylogenetic foot printing using programs such as ECR browser and ConSite
present potentially powerful tools in identifying regulatory elements, enabling the analysis of these sequences
without time consuming functional studies. Although the
efficiency of in-silico delineation of promoter elements
has not been rigorously evaluated, ECR Browser/ rVista
and ConSite have been shown to correctly identify 88%
and 66% of TFBS respectively[15,16]. On the basis of our
findings, however, it appears unlikely (upper 95%

Methods
Bioinformatics
Phylogenetic foot printing of 3 Kb of sequence upstream
of human and mouse STK11/LKB1 (NT_011255) was performed using the promoter predication programs ECR
Browser [15] and CONSITE [16]. For both programs a

conservation cut-off of 70% identity over 100 base pairs
was adopted, in accordance with published criteria
[21,22]. Regions identified by ECR Browser with greater
than 70% conservation were analysed using the TFBS prediction program rVista v2.0 [17]. Conserved regions identified by ConSite were annotated with TFBSs based on the
JASPAR database [23] and links provide sequence information. Further analysis was carried out using the TFBS
prediction programs Proscan version1.7 [18] and Transplorer (Biobase Biological Databases, Wolfenbüttel, Ger-

many). The promoters and TFBS predicted by each
program were aligned to delineate a consensus region
indicative of a putative promoter.

Mutational analysis
The possession of germline mutations in STK11/LKB1,
including a large-scale deletion of the gene, was excluded
using methods previously described [24]. Mutational
analysis of the minimal consensus conserved region was
carried out by direct DNA sequencing in both directions
using the BigDye v3.1 Terminator Cycle Sequencing
Ready Reaction Kit in conjunction with an ABI3100 semiautomated genetic analyser (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, USA). Overlapping oligonucleotides amplifying
three fragments spanning the region were designed using
the Primer3 program [25]: P1Fwd – GCACAGGAGGGTTCAATATTTTC, P1Rev – TTGCGGACCTGGAAGGAG,
P2Fwd – ACTGGAATTGGCCACTTTGT, P2Rev – GATACAGCGCGCTCATTG, P3Fwd – GTCTCCCCATGCCTGCTTC, P3Rev – GGCCCAGCCCATCCAAGG. Predicted
PCR products were subjected to searches of the genome
using the BLAST program [26] to confirm specificity.
Chromatograms were analysed by two independent
researchers using the programs Chromas [27] and MutationSurveyor (SoftGenetics, State College, USA). High
performance liquid chromatography was performed using
the WAVE system (Transgenomics, Omaha, USA).
