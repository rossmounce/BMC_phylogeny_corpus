Abstract
Herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 and 2 are old viruses, with a history of evolution shared with
humans. Thus, it is generally well-adapted viruses, infecting many of us without doing much harm,
and with the capacity to hide in our neurons for life. In rare situations, however, the primary
infection becomes generalized or involves the brain.
Normally, the primary HSV infection is asymptomatic, and a crucial element in the early restriction
of virus replication and thus avoidance of symptoms from the infection is the concerted action of
different arms of the innate immune response. An early and light struggle inhibiting some HSV
replication will spare the host from the real war against huge amounts of virus later in infection. As
far as such a war will jeopardize the life of the host, it will be in both interests, including the virus,
to settle the conflict amicably. Some important weapons of the unspecific defence and the early
strikes and beginning battle during the first days of a HSV infection are discussed in this review.
Generally, macrophages are orchestrating a multitude of anti-herpetic actions during the first hours
of the attack. In a first wave of responses, cytokines, primarily type I interferons (IFN) and tumour
necrosis factor are produced and exert a direct antiviral effect and activate the macrophages
themselves. In the next wave, interleukin (IL)-12 together with the above and other cytokines
induce production of IFN-γ in mainly NK cells. Many positive feed-back mechanisms and synergistic
interactions intensify these systems and give rise to heavy antiviral weapons such as reactive oxygen
species and nitric oxide. This results in the generation of an alliance against the viral enemy.
However, these heavy weapons have to be controlled to avoid too much harm to the host. By IL4 and others, these reactions are hampered, but they are still allowed in foci of HSV replication,
thus focusing the activity to only relevant sites. So, no hero does it alone. Rather, an alliance of
cytokines, macrophages and other cells seems to play a central role. Implications of this for future
treatment modalities are shortly considered.

Introduction
Virus-host interactions are crucial for the outcome of
infections. Several strategies have been utilized by viruses

to overcome the host defence. For the virus to be successful, these evasive strategies have to be balanced with the
pathology induced and the possibilities of transmission to

new susceptible individuals. The mammalian host utilizes
ubiquitous and redundant antiviral defence mechanisms.
In different viral infections, different parts of the host
defence seem to be crucial. However, the redundancy
ensures that other systems are ready to take over, if one of
them fails. The final outcome of a viral infection depends
on a delicate regulation and timing of these antiviral effector mechanisms in response to the invading virus.

virinae together with varicella-zoster virus. These
alphaherpesviruses all show neurotropic latency, and
mucosal or skin lesions are frequently seen as a result of
viral reactivation from sensory nerves. The two types of
herpes simplex virus confer the genera Simplexvirus 1 and
-2, which were formally designated by the International
Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses as Human herpesvirus
(HHV) 1 and 2 [5].

A viral infection of an individual thus involves a conflict
between the virus and the host, which could conceptually
be viewed upon as a human controversy escalating to
invasion and armed struggle. To understand the resulting
course of events it is important to know each party of the
conflict and to conduct an analysis of the powerful weapons held by each of the combatants. The present review
analyzes the early non-specific events in the conflict upon
herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. Initially, each participant of the conflict, the infecting HSV and the non-specific antiviral weapons of the host, are described.
Subsequently, the early events of the conflict, the armament, early strikes and the opening battle between HSV
and the host are discussed. Insight into the early non-specific defence mechanisms are important for our understanding of the conflict and may indicate how to intervene
during serious systemic infections.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 and type 2 are very
closely related, showing a homology at the DNA level of
83% in protein coding regions and less in noncoding
regions [6]. The genetic map of the two herpes simplex
viruses is colinear [6], and the genomes are of approximately the same size, HSV-1 of 152 kbp [7] and HSV-2 of
155 kbp, and code for corresponding genes [6]. The minor
sequence variations give different cleavage sites for restriction endonucleases, which has been used intensively as an
important epidemiological tool [8-10].

The combatants – facts and hypotheses on
function
Herpes Simplex Virus
Herpesviruses are ubiquitous viruses generally infecting
humans early in life. The majority of humans has had a
primary infection with one or more herpesviruses and
harbour these viruses in a latent state for the rest of their
lives. The initial infection is most often asymptomatic, but
can be symptomatic depending on the herpesvirus in
question and the age and immune status of the host. The
viruses are phylogenetically old and humans and herpesviruses have evolved together [1]. This co-evolution has
created viruses which are well adapted to the human host
and environment. Thus, herpesviruses are capable of coping with the human immune defence in a balanced manner generally without serious threads to the life of the
host. Infection with a foreign herpesvirus, normally
hosted by another species, does not always hold this balance, and the pathology is unpredictable. This is seen
when humans are infected with the simian B virus, which
often shows serious clinical outcome [2].

The human herpes simplex viruses were initially identified by Lowenstein, who passed it onto rabbits in 1919,
and found it to be sensitive to alcohol and higher temperatures [3]. The viruses were classified into two serologically different types by Schneweiss in 1962 [4], and these
are now known to belong to the subfamily of Alphaherpes-

Structure of herpes simplex virus
As all other herpesviruses the herpes simplex viruses are
enveloped, icosahedral DNA viruses with a capsid of
approximately 100 nm (fig. 1)[1]. The envelope holds at
least 10 different glycoproteins protruding from the outer
side (gB, gC, gD, gE, gG, gH, gI, gK, gL, and gM). The glycoproteins are primarily responsible for attachment to cellular receptors and fusion of membranes (especially gB
and gD) [11-14]. In addition, there are two unglycosylated proteins in the viral envelope. The glycoproteins of
the envelope have several immunoregulatory effects
besides their primary more mechanical functions in viral
attachment and entry [15-19].

In the space between the envelope and the capsid, the
complete viral particles posses an almost amorphous
structure which was termed the tegument by Roizman and
Furlong [20]. The tegument consists of several viral proteins involved in the initial phases of viral infection and
replication such as transport of the viral DNA out of the
capsid [21], early shutoff of cellular protein synthesis
(vhs) [22], and initiation of transcription of viral genes
(α-trans-inducing factors) [23]. Besides the tegument seen
in complete viral particles, tegument-like structures are
seen in enveloped particles lacking a capsid and DNA, the
so called light particles [24,25].
The capsid is composed of a complex icosahedral structure of 162 capsomeres, each with a central channel running from the outside to the interior of the capsid. Inside
the capsid the double stranded linear DNA is packed as a
spool with the ends in close proximity [21,26,27]. The
genome consists of a long (L) and a short (S) segment
which are covalently linked [28], and contains a high density of genetic information with about 94 open reading

frames (ORF) and encodes approximately 84 polypeptides [7,29], of which only 37 are required for replication
of the virus in cultured cells [30,31]. The viral genes are
expressed in a cascade in groups classified as immediate
early (IE, α), early (β), early late (γ1) and late (γ2) genes,
each with a certain characteristic group of promoters regulating the sequential expression [29,32]. Generally, the
α-gene products are transcription inducers, the β-gene
products are viral enzymes such as the thymidine kinase
and the viral DNA polymerase, and the products of γgenes are the structural proteins of the viral particle [33].
The viral transcriptional chain is closed by some of the
tegument proteins (e.g. VP16/Vmw65) which are γ-gene
products with structural properties in the tegument of the
viral particle and besides this harbour transcriptioninducing capacity upon α-gene promoters crucial in the
induction of the next replication cycle of the virus [32,34].
Infection of the cell
The HSV infection is initiated by adsorption of the viral
particle via gB or gC to a cellular receptor, which is a
heparan sulphate chain on cellular proteoglycans [35].
Thus HSV adsorption can be inhibited by heparin and soluble heparan sulfates [36,37]. This initial binding, in
which gC is important but dispensable, is of greater significance for HSV-1 than for HSV-2, a divergence which

could have implications for the different pathogenic patterns of the two strains [38,39]. Furthermore, trapping of
HSV to heparan sulfate motives in the tissues, e.g. basal
laminas, may be of importance for containment of the
infection at a specific site [40]. Binding to the heparan sulfate-containing cellular receptors, which are in size with
the HSV particle itself, is reversible, and serves to concentrate the viral particle in near proximity to the cell (fig. 1)
[35,39,41].
A crucial step is then conducted by gD binding to an entry
receptor, of which three classes has been described [42].
These include herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM), later
designated as herpes virus entry protein A (HveA), which
is a member of the tumour necrosis factor receptor family,
nectin-1 (HveC) and nectin-2 (HveB), both members of
the immunoglobulin superfamily, and heparan sulfate
sites modified by 3-O-sulfotransferases [43-46]. The differential use of these receptors is of importance for HSV
entry of different cell types and infection of polarized cells
[47-51], exemplified by nectin-1, which is of importance
in infection of the vaginal mucosa [52]. Upon binding to
one of these entry receptors, conformational changes in
gD lead to interaction with gB or gH-gL dimer, which
results in membrane fusion by a mechanism not known
in detail (fig. 1) [41,53]. The membrane fusion can take
place both with the plasma membrane on the surface of
the target cell and with an endosomal membrane after
intraluminal pH-reduction, as it is seen for some other
enveloped viruses [50,54-56].
Following these initial steps of infection several immunomodulatory cellular events are induced, but the potential importance of signalling through receptors involved
in adsorption and membrane fusion is only scarcely analysed [57]. The receptor molecule HVEM is by its normal
ligand capable of inducing activation of nuclear factor κB
(NF-κB) and activation of T cells. By interaction with HSVgD these receptor responses are inhibited. Thus, the HSV
interaction with at least one of its receptors has multiple
potentials for modulation of the host response to the
infection [58,59].
Replication and formation of progeny virus
Upon fusion, the HSV nucleocapsid is transported by
microtubules to a nuclear membrane pore where the viral
DNA is released into the nucleus [60,61]. Both viral tegument products and cellular kinases are responsible for the
initiation of α-gene transcription [62]. In these initial
events the determination of whether it will lead to a lytic
infection cycle or a latent infection seems to be directed
largely by the infected cell type in question [63,64]. A key
event in this seems to be early induction of latency-associated transcripts (LATs) with sequences antisense to the
infected cell protein null (ICP0) and ICP4 [65-67]. In the

initial phase of the lytic replication cycle, the IE-gene
products, besides being transcription factors for the next
wave of viral proteins, intimately regulate cellular functions in favour of viral replication and immune evasion
[33,68]. Of these, the ICP0, a promiscuous transactivator
without much DNA-binding capacity, forces the cell to a
pre-dividing state optimal for viral protein synthesis
[69,70]. Furthermore, ICP0 is active in inhibiting immune
mechanisms such as interferon production and antiviral
effects of interferons [71-73] and induces degradation of
cellular proteins, involving the proteasome [74,75].
Very early in infection, the first transcriptional activity is
seen just inside the nuclear membrane at the site were the
viral DNA enters the nucleus [76]. The produced ICP0 colocalizes with the promyelocytic leukaemia (PML)
nuclear bodies and initiates degradation of these, an event
which seems to be important for productive replication of
the virus [77,78]. ICP4 binds to parental viral DNA which
is juxta-localized to the PML bodies, and later, when the
bodies are degraded, replication compartments are
formed, in which also ICP27 can be found [76,79,80].
ICP27 affects the posttranscriptional polyadenylation and
splicing of RNA, and it is thus an element of the delayed
host protein shutoff [81]. Immune evasion is additionally
induced by the IE protein ICP47 which binds to transporter associated with antigen processing, TAP1/TAP2
and blocks the presentation of viral peptides by the major
histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I [82].
The HSV progeny is formed in the nucleus of the infected
cell, where the viral DNA is packed into preformed capsids. These are assembled with the tegument proteins and
bud through the inner nuclear membrane to the perinuclear space [11]. The route of virus from here to the external side of the cell is controversial. Apparently two routes
of viral egress are possible [11]. One way is by continuous
passage through vesicles and the Golgi apparatus, where
the membrane proteins are modified. The other route is
by fusion of the newly acquired envelope with the outer
nuclear membrane or the membrane of a vesicle, generating naked nucleocapsids in the cytoplasm. From here a
new budding event should take place, for instance into the
Golgi apparatus. The progeny virus thus acquires the envelope from other membranes, than the inner nuclear
lamella, as it is indicated by analysis of membrane lipids
[83]. Increasing evidence is pointing at this latter possibility of de-envelopment and re-envelopment as the dominating route of HSV egress [84-86].
The progress of HSV infection in tissues is influenced by
the capacity of HSV to infect adjacent cells directly
through cell junctions. The virus is thus avoiding exposure
to extracellular substances such as antibodies and complement. The glycoproteins gE and gI are crucial for this kind

of polarised transmission which primarily takes place in
epithelial infections [47,87].
Epidemiology
As it is the case at the molecular level, the two herpes simplex viruses show similarities in their clinical appearance,
both giving rise to primary infections of mucosal membranes and showing latency in sensory nerve ganglia [1].
The primary infections with HSV are often asymptomatic,
especially at young age, but in a minority of cases vesicular
or ulcerative lesions are seen. Although HSV-1 and -2 can
give rise to indistinguishable clinical infections, there are
differences in the anatomical distribution of these infections, as described in 1967 by Dowdle et al. [88]. HSV-1 is
predominantly giving rise to infections above the waist,
and HSV-2 to infections below the waist. This pattern is,
however, not as straightforward as primarily described. In
the last decades changes in both prevalence and distribution of HSV infections have been seen. The overall prevalence of HSV infection is very different in different
countries and ethnic and social populations [89-91]. A
decline in HSV prevalence has been observed in the western countries, probably because of improved socioeconomic conditions [92-94]. In parallel to the decline in
prevalence, the aetiology of herpes genitalis has changed in
several countries, presumably because of altered human
habits and conditions of life [92]. In some areas of the
world the proportion of genital infections caused by HSV1 is still low (4–20 %) [95,96], but in others the relative
proportion of genital herpes caused by HSV-1 is increasing [97,98]. In Norway, approximately half of primary
genital HSV infections are caused by the type 1 virus [99],
and in young women in Edinburgh, Scotland, 60% of new
cases are caused by HSV-1 [100]. This shift of aetiology is
probably caused by changes in sexual behaviour, especially oral-genital contact [101,102], and by the decreased
prevalence of HSV-1 seropositivity at sexual debut, leaving
a larger proportion of young adults permissive for a HSV
type 1 infection [99]. Seropositivity to HSV-1 does not
render any protection against catching an infection with
HSV-2 [92,103,104], but a higher proportion of primary
genital HSV-2 infections are asymptomatic in HSV-1 seropositive individuals than in seronegative individuals
[103].

The aetiology of a genital infection is not insignificant, in
that the frequency of recurrence is higher in HSV type 2infected individuals than in those infected with type 1
[89,95]. The frequency of primary and recurrent infections with both HSV-1 and -2 has been reported to be
higher among women than men [97,103,105]. Overall,
these epidemiological changes could have implications
for the risk of neonatal infection from vaginal delivery, in
that more women are seronegative at delivery and thus a
higher number have the risk of caching a primary HSV

infection. On the other hand, less HSV is circulating,
reducing the risk of those who are susceptible.
Clinical appearance and pathogenesis
As described above, primary infection with HSV is most
often asymptomatic, especially in younger children [106].
However, some individuals experience a symptomatic primary infection with vesicular herpetic gingivostomatitis
or in adolescence more often a pharyngitis [107]. As it is
the case with orofacial infections, a primary genital HSV
infection can be both asymptomatic and symptomatic
with ulcerative lesions and with or without generalized
symptoms such as fever, headache etc. [108,109]. Rarely,
the infection disseminates to one or several organs giving
rise to infections such as necrotising hepatitis, meningitis,
encephalitis or to disseminated intravascular coagulopathy [110-113]. Such a clinical course, although uncommon, is most often seen in immunosuppressed patients
e.g. transplant patients, neonates or pregnant women
[114-116]. In pregnancy, primary infection with HSV
without previous seroconversion at the time of delivery
seems to be the main risk factor for infection of the newborn [109,117]. Genital HSV reactivations at labour only
seem to posses a minor risk for neonatal infection of the
baby [117,118], but in spite of this, approximately 70% of
neonates infected are born by asymptomatic women [63].
The amount of virus in vaginal secretions during reactivations is much lower than the amount of virus in primary
infections, and in reactivated cases maternal antibodies
furthermore seems to be protective for the neonate
[117,119-122].

When transmitted, the course of HSV infection in the
newborn varies. In the pre-acyclovir era about one third of
cases were mucocutaneus infections only involving the
skin, mouth and eyes, one third were infections of the central nervous system (CNS) with or without mucocutaneus
involvement, and the last third were disseminated infections involving multiple organs, including the liver, lungs,
adrenals, and often the CNS [119]. Of these, neonates
with a generalized infection had a one-year mortality of
approximately 60%, those with CNS-infections had
intermediary mortality, and nearly no mortality was seen
in the group of patients with only mucocutaneus involvement [119]. In infected with multi-organ involvement the
deaths are often set off by infection of liver or lungs or by
coagulopathy. Sequelae, such as mental or neurological
disabilities are seen in some of those with CNS involvement [123].
Now a day, after initiation of high-dose acyclovir treatment, the mortality and sequela rates have dropped [124].
The clinical pattern of neonatal HSV infections has
changed in that less of the mucocutaneus infections disseminate to generalized infections when treated [123].

http://www.virologyj.com/content/2/1/59

Even with high-dose acyclovir, improvements in treatment protocols are still needed, because the mortality is
still as high as 30% in disseminated infections. Reduction
in the time from debut of symptoms to initiation of therapy is vital and passive immunotherapy with HSV-specific
antibodies could posses a potential as adjuvant to the
antiviral treatment [123,125,126]. Other adjuvant treatment modalities are still needed in both neonatal infections and in generalized infections at later ages.
The pathology of HSV infections is mainly caused by a
direct cytopathic effect of the virus, resulting in cellular
lysis and focal necrosis of the infected area [119,127,128].
In tissues capable of regeneration, this is not devastating,
provided that the lesions do not totally destroy the organ
or result in functional disability during the infection. In
the brain, however, the capacity for regeneration is small,
and larger necroses induced by viral infection will result in
life-long sequelae [119,123]. A delicate balance exists
between the direct HSV-induced pathology and the
immunopathology induced by immune reactions to the
virus and the toxic and functional side effects of these
reactions [129]. Immunopathogenesis seems to be the
main aspect of HSV stromal keratitis, which often leads to
blindness [130,131]. The scarification from this infection
has even been attributed to autoimmunity by molecular
mimicry [132]. Weak immune response to the virus leads
to severe infections because of massive viral replication
and dissemination. An immense immune reaction, especially with high amounts of virus to trigger a response, can
bring about increased symptoms of infection, local symptoms such as high intra-cerebral pressure or pulmonary
complications, as well as generalized or septic symptoms
[129,133-136].
It is thus clear that early control of HSV replication in the
initial phases of infection is crucial for the host. Early containment or at least inhibition of viral replication can prevent dissemination of the infection, and the early nonspecific immune reactions thus have the potential to
inhibit development of a symptomatic infection. Obviously the host will benefit from an attenuated or asymptomatic course of infection, but HSV – with the potential
of subsequent reactivation from a latent site – could also
benefit from such a course of infection, in that the host
will survive and the activity of the host in society will not
be hampered by symptoms from infection. Thus, the HSV
has excellent chances to reach new susceptible hosts
which bring the virus and the host in a situation of mutual
benefit [33].
Macrophages
Macrophages are ubiquitous cells of the mononuclear
phagocyte system found throughout the body. Many
attempts have been made to classify this range of cells

Page 5 of 30

Virology Journal 2005, 2:59

with phagocytic activity. In 1892 Metchnikoff named
them macrophages (large eaters) in contrast to microphages (the polymorphonuclear leukocytes)[137], and in
1924 Aschoff defined the reticuloendothelial system by
the criteria of uptake of vital dye [138]. The macrophages
are now more precisely defined as an important member
of the mononuclear phagocyte system, defined in 1969 by
van Furth and colleagues [139]. In the tissues they constitute a dynamic pool of cells with many functional capabilities, among which the capacity of phagocytosis,
microbial killing, motility, and adherence to surfaces are
classic [139].
The macrophages originate from the bone marrow, where
proliferating promonocytes give rise to monocytes which
enter the blood stream [140]. After a mean circulation
time of approximately 11/2 day, the blood monocytes
migrate to the tissues [140]. In the tissues the monocytes
differentiate into macrophages with characteristics determined by the environment of the tissue in question [141].
The tissue macrophages in the major organs are represented by Kupffer cells in the liver, alveolar and interstitial
lung macrophages, spleenic and sinusoidal lymph node
macrophages, microglia in the brain, osteoclasts in bone,
and Langerhans cells of the skin. Thus, macrophages are
strategically situated all over the body taking care of debris
from the organism itself and foreign material, among others invading microorganisms, including viruses
[142,143]. Macrophages in different organs have different
characteristics and functional capabilities and can not
totally substitute one another in studies on macrophages
[141,144-147]. Likewise, macrophages from different species can possess differences in their functional capability,
e.g. the capacity for nitric oxide (NO) production
[148,149].
Macrophages in tissues are, as described above, in part
originating directly from monocytes, but they are also in
part originating from local proliferation. This local proliferation in the tissues is performed by newly recruited
monocytes, and in the steady state situation they only
constitute a small fraction of the mononuclear phagocytes
present [150]. Of the monocytes produced in the bone
marrow of mice and passing through the blood, approximately half are targeting the liver, 15 % are going to the
lungs, 25 % to the spleen and 7 % to the peritoneal cavity
[150-152]. In the lungs, 70% of tissue macrophages in the
steady-state originate from monocyte influx and 30%
from local proliferation [153]. This proportion might vary
between different tissues, as the lifespan of tissue macrophages in different organs also varies from around 6 days
in mouse spleen to approximately one month for alveolar
macrophages [151,152]. In the skin, Langerhans cells are
a very stable and long-lived population of cells staying
there for at least 18 month in the steady-state situation.

http://www.virologyj.com/content/2/1/59

However, in inflammation the Langerhans cells are within
2 weeks replaced and supplemented by circulating mononuclear cells [154]. When an inflammatory process is initiated, the dynamics of monocytes and macrophages are
changed. Monocytes and other white blood cells are produced and recruited from the bone marrow, and the white
blood cell count in the circulation is increased. The monocytes are mainly passing through the blood to become tissue macrophages, and the number of macrophages in the
inflamed tissue can be increased by more than ten times
[155]. In inflamed tissue the local proliferation of macrophages does not seem to increase, although the number of
newly recruited cells is high, indicating that the differentiation of monocytes in the tissues is accelerated [155].
The differentiation of monocytes and activation of macrophages have been a focus of interest for many years
because of the observation that macrophage activation is
crucial in the defence against many intracellular pathogens [156-159]. It became clear relatively early that lymphocytes and soluble factors secreted by these
(lymphokines) are important in activation of macrophages for killing of intracellular bacteria, e.g. Listeria
[160]. In the killing of bacteria, interferon (IFN)-γ was
shown to be an important stimulator of macrophage activation [161]. As mechanisms in performance of the killing simple toxic substances of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) and nitric oxide were identified and seem to conduct their action in synergy [162-164]. The toxic substances are chemically simple, but their production and
regulation in macrophages are very complex and still a
matter of intense studies [149].
The state of the activated macrophage has changed conceptually from being viewed as one specific condition of
the cell towards a more dynamic picture, provoked by the
fact that macrophages activated by different means show
different phenotypical characteristics [163,165]. The activated macrophage is now viewed as a cell with floating
characteristics of many functional capacities regulated by
a multitude of stimulating substances, such as the
cytokine environment, hormones, and pathogenic and
foreign substances [147,166]. Among variables, controlling macrophage activity in infected individuals, are the
genetic constitutions of the host. The genetic background
has been shown to be of importance for the regulation of
both basic proliferation and function of macrophages and
for the more specific antimicrobial responses [167,168].
Cytokines
Soluble mediators of lymphocyte activities were described
as early as 1953, but the first lymphokines/cytokines
found and characterized were the type I interferons. Soon
after, many other soluble mediators of lymphocyte and
monocyte/macrophage activities were found [169-171].

Virology Journal 2005, 2:59

The term lymphokine was introduced by Dumonde et al.
in 1969, to describe lymphocyte derived factors, and the
term monokine was used as a description of factors coming from the mononuclear phagocyte system, both acting
on many cells, primarily leukocytes [172]. Because of a
broader view on origin and function of these factors, the
term cytokine is now more often used. Each cytokine was
originally named according to biological activity in a
functional assay, which often gave several different names
to one cytokine, and thus confusion at the molecular
level. To straighten this out, a numerical nomenclature of
interleukins (between leukocytes) was introduced in 1979
[173]. This numbering system has clarified the field, but
since it has no mnemonic functional anchorage it has
drawn critique since then [174-176].
The cytokines are generally smaller proteins, some composed of two subunits, utilizing specific receptors on target cells for induction of their functional effects. They are
structurally related in three families, with the prototypes
being IL-1, IL-2 and IL-17 [176]. Functionally, cytokines
are highly potent regulatory proteins acting in a paracrine
or autocrine manner at picomolar concentrations [177].
The cytokine receptors are also structurally clustered in
families, and functionally utilize a battery of overlapping
kinases and nuclear binding proteins in their signalling
pathway and thus have overlapping functions [178]. The
final functional capacity of the effector cell thus reflects
the cytokine environment experienced by the cell [177].
Thus the cytokines comprise a network of factors inducing
or inhibiting each others secretion and function in different cells, giving rise to a constantly floating landscape of a
large array of functional capacities [177]. In the early
hours of a viral infection, the cytokines produced by cells
infected or coming into contact with viral products are
vital in conduction of the innate immune response to the
infection [168,179].
Interferons
The interferons (IFNs) were described and named in 1957
by Isaacs and Lindenmann [170], who characterized the
substances involved in the previously described
interference of one virus with the replication of another
unrelated virus, and the interfering activity of inactivated
influenza virus with the subsequent infection of chorioallantoic membranes [180-182]. The IFNs were the first
cytokines described in detail, and thus provided the fundamental basis for the understanding of the cytokine concept [183]. The IFNs are divided into three major groups.
The two original groups of IFNs are designated type I and
type II, type I being the so called non-immune IFN, and
type II the immune IFN. Type II (IFN-γ) is produced in
high amounts as part of a specific immune reaction,
whereas the type I IFNs can be produced by many cell
types in response to, in immunological terms, non-spe-

cific stimulation. The many functions of IFNs and the
growing understanding of signalling and regulation indicate that IFN analogues may play a major role in the next
generation of new antiviral compounds [171].
The type I IFNs are a diverse group of cytokines, consisting
of IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-ε, IFN-κ, IFN-ω, IFN-δ, IFN-τ, and
IFN-ξ/limitin [171,184]. The first five of these are
expressed in humans, and their relative production
depends on the stimulus and the cell type in question. The
IFN-α family consists of multiple species and some of
these in different allelic forms in both humans and mice.
In humans 13 IFN-α genes and one pseudogene and in
mice 14 IFN-α genes and 3 pseudogenes have been identified, clustering on chromosome 4 in mouse and chromosome 9 in man [185]. The functional importance of
such a diversity is largely unknown. The subtypes differ in
potency and have previously been shown to vary in their
profile of activities [186,187], but new studies show correlation between antiproliferative and antiviral effects of
various IFN-α species [185]. Thus, it seems that the importance of the diversity could come from varying expression
patterns of the different IFN-α species. Most of the α IFNs
are N-glycosylated, but glycosylation does not correlate
with activity of the molecule, but rather with in vivo stability, and recombinant IFNs are shown to have activity comparable with that of the naturally produced molecules
[185,188]. Only one IFN-β species exists, coded by a gene
situated in the IFN type I cluster on chromosome 4 in
mouse and chromosome 9 in man, as described above
[185].
The natural IFN-α and -β have a molecular weight of 19 –
26 kDa and most species retain stability at pH 2 [189]. All
type I IFNs bind to one common receptor composed of
two subunits, IFN-α-receptor(R)1 and IFN-αR2. The IFNα/β receptor (IFNAR) signal through the JAK/STAT-pathway by phosphorylation of the Janus kinase (JAK)1, tyrosine kinase (Tyk)2, signal transducer and activator of
transcription (STAT)1 and STAT2, and induces genes with
an IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) in their promoter [171,190].
Generally the type I IFNs exhibit a huge range of biological effects, such as antiviral and antiproliferative effects,
stimulation of immune cells such as T cells, natural killer
(NK) cells, monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells,
increased expression of MHC-I, activation of pro-apoptotic genes and inhibition of anti-apoptotic mechanisms,
modulation of cellular differentiation, and inhibition of
angiogenesis [171]. The newly discovered IFN-ξ/limitin
also interacts with the IFN-α/β receptor, and is regarded as
a type I IFN [184,191]. Antiviral activity of IFN-ξ has been
shown against many viruses including HSV, and it exhibits both immunomodulatory and anti-tumour effects, but

the lymphosuppressive activity is less than that of IFN-α
[184,192]. A human homolog of IFN-ξ could thus have
interesting potential in the therapy of tumours and viral
infections.
The type II IFN is represented by only one member, the
IFN-γ [193]. Structurally, IFN-γ is distinct from the type I
IFNs, and it signals through a different receptor. For many
years IFN-γ was thought only to be expressed by T cells.
Later the large granular lymphocytes (NK cells) were recognised as important producers by the fact that Ia-antigen
(MHC-II) expression on mouse macrophages could be
induced by Listeria monocytogenes infection in SCID mice
lacking T cells [194-196]. In recent years it has, however,
been clear that other cell types, originally thought not to
be producers of IFN-γ, are in fact capable of IFN-γ expression. So now macrophages, B cells, NKT cells and professional antigen-presenting cells are also recognized as IFNγ producers in certain situations [197-202]. Induction and
production of IFN-γ in antigen-presenting cells and NK
cells seem to be vital in the early non-specific response to
infections and of importance in the linkage to the adaptive specific responses coming up later [202-204]. The
induction of IFN-γ production in non-T cells (e.g. NK
cells) is conducted by cytokines, especially IL-12 in synergy with other proinflammatory cytokines, largely produced by mononuclear phagocytes [205,206].

http://www.virologyj.com/content/2/1/59

phages, antigen-presenting cells, and NK cells and inhibition of T-helper type 2 (Th2) cells, resulting in a Th1driven cell-mediated response to infection [204]. Experiments in knock out (KO) mice with deficient IFN-γ,
IFNGR, or STAT1 expression have shown that this system
is of major importance, but not vital, in the host response
to viral infections [216-219].
Besides the two traditional groups of IFNs, a new group of
IFN-like cytokines has been described in various species
and named IL-28A (IFN-λ2), IL-28B (IFN-λ3), and IL-29
(IFN-λ1) [171,220]. These cytokines are antiviral proteins
interacting with a distinct heterodimeric class II cytokine
receptor composed of IFN-λR1 and IL-10R2, but sharing
with the type I IFNs some intracellular signalling pathways through the ISRE [221]. Thus, they have a largely
similar antiviral effect as the type I IFNs [220].

IFN-γ exerts its effects through a distinct class II cytokine
receptor, the IFN-γ receptor (IFNGR), composed of two
subunits, IFN-γR1 and IFN-γR2. Upon binding of a
homodimer of IFN-γ to the receptor complex, JAK2 autophosphorylates and then transphosphorylates JAK1. Activated JAK1 in turn phosphorylates IFN-γR1, which allows
binding of the STAT1 homodimer to the receptor and subsequent phosphorylation of STAT1 [204]. The IFNGR and
STAT1 are preformed as hetero- and homo-dimers, and
upon receptor binding, the IFN-γ-IFN-γR1-STAT1 complex seems to be internalized and translocated to the
nucleus, where the activated STAT1 homodimer binds to
DNA at GAS elements and induces the first wave of
responses [204,207-211]. Many of these initial IFN-γ
induced products are transcription factors participating in
further regulation of the many IFN-induced cellular
response. Among these products are the IFN regulatory
factors (IRFs) which stimulate or inhibit transcription of
genes possessing an ISRE in the promoter region
[204,212].

Tumour necrosis factor
Tumour necrosis factor (TNF, former designated TNF-α)
and lymphotoxin (LT; former TNF-β) were for many years
also known as cachectin from their involvement in
cachexia of cancer patients [222]. TNF is a prototype and
the second member of the TNF ligand superfamily
(TNFSF2), now encompassing over 40 known signalling
molecules, among which the LTα, LTβ, and LIGHT (LTlike, exhibits inducible expression, and competes with
HSV glycoprotein D for HVEM, a receptor expressed by T
lymphocytes) are some of the more prominent ligands
[58,223]. Each member is the ligand of one or two distinct
receptors of the TNF receptor family sharing a high degree
of homology. The current nomenclature of these ligands
and receptors has now been gathered on the internet
[224]. TNF is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein coded
from the human chromosome 6 and from chromosome
17 in mice [223]. It is synthesized as a 26 kDa transmembrane pro-TNF, primarily located in the membranes of the
Golgi apparatus [225]. The pro-TNF is cleaved by a metalloprotease releasing the 17 kDa extracellular portion of
the molecule [222,226]. Production and release of TNF
from the cell is regulated at both the transcriptional and
translational level and by post translational modification
as described above [227]. During HSV infection both preand post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms are
involved in TNF production [228]. TNF is produced by
many cell types of immune origin, primarily mononuclear phagocytes, neutrophils, NK cells and T cells, and
has diverse effects on different cells [222].

For many years the key mediator of macrophage activation during antigen-induced processes was recognised as
macrophage activating factor (MAF) [213]. Only later, the
crucial importance of these effects was attributed to IFN-γ
[214,215]. IFN-γ has antiviral activity, but the most
important effects of IFN-γ seem to be activation of macro-

Both membrane bound and soluble TNF interact as
homotrimers with two different receptors, the p55 TNFR1
(TNFRSF1A) and the p75 TNFR2 (TNFRSF1B) [222]. As
most other receptors of this family, TNFR1 holds a death
domain important in the pro-apoptotic pathway. TNFR1
is expressed virtually on every cell type except

Page 8 of 30

Virology Journal 2005, 2:59

erythrocytes, whereas TNFR2 is mostly expressed on
endothelial and bone marrow derived cells [227]. The
TNFR2 activates NF-κB (p50, p65/RelA, and p52/RelB) by
ubiquitin-mediated degradation of inhibitor-κB (IκB)
after phosphorylation by an IκB kinase (IKK). Besides
inducing apoptosis, TNFR1 also activates NF-κB (p50/
p65) [229,230]. Furthermore, the activator protein 1 (AP1) is activated by mitogen-activated protein kinases
(MAPKs) and together with NF-κB primarily acts in the
proinflammatory pathways. Thus, signalling from the
TNF receptor family induces a delicate balance between
life and death (apoptosis) of the cell. Both of the TNF
receptors can by proteolytic cleavage be converted to soluble receptors with the capacity to compete with their signalling ancestors, but also act to stabilize the trimeric TNF
and thus maintain its activity [227,231].
The TNF superfamily seems to have evolved with the
adaptive immune system in vertebrates and is crucial for
the embryonic development of lymphoid tissue [223].
Furthermore, TNF is, as a proinflammatory cytokine,
involved in activation of many immune cells and is thus
an important factor of both the early non-specific and the
specific immune response [232]. The importance of the
TNF superfamily in antiviral defence is illustrated by the
fact that different viruses have developed mechanisms for
interference with nearly every step of activity of this system [227,229].
Interleukin-12, IL-23 and IL-27
IL-12 is the prime member of a small group of heterodimeric cytokines, all with the capacity to induce production of IFN-γ in a variety of cells. IL-12 was first
described as an NK cell stimulatory factor (NKSF) and
identified as a heterodimeric molecule composed of a p40
and a p35 subunit, which are covalently linked [233]. The
p35 subunit has homologies to IL-6, and p40 is homologous to the extracellular domain of the haematopoietin
receptor family, particularly the IL-6Rα chain [234]. The
two IL-12 subunits are coded from different chromosomes, i.e. the human chromosomes 3 and 5 and the
mouse chromosomes 6 and 11, respectively [235]. These
genes are regulated separately, and coordinated induction
in the same cell is required for secretion of the biologically
active IL-12p70 heterodimer [236]. IL-12 is produced by
monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils and
B cells [235,237]. In the initial response of spleen cells in
mice injected in vivo with extracts of toxoplasma gondii or
with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the cellular source was
found to be dendritic cells, but cultured macrophages
have by themselves also been shown to produce IL-12p40
upon HSV-2 infection [238,239]. Such differences could
depend on variations in the signalling mechanisms
involved, which is also illustrated by the observation that
the production in dendritic cells and macrophages has dif-

http://www.virologyj.com/content/2/1/59

ferent kinetics. This difference could be brought about by
differences in the requirement for co-stimulation with
IFN-γ [240]. A collaborative action of dendritic cells and
macrophages could be important, as indicated for IL-12
induction by influenza virus and other inducers [241].
The receptor for IL-12 is found on NK cells, T cells and
dendritic cells and consists of two subunits (β1 and β2),
which signal by the β2 subunit through the JAK/STAT
pathway, primarily by activated STAT4 [235]. The primary
effect of IL-12 is induction of IFN-γ production in NK cells
and T cells, and IL-12 activates the cytotoxic potential of
these cells. The IFN-γ locus in NK cells is constitutively
demethylated and is thus ready for transcription of the
gene, which is in contrast to that of T cells, [242]. Macrophages and NK cells are then stimulated by IFN-γ, resulting in activation for enhanced antimicrobial capacity
[243,244]. IL-12 and IFN-γ in conjunction are the main
responsible factors for activation of a Th1-driven adaptive
cellular immune response, important for the long-term
control of intracellular pathogens [235]. IL-12 stimulates
proliferation of naïve T cells, and in conjunction with IFNγ inhibits Th2 cell differentiation and the production of
Th2 cytokines (e.g. IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13) [235]. Thus IL-12
holds a key position in induction and control of the Th1
response. The IL-12-induced IFN-γ production is synergistically enhanced by other cytokines such as TNF and IL-1
[240], and IFN-γ production can even be induced in macrophages by co-stimulation with IL-18 [197,245,246], a
cytokine which by itself does not possess major IFN-γinducing capacity [240]. A positive feed-back loop is initiated by the IL-12-induced production of IFN-γ, in that
IFN-γ is an important primer of IL-12 production, thus
accelerating the system [247]. Furthermore, T cells
enhance IL-12 production through signals of the proinflammatory TNF family [240]. In virus-infected macrophages a similar autocrine feed-back loop involving IL-12,
IL-18, IFN-α/β, and IFN-γ could be speculated [248].
This potentially harmful situation, with accelerating IFNγ production, regulated in a positive feed-back loop by IL12, is inhibited by cytokines possessing anti-inflammatory properties. Among these IL-10 holds a crucial position as an inhibitor of IL-12 production, an effect which is
also conducted by transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)
[249-251].The Th2 cytokines of the other side of the adaptive response, IL-4 and IL-13, inhibit IL-12 induction in
the early phases of stimulation, but later they can be
potent inducers of IL-12 production, although they still
inhibit many of the IFN-γ-induced activities
[212,252,253]. Phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by macrophages inhibits production of IL-12, a regulatory mechanism which seems to be important in restriction of the
damages induced by uncontrolled defence mechanisms
[254]. Injection of high doses of IL-12 to virus-infected

mice is toxic, and leads to death with the pathology of
TNF-related toxic shock, an effect which was explained by
increased sensitivity to the toxic effects of TNF, and found
to be dependent on the genetic constitution of the host
[255,256].
The small IL-12 cytokine family also includes two other
heterodimeric cytokines, IL-23 and IL-27, and a
homodimer of IL-12p40. The latter is found in vivo in
mice and functions as an antagonist of IL-12, but it is
debated whether it exists in humans [257,258]. IL-23 is
composed of the IL-12p40 and a p19 subunit and likewise
binds to a receptor with one of the IL-12 receptor subunits
(IL-12Rβ1) and a distinct IL-23R subunit [240,259]. The
production and function of IL-23 is quite similar to that
of IL-12, but IL-23 has a unique capacity to induce proliferation of memory T cells [235], and it has been found in
nervous ganglia of HSV-infected mice on day 3 of infection [260]. IL-23 drives IL-17 production of NK cells,
which mobilizes neutrophils and promotes production of
the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6, and TNF [261].
IL-27 is the newest recognized member of the family, constructed of two distinct subunits (EBI3 and p28), but still
with functional capacities alike those of IL-12 [262]. The
functional implications of these later discovered members
of the IL-12 family is not yet clear, but it seems as if they
are contributors to the overall effects of the IL-12 family
and fine-tune the system [235,263-266]. The induction of
IFN-γ and activation of NK cells is not only mastered by
members of the IL-12 cytokine family. Other cytokines,
like IL-15, are also implicated in development, function,
and activation of these cells [267,268]. Generally, the IL12 cytokine family has shown itself of importance in early
defence against several viral infections, and as a vital
inducer and regulator of the adaptive immune response
against viruses and other intracellular pathogens
[219,256,261,269].

http://www.virologyj.com/content/2/1/59

enzymes in these reactions, the NADPH oxidase and the
inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) [271-273].
The primary producer cells of IL-4 and IL-13 are the Th2
cells, but these cytokines are also produced by basophils
and mast cells [274-276]. The receptors for IL-4 and IL-13
are expressed on most cells and are composed as dimers
of four different chains. IL-4 is the ligand of two receptors:
A high-affinity heterodimer of IL-4Rα and the IL-2R common γ-chain and another heterodimeric receptor composed of IL-4Rα and IL-13Rα1. IL-13 binds to three
complexes: A high-affinity heterodimer of IL-13Rα and IL4Rα and two homodimers composed of either IL-13Rα1
or IL-13Rα2, which are both coded from genes on the
human X-chromosome [276]. The immunomodulatory
signalling is conducted through the JAK/STAT-pathway
utilizing JAK1, JAK3 and STAT6. Phosphorylated and
homodimerized STAT6 binds to STAT binding elements
(SBE), which includes GAS, and either trans-activates or
inhibits transcription of the adjacent genes [212]. The
functions of IL-4 and IL-13 are nearly overlapping with
only discreet discrepancies [276,277].
IL-4 was discovered in 1982 on the basis of another
important effect of the cytokine, namely the ability to
induce proliferation of B cells, and it was from this effect
in the early years called B cell growth factor [278]. As this,
some other effects of IL-4 are stimulating, in that it furthermore activates other Th2-like effects such as B cell
class-switching and expression of mannose receptor and
Fc receptor for IgE on macrophages [276]. Despite the
anti-inflammatory profile IL-4 has in vivo been shown to
confer some resistance to HSV infection [279,280]. IL-4 is
thus not only an inhibiting cytokine but essentially an
immunomodulatory cytokine with regulatory effects on
macrophages as well.

The armament and early strikes
Interleukin-4 and IL-13
Upon an accelerating pro-inflammatory response induced
by initial viral replication the organism has to embank the
IFN-γ-activated potentially harmful actions of macrophages and NK cells. Important mediators of this
embankment are IL-4 and IL-13, which as described above
repress the induction of IL-12, and thus put a brake on the
positive feed-back loop of IFN-γ production [249,252].
Furthermore, IL-4 suppresses the production of other proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL-1 [270]. Most
importantly, IL-4 and IL-13 are potent inhibitors of the
efferent arm of the pro-inflammatory system, and thus
inhibit production of reactive oxygen species and nitric
oxide. The production of these two potentially harmful
effector mechanisms of activated macrophages is hampered by inhibition of production of the responsible

The early innate defence mechanisms have for many years
been regarded as important for the course of many viral
infections, including infections with HSV [281]. The control of viral replication and dissemination during the first
days of an HSV infection seems to be vital for the final
outcome. If the viral replication is not halted by natural
defence mechanisms during induction and maturation of
the antigen-specific immune response, the adaptive
immune system can be overwhelmed by massive viral
infection at the dawn of activity of the specific reactions.
The mechanisms of the anti-herpetic natural defence have
been analysed extensively. It became relatively early clear
that antiviral activity of macrophages [281] and NK cells
[282] and early activity of the IFN-system [283] were
important mediators of innate resistance to HSV. The relative contribution of each of these players in the early
defence has been much debated, and as more interactions

and molecular mechanisms are now elucidated, it seems
clear that all of these players each hold a crucial position
in an integrated antiviral natural defence system.
Early induction of IFN-α/β by HSV
An important model used in the study of resistance mechanisms in defence against generalized infection with HSV
is a mouse model, where mice infected intra-peritoneally
or intra-venously experience a generalized infection with
HSV replication in most organs, including the liver,
spleen, and eventually the brain [284]. The dissemination
of infection to the brain and the severity of infection of the
peripheral organs depend in part on the age of the mice,
as is the case in humans, where neonates have difficulties
in controlling a HSV infection [281,285-287]. The course
of infection in mice also depends on the type of HSV in
question. Furthermore, in 1975 Lopez described a differential susceptibility of inbred mice to generalized infection with HSV, and this genetic difference in sensitivity
has since been used for analysis of resistance factors of
importance for the anti-herpetic defence [288]. In generalized infections, the genetics of the relative resistance to
HSV-2 was shown to segregate with the X-chromosome
[289]. This pattern of resistance to the generalized infection was for both HSV-1 and -2 attributed to a genetically
determined difference in the capacity for IFN-α/β production [179,290,291], and it was shown that the X-linked
pattern of resistance segregated with the HSV-2-induced
production of IFN-α/β in macrophages during the first
hours of infection [168]. Furthermore, macrophages from
female mice respond to HSV with higher IFN-α/β production than macrophages from male mice [168]. This observation is in line with female mice being more resistant to
HSV infection in vivo [291].

Early production of IFN-α/β has been correlated to resistance of HSV infections in several other studies. Treatment
of mice with antibodies to IFN-α/β increases and accelerates mortality of a generalized HSV-1 infection and with
higher doses of virus, mice are dying already after three to
four days, a period where antigen-specific mechanisms are
still in the induction and proliferation phase [292]. Furthermore, mice treated with mercuric chloride showed
higher titres of HSV-2 in the first days of infection, an
effect which could be correlated to impaired production
of IFN-α/β [293,294]. In studies on peripheral HSV infections, such as cutaneous or corneal infections, IFN-α/β
has been shown to be produced locally and to restrict the
local replication of HSV and infection of nervous ganglia
cells of the area, an effect which has also been correlated
to the genetic constitution of the host [295-298].
The genetic background for the X-linked trait of HSV
resistance and IFN-α/β production of macrophages
remains unravelled. Induction of IFN-α/β upon HSV

http://www.virologyj.com/content/2/1/59

infection seems to be governed by different mechanisms
in different cells [299]. IFN-α/β can be induced early by
both infectious and UV-inactivated HSV in various cells,
with the infectious virus being the more potent inducer in
mouse peritoneal macrophages, whereas the UV-inactivated virus showed most potency in human peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) [168,299-302]. Production of IFN-α/β was induced by gD of HSV-1 in PBMC, but
not in murine macrophages [17,303,304]. In PBMCderived dendritic cells, however, the cellular mannose
receptor was shown to be involved [299,305]. Furthermore, different Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have been
shown to react with HSV [306]. TLRs are transmembrane
pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that detect redundant microbial molecular motives and induce antiviral
and proinflammatory cytokines in response to alerting
signals. In dendritic cells, TLR9-signalling, induced by the
GC-rich HSV genome, has been shown to govern the
induction of IFN-α/β, but TLR9-KO mice are still capable
of controlling HSV infections in vivo [307-309]. However,
in mouse macrophages the TLRs do not seem to be crucial
for IFN-α/β induction upon HSV infection [304]. This is
in agreement with the observation that the majority of
IFN-α/β produced by spleen cells and dendritic cells and
the total production from bone marrow macrophages was
independent of TLR9 or MyD88, which is necessary for
signalling by most TLRs [308]. In this study, heat inactivated virus was shown still to induce IFN-α/β in cells utilizing TLR9. As resident peritoneal macrophages do not
produce IFN-α/β in response to even high doses of heat
inactivated HSV, this gives an additional indication of
independency from TLR9 of IFN-α/β production in macrophages [300]. Moreover, efficient induction of IFN-α/β
by HSV in macrophages required dsRNA-activated protein
kinase (PKR) activity and infectivity of the virus [304].
This is in agreement with the observation that dsRNA,
which is produced by most viruses during replication,
induces IFN through PKR, and not through TLR3, which
also binds dsRNA [310]. Furthermore, another mechanism of IFN induction by dsRNA through a RNA helicase
has been proposed [311].
The different induction patterns in different cells types,
and the fact that IFN-α/β seems largely to be induced by
other mechanisms than TLRs, explain the fact that knocking out TLR-signalling by MyD88 did not influence the in
vivo infection with HSV in mice [309]. Other TLRs have
also been shown to mediate signals in HSV infections. In
HSV encephalitis in TLR2-KO mice, viral replication
seemed unchanged or slightly increased during the first 4
days of infection, and the production of IL-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 were impaired, but interestingly pathological changes and mortality were reduced
[134].

First early wave of response
First early wave of response. The very early response to HSV
infection of macrophages (Mφ). During the first few hours of
infection HSV induces production of IFN-α/β and TNF in
macrophages. The implications of these cytokines for HSV
replication in neighbouring cells and for macrophage activation and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are
outlined. Stimulatory pathways are indicated by green arrows
(→), and inhibitory pathways are drawn in red.

In relation to the X-linked resistance pattern of HSV infection and IFN production upon HSV infection, it is interesting that some of the TLRs are coded from the Xchromosome [312]. These are the TLR7 and TLR8, which
are triggered by guanosine- or uridine-rich ssRNA in the
endosomal compartment of cells [313,314]. There are,
however, no indications that this pathway is implicated in
IFN induction in cells during HSV infection, but the question has still not been directly addressed.
Regulation of the IFN-α/β gene induction is in part governed by activation of the transcription factors IRF-3 and 7, which are induced by IFN-α/β itself, resulting in a positive feed back loop, an effect which has been known for
years without knowledge of the signalling mechanisms
[315-317]. Thus, one possible explanation for the genetic
differences in HSV-induced IFN-α/β production could be
an elevated physiological level of this IFN self-stimulating
system [318-321]. An analysis of the levels of IRF-3 and 7 in normal macrophages from these mice could be of
interest. Analysis of the levels of the IFN-induced enzyme
2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) in uninfected cells
showed low but slightly higher levels in cells from relatively resistant mice [322]. With LPS, cells from the relatively resistant (C57Bl/6) mice show an early induction
pattern of IFN-α/β, peaking within 2 hours, whereas cells
from the susceptible BALB/c mice demonstrate a delayed
response, peaking 7 hours after induction [323].

Among other transcription factors involved in induction
of the various IFN-α/β genes are the heterodimeric NF-κB
family, which is activated by TLRs, IL-1R, and TNFR [324].
During a HSV infection NF-κB is activated and translocated to the nucleus [325]. Many regulatory mechanisms
of NF-κB activation exist, one of them exerted through
TNF, which is produced by macrophages very early during
HSV infection (fig. 2) [293,300,325,326]. Thus, the
responsible mechanisms might be exerted by other regulatory signals, influencing the magnitude of the HSV-triggered IFN-α/β induction pathway, and perhaps not by this
pathway in itself [327].
A number of X-linked immunodeficiencies have been
described, one of them being the Wiskott-Aldrich
syndrome with defects in a protein expressed in haematopoietic cells, facilitating reorganization of the actin
cytoskeleton, and thus influencing the mobility of
immune cells and chemotaxis of macrophages. Patients
with this X-linked immunodeficiency show aggravated
herpetic infections, and cells from some patients seem to
produce lower amounts of IFN in response to HSV [328330]. Cells from patients with another X-linked immunodeficiency with mutations in the CD40-ligand, a member
of the TNF family, showed decreased IFN-α/β production
when infected with HSV-1, but these patients apparently
show a normal response to viral infections [331,332]. This
supports the notion above that other regulatory signals
might be involved.
Effect of early IFN-α/β on HSV replication
The overall effects of the IFN-α/β system, besides the production as described above, are determined by the sensitivity of cells to the secreted IFN-α/β. The effector
mechanisms of IFN-α/β on HSV replication are not fully
elucidated. Several IFN-α/β-activated systems are
involved, including the dsRNA-activated PKR, which
phosphorylates, and thereby inhibits, the elongation initiation factor (eIF)-2α, resulting in inhibition of translation [333]. Another important mediator of the antiviral
activity is the OAS system, which activates 2'-5'oligoadenylate-dependent RNase L with the capacity to degrade
single-stranded RNA [333]. Lately, the PML bodies have
been described as crucial for the anti-HSV effect of IFN-α/
β [334].

In mice exhibiting a relatively HSV-resistant phenotype,
the direct antiviral effect of IFN-α/β in embryonic cells
was found to be approximately three-fold higher than in
cells from susceptible mice [322]. Data from another
study showed comparable results on IFN-α/β sensitivity
concerning the replication of encephalomyocarditis virus
(EMCV) in cells from the same mouse strains [335]. This
phenomenon was inherited as a co-dominant autosomal
trait without any apparent influence of X-linked genes

[322,336]. Further studies in mouse fibroblasts have
revealed that TNF intensify the antiviral effect of IFN-α/β
and, thus, the in vivo situation seems more complicated
(fig. 2) [300,337]. In the original publication on genetics
of HSV susceptibility in inbred mice, Lopez reported
fibroblasts from the different mice to replicate HSV
equally, and the same was found in the cells showing differential sensitivity to IFN-α/β [288,322]. In line with
these results, the IFN-activated OAS, an inhibitor of HSV
replication, was induced to a higher degree in cells from
the resistant mice upon IFN-α/β treatment [322,333,338].
Furthermore, the level of stimulated and unstimulated
OAS was generally found to vary between different inbred
mouse strains [339]. Thus, the genetic difference in antiviral action of type I IFNs seems to affect the replication of
several different viruses and to correlate with resistance to
HSV.
The viral host protein synthesis shutoff, exerted by the
HSV vhs-protein of the tegument, has major effects on the
cytokine production of infected cells and reduces the
effect of IFN-α/β on HSV replication [340]. Furthermore,
the tegument proteins have been shown to induce cellular
inhibitors of the JAK/STAT pathway, resulting in inhibition of both IFN signalling and production [341,342]. The
IE protein ICP0 inhibits activation of IRF-3 and thereby
also restricts IFN-induced pathways [71-73], and ICP0,
ICP4 and ICP27 induce late shutoff of protein synthesis
with decreased mRNA stability and thus reduced cytokine
production [81,343]. As outlined, it thus seems HSV has
evolved several mechanisms to evade the consequences of
the IFN-α/β system, which underline the importance of
these cytokines in the antiviral defence.
Early effects of HSV on macrophage activation
During HSV infection macrophages are activated and possess an increased antiviral potential [281,344]. Classically,
the macrophage antiviral activity has been described as
intrinsic or extrinsic [345]. Resting macrophages possess a
high degree of intrinsic activity against HSV, generally
being non-permissive to viral replication. The macrophages are thus a blind end for the HSV infection, and
they can in that way protect other cells from infection, for
example as a barrier lining the liver sinusoids [344]. The
extrinsic antiviral activity refers to the ability of macrophages to inactivate virus outside the macrophage itself or
to inhibit viral replication in other cells [346]. The intrinsic antiviral activity depends among other factors on macrophage differentiation and has been correlated to IFN
activity, either physiological levels of "spontaneous" preinfection-synthesized or rapidly acting autocrine IFN-α/β
[344]. In that respect, macrophages from mice of the
resistant phenotype showed higher intrinsic activity by
being less permissive to HSV replication [281,347].

http://www.virologyj.com/content/2/1/59

One potential antiviral mechanism of macrophages may
be the production of ROS. These were originally assigned
to bacterial killing, but the effect of ROS has also been correlated to antiviral functions, although they might not be
of major importance [348]. The ROS are mainly produced
by NADPH-oxidases (Nox), which are membrane-bound
multi-component enzymes primarily situated in the
phagolysosome [349]. Activation of the NAHPD-oxidase,
by phosphorylation and fusion of the enzyme subunits,
primarily results in production of superoxide anion (O2-),
which by superoxide dismutase can be converted to
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The H2O2 in turn is then by
Fe2+ (Fenton reaction) or by Fe3+ and O2- (Haber-Weiss
reaction) converted to hydroxyl radical (·OH), hydroxyl
anion (OH-) and singlet oxygen (1O2), or by the myeloperoxidase to hypochlorous acid (HOCl) [349,350].
Small amounts of ROS are also produced by the mitochondria and may be of importance as signalling molecules from TNF [351,352].
During HSV infection in vivo, macrophages are activated
and achieve an increased capacity to react with a respiratory burst of ROS when appropriately triggered, i.e. by
phorbol esters (fig. 2) [353]. This macrophage activation
is induced early in response to HSV infection, reaching a
plateau within the first 12 hours of i.p. infection [353]. In
vitro, macrophages were shown to be the cell type
responding with an oxidative burst, and this capacity
peaked after only 8 hours of infection with HSV [353].
This HSV-induced capacity for an increased respiratory
burst was shown to be governed by autocrine IFN-α/β as
a sine qua non phenomenon [300,353]. Nevertheless, TNF
was also found to influence the macrophage activation. By
itself, TNF reduced the macrophage capacity for a respiratory burst, but in combination with IFN-α/β it synergistically enhanced the IFN-induced activation [293,300].
Interestingly, a secreted portion of the HSV-gG acts as a
phagocyte chemoattractant and induces production of
ROS by signalling through the receptor activated by the
phorbol esters [354].
The HSV-induced activation of macrophages in vivo is
influenced by the genetic constitution of the host, with
the most pronounced activation of macrophages originating from resistant mice, as expected on the basis of the
genetics of IFN-α/β production in response to the infection. Furthermore, the genetics of the efferent part of the
IFN-α/β-mediated HSV-induced activation of macrophages, displayed a co-dominant autosomal trait, as was
the case with the antiviral effect of IFN-α/β in fibroblasts
[336]. Thus, the genetically-determined sensitivity to IFNα/β seems to be expressed in different cell-types. The
influence of TNF on the genetics of this phenomenon has
not been addressed. In Contrast to these observations, the
genetics concerning the antiproliferative effect of IFN-α/β

Virology Journal 2005, 2:59

in bone marrow cells seems to be reversed [335,355]. This
might, however, be linked, in that ROS are shown to
activate various signalling molecules, mediate apoptosis,
and exhibit antiproliferative effects depending on the
dose and time of exposure [352].
Little is known on the potential antiviral effect of ROS. By
examining peroxidized lipids, which is an oxidative product from ROS in tissues, it has been documented that
these are produced during the acute HSV infection in vivo,
and speculations on antiviral mechanisms have focused
on induction of apoptosis [348,356,357]. HSV triggers
apoptosis of infected cells by several pathways, and the
importance of this phenomenon is indicated by the fact
that the virus has evolved mechanisms to counteract each
of these pathways [358]. Macrophages generally suppress
apoptosis in HSV infections, as seen by increased apoptosis in macrophage-depleted mice [359].
Several studies on the mechanisms involved in the early
battle against HSV, performed in in vivo animal models,
have pointed to IFN-α/β as a crucial player. In adoptive
transfer experiments, the effect of adult mouse spleen cells
on the initial phase of a generalized HSV infection in suckling mice was conducted by IFN-α/β [360]. Furthermore,
administration of a hematopoetic growth factor to neonatal mice increases the number of dendritic cells, B cells
and NK cells, and confers resistance in a cutaneous model
of HSV infection. The effect in this model could also
largely be attributed to the actions of IFN-α/β, with some
additional contributions by IFN-γ [361,362]. In KO-mice
IFN-α/β was able to control the initial phase of a generalized HSV infection without contributions from NK, T- or
B cells, but these latter players were necessary for survival
and long term control of the infection [363].
The importance of an early, local IFN-response in models
including in vivo progression and evaluation of final outcome of infection is more unclear, in that many other viral
and host factors are of importance in these more complicated models with several stages of infection and involvement of different organs. Such models are, however, more
close to the normal human HSV infection, starting at an
epithelial surface, but to expect that one resistance factor
in such a complicated system will come out clear as the
responsible factor for the outcome downstream the
sequence of events, is too simplistic. Nevertheless,
induced expression of IFN-α/β in the eye by plasmid DNA
or an adenovirus vector was shown to inhibit early local
replication of HSV and the concomitant spread of virus to
the brain and death from encephalitis [333,364], and in
IFN-α/βR KO-mice HSV replicated to much higher titres
than in normal mice [297].

http://www.virologyj.com/content/2/1/59

This tells us that the innate and adaptive immune systems
exhibit much redundancy, and that IFN-α/β is of vital
importance in local inhibition of HSV replication. The
multitude of antiviral mechanisms, be it innate or adaptive, have varying effects and importance in the different
phases of infection, such as initial local infection, dissemination to other organs, establishment of latency and reactivation, and conclusions can not be drawn from one
situation to another.

The opening battle
The reactions discussed above, involving production of
IFN-α/β and TNF, take place within the first 6 to 12 hours
of a HSV infection, and thus are reactions, which can
execute an effect within the first replication cycle of the
virus. A little later, other cytokines such as IL-12, IL-18 and
IFN-γ are produced and give rise to other weapons in the
battle against the virus. They will, in turn, within the next
replication cycle execute their actions, with potential
harmful consequences for either parts of the conflict.
IL-12 and IFN-γ production in early HSV infection
A few hours after the type I IFN and TNF response, macrophages react upon HSV infection with production of IL12, which is seen from 8 to 12 hours after infection and
on [238,365]. The same was found with other viruses 12
to 24 hours after infection [366]. In these and other studies, the producers of IL-12p40 during viral infection seem
to be inflammatory cells, including macrophages, and not
the infected stromal cells [365,367]. The IL-12 induction
during HSV infection requires infectious virus, and it was
shown to be regulated at the transcriptional level [238], as
it is also the case when it is induced by LPS [247,367]. The
dependence on infectivity is, however, in conflict with
results from in vivo production of IL-12p40 and IFN-γ in
draining lymph nodes from sites injected with UV-inactivated HSV [302]. High doses of UV-inactivated virus were
used, and some minimal transcription of viral genes could
have taken place, although the virus was not replication
competent. Transcription of the IL-12p40 gene in macrophages requires de novo protein synthesis during the
inducing HSV infection, which could explain the relatively late appearance of IL-12 production [238,367]. The
κB-sequence of the IL-12p40 promoter binds NF-κB in
HSV-infected cells, and the production of IL-12p40 was
found to be repressed by an inhibitor of NF-κB activation
[238]. Both these observations indicate that signalling
through NF-κB is of significance in HSV-induced IL-12
production.

In human macrophages, TNF has been shown to inhibit
IL-12p40 production, but not p35 production, by a mechanism not involving NF-κB [368]. Furthermore, IL-12 has
in a mouse model been shown to stimulate TNF expression [255], indicating that TNF can participate in a

Virology Journal 2005, 2:59

negative feed-back loop in the regulation of the IL-12 system [369]. Likewise, IFN-α/β has been shown to inhibit
IL-12 production in both humans and mice [370-372].
The implication of such inhibition by IFN-α/β and TNF,
which are secreted very early in HSV infections, well
before the production of IL-12, has so far not been
elucidated.
As described earlier, the IL-12p40 induction is influenced
by IFN-γ in a positive feed back loop. IFN-γ could activate
IL-12 transcription through binding of IRF-1, -2, and -8 to
an ISRE site in the promoter-region of IL-12 [373,374].
Upon HSV infection, IFN-γ is produced as part of the nonspecific response to the virus. A marked synergism
between HSV and IFN-γ in IL-12 induction has been demonstrated [238], indicating that the IL-12 / IFN-γ autoaccelerating system is of importance during HSV
infections.

The IFN-γ-inducing activity of the produced IL-12 is pronounced in mouse peritoneal cells after 24 hours of infection with HSV [238]. In a study by Kirchner et al. IFN-γ
was detected as early as on day 3 of in vivo HSV infection,
and the IFN-γ production was correlated to the genetics of
HSV resistance [375]. During HSV infection, the production of IFN-γ is mainly induced as a concerted action of
several factors and not by IL-12 alone. IFN-α/β by itself
was shown to be a weak inducer of IFN-γ production by
NK cells, but in synergy with IL-12 the production of IFNγ was markedly enhanced [376]. In elicited peritoneal
macrophages, HSV induced efficient IFN-γ production
through cooperation of IL-12, IFN-α/β and IL-18 [377]. In
such a proinflammatory environment even other cells
than NK and T cells, e.g. macrophages, might produce
lower levels of IFN-γ [200,202,245]. IL-12 signals through
STAT4, but STAT4 translocation to the nucleus of NK cells
has also been seen after IFN-α/β stimulation [206,378].
Likewise, IFN-α/β induces STAT4 phosphorylation in T
cells [379], indicating that IL-12 and IFN-α/β at this point
act through a shared signalling pathway. Furthermore, the
synergistic action of IL-12 and IL-18 in IFN-γ production
by macrophages was shown to be dependent on STAT4
[197]. In addition to these factors, TNF and IL-1 have also
been shown to act in synergy with IL-12 in IFN-γ induction [206,380,381] and vice versa, IFN-γ has been shown
to synergize with HSV in induction of TNF production
[325]. This further emphasizes the concept of positive
feed-back mechanisms in the regulation of early IFN-γ
production.
The important direct effect of IFN-α/β on HSV replication
was found to be enhanced synergistically by IFN-γ in both
cell culture and in vivo in mice [363,382-384]. This is,
however, in conflict with an early study, which could not
reveal any synergism between IFN-α/β and IFN-γ on the
replication of HSV in human blood mononuclear cells

[385]. Synergistic action of the two types of IFN is further
supported by the observation of synergism between IFN-γ
and TNF on HSV replication in corneal cells, and the fact
that this was exerted through production of IFN-β [386388]. The effect was, however, greatly dependent on the
cell type examined, which could explain the above-mentioned inconsistency. Synergism between TNF and IFN-γ
in inhibition of HSV replication has now been shown to
be mediated by activation of a tryptophan-depleting
enzyme [389]. Thus, relatively small amounts of early
IFN-γ produced by NK cells in response to IL-12, IFN-α/β,
TNF, and IL-18 could in collaboration with the already
present IFN-α/β and TNF have important local effect on
HSV replication in permissive cells (fig. 3). This conclusion is further supported by observations in KO mice,
indicating that collaborated action of IFN-α/β and IFN-γ
is of importance in control of subcutaneous HSV infections [362].
In vivo studies on HSV infections in immunodeficient,
KO, and antibody-treated mice have shown that the IL-12,

Virology Journal 2005, 2:59

-23 / IFN-γ system is able to control the infection, affecting
both the survival rate and the HSV titres early in infection
[390,391]. The effect of IL-12 in HSV infections seems to
be conducted in synergy with IL-18 [390], as it has also
been shown for vaccinia virus [392]. In HSV corneal infections in KO mice, IL-12 was shown to participate in the
immune pathogenesis [393], but in another study utilizing IL-12 encoding plasmid DNA, corneal expression of
IL-12 reduced the angiogenesis, and thus the pathology of
the infection [394]. However, both studies agreed that IL12 does not affect the local titres of HSV in the eye. After
a thermal injury, wide-spread HSV infections are an
important risk, and treatment of injured mice with IL-12
combined with soluble IL-4R results in augmentation of
the IFN-γ production and decreased viral replication and
mortality [395].
In mice infected with murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV)
production of IL-12-induced IFN-γ by NK cells has been
demonstrated in vivo, and the system was further shown to
lower the viral titres [396,397]. The IL-12 / IFN-γ system
seems, however, not to be of importance in all viral infections, in that the latter study could not detect any production of early IL-12 or IFN-γ in a model of infection with
the arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. Analyses of the IL-12, -23 / IFN-γ system in humans with
genetic defects and in KO-mice reveal more redundancy in
man than in mouse and indicate that the system is of
more importance in DNA- than in RNA-virus infections
[219].
The producers of early IFN-γ, the NK and NKT cells, and
the cytokine IL-15 and the transcription factor T-bet,
which are both crucial for the differentiation and function
of these cells, have all been shown to be decisive for the
early control of HSV infection in vivo [268,398-400].
Although NK cells but not IFN-γ was shown to be decisive
for survival from ocular infections [401], such an effect of
IFN-γ has been seen by others [402]. Furthermore, a
review of genetic functional NK cell defects found NK cells
and their innate IFN-γ production to be of central importance in herpesvirus infections [403].
Overall, it can be concluded that the IL-12 / IFN-γ system
is active in HSV infections and possesses an important
antiviral potential, capable of controlling viral replication
during the early phases of infection.
Production of NO in early HSV infection
In macrophages exposed to IFN-γ, the enzyme inducible
nitric oxide synthase is induced, which eventually results
in production of NO from molecular oxygen and a guanidino nitrogen by conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline
[404]. Upon HSV infection, the iNOS gene is induced, as
shown by detection of iNOS-mRNA in infected mouse

controlling the iNOS induction in macrophages (Mφ) during
early HSV infection. IFN-γ, produced mainly by NK cells,
stimulates iNOS production. This IFN-γ-induced production
of iNOS can be inhibited by IL-4. Upon HSV infection of macrophages they produce TNF which synergizes with the IFNγ-induced pathways and inhibits the inhibitory signals of IL-4.

peritoneal cells and corneal neutrophils [405,406]. The
production of NO in HSV-infected cultures of resting
mouse peritoneal cells, which comprise a mixed
population of macrophages, lymphocytes, NK cells etc., is
dependent on the virus being infectious [405]. This is in
line with the requirement of infectious HSV for IL-12 production and thus for production of IFN-γ as described previously [238]. NO could itself be involved in a positive
feed-back, in that signalling of IL-12 utilizing Tyk2
requires the activity of NO [407]. When exogenous IFN-γ
is added to virus-infected cells, a marked synergism is
seen. This synergistic effect of HSV on the IFN-γ-induced
NO production in macrophages was shown to be mediated by autocrine secretion of TNF [325,405]. In line with
this, mice with a targeted disruption of the TNF gene
showed impaired resistance to HSV and increased viral
replication within the first days of infection [408], and
antibodies to TNF and an inhibitor of NO production
impaired early control of HSV infection in peripheral
nervous tissue [409].
The induction of iNOS and the following production of
NO in response to IFN-γ and HSV is a relatively slow reaction, coming up after about 18 hours of infection [405].
In in vivo vaginal HSV infections iNOS mRNA could be
detected after 24 hours of infection [410]. Thus, the production of this relatively toxic substance is part of the second wave of innate defence mechanisms. The retarded
production of NO and the requirement for two or more
signals for induction of iNOS are logic considering the

Regulation of iNOS induction at the molecular level. Transcription factors controlling induction of the iNOS gene. Activated

toxicity of NO and the potentially harmful consequences
for the host.
In HSV-infected macrophages exposed to IFN-γ, iNOS is
induced synergistically though TNF-induced NF-κB activation and translocation to the nucleus, as shown by
binding of a heterodimeric complex of p55/p65 and a
homodimer of p55 to the κB-site of the iNOS promoter
during infection [325]. The crucial position of NF-κB in
the induction of iNOS and production of NO is also indicated by experiments showing that antibodies to TNF
inhibit activation of NF-κB and production of NO in HSVinfected cells and abolish the synergism between the virus
and IFN-γ, an observation which was also seen with inhibitors of NF-κB activation [325]. Further analysis of the signalling mechanism has revealed that the synergism upon
HSV infection is influenced by physical interaction of IRF1 and the NF-κB subunit p65 and controlled by the ISREsite and the distal κB-site of the iNOS promoter (fig. 5)
[411]. A further support for this notion comes from the
observation that the DNA-binding capacity of NF-κB and
the nuclear translocation of IRF-1 have similar kinetics
upon HSV infection [411] and the fact that IRF-1 is
essential for iNOS induction [412]. Induction of other
genes such as IFN-β and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1
also involve physical interaction of IRF-1 and NF-κB
[413], and both IRF-1 and IRF-2 have in other cells types
been shown to form complexes with NF-κB [414,415].
Another potential mechanism in the synergistic induction

of iNOS could involve complex formation of IFN consensus sequence-binding protein (ICSBP or IRF-8) and IRF-1,
which is also important for high-output NO production
but has still not been studied in HSV infections [416].
Thus, high-output NO production from activated macrophages is controlled by a "double-lock" signalling mechanism restricting the production of this antiviral toxic
substance to sites of active viral replication, and sparing
uninfected tissue from the detrimental effects (fig. 4).
The antiviral effects of NO have been documented in several viral infections, although there clearly exist viruses
and conditions where NO does not exhibit major antiviral
properties. NO is thus not a magic bullet against virus
infections [417]. In HSV infections, NO has been shown
to confer a substantial part of the antiviral activity induced
by IFN-γ in a macrophage cell line and to participate in the
extrinsic anti-HSV effect of macrophages [418-421]. An
exogenously added donor of NO has in several cell lines
been shown to reduce the replication of HSV [422]. In
vivo, analysis of mice treated with an inhibitor of NO production showed higher titres of HSV in the lungs but
increased survival rates due to reduced inflammation
[135]. Recently, a study using another inhibitor of NO
production has confirmed the anti-herpetic effect of NO
during a HSV respiratory infection, but in this study mice
with inhibited NO production showed increased inflammatory responses, symptoms of infection, and mortality

[423]. Replication of HSV during vaginal infection was
increased in the presence of an inhibitor of NO
production, and this enhanced viral replication was most
prominent during the first 24 hours of infection [410]. In
iNOS-KO mice, the herpes virus MCMV replicates to
higher titres in various organs and in macrophages, and
this results in impaired survival of the animals [424].
Weanling mice with a targeted disruption of the iNOS
gene showed increased HSV replication, but apparently
without differences in HSV titres during the first days of
infection [425], and in adult KO mice, we could not detect
any significant effect of NO during the early days of a
generalised
HSV
infection
(Ellermann-Eriksen,
unpublished results). Probably, these in vivo results are
due to redundancy of the antiviral system. [426].
The final effects of NO on HSV infections therefore appear
to be balanced between antiviral versus toxic effects, and
the final outcome seems to depend on the timing, infectious dose, and tissues involved. Thus NO production in
the early phases of HSV infection is one of the effector
mechanisms of the innate immune response inhibiting
HSV replication, but when overproduced, NO might itself
result in pathology, as discussed in the following section.
Restriction of NO production during HSV infection
As outlined above, positive feed-back mechanisms exist at
the afferent side of the early cytokine response, involving
especially the production of IFN-γ, IL-12, IFN-α/β and
TNF, and synergisms at the efferent side, resulting in highoutput NO production. As a result of coordinated induction of the iNOS gene by several transcription factors, activated by especially IFN-γ and TNF, a potent early antiviral
system is activated. However, NO causes damage to DNA,
proteins and lipids in cells and tissues and could thus be
deleterious for the host [427-430]. A study in KO-mice
indicates that NO can be responsible for inflammation
and life-threatening symptoms to HSV infection of the
lungs [135]. This effect of NO on pulmonary symptoms is
also observed in influenza virus infections [431],
although NO inhibits replication of both influenza virus
and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
[432,433]. Consequently, when this system is activated, it
has to be controlled and eventually closed down, as it
would otherwise induce unnecessary harm to the host.
Such negative regulations of the iNOS gene induction in
IFN-γ activated macrophages is conducted by IL-4 and IL13 [272,273,434]. Furthermore, TGF-β can exhibit downregulation of NO production through several post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, but the contribution
of these pathways have not been analysed in HSV infections [435,436]. IL-4 production during HSV infection
has in vaginal and CNS infections been demonstrated on

[437,438]. In peritoneal cells from mice infected i.p. pro-

http://www.virologyj.com/content/2/1/59

duction of IL-4 could be detected at day 5 of infection
[439].
At low IFN-γ concentrations, IL-4 has been shown to
inhibit iNOS induction through STAT6 competition with
STAT1 binding to the GAS element of the IRF-1 promoter
region. This results in reduced expression of the transcription factor IRF-1, which is crucial for induction of iNOS
[440]. Generally, STAT6 was shown to be a key factor in
IL-4- and IL-13-induced inhibition of iNOS gene transcription induced by IFN-γ (fig. 5) [441].
At higher IFN-γ concentrations, activated STAT6 is no
longer able to compete with the high amounts of activated
STAT1 dimer [440]. However, in this situation IL-4 is still
able to inhibit the production of NO from IFN-γ-stimulated macrophages [272,273,434]. In the presence of high
levels of IFN-γ, IL-4 is not able to alter the induction of
IRF-1, but the production of IRF-2 is increased [434]. The
human promoter region of IRF-2 contains a SBE, and the
induction of IRF-2 could thus potentially be mediated by
STAT6 binding to this element [442]. This is in agreement
with the fact that IRF-2 is known to compete with the
binding of IRF-1 to ISRE sites and to antagonize the transactivating activity of IRF-1 in the regulation of other IFNinduced genes [443-445]. Inhibition of iNOS expression
by high concentrations of IRF-2 relative to IRF-1 has thus
been proposed as a controlling mechanism in situations
with high levels of IFN-γ (fig. 5) [434]. Furthermore,
another mechanism could evolve from the observation
that IL-4 signalling can result in disruption of the complex
formation of ICSBP and IRF-1 and thereby inhibit iNOS
induction [416]. Other mediators of IL-4-induced repression of iNOS induction might exist, in that another DNAbinding transcriptional repressor competing with IRF-1
has been described [446].
In IFN-γ activated macrophages the IL-4- and IL-13induced inhibition of iNOS induction can thus be overruled by HSV infection, leading to a sustained NO production (fig. 4) [439,447]. This effect of HSV infection is
mediated through TNF production and NF-κB activation
[439,447]. However, pre-treatment with IL-4 has in a
Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus model showed
inhibition of NF-κB activation [448]. In thioglycollateinduced peritoneal cells, LPS and TNF could only overcome the inhibiting effect of IL-4 in situations, where IL-4
was added simultaneously or after the stimulators [272],
a sequence of events which, however, is in agreement with
the sequence of cytokine production in HSV infections.
When activated, the NF-κB p65 physically interacts with
IRF-1 and trans-activate iNOS transcription in HSVinfected and TNF-treated cells [411,449]. It is thus tempting to speculate that the NF-κB-IRF-1 complex has higher
affinity for the combined DNA-binding site and thus is

Virology Journal 2005, 2:59

able to obstruct the binding of IRF-2 to the ISRE site of the
iNOS promoter and in that way turn the competition
towards transcriptional activity (fig. 5) [411]. This will
block the inhibiting effect of IL-4 in foci of HSV replication and open up for NO production at sites where the
antiviral effect is of more importance than the potential
toxicity.

Conclusions and perspectives for future clinical
intervention
In treatment of HSV infections, we have for many years
had a very powerful tool in the antiherpetic drug acyclovir
and related compounds. But there are still therapeutic
problems in the group of patients with generalized or CNS
infections, and therefore it is tempting and timely to
hypothesize on possible future treatment strategies. As
described, it is clear that relatively discrete but early
actions of the non-specific defence systems are crucial for
the long term outcome of the infection. The same holds
for the antiviral therapy, and early presumptive therapy
and rapid diagnostics could thus potentially improve the
final outcome. In the seeking for improved antiviral treatment, adjuvant therapy with anti-HSV antibodies could
potentially accelerate the clearance of viral particles, and
block viremic dissemination in patients, who are still
seronegative at the time of treatment.
Immunomodulatory treatment modalities imitating the
early non-specific antiviral defence, working as described
in this review, could be considered. The key players exhibiting the least toxicity by themselves could be used, taking
advantage of potential synergy with other cytokines in the
foci of HSV infection. In the future, molecules with affinity for various receptors are expected to be produced, and
when we know the signalling mechanisms in detail and
all the potential interactions, molecular signalling could
be addressed directly by pharmaceuticals.
In consequence of the crucial position of the type I IFNs
in innate response to HSV, future analogues of IFN-α/β
seem obvious as candidates for adjuvant treatment of
severe HSV infections. This could be supplemented with
IL-12, which would give the highest IFN-γ production in
foci of HSV infection because of other cytokines such as
IFN-α/β, TNF and IL-18 being present there. With
focussed production of IFN-γ at sites of active viral replication and treatment with IFN type I analogues the focal
antiviral activity could be increased markedly, without too
much activity in areas without infection. To hamper systemic consequences of the enhanced proinflammatory
reactions, such pro-inflammatory treatment could perhaps benefit from concomitant treatment with IL-4 or
other STAT6-activating therapeutics in the future. This
would further focus the activity to sites of active HSV replication. In situations with massive viral replication in

http://www.virologyj.com/content/2/1/59

nearly all organs, high-dose aciclovir should perhaps only
be supplemented with anti-inflammatory medications
and inhibitors of TNF, since many of these individuals
risk to die from septic reactions.
