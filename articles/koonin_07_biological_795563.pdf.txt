Abstract
Background: Major transitions in biological evolution show the same pattern of sudden
emergence of diverse forms at a new level of complexity. The relationships between major groups
within an emergent new class of biological entities are hard to decipher and do not seem to fit the
tree pattern that, following Darwin's original proposal, remains the dominant description of
biological evolution. The cases in point include the origin of complex RNA molecules and protein
folds; major groups of viruses; archaea and bacteria, and the principal lineages within each of these
prokaryotic domains; eukaryotic supergroups; and animal phyla. In each of these pivotal nexuses in
life's history, the principal "types" seem to appear rapidly and fully equipped with the signature
features of the respective new level of biological organization. No intermediate "grades" or
intermediate forms between different types are detectable. Usually, this pattern is attributed to
cladogenesis compressed in time, combined with the inevitable erosion of the phylogenetic signal.
Hypothesis: I propose that most or all major evolutionary transitions that show the "explosive"
pattern of emergence of new types of biological entities correspond to a boundary between two
qualitatively distinct evolutionary phases. The first, inflationary phase is characterized by extremely
rapid evolution driven by various processes of genetic information exchange, such as horizontal
gene transfer, recombination, fusion, fission, and spread of mobile elements. These processes give
rise to a vast diversity of forms from which the main classes of entities at the new level of
complexity emerge independently, through a sampling process. In the second phase, evolution
dramatically slows down, the respective process of genetic information exchange tapers off, and
multiple lineages of the new type of entities emerge, each of them evolving in a tree-like fashion
from that point on. This biphasic model of evolution incorporates the previously developed
concepts of the emergence of protein folds by recombination of small structural units and origin of
viruses and cells from a pre-cellular compartmentalized pool of recombining genetic elements. The
model is extended to encompass other major transitions. It is proposed that bacterial and archaeal
phyla emerged independently from two distinct populations of primordial cells that, originally,
possessed leaky membranes, which made the cells prone to rampant gene exchange; and that the
eukaryotic supergroups emerged through distinct, secondary endosymbiotic events (as opposed to
the primary, mitochondrial endosymbiosis). This biphasic model of evolution is substantially
analogous to the scenario of the origin of universes in the eternal inflation version of modern
cosmology. Under this model, universes like ours emerge in the infinite multiverse when the
eternal process of exponential expansion, known as inflation, ceases in a particular region as a
result of false vacuum decay, a first order phase transition process. The result is the nucleation of
a new universe, which is traditionally denoted Big Bang, although this scenario is radically different

from the Big Bang of the traditional model of an expanding universe. Hence I denote the phase
transitions at the end of each inflationary epoch in the history of life Biological Big Bangs (BBB).
Conclusion: A Biological Big Bang (BBB) model is proposed for the major transitions in life's
evolution. According to this model, each transition is a BBB such that new classes of biological
entities emerge at the end of a rapid phase of evolution (inflation) that is characterized by extensive
exchange of genetic information which takes distinct forms for different BBBs. The major types of
new forms emerge independently, via a sampling process, from the pool of recombining entities of
the preceding generation. This process is envisaged as being qualitatively different from treepattern cladogenesis.

Background
The enigmatic nexuses
The famous single illustration of Darwin's "Origin of Species" shows generalized binary trees. According to Darwin,
"The affinities of all the beings of the same class have
sometimes been represented by a great tree. I believe this
simile largely speaks the truth." [1] Darwin's notion of a
tree as a valid depiction of evolution became the foundation of the grand metaphor of the tree of life (TOL) that
had been propounded as a generally adequate depiction
of the entire history of life, above all, by Haeckel who
expanded Darwin's schematic into an arborescent and
picturesque tree [2].

However, the evolution of life is, obviously, a non-uniform process as described, e.g., in Simpson's classic book
[3,4], and captured, more formally, in the punctuated
equilibrium concept of Gould and Eldredge [5,6]. Lengthy
intervals of gradualist modification are punctuated by
brief bursts of innovation that are often called transitions,
to emphasize the fact that they culminate in the emergence of new levels of organizational and functional complexity [7]. Although it is hardly feasible to compile a
definitive list of biological transitions, certain events, such
as the origin of the first cells, the origin of the eukaryotic
cell, or the origin of multicellular plants and animals, definitely qualify as major transitions. The term "transition"
might not be the most precise descriptor of the pivotal
events in life's evolution because the emerging new forms
do not necessarily (or, even, typically) replace pre-existing
ones (e.g., eukaryotes do not replace prokaryotes).
Instead, in these evolutionary (or, perhaps, more precisely, revolutionary) nexuses, forms with a new level of
organizational complexity emerge that, subsequently,
coexist with the older, simpler forms. Nevertheless, with
this understanding, I use the commonly accepted term
"transitions" through the rest of this article.

There seems to be a striking commonality between all
major transitions in the evolution of life. In each new class
of biological objects, the principal types emerge abruptly,
and intermediate grades (e.g., intermediates between the
precellular stage of evolution and prokaryotic cells or
between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells), typically, cannot be identified. The events that lead to the emergence of
a new level of complexity and, obviously, are crucial in the
evolution of life elude representation through a unique
tree topology and are notoriously hard to reconstruct.
Whatever trees have been constructed for these stages of
life's history, have extremely short, most often, unreliable
internal branches, and the tree topology tends to differ for
different genes [8] (Fig. 1). Below I list the most conspicuous instances of this pattern of discontinuity in the biological and pre-biological domains, and outline the
central aspects of the respective evolutionary transitions.
1. Origin of protein folds
There seem to exist ~1,000 or, by other estimates, a few
thousand distinct structural folds the relationships
between which (if existent) are unclear [9-11].
2. Origin of viruses
For several major classes of viruses, notably, positivestrand RNA viruses [12] and nucleo-cytoplasmic large
DNA viruses (NCLDV) of eukaryotes [13,14], substantial
evidence of monophyletic origin has been obtained.
However, there is no evidence of a common ancestry for
all viruses [15].
3. Origin of cells
The two principal cell types (the two prokaryotic domains
of life), archaea and bacteria, have chemically distinct
membranes, largely, non-homologous enzymes of membrane biogenesis[16,17], and also, non-homologous core
DNA replication enzymes [18]. This severely complicates
the reconstruction of a cellular ancestor of archaea and
bacteria and suggests alternative solutions [16,19].

6. Origin of the animal phyla
The Cambrian explosion in animal evolution during
which all the diverse body plans appear to have emerged
almost in a geological instant is a highly publicized
enigma [32-35]. Although molecular clock analysis has
been invoked to propose that the Cambrian explosion is
an artifact of the fossil record whereas the actual divergence occurred much earlier [36,37], the reliability of
these estimates appears to be questionable [38]. In an
already familiar pattern, the relationship between the animal phyla remains controversial and elusive.

The tree was generated from simulated data using the
TreeView program [114].

4. Origin of the major branches (phyla) of bacteria and archaea
Although both bacteria and archaea show a much greater
degree of molecular coherence within a domain than is
seen between the domains (in particular, the membranes
and the replication machineries are homologous throughout each domain), the topology of the deep branches in
the archaeal and, especially, bacterial phylogenetic trees
remains elusive. The trees conspicuously lack robustness
with respect to the gene(s) analyzed and methods
employed, and despite the considerable effort to delineate
higher taxa of bacteria [20-23], a consensus is not even on
the horizon. The division of the archaea into two
branches, euryarchaeota and crenarchaeota is better established but even this split is not necessarily reproduced in
trees, and further divisions in the archaeal domain remain
murky [23-25].
5. Origin of the major branches (supergroups) of eukaryotes
Despite many ingenious attempts to decipher the branching order near the root of the phylogenetic tree of eukaryotes, there has been little progress, and an objective
depiction of the state of affairs seems to be a "star" phylogeny, with the 5 or 6 supergroups established with reasonable confidence but the relationship between them
remaining unresolved [26-31].

The bushes in the tree of life (TOL) recently have been
examined in some detail, and their appearance has been
attributed, primarily, to cladogenesis compressed in time
that appears to be characteristic of transitional epochs in
evolution. Also, the erosion of the phylogenetic signal
inevitably results in poor resolution of phylogenetic trees
for ancient divergence events like all those listed above.
Nevertheless, it is generally assumed that, in principle, the
TOL exists and is resolvable although, in practice, full resolution might never be attained and, furthermore, might
not even be particularly important for understanding the
actual events that transpired during the respective transitional stages [8,39].
Here, I argue for a fundamentally different solution, i.e.,
that a single, uninterrupted TOL does not exist, although
the evolution of large divisions of life for extended time
intervals can be adequately described by trees. I suggest
that evolutionary transitions follow a general principle
that is distinct from the regular cladogenesis. I denote this
principle the Biological Big Bang (BBB) Model. Under this
model, each of the biological transitions is, indeed, a transition in a more specific, technical sense, i.e., a switch
between two phases of evolution, a phase of rapid evolution (inflation) characterized by rampant exchange and
recombination of genetic material, followed by congealing into a relatively slow phase governed by the tree pattern. This principle shows substantial analogies with the
new model of universe nucleation (a radical re-interpretation of the classic Big Bang) that is part of the eternal inflation cosmology.
Unconventional solutions
In a seminal 1998 paper, Carl Woese proposed that the
early stages of life's evolution including that of the Last
Universal Cellular Ancestor (LUCA), involved rampant
horizontal exchange of genetic material between primordial life forms such that individual lineages could not
form [40,41]. As aphoristically formulated by Woese,
"This communal ancestor has a physical history but not a
genealogical one" [40]. The lineages were thought to
emerge as the "temperature" (used here as a physical metaphor describing the changing intensity of the genetic

Biology Direct 2007, 2:21

exchange) of the evolving mixture lowered and the functional systems of cells "crystallized" (again, metaphorically) one by one.
Subsequently, the notion of a "communal ancestor" has
been developed into a specific scenario [16,19] that
derived from the comparative-genomic indications that
the enzymes of membrane biogenesis and the core DNA
replication machineries in archaea and bacteria were nonhomologous [18,42]. Under this scenario, LUCA was a
diverse population of genetic entities (initially, RNA, subsequently, a mixture of RNA and DNA segments) that
inhabited networks of inorganic compartments at hydrothermal vents. Extensive exchange of genetic content
between compartments, the primordial analog of HGT, is
an inherent feature of this model. A transition from selection for individual genetic entities to the selection for
"selfish cooperatives" (in particular, compartment contents) is thought to have occurred in this system, followed
by independent escape of the first membrane-bounded
cells [19]. There might have been numerous "attempted"
escapes but only two ultimately successful ones, leading
to archaea and bacteria.
The scenario of evolution of non-membrane-bounded
but compartmentalized populations of diverse genetic
elements has been extended and elaborated to include
viruses, and developed into the virus world concept [15].
The notion of the virus world stems, primarily, from the
fact that a set of genes encoding essential proteins
involved in viral genome replication, packaging, and virion formation (virus hallmark genes [15]), are shared by
numerous groups of dissimilar and, otherwise, apparently, unrelated viruses. The early, "communal" stage of
evolution is envisaged as, essentially, virus-like where, initially, the progenitors of viral and cellular genomes were
indistinguishable but, gradually, the segregation of bona
fide parasites (the would be viruses) and selfish cooperatives (the would be cellular life forms) took hold. The
major classes of extant prokaryotic viruses are thought to
have emerged directly from the primordial pool of genetic
elements. In addition, it has been proposed that eukaryogenesis was "the second melting pot" of virus evolution
where the major groups of eukaryotic viruses emerged,
primarily, through recombination between various bacteriophage and cellular genomes.
In a striking parallel, Lupas et al. have proposed that modern protein folds evolved by recombination of ancient
peptide modules, such that the folds have independent
and polyphyletic origins although they all ultimately
derive from the same recombining pool of genetic elements encoding primordial peptides [43]. The recent
demonstration (in simulation studies) that high concentration of RNA would have been readily attainable in net-

works of inorganic compartments at hydrothermal vents
[44] has added credibility to the notion that that recombination and fusion of RNA molecules could have played a
major role even in pre-biological evolution [45,46].
The realization that HGT is extremely widespread among
prokaryotes [47-52], which was one of the principal early
discoveries of the genomic revolution [53], led to a reappraisal of the TOL concept [54-57]. As noticed by Ford
Doolittle, as long as the HGT is quantitatively substantial
and involves, to a lesser or greater extent, all categories of
genes, "Molecular phylogeneticists will have failed to find
the "true tree," not because their methods are inadequate
or because they have chosen the wrong genes, but because
the history of life cannot properly be represented as a
tree." [56]. It has been argued, however, that the TOL still
could be saved, even in the presence of extensive HGT, by
redefining the TOL as the consensus tree of the relatively
stable (refractory to HGT) core of highly conserved genes
[22].
In recent general, philosophically oriented treatises,
O'Malley and Boucher, and Doolittle and Bapteste
[58,59] further question the validity of the TOL paradigm.
Emphasizing the plurality of process in biological evolution, which includes both vertical, tree-like inheritance
and exchange of genetic material between diverse life
forms, traditionally viewed as HGT (although the changing paradigm of microbiology would blur the very distinction between the two processes [58]), Doolittle and
Bapteste call for replacing the tree-centered monism by a
plurality of pattern in evolutionary models [59]. The scenarios of early evolution outlined above fit that bill by
postulating that the early, pre-cellular evolution of life followed a pattern that was qualitatively distinct from the
pattern of subsequent evolution. The principal feature of
the distinct, early phase of evolution is thought to be the
extensive exchange of genetic material that assumes different forms, results in rapid evolutionary innovation, and
precludes the formation of distinct lineages. Here, I generalize on this pattern by proposing that a phase of rapid,
promiscuous evolution might underlie many, if not most
of the major transitions in the history of life. I draw a fundamental analogy between these transitional stages of
biological evolution and the birth of universes from Big
Bang events as interpreted in the eternal inflation model
of cosmology.

Hypothesis: the Biological Big Bang model of
evolutionary transitions
The major transitions in biological evolution as Biological
Big Bang events
I hypothesize that each major biological transition is,
actually, a transition between two qualitatively different
phases of evolution, an initial rapid phase and the subse-

quent, slower phase during which the tree pattern emerges
(Fig. 2). The entire history of life, then, should be depicted
not as a TOL but as a succession of alternating rapid and
slow phases such that each new rapid phase emerges from
a pre-existing tree and, in turn, gives rise to a new tree
phase (Fig. 2). In modern cosmology, there is a striking
analogy to this pattern, namely, the transition from the
rapid, exponential expansion (inflation) of the multiverse

to the much slower expansion occurring during the nucleation of an individual universe (see below). This transition corresponds to the Big Bang of the traditional model
of an expanding universe. Hence I denote the transitional
events in the evolution of life the Biological Big Bangs
(BBBs) and refer to the rapid stages of evolution as the
inflationary phase. I elaborate on this analogy in the next
section.

The principal underlying force of the inflationary phases
of evolution is extensive genetic exchange between the
respective biological entities, taking the forms of recombination, fusion, and fission; the specifics of these processes
differ for different inflationary stages. The process leading
to the emergence of a new generation of increasingly complex entities at the end of each inflationary stage (i.e., the
BBBs) is best described as continuous sampling of numerous combinations of genetic elements. Once, by chance, a

stable, highly efficient combination emerges, a lineage of
the new generation is born (Fig. 2).
Table 1 lists the putative major BBB events in the history
of life on earth. The first four of the BBBs date back to the
pre-cellular era:
1. the emergence of complex RNA molecules, e.g., rRNA,
by fusion/recombination of smaller RNA segments;

2. the emergence of protein folds by recombination and
fusion of RNA segments encoding primordial peptides
and/or non-globular primordial polypeptides containing
small structured units;
3. the emergence of the major classes of virus-like agents
(the progenitors of the prokaryotic viruses) via recombination and fusion of primordial genetic elements;
4. the emergence of archaeal and bacterial cells, via a gene
sampling process, from the same primordial pool of
genetic elements at a later stage.
The existence of an initial rapid phase of evolution, characterized by extensive mixing and matching of genetic elements, has already been proposed for each of these
transitions in previous studies (see above and Table 1).
The recent demonstration that the primordial pool of
RNA molecules might have been highly concentrated
[44], creating favorable conditions for recombination and
fusion [46], lends further credibility to these scenarios.
Conceivably, the first trees ever to emerge during life's history were gene trees which consolidated at the first two
BBBs that gave rise to complex RNA molecules and major
protein folds.
The next two BBBs correspond to the emergence of the
major lineages of bacteria and archaea. As indicated
above, attempts to resolve the relationships between these
lineages through conventional phylogenetic tree building
or through analysis of rare characters (cladistics) yield
conflicting and hardly compelling results. I suggest that
the major lineages of bacteria and archaea are, actually,
not linked by trees. Instead, the emergence of archaea and
bacteria via the respective BBBs would have been followed
by new inflationary phases in which the archaeal and bacterial cells formed distinct communities of cells that
extensively exchanged genetic material. Conceivably, the
membranes of these earliest archaea and bacteria were
substantially more leaky than those of modern prokaryotes [60], making the cells highly susceptible to DNA
uptake. The intensity of genetic exchange was high
enough to preclude the formation of individual lineages.
At this stage of evolution, archaeal and bacterial cells
existed as physical entities (and communities), but conditions for the formation of cell lineages did not, and selection affected genes and gene complexes rather than cells.
Evolution would be rapid, fueled by the rampant gene
flow between cells, albeit not as rapid as the gene
exchange between inorganic compartments during the
pre-cellular inflationary epoch. In concrete, physical
terms, the proto-bacteria and proto-archaea might have
thrived as colonies at hydrothermal vents, outside the networks of inorganic compartments from which the first
cells have "hatched" [16,19]. The proto-bacteria and

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/21

proto-archaea would form physically distinct communities, in principle, similar to the present-day microbial
mats[61,62], with the intensity of the gene flow between
these being substantially lower than that within each of
the communities. Individual bacterial and archaeal cellular lineages would emerge when gene sampling yielded
selectively advantageous combinations with tighter membranes, thus, curtailing HGT. Escapes of the emerging distinct cellular forms from the communities would result in
partial isolation of the lineages, and in dissemination of
distinct bacteria and archaea in a variety of habitats.
The origin of the eukaryotic cell and the emergence of
eukaryotic supergroups can be reasonably perceived as a
single BBB event. The debate around the origin of eukaryotes continues to rage [63-65]. Nevertheless, the most parsimonious scenario has the symbiosis between an
archaeon and an α-proteobacterium (the progenitor of
mitochondria) as the triggering event of eukaryogenesis
[65-67]. Conceivably, this event instigated a new wave of
inflation during which the archaeal host DNA was bombarded by the genes and selfish elements from the symbiont, apparently, leading to dramatic rearrangements
within the hybrid cell, starting with the formation of the
endomembranes and the nucleus [67,68]. The existence
of an extremely eventful, even if temporally brief, "stem"
(i.e., preceding the divergence of the supergroups) phase
of eukaryotic evolution is clearly demonstrated by the
existence of numerous pan-eukaryotic sets of paralogous
genes that evolved at this stage [69]. During the stem
phase, the emerging eukaryotic cell, probably, evolved the
phagocytic capacity and would engulf additional bacteria,
typically, resulting in multiple, transient symbioses and
transfer of a varying number of the bacterial symbiont's
genes to the eukaryotic genome. Effectively, this is the
"you are what you eat" scenario proposed by Doolittle
[70], with the difference that the mitochondrial endosymbiosis is perceived as the event that triggered all aspects of
eukaryogenesis, in particular, the evolution of the phagocytic capacity. A relatively stable symbiosis would result in
the termination of inflation for a host subpopulation and
the emergence of a new cellular lineage, one of the eukaryotic supergroups.
Currently, the evolutionary tree of eukaryotes is best represented as a bush (polytomy) of 5 or, possibly, 6 supergroups [28,31](Table 1). There is no consensus on the
relationship between the supergroups. It is considered certain that the Plantae supergroup, which includes glaucophytes, red algae, green algae, and green land plants
derived from the latter, emerged following the endosymbiosis of a cyanobacterium (the future chloroplast) with
an ancestral eukaryotic eukaryotic cell (which, certainly,
already possessed the mitochondrion) [71-74]. Furthermore, under the so-called chromalveolate hypothesis

Page 7 of 17
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2007, 2:21

[75,76], a secondary endosymbiosis, namely, the engulfment of a red alga by a non-photosynthetic eukaryotic
cell, gave rise the to Chromalveolata supergroup
[74,77,78]. Several additional secondary symbioses that
involve the engulfment of a photosynthetic eukaryote by
a non-photosynthetic appear to have occurred at the base
of several major lineages belonging to different supergroups, e.g., euglenids, diatoms, and dinoflagellates
[74,77,79]. Furthermore, a remarkable variety of transient
and stable bacterial symbionts have been detected in
numerous individual unicellular eukaryotes [80], indicating that establishment of a symbiosis is relatively common, although evolution of symbionts into bona fide
organelles appears to be much harder and rare. I propose
that each of the eukaryotic supergroups emerged from the
ancestral population of early eukaryotes through a distinct
symbiosis with bacteria, as in Plantae, or between primitive eukaryotes themselves, as appears to be the case for
Chromalveolata. Other than in Plantae and Chromalveolata, these postulated, ancient endosymbiotic events,
apparently, have not left vestiges in the form of morphologically distinct organelles (at least, not widespread
ones); however, traces of such events in the form of genes
transferred to the nuclear genome could exist and can be
sought. It should be noticed that, under the chromalveolate hypothesis, secondary loss of endosymbionts is not
uncommon: apparently, it occurred independently in
multiple branches of Chromalveolata, such as the ciliates
and several lineages of heterkonts, dinoflagellates, and
apicomplexans [72,74,77]. Thus, losses of morphologically distinguishable endosymbionts in other supergroups
do not appear implausible either. The chromalveolate
hypothesis remains a subject of debate, and it cannot be
ruled out that it erroneously oversimplifies the history of
secondary endosymbiotic events that have occurred in
eukaryotic evolution [28,74,77]; this would not, however,
bear upon the generality of endosymbiosis coninciding
with BBB in the context of the present argument.
The cosmological connection: eternal inflation and the Big
Bang as a transition between two phases in the evolution
of the multiverse
In this section, I elaborate on the, apparently, deep analogies between the BBB model and the cosmological model
of eternal inflation. First, however, the eternal inflation
model and they way it reinterprets the Big Bang need to be
briefly introduced. The dominant 20th century concept of
the origin and evolution of our universe, implicit in the
Friedmann's solutions of general relativity equations and
developed in the seminal work of Gamow and coworkers,
involved expansion of the spacetime and energy-matter
from an initial state characterized by values of curvature,
density, and temperature that tend to infinity (mathematically, a singularity) [81,82]. The primordial "explosion"
of the initial state has been dubbed (originally, sarcasti-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/21

cally, by the astrophysicist Fred Hoyle, a staunch opponent of the very idea of an expanding universe) the Big
Bang. The Big Bang model of the evolution of the universe
is considered to be, effectively, proved by the discovery of
the low-energy cosmic microwave background radiation
(CMB) [82]. However, the nature of the Big Bang event
had not received a coherent explanation before the
advent, in 1981, of a new generation of cosmological
models that stem from the concept of inflation. Inflation
is the exponentially fast initial expansion of a universe
[83-85]. Inflation is in an excellent agreement with several
crucial results of observational cosmology [85,86]. In the
most plausible, self-consistent inflationary models, inflation is eternal, with an infinite number of island (pocket,
bubble) universes (hereinafter, simply, universes) emerging through the decay of small regions of the primordial
"sea" of false vacuum and comprising the infinite multiverse [87-89](Fig. 3A). Importantly, the "populated landscape" version of string theory independently yields a very
similar model of the multiverse [90-93]. Thus, although
the model of eternal inflation cannot be considered
proved, this is the strongly preferred current scenario of
the cosmic evolution.
In the eternal inflation cosmology, the Big Bang is radically reinterpreted. Instead of being the actual beginning
of time and history, a Big Bang becomes a local transition
between two phases of the multiverse's evolution,
namely, the rapid inflation, driven by the negative pressure of the high energy (false) vacuum, and the relatively
slow expansion of an individual universe. The formation
of complex structures, such as galaxies, is possible only in

the second phase, but depends on quantum fluctuations
of the scalar field of the decaying false vacuum at the end
of inflation in the given region of the multiverse
[85,86,89].
The analogy between this new picture of the Big Bang (but
not the classical one) and the BBB model is apparent and
straightforward. The central feature of both processes is
the transition between a "hot" phase of rapid change and
a "cooler" phase of slower evolution during which the formation of structures becomes possible. The emergence of
a new generation of biological entities as a result of "cooling and condensation" of parts of the inflating pool of
previous-generation elements is analogous to the decay of
small regions of false vacuum in the inflating multiverse –
the multiple Big Bang events – giving rise to individual
(variously denoted as island, pocket, or bubble) universes. The decay of false vacuum can be formally
described as a first order phase transition (e.g., water boiling) [94-96]. To quote the picturesque description given
by Guth, "...bubbles of the new phase materialize randomly in space, just as bubbles of steam form randomly
in water heated on the stove...The rate at which the bubbles materialize depends very sensitively on the details of
the theory, so the decay of the false vacuum can be very
fast, or very slow, or something in between." [85] This
reads like a perfect coarse-grain description of a BBB; it
remains to be seen whether the corresponding mathematical theory can be developed.
Of course, the analogy between the rapid phases of biological evolution and cosmological inflation and the corresponding phase transitions is not a direct, physical one
but pertains to the common general characteristics of
these processes. Similarly to the exponential space expansion during inflation, the brief stages of rapid evolution in
the history of life are characterized by a rapid expansion
of the biological informational space fueled, primarily, by
various forms of recombination, fusion, and fission of
genetic entities (Fig. 3). The evolutionary momentum created by these processes is analogous to the repulsive (negative) pressure of the false vacuum.
Under the eternal inflation model, all the specifics of the
evolution of each universe are determined by quantum
fluctuations of the scalar field of the decaying false vacuum [89]. Hence the events occurring in a particular universe cannot be predicted from any events preceding the
respective Big Bang. This essential unpredictability is paralleled by the random emergence of lineages from the sea
of biological inflation although, in this case, the randomness involved is, of course, deterministic rather than
quantum.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/21

There are, certainly, substantial distinctions between the
BBB model and the eternal inflation cosmology. The enormous differences in scales and energies involved are obvious. Besides, under the eternal inflation model, the
spacetime of the multiverse appears as an infinite sea of
eternally and continuously inflating false vacuum, speckled with nucleating bubbles of universes (Fig. 3A). By contrast, in biological evolution, inflation appears to be
recurring and discontinuous (Fig. 2).
To avoid confusion, it should be noted that inflationary
cosmology appears to be relevant to our understanding of
biological evolution at more than one level. In a recent
paper, I explored direct implications of eternal inflation
for the origin of replication, translation, and biological
evolution itself [97]. By contrast, here, the cosmological
models are used as an analogy; however, I believe that it is
a powerful analogy that can substantially inform our
understanding of the fundamentals of biological evolution.

Discussion and Conclusion
The essence of the Biological Big Bang model is that evolution consists of two, fundamentally different, alternating phases which are underpinned by sharply distinct
processes:
i) the rapid, inflationary phase that is, typically, characterized by extensive fusion, fission, and recombination of
genetic entities
ii) the slower phase that takes over when inflation stops in
a part of a community of recombining genetic elements
and includes the emergent tree pattern of evolution (Fig.
2).
Herein lies the deep analogy with the eternal inflation
model of the evolution of the multiverse in which universes repeatedly emerge as a result of a local halt of inflation caused by the decay of regions of false vacuum (Fig.
3A). The local termination of inflation is a phase transition (in the precise physical sense) that ushers in the second, slower phase of expansion during which, in many
universes with the conducive values of the key parameters
(such as the cosmological constant and the amplitude of
the cosmic microwave background radiation), structures,
such as clusters of galaxies, emerge [98]. This process
appears analogous to the emergence of tree-like evolution
in BBBs. Of course, the analogy between BBBs events and
the cosmological Big Bangs leading to the birth of universes should not been construed in direct physical terms
but rather pertains to the general features of the corresponding processes, in particular, the existence of a rapid
and slow phases of evolution separated by a phase transition.

The major corollary of the BBB scenario of biological evolution (Fig. 2) is that there is no TOL, even though the tree
pattern is a persistent and inevitable feature of life's evolution at numerous stages. The TOL concept is undermined
in the most fundamental, physical sense, i.e., under the
BBB model, the history of cellular life does not represent
a single, interrupted tree of dividing cells [59]. In a close
parallel, the evolution of viruses and related selfish elements is not, even in principle, a single tree of replicating
genomes [15]. The non-existence of TOL does not mean
that trees for individual genes do not exist either. These
trees, conceivably, were brought about by the first BBBs
that involved the nucleation of RNA and protein structures. However, the BBB model implies two crucial aspects
of these trees that are both compatible with empirical
data: i) the deep internal branches of gene trees are
strongly compressed as dictated by the rapidity of evolution during inflationary phases, and ii) in general, there is
no reason for the topologies of the trees for individual
genes to be the same in their deep parts, given the rampant reassortment and recombination of genetic elements
during the inflationary phases (although, toward the end
of an inflationary stage, some gene combinations would
become relatively stable, rendering a degree of coherence
on some of the gene trees). An implication of these
notions is that concatenation of protein sequences in an
attempt to enhance the signal and resolve deep phylogenies, a common approach in genome-wide phylogenetic
analysis [22,99,100], is a highly suspect practice at best.
The BBB scenario outlined here is linked to, and derived
from, directly or indirectly, several previously developed
models and concepts in evolutionary biology. Perhaps,
the most important one, conceptually, is Woese's idea of
a communal stage in the early evolution of life [40,41]
which, indeed, corresponds to one of the inflationary
phases of evolution postulated here (Table 1). It is
remarkable and more than a coincidence that Woese
described the emergence of the biological lineages as a
phase transition [40]. The model is also compatible, at
least, in the broad sense, with Gould's and Eldredge's
notion of punctuated equilibrium [5,6]. As concerns the
BBB event associated with the origin of eukaryotic supergroup, the present concept is, in general terms, in line
with the ideas of Margulis and coworkers on the pivotal
role of symbiosis in evolution [80,101,102]. However, the
symbioses hypothesized here and leading to the emergence of the eukaryotic supergroups are not to be identified with the series of symbioses that led to the emergence
of the eukaryotic cell under the recent hypothesis of Margulis et al [103]; the latter do not seem to find support in
available comparative-genomic data.
Like the recent conceptual analysis of Doolittle and Bapteste [59], the BBB model defies the TOL paradigm. How-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/21

ever, there is also a notable difference between the two
concepts. Essentially, Doolittle and Bapteste submit that
the TOL paradigm is invalid inasmuch as there is substantial HGT. This is, indeed, indisputable as long as the TOL
is uncompromisingly defined as a tree describing the evolution of entire genomes. However, as suggested previously, the tree representation can be useful even when it
reflects the history of a substantial core of genes rather
than all genes [22]. It has been shown that such a core of
genes that do not appear to undergo frequent HGT exists
in major prokaryotic divisions, such as the proteobacteria
[104-106]. Accordingly, I propose here that, whereas the
tree pattern does not, in principle, apply to the inflationary phase of evolution, trees, understood as the evolutionary scenarios for gene cores, are adequate descriptions of
the slower phase.
Recently, Cavalier-Smith developed the notion of "quantum evolution" according to which major cellular innovations in life's history occurred as quantum leaps followed
by periods of relative stasis [107]. The central idea of
"quantum evolution" might, at first sight, seem very similar to the BBB. However, the fundamental difference is
that, according to Cavalier-Smith, quantum evolution
occurs solely via rapid accumulation of mutations not via
the qualitatively different mechanism of genetic exchange
postulated here.
The notion of Big Bang and the term itself have been
repeatedly applied in discussions of rapid cladogenesis in
biological evolution, in particular, with regard both to the
evolution of protein folds [108,109] and to the evolution
of various taxa [26,110,111]. I believe, however, that in
these studies, Big Bang served more as a general metaphor
than a fundamental analogy. Indeed, the traditional Big
Bang model does not seem to have any explanatory potential in this context inasmuch as the Big Bang presents The
crucial distinction is that the previous invocation of Big
Bang dealt with the description of such events in the traditional models of an expanding universe which allowed
only a metaphoric juxtaposition of biology and cosmology. The analogy becomes much more precise and
informative when the interpretation of the Big Bang in
modern inflationary cosmology is invoked instead.
The BBB model, like most concepts at that level of generalization, is hard to test in its entirety but concrete analyses could help both to falsify aspects of the model and to
harness additional support. In particular, a definitive resolution of the deep branches in the phylogenetic trees of
bacteria, archaea, or eukaryotes would substantially
undermine the BBB concept. Conversely, the model suggests that search for additional symbiosis events that
could have given rise to the eukaryotic supergroups other

Page 10 of 17
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2007, 2:21

than Plantae might have potential, and if successful,
would provide a boost to the model.
It remains an open and intriguing question to what extent
the BBB model applies to other transitions in biological
evolution beyond those discussed above, e.g., the emergence of animal phyla during (or before) the Cambrian
explosion, and what would be the mechanisms underpinning the inflationary phase for these transitions. It seems
tempting and potentially fruitful to examine such stages
of evolution for possible mechanisms of genetic exchange
to account for an inflationary phase; invasions of mobile
elements (including viruses) could be one such mechanism. Additionally or alternatively, rewiring of the kernels
of regulatory networks that is thought to underlie the
divergence of animal phyla [112,113] could be a qualitatively distinct evolutionary force triggering a BBB. More
generally, understanding the inflationary phases and the
exact processes occurring during BBBs emerges as a major
goal of evolutionary biology.

Reviewers' comments
Reviewer 1: William Martin (University of Duesseldorf)
If these ideas are drawn from cosmology, that could be
stated, but I don't think they are. Instead it seems that
these ideas emerge independently from cosmological considerations and are founded in evolutionary thinking, not
in cosmological.

Author's response: The ideas, in large part, are, indeed,
drawn from cosmology – more precisely, from the juxtaposition
of specific models of modern cosmology and biological evolution. In the revised text, the cosmological connection is presented firmly and exclusively as an analogy, albeit a deep one.
I should emphasize (and this was made more explicit in the
revised manuscript) that I draw a fundamental analogy
between biological transitions and the interpretation of the Big
Bang in modern, inflationary cosmology. The analogy does not
work with the traditional notion of the Big Bang. Therefore,
without, at least, a general understanding of the distinction
between these two dramatically different notions of the Big
Bang, it is hard to understand the analogy and the paper as a
whole. Hence the discussion of cosmology here required a special section, albeit a brief one.
Abstract: "It is proposed that each major transition during
evolution that shows the "explosive" pattern of emergence
of new classes of biological entities corresponds to a
boundary between two qualitatively distinct evolutionary
processes (phases)" I think that some specification is
needed here, because different biologists have different
views as to what the major transitions are.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/21

Author's response: I have tried to explain what is meant by
transitions but also indicated that it is, indeed, hard to converge
on a complete, definitive list of these.
Abstract: "that the eukaryotic supergroups emerged
through distinct endosymbiotic events". What eukaryote
phylogeny buffs are now calling supergroups are things
like excavates, opisthokonts, archaeplastida, etc. These are
summarized in recent reviews, especially the one by Adl et
al cited in (44). They all have only one and the same
endosymbiont (the mitochondrion), so distinct symbioses is not at all a clear term here. Plants had a second distinct symbiosis, some algae had distinct 2° symbioses, but
that's about it, it seems. So the passage needs clarification.
Author's response: Phrasing was less than precise in the original abstract. Clarifications added, both in the abstract and in
the main text. Yes, I speculate on additional symbioses, even if
they are not discussed by "specialists", and I make it explicit in
the revision.
"identification of symbiotic events that would have led to
the emergence of eukaryotic kingdoms" comment as
above.
Author's response: See above.
In the first two paragraphs of "Background" we see that
the tree concept is being contrasted to a rate concept
(gradualism). That problem occurs throughout the paper.
One cannot easily present rates plus mechanisms (Bangs)
as alternatives to shapes (the tree). I don't really have a
suggestion as to how to fix this problem of the present
paper except for major recouching of the issues. But I do
think that it needs to be fixed.
Author's response: This is an important point, and I
attempted to make it explicit in several places in the revised
manuscript. What I mean is not just a major difference in rate
but a difference in mechanism. The underlying mechanism in
tree phases of evolution is vertical inheritance resulting in
cladogenesis. The underlying mechanism in inflationary stages
is exchange, recombination etc such that organismal lineages
do not exist. The paper is not just about the fallacy of gradualism (something that, indeed, has been emphasized by GouldEldredge, Cavalier-Smith and others). The distinction between
the two phases of evolution is not one of quantity but one of
kind. I agree that this was insufficiently stressed in the original
manuscript, and I attempted to rectify this in the revision.
Abstract: "In each major class of biological objects, the
principal types emerge "ready-made", and intermediate
grades cannot be identified." Ouch, that will be up on ID
websites faster than one can bat an eye.

Page 11 of 17
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2007, 2:21

Author's response: Here I do not really understand the concern. I changed "ready-made" to "abruptly", to avoid any ID
allusions and added clarifications but, beyond that, there is little I can do because this is an important sentence that accurately and clearly portrays a crucial and, to the very best of my
understanding, real feature of evolutionary transitions. Will
this be used by the ID camp? Perhaps – if they read that far into
the paper. However, I am afraid that, if our goal as evolutionary
biologists is to avoid providing any grist for the ID mill, we
should simply claim that Darwin, "in principle", solved all the
problems of the origin of biological complexity in his eye story,
and only minor details remain to be filled in. Actually, I think
the position of some ultra-darwinists is pretty close to that.
However, I believe that this is totally counter-productive and
such a notion is outright false. And, the ID folks are clever in
their own perverse way, they see through such false simplicity
and seize on it. I think we (students of evolution) should openly
admit that emergence of new levels of complexity is a complex
problem and should try to work out solutions some of which
could be distinctly non-orthodox; ID, however, does not happen
to be a viable solution to any problem. I think this is my
approach here and elsewhere.
Regarding the animal phyla, see two new papers on Canfield oceans, where they say that the lineages just got
larger 580 MY ago.
Fike DA, Grotzinger JP, Pratt LM, Summons RE (2006)
Oxidation of the Ediacaran ocean. Nature 444:744–747
Canfield DE, Poulton SW, Narbonne GM (2007) LateNeoproterozoic deep-ocean oxygenation and the rise of
animal life. Science 315:92–95
Author's response: These particular papers seem only tangentially relevant but several others that claim early divergence of
animal phyla and those that criticize that claim are cited in the
revision.
Background, the last paragraph of the 1st subsection:
"Here, I argue for a fundamentally different solution, i.e.,
that a single, uninterrupted TOL does not exist." I think
we are hitting a big snag here that needs a couple of paragraphs of explanation. Ford Doolittle and others are saying that too, but for very different reasons (for example
Doolittle and Bapteste, 2007, PNAS), so it is really necessary to explain what the difference is. I really do think that
the essence of the present paper is a general assault on
gradualism. The people who most vociferously criticize
the ToL concept are saying that i) the ToL is not a tree
because lateral gene transfer is widespread and possibly
the predominating factor in the overall evolution of
prokaryotic gene combinations across chromosomes and
that endosymbiosis with endosymbiotic gene transfer is
important. They are saying that the ToL is not a tree

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/21

because it is not, in the main, bifurcating. This paper is not
commenting on the topology or general shape of the ToL,
but is instead using the term "ToL" without further qualification, hence accepting that a ToL exists in nature (see
here Doolittle and Baptest 2007 for the difference
between really existing ToLs in nature that one might discover and assumedly existing ToLs evidence for which one
might seek), and within a ToL framework is saying that
there are order of magnitude differences in the yearly rate
and nature at which at which growth occurs along the
branches. That comes to the fore with allusions to punctuated equilibrium.
Author's response: Actually, I think herein lies the big misunderstanding and/or the big disagreement. I do not see at all
how the concept presented in this paper is compatible with the
existence of a "single, uninterrupted" TOL. And, I do not see
how any other concept of TOL would be worth of that name. In
the revised version, I try to clarify this in several places.
The cosmology part of the paper would need to be toned
down because even if the cosmology parallels can be
drawn, the substance of the paper needs to stand or fall on
biological arguments, cosmology provides no help at all.
Author's response:It has been toned down in the revision (see
also above).
I think that the discussion of the proposed symbiotic
events needs to be contrasted and compared to what Lynn
Margulis is saying for example in Proc Natl Acad Sci USA.
103:13080–10385 (2006).
Author's response: Contrasted and compared in the Discussion.
Section on Cosmology and Discussion: I do not agree that
any general similarities between biological process and
cosmological process can be drawn. If biologists first have
to read up on their cosmology to understand evolution,
then something must be wrong. Biologists have long listened to chemists and physicists when it comes to early
evolution and its principles. I am convinced that biology
and biochemistry are sufficiently rich as disciplines to
allow the problems to be cast in biological and biochemical terms. That is a plea for a more down-to-Earth presentation of the present text.
Author's response:The presentation was made somewhat
more down-to-Earth in the revision but only so much because I
am still convinced that there is a substantial and informative
(as I see it) analogy between transitional stages of biological
evolution and evolution of the multiverse. I actually think it
would be very, very useful to any evolutionary theorist to familiarize her/himself with modern cosmology (I am tempted to

Page 12 of 17
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2007, 2:21

suggest that is, indeed, necessary, but probably, I should not go
that far). In the very least, many fruitful ideas come out of juxtaposing the two fields. By the way, cosmologists are well aware
of existing parallels and use them often (Lee Smolin with his
cosmic selection – regardless of the ultimate validity of his theory, it is certainly respectable – is the best example). Of course,
any scientist is entitled to stay away from any such far-reaching
analogies but, in all fairness, those who are poised to pursue
them, should have the right to do so as well.
I think that this whole paper needs to be contrasted to previously published literature on LGT, on punctuated evolution, and on endosymbiotic theory in more detail. I think
that most readers will come away with the same feeling.
For topics as broad as this MS is cut out, anything short of
a book is probably too brief. The easy fix is to focus on a
specific point like gradualism.
Author's response: The point about the book is well taken,
too (I am, actually, working on one). However, I think that
anything that requires a book for a full presentation also can be
presented as an "extended abstract" (see Darwin, Charles).
This paper is just such an abstract. Nevertheless, some extra references and a few extra words on each of the aforementioned
issues were added in revision.
Reviewer 2: Sergei Maslov (Brookhaven National
Laboratory)
The manuscript by Eugene Koonin describes a compelling
analogy between several major evolutionary transitions in
the history of life (referred to as Biological Big Bangs or
BBBs) and the inflationary model describing the early
dynamics of our Universe (or rather the multiverse) following the cosmological Big Bang. What conceptually
unifies these two rather disparate phenomena is that both
start with a chaotic phase in which a large number of new
entities is rapidly created. Following a sharp crossover this
phase is replaced with a much slower phase in which these
entities are being tested and gradually refined. I liked the
philosophical message of the manuscript that major innovations usually start with a chaotic, messy, "evolutionary
brainstorming" phase in which freshly generated, still
imperfect elements are being freely exchanged and recombined.

The present manuscript also nicely extends/compliments
the recently published anthropic principle manifesto by
the same author (Biology Direct 2, 15 (2007)).
One question I would like to see addressed in more detail
is to what extent the BBBs have to involve extensive
genetic recombination. In the introduction chapter of this
manuscript the Cambrian explosion is listed among the
greatest evolutionary transition (which it undoubtedly
was). However, this evolutionary transition is later omit-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/21

ted from the list of BBBs discussed in detail in this manuscript. My guess this is because it does not easily fit the
scenario of a rampant genetic exchange. More primitive
multi-cellular organisms were in existence well before the
Cambrian era and it is hard to imagine a scenario in which
multi-cellular organisms would be involved in a largescale swap of genetic material. On the other hand, it is
becoming progressively more and more clear that during
(or immediately before) the Cambrian explosion Nature
experimented with different schemes of wiring the regulatory network for embryonic development (see e.g. the
concept of regulatory "kernels" responsible for different
animal body plans in E.H. Davidson, and D. H. Erwin,
Science 311, 796 (2006)). Thus a more traditional explanation of the Cambrian explosion involves no rampant
horizontal gene transfer but just a very rapid burst of
innovation and diversification following the appearance
of a new scheme for information processing (in this case
represented by the regulatory network orchestrating the
embryonic development).
I would very much like Eugene to share his thoughts on
whether he feels that a large-scale genetic recombination
is in his opinion a necessary condition for a Biological Big
Bang to occur?
Author's response: Certainly, I do not insist on a large-scale
swap of genetic information (i.e, HGT) being the underlying
cause of the emergence of the animal phyla. I suggest leaving
the causes of the acceleration of evolution in this and other late
transitions wide open. I would suspect that bursts of mobile element dissemination could be important as briefly mentioned at
the end of the paper, and possibly, other forms of information
exchange. The issue of network rewiring is also touched upon in
the revision, with two papers of Eric Davidson cited, and in this
context, the possibility of causes of BBBs distinct from genetic
exchange is acknowledged. However, a truly detailed discussion
of animal evolution is outside the scope of this paper.
If it is not I could imagine extending the analogy even further to describe rapid technological transitions such as
(most recently) the appearance of the Internet and the
World Wide Web. Here again the singular act of invention
of a new information processing tool was followed by a
burst of innovation utilizing it in every imaginable way.
As in any of the BBB described in the manuscript in this
case the initial rapid innovative phase will inevitably be
replaced by a much slower phase in which various "body
plans" for Internet-based services are tested and gradually
refined (or altogether discarded).
Author's response: Very interesting ideas, indeed...

Reviewer 3: Leonid Mirny (Massachusetts Institute of
Technology)
This is a very provocative and thought-provoking paper:
provocative in putting forward a radical hypothesis of
early evolution, and thus provoking to think it over and
weight its feasibility. The hypothesis sounds reasonable
and very plausible to me. Below I sketch some directions
of the theoretical research that can further elaborate evolution through BBBs.
Organization
1. I found the manuscript to be very well written but
somewhat redundant. I think it will benefit from shortening. E.g., problems that stimulated the development of the
model (new folds, viruses, bacteria and archaea, eukaryotic cells and phyla) are listed in several sections of the
manuscript. This makes the introduction somewhat
lengthy. I wish a reader had a shorter road to the exciting
core of the paper (pages 13–16, in my opinion).

Author's response: I understand the sentiment but these are
highly non-orthodox ideas, so I believe the long introduction
should be helpful for most readers.
Questions/suggestions
1. The emergence of the new folds in attributed to the first
BBB. I would think that each BBB leads to the emergence
of new genes and folds, specifically the one that lead to
the emergence of the eukaryotic cell with its unique
eukaryotic genes and folds.

Author's response: There seems to be a bit of a misunderstanding here. Certainly, there was some (though, limited)
emergence of new folds associated with different BBBs. However, the first BBB involved the emergence of the very first distinct protein (and RNA) folds.
2. The emergence of eukaryotic cell and eukaryotic lineages are put together into a single BBB. The emergence of
the bacteria and formation of bacteria lineages, in contrast, are split into two distinct BBBs. Perhaps eukaryotic
BBB can be thought of as a two-stage process: (i) the emergence of the proto-eukaryotic cell through multiple symbiotic events and expansion of its population, followed by
(ii) the formation of the major eukaryotic lineages
through continued swallowing of other cells. The protoeukaryotic cell may contain the hallmark of the eukaryotes (e.g. nucleus, chromatin etc), while missing some specific organelles that distinct the lineages (e.g.
chloroplasts). An alternative view would be that both
processes were happening independently and at the same
time. This possibility sounds questionable, as it may not
be able to explain the common features of all eukaryotic
cells. I think description of this BBB needs some clarification.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/21

Author's response: Yes, I envisage this BBB more like a twostage process. A variety of amendments and clarifications were
made to the description, in part, also, in response to the criticisms of Reviewer #1.
3. Emergence of the protein synthesis – one of the most
puzzling, to my mind, event in evolution, remains
untouched in this new picture of evolution leaving it to be
invented in the bubbling guts of the hydrothermal vents.
I wonder whether the BBB view of evolution can shed
light on this mystery.
Author's response: Of course, the origin of protein synthesis
(a great challenge, indeed!) is related to the first BBB. Beyond
that, however, I am not immediatel sure how the BBB model
could help. For two complementary perspectives, see my recent
papers: Wolf, Y. I., Koonin, E. V. On the origin of the translation system and the genetic code in the RNA world by
means of natural selection, exaptation, and subfunctionalization. Biology Direct 2007, 2:14, and Koonin, E. V. The

Some thoughts
1. Evolution with extensive HGT
An intriguing theoretical problem is to develop a mathematical model of evolution in the population of cells
through extensive HGT (or, broadly, with "leaky" cell
walls and rapid exchange of genetic material). Intuitively,
evolutionary processes in such communities can be quite
different from the picture drawn by the classical population genetics. Consider dynamics of an advantageous new
gene in such (HGT+ leaky cells) population. The spread of
this gene will be driven by two processes: growth of the
sub-population of cells carrying this gene (classical picture) and faster and faster spread of the gene through HGT
as the sub-population carrying the gene growth. Taken
together these processes can lead to more rapid (than in
the classical picture) fixation of an advantageous allele.
Thus it is not only the mere fact of extensive production of
the new genetic material through HGT, but also the
underlying dynamics that can make BBBs effective melting pots of evolution.

I would also expect such process (leaky cells+HGT) to be
more efficient than evolution in compartmentalized cellfree communities of molecules in hydrothermal vents
(HGT only).
Author's response: Yes, I quite agree, hopefully, we will be
able to develop a mathematical model in a reasonable future.

2. Mechanism and causes of "heating" and "cooling"
The next piece of the puzzle to be sought is the understanding of the mechanisms that lead to initiation and termination of BBBs. To my mind, the key question is
whether periods of BBB have been triggered by some environmental events or by spontaneous nucleation (or
both).

Author's response: Yes, I think both factors were important.
One possibility is that a population model of BBBs (leaky
cells+HGT) may lead to a possible solution of the problem by suggesting mechanisms of spontaneous initiation
and termination of BBBs. For example, the winners in the
BBB evolution (i.e. cells that reached some local maximum of fitness) may benefit from sealing their cell walls
and thus leaving the community to (i) prevent further
recombination events that may ruin their local advantage;
(ii) stop sharing of the advantageous genomes with other
cells to secure their own advantage. It would be interesting
to see whether a model of BBB where cells may stochastically switch from an altruistic (open walls) to a selfish
(closed walls) behavior lead to spontaneous "sporulation" of selfish wall-sealed cells that have reached locally
optimal fitness, thus leading to effective "cooling" of a
BBB.
Author's response: Again, I agree, it will be interesting and,
hopefully, feasible to develop such models.

As for the initiation of BBB, the author proposes that the
small population size may be lead to inventions due to
fixation of otherwise deleterious mutations. Perhaps,
more generally, one can think of numerous populations
that undergo Muller ratchet catastrophes, thus shrinking
and leading to this "last whisper" inventiveness. One of
which may end up inventing a mechanism for BBB (e.g.
swallowing other cells).
