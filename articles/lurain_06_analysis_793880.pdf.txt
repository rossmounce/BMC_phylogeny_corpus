Abstract
Background: Although the sequence of the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) genome is generally conserved
among unrelated clinical strains, some open reading frames (ORFs) are highly variable. UL146 and UL147, which
encode CXC chemokine homologues are among these variable ORFs.
Results: The region of the HCMV genome from UL146 through UL147A was analyzed in clinical strains for
sequence variability, genotypic stability, and transcriptional expression. The UL146 sequences in clinical strains
from two geographically distant sites were assigned to 12 sequence groups that differ by over 60% at the amino
acid level. The same groups were generated by sequences from the UL146-UL147 intergenic region and the
UL147 ORF. In contrast to the high level of sequence variability among unrelated clinical strains, the sequences
of UL146 through UL147A from isolates of the same strain were highly stable after repeated passage both in vitro
and in vivo. Riboprobes homologous to these ORFs detected multiple overlapping transcripts differing in temporal
expression. UL146 sequences are present only on the largest transcript, which also contains all of the downstream
ORFs including UL148 and UL132. The sizes and hybridization patterns of the transcripts are consistent with a
common 3'-terminus downstream of the UL132 ORF. Early-late expression of the transcripts associated with
UL146 and UL147 is compatible with the potential role of CXC chemokines in pathogenesis associated with viral
replication.
Conclusion: Clinical isolates from two different geographic sites cluster in the same groups based on the
hypervariability of the UL146, UL147, or the intergenic sequences, which provides strong evidence for linkage and
no evidence for interstrain recombination within this region. The sequence of individual strains was absolutely
stable in vitro and in vivo, which indicates that sequence drift is not a mechanism for the observed sequence
hypervariability. There is also no evidence of transcriptional splicing, although multiple overlapping transcripts
extending into the adjacent UL148 and UL132 open reading frames were detected using gene-specific probes.

sequences of the groups may vary by as much as 50% or
more depending on the ORF. In many cases the majority
of nucleotide changes are non-synonymous, which results
in similar variability for the predicted amino acid
sequences.

Background
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) has a double-stranded
linear DNA genome of approximately 235 kbp in length
making it the largest of the human herpesviruses. Analysis
of the complete genome of several strains predicts over
160 open reading frames (ORFs) [1-3]. The overall nucleotide sequence of strains isolated from unrelated sources
is relatively conserved, however, the sequences of specific
ORFs can be highly variable. Sequence variation was initially described in the glycoprotein B (gB) gene of clinical
HCMV strains [4]. The discovery of a genomic region in
the Toledo strain that had been deleted from the prototype laboratory strain AD169 [5], added a new set of previously unrecognized open reading frames (ORFs).
Sequence comparisons of specific ORFs in this region as
well as in the remainder of the genome of HCMV clinical
isolates have revealed a surprisingly high level of variability. These ORFs include RL6, RL12, UL4, UL18, UL55
(gB), UL73 (gN), UL74 (gO), UL139, UL144, and UL146
[2,4,6-14]. The variability appears not to be randomly
generated but usually occurs as a limited number of distinct sequence groups. The consensus nucleotide

There is relatively little evidence for linkage among these
hypervariable genes. Variant groups of gN and gO, which
are encoded by adjacent ORFs UL73 and UL74, appear to
be strongly linked [15,16], although they are not found in
the same glycoprotein complex. In contrast gO and gL
whose products are components of the same glycoprotein
complex are found in different genetic combinations in
unrelated HCMV strains [17]. Attempts to establish linkage of gB sequence groups with several other hypervariable ORFs have generally produced negative results
[7,8,13,16].
Several of the encoded products of the hypervariable
ORFs in HCMV have predicted immunomodulatory function. Of particular interest is the UL146 ORF, which
encodes a C-X-C chemokine homologue [18,19]. The

UL146 product has functions associated with α-chemokines including induction of chemotaxis, calcium flux, and
neutrophil degranulation [18,20]. The product also
appears to be required for infection of neutrophils [21].
Despite these established functions, UL146 is among the
most variable of the HCMV ORFs. Although the variability
occurs throughout the nucleotide sequence [2], phylogenetic analyses have shown that the UL146 sequences of
clinically unrelated patients cluster in defined sequence
groups [2,22].
The adjacent UL147 ORF, which is also variable, encodes
a second C-X-C chemokine homologue, although no
chemokine-associated activity has been reported [19]. The
UL147A ORF begins only two nucleotides downstream of
the UL147 coding sequence, but no function has been
assigned to the predicted product [2,3,23,24].
In the current study, we characterized the UL146
sequences, the neighboring ORFs UL147 and UL147A,
and the intergenic regions of a large number of HCMV
clinical isolates focusing on the following characteristics
of this genomic region: 1) the variability and sequence stability of HCMV clinical strains during long-term replication both in vitro and in vivo; 2) the potential linkage of
the UL146, UL147, and UL147A ORFs; and 3) the transcriptional pattern associated with these ORFs.

Results
Sequence variability of the UL146 ORF
Phylogenetic analysis was performed on a total of 50
UL146 sequences. Of these, 48 were obtained from clinical HCMV strains isolated from different patients at the
two different sites: 29 strains from Chicago and 19 strains
from Portland. The highly-characterized strains Towne
and Toledo were also included in the phylogenetic analysis. Among these strains the length of the ORF ranges from
342 to 375 nucleotides encoding predicted proteins of
114 to 125 amino acids. The nucleotide variability is as
high as 58% between strains such as CH-14 and PT-18
(Figure 2). Despite this variability the strains can be
placed into 12 discrete sequence groups differing by at
least 10%. The amino acid sequences generate the same
groups with the overall percentage of variability greater
than 60% (Figure 2). These have been numbered in Figure
2 based on homology with groups defined by Dolan et al.
[2], who reported a total of 14 sequence groups. There
were no strains homologous to their groups 4 and 6. In
some cases, strains from Chicago and Portland have identical UL146 nucleotide sequences. For example the
sequence of PT-18 (Chicago) is identical to that of C194
(Portland) and BI-5 (Chicago) is identical to C954 (Portland).

http://www.virologyj.com/content/3/1/4

The CXC chemokine motif is conserved in all strains, and
the majority of the UL146 sequences have an adjacent ELR
motif as well. The ELR residues have been shown to be
required for chemokine function and binding and activation of the receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2 [25-27]. The variable X residue of the CXC motif in our strains is most
often proline, although arginine, threonine, and lysine are
also found in that order of frequency. Five strains, CH-1,
CH-2, CH-5, CH-14, and CH-22 from Chicago have the
ELR motif replaced by the variant NGR sequence (Figure
2, Group 5), which has been described in other studies
[2,9,10,22]. In addition, the complete UL146 nucleotide
sequences of these 5 strains in Group 5 are either identical
or differ by no more than a single nucleotide, and the X
residue in the CXC motif is consistently threonine.
Besides the cysteine residues in the CXC motif, each of the
50 strains has two additional cysteine residues, which
occur at approximately the same positions in the individual strain sequences. These residues are homologous to
those of the prototype CXC chemokine, IL-8, which form
disulfide bonds with the cysteines of the CXC motif
[25,28]. Predicted N-linked glycosylation sites are not
conserved among the UL146 sequence groups. Group 1
containing the Toledo strain has three predicted sites, one
of which lies within a putative signal sequence [2]. Other
groups have only single sites (Group 8) or lack sites altogether (Group 7).
The hypervariability of the UL146 ORF led to an analysis
of the sequence components downstream of the UL146
stop codon. A subset of 32 strains was selected for this
analysis: 17 from Chicago and 13 from Portland plus
Towne and Toledo. This included the intergenic region
between UL146 and UL147 plus each of the downstream
ORFs, UL147 and UL147A. The sequence groups that
were defined by the original set of 50 strains are all represented except Group 3.
Sequence variability of the intergenic region between
UL146 and UL147
The intergenic region between UL146 and UL147 showed
a very high degree of variability. This is the result of not
only nucleotide differences, but also the length of this
non-coding region, which ranges from 43 to 214 bp
depending on the strain. However, within sequence
groups defined by UL146, the associated intergenic nucleotide sequences and sequence lengths are either identical
or differ by no more than 2 nucleotides, and all are AT
rich.

A dendrogram of the intergenic sequence groups (Figure
3) shows the same relationships of the strains within the
groups as those determined by phylogenetic analysis of
the UL146 sequence. For example all Group 7 strains
based on intergenic sequences in Figure 3 are found in

Group 7 strains based on UL146 in Figure 2. The longest
intergenic sequence was found exclusively associated with
sequences that have the aberrant NGRCXC chemokine
motif, which are all in Group 5. These results indicate that
the UL146 sequences are consistently linked to specific
intergenic sequences.

components except UL147A have different nucleotide
lengths. In general the non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions are reflected by a slightly greater variability at
the amino acid level. Despite this hypervariability, isolates
BI-5 from Chicago and C954 from Portland have identical
sequences for the entire region UL146 through UL147A.

Sequence variability of UL147
Alignment of the UL147 ORF sequences in the 32 isolates
showed that the 5' half (basepairs 1–216) varied by as
much as 22% at the nucleotide level with a corresponding
amino acid variability of 26%. By comparison the 3' half
of the ORF (basepairs 217–480) showed only 3–4%
nucleotide and amino acid sequence variability. The overall variability of the UL147 ORF is approximately 15%.
The length ranges from 474 to 480 nucleotides, which
translates into a difference of only 2 amino acids among
unrelated strains. Several isolates have 2 adjacent methionine codons at the predicted start site, which leads to
ambiguity in determining the initiation codon. There is a
completely conserved DXRCXC chemokine motif where
the first X represents either an arginine or lysine residue
and the second X is always an arginine residue in the
strains that we analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis based on
UL147 alone (Figure 4), again showed sequence groups
very similar to those determined by UL146 sequences,
which suggests that the linkage observed for UL146 and
the intergenic region can be extended to include UL147.
There are no N-linked glycosylation sites encoded by any
of the 32 UL147 amino acid sequences.

UL144 sequence groups
Previous work with the UL144 ORF, which is a TNF receptor homologue [29], showed that there is sequence variability of up to 20% and the sequences are distributed
among three major groups one of which can be divided
into 3 subgroups [6,7,30,31]. A limited number of UL144
sequences from the Chicago strains were compared using
the previously published UL144 group designations [7] to
determine whether there is any linkage between UL144
groups and those defined by the UL146-UL147A region.
There was no evidence of linkage as demonstrated by several strains that grouped together based on similar UL146UL147A sequences but differed in their UL144 sequences.
For example, NW23-2, PT3, and PT20, are all in the same
UL146 group (Group 7, Figure 2), but they represent
UL144 groups 2, 3, and 1A respectively [7].

Sequence variability of UL147A
The predicted initiation codon of the UL147A ORF is
invariably 2 nucleotides downstream of the UL147 stop
codon, which shifts the reading frame from that of UL147.
The UL147A ORF is highly conserved among all strains
with a maximum of 6–7% variability in the nucleotide
and amino acid sequences. The length of the ORF is invariably 228 nucleotides. Sequence groups are not distinguishable, because of the high level of conservation. There
are no N-linked glycosylation sites.

Sequence stability of the UL146 ORF in virus isolates
passaged in vitro
A possible mechanism for generating the UL146 hypervariability could be gradual drift during long-term virus replication. To address this possibility by in vitro methods,
11 isolates from Portland and 2 from Chicago were each
passaged a minimum of 10 times and as many as 47 times
in cell culture (Table 2). The phenotype of the isolates
changed from cell-associated to extracellular as a result of
these multiple passages. Despite the change in phenotype,
all strains in Table 2 with the same designation have identical nucleotide sequences. The results demonstrate that
passage of the same strains in cell culture over several
months produced no detectable changes in the nucleotide
sequence of the UL146 ORF. This is particularly evident in
comparing the nucleotide sequences of the low passage
versus high passage isolates from subjects N, P, G, and T,
which are identical.

Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the 3 ORFs
UL146, UL147, and UL147A and the UL146-147 intergenic region based on the analysis of the 32 isolates. All

Sequence stability and analysis of the UL146 ORF in virus
isolates passaged in vivo
Because cell culture represents only one cell type and contains no cells of the immune system, the effect of longterm infection on UL146 variability in vivo was investigated. Multiple isolates were collected from some of the
patients over a period of several months to several years at
both the Chicago and Portland sites. The UL146 nucleotide sequence of each individual strain was found to be
identical for all isolates from the same patient for periods
of up to several years, as shown by isolate pairs NW23-B/
C, CH1-A/B, X199/C239 and C1917/C198 in Table 2.

There were 3 pairs of kidney transplant recipients from
Portland and 1 pair of lung transplant recipients from
Chicago, for which both recipients received organs from
the same donor. These are patients R1 and R2, L and Z, C
and Y, CH-1 and CH-2 (Table 2). All donors were HCMV
seropositive (D+) and some were documented to have
transmitted one or more strains of CMV to multiple recipients. Isolates were obtained over periods of up to 5 years
post-transplant. All isolates from recipients having the
same donor had identical nucleotide sequences. Thus,
passage of the same strain in different hosts over long
periods of time did not alter the UL146 sequence. Some
of these strains were also subjected to extensive passage in
cell culture and still retained absolute sequence stability.
Of note in this regard is the stability of strain W1 from isolate C246, which represents cell culture passage 47 of a
blood isolate from 108 days post-transplant.
In some cases there was evidence that patients were
infected with more than one strain. However, the integrity
of individual strains within the same patient was maintained. For example, Chicago isolates NW23-A and
NW23-B are from the same patient. The UL146 sequence
of the earlier isolate, NW23-A (Group 10), from a colon
biopsy differs significantly from that of NW23-B (Group
7), an isolate obtained 5 months later from a bronchoaveolar lavage (BAL). A third isolate, NW23-C also from a
BAL obtained more than 5 years later is identical in
sequence to NW23-B. The recipient was HCMV seropositive and received an organ from a seropositive donor (D+/
R+), therefore, the recipient was infected with two different strains (NW23-1 and NW23-2) from two unrelated
sources. The original isolate likely represents reactivation
of the endogenous HCMV strain present pre-transplant,
and the later isolates were derived from the donor strain.
Kidney transplant recipients R1 and R2 had 2 strains in
common, although recipient R2 shed one of the strains
only intermittently (Table 2) [32]. Identical sequences for
each strain were found in isolates from different compartments (blood and urine) and isolates obtained at different
times post-transplant.

Sequence stability of UL147 and UL147A
To extend the analysis of strain stability, the UL147 and
UL147A ORFs were sequenced in clinically related isolates
obtained at different time points as much as several years
apart. In a total of 8 different cases, all isolates from the
same patient had identical UL147 and UL147A
sequences. Thus, the same sequence stability observed for
the UL146 ORF appears to apply to these ORFs as well.
Transcriptional profile
The transcriptional pattern associated with this group of
ORFs was analyzed to further characterize their relationship from the standpoint of potential splicing and temporal expression. RNA was extracted from virus-infected cells
at 10–14 days post-infection. Figure 5A shows representative RT-PCR products generated by the forward primer
upstream of UL146 and the reverse primer downstream of
UL147A. A total of 15 UL146-UL147A RT-PCR products
amplified from unrelated Chicago strains were sequenced.
These strains represent different UL146 sequence groups.
In each case the sequence of the RT-PCR product was identical to the sequence of the PCR product derived from the
viral genomic DNA. The differences in the sizes of the
products reflect differences in the lengths of the intergenic
regions. These results indicated that there is a single transcript that contains all three ORFs with no evidence of
splicing. The RT-PCR analysis was extended using the
same forward primer upstream of UL146 with primers
downstream of UL148 and UL132. Figure 5B shows cDNA
products from strains CH-21 (Group 1) and CH23
(Group 9) amplified by each of the three sets of primers.
The sizes correspond to the products predicted by the
genomic sequence. Sequencing of the UL146-UL148 and
UL146-UL132 products again showed no evidence of
splicing. When a conserved forward primer upstream of
UL145 was used with the reverse primer downstream of
UL147A, no cDNA product was obtained indicating that
the UL145 ORF is not on the same transcript that contains
UL146, UL147, and UL147A.

Northern analysis was performed with 5 different riboprobes to determine the number and sizes of the transcripts containing these ORFs (Figure 1). At 7–10 days
post-inoculation, RNA was extracted from cells infected
with strains CH-1, CH-22, CH-18, and CH-19, which represent three different UL146 sequence groups (Groups 5,
9, and 1). Both CH-1 and CH-22 belong to the Group 5
strains that encode the NGRCXC motif (Figure 2). The
extracted RNA was hybridized with riboprobes 1, 2, or 3
(Figure 1). Ribroprobe 1 was designed to be specifically
antisense to the variable UL146 coding sequences of CH22, although it contains approximately 80 basepairs of the
upstream noncoding sequences, which are conserved
among all of the strains. The probe hybridizes with a single transcript (Figure 6A). The hybridization is strongest

Virology Journal 2006, 3:4

with the homologous RNA from strains CH-1 and CH-22
(Group 5) and less intense with CH-18 (Group 9) and
CH-19 (Group 1) RNA samples, which have much lower
sequence homology. The completely homologous RNA
bands (CH1 and CH2) are approximately 3.7 kb in size.
The bands detected for CH19 and CH18, which have limited homology to the probe, are slightly smaller as predicted by the differences in the length of the UL146UL147 intergenic region. Reprobing the same northern
blot with riboprobe 2, which is antisense to the three
ORFs (UL146, UL147, UL147A), shows 2 additional transcripts of approximately 3.1 and 2.5 kb in length (Figure
6B). Riboprobe 3, which contains only the relatively conserved 3-prime UL147 sequences, detects the same 3 transcripts (Figure 6C). These results indicate that UL146
sequences are present only on the largest transcript, which
also contains UL147 sequences. The smaller transcripts
contain UL147 sequences but have no sequences in common with UL146.
To determine the temporal expression of the transcripts,
RNA produced in the presence or absence of the DNA replication inhibitor, foscarnet (400 µM), was obtained for
northern analysis at different time points post-inoculation. Using riboprobe 1, the large 3.7 kb transcript
appears at 48 h post-infection (Figure 7A) and is inhibited
to a large extent but not completely by 400 µM foscarnet
(Figure 7B). The small amount of detectable transcript in
the presence of foscarnet suggests early-late temporal control. A similar set of blots was hybridized with riboprobe
2. In the absence of foscarnet the 2.5 kb transcript is
detected at the earliest time of 24 h and remains detectable up to 144 h post-infection (Figure 7C). As shown in
Figure 7D, foscarnet does not affect the 2.5 kb transcript,
which indicates its early temporal expression. The 3.1 kb
transcript does not appear until 48 h post-infection but is
expressed up to 144 h post-infection. This transcript is
completely inhibited by foscarnet (Figure 7D), which is
consistent with the characteristics of true late temporal
expression.
The size of the RT-PCR product obtained using primers
flanking UL146 and UL132 (Figure 5) plus the length of
the 3.7 kb transcript detected by riboprobes 1, 2, and 3,
indicates that this transcript contains more than the
UL146, UL147, and UL147A ORFs. Riboprobes 4 and 5
were designed to detect the downstream ORFs UL148 and
UL132. In the absence of foscarnet, riboprobe 4 (antisense to both UL148 and UL132) detected 3 smaller transcripts of approximately 2.2 kb, 1.7 kb, and 1.0 kb in size
in addition to the larger transcripts detected by riboprobes
1, 2, and 3 (Figure 7E). In Figure 7F the 1.7 kb transcript
is unaffected by foscarnet (early transcript), while the 2.2
kb transcript appears to be inhibited by the drug (late
transcript). The larger transcripts (3.7, 3.1, and 2.5) show

http://www.virologyj.com/content/3/1/4

the same temporal expression in the presence of foscarnet
as detected by riboprobes 1 and 2. The pattern of transcription detected by riboprobe 5, which is homologous
to UL132 was identical to that detected by riboprobe 4
(data not shown). Cellular RNA did not hybridize with
any of the riboprobes (Figure 7C and 7E, lanes labeled U).
The northern results reveal that the largest RT-PCR product spanning UL146 through UL132 is derived from the
3.7 kb transcript, because UL146 sequences are not
present on any of the other transcripts detected from this
region. The size of the 3.7 kb transcript would exclude
additional ORFs downstream of UL132 in the absence of
splicing. No splicing was detected by sequencing the corresponding RT-PCR product. The 3-prime UL147 ORF
sequences are present on the next smaller transcripts (3.1
and 2.5 kb). UL132 sequences are present on all of the
transcripts associated with this region, which suggests
there may be a common transcriptional 3-prime end.
Analysis of the Toledo sequence for polyadenylation signals provides further evidence for 3' co-terminal transcripts, because there is a single consensus sequence at bp
12,563 just downstream of UL132. The next closest signals are 2.8 kb upstream and 2.3 kb downstream of this
site, which are not consistent with the size and hybridization patterns of the observed transcripts. HCMV strains
Merlin (GenBank Accession # AY446894) and 3157 (GenBank Accession # AY446867) have similar patterns of poly
A signals in the homologous region.

Discussion
This study has focused on a region of the HCMV genome
that encodes products potentially very important for the
overall pathogenesis of the virus. To our knowledge this is
the first comparative study of all of the genomic components of the ORFs from UL146 through UL147A and the
first report of multiple overlapping transcripts expressed
from this region.
The results show that among clinical HCMV strains there
is a gradient of sequence variability that ranges from very
high to low beginning with the UL146 ORF and progressing downstream through UL147A. Paradoxically, the
hypervariable UL146-UL147A sequences of individual
strains were found to be completely stable throughout
long term propagation in vitro and in vivo.
The adjacent UL146 and UL147 ORFs have conserved
CXC chemokine motifs and are positionally conserved in
all clinical strains of HCMV that have been characterized,
although they have been deleted from some laboratory
strains [5]. They are therefore not essential for virus replication in vitro, but appear to be maintained for infectivity
in vivo. The pattern of multiple CXC chemokine homologues is also found in the genomes of other primate

CMVs [24,33,34] but not murine CMV (MCMV) [20] perhaps reflecting a divergence in evasion strategies.
The cumulative evidence from this study and others
clearly establishes the hypervariability of the UL146 ORF
among clinical HCMV strains [2,9,10,22]. These results
emphasize that within a defined sequence group, UL146
sequence similarities exist among unrelated clinical
strains from widely separated geographic areas, while at
the same time there is a high level of UL146 sequence
divergence between different groups within individual
geographic areas. Despite the hypervariability, all
reported UL146 sequences including those in the present
study have conserved functional residues associated with
CXC chemokines [2,9,10,22]. ELR residues adjacent to the
CXC motif are also present in most of the UL146
sequences. ELR-positive CXC chemokines have been
reported to induce angiogenesis and vascular remodeling
through binding to CXCR2, while ELR-negative chemokines are angiostatic [26,35,36]. The UL146 protein
expressed from the Toledo strain induces CXC chemokine
functions including neutrophil chemotaxis, calcium flux,

and degranulation and binds to CXCR2 [18]. However,
the angiogenic activity of UL146 has not been determined. In UL146 Group 5 sequences (Figure 2) the ELR
residues are replaced with NGR. The arginine residue that
is considered to be absolutely essential for receptor binding [27] is retained, but the potential effect of the NG substitution on chemokine functions is not known. All of the
UL147 sequences have DXR residues in the homologous
positions of the ELR residues next to the CXC motif. Similar to the UL146 sequence, the arginine residue required
for receptor binding is conserved in all UL147 sequences,
but no chemokine-related functions have yet been attributed to the UL147 product.
Recently it was reported that ELR-positive CXC chemokine activity is elevated in association with bronchiolitis
obliterans syndrome (BOS) [35] in lung transplant recipients. In association with the elevated CXC chemokines
there was vascular remodeling of the trachea and aberrant
angiogenesis. HCMV infection and disease is a frequent
and serious complication for lung transplant recipients.
Although HCMV infection was not included in the analy-

sis for the BOS study, these new findings suggest a possible functional link between HCMV chemokine activity
and human disease. It will be important for HCMV pathogenesis to determine whether such a link exists and how
sequence variability could affect this function.
Further sequence examination of the intergenic region
between UL146 and UL147 produced two unexpected
findings. First, it was found to be highly variable in both
nucleotide length and sequence. This is surprising because
in previous analyses of other variant HCMV genes [7](N.S.
Lurain, unpublished data), the coding sequences from all
unrelated clinical isolates could be amplified using a single set of primer pairs from the non-coding flanking
regions, suggesting that the sequences of these flanking
regions are generally conserved. The upstream non-coding
sequence of UL146 has conserved primer binding sites,
but the intergenic region provides no conserved downstream site. A second unexpected finding is the consistent
linkage of the highly variable intergenic sequences with
specific UL146 ORF sequence groups. The UL147 ORF has
lower overall sequence variability than the UL146 ORF.
However, phylogenetic analysis based on UL147
sequences shows that the strains cluster in the same
groups determined by the UL146 and intergenic
sequences. Thus, there is no evidence for recombination
between UL146 and UL147.

In contrast, the present study established that the
sequence groups of the hypervariable UL144 ORF are not
linked to the UL146 sequence groups even though UL144
is less than 1 kb upstream of UL146. We have previously
shown UL144 to be unlinked to the variable gB gene,
which is more than 90 kb upstream [7]. These data along
with those reported by others indicate that most of the
known hypervariable ORFs are unlinked, which suggests
that so far, with the exception of UL146 and UL147, the
pattern of known variant genes present in each strain was
most likely generated over very long periods of time by
recombination events [8,11,15]. The lack of recombination within the region UL146 through UL147A is further
supported by the fact that there are HCMV strains from
each geographic site that have identical sequences spanning this entire region. This raises the question of how the
hypervariability has evolved. We addressed this question
first by investigating the possibility of cumulative
sequence drift over long-term virus propagation. Serial
passage of multiple clinical isolates over several months
in cell culture failed to produce even a single nucleotide
substitution despite phenotypic changes from cell-associated to cell-free virus. This in vitro approach confirms that
long-term cell culture does not add sequence artifacts.
However, cell culture lacks components of the immune
system that could produce sequence drift through selection of antigenic variants.

The start site of the UL147A ORF is invariably only 2
nucleotides downstream of the UL147 stop codon.
Despite the highly conserved sequence of the UL147A
ORF, this very short 2-basepair sequence between the
UL147 and UL147A ORFs strongly suggests linkage to the
rest of the region. However, there is no known functional
relationship between the predicted products of UL147
and UL147A.

The possibility of sequence drift in vivo was addressed by
analyzing sequential isolates obtained from transplant
recipients over long-term follow-up of several months to
several years, a much longer period of follow-up than that
of previous studies [10,22]. All isolates from specimens
from the same patient including those from different
body compartments maintained identical UL146
sequences demonstrating that no sequence drift occurred

in vivo. The most convincing evidence that in vivo passage
of HCMV strains does not produce sequence drift comes
from the data from four matched pairs of transplant recip-

ients with the same donor. All isolates from related
patient pairs have identical nucleotide sequences of the
UL146-UL147A region, and in the case of CH1 and CH2

Page 13 of 18

Virology Journal 2006, 3:4

the sequence identity was maintained over a period of
almost 5 years. Thus, passage of the same strain in different hosts did not select variant UL146 sequences.
Some patients had evidence of infection with more than
one strain, for example subjects R1 and NW23 (Table 2).
However, the UL146-UL147A sequences of each individual strain remained stable over long-term passage both in
vitro and in vivo with no evidence of recombination. We
would predict from the observed sequence stability of
HCMV strains during long-term passage that even minor
sequence differences among isolates from the same
patient indicate the presence of multiple strains rather
than sequence drift of a single strain. This prediction can
be confirmed by analyzing the sequences groups of other
unlinked variable genes such as UL144 and gB detected
among the same isolates.
The close linkage and sequence stability of the UL146UL147A ORFs led to the investigation of potential splicing and temporal expression of transcripts from this
region. Analysis of RT-PCR products revealed a single
large transcript that contained not only the UL146UL147A ORFs but also the downstream UL148 and
UL132 ORFs. The RT-PCR sequences showed no evidence
of spliced transcripts. Northern analysis identified a dominant large 3.7 kb transcript that hybridized with riboprobes representing all 5 ORFs, and also identified 5 other
transcripts ranging in size from approximately 1.0 to 3.1
kb that hybridized with riboprobes from one or more of
the ORFs. UL146 sequences were only detected on the
largest transcript (3.7 kb), and UL132 sequences were
detected on all transcripts. The transcripts represent different temporal classes as determined by the time of expression post-infection and by the effect of foscarnet on that
expression. Based on size and hybridization patterns,
UL146 appears to be expressed only from the large 3.7 kb
transcript, which has early-late kinetics. UL147 is likely
expressed from the 3.1 kb transcript, which has true late
kinetics. These results are slightly different from earlier
microarray analysis of HCMV transcriptional expression
based on the Towne strain [37], which indicated that
UL146 (UL152 in Towne) and UL147 have similar earlylate kinetics. The discrepancies likely result from the inability of microarray analysis to distinguish overlapping
transcripts. Penfold et al. [18] reported that the UL146
protein is expressed with true late kinetics as shown by
foscarnet inhibition, but no transcriptional analysis was
reported. However, early-late transcriptional expression is
compatible with the potential timing of chemokine activity that would likely play a role in pathogenesis after viral
replication.
The northern analysis of the UL146-UL132 ORFs shows a
transcriptional pattern and complexity similar to that

http://www.virologyj.com/content/3/1/4

found in other genomic regions of HCMV including the
UL93-UL99 ORFs [38,39], which have: 1) overlapping
transcripts with different 5-prime termini; 2) co-terminal
3' ends; and 3) different temporal expression of the transcripts. The RT-PCR and northern data show a series of
transcripts that all include UL132 sequences at the 3' end
but vary in the number of upstream ORFs and differ in
their temporal expression. The single poly A signal, which
is downstream of the UL132 stop codon, supports the
possibility of a common 3'-terminus for all of these transcripts [2,5].

Conclusion
Despite an extensive characterization of the UL146UL147A ORFs, we are left with the question of how the
UL146 protein with an apparent defined function that is
conserved in all HCMV clinical isolates has developed
such a highly variable but stable amino acid sequence.
The results of our study allow us to rule out several mechanisms that might generate sequence diversity. Sequence
drift was eliminated as a mechanism by the long-term in
vitro and in vivo passage of a large number of HCMV isolates, which produced no sequence changes in individual
strains. A second possible mechanism is selection of
immune escape mutants as has been reported for the
m157 ORF of MCMV [40]. The in vivo stability of UL146
and UL147 especially in paired transplant recipients,
however, argues against a similar selection for HCMV. An
immune escape mechanism may exist for HCMV, but it
appears not to be based on either of these two genes. Transcriptional splicing is a third potential mechanism for
generating sequence diversity, yet is unlikely, because the
single UL146 transcript is unspliced.
Finally, interstrain recombination is a common mechanism for generating sequence variability [15], which
requires co-infection by genetically different strains
within the same cell. A recent study of co-infection of
MCMV strains reports evidence for frequent co-infection
of the same cell but little evidence of recombination
between the strains [41]. An increase in the fitness of an
attenuated MCMV strain in the presence of a wild-type
strain was shown to be the result of trans-complementation rather than recombination. Similarly, the linkage of
the UL146-UL147A ORFs and the stability of individual
strains in co-infected patients, do not support recombination as a mechanism for generating the sequence diversity
observed in this region. This appears to be an unusual
finding among HCMV variable ORFs, because the cumulative data for a number of other variable HCMV ORFs
[7,11,15] suggests that recombination between them
must have occurred over the course of virus evolution
leading to the generation of a seemingly unlimited
number of distinguishable HCMV strains. A recent report
suggests that intrastrain recombination between UL146

Page 14 of 18

Virology Journal 2006, 3:4

and UL147 may be a mechanism for generating the
observed variability [34]. However, the absolute sequence
stability in vitro and in vivo along with the conserved
groups based on UL146 through UL147A sequences from
widespread geographic sites do not appear to support this
mechanism.
It is very possible that the variability of the UL146 and
UL147 ORFs may have evolved in a host-specific manner
over a very long period of time, which has been postulated
for hypervariable ORFs found in human herpesvirus 8
[42,43]. The fact that the differences among HCMV strains
based on UL146-UL147A sequences do not present as
random changes but instead occur as defined sets of
amino acid substitutions suggests that there may be selection based on virus and/or host functional constraints.
Variability of host factors such as CXCR2 or MHC haplotypes may affect the ability of specific virus genotypes to
productively infect individual hosts. Although there is no
evidence so far that HCMV strains differ in pathogenicity,
undoubtedly both host and viral factors are involved in
determining the outcome of HCMV infection.

Methods
Virus isolates and specimens
HCMV isolates and HCMV-infected specimens (white
blood cells and urine) were obtained at two geographically distant medical centers: the VA Medical Center and
Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR and
Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL. Samples
from specimens obtained for normal patient care including viral isolates, white blood cells, and urine were collected from selected patients over periods of several
months to several years as well as from 4 pairs of solid
organ transplant recipients (3 kidney, 1 lung) who were
infected through organs obtained from a common
HCMV-positive donor. The use of these specimens as discarded clinical material was in accordance with federal
guidelines, and the study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at both Rush University Medical
Center and the Oregon Health and Science University.

virus-infected cells began to release extracellular virus.
Cell culture supernatants from these isolates were harvested after multiple subsequent passages.
DNA extraction and PCR amplification
For the Chicago isolates, CMV genomic DNA was
extracted from infected HFF monolayers, culture supernatants, or directly from patient specimens using the
QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Inc., Valencia, CA). The
extracted DNA served as the template for PCR amplification using the GenAmp XL kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA). For the Portland isolates, HCMV DNA was
extracted from infected HFF cultures using a Hirt method
[44]. Viral DNA from ultracentrifuged urine sediment was
extracted by alkaline lysis as previously described, or by
SDS-proteinase-phenol extraction [45].

The UL146 ORF was amplified from DNA extracts from
the Portland patient specimens using the outer primers 5'TTACGGAACCGTGTCTGAGT-3' (forward) and 5'-GTTGATGTG ACGACGCACGGCTTGC-3' (reverse). Nested
PCR was performed with the inner primers 5'-GAAACCTAATTGACGTGTGATCG-3' (forward) and 5'-AGCCAGCACTTCCTGACGATT GCAG-3' (reverse). The outer
primers alone were used to amplify the UL146 ORF from
DNA extracted from infected cells in cultures. The amplification protocol for the Portland isolates was 95°C 2 min
for 1 cycle, 15 cycles of 94.5°C for 30 s, 54°C for 30 s,
72°C for 1 min followed by 15 cycles of the same temperatures and times except that the 72°C extension was
increased by 5 s per cycle.
For specimens from Chicago both the UL146 and UL147
ORFs were amplified as one product using the primers 5'GATGTGTCATGGACGCAGTT-3' (forward) and 5'CAGAAG ATGAGGAGCAGGAA-3' (reverse). PCR amplification was carried out using the GeneAmp XL Kit (Applied
Biosystems). The amplification protocol was 94°C 1 min
for 1 cycle followed by 30 cycles of 94°C 1 min, 60°C for
10 min.

Viable isolates were received as infected human foreskin
fibroblast (HFF) monolayers in tube cultures, which were
trypsinized and passed to fresh uninfected monolayers.
The level of infectivity was increased by repeated rounds
of trypsinization and redistribution of infected monolayers as well as by passage of infected cells to new monolayers. The total number of passages required to reach a level
of 60 to 80% infectivity was usually in the range of 4 to 6.
All of these strains remained cell-associated and stocks
were maintained as infected cells.

The UL147A ORF was amplified from the Chicago specimens with the same forward primer used for the UL146UL147 product described above and the reverse primer 5'CGCT ACCAGCATGACGTCTC-3', which is downstream
of the UL147A stop codon. The resulting product contained the UL146, UL147, and UL147A ORFs. The primers used for the Portland specimens for the same region
were 5'-GCTTAAGCCAATCGCAGCGAGC-3' and 5'-GTC
GCCTCGGTAGCTCAGTAGC-3'. The amplification protocols were the same as described above for the UL146UL147 products.

For stability studies, selected isolates from Portland were
passed multiple times beyond the point at which the

The UL144 ORF was amplified in a subset of the Chicago
isolates using the forward primer 5'-TCGTATTACAAAC-

CGCGGAGAGGAT-3' and reverse primer 5'-ACTCAGACACG
GTTCCGTAA-3'.
The
conditions
for
amplification were 94°C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles
of 94°C for 1 min, 55°C for 1 min, 72°C for 1 min and
ending with a single extension cycle of 72°C for 5 min.
DNA sequencing
DNA sequencing reactions were performed using the
BigDye Terminator Kit version 3.0 or 3.1 (Applied Biosystems). The reactions were analyzed using either an ABI
PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) (Chicago) or ABI 377 Automated Sequencer (Portland).
UL146 sequencing primers for specimens from Portland
were 5'-GAATTGATGTGTCATG GACGCAG-3' (Forward)
and 5'-GACAGGTGTCGTACCGAT-3' (Reverse). For specimens from Chicago, the UL146 coding strand was
sequenced using the forward PCR primer above. The
reverse sequence was obtained using the primer 5'-CCAGCACTTCCTGACGATTG-3'.

Sequencing of UL147 required additional primers. The 5prime end of the coding sequence of UL147 could not be
obtained with a universal primer, because the intergenic
region between UL146 and UL147 does not contain conserved primer binding sites. The sequence of this region
was obtained using the reverse primers for UL146 and
UL147 (above) and one of the following overlapping
reverse primers: 5'-ATCTCTGCGAGGATGCTAGT-3' or 5'TGGCCAGGCACCGAACTCAA-3'. The 3-prime portion of
the UL147 ORF plus the entire UL147A ORF was
sequenced using the forward primer: 5'-AAGCTGCAATCGTCAGGAAG-3'. The sequence of the non-coding strand of UL147A was obtained with the reverse PCR
primer described above. Portland primers for UL147
sequencing were 5'-GCAGGACGAGCGTGAAC AGC-3'
and 5'-GTTGATGTGACGACGCACGGCTTGC-3'.
RT-PCR
RNA was extracted from infected cells using the RNeasy kit
(QIAGEN). The extracts were treated with DNase I (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription was performed using the
SuperScript First Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen).
cDNA was produced by amplification with the UL146 forward primer and either the UL147 or the UL147A reverse
PCR primers. Additional cDNA products were generated
using the UL146 forward primer with reverse primers
downstream of the UL148 or UL132 ORFs. The UL148
reverse primer sequence is 5'-TC TTGCTATGTCCGCGAACG-3', and the UL132 reverse primer sequence is
5'-AGATCCC GAGTACGACTAGG-3'. Control reactions
that did not include the reverse transcription step were
amplified in parallel reactions to check for DNA contamination.

http://www.virologyj.com/content/3/1/4

All RT-PCR products were sequenced to check for splicing.
The primers described above were used for the UL146UL147A portion of the cDNA products. An additional
sequencing primer was used for the UL148 coding strand:
5'-ACGCTCCTCGTCACTTGTGT-3'. Three additional
sequencing primers were used for UL132: 5'-TACACCCTGTCACCGAA AGC-3' (forward); 5'-CTGATCGCGGTAGTTTACTC-3' (forward); and 5'-TCACGAACGAC
GTGTCCAAG-3' (reverse).
Northern analysis
Northern analysis using the NorthernMax-Gly kit
(Ambion) protocol was performed on the same RNA
extracts used for RT-PCR. In addition, RNA was extracted
at 24, 48, 72, 96, and 144 h post-infection from cells that
were infected with selected HCMV strains and grown in
the presence or absence of 400 µM foscarnet. RNA Millennium Markers™ (Ambion) were run on each gel for size
determinations. RNA samples were mixed with loading
buffer containing glyoxal followed by electrophoresis on
1% agarose gels. RNA was transferred to Brightstar nylon
membranes (Ambion). Five different riboprobes were
made using cloned templates of cDNA products inserted
into the pGem-TA vector (Promega) (Figure 1). Riboprobe 1 contains 216 bp specifically antisense to the
UL146 ORF of isolate CH-22 and 87 bp of the upstream
UL146 flanking region. Riboprobe 2 is antisense to 1095
bp of the coding sequences containing the complete
UL146 and UL147 ORFs from isolate CH-22. Riboprobe
3 is antisense to 177 nucleotides of the UL147 ORF (bases
225 to 402) from isolate CH-19. Riboprobe 4 is antisense
to 1990 bp spanning the coding sequences of UL148 and
UL132, and riboprobe 5 is antisense to 303 bases of the
UL132 ORF. Both riboprobes 4 and 5 were derived from
isolate CH-19. A riboprobe was also produced from the
Millennium Marker™ Probe Template (Ambion) for detection of the RNA Millennium Markers™. The recombinant
plasmids were linearized and RNA representing the noncoding strand was generated using either T7 or SP6 RNA
polymerase and labeled by incorporation of digoxigenindUTP (Roche Applied Science). Hybridization of RNA
blots was carried out at 68°C overnight. The blots were
visualized by addition of anti-digoxigenin antibody
labeled with alkaline phosphatase followed by addition
of the substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate
(BCIP) and nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT).
Phylogenetic analysis
The amino acid sequences of the UL146 and UL147
sequences were aligned using Align Plus 5 version 5.11
(Scientific and Educational Software). Gaps were removed
using the Gapstrip tool from the Los Alamos National
Laboratory http://http//hiv-web.lanl.gov. Phylogenetic
analysis was performed on the processed sequences using
program modules from the Phylip program package ver-

sion 3.6a2, obtained from J. Felsenstein, University of
Washington, Seattle, WA [46]. The SEQBOOT module
was used to generate 100 bootstrap data sets. Genetic distances were calculated from the bootstrap data using PROTDIST, and the resulting values were used to generate
phylogenetic trees using NEIGHBOR. A consensus tree
was computed by CONSENSE. The depiction of the tree
was produced using TreeView [47]. For the UL146-147
intergenic region a dendrogram was generated from the
DNA sequences using Align Plus 5 version 5.11 (Scientific
and Educational Software).
