Abstract
Background: A knowledge of the positions of introns in eukaryotic genes is important for
understanding the evolution of introns. Despite this, there has been relatively little focus on the
distribution of intron positions in genes.
Results: In proteins with signal peptides, there is an overabundance of phase 1 introns around the
region of the signal peptide cleavage site. This has been described before. But in proteins without
signal peptides, a novel phenomenon is observed: There is a sharp peak of phase 0 intron positions
immediately following the start codon, i.e. between codons 1 and 2. This effect is seen in a wide
range of eukaryotes: Vertebrates, arthropods, fungi, and flowering plants. Proteins carrying this
start codon intron are found to comprise a special class of relatively short, lysine-rich and
conserved proteins with an overrepresentation of ribosomal proteins. In addition, there is a peak
of phase 0 introns at position 5 in Drosophila genes with signal peptides, predominantly representing
cuticle proteins.
Conclusion: There is an overabundance of phase 0 introns immediately after the start codon in
eukaryotic genes, which has been described before only for human ribosomal proteins. We give a
detailed description of these start codon introns and the proteins that contain them.

Background
Ever since eukaryotic genes were discovered to be interrupted by introns, there has been a heated debate about
the origin and evolution of introns. The "introns-early"
school believes that introns were present in the last universal common ancestor of pro- and eukaryotes, and that
intron loss is responsible for the lack of introns observed
in bacteria. The "introns-late" school, on the other hand,
believes that introns have appeared during the evolution
of the eukaryotic lineage, and that intron gain is a frequent event in the evolution leading to the gene structures
we see today. This debate continues to generate a huge

amount of literature; for a recent review, see Rogozin et al.
[1].
On this background, it is surprising that the question of
intron position distribution in eukaryotic genes has
received relatively little attention. As an exception to this,
it has been observed that introns are not uniformly distributed over the entire gene, but tend to be more abundant close to the 5' end. This locational bias is especially
seen for genes with only a single intron. Sakurai et al. [2]
found the 5' bias for genes with a single intron in 6 out of
7 genomes studied (it was absent in Arabidopsis thaliana).
In the unicellular organisms Saccharomyces cerevisiae and

Plasmodium falciparum, which have relatively intron-poor
genomes, there was a marked 5' bias for all introns. Mourier and Jeffares [3] found that the 5' bias was only seen in
intron-poor genomes of unicellular organisms. Interestingly, they found no 5' bias in Plasmodium where Sakurai
et al. [2] had seen it. Recently, Lin and Zhang [4] investigated 21 complete eukaryotic genomes and reported that
5' bias was found in all of them, including both uni- and
multicellular organisms. They used a different way of testing this than the other two groups: instead of normalizing
all intron positions to a number of bins and adding them
up before doing statistical tests, they treated each gene as
an independent test and recorded its intron positions as 5'
biased, 3' biased, or equally distributed. It is hypothesized
that the origin of the 5' bias is related to the mechanism
of intron loss: a spliced mRNA can be converted to an
intron-less cDNA by reverse transcription, and if the
cDNA then recombines with the gene, one or more
introns are lost. Since the reverse transcriptase begins
from the 3' end of the mRNA, incomplete cDNAs predominantly represent the 3' end of the gene, and therefore,
intron loss preferentially occurs in the 3' end [2,3].
Also intron gain seems to occur preferentially in the 3'
end, Sverdlov et al. [5] reported. They found that phylogenetically old introns (with positions conserved between
distant phylogenetic lineages) showed an excess in the 5'
end, while new introns in intron-rich genomes were
found preferentially in the 3' end. The 5' end of an intron
is referred to as the donor site, and the 3' end as the acceptor
site. The position of the donor and acceptor sites relative
to the reading frame is referred to as the phase of the
intron: a phase 0 intron is positioned between two
codons, while a phase 1 intron disrupts a codon after the
first position and a phase 2 intron after the second position. In most coding regions, phase 0 introns are the most
common, followed by phase 1 introns and then phase 2
introns as the least common [6,7]. In proteins with secretory signal peptides, however, phase 1 introns are the
most common [8].
Introns are recognised by the spliceosome, a complex of
several small ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) [9].
There is an almost completely conserved consensus
sequence for the donor and acceptor sites, the two first
positions in the intron being "gt" and the last two positions "ag". Exceptions to this rule exist, but they are rare.
Burset et al. [10] did a comprehensive analysis of EST-supported canonical and non-canonical splice sites and
reported that 1.29% of the introns, after correcting errors,
had sequences other than "gt...ag." The majority of these
(approximately half) were "gc...ag," and the other patterns
each comprised less than 0.05%.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/256

It has been found that introns with the non-canonical
sequence "at...ac" comprise a special group recognised by
its own spliceosome, where the rare U11 and U12 snRNPs
have replaced the standard U1 and U2 particles [11].
There is also some weaker sequence conservation on the
exon side of donor and acceptor sites. The consensus
sequence for the exon-exon junction is "ag|g" where the
"|" denotes the position of the intron [12]. This has been
described as the "proto-splice site" as it is assumed that
new introns are predominantly inserted into an "ag|g" site
[13]. Coghlan and Wolfe [14] indeed found that recently
gained introns (as inferred from phylogenetic analyses)
had a stronger "ag|g" consensus than older introns. However, the "introns-early" school, who tends to be skeptical
of the notion of intron gain, has found that the occurrence
of "proto-splice sites" does not agree with the distribution
of intron phases found in extant organisms [15]. The
existence of a nucleotide consensus flanking existing
introns is, of course, no guarantee that the sites are remnants of original proto-splice sites; they might also have
evolved convergently after the introns appeared in order
to adapt to the splicing machinery. Sverdlov et al. [16]
addressed this question by examining the context of
introns inserted at amino acids that were totally conserved
between eight diverse eukaryotic genomes. By considering
only nucleotides that could not be changed without
changing the amino acid, they arrived at a splice site
sequence context that had not been modified by directional selection, and it turned out to have the same consensus as that of all splice sites. The conclusion is that
either introns have been inserted preferentially into protosplice sites, or they have been inserted at random but preferentially fixed if the sequence context was a proto-splice
site.
Another question is whether shared intron positions
reflects evolutionary conservation or parallel gain of new
introns. Qiu et al. [17], using a Bayesian modeling of
intron evolution, found that most introns shared between
distantly related species are results of parallel gains. This is
in contrast to two more recent papers. Sverdlov et al. [18]
constructed a dynamic model of intron insertion by using
a weight matrix for the proto-splice sites and inserting
introns with a probability proportional to the weight
matrix score. Their simulated results suggest that only a
small fraction (5–10%) of shared intron positions in distantly related species are due to parallel gains. Nguyen et
al. [19] used a maximum likelihood estimator where the
number of target sites (potential intron positions) was
treated as an parameter to be estimated, and their results
suggest that parallel gains account for ≈18.5% of shared
intron positions. When comparing the genes for cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins to those for mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, however, the same group found that all

shared intron positions between these two groups
resulted from parallel gains [20]; a result consistent with
the introns-late view that the bacterial ancestor of mitochondria did not have introns.
It is a matter of debate whether intron position correlates
with protein structure. If the "introns-early" theory, also
called the "exon theory of genes" is correct, proteins
should have evolved by assembly of small autonomous
modules or structural domains, and one should expect
that exons in proteins will correspond to boundaries of
such modules. Stoltzfus et al. [21] tested this and found
no correlation between intron position and protein structure. On the other hand, de Souza et al. [22] found that
phase 0 introns were indeed found at boundaries of compact protein modules, and Fedorov et al. [23] reported
that this was especially true for phylogenetically old proteins (common to pro- and eukaryotes). Recently, Whamond and Thornton [24] analysed intron positions in
relation to amino acids and protein secondary structure.
They found that the distribution of intron positions in the
three structural classes helix, sheet, and coil was different
from the background distribution, but this bias could be
largely explained by the nucleotide preferences surrounding the introns (the proto-splice sites).
Tordai and Patthy [25] investigated the distribution of
introns in human genes with and without signal peptides,
and found a significant excess of phase 1 introns in the
vicinity of the signal peptide cleavage site. The reason for
this is hypothesized to be that proto-splice sites of phase
1 correspond to glycine codons ("ggn"), and positions -1,
-3, -4 and -5 relative to the cleavage site are significantly
enriched in glycine. It also correlates well with the fact that
extracellular proteins often have evolutionary modules or
domains that are bounded in both ends by phase 1
introns [26].
Recently, Vibranovski et al. [8] (from the "introns-early"
side) reinvestigated this phenomenon and reported that
all "g|g" intron contexts, not only "ag|g" proto-splice sites,
were enriched in the region of the signal peptide cleavage
site, and that the entire sequence of proteins with signal
peptides were enriched in phase 1 introns. On this background, they claim that exon shuffling, rather than intron
insertion into proto-splice sites, must be the explanation
for the phase 1 signal peptide peak.

Results
Intron length distribution
During splicing, the intron assumes a lariat structure,
where the 5' end is covalently attached to a branch point
a short distance upstream of the 3' end [9]. The intron
must have a certain minimum length for this lariat formation to be possible, but exactly how short an intron can be

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/256

is a matter of some debate. Goodall and Filipowicz [27],
using deletion mutants, found that the minimum functional intron length in plants (both monocots and dicots)
was between 70 and 73 nt. They noted that this length
requirement is similar to that seen in vertebrates, but significantly greater than that in fungi and insects.
Introns shorter than this occur in GenBank. The shortest
of them are probably annotation errors, but where should
we set the cutoff? In order to find a non-arbitrary lower
length threshold for introns, the intron length distribution was calculated on the GenBank data – vertebrates,
arthropods, fungi, and flowering plants (Magnoliophyta).
In the length distribution dataset, introns without the
canonical "gt...ag" sequence were not weeded out. In all
organism groups, the second most abundant splice site
sequence was "gc...ag", comprising 0.58–1.14% of the
introns (higher in fungi than in the three other groups).
This is in agreement with earlier observations [10]. Intron
length distribution was calculated for introns with nonconsensus splice sites separately, and it was found that
many of them (up to 22.6% in vertebrates) were less than
5 nucleotides in length. In fact, these gaps in the coding
sequence probably do not represent introns, but programmed translational frameshifts [28].
In Figure 1, the cumulative distribution of intron lengths
in the four organism groups is shown. It is apparent that
the length distributions are very different for the four
groups. Introns shorter than 100 nt accounted for 86.9%
of the fungal introns, but only 11.3% of the vertebrate
introns. The non-cumulated distributions of intron
lengths are shown in Supplementary Figure S1 [see Additional file 1].
The curves in Figure 1 all have a linear domain. We
defined a minimum length cutoff by drawing a line
through the linear domain and extending it to the x-axis.
This yielded the following thresholds: vertebrates: 73 nt;
arthropods: 53 nt; fungi: 46 nt; and plants: 73 nt. These
values are in agreement with those of Goodall and Filipowicz [27].
Intron position statistics
The distributions of intron positions within the first 100
amino acid positions of eukaryotic genes from the GenBank sets are shown in Figure 2. In the plots of genes without signal peptides (the right half of the figure), it can be
seen that phase 0 introns are more frequent than phase 1
introns which are again more frequent than phase 2
introns, in agreement with what has been described
before [6,7]. The excess of phase 0 introns is particularly
pronounced in plant genes.

length cutoff.

For proteins with signal peptides (the left half of the figure), there is an excess of phase 1 introns in a region
around 20 for the two animal groups, and between 20 and
40 in plants. This has been described as corresponding to
the positions of the signal peptide cleavage sites [25,8], cf.
the Background section. The phase 1 excess cannot be
seen for the fungal sequences, where proteins with signal
peptides and introns are simply too rare to make this type
of statistics.
In proteins without signal peptides (the right half of the
figure), another phenomenon is seen: a sharp peak of
phase 0 introns at position 2, i.e. between the start codon
and codon 2. This is what we refer to as the start codon
introns. Note that there are no values for phase 0 introns at
position 1 – this would be introns occurring immediately
before the start codon, and those are not visible in the GenBank coding sequence ("CDS") features the data are
derived from (see Methods).
The peak of start codon introns is very high in vertebrates,
arthropods and fungi. In plants, it is not higher than the
peaks for phase 0 introns between positions 20 and 40,

but it is still conspicuous against the relatively intron-poor
region between positions 3 and 20.
Note that introns disrupting the start codon, i.e. phase 1
and phase 2 introns in position 1, are relatively rare, especially in plants.
In the genome data sets, both the phase 1 peak for proteins with signal peptides and the start codon peak for
proteins without signal peptides are clearly visible (see
Figure 3). The intron position distributions for the human
genome and the mouse genome look very similar to the
vertebrate GenBank set, and the Drosophila genome shows
the same pattern as the arthropod GenBank set.
Start codon introns have been briefly mentioned in the literature before, but only for human ribosomal proteins. In
a paper about the human ribosomal protein genes, Yoshihama et al. [29] remarked: "Interestingly, the ATG was
always located near the splice sites of the first intron and,
in 20 cases, was exactly at the 3' end of the first exon" (the
total number of genes analysed was 73).

Intron positions in the 100 most N-terminal amino acids of the coding sequence of genes in the Homo sapiens, Mus musculus,
and Drosophila melanogaster genomes. The data sets are not homology reduced.

The phenomenon is not limited to ribosomal proteins,
however. To address this question, we made plots of the
genome data sets without signal peptides with ribosomal
proteins removed (see Methods for details). These plots
are shown in Supplementary Figure S2 [see Additional file
1]. In the plots, there is only a slight lowering of the start
codon peak; the relative frequency being 0.0160 for
human, 0.0122 for mouse, and 0.0083 for fly (compare
these values with Figure 3); still well outside the range of
frequencies for other positions.
In arthropod genes with signal peptides, a peak of phase 0
introns is seen at position 5 (Figure 2). We checked the
GenBank annotation of these 20 proteins and found that
17 of them were from the genome sequence of Drosophila
melanogaster. Indeed, the same peak can be seen in the
non-homology reduced Drosophila genome (see Figure 3),

with the peak containing 88 proteins. A curious observation is that 18 of the 20 introns and 80 of the 88 introns
(90–91%) are the only introns in their respective genes;
for comparison, only 44.9% of all the D. melanogaster
genes with signal peptides have exactly one intron. The
functional annotation of the 88 peak proteins reveals a
striking fact: 38 of them (43%) are structural constituents
of cuticle (adult, larval or pupal). 46 have functional
annotation missing or "unknown," and only 4 have an
annotation of something other than cuticle. For comparison, only 2.8% of all the D. melanogaster genes with signal
peptides are annotated with "structural constituent ... cuticle."
In arthropods, fungi and plants without signal peptides, a
slight downward slope can be seen in the intron frequency. We tested whether this is a real 5' bias by comput-

ing the correlation coefficient between position and
relative frequency for positions 20 through 100. Fungi
and plants have significant (p < 1%, Pearson test) downward slopes for all three phases, arthropods only for phase
0 and phase 1. The vertebrate set shows no slope.

If the proteins are aligned by the stop codon instead of the
start codon, the picture shown in Figure 4 emerges. There
are no stop codon peaks, except for a weak phase 0 peak
before the last codon in plants without signal peptides.
For proteins with signal peptides, no special features can

be seen. Observe that it is only in proteins without signal
peptides that phase 0 introns are the most abundant. For
proteins without signal peptides, a slight reduction in the
intron frequency for all three phases can be seen in the last
approximately 20 positions (for fungi only approximately
5).
Proteins with start codon introns
In order to characterize the start codon introns, they were
compared to a background set. Both the start codon
introns and the background set were derived from proteins without signal peptides. To eliminate possible bias
from the fact that start codon introns are always phase 0
and always the first intron in the coding sequence (note:
this does not necessarily mean the first intron in the gene,
since there can be introns in the 5' untranslated region
(UTR)), the background set was limited to phase 0 introns
that were the first in the coding sequence.

A comparison of intron lengths was inconclusive. For vertebrates, start codon introns are slightly shorter than the
background set, but for fungi they are slightly longer. For
arthropods and plants, there are no significant differences
[see Supplementary Table S1 from Additional file 1].
When examining the nucleotide distribution, significant
differences are found for vertebrates, fungi, and plants (p
< 10-4, χ2-test, df = 3), but not for arthropods [see Supple-

mentary Table S1 from Additional file 1]. When using
nucleotide pair frequencies, significant differences are
found for all four groups (p < 10-3, χ2-test, df = 15) [see
Supplementary Table S1 from Additional file 1]. However,
the results show no clear trends – there are no dinucleotide preferences that are the same in all four organism
groups.
The sets of proteins without signal peptides carrying a start
codon intron were also subjected to further analysis, and
here, some interesting differences were found. Again, both
the positive and the negative set consisted of proteins
without signal peptides. The first thing we noticed was
that proteins with start codon introns are on average
shorter than other proteins, see Table 1. The differences
are significant on the 5% level for vertebrates and fungi,
and better than the 0.1% level for arthropods and plants
(Welch two sample t-test).
The amino acid distributions were also calculated, and it
was found that there are significant differences between
proteins with and without start codon introns for all
organism groups (p < 10-15, χ2-test, df = 19). The amino
acid frequencies are shown in Table 1. The most conspicuous differences, seen in all four organism groups, are that
lysine (K) is more abundant in proteins with start codon
introns than in other proteins, while serine (S) is less
abundant.

In order to assess the conservation of start codon intron
proteins, human genome proteins involved in a reciprocal
best hit (RBH – see Methods for definition) to mouse or
fly were compared. While human proteins with a start
codon intron on average have 91.5% identities in the global alignments with mouse, the other proteins have only
84.8% (Welch two sample t-test, p < 10-5). For the alignments of human versus Drosophila, the proteins with start
codon introns had 60.9% identities, while the others had
40.2% (two sample t-test, p < 10-15). Only RBHs where the
human gene was predicted not to contain a signal peptide
were included in these calculations.

Since ribosomal proteins can be expected to be more conserved than other proteins, we investigated whether the
higher conservation of proteins with start codon introns
could be solely due to the high proportion of ribosomal
proteins. The lists of RBHs were constrained to those
where the human protein description did not contain the
word "ribosomal," and the percent identities were compared again. The difference is still significant, although
smaller (human vs. mouse with/without start codon
introns: 89.6%/84.7%, two sample t-test, p < 1%; human
vs. fly with/without start codon introns: 57.7%/39.7%,
two sample t-test, p < 10-14).

We also tested whether start codon intron positions are
more conserved than other intron positions. All intron
positions were mapped onto the global alignments, and
in positions where the human protein had an intron it
was tested if the mouse or fly protein also had an intron.
In the comparison of human versus fly, there are 76 RBHs
with a human start codon intron. 45 had a corresponding
fly phase 0 intron, and 43 of these (56.6%) were also in a
start codon position. For comparison, only 2164 of the
16435 (13.2%) human phase 0 introns in other positions
are conserved in fly. This difference is highly significant (p
< 10-15, χ2-test, df = 1). In the comparison between human
and mouse, where the overall conservation of phase 0
intron positions is as high as 95.0%, no significant difference is seen.

Discussion

When looking at the functional annotations, a curious
observation was made: in the sets of proteins with start
codon introns, ribosomal proteins are overrepresented.
This, of course, corresponds well with the fact that ribosomal proteins was the first place where start codon
introns were observed. In the vertebrates, there are 16
ribosomal proteins out of the 55 start codon intron proteins, corresponding to 29%, while the background frequency in the non-start codon intron proteins without
signal peptides is 2.0%. In the plants, there are 12 out of
91 (13%) against a background frequency of 0.64%, and
in arthropods, there are 14 out of 44 (32%) against
2.98%. In fungi, there are only 4 ribosomal proteins out
of 45 in the start codon intron set, but the overrepresentation is still significant (p < 10-5, χ2-test, df = 1). The
descriptions of all start codon intron proteins from the
GenBank data sets can be seen in Supplementary Table S2
[see Additional file 1]. In the genome sets, we found the
same phenomenon: among human genes with start
codon introns, there are 12.6% proteins marked "ribosomal" against a background frequency of 1.6%; in mouse,
the frequencies are 15.1% against 1.3%, and in fly 15.5%
against 1.7%. These differences are highly significant (p <
10-15, χ2-test, df = 1).

When observing the start codon peak of introns in eukaryotic genes, the question naturally arose whether this was a
biological phenomenon or some kind of artifact of gene
finding. As mentioned in the description of the GenBank
data sets, we discarded genes where the evidence was
marked as "not experimental." However, we did not limit
the data set to genes marked "/evidence=experimental," as
this yielded too few genes to carry out the statistical analysis. The majority of genes do not have an "/evidence"
qualifier at all. The GenBank data may therefore contain
genes inferred by prediction.
In the whole-genome data, on the other hand, we discarded the genes solely based on prediction (those not
included in RefSeq) and here, the start codon peak was
still seen. This strongly suggests that the overabundance of
start codon introns is a biological phenomenon. Also, the
observation that proteins carrying a start codon intron
comprise a special class points in this direction. We have
shown that proteins with start codon introns are relatively
short, lysine-rich, serine-poor and evolutionarily conserved. In addition, we have shown that the start codon
intron positions are often conserved between human and
fly.
During the peer review process it was suggested that our
method for showing the excess of phase 0 introns after the
start codon could be questionable. The concern was that
that the method of aligning the first 100 aa of all protein
sequences, while showing the start codon peak, might fail
to detect some other peaks. The reason is that insertions
and deletions during evolution would alter the distance
between start codon and intron peak, thereby spreading
the peak over several positions. In other words, peaks in
other positions have been "diluted" over evolution while
the start codon peak is retained simply because we use the
start codon as "anchor point" for our alignment. This
"dilution effect" would be enhanced by the fact that the
N-terminal parts of proteins are often less conserved than
other parts, with many indels. The reviewer suggested that
we specifically analyzed proteins that have their N-termi-

nals conserved over evolution to avoid this suggested
effect.
We did this by selecting from the list of RBHs between
human and Drosophila those global alignments where neither the human nor the fly sequence had gaps within the
first 20 positions. This yielded 661 pairs, of which 582
human sequences and 599 fly sequences were predicted to
be without signal peptides. We then repeated the intron
position statistics for these sequences, and the result is
very clear: the phase 0 start codon peaks are even more
conspicuous than those in Figure 3 (reaching frequencies
of 0.062 for human and 0.053 for fly), and there are no
peaks in other positions [see Supplementary Figure S3
from Additional file 1].
Furthermore, the fact that we can still see the phase 1 signal peptide peak in our start codon alignments despite the
length variation of signal peptides suggests that the "dilution effect" does not completely wipe out peaks relatively
close to the N-terminus, but only makes them broader.
The reviewer suggested that the reason could be that proteins with signal peptides may have their N-terminals conserved over evolution, but this is not likely to be the case,
since signal peptides are known to evolve rapidly [30].
The function of the start codon intron may be to allow the
5' UTR to participate in exon shuffling, so that different
genes can exchange regulatory information. As described
in the Background section, phase 0 introns are often
found at the boundaries of evolutionary modules in proteins without signal peptides [22,26], and this effect is
stronger in phylogenetically old proteins [23]. This would
correspond quite well with the 5' UTR serving as an evolutionary module, separated from the protein coding
domain by a phase 0 intron at the start codon, especially
in well-conserved proteins.

the two nucleotides before the intron is "tg" instead of the
canonical "ag." However, the "a" is not very well conserved, and "t" is the next most common nucleotide in the
-2 position relative to the intron [12,18]. Also, in the evolutionarily conserved amino acids examined by Sverdlov
et al. [16] in order to reconstruct ancestral proto-splice
sites (see description in the Background section), Methionine was slightly overrepresented immediately before a
phase 0 intron. Consequently, the start codon could be
part of a proto-splice site if the first position of codon 2 is
a "g".
Indeed, "g" is enriched in position +4 (relative to the
translation start site) in eukaryotes [31]. However, this
enrichment is much higher in plants than in vertebrates or
Drosophila [32], so if this were to be the sole explanation
for start codon introns, we should expect a much stronger
start codon intron signal in plants than in animals, and
this is not the case (on the contrary, the signal is weaker in
plants, see Figure 2). On the other hand, the relatively
weak start codon intron signal in plants could be
explained within the proto-splice site model if there is a
much higher frequency of proto-splice sites in the plant
genes than in the vertebrate or arthropod genes as a
whole. We have not checked whether this is the case.
The 5' bias we observed in the position of introns within
the non-vertebrate genes is in contrast to Mourier and Jeffares [3], who reported that introns in multicellular
genomes are evenly distributed throughout genes. Our
fungal data set does contain unicellular organisms, but
arthropods and plants do not. On the other hand, Sakurai
et al. and Lin and Zhang [2,4] did find a 5' bias in virtually
all genomes studied. Interestingly, they even found 5' bias
in human and mouse, where we did not observe it.

If the start codon intron really is a boundary of an evolutionary module, one should expect that the second intron
would often be a phase 0 intron, too, since modules in
exon shuffling most often have introns of the same phase
in both ends [26]. We tried to investigate this by counting
the phases of the second introns in proteins where the first
intron was a start codon intron, compared with proteins
where the first intron was a phase 0 intron in another
position. In vertebrates and plants, there was indeed a tendency towards a higher proportion of second phase 0
introns for the start codon intron set, but it was not significant. In arthropods there was no difference, and in fungi
it was in fact lower (though not significantly).

The fact that ribosomal proteins are strongly overrepresented in start codon intron proteins is striking, because it
is an example of an intron position being conserved in a
functional class of proteins that are not related by descent
(the data sets were strictly homology reduced). To be
absolutely sure our homology reduction procedure had
not let any pairs of homologous sequences through, we
performed an all-versus-all global alignment of the
sequences with start codon introns in all the four GenBank organism groups. No pairs showed more than
28.5% identity in the global alignment. We also made
phylogenetic trees of the start codon intron sets and found
no clusters (the trees look just like stars). Plots of % identity versus alignment score and the trees can be seen in
Supplementary Figure S4, section 1 [see Additional file 1].

Another explanation for the start codon introns could be
that the nucleotide context of codons 1 and 2 provide a
proto-splice site. The codon before is necessarily "atg," so

Another example of this is the position 5 phase 0 peak in
Drosophila. Initially, we thought that it could be a gene
finding artifact, since it was specifically seen in one

genome. However, the extremely high proportion of cuticle constituents convinced us that this too is a biological
phenomenon. It is also not entirely unknown in the literature: Rondot et al. [33], while describing two larval-pupal
cuticle protein genes from the insect Tenebrio molitor,
found that both had a single intron within the signal peptide coding region (they do not write the exact location
and phase of those two introns, but from a figure in the
paper it can be inferred that they are indeed phase 0
introns, at positions 4 and 5). In addition to their own
observation, they remarked that such an intron localization (i.e. a single intron within the signal peptide region)
has been described in cuticle protein genes from many different species, including Drosophila. Again, note that this is
not simply a gene family with a conserved intron position,
since the peak is also seen in the heavily homologyreduced set. In order to test this further, we did an all-versus-all global alignment of the 20 sequences in the arthropod peak and found no pairs with more than 32.1%
identity [see Supplementary Figure S4, section 2, from
Additional file 1].

Conclusion
The start codon peak of phase 0 introns is so conspicuous
that it is quite remarkable that it has only been described
in a single sentence in the literature before. As mentioned
above, Yoshihama et al. [29] saw the phenomenon in
human ribosomal proteins, but to the best of our knowledge we are the first to provide a general investigation of
it. In this paper, we have filled this gap in the description
of intron positions in genes and argued that this phenomenon seems to be a biological reality and not simply an
artifact of gene finding or alignment.

Methods
GenBank data
Data sets were extracted from GenBank release 149.0 [34].
Vertebrate data were extracted from the GenBank divisions gbpri, gbrod, gbmam and gbvrt. Arthropod data
were taken from gbinv, while Fungi and flowering plants
(Magnoliophyta) were both found in gbpln. Observe that
Magnoliophyta comprises both monocots and dicots.

Information about introns in the sequences were taken
from "CDS" feature lines with a "join(...)" function in the
feature position. "CDS" features on the opposite strand,
marked by "complement(join(...))", were also parsed.
Before analysis, the GenBank entries went through a filtering process. Genes were skipped for the following reasons
(listed in the order the tests were applied): if the gene was
a pseudogene (indicated by the qualifier "/pseudo"); if the
gene was marked "/evidence=not_experimental"; if the
sequence was incomplete, indicated by ">" or "<" in the
positions; if the argument to "join" contained a cross-ref-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/256

erence to another entry (in this case, it was not possible to
assess the length of the intron); if the argument to "join"
contained "complement" (this was a rare occurrence that
we did not bother to parse); if the amino acid sequence
contained "X" (unknown amino acid) or "U" (selenocysteine); if the amino acid sequence lacked an initial
methionine; if the gene contained introns or exons of zero
or negative length; if there was an annotated "gap" feature
within the region of the "CDS" feature; or if the length of
the amino acid sequence did not match the length
inferred from the argument to "join".
At this point, the data were used for calculating intron
length statistics. After getting the results from that analysis, two more filtering steps were applied: genes with an
intron shorter than the found cutoff were skipped, as were
genes with introns that did not conform to the splice site
consensus "gt...ag".
Non-consensus splice sites are, as described in the Background section, known to exist, but they are rare. Burset et
al. [10] estimated that at least half the annotated noncanonical splice sites should be annotation errors. It
would be interesting to know whether "at...ac" introns follow the same positional distribution, but they are simply
too rare to make this kind of statistics.
The number of genes discarded for the various reasons can
be seen in Table 2. The script for GenBank parsing was
written in PERL.
Functional annotation of the proteins in the GenBank
data sets were extracted from GenBank by searching for
the "/product" qualifier. In general, the vertebrate set is
much more annotated than the other organism groups,
having a protein name in 74% of the "CDS" features. The
corresponding figures for fungi and plants are 40% and
19%. For arthropods, the situation is more complicated,
since functional annotation for Drosophila entries is often
not found in GenBank itself – the "/product" qualifier
contains a code such as "CG4111-PA" – but can be found
via cross-referencing to the NCBI Gene database, see
below. A protein sequence without a functional annotation can be marked in several different ways: by having no
"/product" qualifier, by having the value "unknown," or
by having the value "hypothetical protein" or "putative
protein."
The GenBank data sets are provided for download at our
website [35].

musculus) and fly (Drosophila melanogaster), was downloaded from NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology

Information) [36] in the following versions: Human:
Build 35; Mouse: Build 35; Fly: April 2005 build (contains
the annotation from FlyBase Release 4.1 and 3.2).
In all cases, the chromosomal GenBank format files were
parsed using the FeatureExtract software [37] to collect
both DNA sequence and Intron/Exon annotation for all
"CDS" regions.
For the human and mouse datasets, the following cleaning strategy was followed: Only genes whose proteinproduct is represented in the curated RefSeq database [38]
(name starts with "NP_") were kept, and all genes which
contained the phrases "translation discrepancy" and
"hypothetical protein" in the "CDS" feature note were discarded. For the Drosophila genome, all genes with ambiguous exon positions were removed, as were genes with
"codon_start" annotated to be 2 or 3.
Following the initial cleaning all genes were translated
using the Virtual Ribosome software [39] using the software's option of creating an annotation string describing

the phase and position of the underlying introns. Protein
sequences from genes with multiple in-frame stop-codons
were discarded. For all three genomes, alternative splicing
was handled simply by renaming each alternative spliced
transcript as "XXX_splic1", "XXX_splic2", etc.
After cleaning, the human genome set contained 13916
sequences, the mouse set 13957 sequences, and the fly set
19297 sequences.
Functional annotation (GO categories and descriptive
annotation) was derived directly from the "CDS" comments (with the "/product" qualifier) in the case of
human and mouse, and by cross-referencing the GeneID
to the NCBI Gene database [40] in the case of Drosophila.
For the results presented in Supplementary Figure S2 [see
Additional file 1], we removed ribosomal proteins by
skipping all entries where the comment (mouse and
human) or GO annotation (fly) contained the string
"ribosom" This removed 247 sequences from the human
set, 209 from the mouse set, and 290 from the fly set.

Finding the threshold for homology reduction: the cumulated score distribution is plotted in an extreme value plot, and the
threshold is set to the score value where the two lines intersect. Here shown for the vertebrate data set.

The whole-genome data sets are provided for download at
our website [35].
Homology reduction
Homology reduction of the GenBank data sets was carried
out in order to avoid gene families with conserved intron
positions showing up as peaks in the intron position
plots.

All the amino acid sequences in each data set were aligned
to each other using BLAST version 2.2.9 [41]. Filtering of
low-complexity sequences was turned off.
The threshold was found in the same way as for the translation initiation site dataset used in developing NetStart
[42]. Briefly, the BLAST score was plotted against an
inverse cumulated extreme value distribution: f(x) = ln(ln(1 - Pscore≥x)). Alignment scores for unrelated sequences
are expected to follow an extreme value distribution [43]
and so show up as a straight line in such a plot. The idea
is then to put the threshold where the plot deviates from
a straight line. In this case, the curve did not have a welldefined "kink" but rather smoothly arched away from the
straight line, so the cutoff was placed approximately

where a straight line drawn through the higher scores
crossed the straight line for lower scores, see Figure 5. This
yielded a threshold of 35 bits (BLAST score) for all four
data sets.
Note in Figure 5 that there is also a deviation from the
straight line for very low scores (<20). This is due to the
fact that the alignments were made using BLAST instead of
a full alignment of all sequences to each other. There are
fewer very low scores than expected because they simply
do not show up in the BLAST output.
After finding the threshold, the removal of homologous
sequences was carried out using algorithm 2 of Hobohm
et al. [44]. The cutoff of 35 in BLAST score corresponded
to 0.003–0.8 in E-value. This turned out to be a very stringent threshold, weeding out 71–79% of the sequences.
The numbers of genes retained after homology reduction
are given in Table 2.
To further ensure that no protein families have escaped
our homology reduction, we analyzed the sequences in
the start codon peaks and the arthropod position 5 peak
in the following way: For each dataset, all protein

sequences were pairwise globally aligned against the rest
of the set using the "align" program from the FASTA package [45], and alignment score and percent idendity were
plotted. Furthermore, we used ClustalW [46] to construct
a "phylogenetic" tree based on pairwise distances (ClustalW's guide-tree), and visualized the relationship by plotting the tree with "unrooted" [47]. These results are shown
in Supplementary Figure S4 [see Additional file 1].

The whole-genome data were not homology reduced.
Signal peptide prediction
Signal peptide prediction was done with SignalP v. 3.0
[48]. Sequences were placed in the categories according to
the D-score of SignalP-NN and the prediction of SignalPHMM. In cases where SignalP-NN and SignalP-HMM did
not agree, the sequence was disregarded. The numbers of
proteins predicted to be with and without signal peptides
can be seen in Table 2.
Reciprocal Best Hits
Conservation of proteins were investigated using the
whole-genome sets. All human sequences were aligned to
all mouse and fruit fly sequences using BLAST [41]. For
each human gene, the best hit in the database of mouse or
fly was saved, and vice versa. If the best hit for gene A in
human was gene B in mouse or fly, and the best hit for
gene B simultaneously was gene A, a Reciprocal Best Hit
(RBH) between gene A and gene B was recorded. 8089
RBHs were found between human and mouse, and 4223
between human and fly. The pairs of proteins involved in
each RBH were then globally aligned using the program
"align" from the FASTA package [45] in order to calculate
the overall percent identity and investigate whether intron
positions were conserved.
Statistical tests
Statistical tests were done in R [49]. When doing χ2-tests,
Yates' continuity correction was used for 2-by-2 contingency tables. Two-sample t-tests were always preceded by
an F-test to compare the two variances; if the variances
were significantly unequal, Welch test was used.
