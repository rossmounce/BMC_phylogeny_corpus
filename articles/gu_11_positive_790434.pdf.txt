and its effect on vaccine efficacy

Abstract
Background: To investigate the relationship between the selective pressure and the sequence variation of the
hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) protein, we performed the positive selection analysis by estimating the ratio of
non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions with 132 complete HN gene sequences of Newcastle disease
viruses (NDVs) isolated in China.
Results: The PAML software applying a maximum likelihood method was used for the analysis and three sites
(residues 266, 347 and 540) in the HN protein were identified as being under positive selection. Codon 347 was
located exactly in a recognized antigenic determinant (residues 345-353) and codon 266 in a predicted linear B-cell
epitope. Substitutions at codon 540 contributed to the N-linked glycosylation potential of residue 538. To further
evaluate the effect of positively selected sites on the vaccine efficacy, we constructed two recombinant fowlpox
viruses rFPV-JS6HN and rFPV-LaSHN, expressing the HN proteins from a genotype VII field isolate Go/JS6/05 (with
A266, K347 and A540) and vaccine strain La Sota (with V266, E347 and T540), respectively. Two groups of SPF
chickens, 18 each, were vaccinated with the two recombinant fowlpox viruses and challenged by Go/JS6/05 at 3
weeks post-immunization. The results showed that rFPV-JS6HN could elicit more effective immunity against the
prevalent virus infection than rFPV-LaSHN in terms of reducing virus shedding.
Conclusions: The analysis of positively selected codons and their effect on the vaccine efficacy indicated that the
selective pressure on the HN protein can induce antigenic variation, and new vaccine to control the current ND
epidemics should be developed.

Background
Newcastle disease (ND) is notorious for its devastations to
the world poultry industry and listed as one of the notifiable terrestrial animal diseases by the World Organization
for Animal Health (Office International des Epizooties).
The causative agent, Newcastle disease virus (NDV), also
known as avian paramyxovirus serotype 1, is a member of
the family Paramyxoviridae [1]. The virus genome is a
non-segmented, single-strand, negative sense RNA which
codes for six major proteins including nucleocapsid protein (NP), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), fusion
protein (F), hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN), and large
RNA-directed RNA polymerase (L), in the order from the

3’ to 5’ terminus [2]. Since its emergence in fowls in 1926,
NDV has undergone substantial genetic evolution and has
developed into several distinct genotypes (I to IX) [3,4].
Among these, genotype VII is considered to be responsible
for the severe outbreaks in Western Europe [5], South
Africa and Southern Europe [3], and East Asia [6,7] in the
1990s. Presently, the genotype VII NDV is still prevalent
in China [4,8-10].
Although the cleavability of F protein is pivotal to
NDV pathogenicity [11,12], recent studies have shown
that HN protein also contributes to tissue tropism and
virulence [13]. HN is an important immunoprotective
glycoprotein on the envelope of ND virions and responsible for essential viral functions, such as binding to sialic acid-containing cell receptors, facilitating the fusion
activity of the F protein and removing sialic acid to
release progeny virus particles [14]. Despite the critical

role that HN protein plays in NDV immunity and
pathogenesis, the positive selection pressure acting on
HN during the viral evolution has not been well
analyzed.
The ratio of non-synonymous (d N ) to synonymous
(d S ) substitutions (ω = d N /d S ) provides an important
means for studying the selective pressure at the protein
level, with ω = 1 denoting neutral mutations, ω < 1 purifying selection, and ω > 1 diversifying positive selection.
As a high proportion of amino acids in many proteins is
often largely invariable (with ω close to 0) due to strong
structural and functional constraints, approaches conferring an average ω over all codons across the gene are
not sensitive enough to detect positive selection [15].
The program PAML [16,17], which applies a maximum
likelihood (ML) criterion and a few simple models
allowing for heterogeneous ω ratios among sites, has
been considered an efficient integrated method to estimate positive selection and has been commonly used to
study virus evolution [18-21]. In this paper, the selective
pressure on NDV HN protein was examined using 132
complete HN sequences (Chinese isolates), including
106 retrieved from GenBank (up to 14 April, 2009) and
the other 26 obtained from field isolates. Based on the
analysis, three codons of HN were identified under positive selection and their potential effect on the routine
vaccine efficacy was then evaluated.

Materials and methods
Viruses

Four pigeon isolates: NDV03-018, NDV03-044, NDV05028 and NDV05-029 [22], were kindly provided by Dr.
Zhiliang Wang (China Animal Health and Epidemiology
Center). Two chicken isolates, QH-1/79 and QH-4/85
[23], were obtained from Dr. Dianjun Cao (Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural
Sciences). Twenty field strains were isolated from diseased
chicken and goose flocks in China during 2005-2006. All
of these viruses were subjected to three rounds of plaquepurification in chick embryo fibroblast (CEF) monolayers
and subsequently propagated in 10-day-old specific pathogen free (SPF) chicken embryos. Infective allantoic fluid
containing virus stocks was aliquoted and stored at -80°C
before use.
RNA preparation, PCR, and sequencing

Viral RNAs were extracted directly from the allantoic
fluid with the Trizol LS reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Reverse
transcription (RT) was conducted with random primers,
and PCR was performed with a pair of primers (sense:
5’-CTTCACAACATCCGTTCTACC-3’, antisense: 5’ACCTTCCGAGTTTTATCATTCT-3’) to amplify the

full-length HN gene of NDV. The PCR products were
purified with a DNA purification kit (QIAGEN, Hilden,
Germany) and sequenced directly using the ABI PRISM
BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
Sequence information and phylogenetic analysis

GenBank accession numbers assigned to the 26 strains
characterized in the present study were as follows:
FJ751918, FJ751919, FJ766528, EF666110, GQ338309GQ338311, and EU044809-EU044827. In addition, the
other 106 full-length HN sequences of NDV isolates from
China (vaccine strains of La Sota and Mukteswar were
included as they are used extensively in poultry flocks,
while recombinant strains were excluded to ensure the
accuracy of detecting positive selection at amino acid sites
[24]) were retrieved directly from GenBank and their
accession numbers were listed in Table 1. All the 132 HN
sequences were edited and aligned with the Lasergene
software (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI). The GTR (general time reversible) + I (invariable sites) + G (gamma distribution) evolutionary model was selected as the optimal
nucleotide substitution model with the program Modeltest
3.7 [25]. Phylogenetic tree was then constructed by
employing the ML method implemented in PAUP*
version 4.0b [26] and neighbor-joining (NJ) method in
MEGA version 4.0 [27]. The robustness of the statistical
support for the tree branch was evaluated by 1000 bootstrap replicates. The online server, BepiPred 1.0 [28], was
used to predict the position of linear B-cell epitopes of all
the HN sequences.
Positive selection detection

To estimate the selective constraints on the HN protein,
the codeml program of the PAML package (version 4)
[16] was utilized to calculate the site-to-site variation in
ω. Two nested site-specific models, consisting of a neutral model that does not allow positive selection (ω≤1)
and an alternative model that permits positive selection
(ω > 1), were compared. As recommended [15], the following models were used: M0 (one-ratio) v. M3 (discrete) and M7 (beta) v. M8 (beta & ω). M0 assumes a
constant ω for all codons whereas M3 allows for discrete classes of sites with different ω ratios. M7 supposes a beta distribution with 10 categories of ω over
sites, each corresponding to a unique ω value that is
always less than 1 while M8 has an extra category with
ω > 1. Then the log likelihood values for each pair of
the above nested models were compared by a likelihood
ratio test (LRT) [15,17], in order to assess whether the
model allowing for positive selection is significantly
more suitable for the data. Finally, the Bayes empirical
Bayes (BEB) procedure [29] was used to infer the

Animal experiment

To further investigate the effect of positively selected
sites on vaccine efficacy against the prevalent NDVs,
Go/JS6/05 (field NDV strain) and La Sota (the most
widely used vaccine strain in China) were chosen to
construct corresponding recombinant fowlpox viruses
(rFPVs) expressing each HN gene based on the transfer
vector pP12LS developed by Sun et al [30]. The expression was identified by indirect immunofluorescence
assay (IFA) in secondary CEF cultures using anti-NDV
polyclonal antibody as previously described [31], and the
levels of HN expression were further compared between
the two generated rFPVs by flow cytometry [32] on DF1 cells (a stable cell line of CEF) at a multiplicity of
infection (MOI) of 5. Subsequently, two groups of fiveday-old SPF White Leghorn chickens (18 birds/group,
Beijing Merial Vital Laboratory Animal Technology,
Beijing, China) were immunized respectively with the
above two rFPVs at a dose of 1 × 10 4 PFU. A third
group was served as a mock-vaccinated control. Three
weeks later, all chickens were challenged oculonasally
with 100 μL of PBS-diluted allantoic fluid containing
1 × 105 EID50 of Go/JS6/05. Tracheal and cloacal swabs
were collected on days 3, 5 and 7 post-challenge (p.c.).
Furthermore, six chickens from each vaccinated group
were sacrificed humanely on day 5 p.c., and tissue samples including liver, brain, spleen, kidney, trachea and
lung were collected. The swabs were immersed in PBS
with antibiotics (8000 U/mL ampicilin, 5 mg/mL streptomycin and kanamycin, pH 7.2), and stored at -80°C
until analyzed. The recovery of the challenged virus in
these swabs or organ samples was confirmed by inoculation into embryonated chicken eggs. All animal work
was approved by the Jiangsu Administrative Committee
for Laboratory Animals (Permission number: SYXK-SU2007-0005).

Results
Sequence analysis

The full coding region of the 132 HN genes analyzed in
this study exhibited diverse phylogenetic phenotypes in
Chinese poultry flocks, containing six of the nine recognized genotypes (II, III, VI, VII, VIII and IX), with the
overwhelming majority (113/132) belonged to genotype
VII (Additional file 1, Table S1). In addition, the phylogenetic tree (Figure 1) showed that our 26 sequences
belonged to four different genotypes as follows: III (Ch/
JS7/05 and Go/JS9/05), VI (NDV05-028 and NDV05029), VIII (QH-1/79 and QH-4/85) and the remaining
20 fell into genotype VII.
Detection of positive selection

An ML method implemented in the software package
PAML was used for the identification of any positive
selection on the HN protein of NDV. The log likelihood
differences between M0 and M3, as well as M7 and M8
were found to be significant. Models that permitted positive selection showed a better fit to the data and contained a class of codons with the non-synonymous to
synonymous substitutions ratio greater than one (ω > 1),
indicating the existence of positive selection (Table 2).
A further analysis on the amino acids most likely responsible for the detected non-neutral pattern revealed that
three codons, 266, 347 and 540, were under positive
selection identified by both M3 and M8, with the posterior probability over 95% for residue 266 and 347, and
over 90% for residue 540. As the M0-M3 comparison is
more a test of heterogeneity in the ω value among sites
and not actually a test of positive selection [33], only the
results obtained by M8 were investigated further.
Amino acid variations of positively selected codons

As shown in Table 3, each of the three positively
selected codons identified by M8 exhibited diversity in
amino acid substitutions which could induce the variations in hydrophobicity or charge. In particular, codon

266 contained the most abundant amino acid substitutions. According to program BepiPred 1.0, a fragment of
the HN sequence covering residues 255 to 265, sometimes extending to residue 267 or even 270, was
detected as a potential B-cell epitope. And codon 266
was involved in the above predicted epitope of 119 HN
sequences, including all the 113 genotype VII viruses
(Additional file 1, Table S1).
Generation of rFPVs expressing HN genes

Two rFPVs, rFPV-LaSHN and rFPV-JS6HN respectively
expressing the HN proteins of vaccine strain La Sota
(with V266, E347 and T540) and genotype VII field isolate JS-06/05 (with A266, K347 and A540) were generated by homologous recombination between the
corresponding transfer plasmid and the wild-type parental FPV. Fluorescence was readily observed in CEF cells
transfected with either rFPV-LaSHN (Figure 2A) or

rFPV-JS6HN (Figure 2B), demonstrating the expression
of the inserted HN gene. The flow cytometric analysis
indicated that there was no significant difference in the
expression levels of HN between rFPV-LaSHN and
rFPV-JS6HN on DF-1 cells at 24 hours post-infection
(data not shown).
Protective efficacies of rFPV-JS6HN and rFPV-LaSHN

On day 21 after immunization, effective antibody responses
were induced in both rFPV vaccinated groups, with higher
hemagglutinin-inhibition (HI) titers to the homologous
antigen, and serum from birds inoculated with rFPVLaSHN reacted poorly with Go/JS6/05 (Table 4). On day 5
p.c., virus replication in different visceral organs of rFPVJS6HN or rFPV-LaSHN vaccinated chickens was examined
by inoculation into 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs.
As shown in Table 4, the frequencies of virus isolation in

higher than that of the rFPV-JS6HN, though no statistically
significant difference was observed.
Each of the rFPV-JS6HN and rFPV-LaSHN vaccinated
chickens was fully protected against mortality after challenge, whereas unvaccinated birds died within 5 days
p.c.. On day 3 p.c., virus shedding from the cloaca and
trachea showed that both the rFPV vaccines remarkably
decreased the level of virus excretion from cloaca, and
that the rFPV-JS6HN group could significantly reduce
the virus recovery rates from trachea when compared
with the rFPV-LaSHN group. Moreover, on days 5 and
7 p.c., the frequencies of virus isolation from cloaca in
rFPV-JS6HN vaccinated birds were much lower than
that in rFPV-LaSHN immunized fowls (Table 5).

Discussion
Positive selection is an evolutionary process that could
drive the fixation of emerging advantageous mutations
in the population with higher frequencies compared to
the wild-type allele [34]. Therefore, identifying proteins
or protein domains that experiencing adaptive selection
will improve the understanding of their genomic functions and the recognition of genetic variation that leads
to phenotypic diversity [35].
Observations from previous genetic and antigenic studies of viruses such as FMDV (foot-and-mouth disease
virus) [18], HIV-1 (human immunodeficiency virus type 1)
[19], RHDV (rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus) [20] and
influenza B virus [21], have indicated that signatures of
positive selection are generally functionally important and/
or associated with antigenicity. To date, seven antigenic
determinants that form a continuum on HN protein have
been characterized by a panel of monoclonal antibodies

(mAbs) against the HN of the velogenic AustraliaVictoria/32 (AV) strain, including the amino acids positions 193, 194, 201, 263, 287, 321, 332, 333, 345, 347, 350,
353, 356, 494, 513, 514, 516, 521 and 569 [36,37]. One of
our positively selected sites, codon 347, was located exactly
in those defined epitopes. In the present study, both La
Sota and Mukteswar, which are widely used vaccine
strains in China, have a glutamic acid (E) occupied codon
347, in contrast to that with a lysine (K) substitution
resulting in the opposite residual charge exclusively in
genotype VII viruses (accession numbers in italic in Table
1). Furthermore, as referred to recent work of Cho et al
[38] and Hu et al (2009) [39], it is reasonable to postulate
that the emergence of E347K substitution might be closely
related to the host immune pressure. However, the codon
266 was not included in the aforementioned antigenic
sites [36,37], instead, it was involved in a predicted linear
B-cell epitope that simultaneously held the epitope residue
263, suggesting that site 266 may lie in some antigenic
regions yet to be recognized.
N-linked glycosylation, one of the most common forms
of protein post-translational modifications, is known to
be correlated with viral infectivity and immune escape
[40]. There are six potential N-glycosylation sites (amino
acids 119, 341, 433, 481, 508 and 538) in the HN protein
of the AV strain [41]. In our analysis, positive selection
was detected at codon 540, which comprised three different amino acids: alanine (A), valine (V) and threonine
(T). Residue 538 was conserved with asparagine (N) in
all the 132 HN sequences and tended to be a putative Nglycosylation site if T was present at site 540. However,
the vast majority of prevalent strains owned A or V at
codon 540 (Additional file 1, Table S1), which would

deprive the possibility of N538 being glycosylated. The
exact function of the resulted deglycosylation at site 540
remains unknown and needs to be further explored.
Compared to vaccine strain La Sota, most genotype
VII NDV isolates possessed different amino acids at the
three identified positively selected sites. To further evaluate the effect of those sites on the vaccine protective
efficacy, Go/JS6/05 was chosen together with La Sota
for the recombinant fowlpox-virus construction. Before
challenge, serum collected from the rFPV-LaSHN
immunized chickens displayed lower HI titers to Go/
JS6/05 than to La Sota (Table 4), which may suggest
that substitutions at the positively selected sites are partially responsible for the antigenic variation between the
two HN proteins. After challenge, virus shedding results
showed that the rFPV-JS6HN could prevent the excretion of the challenged virus more efficiently than rFPVLaSHN, indicating that the positively selected sites on
the HN protein could affect the vaccine immune efficacy
against the prevalent NDV infection.
Although an intensive vaccination program against ND
has been executed in China in the last few decades, epidemic infections with velogenic genotype VII NDV in
vaccinated birds are still frequently reported in recent
years [4,8-10]. Currently, the most extensively used vaccine strains, such as La Sota (genotype II) and Mukteswar
(genotype III), were isolated and characterized in the
1940s and belonged to the “early” genotypes (I-IV and
IX), which have evident amino acid sequence divergence
from the “late” ones (V-VII), especially genotype VII [42].
The results in this study suggest that positive selection
may play a role in the formation of such differentiation
and even induce antigenic variations compared with the
vaccine strains. Therefore, new vaccine to better control
the ND epizootics of prevalent NDV strains carrying
novel variations at identified positively selected sites
should be developed to meet the challenge.
