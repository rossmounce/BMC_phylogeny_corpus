Abstract
Background: Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are a large family of proteins that function in a variety of key
regulatory pathways in eukaryotic cells, including control over the cell cycle and gene transcription. Among the
most important and broadly studied of these roles is reversible phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD)
of RNA polymerase II, part of a complex array of CTD/protein interactions that coordinate the RNAP II
transcription cycle. The RNAP CTD is strongly conserved in some groups of eukaryotes, but highly degenerate
or absent in others; the reasons for these differences in stabilizing selection on CTD structure are not clear. Given
the importance of reversible phosphorylation for CTD-based transcription, the distribution and evolutionary
history of CDKs may be a key to understanding differences in constraints on CTD structure; however, the origins
and evolutionary relationships of CTD kinases have not been investigated thoroughly. Moreover, although the
functions of most CDKs are reasonably well studied in mammals and yeasts, very little is known from most other
eukaryotes.
Results: Here we identify 123 CDK family members from animals, plants, yeasts, and four protists from which
genome sequences have been completed, and 10 additional CDKs from incomplete genome sequences of
organisms with known CTD sequences. Comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses suggest that cell-cycle
CDKs are present in all organisms sampled in this study. In contrast, no clear orthologs of transcription-related
CDKs are identified in the most putatively ancestral eukaryotes, Trypanosoma or Giardia. Kinases involved in CTD
phosphorylation, CDK7, CDK8 and CDK9, all are recovered as well-supported and distinct orthologous families,
but their relationships to each other and other CDKs are not well-resolved. Significantly, clear orthologs of CDK7
and CDK8 are restricted to only those organisms belonging to groups in which the RNAP II CTD is strongly
conserved.
Conclusions: The apparent origins of CDK7 and CDK8, or at least their conservation as clearly recognizable
orthologous families, correlate with strong stabilizing selection on RNAP II CTD structure. This suggests coevolution of the CTD and these CTD-directed CDKs. This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that
CDK7 and CDK8 originated at about the same time that the CTD was canalized as the staging platform RNAP II
transcription. Alternatively, extensive CTD phosphorylation may occur in only a subset of eukaryotes and, when
present, this interaction results in greater stabilizing selection on both CTD and CDK sequences. Overall, our
results suggest that transcription-related kinases originated after cell-cycle related CDKs, and became more
evolutionarily and functionally diverse as transcriptional complexity increased.

Background
Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) belong to a large protein family with 13 members described so far in human
cells including CDKs1-11, along with PCTAIRE and
PFTAIRE kinases named after conserved domain
sequences [1]. These kinases are essential for cell cycle
progression, and also are involved in control of transcription, DNA repair and post-mitotic cellular process [2-4].
Generally, CDKs1-6, PCTAIRE and PFTAIRE have been
linked to cell cycle regulation, and CDKs7, 8 and 9 to control of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) transcription [4-8].
The functions of CDKs10 and 11 have not been defined
clearly, but recent research implicates them in coordination of transcription and RNA-processing [9-13].
Among the most important and broadly studied roles of
CDKs in transcription is the reversible phosphorylation of
the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit
(RPB1) of RNAP II. The CTD consists of multiple repeats
of an evolutionarily conserved heptapeptide with the consensus sequence Tyr1-Ser2-Pro3-Thr4-Ser5-Pro6-Ser7 [14].
The number of repeats varies among different organisms,
ranging from 26–27 in yeast to 52 in mammals [15,16]
with 8 repeats in yeast and 28 repeats in human cells
required for viability [15,17,18]. Both biochemical and
genetic evidence places the CTD in a central position in
the 'mRNA factory,' where it functions as a platform for
interactions with processing factors and other transcription-related proteins [19,20]. More than a passive scaffold, reversible phosphorylation of the CTD regulates the
cycling of RNAP II between a hypophosphorylated (IIO)
form, which is competent to enter the preinitiation complex, and a hyperphosphorylated (IIA) form capable of
processive transcript elongation [21]. Throughout this
cycle the CTD binds essential transcription-related proteins that help to regulate gene expression, promote efficient elongation, and effectively couple transcription to
pre-mRNA processing [19-24].
To date at least five of the CDKs (CDK1, 2, 7, 8 and 9)
have been shown to phosphorylate the CTD in vitro; they
all have been referred to as 'CTD kinases' [25-28]. Both
CDK7 and CDK8 are found tightly associated with the
pre-initiation complex and are involved in transcriptional
regulation [29]. The CDK9 subunit of P-TEFb (positive
transcription elongation factor b) induces hyper-phosphorylation of the CTD and stimulates elongation. Unlike
CDKs 7, 8 and 9, which have demonstrated interactions
with the CTD in vivo, CDK1 and CDK2 are primarily cellcycle related kinases [4]. CDK2 has been characterized
functionally only human and Drosophila in mammals and
its role in Tat-dependent HIV-1 transcription is still
unclear [27,28]. Although phosphorylation of yeast RNAP
II by CDK1 (CDC2) can inhibit transcription in vitro, the
role of the CDK1 in mRNA synthesis in vivo is not, as yet,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/69

clearly understood. It has been proposed as a candidate
for mitotic RNAP II inactivation by inhibition of CDK7
CTD-kinase activity [26].
In animals and yeasts, interactions between the CTD and
CTD-specific kinases have become a focal point of biochemical and genetic investigations of RNAP II transcription and transcription-linked mRNA processing
[25,26,30]. However, the ancestry and evolutionary relationships among CTD kinases have not been investigated
thoroughly. Evolutionary analyses of the RNAP II CTD
show that canonical CTD heptads are strongly conserved
only in a subset of eukaryotic groups. In evolutionary trees
based on RPB1 sequences, all eukaryotic groups in which
the CTD is strongly conserved appear to be descended
from a single common ancestor (descendents of this
ancestor have been referred to as the "CTD-clade") [31].
The reasons for differential conservation of the CTD have
not been clarified, nor have evolutionary correlations
been established between strong conservation of CTD
structure and the presence of essential CTD/protein interactions. In addition, although the functions of various
CDKs are reasonably well characterized in mammals and
yeasts, very little is known for most other eukaryotes, and
the overall evolution of CDKs has been investigated only
in animals and yeasts [32]. Therefore, a comparative evolutionary study also can provide clues as to which CDK
orthologs, and presumably CDK functions, are present
over a broad range of eukaryotic diversity.
Here we present a comparative genomic analysis of CDKs,
using complete genomes from members of the "CTD
clade" (animals, plants, yeasts and Microsporidia), as well
as from other diverse eukaryotic organisms lacking a
canonical CTD (Trypanosoma, Plasmodium and Giardia), to
explore the evolutionary relationships between the CTD
and CTD kinases. We also provide a phylogenetic distribution of CDKs from a wide range of organisms, suggesting new hypotheses regarding the emergence and
evolution of different members of the CDK family.

Results
We identified 133 CDK family members, 123 from animals, plants, yeasts, and four protists from which genome
sequences have been completed, and 10 additional CDKs
from incomplete genome sequences of organisms with
known CTD sequences (Table 1). Although all of
sequences are included in our supplemental phylogenetic
analysis (additional file 1), only 101 of them are included
in the major phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1); a large plantspecific amplification of CDK9-like kinases (the phylogenetic weight of these sequences disrupts the CDK9 subclade) and sequences from incomplete genomes are
excluded (see Fig. 1 and additional file 1 legends for further explanation). The nomenclature for kinases from

Note: The sequences in bold are the additional sequences from incomplete genomes and uncharacterized CDK9 like-kinases from Arabidopsis and
Oryza included in supplemental phylogenetic tree (additional file 1).

Arabidopsis followed Joubès et al. (2000) and Vandepoele
et al. (2002) [33,34] (Table 1). The catalytic core base,
Gly-rich motif and T-loop, required for characterized CDK
function, appear to be conserved across all defined and
putative kinase sequences analyzed (additional file 2).
The 50% majority rule consensus tree of 4,000 likelihood
trees, sampled from the posterior probability distribution
from Bayesian phylogenetic inference, is shown in Figure
1. This tree provides strong support for grouping a
number of previously uncharacterized CDKs, from a variety of organisms, with defined CDKs from animals and
yeast. Overall, however, very little support is found for
relationships among different CDK orthologous groups.
In this unrooted tree the highly diversified cell-cycle
kinases defined in humans, CDKs1-6, fall into a large cluster with 69% Bayesian support. This grouping includes
CDKs from all organisms examined in the study. Among
these putative cell-cycle CDKs, some plant and protistan
kinases can be assigned with reasonable confidence to
specific CDK groups. For example, apparent orthologs of
human CDK1 are found in other animals (Drosophila and
Caenorhabditis), yeasts, both plants (Arabidopsis and
Oryza), Encephalitozoon and Giardia (Fig. 1). Likewise,
putative orthologs of CDK5 were identified in all organisms examined, except for the two plants (Fig. 1). A
number of other sequences, such as TbCrk2 and 3 from
Trypanosoma, cluster with cell-cycle kinases but not clearly
with any specific CDK family. Significantly, and consistent with the results of Liu and Kipreos (2000) [32], CDK5
and PCTAIRE-like kinases from fungi and animals form a
strongly supported group, indicating their close relationship (Fig. 1).
In contrast to cell-cycle kinases, our phylogenetic results
failed to identify a clear ortholog of any transcriptionrelated CDKs from two of the complete genomes exam-

ined, Trypanosoma brucei and Giardia lamblia. This includes
strongly supported clades of presumed orthologs of
human CDKs7-11 respectively. A well-defined CDK7 family is recovered, including sequences from yeasts, the
microsporidian, plants, and animals. These are the primary groups that make up the "CTD-clade," in which the
RNAP II CTD is invariably conserved (Fig. 2). CDK7
shows an interesting sister relationship to HsCCRK from
human and apparent orthologs from Drosophila, Caeorhabditis and Arabidopsis. In Arabidopsis, four possible
CDK7 orthologs were found, as reported previously by
Shimotohno and colleagues (2003) [35]; however,
AtCdkF (CAK1) is quite divergent from the core CDK7
family and related specifically to HsCCRK in our analyses.
PfMRK from Plasmodium, suggested previously to be a
CDK7 [36], does not fall within the well-defined CDK7
group, but clusters with another Plasmodium kinase. The a
priori hypothesis that PfMRK belongs in the core CDK7
group is strongly rejected with our data set in a likelihood
paired-sites test.
Likewise, GlCAKlike (gi: 292497120) has been proposed
as a CDK7 from Giardia, based on nearest sequence similarity to Kin28 in a more limited comparison to CDK
sequences from fission yeast [38]. In our expanded analyses of CDKs from 11 completed genomes, we find no evidence supporting an orthologous relationship to CDK7
for this, or any Giardia sequence. The a priori hypothesis
that GlCAKlike belongs in the core CDK7 group also is
strongly rejected in a likelihood paired-sites test.
A robust CDK8 family is recovered with strong support
values in both distance bootstrap and Bayesian inference.
Like CDK7, this family includes putative orthologs only
from members of the "CTD-clade," specifically yeasts, animals and plants. Although the microsporidian Encephalitozoon is a member of the RNAP II "CTD clade," TBlastN

this analysis to determine whether identified plant CDK9s show a specific phylogenetic affinity to either the BUR1 or CTK1
subgroup. All identified plant sequences are included in an expanded analysis shown in additional file 1.

The tree displayed, after Stiller and Cook [60] had the highest likelihood of all trees sampled from the posterior probability distribution in 106 generations of Bayesian inference. Organisms with genomes included in this study are in larger/bold font, and
whether each of the three primary CTD kinases (CDKs7,8,9) are present in this genome, as inferred from global phylogenetic
analyses and distributions of CDK kinases (see Fig. 1), are indicated next to the name. Names in blue indicate the presence of
repeated heptads at the RPB1 C-terminus, which includes several from protistan organisms that do not conform to the consensus sequence or known structural requirements of the canonical CTD [60]; names in red have no tandem-heptapeptide
structure whatsoever. The node supporting a "CTD-clade," in which the consensus sequence and repetitive structure of the
CTD are invariably conserved, occurred in 98% of the 8000 trees sampled from the Bayesian posterior probability distribution.
See references 31 and 60 for a more complete phylogenetic treatment of the origin and conservation of the CTD.

searches of the complete genome of Encephalitozoon found
six CDKs but none show a phylogenetic affinity to CDK8.
A CDK9 grouping also is supported as monophyletic with
representative CDKs from yeasts, Encephalitozoon, animals, plants and Plasmodium. This group is divided into
two well-defined sub-clades. One of them consists of
BUR1 from yeast along with CDK9 orthologs from animals; the other contains CTK1 from yeast, CDC2L5 and
CrkRS from human, and apparent orthologs from Drosophila and Caenorhabditis, both plants, and Plasmodium. A

putative CDK9 also is found in Encephalitozoon, but falls at
the base of the larger CDK9 grouping and does not associate clearly with either subgroup (Fig. 1). Plants also contain a large number of putative CDKs that show strong
phylogenetic affinity to CDK9 (additional file 1). These
kinases appear to represent a plant-specific amplification
of CDK9, although their functions have not been determined experimentally.

PfCRK1 from Plasmodium. Once again, no kinases from
either Trypanosoma or Giardia show any phylogenetic
affinity to this group.

Discussion
A suggestion of co-evolution between the RNAP II CTD
and CTD kinases
At least five CDKs have the capacity to phosphorylate
RNAP II CTD repeats in vitro or in vivo [25-28]. Kinases
that appear to be related closely to CDK1, which can
phosphorylate the CTD in vitro, are present in all organisms sampled; however, it is not clear that CDK1 interacts
with the CTD in vivo or is essential for CTD function.
CDK2 was found only in human and Drosophila and,
based on our analyses from a diverse group of eukaryotes,
appears to be derived from within a larger CDK1 family.
In any case, according to its restricted phylogenetic distribution, possible CTD/CDK2 interactions cannot explain
the conservation of CTD structure in diverse members of
the "CTD-clade."

Evolutionary investigations of RPB1 sequences show that
canonical CTD heptads are conserved strongly in only a
subset of eukaryotic groups, all apparently descended
from a single common ancestor [31]. This "CTD-clade" is
composed of animals, plants, fungi, and related protistan
groups, including microsporidians, chytridiomycetes,
choanoflagellates and slime molds (Fig. 2). A handful of
organisms that do not fall inside the "CTD-clade" do have
tandemly repeated C-terminal heptads. For example,
RPB1 from Plasmodium falciparum contains a short set of
seven tandem C-terminal repeats. Based on codon usage
and comparative alignment with sequences from other
Plasmodium species, these heptads are best explained by a
recent tandem duplication of a single heptad motif in P.
falciparum or its immediate ancestor [31]. No other apicomplexan RPB1 contains tandemly repeated heptads,
nor does the nearest evolutionary relative of the apicomplexans (Fig. 2). Although vestigial or convergent heptad
repeats are found in a few organisms scattered across the
eukaryotic evolutionary tree, strong stabilizing selection
on CTD structure appears to be restricted to those eukaryotic lineages found in the "CTD-clade" (Fig. 2).
In our analyses of CDKs, members of this "CTD-clade" are
precisely the same eukaryotes to which clear orthologs of
CDK7 and CDK8 are restricted. When sequences recovered from additional but incomplete eukaryotic genomes
are included in phylogenetic analyses, distribution of
these two kinases remains tightly correlated with strong
conservation of canonical CTD repeats (see additional file
1). Moreover, unlike CDK1, the primary characterized
function of both of these kinases is to mediate RNAP IIA/
IIO cycling through reversible phosphorylation of CTD
residues [19-24].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/69

Taken together, these findings suggest that the RNAP II
CTD has undergone a co-evolutionary process with CDK7
and CDK8. If phylogenetic results based on CDK and
RPB1 sequences reflect evolutionary history, the inference
of a "CTD-clade" in both sets of analyses suggests that
CDK7 and 8 originated as part of a major shift in the
mechanics of RNAP II transcription in the ancestor of the
"CTD-clade" [31]. It was in that ancestor that reversible
phosphorylation of the CTD became a central organizing
principle for regulating the transcription cycle, and laid
the foundation for more complicated mechanisms of
transcriptional control in these organisms. Such a profound shift in the mechanics of RNAP II transcription
would explain why the CTD is conserved so strongly in
members of the CTD-clade, but not in many other eukaryotic lineages [31]. In this scenario, other known or putative CTD kinases (certainly CDK1 and apparently CDK9)
originated before canalization of a CTD-based RNAP II
transcription cycle, and were adapted later as CTD
kinases.
It also is possible that the co-evolution inferred from comparisons of the phylogenetic distribution of RPB1 and
CDKs7/8 does not reflect the pattern of evolutionary history but, instead, results from functional constraints
driven by CTD/CDK interactions. Both GlCAKlike from
Giardia and PfMrk from Plasmodium have been suggested
previously to be orthologs of CDK7 [36,38]; these
hypotheses are rejected strongly by our phylogenetic analyses. Assuming these kinases really are CDK7s, then their
failure to cluster with other orthologs must be due to phylogenetic artifacts, frequently referred to as "long-branch
attraction" [39], that can be common when rates of evolution vary dramatically among sequences. The large
amounts of sequence divergence of PfMrk and GlCAKlike
from other CDK7s, along with a complete degeneration of
the CTD in Giardia species and apicomplexans as a group,
are unlikely to coincidental. It is possible that those
organisms retaining a RNAP II transcription cycle mediated by CDK7 and 8 kinase activity form distinct clades, in
both RPB1 and kinase derived trees, because both sets of
proteins share parallel modes of evolution driven by their
physical interactions. In this case, the observation of coevolution between the CTD and CTD-directed kinases
need not have a phylogenetic basis, only a functional one.
Most putative CDKs from Giardia and Trypanosoma, and
several from Plasmodium, do not associate strongly with
any established CDK family. It is reasonable to assume
that at least some of these kinases are orthologs of defined
CDK groups, but have diverged to the point that they are
not recognizable using sequence-based phylogenetic
methods. Although such a scenario may have disturbing
implications for the use of these methods across broad
evolutionary distances, particularly when functional

understood, it cannot be ruled out as an explanation for
our observations. Analyses of additional genomes from
diverse eukaryotes are required, both to verify our observations of co-evolution between the CTD and CTDdirected kinases, and to determine its bases.

related kinases, and probably ancestral to them, and that
their core functions are more similar across the broad
diversity of eukaryotic lineages. It will be interesting to see
whether these preliminary hypotheses are supported as
more genomes are sequenced completely, particularly
from diverse protistan organisms.

General evolutionary trends in the CDK family
Kinases from protistan organisms
In an effort to understand the broader evolutionary history of CDKs, three deep-branching protists with complete genomes, Plasmodium falciparum, Trypanosoma brucei
and Giardia lamblia, were included in our study. Our Blast
searches detected 15 putative kinases from these protists;
six from Plasmodium falciparum, four from Trypanosoma
brucei and five from Giardia lamblia (Table 1). The phylogenetic positions and orthologous relationships of these
kinases generally are not well defined by phylogenetic
analyses (Fig. 1). Four of them (GlCdc2L3, GlCAKlike,
TbCrk6 and PfCrk4), along with two microsporidian
kinases (EcCrkB and EcCrkD) branched close to ScCak1
and SpCsk1, cyclin-activating kinases from yeasts. All of
these sequences are highly divergent, and it is difficult to
determine, whether their branching positions are due to a
phylogenetic artifact or a phylogenetic relationship. As
noted above, GlCAKlike kinase has been proposed as a
Giardia CDK7 ortholog based on JTT distance data [38], a
relationship not supported by our broader phylogenetic
analyses. Moreover, there are no experimental data
reported on the functions of any of these kinases. Other
putative protistan CDKs, GlCdc2L4, PfMrk and PfPk6,
scatter among CDKs from other organisms, but with no
statistical confidence for any implied relationship. Our
most strongly supported results indicate that six of these
kinases (TbCdc2L, TbCrk2 and 3, PfPk5, GlCdc2L1 and
L2) belong to cell-cycle related kinase families CDK1 and
CDK5. In particular, PfPk5 is well-supported as an
ortholog of CDK5. In addition, two kinases from Plasmodium (PfCrk1 and PfCrk3) appear to be transcriptionrelated kinases, PfCrk1 groups with the CDK10/11 family,
and PfCrk3 with CDK9.

Cell-cycle related kinases
Our analyses support well-defined groups for cell-cycle
kinases CDK1, CDK4/6 and CDK5. An ortholog of either
CDK1 or CDK5 is found in all of the organisms in our
study, and these two families appear to be closely related.
TbCrk3 was proposed as a functional homolog of CDK1
in Trypanosoma [40]; here it groups among cell-cycle
kinases, but is not specifically related to CDK1. CDK4/6
appears to be present only in human, Drosophila and C.
elegans. The CDK5 family has undergone expansion in
metazoans, including PFTAIRE and PCTAIRE kinases, and
putative orthologs of CDK5 are detected in Plasmodium,
Trypanosoma and Giardia. Interestingly, no CDK from
plants associates strongly with the CDK5 group, while the
CdkB-type kinases, which are specific to plants, branch as
sister to a broader CDK1/CDK5 clade. Our overall results
suggest that cell-cycle kinases have undergone extensive
and independent evolutionary diversification in different
eukaryotic lineages, and it may be difficult to classify
many of them based on orthologous relationships in phylogenetic analyses. It may be that functional homologies,
once established experimentally, will prove to be more
consistent criteria for designating CDK groups.

The phylogenetic distribution of protistan kinases indicate that cell-cycle related kinases are present, or at least
their functions are more strongly conserved (see discussion above regarding CTD/CDK co-evolution), in a more
diverse array of eukaryotes than are transcription-related
kinases. This pattern also is seen in a more widely-sampled analyses including CDKs from a number of organisms with incompletely sequenced genomes, including
Dictyostelium discoideum that has a canonical RNAP II
CTD, and Leishmania major, Cryptosporidium parvum and
Entamoeba histolytica, which all lack a CTD (see additional
file 1). Thus, the overall results suggest that cell-cycle
related kinases are more ancient than transcription-

The CDK7 family
Clear orthologs of CDK7 from animals, plants, yeasts and
Microsporidian are strongly supported as a core family,
with CDK-activating kinase from Arabidopsis (AtCdkF),
and its apparent orthologs from animals, branching as a
sister group. In addition to their role as CTD kinases,
members of the CDK7 family in plants, animals and fission yeast can function as a CDK-activating kinase (CAK)
[41,42]. Unlike animals and yeast, however, four CDK7like of CAKs were isolated from Arabidopsis [35]. AtCdkF
(AtCAK1), which groups with human CCRK and apparent
orthologs from Drosophila and Caenorhabiditis, exhibits
only CAK activity but no CTD kinase activity. Consistent
with the phylogenetic relationships recovered in our analysis, human CCRK and other animal orthologs were
recently shown to have CAK activity [43]. In contrast,
AtCdkD3 (AtCAK2) and AtCdkD2 (AtCAK4) display both
CAK and CTD kinase activity and, along with a single
CDK7 from rice, are included in a strongly supported
CDK7 clade. Interestingly, and despite its high sequence
similarity to AtCdkD3, no kinase activity was reported
from AtCdkD1 (AtCAK3) [35]. Apparently CAKs in Arabidopsis have diversified substantially, and may be regulated

Page 9 of 13
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2004, 5:69

in different ways from those in yeast, animals, and even
rice.
ScCAK1 and SpCSK1 from yeasts also have CAK activity;
however, despite their functional similarity to kinases in
the CCRK group, they do not group with animal or plant
CAKs (Fig. 1). Interestingly, in the single most likely tree
recovered in our expanded Bayesian analysis of 133
sequences, ScCAK1 and SpCsk1 group with other CAKs in
the sister clade to CDK7 (additional file 1); however, there
is no support for this placement in the Bayesian probability distribution. ScCAK1 and SpCSK1 sequences are highly
divergent from all CDKs, and the regulation of CAK activity in yeast is very different from that of animals and
plants [42,44]. Thus, alternative lines of evidence may be
required to determine whether there is any specific evolutionary relationship among all CAKs.
The CDK 8 family
CDK 8 (SRB10 in yeast) is a component of the multi-subunit Mediator complex, which transduces signals from cis
regulatory elements to RNAP II; it is proposed to inhibit
transcription initiation by phosphorylation of the CTD.
CDK8/SRB10 and its partner cyclin C/SRB11, together
with SRB8 and SRB9, form a specific sub-module that is
variably associated with the RNAP II holoenzyme, and
potentially with the free mediator complex [45]. Apparent
orthologs of CDK8 form a well-defined group, including
sequences from plants, animals and yeasts. Interestingly,
although a member of the CTD clade (Fig. 2 and note that
all microsporidian RPB1 genes isolated to date encode a
CTD), no ortholog of CDK8 was identified from Encephalitozoon. Our further blast results (unpublished data)
failed to identify any of the units of the CDK8/SRB10
(SRBs8-11) sub-module in the Microsporidia suggesting a
loss of CDK8/SRB10 unit from these highly reduced
parasites.

Although the CDK8/SRB10 sub-module has been implicated in negative regulation of transcription by phosphorylation of TFIIH, leading to the inhibition of the TFIIH
CTD kinase and transcription [46], the exact mechanism
still is unclear. Recent research shows that the Mediator
containing this sub-module is isolated only in free form,
not associated with RNAP II. In contrast, Mediator lacking
this sub-module associates with the polymerase [47].
There also is experimental evidence that negative Mediator-RNAP II regulation by the SRB8-11 sub-module is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to humans [47].
Therefore, the absence of identifiable components of the
SRB8-11 sub-module in Encephalitozoon suggests CDK8/
SRB10 function is absent from the Microsporidia. The loss
of CDK8 from Microsporidia, along with absolute conservation of CDKs7 and 9 in all members of the "CTD-clade"
(Figs. 1 and 2) implies that interactions between the CTD

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/69

and Mediator complex are less strongly entrained into
essential RNAP II function, than are those regulated by
TFIIH and P-TEFB kinase activity.
The CDK 9 family
CDK9 is a component of the P-TEFb complex, which is a
positive-acting RNAP II transcription elongation factor
[48,49]. Research has focused on P-TEFb from animals
and budding yeast. A definitive yeast homolog of animal
P-TEFb has not yet been determined from functional studies, but two candidates have emerged: the BUR1 complex
and the CTDK-I complex [26]. Based on our blast and
phylogenetic analyses, BUR1 and CTK1 (subunit of
CTDK-I complex) are found in two distinct but related
kinase groups, each with orthologs from other eukaryotes.
BUR1 is identified as the specific ortholog of CDK9 from
metazoans, budding yeast and probably the
Microsporidia.

Unexpectedly, the CDC2-like5 kinases and CrkRS from
animals are highly supported as orthologs of CTK1 from
yeasts. Although their functions are not yet clear [50], our
results suggest that human CDC2-like5 kinases and CrkRS
have CDK9 function. Recent analyses of CrkRS (CDC2related kinase with an RS-rich domain) suggest that it has
CTD kinase activity and helps to link transcription directly
to intron splicing [51]. This CTK1 clade also contains
putative CDK9 (CdkC) kinases from plants and as well as
a CDC2-like kinase from Plasmodium (PfCRK3). The latter
is the only apparent ortholog of a CTD-directed kinase
(CDKs 7, 8 or 9) identified in our analyses from any
organism outside the "CTD-clade." It remains to be
determined whether PfCRK3 possesses the P-TEFb function of CTK1, since it is the only protistan sequence
present in either CDK9 sub-group, and the RNAP II CTD
has not been conserved in apicomplexans or their closest
relatives (Fig. 2).
In addition to the two previously identified copies of
CDK9 (CdkC1 and CdkC2) from Arabidopsis, and one
from Oryza (CdkC1) [33,34], our Blast searches also
retrieved a large group of CDK9-like sequences (14 from
Arabidopsis and 8 from Oryza) (Table 1). These kinases are
annotated as "Cdc2-like" in databases and some of them
also were identified in previous analyses of CDK evolution [38]. With one exception (Os1562.H01.5), all of
these kinases group in a single cluster, with 100% support,
and as sister to previously identified CDK9s of Arabidopsis
and Oryza (additional file 1). Os1562.H01.5 (Gi:
38424086) from Oryza is extremely similar to OsCdkC1
and very likely a second copy of CdkC (CDK9) from
Oryza. There is no evidence of biological functions for
these kinases as yet, but our results indicate that they are
part of a large CDK9 complex specific to plants.

The CDK10/11 family
In this group, orthologs of CDK10 are found only in
human and Drosophila, while CDK11 occurs in human,
Drosophila and Caenorhabditis. Three putative CDK11
orthologs were found in plants (two from Arabidopsis and
one from Oryza). CDK10 has been implicated in the regulation of the G2/M phase of the cell cycle [52], but a cyclin
partner has yet to be defined. Only one protein associated
with CDK10, ETS2 transcription factor, has been identified so far, suggesting a link to transcription [9]. CDK11
associates with cyclin L as a partner, and is a proposed
component of a signaling pathway that helps to coordinate transcription and RNA-processing events [10-13].
The close relationship between the CDK10 and CDK11
may reflect evolutionary and/or mechanistic similarities,
but neither kinase family has been well characterized
functionally. In addition, BC18H10 from S. pombe and
PfCRK1 from Plasmodium show close relationships to the
CDK10/11 family, but no function has yet been determined for these kinases either.

Conclusions
The apparent co-evolution between the CTD and certain
CTD-specific kinases suggests an explanation for strong
stabilizing selection on CTD structure in some eukaryotes,
and its complete degeneration in others. Based on the
genomes examined in this study, either the origins of
CDK7 and CDK8 in an unknown ancestor of the "CTDclade," or the canalization of reversible phosphorylation
of the CTD in some eukaryotic groups but not others,
could account for the variation seen in RPB1 C-terminal
structure. In either case, once thoroughly "locked" into
RNAP II function, the CTD must have recruited other transcription and processing related proteins into a growing
machinery of the "transcriptosome" [53]. Our results suggest that was the case for several CDKs that clearly predate
the canalization of CTD-based RNAP II transcription; further genomic analyses are underway to look for other protein-protein interactions that could be responsible for
strong evolutionary conservation of the CTD in members
of the "CTD-clade."
This work also provides a new perspective on the overall
evolution CDKs and evolutionary relationships among
kinase families. Our combined genomic and phylogenetic
analyses suggest that transcription-related kinases originated later than cell cycle-related CDKs. Finally, our
results point to potential functions for a variety of previously uncharacterized kinases, based on their apparent
orthologous relationships to defined CDKs. Additional
completed genomes, particularly those from broadly
diverse protists (especially non-parasitic forms), will be
critical to address these questions further. Such comparative analyses will be invaluable in helping to guide exper-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/69

imental studies, which ultimately are required to verify
the functional properties of each putative CDK.

Methods
Identification and alignment of protein sequences
Representatives of all previously identified CDKs from
budding yeast and human were obtained from Genbank,
and used as probes in TBlastN and PSI-Blast [54] against
the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI), and additional specific complete genome databases, with an absolute cut-off of E<0.001. To confirm the
identities of putative CDKs detected by the TBlastN, each
identified sequence was used as a query in reciprocal Blast
searches, to verify that it retrieved the original query
sequences, and global sequence alignments were performed to confirm putative homologies to CDKs, according to the CDC-related kinase characterized motifs that
use CDK2 as the model [55].

Initially, a number of inferred protein sequences were
grouped into six subsets according to clear similarities to
specific CDK family orthologs. These subgroups first were
aligned in CLUSTAL X [56], and the resulting sub-alignments then were aligned with each other and adjusted
through visual inspection and comparison to the kinase
alignment of Liu and Kipreos (2000) [32]. Regions that
could not be aligned reliably were excluded from subsequent phylogenetic analysis. The resulting alignment
included 233 positions including gaps (See additional
data file 2 and 3 for the original and final aligned matrices
used in this study).
Phylogenetic analysis
Maximum-likelihood (ML) estimates of substitution
parameters were made with the program TREEPUZZLE-50
[57] assuming a mixed model for variation among sites,
with one category for invariable sites and a four-category
discrete approximation to Γ-distribution, and the JTT
weighting matrix for probability of change among amino
acids. Further analyses were performed in MrBayes 3.0 b4
[58] using metropolis-coupled Markov chain Monte Carlo
analysis. Four simultaneous Markov chains were run, also
under an invariant + Γ rate model and a JTT substitution
matrix. Four chains, one heated, were run for 500,000
generations, beginning with random a priori trees. Trees
were sampled from the posterior probability distribution
every 100 generations. The empirical burn-in required for
likelihoods to converge was less than 100,000 generations; an additional 400,000 generations were run and the
first 100,000 were excluded from analysis of Bayesian posterior probabilities. Thus, a total of 4,000 trees were examined to determine the 50% majority-rule consensus tree
and Bayesian support values. In addition, 1000 distance
(PROTDIST + NEIGHBOR) bootstrap replicates were

performed in PHYLIP 3.573 [59], also using a JTT substitution model.
Several a priori alternative hypotheses regarding CDK7
evolution were compared by KHT likelihood paired-sites
tests [37]. Trees were constrained to require PfMRK from
Plasmodium or GlCAKlike from Giardia, which previously
have been characterized as a CDK7 orthologs [36,38], to
group with the well-defined CDK7 clade. All most parsimonious trees retaining these constrained relationships
were tested against the fully resolved Bayesian consensus
tree to determine whether the a priori hypotheses of
orthologous relationships to CDK7 were significantly
worse than the Bayesian consensus tree.
