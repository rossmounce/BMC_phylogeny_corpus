Abstract
Background: Despite the prevalence of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in bacteria, to this date
there were few studies on HGT in the context of gene expression, operons and protein-protein
interactions. Using the recently available data set on the E. coli protein-protein interaction network,
we sought to explore the impact of HGT on genome structure and protein networks.
Results: We classified the E. coli genes into three categories based on their evolutionary
conservation: a set of 2158 Core genes that are shared by all E. coli strains, a set of 1044 Non-core
genes that are strain-specific, and a set of 1053 genes that were putatively acquired by horizontal
transfer. We observed a clear correlation between gene expressivity (measured by Codon
Adaptation Index), evolutionary rates, and node connectivity between these categories of genes.
Specifically, we found the Core genes are the most highly expressed and the most slowly evolving,
while the HGT genes are expressed at the lowest level and evolve at the highest rate. Core genes
are the most likely and HGT genes are the least likely to be member of the operons. In addition,
we found the Core genes on average are more highly connected than Non-core and HGT genes in
the protein interaction network, however the HGT genes displayed a significantly higher mean node
degree than the Core and Non-core genes in the defence COG functional category. Interestingly,
HGT genes are more likely to be connected to Core genes than expected by chance, which suggest
a model of differential attachment in the expansion of cellular networks.
Conclusion: Results from our analysis shed light on the mode and mechanism of the integration
of horizontally transferred genes into operons and protein interaction networks.

Background
It is generally accepted that horizontal gene transfer
(HGT) is an important process in bacterial genome evolution, which provides both novel metabolic capabilities,
and catalyzing the diversification of bacterial lineages

[1,2]. Although, the extent of the evolutionary impact of
HGT is still under debate [3], it is generally accepted that
roughly 10–40% of the protein-coding genes are likely to
have been introduced by HGT into the E. coli K12 genome

[4] since the species divergence from the Salmonella lineage approximately 100 million years ago [5].

on these different gene categories would leave footprints
in their sequence and gene expression characteristics.

Currently, no plausible mechanisms have been proposed
for the incorporation of HGT genes into their recipient
genomes. We envisage that successful incorporation of a
horizontally transferred gene needs not only its successful
transcription and translation, but also its integration into
the existing functional cellular network. We foresee a
number of barriers that potentially exist against the incorporation and expression of horizontally transferred genes
in a new recipient genome.

(ii). The contribution of HGT to operon formation
It is known that horizontally transferred genes can be
inserted into existing operons and thus contribute to the
dynamic nature of the gene order and membership of
these operons [8-15]. Although a few studies have investigated the evolutionary stability and the conservation of
gene order of operons [16,17], the relative contribution of
HGT on the evolutionary composition of operons
remains unclear. In this regard, we aimed to explore the
prevalence of HGT genes in operons by cataloguing the
presence of operons consisting of Core, Non-core and HGT
genes.

The first step of integration for horizontally transferred
genes is its incorporation into the host transcription
machinery. Bacterial genes are often organized into
groups called operons, which enable a simple and unified
mechanism of gene regulation in bacteria. Integrating into
operons may be regarded as beneficial for the foreign
invading genes, since they gain the opportunity not only
to be co-regulated and but also co-expressed with resident
genes. Secondly, HGT genes may need to optimize their
codon usage to be compatible to the host in order to be
efficiently transcribed and translated. Thirdly, the protein
product has to be integrated into the functional cellular
network in order to gain interaction partners and contribute fitness benefits to the organism. Failure to achieve any
of the above steps may result in eventual degradation and
pseudogenization.
Considering the prevalence of horizontal gene transfer
during bacterial genome evolution, the importance of
studies exploring their mode of evolution, expression and
impact on genomic organization and protein-interactions
would thus further our understanding of horizontal gene
transfer. With the emergence of high-throughput functional genomics and proteomics data, we are offered a
unique opportunity of answering these questions. Thus
our specific aims in this paper were to address the following questions:
(i). Evolutionary Rates and Gene Expression
characteristics of Core, Non-core and HGT genes
Bacterial genomes are known to be dynamic, consisting of
genes with different evolutionary histories. Some genes
are evolutionarily conserved while others can be gained
and lost in a lineage-specific fashion, and by horizontal
gene transfer events. Prior studies on yeast and vertebrates
have suggested that genes that are the most evolutionary
conserved and most highly expressed evolve at the slowest
rate [6,7]. Therefore to investigate the effect of selection
on these various gene categories, we classified E. coli genes
according to their evolutionary conservation into Core,
Non-core and HGT genes (see Methods). In this regard, we
hypothesize that the cumulative effect of selection acting

(iii). The impact of HGT on protein-protein interactions
and networks
Another area that has been missing in the study of HGT
events is the aspect of protein-protein interactions and cellular networks. A few studies have concentrated on the
impact of horizontal gene transfer on metabolic networks
[18,19]. Unfortunately very little is known about the
effect of horizontal gene transfer on the global protein
interaction networks in this aspect, mostly due to the lack
of cellular interaction data in bacteria until recently.

It has been suggested that the scale-free properties of biological networks may in part be due to a model of preferential attachment by means of gene duplication, whereby
new nodes preferentially attach to existing highly connected nodes. In networks that have evolved via preferential attachment, older nodes should have a higher average
connectivity than younger nodes [20]. In this regard, horizontal gene transfer can be considered as an additional
biological mechanism to the existing model of preferential attachment. Although distinctly different, a model of
network growth and expansion that involves gene duplication results in a duplicate protein copy with exact same
or similar function, whereas a mechanism involving HGT
may represent novel functions. In this regard, proteins
encoded by HGT genes can be seen as competing with resident genes in establishing and gaining protein interactions.
We investigated both operons and protein interactions as
a means of detecting successful incorporation of putative
horizontally transferred genes in the E. coli genome. We
explored the possibility that successful HGT genes would
require integration at the level of operons to be expressed
and integration at the network level to establish fitness
benefits to the organism. We found horizontally transferred genes exhibit lower gene expressivity and evolve at
faster evolutionary rates than evolutionarily conserved
core genes. In addition, although proteins encoded by

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:23

horizontally transferred genes have lower network connectivity, they preferentially attach to resident Core proteins rather than Non-core proteins within the protein
interaction network. We conclude that a small proportion
of the low connectivity proteins may have arisen from
HGT events.

Methods
Data
Genome sequences available for the various E. coli strains
were downloaded from the NCBI (Escherichia coli K12
MG1655 – NC_000913; Escherichia coli O157H7 –
NC_002695; Escherichia coli O157H7_EDL933 –
NC_002655; Escherichia coli CFT073 – NC_004431;
Escherichia coli UTI89 – NC_007946).
Deriving a set of HGT genes in E. coli
Our primary data set consisted of horizontal gene transfer
events that were identified using a combination of the
gene phylogeny and the pattern of gene presence and gene
absence [15]. This approach is similar to gene presence/
absence analyses [21,22].

For detection of horizontal gene transfer events, a total of
326 complete bacterial genome sequences divided into 8
bacterial clades were downloaded from MicrobesOnline
database [23]. Using each protein sequence contained
within the E. coli K12 genome as query, BLASTP sequence
similarity searches are conducted against all 326 bacterial
proteomes. Subsequent BLAST sequence hits are further
categorized into "BestN" hit categories with the Best0 category referring to the E. coli K12 gene itself. Each gene is
assigned to a relative age category (i.e. clade) based on the
BLASTP hit with the highest score. The method classifies
each gene within the E. coli K12 genome as belonging to
either (i) a set of horizontally transferred gene set (named
HGT), (ii) a native gene set restricted to the E. coli lineage
(named Native) or (iii) a gene set with no known
sequence homologs (named ORFan). Thus the BLASTP
scores gradually decrease in groups with increasing phylogenetic distance from E. coli K12.
Multiple sequence alignments based on protein
sequences are then constructed using the MUSCLE
sequence alignment software [24]. Fast neighbour-joining
trees [25] are then subsequently constructed for each protein sequence alignment. Genes that lack "close"
homologs in consecutive groups of related bacteria are
then confirmed using a quartet test available within the
software package TREE-PUZZLE [26]. To infer a horizontal gene transfer event; gene trees are compared with the
MicrobesOnline specie tree (see above). If a strongly supported clade in the gene tree was present in disparate
genomes, so that three or more deletion events would be

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/23

required to explain the distribution of the subfamily on
the species tree, then an HGT event was assigned.
In addition, we have included a comparison of horizontally transferred genes obtained by various HGT detection
methods which comprised three surrogate (non-tree
based) methods namely, HGT-DB [27], the method published by Mrazek and Karlin [28] and a support vector
machine-based method (HGT_SVM) developed by Tsirigos and Rigoutsos [29] versus our data derived from a
combined phylogenetic and gene presence/absence based
method [15], both in terms of overall counts but also in
terms of their distribution of Cluster of Orthologous
(COG) functional categories (see Additional File 1).
On the overall, the method developed by Price et al. predicts more HGT genes in E. coli K12 than the three surrogate methods. It is known that base compositional
differences between resident and invading genes are
"ameliorated" over a few million years [30]. Surrogate
methods that use a compositional approach may preferentially detect recent horizontal gene transfer events and
genes with atypical base compositions [21]. Thus, a crossphylum approach using phylogenetic tree based methods
combined with gene phyletic profiles are more likely to
detect ancient but also recent horizontal gene transfer
events.
Deriving a set of Core and a set of Non-core E. coli genes
Our operational definition of a Core set of genes was
meant to reflect the evolutionary retention of a set of common genes in all E. coli strains. In this regard, our Non-core
set reflect genes that are found in at least one strain but
not all strains, and HGT genes correspond to genes which
are derived from putative recent horizontal gene transfer
events. Thus, this distinction between Core and Non-core
genes serves to illustrate the difference between a stable
and invariant Core component and a variable Non-core
component that is specific to E. coli strains. In this regard,
the Non-core genes represent genes with a restricted phylogenetic distribution limited to one or more E. coli strains.
These genes can be lost or gained in a strain-specific manner. Thus to ensure that there is no overlap between any
evolutionary gene categories we have filtered the Core,
Non-core and HGT gene sets to ensure a non-overlapping
set of each gene category is maintained.

We derived an evolutionary Core set of 2158 E. coli genes
based on the criteria of using phylogenetic gene conservation and genomic context (positional gene conservation).
Starting with an all-vs-all protein sequence comparison
consisting of the five E. coli genomes, we grouped E. coli
K12 genes based on their phylogenetic gene conservation
profiles within all five strains. To ensure a high quality
Core gene set, we extracted and compared the chromo-

somal locations of all Core genes. It is known that genes
which evolve vertically between closely related species can
be divided into those that retain homologous chromosomal positions (positional orthologs) and those that do
not [31]. In addition, phylogenetic trees were constructed
based on selected protein sequences to verify the phylogenetic relationship between the five E. coli strains.
Our Non-core gene set was obtained by post-process filtering the BLAST sequence comparison results of E. coli K12
genes which had BLAST hits in at least one or more E. coli
genomes, but not present in all genomes. We also
extracted and compared gene chromosomal locations of
this gene set and constructed phylogenetic trees for further
investigation. Since this gene set showed lower phylogenetic conservation, they were also positionally conserved
to a lesser extent.
In addition, results from correspondence analysis of
codon usage also revealed a distinction between our Core,
Non-core and HGT gene categories (Additional File 2). The
Core,Non-core and HGT gene lists can be found in Additional Files.
E. coli operons
Data pertaining to Escherichia coli operons and transcriptional units were downloaded from RegulonDB version
5.7 [32,33]. RegulonDB is a manually curated database
that focuses on transcriptional regulation in E. coli with
information extracted from literature as well as sequence
databases such as GenBank. Its basic structural unit is the
operon, which describes the elements and properties of
transcriptional regulation. Thus in keeping with this definition, we refer to an operon as a poly-cistronic transcribed unit with its associated regulatory sites, whereas a
regulon is defined as a group of operons controlled by a
single regulator. As of RegulonDB version 5.7, 4570 E. coli
genes have been annotated and organized into 2684 operons.
Analysis of E. coli gene expression
E. coli K12 MG1655 microarray gene expression data were
downloaded from the NCBI GEO microarray database
[34]. We selected the GDS2600 data set, which closely
approximates growth under normal conditions. This data
set contains a time course which monitors the expression
of 4405 E. coli genes using spotted cDNAs in stationary
phase using LB media. Log2-transformed gene expression
values were used and we excluded genes with missing data
from the analysis. For each gene, mean gene expression
values across time points were calculated and used for
subsequent analysis.

Protein-Protein interaction networks
For construction of the E. coli interaction network, we
extracted the protein-protein interaction data from a
recently published mass spectrometry study [35]. We
examined this data set carefully to confirm that it was not
biased towards particular pathways or functional categories using the KEGG pathways and COG functional classification databases respectively. The whole analysis was
also re-performed using the protein interaction data from
Arifuzzaman et al. [36] (Additional Files 3 and 4).
Software
Detection of orthologs was performed using a reciprocal
best-hits approach as implemented in the RSD-algorithm
[37]. Multiple sequence alignments were constructed
from protein sequences using the ClustalW package [38].
Phylogenetic tree reconstructions were performed using
the neighbour-joining method [39]. Evolutionary substitution rates were estimated using the CODEML program
available from the PAML package[40]. Network analyses
were performed using algorithms implemented in the
NetworkX package [41] and visualised using PAJEK [42].
Statistical analyses were performed using the R-programming language environment.

Results and Discussion
HGT genes evolve faster and have lower expression levels
To investigate the selective pressure acting on organizational units, we classified E. coli genes according to their
evolutionary conservation into three categories, namely,
(i). Core Set: a conserved core set of genes that exist in all
E. coli strains. (ii). Non-core Set: genes that are found in at
least one strain but not in all strains, and (iii). HGT Set:
genes that are derived from putative recent horizontal
gene transfer events after the divergence of E. coli and Salmonella. By delineating genes according to their evolutionary conservation, we can more clearly identify the
evolutionary forces to which the various evolutionary
classes of genes are subjected.

Direct measurements of E. coli gene expression were
obtained from microarray gene expression experiments
(see Methods). In addition, we have also used the codon
adaptation index (CAI) as a proxy for gene expression
data, which we referred as "gene expressivity" [43].
Figure 1 shows that the Core genes have higher CAI gene
expressivity levels (Figure 1A) as well as log2 expression
values (Figure 1B) than Non-core and HGT genes (t-test
and Wilcox rank test, p-value < 0.001). This can be
explained by the different evolutionary histories of these
three groups of genes. The Core set of genes, being the oldest resident genes in the genome have thus had sufficient
time to adapt and optimise their codon usage patterns,
explaining the higher levels of gene expressivity; whereas

the recent horizontally transferred genes may need an
adaptation period during which their base composition
and codon usage patterns may need to be optimised to
their new resident genome.
Figure 2 shows that amongst the three categories of gene
sets, the Core set of genes evolve at the lowest substitution
rates (dN/dS) and HGT genes evolve at the fastest rates,
using E. coli K12 as reference for comparison (WilcoxonMann-Whitney test, p-value < 0.001). The high evolutionary rates observed for HGT genes may be explained by
either one of the following two hypotheses: (i) result of
reduced negative selection pressure, which enable the
invading genes to be purged from the genome, or (ii)
result of increased positive selection whereby HGT genes
contribute to the phenotypic character of E. coli strains
[14]. Accordingly, it is thought that the strain-specific
Non-core genes and HGT genes may contribute to the
pathogenic character separating the enterohemorrhagic
and uropathogenic from the benign E. coli K12 strain,
therefore these genes are under positive selection pressure.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/23

To investigate the relative contributions of the various
evolutionary gene categories on organizational structures,
we surveyed both operons and the protein interaction network for their content of Core, Non-core and HGT genes.
The Core set form a predominant portion of operons with
47% (2129 out of 4506 genes catalogued in RegulonDB
version 5.7) of the operons consisting of Core genes,
whereas 21% (948 out of 4506) of Non-core genes and
23% (1020 out of 4506) HGT genes, respectively,
accounted for the remaining gene constituents of operons
(Figure 3A). Similarly, proteins encoded by Core genes
account for a 67.5% (852 out of 1262) of the protein
interaction network as reported by Butland et al [46]
whereas Non-core genes and HGT genes account for 14.1%
(178 out of 1262) and 18.4% (232 out of 1262) respectively (Figure 3B).

Genes in Operons and Networks Display Higher Gene
Expressivity
There is increasing evidence to suggest that the chromosomal gene order in organisms is not always random [44].
It is known that proteins of linked genes evolve at comparable rates, and that natural selection may promote the
conservation of linkage of co-expressed genes [45].
Accordingly, genes in the same operon occur in close
physical proximity and are often known to be co-transcribed as units. In addition, genes encoding subunits of
protein complexes also need to be expressed at similar
times.

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:23

The tendency of operons to be enriched in Core genes can
be explained by a need to simplify regulation, since genes
residing in operons known to be under control of the
same promoter (Chi-squared test, p-value < 0.001). This
may facilitate horizontal gene transfer by enabling genes
to be inherited as a physical and functional cohesive
group rather than separate individual genes. In regard to
the protein interaction network, it is thought that the Core
genes form the ancestral backbones of the protein interaction network to which new functionalities are added via
protein nodes and thus strengthens a model by which
pathways expand [47].
To understand the impact of higher order organization of
genes (i.e. operons) and proteins (i.e. interaction complexes) on properties such as expression or evolution, we

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/23

investigated the gene expressivity characteristics and evolutionary substitution rates of the various categories of
gene sets. We found that Core genes in organizational clusters (both operons and protein interaction network or
PIN) have higher gene expressivity (CAI) values (Figure
4A and 4B) and as well as log2 expression values (Figure
4C and 4D) relative to Non-core and HGT genes (t-test and
Wilcox-test for both operons and PIN, p-value < 0.001).
For the PIN, this trend was robust against removal of
ribosomal proteins.
The overall trend from surveying operons and the protein
interaction network indicates that Core genes tend to be
found more often in organizational units such as operons
and networks. The evolutionary composition may be the
reason that highly clustered proteins in the protein inter-

action network display apparently high gene expressivity
and low substitution rates.
Distribution of COG Functional Categories between Core,
Non-core and HGT genes within the Operons and Protein
Interaction Network
We have analyzed and compared the distribution of the
Cluster of Orthologous (COG) functional categories of
the Core, Non-core and HGT genes within the E. coli K12
genome, protein interaction network and operons (Figures 5, 6 and 7). The various gene categories differ significantly in their COG distribution in the genome, the
protein interaction network and operons (Scheirer-RayHare test, p-value < 0.001, see Additional File 5).

In the overall gene comparison of the E. coli K12 Core,
Non-core and HGT gene sets, the Core genes constituted
the major evolutionary gene set present in all COG categories (Figure 5). The Non-core gene set in comparison to
the HGT gene set was markedly abundant in the two COG
categories: O (Posttranslational modification, protein
turnover, chaperones) and T (Signal transduction mechanisms). The HGT gene set was more abundant than the
Non-core gene set in the COG categories C (Energy production and conversion), F (Nucleotide transport and
metabolism), G (Carbohydrate transport and metabolism), I (Lipid metabolism), K (Transcription) and V

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/23

(Defense mechanisms). For the operons, the Core genes
occur predominately in all COG functional categories,
whereas the Non-core genes are over-represented in COG
categories S (Function unknown) and U (Intracellular
trafficking, Secretion, and vesicular transport) and the
HGT genes are over-represented in comparison to the
Non-core genes in COG functional categories C, E (Amino
acid transport and metabolism), G, H (Coenzyme metabolism), R (General function prediction only) and V
(Defence mechanisms) (Figure 6).
For the protein interaction network, the HGT genes are
over-represented in COG functional categories most notably C, G, H, and V (Figure 7). A most notable example in
this regard is the COG category V in which the HGT gene
set within the E. coli protein interaction network has a significantly higher mean node degree than the Core and
Non-core genes sets. The overall statistical difference in distribution of COG functional categories between the Core,
Non-core and HGT gene sets therefore seems to argue
against the notion of a Core-versus-Non-core or Core-versus-acquired gene category consisting of Non-core and
HGT genes, but rather strengthens the notion of a distinct
separate category for Non-core genes.

and HGT gene sets contained within operons differ in their distribution of COG functional categories (P-value < 0.001).

Network topology of the E. coli genes
To investigate the mode and mechanism of integration of
horizontally transferred genes into the E. coli protein-protein interaction network, we systemically investigated the
network characteristics of proteins encoded by the various
evolutionary categories of genes (Table 1). We found that
proteins corresponding to the Core gene set represent the
most highly connected protein nodes, which have an average connectivity of 11.0 interactors (Chi-squared test, pvalue < 0.05). In contrast, Non-core proteins and proteins
encoded by HGT genes have on average lower connectivities of 4.0 and 3.0 interactors respectively. This is consistent with our hypothesis that Core genes being the most
highly conserved genes have resided in the genome for
much longer, and thus had more opportunities to evolve
interactions. The result of the network analysis is consistent with this theory.

We also analyzed two additional network properties:
betweenness centrality and clustering coefficient (Table 1).
Betweenness centrality characterizes how essential a node is
in maintaining communication between each pair of
nodes in a network [48]. Depending on its position
within the network, removal of a node can have very different effects on the connectivity, topology and flux of the
network. Some nodes can be removed without any harmful effect, while others separate a connected network into

disconnected sub-graphs. Betweeness centrality is a measure
devised to describe the fraction of shortest paths going
through a given node, with high values indicating that a
node can reach many other nodes. Removal of nodes with
high centrality will make it difficult to reach from one
node to another, thus lengthen the path between nodes.
The clustering coefficient describes the local transitivity in a
network, with two nodes having a common neighbour in
a network being more likely to be neighbours [49].
Table 1 shows that the HGT genes have lower betweenness
centrality than the Core and Non-core genes, which suggests
that they are less important in cellular communications.
Interestingly the Non-core genes have higher betweeness
centrality than the Core genes, the implication of which
need to be further explored. On the other hand, Core
genes have the highest clustering coefficients, with any two
Core genes having a common neighbour being more likely
to be neighbours of each other. The results in Table 1 indicate the HGT genes are the least important in maintaining
the overall connectivity of the protein interaction network, in other words they are more likely to be peripheral
nodes.
Our analysis of the distribution of COG functional categories of the Core, Non-core and HGT nodes within the E.
coli protein interaction network reveal that the Core genes

Distribution among the COG categories for those E. coli genes that are members of proten-protein interaction network.

are the most abundant and cover all the major COG functional categories in comparison to the Non-core and HGT
gene sets (Figure 7). Although, the Non-core and HGT
genes show similar COG distribution profiles within the
protein interaction network, differences exist in COG categories C, G, H and V in which the HGT genes are relatively more abundant than Non-core genes. A most
notable result in this regard is the COG defense category
(V) in which the HGT gene set within the E. coli protein
interaction network has a significantly higher mean node
degree than the Core and Non-core genes set.
Preferential Attachment of HGT proteins to Core proteins
We further investigated the evolutionary profiles of the
interaction partners in the network. Table 2 shows that
about 74% of all the interactions are between a pair of

Core genes, 11.2 % of the interactions are between a Core
gene and a Non-core gene. In other words, in total about
85% of the interactions involve at least one Core gene.
Among the interactions involving HGT genes, a large percentage (89%) was between a HGT genes and a Core gene,
while interactions between Non-core and HGT genes only
account for 1%. This is surprising since the ratio between
Core genes and Non-core genes is only ~5:1, much smaller
than the 9:1 ratio (89%: 10%) that we observed in the network. This discrepancy in ratio implies that an HGT gene
have a higher propensity to establish interaction with a
Core gene than with a Non-core gene. Indeed, the proportions of HGT-Core interactions are higher than expected
by chance (Chi-squared test, p-value < 0.001).

Such a model of preferential attachment has previously
been proposed to explain the growth of protein interaction networks in S. cerevisiae [20,50,51] and was also suggested recently for E. coli [52]; however it has remained
mostly unproven since it was difficult to trace back the
evolution history of protein networks. Along this line, the
HGT genes in E. coli offer a unique opportunity to test this
theory since these genes are indeed "new genes" that were
only added to the network after the HGT event ~100 millions ago [5]. Our observation provided direct evidence
and support for this model, which has not been reported
previously.

Conclusion
To our knowledge, our analysis represent the first time
that the HGT events are investigated in the context of protein-protein interaction and cellular networks. This is
important because horizontal gene transfer in known to
be prevalent in bacterial genome evolution in shaping the
genome content, and they had an impact on the stability
and evolution of the protein interactions and network.
From our analyses, the distinguishing characteristics
which sets the HGT gene category apart from the Non-core
and Core gene categories are (i) higher evolutionary substitution rates (Ka/Ks), (ii) protein interaction network
statistical properties such as protein degree connectivity,
average clustering coefficients and betweeness centrality, (iii)
preferential attachment with regards to the number of
interactions formed by HGT genes, which indicate that
HGT proteins preferentially neither self-associate nor do
HGT proteins associate with Non-core proteins within the
E. coli protein interaction network.
Results from our study revealed a clear relationship
between gene expressivity, evolutionary rate and protein
connectivity for the three evolutionary classes of genes
(Figure 8). The conserved Core set of genes generally display higher gene expressivity and protein connectivity
than strain-specific Non-core and HGT genes. However,
both gene expressivity and protein connectivity are
inversely related to evolutionary rates, with the most
highly conserved genes evolving the slowest. In contrast,
horizontally transferred genes evolve at considerably
higher evolutionary rates, and have lower gene expressivity and protein connectivity. In addition, proteins
encoded by horizontally transferred genes attach preferentially to Core proteins within the E. coli protein interaction
network. Consistent with this finding is the general idea
that Core genes are the oldest resident genes and form the
backbone of the protein interaction network to which

new proteins are attached. These results may also suggest
that a proportion of the lowest connectivity proteins in
bacterial protein interaction networks are those genes
which are more likely to have recently been transferred
and incorporated into the E. coli genome.
This is reminiscent of the so-called "Complexity Hypothesis", which was proposed to explain why the successful
horizontal transfer of a gene is less probable if the connectivity of the protein it encodes is large [52], and its later
modification called the 'Extended Complexity hypothesis'
[53] which aims to explain why adaptive evolution is the
least likely for proteins with high complexity. Although
the Complexity Hypothesis and its modified version aim
to describe which types of genes are more or less likely to
be subjected to horizontal gene transfer, it fails to provide
a mode and mechanism for subsequent integration of the
horizontally transferred gene into it new recipient
genome. The results from our analysis support these
hypotheses with genomics and evolutionary data.
Considering the prevalence of HGT in bacteria, the relative contribution of HGT as an additional mechanism to
gene duplication may become more important on network evolution. Thus, with the availability of proteomics
data for more bacteria, we will most likely gain more
insight on the impact of HGT on the evolution of networks.
