Abstract
Background: Sequence data and other characters from mitochondrial genomes (gene translocations,
secondary structure of RNA molecules) are useful in phylogenetic studies among metazoan animals from
population to phylum level. Moreover, the comparison of complete mitochondrial sequences gives
valuable information about the evolution of small genomes, e.g. about different mechanisms of gene
translocation, gene duplication and gene loss, or concerning nucleotide frequency biases.
The Peracarida (gammarids, isopods, etc.) comprise about 21,000 species of crustaceans, living in many
environments from deep sea floor to arid terrestrial habitats. Ligia oceanica is a terrestrial isopod living at
rocky seashores of the european North Sea and Atlantic coastlines.

Results: The study reveals the first complete mitochondrial DNA sequence from a peracarid crustacean.
The mitochondrial genome of Ligia oceanica is a circular double-stranded DNA molecule, with a size of
15,289 bp. It shows several changes in mitochondrial gene order compared to other crustacean species.
An overview about mitochondrial gene order of all crustacean taxa yet sequenced is also presented. The
largest non-coding part (the putative mitochondrial control region) of the mitochondrial genome of Ligia
oceanica is unexpectedly not AT-rich compared to the remainder of the genome. It bears two repeat
regions (4× 10 bp and 3× 64 bp), and a GC-rich hairpin-like secondary structure. Some of the transfer
RNAs show secondary structures which derive from the usual cloverleaf pattern. While some tRNA genes
are putative targets for RNA editing, trnR could not be localized at all.
Conclusion: Gene order is not conserved among Peracarida, not even among isopods. The two isopod
species Ligia oceanica and Idotea baltica show a similarly derived gene order, compared to the arthropod
ground pattern and to the amphipod Parhyale hawaiiensis, suggesting that most of the translocation events
were already present the last common ancestor of these isopods. Beyond that, the positions of three
tRNA genes differ in the two isopod species. Strand bias in nucleotide frequency is reversed in both isopod
species compared to other Malacostraca. This is probably due to a reversal of the replication origin, which
is further supported by the fact that the hairpin structure typically found in the control region shows a
reversed orientation in the isopod species, compared to other crustaceans.

Background
The metazoan mitochondrial genome is a circular double
stranded DNA molecule of about 12–20 kb length. Due to
the important role of mitochondria for cell metabolism its
gene content is highly conserved and typically contains
the same 37 genes: 13 protein-coding genes, two ribosomal genes and 22 transfer RNA genes [1]. In addition
one A+T-rich non-coding part is present which contains
essential regulatory elements for transcription and replication. It is therefore referred to as the mitochondrial control region [1]. The organization of the mtDNA is compact
with very little non-coding sequences between genes, even
gene overlaps by a few nucleotides are commonly found
(especially at the boundaries between nad4/nad4L and
atp6/atp8). As a result the gene order of mitochondrial
genomes is relatively stable because rearrangements are
likely to disrupt genes. Thus changes in gene order are relatively rare, whereas tRNA genes more frequently change
their position than larger protein-coding and rRNA genes
[2]. Mollusca [3-6], Brachiopoda [7-10] and Nematoda
[11-14] represent phyla where a lot of rearrangements of
mitochondrial genomes were reported, whereas in Chordata only few changes in gene order were found [2].
Among arthropods a lot of species have retained the
arthropod ground pattern (or a slight modification in
Hexapods and Crustacea), while some taxa show frequent
genome rearrangements, e.g. Myriapoda [15-17],
Hymenoptera [18,19], Acari [20,21], and Araneae
[22,23]. Peracarid crustaceans seem to represent another
example, as two partially sequenced mitochondrial
genomes [24,25] exhibit strong differences between each
other and from the arthropod ground pattern.
Mitochondrial genomes offer a broad range of characters
to study phylogenetic relationships of animal taxa.
Besides nucleotide and amino acid sequences, tRNA secondary structures [26], deviations from the universal
genetic code [27,28], as well as changes in the mitochondrial gene order [29,30] are successfully used as characters
in phylogenetic inference. Especially the changes in gene
order prove as extremely reliable phylogenetic characters
because the probability that homoplastic translocations
occur in closely related taxa is very low. Dowton et al. [31]
calculated a chance of 1/2664 for a single gene translocation event occuring independently in two mitochondrial
genomes (starting from the same gene order in both).
However, this probability could be underestimated
according to yet unidentified constraints on modes of
gene rearrangements and should be handled with care.
With about 21,000 known species peracarids comprise
approximately one third of all crustacean species so far
described. Within Crustacea the isopods form the largest
subtaxon (10,000 species). Isopods show an amazing ecological diversity and morphological flexibility. They are
common around the globe, their habitats range from deep

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/241

sea plains over freshwater wells to terrestrial, even arid
deserts. Although to date 30 complete mitochondrial
genomes from crustaceans are available – thereof 16 from
malacostracan species – a complete mitochondrial
sequence of a peracarid species is still missing. Recent
sequencing efforts with the amphipod Parhyale hawaiiensis
[24] and the isopod Idotea baltica [25] produced almost
complete genome records, lacking only the control region
and some of the tRNA genes. Here we present the first
complete sequence of a peracarid mitochondrial genome.
Ligia oceanica (Isopoda: Oniscidea) is a terrestrial species
living on rocky seashore habitats. It is found from Norway
to Iceland in the north, around the british islands and the
north sea coasts south to northern Spain and Portugal. We
discuss changes in gene order compared to other crustacean taxa and give an overview about genome rearrangements in Crustacea. In addition we compare nucleotide
composition of isopod mitochondrial genes and tRNA
secondary structure, and describe in detail uncommon
features of the mitochondrial control region from Ligia
oceanica.

Results and discussion
Genome organization
The complete mitochondrial genome sequence of L. oceanica has an overall length of 15,289 bp [GenBank:DQ442914]. Successfully accomplished PCRs have
proven a circular organization of the molecule (Fig. 1).
Although this is the general state of metazoan mitochondrial DNA, it is mentioned here, because there is evidence
for a linear organization in a related species, Armadillidum
vulgare (Isopoda: Oniscidea) [32]. All 13 protein coding
subunits which are usually found in metazoan mitochondrial genomes are present, as well the two rRNA subunits
(Table 1). In contrast only 21 tRNA genes instead of the
typical number of 22 were identified (see below). In addition one major non-coding sequence was detected, which
presumably contains the origin of replication and regulatory elements for transcription (mitochondrial control
region). There are small gene overlaps at 14 gene borders.
The largest has a length of 15 nucleotides (between nad2
and trnC). Some small non-coding sequences exist which
occur quite often in arthropod mitochondrial genomes.
The largest extends up to 52 nucleotides and is located
between trnT and nad5.
Protein-coding genes
The A+T content of the protein coding genes of the L. oceanica mitochondrial genome is with 60.1% (A = 28.6; C =
16.7%; G = 23.2%; T = 31.5%) at the lower end observed
for malacostracan species. The values range from a 60.0%
minimum given by Cherax destructor [33] to a 69.3% maximum by Penaeus monodon [34]. Whereas the majority of
the 13 protein coding genes show usual start codons for
mtDNA, two genes begin with exceptional codons (Table

1). The gene atp8 probably starts with codon GTG.
Although there is an ATA codon nine bp downstream
from this start codon, alignments with atp8 amino acid
sequences from other arthropods suggest the presence of
more amino acids in the starting region. GTG is probably
also in use as start codon in mitochondrial genes from
Idotea baltica (nad1 and cox2) [25]. The second gene with
an apparently exceptional codon is cox1, which starts with

ACG. Although this seems to be unusual in metazoan
mitochondrial genomes, almost all other malacostracan
crustaceans studied so far have this start codon for cox1.
The only known exception concerns the crab Portunus
trituberculatus [35]. Two of the protein coding genes show
truncated stop codons. The gene for nad1 terminates with
TA whereas cox3 bears a single thymine at its end. This is
a well known phenomenon in the mitochondrial genome

and is frequently reported for several species. The stop
codons are very likely completed by post-transcriptional
polyadenylation, so that each transcript finally obtains a
functional UAA terminal codon [36].
In most arthropods there is a strand specific bias in nucleotide frequencies [37,38]. In detail the (+)strand contains
more cytosine and adenine, while the (-)strand consequently is more rich in guanine and thymine. Some taxa
show a reversal in that strand bias, among them the isopod Idotea baltica [25]. Strand bias is best reflected in GC
skew [37,39] of mitochondrial genes (Table 2). In Ligia
oceanica, as well as in Idotea baltica, GC skew is positive in
(+)strand encoded genes, while it is negative in (-)strand
encoded genes. This is in contrast to most other malacostracan crustaceans and is probably due to an inversion of

the mitochondrial control region, or at least the replication origin [37]. Further evidence comes from sequence
analysis of the control region (see below).
The effective number of codons (ENC) is a statistic
describing how far codon usage in protein-coding genes
departs from the equal usage of all synonymous codons
[40]. Its range lies between 20 (when only one codon is
used for each amino acid) and 62 (when all synonymous
codons are equally in use). The latter departs from the
usual value of 61 for nuclear genes as in invertebrate mitochondrial genomes 62 codons are in use (instead being a
stop codon, UGA codes for tryptophane in the invertebrate mitochondrial code). The ENC of all published crustacean mitochondrial genomes was determined for all
genes (Fig. 2), except nad4L and atp8, because these genes

are too short (less than 100 codons) to get proper results.
A positive correlation with G+C content in third codon
positions was revealed (r2 = 0.3381; p < 0.01). There is no
obvious difference seen between malacostracan and other
crustaceans. Genes from the two isopod species (Ligia oceanica and Idotea baltica) are of higher G+C content and
therefore show a higher than average number of effective
codons. For numbers of effective codons for individual
species and genes, as well as GenBank accession numbers
see additional file 1.
Transfer RNAs
We identified 21 out of normally found 22 transfer-RNA
genes in the mitochondrial genome of Ligia oceanica.
Despite extensive efforts to find secondary structures in
non-coding regions the gene trnR was not found in the
mitochondrial genomes sequence. By all means tRNA-Arg
is essential for maintaining translation of mitochondrial
gene products, so it has to be either imported into the
mitochondrion, or its gene exists in the mitochondrial
genome, but is subject to extensive RNA editing and therefore not identifiable by now.

Transfer-RNA genes are spread over the entire genome and
are located on both strands (Fig. 1, Table 1). 14 of them
were identified using tRNAscan-SE 1.21 [41]. The other
seven tRNA genes (trnD, trnC, trnE, trnI, trnF, trnS1, trnW)
were found by eye inspection of otherwise non-coding
regions. Some of the putative secondary structures derive
from the usual cloverleaf pattern (Fig. 3): tRNA-Cys and
tRNA-Ser(AGY) lack the DHU-arm. The loss of this arm in
tRNA-Ser(AGY) was also observed in many other arthro-

pod species, among malacostracan crustaceans Pseudocarcinas gigas and Macrobrachium rosenbergi [42], Euphausia
superba [43], Cherax destructor [33], Penaeus monodon [34],
and Portunus trituberculatus [35]. In contrast to that, the
derived structure of tRNA-Cys seems to be unique among
malacostracan species studied so far. Transfer-RNA-Val
and tRNA-Ile miss the TΨC-arm. Again these features are
not seen in other malacostracan crustaceans.
A misplaced adenine was recorded in the anticodon loop
of tRNA-Val. Its existence has been proven by repeated
sequencing of different PCR-products. To assure the functionality of this gene a correctional RNA editing must be
presumed in which a single nucleotide is removed. Similar post-transcriptional events with insertion and deletion
of single nucleotides are known from the mitochondrial
mRNAs of trypanosomes [44], tRNA editing was demonstrated in the centipede Lithobius forficatus [15]. In addition several mismatches are found in tRNA stems, most of
them in the acceptor stem (Fig. 3: tRNA-Gln, tRNA-Ile,
tRNA-Leu1, tRNA-Leu2, tRNA-Pro, tRNA-Val, and in the
anticodon stem (Fig. 3: tRNA-Ala, tRNA-Asp, tRNA-Thr,
tRNA-Tyr). Such mismatches were also reported from
other animal mitochondrial tRNAs and are probably further subjects to RNA editing [15,22,45].
Control region and repetitive sequences
There is one major non-coding region of 737 bp length
located between trnI and trnE. It is assumed to be the
mitochondrial control region. At its boundary to trnI it
contains two sections with repetitive sequences (Fig. 4).
The first consists of a series of four completely matching

sequences of 10 bp each and extends into trnI. The second
section is formed by a consecutive triplicate 64 bp segment. No similarities of these sequences to any other
mitochondrial gene could be identified. Only a few other
mitochondrial genomes were shown to contain any repeat
region: rabbit mitochondrial genomes show repeated 153
bp motifs in their mitochondrial control region, varying
in copy number between different individuals or tissues
[46]; the highly aberrant mitochondrial genome of the
brachiopod Lingula anatina posesses ten different unassigned repeated elements ranging in size between 28 bp
and 1092 bp and in copy number between 2 and 11 [7].
Also some insects show tandem repetitions in mitochondrial DNA [47].
Contrary to expectations the A+T content in the control
region (55.8%) is lower than in other parts of the genome
(protein coding genes: 60.1%). In contrast most other
arthropods have an A+T-rich control region. While the
repeat region is A+T-rich (70.3%), a 65 bp region near the
3'-end of the control region has an A+T content of only
14.1% (Fig. 4). That region is putatively folded into a hairpin-like structure with a stem consisting of 19 paired
nucleotides (two mismatches) and a loop consisting of 11
nucleotides (Fig. 5). This hairpin-like structure highly

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/241

resembles stem-loop structures known from insect mitochondrial control regions which have stems ranging
between 15–30 bp and loops of about 9–15 nucleotides
[48]. Similar stem-loop structures were found in other
crustacean species, like the mantis shrimp Squilla mantis
and the spiny lobster Panulirus japonicus (Fig 5). The flanking sequences around the stem region show conserved
motifs: 5'-flanking sequences show a TATA element, while
3'-flanking sequence contains a GACT in Ligia and Squilla,
while the GAAAT motif typical for insects is found in Panulirus. It is assumed that these structures are of functional
importance in conjunction with the origin of replication
[48]. In Ligia the flanking motifs are found in opposite
direction and strand compared to that of Squilla and Panulirus. This fact gives direct evidence for an inversion of the
control region in isopods (in addition to the reversed
strand bias of nucleotide frequency mentioned above).
An overview about gene translocations in Crustacea
Crustacean systematics is far from being settled. While
Malacostraca seems to be a well defined clade, the interrelationships between crustacean subtaxa is under debate
and even monophyly of Crustacea is doubtful, with
respect to the position of Hexapoda, which are probably
the next relatives to a crustacean subtaxon (Malacostraca,
Branchiopoda or Copepoda) [24,34,49-51]. Mitochondrial genome rearrangements may serve as phylogenetic
markers which support sistergroup relationships among
Crustacea. From 35 species of Crustcea complete or
almost complete mitochondrial genome sequences are
recorded in GenBank. Gene order is not conserved among
these taxa: only 13 species show no changes compared to
the pancrustacean ground pattern (Fig. 6 and 8: Pancrustacea ground pattern). Transfer-RNA genes are more often
translocated than other genes, probably because of their
small size.

Crustacea and Hexapoda (united as Pancrustacea
[30,52,53] or Tetraconata [54]) share the same ground
pattern in mitochondrial gene order [30]. It differs from
the euarthropod ground pattern [55] by the position of
one tRNA gene: trnL2 is located between cox1 and cox2,
whereas in Chelicerata, Myriapoda and Onychophora
trnL2 is located between nad1 and rrnl, adjacent to trnL1
[29,30]. Among other data, mitochondrial gene translocations have shown that the enigmatic Remipedia and Pentastomida definitely belong to Pancrustacea, as they show
the above mentioned translocation of trnL2 [56]. Only
three crustacean species do not show this character: the

Figure 4 of trnI and the major non-coding region (control region) of Ligia oceanica
Sequence
Sequence of trnI and the major non-coding region (control region) of Ligia oceanica. The region contains two sections with tandem repeats (4× 10 bp, 3× 64 bp) and a GC-rich region containing the putative hairpin structure (see also Fig. 5).

Three species (belonging to Cephalocarida, Branchiura
and Pentatomida) share a translocation of trnK to a position between trnR and trnN [56]. Among these, the tongue
worm Armillifer armillatus and the fish louse Argulus americanus share one further translocation (trnQ), together
with mtDNA sequence analysis supporting a close relationship between Pentastomida and Branchiura [51,56].
That was already discussed according to sperm morphology [59,60] and 18S molecular sequence data [61]. trnK is
also translocated in all other taxa refered to as members of
"Maxillopoda", a systematic unit only weakly based on
morphological characters. However, Ostracoda, Copepoda and Cirripedia each show different positions for trnK
compared to the above mentioned taxa, so there is no
good reason to take this as a homology. Because of contrary results from morphological and sequence based
analyses [51,62] it is also questionable to unite the Cephalocarida with Branchiura and Pentastomida to one clade,
solely based on the common translocation of trnK (No. 1
for Hutchinsoniella /Argulus/Armillifer in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7).
The three species of Cirripedia [56], [GenBank:NC_006293; GenBank:NC_008974] share several
translocations of tRNA genes (trnA, trnE, trnP). Another
series of events is difficult to reconstruct: trnC and trnY are
translocated in all three species to a position between

trnS2 and nad1, but in different order and on different
strands (referred to as No. 6 from Cirripedia in Fig. 6 and
7). In addition one species shows a triplication of trnC
(No. 7 from Pollicipes polymerus in Fig. 6 and 7). Two further differences are reported in Megabalanus volcano: an
inversion of a block of five genes (No. 7) and the probable
translocation of trnK and trnQ to a position between trnY
and trnC (No. 8 in Fig. 6 and 7). An alternative explanation is that trnK/trnQ were primarily translocated to that
position seen in Megabalanus and secondarily translocated
to the position seen in Pollicipes and Tetraclita. With data
from these three species alone, it is not possible to reconstruct a ground pattern of mitochondrial gene order of
Cirripedia with respect to the position of trnK, trnQ, trnY
and trnC.
A lot of further translocation events are recorded only in
single species, making them useless in phylogenetic analysis of the actual data set. Large genome rearrangements
involving also protein-coding genes are seen in the
branchiuran Argulus americanus [56], and in the ostracod
Vargula hilgendorfi [63], both accompanied by a duplication of the control region. But the highest degree of
genome rearrangement was found in the two copepod
species [57,58], where a complete reshuffling of the mitochondrial genomes has led to a gene order with almost no

similarities between the two species and to other crustaceans. Partial genomes from two other copepod species
revealed even more rearrangements [64]. In contrast three
species of Branchiopoda have retained the pancrustacean
ground pattern. The fourth species, Artemia franciscana
shows two tRNA gene translocations (trnI, trnQ) [65].
Among Malacostraca 10 from 19 species have retained the
pancrustacean ground pattern: six mantis shrimps (Stomatopoda) and four members of Decapoda (Fig. 8 and 9).
Among Decapoda independent translocation events
changed gene order in Pagurus longicarpus [66], Cherax
destructor [33], and Brachyura. The four species of Brachyura share a translocation of trnH, the freshwater crabs
Geothelphusa dehaani [67] and Eriocheir japonica [68] show
further translocations. In the Euphausiacea Euphausia

superba a swap between trnL1 and trnL2 seems to have
happened, probably preceded by a gene duplication [43].
Besides the two isopod species (Ligia oceanica, Idotea baltica), only one other peracarid mitochondrial sequence,
from the amphipod Parhyale hawaiiensis, was published
before [24]. From six gene translocations that must be
assumed to get the gene order of Parhyale hawaiiensis,
none is shared with the mitochondrial genomes of isopods (Fig. 8 and 9). Only trnI is translocated in both taxa,
but as its new position is different in Parhyale hawaiiensis
and Ligia oceanica (and not known in Idotea baltica), there
is no reason to presume that a translocation had already
happened in their common ancestor. Instead we assume
an independent translocation of this gene in isopods and
amphipods. This implies, that the ground pattern of gene

order in Peracarida must be identical to that of Pancrustacea.
Gene translocations in isopods
A comparison of the complete mitochondrial genome of
L. oceanica with the ancestral state of pancrustacea [30]
demonstrates several changes in gene order (Fig. 8). All in
all 11 genes (cob, nad1, nad5, rrnS, trnI, trnL1, trnF, trnS1,
trnT, trnW, trnV) and the control region are found in other
relative positions than reported in other malacostracan
crustaceans. By reason of parsimony we assume that these
positional changes were due to nine gene translocations
(Fig. 8, 9; No. 1–9) and a translocation of the major noncoding region (NCR). The genes nad5 and trnF, as well as
nad1 and trnL1 retained their adjacent positions, so that
they probably were translocated as a block. The other
genes were most likely repositioned by single translocation events. Five translocations led also to inversion of
genes to the complementary strand: cob, trnT and trnW
changed from the (+)strand to the (-)strand, whereas rrnS
and the block of nad5 and trnF were inverted from ()strand to (+)strand.

From the 11 genes being translocated in Ligia oceanica,
seven are also found in the same new positions in the
mitochondrial genome of Idotea baltica (Fig. 8) [25]. In
addition the mitochondrial control region, trnW, trnI and
trnS1 are not found in their original position in Idotea baltica, but will probably be found in the region not
sequenced yet – between rrnS and cob, similar to Ligia oceanica. Of all genes translocated in Ligia oceanica only trnV
is found in its original position in Idotea baltica. So of nine
gene translocation events supposed for Ligia oceanica,
eight must already have happended in the common
ancestor of both species (Fig. 8, 9; No. 1–8). The derived
gene order is probably the ground pattern for an isopod
subtaxon comprised of Oniscidea and Valvifera (and
probably more taxa). Translocation of trnV probably happened after the split of the oniscidean and valviferan lineages (Fig. 9, No. 9). In contrast, translocation of trnN
probably happened in the lineage leading to Idotea baltica
(Fig. 9, No.11). It is located in original position in Ligia
oceanica, but missing in that position in Idotea baltica. We
do not know about the fate of trnR in Ligia oceanica, but in
Idotea baltica it was also subject to a translocation (Fig. 9,
No. 10).
It is noticeable that in Ligia oceanica all translocated genes
found their new position in a segment comprising about
one third of the complete genome (between trnA and
trnH). This area bears a cluster of tRNA genes in the ancestral gene order of arthropods. It seems to be a "hot spot"
of genome rearrangements in arthropods [19,20].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/241

Conclusion
The first complete mitochondrial genome sequence of a
peracarid arthropod, the isopod Ligia oceanica, shows the
usual compact and circular organization known from
other Metazoa. Gene order is not conserved among peracarids and even not among isopods. In Ligia oceanica 11
genes plus the control region have changed their relative
positions in comparison to the pancrustacean ground pattern, implying to be the result of nine gene translocation
events. No gene translocation is shared with the amphipod Parhyale hawaiiensis, whereas eight gene translocations were probably already present in the common
ancestor of Ligia oceanica and another isopod, Idotea baltica. Both isopod mitochondrial genomes differ by the
position of three tRNA genes (trnR, trnV, trnN) and share
an inverted strand bias of nucleotide frequencies compared to other malacostracan crustaceans. Reason for this
is probably an inversion of the replication origin. This is
confirmed by the fact that the typical hairpin-like secondary structure commonly found in mitochondrial control
regions is found in opposite orientation compared to
other crustacean species.
A broad survey of mitochondrial gene rearrangements in
Crustacea reveals a great variation of gene order. Characters derived from gene order (= gene translocations, inversions or duplications) do not solve overall phylogenetic
relationships between major crustacean subtaxa. However, they will probably be helpful in analyses of internal
phylogeny of some of these subtaxa (Cirripedia, Brachyura, Peracarida), when more data will be provided.

Methods
Sample and DNA extraction
A specimen of Ligia oceanica originally collected at the
coast of the North Sea island Helgoland (Germany) and
preserved in 99% ethanol was utilized for the DNA extraction process. 2–3 pleopods were applied to the DNeasy
Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer's protocol to receive the total genomic DNA.
PCR primers
The first partial mitogenomic sequences were obtained by
using two insect based primer pairs N4 + 16S2 and CytB +
N4(87) [69]. Additional intragenetic parts of cox1, cox3,
nd4, nad5, rrnL and rrnS were determined by using six
crustacean primer pairs [25,70]. The remaining gaps were
closed by making use of specific primer pairs designed
according to the sequences of the aforementioned genes
(for primer sequences see additional file 2). Larger PCR
products were sequenced by primer walking strategy. To
abbreviate this longsome process two longer PCR products were sequenced with the primer pairs S1–S19 from a
set of primers which was successfully applied to decapod

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:241

crustaceans [71]. All primers were purchased from Metabion (München, Germany).
PCR and purification of PCR products
The PCRs were performed with an Eppendorf Mastercycler
or Eppendorf Mastercycler Gradient. The cycling was set
up with an initial denaturation step at 94°C for 2 minutes, followed by 40 cycles comprising denaturation at
94°C for 30 seconds, annealing at 45–52°C (primer specific) for 1 minute and elongation at 72° for 2–5 minutes
depending on the expected length of the PCR product.
The process was completed with a final elongation at
68°C for 2 minutes. The reaction volume amounted 50 µl
containing 1 µl dNTP mix (Eppendorf), 0.25 µl HotMasterTaq DNA polymerase (5 U/µl; Eppendorf), 5 µl HotMasterTaq buffer (Eppendorf), 1 µl primer mix (10 µM
each), 1 µl DNA template and 41.75 µl sterilized distilled
water (Eppendorf). The PCR products were separated with
a 1% TBE agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide and
inspected subsequently under UV transillumination.

For the purification of the PCR Products the QIAquick
PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) as well as the Blue Matrix
DNA Purification Kit (Eurx) were used. Abiding to the
manufacturers protocols both kits produced equivalent
yields. All PCR products were stored at -20°C until
sequencing was performed.
Cloning and transformation
In one case a single PCR fragment, due to low sequence
signal quality, ranging from rrnS to cob, which contained
the major non-coding region, was sequenced after cloning
with the pGEM-T Easy Vector System (Promega). We followed the manufacturers protocol with the exception that
half volumes (5 µl) were used for the cloning reaction. For
the transformation Escherichia coli XL-gold (Stratagene)
were used. Colonies that contained recombinant plasmids were identified with selection plates (LB/ampicillin/
IPTG/X-Gal). To verify insertion of the PCR product, few
cells were applied to a Colony PCR using the vector primers M13F and M13R. The reaction volume amounted 20
µl with aforementioned PCR ingredients added proportionally. The colony-cycling consisted of an initial denaturation step (10 minutes, 95°C) followed by 25 cycles of
denaturation (30 seconds, 94°C), annealing (30 seconds,
46°C) and elongation (4 minutes, 68°C). The colony
PCR was closed by a final elongation (3 minutes, 68°C).
The result was inspected with an agarose gel under UV
transillumination. Positive tested colonies were proliferated in a LB/ampicillin Medium. Subsequently the plasmids were extracted with the Quantum Prep Kit (Bio Rad)
and finally stored at -20°C.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/241

Sequencing and sequence analysis
Cycle sequencing reactions were performed with the CEQ
DTCS Quick Start Kit (Beckman Coulter) following the
manufacturers protocols. The same primers and thermocyclers were used as in PCRs. The temperature profile
included 30 cycles comprising denaturation at 94°C for
20 seconds, annealing at 45–52°C (primer specific) for 20
seconds and elongation at 60°C for 4 minutes. Plasmids
were preheated additionally before the sequencing reaction (96°C for 1 minute). The separation was executed by
a CEQ 8000 cappillary sequencer (Beckman Coulter) and
analyzed with the appendant CEQ software (software version: 5.0.360, instrument version: 6.0.2).
Gene annotation and sequence analysis
The alignment of the fragments to complete the whole
mitochondrial DNA sequence was done in BioEdit 7.0.5.2
[72]. Each partial sequence was ascertained twice at least
to prevent sequencing faults. Ambiguous base pairs were
validated manually referring to chromatograms. Gene
identification was determined by BLAST search on GenBank databases [73] and by comparison to the mitochondrial Genome of Drosophila yakuba (NC001322).
Boundaries of the protein coding genes were determined
with a multiple alignment of other crustacean amino acid
sequences. It was assumed that they were specified by the
first start and stop codons in frame. Transfer RNA genes
were determined with tRNAscan-SE 1.21 [41] or by eye
inspection for anti-codon sequences and secondary structures in regions between identified genes. Hairpin structures in non-coding regions were also identified by eye
inspection. The control region and RNA genes were
assumed to extend to adjacent genes, due to the lack of
resources for a better determination of their boundaries.
Nucleotide frequencies of protein coding and RNA genes
were calculated with the DAMBE software package [74],
effective number of codons was determined according to
[40] with INCA 1.20 [75]. The complete genome sequence
is submitted to NCBI GenBank [GenBank:DQ442914].
