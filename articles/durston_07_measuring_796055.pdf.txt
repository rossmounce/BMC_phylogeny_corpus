Abstract
Background: Abel and Trevors have delineated three aspects of sequence complexity, Random
Sequence Complexity (RSC), Ordered Sequence Complexity (OSC) and Functional Sequence
Complexity (FSC) observed in biosequences such as proteins. In this paper, we provide a method
to measure functional sequence complexity.
Methods and Results: We have extended Shannon uncertainty by incorporating the data variable
with a functionality variable. The resulting measured unit, which we call Functional bit (Fit), is
calculated from the sequence data jointly with the defined functionality variable. To demonstrate
the relevance to functional bioinformatics, a method to measure functional sequence complexity
was developed and applied to 35 protein families. Considerations were made in determining how
the measure can be used to correlate functionality when relating to the whole molecule and submolecule. In the experiment, we show that when the proposed measure is applied to the aligned
protein sequences of ubiquitin, 6 of the 7 highest value sites correlate with the binding domain.
Conclusion: For future extensions, measures of functional bioinformatics may provide a means to
evaluate potential evolving pathways from effects such as mutations, as well as analyzing the internal
structural and functional relationships within the 3-D structure of proteins.

Background
There has been increasing recognition that genes deal with
information processing. They have been referred to as
"subroutines within a much larger operating system". For
this reason, approaches previously reserved for computer
science are now increasingly being applied to computational biology [1]. If genes can be thought of as information-processing subroutines, then proteins can be
analyzed in terms of the products of information interacting with laws of physics. It may be possible to advance our
knowledge of proteins, such as their structure and func-

tions, by examining the patterns of functional information when studying a protein family.
Our proposed method is based on mathematical and
computational concepts (e.g., measures). We show here
that, at least in some cases in sequence analysis, the proposed measure is useful in analyzing protein families with
interpretable experimental results.

Sequence Complexity (RSC), Ordered Sequence Complexity (OSC) and Functional Sequence Complexity
(FSC). RSC corresponds to stochastic ensembles with
minimal physicochemical bias and little or no tendency
toward functional free-energy binding. OSC is usually patterned either by the natural regularities described by physical laws or by statistically weighted means. For example,
a physico-chemical self-ordering tendency creates redundant patterns such as highly-patterned polysaccharides
and the polyadenosines adsorbed onto montmorillonite
[4]. Repeating motifs, with or without biofunction, result
in observed OSC in nucleic acid sequences. The redundancy in OSC can, in principle, be compressed by an algorithm shorter than the sequence itself. As Abel and Trevors
have pointed out, neither RSC nor OSC, or any combination of the two, is sufficient to describe the functional
complexity observed in living organisms, for neither
includes the additional dimension of functionality, which
is essential for life [5]. FSC includes the dimension of
functionality [2,3]. Szostak [6] argued that neither Shannon's original measure of uncertainty [7] nor the measure
of algorithmic complexity [8] are sufficient. Shannon's
classical information theory does not consider the meaning, or function, of a message. Algorithmic complexity
fails to account for the observation that 'different molecular structures may be functionally equivalent'. For this reason, Szostak suggested that a new measure of
information–functional information–is required [6].
Chiu, Wong, and Cheung also discussed the insufficiency
of Shannon uncertainty [9,10] when applied to measuring outcomes of variables. The differences between RSC,
OSC and FSC in living organisms are necessary and useful
in describing biosequences of living organisms.
Consider two main uses for the proposed method for
measuring FSC, which incorporates functionality: 1) comparative analysis of biosequence subgroups when explicit
time lag is known; and 2) typicality analysis between
biosequence subgroups when there is no explicit time lag.
In the first case, such as an evolutionary time scale, an
increase or decrease in FSC between an earlier gene or protein and a later gene or protein can be measured, evaluating its possible degradations and/or functional effects due
to various changes such as insertions, deletions, mutations and rearrangements. In the second case, a large set of
aligned sequences representing a protein family can be
subdivided according to phylogenetic relationships
derived from typicality of species groupings and the FSC
for each subgroup measured. This is important when evaluating the emergence or evolution of viral or microbial
strains with novel functions such as in the comparisons of
the Chlamydia family genomes [11]. An analysis may
reveal the extent of the difference in FSC between one
functional group and the other, as well as the modular

http://www.tbiomed.com/content/4/1/47

interactions of the internal relationship structure of the
sequences [12].
The ability to measure FSC would be a significant advance
in the ability to identify, analyze, compare, and predict
the metabolic utility of biopolymeric sequences. Mutational drift, emerging pathogenic viral and microbial species/strains, generated mutations, acquired heritable
diseases and mutagenic effects could all be evaluated
quantitatively. Furthermore, In vitro experiments using
SELEX [13-15] to study transitions in possible early
ribozyme family growth could then be evaluated in a
quantitative, as well as qualitative and intuitive fashion.
Evolutionary changes, both actual and theoretical, can
also be evaluated using FSC.
It is known that the variability of data can be measured
using Shannon uncertainty [16]. However, Shannon's
original formulation when applied to biological
sequences does not express variations related to biological
functionality such as metabolic utility. Shannon uncertainty, however, can be extended to measure the joint variable (X, F), where X represents the variability of data, and
F functionality. This explicitly incorporates empirical
knowledge of metabolic function into the measure that is
usually important for evaluating sequence complexity.
This measure of both the observed data and a conceptual
variable of function jointly can be called Functional Uncertainty (Hf) [17], and is defined by the equation:
H(Xf(t)) = -∑P(Xf(t)) logP(Xf(t))

(1)

where Xf denotes the conditional variable of the given
sequence data (X) on the described biological function f
which is an outcome of the variable (F). For example, a set
of 2,442 aligned sequences of proteins belonging to the
ubiquitin protein family (used in the experiment later)
can be assumed to satisfy the same specified function f,
where f might represent the known 3-D structure of the
ubiquitin protein family, or some other function common to ubiquitin. The entire set of aligned sequences that
satisfies that function, therefore, constitutes the outcomes
of Xf. Here, functionality relates to the whole protein family which can be inputted from a database. The advantage
of using H(Xf(t)) is that changes in the functionality characteristics can be incorporated and analyzed. Furthermore, the data can be a single monomer, or a
biosequence, or an entire set of aligned sequences all having the same common function. The significance of the
statistical variations can then be evaluated if necessary [8].
The state variable t, representing time or a sequence of
ordered events, can be fixed, discrete, or continuous. Discrete changes may be represented as discrete time states.

Functional bioinformatics is emerging as an important
area of research [18-20]. Even though the term 'biological
function' has been freely used for specific experimentation, there is no generally consistent usage of the term.
According to Karp [21], biological functionality can refer
to biochemical specified reactions, cellular responses, and
structural properties of proteins and nucleic acids. It can
be defined or specified at the global level (i.e., the entire
organism), locally at the sub-molecular level, or applicable to the whole molecule. Hence confusion exists in
interpreting its meaning. Karp [21] recognized that biological function is a complex concept. Using Webster, he
refers to 'specially fitted' action or 'normal and specific
contribution' of a part to the economy of the whole. Function can be related to cellular components (e.g., macromolecules, proteins or small molecules) that interact and
catalyze biochemical transformations. In specific applications, it can be a local function of an enzyme such as the
substrate that is acted on, or the ligands that activate or
inhibit the enzyme. In more systemic integrated functions, it may refer to pathways, single or multiple, in a
hierarchical, nested scope [22,23]. In general, it is a challenge 'to define a single best set of biologically acceptable
rules for performing this decomposition' [21].
In our approach, we leave the specific defined meaning of
functionality as an input to the application, in reference to
the whole sequence family. It may represent a particular
domain, or the whole protein structure, or any specified
function with respect to the cell. Mathematically, it is
defined precisely as an outcome of a discrete-valued variable, denoted as F={f}. The set of outcomes can be
thought of as specified biological states. They are presumed non-overlapping, but can be extended to be fuzzy
elements. In order to get a meaningful calculation in
measuring FSC, the measure should be statistically significant in practice [7,10], much larger than zero when relating to the sequences. When sequences are chosen that are
unrelated to the function to be analyzed, or are simply
arbitrarily ordered or randomly generated sequences, then
the measure of FSC will be small and statistically not significant. For example, if many sequences that do not share
the same function f, are mistakenly included within an
aligned set representing some particular function, we
should expect the measure of FSC of that set to be
degraded, possibly even to a very small value. However,
when the specified functionality is chosen meaningfully
(even in part), then FSC can be interpreted.
Consider further, when a biosequence is mutated, the
mutating sequence can be compared at two different time
states going from ti to tj. For example, ti could represent an
ancestral gene and tj a current mutant allele. Different
sequences sharing the same function f (as outcomes of the
variables denoted respectively as Xf, Yf) can also be com-

http://www.tbiomed.com/content/4/1/47

pared at the same time t. Within a sequence, any change
of a monomer in the sequence represents a single step
change that may or may not affect the overall function.
Sequence reversals, gene splits, lateral transfers, and multiple point mutations can also be quantified between the
two states ti, tj. The limits of the change in functional
uncertainty between the two states can then be evaluated
at t = ti and t = tj.
The change in functional uncertainty (denoted as ΔHf)
between two states can be defined as
ΔH (Xg(ti), Xf(tj)) = H(Xg(tj)) - H(Xf(ti))

(2)

where Xf (ti) and Xg (tj) can be applied to the same
sequence at two different times or to two different
sequences at the same time. ΔHf can then quantify the
change in functional uncertainty between two biopolymeric
states with regard to biological functionality. Unrelated biomolecules with the same function or the same sequence
evolving a new or additional function through genetic
drift can be compared and analyzed. A measure of ΔHf can
increase, decrease, or remain unchanged.
Biological function is mostly, though not entirely determined by the organism's genetic instructions [24-26]. The
function could theoretically arise stochastically through
mutational changes coupled with selection pressure, or
through human experimenter involvement [13-15]. A
time limit can be set in some situations to evaluate what
changes to Xf(ti) might be possible within that limit. For
example, an estimation of the evolutionary limits projected over the next 10 years could be computed in this
approach for any particular strain of the HIV virus. The
specifics of the function (as an outcome of the function
variable) can remain constant, or it can be permitted to
vary within a range of efficiency. The limit may be determined by what is permitted metabolically. There is often
a minimum limit of catalytic efficiency required by the
organism for a given function.
The ground state g (an outcome of F) of a system is the state
of presumed highest uncertainty (not necessarily equally
probable) permitted by the constraints of the physical system, when no specified biological function is required or
present. Certain physical systems may constrain the
number of options in the ground state so that not all possible sequences are equally probable [27]. An example of
a highly constrained ground state resulting in a highly
ordered sequence occurs when the phosphorimidazolide
of adenosine is added daily to a decameric primer bound
to montmorillonite clay, producing a perfectly ordered,
50-mer sequence of polyadenosine [3]. In this case, the
ground state permits only one single possible sequence.
Since the ground state represents the state of presumed

http://www.tbiomed.com/content/4/1/47

highest uncertainty permitted by the physical constraints
of the system, the set of functional options, if there are
any, will therefore be a subset of the permitted options,
assuming the constraints for the physical system remain
constant. If the ground state permits only one sequence,
then there is no possibility of change in the functional
uncertainty of the system.
The null state, a possible outcome of F denoted as ø, is
defined here as a special case of the ground state of highest
uncertainly when the physical system imposes no constraints at all, resulting in the equi-probability of all possible
sequences or options. Such sequencing has been called
"dynamically inert, dynamically decoupled, or dynamically incoherent" [28,29]. For example, the ground state
of a 300 amino acid protein family can be represented by
a completely random 300 amino acid sequence where
functional constraints have been loosened such that any
of the 20 amino acids will suffice at any of the 300 sites.
From Eqn. (1) the functional uncertainty of the null state
is represented as
H(Xø(ti))= - ∑P(Xø(ti)) log P(Xø(ti))

(3)

where (Xø(ti)) is the conditional variable for all possible
equiprobable sequences. Consider the number of all possible sequences is denoted by W. Letting the length of
each sequence be denoted by N and the number of possible options at each site in the sequence be denoted by m,
W = mN. For example, for a protein of length N = 257 and
assuming that the number of possible options at each site
is m = 20, W = 20257. Since, for the null state, we are
requiring that there are no constraints and all possible
sequences are equally probable, P(Xø(ti)) = 1/W and

value for the measured FSC of protein motifs can be calculated by relating the joint (X, F) pattern to a stochastic
ensemble, the null state in the case of biopolymers that
includes any random string from the sequence space.
A. Functional uncertainty as a measure of FSC
The measure of Functional Sequence Complexity,
denoted as ζ, is defined as the change in functional uncertainty from the ground state H(Xg(ti)) to the functional
state H(Xf(ti)), or

ζ = ΔH (Xg(ti), Xf(tj)).

(6)

The resulting unit of measure is defined on the joint data
and functionality variable, which we call Fits (or Functional bits). The unit Fit thus defined is related to the intuitive concept of functional information, including genetic
instruction and, thus, provides an important distinction
between functional information and Shannon information [6,32].
Eqn. (6) describes a measure to calculate the functional
information of the whole molecule, that is, with respect to
the functionality of the protein considered. The functionality of the protein can be known and is consistent with
the whole protein family, given as inputs from the database. However, the functionality of a sub-sequence or particular sites of a molecule can be substantially different
[12]. The functionality of a sub-molecule, though clearly
extremely important, has to be identified and discovered.
This problem of estimating the functionality as well as
where it is expressed at the sub-molecular level is currently
an active area of research in our group.

(5)

To avoid the complication of considering functionality at
the sub-molecular level, we crudely assume that each site
in a molecule, when calculated to have a high measure of
FSC, correlates with the functionality of the whole molecule. The measure of FSC of the whole molecule, is then
the total sum of the measured FSC for each site in the
aligned sequences.

Physical constraints increase order and change the ground
state away from the null state, restricting freedom of selection and reducing functional sequencing possibilities, as
mentioned earlier. The genetic code, for example, makes
the synthesis and use of certain amino acids more probable than others, which could influence the ground state
for proteins. However, for proteins, the data indicates
that, although amino acids may naturally form a nonrandom sequence when polymerized in a dilute solution of
amino acids [30], actual dipeptide frequencies and single
nucleotide frequencies in proteins are closer to random
than ordered [31]. For this reason, the ground state for
biosequences can be approximated by the null state. The

Consider that there are usually only 20 different amino
acids possible per site for proteins, Eqn. (6) can be used to
calculate a maximum Fit value/protein amino acid site of
4.32 Fits/site. We use the formula log (20) - H(Xf) to calculate the functional information at a site specified by the
variable Xf such that Xf corresponds to the aligned amino
acids of each sequence with the same molecular function
f. The measured FSC for the whole protein is then calculated as the summation of that for all aligned sites. The
number of Fits quantifies the degree of algorithmic challenge, in terms of probability, in achieving needed metabolic function. For example, if we find that the Ribosomal
S12 protein family has a Fit value of 379, we can use the

H(Xø(ti))= - ∑(1/W) log (1/W) = log W.

(4)

The change in functional uncertainty from the null state
is, therefore,
ΔH(Xø(ti), Xf(tj)) = log (W) - H(Xf(ti)).

equations presented thus far to predict that there are
about 1049 different 121-residue sequences that could fall
into the Ribsomal S12 family of proteins, resulting in an
evolutionary search target of approximately 10-106 percent
of 121-residue sequence space. In general, the higher the
Fit value, the more functional information is required to
encode the particular function in order to find it in
sequence space. A high Fit value for individual sites within
a protein indicates sites that require a high degree of functional information. High Fit values may also point to the
key structural or binding sites within the overall 3-D structure. Since the functional uncertainty, as defined by Eqn.
(1) is proportional to the -log of the probability, we can
see that the cost of a linear increase in FSC is an exponential decrease in probability.

used as an estimate for the overall FSC value for the entire
protein and compared with other proteins.

For the current approach, both equi-probability of monomer availability/reactivity and independence of selection
at each site within the strand can be assumed as a starting
point, using the null state as our ground state. For the
functional state, however, an a posteriori probability estimate based on the given aligned sequence ensemble must
be made. Although there are a variety of methods to estimate P(Xf(t)), the method we use here, as an approximation, is as follows. First, a set of aligned sequences with the
same presumed function, is produced by methods such as
CLUSTAL, downloaded from Pfam. Since real sequence
data is used, the effect of the genetic code on amino acid
frequency is already incorporated into the outcome. Let
the total number of sequences with the specified function
in the set be denoted by M. The data set can be represented
by the N-tuple X = (X1, ... XN) where N denotes the aligned
sequence length as mentioned earlier. The total number of
occurrences, denoted by d, of a specific amino acid "aa" in
a given site is computed. An estimate for the probability
that the given amino acid will occur in that site Xi,
denoted by P(Xi = "aa") is then made by dividing the
number of occurrences d by M, or,

From Eqn. (6), the FSC of a biosequence can be measured
as it changes with time, as shown in Figure 1. When measuring evolutionary change in terms of FSC, it is necessary
to account for a change in function due to insertions, deletions, substitutions and shuffling. Evolutionary change
that involves a change from a non-functional state that is
not in the null state, or from an existing function fa to a
modified function fb that is either different in terms of efficiency or function, is given by

P(Xi = "aa") = d/M.

(7)

For example, if in a set of 2,134 aligned sequences, we
observe that proline occurs 351 times at the third site,
then P ("proline") = 351/2,134. Note that P ("proline") is
a conditional probability for that site variable on condition of the presumed function f. This is calculated for each
amino acid for all sites. The functional uncertainty of the
amino acids in a given site is then computed using Eqn.
(1) using the estimated probabilities for each amino acid
observed. The Fit value for that site is then obtained by
subtracting the functional uncertainty of that site from the
null state, in this case using Eqn. (4), log20. The individual Fit values for each site can be tabulated and analyzed.
The summed total of the fitness values for each site can be

B. Measuring changes in FSC
In principle, some proteins may change from a non-functional state to a functional state gradually as their
sequences change. Furthermore, iso-enzymes in some
cases may catalyze the same reaction, but have different
sequences. Also, certain enzymes may demonstrate variations in both their sequence and their function. Finally, a
single mutation in a functional sequence can sometimes
render the sequence non-functional relative to the original function. An example of this effect has been observed
in experiments with the ultrabiothorax (Ubx) protein
[17,33].

ζE = ΔH (Xfa(ti), Xfb(tj)).

(8)

The sequences (corresponding to Xfa with initial function
fa) have two components to it, relative to that of Xfb (with
resulting mutated function fb). The static component is that
portion of the subsequence that must remain within the
permitted sequence variation of the original biosequence
with function fa while, at the same time, enabling the new
function fb. The mutating component is the portion of Xfa
that must change to achieve either the new function fb,
where the new function is to be understood as either a
new level of efficiency for the existing function, or a novel
function different from fa. This is a convenient simplification, assuming that the two components are separate
according to the aligned sites. Currently we are also studying scenarios when the two components may be mixed,
possibly at different times. The mutating component can
be assumed to be in the null state relative to the resulting
sequences of Xfb. Since the mutating component is the
only part that must change, we can ignore the static component provided we include the probability of it remaining
static during the mutational changes of the mutating component.
In practice, the sequence space for possible novel functional states may not be known. However, by considering
particular proteins, estimated mutation rates, population
size, and time, an estimated value for the probability can
be chosen and substituted into the relevant components

Changing measure of FSC over time
Changing measure of FSC over time. The measured value ζ of a biosequence S can change over time with mutation
events. Changes in FSC between ti and tj may indicate changes in the amount of order or randomness of the sequence. If OSC
and RSC are represented as a continuum (as shown at left), a functional sequence at time t will have a FSC and time value as
well as OSC/RSC values. If, as shown at right, OSC, RSC, FSC and time are represented as a 4-dimensional space, then a functional sequence S(ti) will have discrete FSC, OSC, RSC and time values.

of Eqn. (9) to limit search areas around known biosequences that are observed, such as protein structural
domains, to see what other possible states within that
range might have some selective advantage. In this way,
possible evolutionary paths for the formation of certain
protein families might be reconstructed. For example,
using this method, it might be possible to predict, say,
future viral strains within certain limits.
Intuitively, the greater the reduction in FSC a mutation
produces, the more likely the mutation is deleterious to
the given function. This can be evaluated using known
mutations introduced individually into a set of aligned,
wild-type sequences to measure the change in FSC. The
results could then be ranked. Operating under the
hypothesis that mutations producing the greatest decrease
in FSC are most likely to be deleterious, experimental
investigations into certain genes with certain mutations
could be prioritized according to how negatively they
affect FSC.

Results and Discussion
For the 35 protein families analyzed, a measure of FSC in
Fits for each site was computed from their aligned
sequence data on PFAM. The results for the families, as
well as an array of randomly (uniformly) generated

sequences and an ordered 50-mer polyadenosine
sequence are shown in Table 1. They reveal significant
aspects of FSC described below.
First, as observed in Table 1, although we might expect
larger proteins to have a higher FSC, that is not always the
case. For example, 342-residue SecY has a FSC of 688 Fits,
but the smaller 240-residue RecA actually has a larger FSC
of 832 Fits. The Fit density (Fits/amino acid) is, therefore,
lower in SecY than in RecA. This indicates that RecA is
likely more functionally complex than SecY. The results
for the array of random sequences and for a 50-mer polyadenosine sequence formed on Montmorillonite show
that ΔHf distinguishes FSC from RSC and OSC. The results
for the array of random sequences are shown in the second from the last row of Table 1, and indicate that random sequences, which are an example of RSC, tend to
have an FSC of approximately 0 Fits. The results of the
highly ordered 50-mer polyadenosine, which is an example of OSC, are shown in the last row of Table 1, and indicate an FSC of approximately 0 Fits. This is consistent with
Abel and Trevors' prediction that neither OSC nor RSC
can contain the functional sequence complexity observed
in biosequences.

Results for 35 protein families Shown above are the 35 protein families analyzed, their sequence length (column 1), the number of sequences
analyzed for each family (column 2), the Shannon uncertainty of the Null State Hø (Eqn. 4) for each protein (column 3), the FSC value ζ in Fits for
each protein (column 4), and the average Fit value/site (FSC/length, column 5). For comparison, the results for a set of uniformly random amino acid
sequences (RSC) are shown in the second from last row, and a highly ordered, 50-mer polyadenosine sequence (OSC) in the last row. All values,
except for the OSC example, which was calculated from the constrained ground state required to produce OSC, were computed from the null
state. The Fit values obtained can be discussed as the measure of the change in functional uncertainty required to specify any functional sequence
that falls into the given family being analyzed.

A plot of FSC vs. protein length for the 35 selected protein
families is shown in Figure 2. The x-intercept was found to
be approximately 23 amino acids. For the 35 protein families analyzed, there were no points corresponding to any
protein families in the lower right area of the plot. The
right hand plot in Figure 2 shows the average number of
Fits/site for the 35 protein families analyzed. For our
small sample of 35 protein families, we found no points
between 0 and 1.3 Fits/site.

To demonstrate some ways in which our approach can be
applied to proteins, ubiquitin was chosen. A sample plot
of FITs/site and amino acid conservation for each site, is
shown in Figure 3 for Ubiquitin. Data for the first 5 sites
in the aligned set was not available from PFAM. The conservation value was obtained by subtracting the total
number of different options observed at a given site, from
the total possible options. In this case, 20 different amino
acids. If all 20 amino acids were permitted at a site, then
the conservation value was 0. A maximum value of 19
would obtain if only 1 amino acid was observed at the

Measuring FSC for 35 protein families
Measuring FSC for 35 protein families. The left plot shows the FSC with respect to the length of the aligned proteins. The
x-intercept of a fitted line trace back to an approximate protein length of 23 amino acids. It also shows an absence of points in
the lower right corner. The right plot shows the "density" (measure of FSC/aligned sequence length).

site. From Figure 3, it can be observed that a high conservation value usually corresponded to a high measured
FSC value. The measurement is also affected by the
number of amino acids observed which could be different
for different sites. For example, site 37 shows 20 observed
amino acids, but still a relatively high value of 2.9 Fits.
Conservation of a site reflects the degree of variations
which is affected by both the number of observed amino
acids and their frequency of observation in the alignment
[12]. For example, if a site is observed to be dominated by
only a few amino acids even though all the amino acid
types are observed, its measured FSC could still be high.
From the plot in Figure 3, one can observe which sites
have higher measured FSC value. An arbitrary lower cutoff
limit of 3.32 Fits/site was chosen to indicate high measured FSC sites, presumed to be significantly associated
with the functionality of the whole molecule. A more rigorous statistical analysis can also be used as well as other
types of measures based on dependency [12]. All sites
exceeding that lower cutoff value were examined. A total
of seven sites were found that had a high value that was
between 3.32 Fits/site and the maximum of 4.32 Fits/site.
These sites were located on a 3-D model of ubiquitin
(1AAR.pdb) as shown in Figure 4. Out of the 7 sites, 6
where located on the binding domain containing the
binding site Lys-48 [34]. The site with the maximum FIT
value was site 47, immediately next to the binding site.
Surprisingly, the binding site itself was poorly conserved,

with an amino acid conservation value of only 1, albeit a
relatively high value of 2.91 Fits. Five of the remaining 6
sites were found to be clustered in the area of the binding
site, with bonds between Leu-50 and Leu-43, as well as
between Gly-41, Lys-27, and Asp-52, as shown in Figure 5.
Since these sites had the highest FSC values in ubiquitin,
we infer that they play a critical role in either binding, or
in the structure of the binding site domain for that protein. The fact that of the top seven sites, one was immediately adjacent to the binding site, and five others were
located on the structure supporting the binding site lends
support for our hypothesis that high FIT values can be
used to locate key functional components of a protein
family.
In this paper, we have presented an important advance in
the measurement of the FSC of biopolymers. It was
assumed that aligned sequences from the same Pfam family, could be assigned the same functionality label. Even
though the same functionality may not be applicable to
individual sites, site independence and significance was
assumed and the measured FSC of each site was summed.
However, further extension of the method should be considered [12,35]. For example, if dependency of joint
occurrences is detected between the outcomes of two variables X3 and X4 in the aligned sequences, then the N-tuple
representation of the sequences could be transformed into
a new R-tuple YR where these outcomes of X3 and X4 are
represented as outcome by a single variable Y3 as shown in

Figure
Measure3of FSC/site for ubiquitin
Measure of FSC/site for ubiquitin. The plot shows how the FSC value varies between sites for a protein family of ubiquitin.
At site 37, all 20 amino acids are observed, with a relatively high Fit value of 2.9. It indicates that measure of FSC also depends
on the number of amino acid types observed as well as the distribution of frequencies of each type.

Figure 6. An outcome of the two variables in X3 and X4 correspond to a hypercell in YR. A more accurate estimate of
FSC could then be calculated. We are currently considering this more general scenario.
The measurement in Fits of the FSC provides significant
information about how specific each monomer in the
sequence must be to provide the needed/normal biofunction. The functional information measures the degree of
challenge involved in searching the sequence space for a
sequence capable of performing the function. In addition,
Fits can be summed for every sequence required to achieve
a complete functional biochemical pathway and integrated cellular metabolism, including regulatory proteins.
In principle, it may be possible to estimate a FSC value for
an entire prokaryotic cell where the genome has been
sequenced and all translated proteins are known. Simpler
genomes in viruses may be an excellent example for this
kind of analysis. That is, further analysis of the FSC values
will provide a starting point to reveal important information about the processes for an entire organism such as the
virus.

Conclusion
A mathematical measure of functional information, in
units of Fits, of the functional sequence complexity
observed in protein family biosequences has been
designed and evaluated. This measure has been applied to
diverse protein families to obtain estimates of their FSC.
The Fit values we calculated ranged from 0, which
describes no functional sequence complexity, to as high as
2,400 that described the transition to functional complexity. This method successfully distinguishes between FSC
and OSC, RSC, thus, distinguishing between order, randomness, and biological function.

Methods
The following is a brief summary of the methods used
(additional file 1). A more detailed description is available as an online supplement. Eqn. (6) was applied to 35
protein families or protein domain families, to estimate
the value of the FSC for any protein included within that
family. A program was written, using Python, to analyze
the two-dimensional array of aligned sequences for a protein family and is available online (additional files 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, and 9). The data for the arrays was obtained

Calculated bonds for high Fit value sites in binding domain. A 3rd-order component was observed between Lys-27,
Gln-41, and Asp-52 which appears to help conform the beta strand/loop leading to the binding site. The bonded pair Leu-43
and Leu-50 help conform the beta strand and loop leading away from the binding site. These 5 sites were among the 7 highest
Fit value sites for ubiquitin suggesting that they play a critical role in conforming the binding domain. (Bonds were computed
