Abstract
Background: To explore the potential value of high-throughput genotyping assays in the analysis
of large and complex genomes, we designed two highly multiplexed Illumina bead arrays using the
GoldenGate SNP assay for gene mapping in white spruce (Picea glauca [Moench] Voss) and black
spruce (Picea mariana [Mill.] B.S.P.).
Results: Each array included 768 SNPs, identified by resequencing genomic DNA from parents of
each mapping population. For white spruce and black spruce, respectively, 69.2% and 77.1% of
genotyped SNPs had valid GoldenGate assay scores and segregated in the mapping populations. For
each of these successful SNPs, on average, valid genotyping scores were obtained for over 99% of
progeny. SNP data were integrated to pre-existing ALFP, ESTP, and SSR markers to construct two
individual linkage maps and a composite map for white spruce and black spruce genomes. The white
spruce composite map contained 821 markers including 348 gene loci. Also, 835 markers including
328 gene loci were positioned on the black spruce composite map. In total, 215 anchor markers
(mostly gene markers) were shared between the two species. Considering lineage divergence at
least 10 Myr ago between the two spruces, interspecific comparison of homoeologous linkage
groups revealed remarkable synteny and marker colinearity.
Conclusion: The design of customized highly multiplexed Illumina SNP arrays appears as an
efficient procedure to enhance the mapping of expressed genes and make linkage maps more
informative and powerful in such species with poorly known genomes. This genotyping approach
will open new avenues for co-localizing candidate genes and QTLs, partial genome sequencing, and
comparative mapping across conifers.

Background
Single nucleotide polymorphims (SNPs) have become a
genomic commodity as they are becoming indispensable
in various genome scans aimed at mapping genomes [16], finding associations with complex traits [7-10], and
population genomics [11,12]. They are distributed along
the various regions of the genomes [13,14] and are frequent in coding regions of angiosperms [15,16] and conifers [17-19]. However, the efficiency of genome scans is
not only dependant on a wide genomic distribution of
SNPs. Indeed, it also relies on the ability to genotype large
numbers of SNPs over large sets of individuals.
SNP genome scans in non model species usually involve
two steps: the discovery of SNPs and genotyping. With no
a priori knowledge of DNA polymorphisms, SNPs are usually discovered through various strategies of individual or
pool DNA sequencing [20], or by using tilling techniques,
a high-throughput strategy relying on the enzymatic cleavage of mismatches [21]. For a number of crop species, current resequencing efforts have led to the development of
SNP databases and generate a wealth of SNPs usable in
genome scans. In conifers, large-scale EST sequencing
projects have been initiated [22-25], providing a starting
point to develop SNP resources in pine [17] and spruce
[18].
Several SNP genotyping array approaches have been
developed with variable success. The accuracy of innovative SNP genotyping technologies has been assessed
mostly through the development of assays suitable for
analysing variations in the human genome. Broadly
speaking, four reaction principles govern SNP genotyping
assays: hybridization with allele-specific oligonucleotide
probes, oligonucleotide ligation, single nucleotide primer
extension, and enzymatic cleavage reviewed in [26-28].
Among these approaches, the GoldenGate assay developed by Illumina and relying on the bead array technology has demonstrated high performance with high levels
of call rate, reproducibility, and overall success rate for the
analysis of the human genome [29-31].
High-throughput SNP assays have recently been applied
to plants. Large datasets of SNP-based markers are being
developed in barley through the development of genotyping assays relying on Illumina's technologies [32], leading
to the undertaking of an international SNP project [33].
The same genotyping approach has made it possible to
map large datasets of SNPs even in complex and duplicated genomes such as soybean [34], and projects are
underway in hexaploid wheat [35] and poplar [36].
In the present study, we are asking whether high-throughput SNP genotyping technologies developed for human
population genomics applications, such as the Illumina

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/21

GoldenGate SNP assay, are applicable to large and essentially unsequenced genomes as seen in conifers. Conifer
genomes reach very large sizes, around 10,000–40,000
Mb [37], consisting mostly of repetitive sequences [38].
For the two conifers considered herein, white spruce and
black spruce, genome sizes are well in excess of 10e10 bp
[39].
Moreover, the partial knowledge of the large and redundant genomes of conifers can be a limiting factor to design
an efficient SNP genotyping assay. Indeed, sequences
located upstream and downstream the SNP cannot be
fully validated for locus specificity and the possible presence of repetitive elements [29,30]. The possible effect of
such a drawback remains to be verified for most crop and
tree species which genomes are essentially not sequenced.
Based on EST sequence data available for white spruce
[40], we have designed primers and resequenced genomic
DNA for hundreds of genes in white spruce and black
spruce. The high quality SNP datasets developed were
used to select SNPs amenable to the GoldenGate genotyping assay and test the technology for these two species.
Then, we integrated these SNP data into linkage maps of
expressed genes and illustrated the possibility to rapidly
improve the density of existing genetic maps for spruce
species.

Methods
Plant material for genotyping assays and linkage mapping
Plant material consisted of one outbred F1 cross #
C9612856 (Ǩ80112 × ǩ80109) for white spruce (Picea
glauca [Moench] Voss) with 292 progeny derived from
two parents selected for their high level of heterozygosity
for ESTP anchor markers and for their intermediate performance for a number of traits such as somatic embryogenic capacity [41]. Plant material for black spruce (Picea
mariana [Mill.] B.S.P.) was representative of the hybridizing species complex Picea mariana × Picea rubens (hereafter
designated as black spruce) and consisted of 283 progeny
derived from the backcross-like cross BC1 (#9920002:
Ǩ11307-03 [Ǩ83 × ǩ425] × ǩ425), as previously
described [42]. Spruces all harbor 2n = 2x = 24 chromosomes, as for most Pinaceae [43,44]. The lineages leading
to these two taxa are thought to have diverged at least 10
Myr ago [45].
Gene selection and PCR amplification
For SNP discovery, we considered a collection of 16,500
unigenes derived from a white spruce EST database [40].
For each gene, coding regions were identified based on
alignments with similar sequences from uniprot-swissprot protein databases. PCR primers for amplification and
resequencing were designed using Primer3 [46]. Whenever possible, one of the primers was anchored outside of
the coding regions in order to increase amplification spe-

cificity. The same primers were also used for SNP discovery in black spruce. The lists of unigene and primer
sequences for the genes represented on the two Illumina
SNP bead arrays for white spruce and black spruce are provided [see Additional file 1].
For each of white spruce and black spruce, DNA was isolated from the two parents of the mapping population
and their progeny, as well as from haploid megagametophyte tissue using a DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, Ontario). About 5–20 ng of template DNA were
used for PCR amplification. Reactions were done in 30 µl
containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mM KCl, 1.5–
2.5 mM MgCl2, 250 µM of each dNTP, 400 µM of both 5'
and 3' primers and 1.0 unit of Platinum Taq DNA
Polymerase (Invitrogen). Peltier Thermal Cycler (DNA
Engine, DYAD™, MJResearch) was used with a initial
denaturation of 4 minutes at 94°, followed by 35 cycles of
30 seconds at 94°, 30 seconds at annealing temperature
optimized between 55 and 60° for each pair of primers,
and 3 minutes at 72°, completed with an additional 10
minutes at 72°.
Each PCR fragment was sequenced with the amplification
primers using BigDye Terminator v3.0 cycle sequencing
ready reaction kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California) and an automated ABI Prism® 3700 Genetic
Sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Sequences were analysed and assembled with Seqmerge (Genetics Computer
Group, Wisconsin Package Version 10.3, Accelrys, San
Diego, California).
SNP discovery
SNPs were detected for each of the two parents for each
species from heterozygous positions indicated by doublepeak signatures in sequence chromatograms. For each
SNP detected, haploid DNA sequences from individual
megagametophyte tissue were used as a control for paralogy. Because of their haploid nature, any double peak signature in the sequence chromatogram from a
megagametophyte would indicate a SNP resulting from
polymorphism between gene loci, hence paralogous variation. Because these SNPs would result in fixed polymorphisms in the progeny, they were not considered for
genotyping and mapping.
SNP selection for bead array construction
Gene regions were amplified by PCR and resequenced in
order to identify in excess of 1,000 candidate SNPs for
each of white spruce and black spruce. Out of them, 1,534
SNPs were used to construct two species-specific Illumina
bead arrays of 768 SNPs using the GoldenGate assay (Illumina Inc., San Diego, California). For each species, when
more than one SNP was available for a gene, SNPs were
chosen so each SNP was specific to one parental genotype.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/21

This scheme allowed to validate the SNP mapping
approach, as SNPs of a same gene are expected to map at
the same position on composite maps. In optimizing the
choice of SNPs for a given gene in a given species, those
with maximum GoldenGate assay functionality score
were chosen. The functionality score is an a priori measure
of SNP adequation to the GoldenGate assay and takes into
account a number of parameters, including sequence conformation around the SNP, lack of repetitive elements in
the surrounding sequence (200 bp upstream and downstream) and sequence redundancy against the available
sequence database of the recipient species [29]. For white
spruce, a small subset of 38 SNPs representative of 31
genes was drawn from in silico identification of SNPs in
contigs resulting from the assembly of EST sequences [18].
All chosen in silico SNPs involved EST sequences from at
least two different cDNA clones and had a probability of
occurrence of 0.95 or more, according to the statistical
assessment conducted with a bayesian method [18].
SNP genotyping assay
The Illumina bead array technology was used to carry out
all genotyping reactions in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol for the SNP GoldenGate assay [29].
Highly multiplexed allele-specific extension reactions
were conducted with two allele-specific primers per SNP
for each of the two species-specific 768-SNP arrays using
250 ng of template DNA per sample (at a rate of 50 ng/µl)
for each progeny in each species and for positive controls
consisting of five replicates of each parent of the mapping
populations also used to identify SNPs from resequencing. Negative controls were also added to each 96-well
sample plate. Ligation was completed with a third locusspecific primer. This step was followed by PCR amplification on the extension-ligation product using primers
labeled with either Cy3 or Cy5 dye to distinguish between
alleles at each SNP. Products of the PCR reaction were
hybridized onto a decoded Sentrix Array Matrix (SAM)
(Illumina Inc., San Diego). Bundles of the SAM include
beadtypes coated with oligonucleotides complementary
to a primer address on the PCR product. Each beadtype is
represented with an average redundancy of 30X on the
array to optimize the accuracy of the final genotype signal.
Following hybridization, the signal in each wavelength
was determined using a bead array reader that converts
images to intensity data. The intensity data for each SNP
was normalized and assigned a cluster position (and
resulting genotype) with the BeadStudio software (Illumina Inc.), and a quality score for each genotype was generated. A GenCall score cutoff of 0.25 was used to
determine valid genotypes at each SNP and the SNPs
retained had to get a minimum GenTrain score of 0.25
[47,30]. Gentrain scores measure the reliability of SNP
detection based on the distribution of genotypic classes
[30]. DNA reports, locus summaries, and final reports

were generated for downstream analysis using the BeadStudio software (Illumina Inc.).
Estimation of linkage maps
AFLP, RAPD, SSR, and ESTP marker data previously used
for linkage mapping in the two species [20,41,42] were
considered together with the new SNP data for constructing linkage maps. For each cross, locus segregation was
tested for goodness-of-fit to expected Mendelian segregation ratios using chi-square tests (P ≤ 0.01 with Bonferonni correction). Distorted loci were excluded from
further analyses. Linkage analyses were conducted with
the male and female datasets independently to obtain two
individual linkage maps for each species. Each SNP was
considered as an independent marker. Then, a composite
linkage map was assembled from the two parental maps
for each species, where SNPs from the same gene were
considered simultaneously as a single haplotype. Individual and composite linkage maps were estimated using
procedures described by Pelgas et al. [42]. Both crosses
were analysed using the "two-way pseudo-testcross" mapping approach [48]. All linkage analyses and map estimations were performed with JoinMap 3.0 [49,50]. In
addition, markers were ordered with the Monte Carlo
maximum likelihood mapping algorithm implemented
in JoinMap 4.0 and using standard parameters [51]. With
both versions of JoinMap, the parameter CP (cross-pollination) was used with a maximal threshold value of 5 for
the jump, a ripple value of 1, and Kosambi's mapping
function [52]. For marker grouping and linked loci ordering, a LOD score of 6.0 to 9.0 and a minimum recombination fraction (θ) of 0.30 were used. The expected
genome map length Ge was estimated under the assumption of random marker distribution according to the formula of [53]. An estimate of genome map coverage Ce was
obtained according to the formula of [54] for the same
LOD value (4.0, used for individual linkage maps) as for
previous coverage estimates [41,42].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/21

Distribution of markers on linkage groups
For each species, randomness of gene locus distribution
within and among linkage groups, heterogeneity of
marker distribution (G-tests) among linkage groups, and
marker dispersion were analysed from the composite map
as previously described [46]. Analyses were conducted by
considering 1) all marker types and 2) only gene markers
(SNPs and ESTPs). For AFLP markers only, previously
published analyses of randomness of distribution showed
no aggregated pattern of distribution [46,41]. As no additional AFLP markers were added in the present study, no
distribution test was conducted with this type of marker
alone.
Validation of marker orthology between species
The homoeology of linkage groups between white spruce
and black spruce was determined according to the same
criterion as described by Pelgas et al. [41]. The recognition
of orthologous from paralogous loci was also carried out
according to Pelgas et al. [41]. To validate exceptions to
linkage group synteny, resequencing from haploid megagametophyte tissue was performed for presumed orthologous markers positioned on non-homoeologous linkage
groups. Any sequence polymorphism detected in the
chromatogram of the haploid DNA sequence was considered as evidence for paralogy. Changes in synteny were
validated on a second mapping population available for
each species whenever necessary.

Results
Construction of SNP-arrays
A total of 487 expressed sequences were amplified and
resequenced in white spruce parents, of which 394 were
found with at least one orthologous SNP (Table 1). Primers designed for amplification and resequencing of
expressed genes in white spruce could be transferred to
black spruce at a rate of 90.1%, which is in line with
results obtained previously for a more limited set of genes
[55]. The transfer procedure resulted in the amplification
and sequencing of 462 genes in black spruce parents, of
which 355 contained at least one orthologous SNP (Table

1). For the 279 genes simultaneously amplified, resequenced, and found with at least one SNP in each of white
spruce and black spruce, only 4.7% of the observed SNPs
were shared between the two species (Table 1). This fraction is based on gene resequencing from two parents in
each species. Accordingly, two Illumina bead arrays of 768
SNPs for the GoldenGate assay were constructed, one for
each species. The array built for white spruce contained
SNPs representative of 425 genes and that for black spruce
contained SNPs for 348 genes. The Additional file 1
(Table S1) provides primer sequences used for PCR amplification, unigene identifiers, and links with the ForestTreeDB database hosting the unigene sequences and their
annotations [56]. A total of 273 genes were represented
simultaneously on both arrays [Additional file 1]. All in
all, the white spruce SNP-array resulted in 232,000 SNP
calls and the black spruce SNP-array in 225,000 SNP calls.
Reproducibility of the SNP assay and effect of template
concentration
The reproducibility of the assay was evaluated using five
replicates for each of the mapping parents also used to
identify SNPs from resequencing. When estimated over all
valid SNPs (thus excluding failed SNPs, see below), on
average, 99.4% of the SNP calls were concordant with
expectations when using the recommended amount of
DNA template (50 ng/µl in 5 µl). The rate of concordant
SNP calls was lower when testing with less template DNA
(97.8% for 17 ng/µl, 94.3% for 10 ng/µl, and 81.2% for 4
ng/µl, all assays in 5 µl sample volume).
Overall success rate of the SNP bead arrays
GenTrain scores correspond to the reliability of SNP
detection based on the distribution of genotypic classes.

Thus, it is a measure of reliability based on the total array
of calls for a given SNP. According to Illumina, for a SNP
to be retained, a minimum GenTrain score of 0.25 is
advisable [30,47,57]. In the present study, a SNP had to
get a minimum GenTrain score of 0.25 and had to be segregating in the related mapping population to be declared
successful. In white spruce, 81.6% of SNPs identified by
resequencing had GenTrain score of 0.25 or more (Table
2), which is in the range of that obtained for human SNPs
identified from resequencing for polymorphism discovery
[29]. In black spruce, the corresponding percentage was
82.0%. Contrary to expectations, a number of these SNPs
were monomorphic in the mapping populations (Table
2). It is likely that one of the two allele-specific primers in
the GoldenGate assay defaulted for these SNPs. When discarding these monomorphic SNPs, the overall rate of success for the genotyping of resequenced SNPs was 69.2% in
white spruce and 77.1% in black spruce (Table 2). The
genotyping success rate on the basis of the number of
genes assayed was higher (respectively 77.6% and 89.4%
for each of white spruce and black spruce, Table 2)
because of redundancy of SNP sampling for some genes.
For white spruce, a number of in silico SNPs identified
from redundancy in EST contigs [18] were also included
on the SNP array, and 81.6% of them had GenTrain score
of 0.25 or more (Table 2), which is comparable to the percentage obtained for resequenced SNPs. The overall success rate taking into account segregation in the mapping
population was lower at 28.9%, because monomorphism
for in silico SNPs was much more frequent than that for
resequenced SNPs. Individuals previously used for EST
sequencing and in silico identification of SNPs did not
include the parents of the present white spruce mapping

population. Hence, it is likely that white spruce parents
were homozygous for many of these in silico SNPs, which
resulted in a much higher rate of monomorphism than for
resequenced SNPs. Indeed, when scoring these in silico
SNPs for individuals from natural populations, many of
these SNPs exhibited the expected polymorphism and the
overall success rate obtained was 60% (data not shown).
Rate of missing data according to SNP GenTrain scores
A missing data is generated when the GenCall score for a
particular individual and SNP is below 0.25 [30]. GenCall
is a measure of the reliability of an individual SNP call relative to the distribution of genotypic classes for that SNP.
The call rate, which is 1 minus the rate of missing data,
could be estimated for all SNPs with acceptable GenTrain
scores. In agreement with data on human SNPs [30], our
results indicated that SNPs with GenTrain scores of 0.25
or more were highly reliable with a low rate of missing
data (Table 3). The average call rate per valid SNP with
GenTrain score of 0.25 or more was 99.4% for white
spruce and 99.6% for black spruce. For SNPs with GenTrain scores higher than 0.4, the rate of missing data
became infinitesimal and the average rate of missing data
per successful SNP was very low, with an average of 0.61%
for white spruce and 0.40% for black spruce (Table 3),
thus less than 1%.

SNP success rate according to a priori SNP functionality
score
Before construction of the SNP bead array, a functionality
score was calculated for each candidate SNP using the Illumina OligoDesigner software [29]. The functionality
score relies much on the uniqueness and lack of repetitive
elements in the surrounding sequence of each SNP [29].
The higher the score, the more likely the SNP will be functional at the genotyping stage under the GoldenGate
assay. SNPs with a predicted functionality score above
0.60 had a much higher rate of success than those below
0.60 (χ2 = 51.0 with the white spruce SNP data and χ2 =
34.9 with the black spruce SNP data, d.f. = 1, P ≤ 0.01)
(Table 4). Thus, in spite of the incompleteness of the
spruce genome sequence used to estimate the appropriateness of candidate SNPs for the GoldenGate assay, the
functionality score was still a valuable predictor of the
likelihood of success of the designed oligonucleotides.
Indeed, most of the SNPs selected for arraying had functionality scores equal or higher than 0.60 (Table 4).
Individual and composite linkage maps for white spruce
and black spruce
Depending on the cross and parent analysed, between
518 and 586 genetic markers were available to estimate
each individual linkage map (Table 5). Of these, between

failed and monomorphic SNPs.

86.3% and 91% could be mapped. They were distributed
over 12 major linkage groups, except for parent 80109, for
which one additional minor linkage group derived exclusively from AFLPs was obtained.
For each cross, male and female datasets were integrated
into one composite linkage map representative of each
species. For white spruce, 821 markers (461 AFLPs, 12
SSRs, 348 gene markers including 31 ESTPs and 317
SNPs) could be mapped over the 2,304.2 cM, including
nine accessory marker loci (Table 5, Figures 1, 2, 3, 4). On
this map, the average marker spacing was 2.8 cM. For
black spruce, a total of 835 markers (469 AFLPs, 2 RAPDs,
36 SSRs, 328 gene markers including 30 ESTPs and 298
SNPs) could be mapped over the 1,849.8 cM, including
22 accessory marker loci (Table 5, Figures 1, 2, 3, 4). The
average marker spacing was 2.2 cM.
Marker distribution
To analyse the distribution of marker loci, G-tests for
goodness-of-fit were used. For each composite linkage
map, markers were homogeneously distributed across
linkage groups (data not shown). Therefore, coefficients
of dispersion could be estimated for each composite map
see [42]. Whether we considered all markers or gene loci
only (SNPs and ESTPs), the coefficients of dispersion calculated with a sliding window of 3 cM ranged between 0.9
and 1.1 for the white spruce composite map and between
1.1 and 1.3 for the black spruce composite map. Such values around 1.0 indicates the absence of significant marker
islands and a random distribution of gene loci at the
present mapping intensity.

Interspecific comparisons
The composite linkage maps of white spruce and black
spruce shared 215 homologous anchor markers (9 SSRs,
13 ESTPs, and 193 SNPs). Over the 12 homoeologous
linkage groups, 98.1% of homologous markers were in
synteny (Figures 1, 2, 3, 4). One ESTP locus (Ptxmyb413 =
90004/MYB4) and three gene SNPs (2309, 3656, and
6047) were involved in synteny discrepancies. The differential positioning of the ESTP locus was already pointed
out and validated by sequencing [41]. The examination of
chromatograms obtained from sequencing haploid megagametophyte DNA around the two SNP markers 6047
and 3656 respectively positioned onto LGs II/VII and LGs
XII/III of white spruce/black spruce revealed polymorphisms. Such evidence indicates that these two anchor
markers differentially positioned in white spruce and
black spruce correspond to two paralogous gene loci.
Another discrepancy involved SNP 2309 positioned onto
white spruce LG V and on black spruce LG VI. However,
linkage mapping analyses independently conducted in a
second white spruce mapping population (data not
shown) led to localize this gene marker on LG VI in both
species. Therefore, exceptions to synteny were rejected
regarding the differential positioning of these three SNP
gene loci between the two species. Along with synteny,
macrocolinearity was also well conserved among homoeologous linkage groups between the two spruce taxa. On
average, 82% of syntenic anchor markers were positioned
in the same order (Figures 1, 2, 3, 4). Minor inversions
involving closely spaced markers were observed within
each homoeologous linkage group, involving a total of 1
SSR, 6 ESTPs and 31 SNPs. These inversions were also
detected when comparing individual linkage maps within

Discussion
Applicability of the GoldenGate SNP assay
The Illumina GoldenGate SNP assay, together with the
bead array technology, has been extensively used in studies of human polymorphisms [13]. Its use has also been
extended to animal genetics, especially with regard to
efforts undertaken by the Bovine HapMap consortium
[58]. Because of its well-established reliability with
human data and high level of multiplexing, there is a
growing interest in using the GoldenGate SNP assay in
plants when large numbers of SNPs need to be surveyed.
Indeed, the flexibility of its design and the large number

of SNPs screened per assay make the technology appropriate for genome scan applications or plant molecular
breeding purposes. However, with the exception of
reports from biotech companies, very few studies with
detailed supportive evidence have been published on the
ease of implementing the technology in plants and non
model organisms with largely unsequenced genomes. We
have considered this issue in spruce by examining the genotyping success rates obtained over a set of high quality
SNPs derived from independent resequencing.
Call rate
The call rate is the fraction of genotypes called over the
possible SNP calls after having excluded unsuccessful
assays [30]. In our data, the SNPs retained for genetic
mapping analysis had call rates greater than 96%. Their

Comparison of homoeologous linkage groups (LGs) of composite maps for white spruce (on the left) and black
spruce (species complex Picea mariana × P. rubens) (on the right). For each taxon, the composite map was obtained by
assembly of two parental datasets and use of JoinMap 3.0 and 4.0. [49,50]. Genetic distances are indicated on the left of the figure (Kosambi). Markers in bold are gene SNPs, markers in bold and underlined are ESTPs, markers in bold and italics are SSRs,
markers in italic and underlined are RAPDs and all other markers are AFLPs. Markers with a grey background are common
between both taxa. Orthologous and paralogous markers are connected by a solid line and dashed line, respectively. Markers
not positioned onto homoeologous LGs are printed in white on a black background.

Comparison of homoeologous linkage groups (LGs) of composite maps for white spruce (on the left) and black
spruce (species complex Picea mariana × P. rubens) (on the right). For each taxon, the composite map was obtained by
assembly of two parental datasets and use of JoinMap 3.0 and 4.0. [49,50]. Genetic distances are indicated on the left of the figure (Kosambi). Markers in bold are gene SNPs, markers in bold and underlined are ESTPs, markers in bold and italics are SSRs,
markers in italic and underlined are RAPDs and all other markers are AFLPs. Markers with a grey background are common
between both taxa. Orthologous and paralogous markers are connected by a solid line and dashed line, respectively. Markers
not positioned onto homoeologous LGs are printed in white on a black background.

average call rate was in excess of 99%. This value is comparable to call rates obtained with human SNPs using the
GoldenGate assay, which are near 100% when following
the same stringent criterion of minimum GenTrain score
of 0.25 as that used in the present study for considering as
valid the genotyping of a SNP [29,30,59,60].
SNP conversion rate
The rate of SNPs successfully genotyped using the GoldenGate assay, or SNP conversion rate, is calculated by counting only valid SNPs displaying GenTrain score above a
given cutoff. The GenTrain score of a SNP reflects the
degree of separation between homozygote and heterozygote clusters and the ease of placement of individual calls
within a cluster, which are key measures of signal-to-noise
in the assay data [30]. As recommended by Illumina, we
followed a conservative approach and filtered out SNPs
with a GenTrain score below 0.25, which tend to show
low call rate and hence, high rates of missing data [30].
Based on this criterion alone and not considering monomorphic SNPs, the SNP conversion rates were 81.6% and
82.0% of the resequenced SNPs for the white spruce and
black spruce SNP arrays, respectively. These rates were
down to 69.2% and 77.1%, respectively, when excluding
monomorphic SNPs. High SNP conversion rates have
been obtained in studies conducted in species with completely sequenced genomes such as for the human
genome. Besides studies involving human SNPs, GenTrain score cutoffs have been barely mentioned in the literature although they affect the SNP conversion rates and
the average call rate. Thus, the following comparisons of
our results with the published literature may not be
orthogonal.

In a study encompassing 1,536 resequenced SNPs derived
from the human genome, 93.3% of SNPs were called after
removal of low frequency SNPs [61]. Two other sets each
encompassing 768 HapMap SNPs were successfully
assayed with 91.0% and 93.9% conversion rates [62]. The
application of the GoldenGate SNP assay in non model
species resulted in slightly lower SNP conversion rates
than that obtained for human SNPs. The conversion rate
was 91.3% over 1,524 resequenced SNPs in barley [32]
and 88.9% over a panel of 450 bovine SNPs [63]. In
Boechera stricta, a species from the Cruciferae family, a
conversion rate of 96.8% was obtained over 96 resequenced SNPs by avoiding highly similar sequences such
as for members of complex gene families [64]. For candidate genes that were members of large gene families, the
authors searched for markers in flanking genes that were
single copy in Arabidopsis [64]. Under these circumstances,
the design of Illumina probes was efficient and specific.
However, such an approach is limited to plant species
close to Arabidopsis, which genome is completely
sequenced.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/21

Two main factors may explain the lower SNP conversion
rate obtained with spruces as compared to other species
analysed to date with the GoldenGate SNP assay. First, we
have adopted the severe criterion of GenTrain scores <
0.25 to reject SNPs, while this factor remains unknown for
most of the non human studies submentioned. In the
present study, such a conservative criterion translated in
SNPs with a high call rate, which was necessary for accurate gene mapping. Second, the complexity of conifer
genomes e.g. [37] may obstruct the development of specific probes for the assay. Indeed, our SNP assays incorporated mostly sequences belonging to multigene families
including many transcription factors [see Additional file
1]. With the present incomplete knowledge of conifer
genomes, it was not possible to take into account gene
family structures to improve the oligonucleotide design
for the GoldenGate SNP assay. The level of duplication
has not been quantified yet in conifer genomes contrary to
angiosperm model species such as legumes or grasses.
However, phylogenetic analysis of multigene families in
conifers has revealed an organization different from that
observed in angiosperms. Examples include the adh genes
[65], knox-I [66] and myb [67] regulatory genes, with many
gene duplications at least recent enough not to be shared
with angiosperms. Paralogous SNPs generate a background signal giving rise to cluster compression and therefore, decreasing GenTrain scores and the SNP conversion
rate, unless manual editing of the clusters is used to eliminate all SNPs that do no cluster well [29]. If the conifer
genome is highly duplicated, as suspected, interpreting
GoldenGate SNP data in the context of maximizing the
conversion rate could be very challenging and imply
much lower call rates per SNP recovered. Without an
exhaustive knowledge of gene sequences within a gene
family, there is no easy way to avoid such SNPs with
potential lack of specificity of flanking sequences. This
trend is even more likely, given that all SNPs tested herein
were in gene sequences. Indeed, the probability for these
SNPs to represent paralogous variation across family
members is likely higher than that for SNPs located in non
coding DNA.
For SNPs exhibiting monomorphism (about 8% of resequenced SNPs in white spruce and 4% in black spruce), it
is likely that one of the two allele-specific primers in the
GoldenGate assay defaulted for these SNPs, given that
resequencing was performed to discover SNPs and that we
are confident that they were not sequencing artifacts.
These failures might be related to the same factors as
above. Thus, considering the fragmentary knowledge we
have of conifer genomes and the emphasis put on sampling SNPs from regulatory genes from large gene families, the overall success rate obtained was decent. The
success rate was also repeatable between the two speciesspecific SNP-arrays that we have independently tested. As

the genome of conifers is becoming better known at the
sequence level, due to several large-scale EST and BAC
sequencing projects, the rates of genotyping success for
new SNPs are expected to be even higher in the near
future.
Transcript linkage maps
With around 10,000 to 40,000 Mb [39], spruce and conifer genomes are more than 100 times larger than that of
Arabidopsis and three times larger than the human
genome. For the largely unsequenced conifer genomes,
sequencing their coding regions through EST sequencing
and gene resequencing currently represents the most efficient approach to comparative and structural genomics
using gene linkage maps [19]. The SNP genotyping assays
developed in this study enabled to map hundreds of
expressed genes in the conifer Picea, which represent a
large increase over any previous gene mapping effort in
gymnosperms e.g. [19,42,41,68-71].

A total of 12 major linkage groups were delineated in each
species composite map, which is in agreement with
cytogenetic studies indicating similar karyotypes and
same numbers of chromosomes (2n = 2x = 24) for both
white spruce and black spruce and most other Pinaceae
[44]. Because of the agreement between number of linkage groups and number of chromosomes, the present
maps could be considered as saturated [Liu 1998]. High
genome coverage values also point to this observation.
However, a direct pairing between linkage groups and
chromosomes was not possible, as Picea and most conifer
chromosomes are difficult to differentiate based on standard cytological techniques [44]. With the addition of several hundreds new gene markers, the observed total length
of individual parental maps was increased by 15% to
25%, and the genome coverage values were increased by
nearly 10% compared to previous maps mostly based on
anonymous markers [41,42]. With more than 300 gene
anchor markers positioned on each parental map, marker
density was more than 50% higher and gene density was
an order of magnitude higher than previously obtained
[41,42]. As compared to AFLP and other types of dominant markers, these codominant SNP gene markers
mapped at such high density will contribute towards
improving QTL mapping precision and power [72].
More than 200 gene loci were shared between the two
composite maps developed herein, most of which being
derived from the new gene SNP developing effort. While
previous efforts to increase the number of gene or SSR
anchor markers relied on using several crosses per species
e.g. [41,42,73,74], the ease of mapping large numbers of
transcripts using SNPs relaxes the need to implicate more
than one cross for increasing the number of mapped
anchor markers. However, using an additional cross may

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/21

be highly useful to validate orthology of gene loci between
species when breaks of synteny are observed (see below).
Interspecific comparisons
Comparisons between the composite maps of white
spruce and black spruce revealed high synteny and colinearity between their 12 homoeologous linkage groups, in
spite of the divergence of their lineages more than 10 Myr
ago [45]. While previous reports of genome comparisons
between the two species reached similar conclusions
about synteny and colinearity [41], the present observations are based on a more than four-fold increase in the
number of mapped anchor loci in common between the
two species.

Synteny between genomic regions can only be established
if markers are true orthologs [41,42,75]. The breakdown
in synteny previously noted between white spruce and
black spruce for LG III and LG IV [41] was confirmed in
the present study. In addition, three new cases of putative
inter-chromosomal translocations between both species
were observed, but turned out to be false positives, after
checks for locus orthology using haploid megagametophyte DNA sequences or validating gene marker positions
in a second cross of white spruce. Thus, these three gene
SNPs corresponded to paralogous loci between white
spruce and black spruce. Such false positives are likely to
be frequent in conifer mapping studies, as previously
observed [41].
While synteny was well conserved, exceptions to colinearity between the two genomes were observed. Small inversions between the two species composite maps involving
a few closely spaced anchor loci were noted for all linkage
groups, but no translocation within linkage groups was
observed. Most likely, these inversions resulted from analytical artifacts since the same discrepancies were observed
between individual linkage maps within species. Thus, it
is safe to assume that these inversions resulted from the
integration of both parental datasets for each species
rather than from true chromosomal inversions. Such a
trend has also been observed when integrating individual
linkage maps in other species [5,6,42,73,76].

Conclusion
The present report illustrates how new highly multiplexed
SNP genotyping approaches can be used to accelerate the
structural analyses of complex and largely unknown
genomes. The present maps are the most advanced genetic
maps for spruce with regard to gene density and will open
up several opportunities. These maps are currently used
for QTL and eQTL detection and their next more densified
versions will help target specific regions of the genome for
future BAC sequencing [19]. The present maps will also be
used to explore in more detail the distribution of multi-

gene families over linkage groups and hence, the organization of the spruce genome and its evolution. Such an
approach, though at a small scale, has been previously
used for the knox I multigene family, underlining a major
chromosomal duplication in the spruce genome [66].
Maps with increasing gene densities are also required
across the conifers to extend comparative genome studies
and decipher the evolution of genome structure. Such
comparisons have already been undertaken based on a
limited number of anchor markers e.g. [19,41]. However,
comparative genome studies in these species remain challenging since SNPs may have to be identified de novo in
each species. This trend is best exemplified by the small
number of gene SNPs shared between mapping populations belonging to different congeneric taxa: only 45 SNPs
were shared between white spruce and black spruce mapping populations out of 2,000 candidate gene SNPs discovered in both species. Using more crosses per species
could contribute towards increasing the number of shared
SNPs between species, but it is unlikely to change the
order of magnitude of this number. On a more optimistic
note, the primer transfer rate between white spruce and
black spruce was high, which might facilitate resequencing efforts towards gene SNP discovery in other spruce
species. However, as species from different conifer genera
are targeted, the primer transfer rate is expected to diminish [55,19].

Identifying sets of homologous transcripts in other
Pinaceae has improved in the recent years through efficient mining of sequence databases e.g. [66,67] and
because of large sets of EST sequences for several species
[22-25,40]. Nevertheless, when changes in chromosomal
structure are observed between species based on gene
linkage maps, gene orthology must be verified. Distinguishing between orthology and paralogy can be precarious when the assessment is only based on homology
scores, and without an adequate phylogenetic landscape
for each gene family involved [77]. In such conditions, a
sensitive analysis at the sequence level is warranted before
declaring such structural changes [41,42]. Thus, comparative mapping studies between conifer species call for further developments of gene maps and gene sequence
collections, but also for genomics and bioinformatics
tools enabling to assess more efficiently orthology relationships.
