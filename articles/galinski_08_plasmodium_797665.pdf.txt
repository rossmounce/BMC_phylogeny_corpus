Abstract
More attention is being focused on malaria today than any time since the world's last efforts to
achieve eradication over 40 years ago. The global community is now discussing strategies aimed at
dramatically reducing malarial disease burden and the eventual eradication of all types of malaria,
everywhere. As a consequence, Plasmodium vivax, which has long been neglected and mistakenly
considered inconsequential, is now entering into the strategic debates taking place on malaria
epidemiology and control, drug resistance, pathogenesis and vaccines. Thus, contrary to the past,
the malaria research community is becoming more aware and concerned about the widespread
spectrum of illness and death caused by up to a couple of hundred million cases of vivax malaria
each year. This review brings these issues to light and provides an overview of P. vivax vaccine
development, then and now. Progress had been slow, given inherent research challenges and
minimal support in the past, but prospects are looking better for making headway in the next few
years. P. vivax, known to invade the youngest red blood cells, the reticulocytes, presents a strong
challenge towards developing a reliable long-term culture system to facilitate needed research. The
P. vivax genome was published recently, and vivax researchers now need to coordinate efforts to
discover new vaccine candidates, establish new vaccine approaches, capitalize on non-human
primate models for testing, and investigate the unique biological features of P. vivax, including the
elusive P. vivax hypnozoites. Comparative studies on both P. falciparum and P. vivax in many areas of
research will be essential to eradicate malaria. And to this end, the education and training of future
generations of dedicated "malariologists" to advance our knowledge, understanding and the
development of new interventions against each of the malaria species infecting humans also will be
essential.

Background
Malaria vaccine research and development efforts, since
the early 1980s, have almost exclusively been focused on
Plasmodium falciparum, the most prevalent and most
deadly of the human malaria parasite species [1]. When
first approached to write this review with a focus on Plasmodium vivax vaccines, a somewhat whimsical thought

was: Who cares? A relatively small group of scientists
involved in research on P. vivax for over 20 years have
been repeatedly faced with the challenge of making arguments to funding bodies to support research on what has
been viewed, most certainly inappropriately, as a
"benign" parasite. The world is now recognizing that the
'benign' designation has been an unfortunate misnomer

used widely in the literature [2,3] and it is satisfying to
finally witness a credible shift in concern and a surge of
attention on P. vivax.
So, who does care and what has caused this shift? First of
all, certainly the people who live in places across the globe
with the day-to-day threat of being infected with this parasite care passionately. Patient's anecdotes repeatedly
indicate that being sick with vivax malaria is terrible and
makes one 'feel like they are going to die'. Vivax malaria even
today ranges from temperate through the subtropical and
tropical zones of the world exhibiting an array of adaptations that enable this parasite to exist in widely varying
ecological and climatic conditions [4,5]. Since estimates
for the number of vivax malaria cases have ranged from a
minimum of 35,000,000 to 80,000,000, or perhaps a couple of hundred million more, the morbidity from this disease cannot be considered inconsequential, despite its
moniker of 'benign tertian malaria' [3,6-8]. Given a propensity towards significant and severe anaemia, thrombocytopaenia, violent paroxysms and fevers of 40°C to
41.6°C that, if untreated, can last for weeks, uncomplicated vivax malaria is a disease with serious morbidity [7].
Furthermore, the recent publication of several well-documented studies have highlighted and validated older
anecdotal evidence that P. vivax infections, much like P.
falciparum, can frequently cause severe and complicated
clinical disease syndromes, that may result in death [913]. These elements alone argue for greater consideration
of the inclusion of vivax malaria in research portfolios,
provision of targeted research support that will facilitate
the study of this human malaria, and in planning of vivax
malaria control efforts by policy makers and funding bodies.

side continued work on P. falciparum, and eventually also
include, the least prevalent human malaria species, Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium ovale [15]. As noted
above, the global widespread predominance of P. vivax
infections outside of Africa and this parasite's special
adaptive features, such as the presence and activation of
dormant liver-stage forms called hypnozoites (more on
this topic below) makes it a fierce and tenacious enemy,
with debilitating health and socioeconomic ramifications
for families, communities and nations. Thus, the proclamation to eradicate malaria is great news for the tens of
millions, or, by the higher estimates, several hundred million, people who become infected each year and suffer
dearly with P. vivax infections.

A second simple truth regarding the cause for the shift in
who cares about vivax malaria came about when in October, 2007, Bill and Melinda Gates called together a prestigious group of malariologists, malaria R & D funding
bodies and various international or, to use the newer buzz
term, global health personages. Speaking before this
group they articulated their goal, a global goal, to not just
control malaria, but to eradicate malaria. This was an
audacious challenge posed to the international community, but ever since the stars have been lining up to reassess and push research directions forward with this goal in
mind at an expedited pace [14].

Over the past few decades, for all aspects of vivax malaria
research, there have been a restricted number of people
studying this parasite and disease, and thus very few people have been honing expertise on P. vivax. However, in
the past few years, the number of researchers working to
improve knowledge on the biology, epidemiology, clinical features, and treatment of P. vivax has been increasing,
or perhaps just becoming increasingly visible and outspoken. Thanks to the Multilateral Initiative on Malaria, and
other supporters, two international conferences were
organized in 2002 and 2005 with an exclusive focus on P.
vivax. Other recent meetings of MALVAC, a malaria vaccine advisory committee of WHO/IVR, focused on P. vivax
vaccine development in 2005 (Cali, Colombia) and in
2007 (Barcelona, Spain). In addition, there has been
some excitement and anticipation building over the last
few years with the development and completion of the P.
vivax genome sequencing project [16]. The recent meetings and political efforts revolving around the genome
project have aimed to demonstrate the need for increased
emphasis on this parasite species, with a contingent of
researchers eager to assist, and, importantly, to chart the
way for post-genomic discovery and research directions.
Today, the outlook and capabilities for research on P.
vivax and envisioning vivax-specific preventive and curative tools are promising, but much more needs to be done.
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), its partners such as the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI),
and other traditional funding bodies (e.g. government
agencies) can be confident in seeing strong progress from
their investments in this research, especially if necessary
strategic support mechanisms are provided.

The especially good news, if this is to be achieved this
time, is that malaria eradication means eliminating 'all'
types of malaria, everywhere. Earlier eradication efforts
were far from global, basically by-passing Africa, as well as
various countries and regions around the world. Therefore, this manifesto was ground-shaking and meant that
attention must start to realistically focus on P. vivax along-

So, what's next? As has been realized with the new call for
eradication of malaria, new methods and strategies of
intervention are required to block transmission and
reduce carriers of vivax malaria. This will come through
the results of focused research on the shared, unique, and
unknown biological, clinical and epidemiological features of P. vivax. These special features of vivax malaria and

the research needed to bring about new interventions
have been discussed recently [2,3,16,17]. One of these
interventions is, of course, a vaccine, or perhaps more correctly put, vaccines against P. vivax [17]. This review aims
to bring heightened attention on this topic, critically
assessing what P. vivax vaccine candidates have been in
the pipeline, and what is required to rebuild this pipeline
and successfully advance new candidates for preclinical
and clinical trials.

Protein -1 (MSP-1) was discovered as a major merozoite
surface antigen in Plasmodium yoelii and P. falciparum
[31,32], the orthologous gene for the P. vivax antigen was
characterized [33]. Research led to the identification of
the C-terminal end of PfMSP-1 as the target of inhibitory
antigens [32], and the equivalent PvMSP-1-p19 and p42
portions were subsequently produced and examined as
vivax vaccine candidates ([34], Barnwell, Longacre &
David, unpublished data).

P. vivax – status of clinical vaccine trials today
Where does P. vivax vaccine progress stand amongst the
myriad of development activities being undertaken
towards vaccines to protect against P. falciparum? Well,
historically, since the mid-1980s there has been very little
specific focus on P. vivax vaccine development, and this
fact is reflected in the malaria vaccine 'rainbow tables',
with only a few vivax vaccine candidates listed among 56
preclinical programmes and 20 clinical studies [18]. Very
few laboratories (they can be counted on one hand, two
at most) have worked to identify and pre-clinically characterize P. vivax vaccine candidates, and only a couple of
P. vivax antigens are imminently poised to advance into
clinical trials. One is an asexual blood-stage antigen, the
merozoite invasion ligand protein known as the Duffy
Binding Protein (DBP), whose binding domain (RII) has
gone through preclinical testing in rodents and nonhuman primates [19-24]. The pre-erythrocytic/sporozoite
antigen, the Circumsporozoite Protein (CSP), also has
under gone preclinical studies in mice and primates, testing various platforms and formulations to advance into
clinical trials [25-28]. One other P. vivax candidate vaccine, a transmission blocking sexual stage antigen, Pvs25,
has been in phase I clinical trials [29,30].

Other asexual blood-stage antigens of P. vivax that have
worked their way through to some point of pre-clinical
testing include, MSP-3 family members [35,36] and the
Apical Membrane Antigen-1 (AMA-1) [37,38]. While they
have been 'hopeful' candidates, like MSP-1 at some point
in time, and still are in the view of many, these vivax
malaria target antigens are currently not being pursued
with vigor towards scheduled clinical trials. This is in part
due to the fact that these antigens are direct counterparts
of the presently most popular blood-stage vaccine candidates for P. falciparum, which are all presently in a series of
clinical trials in areas endemic for P. falciparum and awaiting definitive outcomes. If successful for P. falciparum,
then it might be expected to see these P. vivax antigens
also advance into clinical trials. However, that prospect,
based on early results of the P. falciparum vaccines, is not
without some uncertainties at this time. Beyond the above
stalwarts of malaria vaccine development there are not
too many other serious candidates in the vivax vaccine
pipeline undergoing preclinical investigations; Thrombospondin Related Anonymous Protein (TRAP), Reticulocyte Binding Proteins (RBPs), and MSP-9 are among the
few receiving some pre-clinical development effort [3942].

The vivax-specific vaccine development pipeline (or lack
of)
Below, the major vivax vaccine candidates and other antigens with vaccine potential are described and analysed
with considering the published data and the potential
hurdles that are unique to vivax malaria. Then, research
needs necessary to move P. vivax vaccine development forward and not in the shadow of P. falciparum vaccine development are proposed. It must be remembered that P.
falciparum and P. vivax are genetically distant malaria parasites and vaccination with comparable antigens for one
species predictably will likely not provide protection
against the other species or even necessarily provide the
same role in functional immunity.

Asexual P. vivax blood-stage vaccine candidates
Duffy Binding Protein
The interaction of the Duffy Binding Protein (DBP) at the
apical end of the merozoite with its red cell receptor, the
Duffy blood group antigen, also known as DARC (Duffy
Antigen Receptor for Chemokines), is essential for P. vivax
to invade human red blood cells [43,44]. The dbp gene is
a paralog of eba-175 and four other genes of P. falciparum
encoding ligands that are important for invasion by that
species, but in P. vivax there is a single gene within this
Duffy-Binding like (dbl) family [45-47]. This lack of alternative dbl gene family members in the P. vivax genome
and the almost universal dependence of vivax merozoites
on DARC for entry into RBCs [48,49] has made the DBP a
favourite, if not the favourite, candidate for a vivax bloodstage vaccine [43]. Since the identification of the dbp gene,
a conserved cysteine-rich binding domain (Region II) has
been mapped [20,50,51] and the function and structure
has been further evaluated using Plasmodium knowlesi.
Studies with transfected parasites lacking the pkdbpα gene,

In general, the thrust of efforts for vivax blood-stage vaccine discovery and development efforts, albeit limited in
scope, have mostly followed in the footsteps of what was
first being accomplished in the P. falciparum vaccine
developmental pathway. Thus, after the Merozoite Surface

the ortholog of pvdbp, show that the DBP is important for
junction formation between the merozoite and human
red blood cells [52]. The PkDBP X-ray crystallographic 3dimensional structure indicates the binding domain is
conserved structurally [53]. Immunological assays in conjunction with binding assays are mapping the important
polymorphic sites that may affect the functionality of antibodies raised by active immunization and natural infection [54-58]. Continued studies assessing PvDBP-RII
polymorphisms in different geographical locations and in
regards to functional immunity and the effects of polymorphism on protective efficacy will be warranted to continue to support its place as a leading P. vivax vaccine
candidate.
The Escherichia coli expressed and re-folded Region II
binding domain of the DBP [59,60] has gone through preclinical testing in rodents and non-human primates [2124]. In an immunogenicity study, the E. coli expressed and
re-folded PvDBP-RII candidate was used to immunize
Macaca mulatta, rhesus monkeys, which showed strong
and sustained antibody responses when formulated with
Alum, AS02A or Montanide ISA 720 [23]. As the rhesus
monkey is a primate host that does not accept infection
with P. vivax, the objective in this case was adjuvant selection and not determining protective efficacy, although the
induced antibodies did show high-titered blocking of
PvDBP-RII binding with DARC by in vitro assay [23]. A
prior study reported the immunization and challenge of
small New World monkeys, Aotus griseimembra (owl monkeys), with PvDBP-RII formulated with the powerful Freund's Complete Adjuvant (FCA) [22]. These monkeys can
be infected with P. vivax and use the Duffy antigen as a
receptor for invasion [20], however, despite the hint of
protection shown (delay in patent infection and reduction
in cumulative parasitaemia), the results are not convincing with regards to overall protective efficiency. Because
the P. vivax parasitaemia in both control and vaccine
groups in the challenged monkeys were all at low levels
and fairly erratic in this host, likely are due to the use of a
line of the Salvador I strain of P. vivax that is not completely adapted to a spleen-intact host, it is difficult to
accurately assess the biological effects of this vaccine in
this model of vivax malaria [22]. Besides, caution is also
warranted in the interpretation because FCA is known to
be an exceptionally powerful adjuvant, but it is unacceptable for human use due to necrotic lesions at the injection
sites and other complications; this adjuvant is also not
currently acceptable for use in monkeys for the same reasons. While this vaccine candidate formulated with FCA
nonetheless gave a hint of protection in this host, warranting further interest, it should be noted the Aotus monkeys
receiving PvDBP-RII formulated with Montanide ISA 720,
which has been used in humans, showed little or no protection [22].

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/7/S1/S9

The PvDBP-RII vaccine candidate is now being developed
for clinical trials pending a reformulation with a suitable
adjuvant and satisfactory re-testing in pre-clinical trials.
The DBP RII antigen is known to induce the production of
antibodies in a variety of species that by in vitro assay
block adhesion of red blood cells to the DBP [22-24,57]
and antibodies from immunized small animals and
infected humans apparently tend to show inhibition of
merozoite invasion in vitro in a field assay that produces
low invasion rates [57,56]. Whether or not immunization
of humans with this antigen will result in antibodies that
will effectively inhibit the invasion of red blood cells by
merozoites in vivo and, therefore impair parasite multiplication, remains to be shown. In the above mentioned trial
the DBP antibodies were exceptionally high-titered in the
partially protected Aotus monkeys, exhibiting strong inhibition of red cell binding at several magnitudes of dilution
and yet the animals still became infected and parasitaemia
levels increased after challenge. It must be remembered
that the DBP is sequestered in the micronemes and not
exposed to antibodies until probably just before or at the
time of contact with the reticulocyte and at that time
forms an irreversible bond with DARC and likely becomes
part of the moving junction [52,61]. There is a short
period of time for antibodies to act to neutralize the DBP/
Duffy interaction and whether much of this invasion ligand or important epitopes are exposed in the moving
junction to the host environment is not known. In this
regards it has been suggested that the DBP be combined
with another merozoite antigen, such as MSP-1 [21], but
a better choice might be AMA-1 because this combination
will concentrate the point of antibody attack at the
machinery of invasion by neutralizing simultaneously
two invasion ligands with different functions that are critical to parasite survival.
Merozoite Surface Protein-1
Plasmodium vivax MSP-1, like P. falciparum MSP-1, exhibits
allelic dimorphism as represented by the Belem and Salvador I strains, as well as other forms of diversity. [33,6264]. As it also undergoes a similar pattern of primary and
secondary proteolytic processing as P. falciparum MSP-1,
approximately 42 kDa and 19 kDa C-terminal fragments
are produced. P. vivax MSP-1p42 and MSP-1p19 vaccine
candidates produced by baculovirus expression [35] have
been tested in preclinical immunization trial conducted
in Saimiri boliviensis (squirrel monkeys), a host susceptible
to P. vivax infections, using FCA as the adjuvant (Barnwell,
Longacre and David, unpublished data). The immunized
squirrel monkeys produced tremendous titers of MSP-1
specific antibodies by ELISA on recombinant antigen (>5
× 106) and by IFA on native free merozoites or matured
schizonts (>1:40,000) of P. vivax (Belem strain). Sera
from MSP-1p42 and MSP-1p19 immunized rabbits and
monkeys inhibited in vitro merozoite invasion by 75–80%

and in vivo peak parasitaemia was reduced by 80 to 90%,
but there was no increase in the length of pre-patent periods from that of control animals after giving challenge
infections of 100,000 Belem strain blood-stage parasites.
Another immunization trial in Saimiri boliviensis utilized
yeast expressed MSP-1p19 formulated with alum and the
nonionic block copolymer P1005 ([65,66]. The block
copolymer P1005 was a potent adjuvant, inducing the
highest antibody titers as measured by ELISA and IFA and
a partial immunity where three of five monkeys had peak
parasitaemia <50 parasites/μl but two others were >
20,000 μl. The other immunization groups (MSP-1p19 +
alum and MSP-1p19 alone) and the control group were
similar to each other with at least one monkey in each
group of five or four, respectively, giving peak parasitaemia of < 1000 parasites/μl. However, here again, as noted
above, a line of Salvador I strain previously passed in
splenectomized animals was used in spleen intact monkeys, which were splenectomized one week after challenge with 100,000 parasites to allow parasite levels to
increase to be microscopically patent by thick blood film
(10 parasites/μl). Future trials should be conducted with
P. vivax strains that are adapted to grow uniformily in
non-splenectomized monkeys to be able to more reliably
interpret results as the spleen is of central importance factor in malaria erythrocytic stage biology and immunity
[67-72].

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/7/S1/S9

parasitological parameters observed for each of the immunized groups as compared to the control group suggested
a cross-protective immune response with this different,
but genetically related parasite [78]. Surprisingly, however, though there is only a 75–80% identity between the
P. cynomolgi and P. vivax antigens, there were no significant differences between any of the antigens used for
immunization in the degree of protection provided except
for the soluble P. vivax MSP-1p42 vaccine, which showed
the greatest decreases in parasite burdens. Nevertheless, in
this study all monkeys became positive, with no differences in prepatent periods and in the early acute phases of
infection the rapid rate of parasitemic increases were the
same as in the control group. Peak parasitaemia were
reached somewhat sooner in the immunized animals
than in control monkeys with a reduction of 60 to 75%.
This picture of no discernable effect on early parasitaemias with a protective immune response kicking in after a
period of active infection is a phenomenon seen with
most MSP-1 immunizations, whether with P. falciparum,
P. vivax or P. cynomolgi. At this time there is no indication
that this vaccine formulation is being positioned for
inclusion in a clinical trial.

Plasmodium cynomolgi, a simian malaria parasite, is nearly
identical in morphology and biology and genetically very
closely related to P. vivax and in its macaque monkey
hosts offer valuable models for the study of vivax malaria
[73,74]. The structure of a P. cynomolgi counterpart of P.
vivax MSP-1p19 has been determined by X-ray crystallography at 1.8 angstrom resolution [75]. This P. cynomolgi
baculovirus expressed MSP-1p19 counterpart vaccine has
been used for immunization trials in toque monkeys,
Macaca sinica, a natural host of P. cynomolgi in Sri Lanka
[76]. Significant levels of protection ranging from transient parasitaemia to completely negative outcomes were
achieved in this model with FCA adjuvant formulations.
Antibody titers by ELISA (>106) and IFA (>5 × 104) were
sustained at high levels over the course of the study.

A third P. vivax MSP-1 vaccine candidate antigen representing a 359 amino acid N-terminal portion of the Belem
strain MSP-1 is known as Pv200L. It was produced in E.
coli and the purified antigen was tested for immunogenicity and efficacy in A. griseimembra [79]. Not unexpectedly,
the Pv200L recombinant antigen when formulated in FCA
was highly immunogenic producing very high ELISA titers
(>107), but only modest (1:2,000) IFA titers. Despite the
extraordinarily high specific antibody levels as measured
by ELISA, there were no statistically significant differences
between the vaccine immunized and control animals,
again with peak parasitaemia and other parasitic parameters being relatively low in this model system using the
Salvador I strain of P. vivax as the challenge parasite in owl
(Aotus) monkeys [79]. Nevertheless, one prospective
study has indicated there is a reduced risk of infection and
clinical protection associated with antibodies to the N-terminal region of PvMSP1 [80], which is contrary to the prevailing conventional wisdom that the C-terminus of MSP1 is the principal target of protective antibodies.

More recently, a PvMSP-1p42 E. coli-derived antigen was
produced in two forms, soluble and insoluble, which was
re-folded after solubilization, and used with Montanide
ISA 720 as adjuvant to immunize rhesus monkeys [77].
Counterpart soluble and refolded P. cynomolgi MSP-1p42
antigens were also prepared and used to immunize rhesus
monkeys using Montanide ISA 720 as adjuvant. Certainly,
there were some surprises when the MSP-1p42 immunized monkeys were then cross-challenged with P.
cynomolgi [78]. Statistically significant decreases of several

Apical Membrane Antigen-1
Soon after its gene was characterized in 1997, the immunogenicity of an AMA-1 yeast product in rhesus monkeys
was reported in 1999 [38]. The GSK adjuvant, AS02 was
used with the antigen for immunization and ELISA titers
were >2 × 105 and IFA titers were >1:10,000 after the third
immunization. These animals were also challenged with
P. cynomolgi and unlike in the case of MSP-1p42 noted
above this cross-species challenge did not show any differences in parasitemic factors in the AMA-1 immunized

group compared to the control animals. Basic studies have
continued to show 1) its structure by X-ray crystallography
[81,82], 2) phylogenetic structural comparisons to AMA1 orthologs in other species [83], and 3) a few surveys of
polymorphism or immunogenicity in Asia and the Americas [84-86]. However, there seems to be little further
efforts in pre-clinical development to elevate it to phase I
clinical testing at this time. As with MSP-1, AMA-1 is a
prime candidate for P. falciparum blood-stage candidates
and several P. falciparum products are in phase I and phase
II clinical trials in the field. An efficacy trial in a suitable
monkey model for P. vivax (see below) could likely provide the kind of data that is needed to drive this candidate
into phase I and phase II clinical trials, if the ongoing clinical trials of P. falciparum AMA-1 prove to be promising.
Merozoite Surface Protein-3
Another leading asexual blood-stage candidate vaccine
antigen for P. falciparum is MSP-3, which is also undergoing clinical trials in Africa [87,88]. MSP-3 homologs also
exist in P. vivax, and while similar enough to strongly indicate relatedness to PfMSP-3, the antigens expressed in P.
vivax comprise a gene family with unique structural and
antigenic characteristics [35,36]. In the Salvador I strain,
the genome project has revealed eleven msp-3 genes of
similar character in P. vivax distributed head-to-toe in a
single locus [16]. All eleven genes encode putative proteins that share the same structural characteristics of a
large alanine-rich central domain of heptad repeats forming coiled coils tertiary structure [35,36]. This gene family
also shows considerable intraspecies variation characterized by numerous nonsynonymous SNPs and indels particularly in the central core domain [89,90]. Twelve years
ago, immunization of Saimiri boliviensis monkeys with
two products of the PvMSP-3 family (PvMSP-3α and
PvMSP-3β) expressed in E. coli and using FCA induced
strong immune responses in the form of antibodies as
determined by IFA (titers of 1:10,240 to 40,960) and
ELISA (titers >106) (Barnwell and Galinski, unpublished
data). Additionally, MSP-3α/β was shown to produce a
modest level of protection by reducing peak parasitaemia
by 60–70% and attenuating the course of infection in the
spleen-intact squirrel monkeys infected with the Belem
strain. Recently, immunization of Saimiri boliviensis with
E. coli expressed recombinant 6His-PvMSP-3α formulated
in Montanide ISA-720 did not confer protection (Jiang,
Barnwell & Galinski, unpublished data). Considering the
number of msp-3 genes potentially expressed in P. vivax
merozoites and the allelic diversity demonstrated by this
antigen family it may be an insurmountable challenge to
develop a vaccine based on MSP-3 for P. vivax. On the
other hand, some data suggest that one of the eleven msp3
genes may be over expressed relative to the others (Jiang,
Barnwell & Galinski, unpublished data) and this could be
a predominantly expressed family member.

Other potential blood-stage vaccine candidates
Members of the Reticulocye Binding Protein-Like (RBL)
family of proteins certainly should be considered as
potential candidates to be included in malaria bloodstage vaccines as an important set of invasion ligands
functionally expressed by merozoites [44,91]. Plasmodium
vivax preferentially invades reticulocytes presumably by
the selective attachment of members of the Reticulocyte
Binding Protein (RBP) family, such as PvRBP-1 and
PvRBP-2 [6,40,41]. The use of short-term cultured P. vivax
schizont-infected RBCs for robust in vitro merozoite invasion inhibition assays [50], have shown that polyclonal
antibodies raised against certain regions of PvRBP-1 and
PvRBP-2 expressed in E. coli are capable of modestly
inhibiting invasion of the P. vivax merozoite by 20–40%
(Barnwell, unpublished data). The reticulocyte binding
regions of PvRBP-1 and PvRBP-2 have been mapped to a
region of the N-terminus of these large proteins (>300
kDa) through expression on the surface of COS cells (G.
Rosas et al., unpublished data) and further pre-clinical
investigation, such as optimizing in E. coli and/or yeast
RBP subunit expression and further testing of structurefunction requirements through reticulocyte binding
assays as well as conducting non-human primate trials for
immunogenicity, formulation and efficacy will likely
guide whether this class of vaccine antigens will advance
to clinical trials. Studies with patient samples are also
beginning to provide relevant data regarding polymorphism and naturally acquired immunity to these proteins
[92,93].

Additionally, the sequencing of the P. vivax genome has
brought to light new rbl family members as potential players for pre-clinical evaluation as vaccine candidates. Their
discovery may also help to understand the molecular
mechanisms underpinning basic fitness requirements and
alternative pathways of this parasite, such as the preferential invasion of reticulocytes through the attachment of
members of the RBP family [6,40,41]. In addition to the
two original RBPs (PvRBP-1 and PvRBP-2) there are at
least five additional rbl genes in the genome. But caution
is advised, since these new gene sequences represent both
pseudogenes and bona fide expressed genes (Meyer, Barnwell and Galinski, unpublished data); this is a case in
point, that although the P. vivax genome is available,
annotation and validation of the 5,000+ genes identified
need to now take center stage. One next step to progress
the RBLs in the vivax vaccine pipeline is to complement
the P. vivax genome database with regards to knowledge
on the expression and interplay of the original and newly
identified rbl members in P. vivax.
Another antigen for possible consideration as a vivax vaccine candidate is the Merozoite Surface Protein-9 (MSP-9)
[42]. Plasmodium vivax MSP-9 is encoded by a highly con-

served gene, and ortholog genes are present in P. falciparum, in rodent malaria species and in the simian
malaria species, Plasmodium coatneyi, P. cynomolgi, and P.
knowlesi [94]. The N-terminal region of MSP-9 is conserved and polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies will
inhibit merozoite invasion [42,95]. Naturally exposed
individuals have shown significant humoral and cellular
responses, and in fact, an immunodominant epitope has
been identified and further work will determine if this
immunodominant epitope is capable of eliciting a protective response against vivax malaria [96].
It is made evident by the above summary of antigens and
vivax blood-stage vaccine candidates that there is a severe
need to keep the pump for the vaccine candidate pipeline
well-primed. The sequencing of the genome of P. vivax has
been a step in that direction and, in fact, this vivax genome
database is already providing new genes and data that will
very likely increase the pool of blood-stage vaccine candidates in the near future.
Transmission blocking vaccines
The target antigens of transmission blocking vaccines
(TBV) are exposed in the sexual stages of the parasite, the
gamete, zygote and ookinete, in the gut of the mosquito
after she has taken a blood meal containing circulating
male and female gametocytes. Early studies on transmission-blocking immunity (TBI) indicated the primary
mechanism of action was through antibody assisted by
complement and more recent studies indicate that antibody-mediated blocking of oocyst formation is a reliable
in vitro correlate of TBI [97-99]. The primary candidate
antigens for TBV in P. vivax can be said to essentially be
the same suspects as for P. falciparum: Pvs230, Pvs48/45,
Pvs28 and Pvs25. Pv230 and Pv48/45 are still in waiting
to be brought into preclinical studies primarily because of
problems in efficient and structurally sound recombinant
expression, although monoclonal antibodies have indicated in the past that these are important targets of TBI
[100-102]. Despite the challenges facing the production
of TBVs, their promise in adding a critical tool to the few
available for control of malaria transmission is exceptional. But, at the current pace, this is like "Waiting for
Godot".
Pvs25
At this time, for P. vivax TBV, Pvs25 is by far the most
advanced candidate having undergone extensive pre-clinical testing and development and it has been in early
phase I clinical trials. Pvs25 can be produced efficiently as
a recombinant in yeast [103] and earlier pre-clinical testing in mice and non-human primates had indicated that
antibody responses could be generated that would cause a
70–100% reduction in both the number of infected mosquitoes and in oocyst burden in infected mosquitoes

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/7/S1/S9

using adjuvants such as Montanide ISA 720 and Alum
[99,104-108]. While Pvs25 antibody titers could generally
remain elevated in New World primates, in rhesus monkeys maximum transmission-blocking titers required a
second appropriately timed booster and then declined
over the next few weeks and months [99,107,108]. In two
clinical trials, one with an Alum formulation showed
moderate transmission blocking antibody titers could be
obtained with this adjuvant, but the second trial was curtailed due to reactogenicity of the antigen and Montanide
ISA 51 adjuvant, which was deemed too frequent and
severe including some with systemic reactions [29,30].
Further studies on increasing and sustaining Pvs25 transmission blocking antibody titers and providing safer, but
potent adjuvant formulations are of immediate importance [109,110]. Another track for TBV development has
been to use DNA vaccines encoding Pvs25 and Pvs28,
which at least in mice has produced respectable blocking
antibody titers [111]. It will also be important, in parallel,
to speed up the pre-clinical selection of other new sexual
stage antigens such as CTRP [112] and WARP [113] along
with research on the expression of Pvs230 and Pvs48/45
to broaden and enhance the transmission blocking effectiveness of these vaccines that will be critical for increasing
the chances of controlling and eliminating P. vivax
malaria.
Pre-erythrocytic (sporozoite and liver stage) candidate
antigens and vaccines
Like the asexual blood stage, vaccine development targeting vivax malaria pre-erythrocytic stages has mostly concentrated on those orthologs of antigens already being
studied for P. falciparum vaccine development. Plasmodium vivax pre-erythrocytic vaccines target two sporozoite
antigens, the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) and thrombospondin-related anonymous protein (TRAP) antigens,
which are conserved across many species of Plasmodium.
Following in the foot-steps of P. falciparum CSP vaccine
efforts, a nearly full-length PvCSP was first recombinantly
synthesized in yeast in 1987 [114]. This PvCSP recombinant antigen and PvCSP repeat unit peptide vaccines
were tested in a Bolivian squirrel (S. boliviensis) monkeyP. vivax challenge model providing little or no protective
effects [115-119]. Clinical trials with yeast-derived PvCSP
were disappointing and showed low immunogenicity and
essentially mirrored results from the efficacy tests in New
World monkeys [120]. Similar results were obtained with
early P. falciparum CSP vaccines in clinical challenge studies in malaria naïve human subjects, until RTS, S, the chimeric PfCSP/Hepatitis B surface protein construct, gave
partial protection lasting a few weeks to several months
when combined with a saponin-based adjuvant [121124]. Plasmodium vivax multiple antigen constructs
(MACs) of CSP vaccines have shown some protection in
New World monkeys against P. vivax sporozoite challenge

Page 7 of 18

Malaria Journal 2008, 7(Suppl 1):S9

showing 40% efficacy or less that waned over several
months [125], which is similar to the efficacy reported in
field trials for RTS, S. The multiple antigen peptide vehicles though have lost popularity because of the difficulties
in providing batch-to-batch consistency. Nevertheless, in
this non-human primate trial antibodies were produced
against the AGDR B-cell epitope found in the repeat
amino acid units of the VK-210 allele of the P. vivax CSP.
This epitope was a correlate of protection in that a mouse
monoclonal antibody recognizing this epitope was highly
protective upon passive transfer in squirrel monkeys
[118]. However, humans or monkeys previously immunized with P. vivax CSP vaccine constructs did not produce
antibodies to the AGDR epitope although they recognized
the repeat unit peptides [118,119].
Only recently have vivax malaria vaccine studies based on
PvCSP been revisited since the initial studies first undertaken a decade or two ago. Unlike P. falciparum, P. vivax
has two different alleles of the csp gene (VK210 and VK247
or type I and type II, respectively) with the encoded repeat
amino acid unit differing in sequence between the two
alleles [126]. Currently, PvCSP vaccine candidates are
being made in the form of chimeric recombinant proteins
expressed in E. coli and encoding both types of repeat
units [29] or as three long synthetic peptides covering portions of the N-terminal, C-terminal and repeat regions of
PvCSP (Salvador I strain) and directed to one allele
[26,27]. Studies with the E. coli expressed chimeric recombinant protein are just beginning in non-human primate
trials and early phase I trials are being planned. The long
synthetic peptide vaccine formulated in Montanide ISA
720 has been through trials in both non-human primates
(Aotus l. griseimembra) and a phase Ia clinical trial showing
immunogenicity by eliciting good antibody responses
(ELISA and IFA) and γIFN production, the latter particularly in response to live sporozoite exposure in owl (Aotus)
monkeys [27]. However, in each case, human and nonhuman primates, challenge with live P. vivax sporozoites
was not reported.
A long synthetic peptide of a region of PvTRAP has also
been synthesized and in pre-clinical studies was used to
immunize A. griseimembra monkeys, which were subsequently challenged with a wildtype isolate of P. vivax sporozoites acquired by feeding Anopheles albimanus
mosquitoes on a patient [127]. Although four out of six
control monkeys became positive for blood-stage parasites and only two out of six developed an infection in the
vaccine group, the result was statistically not significant
and must be interpreted that in this small trial no protection was demonstrated. This result, though, is also similar
to results for PvCSP vaccine constructs in past clinical trials and non-human primate immunization studies noted
above.

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/7/S1/S9

Although called pre-erythrocytic vaccines, most development has concentrated on the abundantly expressed surface protein of sporozoites, CSP, which is important in
motility and hepatocyte invasion [128]. First described as
an immunodominant antigen, it is becoming clear from
past vaccine studies and more recent investigations that
the CSP alone will induce a level of immunity, but this
immunity is incomplete and leaky [124,129]. The CSP
thus is a functionally competent component of a preerythrocytic vaccine, but it is likely going to be insufficient
to generate a solid immunity as would be required for this
type of vaccine and other liver-stage antigens are likely
needed to generate the solid immunity exhibited by attenuated sporozoites [130]. Recently, there has been a popular notion that combining a pre-erythrocytic component
with an erythrocytic component will produce a more efficacious malaria vaccine. Given the mutually exclusive
immunity generally obtained between the pre-erythrocytic and erythrocytic parasite stages, it is unlikely that
combining two antigens which each generate partial,
incomplete immunities against their respective developmental forms will necessarily improve upon the overall
protective efficacy of a vaccine. Whether the parasite load
in the liver is effectively reduced 30% or 90% in an immunized individual, one or two escaping liver schizonts will
produce thousands of merozoites igniting an acute bloodstage infection to be handled by another partially effective
immune response. Perhaps, it would be better to combine
CSP with other sporozoite or liver-stage antigens to make
a pre-erythrocytic vaccine that is much more of an effective barrier on liver-stage development and then similarly
combine selected merozoite surface and ligand antigens
to achieve a more effective blood-stage vaccine.
Live, attenuated sporozoite vaccines
A major effort is now being made to bring about a P. falciparum pre-erythrocytic vaccine based upon either radiation or genetically attenuated sporozoites [131,132].
Experiments performed over thirty years ago with radiation attenuated, live sporozoites, which, by the way, were
injected by living, feeding mosquitoes, were the first direct
proof of principle that a human malaria vaccine could be
feasible [133]. However, in these past studies, less than a
couple of dozen individuals were fed upon by irradiated,
P. falciparum or P. vivax sporozoite infected mosquitoes
and 16 had been observed to be solidly protected upon
challenge with normal fully infective sporozoites [133135]. In these 16 individuals, protection apparently lasted
between 2.5 and 10.5 months for P. falciparum and
around six months for P. vivax. Indeed, for P. vivax, the
number of immunized and protected individuals sensitized through the mosquito bite injection of sporozoites
was a grand total of two.

A P. vivax attenuated sporozoite vaccine is certainly being
considered, but poses a number of challenges. Most
importantly, a major challenge would be the limited, or in
reality, non-existent sources for reproducibly acquiring
standardized P. vivax sporozoites for attenuation. This is
worth noting given the lack of a practical continuous culture system that would provide infective gametocytes or
the ethical considerations that surround the ability to
infect humans with cloned lines of P. vivax or a genetically
altered line of parasites in order to feed mosquitoes and
produce infected mosquitoes with attenuated sporozoites.
Efforts are being made to develop a human challenge system for P. vivax to evaluate vivax malaria vaccines by feeding upon patients with vivax malaria in Colombia and
Thailand, but this has its drawbacks, even as a challenge
system, as the parasites will be a heterogeneous mixtures
of genotypes and it will be difficult to sort out results of
vaccine trials. This is particularly true as immunizations
will be based upon antigen alleles likely to differ from
those present in the challenge inoculum.
While prison volunteers were infected with P. vivax and
fed upon to infect mosquitoes in the past [73,136], this
practice has since been judged unethical and it is not
likely that at present anyone will convince ethically suitable volunteers to go through "benign" vivax malaria infections long enough to efficiently infect large numbers of
mosquitoes that will produce heavy loads of sporozoites.
Although chimpanzees were used to infect tens of thousands of mosquitoes with billions of sporozoites from
various strains of P. vivax in the past, they are no longer
generally available for these purposes due to restrictions
imposed by current ethical considerations for the treatment and use of great apes.
Clearly, a cataloguing of what genes in the P. vivax
genome are expressed during hepatic stage development
needs to be generated in order to adequately develop
genetically attenuated sporozoites or, more urgently, to
advance recombinant sub-unit pre-erythrocytic vaccines.
Two products, LSA-1 and LSA-3, identified from genes
expressed during parasite development in the hepatocyte
in P. falciparum are candidates for falciparum pre-erythrocytic malaria vaccines [137,138], but these genes apparently do not exist in P. vivax. Other liver-stage genes
specific for P. vivax need to be discovered and exploration
in this area will be facilitated given the availability of the
P. vivax genome [16]. Identifying liver-stage antigens that
might be most useful for generating effective recombinant
protein based or viral-vectored vaccines, which may or
may not include CSP or TRAP components should be the
priority. Albeit, in the near term, there will be difficulties
in generating necessary and reliable post-genomic data on
hepatic-stage parasites to identify these parasite products
if the appropriate non-human primate animal model sys-

tems and associated expertise are not developed, maintained and utilized. This includes, most importantly, the
study of the enigmatic hypnozoite.
Hypnozoites and liver stage biology: a challenge to
malaria vaccines
The most outstanding feature of P. vivax biology in regards
to a challenge for control interventions is the ability of
this parasite to form dormant hypnozoites in the liver,
which when reactivated weeks, months or years later create new blood-stage infections through a true liver-stage
relapse mechanism [139,140]. In regards to immunity,
whether acquired naturally or actively through induction
by immunization, this metabolically quiescent stage
poses a challenge to vaccines directed against P. vivax.
Next to nothing is known about the bio-physiology of this
stage of the parasite and certainly minimally about the
immunological recognition of and immune response to
hypnozoites in the liver.

Hypnozoites, as the mechanism behind relapses, are
found in P. vivax, presumably P. ovale, and the monkey
malarias, Plasmodium simiovale, Plasmodium fieldi and P.
cynomolgi, all of which are very closely related to P. vivax
[73,74,139,141,142]. First coined in 1977 [143], it was
not until 1980 that hypnozoites were identified in the
liver tissue of a rhesus monkey injected with millions of
sporozoites of P. cynomolgi [144,145] and, shortly thereafter, in a chimpanzee inoculated with P. vivax sporozoites
[146,147]. These forms appear as nondescript small intrahepatic round single-nucleated bodies about 4.5 μm in
diameter. But what is a hypnozoite in terms of its metabolic activity and immune recognition? This is not known
but obviously to remain in a hepatocyte, perhaps for a
year and more, it must simultaneously exist under stasis
with reduced metabolic activity and yet control and alter
its host cell (inhibiting apoptosis?). Only primaquine and
related 8-aminoquinolines are known to attack and kill
hypnozoites although there are other antimalarial drugs
that will destroy primary exo-erythrocytic schizonts providing radical cure in non-relapsing malarias [148,149].
This quiescent liver stage could similarly pose a problem
for any pre-erythrocytic stage vaccine; by presenting a low
metabolic and antigenic profile allowing the parasite to
stealthily slip past the defenses of an immunized host, as
they wane or fail to react in time when the parasite is reactivated. It is also known that relapse parasite populations
produced from reactivated hypnozoites are quite often
antigenically distinct from the primary parasitaemia and
previously relapsed infections [150,151], possibly allowing a breakthrough relapse population to escape restricted
immune responses induced by a blood-stage vaccine.
Many of the obvious questions regarding P. vivax, hypnozoites, vaccines and immune recognition could be
explored now since robust model host-parasite systems

such as P. cynomolgi or P. simiovale in rhesus macaques
exist [142,152-154] or, for that matter, a few specific P.
vivax strains that permit relapse infections can be observed
and studied in Aotus nancymaae.
Out of six squirrel (Saimiri boliviensis) monkeys, each
receiving intravenously 1.5 million P. vivax sporozoites
irradiated with 15 krads, only two were fully protected
upon challenge with live, virulent P. vivax sporozoites
[115]. Since, on the other hand, only two humans have
been immunized with radiation-attenuated sporozoites of
P. vivax, it is difficult to compare results between nonhuman primates and human clinical experiments. Nevertheless, only two monkeys were protected and in this
model system it is not known if hypnozoites were also
eliminated along with primary schizonts, as relapse parasitaemia, unfortunately, has never been observed in this
model of P. vivax and, therefore, it is unknown if viable
hypnozoites ever existed.
Plasmodium cynomolgi in rhesus monkeys, an excellent surrogate model for P. vivax in humans, has not been adequately utilized to sort out and address the many
questions posed by hypnozoites and their impact on
acquired immunity. If effective protection can be induced
by an attenuated or sub-unit pre-erythrocytic vaccine
against primary liver trophozoites and schizonts of P.
vivax (or P. cynomolgi) will that vaccine provide protection
against hypnozoites that may reactivate weeks, months
and sometimes year or more later? The one and only
immunization trial undertaken to immunize macaque
monkeys against P. cynomolgi pre-erythrocytic stages used
70,000 and 125,000 irradiated (13 krads) sporozoites
injected intravenously into two animals, which upon
challenge were only partially protected as shown by delays
in patent infection of two and five days compared to one
control monkey [155]. Given this experiment was carried
out with only three monkeys, it is evident more studies
need to be done. Using reliable primate malaria models it
will be critical to have indications of whether pre-erythrocytic vaccines when effective against the primary tissue
stages will also be effective against the relapse causing
hypnozoites to prevent further relapses or dramatically
reduce the number of relapses. Sub-optimal doses of radiation (6.5 to 8.5 krads) will reduce the number but not
the pattern of relapse episodes in P. cynomolgi, just as will
reducing the number of sporozoites inoculated in P. vivax
or P. cynomolgi, [156,157]. However, trying to determine
this kind of data, ie, whether a vaccine is preventing or
reducing relapse rates, from human trials, especially in
field settings, will present many obstacles and challenges
that might not be readily overcome, if ever.

Rebuilding a pipeline of candidates undergoing pre-clinical
evaluations to reignite the advancement of vivax vaccines
into clinical testing
In the current time-frame of malaria vaccine research, HIV
vaccine research has taken a number of steps back along
the pathway of development and many now advocate a
need for further basic research prior to more clinical vaccine testing [158]. Malaria vaccine researchers may also be
drawing close to the same line of action, if present P. falciparum vaccine candidates in clinical trials continue to
not fulfill their expected promise. Although this will be
less shocking as malaria researchers have knowingly
remained too optimistically focused on a few antigens,
while being keenfully aware of the much larger genome
and complex biology of Plasmodium. It would certainly
seem to be prudent sooner than later to vigorously again
prime the pipeline with new vaccine candidates to consider and evaluate pre-clinically. This is especially true for
vivax malaria vaccine development where, as we have
noted above, there are really only two or three P. vivax vaccine candidates heading into early clinical trials and very
few others in the pipeline undergoing serious preclinical
evaluation with any adequate form of support. Simply
put, more candidates need to enter this pipeline and the
genome is ripe with potential targets.

Certainly, the sequencing and initial annotation of the
genome of P. vivax [16] is one development that will
greatly facilitate the feeding of the vivax malaria vaccine
pipeline. There is yet much to be learned about the specific biology and the intricate details of the genes that
determine the life cycle and host interactions of P. vivax
and the functioning of its large genome comprising over
5,000 genes. Consequently, it is with high expectations
that out of this genomic database relevant vaccine (and
drug) interventions will come to light, and thus new candidates for vivax malaria vaccines will be revealed. With
that said, the vivax vaccine development field now faces
the challenge of post-genomic deciphering of the data
now available from the P. vivax genome (Sal I strain)
sequence. However, to accompany this (and future)
genomic information reliable and relevant transcriptome,
proteome and other types of 'ome data for the various life
stages of P. vivax will be important to realistically mine
this information [159], the provision of which may have
more challenges than realized.
Of course, it has become clear to some that simply targeting the predominant surface coat proteins of sporozoites
and merozoites, which were identified long ago in the
wake of molecular technological approaches for vaccine
development, may not reliably result in effective malaria
vaccines capable of inducing high levels of protection.
There will indeed be benefits from defining and understanding immunological correlates of protection, and

Page 10 of 18

dedicating more effort to testing new robust adjuvants to
help achieve protective immune responses. Although this
applies to malaria vaccines in general, in vivax malaria it is
of considerable and central importance because of the
lack of a practical in vitro system of continuous cultivation
and a more dependant reliance on the use of human clinical cases and non-human primates for propagating the
various developmental forms of P. vivax along with the
relevant simian malarias and investigating host and parasite interactions.

In vitro systems for production of infective gametocytes,
certainly critical for P. falciparum TBV and PEV development, will also be critical for vivax malaria vaccine development, but will, naturally, be dependent on success with
asexual blood-stage culture development. Of course, there
still could be other challenges even with a robust asexual
culture methodology for P. vivax given observations that
gametocyte production is lost on continuous culture of P.
knowlesi and P. cynomolgi [166,167], parasite species kindred to P. vivax.

P. vivax and the in vitro 'crockpot'
As much as it has been desired, and various rigorous
efforts have been made towards this goal over a long
period of time starting in 1912 [160], there is still no reliable, practical system for the long-term culture of the asexual blood and gametocyte stages of P. vivax. In-vitro
culture of P. falciparum first became a reality in 1976.
While there has been a productive method in use for the
short-term culture of P. vivax with reinvasion of human or
non-human primate reticulocytes since 1989 [49], P. vivax
after the initial round of positive reinvasion tends to rapidly decrease in numbers and invasion efficiency with
subsequent rounds of invasion even when fresh reticulocytes are supplied [161,162]. The most successful attempt
with P. vivax, along the lines of current culture techniques
for P. falciparum, was for 12 days of positive growth with
an average two-fold multiplication rate, requiring media
changes twice a day and a fresh supply of blood highly
enriched in reticulocytes every 48 hours; clearly a difficult
task [163]. This effort has not been successfully repeated
since, although recently cord blood has been used to supply reticulocytes with a very low level of parasites maintained for one month [164]. More recent culture attempts
have utilized culture systems of haematopoietic tissue and
stems cells to continuously produce a lineage of erythroid
developmental forms that include reticulocytes, which are
then supplanted with P. vivax-infected erythrocytes from
patients to initiate the continuous P. vivax cultures [165].
In general, although the vivax parasites in some cultures
lasted over 30 days (>15 growth cycles), with one up to 85
days, the levels of parasites remained very low and culture
maintenance is relatively expensive.

Plasmodium vivax, non-human primates and in vivo test
tubes
In the absence of in vitro culture, the only available sources
of material to directly investigate the genetics, biology,
metabolism, immunity or pathology of P. vivax are
infected humans and New World monkeys. Until recently,
chimpanzees have been used to study P. vivax liver stages
and provide thousands of mosquitoes heavily infected
with sporozoites of P. vivax, but recently with increasing
concern for using chimpanzees in research these kinds of
valuable studies have declined and ceased. Many clinical
studies, primarily limited to endemic regions, are able to
utilize parasites collected from patients to study genetics
or, as recently published, to develop a transcriptome profile [159] or for TBI and mosquito infectivity
[106,168,169]. Certainly, many aspects of immunity and
pathology are also desirably investigated in the intermediate host of P. vivax, humans. However, complete reliance
on this source can present challenges and problematic circumstances. Fortunately, P. vivax can infect and be
adapted to a number of species of New World monkeys.

Improvements in these approaches are certainly needed
and based on initial results further attempts are warranted. In the absence of a continuous culture for P. vivax
blood stages, other more recent experiments to guide vaccine development have utilized infected blood from
patients in short-term cultures of one growth cycle to perform merozoite invasion or growth inhibition assays [57].
But this method of evaluating vaccine targets, because of
a lack of robust merozoite reinvasion and the genetic differences in the parasite populations that are used with
each culture assay, is problematic and made less desirable.

Over the past two or three decades, a significant number
of isolates of P. vivax (>40) have been partially or fully
adapted to infect and grow well in various species of New
World monkeys such as A. l. griseimembra, A. nancymaae
and Saimiri boliviensis to name the most propitious hosts.
These model systems of P. vivax infection will vary by the
particular host and parasite strain combination with
regards to what biology they are best suited to study. They
have been used to infect mosquitoes for sporozoite production, in vivo challenge infections with sporozoites, and
provide viable parasites for genetic transformation [170]
and various immuno-biological and pre-clinical vaccine
studies.
New World primate models that have been developed to
evaluate pre-erythrocytic vaccines include selected strains
in the compatible hosts, such as Brazil VII or Panama I in
Aotus nancymaae or Salvador I in Saimiri boliviensis
[117,171,172]. Other strains of monkey adapted P. vivax
such as Belem and Palo Alto (Vietnam IV) because of consistent and high parasitaemia in non-splenectomized
hosts are particularly suited for testing blood-stage vac-

cines [173]. P. simium, a natural adaptation of P. vivax in
South American howler and spider monkeys can be used
in either Saimiri or Aotus species to evaluate either preerythrocytic or blood-stage vaccines [174].
Moreover, the malaria parasites most closely related to P.
vivax, P. cynomolgi and P. simiovale, are likely to be slated
for genome sequencing in the near future along with new
strains of P. vivax. Thus, the potential for increasing
knowledge about P. vivax and investigator's capabilities
for identifying new vaccine targets is at this time very high
if model systems are also supported along with efforts to
develop in vitro culture systems. Importantly, in the case
of P. vivax, the simian malaria models, such as P. cynomolgi
and P. simiovale, have historically served as crucial aids to
decipher P. vivax biology and identify functionally important proteins. Without these primate host models for P.
vivax and the very close kin relationship of the simian
malaria, P. cynomolgi, in macaques, a lot less would have
been accomplished over the past several decades in ongoing attempts to formulate a knowledge base on this
neglected parasite.
Recently there has been a trend to use "humanized" mice
to study blood-stage P. falciparum [175] and there are
hopeful attempts to be able to include the pre-erythrocytic
stages by transplanting human liver tissue in these highly
immuno-compromized mice [176]. Similarly, there are
designs to attempt to infect these "humanized" mice with
the blood stages and sporozoites of P. vivax, but one has
to really question whether these "models" represent solid
experimental tools or are merely expensive in vivo test
tubes of living tissues and organs that will be of narrowly
targeted and limited value, which may also not provide
credible data. An interesting twist, though, on using a
rodent malaria model to study P. vivax is the recent genetic
transformation of Plasmodium berghei that created a chimeric parasite by exchanging P. berghei s25 with the s25
gene from P. vivax to analyse TBV antibodies against this
human parasite [177]. However, an alternative and, perhaps, a more promising avenue to study P. vivax vaccines
and to decipher this species' biology would be to use
genetic exchange transformation of P. cynomolgi or P. simiovale with P. vivax genes, or elements, as has been done for
P. knowlesi with the P. falciparum CSP gene (C Kocken, personal communication).
Research agenda for P. vivax vaccines
Because vivax research has been neglected for decades, the
research needs agenda can look like a large wish list. However, the truth is that with today's technologies and eager
scientists who are willing to collaborate and coordinate,
much headway can be made rather quickly, assuming the
provision of resources. Decades ago, prior to the genome
era, research was slow and laborious, perhaps akin to the

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/7/S1/S9

use of typewriters before the computer age and the Internet. Today, researchers can move quickly in unchartered
territory, and the use of shared biological and electronic
resources and data will expedite discovery. Rather than
develop vaccines with a first come first serve approach, in
reference to the top 10 proteins revealed through traditional methodologies, experts can really aim to find the
Achilles heel, the most essential and vulnerable target sites
of this parasite species. In this vein, one needs to know thy
parasite better by also focusing on its unique features,
including the hypnozoite, the reticulocyte host cell preference, and the specialized caveolae vesicle complex (CVC)
structures it makes as it takes over the red blood cell, for
both asexual and sexual stage progeny. There is also the
need to better understand the pathogenic features, transmission cycle differences, and vector biology peculiarities
compared to P. falciparum, as there are bound to be lessons that are relevant for the consideration of vivax vaccines, as well as future multi-species vaccines, which
ultimately may be the best way to eliminate and ultimately eradicate this disease.
• Additional genome sequencing, transcriptome, proteome, structural biology, and other types of integrated
systems research should be a priority. Without question,
additional P. vivax and complementary simian malaria
genomic data will help to reveal the genes and proteins of
critical importance to the biology of these parasites. Postgenomic information is especially needed for pre-erythrocytic and sexual stages.
• Studies on the biology of P. vivax and the simian malaria
parasites should be emphasized, with cataloguing of characteristics that are in common with P. falciparum, but, perhaps more importantly, those that are unique to P. vivax.
Of major concern to many, the P. vivax liver-stage forms
will be exceptionally challenging to study and this area of
research is in need of dedicated resources. In addition, P.
vivax researchers lack a continuous in vitro culture system
to propagate blood-stage parasites. However, in the face of
these challenges, there can be greater coordination and
expanded use of P. vivax (and P. cynomolgi) infections in
non-human primates to help circumvent these drawbacks. It remains uncertain if the development of a reliable continuous in vitro culture will be feasible, or not.
Meanwhile, non-human primate infections can provide
both liver-stage and blood-stage parasites for in-depth
characterization and the identification of new vivax
malaria vaccine targets. Despite the limitations in studying blood samples from patients, small volumes of blood
from field samples can also continue to provide important genetic and biological information and opportunities
for working in the field need to be expanded.

• Strategic directions and collaborations are then needed
to funnel target candidate antigens and approaches
through an express vaccine pre-clinical pipeline. Contrary
to research as usual, we must be able to 'let go' of favourite
antigens, platforms, etc.
• Researchers must crack the code of the hypnozoite, a
black box at the moment, which can also be viewed as a
Pandora's Box. Hypnozoites will continue to hide away
and produce illness, if not tackled head on. Malaria eradication may be unreachable if hypnozoites are not better
understood and eliminated via vaccination or a new effective drug for radical cure.
• Models, models, models! These are so much needed for
P. vivax vaccine research, both in vitro and in vivo. Investment is needed to establish and improve upon possible
model systems, and, importantly, keep honing the specialized expertise needed to work with non-human primates, malaria infections, and pre-clinical vaccine trials.
• Training, training, training! What is not accomplished in
the next decade, in the aim to eradicate malaria, must be
handed down successfully to future generations to continue in these steps, or humanity must accept that once
again some have dreamt too big and left another historic
note on how the world 'tried' once again to eradicate
malaria.
