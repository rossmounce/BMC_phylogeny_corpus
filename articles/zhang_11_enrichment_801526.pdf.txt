Enrichment of a microbial community performing
anaerobic oxidation of methane in a continuous
high-pressure bioreactor

Abstract
Background: Anaerobic oxidation of methane coupled to sulphate reduction (SR-AOM) prevents more than 90%
of the oceanic methane emission to the atmosphere. In a previous study, we demonstrated that the high methane
pressure (1, 4.5, and 8 MPa) stimulated in vitro SR-AOM activity. However, the information on the effect of highpressure on the microbial community structure and architecture was still lacking.
Results: In this study we analysed the long-term enrichment (286 days) of this microbial community, which was
mediating SR-AOM in a continuous high-pressure bioreactor. 99.7% of the total biovolume represented cells in the
form of small aggregates (diameter less then 15 μm). An increase of the total biovolume was observed (2.5 times).
After 286 days, the ANME-2 (anaerobic methanotrophic archaea subgroup 2) and SRB (sulphate reducing bacteria)
increased with a factor 12.5 and 8.4, respectively.
Conclusion: This paper reports a net biomass growth of communities involved in SR-AOM, incubated at highpressure.

Background
Anaerobic oxidation of methane coupled to sulphate
reduction (SR-AOM) is a major process determining
deep-sea geochemistry and cold-seep ecosystems. First
of all, it controls the atmospheric methane efflux from
the ocean floor, consuming more than 90% of the
methane produced in marine sediments [1]. Moreover,
it fuels the deep sea ecosystem by channelling thermal
generated and biogenetic methane into organic matter
and carbonate. Finally, SR-AOM shapes the sea
floor landscape by contributing to bicarbonate and
alkalinity production, resulting in massive carbonate
precipitation [2]. The overall SR-AOM reaction
is: CH4 + SO4 2− = HCO3 − + HS− + H2 O
G∅ = −16.5kJ/mol
Two groups of microorganisms are the key players in
SR-AOM process: anaerobic methanotrophic archaea
(ANME) with three groups (ANME-1, ANME-2 and
ANME-3) and sulphate reducing bacteria (SRB) [3-6].
All ANME groups discovered so far are related clades of

methanogens, while their SRB partner was always found
in the same environment with or without forming spatial closely related consortia [7]. However, neither
ANME nor SRB from SR-AOM active spots has been
obtained in pure culture yet. The main difficulty lies on
the extremely long doubling time (several months) and
low growth yield (0.05 g dry weight/g carbon oxidized)
of ANME and SRB from in vitro incubations [8-10].
To stimulate the in vitro SR-AOM activity and to
enrich the SR-AOM community, different types of bioreactors, which can be operated at ambient/high pressure
in continuous/batch mode, have been developed by different research groups [10-14]. Due to the extremely
low affinity for methane (K m of 37 mM) and the low
methane solubility at ambient pressure, high-pressure
bioreactors have the advantage of permitting a higher
SR-AOM activity [11,15]. Nevertheless, it is still
unknown if the high-pressure bioreactor also confers
advantage on biomass enrichment, and if it has an effect
on selective enrichment of certain groups of ANME.
Moreover, the information is lacking on the community
architecture inside the high-pressure bioreactor, meaning if the microbes live as single cells or form consortia.

Through high-pressure incubation, we have obtained
an enrichment originating from a Mud Volcano from the
Gulf of Cadiz, performing anaerobic oxidation of
methane. The SR-AOM activities at different incubation
conditions have been described previously [11]. In this
study, the community structure and architecture of this
enrichment were investigated. The potential growth of
ANME and SRB under high pressure has been evaluated.

Results and Discussion

Cell aggregates accounted for the major part of the
biovolume (Figure 1B). The middle size aggregates (Ø =
6, 7, 8, 9, 10 μm) contributed for about half of the total
biovolume (52.73 ± 9.04% in S1 and 47.02 ± 8.67% in
S2). Although the big size aggregates (Ø = 11, 12, 13,
14, 15 μm) had very low concentrations (2.22 ± 0.74
*105/ml slurry in S1 and 4.93 ± 1.56 *105/ml slurry as
shown in Figure 1A), they also contributed for large
part of the biovolume (26.67 ± 7.83% in S1 and 33.34 ±
8.54% in S2).

Community architectural distribution

To access the community architectural distribution, a
DAPI (4’, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining was
applied on the samples S1 (before high-pressure incubation) and S2 (after 286 days high-pressure incubation).
Based on DAPI staining cell counts, both single cells
and aggregates were commonly observed in S1 and S2.
The aggregates had different sizes ranging from 2 to 15
μm in diameter (Ø). In both S1 and S2 single cells were
1-2 orders more abundant than the aggregates (Figure
1A). Among all the aggregates, the ones with diameter
from 2 to 5 μm were the most abundant ones (73.35 ±
2.63% in S1 and 73.28 ± 1.75% in S2). Few spherical
aggregates bigger than 15 μm were observed in S1 or S2
(less then 4 × 104 aggregates/ml slurry). For some aggregates we observed that it was dividing into two smaller
spherical aggregates in both S1 and S2 (data not
shown). This was also reported in another enrichment
from a semi-continuous bioreactor operated under 1.4
MPa methane pressure [9]. It is an indication that these
large aggregates may have reached a “critical size” during growth, which then may disintegrate into smaller
aggregates for further growth.

Enrichment of total biomass

The total biovolume concentration increased from (1.28
± 0.06)*10 9 μm 3 /ml slurry in S1 to (4.49 ± 0.51)*10 9
μm 3 /ml slurry in S2 (Figure 1B). Since the reactor
volume was fixed and the biomass washing out during
reactor operation was negligible [11], the total biomass
inside the reactor increased 2.5 times within 286 days.
This reactor system was the first system that was able to
accumulate total biomass while maintaining high SRAOM activity–0.5 mmol sulfide production per day
while the reactor was operated at batch mode under 8
MPa methane pressure [11]. In the systems previously
reported by other authors, either only specific groups
but not the total biomass was quantified [16] or there
was major loss of biomass due to sampling and decay
[9,10].
The biovolume data was converted into cell dry
weight for a comparison with VSS (Volatile Suspended
Solids) data. Taken the same assumption as described
by Nauhaus et al. [9], there was about 0.2 g cell dry
weight/ml biovolume in the sediment sample with SRAOM activity. Therefore the biomass concentration in

Zhang et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:137

Page 3 of 8

the high-pressure bioreactor increased from 0.3 (g cell
dry weight/l slurry) in S1 to 0.9 (g cell dry weight/l
slurry) in S2. However, this value was one order lower
compared to the 8 g/l of VSS (based on weight difference between drying sample at 105°C and at 650°C) as
reported by Zhang et al. [11]. One possibility is that the
assumption 0.2 g cell dry weight/ml biovolume was
based on analysis of two strains of small marine microorganism [9,17], which could be not representative of
the cells enriched in the reactor. Another possibility
would be the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS)
contributed large part of VSS. For example, for granular
microbial aggregates enriched in an OLAND (oxygenlimited autotrophic nitrification-denitrification) reactor,
as much as 50-80% of the space occupied by bacteria
was constituted of EPS [18]. For the deep-sea sediment,
the presence of EPS has been reported both from in situ
sediment and in vitro enrichments at different locations
[9,19]. However whether the production of EPS was stimulated during high-pressure incubations and what was
the mechanism behind still needs to be further
investigated.
Community structure

To identify the cells and aggregates observed under
microscope, catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence
in situ hybridization (CARD-FISH) with probes on
ANME-1, 2, 3 and SRB (Table 1) was applied on S1 and
S2. Based on CARD-FISH counts, ANME-2 and SRB
were the most abundant ones compared to other types
of ANME, especially in the form of aggregates. Among
the free-living cells, only less than 10% belonged to
ANME-2 or SRB (Table 2). The number of ANME-2
aggregates accounted for 37.1 ± 6.2% of the total

aggregates in S1 and 47.2 ± 8.2% in S2, while SRB
accounted for 32.0 ± 6.2% of the total aggregates in S1
and 37.6 ± 5.0% in S2. However, it has to be taken into
account that the CARD-FISH in this study was performed with single probe hybridization. Aggregates with
ANME-2 are most probably also containing SRB as well,
because they tend to live closely and form consortia
[7,9]. No ANME-1 was detected in S1 and S2. About 2%
of ANME-3 was detected in the aggregates (Table 2).
The CARD-FISH result showed that a large part of
biomass in S1 and S2, especially single cells, did not
belong to ANME or SRB. There was growth of other
unknown microbes within a mixed community of
ANME/SRB. Therefore a clone library analysis was performed on S2 to approach to the complete archaeal and
bacterial communities. Archaeal community had extremely low diversity, where ANME-2a and MBG-D (marine benthic group D) were the only two groups of
archaea detected. ANME-2a was the dominant, which
accounted for 88% of the archaeal community (Figure
2). No 16S rRNA gene from ANME-3 was detected.
The absence of ANME-3 in the archaeal clone library
was contradictory to CARD-FISH result. The size of the
clone library was not large enough to detect the rare
ANME-3 or the hybridization experiment may have led
to mis-hybridization, thus giving false positive signal.
Dissimilar from archaeal community, the bacterial community was highly diverse (Figure 3). Gammaproteobacteria (43%) were the most dominant followed by the
Deltaproteobacteria (17%), which includes the SRB.
Among total bacteria population in S2, 8% was belonging to SEEP-SRB1a subgroup of Deltaproteobacteria,
which were found to be specifically associated with
ANME-2a in other enrichments mediating SR-AOM
process [20]. Most of the Gammaproteobacteria found
in the community were closely related to Methylophaga
sp. and Methylobacter sp., which are known to use
reduced one-carbon compounds, such as methane,
methanol or dimethylsulphide [21]. The presence of
such bacteria in our anaerobic reactor is intriguing since
methane and sulphate were the only electron donor and
acceptor supplied. The presence and even production of
sulphide (sulphide concentration increased up to 0.5
mM everyday in the reactor) was an indication of anaerobic condition inside the reactor. However we cannot
exclude the possibility of a limited amount of dissolved
oxygen in the reactor influent, which could explain the
presence of aerobic. Further tests need to show if these
Gammaproteobacteria are playing an important active
role in the reactor.

(Table 2). By combining with the total biovolume data
from DAPI staining (Figure 1B), the biovolume of
ANME-2 in S1 was:
(1.28*10 9 μm 3 /ml slurry) * 13.4% = 1.7*10 8 μm 3 /ml
slurry
The biovolume of ANME-2 in S2 was:

Figure 1 Numbers of cells and aggregates (A) and the
biovolume of cells and aggregates (B) in S1 and S2. The
average value and standard error were calculated from 4 individual
staining for each sample. For each staining 50 fields of view were
counted for calculation. Note that the y axe scale is different for
single cells.

Therefore after 286 days incubation, the ANME-2
population increased for 12.5 times. Following the same
method of calculation, the SRB population increased for
8.4 times after 286 days incubation in this high-pressure
bioreactor. The populations of ANME-2 and SRB both
increased faster than the total biomass, which indicated
that ANME-2 and SRB were selectively enriched in the
system. This selective enrichment of ANME-2 and SRB
was another proof that the incubation condition inside
this high-pressure bioreactor was favourable for SRAOM community.
To our knowledge, this is the first report on the
enrichment of SR-AOM community under high
methane pressure, although potential growth of ANME1, ANME-2 and SRB has been reported in other engineered systems at ambient or low methane pressures
(Table 3). The different inocula showed different doubling times. When ANME-1 and ANME-2c were incubated in continuous flow bioreactors under ambient
methane partial pressure, ANME-1 had doubling time
of 1.1 months while ANME-2c had doubling time of 1.4
months [16]. High methane partial pressure appeared to
have advantage on stimulating the growth of ANME. In
the experiment of Krüger et al. [22], the methanedependent uptake of 15 N-NH 4 by AOM community
dominated by ANME-1 was higher at 1.5 MPa methane
pressure than at ambient methane pressure. If we
assume the ANME-2a cells in our system were following
a logarithmic growth curve, a doubling time of 2.5
months can be estimated based on ANME-2 biovolume
in S1 and S2, which is shorter than the result (3.8
months of doubling time of ANME-2a from an ambient
pressure bioreactor) obtained by Meulepas et al. [10].
The increase of energy gained from SR-AOM process
by increasing methane pressure may favour the biomass
growth [8,22]. Continuous flow also stimulated growth:
ANME-2a/2c had longer doubling time in a fed-batch
bioreactor (7.5 months) than in continuous flow bioreactors (1.4-3.8 months) (Table 3).

Conclusions
After 286 days incubation in a simulated cold seep
environment under high methane pressure, ANME-2
and SRB in the sediment from Captain Arutyunov Mud
Volcano were enriched. Based on biovolume calculation,

sequences.

the populations of ANME-2 and SRB increased for 12.5
times and 8.4 times. Within total biomass volume,
99.7% was accounted from aggregates. Therefore the
incubation condition apparently favoured the cells to
form aggregates, especially in small size (2<Ø≤5 μm),
rather than to live as single cells. No aggregate bigger
than 15 μm in diameter was observed; they apparently
divided after reaching a critical size. Based on the 16S
rRNA gene clone library, the archaeal diversity was low,
and contained only ANME-2 (88%) and MBG-D (12%).
In contrast, the bacterial community was highly diverse.

Methods
Incubation condition

In a previous study, the sediment sample originally from
Captain Arutyunov Mud Volcano (Gulf of Cadiz, North
East Atlantic) was diluted 12 times with artificial sea
water medium and incubated in a continuous high-pressure bioreactor at 15°C [11]. This bioreactor system was
a simulator for cold seep ecosystems, where sulphate
and high-pressure methane were supplied. Because the
high apparent affinity for methane (37 mM) in SR-AOM
reaction and low dissolubility of methane in seawater
(1.3 mM at 15°C at ambient pressure), it is necessary to
supply high pressure methane to obtain high concentration of dissolved methane which can be directly used by

microorganisms for high in vitro SR-AOM activity [11].
During this research, the reactor was operated in a fedbatch mode or a continuous mode. When it was in fedbatch mode, the methane pressures were switched
between 1, 4.5 and 8 MPa. When it was in continuous
mode, the methane pressure was either 1 or 8 MPa and
the flow rate was 0.1 ml/min (HRT 100 hours). The SRAOM activities under different operational conditions
have been described previously [11]. To take a slurry
sample, the incubation vessel was open under a nitrogen
atmosphere and manually stirred to make the slurry
sample homogeneous. The slurry samples before (S1)
and after (S2) 286 days incubation were fixed in 4% formaldehyde and stored at 4°C for cell staining. Additional
slurry from S2 was stored at -20°C for DNA extraction
and clone library analysis.
Cell and aggregates quantification

To assess the number and the size of cells and aggregates, DAPI (4’, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining
was performed on S1 (after 2000 times dilution) and S2
(after 5600 times dilution). Subsequently, the samples
were filtrated onto a circular GTTP polycarbonate filter
(0.2 μm, Millipore, Germany) with a diameter of 2.5 cm.
The number of cells (or aggregates) was quantified
under a microscope (Zeiss, Carl Zeiss Microimaging

GmbH, Germany) at 1,000 times magnification. The diameter of a single cell was assumed as 0.45 μm, which is
the average size of ANME and SRB cells [3,9]. The diameters of the aggregates were measured according to a
reference scale bar built in the eyepiece of the

microscope. The biovolume was calculated assuming
that both cells and aggregates have spherical shapes. For
each sample, 4 individual staining were applied. For
each staining 50 fields of view were counted for
calculation.

Cell and aggregates identification

In order to evaluate which type of ANME and SRB were
present and enriched in the reactor, catalyzed reporter
deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization (CARDFISH) was applied on S1 and S2. The slurry samples
were embedded onto GTTP filters. The filters were
incubated in methanol with 0.15% H2O2 for 30 min at
room temperature before washed with water and ethanol and dried. For each sample, 2 filters were prepared.
One was incubated in lysozyme solution (10 mg/ml in
0.05 M EDTA, pH 8.0; 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) for 15
min at 37°C to achieve permeablilization of bacterial
cells, and another one was incubated in Proteinase K
solution (15 μg/ml in MilliQ water) for 3 min at room
temperature to achieve permeabilization of achaeal cells.
Afterwards the filters were cut into 4 pieces. Each piece
was for hybridization with one probe (Table 1). The
hybridization was performed according to the protocol
previously described [23]. After hybridization, the filter
was stained with DAPI to target all cells present on the
filter.
During CARD-FISH, a few steps of washing the filter
may cause the loss of cells and aggregates. It was
assumed that all types of cells or aggregates were
washed out in the same ratio. Therefore the percentage
of ANME or SRB among the total cells did not change
after washing. For each hybridization, cells and aggregates in 50 fields of view were analyzed under microscope. For each field, both probe staining and DAPI
staining were counted to quantify the concentration of
ANME-1 (or ANME-2, ANME-3 and SRB) among total
biomass.
For a more detailed investigation on the microbial
community, the archaeal and bacterial 16S rRNA gene
clone libraries were performed on S2 according to protocol previously described [24,25] with the primers
listed in Table 1. For archaeal library, 56 clones were
obtained while 50 clones were randomly picked for
sequencing. For bacterial library, 110 clones were
obtained while 100 clones were picked for sequencing.
The sequences were compared with their best match
in NCBI to classify their phylogenetic group (Additional file 1, Table S1). To calculate the percentage of
each phylogenetic group into total archaeal/bacterial
community, the number of clones within one phylogenetic group was divided by the number of sequenced
clones within archaeal/bacterial library. All the
sequences described in the paper have been deposited
in the databases of GenBank, under accession numbers
HQ405602 to HQ405741. The archaeal hpylogenetic
tree has been constructed by Maximum Likelihood
based on 212 sequences using the online RaxML tool
at http://phylobench.vital-it.ch/raxml-bb/index.php[26].
