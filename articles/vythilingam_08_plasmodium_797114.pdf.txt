Abstract
Background: Since a large focus of human infection with Plasmodium knowlesi, a simian malaria parasite
naturally found in long-tailed and pig tailed macaques, was reported in Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo, it was
pertinent to study the situation in peninsular Malaysia. A study was thus initiated to screen human cases
of Plasmodium malariae using molecular techniques, to determine the presence of P. knowlesi in non- human
primates and to elucidate its vectors.
Methods: Nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to identify all Plasmodium species present in
the human blood samples sent to the Parasitology laboratory of Institute for Medical Research. At the
same time, non-human primates were also screened for malaria parasites and nested PCR was carried out
to determine the presence of P. knowlesi. Mosquitoes were collected from Pahang by human landing
collection and monkey-baited-traps situated on three different levels. All mosquitoes were identified and
salivary glands and midguts of anopheline mosquitoes were dissected to determine the presence of malaria
parasites and nested PCR was carried out on positive glands. Sequencing of the csp genes were carried on
P. knowlesi samples from humans, monkeys and mosquitoes, positive by PCR.
Results and Discussion: Plasmodium knowlesi was detected in 77 (69.37%) of the 111 human samples, 10
(6.90%) of the 145 monkey blood and in 2 (1.7%) Anopheles cracens. Sequence of the csp gene clustered
with other P. knowlesi isolates.
Conclusion: Human infection with Plasmodium knowlesi is occurring in most states of peninsular Malaysia.
An. cracens is the main vector. Economic exploitation of the forest is perhaps bringing monkeys,
mosquitoes and humans into increased contact. A single bite from a mosquito infected with P. knowlesi is
sufficient to introduce the parasite to humans. Thus, this zoonotic transmission has to be considered in
the future planning of malaria control.

Background
The burden of malaria in many parts of peninsular Malaysia has decreased substantially due to malaria control
activities. The reported incidence of malaria in Malaysia
has decreased to 5,294 cases in 2006 compared to 12,705
cases in 2000. In 2006 there were only 852 cases in peninsular Malaysia compared with 3918 cases in 2000
(Annual Report, Ministry of Health Malaysia). However, a
fifth species, Plasmodium knowlesi that was originally
described as a malaria parasite of the long-tailed macaque
monkeys [1] is now occurring here. The first case was
reported in peninsular Malaysia in 1965 [2]. However,
since 2004 there have been reports of P. knowlesi infecting
humans in the Southeast Asia region [3-8].
The accidental discovery that Plasmodium cynomolgi could
be transmitted to humans via mosquito bites in the laboratory [9] stimulated great interest and thus, extensive
studies were carried out in peninsular Malaysia to determine the distribution, prevalence and species of malaria
parasites in monkeys and apes and the vectors of monkey
malaria in nature and to determine whether monkey
malaria infection transmissible to man existed in Malaya
[10-14]. From their studies, several new species of simian
malaria parasites were described [15-17].
After the first human case of P. knowlesi, a study that was
initiated in the state of Pahang to investigate whether
malaria was a zoonosis, concluded that simian malaria in
humans was an extremely rare event [18,19]. This was
based on studies in which blood samples were collected
from more than 1100 local residents, the samples were
pooled and injected them into rhesus monkeys. However,
none of the monkeys contracted malaria.
In most instances, infection of the human host with the
malaria parasite begins with the bite of an infected Anopheles mosquito that inoculates sporozoites into the host. In
the early works carried out on the vectors of simian
malaria in peninsular Malaysia, it was postulated that
Anopheles leucosphyrus complex are involved in simian
malaria transmission. In a study conducted in the coastal
area of Selangor in peninsular Malaysia, Anopheles hackeri
was incriminated as a vector of P.knowlesi [10]. In the
inland hill forest area of Selangor, (Hlu Lui) a simian parasite, Plasmodium inui was isolated from Anopheles latens
(= An. leucosphyrus) [11]. A year later in 1963 Plasmodium
cynomolgi was isolated from Anopheles introlatus (= An. balabacensis introlatus) [12]. In the monsoon rain forest of
northern Malaysia in the state of Perlis An. cracens (= An.
balabacensis balabacensis) was the vector of both P. inui and
P. cynomolgi [13].
In 2004, a large focus of human P. knowlesi infection was
reported in the Kapit Division of Sarawak [3]. Thus, it was

http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/1/1/26

pertinent to deduce if knowlesi malaria was currently
occurring in peninsular Malaysia and to elucidate the vectors and to study the parasites in macaques in the areas
around human cases. This paper reports the preliminary
results of the study.

Methods
Human blood samples
Blood samples or Giemsa stained blood films were sent to
the Parasitology Unit of the Institute from hospitals and
health centres that wanted a confirmation of Plasmodium
malariae or in some cases to rule out P. knowlesi.
DNA extraction from whole blood
DNA was extracted from whole blood using the Qiagen D
Neasy Blood Tissue Kit (Hilden, Germany), following the
manufacturer's recommendations.
DNA extraction from blood films
In some cases only Giemsa stained blood films were provided. Before the extraction of the DNA, the slides were
first cleaned with chloroform to remove oil. Fifty microliters of TE buffer was then pipetted on to the thin blood
film. Two discs were punched out from a Whatman 1 filter
paper (Whatman USA) using a pre flamed paper puncher.
The discs were placed on the slide to soak up the buffer.
Using a clean, flamed forceps, at least half of the smear
was completely wiped off the slide with the filter paper
and was transferred to 1.5 ml centrifuge tubes (Axygen).
The DNA was extracted using the Qiagen D Neasy Blood
Tissue Kit (Hilden, Germany).
Nested Polymerase Chain Reaction
Nested PCR assays [3,20], based on the Plasmodium DNA
sequence of the small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSUrRNA)
genes, were used to detect and identify the species of
malaria parasites found in the blood. The maximum
number of samples processed at any one time was not
more than 10. Positive controls for P. falciparum, P. knowlesi, P. malariae and P. vivax were included for all nested
PCR species assays. A negative control was also included
for each batch of assays. Nest 1 reaction was carried out in
a 50 μl reaction mixture containing 1× reaction buffer (5×
Green Go Taq Flexi Buffer, Promega Madison USA) 3 mM
MgCl2(Promega), 200 mM of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate (Promega), 300 nM of each primers and 1.25
U of Go Taq DNA polymerase (Promega) and 5 μl of DNA
template was used for each reaction.

Nest 2 PCR amplification was done in a 20 μl reaction
mixture containing 1× reaction buffer (5× Green Go Taq
Flexi Buffer Promega) 2 mM MgCl2(Promega,), 200 mM
of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate (Promega,), 300
nM of each primers and 0.5 U Go Taq DNA polymerase
(Promega,) and 2 μl of the nest 1 PCR products were used

as DNA templates. All PCR reactions were carried out
using thermal cycler (Techne TC 152 -Barloworld Sci Ltd
UK). Ten microliters of the nest 2 amplicons were analyzed by agarose gel.
Sequencing of the Plasmodium csp genes
The csp genes of malaria parasites from all human isolates
positive for P. knowlesi were amplified with primers,
PKCSP-F and PKCSP-R [3]. However, for the mosquito
and monkey isolates, primers PKCSPF2 (5' TACAAGAACAAGATGARGAAC
3')
and
PKCSPR2
(5'
TCAGCTACTTAATTGAATAATGC 3') were used since
many non- specific bands were obtained with PKCSP-F
and PKCSP-R.

PCR was carried out in a 20 μl reaction volume containing
1× Phusion HF buffer (Finnzymes), 200 mM/l of each
dNTP (Finnzymes Finland) and 250 nM/l of each primer,
and 0.02 U of Phusion DNA Polymerase (Finnzymes Finland). The PCR was carried out using a thermal cycler
(Techne TC 152 -Barloworld Sci Ltd UK). The PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 98°C for 30
sec followed by 40 cycles of amplification at 94°C for 7
sec, 51°C for 20 sec, 72°C for 20 sec followed by a final
extension step of 10 min. The expected size of the PCR
products is approximately 1.2 kb and amplicons from
each isolate were excised from the gel and purified using
Perfectprep gel cleanup kit (Eppendorf, Germany), following the manufacturer's recommendation. The purified
products were cloned as previously described [3]. At least
20 of transformants from each PCR were screened using
the csp primers mentioned above. Amplification was done
in a 20 μl reaction mixtures containing 1× reaction buffer
(5× Green Go Taq Flexi Buffer, Promega Madison USA) 2
mM MgCl2(Promega), 200 mM of each deoxynucleoside
triphosphate (Promega), 300 nM of each primers and 0.5
U Go Taq DNA polymerase (Promega,). PCR conditions
were as follows: initial denaturation of 94°C for 10 min
followed by 30 cycles of amplification at 94°C at 1 min,
annealing at 53°C at 1 min, extension at 72°C for 1 min
20 sec, followed by a final extension step at 72°C at 5
min. Ten microliters of the amplicons were digested with
EcoR1 (Promega) and analyzed by gel electrophoresis.
Plasmids from clones having the correct inserts were
extracted using S.N.A.P. plasmid extraction kit (Invitrogen, USA) following the manufacturer's protocol. Purified
plasmids was sent to Solgent Company Limited (Daejeon,
South Korea) for sequencing to obtain the entire csp gene
sequence of P. knowlesi
Analysis of sequence data
Analysis of the csp genes was performed as previously
described [3]. Sequences of the 456 nucleotide that
encodes non – repeat N- terminal (first 195 nucleotides of
coding sequence) and C- terminal (the last 261 nucle-

http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/1/1/26

otides of the csp gene coding sequence) region of the protein were aligned by CLUSTAL W using Megalign
(Lasergene, DNASTAR, USA). Regions of the protein were
aligned using Megalign software (Lasergene). The csp gene
sequences from patients, mosquitoes and monkey samples were compared with those obtained from the GenBank data base. Phylogenetic trees were performed by the
neighbour-joining (NJ) [21] and Bayesian methods [22].
The NJ method was analyzed using the Kimura-2 parameter with 1000 bootstrap replicates and was carried out
using the MEGA version 4.0 software [23]. On the other
hand, the Bayesian method was analysed using the Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano (HKY) model with the following
parameters: the search was performed at 1,000,000 generations, sampling every 100 generations and the first 2000
trees were discarded in the burn-ins. The analysis was carried using the Mr. Bayes 3.1 software [24].
Nucleotide sequences reported in this study have been
deposited in Gen Bank under accession numbers:
EU687467–EU687470, EU708437 (human samples),
EU821335 (mosquito sample), EU821336 (monkey sample). The other malaria csp gene sequences used were
obtained from GenBank: P. knowlesi (M11031), P. knowlesi (K0082), KH35 (AH013332), KH43 (AH013333),
KH50 (AH013334), KH107 (AH013336), KH115
(AH013337), P. coatneyi (AY135360), P. cynomolgi
(M15104), P. simiovale (U09765), P. simium (L05068), P.
inui (FJ009512) P. vivax (M34697), P. malariae (U09766),
P. malariae (J03992), P. falciparum (K02194) and P.
vinckei lentum (AF162331).
Trapping of monkeys
Monkeys were trapped in the vicinity of Kuala Lumpur,
Selangor State and Kuala Lipis in Pahang State with help
from the wild-life department. The captured monkeys
were anesthetized by intramuscular injection with ketamine hydrochloride. Ten ml blood was collected, after
which the monkeys were tagged with an electronic identification system (Trovan Ltd London). After they recovered
they were released into the deep forest.
Preparation of blood films
Both thick and thin blood films were prepared followed
by staining with Giemsa. Microscopic examinations were
carried out using compound microscope under oil
immersion under 100× magnification.
DNA extraction from whole blood, PCR and sequencing
DNA was extracted from the whole blood using the
Dneasy Tissue Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Germany) following the manufacturer's recommendation. All monkeys
were screened for malaria parasites using primers rPLU3
and rPLU4 [20], and for P. knowlesi using the primers
Pmk8 and Pmk9 [3]. Nested PCR, cloning and sequencing

of all samples positive for P. knowlesi were performed as
described above.
Study Sites for mosquito collection
The study site for mosquito collection was in Kuala Lipis
district in the State of Pahang. Pre-surveys for mosquito
collections were carried out to determine suitable sites for
long term study based on presence of monkeys and occurrence of cases. Based, on pre-surveys two sites were
selected for the study. One is Serunai Mela village [4°
7.0'N, 102° 11.9'E ] and the other is a fruit farm in Sungai
Ular [4° 15.7'N, 102°4.8'E ]. In Serunai Mela, a case of P.
knowlesi had occurred and the case house is situated at the
forest fringe. Sungai Ular was selected as a patient had
reported that he visited the farm before falling ill and it
was also frequented by monkeys
Mosquito collections
All night mosquito collections using bare-leg catch
method [25] were performed from July 2007 to November 2007. In each area 4 nights of collection were carried
out every month by three men working outdoors from
18.00 to 06.00 hours.
Monkey-baited-trap
In order to compare the number of mosquitoes attracted
to humans and monkeys, a monkey- baited – trap was
constructed in Serunai Mela Village as previously
described [26,27].
Mosquito identification and dissection
All mosquitoes were identified morphologically in the
field laboratory. The keys of Reid [28] were used for the
identification of Anopheles mosquitoes and keys of Sallum
[29] were used for leucosphyrus group in particular. Anopheles mosquitoes were dissected to extract ovaries to determine parity and the midguts and salivary glands were
examined for oocysts and sporozoites, respectively. All the
positive salivary glands were placed in 1.5 microcentrifuge
tubes (Axygen, USA) containing absolute alcohol and
were labeled accordingly.
DNA extraction, PCR and sequencing
Ethanol used in the preservation of the salivary glands
were allowed to evaporate completely by placing the tubes
in a Thermomixer (Eppendorf, Germany) set at 70°C.
DNA was then extracted using the Qiagen D Neasy Blood
Tissue Kit (Hilden, Germany) as described above. PCR
and sequencing were also carried out as mentioned above.
Ethical clearance
This project was approved by the Institute for Medical
Research & Ethical Committee Ministry of Health Malaysia and the Animal Use Committee of the Institute.

Results
Humans
A total of 111 samples were received for PCR (from July
2005–March 2008). Of these 77 (69.37%) were positive
for P. knowlesi (Table 1). By microscopy, 93 (83.78%) of
the slides were reported as P. malariae of which by nested
PCR 62 (55.86%) were positive for P. knowlesi and 11
(9.91%) were mixed infection with P. knowlesi and other
human malaria parasites (Table 1). Positive P. knowlesi
cases were observed in all states in peninsular Malaysia
with the exception of four – Johore, Negeri Sembilan, Perlis and Terengganu (Fig. 1). Pahang has the highest
number of P. knowlesi cases (50.65%).
Monkeys
Until December 2007 a total of 145 monkeys had been
trapped. Of these 143 (98.62%) were Macaca fascicularis
and one (0.69%) each of M. nemestrina and Presbytis melalophos. Seventy five of the monkeys were trapped from
Kuala Lipis and of these 73 (97.33%) were positive for
malaria parasites by microscopy and 10 were positive for
P. knowlesi by PCR. In Kuala Lumpur, 2 (6.90%)were positive for malaria parasites out of the 29 that were trapped
but none was positive for P. knowlesi. In Selangor, all 41
monkeys examined were negative.
Mosquitoes
A total of 339 Anopheles mosquitoes belonging to 12 species were caught biting humans and monkeys in the five
months period as shown in Table 2. Anopheles cracens was
the predominant mosquito comprising 62.2% of the total
collection. This was followed by Anopheles maculatus. The
two species attracted to monkeys were An. cracens and
Anopheles kochi.
Sporozoite rate
A total of two An. cracens were positive for sporozoites
from Serunai Mela of which one was positive for oocyst as
well. Thus, the sporozoite rate in Serunai Mela was 1.7.
PCR results found them to be positive for P. knowlesi and
this was confirmed by the sequencing of the CSP gene.
Biting cycles
Anopheles cracens were early biters coming to bite man as
early as 19.00 hours and the peak biting time was 19.00 to
21.00 hours. In the forest, the biting was reduced after
22.00 hours but in the fruit orchard they continued to bite
throughout the night.
Sequencing analysis of the csp genes
The csp genes of malaria parasites, from P. knowlesi-positive isolates, were successfully amplified, cloned and
sequenced. The size of the PCR product ranges from 1050
to1128 bp. Phylogenetic analysis inferred from the NJ
method (Figure 2) showed that malaria parasites isolated

from these samples clustered with the reference P. knowlesi
obtained from Gen bank and with those reported by others [3]. When the flanking regions of the csp genes, from
isolates obtained in this study, were compared with the
reference P. knowlesi Nuri strain (M11031), the pairwise
identity ranges from 97.1% to 99.6% (data not shown).
Furthermore, a clone from a mosquito isolate shared an
identical sequence with KH115, which was isolated in
Sarawak, East Malaysia. The topology obtained using the
Bayesian method (Fig 3) is comparable to the NJ tree,
which strongly supports the results obtained using the NJ
method.

Discussion
From these preliminary data it is evident that the fifth
human malaria parasite P. knowlesi is present in most
states of peninsular Malaysia. With better molecular diagnostic techniques one can differentiate between P. knowlesi and P. malariae. The extent of the problem would
depend on the cohabitation of humans, non-human primates and the presence of the potential vectors, which are
simio-anthropophagic as shown in this study. In a laboratory setting it has been shown that P. knowlesi was transmitted by mosquito bites from monkey to monkey, from
monkey to humans, from human to human and from

human back to monkeys [30]. At that time it was postulated that when human malaria cases reaches a low level,
the possibility of reseeding the human population with
simian malaria parasites could be highly significant [30].
This perhaps is due to the declining anti-plasmodial
immunity in humans leading to increased susceptibility
to simian parasites. Most of these cases are occurring in
malaria-free areas which are not subject to control activities. There have also been reports of mortality associated
with knowlesi malaria infection in humans [6]. This
shows that simian malaria could pose a serious problem
to public health.

study showed that An. cracens, an important vector of
human malaria, was also positive for P. inui, another simian malaria [31]. This mosquito was found feeding on
monkeys at the canopy and humans on the ground [31].
In Malaysia, An. cracens was first reported in Perlis, the
Northern most state bordering Thailand and a later study
showed that it was also present in the state of Terengganu
[13,29]. This is the first report of the presence An. cracens
in Kuala Lipis, Pahang and it has now been incriminated
as the vector of P. knowlesi. Both positive mosquitoes had
more than 1,000 sporozoites showing that they are efficient vectors.

This study has shown that there is a link between An. cracens, humans and monkeys. Human cases of P. knowlesi
are occurring in areas purportedly free from the four
human malarias, but where An. cracens is found and
where monkeys are positive for P. knowlesi. A previous

Anopheles maculatus is the most important vector of
human malaria in peninsular Malaysia [28]. It has been
shown to be susceptible to simian malaria in the laboratory [32,33] and coming to monkey bait in the canopy
[15,25]. However, in our study areas An. maculatus has
been found only in small numbers biting humans and
none in a monkey- bait-trap.

Earlier workers in Malaysia [15] felt strongly that simian
malaria will not be easily transmitted to humans. They
must have based their conclusions on the fact that in the
coastal areas, where monkeys were heavily infected with
P. knowlesi, the vector An. hackeri was highly zoophilic. In
the same area, they dissected An. lesteri which was found
feeding on humans and macaques but were negative by
dissection although the macaques were heavily infected.
Based on these findings, the chances of humans being
infected with simian malaria were deemed remote. In the
early days, perhaps the monkeys were not living in close
association with humans. Currently with development
and deforestation the macaques have come close to
human habitation and those in the semi-urban areas were
positive for malaria parasites.

Long-tailed macaques are also found in close association
with humans in the urban areas but fortunately those
found in the urban areas are free of malaria parasites. This
could be due to the absence of competent vectors that
could transmit malaria parasites.
The rain forests of Southeast Asia occupy hilly areas over
parts of Indochina, Thailand, Myanmar, Indonesia and

the Philippines and in most of these areas human cases of
P. knowlesi have been reported [4,5,8]. Natural hosts of P.
knowlesi such as the long and pig-tailed macaques abound
in this region and so does the An. leucosphyrus group of
mosquitoes. Thus, in the future it will be of no surprise if
more human cases of P. knowlesi malaria are reported in
these areas, contrary to what was perceived by the earlier
scientists.

Phylogenetic tree based on the non-repeat region of the circumsporozoite (csp) genes of malaria parasites
produced by the Bayesian method. Figures on the branches are the posterior probabilities from the Bayesian analysis.

In Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo, An. latens has been incriminated as the vector [34] and the biting ratio of monkey to
human was 1:1.3 (25). While An. cracens biting ratio of
monkey to humans was 1: 5.6. This shows that An. cracens
prefer to bite humans compared to monkeys, and could
probably explain for fewer cases in peninsular Malaysia.
Anopheles kochi was found biting monkeys in monkey-

baited traps but was not found biting humans. Thus, the
possibility is there for it to maintain the infection in the
natural hosts.
From the current study, ninety seven percent of the
macaques from Kuala Lipis were positive for malaria parasites and the presence of vectors in the area demonstrate

that simian malaria in humans may pose to be a public
health problem in the near future. Some human cases of
P. knowlesi in Kuala Lipis were infected in the vicinity of
their houses or in the fruit orchards. Sporadic collections
of mosquitoes in the case areas revealed the presence of
An. cracens and macaques were also sighted in those areas.
A recent study in Thailand [35] failed to detect P. knowlesi
in macaque populations in the area where the first case
was reported [4].

Conclusion
This study has established that An. cracens is the vector of
P. knowlesi in Kuala Lipis, Pahang and cases of P. knowlesi
have occurred in humans in areas where long tailed
macaques have also been found infected with P. knowlesi.
These findings are important for the planning and control
of malaria strategies in the future, especially in the elimination of malaria.
