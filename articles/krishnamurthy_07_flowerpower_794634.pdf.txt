Abstract
Background: Function prediction by transfer of annotation from the top database hit in a
homology search has been shown to be prone to systematic error. Phylogenomic analysis reduces
these errors by inferring protein function within the evolutionary context of the entire family.
However, accuracy of function prediction for multi-domain proteins depends on all members
having the same overall domain structure. By contrast, most common homolog detection methods
are optimized for retrieving local homologs, and do not address this requirement.
Results: We present FlowerPower, a novel clustering algorithm designed for the identification of
global homologs as a precursor to structural phylogenomic analysis. Similar to methods such as
PSIBLAST, FlowerPower employs an iterative approach to clustering sequences. However, rather
than using a single HMM or profile to expand the cluster, FlowerPower identifies subfamilies using
the SCI-PHY algorithm and then selects and aligns new homologs using subfamily hidden Markov
models. FlowerPower is shown to outperform BLAST, PSI-BLAST and the UCSC SAM-Target 2K
methods at discrimination between proteins in the same domain architecture class and those
having different overall domain structures.
Conclusion: Structural phylogenomic analysis enables biologists to avoid the systematic errors
associated with annotation transfer; clustering sequences based on sharing the same domain
architecture is a critical first step in this process. FlowerPower is shown to consistently identify
homologous sequences having the same domain architecture as the query.
Availability: FlowerPower is available as a webserver at http://phylogenomics.berkeley.edu/

Introduction
Biological processes such as speciation, gene duplication,
and domain shuffling produce families of related genes
whose gene products can have vastly different molecular

functions. Inference of protein function in these cases has
been shown to be prone to systematic error [1-3]. Phylogenomic analysis – inferring the function of a protein in the
larger context of a protein family based on evolutionary

relationships – addresses these errors and improves the
accuracy of functional classification [2,4]. In a phylogenomic approach, a phylogenetic tree is constructed from a
multiple alignment of evolutionarily related sequences.
The tree topology is analyzed to discriminate orthologs
from paralogs, and is overlaid with existing experimental
data for the members of the family. Functional inference
can then be performed in an evolutionary context.
Protein domains are independently folding structural
units that often confer specific functions. Roughly 65% of
eukaryotic proteins and 40% of prokaryotic proteins are
composed of multiple domains [5,6]. Domain fusion and
fission events produce "families" of proteins that may
share only a single domain in common, and some
domains are "promiscuous," in that they are present in
many different domain architectures. In automated functional inference approaches, these "local" (partial)
homologs are often retrieved using database search, and
may, in fact, be the top hits; they may also be placed as
siblings in a phylogenetic tree with proteins having
entirely different domain structures. Since the function of
a multi-domain protein is a composite of all its constituent domains, annotation transfer based on local homology – even in a phylogenomic context – can be
misleading. This issue has received less attention than differentiation of orthologs and paralogs, but is the source of
a significant number of annotation errors.
The most commonly used methods for clustering homologous proteins are BLAST [7] and PSI-BLAST [8]. There are
three primary problems with the use of these and similar
tools in the context of phylogenomic inference of molecular function. First, these methods are optimized for
homolog detection based on local similarity; clusters are
not screened to remove proteins with different domain
structure. Second, overly permissive parameterization of
these tools – particularly iterative methods such as PSIBLAST – can result in the inclusion of non-homologs.
Third, it is possible for repeated iterations of the homolog
identification process to result in profile drift, with the
result that the seed sequence may not be included in the
final cluster, or the profile may have drifted to include
non-homologs in the set.
Structural phylogenomics combines evolutionary and
structural analysis to elucidate changes in molecular function and structure in protein superfamilies. This approach
has several applications, one of which is predicting the
molecular function of unknown proteins in an evolutionary context. Phylogenomic inference has been shown to
reduce the systematic errors associated with function prediction by homology; integration of structural information (or prediction) improves the accuracy of this
approach. Our recommended protocol for protein func-

tion prediction integrates structural considerations in the
first step of a phylogenomic pipeline, i.e. gathering
homologs that share the same domain architecture. For
this task we present FlowerPower, a method that discriminates between local and global homologs with much
higher precision than BLAST, PSIBLAST and the UCSC
SAM Target-2K (T2K) hidden Markov model (HMM)
method [9]. We also present examples of sequence annotation errors detected through the use of structural phylogenomics, which could have been avoided at the outset
by adopting this approach.

Results and discussion
We compared FlowerPower, BLAST, PSI-BLAST and T2K
on the task of discriminating between proteins sharing the
same domain architecture (global homologs) and those
having local similarity but different overall domain structures (local homologs). BLAST and PSI-BLAST are the
most commonly used methods for clustering homologous sequences. The T2K method is less well known, but
has been shown to outperform all other methods at
remote homolog detection [10]. For these experiments,
we selected nine sequences whose domain structures
could be confidently predicted by PFAM [11]. Each
method was allowed to select sequences from the SwissPFAM database [12]. Method parameters were varied to
assess the impact on sensitivity (recall: fraction of global
homologs selected) and precision (selectivity: fraction of
selected sequences that were global homologs).
These experiments underscored the classic tradeoff
between sensitivity (or recall) and precision: restrictive
cutoffs yield the fewest false positives, improving precision, but reducing the recall rate. When inclusion cutoffs
are relaxed, or iterated methods are used, recall improves,
but precision often degrades, including many sequences
with only partial (local) homology to the query. For
instance, the SAM T2K method had the highest sensitivity,
at 97.9%, but the worst selectivity, at 19.5% (i.e., eight out
of ten sequences retrieved had different overall domain
structures). PSI-BLAST, using E-value inclusion cutoffs of
10-10, 10-5 and 10-3, had the next highest sensitivity
(91.1%, 91.6% and 93.1% respectively) but poor precision (between 22.6% and 34%). A conservative parameterization of BLAST produced much higher precision than
PSI-BLAST and T2K, but lower sensitivity: using an E-value
cutoff of 10-20 (the most restrictive cutoff tested), BLAST
had a precision of 86%, but retrieved only 71.1% of global homologs. At the most permissive cutoff – an E-value
of 10-5 – BLAST precision dropped to 40% but retrieved
84% of global homologs. FlowerPower achieves the best
precision of all methods tested – over 97%, regardless of
method parameterization – and recovers between 82–
85% of global homologs. Our recommended Flower-

Power parameterization yields a recall of 85% and an
average precision of 98%. See Figure 1.
The structural and functional variability in protein families complicates every aspect of an automated structural
phylogenomic pipeline. Restricting a set of sequences to
global homologs can be particularly challenging in these
circumstances, as local similarity can result in sequences
with different domain architectures being included in a
dataset. These partial homologs can introduce errors in
function prediction based on homology, as illustrated
below.

Examples of database annotation errors
We include here two examples of misannotated sequences
which we discovered using structural phylogenomic inference of protein families in constructing our PhyloFacts
phylogenomic resource [13]. The first sequence appears to
have been annotated entirely by homology with a protein
with strictly partial (local) similarity. The second, intriguingly, has been investigated experimentally, but neither
the presumed species of origin (human) nor the assigned
domain structure agree with that suggested by structural
phylogenomic inference. While many annotation errors
can also be detected through the use of domain structure
analysis (e.g., through the use of PFAM or similar domain
prediction webservers), the use of FlowerPower to cluster

homologs, suggests that AAF19052 is more likely to be a
bacterial isochorismate synthase; see [17]. See Figure 3.

Conclusion
Rice protein XP_478746
Oryza sativa sequence XP_478746 is a 196-residue protein
annotated as "TIR/P-loop/LRR disease resistance proteinlike protein". Domain analysis using PFAM reveals that
this protein contains only a TIR domain, which occupies
almost the entire length of the sequence, leaving no room
for either a P-loop or leucine-rich-repeat (LRR) region. We
submitted this sequence to the BLAST server at NCBI, and
analyzed the PFAM domain architecture of the top ten
BLAST hits. Although each of the top ten BLAST hits had
significant e-values (<10-50), the majority had domain
architectures quite different from the query. Of the top ten
BLAST hits, only four matched the query in containing a
TIR domain only and being roughly the same length, four
contained obviously different domain structures (including NB-ARC or NB-ARC/LRR domains), and two contained a TIR domain and long (almost 200aa and >700aa)
undefined regions making them unlikely to share the
same domain structure (see Figure 2). We expect the misannotation of XP_478746 was based on a database hit
such as the 987-residue Pinus taeda sequence AAM28917
(one of the top BLAST hits), which contains a TIR domain,
(P-loop containing) NB-ARC domain and LRR region.

FlowerPower, on the other hand, had much higher precision in the 43 sequences it selected from the NR database.
PFAM analysis of FlowerPower sequences, requiring global matches to PFAM domains (PFAM-ls), finds only TIR
domains in each of the sequences selected by FlowerPower. Allowing partial matches (PFAM-fs) detects fragmentary matches to other domains in two sequences: one
(GenBank accession AAL07540) contains a fragmentary
match to an NB-ARC domain, and the second (GenBank
accession BAD94633) has a short (43aa) partial match to
a motile sperm domain. SMART [14] detects only TIR
domains in the FlowerPower sequences.
Details of these analyses are available in Supplementary
Materials. A structural phylogenomic analysis of this protein, including the FlowerPower cluster, is available at
[15].
Putative human neutral sphingomyelinase (AAF19052)
AAF19052 is annotated as a human neutral sphingomyelinase, and is reported to contain a DEATH domain at the
C-terminus [16]. Structural phylogenomic analysis shows
all close homologs are from bacteria, and identifies a Cterminal chorismate-binding domain, but no DEATH
domain. In addition, translated BLAST against the human
genome finds no matches. Structural phylogenomic analysis for this protein, using FlowerPower to gather

FlowerPower is designed for the first step in structural
phylogenomic inference of protein function: selecting a
dataset upon which functional inference will be based.
For phylogenomic inference to be accurate, all sequences
in the set must share the same domain architecture. FlowerPower has been shown to outperform BLAST, PSI-BLAST
and the HMM-based SAM-T2K method at discriminating
between proteins sharing the same domain structure and
those having only local similarity. The precision of FlowerPower is much higher than the other methods tested,
with an average false positive error rate under 3%, though
PSI-BLAST and SAM-T2K have better sensitivity.
We have presented two examples of sequences with errors
in their domain structure annotations producing errors in
function prediction, which would have been prevented
had a structural phylogenomic inference protocol been
adopted. In these two cases, errors could also have been
prevented through domain-structure analyses of each
individual sequence using resources such as PFAM. FlowerPower provides an independent means of both preventing such errors and post-hoc identification of existing
errors, through anomaly detection. Clustering sequences
using a method such as FlowerPower enables us to assume
all (or at least, most) of the sequences in the set have the
same domain structure. If such a set contains sequences
labelled differently, as in the examples presented here,
oddball annotations will stand out as anomalous, signalling a potential error. Phylogenetic tree construction of
these global homology clusters for phylogenomic inference of protein function enhances the specificity of functional annotation possible.
The FlowerPower method depends on two core methods
to detect and align sequences: SCI-PHY subfamily identification and subfamily HMM construction. Subfamilies
identified by SCI-PHY correspond closely to conserved
clades found by phylogenetic analysis and to functional
subtypes found by experts (submitted). Subfamily HMMs
based on SCI-PHY subfamilies model the subtypes within
a diverse protein family, accommodating lineage-specific
structural and functional changes. Relative to the use of a
single HMM for the family as a whole, subfamily HMMs
have improved sensitivity at the same false positive rate:
they identify dramatically more true positives under high
significance cutoffs and provide greater separation
between true and false positives. In addition, novel
sequences can be classified to existing subfamily HMMs
with very high accuracy [18].

Analysis 2 rice protein XP_478746 and BLAST hits
Analysis of rice protein XP_478746 and BLAST hits. The PFAM domain architectures of XP_478746, annotated as a
"TIR/P-loop/LRR disease resistance protein-like protien" (sic) from Oryza sativa, and its closest BLAST homologs are shown.
XP_478746 contains a TIR domain only with no room for the P-loop and LRR regions; the sequence is therefore misannotated.
We expect XP_478746 was annotated based on local similarity to a sequence such as AAM28917 (annotated as a "putative
TIR/NBS/LRR disease resistance protein" from Pinus taeda), which does contain the NB-ARC and LRR domains. See text for
details.

A web server for FlowerPower is available at [19]. The
default parameters are designed to retrieve sequences
sharing the same domain structure; users can override the
parameters to retrieve sequences sharing local or globallocal similarity. Results include the native FlowerPower
subfamily-HMM based alignment and a realignment of
the sequences using MUSCLE. Users also have the option
of generating functional subfamily using SCI-PHY and
constructing subfamily HMMs. Alignments and SCI-PHY
tree can be viewed online or downloaded.

Future work
FlowerPower's high precision appears to be quite robust
to different parameter settings, but there is clearly room
for improvement in FlowerPower sensitivity. We plan to
test the effect of other parameterizations of FlowerPower,
including different ways to select the initial set for multiple sequence alignment, different SAM parameter settings
for aligning sequences to subfamily HMMs, and score and
alignment statistic requirements for inclusion of new
sequences. Future experiments will also be performed on

false positives in the final cluster. We plan to test FlowerPower's performance at these tasks.

Methods
Profile drift is another area where we expect FlowerPower
to provide superior performance. The use of subfamily
hidden Markov models in retrieving new sequences in
each iteration ensures that the seed and its homologs are
included in the next iteration. Since subfamily HMMs
improve the separation between true homologs and nonhomologs, FlowerPower should prevent the intrusion of

The FlowerPower algorithm
FlowerPower is an iterative clustering algorithm akin to
PSI-BLAST that retrieves and aligns sequences using profile methods. However, instead of using a single profile for
homolog detection, FlowerPower constructs and uses subfamily HMMs to detect and align sequences in the next
iteration; this is designed to improve alignment accuracy

and prevent profile drift. Automated alignment analysis
and quality control at every step ensure that homologs
selected meet user-specified criteria. When parameterized
for functional inference, quality control measures of
alignment overlap and sequence identity result in clusters
composed of sequences with the same domain architecture.
Selection of sequences for FlowerPower search
The input to FlowerPower is a seed sequence, a specified
database from which putative homologs will be selected,
and user-selected alignment quality control criteria (coverage and percent identity cutoffs). Due to the computational complexity of HMM scoring, the first step in
FlowerPower involves running PSI-BLAST to gather a set
of potential homologs against which subfamily HMMs
will search. When FlowerPower is used to select globally
alignable matches, this set is filtered to remove sequences
that are clearly too long or too short to share the same
domain structure as the seed. The final set, S, is then used
as the target database from which potential homologs are
selected using HMM scoring.
Creation of the initial multiple sequence alignment
We select a set of sequences with high sequence similarity
to the seed, as follows. We construct an HMM for the seed
sequence using the SAM modelfromalign software.
Sequences from S with a BLAST E-value <= 10-10 to the
seed are aligned to the HMM using the align2model software; using HMMs to align the sequence produces somewhat more global alignments than produced by BLAST.
Sequence alignments are then examined; sequences having >=25% pairwise identity to the seed and passing minimum fractional (length-dependent) bi-directional
overlap between the database hit and the seed (termed the
"coverage") are accepted. The "coverage" fraction varies
between 0.60 for sequences of <100aa and 0.85 for
sequences of >500aa. We then use MUSCLE [20] to realign the sequences. The MUSCLE alignment is submitted
to SCI-PHY [21] for subfamily identification and subfamily HMM construction [18].
Iterated sequence retrieval and alignment
In subsequent stages, the sequences in S are scored with
the subfamily HMMs using the SAM hmmscore program,
selecting sequences for alignment based on score significance. At program commencement, the E-value cutoff for
inclusion is fairly stringent (E-value <= 10-10) and is gradually increased (made less stringent) in each iteration to
reach a maximum of 10-5. E-values are computed based
on local-local scoring (SAM parameter - sw 2) and an
assumed database size of 100,000. Each sequence receiving a significant score is aligned to the subfamily HMM
giving it the strongest score, to produce a multiple
sequence alignment of all sequences passing the E-value

cutoff. Alignment quality control for minimum percent
identity and bi-directional coverage is then performed to
remove sequences not meeting these criteria (these values
are user-specifiable parameters of the algorithm). The new
multiple sequence alignment is provided as input to SCIPHY, subfamily HMMs are constructed, and the process is
iterated until no new sequences match inclusion criteria,
or the number of sequences or iterations reaches a predefined cutoff. Additional details on alignment quality
control parameters, including coverage and percent identity, are available in Supplementary Materials. See Figure
4.
Subfamily identification using SCI-PHY
FlowerPower uses the SCI-PHY (Subfamily Classification
In Phylogenomics) method to predict functional subfamilies in each iteration, based on the multiple sequence
alignment of sequences retrieved at that stage. SCI-PHY
constructs a hierarchical tree using agglomerative clustering, and cuts the tree into subtrees using a combination of
information theoretic methods and Dirichlet mixture
densities [22]. SCI-PHY uses an encoding cost measurement under a Dirichlet mixture density to determine an
optimal cut of the tree into subtrees. SCI-PHY subfamily
classification has been shown to correspond closely to
phylogenetic clades and expert identified subtypes (submitted). A detailed description of the algorithm is published in [21].
Subfamily HMM construction
Subfamilies identified by SCI-PHY are used to construct
subfamily hidden Markov models, which are used to score
and align sequences for the next iteration of FlowerPower.
Subfamily HMM parameters are estimated using an information-sharing protocol enabling statistics to be shared
across subfamilies in a position- and subfamily-specific
manner. Amino acid distributions at positions conserved
across the family are fixed for each subfamily; this ensures
that even very small subfamilies include information
about positions defining the family as a whole. At other
positions, subfamilies share statistics with subfamilies
aligning similar residues, while keeping their statistics
separate from subfamilies aligning very dissimilar residues. This protocol retains specificity at subfamily-defining regions or motifs, while generalizing well to more
distant homologs. This provides high specificity of classification while simultaneously improving the sensitivity of
the subfamily HMM to detect new members [18]. Recent
experiments on a large representative dataset of 515 SCOP
folds show that subfamily HMMs dramatically increase
the separation between true homologs and non-homologous proteins with different folds (submitted).

Comparison of FlowerPower with BLAST, PSI-BLAST and
T2K
BLAST was tested using three different e-value cut-offs: 1020, 10-10 and 10-5. For PSI-BLAST, we varied the number of
iterations (three and five) and e-value cut-offs (10-10, 10-5
and 10-3). The results from five iterations were almost
indistinguishable to results obtained from using three
iterations and are not shown. SAM-T2K was run using
default parameters.

Nine seed sequences for database search were selected
from SwissPFAM [12] based on the following criteria: (1)
a majority of the sequence matching PFAM domains,
based on the PFAM gathering threshold, (2) no undefined
regions of >80 amino acids (i.e., a region with no PFAM
match), and (3) each PFAM domain matched a solved
protein structure classified by the Structural Classification
of Proteins (SCOP) database [23]. Table 1 and Figure 5
provide details of seed sequences used in these experiments.
BLAST, PSI-BLAST, T2K and FlowerPower were then used
to retrieve proteins from SwissPFAM version 15. Retrieved
sequences were labelled as homologous, non-homologous, or
indeterminate. To be called homologous, a database hit had
to be clearly in the same domain architecture class as the
seed sequence (i.e., the same or structurally equivalent
PFAM domains (based on SCOP analysis) in the same
order), with any unlabelled region restricted to less than
80 amino acids. PFAM domains are considered equivalent
if they match at the level of SCOP superfamily. For
instance, the PFAM CARD, DEATH and DED domains are
all members of the SCOP DEATH domain superfamily,
and would be considered structurally equivalent in our
analysis. The set of proteins in SwissPFAM matching these
criteria form the full set of global homologs; methods
identifying all the global homologs would therefore have

perfect sensitivity. Proteins were defined as non-homologs if
they were much longer than the seed (i.e., hit length >
seed length + 500), contained a PFAM domain not
homologous to any domain in the seed (based on disagreement at the level of SCOP fold), contained an unequal number of homologous PFAM domains, or had a
different ordering of PFAM domains than those in the
seed. All other proteins were called indeterminate, as their
global structural homology or lack thereof could not be
rigorously determined on the basis of these analyses. For
a given homolog-detection method, we then define True
Positive hits (TP, global homologs correctly selected by
that method), True Negatives (TN, non-global-homologs
that are correctly rejected), False Positives (FP, non-global-homologs that are incorrectly accepted), and False
Negatives (FN, true global homologs that are incorrectly
rejected). Results of these experiments are shown in Figure
1.

SwissProt identifiers are shown in the first column. The number of global homologs (GH; proteins sharing the same domain structure) for a seed
was determined by the total number of proteins in the SwissPFAM dataset that shared the same domain structure as the seed. Non-homologs (NH)
are those having an obviously different domain structure. Indeterminate sequences (IND) are those whose global homology to the seed or lack
thereof could not be rigorously determined. See Methods for details.

PFAM domain architecture of the seed dataset used to evaluate BLAST, PSI-BLAST, T2K and FlowerPower
PFAM domain architecture of the seed dataset used to evaluate BLAST, PSI-BLAST, T2K and FlowerPower.
Sequences were selected based on the following criteria: each sequence had to contain recognizable PFAM domains (based on
the PFAM gathering threshold), no undefined regions of >80 amino acids (i.e., a region with no PFAM match), and each PFAM
domain was required to match a 3D structure classified by the SCOP database. For details of the seed sequence domain architectures see Table 1.
