Abstract
Background: Automated candidate gene prediction systems allow geneticists to hone in on
disease genes more rapidly by identifying the most probable candidate genes linked to the disease
phenotypes under investigation. Here we assessed the ability of eight different candidate gene
prediction systems to predict disease genes in intervals previously associated with type 2 diabetes
by benchmarking their performance against genes implicated by recent genome-wide association
studies.
Results: Using a search space of 9556 genes, all but one of the systems pruned the genome in
favour of genes associated with moderate to highly significant SNPs. Of the 11 genes associated
with highly significant SNPs identified by the genome-wide association studies, eight were flagged
as likely candidates by at least one of the prediction systems. A list of candidates produced by a
previous consensus approach did not match any of the genes implicated by 706 moderate to highly
significant SNPs flagged by the genome-wide association studies. We prioritized genes associated
with medium significance SNPs.
Conclusion: The study appraises the relative success of several candidate gene prediction systems
against independent genetic data. Even when confronted with challengingly large intervals, the
candidate gene prediction systems can successfully select likely disease genes. Furthermore, they
can be used to filter statistically less-well-supported genetic data to select more likely candidates.
We suggest consensus approaches fail because they penalize novel predictions made from
independent underlying databases. To realize their full potential further work needs to be done on
prioritization and annotation of genes.

Background
The process of linking genes to disease phenotypes is rapidly gaining momentum since the first disease-causing
gene was identified 25 years ago [1]. Alternative
approaches adopted in the past to identify disease genes
are the candidate gene approach, where likely suspects are
prioritised and screened on a genome-wide basis; and
linkage analysis where specific loci are determined systematically using family studies. The two approaches have
been synthesized into a pipeline by completion of the
Human Genome Project; and further enabled by the
increased availability of high-throughput experimental
data and the development of sophisticated bioinformatics
tools. In addition there have been efforts in the bioinformatics community to systematize and automate candidate gene prediction. Automated prediction systems
provide geneticists with a reduced list of genes estimated
to have a high probability of involvement in the disease
phenotype by sifting through hundreds to thousands of
genes. Ultimately, these tools aim to give the researcher
the best possible guidance in honing in on the gene culprits for further biological confirmation. Since their introduction in the early 2000s, the predictive powers of
automated candidate gene prediction systems have
improved, largely due to increases in biological systems
knowledge and more effective algorithms.
Candidate gene prediction systems vary in their approach
and the data sources they draw on in generating predictions. These are summarised in Figure 1 and Table 1.
Comparing the performance of these systems can be difficult because of the use of custom benchmark test sets by
individual groups. Typically, benchmarking data is
derived from genotype-phenotype information from the
Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database
[2], but groups have used varying subsets of diseases. Several groups have tried to use standard benchmark sets [35], but these efforts have been limited. In addition, it is
difficult to predict whether benchmarks which predominately contain data on well characterised diseases with
Mendelian transmission patterns (i.e. dominant, recessive, X-linked) resulting from mutations in single genes
[6] will be effective in predicting genes involved in less
well characterised diseases, or in complex diseases.
A recent effort by Tiffin and colleagues [7] to identify candidate disease genes for the complex disease type II diabetes (T2D) and the related obesity trait predicted 12 genes
in previously implicated chromosomal regions. The study
also allowed a limited comparison of seven candidate
gene prediction systems. Since that time two genomewide association studies (GWAs) on T2D undertaken by
the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC)
and the Genetics Replication and Meta-analysis Consortium (DIAGRAM) have been published [8,9]. GWAs are a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/S1/S69

powerful tool for identifying genetic variants linked to
complex diseases because they are more sensitive than
linkage studies to small to moderate effect size contributions from polygenic and oligogenic diseases. The data
from these GWAs allow the assessment of the predictions
made by Tiffin et al., as well as evaluation of the effectiveness of predictions made by the individual automated
candidate gene prediction systems used in their study and
our system, Gentrepid [4]. We assessed the candidate gene
predictions systems' ability to select robustly supported
genes from the GWAs and used them to filter noisy data
from statistically less well supported genes to select
favoured candidates.

Results
Predictions
All methods were given the starting set of 9556 genes
mapped to chromosomal intervals implicated in T2D as
assessed by Tiffin et al., except for POCUS which was run
against a search space of 562 genes. The POCUS method
was confined to the smaller search space because "poorly
defined susceptibility regions or regions with questionable association with the disease are obscured by background noise" [7]. The number of candidate gene
predictions made by the eight methods varied from two to
3093. POCUS generated the smallest number of candidates but neither of the two predictions matched genes in
either the highly significant (HS) or medium-to-highly
significant (MHWD) data sets. Other candidate gene prediction methods made considerably more predictions.
The largest numbers of predictions were made by G2D
(3,093 candidate gene predictions) and eVOC (2,496 predictions). These comprise almost one third and one quarter of the search space respectively. Thus neither of these
methods prune the search space particularly well. Excluding POCUS, the least number of predictions was made by
Gentrepid comprising 502 genes in known-disease-gene
mode.
Accuracy of predictions
To assess the accuracy of the predictions, all eight systems
were compared with genes found in previously-implicated intervals strongly linked to T2D by the GWAs. Figure
2 shows the comparative performance of seven of these
methods in selecting the 11 genes in the HS GWA data set.
Several metrics were calculated to assess accuracy. No metrics were calculated for POCUS as neither of its two predictions matched genes in either the HS or MHWD data sets.

The Enrichment Ratio is a general measure of the system's
ability to accurately prune the search space. Enrichment
Ratios ranged from 1 to 5 for the seven remaining prediction systems. The highest Enrichments Ratios were
obtained by Gentrepid and GeneSeeker. These results were
robust when the upper and lower (not shown) 95%

Table 1: Automated Candidate Gene Prediction Systems

Semi-Automated Systems
GeneSeeker is a semi-automated web-server tool which selects positional candidates based on expression and phenotypic data from human and
mouse. Queries must be formulated by the end-user using Boolean expressions [13,33]. ♠
Systems Biology Techniques
Prioritizer uses pathway and interaction data from KEGG [17,34], Reactome [35], and HPRD [36]. Interactions are also predicted using a Bayesian
technique based on GO keywords [23] and other databases [5].
In Gentrepid Common Pathway Scanning (CPS), pathways are associated with phenotypes using either known disease genes, or by searching for
enrichment of pathways across multiple disease intervals associated with the phenotype [4]. ♠
Oti et al use protein-protein interaction data from HPRD [36], Y2H [37,38], and PCP [39,40] giving coverage of 10 894 human genes [24].
Genotype-Phenotype Mapping Methods
G2D [32] uses biomedical literature to associate pathological conditions with GO terms [23]. Candidate genes are identified by homology to GOannotated disease-associated genes. ♠
Gentrepid Common Module Profiling (CMP) searches for enrichment of particular domains in gene clusters associated with a particular phenotype.
Domains are extracted either from known disease genes or by comparison of multiple disease intervals [4]. ♠
POCUS searches for over-representation of functional annotation among multiple loci associated with the same disease. Functional annotation is
based on keywords from InterPro domains [22] and GO [23]. No a priori knowledge of the phenotype is required [3]. ♠
Techniques based on a bipartite distribution of "disease" and "non-disease" genes
The eVOC system uses text mining of biomedical literature to associate a phenotype with anatomy terms and links these with human expression
data to produce a ranked list of disease genes. The classifier is a machine-learning technique, based on a bipartite training set of 17 known "disease
genes" and 306 "non-disease genes" [30]. ♠
DGP (Disease Gene Prediction) is a web tool which selects genes based on protein sequence properties. The properties analysed by DGP include
protein length, degree of sequence conservation, the extent of phylogenetic relationship and paralogy patterns [31,41]. ♠
PROSPECTR (PRiOrization by Sequence and Phylogenetic Extent of CandidaTe Regions) uses an alternating decision tree to discriminate "disease
genes" from "non-disease genes" using a classifier based on sequence features such as gene length, protein length, and similarity of homologs in
other species [12]. ♠
Hybrid techniques
SUSPECTS combines a genotype-phenotype mapping method based on disease-gene-associated keywords from InterPro and GO, and expression
libraries, with the PROSPECTR Boolean classifier. Disease genes are prioritized [21]. ♠

confidence interval limits were taken into account. The
lowest Enrichment Ratios were associated with the
Machine Learning methods. This is not surprising, as the
classifiers are trained to distinguish "disease genes" from
"non-disease genes" and are ignorant of any concept of
phenotype. The Specificity of a system measures its ability
to reject genes not associated with the phenotype. Specificity scores among all seven methods ranged from 0.68 to
0.99, with a median of 0.92. As a group, the Machine
Learning methods were poorer at rejection. G2D also performed poorly on this metric, but this result is slightly
misleading because it does not take into account G2D's
prioritization method which will be discussed later.
The Sensitivity is a measure of a system's ability to find the
disease genes in the search space. A caveat here is not all
of the GWA predictions are currently confirmed. G2D is
by far the standout performer in Sensitivity, with eVOC
ranked second. However, as can be seen from the other
metrics, this result is obtained at the expense of Specificity
for both systems. Gentrepid's Sensitivity is on par with
most of the Machine Learning methods but with higher
Specificity. The high Specificity reflects the high quality of
the data in the underlying databases. The lower Sensitivity
is due to incompleteness of these databases with respect to
all human genes.

Figure 2 shows the comparative performance of methods
when assessed against the 61 T2D associated genes with
moderate to strong SNP signals (MHWD) in the Tiffin
chromosomal intervals. The MHWD data set is not as statistically well supported as the HS set, and would be
expected to contain some genes associated with T2D and
others that are false positives. Perhaps the most interesting
metric to look at here is the Sensitivity which should fall
compared to the values for the HS set because of the lower
signal to noise ratio in the MHWD set. All the systems
except one, SUSPECTS, passed this negative test. More
importantly, application of the systems to this noisy
genetic data allows selection of a subset of candidates on
the basis of molecular data (see below).
The results shown for Gentrepid in Figure 2 are for the
known-disease-gene mode. In ab initio mode, Gentrepid's
CPS method identified 506 pathways containing a total of
1980 candidate gene predictions. This resulted in Enrichment Ratios of 3.3 and 2.1 when the HS and MHWD full
gene sets were considered (Table 2).
In ab initio mode, the CMP method generated 527 predictions by limiting the selection to the top 10% most probable genes. This resulted in correct prediction of one gene
from the HS set and five from the MHWD set, yielding a

Figure 1
Data sources and approaches used in automated candidate gene prediction methods
Data sources and approaches used in automated candidate gene prediction methods. (A): Most systems draw on
at least two types of data. SUSPECTS [21] (not shown) uses keywords from InterPro [22] and GO [23], co-expression data, and
also incorporates the PROSPECTR module [12] (shown on right). (B): Upper left Gene clustering approaches associate a gene
cluster with a phenotype via a group member. For example, Systems Biology approaches [4,5,24] group genes whose protein
products interact; and link them to a phenotype using a group-member gene associated with the phenotype. Systems Biology
methods assume oligogenic diseases are associated with disruption in proteins that participate in a common complex or pathway [25]. Other gene clustering systems look for enrichment of keywords or domains associated with particular phenotypes
and suggest candidate genes with similar properties. These systems are based on the principle that candidate genes have similar
functions to disease genes already determined [26-28]. Upper right Phenotype clustering approaches such as that of Freudenberg & Propping [29] group related phenotypes into superphenotypes. Lower left Most of the Machine Learning approaches do
not use phenotype information and are based on the concept that the genome consists of a bipartite distribution of genes:
those which cause diseases, and those that do not. By analysing these two gene sets with respect to discriminating variables, a
profile for "non-disease genes" and "disease genes" is produced which enables training of a classifier. A novel gene submitted to
the classifier is flagged as either "disease-causing" or "non-disease causing". Systems include eVOC [30], PROSPECTR [12], SUSPECTS [21] and DGP [31]. Finally G2D, lower right, is a transitive method that maps phenotypes to genes [32] by interfacing literature- and keyword-based ontologies.
Enrichment Ratio of 2.2 when applied to the HS and 2.0
for the MHWD gene data sets.
It is also interesting to note the effect of lack of annotation
on these results. Only five of 11 genes in the HS dataset,
and 19 of 61 genes in the MHWD set contained KEGG or
BioCarta pathway annotations.When we included only
genes containing pathway information from the gene

datasets (designated 'annotated' in Table 2) we observed
Enrichment Ratios of 7.2 against the HS and 6.8 against
the MHWD pathway-annotated sets. Sensitivities also
improved by a factor of 2 for the HS dataset. By extrapolation, if all genes were pathway annotated, we could expect
approximately two- to three-fold improvement in Enrichment and Sensitivity scores.

Prioritization
Although the metrics discussed provide useful measures
of a candidate gene prediction system's performance,
another criterion of importance to geneticists is the system's ability to prioritize predictions. Although several
methods claim the ability to prioritize (Table 1), only
G2D provided prioritized predictions in Tiffin et al. [7].
Hence only G2D and Gentrepid will be discussed here.
Because Gentrepid only made 502 predictions in toto, we
took the top 502 predictions made by G2D and recalculated the Enrichment Ratio, Sensitivity and Specificity for
this restricted set of favoured predictions. ER and Specificity significantly improved to 3.1 and 0.95 such that G2D
surpassed Gentrepid's gross ER and almost equalled Gentrepid in Specificity. The improvement in these two metrics came at the expense of Sensitivity which was reduced
to 0.16, but the G2D system still managed to maintain its
lead on this metric.

In G2D's prioritization system, a GO-metric is calculated
for each gene in the search space based on how well its GO
profile fits the GO profile of the disease genes inferred
from MeSH terms. An R-score is calculated for each gene
by normalizing against the number of genes in the
genome with better GO-metrics for the phenotype. Genes

with R-scores closer to zero are better fits to the
phenotype.
Gentrepid CPS ranks genes by the number of loci in the
search space involved in a particular pathway. In ab initio
mode, of the 53 intervals searched, the top pathway, focal
adhesion, was represented in 35 of these. All five of the HS
dataset genes were represented by pathways found in at
least eight intervals. Pathways implicated in at least eight
intervals constituted the top 40% of the 506 pathways
containing 1749 candidates. In these pathways, Gentrepid
identified all five pathway annotated genes from the HS
dataset, and 18 of the 19 pathway annotated genes from
the MHWD gene data set. Other figures for CMP are given
in Table 2.
CMP ab initio looks for protein domains enriched in the
search space compared to the genome by taking a census
of domains in the search space and the genome. Two
expectation values are calculated to estimate the frequency
of occurrence of genes with domains of interest based on
a random combination of these domains ea and the rarest
domain eb [4]. Figure 3 shows the data ranked on a χ2 test
based on ea was most effective in prioritizing the HS data.
This reflects our experience of phenotypes with genotypes

encoded by multi-domain proteins, as would be expected
for diseases associated with signaling. For metabolic diseases associated with single-domain proteins, eb may be a
better measure.
Although the G2D prioritization system appears more
sensitive than the coarse-grained prioritization of Gentrepid, the performance of both systems was roughly
equivalent against the HS set. Both systems were moderately successful in prioritizing the HS data. For example,
of the seven genes in the HS dataset predicted by G2D,
four were ranked in the top 15% by G2D's prioritization
method (bold in Figure 3). Significant work needs to be
done to improve the prioritization schemes of both G2D
and Gentrepid.
Finally, we used the candidate gene predictions systems to
filter the less statistically-well-supported MHWD data set
(MHWD – HS): effectively adding more power to the
GWA study. Prioritized predictions are the unbolded
genes in Figure 3. Additional unprioritized predictions
made for the MHWD dataset using the other candidate
predictions systems are given as supplementary data in
Additional file 1.

Discussion
Candidate disease gene prediction is a rapidly moving
area of bioinformatics research with the potential to
deliver great benefits to human health. By assisting geneticists to use existing biological information to investigate
disease loci obtained by linkage analysis and association
studies, disease genes can be identified more rapidly. The
need for good applications in the area of candidate gene
prediction is becoming increasing important as the proliferation of SNP-based association studies produces valuable genetic information in need of analysis.
The biggest problem facing candidate gene prediction
today is the accuracy and completeness of the underlying

databases. Failure to make a prediction is mostly due to
incomplete data coverage. For example, 65% of human
proteins have GO terms but only 25% of these are manually annotated. Systems drawing on GO terms like G2D
are potentially able to make predictions for 65% of genes
but only around one third of these are likely to be accurate. Systems Biology methods like Gentrepid CPS are reliant on pathway and protein-protein interaction data. One
of the databases CPS draws on is OPHID [10], one of the
most complete protein-protein interaction datasets, containing over 48 000 interactions. However these 48,000
interactions are estimated to be only 13% of the complete
human interactome [11]. Completeness of the underlying
data clearly impacts the Sensitivity of the Gentrepid CPS
method. As time goes on this constraint will ease as these
databases are further populated. In the meantime, we
have shown that the use of independent biological data to
make complementary candidate gene predictions is one
way to ameliorate the problem of incomplete data coverage (see Figure 3) [4].
In addition to the predictions made by the individual candidate gene prediction systems in Tiffin et al., a set of nine
"winners" were chosen using a consensus approach [7].
These nine candidate genes were independently predicted
by six of the seven prediction systems studied. A larger
consensus set, chosen by five of the seven methods, contained 94 genes [7]. None of the genes in either of these
consensus lists matched any of the genes in the HS and
MHWD gene sets. Even if we compile a third tier of consensus genes from any four of the seven methods (269
genes) only one gene (VEGF) fell within the HS data set
and only three genes (CHN2, B4GALT5, VEGF) matched
the MHWD data set. Clearly the consensus approach is
not working and it is easy to see why when the underlying
databases are considered (Figure 1A). Candidate gene prediction systems that use an independent data set, not
drawn upon by most of the other methods, will be penalized. Possibly the only benefit of a consensus approach is

Conclusion
Candidate gene prediction systems have typically been
benchmarked on well characterized oligogenic phenotypes. GeneSeeker [13] produced a 10-fold enrichment
using a data set consisting of eight diseases. Gentrepid's
combined methods [4] produced an Enrichment Ratio of
13 when 29 diseases with a total of 170 known disease
genes were used. For 29 diseases with 163 genes, POCUS
[3] reported Enrichment Ratios between 12 to 42-fold,
depending on the size of the intervals in the search space.
The PRIORITIZER [5] method yielded a 2.8-fold enrichment using a data set consisting of 96 heritable disorders.
In summary, Enrichment Ratios of 3 to 13 have been
reported in benchmarks, but a substantial part of the data
used for these studies has been limited to oligogenic phenotypes, where several different genes may cause the disease, but a single mutation in each case or family has a
large effect.

to give the user a false sense of accuracy when confronted
with noisy data.
Clearly much work still remains to improve the sensitivity
and specificity of candidate gene prediction methods but
some general conclusions are possible. Machine Learning
methods were not as effective as other methods. Most of
the Machine Learning approaches do not use phenotype
information and are based on the concept that the
genome consists of a bipartite distribution of genes: those
which cause diseases, and those that do not. The evidence
supporting this assumption is limited [12]. We believe the
concept that there is a difference between "disease genes"
and "nondisease genes" is intrinsically flawed and no
such Boolean classification exists. We hypothesize that the
ability of these methods to predict disease genes in test
sets is based on selection effects in the data: possibly rare,
highly penetrant monogenic diseases, such as those
involved in metabolic syndromes, are over-represented
among known disease genes because they have been easier targets to identify. Although these systems were not as
effective as the other candidate gene prediction systems,
their performance was not greatly different. However, we
believe that unlike systems which attempt to map genotype to phenotype, Machine Learning systems based on
the disease gene/non-disease gene concept will not
improve as more biological data becomes available.

Some doubts have been raised about the ability of systems
to predict candidates for complex polygenic diseases such
as T2D where multiple genes interact to create a permissive gene pool for disease genesis. The candidate gene prediction systems did prune the genome in favour of
moderately to highly significant SNPs identified by the
GWAs under semi-blind testing on a complex polygenic
disease. Enrichment Ratios calculated in this study suggest
that most of the oligogenic benchmarks have been reasonably good predictors of system performance.

Methods
Benchmark datasets
Eight candidate gene prediction systems were assessed on
their ability to predict genes involved in T2D by comparison against genes implicated by recent GWAs. Two data
sets of T2D-implicated genes were used as the benchmark:
a Highly Significant gene set (HS) of 21 genes and a Moderate to Highly significant gene set derived from the
WTCCC and DIAGRAM studies (MHWD) of 172 genes
[8,9]. The HS gene set contained 11 genes which mapped
to the chromosomal regions investigated by Tiffin et al.
(hereafter Tiffin intervals) [7]. Genes associated with 706
moderately significant SNPs with a frequentist additive pvalue of <0.001, good clustering and intact NCBI build 36
reference ids were taken from WTCCC T2D data [8]. SNPs
positioned between the 5' UTR and 3' UTR of a known
gene structure, 1000 bases upstream of a 5' UTR or 1000
bases downstream of 3' UTR of a known gene were considered to implicate the gene in T2D disease susceptibility.
This moderately significant list was combined with the
genes from the HS data set to generate the MHWD dataset,
yielding 172 genes genome wide of which 61 genes
mapped to the Tiffin intervals [7].

Data sources for predictions
The search space available to all eight automated candidate gene prediction systems consisted of 9556 genes in
53 chromosomal loci assessed by Tiffin et al. to be
involved in T2D by various linkage and association studies. We matched 96.5% of all Ensembl gene entries [14]
provided to NCBI Entrez ids. All remaining genes were
unable to be matched due either to the Ensembl entry
having an unknown gene symbol label or because the
entry was ambiguous or associated with a redundant gene
symbol name entry. Ensembl entries and NCBI id matching was carried out at four levels, in order: approved symbol name, previous symbol names, Uniprot/SwissProt
Accession and RefSeq Ids. Data conversion keys for
matching between databases were acquired from BioMart
[15].

Predictions made by seven candidate gene prediction
methods were also obtained from Tiffin et al. [7]. Nine
disease-implicated genes were available to the systems as
seeds (PPARG, GYS1, IRS1, INS, KCNJ11, ABCC8,
SLC2A1, PPARGC1, CAPN10). Two of the genes – PPARG
and KCNJ11, are implicated by the highly significant
SNPs detected by GWAs but are not in the Tiffin intervals
and are thus not included in the search space or benchmark set.
Candidate gene predictions
The candidate gene predictions for seven of the systems
are detailed elsewhere [7]. Briefly, GeneSeeker selected
genes from the search space using a Boolean expression
based on 14 keywords selected by an expert user [7].
PROSPECTR, DGP and eVOC are Boolean classifiers
which require only the search space as input. G2D and
Gentrepid in ab initio mode, also only require the search
space. POCUS potentially only needs the search space as
input, but this was restricted to the seven best supported
intervals of the 53 available, as judged by the POCUS
team. SUSPECTS and Gentrepid, in known-disease-gene
mode, used the nine known disease genes associated with
the phenotype as seeds. SUSPECTS additionally draws on
predictions from the PROSPECTR Boolean classifier.

Gentrepid predictions are discussed in detail here for the
first time. Gentrepid implements two different modules to
derive predictions: CPS – a systems biology method; and
CMP – a method that associates phenotypes with particular domains. CPS and CMP can be used in two input
modes: using known disease genes as a seed or using only
the search space (ab initio mode).
In known-disease-gene input mode, CPS searches all
pathway and interaction data in BioCarta [16], KEGG [17]
and I2D (formerly OPHID) [10] to extract all genes associated with the disease gene, and then filters this list

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/S1/S69

against implicated loci. Genes are ranked based on the
total number of genes implicated in the pathway. For
example, if two known disease gene seeds and three genes
in the loci being investigated are found in the same pathway, the pathway is given a rank of five against the phenotype. CMP parses the protein sequences of the known
disease genes associated with the phenotype into domains
using the Pfam library of Hidden Markov Models
(HMMs) [18] and then retrieves any other genes with
related domain content from the genome. A score
between 0 and 1 is generated reflecting the candidate
gene's similarity to a known disease gene [4]. The same
nine disease genes and 53 chromosomal cytogenetic
bands were used by Gentrepid as per Tiffin et al..
In ab initio mode, Gentrepid can make predictions in the
absence of known disease genes if two or more loci are
provided as input. Gentrepid's CPS ab initio method is
based on the premise that pathways whose genes are more
prevalent within disease-implicated loci (chromosomal
regions) compared to the entire genome have a higher
probability of involvement in the pathoetiology of the
disease phenotype of interest. Analogous to the known
disease gene mode, pathways are ranked by the number of
loci involved. The CMP ab initio method searches for
enrichment of domains in the loci with respect to the
genome and ranks genes based on the statistical significance of the domain enrichment (equations 2 and 4 in [4]
where mn is replaced by Σ – the total number of genes in
the intervals examined).
For each input mode, a final list of predictions is made by
consolidating all predictions from both the CMP and CPS
modules.
Metrics for comparisons
Systems were compared using three metrics: Enrichment
Ratio, Sensitivity and Specificity. The Enrichment Ratio
calculations were calculated as below [4]:

EnrichmentRatio =

TP /(TP + FP )
genes implicated / ∑ genes all
∑
(1)

The denominator was obtained by dividing the number of
T2D implicated genes by the total number of genes within
all surveyed chromosomal regions.
Sensitivity and Specificity were calculated as below:

Sensitivity =

TP
(TP + FN )

Specificity =

TN
(TN + FP )

TP is the number of true positives, FP is the number of
false positives, TN is the number of true negatives and FN
is the number of false negatives. Sensitivity is the proportion of true positives among all disease genes in the chromosomal regions. Specificity is the proportion of true
negatives among genes not associated with the disease in
chromosomal regions. Confidence intervals were estimated using the method of Newcombe [19] implemented
using the CIcalculator software [20].
