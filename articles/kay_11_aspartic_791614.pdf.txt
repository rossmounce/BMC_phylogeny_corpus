The aspartic proteinase family of three
Phytophthora species
John Kay1, Harold JG Meijer2, Arjen ten Have3 and Jan AL van Kan2*

Abstract
Background: Phytophthora species are oomycete plant pathogens with such major social and economic impact
that genome sequences have been determined for Phytophthora infestans, P. sojae and P. ramorum. Pepsin-like
aspartic proteinases (APs) are produced in a wide variety of species (from bacteria to humans) and contain
conserved motifs and landmark residues. APs fulfil critical roles in infectious organisms and their host cells.
Annotation of Phytophthora APs would provide invaluable information for studies into their roles in the physiology
of Phytophthora species and interactions with their hosts.
Results: Genomes of Phytophthora infestans, P. sojae and P. ramorum contain 11-12 genes encoding APs. Nine of
the original gene models in the P. infestans database and several in P. sojae and P. ramorum (three and four,
respectively) were erroneous. Gene models were corrected on the basis of EST data, consistent positioning of
introns between orthologues and conservation of hallmark motifs. Phylogenetic analysis resolved the Phytophthora
APs into 5 clades. Of the 12 sub-families, several contained an unconventional architecture, as they either lacked a
signal peptide or a propart region. Remarkably, almost all APs are predicted to be membrane-bound.
Conclusions: One of the twelve Phytophthora APs is an unprecedented fusion protein with a putative G-protein
coupled receptor as the C-terminal partner. The others appear to be related to well-documented enzymes from
other species, including a vacuolar enzyme that is encoded in every fungal genome sequenced to date.
Unexpectedly, however, the oomycetes were found to have both active and probably-inactive forms of an AP
similar to vertebrate BACE, the enzyme responsible for initiating the processing cascade that generates the Ab
peptide central to Alzheimer’s Disease. The oomycetes also encode enzymes similar to plasmepsin V, a membranebound AP that cleaves effector proteins of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum during their translocation
into the host red blood cell. Since the translocation of Phytophthora effector proteins is currently a topic of intense
research activity, the identification in Phytophthora of potential functional homologues of plasmepsin V would
appear worthy of investigation. Indeed, elucidation of the physiological roles of the APs identified here offers areas
for future study. The significant revision of gene models and detailed annotation presented here should
significantly facilitate experimental design.

Background
The oomycete genus Phytophthora is comprised of over
100 species, most of which are plant pathogens [1]. The
most renowned and devastating species is P. infestans,
which contributed to the potato famine in Ireland,
resulting in a million deaths through starvation, and the
mass exodus of many more to other locations, principally in North America [2]. The pathogen continues to

blight modern agriculture and causes an annual loss in
worldwide potato crops approaching $7 billion [3]. The
economic damage has intensified research to increase
our knowledge of this organism that has now been
under investigation for more than 150 years. The genome sequences of P. infestans, and two related species,
P. sojae, causing soybean root and stem rot and
P. ramorum, the sudden oak death pathogen, were
recently determined [4-6]. At 240, 95 and 65 megabases
respectively, there is a considerable difference in the
genome sizes of P. infestans, P. sojae and P. ramorum.
Gene numbers among the three genomes are not

drastically different and there is considerable co-linearity
between them. Genome size expansion in P. infestans
has mainly resulted from escalation in the number of
repeat regions and transposons [4]. Analyses of Phytophthora genomes have identified genes encoding proteins containing novel combinations of previously
identified domains [4,6-9].
In common with other organisms for which genome
sequences have been elucidated, one protein category
which is highly represented in the three Phytophthora
genomes is that of proteolytic enzymes [4]. These protein hydrolases have a wide variety of roles in all organisms including nutrient provision, stress responses and
cell death processes. Proteinases are categorised into a
number of catalytic types, dependent on the nature of
the nucleophile that participates in the catalytic reaction.
The MEROPS database (http://merops.sanger.ac.uk)
classifies proteinases into clans which contain all the
proteins that have arisen from a single evolutionary origin [10]. A clan represents one or more families of proteinases that reveal their evolutionary relationship
through similarities at the primary and 3D-structural
levels. Our interests over many years have focussed on
aspartic proteinases, which belong to the AA clan.
Within this clan, most members reside in the A01
family and are related to the archetypal patriarch, pepsin, or in family A02 which encompasses proteinases
from retroviruses including HIV [11]. APs participate in
a variety of physiological and pathological processes [11]
in vertebrates (e.g. renin in hypertension and the bsecretase or BACE in Alzheimer’s Disease [12]) while in
plants APs have roles in senescence, stress responses
and fertilization [13] as well as in defence against pathogens [14]. Reciprocally, APs are deployed by pathogens
to facilitate infection e.g. HIV/AIDS [15], thrush (candidiasis) and malaria [16]. Inhibitors targeted against HIVproteinase are now in widespread use in therapy for
treatment of HIV-infected individuals [17]. Recently it
has been shown that one AP of Plasmodium falciparum
is an ideal target for development of therapeutic inhibitors to treat malaria [18,19]. This AP is responsible for
processing Plasmodium effector proteins in a step that
is crucial for their export into the host red blood cell,
thereby reprogramming the host cell to meet the
demands of the parasite.
With these examples serving to illustrate the reliance
of both host and pathogens on AP activities, it was of
considerable interest to establish and annotate the complement of APs encoded within the three Phytophthora
genomes, particularly since one of the major current
subjects of oomycete research is on effectors that modulate host cell physiology and immune responses. Phytophthora effectors are small, secreted proteins that
undergo translocation into host cells [20] in a manner

analogous to that for the Plasmodium effectors [18,19].
However, the components of the Phytophthora translocation machinery remain to be identified. Here we
describe the complete AP family of three Phytophthora
species and identify some of its members which may
participate in effector translocation.

Results and Discussion
Genome sequences of P. infestans (available through the
Broad Institute website http://www.broadinstitute.org/
annotation/genome/phytophthora_infestans/MultiHome.
html), P. sojae and P. ramorum (from JGI at http://genome.jgi-psf.org/) were analysed for the presence of genes
encoding putative pepsin-like aspartic proteinases as
described in the Methods. Pepsin-like APs from family
A01 are typically produced in the form of a precursor,
consisting of a signal peptide followed by a propart
region that has to be excised from the zymogen polypeptide chain in order to generate the mature enzyme.
The mature enzyme region consists of two homologous
catalytic domains, each of which provides a catalytic
Asp residue to the active site [11,21]. Each Asp residue
is located within the hallmark motif Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly,
which is followed by a hydrophobic-hydrophobic-Gly
sequence, as exemplified by the family patriarch, pig
pepsin (Additional File 1). Together, these motifs form a
structural feature known as a psi loop [22]. A Tyr residue is located at position 75 (pepsin numbering) in a bhairpin loop which overlies the active site. This residue
is strictly conserved in all active pepsin-like APs and
serves as a landmark residue that can be anticipated to
be present in newly-identified AP sequences. A number
of other motifs and landmark residues (including Trp 39
and several intramolecular disulphide bonds - Additional
File 1) are present at characteristic locations along A01
family member polypeptides.
A total of 11 predicted protein sequences exhibiting
some or all of these hallmark features and landmark residues were identified in P. infestans, with 12 and 14
entries detected in P. sojae and P. ramorum, respectively.
Inspection of the sequences revealed that, in P. ramorum,
gene model Pr_73565 was erroneous due to incorrect
assembly of the DNA sequence in this region and gene
model Pr_84645, present in a correctly assembled
sequence, was a pseudogene lacking at least 250 residues
of the N-terminus of a functional AP. In P. sojae, the
sequence encoded by gene Ps_129567 was highly similar
to APs but the two hallmark Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly motifs
were replaced by Asp-Val-Met and Phe-Thr-Met respectively, such that the encoded protein could not possibly
be active. This entry, which lacked an orthologue in both
P. infestans and P. ramorum, was thus considered also to
be a pseudogene. The above three gene models were thus
excluded from further analyses.

HM588685 and HM588686, respectively. For all gene
models, the intron positions were verified by inspection of EST information, if available, and by comparison with DNA sequences of the orthologous gene in
the other two species for the presence or absence of
possible splice junctions at the equivalent nucleotide
position(s). The corrected gene models and their
encoded polypeptides are summarised in Table 2. All
corrections proposed for the P. infestans gene models
were confirmed by available EST data or by cloning
and sequencing the cDNA. Two of the three proposed
corrected gene models for P. sojae (Ps_157552,
Ps_158877) were confirmed by cloning and sequencing the cDNA, while for the third (Ps_135764), correction could not be confirmed as cDNA amplification
was unsuccessful. Corrections in P. ramorum gene
models were not experimentally validated as this species has a quarantine status. An initial insight into the
expression patterns of these APs was obtained from
microarray analysis of P. infestans genes using the
genome-wide NimbleGen array [4]. Consistent levels
of expression were observed for each of the eleven
PiAP genes during culture on different agar media
and during infection on potato (Additional File 3).
The final protein sequences predicted for each of the 34
APs from the three Phytophthora species are listed individually in Additional File 4. Each of these sets of orthologous polypeptides was examined for the presence/
absence of a signal peptide and a propart segment preceding the mature enzyme region. These features are
summarised in Table 3. The individual signal peptide/
propart segment sequences for each of the 12 sets of
orthologues are aligned in Additional File 5. In order to

The remaining 34 genes were the only ones consistently identified by repeated search using PSI-Blast
[23] or HMMer [24], so that it would appear no
further AP homologues are present within these three
genomes. These 34 gene models were analysed (Table
1) and are further discussed in groups on the basis of
orthology. Comparison of the orthologues from the
three species revealed in a number of cases that the
gene models, as originally annotated (Table 1), were
likely to be incorrect. The wealth of information available on pepsin-like AP sequences (http://merops.sanger.ac.uk) including the hallmark motifs/landmark
residues described above, was applied together with
available EST and trace file data, to guide the final
gene predictions for putative APs encoded in the
three Phytophthora genomes. Additional File 2 lists
the gene models that required correction. More than
half of the original gene models annotated in the P.
sojae and P. ramorum databases were correct, whilst
almost all of the original entries for P. infestans were
erroneous. The annotation errors that were identified
(Additional File 2) included mis-identification (i) of
the initiator Met residue, (ii) of intron presence/
absence, (iii) of the 5’ and/or 3’ splice junctions of
introns as well as (iv) sequence trace mis-reads or (v)
trace mis-usage in assembly of the P. infestans
sequence due to heterozygosity. Annotation errors in
two P. infestans genes due to sequencing related
issues were corrected by re-examination of original
sequence trace files at NCBI and by re-sequencing
relevant regions. The corrected nucleotide sequences
of these genes (PITG_08190 and PITG_09387) are
deposited in NCBI under accession numbers

PxAP1-12 were assigned to each of these sets of
orthologues.
Except for PxAP1, the polypeptides continued beyond the
conventional location of the C-terminus of an archetypal
AP, as defined by the reference standard, pig pepsin (Additional File 1). Each of the PxAP2 - PxAP12 polypeptides
thus contained a C-terminal extension (Table 3). These
extensions differed markedly in length and sequence
(Additional File 6) and could only be aligned with the
sequences of their orthologue(s) from the other Phytophthora species, and not with any other sequence in the
set of entries or with any archetypal AP. Only short extensions were present in the PsAP3 and PrAP3 polypeptides
(Additional File 6). The C-terminal extensions for PxAP2
and PxAP4 - PxAP12 were considerably longer and all

contained at least one stretch of approximately 20 consecutive hydrophobic residues (marked in Additional File 6
by a box) which are predicted to provide a membranespanning segment. Thus, almost all the Phytophthora APs
(PxAP2 and PxAP4 - PxAP12) are predicted to be membrane-bound enzymes. While it is not uncommon for individual APs from other species to be membrane-anchored
in such a fashion (e.g. human BACE, plasmepsin V from
Plasmodium falciparum), it is unprecedented for almost
the entire AP complement of an organism to appear to be
membrane-bound enzymes. Considerable experimental
effort will need to be invested to establish whether all of
these predicted polypeptides are indeed membrane-associated but in previous investigations, APs that have been
predicted to contain a membrane-associated segment have
always been proven by subsequent experimental investigations to be membrane-attached. Further consideration will
be given to this aspect for the individual cases described
below.
The sequences of the mature enzyme regions of each of
the 12 sets of orthologues from the three Phytophthora
species were aligned and a phylogenetic tree was generated (Figure 1). This resolved the PxAP1-12 sequences
into five clades that are related to well-documented APs
from other species. Each Phytophthora species is thus
equipped with an AP gene family, the members of which
have distinct gene organisations (Table 3) and encode
polypeptides with considerably different sequences
(Figures 2, 3, 4, 5) and, potentially, distinct activities.
Each of the clades will be considered in turn.

by orthologous single exon genes (Table 2). The PxAP1
polypeptides (Table 3) display all of the essential components i.e. signal peptide, propart segment (Additional
File 4) and two-domain mature enzyme region (Figure
2), including all the necessary hallmark motifs and residues of archetypal pepsin-like APs described earlier
(Additional File 1). These polypeptides are not extended
at their C-terminus. The phylogenetic analysis revealed
that the three PxAP1 polypeptides cluster closely with
fungal APs (Figure 1) that are known to be located in
the vacuole of the cell. This subfamily, with saccharopepsin from S. cerevisiae as the parent member, is
assigned the identifier A01.018 in the MEROPS database. Analyses of all sequenced fungal genomes has
revealed that the only AP that is omnipresent is the
vacuolar enzyme [25]. Thus, it seems likely that PiAP1,
PsAP1 and PrAP1 are the respective vacuolar APs from
each Phytophthora species. PiAP1 has been produced in
recombinant form and shown to have AP activity on
haemoglobin (F. Govers, Wageningen University, personal communication).

The polypeptides of the PxAP2 in clade 2 (Figure 1)
are atypical in that they do not contain a signal peptide or a non-classical secretion signal (Table 3 and
Additional File 5). This is highly unusual in APs
although precedents have been observed in fungi
including Botrytis cinerea [25] and in bacterial species
of marine origin [26]. It is not obvious how these polypeptides are able to become incorporated into a membrane through the (single) hydrophobic segment in
their C-terminal extensions (Additional File 6) when
there is no signal peptide to mediate transfer into the
endoplasmic reticulum. Experiments using fusion constructs with reporter proteins will be necessary to
resolve this conundrum.
Within clade 3, five clusters (PxAP3 - PxAP7) were
resolved from one another (Figure 1). More profound
phylogenetic analysis (not shown) indicates that this
clade forms a monophyletic clade with three entries
from two filamentous fungi, i.e. the zygomycetes Rhizopus oryzae and Phycomyces blakesleeanus. PxAP3encoding genes were only detected in P. sojae and P.
ramorum (gene models Ps_157552 and Pr_77872; Table
1, Table 2). Despite repeated searching, an orthologue of
these two in P. infestans could not be detected. The
PxAP3 genes are located in regions of co-linearity. Scrutiny of the five flanking genes (upstream and downstream) in the P. sojae and P. ramorum genomes
revealed that orthologues are present in similar arrangement in P. infestans DNA, however, on separate contigs.
The gap between the contigs corresponds to the likely
location of the “missing” AP gene. Moreover, no unassembled reads were identified in P. infestans that
matched PsAP3 or PrAP3 sequences.
The originally-annotated gene models for Ps_157552
and Pr_77872 both required considerable correction
(Additional Files 2 and 4). The 5’-splice donor site of
the third intron in Ps_157552 was identified to be a GC
dinucleotide sequence. This dinucleotide has been found
to be used as the 5’-donor junction at low frequency (~
1%) in a number of fungi [27] but no information is
available as yet on its use in oomycetes. The amendments to the Ps_157552 and Pr_77872 gene models
(Additional Files 2 and 4) resulted in predicted polypeptide sequences that contained both signal peptide and
propart segments (Table 3; Additional File 5). The
sequences of the mature enzyme regions (Figure 3)
showed a pairwise identity of 71%. Both polypeptides
contained all three of the disulphide bonds that are
common in vertebrate APs and they were only slightly
extended at their C-terminal end relative to pepsin
(Additional File 6). PsAP3 and PrAP3 can be predicted
to display different substrate specificities. The region
between residues 292 and 298 is known conventionally
as the “polyproline loop” and has been demonstrated to

Figure 2 Alignment of the mature enzyme regions of PxAP1 and PxAP2 predicted polypeptides with pig pepsin. The numbering system
is that of pig pepsin (PepA_PIG) and the vacuolar enzymes from S. cerevisiae (ScPEP4p) and N. crassa (NcPEP4) are included for comparison. The
DT/SG and hydrophobic-hydrophobic-Gly motifs forming the psi loops in each domain are boxed, as are the landmark residues Y75 and W39.
The Cys residues contributing the three disulphide bonds common to vertebrate APs such as pig pepsin, are shaded and their pairing is
indicated by thick ( ) black lines. Gaps introduced to optimise the alignment are indicated by a hyphen.

be a major determinant for substrate specificity [22]. In
PrAP3, the sequence LGDDLYW of this region has two
extra (LY) residues compared to the LSDD–W sequence
of PsAP3 (dashed box in Figure 3). The presence of
these two hydrophobic residues is likely to influence
specificity.
Like PxAP3, the PxAP4 and PxAP5 polypeptides from
Phytophthora contained the conventional AP segments
of a signal peptide and propart (Table 3; Additional File
5), prior to the mature enzyme region (Figure 3). Each
trio of polypeptides was also extended at its C-terminus
but, whereas the extensions in PxAP4 consisted of 136138 residues with one putative membrane-spanning
stretch, the PxAP5 extensions were substantially longer
(Additional File 6). Indeed, the C-terminal extensions in
PiAP5 (322 residues) and its orthologues encompassed
no less than seven potential transmembrane segments

(Additional File 6), an architecture highly reminiscent of
the seven transmembrane stretches that constitute the
super-family of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR)
[28]. Blast search using the sequence of the C-terminal
extension of PiAP5 as query, identified the first non-self
hit (with an E-value of 0.001) as RpkA, a G-protein
coupled receptor family protein from Dictyostelium discoideum [29]. A 55.5% similarity in a 265 amino acid
overlap was calculated between the two sequences using
Smith-Waterman analysis [30]. The intriguing possibility
thus arises that, in Phytophthora species, a fusion protein is produced in which the N-terminal partner is an
AP connected to a putative GPCR as the C-terminal
component. Self-processing to release the AP component would generate the mature GPCR. Such a self-processing phenomenon is unprecedented, although
receptors activated by extrinsic proteinases are well-

Figure 4 Alignment of the mature enzyme regions of PxAP8 and PxAP9 predicted polypeptides with human BACE (Hs_BACE1) and
BACE2 (Hs_BACE2). The numbering system is that of pig pepsin. The DT/SG and hydrophobic-hydrophobic-Gly motifs forming the psi loops in
each domain are boxed. Landmark residues 75 and 39 are boxed as in previous figures, but here to emphasise the Y75F and W39A
replacements (highlighted black). Residue 80 is also boxed to indicate the presence of a W residue at this location in PxAP8 and BACE/BACE2.
The Cys residues contributing the three disulphide bonds in BACE are shaded and their known pairing is indicated by thick ( ) and dotted
black lines ( ).

documented [31]. Further investigations into the Phytophthora AP-GPCR fusion-proteins would appear to be
well-merited.
The final two sub-groups that were resolved within
clade 3 consisted of PxAP6 and PxAP7 (Figure 1). No
orthologue was detected in P. sojae for the proteins PiAP7
and PrAP7, encoded by PITG_05004 and Pr_73546 (Table
1; Table 2). The PiAP7- and PrAP7-encoding genes are
located in co-linear orthologous regions of the P. infestans
and P. ramorum genomes, as confirmed by the organization of flanking genes. In P. sojae, the corresponding

genomic region had a similar co-linearity arrangement
with the exception of two missing genes, one of them in
the region where an orthologous AP-encoding gene
should have been located. Moreover, no unassembled
reads were identified in P. sojae that matched the PiAP7
or PrAP7 sequences. The simplest interpretation is that an
ancestor of the PxAP7-encoding gene was present in Phytophthora, and deletion of the region resulted in loss of
the orthologue in P. sojae, although it cannot be excluded
that substitutions have accumulated to an extent that prevents recognition of the gene.

The PxAP6 and PxAP7 polypeptides showed an unusual variation in the component segments that constitute an archetypal AP in that a propart was absent
(Table 3). In each case, the signal peptide (Additional
File 5) immediately precedes the mature enzyme region
(Figure 3) which, in turn, is followed by a C-terminal
extension (Additional File 6). As stated above, almost all
pepsin-like APs are synthesised in the form of a precursor. The propart segment makes a number of essential
contributions, such as ensuring proper folding and intracellular sorting of the zymogen polypeptide, and facilitation of its activation into the mature enzyme form upon
encountering the appropriate conditions [11,32]. Very
recently, however, APs lacking a propart segment have
been described from marine bacteria [26] and fungi
[25], hence this unusual architecture of the PxAP6 and
PxAP7 polypeptides in Phytophthora species is not without precedent.
BACE-like Aspartic Proteinases

The PxAP8 and PxAP9 polypeptides were resolved by
the phylogenetic analysis into clade 4 (Figure 1). These
polypeptides also contained a signal peptide (Additional
File 5), the mature enzyme region (Figure 4) and a Cterminal extension (Additional File 6) but they too
lacked a propart (Table 3 and Additional File 5), just
like PxAP6 and PxAP7.
The phylogenetic analysis (Figure 1) revealed that these
proteins cluster within clade 4 with human BACE and its
paralogue, BACE2 (sub-families A01.004/041 in the MEROPS database). The mature enzyme forms of BACE/
BACE2 are initially synthesised in precursor forms that do
contain propart segments. While the presence of the propart has little effect on the intrinsic proteolytic activity, its
inclusion at the N-terminus of proBACE/proBACE2
ensures much more rapid folding of the polypeptide(s)
than is observed when only the mature forms of each
enzyme are produced [[33,34] and references therein].
BACE and BACE2 were among the first APs to be
identified as having a C-terminal extension which
ensured they were membrane-bound. The mature
enzyme regions (Figure 4) have hallmark features which
distinguish A01.004/041 subfamily members from classical APs such as pepsin. Among these are: (i) the highlyconserved Trp39 (see Figures 2 and 3) is replaced by
Ala and is itself relocated to a position (residue 80) just
downstream from the essential Tyr75 residue on the bhairpin loop that overhangs the active site cleft (see
Background), (ii) disulphide bonds in characteristic locations that increase stability of the polypeptide. These
additional Cys residues and the Trp39Ala replacement
are all present in PxAP8 and PxAP9 proteins (Figure 4).
BACE has been identified as the b-site Alzheimer’s
Precursor Protein (APP) Cleaving Enzyme (or b-

Page 10 of 15

secretase) responsible for the cleavage that generates the
free N-terminal end of the Ab peptide which plays a
central role in Alzheimer’s disease [35]. For almost a
decade, BACE has been the target of intense efforts to
develop inhibitors to alleviate the dementia of Alzheimer’s disease. Genes encoding BACE and its paralogue,
BACE2, have been identified in species ranging from
humans through elephant, opossum, armadillo, hedgehog, shrew, and fish, to platypus (http://www.merops.ac.
uk). To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the identification of PxAP8-encoding genes from three Phytophthora species provides the first indication that
BACE-like, membrane-bound APs may not be limited to
the vertebrates. Intriguingly, the Phytophthora genomes
also contain genes encoding homologues of presenilin,
nicastrin, anterior pharynx defective-1(APH-1) and presenilin enhancer-2 (PEN-2) (although some gene models
require substantial correction; not shown). These are all
components of the human g-secretase complex which
completes the proteolytic processing by releasing the Ab
peptide at its C-terminal end from the Alzheimer’s Precursor polypeptide [36]. The presence of both b- and gsecretase gene products in microbes such as Phytophthora suggests that their function is not limited to
the processing of a brain polypeptide related to Alzheimer’s disease. These proteins therefore seem to be very
ancient features that are conserved between oomycetes
and vertebrates, and they have been coopted in vertebrate species to cleave the brain APP polypeptide.
While the PxAP8 polypeptides exhibited the hallmark
characteristics of BACE/BACE2 subfamily members, the
PxAP9 proteins lacked one feature that is necessary for
an AP to be active as an enzyme. The Tyr residue
located at position 75 (pig pepsin numbering) is conserved in every pepsin-like AP that is known to be
active, although it does not participate directly in the
catalytic mechanism [11,21]. In PxAP9, this Tyr residue
is replaced by Phe (Figure 4) so the catalytic activity can
be postulated to be compromised, at best. A protein
engineering study revealed that the replacement of
Tyr75 in a fungal AP by Asn or Phe permitted activity,
albeit at a considerably reduced level, while all other
replacements abolished activity [37]. However, a number
of catalytically-inactive APs have been reported previously, including the pregnancy-associated glycoproteins (PAGs) found in the placenta of ungulates
(subfamily A01.971 in MEROPS) [38] and perhaps most
notably, the Bla g2 protein (subfamily A01.950 in MEROPS) which is a predominant allergen from cockroach
[39]. The crystal structure of Bla g2 shows that it has
the fold and three-dimensional structure typical of pepsin-like APs [40]. Bla g2 and the PAGs from Ovis aries
and Capra hircus all have a Phe residue at position 75.
These three proteins have additional substitutions at the

Kay et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:254
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/254

two active site DT/SG motifs, cementing their catalytic
inactivity. Their function has been postulated to include
roles in peptide-binding and presentation, but without
cleavage. If PxAP9 should also prove to be catalytically
ineffective, the active site will still be accessible for the
binding of peptides that cannot undergo cleavage and so
a role similar to the PAGs/Bla g2 in peptide binding
might be feasible. This intriguing possibility is rendered
all the more fascinating with the realisation that, in contrast to the PAGs/Bla g2, these Phytophthora orthologues are likely to be membrane-bound through their Cterminal extensions (Additional File 6) and might function as a novel type of surface receptor. In this regard, it
may well be noteworthy that the putative intracellular
domain comprised of the residues downstream from the
transmembrane segment in the C-terminal extension in
PxAP9 is considerably longer than its PxAP8 counterpart (Additional File 6). Neither of the C-terminal
extensions, however, contains a discernible Pfam domain
or protein motif. Thus, all three Phytophthora species
may produce one catalytically-active BACE-like enzyme
(PxAP8) and one peptide-binding, membrane-bound
enzymatically inactive paralogue with an intracellular
extension of unknown function (PxAP9).
Nepenthesin-like Aspartic Proteinases (MEROPS subfamily
A1B)

The remaining three AP genes in each Phytophthora
genome (Table 2), encoding polypeptides PxAP10,
PxAP11 and PxAP12 cluster into clade 5 with representative APs from MEROPS subfamily A1B including the
patriarch of plant origin, nepenthesin, and plasmepsin V
from Plasmodium falciparum (Figure 1). The PxAP10 12 polypeptides contrast with their PxAP6 - 9 counterparts in having the archetypal AP architecture of a signal peptide followed by a propart (Additional File 5), a
mature enzyme region (Figure 5), terminating with Cterminal extensions (Additional File 6). PxAP10 - 12 differed, however, from all of the other Phytophthora APs
(PxAP1 - 9) in having a small extra segment inserted
(dotted box in Figure 5) in the region just upstream
from Tyr75 (in pig pepsin numbering). No less than
seven Cys residues are present between residues 39 - 75,
with a further three Cys residues (shaded in Figure 5)
conserved at characteristic locations elsewhere in the
mature enzyme regions of the nine Phytophthora APs in
clade 5. Together, these Cys residues are likely to form
five specific disulphide bridges, paired as indicated in
Figure 5. This arrangement of disulphide bridges has
been deduced from biochemical analyses of the APs of
plant origin [41,42] that cluster with PxAP10 - 12 in
clade 5. Indeed, most of the APs in plants [43] contain
these Cys residues as well as the insert and they are
grouped into subfamily A1B in the MEROPS database.

Page 11 of 15

The plant APs identified in clade 5 are readily distinguished on the basis of their functional activity from
one another and from others that are not included here
for the sake of brevity, such as the nucellins (subfamily
A01.073), regulators of the degradation of nucellar cells
after ovule fertilisation [44], and the Chloroplast
Nucleoids DNA-binding (CND41) proteinase (subfamily
A01.050) which catalyses the degradation of RUBISCO
in senescent leaves [45]. Nepenthesins (A01.040 subfamily) are extracellular enzymes secreted by the carnivorous plant, Nepenthes, to digest its prey [41] while CDR1
of Arabidopsis plays a crucial role in activating resistance of Arabidopsis against microbial pathogens [14].
Overexpression of CDR1 leads to constitutive disease
resistance, while gene silencing compromises resistance.
The CDR1 gene product is suggested to release an as
yet unidentified peptide that activates a signalling cascade to induce disease resistance in a salicylate-dependent manner [14]. Recombinant CDR1 protein has been
produced in E. coli and shown to be active as an AP in
a dimeric form [42]. Two intermolecular disulphide
bonds were proposed to be responsible for the covalent
association of the two polypeptide chains in the proteolytically-active homodimer [42]. The Cys residues
involved in the homodimer formation are highlighted in
Figure 5 by a star ( ). Cys residues are present at identical locations within PxAP10 (Figure 5), suggesting that
this enzyme may also function as a homodimer. In contrast, PxAP11 is devoid of cysteine residues in this
region and so, based on this criterion, should function
as a monomer. PxAP12 does contain two cysteine residues but at different positions within this region of the
polypeptide (Figure 5). Whether these remain as free
cysteines or are involved in disulphide bonds, intra- or
inter-molecular, requires experimental investigation.
One feature does serve to distinguish between the
plant APs and the nine PxAP10 - 12 polypeptides clustered in clade 5 (Figure 1). Most plant APs do not have
C-terminal extensions (with NP_199124 from Arabidopsis included in Figure 1 as one of few exceptions). In
contrast, all nine of the oomycete PxAP10 - 12 polypeptides do have C-terminal extensions, ensuring that all
are membrane-bound enzymes (Additional File 6).
In addition to plant APs, plasmepsin V was resolved into
clade 5 (Figure 1) as the entry most closely associated with
the PxAP10 - 12 polypeptides. Plasmepsin V is one of ten
APs encoded within the genome of Plasmodium falciparum [16], the causative agent of malaria. This enzyme
(Figure 5) has a C-terminal extension with a hydrophobic
stretch (not shown) that results in its anchoring as a membrane-bound polypeptide [46]. Very recently, plasmepsin
V has been demonstrated to be the (aspartic) proteinase
responsible for processing the precursors of Plasmodium
effector proteins at the PEXEL motif (RxLxE/Q); this step

Kay et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:254
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/254

is essential for the translocation of these polypeptides into
the host red blood cell [18,19]. The malaria parasite
exports hundreds of such effector proteins across the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane into the human red blood
cell, thereby reprogramming the host cell to meet the
needs of the parasite. Plasmepsin V is conserved in Plasmodium species but is not produced in vertebrates susceptible to parasitic infection and thus serves as a target
enzyme against which to develop inhibitors as novel therapeutic agents for treatment of malaria.
Intriguingly, Phytophthora species also secrete effector
proteins that are important in modulating host defence
and cell death mechanisms and many such effector proteins contain the internal sequence motif RxLR, similar
to the Plasmodium PEXEL motif [8,47,48]. Phytophthora
effector proteins are secreted after removal of their signal peptide, giving rise to a polypeptide that contains in
its N-terminal region the RxLR-containing domain
which is essential for subsequent delivery into the plant
cell [47-50]. It is tempting to consider that a Phytophthora effector precursor might undergo further processing to remove the RxLR domain, thereby releasing
the mature, biologically active effector domain. The
similarities described above between plasmepsin V and
its PxAP10, PxAP11 and PxAP12 orthologues in Phytophthora suggests a conserved biological role. By analogy to the role of plasmepsin V in processing of
Plasmodium effector proteins [18,19], one or more of its
Phytophthora orthologues may reside in the translocon
and act in the processing of Phytophthora effector precursors. There are obvious structural and genetic differences between the secretion mechanisms of the two
parasites. The genome sequences of Phytophthora species lack genes homologous to the translocon complex
components identified in Plasmodium [51]. Nevertheless, our hypothesis invites experimental investigation
into targeting these particular APs in Phytophthora as a
pathogenic Achilles heel through which the devastating
losses from infection by Phytophthora might be reduced.

Conclusions
One of the twelve pepsin-like APs encoded within the
genomes of the three Phytophthora species is predicted to
be produced as an unprecedented fusion protein with a
putative G-protein coupled receptor as the C-terminal
partner. The other APs appear to be related to existing
enzymes from other species that have already been documented. These include the vacuolar enzyme, and somewhat more unexpectedly, BACE/BACE2-like APs in an
active and likely inactive form akin to the Bla g2/PAG proteins, and plasmepsin V-like enzymes. Whether the latter
are functional homologs of their Plasmodium counterpart,
operating in the processing of RxLR-type effector proteins
during transit to the plant cell, would appear to be worthy

of immediate experimental investigation given the high
level of current interest in this topic. Elucidation of the
physiological roles of the APs identified here offers highly
fertile areas ripe for examination. The significant revision
of the erroneous gene models and the detailed annotation
presented here should be highly beneficial in facilitating
future experimental design.

Methods
Data sources and analyses

Sequence data of Phytophthora infestans were retrieved
from the Broad Institute website (http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/genome/phytophthora_infestans/
MultiHome.html). Sequence data of P. sojae and P.
ramorum were retrieved from the website of the DOE
Joint Genome Institute (http://genome.jgi-psf.org/). In
cases where errors were suspected in P. infestans DNA
sequences (gene models PITG_08190 and PITG_09837),
the original trace files at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
Traces/home/ were analyzed in more detail. In all cases
the expected errors could be confirmed by analysing the
trace representing the two alleles of the genes in P. infestans strain T30-4. The sequence error was further validated by amplification of the entire coding sequence of
the genes from T30-4 genomic DNA using specific primers (underlined) linked to standard sequencing primers:
08190F1: 5’-TTTAGTGAACCGTCAGATCCGTTA
AGTCAGCACGTTGTAATC-3’;
08190F2: 5’-TTTAGTGAACCGTCAGATCAGTGCTGATGGACTGGCAAAC-3’;
08190R1:
5’-AACAGCTCCTCGCCCTTGGGAGATGGTCAGTCCTGGTAG-3’;
08190R2: 5’-AACAGCTCCTCGCCCTTGATGGTA
CTGTCCGACTAGTTG-3’
09387F: 5’-TTTAGTGAACCGTCAGATCATGATG
CTGCGCTGCTCCGTC-3’;
09387R: 5’-AACAGCTCCTCGCCCTTGCATACAGTCACCATCTTCACC-3’.
The PCR products were purified and subsequently
sequenced (Macrogen, Amsterdam, The Netherlands).
The corrected nucleotide sequences were deposited in
NCBI (PITG_09387 = PiAP1: HM588685; PITG_08190
= PiAP8: HM588686).
Expression of the eleven P. infestans AP genes was
determined from analysis of the data derived from the
NimbleGen microarray (Accession Number GSE14480),
as described previously [4].
Identification of Phytophthora APs by PSI-Blast and
HMMer profile alignment

A first HMMer search [24] was performed with default
cut-off values of 10 using a profile based on the reference holozyme sequence set as provided by MEROPS. A
second HMMer search was done with a profile that we

Kay et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:254
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/254

generated based on over 5000 AP sequences identified
by NCBI Entrez and verified by MEROPS batch analysis
[52]. PSI-Blast was performed, using cut-off values of
10, with the PiAP1, PiAP8 and PiAP10 as queries
against the NR database restricted to the taxid Phytophthora (which includes the complete proteome
sequences of P. infestans but not of P. sojae or P.
ramorum) using a Position Specific Substitution Matrix
obtained by converging PSI-blast against the Swissprot
database. PSSM generation using NR or Refseq databases failed due to high contamination in the first Blast
iteration using the Blosum62 substitution matrix.
Protein sequence analyses

Once the open reading frames of relevant gene entries
were established, the resulting protein sequences were
analysed in various ways. The mature enzyme region
was determined by using the Pfam protein families database [53]. The SignalP server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/
services/SignalP/) was used to predict the signal peptidase cleavage site and the absence of non-classical
secretion signals in the PxAP2 sequences was verified
using the SecretomeP server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SecretomeP/). The cleavage site between propart
and mature enzyme region was predicted from detailed
inspection of the sequences. The prediction of transmembrane domains was performed using the web-tools
ConPred II [54] or TMHMM Server (http://www.cbs.
dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/) [55]. GPCR relationship was
analysed by PRED-GPCR (http://athina.biol.uoa.gr/bioinformatics/PRED-GPCR/) [56].
Sequence alignments in Figures 2, 3, 4 and 5 were
essentially prepared using T-Coffee [57] at the EBI server (http://www.ebi.ac.uk), and manually adjusted in a
limited number of places to better align structural features that are hallmarks of APs.
Phylogeny

The alignments shown in Figures 2, 3, 4 and 5 were combined using T-Coffee [57] with manual corrections. Nonhomologous N- and C-terminal sequences were removed.
A maximum likelihood (ML) tree was made using PHYML
[58]. Bootstrap analysis was performed by combining the
“seqboot” and “consense” commands from PHYLIP [59]
and the ML algorithm from PHYML. Trees were analyzed
using Dendroscope [60]. Bootstrap analysis indicated poor
resolution of the PxAP2 clade. In order to improve the
resolution of this clade we included the sequence of
human gastricsin which was the first non-self hit detected
in a Blast analysis using PiAP2 as a query. Similarly, in
order to improve the resolution between Plasmepsin V and
the PxAP10-12 clade, the sequence XP_002180775 from
Phaeodactylum tricornutum (from the sister phylum of diatoms) was included in the phylogeny.

characteristic motifs and features of Aspartic Proteinases. The DTG
and hydrophobic-hydrophobic-Gly motifs forming the psi loops in each
domain are boxed, as are the landmark residues Tyr75 and Trp39. The
Cys residues contributing the three disulphide bonds are shaded and
their pairing is indicated by thick ( ) black lines.
Additional file 2: Corrections made to erroneous Phytophthora
Aspartic Proteinase gene models (as represented in databases in
January 2010).
Additional file 3: Gene expression analysis of P. infestans AP genes
by NimbleGen microarray. Samples used in the hybridization were
isolated from P. infestans grown in vitro on three different agar types
(pea agar, V8 juice agar rye sucrose agar) or from P. infestans-inoculated
potato leaves at 2, 3, 4 and 5 days post inoculation. Details of the
experimental procedures of the microarray analysis are provided in [4].
Values +/- SD are the averages from two independent experiments.
Additional file 4: Corrected Phytophthora Aspartic Proteinase gene
models. Predicted protein sequences of Phytophthora Aspartic
Proteinases PxAP1-12. Bold characters represent the predicted signal
peptide. Underlined characters represent the predicted propart segment.
Italic characters represent the C-terminal extension. Non-bold, nonunderlined, non-italic characters depict the mature enzyme region.
Amino acids marked in yellow are the residues added to the protein
sequence as a result of the revision of the gene models listed in Table 1.
For each entry, the database accession number for the gene is given,
followed by our allocated identifier (in parentheses) for the encoded
polypeptide. The corrected gene models for P. infestans genes PiAP2,
PiAP4, PiAP6, PiAP7, PiAP9, PiAP11 and PiAP12 have been implemented
in the Broad Institute database (October 2010). Gene models for PiAP1
and PiAP8 in the Broad Institute database were not corrected because
these genes contain sequencing errors. The correct gene models for
PiAP1 and PiAP8 can be retrieved from NCBI accession number
HM588685 and HM588686. The corrected gene models for P. sojae genes
PsAP3, PsAP9, PsAP11 and for P. ramorum genes PrAP3, PrAP8, PrAP10
and PrAP11 have not yet been implemented in the JGI databases (Apil
2011).
Additional file 5: Signal peptides and propart segments at the Nterminal end of the mature enzyme regions of PxAP1-12. Gaps were
introduced to optimize alignment. Each signal peptide and propart
segment is spatially separated and marked by the respective boxes at
the top. The lack of a signal peptide or propart segment in individual
polypeptides is indicated by ———— none —————.
Additional file 6: Alignment in orthologous sets of the extensions
at the C-terminal ends of the mature enzyme regions of PxAP2 - 12
detailed in Figures 2, 3, 4, 5. Gaps were introduced to optimize
alignment. Hydrophobic residues contributing potential membranespanning stretches are boxed.

List of Abbreviations
Aspartic proteinase (AP) genes are listed according to their identifiers (e.g.
PITG, Ps or Pr) in the respective genome databases. The encoded
polypeptides are identified as PiAP, PsAP or PrAP with a number. The
generic descriptor PxAP with a number is used to simplify the description of
any one sub-group of AP polypeptides from all three species.
