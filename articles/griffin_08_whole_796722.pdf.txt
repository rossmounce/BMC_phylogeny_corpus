Abstract
Background: Comparative genomics is a powerful means of establishing inter-specific relationships between
gene function/location and allows insight into genomic rearrangements, conservation and evolutionary phylogeny.
The availability of the complete sequence of the chicken genome has initiated the development of detailed
genomic information in other birds including turkey, an agriculturally important species where mapping has
hitherto focused on linkage with limited physical information. No molecular study has yet examined conservation
of avian microchromosomes, nor differences in copy number variants (CNVs) between birds.
Results: We present a detailed comparative cytogenetic map between chicken and turkey based on reciprocal
chromosome painting and mapping of 338 chicken BACs to turkey metaphases. Two inter-chromosomal changes
(both involving centromeres) and three pericentric inversions have been identified between chicken and turkey;
and array CGH identified 16 inter-specific CNVs.
Conclusion: This is the first study to combine the modalities of zoo-FISH and array CGH between different avian
species. The first insight into the conservation of microchromosomes, the first comparative cytogenetic map of
any bird and the first appraisal of CNVs between birds is provided. Results suggest that avian genomes have
remained relatively stable during evolution compared to mammalian equivalents.

Background
Comparative genomics is a powerful means for establishing relationships between gene function and location in a
range of organisms. Moreover it allows insight into largescale genomic rearrangements, conservation of functional
elements and tracing of evolutionary phylogenies through
the examination of both closely and distantly related species. The completion of the chicken (Gallus gallus, GGA)
genome [1] and its associated resources provide the basis
for the rapid development of detailed genomic information, potentially in all other birds. The most powerful
strategies combine in-silico and experimental approaches,
e.g. sequence comparison, cross-species fluorescent in-situ
hybridization (zoo-FISH) [2,3] and, more recently, the
use of whole-genome tiling path microarrays for crossspecies array comparative genomic hybridization (array
CGH) [4-8]. Such a combination of modalities provides
information on gross genomic rearrangements, gene
gains/losses, copy number variation and gene order.
Following the completion of the chicken genome
sequence assembly [1], one of the most obvious targets for
comparative genomics in birds is the turkey (Meleagris gallopavo, MGA). Turkey is an agriculturally important species accounting for over 4.5 million tonnes of meat
consumed per year worldwide, with the obvious cultural
associations such as Christmas and Thanksgiving. Genetic
mapping efforts in the turkey have focused on linkage
mapping [9-13] and the physical information available is
very limited. With 2n = 78 in the chicken and 2n = 80 in
the turkey, about 10 pairs of macro- and 28–30 pairs of
microchromosomes in both species, the karyotypes of
chicken and turkey are quite similar to the hypothetical
ancestral Galliform karyotype [14]. Chromosome banding and zoo-FISH with chromosome paints for chicken
chromosomes GGA1–9 and Z in a range of Galliform species have suggested that chicken and turkey karyotypes are
distinguished by at least two interchromosomal rearrangements [15,16]. That is, the orthologues of chicken
chromosomes GGA2 and 4 are represented by turkey
chromosomes MGA3 & 6, and 4 & 9 respectively [14].
Comparisons of a series of other Galliformes suggest that
GGA2 is the ancestral form (the acrocentric MGA3 and
MGA6 suggesting a breakpoint in the short arm just above
the centromere). By contrast, the most parsimonious
explanation for the formation of the sub-metacentric
GGA4 suggests a fusion of an ancestral acrocentric chromosome 4 with a smaller chromosome [14]. This fusion
model is supported by sequence evidence which suggests
that GGA4p retains the properties (e.g. high gene density,
high recombination frequency) of the smaller chromosome it once was [1]. The chromosomal break- and fusion
points involved in these rearrangements however have
not been characterized in detail, nor has gene order on
macrochromosomes; moreover no molecular evidence

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/168

has yet been generated regarding synteny between microchromosomes though simple chromosome counts suggest extensive conservation.
To the best of our knowledge, no study has examined
inter-specific differences in copy number variants (CNVs)
between birds. CNVs are defined as copy number changes
involving DNA fragments that are ~1 kb or larger [17],
with the exception of insertions or deletions of transposable elements [18]. Recent high-resolution, high-throughput techniques for genomic analysis such as array CGH
and quantitative (real-time) PCR as well as in-silico
approaches have revealed a significant contribution of
CNVs to human genetic variation [18,19], and studies in
humans and other primates have suggested an important
role for CNVs in disease-related as well as normal phenotypic variation [18,19] and in evolutionary adaptation [46,20-22]. However, the paucity of data and the almost
exclusive focus on primates preclude any general conclusions about the significance of CNVs in phenotypic variation and evolution; data from other species is therefore
essential.
In this paper, by examination of chicken and turkey
genomes for chromosomal and CNV differences we test
the hypothesis that Galliform genomes have remained relatively stable during ~28 million years of evolution compared to an equivalent period in mammals. To date, this
information has been limited to zoo-FISH of chicken
chromosome paints on other species and partial karyotypes but these early studies do suggest relative stability of
the avian genome compared to the mammalian one. We
thus present a detailed comparative cytogenetic map of
the turkey based on reciprocal zoo-FISH with chicken and
turkey macrochromosome paints, zoo-FISH with chicken
microchromosome paints and single/dual color FISH
mapping of more than 300 chicken BACs to turkey metaphases. In addition, we provide a molecular characterization of inter- and intra-chromosomal rearrangements by
FISH mapping of BACs to chicken metaphase chromosomes, painting of chicken lampbrush chromosomes with
turkey chromosome paints and hybridization of turkey
chromosome paints onto a chicken whole genome tiling
array. Finally, we present comparative data on CNVs in
chicken and turkey, which constitute the first array CGHbased data set on inter-specific differences of CNVs in
birds.

Results
Chromosome painting
Cross-species hybridization of chicken chromosomes
GGA1–13, 18–21 and 24–27 plus the Z chromosome to
turkey metaphases confirmed two inter-chromosomal
rearrangements between the two species. The chromosome paint for GGA2 hybridized to both turkey chromo-

somes MGA3 and 6, while the chromosome paint for
GGA4 hybridized to MGA4 and a smaller chromosome
which banding and ideogram analysis [16] suggest to be
MGA9 (Figure 1). Reciprocal painting of chicken chromosomes with chromosome paints for MGA1–9 and Z confirmed these results and were consistent with both interchromosomal rearrangements involving the centromere
of GGA2 and 4 respectively (Figure 2). Orthology of
GGA4p and MGA9 was also confirmed by comparative
FISH mapping of chicken BACs (see below). Further evidence of centromeric involvement came from the hybridization of chromosome paints for MGA3, 4 and 6 onto
chicken extended lampbrush chromosomes (illustrated
for MGA3 and 6 in Figure 3); hybridization of the MGA9
paint was not successful on lampbrush chromosomes.
The chromosome paint for GGA25 hybridized strongly to
metaphases of both species, however the size of the chromosome painted appeared much larger in turkey than in
chicken. Numerous attempts at cross-species painting for
the remainder of the microchromosomes (GGA28–38)
were not successful and chromosome paints were not
available for chromosomes GGA14–17, 22 and 23.
Single and dual color FISH mapping of BACs
Using single and dual color FISH we successfully mapped
338 BACs in both chicken and turkey (e.g. Figure 4),
approximately 70% of the BACs mapped in chicken also
mapped to turkey. One or more chicken BACs from
GGA1–28 and Z (with the exception of GGA21, 22 and
25) all successfully hybridized to turkey chromosomes.

These experiments confirmed the chromosome painting
results and, in addition, suggested that there were no further inter-chromosomal rearrangements. Three intrachromosomal rearrangements nevertheless were detected:
The centric nature of the breakpoint that led to the evolution of MGA3 and MGA6 and the presence of a small
short arm on MGA3 which contains the BACs identified
by markers MCW0293 and LEI0129 (both of which
hybridize below the centromere in chicken) is consistent
with a pericentric inversion (Figure 5a). Moreover, these
two BACs co-localize with BAC MCW0358 on GGA2 but
are approximately 20% of the chromosome further away
in MGA3 (Figure 5a), again suggesting that a pericentric
inversion is the likely mechanism. For GGA3 and its
orthologue MGA2, the presence of BAC P5A6 above the
centromere in chicken but around one tenth of the way
down chromosome 2 in turkey (and below the centromere) again, provides evidence of a pericentric inversion
(Figure 5b). Finally the presence of BAC MCW0275 near
the middle of MGA10 (an acrocentric chromosome) and
towards the telomere of GGA8 (a metacentric chromosome) gave clear evidence of a third pericentric inversion
(Figure 5c). The FISH mapping data were used to construct a cytogenetic map of the turkey, which have been
uploaded to a publicly available database on the ArkDB
browser [23]. Chromosome painting and BAC mapping
data for the microchromosomes are summarized in Table
1.

breakpoint is centromeric.

As mentioned above, chromosome painting experiments
suggest centromeric breakpoint/fusion points in GGA2
and GGA4. This was confirmed by systematic FISH mapping of a further 108 BACs to GGA2 and 4 and MGA3, 6,
4 and 9. Of these BACs, 51 were on GGA2p and MGA6, 18
were on GGA2q and MGA3, 13 were on GGA4p and
MGA9 and 26 were on GGA4q and MGA4. These experiments narrowed down the breakpoint in GGA2 to a
region of 1.7 Mb (between BACs bW018L21 and
bW018G01) and the fusion point in GGA4 to a region of
2.46 Mb (between BACs bW044F19 and bW043O01 (Figure 4)). Bioinformatic analysis of these BACs in relation to
the most recent chicken genome assembly (WUSTL 2.1) is
consistent with the presence of the centromere between
them in both cases, i.e. they flank nucleotide positions
52,291,242 & 53,791,241 on GGA2, and 19,307,569 &
20,807,568 on GGA4 respectively.
Turkey chromosome paints on the chicken microarray
Hybridization of DNA derived from flow-sorted turkey
chromosomes MGA3 and 6 (orthologous to GGA2) and
MGA4 and 9 (orthologous to GGA4) to the NimbleGen
chicken whole genome tiling array further confirmed the
centromeric nature of the GGA2: MGA [3+6] breakpoint
and the MGA [4+9]: GGA4 fusion point (Figure 5).
Hybridization of MGA3 and 6 gave positive hybridization
signals on GGA2 between positions 52,287,000 and
53,795,000 (Figure 6a). This is the position of the centromere on GGA2 estimated to be located between positions

nucleotides 52,291,242 and 53,791,241 (WUSTL 2.1).
Hybridization of MGA4 gave positive hybridization signals on GGA4 beyond positions 20,808,000 (Figure 6b).
This is the position of the centromere on GGA4 estimated
to be located between positions nucleotides 19,307,569
and 20,807,568 (WUSTL 2.1). Hybridization using the
MGA 9 paint failed to show any positive signal. Thus the
results of the CGH approach were consistent with those of
reciprocal chromosome painting (on both metaphase and
lampbrush chromosomes, Figures 2 and 3) and those of
the systematic BAC mapping.
Sequence analysis of chicken chromosome arms
Previous sequence analysis of GGA4 [1] suggested that
GGA4p retains the sequence properties (e.g. high gene
density, high recombination frequency) of the microchromosome it once was. An in depth analysis of the sequence

Table 1: Chicken BAC clones and chromosome paints mapped successfully to both chicken (GGA) and turkey (MGA)
microchromosomes. Up to and including GGA28, only GGA22 has neither a BAC nor a paint successfully hybridizing to both species;
for GGA16 only one BAC could be hybridised to both species. The remainder all have at least 2 BACs and/or a paint tagging the
chromosome.

higher gene density is also revealed by a higher CpGisland density and greater gene compactness. In addition
the shorter arm is more GC-rich and has a higher rate of
genetic recombination. In contrast, the characteristics of
GGA2p and GGA2q are very similar.

vidual compared to the 8/chicken sample. Comparison of
the location of turkey/chicken and chicken/chicken CNVs
suggests that 50% of the CNVs are likely to have identical
positions. For the purpose of this study, they were designated as "hotspots" if the same CNV appeared more than
once in different animals (e.g. in broiler, layer and/or turkey – Table 3). The median length of CNVs is also identical at 90 kb.
The location of 21 out of 22 (95.5%) CNVs were associated with genes or "predicted genes." Only in one case (on
chromosome 2, position 25,725,000–25,785,000) did
there appear to be no genes associated with the CNV. This
region however represented a highly conserved non-coding region of unknown function. In 20 out of the 22 CNVs
(90.9%) the regions were conserved in chicken, Xenopus
and zebrafish but, of those 20, only 16 were conserved in
mammals. This suggested either loss or rapid sequence
divergence in mammalian lineages. Many novel genes
appear to be predicted in the non-mammalian lineages
which would support gene loss scenario. Cases of rapid
divergence are supported by associations with the rapidly
evolving proteins of the immune (e.g. MHC and interleukin enhancer binding factor 3) and chemosensory (e.g.
olfactory receptors) systems.

Array CGH experiments
Hybridization of turkey whole genomic DNA on the NimbleGen chicken tiling path microarray revealed evidence
of 16 CNVs (Table 3). The mean and median lengths of
CNVs were 179 kb and 90 kb, respectively and ranged
from 30 kb to 900 kb. From this analysis it is not clear
whether these are insertions or deletions but 15/16
showed a "loss" of signal in the turkey. These may also
represent regions of poor sequence homology and thus
regions that have undergone accelerated sequence divergence. We compared the location of these CNVs with the
location of CNV polymorphisms in the broiler and layer
lines of chickens (Table 3). In all cases the genome of Red
Jungle Fowl sequence [1] was used as a reference DNA.
Comparisons between Red Jungle Fowl and broiler/layer
lines detected 12 CNVs with 8 CNVs/individual distributed on both macro- and micro-chromosomes. The mean
and median lengths of CNVs were 127 kb and 90 kb,
respectively (ranging from 30 to 300 kb). These lengths
are similar to that found for CNVs found in human [24]
but fewer in number with an average of 24/human indi-

Detailed molecular cytogenetic map of the turkey
To the best of our knowledge, the cytogenetic map of the
turkey presented here is the first detailed cytogenetic map
of any avian species produced by comparative chromosome painting and FISH mapping of chicken BACs to
another species. The availability of a comparative map
between turkey and chicken will, first of all, allow the
transfer of genetic information directly from chicken to
turkey, thus expediting mapping studies in turkey. Secondly it will help to target marker development in turkey
through the prediction of new loci. Finally it, and maps of
other species, will provide insight into the conservation
and function of sequences across avian and other vertebrate species. This data will include coding sequences and
also functional non-coding sequences such as telomeres.
The map is sufficiently detailed to allow accurate gene prediction in turkey particularly given that the rearrangements between chicken and turkey are relatively few.
Chromosomal rearrangements between chicken and
turkey
Previous studies based on chromosome banding [16] and
zoo-FISH with chicken macrochromosome paints [15]
suggest that GGA2 represents the ancestral state (reviewed
in [14]) whereas GGA4 represents a derived chromosome
[14]). This model is supported by sequence analysis
which suggests that GGA4p retains the ancestral sequence
characteristics of the smaller chromosome it once was i.e.

high gene density, compact genes, high CpG-island density, high recombination frequency and GC-richness [1]
whereas GGA2 does not.
In the current study further insights are provided than
were previously detectable by banding: On GGA2 and its
orthologues, banding analysis had previously been consistent with a breakpoint above the centromere (since
MGA3 clearly has a small p-arm). The evidence provided
here however suggests that the breakpoint is centromeric
and thus a second mechanism must have been involved in
the origin of MGA3p, probably a pericentric inversion.
The fusion point of GGA4, as well as the two other interchromosomal rearrangements was largely as predicted
from G-banding analysis, i.e. involving the centromeres.
Moreover, although a few of the FLpter measurements
between the two species led to "crossed lines" (e.g.
ABR0047 and GCT0002 in GGA1 and MGA1, MCW0193
and P6C6 in GGA5 and MGA5), all of these were within
an acceptable margin of error and thus no evidence of
paracentric inversions was found. The locations of BACs
on the sequence maps are in most cases derived from the
position of the (microsatellite) marker that was used to
isolate that particular BAC. Therefore some of these inconsistencies may be explained by an incorrect marker-BAC
pair.
For GGA11–21 and GGA23–28 we provide the first evidence suggesting that there are no inter-chromosomal
changes between chicken and turkey among this set of
microchromosomes. This is in line with results from earlier studies that used dual color FISH mapping of a limited
number of BACs to examine synteny of microchromosomes in duck (Anas platyrhynchos) [25] and quail (Coturnix japonica) [26] and found no evidence for interchromosomal rearrangements among microchromosomes. In the present study, only metaphase microchromosomes were examined, which provides limited
resolution due to the small size of the microchromosomes; we therefore cannot preclude the existence of

intra-chromosomal rearrangements until experiments
with very elongated (e.g. lampbrush) chromosomes are
performed. Moreover we cannot exclude the existence of
small local rearrangements that are beyond the resolution
of our mapping methods. For chromosomes 29–38 (the
D-group), chromosome painting experiments were
largely unsuccessful, we believe this was because these
chromosome paints were generated from single templates
and were comparatively weak, even on chicken metaphases [27]. The relatively different sizes of GGA25 and
its turkey orthologue MGA27 provide evidence for our
previous suggestion that this chromosome paint is so
bright compared to others largely because the chromosome consists of repeat elements in chicken [27]. The paucity of markers on the sex chromosomes precluded a full
analysis of the Z (only 4 markers were examined on the Z
chromosome) and any analysis at all on the W chromosome. The position of the centromere on the Z chromosome is different in chicken and turkey, but this most
likely results from the accumulation of heterochromatin
on the chicken Z [15].
Recent evidence [1] suggests that chicken chromosome 22
(GGA22) differs from the other group B-D chromosomes
(chromosomes 11–38) in having a GC content, exon density and repeat density similar to that of the group A chromosomes (1–10 and Z) and may be translocated to
chromosome 3 in turkey. Unfortunately, and frustratingly
although we had several BAC markers from chicken chromosome 22, none worked successfully across species
despite several attempts; we were thus unable to establish
whether a further fission or fusion event occurred between
the ancestral orthologues of GGA3 and GGA22. It is notable however that the use of the chromosome paint for
MGA3 on to chicken chromosomes did not reveal hybridization to a microchromosome in chicken.
The results of the present study therefore confirm that
chicken and turkey karyotypes (common ancestor 25–30
MYA) have undergone very few chromosomal rearrangements during evolution and extends this finding to the

majority of the microchromosomes. By comparison,
humans and new world monkeys (common ancestor
30–35 MYA) have around 10 inter-chromosomal rearrangements; humans and lesser apes (common ancestor
15–20 MYA) have many more [2,3], rats and mice (common ancestor 10–20 MYA) have 14 [2,3]. Although it

might be argued that mice and lesser apes are extreme
examples of where extensive rearrangements have
occurred, the general rate of inter-chromosome rearrangement in mammals is thought to be one every 10 million
years [2,3]. If this model held true for birds then we might
expect about 5 or 6 differences between chicken and turkey since they diverged 25–50 million years ago (around
2 or 3 changes for each lineage). Taking into account how
many more chromosomes birds have than mammals and
the further evidence (from partial karyotypes and zooFISH [14]) of the apparent paucity of arrangements
between macrochromosomes in all birds (even the
ancient ratite birds [14]) it seems reasonable to suggest
that conservation of synteny among the genomes of avian
species appears to be much greater in birds than in mammals.
Approaches for determining the molecular nature of interchromosomal changes
In applying three approaches to determine the molecular
nature of inter-chromosomal changes we have the opportunity to corroborate the accuracy of each independently.
In essence the cross species painting is limited in its resolution, even when applied to lampbrush chromosomes
unless, as in this case here, when we wish to correlate the
breakpoint to an identifiable chromosomal structure such
as a centromere. The systematic BAC mapping is accurate
but laborious and relies on all BACs working cross species
(which they do only approximately 70% of the time
between chicken and turkey). The use of turkey chromosome paints on to the tiling path array however was a single experiment. The potential for applying flow-sorted
chromosome paints to tiling path arrays as a means of
determining ancestral breakpoint and fusion points is
enormous.

The results from the three approaches were not congruent
for MGA9, which gave a signal only when hybridized to
turkey and chicken metaphase chromosomes but not on
chicken lampbrush chromosomes or on the chicken
microarray. However, the chromosome paint for MGA9
gave a comparatively weak signal even on metaphase
chromosomes; the relatively low quality of this paint is
the most likely explanation for the failure of the lampbrush chromosome and microarray experiments.
CNVs as revealed by array CGH
CNVs appear to be found at a lower frequency in chickens
compared to human, almost one-third in number. The
basis of this is unknown but may be related to the threefold more compact chicken genome, with fewer opportunities for CNV generation. The observation that almost
50% of the CNVs in the chicken genome appear to map to
the same regions as CNVs mapped from a comparison of
chicken/turkey genomes suggests a common mechanism

of generation. A similar observation has been made by
comparing CNVs in chimp and human genomes [7]. 58
CNVs were identified from a comparison of chimp and
human [7] compared to only 16 in this study. While it is
possible that, when we look at several Galliform species
and several individuals within each species, more interspecific CNVs may be located it seems unlikely that there
would be an order of magnitude more. Thus while
chicken/turkey diverged from a common ancestor 25–30
MYA and human/chimp only 6 MYA it seems reasonable
to suggest that the low karyotypic variability among birds
(compared to mammals) is mirrored by a low level of
CNVs also. It has been suggested that segmental duplications facilitate chromosome rearrangements and correlate
with CNVs; therefore the lack of segmental duplications in
the avian genome[1] might explain the low number of
chromosomal rearrangements in Galliformes in particular
and birds in general. Comparison of other species would
shed further light on this hypothesis. Besides the generation of CNVs by non-homologous recombination or
other mechanisms, CNVs may have functional consequences and may be of selective advantage. Inspection of
the genomic regions at the CNVs indicates that they are
associated more often than not with genes. From Table 3
it is clear that these CNV regions are also more highly conserved in avian/amphibian/fish species than mammals,
suggesting a link with egg-laying species. The function of
the novel genes found in these regions may shed light on
this idea. An alternative to gene loss may be rapid
sequence divergence in mammalian lineages. Cases of
rapid divergence are supported by associations with the
rapidly evolving proteins of the immune (e.g. MHC and
interleukin enhancer binding factor 3) and olfactory (e.g.
olfactory receptors) systems. This observation suggest a
common link between avian and mammalian CNVs,
where analysis of Gene Ontology [28] terms showed that
genes involved in acquired immunity, innate immunity,
or olfaction were also significantly overrepresented within
human CNVs.
Comparative maps between vertebrate genomes suggest
that rates of chromosomal change can vary widely [29]. In
this study we extend these observations and provide further evidence that avian genomes are more stable both at
the macro-level in terms of chromosomal rearrangements
and the micro-view for CNVs. The fixation of mutations
(including chromosome rearrangements and copy
number variation) is a product of the rate of their generation and the rate they are fixed in a population. The
molecular processes that generate such genomic changes
may vary between birds and mammals. For example,
mammalian genomes have more repetitive elements and
segmental duplications than birds and these sequences
are thought to stimulate chromosome rearrangements
and copy number variation. It must be borne in mind

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/168

however that, once a mutation has arisen, it must be fixed
in the population either by chance or by selective advantage, eventually to contribute to the differences between
species. Differences between mammals and birds at both
the molecular, ecological and behavioral levels are therefore possible reasons to explain the apparent differences
in the stability of their genomes.

Conclusion
This is the first study to combine the modalities of crossspecies chromosome painting, zoo-FISH of known BAC
clones and array CGH to gain insight of comparative
genomics between two avian species. In so doing the first
insight into the conservation of microchromosomes is
provided, as is the first comparative cytogenetic map of an
avian species.

Methods
Cell culture and chromosome preparation
Chicken eggs were supplied by Hill Top Farm, Cambridgeshire, UK and Friday's Farm, Kent, UK. Turkey eggs were
provided by British United Turkeys, Chester, UK. Fibroblast cultures were established from 5- to 7-day-old
embryos. Chromosome preparation using mitostatic
treatment with colcemid, hypotonic treatment with 75
mM KCl and fixation with 3:1 methanol:acetic acid followed standard protocols [30,31]. Chicken lampbrush
chromosomes were prepared as previously described
[32,33].
Generation of chromosome paints
Chromosome paints for chicken macrochromosomes
GGA1–10 and Z and turkey macrochromosomes
MGA1–9 and Z were isolated by fluorescence-activated
chromosome sorting at the Cambridge Resource Centre
for Comparative Genomics (Cambridge Veterinary
School, University of Cambridge, UK) as previously
described [27,31]. Chromosome paints for chicken
microchromosomes GGA11–28 were isolated by needle
microdissection [27,34]. Macro- and microchromosome
paints were amplified by DOP-PCR [35] and labeled by a
secondary round of DOP-PCR incorporating biotin-16dUTP or digoxigenin-11-dUTP (Roche). As described in
[26] and [30], microchromosomal paints were generated
from amplifications of single chromosomes at random,
then distinguished from one another by dual color FISH.
Isolation, amplification and labeling of chicken BACs
BAC clones were selected from the Wageningen chicken
BAC library [36] based on the position of markers on the
chicken consensus linkage map [37] and were chosen at
regular intervals across the different linkage groups/chromosomes except in regions of putative evolutionary rearrangements for which a more concentrated suite of BAC
clones was selected. All BACs are anchored to the chicken

genome assembly by linkage and end-sequencing. BACs
were extracted using the Tepnel Nucleoplex BAC Automated DNA Purification System (Tepnel Life Sciences)
and labeled by nick translation with biotin-16-dUTP or
digoxigenin-11-dUTP (Roche) following standard protocols.
Fluorescent in situ hybridization
Slides with metaphase preparations were aged for 1 hour
at 70°C on a hotplate. BACs and/or chromosome paints
were applied to the metaphase preparations and sealed
under a cover slip before simultaneous denaturation of
probe and target DNA for 5 minutes on a 68°C hotplate.
Hybridization was carried out in a humidified chamber
for 24–72 hours at 37°C. Following post-hybridization
washes (2 minutes in 0.4 × SSC/0.3% Igepal at 73°C; 1
minute in 2 × SSC/0.1% Igepal at RT; 15 minutes in 4 ×
SSC/0.05% Tween 20 at RT; 25 minutes in 4 × SSC/0.05%
Tween 20/2% BSA at RT), biotin- and digoxigenin-labeled
probes were detected with streptavidin-Cy3 (Amersham)
and fluorescein anti-digoxigenin (Roche), respectively,
and counterstained using Vectashield with DAPI (Vector
Labs). Confirmation of BAC order was achieved by dual
color experiments where biotin- and digoxigenin-labeled
probes were hybridized simultaneously.
Image capturing and analysis
Images were captured using a Leica epifluorescence microscope equipped with cooled CCD camera (Photometrics)
and Smart Capture software (Digital Scientific). Signal
position on chromosomes was established by measuring
the fractional length from the p-terminus (FLpter) [38].
The signal positions were measured as Analysis was performed using GIMP, the freeware GNU Image Manipulation Program following the protocol described by [38].
The total length of the chromosome with the BAC signal
and the length from the signal to the p terminus were
measured using the measure tool and were expressed as a
ratio, with the p terminus being 0.0 and the q terminus
being 1.0. At least 10 metaphases were analyzed for each
BAC.
Analysis of sequence composition of chromosome arms
All data used the WUSTL 2.1 (May 2006) build of the
chicken genome. Gene position and gene structure are
derived from the ENSEMBL 43 gene build and downloaded through BioMart. The CpG and repeats information have been retrieved from the UCSC Genome Browser
http://genome.ucsc.edu/ for the corresponding gene
build. CpG islands have been identified using an algorithm written by Andy Law with minor modifications by
Angie Hinrichs [1]. The repeats data have been identified
with Arian Smit's RepeatMasker program [39], which
screens DNA sequences for interspersed repeats and low
complexity DNA sequences. RepeatMasker uses the Rep-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/168

Base library of repeats from the Genetic Information
Research Institute [40]. Only the repeated regions have
been considered, by filtering out the low complexity one.
The corresponding number of nucleotides involved in
such structures has been divided by the length of each
arm. The genomic GC% has been calculated with 50 kb
windows. The GC% for introns and exons has been calculated for each intron and exon. For the graphical representation, a window of 1 Mb size has been used for each
represented parameter. For the gene density, it corresponds to the cumulative plot of uniform distribution
subtracted to the real gene distribution across the chromosome. Same has been used for the representation of the
compactness (exons length/(introns + exons length)) and
CpG islands (cumulative number of CpG). On each
graph, the centromeric region has been identified.
Comparative Genome Hybridization (CGH) experiments
The NimbleGen chicken whole-genome tiling array (Catalogue Number/Design Name B3791001-00-01, galGal3
WG CGH – Roche NimbleGen, Milton Keynes, UK) was
used for all microarray experiments. It contains 385,000
50-mer oligonucleotides with an average spacing of 2,586
base pairs (source – UCSC, build – galGal3) and was
interrogated with chromosome paints for turkey chromosomes 3, 4, 6 and 9 and, for the array CGH experiments,
with chicken and turkey whole genomic DNA. Turkey
chromosome paints were generated as described above
but not labeled, and whole genomic DNA was extracted in
house; the reference (Red Jungle Fowl) DNA for the array
CGH experiments was a gift from Dr Hans Cheng (Michigan State University). Labeling of chromosome paints and
genomic DNA and hybridization to the NimbleGen array
were performed by the company (NimbleGen) and used
a random prime labeling kit to incorporate modified
nucleotides by either amino-allyl or direct linkage to
either of the two dyes used (Cy3 and Cy5). All of the
hybridizations in this experiment used two dyes per slide
(Cy3 and Cy5). For the array chromosome painting experiments, MGA3 (Cy3) was co-hybridized with MGA6
(Cy5) and MGA9 (Cy3) co-hybridized with MGA4 (Cy5).
For the array CGH Red Jungle Fowl DNA (reference, Cy5)
was co-hybridized with either chicken or turkey test DNA
(Cy3).

CGH analysis proceeded in three stages, normalization,
window averaging and segmentation. After combining the
signal intensity and genomic coordinate information, the
Cy3 and Cy5 signal intensities were normalized to one
another using Qspline normalization [41]. Qspline is a
robust non-linear method for normalization using array
signal distribution analysis and cubic splines. Once normalized, the data was prepared for DNA segmentation
analysis. This included a window averaging step, where
the probes that fall into a defined base pair window size

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:168

are averaged, using the Tukey's biweight mean [42]. The
Tukey's biweight method yields a robust weighted mean
that is relatively insensitive to outliers, even when
extreme. A new position was assigned to this average,
which is the midpoint of the window. Window sizes of
30, 60 and 150 kb were used. The circular binary segmentation algorithm [43] was used to segment the averaged log2
ratio data. DNA segments were called by attempting to
break the segments into sub-segments by looking at the tstatistic of the means. Permutations (n = 1000) were used
to provide the reference distribution. If the resulting pvalue was below the threshold (default of p = 0.01), then
a breakpoint was called. A pruning step was used to
remove spurious segments, rejecting segments where the
standard deviation of the means was not sufficiently different. By default, a cut off of 1.5 standard deviations was
used. There are three kinds of output produced by the
DNA segmentation analysis: a segmentation table, a PDF
plot, and a GFF file. The PDF plot and GFF file show the
log2 ratios as black dots and the predicted segments as red
lines. The segmentation table shows the endpoints and
mean log2 value of each predicted segment. This is the
data used to draw the lines on the individual plots using
the SignalMap™ viewer (NimbleGen, version 1.8). Information regarding GFF file formats can be found on the
Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute web site [44].
