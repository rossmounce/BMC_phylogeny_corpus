Abstract
Background: In mouse the cytokine interleukin-7 (IL-7) is required for generation of B
lymphocytes, but human IL-7 does not appear to have this function. A bioinformatics approach was
therefore used to identify IL-7 receptor related genes in the hope of identifying the elusive human
cytokine.
Results: Our database search identified a family of nine gene candidates, which we have
provisionally named fibronectin immunoglobulin leucine-rich repeat (FIGLER). The FIGLER 1–9 genes are
predicted to encode type I transmembrane glycoproteins with 6–12 leucine-rich repeats (LRR), a
C2 type Ig domain, a fibronectin type III domain, a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and a
cytoplasmic domain containing one to four tyrosine residues. Members of this multichromosomal
gene family possess 20–47% overall amino acid identity and are differentially expressed in cell lines
and primary hematopoietic lineage cells. Genes for FIGLER homologs were identified in macaque,
orangutan, chimpanzee, mouse, rat, dog, chicken, toad, and puffer fish databases. The non-human
FIGLER homologs share 38–99% overall amino acid identity with their human counterpart.
Conclusion: The extracellular domain structure and absence of recognizable cytoplasmic signaling
motifs in members of the highly conserved FIGLER gene family suggest a trophic or cell adhesion
function for these molecules.

Background
Interleukin-7 (IL-7) is a non-redundant cytokine required
for the generation of B and T lineage cells in mice [1-5].
Although IL-7 is essential for T cell development in
humans, human B cell development is unaffected by the

absence of IL-7 or its receptors [6-8]. Despite extensive
research, the predicted IL-7 equivalent for human B lymphopoiesis has so far eluded identification. An important
clue, provided by recent studies showing that human
hematopoietic progenitors develop into mature B cells

after transplantation in immunodeficient mice, suggests
that the molecules essential for human B cell development are either present in the mouse or can be provided
by the transplanted human cells [9,10]. In seeking a
human B lymphopoietic cytokine/receptor pair, we reasoned that novel or orphan human receptors with structural features resembling those of the IL-7 receptor would
be good candidates. A common feature of many cytokine
receptors is the presence of Ig domains, fibronectin (FN)
type III domains, and potential signaling capability [11].
Ig domains define members of the Ig superfamily, which
is the largest family of mammalian cell surface molecules,
comprising approximately half of the leukocyte cell surface glycoproteins [12]. FNIII domains are often found in
molecules with adhesive function and can act as a spacer
to ensure the correct positioning of functional sites [13].
Using bioinformatic searches for transmembrane proteins
with Ig domains, FNIII domains, and signaling potential,
nine human genes were identified that fulfilled the search
criteria. These encode type I transmembrane glycoproteins, with 6–12 leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), one C2 Ig
domain, one FNIII domain, a transmembrane domain,
and a tyrosine containing cytoplasmic domain. The genes
have been provisionally named fibronectin immunoglobulin
leucine-rich repeat (FIGLER) 1–9. In contrast to the known

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/36

cytokine receptors, the predicted FIGLER molecules have
a unique domain structure, marked by the N-terminal
LRRs and an unusual genomic organization. Two previously described molecules that combine LRR, Ig and FNIII
domains with unknown signaling capacities and function
are included in this family, namely the photoreceptorassociated LRR superfamily member (PAL) and the neuronal leucine-rich repeat protein 3 (NLRR3) [14-22]. Here,
we describe the features and expression patterns of the
human FIGLER family members and identify multiple
non-human orthologs.

Results
Identification of human FIGLER genes
Over 3000 nucleotide and amino acid sequences of hypothetical proteins, as defined by the NCBI database, were
analyzed by SMART and BLAST to determine domain
structure and sequence similarity to known molecules.
The initial screening of the human NCBI Genome Database led to the identification of a hypothetical gene that
was predicted to encode a protein with IL-7 receptor-like
structure in that it possessed both Ig and FNIII domains.
The predicted amino acid sequence was then used to
search NCBI's BLAST protein database, leading to the
identification of eight other related molecules in humans
(Figure 1 and Table 1). Based on analysis using the SMART

(FIGLER) 1–9. Although the FIGLER genes are dispersed
in the genome, the predicted amino acid sequences of the
nine FIGLER molecules share 20–47% overall amino acid
identity. Tyrosines are present in each of the FIGLER cytoplasmic regions, although they are not located within currently recognizable signaling motifs. Further analysis of
the predicted amino acid sequences indicated that FIGLER
5 and FIGLER 9 correspond to the previously described
NLRR3 and Pal genes [16,21,22].
Cellular expression of human FIGLER
As this study was directed initially toward identification of
genes that might influence human B lymphopoiesis, RT-

PCR analysis of FIGLER gene expression was performed
on fetal bone marrow B lymphocyte subpopulations,
bone marrow stromal cell lines, fetal thymus, and the
non-B cell fraction in bone marrow. PCR products were
cloned and sequenced to confirm their identity (data not
shown). FIGLER 9 (Pal) served as a negative control gene
in these experiments, as it was previously shown to be retina-specific (Figure 2A) [16]. The analysis indicated that
FIGLER 1,2,3, and 5 mRNA transcripts were expressed in
primary B lineage cells. FIGLER 1 expression began at the
immature sIgM+ B cell stage. FIGLER 2 expression was
detected at low levels in pro-B cells and in the
CD34+CD19- cells, a heterogeneous population that
includes hematopoietic stem cells. FIGLER 3 expression
was initiated at the pro-B cell stage, and FIGLER 5 expression began at the pre-B cell stage. FIGLER 1 and 5 were
also expressed by non-B lineage BM cells. Only FIGLER 2
was found to be expressed in human stromal cell lines.

Methods section.

FIGLER 4,6,7 and 8 could not be detected in any of the
bone marrow-derived cells examined, despite multiple
attempts and the use of three or more different gene-specific primer pairs per gene. To examine the FIGLER gene
expression pattern further, we analyzed representative
hemopoietic cell lines, B, T, myeloid and erythroid (Figure
2B). The up-regulation of FIGLER 1 expression observed
as a function of normal B cell development was also
observed in representative B lineage cell lines, although
the OB5 pre-B cell line had relatively high levels compared to the normal pre-B cells. FIGLER 1 and 2 were
expressed weakly in the thymus and in the Jurkat T cell
line, whereas they exhibited reciprocal expression patterns
in myeloid cell lines. The K562 erythroid cell line did not
express any of the FIGLER genes. Surprisingly, given their
robust expression in primary cells of bone marrow origin,
FIGLER 3 and 5 were not detected in any of the cell lines
tested, nor were FIGLER 6, 7, and 8 (data not shown). As
the NCBI EST profile database did not contain bone marrow or spleen expression data for the FIGLER molecules,
this constitutes the first evidence for expression of these
molecules in the bone marrow and B lineage cells in particular.
Identification of non-human FIGLER homologs
Putative FIGLER orthologs were found in macaque, chimpanzee, orangutan, mouse, rat, dog, chicken, toad, and
puffer fish NCBI databases using the BLASTN algorithmic
search for homology to the identified human FIGLER
gene sequences (Tables 2, 3, 4, 5). Hidden Markov model
searching of GenBank led to the identification of five
potential new FIGLER orthologs in Takifugu rubripes,
although little information is available about these molecules except amino acid sequence (data not shown).

As was the case for their human counterparts, these genes
were found to be located on different chromosomes. All
FIGLER orthologs contained 6–12 LRR, a single C2 type Ig
domain, a FN type III domain, a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and from one to seven cytoplasmic tyrosines. The predicted amino acid sequences of the FIGLER

homologs shared 38–99% overall identity with their
human counterpart. Phylogenetic tree analysis was performed to cluster the non-human FIGLER molecules to
their nearest human FIGLER homolog (Figure 3). The
alternative names, chromosomal locations, predicted
amino acid length, and accession numbers of the human
FIGLER and non-human FIGLER molecules are listed in
Tables 6 and 7.
The chromosomal regions of the human and mouse
FIGLER genes were compared to further examine their
relatedness. The positions of neighboring upstream and
downstream genes were found to be highly conserved, but
the regions containing the mouse FIGLER genes were
inverted relative to the orientation of human FIGLER
chromosomal regions. This is illustrated for FIGLER 1 and
mouse FIGLER 1 (Figure 4). By contrast, the non-mouse
FIGLER genes have the same chromosomal orientation as
their human FIGLER counterparts (data not shown).
As the known NLRR3 (FIGLER 5) and Pal (FIGLER 9)
genes have been shown to have an unusual three exon
structure, we analyzed the predicted exon structure of the
entire FIGLER gene family (Figure 5). Most of the human
FIGLER and non-human FIGLER genes have the same
atypical 3 exon structure, in which exon 1 contains the 5'
untranslated region; exon 2 encodes the signal peptide,
LRR, Ig domain, and part of the FNIII domain; and exon
3 encodes the remaining FNIII region, transmembrane
region, cytoplasmic tail, and 3' untranslated region.
Human FIGLER 3, 5, and 7, chimpanzee FIGLER 5, mouse
FIGLER 5 and 7, rat FIGLER 8, and dog FIGLER 5 are
encoded by a single exon. Interestingly, chimpanzee and
chicken FIGLER 9 and chicken FIGLER 4 have a more
standard exon organization, in which exon 1 contains the
5'untranslated region, exon 2 encodes the LRRs, exon 3
contains the Ig domain, and exon 4 encodes the FNIII
region, transmembrane domain, cytoplasmic tail and
3'UTR.

novel IL-7-like receptor, the FIGLER molecules differ from
known cytokine receptors in that they have LRR domains
on the N-terminal end of the protein. The LRRs are characterized by specific leucine and asparagine residue spacing and are found in proteins with diverse functions and
cellular distribution [14,15,17,21,22]. LRRs also are

gene family. All of the members encode type I transmembrane proteins, and each gene is located on a different
chromosome, except for the chimpanzee FIGLER 1 and 8,
which are both located on chromosome 19. Based on
human FIGLER and mouse FIGLER gene chromosomal
analysis, it is likely that the human and non-human
FIGLER genes are homologs that were derived from common ancestral genes. Intriguingly, the mouse FIGLER
genes are located on inverted chromosomal segments relative to their human syntenic regions, although FIGLER
genes in other species have the same orientation as their
human counterparts.

Figure 5
Predicted genomic structure and protein product of human and non-human FIGLER molecules
Predicted genomic structure and protein product of human and non-human FIGLER molecules. S, Signal Peptide;
LNT, N-terminal leucine-rich repeat; L, leucine-rich repeat domain; LCT, C-terminal leucine-rich repeat, Ig, C2 type Ig domain;
FNIII, FN type III domain; TM, hydrophobic transmembrane domain; Y, tyrosine in predicted cytoplasmic domain. Non-human
FIGLER genes not listed in this schematic have the same three exon structure as human FIGLER 1, 2, 4, 8, and 9.

As the known NLRR3 (FIGLER 5) and Pal (FIGLER 9)
genes have been shown to have an unusual predicted exon
structure, we determined the exon structure of the entire
FIGLER gene family [16,21,22]. Most of the human
FIGLER and non-human FIGLER genes have the same
atypical 3 exon structure, in which exon 1 contains the 5'
untranslated region; exon 2 encodes the signal peptide,
LRR, Ig domain, and part of the FNIII domain; and exon
3 encodes the remaining FNIII region, transmembrane
region, cytoplasmic tail, and 3' untranslated region. Ig
domains are almost universally encoded by a single exon,
which in part is thought to have accounted for their ready
dispersal in the genome and widespread utilization in cell
surface glycoproteins with multiple functions. Human
FIGLER 3, 5, and 7, chimpanzee FIGLER 5, mouse FIGLER
5, mouse FIGLER 7, rat FIGLER 8, and dog FIGLER 5 are
all intronless genes, suggesting their integration into the
genome via reverse transcription. Nevertheless we have
demonstrated cellular expression for all but FIGLER 4 and
6–8, and all of these genes are predicted to encode an
intact open reading frame. Finally, the chimpanzee and
chicken FIGLER 9 genes and chicken FIGLER 4 have a
more typical organization, and the Ig domain is encoded
by a separate exon.

Conclusion
The functions of the FIGLER gene products are presently
unknown. FIGLER 5 and 9 are identical to the previously
identified Pal and NLRR3. Pal is a type 1 transmembrane
protein that is preferentially expressed in the retina, where
it is up-regulated during photoreceptor outer segment
development. As for the other FIGLER family members,
Pal lacks recognizable signaling motifs in its cytoplasmic
tail and is predicted to act as a trophic factor receptor or
adhesion molecule [16]. NLRRs were identified through
screening of a mouse brain cDNA library, and homologs
have been found in Xenopus, rat, and human brain tissue
[18-20,24,25]. All of the NLRR members are expressed
predominately in the central nervous system [24]. Of the
three known mouse NLRRs, only NLRR3 is up-regulated
with brain injury, thereby suggesting its involvement in
injury recognition or repair [26]. While several of the
FIGLER molecules described here are expressed in B lineage cells and the expression of FIGLER 1, 3, and 5 is developmentally regulated within this lineage, the possibility
that these molecules are involved in the interaction
between B lineage cells with the supportive bone marrow
microenvironment remains speculative.

Methods
Database and search strategies
The nucleotide sequence, amino acid sequence and
domain structure of the human IL-7 receptor α chain
(NM_002185) was used in the basic local alignment
search tool (BLAST) and simple modular architecture
research tool (SMART) database searches for novel IL-7
receptor α chain relatives [27-29]. The National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI), European Molecular
Biology Laboratory (EMBL), Ensembl, and DNA database
in Japan were all queried, including the expressed
sequence tags (EST) and high throughput genomic
sequences (HTGS) databases. The predicted human
FIGLER sequences were used to identify homologs in
other species using BLASTN algorithmic and hidden
Markov model (HMM) searches of the NCBI and GenBank databases. HMM hits were filtered through Pfam
according to their domain composition. The NCBI
genome database was used to align the predicted mRNA
sequences to the genomic sequences and determine
intron-exon boundaries. The human BLAST-like alignment tool (BLAT) database (University of California at
Santa Cruz) and Megalign CLUSTALW method algorithm
(Windows version 3.12e; DNASTAR, Madison, WI, USA)
were used to design primers and determine amino acid
identity among the newly identified FIGLER molecules.
The molecular coding amino acid sequence region phylogenetic tree analysis of the FIGLER molecules as listed in
the GenBank database was conducted using the CLUSTALW method algorithm of Megalign [30]. The variable
length LRR regions were masked out during phylogenetic
analysis in order to compensate for sequence length.
Cell lines
Human stromal cell lines included the WW, WWX, and
stromal 8 lines, which were derived from bone marrow
samples in our laboratory. B lineage cell lines were REH
and Nalm 16 (pro B cell); 697, 207, and OB5 (pre B cell);
and Ramos, Daudi, and Raji (B cell). Myeloid cell lines
included THP-1 (monocytic), HL-60 (promyelocytic),
U937, and KG-1 (myelocytic). The Jurkat T cell line and
K562 erythroid cell lines were also used in this analysis.
Human bone marrow and thymus primary cell isolation
Human adult bone marrow was obtained from resected
ribs of healthy renal transplant donors in accordance with
policies established by the University of Alabama at Birmingham Institutional Review Board. The resected ribs
were processed within 24 h of obtainment, and lymphoid
cells were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation (Mediatech, Herndon, VA, USA). B lineage cells were
isolated from the bone marrow samples using a MACS B
cell Isolation Kit (Miltenyl Biotec, Auburn, CA, USA). The
isolated primary B lineage cells were resuspended in FACS
buffer (FACS buffer: PBS plus 2% FBS) and incubated for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/36

20 min at 4°C with CD34-APC, CD19-PE, and IgM-FITC
labeled antibodies (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA, USA).
The cells were then sorted based on their differential
CD34, CD19, and IgM expression into four B lineage populations: CD34+19-, CD34+19+, CD34-19+IgM-, and
CD34-19+IgM+, using a MoFlo instrument (Cytomation,
Fort Collins, CO, USA). Human fetal bone marrow and
thymus samples used for RT-PCR analysis were obtained
in accordance with policies established by the University
of Alabama at Birmingham Institutional Review Board.
Lymphocytes from 12-to 29-week fetal bone marrow and
thymus were obtained by sedimentation at 100 g over a
lymphocyte separation medium for 30 min at room temperature. The cells recovered at the interface were washed
in PBS containing 5% FCS and 2 to 4 × 107 cells. B lineage
cells were isolated from the bone marrow and thymus
samples using a MACS B cell Isolation Kit.
Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR
Total RNA was isolated from isolated populations of primary fetal bone marrow B lineage cells, primary fetal
thymic T lineage cells, hematopoietic cell lines, and stromal cell lines using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA). cDNA was generated from the isolated mRNA using
Superscript First Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR, per
the manufacturer's suggestions (Invitrogen). The following gene specific primers were used to amplify each gene
via PCR using Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen): FIGLER 1, forward 5'-CTGCTAGGCAACTCAAGC-3'
and reverse 5'-GATAGGCCGCTGATCCG-3'; FIGLER 2,
forward 5'-GCTACTTCTGGCATGTGC-3' and reverse 5'ACCACTGTCCTGAGATGT-3'; FIGLER 3, forward 5'-CAGTACAGCCCTTGCTG-3' and reverse 5'-CCACATGTAATAGCTTG-3';
FIGLER
4,
forward
5'CTCGTGGTGACCAGTACT-3' and reverse 5'-AGCTTCTGTCACGTCTGC-3'; FIGLER 5, forward 5'-CAGCAATGCTCTCAGTGC-3'
and
reverse
5'TCGAGCACTTTGCGCAG-3'; FIGLER 9, forward 5'-TCTCAATGCAGCTGCAGC-3' and reverse 5'-GCTGGCACATCTCAGTTC-3'.
Each
amplification
reaction
underwent an initial denaturation of 94°C for 2.5 min,
followed by 35 cycles of annealing at 55°C for 1 min,
extension at 72°C for 1 min, denaturation at 94°C for 1
min, and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. The PCR
products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis,
and their identity was verified via sequencing after cloning
into a TOPO TA pCR2.1 Vector (Invitrogen). DNA
sequencing was accomplished for both strands by the
dideoxy chain termination method using Thermo Sequenase (Amersham Biosciences Corp, Piscataway, NJ, USA),
per the manufacturer's suggestions, and an automated
sequencer (LiCor, Lincoln, NE, USA).
