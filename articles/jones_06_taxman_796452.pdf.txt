Abstract
Background: Phylogenetic analysis of large, multiple-gene datasets, assembled from public
sequence databases, is rapidly becoming a popular way to approach difficult phylogenetic problems.
Supermatrices (concatenated multiple sequence alignments of multiple genes) can yield more
phylogenetic signal than individual genes. However, manually assembling such datasets for a large
taxonomic group is time-consuming and error-prone. Additionally, sequence curation, alignment
and assessment of the results of phylogenetic analysis are made particularly difficult by the potential
for a given gene in a given species to be unrepresented, or to be represented by multiple or partial
sequences. We have developed a software package, TaxMan, that largely automates the processes
of sequence acquisition, consensus building, alignment and taxon selection to facilitate this type of
phylogenetic study.
Results: TaxMan uses freely available tools to allow rapid assembly, storage and analysis of large,
aligned DNA and protein sequence datasets for user-defined sets of species and genes. The user
provides GenBank format files and a list of gene names and synonyms for the loci to analyse.
Sequences are extracted from the GenBank files on the basis of annotation and sequence similarity.
Consensus sequences are built automatically. Alignment is carried out (where possible, at the
protein level) and aligned sequences are stored in a database. TaxMan can automatically determine
the best subset of taxa to examine phylogeny at a given taxonomic level. By using the stored aligned
sequences, large concatenated multiple sequence alignments can be generated rapidly for a subset
and output in analysis-ready file formats. Trees resulting from phylogenetic analysis can be stored
and compared with a reference taxonomy.
Conclusion: TaxMan allows rapid automated assembly of a multigene datasets of aligned
sequences for large taxonomic groups. By extracting sequences on the basis of both annotation and
BLAST similarity, it ensures that all available sequence data can be brought to bear on a
phylogenetic problem, but remains fast enough to cope with many thousands of records. By
automatically assisting in the selection of the best subset of taxa to address a particular phylogenetic
problem, TaxMan greatly speeds up the process of generating multiple sequence alignments for
phylogenetic analysis. Our results indicate that an automated phylogenetic workbench can be a
useful tool when correctly guided by user knowledge.

Background
Recently, there has been much interest in the use of large,
concatenated multiple sequence alignments ('supermatrices') for phylogenetic analysis [1,2]. Such datasets have
been shown to be useful in resolving difficult phylogenetic questions with a high degree of confidence. By combining the phylogenetic signal from multiple genes,
clades can be recovered that are not recovered under analysis of any of the individual genes. Additionally, genes
evolving at different rates may offer resolution at different
phylogenetic levels.
Large-scale phylogenetic analyses of the type described
above place a heavy burden of sequence acquisition, dataset assembly and dataset storage on the researcher.
Sequences corresponding to the genes of interest must be
obtained from public databases and orthology assigned.
Where multiple sequences are available for a given gene in
a species (as is often the case with EST datasets, for example) a consensus sequence must be derived. The sequences
for each gene must then be aligned before being added to
a concatenated alignment file, which may also contain
commands necessary to partition the data. The forest of
trees resulting from subsequent phylogenetic analysis
must be associated with the relevant datasets, analysis
parameters and confidence metrics. With these tasks in
mind we have developed an integrated solution, TaxMan.
TaxMan reduces this curatorial burden by automatically
assembling and storing large aligned sequence datasets,
and also storing metadata and trees resulting from phylogenetic analysis. Because of the high level of automation
offered by TaxMan, datasets can be rebuilt rapidly to
include new sequence data.

Implementation
TaxMan is written in Perl [see Additional file 1] and makes
extensive use of modules from the BioPerl project [3].
PostgreSQL, a relational database management system
(RDBMS), is used to store data. TaxMan makes use of
many freely available bioinformatics tools; see the user
guide [see Additional file 2] for a complete list and details
of how to obtain them. The steps required to build a database of aligned genes are threefold; sequence acquisition,
consensus derivation and alignment. Figure 1 gives an
overview of the TaxMan workflow.
Database construction
TaxMan extracts DNA sequence data from GenBank format [4] files on the basis of either annotation or sequence
similarity to a database of identified genes. The NCBI Entrez service [5] allows a user to quickly select sequences
from a given taxonomic group for download, and to filter
out large records (e.g. chromosomes) that may cause
problems. Curated genome-scale datasets of coding
sequences can be included by downloading them from

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/536

the relevant genome database. The user must supply a predefined list the genes for which they wish to extract
records, and, for each, a list of synonyms – for example,
cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 is variously annotated as
'COX1', 'CO1', 'COI', etc. When extracting sequence data
based on annotation, TaxMan reads each GenBank record
from a file and examines all features tagged as 'CDS' or
'rRNA'. Features with annotation matching that of one of
the genes of interest are stored. To extract records on the
basis of similarity, the user must supply a datasets of
sequences known to be members of the target gene set.
This dataset can be generated automatically from a GenBank format file. TaxMan uses BLAST [6] to identify
sequences with significant similarity to known representatives of the gene set. Sequences extracted on the basis of
annotation are referred to as 'annotated sequences'; those
extracted on the basis of sequence similarity are referred to
as 'screened sequences'. Screened sequences are normally
ESTs, but may also be full length CDSs that were not
annotated, or genomic fragments. By extracting and storing only sequence data that are of interest, TaxMan can
cope with extremely large input datasets (e.g. all 1.5 million GenBank CoreNucleotide records for the phylum
Arthropoda).
TaxMan assumes that all sequences with a given userassigned gene name are orthologues, and a single definitive sequence is derived for each gene in each species.
Users must take care to specify synonyms for genes in
which they can be confident of orthology. A simple rulebased approach is used, whereby sequences from fully
sequenced genomes are preferred over "annotated"
sequences, which are preferred over "screened" sequences.
Where multiple sequences of the same type are available,
phrap [7] is used to generate a consensus sequence which
is stored in the database. Annotation in GenBank may
contain errors, and these measures are designed to minimise their effect.
For each species, metadata derived from the GenBank
accession, including the unique 'taxid' identifying the species of origin, are also stored. All a priori taxonomic information stored in TaxMan is extracted from the NCBI
taxonomic database [8]. Although the NCBI taxonomy is
not an authoritative source, it is the framework within
which sequences are stored, and is the only complete
source of information regarding the relationships
between the taxa that are represented in GenBank. Support for alternative taxonomies is a possible future feature
of TaxMan (see limitations and extensions below).
For each gene, consensus sequences from all taxa are
aligned using POA [9]. POA performs global multiple
sequence alignment which, in preliminary testing, was
found to cope well with partial sequences that are often

found in datasets assembled by TaxMan. Other alignment
programs can be used with relatively straightforward
changes to the program code. The alignment process is
different for protein-coding and rRNA genes. For proteincoding genes, all "annotated" sequences are translated to
protein based on the GenBank-annotated start and stop
codons and the protein sequences aligned. The DNA
sequences are then back-aligned on the protein alignment
using the transeq program from the EMBOSS package
[10]. Finally, the "screened" sequences are added to the
DNA alignment. The individual aligned protein
sequences and aligned DNA sequences are stored in the
database. For RNA genes, all sequences are aligned simultaneously and the aligned sequences stored as DNA.
Importantly, TaxMan does not carry out any type of alignment quality control; alignments should be checked
either manually or using an objective score function such
as norMD [11]. Manual inspection of alignments will also
uncover any erroneous sequences introduced by incorrect
GenBank annotations.
Output of datasets for phylogenetic analysis
Once a set of aligned sequences has been generated and
stored, TaxMan can produce concatenated multiple
sequence alignment files containing subsets of genes and
taxa (called 'slices') in a partitioned format suitable for
phylogenetic analysis. Slices can be specified manually by
the user, or TaxMan can select slices automatically by
including a chosen number of representatives from each
group at a given taxonomic level, determined using the
NCBI taxonomy. Specifying a slice in this way allows an
alignment to be produced that has wide taxonomic sampling while keeping the total number of taxa computationally tractable. TaxMan produces alignments in Nexus,
Phylip and FASTA file formats, suitable for analysis with a
range of phylogenetic software packages. Alignments output from TaxMan in Nexus format contain character set
commands partitioning the alignment by gene and by
codon position.
Storing the results of phylogenetic analysis
TaxMan can also store trees resulting from phylogenetic
analysis. The structure of a tree is stored in the form of
individual nodes, which allows storage of branch lengths
and support values, along with links to species data for the
terminal nodes. By storing multiple data types together in
a database, GenBank records, consensus sequences,
aligned sequences, alignments and trees can be collected
in one place and much record-keeping taken care of automatically.

Results
TaxMan was used to assemble a dataset for seventeen loci,
including mitochondrial protein-coding (all 13 animal
mitochondrial protein-coding genes) and ribosomal RNA

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/536

genes (12S and 16S), and nuclear ribosomal RNA genes
(SSU, LSU), from the subphylum Chelicerata. Approximately 12,000 annotated CoreNucleotide records and
74,000 EST records were downloaded from the NCBI
GenBank database using Entrez [5](15/10/2005). TaxMan extracted 5,410 annotated sequences and 8,807
screened sequences using a chelicerate mitochondrial
genome BLAST database. 1,204 species were included,
representing 3 classes, 17 orders and 142 families. 2,398
consensus sequences were generated (1,992 from annotated sequences, 136 from EST sequences, 270 from fully
sequenced mitochondrial genomes) and aligned. At this
point, subsets of genes and taxa were specified and concatenated alignment files generated for phylogenetic analysis. For example, a slice was automatically specified that
contained all genes and 3 representative species per order,
selecting taxa with the most sequence available. The alignment file resulting from this slice was analysed to investigate the relationships between the chelicerate orders [12].
The process took approximately two hours (not including
phylogenetic analysis) on a Linux server (Intel Xeon 3.4
GHz processor and 2 GB of RAM).

Discussion
We envisage the target users of TaxMan as researchers with
experience of phylogenetics who are interested in assembling and curating a large set of aligned sequences and
resulting trees for a taxonomic group for multiple-gene
phylogeny. Using TaxMan, the user can assemble a large
dataset of aligned DNA and protein sequences for multiple genes much more quickly and more completely than
could be achieved manually. It can cope with very large
input datasets and also facilitates selection of taxa for
analysis and curation of phylogenetic results. Other phylogenetics software packages do not fulfil the role of TaxMan. Some packages carry out a single step in the
phylogenetic process (for example, HAL [13] attempts to
define orthologues in a sequence dataset using sequence
similarity, and the Phylota [14] project contains applications for database clustering and subset definition) but
lack integration. ARB [15] is a computing environment for
phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences, originally developed for RNA genes, but it cannot cope with multiple
genes or construct consensus sequences. TreeBlaster [16]
gathers sequence data based on BLAST similarity and uses
phylogenetic software tools to construct a tree, but cannot
use multiple genes, select sets of sequences for analysis,
build consensus sequences or store phylogenetic results.
The Arthropodan Mitochondrial Genomes Accessible
database (AmiGA [17]) produces concatenated alignments for multiple genes, but requires that slices are specified prior to alignment, resulting in much greater
processing times.

TaxMan is limited by design in two main ways; firstly, it is
incapable of storing multiple reference taxonomies,
instead taking the NCBI taxonomy as a base. Secondly, it
assumes that a single consensus sequence is to be generated for each locus in each species, making it unsuitable
for sampling from gene families, or from populations
from within species (as found, for example, in DNA barcoding studies). Planned future directions for TaxMan
include support for multiple taxonomies and for multiple
sequences per locus. A mechanism allowing users to easily
exclude sequences that have been incorrectly identified
would be of benefit – currently, sequences must be
deleted manually from the database. Routines for automatic orthology assignment, a significant problem in its
own right, could also be included. The ability of TaxMan
to store multiple phylogenetic trees for a given set of terminal taxa opens up additional possibilities for automated tree comparison tools.

Conclusion
There are many scenarios in which researchers might want
to assemble a dataset of aligned DNA or protein
sequences with a view to phylogenetic analysis. Current
approaches require assembling such datasets manually or,
at best, using software tools that lack integration. TaxMan
greatly facilitates the various steps required for a multigene phylogenetic study by extracting sequences from
public databases, building and aligning consensus
sequences, choosing sets of data for analysis and storing
the results of analysis. By using a relational database to
store data, along with existing bioinformatics tools and a
Perl framework, TaxMan allows large datasets to be assembled extremely rapidly and with full data provenance,
allowing the user to concentrate on the analysis.
