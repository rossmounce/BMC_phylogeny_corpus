Abstract
Background: In plants, tandem, segmental and whole-genome duplications are prevalent, resulting
in large numbers of duplicate loci. Recent studies suggest that duplicate genes diverge
predominantly through the partitioning of expression and that breadth of gene expression is
related to the rate of gene duplication and protein sequence evolution.
Here, we utilize expressed sequence tag (EST) data to study gene duplication and expression
patterns in the monosaccharide transporter (MST) gene family across the land plants. In Arabidopsis,
there are 53 MST genes that form seven distinct subfamilies. We created profile hidden Markov
models of each subfamily and searched EST databases representing diverse land plant lineages to
address the following questions: 1) Are homologs of each Arabidopsis subfamily present in the
earliest land plants? 2) Do expression patterns among subfamilies and individual genes within
subfamilies differ across lineages? 3) Has gene duplication within each lineage resulted in lineagespecific expansion patterns? We also looked for correlations between relative EST database
representation in Arabidopsis and similarity to orthologs in early lineages.
Results: Homologs of all seven MST subfamilies were present in land plants at least 400 million
years ago. Subfamily expression levels vary across lineages with greater relative expression of the
STP, ERD6-like, INT and PLT subfamilies in the vascular plants. In the large EST databases of the
moss, gymnosperm, monocot and eudicot lineages, EST contig construction reveals that MST
subfamilies have experienced lineage-specific expansions. Large subfamily expansions appear to be
due to multiple gene duplications arising from single ancestral genes. In Arabidopsis, one or a few
genes within most subfamilies have much higher EST database representation than others. Most
highly represented (broadly expressed) genes in Arabidopsis have best match orthologs in early
divergent lineages.
Conclusion: The seven subfamilies of the Arabidopsis MST gene family are ancient in land plants
and show differential subfamily expression and lineage-specific subfamily expansions. Patterns of
gene expression in Arabidopsis and correlation of highly represented genes with best match
homologs in early lineages suggests that broadly expressed genes are often highly conserved, and
that most genes have more limited expression.

Background
Large proportions of genes within genomes are members
of hierarchical gene families and superfamilies. Gene families appear to evolve through a combination of tandem,
segmental and whole genome duplication (polyploidy)
events. A number of researchers in the first half of the
twentieth century observed relationships between chromosome duplications and morphological variation [1]. In
1970, Ohno [2] argued that, because natural selection is
inherently conservative, major genetic novelty can arise
only through gene duplication events where purifying
selection is relaxed on one of the duplicates. The classical
model of the fates of duplicate genes [2-4] predicts that
most gene duplicates are lost due to deleterious mutations
and that new function arises only with rare beneficial
mutations resulting from neutral processes.
More recent theoretical and empirical work suggests that
gene duplicates are retained more frequently than the classical model permits and that new function or expression
arises through the processes of neo- and subfunctionalization [5,6]. In subfunctionalization, expression or function
present in a progenitor gene is partitioned between
daughter genes through complementary mutations to regulatory or coding regions [7]. In neofunctionalization,
related or novel function may arise in one of the duplicates through initial relaxation of purifying selection with
accumulation of mutations conferring new function
under either neutral or positive selection. Partitioning of
expression appears to be the most common fate of a fixed
gene duplicate [8,9] and it appears to happen relatively
rapidly after duplication [9]. However, many gene duplicate pairs appear to evolve slowly, suggesting that buffering of crucial functions may be important after gene
duplication events [10].
Plant genomes contain large fractions of duplicate loci
due to the frequent occurrence of segmental duplications
and polyploidy events. Following a polyploidy event,
there is a rapid loss of duplicate loci in the transition to
functional diploidy and the remaining duplicate loci
undergo rapid functional divergence [11]. Recent
genome-scale studies indicate that some types of duplicate genes are retained at higher frequencies than others
[12-14], that highly conserved genes are duplicated and
retained more frequently than more rapidly evolving
genes [15], and that rates of protein evolution may be
related to expression levels [16,17] and patterns, with
genes expressed in multiple tissues under stronger purifying selection [18,19].
In this study, we investigate the monosaccharide transporter (MST) gene family in land plants. MSTs are found
in all three domains of life, have fundamental importance
in carbohydrate flux and are highly conserved across line-

ages. All MST proteins are characterized by 12 hydrophobic membrane-spanning domains separated by
interconnecting cytoplasmic and extracellular loops, with
cytoplasmic N- and C-terminal domains [20]. This highly
conserved protein structure provides a strong signature for
identification of putative MSTs in translated DNA
sequence data, such as ESTs. Most plant MST genes characterized to date show expression in sink tissues and are
thought to function in the uptake of simple sugars from
the apoplast after phloem-unloading and hydrolysis of
sucrose by co-expressed cell wall invertases [21,22]. Most
have been shown to be H+-sugar symporters localized in
the plasma membrane (see references below).
Previous analysis of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome
reveals 53 MST genes that cluster into seven subfamilies
on phylogenetic analysis (Figure 1) [23]. To date, less than
a dozen of these 53 genes have been characterized as to
function and/or expression. The STP subfamily is the best
studied, with published reports on seven of the 14 genes
[24-30]. Only a handful of genes in the other subfamilies,
AtERD6 [31], AtSFP1 [32], AtpGlcT [33], AtPLT5 [34], and
AtINT4 [35] have been studied. However, a number of
MSTs in green algae [36] and other higher plants
[20,33,37-40] have been investigated, contributing to our
understanding of the functional diversity of this gene family in the green plants as a whole. Because some of these
proteins have been documented to transport sugar alcohols, this gene family is named the MST(-like) gene family
on the TAIR website [41]. For simplicity, we will refer to
all genes in the MST(-like) family as MST genes.
The great diversity of land plants on Earth today is
strongly supported as a monophyletic clade [42,43]. As
such, it presents an opportunity to study gene family evolution in major lineages that differ greatly in structural
complexity and life histories. Land plants consist broadly
of primitive nonvascular and more complex vascular
plants. The small, structurally simple nonvascular plants
are composed of three major groups, the liverworts,
mosses, and hornworts, collectively known as "the bryophytes." In bryophytes, the small diploid sporophyte is
epiphytic on the dominant, leafy haploid gametophyte.
Lycophytes are the earliest divergent vascular plants represented today by only a few extant lineages, the club
mosses (Lycopodiaceae), spike mosses (Selaginellaceae),
and quillworts (Isoetaceae). The pteridophytes are composed of three lineages of ferns (Ophioglossaceae, Marattiales, and Polypodiales), the horsetails (Equisetum) and
whisk ferns (Psilotaceae) that form a monophyletic group
which is sister to the seed plants [44]. Seed plants are composed of four groups of gymnosperms (conifers, cycads,
ginkgos and gnetophytes) and the angiosperms (flowering plants). All land plants exhibit alternation of generations, the formation of a multicellular body in both the

haploid and diploid phase of the life cycle. However, in
contrast to the non-vascular bryophytes, all vascular plant
lineages are characterized by life histories in which the
diploid sporophyte is dominant and the haploid gametophyte is much reduced in size. In the seed plants (especially the flowering plants), the gametophytes are most
reduced in size and nutritionally dependent upon the sporophyte.
Because the common ancestor of land plants is inferred to
have had a haploid-dominant life cycle [42,45,46],
hypotheses regarding gene expression in the simple gametophyte versus the complex sporophyte have focused
around the idea that sporophyte genes were 'recruited'
from the haploid gametophyte genome in the early evolution of land plants, resulting in overlapping expression of
identical genes in both generations [47-49]. Hypotheses
that integrate the potentially significant role of gene
duplication and divergence in the early evolution of the
complex sporophyte have begun to be developed and

tested [45,50]. The study of specific gene families in the
earliest land plant lineages with dominant or independent gametophytes may help to answer these questions.
Analyzing a complete genome sequence is the only
method whereby all members of a gene family can be
identified with certainty. At the time of this study, complete plant genome sequences are available for Arabidopsis
thaliana and Oryza sativa (rice). However, large EST databases (>100,000 ESTs) derived from multiple tissues,
developmental stages and experimental conditions represent a resource for studying the genomes of species with
unsequenced genomes through their transcriptomes.
Large EST databases are available for many important crop
plants across the monocot and eudicot flowering plants.
However, only two large EST databases are available for
earlier divergent land plants: the moss Physcomitrella patens [49] and the gymnosperm Pinus taeda (loblolly pine)
[51]. Small EST databases exist for several species belonging to other major early land plant lineages including a

liverwort, Marchantia polymorpha, a lycophyte, Selaginella
lepidophylla, and the fern Ceratopteris richardii. Each of
these small databases is derived from limited tissue types,
the Marchantia library constructed from sex organ tissues
(gametophyte), the Selaginella database from dessicated
frond (sporophyte), and the Ceratopteris library from germinating spores (gametophyte). We searched the large
EST databases of Zea mays (corn), Lycopersicon esculentum
(tomato), Pinus taeda, Physcomitrella patens and Arabidopsis
thaliana. We also searched the small Marchantia, Selaginella and Ceratopteris EST databases described above.

database to determine relative representation of each MST
gene (and to provide a comparison for evaluating the
effectiveness of our profile HMMs at identifying ESTs in
other species); (5) a search of EST databases of other
major land plant lineages (described above) for ESTs
belonging to each MST subfamily; (6) creation of EST contigs to infer the number of expressed MST loci present in
each large EST database; and (7) correlation of Arabidopsis
MST genes with high EST database representation with
best match homologs in early divergent lineages.

Results
To search these databases, we constructed profile hidden
Markov models (HMMs) of each MST subfamily. Profile
HMMs are probabilistic models representing an alignment of multiple amino acid sequences that are very effective at identifying related sequences [52]. To build a
profile HMM of a particular protein family, a multiple
sequence alignment containing sequences from as diverse
an assembly of species as possible is created in order to
properly represent both the conserved and divergent
regions across the protein family. The resulting profile
HMMs (or consensus protein sequences created from
them) can be used to search EST databases with software
such as the Wise2 package [53].
Given that MSTs are ubiquitous across all three domains
of life and that homologs of each of the seven Arabidopsis
subfamilies have been found in many vascular plant species as well as the green alga Chlorella kessleri, we hypothesize that the seven subfamilies of MST genes identified in
Arabidopsis are ancient, with ancestral homologs of each
subfamily likely present in the earliest land plants. Second, given the prevalence of individual gene, segmental
chromosome and whole genome duplications within the
land plants, the MST subfamilies are likely to have unique
expansion patterns within lineages. Third, if partitioning
of expression is the most prevalent fate of duplicate genes,
then we would expect to find unique patterns of MST gene
expression across lineages. Last, if broadly expressed genes
are more conserved than narrowly expressed genes, then
Arabidopsis genes with broad expression should be most
similar to orthologs in the earliest lineages. We infer
breadth of expression of Arabidopsis MST genes based on
their relative representation, within subfamily, in the
combined EST database along with an evaluation of
microarray data.
To investigate these questions, our study consisted of the
following analyses: (1) construction of a statistically
robust phylogenetic tree of Arabidopsis MST proteins; (2)
mapping of each Arabidopsis MST gene to determine segmental and tandem gene duplications; (3) construction of
profile HMMs and consensus protein sequences for each
MST subfamily; (4) a search of the large Arabidopsis EST

Phylogenetic analysis and mapping of the MST gene family
in Arabidopsis
Phylogenetic analysis of the 53 Arabidopsis MST protein
sequences using the maximum likelihood (ML) method
(Figure 1) revealed a phylogeny in agreement with the
phylogeny posted on the Arabidopsis Sugar Transporter
homepage [23], with one notable exception: In our ML
tree, the AtSTP13 protein clusters at the base of the subclade containing the AtSTP2, -6 and -8 genes, rather than
grouping with the AtSTP14 and AtSTP7 genes. The bootstrap value for this arrangement is quite low at 36, indicating an unresolved node. However, mapping the STP genes
on the Arabidopsis chromosomes (Additional file 1) supports a close relationship between AtSTP6 and AtSTP13 as
a result of a segmental duplication event involving these
two genes. Across the tree, most bootstrap values were 90
or higher, with all seven nodes at the base of each subfamily clade having bootstrap values of 100. A consensus
maximum parsimony (MP) tree of all 53 MST protein
sequences with 10,000 bootstrap replicates revealed a
topology that was essentially the same as the ML topology
with similar support values among most genes (not
shown). Nodes with low bootstrap support values on the
ML tree are represented by polytomies on the MP tree. In
our MP tree, the AtSTP13 gene forms a polytomy with four
other STP gene groups, including the AtSTP7-14 and
AtSTP2-6-8 groups. The chromosome map of all 53 MST
genes (Additional file 1) reveals six regions of tandem
gene duplications, four of which involve ERD6-like genes.
Segmental duplications are present in all subfamilies
except the pGlcT subfamily.
Construction of profile hidden Markov models and
consensus sequences
We searched the Protein Families (pfam) database [54] for
all full-length or nearly full-length non-Arabidopsis MST
genes within the viridiplantae clade. This resulted in a set
of 62 MST genes from 25 different species (Additional file
2). Of the 62 MST genes, 30 were from monocot species,
31 from eudicot species, and one from the gymnosperm
Picea abies. These were combined with the 53 Arabidopsis
MST genes [23], three Chlorella kessleri hexose transporters
(CkHUP1-3), and two partial Ceratopteris richardii MST

genes (CrMST1-2), for a total of 120 MST genes. Each of
the MST subfamily profile HMMs is available as a separate
file (Additional files 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). An alignment of the
consensus sequences generated from each subfamily profile HMM shows the AZT subfamily to have a large central
loop, the INT subfamily to have an expanded region from
amino acids 749â824, and the XyloseTP homologs to
have a long N-terminal domain (Additional file 10).
Three-dimensional protein structures are not available for
any of these proteins.
Summary of EST database search results
The percentage of identified MST genes in each EST database varies from 0.05% in Lycopersicon to 0.28% in Arabidopsis, with an average of 0.09% (Table 1). In the large EST
databases, differences in relative proportions of ESTs from
each of the seven subfamilies also vary across the land
plant lineages. In Physcomitrella, the AZT and pGlcT subfamilies each represent 37.5% of the total MST ESTs, for a
total of 75%. However, in the vascular and flowering
plants, especially in the dicot lineages, the STP and ERD6like subfamilies appear to have increased expression levels
relative to the other subfamilies, with the STP ESTs comprising 43.9% of total MST ESTs in Arabidopsis and the
ERD6-like ESTs comprising 35.5% of total MST ESTs in
Lycopersicon. In the very small EST databases of the early

Arabidopsis thaliana EST database search
The proportion of known MST genes represented in the
Arabidopsis EST database of 415,250 ESTs was 83% (44/53
genes) (Figure 2). Genes not represented in the database
were AtSTP2, -6, -10, -11, AZT subfamily locus At3g51490,
ERD6-like subfamily locus At3g20460, and AtPLT1, -2,
and -3. Four subfamilies (STP, pGlcT, INT and PLT)
showed a pattern in which one or a few genes had much
higher representation in the EST database than any of the
remaining expressed genes. In the STP subfamily, AtSTP1
had the highest representation in the EST database overall,
with 377 ESTs expressed in a variety of tissues, stages and
conditions. In the pGlcT subfamily, AtpGlcT exhibited a
nearly 3-fold higher representation than the next most
abundantly represented gene, as did AtINT1 in the INT
subfamily. In the PLT subfamily, AtPLT5 had a 9- and 23fold greater representation than AtPLT4 and AtPLT6
respectively. In the AZT, ERD6-like, and XyloseTP-like
subfamilies, representation of gene subfamily members
was more evenly distributed. Contig assembly (with a
95% overlap identity cutoff) of Arabidopsis ESTs revealed
the presence of multiple contigs for most genes (data not
shown). One or more gaps in sequence distinguished the

Small EST database searches
Expressed MST genes were identified in all seven subfamilies from at least one of the three small EST databases
of the early divergent plant lineages (Figure 3). Specifi-

cally, two ESTs were identified in Marchantia (STP subfamily), two in Selaginella (pGlcT and ERD6-like
subfamilies) and six ESTs in Ceratopteris (all subfamilies
except ERD6-like). Details regarding the EST records and

revealed a minimum of 18 expressed loci across the seven
MST subfamilies (Figure 4). No ESTs showing similarity to
the PLT subfamily were identified. Details regarding the

Contig assembly and analysis revealed a minimum of 62
expressed loci across the seven MST subfamilies (Figure

there are several cases of subfamily expansion due to mul-

tiple gene duplications along a single gene lineage. For
example, in the STP subfamily, ten expressed loci show
highest similarity to the ATSTP7 gene, suggesting multiple
rounds of gene duplication (probably tandem) arising
from the ancestral STP7 ortholog in Pinus taeda. Similar
gene duplication clusters are present in the ERD6-like,
PLT, and INT subfamilies, resulting in large expansions of
these subfamilies.

there is evidence of subfamily expansion due to multiple
gene duplications arising from individual ancestral
orthologs. However, the number of duplications in Zea
(as seen in this EST data) does not exceed four in any single case.

low number of MST ESTs present in the relatively large
EST database with a concordant low number of expressed
loci. A likely reason for this is ascertainment bias in the
cDNA libraries from which the ESTs were derived. However, a review of the tissue and organ types, developmental stages and growth conditions represented in the EST
database reveals them to be varied, including callus, leaf,

Discussion
The seven subfamilies of MST genes are ancient
The results of our EST database searches confirm that all
of the Arabidopsis MST subfamilies but one, the PLT
(polyol transporter) subfamily, are found in the EST database of the early divergent moss lineage (Physcomitrella
patens), dating back >410 million years ago. Because polyols are known osmoprotectants in stress conditions and
many bryophytes are known to leach sugars and polyols

after freeze-thaw events in cold temperature environments [55], it seems likely that bryophytes possess polyol
transporters. Physcomitrella patens, specifically, has been
shown to be drought, salt and freezing-tolerant [56,57].

were derived from ABA-treated gametophytes (1.8% of
total ESTs in the clustered Physcomitrella EST database). It

may be that expression of PLT genes in Physcomitrella patens is induced by stress and that stress-induced genes are
significantly underrepresented in the clustered Physcomitrella EST database, resulting in the absence of many
stress-induced genes in the database. However, absence of
this subfamily of transporters in this species may also be
real. The earliest divergent lineage in which we found ESTs
from the PLT subfamily is the fern lineage (Ceratopteris
richardii), which diverged from its common ancestor with
the seed plants approximately 400 million years ago. We
found no expressed PLT genes in the EST database of the

lycophyte Selaginella lepidophylla, but absence of this subfamily from this EST database may be an artifact of its
small size (1,046 ESTs).
MST gene family size varies across lineages
The total number of expressed MST loci in each species
varied from 18 to 64 in the five lineages with large EST
databases. Not surprisingly, the smallest number of
expressed MST loci (18) was found in the early divergent
moss, Physcomitrella patens. The largest number of
expressed MST loci (64) was found in the gymnosperm

Pinus taeda, with the angiosperms Zea mays and Arabidopsis
thaliana having similar numbers of expressed MST loci (46
and 44 respectively). Interestingly, the number of
expressed MST loci in the Lycopersicon esculentum EST database, at 24, is almost half as large as the number of
expressed loci in the Zea and Arabidopsis databases, and
not much larger than the number of loci expressed in the
nonvascular moss. Possible explanations include a significant bias in the Lycopersicon database or a paucity of large
and/or small-scale gene duplication events in the Lycoper-

sicon lineage, resulting in small gene family sizes compared to lineages in which gene duplication events have
been more numerous. Given that the cDNA libraries from
which the Lycopersicon ESTs were derived appear to be as
varied in tissue/organ type and developmental stage as the
other large EST databases analyzed, it appears likely that
bias in the database does not completely explain the low
numbers of expressed MSTs. Comparison of sequenced
segments of the tomato genome with the Arabidopsis
genome reveals multiple large-scale genome duplications

are present in Arabidopsis [58] but not Lycopersicon, suggesting that the low numbers of expressed MST loci in
tomato may be a result, at least in part, of fewer large-scale
genome duplication events in its evolutionary history. A
lower level of tandem gene duplication events (at least in
the MST gene family) may also be a factor in the low
number of expressed MST loci.

divergent liverwort, moss, and lycophyte lineages, but percentages of MST ESTs identified in the liverwort, moss and
lycophyte databases are higher (0.10â0.19%) than in Lycopersicon and Zea. It seems noteworthy that the percentage
of MST ESTs in the Arabidopsis database is substantially
higher (0.28%) than in any of the other species (0.05â
0.19%).

MST subfamily expression levels differ across lineages
The relative expression level of most subfamilies, inferred
from these EST data, appears to have changed across the
major land plant lineages, with the AZT and pGlcT gene
subfamilies having much greater proportional expression
in the early moss lineage (37.5% each for AZT and pGlcT)
than in the gymnosperm (2.6% and 21.1%), monocot
(16.3% and 13.1%) and eudicot lineages (averages of
3.4% and 7.4%) (Table 1). Conversely, proportional
expression levels of the STP subfamily are greatly
increased in the gymnosperm and angiosperm lineages
(an average of 30%) as compared to the moss (9.7%). Relative expression levels of the ERD6-like subfamily also
show an increase from the lowest levels in the moss
(3.5%) through the gymnosperm (11.9%), monocot
(19.9%) and eudicot lineages (average of 33%). It is possible that these differences in relative expression levels for
each subfamily reflect bias in the cDNA libraries from
which the ESTs in each database were derived. However,
since each of the large databases contains large numbers
of ESTs derived from whole plant tissue and major organ
tissues under different conditions, it is likely that these
data do reflect some real differences in relative subfamily
expression. In the absence of functional characterization
and expression studies for genes in each of the subfamilies, it is premature to speculate about the functional
significance of these relative expression differences. However, given that monosaccharide transporters are associated with a variety of sink tissues, co-expressed cell wall
invertases and phloem unloading in the vascular plants
[21], we would predict an increase in size and complexity
of this gene family. Increased expression and expansion of
the STP, ERD6-like, INT and PLT subfamilies in the vascular plants, therefore, may reflect the evolution of structural
and physiological complexity associated with vascularity.

MST gene expression in Arabidopsis
In this large database of 415,250 ESTs, derived from multiple plant stages, tissue types and treatments, we found
ESTs representing 44 of the 53 known MST genes (83%).
Of the nine genes for which we found no ESTs, the function and expression of three are known. Interestingly,
these three genes (AtSTP2, -6, and -9) are expressed in
developing pollen only (the haploid male gametophyte).
One other gene known to be expressed in pollen only is
AtSTP11, for which we found one EST derived from a mixture of silique and flower tissue. Absence of the AtSTP2, 6 and -9 genes from the Arabidopsis EST database, then,
seems likely due to the paucity of transcripts from pollen
development in the database. This invites speculation that
some or all of the six other genes missing from the database may also be expressed in gametophyte tissue only.
An evaluation of microarray gene expression data contained on the Weigel World website (AtGenExpress Development) [59,60] reveals that of the six remaining missing
MST genes, three have expression profiles consistent with
pollen-specific expression (AtSTP10, AtPLT1, and
AttMT3), with one gene not present on the array (AtPLT2).
An examination of the adaptive significance of Arabidopsis
MST gene expression in relation to rates of sequence evolution is currently underway in our laboratory (data
unpublished).

In addition, the proportion of MST ESTs identified in each
of the databases varied between 0.05% in Lycopersicon and
0.28% in Arabidopsis (Table 1) with an average of 0.13%.
The small EST databases showed percentages of MST ESTs
ranging from 0.12â0.19%. A potential source of differences in relative proportion of MST ESTs identified in each
EST database is a bias in the sequences from which the
profile HMMs were constructed. However, this seems
unlikely, given that there was one gymnosperm, many
monocot and two Lycopersicon MST sequences included in
the profile HMM sequence set and none for the very early

Overall patterns of individual MST gene EST database representation in some subfamilies reveal that one, or a few,
genes have significantly greater representation than the
others. For example, in the STP subfamily, AtSTP1
(74.8%), AtSTP13 (10.7%) and AtSTP4 (7.9%) make up
93.4% of 10 represented STP genes. In the PLT subfamily,
the AtPLT5 gene makes up 87.2% of total subfamily representation. In the greatly expanded ERD6-like subfamily,
however, gene representation is apportioned more equitably with most genes ranging between 3% and 10% of the
total EST database representation. The ERD6-like gene
with the highest representation (18.6%) is AtSFP1. The
large expansion of this subfamily is due to tandem duplications involving four clusters of genes, with no other Arabidopsis MST subfamily showing this high level of tandem
duplication. Most of the highly represented ERD6-like
genes are members of these tandem arrays.
High representation of a specific gene in the combined
Arabidopsis EST database may be the result of high expres-

sion (transcript levels) in one or more organs or lower
expression in many different organs (broad expression).
However, many cDNA libraries from which ESTs are
derived are normalized, eliminating redundant transcripts
of genes with high or broad expression and increasing the
relative proportion of transcripts from genes with low or
narrow expression. Thus, there may be genes with relatively low representation in the EST database that are, in
fact, more broadly or highly expressed than indicated by
their relative presence in the database.
The MST subfamilies have lineage-specific expansion
patterns
Our data present clear evidence that the MST subfamilies
have experienced lineage-specific expansions across the
land plant family tree (Table 1 and Figure 8). In the earliest lineage with a large EST database, Physcomitrella patens,
each subfamily is comparatively small (between one and
five expressed loci) (Figure 4) relative to the gymnosperm
and angiosperm lineages. Its two largest subfamilies, AZT
and pGlcT, each have five expressed loci. In the AZT subfamily, four loci appear to be the result of repeated duplications arising in the ancestral AttMT2 gene lineage. In the
pGlcT subfamily, three loci appear to be the result of

duplications arising in the ancestral AtpGlcT gene lineage.
The gymnosperm Pinus taeda has four expanded subfamilies, STP, ERD6-like, INT, and PLT (Figure 5). Almost
half of the STP subfamily expansion in Pinus taeda is the
result of ten duplications in the ancestral AtSTP7 gene lineage. In the INT subfamily, eight duplications in the
ancestral AtINT2 gene lineage and four gene duplications
in the ancestral AtINT1 gene lineage result in 86% of
expressed loci. The monocot angiosperm Zea mays has
three expanded subfamilies, STP, ERD6-like and PLT (Figure 6). In the STP subfamily, two ancestral genes orthologous to AtSTP5 and AtSTP1 each experienced four gene
duplications, resulting in more than half of the Zea mays
STP genes. The eudicot angiosperm Lycopersicon esculentum has two slightly expanded subfamilies, STP and
ERD6-like, but there are no instances where more than
two expressed loci appear to have been duplicated from
one ancestral gene lineage (Figure 7). In Arabidopsis the
STP and ERD6-like subfamilies are large. Mapping of
duplication events on the phylogeny (Figure 9) reveals
three segmental duplications and one tandem duplication
discernible in the STP subfamily. Two segmental duplications (one involving two genes) and six apparent tandem
duplications have resulted in the large expansion of the

ERD6-like subfamily. Differences in subfamily size
among the monocot and dicot rosid and asterid lineages
are likely correlated to the number of whole genome
duplication events in their evolutionary histories (Figure
8). A recent analysis of EST data and completed genome
sequence for 14 model plant species has inferred three
polyploidy events in the monocot lineage, three in the
dicot rosid lineage but only two in the dicot asterid lineage [61] (Figure 8). This likely explains, at least in part, the
relatively lower number of expressed loci in the Lycopersicon lineage.

another in mammals [19] present strong evidence that
genes with broad expression are under stronger purifying
selection than genes with tissue-specific expression. Two
models have been proposed to explain this: (1) A protein
with broad expression would be exposed to more diverse
biochemical environments and, hence, would be under
stronger purifying selection [18]. (2) A broadly expressed
protein with a deleterious mutation would most likely
have a greater impact on organismal fitness than a protein
with narrow, tissue-specific expression and would, thus,
experience greater purifying selection [19].

Is broad Arabidopsis MST gene expression correlated with
the presence of orthologs in early lineages?
High gene expression levels have been associated with
slow sequence evolution rates in yeast [16] and eukaryotes [17]. In addition, a study in vertebrates [18] and

ies. We assumed that, because the combined Arabidopsis
EST database is derived from many different tissues, developmental stages and growth conditions, an Arabidopsis
gene with high representation in the database, relative to
other members of its subfamily, is likely a gene with high
and/or broad expression, and a gene with low representation is likely a gene with low and/or narrow expression.
We evaluated this assumption with an analysis of the
AtGenExpress Arabidopsis developmental microarray gene
expression data [60]. An expressed gene in an early divergent lineage with a best match to an Arabidopsis gene was
used an as indication that the Arabidopsis gene is evolving
relatively slowly under strong purifying selection.
Of 13 MST genes with relatively high subfamily representation, 11 have best match homologs in one or more of
the five early divergent land plants included in our study
(liverwort, moss, lycophyte, fern, or gymnosperm) (Figure
10). Of these, the expression of three (AtSTP1, AtSTP4,
and AtPLT5) has been characterized and can be considered broad, i.e., expressed in multiple organs and develop-

mental stages. AtSTP1 is expressed in germinating seeds
and seedlings, concentrated in the root, and also in guard
cells [26,27]. STP4 is expressed in classic sink tissues such
as root tips, pollen and anthers and in tissues damaged by
environmental stresses [28]. PLT5 is expressed most
strongly in roots but also in vascular tissue of leaves and
in floral organs [34]. Microarray expression profiles from
the developmental AtGenExpress dataset reveal that all of
the MST genes we identified with high representation in
the EST database (with the exception of At3g51490 which
is not present on the array) have profiles consistent with
broad expression across three or more major plant structures (root, stem, leaf, flower, and/or seed). The two
ERD6-like subfamily genes with high EST database representation that lack the presence of orthologs in early lineages also have microarray profiles consistent with broad
expression. These two genes are both members of a large
subclade of tandemly duplicated genes in the ERD6-like
subfamily and may have undergone substantial divergence from an ancestral gene present in an early lineage.
Of the five MST genes with relatively low, or no, represen-

tation in the database and best match homologs in early
lineages, three (AtSTP7, At5g18840, and AtINT2) have
microarray expression profiles consistent with broad
expression and two (At3g51490 and AtPLT4) appear to
have limited expression, including expression in pollen.
The broadly expressed genes may have low EST database
representation as a result of normalized cDNA libraries
and/or because they have low expression levels (making
our analysis of the correlation between high EST database
representation and the presence of orthologs in early lineages conservative). The genes expressed in pollen may be
conserved descendants of ancestral MST genes present in
the earliest land plants, and thus have orthologs present in
the extant members of these early lineages.
Implications for the role of MST gene duplication in early
land plant evolution
Previous comparison of a large collection of Physcomitrella
ESTs with protein sequences from the Arabidopsis genome
[49] concluded that the Physcomitrella gametophyte transcriptome was 'quite similar' to the Arabidopsis genome,
supporting the hypothesis that genes expressed in the sporophytes of higher plants were 'recruited' from genes
expressed in the gametophytes of early land plant ancestors, resulting in a set of 'shared genes' in the two lineages.
However, if gene duplication events are prevalent in
plants and the most common fate of retained gene duplicates is a partitioning of gene expression, a large number
of Arabidopsis genes that show similarity to genes
expressed in the Physcomitrella gametophyte are likely to
be paralogs, and not direct descendants of the same genes
expressed in the gametophyte of a common ancestor. A
recent genome-scale comparison of the Arabidopsis male
gametophyte (pollen) transcriptome with the sporophyte
transcriptome revealed a 61% overlap in expression of
992 pollen-expressed mRNAs, with nearly 40% of these
showing pollen-specificity [62]. Our analysis of MST gene
transcripts represented in the Arabidopsis EST database and
the AtGenExpress microarray expression data suggests that
at least seven of the 43 MSTs may be gametophyte-specific.

Our comparison of MST genes in the transcriptomes of
Physcomitrella patens, Pinus taeda, Zea mays and Lycopersicon
esculentum with the known MST gene family in Arabidopsis
thaliana also allowed us to identify significant differences
in size between the STP and ERD6-like subfamilies in the
nonvascular moss lineage and the vascular gymnosperm
and angiosperm lineages, suggesting that expansion of
these subfamilies is potentially related to the evolution of
the vascular sporophyte. Hypotheses about the origin and
evolution of the complex vascular sporophyte must
include explicit ideas about the role of gene duplication
and divergence in the expression of genes in the separate
haploid and diploid phases of the plant life cycle. The sig-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/64

nificance of MST gene duplication on plant life cycle evolution remains to be revealed through appropriate
empirical studies.

Conclusion
The subfamilies of MST genes present in Arabidopsis are
ancient, with six of the seven subfamilies (STP, AZT,
ERD6-like, pGlcT, INT and XyloseTP homologs) found in
the moss lineage, which diverged from its common ancestor with the vascular plants >410 million years ago.
Among the EST databases that we searched, the earliest
lineage in which a homolog of the PLT subfamily was
identified was the fern lineage, which diverged from its
common ancestor with the vascular plants about 400 million years ago. The PLT subfamily may be present in earlier lineages but developmental or environmental
conditions under which these transporters are expressed
may not be present in the EST databases.
The MST subfamilies also show lineage-specific subfamily
expansion patterns. Subfamily expansion in the vascular
plants often appears to be due to multiple gene duplications arising from a single ancestral gene (likely tandem
duplications) within a subfamily. In Arabidopsis, the large
expansion of the ERD6-like subfamily is due to four clusters of tandem duplications involving 68% of subfamily
genes.
Relative subfamily expression levels, inferred from EST
data, vary across lineages. There is greater expression of
the STP and ERD6-like subfamilies in the gymnosperm
and flowering plant lineages, with relatively high expression of the AZT and pGlcT subfamilies in the nonvascular
moss lineage. These differences may reflect increased roles
of the STP and ERD6-like subfamilies in the long-distance
transport of sugars in vascular plants.
EST database representation of individual Arabidopsis
genes indicates that one or a few genes within a subfamily
often have much higher representation than others. These
patterns are consistent with models of gene duplicate
divergence in which a gene duplicate assumes a portion of
the function and/or expression of a progenitor gene having broad function and/or expression. However, the largest Arabidopsis subfamily, the ERD6-like subfamily, does
not fit this pattern, with a large number of tandem gene
duplicates having more equitable EST database representation.
Correlation of Arabidopsis genes with high EST database
representation with the presence of orthologs in early lineages reveals that 11 of 13 highly represented genes (85%)
have best match homologs. This is consistent with
hypotheses that genes with high and/or broad expression
are more conserved than genes with narrow expression.

Of the five Arabidopsis genes with little or no representation in the database that also had best match homologs in
early lineages, three had microarray expression profiles
consistent with broad expression and two had more narrow expression patterns, including expression in pollen
(male gametophyte). These genes expressed in the haploid phase may be conserved descendants of ancestral
genes expressed in the dominant or independent haploid
phase of early land plants and, in the absence of another
allele, are likely to be under strong purifying selection.

Methods
Phylogenetic analysis and gene mapping
Phylogenetic analysis of the 53 Arabidopsis MST protein
sequences using maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony was performed. A maximum likelihood tree with
100 bootstrap replicates was constructed with the PHYML
program [63] using the JTT amino acid substitution
model, a discrete gamma model with four categories and
an estimated shape parameter of 1.385. A consensus maximum parsimony tree was constructed with PAUP*, version 4.0 beta 10, with 10,000 bootstrap replicates using
the tree-bisection-reconnection branch-swapping heuristic search algorithm. All 53 Arabidopsis MST genes were
mapped onto the five Arabidopsis chromosomes using the
TIGR locus tags and the TAIR Chromosome Map Tool
[64]. Segmental chromosome duplications were identified using the TIGR Arabidopsis thaliana Genome Annotation database [65].
Profile hidden Markov models and consensus sequences
One hundred twenty MST genes from across the green
plant lineage were assembled by searching the pfam database for all full- or nearly full-length MST genes in the
viridiplantae (62 sequences), combining these with the 53
Arabidopsis MST genes reported on the TAIR Arabidopsis
Monosaccharide Transporter(-like) Gene Family website
[41], three green algal (Chlorella kessleri) MST genes (accession #'s P15686, Q39524, Q39525), and two partial fern
(Ceratopteris richardii) MST genes (accession #'s
DQ866147 and DQ866148). The fern genes were amplified by degenerate PCR in our laboratory and translated
based on BLASTX searches. The 120 protein sequences
were aligned with ClustalW [66] and a neighbor-joining
phylogenetic tree was produced with PAUP* 4.0 Beta 10
[67] to determine the subfamily identity of each MST
sequence. Each subfamily group of protein sequences was
then realigned with ClustalW and a profile HMM and consensus sequence produced with the HMMER software
package [68], version 2.3.2.

dopsis thaliana, and Lycopersicon esculentum) were
downloaded from the NCBI website and installed on our
local server. Each database was searched using the estwisedb component of the Wise2 package [53], version
2.1.20, and the profile HMM-based consensus sequence
for each MST subfamily. For the large EST databases, custom Perl scripts were written to automate the retrieval of
FASTA files of EST sequences with significant e-values (<
1e-10) and to perform BLASTX searches against the Arabidopsis refseq database to identify the best match Arabidopsis gene for each EST sequence. Alignments of each
translated EST sequence with its best match Arabidopsis
gene were reviewed to confirm identity of each EST as a
member of one of the seven MST subfamilies. The accession number for each positive EST sequence, locus tag for
best match Arabidopsis MST gene, BLASTX e-value and
cDNA library description were recorded in Excel spreadsheets for each EST database (Additional files 11, 12, 13,
14, 15, 16).
Contig assembly and analysis
EST sequences showing a best match to the same Arabidopsis MST gene were assembled into contigs with the CAP3
program [69], using default parameters (75% overlap
identity cutoff) for all species except Arabidopsis. For Arabidopsis we used a 95% overlap identity cutoff to exclude
ESTs with significant sequencing errors and to combine
ESTs from different alternative splicing isoforms into separate contigs. Expressed loci in each of the large non-Arabidopsis EST databases were determined by comparison
of BLASTX alignments of EST contigs and singlets with
their best match Arabidopsis MST protein. Separate EST
contigs or singlets with significant overlap (>50 amino
acids) and a best match to the same Arabidopsis MST gene
but with different amino acid sequence were deemed to
be different loci.
