Abstract
Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a novel class of gene expression regulators implicated in
cancer biology. Neuroblastoma (NB) is an embryonal tumour consisting of neural crest-derived
undifferentiated cells and is characterised by variable clinical courses ranging from spontaneous
regression to therapy-resistant progression. Recent advances identified a subset of miRNAs with
putative function in NB biology. However, the full repertoire of miRNAs expressed in NBs is not
available.
Results: We describe miRNA profiles of 13 NB specimens and 2 NB cell lines as determined by
miRNA cloning. A total of 3153 sequences were sequenced and analysed by a miRNA prediction
tool (miRpredict). Our library covered 27% miRNAs known to date. 39 reads corresponding to 25
individual sequences were classified as novel miRNAs, including miRNA* species of 10 known
miRNAs. Expression of 5 new miRNA* forms and 8 individual sequences was supported by
Northern blotting. Most of the novel miRNA genes are not related to each other and do not share
homology with the annotated sequences in the public miRNA database, but they are conserved
within mammals or have close homologues in primates genomes.
Conclusion: We provide evidence for 29 new miRNA and miRNA-like sequences (24 novel
sequences and 5 miRNAs discovered initially in other species). Some of these newly identified
sequences reside within frequently altered chromosomal regions in NB tumours and may play a
role in NB biology.

Background
Neuroblastoma is the second commonest solid cancer in
young children accounting for 9% of all childhood cancers. It is characterised by a heterogeneous clinical behaviour ranging from spontaneous regression in 10% of all
cases to rapid progression with unfavourable prognosis
[1,2]. Amplified MYCN leading to high MYCN mRNA and

protein levels plays an important role in NB biology and
is used as a powerful prognostic marker in NB risk stratification. In addition, several other genetic abnormalities,
including gain of 17q, 11q and 1p deletion have been
associated with an aggressive NB phenotype [3]. Further,
microarray technology has been used to study gene
expression profiles in primary NBs. Patterns of differen-

tially expressed genes among different NB subtypes as well
as gene expression classifiers have emerged allowing a better prediction of patient's outcome than established risk
markers [4,5].
MiRNAs that regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level have been described to play a role in carcinogenesis via executing oncogenic or tumour suppressive
functions [6-8]. For example, let-7 miRNAs are down-regulated in lung cancer and are known to target proto-oncogene RAS transcripts [9]. Mir-17-92 cistron is to be
overexpressed in human lung cancer and upregulated by
c-Myc [10,11]. miR-15 and miR-16 are frequently deleted
and down-regulated in chronic lymphocytic leukemias
[12]. The expression profiles of a small set of miRNAs
could be used to classify different types of cancer [13-15].
More recently, profiling of a subset of known miRNAs in
neuroblastoma specimens suggested that MYCN acts as a
regulator of miRNAs [16].

MiRNA cloning and abundance of previously annotated
miRNAs
For NB miRNA library construction, we used RNA derived
from 13 tumour samples as well as two neuroblastoma
cell lines, SH-EP (MYCN single-copy) and Kelly (MYCN
amplified). We followed the guidelines of Lau et al. ensuring that only those RNA species were cloned which contained 5'-phosphate [20]. The following cohort of
tumours was used for cloning: four MYCN amplified,
three stage 4S MYCN single-copy, two stage 4 MYCN single-copy and four stage 1 MYCN single-copy tumours
(Table 1).

sequences as well as novel miRNAs in small RNA libraries
[17,21]. Our cloning project covered 27% (128 miRNAs)
of miRNAs currently present in the public miRNA registry
(miRBase 9.1) [22]. 39 miRNAs were represented by only
one read. On the other hand, mir-124a (with three loci on
8p23.1, 8q12.3, 20q13.33) and -125b (11q24.1 and
21q21.1) yielded 113 and 132 reads, respectively (see
Additional File 1). MiRNA cloning was established as an
independent semi-quantitative method to evaluate
miRNA abundance [23]. This allowed us to conclude that
mir-124a and -125b were the most abundant ones. Both
miRNAs are considered as having neuronal specificity
[24,25]. Among the most frequently identified miRNAs
was mir-21 (17q23.2), a transcript with putative antiapoptotic and tumour promoting activities [8]. A difference in the abundance of certain miRNAs was observed in
MYCN-amplified and non-amplified specimens. In
MYCN-amplified tumours/cell line, we observed a higher
abundance of miRNAs from the mir-17/92 cluster
(13q31.3) that is known to be up-regulated by c-Myc. The
average numbers for hsa-mir-17-5p and hsa-mir-20a
reads in MYCN-amplified and single-copy specimens
were 5 versus 0.8 and 3.6 versus 0.6, respectively. A group
of miRNA sequences that clustered on chromosome 19
was exclusively found in the library of the MYCN amplified tumour, MYCNAMP_NB2. This argues for a cistronic
manner of transcription of this group of miRNA
sequences. Beside annotated human miRNAs we have
cloned 5 sequences that have been originally identified in
rat and mouse (see Additional File 1).

Approximately 80 clones per specimen or cell line were
sequenced. After linker unmasking, 3185 small RNA
cDNA sequences were subjected to further analyses. The
percentage of "not-known-miRNA" sequences varied
from 18% to 60% which corresponds to previously
described fractions of other non-coding RNAs, redundant

Identification and validation of new miRNAs
After removing redundant sequences and the sequences
derived from other non-coding RNAs, the remaining pool
was checked in silico for the detection of the putative
miRNA precursors using miRPredict (see Methods). This
analysis yielded 25 distinct sequences (39 reads) which

However, the full repertoire of miRNAs expressed in different cancer types, including neuroblastoma, is not yet
available. Prognosis-relevant miRNAs with putative oncogenic functions could have been missed in previous cloning efforts due to their silent state or low-expression.
There is evidence to date that neural lineage cells are particularly rich in miRNA diversity [17-19]. In this study, we
aimed at cloning novel miRNAs from NB cell lines and NB
specimens that may have a role in NB biology. Here, we
present the analysis of small RNA libraries derived from
neuroblastoma tumour specimens and cell lines and suggest several novel miRNAs. Some of these miRNAs reside
within loci of cancer-associated rearrangements and are of
special interest for future studies.

were classified as miRNAs. Of these 25 miRNAs, 10
sequences were miRNA* forms of previously annotated
miRNA precursors (Table 2). Hsa-mir-594 was cloned by
the Velculescu group, but then excluded from miRBase
due to overlap with a tRNA gene [26]. Cloning of the 594*
species described here provides evidence for the miRNA
nature of these sequences.

latter subgroup has features divergent from a canonical
miRNA hairpin, such as bulges (KELLY_276,
MYCNSC_NB2_148), short stem (MYCNSC_NB5_41) or
"oscillating" hairpin (MYCNAMP_NB4_70), where the
candidate miRNA can reside on the 5' or 3'-arm. Lui et al.
reported the cloning of a subset of non-canonical miRNAs, however the relevance of such RNAs to the classical
miRNA pathway remains to be determined [27].

Other 15 sequences represent novel small RNAs which
have not been annotated. Two novel sequences were
found adjacent to chromosomal localisations of known
miRNAs: MYCNSC_NB5_330 within a miRNA cluster on
chromosome 14 as well as MYCNAMP_NB2_61 within a
miRNA cluster on chromosome 19 (Table 3). Phylogenetic conservation was determined for each putative
miRNA and its surrounding with respect to chimpanzee,
macaque, opossum, mouse, rat, dog, bull and chicken
genomes (see Additional File 2). We found that the cloned
sequences with the exception of MYCNAMP_NB4_70 are
conserved either within all chosen species or primates.
The non-conserved MYCNAMP_NB4_70 sequence seems
to be the result of a short duplication within an intron of
the DPP10 transcript (Fig. 1). However, homologous
regions in chimpanzee and macaque genomes are also
able to form hairpins which might give rise to miRNAs.
Novel miRNAs do not share any homology with each
other and therefore do not comprise a family. Searching
against miRBase revealed that none of the new miRNAs
are related to the annotated miRNAs in miRBase, except of
one sequence, MYCNAMP_NB2_5, that is homologous to
hsa-mir-151 and -28. Analysis of genomic locations of the
individual miRNAs showed that 5 of them are localized in
extragenic regions. 8 sequences are found within introns
of coding transcripts. MYCNSC_NB5_64, classified as a
miRNA by miRpredict, is found within a predicted U5
gene which reduces reliability of this sequence as a
miRNA (Table 3). The likely precursors of the novel miRNAs (Fig. 2) may be subdivided into two subgroups: structures with typical hairpin or borderline precursors. The

Based on the data listed above, we subjected 24 new miRNAs to Northern blot validation using biotinylated
probes. Borderline case MYCNSC_NB5_64 sequences
were not further examined. The expression of each putative miRNA was checked in a panel of human tissues,
including different tumour specimens, normal brain,
adrenal gland, spleen and skeletal muscle tissues. 5 of 10
cloned miRNA* sequences and 8 sequences from individual hairpins were Northern blot positive (Fig. 3). The
other 11 sequences remained undetectable (data not
shown). The probe for MYCNSC_NB5_41 yielded a signal
around 30 nt which is higher than the estimated sequence
size.
The
probes
for
CONTIG_CHR_9,
MYCNSC_NB5_237 and MYCNAMP_NB2_5 yielded several bands different in length by 1â3 nucleotides. Some
known miRNAs show such patterns in Northern blot
analyses and intermediate products of miRNA maturation
have been observed, but there is no comprehensive explanation for these results [19,28,29]. In normal tissues,
Northern blot-positive miRNAs are preferentially
expressed in brain, skeletal muscle tissue and adrenal
gland, being less frequently expressed in spleen. The
detection of miRNAs in skeletal muscle might be due to
the presence of motor neurons. Several miRNAs showed
differential expression in normal versus tumour specimens: CONTIG_CHR_9, KELLY_276, MYCNAMP_NB2_5
were expressed in tumours, but not in normal tissues. On
the other hand, we did not find MYCNAMP_NB2_61
miRNA in tumour specimens, but we found strong expression of this sequence in brain.

Conclusion
Recently, several studies have been performed aiming at
directional cloning of tissue/tumour specific miRNAs
[13,26,27]. The importance of such an approach is highlighted by the fact that patterns of novel miRNAs from
tumours of different lineages hardly overlap and may
include miRNAs with a functional role in tumourigenesis.
Our study provides evidence for 29 new human miRNAs
cloned from neuroblastoma. 5 of them were originally
cloned from other species and have not been annotated in
the human miRNA database. 10 sequences represent
miRNA* species of previously annotated sequences. 14
sequences, which have not been annotated before, are
suggested to be novel miRNAs. Some of these miRNAs are
found within regions of chromosomal rearrangements
associated with cancer. For example, new miRNAs on
9p21 residing within NB-related aberration region are of
special interest for future studies [30]. miRNA profiling of

these novel sequences will allow us to clarify their relevance in NB development, progression and regression.

Methods
Tumour specimens and cell culture
SH-EP and Kelly cells were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, glutamate and penicillin/streptomycin. NB tumour samples were collected
prior to any cytoreductive treatment and were frozen
immediately until RNA was isolated. Written informed
consent was obtained from patients' parents for tissue
sampling. Genomic MYCN status was assessed in the reference laboratories of the German NB trial in KÃ¶ln and
Heidelberg.
Small-RNA library construction and sequencing
Small-RNA fractions were directly isolated with the use of
the mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion). 18â26 nt
RNA library construction was performed as described by
Lau and coworkers [20]. Sequencing was performed by
GATC BIOTECH (Konstanz, Germany).
Sequence analysis and prediction of novel miRNAs
Quality and vector trimming of sequences were performed with Vector NTI software. After unmasking linker
sequences, inserts of â¥17 bp were analysed using miRPredict, a miRNA prediction pipeline [31]. miRPredict compares each potential miRNA to both known miRNAs and
to other non-coding RNAs (EnsEMBL RNA database,

Assembly 36) with a pattern-match algorithm using the
EMBOSS program fuzznuc [32]. Sequences corresponding
to other non-coding RNAs were discarded and the rest was
localised in the genome via Blast search. The genomic hit
together with additional 50 bases to both sides were
extracted as potential precursor miRNA. In case that more
than one localization in a contig was found, as indicated
by equal score and expectation values of the BLAST search,
all localizations were used for further processing. In the
precursor DNA, palindromic structures are recognized by
the program PALINDROME (EMBOSS package, allowing
4 mismatches in the stem, loop max. 40 bases, length
between 15 and 50). If a palindrome was found, the palindromic region was folded with RNAFOLD (Vienna
package) to get the energy value and the input file for the
triplet SVM classifier [33,34]. The triplet SVM determines
the fold as miRNA-like palindrome (value +1), other palindrome (value -1) or regions with more than one loop
(empty output).
To assess hairpin conservation, we extracted alignments of
putative miRNA precursors from chimpanzee, macaque,
mouse, rat, dog, cow, opossum and chicken genomes via
EnsEMBL. Extracted sequences were checked for hairpin
structures with the use of RNAfold, and aligned by RNAforester [35].

Northern blotting
Total RNA was isolated with TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen).
30 micrograms of total RNA was loaded per lane and separated on 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gels, transferred by electroblotting to GeneScreen+ membranes
(Perkin Elmer). To check for non-radioactive probe specificity, 250 pg of synthetic 5'-phosphorylated sequence
identical to the respective miRNA was loaded along with
5'-phosphorylated marker sequences (20 + 30 nt, 250 pg
each, see Additional Files 3 and 4). Blots were hybridized
overnight at 37Â°C with radioactively Î±-(32P) labeled DNA
oligo probes complementary to the cloned sequences in
Church buffer, washed twice with 2 Ã SSC, 0.1% SDS at
37Â°C, and exposed to films (Fuji Film). For non-radioactive detection, blots were incubated with 3'-biotinylated
probes (10 ng/ml) and then processed with North2 South
Chemiluminescent Hybridization and Detection Kit
(Pierce). Prolonged washing was applied after incubation
with HRP-streptavidine conjugate.
