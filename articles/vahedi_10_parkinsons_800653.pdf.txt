Abstract
Background: Parkinson’s disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. The pathological
hallmark of the disease is degeneration of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Genetic association studies have linked
13 human chromosomal loci to Parkinson’s disease. Identification of gene(s), as part of the etiology of Parkinson’s
disease, within the large number of genes residing in these loci can be achieved through several approaches,
including screening methods, and considering appropriate criteria. Since several of the indentified Parkinson’s
disease genes are expressed in substantia nigra pars compact of the midbrain, expression within the neurons of
this area could be a suitable criterion to limit the number of candidates and identify PD genes.
Methods: In this work we have used the combination of findings from six rodent transcriptome analysis studies on
the gene expression profile of midbrain dopaminergic neurons and the PARK loci in OMIM (Online Mendelian
Inheritance in Man) database, to identify new candidate genes for Parkinson’s disease.
Results: Merging the two datasets, we identified 20 genes within PARK loci, 7 of which are located in an orphan
Parkinson’s disease locus and one, which had been identified as a disease gene. In addition to identifying a set of
candidates for further genetic association studies, these results show that the criteria of expression in midbrain
dopaminergic neurons may be used to narrow down the number of genes in PARK loci for such studies.

Background
Selective degeneration of mesencephalic dopaminergic
(mesDA) neurons of substantia nigra pars compacta
(SNpc) is the pathological hallmark of Parkinson’s disease (PD; OMIM #168600). Although the molecular
mechanism behind demise of these neurons during the
course of PD is still unknown, numerous studies have
shown contribution of both genetic and environmental
and factors, such as neurotoxins, to degeneration of this
inherently vulnerable neuronal population [1], with less
than 15% of all PD cases account for familial subtype.
Based on DNA linkage studies, 13 distinct human
chromosomal locations, PARK loci, have been linked to
the disease: PARK1 [2], PARK2 [3], PARK3 [4], PARK4
[5], PARK5 [6], PARK6 [7], PARK7 [8], PARK8 [9],
PARK9 [10], PARK10 [11], PARK11 [12], PARK12[12],
PARK13 [13]. These loci expand variably, from 7 to

40 Mb, on different chromosomes each of which contains several hundreds of genes. There are 4 orphan PD
loci with no associated genes so far and mutation/s in 8
genes, located in 9 out of 13 PARK loci have been
linked to PD. Mutations in a-synuclein located on
PARK1 and PARK 4, Parkin, Ubiquitin carboxy-terminal-hydrolase-L1(UCHL1), PTEN-induced-putative
kinase (PINK1), DJ1, Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2
(LRRK2), ATPase type 13A2 (ATP13A2), HTRA2 genes
in PARK2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 13 have been shown, respectively, to cause PD [14]. Additionally, two other susceptibility genes, Nurr1 (NR4A2) and tau, which show no
linkage to previously described PARK Loci, have been
linked to families with Parkinson’s disease [15]. Each of
the PARK loci contains a large number of genes and
identification of disease genes requires proper criteria to
narrow down the number of candidates. Since five out
of seven PD genes (a-SYNUCLEIN, PARKIN, UCHL1,
PINK1 and LRRK2) plus the two latter genes (NURR1
and TAU) are expressed in midbrain dopaminergic

neurons, possibly linking the abnormality in their
expression or structure to selective degeneration of
SNpc neurons, expression of genes within this neuronal
population seems to be a suitable criterion for narrowing down the number of genes to be further analyzed
for identification of PD genes to be associated with
orphan PD loci.
To date, six genome-wide screens have been performed to identify gene expression pattern of rodent
dopaminergic neurons [16-21]. In a recent study, using
the in situ hybridization database, Allen Brain Atlas
(ABA) [22], and the results of the transcriptome analyses, we verified the expression of 362 genes within the
dopaminergic neurons of the midbrain [23]. In this
study, using the criteria of specific expression, and the
strategy described by Gherbassi et al. [15], we merged
the rodent gene expression data from three of the six
screens, with human linkage studies to narrow down the
number of candidates for disease susceptibility genes.

Results
Majority of the genes associated with familial Parkinson’s disease are expressed within mesDA neurons, the
population of neurons which is lost during the course of
the disease. We, therefore, used the criterion of expression to prioritize the identification of genes, which may
be the risk factors or responsible for the onset or progression of the disease. Recently, we identified the
expression pattern of the genes within two major nuclei
of the midbrain, substantia nigra pars compacta and
ventral tegmental area, detectable by in situ hybridization. This was done by verifying the expression pattern
of genes from six published libraries [16-21] in the
Allen Brain Atlas in situ hybridization database [22] and
comparing them to the expression pattern of tyrosine
hydroxylase within the midbrain. This search confirmed
the expression of 362 genes out of the published
libraries within mesDA neurons [23]. The results were
confirmed and updated as of May 2010.

Methods

Cytogenetic locations and linkage to human genome

Transcript collection and processing

A recent study by Gherbassi et al. considered the genes
in three of the six screens (Thuret et al., Stewart et al.,
and Barrett et al.), which were performed to identify the
expression profile of mesDA neurons. In order to avoid
redundancies, we excluded the genes, which were identified by more than one screen and only considered the
genes identified by Greene et al., Grimm et al., and
Chung et al. After confirming the expression of each
gene within the mouse ventral midbrain and determining the homologous human gene name, symbol and
accession number (Additional file 1: Table S1), we used
the Map Viewer search tool http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/mapview/ on the NCBI web site to determine the
cytogenetic locations of 199 genes. Then, the positions
were compared with the positions of the PARK loci by
aligning the human chromosome map view with the
OMIM morbid map in http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
entrez/query.fcgi?db=OMIM, using the OMIM identifiers 163890, 602544, 602404, 605543, 191342, 605909,
602533, 607060, 606693, 606852, 607688, 300557 and
610297 for PARK1-13. Of 199 genes, the cytogenetic
locations of 20 overlapped with that of PARK loci,
which were labeled PD candidate genes. One of these
genes, UCHL1, is a known PD gene, and 7 were within
Park12, which is an orphan PD locus (Table 1).

The transcripts of the mouse and rat genes were
obtained from six published libraries [16-21]. After elimination of redundancies and duplications, above background mRNA expression within ventral midbrain, with
expression patterns, resembling that of tyrosine hydroxylase in VTA or SNpc, was verified in ABA [22], as
previously described [23]. We employed each nucleotide
sequence for a nucleotide-nucleotide BLAST (blastn)
(basic local alignment search tool) on the non-redundant database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/ and
on the mouse genome http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/seq/BlastGen/BlastGen.cgi?taxid=10090. Using the
criteria of highest homology and lowest e-value, for this
study, we employed only the unambiguous hits (transcripts), with homology on mouse genome.
Mapping gene locations into the PARK loci

The human analogs for the mouse genes were found,
using the Gene, Protein or the BLAST search functions of
the NCBI database. After determining the Genbank accession number of the genes, the cytogenetic location on the
human genome was determined using the Map Viewer
search tool http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mapview/. The
neighboring genes on the mouse and human genome were
considered to verify the identity and the position of the
gene in the human genome. The cytogenetic positions on
the human genome were compared with previously
described PARK loci http://www.pdgene.org. We aligned
the human chromosome map view with the OMIM morbid/disease map http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/
query.fcgi?db=OMIM to identify the PD gene candidates.

Discussion
Identifying multi-factorial disease-related genes requires
methods based on priori knowledge about the candidates. To prioritize the genes, several context-based
approaches, ranging from phylogenetic profiling to biochemical data integration have been used. Any given

method has its advantages and limitations and the ultimate test for validity of each method is functional relevance of the identified candidates to initiation or
progression of the disease. In Parkinson’s disease the
functional validation has been strongly linked to the
neuronal population that is afflicted during the course
of the disease, the dopaminergic neurons of substantia
nigra pars compacta in the midbrain.
Despite being the most prominent pathological feature
of PD, the reasons underlying specific degeneration of
these neurons are not fully understood. However, identification of disease genes has been crucial in understanding multiple cellular and molecular mechanisms,
contributing to this process. The expression of several
of the familial PD genes within nesDA neurons seems
to be required for physiological functions and survival of
this neuronal population. A number of studies have
established the role of multiple PD genes, including
PARKIN, PINK1 and DJ1 in degradation of unfolded
proteins [24]. Several other studies also have established
their neuroprotective role within mesDA neurons
against mitochondrial dysfunction in the animal models

of the disease [25]. PD genes also play vital functions
within the dopaminergic synapses [26].
Given these data, it is highly likely that familial Parkinson’s disease, caused by the loss of function mutations in the PD genes, is due to hindrance to functions
of the wild-type forms and that the proper expression of
the genes within mesDA neurons is essential to their
long-term survival. Considering this hypothesis, genomic
convergence, which combines gene expression with
genomic linkage analysis, has been used to prioritize
candidate susceptibility genes for PD [15,27]. In this
study, we used this approach to find candidates, among
the genes that are expressed in mesDA neurons, shown
by six rodent studies and verified by using the Allen
Brain Atlas in situ hybridization database. A previous
study, by Gherbassi et al. had merged the data from
three of the six screens to Parkinson’s disease linkage
studies. Here we found that 20, in addition to 21 human
genes, identified by Gherbassi et al., are located in multiple PARK loci (Table 1). The presence of UCHL1, a
known PD gene, among the results of this study validates the genomic convergence approach as an efficient

tool for prioritization and identification of candidate PD
genes. Using the same approach, three other known PD
genes (so far, 10% or 4 out of 41 genes, found by two
studies, are known PD genes) were identified previously
[15]. Additional genetic and disease model studies are
needed to determine whether any of the seven genes,
which are within PARK12 can be considered a disease
gene and their degree of functional relevance to survival
and maintenance of mesDA neurons.
