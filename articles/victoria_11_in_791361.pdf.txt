In silico comparative analysis of SSR
markers in plants
Filipe C Victoria1,2, Luciano C da Maia1, Antonio Costa de Oliveira1*

Abstract
Background: The adverse environmental conditions impose extreme limitation to growth and plant development,
restricting the genetic potential and reflecting on plant yield losses. The progress obtained by classic plant
breeding methods aiming at increasing abiotic stress tolerances have not been enough to cope with increasing
food demands. New target genes need to be identified to reach this goal, which requires extensive studies of the
related biological mechanisms. Comparative analyses in ancestral plant groups can help to elucidate yet unclear
biological processes.
Results: In this study, we surveyed the occurrence patterns of expressed sequence tag-derived microsatellite
markers for model plants. A total of 13,133 SSR markers were discovered using the SSRLocator software in nonredundant EST databases made for all eleven species chosen for this study. The dimer motifs are more frequent in
lower plant species, such as green algae and mosses, and the trimer motifs are more frequent for the majority of
higher plant groups, such as monocots and dicots. With this in silico study we confirm several microsatellite plant
survey results made with available bioinformatics tools.
Conclusions: The comparative studies of EST-SSR markers among all plant lineages is well suited for plant
evolution studies as well as for future studies of transferability of molecular markers.

Background
In agriculture, productivity is affected by environmental
conditions such as drought, salinity, high radiation and
extreme temperatures faced by plants during their life
cycle, that impose severe limitations to the growth and
propagation, restricting their genetic potential and, ultimately, reflecting yield losses of agricultural crops.
Although, advances have been achieved through classical
breeding, further progress is needed to increase abiotic
stress tolerance in cultivated plants. New gene targets
need to be identified in order to reach these goals,
requiring extensive studies concerning the biological
processes related to abiotic stresses. Comparative analysis between primitive and related groups of cultivated
species may shed some light on the understanding of
these processes.
Microsatellites or SSRs (Simple Sequence Repeats) are
sequences in which one or few bases are tandemly

repeated, ranging from 1-6 base pair (bp) long units.
They are ubiquitous in prokaryotes and eukaryotes,
present even in the smallest bacterial genomes [1-3].
Variations in SSR regions originate mostly from errors
during the replication process, frequently DNA
Polymerase slippage. These errors generate base pair
insertions or deletions, resulting, respectively, in larger
or smaller regions [4]. SSR assessments in the human
genome have shown that many diseases are caused by
mutation in these sequences [5]. The genomic abundance of microsatellites, and their ability to associate
with many phenotypes, make this class of molecular
markers a powerful tool for diverse application in plant
genetics. The identification of microsatellite markers
derived from EST (or cDNAs), and described as functional markers, represents an even more useful possibility for these markers when compared to those based on
assessing anonymous regions [6-8]. EST-SSRs offer
some advantages over other genomic DNA-based markers, such as detecting the variation in the expressed
portion of the genome, giving a ‘’perfect’’marker-trait
association; they can be developed from EST databases

at no cost and unlike genomic SSRs, they may be used
across a number of related species [9].
Many studies indicate UTRs as being more abundant
in microsatellites than CDS regions [10]. In a study of
micro- and minisatellite distribution in UTR and CDS
regions using the Unigene database for several higher
plants groups, higher occurrence of these elements in
coding regions were found for all the studied species
[11]. Disagreements between earlier reports and the
later, reflect a deficiency in annotation when translated
and non-translated fractions are separated in the
Unigene transcript database. Dimer repeats were also
frequent in CDS regions, which could be due to the fact
that the Unigene database contains predominantly EST
clusters. Therefore, there is a tendency for underrepresenting the UTR regions in the annotated
sequences [11].
The characterization of tandem repeats and their
variation within and between different plant families,
could facilitate their use as genetic markers and consequently allow plant-breeding strategies that focus on the
transfer of markers from model to orphan species to be
applied. EST-SSR also have a higher probability of being
in linkage disequilibrium with genes/QTLs controlling
economic traits, making them more useful in studies
involving marker-trait association, QTL mapping and
genetic diversity analysis [9].
On model organisms, microsatellites have been
reported to correspond to 0.85% of Arabidopsis thaliana
(L.) Heynh, 0.37% of maize (Zea mays L.), 3.21% of tiger
puffer (Takifugu rubripes Temminck & Schlegel), 0.21%
of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans Maupas and
0.30% of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Meyer ex.
E.C. Hansen) genomes [10]. Moreover, they constitute
3.00% of the human genome [12]. All kinds of repeated
element motifs, excluding trimers and hexamers, are significantly less frequent in the coding sequences when
compared to intergenic DNA streches of A. thaliana,
Z. mays, Oryza sativa subsp japonica S. Kato (rice),
Glycine max (L.) Merr. (soybean) and Triticum aestivum
L. (wheat) [10].
Close to 48.67% of repeat elements found in many
species are formed by dimer motifs. In Picea abies
(L.) H. Karst. (Norway spruce), for example, the dimer
occurrence is 20 times more frequent in clones originating from intergenic regions vs. transcript regions [13].
Approximately 14% of protein translated sequences
(CDS - coding sequences) contain repetitive DNA
regions, and this phenomenon is 3 folds more frequent
in eukaryotes than prokaryotes [14]. Clustering studies
showing microsatellite occurrence in distinct protein
families (non-homologous) from either prokaryotic or
eukaryotic genomes, indicate that the origins of these
loci occurred after eukaryotic evolution [14-16]. The

highest and lowest repeat counts were found in rodents
and C. elegans, respectively [3].
In plant species, some reports have described the
levels of occurrence of microsatellites associated to
transcribed regions [7,8,10,11,17-22]. However, some
comparative and/or descriptive approaches, still can
offer new perspectives on the features of these markers.
Furthermore, frequently new groups of plant species
have their genome sequenced, enabling the reassessment
of databases using new sequences, representing divergent evolutionary groups and/or with different genetic
models.
The online platforms for nucleotide, protein and transcript (ESTs) databases available for the majority of species are relatively small when compared with model
species, eg Physcomitrella patens (Hedw.) Bruch &
Schimp., O. sativa and A. thaliana. Since the protocols
for the isolation of repetitive element loci, such as
microsatellites, require intensive labour and can be
expensive, the exploitation of these elements in silico on
databases of model plants and their respective transfer
to orphan species, is a potentially fruitful strategy.
In this study we present our results on the SSR survey
for the development of plant SSR markers. The survey
was based on clustered non-redundant EST data, their
classification, characterization and comparative analysis
in eleven phylogenetically distant plant species including
two green algae, a hepatic, two mosses, two fern, two
gymnosperms, a monocot and a dicot.

Results and Discussion
We analysed 560,360 virtual transcripts with the
SSRLocator software (Table 1). The species with most
abundant records in Genbank was Arabidopsis thaliana
with 224,496 virtual transcripts (40%), followed by
Oryza sativa with 121,635 (21.7%), Physcomitrela patens
with 79,537 (14.19%), Pinus taeda with 58,522 (10.44%)
and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii with 40,525 (7.2%).
The remaining species added up to 11.7% of virtual
transcripts analysed. When total genome sizes are compared for the model plants included in this analysis, the
virtual transcripts of P. patens (511 Mb) represent 0.01%
of genome size. For O. sativa (389 Mb) and A. thaliana
(109.2 Mb) the ESTs analysed represent 0.02% and
0.18%, respectively, of the genome. The highest average
bp count per EST sequence was found for Selaginella
spp. (924 bp) followed by M. polymorpha (777 bp),
C. reinhardtii (775 bp) and P. taeda (760 bp). The lower
average bp per sequence was found for G. gnemon (563
bp) and A. capillus-veneris (580 bp). For the model
plants, A. thaliana showed the lowest average bp count
(321 bp), with P. patens and O. sativa presenting similar
bp counts (737 and 755 bp, respectively). Shorter
observed sequences could be an indication of

incomplete representation of genes, but one must keep
in mind that average gene sizes could vary among species, i.e., rice fl-cDNAs (1,747 bp) are 14% longer than
Arabidopsis fl-cDNAs (1,532 bp) (TAIR 9 and RIKEN,
accessed in 12.2.2010). The overall bp counts are very
similar to those found by other authors [23].
The frequency of SSR per EST database was higher
(4.66%) in Selaginella spp virtual transcripts (Table 2).
For model plants, 3.57% and 0.84% SSRs/EST were
found for O. sativa and A. thaliana, respectively.
The average motif length, excluding compound SSRs,
was 27.03 bp. Mesostigma EST database shows the
longest SSR average size with 34.13 bp, and the shortest size was found for Marchantia polymorpha with
22.56 bp mean size. The SSR size for model plants was
similar. For P. patens, O. sativa and A. thaliana, average sizes of 24.2, 23.4 and 26.5 bp were found, respectively. A total 1,106 EST sequences contained more
than one SSR. Among the species, O. sativa and
P. patens are on the extremes of the distribution with

37.34% and 3.46% of virtual transcripts containing one
or more microsatellites. However, Adiantum capillusveneris EST database contained the highest percentage
of transcripts displaying more than one SSR (20.86%)
based on the database size. Similar results were found
in our group [11], using the Unigene database for
grasses and other allies. In the same study, rice was
shown to have the highest frequency of ESTs containing more than one SSR (11.28%). In the present study,
a similar value was found for rice (10.20%). These
small differences could be due to different redundancy
reduction parameters used in Unigene species database
and CAP3 default settings. Other reports for higher
plants [19,20,24-26], showed different ranges, but
never higher than 2-3 fold. The variations encountered
in different reports are related to the strategy
employed by investigators (software, repeat number
and motif type) [11]. The results for each species,
regarding the percentage of SSRs found per EST database size are shown on Table 2.

The microsatellite survey using SSRLocator showed
that 13,133 SSRs were available as potential marker loci.
From those, 12,585 loci were found in single formation
and only 590 were found in compound formation. The
fern A. capillus-veneris showed the highest percentage
(20%) of compound SSR loci. When compared with
other available SSR marker search tools, similar results
were found. Using MISA software, a total of 13,861
SSRs were available as potential marker loci, being
13,172 SSRs single and 689 compound SSRs for all studied species. Adiantum EST database showed the highest percentage of SSR in compound formation (15.55%).
This trend does not hold for the majority of lower
plants. P. patens, for example, presented few EST-SSRs
in compound formation (3.57%) and possibly the fern
lower database size is masking the results. When it is
compared with the majority of plant groups, P. taeda is
the only species showing a high percentage of compound SSRs (5.81%), corroborating other studies which
report that compound and imperfect tandem repeats are
most common in pines [27-29].
A total of 3,723 EST-SSRs were found in P. patens
database using the MISA software [23]. The SSRLocator
analysis resulted in 2,839 SSR for this species. When the
same non-redundant databases were run in other bioformatics tools, the results were similar to MISA. Using the
SciKoco package [30] combined with MISA, Sputinik
and Modified scripts, it was possible to narrow SSR
results to a 2-fold range variation.
The search for repetitive elements in EST databases of
the eleven taxa listed above enabled the comparison of
patterns of occurrence of these elements in lower
and higher plants (Figure 1). In some species such as
C. reinhardtii, Mesostigma viride and bryophytes,
we found that dimer (NN) microsatellites are more

Page 4 of 15

common when compared to higher plants (Figure 2).
The trimer (NNN) microsatellites are predominant in
higher plants (See additional files), in agreement with
other SSR survey studies [6,10,11,21] supporting the
relative distribution of motifs in these plant groups.
However, gymnosperm species showed the lowest SSR
occurrence within the derived plant groups. Pinus and
Gnetum results indicate low SSR frequencies as intrinsic
characteristics of gymnosperms, such as suggested by
other results obtained with distinct methods
[10,23,28,29]. The patterns of occurrence of dimers and
trimers found in the EST databases of the selected species are shown on Additional files 1 and 2, respectively.
The average GC-content in the 11 datasets was
48.55%. Significantly increased GC-contents were
detected for the green algae Chlamydomonas (57.22%)
and Mesostigma (51.36%), for the moss Syntrichia
ruralis (54.75%) and the fern moss Sellaginella spp.
(51.38%). These results are in agreement with other
genomic comparative analyses of a wide range of plant
groups, where the lower groups presented the higher
contents [23,31,32]. The remaining species showed similar results (Table 1).
Dimer and Trimer most frequent motifs

For algae species, the most frequent dimer motifs were
AC/GT and CA/TG (Figure 2). For example, in C. reinhardtii, from 548 dimer occurrences, 199 AC/GT and
233 CA/TG motifs were found. The predominant trimer
motifs found were GCA/TGC, CAG/CTG and GCC/
GGC (Additional file 3) with 55, 46 and 39 occurrences
in 263 trimers found for algae species. For nonvascular
plants, the predominant dimer motifs were AG/CT
(239/1,049), AT/AT (226/1,049) and GA/TC (340/
1,049), as found for P. patens. For mosses, the most

frequent trimers found within the studied species were
GCA/TGC, AAG/CTT and AGC/GCT. For vascular
plants, the most frequent motifs were AG/CT and GA/
TC. In O. sativa, 246 (43%) and 191(33%) occurrences
for these motifs were found, respectively, in a total of
578 dimer occurrences. The GC/GC was only detected
in C. reinhardtii. There has been a report on the abundance of GC elements in Chlamydomonas genome
libraries [33].
For the other species this motif has not been reported
in high frequencies [10,11,23,28,34].
Among trimer motifs, there was a predominance of
AAG/CTT, AGA/TCT, GGA/TCC and GAA/TTC in
higher plants. In lower plants, the motifs GCA/TGC and
CAG/CTG were predominant. The trimer motif CCG/
CGG is predominant in the algae C. reinhardtii and the
model moss P. patens, and could reflect the high GC
content in these two species. However, this relationship
does not hold for the other cryptogams analysed. The
increased CCG/CGG frequency has been described earlier for grasses and has been related to a high GC-content
[10]. In this context, the CCG/CGG increase in Chlamydomonas and P. patens was consistent, but, a previous
study reported that it can not be taken as a rule, since
higher GC values were found for other lower groups with
low CCG/CGG contents [23]. For rice CCG/CGG is the
predominant motif and its content appears to be high in
the members of the grass family [11,21].
Comparing all plant groups selected for this in silico
study, the most frequent dimer motifs found were AG/
CT and GA/TC, occurring for all plant species. The

most frequent trimers were AAG/CTT and GCA/TGC
occurring in the 11 studied species.
Tetramers, Pentamers and Hexamers

Tetramer and pentamer motifs were rare for all studied
species except for M. viride. This algae showed the
higher frequencies in loci formed by motifs longer than
three nucleotides with 36.95% of tetramer and 19.56% of
pentamer motifs. Although these results are in agreement with other study [23], it is difficult to state that
this is a rule for this species, since the EST database size
for Mesostigma is the smallest one available among the
studied databases. In general, tetramer and pentamer
motifs predominantly found for Oryza, Physcomitrella
and Selaginela where CATC/GATG, CTCC/GGAG,
GATC/GATC, TGCT/AGCA (Additional file 4) and
CTTCT/AGAAG, GGAGA/TCTCC, GGCAG/CTGCC,
TCTCG/CGAGA and TGCTG/CAGCA (Additional file
5) and these were the most frequent motifs, at least for
two out of three of these species.
Hexamer motifs were predominant in novel taxa such
as gymnosperms and flowering plants [3,21,35]. P. taeda
and G. gnemom showed the highest frequency (26.95%)
of these motifs, but none of the hexamer motifs found in
Gnetum and Pinus were found in common with other
plant EST databases. However, one can not state the
absence of hexamer motif patterns in plant groups, since
in Bryophytes there is a possibility of patterns occurring
within closely related groups. For P. patens and
M. polymorpha the AGCAGG/AGCAGG, AGCTGG/
CCAGGT, CAGCAA/TTGCTG and TGGTGC/GCA

CCA motifs occur in both species (Additional file 6).
Based on plastid molecular data, Marchantiophyta and
Bryophyta originated about 450 Mya [36] and its possible
that some repeats are conserved for recently formed
groups, but it would be necessary to include others species in further analyses to confirm this hypothesis. For
the other SSR types (7, 8, 9 and 10 repeats) frequencies
were very low (less than 2 occurrences per motif) and
were not further characterized.
Physcomitrella patens SSR loci versus Gene Ontology
assignments

For the 4,909 SSR loci found for P. patens EST
sequences, 1,750 had GO assignments. More than 25%
of these hits were exclusive to P. patens. However, up to
70% of SSR loci were found as conserved across the
moss and the higher plant species O. sativa, Vitis
vinifera L. and A. thaliana. On Table 3, the distribution
of the best Blast hits is presented.

Regarding biological processes, the majority of SSR
loci found were involved with metabolic (32.17%) and
cellular (31.02%) processes (Figure 3). Comparing all
P. patens genome sequences with Gene Ontology
assignment and those containing SSRs (Figure 4), there
was a concentration of SSRs in metabolic process genes.
Biological adhesion, rhythmic processes, growth and cell
killing processes had the lowest SSR contents among
the P. patens transcripts. Similar results were found
comparing P. patens and A. thaliana EST libraries [37].
This author suggested that genes that are involved in
protein metabolism and biosynthesis are well conserved
between mosses and vascular plants. These patterns
were confirmed for mosses using Syntrichia ruralis and
P. patens transcript databases, respectively [38,39]. For
cellular components (Figure 5) the majority of SSRs
found are related to intracellular component gene
sequences (52.52%) and membrane elements (12.15%).
This ontology levels were reported as the majority of
GO assignments in for P. patens annotated sequences
[39]. Currently, more than half of cellular component
GO annotations for P. patens genome [32] are related
with membrane structure (Figure 6). Our results show
the enrichment of SSR occurrence mainly for genes
related to this structural level. The whole genome molecular function assignment level in Gene Ontology
revealed a predominance of binding genes (80.51%), suggesting these are representatively higher in P. patens
genome (Figure 7). However, when EST sequences containing SSRs are assessed with the Gene Ontology
assigned molecular function (Figure 8), a relative
increase of other functions is revealed. Sequences associated with binding decrease (42.81%), and those related
to catalytic activity (33.76%), and structural molecule
activity (10.80%) increase. These findings agree to the
expectations concerning the cellular function and are
consistent with ratios observed for rice, Arabidopsis, and
for the bryophytes Syntrichia ruralis and P. patens
[32,38-41]. The higher occurrence of SSR loci in this
ontology level indicate a good potential for using these
molecular markers to saturate pathways associated to
those functions described above.
Predicted coding for SSR loci

The predicted amino acid content for the SSR loci
detected in the eleven species studied is shown in Figure
9. The amino acids arginine (Arg), alanine (Ala) and
Serine (Ser) were predominant for all species. Alanine
was predominant for the majority of cryptogams, ranging from 14.85% to 29.7%. Exceptions were observed
for Adiantum, Mesostigma and Physcomitrella, in which
serine (Ser), glutamic acid (Glu) and leucine (Leu) were
the predominant amino acid (up to 17%). Serine (up to
11%) was predominant for fern species and for Gnetum

the predominant amino acid (10.46% and 23.31%,
respectively). Tyrosine (Tyr), asparagine (Asp), aspartic
acid (Asn) were the amino acids found at lower frequencies among SSR loci for all species and were practically

absent in the algae species surveyed. In bryophytes,
methionine was only found in Physcomitrella, but at a
small frequency (1.7%). For all higher plant species databases used in this survey, arginine, alanine, serine, glutamic acid, proline (Pro) and leucine were among the

predominant amino acids, agreeing with previous
reports for flowering plants [11,3,22,42-45]. No reports
were found for amino acid distribution in SSR loci in
lower plants.
The small EST databases available for some species
did not seem to have hampered the results, since the
predicted loci distribution found were consistent within
the taxonomic groups. The absence of a relationship
between genome size and tandem repeat loci content
were reported based in grass genome studies [11], where
large genomes such as sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.), maize and wheat did not present higher frequencies of SSR loci.
Relationship of Codon-bias with EST-SSR motif occurrences

The high GC-content in some EST-SSR motifs found in
the present study can be a result of a codon usage preference by plant species. When we compare the codon
usage for the model species included in this study
(Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Physcomitrella patens,
Oryza sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana) the occurrence
of some repeat motifs are reflected in codon-bias known
for each species. Higher frequencies of GC were found
in the first and third codon position for all four species.
However, for the basal plant (C. reinhardtii), the preference for GC3 was much higher than the other three
species. The first (GC1) and the third (GC3) codon
position reached 64.8% and 86.21% of the occurrences,
respectively. For rice, GC1 and GC3 frequencies were
58.19% and 61.6%, respectively. For the other model

plants, the occurrences at GC3 were lower than the
occurrences in GC1, i.e., for Physcomitrella patens and
Arabidopsis thaliana, GC1 (55.49% and 50.84%, respectively) and GC3 (54.6% and 42.4%, respectively) values
were found. When one associates these codon usage
values with the SSR motif frequencies found, a striking
result is obtained for C. reinhardtii and rice. In the first,
the most frequent motifs were GCA/TGC, CAG/CTG
and GCC/GGC and could be explained by the GC1s
and GC3s codon preference. In rice the CCG/CGG predominant motif could also be a reflection of GC3s
codon preference. For Arabidopsis, the most frequent
motif found in this study (GAA/TTC) is also the most
preferred codon used by this species (GAA) with 34.3%
of the occurrences. It also reflects the GC1 preference
in the codon usage in this species. In the model moss
species the most frequent motifs do not show a relationship with the GC codon usage (Figure 10). Despite the
similarities in average codon bias between P. patens and
Arabidopsis thaliana, the distribution pattern is different, with 15% of moss genes being unbiased [46]. An
association between the frequency of microsatellite
motifs and codon usage could explain the occurrences
found in P. patens. For example, the most representative
motifs GCA/TGC, AAG/CTT and AGC/GCT are also
found among the most used codons GCA, AAG and
AGC (20.7%, 33.6% and 15%, respectively).
The width of the GC3 distribution in flowering plants
was found to be a result of variation in the levels of

directional mutation pressure or selection against mutational biases. Likewise, the low frequency of GC2 occurrences is a result of a strong selective pressure against
peptide substitution. The balance between these forces
could be shaping the distribution of EST-SSR by means
of codon usage preference [47].
Positive and negative selection sites in EST-SSR across
species

SSRs represent hyper mutable loci subject to reversible
changes in their length [8]. Significant differences in
SSR representations exist even among closely related
species, suggesting that SSR abundance may change
relatively rapidly during evolution [48]. To infer about
the selection pressures (dN/dS ratio) on EST-SSR found
for the 11 species chosen for this work, we used the
common most frequent motif in all species (AAG/CTT
and GCA/TGC). The dN-dS test revealed few negatively

selected sites in the triplets for each EST-SSR (Additional file 7). The positive selection in SSR based
sequence was reported in other studies [8,49-51]. More
than 50% of sites for both motifs analyzed across species
were under a positive selection (dN/dS > 1), suggesting
a weak selection pressure on these EST-SSR motifs, as
was reported for other species [52,53]. The occurrence
of selective sweeps or background selection in ancestral
lineages [54] cannot be discarded, however it could not
be tested with the present data.
In silico transferability of EST-SSR across species

Across-species transferability of EST-SSRs is greater
than genomic SSRs, as they originate from expressed
regions and therefore they are more conserved across a
number of related species [6].
The virtual PCR shows a lower transferability of
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii EST-SSR for most of the

Victoria et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:15
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/15

plant species tested. The best results were found for
Adiantum and Arabidopsis, where successful rates of
positive EST-SSR amplicons derived from algae were
26% and 9%, respectively. When EST-SSR primers
designed from Arabidopsis were used against other species, again low transferability rates were found, being
the best positive cases found in Physcomitrella, Pinus
and rice with amplification rates of 1.04%, 1.20% and
1.90%. The summary of in silico PCR results can be
accessed in the Additional files section of this article.
Some reports suggest that SSR markers have higher
transferability rates when used between closely related
species [6,22,55]. In this work virtual PCR amplification
did follow the same trend.
For the positive EST-SSRs found for the in silico
transfer, ten sets of Physcomitrella EST-SSR primers
were used to illustrate the transferability results using
an electronic tool [56] to simulate gel electrophoresis
(Figure 11). For the three tested EST-databases only two
primers amplified a single locus in each species (SSR9
and SSR10). In the other sets 2, 3 and even 4 virtual
amplicons were observed (Additional file 8). For Chlamydomonas, 70% of the tested primers resulted in one
amplicon and 10% each resulted in 2, 3 or 4 amplifications. However, only 20% of amplicons obtained in this
algae species are related to the EST-SSR sequence, suggesting that the majority of designed EST-SSR primers
act as degenerate when applied to Chlamydomonas. For

Page 12 of 15

rice, 30%, 40% and 10% of tested primers resulted in
one, two or three amplifications, respectively. In Arabidopsis 40%, 40% and 20% of tested primers results in
one, two or three amplifications, respectively. For both
flowering plants, 50% of tested primers amplified moss
EST-SSR homologue sequences, showing a high rate of
success for transferability across species. These results
agree with other studies where the transfer success rates
decrease with the increasing evolutionary distance
[55,57-60]. The use of this molecular marker across distant taxonomical groups are not impossible, however
our findings confirm that only a few retain their ESTSSR homologue sequences, making this effort hardly
worthwhile [61].

Conclusions
These results make it possible to create strategies for
transferring molecular markers based on microsatellites
from model to orphan species.
Microsatellites were found in all species studied and
variable transfer rates were found as a function of
genetic distance among taxa. The motifs found are influenced by species codon usage preference. The two most
common motifs among the eleven species are under a
positive selection pressure. Primers generating one
amplicon in the genome of origin may generate multiple
amplicons in other taxa and only a few retain their original targeting sequence. The similarities between the

results here presented and other initiatives using similar
bioinformatics Perl scripts, such as MISA [23], support
SSRLocator as a useful tool for SSR survey analyses.

Methods
An exploratory in silico analysis of SSRs was made in ESTs
databases of 11 taxa, as follows: two unicellular green algae
(Chlamydomonas reinhardtii Dang, Mesostigma viride
Lauterborn.), three bryophytes s. l. [Marchantia polymorpha L., Physcomitrella patens and Syntricha ruralis
(Hedw.) Weber & Mohr], two ferns (Selaginella spp. and
Adiantum capillus-veneris L.), two gymnosperms (Gnetum
gnemon L. and Pinus taeda L.) and two flowering plants, a
monocot (Oryza sativa) and a dicot (Arabidopsis thaliana). These species were chosen because the amount of
available ESTs data in Genbank (NCBI). As these databases may have redundancy, we used the program CAP3
[62] for MacOX, to construct contigs with the sequences
and get non-redundant sequences for each database
following the default settings.
Taxa data were loaded into the software SSRLocator
[63], to investigate the presence of tandem repetitive elements (SSRs). The analysis was performed following
the search parameters for repetitive elements in class I
(≥ 20 bp) described as more efficient molecular markers
[17]. Data resulting from in silico analyses were assessed
for occurrence patterns in chosen taxa databases. The
same analysis was performed using MISA script http://
pgrc.ipk-gatersleben.de/misa/ software to search for SSR
occurrences per contig. Several instructions in the algorithm used in SSRLocator resemble those from MISA [19]
and SSRIT [17]. However, additional instructions have
been inserted in SSRLocator’s code. Instead of allowing the
overlap of a few nucleotides when two SSRs are adjacent
to each other and one of them is shorter than the minimum size for a given class as found in MISA and SSRIT, a
module written in Delphi language records the data and
eliminates such overlaps. For GC content, Perl scripts
were used and the results were stored in text files (.txt) for
later comparative analyses.
For the predicted amino acid contents in the SSR loci,
an additional routine script was written in the SSRLocator software. This script determined which amino acids
were coded by trimer, hexamer and nonamer motifs
found in the EST database analysed [63].
To validate the frequencies obtained using the SSRLocator software, the Physcomitrella patens EST database
was chosen.
This database was run with other SSR search scripts
and softwares, such as MISA [19] and SPUTINIK [64],
running in SCIROKO package [30], MINE SSR http://
www.genome.clemson.edu/resources/online_tools/ssr,
SSRIT following the SSR categories defined above [17].
The results were exported into Microsoft Excel

Page 13 of 15

spreadsheets (MacOSX-Oficce 2008) and respectively
grouped by taxon.
A codon-bias for the model plants included in this
research (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Physcomitrella
patens, Oryza sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana) was
made comparing with the preferencial codon table for
each species available at http://www.kazusa.or.jp/
codon/. The sequences containing EST-SSR for Physcomitrella patens was submitted to CodonO server [65]
to confirm the preferencial codon usage compared
with the know codon table for this species. To investigate the selective pressure on the triplets on the
EST-SSR which occurs in all studied species a dN-dS
statistics [66] was used to verify the synonymous and
noun-synonymous substitutions in the preferential
codons nearby the repeats chosen using the molecular
phylogenetics package MEGA4 [67].
The Physcomitrella patens SSR results were run
through a Gene Ontology (GO) assignment database in
order to assess associations between SSR loci and biological processes, cellular components and molecular
function of known genes. A fasta file with all EST-SSRs
found in P. patens was subjected to Blast2GO software
and ran against the GO annotated sequences, and the
obtained hits were compiled.
To verify the potential transferability of this molecular
markers we have tested in silico all EST-SSR found for
the plant ancestral lineage, and for the derivative plant
group, represented here by the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Arabidopsis thaliana, across the
others species EST database used for the present SSR
survey. Electronic PCR [68] was used to verify the
transferability of EST-SSRs across studied species. The
positive results found were used to simulate a gel electrophoresis with aid of SIMGEL.exe included in the SPCR
package [56] using the Physcomitrella patens EST-SSR
sequences to design primers and Chlamydomonas, rice
and Arabidopsis as templates. The virtual amplicons
resulted for each primer set tested across species were
aligned to verify the homology between the amplicons.
