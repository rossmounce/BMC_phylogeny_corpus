Results: We performed an in silico analysis of possible targets of the PmrAB system. Using a motif
model of the PmrA binding site in DNA, genome-wide screening was carried out to detect PmrAB
target genes. To increase confidence in the predictions, all putative targets were subjected to a
cross-species comparison (phylogenetic footprinting) using a Gibbs sampling-based motif-detection
procedure. As well as the known targets, we detected additional targets with unknown functions.
Four of these were experimentally validated (yibD, aroQ, mig-13 and sseJ). Site-directed mutagenesis
of the PmrA-binding site (PmrA box) in yibD revealed specific sequence requirements.

The PmrAB two-component regulatory system is part of a
multicomponent feedback loop that acts as one of the key regulatory mechanisms of Salmonella typhimurium virulence
[1-3]. The PmrAB regulatory system is itself responsive to
Fe3+ and mild acid [4] and senses Mg2+ indirectly by communicating with the Mg2+-sensitive PhoPQ system [5-8] via

PmrD [1,9]. PmrD is hypothesized to transduce the signal
from the PhoPQ system to the PmrAB system via a posttranslational modification. The gene pmrD is transcriptionally
activated by the PhoPQ system but repressed by the PmrAB
system [1,9,10]. The PmrAB system is required for resistance
to the cationic antibiotic polymyxin B [11] and to Fe3+-mediated killing [4]. The Mg2+-dependent regulation of PmrAB

Background: The PmrAB (BasSR) two-component regulatory system is required for Salmonella
typhimurium virulence. PmrAB-controlled modifications of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) layer confer
resistance to cationic antibiotic polypeptides, which may allow bacteria to survive within
macrophages. The PmrAB system also confers resistance to Fe3+-mediated killing. New targets of
the system have recently been discovered that seem not to have a role in the well-described
functions of PmrAB, suggesting that the PmrAB-dependent regulon might contain additional,
unidentified targets.

was shown to be important for gene expression in an intracellular environment [12]. Fe3+-dependent PmrAB regulation,
on the other hand, has been hypothesized to be essential for
survival in extracellular environments [13]. A region in DNA
to which the PmrA protein binds has been identified by DNA
footprinting analysis [14,15].
In contrast to pmrD, other known target genes of PmrAB in S.
typhimurium are transcriptionally activated. One group of
targets is involved in LPS modification. PmrAB-induced
modifications include the addition of 4-amino-4-deoxy-Larabinose (Ara4N) and phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) to lipid
A [16]. Loci involved in the Ara4N modification of lipid A are
ugd [6] and the pmrHFIJKLM loci, both of which are responsible for Ara4N biosynthesis [2,16-18] and incorporation of
Ara4N into lipid A [19,20]. LPS modifications are hypothesized to allow bacterial survival within macrophages by lowering the affinity of the LPS for amphipathic cationic peptides
with antimicrobial activity that are produced as a consequence of the innate immune response.
A second class of targets are directly dependent on PmrAB,
but have as-yet-undefined functions. pmrC (co-transcribed
with pmrAB [21]) and pmrG (located upstream of the pmrHFIJKLM operon) are both transcriptionally activated by
PmrAB. Mutations in pmrG did not affect the resistance to
polymyxin B [2]. Tamayo et al. recently identified two additional targets of PmrAB - yibD and dgoA. However, none of
these was involved in resistance to polymyxin B or to high
concentrations of Fe3+ [22]. These genes might therefore represent a group of as-yet-unidentified functions regulated by
the PmrAB system [22]. Also, PmrAB-regulated genes
involved in resistance to Fe3+ and pEtN addition to LPS
remain to be identified [22]. Together with the recent indications of new PmrAB-dependent functions, this raises the possibility that not all PmrAB targets have yet been identified.
Therefore, in this study we used an in silico approach to predict targets of the PmrAB regulatory system. Several methodologies exist for genome-wide screening using a motif model
(or mathematical representation) of experimentally verified
regulatory sites [23-27]. These assign to each possible motif
position in the genome a score (the specifics of which depend
on the methodology) that indicates how well the subsequence
located at that position matches the motif model. Genomewide screenings of this type have proved successful in detecting additional targets of the regulator being investigated.
However, more reliable predictions for motifs in specific
pathways have been obtained by incorporating cross-species
comparisons (phylogenetic footprinting) [26,28-34]. Because
evolutionary forces tend to preferentially retain functional
DNA sequences, motifs that are conserved in the intergenic
regions of orthologs derived from several related species are
more likely to be biologically relevant [35,36].
In this study, we combine both approaches. Putative targets
identified by a genome-wide screening were, whenever

possible, analyzed by phylogenetic footprinting based on
Gibbs sampling [33,34,37]. Four interesting targets were validated by wet lab experiments and the PmrA box of a representative target was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis.

Results
Genome-wide screening using a PmrA motif model
Gibbs sampling was used to detect PmrA-binding motifs in
the intergenic regions of three experimentally verified PmrAB
targets (ugd, pmrC, pmrG). The logo of the statistically overrepresented motif detected is represented in Figure 1. This
motif corresponded to the PmrA-binding site experimentally
identified by Aguirre et al. [15] and partially overlapped the
PmrA-binding site delineated by Wosten et al. [14]. They
detected this site upstream of the transcription start of pmrC,
in the intergenic region between pmrG and pmrH, and
upstream of ugd (on the plus strand) [14,15]. We used the
obtained motif model in a genome-wide screening of the S.
typhimurium intergenic sequences [38]. Table 1 summarizes
the results of our screening, using a threshold as described in
Materials and methods. From experimentally verified examples, it appears that the PmrA motif can be biologically functional not only when present on the plus strand (as in the case
of pmrH), but also when located on the minus strand (for
example in pmrG) [14]. Therefore, both strands of the
genome sequence were screened.

Identification of close homologs
We can expect to detect conserved biologically active PmrA
motifs only in species that have a functional counterpart of
the S. typhimurium PmrAB system. Of all the completely
sequenced bacterial species, only the genomes of S. typhimurium, S. typhi, Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri and Yersinia pestis contain the amino-acid motif that determines the
specificity of the sensor protein PmrB (the amino acids suggested to be involved in binding Fe3+ [4]). Also, the protein
domains involved in the binding of PmrA to DNA were almost
perfectly conserved in the PmrA orthologs in the species
above (PF00486 domain, see supplementary information on

Putative PmrA motifs were detected in the intergenic regions
of genes encoding transcriptional regulators, outer-membrane and secreted proteins, proteins with functions involved
in flagella and fimbria synthesis, proteins with a function
related to the modification of cellular components, putative
transport proteins, proteins involved in amino-acid synthesis
and also in phage remnants. As mentioned above, if the puta-

Detailed analysis of the putative PmrAB targets

Our analysis revealed that PmrA motifs, present in the intergenic sequences of known PmrAB-dependent S. typhimurium genes, were also conserved in the intergenic sequences
of the orthologs of these genes in related species (Figure 2).
An overview of the alignments of these known targets is given
below.

refereed research

For each dataset we aimed at constructing a local multiple
alignment. We used Gibbs sampling to generate motifs that
can be used as alignment seeds. Alignments were
subsequently constructed based on the positions of these
motif seeds. Potential seeds were selected using a heuristic
described in the supplementary information on [39]. Such
multiple alignments summarize the motifs in the intergenic
sequences that are conserved between species. We used the
alignments to verify whether the putative PmrA motifs
retrieved by the genome-wide screening were conserved in
other species. Table 1 gives an overview of the results of the
genome-wide screening and the phylogenetic footprinting
approach (individual alignments are displayed in the supplementary information at [39]).

deposited research

Phylogenetic footprinting using Gibbs sampling

tive PmrAB-regulated genes contained close homologs in
other species, the intergenic sequences of these close
homologs were locally aligned to check whether putative
PmrA motifs were conserved in these other species as well.
For some of the datasets, however, no local alignment could
be identified (no motif detected). Closer inspection showed
that most of these datasets contained highly homologous paralogs of the original sequence. The intergenic sequences of
these paralogs showed an overall low degree of conservation
(for example, STM0057) with the original intergenic
sequence in S. typhimurium (data not shown). In some of the
datasets, a local alignment of the respective intergenic
regions could be detected, but the putative PmrA motif was
not present within the conserved parts of the alignment (for
example, leuO). For these putative PmrAB targets, phylogenetic footprinting could not strengthen the confidence in the
prediction of the PmrA motif. If such putative motifs are biologically active, their activity will be restricted to Salmonella
serovars or S. typhimurium.

our website [39]). Therefore, these γ-proteobacterial species
were used to perform phylogenetic footprinting analysis. For
each gene containing a potential hit of the PmrA motif in the
S. typhimurium genome sequence, close homologs were
selected as described in Materials and methods.

reviews

Name: name of the gene in the S. typhimurium genome (NC_003197). For genes that are divergently transcribed and have a shared intergenic region,
the gene for which the motif is detected on the plus strand is indicated first and the gene for which the motif is on the minus strand is indicated after
the slash. Description: annotation of the encoded proteins and genome location of the genes (derived from GenBank and Sanger annotation). Score:
normalized score assigned to the respective motifs by MotifLocator. Site: instance of the motif as detected in the respective intergenic sequence.
Distribution (COG): distribution of the protein as determined by our analysis. The distribution is indicated by a binary profile that indicates the
presence 1 versus absence 0 of the protein in species (serovars) of, respectively, Salmonella, E. coli, Shigella and Yersinia (for example, 1111 indicates
protein present in all four species; 1000: protein present in Salmonella species only). Distribution: distribution of the protein encoded by the
corresponding gene in nine bacterial genomes as determined by McClelland et al. [38]. Proteins having close homologs in at least one Salmonella strain
but not in E. coli or K. pneumoniae are indicated by 'some Salmonella only'. Genes that contain close homologs in all genomes are indicated by 'all nine
genomes'. Other combinations are indicated by 'other distributions'. ? indicates that the authors were not certain about the statement. Differences
between the distribution as determined by McClelland et al. and the one determined by our analysis is due to the difference in selection criteria used
to identify close homologs (see Materials and methods). Alignment: indicates whether the intergenic regions in the dataset could be locally aligned
(nd, no local alignment detected that contained the original sequence of S. typhimurium; m, local alignment detected. If the dataset only contained
homologs from Salmonella species, local alignments were considered noninformative (indicated by /)). Footprint: denotes whether the PmrA motif is
conserved in the close homologs. +, the retrieved putative PmrA motif is conserved; -, the intergenic sequences of the orthologs could be locally
aligned but the PmrA motif was not part of the conserved regions. Most promising PmrAB targets that contained a PmrA motif matching the PmrA
consensus (Figure 4) are in bold face. PmrA motifs that are experimentally validated in this study are indicated by an asterisk.

Other promising PmrAB targets
On the basis of the instances of the PmrA motif in experimentally verified PmrAB targets of Salmonella (verified previously or validated in this study), a PmrA consensus was built
(Figure 4). The motif consensus of PmrA was converted into
a regular expression (A/C)(C/T)T(A/T)A(T/G/A) N5NTT(A/
T)A(T/A/G). To construct this regular expression we only
considered the two conserved half-sites, because the PmrA
motif is believed to be a dyad [15]. We preferred the part

information

The pmrC fusion showed a clear induction by either Mg2+
deprivation or Fe3+ excess. The observed level of induction
was higher for the Fe3+-dependent signal than for the Mg2+dependent signal and the combination of both signals seemed
to act synergistically. For both signals, induction was abrogated in a pmrA::Tn10d background, indicating that induction by Mg2+ and Fe3+ is solely PmrAB dependent. For the
mig-13 fusion, similar observations were made, although
induction by low Mg2+ and the synergistic effect of both signals were less pronounced. mig-13 also exhibited a considerable background expression level both in a pmrA::Tn10d
mutant and in the uninduced state in a wild-type background.

We constructed a set of mutant PmrA box sequences by sitedirected mutagenesis of the PmrA box of yibD. AT → GC and
GC → AT substitutions were introduced in the first half-site of
the PmrA box (Figure 3a). We focused on the first half-site, as
in the experimentally verified target pmrC, the second halfsite overlaps with the -35 promoter site [14]. Expression was
compared in different mutagenized fusions and the nonmutated fusion in the wild type and in the pmrA::Tn10d strain in
all conditions mentioned above. For simplicity, only the
expression values for two inducing conditions are displayed
in Figure 3b. One is induction by the combined action of high
Fe3+ and low Mg2+ concentrations and the other is the
induction by raised Fe3+ levels in the presence of high Mg2+.
Observations under all other conditions allowed us to draw
similar conclusions. Substitutions in the third and fifth positions of the motif box completely abrogated PmrAB-dependent expression. Mutations of the first, second, fourth or sixth
position reduced PmrAB-dependent induction. Note that for
the mutation in the second position, expression was very low
but not completely abrogated. Results from this site-directed
mutagenesis experiment of one representative PmrAB target
allowed us to demonstrate unequivocally that the PmrA box
we identified was responsible for PmrAB-dependent transcriptional activation. It also allowed us to further delineate
the sequence requirements of the PmrA consensus.

deposited research

For each of these targets, green fluorescent protein (GFP)
reporter fusions were constructed and their expression was
determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis in wild-type S. typhimurium and a pmrA::Tn10d mutant.
Because the PmrAB system is sensitive to Mg2+ and Fe3+ concentration, we tested the effect of these signals on the expression of the fusions [22] (Table 2). All experiments were
performed at pH 5.8 and pH 7.7. All fusions tested exhibited
the same PmrAB-dependent expression behavior at both pH
levels. In all experiments, pmrC was used as a positive
control.

Site-directed mutagenesis of the PmrA box

reports

Our in silico predictions pointed towards putative targets of
the PmrAB regulatory system. Some of these have functions
that were previously not associated with the PmrAB system.
To prove the strength of our in silico approach, four potential
targets were selected for biological validation: yibD (novel at
the time of our analysis), aroQ (STM1269), mig-13 and sseJ.
aroQ and yibD were selected because a perfect repeat of the
previously described PmrA half-site (CTTAAT [15]) was
detected in their respective intergenic regions. mig-13 (Figure
2) was chosen because it has previously been reported as a
gene selectively induced in macrophages, but with further
unknown regulation [40]. sseJ (Figure 2) was further analyzed because although PmrAB-regulated genes have been
implicated in animal virulence [2], no direct link between
SPI-2 (Salmonella pathogenicity island 2) gene regulation
and PmrAB has been demonstrated yet.

aroQ was strongly induced by low Mg2+ and induction was
abrogated in a pmrA::Tn10d background. The influence of
Fe3+ was less pronounced. In the case of yibD, the opposite
was found: the yibD gene was barely induced by low Mg2+ but
Fe3+ excess resulted in a large induction. For the yibD fusion,
although Fe3+ excess, but not Mg2+ deprivation, seemed to be
a sufficient signal to trigger expression, both signals acted
synergistically. Also, induction of yibD was abrogated in a
pmrA::Tn10d background. Compared to the other fusions,
the observed expression levels of the sseJ fusion were rather
low in the test conditions. Because sseJ showed a higher overall expression level at pH 5.8, these data were considered
most representative (see Table 2). Results show an upregulation of sseJ expression in elevated Fe3+ concentrations that
was absent in the pmrA::Tn10d background. As observed for
mig-13, sseJ was expressed at a background level in the
mutant pmrA::Tn10d. Interestingly, even at low concentrations, Mg2+ seemed to counteract the Fe3+-dependent
induction.

sequence as determined by Aguirre et al. have been conserved
in S. typhimurium, S. typhi and E. coli [15]. The promoter of
ugd also has a hit of the PmrA motif on the minus strand. This
was, however, not confirmed by DNA footprint analysis [15]
and might represent a false positive. The PhoP motif on the
plus strand in ugd of Salmonella, although occurring as a
dyad, is not conserved in close orthologs and was recently
demonstrated to be non-functional [12]. The recognition site
for the RcsB protein [12] is also conserved in E. coli. Lastly,
yibD encodes a putative glycosyltransferase. The PmrA motif
is conserved in E. coli. yibD has recently been identified as a
PmrAB target by a genome-wide mutagenesis study. Its
actual function is still unknown [22].

between the conserved half-sites of the regular expression to
be represented as degenerate (that is, N5). Indeed, the
observed degree of conservation in the intermediate part of
the motif model (Figure 4b) is probably related to the
restricted sample size of the training set rather than being an
intrinsic property of the motif. Promising motifs (indicated in
bold in Table 1) are, therefore, motifs that match this regular
expression and thus contain nucleotides that occur in the conserved half-sites of one of the experimentally verified examples. Promising targets for which the putative PmrA motif
was also conserved in species other than Salmonella were
mig-13, yrbF, yjgD, ybdO, yejG, lasT and ybdN. Promising
targets only present in S. typhimurium and/or S. typhi were
STM1269 (aroQ), STM1273, sseJ and lpfA. Note that this listing is just based on an arbitrary selection criterion, that is, a
preliminary PmrA motif consensus that will be improved as
more PmrAB targets become experimentally validated. As
well as the targets mentioned above, Table 1 contains other
targets that are of interest because their annotation relates to
the PmrAB system (such as yncD).

Discussion

Putative PmrAB targets were detected by genome-wide
screening of S. typhimurium intergenic sequences using a
PmrA motif model. If possible, the confidence in the predicted motifs was strengthened by a cross-species comparison: we tested whether the PmrA motif was conserved in the
intergenic regions of close homologs in related species. To
this end, we developed a two-step procedure for phylogenetic
footprinting. In the first step, a motif-detection procedure

based on Gibbs sampling was performed to generate a list of
motifs. In the second step, these motifs were used as seeds to
generate local multiple alignments. Eventually, the biological
relevance of the obtained alignments was assessed.
We used the alignments rather than a listing of the high-scoring motifs obtained by Gibbs sampling for the following reasons. First, we observed, as also reported by McCue et al., a
high overall similarity in intergenic regions of the selected
species [34]. In general, the overall degree in conservation
between the intergenic sequences of close homologs is about
93.56% for the sequenced representatives of Escherichia and
Shigella species, 69.21% for Shigella and Salmonella and
53.31% for Salmonella and Yersinia. As a result of this property (high correlation in the data), not only the motif itself
turns out to be conserved, but also its local neighborhood.
Moreover, the degree of conservation between the aligned
sequences in a biologically relevant alignment will reflect, in
most cases, the phylogenetic relatedness of the species from
which the sequences are derived (see Figure 2 for examples).
By selecting the most promising alignment seeds (based on
the appropriate heuristics for the scores) and constructing a
local alignment with these seeds, we could also evaluate the
local neighborhood of the seed. If this one seemed to be conserved as well, we could be more confident in the obtained
alignment and in the motifs contained within the conserved
parts. Therefore, the use of local alignments allows a better
judgment on the reliability of the motifs.
Second, Gibbs sampling is a stochastic procedure. The algorithm has to be run repeatedly on the same dataset, each time

generating potentially different motifs. As a consequence, the
output of a motif-detection approach can be simultaneously
redundant and non-exhaustive: some statistically strong
motifs are detected repeatedly in different runs. On the other
hand, some motifs might never be detected. Indeed, because
Gibbs sampling was originally designed for unrelated
sequences and because of the high correlation in the data, the

sampling. Therefore, an alignment is a better summary of the
degree of conservation between the intergenic regions than a
listing of the highest-scoring motifs.
Moreover, regulatory systems such as PmrAB might have
acquired some very species-specific targets. For such highly
specialized regulatory systems, motifs are likely to be present
in the intergenic sequences of a selected subset of orthologs
only. Because such motifs occur in a restricted number of
sequences of the dataset, they will not necessarily correspond
to the highest-scoring motifs. Thus, they might be overlooked
when selecting on high-scoring motifs by, for instance, setting
a threshold on the score. Once a reliable local alignment of a
set of intergenic sequences is obtained, one can judge the
degree of confidence to put on the prediction of the motif of
interest not only by checking in which subset of species the
motif is conserved, but also by taking into consideration other
factors, such as the functional annotation of the putative target. The motifs that we select on the basis of our heuristic will
result in a biologically relevant alignment that includes the
maximal number of species. As such, our heuristic tries to
overcome the fact that Gibbs sampling is intrinsically unable
to cope with correlated data. Note that the motif of interest
(PmrA motif) does not necessarily have to correspond to the
motif used to produce the alignment.

http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/2/R9

We showed that our in silico phylogenetic footprinting
approach can be used to confirm targets detected by genomewide screening. So far, it can only be used for species that
show a high degree of conservation in their intergenic
regions, similar to the conservation observed in this study. As
more complete genomic data become available, the approach
might be extended to other species.
As suggested previously [34], the high observed similarity in
intergenic sequences might be due to the small phylogenetic
distance between the species we analyzed. However, it cannot
be excluded that because of the small size of the intergenic
regions in bacteria and the very similar habitat and mechanism of regulation among the γ-proteobacterial species used
in this study, a large part of the complete intergenic region is
functional and therefore conserved. This hypothesis was also
put forward by Rajewsky et al. [41]. The alignment of the
intergenic region of the well-characterized ugd indeed points
in that direction. Large parts of the conserved regions of the
alignments correspond to experimentally verified motifs.
Remarkably, most potential PmrAB-regulated genes exhibited a footprint of the PmrA motif in E. coli only, and several
target genes had no counterpart at all in organisms other than
Salmonella species. This indicates a high degree of specialization of the PmrAB two-component system in Salmonella.
Such specialization could also explain the considerable differences between PmrAB-dependent regulons in related species.
For instance, in both Y. pestis and S. typhimurium the attenuated virulence of phoP mutants is ascribed to a defect in LPS
modification, a process shown to be PmrAB-dependent [42].
So far, two S. typhimurium loci have been postulated to be
involved in this LPS remodeling: pmrHFIJKLM and ugd.
Only for pmrH did we detect an ortholog in Y. pestis and a
conserved footprint of the PmrA motif in the promoter region
of this ortholog. The Ugd protein does not even have a functional counterpart in Y. pestis. This low similarity in PmrAB
regulon composition indicates that a different network of
genes must be responsible for a similar phenotype in distinct
species. This is not completely unexpected in view of the very
different LPS composition of Salmonella and Y. pestis [42].
For most of the known experimentally verified targets, clear
phylogenetic footprints of the PmrA motif could be detected
in the intergenic regions of close homologs. In the intergenic
region of pmrD we could recover the consensus sequence
only partially (that is, one half-site) because the second halfsite overlaps with the coding region (data not shown) and this
was not included in the current analysis. Another PhoPQdependent gene that contributes to resistance to antimicrobial peptides is mig-14 [10]. However, we could not find the
presence of a clear PmrA consensus in the promoter of mig14. Neither could we detect a PmrA motif in dgoA, which was
previously shown to be regulated by PmrAB [22]. This would
indicate that both targets are only indirectly dependent on

PmrAB. It can, however, not be excluded that they represent
false negatives of our screening.

Despite its low expression level in our in vitro conditions, the
sseJ fusion showed a clear PmrAB-dependent induction by
Fe3+ excess. SseJ is a secreted effector protein that is translocated across the membrane of the Salmonella-containing
vacuole (SCV) by SPI-2. From recent evidence it was speculated that the putative acyltransferase activity of SseJ would
be involved in modifying the lipid composition of the SCV
[47,48], thereby interfering with the trafficking and maturation properties of the SCV in infected cells. The PmrAdependence of sseJ would therefore link expression of genes
involved in bacterial LPS modification with those involved in
regulating the lipid composition of the SCV membrane.
Further experimental analysis will shed light on how these
previously undescribed PmrAB-dependent proteins, with
unknown functions, relate to the known part of the PmrABdependent regulon.

Site-directed mutagenesis of the PmrA box in the yibD promoter indicated a crucial role for the T at position 3 and the A
at position 5 of the first half-site of the motif. As can be
deduced from the consensus site in Figure 4, no degeneracy is
allowed at positions 3 and 5. This observation allows us to
extrapolate to a certain extent the sequence requirements of
the PmrA box in yibD to other PmrAB targets. Some positions
seem essential, whereas it appears that the specific choice of
nucleotide at the other positions affects the level of induction.
By altering the nucleotides, the binding affinities of the regulatory protein to the box can be modified, allowing specific
fine-tuning of gene expression in a cell.

deposited research

The extent to which each of the tested strains reacted to the
signals Fe3+ or/and Mg2+ varied considerably. This is not surprising in view of the complex regulatory system that integrates both these signals. Indeed, both signals are transduced
via the PhoPQ, PmrD, PmrAB multicomponent system,
which includes a posttranslational signal transduction and a
transcriptional feedback loop [1]. Depending on the affinities
between the interacting components of such dynamic systems, small changes in the initial concentrations of the components might result in large differences in the observed
expression levels [49]. A more detailed study of the dynamics
of this system might reveal how such systems can integrate
signals so differently.

reports

To confirm the predictive power of our methodology further,
four putative PmrAB targets were validated biologically.
Expression analysis clearly demonstrated PmrAB-dependence of yibD, which confirms the recent observations of
Tamayo et al. [22]. The observed PmrA-dependence of mig13 accords with its being upregulated in macrophages in in
vivo conditions [40]. The clear PmrAB-dependence of aroQ,
which encodes a periplasmic chorismate mutase, is striking.
In general, chorismate mutases are involved in the synthesis
of tyrosine and phenylalanine and are key to the synthesis of
a plethora of secondary metabolites [45]. The function of
periplasmic chorismate mutases, which differ from the cytoplasmic chorismate mutases in their long carboxy-terminal
extension [46], is still unclear. Periplasmic AroQ proteins
have also been detected in Y. pestis, Pseudomonas aerugi-

nosa, Mycobacterium species, Erwinia herbicola and in the
phytoparasitic nematode Meloidogyne javanica [46]. Strikingly, all these organisms containing AroQ interact with a
eukaryotic host. This observation, together with the fact that
AroQ is dependent on the key virulence regulator PmrAB in S.
typhimurium, suggests that the as-yet-unknown function of
AroQ might be involved in bacteria-host interactions.

reviews

Phage remnants, such as mig-3, have been described as macrophage inducible, PhoPQ-dependent genes [40], and thus
can be PmrAB-dependent. This might explain the PmrA motif
in the intergenic region between STM1868A and mig-3.
Detweiler et al. showed that two genes, virK and somA, both
coexpressed with the SPI-2 system, confer resistance to cationic peptides and their expression is PhoPQ-dependent. Also,
four fimbrial operons had genes that were coexpressed with
SPI-2 [43]. Predictions of the PmrAB-dependence of sseJ,
which encodes a secreted effector of the SPI-2 system, or of
genes that are involved in fimbrial synthesis (such as in lpfA,
encoding the S. typhimurium long polar fimbria A precursor), could therefore be in agreement with these findings.
Recently, the study of Kim et al. related PmrAB-dependent
regulation to swarming motility functions in S. typhimurium
[44]. This could explain why we detected a putative PmrA
motif in the intergenic region of flhC, which encodes a master
transcriptional activator of flagellar genes.

Marchal et al. R9.15

comment

As well as the known targets, several putative new predictions
could be made. Some of these predictions are consistent with
previously published observations. Indeed, the PmrAB system is part of a complex regulatory cascade acting downstream of the pleiotropic PhoPQ system. The PhoPQ regulon
is responsible for intracellular survival of bacteria and genes
dependent on PhoPQ are induced in bacteria inside macrophages. Part of the PhoPQ regulon has been discovered to be
dependent only indirectly on PhoPQ, via PmrAB. This
PmrAB-dependent subset is known to confer resistance to
cationic peptides by encoding genes involved in LPS modification and genes contributing to resistance to raised Fe3+ concentration. Genes encoding proteins involved in modification
of membrane components and outer-membrane proteins are
therefore sensible additional putative PmrAB targets.
Another target worth mentioning in view of the Fe3+-sensitivity of the PmrAB system is yncD, which encodes a putative
outer-membrane receptor for iron transport.

Conclusions

We conclusively demonstrate that our in silico approach reliably identifies additional PmrAB-dependent targets.
Although false positives will still be present among these predicted targets, the method offers an interesting approach for
further elucidation of genetic networks involved in the
expression of S. typhimurium virulence genes. We predicted
the PmrAB-dependent regulation of four additional targets:
yibD, aroQ, mig-13 and sseJ. Our approach might become
extendable to other species when more genome sequences
become available.

Materials and methods
Selection of intergenic sequences
Genome sequences were obtained from GenBank [50]. All
intergenic regions used in this study were extracted using the
modules of INCLUSive [51] to automatically parse GenBank
entries [52]. Here, we define an intergenic sequence as a
region that contains the noncoding sequence between two
coding regions. No overlap with coding regions is allowed.
Intergenic regions with lengths smaller than 10 base-pairs
(bp) were discarded because of computational reasons.

Construction of motif models
A motif model (a probabilistic representation of the consensus DNA pattern that is recognized by the respective regulatory protein) for PmrA was constructed using MotifSampler
[53]. The PmrA training set consisted of the promoter regions
of three known PmrAB-regulated genes (ugd [7,15,17], pmrH
[7,14,17,19] and pmrC [2,14]) for which the binding of the
PmrA protein to the promoter regions was verified by DNA
footprint analysis [14,15].

Genome-wide screening
The intergenic regions of the complete genome of S. typhimurium LT2 (NC_003197 [38]) were screened using MotifLocator [54,55]. The scoring scheme used by MotifLocator is
extensively described in Thijs et al. [55] and uses an extension
of the classical position-weight matrix scoring scheme [56].
Given the motif model θ and the background model Bm a score
W(x) is computed for each window x of length l in the
sequence S. W(x) compares the score of the subsequence
within the window being generated by the motif model to the
score of the subsequence within the window being generated
by the background model. bj: nucleotide at position j in the
segment.

W ( x ) = log(

P( x | )
=
P ( x | S , Bm )

l

∑ [log(
j =1

j ) − log( P( b j |

S, Bm ))]

Both the plus and minus strand were screened using a background model of order 3. The higher-order background
allows implicit compensation for motifs that are located in a
context highly resembling the global nucleotide composition

http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/2/R9

of the genome. To apply a threshold on the scores, the scores
of different motifs were normalized such that their values
ranged between 0 and 1. The normalized scores W ( x ) are displayed in Table 1.

W (x) =

W ( x ) − Wmin
with Wmin = min W ( x ) and Wmax = max W ( x ).
x
x
Wmax − Wmin

Hits with a score above 0.75 were retained (corresponding to
a selection of the 0.003% top-scoring hits of the total number
of possible motif positions in the genome. Possible positions
are identified as overlapping windows of length l). To give a
rough assessment of the number of hits with a score similar to
the chosen threshold that could be expected from the specific
nucleotide composition of the genome, we generated 100 random sets of intergenic sequences using a third-order background model. These random sets were scored with the same
PmrA motif model. From these results it appeared that the
true set contained three times more hits with a score above
the threshold than an average random genome.

Identification of datasets
Highly similar homologs of the putative PmrAB-regulated
genes were identified in the genome sequences of S. typhimurium (NC_003197), S. typhi (NC_003198), S. flexneri
(NC_004337), E. coli O157:H7 (NC_002695), E. coli
O157:H7 EDL933 (NC_002655), E. coli K12 (NC_000913), Y.
pestis CO92 (NC_003143) and Y. pestis KIM (NC_004088).
In general, only true orthologs are likely to have retained a
similar function and therefore a similar mechanism of regulation [35]. However, ortholog identification is a difficult problem and discriminating between true orthologs and paralogs
is not always straightforward. Because our motif-detection
algorithm is, to some extent, robust against the presence of
noise and allows for the presence of sequences that do not
contain the motif [57], we did not make an a priori distinction
between true orthologs and paralogs if both appeared highly
similar to the original protein. This motivated us to use the
principle of clusters of orthologs for dataset construction
[58]. The pairwise BLAST scores obtained by mutually aligning the whole-genome sequences using BlastP [59] were used
as input of the cluster program TRIBE-MCL [60]. Stringent
criteria were applied to retain only closely related orthologs
and paralogs (cut-off of the BLAST hit was an E-value of 1e80). For those proteins that, when BLASTed against themselves, gave rise to an E-value higher than 1e-80 (yjbE,
STM1926, STM0344, yhcN, STM1868A, yceP, atpF, yjgD,
csrA, ybfA) the threshold was relaxed (E-value 1e-20). The
choice of the stringent threshold was essential to maximally
reduce the noise in the datasets.

Phylogenetic footprinting by Gibbs sampling
We used a two-step procedure for phylogenetic footprinting.
In the first step, Gibbs sampling is performed to generate a
list of motifs. Subsequently, local alignments are generated by

selecting motifs that can be used as alignment seeds and by
assessing the relevance of the alignments by a test statistic.

but not the interspecies homology between intergenic regions
(for example, between E. coli and Salmonella). All alignments
with a p-value less than 0.15 (the p-value of ugd) were considered as relevant (indicated in Table 1 with 'm'). Because the
obtained alignments are local, they are gapless. In some
cases, more than one alignment might be essential to cover
the complete intergenic region.
Selected alignments are displayed in the supplementary
information at [39]. Sequence editing was done in BioEdit
[63].

Functional annotation

Molecular methods
Plasmid DNA, after passage through S. typhimurium LB5010
[67], was introduced into bacterial strains by electroporation.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out in a Personal Mastercycler (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) with
Pfx DNA polymerase, using the manufacturer's instructions.
The constructs containing the putative promoter regions of
yibD, mig-13, aroQ, sseJ and pmrC and the site-directed
mutated yibD promoter fragments were all verified by
sequence analysis.

interactions

Construction of plasmids
To construct the gfp reporter fusions of yibD, mig-13, aroQ,
sseJ and pmrC, the primers listed in Table 4 were used in a
PCR reaction (as described above) to amplify the respective
promoter regions from the ATCC14028s genome. Restriction
sites in the primers are indicated in bold face in Table 4. The
promoter fragments were digested with EcoRI and BamHI

Genome Biology 2004, 5:R9

information

To assign a more quantitative criterion to the alignment, a pvalue was assigned to each alignment that was calculated as
follows: for each window of 100 bp around the motif, the largest conserved block not overlapping with the core motif was
identified (using the consensus score of minimal 0.7 as minimal similarity measure). This p-value expresses the probability of observing a conserved block of the same length in a
randomly aligned dataset of similar composition. Distributions of conserved blocks in randomly aligned sequences were
constructed [62]. These random datasets take into account
the observed high pairwise sequence homology between
intergenic sequences derived from similar species (serovars)
(homology between E. coli sequences, homology between Salmonella sequences, homology between Y. pestis sequences),

The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed
in Table 3. Bacteria were grown overnight at 37°C with aeration in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth or in the nitrogen minimal
medium of Nelson and Kennedy [65] with modifications as
previously described [66]. The pH of the medium was buffered with 100 mM Tris-HCl, adjusted to pH 7.4 or pH 5.8.
MgCl2 was added at a final concentration of 10 µM or 10 mM.
FeCl3 was used at a final concentration of 100 µM from a
freshly prepared 10 mM stock. Antibiotics were used, when
appropriate, at the following concentrations: tetracycline, 30
µg/ml; and ampicillin, 100 µg/ml.

refereed research

From the obtained list, motifs that could be used as seeds to
generate a biologically relevant alignment were selected using
a heuristic [61]. Motifs with a high LL-score that occurred
preferentially once in each sequence were chosen (starting
with those motifs that had the highest consensus score).
Moreover, we preferentially selected motifs that occurred in
the maximal number of species. For each dataset, multiple
alignments were constructed using the position of these
retrieved motifs as alignment initializations (seeds) until a
reliable alignment was obtained. The alignment was considered biologically relevant if within a window of 100 bp around
the motif it exhibited a degree of conservation that reflected
the overall observed homology between intergenic sequences
of the selected species (interspecies homology).

reports

Functional annotation was derived from the National Center
for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) [38,52] and from the
Sanger annotation of S. typhi [64]. Specific genomic context
was derived from NCBI [38,52]. The distribution of the putative targets (unique for Salmonella species versus more
widely distributed), as derived from our clusters of orthologous groups (COGs), was verified by comparison to the analysis of McClelland et al. [38], who included, in addition to the
species we used, several subspecies of Salmonella (six
genomes), and species more distantly related to Salmonella
(Klebsiella pneumoniae).

reviews

An advanced Gibbs sampling procedure for motif detection
was used (MotifSampler). MotifSampler allows us to search
for overrepresented motifs in each dataset. The motif length,
the maximal number of different motifs and the background
model are user-defined parameter settings of the algorithm
described in Thijs et al. [53]. A recent extension of the algorithm allows to automatically determine the number of
instances of a certain motif per sequence [55] and requires a
predefined indication on the prior probability of expecting at
least one motif per sequence. For each dataset, 100 runs of the
MotifSampler were performed under the following
conditions: motif lengths varying from 6, 8, 10, 12; background order 0; prior probability default value 0.7. Because
Gibbs sampling is a stochastic procedure, each run can give
rise to different motifs. To summarize the results from the
100 runs, all detected motifs were mutually compared and
similar motifs were grouped. The information content was
used as a similarity measure to compare motifs. For each
dataset, therefore, a list of different potential motifs was
obtained. Motifs in this list were ranked according to their
log-likelihood score (LL-score) [53].

were subcloned into pFPV25 (EcoRI/BamHI), resulting in
plasmids pCMPG5615 → pCMPG5620, as listed in Table 3.
These reporter plasmids were electroporated into
ATCC14028s and JSG421.
