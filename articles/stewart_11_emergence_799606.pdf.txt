Abstract
Background: Lamivudine (3TC) is a potent inhibitor of both Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and Human Immunodeficiency
Virus (HIV) replication and is part of first-line highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in the Gambia.
Unfortunately, the effectiveness of 3TC against HBV is limited by the emergence of resistant strains.
Aim: The aim of this retrospective study was to characterise 3TC-resistant mutations in HBV from co-infected
patients receiving HAART, by generating HBV polymerase sequence data and viral loads from HBV genotype E
infected patients, both at initiation and during a course of 3TC therapy.
Method: Samples from 21 HBV chronic carriers co-infected with HIV-1 (n = 18), HIV-2 (n = 2) and HIV-dual (n = 1)
receiving HAART for a period of 6-52 months were analysed for the emergence of 3TC-resistance mutations.
Findings: Sixteen out of 21 HBV/HIV co-infected patients responded well to HAART treatment maintaining
suppression of HBV viraemia to low (≤ 104 copies/mL) (n = 5) or undetectable levels (< 260 copies/ml) (n = 11).
Out of the 5 non-responders, 3 had developed 3TC-resistant HBV strains showing mutations in the YMDD motif at
position 204 of the RT domain of the HBV polymerase. One patient showed the M204V+ L180M+ V173L+ triple
mutation associated with a vaccine escape phenotype, which could be of public health concern in a country with
a national HBV vaccination programme. All except one patient was infected with HBV genotype E.
Conclusions: Our findings confirm the risk of 3TC mutations in HAART patients following monotherapy. This is a
novel study on 3TC resistance in HBV genotype E patients and encourage the use of tenofovir (in association with
3TC), which has not shown unequivocally documented HBV resistance to date, as part of first-line therapy in HIV/
HBV co-infected patients in West Africa.
HBV- hepatitis B infection; HIV- human immunodeficiency virus; HAART- antiretroviral therapy.

Background
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) both pose significant public health challenges in the developing world. Globally, approximately
10% of HIV- infected individuals are also chronic carriers of HBV [1] as a consequence of shared modes of
transmission. In The Gambia, where HBV is endemic
the figure is closer to 15%, with HBV infection

occurring most commonly before the age of 4 years and
usually preceding HIV infection [2,3].
Untreated HIV/HBV co-infection is characterised by
higher HBV viral loads [4] and a reduction in the frequency of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion
to antibody against HBe (anti-HBe), which is predictive
of poorer clinical outcomes [5]. HIV/HBV co-infection
is associated with higher liver-related morbidity and
mortality compared to mono-infection with either virus
[6]. With the increasing availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) liver disease has become a
leading cause of non-acquired immunodeficiency

syndrome (AIDS)- related death in HIV/HBV coinfected patients [6].
In 1997 the Food and Drug Administration approved
the use of 3TC, an orally-administered nucleoside analogue that potently suppresses replication of both HBV
and HIV [7]. Based on WHO guidance, this drug is
included in first-line HIV treatment in the Genito-Urinary Medicine (GUM) clinic in The Gambia; and is the
only HBV-active drug routinely received by ART-naïve
patients. Patient on 3TC monotherapy are at risk of
developing resistant mutations following 1-2 years of
treatment. Four major patterns of resistance mutations
have been described. with the most important occurring
in the highly conserved tyrosine-methionine-asparateaspartate (YMDD) motif, involving a change from
methionine at position 204 in the reverse transcriptase
domain (rt204) to either a valine or isoleucine residue
(rtM204V/I) or, more rarely, a serine residue [8,9].
Compensatory mutations at other sites are usually
required to reduce the loss in replication fitness associated with YMDD mutants [10,11]. As a result of significant open reading frame overlap in the HBV
genome, changes in polymerase can lead to changes in
the surface region which can induce changes in HBsAg
secretion with significant reduction in HBsAg antigenicity [12-15].
As a result of the important role played by the
secreted hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in immune
recognition following vaccination, mutations in the HBV
surface gene can have diagnostic and public health
implications for universal vaccination programme.
The aims of this retrospective study was to, characterise 3TC resistance mutations in HBV genotype E
chronic carriers receiving HAART.

Results
From an initial cohort of 31 HIV/HBV co-infected
patients on HAART, 9 were excluded from the study
either due to doubts about adherence to therapy (n =
2), seroreversion from serum HBsAg positive to
HBsAg- negative during the recruitment period, prior
to start of treatment (n = 1) or had been on treatment for < 6 months (n = 6). A 10 t h patient was
excluded because the patient’s virus had the M204I
mutation at the initiation of HAART and further
investigation revealed that this patient had previously
been on zidovudine AZT/3TC dual therapy when the
mutation was likely to have emerged. The baseline
characteristics of the remaining 21 patients are summarised in Table 1. The patients were all adults, (>
18 yrs old) and were co-infected with HIV-1 (n = 18),
HIV-2 (n-2) or HIV-1 plus HIV-2 (n = 1). Pre-treatment HBV viral loads ranged from undetectable levels
(< 260 copies/mL) to 1.0 × 10 9 copies/mL. Baseline

Page 2 of 6

HBV viral load was high (≥ 10 5 copies/mL) in the 6
HBeAg-positive patients and in 7/15 of the HBeAgnegative patients. Patients with high HBV DNA loads
tended to have higher alanine aminotransferase and
aspartate aminotransferase liver enzyme concentrations. The DNA sequence of all except one patient,
were similar to HBV genotype E.
Response to therapy

The median treatment duration was 25 (range 6 - 52)
months. Patients were defined as responders to 3TC
therapy if HBV viral loads were reduced to (≤ 10 4
copies/ml) and if they showed sustained viraemic suppression throughout the period under study or as nonresponders if their viral load remained at high levels
throughout the study or showed > 104 copies/ml at the
end of the period of observation.
Sixteen (76.1%) patients responded well to 3TC treatment, achieving sustained suppression of HBV viraemia;
11 of the 16 (68.7%) patients had undetectable HBV
DNA; 3 (50%) of the HBeAg-positive individuals
(Patients 10, 18 &19) successfully seroconverted to
HBeAg antibody positive and 1 of them (Patient 10)
achieved loss of HBsAg as well. Two (66.6%) of the 3
who had seroconverted to HBeAg antibody positive had
viral load concentrations of 104 or 103 DNA copies per
mL respectively.
The DNA sequences of 2 patients who did not
respond to treatment and maintained HBV viral loads of
> 104 copies/mL were similar to the wild-type sequence
and not the 3TC-resistance mutations.
All, except 3 of the co-infected patients on HAART (#
9, 10 & 28) achieved reduction in HIV viral load (≤ 1.0
× 102 copies/mL) during the period of the study. Two
of these patents were HBeAg positive at the start of
therapy. Despite maintaining high levels of HIV RNA
(1.0 × 10 4 copies/mL), one of them (#10) responded
well to HBV treatment; achieving HBsAg clearance, and
displaying HBeAg seroconversion and reduction in HBV
viral load from 108 copies/mL to 103 copies/mL whilst
the other patient (#9) maintained high levels of both
HIV RNA (104 copies/mL) and HBV DNA (109 copies/
mL).
HBV-resistance mutations

Alignment of the HBV RT sequences is shown in Figure
1. HBV resistance to 3TC was found in 3 of 21 (14.2%)
co-infected patients including the one patient (#6) with
HIV-dual infection who also tested positive for HBeAg
(Tables 1 and 2). The remaining 2 patients with 3TCresistance mutations (# 12 & 13) were infected with a
single HIV-1 strain. Patients with 3TC mutations had
HBV viral load ≥ 104 copies/mL throughout the period
of observation.

The upper normal limit of ALT and AST liver enzyme levels is 46 international units/ml (IU/mL; NT-samples were not tested for AST and ALT.
The lower limit of detection of real-time PCR was 260 copies/mL (c/mL) and 100 copies/mL for HBV and HIV respectively.

Figure 1 shows the amino acid sequence alignment of
the HBV reverse transcriptase region surrounding the
YMDD motif at the start of 3TC treatment and at the
most recent time points. The M204V mutation was
always accompanied by the mutation L180M. The virus
from patient 12 had an S219A mutation, which reverted
to the wild-type when 3TC resistance mutations V173L,
L180M and M204V were acquired. Phylogenetic analysis
of the HBV polymerase gene sequences showed close
similarity with HBV genotype E, except in the case of 1
patient whose sequences were similar to HBV genotype
A (data not shown).

Discussion
We retrospectively studied 21 HBV-HIV co-infected
individuals on HAART to determine the patterns of
3TC resistance mutations. Apart from studies on the
immune response to HAART treatment, we are not
aware of any published studies on 3TC mutations from
West Africa, a region where HBV genotype E infection
predominates [16]. In our study, 11 out of 21 patients
(52.3%) displayed undetectable viral load at the last
point of data collection. The remaining 5 patients had
high viral load at the last observation point including 3
patients who had seroconverted to anti-HBe. HBeAg

Figure 1 Amino acid sequence alignment generated from samples at baseline and at most recent time points covering amino acids
161 - 236 of the HBV reverse transcriptase domain. The HBV RT sequences are aligned with reference genotype E sequence (X75664) which
is shown at the top, alignment with patient sequence is shown below with identities marked as (.) and sequence changes indicated by letter.
Sequences from patients who developed YMDD mutations (patients 6, 12 and 13) during 3TC therapy are shown at the top half of the figure.
The baseline and post treatment time points are represented by ‘01’ and ‘02’ respectively.

seroconversion usually confers a favourable outcome,
however, HBV pre-core (PC) and basal core promoter
(BCP) mutations should be excluded because of the clinical implications which could result from enhanced HBV
replication or abrogation of HBeAg translation [17].
The observation of patient testing negative for HBsAg
at the last point of observation should also be interpreted with caution, since the apparent loss of HBsAg
may be due to a poor sensitivity and/or specificity of the
assay in detecting mutation in the ‘a’ determinant region
of HBsAg.
Because of the variation in the period of patient observation, it will be difficult to acurately define the rates of
the events of HBeAg seroconversion or HBsAg
clearance.
Despite its high efficacy, 3TC is not recommended for
use as HBV monotherapy in HIV/HBV co-infected
patients because of the risk of emergence of resistance
mutations in HBV [18]. Similarly, the European AIDS
Clinical Society guidelines for treatment of HBV/HIV
co-infected patients recommend that patients with no
indication of anti-HIV treatment should not be treated
with drugs such as 3TC, entacavir and tenofovir because
of the risk of developing HIV-resistant mutations [19].
However, the criteria for treatment for the patients in
the study were based solely on their HIV status.

Although HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections currently show
similar prevalence in The Gambia, patients infected with
HIV-2 are far less likely to progress to AIDS than
patients infected with HIV-1 [20]; thus when considering all HIV-1 and HIV-2 patients on HAART, there is a
bias towards HIV-1 infections.
The introduction of 3TC-containing HAART is a relatively recent development in The Gambia, and therefore,
3TC-resistance mutations were not observed in therapynaïve individuals in the present study. However, with
the continued use of 3TC as the only HBV-active drug
in HAART patients, the proportion of resistant strains
may increase with time, which will significantly reduce
HBV treatment effectiveness [21].
Thus due to the potential association of the triple 3TC
mutations (M204V + L180M + V173L + ) with vaccine
escape mutants, the continuous surveillance of resistance mutants is necessary in a country with a national
HBV vaccination programme [22,23]. Additionally, with
the decline in HIV-associated morbidity and mortality
following the introduction of HAART, there is a need
for screening of HIV patients for underlying viral hepatitis co-infection and the provision of management and
treatment recommendations for patients with chronic
viral hepatitis in preventing the development of liver
disease.

Materials and methods

Biochemical assays

Subjects

Liver function tests were performed using Vitros DT60
II Chemistry analyzer (Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics,
Bucks, UK) according to manufacturer’s instructions.

Five hundred and seventy HIV-positive individuals were
screened for hepatitis B markers. Seventy (12.2%) of
them were HBsAg-positive and 31 were receiving
HAART that included 3TC (300 mg/day). Samples from
21 out of the 31 co-infected patients receiving HAART
were analysed retrospectively. Six (28.5%) of the 21
patients tested positive for HBeAg, 18 (85.7%) for HIV1,
2 (9.5%) for HIV-2 and 1 for HIV-dual infections. The
HIV viral load ranged from undetectable to 1.1 × 10 9
(Table 2).
Seventeen of these patients had received 3TC in combination with another reverse transcriptase inhibitor
(NRTI) usually AZT or Stavudine, and a non-nucleoside
reverse transcriptase inhibitor, nevirapine or efavirenz.
The four remaining patients received a combination of
AZT, 3TC and lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), either due to
HIV-2 or HIV-1/2 dual infection, or previous exposure
to single dose nevirapine. Two individuals moved onto
second-line HIV-1 therapy of Tenofovir (TDF), an
NRTI dually active against HBV and HIV, in combination with AZT, 3TC and LPV/r following non-suppression of HIV viraemia by first-line therapy. Patients were
excluded from the study if there were any doubts as to
their compliance to therapy (critical in the effectiveness
of 3TC) [21]. Ethical approval was granted by the joint
Gambia Government/MRC Ethics Committee. All subjects and/or legal guardians provided written, informed
consent.
Serological assays

Detection of HBsAg was performed using Determine™ HBsAg immunochromatographic test (Abbott
Laboratories, USA). Samples were also tested for
HBeAg and anti-HBe using an ELISA assay (DiaSorin,
Salugia, Italy).
CD4 T-cell count and HIV-1/HIV-2 viral load determination

Absolute CD4 T cell counts as well as CD4 lymphocyte
proportions were determined by flow cytometry (Becton-Dickinson, Belgium) and plasma HIV-1 and HIV-2
viral load measurements made using an in-house quantitative PCR (qPCR) methodology as described previously [24].

Determination of HBV viral loads by real-time qPCR

Measurement of HBV viral load was performed using an
in-house SYBR-Green method according to a previously
described protocol [25], with primers HBV Taq 1 and
HBV Taq 2 (Table 3). The limit of detection for the
assay was 260 copies/mL and samples with viral loads
higher than the top of the standard curve were diluted
1:1000 and retested.
Amplification and sequencing of YMDD region of HBV
polymerase gene

Primers for polymerase amplification were designed on
the basis of conserved regions both flanking and within
the reverse transcriptase region of the HBV polymerase
gene, using a consensus sequence generated from reference sequences of genotypes E and A, as these are the
most commonly encountered HBV genotypes in The
Gambia [26,27]. The primers were synthesized by Metabion International AG (Planegg, Germany) and subsequently diluted to a concentration of 10 μM for use,
according to manufacturer’s instructions (Table 3).
Twenty microliters of serum was diluted 1:10 in
nuclease-free water and HBV DNA extracted using the
QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Crawley, West Sussex, UK) and then re-suspended in 100 μL water. The
50-uL PCR reaction mix contained 5 μL of purified
HBV DNA 25 μL HotStar Taq Master Kit (Qiagen)
and 2.0 uL each of MMHBRT5 and MM HBRT6 primers. The PCR thermocycler conditions were optimised with an initial incubation at 95°C (15 mins), 40
cycles at 94°C (30 s) for denaturation, 52°C (30 s)
annealing followed by extension at 72°C (1 min) which
resulted in the amplification of 577-bp length of the
reverse transcriptase domain covering the YMDD
region. PCR products were then cleaned using the
QIAquick ® agarose gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and
sent to Macrogen, Korea for direct single-extension
sequencing using the same primers (MMHBRT5 and
MMHBRT6) and 3730 × l DNA analyzer (PE Applied
Biosystems, Warrington, UK).

Data management

DNA sequences were edited and assembled using SeqMan and aligned using MegAlign Lasergene software
(DNAstar, Madison, WI, USA) with reference sequences
of genotype E and A [accession numbers X75664 (Kou)
and AM410963 respectively].
