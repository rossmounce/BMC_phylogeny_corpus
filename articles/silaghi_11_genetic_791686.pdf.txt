Genetic variants of Anaplasma phagocytophilum
from 14 equine granulocytic anaplasmosis cases
Cornelia Silaghi1*, Gabriele Liebisch2 and Kurt Pfister1

Abstract
Background: Equine Granulocytic Anaplasmosis (EGA) is caused by Anaplasma phagocytophilum, a tick-transmitted,
obligate intracellular bacterium. In Europe, it is transmitted by Ixodes ricinus. A large number of genetic variants of
A. phagocytophilum circulate in nature and have been found in ticks and different animals. Attempts have been
made to assign certain genetic variants to certain host species or pathologies, but have not been successful so far.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the causing agent A. phagocytophilum of 14 cases of EGA in naturally
infected horses with molecular methods on the basis of 4 partial genes (16S rRNA, groEL, msp2, and msp4).
Results: All DNA extracts of EDTA-blood samples of the horses gave bands of the correct nucleotide size in all four
genotyping PCRs. Sequence analysis revealed 4 different variants in the partial 16S rRNA, groEL gene and msp2
genes, and 3 in the msp4 gene. One 16S rRNA gene variant involved in 11 of the 14 cases was identical to the
“prototype” variant causing disease in humans in the amplified part [GenBank: U02521]. Phylogenetic analysis
revealed as expected for the groEL gene that sequences from horses clustered separately from roe deer. Sequences
of the partial msp2 gene from this study formed a separate cluster from ruminant variants in Europe and from all
US variants.
Conclusions: The results show that more than one variant of A. phagocytophilum seems to be involved in EGA in
Germany. The comparative genetic analysis of the variants involved points towards different natural cycles in the
epidemiology of A. phagocytophilum, possibly involving different reservoir hosts or host adaptation, rather than a
strict species separation.

Background
Equine Granulocytic Anaplasmosis (EGA) is caused by
Anaplasma phagocytophilum, a tick-transmitted, obligate intracellular bacterium. The vectors are ticks of the
genus Ixodes; the main vector in Europe is I. ricinus, in
North America I. pacificus and I. scapularis. As no
transovarial transmission has been shown, a reservoir
animal is necessary for the maintenance in nature [1].
Before 2001, when a reclassification based on 16S rRNA
gene similarities was proposed, the causing agent of
EGA was known as Ehrlichia equi, which was part of
the E. phagocytophila group (including also E. phagocytophila, the causing agent of tick-borne fever of ruminants, and the Human Granulocytic Anaplasmosis

(HGA) - agent [2]). Different partial 16S rRNA gene variants of A. phagocytophilum have been detected in previous studies from various host animals and ticks [3-7].
The first case of EGA was reported from northern California in 1969 [8]. Since then reports came from North
America and different European countries [9-17]. EGA is
an acute febrile disease with an average incubation period
of 1-2 weeks. Clinical signs include high fever, depression,
anorexia, ataxia, icterus and a lower limb oedema; laboratory findings include thrombocytopenia, anaemia and leucopenia. These abnormalities have been shown both in
natural and experimental infections [14,18,19]. The
administration of tetracyclines is known as an effective
treatment [20], but experimental infection has demonstrated that horses can make a full recovery without treatment [21]. This may account for the relatively high
seropositivity as reported in horses in Italy (17.03%) and
Denmark (22.3%) [22,23]. No significant difference was
found in the seroprevalence between horses with or

without suspicion of vector-borne diseases, which suggests
the occurrence of subclinical infections [22]. Persistence of
A. phagocytophilum was demonstrated in the bloodstream
of horses after experimental infection and was not related
to clinical disease, raising the question about persistency
of a natural infection after an acute outbreak [21]. The
existence of persistent infection with a cyclic bacteraemia
has also been demonstrated in lambs after experimental
infection [24]. The epidemiology of A. phagocytophilum
differs between the continents: the outcome of disease in
humans is more severe in the US, whereas disease in cattle
is virtually non-existent; by contrast, disease is severe in
cattle and sheep in Europe, but much rarer and milder in
humans [1]. The A. phagocytophilum variant pathogenic
for cattle (formerly E. phagocytophila) caused a seroconversion in horses without clinical disease [25]. By contrast,
experimental infection with the HGA-agent caused a clinical disease in horses, undistinguishable from EGA [26]
and even the death of a horse in another experimental
study [27]. Genetic variations have been found previously
on basis of the 16S rRNA, groEL, msp2, msp4 and ankA
gene in A. phagocytophilum from ticks and animals, however it was not possible to attribute genetic variants to a
certain host or geographic origin [3,5-7,28-30]. These
investigations showed that A. phagocytophilum seems to
show certain genetic heterogeneity; because of this we
hypothesised that genetic heterogeneity would also exist in
A. phagocytophilum naturally infecting horses and causing
EGA. Several steps were taken: from 14 naturally infected
horses with clinical EGA, first the 16S rRNA gene was partially amplified and sequenced to gain a general overview
of the genetic variety involved. To further analyse the variants involved in equine infections, partial groEL, msp2,
and msp4 genes were amplified and sequenced. More than
one partial 16S rRNA gene variant was involved in equine
infection and genetic variations were also detected in the
other amplified parts of genes.

the “prototype” variant causing disease in humans in the
amplified part [GenBank: U02521]. The partial 16S
rRNA gene sequences from this study had 99% to 100%
similarity to each other and to the A. phagocytophilum
strain HZ [GenBank: NC_007797].
GroEL gene sequences

Four variants were also found in the partial groEL gene
(530 bp; here called “a” (n = 1), “b” (n = 11), “r” (n = 1),
“l” (n = 1)). The partial groEL gene sequences from this
study had 99% to 100% similarity on basis of nucleotides
to each other and 98% to 99% to the A. phagocytophilum strain HZ [GenBank: NC_007797]. These nucleotide changes in the partial groEL gene did not result in
amino acid changes.
Msp2 gene sequences

The partial msp2 gene revealed also 4 variants (893 bp;
here called “I” (n = 4), “II” (n = 7), “III” (n = 2), “IV” (n =
1)). The two main msp2 gene variants “I” and “II” only differed in a single nucleotide polymorphism in the amplified
part (nucleotide position 136), which resulted in one
amino acid exchange. Msp2 variant “III” had five nucleotide differences from “II” (resulting in one amino acid difference) and 6 nucleotide differences from “I” (resulting in
two amino acid differences). Type “IV” had 5 nucleotide
differences from “III”, 10 nucleotide differences from “II”
and 11 nucleotide differences from “I”, resulting in 3, 4
and 5 amino acid differences, respectively (Table 1). On
basis of nucleotides, all partial msp2 gene sequences from
this study had 98% to 100% similarity amongst each other
and 92% to 93% similarity to the A. phagocytophilum
strain HZ [NC_007797]. On basis of amino acids, the similarity was 98% to 100% for sequences from this study
amongst each other and 87% to 88% to the A. phagocytophilum strain HZ [GenBank: NC_007797].
Msp4 gene sequences

Results
All 14 samples were confirmed positive for A. phagocytophilum by using real-time PCR. The clinical data
available for these cases corresponded to the typical
clinical signs in EGA [19]. All four genotyping PCRs
gave bands of the correct nucleotide size for the partial
genes (16S rRNA, groEL, msp2 and msp4). The
sequences obtained from this study have been deposited
in GenBank [GenBank: JF893886-JF893940, JF907577].
The nucleotide differences are shown in Table 1.
16S rRNA gene sequences

Sequence analysis revealed 4 types in the partial 16S
rRNA gene (497 bp; here called “A” (n = 1), “B” (n =
11), “D” (n = 1), “S” (n = 1)). The 16S rRNA gene variant “B” involved in 11 of the 14 cases was identical to

Three variants were detected in the partial msp4 gene
(343 bp; here called “c“ (n = 11), “s“ (n = 1) and “d“ (n
= 1)). For one sequence only 306 bp could be evaluated.
The partial 343 bp msp4 gene sequences from this study
had 96% to 100% similarity on basis of nucleotides
amongst each other and 96% to 97% to the A. phagocytophilum strain HZ [GenBank: NC_007797]. The
nucleotide difference at position 427 in variant “d“
resulted in one amino acid exchange (Table 1).
For the 11 A. phagocytophilum samples from horses
with the 16S rRNA gene variant “B”, the msp4 ("variant
c”) and groEL (variant “b”) gene variant were identical,
whereas on the basis of the msp2 it was possible to distinguish two different types. The remaining three samples were different from each other in the partial
analysed genes and from the other 11 samples (Table 2).

Phylogenetic analysis

Phylogenetic analysis of the partial groEL (530 bp), the
partial msp2 (893 bp) and the partial msp4 (343 bp)
genes was performed with sequences from this study
and selected sequences from GenBank (Figure 1). As
previously shown, the groEL tree clustered into A. phagocytophilum sequences from roe deer and those from
other species. The horse sequences clustered within the
“other species” group (Figure 1A). Interestingly, one of
the partial groEL sequences from horses in this study
(variant “a"; GenBank [JF893919]) has been detected
previously in roe deer when comparing the amplified
530 bp, according to the GenBank entry [AF478558].
The msp2 phylogenetic tree showed clusters in
sequences from US and from Europe; and within these
clusters, ruminants clustered separately (Figure 1B). The
msp4 phylogenetic tree showed that also US strains
clustered separately from the European sequences. The
variant “c” clustered separately from the others with a

partial msp4 gene previously deposited in GenBank
whereas the other two variants “s“ and “d“ clustered
with sequences from ruminant species (Figure 1C).

Discussion
For 14 cases of EGA the causing agent A. phagocytophilum was analysed with molecular methods for variations
in four partial genes. Altogether, four different partial
16S rRNA gene variants of A. phagocytophilum were
detected to infect horses in Germany. The variant “B”
was found identical to the “prototype” variant causing
disease in humans in the amplified region [GenBank:
U02521] and it was discovered in 11 horses.
This variant has previously been detected in dogs,
horses and in roe deer, red deer and sheep
[31,32,17,15,7,5]. The 16S rRNA gene variant “B” seems
rather rare in ticks in Germany whereas the most frequent variant in ticks seems to be “A” [3, 29, 33, Schorn
S. unpublished data]. It was detected in a sample from

one horse in this study. 16S rRNA gene type “S” has
been detected in sheep, red deer, roe deer, ibex and I.
ricinus [7,3,5], whereas type “D” has not been detected
yet. Previous studies could not show a host species segregation on basis of the 16S rRNA gene [5,7]. However,
by comparing data from our study to GenBank and to
previous own investigations [6,7], it became evident that
there seem to be 16S rRNA gene variants infecting wild
and domestic ruminants (e.g. “X”,"Y” (Table 1), as
described in [6,7]), and others being the main variants
causing disease in humans, horses and dogs (e.g. “B";
[30,32,34]). This could thus indicate potential different
natural cycles, even when variants can not be attributed
to a particular species. Two variants detected from the
clinical EGA cases in this study ("B”, “S”) seem, however,
not confined to domestic animals, but also appear in
wild animals which might act as reservoirs (like red deer
and roe deer), whereas the possibly “apathogenic” variants ("X”, “Y”, Table 1), seem to be specific for wild
ruminant populations and possibly goats [6,7]. Several
questions remain unanswered: may a reservoir animal or
a tick form a “bridge” between a potential wild animal
and domestic cycle, or could the infection of domestic
animals be considered a “spill-over” of variants like “B”
and “S"? I. e. are all variants circulating in tick-ruminant
cycles, and only a small variety of those cause disease?
Horses, dogs and humans have previously been proposed as accidental hosts [35].
The American variant Ap-V1 (matching “X” [6,7] in
the amplified part of the 16S rRNA gene), which is supposedly apathogenic, probably has the white-tailed deer

as natural reservoir [36]. This variant seems not to cross
to dogs, horses and humans either. Two fully different
enzootic cycles in nature were suggested for the Western United States as there was no evidence for spatial,
genetic or clinical overlap between A. phagocytophilum
variants from granulocytic anaplasmosis cases (humans,
horses and dogs) and those from the natural wildlife
reservoir, the dusky-footed wood rat enzootic cycle [37].
The partial groEL gene variant “b” from this study has
previously been detected in horses with EGA in Europe
[15,19,38], but horses suffering from EGA from Italy
(Sardinia) contained different variants, which were not
detected in this study [28]. GroEL-variant “r” has previously been detected from red deer in Slovenia and “l”
has been previously detected from an I. ricinus tick in
Germany. GroEL-variant “a” has been detected from
both dog and roe deer in Slovenia. The clustering of the
groEL gene in phylogenetic analysis into a cluster containing sequences from roe deer and another containing
sequences derived from other species may show different ancestry for different A. phagocytophilum variants.
Some variants may have evolved in a natural cycle
adapted to roe deer which may be separate from other
variants involving other host species. However, the variant “a” has also been detected from roe deer, which
seems to be exceptional when comparing the clustering
of this and of previous studies [28]. This observation
deserves more attention in future studies on genetic variants of A. phagocytophilum. Whereas the observed
nucleotide substitutions in the partial groEL gene did
not result in amino acid changes, the variation in the

partial major surface protein 2 coding gene did. In the
phylogenetic analysis, the partial msp2 gene showed
strong clustering between the continents. This may be
due to a possible reaction or adaptation to the different
vector or host species in the different geographic locations, as it may reflect different host immunity and an
adaptation of the pathogen to it [39]. On the other
hand, it may be that host specificity or susceptibility are
more important than geographic origin. In an experimental study on cross transmission in the US, host susceptibility and transmissibility of A. phagocytophilum
may have played a more important role than the vector
tick itself [40], which suggests different reservoir host
cycles.
The amplification of the partial msp4 gene showed little heterogeneity among horses, both on the nucleotide
and at the amino acid level, whereas in large wild animals it showed great heterogeneity, also on amino acid
level [7]. In a previous study, the partial msp4 gene variants from ruminants and those from dogs, horses and
humans clustered separately [30]. It was suggested that
A. phagocytophilum from ruminants may share characteristics, like reservoir and pathogenicity, and that they
may be different from the variants found in humans.
This strengthens the hypothesis that different enzootic
cycles or niches of different variants possibly involving
different reservoir hosts exist in nature. A thorough
study of the ankA gene from different animal sources
came to similar conclusions [5,34]. It was hypothesised
that ruminant species can host a larger variety of A.
phagocytophilum isolates due to a possible co-evolution
of host and pathogen [34]. However, we detected two
variants in the partial msp4 gene that clustered within
the ruminant cluster. This raises the question whether
these two cases in the horses may represent a “spillover” from ruminant variants, or whether the clustering
of the msp4 gene phylogenetic tree may only be weakly
supported due to the relatively short sequence used for
the comparative analysis. The use of 16S rRNA gene or
parts of it as a tool for the molecular characterisation of
A. phagocytophilum has been criticized [4,5,32]. Nonetheless the 16S rRNA gene may be very useful, on a
broader level, for discriminating variants eliciting granulocytic anaplasmosis from those from a potential wild
ruminant cycle. Even though the true genetic variety
may be much larger as has been shown e.g. for ankA
and msp2 ([3]; results from this study) and a more comprehensive analysis of genetic variants is necessary, the
16S rRNA gene typing seems a good method for initial
typing.

Conclusions
We conclude that more than one genetic variant of A.
phagocytophilum infects horses and causes EGA in

Page 6 of 9

Germany and possibly elsewhere. One main causing variant was 100% similar in the amplified part of the partial
16S rRNA gene to the one pathogenic for humans [GenBank: U02521], but other variants caused clinically
apparent infection, too. Comparing this data to
sequence data from ticks another type ("A”) seems to be
the most prevalent one in ticks, but seems to be rather
rare in causing disease in horses [[29], Schorn et al.,
unpublished data]. This gives a strong basis for hypothesising that A. phagocytophilum may exist in different
natural cycles involving different reservoir hosts. This
tendency has also been shown in previous studies [5,30].
We further conclude that for a preliminary comparative
typing of A. phagocytophilum the partial 16S rRNA gene
seems a useful tool. Therefore, even when other genes
are studied for phylogenetic or other differentiation or
in the search for better markers for typing, 16S rRNA
variant typing should also be performed.

Methods
Horses and clinical assessment

Fourteen cases of clinical EGA, diagnosed from 2004 to
2009, were included in this study (Table 2). The horses
were from three federal states of Germany: Lower Saxony (n = 6), North-Rhine Westphalia (n = 6) and
Bavaria (n = 2) (Figure 2). The diagnosis which had
been requested by the veterinarians for routine diagnostics at the time of infection had been taken with Giemsa
stained buffy coat smears. In all 14 horses, morulae had
been detected in the granulocytes. For 3 horses, diagnosis at the time had also been taken by PCR. EDTAblood which was left over from the routine diagnosis of
the horses was preserved at -20°C for further use in this
study. All 14 animals were suffering from high fever, 8
of them recurring, 5 horses had icterus, 2 a lower limb
oedema, and further 2 anorexia. 13 animals showed
thrombocytopenia, 6 monocytopenia, and 5 lymphopenia, the total bilirubin was increased for 5 horses. 7
horses were previously treated with penicillin or other
antibiotics not acting against A. phagocytophilum.
DNA-Extraction and Polymerase Chain Reaction

DNA was extracted with the HighPure PCR Template
Preparation Kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). The presence of specific A. phagocytophilum DNA was verified
in all samples with a real-time PCR targeting the msp2
gene as previously described ([41,6]). The conditions
and primers for sequence analysis of the partial 16S
rRNA, groEL, msp2, and msp4 genes are listed in Table
3. The PCRs were carried out on the thermocyclers
GeneAmp System 2700/Veriti (Applied Biosystems,
Weiterstadt, Germany) or an Eppendorf Mastercycler
gradient (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). The HotStarTaq Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was used for all

PCR experiments. Positive (DNA of A. phagocytophilum
infected I. ricinus ticks) and negative (molecular biology
grade water) controls were included in each PCR run.
Successful amplification of the gene targets was verified
with 2.0% agarose gel-electrophoresis after staining with
GelRed® (Biotium, Hayward, USA) and visualized under
UV-light.
Sequence Analysis

PCR products were purified with the QIAquick PCR
Purification Kit according to manufacturer’s instruction
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and sent for sequencing with
forward and reverse primers (Table 3) to Eurofins
MWG Operon (Martinsried, Germany). The obtained
chromatograms were evaluated with Chromas © Lite
http://www.technelysium.com.au/chromas_lite.html.
ClustalW2 was used to perform multiple sequence alignment of the sequences [45]. Nucleotide sequences were
translated to amino acid level using Transeq http://
www.ebi.ac.uk/emboss/transeq/. Sequence homology
searches were made by BLASTn analysis of GenBank
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.library.vu.edu.au/BLAST/.
Phylogenetic analysis

Figure 2 Map of Germany showing the origin of the horses
included in this study. The location where the horses were
staying at the time of diagnosis is shown according to the postal
code in the respective districts (shaded in red) within the federal
states. The map was created with Regiograph (GfK MACON AG,
Waghäusel, Germany).

Phylogenetic analysis was carried out with the PHYLIP
3.67 software package [46] using the neighbor joining
method. For this analysis 33 sequences of the partial
groEL gene, 16 of the partial msp2 gene and 22 of the
partial msp4 gene were used from GenBank. Distance
matrices were calculated with the Kimura 2-parameter
method using DNADIST. A bootstrap analysis was performed to test the stability of the trees with 1000
