Abstract
Background: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is one of the leading causes of viral hepatitis worldwide and its genotype 3a
is predominant in vast areas of Pakistan.
Findings: The present study reports the first full sequence of HCV 3a isolate PK-1 from Pakistan. This nucleotide
sequence was compared with six other HCV genotype 3a full length sequences from different regions of the world
by using statistical methods of phylogenetic analysis.
Conclusion: The nucleotide difference of these seven sequences shows that HCV genotype 3a of phylogenetically
distinct origin is circulating in Pakistan.

Findings
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is leading cause of chronic liver
disease [1] with estimated 170-200 million infected persons worldwide [2] including approximately 17 million
in Pakistan [3]. It is positive single stranded RNA virus
first isolated in 1819 and is a member of Flaviviridae
[2,4]. The HCV genome is about 9.6 kb in length consisting of single open reading frame encoding a polyprotein of 3,000 amino acids and non-translated regions
located at the 5’and 3’ terminus [5].
The relative prevalence of HCV genotypes varies with
the geographic area but genotypes 1, 2 and 3 have
worldwide distribution. 1a and 1b are the most widespread genotypes in the Europe, [6] USA, [7] and Japan
[8]. HCV subtype 3a is the most common genotype circulating in India [9], Nepal [10] and Pakistan [11]. HCV
genotype 4 prevailing in the Middle East and North
Africa [12], and genotypes 5 and 6 appears to be most
common to South Africa and Hong Kong, respectively
[13]. Genetic analysis of HCV genotype 3a is very
important as it is very sensitive to interferon therapy
compared to the other genotypes.
Butt and colleagues [2] showed that HCV 3a has been
the predominant genotype (causing disease in 62% * Correspondence: idreeskhan96@yahoo.com

70% patients) in Pakistan based on the last ten years
data (2000-2009), which shows that this genotype has
been successfully spreading in Pakistan. However, it has
not been well characterized genomically. For this purpose, serum sample from patient infected with HCV
was obtained and consensus sequence of HCV genotype
3a isolate PK-1 was determined from cDNA using various modified methods [14,15]. In the present study, we
report the first full sequence of HCV isolate PK-1 (9474
nucleotides) from Pakistan. This genomic sequence is
phylogenetically distinct from the HCV genotype 3a isolates sequenced in the rest of the countries like USA,
New Zealand, Italy, Australia and Germany (Table 1).
Phylogenetic analysis of the isolate PK-1 and all the
full length HCV genotype 3a genomes (n = 7) in the
GenBank database (Table 1) by using MEGA4 software
package. Two different methods (UPGMA method and
Neighbor Joining (NJ) method) of the phylogenetic analysis were used as described previously [16]. Evolutionary distances were also estimated by using methods
previously reported by Tamura et al [16].
The full length genomic sequences of HCV 3a
reported from USA, New Zealand, Italy and Australia
were clustered together while Pakistani isolate is shown
phylogenetically distinct by 500 replicates bootstrap analysis (Figure 1). Estimates of evolutionary divergence
between the sequences (Table 1) shows that the Pakistani
isolate have evolutionary distance of 0.085-0.103 to the

rest of all the full length sequences however, the average distance between all these sequences is 0.0655 ± 0.0071 (Table
2). The analysis also suggests that PK-1 and American
isolate (D28917) are the earliest phylogenetic representatives of the HCV genotype 3a that has been successfully
spreading in Pakistan and USA respectively, while the
rest of the isolates are their late derivatives spreading in
Germany, Italy, New Zealand and Australia. As 3a is the
predominant genotype in Pakistan, its sequencing data
and evolutionary analysis will help in evaluation and
development of new antiviral therapies and possible vaccine development. Moreover, the association of HCV
genotype 3a full length nucleotide sequences with the
epidemiology, severity of disease and its response to
interferon therapy needs to be evaluated.
