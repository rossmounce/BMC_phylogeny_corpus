Do clones degenerate over time? Explaining the
genetic variability of asexuals through population
genetic models
Karel Janko1*, Pavel Drozd2, Jan Eisner3

Abstract
Background: Quest for understanding the nature of mechanisms governing the life span of clonal organisms lasts
for several decades. Phylogenetic evidence for recent origins of most clones is usually interpreted as proof that
clones suffer from gradual age-dependent fitness decay (e.g. Muller’s ratchet). However, we have shown that a
neutral drift can also qualitatively explain the observed distribution of clonal ages. This finding was followed by
several attempts to distinguish the effects of neutral and non-neutral processes. Most recently, Neiman et al. 2009
(Ann N Y Acad Sci.:1168:185-200.) reviewed the distribution of asexual lineage ages estimated from a diverse array
of taxa and concluded that neutral processes alone may not explain the observed data. Moreover, the authors
inferred that similar types of mechanisms determine maximum asexual lineage ages in all asexual taxa. In this
paper we review recent methods for distinguishing the effects of neutral and non-neutral processes and point at
methodological problems related with them.
Results and Discussion: We found that contemporary analyses based on phylogenetic data are inadequate to
provide any clear-cut answer about the nature and generality of processes affecting evolution of clones. As an
alternative approach, we demonstrate that sequence variability in asexual populations is suitable to detect agedependent selection against clonal lineages. We found that asexual taxa with relatively old clonal lineages are
characterised by progressively stronger deviations from neutrality.
Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that some type of age-dependent selection against clones is generally
operational in asexual animals, which cover a wide taxonomic range spanning from flatworms to vertebrates.
However, we also found a notable difference between the data distribution predicted by available models of
sequence evolution and those observed in empirical data. These findings point at the possibility that processes
affecting clonal evolution differ from those described in recent studies, suggesting that theoretical models of
asexual populations must evolve to address this problem in detail.

Background
There is little disagreement that strict asexuality is an
evolutionary dead-end in ‘higher’ organisms and that
most asexual metazoans only form tips of the tree of
life. Among the approximately 20 currently available
hypotheses for the persistence of sex [1], those assuming

time-dependent disadvantages of asexual reproduction
(hereafter referred to as clonal decay) are widely
accepted explanations for the apparent caducity of most
natural clones and for the dominance of sex among
Eukaryotes. Clonal decay may involve e.g. the gradual
accumulation of deleterious mutations, low evolvability
of clones, or exploitation by rapidly evolving parasites,
which may also speed up the fitness decay in conjunction with other processes [2]. Empirical proofs of such
mechanisms exist. For example, Paland and Lynch [3]
and Neiman et al. [4] demonstrated higher rates of non-

synonymous mutation accumulation in asexual strains of
Daphnia water fleas and Potamopyrgus snails compared
to their sexual counterparts. This indeed demonstrates
inefficient purifying selection associated with clonal
reproduction.
However, such results are also interpreted as evidence
that increased accumulation of deleterious mutations is
a prominent force that determines the ages of clones.
We see this interpretation as problematic because
strictly speaking, such studies document the proximate
mechanisms underlying clonal decay but do not test
whether selection really favours young clones and sexuals at the expense of ancient clones. Furthermore, such
studies do not evaluate the generality of such processes
because numerous studies failed to detect higher mutation or parasite loads in asexuals or prove comparable
evolutionary plasticity to related sexual populations
[[5-8], rev. in [9,10]]. Interestingly, Guex et al. [5] did
not find lower fitness performance in hemiclonal
lineages of water frogs at least 25 kya ancient compared
to recently derived ones. Although Guex et al. [5] discuss putative parasexual processes that explain the similar performances of young and ancient asexual genomes,
such findings may also suggest that at least in some
cases, the ages of natural clonal genomes are not determined by clonal decay.
This emphasises the relevance of questioning how our
assumptions about the consequences of asexual reproduction actually relate to real clonal lineages found in
nature: do they really suffer higher extinction rates and
shorter life spans resulting from time-dependent debilitation as predicted by theories? The answer to this question may seem obvious because available phylogenetic
data suggest that asexual lineages are short lived.
Detailed phylogeographic studies further demonstrate
the restriction of ancient clones to more climatically
stable regions where their sexual and younger asexual
competitors are absent [11,12]. This is often interpreted
as support for clonal decay and evidence suggesting that
ancient clones may not persist in competition with
young asexuals or sexual counterparts.
However, Janko et al. [13] demonstrated that such clonal distribution patterns do not deviate from neutral
expectations and may not serve as a support for the clonal decay hypothesis. They also show that old clones
disappear from an asexual population of finite size solely
because of neutral drift even when clonal decay does not
occur, provided that new clones regularly emerge from
related sexual ancestors. Such neutral clonal turnover is
analogous to the maintenance of neutral allelic variation
under mutation-drift equilibrium. Thus, neutral clonal
turnover is a special case of the clonal decay model,
which, in addition to the stochastic component of clonal
replacement, possesses a ‘selection’ component in which

the fitness of clones decreases over time, e.g. due to
deleterious mutation accumulation. From the qualitative
viewpoint, both processes (i.e. clonal turnover and
decay) predict the same patterns. Janko et al. [13] show
that clonal diversity increases as the recruitment rate of
new clones increases and that new clones replace existing ones more frequently, resulting in lower overall ages
of clones. Thus, clonal diversity should generally be
higher and clones should be less old in sympatric areas
where asexuals coexist with their sexual ancestors
because the probability of the origin of new clones is
greater in sympatric areas than in allopatric asexual
populations geographically isolated from sexual ancestors. Neutral clonal turnover also predicts that older
clones are more widespread than younger clones on
average, the same way as older alleles are more widespread than younger ones [14].
Although Janko et al. [13] show that neutral clonal
turnover and clonal decay may not be disentangled by
the qualitative comparisons of clonal distributions mentioned above, it is necessary to determine whether natural asexuals suffer from age-dependent fitness decay.
To gain a quantitative insight into whether asexual taxa
are shorter lived than sexual ones, Schwander and Crespi [15] compared terminal branch lengths in 14 published phylogenies, each comprising multiple asexual
and sexual lineages. They found that current asexual
taxa are not significantly younger than their sexual
counterparts; this contrasts with the generally assumed
role of asexuals as short-lived ‘no-hopers’. However, as a
potential caveat, the authors suggest that the definition
of a species in sexual and asexual organisms must be
equivalent in comparative studies. This may bias the
results because the authors did not use any statistical
analysis to detect which asexual lineages would be considered different species and hence be compared to sexual species (see [16]).
As an alternative approach, Neiman et al. [17] summarise the distribution of published age estimates of
various asexual taxa, including three “scandalously”
ancient asexuals (Oribatida, Bdelloida, and Darwinulidae) and draw two important conclusions. The authors
suggest that the observed cumulative frequency distribution of asexual ages (Figure 1a) implies the existence of
similar types of mechanisms determining maximum
asexual lineage ages in all taxa. Neiman et al. [17]
further show that asexual taxa with putatively high rates
of clonal recruitment are not characterised by significantly lower age estimates than those characterised by
low recruitment rates. This observation contrasts with
the predictions of clonal turnover/decay models and led
the authors to the conclusion that the ages of clones are
not affected by the stochastic component (i.e. clonal
recruitment rate) to a large extent.

Figure 1 Comparison of observed distribution with three types of theoretical distribution functions (loglinear cf. [17], lognormal and
3rd order multi-diffonential) on the left. Residual sum of squares (rss) and Akaike information criterion (AIC) is calculated for each distribution
and shown in legend. Fictive asexual with age 1.2 × 109 years is marked by asterix. Plots of residuals vs. fitted values (with trends estimated by
smoothing) for above mentioned distributions are drawn on the right panel.

The progress made by Neiman et al. [17] is important
because their approach quantitatively addresses the generality and nature of underlying processes. Moreover,
because they draw their conclusion only from the distribution of asexual taxa, they avoid possible bias due to the
comparison of sexual and asexual taxa (see above). However, there are several weak points in their approach [17],
and we suggest that their conclusions are open to alternative explanations and yet different approaches should
be adopted to test the generality of processes affecting
the distribution of clonal ages. In the following text we
address three major issues. In part 1, we statistically
revaluate the data of Neiman et al. [17] and show that
the presented data distribution is unlikely to provide any
strong conclusions regarding the universality of processes
affecting clonal life spans. We subsequently show that the
test of turnover model designed by Neiman et al. [17] is
not appropriate because it violates the assumptions of
clonal turnover model. In part 2, in order to propose an
alternative approach, we use coalescent and individualbased simulations to demonstrate that rates of neutral
clonal turnover and clonal decay mechanisms distort the
mutation frequency spectra in multi-clonal asexual populations and that such effects are quantifiable by standard
neutrality indices. In part 3, we derive several predictions
to disentangle clonal decay and confounding demographic processes and use published sequences of clonal
animals to test for deviations from neutrality. Finally, we
discuss the implications for possible future research on
the evolution of asexuality.

Results and Discussion
1) Is the distribution of asexual ages informative about
the nature and generality of underlying processes?

Neiman et al. [17] conclude that the life spans of clones
are determined by general processes operating in a wide

spectrum of studied taxa. Their conclusion is based on
the fact that published age estimates of various asexual
taxa have regular and nearly linear cumulative frequency
on a log-transformed scale (Figure 1a), with no remarkable gaps separating the ancient taxa from the rest.
However, because the authors inspected the frequency
distribution only visually, they do not specify how large
a gap in the distribution should be to reject its regularity. The low power of the visual method is obvious
when a fictive asexual taxon that may be as ancient as
sexual reproduction itself (i.e. 1.2 billion years [18]) is
plotted to a published cumulative frequency distribution
curve (Figure 1a). Such a log-scale distribution would
still appear regular, and the fictive taxon would not
appear as exceptionally old.
More importantly, the simple linear regression used by
the authors, which we assume is produced by a uniform
density distribution (UD) on a log scale, does not accurately fit the reported cumulative frequency; it results in
systematically distributed residuals (Figure 1b) as well as
relatively high residual sums of squares (Figure 1b). Other
commonly used distribution models fit the empirical data
comparably well or even better than the UD. We used R
software [19] and the method of Šizling et al. [20] to fit
two such distributions. The log-normal distribution, which
is often used as a null hypothesis in macroecology [21],
results in lower residual sums of squares (Figure 1a). An
even better fit is achieved with application of multi-diffonential distribution (Figure 1a), which is a sum of several
diffonential distributions. Because each diffonential term
captures two counteracting processes [22,23], multidiffonential distribution is used to describe distributions generated by a mix of different underlying processes. It is
notable that all three fitted distribution functions have
comparable AIC scores [24] (Figure 1a); thus, it is difficult
to decide which of them is better suited for the data.

This finding has important implications for future
comparative studies of asexual organisms, because the
age of an asexual lineage is always estimated from the
distribution of nodes on sexual-asexual phylogenies. As
pointed out by Birky and Barraclough [16], clusters of
asexual individuals and their divergence from a sexual
ancestor obey the stochastic rules of coalescence in an
initial phase of asexual ‘species’ formation. Such clusters ‘...are not comparable to ecological or sexual species...’ until they gain reciprocal monophyly from each
other or from the sexual ancestor to form ‘independent
arenas for mutation, random drift, and selection’ that
are ‘separated by long-lasting gaps with depths significantly greater than 2Ne generations’ [16]. The coalescence-driven distribution of nodes on phylogenetic
trees may dramatically differ from node distribution
generated by ‘interspecific’ processes such as the birthdeath process [25]. Therefore, estimates of clonal ages
would differ among asexual taxa even if everything else
was equal, depending on whether clones are affected
by coalescence or the birth-death process. This suggests that both processes affect the age distribution
reported by Neiman et al. [17] differently in young versus old taxa, which contrasts Neiman et al.’s conclusion about the generality of underlying process. It is
important to note that even very simple distributions
may fit the data generated by processes operating at
dramatically different rates at different parts of the
data distribution [22]. However, as stated by Preston
[22], this fact may ‘enable the insurance companies to
set their premiums without running much risk–but it
may have no physical meaning’.
Neiman et al. [17] further directly tested whether the
ages of clones are determined by the rate at which new
clones originate as predicted by the clonal turnover
model. They suggest that if Janko et al. [13] are correct,
then asexual taxa with faster rates of clonal recruitment
should be characterised by higher numbers of independent clonal origins and lower age estimates. Neiman et
al. [17] found no significant age differences between
asexual taxa with monophyletic and polyphyletic origins
of asexuality; therefore, they concluded that the model
of neutral clonal turnover does not fit the data and that
clonal ages are not determined by the stochastic component of clonal recruitment rate.
Although such quantitative evaluations of hypotheses
explaining clonal age distributions are highly required,
the test by Neiman et al. [17] is flawed. First, clonal
turnover–an analogy of the mutation-drift equilibrium
model in a finite population [26]–is only applicable to
systems (we shall refer to them as ‘asexual complexes’
hereafter) where each new clone may enter a single
arena for mutation, random drift, and selection with
other clones (following Birky and Barraclough [16]). In

Page 4 of 25

contrast, Neiman et al. [17] violated this basic assumption of the clonal turnover model and pooled into a
single analysis young asexual complexes undergoing
the creation of new clones together with profoundly
diversified asexual clades, which already meet the definition of a species and do not even have close sexual
relatives (e.g. [16]).
Furthermore, the analysis of Neiman et al. [17] is
based on a mixture of datasets produced from different
sampling approaches and methods ranging from
mtDNA sequencing to tissue grafts. We are concerned
that comparative analyses based on such a heterogeneous dataset may be strongly biased. Indeed, the ability
to detect the polyphyletic origin of clones depends not
only on true clonal diversity but also on the variability
of applied markers and the ancestral sexual population
as well as sampling design (see [27,28] for review).
Lastly, splitting asexual taxa into single vs. multiple
origins is not necessarily a good proxy for evaluating
clonal recruitment rates because comparisons of clonal
recruitment rates among unrelated asexual taxa are
complicated (see Discussion in [13]). For example,
according to the approach of Neiman et al. [17], Oribatid mites should be characterised by a higher recruitment rate of new clones, given the polyphyletic origin of
asexuality in this group, compared to asexual Ambystoma salamanders, which are monophyletic. However, it
is at the very least questionable whether several independent clonal origins inferred in the very old asexual
taxon of Oribatid mites (asexual age ca. 200 Mya; see
Table one in [17]) indicate higher origination rates than
the monophyletic origin of Ambystoma asexuals that
have a very short asexual history (25 kya). It follows that
the interpretation of distribution of asexual ages is
ambiguous, and other methods must be developed to
address the processes determining the lifespans of clonal
lineages and to rigorously test whether observed data
deviate from neutrality.
2) Detecting age-dependent selection against clones from
sequence data

It has been shown that clonal decay affects sequence
variability in a predictable manner. Higgs and Woodcock [29] demonstrate that Muller’s ratchet reduces the
co-ancestry times of asexual individuals; Gordo et al.
[30] show that it is also associated with a reduction of
genetic diversity below classical neutral expectation.
Because a whole asexual genome forms a single linkage
group, such background selection [31] is likely to produce a considerable distortion in the neutral frequency
spectrum toward an excess of rare variants in all loci
including neutral ones [30]. Therefore, it should be possible to construct a comparative analysis of published
phylogenetic data on asexual organisms and test

Janko et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:17
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/17

whether they are systematically affected by clonal decay.
The problem is that the above-mentioned studies
[29,30] only assume intraclonal variability (i.e. consider
only descendants of a single asexual founder of the
whole clonal population; see [32]), and their predictions
may not be directly applicable to data from natural sexual-asexual complexes. This is an important problem
because distinguishing independent clones is very difficult from sequence data alone (e.g. [27]).
We used two methods to address the possibility of
detecting traces of clonal turnover/decay from empirical
data on polyclonal asexual complexes. First, we combined
standard models of deleterious mutation accumulation
[30,33,34] and extended them with additional parameters
of clonal recruitment [13] together with routine population genetic models of structured populations. To do so,
we used the individual-based model outlined by Janko et
al. [13] and simulated the sequence diversity of geographically structured asexual complexes composed of
ancestral sexual populations as well as asexual populations, which are constantly fed by new clones emerging
from sexual ancestors. We assumed that each clone
enters the same evolutionary arena for selection and drift
(sensu [16]) and that equilibrium between the origination
and extinction of clones may be established. We adopted
a standardised method to model the stochastic

Page 5 of 25

accumulation of deleterious mutations [30] by assuming
that the fitness of an individual is given by the relationship (1 - s)k, where k denotes the number of deleterious
mutations and s denotes their selection coefficient. As a
second approach, we constructed a coalescent simulation
running backward in time and modelled clonal decay as a
deterministic process where the probability of the extinction of any clone is a function of age and the rate of pergeneration fitness loss is f’ (see Methods and Figure 2).
To study the effect of clonal decay on observed sequence
variability, we overlaid a fixed number of segregating
sites on resulting pedigrees and estimated values of Tajima’s D (D) [35] and Fu and Li’s D* (D*) [36]. These were
then plotted as functions of the coefficients s and f’. We
also studied the effect of demographic processes by varying the migration rates among both sexual and asexual
demes.
It is very important to keep in mind that the sequence
variability of asexual populations has two components:
polymorphisms inherited from a sexual ancestor and
mutations acquired after the formation of clones.
Although processes solely operating among asexual individuals determine the variability of the latter component, the former one may be strongly affected by the
population history of sexual ancestors. The dataset comprising solely mutations acquired after the switch to

connected to other demes by a migration rate m according to the finite linear stepping-stone model. B) A scheme of coalescent simulation
running backward time: Asexual complex is composed of one or more ancestral sexual populations (in the latter case, they are connected by
migration rate mc) and several clones with total population size Nc distributed according to a broken stick model among clones. Looking
backward in time, the clones either had a constant per generation probability P’ of being founded by a single ancestor derived from a sexual
progenitor (neutral model), or this probability raised per generation at rate [1 - (1 - f’)a’)]. Solid lines denote the branches in the genealogy,
which evolved during the asexual phase. Only those are used for the pruned dataset. Dotted lines represent the sexual phase of sequence
evolution.

of 500 individuals fed by new clones at rate c, deleterious
mutations accumulating at rate 0.5, each with a selection coefficient
s. Neutral model assumes s = 0. To demonstrate the effect of
varying U, the black square and black dot symbols indicate the
means values for U = 0.1 and U = 0.05, respectively. Selection
coefficient s = 0.5 in both cases. Coalescent simulation (lower panel)
assumed two sexual demes of a total size of Nc = 25,000 individuals
interconnected by migration rate mc and asexual population of Nc
= 25,000 individuals composed of 10 clonal lineages. Each clone
had a constant probability Pc of extinction per generation or it
increased at rate (1 - (1 - f’)a’). We sampled 5 individuals per deme/
clone. Mutations in the neutral locus accumulated at rate 10-8 in
both cases. In the coalescent simulation, data are estimated
according to mutation overlaid along the total pedigree (curves
called ‘Total’) or along the branches evolved during the asexual
phase of sequence evolution (curves called ‘Pruned’). Black colour
below or above the grey parts of bars indicates the proportions of
cases where simulated values of D, D* were lower or higher than
the 95% CI of the neutral expectation.

asexuality is designated ‘pruned’ hereafter, because it
omits ancestral polymorphisms inherited from the sexual population; the dataset comprising all polymorphisms is referred to as the ‘total’ dataset. Consequently,
we also evaluated the effect of clonal decay on both
types of datasets (see Methods).
We found that clonal decay distorts the mutation
frequency spectra towards rare haplotypes in the
pruned dataset, leading to negative values (often significant) of D and D* (Figures 3 and 4). This effect is
insensitive to demographic processes in ancestral sexual populations. Under the model of deleterious mutation accumulation, this effect was correlated with the
per-genome deleterious mutation rate U and was
strongest for intermediate values of selection coefficients (Figure 3); this is in complete agreement with
previous conclusions drawn from monoclonal

populations [30]. Under the deterministic model of
age-dependent loss of fitness (coalescent simulation),
this effect was a monotone function of f’.
In contrast, values of neutrality indices estimated from
the total dataset are strongly affected by processes in
the sexual population. Figure 3b demonstrates that the
more the sexual population is fragmented, the neutrality
indices are more positive. We noticed that as the
strength of clonal decay increases (and consequently, as

Figure 5 Box plots demonstrate the fraction of time that
simulated genealogies spend in asexual state as a function of
age-dependent selection (f’) and migration rate among sexual
demes (mc). Note that as the selection pressure increases, the
genealogies spend relatively longer time in sexual state. Note also
that lower migration rate among sexual demes cause longer
internal branches, which again result in shorter time spent in
asexual state.

the clones become shorter lived), the genealogies spend
relatively longer times in the sexual phase (Figure 5)
and the genetic footprints of processes affecting the sexual population become more prominent. Note that
when the sexual population is fragmented, the neutrality
indices tend to be more positive with increasing
strength of clonal decay (Figure 3b).
Several neutral mechanisms distort mutation frequency spectra in a way similar to clonal decay. As
shown by Janko et al. [13] and Combadao et al. [33], a
pronounced population structure and low rates of clonal
recruitment attenuate clonal decay and lead to longerlived clones. In this study, we noticed that neutrality
index values were negatively correlated with the recruitment rates of clones and migration rates among asexual
demes (Figure 4). On the other hand, population fluctuations are known to turn the neutrality indices toward
negative values [37]; hence, they may mimic the effect
of clonal decay or increased clonal turnover.
3) Testing for clonal decay in real populations
3.1 Definitions of model assumptions and predictions

Our findings suggest that if clonal turnover/decay affect
the variability of clones, their sequences should bear
traces of such processes. However, we must address several issues before attempting to detect footprints of
selection against clones.
Dataset and model choices As mentioned above, the
clonal turnover/decay model is only applicable to asexual complexes, where each new clone may potentially
replace any of the existing ones. Therefore, asexual taxa,
which are composed of distinct asexual species (sensu
Birky and Barraclough [16]) should be avoided. Our
model further assumes unidirectional transitions from
sex to asex. This assumption allows us to polarise substitutions on sexual-asexual pedigrees and to prune the
dataset in order to focus on the polymorphisms that
putatively evolved during the asexual phase only. On the
other hand, this is also potentially limiting because it
may lead to unpredictable behaviour in the case of massive asex ® sex transitions. However, our assumption
has a sound biological basis and is commonly used in
previous papers addressing the minimum number of
independent origins of asexuals (rev. in [17,38]). This
paper is based on mtDNA datasets, and many asexual
biotypes analysed here reproduce clonally, which theoretically prevents any gene flow to sexual species (e.g.
[39,40]). If males (which may mate with sexual females)
occasionally occur (e.g. [41,42]), they do not transfer
mtDNA markers. Therefore, we consider the current
model to be applicable for analysed dataset.
Pruning of sequences polymorphisms inherited from
sexual ancestors should be avoided in order to eliminate
confounding effects from the sexual population. The

Page 7 of 25

effect of such ‘noise’ would be especially strong when
variance inherited from sexual ancestors is higher than
that acquired after the transition to asexuality. To avoid
this, we propose two methods of pruning. First, we
reconstructed artificial sequences of asexuals that do not
take into account mutations that define phylogenetic
branches connecting sexual individuals. In the second
method, we eliminated all sites segregating in the sexual
ancestor from a given dataset (see Methods). Both
methods lead to very similar outcomes when analysing
real datasets (see below).
Disentangling neutral turnover, clonal decay, and
confounding demographic effects Various neutral
demographic processes may confound inferences based
on the age distribution of clones and mutation frequency spectra. Unlike in sexually transmitted genomes,
these processes may not be distinguished from selection
using the standard multi-locus approach (e.g. [43])
because of the complete linkage of whole asexual genomes. Similarly, it would be possible to distinguish
between simple clonal turnover and clonal decay if realistic estimates of relevant parameters such as the deleterious mutation rate or rate of clonal recruitment were
available. However, their estimation is very difficult if
not impossible. A clue to disentangle the processes that
dominantly affect the lifespan of clones is that the intensity of confounding population processes and clonal
turnover/decay are expected to be correlated with different traits. For example, the intensity of demographic
fluctuations depends on latitude [44], whereas the rate
of clonal turnover would positively correlate with the
sympatric occurrence of a sexual ancestor [13]. Therefore, the identification of traits that significantly explain
the distribution of empirical data may help to determine
the predominant processes that affect the genetic buildup of asexual populations.
To test for systematic trends in the distributions of
neutrality indices, we used available mtDNA sequences
of asexual complexes and prepared four types of datasets: the total sequences of sexual and asexual individuals, respectively, as well as the two types of pruned
sequences of asexual individuals (see Table 1 and Methods). We estimated the number of segregating sites (S)
and three neutrality indices, D, D*, and D/Dmin, in each
dataset. Furthermore, we evaluated the population size
estimators (Θ S , Θ π ) of sexual species from the total
number of segregating sites S and mean pairwise
sequence divergence (see Methods). Only taxa that
could be approximated by clonal turnover/decay models
were selected for the analysis (i.e. we did not include
distinct species sensu Birky and Barraclough [16], see
Methods). We propose several predictors of observed
data distribution. At appropriate places, we list the reasons justifying the choice of such predictors. Fitting

For each complex we denote the variability as number of segregating sites in the total dataset, as well as after the first and the second type of pruning,
respectively (Prun1, Prun2). Similarly, we note observed values of neutrality indices for each type of dataset. The sign $ denotes complexes with asexuals
distributed (at least) partially beyond the distribution range of sexuals. The sign # denotes complexes, where asexuals extend to higher latitudes compared to
sexual progenitors. ‘P’ denotes asexual complexes with predominant polyploid forms. The age-estimates of Poecilia formosa clonal lineages were based on the
reanalysis of original data by Loewe and Lamatsch [9]. LGM stands for estimated origin of asexuals since the Last Glacial Maximum. SAS, SAR, RP and WP denote
the different chromosomal races of Menetia lizards.

corresponding linear models test their strength and may
identify dominant processes affecting asexual genomes.
Predictor (1) clonal age: Clonal age should be a strong
predictor of observed data distribution. Our model predicts a positive correlation between clonal age and neutrality indices; this is because as the rate of clonal
turnover or the strength of Muller’s ratchet increases,
the average age of clones decreases [13], and measured
neutrality indices tend to have negative values (Figure
3). In this analysis, we used published age estimates of
clonal complexes as a predictor (Table 1). When the
authors did not indicate a single age estimate but published an interval of plausible ages, mean values were
used. Linear model (1) tests the dependence of neutrality indices on the age of asexuals.
Predictor (2) population size: Increasing the size of an
asexual population attenuates the rate at which Muller’s
ratchet clicks [1]; consequently, the values of D
approach zero [30]. Therefore, asexual organisms with
small population sizes should have lower neutrality
indices due to the faster operation of Muller’s ratchet.
Unfortunately, we found no data on census population
sizes and had to use some proxies. Bazin et al. [45]
show that small organisms have greater genetic diversity
and hence presumably larger population sizes than large
ones. They also found lower DNA diversity in

Figure 6 Genetic polymorphism of sexual species expressed as
ΘS in a function of body size (left) and the difference in ΘS
between sexual vertebrates and invertebrates (right).

vertebrates compared to invertebrates, which presumably have larger populations. In accordance with Bazin
et al. [45], we found some negative (though not significant) trends in the DNA diversity of sexual species relative to their body size; it also appears that vertebrates
are less polymorphic compared to invertebrates (Figure
6). Therefore, we used body size measurements as a
proxy for the population size of asexuals. Linear Models
(2) and (3) measure the correlation between neutrality
indices and body mass and length, respectively. We also
tested whether estimated values of neutrality indices differ between asexual vertebrates and invertebrates (Linear
Model (4)). In order to avoid the problem of substantial
variability in published estimates of body mass and
length, we pooled studied taxa into appropriate weight/
length categories (Table 1).
Predictor (3) geographical isolation from sex: According
to clonal turnover/decay models (rev. in [13], see Introduction), clones living in (partial) isolation from their sexual
ancestors are less likely to be replaced by new clones. Consequently, asexual taxa fully sympatric with sexual ancestors should be characterised by generally younger clones
and lower index values compared to parapatric/allopatric
complexes (Figure 3 and 4). We split the complexes (Table
1) into two groups on the basis of whether asexual lineages
occurred in (at least partial) isolation from the sexual progenitor. Table 1 reveals that geographical isolation from
sexual ancestors indeed affects the age composition of
clones in a predictable manner: the average age of allopatric
complexes is 1.13 Mya vs. 0.37 Mya in sympatric ones
(one-sided t-test, t = -2.011, df = 16, p = 0.03). Linear
Model (5) tests whether geographical isolation also affects
the genetic variability of asexual populations.
Predictor (4) extreme habitats and latitude: According
to Schwander and Crespi [14], the recent age of asexuals
can be explained by their tendency to occupy extreme
habitats in higher altitudes/latitudes, which are more

prone to founder-flush events than the distribution
ranges of sexual progenitors. Strong correlations exist
between latitudinal distribution and the intensity of
population oscillations; furthermore, populations of boreal animals are more genetically homogeneous than
long-term fragmented and stable populations of tropical
species (e.g. [44]). In agreement with these facts, the
values of neutrality indices measured in sexual species
(Table 1) are significantly correlated with their latitudinal distribution (D: R2 = 0.43, p = 0.008; D/Dmin: R2 =
0.34, p = 0.02, D*: R2 = 0.69, p < 0.01; Figure 7a). We
have shown that fragmentation of asexual populations
attenuates the turnover of clones [13] and drives the
neutrality indices toward positive values (Figure 4),
whereas population fluctuations tend toward the opposite. Therefore, we expect that if demographic oscillations significantly affect clonal populations, this effect
should increase with increasing latitude. Linear Model
(6) tests the correlation between observed data and the
highest latitude of complex distribution.
Predictor (5) data pruning: We predict that if data
pruning systematically affects observed index values,
then the distribution of neutrality indices would be correlated with the amount of original genetic variability
deleted during the pruning process. To address this
issue, Linear Model (7) tests for the correlations
between observed data and the ratio of the number of
segregating sites after pruning data to that before pruning (Spruned/Stotal).
Predictor (6) sample sizes: The efficiency of pruning
relies on the ability to distinguish between ‘frozen’ and
post-formational polymorphisms. This may be affected
by the fact that the closest sexual ancestor of any clone

Page 10 of 25

might have remained unsampled. Such bias should be
strong if the sexual ancestor is poorly sampled, while
good sampling should eliminate it. Linear Model (8)
tests whether the data distribution is systematically
affected by the sample size of sexual species.
Predictor (7) ploidy: Polyploidy may have significant
effect on mutation rates and efficiency of purifying
selection [46]. This may in turn affect the rate at which
fitness of clones deteriorates over time. Therefore, we
have assorted the asexual complexes into groups where
diploid or polyploid biotypes predominate (Table 1).
Linear Model (9) tests whether polyploidy has some
effect on the genetic variability of asexuals.
The series of these linear models sensu Farraway [47]
(E(D) = b0 + b1 * X; where X stands for a given explanatory variable), including the null model assuming no
dependence of data (b1 = 0), were ranked according to
their predictive power using the Akaike information
criterion with the second order bias correction term
(AICc; [48]) in the R programming platform. We also
evaluated the evidence ratio for each model [49],
which is a relative measure of how much more likely
any model from our set is compared to the null model.
We also calculated regression statistics for each model
(i.e. R2 , coefficient of determination) and tested their
significance by ANOVA. We did not construct more
complex models because of the risk of overfitting due
to the low number of available data on asexual complexes [49].
3.2 Identifying dominant processes affecting the genetic
diversity of asexuals

We observed very low R2 values (0.003 and 0.053) and
evidence ratios while analysing the total sequence variability (data not shown). Analyses based on both pruned
datasets indicate very low evidence ratios in Linear
Models (2-9), but consistently demonstrate strong negative correlations between neutrality indices and the ages
of clones (Linear Model (1); R2 = 0.36-0.60; Table 2).
The observed results allow us to draw some general
conclusions about nature of processes affecting the
genetic variability of asexuals. It is evident that both
pruned datasets bear traces of the same processes that
affect asexual gene pools. Methodological artefacts of
data pruning or inefficient sampling apparently do not
largely bias our results because Linear Models (7) and
(8) have very poor fit.
Furthermore, there are two lines of evidence suggesting that demographic history does not significantly
interfere with the examined datasets of asexuals. First, if
demographic processes play prominent roles in shaping
asexual genetic variability, we would expect a positive
correlation between neutrality indices and clonal ages
(see above for explanation), which was not the case

Part 1 relates to results based on the first method of data pruning and part two relates to the second pruning method (see the text for details). For each Linear
Model of the formula E(D) = b0 + b1 * X, we note its reference number as in the text, its final ranking, we describe its explanatory variable X, total number of
parameters (K), log Likelihood (logL), AICc, Evidence Ratio (Emin,j) expressing how much more likely is given model compared to the null model, regression
coefficient b1 and R2. * and ** in column R2 stands for significance at a = 0.05 and 0.01.

(Figure 8). Second, asexual datasets show no sensitivity
to latitude, while the diversity of their sexual ancestors
confirmed a strong effect of latitude (see above and
Figure 7). This suggests that dominant processes affecting asexuals’ variability differ from those operating in
sexual species. It is indeed possible that the population
sizes of individual clones undergo considerable fluctuations. However, our analysis accounts for not only intraclonal variability, which may be sensitive to such
population sweeps, but also for polymorphisms along
internodes joining independent clones to their common
sexual ancestor. Variability in these positions reflects
processes operating on the whole asexual population
and is not largely affected by demographic fluctuations
of individual clones.
The shape of the phylogenetic relationships among
asexual individuals may not be explained by stochastic
turnover alone, since clonal turnover predicts positive
correlations between clonal age and neutrality indices
(see above); meanwhile, we observed negative correlations (Linear Model (1); Figure 8 and Table 2). Instead,
it seems that clonal age has some deterministic effect on
the genetic build-up of asexual populations, because
older asexual complexes are characterised by stronger
deviations from neutrality than younger ones. However,
the underlying mechanism may not be approximated by
simple age-dependent fitness loss and it also differs
from the commonly assumed model of Muller’s ratchet
(e.g. [30,34]) since both such processes also predict a
positive correlation between clonal age and neutrality

indices. Furthermore, we observed that body size has no
effect, although we admit that it represents only a very
rough proxy for population size estimates.
Applied models for sequence evolution predict an
opposite trend than that observed from empirical data.
Nevertheless, there are two reasons to believe that our
approach warrants further attention. First, our analysis
identified the age of clonal complex as the most
important variable explaining observed data distribution. Indeed, just this parameter has played a central
role in the research of asexuality for decades. Second,
turnover/decay models apparently fail to explain the
genetic variability of asexual complexes, but they correctly predict geographic and age distribution patterns
of clones in qualitative (e.g. [13]) and even quantitative
ways (see the definition of the Predictor (4) in the section above). We tend to interpretation that the applied
population model pinpoints some relevant features of

of asexual complexes against the logarithm of ages in
generations. Sequences are pruned according to the first pruning
method.

clonal evolution, but it misses some important parameters. This situation is not uncommon in the history
of attempts to tractate natural systems by mathematical or statistical models. For example, very different
estimates of gene flow may result from models assuming migration-drift equilibrium [50], non-equilibrium
models evaluating the additional parameter of the
split-time between demes [51], or even models taking
into account the time-dependent decrease in migration
rates [52]. However, to some extent, all of these models provide valuable insights into the dynamics of studied populations.
3.3 Implications for further studies of the evolution of
asexuality

Our findings have several important implications. We
relaxed the assumption of monoclonality inherent in
previous studies (e.g. [30]) and demonstrated the suitability of sequence data for addressing selective forces
even in asexual complexes comprised of multiple independent clonal lineages. By simultaneously comparing
multiple taxa, we demonstrated that different processes
affect the genetic variability of asexual and sexual populations, which is a promising extension to previous studies on individual clonal complexes (e.g. [3]). The
present results also suggest some deterministic role of
clonal age on fitness. However, our study demonstrates
that a combination of routinely available population
genetic models with previously published models for
sequence evolution in asexuals [13,30,33,34] does not
adequately address all major processes operating in real
populations. This highlights the need to ameliorate the
conceptual framework for understanding the dynamics
of asexuality before any conclusive interpretations are
made. In following two paragraphs, we shall discuss
aspects that may be of interest in building more explicit
population models of secondary evolution of asexuality.
The present model is based on the assumption of
equilibrium between the recruitment and extinction of
clones. Weak (if any) signals of clonal decay observed in
some ‘younger’ complexes may result from the fact that
asexuality originated only recently in such cases and
equilibrium had not yet been reached. Janko et al. [13]
discuss a potential analogy with migration-drift equilibrium and recent analytical progress in phylogeography
and population genetics suggests that such departures
from equilibrium may be analytically or at least numerically tractable (e.g. [53,54]). The ability to discriminate
between equilibrium vs. non-equilibrium asexual complexes depends on the design of particular population
models as well as initial conditions. However, to our
knowledge, there is no consensus on how secondary
asexuality originates. For example, there may be relatively continuous influx of new clones since the first

Page 13 of 25

appearance of asexuality (as in our model); it is also
possible that they may originate in bursts (e.g. when two
hybridising species meet under some favourable change
of conditions) with little or no origins of clones between
such events. Any model dealing with a non-equilibrial
state should take the initial conditions into account.
On the other hand, if we consider studied asexual
complexes as dynamic systems with on-going clonal
turnover (see [55]), the terms ‘young’ or ‘recent’ would
refer to complexes where asexuality is in fact ‘ancient’
and clones never had a chance to substantially diverge
from sexuals. In such a case, the increasing signal of clonal decay in older complexes would suggest that some
initial time is necessary for the selection to differentiate
between ‘recent’ and ‘ancient’ clones. It is possible that
periods of stasis are followed by rather abrupt changes
in environmental conditions. A certain period of time
would then be needed for the environment to change
substantially from the conditions to which the clone was
optimally adapted at the time of its origin. Only asexual
complexes with clones old enough to ‘remember’ such a
change in conditions would be subject to this form of
selection. Such older complexes may be also characterised by stronger deviations from neutrality because
older clones would have passed through more demographic fluctuations than younger asexual complexes.
Alternatively, the increasing signal of selection in ‘older
complexes’ could be explained in terms of the theory of
mutational meltdown [56]. This theory predicts inefficient selection during the initial phase of clonal evolution as a result of low variance in the numbers of
mutations among individuals. However, there is no
existing analytical solution for polyclonal complexes. It
is also possible that epistasis plays some role and that
the detrimental effects of mutations may be widely
enhanced in older lineages, which have accumulated a
greater mutation load. Unfortunately, theoretical work
only concerns monoclonal populations and suggests that
the effect of epistasis varies according to the distribution
of mutational effects (e.g. [57] and citations therein).
Moreover, contemporary empirical data largely differ in
their estimated magnitude and even in the sign of the
epistasis (rev. in [58]).
3.4 Conclusions

Although theoretical studies stress the importance of
long-term disadvantages of asexuality for the maintenance of sex, contemporary empirical evidence for such
processes is ambiguous (see the Introduction and section 2). The importance of this paper to the discussion
about the evolution of asexuality is fivefold: a) it demonstrates the possibility to detect clonal decay from
sequence data in polyclonal populations; b) we have
found that genetic diversity of clonal organisms is under

Janko et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:17
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/17

control of different mechanisms than that of sexuals; c)
deviations from neutrality are proportional to clonal
ages in studied complexes, which corroborates the
hypothesis of long-term disadvantage of asexuality; d)
on the other hand, nearly neutral values of indices
observed in some ‘younger’ complexes point at an
under-appreciated possibility that the appearance and
vanishing of clones may obey stochastic rules of drift in
situation, where clones are not old enough to be debilitated by fitness deterioration; finally e) we have shown
that contemporary models are insufficient to fully
describe the nature of mechanisms affecting long-term
fitness of clones, suggesting the need to identify the
relevant parameters for more explicit models.

Methods
Simulation Models

In order to quantify the effect of background selection
on sequence variability in clonal complexes we conducted two kinds of simulations.
The first one was an individual-based simulation (IBS)
as described in Janko et al. [13]. Briefly, we simulated
haploid clonal population of size N, which was split into
d demes connected by migration rate m per generation
according to the finite linear stepping-stone model.
New clones were born at rate c to the first deme only.
Clonal individuals received a Poisson-distributed number (U) of new deleterious mutations per generation,
such that the fitness of an individual carrying k mutations was given by (1 - s)k [30] where s stands for selection coefficient of each mutation. In each simulation
run we recorded the pedigree of z individuals randomly
drawn from each sampled deme. A whole asexual pedigree coalesced in a single sexual node, which was also
the direct ancestor of all newly arisen clonal individuals
and the most recent common ancestor of the whole
pedigree (MRCA; Figure 2a).
In the second case (Figure 2b), we performed coalescent simulation running backward in time, which allows
simulations of much higher population sizes. We modified the original metapopulation model of Pannell [59]
assuming several demes. The first dC demes harboured
sexual population of the size NC, while the remaining LC
demes were asexual and corresponded to independent
clonal lineages. (To be more precise, each clone occupied one asexual deme, see Figure 2b). Population sizes
of all demes were distributed according to a broken
stick model and summed up to a total of N C asexual
haploid individuals. There was constant per-generation
migration rate mC connecting the sexual demes according to a standard finite-island model. We reconstructed
a coalescence history of z C *L C asexual individuals
(where z C denotes the number of samples per clone),
until the whole pedigree coalesced in a single sexual

Page 14 of 25

MRCA. Looking backward in time, the clones either had
a constant per generation probability P’ of being
founded by a single ancestor derived from a sexual progenitor (neutral model), or this probability raised per
generation at rate [1 - (1 - f’) a’ ], where a’ denotes the
age of clonal lineage and f’ is the rate of fitness loss (the
decay model). The probability of coalescence of two
asexual nodes was proportional to population size of
respective clone, until the time when the given clone
was founded and all its variability coalesced into a single
founder node, which was than considered as sexual. Any
two sexual nodes could coalesce if they co-occurred in
the same sexual deme with a probability proportional to
its population size. For each set of parameter values, we
performed 1000 independent simulation runs.
In each simulation run, we recorded the pedigree of
fixed number of individuals per deme or per clone,
respectively. The length of each branch was characterised by two numbers. First, we recorded total number
of generations elapsed between its ancestral node and
time of splitting into the daughter branches (or tip).
Second, we recorded the time that each branch spent in
an asexual state (this could be zero in case of joining
two sexual nodes). Total number of S segregating sites
was then overlaid onto each resulting pedigree of asexual individuals according to the infinite sites model as
described in Pannell [59]. In order to evaluate the effect
of genetic variability inherited from sexual ancestor, segregating sites were overlaid on branches either according
to their total length (we call it ‘total dataset’), or according to the number of generations they persisted in an
asexual state only (we call it ‘pruned dataset’). We then
calculated the values of D and D* based on the mutation
distribution in total and pruned datasets. The power of
D and D* to detect the clonal decay was evaluated for
each set of simulations as the proportions of simulated
values lying outside the upper and lower 95% bounds of
the neutral interval for given sample sizes [35,36].
Material

In order to test for the evidence of clonal decay in realworld asexuals, we focused on complexes composed of
polyphyletic assemblage of clones, each derived from one
sexual species (or two species in case of hybrid asexuals),
which may be approximated by our model of repeated
recruitment of clones. We downloaded individual mitochondrial DNA sequences from GenBank according to original publications describing 15 asexual complexes (Table
1). Due to the low sample sizes of the other clades of
Timema, we analysed only sequences from the Northern
clade of Law and Crespi [11] labelled ‘clade 4-2’). To test if
such systems are not formed by independent asexual species, we followed a “4X rule” of Birky and Barraclough [16].
Briefly, phylogenetic tree was constructed from both sexual

Janko et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:17
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/17

and asexual haplotypes to identify reciprocally monophyletic clusters. Mean pairwise sequence divergence (π)
within each cluster was calculated as an estimate of Θπ. We
finally checked whether the ratio of the sequence difference
between clusters is less than a quadruple of the largest Θπ.

complexes, where clones were only moderately divergent
from nearest sexual ancestors. The latter method relaxes
such an assumption, but it may eliminate positions,
which mutated independently in sexual and asexual
lineages. We note that both methods of pruning lead to
very similar outcomes.

Dataset preparation and pruning

We first prepared a dataset composed of entire
sequences obtained from asexuals (the Total dataset).
We also prepared a dataset composed of sequences
from sexual individuals only. Subsequently, we prepared
pruned datasets, which tend to eliminate the polymorphisms inherited from sexual ancestor. We propose
below two approaches to achieve this goal. The first one
is based on phylogenetic reconstruction, but because of
low statistical support for some nodes in reconstructed
pedigrees the second approach relies on different rationale and takes into account the distribution of polymorphic sites in the alignment:
a) We reconstructed the maximum parsimony (MP) tree
from downloaded sequences using PAUP* 4.0b10 software
[60] and mapped the transitions from sex to asexuality
using the MP criterion. We assumed that only sex ® asex
transitions are possible. We recorded only mutations
defining the relationships among asexual haplotypes and
their connections to closest sexual nodes (this eliminated
all mutations along branches characterised by sexual
reproduction). For each individual we transformed all such
mutations into binary state and overlaid on sequence of
total length identical to original publication according to
the infinite sites model. Since Cobitis gynogens stem from
reciprocal crossings, we pooled their heterospecific
mtDNA sequences into single dataset. We calculated D,
D/Dmin and D* from such data.
b) The sequences of asexuals were aligned together with
their sexual counterparts. All sites segregating in sexual
progenitors were deleted from the alignment and “sexual”
sequences were subsequently removed from the dataset.
As such, we kept only polymorphic sites not found in sexuals, minimizing the confounding effects of sequence evolution during the sexual phase. Values of D, D/Dmin and
D* were evaluated as above. In the cases of Cobitis and
Menetia asexual datasets were separated into two sets of
clonal lineages according to the source of their mtDNA
due to the large number of polymorphic sites corresponding to divergence between parental species. We did not
perform pruning of the dataset in the case of Menetia
lizards since both asexual lineages were monophyletic with
respect to their maternal sexual ancestors.
Both methods of pruning use different rationale and
have different drawbacks. The former one assumes that
all neutral mutations, which accumulated after the transition to asexual reproduction, occur according to an
infinite-sites model. This seems reasonable in most

Data analysis

DNAsp [61] was used to estimate Θ π , ΘS , Tajima’s D
and Fu and Li’s D* from the aligned datasets as well as
associated p-values by comparisons against 1000 coalescent simulations of neutral populations with the
same number of segregating sites. Since the assessment
of the heterogeneity among estimated index values
may be affected by differences in number of polymorphic sites among datasets, we adopted the
approach of Schaeffer [62] to account for possible bias.
This method calculates the ratio of Tajima’s D to its
theoretical minimum value (Dmin) where all segregating sites are singletons with respect to the rare variant.
This removes the dependence of Tajima’s D on number of samples and segregating sites. The D/Dmin
ratio will approach -1 as the rate of population expansion or selective sweep increases. All statistical analyses
related to fitting of Linear Models were performed
using R software [19].

Reviewer Report 1

Isa Schön

I have read this manuscript with great interest. By
applying models from population genetics to asexuals,
Janko et al. will most certainly bring new ammunition
into the debate on the still unsolved paradox of sex.
Their models provide further insights into the processes
that may play a prominent role for the fate of asexual
clones. It seems that there is some sort of age-dependent selection in the models and asexual systems that
were used. I find this paper highly relevant and it most
certainly deserves publication, even more so because it
is controversial. Some of its methods are very innovative
and relevant, also for future research and modelling on
this topic. There are several issues, however, which need
to be solved before it is ready to be accepted for publication. They are outlined below in different parts, following the structure of the manuscript. But I believe
that most of these will be easily solved. In general, the
manuscript would also greatly benefit from a thorough
correction of the English throughout, preferably by a
native speaker. In its current stage, it is full of

Janko et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:17
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/17

grammatical mistakes and not always comprehensible,
which is a great pity.
I. “Background” and “Does the distribution of asexual
ages identify the nature and generality of underlying
processes?”
Janko et al. criticize the paper by Neiman et al. heavily
in the first part of their manuscript. I am no expert in
statistics and can therefore not judge whether Neiman
et al. used appropriate or wrong approaches. However,
three reasons jump to my mind to explain the different
results between the two author teams.
1. I find it a legitimate approach to use both young and
old complexes as Neiman et al. did if one wants to test
the general age distribution of asexuals. I also consider
the redrawn Figure 1a in the current manuscript actually
as support for the statement of Neiman et al.. The three
ancient asexuals are still within the confidence intervals
of this curve in Figure 1a, while the simulated asexuals
fall outside of the confidence limits, at least in my view.
Therefore, the description and discussion of these results
need to be changed on pages 6 to 7.
The description of Figure 1b and the reasoning why
there is a discrepancy between the two functions is
unfortunately incomprehensible to me. I would urge the
authors to either explain this much more extensively as
any reader not being a statistic wizard will not be able
to follow this part of the manuscript or drop it altogether. Likewise, I also find it necessary to illustrate the
conclusions by Janko et al. on page 7 to 8 because readers being less familiar with statistics (as one would
expect from a journal like Biology Direct) will again not
be able to follow these discussions.
Author’s response: We have changed the Figure 1 as
well as its description in order to avoid the confusion.
We omitted confidence interval in Figure 1 to avoid misunderstanding. In fact, confidence intervals shown in original graph are used to estimate “mean response”
(estimated Y) for given X. These intervals were calculated
to show reliability of the fitted model and they cannot be
used for estimation of observed values.
However, we can agree only partially with the first
claim of Isa Schön. Indeed, to address the generality of
underlying process, it may be a good idea to pool young
and old complexes into single analysis. But as we
demonstrate in the text, this problem may not be tackled
by inspecting cumulative frequency distribution. Similar
issue was clearly demonstrated decades ago by Preston
in macroecology (please, refer to Results/Discussion, part
3.1). We applied Preston’s approach to the case of asexuals and clearly show that observed cumulative frequency may be explained by simple model (as done in
[17]) as well as equally-well (or even better) by more
complex model taking into account several processes
operating at different parts of the clonal age-spectrum.

Page 16 of 25

When the authors [17] used both young and ancient
complexes to test for predictions of clonal turnover (this
is our second critical remark), they have violated the
basic assumptions of the tested model. Therefore, we
agree that testing the general processes is possible from
the dataset as in [17], but it must be based on a model
that takes into account both ‘intraspecific’ and ‘interspecific’ processes. This was not done by Neiman et al. [17]
and this is the aspect, which we criticise.
2. It might be a good idea to shorten the part of their
manuscript where they criticize the manuscript by Neiman et al. further (p. 6 to 9) because most of the criticism can be explained by the mixed data set of Neiman
et al. including both young and old asexuals (as Janko et
al. say themselves). There might not really be a need
here to go on about details on statistical “finesse” for
the same reasons as stated above.
3. A third argument for my suggestion under point 2 is
that it becomes obvious again in this manuscript that differences in the definitions of asexual species and clones
might also be at play when regarding the different conclusions of Neiman et al. versus Janko et al. There have
been ample discussions on this elsewhere (please also
include Martens et al. 2009 on the question of asexual
clone definitions), which could be cited, so that there is
no need to elaborate too much on the rejection of the
neutral model for distribution of clonal ages here.
In conclusion for the first part, it is in my opinion sufficient to outline the reasons shortly why Janko et al. do
not follow the conclusions of Neiman et al. There is sufficient reason to go on with the new model approach
while I actually find too much repetition on page 10 of
results that are repeated again later. I therefore suggest
shortening pages 6 to 10 except for the statistics of Figure 1b, which need to be extended.
Author’s response: We have shortened the first part by
more than ¼ and we have reduced the statistical part to
few points showing how Preston’s critique is relevant to
the analysis of Neiman et al. [17]. We also shortened the
part elaborating on asexual species definition and use
the concept of a clone discussed by Martens et al. [32].
II. “Detecting the age-dependent selection against
clones from sequence data”.
I have some smaller comments on this part:
On page 11, it is not clear to me to which studies the
authors refer when mentioning their predictions?
Author’s response: Dr. Timothy Barraclough criticised
several parts of the MS, where our definitions of predictions were unclear. In the new version, we have avoided
this problem; please refer below to our reply to Dr.
Barraclough.
On page 12:
Is there only migration from sexuals to asexual demes
or also vice versa?

Janko et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:17
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/17

Author’s response: We assume only sex®asex migration. For more detail, please refer to Results/Discussion,
part 3.1, 2nd paragraph, and to our reply to A. Mushegian below.
Is your model also monoclonal?
Author’s response: Our model assumed migrationdrift equilibrium so in the case of low recruitment rate of
clones, it would eventually lead to monoclonality. Therefore, it is also applicable to monoclonal systems.
I would like to see the per-genome deleterious mutation rate U.
Author’s response: The effect of deleterious mutation
rate is now demonstrated on Figure 3a.
The statement that the age-dependent loss of fitness is
a monotonous function
of f’ is only true for certain m but not for all.
Author’s response: We are convinced that our text is
correct here: indeed, migration among sexual demes (m),
had no effect on the pruned dataset and neutrality
indices decrease monotonically with increasing f’
On page 13:
Which index values are increased (top sentence)? Are
these values of genetic neutrality?
Author’s response: Yes, we meant the neutrality
indices and we made the text clearer.
I would like to see somewhere the evidence that genealogies spend relatively longer time in structured sexual
population. This is not obvious to me from Figure 5.
Author’s response: We have modified the Figure 5 to
make this clear now. Please see the Figure 5 and its
legend.
Likewise, it would be nice to be able to see somewhere
that population structure and low rates of clonal recruitment soothe clonal decay and lead to longer internal
branches in asexual pedigrees. I consider these important results from the modeling, which should be made
more accessible to readers. The last sentence of this
part needs more explanation - again, this is an important result but it is dealt with a bit too briefly.
Author’s response: We have modified the text about
this issue to make it clearer. However, we do not include
a figure demonstrating it because it is shown in both
cited papers ([13], [33]) and we have already rather
large amount of figures. Both cited studies demonstrated
that population structuring attenuates clonal decay and
leads to longer-than-expected internal branches in genealogies (positive values of neutrality indices). Population
fluctuations do the opposite as follows from the coalescent theory (e.g. [37]). Therefore, we believe that verbal
discussion with appropriate references is adequate for
our purposes.
III. “Testing for clonal decay in real populations.”
I agree on the whole with the method of pruning
although it is probably only valuable if the variance

Page 17 of 25

inherited from sexual ancestors is higher than the neutral and deleterious mutation rates together. This should
be mentioned somewhere on page 14.
Author’s response: We agree but we have to add that
pruning of the data should always remove the ‘noise’ from
inherited polymorphisms. Of course, if such inherited
polymorphism constitutes large portion of total variability, the ‘noise’ would be more prominent. We have added
this to the text; please see Results/Discussion, part 3.1.
It is a very rough estimate indeed to use body weight
and body length as proxies for population sizes. Also
small animals can be really rare. Would it not be possible to include some real data on this? I find it hard to
believe that these are not available at all for the taxa
included. This would allow investigating the important
effects of population size in a more appropriate fashion,
I believe that the way population size was estimated, is
also the reason why there was such a bad model fit (see
below).
Author’s response: We were really unable to find any
sound data on population sizes. For more discussion
about this issue, please see below our reply to Timothy
Barraclough.
I find that predictors 3, 4 and 5 are somehow related extreme habitats are often in geographic isolation or at
different latitude, especially in patterns of geographic
parthenogenesis. I therefore suggest that the authors
add this.
Author’s response: We agree and we have modified
the text accordingly, please see Results/Discussion, part
3.1, predictor 4 as well as the Table 2.
I do not believe that the number of available data on
asexual complexes is low. It rather seems true that the
number of data fulfilling the criteria of the authors is
low - this should be clarified on page 17.
Author’s response: We have removed the sentence
about the need to use collect more data. However, we
still believe that the amount of well-studied asexual
complexes is rather low. Please note that other attempts
of meta-analytical approaches ([17], [15]) did not use
much more available datasets than we did. But we agree
that only a fraction of such datasets is suitable for our
test.
The description of R2 values for the different variables
from Table 2 needs to be corrected: R2 for D* in Pruning 1, for example, is 0.3601 and thus lies not between
0.64 and 0.43. Similarly, it is correct that data pruning
and sampling effort (models 7 &8) have a poor fit, but
so does model 9 (body length), where the fit is worse in
D/Dmin of Pruning 1 and 2 than for models 7 and 8.
Author’s response: We have corrected the text; please
see Results/Discussion, part 3.2.
I might have overlooked something, but is not clear to
me why you would expect that index values for sexual

Janko et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:17
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/17

species should significantly correlate with their latitudinal distribution (p. 18). Please provide some additional
explanation on this somewhere.
Author’s response: It follows from the fact that areas
in higher latitudes are more prone to founder-flush
events related to glacial cycles. Such events lead to negative index values. We have extended the description of
this issue; please see Results/Discussion, part 3.1., predictor 4 and part 3.2. paragraph 3.
“Conclusions”
It is very much appreciated that the authors are critical of their own modeling results (p. 19). The question
how much models reflect the real world, is a very
important one. I find the way that the asexual systems
were selected to be included in the models at the same
time a major strength and weakness of this manuscript.
I agree with the authors that mechanisms might be very
different in young, asexual systems that are still closely
related (both in time and space) to their sexual roots
and ancient asexuals. By only including one kind of
asexuals, a major weakness of the models might be
excluded and the results might be more genuine. However, on the other hand, this approach excludes older
systems with probably different mechanisms but which
are equally interesting. I would suggest that the authors
add wherever they describe and discuss their major
result, namely that age of clonal complexes seems to be
the most important variable that this is only true for the
young systems that were studied. It might be very different for ancient asexuals, mixed systems with different
species, etc.
In this respect, it would be good to add other possibilities to the future suggestions for models such as the
ones mentioned above.
Author’s response: We agree that our type of analysis
is suitable only for asexual complexes, where each new
clone enters the same arena for selection and drift with
all other clones. This may be limiting, since our analysis
does not test processes in ancient clonals. On the other
hand, Isa Schön just mentioned that mechanisms might
differ between young and old asexuals. In fact, exactly
this argument is a valid critique of previous approach by
Neiman et al. [17]. They suggested that most parsimonious explanation of observed age distribution is that
mechanisms are the same in all asexuals. We have
showed that such mechanisms are likely to differ. We
believe that we are very explicit about this in the text.
I wonder to which extent and how cyclic parthenogenesis and egg banks as they occur in Daphnia, which
was included in the analyses, could affect your general
outcome of increasing strength of age-dependent selection in older clones. This could be another idea for
future models?

Page 18 of 25

Author’s response: As far as we know, studied populations of Daphnia that are included in our analysis are
obligate parthenogens (see [65]). Therefore, it should not
affect our analysis.
When discussing selection (such as on page 21), it
would very much enrich the discussion if the authors
could include and relate to other concepts of selective
response of clones, such as e.g. the Frozen Niche concept and General Purpose Genotypes.
Author’s response: At this stage we are not sure, how
our results relate to such concepts. We indeed showed
that signs of selection become stronger in complexes with
older clones. In this sense, our analysis yields some proof
to the hypotheses of age-dependent selection against
clones. However, such selection is not inherent in Frozen
Niche or General Purpose Genotype hypotheses. Therefore, we didn’t find a simple way how to extend our discussion with regard to those concepts.
There is some contradiction - whereas it is said in the
first paragraph on page 21 that analytical solutions for
polyclonal complexes are still missing, it is said in the
conclusions that the study indicates the suitability of
sequence data to address selective forces, even in polyclonal complexes. This needs to be resolved.
Author’s response: We suggest that analytical solutions obtained by other studies of monoclonal models are
not simply applicable to polyclonal systems. On the other
hand, we cited works that analytically tractate equilibria
in metapopulations, which gives us some hope that in
the near future; such analytical tolls shall be available
even for polyclonal systems. Our study provides no analytical solution, since we used individual-based and coalescence simulations.
There are many phylogeographic data available already
from asexuals, including plants and a lot of literature on
geographic parthenogenesis; my feeling is that these
have not been included here because of the rather strict
criteria that were applied. Therefore, the call for phylogeographic studies needs to be rephrased.
Author’s response: We have rephrased it; please see
our reply to similar remark of Isa Schön above.
“Methods”
I am not certain whether finite linear stepping stone
models do fit migration patterns of the investigated
taxa. This needs to be addressed when discussing the
results. Especially in aquatic asexuals, many taxa have
dry-resistant eggs, which are distributed easily by wind
or birds and thus violate the stepping stone model.
Author’s response: Our model was not intended to
address all specific aspects of dispersal (in fact, this
would be very difficult given the broad taxonomic spectre
of studied organisms). Our aim was to study the impact
of population structure on genetic variability of asexuals.

For that purpose, it is sufficient to demonstrate that
increasing fragmentation results in higher index values.
It would be nice to see how the segregating sites were
overlaid onto each pedigree of asexuals. Maybe, this
could be shown in supplementary material?
Author’s response: We used standard approach, when
fixed number of segregating sites is overlaid onto simulated
pedigree. The number of mutations overlaid onto given
branch of the pedigree is proportional to its length. This
has been described in detail in other works, e.g. in [59].
As said above, models are only as good as the examples to which they are applied. I am aware of the reasons why the authors applied their criteria and to which
selection that led, but I still have some comments which
I feel should be discussed, especially if the results are
described as general as they are now. My comments
might indicate that the outcomes might differ if these
criteria would be taken into account:
1. polyphyletic origin, hybrids: most of this will lead to
polyploids, which are known to suffer less from the predicted accumulation of mutations and also from effects
of Muller’s ratchet. I would therefore like to know
which examples were polyploids and would like this to
either be tested or at least discussed.
Author’s response: This is inspiring remark. As suggested, we reanalysed the data and included the test of
the effect of polyploidy (please, see Results/Discussion,
part 3.1, predictor 7). This partitioning did not explain
the data to a large extent, suggesting that polyploidy
does not have significant effect on genetic variability of
neutral loci in asexuals.
2. I have some reservations about using different
sources of sequence data - the sequences were, as is
said, “mostly mitochondrial” - there are huge differences
between nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, also
regarding mutation rates. I agree that the two genomes
should be linked in asexuals but since we are dealing
with very young systems, I would like this to be considered somewhere. It might be more appropriate to only
use mtDNA data.
Author’s response: We expressed ourselves wrongly. In
fact, all data are mitochondrial. We made it clear in
this version.
3. Which method of Birky and Barraclough was used
to test for asexual species and how?
Author’s response: We have included the detailed
description to the Methods.
4. A mutation rate of 0.5 if very high - how are the
results with lower mutation rates or was this not tested?
On which bases was this mutation rate selected?
Author’s response: Actually, this mutation rate is not
unrealistic. This rate is per-genome. Rates around 1
mutation per generation are often discussed in theoretical studies on Muller’s ratchet. Gordo et al. [30] used a

Page 19 of 25

range between U = 0.01 and U = 0.1 when studying the
evolution of sex chromosome (i.e. per-chromosome mutation rate). Therefore, we consider our choice as appropriate. To address this concern, we have also simulated
different values, ranging from U = 0.05 to U = 0.5 as
shown on Figure 3.
Tables:
Some abbreviations should be explained in Table 1.
What are LGM, SAS, SAR, RP and WP?
Author’s response: We have added the explanations to
Table 1.
Figures:
I did not receive Figure 7, so I cannot check what was
described there (for example, on page 18).
Author’s response: We are sorry for this inconvenience.
The figure must have been lost during E-mail transmission since we have included it to the original message.
Once again, sorry for this.

The manuscript by Janko et al. examines the question
of the “clonal decay”, i.e., the explanation of the recent
age of asexual, clonal populations relative to their sexually reproducing relatives by invoking strong selection
against the former, resulting in a rapid purge of asexual
lineages, so that only those that have recently become
asexual are observed. The authors have put forward an
alternative explanation for these observations, based on
lineage birth-and-death model.
The first part of the study is the review of the evidence; the authors’ suggest that most of it is explained
by stochastic birth-and-death effects as well as, if not
better than, by negative selection models. They then go
on to show more of the same by simulating both processes in silico.
Finally, the authors suggest several tests to distinguish
between intense selection against clonal lineages and
their rapid turnover. It is this part that becomes confusing. If I understand the results correctly, they in effect
say that there is no evidence that exactly one of these
factors is in play, and that it is more likely that both are.
If this is indeed a conclusion, then perhaps the whole
paper should be rewritten with the emphasis on the two
hypothesis not being mutually exclusive.
One other system where clonal populations are also
thought to experience rapid lineage turnover, and where
at the same time selection can be measured more
directly, are viruses. There are no sexual populations
from which viruses are constantly derived, but I wonder
whether the authors have given any thought to this.

Janko et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:17
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/17

On p. 25, the authors assumed that only sex®asex
transitions are possible (i.e., the base observed in the
sexual species is ancestral, and the base observed in a
sister asexual clade is derived). This should not be
assumed: use an outhgroup to determine the ancestral
state, and retain only those sites at which this state can
be so determined. The results may be the same or
almost the same as with the authors’ assumption, but
there is no reason not to do it.
Author’s response:
We agree that main conclusion was a bit hidden in the
text of the first version of the paper. We changed relevant
parts of the manuscript with special care to show that:
a) neutral process (clonal turnover) is a special case
of the model with age-dependent selection against
clones (clonal decay) - please, see the Background, 4th
paragraph.
b) Both models give quantitatively similar predictions
and their parameterisation is difficult. However, relative importance of distinct parameters is expected to
correlate with different biological traits. Hence, we
performed a comparative analysis to find a trait with
highest explanatory power - please, see Results/Discussion, part 3.1.
c) The distribution of observed data notably differs
from predictions of both models, which imply some
age-dependent selection against clones and suggest
that genetic diversity of natural asexual complexes
may not be explained by neutral processes alone.
However, as one of the main messages, it suggests
that proximate mechanism of such selection is different from simple deleterious mutation accumulations,
which was used in many previous studies - please,
see the Results/Discussion, part 3.2, 4th paragraph.
We have considered a possibility to extend our model
to viruses. However, as also recognised by Arcady Mushegian, we found no clear parallel between the model of
asexual complex and viruses. This is because viruses do
not recruit from sexual population. More or less frequent
recruitment of new clones is the core of our model. Such
model therefore rather approximates mixed sexual and
asexual populations than systems, where sexuals do not
exist. This reasoning is also mentioned in Results/Discussion, part 1, 5th paragraph and part 3.1, 2nd paragraph.
Finally, we agree that incorporation of bi-directional
gene flow between asex and sex would relax one strong
assumption of our model. Indeed, it may be possible
through parsimony mapping and resulting polarisation
of mutations on the phylo tree may be different than in
our approach. However, we decided not to do this for
several reasons, which are explained in the text with
appropriate references (please, see also the Results/

Page 20 of 25

Discussion, part 3.1, 2nd paragraph). Shortly, in many
complexes (especially in the cases, where strict parthenogenesis has been experimentally demonstrated and in
case of hybrid asexuals) asex ® sex transitions are very,
very unlikely. Moreover, in other asexuals, where occasional gene flow into sexual population is mediated via
males mating with sexual females, the marker used in
this study - mtDNA - would not be affected. mtDNA
remains tightly bound to clones, once ‘frozen’ in clonal
lineage. Therefore, parsimony mapping on phylo trees
would have to assume unequal probability of transitions
in both direction and at the moment, we do not see, how
to weight it. For those reasons, we believe that the simplifying assumption of zero asex®sex transitions is justified.

E-mail: t.barraclough@imperial.ac.uk
This paper addresses the interesting question of
whether the theorized decline in fitness through time of
asexual populations (called clonal decay) can explain the
observation that most asexuals tend to have originated
recently from sexual ancestors. In a previous paper,
which forms the starting point for the present study,
Janko and colleagues made an important advance in this
field - patterns that look like the outcome of clonal
decay might in fact be explained by neutral turnover of
asexuals. The present paper falls into two parts: a discussion and critique of some other recent papers on this
issue; and an analysis combining modelling with a comparative survey of genetic signatures and possible covariates across a set of asexual taxa and their sexual
progenitors.
The discussion of previous papers is potentially useful
and critical, although in parts it assumes greater familiarity with the previous work than I have. The second
part has noble aims, and at the very general level of
linking theory with comparative population genetics is
to be strongly applauded. I agree whole-heartedly that
comparative population genetics is an extremely promising but relatively neglected avenue for study. Unfortunately, I do not think the analyses shed any real light on
the proposed questions, for the following reasons:
1) A very general point - the focus on the phenomenon of clonal decay does not seem especially helpful to
me. This term appears not to be of widespread usage in
the literature, and as defined here encapsulates two
mechanisms: both the accumulation of deleterious
mutations and the failure of asexuals to adapt quickly

Janko et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:17
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/17

enough to keep pace with changing environments. To
my mind, the use of a phenomenological definition
rather than a mechanistic one does not help in getting
to grips with the causes of observed patterns.
2) Somewhere early on it needs to be stated that the
clonal turnover model assumes unidirectional shifts
between sexuals and asexuals, otherwise there would be
no reason to expect sexuals to be ancestral at equilibrium. Even so, my intuition is that the observed pattern of recent asexuals across animals and plants would
be hard to explain solely by random but biased turnover
- what stops asexuals replacing the sexual ancestor? In
the present model, it seems to be the assumption that
sexuals and asexuals belong to separate populations/
demes that are independently limited. What is the biological basis for this assumption? Of course this is a matter for quantitative evaluation, which is the aim of this
study, but I’m left feeling that there are important
assumptions behind the model that aren’t fully explained
in the manuscript.
3) The predictions of the clonal turnover versus clonal
decay models are not clearly explained. In many parts,
predictions are stated without sufficient explanation and
without stating briefly the assumptions behind the prediction. Examples include: “this was interpreted as evidence against clonal turnover, which predicts negative
correlation between clonal diversity and age"; “allopatric
populations should possess older clones"; “predictions of
Higgs and Woodcock hold even in asexual complex of
multiple clones"; “clonal ages should be a strong predictor of observed data distribution and the correlation
should be negative”. Some of these statements might be
justified in the earlier papers, but they need to be
explained well enough in the present paper to be understandable without referring to earlier work.
4) My main problem is that I do not believe that the
proposed genetic signatures are useful tools for disentangling the forces of interest here. There are multiple
demographic and selective effects that influence the
value of signatures such as Tajima’s D. For example, a
recent selective sweep within an obligate asexual population would lead to a negative D, potentially even if
there were no significant deterioration in fitness over
time. Population expansion would have a similar effect.
This problem is acknowledged, but the proposed
approach of comparative analysis of covariates of
observed values constitutes very weak inference, in my
view, for the following reasons.
i) Even if the predictions are correct for the neutral
turnover model, it is not clear that other models
would not generate similar predictions. I imagine
that a large suite of models could predict that Tajima’s D would correlate with clone age.

Page 21 of 25

ii) The actual statistical tests rely on surrogates for
underlying values of interest. For example, prediction
2 concerns population size, but body weight is used
as a surrogate for population size. Latitudinal distribution features in predictor 4 and 5, but there are
many well-known covariates of latitude. The combined effects of large, unquantified errors in the use
of surrogates, and the possibility of other confounding factors not considered here, means these tests
offer negligible power to distinguish alternative predictions (which themselves seem to have an illdefined basis).
iii) These problems seem borne out by the results,
which contradict predictions, although the details
are hard to follow (see next point). Most covariates
yield no explanatory power, and there is no validation that they accurately reflect the underlying variables of interest. So, null results can only be
interpreted as insufficient power.
5) The presentation of results and their interpretation are very hard to follow. It is stated that a “negative correlation between neutrality indices and clonal
ages, ...was not the case (Figure 7)” but Figure 7 shows
a negative relationship. Under predictor 1, it says the
correlation should be negative, because “younger
clones should display more negative indices” - surely
this is a positive relationship. The interpretation of this
main result is even harder to follow: the result is discussed as indicating merit for the approach, even
though it is in the opposite direction to predicted.
Given all the problems concerning the likely low
power of these tests, it is impossible to draw any conclusions from this exercise.
To conclude, I believe a comparative study of signatures of selection across a suite of asexuals and their
progenitor sexuals, guided by theoretical models, is an
extremely worthwhile goal. However, the limitations of
the present study prevent any clear conclusions being
reached, in my opinion.
Author’s response:
We really appreciate that Timothy Barraclough wrote
and signed the review of our manuscript, which he does
not agree with. We have to apologise for some confusion
related to points 2, 3 and 5 of his critique.
ad 2) We agree that model assumptions should have
been described with greater detail rather than just cite
our previous work. We have extended the relevant parts
of the text. The discussion about biological relevance of
sex®asex transitions may also be found in our reply to
Arcady Mushegian.
ad 3) We have extended relevant parts of the MS by
short explanation of each model prediction and coupled
it with appropriate references.

Janko et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:17
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/17

ad 5) We wrongly wrote in the original version that
predicted correlation between clonal age and neutrality
indices is negative. We had in mind that intensity of clonal turnover/decay negatively affects the life span of
clones and drives neutrality indices into negative values.
Indeed, resulting correlation should be positive as correctly stated by Dr. Barraclough. We are sorry for this
confusion and we have corrected the text accordingly.
However, our opinion differs from that of Timothy Barraclough in other points and especially his fourth remark
requires more detailed explanation. Let us address
Timothy Barraclough’s criticism point by point:
ad 1) Indeed, the term ‘clonal decay’ is not widely used
in the literature. However, given the aim of our study, we
had to use some term for a class of mechanisms responsible for age-dependent fitness decrease of clones. The term
‘asexual decay’ is used in literature dealing with evolution of sex chromosomes (e.g. Schartl 2004. Current Opinion in genetics & development 14: 634-631). Since we
are dealing with processes summarized over individual
clones, we found ‘clonal decay’ suitable. It is simple and
was used in our previous paper as well as in [17]. We
defined it in the Introduction and hence, we hope that
its usage simplifies the text. Using alternative and longer
terms such as ‘mechanisms of long-term disadvantage of
asexuality’, or ‘age-dependent selection against clones’
would not be practical. We do not insist on keeping this
term in the text, but we found it useful.
ad 2) Timothy Barraclough is right that simple neutral
turnover of clones cannot explain the persistence of sex
in the nature. However, we never claimed it could.
Instead, it may well explain observed age-distribution of
clones, which was proven in our previous paper [13]. So
far, quite a lot of different explanations have been proposed for the persistence of sex, some implying long-term
advantages and some short-term advantages. Given that
the focus of our study is to detect the footprints of agedependent selection against clones from the genetic
variability (we do not study why sex persists), it seems
instructive to us to narrow the parameter space of
models.
We agree that our model is a simplification by assuming independent limitations of sexual and asexual populations. But most useful models are. Modelling the
interactions between sex and asex in the whole complexity should include the effects of plethora of parameters,
which would be numerically almost intractable. We are
not aware of any study that would have as ambitious
aims as to model the whole complexity of sex-asex interactions. Instead, other studies investigated just one or
few such processes (e.g. Peck et al. 1998. Nature 391:
889-892; Gordo and Charlesworth, 2000. Genetics 154:
1379-1387, Doncaster, Pound, Cox 2000. Nature
404:281-285). Moreover, our assumption has a biological

Page 22 of 25

background. Many asexual complexes are composed of
hybridising sexual species and their asexual polyploid
hybrids. Hybrid and polyploid forms are often assumed
to differ from parental diploids in many traits (e.g. Stillwell and Benfey. 1995. Aquaculture 137, 355-358). Such
difference may attenuate the competition and minimize
the niche overlap between sexual and asexual forms.
Therefore, we believe that our model, as constructed, provides novel insights and allows us to focus on the effect of
studied parameters, i.e. effect of clonal decay and turnover on the shape of genealogy of asexual individuals.
We do not suggest that there are no mechanisms counterbalancing the two-fold advantage of asexuals. To the
contrary, we are convinced that there must be some.
However, in this paper we showed that
a) previously used arguments about long-term disadvantage of asexuals are inconclusive (Introduction
and Results/Discussion, part 1);
b) sequence variability of asexuals is likely to bear
traces of selective process affecting them (Results/Discussion, part 2);
c) mechanisms underlying the age-dependent selection seem to exist but their nature differs from
assumptions of available models and it is not yet
understood (Results/Discussion, parts 3.2 and 3.3).
ad 4) Indeed, various demographic or selective processes may affect asexual pedigrees but we have taken
many of them into account explicitly. We must also
stress that such processes would affect Tajima’s D and
clonal ages in a predictable manner and our simulations show that population fragmentation and fluctuation will cause positive correlation of both such
parameters, which contrasts natural observations (this
was mentioned in the text and we put more emphasis
on it in the reviewed version, please see Results/Discussion, parts 3.1 and 3.2).
Timothy Barraclough further suggests that selective
sweeps of individual clones would cause negative values
of neutrality indices even if there were no significant
deterioration in fitness over time. We agree. However, the
sweep of any new clone at the expense of older ones
would also result in younger mean age of clones in the
whole asexual complex. Again, as predicted by our
model, we would end-up with positive correlation
between neutrality indices and clonal ages. Moreover, if
such process happens rarely, our model would not be largely sensitive to it since the pruned dataset takes into
account polymorphisms from the whole polyclonal population (see Results/Discussion, part 3.2, 3rd paragraph).
On the other hand, if sweeps of young clones happen frequently, would it still be justified to assume that ‘there
were no significant deterioration in fitness over time’?

Janko et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:17
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/17

Our predictions would only be contradicted by sweeps
of old clones at the expense of younger ones. We have to
stress that such events are not taken into account by traditional hypotheses assuming fitness deterioration of old
clones either. Therefore it does not disqualify our study,
which addresses the power of population models to study
the effects of neutral and selective processes on clonal
genealogies. We have included short discussion of this
issue into the text; please see Results/Discussion, part 3.3,
last paragraph.
ad 4i) We fully agree that some underlying mechanisms must exist to explain observed significant negative
correlation between neutrality indices and clonal age
(see Figure 8). However, such a fact does not disqualify
our study, since we are the first ones to point at this
important correlation, which help explain the nature of
underlying mechanisms. We have devoted two pages to
the discussion about this issue. In the new version of the
text, we summarize such discussion in the point 3.3. The
main message of our paper is that contemporary models
of selection against clones are insufficient to explain the
underlying mechanisms.
ad 4ii and 4iii) We do not agree in this point. As we
showed in Results/Discussion, part 3.1, linkage of whole
clonal genomes prevents standard multilocus-based tests
of selection and indirect tests are necessary. Let us also
remind that used surrogates have quite sound background:
a) Latitudinal distribution proved to have very strong
effect on sexuals, which is consistent with hypothesis
of founder-flush events (see Results/Discussion, part
3.1, predictor 4). Our study clearly shows that asexuals are under control of quite different mechanisms
than their sexual ancestors since asexual’s genetic
variability is not affected by latitude (see Results/Discussion, part 3.2.).
b) Isolation from sexual population significantly
affects the distribution of clonal ages, which agrees
with the predictions of neutral model. It is therefore
valid and useful approach to study its effect on
sequence variability (see Results/Discussion, part 3.1,
predictor 3).
c) Usage of body size as a proxy for population size
was adopted from previous literature on species with
unknown population size. We have newly added an
indication that larger sexual species (with putatively
smaller population size) tend to have lower genetic
polymorphism (although this trend was not significant; see Results/Discussion, part 3.1, predictor 2;
Figure 6). We therefore consider it as valid approach.
Moreover, we did not reject the standard model of
Muller’s Ratchet solely from fitting the body size into
the model. We only used it as supportive argument

Page 23 of 25

for our statement that standard models of clonal
decay do not explain the data well (note that Muller’s Ratchet predicts positive correlation between
neutrality indices and clonal ages, while we observed
the opposite)
In a summary: we are convinced that application of all
surrogates is justified on sound basis. Some of them significantly and predictably explain the variability of sexuals, others explain the distribution of clonal ages and
yet others have been used in agreement with previous
studies. Therefore, we may not agree with Timothy Barraclough that null results only suggest low power of the
test.
Finally, in contrast to Timothy Barraclough, we do
think that our study shed light on proposed questions.
We have clearly pointed on problematic application of
previous studies addressing the clonal decay. We have
further demonstrated that deviations from neutrality
increase with increasing age of clones and we also have
proposed how to adapt future population model to treat
this issue (please see Results/Discussion, part 3.3).
