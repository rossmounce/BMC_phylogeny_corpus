Abstract
Background: The Flaviviridae virus family includes major human and animal pathogens. The RNA
dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) plays a central role in the replication process, and thus is a
validated target for antiviral drugs. Despite the increasing structural and enzymatic characterization
of viral RdRps, detailed molecular replication mechanisms remain unclear. The hepatitis C virus
(HCV) is a major human pathogen difficult to study in cultured cells. The bovine viral diarrhea virus
(BVDV) is often used as a surrogate model to screen antiviral drugs against HCV. The structure of
BVDV RdRp has been recently published. It presents several differences relative to HCV RdRp.
These differences raise questions about the relevance of BVDV as a surrogate model, and cast
novel interest on the "GB" virus C (GBV-C). Indeed, GBV-C is genetically closer to HCV than
BVDV, and can lead to productive infection of cultured cells. There is no structural data for the
GBV-C RdRp yet.
Results: We show in this study that the GBV-C RdRp is closest to the HCV RdRp. We report a
3D model of the GBV-C RdRp, developed using sequence-to-structure threading and comparative
modeling based on the atomic coordinates of the HCV RdRp structure. Analysis of the predicted
structural features in the phylogenetic context of the RNA polymerase family allows rationalizing
most of the experimental data available. Both available structures and our model are explored to
examine the catalytic cleft, allosteric and substrate binding sites.
Conclusion: Computational methods were used to infer evolutionary relationships and to predict
the structure of a viral RNA polymerase. Docking a GTP molecule into the structure allows
defining a GTP binding pocket in the GBV-C RdRp, such as that of BVDV. The resulting model
suggests a new proposition for the mechanism of RNA synthesis, and may prove useful to design
new experiments to implement our knowledge on the initiation mechanism of RNA polymerases.

Background
The Flaviviridae virus family comprises three genera pesti-

virus, hepacivirus, and the large group of flavivirus. HCV
causes acute and chronic hepatitis that may lead to

cirrhosis and/or liver cancer. HCV is a major human pathogen, with 170 million people infected worldwide and 3
to 4 million of newly infected people each year [1].
Despite its large socio-economic impact, there is neither a
vaccine nor an efficient, side-effect free therapy against
this virus. Thus, the identification of potent drugs would
be a major public health achievement. However, convenient small-animal models or productively infected cell systems to study HCV are still lacking. Consequently,
compounds are often directly validated in HCV infected
chimpanzees, or in cultured cells infected with related,
surrogate viruses such as pestiviruses. The latter are animal
pathogens showing similarity to hepaciviruses and flaviviruses [2] in genome structure, replication strategy, and
individual gene products.
The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is an
enzyme playing a key role in the RNA replication process.
Despite the increasing number of studies on the characterization of RdRp activity and structure, the precise molecular mechanism remains unclear. The postulated RNA
replication process is a two-step mechanism. First, the initiation step of RNA synthesis begins at or near the 3' end
of the (+) RNA template by means of a primer-independent (de novo) mechanism [3]. The de novo initiation consists in the addition of a nucleotide tri-phosphate (NTP)
to the 3'-OH of the first initiating NTP. During the following so-called elongation phase, this nucleotidyl transfer

reaction is repeated with subsequent NTPs to generate the
complementary RNA product [3-6].
The structure of the RdRp of HCV (NS5B) has been determined [7,8]. It serves as reference in the uncovering of
mechanism [9,10] and as link between structure and biochemical data for RNA polymerases [11]. The HCV
polymerase shape resembles a semi-closed right hand and
is made of three subdomains: fingers, palm and thumb
(Figure 1). Computational and structural analysis of viral
RdRp sequences has identified five universal motifs (F, A,
B, C, E) located in (or close to) the palm (additional file
1). These motifs are both catalytic and structural. Fingers
are made of a β-strand subdomain (four strands β1, β2,
β4, β5 and an α-helix α1) and an α-helix rich subdomain
(seven helices αA αB, αC, αD, αE, αF, αH). The palm is
made of three stranded anti-parallel β-sheet (β3, β6, β7,
and three helices (αG, αJ, αK). The thumb is mainly made
of α-helices αN, αM, αL, αQ, αO, αP, αR) and a twostranded antiparallel β-sheet (β10, β11) forming an extra
structure called "the flap". The flap is proposed to play a
role in the initiation mechanism, allowing only ssRNA to
access the active site, and helping the correct positioning
of the first two nucleotides [8].
Based on the structure of HCV RdRp solved in complex
with NTPs [8], several GTP and NTP binding sites have
been proposed. One is located behind the thumb, in a
pocket on the surface of the structure, and has been called

the allosteric (or surface) GTP binding site. The second
one is in the catalytic cavity, where NTP can bind at various sites called P (priming), C (catalytic), and I (interrogating). Recently, the crystal structure of the RdRp of
Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) has been published
[12]. Another GTP binding site was found in the catalytic
site, distinct from the P, C, and I sites of HCV NS5B. In the
latter structure, this site corresponds to a cavity filled with
water.
BVDV and HCV polymerases share a similar fold (Figure
1), but exhibit differences in the fingers and thumb subdomains due to differences in the number of secondary
structure elements. As for the HCV polymerase, the shape
of the BVDV polymerase is a semi-closed right hand made
of fingers, palm, and thumb. Fingers are made of eleven βstrands, and twelve α-helices. The palm domain shows
great conservation with the HCV palm domain. It consists
of four strands forming a central β-sheet surrounded by
three α-helices. The thumb contains height α-helices and
five β-strands. The flap is lacking in BVDV RNA polymerase although Choi & et al [12] proposed that two βstrands with their connecting loops play the same role.
A number of structural differences in the flap and other
subdomains raise the question of the relevance of BVDV
as a surrogate model to discover HCV RNA polymerase
inhibitors. Few years ago, "GB" viruses were identified
and characterized as Flaviviridae agents leading to hepatitis [2] but not belonging to hepacivirus. Previous phylogenetic studies of GBV viruses were based on NS3 sequence
comparisons [2]. Out of the three GB viruses identified so
far, namely GBV-A, -B, and -C, two of them (GBV-A and
GBV-B) are most likely monkey viruses while GBV-C can
infect humans. HCV and GB virus genomes are organized
in a similar way [13,14]. This similarity has been extended
to the functional level with the characterization of the
polymerase activity carried out by NS5B [15,16]. GBV-C
virus allows a productive infection of cultured cells, that
makes it a relevant alternate virus to be used as a model
for HCV antiviral drug screening. In this study, we show
using a NS5B-based phylogenetic analysis that GB viruses
indeed carry the closest known RdRp to HCV in Flaviviridae. We have built a structural model for the GBV-C
polymerase, which allows comparative analysis with
HCV, and BVDV polymerase. Results presented in this
paper suggest a novel model for the initiation of RNA synthesis in Flaviviridae. Due to its phylogenetic closeness to
HCV, GBV-C might be an alternate and more relevant surrogate viral system than BVDV to HCV. Finally, the GBVC polymerase model proposed in this study might help
drug discovery and guide the characterization of the RNA
polymerization mechanism.

Results and Discussion
Sequence analysis and phylogenic distribution
To compare Flaviviridae RdRps, we have used the set of
sequences defined in VaZyMolO [17], that includes all
sequences of completely sequenced viral genomes (Table
1).

The polymerase gene product alignment is based both on
motif conservation and structural superimposition or
conservation of secondary structures. We observe a great
disparity depending on the genera of the compared
sequences. Based on the alignment, a tree was derived
(Figure 2 and additional file 1). Three major groups
appear corresponding to the respective genus. Pestiviruses
form a clear group distant from hepacivirus and flavivirus.
This latter is the largest group of the family. It may be
divided into several groups and isolated viruses reflecting
adaptation. GB viruses cluster with hepacivirus in one
group. This phylogenic distribution suggests that, in terms
of a most relevant model polymerase useful in the screening of anti-viral drugs, GBV-C is closer to HCV than BVDV.
The PSI-BLAST [18] search against non-redundant data
bases (nrdb) using the GBV-C polymerase as an input
sequence converges after one iteration and retrieves the
HCV polymerase only, with an E-value of 9510-59.
Homology modeling of the GBV-C Virus RNA Polymerase
A sequence alignment of GBV-C and HCV polymerases is
presented in Figure 3. It is based on sequence and structure comparison taking into account the prediction of secondary structure for GBV-C. In order to validate our
method to predict the secondary structure, we have first
used the HCV polymerase NS5B as a test sequence. Using
the software PREDICT PROTEIN [19], 50% of the β-sheets
and 84% of the α-helix are correctly predicted in the HCV
polymerase, and using PSI-PRED [20] we obtain 87.5% of
correctly predicted structural elements. Such prediction
results make us confident with respect to the reliability of
the GBV-C prediction. The secondary structure elements
of HCV polymerase and the structural prediction of the
GBV-C polymerase are superimposed on the sequence
alignment shown in Figure 3. The comparison between
the secondary structure elements observed in the HCV
crystal structure and the prediction made for GBV-C
polymerase (Figure 3) shows that β strands and α helices are almost perfectly superimposed, albeit small gaps
are located in few α-helices or loops. The alignment shows
32% identity and 72% similarity. Insertions and deletions
localize in loops primarily. The amino acid conservation
in the fingers and palm is close to 40% identity. Both
motifs (F, A, B, C, E) and the residues involved in the I site
(Arg 45, Lys 48, Lys 145, and Arg 151) match very well. As
in the crystal structure of the HCV polymerase where the
55 C-terminal amino acids are deleted, we did not include

the last 47 amino acids at the GBV-C polymerase C-terminus.
Both the sequence alignment and predicted secondary
structure shown in Figure 3 were used in SWISS-MODEL
(see methods) [21] to build and refine the GBV-C
polymerase model (Figure 4). Alternative models were
also generated using SCRWL [22], 3D-JIGSAW [23-25]
and MODELLER [26] and evaluated using VERIFY3D
[27]. The results are presented in the additional files 4 and
5. All models are evaluated as good by VERIFY3D [27],
and are very similar, although some differences exist in
flexible loops. Key residues of the active site are perfectly

superimposed, unlike side chains because of their flexibility (additional file 4). These similar results make us very
confident of the reliability of the GBV-C polymerase
model, and for clarity, we will focus on the model generated by SWISS-MODEL [21]. The modeled structure was
then evaluated using PROCHECK [28], "WHAT IF" [29],
and VERIFY3D [27]. Results are shown in Table 2 A/B and
additional file 5. The Ramachandran plot is correct, and
according to theses programs, scores are within expected
ranges for well-refined structures. Nevertheless, several
residues located in flexible loops fall into disallowed
regions of the Ramachandran plot (additional file 2A): Ser
100, Val 255, Thr 256 and Cys 215. The Ramachandran

Alignment of the structural template (HCV) and the sequence of GBV-C
Alignment of the structural template (HCV) and the sequence of GBV-C. Sequence alignment of the HCV polymerase and the GBV-C polymerase. Identical amino acids are boxed in red. We superimposed secondary structure elements from
the HCV polymerase in pink, the predicted structural elements of the GBV-C polymerase in blue and the secondary structure
element of our final model in black. The HCV numbering according to [7] is given in pink. The numbering in dark red corresponds to the structure elements which have been observed with a better resolution. The dots in the alignment and structural
elements (predicted or average) symbolise gaps. Green letters show universal motifs of RNA polymerases. Green arrows indicate amino acids involved in NTP binding. The green star indicates the amino acid supposed to stack the priming base. The
numbering is that of the GBV-C polymerase. Numbers in dark green indicate cysteines involved in a putative disulfide bridge in
our model. Residues forming the allosteric GTP binding site are underlined in black.

Plot statistics given by PROCHECK (additional file 2B)
shows clearly that 99% of the residues are in allowed
regions. The score corresponding to the chi-1/chi-2 angles
of all residues is within expected ranges for well-refined
structures (Table 2). The model has a normal distribution
of residue types over the inside and the outside of the protein. Again, the backbone conformation analysis gives a
score that is normal for correctly refined protein structures. The RMS Z-score given in Table 2 is expected to be
around 1.0 for a normally restrained data set, and this is

indeed observed as in the case of high-resolution X-ray
structures. In the GBV-C polymerase model, bond angles
and lengths can be considered to deviate normally from
the mean standard bond angles.
As expected with such good scores, the model of the GBVC polymerase is similar to that of HCV, and displays the
essential features of the typical RNA dependent RNA
polymerase fold (Figure 4A and 4B). However, we note
two small differences between the HCV structure and the

GBV-C model. First, Cys 283 and Cys 308 are spatially
close enough to model a disulphide bridge (Figure 3 and
additional file 3). This bond connects the fingers and the
palm, and may stabilize the protein. Second, the superimposition of the GBV-C model and the HCV structure (Figure 4C) shows little but notable differences in the palm
and thumb. The secondary structure elements are conserved in place and type, but they are shorter in the model
than in the structure. These secondary structure elements
should have similar functions, though. For example His
428 overlaps Tyr 448 of the HCV flap (Figure 4D) and
replacement of the aromatic ring of the tyrosine by the
histidine ring could play the same role during initiation
(see discussion below).
Surface analysis
We note several differences between the surface shapes
(Figure 5) of HCV RdRp and the GBV-C model. As the two
backbones are superimposed these differences are only

due to the variability of side chains. The sequence conservation reported for the GBV-C model (additional file 3)
shows that amino acids oriented toward the inner side of
the protein are conserved whereas the amino acid which
are pointing to the surface show low identity. This surface
variability may be explained by the fact that the GBV-C
polymerase form a complex with other viral proteins, as it
is the case for the HCV polymerase which interacts with
NS3 or NS5A proteins, or as observed in the case of the
poliovirus polymerase [30]. These other viral proteins
may differ in their NS5B binding domain between HCV
and GBV-C. Moreover, it has been shown that the HCV
polymerase dimerizes and can form higher order structures after oligomerization. This multimerization is
required for the HCV polymerase activity [31]. As the

site is very well conserved, and the flap is partially
obstructing this cavity. The difference appears near the
NTP tunnel (Figure 5C and 5F). In the HVC polymerase
structure, the surface is clearly positively charged whereas
in the GBV-C polymerase model the positive charge is less
apparent.
NTP-binding sites
In the HCV polymerase, the allosteric site forms a pocket
where GTP binds. Such a pocket does exist in GBV-C
despite sequence variability (Figure 3), and is located
behind the thumb subdomain. The surface analysis shows
that the pocket has a hydrophobic nature, except for the
side chains of Asp 30 and Lys 473 that may however participate in the binding of a GTP molecule (see below).

In the HCV structure, several NTP molecules can bind to
the catalytic site at P, C, and I sites. Indeed, up to 9 phos-

phate moieties can be seen in the crystal structure. Only
the nucleotide bound at the C site is well defined,
although its nucleobase is probably incorrectly located in
the absence of the RNA template [8]. Clearly, a better definition of nucleotides and template is needed to understand the RNA synthesis process. On the other hand, the
BVDV polymerase structure in complex with GTP in the
catalytic cavity suggests a role for this nucleotide in the
initiation of RNA synthesis, as proposed below.
Docking of GTP in GBV-C
The analysis of the thumb in terms of structure and
sequence comparison proved to be informative to propose an RNA synthesis initiation mechanism. Previously,
in HCV polymerase the E motif has been proposed as a
part of the site that accommodates the first NTP incorporated during initiation of RNA synthesis (P site). Motif E
is defined by the CS-18X-R signature (Figure 3 and addi-

tional file 1) [8]. In the case of BVDV, the polymerase
structure has also been solved in complex with GTP [12].
This GTP is found in a binding pocket that is mainly constituted by amino acids within motif E. Their side chains
effectively stabilize the phosphate chains of GTP with an
Arginine (Arg 529) further away in the sequence. The
NS5B sequence comparison of Flaviviridae showed that
motif E could be extended to CS-18X-[RKT]-x(8)-[RK] as a
signature sequence (Figure 6). In the BVDV polymerase
structure, the GTP molecule has been compared to a vestigial RNA molecule acting as a primer [12]. In the HCV
polymerase structure, this GTP position corresponds to a
cavity filled with water molecules. In the GBV-C model
such a pocket exists, but its shape is different. Based on the
GTP localization in the BVDV polymerase structure, we
have docked a GTP molecule in GBV-C and HCV polymerase structures to see if these pockets could accommodate
a GTP molecule in a similar manner. These three pockets
are similar regarding position and nature of the conserved
residues. This characteristic allows a perfect fitting of the
molecule into the GBV-C and HCV pockets (Figure 7). In
all cases, part of the cavity is positively charged contributing to the stabilization of the GTP-phosphate chain in the
pocket. This stabilization involves Thr 367 and Arg 371 in
GBV-C motif E and the corresponding Arg 386 and Arg
394 in HCV. The Ser 349 in GBV-C (Ser 367 for HCV) of
the CS motif forms the bottom of the cavity. In the structure and both models, the cavity is obstructed by a proline
(Pro 189 GBV-C; Pro 321 BVDV; Pro 197 HCV). However,
amino acids stabilizing the guanine base are different.
While the base is stabilized only by hydrogen bonds with
Tyr 187 in GBV-C and Tyr 195 in HCV, Thr 320 and Tyr
581 stabilize it in the case of BVDV. In GBV-C and HCV an
aromatic residue located at the extremity of the flap, His
448 in GBV-C and Tyr 448 in HCV forms the top of the
cavity stabilizing the cycle of the base (Figure 7). Although
the pocket is conserved in charged residues, the GTP position in the pocket is different. Indeed, because the GBV-C
pocket is somehow smaller than in the case of BVDV, the
GTP ribose is flipped and the phosphate chain bends to
follow the surface of the pocket (Figure 7, compare A and
B). In HCV polymerase, the cavity is larger than the GBVC pocket and therefore the binding of the GTP molecule
is closer to what is observed in the case of the BVDV
polymerase structure (Figure 7 compare B and C).
Based on our docking results, we propose that motif E is
the signature sequence of a GTP binding site in which GTP
is required to hold the initiation complex tight. In our
structural model, the GTP itself is too remote to act as a
platform for the nucleotide positioned at the P site. The
modeled GTP binding site together with the observed
position of the flap lead us to suggest a mechanism for de
novo initiation (Figure 8). We propose that once the first
reaction of initiation is achieved (Figure 8C and 8D), the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/255

initiated template enters the pocket where the motif E
GTP is located, and stacks against the guanine base (Figure
8E). This stacking induces a rearrangement of the base,
which now contacts the flap. This latter interaction
induces the opening of the flap leading to GTP release and
further major structural changes within the polymerase
(Figure 8F and 8G). The movement of the flap is supposed
to occur to open the cavity allowing the elongation of the
neo-synthesized RNA. The opening of the cavity implies
that the thumb moves. It has been already observed that
the fingers and the palm rotate as rigid body around the
axis against the thumb domain [9]. In our model, the flap
is spatially conserved suggesting that the same movement
may occur during the elongation step of the GBV-C
polymerization. Additionally, the position of the amino
acid closing the cavity of the polymerase (flap in the case
of GBV-C and HCV, or the β-sheet in the case of BVDV)
suggests that the opening movement is specific for each
virus. This movement would be best described as an opening from the top for HCV and GBV-C and, lateral for
BVDV. Recently, we have characterized the initiation steps
of RNA synthesis kinetically [32]. It is interesting to note
that our present model is in agreement with the kinetic
data showing that the N2 to N3 polymerization reaction is
strongly rate limiting, and corresponds to the first partial
opening of the flap to release GTP as proposed in Figure 8
panel F, whereas the other rate-limiting step from N4 to N6
corresponds to the other complete flap opening allowing
dsRNA to exit from the active site as proposed in panel G.

Conclusion
The recently published high-resolution three-dimensional
structure of BVDV and HCV polymerase has allowed the
structural comparison of the two polymerases. Major differences in fingers and thumb suggest that molecular
interactions during the initiation mechanism are different. BVDV has been used as a model in the study of hepaciviruses. However, phylogenic analysis shows that GBVC is more closely related to HCV than BVDV. We propose
here a reliable model of the GBV-C polymerase structure.
The model of the GBV-C polymerase is poorly defined in
loopy regions where most of the gaps have been introduced. Despite this imprecision, the very good scores of
the structural indicators make us very confident of the reliability of our model. Moreover, the model is consistent
with the known three-dimensional structure of RNA
dependent RNA polymerases, and show conservation of
all structural elements involved in polymerization (catalytic site, RNA positive channel, NTP tunnel). As expected
after the alignment and prediction study, the GBV-C
model is very close to the HCV structure, even with a
conserved allosteric GTP binding site. Based on the BVDV
polymerase/GTP complex structure, we generated a model
of a corresponding complex of GBV-C. We propose a role

polymerization process and hence presents a useful
resource for future biochemical analysis and drug
discovery.

Methods
Sequence Retrieval
The sequences related to the different kind of polymerase
were retrieved with a PSI-BLAST [18] with standard

parameters from the public available protein database
Swiss-Prot [33], Protein Data Bank (PDB) [34] and VaZyMolO [17]. For this study we have used different structures of HCV (PDB code: [1GX5, 1GX6]), and BVDV (PDB
code: [1S48, 1S49]).
Sequence alignment comparison
Alignment of representative sequences from several members of Flaviviridae were performed using CLUSTALW [35]
with the following parameter. Slow Algorithm, Identity
matrix for pairwise alignment and BLOSUM series matrix

Page 13 of 16

BMC Bioinformatics 2005, 6:255

for multiple alignments. The alignment was then carefully
analyzed and optimized with SEAVIEW [36], taking into
account the secondary structure prediction and structural
elements when existing. This alignment was cross checked
using 3DJURY [37].
The secondary structure predictions were carried out using
JPRED2 [38], PSI-PRED [20] and PREDICT-PROTEIN
Server [19]. We used PREDICT-PROTEIN with a window
of 150 amino acids in order to increase the sensitivity of
the prediction. 20 amino acids overlap with each common superimposed window. The results presented are
consensus. Sequence alignment with structural information (structure or predictions) and the comparison of the
structure one dimension of the known viral polymerases
was performed using ESPript 2.0 [39] and ENDscript 1.0
[40].
To visualize conserved region in amino acids composition
on the reference structure, we used BOBSCRIPT [41]. The
similarity scores were calculated from the CLUSTALW
[35] alignment and they are shown on this structure with
a white (low score) to red (identity) color ramp.
Phylogenetic analysis
The sampling variance of the distance values was estimated from 1000 bootstrap resamplings of the alignment
columns. The evolutionary inference was performed
according to the Neighbor-joining method. Multiple runs
were conducted with randomized sequence input order to
avoid the tree being caught in a local statistical minimum.
The tree was generated using Phylodendron (©1997
Gilbert).
Model building, refinement and evaluation
The resulting multiple sequence alignment with the consensus secondary structure prediction was used as template to generate the threading alignment. The derived
pairwise alignment serves as reference for preparing the
file for the model. SWISS-PDB VIEWER [21] was used to
generate a first threading model. The three dimensional
model of the GBV-C RdRp was constructed using the crystal structure coordinates of the HCV polymerase [8,7]
(PDB code: 1GX5, 1QUV). Main gaps appear in loops and
smaller ones in helices. This alignment and the threading
model serve as a template file for SWISS-MODEL [21]. The
non-modeled loops were manually built after scanning
the loop database. The model was then minimized with a
cut off of 10 Å with 40 cycles of steepest descent until the
gradient fell below 10 Kcal/mol and 20 cycles of conjugate
gradient. The computations were done in vacuum with
using GROMOS 96 [42,43] force field. To generate alternate models, we have used the 3D-JIGSAW [23-25] server,
SCRWL [22] and MODELLER [26]. In this latter, positions

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/255

of predicted catalytic residues and secondary structure elements were used as spatial restraints.
Surface comparison of the template and the model were
performed with GRASP [44]. The generated models were
checked using PROCHECK [] "WHAT IF" [29] and/or
VERIFY3D [27].
Docking GTP molecule in GBV-C
The 3D model of the GBV-C RNA polymerase was used as
a target for the docking of GTP. We first superimposed the
structure of BVDV RNA polymerase/GTP complex (PDB
code 1S49) with our 3D model. This step was performed
with the program Turbo-Frodo [44]. A docking study was
performed to explore the presence or absence of a GTP
binding pocket like, as it was described in the BVDV
polymerase structure. For the docking procedure, the program AUTODOCK 3.0.5 [45] was used with a grid spacing
of 0.375 Å and 40 × 40 × 40 number of points. The grid
was centered on the mass center of the GTP molecule. The
GA-LS method was adopted using the default settings.
Amber united atoms were assigned to the protein using
the program AUTODOCK TOOLS. 250 possible binding
conformations were generated. The results of AUTODOCK run were clustered using a RMSD tolerance of 1.0
Å. We considered the structure of the first cluster. To validate the use of the AUTODOCK program, the docking
study was performed on the BVDV polymerase with GTP
as a reference. This program successfully reproduced the
experimental binding conformation with acceptable rootmean-square deviation (RMSD) of atom coordinates.
Finally, the interaction models of GTP with the binding
pocket were produced using the LIGPLOT program [46].
