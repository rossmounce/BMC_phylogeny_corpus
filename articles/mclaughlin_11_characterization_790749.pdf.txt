Characterization of DXZ4 conservation in
primates implies important functional roles for
CTCF binding, array expression and tandem
repeat organization on the X chromosome
Christine R McLaughlin and Brian P Chadwick*

Abstract
Background: Comparative sequence analysis is a powerful means with which to identify functionally relevant noncoding DNA elements through conserved nucleotide sequence. The macrosatellite DXZ4 is a polymorphic,
uninterrupted, tandem array of 3-kb repeat units located exclusively on the human X chromosome. While not
obviously protein coding, its chromatin organization suggests differing roles for the array on the active and
inactive X chromosomes.
Results: In order to identify important elements within DXZ4, we explored preservation of DNA sequence and
chromatin conformation of the macrosatellite in primates. We found that DXZ4 DNA sequence conservation
beyond New World monkeys is limited to the promoter and CTCF binding site, although DXZ4 remains a GC-rich
tandem array. Investigation of chromatin organization in macaques revealed that DXZ4 in males and on the active
X chromosome is packaged into heterochromatin, whereas on the inactive X, DXZ4 was euchromatic and bound
by CTCF.
Conclusions: Collectively, these data suggest an important conserved role for DXZ4 on the X chromosome
involving expression, CTCF binding and tandem organization.

Background
Macrosatellites are a type of variable number tandem
repeat (VNTR) that primarily differ from other VNTRs
by the size of the individual repeat unit (from 2 to
>12 kb) and restriction of the array to one or two locations in the genome [1]. To date, at least eight different
macrosatellite arrays have been described in the human
genome [1-6], although several others remain largely
unexplored [1].
Among the human macrosatellites, the best characterized is D4Z4, located at the subtelomeric regions of chromosomes 4q35 [6] and 10q26 [7,8]. D4Z4 consists of a
tandem array of 3.3-kb repeat units that can cover hundreds of kilobases at these chromosomal locations [6].
D4Z4 has been a major focus for research since a link

was made between the array and facioscapulohumeral
muscular dystrophy (FSHD) [6,9], an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by progressive atrophy of
muscles in the face, shoulders and upper arms [10]. In
almost all cases, FSHD onset is associated with contraction of the array at 4q35 to ten or fewer repeat units
[6,9]. Contraction alone is not sufficient for disease onset,
as pathogenesis is linked to a reduction in the number of
D4Z4 repeat units on a defined haplotype termed
4qA161 [11]. Like other macrosatellites [1,2,5,12,13],
D4Z4 is expressed [14]. Each D4Z4 monomer in the
array contains an ORF [15] that encodes a double
homeobox protein termed DUX4 [16]. Recent data indicate that transcripts originating from the most distal
monomer are stabilized by a poly-adenylation signal
located distal to the array [14,17], a feature that is only
found on chromosomes with the 4qA161 haplotype [18].
These advances have focused attention on inappropriate

expression of DUX4 as the likely molecular basis of the
disease.
Not all macrosatellites are obviously protein coding
[5], which then begs the question of what role they fulfil
in genome biology. One such example is the X-linked
macrosatellite DXZ4. DXZ4 is a tandem array of 3-kb
repeat units located at Xq23 [3]. While several short
ORFs are present within a monomer, none have any
homology to known proteins and they therefore may
simply be a consequence of the high GC DNA sequence
content reducing the incidence of stop codons. Identification of the ORF in D4Z4 was facilitated by the presence of the homeobox motif [15,16], and further
supported by conservation of the ORF through to
rodents [19]. However, despite no clear ORF within a
DXZ4 monomer, the array does adopt intriguing chromatin states in the context of X chromosome inactivation, which is the mammalian form of dosage
compensation, a process that balances X-linked gene
expression between the sexes by shutting down most
gene expression from one of the two X chromosomes in
females [20]. Gene silencing at the chosen inactive X
chromosome (Xi) is achieved by repackaging the chromosome into facultative heterochromatin, including
CpG island DNA hypermethylation [21,22], acquisition
of covalent histone modifications associated with heterochromatin [23-26], and underrepresentation of euchromatic marks, including histone acetylation [27] and
histone H3 dimethylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me2) [23].
Whereas most chromatin on the Xi adopts this new
configuration, DXZ4 does not. CpG dinucleotides at
DXZ4 are hypomethylated [3,12] and DXZ4 nucleosomes are characterized by H3K4me2 [12,28] as well as
several other euchromatic markers [29] and the array is
bound by the multi-functional zinc finger protein
CCCTC binding factor (CTCF) [12,29]. DXZ4 at the Xi
is readily detected as a signal of H3K4me2 within the
hypo-H3K4me2 territory of the Xi at interphase [28,29],
and as a distinct signal midway down the long arm of
the chromosome at metaphase [28]. Facultative heterochromatin of the Xi is not a homogenous mass of likechromatin, but is instead composed of at least two different types that occupy reproducible alternating bands
along the Xi [30,31]. DXZ4 resides at the interface of
two such bands [28], and therefore may have some role
in organization of the Xi involving CTCF. In sharp contrast, DXZ4 CpG dinucleotides on the active X chromosome (Xa) and in males are hypermethylated [3,12] and
nucleosomes are packaged into constitutive heterochromatin characterized by histone H3 lysine-9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) [12] and binding of heterochromatin
protein 1 gamma (HP1g) [32]. Therefore, human DXZ4
adopts alternative chromatin states on the Xa and Xi
that differ from the surrounding chromosome.

Intriguingly, analysis of D4Z4 chromatin organization
in FSHD patients revealed that the contracted allele
adopted a more euchromatic organization [32,33] involving CTCF binding [34], hence resembling DXZ4 on the
Xi [35]. Therefore, these findings highlight how investigating the biology of macrosatellites in general can provide insight into the function of other macrosatellites
such as D4Z4 in the context of FSHD.
In order to further understand DXZ4, we sought to
identify conserved DNA sequence and chromatin organization for the array by investigating the macrosatellite
in other primates, and report our findings here.

Results
DXZ4 is a conserved X-linked macrosatellite repeat in Old
World and New World monkeys

Previously, DXZ4 has been assigned to the X chromosome by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in
gorilla, chimpanzee and orangutan [36], but nothing
further is known about conservation of DXZ4 outside of
the great apes. To determine if DXZ4 is sufficiently conserved in Old World monkeys, human probes for DXZ4
and the gene 70 kb proximal to the human array (PLS3)
were hybridized to male and female rhesus macaque
(Macaca mulatta) metaphase chromosomes. An intense
signal for DXZ4 was detected on a single chromosome
in the male sample and on two chromosomes in the
female samples (Figure 1a). In both cases, the DXZ4 signal partially overlapped with the PLS3 signal. Collectively, these data indicate that DXZ4 in macaque is
X-linked and its chromosomal location is conserved
adjacent to PLS3.
Next we sought to determine if DXZ4 is a polymorphic tandem array in Old World monkeys and if
DXZ4 sequence conservation was sufficiently high
enough to detect DXZ4 in New World monkeys using a
human DXZ4 probe. Agarose embedded genomic DNA
from a human sample as a hybridization control, one
female gorilla, two male macaques, two female macaques and a male and female New World monkey were
cut with XbaI and fragments separated by pulsed field
gel electrophoresis. Given that there are no recognition
sites for XbaI in human DXZ4, genomic DNA will be
cut at the first available sites proximal and distal to
DXZ4, essentially excising the array intact. Because the
copy number of DXZ4 monomers in humans varies
between individuals, hybridizing DNA fragments are
polymorphic [3]. A Southern blot of the gel was hybridized with the human probe before washing to high
stringency (0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60°C). A single
hybridizing band was detected in all male samples, and
two bands in the females, including the New World
monkeys (Figure 1b). Three conclusions can be drawn
from this result. First, DXZ4 sequence is conserved in

primates at least as far as New World monkeys. Second,
given the single male band and two female bands, this
further supports X-linkage for DXZ4 in primates.
Finally, the range of hybridizing fragments (approximately 50 to 350 kb) indicates that DXZ4 is a VNTR in
the great apes, Old World monkeys and New World
monkeys.
Comparison of the human DXZ4 DNA sequence
[GenBank: HQ659140] against the rhesus macaque genome sequence (rheMac2), did not identify a VNTR, but
instead identified various broken matches over short
intervals and the presence of a large gap in the genome
sequence, indicating that like many tandem repeat
DNAs in the various early releases of the human genome, the sequence of DXZ4 is poorly assembled in the
current build of the macaque genome. In order to
further characterize DXZ4 in Old World monkeys, we
compared the human DXZ4 sequence to entries in the
public databases using BLAST. Several green monkey
(Cercopithecus aethiops) and rhesus macaque BAC
clones were identified with matches to DXZ4 that were
then ordered and obtained. Human DXZ4 is cut once
per monomer with HindIII [3]. Digestion of the Old
World monkey BACs with HindIII revealed an over
representation of a 3-kb fragment in the BAC clones
(Figure 1c), supporting the presence of multiple DXZ4
sequences in the clones. The 3-kb HindIII band was
excised from the gel and cloned before sequencing.
Comparison of either the complete 2,950 bp green monkey sequence [GenBank: HQ906499] or the complete
2,922 bp rhesus macaque sequence [GenBank: HQ906498]
against human DXZ4 (2,994 bp) using ClustalW2 [37]
revealed 87% nucleotide identity in both cases (Table 1).
This is lower than the observed sequence divergence of
94% between the human and macaque X chromosomes
[38]. Directly comparing the two Old World monkey
DXZ4 sequences revealed 95% sequence identity.
Using the public databases, additional complete monomer sequences were extracted for chimpanzee, gorilla,
white-cheeked gibbon (Hylobates leucogenys) and a New
World monkey (Callithrix jacchus or the common marmoset) (Table 1). These sequences were then compared to

human DXZ4. As expected, the percent nucleotide identity to human DXZ4 was highest within the great apes,
lower in the lesser apes, lower still in Old World monkeys
and lowest in New World monkeys. In all cases, the
monomers were similar in size, GC content and the number of CpG dinucleotides. The DNA sequence of human
DXZ4 is unique to its location on the X chromosome,
with the exception of three internal polymorphic microsatellite sequences [3]; [GGGCC]n, [CT]n and [TAAA]n
(Figure 2). In humans, copy number of these sequences
accounts for most variation in DXZ4 between adjacent
monomers (Tremblay DC et al., in preparation). In chimpanzee, all three of the microsatellite sequences are conserved. However, in gorilla the [TAAA] repeat is replaced
by a [CAAAAAA] repeat, and by an A-rich sequence in
gibbon (Figure 2). Both Old World monkey DXZ4 monomers contained 3 copies of [GGGCC], with 19 [CT] in
rhesus macaque and 25 [CT] in the green monkey that
were interrupted by two [GT]. Neither Old World monkey
contained the [TAAA] repeat. Instead, the sequence was
replaced with a 22-bp poly-A stretch in rhesus macaque,
and 4 copies of [GAAA] in the green monkey (Figure 2).
In the New World monkey, the [GGGCC] repeat is
replaced by a [TGGGG] repeat. The [CT] repeat is still
present, but immediately adjacent to this microsatellite is
a new dinucleotide [CA] repeat. The [TAAA] repeat is
also replaced by a [CCAAA] repeat. Collectively, these
data indicate that the [TAAA] repeat is the least conserved
internal repeat in primate DXZ4, but that all primates
retain simple repeat DNA of similar base composition at
these regions (Figure 2).
Tandem repeat organization is retained in lemurs, but
sequence conservation is restricted to the promoter and
CTCF binding region of human DXZ4 in distantly related
primates

The DNA sequence of human DXZ4 was used to identify
homologous sequences from other primate entries in the
public databases. Several matches were made with
sequences from Sumatran orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus
abelii), gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), ringtailed lemur (Lemur catta), small-eared galago (Otolemur

Figure 2 Conservation of simple repeat sequences at DXZ4.
DXZ4 is represented by a right facing 3-kb monomer. Annotated on
this monomer is the region of DXZ4 that is conserved in all
primates examined (red box) as well as the location of the three
internal simple repeat sequences (blue boxes), which account for all
repetitive DNA in DXZ4. The sequence of the simple repeats in
human is given immediately below the schematic map and
beneath this the nucleotide composition in various other primates
is given. Sequences that diverge from the human sequence are
highlighted as white writing on a black background. The horizontal
lines divide great apes from the lesser apes, Old World monkeys
and New World monkeys.

garnettii) and the Philippine tarsier (Tarsius syrichta).
However, for the more distantly related primates (lemurs,
galagos and tarsiers), sequence matches were limited to a
402-bp interval of DXZ4 corresponding to the site where
the epigenetic organizer protein CTCF is bound and bidirectional promoter activity has been assigned [12]
(Figure 3a). Outside of this region, limited sequence
homology can be detected, with the exception of an additional 326 bp that shares 69% broken homology with ringtailed lemurs (data not shown). Using the most conserved
402-bp sequence from all primates, a phylogenetic tree
was assembled (Figure 3b). The resulting cladogram is
similar to one generated through investigation of mobile
element distribution in primates [39]. Interestingly,
sequence identity for this interval was higher than across
the whole monomer through New World monkeys (compare Table 1 to Figure 3b), supporting this region as the
most conserved part of DXZ4. It is important to note that
the available sequence data for DXZ4 in many of the primates shown is limited. As more sequences are released
into the public domain, it is conceivable that the phylogenetic relationship of at least the distantly related primates
may change. Nevertheless, it is clear that sequence conservation across a single DXZ4 monomer breaks down outside of the New World monkey branch of the primate tree.
The ring-tailed lemur sequence was derived from a BAC
clone (LB2-162N9) [GenBank: AC133072] within which a
170-kb continuous sequence is assembled. The first 70 kb
of this sequence aligns with the 402-bp human DXZ4
sequence 15 times (data not shown), indicating a locally
repetitive nature for this interval. Of the remaining 100 kb,

multiple extensive single copy matches are made with
unique DNA sequences found distal to human DXZ4,
indicating that the BAC clone likely contains part of the
orthologous ring-tailed lemur DXZ4 array. Comparison of
the 170-kb BAC sequence against itself confirmed the presence of a more extensive tandem repeat in the first 70 kb
than just the 402-bp sequence. Alignment of a 3-kb
sequence from within this interval against the 70-kb
sequence clearly demonstrates that the DNA has characteristics of a tandem repeat (Figure 3c). However, unlike
human DXZ4 (Tremblay DC et al., in preparation), the
sequence is not a perfect tandem array of uninterrupted
monomers of a uniform size, but consistent with other

primates (Table 1), the 3-kb sequence is characterized by
high GC content (62%).
Conserved hypo-methylation of CpG residues on the
macaque Xi

In humans, DXZ4 on the male X and Xa in females is
characterized by CpG methylation, whereas CpGs on
the Xi are hypomethylated [3,12]. To determine if this
was conserved at the macaque Xi, we prepared bisulfite
modified genomic DNA from a male and female rhesus
macaque and pig-tailed macaque primary fibroblast culture, and then proceeded to PCR amplify a 621-bp fragment spanning the region corresponding to the human
promoter and CTCF binding site (Figure 4a). PCR products were TA cloned and at least 20 independent
clones were sequenced. Consistent with humans, male
DXZ4 is extensively methylated (Figure 4b, left panels).
In contrast, female DXZ4 is hypomethylated in a little
over half of all clones (Figure 4b, right panels). The logical interpretation of these data is that, like humans,

Page 6 of 14

DXZ4 in macaque is hypomethylated on the Xi. Notably, a single CpG residue is unmethylated in all male
and female pig-tailed macaque clones (Figure 4b, bottom panels). The significance of this is unclear, although
it does contribute to the lower overall percentage
methylation observed in this species.
Conserved H3K4me2 banding on the macaque Xi

At metaphase, H3K4me2 is largely absent from the
human Xi, with the exception of the tip of Xp including
the pseudoautosomal region and DXZ4 midway down
Xq [28,29]. Comparing the human H3K4me2 banding
pattern to heterochromatin features of the Xi indicates
that the euchromatic mark resides at the distal edge of a
major band of histone H3 lysine-27 trimethylation
(H3K27me3) and macroH2A [28,30,31]. We therefore
sought to determine if the banding pattern of H3K4me2
on the macaque Xi resembled that seen in humans. In
female rhesus macaque, a single chromosome was consistently marked by bands of H3K27me3 and hypo-

a C residue at that site. The given percentage of methylation is based on the number of methylated residues within the full profile.

H3K4me2 (an example is shown in Figure 5a), features
typically characteristic of the Xi [28,30,31]. Close examination of the chromosome revealed an intense
H3K4me2 signal midway down the long arm that
resided at the distal edge of a major band of H3K27me3
(Figure 5b), and in the vicinity of DXZ4 and PLS3 FISH
signals (Figure 1a). Additional H3K4me2 signals were
observed at the tip of the p-arm, consistent with the
pseudoautosomal region, and at the distal edge of a second q-arm band of H3K27me3. H3K4me2 band locations were reproducible on the macaque Xi, consisting
predominantly of the major q-arm signal and other
weaker bands on the p and q arms (Figure 5c). A similar
pattern is observed at the human Xi (compare to Figure
5d), indicating conserved chromatin structure at these
regions.

Euchromatic markers are largely absent from the
macaque Xi with the exception of a discrete signal within
the interphase territory of the chromosome

At interphase, euchromatic markers are absent from
the human Xi with the notable exception of a signal
within the territory of the Xi [23,28,29] that is inseparable from DXZ4 [29]. Two covalent modifications of
histone H3 that are associated with transcription, H3
lysine-4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and H3 lysine-36
dimethylation (H3K36me2), as well as lysine acetylation (a general euchromatin modification) were examined in rhesus macaque. The three modifications in
male cells showed a general nuclear distribution that
was absent from the nucleoli and little to no overlap
with territories of facultative heterochromatin defined
by H3K27me3 (Figure 6, left panels). In female cells,
the nuclear distribution was like that of males with the
additional observation that the Xi (defined by
H3K27me3) lacked signals for the euchromatin markers (Figure 6, right panels). Both H3K4me3 and
H3K36me2 showed the presence of a signal within the
territory of the Xi, a feature that was occasionally seen
for the pan-acetyl lysine antibody.

In humans, H3K4me2 is a feature of DXZ4 chromatin
on the Xi as is the association of the epigenetic organizer and insulator protein CTCF [12,29]. We sought to
determine if CTCF was a feature of macaque DXZ4 Xi.
We used H3K4me2 to define the territory of the Xi and
location of the DXZ4 dot in female macaque nuclei, and
compared this to the nuclear distribution of CTCF. As
in humans, CTCF was largely absent from the Xi with
the exception of a signal that overlapped with the
H3K4me2 ‘dot’ (Figure 7a).
To confirm DXZ4 as the site of H3K4me2 and
CTCF, chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed
on chromatin prepared from male and female rhesus
macaque and pig-tailed macaque, along with the heterochromatin marker H3K9me3. Both male and female
samples showed the presence of H3K9me3, whereas
H3K4me2 and CTCF were readily detected in the
female samples from both species of macaque (Figure
7b). The logical interpretation of these data is that
DXZ4 in males and on the Xa is characterized by constitutive heterochromatin, whereas DXZ4 on the Xi is
characterized, at least in part, by a euchromatic conformation bound by CTCF, consistent with that seen
for human DXZ4 [12].

In humans, DXZ4 is expressed [12]. Transcripts are readily detected from DXZ4 packaged as constitutive

heterochromatin in male samples, as well as from the Xi
in females, although whether transcripts originate from
the heterochromatic or euchromatic portion of the Xi
array is unclear. Transcript levels are highly variable
between cells. In females DXZ4 can be detected by RNA
FISH originating from either the Xa or Xi only, or from
both chromosomes simultaneously (Tremblay DC et al.,
in preparation). We isolated total RNA from male and
female rhesus macaque fibroblasts, prepared cDNA and
performed PCR with primer sets corresponding to three
regions of macaque DXZ4 (Figure 8a). DXZ4 was readily
detected in the male and female samples. In order to
determine if DXZ4 expression levels varied significantly
between males and females, quantitative RT-PCR (qRTPCR) was performed on the cDNA. Levels of DXZ4 were
comparable in the male and female samples analyzed
(Figure 8b). In humans, most DXZ4 transcript originates
from the sense strand, whereas low levels of anti-sense
transcript can be detected originating form the Xi [12].
In order to assess DXZ4 transcript origins, strand-specific cDNA was prepared. In both the male and female
samples, transcript could only be detected originating
from the sense strand (Figure 8c), contrasting with
humans. However, it is important to note that amounts
of anti-sense DXZ4 transcript in humans are low, and
DXZ4 transcription levels vary significantly between
human samples (Tremblay DC et. al., in preparation).
Therefore, in order to conclude that macaque does not

generate anti-sense transcript, this analysis would need
to be extended to numerous other independent macaque
samples and cell types. Next we performed RNA FISH
with a DXZ4 and XIST (X inactive specific transcript)
probe to determine if expression is only from the Xa, or
if it can also originate from the Xi. Male macaque samples showed a clear signal for DXZ4 transcripts and no
XIST RNA (Figure 8d, top panels). Female macaque samples also showed clear expression of DXZ4 (Figure 8d,
bottom panels), although like males almost all transcripts
originated from the Xa with only 6% of female rhesus
macaque showing expression from the Xi and none in
female pig-tailed macaque (Figure 8e). To ensure that
this did not reflect an inability to detect DXZ4 transcripts
at the Xi, a control experiment was performed using a
probe to the pseudoautosomal MIC2 gene. MIC2 transcripts were detected at the X and Y in males and Xa and
Xi in females (Figure 8f). Therefore, while expression of
DXZ4 is conserved in macaque, the relevance of the antisense transcript is unclear.

Discussion
To identify functionally important features of DXZ4, we
investigated chromatin structure of the array in the Old
World monkey macaque, expression and retention of
tandem repeat organization, and primary DNA sequence
conservation in a variety of closely and distantly related
members of the primate lineage.

Our data indicate that DXZ4 in the great apes and in
the Old and New World monkeys is a polymorphic tandem-repeat, with array sizes comparable to those
observed in humans [3]. DNA sequence data obtained
from a BAC clone also provides evidence of tandem
arrangement for the orthologous array in ring-tailed
lemurs.
DNA sequence analysis reveals 95 to 97% sequence
identity to human DXZ4 in the great apes, 90% in the
lesser apes, 87% in Old World monkeys and 77% in
New World monkeys. All of these primates had a repeat
unit size around 3 kb, high GC content (61 to 65%) and
a high incidence of CpG (154 to 192 per monomer).
Human DXZ4 contains three internal microsatellite
repeats that are the only repeat masked portion of a
monomer. Through Old World monkeys the [GGGCC]
and [CT] repeats are conserved. The [TAAA] repeat
sequence is only conserved in chimpanzee and diverges
in the other primates. However, all of the other primates

Page 9 of 14

have a simple repeat sequence that is enriched in A
nucleotides at this location in the monomer, suggesting
that retention of A-rich repetitive DNA is important for
this region. In the common marmoset (a New World
monkey), all three repeat sequences have diverged, but
remain repetitive and retain G-rich, C-rich and A-rich
sequence composition, respectively. It is generally
accepted that DNA sequence composition influences
nucleosome positioning [40]. Close examination of predicted nucleosome occupancy [41] for human DXZ4
using the UCSC genome browser [42] shows that the
[TAAA] and [CT] repeats are strongly inhibitory of
nucleosome occupancy, whereas the [GGGCC] repeat
sequence resides at a peak of nucleosome occupancy
(data not shown), suggesting that these sequences influence the position of nucleosomes in the array. Indeed,
microarray hybridization using DNA isolated from
human chromatin immunoprecipitated with antibodies
to H3K4me2 and H3K9me3 revealed well defined peaks
of modified nucleosomes predicted to be approximately
every fourth nucleosome in DXZ4 [12], suggesting that
nucleosome distribution within the array is likely well
defined. Therefore, it is tempting to suggest that retention of base composition and location of these repeat
sequences in primate DXZ4 is necessary to assist in
maintaining nucleosome distribution and chromatin
structure within the array.
Conservation of DXZ4 DNA sequence drops off
rapidly in the lemurs, galago and tarsier branches of the
primate tree. However, sequence homology extends
across an approximately 400-bp region of DXZ4 encompassing the bidirectional promoter and binding sites for
TFIID and CTCF [12]. Unlike the chromosome 4
macrosatellites RS447 [4] and D4Z4 [6], which both
contain ORFs that are conserved through rodents [6],
DXZ4 does not obviously encode a protein. Therefore,
retention of this sequence is very significant, and suggestive of an important role for DXZ4 in primates as a
genomic element, involving CTCF binding and transcription. Preliminary analysis of this region throughout
mammals (including mouse) indicates the presence of a
tandem repeat downstream of PLS3 that shows some
homology to this 400-bp sequence, further supporting
an important role for this element on the X chromosome (BP Chadwick, unpublished data), and this is now
a major focus for our DXZ4 investigation.
Despite a lack of conserved ORFs, DXZ4 is expressed
in humans. Most DXZ4 RNA are sense transcripts originating from the Xa, although detectable anti-sense transcription is found specifically in females and therefore
likely originates from the Xi [12]. Here we find that
DXZ4 is expressed in male and female macaque,
although almost all transcription appears to originate
form the Xa and no anti-sense transcript was detected.

Therefore, expression of DXZ4 is conserved, but the significance of anti-sense transcription remains unclear.
In humans, DXZ4 in males and on the Xa in females
is packaged into constitutive heterochromatin characterized by hyper-CpG methylation [3,12], H3K9me3 [12]
and HP1g [32]. Conversely, DXZ4 on the Xi is packaged,
at least in part, into euchromatin characterized by
H3K4me2, H3K36me2, and histone acetylation, and is
hypomethylated at CpG residues and bound by CTCF
[3,12,28,29]. Both forms are expressed despite the contrasting chromatin packaging [12]. Here we show that
all of these features are conserved at DXZ4 in the Old
World monkey macaque. Furthermore, as has been
observed in humans [28,30,31], the macaque Xi is characterized by distinct reproducible bands of H3K27me3,
with the euchromatic form of DXZ4 located at the distal
edge of a major Xq H3K27me3 band. Also consistent
with the human Xi [28], additional distinct H3K4me2
signals reside at the distal edge of other H3K27me3
bands, suggesting that conservation of this arrangement
has some role in Xi chromatin organization. Therefore,
determining the DNA sequence identity of these chromatin elements is a priority.

Conclusions
These data indicate several conserved features of DXZ4
that are likely important for the organization and function of the array: repeat monomer tandem arrangement;
retention of high GC content and CpG incidence; conservation of the internal promoter sequence; conservation of
the CTCF binding site; conservation of internal simple
repeats; and array expression. Collectively, these features
likely contribute to the roles of DXZ4 packaged into constitutive heterochromatin on the Xa and euchromatin
bound by CTCF on the Xi. What function DXZ4 has in
these contexts remains unclear. However, data from this
study highlight important conserved features of DXZ4
that will assist in guiding the formulation of new hypotheses that can be tested to decipher the role of DXZ4 on
the X chromosome. Furthermore, elucidation of DXZ4
function on the Xi will likely reveal additional intriguing
parallels between the biology of DXZ4 and the contracted
form of D4Z4 in FSHD, promoting our appreciation for
these enigmatic genomic features.
Materials and methods
Cell culture

Human female telomerase immortalized retinal pigment
epithelial cells (hTERT-RPE1) were obtained from Clontech (Mountain View, CA, USA). Human male lymphoblastoid cell line GM06992 was obtained from the
Coriell Cell Repositories (Coriell Institute for Medical
Research), as were the following primate primary

Page 11 of 14

fibroblast cells: rhesus macaque (M. mulatta) AG08305
(male), and AG08312 (female); pig-tailed macaque (M.
nemistrina) AG07921 (male), and AG08452 (female);
common squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus) AG05311
(female); black-handed spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi)
AG05352 (male). Cells were maintained according to
Coriell’s recommendations. Female gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) lymphoblast cells [43] were a gift from H Willard.
Culture media (RPMI for lymphoblasts, and DMEM for
fibroblasts), fetal bovine serum and supplements were
all obtained from Invitrogen Corp (Carlsbad, CA, USA).
Metaphase chromosome preparation

In order to enrich for cells in metaphase, growth media
of rhesus macaque primary fibroblasts was supplemented
with colcemid (Invitrogen) to 25 ng/ml before returning
cells to the incubator for an additional hour. Cells were
harvested and resuspended in 37°C 75 mM KCl for 15
minutes. To this, one-sixth volume of fixative (three
parts methanol to one part acetic acid) was applied
before pelleting the cells. Cells were washed an additional
six times with fixative, pelleting cells between each wash.
Fixed cells were dropped from approximately 30 cm onto
cleaned microscope slides resting on damp paper towels
on top of a 37°C heat block. Slides were dried at room
temperature for an additional 24 hours before use.
Pulsed field gel electrophoresis, Southern blotting and
hybridization

Agarose embedded genomic DNA from primate cells
were prepared essentially as described [5].
Agarose embedded DNA was digested with XbaI (NEB,
Ipswich, MA, USA). Each plug was first equilibrated in
300 μl of 1 × digest buffer at room temperature for 20
minutes, before replacement of buffer with 100 μl of 1 ×
digest buffer containing 200 units of restriction enzyme.
Digests were performed overnight at 37°C. Plugs were
loaded onto a 1.0% agarose gel prepared using pulsed field
certified agarose (Biorad, Hercules, CA, USA) in 0.5 ×
TBE. DNA was separated at 13°C in 0.5 × TBE and conditions selected to separate 100 to 400 kb using the auto
algorithm function of the CHEF Mapper (Biorad). Markers
were loaded in the outer lanes (NEB, MidRange PFG Markers I and II). The gel was then rinsed with water before
staining with ethidium bromide (1 μg/ml) at room temperature for 30 minutes. The gel was washed twice with
water for 15 minutes each and an image captured. The gel
was then treated with 0.25 M HCl for 15 minutes before
denaturing for 30 minutes (1.5 M NaCl, 0.5 M NaOH).
DNA was transferred to Hybond-N+ (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) overnight by standard Southern blotting [44]. The membrane was rinsed with 2 × SSC before
baking at 120°C for 30 minutes.

McLaughlin and Chadwick Genome Biology 2011, 12:R37

A DXZ4 probe was prepared by PCR amplification of
regions of human DXZ4 with the following oligonucleotides: CAGGCAGAAATGAGCACCAC and TGGTGG
CGGCCATGATCTG (485 bp); ACCAGGCAAACTG
CCCAAG and TTCTGGTTTGTCAGGAAGGC (550
bp); ACCCTGTCCTTGGCAGATG and GTTGGACGTAGGCCAGGTG (491 bp); GCCTACGTCACGCAGGAAG and CCAGCGGAAAGTCCATGGG (402 bp);
CACTTGGGAGACTCCTGAAC and TGTCCCCG
AGGTTGTCTTG (485 bp); TCTCTCGCCCACTTCTACTG and GAGTCGATGGGCCTCTTAG (530 bp).
The PCR products were cleaned (Qiagen, Valencia, CA,
USA) before labeling with DIG-11-dUTP by random
priming (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). The probes were
tested for specificity and detection of the anticipated
DNA fragment size on a Southern blot of EcoRI digested
total genomic DNA.
Hybridization was performed overnight at 60°C using
Expresshyb (Clontech). Blots were washed the following
day at 60°C using two 8-minute washes in 2 × SSC,
0.1% SDS followed by one wash of 8 minutes in 0.2 ×
SSC, 0.1% SDS. The probe was detected using anti-DIGalkaline phosphatase, blocking, wash and detection buffers according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Roche). Signals were detected by exposure to photographic film (Kodak).
BAC clone analysis

Human BAC clone 2272M5 was obtained from Invitrogen. Human BAC clone RP11-268A15 was obtained
from the Children’s Hospital and Research Center at
Oakland (CHRCO), as were the following green monkey
(C. aethiops) and macaque BAC clones: macaque (M.
mulatta) BAC clones from the CHORI-250 library CH250-131A6 and CH250-345N15; green monkey BAC
clones from the CHORI-252 library - CH252-257K14,
CH252-445A22, CH252-338G16 and CH252-199I1.
Individual DXZ4 monomers from BAC clones CH250131A6 and CH252-338G16 were generated by first performing a HindIII digestion on the BAC clone DNA, gel
purifying the 3-kb fragment and cloning into calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (NEB) treated HindIII cut
pBluescript-II (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA,
USA). Inserts were sequenced on both strands using T7,
MM-F1 CCTCTTGATGGCAGTATTGC, MM-F2 C
CTGGCCAGCATAGGTCAG, MM-F3 AGAGGCGG
CAAGAGAAATGC, SP6, MM-R1 TTGTCAGGAAGGCAGGCTAG, MM-R2 ACATCGGGTTTCCGTCACAG
and MM-R3 ATCCAACTTCCACCTCAACG.
DNA and RNA FISH

For DNA FISH, probes of human BAC clones RP11268A15 and 2272M5 were labeled with Spectrum
Orange or Spectrum Green by nick translation

Page 12 of 14

according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Abbott
Molecular, Abbott Park, IL, USA), followed by ethanol
precipitation in the presence of 25 μg of human Cot-1
DNA (Invitrogen) and resuspension in 0.1 ml of Hybrisol VII (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH, USA). A 1:1 mix
of the two probes was denatured at 75°C for 4 minutes,
and repetitive sequences blocked at 37°C for 30 minutes
before being applied directly to the slide, covered with
cover glass, sealed with rubber cement and hybridized
for 16 hours at 37°C. Slides were washed at 37°C twice
in 50% formamide, 2 × SSC for 8 minutes each, then
once in 2 × SSC for 8 minutes before adding ProLong
Gold antifade containing DAPI (Invitrogen).
For RNA FISH, a direct-labeled Spectrum Green
probe of human XIST exon 1 was prepared as
described above and used with a Spectrum Red rhesus
macaque 131A6 DXZ4 3-kb subclone probe. Fibroblasts were grown directly on slides before fixing and
extracting in 4% formaldehyde, 0.1% Triton-X100 1 ×
phosphate buffered saline for 10 minutes at room temperature. Slides were washed for 2 minutes each in 1 ×
phosphate buffered saline before dehydration through
70% and 100% ethanol for 2 minutes each and then
air-drying. A 1:1 mix of the BAC and XIST probes was
denatured at 72°C for 5 minutes before placing at 37°C
for 30 to 60 minutes to block repetitive elements. The
probe was applied onto cells and sealed with a coverslip and rubber cement at 37°C for 16 hours in a
humidified chamber. Slides were washed twice at room
temperature in 50% formamide, 2 × sodium citrate
sodium chloride (SSC), followed by 3 minutes at 37°C
in 50% formamide 2 × SSC and one wash of 3 minutes
at 37°C in 2 × SSC before addition of ProLong Gold
antifade containing DAPI (Invitrogen). Control RNA
FISH used a Spectrum Red MIC2 BAC clone RP111151O1 from Invitrogen.
Bisulfite sequencing

Macaque genomic DNA was isolated from rheusus
macaque and pig-tailed macaque cells using the Blood
and Cell Culture DNA Midi-Kit (Qiagen), and bisulfite
modified DNA prepared using the EpiTect Bisulfite kit
(Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. A 621-bp fragment of DNA was PCR amplified
from bisulfite-modified DNA using the following
primer pair: forward, GGGTATTAGGTAAATTGTTTA;
reverse, CCATCCCAAAAACATAATTAAAA. PCR products were TA cloned into pDrive (Qiagen) and individual clones sequenced with M13R.

(07-274) and anti-acetyl-lysine (06-933) were all obtained
from Millipore (Billerica, MA, USA). Mouse monoclonal
anti-H3K27me3 (ab6002) was obtained from Abcam
(Cambridge, MA, USA). Secondary antibodies were
obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories
Inc. and Invitrogen (West Grove, PA, USA). Cell staining
and preparation of metaphase chromosomes was performed essentially as described [28]. Images were collected using a Zeiss Axiovert 200M fitted with an
AxioCam MRm and images managed using AxioVision
4.4 software (Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Inc.).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation

Chromatin immunoprecipitation using rhesus macaque
and pig-tailed macaque cells was performed essentially
as described [12]. Antibodies were obtained from Millipore: anti-CTCF (07-729), anti-H3K4me2 (07-030) and
anti-H3K9me3 (07-523). Rabbit serum negative control
was obtained from EMD (Gibbstown, NJ, USA). Immunoprecipitated DNA was PCR amplified using MM-F1
and MM-R1 (sequences given above).
RT-PCR, strand-specific RT-PCR and quantitative RT-PCR

Macaque total RNA was isolated from cells using the
RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Residual genomic DNA was
removed by pre-treating the RNA with DNaseI (Invitrogen) for 20 minutes at room temperature, before heat
inactivating the DNaseI at 70°C in the presence of 2.5 mM
EDTA for 15 minutes. cDNA was prepared using 1 μg of
total RNA with or without M-MLV reverse transcriptase
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
cDNA was amplified using Taq polymerase (NEB)
with the following cycle: 95°C for 2 minutes, followed
by 35 cycles of 95°C for 20 seconds, 58°C for 20 seconds, 72°C for 30 seconds. Amplification used the following primers: MM-F1 and MM-R1; MM-F2 and MMR2; MM-F3 and MM-R3 (sequences given above).
Strand-specific cDNA was prepared essentially as
described above except random hexamers were replaced
with a strand-specific primer and an additional control
was included of reverse transcriptase without primer.
Anti-sense cDNA was primed with MM-F4 (TGACCAAGAGGTCAAAGGCG), whereas sense-strand
cDNA was primed with MM-R2. cDNA was assessed
with MM-F2 and MM-R2 or MM-F4 and MM-R4
(GTTGGACGTAGGCCAGGTG).
qRT-PCR was performed in triplicate four independent times using random primed cDNA with MM-F2
and MM-R4 using DyNAmo SYBR Green qPCR (NEB)
on a CFX96 (Biorad).
