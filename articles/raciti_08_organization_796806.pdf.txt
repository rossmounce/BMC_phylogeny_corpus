Xenopus pronephros mapping reveals 8 functionally distinct domains in the Xenopus pronephros. Interestingly, no structure equivalent to

Abstract
Background: The pronephros, the simplest form of a vertebrate excretory organ, has recently
become an important model of vertebrate kidney organogenesis. Here, we elucidated the nephron
organization of the Xenopus pronephros and determined the similarities in segmentation with the
metanephros, the adult kidney of mammals.
Results: We performed large-scale gene expression mapping of terminal differentiation markers
to identify gene expression patterns that define distinct domains of the pronephric kidney. We
analyzed the expression of over 240 genes, which included members of the solute carrier, claudin,
and aquaporin gene families, as well as selected ion channels. The obtained expression patterns
were deposited in the searchable European Renal Genome Project Xenopus Gene Expression
Database. We found that 112 genes exhibited highly regionalized expression patterns that were
adequate to define the segmental organization of the pronephric nephron. Eight functionally distinct
domains were discovered that shared significant analogies in gene expression with the mammalian
metanephric nephron. We therefore propose a new nomenclature, which is in line with the
mammalian one. The Xenopus pronephric nephron is composed of four basic domains: proximal
tubule, intermediate tubule, distal tubule, and connecting tubule. Each tubule may be further
subdivided into distinct segments. Finally, we also provide compelling evidence that the expression
of key genes underlying inherited renal diseases in humans has been evolutionarily conserved down
to the level of the pronephric kidney.
Conclusion: The present study validates the Xenopus pronephros as a genuine model that may be
used to elucidate the molecular basis of nephron segmentation and human renal disease.

Background

The kidney plays a pivotal role in fluid filtration, absorption
and excretion of solutes, and in maintaining chemical homeostasis of blood plasma and intercellular fluids. Its primary
architectural unit is the nephron, which is a complex structure composed of at least 12 segments that differ in both cellular anatomy and function [1-3]. Each nephron segment is
composed of one or more highly specialized cell types that
exhibit different patterns of gene expression and, in some
cases, even have different embryological origins [4]. In
humans, there are about 1 million nephrons per kidney [5].
Each nephron is composed of a filtering component (the renal
corpuscle) and a tubule (the renal tubule). Along the tubular
portion of the mammalian nephron, four main compartments
have been identified: proximal tubule, intermediate tubule,
distal tubule, and collecting duct. These four structures can be
further subdivided into separate segments based on histological criteria [2,3]. Each nephron segment fulfills distinct
physiological functions. The proximal tubules, for instance,
return much of the filtrate to the blood circulation in the peritubular capillaries by actively transporting small molecules
from the tubular lumen across renal epithelia to the interstitial space, whereas the collecting duct system plays a major
role in regulating acid-base balance and urine volume [6,7].
Segmentation of the developing nephron is a crucial step for
successful kidney organogenesis. Much of our knowledge of
kidney development is focused on the initial stages of kidney
formation, where we have gained major insights into the transcription factors and signaling pathways that regulate the
induction of nephrogenesis [8,9]. In contrast, little is known
about how distinct segments arise along the proximodistal
axis of the nascent nephron. Vertebrate kidneys are derived
from the intermediate mesoderm in a process that involves
inductive interactions, mesenchyme-to-epithelium transitions, and branching morphogenesis to generate the number
of nephrons appropriate for the kidney type [4,10]. Three different kidney forms - the pronephros, the mesonephros, and
the metanephros - arise sequentially during vertebrate
embryogenesis. Although each kidney form differs in overall
organization and complexity, they all have the nephron as
their basic structural and functional unit. The pronephros is
the embryonic kidney of fish and amphibians, in which its
function is essential for the survival of the larvae [11]. Because
of its anatomical simplicity, the pronephros has recently
emerged as an attractive model in which to study human kidney development and disease [12,13].
In Xenopus, the pronephric kidneys form as bilateral excretory organs consisting of single nephrons [14,15]. From a
structural point of view, the pronephric kidney was thought to
be composed of three basic components [14,15]: the glomerulus (or glomus), which is the site of blood filtration; the
tubules, where reabsorption of solutes occurs; and the duct,
which conveys the resulting urine to the cloaca. Evidence for
a more complex nephron organization of the amphibian

pronephros was provided by ultrastructural studies [16], and
at the molecular level by the regionalized expression of solute
transporters and ion channels along the proximodistal axis
[17-21]. Based on the expression domains of nine transporter
genes, a more refined model of the pronephros consisting of
distinct domains and subdomains within the tubules and duct
was proposed [19]. To date, however, a comprehensive model
of pronephric nephron organization remains elusive. Furthermore, the functional correspondence of the pronephric
subdomains to the nephron segments of the mammalian
metanephric kidney is poorly understood. We recently proposed a novel model of the Xenopus pronephric kidney,
which served as a basis for dissecting the roles of irx genes in
nephron segmentation [22]. In the present study we provide
complete molecular evidence supporting our model of the
segmental organization of the pronephric nephron, we define
the physiological functions associated with each nephron segment, and we reveal the extensive analogies with the mammalian metanephric nephron.
Large-scale gene expression analysis by whole-mount in situ
hybridization in Xenopus embryos has been used successfully
in the past to identify new molecular markers and has provided novel insights into the molecular anatomy of embryonic
patterning and regionalization [23,24]. Here, we performed a
large-scale gene expression screen of the developing pronephros with more than 240 genes encoding terminal differentiation markers to identify previously unappreciated
compartments of the mature pronephric kidney in Xenopus.
Our primary focus was on studying the expression of solute
carrier (slc) gene family members, which represent - with
more than 350 genes - a large portion of the transporterrelated genes found in vertebrate genomes [25]. In the mammalian kidney, cohorts of slc gene family members are
expressed in a segmental manner along the nephron [26].
In the present work, we report the identification of well over
100 slc genes with highly regionalized pronephros-specific
gene expression patterns in Xenopus, suggesting an unprecedented complexity of physiological activities. The obtained
gene expression data were organized in an interactive gene
expression atlas, which is housed at the European Renal
Genome Project (EuReGene) Xenopus Gene Expression
Database (XGEbase) [27]. Systematic mapping of the gene
expression domains revealed the existence of eight molecularly defined segments of the pronephric kidney that are
arranged in four distinct tubules along the proximodistal axis
of the nephron. By comparative gene expression analysis, we
demonstrate remarkable analogies between the tubules of the
pronephric and metanephric kidneys. On this basis, we propose a novel model of pronephric kidney organization that
emphasizes similarities with the mammalian nephron and
uses related nomenclature. Furthermore, we show that genes
implicated in human familial renal diseases such as Bartter's
syndrome, Gitelman's syndrome, and primary hypomagnesemia are expressed in the corresponding pronephric

segments. The pronephric nephron model, together with the
collection of more than 100 novel segment-specific marker
genes reported here, represents an essential framework with
which to dissect the molecular basis of vertebrate nephron
segmentation in the Xenopus embryo model and may contribute to our understanding of human renal disease.

Genome-wide slc gene expression analysis defines a
large panel of pronephric marker genes

Gene expression patterns were analyzed by whole-mount in
situ hybridization using Xenopus embryos at selected developmental stages, in accordance with the terminology established by Nieuwkoop and Faber (1956) [28]: 20 (22 hours
postfertilization [hpf]), 25 (28 hpf), 29/30 (35 hpf), 35/36 (50
hpf), and 40 (66 hpf). The stages were chosen to cover the key
steps of pronephric kidney organogenesis: initiation of nephrogenesis (stage 20), onset of cellular differentiation (stage
25), maturation and terminal differentiation (stages 29/30
and 35/36), and acquisition of full excretory organ functions
(stage 40; Figure 1a) [14,15].

A genome-scale, whole-mount in situ hybridization screen
was performed to evaluate the expression of solute carrier
(slc) genes during Xenopus pronephric kidney development.
We mined public databases to identify cDNAs encoding
Xenopus laevis slc genes. In total, 225 unique slc Xenopus
cDNAs were identified that encoded genuine orthologs of
human SLC genes, based on phylogenetic analyses and synteny mapping (DR and AWB, unpublished data). The
retrieved Xenopus slc orthologs represent 64% of all human
SLC genes (total 352).

Of the 225 slc genes identified, we detected expression of 210
genes during the embryonic stages tested, and thereof 101
genes (48%) were expressed specifically during pronephric
kidney development (Figure 1b). The first evidence for pronephric expression of slc genes was identified at stage 25, at
which ten genes could be detected (Figure 1b). These included
the Na-K-Cl transporter slc12a1 (nkcc2), the facilitated glucose transporter slc2a2 (glut2) and the amino acid
transporters slc6a14, slc7a3, and slc7a7 (Additional data file

1). By stage 29/30, expression of 65 genes - representing the
majority (64%) of the slc genes tested - could be detected.
This correlates well with the onset of epithelial differentiation
and lumen formation [14,15]. The number of expressed slc
genes increases to 91 and 89 at stages 35/36 and 40, respectively (Figure 1b), as the pronephric nephron undergoes terminal differentiation and acquires characteristics of a
functional excretory organ. Complete lists of slc genes
expressed for each stage of pronephric development tested
are provided in Additional data file 1.

A comprehensive model for pronephric segmentation
revealed by slc gene expression mapping
Our gene expression studies indicated that all 101 slc genes
exhibited spatially restricted expression patterns in the developing pronephric kidney. Because slc genes encode terminal
differentiation markers, we reasoned that a systematic analysis of the slc gene expression domains could reveal the underlying segmental organization of the differentiated pronephric
nephron.
The nephron of the stage 35/36 pronephric kidney was
selected for slc gene expression mapping along the proximodistal axis. Robust expression of most slc genes was evident
by this stage, which preceded the onset of pronephric functions by about 3 hours. Furthermore, the stage 35/36 nephron retains a simple structure, lacking areas of extensive
tubular convolution. It is largely a linear epithelial tube
stretched out along the anteroposterior body axis. Characteristic morphological landmarks (somites, thickenings, and
looped areas of the nephron) facilitate the mapping of the
gene expression domains that can be performed on whole
embryos without need for sectioning. A contour map of the
stage 35/36 nephron was developed from embryos subjected
to whole-mount in situ hybridization with fxyd2, pax2, and
wnt4 probes (see Materials and methods, below, for details).
The obtained model covered the three nephrostomes, which
mark the most proximal end of the nephron, followed by
three tubules, which merge to form a long-stretched duct that
connects at its distal end to the cloaca. Subsequently, the
expression domains of each slc gene were carefully mapped
onto the stage 35/36 model nephron.
The segmental organization that emerged from slc gene
expression mapping is shown in Figure 2a. It revealed a previously unappreciated complexity and extends an older
model reported by Zhou and Vize [19]. In addition to the
nephrostomes, which connect the pronephric nephron to the
coelomic cavity and the glomerular filtration apparatus, eight
functionally distinct segments were defined. Cross-species
gene expression comparisons were performed to delineate
similarities between the Xenopus pronephric and mammalian metanephric nephron (see below). These studies revealed
striking analogies, allowing us to adopt a nomenclature for
the pronephric segments that largely follows the widely
accepted one used for the mammalian metanephros [2],

Volume 9, Issue 5, Article R84

which is shown in Figure 2b. The pronephric nephron of
Xenopus is composed of four basic domains: proximal tubule,
intermediate tubule, distal tubule, and connecting tubule.
Each tubule may be further subdivided into distinct segments. The proximal tubule (PT) is divided into three segments (PT1, PT2, and PT3), whereas the intermediate tubule
(IT) and the distal tubule (DT) are both composed of two segments IT1 and IT2, and DT1 and DT2, respectively. In contrast, the connecting tubule (formerly known as pronephric
duct) does not appear to be further subdivided. The molecular
evidence supporting the proposed segmentation model and
nomenclature are discussed in detail below.

Distribution of slc gene expression in the pronephric
kidney
The complete annotation of the pronephric expression
domains for each slc gene can be found in Additional data file
2. The slc gene expression domains were characterized by
sharp, conserved expression boundaries, which define the
limits of the segments and tubules. A given expression
domain could either be confined to a single segment, comprise an entire tubule, or spread over more than one tubule.
Of the 91 slc genes analyzed for expression in the stage 35/36
pronephric kidney, we detected expression of 75 genes in the
proximal tubule, 27 genes in the intermediate tubule, 24
genes in the distal tubule, and 13 genes in the connecting
tubule (Additional data files 3 to 6).

Expression domains of slc genes define three segments
in the proximal tubule
With 75 genes, the proximal tubules exhibited the greatest
complexity of slc gene expression. This underscores their
importance in reabsorbing diverse classes of solutes from the
glomerular ultrafiltrate. We identified 26 genes with exclusive expression throughout the proximal tubule compartment. Among these, 18 were strongly expressed and included
slc2a2, slc3a1, slc4a7, slc5a11, slc22a5, and slc26a1 (Figure
3a and Additional data file 2). The expression domains of
other slc genes revealed a further subdivision of the proximal
tubule into three distinct segments (PT1, PT2, and PT3). This
tripartite organization is reminiscent of mammalian proximal
tubules, which are commonly subdivided into S1, S2, and S3
segments [2].
Two genes were predominantly expressed in PT1 (the most
proximal segment of the proximal tubule), namely slc7a7 and
slc7a8. Low levels of expression could also be detected in PT2
(Figure 3b and Additional data file 2). Interestingly, all three
PT1 segments appear to be equivalent, because we do not
have evidence for differential expression of marker genes.
Two genes, namely slc25a10 and slc26a11, were exclusively
expressed in PT2 (Figure 3c), and slc1a1 and slc7a13 were
confined to PT3 (Figure 3d). Furthermore, we found several
examples of slc gene expression encompassing two segments.
Twelve genes including slc5a2 [22], slc6a19, and slc15a2 were
expressed in PT1 as well as PT2 (Figure 3e and Additional

The intermediate tubule, an S-shaped structure, follows distal
to the proximal tubule in the stage 35/36 pronephric nephron
(Figure 2a). It is characterized molecularly by the expression
of the thiamine transporter slc19a2 (Figure 4a). In addition,
slc genes with nonexclusive expression in the intermediate
tubule include slc4a11, slc12a1, slc16a7, and slc25a11 (Figure
4e and Additional data file 2). For example, slc12a1 expression extends into the distal tubule to include DT1 (Figure 4e).
The boundaries of the intermediate tubule are also defined by
slc4a4, which was not detected in the intermediate tubule but
was prominently expressed in the flanking proximal and distal tubule domains (Figure 4d).

Models of the segmental organization of the Xenopus pronephric and
mammalian metanephric nephrons. The color coding of analogous
nephron segments is based on the comparison of marker gene expression
as shown in Figure 7. (a) Schematic representation of the stage 35/36
Xenopus pronephric kidney. The glomerular filtration apparatus (G; also
known as glomus) is derived from the splanchnic layer of the intermediate
mesoderm and receives blood from vessels that branch from the dorsal
aorta. All other parts of the pronephric nephron are derivatives of the
somatic layer of the intermediate mesoderm. On the basis of molecular
markers, four distinct tubular compartments can be recognized. Each
tubule may be further subdivided into distinct segments: proximal tubule
(PT, yellow; PT1, PT2, and PT3), intermediate tubule (IT, green; IT1 and
IT2), distal tubule (DT, orange; DT1 and DT2), and connecting tubule (CT,
gray). The nephrostomes (NS) are ciliated peritoneal funnels that connect
the coelomic cavity (C) to the nephron. The scheme was adapted from
Reggiani and coworkers [22]. (b) Scheme depicting a short-looped and a

data file 2). In contrast, 13 slc genes, including slc2a11 and
slc5a1, were detected in both PT2 and PT3 (Figure 3f and
Additional data file 2). The molecular subdivision of the proximal tubule revealed by segment-specific markers is also evident morphologically. Three PT1 segments connect the
nephrostomes to a single PT2 segment. The adjacent distal
region corresponds to PT3 and can be identified as a bulging

The intermediate tubule is comprised of two segments,
namely IT1 and IT2. The molecular evidence for this subdivision was provided by the expression of slc20a1 in the proximal part (IT1) and slc5a8 in the distal part (IT2; Figure 4b,c).
Although slc5a8 expression occurs also in the proximal
tubules (PT2 and PT3) and in the distal tubule (DT1), the
expression domain in the intermediate tubules defines unequivocally the boundary between IT1 and IT2 (Figure 4c). The
bipartite nature of the intermediate tubule is further supported by the expression of irx transcription factor family
members irx1, irx2, and irx3 [22].

Organization of distal and connecting tubules revealed
by slc gene expression
The distal tubule occupies roughly the proximal half of the
stretch-out part of the pronephric nephron (Figure 2a). To
date we have failed to identify an slc gene with expression in
the entire distal tubule only. However, the distal expression
domain of slc16a6 comprises the entire distal tubule (Additional data file 2). The distal tubule is composed of two distinct segments: DT1 and DT2. Molecularly, DT1 was defined
by the expression of the sodium bicarbonate transporter
slc4a4; however, this transporter also has a second expression domain in the proximal tubule (Figure 4d). In addition,
several slc genes were identified that have DT1 as their most
distal expression domain. These included slc4a11, slc5a8, and
slc12a1 (Figure 4c,e and Additional data file 2). DT2 was
demarcated by expression of the ammonia transporter rhcg/
slc42a3 (Figure 4f). Furthermore, slc12a3 shared DT2 as its
most proximal expression domain (Figure 4h).
The connecting tubule links the pronephric kidney to the rectal diverticulum and the cloaca. Two slc genes exhibited
exclusive expression in this compartment, namely the
sodium/calcium exchanger slc8a1 and the zinc transporter
slc30a8 (Figure 4g and Additional data file 2). To date, we
have not obtained any evidence supporting further subdivision of the connecting tubule.

Validation of the pronephric segmentation model
We extended our gene expression analysis to the claudin
(cldn) gene family and selected other genes to validate the
proposed model of pronephric segmentation. Claudins are
key components of epithelial tight junctions, where they are
responsible for the selectivity and regulation of paracellular
permeability [30,31]. In the mammalian kidney, several claudin genes are expressed in segment-specific patterns along
the nephron [30,32]. We profiled the claudin gene family for
evidence of nephron segment-specific gene expression in
Xenopus. We retrieved 14 distinct Xenopus claudin cDNAs
from database searches, which covers 64% of the complement
of 22 claudin genes typically found in vertebrate genomes. We
analyzed the expression of 13 claudin genes by whole-mount
in situ hybridization and found that eight genes were
expressed in the developing pronephric kidney (Figure 1c and
Additional data file 2). No pronephric expression of claudin
genes was detected at stage 20. Induction of cldn6 expression
occurred at stage 25, and by stage 35/36 all eight cldn genes
were expressed (Figure 1c and Additional data file 1). The
temporal profile of claudin gene expression during pronephric kidney development therefore mirrors the situation
reported for the slc genes (Figure 1b,c). Four cldn genes
(cldn3, cldn4, cldn6, and cldn12) were expressed throughout
the entire stage 35/36 nephron. In contrast, expression of the
other cldn genes was highly regionalized. Interestingly, all
shared expression in the intermediate tubule. The cldn8 gene
had the most restricted expression, being present only in the
IT2 segment (Figure 5a). Apart from the intermediate tubule,
the expression domains of cldn14 and cldn16 extended distally to include DT1 (Figure 5b,c). Finally, transcripts for
cldn19 were present not only in the intermediate tubule but
also in the nephrostomes (Figure 5d).
We also studied the expression of the kidney-specific chloride
channel clcnk, the potassium channel kcnj1 (also known as
romk), and the calcium-binding protein calbindin 1 (calbindin 28 kDa; calb1). Previously, we reported clcnk to be a
marker of the pronephric duct [17], and more recently
mapped its expression to cover the intermediate, distal, and
connecting tubules [22] (Figure 5e). Expression of kcnj1 was
similar to that of clcnk, with the exception that kcnj1 was not
present in IT2 (Figure 5f). Finally, calb1 expression was
restricted to the connecting tubule with highest expression at
the distal tip (Figure 5g). Expression throughout the connecting tubule segment became more apparent by stage 40 (data
not shown). In summary, the analysis of additional pronephric marker genes fully supports our proposed model of
pronephric nephron segmentation. For example, cldn8 and
kcnj1 expression provides further evidence for the bipartite
nature of the intermediate tubule compartment. Furthermore, we failed to detect any evidence for additional subdivisions of the nephron other than the ones reported here.

Gene expression comparisons reveal striking analogies
of nephron segmentation between pronephric and
metanephric kidneys
We performed cross-species gene expression comparisons to
identify similarities between the nephron organization of the
Xenopus pronephros and the mammalian metanephros. We
selected 23 marker genes with highly regionalized expression
in the Xenopus pronephric kidney to compare their renal
expression domains with the corresponding mammalian
orthologs. As shown in Table 1, the list included 18 slc genes,
calb1, cldn8, cldn16, clcnk, and kcnj1. Information on the
expression of the mammalian counterparts in either the adult
mouse or rat kidney was obtained in part from the published
literature (Table 2). In addition, we determined independently the expression patterns for many of the selected genes
by in situ hybridization analysis. Selected examples of stained
adult mouse kidney sections are shown in Figure 6. We determined the previously unknown renal expression domains of
Slc5a9, Slc6a13, Slc13a3, and Slc16a7 (Figure 6 and data not
shown). Furthermore, we confirmed the expression domains
of many others, including Slc5a2, Slc7a13, Slc8a1, Slc12a1,
Slc12a3, Cldn8, and Calb1 (Table 2, Figure 6, and data not
shown).
A comparison of the expression domains of the selected
marker genes between the Xenopus pronephros and the
rodent metanephros is shown schematically in Figure 7.
Overall, a remarkable conservation of segmental gene expression was observed. This was most striking for the proximal
tubule. All 13 mammalian genes with expression in the proximal tubule were also expressed in the Xenopus proximal
tubule. Generally, only minor differences between Xenopus
and mammalian marker genes were observed. In many cases,
however, we found complete conservation of segmental
expression domains. This is best illustrated by the low-affinity and high-affinity Na-glucose transporters Slc5a2 and
Slc5a1, which are sequentially expressed along the proximodistal axis of the proximal tubule [33]. Slc5a2 localizes to S1
and S2 in mouse and to PT1 and PT2 in Xenopus, whereas
Slc5a1 was detected in S2 and S3, and PT2 and PT3, respectively (Figure 3e,f, Figure 6a, and data not shown).
The comparison of gene expression in the intermediate
tubule revealed a more complex picture. Importantly, there
was clear evidence for expression of Cldn8 and Clcnk in the
intermediate tubules of Xenopus and mouse. The Cldn8 gene,
which in mouse is expressed in the descending thin limb, was
confined to IT2 in Xenopus (Figure 5a and Figure 6g). With
regard to Clcnk, the broad expression domain (IT1 → connecting tubule) of the single Xenopus clcnk gene was
comparable to the combined expression domains of Clcnka
(ascending thin limb) and Clcnkb (thick ascending limb
[TAL] to collecting duct) in mouse kidney (Figure 5e and data
not shown). Moreover, we observed that the Xenopus intermediate tubule shares some transport properties with the
mammalian TAL. In Xenopus, slc12a1, slc16a7, cldn16, and

kcnj1 - whose murine counterparts are markers of the TAL
(Table 2) - exhibited striking proximal expansions of their
expression domains to include segments of the intermediate
tubule (Figure 7).
The distal tubule in mammals can be divided structurally into
two compartments: the TAL and the distal convoluted tubule

(DCT). Molecularly, it is defined by the differential expression
of the Na-K-Cl transporter Slc12a1 in the TAL and the Na-Cl
cotransporter Slc12a3 in the DCT (Figure 6d,e). We found
that this was also the case for the Xenopus distal tubule. Note
that the junctions between the slc12a1 and slc12a3 expression
domains define the boundary between DT1 and DT2 (Figure
4e,h). We also noticed that the Xenopus orthologs of mouse

TAL markers were expressed in the Xenopus DT1. When comparing the mouse DCT with the Xenopus DT2, striking similarities became apparent. As mentioned above, we could
demonstrate expressions of the key marker slc12a3 and of
clcnk, kcnj1, and the ammonia transporter Rhcg/Slc42a3 in
DT2. However, we found one exception relating to the expression of the calcium-binding protein encoded by Calb1, which
is a marker of the mouse DCT and connecting tubule (Figure
6h). In Xenopus, calb1 was not expressed in DT2 but in the
connecting tubule only (Figure 5g). Taken together, the Xenopus DT1 and DT2 are analogous to the mouse TAL and DCT,
respectively.
In mouse kidney, the connecting tubule can be identified on
the basis of Slc8a1 expression (Figure 6c). Interestingly,
expression of Xenopus slc8a1 also defines a distinct compartment adjacent to the distal tubule, which we termed connecting tubule. As in the mouse, the Xenopus connecting tubule
expresses slc16a7, calb1, clcnk, and kcnj1, which further
emphasize the similarities between the connecting tubules of
the pronephros and metanephros (Figure 5e-g, Figure 6f,h,
and data not shown).

The Xenopus pronephric kidney lacks a nephron
segment analogous to the mammalian collecting duct
We assessed Xenopus embryos for the expression of marker
genes of the mammalian collecting duct. First, we analyzed
three aquaporin genes, namely aqp2, aqp3, and aqp4, which
are markers of principal cells in the mammalian collecting
duct [34-37]. None of the tested genes were expressed in the
pronephric kidney (data not shown). Subsequently, we analyzed slc4a1 (AE1), a marker of type A intercalated cells of the
cortical and medullary collecting ducts [38], and slc26a4
(pendrin), which is expressed in type B intercalated cells of
the connecting tubule and cortical collecting duct in the adult
mammalian kidney [39]. No expression could be detected in
the stage 35/36 pronephric kidney (data not shown). We
therefore conclude that there is presently no molecular evidence indicating that the stage 35/36 Xenopus pronephric
kidney harbors a nephron segment that shares molecular
characteristics with the mammalian collecting duct.

form of an interactive database. XGEbase [27] currently
contains whole-mount in situ hybridization data on 210 slc
genes. The embryonic expression patterns are documented by
more than 1,200 representative microscopic in situ hybridization images. The pronephric expression patterns are fully
annotated in accordance with our model. Moreover, we also
identified more than 100 genes expressed in spatially
restricted patterns within other non-renal tissues such as
brain, liver, and heart (DR and AWB, unpublished data). OK!
Although not the explicit focus of the present study, the
obtained expression patterns were fully annotated in accordance with the Xenopus Anatomy Ontology [40] and deposited
in XGEbase. Hence, XGEbase provides not only a unique
resource for future studies on pronephric kidney develop-

ment and function, but also enhances our general understanding of organogenesis in the Xenopus model.

Discussion
Complexity of the Xenopus pronephric kidney revealed
by large-scale gene expression mapping
The pronephric nephron was until recently considered to be a
simple structure composed of pronephric tubules and the
pronephric duct [14,15] (Figure 8a). This apparent simplicity
of the bilateral excretory organs of amphibian larvae was first
recognized almost 180 years ago with the identification of the
Wolffian body (Wolffschen Körper) and the associated
excretory duct (Ausführungsgang) [41]. A more complex

which may correspond to the neck segment found in some mammalian species such as rabbits [67,68], are not shown. Dark and pale blue colors indicate
strong and low expression levels, respectively. Note that only a single clcnk gene is known in Xenopus, whereas there are two mouse Clcnk genes. The
expression of Xenopus clcnk in the intermediate, distal, and connecting tubules has therefore to be compared with the combined renal expression domains
of mouse Clcnka and Clcnkb. The abbreviations for segments of the pronephric and metanephric nephrons are given in the legend to Figure 2.

view emerged from a reconstruction of the larval pronephros
of Bufo viridis combined with ultrastructural examinations
[16]. Excluding the nephrostomes, the pronephric nephron
was subdivided into three domains (Figure 8b): a proximal
tubule composed of columnar epithelia with well developed
brush borders, followed by a distal tubule with cuboidal epithelia, and a duct with low cylindrical epithelial cells. Based
on the localized expression of nine membrane transporter
genes, additional early and late subdomains of both the proximal and distal tubules were identified molecularly, and a
terminology was adopted that was previously used for the
mesonephric nephron [19] (Figure 8b). The degree of similarity between the nephron organization of the Xenopus pronephros and the mammalian metanephros remains unclear,
however.
Our analysis, which included more than 100 molecular
marker genes, revealed an even more complex picture.
Although we were able to confirm the compartment boundaries defined by Zhou and Vize [19], our analysis revealed three
additional domains of the pronephric nephron, which had not
previously been described. Further subdivisions of the early
proximal tubule, the early distal tubule, and duct were recognized, culminating in the most comprehensive model of
pronephric nephron segmentation reported to date (Figure
8c).

Raciti et al. R84.14

An evolutionary perspective on vertebrate nephron
organization
Similarities between the eight distinct Xenopus pronephric
nephron segments and mammalian metanephric nephron
segments were established on the basis of conserved marker
gene expression (Figure 7). The basic architecture of the
mammalian nephron - with four main compartments (the
proximal tubule, intermediate tubule, distal tubule, and collecting duct system) and their further subdivision - are well
established on the basis of morphological criteria [2,3] (Figure 2b and Figure 8d). Remarkably, the expression of many
marker genes in the nephron segments of the mammalian
metanephros was confined to equivalent segments of the
Xenopus pronephros. On the basis of these findings, we have
redefined the molecular anatomy of the Xenopus pronephros
and propose a novel nomenclature that acknowledges the
striking similarities with the mammalian nephron (Figure
8c). Unlike previous models of the zebrafish and Xenopus
pronephros [16,19,42], we define an intermediate tubule
compartment, identify a segment with characteristics of the
distal convoluted tubule, and clarify the analogies between
the pronephric duct and the mammalian collecting duct system. Our findings suggest that the basic architecture of the
nephron evolved early in vertebrate evolution and that the
last common ancestor of mammals and amphibians, more
than 360 million years ago [43,44], must have already possessed excretory organs comprised of four distinct, segmented tubules. Clearly, subsequent evolution has modified

this basic architecture in a species-specific manner to meet
the differing physiological requirements of vertebrates residing in diverse sets of habitats and environments.

The pronephric proximal tubule shares many
transport activities with its metanephric counterpart
By focusing the large-scale gene expression analysis of the
pronephric kidney on slc genes, we have now obtained
unprecedented insights into the diversity and scope of physiological transport activities carried out by the pronephric kidney. The panel of 225 slc genes included representatives of 46
slc gene families. We found that slc genes representing 35 slc
gene families were clearly expressed in the pronephric kidney. Remarkably, of the more than 100 slc genes with pronephric expression we had identified, 75 were expressed in the
proximal tubule.
The mammalian proximal tubule is responsible for bulk reabsorption of more than 70% of the filtered solutes in the primary urine, which includes ions (sodium, chloride,
potassium, calcium, phosphate, and bicarbonate), vital nutrients (glucose and amino acids), and water. Molecular evidence that the proximal domains of the pronephric kidney
can support some of these transport activities was reported
previously [17,19,20,45]. The present study uncovers, on the
basis of slc gene expression patterns, the broad scope of
inferred transport activities carried out by pronephric proximal tubules (Additional data file 3). We provide here evidence
for the expression of transporters that mediate uptake of glucose (members of the slc2 and scl5 gene families), amino
acids (slc1, slc3, slc7, slc17, slc36, and slc38), peptides (slc15),
bicarbonate (slc4), acetyl-coenzyme A (slc33), nucleosides
(slc28 and slc29), vitamins (slc19 and slc23), and metal ions
(slc30, slc31, and slc39). Apart from reabsorptive activities,
the mammalian proximal tubule is also the site of ammonia
production and secretion of organic anions and cations.
Expression of genes that encode transporters for ammonium
(rhbg/slc42a2), organic ions (slc22), and organic anions
(slco) provides compelling evidence in favor of the notion that
similar activities are associated with the proximal tubules of
the Xenopus pronephros. We conclude that the proximal
tubule shares a strikingly high degree of structural and functional similarity with the mammalian proximal tubule.

Evidence for an intermediate tubule compartment in
the pronephros
Identification of a compartment that shares molecular characteristics with the intermediate tubule of the metanephros
represents a major, unanticipated outcome of the present
study. In birds and mammals, the intermediate tubule of the
metanephric kidney gives rise to the thin limbs of Henle's
loop, which are required to concentrate urine [2,3,46]. In
contrast, the kidneys of larval and adult amphibians do not
develop loops of Henle. Their urine is hypo-osmotic to the
blood plasma, and they produce very dilute urine in
freshwater [4]. Consistent with these findings, the existence

Volume 9, Issue 5, Article R84

Raciti et al. R84.15

of an intermediate tubule segment in the pronephric kidney
had also previously been ruled out on the basis of ultrastructural studies [16]. Our arguments for postulating an intermediate tubule for the pronephros are based on molecular
evidence and functional studies.
To date, only a few genes with specific expression in the thin
limbs of Henle are known. These include aquaporin1 (Aqp1),
the UT-A2 splice variant of the urea transporter Slc14a2, and
claudin 8 (Cldn8) in the descending thin limb; and the
kidney-specific chloride channel Clcnka in the ascending thin
limb [47,48]. In Xenopus, the expression of slc14a2 could not
be determined because no appropriate cDNA was available,
and we failed to detect any pronephric expression of aqp1
(data not shown). In contrast, we were able to demonstrate
cldn8 and clcnk expression in the intermediate tubules (Figure 5a,e). Furthermore, comparative gene expression analysis
recently demonstrated that Irx homeobox transcription factors mark an intermediate compartment in the developing
nephron of both the pronephros and the metanephros [22].
Interestingly, functional studies in Xenopus have shown that
irx3 is required for intermediate tubule formation [22].
Taken together, molecular evidence and functional studies
demonstrate the existence of a patterning mechanism for
intermediate tubule formation at the level of the Xenopus
pronephros. Despite sharing molecular similarities with the
mammalian thin limb (cldn8 and clckn expression), the intermediate tubules of the Xenopus pronephric kidneys have also
acquired characteristics of the distal tubule, which manifests
as proximal expansion of the expression domains of the distal
tubule marker genes slc12a1, slc12a6, and kcnj1 (Figure 7). It
therefore appears that the intermediate tubules of the pronephros have evolved to function in the reabsorption of salts
and ions.

The Xenopus distal tubule shares similarities with the
mammalian thick ascending limb and distal convoluted
tubule
The mammalian distal tubule consists of two segments, TAL
and DCT. The TAL remains impermeable to water and reabsorbs up to 25% of the filtered sodium and chloride via the
Na-K-Cl transporter Slc12a1. Net movement of sodium across
the TAL requires the recycling of potassium via the potassium
channel Kcnj1 and the transport of chloride by the kidneyspecific Clcnkb [49]. The TAL is also a major site of renal
magnesium reabsorption, which occurs predominantly
through a paracellular pathway and requires claudin 16/paracellin-1 (Cldn16) function [50]. Remarkably, we found that
the DT1 segment of the Xenopus pronephros expresses the
same set of genes mentioned above, which suggests that it is
largely analogous to the TAL.
The transition from TAL to DCT is characterized by the sharp
change in gene expression from Slc12a1 to the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl transporter Slc12a3 (NCC) in different species of
mammals [51]. Interestingly, this highly characteristic fea-

Genome Biology 2008, 9:R84

http://genomebiology.com/2008/9/5/R84

Genome Biology 2008,

ture can also be observed in the Xenopus pronephros, where
the same transition defines the border between DT1 and DT2.
In addition to its role in sodium chloride reabsorption, the
DCT also regulates the pH by absorbing bicarbonate and it
secretes protons into the urine. The expression of the bicarbonate transporter slc4a2 in the DT2 segment suggests that
similar functions are carried out by the Xenopus pronephros.
Furthermore, the highly restricted expression of rhcg/
slc42a3 indicates that the DT2 is capable of ammonium
transport similar to the DCT [52,53]. Taken together, the
present molecular evidence is in line with our proposal that
the DT2 is the pronephric equivalent of the DCT in the
metanephros.

The pronephros harbors a simplified collecting duct
system
In the mammalian metanephros, the collecting duct system is
composed of the connecting tubule followed by the cortical
and medullary collecting ducts. Our gene expression analysis
of the pronephric kidney suggests that a single nephron segment links the distal tubule to the rectal diverticulum and the
cloaca. The expression of the Na-Ca exchanger slc8a1 and the
calcium-binding protein calb1 indicates that this segment
shares molecular characteristics with the mammalian connecting tubule. We therefore refer to this segment of the
pronephric nephron as the connecting tubule.
Despite the unexpected high degree of similarity in nephron
organization, the pronephric and metanephric kidneys differ
markedly in the organization of the collecting duct. We
assessed the expression of several established marker genes
of the mammalian collecting duct, such as slc4a1, slc26a4,
and the aquaporins aqp2, aqp3, and aqp4, but we failed to
detect any expression in the stage 35/36 pronephric kidney.
At present, we cannot rule out the possibility that expression
of these marker genes occurs only in older, more mature
pronephric kidneys. In fact, when we assessed stage 40
embryos, we detected expression of the type A intercalated
cell marker slc4a1 in the connecting tubule, the rectal diverticulum, and the cloaca; and the type B marker slc26a4 in the
cloaca (DR and AWB, unpublished data). In contrast, no
pronephric expression of aqp2, aqp3, and aqp4 was found.
Although further analysis is still needed, these preliminary
findings suggest that the maturation of intercalated cells may
take place late after the onset of pronephric functions at stage
37/38.
The collecting duct system plays a major role in the final concentration of urine [7] and is therefore the last structure of the
nephron that can modify the electrolyte and fluid balance in
the mammalian body. The constraints on the body's physiology are different for Xenopus tadpoles living in fresh water.
They are required to conserve salts and must excrete copious
amounts of diluted urine to maintain water balance [4]. It is
therefore not surprising that we failed to detect any evidence
for pronephric expression of aquaporins. We conclude that

Volume 9, Issue 5, Article R84

Raciti et al. R84.16

the collecting duct system of pronephric kidney consists of a
single nephron segment sharing similarities with the connecting tubule.

The Xenopus pronephros as a novel model for human
renal diseases
In recent years, mutations in various SLC genes and genes
encoding ion channels and claudins have been discovered as
the underlying causes of various forms of familial renal diseases in humans. The mutations impair important physiological functions that are confined to specific nephron segments,
such as the proximal tubule, the TAL, and the DCT [54].
Interestingly, our large-scale gene expression analysis has
now provided clear evidence that the Xenopus orthologs of at
least 11 human renal disease genes were expressed in the
equivalent nephron segments of the pronephric kidney (Table
3 and Additional data file 2). We therefore believe that the
Xenopus embryo may become a useful model for rapid analysis of the basic molecular and regulatory processes that are
involved in inherited human renal disease.

Conclusion

The present study revealed that the pronephric nephron is
composed of four basic domains: proximal tubule, intermediate tubule, distal tubule, and connecting tubule. These
domains share at the molecular level gene signatures that are
typical of the mammalian nephron, and can be further
subdivided into eight functionally distinct segments. The
striking structural and functional similarities between the
pronephric and the metanephric nephron revealed in this
study will allow us to analyze in greater detail genes involved
in nephron patterning, a process that remains poorly understood. Moreover, gene mutations underlying human renal
disease can now be analyzed in a simple and cost-effective
animal model.

Materials and methods
Gene nomenclature
The standard gene nomenclature suggested by Xenbase [55]
and adopted by the National Center for Biotechnology Information for X. laevis genes is utilized rather than the original
gene names to maximize compatibility with data available
from other model systems. Where possible, Xenopus gene
names are the same as their human orthologs.

Identification and sequencing of Xenopus cDNAs
Screening of nonredundant and expressed sequence tag
nucleotide databases for X. laevis cDNAs encoding slc,
claudin, and aquaporin genes was performed at the National
Center for Biotechnology Information BLAST website [56].
Initially, representative human SLC amino acid sequences
were obtained from the Human Gene Organization database
(HUGO) [57]. Later, reference sequences of human slc, claudin, and aquaporin genes were obtained from GenBank. The

TBLASTN searches, which compare a protein sequence with
the six-frame translations of a nucleotide database. Where
more than one Xenopus cDNA sequence was retrieved, the
cDNA encoding the longest open reading frame was selected

The X. laevis cDNAs were obtained from the German

the National Institute for Basic Biology (NIBB) in Japan. The
cDNAs were obtained either as sequence-verified clones

enzyme digestion or PCR products of the cDNA inserts generated by amplification with the appropriate T3, T7, or SP6
primers. Inserts cloned into the pDNRLib vector were amplified by PCR using the following primers: pDNRlib lower: 5'GTC TAG AAA GCT TCT CGA GGG-3'; and pDNRlib upper:
5'-GGA CAT ATG CCC GGG AAT TCG GCC-3'. The resulting
PCR products were subcloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA), in accordance with the
pGEM-T Easy Vector System I protocol. Digoxigenin-labeled
cRNA probes were either transcribed from linearized plasmids or made directly from PCR products using T7, T3, or
SP6 polymerases (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Sense strand
controls were prepared from all plasmids and tested by in situ
hybridization. The GenBank accession numbers of the cDNAs
used for in situ hybridization are given in Additional data file
2. The GenBank accession numbers for the Xenopus
aquaporin cDNAs are as follows: aqp1 (CD302300), aqp2
(AY151156), aqp3 (CA9711164), and aqp4 (BG515560). For
each reported gene, at least 40 embryos were examined.

gene mapping

Xenopus embryo manipulations and in situ
hybridization
In vitro fertilization, culture, and staging of Xenopus
embryos were performed as described [58,59,28]. Wholemount in situ hybridizations and bleaching of stained Xenopus embryos were carried out using established protocols
[59-61]. All pre-hybridization and post-hybridization washes
were performed in nylon mesh baskets using a BioLane HTI
in situ hybridization machine (Holle & Hüttner AG, Tübingen, Germany). For probe hybridization, the baskets with
embryos were transferred to 15 ml Falcon tubes and hybridizations were performed in a water bath. Templates for cRNA
probe synthesis were either plasmids linearized by restriction

A first schematic representation of the contour of the stage
35/36 nephron was developed from Xenopus embryos
stained by standard single-color whole-mount in situ hybridization with a combination of digoxigenin-labeled probes for
the pronephric marker genes fxyd2 [45], pax2 [62], and wnt4
[61]. Two dozen stained embryos were inspected to generate
a two-dimensional contour drawing of the nephron onto
paper. Refinements to the initial contour model were made
after inspection of hundreds of embryos stained with other
pronephric marker genes. The final contour model of the
nephron shown in Figure 2a was made with Illustrator CS2
(Adobe, San Jose, CA, USA).

The pronephric expression patterns of the marker genes were
projected onto the contour model to define the segments of
the nephron. Unambiguous morphological features, such as
the nephrostomes, a characteristically broad proximal tubule
domain known as common tubule [29] (subsequently named
PT3) and the looped part of the pronephric nephron (IT1, IT2,
and DT1) were used as landmarks to identify the relative location of the boundaries of the expression domains. The final
borders between the nephron segments are defined by the
boundaries of multiple marker genes.

Murine tissue preparation
Kidneys of male adult C57BL/6J mice were collected in icecold phosphate-buffered saline and subsequently transferred
into 4% paraformaldehyde for fixation at 4°C for at least 3
days. The kidneys were dehydrated in an ethanol series and
passed through xylene into paraffin with each step lasting a
full day. Paraffinized kidneys were sectioned in transversal
orientation at 8 nm thickness using a Leica RM 2165 microtome (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Sections were deparaffinized in X-tra-Solve (Medite Histotechnik, Burgdorf,
Germany), rehydrated, and then treated according to the protocol for fixation and acetylation of fresh frozen sections as
reported by Yaylaoglu and coworkers [63].

Murine in situ hybridization
Mouse cDNAs for Slc5a1 and Cldn8 were kindly provided by
Alexandre Reymond (University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland). Slc7a13 and Kcnj1 cDNAs were obtained from RZPD/
ImaGenes. Clone-derived template sequences were amplified
by PCR using standard primers for T7 and SP6. PCR products
were sequence verified and directly used for in vitro transcription. Templates for all other genes were generated by
PCR from a cDNA pool representing a variety of embryonic
and postembryonic tissues, as described previously [63]. The
primers consisted of 25 nucleotides of gene-specific sequence
linked to SP6, T3, or T7 polymerase promoter sites. Specific
primer sequences for the individual genes can be obtained
from the GenePaint database [64].
Riboprobe synthesis and robotic in situ hybridization were
carried out using established protocols [63]. The in situ
hybridization protocol includes a tyramine-biotin amplification reaction step. The protocol was adjusted for adult kidney
paraffin sections by increasing the proteinase K concentration to 10 mg/ml, using a probe concentration of 300 ng/ml,
and increasing the time of color reaction to three times 12
minutes.

Photography and computer graphics
For Xenopus, photographs of stained embryos were taken
digitally with an AxioCam Colour camera mounted on a Zeiss
SteREO Lumar V12 stereoscopic microscope using the Axio
Vision 4.5 (Zeiss, Feldbach, Switzerland) software. Image
processing was carried out using Adobe Photoshop CS2 and

Volume 9, Issue 5, Article R84

Raciti et al. R84.18

Adobe InDesign CS2 software. Schematic figures were drawn
using Adobe Illustrator CS2.
Stained slides of mouse kidney sections were scanned using a
Leica DM-RXA2 microscope equipped with the Leica electronic focusing system and a motorized stage (Märzhäuser,
Wetzlar-Steindorf, Germany). Brightfield images were collected with a CCD camera (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) and a 10×
objective (NA 0.40; Leica). Custom-made software was used
to drive stage and camera [65]. The kidney sections were too
large to be photographed as a whole. Therefore, multiple
images were taken. Each image was stored as a bitmap file
and individual images were assembled into a mosaic image
that was cropped, properly oriented, and saved as a TIFF file.
The resulting TIFF images with a resolution of 1.6 μm/pixel
were deposited in the GenePaint database along with metadata such as specimen, gene name, and probe sequence.

Informatics resources
The programming underlying the XGEbase web resource follows a classical three-tier architecture. The first tier is a webbased user interface providing an access point for users to
browse gene expression patterns in the developing
pronephros. The second tier is the application layer, which is
responsible for process management tasks. It is implemented
using Java and Java Server Faces (JSF) technologies. It
receives parameters from the client's machine to query the
core database and return dynamically generated web pages
based on the values retrieved from the database. The third
tier is the database management system (DBMS) and core
database. The DBMS is responsible for creation, maintenance, and interrogation of data stored in the database. The
application layer communicates with this layer in order to
retrieve specific data. A MySQL relational DBMS (version
5.0.4) [66] has been used to implement this layer.
In XGEbase, the pronephric expression patterns are fully
annotated in accordance with the nephron segmentation
model (Figure 2a), and the strength of the in situ hybridization signal is given for each anatomical structure. Important
meta-data, including GenBank accession numbers, in situ
hybridization probe details, and specimen preparation, are
provided for each gene. Furthermore, links are provided to
other related database such as Xenbase, Online Mendelian
Inheritance in Man (OMIM), Entrez, GenCards, Gene Ontology (GO), HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC),
and GenitoUrinary Development Molecular Anatomy Project
(GUDMAP). The database interface allows for browsing per
gene (individual level) or per segment of the pronephric kidney (comparative level). It is also possible to search images by
querying both the segment and the signal intensity. The database will be expanded to include other gene families with a
focus on terminal differentiation markers.
