Background
HIV-1 Env mediates viral entry into target cells and
defines R5 or X4 phenotype. HIV tropism is important in
pathogenesis and is associated with mother-to-child
transmission. Env is under strong selective pressure within
the host. The aim of this study was to determine whether
changes in maternal immunity associated with initiation
and progression of pregnancy influence Env sequence variation and HIV-1 coreceptor usage.

Methods
A longitudinal study of Env sequence variation was performed in 25 pregnant women infected with HIV-1 of
clade B (n = 16) or non-B (n = 9). Viral RNA was extracted
from plasma, the env gene (nucleotide positions 6430–
7374) was PCR-amplified and subcloned, and a mean of
20 clones were sequenced per trimester of pregnancy. HIV
tropism was predicted in silico using PSSMX4R5, PSSMSINSI,
SVM, geno2pheno and charge rule algorithms. Phylogenetic reconstructions were built, sequence diversity was
estimated using p distances and selective pressure (dN/dS)
was computed.

Results
In study subjects, HIV-1 viral load decreased progressively
during the course of pregnancy. Envelope sequences were
amplified at all trimesters in 63% of the cases. Phylogenetic analysis revealed at least partial clustering of
sequences per trimester in 4 out of 9 patients. Nucleic acid

p distances were negatively correlated with CD4+ T cell
counts at study entry (r2 = 0.66, p = 0.02). In all clade B
variants examined, R5 phenotype was predicted by all
algorithms. Interestingly, while predictions were not as
consistent with non-B subtypes, R5 and X4 variants were
shown to coexist during pregnancy in 4 of 5 cases. Of
note, evolution of tropism from R5 to X4 was observed in
one subject, and evolution from dual tropism to exclusive
X4 was observed in another subject between two consecutive pregnancies. Higher levels of genetic diversity in the
V2 region were observed in subjects infected with non-B
subtypes as compared with clade B variants. Finally, selective pressure on V2 tended to decrease with time in subjects infected with the B subtype but remained relatively
high in sequences derived from carriers of non-B subtypes.

Conclusion
This study provides insights into the possible interplay
between viral population dynamics and selective pressures exerted by maternal HIV-1 specific immune
response during pregnancy, insights that could prove
invaluable for the development of active and/or passive
immunization strategies to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1.
