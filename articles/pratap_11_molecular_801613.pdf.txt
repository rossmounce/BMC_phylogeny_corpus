Molecular characterization and infectivity of a
Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus variant
associated with newly emerging yellow mosaic
disease of eggplant in India
Dharmendra Pratap1, Ashwin R Kashikar2 and Sunil K Mukherjee1*

Abstract
Background: Begomoviruses have emerged as serious problem for vegetable and fiber crops in the recent past,
frequently in tropical and subtropical region of the world. The association of begomovirus with eggplant yellow
mosaic disease is hitherto unknown apart from one report from Thailand. A survey in Nagpur, Central India, in
2009-2010 showed severe incidence of eggplant yellow mosaic disease. Here, we have identified and characterized
a begomovirus responsible for the newly emerging yellow mosaic disease of eggplant in India.
Results: The complete DNA-A and DNA-B genomic components of the causative virus were cloned and
sequenced. Nucleotide sequence analysis of DNA-A showed that it shared highest 97.6% identity with Tomato leaf
curl New Delhi virus-India[India:Udaipur:Okra:2007] and lowest 87.9% identity with Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virusIndia[India:NewDelhi:Papaya:2005], while DNA-B showed highest 94.1% identity with ToLCNDV-IN[IN:UD:Ok:07] and
lowest 76.2% identity with ToLCNDV-India[India:Lucknow]. Thus, it appears that this begomovirus is a variant of
ubiquitous ToLCNDV and hence, we suggest the name ToLCNDV-India[India:Nagpur:Eggplant:2009] for this variant.
The pathogenicity of ToLCNDV-IN[IN:Nag:Egg:09] isolate was confirmed by agroinfiltraion and dimeric clones of
DNA-A and DNA-B induced characteristic yellow mosaic symptoms in eggplants and leaf curling in tomato plants.
Conclusion: This is the first report of a ToLCNDV variant moving to a new agriculturally important host, eggplant
and causing yellow mosaic disease. This is also a first experimental demonstration of Koch’s postulate for a
begomovirus associated with eggplant yellow mosaic disease.

Background
Geminiviruses (family Geminiviridae) possess monopartite or bipartite circular, single-stranded DNA genomes
encapsidated in geminate (18-22 nm diameters) particles. They infect a wide range of monocotyledonous and
dicotyledonous plants but each member of the Geminiviridae family has its own limited host range. They are
classified into four genera: Mastrevirus, Curtovirus,
Topocuvirus and Begomovirus, on the basis of their

genome organization, host range and insect vector [1,2].
A large number of important diseases are caused by
begomoviruses, which comprises of more than 180 species [1]. Begomoviruses are transmitted by whitefly
Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) predominantly in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world and cause
severe disease in dicot plants including tomato, pepper,
cassava, beans, cotton and cucurbits [3-5].
The majority of the begomoviruses are bipartite and
the genomic components are referred as DNA-A and
DNA-B [1,6]. DNA-A encodes the replication-associated
protein (Rep) which is essential for viral replication; the
replication enhancer protein (REn); the transactivator

protein (TrAP) that controls late gene expression and
involved in RNAi suppression; and the coat protein (CP)
for encapsidation and insect transmission. The DNA-B
encodes the nuclear shuttle protein (NSP) and the
movement protein (MP), both of which are vital in systemic spread and symptom expression. The two genomic components share a common region (CR) that
contains motifs required for the control of gene expression and initiation of replication. CR has conserved reiterated motifs and a putative stem-loop structure
containing the highly conserved nonanucleotide TAATATT↓AC, which is nicked by the Rep protein to initiate the rolling circle replication [7,8]. However, a few
Old World begomoviruses such as Tomato leaf curl
virus (ToLCV) and Tomato yellow leaf curl virus
(TYLCV) are monopartite and have single genomic
component, homologous to DNA-A of the bipartite
begomoviruses. These monopartite viruses require only
DNA-A to cause systemic infection [9-11].
In the recent past, novel satellite molecules called
betasatellites (formerly known as DNA-b), were found
to be associated with some monopartite begomoviruses
such as Cotton leaf curl Multan virus (CLCuMV), which
is responsible in the latest disease epidemic of cotton in
Pakistan [12]. Betasatellites (~1.4 kb) have sequences
unrelated to those of their helper begomoviruses but
intriguingly, they depend on helper virus for replication,
transmission and spread [13,14]. Betasatellites encode a
single gene bC1, which is known to be a gene silencing
suppressor [15]. Betasatellite is also known to play an
important role in determining the host range of its associated begomovirus [14,16,17]. Some of the betasatellite
molecules have relaxed trans-replication characteristics
[18] and it has also been established that association of
betasatellite increases disease severity and reduces the
period between inoculation and appearance of symptoms [19]. It has also been shown that betasatellite can
replace the movement function of DNA-B in case of
bipartite begomoviruses [20].
Eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) commonly known
as brinjal in India, is an economically important vegetable crop. The production of eggplant is severely affected
by a number of plant viruses, particularly the RNA
viruses [21]. Begomovirus association with eggplant is so
far unknown except for one report from Thailand [1,22].
The natural occurrence of eggplant yellow mosaic disease (EYMD) was observed in a survey conducted in
and around Nagpur region of Central India during
2009-2010 and the disease incidence was found to be
around 60-65%. The disease prevails across the year and
there is no significant seasonal variation about the severity of disease incidence. Infected plants showed severe
yellow mosaic and mottling of leaves at later stage of
infection. As the presence of whiteflies in the infected

Page 2 of 13

fields was noticed, we wanted to explore the possible
association of begomoviruses with the EYMD in central
India. We employed rolling circle amplification (RCA)
technique to identify the infecting begomovirus. Our
results revealed the clear association of a ToLCNDV
isolate with EYMD in India.
Furthermore, we constructed dimeric agroinfectious
clones from isolated genomic components and observed
successful infectivity of these agro-clones in eggplants as
well as in tomato plants. We have also recorded the period of disease appearance, symptom severity and accumulation of virus in the agroinfiltrated plants. We were
also interested to investigate the degree of disease severity when the non-cognate betasatellite is infiltrated
along with both the genomic components of the virus
and for the purpose, the dimeric clone of non cognate
betasatellite (CLCuMV) was used. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first record of a ToLCNDV variant moving to a new host, eggplant and causing EYMD
in India and we have artificially simulated the new
emerging disease thereby satisfying Koch’s postulates.

Methods
Genomic DNA isolation

Different leaf samples of eggplant showing yellow
mosaic symptoms were collected from various locations
of Nagpur in Central India. From the fields surveyed,
infected leaf samples from many different plants were
collected and used for genomic DNA isolation. Total
genomic DNA was isolated from infected samples by
Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method [23].
Full length genomic amplification

Full length viral genomes (DNA-A and DNA-B) were
amplified from the DNA isolated above using RCA [24]
based TempliPhi™ DNA amplification kit (GE Healthcare). RCA reaction was performed as per manufacturer’s instruction. The concatemers produced in the
reaction were monomerized by restriction digestion with
suitable restriction enzymes.
Cloning and sequencing

Aliquots of 1 μl of the above RCA products were
digested independently with various restriction enzymes:
BamHI, ClaI, EcoRI, HindIII, EcoRV, SacI, and NcoI.
Digested products were resolved on 1% agarose gel and
the bands corresponding to ~ 2.7 kb genomes were purified using Hi Yield™Gel/PCR DNA Mini Kit. The 2.7
kb monomers (A or B) were cloned into the respective
sites of pGreen0029 vector and henceforth, designated
as pGreen-1.0A (SacI) or pGreen-1.0B (XbaI). Monomeric full length clones were purified using HiYield™
Plasmid Mini Kit. Sequences of the recombinant clones
were determined commercially by TCGA Company,

Pratap et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:305
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/305

India. We also investigated for any possible presence
DNA-b satellite molecule in infected samples by RCA
and also by Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the
universal betasatellite primers, namely, Beta 01 and Beta
02 [25].
Sequence analysis

Sequences of all the monomeric clones were assembled
and analyzed using the software BIOEDIT version 7.0
programs [26]. Database searches with begomovirus
sequences were carried out by NCBI-BLAST program
(http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Nucleotide (nt) and
amino acid (aa) sequence alignments were performed
using CLUSTALW program using Mac Vector software
(v11.1.2; MacVector Inc., USA). The phylogenetic tree
was constructed using nucleotide sequences of complete
DNA-A and DNA-B of ToLCNDV isolates and other
selected begomovirus species reported from India and
worldwide. Few other selected begomoviruses causing
yellow mosaic disease in different plants were also taken
into consideration so as to reveal the relationship of the
virus isolate under study with its homologues. The phylogenetic tree was constructed with distance/neighborjoining method with 1000 bootstrap replications and
viewed with the help of MacVector suite program 10.5
(Mac Vector Inc, USA).
Construction of agroinfectious clones and their infectivity

To check the infectivity of the above virus isolate, we
used the high fidelity PCR based strategy for making
dimeric clones of both DNA-A and DNA-B. For the
purpose, we designed two different sets of abutting primers specific for amplifications of complete DNA-A and
DNA-B genomic components of the virus isolate. For
DNA-A, forward primer
5’-GAGCTCGTGCAGTTGTCCCCAT-3’ and reverse
primer
5’-AAGCTTCATAGGGGCTGTCGAAGTTGA-3’
were synthesized commercially (IDT, USA). The nucleotides underlined represent the respective restriction
sites. We incorporated one natural restriction site (SacI)
of the virus in the forward primer and one introduced
restriction site (HindIII) in the reverse primer for the
ease of cloning. The PCR conditions were as follows:
initial denaturation at 94°C, 30 cycles at 94°C for 1 min,
annealing for 1 min at 58°C, and extension for 3 min at
72°C, followed by a final extension of 10 min at 72°C.
The PCR product was subsequently cloned in pGEM-T
Easy vector (Promega) and the clones were confirmed
by colony PCR, restriction digestion and sequencing.
The 2.7 kb band, released by digestion with HindIII and
SacI from the recombinant pGEM-T Easy clone of
DNA-A, was subsequently cloned at the same restriction
sites of a binary vector pGreen 0029. This clone was

Page 3 of 13

named pG-A’. At the next step, the pGreen-1.0A plasmid DNA was digested with SacI and the 2.7 viral kb
DNA was recloned at the SacI site of pG-A’. In this
way, a complete head to tail DNA-A dimer was cloned
in pGreen0029 (hereafter called as pGreen-2.0A). Insert
integrity and orientation of the dimeric clones of DNAA were confirmed by restriction digestion with DraI, a
unique cutter in the viral DNA sequence. Two bands
corresponding to 7.3 and 2.7 kb dropped out following
digestion with DraI.
For construction of DNA-B dimeric clone, a similar
strategy was adopted. The abutting primers were
designed in a similar manner: forward primer 5’-TCTAGAACTCATTTGGTGTC-3’ and reverse primer 5’-CT
GCAGGAG AGAAACTGCAACTTCT-3’. The nucleotides underlined represent the respective restriction
sites. We incorporated one natural restriction site
(XbaI) in the forward primer and one introduced
restriction site (PstI) in the reverse primer. The PCR
conditions were same as described above for DNA-A.
The PCR products obtained were subsequently cloned
in pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) and the clones were
confirmed by restriction digestion and sequencing. The
2.7 kb DNA released by digestion with XbaI and PstI
from pGEM-T Easy clone of DNA-B was subsequently
cloned at the same restriction sites of binary vector
pGreen0029. The recombinant clone was named pG-B’.
The 2.7 kb viral DNA of pGreen-1.0B plasmid was subsequently mobilized at the XbaI site of pG-B’ and the
final dimeric clone was named pGreen-2.0B. Insert
integrity and orientation of clones were confirmed by
digestion with the internal cutter ScaI.
pGreen-2.0A and pGreen-2.0B plasmid DNAs were
mobilized into competent Agrobacterium tumefaciens
strain EHA105 with the helper plasmid pSoup by electroporation method using a Gene Pulser Apparatus[27].
Agrobacterium colonies were confirmed by colony PCR.
The primers were designed from the flanking sequences
of the inserts in the pGreen vector. Empty binary vector
pGreen0029 in Agrobacterium was used as negative control for mock inoculation on control plants. To study
the effects by betasatellite in disease severity, we also
used dimeric agroinfectious clone of non-cognate
CLCuMB betasatellite originated from northwestern
India-CLCuMB[IN:ND1:03] [28].
A. tumefaciens cultures were incubated with shaking
(200 rpm) at 28°C for 48 h (OD 600 = 1) in yeast
extract-Manitol (YEM) medium (pH 6.8) containing
kanamycin (50 μg/ml), rifampicin (20 μg/ml) and
chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml). Agrobacterium cells were
harvested and resuspended in MES buffer [10 mM 2(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES), 10 mM
Magnesium chloride (MgCl 2 )] and used for agroinfiltration on test plants.

Eggplant (Solanum melongena cv.Pusa Purple Long)
and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum cv. Pusa Ruby)
plants were grown in vermiculite inside a temperature
controlled glasshouse maintained at 25 ± 2°C and a 16/8
h light/dark cycle. 5-6 leaf stage eggplant and tomato
plants were used for agroinfiltration. All the agroinfectious constructs, pGreen-2.0A, pGreen-2.0B and pBin2.0b were used for infiltration in tomato and eggplants
either individually or in various combinations with equimolar concentrations as described earlier [29]. Five
plants each of eggplant and tomato plants were used for
various combinations of agro-constructs and agroinfiltrated plants were grown in an insect-free glasshouse
and the plants were maintained at 16/8 h light/dark periods for 30 weeks to observe the symptoms periodically.
Analysis of viral DNA in inoculated plants

Total genomic DNA isolated from agroinfiltrated plants
was used as a template for RCA. The templified products were digested with DNA-A specific single cutter
restriction enzyme and the digested products were analyzed on agarose gel. Semiquantitative-PCR was also
performed using ToLCNDV eggplant isolate DNA-A
specific abutting primers to examine the relative viral
accumulation efficiency of the virus in infiltrated test
plants. The band intensities were quantified using Image
J software. The quantified intensity values were normalized with respect to the respective actin controls which
was taken as negative control. The value obtained for A
+B was arbitrarily assigned as 100%. The sequence of
actin primers and PCR conditions were similar as
described earlier [30].

Results
Field detection of the viral disease and cloning of viral
DNA

Eggplants showing severe yellow mosaic symptoms were
observed in fields during a survey carried out in 20092010 in central India (Figure 1A, B). To characterize the
presence of begomovirus in the infected plants, total DNA
was isolated from the leaf samples of infected plants as
well as from healthy eggplants (as negative control). RCA
was performed with the isolated DNA and the RCA products were digested with different restriction enzymes.
The results presented in Figure 1C clearly demonstrate
the presence of ~2.7 kb product in case of infected samples when digested with HindIII, EcoRI, BamH1, SacI and
EcoRV, while no such band appeared on digestion with
NcoI. The appearance of 2.7 kb amplified DNA suggested
the presence of a begomovirus in the infected leaves. In
healthy leaf samples no band corresponding to 2.7 kb was
observed, as expected. The 2.7 kb fragments obtained
from digestion with above restriction enzymes were
directly cloned in pGreen0029 at their respective sites and
sequenced. The DNA was extracted separately from the
leaves of 15 different infected plants of same neighborhood and subjected to similar treatments of RCA followed
by restriction digestion. In every case, similar results were
obtained and the amplified and digested DNAs were
cloned and sequenced. About twenty clones from the leaf
DNA of each infected plant were sequenced.
Viral DNA sequence analysis

The end sequences (about 700 bases in total), obtained
from each of the positive samples, showed the presence

of a bipartite (DNA-A and DNA-B) begomovirus. All
DNA-A clones were found to be more than 99% identical amongst themselves and all the DNA-B clones were
also about 97% identical amongst themselves. Hence, for
subsequent studies, only a few clones of each type, i.e.,
having either DNA-A or DNA-B, were chosen for
further characterization of the virus. To sequence the
remaining portion of DNA-A and DNA-B, primer walking was carried out by designing additional internal primers. Three clones of each of DNA-A and DNA-B were
sequenced completely and one such clone of each
DNA-A and DNA-B was used for characterization of
the full genome. The restriction enzymes SacI and
EcoRV for DNA-A and HindIII and XbaI for DNA-B
were found to be unique cutters. The complete DNA-A
and DNA-B sequences are available in GenBank with
the accession numbers HQ264185 and HQ264186
respectively. The DNA-A and DNA-B components are
comprised of 2741 nt and 2698 nt respectively and their
genome organizations are identical to those of the previously characterized bipartite begomoviruses. DNA-A
contains six open reading frames (ORFs) of which two
ORFs AV1 and AV2 are in the virion sense and the

Page 5 of 13

other four ORFs, i.e., AC1, AC2, AC3 and AC4, are in
complementary sense. These ORFs are interspersed by
276 nt long intergenic region (IR) located between the
ORFs AC1 and AV2. The DNA-B component contains
two ORFs designated as BVI on the sense strand and
BC1 on the complementary strand. The DNA-A and
DNA-B genomes did not exhibit any sequence similarity, except for approximately 160 nt common region
(CR) which showed ~96.8% sequence identity with each
other. In the CR, a 34 bp potential stem-loop forming
region (5’-GCGGCCATTCGTATAATATTACCGAATG
GCCGCG-3’) was identified which includes the conserved nonanucleotide sequence TAATATTAC present
within the replication origin of almost all geminiviruses.
The nucleotide sequence comparison of complete
DNA-A of the virus isolate with the selected strains of
TOLCNDV, TYLCV and other begomoviruses reported
from India and worldwide (Table 1) showed highest
identity (97.6%) with ToLCNDV-IN[IN: UD: Ok: 07]
and lowest (87.9%) with ToLCNDV-IN[IN:ND:Pap:05]
(Table 2). We thus suggest the name of the variant as
ToLCNDV-India[India:Nagpur:Eggplant:2009] in accordance with the latest International Committee on

Information about the sequences used for comparison is provided in Table1

Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) guidelines for species
demarcation in the genus [1].
The nucleotide sequence analysis of DNA-B of the
ToLCNDV isolate under study with selected DNA-B
sequences of begomovirus in NCBI database showed
that it has highest sequence identity (94.1%) with
ToLCNDV-IN[IN:UD:Ok:07] and lowest with
ToLCNDV-IN[IN: Luck] (Table 2).
The phylogenetic tree analysis on the basis of nucleotide sequence of DNA-A genome of the ToLCNDV-IN
[IN:Nag:Egg:09] with the DNA-A sequences of other
selected begomoviruses revealed that the ToLCNDV-IN
[IN:Nag:Egg:09] isolate has close relationship with the
strains of ToLCNDV. In contrast, DNA-A nucleotide
sequences of begomovirus species associated with
EYMD in Thailand, showed divergent relationship with
ToLCNDV-IN[IN: Nag: Egg: 09] isolate (Figure 2). Phylogenetic analysis of the DNA-B genome also showed
that ToLCNDV-IN[IN:Nag:Egg:09] isolate has close relationship with ToLCNDV strains (Figure 3).
Infectivity of the cloned genomic components

To assess the infectivity of the present ToLCNDV isolate, agroinfectious constructs of both the genomes were

introduced into the leaves of tomato as well as eggplant
using the agro-infiltration technique. Agroinfiltration of
various constructs were carried out either individually
or in various combinations and the consequent disease
expressions are summarized in Table 3. When both the
genomic components (DNA-A and DNA-B) were coinfiltrated, typical yellow mosaic symptoms at 60 days
post inoculation (dpi) was observed in eggplants (5/5)
(Figure 4, panels C and G) and the same constructs
evoked typical downward leaf curling in tomato plants
(5/5) at 45 dpi (Figure 5, panels C and G). The symptoms persisted even at 150 and 180 dpi in eggplants and
tomato plants respectively.
To investigate the possible role of non-cognate DNAb satellite in the disease severity, we co-infiltrated the
dimeric clone of betasatellite, CLCuMB[IN:ND1:03]
along with both the genome-components of ToLCNDVIN[IN:Nag:Egg:09] on the test plants (eggplant and
tomato). The eggplants exhibited severe yellow mosaic
symptoms at 45 dpi (Figure 4, panels D and H) while
severe downward leaf curling was observed in tomato at
30 dpi (Figure 5, panels D and H).
The DNA-A genomic component failed to develop
disease either in eggplant or tomato when infiltrated
alone (Figure 4, panels A and E; Figure 5, panels A and
E). In addition, we were also interested to examine that
the DNA-B component of the ToLCNDV-IN[IN:Nag:
Egg:09] isolate could be replaced by non-cognate
CLCuMV DNA-b for systemic disease development. As
anticipated, co-infiltration of DNA-A and DNA-b
resulted in successful systemic disease development. The
symptoms were mild mosaic in eggplant (2/5) (Figure 4,
panels B and F) and leaf curling in tomato plants (3/5)
(Figure 5, panels B and F). Thus, non cognate CLCuMV
DNA-b substituted DNA-B of ToLCNDV-IN[IN:Nag:
Egg:09] for systemic viral movement in both eggplant
and tomato plants, albeit in a reduced manner. However, the disease expression period was prolonged compared to when the B-component was administered with
DNA-A. The symptom development periods were 90
and 80 dpi for eggplant and tomato respectively.
However, the severity of the symptoms was most pronounced when all of the three components, i.e., DNAA/DNA-B/DNA-b, were co-transferred in plants. Figure
4 shows the severity of yellow mosaic disease in eggplants and the leaves curled with progression of the disease (panels D and H). The disease expression time also
reduced to 45 days. Similar was the case with tomato
and the curled leaves showed mosaic symptoms eventually due to virus infection (Figure 5, panels D and H).
The disease also expressed early, i.e., at about 30 dpi in
tomato plants.
As expected, neither empty pGreen vector (negative
control) nor DNA-B and DNA-b construct caused any

symptoms in test plants even at 180 dpi and no noticeable phenotypic change in eggplant and tomato plants
were observed. In contrast, plants infiltrated with the
agroinfectious constructs were always stunted in growth.
The level of viral DNA accumulation in the diseased
plants

In order to know the level of viral DNA accumulation,
total DNA from systemic and symptomatic leaves of
agroinfiltrated eggplant and tomato plants was extracted
and subjected to semi-qPCR and RCA. RCA products of
high molecular weight were digested with EcoRV,
unique site in the DNA-A of ToLCNDV-IN[IN:Nag:
Egg:09]. The 2.7 kb band was observed only in plants
agro infiltrated with either both the genomic components or DNA-A with non cognate DNA-b. However,
no such band was observed in plants infiltrated with
only DNA-A (data not shown).
The semi-qPCR was carried out to know the level of
viral DNA accumulation in plants infiltrated with various
constructs. The results revealed that the viral DNA accumulation in tomato plants was highest when the plants

were infiltrated with all the three components, namely
DNA-A, DNA-B and non cognate DNA-b. The accumulation of viral DNA was lowest when the DNA-A and
DNA-b was used for co-infiltration (Figure 6A, C). Similar results were also obtained with eggplants (Figure 6B,
D). However, the effects of non cognate b DNA was less
pronounced in eggplants compared tomato.
The measured intensities of the 2.7 kb bands were
normalized with respect to the corresponding actin controls. The average normalized intensity values (based on
three independent studies) are presented as bar graphs
in Figure 6C, D. Our data reflect that the accumulation
of viral DNA increased to ~95% on introduction of non
cognate DNA b in tomato while there was a modest
increase of ~14% in eggplant. The accumulation of viral
DNA was further reduced up to ~27% when DNA-B
was substituted by non cognate DNA-b in tomato plants
whereas the same was ~50% in eggplant (Figure 6C, D).

Discussion
Eggplant is one of the preferred hosts for rearing of whiteflies and was known to be immune for begomovirus [31]

Figure 4 The disease was induced by ToLCNDV-IN[IN:Nag:Egg:09] in eggplants that were inoculated with different constructs as
labeled. The agro-inoculated plants are shown at the bottom panel and the corresponding representative leaves are shown in the top panel in

till the recent past. However, begomovirus causing EYMD
in Thailand have been identified [1,22] although, the etiology of the disease was not satisfied by Koch’s postulates.
Prominent yellow mosaic symptoms were observed on
eggplants in fields during 2009-2010 in Nagpur, India.
Virus like symptoms and infestation of whiteflies
prompted us to investigate the possible association of
begomovirus with the newly emerging disease of eggplant.
Our results confirmed the association of a begomovirus
with EYMD. Based on high nucleotide sequence identity
(97.6% for DNA-A and 94.1% for DNA-B) with the strains
of ToLCNDV, phylogenetic analysis and the demarcation
criteria in species demarcation[1], the begomovirus isolated from diseased eggplant is considered as a variant of
ToLCNDV and we suggest the name as ToLCNDV-IN
[IN:Nag:Egg:09].
ToLCNDV is an economically important pathogen
and found to be associated with various crop plants in
India, Pakistan, Thailand and Bangladesh [1].
ToLCNDV has been reported for the first time in
India from tomato and it required both DNA-A and

DNA-B for symptom development [2]. Later on, it has
been reported from various crops and weeds such as,
chili [32], cucurbits [33], potato [34], papaya[35], bittergourd [36], cotton (GenBank Accession number,
EF063145) and Solanum nigrum (GenBank Acc. No.
AJ620187). As already known, virus isolated from a
plant may or may not be the cause of disease unless it
satisfies the Koch’s postulates and despite a large host
range and geographical distribution of ToLCNDV, very
few cloned isolates have been shown to be infectious
to either experimental plants or the hosts from which
they were isolated.
Therefore, to satisfy the Koch’s postulates, the infectivity of ToLCNDV-IN[IN:Nag:Egg:09] was established
by infiltrating the agroinfectious clones in eggplant. The
agroinfiltration in eggplants resulted in the disease
symptoms that are similar to those occurred in the virus
infected eggplant in fields. Hence, we fulfilled the Koch’s
postulates and showed for the first time that
ToLCNDV-IN[IN:Nag:Egg:09] is responsible for the
newly emerging EYMD in central India.

Figure 5 Plants were inoculated with different constructs as labeled. Rest of the condition is same as described in Figure 4.

Interestingly, ToLCNDV-IN[IN:Nag:Egg:09] gave the
typical leaf curling symptoms, not the yellow mosaic in
tomato plants. Thus, these results also indicated that the
nature of symptoms and disease is largely a host-driven
process in this case. The successful virus infection is
dependent on productive interactions between viral and
host factors at each stage of the infection process and
host-adaptation have a different basis in different plants
[37,38].
On agroinfiltration with empty vector (taken as negative control) or only DNA-A of ToLCNDV-IN[IN:Nag:
Egg:09], no symptoms were recorded even by 180 dpi.
This showed that DNA-A alone of ToLCNDV-IN[IN:
Nag:Egg:09] was neither able to sustain nor produce systemic infection in the host plants. This phenomenon is
perhaps true for most of the geminiviruses with the
bipartite genomes [2,15].
The association of a DNA-b molecule with the field
infection of ToLCNDV-IN[IN:Nag: Egg:09] could
not be detected by either PCR or RCR method. Nevertheless, we still suspect that in succeeding time,

betasatellite associated monopartite begomovirus may
be identified with EYMD in southern India. Consequently, we used the non-cognate CLCuMB[IN:
ND1:03] molecule to examine its role in degree of
virus infection. When CLCuMB[IN: ND1:03] was coinfiltrated with DNA-A of ToLCNDV-IN[IN:Nag:
Egg:09], produced mild leaf curling in tomato plants.
This result suggested that CLCuMV DNA-b can successfully substitute the DNA-B for systemic movement
of ToLCNDV-IN[IN:Nag:Egg:09] and symptom development. These results are in conformity with the earlier findings that DNA-b can substitute DNA-B for
systemic movement [20]. However, the symptoms took
longer time to develop and they were mild comparative
to that when both the genomic components (DNA-A
and DNA-B) were present. It indicated that DNA-b
can substitute DNA-B up to certain extent but not
completely. These results are also in accordance with
the previous findings that, DNA-B plays the major role
in symptom production and viral pathogenicity in
bipartite begomovirus [39].

Eggplant

Figure 6 The plants (Tomato and Eggplant) were agro-infiltrated with various constructs as shown on the top of the figures, and the
level of viral DNA accumulation was checked by semi-qPCR at 90 dpi using DNA-A specific abutting primers ToLCNDV-IN[IN:Nag:Egg:
09]. The amplification products (~2.7 kb) were separated on 1% agarose gel and are presented in panels (a) and (b) for tomato and eggplant
respectively. The band intensities were quantified and the normalized values with respect to corresponding loading controls (ACTIN) are plotted
as bar graphs in panels (c) and (d) respectively. The standard deviations shown are based on three independent experiments.

The DNA-b satellite molecules are also known for
intensification of disease symptoms in a host dependent
manner [27,40]. Co-infiltration of DNA-A and DNA-B
of ToLCNDV-IN [IN:Nag:Egg:09] with DNA-b of
CLCuMV resulted in enhanced severity of disease in
both eggplant and tomato. The appearance of disease
symptoms also took lesser time compared to that
required by both DNA-A and DNA-B. Thus, our results
promoted the role of DNA-b in increasing the disease
severity[41].
The symptomatic variation with agroinfiltrated test
plants which were infiltrated with various combinations of constructs were corroborated with molecular
findings as the relative virus accumulation of virus
increased to about ~95% and ~14% in tomato and

eggplant respectively when DNA-b was infiltrated
along with both DNA-A and DNA-B. The value
reduced to ~27% and ~50% respectively in tomato and
eggplant when DNA-B was replaced with DNA-b,
where the value obtained for A+B was arbitrarily
assigned as 100%. Furthermore, these results support
the notion that DNA-b increases the disease severity
by increasing the accumulation of the helper virus.
The variation observed in tomato and eggplant may be
due to the fact that DNA-b increased the symptoms
severity in a host dependent manner [14,42].
Thus, we have identified and characterized the virus
associated with EYMD as a variant of ubiquitous
TOLCNDV, but presence of new begomoviruses species
with the eggplant cultivation in India cannot be negated

Pratap et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:305

as different species of monopartite and bipartite begomoviruses exist across India and among them many
monopartite begomoviruses with betasatellite molecules
are already known to be prevalent in southern India
[43]. The diversity of begomovirus may lead to adaptation of eggplants as a new host and as a result the eggplants in other part of India might be under severe
threat. Therefore, some practical intervention measures,
such as enforcement of quarantine regulations in the
trade of live plant materials and development of resistant plants are urgently needed to curb the viral threat.

Conclusion
Taken together, on the basis of molecular characterization and infectivity test, we can conclude that
ToLCNDV-IN[IN:Nag:Egg:09] is a newly emerging variant of ToLCNDV moving to a new economically
important host, eggplant and subsequently posing severe
constraint on eggplant production in India. This is also
a first experimental demonstration of Koch’s postulate
for a begomovirus associated with eggplant yellow
mosaic disease.
