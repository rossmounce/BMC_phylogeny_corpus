Abstract
Background: As in other vertebrates, avian hindbrain neural crest migrates in streams to specific
branchial arches. Signalling from Eph receptors and ephrins has been proposed to provide a
molecular mechanism that guides the cells restricting them to streams. In mice and frogs, cranial
neural crest express a combination of Eph receptors and ephrins that appear to exclude cells from
adjacent tissues by forward and reverse signalling. The objective of this study was to provide
comparative data on the distribution and function of Eph receptors and ephrins in avian embryos.
Results: To distinguish neural crest from bordering ectoderm and head mesenchyme, we have colabelled embryos for Eph or ephrin RNA and a neural crest marker protein. Throughout their
migration avian cranial neural crest cells express EphA3, EphA4, EphA7, EphB1, and EphB3 and
move along pathways bordered by non-neural crest cells expressing ephrin-B1. In addition, avian
cranial neural crest cells express ephrin-B2 and migrate along pathways bordered by non-neural
crest cells expressing EphB2. Thus, the distribution of avian Eph receptors and ephrins differs from
those reported in other vertebrates. In stripe assays when explanted cranial neural crest were
given the choice between FN or FN plus clustered ephrin-B1 or EphB2 fusion protein, the cells
strongly localize to lanes containing only FN. This preference is mitigated in the presence of soluble
ephrin-B1 or EphB2 fusion protein.
Conclusion: These findings show that avian cranial neural crest use Eph and ephrin receptors as
other vertebrates in guiding migration. However, the Eph receptors are expressed in different
combinations by neural crest destined for each branchial arch and ephrin-B1 and ephrin-B2 appear
to have opposite roles to those reported to guide cranial neural crest migration in mice. Unlike
many of the signalling, specification, and effector pathways of neural crest, the roles of Eph
receptors and ephrins have not been rigorously conserved. This suggests diversification of receptor
and ligand expression is less constrained, possibly by promiscuous binding and use of common
downstream pathways.

Background
A defining feature of vertebrates is the neural crest (NC), a
transient group of cells that originate within the dorsal
neuroectoderm of the neural tube during embryonic

development [1]. Following an epithelial to mesenchyme
transition in which they lose affinity for the neuroectodermal epithelium, NC cells individualize and gain the
capacity to migrate through the underlying mesoderm.

Hindbrain cranial neural crest (CNC) cells migrate ventrally to the branchial arches, where they contribute to the
development of the face, jaw, neck, and heart [2]. There
are 3 discrete streams of hindbrain CNC, each separated
by zones free of neural crest. The most rostral stream
extends from rhombomere 2 (r2) to the first branchial
arch; a second stream adjacent to r4 migrates to the second branchial arch; and the third forms a bifurcating
stream that extends from r6 to the third and forth
branchial arches. The patterning of the cranial neural crest
is distinct from the segmentation of the trunk neural crest,
where the patterning can be specifically attributed to differences between rostral and caudal halves of somites [3]
Eph family receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and their
membrane-anchored protein ligands, the ephrins, are
thought to regulate directed migration of CNC cells. In the
mouse embryo EphA4, EphB1, and EphB3 are expressed
by the streams of CNC cells, whereas ephrin-B2 is distributed around the clefts dividing each branchial arch [4].
When ephrin-B2 is mutated, these streams become scattered and CNC cells invade the regions where ephrin-B2 is
normally expressed. It is concluded that in CNC migration, ephrin-B2 functions primarily as a ligand to activate
Eph-induced forward signaling that guides migration
[4,5]. On the other hand, ephrin-B1 is expressed by the
migrating neural crest cells and when it is deleted only in
these cells, directional migration defects are apparent [6].
As a mutation in the PDZ binding domain of ephrin-B1
produces the same defects, it was concluded that in cranial
neural crest ephrin B1 acts as a receptor that activates a
PDZ mediated signaling cascade [6].
A number of Eph and ephrin genes are expressed in the
hindbrain region of the early chicken embryo [7-9]. Based
on these observations, we set out to determine which Eph
receptors and ephrins are expressed by neural crest and
which are expressed by the surrounding mesenchyme and
ectoderm. We have found that avian CNC cells express
Eph receptors and ephrin ligands, and an in vitro functional test indicates they can function in guiding migration. However, the roles of the ephrin-B1 and ephrin-B2
subunits are switched by comparison to those shown to
function in mice. We propose a mechanism by which
orthologues of Eph receptors and ephrins can become
canalized to different roles during evolution.

Results and Discussion
Co-localization of Eph/ephrin RNA and neural crest
Although Eph receptors and ephrins are known to be
expressed in the hindbrain and branchial arches, it is critical to developing a hypothesis for their functions to know
which Eph receptors and ephrins are expressed by neural
crest and which by surrounding head mesenchyme and
ectoderm. To do this, we employed double labeling in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/8/56

which Eph and ephrin expression patterns were evaluated
by RNA in situ hybridization and CNC cells were identified by double labeling with an antibody that recognizes
a NC antigen, HNK-1. Based on findings from previous
studies [7-9] as well as our own cloning experiments, we
focused our analysis on ephrin-A5, ephrin-B1, ephrin-B2,
EphA1, EphA3, EphA7, EphB1, EphB2, and EphB3. The
stages of development examined range from 11–15, during which most of the CNC cell migration in the chicken
embryo takes place [1]. Embryos probed with control,
sense transcripts developed only weak background staining or no color at all (data not shown). Analysis of the
CNC subpopulation associated with the first branchial
arch has been excluded due to technical problems with
resolving NC staining from staining in the hindbrain. We
were unable to detect expression of ephrin-A5 and EphA1
(data not shown).
Avian cranial neural crest cells express EphB3, EphA3, and
EphA7
EphA3, EphA7 and EphB3 mRNA localize to streams of
cells on either side of the otic vesicle. In the stage 14
embryos, one of these streams reaches from BAII to the
upper rostral face of the otic vesicle (Fig. 1a; arrow 1). A
second reaches from BAIII to the upper caudal face of the
otic vesicle (Fig. 1a; arrow 2). A third reaches from BAIV
to a point in the second stream around the lower level of
the otic vesicle (Fig. 1a, arrow 3). The HNK-1 antibody
identifies streams of cells that have an identical distribution to those labeled by the EphA3, EphA7 and EphB3
probes (Fig. 1b–f). At stage 12 and 13, the EphB3 probe
labels a stream of cells rostral to the otic vesicle. In these
earlier stages, probe also labels a stream of cells caudal to
the otic vesicle that appears to be the same streams before
they have diverged (data not shown).

In cross-section, EphA3, EphA7 and EphB3 probe is localized to a narrow band of cells in the mesenchyme underlying the ectoderm that reaches from the neural tube to
BAIII (Fig. 2a, c, d). HNK-1 staining has an identical distribution (Fig. 2b, d, f), and cells that are labeled by the
probe are also labeled by the HNK-1 antibody. These
results indicate that EphB3, EphA3, and EphA7 are all
expressed by avian CNC cells destined for BAII, BAIII, and
BAIV.
A subset of avian cranial neural crest cells express EphA4
and EphB1
RNA probes for Eph A4 and EphB1 hybridize most
strongly to cells in r3 and r5 (Fig. 3 inset). In stage 14
embryos, probe hybridizes to a streak of cells that curls
around the caudal margin of the otic vesicle and reaches
into BAIII (Fig. 3a, c). Probe staining appears to coincide
only with the stream of HNK-1-positive cells associated
with BAIII, but not the branch associated with BAIV (Fig.

3b, d). This pattern of probe staining is also seen in stage
13 and stage 12 embryos (data not shown). At stage 11,
r3/5 staining is prominent, but the post-otic vesicle stream
is not obvious.
Cross-sections reveal that EphB1 and EphA4 probes
hybridize to a long, narrow band of cells in the mesenchyme immediately underlying the ectoderm between the
neural tube and BAIII (Fig. 4a, c). HNK-1-positive cells
have an identical distribution, and EphB1 and EphA4
probes co-localizes with the HNK-1 antibody (Fig 4b, d).
From these results, we have concluded that CNC in the
avian embryo expresses EphB1 and EphA4, but this
expression is restricted to those cells that migrate to BAIII.

Ephrin-B1 is expressed by cells bordering the streams of
avian cranial neural crest
Ephrin-B1 probe hybridizes most prominently to the caudal halves of somites (Fig. 5a inset). In stage 15 embryos,
probe staining is also found in cells within BAII, and
staining is strongest in the arch (Fig 5a; arrow 1). This
region roughly corresponds to the same point where the
stream of HNK-1-positive cells rostral to the otic vesicle
comes to an end (Fig. 5b). Ephrin-B1 probe also hybridizes weakly to a thin, diffuse strip of cells that extends
from the caudal surface of the otic vesicle to the cleft
between BAII and BAIII (Fig. 5a, arrow 2). A second region
of diffuse staining is caudal to the otic placode and
extends to the first somite (Fig 5a, arrow 3). In combination, the boundaries of these 2 regions resemble an
inverted v (Fig. 5a, fine outline). Probe also hybridizes
weakly to a small circle of cells around the opening to
BAIV (Fig. 5a arrow 4). In co-localizations it is apparent

that the stream of HNK-1-positive cells caudal to the otic
vesicle is bracketed by ephrin-B1 probe binding cells (Fig.
5a–c, fine outline). Similar distributions are seen in
embryos at stages 12–14, although some probe binding
cells are not present before stage 14 (data not shown).
In cross-section, the ephrin-B1 probe binding cells are
concentrated within the ventral mesenchyme of BAII (Fig.
5d). The HNK-1 antibody binds to a band of cells distributed between the lower margin of the otic vesicle and the
opening of BAII (Fig 5e). These cells become diffuse ventrally as ephrin-B1 probe staining becomes prominent
within BAII. We have therefore concluded that ephrin-B1
has a distribution that for the most part, does not overlap
with CNC in the avian embryo and is expressed by cells
that border the pathways of CNC migration.

Avian cranial neural crest cells express ephrin-B2
Cells labeled by ephrin-B2 probe have a distribution similar to that of cells labeled by EphB3, EphA3, or EphA7
probe (Fig. 6a). In stage 14 embryos, ephrin-B2 probe
stains a stream of cells that spans from the upper rostral
face of the otic vesicle to BAII. A second reaches from a
point around the upper caudal margin of the otic vesicle
to BAIII. A shorter region of probe binding cells branches
off of this second stream around the lower level of the otic
vesicle and extends to BAIV. HNK-1 has an identical distribution in the same region (Fig. 6b). This pattern of
probe staining is also seen in the stage 13 embryos (data
not shown). At stage 12, probe stains a short stream of
cells rostral to the otic vesicle and a second caudal to the
otic vesicle (data not shown).

EphB2 is expressed by cells bordering the streams of avian

In the stage 15 embryos, EphB2 probe hybridizes weakly
to a narrow band of cells that extends dorsally from the
cleft between BAI and BAII, leaving a thin space of
unstained tissue next to the otic vesicle (Fig 7a; arrow 1).
Ventral to the otic vesicle, a broader band of probe staining is positioned over the cleft between BAII and BAIII
(Fig 7a, arrow 2). A third, roughly triangular patch of
labeled cells is found over the cleft between BAIII and
BAIV (Fig 7a, arrow 3). A region of probe staining caudal

to the otic vesicle extends to the first somite (Fig 7a, arrow
4). The BAII HNK-1 positive cells largely fill the region
between the otic vesicle and the boundaries of the EphB2
expressing cells (Fig 7a, b). The HNK-1 positive cells caudal to the otic vesicle occupy the spaces between the otic
vesicle and the regions expressing EphB2 that approximate the shape of an inverted y (Fig. 7a, b). Similar distributions are seen in stage 13 and 14 embryos (data not
shown).

In cross-section, the patch of EphB2 probe staining is in
the mesenchyme underlying the ectoderm proximal to the
neural tube (Fig. 7d). HNK-1 staining in the same section
appears in the mesenchyme in and around BAIV, distal to
the neural tube (Fig. 7e, f). Thus, HNK-1 is least concentrated where the EphB2 probe staining is most prominent.
Therefore, CNC cells in the avian embryo have distributions that for the most part do not overlap with EphB2,
and they appear to migrate along pathways bordered by
cells expressing this receptor.
However, there are differences in the expression patterns
for ephrin-B1 and EphB2 in non-neural crest cells. For
instance, ephrin-B1 expression is concentrated inside of
BAII (Fig. 5a, c), whereas EphB2 has a more dorsal distribution in the same region (Fig. 7a, c). Similarly, ephrin-B1
expression caudal to the otic vesicle is focused around the
dorsal half of the CNC stream in that region (Fig. 5a, c),
whereas EphB2 expression brackets the CNC more ventrally around BAIII and BAIV (Fig. 7a, c).

These data indicate that a suite of Eph receptors and
ephrin ligands are expressed in the hindbrain region of
the avian embryo during the course of CNC cell migration. RNA probes for EphA3, EphA4, EphA7, EphB1, and
EphB3 label segregated streams of HNK-1 expressing cells
that span the distance from the hindbrain to the branchial
arches. We have therefore concluded that avian CNC cells
express EphA3, EphA4, EphB1, and EphB3 and ephrin-B2.
These CNC streams are positioned between groups of
HNK-1-negative cells labeled by probes for ephrin-B1 or
EphB2. Thus, avian CNC cells migrate along pathways
bordered by cells expressing potential binding partners for
EphA3, EphA4, EphA7, EphB1, and EphB3 or ephrin-B2.
This led us to hypothesize that CNC cells in the avian
embryo are channeled into streams and guided to their
destinations by being excluded from ephrin-B1 or EphB2expressing territories.

Proteins that bind to ephrin-B1 and EphB2 are expressed
by avian cranial neural crest cells in vitro
In order to confirm that explanted avian CNC cells express
proteins that interact with ephrin-B1 and EphB2, we
exposed the outgrowth from cultured stage 10–12 hindbrain explants to affinity probes comprised of the extracellular domain of either ephrin-B1 or EphB2 fused to the Fc
domain of human IgG and then stained them with an
FITC-conjugated antibody specific for the Fc domain of
human IgG. In the control experiment, where cells were
exposed to the Fc domain of human IgG alone, cells colabeled with the HNK-1 antibody fail to bind the anti-Fc
antibody (Fig. 8a). Conversely, exposure to ephrin-B1/Fc
fusion protein results in HNK-1-positive cells showing
small, intense foci of anti-Fc staining around the cell

periphery (Fig. 8b). HNK-1 positive cells exposed to
EphB2/Fc also stain, but in this case it is fainter than with
ephrin-B1/Fc and most prominent at the interfaces
between adjacent cells (Fig. 8c). Thus, explanted avian
CNC cells bind ephrin-B1 and EphB2, consistent with our
localization data.
Avian cranial cells respond to ephrin-B1 and EphB2 in a
stripe assay
To test the functions of ephrin-B1 and EphB2 in avian
CNC migration, we performed a series of stripe assay
experiments with these proteins. In the control experiment, stage 10–12 hindbrain explants were cultured on a
substrate made up of lanes of FN alternating with lanes of
FN plus an FITC marker and Fc protein pre-clustered with

ments with EphB2/Fc, cell outgrowth also becomes
increasingly restricted to the lanes between the FITCmarked stripes with increasing substrate protein concentrations (2 to 64 μg/ml) (Fig. 9). The total cell outgrowth
in these experiments is comprised almost entirely of cells
labeled by the HNK-1 antibody (as revealed by DAPI
nuclear staining) (Fig. 9).
Outgrowth on the control substrate (64 μg/ml) has an
essentially even distribution, with 52% of cells being
found on the FITC stripes and 48% between them (n = 10)
(Fig. 10). Conversely, outgrowth is highly skewed on the
substrate containing lanes of ephrin-B1/Fc, with 15% of
cells being found on the FITC stripes and 85% between
them (n = 9). Outgrowth on the substrate containing
lanes of EphB2/Fc has a similar distribution, with 22% of
cells being found on the FITC stripes and 78% between
them (n = 9). The difference between the control and
ephrin-B1/Fc or EphB2/Fc results is significant (p <
0.0001), whereas the difference between the ephrin-B1/Fc
and EphB2/Fc results is not significant (p = 0.2745). We
have therefore concluded that HNK-1-positive cells growing out from avian neural tube explants in culture are
indifferent to Fc alone in the stripe assay, but avoid
ephrin-B1/Fc and EphB2/Fc strongly and to a similar
extent.

an anti-Fc antibody. Using Fc protein concentrations in
the coating solution ranging from 8 to 64 μg/ml, HNK-1positive cell outgrowth is always spread evenly across the
two sets of lanes (Fig. 9). In contrast, substrate protein
concentration has an effect on outgrowth pattern when
ephrin-B1/Fc is used in place of Fc in the stripe assay. At
32 μg/ml in the coating solution, the outgrowth is even
(Fig. 9). When coated with 48 μg/ml, outgrowth shows a
bias for the lanes between the FITC-marked stripes, but
there are also a significant number of cells found on these
stripes (Fig. 9). At 64 μg/ml in the coating solution, this
bias is much stronger and there are almost no cells found
on the FITC stripes (Fig. 9). In the corresponding experi-

Soluble ephrin-B1 and EphB2 mitigate the avoidance
response
To determine whether the responses observed in the stripe
assays are mediated by the Eph receptors and ephrin ligands expressed by CNC cells, we did the same experiments, but added soluble fusion proteins as competitors
(Fig. 11). In the first control experiment, stage 10–12 neural tube explants were cultured in the presence of soluble
Fc protein on a substrate composed of lanes of clustered
ephrin-B1/Fc plus FN and an FITC marker alternating with
lanes of FN alone. The resulting HNK-1-positive outgrowth is localized to the lanes between the FITC marked
stripes of ephrin-B1/Fc protein, such that there are almost
no cells on these stripes (Fig. 11). When the same experiment is done with soluble ephrin-B1/Fc added to the culture medium, there is a marked increase in the number of
cells on the lanes of substrate-bound ephrin-B1/Fc. In the
corresponding experiments with EphB2/Fc, there is a similar increase in the number of cells on the lanes of substrate-bound EphB2/Fc. With both sets of experiments,
the results from the control are similar to the assays in
which no soluble protein was added to the culture
medium. It should also be noted that soluble ephrin-B1/

When neural tube explants are cultured on the clustered

presence of soluble Fc protein, 10% of the outgrowing
cells are found on the FITC stripes while 90% are found
between them (n = 9) (Fig. 12). In the corresponding
experiment with soluble ephrin-B1/Fc, this distribution
shifts to 31% of the cells being found on the stripes and

pathways through which they migrate are bordered by
cells expressing ephrin-B1 or EphB2. Furthermore, while
the paradigm for Eph/ephrin function in directed cell
migration is that Eph-expressing migratory cells or outgrowing axons are guided to their targets by receptormediated repulsion from ephrin-expressing cells, our
results suggest that reverse signaling from Eph to ephrin
can also play a role. Thus, Ephs and ephrins can regulate
the path finding behavior of migrating avian CNC cells.

69% between them (n = 6). When explants are cultured
on the clustered EphB2/Fc plus FN and FITC versus FN
substrate in the presence of soluble Fc, 25% of the outgrowing cells are found on the FITC stripes while 75% are
found between them (n = 4). In the presence of soluble
EphB2/Fc, this distribution shifts to 39% of the cells being
found on the stripes and 61% between them (n = 7). The
difference between the absence and presence of soluble Fc
in the culture medium is not significant for either the
ephrin-B1/Fc (p = 0.03928) or EphB2/Fc (p = 0.7390)
experiments. For the soluble competitor assays, however,
the difference between the control and experimental treatments is significant for both the ephrin-B1/Fc (p =
0.0004) and EphB2/Fc (p = 0.0483) assays. These results
indicate addition of soluble forms of ephrin-B1/Fc and
EphB2/Fc interferes with CNC exclusion from substrates
coated with clustered ephrin-B1 EphB2.
These results indicate that ephrin-B1 and EphB2 can alter
the direction of migration of avian CNC cells. Addition of
soluble competitor resulted in a significantly more even
pattern of outgrowth than in controls, presumably
because the Ephs and ephrins expressed by the outgrowing cells were rendered less sensitive to the substratebound ephrin-B1 or EphB2 through their interactions
with the soluble proteins. Taken together, these results
indicate that avian CNC cells express proteins that bind to
ephrin-B1 and EphB2 and mediate the repulsion of these
cells from ephrin-B1 and EphB2 in the stripe assay.
This repulsion could explain how avian CNC cells are
guided to their targets in vivo, given that the stereotypical

A remarkable aspect of these studies is the differences that
are apparent within the vertebrates in the distribution of
hindbrain Ephs and ephrins (Table 1). Although data are
incomplete, it is apparent that the combination of Eph
receptors and ephrins expressed by the different populations of hindbrain neural crest varies between the classes
of vertebrates. Overall, hindbrain neural crest of mice,
chickens and frogs express similar subsets of Eph receptors
and ephrins, however, few of the receptors or ephrins are
expressed by precisely the same populations of neural
crest or bordering tissue. The patterns of hindbrain neural
crest migration are similar, yet the molecules that are in
part responsible for patterning the streams appear to differ. This is particularly striking with the data from mouse
and chick with respect to ephrin-B1 and ephrin-B2. In
mice ephrin-B1 is expressed by migrating CNC cells and
there is direct evidence that it functions as a reverse signaling receptor to regulate CNC path finding [6]. In chicks,
ephrin-B1 is expressed by mesoderm cells that border the
migratory pathways and it appears to function as a ligand
that mediates repulsion of migrating neural crest. Similarly, ephrin-B2 is expressed by all three streams of neural
crest cells in chicks, yet in mice ephrin-B2 functions as a
ligand and is expressed in tissues bordering neural crest
pathways [4]. Ephrin-B1 and ephrin-B2 appear to have
evolved opposite roles in guidance of chicken and mouse
embryos hindbrain neural crest.
Neural crest is a hallmark of vertebrates and many aspects
of neural crest development are shared features. There are
numerous examples of conservation of signaling pathways, transcription factors specification, and effectors
genes in vertebrate neural crest [10,11]. Reviews of neural
crest frequently do not distinguish data from fish, frogs,
birds, and mammals, as conservation of pathways and
regulatory networks in neural crest is commonplace [12].
Why do the critical roles of Eph receptors and ephrins in
guiding migration appear to be unconstrained by phylogeny? It may be that although there are multiple orthologous Eph receptors and ephrins, they bind promiscuously
and they activate similar effector pathways. Diversification of expression patterns then results from a process of
canalization in which similar receptor-ligand binding
partners activate similar downstream events making
migration independent of the precise receptor or ligand

expressed. For example, if ancestrally ephrin-B1 and
ephrin-B2 were both expressed by neural crest and head
mesenchyme and the downstream signal transduction
mechanisms were the same for both subunits, in one lineage expression of ephrin-B2 becomes fixed in neural
crest, whereas in another lineage expression of ephrin-B2

becomes fixed in bordering mesenchyme. It may be significant that in Xenopus ephrin-B2 is expressed by both BAII
neural crest cells and the mesoderm along the BAII pathway [13]. The hypothesis that the Eph receptors and
ephrins are interchangeable is supported by data on binding affinities of the subunits [14]. However it is not

known if similar signal transduction pathways are activated by orthologous Eph receptors and ephrins in different populations of neural crest. Comparative data on the
molecular mechanisms of hindbrain neural crest patterning has the potential to contribute to a more complete picture of vertebrate evolution.

We have shown that Eph receptors and ephrin ligands
contribute to avian hindbrain neural crest cell pathfinding, as is the case in mouse and Xenopus. Avian hindbrain
neural crest cells express a set of Eph receptors and migrate
along pathways bordered by cells expressing ephrin-B1. In
addition, avian CNC cells also express ephrin-B2 and
migrate along pathways bordered by cells expressing a
binding partner, EphB2. Our functional analyses show
that EphB2 and ephrin-B1 have repulsive effects on avian
CNC cells and suggest that these effects are mediated by
Ephs and ephrins. The pattern of expression of Eph receptors and ephrins by different populations of hindbrain
neural crest in vertebrates appears to be less constrained
phylogenetically than other neural crest signalling and
specification molecules. This may be a consequence of
diversification of receptor and ligand expression that was
unimpeded because of promiscuous binding affinities
and common downstream events.

Methods
4.1 Probe plasmids and RNA in situ hybridization
To prepare probes for EphB1 and EphB2, small blocks of
tissue bracketing the otic vesicle region were excised from
stage 13–15 embryos. Poly(A)+ mRNA was extracted from
this tissue with a MicroPoly(A) Pure kit (Ambion) and
first strand cDNA was generated from the mRNA with a
ProSTAR RT-PCR kit (Stratagene). Degenerate codehop
primers [15] designed against conserved protein
sequences of B-type Eph receptors, EphB-F1 (5'-CATCCTGGTGAACTCCAACCTNGTNTGYAARG-3') and EphB-R1
(5'-TGGATGTGGTTCAGGATCTTCTTYTGRTGNCC-3'),
were then used to amplify fragments of EphB receptors
from the first strand cDNA by PCR. These fragments were

cloned with a TOPO-TA Cloning kit (Invitrogen). Two of
the resulting clones were identified as fragments of the
chicken EphB1 and EphB2 genes. In a second round of
PCR, primers EphB1-F1 (5'-GAATTCGGATCTTCTTCTGGTGCCCA-3') and EphB1-R1 (5'-GAATTCGGATCTTCTTCTGGTGCCCA-3') were used to add EcoRI and PstI cut
sites to the ends of the EphB1 fragment. This reaction
product was subsequently cloned between the EcoRI and
PstI sites of pBluescript II SK +. Likewise, primers EphB2F1 (5'-CTCGAGTGGACAGCGCCTGAGGCAAT-3') and
EphB2-R1 (5'-ACTAGTGTTCAGAATTTTCTTCTGGT-3')
were used to add SpeI and XhoI sites to the EphB2 fragment so that it could be cloned between the same sites in
pBluescript II KS +.
To prepare probes for EphA3, EphA7, and EphB3, neural
tubes from stage 10–12 chicken embryos were isolated
and grown overnight in culture (see below). cDNA was
extracted from the neural tubes and their associated cell
outgrowths with a Cells-to-cDNA II kit (Ambion) and
used as template in PCRs with gene-specific primers. The
products from these reactions were cloned with a TOPOTA Cloning kit. Primers EphA3-F1 (5'-GTCGACCTGGGCACTTGCAAAGAG-3') and EphA3-R1 (5'-GGTACCGCCAGCATTACACAAGCAC-3') were used to amplify a
fragment of the chicken EphA3 gene that was subsequently subcloned between the BamHI and EcoRV sites of
pBluescript II SK +. Primers EphA7-F1 (5'-GAGCTCTACTACAAGAAGTGCTGGTC-3') and EphA7-R1 (5'-GGTACCGAGGACTCCACTCTAAACTC-3') were used to amplify
a fragment of the chicken EphA7 gene that was subsequently subcloned between the KpnI and SacI sites of
pBluescript II SK +. Finally, primers EphB3-F1 (5'GAGCTCCCTGCAAAGAGACCTTCAAC-3') and EphB3R1 (5'-GGTACCTTCATGGCTGGCTCGTAC-3') were used
to amplify a fragment of the chicken EphB3 gene that was
subsequently subcloned between the EcoRV and PstI sites
of pBluescript II SK +.
Plasmids containing chicken ephrin-B1 [16] and EphA4
[17] sequences (provided by E. Pasquale) were used as
templates in PCRs to isolate shorter fragments of the same
sequences. The products from these reactions were cloned
with a TOPO-TA Cloning kit. The ephrin-B1 fragment
amplified by primers ephrin-B1-F1 (5'-ATCGATGAGTGGGAAAGGGTTGGTC-3') and ephrin-B1-R1 (5-GTCGACGTTGTCTGCCTCCTTGCTG-3')
was
subcloned
between the ClaI and SalI sites of pBluescript II SK +. The
EphA4 fragment amplified by primers EphA4-F1 (5'GAGCTCTTCGTGGCATCGGCTCAGGA-3') and EphA4R1 (5'-GAATTCCTGGAGCTCTCGCTGCCTGT-3') was
subcloned between the EcoRI and SacI sites of pBluescript
II SK +.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/8/56

Plasmid containing chicken ephrin-B2 sequence was provided by K. Patel [18]. A PstI/SacI restriction digest fragment of this sequence was cloned between the same cut
sites in pBluescript II SK +.
Probe plasmids for chicken ephrin-A5 and EphA1 (also
known as EphA9) were provided by P. Antin [9].
RNA in situ hybridizations with chicken embryos ranging
from stage 11 to 15 were carried out essentially as
described by Streit and Stern [19].
4.2 Antibody labeling and sectioning after in situ
hybridization
Embryos stained by the in situ hybridization procedure
were incubated overnight at 4°C with HNK-1 primary
antibody (ATCC) diluted to 1:100 in a blocking buffer
containing 5% lamb serum. After being thoroughly
washed, the embryos were incubated overnight at 4°C
with Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-mouse secondary antibody
(Molecular Probes) diluted to 1:400 in blocking buffer.
Embryos exhibiting strong HNK-1 and probe labeling
after a final series of washing steps were prepared for sectioning by being embedded in OCT compound (Sakura)
and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. 10 μm cross-sections
were collected with a cryostat, placed onto gelatin-coated
slides, and rehydrated with a mounting medium comprised of 1:1 PBS and glycerol.
4.3 Cell culture
Neural tube explants were prepared following Newgreen
and Murphy [20]. Stage 10–12 chicken embryos were harvested in PBS and dissected to remove the extraembryonic
membranes, head, and tail, leaving a small block of tissue
around the otic vesicle. Tissue pieces were rinsed briefly,
transferred to a solution of 400 μg/ml Dispase I neutral
protease (Roche) in PBS, incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes, and then transferred to a 35 mm Petri dish flooded
with PBS containing 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS)
(Gibco). Using fine tungsten needles, the neural tubes
were gently teased away from the surrounding tissue,
including endoderm, ectoderm, somites, and head mesenchyme (whenever possible, the notochord was left
intact to mark the ventral surface of the neural tube). The
isolated neural tubes were rinsed briefly in a cell culture
medium consisting of D-MEM/F-12 with 100 units/ml
penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1 mM MEM sodium
pyruvate, 2 mM L-glutamine, 5% FBS (Gibco), and 1%
OPI media supplement (Sigma) and transferred in a single 100 μl volume of fresh medium onto an 18 mm glass
coverslip affixed to the center of a new 35 mm Petri dish
with a small drop of Matrigel (BD Biosciences). The Petri
dish contained an additional 900 μl of medium and the
coverslip had been acid-washed, pre-coated with 0.1%
(w/v) poly-L-lysine (Sigma) [21], and subsequently

coated with substrate proteins. After the neural tubes were
positioned on the substrate (ideally lying flat on one
side), 500 μl of medium was immediately withdrawn
from the dish to strand them in place. The dish was then
carefully transferred to a tissue culture incubator (5%
CO2, 37°C) and left undisturbed for 1 hour to give the
neural tubes a chance to adhere to the substrate, after
which the dish was topped up with 500 μl of fresh
medium and the neural tubes were left to incubate overnight.
4.4 Staining of cultured cranial neural crest cells with Fc
fusion proteins
The protocol used for staining cultured CNC cells with Fc
fusion proteins was adapted from Prin et al. [22]. Stage
10–12 neural tube explants were grown overnight in culture on a FN-coated coverslip. The next day, the neural
tubes and the cells that had grown out from them were
blocked with culture medium containing 1 mg/ml bovine
serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma) for 30 minutes in a tissue
culture incubator (5% CO2, 37°C). Following a brief
washing step with Ringer's solution, the cells were incubated for 1 hour at 4°C in fresh Ringer's containing 1 mg/
ml BSA and 10 μg/ml of the Fc domain of human IgG or
a chimeric protein made up of the extracellular domain of
mouse ephrin-B1 or EphB2 fused to the Fc domain of
human IgG (R&D Systems). The cells were washed, fixed
with 2% paraformaldehyde in Ringer's for 10 minutes,
and washed again. Finally, the cells were incubated with
FITC-conjugated anti-human IgG (Sigma) diluted 1:200
in Ringer's with 1 mg/ml BSA for 30 minutes, washed,
briefly incubated in DAPI nuclear stain in Ringer's (1 ng/
ml), and washed again. The stained cells were then prepared for imaging by being inverted onto a drop of
mounting medium on a microscope slide.
4.5 Preparation of stripe assay substrates
Stripe assay substrates were prepared with purified proteins as in Hornberger et al. [23] and Weinl et al. [24]. The
template matrix used for applying stripes of protein to culture substrates was supplied by S. Lang [25]. Ephrin-B1 or
EphB2 Fc fusion protein or Fc protein alone at the concentrations indicated in the results section was pre-clustered
for 1 hour with 10X anti-human IgG (Sigma) and 110 μg/
ml of an FITC marker conjugated to BSA (Sigma). A PolyL-lysine-coated coverslip was then firmly pressed onto the
stripe assay template and the Fc protein solution was
drawn into the channel system with a micropipette. After
1 hour in a tissue culture incubator (5% CO2, 37°C), the
channels were flushed with PBS and the coverslip was
gently removed from the template and affixed stripe side
up to the center of a 35 mm Petri dish with a drop of
Matrigel. The coverslip was then blanketed with a solution
of 50 mg/ml FN (Sigma) in PBS and left again for 1 hour
in a tissue culture incubator. Once neural tube explants

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/8/56

were ready to be transferred to the dish, the coverslip was
rinsed with PBS and the dish was flooded with 900 μl of
culture medium. The neural tube explants were positioned on these substrates such that they were perpendicular with the stripes.
For the soluble competitor experiments, soluble Fc proteins were added to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml after
the stranding step. With the ephrin-B1/Fc substrate, either
soluble ephrin-B1/Fc or soluble Fc alone was added. Likewise with the EphB2/Fc substrate, either soluble EphB2/Fc
or soluble Fc alone was added. The medium added to the
dish after the neural tube explants had been given time to
attach to the substrate also contained 10 μg/ml of soluble
Fc protein.
4.6 Antibody labeling and quantification of outgrowth
cultures on stripe assay substrates
Neural tube explant cultures that showed exuberant cell
outgrowth on stripe assay substrates after the overnight
incubation period were processed for immunolocalization of HNK-1. Cultures were rinsed with PBS and fixed in
ice-cold methanol for 10 minutes. Fixed cultures were
rinsed successively with PBS and TBST, then incubated in
blocking buffer (5% FBS in TBST). After 1 hour, the blocking buffer was replaced with HNK-1 antibody diluted
1:100 in fresh blocking buffer and the cultures were incubated in a humidified chamber at 4°C overnight. In some
cases where the signal from the FITC-BSA marking the Fc
protein stripes was weak, FITC-conjugated anti-human
IgG was also added (1:100 dilution) to make the stripes
more apparent. The next day, the cultures were rinsed
thoroughly with TBST and incubated with secondary antibody diluted to 1:400 in blocking buffer. After 90 minutes, cultures were again rinsed thoroughly with TBST and
incubated briefly with DAPI in TBST (1 ng/ml). The coverslip on which the explants were cultured was then gently
removed from the dish and inverted onto a drop of
mounting medium on a microscope slide.

For any given field of cell outgrowth, images were taken
for the HNK-1 and DAPI signals as well as the underlying
FITC-marked protein stripes. Layered composites of these
images were assembled in Adobe Photoshop 6.0.1
(Adobe Systems Inc.) such that the total HNK-1-positive
cell outgrowth was represented in each composite. The
HNK-1 layer was used to identify and remove HNK-1-negative cells (i.e. those cells labeled by DAPI alone) as well
as HNK-1-positive cells that were extensively intermingled
with HNK-1-negative ones. The remaining cells in the
DAPI layer were then divided according to their position
relative to the FITC-marked stripes, resulting in a set of
two images for each explant representing outgrowth on
the stripes and outgrowth between the stripes. Cell counts
were obtained with Image-Pro Plus (Media Cybernetics,

Inc.), converted to percentages of the total outgrowth,
averaged for each treatment, and graphed with GraphPad
Prism version 4 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Statistical
analyses (standard error calculations and Fisher's exact
tests) were done with GraphPad InStat (GraphPad Software, Inc.).

(Leica Microsystems) and Hamamatsu Orca-ER camera
(Hamamatsu Photonics) using Openlab 4.0.4 (Improvision Ltd.). Images were captured as tif files and imported
into Adobe Photoshop, where they were adjusted (e.g.
