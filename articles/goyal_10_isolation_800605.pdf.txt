Abstract
From April 2007 to March 2008, cloacal swabs were obtained from 246 casualty raptors recovered by various wildlife rehabilitation centers in the United States. The swabs were placed in a virus transport medium and transported
to the laboratory on ice packs. At the laboratory, the samples were pooled with each pool consisting of five samples. All pools (n = 50) were screened for the presence of avian influenza virus (AIV) using a real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR); one of the pools was found positive. All five samples in this pool
were tested individually by rRT-PCR; one sample from a bald eagle was found positive. This sample was inoculated
in embryonated chicken eggs for virus isolation and a hemagglutinating virus was isolated. Complete genome
sequencing of the isolate revealed a mixed infection with H1N1 and H2N1 subtypes. Further analysis revealed that
the PB1-F2 gene sequence of H1N1 virus had the N66S virulence-associated substitution. Further studies on ecology and epidemiology of AIV in raptors are needed to help understand their role in the maintenance and evolution of AIV.
Findings
Wild birds are considered natural reservoirs of avian
influenza virus (AIV) and at least 105 species of wild
birds have been reported to harbor these viruses [1].
The migratory nature of these bird populations may
help disseminate AIV across countries and continents.
Most of the wild birds have been reported to harbor
low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses [2-5]
although highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)
viruses have also been isolated from some species [6].
To understand how AIV is evolving in nature, it is
important to identify the AIV subtypes circulating
within wild bird populations.
A number of surveillance programs have been undertaken to isolate and identify the subtypes of AIV present
in wild bird species e.g., waterfowl and geese [3,7,8] with
limited reports in raptors. Thus, van Borm et al [9]
detected HPAI H5N1 in Thai eagles that were smuggled
into Belgium and Ducatez et al [10] isolated HPAI
H5N1 from vultures in Burkina Faso. Due to their carnivorous feeding habits, raptors may also play an important role in the spread of AIV. Some species of raptors

often feed on ducks and geese and if these birds are carrying AIV, raptors may pick up the virus and spread it
elsewhere. In this communication, we report on the isolation and characterization of two subtypes of AIV from
a single bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus).
From April 2007 to March 2008, under an NIH
funded surveillance program on avian influenza, cloacal
swabs were collected from 246 casualty raptors (bald
eagle-81, great horned owl-69, coopers hawk-62, turkey
vulture-28, and black vulture-6) recovered by various
wildlife rehabilitation centers in the U.S. The swabs
were collected in brain heart infusion broth containing
penicillin (500 IU/mL), streptomycin (500 μg/mL), neomycin (150 μg/mL), fungizone (1.5 μg/mL), and gentamicin (50 μg/mL). After collection, the swabs were
transported on ice to the laboratory in Saint Paul by
overnight shipping. At the laboratory, these samples
were stored frozen at -80°C until tested (within six
months of collection). The experimental plan was to
thaw the samples and pool them in pools of five samples
each followed by a matrix gene based real time reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) to
detect the presence of AIV [11]. From the positive
pools, individual samples were retested by rRT-PCR. All
individual samples positive by rRT-PCR were subjected
to virus isolation by inoculating them into 9-day-old

specific-pathogen-free embryonated chicken eggs (2 eggs
per sample) via the allantoic route. The inoculated eggs
were incubated at 37°C for four days after which they
were chilled and their allantoic fluids tested for hemagglutination (HA) using 0.5% chicken erythrocytes. RNA
was extracted from HA positive samples and from a
known AIV (H9N2) isolate using QIAamp viral RNA kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The RNA was tested for AIV in
a one-step RT-PCR using primers specific to the matrix
gene of AIV [12]. Amplified PCR products were separated by gel electrophoresis and a band of 1,027 bp indicated the presence of AIV. Complete genome
sequencing was undertaken using 454 pyrosequencing
recently developed in our laboratory [13] and the
sequences were analyzed for most closely related
sequences in GenBank.
One of the 50 pools was found positive for AIV by
rRT-PCR. All five cloacal samples in the positive pool
were then tested individually by rRT-PCR and a bald
eagle sample was positive. This sample was inoculated
in embryonated chicken eggs for virus isolation and a
hemagglutinating virus was isolated. Whole genome
sequence of this isolate was obtained using the 454-pyrosequencing technique that enables resolution beyond
what is possible by standard Sanger sequencing. Contigs
of all eight segments of influenza A virus were first
identified using GenAssembler software (454 Life
Sciences, Roche, Branford, CT) that detected two distinct hemagglutinin subtypes - H1 and H2 (GenBank
Accession nos. CY043315 - CY043330). Using standard
BLAST algorithm, GenBank databases were queried for
the most closely related isolates. Sequences of A/greenwinged teal/Ohio/430/1987(H1N1) (CY011040) and A/
mallard/Ohio/37/1986(H2N1) (CY021125) were homologous to those of the bald eagle isolate. Sequences of
all eight segments from these two subtypes were used as
a reference for subsequent alignments performed with
GenMapper (454 Life Sciences, Roche, Branford, CT).
The alignments yielded full genome sequences for two
subtypes, H1N1 and H2N1. This was further confirmed
by manual alignment of all contigs obtained from GenAssembler and GenMapper using Sequencher (Gene
Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI).
On further analysis, the matrix gene of H1N1 was
found to be more closely related to A/sanderling/DE/
1258/1986(H6N6). The nucleotides of HA and NA
genes of H2N1 subtype had 99% and 100% identity,
respectively, with those of A/mallard/Ohio/37/1986
(H2N1). The nucleotide identities between each segment of the two subtypes were also determined
(Table 1). One virulence-associated polymorphism in
PB1-F2 (N66S) was present in the H1N1 virus
(CY043317) [14].

All AIV subtypes (except certain H5 and H7 subtype
combinations) are considered to be LPAI in nature and
generally do not cause apparent disease in avian species.
Even infection with HPAI H5N1 is not fatal to some
waterfowl species [15]. Most of the surveillance studies
[3,4,7,8] have focused on the detection of AIVs from
waterfowl and shorebirds while only a few reports are
available on isolation of AIV from raptors. These
include reports on the isolation of H7 subtype from
saker falcon [16], crested hawk eagles [9], and wild
hooded vultures [10]. In addition, De Marco et al. [17]
reported serologic evidence of influenza A virus exposure in diurnal raptors in a rehabilitation facility. In the
winter of 2005-06, there were reports of H5N1-related
mortality among raptor species in Europe and Asia,
including eagle owls (Bubo bubo), buzzards (Buteo lagopus), and peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) (ProMED).
This is the first report on isolation of AIV in a Bald
eagle from the U.S. The bald eagle in question was
recovered from Gloucester County, Virginia in March,
2008. In general, samples from injured raptors are collected immediately after admission to the Rehabilitation
Center and before mixing with raptors already residing
at the Rehabilitation Center. These procedures were in
place when the bald eagle was brought to the Rehabilitation Center. In addition, the raptors residing at the
Rehabilitation Center were AIV negative, thus ruling out
the possibility of the bald eagle acquiring AIV infection
at the Rehabilitation Center.
The bald eagle, a bird of prey, is a protected and revered species in the US. In addition to fish, these birds
prey on ducks and geese [18], resulting in possible exposure to AIV. The AIV subtypes obtained from raptors
probably reflect the virus types present in its prey. The
raptors may also be infected from domestic poultry
especially in areas where dead poultry carcasses are discarded in the open or in the presence of open abattoir
systems. Though we do not know the role of raptors in
virus transmission to domestic poultry or wild birds at
present, such a possibility does exist. Since a large pool
of influenza subtypes circulates in waterfowl populations
[3,7], which are preys of raptors, further studies are
needed to determine the prevalence of different AIV
subtypes in raptors and their impact vis-a-vis transmission to domestic poultry directly or in a chain involving
raptors-waterfowl-domestic birds. Perhaps more importantly, raptors, especially eagles, may serve as sentinels
for influenza viruses circulating in the environment
from which they obtain their prey.
The genome sequences of this bald eagle isolate
revealed a mixture of H1N1 and H2N1 subtypes. Phylogenetic analysis identified a high degree of sequence
similarity of all segments of these two subtypes to
