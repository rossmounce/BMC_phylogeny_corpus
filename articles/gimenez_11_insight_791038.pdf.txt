Insight into cross-talk between intra-amoebal
pathogens

Abstract
Background: Amoebae are phagocytic protists where genetic exchanges might take place between amoebaresistant bacteria. These amoebal pathogens are able to escape the phagocytic behaviour of their host. They
belong to different bacterial phyla and often show a larger genome size than human-infecting pathogens. This
characteristic is proposed to be the result of frequent gene exchanges with other bacteria that share a sympatric
lifestyle and contrasts with the genome reduction observed among strict human pathogens.
Results: We sequenced the genome of a new amoebal pathogen, Legionella drancourtii, and compared its gene
content to that of a Chlamydia-related bacterium, Parachlamydia acanthamoebae. Phylogenetic reconstructions
identified seven potential horizontal gene transfers (HGTs) between the two amoeba-resistant bacteria, including a
complete operon of four genes that encodes an ABC-type transporter. These comparisons pinpointed potential
cases of gene exchange between P. acanthamoebae and Legionella pneumophila, as well as gene exchanges
between other members of the Legionellales and Chlamydiales orders. Moreover, nine cases represent possible
HGTs between representatives from the Legionellales or Chlamydiales and members of the Rickettsiales order.
Conclusions: This study identifies numerous gene exchanges between intracellular Legionellales and Chlamydiales
bacteria, which could preferentially occur within common inclusions in their amoebal hosts. Therefore it
contributes to improve our knowledge on the intra-amoebal gene properties associated to their specific lifestyle.

Background
Free-living amoebae are environmental protozoa, which
are important predators that contribute to the control
of microbial communities [1]. They feed by phagocytosing bacteria and other large, energy-rich particles that
are present in their environment [2,3]. Several microorganisms have adapted to become resistant to amoebal
phagocytosis and are able to escape the phagocytic pathway and multiply within phagocytic vacuoles [4]. Certain
bacteria that live naturally in amoebae have been proposed to be amoebal pathogens [5,6]. These organisms

are phylogenetically diverse and belong to Chlamydiae;
a, b and g-proteobacteria; and Bacteroidetes [7,8]. The
similarities in the strategies used by phylogenetically distantly related intracellular pathogens are most easily
explained by convergent evolution [9]. Recently,
Schmitz-Esser et al. [10] reported 59 functional domains
that are significantly enriched in amoeba-associated bacteria; half of these domains are more frequently associated with eukaryotic proteins. However, the genomic
characteristics associated with an intra-amoebal lifestyle
remain largely unknown.
To date, few bacterial genomes from natural pathogens of amoebae have been fully sequenced, including
those from (i) three strains of Chlamydia-related bacteria, i.e., “Candidatus Protochlamydia amoebophila”
[11], Parachlamydia acanthamoebae [12] and Waddlia
chondrophila [13]; (ii) five strains of Legionella pneumophila (Philadelphia, Lens, Paris, Corby, and Alcoy)
[14-17] and two strains of L. longbeachae [18]; (iii)

Rickettsia bellii [19];(iv) and a member of Bacteroidetes,
“Candidatus Amoebophilus asiaticus” [10].
Recently, the new Legionella species L. drancourtii,
initially named Legionella-like amoebal pathogen 12
(LLAP-12), was described within an Acanthamoeba sp.
[20]. This bacterial species, known to be a strict intracellular pathogen of amoebae, exhibits a genome that is
distinctly larger than its closest relatives, Francisella
tularensis and Coxiella burnetii [7]. Despite its strict
intracellular lifestyle, P. acanthamoebae exhibits a 3-fold
larger genome than members of the Chlamydia genus
[12] which includes human and animal pathogens that
do not grow in amoebae [21]. These characteristics contrast with the observed genome-size reduction that is
associated with the transition from a free-living to an
intracellular lifestyle [22,23]. It has been proposed that
the larger genome size might be linked to the sympatric
lifestyle of intra-amoebal bacteria and to gene exchange
among amoeba-resistant microorganisms inside the
amoeba or between these microorganisms and the
amoeba itself [7,24].
A major mechanism involved in genetic exchanges
between amoeba-resistant bacteria and their host is the
type IV secretion system (T4SS) [25,26]. This widespread system can be divided into three major subtypes:
those that mediate DNA transfer (F-like system), and
those that translocate proteins and nucleoprotein complexes (P- and I- like systems) [27]. All of the studied
genomes of intra-amoebal bacteria, including Legionellae, R. bellii and Pr. amoebophila, exhibit a T4SS of differing subtypes [14,15,17,19,28,29], except for W.
chondrophila, in which no such system has been identified [13]. Interestingly, a partial F-like conjugative system has been identified in the draft genome of P.
acanthamoebae [12].
In this study, we sequence the genome of the L. drancourtii strain LLAP-12 and compare it to the genome of
the P. acanthamoebae strain Hall’s coccus in order to
identify genes that could have been exchanged between
these two amoebal pathogens and, more widely, between
Chlamydiae and Legionellae.

2,809 predicted genes have an average size of 943 bp
and encompass 89% of the genome. The genome of
Legionella drancourtii and Parachlamydia acanthamoebae have been deposited in GenBank under accession
number ACUL02000000 and NZ_ACZE00000000,
respectively.
Orthologues identification

To identify orthologous genes that might have been
acquired by lateral gene transfer, proteins of P. acanthamoebae and L. drancourtii were subjected to reciprocal
BLASTP searches. A total of 508 orthologous proteins
were identified as exhibiting a reciprocal similarity percentage > 30% and an alignment length coverage > 60%
(Figure 1). Each orthologue was subjected to BLASTP
homology searches against one amoebal and six bacterial genomes and was considered present if it fulfilled
identical cutoffs for similarity and coverage. A clustering
analysis according to the presence or absence of the
orthologues in the different organisms was used to categorize the genes into eight different categories, as illustrated in the heatmap in Figure 2. The clustering of
bacteria in the horizontal top tree indicates that

Dirty genomes of L. drancourtii and P. acanthamoebae

Sequencing reads from L. drancourtii strain LLAP-12
obtained from 454 pyrosequencing were assembled into
213 contigs that were further organized into 58 scaffolds
(see Additional file 1, Materials). The genome had a
total size of 4,062,386 bp and a G+C content of 39%. A
total of 3,965 protein-coding ORFs with an average size
of 869 bp were identified and cover 84.7% of the genome. The published genome of the P. acanthamoebae
strain Hall’s coccus [12] comprises 93 contigs and has a
total of 2,971,261 bp with a G+C content of 38%. The

the identity (%) and coverage (%) of the query alignment that
results from a BLASTP search of P. acanthamoebae versus L.
drancourtii. Of the 1023 proteins showing reciprocal best blast hits,
508 exhibited a similarity greater than 30% and an alignment
coverage longer than 60% of the query (black) and were defined as
orthologues. Of the remaining 515 proteins (gray), 53 did not fulfill
the same criteria in the reciprocal analysis and, therefore were
discarded, although they appear on this figure as passing the
cutoffs. The correlation coefficient between both of the reciprocal
BLAST analyses was 0.97 and 0.80 for the percentage identity and
the percentage coverage, respectively.

Figure 2 Gene clusters. Orthologous genes were subjected to BLASTP against seven other organisms, colored in gray and black when using
Parachlamydia and Legionella proteins as queries, respectively. Genes were clustered according to their presence (gray) or absence (black) in the
six related bacteria and the amoebal species, D. discoideum. The genes form 8 major groups at a height of 3 (A to H).

consistent results were obtained when using P. acanthamoebae or L. drancourtii orthologues as queries against
the other genomes. Cluster A consists of core genes that
are present in nearly all bacteria. Clusters B and C

represent core genes generally absent in C. trachomatis
and/or R. baltica but respectively absent and present in
the amoeba Dictyostelium. The absence of an ortholog
in C. trachomatis is likely due to the genome reduction

that arose in the Chlamydia genus, whereas the absence
of an ortholog in R. baltica might reflect the divergence
of the species. The remaining clusters are made of differently conserved genes. Genes in cluster D are mainly
present in Pr. amoebophila, L. pneumophila, and in C.
burnetii. The small cluster E contains genes mainly present in Pr. amoebophila. Genes in cluster F are mostly
present in L. pneumophila, C. burnetii and R. baltica
and to a lesser extend in E. coli. Cluster G is formed of
two subsets: one subset of genes absent from all compared genomes, and another subset containing genes
present in Pr. amoebophila and E. coli. Cluster H mainly
represents genes encoded by the gamma-proteobacteria
and the amoeba Dictyostelium but absent from Chlamydiales and Planctomycetales. The genes were classified
according to the number of hits obtained against each
of the six bacterial genomes used (Table 1).
Conservation of orthologous genes

Core gene identification: Of the 508 orthologues, 208
were found in the genomes of Pr. amoebophila, C. trachomatis, R. baltica, L. pneumophila, C. burnetii, and E.
coli (score 6; super-cluster A in Figure 2 and Additional
file 2, Table S1). Of these orthologues, 92 coding
sequences (44%) were considered essential genes [30]
and, notably, encode for 32 ribosomal proteins and 11
tRNA synthetases. In addition, 80 genes were present in
five of the six screened genomes (score 5; Additional file
3, Table S2), of which 13 (16%) belonged to the minimal gene set. These sequences included 9 ribosomal
proteins and 3 tRNA synthetases due to their borderline
values for identity and alignment coverage. Of these 80
coding sequences, 26 (33%) were absent from the C. trachomatis genome, reflecting the important genome
reduction that has occurred in this bacterial clade, especially among genes encoding for metabolic functions (12
genes belong to COGs C, E, F, G or H). In addition, 38
genes (48%) were absent from the R. baltica genome,

probably as a result of its greater phylogenetic distances
to Parachlamydia and Legionella than the other bacteria
screened. Only 9, 6, 1 and 0 genes were missing in the
genomes of C. burnetii, E. coli, Pr. amoebophila and L.
pneumophila, respectively. Finally, 77 genes were present in four of the six studied genomes (score 4; Additional file 4, Table S3) and 4 of them (5%) belonged to
the minimal gene set [30]. All of the coding sequences
with a score of 4 or above were considered to be common genes found in most bacteria and were therefore
not further investigated for potential HGT.
Accessory orthologues: Of the 143 remaining genes, 59
were identified in three screened bacterial species (score
3; Additional file 5, Table S4). There was no obvious
logical pattern of distribution among the bacteria
because no genes were common to the three amoebal
pathogens included in the analysis (L. pneumophila, C.
burnetii, and Pr. amoebophila), and only ten coding
sequences were common to g-proteobacteria (L. pneumophila, C. burnetii, and E. coli). Moreover, bacteria
belonging to the Chlamydiae-Planctomycetes superphylum (Pr. amoebophila, C. trachomatis, and R. baltica)
encoded for no common gene in this category. Thirtyseven orthologues exhibited homologues in two species
(score 2; Additional file 6, Table S5). Unsurprisingly, L.
pneumophila contained 76% of these genes indicating its
close phylogenetic distance to L. drancourtii. In contrast, none of these genes were found only in bacteria
belonging to the Chlamydiales order (Pr. amoebophila
and C. trachomatis), while 12 genes were only found in
bacteria belonging to the Legionellales order (L. pneumophila and C. burnetii).
In addition, 27 genes harbored similarities to a single
species (score 1; Additional file 7, Table S6): L. pneumophila (15), E. coli (8) or Pr. amoebophila (4). Finally, as
visualized in Figure 2 (cluster G), 20 genes were only
present in P. acanthamoebae and L. drancourtii (score
0; Additional file 8, Table S7). Only one of these was

This table indicates the total number of proteins with a score of 0 to 6 based on their presence in the six bacteria when using P. acanthamoebae or L. drancourtii
orthologous proteins as queries for the BLASTP searches. The number of corresponding genes present in each bacterium is detailed in the following columns.
The bacteria in the first three columns are decreasingly related to L. drancourtii, andthose indicated in the last three columns exhibit diminishing relatedness to
P. acanthamoebae.

also present in D. discoideum: a conserved protein of
unknown function that was also encoded only in the
Corby strain of L. pneumophila and not in the Paris
strain of L. pneumophila that was used in BLAST analyses. Interestingly, this category included an operon for
histidine biosynthesis, which was composed of four
genes (378, 379, 442, and 443), that was only found in
P. acanthamoebae and the recently sequenced W. chondrophila [13] but not in the more closely-related Pr.
amoebophila. The corresponding genes in L. drancourtii
were encoded at two different genomic regions and the
four genes exhibited divergent phylogenies that render
an acquisition of the entire operon from Legionella
implausible.
Horizontal gene transfers

To identify potential gene transfers, the 143 genes with
scores of 0 to 3 were subjected to phylogenetic reconstruction using the 20 best BLAST hits from each P.
acanthamoebae and L. drancourtii orthologues. The
topology of the trees deviated from the expected taxonomic distribution of representatives from the Chlamydiales and Legionellales orders in 37 cases that are
detailed in Table 2. Overall, both P. acanthamoebae and
L. drancourtii genes clustered together in 7 phylogenies
(Additional file 9, Figure S1). Interestingly, four of these
genes (ID 127, 128, 129, and 130) were organized in an
operon that encodes for a permease and a membrane
anchored ATP-binding protein of an ABC-2 type transporter, an HlyD family secretion protein and an outer
membrane efflux protein (Figure 3). Similar systems that
are widespread among gram-negative bacteria such as E.
coli, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa
form a specialized secretory system for proteins, such as
pore-forming toxins, proteases, lipases and S-layer proteins [31]. Among the six bacteria screened, a partial
operon was found only in E. coli, where the first three
coding sequences had strong homologues, but the
fourth gene encoding for the outer membrane efflux
protein exhibited a homologue at a more distant locus.
Notably, the tree topology was similar for all of these
proteins (Figure 3) suggesting that the entire operon
was exchanged between L. drancourtii and P. acanthamoebae in a single event.
L. drancourtii never clustered with several members of
the Chlamydiales order. However, P. acanthamoebae
branched with the Legionellales clade in 10% of the
trees (15/143) (Additional file 10, Figure S2 A-O). A
good example of this clustering is a hypothetical protein
(ID 247), where P. acanthamoebae clustered with a
branch containing Francisella and two Legionella species, suggesting that a transfer occurred before the
divergence of the Legionella and Francisella genera. In
three additional instances (ID 400, 422, and 466), P.

Page 5 of 14

acanthamoebae clustered specifically with L. pneumophila and far from other Legionellales (Additional file
10, Figure S2 P-R) suggesting a transfer between these
two species. These genes were located on different contigs and encoded a permease, an HlyD family protein
belonging to an ABC-transporter, and a putative transcriptional regulator. An example of a protein wrongly
considered only to be present in L. drancourtii and P.
acanthamoebae is an acetyltransferase (ID 191) that has
a borderline similarity value of 29.4% with L. pneumophila. In fact, the corresponding gene was found in several members of the Rickettsiales order (Rickettsia,
Wolbachia, and Orientia), in Legionella species and in P.
acanthamoebae. We hypothesize that this protein’s presence in Parachlamydia results from a HGT with an
ancestor of the Legionellales order.
Furthermore, the Legionellales and Chlamydiales
orders were directly related in the tree that was inferred
from four genes (ID 90, 207, 263, 282) that encode for a
multidrug resistance protein, a 7-dehyrocholesterol
reductase, a protein that protects DNA during starvation
and a conserved hypothetical protein, respectively
(Additional file 11, Figure S3). The gene involved in the
protection against oxidative stress (dpsA, ID 263) presented a particular topology. A phylogenetic tree
inferred from an analysis with the 20 best BLAST hits
indicated that this gene was recently exchanged between
Rickettsiales and Legionellales and that an exchange
between Legionellae and Chlamydiae had occurred earlier (Figure 4). Notably, two different copies of this gene
were also present in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus,
one of which branched closely to Chlamydiales, suggesting an exchange with an ancestral Chlamydiae, and
another copy clustered with other cyanobacterial genomes and b-proteobacteria.
The phylogenetic analysis identified 9 cases of potential
gene transfer between P. acanthamoebae or L. drancourtii
and Rickettsia, Orientia, Wolbachia and Ehrlichia (Additional file 12, Figure S4). Of these cases, five genes (ID
243, 263, 387, 388, and 390) may have been horizontally
transferred between L. drancourtii and Rickettsia, including a beta-lactamase (ID 243). The analysis of the ID 387encoded hypothetical protein clustered P. acanthamoebae,
Legionellales and Orientia together. The close relationship
between L. drancourtii and Orientia suggests a transfer to
the latter species (Figure 5). The tree of the aminoglycoside transferase (ID 388) illustrates a complex situation
where all of the intracellular bacteria were grouped in a
single cluster, suggesting a common ancestral source for
this gene. The ATPase and permease subunits of an ABCtype transporter (ID 390) exhibited the remarkable phylogenetic pattern of being nearly exclusive to intracellular
species. However, this tree exhibited an atypical configuration that showed no monophyly among Legionella and

restricted to one hit per bacterial genus. Sequences retrieved using L. drancourtii or P. acanthamoebae as the query in a BLAST homology search
are tagged with an LLAP or PAH prefix, respectively. Sequences belonging to the best BLAST hit for both orthologues harbor both prefixes. All
of the proteins encoded for in the operon exhibit a similar phylogenetic tree, which shows a clustering of P. acanthamoebae and L. drancourtii,
thereby supporting the hypothesis of a single transfer event for all four genes.

Parachlamydiaceae. Indeed, L. drancourtii clustered with
L. pneumophila str. Paris and Parachlamydia, whereas
another gene from L. pneumophila clustered with Protochlamydia. This topology suggests the presence of multiple paralogues within the L. pneumophila genome. We
hypothesize that duplication events first occurred in L.
pneumophila and that one paralogue was subsequently
horizontally transferred to Protochlamydia and another
paralogue to Parachlamydia. Finally, the tree for a proton/
sodium-glutamate symport protein (ID 134) suggests an
exchange between Chlamydiales and an ancestral Rickettsiales (Figure 5).

In three cases (ID 207, 240 and 458), similarity searches
retrieved eukaryotic proteins matching L. drancourtii
and P. acanthamoebae proteins, including a 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase and a conserved hypothetical protein (ID 207 and 240, respectively) from L. drancourtii
that seem closer to eukaryotes than to bacteria with the
exception of L. longbeachae and a pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 alpha subunit (ID 458) (Additional file 13, Figure
S5). Interestingly, BLAST searches with the 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase retrieved a protein from the
amoeba Naegleria gruberi that clusters with L. drancourtii in the phylogenetic tree. In a recent study, this gene

hits shows the clustering of proteins from Rickettsia with Legionella species and, to a lesser extent, with Parachlamydiaceae and Synechococcus, a
cyanobacterium. Sequences retrieved using L. drancourtii or P. acanthamoebae as the query in a BLAST homology search are tagged with an
LLAP or PAH prefix, respectively. Sequences belonging to the best BLAST hits for both orthologues harbor both prefixes.

was proposed to have been acquired from viridiplantae
[32], but this earlier phylogenetic reconstruction did not
include Naegleria. Finally, two widely conserved
enzymes (ID 288 and 289, respectively) that encode for
a malate synthase and an isocitrate lyase are syntenic in
both genomes. A phylogenetic reconstruction with their
twenty best BLAST hits and amoebae showed that the
malate synthase of L. drancourtii clustered with Dictyostelium discoideum, suggesting a gene exchange from a
Legionella ancestor to amoebae, as previously reported
[33].
The genomes of L. drancourtii and P. acanthamoebae
harbor respectively 45 and 8 insertion sequences (ISs), a
number probably underestimated due to the likely presence of such elements in gaps of the genomic
sequence. One IS of type ISNpu13 is located 2000 bp
upstream the gene LGD_5795 (ID 246) that encodes an
acetyltransferase. There were no ISs close to other genes
identified as potentially acquired by HGT (Table 2).
The genomic nucleotide composition, notably the GC
content and codon usage, varies widely among the
organisms. As a consequence, regions that were
exchanged recently present an imprinting with the
donor’s characteristics. However, mutational pressures
tend to adapt the compositional features of foreign

DNA to that of its host over time, thus making the
transferred region indistinguishable [34]. In our analysis,
the GC content of the 37 genes suspected to have been
acquired by HGT based on phylogeny did not show a
marked difference in the GC content compared to the
rest of the Parachlamydia or Legionella genes (Additional file 14, Figure S6). The mean GC content for
Parachlamydia and Legionella is respectively 38.5% and
39% for all genes and, more precisely, 33.7% and 32.6%
at the third codon position, which is less constrained for
the conservation of amino acid properties. An interesting case was the operon that encodes an ABC transporter that showed the highest GC content, exhibiting
values between 41% and 45% in P. acanthamoebae. In
contrast, the GC content of this operon in L. drancourtii
was less distinguishable from the mean gene GC values.
This finding suggests that P. acanthamoebae acquired
this operon by HGT with a partner that has a higher
GC content than L. drancourtii.
Most exchanged genes encode poorly characterized
functions represented by COG category R. However,
several genes that belong to the overrepresented categories R, V, M and P encode putative functions linked
to the transport of various molecules and resistance to
toxic compounds.

Figure 5 Potential gene transfers with members of the Rickettsiales order. The bayesian trees for each orthologous gene (ID 387, 388, 390,
and 134) and their 10 best BLAST hits show the clustering of Chlamydiales and Legionellales with members of the Rickettsiales order. The retrieval
of BLAST hits was restricted to one per bacterial genus for (A), (B), and (D) but not for (C). Sequences retrieved using L. drancourtii or P.
acanthamoebae as the query in a BLAST homology search are tagged with an LLAP or PAH prefix, respectively. Sequences belonging to the best
BLAST hits for both orthologues harbor both prefixes.

Discussion
In this study, the genes in the draft genomes of P.
acanthamoebae and L. drancourtii were compared; we
identified 508 orthologues, which were subsequently
searched for in increasingly distantly related organisms.
Although limited by the small number of related organisms that we used to define conserved core genes and
less-conserved genes, our approach allowed us efficiently
to discard 72% of the orthologues that are widespread
within bacteria. The remaining 28% of the genes were
submitted to phylogenetic reconstructions, which
enabled us to detect 7 putative HGTs between P.
acanthamoebae and L. drancourtii. In addition, 18 genes

were potentially transferred from Legionellales to P.
acanthamoebae, whereas no genes were transferred
from Chlamydiales to L. drancourtii. As expected, half
of these potential HGTs encode for transporters and
resistance mechanisms that could be of particular
importance for the bacteria to resist to the microbicidal
defences of its amoebal host and to survive with high
concentrations of toxic compounds. The remaining
HGTs encode for metabolic functions or members of
poorly characterized protein families. Their importance
and their role regarding the amoebal pathogenicity of L.
drancourtii and P. acanthamoebae remain to be
determined.

We acknowledge the fact that the stringent reciprocal
identity and coverage cut-offs constitute one major limitation of this method, as they may falsely classify some
genes as absent from one of the selected related species
when they are, in fact, present. Genes that were probably acquired by HGT showed a large distribution in
their percentage of identity, ranging from 30% to 71%,
but they all exhibited an alignment coverage greater
than 80% indicating that a more stringent criterion
could have been used (Additional file 15, Figure S7).
The phylogenetic reconstructions enabled us to pinpoint
such cases because closely related sequences were
retrieved by BLAST searches. One major cause of these
false negatives are borderline values in one of the variables, as highlighted for the previously mentioned acetyltransferase (ID 191), in which the percentage identity
was 29.3%, and the coverage 81%.
Another bias may stem from the sequencing technology (454/Roche Genome Sequencer) and the gene prediction method used for both genomes; other
approaches may have been used in the other six genomes screened. A particular example is the case of two
orthologues (ID 48 and 49) that correspond to a single
gene that was artificially split in two different coding
sequences. After manual visualization of the sequencing
data from both genomes, it appeared that frameshifts
were caused by two homopolymer errors due to the
sequencing technology at similar positions in the two
bacteria. This artificially split gene encodes an ATPdependent Clp protease (ClpB) that is, in fact, present in
three species: L. pneumophila, C. trachomatis and Pr.
amoebophila, although it was considered to be absent
from the six genomes screened.
In addition, a number of proteins that are considered
orthologues in L. drancourtii and P. acanthamoebae do
not share a common history. In these cases, BLAST
searches retrieved proteins from completely different
organisms and the phylogenies clearly showed a divergent history, with the Parachlamydia and Legionella hits
being grouped in distinct clusters (e.g., ID 301, Additional file 10, Figure S2). The phylogenies exhibiting
this topology are easily identifiable and, therefore, do
not cause a bias in the results. One option to avoid misidentifying orthologues would have been to perform a
BLAST comparison versus the non-redundant database
and to assign orthology only if the gene occurred within
the best BLAST hits.
We did not identify any gene transfers from Chlamydiales to L. drancourtii. However, this finding may be
due to the limited number of genomic sequences from
Chlamydia-related bacteria available in the non-redundant database. Indeed, most published genomes belong
to the family Chlamydiaceae, which includes bacteria
that are highly adapted to their non-amoebal eukaryotic

Page 10 of 14

hosts and exhibit small genomes that typically range
from 1 Mbp to 1.2 Mbp. Additionally, the Chlamydiales
order presents a biphasic developmental cycle the relatively inactive extracellular form is surrounded by a
highly cross-linked extracellular matrix [35] that might
relatively non-permissive to genetic exchanges. The
replicating form, possessing a larger size and reduced
extracellular matrix, might be more permeable to such
exchanges that should subsequently arise within the
host inclusion. The ability of Chlamydia-related bacteria
to grow within amoebae would thus facilitate gene
exchanges with other amoeba-infecting microorganisms.
This hypothesis would be strengthened by in vitro evidence of co-localisation in amoebae of P. acanthamoebae, or any other amoeba-resistant chlamydiae, with
Legionella.
Ogata et al. [19] suggested that gene exchanges among
amoeba-resistant bacteria are an important mechanism
for triggering the evolution of intracellular microorganisms. The recent analysis of the Amoebophilus asiaticus
genome identified a large prevalence of gene transfer
events among amoeba-resistant bacteria [10]. In our
study, several phylogenies indicated possible HGTs
between amoeba-associated bacteria (Legionella and
Parachlamydia) and arthropod-associated bacteria, such
as Rickettsia, Orientia, Wolbachia, and Ehrlichia. The
presence of these genes in insect and arthropod endosymbionts suggests the possibility of intra-insect transfer
because the Chlamydiales order also comprises the genera Fritschea and Rhabdochlamydia, which feature
members that can infect arthropods [36-39]. Thus, as
proposed by Thomas et al. [40], gene exchanges might
be a common mechanism in intracellular bacteria that
exhibit a sympatric lifestyle and may occur not only
between amoebal symbionts but also between those
found in arthropods. In addition, we identified a significant BLAST match with Mimivirus, a large amoebainfecting virus, for a hypothetical protein (ID 404),
thereby supporting the hypothesis that intra-amoebal
viruses are also capable of genetic exchanges with other
microorganisms found in this environment [7].
In most cases, the Legionella or Parachlamydia proteins were largely diverged from their closest neighbors,
suggesting that the gene transfers were evolutionarily
ancient events. The inclusion of the best BLAST hits vs
NR in the phylogenetic reconstruction identified the
putative partner of transfer among all available
sequenced genomes. As an example, the phylogenetic
reconstruction of the PEBP family protein (ID:208) clustered L. drancourtii with the amoebal symbiont Amoebophilus asiaticus (Table 2). Due to the lack of
sequenced genomes in species closely-related to L. drancourtii or P. acanthamoebae, the direction of the transfer and the period of exchange relative to bacterial

Gimenez et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:542
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/542

speciation cannot be unequivocally established. There is
no strong evidence for recent HGT events that can
enable us to pinpoint the exact partners of the transfer,
and an intermediate host that has not been sequenced
yet might be implicated in the future.
No genes were surrounded on both sides by IS but,
since no recent HGT was identified, insertion sequences
might have diverged over time sufficiently to impair
their identification. The close GC content values
between the L. drancourtii and P. acanthamoebae species and the large divergence in the GC content among
genes prevent us from confirming gene exchanges
between these two partners by this method. Moreover,
the large range of GC content within a bacterial order
makes the use of this measure difficult for discriminating a potential origin of transfer because the phylogenetic tree usually shows distant relationships between
our candidate partners.

Conclusion
This study presents a first genome-scale analysis that
provides evidence for numerous HGT that occurred
among three major intra-amoebal bacterial phyla. Moreover, this article reports a new genome of an amoebal
pathogen, L. drancourtii, that opens new possibilities for
the investigation of such important horizontal transfer
events and provides data for researchers interested in
the biology of this species. With the availability of additional genome sequences, a complete study of all
sequenced intra-amoebal genomes would be of large
interest and will bring in the future a more complete
picture of gene exchanges occurring between amoebaresistant microorganisms. As previously suggested [7],
the amoebae probably have a major role in bringing
amoeba-associated microorganisms close enough to
facilitate genetic exchanges. The occurrence of HGT
between intra-amoebal pathogens is of importance,
since such gene exchanges may play an important role
in the selection of bacteria able to resist both the amoebae and other phagocytic cells such as the macrophages,
which thus represent good candidates as new pathogens
Methods
Study design

To study the occurrence of gene transfer between amoebal pathogens, we sequenced the genome of the L. drancourtii strain LLAP-12 and compared it to the draft
genome of the P. acanthamoebae strain Hall’s coccus.
Details on the dirty genome sequencing method used
for L. drancourtii are provided with the Supplementary
Materials (Additional file 1). After identifying orthologous genes present in both the L. drancourtii and P.
acanthamoebae genomes, we searched for homologous
genes in six bacterial genomes and one amoebal

Page 11 of 14

genome, as detailed below. The presence or absence of
every orthologue in each clade was used to infer a heat
map and a score. The corresponding clusters were
investigated in more details. In addition, selected genes
were compared by BLAST [41] to the non-redundant
(nr) GenBank database and subjected to phylogenetic
analyses.
Identification of conserved genes

To identify genes that were present in both L. drancourtii and P. acanthamoebae, we performed BLASTP comparisons between both genomes and the best reciprocal
hits were retrieved if they exhibited a similarity > 30%
and a query and hit length coverage > 60%. These conserved genes were searched for in one amoebal genome
(Dictyostelium discoideum AX4 [NC_007087NC_007092], the only fully sequenced amoebal genome
available to date) and six bacterial genomes with a
decreasing degree of phylogenetic relatedness respectively to L. drancourtii and P. acanthamoebae. Model
organisms or medically important bacteria were selected
within the same family (Legionella pneumophila Paris
[NC_006368], respectively Pr. amoebophila UWE25
[NC_005861]), within the same order (Coxiella burnetii
RSA 493 [NC_002971], respectively Chlamydia trachomatis D/UW-3/CX [NC_000117]) and within the same
phylum (Escherichia coli K12 substr. MG1655
[NC_000913.2], respectively Rhodopirellula baltica SH1
[NC_005027]). Each gene was considered present if it
exhibited > 30% identity and had a length coverage >
60% on both the query and hit. The genes were classified according to the number of hits obtained using P.
acanthamoebae or L. drancourtii as the query against
each of the six bacterial genomes based on a score of 0
(no hits in any f the screened genomes) to 6 (hits in all
of the screened bacterial genomes).
Gene clustering and the definition of core genes

Hierarchical clustering was performed based on the
Euclidean distance of the presence or absence of each
gene in the studied genomes. Using the H-clust function
(an in-house R script), super clusters were defined at a
dendrogram height equal to 3. The clusters were represented on a heat map drawn using an in-house R script
[42]. Core genes were defined as any gene present in at
least 4 of the 6 screened genomes (score ≥ 4) and were
not further analyzed.
BLAST and phylogenetic analyses

A BLASTP search against the nr database http://blast.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi was performed for genes with
scores between 0 and 3. For each gene, a phylogenetic
analysis was conducted with the 20 best BLASTP hits of
P. acanthamoebae and L. drancourtii that was restricted

Gimenez et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:542
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/542

to one representative species per genus. Sequence alignment was performed using Muscle [43]. Phylogenetic
relationships among species were inferred with PhyML
(PHYlogenetic inferences using Maximum Likelihood)
[44] using the WAG model. For particularly interesting
cases, a phylogeny based on a Bayesian inference was
performed using MrBayes [45] on alignments curated by
Gblocks [46].
Identification of lateral gene transfer

Genes exhibiting a topology different from that expected
for core genes were classified according to one of the
five following topologies: i) P. acanthamoebae genes
clustering with L. drancourtii; ii) P. acanthamoebae
genes clustering with Legionellales; iii) Legionellales
genes clustering with Chlamydiales; iv) P. acanthamoebae and/or L. drancourtii genes clustering with Rickettsia, Ehrlichia and Wolbachia and (v) genes matching
eukaryotic proteins by BLAST homology searches.
To characterize further the genes exhibiting an unexpected phylogenetic topology, their GC content was
examined relative to the genomic mean with R [42]
using the seqinR package [47]. A BLASTN comparison
was achieved versus ISfinder [48] with an e-value of 1e5 to search for insertion sequences in the genomes of L.
drancourtii and P. acanthamoebae.
