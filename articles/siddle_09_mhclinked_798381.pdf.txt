Abstract
Background: MHC class I antigens are encoded by a rapidly evolving gene family comprising classical and
non-classical genes that are found in all vertebrates and involved in diverse immune functions. However,
there is a fundamental difference between the organization of class I genes in mammals and non-mammals.
Non-mammals have a single classical gene responsible for antigen presentation, which is linked to the
antigen processing genes, including TAP. This organization allows co-evolution of advantageous class Ia/
TAP haplotypes. In contrast, mammals have multiple classical genes within the MHC, which are separated
from the antigen processing genes by class III genes. It has been hypothesized that separation of classical
class I genes from antigen processing genes in mammals allowed them to duplicate. We investigated this
hypothesis by characterizing the class I genes of the tammar wallaby, a model marsupial that has a novel
MHC organization, with class I genes located within the MHC and 10 other chromosomal locations.
Results: Sequence analysis of 14 BACs containing 15 class I genes revealed that nine class I genes, including
one to three classical class I, are not linked to the MHC but are scattered throughout the genome.
Kangaroo Endogenous Retroviruses (KERVs) were identified flanking the MHC un-linked class I. The
wallaby MHC contains four non-classical class I, interspersed with antigen processing genes. Clear
orthologs of non-classical class I are conserved in distant marsupial lineages.
Conclusion: We demonstrate that classical class I genes are not linked to antigen processing genes in the
wallaby and provide evidence that retroviral elements were involved in their movement. The presence of
retroviral elements most likely facilitated the formation of recombination hotspots and subsequent
diversification of class I genes. The classical class I have moved away from antigen processing genes in
eutherian mammals and the wallaby independently, but both lineages appear to have benefited from this
loss of linkage by increasing the number of classical genes, perhaps enabling response to a wider range of
pathogens. The discovery of non-classical orthologs between distantly related marsupial species is unusual
for the rapidly evolving class I genes and may indicate an important marsupial specific function.

Background
Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I antigens are responsible for the recognition of pathogenic
peptides and form a complex gene family, which can vary
in gene number and organization between different species. Although the function of class I genes varies, the
structure of the functional molecule nearly always consists
of an alpha chain divided into three extracellular domains
(α1, α2 and α3), a transmembrane and cytoplasmic
region and an associated β2 microglobulin [1].
Class I genes are classified according to function as classical (class Ia) or non-classical (class Ib). Class Ia genes are
responsible for pathogen recognition, and perform this
function by binding endogenous foreign peptides and
presenting them to cytotoxic T-cells on the surface of the
cell. Class Ia molecules are ubiquitously expressed and the
genes are highly polymorphic within the α1 and α2
domains, where peptide interaction occurs [2], consistent
with their role in pathogen recognition. Although the
number of class I genes found in different species can vary
significantly, the number of expressed class Ia genes in
eutherian mammals is reasonably consistent, varying
between two to three [3] (the Rhesus macaque is a possible exception [4]). Some non-mammals have only one
highly expressed and polymorphic class Ia gene [5,6],
while others have multiple class Ia genes [7].
Class Ib genes are related in sequence identity and molecular structure to the class Ia genes, but have lower expression levels, tissue specific expression, low levels of
polymorphism and often lack consensus residues important for peptide binding found in class Ia molecules [8].
Human class Ib genes (HLA-G, HLA-E, and HLA-F) do not
play a prominent role in presenting antigens to T-cells, but
have a variety of roles both related and unrelated to
immune function. They interact with natural killer (NK)
cells as part of the innate immune response [9,10] and are
involved in regulation and suppression of the immune
system [11,12]. The number of class Ib genes can vary significantly between species, even between eutherian mammals. Humans have three class Ib genes, while mice have
over 30 [13]. Little is known about class Ib genes outside
eutherian mammals, however, several class Ib sequences
have been described in avians [14], amphibians [15] and
one class Ib sequence has been described from a marsupial, the grey short-tailed opossum (Monodelphis domestica) (herein referred to as opossum) [16].
Class I genes evolve rapidly through gene duplication and
divergence [17]. Due to their rapid evolution, class I genes
have undergone species specific expansions and, unless
the evolutionary relationship between species is very close
(ie human and chimp), orthologous relationships
between the class I genes of different species are difficult
to detect [18,19]. Human and mouse last shared a com-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/310

mon ancestor ~80 million years ago and orthologous relationships between their class I genes are not obvious, even
where the function of the genes is homologous.
MHC class Ia genes are found within the MHC region of
all species studied to date, however, their organization
within the MHC can vary between different species. In
non-mammalian species, the MHC class I and class II
genes are interspersed with the antigen processing genes
(eg TAP) [20-23], which are responsible for transporting
peptides from the cytoplasm into the endoplasmic reticulum, where they can be bound by class I molecules. It has
been suggested that this ancestral organization of the
MHC facilitated the co-evolution of advantageous class Ia
and TAP haplotypes that conferred resistance to specific
pathogens [20,21]. This organization may have provided
a selective advantage to non-mammals with only one
class Ia gene as duplication of class Ia would disrupt the
co-evolution of TAP and class Ia alleles [21,24]. A single
class Ia gene has been identified in the chicken MHC (B
locus) [20] and the MHC of Xenopus [25]. However, multiple class Ia genes have been described in detail within
the quail MHC [7]. It has been suggested that there are
multiple class Ia genes in other non-mammalian species,
including the axolotl, but number and organization of
genes has been estimated without genome sequencing
[26].
In the majority of eutherian species the class Ia genes are
separated from the TAP genes by the class III region and
are interspersed with the framework genes. The rat is an
exception and has similarities with non-mammals, as the
class Ia genes are linked to antigen processing genes [27].
The framework genes are found within the MHC of all
mammals and are highly conserved in gene function and
order. It is thought that the repositioning of class Ia genes
away from the antigen processing genes and transportation genes prevented the tight co-evolution of class Ia and
TAP alleles, but also released constraints on the number of
class Ia genes, allowing duplication of class Ia in eutherian
mammals [21].
While the class Ia genes are found within the MHC region,
class Ib genes have been found outside the MHC in a
number of mammalian and non-mammalian species. In
Xenopus and chicken, class Ib genes have been identified
that are not linked to the MHC [15,28]. A more extreme
case is that of the class I-like genes CD1, which are
encoded outside the MHC in mammals and are very divergent in sequence and function to the class Ia and class Ib
[29]. The relocation of class Ib genes away from the MHC
in these examples is believed to have loosened the constraints on their evolution allowing the genes to evolve
independently, without influence of gene conversion
events [30] and co-evolution of closely linked genes [24].

Studies have shown that the organization of the marsupial
class I genes in the opossum (Monodelphis domestica) has
similarity to both mammalian and non-mammalian patterns [31]. The class I are interspersed with the antigen
processing rather than the framework genes, an organization similar to non-mammals. The opossum has three
closely related class I genes that are polymorphic and
highly expressed, however, only one class I gene, ModoUA, has been classified as class Ia as the two closely related
class I (Modo-UB &Modo-UC) are located outside the MHC
and are not expressed at the same level as Modo-UA. The
opossum also has six additional putative class Ib genes
with unknown functions that are located within the MHC
[31]. Class I genes do not localize to a single complex in
two marsupials (the opossum and tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii) [31,32]. Two expressed class I genes (ModoUB &Modo-UC) are located distal to the MHC at the end
of the chromosome in the opossum, while in the tammar
wallaby class I genes are MHC un-linked across six different chromosomes.
The tammar wallaby is an Australian marsupial used as a
model for studying the unique mode of marsupial reproduction, where young are born after a short gestation
period with no immune protection and undergo their
development in a pouch. Marsupials are particularly useful for studying the evolution of immune genes in mammals as they last shared a common ancestor with
eutherian mammals ~150 million years ago and fill an
evolutionary gap in the vertebrate phylogeny between
non-mammals and eutherian mammals [33]. A greater
understanding of the immune genes of this species will
allow comparisons to be made with the opossum, which
last shared a common ancestor with the wallaby ~80 million years ago [34] and is the only marsupial for which the
MHC has been fully annotated.
Here we report the sequencing of 14 tammar wallaby
BACs containing 15 class I genes. Four BACs are located
within the MHC proper on chromosome 2q while nine
BACs localize to different chromosomes. We show that
the class Ib genes remain linked to the MHC on chromosome 2q and are interspersed with the class II and antigen
processing genes, while the class Ia genes have MHC unlinked across the genome.

Results
Summary of sequenced BACs
Fourteen BACs containing class I genes were sequenced
and 15 class I genes with open reading frames have been
annotated (summarized in Figure 1, Additional file 1 provides a list of genes found on each BAC). The 15 class I
genes described in this manuscript are named Maeu-UA
through to Maeu-UP based on the nomenclature for class
I genes proposed by Klein and colleagues [35]. The nam-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/310

ing scheme does not indicate orthology to other known
marsupial class I genes, with the exception of Maeu-UM
and Maeu-UK (see below). The class I genes have 48 –
88.4% amino acid identity to each other across the α1, α2
and α3 domains. The open reading frames of the class I
genes vary from 342 to 363 codons.
Previously, we reported the isolation (but not sequencing) of nine tammar wallaby BACs containing class I
genes that mapped to every autosome with the exception
of chromosome 2, where the MHC class II and class III
genes are located [32]. In this study four additional BACs
containing class I genes were isolated and localized to the
MHC region on chromosome 2. Six class I genes were discovered on the BACs that map to chromosome 2. These
genes intersperse with antigen processing genes (PSMB8,
PSMB9, TAP1B, TAP2B) and the class II gene (DMB). Nine
class I genes with complete open reading frames were
found on the BACs, which map outside the MHC to 9
chromosomal locations.
The BACs which map outside the MHC also contain class
I pseudogenes, identified due to frame shift mutations,
absence of a start codon, or gene fragmentation, but not
other genes that are usually encoded within the MHC.
One possible exception is the presence two olfactory
receptor genes found on MeKba_282L16 (chromosome
6p) along with Maeu-UB. A cluster of olfactory receptor
genes is also found adjacent to the framework genes in
eutherian mammals and the opossum [31,36], however,
further analyses of these genes is required to determine
the relationship of these olfactory receptors to the MHClinked olfactory receptor genes in other species.
There are two distinct groups of class I genes in the
tammar wallaby
The wallaby class I genes form two distinct groups, MHClinked class I genes (Maeu-UE, UL, UK, UM, UO and UP)
and MHC un-linked class I genes (Maeu-UA, UB, UC, UD,
UF, UH, UI, UJ and UN). The MHC un-linked class I genes
have greater amino acid identity to each other than to the
six class I genes linked to the MHC, sharing on average
85% nucleotide identity with each other and 63% identity
to the MHC-linked class I genes. There is one exception:
Maeu-UP, located on chromosome 2, shares 72–75%
nucleotide identity with the MHC un-linked class I genes
and 61–67% identity to the MHC-linked class I genes. The
MHC-linked class I genes share features of their amino
acid sequence, including a deletion of varying size in the
α1 domain between residues 59 and 66 (Additional file 2:
Amino acid alignment of tammar wallaby class I genes,
opossum class I genes and HLA-A) and a short intron
between the α1 and α2 domains (data not shown), compared to the MHC un-linked class I genes.

its location. Red arrows indicate class I genes with open reading frames, blue arrows indicate non-class I genes with open reading frames, grey arrows indicate pseudogenes, green arrows indicate KERV sequences. A full list of genes and co-ordinates can
be found in Additional file 1.

The MHC un-linked class I genes group together (clade 1),
in a phylogenetic analysis, while MHC-linked class I genes
on chromosome 2q form a separate and distinct clade
(clade 3) (Figure 2). Again, Maeu-UP is an exception,
occupying the basal position in clade 1. Although the
position of Maeu-UP is not well supported using neighbour joining (Figure 2) or Bayesian analysis (Additional
file 3: Phylogenetic tree showing divergence times for tammar wallaby class I genes and Additional file 4: Phylogenetic tree produced for BEAST analysis) both methods
produced trees with the same topology. Clade 1 also contains previously identified expressed class I transcripts
from the Australian marsupials including the red-necked

wallaby (Macropus rufogriseus), brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula), Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) and
tammar wallaby. Opossum class I sequences, including
the Modo-UA (class Ia) and Modo-UG (class Ib) form a sister clade (clade 2) to the MHC un-linked tammar wallaby
class I genes. Interestingly, clade 3 contains the tammar
wallaby MHC-linked class I genes (Maeu-UE, Maeu-UO,
Maeu-UK, Maeu-UM and Maeu-UL), two class I sequences
isolated from the brushtail possum(Trichosurus vulpecula)
and the majority of the opossum class Ib sequences. This
clade is basal to the opossum class Ia sequences and MHC
un-linked tammar wallaby class I sequences.

The MHC-linked class I genes have characteristics of nonclassical class I genes
Six MHC-linked class I genes were identified, Maeu-UK,
Maeu-UM, Maeu-UE, Maeu-UL, Maeu-UP and Maeu-UO.
Four of these genes are expressed and have characteristics
of class Ib genes, Maeu-UK, Maeu-UM, Maeu-UE and
Maeu-UO. Gene specific primers were used to amplify
each of these genes from the wallaby thymus and no more
than two alleles was amplified for each primer set, suggesting the primers are gene specific. No expression was
detected for Maeu-UP or Maeu-UL. Three of the MHClinked class I genes were found to have tissue specific
expression, Maeu-UM, Maeu-UE and Maeu-UL. Expression
of Maeu-UM was found in wallaby lung, spleen and thymus, and transcripts of Maeu-UE and Maeu-UO were only
detected in the thymus (Figure 3). Maeu-UK was widely
expressed, found in all tissues examined, with the exception of skin (liver, testes, lung, kidney, gut, skin spleen
and thymus tissue (Figure 3).

Maeu-UK, Maeu-UM, Maeu-UE and Maeu-UO sequences
were amplified from four wallabies of Kangaroo Island
origin (I1, I2, I3 and I4. Again, no more than two alleles
per gene were amplified from each individual (Table 1).
The amplified alleles of Maeu-UK, Maeu-UM, Maeu-UE
and Maeu-UO lacked variation at the peptide binding
region with only a maximum of one non-synonymous
substitution between the identified alleles of each gene.
Comparison of the level of polymorphism in these genes
with the only other characterized marsupial class Ib,
Modo-UG, revealed a similar level of polymorphism
(Table 1).

MHC-linked class I genes in the tammar wallaby appear
marsupial specific
The topology of the phylogenetic tree clearly separates the
opossum and Australian marsupial class I sequences of
clades 1 and 2 from the class I sequences in clade 3. Rather
than forming species specific clades, as is the norm of class
I genes, the class I genes in clade 3 include class Ib genes
of the tammar wallaby, brushtail possum and the opossum. Within this clade, two wallaby class I genes MaeuUM and Maeu-UK are clearly orthologous to the opossum
class Ib genes, Modo-UM (bootstrap of 100) and Modo-UK
(bootstrap of 100). No orthologs for Modo-UE and ModoUL were discovered in the wallaby, however, three closely
related class Ib genes, Maeu-UE,UL and UO were identified and cluster with Modo-UE and Modo-UL in clade 3.
One of these genes, Maeu-UO, does have an orthologue in
the brushtail possum.
The MHC un-linked class I genes have characteristics of
classical class I
Nine MHC un-linked class I genes were found throughout
the genome, three of these genes have characteristics of
class Ia genes. Evidence of expression was found for seven
of these genes, while two are either pseudogenes or have
such low levels of expression that transcripts were not
detected. A number of lines of evidence indicate that
seven of these genes are expressed and that three are
highly expressed and have a classical function. First, class
I transcripts sequenced from blood and thymus samples
identified from a number of individuals are most similar
to MHC un-linked class I genes Maeu-UA (chr 7), MaeuUB (chr 6), Maeu-UC (chr 1), Maeu-UD (chr 5), Maeu-UF
(chr 4), Maeu-UH (chr 4) and Maeu-UN (chr 5) in a phylogenetic tree (Additional file 5: Phylogenetic relationship
between expressed class I transcripts and genomic class I
genes). Between 7 and 13 sequences were isolated from
every individual, indicating that at least seven class I genes
are amplified, although assignment of sequences to loci
was difficult due to high levels of sequence similarity and
a level of polymorphism observed in the peptide binding
region. The majority of transcripts sequenced from the
blood and thymus samples were most similar to MaeuUA, Maeu-UB and Maeu-UC. Class Ia genes have high levels of expression compared to class Ib genes and are more
easily isolated from the transcriptome, thus the class I
transcripts most readily isolated are most likely to be the
class Ia genes. No transcripts showing high similarity to
Maeu-UI and Maeu-UJ were identified suggesting that
these loci may not be expressed. However, it cannot be
ruled out that these genes are expressed at very low levels
and not detected here. Transcripts similar to the class Ib
genes on chromosome 2 are not amplified with these
primers. Second, previously identified expressed class I
genes isolated from Australian marsupials, including the
red-necked wallaby, possum and Tasmanian devil, have a
close relationship to the MHC un-linked wallaby class I

genes. The majority of these class I genes are thought to be
class Ia genes, in particular Saha-I*01 [37,38]. Finally, the
promoter elements of the MHC un-linked class I genes are
identifiable and highly similar in sequence identity to the
promoter regions of class Ia genes in the opossum (ModoUA) and eutherian mammals, while the promoters of the
putative class Ib genes are more divergent (see detailed
analysis below).
Promoter elements of class I genes
Putative class I promoter elements were identified within
200 base pairs of the start codon for the class I genes and
included TATA and CAAT sites, the S, X and Y regulatory
motif, an interferon stimulated response element (ISRE) and
an enhancer A site (Figure 4). The promoter elements of the
MHC un-linked class I genes are highly similar to each other,
sharing between 66–95% nucleotide identity in the 290 base
pairs upstream of the gene start site. The promoter elements
of the MHC un-linked class I are also similar to the regulatory elements of Modo-UA, sharing 57–70% nucleotide identity. However, Maeu-UJ is missing a TATA site and appears to
have a truncated enhancer A element and Maeu-UH and
Maeu-UI have no enhancer A element. These variations may
account for the lack of evidence of transcription of Maeu-UJ
and Maeu-UI. The upstream sequence of the class Ib, MHClinked class I genes shared between 32–50% nucleotide
identity with the MHC un-linked class I, 35–79% with one
another and only 39–51% with the promoter sequence of
Modo-UA, consistent with the more divergent nature of the
coding sequence of these genes. However, it was still possible
to identify the TATA, CAAT and SXY motifs in these genes,
with the exception of Maeu-UK and Maeu-UP. Putative
enhancer A and ISRE elements of the class Ib genes were
identified with less confidence due to the lower sequence
identity in the upstream sequence observed for these genes.

BACs. One full length KERV sequence was identified on
chromosome 5p, adjacent to Maeu-UN. This KERV
sequence had 90.6% nucleotide similarity to a previously
described full length KERV (KERV-1) [39]. Numerous partial KERV sequences were identified at 1p, 3q, 4p, 5q and
6p and 7p (shown in Figure 1). The partial KERV
sequences varied in length from 290 base pairs to 514
base pairs and shared between 67% and 99% nucleotide
identity to the full length KERV on chromosome 5p. No
significant matches to KERV were found within the BACs
on chromosome 2.
Molecular dating of class I gene relocation
Molecular dating was used to determine approximate timing of the repositioning of class I genes away from the
MHC in the tammar wallaby. The molecular dating performed in this study is treated as an estimate only as it
does not take into account that MHC class I and class II
genes evolve at a faster rate than neutral evolution would
predict, due to balancing selection [40]. Maeu-UP is
located within the MHC on chromosome 2 and is the
most similar MHC-linked class I in sequence identity to
the MHC un-linked class I genes. It is found at the base of
clade 1, which contains putative classical class I
sequences. Using a Bayesian approach for molecular dating (see Methods), the MHC un-linked class I genes and
Maeu-UP last shared a common ancestor ~86–140 mya.
Maeu-UN on chromosome 5q3, the most basal MHC unlinked class I gene was the first class I gene to move away
from chromosome 2, ~65–107 mya. The subsequent
duplication of class I genes and their repositioning to different chromosomal positions most likely occurred from
this location with the most recent duplications and relocation occurring 15–38 mya.

wallaby has 15 class I genes, 11 of which are transcribed.
This figure is similar to the opossum, which has 11 class I
genes, 9 of which are transcribed [31]. Of the 15 class I
genes with open reading frames, three are putative class Ia
genes (Maeu-UA (chr7), Maeu-UB (chr6) and Maeu-UC
(chr1)), four are putative class Ib genes (Maeu-UM, MaeuUK, Maeu-UE and Maeu-UO), four show no evidence of
expression and the remaining genes appear to be
expressed only at low levels and are not classified as class
Ia or class Ib (Maeu-UD, Maeu-UF, Maeu-UH and MaeuUN). The number of class Ia genes in the tammar wallaby
is similar to eutherian species (usually 2 or 3).
It is likely that the tammar wallaby class Ia genes were
originally located within the MHC on chromosome 2,
interspersed with antigen processing genes. The first repositioning of wallaby class I genes away from chromosome
2 led to the class I gene, Maeu-UN, at the telomeric end of
chromosome 5q, given its basal position on the phylogenetic tree (Figure 2). Molecular dating indicates that this
repositioning occurred over 65 mya and that all the class
Ia and class Ia-like genes trace back to this common ancestor. Maeu-UP, located on chromosome 2, most likely gave
rise to Maeu-UN as it is the class I gene most closely
related to the MHC un-linked class I genes. We previously
proposed that the Kangaroo Endogenous RetroViral elements (KERV), found at the centromeres of all tammar
wallaby chromosomes and near the telomere of chromosome 5, may have played a role in the repositioning of
class I genes by creating instability in the MHC region
(which is located near a KERV-rich area at the centromere
of chromosome 2) [32,41]. The results of this study confirm the presence of partial KERV sequences located adjacent to a number of the MHC un-linked class I genes
(Figure 1) and provides support for the hypothesis that
KERVs may have contributed to the duplication and
movement of class I genes in the wallaby. All MHC unlinked class I genes described here are located at subtelomeric or pericentric regions, which are known hotspots
not only for segmental duplication [42], but also the
insertion and retention of repeat sequences, illegitimate
recombination and frequent rearrangements [43]. In the
wallaby there is evidence of subtelomeric and pericentric

rearrangement of genes. Three genes, ARHGAP20,
GPR128 and HNRPM, located adjacent to MHC un-linked
class I genes in the wallaby are in unexpected positions
when compared to their homologues in the opossum
genome and based on karyotype evolution of marsupials
or gene mapping data (Table 2) [44,45]. These movements suggest these regions have been subject to rearrangement in the wallaby.
Retrotransposons can act as recombination hotspots in
the genome via homologous recombination between retrotransposon sequences MHC un-linked on different
chromosomes [46]. Phylogenetic analysis shows that wallaby class I genes on different chromosomes may be more
closely related to one another than to an adjacent class I
(eg Maeu-UB-6q and Maeu-UF-4p). A similar pattern
emerges when the KERV fragments on different chromosomes are compared and may indicate that the class I
genes and KERVs are causing recombination hotspots
within the genome, fueling class I gene diversification and
polymorphism, and providing an advantage for the wallaby MHC. The presence of numerous partial KERVs suggests these elements have not been recently active and that
the original movement of a class I gene to chromosome 5
(perhaps by amplification of KERV and transposition)
occurred early in the evolution of the Australian marsupial lineage, which is supported by the predicted date of
movement, approximately 65 mya.
The repositioning of class Ia genes out of the MHC in wallaby ancestors over 65 million years ago indicates that
class I genes are located outside the MHC in many other
Australian species, including other macropods and the
brushtail possum, as these species diverged less than 30
million years ago [34]. Previously we suggested that ModoUB and Modo-UC were evolving towards class Ib genes
due to their location outside the MHC [31]. Given that
wallabies have non MHC-linked class Ia genes, it is feasible that Modo-UB and UC are also classical given their
close relationship to Modo-UA. The presence of class Ia
genes, responsible for antigen presentation, outside the
MHC of marsupials for an extended period of evolution-

ary time suggests an advantage is gained in having class Ia
genes organized in this way.
It has been suggested that the repositioning of class Ia
genes away from the antigen processing genes in mammals allowed the class Ia genes to duplicate [21]. We propose that marsupials gained a similar advantage from
moving class Ia genes outside the MHC. Some non-mammals have only one class Ia gene, which in species such as
Xenopus [21], chicken [20] and nurse shark [22] is linked
to the antigen processing genes within the MHC. This
ancestral MHC organization has the advantage that TAP
and class Ia alleles co-evolve [5]. For instance, the chicken
TAP genes are polymorphic, with specific TAP alleles
transporting peptides for specific class Ia alleles, providing
an efficient response to certain pathogens [20]. Duplication and subsequent diversification of such class Ia genes
would therefore disrupt the advantageous linkage and
resulting co-evolution between class Ia and TAP alleles
[21,24]. Co-evolution of class I and TAP is not confined to
non-mammals, but has been observed within the rat
MHC as well [47]. However, in the majority of eutherian
mammals the class Ia genes have moved away from the
TAP genes to become interspersed with the framework
genes of the MHC. The TAP genes are no longer polymorphic, but have become promiscuous and can present a
broader array of pathogenic peptides [24]. Marsupials and
eutherian species, independently, found it advantageous
to separate class Ia genes from antigen processing genes,
resulting in differing class I organization between these
lineages of mammals, but effectively the same outcome,
multiple class Ia genes. However, it should be noted that
some non-mammalian species have multiple class Ia
genes adjacent to TAP genes and may have diversified
class I genes, while maintaining linkage with antigen
processing genes [7].
The extensive duplication and dispersal of class I genes in
the wallaby may have been assisted by their complete
removal from the MHC and the constraints this region
imposes. In eutherian mammals the class I genes are interspersed with the framework genes, which are highly conserved. The duplication and repositioning of class I genes
in this region is believed to be restricted by these framework genes, as class I movement that disrupts these genes
would be deleterious [48]. In the wallaby the class I genes
have moved away from the MHC altogether and their
duplication and repositioning is not restricted. Of the
nine MHC un-linked class I genes, not all are expressed at
the same level and three appear highly expressed and have
evidence of polymorphism. Thus, there is still a restraint
on the maximum number of class Ia genes due to the need
to maintain a wide spectrum of T cells after thymic selection.

The MHC-linked class I genes in the tammar wallaby are
non-classical class I genes, based on promoter elements,
expression patterns and levels of polymorphism. The
changes in promoter sequence of the class Ib genes in the
tammar wallaby perhaps explains the variation in expression patterns for these genes. Maeu-UM, UE, and UO have
tissue-specific expression and are not polymorphic, with
few substitutions in the PBR of different alleles. Maeu-UK
has low levels of polymorphism and is expressed in all tissues. Maeu-UM and Maeu-UK are clear orthologs of the
opossum class Ib genes, Modo-UM and Modo-UK, despite
these species being separated by 80 million years of evolution and belonging to different Orders. An expressed
transcript has been isolated from the brushtail possum
(Trvu19) that is closely related to Maeu-UK and Modo-UK
[49]. This transcript may represent a processed pseudogene as it has a frameshift mutation at the 5' end of the α1
domain [49]. However, expressed transcripts from the
tammar wallaby show no evidence of this mutation and
also include the leader peptide. Further, the frameshift
mutation described in the possum sequence is very close
to the forward primer site used to amplify this sequence.
It is possible that the described mutation is a sequencing
artifact, as conservation of a processed pseudogene in the
possum is unlikely. As there is evidence that an ortholog
of UK exists in the brushtail possum we predict all Australian marsupials would share the UK class I gene. Orthology
between class I genes of distantly related species is highly
unusual for class I genes, which typically form species specific clades due to their rapid evolution [50]. It has been
proposed that MHC polymorphism can be passed to species as they evolve from a common ancestor [51], however, no examples of class I orthology have been
demonstrated between species belonging to different phylogenetic orders [18,50]. The class I genes of human and
mouse, separated by a similar evolutionary distance as the
tammar wallaby and opossum, do not show clear orthology, despite some genes, such as HLA-E and H2-Qa1, sharing similar functions. It is believed their orthologous
relationship is obscured by gene conversion [30]. The
conservation of orthologs, Modo-UM/Maeu-UM and
Modo-UK/Maeu-UK, over such an extended period of time
leads us to speculate that these genes may have a critical,
marsupial-specific function. The marsupial mode of
reproduction and development poses immunological
challenges to the pouch young, which are born after a
short gestation and are immuno-naïve at birth. We propose that conserved marsupial class Ib molecules may
play a role in the immunological protection of marsupial
young. Maeu-UM is expressed in the lung as well as the
spleen and thymus, and it is possible this molecule plays
a role in the protection of exposed surfaces. Ongoing studies in our laboratories will look into the function of these
molecules in a range of marsupials.

Conclusion
The tammar wallaby has a novel MHC class I organization, which has successfully maintained functional,
diverse class I genes. The class I genes do not follow conventional models of class I evolution as class Ib genes
have remained linked to the MHC whereas the class Ia
genes are not linked to the MHC but have maintained polymorphism and high expression levels. This unique
organization provides a model for studying the importance of MHC gene clustering on gene function. Furthermore, our analysis has shown that some marsupial class
Ib genes are remarkably conserved within this highly
adapted mammalian lineage. The important biological
differences between marsupial and eutherian mammals in
their mode of reproduction and the pathogenic pressures
on their immune system can be used to provide insights
into how class Ib function is adapted to the biology of a
species.

Methods
BAC selection and sequencing
We have previously described the isolation and physical
mapping of nine of the class I BACs described here from a
10× tammar wallaby BAC library (Arizona Genomics
Institute) to chromosomes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 [32]. An
additional four class I BACs have now been isolated and
physically mapped to chromosome 2q according to
Deakin et al. (2007) [32]. All BACs were confirmed to
contain class I genes by southern blot analysis using a previously described conserved class I exon 4 fragment as a
probe [52]. This analysis was also used to determine
which BACs were overlapping based on shared bands and
redundant BACs were excluded from the sequencing process. In total, 14 BACs were selected, sequenced and annotated as previously described [36] and submitted under
the following accession numbers to the Genbank database: MEKBa_248E8 [CU457750]; MEKBa_211G21

Chicken: Gaga B-FIV, AF013491; Human: Hosa MICA,
L14848. The nucleotide and amino acid identity between
the sequences was calculated using Bioedit [54]. A neighbour joining tree was constructed with the nucleotide
sequence of the α1, α2 and α3 domains (across 654
nucleotides) using Jukes-Cantor distance [40,55] with
1000 bootstraps in the Mega 4.0 software [56]. The phylogenetic analysis was repeated with the α3 domain only
and the α1 and α2 domains only to test for differences in
relationships between different regions of the genes, but
the topology of the tree was not altered.
Molecular dating of genes was accomplished using BEAST
[57]. Calibration nodes were defined using divergence
dates for tammar wallaby and opossum; brushtail possum
and tammar wallaby; and block duplication dates of
human HLA-C and HLA-B. The Yule process was used as
tree prior. Three identical analyses were run to check for
consistency between runs. Chain length was set to
10,000,000 and logged every 1,000 steps. Tracer [57] was
used to analysis BEAST output. Trees were summarized
using a burning value of 1,000. A maximum clade credibility summary tree was produced where node heights
equaled mean heights. FigTree was used to produce the
final tree.
Promoter sequences were identified by performing a dot
plot analysis [58] on the upstream nucleotide sequence
(2000 bp) of Modo-UA and the wallaby class I genes to
identify conserved regions of the sequence. Specific elements were then identified manually by aligning the wallaby class I genes to Modo-UA, mammalian (pig) and nonmammalian (duck) class I promoters using ClustalW.
Nucleotide identity between promoter sequences were
calculated as described above.
KERV sequences were identified using BLAST (Basic Local
Alignment Search Tool) with a previously identified full
length KERV (KERV-1, Genbank-AF044909) sequence as
the query. KERV sequences were extracted and aligned
with KERV-1 using ClustalW.
Primer design
Gene specific forward and reverse primers were designed
to amplify the α1 and α2 domains of the MHC-linked
class I genes, Maeu-UE (Primer set 1), Maeu- UK (Primer

set 2) Maeu-UO (Primer set 3) and Maeu-UM (Primer set
4) (Table 3). The forward primers were designed as close
to the beginning of the α1 domain as possible and the
reverse primers were designed as close to the end of the α2
domain as possible. Variation in the primer sites was necessary to maintain specificity for each gene. The nine
MHC un-linked class I genes show a high level of nucleotide identity, thus the design of locus specific primers for
these genes was impossible. Instead, previously described
tammar wallaby class I cDNA sequences isolated from the
spleen [52] were used to design multi-locus primers that
amplify the α1, α2 and α3 domains of the MHC unlinked class I genes (primer set 5).
Expression studies on MHC un-linked class I genes
RNA was extracted from the blood of four individuals (I–
IV) (Tri-reagent BD, Sigma-Aldrich) and reverse transcribed (Superscript III, Invitrogen). RNA was extracted
from the thoracic thymus of a fifth individual (V) and 5'
RACE cDNA was made (GeneRacer, Invitrogen). To determine which of the nine MHC un-linked class I genes are
expressed two approaches were used. First, primer set 5
was used to amplify the α1, α2 and α3 domains of
expressed class I genes from the blood of individuals I–IV
using high fidelity taq polymerase (Platinum DNA taq
polymerase high fidelity, Invitrogen) and the following
PCR conditions: Initial denaturation at 94.0°C for 3 min,
followed by 29 cycles of 94.0°C for 30 s, 60°C for 30 s,
and 72°C for 2 min, and a final extension at 72°C for 10
min. Twenty-five clones were sequenced from individuals
I–IV, a total of 125 clones.

Second, to ensure all potential transcripts were isolated,
the α3 reverse primer from primer set 6 and 5' GeneRacer
primer (Invitrogen) were used to amplify expressed class I
from the thymus sample of individual V with the following PCR conditions: Initial denaturation at 94.0°C for 3
min, followed by 29 cycles of 94.0°C for 30 s, 68°C for 30
s, and 72°C for 2 min, and a final extension at 72°C for
10 min. The resulting PCR products were cloned into the
pGEM-T easy vector system (Promega) and 25 clones were
sequenced in both directions. All sequences were quality
checked in Sequencher 4.1.4 (GeneCodes) and all unique
class I transcripts were compared to the genomic class I
genes by constructing a neighbor joining tree with 1000
bootstraps in Mega 4.0. The resulting phylogenetic tree
was used to determine class I transcripts highly similar to
genomic class I genes and these class I transcripts have
been submitted to Genbank with the accession numbers
FJ238079 to FJ238088.
Expression studies on MHC-linked class I genes
Gene specific primer sets (1–4), described above, were
used to amplify Maeu-UE, Maeu-UO, Maeu-UP, Maeu-UM,
and Maeu-UK from the thymus RACE cDNA of individual
V, to determine if these genes are expressed. The PCR conditions for each gene showing evidence of expression were
as follows: Maeu-UM – Initial denaturation at 94.0°C for
3 min, followed by 29 cycles of 94.0°C for 30 s, 63°C for
30 s, and 72°C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72°C
for 10 min; Maeu-UK, Maeu-UE, Maeu-UO – Initial denaturation at 94.0°C for 3 min, followed by 29 cycles of
94.0°C for 30 s, 60°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 1 min, and a

final extension at 72°C for 10 min. The amplified products varied between 0.25 kb and 0.4 kb, depending on the
primer set. The amplified products were cloned into the
pGEM-T easy vector system (Promega) and six clones were
sequenced in both the forward and reverse directions for
each gene. No more than two alleles were amplified for
each primer set. The sequences were quality checked in
Sequencher 4.1.4 (GeneCodes) and aligned with the class
I genes annotated on the BACs. All transcripts have been
submitted to Genbank with the accession numbers
FJ238064, FJ238067, FJ238071 and FJ238075.
Expression of Maeu-UE, Maeu-UO, Maeu-UM, and MaeuUK was detected in the thymus. No evidence of expression
was detected for Maeu-UL or Maeu-UP despite a range of
PCR conditions trialed, so PCR conditions for these
primer sets are not described here and further expression
studies were not performed. The expression pattern of
Maeu-UE, Maeu-UO, Maeu-UM, and Maeu-UK was then
assessed in the spleen, testis, liver, lung, kidney and gut.
RNA was extracted from the tissues of a single individual
(Tri-reagent, Sigma-Aldrich) and reverse transcribed
(Superscript III, Invitrogen). The RNA was not treated
with DNase to enable the intron between exon 2 and exon
3 to be amplified and compared between different genes.
Primer sets 1, 3, 4 and 5 were used to test for expression of
each gene.
Polymorphism studies on MHC linked class I genes
Primer sets 1–4 were used to amplify Maeu-UE, Maeu-UO,
Maeu-UM and Maeu-UK from DNA of individuals I–V
using the PCR conditions described above. Maeu-UL and
Maeu-UP were excluded as expression was not detected for
these genes (see below). The resulting fragment included
exon 2, exon 3 and the intervening intron. The amplified
fragments were cloned into a pGEM-T easy vector
(Promega) and six clones from each individual were
sequenced in both directions. The sequences were quality
checked in Sequencher 4.1.4 (GeneCodes) before being
imported into bioedit and compared for polymorphism.
No more than two alleles were amplified for each gene.
The unique alleles for each gene have been submitted to
Genbank with the following accession numbers
FJ238065, FJ238066, FJ238068, FJ238069, FJ238070,
FJ23807, FJ238073, FJ238074, FJ238076 and FJ238077.
