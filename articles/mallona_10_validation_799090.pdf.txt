Validation of reference genes for quantitative
real-time PCR during leaf and flower
development in Petunia hybrida

Abstract
Background: Identification of genes with invariant levels of gene expression is a prerequisite for validating
transcriptomic changes accompanying development. Ideally expression of these genes should be independent of
the morphogenetic process or environmental condition tested as well as the methods used for RNA purification
and analysis.
Results: In an effort to identify endogenous genes meeting these criteria nine reference genes (RG) were tested in
two Petunia lines (Mitchell and V30). Growth conditions differed in Mitchell and V30, and different methods were
used for RNA isolation and analysis. Four different software tools were employed to analyze the data. We merged
the four outputs by means of a non-weighted unsupervised rank aggregation method. The genes identified as
optimal for transcriptomic analysis of Mitchell and V30 were EF1a in Mitchell and CYP in V30, whereas the least
suitable gene was GAPDH in both lines.
Conclusions: The least adequate gene turned out to be GAPDH indicating that it should be rejected as reference
gene in Petunia. The absence of correspondence of the best-suited genes suggests that assessing reference gene
stability is needed when performing normalization of data from transcriptomic analysis of flower and leaf
development.

Background
The general aims of transcriptomic analysis are identification of genes differentially expressed and measurement
of the relative levels of their transcripts. Transcriptomic
analysis like that relying on microarray techniques reveals
an underlying expression dynamic that changes between
tissues and over time [1]. Results must then be validated
by other means in order to obtain robust data that will
support working hypotheses directed at a better understanding of development or environmental responsiveness. Since the advent of quantitative PCR, it has become
the method of choice to validate gene expression data.
However, data obtained by qPCR can be strongly affected
by the properties of the starting material, RNA extraction
procedures, and cDNA synthesis. Therefore, relative
quantification procedures require comparison of the
gene of interest to an internal control, based on a

normalization factor derived from one or more genes
that can be argued to be equally active in the relevant cell
types. This requires the previous identification of such
genes, which can then be reliably used to normalise relative expression of genes of interest.
Identification of candidate genes useful for normalization has become a major task, as it has been shown that
normalization errors are probably the most common
mistake, resulting in significant artefacts that can lead to
erroneous conclusions [2]. Several software tools have
been developed to compute relative levels of specific
transcripts (commonly referred to as ‘gene expression’,
although obviously transcript stability is also an important factor contributing to transcript levels) based on
group-wise comparisons between a gene of interest and
another endogenous gene [3]. However identification of
genes with stable patterns of gene expression requires
pairwise testing of several genes with each other.
Among the software programs developed toward this
end are geNorm [4], BestKeeper [5], NormFinder [6] or

qBasePlus [7]. The programs geNorm and qBasePlus use
pairwise comparisons and geometric averaging across a
matrix of reference genes. qBasePlus also calculates a
coefficient of variation (CV) for each gene as a stability
measurement. BestKeeper uses pairwise correlation analysis of each internal gene to an optimal normalization
factor that merges data from all of them. Finally, NormFinder fits data to a mathematical model, which allows
comparison of intra- and intergroup variation and calculation of expression stability.
Using the programs described above researchers have
identified genes suitable for use as normalization controls in Arabidopsis [8], rice [9], potato leaves [10], the
parasitic plant Orobanche ramosa [11], Brachypodium
distachyon [12] and grape [13]. In the Solanaceae, candidate genes for normalization have been determined
based on EST abundance [14], and qPCR followed by
statistical analysis using the tools described above have
been reported [15].
A feature shared amongst these studies, and a large
number of additional publications describing human,
animal and plant systems, is the identification of genes
specific for a certain tissue, developmental stage or
environmental condition. This is a logical experimental
design, as individual research programs tend to be
focused, and the number of appropriate genes can be
expected to be inversely related to the number of cell
types or conditions under investigation. Recent studies
that included different cultivars of soybean [16], underscore how the characteristics of the plant and the types
of organs studied must drive the experimental approach
to transcriptomic analysis.
The garden Petunia (Petunia hybrida) has been extensively used as a model for developmental biology
[17,18]. Amongst the inbred Petunia lines used in
research, the white-flowered Mitchell [19], also known
as W115, is routinely exploited for transformation and
scent studies [20-22]. The genetics of flower pigmentation has been intensively studied in lines such as V30
[23]. Mitchell and V30 are genetically dissimilar, as
demonstrated in mapping studies, and vary in a number
of other ways, including growth habit and amenability
to propagation in culture. Here we have used multiple
developmental stages of flowers and leaves of these two
Petunia lines to identify genes that show reliable robustness as candidates for use in normalization of relative
transcript abundance. The experiments were carried out
in two different laboratories, with different PCR
machines and different purification and amplification
conditions. We found that the final shortlist of valuable
genes was different between lines suggesting the necessity of performing reference gene stability measurements
as part of the experimental design where differences in
gene expression in Petunia is tested.

Petunia lines, developmental stages and selection
of genes for normalization

Two very different Petunia lines were used for the analyses. Mitchell, also known as W115, is a doubled haploid line obtained from anther culture of an interspecific
Petunia hybrid [19]; it is characterized by vigorous
growth, exceptional fertility, strong fragrance and white
flowers. V30 is an inbred line of modest growth habit
and fertility featuring deep purple petals and pollen.
From each line we harvested flowers representing four
developmental stages, from young flower buds to open
flowers shortly before anthesis, and two leaf developmental stages, young and full-sized (Figure 1).
Potentially useful RG were selected based on review of
the relevant literature, from which we identified genes
previously used for normalization or routinely used as
controls for northern blots or RT-PCR. From the original list we developed a short list of nine, including
genes encoding Actin-11 (ACT), Cyclophilin-2 (CYP)
[10], Elongation factor 1a (EF1a), Ubiquitin (UBQ) Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), GTPbinding protein RAN1 (RAN1), SAND protein (SAND)
[8,24,25], Ribosomal protein S13 (RPS13) [6] and
b-Tubulin 6 (TUB) [26] (Table 1). The products of
these genes are associated with a wide variety of biological functions. Moreover, these genes are described as
not co-regulated, a prerequisite for using one of the
algorithms to identify stably expressed genes (geNorm)
reliably [4].
Strategy for data mining and statistical analysis

The genes described above were selected to test for stability of transcript levels through leaf and flower development in two Petunia lines, Mitchell and V30. As the
aim of the present work is to find if we could obtain a
similar rank of genes irrespective of the Petunia line,
growth conditions or sample processing, we developed
all the data mining procedures separately for each line.
Cycle threshold (CT) values were determined and
expression stability, i.e., the constancy of transcript
levels, ranked. As a strategy for calculating relative
expression quantities (RQ) we applied the qBasePlus
software, taking into account for each reaction its specific PCR efficiency. Rescaling of normalized quantities
employed the sample with the lowest CT value (see
materials and methods and Figure 2). With qBasePlus
we measured expression stability (M values) and coefficients of variation (CV values). Relative quantities were
transferred to geNorm for computing M stability values.
It is worth noting that the procedure for computing M
values differs between geNorm and qBasePlus. Finally,
we used the combined stability measurements produced
by geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and qBasePlus to

establish a consensus rank of genes by applying RankAggreg [27]. The input to this statistical package was a
matrix of rank-ordered genes according to the different
stability measurements previously computed. RankAggreg calculated Spearman footrule distances and the
software reformatted this distance matrix into an
ordered list that matched each inital order as closely as
possible This consensus rank list was obtained by means
of the Cross-Entropy Monte Carlo algorithm present in
the software.
CT values and variability between organs and
developmental stages in Mitchell and V30

Real-time PCR reactions were performed on the six
cDNA samples obtained from each Petunia line with the
nine primer pairs representing the candidate RG. In
order to assess run reliability non-template controls
were added and three technical repetitions were
included for each biological replicate. CT values were

defined as the number of cycles required for normalized
fluorescence to reach a manually set threshold of 20%
total fluorescence. Product melting analysis and/or gel
electrophoresis allowed for the discarding of non-specific products. Moreover, we considered only CT technical
repetitions differing by less than one cycle.
The CT values obtained for all the genes under study
differed between the two Petunia lines (Figure 3). The
range of values was consistently narrower in Mitchell
than in V30. This could indicate that gene expression in
general is less variable in Mitchell than in V30, however
these data correspond to averages derived from all the
samples and further analysis showed that in fact V30
exhibited more constant levels of tested transcripts at
the single organ level or developmental stage (see
below).
For Mitchell samples UBQ was the most highly
expressed gene overall, with a CT of 14.8, and SAND

were calculated using different thresholds depending on the
variety. Efficiency value taken for line Mitchell was 2; for line V30,
there was one value for each tube. Circles indicate statistical results
to be merged with RankAggreg (Pihur 2009). Relative quantities
(RQ) were scaled to the sample with lowest CT value (flower stage
C). CT data were checked for normality (Shapiro-Wilk test) and, due
to non-normality, they were analysed by non-parametrical tests
(Kruskal and Wallis). Since CT values showed non-equal distributions
according to the organ from which RNA was extracted, they were
further tested using pairwise Wilcoxon tests with Bonferroni’s
correction with the aim of solving pairwise significant variations. A
significance threshold of 0.05 was used. Abbreviations: PV, pairwise

the lowest, with a CT of 21.2. In contrast, the highest
and lowest expressed genes in V30 were EF1a and ACT,
with CTs of 18.3 and 25.1, respectively.
Analysis of variance of CT values between organs was
performed separately for Mitchell and V30 samples.
Since CT values were not normally distributed, we calculated Kruskall-Wallis and a post-hoc Pairwise Rank Sum

Wilcoxon test, both non-parametrical, using a Bonferroni
correction and a significance cut-off of 0.05. In Mitchell
the genes RAN1, RPS13 and UBQ showed significant differences in transcript levels between developmental
stages (Additional file 1). RAN1 transcript levels differed
significantly between leaf A and flowers C and D, RPS13
differed in flower D from the rest of floral stages analysed, and UBQ transcript levels differed significantly
between leaf A and flower D. For V30, the overall CT
variability was higher than that seen in Mitchell; in fact,
expression of all the genes analysed showed significant
differences between one or more sets of organs and/or
developmental stages. Expression of the genes GAPDH
and TUB differed between leaves A and C, while levels of
other measured transcripts were essentially the same in
the two leaf stages. In contrast, during flower development, we could distinguish genes that showed two levels
of significantly different CT values (GAPDH and TUB),
those that showed three (ACT, CYP, EF1a and RPS13)
and others that differed at each developmental stage analysed (RAN1, SAND and UBQ).
Stability of gene expression in Mitchell and V30

Data from each of the two chosen Petunia lines were
analyzed separately. As a first approach, we applied data
as a unique population and transferred it to NormFinder, BestKeeper, geNorm and qBasePlus according to
the flowchart plotted in Figure 2. In a second approach,
we subdivided data into several subpopulations, corresponding to unique developmental stages (i.e., flower C
or leaf A), then, piped this data into the qBasePlus and
geNorm tools. The results of both sets of analyses are
presented in Tables 2 and 3 and Additional files 2, 3
and 4.
CT values were log-transformed and used as input for
the NormFinder tool, which fitted this data into a

Gene expression data were analyzed using five statistical parameters in both Petunia lines. Each column refers to a gene suitability ranking computed by one
statistical tool, taking into account all data of a Petunia line.

mathematical model based on six independent groups
corresponding to single developmental stages. Estimates
for stability of gene expression are based on the comparison between inter- and intra-group variability. In the
Mitchell line, the gene exhibiting the most stable level of
expression was EF1a (stability value of 0.018) and CYP
and EF1a represented the best combination (0.017). In
V30, NormFinder estimated UBQ (0.053) as the most
stably expressed gene, and RAN1 and UBQ (0.069) as
the best combination of two genes.
CT values and one efficiency value for each primer
pair served as input for the BestKeeper package. This
program was intended to establish the best-suited standards out of the nine RG candidates, and to merge
them in a normalization factor called the BestKeeper

index. Because BestKeeper software is designed to determine a reliable normalization factor but not to compute
the goodness of each RG independently, we took as the
stability-of-expression value the coefficient of determination of each gene to the BestKeeper index. BestKeeper
calculated the highest reliability for CYP in line Mitchell
and V30 finding GAPDH as the least suitable gene in
Mitchell and TUB in V30.
qBasePlus and geNorm calculate M stability values by
a slightly different procedure. This parameter is defined
as the average pair-wise variation in the level of transcripts from one gene with that of all other reference
genes in a given group of samples; it is inversely related
to expression stability. However, because the inclusion
of a gene with highly variable expression can alter the

Mallona et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:4
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/4

estimation of the rest, geNorm (but not qBasePlus) performs a stepwise exclusion of the least stably expressed
genes. Taking into account the entire dataset from
Mitchell with geNorm, RAN1 and SAND were calculated
to be the most stably expressed genes (M value 0.5),
GAPDH the least (1.15). In V30, RPS13 and UBQ were
calculated to be the genes of least variable expression
(0.64), whereas GAPDH was the most variable (2.61). In
terms of qBasePlus M values, EF1a was valued as the
best gene for Mitchell (0.85) and GAPDH the worst
(1.76); for V30, ACT was ranked as the most valuable
gene (2.11) and GAPDH was the worst (3.66).
Considering each developmental stage separately, we
found that M values were consistently higher in Mitchell
than in V30, suggesting more variable levels of RG
expression in Mitchell. Flower stage D exhibited the
most stable expression pattern in both lines (Figure 4).
It is noteworthy that stability of transcript levels
between reproductive and vegetative modules differed in
the two lines. In general, M values calculated with qBasePlus, were higher in flowers stage C and D than in
leaves from Mitchell, whereas V30 showed an opposite
trend. A remarkable case was GAPDH, with an M value
four times higher in Mitchell than in V30 at leaf stage
C, whereas it was three times lower in Mitchell compared to V30 at flower stage A (see Table 2).
Mean CV value, a measurement of the variation of relative quantities of RNA for a normalized reference gene,
showed little difference between lines, with a value of 0.42
in Mitchell and 0.44 in V30, for data analysed as a whole.
Determination of the number of genes for normalization

Quantification of gene expression relative to multiple
reference genes implies the calculation of a normalization factor (NF) that merges data from several internal
genes. Determination of the minimal number of its

Page 6 of 11

components is estimated by computing the pairwise variation (PV) of two sequential NFs (Vn/n+1) as the standard deviation of the logarithmically transformed NFn/
NFn+1 ratios, reflecting the effect of including an additional gene [4]. If the pairwise variation value for n
genes is below a cut-off of 0.15, additional genes are
considered not to improve normalization. The number
of genes required for normalization was determined to
be two for both Mitchell and V30, except when either
different floral developmental stages or vegetative and
reproductive stages were mixed (see Table 2).
The PV values showed the same trend as that seen for
stability measurements, i.e., the developmental stage
with the lowest average PV was flower stage D, both in
Mitchell and V30. In contrast, gene expression in leaves
of Mitchell showed more variability, with higher PV
values, than those of V30 (Figure 5).
Consensus list of similarities between lines

The different software programs used to determine gene
suitability for normalization of gene expression give
slightly different results and statistical stability values for
each gene. We arranged the internal genes in five lists
according to the rank positions generated by each of the
five statistical approaches, M values by geNorm and qBasePlus, NormFinder stability value, coefficient of determination to BestKeeper and CV of qBasePlus. These lists
were used to create an aggregate order, with the aim of
obtaining an optimal list of genes for each Petunia line.
The results of the merged data revealed that the most adequate of the genes tested for normalization in Mitchell are
EF1a, SAND and RPS13; the three showing the lowest
reliability are TUB, ACT and GAPDH (Figure 6A and 6B).
For V30, the best candidate genes are CYP, RAN1 and
ACT, while the three lowest ranking are EF1a, SAND and
GAPDH. Thus none of the genes found as highly reliable

using different reagents and PCR machines. The experimental design aimed to maximize potential variability in
transcript abundance for the putative RG under study.
Highly contrasting results would suggest that every
laboratory do a pilot experiment to identify genes suitable for use in normalization; similar results between the
two systems would point to a set of genes reliable for
broad application, minimally for the lines and developmental stages described.
Our findings in terms of line-associated variability
were not in accordance with the results from a soybean
study comparing different cultivars. Results of that study
suggested no highly relevant cultivar influence on RG
suitability [16]. A similar study has been reported in coffee, for which average M stability values for leaves from
different cultivars were lower than that for different
organs of a single cultivar. Our result suggests that
there are differences in gene expression between same
tissues from different lines as well as different tissues
from the same line.

coincide between the lines. Despite of that, GAPDH was
highly unstable in both lines.

Discussion
Identification of robust normalization genes for Petunia

We have attempted to identify a set of genes suitable for
normalization of transcript levels in P. hybrida. Since
several Petunia lines are used for research, we based this
work on two that are extensively used for different purposes. In an effort to reflect different growth environments typical of distinct lab setups, plants of each line
were grown in a set of conditions, differing in photoperiod, thermoperiod and growth substrate between lines
(see methods). RNA was isolated using different RNA
extraction kits, and amplifications were carried out

Development of petals, like that of many tissues and
organs in Petunia, is characterized by a spatial and temporal gradient of cell division that is eventually replaced
by cell expansion [28]. However the experiments
described here used whole flower tissues including full
petals along with sepals, stamens and carpels. This
imposes a general requirement that any gene emerging
as robust be differentially regulated to a huge extent
neither in the various tissues analyzed together nor in
these tissues at different stages of maturation. One
interesting aspect of our findings was the identification
of flower stage C as a particularly noisy developmental
stage compared to early or fully developed flowers. The
transition between cell division and expansion in petals,
or other flower tissues during this developmental stage,
might explain the increased noise. An alternative nonexclusive explanation is that the intermediate stages of
flower development are generally less tightly defined
than the open flower stage.
Leaf development similarly consists of cell growth followed with cell expansion [29]. However, an important
difference between floral and leaf development is that
leaves perform their essential function, e.g., photosynthesis, from a very early stage such that developing leaf
tissue is always a mixture of at least three processes:
growth, cell morphogenesis and differentiated cell function. This combination of processes might account for
the increased gene expression noise observed.
Number of genes required for normalization of gene
expression in Petunia

Gathering data from several RG into a normalization
factor is currently an accepted method of accurate relative quantification of gene expression [30]. Moreover,

plot in which genes are ordered based on their rank position according to each stability measurement (grey lines). Mean rank position of each

this method has been statistically and empirically validated [13,31]. Ideally the number of genes required
should be low enough to make experimental procedures
affordable, and high enough to merit confidence in the
conclusions. The PV value obtained for both Mitchell
and V30 was very low. Although the value tended to be
higher in Mitchell, the number of genes deemed necessary for normalization was the same for both lines:
using the proposed cut-off of 0.15 and comparing single
developmental stages, the required number was two for
Mitchell and V30. The requirement for only two genes
is low compared to the results reported for other phylogenetically related species [10,15,32] and will require significantly less work than the previously suggested
minimum of three genes [4].
Data mining strategies and consensus list of genes
for normalization

The present research aims to identify the control genes
best suited for use in gene expression studies in several
organs of two Petunia lines. The candidate RG combined classical and recently identified genes. Since each
software package can introduce bias, we employed several tools in our analysis. As discussed by other authors,
geNorm bases its stability measurement on pairwise
comparisons of relative expression quantities of all the

panel of genes in the material of interest requiring a
suite of non-coregulated RG [6]. BestKeeper and NormFinder examine primarily CT values, whereas qBasePlus
and geNorm evaluate RQ, a consequence of which is
that PCR efficiency dissimilarities can affect stability
measurements [16]. Nevertheless, some of these algorithms are intrinsically biased because they assume that
data are normally distributed. For instance BestKeeper is
based on Pearson correlation analysis, which requires
normally distributed and variance homogeneous data.
The author described this problem and suggested
further versions of the software in which Spearman and
Kendall Tau correlation should be used [5]. However,
those versions are currently not available.
Our plant material diverged in the variability of statistical outputs amongst lines. V30 showed a high variability in terms of raw expression data (CT values) and low
in terms of expression stability measurements, whereas
Mitchell showed the opposite responses. Our global
analysis merged different statistics, some of which are
CT-based and others RQ-based, with the aim of counteracting this biasing influence.
Summarizing the results of our entire dataset analysis,
geNorm recommended use of RAN1 and SAND genes
for Mitchell and RPS13 and UBQ for V30 and

Mallona et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:4
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/4

discouraged use of GAPDH for both lines. Non-suitability of GAPDH has been described by several authors
[33,34]. Regarding to Solanaceae, its unsuitability has
been confirmed in tomato [15] but it was selected as a
stable RG in coffee [35]. Due to its sequential exclusion
of the least stable gene in the M value calculus algorithm, geNorm M values can differ from those of qBasePlus. qBasePlus corresponded with geNorm, evaluating
EF1a as the most reliable gene in line Mitchell but differed in line V30, recommending ACT as the best candidate. EF1a suitability has been confirmed in potato
during biotic and abiotic stress [10], atlantic salmon [36]
and several developmental stages of Xenopus laevis [37].
Expression of ACT genes differs depending on the
family member. ACT2/7 has been reported as a stably
expressed gene whereas ACT11 was reported as unstable
[38,39]. It is worth noting that the ACT gene used in
this study corresponds to an ACT11.

at two different stages, stage A corresponded to young,
small leaves and stage C to fully expanded ones. Three
independent samples of each of the developmental
stages of flowers and leaves were taken.
RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis
Mitchell material

Total RNA was isolated from 100 mg homogenized
plant material using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Putative genomic DNA contamination
was eliminated by treatment with recombinant DNase I
(Qiagen) as recommended by the vendor. RNA concentration and purity was estimated from the ratio of absorbance readings at 260 and 280 nm and the RNA
integrity was tested by gel electrophoresis. cDNA synthesis was performed using M-MLV reverse transcriptase
(Promega, Mannheim, Germany) starting with 1 μg of
total RNA in a volume of 20 μL with oligo(dT)19 primer at 42°C for 50 min.
V30 material

Conclusions
Altogether, there were strong similarities between the
different programs but the coincidence in assigning best
and worst genes was not absolute. The fact that each
program identified slightly different genes as best suited
for normalization prompted us to merge the data in an
unsupervised way and giving identical weight to the output of the different programs. We used the RankAggreg
program for this purpose. Our results show that
GAPDH was the worst gene to use in normalization in
both lines. In contrast, the suggested genes did not coincide and were EF1a and SAND in Mitchell, whilst CYP
and RAN1 were the genes of choice in V30. In conclusion, we provide a list of genes in discrete developmental stages that show M values below 0.5 (Table 2) [4].
A normalization factor including two genes should be
enough for reliable quantification. Nevertheless we propose a reference gene stability test when performing
gene expression studies in Petunia.
Methods
Plant material

Petunia hybrida lines Mitchell and V30 were grown
in growth chambers. Mitchell plants were grown on
ED73 + Optifer (Patzer) under a 10 h light/14 h dark
cycle, with a constant temperature of 22°C (60% humidity).
V30 plants were germinated in vermiculite and grown
in a vermiculite-perlite-turf-coconut fiber mixture
(2:1:2:2). Plants were kept under a long day photoperiod
(16L: 8 D) with 25°C in L and 18°C in D.
Flowers were classified into four developmental stages:
flower buds (stage A, 1-1.5 cm), elongated buds (stage
B, 2,5-3 cm), pre-anthesis (stage C, 3.5 -4.5 cm) and
fully opened flowers shortly before anthesis (stage D)
according to Cnudde et al. [40]. Leaves were harvested

Samples were homogenized in liquid nitrogen with a
mortar and pestle. Total RNA was isolated using the
NucleoSpin® RNA Plant (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. This
RNA isolation kit contains DNaseI in the extraction buffer, added to the column once RNA is bound to the spin
column. RNA was measured by photometry at 260 nm
and quality-controlled on denaturing agarose gels. Total
RNA (0.8 μg) was transcribed using the SuperScript® III
(Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA) and oligodT20 employing 10 μL 2× RT reaction mix, 2 μL RT enzyme mix
and 8 μL RNA. Reverse transcription was performed on
a GeneAmp Perkin-Elmer 9700 thermocycler (Perkin
Elmer, Norwalk, CT, USA) by using the following programme: 10 min at 25°C, 30 min at 50°C and 5 min at
85°C; addition of 1 u of Escherichia coli RNAse H, and
incubation for 2 h at 15°C.
PCR optimisation

We selected nine genes to be tested as reference transcripts (ACT, CYP, EF1a, GAPDH, RAN2, RPS13, SAND
and UBQ) based on previous descriptions (see below)
(Table 1). PCR conditions were optimised using cDNA
from leaves (stage A) in a Robocycler gradient 96 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and GoTaq® Flexi DNA polymerase
(Promega) in a 25 μL reaction containing: 2 μL of
cDNA, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM each dNTP, 0.4 μL of
each primer and 1.25 U enzyme.
Real-time PCR
Mitchell

Real-time PCR was performed in an Mx 3005P QPCR
system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using a SYBR Green
based PCR assay (with ROX as the optional reference
dye; Power SYBR Green PCR Mastermix, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). A master mix containing
enzymes and primers was added individually per well.

Mallona et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:4
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/4

Each reaction mix containing a 15 ng RNA equivalent of
cDNA and 1 pM gene-specific primers (Tab. 3) was
subjected to the following protocol: 95°C for 10 min followed by 50 cycles of 95°C for 30 sec, 60°C for 1 min
and 72°C for 30 sec, and a subsequent standard dissociation protocol. As a control for genomic DNA contamination, 15 ng of total non-transcribed RNA was used
under the same conditions as described above. All assays
were performed in three technical replicates, as well
three biological replicates.
V30

Reactions were carried out with the SYBR Premix Ex
Taq® (TaKaRa Biotechnology, Dalian, Jiangsu, China) in
a Rotor-Gene 2000 thermocycler (Corbett Research,
Sydney, Australia) and analysed with Rotor-Gene analysis software v. 6.0 as described before [41] with the following modifications: Reaction profiles used were 40
cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 55°C or 60°C for 20 s, 72°C for
15 s, and 80°C for 15 s, followed by melting at 50-95°C
employing the following protocol: 2 μL RNA equivalent
of cDNA, 7.5 μL SYBR Premix Ex Taq 2×, 0.36 μL of
each primer at 10 μM and 4.78 μL distilled water.
Annealing temperature was 55°C (TUB, CYP, ACT,
EF1a, GAPDH, and SAND) or 60°C (RPS13, UBQ,
RAN1) according to the previous optimisation. In order
to reduce pipetting variability, we performed reaction
batches containing primer pairs, and templates were
added in the end. We performed three technical replicates for each reaction and non-template controls, as
well three biological replicates.
Bioinformatics and statistical analysis

Data analysis strategy is described in detail in results.
Reaction efficiency calculus was done using the amplification curve fluorescence, analyzing each tube separately
as described by Liu and Saint (2002) [42]. It was calculated as follows: Efficiency = F(n)/F(n-1), in which n is
defined as the 20% value of the fluorescence at the maximum of the second derivative curve. Curve was defined
by one measure in each amplification cycle. We used
only the exponential phase of the amplification reaction.
Software packages included geNorm v3.4, the excel addin of NormFinder v0.953, BestKeeper v1 and qBasePlus
v1.2. Other statistical procedures were performed with
the R program http://www.R-project.org, v2.7.1 with the
packages stats v2.7.1, multcompView v0.1-0 and RankAggreg v0.3-1[27].
