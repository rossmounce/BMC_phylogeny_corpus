Abstract
Background: The superfamily of serine proteinase inhibitors (serpins) is involved in numerous
fundamental biological processes as inflammation, blood coagulation and apoptosis. Our interest is
focused on the SERPINA3 sub-family. The major human plasma protease inhibitor, α1antichymotrypsin, encoded by the SERPINA3 gene, is homologous to genes organized in clusters in
several mammalian species. However, although there is a similar genic organization with a high
degree of sequence conservation, the reactive-centre-loop domains, which are responsible for the
protease specificity, show significant divergences.
Results: We provide additional information by analyzing the situation of SERPINA3 in the bovine
genome. A cluster of eight genes and one pseudogene sharing a high degree of identity and the same
structural organization was characterized. Bovine SERPINA3 genes were localized by radiation
hybrid mapping on 21q24 and only spanned over 235 Kilobases. For all these genes, we propose a
new nomenclature from SERPINA3-1 to SERPINA3-8. They share approximately 70% of identity with
the human SERPINA3 homologue. In the cluster, we described an original sub-group of six members
with an unexpected high degree of conservation for the reactive-centre-loop domain, suggesting a
similar peptidase inhibitory pattern. Preliminary expression analyses of these bovSERPINA3s
showed different tissue-specific patterns and diverse states of glycosylation and phosphorylation.
Finally, in the context of phylogenetic analyses, we improved our knowledge on mammalian
SERPINAs evolution.
Conclusion: Our experimental results update data of the bovine genome sequencing, substantially
increase the bovSERPINA3 sub-family and enrich the phylogenetic tree of serpins. We provide new
opportunities for future investigations to approach the biological functions of this unusual subset
of serine proteinase inhibitors.

Background
Serine peptidase inhibitors represent a constantly expanding group of structurally related proteins. Amongst them,
the most important family is undoubtedly the serpins, an
acronym for serine proteinase inhibitors [1] which
describes the functional properties of the superfamily. The
name serpin was originally coined in recognition of the
fact that most serpins are inhibitors of serine proteinases.
However, it is now clearly inappropriate because few
members of this superfamily lacked any proteinase inhibitory properties [2,3]. Approximately 500 serpins have
been identified to date and can be found in all superkingdoms including animals, plants, bacteria as well as some
viruses [4,5]. Both extracellular and intracellular serpins
have been identified [6]. Most of them are glycoproteins
(MW 40,000–60,000) composed of a single polypeptide
chain and variable number of oligosaccharide moieties
[7]. The protein structure of serpins is characterized by 3
β-sheets and 8 or 9 α-helices [8]. Serpins present a conserved domain, the reactive-centre-loop domain (RCL)
which connects β-sheets A and C and often acts as "bait"
for the target serine protease [9]. Phylogenetic relationships between orthologous and paralogous serpins have
been studied. Irving et al. [4] compared several hundred
serpin proteins and proposed an arbitrary classification
into eight major and eight minor sub-families from A
(antitrypsin-like) to P (plants), based on clade recognitions and supports. In vertebrates, serpins are involved in
many extracellular processes dependent on serine proteinases such as blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, cell migration, complement activation and inflammation [10,9].
Serpin dysfunction can have pathological consequences
and contributes to diseases such as thrombosis, cancer
[11] and serpinopathies including cirrhosis and emphysema [12]. Serpins are subdivided into the nine first
groups A to I. The two largest groups so far, in all of the
serpins, are the antitrypsin-like and the ovalbumin-like
serpins which are designated "SERPINA" and "SERPINB"
respectively and composed of 13 functional members
each. In the "SERPINA" clade, some of them are involved
in a diversity of biological functions. For example, human
SERPINA3 (α1-antichymotrypsin) is found and identified
as a major component of the fibrillary amyloid plaques of
brains from patients with Alzheimer's disease, one of the
most common forms of dementia [13,14].
According to the structure of their respective genes
(number of introns and exons and relative position at
genomic level), the vertebrate serpin superfamily was subdivided into at least six groups [15]. Most known serpin
genes, including the α1-antichymotrypsin which belongs
to group 2, contain a non-coding first exon and a partly
non-coding last exon.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/151

Clustering of serpin genes occurs in the genome of human
and other species. They present similarities in gene structure: the SERPINA genes characteristically consist of four
exons with identical positioning and phasing of the
intron-exon boundaries. SERPINA1 (α1-antitrypsin),
SERPINA3 (α1-antichymotrypsin), SERPINA5 (PCI, protein C inhibitor), SERPINA9 (centerin), SERPINA10 (ZPI,
protein Z-dependent protease inhibitor) as well as
SERPINA11 are mapped together in the same cluster on
human chromosome 14q32 [16]. More recently, the gene
encoding the SERPINA4 (kallistatin precursor) was also
mapped within this cluster. This close proximity in the
same cluster suggests that these genes might have arisen
by tandem duplications from a common gene ancestor
[16,17]. However, in spite of their close physical proximity, the corresponding proteins have disparate functions,
raising interesting questions about the evolution of gene
function and expression. For example, the SERPINA9 is
likely to function in vivo in the germinal centre B-cells
[18]; the SERPINA5, in addition to its activities within the
blood clotting and fibrinolytic cascades, seems to participate in several biological processes including reproduction and tumor growth [19] and SERPINA10 produces a
rapid inhibition of the coagulation factor Xa in the presence of protein Z (PZ), procoagulant phospholipids and
Ca2+ [20]. An approximate protein similarity of 40–45%
between the human SERPINAs [21] could explain these
diverse physiological functions.
In mouse, the genomic organization of the serpin family
shows significant differences. The cluster of genes corresponding to human chromosome 14q32 is mapped on
the chromosome 12F1 [22]. Both α1-protease inhibitor
and contrapsin genes had undergone considerable expansion in this genome. The mouse α1-protease inhibitor (α1antitrypsin – SERPINA1) cluster comprises 5 members.
The multigenic cluster corresponding to contrapsin (α1antichymotrypsin – SERPINA3) is termed the Spi-2 locus
[23] and, until recently, was thought to encompass 14
members [24] with a degree of overall sequence similarity
of 65 to 80%, despite markedly divergent RCL domains.
Some of these genes present a significant degree of
sequence homology with the single-copy human
SERPINA3 gene [25]. However, the RCL was substantially
different. In mouse genome, these two clusters represent
the result of multiple gene duplication events.
In the pig, four serine protease inhibitors were detected at
the protein level: PI1 (SERPINA1), PI2 (SERPINA3-1), PI3
and PI4 (SERPINA3 paralogues) [26-28]. PI1 and PI2 corresponding genes were mapped by radioactive in situ
hybridization (RISH) to the distal end of chromosome
7q23-26 [29,30]. A complete cDNA, named SERPINA3-1,
corresponding to PI2 and a gene, named SERPINA3-2,
were sequenced [31] and clearly affiliated to the porcine

α1-antichymotrypsin (SERPINA3) family. Porcine PI2 and
SERPINA3-2 only showed 76% amino acid identity, with
the largest difference near the C-terminus containing the
deduced reactive site P1-P'1.
The knowledge on bovine serpin genes is much more
restricted. Hwang et al. [32] identified a serpin, previously
named Endopin1, at the cDNA level, in bovine endocrine
chromaffin cells. The same serpin was then purified from
bovine skeletal muscle [33]. This serpin (mEndopin1A)
was found to be essentially intracellular and widely distributed in bovine tissues suggesting that this protein
might have central biological role in a large set of tissues
[34]. More recently, a second endopin, named
mEndopin1B, was purified from bovine diaphragm and
the genes encoding mEndopin1A and mEndopin1B were
characterized [35].
In order to clarify the complexity surrounding the bovine
SERPINA3 genes, we describe here the isolation, the complete sequence and the genomic organization of the
bovine α1-antichymotrypsin (SERPINA3) multigenic cluster. This cluster was assigned to chromosome 21 using a
radiation hybrid panel. In addition, we provide preliminary expression data on the bovine SERPINA3 genes.
Characterization of these new genes and phylogenetic
analysis of the corresponding proteins provide new
insights on the evolution of SERPINA3 gene cluster. We
also propose a nomenclature to designate all the members
of this clade.

Results
Southern blot analyses of SERPINA3 genes
Genomic DNA extracted from bovine blood cells was
digested to completion with NciI, NcoI and SacI endonucleases. After transfer on a Hybond-N+ membrane, DNA
was hybridized with a radiolabelled probe corresponding
to a part of exon 2 of mEndopin 1A gene [GenBank:
AY911536]. After washing under high stringency conditions, several fragments of variable intensity were detected
for each endonuclease digest as showed in Figure 1A. A
minimum of four hybridizing bands was observed for
each DNA digestion. In particular, five bands with variable intensity were obtained using SacI. Several fragments
were also observed with an additional experiment performed on isolated BAC DNA (see below) treated in the
same conditions (Figure 1B). These Southern blot patterns
are consistent with the existence of more than the two
genes mEndopin1A and mEndopin1B previously described
[35]. It suggests a complex organization in the bovine
genome with more than a round of duplication during
evolution from one ancestral SERPINA3 gene.

Molecular cloning of bovine SERPINA3 genes
A bovine genomic BAC library was screened by PCR with
the set of primers described in Methods section. Four positive BAC clones, named bI0123B08, bI0511D06,
bI0311E07 and bI0382C01, were identified. Only
bI0123B08 and bI0511D06 BAC DNAs were then subjected to long-range PCR with two sets of primers (see
methods).

After cloning of the PCR products, several positive clones
with inserts ranging from 7.0 to 8.0 Kb were identified
with a first set of primers corresponding to the 5' and 3'
ends of the mEndopin1A cDNA sequence. Restriction mapping using different endonucleases revealed six different
profiles. Two of them were first analyzed and assigned to
mEndopin1A and mEndopin1B proteins, which were
already found and purified from bovine skeletal muscle
[35]. In our new proposal of nomenclature, the corresponding genes are named SERPINA3-1 [GenBank:
AY911536] and SERPINA3-3 [GenBank: AY911537],
respectively. The four other fragments were also analyzed,
sequenced on both strands using several sense and antisense primers as previously described [35] and assigned to
four new genes: SERPINA3-2 [GenBank: EF153626],
SERPINA3-4 [GenBank: EF153627], SERPINA3-5 [Gen[GenBank:
Bank: EF153628] and SERPINA3-6
EF153629].
Three clones with different restriction profiles were
obtained with a second set of primers corresponding to
the 5' end of the SERPINA3 EST [GenBank: DT861683]
and the 3' end of the endopin2B cDNA sequence [GenBank: AY386699] published by Hwang and collaborators
[36]. The clones were sequenced on both strands and
assigned to SERPINA3-7 [GenBank: EF153630],
SERPINA3-8 [GenBank: EF153631] and SERPINA3P
[GenBank: EF153625]. Comparison of these genomic
DNA sequences, using the online software Spidey [37],
with the SERPINA3-1 cDNA allowed us to deduce the
gene structures. Sizes of exons and introns, as well as
exon/intron junctions, were determined. Genes are split
into five exons (exon 1 to exon 5) and four introns (intron
1 to intron 4), as presented in Figure 2A. Figure 2B shows
the sizes of exons and introns for the first eight bovine
SERPINA3 genes. These genes have a good conservation of
the introns and exons size, except for the intron 2 of
SERPINA3-1 and SERPINA3-2, which is due to the insertion of a Bov-B LINE. Finally, for all these genes, the translation initiation codon ATG is located in exon 2, few base
pairs downstream intron 1/exon 2 boundary and the stop
codon TAG is found in exon 5. Due to the conserved gene
organization of class 2 serpins (five exons and four
introns), a potential pseudogene (SERPINA3P) was also
identified. Compared to the other SERPINA3 cDNAs,
SERPINA3P gene is partially truncated at the end of the

exon 3 and the beginning of the exon 4. In addition a 13
bp deletion in exon 2 induces a frame shift which generates a premature stop codon TGA at position 2289 in exon
2. Figure 2B indicates also the size of isolated mRNAs for
SERPINA3-1 and SERPINA3-3, and of deduced mRNAs for
SERPINA3-2, SERPINA3-4, SERPINA3-5, SERPINA3-6,
SERPINA3-7 and SERPINA3-8.
Localization and genomic organization of bovine
SERPINA3 genes
SERPINA3 genes localization within the bovine genome
was performed using a radiation hybrid (RH) panel. The
Roslin 3000-rad RH panel [38] was screened by PCR using
primers able to amplify a specific DNA fragment of 477 bp
in exon 2. Results revealed a single localization on bovine

chromosome 21 between ILSTS054 (635 cR) and
IDVGA39 (658 cR) markers. The use of a first generation
bovine BAC-based physical map [39] showed that the
four BAC clones previously isolated were contained in the
single BAC contig 2018 [40] and covered approximately
235 Kb (Figure 3). Using the publicly available 6× bovine
genomic sequence assembly (Btau_2.0) [41], we confirmed the RH localization and assigned the bovine
SERPINA3 genes to the region 21q24. Comparisons of
DNA sequences allocate some of our sequenced genes to
predicted genes in Btau_2.0, like SERPINA3-1 to
SERPINA3, SERPINA3-3 to LOC615103, SERPINA3-5 to
LOC617667, SERPINA3-7 to LOC497203, SERPINA3-8 to
LOC505820 and SERPINA3P to LOC526738. The
genomic organization of the nine bovine SERPINA3 genes

was deduced from these results and the BAC Southern
blot analysis (Figure 3). Allocated genes are localized on
two distinct sequence contigs in bovine build 2.0 genome
(NW_930022 and NW_930023) and covered up to 1.5
Mb. The relative positions of SERPINA3-1/SERPINA3-2
and SERPINA3-3/SERPINA3-4 were not yet elucidated.
Moreover, we only succeeded in localizing the SERPINA5
gene upstream SERPINA3-1 in bI0123B08 BAC clone
using the MARC_10319-10320 STS [UniSTS: 267110].
Analysis of deduced SERPINA3 protein sequences
The deduced amino-acid primary sequences of these eight
bovine SERPINA3 genes indicated that protein sizes range
from 411 to 418 amino acids. Different numbers of
potential N-glycosylation sites (N-X-S/T with X neither P)

were present (Figure 4). The bovSERPINs A3-1/A3-2/A33/A3-4 and A3-5 have very similar sequences with 95% of
identity and separate from bovSERPINA3-7 and A3-8,
only sharing 74% of identity with them. Based on protein
alignment, a sub-group of bovSERPINA3 could be distinguished. It is composed of bovSERPINA3-1,
bovSERPINA3-2, bovSERPINA3-3, bovSERPINA3-4 and
bovSERPINA3-5. The membership of the bovSERPINA3-6
is much more ambiguous. As seen in Figure 4, this protein
shares more resemblance with that sub-group in its C-terminal part, but its N-terminal part is closer to
bovSERPINA3-7 and bovSERPINA3-8.

Structure of the SERPINA3 locus on Bos taurus chromosome 21
Figure 3
Structure of the SERPINA3 locus on Bos taurus chromosome 21. The genes are labelled according to the classification
in Figure 2B. Their names are indicated in bold characters and the names of loci established for Btau-2.0 genomic sequence
assembly are added (when known) below between brackets. The different genes are localized on the four overlapping BAC
clones covering approximately 235 Kb. The two question marks indicate the uncertainties of relative location for the genes
SERPINA3-1/SERPINA3-2 and SERPINA3-3/SERPINA3-4, respectively. The SERPINA5 gene is also shown.

Preliminary RT-PCR analysis of bovine SERPINA3 genes
RT-PCR was used to determine the presence of SERPINA3
mRNAs in bovine skeletal muscles (semitendinous and diaphragma) and also in liver and kidney. Because of the high
homology between the eight SERPINA3 genes only three
primer pairs were used (see methods).

RT-PCR, with the primer set SERPINA3-1/F, SERPINA3-1/
R, amplified 319 bp fragments in all tested tissues (data
not shown). Two different sequences were obtained. The
first sequence is present in all tested tissues and would
correspond to SERPINA3-1 and/or SERPINA3-2 transcripts, which could not be discriminated by this portion
of sequence. The second sequence is only present in the
liver. It would correspond to SERPINA3-3, SERPINA3-4
and/or SERPINA3-6 transcripts, which could not be discriminated by this portion of sequence.
Primers SERPINA3-6/F, SERPINA3-6/R and primers
SERPINA3-5/F, SERPINA3-5/R allowed to amplify a DNA
fragment only in the liver. Surprisingly, with the primer
pair SERPINA3-6/F, SERPINA3-6/R, after sub-cloning,
amplifying and sequencing, a single sequence corresponding to the SERPINA3-7 mRNA was obtained. This
RT-PCR was supposed to generate a specific amplification
of SERPINA3-6 transcript. However, if SERPINA3-6 cDNA
is one of the minor isoforms of bovine SERPINA3 in liver,
it may not be detected by RT-PCR. With the primers
SERPINA3-5/F and SERPINA3-5/R, several sequences
were obtained. They are related to SERPINA3-3,
SERPINA3-4 and SERPINA3-5 cDNAs but are different
from the other cDNAs of the SERPINA3 family.

Proteomic analysis of muscular bovine SERPINA3
According to the Western blot carried out after 2D-gel
electrophoresis of the Sephadex G100 F1 fraction (Figure
5), the antibody revealed series of spots with at least three
different molecular weights and ranging from 70 to 80
KDa. The calculated relative mass (Mr) of the eight
deduced proteins is 46 KDa. The difference of electrophoretic profile could be explained by different levels of
glycosylation. Each initial spot with different Mr spreads
out on the pH gradient indicating a large variation in the
extent of phosphorylations of different isoforms. Their pI
values vary from 6 to 4.5. For each Mr, the spots probably
correspond to a set of bovSERPINA3 isoforms which are
not resolved in the present conditions. For information,
the position of the two purified isoforms including
bovSERPINA3-1 (70 KDa) and bovSERPINA3-3 (75 KDa)
are indicated in Figure 5. The present results clearly demonstrate that a relatively large set of bovSERPINA3 are
expressed in skeletal muscle.
Phylogenetic analyses of SERPINAs
Analyses were performed on the deduced amino acid
sequences. BovSERPINA3 phylogeny based on maximum
likelihood (Figure 6A) illustrates a complex situation
among this sub-family. Three pairs of sequences (A3-1/
A3-2, A3-3/A3-4 and A3-7/endopin2B) are recognized
with high bootstrap proportions (BPs), ranging from 84%
to 100%. They would be the result of very recent gene
duplications in the Bos taurus genome, which would be
supported by their proximity on the chromosome 21. A
dichotomy is seen, which separates the endo1 group
(named according to endopin1) including bovSERPINA3-

Discussion

1 to A3-6, from the endo2 group (named from endopin2)
including bovSERPINA3-7, A3-8, endopin2B and 2C. Relative orders of emerging within endo1 group are not
resolved (BPs ranging from 58% to 68%), but
bovSERPINA3-6 is very likely to be part of this group even
if the N-terminal part of its amino acid sequence showed
more similarities with bovSERPINA3-7 and A3-8. Finally,
the degree of sequence divergence within the endo1 group
is lower than in the endo2 one.

Two bovine serpins named mEndopin1A (renamed here
bovSERPINA3-1) and mEndopin1B (renamed here
bovSERPINA3-3) were recently purified from diaphragma
and characterized [33,35]. Although the sequence identity
between both muscle endopins is close to 93%, the major
differences were found within the RCL. These two proteins are homologous to the unique human SERPINA3
and share with it a high identity (approximately 67%).
The genes encoding these two proteins were shown to be
expressed notably in muscle. In this study, we show that
bovSERPINA3-1 and bovSERPINA3-3 are members of a
family comprising at least six other deduced proteins. The
genes encoding these proteins are mapped to the presently named SERPINA3 cluster localized on chromosome
21q24. Our results indicate that the locus spans over ~235
Kb and contains at least eight SERPINA3 genes with a
local order of SERPINA3-1/SERPINA3-2, SERPINA3-6,
SERPINA3-3/SERPINA3-4, SERPINA3-7, SERPINA3-5 and
SERPINA3-8, and the pseudogene SERPINA3P localized at
the 3'end of the cluster. We also mapped another SERPINA gene, SERPINA5 at the 5' end of SERPINA3-1/
SERPINA3-2. This mapping is not in agreement with the
publicly available Btau_2.0 genomic sequence assembly.
To correlate with our proposed genomic organization
based on the physical map [39], it was necessary to invert
the relative positions of the two contigs (NW_930022 and
NW_930023) on chromosome 21. However, all the genes
identified in this work had not been listed in Btau 2.0
assembly. To date, the SERPINA3-2, SERPINA3-4 and
SERPINA3-6 genes are not identified in the whole genome
shotgun sequence data. This absence is probably caused
by the high degree of similarity between bovine
SERPINA3 genes. The current Btau 3.1 [41] doesn't clarify
the situation. Indeed, the allocated genes are still the same
but are now localized on two contigs distant of 2 Mb from
each other (NW_001494061 and NW_001494063). The
new Btau 4 version, not yet publicly available, might help
us to resolve this discrepancy.

SERPINA3 amino acid sequences were also analysed in
the context of a larger phylogeny (Figure 6B) including the
closest SERPINA families based on BLAST [42] similarities
and recognized as a part of its sub-group 2 by van Gent et
al. [21]. All clades of SERPINA used in this study are supported by high bootstrap values (95 to 100%), except for
SERPINA3 clade due to the highly divergent sequence of
Ornithorhynchus anatinus SERPINA3. Phylogenetic relationships between all clades remain unsolved. However,
one exception with SERPINA7 (thyroxine-binding globulin) and SERPINA9 (centerin) which are clearly sistergroups with BP of 100%. In addition to SERPINA3,
SERPINA5 [43] and SERPINA7 [44] are found in the Bos
taurus genome. However, only for SERPINA3 several
genes are found especially in mouse.

All these genes share an exon-intron organization identical to that of class 2 serpin genes, as established by Ragg
and collaborators [15] with four coding exons and one
untranslated exon. Moreover, they share a high degree of
identity both in exonic and intronic sequences. Therefore,
all these genes established a compact bovine SERPINA3
family with at least eight functional members and one
pseudogene. SERPINA3 gene clusters exist in other mammal genomes. Mus musculus genome (build 37.1 [45])
contains nine expressed SERPINA3 genes and two pseudogenes located on chromosome 12. The deduced proteins display only 55% to 80% of identity. Porcine
SERPINA3 sequence analysis defined at least three
expressed genes [UniGene:55446, UniGene:50917, UniGene:3917] [31] with comparable degree of overall iden-

tity as observed in mice. On the other hand, primate
genomes only possess a single representative SERPINA3
gene, as seen in rhesus macaque, chimpanzee and human,
the latter being located on chromosome 14q32 [16].
We described, for the first time in mammals, a serpin subfamily of eight genes with one sub-group composed of six
very conserved members: SERPINA3-1,SERPINA32,SERPINA3-3,SERPINA3-4,SERPINA3-5 and SERPINA36, with high degree of identity over the full sequences
(from 88 to 99%). Members of the bovine SERPINA3 subfamily arose by recent duplications after divergence from
Sus scrofa and from an ancestral gene, located on the
region 21q24, homologous to the unique primate
SERPINA3 gene. They show a considerable gene clustering
as the mouse ones, but with notable differences. Indeed,
rodent SERPINA3 homologues are grouped into 4 subclades due to three rounds of duplication prior to speciation between mouse and rat. Following duplications,
mainly in mouse, were then lineage-specific [46]. All these
SERPINA3 cluster organizations are analogous to the one
observed at the family level, that is for SERPINA. In case
of human, where 13 members are described, only
SERPINA7 and SERPINA8 are located on different chromosomes, Xq22 and 1q42-43 respectively, whereas all
others are on chromosome 14q32. They probably also
arose by several rounds of duplication within as well as
between chromosomes as already demonstrated for
human ovalbumine-like serpins (SERPINB) [47]. The single clade supported by 100% BP on ML tree clustered
SERPINA7 and SERPINA9, although these most related
members are on distinct chromosomes and present different activities, non-inhibitory and inhibitory respectively.
This suggests that through evolution, the loss of inhibitory
function in some SERPINA occurred several times independently, as seen for SERPINA7 but also for SERPINA6.
Finally, in bovine, although the genome is completely
sequenced, only four sub-families were identified to date,
with SERPINA1, SERPINA3 and SERPINA5 assigned to

chromosome 21 and SERPINA7 probably on chromosome X as all other mammal SERPINA7s.
The potential active domain of serpins, in the C-terminus
loop, contains the reactive site P1-P'1 responsible for the
serpin specificity. In the sub-family of bovSERPINA3
described in this paper, the RCL (Table 1) has been identified by analogy with other members of the superfamily
of serpins. As indicated in this table, boxed residues in
bold characters are strongly conserved between these eight
putative proteins and are specific of inhibitory serpins
[48]. Moreover, for the sub-family including
bovSERPINA3-1 to bovSERPINA3-6, the full RCL
sequence is remarkably conserved with more than 82% of
identity. This high degree of conservation was not found
in mice and porcine SERPINA3s. We suggest that these six
bovine serpins might have a similar peptidase inhibitory
pattern. Indeed, we were already able to establish for the
two serpins, bovSERPINA3-1 and bovSERPINA3-3, purified and characterized from bovine diaphragma muscle, a
similar peptidase inhibitory pattern against the same proteases, elastase and trypsin [35]. These six serpins could
represent an original sub-family of the SERPINA3s in
bovine and not found so far in other mammals.
SERPINA3-7 corresponds to the previously identified
endopins 2A/2B [49,50]. However, despite using specific
set of primers, we could not amplify the third bovine
endopin 2, named 2C [36] on our four different BAC
DNAs.
In mice and porcine, no specific expression analyses have
been conducted on proteins encoded by SERPINA3 genes
of clusters. However, although bovSERPINA3s are very
close, they share differential expression patterns. For
example, SERPINA3-1 is expressed in all tested tissues,
whereas SERPINA3-4 is amplified only in liver. Moreover,
consensus glycosylation sites and the 2D-gel analysis predicted that bovSERPINA3 may be glycoproteins with dif-

The potential RCL within the C-terminus loop is responsible for the specificity of inhibition. It was identified for the eight putative bovSERPINA3s
by analogy with other serpins. Boxed residues in bold characters appeared to be more specific of inhibitory serpins [48]. The boxed arginine
residue (R) for bovSERPINA3-1 to bovSERPINA3-6 could be the P1 residue for trypsin cleavage [33, 35]. The boxed threonine residue (T) for
endopin2B could be the primarily P1 residue for elastase cleavage [49]. Numberings at the two extremities refer to positions in each full sequence.
Dots indicate identical residues compared to those of bovSERPINA3-1 and dashes show gaps in the alignment.

ferent degrees of N-glycosylation. In a previous study [35],
we have already shown that four potential N-glycosylation sites (Asn100,180,230,264) are common to
bovSERPINA3-1 and bovSERPINA3-3. However, an additional site (Asn318) is present in bovSERPINA3-3 and
could account for the slightly higher molecular mass (75
KDa for bovSERPINA3-3 versus 70 KDa for bovSERPINA31) as assessed by SDS-PAGE. So, as indicated in the 2D-gel
Western blot analysis of a partially purified muscle
bovSERPINA3 fraction (Figure 5), several bovSERPINA3s
present various states of phophorylation. Protein phosphorylation is a very important signalling pathway since
this post-translational modification ensured by a large set
of specific Ser/Thr/Tyr kinases, might be essential for the
biological activity of the protein concerned and/or for a
modulation of this activity [51,52]. Those observations
lead us to propose a differential functionality for these
protein isoforms.

Conclusion
Comprehensive analysis of the bovine genome SERPINA3
content combined with phylogenetic clade recognition
has allowed us to characterize one original SERPINA3
gene cluster not identified yet in other mammals. Some of
these eight corresponding proteins were shown to be
expressed in various tissues and differently glycosylated
and/or phosphorylated. This underlines a complex mechanism of regulation for the biological function of bovine
SERPINA3s.
This coherent sub-family of serpins could constitute a
model to study the duplication events and their underlying molecular proceedings at the origin of multigenic families.
Actually, it is interesting to notice that the numerous
SERPINA3s of Bos taurus contrast with the paucity of other
SERPINA sub-families compared to Homo sapiens (5
assigned and 3 predicted in bovine [41] versus 13 in
human).

Methods
Isolation of genomic BACs encoding bovine SERPINA3
genes
A bovine genomic BAC Library [53] was screened at the
Centre de Ressources Biologiques (INRA, Jouy-en-Josas,
France) by PCR for the isolation of the SERPINA3 genes.
PCR was performed in 50 µl volume reaction using the
primers 5'-TGAGGGCAGAGAGAACTTCCTTC-3' and 5'AGGCCTCAGAGGAGTACAGCAC-3', designed with reference to the cDNA sequence of bovine chromaffin cell
Endopin 1 [GenBank: AF125526], 1.5 mM MgCl2, 2.5
Units Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA)
and thermocycling consisting of 94°C for 3 min followed
by 94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s and 72°C for 45 sec for 35

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/151

cycles. DNA from the positive BACs was isolated using a
Qiagen®Large-Construct Kit tip 100 column (Qiagen Inc.,
Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
Subcloning and DNA sequencing
To identify intron/exon boundaries and to provide
sequence of introns and exons of each gene, BAC DNA
was subjected to long-range PCR with the two following
primers pairs: 5'-TGGATCCACTGCCCACATCCCGCTC-3'
and 5'-CTAGGCTTCACTGGGGTTGGTGAC-3' designed
with reference to Bos taurus chromosome 21, reference
assembly (based on Btau_3.1), whole genome shotgun
sequence [GenBank: NC_007319] c52366530-52358602;
5'-AGCATCCGGGCAGGCGGCGGCTCTGGATCCACTGC-3'
and
5'-CTAGGCTTCCTTGGGGTTGGTGACTTTGCCC-3' designed with reference to Bos taurus
chromosome 21, reference assembly (based on Btau_3.1),
whole
genome
shotgun
sequence
[GenBank:
NC_007319] 54262873–54270895. The first set of primers was able to amplify SERPINA3-1 to SERPINA3-6 genes
and the second SERPINA3-7 and SERPINA3-8 genes,
using the Expand Long Template PCR System (Roche
Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). The 50
µl PCR reaction contained 15 pmol of each primer, 2.5
units of DNA polymerase, 25 nmol of each dNTP, 50 ng
of DNA and 2.25 mM MgCl2. Amplifications were performed using the following cycling parameters: one cycle
of denaturation at 94°C for 2 min, followed by 10 cycles
of 10 s at 94°C, 30 s at 61°C, 15 min at 68°C, 20 cycles
of 10 s at 94°C, 30 s at 61°C, 15 min at 68°C, incremented by 20 s at each cycle, followed by a final elongation at 68°C for 10 min. Amplification products were
cloned using the pCR-XL-TOPO vector (Invitrogen)
before sequencing. The complete sequences were
obtained on both strands using several primers as
described previously [35] and genomic organization of
bovine SERPINA3 genes was determined by alignments
using the Sequencher™ 4.1.4 software (GeneCodes Corp.,
Ann Arbor, USA).
Southern blot analysis
Bovine genomic DNA was prepared from blood samples
using the QIAmp Blood kit (Qiagen Inc.). Ten micrograms of bovine genomic DNA and screened BAC DNA
were subjected to digestion with SacI, NcoI and NciI
restriction endonucleases. Fragments were separated
through 0.8% (w/v) agarose gel. DNA was depurinated for
20 min with 0.25 N HCl, denaturated for 30 min with 0.4
N NaOH, and transferred onto a Hybond-N+ membrane
(GE Healthcare, Chalfont St. Giles, UK). A 232-bp probe
was generated by PCR using 5'-TGAGGGCAGAGAGAACTTCCTTC-3'
and
5'-AGGCTATGGAGACACTCAGCG-3' as primers and bovine mEndopin1A
(SERPINA3-1) cDNA as probe. Twenty-five nanograms

were labelled with [32P]dCTP by random priming (Random Primers DNA labeling System, Invitrogen), purified
to avoid unincorporated isotope (QIAquick nucleotide
removal kit, Qiagen Inc.) and was used with a specific
activity of 5.108 cpm/mg. Hybridizations were carried out
for 12 h at 65°C in a buffer containing 10% (w/v) dextran
sulfate, 1% (w/v) SDS, 0.5 M NaCl, and 100 µg of sheared
salmon sperm DNA. Blots were washed three times at
42°C for 10 min each with 2× SSC; 2× SSC 0.1% SDS and
1× SSC 0.1% SDS and then analyzed by PhosphorImager
(Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, USA).
Chromosomal localization of bovine SERPINA3 genes
The localization of SERPINA3 genes was performed using
the Roslin 3000-rad RH panel [38]. The bovine genes were
typed on DNA from the 94 radiation hybrid lines together
with control bovine and hamster DNA by PCR in 96-well
microtitre plate using the set of primers 5'-TGAGGGCAGAGAGAACTTCCTTC-3' and 5'-AGGCCTCAGAGGAGTACAGCAC-3' able to amplify a specific DNA fragment of
477 bp of exon 2. PCR reactions were performed in 20 µl
with 25 ng DNA, 1 pmol of each primer, 50 mM KCl, 10
mM Tris-HCl pH 9.0, 1 µM dNTPs, 0.5 unit of Upti Therm
DNA polymerase (Interchim, Montluçon, France) and 1
mM MgCl2. The PCR was started with 3 min at 94°C followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 55°C, and 45 s
at 72°C for 1 min, with a final incubation at 72°C for 5
min. Reactions were carried out in duplicate. Presence or
absence of the 477 bp PCR product in reactions was determined by 96 well mini-agarose gel electrophoresis. PCR
fragments were visualized by ethidium bromide stained
agarose gels. SERPINA3 genes were assigned to chromosome by analyzing 2-point linkage with mapped loci
using RH mapper [54].
RNA isolation and cDNA analysis
Total RNA was isolated from several frozen bovine tissues
obtained within 1 h post-exsanguination from the local
slaughter house of the INRA Theix Research Centre. Frozen tissue (300 mg aliquots) was pulverized with a polytron (ULTRA-TURRAX® T25 basic IKA®-WERKE),
solubilized in 1 ml of TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen),
extracted with 0.2 ml chloroform, isoamylalcohol (49/1,
v/v) and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The
sample was then centrifuged (12,000 g, 4°C, 15 min) and
the resultant RNA present in the aqueous phase was precipitated by isopropanol and resuspended in 50 µl H2O.

Reverse Transcription was performed from 1 µg total RNA,
in a total volume of 20 µl, using 0.5 µg oligo(dT) primer
(Invitrogen) and 5 units of SuperScript™ II RNase HReverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. The reaction was incubated for 50 min
at 42°C and 15 min at 72°C. cDNAs were stored at -20°C
until use.

First strand cDNA synthesis was followed by PCR conducted with 0.4 mM sense and antisense primers, 1 unit
of Upti Therm DNA polymerase (Interchim) and thermocycling consisting of 1 cycle of 3 min at 94°C followed by
35 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 1 min at 55°C, and 1 min at
72°C, with a final incubation at 72°C for 10 min. Primers
SERPINA3-1/F 5'-CCCATGATGACCCTTGACCT-3' and
SERPINA3-1/R 5'-TACCAGGTCCGCGGTCCCTGTGAT-3'
complementary to SERPINA3-1 up to SERPINA3-6 were
designed to amplify a 319 bp DNA fragment that includes
a part of exon 3 and exon 4. Analogously, primers
SERPINA3-6/F
5'-ACCCCAGAAGAACAGCACAAAGTGACGTCT-3' and SERPINA3-6/R 5'-CTTGTTGTCGCTCACGTGGAACTCTGTCTTC-3'
complementary
to
SERPINA3-6 and primers SERPINA3-5/F 5'-TCCTTCCTCCTGGCCGGGCTCCTGATG-3' and SERPINA3-5/R 5'GAGGATGAAGAGGGCGCTGTCGTTGCTACT-3' complementary to SERPINA3-5 should amplify 615 bp and 797
bp DNA fragments respectively, that includes a part of
exon 2 and exon 3. PCR-generated DNA fragments were
subcloned into the pEasyT-vector (Promega, Madison,
USA) and amplified in TOP10 competent Escherichia coli
cells. DNA inserts of appropriate size (assessed by digestion of the plasmid with appropriate restriction endonuclease) were subjected to automated DNA sequencing as
previously described. For DNA sequencing, we used
reverse T7 and forward SP6 primers that flank the DNA
insert.
2D-gel analysis of a partially purified bovine SERPINA3
fraction
A crude muscle extract first fractionated by differential
centrifugation steps was then concentrated by ammonium sulphate precipitation between 40 and 70 % saturation and the pellet suspended in 50 mM Tris/HCl Buffer
pH 7.5 containing 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM 2-β mercaptoethanol and dialysed overnight against the same buffer. The
dialysed extract was then run on a Sephadex G100 column
(100 × 5 cm) at a flow rate of 24 ml. h-1 [35]. The first fraction inhibiting trypsin (F1) was collected and further analysed by 2D gel electrophoresis as previously described
[55]. Briefly, about 100 µg of proteins were included in a
buffer containing 7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 2% (w/v)
CHAPS, 0.4% (v/v) carrier ampholyte and bromophenol
blue. Samples were loaded onto immobilized pH gradient
strips (pH 5–8, 17 cm, Bio-Rad, Hercules, USA) and isoelectric focusing was performed using a Protean IEF cell system (Bio-Rad). Gels were passively rehydrated for 16 h.
Rapid voltage ramping was subsequently applied to reach
a total of 85 kV.h-1. In the second dimension, proteins
were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gels using Protean II XL system
(Bio-Rad). Gels were Coomassie Blue (colloidal blue)
stained and Western blot was performed.

Western blot analysis
Anti-bovSERPINA3 antibodies raised against purified
bovine mEndopin1 [56] cross-react with all isoforms of
bovine serpins identified in this work and named
bovSERPINA3s. Separated proteins were then transferred
during 40 min at 200 mA onto a nitrocellulose membrane
(Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany). The immunoblot was processed by chemiluminescence detection
(Chemiluminescence Blotting Substrate [POD], Roche
Molecular Biochemicals). After overnight saturation, the
membrane was first incubated with rabbit anti
bovSERPINA3 anti-serum (dilution 1:500) for 1 h at
room temperature under agitation, and then with a second antibody, a swine anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to
horseradish peroxidase (dilution 1:1000) (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) for 40 min at room temperature and
under agitation.

Phylogenetic analysis
Details concerning SERPINAs used for phylogenetic
reconstructions are shown in Table 2. Sequences were
aligned using the program SEAVIEW [57]. Positions
including gaps due to the alignment were removed.
Twelve sequences and 402 positions, and twenty-seven
sequences and 360 positions were retained for phylogenetic analyses of the multigenic sub-family of
bovSERPINA3 and their relationship with other SERPINA
families, respectively. Maximum likelihood trees were
obtained using PHYML version 2.4.4 [58]. We applied the
Jones-Taylor-Thornton (JTT) model of amino acid substitution [59], a site-to-site evolutionary rate variation modeled on a Γ distribution with 4 rate categories and the
shape parameter estimated from the data. The statistical
supports for internal branches were estimated by the non
parametric bootstrap method on 500 replicates.
