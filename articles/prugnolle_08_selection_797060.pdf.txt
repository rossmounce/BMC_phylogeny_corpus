Abstract
Background: Malaria kills more people worldwide than all inherited human genetic disorders
combined. To characterize how the parasites causing this disease adapt to different host
environments, we compared the evolutionary genomics of two distinct groups of malaria pathogens
in order to identify critical properties associated with infection of different hosts: those parasites
infecting hominids (Plasmodium falciparum and P. reichenowi) versus parasites infecting rodent hosts
(P. yoelii yoelii, P. berghei, and P. chabaudi). Adaptation by the parasite to its host is likely highly critical
to the evolution of these species.
Results: Our comparative analysis suggests that patterns of molecular evolution in the hominid
parasite lineage are generally similar to those of the rodent lineage but distinct in several aspects.
The most rapidly evolving genes in both lineages are those involved in host-parasite interactions as
well as those that show the lowest expression levels. However, we found that, similar to their
respective mammal host lineages, parasite genomes infecting hominids are generally less
constrained, evolving at faster rates, and accumulating more deleterious mutations than those
infecting murids, which may reflect an historical lower effective size of the hominid lineage and
relaxed host-driven selective pressures.
Conclusion: Our study highlights for the first time the differences in trends and rates of evolution
in Plasmodium lineages infecting different hosts and emphasizes the potential importance of the
variation in effective size between lineages to explain variation in selective constraints among
genomes.

Background
A number of useful evolutionary parameters can be estimated from between species comparisons of genomewide divergence patterns: the magnitude of positive and
negative (purifying) selection, variation in selection
across different lineages, chromosomes, gene families and

individual genes as well as the number of genes involved
in the speciation process and adaptation to new environments.
Comparative approaches have revealed that genes
involved in immunity or in host defenses tend to exhibit

the highest rate of evolution in the genome of different
species. The arms race between hosts and parasites is generally invoked to explain this rapid evolution of genes
involved in immune defense [1]. Pathogens continuously
evolve to escape the defense of the host and the host, in
turn, responds by modifying its defense. At the molecular
level, this cycle of environmental changes means that new
mutations are continuously tested and fixed by selection
if adaptive, which translates into higher rates of molecular
evolution in genes controlling immunity in the hosts.
While accelerated evolution of genes involved in immunity is common in mammals, the relative rate of evolution
of those genes may vary from one phylogenetic lineage to
another. This is the case for hominids (human and chimpanzee) compared to rodents (mouse and rats) where
genes involved in immune defense show an accelerated
rate of evolution in murids compared to hominids, suggesting that the immune system of murids has undergone
more extensive specific innovations [2].
Hosts belonging to different lineages can therefore represent different environments for parasites to adapt. How
do parasites preferentially infecting different host lineages
respond to these different environments? Do parasites
infecting different host lineages show lineage specific rates
of evolution?
Plasmodium is a practical case study for genome evolution
of parasites specifically infecting different host lineages.
The genomes of two parasite species infecting only hominids (Plasmodium falciparum [3], P. reichenowi [4]) and
three species preferentially infecting rodent hosts (P. yoelii
yoelii, P. chabaudi and P. berghei) [5] are now partially or
completely sequenced. Although these two groups of species might be subject to similar selective pressures acting
either on the genome as a whole or on genes with similar
function across species, some aspects of their genomes,
such as genes associated with evading host immunity,
may evolve in a unique manner.
In this paper we systematically analyze and compare the
rate of evolution of protein-coding genes in the parasites
infecting hominids (hereafter called the hominid parasite
lineage) and in those infecting rodents (rodent or murid
parasite lineage) (Figure 1). We explore and compare the
adaptive rate of evolution of genes in both groups based
on their function and timing or level of expression, factors
that may explain variation in the rate of evolution among
different genes between the different lineages.
As for their two mammal host lineages (i.e. hominids and
rodents) [2], our study reveals, in particular, that the evolution of the hominid lineage parasite genomes was less
constrained than the evolution of those parasites infecting

the murid lineage, which likely reflects a lower effective
population size in hominid parasites (specifically P. falciparum).

Results and Discussion
By taking the complete set of coding genes of P. falciparum
and aligning it to a partial genome shotgun of P. reichenowi (covering approximately 1/3 of the entire genome)
available in PlasmoDB, we identified a set of 843 pairs of
genes with unambiguous orthology for which it was possible to generate high quality sequence alignments covering virtually the entire coding region (see Methods and
Additional file 1). The same procedure retrieved 3060 triplets of orthologues for rodent malaria parasites P. yoelii
yoelii, P. berghei and P. chabaudi, distributed throughout
these genomes (Additional file 2).
Average rates of evolution: evolutionary constraints and
selection on amino-acid sites within the hominid and murid
lineages
Analyzing estimates of ω (dN/dS) in both hominid (ωHominids) and rodent (ωrodents) parasite species independently
made it possible to study how evolutionary constraints
and selection vary across both clades. In the hominid lineage, the average ωHominids was estimated at 0.21 (Table 1),
which is in congruence with previous estimates [4]. This
excludes four genes with estimates of ω higher than 500
that had very low observed dS estimates (including these
4 genes, the average was ~4.68) and five genes with an
undefined ratio (dS = 0). Among the 843 pairs of orthologues analyzed between P. falciparum and P. reichenowi,
only ten pairs displayed a higher ratio than 1 but none
were statistically significant (p-values less than 0.05 as
determined by a likelihood ratio test). Most genes were
conserved with ω significantly lower than one. A total of

Maximum likelihood estimates of the rates of evolution (± standard

The difference between dN/dS in hominid and rodent lineages is
significant. Note that the ratio of the means is not equivalent to the
mean of the ratios.

719 genes, 85% of the genes analyzed, were in fact determined to be under purifying selection with ω significantly
less than one.
The average ω Murids for the 3060 genes analyzed in P. yoelii
yoelii, P. chabaudi and P. berghei, was estimated as 0.13
(Table 1), significantly lower than in parasites infecting
hominids (Wilcoxon test over all genes, p-value < 10-4).
Only 4 genes displayed a ratio greater than 1, but none
were significant. In fact, more than 98% of the genes displayed a ratio significantly lower than 1.
Several observations suggest that the difference observed
between the hominid and the rodent lineage is not due to
the number of species aligned in each lineage nor their
phylogenetic distances. First, the ω obtained between any
pair of rodent parasite species, are similar, and lower than
the estimate obtained for P. falciparum and P. reichenowi
(data from [5]: P. yoelii yoelii and P. chabaudi: ω = 0.11, P.
yoelii yoelii and P. berghei: ω = 0.16 and P. chabaudi and P.
berghei: ω = 0.13). Second, the marked difference between
hominid and rodent malaria parasites still held when
comparisons between lineages are made in a paired way
using only those genes from hominid and rodent lineages
of known orthology (orthology between P. falciparum and
P. yoelii yoelii was retrieved from [6]; Wilcoxon rank sum
test; n (genes) = 263; p-value = 0.002). Therefore, there is
an excess of about 25% of amino-acid altering substitutions, relative to synonymous substitutions, in the hominid lineage compared to the rodent lineage.
Interestingly, the host lineages of these two groups of parasites show similar differences in their rate of molecular
evolution. Hominids show an average ω of 0.20, over the
whole genome, while murids show an average ratio close
to 0.13 [2,7]. As in the case of Plasmodium parasites, the
difference between both estimates is highly significant.
This difference in the rate of molecular evolution among
the host lineages could be the result of two different processes: 1) a relaxation in the selective constraints acting on
the amino-acid sequence in the host hominid lineage, relative to the murid lineage, subsequent to a reduction in

their effective population size or 2) an acceleration in the
global rate of adaptive evolution in hominids. Genetic
evidence favors the first hypothesis [8,2,9]. Does the same
explanation hold for parasites?
Comparing genetic variation at synonymous and nonsynonymous sites within (polymorphism) and between
species (divergence) can help distinguish between the two
hypotheses above [10]. When most variation is neutral,
the ratio of the number of nonsynonymous to synonymous polymorphisms observed within populations
should be the same as the ratio of divergence between species [10]. Mu and collaborators [11] analyzed genomewide polymorphism of 5 P. falciparum isolates distributed
globally. Jeffares and collaborators also analyzed polymorphisms using three different African isolates [4]. In
total, we obtained divergence and polymorphism data for
518 genes using Mu et al [11]'s data and 839 genes using
Jeffares et al. [4]'s data. The ratio of the number of nonsynonymous to synonymous polymorphism was 2.3 for
the first dataset and 2.7 for the second one. Comparatively, the ratio of divergence we observed among P. falciparum-P. reichenowi was only 1.1 and 1.3, respectively,
thus indicating a 2-fold increase in the number of nonsynonymous polymorphisms. Although some amino-acid
substitutions observed among species are likely adaptive,
this observation supports selection being less efficient in
removing segregating deleterious amino-acids in P. falciparum. A reduced effective size in hominid parasites compared to the murid lineage might be one explanation for
the observed difference in ω. This scenario is supported by
different studies suggesting the existence of an historical
low effective population size in P. falciparum[12]. Unfortunately, no such population study exists for rodent
malaria species. The evolution of both hominids and their
malaria parasites appears to be less constrained than that
of murids, which might reflect, for both the host and the
parasite, a small historical effective size and an evolution
mainly driven by slightly deleterious mutations [13].
Variation in evolutionary rates across functionally
different genes
We then asked whether specific groups of genes evolved
differently from the rest of the genome. In particular, we
searched for groups of genes that could have experienced
an accelerated evolution in one lineage compared to the
other, thus leading to a higher difference in their aminoacid substitution rate between lineages than expected
given the difference observed across the genome.

To do so, we searched for variation in ω among different
functional categories of genes. No functional annotation
was directly available for the rodent lineage, so we classified rodent genes using their orthology with P. falciparum
(see methods). Practically, because the amino-acid diver-

gence was, on average, higher in the hominid lineage
compared to the rodent lineage (see above section: Average rates of evolution), we sought categories that showed
a significantly lower or higher difference than expected on
average. To do so, we used the following Linear Model: ω
~ L + Ca + L*Ca + constant, where ω corresponds to the
ratio computed for each gene, L to the lineage (Hominid
or Rodent) and Ca to the category to which the gene
belongs (the category of interest or the rest of the
genome). A difference higher than the average ω for certain categories between the hominid and the rodent lineages should translate into a significant interaction (L*Ca).
We considered only those categories that contained at
least 5 genes in both hominid and rodent lineages. Overall, the ω ratio was correlated among categories between
hominid and rodent lineages (r2 = 0.34; p-value = 0.0019).
We found no category of genes showing an accelerated
evolution in one lineage compared to the other, relative to
the rest of the genome (Fig. 2 and Table 2). Such a result
can be interpreted in several ways. First, categories that
could have been affected by such acceleration were not
included in the analysis because of a lack of data. This
could be the case, for instance, for categories of genes like
those involved in host-parasite interactions like VAR
genes which are not found in rodent parasite genomes. In
our dataset, we had to exclude this category because of an
insufficient number of genes belonging to it. Second, an
evolutionary acceleration in the amino-acid substitution
rate may not affect entire categories of genes but only
some of them expressed, for instance, at only some particular stages of the parasite, thus rendering it more difficult
to detect them.

Variation in evolutionary rates, timing and frequency of
expression
We finally addressed how variation in evolutionary rates
could evolve relative to the timing and the breadth of
expression of the genes. Do genes expressed at a particular
stage show lineage specific evolution?

As shown in Fig. 3A, hominid and rodent genes show similar patterns of evolution relative to their timing of expression. While no significant difference was observed
between categories of genes for hominids (p-value = 0.3),
a difference was found between categories for rodents: (pvalue = 0.013). For both lineages, genes that are expressed
at the merozoite stage look the most constrained while
those expressed at the gametocyte stage appear the least
constrained. We did not find any group of genes showing
an accelerated evolution in one lineage compared to the
other relative to the rest of the genome.
The classification we used for Fig. 3A was nevertheless very
broad. It included genes that were expressed at one particular stage but those same genes could also be expressed at
other stages. Because this could preclude the detection of
stage-specific evolution, we then re-analyzed our data
keeping only the genes that were expressed at one stage.
Doing so, we observed a significant difference in the rate
of evolution among the different categories in the hominid lineage (p-value = 0.017) but no difference was
observed in the rodent lineage (p-value = 0.59, Fig. 3B).
We observed an overall difference between hominid and
rodent parasites primarily due to the loci expressed at the
sporozoite stage that showed an accelerated evolution in
the hominid lineage compared to the rodent one (p-value
= 0.018). This result suggests that genes only expressed at
the sporozoite stage might be key genes in the infection
process of the mammal host by malaria parasites and
experienced higher adaptive evolution in the hominid lineage than in the rodent one.

We then analyzed the relationship between the breadth of
expression and evolutionary rates. Genes expressed at
only one parasitic stage (see methods for details) were
characterized as unique and those expressed at all stages
were characterized as ubiquitous. For both the hominid
and rodent lineages, we observed a significant relationship between the breadth of expression and the rate of
non-synonymous substitutions. On average, stage specific
proteins (expressed at only one stage) evolve at a higher
rate relative to ubiquitous ones (expressed at all stages)
(Fig. 4 and Table 3). In contrast, synonymous variation
shows a very different trend regarding the breadth of
expression. The rate of synonymous substitutions
increases with the breadth of expression: proteins
expressed in a larger number of stages evolve at higher
rates at synonymous sites. The obvious corollary of these

observations is a negative relationship between the
breadth of expression and dN/dS as shown in Figure 4.
Note that we obtained similar relationships for rodents
using data on the expression of P. berghei [5] except that
we did not find any significant relationship between dS
and the breadth of expression (data not shown).
Our results are congruent with previous studies reporting
relationships between breadth of expression and the rate
of gene evolution in other organisms [14,15]. In both
hominid and rodent lineages, highly expressed genes are
generally more constrained than less expressed genes [16].
This observation is often attributed to the fact that proteins that are expressed in more diverse cellular environments are subjected to stronger functional constraints
[14,15,17]. These results are consistent with the observation in both hominid and rodent parasites of a positive
relationship between GC content at position 1 and 2 of
codons (GC1-2) and the level of expression as well as a
negative relationship between GC1-2 and dN/dS (Table
3). Highly and universally expressed genes are more GCrich than lowly expressed genes which might thus reflect a
codon bias, in particular for GC-rich codons. In other

words, amino acids encoded by GC-rich residues are preferred and conserved in protein coding genes of the genus
Plasmodium.
The positive relationship observed between the rate of
synonymous substitutions and expression can potentially
be explained by translational selection acting on synonymous codon sites of highly expressed genes [16]. Alternatively, an increase in transcription may simply increase the
level of spontaneous mutations as demonstrated in certain bacteria [18].

Conclusion
Our knowledge about the evolution of parasites responsible for malaria is increasing rapidly thanks to the availability of several completely sequenced genomes from
species belonging to different lineages. As shown in the
present study, different questions can be directly answered
by comparing genomes from multiple Plasmodium species. Our comparative analysis suggests that, while there
are a few aspects that are distinct among lineages, patterns
of molecular evolution in the hominid parasite lineage
are generally consistent with those observed in the rodent

parasite lineage. In the murid lineage the most rapidly
evolving genes are those involved in host-parasite interactions and those that are the least expressed. However, the
evolution of the hominid lineage appears to be less constrained likely reflecting their historical lower effective
size and an evolution driven by slightly deleterious mutations.
While we tried to be as exhaustive as possible in our comparison of the evolution of the genome of both species,
this study is still imperfect and incomplete. A definitive
study will require the use of a high-quality complete
sequence for P. reichenowi as well as more population data
on the rodent lineages. Analyses of polymorphisms in
natural populations of both hominid and rodent lineages
(in the rodent lineage this information is specifically lacking) is critical to better understand the nature and intensity of selection acting on different categories of genes.

Because for parasites with complex life-cycles (like Plasmodium sp.), the vector and the vertebrate host constitute very
different environment, an interesting analysis would be to
study the evolution of the genes exclusively expressed in
the stages infecting the mammal host versus those only
expressed in the stages infecting the mosquito vector.
Such an analysis would however require the collection of
more detailed expression profiles in both lineages.

Methods
Data sequences and alignments
For rodent malaria species, protein and nucleotide
sequences for annotated genes for P. berghei, P. chabaudi
and P. yoelii yoelii were obtained from The Plasmodium
Genome Resource Database (Plasmodb [19]). Orthologous genes between the three species were obtained with
BlastN using the criterion of best hits with scores of E <
1*10-15 and at least 70% similarity in length. Only the
groups of genes for which only one gene of each species
corresponded to these criteria were conserved. All groups
of coding sequences were aligned using Clustal W version
1.82 [20] (default parameters) using amino acid
sequences followed by back-translation into nucleotides
sequences using the original sequence provided by Plasmodb.

For hominid malaria species, protein and nucleotides
sequences for annotated genes were obtained for P. falciparum only. For P reichenowi, Plasmodb provided only

nucleotide contigs (release 09 July 2004) of a partial
genome shotgun of approximately onefold coverage. The
assembled contiguous sequences cover slightly less than
one third of the P. reichenowi genome. Orthologous genes
between the two species and their alignment were
obtained following several steps. First, P. falciparum and P.
reichenowi orthologues were obtained using BlastN with
scores of E < 1*10-15 and at least 70% similarity in length.
Only groups of genes where we obtained only one gene of
each species were kept. These groups were then aligned
using ClustalW (V. 1.82) using default parameters. All the
alignments were then very carefully checked by eye and
corrected when necessary. Introns were deleted.
Synonymous and non-synonymous substitution rate
analyses
For both the rodent and hominid malaria gene groups,
maximum likelihood estimates of rates of non-synonymous (dN) and synonymous (dS) substitutions, averaged
over all branches, were obtained using PAML version 3.14
[21]. We used a codon-based model of sequence evolution with dN and dS considered as free parameters and the
average nucleotide frequencies estimated from the data at
each codon position (F3 × 4 MG model). The transition/
tranversion bias K was estimated for each group of orthologous sequence. Because estimates of dS > 1 are more
prone to error [22], only genes with dS ≤ 1 were used for
statistical calculations, yielding 843 and 3060 valid orthologues for hominid and rodents malaria groups respectively. For each gene, Likelihood Ratio Tests (LRT) were
used to test whether the estimated dN/dS (ω) ratio differed
significantly from 1 [23]. The tests were performed as
bilateral tests of the hypothesis Ho: dN/dS =1 versus the
alternative hypothesis H1: dN/dS ≠ 1 for each group of
sequence. Twice the difference of the log likelihood estimated for each hypothesis was then compared to a χ2 distribution with one degree of freedom (df).

GC content, the level and timing of expression of genes
and the function of proteins.
The biological process of the annotated proteins of P. falciparum was determined using GO (Gene ontology) annotations. A biological process is a series of events
accomplished by one or more ordered assemblies of
molecular functions. Examples of broad biological process terms are cellular physiological process or signal transduction. Classification of proteins was made using the
software GENERIC GENE ONTOLOGY (GO) TERM MAPPER [24]. Because no such classification was available for
any of the rodent species, P. yoelii yoelii genes were classified as their orthologous P. falciparum genes defined in
The TIGR Plasmodium yoelii yoelii Genome Annotation
Database.
For gene expression, we retrieved the mRNA abundance
for genes of P. falciparum for different stages (rings, trophozoites, shizonts, merozoites, gametocytes and sporozoites) from [25]. For the rodent lineage, information on
expression was available for P. berghei on a lower number
of stages (asexual blood stages, gametocytes, ookinetes,
oocysts and sporozoites) [5]. Such data precluded any
possible rigorous comparison between the two lineages of
parasites because of a lack of overlap between stages analyzed in the hominid and rodent lineages. We therefore
decided to determine the timing of expression of rodent
genes by using their orthology with P. falciparum, simply
considering orthologous genes to be expressed at similar
stages. We computed the breadth of expression for each
gene in each lineage as the total number of different stages
in which a gene is expressed.
GC content was computed using CODONW [26]. GC
content quantifies the proportion of GC inside the gene.
