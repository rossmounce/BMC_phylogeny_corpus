Abstract
Background: FliH is a protein involved in the export of components of the bacterial flagellum and we herein describe the
presence of glycine-rich repeats in FliH of the form AxxxG(xxxG)mxxxA, where the value of m varies considerably in FliH
proteins from different bacteria. While GxxxG and AxxxA patterns have previously been described, the long glycine repeat
segments in FliH proteins have yet to be characterized. The Type III secretion system homologue to FliH (YscL, AscL, PscL, etc.)
also contains a similar GxxxG repeat, and hence the presence of the repeat is evolutionarily conserved in these proteins,
suggesting an important structural role or biological function.
Results: A set of FliH and YscL protein sequences was downloaded from GenBank, and then filtered to reduce redundancy, to
ensure the soundness of the sequences, and to eliminate, as much as possible, confounding phylogenetic signal between individual
sequences by implementing a pairwise 25% sequence identity cut-off. The general features of the glycine-rich repeats in these
proteins were examined, and it was found that the length of these repeat segments varied substantially among FliH proteins but
was fairly consistent for the Type III (YscL) homologue sequences, with values of m ranging from 0 to 12 for FliH and 0 to 2 for
YscL. The amino acid sequence distribution of each of the three positions in the GxxxG repeats was found to differ significantly
from the overall amino acid composition of the FliH/YscL proteins. The high frequency of Glu, Gln, Lys and Ala residues in the
repeat positions, which is not likely indicative of any contaminating phylogenetic signal, suggests an α-helical structure for this
motif. In addition, we sought to determine whether certain pairs of amino acids, in certain pairs of positions, were found
together significantly more often than would be predicted by chance. Several statistically significant correlations were uncovered,
which may be important for maintaining helical stability or for forming helix-helix interactions. These correlations are likely not
of a phylogenetic origin as the originating sequences for the pair correlations are derived from a low similarity set and the
individual incidences of the pair correlations do not cluster in any obvious phylogenetic sense, nor is there much evidence of
strict sequence conservation outside the positions of the glycine residues. Finally, the α-helices from a non-redundant set of
proteins from the Protein Data Bank were searched for GxxxG repeats similar in length to those found in FliH, however there
were no helices containing more than three contiguous glycine repeat segments; thus, long glycine repeats similar to those found
in FliH are presumably quite rare in nature.
Conclusion: The glycine repeats in YscL and particularly FliH represent an intriguing amino acid sequence motif that is very
rare in nature. Although we do not attempt to offer a mechanism whereby these repeats may have evolved, we do place the
existence of the motif and some residue pairings within a rational structural context. While crystal structures of these proteins
are necessary to fully elucidate the structural and functional significance of these repeats, the characterization reported here
represents a first step in understanding this unique sequence feature.

Background
The bacterial flagellum is an apparatus that projects outward from the cell membrane, and employs rotation of a
flexible filament attached to a universal joint (the hook)
for propulsion. The flagellum is made up of four components: the basal body, which houses the flagellar rotary
motor and export apparatus; the rod, which spans the
periplasm, peptidoglycan, and outer membrane; the
hook, which acts as a universal joint; and the filament,
which acts as the propulsion device (reviewed in [1,2]). In
order to construct a functional flagellum, the constituent
proteins must first be synthesized in the cytoplasm and
then be transported to their site of incorporation in a temporally and spatially regulated manner. A specialized Type
III secretion system called the flagellar export apparatus is
used to transport the individual components of the flagellum across the two cell membranes of gram-negative bacteria [1]. The bacterial flagellar export apparatus (reviewed
in [1,2]) is composed of a number of proteins, including
two integral membrane proteins FlhA and FlhB, that also
contain globular cytoplasmic domains, four additional
integral membrane proteins FliO, FliP, FliQ, and FliR, and
two membrane-associated cytoplasmic proteins, FliH and
FliI. Other structural components of the flagellar basal
body (FliF), and C-ring (FliG, FliM, FliN) are also required
for flagellum assembly. In addition, enteric gram-negative
bacteria have a number of substrate-specific chaperones
associated with the flagellar export apparatus (e.g. FlgN,
FliT, FliS, FliJ). These proteins act in concert with the flagellar export ATPase FliI in translocating partially unfolded
substrates, such as the filament component flagellin, in an
export-competent state through the basal body pore.
Ultrastructural and biochemical investigations of the flagellar basal body and the Type III secretion system indicate
that these systems have evolved from a common ancestor
[3,4]. In support of these observations, most of the flagellar export components have conserved orthologues (ranging from 20–40% pairwise identity) in the Type III
secretion system of gram-negative pathogenic bacteria
[5,6], including FliI (InvC, HrcN etc.), FliH (YscL), FliN
(HrcQB), and FlhA (SctV) [7-11].
Functions and molecular interactions similar to their flagellar counterparts have been demonstrated for some of
the Type III export proteins (e.g. InvC to FliI, HrcQB to
FliN, YscL to FliH) [7-13], and are generally assumed for
the other components. For example, the Salmonella and H.
pylori FliH proteins have been shown to interact with the
highly conserved FliI ATPase [12-18] and the flagellar
rotor C-ring protein FliN is also known to interact with
FliH in Salmonella [9,13]. In Type III secretion systems, the
FliH homologue (e.g. YscL) has been shown to interact
specifically with the respective FliI homologue (e.g.
YscN), as well as the corresponding FliN homologue,
HrcQB [7-9,12]. Salmonella FliH forms an elongated

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/72

dimeric structure in solution [16,18], and forms a
(FliH)2FliI complex [16]. Residues 100–235 of Salmonella
FliH are required for interaction with FliI, residues 101–
141 of FliH are required for FliH dimerization, and FliH
N-terminal residues contribute to binding to the enterobacterial flagellar chaperone FliJ [17]. In addition residues
spanning amino acids 60–100 of FliH appear important
for inhibition of FliI ATPase activity as deletion of residues
60–100 enhances FliI ATPase activity in vitro [17]. Furthermore, deleting either residues 70–80 or 90–100 of Salmonella FliH reduce the magnitude of FliI ATPase inhibition
[17]. However, it is unclear how amino acids spanning
residues 60–100 of Salmonella FliH affect FliI ATPase activity, although inhibition appears to be non-competitive in
the related Type III system [19]. Furthermore, a conserved
AxxxG(xxxG)mxxxA motif, which is the focus of this
report, spans residues 59–94 in Salmonella FliH (Figures 1,
2 and 3), suggesting that these FliH GxxxG repeats may
have a role in FliI ATPase regulation. In addition, the precise role of FliH in flagellar protein secretion is not presently understood. A recent study examining the motility
of bacteria with mutant flagellar proteins found that FliInull mutants are non-motile, FliH-null mutants are
weakly motile, and, interestingly, that FliI/FliH double
mutants displayed greater (but still impaired) motility
than FliI-null mutants after extended incubation [20].
Motivated by the realization that the mode of interaction
between FliI and FliH is strikingly similar to that of the Nterminal α-helix of the F1 ATPase α-subunit with the globular domain of the F1 ATPase δ-subunit [18], we have previously suggested that FliH may function as a molecular
stator in combination with FliI during the export of flagellum components [18]. In support of this idea, we and
other researchers have noted weak but significant
sequence similarity between FliH/YscL and the b-subunit
of FoF1 ATPases ([7,21]; S. Moore, unpublished results).
The present study investigates a conserved GxxxG (where
"x" represents any amino acid) sequence motif unique to
the flagellar FliH/YscL family of proteins. Naming conventions for YscL-like proteins are rather inconsistent, as
this protein often has different names in different organisms; for ease of reference, all YscL-like proteins will be
referred to in this paper simply as "YscL". An alignment of
the complete sequences of a representative group of FliH
and YscL sequences along with a schematic domain
organization is provided in Figures 1, 2 and 3. The
extreme N-terminal region of FliH is very poorly conserved, but some sequence conservation is evident in the
various bacterial groups (e.g. enterobacteria, epsilon proteobacteria), but not the YscL protein family. A GxxxG segment of variable length follows, then a poorly conserved
segment likely to be helical in structure, followed by a
well-conserved C-terminal domain known to be responsi-

Primary Sequence of FliH and YscL – schematic representation of domain organization in FliH and YscL proteins. A flagellum specific region at the N-terminus of FliH which has no correspondence to YscL is shown in gold. An N-terminal YscL-unique segment is shown in green and labelled I. The glycine rich segments described in the text are coloured gold
and labelled Gly. The green segment labelled II corresponds to a segment in FliH and YscL homologues found to be similar to
the F1 ATPase b-subunits [21]. The red segment labelled III is unique to FliH and YscL. The orange segment labelled δ-C is proposed by Pallen and co-workers to be homologous to the delta subunit (AtpF) of F1 ATPase [21].

ble for the interaction with the N-terminus of the flagellar/Type III ATPase (Figures 1, 2 and 3).
When we noticed the presence of conserved consecutive
GxxxG repeats in FliH/YscL, we asked if this motif had
been previously observed in other types of proteins. Lemmon et al. [22] first discovered that specific interactions
are required for the transmembrane helix-helix dimerization of glycophorin A. It was later shown that dimerization was mediated by a GxxxG-containing motif [23]. The
GxxxG motif has been identified as the dominant motif in
the transmembrane regions of hundreds of proteins
[24,25], and appears to play a critical role in the stabilization of helix-helix interactions. Such motifs were subsequently observed in many soluble proteins [26]. The
amino acid composition of the variable positions in the
glycine repeats of soluble proteins is certain to be very different from that of transmembrane proteins; transmembrane proteins would contain mostly hydrophobic
residues in the variable positions of the repeats, while the
variable positions in soluble proteins would contain
mostly hydrophilic residues. As such, the only commonality between glycine repeats in transmembrane proteins
and glycine repeats in soluble proteins is likely to be the

glycines found at every fourth residue. As glycine lacks a
side chain, it is suitable for allowing the close packing of
helices, and could hence facilitate helix-helix dimerization.
Most annotated FliH sequences contain a segment of
repeats of the form AxxxG(xxxG)mxxxA, where m can vary
on average between 2 and 10 depending on the bacterial
species. While there is some variation to this pattern, not
all sequences contain the N-terminal-side Axxx or the Cterminal-side xxxA, and FliH proteins from some species
have no GxxxG repeats at all. Nevertheless, a significant
proportion (44% in our set of sequences) of FliH proteins
extracted from the non-redundant sequence database (see
Methods) do exhibit the AxxxG(xxxG)mxxxA pattern. In
addition to this long AxxxG(xxxG)mxxxA repeat segment,
most FliH proteins also contain one or more shorter
repeat segments elsewhere in the primary sequence (Figures 1, 2 and 3), which usually contain just a single AxxxG,
GxxxG, or GxxxA. These shorter repeat segments are very
poorly conserved, do not contain an obvious preference
for particular amino acids at any of the three middle nonglycine positions, and often contain proline. Hence, these
non-conserved GxxxG segments are unlikely to be either

helical or biologically significant. To differentiate the two
patterns, we will refer to the longest repeat segment in a
particular FliH protein as its "primary repeat segment".
YscL proteins exhibit similar patterns, except that they
generally have shorter primary repeat segments.
We report here a statistical characterization of the amino
acids composing the variable positions in the primary
repeat segments of a varied collection of FliH and YscL
sequences from different bacterial species. As they are analyzed separately, the specific portion of the repeat segments being discussed – AxxxG, GxxxG, or GxxxA – will be
referred to as the "repeat type". Additionally, we make the
distinction between the first, second, and third variable
residue in a given repeat, which will be denoted as positions x1, x2, and x3, respectively. Below, we describe the
analysis performed on FliH, which is of primary interest
due to its uniquely long primary repeat segments. Some of
the analysis described below was also performed for YscL;
full details are provided in the Results and Methods sections.

To provide a general characterization of the glycine
repeats in FliH, some initial data were gathered, such as
the number of proteins having a repeat segment flanked
by Axxx and xxxA, and the lengths of the primary repeat
segments in each sequence. Next, secondary structure prediction programs were employed to predict whether the
glycine repeat segments are likely to adopt a helical conformation, as would be expected given the amino acid
compositions of these repeats, as well as previous results
concerning the role of glycine repeats in helix-helix dimerization. A multiple alignment of the glycine repeat segments of FliH and YscL was then created, which provides
insight into how FliH/YscL proteins from different bacterial species relate to each other in terms of the length and
composition of their primary repeat segments. The distribution of amino acids in the three variable positions in
each repeat type was then determined. We hypothesized
that the amino acid frequencies in the glycine repeats
would differ significantly from the amino acid frequencies
in the entirety of all the FliH/YscL proteins; to provide
support for this hypothesis, statistical tests were used to

determine the probability that any differences found
could have occurred by chance. To ensure that the tabulated amino acid frequencies and positional correlations
were not simply the result of high sequence similarity due
to sampling sequences that are phylogenetically closely
related (especially in the GxxxG segment), we employed
an overall 25% amino acid sequence identity cut-off to filter out highly similar FliH sequences and select an approximately even sampling of the available FliH sequences.
This results in very little observable sequence similarity
throughout the aligned FliH sequences that were ultimately selected for the analysis (essentially no absolutely
conserved residues and only a few highly conserved residues, see Additional files 1 and 2). For the GxxxG motif
region, there is always going to be evidence of phylogenetic signal due to the strongly conserved glycine residues
(30.7% identical for GxxxGxxxGxxxG) and there is certainly some conservation in the lengths of the repeats in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/72

sequences that are more closely related (Figures 4 and 5).
However, the imposed 25% sequence identity cutoff in
our data analysis has filtered most of the apparent
sequence similarity in the variable regions of the repeat.
This can be seen by comparing the similarity between any
two aligned sequences both within the repeat region (Figure 5) and outside of the repeats (see Additional files 1
and 2). For FliH, we calculated correlation coefficients
between all possible pairs of amino acids, in all possible
combinations of positions in the repeats, and used statistical methods to determine whether certain pairs of amino
acids in specific positions are found together significantly
more often than would be expected by chance. We
hypothesized that certain pairs of amino acids in nearby
positions, such as positions within the same repeat, or in
adjacent repeats, would be highly correlated, while amino
acids in positions farther away from each other would be
unlikely to be strongly correlated, and that the correla-

tions are due to selective pressure imposed by structural
constraints on the GxxxG motifs. For instance, in α-helices, there is a well known incidence of oppositely charged
residues (for example glutamate and lysine) occurring in
i, i+4 or i, i+3 pairs, therefore forming stabilizing intrahelical salt bridges, and these are typically not highly conserved interactions. Rather they appear to be the result of
random mutations and selective pressures to stabilize
nearby charged residues within the context of the helical
structure. Similar results have been found for pair correlations in β-sheets [37].
Finally, we sought to determine how prevalent long glycine repeats are in other types of proteins not related to
FliH, and to identify a protein of known three-dimensional structure that contains a FliH-like repeat segment
that is involved in helix-helix dimerization. To address
both goals, a large number of protein structures were
downloaded from the Protein Data Bank (PDB; http://
www.rcsb.org/pdb). These structures were searched for
the presence of helices with glycine repeats, and one protein with a FliH-like glycine repeat segment was chosen as
a molecular model for the types of interactions that might
occur in FliH proteins.
The work presented here represents a comprehensive
characterization of a relatively unusual primary sequence
pattern. While this study focuses mainly on FliH/YscL and
their glycine repeat segments, the results should also add
to our understanding of the general characteristics of glycine repeat-containing α-helices in water-soluble proteins.

Results
Sets of proteins acquired
FliH proteins and YscL proteins were downloaded and filtered as described in the Methods section to obtain a set
of FliH sequences and a set of YscL sequences where no
sequence was more than 25% identical to any other
sequence. After filtering, 50 FliH sequences and 16 YscL
sequences remained.
Initial characterization of glycine repeat segments
Initially, some general data regarding the composition of
the 50 chosen FliH sequences were gathered. The average
number of GxxxGs found in a primary repeat segment was
2.84, with a standard deviation of 2.53; the fewest
number found in this set was 0, while the greatest number
was 10. (In describing the length of a sequence's primary
repeat segment, we include only GxxxGs; AxxxGs and
GxxxAs are not included in the total). Although the longest repeat found in this dataset was 10, there exist FliH
sequences with even longer repeats. For instance, the FliH
from E. coli strain 53638 (GenBank accession number
EDU66533) contains a repeat of length 12; however, this

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/72

sequence was excluded when imposing the 25% identity
sequence cut-off. A histogram showing the number of
FliH sequences having primary repeat segments of different lengths is given in Figure 4. The majority of sequences
have repeats with a length of 3 or less, while a few
sequences have much longer repeats. Interestingly, the
distribution of the lengths of the primary repeat segments
in a set of 167 FliH sequences for which no sequence is
more than 90% identical to any other sequence is very
similar to that shown in Figure 4, indicating that bias arising from high sequence similarity in the available FliH
sequences used has little effect on the results. This histogram is available as Additional file 3. In contrast to FliH,
the primary repeat segments of YscL were much more uniform in length. Five sequences had no repeat segment at
all, while 7 sequences had a repeat of length 1 and 4
sequences had a repeat of length 2. This stark difference in
the distribution of the repeat lengths between FliH and
YscL invites speculation concerning the importance of the
repeat in these two proteins. As FliH apparently experiences selection pressure for longer repeats, but YscL does
not, it suggests that longer repeats are advantageous to the
function of FliH, but not to YscL; however, the nature of
this difference is unclear.
Of the FliH sequences that had at least one GxxxG (a total
of 44 sequences), the repeat segments of 22 sequences
were flanked by both an Axxx on the N-terminal side and
an xxxA on the C-terminal side. A lower number (13
sequences) contained only an initial Axxx, while few
sequences had only an xxxA at the end (4 sequences) or
neither an N-terminal-side Axxx nor a C-terminal-side
xxxA (5 sequences). It thus appears that the initial Axxx is
more strongly conserved than the terminating xxxA. Just
two of the YscL sequences contained repeats with both the
initial AxxxG and the terminal GxxxA, and an equal
number (4 each) contained only the initial AxxxG or only
the terminal GxxxA.
Secondary structure prediction
Several secondary structure prediction programs were
used to predict the secondary structure of the primary
repeat segments of selected FliH and YscL proteins, and
the prediction programs consistently and convincingly
classified these regions as α-helical for all of the proteins
tested. The tools used are given in [27-31]. Thus, there is a
strong basis for interpreting the sequence characteristics of
the glycine repeat segments as being important either for
helical stability, or for making helix-helix interactions.
Multiple alignment of the glycine repeats
We have performed a multiple alignment of the glycine
repeats in both FliH (Figure 5) and YscL (Figure 6) to illustrate the composition of their repeat segments. The alignment was essentially carried out by hand and forces both

the initial (Axxx or Gxxx) and terminal (xxxA or xxxG)
motif to be in the same register. One interesting observation in Figure 5 is that sequences with shorter repeats
appear to be more likely to have the initial Axxx and the
terminating xxxG than sequences with longer repeats, suggesting that longer repeats may compensate in some way
for the absence of the alanine "caps".
Calculating the amino acid distribution in the primary
repeat segments
After this initial characterization of the glycine repeats, we
then sought to determine the frequency of each amino
acid in each position of each repeat type. Figures 7 and 8
give these data for all three repeat types in FliH, and just
for GxxxGs in YscL (the sample size of AxxxGs and GxxxAs
in YscL is too small to justify making inferences about the
distribution of amino acids in the variable positions).
While the frequencies reported in Figures 7 and 8 certainly
appear to diverge significantly from what one might consider to be a "normal" distribution of amino acids, we
confirmed this observation statistically. A χ2 test was used
to determine whether the amino acid frequencies in each

position – repeat-type combination was significantly different than the amino acid frequencies in the entirety of
all the FliH proteins. The x1, x2, and x3 positions in both
AxxxGs and GxxxGs all had P-values less than 10-30, while
those same positions for GxxxAs had P-values of 1.4 × 103, 1.8 × 10-9, and 9.0 × 10-17 respectively. For YscL, the Pvalues for all three variable positions in the GxxxG repeats
were less than 10-29 (again, we do not comment on the
distribution of the variable positions in YscL AxxxGs and
GxxxAs due to the small sample size). Thus, it can readily
be seen that the amino acid distribution in the primary
repeat segments is significantly different than the overall
composition of the FliH/YscL sequences. Moreover, it is
unlikely these frequencies are simply the product of phylogenetic signal as the sequence similarity between the
proteins in the dataset is minimal, especially in the variable residues of the GxxxG repeats (the glycine residues
notwithstanding), rather we suggest that the observed
amino acid frequencies at x1, x2 and x3 more likely are the
result of selective pressure arising from helical structural
constraints imposed by the GxxxG motif and its possible
structural role in FliI ATPase regulation. Hence we suggest

that the high frequencies of certain amino acids at positions x1, x2 and x3 are simply the result of convergent evolution.
Although the amino acid compositions in each positionrepeat-type combination show distinct biases, there are
also overriding similarities. The analysis below is specific
to FliH, but similar biases are seen with YscL. For instance,
in the x1 position of AxxxG repeats, Arg is found at a much
higher frequency (20%) than it is in x1 of GxxxG (10%)
(Figures 5, 7 and 8). Tyr or Phe account for more than
30% of the residues found in position x1 of AxxxG but are
never found in positions x2 or x3 of AxxxG or very rarely for
x2 or x3 of GxxxG. More apparent still is the bias in position x3 toward Glu, which accounts for more than a third
of the residues found in that position.
In GxxxG repeats, Tyr and Phe account for over 45% of the
x1 positions, Leu with 15% compared to zero in AxxxG,
and then Arg and Lys together making up approximately
15%. Glu, Gln, and Ala together account for about 2/3 of
the residues in position x3. Of note is that Gln makes up
over 15% of the residues in the x3 position of GxxxGs,
while the similar amino acid Asn, differing from Gln only
by virtue of having one fewer methylene group in its side
chain, is rarely found in that position.
It is also interesting to examine how the amino acid distribution differs in each of the three repeat types. In general,
the amino acid distribution in each repeat position is
fairly similar, with a general preference for Ala, Glu, Gln,
Arg, Lys, and Tyr. However, there are some obvious differences: AxxxGs and GxxxGs have a very high frequency of
Tyr or Phe in position x1, whereas these are comparatively
rare in GxxxAs. Ala is quite common in position x3 of
GxxxGs, but is less common in GxxxAs and rare in AxxxGs.
Arg is quite common in positions x1 and x2 in AxxxGs and
GxxxAs, but is less common in GxxxGs.
More generally, Figures 7 and 8 suggest that, particularly
for GxxxGs, positions x2 and x3 are basically equivalent in
their amino acid preferences, while the amino acid frequencies in position x1 are significantly different than that
of x2 and x3. This observation suggests that position x1 has
a fundamentally different structural role than either positions x2 or x3; one possibility is that the amino acid in
position x1 facilitates helix-helix interactions, while the
amino acids in x2 and x3 are involved in maintaining helical stability.
In addition, the frequencies obtained using these FliH and
YscL datasets are very similar to those obtained when
using sets of sequences where the maximum pairwise
identity is 90%, rather than 25%. The frequency distribution for the 25% identity sets depicted in Figures 7 and 8

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/72

is also provided for the 90% identity sequence sets in
Additional file 4. This observation is consistent with the
hypothesis that positions x1-x3 in the GxxxG repeats have
undergone extensive mutation during the course of evolution, but have reached an equilibrium amino acid composition that is consistent with the structural and functional
constraints placed on these motifs. That multiple combinations of a few amino acid types are observed, and not a
distinct conserved sequence pattern at x1-x3, suggests that
there are multiple permutations of amino acid residues
that equally fulfil the structural/functional requirements
of these repeats in FliH protein and its role in the flagellar
export apparatus.
Finding correlations between pairs of amino acids in
specific positions in the primary repeat segments
We sought to find pairs of amino acids in specific positions that occur together significantly more often than
would be predicted by chance. This analysis was performed only for FliH; due to their short primary repeat
segments, the same analysis would not be meaningful for
YscL proteins. The pair correlation, a value that is greater
than one if a particular pair of amino acids in a given pair
of positions occurs more often than would be expected by
chance, was calculated for each possible pair of amino
acids, and in each possible pair of positions, within the
primary repeat segments. The statistical significance for
each correlation was computed using a χ2 test.

As stated earlier, we hypothesized that certain pairs of
amino acids in nearby positions (in the same repeat, or in
adjacent repeats) would be significantly correlated, while
there would be very few significant correlations, if any,
when the positions were farther apart. Table 1 shows the
most significant correlations found.
As expected, most of the significant patterns found in
Table 1 involve residues that are nearby in the primary
sequence, although there is an important exception. The
most significant correlation is GxAxGxxxGxAxG, which is
surprising given that it is a longer-range pattern. It is possible that the Ala residues in the x2 positions contribute to
helical stability via hydrophobic interactions or by some
other mechanism. Some correlations are readily explicable; for instance, the pattern GQxxGYxxG seems plausible,
as the NE2 amide hydrogen of the Gln residue at x1 should
be able to either donate a hydrogen bond to the Tyr residue OH or provide its N-H group to make an amino-aromatic interaction. Furthermore, the NE2 amide hydrogen
of a Gln residue in position x1 can also donate a hydrogen
bond to the backbone carbonyl oxygen of the first Gly residue in the neighbouring twofold related GxxxG helix segment presuming standard GxxxG helix dimerization [26].
However, other patterns are more difficult to explain. For
instance, the pattern GYxxGFxxG is found twice as often as

would be expected by chance, but the Phe and Tyr side
chains are unlikely to interact directly with each other, as
both side chains would presumably be in a χ1 = 180° conformation favoured by aromatic residues in helices, preventing van der Waals stacking of the aromatic rings. The
strong positive correlation may indicate that the combination of these two residues in these positions is conducive
to forming helix-helix interactions through close contacts
of the aromatic side chain on one helix with the glycine
backbone atoms on the adjacent helix, again assuming
standard GxxxG helix dimerization.
Identifying glycine repeats in the helices of other proteins
A set of 7,963 proteins were downloaded from the PDB,
and the helices from each protein were examined to determine the presence and length of any glycine repeats.
Because GxxxG is the dominant motif in FliH proteins,
these helices were examined only for GxxxGs; AxxxGs and
GxxxAs were ignored. This analysis is similar to that performed by Kleiger et al. [26], who examined another nonredundant PDB set and found that 1.26% of the helices
that they examined contained the GxxxG motif. In the
present analysis, a total of 85,770 unique helices were
examined, and the frequencies of different lengths of glycine repeats are shown in Table 2.

The most obvious conclusion that can be drawn from the
data in Table 2 is that the long primary repeat segments
found in some of the FliH proteins are – at least as far as
this dataset is concerned – absolutely unique, which is
quite surprising given how nature has a tendency to reuse
the same constructs. Information regarding the seven helices that contained a GxxxGxxxGxxxG repeat is provided
in Table 3. The amino acids in the variable positions of
these repeats are predominantly hydrophobic, and it is
obvious that none of these repeat segments are similar to
those found in FliH.
The structure of glycine repeat-containing helices in other
proteins as a model for FliH
Although no crystal structure has been solved for any FliH
protein, one can still obtain insight into the structure of
the FliH glycine repeats by examining the crystal structures of other proteins that also have glycine repeats.

Unfortunately, there are no solved structures of proteins
having long glycine repeats. The best alternative would be
to use one of the proteins given in Table 3, but unfortunately the amino acid composition of the glycine repeats
in these helices is so unlike that of the FliH proteins that
none would make a good model for the type of interaction that might be formed between helices in FliH.
Thus, the remaining approach is to find a protein that
contains a single GxxxG repeat having FliH-like amino
acids in the variable positions. In their analysis of helical
interaction motifs in proteins, Kleiger et al. [26] provide a
table of proteins that contain GxxxG repeats that mediate
helix-helix interactions. The glycine repeat in each PDB
file given by Kleiger and co-authors was identified, and it
was found that some of these contained amino acids in
the variable positions that were similar to the amino acids
that are commonly found in the glycine repeats in FliH.
We chose E. coli site-specific recombinase (PDB ID 1HJR)
as a model for helix-helix dimerization in FliH. This protein contains the glycine repeat GQARG, which – while
not the archetypical FliH repeat – contains residues in x1,
x2, and x3 that are represented in at least moderate
amounts in the same position in FliH repeats. There are
proteins given by Kleiger et al. that contain repeats with
variable amino acids more closely matching those usually
found in FliH (1DBT contains the repeat GLEEG, for
instance). However, 1HJR was chosen because it features
two identical glycine repeat segments (from identical subunits) that dimerize, whereas the helix containing the glycine repeat in 1DBT dimerizes with a helix that does not
contain a GxxxG. Given that two FliH proteins dimerize to
form a heterotrimeric complex with FliI [17], and that
many FliH proteins contain several repeats throughout
the protein, it seems likely that, in FliH, dimerization
would occur between two helices that both contain glycine repeats, making 1HJR a better model than 1DBT. See
Figure 9 for a molecular model of the GxxxG helix-helix
dimer in this protein.
Parts (C) and (D) of Figure 9 suggest that interactions
between adjacent glycine residues may have an important
role in the dimerization process, as the lack of a bulky side
chain in this residue allows a C-H... O hydrogen bond to
form between the two Gly residues. In addition, the closest contacts between residues with side chains appear to
be between the x1 position in the first helix and the x2
position of the second twofold symmetry-related helix. In
the case of 1HJR, the NE of the Arg residue in position x1
donates a hydrogen bond to the OE1 oxygen atom of the
Gln residue in x2 on the opposite helix. Although residues
in positions x2 and x3 can also make interactions with the
adjacent twofold symmetry-related helix, they do not
appear to be as close together in space.

Discussion
Functional significance of the variability in length of
glycine repeats in different FliH proteins
Given the large amount of variability in the lengths of the
glycine repeat segments in different FliH proteins, it begs
the question as to whether helix-helix dimerization or
some other property inherent to the GxxxG sequences is
functionally important in FliH. If so, it would imply that
one of two things is true: either the FliH proteins with few
or no glycine repeats are able to form helix-helix dimers
anyway, perhaps due to the presence of some other motif,
or that these FliH proteins assume some other structure
that happens to be functionally equivalent to the helixhelix dimers that are presumably found in the GxxxG
repeat-rich FliH proteins. It seems possible that this distinction could be the result of FliH genes ancestrally
acquiring a GxxxG segment that has over time undergone
convergent evolution, with two or more ancestral proteins
evolving semi-independently into a functionally similar
end product – some evolving into the glycine repeat-rich
FliH proteins, and others evolving into FliH proteins lacking these repeats. The extremely low sequence identity
between many FliH proteins would also support this
hypothesis. This also raises the question of how such
repeats might evolve. Comparison of closely related FliH
GxxxG sequence repeats from BLAST searches (results not
shown) suggests that additional repeats are likely added
one at a time in four residue steps. How this might occur
during DNA replication or recombination is not known.
The evolution of multiple short sequence motifs,
although a challenging problem, is outside the scope of
this analysis, but is certain to attract the attention of other
researchers in the future.
Comparison of glycine repeat frequencies with
quantitative α-helix propensities
It is interesting to compare the amino acid frequencies
given in Figures 7 and 8 with the experimentally-derived
propensity of each amino acid to be in an α-helix. The
scale derived by Pace and Scholtz [27] assigns a number
between 0 and 1 kcal/mol to each amino acid, with higher
energies reflecting decreased helix propensity. According
to their scale, Ala has the highest helix propensity, while
Pro has the lowest. Consistent with this scale, Figures 7
and 8 show that four of the nine position – repeat-type
combinations contain Ala at a relatively high frequency
(over 10%). In contrast, Leu, the second-most favourable
helix-forming residue, is present at high frequencies
(~14%) only in position x1 of GxxxG repeats. Glu and
Gln, which are found at high frequency in the glycine
repeats, have only moderate helix propensity according to
Pace and Scholtz's scale (lower than Leu, Met, and Lys, all
of which are found at much lower frequencies in the primary repeat segments than either Glu or Gln).

while (C) and (D) were produced using TURBO-FRODO [33].

It is possible that the amino acid composition required for
helix-helix dimerization is distinctly different than that
found in a typical α-helix. For instance, we have argued
above that the hydrogen bonding capability of side chains
(e.g. Glu, Gln, Arg) in positions x1 and x2 may be very
important in side chain-side chain or side chain-backbone
interactions in dimeric GxxxG helix-helix interactions.
Further work would involve careful structural and biochemical characterization of various idealized GxxxG
motifs in peptides and proteins.
It is important to acknowledge that many different scales
have been developed for measuring the α-helix propensity
of the amino acids, and although they are mostly consist-

ent with one another, each scale is derived from a unique
set of experimental parameters. In this case, we have chosen to compare our results with Pace and Scholtz's scale,
but other scales are qualitatively very similar, with Ala,
Glu, Met, Leu, Phe, Lys and Gln generally acknowledged
as being helix forming residues. For instance, one secondary structure propensity scale that is commonly found in
biochemistry textbooks lists Glu as the most favorable
helix residue, which is more consistent with the composition of the glycine repeats in FliH. However, this same
scale also lists Tyr as being somewhat unfavourable in helices, whereas in FliH Tyr is strongly favoured in position
x1 of AxxxG and GxxxG motifs. This underscores the often
stated caveat that context is everything in protein struc-

BMC Microbiology 2009, 9:72

ture. The presence of glycine in such helical segments reinforces this point, as glycine residues are not normally
acknowledged as being helix formers except within certain
local sequence contexts.
Looking beyond the PDB to find proteins with glycine
repeats
We report that there are no sequences found in the PDB
set that we downloaded containing helices with glycine
repeats anywhere near the length of those found in some
FliH proteins. As a relatively small fraction of all known
protein sequences have had their structures solved, one
would have a better chance of finding long glycine repeats
by searching a larger database of protein sequences (not
structures), such as the Swiss-Prot database. Some preliminary analysis was performed as a starting point for
addressing this problem. The entire Swiss-Prot database,
which consisted of 261,515 sequences at the time that it
was downloaded, was searched for FliH-like glycine repeat
segments. Of course, since these sequences do not contain
secondary structure information, there was no way to
limit the search to α-helices. Eighteen sequences were
found that contained repeat segments of length 11 or
longer; however, all of these segments consisted of lowcomplexity repeats (for instance, the protein with SwissProt accession number P19260 contains the repeat
GSAGGSAGGSAGGSAGGSAGGSAGGSAGGSAGGSAGGS
AGGSAGGSAGG), and thus were in no way analogous to
repeats in FliH. The longest glycine repeat segment that
was not a low-complexity repeat was of length 10, which
was found in a presumably uncharacterized protein from
Rickettsia japonica simply called "17 kDa surface antigen"
(Swiss-Prot accession number Q52764). Further analysis
would have to be done with this Swiss-Prot-derived
sequence information in order to identify repeat segments
that are similar to those found in FliH.

Conclusion
While many different short protein sequence motifs have
been characterized, the glycine repeats in FliH and YscL
are an unusual example. Firstly there is an obvious structural hypothesis to put the general features of the
sequence motif in context and amino acid secondary
structure preferences for residues found in the repeats
strongly suggest an α-helical structure. However, not all
observed pairwise residue correlations in adjacent repeats
are entirely well-explained within the context of the presented structural model. In addition we have no plausible
explanation for why only FliH proteins, and no other
sequences, contain these unique GxxxG repeats. There is
also no obvious reason or explanation for the highly variable number of repeats in different FliH sequences. However, sequence deletions in Salmonella FliH that affect in
vitro ATPase hydrolysis assays for a FliI:FliH complex
(either by enhancing or reducing FliI's ATPase activity)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/72

overlap with one or more of the Salmonella FliH GxxxG
repeats (see introduction) [17]. This suggests that secondary interactions between FliI and FliH, in addition to the
well-known interaction between the C-domain of FliH
and the N-terminal 15 residues of FliI, may depend critically on the presence of the GxxxG motif [15,18]. Studies
on the ATPase activities and/or export capability of
FliI:FliH pairs from other motile bacteria with engineered
deletions in the FliH GxxxG repeats would likely shed
light on the importance of the GxxxG repeats in flagellar
protein export. While the extremely long length of the
repeats in some FliH proteins implies that the repeats may
cooperate to perform an important functional or structural role, the fact that other FliH sequences have short
repeats segments, or even no repeat segment at all, would
suggest otherwise. Alternately, another unidentified protein involved in the flagellum export pathway may be able
to compensate for deletion of the GxxxG motifs in FliH.
Given the likely structural constraints on FliH participating in the flagellar export pathway via interactions with
FliI, FliN and other proteins at the base of the flagellar
export pore, it will be interesting to see if more than one
protein participates in interactions with the FliH GxxxG
motifs. It is also interesting that extremely long glycine
repeats evolved in FliH, but not in its Type III secretion
homologue YscL, and this may actually tell us something,
albeit cryptically, about differences in the two export systems. The extremely biased amino acid composition of
the glycine repeats suggests that these regions may adopt
nonstandard helix-helix tertiary or quaternary interactions that will be of interest for structural biologists to elucidate. Lastly, and perhaps most interestingly, the extreme
rarity of this motif in other proteins is very surprising
given that nature tends to find similar structural solutions
to a biological problem multiple times. Crystal structures
and careful biochemical/biological analysis of these proteins should ultimately be able to address these fascinating issues.

Methods
Acquiring the set of FliH proteins
We endeavored to acquire FliH proteins from as many different bacterial species as possible. To accomplish this,
GenBank was searched for protein sequences whose
annotation contained the word "FliH", and these protein
sequences were downloaded. In addition, the FliH
sequence from Salmonella and the FliH sequence was H.
pylori were used as input to PSI-BLAST, and the sequences
attaining e-values of less than 10-3 after two iterations
were downloaded. All of these sequences were aggregated
into a single set that will be denoted "set A".
Filtering of FliH sequences
Redundancy in set A was reduced by using the EMBOSS
[28] program needle to perform pairwise global align-

Page 16 of 20
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Microbiology 2009, 9:72

ments [29] between all possible pairs of sequences. That
is, each sequence in set A was globally aligned with every
other sequence, and the % identity between each pair of
sequences was recorded. The gap opening penalty used in
needle was 8, while the gap extension penalty was set to
0.5; all other settings were left at their default values.
Using the % identity data for each pair in set A, a new set
of proteins ("set B") was derived such that no protein in
the latter set was more than 25% identical to any other
protein in that same set. The purpose of this was to eliminate as much as possible the phylogenetic signal, which
could potentially confound the statistical results. This set
was used to derive the data shown in Figures 4, 5, 7 and 8.
For comparison purposes, a larger set of proteins was created; in this set, no protein was more than 90% identical
to any other protein. Analysis of this set is shown in Additional files 3 and 4.
Note that the obvious method for deriving set B is simply
to randomly delete one of the proteins whenever two proteins in set A are found to be more than 25% identical.
However, this method may result in more proteins being
deleted than necessary; consider three proteins X, Y, and
Z, and that proteins X and Y are both more than 25%
identical to protein Z, but are not more than 25% identical to each other (casual testing suggested that this does
happen occasionally). Suppose that X is first compared to
Z and found to be more than 25% identical, and X is arbitrarily chosen for deletion. Then Y is compared to Z, and
one of these proteins is deleted. Now only one protein is
left, despite the fact that only Z needed to be deleted in
order to satisfy the requirements of set B. To solve this
problem and maximize the number of sequences left after
filtering, the following algorithm was used: for each protein p in set A, a set ψp is maintained that contains all the
other proteins that are more than 25% identical to p. The
sequence M with the highest value of |ψM| is found, and
M is then removed from set A; in addition, M is also
deleted from every other protein's ψp. This process is
repeated until ψp = ∅ for all p.
To remove proteins that were unlikely to actually be FliH,
the mean length μ of the sequences in set B was computed, as well as the standard deviation σ of these lengths.
Protein sequences having a length outside the range μ ±
1.5σ were deleted. Finally, a multiple alignment of the
sequences was created using T-coffee [30], and sequences
were deleted that, based on the alignment, looked as if
they were unlikely to actually be FliH.
Acquiring and filtering the YscL sequences
The procedure used to acquire YscL sequences was similar
to that used to acquire the FliH sequences. The only difference was that, due to their inconsistent naming conventions, a GenBank search was not performed; rather, the set

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/72

consisted only of significant matches from a PSIBLAST
search using the YscL sequence from Yersinia enterocolitica.
The sequences were then filtered in the same manner as
the FliH sequences.
Characterization of amino acid frequencies in the primary
repeat segments
A Perl script was written to determine, for each repeat
type, the frequency by which each amino acid is found in
positions x1, x2 and x3. Only repeats in the primary repeat
segments were analyzed; repeats in secondary repeat segments were ignored. To ascertain whether the amino acid
distribution in each position–repeat-type combination
was significantly different than the overall amino acid
composition of FliH proteins, the mean frequency of each
amino acid in the FliH proteins was computed, and this
was compared (separately) to each of the amino acid distributions described above by using a χ2 test. Let EikR
denote the number of times that amino acid i would be
expected to be found in position xk of repeat type R given
the overall frequency of i in the entirety of the FliH proteins. That is, EikR is equal to the fraction of residues in the
FliH proteins that are amino acid i, multiplied by the total
number of repeats of type R. If OikR denotes the observed
count, then under the null hypothesis (EikR = OikR for each
amino acid i),
2
χ kR =

∑
i

(OikR − E ikR ) 2
E ikR

is distributed as χ2 with 19 degrees of freedom. The Pvalue corresponding to each χkR2 was determined using
the Statistics::Distributions Perl module.
Determining correlations between pairs of amino acids in
the primary repeat segments
To determine whether certain pairs of amino acids occur
together in certain positions at frequencies significantly
greater than would be expected by chance, correlations for
all possible pairs of amino acids were calculated for each
possible pair of positions within a given primary repeat
segment. Correlations were determined only in GxxxG
repeats (AxxxGs and GxxxAs were ignored). Statistical
analysis was performed as described previously [31,32].
Consider a typical segment in a FliH protein with m
GxxxG repeats. Define nijkld to be the number of times that
amino acid i is found at position xk in some arbitrary
repeat r (1 ≤ r ≤ m), and amino acid j is found at position
xl in the (r + d)th repeat (1 ≤ r + d ≤ m). Thus, the possible
values for i and j are the 20 amino acids, and k and l can
each be either 1, 2, or 3. Values for d range from 0 to 9; the
upper value was chosen because the longest repeat found
in any FliH protein in set B was of length 10. If d = 0, then
this means that the two amino acids in the pair are in the
same repeat; if d = 1, it means that they are in adjacent

Page 17 of 20
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Microbiology 2009, 9:72

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/72

repeats, and so on. When d = 0, k <l. To compute nijkld, the
following procedure was used:
For each FliH sequence p
For each GxxxG repeat r in p with r + d ≤ m
If position xk in repeat r contains residue i and
position xl in repeat (r + d) contains residue j
Add 1 to nijkld
The expected value of nijkld, assuming that no correlation
exists, is

E ijkld =

n ikd n jld
nd

where n ikd = ∑ j n ijkld is the number of times amino acid
i is found at position xk (with any amino acid at position
xl), n jld = ∑ i n ijkld is the analogous value for the other
amino acid, and n d = ∑ i , j n ijkld is the total number of
pairs. Note that superfluous subscripts are dropped in the
preceding notation.
Finally, let

g ijkld =

n ijkld
E ijkld

denote the pair correlation, which will be greater than one
if the amino acids at the indicated positions are found at
a greater frequency than would be expected given their
individual frequencies in those positions, and vice versa.
The significance of each correlation was computed using a
χ2 test:

2
χ ijkld =

(n ijkld − E ijkld ) 2
E ijkld

If the null hypothesis is true (nijkld = Eijkld), then χ2ijkld will
have a χ2 distribution with one degree of freedom.
The following is an example to illustrate the above procedure. Assume that we want to find the pair correlation
between Asp in position x3 and Glu in position x1 in pairs
of repeats that have one repeat between them. This corresponds to the pattern GxxDGxxxGExxG, and therefore i =
D, j = E, k = 3, l = 1, and d = 2. Also assume that the

number of possible instances in which these amino acids
could occur together in the stated pattern, in all the FliH
proteins, is 263 (nd = 263). Of these instances, Asp is
found in position x3 of the left-hand repeat 22 times,
while a Glu occurs in position x1 of the right-hand repeat
9 times (nikd = 22 and njld = 9). Thus, the number of times
you would expect Asp and Glu to appear together in these
positions, assuming no correlation, is Eijkld = (22 × 9)/263
= 0.753. The actual number of times that they occur
together is nijkld = 5; the pair correlation is thus gijkld = 5/
0.753 = 6.64, meaning that this pairing of amino acids in
the stated positions is found 6.64 times as often as would
be expected at random. The χ2 value is (5 - 0.753)2/0.753
= 23.95, which corresponds to a P-value of 9.8 × 10-7,
meaning that this correlation is certainly statistically significant.
Identifying glycine repeats in proteins in the Protein Data
Bank
7,963 proteins were downloaded from the PDB by first
searching for molecules that contain protein, then removing structures solved by a method other than X-ray crystallography, and finally using the "remove similar sequences
at 40% identity" option.

Each PDB file was searched using a Perl script for helices
that contain glycine repeats. If multiple helices had the
exact same sequence, then all but one of these were discarded. This occurred both in the same protein (when
there are multiple identical subunits), and between proteins (despite the sequences being less than 40% identical
according to the PDB's criteria, some PDB files still contained helices with sequences that were the same as helices found in another PDB file).
Protein visualization
TURBO-FRODO [33] and PyMol [34] were both used as
protein visualization tools.
Secondary structure prediction
The tools in references [35-39] were used for secondary
structure predictions of the GxxxG repeats and those
shown in Figures 1, 2 and 3.

Authors' contributions
BT devised and implemented the database extraction procedures and the statistical tests. SM identified the FliH
repeats and preliminary statistical preferences for positions x1 to x3. Both authors contributed to the writing of
the manuscript and in preparation of figures. Both
authors read and approved the final manuscript.
