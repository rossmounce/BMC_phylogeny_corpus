Abstract
Background: The proneural proteins Mash1 and Ngn2 are key cell autonomous regulators of
neurogenesis in the mammalian central nervous system, yet little is known about the molecular
pathways regulated by these transcription factors.
Results: Here we identify the downstream effectors of proneural genes in the telencephalon using
a genomic approach to analyze the transcriptome of mice that are either lacking or overexpressing
proneural genes. Novel targets of Ngn2 and/or Mash1 were identified, such as members of the
Notch and Wnt pathways, and proteins involved in adhesion and signal transduction. Next, we
searched the non-coding sequence surrounding the predicted proneural downstream effector
genes for evolutionarily conserved transcription factor binding sites associated with newly defined
consensus binding sites for Ngn2 and Mash1. This allowed us to identify potential novel co-factors
and co-regulators for proneural proteins, including Creb, Tcf/Lef, Pou-domain containing
transcription factors, Sox9, and Mef2a. Finally, a gene regulatory network was delineated using a
novel Bayesian-based algorithm that can incorporate information from diverse datasets.
Conclusion: Together, these data shed light on the molecular pathways regulated by proneural
genes and demonstrate that the integration of experimentation with bioinformatics can guide both
hypothesis testing and hypothesis generation.

Background
During development of the mammalian nervous system,
neural progenitors within the neuroepithelium give rise

sequentially to neuronal cells and glia. To achieve these
well-orchestrated waves of differentiation, neuroepithelial progenitors are progressively constrained via specific

extrinsic and intrinsic signals. By directly promoting the
neuronal fate in neural progenitors, the proneural transcription factors of the bHLH family are essential regulators of neurogenesis from invertebrates to mammals [1].
Three proneural genes have been characterized to date in
the embryonic mouse telencephalon: Neurogenin1 and
Neurogenin2 are expressed in neuronal progenitors in dorsal telencephalon [2], which gives rise to the cerebral cortex, while Mash1 determines the fate of neuronal
progenitors in the ventral telencephalon [3], giving rise to
the basal ganglia. In addition to their role in the selection
of neuronal progenitors within the neuroepithelium, vertebrate proneural genes have also been shown to specify
neuronal subtype identities. Indeed, Ngn2 is necessary for
the proper differentiation of excitatory glutamatergic projection neurons in the cerebral cortex, while Mash1 promotes the fate of GABA-ergic inhibitory interneurons in
the basal ganglia [4]. Proneural transcription factors are
thus critical regulators for both the initiation of neuronal
differentiation and the specification of neurons into distinct regional subtypes.
In order to understand how Ngn2 and Mash1 regulate
these two different aspects of neurogenesis we have developed a genomic approach incorporating the generation of
microarray datasets of mice either lacking or overexpressing proneural genes, phylogenetic footprinting, and analysis using Bayesian statistical regression. The utility of
Bayesian-based network analyses to determine predictive
gene regulatory network structures has been demonstrated in in vitro and invertebrate models [5-7], but few
attempts have been made using datasets derived from
mammalian species due to the dependence of these techniques on a relatively large sample size [8]. However, this
limitation may be eased through incorporation of data
from other sources, such as prior information from the literature and sequence-based transcription factor binding
site (TFBS) information [9].
Here, we initially identify a gene regulatory network
(GRN) from a compilation of the current literature on
proneural bHLH protein regulation of telencephalic
development during neurogenesis. Next, microarray data
from gain-of-function (GOF) analysis obtained after electroporation of either Ngn2 or Mash1 in the developing
mouse dorsal or ventral telencephalon, respectively, were
fused with previous and new microarray results from
proneural loss-of-function (LOF) experiments [4]. This
allowed us to identify novel targets of Ngn2 and Mash1,
and to formally test literature-based GRN hypotheses
through Bayesian statistical analysis of global gene expression patterns. A total of nine predicted proneural targets
were confirmed by in situ RNA hybridization on brain
slices from embryos lacking or overexpressing Mash1 or
Ngn2, including several members of Notch signaling path-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/15

way (Dll1, Hes5 and Mfng) as well as the RNA binding
protein Elavl4 (HuC/D). Members of the Wnt signaling
pathway are predicted as targets of Ngn2 in the cerebral
cortex. We then took advantage of the identification of
putative downstream effectors of proneural genes to identify conserved binding sites for Mash1 and Ngn2, then
scanned the sequence surrounding them for other conserved TFBSs. From this analysis, we predict Creb, Tcf/Lef,
Pou-domain containing transcription factors, Sox9, and
Mef2a as novel co-factors (binding at a short distance)
and co-regulators (binding at further distance) of proneural proteins. Finally, a novel Bayesian-based algorithm
was developed to compile the microarray data, the TFBS
analysis, and the literature-based network, generating a
proneural GRN for the developing mouse telencephalon.

Results
Literature-based network structure
A GRN that describes the current understanding of proneural bHLH interactions in the developing telencephalon
was developed through a review of the literature (Figure
1). The reader is referred Additional file 1 and several
important reviews[1,10,11] for more detailed descriptions of the experimental research underlying this literature-based GRN.
GOF experiments
To further identify genes regulated by the proneural factors Ngn2 and Mash1 in the embryonic telencephalon
and complement existing LOF data [4], we developed a
GOF approach using electroporation in a whole embryo
culture. The feasibility of the GOF study was tested by
injection of a Ngn2-expressing or Mash1-expressing vector
in the telencephalic vesicles of E10.5 mouse embryos. The
time course of Ngn2 and Mash1 overexpression was followed with Dll1 promoter-lacZ reporter transgenes monitoring Ngn2 and Mash1 activities, respectively (Figure
2(a); see also [12]). LacZ reporter activity was detected 10
h after electroporation of Ngn2 or Mash1 in the dorsal and
ventral sides of telencephalic vesicles, respectively, and
reached the highest level 18 h after proneural gene electroporation (Figure 2(a)). In contrast, activation by endogenous proneural proteins of the two reporters in embryos
electroporated with an empty expression vector remained
low. The efficiency of electroporation was similar in the
control and Ngn2- and Mash1-electroporated cortices, as
assessed by expression of a co-electroporated GFP plasmid
before LacZ staining (Additional File 2 and data not
shown). Large-scale electroporation experiments of Ngn2
in the dorsal telencephalon and Mash1 in the ventral telencephalon of E10.5 embryos were thus performed and,
18 h later, the electroporated tissue was processed for RNA
probe preparation (see Methods).

Literature-based gene regulatory network describing proneural bHLH regulation of telencephalon neurogenesis. Activations are identified with an arrow and repressions are identified with a barred line. Those connections that are significant based on the current microarray dataset are shown in red. Significant relationships were determined through analysis of
the distribution of the strength of linkage parameter (β) after 500,000 MCMC simulations (Additional file 6). If more than 95%
of the simulations have values above zero they are considered significant. A * denotes connections that were significant, but as
inhibition.

Identification of candidate Ngn2 and Mash1 target genes
We reasoned that by comparing the transcriptome of
embryos overexpressing proneural genes with expression
data obtained from current Mash1 LOF datasets and previously published Ngn2 LOF datasets [4], we would identify novel downstream effectors of Mash1 and/or Ngn2 in
the developing telencephalon. For the study of Ngn2 targets, data from the cortex of Mash1-/-;Ngn2-/- double
mutant mice was utilized rather than Ngn2-/- single
mutants in order to avoid the compensation due to derepression of Mash1 in the cortex of the later mutants [2].
Analysis of microarray data allowed us to split potential
proneural targets into three groups (Figure 2(b) and 2(c)):

(i) genes regulated by both Mash1 and Ngn2; (ii) genes
regulated by Mash1 only; and (iii) genes regulated by
Ngn2 only. A full list of predicted targets categorized by
Gene Ontology (GO) is presented in Additional file 3.
Briefly, among the 10 common targets were 3 genes
involved in Notch signaling (Dll1, Hes5, and Mfng) and
the RNA binding protein Elavl4 expressed in maturing
neurons [13]. Specific targets of Ngn2 include genes
involved in signal transduction (42 genes), transcription
factors (18 genes) such as the cortical differentiation factors Nhlh1 and Bhlhb5 [14], proteins with kinase/phosphatase activity (12 genes) such as the serine/threonine

Figure 2
Mash1 and Ngn2 GOF experiment
Mash1 and Ngn2 GOF experiment. (a) Mouse embryos at 10.5 days of development were electroporated in the telencephalic vesicle with Mash1 or
Ngn2 expression vectors together with LacZ reporter constructs specific for either Ngn2 (0.27 kb DeltaN LacZ) or Mash1 (0.16 kb DeltaM LacZ) [12,79].
The two regulatory sequences used in these reporter transgenes are located within the 0.8 kb distal promoter region of the Dll1 gene [79]. Embryos were
orientated during the electroporation to target the cortex (Ngn2 vector and 0.27 kb DeltaN LacZ reporter) or the basal ganglia (Mash1 vector and 0.16
kb DeltaM LacZ reporter). Ngn2 and Mash1 overexpression enhances the activity of the LacZ reporter, assessed by β-galactosidase staining, compared
with endogenous proneural proteins (empty expressing vector: Ctrl). Efficiency of electroporation was assessed using a GFP expression vector and was
similar in all electroporated embryos (not shown). (b) Fold changes of selected potential targets of Ngn2, Mash1, or both factors in Ngn2 GOF and Mash1
GOF experiments and in Mash1 mutant and Mash1;Ngn2 double mutant embryos, based on normalized microarray data. A * indicates known direct targets of Mash1 or Ngn2. (c) Putative targets of Mash1 and Ngn2 were identified through fusion of Ngn2 and Mash1 LOF and GOF microarray datasets.
Common targets were identified as transcripts that were decreased in Mash1 LOF and Mash1;Ngn2 LOF experiments and increased in Ngn2 and Mash1
GOF experiments. Mash1 targets are those transcripts that were only decreased in Mash1 LOF and increased in Mash1 GOF. Ngn2 targets are those transcripts that were only decreased in Ngn2/Mash1 LOF and increased in Ngn2 GOF. A cut-off of 1.3-fold was used as described in more detail in Methods. A
full list of predicted targets categorized by GO is available in Additional file 3.

kinase Dcx, already shown to be directly regulated by
Ngn2 in the cortex [15] and other cortical genes such as
the cell adhesion molecule Ephrin A4 [16]. Interestingly,
several components of the Wnt pathway are predicted targets of Ngn2 including Wnt7b [17], DIX domain containing
1 [18], Fzd1, Fzd3, and Tax1bp3. It is noteworthy that NeuroD, a gene considered as directly regulated by Ngn proteins [19], was decreased in the Ngn2-/- embryos, but was
not significantly upregulated after Ngn2 electroporation
in microarray experiments, suggesting that the window for
analysis of electroporated embryos was not suitable.
Indeed, in situ hybridization analysis showed that electroporation of Ngn2 does not induce NeuroD expression in
the telencephalon at 24 h, but only at 48 h after electroporation (Additional file 2). A similar delay has been
reported for induction of NeuroD by the related gene Ngn3
in the intestine [20]. This suggests either that NeuroD is
not a direct target of Ngn2, or that its expression also
requires another factor that is not present at the time of
electroporation. Involvement of other genes in the regulation of NeuroD is supported by the lack of a dramatic
change in NeuroD expression in Ngn2 null mutant telencephalon [21].
Finally, putative targets of Mash1 include transcription
factors (seven genes) such as the LIM homeobox transcription factor Isl1, which is potentially involved in the
specification of GABAergic projection neurons in the striatum [22], and factors involved in signal transduction such
as the GABA vesicular transporter Slc32a1/VIAAT [23] and
the gene GP38/Podoplanin [24], the Notch regulated protein Nrarp shown to destabilize the Notch intracellular
domain (NICD) [25-27], and Lfng, a modulator of Notch
signaling regulated directly by Mash1 in the telencephalon [12]. These putative target genes form the basis
for subsequent bioinformatics and network analyses to
predict novel co-factors, co-regulators, and GRN connectivity.
Validation of predicted target genes
To confirm the microarray data, several of the predicted
novel targets of Ngn2 and Mash1 were validated through
RNA in situ hybridization analysis of wild type and
mutant embryos (Ngn2-/- and Mash1-/-), and of embryos
overexpressing Ngn2 or Mash1 (Figure 3 and Additional
file 4). The predicted Ngn2 targets Nhlh1, Mfng, and Elavl4
are mostly expressed at E13.5 in the mantle zone of the
dorsal telencephalon, while Rbdh4 and zfp238 are also
expressed in the ventricular zone. All five genes are downregulated in the medial part of the dorsal telencephalon of
Ngn2 mutant embryos, indicating that Ngn2 is indeed
required for normal expression of these genes (Figure
3(a)). We also show that Ngn2 can induce expression of
the same predicted targets when overexpressed by electroporation in the telencephalon of E10.5 embryos. At this

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/15

stage, their expression is barely detectable in neurons that
begin to accumulate above the ventricular zone of the dorsal telencephalon (left telencephalic vesicles in Figure
3(a)). Expression of Nhlh1, Mfng, zfp238, Rbdh4, and
Elavl4 is strongly upregulated after electroporation of a
Ngn2-expressing vector in the dorsal telencephalon (right
telencephalic vesicles in Figure 3(a), marked by *). Thus,
both LOF and GOF analysis confirm that five predicted
targets are indeed regulated by Ngn2 in the developing
mouse telencephalon.
The predicted Mash1 targets Mfng and Pdpn are predominantly expressed in the ventricular zone of the ventral telencephalon at E12.5, while Gadd45g is predominantly
expressed in the subventricular zone and Elavl4 in the
mantle zone (Mnfg and Elavl4 are common candidate targets of Mash1 and Ngn2). All four genes are downregulated in the telencephalon of Mash1 mutant embryos
particularly in the medial part of the ventral telencephalon, which is most severely affected in Mash1
mutant embryos [3] (Figure 3(b)). Ectopic expression of
Mash1 in the dorsal telencephalon of E10.5 embryos
strongly induces expression of the four genes (Figure
3(b)). Mash1 also rapidly induces expression of Gadd45g
and Mfng in the embryonal carcinoma cell line P19, as
detected by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR; see Additional file 5). These data
suggest that many of the genes identified by microarray
analysis of Mash1 and Ngn2 GOF and LOF experiments
are indeed regulated by Mash1 and Ngn2.
Bayesian analysis of literature-based GRN
Connectivity in the literature-based network structure was
quantified based on the GOF and LOF microarray gene
expression datasets. This Bayesian-based method removes
the need to rely on fold change cut-offs by examining the
strength of the predicted relationships based on concurrently evaluating variability in gene expression patterns of
several genes of interest across control and perturbation
experiments. Significant connections based on this analysis (the fifth percentile of the posterior density for β is
greater than zero [8]) are highlighted in red in Figure 1.
Our analysis predicts 86% (31/36) of the connections as
significant based on the microarray dataset; however, four
are considered inhibitory interactions instead of activations, suggesting possible feedback loops between Pax6
and Ngn1, between Satb2, Ngn2 and Nhlh1, as well as
between NeuroD and Etv1 (Additional file 6). Specificity
of our method was estimated through the application of
100 randomly generated datasets by permutation of gene
labels using the entire microarray dataset. This analysis
results in an estimated false positive rate of 8.2%, therefore the chances of seeing 31 significant connections out
of 36 is very low (p < 0.001). Two of the connections originating from Ngn2 (to Ngn1 and Dll1) are not considered

significant based on the current analysis. As the algorithm
relies on linear relationships between genes, its inability
to detect these two connections may be a result of the
non-linear variability between Ngn2 and its targets that is
created by the large increase in Ngn2 transcript levels after
electroporation. In addition, the compensatory action of
Mash1 in the dorsal telencephalon of the Ngn2-/- mutants
further complicates the algorithm's ability to detect connectivity to common targets such as Dll1.
Bioinformatics prediction of Ngn2 and Mash1 co-factors
The identification of potential downstream effectors of
Mash1 and Ngn2 allowed us to examine the occurrence of
defined TFBSs in the conserved sequence surrounding
those genes. The E-box recognized by bHLH proteins is a
degenerate 6 bp (base pair) motif (CANNTG). However,
recent evidence suggests that Mash1 and Ngn2 have different preferences for the two central residues and that their
consensus binding sequences extend even outside of the
E-Box motif (see [12,28,29] and FG and DC, unpublished
data). Based on these and other data, we defined different
consensus binding sequences for Mash1 (GCAGSTGK or
CAGSTG) and Ngn2 (CANTWG) (Additional file 7).

To identify potential co-factors for Ngn2 or Mash1, we
employed phylogenetic footprinting and TFBS search
algorithms on a subset of the predicted targets based on
the microarray dataset (Figure 4(a)). First, 58 conserved
(human, mouse, chicken, frog, and fish) putative Ngn2
binding sites surrounding 11 of the predicted Ngn2 target
genes and 56 conserved putative Mash1 binding sites surrounding 14 of the predicted Mash1 target genes and 6 of
the common target genes were identified (see Methods for
further details). Subsequently, we identified TFBS from
the TRANSFAC library co-occurring specifically with the
putative Ngn2 binding sites in Ngn2 targets or with the
putative Mash1 binding sites in Mash1 and Mash1/Ngn2
common target genes using Fisher's exact two-sided test
for significance (Figure 4(b)). No specific co-factors for
Mash1 were identified in this analysis, whereas cAMP
response element (CRE; bound by CRE binding protein
(Creb)), Yy1, and Nkx binding sites were significantly
enriched near Ngn2 binding sites when compared with
the sequence around Mash1 binding sites (Figure 4(b)).
Several of the predicted co-factors have dorsal/ventral
restricted expression patterns in the embryonic telencephalon, consistent with a role in neuronal specification
(Figure 4(c)).
Bioinformatics prediction of Ngn2 and Mash1 coregulators
Next we sought to predict potential co-regulators that may
bind at regulatory modules independent from those that
bind Ngn2 or Mash1. In particular, we were interested in
identifying transcription factors that may confer regula-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/15

tion at modules closer to the TSS (transcription start site).
In order to efficiently search for co-regulators, we identified evolutionary conserved TFBS (between human and
mouse) using the CONFAC algorithm [30] to analyze a
shorter sequence (10,000 bp) in the 5' flanking region of
31 predicted Mash1, Ngn2, and common targets (Additional file 8). To predict putative common co-regulators,
we tested for enrichment of the identified TFBS in Ngn2
target genes and Mash1/common target genes compared
with a set of 250 randomly selected genes using the MannWhitney statistical test. We identified 41 potential Ngn2and Mash1-specific co-regulators by testing for TFBS
enrichment in Ngn2 targets versus Mash1 targets and vice
versa. We identified 14 putative co-regulators from these
analyses after eliminating those transcription factors that
are not expressed in either the dorsal or ventral developing telencephalon based on microarray transcript levels
(Additional file 9). Predicted common co-regulators
include E2f1, Tef, Nfy, Egr1, Hes1, and Pou-domain containing factors. Predicted co-regulators were specifically
enriched in Ngn2 targets when compared with Mash1 and
common targets include Sox9, Creb, Tcf4, Lef1, Mef2a,
and Yy1. No transcription factors were significantly
enriched when Mash1 target genes were compared against
Ngn2 target genes. This approach identified all five of the
predicted Ngn2 co-factors found in the previous analysis,
as well as identifying several transcription factors that may
co-regulate the putative Ngn2 and Mash1 targets at independent regulatory modules including E2f1, Egr1, Hes1,
and Nfy in both Ngn2 and Mash1 targets and Sox9 and
Mef2a in Ngn2 target genes.
Through interrogation of online databases of in situ
hybridization in serial brain sections across development
[31,32], we confirmed the expression of several predicted
co-factors/co-regulators in the developing dorsal and ventral telencephalon (Additional file 10). Interestingly, several of the predicted co-factors/co-regulators, including
Sox9, Crebbp, Creb1, Tcf4, Lef1, Pou6f1, Pou2f1, Pou3f1,
Tef, Hes1, and E2f1, show appreciable expression in the
ventricular zone of dorsal and/or ventral telencephalon,
where proneural bHLH proteins are expressed. Furthermore, direct protein-protein interactions between proneural bHLH proteins and Crebbp, Tcf4, and Mef2a are
reported in the human protein reference database [33].
Bayesian network analysis with an informative prior
structure
To provide an integrated view of the network regulated by
proneural genes, information obtained from the literature, novel expression data, and phylogenetic footprinting
analyses were quantitatively linked through application of
the Bayesian-based TAO-Gen algorithm [34] with the
addition of an informative prior structure (Figure 5, Additional file 11). Nodes represented in the network include

several candidate Mash1 and Ngn2 target genes from the
fusion and sorting of the GOF/LOF microarray datasets, as
well as candidate co-factors and co-regulators from the
phylogenetic footprinting analyses. An informative prior
structure considered all significant literature-based connections as required (diagrammed using thicker lines)
and used the TFBS information from the phylogenetic
footprinting analyses to weight connections in which
TFBS information was found. For example, a conserved
Sox9 TFBS was identified in the sequence surrounding
Lfng, therefore a preference is given to Sox9 being a parent

to Lfng, which results in a slightly higher probability that
a linear relationship between these two genes will be significant in the posterior distribution. We have confirmed
the reliability of the TAO-Gen algorithm as well as the
utility of the informative prior structure through direct
comparisons with results obtained from another Bayesian
network algorithm [35,36], as well as with results
obtained using TAO-Gen without an informative prior
(Additional file 1).

Algorithm-based gene regulatory network structure for dorsal and ventral telencephalon development
Algorithm-based gene regulatory network structure for dorsal and ventral telencephalon development. The
Bayesian-based TAO-Gen algorithm was implemented with an informative prior structure to predict the optimal network
structure based on the LOF and GOF microarray datasets, evolutionarily conserved TFBS data, prior literature-based knowledge, and spatial and time-specific expression patterns. To highlight the key regulators, the nodes representing genes predicted
to be the parent of at least nine other genes are largest in size (Sox9, Mef2a, Elavl4 and Pou6f1), whereas those that are predicted to regulate at least five other genes are medium in size (Ngn2, Centg3, Tef, Tcf4, Wnt7b, Pou2f1, Yy1, Dll1, E2f1, Arx,
and Creb). See Additional file 11 for matrix of connectivity and Methods for a more detailed description of algorithm.

The resulting Bayesian-based network structure predicts
174 linkages (27 of which are significant lit-based connections) between the set of 82 genes. Sox9, Mef2a, Elavl4,
and Pou6f1 are predicted as the most prolific co-regulators of the target genes, with 14, 12, 9, and 12 children,
respectively. Furthermore, our analysis predicts Creb1,
Crebbp, and Yy1 as the most likely candidates for dorsally
expressed Ngn2 co-factors, and supports a synergistic
interaction between Pou-domain containing transcription
factors and bHLH proneural proteins in the regulation of
common target genes, which is consistent with previous
studies [12]. We also identified several transcription factors as candidate co-regulators of Ngn2 target genes,
including Hes1, Egr1, Nfy, Mef2a, Tef, and Sox9, whereas
Pou6f1 is a predicted co-regulator of Mash1 target genes.
Interestingly, these different transcription factors have
been previously implicated in regulatory processes in
other developmental contexts [37-42], consistent with a
potential role in regulating neurogenesis during telencephalon development.

Discussion
As the amount of experimental data grows and becomes
more complex, the power of computational models to
identify mechanisms of biological processes by integrating diverse sets of experimental data is being realized, particularly in organisms where high throughput
perturbation analyses have been developed, including
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Strongylocentrotus purpuratus [43-47]. However, finding and
quantifying mammalian networks has been challenging
due to the data requirements of current methods. In the
present analysis, we have demonstrated the utility of bioinformatics approaches for elucidation of a GRN describing proneural bHLH (Ngn2 and Mash1) transcription
factor regulation of murine telencephalon specification.
To develop a robust GRN, we first measured global gene
expression patterns in GOF and LOF analyses to identify
novel putative target genes for Ngn2 and Mash1, several of
which were validated by in situ hybridization in slice preparations from mutant and electroporated mouse embryos.
Using Bayesian network analysis, we have corroborated
25 literature-based GRN hypotheses by quantifying connections based on the compiled microarray datasets.
As highly conserved long-range enhancers are known to
be particularly important for developmentally regulated
genes [48-50], we utilized phylogenetic footprinting analyses to identify putative long-range enhancers in several
predicted Ngn2 and Mash1 target genes. This approach
suggests that no putative co-factor binding sites are specifically associated with conserved Mash1 binding sites in
both Mash1 and common target genes, consistent with an
instructive and relatively context-independent role for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/15

Mash1 in ventral cell fate determination [51]. In addition,
the analysis identifies several conserved TFBSs in close
proximity to Ngn2 binding sites surrounding the Ngn2
target genes, consistent with previous findings supporting
a more cell context-dependent role for Ngn2 in dorsal telencephalic fate specification [51]. In addition, we hypothesized that important regulatory modules that bind
transcription factors other than Ngn2 and Mash1 may be
present surrounding the identified target genes. Therefore,
our second comparative genomics analysis was designed
to search for conserved TFBS enriched in target genes, but
not necessarily in close proximity to Mash1 or Ngn2 binding sites. Using a novel Bayesian network analysis
approach with an informative prior structure, we were
able to synthesize the knowledge gained from each of the
above experimental and computational approaches to
predict connectivity between the novel target genes, cofactors, and co-regulators.
Our resultant GRN predicts that Creb1 and Crebbp are the
most likely candidates for a dorsally expressed Ngn2 cofactor regulating cortical targets such as Neurod6, Eomes
and NeuroD2. Interestingly, previous analyses have indicated interactions between bHLH transcription factors,
Creb, and the Creb binding protein (CBP/P300 complex)
in the differentiation of several cell types [52,53], as well
as in neurotrophin-mediated expression of vgf [54]. Most
notably, a conserved Neurod6 promoter has recently been
shown to contain both Creb and E-box binding sites and
is activated via cAMP exposure [55]. Yy1 is also a potential
Ngn2 co-factor, yet our microarray data suggest that Yy1
mRNA expression is confined to the ventral telencephalon. This finding suggests an inhibitory role for Yy1
in Ngn2-regulated transcription, which is supported by
evidence showing Yy1 inhibition of both BMP induced
cell differentiation [56] and Notch transcriptional activity
[57].
Our GRN also supports a synergistic interaction between
Pou-domain containing transcription factors and bHLH
proneural proteins in the activation of several target
genes. Interestingly, both Pou6f1 and Mash1 have been
identified as important mediators of oligodendrocyte
development [58,59], and Pou6f1 is thought to synergistically interact with members of the Sox family [60,61].
Moreover, other members of the Pou domain, class 3 family of transcription factors, Brn1 or Brn2, which exhibit
similar affinity with Pou6f1 for certain binding sites
[62,63] have been experimentally shown to co-regulate
several Mash1 targets in the ventral telencephalon [12].
Finally, our analysis predicts connectivity between Sox9,
Fzd1, and Wnt7b, which is consistent with a recent report
suggesting Sox9 regulation through Wnt signaling [64].
Sox9 may serve as an inhibitory factor for several Ngn2

Page 10 of 18

BMC Biology 2008, 6:15

target genes including Gng2, Npdc1, Eomes, Fzd1, and
Coro2b, consistent with the opposing roles of Sox9 and
Ngn2 in the specification of glial fate [35,36]. We also
show that Mef2a, which has been shown previously to
have complex regulatory functions in neuronal differentiation and plasticity [38-40], may co-activate several of the
predicted Ngn2 targets, such as Neurod, Ngn1, Wnt7b,
Mgst3, Gng2, Acpl2, and Dusp14. In addition, our findings
suggest that transcriptional regulators downstream of Wnt
signaling (Tcf4/Lef1) may bind to regulatory modules that
also bind Ngn2, which is consistent with the role of Wnt
signaling in the specification of the dorsal forebrain [6567], and offers a hypothesis in which coordinated Wnt
activation and Ngn2 expression act in concert to transcriptionally activate target genes. Interestingly, a recent report
suggests that Wnt pathway-initiated neural differentiation, but not proliferation, requires specific interactions
between Tcf/β-catenin and Crebbp [68]. Another intriguing aspect of our analysis is the prediction of Elavl4 as an
important regulator of Ngn2 targets, including Bhlhb5,
Robo1, Nhlh1, Coro2b, Sox11, and Dll1, possibly through
stabilization of mRNA [69]. It is of note that two related
mRNA stabilization genes, Elavl2 and Elavl3, are also predicted targets of Ngn2.
Our current research identifies important research steps
for further refinement of the GRN. The cyclic nature of
delayed negative feedback in the Notch pathway is
thought to act as a molecular clock regulating the timing
of several developmental processes [70]. Future production of robust time-series datasets will allow for application of Bayesian methods that are not limited to the
discovery of acyclic networks and linear relationships
[71]. Several recent reports have suggested connectivity
between Notch and Wnt pathways [27,68,72,73]. For
example, one way in which the Notch pathway may regulate Wnt signaling is through Lef protein stabilization by
Nrarp activation [27]. However, because no data currently
exist that would allow quantitative prediction via direct
protein-protein interactions, we are unable to predict this
relationship in the current network analysis. Nonetheless,
our network analyses of transcriptional regulation offers
other hypotheses such as a Tcf/Lef regulation of Lfng and
Mfng, which is consistent with evidence during somitogenesis suggesting a Wnt mediated regulation of Lfng
expression [74].
One important application of the network analysis is the
prediction of the most useful perturbation or chromatin
immunoprecipitation experiments for resolving the overall network structure [75]. This is particularly relevant to
studies in mammalian species, in which perturbation
analyses are much more time and resource intensive. Our
network analysis would suggest Centg3 and Elavl4 are
important candidates for perturbation and subsequent

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/15

global gene expression analysis for further network resolution, as they are both highly connected nodes and little
is known about their function in the developing telencephalon. Interestingly, Centg3 may protect against neurodegeneration in Polyglutamine diseases [76]. The central
role of Elavl4, which regulates through mRNA stabilization [69], highlights the importance of moving beyond cis
regulatory binding to elucidate network relationships.

Conclusion
In this manuscript, we have combined a number of different approaches to identify regulatory relationships that
are important for mammalian telencephalic development, using existing knowledge from the literature, global
gene expression data from GOF and LOF studies, bioinformatics-based sequence analyses, and Bayesian network
algorithms. Systems biology methodologies that take into
account several data sources, such as that presented here,
will aid in more rapid identification and quantification of
gene regulation which is useful for discovering critical
steps in the progression of normal and perturbed human
telencephalon development. Eventually, the linkage of
mammalian genetic perturbation network analysis with
protein interactions and ultimately phenotypic outcome
will become possible, as has been initiated in invertebrate
models. The methods developed and applied in this manuscript are a first step towards this broader goal.

Methods
Electroporation of mouse embryos
Embryos obtained from CBA/CA X C57Bl/10 crosses were
dissected without removing placental membranes at
embryonic day E10.5, and were transferred into Tyrodes
solution [77]. At this stage Mash1 and Ngn2 are already
expressed in the presumptive basal ganglia and cortex,
respectively. The neuroepithelium is thus competent for
proneural activity and GOF studies should allow the
detection of genes regulated by Mash1 or Ngn2. Embryos
were precultured for 2 h into a 'precision incubator' (BTC
Engineering, Milton, Cambridge, UK) at 37°C with 65%
oxygen in 75% v/v Rat serum + 25% v/v Tyrodes solution
and 2 mg/ml of glucose. Both telencephalic vesicles were
injected for microarray experiments and with only one
vesicle for embryos processed for in situ hybridization
using a FemtoJet Microinjector (Eppendorf) with 2 μl of a
solution containing 3 μg/μl Mash1- or Ngn2-pCAGGS
expression vector [78] and 2 μg/μl GFP control vector.
Electroporation was performed in Tyrodes solution in a
CUY520P20 chamber (Nepagene, Japan) using a BTX
Electro Square Porator (Eppendorf), with the following
settings: 70 V, five pulses, 50 ms at 1 s intervals. Electroporated embryos were cultivated in Rat serum supplemented with glucose as above, for the indicated time.
After 18 h, heart-beating embryos were dissected under a
UV binocular microscope and the electroporated (GFP-

expressing) tissue was dissected under the microscope and
homogenized immediately in 300 μl Trizol (Invitrogen).
The choice of the time of collection of the tissue was based
on maximal expression of the Dll1 promoter-lacZ reporter
located in the 0.8 kb distal promoter region described previously [79] (see Figure 2(a)) and on a more detailed analysis by quantitative RT-PCR of the time course of
induction of Dll1 by Mash1 in P19 cells [12]. This work
showed that induction of this direct target of Mash1
becomes detectable 4–7 h after Mash1 expression but
reaches a plateau only after about 15 h. Therefore, this
time of collection maximizes the detection of putative
direct targets; however, it does not rule out the possibility
of detecting indirect targets as well. Total RNA was
extracted following manufacturer recommendations and
resuspended in 12 μl of diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC)treated water (Ambion). Between 3 and 10 electroporated
cortices or basal ganglia were pooled to produce a minimum of 1 μg total RNA. The preparation of probes and
hybridization to MG430 2.0 chips were performed following Affymetrix guidelines.
RNA in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry
Electroporated embryos were washed for 30 min at 4°C in
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) 1×, fixed in PFA 4% for 3
h, washed again in PBS 1× and incubated in 15% sucrose
phosphate buffer 0.12 M (PB), pH 7.2, overnight at 4°C,
incubated in gelatin 7.5%/sucrose 15% PB at 42°C and
frozen in isopentane at -40°C. Wild-type and mutant
embryos (Ngn2-/- and Mash1-/-) at stage E12.5 or E13.5
were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde (PAF) at
4°C, incubated overnight as before. Embryonic sections
were performed at 10 μM using a Microm cryostat. In situ
hybridizations were carried out as described previously
[12], with NBT/BCIP or fluorescent substrate in the case of
Gp38/Podoplanin [80]. Mouse Elavl4 (HUC/D) polyclonal
antibody was used as described previously [12]. All of the
in situ analyses performed are summarized in Additional
file 4. Briefly, eight genes putatively regulated by Ngn2
and eight genes regulated by Mash1 were selected based
on their levels of downregulation and upregulation in the
microarray data, as well as their potential involvement in
neuronal development (Mnfg, Lnfg, Lhx8, HuC/D, Nscl1)
or expression in the developing nervous system (Gp38/
podoplanin, Rhomboid, Nrarp). Two out of eight Ngn2 candidate genes were not detected in situ in the cortex of WT
embryos and were not tested further. Candidates showing
a consistent regulation in Ngn2 or Mash1 LOF mutant
embryos (five out of six expressed genes for Ngn2 and six
out of eight genes for Mash1) were further analyzed by in
situ hybridization on electroporated GOF embryos.
P19 cell transfection and quantitative RT-PCR
P19 embryonal carcinoma cells are pluripotent cells that
specifically differentiate into neurons when induced by

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/15

retinoic acid or when transfected with Mash1, Ngn1, or
NeuroD expressing vectors [81,82]. We seeded 250,000
P19 cells into 21 cm culture dishes in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 5% goat serum and incubated overnight
at 37°C. Cells were transfected in duplicate with 2 μg
Ngn2-, Mash1-, or empty pCAGGS vectors and 0.1 μg GFP
control vector mixed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's recommendations.
Total RNA extraction was performed in 2 ml Trizol (Invitrogen). RNA pellets were resuspended in 50 μl DEPC
treated water (Ambion) and the RNA concentration was
determined by spectrophotometry. A total of 2 μg RNA
was treated with 10 units DNase I (Invitrogen) and reverse
transcribed with Superscript III (Invitrogen). Quantitative
PCR was performed in duplicates with SYBR Green
(Roche) on a Light cycler apparatus (Roche). A cDNA
from hydroxymethylbilane synthase was used as a reference for normalization. Primer sequences are available
from the authors upon request.
Global gene expression analyses
Twenty-eight separate gene expression datasets were used
for the identification and quantification of GRNs for forebrain development using either the U74A and U74B or
MOE430 2.0 Affymetrix microarray platforms. Analyses of
tissues from dorsal and ventral telencephalon from wildtype (n = 14), Ngn1-/-, Ngn2-/-, Mash1-/-, Ngn1-/-; Ngn2-/
-, and Ngn2-/-; Mash1-/- transgenic mice and GOF tissues
from mice in which Ngn2 or Mash1 were electroporated
on E10.5 and killed 18 h later (see above) are included in
this dataset. Analyses of Ngn1, Ngn2, and Mash1 single
and double knockouts were performed with RNA
extracted from tissue dissected from E13.5 mice and
hybridized to U74A and U74B Affymetrix chips. Basal
ganglia from Mash1 KO embryos were dissected and processed for RNA trizol extraction as described previously [4].
Microarray data from cortical tissue have been described
previously [4]. Two replicates of each control and a single
knockout were analyzed, whereas one replicate for each
double knockout and control was sampled. Microarray
analyses of dorsal and ventral telencephalic tissues from
control and GOF mice (E10.5 mice cultured for 18 h)
were performed using the Affymetrix MOE430 2.0 chip.
Replicates were performed for a total of two dorsal telencephalon controls, three ventral telencephalon controls,
and three each of the Ngn2 and Mash1 GOF mice. Normalization was performed using GC-RMA software for
background adjustment using sequence information [83]
downloaded from [84]. MOE and U74 probesets were
assigned Ensembl IDs based on Ensembl Version 37 and
duplicate Ensembl IDs were collapsed within a set by taking the median value. Gene expression ratios used for the
subsequent network analyses described below were
derived from individual mutant arrays versus a timematched wild-type control gene expression array. To gen-

erate a list of putative target genes we used a 1.3-fold cutoff. We note that the use of a fold change cut-off has been
shown to be more reliable than p-value or false discovery
rate (FDR) cut-offs, in a multicenter large-scale quality
control analysis across laboratories and platforms [85].
Furthermore, our target gene lists are generated from two
independent fold change cut-offs, from both transgenic
and GOF experiments, thereby increasing confidence in
the resultant target gene lists. GOF experiments were performed at an earlier stage in neurogenesis (E10.5 and cultured for 18 h) than LOF experiments (E13.5) so that
expression of Mash1 and Ngn2 in the telencephalon is still
low and the effect of overexpressing these genes is maximal, while the LOF analysis had been performed at a stage
when Mash1 and Ngn2 expression is high, to maximize
the effect of loss of these genes. Based on previous analysis
of Mash1 and Ngn2 function in telencephalic development [3,4], we do not expect these genes to have substantially different functions and target genes at these two
stages.
Quantification of networks
The strength of the relationships in GRNs were quantified
to calculate the posterior probability distribution for the
strength of the linkages based on the fold changes seen in
the gene expression datasets [8]. A log-linear function was
used to describe relationships between genes:
n

ln(G i ) = α i +

∑I

ji β ji

ln(G j ) + ε i

(1)

j =1, j ≠ i

where αI is the level of gene expression independent of the
network, Iji is an indicator function (0, 1, -1) if a linkage
exists from gene j to gene i, βji is the degree to which
change in gene j will affect change in gene i, Gj is a variable
associated with the relative expression level of gene j compared with normal level j, ei is the random error in predicted value for gene i and n is the number of genes in the
network.
The posterior distributions for the linkages in each network were derived using Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) sampling methods as described elsewhere
[8,34]. For the current analysis, KO and GOF effects on
genes are modeled as dedicated parents where the prior
for α i is set to zero; all other α are assumed to have normal priors. The priors for the β are assumed normal with
mean zero and variance σ = 1. Finally, ei is assumed to be
normally distributed with mean zero and variance σ 2,
where σ 2 is assumed to have a uniform prior with support
defined by the observed data. The MCMC maximum sampling step sizes are 0.05 for the σ, 0.08 for the β, and 0.05
for the α, and 500,000 iterations were performed with
decimation of every 10th value. The last 50,000 iterations

were used to establish the mean value of β ji and the significance of this value. Statistical significance of the
parameter β ji is defined by less than 5% of iterations with
β ji ≤ 0. To address the specificity of our method, we have
permuted the gene labels from the microarray experiments (n = 12,357) generating 100 random datasets of
gene expression. We then applied these datasets to quantitate the lit-based network to determine the number of
times we see significance of these connections from each
randomly generated dataset. It should be noted that gene
expression correlations across experimental conditions
are preserved in this analysis. Software for performing
these analyses is available from JMG.
Identification of potential co-factors for Ngn2 and Mash1
Consensus binding sites for Ngn2 and Mash1 were
defined as CANTWG and GCAGSTGK, or CAGSTG,
respectively, based in part on [12,28,29] and unpublished
data (DSC and FG) as described in Additional file 7. Due
to the scale of the bioinformatics method performed for
predicting co-factors, we limited our analysis to the
sequence surrounding 11 predicted Ngn2 target genes, 14
predicted Mash1 genes, and 6 common target genes based
on criterion similar to that used for in situ confirmation in
that we focused on the most differentially expressed as
well as the best candidate genes from the literature (Additional file 8). For each gene we looked at a minimum of
500 kb of sequences in front of (approximately 300 kb)
and behind (approximately 200 kb) including UTRs and
introns of the gene of interest and surrounding genes that
fell within the 500 kb range. We utilized the ECR browser
[86] to align human sequence with Mus musculus, Gallus
gallus, Xenopus tropicalis, Fugu rubripes, and Danio rerio
[87]. Sometimes no conserved regions were found within
our search limits, in which case we removed alignments
with the lower vertebrates (F. rubripes and D. rerio) and
only analyzed alignments to G. gallus and/or X. tropicalis
to find conserved non-coding regions. To further refine
the alignment, the web-based Mulan program was utilized, which performs a full local multi-sequence alignment that can account for evolutionary reshuffling and
inversions using the threaded blockset aligner program
[87,88]. From this analysis, evolutionary conserved
regions (ECRs) with a minimum length of 100 bp and
minimal percentage identity of 70% were defined. Finally,
we applied Multitf, which searches across the identified
ECRs for conserved TFBSs [88], to search for putative
Mash1 (GCAGSTGK or CAGSTG) and Ngn2 (CANWTG)
binding sites. In total, 160 conserved Ngn2 and 75 conserved Mash1 binding sites were identified. These sites
were distributed over the 500 kb analyzed, although the
highest number of sites was found in the 20 kb of
sequence surrounding the TSS (Additional file 12). Specifically, 19 Mash1 sites were found surrounding the 11
Ngn2 target genes (average number of sites per gene is

Page 13 of 18

BMC Biology 2008, 6:15

1.7) versus 56 Mash1 sites surrounding the 20 Mash1 and
common target genes (average number of sites per gene is
2.8). However, this difference is not statistically significant (p = 0.2). Furthermore, Ngn2 binding sites are found
just as often in front of Ngn2 targets versus Mash1 and/or
common target genes (82 Ngn2 sites were found surrounding the 14 Mash1 targets and 22 Ngn2 sites were
found surrounding the 6 common targets versus 58 sites
found surrounding the 11 Ngn2 target genes). The similarity between Ngn2 and Mash1 and potential function in
central nervous system development suggests Mash1 targets could be regulated by Ngn2 as well, in the telencephalon or other tissues. In addition, we note that Mash1
target genes are not equivalent to a random set of genes
when analyzing for enrichment of Ngn2 sites. With
regards to enrichment of Ebox sites in our putative target
genes, the CONFAC analysis described below allowed us
to show that several Ebox matrices were significantly
enriched in the sequence surrounding our predicted Ngn2
and Mash1 target genes when compared with 250 randomly selected genes (Additional file 9).
To identify potential co-factors, we searched for all vertebrate TRANSFAC annotated TFBSs within 30 bp upstream
and downstream of the putative Ngn2 or Mash1 binding
sites. The 30 bp length was based in part on prior research
showing active modules containing Pou and bHLH binding sites within 15 bp of each other [12]. We removed
those TRANSFAC annotated TFBSs that overlapped considerably with the putative Ngn2 and Mash1 sites including the following TRANSFAC matrices: E12, E2A, Heb,
Hen1, Hand1, E47, Ebox, myogenin, NeuroD, Myod,
Areb6, Tal1, Lbp1, Ap4, E47, and lmo2com. We also collapsed all similar TRANSFAC matrices that referenced the
same family of transcription factors (for example, Pou
domain containing factors and SRY domain containing
factors) or were for the same transcription factor, but
identified in different vertebrate species. TRANSFAC
matrices were mapped to current mouse gene identifiers
by following the original reference for the matrix found in
TRANSFAC through the literature. To identify the most
likely co-factors for Ngn2 and Mash1, we performed the
Fisher's exact two-sided test with p < 0.05 to test for significantly enriched TFBSs in sequence surrounding Ngn2
sites versus Mash1 sites or vice versa. Gene expression
from wild-type dorsal and ventral telencephalon tissue
was analyzed to predict differential dorsal or ventral
expression patterns of the predicted co-factors using a 1.5fold change cut-off. These were subsequently compared
with in situ analyses found in online databases (Additional file 10).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/15

Identification of putative co-regulators of Ngn2 and
Mash1 targets
Promoter region sequence (10,000 bp upstream of TSS)
from mouse and human orthologs of Ngn2 predicted targets and Mash1 and Mash1/Ngn2 predicted common targets (only those with RefSeq IDs associated with them)
was automatically uploaded from the UCSC database via
the CONFAC website [89]. CONFAC then identifies conserved TFBSs from the TRANSFAC database version 7.0 in
the human and mouse sequence alignments [30]. As part
of the CONFAC software, the Mann-Whitney statistical
test was then applied to test for enrichment of TFBSs in the
given gene lists. We compared each list with a list of 250
randomly picked genes available from the CONFAC website, as well as comparing our Ngn2 list with the Mash1/
common targets list and vice versa. We then annotated the
resulting lists of enriched TRANSFAC TFBSs as described
above. Transcription factors that did not show minimal
expression (> 4.5 median intensity) in wild-type microarray datasets were not analyzed further.
Algorithm-based network structure
The TAO-Gen algorithm identifies the optimal gene regulatory network given a specific gene expression dataset
[34]. Briefly, our method utilizes a log-linear model
(Equation 1) and MCMC to identify the network that best
accounts for the variability seen in the microarray datasets. In order to explore larger networks, the number of
possible networks in the search space is restricted. This is
accomplished through use of an annealing algorithm that
combines aspects of the Metropolis algorithm used for
MCMC sampling and a simulated annealing algorithm
used for optimizations. The maximum number of parents
for any given gene is restricted to three; however, no complexity penalty was used. Based on standard techniques in
Bayesian networks [90], we include all network structures
within the top 95% of scores based on the maximum likelihood and build a common network that includes those
interactions that occur in more than 50% of these network
structures. A detailed description, as well as a complete
evaluation of this method through statistical simulation
studies has been described previously [34]. We have also
performed detailed comparisons to another Bayesian network algorithm [35], which was subsequently coded for
Matlab [36]. Results are described in detail in Additional
file 1.

An informative prior structure was built utilizing several
different data sources. The informative prior structure is
represented as a matrix with 0 meaning forbidden connection, 1 meaning required connection, and 0.5 meaning no
prior information is available. We considered 25 literature-based connections as required connections, based on
previous literature data that is consistent with the current
microarray data, which are highlighted in the resulting

network. Genes whose functions are known and do not
include direct transcription factor activity or DNA/RNA
binding are forbidden from being parents, with the exception of the signaling molecules Wnt7b and Dll1, which
are known initiators of transcription via Wnt/β-catenin
and Notch pathways, respectively.

Parents are required to be expressed in the same tissue as
children (greater than 4.5 median intensity (log2 base) in
wild-type datasets); therefore, solely dorsally expressed
genes are not permitted to parent ventrally expressed
genes and vice versa. Each TFBS information source is
given an informative prior value of 0.1, such that if a TFBS
is found in a sequence in front of a given gene, the prior
score is raised from 0.5 to 0.6. TFBS data were derived
from both comparative genomics analyses described
above. Results obtained with and without the prior structure are described in Additional file 1.
