Abstract
Background: Panicum streak virus (PanSV; Family Geminiviridae; Genus Mastrevirus) is a close relative of Maize streak virus (MSV),
the most serious viral threat to maize production in Africa. PanSV and MSV have the same leafhopper vector species, largely
overlapping natural host ranges and similar geographical distributions across Africa and its associated Indian Ocean Islands.
Unlike MSV, however, PanSV has no known economic relevance.
Results: Here we report on 16 new PanSV full genome sequences sampled throughout Africa and use these together with
others in public databases to reveal that PanSV and MSV populations in general share very similar patterns of genetic exchange
and geographically structured diversity. A potentially important difference between the species, however, is that the movement
of MSV strains throughout Africa is apparently less constrained than that of PanSV strains. Interestingly the MSV-A strain which
causes maize streak disease is apparently the most mobile of all the PanSV and MSV strains investigated.
Conclusion: We therefore hypothesize that the generally increased mobility of MSV relative to other closely related species
such as PanSV, may have been an important evolutionary step in the eventual emergence of MSV-A as a serious agricultural
pathogen.

Background
Panicum streak virus (PanSV) is one of seven known African streak virus species within the Mastrevirus genus of the
Geminiviridae. The best studied and most economically
relevant species amongst the African streak viruses is
Maize streak virus (MSV) which seriously constrains maize
production throughout most of sub-Saharan Africa [1].
Like MSV, African streak virus species such as Panicum
streak virus (PanSV), Sugarcane streak virus (SSV), Sugarcane
streak Reunion virus (SSRV) and Sugarcane streak Egypt virus
(SSEV) are transmitted by various leafhopper species in
the genus Cicadulina and have geographical ranges that
are apparently restricted to Africa and its neighboring
islands [1-7].
Whereas African streak virus species such as Eragrostis
streak virus (ESV), Saccharum streak virus (SacSV), Urochloa streak virus (USV) and SSEV have been relatively
poorly sampled and have therefore only ever been found
in individual African countries [2,8-10], better sampling
of MSV and PanSV has indicated that these species occur
throughout sub-Saharan Africa [11,12]. PanSV and MSV
display similar degrees of genetic diversity characterized
by the existence of multiple discrete strains, many of
which have distinctive geographical ranges [11,12]. Both
species also have what appear to be largely overlapping
host ranges. Unlike MSV, however, PanSV has no known
economic relevance in that it has only ever been found in
nature infecting wild grass species in the genera Urochloa,
Ehrharta and Panicum [3,11,13].
Despite it not having any direct impact on African agriculture, the diversity and phylogeography of PanSV could
still provide potentially useful information on other more
economically important African streak viruses such as
those that cause maize and sugarcane diseases. For example a recent comparative phylogeographic analysis of different MSV strains has indicated that the economically
relevant maize adapted MSV-A strain is probably moving
around Africa more freely than the closely related but
Digitaria adapted MSV-B strain [12]. Comparative analyses of the diversity and phylogeography of different African streak virus species could therefore help identify the
characteristics of MSV that facilitated its emergence as an
important agricultural pathogen.
It has also been determined that African streak virus species such as PanSV have contributed indirectly to the evolution of MSV through genetic recombination [11,14].
Recombination is a major force in geminivirus evolution
[15,16] and it appears to have played at least some role in
the emergence of a number of serious geminiviral crop
diseases [17-22]. At least seven of the eleven currently
described MSV strains (including the important MSV-A
strain) have apparently come into existence through

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/194

recombination between two or more other strains [12]. It
would be of great interest to determine whether such
inter-strain recombination has featured as prominently in
the diversification of other African streak viruses such as
PanSV.
Here we use 23 full PanSV genome sequences sampled
throughout Africa and one of its neighboring islands to
show that there generally exist very similar patterns of
diversity, recombination and geographical structure
within PanSV and MSV populations. Our results indicate,
however, that the maize adapted MSV-A strain is possibly
unique amongst PanSV and MSV strains in both its total
geographical range and the rates at which individual virus
variants within the strain are moving across Africa.

Results and discussion
Discovery of five new PanSV strains
Sixteen full mastrevirus genome sequences were cloned
and sequenced from Brachiaria deflexa, Panicum maximum,
Panicum trichocladium, Urochloa maxima and Ehrharta calycina plants sampled from South Africa, Mozambique,
Kenya, Nigeria, the Central African Republic and the
Indian Ocean island of Mayotte (Table 1). All shared
greater than 80% genome-wide identity with PanSV
genomes currently deposited in public databases and were
therefore all classified as being PanSV isolates. After confirming that plots of pairwise genetic similarity between
all fully sequenced PanSV genomes closely matched those
previously determined for MSV (Additional file 1), we
used the 93% identity rule that has been used as a MSV
strain demarcation criterion [14] to tentatively classify the
PanSV isolates. This 93% identity threshold represents a
logical, if not natural cutoff for classifying MSV and PanSV
strains (Additional file 1) and it indicated that amongst
the new sequences there potentially existed five new
PanSV-strains (named PanSV-E to -I; Figure 1). It should
be noted, however, that this classification scheme relied
on the use of similarity measurements that exclude alignment gaps as missing data. Many other geminivirus classification schemes, such as the 75% and 89% thresholds
endorsed by the ICTV for respectively demarcating mastrevirus and begomovirus species [23], do not specify how
alignment gaps should be handled during similarity
measurements. If we had included alignment gaps as a
fifth character state - as is often done either accidentally or
by design when arguments are made for or against new
isolates being considered as new species - the 93% MSV/
PanSV strain demarcation threshold would drop to
between 90 and 91%.

Although the newly described PanSV-I strain represented
the most divergent group of PanSV isolates yet discovered,
we found no major genomic features that could distinguish this or any of the other newly described PanSV

Recombination between PanSV strains
It has been previously determined that recombination has
featured prominently in the evolution of MSV strains [12]
and that it may have also contributed substantially to the

diversification of PanSV [11]. We therefore analysed the
PanSV sequences for evidence of inter-species and interstrain recombination events using a battery of recombination detection and analysis methods implemented in the
program RDP3 [24]. We identified clear evidence of three
inter-species (labeled a, b, d, e, f, and h in Figure 1 and
Additional File 7) and six inter-strain recombination

events (labeled a, b, d, e, f, and h in Figure 1) within the
PanSV sequences.
The pattern of recombination we observed in PanSV is
very similar to that which has been described for MSV
[12]. For both species most detectable recombination
events have involved intra-species sequence exchanges.
The few inter-species recombination events that have
been detected in both species have also all involved the
exchange of small (<200 nt) tracts of sequence.
Another similarity between the two species is that many of
the described strains have apparently arisen through interstrain recombination events. For MSV all currently sampled isolates of seven of the eleven described strains
(MSV-A, -F, -H, -J, K, C and D) share evidence of ancestral
inter-strain recombination events that involved exchanges
of genome fragments >30% of the full genome [12]. Likewise, exchanges of >30% genome size fragments are evident in all sampled representatives of five of the nine
PanSV strains (PanSV-B, -C, -H, F and G).
The patterns of recombination seen in PanSV and MSV,
where inter-species recombination events generally
involve exchanges of only small genomic fragments
(<10% of the full genome length), is quite different to that
seen amongst related whitefly transmitted geminiviruses
in the genus Begomovirus [15,16]. In these viruses interspecies recombination is very common and often involves
exchanges of large (>30% of the full genome length)
genome fragments. This difference is due, at least in part,
to differences between the species classification criteria
used for mastreviruses and begomoviruses. Whereas the
main begomovirus species demarcation criterion is that
DNA-A or DNA-A-like sequences (begomoviruses often
have two component genomes where the DNA-A component of such genomes is largely homologous to mastrevirus genomes) sharing <89% identity belong to different
species, the analogous mastrevirus species demarcation
threshold is 75%. If the begomovirus classification
scheme were applied to PanSV and MSV then, many of the
inter-strain recombination events detectable in these species would be "upgraded" to inter-species recombination
events.
It is still noteworthy, however, that detectable recombination events between more distantly related PanSV and
MSV genomes have been less frequent and have tended to
involve smaller sequence exchanges than recombination
events between more closely related genomes. It is possible that the observed ratios of intra:inter species recombination events in PanSV and MSV might be partially
attributable to mixed infections involving different mastrevirus species being rarer than mixed infections involving
different strains of the same species. Although many of

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/194

the different African streak virus species share hosts such
as Urochloa and Eragrostis species, there are probably
greater host-range differences between viruses in different
species than there are between viruses within the same
species. Such differences should surely influence the relative frequencies of mixed species and mixed strain infections and should therefore also influence the relative rates
of inter-species and intra-species recombination events.
The most striking difference between the inter- and intraspecies recombination events in these viruses is, however,
not their relative frequencies, but rather the relative
amounts of sequence that have been exchanged in these
different recombination event categories. This pattern of
recombination in fact conforms very well with the
hypothesis that a major determinant of recombinant fitness is how well foreign DNA fragments function within
the context of genomic backgrounds that they did not coevolve within [25-29]. Functional nucleotide sequences
tend to work best within genomes that are similar to the
ones in which they evolved [25,27,30]. The probable reason for this is simply that the interaction networks that
define the functionality of a particular nucleotide
sequence within any given genomic context could potentially be disrupted if that sequence were placed into a
genome where it was forced to interact with nucleotide
sequences different from those it co-evolved with. As the
relatedness between prospective parental sequences drops
so too should the proportion of their genomes that could
be exchanged without disrupting the delicate intragenomic interactions required for optimal fitness [27,31].
The net effect of this process should be that amongst (presumably high fitness) genomes sampled from nature, one
should tend to observe larger sequence exchanges
between more closely related genomes than are detectable
between less closely related ones. This is the exact pattern
of recombination seen in both PanSV and MSV, suggesting that rather than inter-species recombination events
being uncommon due entirely to different mastrevirus
species only rarely infecting the same hosts, they are
uncommon because of genetic constraints on the relative
viability of inter-species recombinants.
PanSV and MSV phylogenies display similar patterns of
geographical structure
It has been previously demonstrated that there are strong
signals of geographical structure within the phylogenetic
trees of both the maize adapted MSV strain, MSV-A
[14,22], and the grass adapted MSV strain, MSV-B [12].
These two strains differ, however, in the degree to which
viruses have been moving across Africa [12]. Whereas no
MSV-B isolates have ever been detected in West Africa,
there have apparently been no movements of MSV-B isolates between East Africa, southern Africa and the Indian

strain to these three locations. Conversely, in the time
since MSV-A first spread throughout the continent there
have apparently been multiple instances where these
viruses have moved between the major regions of Africa
[12,22].
We sought to determine whether similar phylogeographic
patterns exist amongst the currently sampled PanSV
sequences. Taking note of the locations from which
sequences were sampled, we compared the PanSV and
MSV phylogenies (Figure 2) and noted some striking similarities between them with respect to the geographical
ranges of the various distinct strain groupings represented.
Besides both MSV and PanSV strains clearly grouping
according to their sampling locations, it is evident that
PanSV (Figure 2a) and grass adapted MSV strains (Figure
2b) from East Africa, Southern Africa and the Indian
Ocean islands are generally more closely related to one
another than they are to viruses from West Africa. Taken
together with the MSV data, the PanSV sample therefore
provides additional evidence that, in general, African
streak viruses may move more freely between East Africa,
southern Africa and the Indian Ocean islands than they
do between these regions and West Africa [12]. This pattern is notably different from that seen for both the maize
adapted MSV-A strain and whitefly transmitted geminiviruses in the genus Begomovirus. Whereas island begomovirus populations display strong evidence of extensive
isolation from mainland lineages [32,33], there is good
phylogeographic evidence, particularly for cassava infecting begomoviruses, of lineages moving between the major
regions of the continent [34]. Cassava infecting begomoviruses might, however, represent a special case in that cassava is propagated from cuttings and its viruses might
therefore be moved more extensively by humans than
viruses infecting seed propagated hosts.
Unlike with the wild-grass infecting MSV and PanSV
strains, the maize adapted MSV-A strain (Figure 2c) has
apparently moved quite extensively throughout the continent with the Indian Ocean islands being relatively more

isolated than West Africa [12,35]. There is in fact clear evidence of at least one fairly recent movement of a MSV-A
lineage from East Africa to West Africa (see arrow indicating the green clade nested within the orange clade in Figure 2c). Similar east to west movements across Africa have
been detected in various other vector-born plant viruses
including whitefly transmitted cassava infecting geminivirus species [34,36] and the beetle transmitted sobemovirus species, Rice yellow mottle virus [37,38]. It remains to
be determined, however, whether movement of MSV-A
and perhaps these other viruses too is natural or whether
it is facilitated by human trafficking of infected plant
material/viruliferous vectors [12,39]. It is also currently
unknown whether PanSV, the grass adapted MSV strains
and MSV-A are adapted to transmission by either different
Cicadulina species or different biotypes within these species. MSV-A is transmitted with varying efficiencies by different Cicadulina species [40], and it remains a strong
possibility that differences in the geographical distribution and migration routes of different preferred vector
species might also account for differences in the movement patterns of these virus groups across East and West
Africa.
The final subtle difference between the grass adapted
MSV-strains and the PanSV dataset are the genetic distances between viruses found in different regions. Since
the same demarcation threshold was used in both the
MSV and PanSV strain classifications it is perhaps interesting that in no case was any PanSV strain detected in more
than one of the surveyed regions. Members of each of the
MSV-B -C, -E,-F and -K strains have been isolated across
multiple geographical regions (three for MSV-B and two
each for the rest). Assuming that the PanSV and grass
adapted MSV strains are evolving at approximately the
same rate, this observation indicates that over the timescales represented by these phylogenies, MSV moves more
frequently than PanSV between the regions examined.
Without comparative analysis of PanSV and MSV substitution rates, however, it cannot be discounted that, rather
than moving at different rates, the two species are simply
evolving at different rates. It is also possible that with bet-

ter sampling the isolates of different PanSV strains will, as
is the case for MSV, be found in multiple different regions
of Africa.
With these reservations noted, it is nevertheless interesting that just as MSV-A seems to be moving across Africa
with less restraint than grass adapted MSV strains, the
grass adapted MSV strains are in turn apparently moving
more freely across the continent than PanSV strains. It is
therefore possible that the evolution of epidemiological
traits enabling MSV to move more rapidly than PanSV
across Africa was important for the eventual evolution of
still faster rates of MSV-A movement.

Conclusion
Among 16 new PanSV isolates sampled across Africa and
the Indian Ocean island of Mayotte we have potentially
discovered five new PanSV strains. Together with other
currently sampled PanSV genome sequences these new
PanSV isolates indicate that there exist striking similarities
between PanSV and MSV with respect to both detectable
recombination patterns and degrees of geography-associated population structure. Although similarities between
PanSV and MSV are perhaps unsurprising considering that
these viruses share common leafhopper vector species and
partially overlapping host-ranges, it remains interesting
that both MSV strains in general, and the MSV-A strain in
particular, seem to be less constrained in their movements
across Africa than PanSV strains.

(Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, USA) or using a Qiagen
Plant miniprep DNA kit (Qiagen, Germany) and circular
DNA molecules were amplified using φ 29 DNA polymerase (TempliPhi™, GE Healthcare). The amplified concatamers were digested with BamHI, SalI or XhoI restriction
enzymes to release ~2.7 kb PanSV genomes which were
subsequently ligated to similarly linearised pGEM3 Zf(+)
(from Promega Biotech). The cloned PanSV genomes
were sequenced by Macrogen Inc (Korea) using primer
walking. Sequences were assembled and edited using
DNAMAN (version 5.2.9; Lynnon Biosoft) and MEGA
(version 4)[45].
Diversity Analysis
34 African streak virus full genome sequences, including
all those available in GenBank for PanSV [3,11], and representative selections of MSV [12], USV [10], ESV [8], Sugarcane streak virus [4,8], Sugarcane streak Egypt virus [2],
and Sugarcane streak Reunion virus [2,8], were obtained
from GenBank. These were aligned together with the 16
new PanSV sequences using POA (vesion 2) [46] and
edited by eye using MEGA. For purposes of assigning
PanSV sequences to different strain groupings using the
93% rule of Martin et al [14], MEGA was also used to calculate the pair-wise differences between aligned PanSV
genomes using p-distances with pair-wise deletion of gaps
(as opposed to scoring gaps as a fifth nucleotide state).
Alignments used in earlier phylogeographic analyses
described in [12] and [22] were merged (with duplicate
sequences being discarded) and realigned with MEGA.

Methods
Virus Isolates
Sixteen grasses presenting with mild streak symptoms
characteristic of African streak virus infections were sampled from various locations in Africa and the Indian ocean
island of Mayotte: one Brachiaria deflexa sample from
Central African Republic; four Panicum maximum samples
from Mayotte; one Urochloa maxima and one Panicum
maximum sample from Nigeria; four Panicum maximum,
two Brachiaria deflexa and one Panicum trichocladium samples from Kenya; one Ehrharta calycina sample from South
Africa and one Panicum maximum sample from Mozambique (locations and names are provided in Table 1). The
Nigerian isolate, PanSV-H [NG-Jic15-PNP-1997], and the
Kenyan isolates, PanSV-E [KE-Jic10-PKPM-1997] and
PanSV-I [KE-Jic13-PKPB-1997] (respectively referred to as
P(N)P, P(K)P-M and P(K)P-B in [5,41]), were sampled in
~1987 but were maintained for approximately ten years
within Panicum maximum under glasshouse conditions at
the John Innes Centre in Norwich prior to leaf tissues
being harvested and frozen. Full length PanSV genomes
were amplified from leaf tissues using rolling circle amplification, cloned and sequenced using methods described
previously [42-44]. Briefly, total DNA was either extracted
from leaf tissues using Extract-n-Amp™ Plant PCR Kit

Recombination and phylogenetic analysis
Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were constructed
using PHYML (version 1)[47] with automated best-fit
model selection under the Akaike information criterion as
described in [48].

Discreet recombination events were detected using the
RDP [49], GENECONV [16], BOOTSCAN [50], MAXCHI
[51], CHIMAERA [52], SISCAN [53], and 3SEQ [54]
methods implemented in the program RDP3 (version
3.32;
available
from
http://darwin.uvigo.es/rdp/
rdp.html)[24]. Only potential recombination signals
detected by at least three of the seven applied recombination detection methods, coupled with phylogenetic evidence of recombination were considered significant
evidence of the signals representing genuine recombination events. Parental and recombinant sequences were
identified from the sets of sequences used to detect recombination events as outlined in [55] and [56]. Recombination breakpoint positions and recombinant/parental
designations were manually checked and adjusted where
necessary using the extensive phylogenetic and recombination signal analysis features implemented in RDP3.
