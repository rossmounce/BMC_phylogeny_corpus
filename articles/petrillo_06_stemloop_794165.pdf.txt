Abstract
Background: Prediction of secondary structures in the expressed sequences of bacterial genomes
allows to investigate spontaneous folding of the corresponding RNA. This is particularly relevant
in untranslated mRNA regions, where base pairing is less affected by interactions with the
translation machinery. Relatively large stem-loops significantly contribute to the formation of more
complex secondary structures, often important for the activity of sequence elements controlling
gene expression.
Results: Systematic analysis of the distribution of stem-loop structures (SLSs) in 40 whollysequenced bacterial genomes is presented. SLSs were searched as stems measuring at least 12 bp,
bordering loops 5 to 100 nt in length. G-U pairing in the stems was allowed. SLSs found in natural
genomes are constantly more numerous and stable than those expected to randomly form in
sequences of comparable size and composition. The large majority of SLSs fall within protein-coding
regions but enrichment of specific, non random, SLS sub-populations of higher stability was
observed within the intergenic regions of the chromosomes of several species. In low-GC
firmicutes, most higher stability intergenic SLSs resemble canonical rho-independent transcriptional
terminators, but very frequently feature at the 5'-end an additional A-rich stretch complementary
to the 3' uridines. In all species, a clearly biased SLS distribution was observed within the intergenic
space, with most concentrating at the 3'-end side of flanking CDSs. Some intergenic SLS regions
are members of novel repeated sequence families.
Conclusion: In depth analysis of SLS features and distribution in 40 different bacterial genomes
showed the presence of non random populations of such structures in all species. Many of these
structures are plausibly transcribed, and might be involved in the control of transcription
termination, or might serve as RNA elements which can enhance either the stability or the
turnover of cotranscribed mRNAs. Three previously undescribed families of repeated sequences
were found in Yersiniae, Bordetellae and Enterococci.

Background
The tremendous flow of information generated by large
scale genome-sequencing provided, as far as the prokaryotic world is concerned, the complete DNA sequence of
over 200 bacterial strains, and more are becoming available every month. Most annotation work has been directed
to the assessment of the protein repertoire encoded by a
given microbe, aiming to the genome-scale reconstruction
of bacterial metabolism [1], the identification of gene sets
unique to pathogenic microorganisms [2,3] or the development of new vaccines [4]. The availability of massive
amount of sequence data also stimulated in depth evaluation of the organization of the bacterial chromosome [59]. The basic organization of the genetic material (DNA
curvature and stacking energy, base and oligo skews, etc.;
see ref. [10]), and the presence of simple or more complex
sequence repeats [11,12] have also been analyzed for
most sequenced bacterial genomes.
Information associated to the folding of specific, single
stranded sequence regions into secondary structures is relatively ill-defined in prokaryotes. Prediction of RNA secondary structures may show different and even
contrasting results, depending on the methodologies and
the genomic regions evaluated [13-15].
In bacteria, protein coding sequences may be regarded as
able to be transcribed and to form predictable secondary
structures, although in many instances the spontaneous
folding of the corresponding mRNA may be affected by
interactions with the translation machinery. Stem-loopstructures (SLSs) in RNA may in turn control transcription, as in the attenuation mechanism [16], or influence
translation, as SECIS elements do for the insertion of
selenocysteine at stop codons [17]. Secondary structure
prediction is very effective for relatively small RNA with
defined ends, especially when corroborated by phylogenetic data, but it is more ambiguous in larger RNAs, where
SLSs, especially those containing short stems, are easily
formed, or lost, when a sliding window is used to tentatively delimit the boundaries of a folding domain.
Longer stems significantly contribute to the formation of
complex secondary structures where they affect RNA stability and functionality. Many non coding RNA structures
are known to fold around a stem which delimits either a
small, simple, single-strand loop or a larger, highly structured sequence. Examples are found in self-splicing
introns [18], riboswitches [19], transcribed intergenic
repeats such as E.coli BIME, Yersinia ERIC and Neisseria
NEMIS sequences. In these cases the stem is often essential to the attainment of the correct secondary structure
and may be directly recognized by ribonucleases [20-23].
Some predicted SLSs might also form in DNA and affect
its conformation: base pairing of single stranded DNA is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/170

known to play a role in recombination, replication and
transcription [24-26].
Here we present a systematic analysis of SLS distribution
in prokaryotic genomes. Sequences able to fold into stemloop structures featuring relatively large (12 or more bp)
stems have been searched and analyzed in 40 whollysequenced bacterial chromosomes. SLSs found in
searched bacterial genomes are more numerous and more
stable than those randomly expected to form in sequences
of comparable size and composition. The enrichment of
specific SLS sub-populations may be observed within
selected intergenic regions (IGRs).

Results
Identification of stem-loop structures (SLSs)
A relatively large number of completely sequenced bacterial genomes is currently available, from different species
of medical, industrial or purely scientific interest. While
for some species only one or two strains have been
sequenced, for others, such as E. coli and Salmonellae, multiple variant strains have been sequenced, leading to overrepresentation of these sequences in available databases.
For the present study, we selected a set of 40 genomes
from different bacterial species (Table 1), constituting a
representative sample of the prokaryotic world in terms of
evolutionary distance, genome complexity and GC content.

Genomes of bacteria listed in Table 1 were analyzed to
identify all the single-strand sequence regions able to fold
into SLSs featuring double-stranded stem regions measuring at least 12 bp, and loops 5 to 100 nt long. GU basepairs within the stem were allowed. Similarly allowed was
a single mismatch or bulge located at least two matches
away from the ends of the stem. These settings were chosen in order to identify both short 'canonical' stem-loop
structures (i.e. with simple loops) and larger ones containing 'highly structured loops'. The number of SLSs found in
each bacterial genome, grouped according to the SLS position, relatively to the boundaries of known and predicted
genes annotated in the TIGR database, is reported in Fig.
1. SLSs are classified according to the following categories:
a) coding, entirely contained within a coding sequence,
located either on the sense or the anti-sense strand; b)
intergenic, entirely located between coding sequences; c)
end-spanning, spanning one of the ends of a coding
sequence. The number of SLSs ranges from the slightly
more than 20.000, in Mycoplasmae and other small
genomes, to about 200.000, in large genomes as those featured by Bordetellae and Pseudomonaceae.
The large majority of SLSs falls within, or spans the ends
of, genic regions; only about 10% of SLSs were found in
IGRs. This distribution is not surprising as it reflects the

SLSs in naturally occurring and reshuffled genomes
Fig. 2A reports the number of SLSs found, as a function of
genome size, in the subset of 22 genomes labeled a to v in
Table 1. As also shown in Fig. 1, larger genomes contain
more SLSs than smaller ones, and a rough linear correspondence between genome size and SLS abundance may
be observed (Fig. 2A). The same search, done on random
sequences of the same length and GC content as the original genomes, produces a lower number of SLSs, linearly
correlated with genome size, with the only exception of
Clostridium tetani and Rickettsia genomes (Fig. 2A). As
expected, for a given random genome, the number of SLSs
perfectly correlates with the sequence length, when
smaller fragments are tested (data not shown).

The attitude of a sequence to randomly give rise to stemloop structures is expected to depend on a number of features, such as base composition and word frequencies.
Moving away from the equally-split 25% frequency of
each base, or 50% GC content, sequence complexity is
reduced, and this facilitates the formation of complementary structures. This is easily seen in Fig. 2B, where SLSs
found in naturally occurring genomes are plotted against
GC content, after sequence length normalization. The
dotted line represents SLSs found in random sequences of
different GC content, all 1 Mbase long, produced by ten
runs of the reshuffle tool. Variations are always within a
very small (about 1%) range. As expected, random
sequences stochastically give rise to a number of SLSs,
which regularly grows from a minimum, for a 50% GC
content, to larger numbers as GC content either decreases
or increases (Fig. 2B).
Naturally occurring genomes feature a larger number of
SLSs. With the only exception of C. tetani, the number of
predicted SLSs is always higher, by several standard deviations, than in random sequences of comparable GC content, which is statistically significant for P < 0.0001 or
lower. This indicates that some non-random component
of the natural genome sequence is responsible for the
larger number of SLSs, which cannot be reproduced in the
shuffled sequences. Reduced complexity of the sequence
may be due to consistently repeating patterns in the natural sequence, such as the tendency to prefer the use of specific di- or tri-nucleotides, or higher order words, which
are not conserved in the shuffled genomes, or constraints
imposed by the presence of coding regions. To test these
effects, SLS found in natural genomes were compared to
those found in randomized genomes, produced by shuffling while keeping constant the frequency of words of
size ranging between 2 and 13 nucleotides. Shuffling
genomes by only preserving word frequencies does not
take into account the constraints imposed by the presence
of coding regions. For this reason an alternative method
(DS, double shuffle) for shuffling the natural genomes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/170

was devised, where for non-coding regions, dinucleotide
frequencies are preserved, whereas for coding regions
dinucleotide frequencies, encoded protein, and codon
usage are all preserved, as described in reference [15].
Each randomization was repeated ten times, with very
small changes in the number of SLSs found (typically
<1%). The results, for three genomes of different GC content, are reported in Fig. 3, where SLSs are classified
according to their stability (dG) and loop size. Progressively larger SLSs numbers are obtained by keeping the frequency of 2- to 4-nt words constant. For larger word sizes
the trend appears to slow down, and subsequent increases
only give rise to marginally higher numbers. Natural
genomes also contain more SLSs than sequences produced according to the second, more complex, model,
which distinguishes between coding and non-coding
genomic regions. The differences, also in this case, are typically above four standard deviations, significant for P <
0.0001 or lower. SLS numbers obtained with this method
are similar to those from genomes randomized by preserving 4- or 5-nt words. Interestingly, preserving larger klets ranging from 6 to 13, produces even higher numbers
than the random genomes obtained by preserving codon
usage.
Specific SLS subsets are selectively enriched in the natural
genomes. The largest differences are observed with higher
stability structures where the random component is
expected to be lower. SLSs including the smallest loops
(shorter than 20 bases) also appear to be more frequent in
natural genomes, possibly including specific classes of
RNA structures (Fig. 3).
Identification of specific SLS groups
From the previous data, it emerges that in most species the
pool of predicted SLSs shows a bias towards energy levels
and genome localization, which is highly indicative of the
inclusion of non-random SLS sub-populations. As folding
of SLSs containing larger 'loops' might produce alternative
structures, possibly excluding the expected stem, minimum energy structures were predicted both freely and by
imposing a constraint for SLS formation (see Methods).
Most higher stability (dG < -10 KCal/mol) SLS-containing
regions, when minimum energy structures are predicted
by imposing no constraint for SLS formation, produce
results within 5 KCal/mol of the SLS based structure (60
to 80% in practically all species, not shown). This indicates that, for these higher stability regions, the SLS containing structure is expected to be either the optimal or a
close suboptimal structure. The relative frequency of these
regions, within coding and non-coding genomic areas,
was determined in the 40 bacterial genomes listed in
Table 1. The results, reported in Fig. 4, were normalized to
genome length and total SLS genomic frequency. Only
SLSs entirely located within coding and intergenic regions

were counted. An evident enrichment in intergenic SLSs
can be observed in the genomes of all the low-GC firmicutes (a bracket in Fig. 4) and in a few proto-bacteria (be). In both H. influenzae and P. multocida (d and e,
respectively, in Fig. 4), the SLS enrichment reflects the
genomic over-representation of the decameric sequence,
known as DUS (for DNA Uptake Sequence), which plays
a role in transformation [27]. Most of the >~1000 DUS
repeats found in either species are localized in intergenic
spaces, and several are located next to each other in
inverted orientation [27,28]. We assessed that this fraction of DUS repeats accounts for the formation of higher
stability SLSs (not shown). The abundance of intergenic
SLSs in the R. conorii and N. meningitidis genomes (b and
c, respectively, in Fig. 4), correlates to the presence of species-specific palindromic repeats [29,30]. In contrast, the
enrichment in intergenic SLSs in low-GC firmicutes cannot be explained by the presence of large repeated DNA
families. In these genomes higher stability SLSs range in
size from 30 to 50 nt, and show heterogeneity in both
stem and loop lengths (not shown).
AT-rich terminator-like sequences in low-GC firmicutes
The analysis of higher stability, intergenic SLSs found in
low-GC firmicutes revealed that these elements are mostly
AT-rich, and frequently found close to the stop codon of
genes located upstream. Typical rho-independent transcriptional terminators are relatively short SLSs, in which
GC-rich stems made by 6 to 8 bp pairs are flanked on the
3' side by a stretch of 4 or more Ts [31-33]. To test the
potential for SLSs from low-GC firmicutes to act as terminators, the distribution of As and Us at their termini was
analyzed. Most (65 to 75%) of the higher stability SLSs
located immediately downstream from annotated CDSs
feature four Ts at their 3' border (Fig. 5, panel A, grey
bars). The number of SLSs exhibiting the same features
drops to 20%, or less, in other bacteria (Fig. 5, panels A
and B). Interestingly, in low-GC firmicutes more than
50% of the SLSs featuring four Ts at the 3' border carry
also four As at the 5' border (Fig. 5, panel A, black bars).
Again, SLSs with identical features are 5- to 10- times less
abundant in other bacteria (Fig. 5, panels A and B). The
concomitant presence in low-GC firmicutes of 4As and
4Ts respectively at the 5' and 3' SLS termini is not merely
due to the high AT content of their genome, but rather
appears to be the result of some functional selection. In
fact, very low numbers of SLSs with the inverted organization, namely carrying 5' 4Ts and 3' 4As, were found (see
Fig. 5).
Distribution of intergenic SLSs
The relative positions of higher stability SLSs within the
IGRs were analyzed in all the species listed in Table 1.
Based on the orientation of flanking CDSs, IGRs were
combined (Fig. 6) to form three intergenic spaces (IGS):

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/170

a) uni-IGS, between CDSs transcribed unidirectionally,
i.e. along the same orientation; b) conv-IGS, between convergently transcribed CDSs; c) div-IGS, between divergently transcribed CDSs. SLSs falling within each
intergenic space are accordingly referred to as uni-, convand div-SLSs. In all species uni-SLSs are the largest
(around 60%) SLS fraction, but no enrichment is
observed, as their number reflects the length of the uniIGS. In contrast conv-SLSs, which represent 20 to 30% of
total intergenic SLSs, are concentrated in a much smaller
space, as the corresponding conv-IGS covers 8 to 12% of
the overall intergenic space in practically all tested species.
Conversely, div-IGS, which covers 25–35% of the intergenic space, only hosts about 10% of SLSs. A corollary of
this distribution is that SLSs tend to favour, as a preferential location, the 3'- over the 5'- end of flanking CDSs. To
test this hypothesis also on the uni-SLSs, a representative
set of these regions were further sub-divided into three
sub-regions corresponding to the two 50 base spans
named left and right, respectively close to 3'- and 5'-ends
of the flanking CDSs, and the remaining, variable length,
intermediate subregion, named center. Short IGRs, which
could not be split into appropriate subregions, were not
included in the analysis. Similarly a small number of
extremely long regions, which might derive from inaccurate genome annotation, were not used. The number of
SLSs found in the described subregions (Fig. 7) shows that
also the uni-SLSs clearly favour the 3'-end location: in the
vast majority of species SLSs found within left subregions
outnumber by 2- to 4-fold those found in the equally long
right subregions.
SLSs spanning repetitive DNA elements
Some intergenic SLSs may coincide with, or be a modular
component of repeated DNA families. The clustering of
intergenic SLS at the 3'-end of genes opens the possibility
that this relative enrichment may be related to a functional role, not necessarily connected to termination. A
search for DNA repeats, known from literature to cluster
at the 3'-end of coding regions, revealed that REPs (repetitive extragenic palindromic sequences) found in E. coli
[34] and P. putida [35] are a component of the selected
population of 3'-end clustered SLS. By using SLSs as
BLAST query sequences, we could identify repeated, previously undescribed DNA elements in various species (Fig.
8A). The Bor repeats are short SLSs ranging in size from 26
to 30 bp over-represented in Bordetellae. The 30-mer is
found in numbers ranging from 42 to 75 in different Bordetella species, whereas the smaller 26 bp core is much
more abundant (Fig. 8B). Bor are found close to coding
regions, and share some similarity with the E. coli REPs
(Fig. 8A). Novel DNA sequence elements, larger than REPs
were found in Y. pestis and E. faecalis (Ype and Efa elements, respectively: Fig. 8A). Members of both DNA fam-

ilies tend also to be preferentially inserted close to the 3'end of annotated CDSs.

Discussion
The ability of a DNA or an RNA segment to fold into a
stem-loop structure derives from the presence of complementary bases, and such segments stochastically occur in
every large sequence, no matter the origin, even randomly
generated, provided that some level of balanced distribution of nucleotides within single strand is guaranteed.
This is certainly true in bacterial genome sequences, where
oligonucleotide distribution reveals compositional sym-

metries in a variety of complete genomes [36,37]. The
problem of evaluating the relevance of a particular motif
in terms of the likelihood of generating it by chance in a
given sequence has been extensively faced (see for example the work by Robin and coworkers [38] for the probability of finding a motif composed of two 'boxes'
separated by a variable distance). Here we chose an 'experimental' approach, based on randomized genomes produced by reshuffling the natural one, with two types of
constraints: preservation of a variety of k-let frequencies

a loop length < 30 nt, located 20 bp or less from the stop codons of CDSs (large grey bars) were screened for the presence of
either A- or T-tetramers or both tetramer types at the 5' and 3' borders. Border is defined here as the 10 nt long region
including, in each SLS, the first 5 nt of the stem and the 5 nt located immediately outside of the stem, either at the 5' or the 3'
side (see inset in panel A). A) For each analyzed species, the four bars respectively indicate the number of SLSs containing 5'T, 5'A-,3'T-and 3A'-runs of at least four identical residues. The black portions of the bars indicate the contemporary presence of
both 5'As and 3'Ts. The height of the light grey regions in the background represents the total number of SLSs in the analyzed

Classes of intergenic SLSs
Classes of intergenic SLSs. Based on the orientation of flanking CDSs, higher stability intergenic SLSs (dG < -10 KCal/mole)
have been sorted into three categories, as indicated at the bottom (see Results). The width of each stacked bar denotes the
fraction of SLSs belonging to the three categories. The thickness of the bars is proportional to the cumulative sizes of IGRs
(lengths below 25000 bp are not to scale, but are represented by a minimal bar width). Lines above bars represent the intergenic space, split by vertical dashes in three segments respectively corresponding, left to right, to the cumulative lengths of
IGRs flanked by unidirectionally, divergently and convergently transcribed CDSs. According to the parameters adopted, no
conv-IGS was found in the genome of M. genitalium (see row 13). Only IGRs ranging from 29 to 500 bp were taken into
account, since smaller regions can not contain the shortest detectable SLSs, and bigger ones might derive from inaccurate
genome annotation. Bacterial genomes are numbered 1 through to 40 as in Table 1.

noacid sequence and codon usage. SLSs found in naturally occurring genomes clearly outnumber those
expected from the result of similar analysis in their randomized counterparts (Figs. 2 and 3). It appears that natural genomes somehow tend to favour the formation of
specific sets of stem-loop structures, typically the more
stable ones. These sets significantly contribute to the
higher SLS numbers observed in naturally occurring
genomes, compared to their random counterparts. The
phenomenon has been observed in bacterial genomes
which widely differ in terms of size, GC content, evolutionary relatedness. Data are in agreement with literature
reports, showing that, in large-scale analyses of prokaryotic mRNA populations, coding regions had a significant
bias toward more local secondary structure potential than
expected [15].

cutes are atypical as transcriptional terminators, as most
of them carry, in addition to the canonical 3' U-rich tract,
a complementary A-rich tract at the 5'-end (Fig. 5). This
arrangement is known not to impair termination as, for
example, in the E. coli thr operon attenuator, the terminator features a GC-rich stem-loop flanked by 9 Us at the 3', and 6 As at the 5'-end, and site-directed mutagenesis has
shown that upstream adenines are neither essential, nor
detrimental to transcription termination [41]. The 4A/4T
containing SLSs found in low-GC firmicutes, when
located at a short distance from convergently transcribed
genes, may function as bi-directional terminators [42].
Alternatively, these AU-rich SLSs may serve additional
functions, such as mRNA stabilization, as point mutations
in transcription terminators are known to affect the stability of upstream RNA segments [43,44].

The evolutionary pressure promoting the potential formation of stem-loop structures at genome-wide level may
serve different functional purposes. At the DNA level,
stem-loop structures may play a role in replication, transcription, and recombination. However, as the vast majority of prokaryotic genomes is composed of expressed,
protein-coding, regions, the contribution to mRNA secondary structure formation should be taken into account
for most SLSs, especially those including G-U pairs. Most
SLSs fall within coding regions (Fig. 1), in agreement with
their size, which typically exceeds those of non-coding
regions by a factor of ten. Still, when evaluating their significance, ribosome coverage and formation of secondary
structures within protein-coding regions should be
regarded as alternative, ribosomes being expected to prevent the formation of most low stability mRNA structures.
Higher stability structures may however result in translational pausing, possibly used in regulatory mechanisms
such as attenuation [16]. In specific instances, coding SLSs
correspond either to remnants of transposon-like
sequences [30], or to regions encoding repetitive protein
domains, such as those found in the mycobacterial PE
genes or in anchored cell-wall proteins conserved in several microorganisms (not shown).

Bacteria other than low-GC firmicutes do not feature similar AT-rich terminator-like structures, still the distribution of SLSs within IGRs is clearly non random. When the
frequency of SLSs is analyzed according to the type of IGR,
all bacteria show a strong preference for SLSs within convergent, i.e. flanking the 3'-end of CDSs, rather than divergent IGRs (Fig. 6). Furthermore within unidirectional
IGRs, higher stability intergenic SLSs are also preferentially found within the 50 bp tract immediately following
the stop codon of the neighbouring CDS (Fig. 7). This distribution strongly favours the notion that most higher stability intergenic SLSs are transcribed, and may therefore
function at the RNA level. Although termination is the
expected role for a large fraction of them, especially in
bacteria where rho dependent termination is not relevant,
their number and the observed sequence features leave
open the possibility of additional roles, such as RNA stabilization, translational regulation by riboswitches and
attenuators [19,16]. Alternatively these SLS may be targeted by specific nucleases and rapidly degraded, thus
functioning as RNA instability determinants. Finally, it
must be recalled that some intergenic SLSs may be transcribed independently of the flanking genes. In recent
years several groups provided support to the notion that
prokaryotic intergenic sequences encode a variety of
small, non-coding (nc) RNAs fulfilling diverse functions
[reviewed [45]]. It will be of interest to assess whether
selected intergenic SLSs may lead to the identification of
novel nc-RNAs in RNA populations.

Although less numerous, SLSs tend to be more frequent
within the much smaller IGRs, where a typical bias
towards energy levels and genome localization may be
observed, highly indicative of specific, non-random, SLS
subpopulations. All the analyzed low-GC firmicutes feature a marked enrichment in higher stability intergenic
SLSs. Both structure and genomic location suggest that
most of these sequences may function as rho-independent
transcriptional terminators. The finding is not surprising
per se, since the transcriptional factor rho is not essential in
Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus, and other Grampositive bacteria with a low GC-content lack a rho
homolog [39,40]. However, SLSs found in low-GC firmi-

Some SLSs show strong similarity with each other, and
may be grouped into families of repetitive sequences.
Here we describe Bor sequences (Fig. 8), a set of palindromic elements, over-represented in all Bordetellae, which
recall in length and sequence the E. coli REP sequences.
Bor containing RNA may fold into hairpins similar to REP
RNA, and possibly play an analogous role, i.e. the stabilization of the cotranscribed mRNA [34]. The larger Ype and

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:170

Efa elements (Fig. 8) are members of less numerous DNA
families spread in the genomes of Y. pestis and E. faecalis,
respectively. These sequences are similar in size and abundance to other intergenic repeats, such as NEMIS in N.
meningitidis [22] and ERIC in Yersiniae [23], which are
cotranscribed with flanking genes and may fold into similarly organized RNA hairpins. Preliminary data indicate
that both Ype and Efa RNA elements may indeed enhance
the stability of cotranscribed mRNA sequences [De Gregorio E, Silvestro G and Di Nocera PP, unpublished results].
Quantitatively, members of these families only account
for a small fraction of intergenic SLSs. As revealed by a preliminary BLAST analyses (not shown), further substantial
similarities may be detected within the identified SLSs.
Each of these families may therefore be extended, by
including more elements sharing sequence similarity, but
not initially found because of the presence of defective, or
less pronounced, secondary structures. Further work will
be necessary to eventually obtain a systematic classification of bacterial DNA families spanning, or coinciding
with SLSs.

Conclusion
An in-depth analysis of SLS features and distribution was
carried out in 40 different bacterial species. Data suggest
that an evolutionary pressure preserved specific non random populations of higher stability SLSs in most of the
analyzed genomes. Many of these sequences are plausibly
transcribed, and may be involved in transcriptional and/
or post-transcriptional control. Specific SLS containing
sequences are members of three previously undescribed
families of repeated sequences found in Yersiniae, Bordetellae and Enterococci.

Methods
Genomic sequence data
Complete genomic sequences and their annotations
about CDS, rRNA and tRNA were downloaded from the
online repository made available at The Institute for
Genomic Research (TIGR). Automatic annotations have
been stored into a SQL database (SLS-DB), for further
analysis. PostgreSQL has been used as the SQL Database
Management System [46], according to techniques previously described [47,48].
SLS identification
SLS identification was performed by using the program
rnamotif of the package RNAMOTIF, version 2.1.2 [49]
according to the following rules:

-GU pairing in the stem was allowed
-the minimal stem length was 12 bp

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/170

-1 bulged or 1 mispaired base, at least two matches away
from the ends of the stem, was allowed.
As a consequence of the constraints imposed, the smallest
SLS that could be found is 29 bp. Due to the allowance for
GU pairing, rnamotif had to be run on both strands of the
input sequence. Completely overlapping SLSs were discarded by 6 runs of the rmprune tool, also from the
RNAMOTIF package.
The Gibbs free energy (dG) of each SLS containing region
was calculated by calling the built-in function efn2 of
rnamotif. The minimum free energy with no constraint for
SLS formation was obtained by running the program
mfold developed by Zuker and coworkers [50] on the SLS
sequences.
SLS pre-filtering
When two or more SLSs where found overlapping, only
the most stable one was counted.
Intergenic regions
Intergenic regions (IGRs) were derived, stored and annotated into the SLS-DB, according to the ORF collection
provided by TIGR. For some tests, IGRs of size ranging
from 29 to 500 bp were selected (see also legend to Figure
6).
Shuffled genomes
The program Shufflet [51] was used to generate random
sequences and to shuffle bacterial genomes by preserving
k-lets of different lengths. In order to shuffle sequences
with k-let higher than 6, Shufflet was compiled by setting
the variable MAXORDER to 15. An alternative shuffling
method (referred to as DS in Fig. 3), was used to take into
account the information about protein coding sequences.
Basically coding regions were shuffled by using the program Dicodonshuffle [15], while Shufflet set to k-let = 2 was
used for non coding regions.
