Abstract
Background: The synapsin III (SYN III) gene on chromosome 22q is a candidate gene for
schizophrenia susceptibility due to its chromosome location, neurological function, expression
patterns and functional polymorphisms.
Methods: This research has established the mRNA expression of SYN III in 22 adult human brain
regions as well as the methylation specificity in the closest CpG island of this gene. The methylation
specificity studied in 31 brain regions (from a single individual) was also assessed in 51 human blood
samples (representing 20 people affected with schizophrenia and 31 normal controls) including a
pair of monozygotic twin discordant for schizophrenia and 2 non-human primates.
Results: The results show that the cytosine methylation in this genomic region is 1) restricted to
cytosines in CpG dinucleotides 2) similar in brain regions and blood and 3) appears conserved in
primate evolution. Two cytosines (cytosine 8 and 20) localized as the CpG dinucleotide are partially
methylated in all brain regions studied. The methylation of these sites in schizophrenia and control
blood samples was variable. While cytosine 8 was partially methylated in all samples, the
distribution of partial to complete methylation at the cytosine 20 was 22:9 in controls as compared
to 18:2 in schizophrenia (p = 0.82). Also, there is no difference in methylation between the affected
and unaffected member of a monozygotic twin pair.
Conclusion: The variation in SYN III methylation studied is 1) not related to schizophrenia in the
population sample or a monozygotic twin pair discordant for schizophrenia and 2) not related to
the mRNA level of SYN IIIa in different human brain regions.

Background
Synapsins (SYN) encode for neuron-specific phosphoproteins which associates with the cytoplasmic surface of synaptic vesicles. They play critical roles in neurotransmitter
release, synaptogenesis and clustering of synaptic vesicles
at active zones and function as modulators of synaptic
strength by acting at both pre- and postdocking levels [1].

They secure synaptic vesicles to actin filaments controlling
the number of vesicles available for release at the nerve
terminus. They play a broad role during neuronal development, including the formation and maintenance of
synaptic contacts among central neurons. In humans distinct genes for SYN I (Xp11.4-p11.2), SYN II (3p) and
SYN III (22q12-q13) give rise to 10 distinct isoforms [2,3]

and each synapsin has a specific role during the elongation of undifferentiated processes and their posterior differentiation into axons and dendrites [4]. The primary
protein domains A, C and E are conserved among all
major SYN isoforms and SYN III has a novel domain J
[2,3]. The isoforms of SYN III can be divided into neural
(IIIa to IIId) and nonneural (IIIe and IIIf) based on their
expression [3]. Further, although isoforms IIIa to IIIc are
present in fetal and adult brain, IIIa is clearly the predominant isoform expressed in adult brain [3]. Isoform IIId is
only expressed in fetal brain [3]. The gene encoding SYN
III is a candidate for schizophrenia susceptibility as polymorphisms in the promoter and coding regions of SYN III
have been implicated in schizophrenia [5-12]. Also,
expression studies have identified some differences in
SYN in patients with schizophrenia [13-16]. Such results
although encouraging does not offer an unequivocal support for a definitive role of SYN III in this heterogeneous
and common disease. They suggest that any role for SYN
III in schizophrenia, if present, is not obvious.
It is important to note that schizophrenia (SZ) is a complex disorder. Evidence of genetic risk factor(s) in schizophrenia is based on family and adoption studies [17,18].
Concordance for schizophrenia in monozygotic twins
(MZ) is reported to be ~41–86% as compared to 16% in
dizygotic twins [19-23]. The reduced concordance
(<100%) for this disorder in MZ twins suggests that not all
schizophrenia determinants involve gene mutations [24].
Also, a number of non-genetic risk factors in the causation
of schizophrenia have been recognized that include malnutrition, dietary folate, viral infections, birth order,
obstetric complications and other random events [25-29].
Also, epigenetic factors, particularly DNA methylation of
CpG islands in promoter and enhancer regions of transcriptionally active genes have been proposed for the etiology of schizophrenia [30-36] as alterations in the
methylation pattern may alter the level of mRNA and/or
protein [37-39]. Some of the potential loci that may be
affected by methylation in schizophrenia include SOX 10
[40], COMT [35,36] and DRD2 [41], but the direct role of
the gene specific methylation in schizophrenia has not
been established. In a recent study involving epigenetic
profiling of promoters Mills et al. [42] found evidence for
psychosis-associated DNA-methylation differences in
numerous loci, including several involved in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission, brain development, and other processes functionally linked to
schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. This phenomenon
has the potential to be a promising area of research in
schizophrenia. This phenomenon has been hypothesized
and reported in a number of human diseases [43] and
may account for discordance of monozygotic twins [44].
This hypothesis is particularly attractive in schizophrenia,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2350/9/115

since searching for traditional genetic mutations have not
yielded reproducible results.
Since SYN III remains an attractive candidate gene for
schizophrenia, this study assesses the expression of SYN
IIIa (the predominant isoform in adult human brain) and
cytosine DNA methylation of SYN III's closest CpG island.
The results provide a detailed evaluation of the expression
of SYN IIIa, as well as the pattern of cytosine methylation
in SYN III's distal CpG island in 31 human brain regions
from one human male. Also, included are methylation
studies on the blood genomic DNA from 20 schizophrenia patients and 31 unaffected controls and a pair of
monozygotic twin discordant for this disease. The results
identify cell type specific brain SYN III mRNA expression
differences, and two CpG sites that are differently methylated in the brain and blood samples. These results are
compared to those obtained from non-human primates.

Methods
Source of DNA and RNA
This research was undertaken following an approval from
the Ethics Review Board of the University of Western
Ontario. This report is based on the analysis of 82 human
and 2 non-human primate DNA samples. The 82 human
DNA samples represent 31 different human brain regions
(from one individual) and 51 blood samples (20 schizophrenia patients [SZ1–SZ20] and 31 un affected controls
[C1–C31]) from Southwestern Ontario, Canada. Each
patient and control was assessed for signs and symptoms
of schizophrenia using DSM IV. All diagnosis was made
by Richard L. O'Reilly (Clinical Psychiatrist). The 31 brain
samples representing specific brain regions were obtained
from Ambion (Austin, TX) who coordinated a custom
autopsy on a 63-year old Caucasian male that died of liver
cancer. No information was available on the patient's
treatment and medication but the donor's serology results
were negative for HIV, Syphilis, HBV and HTLV. The 2
non-human primate (cynomologous monkey and
baboon) blood samples were obtained from the animal
care facility of the University of Western Ontario.

DNA was extracted from fresh blood using QIAamp DNA
blood Maxi Kit (Qiagen; Valencia, CA) while RNA was
extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. DNA from 31 frozen
brain tissue was extracted using DNAzol (Molecular
Research Centre; Cincinnati, OH). Only 22 of the 31 specific brain regions yielded RNA using TRIzol (Invitrogen;
Carlsbad, CA). cDNA synthesis from total RNA was made
using Superscript II (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA) and purified using QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen; Valencia, CA).

SYN III's distal CpG island
The SYN III sequence (Accession number Z83846) was
subjected to annotation for gene organization that
included exons, introns and CpG island. The closest CpG
island is located ~50 kb upstream from SYN III ATG site
in a putative SYN III enhancer region (Figure 1A). A portion of this region formed the focus of methylation studies using modification of genomic DNA by sodium
bisulfite. PCR primers were developed for sodium
bisulfite modified genomic DNA (Figure 1B) for use in
amplification and sequencing of this region from all samples.
Sodium Bisulfite Conversion of gDNA
We modified a previously established method [45].
Briefly, 2 ug of each DNA sample was cut overnight with
Hind III (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA) at 37°C. Completely
digested gDNA was phenol/chloroformed and reprecipitated with 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.1) and 100% ethanol. The pellet was vacuum dried and re-suspended in 40
uL of sterile water. The purified Hind III digested DNA was
exposed to sodium bisulfite, which in theory converts
unmethylated cytosine to uracil while methylated
cytosines remain unaltered. The DNA was purified with a
Wizard DNA Clean-up System (Promega; Madison, WI)
following the manufacture's protocol. Desalted samples
were reprecipitated with 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.1) and
100% ethanol. The pellet was vacuum dried and resuspended in 100 uL of sterile water.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2350/9/115

PCR amplification of sodium bisulfite treated gDNA
Two primers compatible to the sodium bisulfite converted
sequence of the distal CpG island (Figure 1B) were optimized in a 25 uL PCR reaction to amplify a 157 bp fragment. Each sample was PCR amplified. The 25 uL aliquot
was run on a 6% PAG, stained with ethidium bromide
and photographed using an Alpha Innotech Gel Doc System.
Sequencing of sodium bisulfite amplified PCR
The PCR band was excised, crushed, suspended in water
and DNA eluted overnight at 37°C. The polyacrylamide
was separated from the DNA aqueous using a Costar Spin
X column (45 um filter). DNA was precipitated with 3 M
sodium acetate (pH 5.1) and 100% ethanol. The pellet
was vacuum dried and resuspended in 20 uL of water. Two
5 uL aliquots of this DNA were each diluted in 9 uL of sterile water and 5 uL (20 pmoles/uL) of the Fwd or Rev
primer. These 19 uL solutions were sent for sequencing at
the London Regional Genomics Sequencing Facility of the
University of Western Ontario, London Ontario. PCR
products were directly sequenced using dGTP chemistry
and an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) 377 ABI
Automatic Sequencer. The resulting fluorograms allowed
the identification of methylation for each cytosine in the
sequence. As a further confirmation of the sequence of the
sodium bisulfite PCR product was undertaken on the
monozygotic twin pair, SZ19 (affected with schizophrenia) and C2 (not affected) following cloning in Promega's
PGEM-T Easy Vector (Madison, WI). Six clones from each

sense strand of NCBI of SYN III gene and its distal CpG island on chromosome 22q12 (A) and the nucleotide sequence (antiGenomic organization Accession Number Z83846, nucleotides 87366 to 87522) used for methylation analysis (B)

PCR reaction (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to amplify 360,
983 and 958 bp fragments respectively. Each sample was
PCR amplified (linear phase was empirically determined
to be 25 cycles), and the 25 uL aliquot was run on a 6%
PAG, stained with ethidium bromide, photographed and
quantitated using an Alpha Innotech Gel Doc System.
These RT-PCRs were repeated three times i.e. first with the
original cDNA, repeated with the same cDNA and
repeated with fresh cDNA (made from the original
mRNA).

Results
Expression of SYN IIIa in human brain
SYN IIIa mRNA quantitation in 22 brain regions for
which the RNA samples were obtained was based on three
experiments (original cDNA, repeat of orginal cDNA and
fresh cDNA from original RNA) involving semi-quantitative RT-PCR (Figure 2). The expression of SYN IIIa in each
case was assessed in relation to two housekeeping genes
(GAPD and Actin), that were used as internal controls. The
results show that the SYN IIIa was expressed in most brain
regions examined. However, the level of expression was
different in different regions of the human brain. Relatively higher expression was seen in the cortex (temporal,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2350/9/115

visual and cingulated), cerebellum and BA5 caudal bank
while lower expression was seen in the amygdala, pons,
internal capsule and temporal cortex (superior). Further,
the expression of this mRNA was very low or absent in
putamen, lentiform nucleus, red nucleus, thalamic
nucleus, caudate nucleus (body), crus cerebri cerebral and
caudate (head and body). The results establish that SYN
IIIa expression is variable in the human brain regions. In
comparison, the SYN IIIa mRNA was not detected in the
blood sample, under the sensitivity of the methodology
used.
Cytosine methylation in SYN III's distal CpG island in the
human brain
Figure 1 shows the genomic organization of the human
SYN III gene and DNA sequence of a portion of the distal
CpG island used for studies on cytosine methylation. This
region contains 26 cytosines that are numbered 1 to 26 in
a 3' to 5' direction towards the reverse primer. The direct
sequencing of the PCR product of sodium bisulfite modified gDNA on ABI sequencer has allowed us to assess the
fluorograms as called by the sequencer and further
appraised by visual observation. Here, a comparison of
sodium bisulfite modified gDNA sequence with the NCBI
sequence accession number Z83846 show G, A or T nucleotides at all the expected sites. Theoretically, the methylated cytosines are maintained at their original positions
while unmethylated cytosines have been converted to T.
Also, all cytosines in CpG dinucleotides are unaffected by
the sodium bisulfite and cytosines in CpN (where N is not
guanine) were completely converted. Note, the unmethylated cytosines in the sequence being investigated serve as
controls that the sodium bisulfite pretreatment is working

appropriately. Overall, the results suggest that only
cytosines in the CpG dinucleotides are subject to methylation in this region of the genome. A close examination of
the fluorograms revealed that one of the 3 CpG (cytosine
8) was partially methylated in all DNA samples that
included regions of brain and the blood. This partial
methylation was read as an N by the sequencer or showed
a C as well as T (or G and trace of A on the complementary
strand) peaks to different degrees. Table 1 summarizes the
methylation specificity of the cytosines at the CpG dinucleotides in the 31 brain specific regions. The degree of
cytosine methylation at these CpG dinucleotides was estimated to range from ~50 to 80% (Figure 3). What is also
apparent is that the degree of methylation of CpG dinucleotides in this genomic region is specific to different
regions of the brain. Given that the brains regions examined were derived from a single individual, the results may
or may not be representative for all brains.
SYN IIIa methylation in schizophrenia patients
Methylation patterns in the proximal CpG island of SYN
IIIa of DNA from blood samples from patients with schizophrenia and normal controls were similar to those generated from human brain as cytosine methylation was
restricted only to the CpG sites, only. The methylation
pattern at cytosine 8 in 20 patients and 31 controls (Table
2, Figure 4) was comparable but not identical. Here the
methylation of the cytosine 8 was similar in the blood and
brain but unlike the brain, cytosine 20 in blood samples
was either partially (~50–80%) or completely methylated.
The distribution of the cytosine 20 partial (22 controls
and 18 schizophrenia patients) vs complete (9 controls
and 2 schizophrenia patients) methylation was not different (Table 2, χ2 = 3.14, p = 0.08) in this sample from
Southwestern Ontario. Further the methylation results on
the monozygotic co-twins discordant for schizophrenia
was not different. Additional familial results also sug-

gested that the pattern of methylation for cytosine 8 and
20 is compatible with familial inheritance. Interestingly,
the sequence of this genomic region is conserved in nonhuman primates and its methylation in the two nonhuman primates (cynomologous monkey and baboon) is
similar to the human blood (Figure 5).

Discussion
The SYN III gene has remained a putative candidate for
schizophrenia, by virtue of its function [1,4], expression
[3,13-16], linkage and association [5-12] in humans and
synaptic trafficking alterations associated with knockout
mice for Syn I and Syn II [46]. Overall, the published
reports on association and co-segregation of DNA polymorphism and schizophrenia although indicative, are not
without exceptions and a definitive role for SYN III in this
complex and heterogeneous disease, remains to be estab-

lished. Because epidemiological studies of schizophrenia
fail to support candidate gene mutation of Mendelian origin, we hypothesized that epigenetic mechanisms (i.e.,
cytosine hypermethylation of CpG islands present in the
promoter of this genes) may partake in the down-regulation of this gene in patients with schizophrenia. This
study reports novel results on the neuronal expression of
SYN III, methylation specificity associated with its distal
CpG island and its implications in schizophrenia and
expression of this gene in the human brain.
Expression and cytosine methylation of SYN IIIa in the
human brain
The results included in this report support previous
reports citing SYN III and in particular SYN IIIa expression
in adult brain [2,3]. Further, it establishes that the SYN
IIIa expression in the brain is region and tissue-type specific. The question of how this variability is achieved is of
interest, which must be assessed in relevant cell-types.
Determinants of differential SYN III expression may influence or determine a normal expression of this gene. Any
abnormality in such determinants particularly CpG methylation in SYN III's CpG island may cause SYN IIIa associated abnormalities.

The SYN III cytosines examined show that cytosine methylation is restricted to CpG dinucleotides only. This pattern is seen in all tissues and cell-types analyzed (i.e. 31
brain regions, genomic DNA from human blood and
blood DNA from two nonhuman primates). Such results
argue that the observed pattern of methylation is an inherent and conserved feature of this region of the human
genome. Within this region, cytosine 8 is partially methylated while cytosine 20 is either partially or fully methylated in human brain (Table 1), human blood (Table 2)
and blood samples from nonhuman primates. Of interest
is the observation on partial methylation. In addition, the
results argue that in absence of prohibitive brain tissues,
readily available blood DNA may serve as a source for
such studies. Similar methylation in human and nonhuman primate blood DNA in this sequence conserved
region may suggest that this methylation is evolutionarily
relevant and could be biologically significant.
Also, the individual specific partial/full methylation at the
cytosine 20 site across individuals may imply epigenetic
polymorphism in the population. In this context the
nature and source of this variability remains hypothetical
and may represent an aspect of parent of origin effect. The
relevance of this polymorphism in human brains could
not be assessed as the 31 brain regions assessed were
derived from a single individual. More important, since
methylated and unmethylated cytosine 20 was observed
in DNA from patients with schizophrenia as well as the
controls and this distribution was not significantly different between the two groups, it was ruled out as being
involved in schizophrenia. This conclusion is also supported by the results on monozygotic twin pair discordant
for schizophrenia (Figure 5). These and other results
included further argue that this epigenetic polymorphism

is a genetic property of this DNA sequence that is selected
and maintained across generations and during phylogeny.
Interestingly, the twin pair studied in this research was 51
years of age. The identical methylation at these sites in
twin pairs may suggest that this site is not subject to aging
effects [44]. In conclusion, the results included in this
report offer support for variation in the level of CpG
methylation in this part of the SYN IIIa gene promoter,
however it is not involve in the development of schizophrenia or the variable expression of this gene in the brain
regions. Future experiments are required to explain tissue
specific SYN III mRNA expression differences.
