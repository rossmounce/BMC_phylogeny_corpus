Abstract
Background: The evasion of host immune response by the human malaria parasite Plasmodium
falciparum has been linked to expression of a range of variable antigens on the infected erythrocyte
surface. Several genes are potentially involved in this process with the var, rif and stevor multigene
families being the most likely candidates and coding for rapidly evolving proteins. The high sequence
diversity of proteins encoded by these gene families may have evolved as an immune evasion
strategy that enables the parasite to establish long lasting chronic infections. Previous findings have
shown that the hypervariable region (HVR) of STEVOR has significant sequence diversity both
within as well as across different P. falciparum lines. However, these studies did not address
whether or not there are ancestral stevor that can be found in different parasites.
Methods: DNA and RNA sequences analysis as well as phylogenetic approaches were used to
analyse the stevor sequence repertoire and diversity in laboratory lines and Kilifi (Kenya) fresh
isolates.
Results: Conserved stevor genes were identified in different P. falciparum isolates from different
global locations. Consistent with previous studies, the HVR of the stevor gene family was found to
be highly divergent both within and between isolates. Importantly phylogenetic analysis shows
some clustering of stevor sequences both within a single parasite clone as well as across different
parasite isolates.
Conclusion: This indicates that the ancestral P. falciparum parasite genome already contained
multiple stevor genes that have subsequently diversified further within the different P. falciparum
populations. It also confirms that STEVOR is under strong selection pressure.

Background
Plasmodium malaria is an infectious disease of global significance with more than 500 million people suffering

from the disease and at least one million dying each year
[1]. The P. falciparum genome project [2] has revealed the
presence of several multicopy gene families which code

for hypervariable antigens that are exported to the surface
of the infected host erythrocyte and represent targets of
naturally acquired immunity to malaria. To date var, rif as
well as stevor have been described [2-4] as the major variant surface antigens (VSAs). These multigene families are
predominantly situated at the sub-telomeric ends of chromosomes [2,5,6], where gene rearrangements are frequent
[7,8] leading to high rates of recombination, thus facilitating their rapid evolution and diversity.
While some rif and var genes are found in centrally located
clusters, most stevor genes are found at chromosome ends
[2]. The high sequence diversity of proteins encoded by
these gene families may have evolved as an immune evasion strategy that enables the parasite to establish long
lasting chronic infections [9].
The P. falciparum genome contains between 50 and 60 var
genes [2] that code for the Erythrocyte Membrane Protein
1 (PfEMP1) [10-12]. EMP1 is linked not only to immune
evasion but also to parasite sequestration and pathology
and is by far the best studied multigene family in P. falciparum [11,13,14].
Stevor and rif share structural similarities and this relationship is emphasized by the existence of a RIFIN-STEVOR
family (PF02009) in the PFAM database [15]. Characteristically, they are defined as small polypeptides with a putative signal sequence followed by a semi-conserved
domain, an HVR and a conserved C-terminal domain
[16]. In both protein families, two predicted transmembrane-spanning regions flank the HVR which has been
predicted to form a loop on the infected red blood cell
(iRBC) surface, exposing it to the host immune system
and probably resulting in distinct evolution into novel
functional units [3,16]. However, STEVOR and RIFIN differ in that the HVR of RIFIN is up to 300 bp longer than
the equivalent region in STEVOR. Moreover, STEVOR are
a distinct, more conserved, and lower copy number family
[17] than RIFIN. The rif and stevor (150–200 copies and
30–33 copies respectively in the 3D7 genome) repertoire
diversity has been studied in the 3D7 parasite clone, and
in several other laboratory parasite lines from different
geographic origins [18,19]. Based on these studies, it is
clear that the HVR of STEVOR has significant sequence
diversity both within as well as across different P. falciparum lines. These studies did not address whether or not
there are ancestral stevor that can be found in different parasites.
The entire genome of the P. falciparum 3D7 parasite clone
was sequenced completely first as part of the malaria
genome project [2]. A number of additional lines have
now also been at least partially sequenced so that there is
now considerable information on the VSA repertoire on

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/8/1/140

these parasite species. The ancestors of parasites isolated
worldwide are most likely to be from Africa [20]. A study
of var gene sequences in 12 Kilifi parasite isolates has
shown a comparable number of broadly classified types as
the 3D7 genome [21]. Similarly, another study of var
sequences from Amazonian parasite isolates indicated
that the expected gene repertoire was again similar to that
of the 3D7 genome and that the Amazonian var genes
were most similar to var identified in other American isolates [18].
The 3D7 var genes have been grouped into three majors
types based on sequence analysis of the intron and 5' and
3' un-translated regions (UTR) [2,22,23], and the Kilifi var
had a similar type distribution [21]. Recently, phylogenetic approaches have enabled subdivision of the RIFIN
protein family into two major A- and B-subgroups [24]
associated with distinct subcellular location and developmental expression patterns [25].
Such important data are currently missing for the stevor
multigene family and it is not known whether field isolates contain a similar number of stevor to that of the 3D7
clone. In addition, a more extensive study of stevor from
isolates worldwide is required in order to estimate both
the repertoire size and the extent of diversity. Comparative analysis of long-term laboratory-adapted parasites
and fresh clinical isolates has shown that laboratoryadapted lines are not significantly more or less divergent
than recent isolates [26]. However, the 3D7 clone was
shown to have accumulated DNA in culture through
insertions of +1nucleotide/kb [27], and this might suggest
divergent sequences compared to fresh isolates.
In this study, DNA and RNA sequence analysis were combined as well as phylogenetic approaches to analyse the
stevor sequence repertoire and diversity in laboratory lines
and fresh isolates from Kilifi in Kenya. Conserved stevor
genes (orthologues) were identified in different P. falciparum isolates from different global locations. Consistent
with previous studies, the HVR of the stevor gene family
was found to be highly divergent both within and
between isolates. Importantly, phylogenetic analysis
shows some clustering of stevor sequences both within a
single parasite clone as well as across different parasite isolates. These data indicate that the ancestral P. falciparum
parasite genome already contained multiple stevor genes
that subsequently diversified further within the different
P. falciparum populations.

Methods
Parasites
Parasites used in this study were either well-characterized
laboratory lines or were isolated from blood samples
obtained at the KEMRI-Wellcome Trust, Kilifi, Kenya. Par-

asite lines and their origin are listed (Table 1). The African
parasites were collected at Kilifi district hospital, situated
60 km north of Mombasa on the Kenyan coast. More than
10% of the children under five years of age, who reside
within the Kilifi district, are admitted into hospital each
year. In this area, P. falciparum transmitted by mosquitoes
of the Anopheles gambiae complex [28], is seasonal and
usually occurs after the long and short rainy seasons.
This study was approved by the Institutional Ethical
Review Board of Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, and by the Kenyan Medical Research Institute
National Ethics Committee
Culture of P. falciparum laboratory lines and Kilifi isolates
Laboratory parasite lines were cultured in fresh human
RBC (supplied by National UK Blood Donation Service)
in RPMI 1640 complete medium supplemented with
Albumax and 2 mM glutamine (Gibco) as previously
described [29]. Parasitaemia was monitored daily by
microscopy examination of Giemsa stained thin blood
smears.

Plasmodium falciparum parasite isolates from Kilifi were
recovered from liquid nitrogen frozen stock and cultured
in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% AB
human serum (Kilifi General Hospital, Kenya), 2 mM Lglutamine (Gibco), 37.5 mM HEPES (Gibco), 20 mM
Glucose, and 2 μg/ml Gentamycin (Gibco). No fresh red
blood cells (RBCs) were added and the parasites were
maintained in culture for approximately 30 hours, or
until they reached late trophozoite/schizont-stages. Parasite samples were separated into two fractions for later
processing of parasite genomic DNA (gDNA) and RNA
isolation.
Preparation of parasite genomic DNA (gDNA) and RNA
Plasmodium falciparum iRBCs were pelleted at 560× g for 5
minutes. Resulting pellets were stored at -80°C in screw
top cryovials. A phenol/chloroform extraction method
was used for larger (greater than 500 μl) iRBC pellets as
previously described [30]. The DNeasy® kit (Qiagen) protocols 1 and 2 were used for small (less than 500 μl) blood

samples according to manufacturer's recommendations.
Genomic DNA was resuspended in nuclease-free water.
For RNA isolation, iRBC pellets (approximately 100 μl)
were lysed in 1 ml prewarmed (37°C) Trizol LS reagent
(Gibco Invitrogen) and then stored at -80°C in screw top
cryovials. RNA was extracted as described previously [31],
using DNase I digestion (Invitrogen) to remove contaminating DNA. RNA was resuspended in nuclease-free water.
Primers designed for stevor specific PCR/RT-PCR
The primers were assessed using multiple sequence alignments to ensure that the chosen sequences were in regions
conserved within the stevor gene family, but not in other
genes (for example the rif gene family). A combination of
two sets of primers in a nested PCR was used RepF1,
RepF2 and RepR internal-PCR primers were designed as
previously described [16]. The RepF1/2 primers were redesigned to remove an opal stop codon (TGA) replacing it
with (TGC). The smf1/smr1 external primers were previously described [32]. All primers were synthesized by
Eurogentec/Oswel (Southampton, UK) or Research
Biolabs (Singapore). The use of a nested-PCR protocol for
RT-PCR was problematic due to amplification of contaminating gDNA, therefore a stevor-specific single step amplification was designed, facilitated by the complete genome
sequence [2], using the primers JBSTEVORF1 and
JBSTEVORR1. Primers sequences are summarized in Table
2.

DNA and RNA products were separated by electrophoresis
in 1% multi purpose agarose (Roche) in 1× Tris buffer
contained 0.25 μg/ml ethidium bromide to enable UV visualization. RNA gels contained 5 mM guanidine thiocyanate.
Small-scale preparation of plasmid DNA (minipreps)
Plasmid DNA was isolated using the QIAprep spin SNAP
Miniprep® Kit (Invitrogen). The QIAgen Maxiprep® kit was
used according to manufacturer's protocol to isolate larger
quantities of pET-24a (+) vector.

Automated DNA Sequencing
Following DNA expansion, purification, and confirmation that a stevor insert was present; the DNA was then
quantified by spectrophotometry, pelleted and dried
before sequencing.

Three systems have been used for sequencing reactions:
a) The BigDye® Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (Perkin-Elmer, Applied Biosystems, Warrington,
UK) was used according to manufacturer's instructions.
The reaction was carried out using approximately 600 ng
of pCR®2.1 or pCR® II DNA (vector plus insert) per sample
with either M13 forward or reverse primers in the Eppendorf Mastercycler. Unincorporated dye terminators were
removed by ethanol precipitation. Samples were resuspended in 3 μl loading dye 16.5% v/v Blue Dextran/EDTA
(Applied Biosystems) in formamide (Amresco, Solon
USA), followed by electrophoresis and data collection on
the ABI PRISM™ 377 DNA sequencer (Perkin -Elmer).
b) The BigDye® reactions were also used with T7 primers
and pET-24a (+) DNA, or TrxFus forward or T7 reverse
primers with pET102/D-TOPO DNA. Sequencing was performed at the National Neuroscience Institute, Singapore.
c) The MegaBACE system (Amersham Biosciences) was
used. The ABI PRISM® BigDye® Terminator v1.1 Cycle
Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) cycle sequencing
mix was used according to the manufacturer's protocols.
Samples were ethanol precipitated before addition of
MegaBACE™ loading solution (Amersham Biosciences)
and loading onto a MegaBACE 96-capillary machine.
Sequence alignment analysis (HVR region)
A fragment of approximately 280 base pairs (bp) was successfully isolated through PCR and RT-PCR amplification.
However, due to the variant nature of the HVR, sequences
varied in length, coding for a maximum of 82 amino
acids. Clones have been obtained from multiple PCR reactions to reduce PCR bias, and were sequenced in forward
and reverse directions. P. falciparum 3D7, IT and Ghana-

ian isolates sequences were obtained from BLAST and
Tools-oligo searches within PlasmoDB [33].
Editing of nucleotide and amino acid (translated)
sequences was carried out using the Autoassembler®,
Chromas®, DNAstar (2001) freeware programmes.
Sequences from different parasite sources and different
amplification reactions were aligned by using ClustalX®
[34], and Bioedit7.0.1® softwares. Multiple alignments
and their corresponding chromatograms were edited by
eye for discrepancies and mistaken nucleotide assignment
by the automated sequencing method. BLAST analysis,
version 4.4 from PlasmoDB [33] was used in order to confirm that DNA sequences were the result of the amplification of stevor exon-2 hyper-variable loop locus.
Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic trees showing genetic distance were constructed using the following programmes: Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) 2.1 or 3.0®, PAUP
version 4.0 [35,36], and Tree view® [37]. These programmes enable the construction of trees using threebuilding models: Neighbor-Joining, Maximum Parsimony and Maximum likelihood, taking into account the
observed nucleotide frequency, substitution rate and transition/transversion ratio, based on Nei genetic distance
estimates [35]. The bootstrap analysis [38] was used in
order to statistically assign support to hypotheses of phylogenetic relationship among sequences estimated by the
above-mentioned methods.

Results
Identification of common stevor genes in laboratory lines
and Kilifi field isolates
The P. falciparum genome sequencing project [2] as well as
subsequent sequencing efforts has given some insight into
the diversity of stevor in different P. falciparum lines. Still
these data are limited and, therefore, additional sequences
from both established laboratory lines and freshly isolated parasite samples would provide valuable additional
information. For this purpose, genomic DNA was
extracted from five different laboratory lines of various

geographic origins: A4; FcB1; C10; T9/96 and 3D7 (Table
1) and also from 10 representative blood samples taken
from patients in the Kilifi region of Kenya.
Genomic DNA was amplified using the previously
described stevor-specific nested primers flanking the predicted hyper-variable loop region [32] (Table 2). PCR
from all laboratory lines (Figure 1A) as well as Kilifi isolates (Figure 1B) gave amplification products of the
expected size (600 bp and 300 bp) indicating that these
primers were able to amplify stevor sequences from both
the laboratory lines and Kilifi field isolates. Similar to

two amplicons in the expected size ranges, products carried

PCR products (approximately 300 bp) from primers RepF1/2

what was found with the P. falciparum 3D7, more than
one PCR product was detected in the expected size range,
amplified by both the external (550–700 bp), and internal primers (250–350 bp) (Figure 1A). This is indicative
of the amplification of multiple stevor sequences from
both laboratory lines and field isolates. The 300 bp PCR
products from the different samples were cloned and a
number of clones were sequenced in both forward and
reverse directions. The sequence data obtained here from
genomic DNA was further expanded by the addition of
the transcribed stevor sequences which had previously
been obtained by RT-PCR from RNA extracted from the
same original blood samples [39].
Despite the low throughput approach, a total of 213
genomic DNA and RNA products were successfully
sequenced, 133 were unique DNA sequences [see Additional file 1] coding for 108 unique amino acid sequences.
Comparison with known STEVOR sequences confirmed
that the PCR and RT-PCR products indeed represented
STEVOR. The number of times each sequence was
obtained per isolate is shown (Figure 2A). Overall, six different stevor sequences were identified from genomic DNA
in the reference 3D7 clone isolated in The Netherlands
but of unknown geographic origin [40] that had been
included as a positive control. Interestingly, two
(3D7_2_41202 and 3D7_1_181202) of the sequences
obtained from the 3D7 clone maintained at the NIMR in
London were absent from the published 3D7 genome stevor repertoire (Figure 2A). All other stevor sequences
present in the 3D7 genome are shown with their gene
identification number for the purpose of comparison. Of
the 133 unique stevor DNA sequences, twenty-one were
found to be present in more than one parasite line or isolate (Figure 2A, asterisk), five (5) of these paralogues were
identified in A4, C10, FcB1 and D10 (blue asterisk), six
(6) were found in A4, C10 and FcB1 (green asterisk), three
(3) were found in T9/96, C10 and A4 (orange asterisk),
while two (2) were found in 3D7 and T9/96 (red asterisk),
3D7 and A4 (brown asterisk) as well as K11 and K14
(black asterisk). Finally a single sequence was found as
part of the 3D7 genome and K1640 (Figure 2A, pink asterisk). The highly represented stevor sequences most likely
represent "common" stevor that can be found in a variety
of parasite isolates from around the world. For a number
of these more common stevor transcription was also
detected by RT-PCR indicating that these genes are of
potential functional relevance.
From this initial analysis it is clear that there are a number
of stevor sequences that are common to a number of different laboratory lines; in contrast only a single sequence
(K1640_1_BD141105) from a Kilifi isolate was found to
be identical to a gene (PFL2610w) from the 3D7 genome.
In contrast despite the large number of stevor sequences

identified in the Kilifi isolates, only a single stevor
sequence was found to be present in more than one isolate. This particular sequence was transcribed in both K11
(K11+_111104) and K14 (K14+_1_111104) parasites
(Figure 2B).
The RT-PCR data indicate that stevor is transcribed in all
the P. falciparum lines examined with the exception of the
parasite clone A4, supporting previous observations that
this parasite clone does not transcribe nor express STEVOR [4,39]. This lack of STEVOR expression in the A4 parasite is not due to the absence of the genetic information
as this clone contains at least 20 different stevor genes (Figure 2A). In line with published observations [21] that
field isolates transcribe multiple var at the same time,
numerous unique stevor transcripts were also detected in
both laboratory and patient samples (Figure 2B).
Conservation of stevor across different parasite lines
The observation that identical HVR sequences could be
found in different parasite lines raised the possibility that
stevor could be grouped into distinct subgroups with different biological functions, similar to the rif and pir multigene family [25,41,42]. For this purpose the sequences
identified here, together with the corresponding regions
from the 3D7 stevor repertoire were clustered into similarity groups by constructing a Neighbor Joining as well as a
Minimum Evolution Tree (Figure 3).

The Neighbor Joining tree (Figure 3A) clustered the 152
HVR DNA sequences into two groups with one large subgroup containing approximately one-third of the stevor
sequences (Figure 3A, orange branch). This subgroup contained sequences from all parasites except the D10 laboratory line and the K14, K11 and K6 Kilifi field isolates. At
this stage it is not clear whether the absence of this subgroup of stevor in these parasites is a reflection of the limited sequence data available or truly represents a lack of
this subgroup. It is also interesting to note that there is further sub-clustering of sequences within this branch, where
clusters either contain sequences from the same line or
alternatively from a number of different parasites. The second large group containing the remaining two-thirds of
stevor sequences appears to contain numerous branch
points of related sequences rather than containing a single
defined cluster. These data would indicate that overall the
sequence divergence is much higher in this group.
Sequences obtained from a single parasite line also appear
to form distinct clusters, with each cluster containing a
number of different related sequences. This can be clearly
seen for T9/96 stevor (Figure 3A, blue circles) that contains
at least three distinct clusters. Similar clustering is also
seen for sequences from A4, C10, FcB1 and D10 with the
majority of sequences falling within just four sub-groups
(Figure 3A, green circles) while the majority of Kilifi iso-

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/8/1/140

lates stevor sequences were contained within seven clusters
(Figure 3A, yellow circles). Importantly, these specific
sequence clusters often also contain sequences from other
parasite lines or isolates indicating that they do not result
from a specific phylogenetic branch. Rather it appears that
while there is a trend for some sequences from the same
parasite to cluster together, most are distributed across the
tree and cluster with sequences from other strains. To further validate these findings, the stevor sequences were clustered using the Minimum Evolution tree construction
method at 95% significance bootstrap values (Figure 3B).
This approach produced the same clusters as the Neighbor
Joining method (compare Figure 3A with 3B). The 3D7
stevor repertoire is distributed throughout the trees (Figure
3A, B; pink points) with clusters containing a maximum
of two 3D7 sequences.
To assess whether or not this clustering of stevor DNA
sequences is maintained at the amino acid level, 108
unique STEVOR amino acid sequences were used to construct a Neighbor Joining as well as a Minimum Evolution
Tree with a bootstrap value of 85% or higher (Figure 4A,
B). The two approaches resulted in nearly identical trees
with a number of broad clusters containing sequences
from different lines and isolates. Using this analysis a single major sub-group was observed (highlighted by an
orange circle) reflecting an apparent trend for sequences
of the same geographic region to be more closely related
(Figure 4A, B). More precisely, one obvious cluster was
observed containing majority of Kilifi protein sequences
(Figure 4A, orange circle, yellow points). However, as
already identified in the DNA sequence trees, clusters are
not completely exclusive and a number of sequences from
laboratory lines are found within this cluster (Figure 4A,
orange circle, green, pink, blue and light blue points).
Conversely a number of Kilifi isolate sequences are found
distributed across the other branches of the tree where
they cluster both with other Kilifi sequences as well as
sequences from a range of laboratory lines (Figure 4, yellow points).
Similar to the outcome of the DNA sequence analysis, the
T9/96 amino acid sequences clustered within three small
sub-groups (Figure 4, blue circles) while sequences from
laboratory lines A4 (green), C10 (green), FcB1 (light blue)
could be found dispersed in different clusters on the tree
(Figure 4). Interestingly, the significant clustering seen
within the trees produced from the nucleotide sequences
(Figure 3) was also maintained at the amino acid level.
This clustering is consistent using either of two methods
for generating the phylogenetic trees.
This analysis was further extended to include all STEVOR
sequences including those from published databases (IT
and Ghanaian isolates) and 75 South American region

sequences obtained from Albrecht et al. (2006)[18]. A
total of 226 HVR amino acid sequences were used for the
analysis (Figure 5). However, no obvious cluster was
observed, though a number of non-significant groups
were present when the tree was condensed at 50% bootstrap values. The high divergence within the HVR encoding the predicted erythrocyte surface-exposed region of
the STEVOR family is likely in response to host immunity.

Discussion
The human malaria parasite P. falciparum is able to evade
the host's immune response by expressing a range of variable antigens on the surface of the infected erythrocyte.
Several genes are potentially involved in this process with
the var, rif and stevor [2] multigene families being the most
likely candidates and coding for rapidly evolving proteins.
The rapid changes are believed to result from a strong
immune-mediated diversifying selection [19,43,44].

In this study, the stevor sequence repertoire and diversity
were analysed in laboratory lines and Kilifi field isolates.
As expected the stevor family was found in all P. falciparum
genomes and was transcribed in all field and laboratory
parasites (exception for the A4 clone) with multiple transcripts being detected. This result is in line with previous
studies in which numerous var as well as stevor transcripts
were detected in single patient samples using a microarray
[45]. From the RT-PCR and sequencing data it is clear that
both in cultured laboratory lines and in patient samples a
significant proportion of the stevor repertoire is transcribed at the same time. In isolate K5 a total of 16 different sequences were detected; and despite the close
phylogenetic relationship between these sequences (Figure 3) at this stage it can not be ruled out that these transcripts arose from a multiclonal infection.
Recent phylogenetic studies have shown that the rif family
form two clear subgroups [24] that potentially can be further divided into functionally distinct subgroups [46].
This is clearly not the case for stevor where the presence of
distinct subgroups is not that strongly supported. Still
there is sufficient evidence to support some clustering into
different groups. Importantly, the identification of identical sequences in laboratory lines from different geographic regions as well as field samples would imply some
functional constraints acting upon this sequence. In addition sequences within the Kilifi isolates appear to be more
closely related to each other than to any of the laboratory
parasites, and no common stevor were found between Kilifi except for a single stevor sequence shared between one
Kilifi isolate and 3D7. The stevor sequence found in two
Kilifi isolates (K11 and K14) may represent a common
sequence detected in the two isolates and also seen in a
number of laboratory lines.

Conclusion
Conserved genes were identified in different P. falciparum
isolates from different global locations for example: A4,
C10 and FcB1 in particular, contain several closely related
stevor genes, suggesting that the ancestral P. falciparum parasite genome already had multiple stevor genes that may
have subsequently diversified further within the different
P. falciparum populations. The high sequence variability
observed is consistent with the HVR of STEVOR being
under strong selection pressure. On the other hand, there
is only weak evidence that STEVOR like the RIFIN can be
subdivided into distinct phylogenetic subgroups implying
that STEVOR function has less diversified in P. falciparum.
