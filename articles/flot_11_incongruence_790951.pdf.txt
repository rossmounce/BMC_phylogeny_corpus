genetically delimited species in the coral genus
Stylophora: phenotypic plasticity, morphological
convergence, morphological stasis or interspecific
hybridization?

Abstract
Background: Morphological data suggest that, unlike most other groups of marine organisms, scleractinian corals
of the genus Stylophora are more diverse in the western Indian Ocean and in the Red Sea than in the central IndoPacific. However, the morphology of corals is often a poor predictor of their actual biodiversity: hence, we
conducted a genetic survey of Stylophora corals collected in Madagascar, Okinawa, the Philippines and New
Caledonia in an attempt to find out the true number of species in these various locations.
Results: A molecular phylogenetic analysis of the mitochondrial ORF and putative control region concurs with a
haploweb analysis of nuclear ITS2 sequences in delimiting three species among our dataset: species A and B are
found in Madagascar whereas species C occurs in Okinawa, the Philippines and New Caledonia. Comparison of
ITS1 sequences from these three species with data available online suggests that species C is also found on the
Great Barrier Reef, in Malaysia, in the South China Sea and in Taiwan, and that a distinct species D occurs in the
Red Sea. Shallow-water morphs of species A correspond to the morphological description of Stylophora
madagascarensis, species B presents the morphology of Stylophora mordax, whereas species C comprises various
morphotypes including Stylophora pistillata and Stylophora mordax.
Conclusions: Genetic analysis of the coral genus Stylophora reveals species boundaries that are not congruent
with morphological traits. Of the four hypotheses that may explain such discrepancy (phenotypic plasticity,
morphological stasis, morphological convergence, and interspecific hybridization), the first two appear likely to play
a role but the fourth one is rejected since mitochondrial and nuclear markers yield congruent species delimitations.
The position of the root in our molecular phylogenies suggests that the center of origin of Stylophora is located in
the western Indian Ocean, which probably explains why this genus presents a higher biodiversity in the
westernmost part of its area of distribution than in the “Coral Triangle”.

Background
The reason why most marine life forms, including corals, display their peak of biodiversity in the so called
‘Coral Triangle’ in Southeast Asia remains mysterious
and much debated [1,2]. The rare examples of sea creatures that do not conform to this general pattern may
offer information crucial for our understanding of its
root causes, provided that a solid taxonomic framework
is available to interpret their present and past distribution (which is unfortunately rarely the case). Several
such exceptions to the ‘Coral Triangle’ rule can be
found in the scleractinian coral family Pocilloporidae
that comprises the three genera Pocillopora, Seriatopora
and Stylophora: although morphospecies of Seriatopora
are most diverse in the Coral Triangle and therefore
seem to follow the rule, Pocillopora “has what appears
to be many regional endemics, especially in the central
and far eastern Pacific” and Stylophora “has a higher
diversity in the western Indian Ocean and Red Sea than
in the central Indo-Pacific” [3]. However, ongoing
genetic studies of species boundaries in Pocillopora and
Seriatopora suggest that, even though morphological
descriptions of pocilloporid corals appear well founded
in some locations [4-6], in others places current taxonomy is a poor predictor of the actual number of species
[7-11].
Molecular studies of Stylophora have focused so far on
a single species, the “lab rat” Stylophora pistillata (Esper,
1797), without delving into the delineation of interspecific boundaries [12,13]. S. pistillata was originally
described “aus den ostindischen Meeren” [14] (from the
East Indian seas, in the “Coral Triangle”) as characterized by short twisted dichotomous branches

Page 2 of 14

("Madrepora aggregata, ramulis conglomeratis brevibus,
dichotomis; stellis crenatis profundis, pistillo in medio
elongato erecto” [14]; Figure 1, left side), and is considered to occur over the entire Indo-Pacific (from the Red
Sea to Polynesia). The distinction between S. pistillata
and Stylophora mordax (Dana, 1846) has long been
debated in the literature: S. mordax is considered by
some authors as a junior synonym of S. pistillata
[15,16,3] and by others as a distinct species [17-24]. S.
mordax was originally described from Fiji as having
“branches nearly simple, much compressed, not thinner
at apex, scarcely flabellate, 1/2 to 1 inch broad, and 1/3
of an inch thick; polyps with a pale yellowish disk, and
short tentacles of a bright green colour, deep brown at
base. Corallum with the cells strongly vaulted, and the
surface, therefore, decidedly scabrous” (Figure 1, right
side) [25]; however, intermediary forms between S. mordax and S. pistillata are commonly found in the field,
and the areas of distribution of these two morphotypes
are nearly identical, further adding to the confusion.
Another widespread species according to Veron [3] is
Stylophora subseriata (Ehrenberg, 1834), also found
across the Indo-Pacific region, whereas the five other
morphospecies of this genus are restricted to the Red
Sea and the Gulf of Aden (Stylophora kuehlmanni
Scheer and Pillai, 1983; Stylophora danae Milne
Edwards and Haime, 1850; Stylophora mamillata Scheer
and Pillai, 1983), to Madagascar (Stylophora madagascarensis Veron, 2000) or to both of these regions (Stylophora wellsi Scheer, 1964). Hence, the pattern of
occurrence of the various species of Stylophora seems to
contradict strongly the common “Coral Triangle” center
of biodiversity model. However, recent reports of S.

danae and S. kuehlmanni from the Philippines [26] have
started to question this pattern, raising further concern
that morphological species may not correspond to actual
genetic entities (and indeed, Sheppard and Sheppard
[27] considered S. danae, S. kuehlmanni and S. subseriata as ecomorphs of S. pistillata).
Experimental work has shown that S. pistillata is phenotypically plastic [28,29] under the influence of environmental parameters such as gravity [30] and water
flow [31]. Moreover, evidence of intergeneric hybridization between Stylophora and Pocillopora has been
reported in the literature [32], suggesting that hybridization may a fortiori occur among various Stylophora species. Finally, morphological stasis and phenotypic
convergence, albeit not reported yet in the genus Stylophora, may lead to further underestimation of the actual
number of species in this genus by causing several
genetically distinct species to be lumped under a single
name. To find out whether phenotypic plasticity, interspecific hybridization, morphological stasis and phenotypic convergence obscure the taxonomy of Stylophora,
we conducted a genetic analysis of 70 corals of this

genus collected in Madagascar, Okinawa, the Philippines
and New Caledonia; published sequences of Stylophora
individuals from Australia, Malaysia, the South China
Sea, Taiwan and Okinawa were also scrutinized (Figure
2). As a first step towards a future taxonomic revision
of this genus, we report here the result of our attempt
to determine the true number of Stylophora species
occurring at these various locations and to test whether
the unusual biogeographic pattern reported for this
genus holds true.

Results
Phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial sequences reveals
the presence of two Stylophora clades in Madagascar vs.
a single one in the Pacific Ocean

We successfully sequenced from all individuals sampled
a portion of the mitochondrial ORF and the putative
control region (CR), two markers that had previously
been characterised as highly variable in the closely
related genus Pocillopora [33] (but see [34,5] for a different interpretation of these regions). Since these markers gave results that were completely congruent, only

we collected samples, whereas empty circles mark locations where sequences were obtained from the literature. The area of distribution of the
genus Stylophora (modified from [3] and [68]) is shown in blue (basemap from http://d-maps.com/).

the result of their combined analysis is presented here
(Figure 3). The reciprocal monophyly of each pocilloporid genus received very strong bootstrap support
(100% using maximum likelihood, neighbor-joining and
parsimony), whereas three clades of Stylophora emerged
from the phylogenetic analysis: clade A comprised 12
individuals, all from Madagascar, clade B comprised 7
individuals, also all from Madagascar, whereas clade C
comprised the remaining 51 individuals from New Caledonia, Okinawa and the Philippines plus one previously
published sequence (from the complete mitochondrial
genome of one Stylophora pistillata individual from Taiwan [34]). All three clades were very strongly supported
(100% bootstrap support using all three methods).
Haploweb analysis of nuclear ITS2 sequences shows that
these three clades represent distinct species

We obtained nuclear internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2)
sequences from all individuals sampled, and analyzed
them together with the single published Stylophora ITS2
sequence available from GenBank (also from a Stylophora
pistillata individual from Taiwan [35]). Despite its multiple-copy nature and its concerted mode of evolution
[36], the ITS2 behaved in the present study just like a
“regular” single-copy nuclear marker, with each individual harboring either one or two sequence types. Moreover, most ITS2 sequences types found co-occurring in
some individuals were also observed occurring alone in
other coral colonies, suggesting that these sequence types
were allelic and segregated in a Mendelian fashion: for
this reason we decided to call “heterozygotes” all individuals found to possess two different ITS2 types, even
though we could not be totally sure that all ITS2
sequences obtained were really allelic (in the closely
related genus Pocillopora, for instance, three ITS2
sequences types were observed in one individual [6]).
Molecular phylogenetic analyses revealed many clades
of sequences, several of which were very strongly supported (Figure 4). In order to determine which of these
clades were conspecific and which ones belonged to different species, curves were added connecting sequences
found co-occurring in heterozygous individuals, thereby
converting the ITS2 tree into a haploweb [9]. This
approach revealed three distinct pools of ITS2
sequences, corresponding to the three clades obtained
from mitochondrial DNA. The monophyly of clades A
and B in our ITS2 dataset received very strong bootstrap
support using all three methods, whereas the monophyly
of clade C was only weakly supported using maximum
likelihood (<50% bootstrap support) and not at all supported using neighbor-joining and parsimony. None of
the 43 heterozygous individuals in our dataset contained
ITS2 sequences from two different clades: therefore,
clades A, B and C correspond to three distinct species

Page 4 of 14

according to the mutual allelic exclusivity criterion
[37,9].
Phylogenetic analysis of nuclear ITS1 sequences reveals
the existence of a fourth species of Stylophora in the Red
Sea

Even though the ITS2 of scleractinian corals is generally
easier to align and more informative than ITS1 [35] and is
therefore more commonly used, the vast majority of ITS
sequences available to date for the genus Stylophora are
ITS1 sequences. In order to compare the results of our
study with those previously published data, the ITS1
regions of 14 representative individuals from our molecularly defined species A, B and C were sequenced and
aligned with sequences available in GenBank. Alignment
was indeed markedly more uncertain for ITS1 than for
ITS2, and the resulting alignment was rather short (345
positions including many gaps, vs. 700 positions for ITS2
and 2645 positions for the combined mitochondrial markers); nevertheless, the resulting phylogeny revealed interesting patterns and is therefore presented here (Figure 5).
The three species delimited from the mitochondrial
and ITS2 datasets were recovered as distinct clades of
ITS1 sequences: the monophyly of species B was very
strongly supported (>98% bootstrap support using all
three methods), whereas the monophyly of species C
received weaker bootstrap support and the monophyly of
species A was very weakly supported. All previously published ITS1 sequences from Australia, Malaysia, the
South China Sea, Taiwan and Japan turned out to belong
to species C, whereas all published Stylophora sequences
from the Red Sea fell in a well supported fourth clade D
(>90% bootstrap support using maximum likelihood and
neighbor-joining) that can be considered a distinct species following the criterion of reciprocal monophyly.

Discussion
Haplowebs are useful tools to delineate species

The present study confirms the usefulness of our
recently proposed haploweb approach to deal with
sequences of nuclear markers [9]. Whereas the corresponding phylogenetic tree supported the delineation of
clades A and B but revealed a large number of clades
among our sequences from the Pacific Ocean, haploweb
analysis (Figure 4) showed that these various Pacific
Ocean clades are actually conspecific (since many heterozygous individuals harbor sequences from two different clades). The monophyly of species C was only very
weakly supported in the maximum-likelihood phylogeny
(with a bootstrap value of only 43%) and not at all supported using neighbor-joining and parsimony: therefore,
this species would probably not have been detected in
our ITS2 data if we had not taken into account the
information provided by the co-occurrence of

Figure 5 ITS1 molecular phylogeny of the genus Stylophora. In addition to ITS1 sequences from selected individuals of species A, B and C,
data from published articles [69,12,35,13] and from an unpublished study by Feng You and Hui Huang [GenBank: HM013847, HM013855,
HM013856] were included in the haplotree (generated with PhyML using the TPM2+G model suggested by jModelTest).

phylogenetically distant alleles in some individuals. In
contrast, haploweb analysis delineated three groups of
alleles among our ITS2 sequences, a result perfectly
congruent with the mitochondrial phylogeny obtained
from the same set of individuals.
Unlike in our previous article [9], the haploweb presented here was built on a tree rather than a network.
Indeed, tree-based haplowebs are more straightforward
to draw than their network-based counterparts, and are
also more informative since they display the genotype of
each sequenced individual. However, precisely due to

their larger information content, tree-based haplowebs
tend to become messy when dealing with large datasets
and/or non-monophyletic species: in such cases, network-based haplowebs often turn out to be faster to
draw and easier to interpret than tree-based ones.
Are molecularly delimited species of Stylophora
congruent with morphology?

Most of the 12 individuals from species A displayed the
characteristic morphology of S. madagascarensis (some
examples are shown on Figure 6): “colonies have thin

(left) and colony 07Mad097 (right) were both sampled at 30 meters
depth and have thicker, less compact branches compared with
typical S. madagascarensis morphology.

All 7 individuals of species B from Madagascar had
flattened stout branches (Figure 8). This corresponds
unambiguously to the morphological description of S.
mordax, but since S. mordax was originally described
from Fiji in the Pacific Ocean it is dubious whether this
name may be assigned to species B.
Species C gathered all individuals collected from locations in the Pacific Ocean. It is characterized by extensive morphological variation, comprising individuals
attributable to S. pistillata and others attributable to S.

07Mad074 sampled at 5 meters depth, colony 07Mad086 sampled
at 6 meters depth and colony 07Mad170 sampled at 11 meters

straight compact branches with small hoods). The green wire on

(up to 5 mm diameter), straight compact branches. Corallites are crowded and uniformly spaced on branch
sides and ends. They have a slight development of
hoods towards branch ends. They have small style-like
columellae and six primary septa which are fused with
the columellae. The coenosteum is covered with fine
spicules. Tentacles are not extended during the day.
Colour: Uniform tan, sometimes with pinkish branch
bases.” [38]. Since Veron’s holotype was collected from
the very same location in Madagascar where we conducted our sampling ("approximately 4 m depth, Tuléar,
south-west Madagascar” [38]), there is little doubt that
species A and S. madagascarensis are conspecific.
According to Veron’s description this species was
“recorded only from shallow reef environments exposed
to some wave action and, in south-west Madagascar, in
shallow sheltered lagoons” [38]. In contrast, we found
this species down to a depth of 30 meters, where it displayed less compact and thicker branches compared
with the typical S. madagacarensis morphology (Figure
7): hence, S. madagascarensis appears to be more ecologically widespread and morphologically variable than
previously thought.

as a synonym of S. pistillata [27]).
What causes the discrepancy between morphological and
molecular species delimitations in Stylophora?

mordax, as well as morphotypes somehow intermediary
in shape (Figure 9). Several colonies of this species collected in a very muddy location (Banc des Japonais in
New Caledonia) displayed a peculiar phenotype characterized by extremely elongated thin branches (Figure
10). Published sequences of S. pistillata from Taiwan
(ITS2, ORF) and from Okinawa, Taiwan, the South
China Sea, Malaysia and Australia (ITS1) grouped with
our sequences from species C, further supporting its
putative identification as S. pistillata.
Finally, all published ITS1 sequences from the Red Sea
fell in a distinct well-supported species D. The coral
colonies sequenced were collected at depths of 2-4
meters in the Gulf of Aqaba and reported under the
name S. pistillata [13], but according to another study
the main morphospecies of Stylophora found in shallow
waters in Aqaba is actually S. mordax [21]: therefore,
species D probably comprises a mixture of S. pistillata
and S. mordax morphotypes. Since the type localities of
S. pistillata and S. mordax are both in the Pacific
Ocean, another name will be required for species D
(possibly S. subseriata, since this species was described

Our study revealed extensive morphological variation
within species A and C: a more detailed genetic investigation using a larger number of variable markers
such as microsatellites will be required to find out
whether these variations are due to phenotypic plasticity or to underlying intraspecific genetic differences.
However, phenotypic plasticity is well documented in
Stylophora [30,31,28,29] and is therefore likely to be
responsible for at least part of the observed morphological variations.
The occurrence of the S. mordax morphotype in both
species B and C can hardly be explained by intra-specific
variation alone, but may rather result from phenotypic
convergence (whereby two non-sister species independently evolve similar morphologies) and/or morphological
stasis (whereby the appearance of the common ancestor of
two sister species is passed on to both of them). Since the
sister-species relationship between B and C was very
strongly supported by all molecular markers analyzed,
morphological stasis appears more likely than phenotypic
convergence to explain the similar appearance of species B
and of some morphs of species C.
Even though the data available are not yet sufficient to
pin down completely the causes of the interspecific
morphological similarities and intraspecific phenotypic
variations observed in Stylophora, the observed congruence between nuclear and mitochondrial phylogenies
allows us to reject the hypothesis that hybridization
could be responsible for the discrepancy between morphological and genetic species boundaries in this genus.
This contrasts with previous reports that hybridization
may be rampant in corals (e.g. [39-50]); instead, our
results concur with two recent articles on the closely
related genus Pocillopora [9,11] in suggesting that many
such reports actually result from improper delineation

Flot et al. BMC Ecology 2011, 11:22
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/11/22

of species boundaries and not from actual introgression
between distinct genetic entities.
A new light on the biogeography and biodiversity of
Stylophora in the Indo-Pacific Ocean

Surprisingly, the incongruence between morphological
species delimitations and genetic species boundaries
revealed in our study does not seem to affect the general
picture of the biogeographic distribution of Stylophora
species: with a least three species in the westernmost
part of its area of occurrence versus a single one so far
in the “Coral Triangle”, Stylophora stands confirmed as
a blatant exception to the usual biodiversity pattern
observed in tropical marine invertebrates. The mitochondrial and ITS2 phylogenies of Stylophora comprise
only species A, B and C and do not contradict the
topology of the more complete (but less resolved) ITS1
phylogeny: the sister-group relationship of species B and
C is strongly supported by all markers, whereas the root
of the mitochondrial and ITS1 phylogenies fall between
species A (from Madagascar) and species B and C
(respectively from Madagascar and from the Pacific
Ocean). Even though the sister-group of species D could
not be determined unambiguously due to the current
lack of mitochondrial and ITS2 sequences for this species, the position of the root in our molecular phylogenies suggests that the center of origin of Stylophora is
located in the western Indian Ocean. This hypothesis
will need to be confirmed by analyzing more samples
from key locations in the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden and
the Indian Ocean, but would explain well the unusual
concentration of the biodiversity of this genus in the
westernmost part of his area of distribution.
While waiting for a global taxonomic revision of the
genus Stylophora, for the sake of taxonomic stability we
recommend that the preliminary results presented here
not be translated yet into nomenclature, but that each
genetically delimited species be provisionally designated
by a letter (i.e., “Stylophora sp. A”, “Stylophora sp. B”,
“Stylophora sp. C” and “Stylophora sp. D”). It is only
when a complete picture of the species boundaries of
Stylophora over its whole area of distribution becomes
available that names will be reliably assigned to each
species: for instance, even though the name S. madagascarensis appears suitable for species A given its morphological traits and the location where it was collected, this
species may very well have been described first under
another name in a different location, in which case S.
madagascarensis would become a junior synonym of the
actual name of this species.

Conclusions
Genetic analysis of the coral genus Stylophora reveals
species boundaries that are not congruent with

Page 10 of 14

morphology. Of the four hypotheses capable of explaining such discrepancy (phenotypic plasticity, morphological stasis, morphological convergence, and interspecific
hybridization), the first two seem likely to play a role
but the fourth one is rejected since mitochondrial and
nuclear markers yield congruent species delimitations.
The center of origin of Stylophora appears to be located
in the Indian Ocean, which probably explains why this
genus presents a higher biodiversity in the westernmost
part of its area of distribution than in the “Coral
Triangle”.

Methods
Sample collection and processing

Fragments from 70 Stylophora coral colonies were collected while scuba diving or snorkeling on reefs of New
Caledonia, Okinawa (Japan), Bolinao (Philippines) and
Toliara (Madagascar) between 2004 and 2007. Each colony sampled was photographed underwater and its
depth recorded (Table 1). Coral tissues were preserved
in a buffered guanidium thiocyanate solution [51,52]
and their DNA purified on an ABI Prism 6100 Nucleic
Acid PrepStation.
PCR amplification and sequencing

Three DNA markers previously developed in the closely
related genus Pocillopora [33] were amplified and
sequenced for each individual: the nuclear ribosomal
intergenic transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2), the mitochondrial
ORF and the putative control region (CR). In addition,
new primers were used to amplify the ITS1 region of a
few selected individuals (Table 2). Amplifications were
performed in 25 μl reaction mixes containing 1x Red Taq
buffer, 264 μM dNTP, 5% DMSO, 0.3 μM PCR primers,
0.3 units Red Taq (Sigma), and 10-50 ng DNA. PCR conditions comprised an initial denaturation step of 60 s at
94°C, followed by 40-50 cycles (30 s denaturation at 94°
C, 30 s annealing at 53°C, 75 s elongation at 72°C) and a
final 5-min elongation step at 72°C. PCR products were
sequenced in both directions with the same primers as
for amplification, and chromatograms were assembled
and cleaned using Sequencher 4 (Gene Codes).
Determination of nuclear haplotypes

The ITS2 chromatogram pairs obtained from 43 individuals contained double peaks, indicating that each of
these individuals harbored two sequence types. Finding
out the sequence types was trivial for 5 individuals
whose chromatograms contained only one double peak.
Furthermore, 21 other chromatogram pairs had numerous double peaks, a situation typical of length-variant
heterozygotes [53,54] that allowed direct deconvolution
of their superposed sequences using the program
CHAMPURU [55] (available online at http://www.mnhn.

fr/jfflot/champuru). The remaining 17 chromatograms
pairs had several double peaks (at most 9), as expected
from heterozygotes with no intra-individual length variation: we first attempted to resolve their haplotypes statistically by reference to the rest of the dataset using
SeqPHASE [56] (available online at http://www.mnhn.fr/
jfflot/seqphase) and PHASE [57], but only 7 individuals
were phased unambiguously, i.e., with posterior probabilities equal or nearly equal to 1 (04NC064, 04NC182,
04NC251, 04NC282, 04NC324, 04NC436, 07Mad087).
Among the 10 remaining heterozygotes, the haplotypes

of 2 individuals (07Mad151, 07Mad189) were deduced
directly from their chromatograms thanks to clear-cut
differences in peak sizes (reflecting either differences in
copy number in ribosomal DNA arrays or differential
amplification during PCR), and the sequences of the 8
others (04NC024, 04NC132, 04NC365, 04NC379,
07Mad073, 07Mad074, 07Mad088, 07Mad157) were
inferred using Clark’s method [58]. Length-variant heterozygosity was also observed in the ITS1 chromatograms of five individuals, all of which were resolved
using CHAMPURU.

Phylogenetic analyses and haploweb construction

All haplotype sequences were deposited in public databases [GenBank: JN558840-JN559111]. ORF sequences
were aligned in MEGA5 [59] by taking advantage of
the high degree of conservation of their aminoacid
translations: all sequences from Stylophora were first
aligned by hand as there were only few indels, before
aligning them with outgroup sequences from Pocillopora and Seriatopora using the MEGA5 implementation of MUSCLE [60]. CR, ITS1 and ITS2 sequences
were aligned using MAFFT’s Q-INS-I option [61,62].
Since the two mitochondrial markers ORF and CR
yielded congruent phylogenies, they were concatenated
and only the result of the combined analysis is presented here. The best suited nucleotide model among
88 possible ones was determined for each dataset following the Bayesian Information Criterion [63] as
implemented in jModelTest [64], and used to perform
maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analyses in PhyML
[65] with 1000 bootstrap replicates [66]. Additional
bootstrap analyses (1000 replicates) using neighborjoining (K2P model, pairwise deletion) and parsimony
(dataset collapsed using FaBox [67], complete deletion)
were conducted in MEGA5. The Newick format haplotype trees ("haplotrees”) produced by PhyML were
converted into enhanced metafiles (emf) using the program FigTree 1.3.1 (available online at http://tree.bio.
ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/), then imported in Microsoft
PowerPoint. The ITS2 haploweb was obtained from
the corresponding haplotree by drawing connections
between haplotypes found co-occurring in heterozygous individuals [9].
