Abstract
Background: Specific binding of proteins to DNA is one of the most common ways gene
expression is controlled. Although general rules for the DNA-protein recognition can be derived,
the ambiguous and complex nature of this mechanism precludes a simple recognition code,
therefore the prediction of DNA target sequences is not straightforward. DNA-protein
interactions can be studied using computational methods which can complement the current
experimental methods and offer some advantages. In the present work we use physical effective
potentials to evaluate the DNA-protein binding affinities for the λ repressor-DNA complex for
which structural and thermodynamic experimental data are available.
Results: The binding free energy of two molecules can be expressed as the sum of an
intermolecular energy (evaluated using a molecular mechanics forcefield), a solvation free energy
term and an entropic term. Different solvation models are used including distance dependent
dielectric constants, solvent accessible surface tension models and the Generalized Born model.
The effect of conformational sampling by Molecular Dynamics simulations on the computed binding
energy is assessed; results show that this effect is in general negative and the reproducibility of the
experimental values decreases with the increase of simulation time considered. The free energy of
binding for non-specific complexes, estimated using the best energetic model, agrees with earlier
theoretical suggestions. As a results of these analyses, we propose a protocol for the prediction of
DNA-binding target sequences. The possibility of searching regulatory elements within the
bacteriophage λ genome using this protocol is explored. Our analysis shows good prediction
capabilities, even in absence of any thermodynamic data and information on the naturally
recognized sequence.
Conclusion: This study supports the conclusion that physics-based methods can offer a
completely complementary methodology to sequence-based methods for the identification of
DNA-binding protein target sequences.

Background
Protein-DNA recognition plays an essential role in the regulation of gene expression. Although a significant number
of structures of DNA binding proteins have been solved in
complex with their DNA binding sites increasing our
understanding of recognition principles, most of the questions remain unanswered. Several studies showed that
protein-DNA recognition could not be explained by a
simple one-to-one correspondence between amino acids
and bases [1-3], even if hypothesized hydrogen bonding
patterns and definite preferences have been actually found
in experimentally solved structures [1]. Moreover regulatory proteins are known to recognize specific DNA
sequences directly through atomic contacts between protein and DNA and/or indirectly through water-mediated
contacts and conformational changes [1,4,5]. The degree
of redundancy and flexibility seems to suggest that the recognition mechanism is ambiguous, therefore the prediction of DNA target sequences is not straightforward [6].
DNA protein interactions can be studied using several different computational methods, which could offer several
advantages compared to the current experimental methods, more laborious and slow. In the following we will
indicate, for simplicity, DNA-binding protein target
sequences with the more specific term "transcription factor binding sequences", although the first term is more
general.
Computational tools for the identification of Transcription Factors (TF) binding sequences can be organized in
two main approaches:
• "sequence based methods" in which a central role is
played by the statistical properties of the base distribution
in the DNA regions which are expected to be involved in
transcriptional regulation (see [7,8] for a general review
on the subject).
• "structure based tools" which use the structural information on protein-DNA complexes derived from X-ray crystallography and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance.
The main focus of this paper is on the second approach,
although the best results will likely be obtained by tools
able to combine in a clever way these two approaches.
Sequence based methods
This type of algorithms can in turn be divided into two
broad groups:

i) enumerative methods, which explore all possible motifs
up to a certain length (see e.g. [9-16]).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/7/61

ii) local search algorithms, including expectation maximization and various flavours of Gibbs sampling (see e.g.
[17-20]).
It is important to stress that this type of studies cannot be
based exclusively on the statistical features of the DNA
regions presumably involved in transcriptional regulation, but must be complemented with independent information about gene regulation. In this respect three
important sources of information may be used: the functional annotations collected in public databases, gene
expression data on a global scale, and the so called 'phylogenetic footprinting'. In particular this last approach,
thanks to the increasing number of sequenced genomes,
has proved to be very effective in these last few years (see
e.g. [21-30]). The major problem of all these tools is the
large number of false positives, above all in the case of
higher eukaryotes (for a thorough analysis of this problem
see the interesting assessment of TF binding sites discovery tools reported in [31]). It is exactly to cope with this
type of problem that it could be important to resort to
structure based approaches.
Structure based methods
These methods can be broadly divided into two classes
according to a nomenclature adopted in the context of
protein structure prediction [32]:

i) those based on knowledge based potentials (mostly statistical effective energy functions, SEEFs);
ii) those based on physical potentials (or physical effective energy functions, PEEFs).
SEEFs are energy functions derived from a dataset of
known protein-DNA structures. A set of features is
selected (e.g. nucleotide-amino acid contacts, roll angles
for DNA bases, interatomic distances, etc.); the process
often involves parameter choices, like threshold on distances or interval binning. The statistical properties of
these features are compared with a-priori expectations and
log-odd scores are derived [6,33-38]. At the most basic
level, structures may be used to define contacts among
DNA bases and protein amino acids and, for each pair of
positions, the occurrences of nucleotides and amino acids
contacts are used to derive effective potentials [36]. Moreover a statistical potential, taking into account contact
geometry and spatial arrangement of contacting residues
can be derived [6]. Recently interesting developments of
this approach have been proposed ([38,35,5,39]). The
approach suffers from theoretical and practical problems.
From the theoretical point of view potentials of mean
force are not in general additive and the exact modelization of a-priori expectations (or so-called reference state)
may be difficult for complex systems (see e.g. [40]). The

Page 2 of 24

BMC Structural Biology 2007, 7:61

main practical problem is the requirement of a large
number of sequences or binding experimental data since
the available data may be biased towards specific classes
of protein-DNA complexes. Moreover datasets generally
do not contain unfavourable interactions between amino
acids and bases since they entail protein-DNA complexes
that occur naturally. Thus the statistical potential may predict correctly the wild type targets as opposed to incorrect
ones, but it may not be as good at distinguishing among
mutants.
Notwithstanding all caveats usage of SEEFs are widespread in the field of structural predictions. Provided that
sufficient data are available these methods are reasonably
fast and accurate, as demonstrated for instance in the field
of protein structure prediction (see e.g [41]).
A more radical approach is to estimate the free energy of
binding starting directly from the available (or homology
built) protein-DNA complexes using physical effective
energy functions (PEEFs). This approach has been successfully used in many contexts, ranging from estimation of
DNA- or protein-ligand binding free energy to estimation
of protein-DNA binding free energy (see e.g. [42,43]).
There are, however, many problems connected with the
approach which are mainly due to:
i) difficulties in estimating entropic effects;
ii) difficulties in properly estimating solvation effects;
No consensus has emerged on the choice of parameters
(e.g. inner dielectric constant, surface tension coefficient,
forcefield parameters) and on the protocols that should
be applied;
iii) difficulties in estimating gas-phase energy with available forcefields which are derived from the analysis of
small compounds at equilibrium and do not take into
account electrostatic polarization.
In order to get rid as far as possible of all these problems,
binding free energies are expressed relative to a reference
system and in most computational studies optimal
parameters have been chosen for matching experimental
data.
As far as protein-DNA complexes are concerned attempts
to compute binding free energies using physics based
approaches have started in the 1990s. The electrostatic
component of the binding free energy has been studied
according to continuum methods and its dependence on
temperature and salt concentration has been computed
[44-46]. Integration of electrostatics with other components including DNA conformational free energy has

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/7/61

been extended from DNA-ligand complexes [47] and protein-peptide complexes [48] to protein-DNA complexes
[49]. Recently Wojciechowski et al. [50] studied the complex of telomerase end binding protein with single
stranded DNA optimizing the weights of different contributions in order to reproduce binding data. The availability of the successful analytical generalized Born model
treatment of electrostatics solvation effects enabled computation of binding energies with hybrid molecular
mechanics/Generalized Born surface accessibility methods by Jayaram et al. [51]. The group of Kollman developed the molecular mechanics/Poisson Boltzmann
surface accessibility (MM/PBSA) methodology and
applied it extensively to biomolecular systems (see for a
review of these applications [42,43] and [42,43,43,52] for
important extensions of these ideas).
However, when MM/GBSA or MM/PBSA energy versus
time plots are presented for explicit solvent molecular
dynamics simulation snapshots, fluctuations in the range
of tens to hundreds of kcal/mol are found, thus posing an
issue on the reliability of averages. In this respect SEEFs
appear much more robust energy estimation methods.
In a few very recent reports interesting results have been
reported concerning the capability of hybrid methods to
predict protein-DNA binding sites [53-57]. In this paper
we focus on the application of PEEFs to a single DNA
binding protein in complex with many different DNA
sequences.
The availability of high resolution X-ray crystal structure
[58] and suitable experimental data makes the λ repressor-operator complex an interesting system for computational analysis of protein-DNA interaction. The
bacteriophage λ repressor protein is a small, 92 amino
acid, protein that binds the DNA as a dimer. Each monomer binds to an operator half site. The amino-terminal
domain of λ repressor is responsible for DNA binding and
the carboxy-terminal domain is primarily responsible for
dimerization [59]. Each monomer contains a typical
helix-turn-helix motif found in a variety of DNA binding
proteins [4,60]. The free energy of binding of λ repressor
for wild-type OR1 operator DNA and of all possible single
base-pair substitutions within the operator have been
experimentally measured using the filter binding assay
technique and changes in the free energy of binding
caused by the mutations have been determined [61].
Besides being a perfect playground to test our methods,
the so called "λ-switch" in which the λ repressor is
involved is very interesting in itself (for a review see [62]).
This "genetic" switch is tightly regulated by the λ repressor
and the Cro proteins. In these last years this system, due to
its relative simplicity and to the availability of rather precise experimental data attracted a lot of interest and vari-

ous models (see for instance [63-65] and references
therein) have been proposed to describe its behaviour.
Despite these efforts in all these models there are still a
few open problems which need to be understood. In particular it has been recently realized that in order to ensure
the remarkable stability of the λ switch one should require
a very high non-specific affinity both for the λ repressor
and for Cro [65,66]. Such a prediction is very difficult to
test experimentally but could rather directly be evaluated
with the tools which we shall discuss in this paper. In fact
one of the main goal of the test which we shall perform on
the λ repressor will be the evaluation of its non-specific
binding energy and the comparison with the prediction of
the model discussed in [66].
In the present work we apply different techniques to evaluate the binding affinities by means of computational
methods. It is assumed that the relative free energy of
binding of a protein to different DNA sequences may be
expressed as the sum of a molecular mechanical term, that
includes the non-bonded electrostatic and Van der Waals
contributions, and a hydration term that can be further
split in a polar and a hydrophobic contribution. Due to
the peculiar nature of hydrogen bonds similar alternative
models are tested where an energy term proportional to
the number of hydrogen bonds is added.
The systems studied here differ only in one or two basepairs and therefore the inaccuracies implicit in the
assumption of rigid docking, of the solvation model, of
the treatment of entropy and in lack of a complete conformational search for side chains at protein-DNA interface
should mostly cancel out in comparison. The aims of this
paper are:
1) to provide an assessment of the accuracy of different
methods and protocols by comparison with experimental
data;
2) to provide a reliable estimate of non-specific binding
energies;
3) to propose a protocol for the prediction of DNA-binding target sequences which makes no use of sequence
information.
To pursue these objectives we make use of extensive computations and address several specific issues. In particular:
i) we estimate optimal weights for different contributions
to DNA-protein binding free energies using different solvation models;

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/7/61

ii) for 52 single base-pair mutants we perform 1 ns molecular dynamics (MD) runs and we assess the effect of MD
on the computed binding energies;
iii) we compute MM/GBSA binding energies for one thousand complexes where the bases of the double stranded
DNA are substituted according to randomly generated
DNA sequences in order to estimate non-specific binding
free energy;
iv) we scan the entire bacteriophage λ genome with the
scoring profiles obtained from free energy computations.
One of the profiles is obtained making use only of the
structural data available for a single molecular complex,
with no sequence information.
The statistical analysis of the results show that computational methods may offer a predictive tool truly complementary to sequence-based identification of DNAbinding protein target sequences. This is particularly
important in view of the emergence of consensus protocols where the independence of the different methods is a
prerequisite.

Results and discussion

Binding free energy changes between the λ repressor
dimer and the DNA operator mutants have been calculated using different methodologies, as described in the
Methods section.
MM/DDDC-OONS

We calculated the binding free energy between the λ
repressor dimer and the DNA operators, after having
energy-minimized every complex using a distance
dependent dielectric constant (1r, 2r, 4r, 8r, respectively,
in order to match subsequent energy evaluation). The
interaction energy between the protein and the DNA,
∆U( r1 ,..., rn ), has been evaluated using four values for ε
(1r, 2r, 4r, 8r) then the solvation term ∆Gsolv has been
determined according to the model of Oobatake et al. [54]
using Eq. 2. The best scaling factors have been determined
(together with the standard deviation computed according to Eq. 9) fitting the set of experimentally measured
protein-DNA binding affinities and are reported in Table
1. The addition of a specific hydrogen bond term reduces
the coefficients of the electrostatic term. The RMSD and
the correlation coefficient r have been computed and a
leave-one-out scheme has been adopted, in order to verify
the performance of the model (Table 2). The same analysis has been performed for 5000 replicas of the dataset
with one third of the set left out and used for cross-validation. The average RMSD and correlation are essentially the

same reported for the leave-one-out scheme reported in
Table 2. From the same analysis variances of the coefficients have been estimated with essentially the same
results as those reported in Table 1.
The best correlation coefficient (r = 0.703 for MM/DDDCOONS(+HB) model) has been obtained for ε = 4r,
although values of ε = 2r and ε = 8r gave very similar
results for both MM/DDDC-OONS and MM/DDDCOONS(+HB) models. Except for the MM/DDDCOONS(+HB) model with ε = 1r, the F-statistic shows that
the model is significant (p < 0.001). The dielectric constant ε = 1r, which gives the worst results tends in many
cases to overestimate binding free energy changes lower
than 1.0 kcal/mol whereas binding free energy changes
greater than 2 kcal/mol are underestimated. A similar
behaviour has been observed for ε = 2r, 4r, 8r, even if these
models are able to better reproduce binding free energy
changes, in particular improvements have been obtained
for values lower than 1.0 kcal/mol (Figure 1). The analysis
of the best scaling coefficients is not straightforward
because there is a strong correlation between the energy

terms. For instance, for all ε models the electrostatic term
is strongly anticorrelated with the OONS solvation term.
Moreover the estimated variance of coefficients is often
very large. Notwithstanding these difficulties it is worth
noting that some terms appear to be particularly important. For instance each protein-DNA hydrogen bond
(when explicitly included in the model) appears to contribute -0.15 to -0.27 kcal/mol, depending on the electrostatic model assumed.
As expected the electrostatic term is reduced when hydrogen bonds are taken into account separately. For ε = 2r the
best scaling coefficient xDDDC changes from 0.154 to 0.182
upon removal of the term proportional to the number of
hydrogen bonds.
The correlation between the different contributions is
reflected in the changes, with changing dielectric model,
of the OONS term scaling factor, which is always strongly
reduced by the scaling factor ranging from 0.075 to 0.066. Finally the constant term which takes into account

common entropic terms (which can be estimated to be in
the range 20 to 40 kcal/mol) and the free energy of binding of the reference complex (which implies the addition
of 11.3 kcal/mol), expected to be in the range of 30 to 50
kcal/mol, is slightly larger than expected.
MM/DDDC-HP
The OONS solvation term is accounting for both apolar
and electrostatic solvation terms which should be already
taken into account, at least partly, in the distance dependent dielectric constant. The same calculations described
above have been performed using a similar approach in

which the solvation term of the binding free energy is
taken to be proportional to the polar/apolar accessible
surface area of the molecule (see Eq. 6). The best scaling
factors have been determined fitting the set of experimentally measured protein-DNA binding affinities (Table 1).
The quality of the computed binding free energies ∆Gcalc
has been assessed evaluating the linear correlation coefficient r and the root mean square deviation (RMSD)
between calculated and experimental values. In order to
verify the performance of the model, a leave-one-out
scheme has been adopted (Table 2). The F-statistic shows
that the model is significant (p < 0.001).

Computed binding free energies (MM/DDDC-HP(+HB)
model) versus experimental measurements, using a distance
dependent dielectric constant (ε = 1r, 2r, 4r, 8r). The correlation coefficients between calculated and experimental values
are 0.684, 0.745, 0.728 and 0.739 for ε = 1r, 2r, 4r, 8r, respectively.

All the values of the distance dependent dielectric constant which have been tested gave a quite high and similar
linear correlation coefficient. The highest correlation
value (r = 0.745) was obtained for ε = 2r for the MM/
GBSA(+HB) model and the lowest ones for ε = 1r similar
to the MM/DDDC-OONS model. Generally, binding free
energy changes lower than 1.0 kcal/mol are overestimated
whereas binding free energy changes greater than 2 kcal/
mol are underestimated in all the cases. More accurate
predictions have been obtained for ε = 2r, in particular for
values lower than 1.0 kcal/mol (Figure 2).

These results support the conclusion that, in general, there
is no advantage in using the detailed solvation models
compared to the simpler polar/apolar model, as far as the
binding free energy is concerned. Based on the range of
the scaling coefficients the two models appear of similar
quality. Scaled free energy components for the MM/
DDDC-HP(+HB) model are reported in Table 3.

The optimal scaling coefficients are in the expected range
(Table 1), in particular for ε = 2r, 4r, 8r the constant term
xconst is in the range 10–20 kcal/mol, moreover the coefficients xH and xP have the right order of magnitude of typically used surface tension coefficients for water
biomolecular interface, even if the sign is incorrect. It
should be noted however that there is a strong correlation
(ranging in this case from 0.2 to 0.6) between the coefficients of most terms and the coefficient of the constant
term.
Also for the present model the addition of an explicit
hydrogen bond term reduces the coefficient of the electrostatic term as could be expected.

MM/GBSA
In this approach all structures have been energy-minimized using the Generalized Born solvent model, then the
binding free energy for every molecule has been calculated
according to the MM/GBSA model using the Eq. 7. As in
the previous cases, we determined the best scaling factors
(and standard deviations according to Eq. 9) fitting the set
of experimentally measured protein-DNA binding affinities (Table 4), then we assessed the quality of ∆Gcalc predictions evaluating the linear correlation coefficient r and the
root mean square deviation (RMSD) between calculated
and experimental values. Finally we verified the performance of the model, using the leave-one-out scheme (Table
2). The same analysis has been performed for 5000 replicas of the dataset with one third of the set left out and used
for cross-validation. The average RMSD and correlation
are essentially the same reported for the leave-one-out
scheme reported in Table 2. The standard deviations of
the coefficients are essentially the same as reported in

The constant term is -11.7 kcal/mol, lower than what
expected, probably as a consequence of the correlation of
this term with the polar and hydrophobic surface area
terms (the linear correlations of the coefficients are 0.51
and 0.75, respectively). The standard deviation of this
term is however very large (28.0 kcal/mol).
Scaled free energy components for the MM/GBSA(+HB)
model are reported in Table 5.
The analysis of Table 5 shows that the most important feature for computing the binding free energy is the number
of intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The correlation of the
associated energy term with the experimental free energy
of binding is 0.58. Other terms are strongly correlated
among each other and therefore it is difficult to single out
specific contributions. The correlation between different

energetic terms range from -0.99, for GB solvation energy
and Coulombic energy, to 0.44, for GB solvation energy
and polar area burial energy term.

sus experimental data are reported in Figure 3. As far as the
scaling coefficients are concerned (see Table 4), it is worth
noting that addition of an explicit hydrogen bond term
has a dramatic effect on the coefficients of van der Waals
and electrostatic terms, as could be expected, because the
latter terms already take into account hydrogen bond
energetics. For the MM/GBSA model (with no explicit
term for hydrogen bonds) the coefficients of the electrostatic and GB solvation terms are 0.16 and 0.14 which correspond to a dielectric constant of ~6. Surface tension
coefficients xP and xH (-0.010 and -0.029 respectively)
have the same order of magnitude of the commonly used
surface tension coefficient (ca 0.02 kcal/mol Å-2), but
opposite sign. However the terms proportional to the solvent accessible surface area are strongly correlated to each
other and to the constant term.

Waals terms. It should be noted, however, that solvation
terms are correlated with Coulombic and van der Waals
terms.
This analysis is in general in line with the detailed analysis
reported by Oobatake et al. [54], although the exact values
of energy contributions differ.
Analysis of molecular dynamics trajectories
The procedure used for computing binding energies may
suffer from incomplete relaxation and incomplete conformational sampling. An approach that has been used in the
past for sampling more conformations and reduce the
effect of fluctuations is to analyse snapshots from molecular dynamics runs. In many studies no scaling factor was
applied at all, with good results.

We performed 1 ns of MD simulations for every structure
in order to test the effectiveness of a first principles computation of binding free energies and to check the effect of
molecular dynamics relaxation on the computed energies.
We calculated the average value of every component of the
binding free energy using snapshots taken every 50 ps,
then we used the same set of fitting equations using average values to determine the best scaling factors. We chose
to use the MM/GBSA(+HB) model for computing binding
free energies because it gave good results on the starting
structures and the coefficients can be used to monitor the
quality of the fitting. Figure 3 The quality of the computed
binding free energies ∆Gcalc has been assessed evaluating
the linear correlation coefficient r and the root mean
square deviation (RMSD) between calculated and experimental values (see Table 6). Results show that MD simulations do not improve the prediction capabilities of the
model. Actually the linear correlation coefficient calculated averaging over 1.0 ns is 0.356, much lower than the
correlation at t = 0.0 ns. Results obtained averaging over
the time interval 0.0–0.5 ns, gave a linear correlation coefficient comparable to what obtained with other models
on the starting structures (r = 0.534) but lower than the
linear correlation coefficient obtained at t = 0.0 ns. The
linear correlation coefficient between experimental values
and the results obtained averaging over the time interval

of any correlation.
Moreover optimal scaling factors obtained averaging over
the time interval 0.5–1.0 ns have the tendency to lose any
physical meaning (Table 7). When optimal scaling factors
obtained on the starting structure are used to compute
binding free energies using average values, no correlation
is detectable with experimental data. The value of the
binding free energy change of every complex across 1 ns of
simulation has been observed to strongly fluctuate, making it difficult to obtain an accurate estimate of it.
In order to verify whether this problem could have been
circumvented using a larger conformational sampling, the
simulations of 10 mutants have been extended to 4 ns,
obtaining a total of 400 snapshots for every simulation. In
particular we extended the simulations of the wild type
complex and the best and the worst mutants (G17-C25
and T14-A28 respectively) with negative results. Although
the system is most probably not fully equilibrated, it is
reasonable to suspect that even longer (in the range of few
tens ns) molecular dynamics simulations will not
improve the results obtainable on the starting structures.
The main reasons of failure of this approach are probably
the large conformational fluctuations developing in MD
simulations and the combination of relatively short
molecular dynamics simulations with snapshots energy
evaluation using the MM/GBSA(+HB) continuum model.
Large conformational fluctuations observed in MD simulations are reflected in energetic fluctuations in the range
of tens of kcal/mol, thus posing an issue on the reliability
of the free energy average values. Moreover, since we
observed that the results could not be improved extending
the simulation time, it is reasonable to ascribe the failure
of the method, at least partially, to inaccuracies in the
force field parametrization. Actually, all force fields are
based on numerous approximations, in particular nucleic
acid force fields could suffer from two main problems
which could give rise to inaccuracies. The first is that the
target experimental data used in the optimization process

are typically crystal structures of DNA and RNA. However,
the presence of the lattice environment in crystals is
known to influence the structure of DNA, limiting the
transferability of crystal data to solution. The second is the
treatment of electrostatics which is crucial in these simulations, given the polyanionic nature of DNA. In particular, the electrostatic polarization, which is an effect that
can significantly reduce electrostatic interactions of partial
atomic charges, is very important for accurate treatment of
interactions in different environments, since significant
structural changes of DNA may occur in response to environment.

procedure is applied to the coefficients the number of correct predictions can be increased by several units. It is
instructive for instance to consider the MM/GBSA(+HB)
model, where 41 "correct" predictions can be achieved
with minor (mostly less than 10%) variations relative to
the starting values of coefficients. From this qualitative
point of view, the prediction capabilities of the different
models can be compared. The best performing models
appear to be the MM/DDDC-HP model with ε = 2r. On
average the DDDC-HP model performs better than the
similar DDDC-OONS model. For ε = 1r results are worst
than for higher ε values.

Correct predictions
Table 8 shows the number of correct predictions, according to the criteria described in the Methods section. In the
last column the number of cases in which the difference D
= |∆Gexp - ∆Gcalc| is lower than 0.3 kcal/mol, that is the
number of the more accurate predictions, has been
reported. It should be noted that the fitting of coefficients
aims at minimizing the RMSD between calculated and
experimental values and not at maximizing the number of
"correct" predictions. When a simple simulated annealing

Molecular dynamics trajectories were analysed similarly,
using average values for the different contributions to the
free energy of binding. In particular the lowest number of
correct predictions has been obtained averaging over the
time interval 0.5–1.0 ns, actually there is no cases in
which both ∆Gexp and ∆Gcalc are <1.0 kcal/mol and the
number of cases in which ∆Gexp and ∆Gcalc are separated by
less than 0.3 kcal/mol has been strongly reduced.

Generally, we observed that the number of cases in which
∆Gexp and ∆Gcalc are both <1.0 kcal/mol decreases while
the number of cases in which ∆Gexp and ∆Gcalc are both >
1.0 kcal/mol remains nearly constant; however at the
same time the number of cases in which ∆Gexp and ∆Gcalc
are separated by less than 0.3 kcal/mol strongly decreases,
indicating that there is a reduction of the accuracy in
reproducing experimental binding energies. Overall this
analysis is consistent with the analyses reported in the previous sections.
Validation of the MM/GBSA model using the Cro-OR1
complex
The optimal scaling coefficients are likely to depend on
the complex and mutants studied. In order to verify that
such coefficients do not produce wild results when
applied on different complexes with similar binding features we considered the Cro OR1 complexes which was
obtained from crystallographic structure (PDB id. code:
6CRO) after mutation of 14 bases. The Cro protein
belongs to the same family of λ repressor but to a different
domain, according to SCOP classification [67] and it has
very limited similarity with λ repressor although they
bind DNA in a similar fashion. This system is therefore
suited for testing the overall quality of the scaling procedure. Also for Cro a set of measurements for each mutant
of the OR1 sequence is available [68]. When all contributions to the binding free energy, computed according to
the MM/GBSA(+HB) model, are scaled by the coefficients
determined on the λ repressor complexes the computed
energies show a remarkable correlation coefficient of 0.62
with the experimental values, although the binding energies are overestimated by approximately 10 kcal/mol. This
fact could reflect differences in the entropic contribution
to binding (arising from restriction in side chain and
backbone mobility) that are likely to be different for the
two systems. Indeed, the crystallized Cro protein is
roughly only two thirds of the repressor sequence. Notwithstanding the differences in overall binding energy, the
binding differences for the mutants are on average reproduced by the energetic model.

As a further test, we performed the reverse analysis where
the scaling coefficients are obtained on the Cro-OR1 complex and validated on the λ repressor-operator complex.
Also in this case the computed energies show a remarkable correlation coefficient of 0.69 with the experimental
values, although they are all underestimated by approximately 16 kcal/mol.
In order to verify how sensitive the scaling coefficients are
to the experimental data used in the fit, we calculated the
binding free energies of Cro and each mutant of the OR1
sequence according to the MM/GBSA model, using Eq. 7.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/7/61

Finally we combined the two experimental datasets of λ
repressor and Cro and we refitted the model.
As in the previous cases, we calculated the best scaling factors fitting the set of experimentally measured proteinDNA binding affinities (Table 4), then we assessed the
quality of ∆Gcalc predictions evaluating the linear correlation coefficient r and the root mean square deviation
between calculated and experimental values. Finally we
verified the performance of the model, using the leaveone-out scheme. The best performance has been obtained
for the MM/GBSA(+HB) model, which gives a correlation
coefficient r of 0.69 and a rmsd of 0.74 for Cro and a correlation coefficient r of 0.67 and a rmsd of 0.83 for the
two combined systems. The same analysis has been performed for 5000 replicas of the dataset with one third of
the set left out and used for cross-validation. The average
RMSD and correlation are essentially the same reported
for the leave-one-out scheme. From the same analysis variances of the coefficients have been estimated with essentially the same results as those reported in Table 4. As far
as the scaling coefficients are concerned (see Table 4), by
comparing the results obtained for λ, Cro and the two
combined systems, we can observe that the sets of values
obtained for λ and λ + Cro are all in the same range except
for the constant term, probably as a consequence of the
fact that the entropic contribution to binding are likely
different for the two systems. However it is worth noting
that the standard deviation of this term is very large in
both cases. As far as the scaling coefficients obtained for
Cro, they are rather different from the others, except for
xvdw and xHB, which scale the Van der Waals and H-bonds
contributions respectively. However we observed that the
electrostatic and GB solvation terms are strongly correlated to each other (the linear correlation coefficient is
0.998), as well as the constant term and the polar and
hydrophobic surface area terms (the linear correlation of
the coefficients is 0.645 and 0.784). The standard deviation of the constant term is also very large (see Table 4).
Overall these results validate the approach for predicting
binding free energies for similar protein-DNA complexes.
Analysis of non-specific protein-DNA binding
In order to study non-specific protein-DNA binding one
thousand random DNA sequences have been generated
and each sequence has been threaded onto the DNA phosphate backbone of the crystal structure in order to obtain
a set of structural models with new DNA sequences. Minimization was performed according to the protocol
described in the Methods section. We refer to to this set of
complexes as to the "non-specific" set.

Binding free energies for each member of the generated
non-specific set have been computed according to the
MM/GBSA(+HB) model, using the optimal scaling factors

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/7/61

determined by fitting the 52 experimental data (see Table
4).
We calculated the Z-scores of both the random structures
and the single base-pair mutants, i.e. the distribution of
the difference between the binding free energy of a complex and the average energy of the non-specific set, normalized by the standard deviation of the computed
energies. Z-scores represent the specificity of a complex,
with larger negative values corresponding to higher specificity. Figure 4 shows the distribution of computed energies. The distribution of the Z-scores of the single basepair mutant complexes, is found at the negative tail of the
non-specific distribution, indicating that these complexes
are more stable than the complexes formed with a DNA
random sequence, as one expects. The computed energies
have an average difference of 4.8 kcal/mol and a standard
deviation of 2.2 kcal/mol, giving thus an average z-score
for the single base-pair mutants of 2.14 and 2.87 for the
lowest computed energy in the set. The average non-specific binding energy seems surprisingly low (meaning that
it implies that a rather large fraction of λ repressors
present in the cell is actually non-specifically bound to
DNA) but, remarkably enough, it agrees within the errors
with the value proposed in [66] as a way to explain the
impressive stability of the λ-switch.

Distributions of the calculated binding free energy (bin width
= 1 kcal/mol) for the "non-specific" set (dotted line) and for
the single base-pair mutants (continuous line). The distributions are normalized to the same total number of counts.

In particular we aim at verifying:
It is interesting to compare the computed free energies of
binding for the non-specific DNA complexes with those
expected based on single mutants binding energies under
the assumption of additivity. The expected free energies
are higher than those computed by optimal scaling of
contributions. The average difference, with respect to the
specifically bound sequence, are 18.4 kcal/mol and 6.1
kcal/mol, respectively. This has been interpreted as a consequence of the fact that adjacent multiple substitutions
may introduce additional energy minima compared to
single mutations in a tight complex. This result is in line
with the saturation effect in observed vs. predicted binding energy that has been described by Stormo and coworkers [69,70] and recently experimentally demonstrated [71]. It is also interesting to note that the non-specific binding energy is comparable to the energy
computed by Northrup and co-workers for loosely docked
complex of Cro to non-cognate DNA [72], which implies
that the mode of binding may substantially change for
non-specifically bound DNA sequences. This would be
consistent with the capability of the protein of sliding
along DNA, which would not be feasible for a tight complex.
Identification of putative transcription factor binding sites
The aim of this section is to understand whether the methods described here can be used for searching genomes for
candidate transcription factor binding sites.

i) whether the MM/GBSA(+HB) model is able to identify
transcription factor binding sites in the absence of thermodynamic data about single base-pair mutants, but just
knowing the recognized sequence;
ii) whether some predictions can still be afforded in the
absence of thermodynamic data and of any information
on recognized sequences. The latter situation could be
encountered when a model of the complex is built by
homology and differences in protein DNA-contacting residues imply a different specificity.
Identification of putative transcription factor binding sites knowing
the bound sequence
The analysis in the previous section used knowledge
about single base-pair mutants which is rarely available.
Here we ask what predictions can be made when no thermodynamic data on mutants or wild-type sequence binding is available, but the cognate sequence is available. One
thousand random DNA sequences were generated and the
corresponding structural models were built by performing
mutations on the double stranded DNA in the complex
crystal structure using the program WHATIF [73]. Structures were energy minimized using the same protocol
used for the MM/GBSA(+HB) methodology. Assuming
that random sequences will have a larger free energy of
binding compared to the bound sequence, optimal scal-

ing parameters were sought in order to make the free
energy difference in binding with respect to the naturally
occurring complex equal to 10.0 kcal/mol. This value is
arbitrary, albeit not unrealistic. Eq. 7 is solved (in a least
square sense) subtracting the row corresponding to the
wild-type complex from all other rows, and fixing all the
energy differences equal 10.0. The differences in Coulombic, van der Waals, GB solvation energy, polar and apolar
surface area and number of hydrogen bonds, with respect
to wild-type complex, have been tabulated and the optimal scaling parameters have been determined.
The free energies computed on the random sequences
have been used to compute single base-pair mutant free
energies as described in the Methods section. The single
base-pair mutant energies for the wild type sequence have
been reset to 0.0 (this assumes that the specific bound
sequence is known) and the lowest computed single basepair mutant binding energy has been subtracted from all
other values.
The plot of computed single base-pair mutant energies vs.
experimental energies (computed under the hypothesis of
additivity) shows a good correlation (0.58) but seems
insufficient for predictive purposes. However, when the
bacteriophage λ genome is scanned using the corresponding free energy matrix (see Methods), high-affinity binding sites are correctly recognized, and in general the
energies computed using the matrix and those predicted
based on addition of single base-pair mutation effects are
well correlated (corr. coeff. 0.74).
We asked what is the advantage of such computation
compared to the simpler model that assigns a constant
energy penalty to each mutation over the specific bound
sequence. In such case the correlation between the computed and reference binding energies is slightly lower, but
still significant (0.72). The advantage of using computational results over a much simpler single parameter
approach seems therefore very limited, although the 1%
best sites predicted by the MM/GBSA(+HB) energy and
the simple mutation models display only 15% common
sites, proving that the two methods are largely uncorrelated.
Identification of putative transcription factor binding sites without
knowing the bound sequence
As a last test we simulate a realistic situation in which no
thermodynamic data or information on the recognized
sequences are available. We considered the set of one
thousand random DNA sequences and the corresponding
structural models built by performing mutations on the
double stranded DNA in the complex crystal structure as
the only information available. Obviously the crystallographic complex does contain information on the specific

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/7/61

sequence because protein and DNA conformations are fitting each other in the complex. If non-specific complexes
were to be built by homology without knowing the exact
DNA sequence bound, it is likely that side chains would
be placed differently with different results. Finally, structures were energy minimized using the same protocol
used for the MM/GBSA(+HB) methodology. As in the
tests above we found optimal scaling factors in order to
make all (non-specific) binding free energies equal to
10.0 kcal/mol.
In order to avoid a trivial solution to the fitting problem
with all coefficients equal 0.0 except the constant term
equal 10.0, we follow a two-step procedure. In the first
step we assume a reasonable value (30 kcal/mol) for the
constant term which must be brought to the left-hand side
of Eq. 7. Coulombic, van der Waals, GB solvation energy,
polar and apolar surface area and number of hydrogen
bonds have been evaluated, Eq. 7 is then solved (in a least
square error sense) and the optimal scaling parameters
have been determined. The lowest binding energy
sequence according to the scaling parameters is determined. The row corresponding to this complex is subtracted from all other rows thus removing the constant
term. In the second step the newly obtained matrix, which
does not include the constant term anymore is used to
find the best coefficients to make all the energy differences
equal 10.0 kcal/mol. Therefore all energies are expressed
relative to the lowest computed energy at the first step.
The free energies computed on the random sequences
have been used to compute single base-pair mutant free
energies as described in the Methods section. At variance
with the test performed above we do not set to 0.0 the
energies of specific bound sequence (which is assumed
here to be unknown). The correlation coefficient between
computed and experimental energies (computed under
the assumption of additivity) for the bacteriophage λ
genome is 0.50 (Figure 5).
As a further test of the performance of the approach we
generated the logo [74] of the 10 best binding sequences
according to the thermodynamic data on single base-pair
mutants and those found with the present approach (Figure 6). An overall agreement between the two logos is
apparent.

Conclusion
In the present work physical effective energy functions are
used to estimate the free energy of binding of λ repressor
to the DNA operator and single base-pair mutants, for
which thermodynamic data are available. Thermodynamic data allow one to study the best results achievable,
with the modeling approach and energy functions pre-

sented here, with models that assume that the binding
energy is a linear combination of different contributions.
Simple models that use a distance dependent dielectric
constant and simple terms for surface area proportional
energy contributions and for hydrogen bonding perform
surprisingly well for values of ε ranging from 2r to 8r.
A two-parameter model for surface area proportional
energy contributions performs better than the more complex model of Oobatake et al. [55], which was however
not derived for usage in the more complex energy functions employed here.
The performance of MM/GBSA(+HB) and to a lesser
extent MM/GBSA model is comparable to or superior to
other models. A conclusion for the MM/GBSA model is
that electrostatic energies should be reduced by a proper
scaling factor corresponding to dielectric constants in the
range of 6. This conclusion is reached also by a similar
analysis of protein Cro-operator mutants.
The effect of molecular dynamics on the computed binding free energies is in general negative and the reproducibility of the experimental values decreases with the
increase of simulation time considered. This may be a
consequence of the large fluctuations developing in MD
simulations which probably would require a much longer

simulation time. Moreover it is reasonable to take into
account that the poor performance of the method can be
partially caused by the errors in the force field used in MD
simulations. Another plausible source of inaccuracy is the
mismatch between the energy model and system representation used in MD simulation and those used for minimization and energy evaluation. It appears therefore that
it is worth to invest more time in optimizing the starting
structure, rather than for sampling the conformational
space by molecular dynamics simulations, or, alternatively, to adopt different strategies for sampling protein
and DNA flexibility [75].
The analysis of non-specific complexes using the best performing energetic model with properly scaled coefficients
allows to evaluate a non-specific binding energy difference, with respect to the specific bound sequence, of 6.06
± 2.17 kcal/mol, definitely lower than what expected
based on an additive model (18.1 kcal/mol for the single
base-pair mutants computed energies). This result is in
line with the saturation effect described by Stormo and coworkers [69,70] and with the theoretical analysis of Bakk
and Melzer [66].
Although the results presented on single base-pair
mutants are not exciting, using computational methods

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/7/61

may be very useful for identifying transcription factor
binding sites.
When no thermodynamic data are available but the specific bound sequence is known the computed MM/
GBSA(+HB) free energies are slightly more predictive than
a simple substitution profile which assigns a penalty for
any point mutation.
The most interesting test performed here considers a realistic scenario where no information on the bound
sequence is available. Even in this case MM/GBSA(+HB)
energies are predictive.
This result has important consequences for the prediction
of transcription factor binding sites which often use consensus methods. A prerequisite for the usefulness of consensus methods is that these are as independent of each
other as possible. Since most methods use common prior
knowledge and often related statistical methods, independence is not guaranteed. Methods which are based on
completely independent principles, like those based on
physical effective energy functions and free energy computations, offer a completely complementary methodology for deriving profile matrices for scanning entire
genomes. The results reported here, with much caution
because the structural model for the specific bound
sequence is known and not modeled by homology or
other methods, support usage of these methods for the
identification of DNA-binding protein target sequences.
In view of the very recent impressive results reported by
the group of Baker [76] it is apparent that significant
improvements to the approach described in this paper
may be obtained by extensive refinement and screening of
protein side chain conformation at protein-DNA interface.

Methods
Model building
Atomic coordinates of the λ repressor dimer bound to OL1
DNA operator were taken from the 1.8 Å resolution X-ray
crystal structure deposited in the Protein Data Bank [77]
(PDB code 1LMB). The operator is 17 base-pairs in length
and is composed by two approximately symmetric parts,
the "consensus half" (maintaining the notation of the
PDB file, base-pairs A19-T23 to G11-C31) and the "nonconsensus half" (base-pairs T3-A39 to G10-C32) (see Figure 7). Since the coordinates of the NH2-terminal arm of
the repressor bound to the non-consensus half operator
were not available, the lacking amminoacids were added
using the protein bound to the consensus half operator.
Using the program ProFit V2.2 [78], the Cα carbons of the
proteins have been superimposed and afterward the
amino acids of the rotated structure have been added to
the other one. Since the detailed X-ray crystal structure is

made up of λ repressor dimer and OL1 operator DNA
while the experimental data concern the OR1 site, the
WHATIF [73] program was used to substitute the basepair at position 5 to obtain the wild-type OR1 operator. All
possible single base-pair substitutions within the DNA
sequence were generated using the program WHATIF [73].
Molecular Dynamics Simulations
Hydrogen atoms have been added using the program
pdb2gmx of the GROMACS package [79,80]. Every structure has been optimized performing 200 steps of energy
minimization using the NAMD program, fixing all Cα carbons and phosphate groups coordinates. A dielectric constant of 10 has been employed with a cut-off of 12 Å for
non-bonded interactions.

The net charge of the system (-36) has been neutralized
placing a corresponding number of sodium counterions
in energetically favourable positions. The electrostatic

BMC Structural Biology 2007, 7:61

potential was calculated via numerical solutions of the
Poisson-Boltzmann equation using the University of
Houston Brownian Dynamics (UHBD, version 6.x) program [81,82]. A counterion was placed at the lowest
potential position at 7.0 Å from any heavy atom of the solute. The cycle was repeated until the net charge of the system was 0.
The complex and counterions were solvated in a box of
TIP3P [83] water molecules using the solvate module in
the program VMD [84]. The resulting system contained
about 4200 solute atoms and 50400 solvent atoms. The
coordinates of the solute were fixed and the solvent was
energy minimized using 100 steps of conjugate gradient.
A solvent equilibration was carried out by performing
molecular dynamics for 50 ps using a 1 fs time step to let
the water molecules move to adjust to the conformation
of the solute. The system was then energy minimized
using 100 steps of conjugate gradient and, after 100 ps
equilibration, 1-ns MD simulations was performed using
a 2-fs timestep. A snapshot of the trajectory was stored
every 10 ps for later analysis. The shakeH algorithm was
used in order to fix bond length between each hydrogen
and its mother atom to its nominal value and to extend
the simulation time-step [85]. All molecular dynamics
simulations of the complex were run under constant NPT
conditions using the NAMD program [86]. The pressure
of the system was coupled, through a Berendsen-thermostat [87], to a pressure bath with target pressure 1.01325
bar and time constant 100 fs. The temperature has been
kept to 300 K by simple velocity rescaling every picosecond. Long-range electrostatic interactions were treated by
particle mesh Ewald (PME) method [88] employing a grid
of 128 × 128 × 128 points. The cut-off was 12 Å and the
tolerance was 10-6 which resulted in an Ewald coefficient
of 0.257952. The order for PME interpolation was 4.
The simulations were performed on a cluster composed
by ten dual-processor nodes based on Intel XeonTM 2.8
GHz, with hyper-threading technology.
Free energy calculations
The free energy of binding for each structure has been
computed according to the framework reviewed by Gilson
et al. [89] who derived the expression of the free energy of
binding in terms of the microscopic properties of the two
molecules involved, using standard statistical thermodynamics. Here, similar to other works employing continuum methods several simplifications are adopted. The
free energy of binding for each complex minus the entropic contribution is expressed as the sum of the interaction

energy between the protein and the DNA ∆U( r1 ,..., rn ) and
a solvation free energy term ∆Gsolv :

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/7/61

∆G = ∆U(r1 ,..., rn ) + ∆Gsolv (r1 ,..., rn )

(1)

It has been assumed that the entropy restriction in internal degrees of freedom and overall rotation and translation degrees of freedom is the same for all complexes.
The effect that association has on intramolecular energy
has been neglected. Moreover no extended conformational search has been performed for protein side chains
and DNA, partly because this task is not easily accomplished and partly because large conformational changes
often result in large molecular mechanics energy changes,
so we aimed at keeping the systems to be compared as
close as possible. The free energy of binding has been calculated using different methodologies detailed below. For
all models alternative versions in which an energy term
proportional to the number of hydrogen bonds has been
added have been considered.
Except where noted, all contributions to the free energy of
binding have been optimally scaled in order to best reproduce available experimental data (see later).
MM/DDDC-OONS
In this method [54] electrostatic interactions have been
estimated using a distance dependent dielectric constant
(DDDC) while the solvation energy is proportional to the
solvent accessible surface area through the atomic solvation parameters of Oobatake, Ooi, Nemethy and Scheraga
(OONS) [55].

All structures have been energy minimized with 200 conjugate gradient steps, using a distance-dependent dielectric constant (four values have been tested: 1r, 2r, 4r, 8r,
with the distance r expressed in Å) and a cut-off of 12 Å.
The molecular mechanics interaction energy U( r1 ,..., rn )
was evaluated using CHARMM (version 27b2), a classic
and well-tested molecular mechanics force-field [90,91].
This term includes the nonbonded electrostatic and Van
der Waals contributions. The solvation free energy term
Gsolv has been calculated according to the model developed by Oobatake et al. [54]. This model consists in
assigning every atom to one of 9 classes of chemical
groups and assuming that the hydration free energy of
every group i in a solute is proportional to its solvent
accessible surface area (SASA) Ai because the group can
directly interact only with water molecules at the surface.

have been determined

from thermodynamic data on the transfer of small molecules from the gas phase into aqueous environment
assuming the additivity of contributions from individual
groups [55].
MM/DDDC-HP
In a very similar approach the OONS 9-parameter solvation model has been replaced by a simpler 2-parameter
hydrophobic, polar (HP) solvation model. Energy minimization protocol and tested values are the same as for
the MM/DDDC-OONS for proper comparison.
MM/GBSA
In this method the solvation free energy term is split in a
polar (electrostatic) and a non-polar (hydrophobic) term.

∆Gsolv (r ) = ∆G polar (r ) + ∆Gnon− polar (r )

(3)

The polar term is computed using the Generalized Born
approach [92]. All complexes have been energy minimized by 200 conjugate gradients minimization steps
using the generalized Born model as implemented in the
CHARMM program, then the solute and solvation energy
terms have been computed for both the complex and the
isolated molecules. The binding energy was then computed by subtraction. Doubling the number of minimization steps does not affect significantly the results.
The non-polar term Gnon-polar, which takes into account the
tendency of the non-polar parts of the molecule to collapse, is taken to be proportional to the solvent-accessible
surface area A, i.e. Gnon-polar = γA, where the surface tension
coefficient γ has been empirically determined to be equal
to 20 cal Å -2 mol-1 for this kind of applications [93].
A variant of this methodology including splitting the solvent accessible surface area into a polar and a hydrophobic contribution (i.e. using two different surface tension
coefficients), and including a term proportional to the
number of hydrogen bonds has been considered here.
Finding optimal scaling factors
The choice of methods and parameters in molecular
mechanics/implicit solvent methods is subject to large
uncertainties. In order to explore the best performance
achievable with these methodologies, optimal scaling factors for the different contributions were searched that
could best reproduce the experimental data. This
approach is not new and it has been used successfully by
other groups (see e. g. [57]). In practice it is expected that
proper scaling is able to compensate for the many inaccuracies of the model. In general terms, the free energy of

binding has been computed as a linear combination of
contributions Ei, with corresponding coefficients xi, i.e.:

∆Gbinding = ∑ xi ∆Ei

(4)

i

where ∆ represents the difference between the complex
and the isolated protein and DNA molecules. Coefficients
x1,...,xn have been found in order to best reproduce the 52
experimentally available free energies of binding. Contributions have been arranged in a 52 × n matrix A where
each row corresponds to each structural model and each
column corresponds to a different contribution to the free
energy of binding. The experimental binding free energies
have been arranged in a 52-component vector ∆Gexptl. The
linear system
Ax = ∆Gexptl
where x is the n-component vector of coefficients, has
been solved (in a least square sense) using singular value
decomposition [94] and the best xi coefficients have been
used to calculate binding energies ∆Gcalc. A constant term
takes into account the entropy loss upon complexation
and other possible contributions identical for all complexes.
A linear model, compared to more sophisticated methods, has the advantage that the number of adjustable
parameters is limited and easily interpretable in physical
terms.
In the following we detail the contributions considered
for each energetic model.
The free energy of binding has been computed for the
MM/DDDC-OONS model according to the following
equation:
∆GMM/DDDC-OONS = xvdW∆EvdW + xDDDC∆Eelec,DDDC + xOONS∆GOONS + xconst.(+xHBNHB)
(5)
where ∆EvdW is the van der Waal contribution, ∆Eelec,DDDC
is the Coulombic energy, computed with a distance
dependent dielectric constant, ∆EOONS is the solvation
energy according to the Oobatake et al. model [55] and
NHB is the number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds.
As mentioned above, the coefficients bear physical meaning. For instance the term xconst should account for rotational and translational entropy loss upon binding and it
can be expected to be in the range 20–40 kcal/mol.
The term proportional to the number of hydrogen bonds
was alternatively added in order to take into account posPage 19 of 24

BMC Structural Biology 2007, 7:61

sible inaccuracies in the treatment of these interactions by
molecular mechanics and solvation terms. In practice
every time this term is added the coefficients of molecular
mechanics and solvation terms are greatly reduced thus
avoiding double counting of hydrogen bond interactions.
A similar expression for the free energy of binding has
been used for the MM/DDDC-HP model:
∆GMM/DDDC-HP = xvdW∆EvdW + xDDDC∆Eelec,DDDC + xH∆AH +
xP∆AP + xconst.(+xHBNHB)
(6)
Here the coefficients xH and xP represent the surface tension coefficients multiplying hydrophobic and polar solvent accessible surface areas ∆AH and ∆AP, respectively. We
expect these coefficients to be in the range of tens of cal Å2 mol-1.
The solvent accessible area has been also splitted in polar
and hydrophobic area for finding optimal scaling parameters for the MM/GBSA methodology:
∆GMM/GBSA = xvdW∆EvdW + xCoul∆ECoul + xGB∆GGB + xH∆AH +
xP∆AP + xconst.(+xHBNHB)
(7)
where ∆GGB is the generalized Born solvation energy. The
coefficients xCoul and xGB are exactly and roughly, respectively, inversely proportional to the effective dielectric
constant and are thus expected to be in the range 0.05 to
1.0.
Possible pitfalls of the method
Scaling energy terms for free energy evaluation of models
which have been minimized without scaling such terms is
clearly inconsistent. A correct procedure would be to iteratively find the optimal scaling factors, minimizing the
energy using such scaling factors and repeating these two
steps until convergence. This procedure faces some difficulties because an important term like the hydrogen bond
term is discrete and does not have a counterpart in standard forcefields, where such interactions are described typically through electrostatic and van der Waals terms.
Similarly the minimization of terms proportional to the
solvent accessible surface area requires algorithms which
are rarely available in molecular mechanics packages. A
further difficulty is that any unbalance among forcefield
terms might introduce distortions in molecular structure,
notably of hydrogen bond lengths. Although the issue of
iteratively fitting optimal scaling factors is worth being
further investigated, here the approach of scaling factors
has been applied in a more rough way. We have matched
as far as possible the energetic model used for minimization with that used for fitting scaling factors, as mentioned
above, but we have not minimized again the models using
the scaling factors. A similar mismatch between confor-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/7/61

mational sampling and energy evaluation is implicit in
the analysis of molecular dynamics snapshots. Other
sources of error in this case are the large conformational
(and energetic) fluctuations molecules undergo during
simulation and in general the inaccuracy of implicit solvent methods (used in energy evaluation) where small
energy differences arise from subtraction of rather large
values. It should be noted that for molecular dynamics
snapshots inaccuracies do not cancel out because there are
no restrained parts in the molecules.
DNA sequence dependent deformability
An important aspect of protein-DNA interaction,
addressed quantitatively by Olson and co-workers [39], is
the capability of DNA sequences to adopt specific local
conformations. The statistics of parameters and pairwise
parameter correlations shows definite preferences. In the
approach described above, changes in intramolecular
energy terms are disregarded altogether by the assumption
of rigid docking. The strains introduced in complex
molecular structures, however, are typically relaxed over
the structure and should have consequences on the intermolecular energy terms too. In order to assess the effect of
DNA sequence dependent deformability we followed the
approach of Olson and co-workers [39], who made available average parameters for the six parameters describing
local geometry of a base-pair step in B-DNA, the force constant parameters for all pairwise deviation from equilibrium values and a program to analyse DNA structures
[95].

The analysis was performed for the native structure
parameters, simply replacing the identity of the base-pair
mutated, and on the mutated structures, minimized using
the generalized Born model. For both cases poor correlation with experimental binding data was found. Remarkably, however, the native sequence was the third lowest
energy sequence among all 52 sequences. Energy minimization in general increases the energy associated with the
deformability of DNA. Computation of the fitness of a
sequence to local geometry parameters gives important
informations although it is likely that the computed
energy is not accurate for conformations far from equilibrium. Inclusion of the DNA sequence dependent deformability energy in the analyses detailed below did not
improve results significantly, notwithstanding the additional scaling parameter introduced for this purpose. For
this reason this term was not considered further.
Performance analysis
After fitting scaling factors to experimental data, the root
mean square difference between calculated and experimental data was computed. This quantity can provide
however a poor evaluation of the predictive power of the
calculations when the test systems are very similar. There-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/7/61

fore the correlation coefficient between calculated and
experimental data was also computed. Optimal scaling
factors were computed taking all the data available.
Fitting 52 experimental data with up to 7 parameters will
always results in a positive correlation coefficient. In order
to make sure that the results obtained are significant we
performed different kind of analyses:
i) a leave-one-out scheme has been adopted. All but one
of the data were taken and the root mean square difference and correlation coefficient were computed using the
set of data not used in the fitting procedure. The same
scheme has been applied to 5000 replicates with one third
of the data left out of the fitting procedure and used for
RMSD and correlation coefficient computation.
ii) the variance of each linear coefficient has been estimated from the multiple regression analysis using the variance/covariance matrix and the square error of computed
data, according to standard linear regression procedures
[96]. In practice the standard deviation of experimental
data has been estimated as

∑ i (Gi,calc − Gi,exptl )2

(8)
n−m
Then the variance of each coefficient has been estimated
from the variance/covariance matrix of coefficients:

σ =

σ 2 (x j ) = ( AT A)−1σ 2
jj

(9)

The different models considered employ a different
number of fitting parameters and therefore different performances are expected. Although these parameters are
often correlated, the analysis of the variance gives an
immediate clue as to which variables are more important.
iii) analysis of variance (ANOVA) calculations have been
performed and a significance test based on the F-statistic
and the corresponding confidence level has been computed [96].
iv) one thousand replicates of the original data has been
generated with the column elements containing the experimental data randomly swapped. The average of the correlation coefficient between swapped experimental data
and fitted data has been computed together with the
standard deviation. The results of this computation (not
reported) fully supports the results of the statistical analyses described above; Finally, a useful alternative to assess
the quality of ∆Gcalc predictions and to compare the different models from a qualitative point of view, consists in
determining the number of "correct predictions", defined
as the number of cases in which both ∆Gexp and ∆Gcalc are

<1.0 kcal/mol, or >1.0 kcal/mol, or else separated by less
than 0.3 kcal/mol. The threshold value of 1.0 kcal/mol
requires some explanations. The experimental values of
the free energy change relative to the wild-type operator
OR1 have been calculated using the equation ∆Gexp = 0.546 ln (Kd of substituted sequence)/(Kd of OR1) after
having determined the dissociation constant of every
mutant. It is simple to verify that the threshold value of
1.0 kcal/mol corresponds to a remarkable reduction in the
dissociation constant of the mutant (ca. 5-fold), with
respect to the dissociation constant of the wild-type operator (Kd of OR1 = 10-9), whereas values of ∆G higher than
1.0 kcal/mol correspond to a reduction in the dissociation
constant from 5 (∆Gexp = 1.0 kcal/mol) to 25-fold (∆Gexp =
3.4, which is the maximum value of ∆Gexp). Therefore it is
reasonable to define ∆Gcalc as correct, if both ∆Gexp and
∆Gcalc are in one of the defined intervals or even if the difference D = |∆Gexp - ∆Gcalc| is lower than 0.3 kcal/mol,
which corresponds to a ratio between the dissociation
constant of a mutant and the dissociation constant of the
wild-type complex lower than 2.0.
Analysis of non-specific protein-DNA binding
One thousand random DNA sequences were generated
and the corresponding structural models were generated
by performing mutations on the double stranded DNA in
the complex crystal structure using the program WHATIF
[73]. The resulting dataset of complexes was assumed to
be representative of non-specific protein-DNA complexes.
We are interested in understanding how reliable is the
method for predicting putative binding sites. The socalled Z-score of the specific bound sequence compared to
random sequences has been considered. The Z-score is
defined here as the distance of the free energy computed
for the specific bound 17-mer (∆G) from the average nonspecific binding energy (< ∆G >), normalized by the
standard deviation of the computed non-specific binding
energies (σG).

Z − score =

∆G− < ∆G >
σG

(10)

Averages are performed over the one thousand random
sequences. A large Z-score implies that the specific bound
sequence can be distinguished from other non-specific
bound sequences. The structures were energy minimized
using the same protocol used for MM/GBSA free energy
estimation. For all minimized complexes the Coulombic
energy, van der Waals energy, GB solvation energy, polar
and apolar surface accessible area and intermolecular
hydrogen bonds number were tabulated. For each model
i of the 1000 random DNA sequence complexes the binding energy G(i) has been computed using different
amounts of the experimental information available. Different analyses, detailed in the Results section, were per-

formed. The possibility of using the data computed on the
set of non-specific complexes for defining a profile of the
recognized DNA sequences has been explored as follows.
The calculated binding energy values for the set of nonspecific complexes were summarised in a set of 68 values
corresponding to the average contribution to the binding
free energy of each possible of the 4 bases at each of the
possible 17 bound sequence positions. These 68 values
have been derived as follows. Possible substitutions are
indexed from 1 to 4 for A, C, G and T, respectively. A 1000
× 68 matrix A was set where each element A(i, j) is 1.0 or
0.0 if the base at position j/4 (rounded at the closer upper
integer) has index j mod 4 in sequence i. The set of 68 substitution free energies x(j) were found by solving (in a root
mean square error sense) the overdetermined equation Ax
= G. The resulting 68-element vector x was arranged in a
17 × 4 matrix. Variants on this procedure are described in
the Results section according to the level of information
available included in the analysis.
Scanning of bacteriophage λ genome
The free energy matrix derived from the analysis of nonspecific protein-DNA complexes was used to score all 17mer subsequences in the bacteriophage λ genome (Accession number: NC_001416.1, 48502 base-pairs) on both
strands. In principle the score represents the free energy of
binding of the 17-mer considered.

Reference "experimental" binding free energy values, for
comparison with computed data, were obtained under
the hypothesis of additivity [69,70] using experimental
data on single base-pair mutants.
