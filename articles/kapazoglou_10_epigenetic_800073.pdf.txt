Abstract
Background: Epigenetic phenomena have been associated with the regulation of active and silent chromatin states
achieved by modifications of chromatin structure through DNA methylation, and histone post-translational
modifications. The latter is accomplished, in part, through the action of PcG (Polycomb group) protein complexes
which methylate nucleosomal histone tails at specific sites, ultimately leading to chromatin compaction and gene
silencing. Different PcG complex variants operating during different developmental stages have been described in
plants. In particular, the so-called FIE/MEA/FIS2 complex governs the expression of genes important in embryo and
endosperm development in Arabidopsis. In our effort to understand the epigenetic mechanisms regulating seed
development in barley (Hordeum vulgare), an agronomically important monocot plant cultivated for its endosperm, we
set out to characterize the genes encoding barley PcG proteins.
Results: Four barley PcG gene homologues, named HvFIE, HvE(Z), HvSu(z)12a, and HvSu(z)12b were identified and
structurally and phylogenetically characterized. The corresponding genes HvFIE, HvE(Z), HvSu(z)12a, and HvSu(z)12b
were mapped onto barley chromosomes 7H, 4H, 2H and 5H, respectively. Expression analysis of the PcG genes revealed
significant differences in gene expression among tissues and seed developmental stages and between barley cultivars
with varying seed size. Furthermore, HvFIE and HvE(Z) gene expression was responsive to the abiotic stress-related
hormone abscisic acid (ABA) known to be involved in seed maturation, dormancy and germination.
Conclusion: This study reports the first characterization of the PcG homologues, HvFIE, HvE(Z), HvSu(z)12a and
HvSu(z)12b in barley. All genes co-localized with known chromosomal regions responsible for malting quality related
traits, suggesting that they might be used for developing molecular markers to be applied in marker assisted selection.
The PcG differential expression pattern in different tissues and seed developmental stages as well as in two barley
cultivars with different seed size is suggestive of a role for these genes in barley seed development. HvFIE and HvE(Z)
were also found to be induced by the plant hormone ABA implying an association with ABA-mediated processes
during seed development, germination and stress response.

methylation of histone 3 on lysine 9 and 27 (H3K9,
H3K27) leads to a repressive chromatin state correlating
with gene silencing whereas methylation of histone 3 on
lysine 4 (H3K4) leads to a permissive chromatin state correlating with gene activation [2]. Histone acetylation and
deacetylation result in active and silent chromatin forms,
respectively [3]. This kind of epigenetic regulation operates on various aspects of plant growth and development,
including seed formation and stress responses (reviewed
in [4,5]).
In flowering plants, the seed is formed through the process of double fertilization. Fertilization of the egg cell by
a sperm cell from the male gametophyte generates the
diploid embryo from which the organs, tissues and shoot
meristems of the plant will be generated. Fertilization of
the adjacent central cell by a second sperm cell forms a
triploid endosperm, in angiosperms, which supports
embryo growth and development by producing storage
proteins, lipids, and starch [6].
Bypass of double fertilization is observed in natural
apomicts or after mutagenesis of specific gene loci. In
Arabidopsis mutations of the FIS (Fertilization Independent Seed) class of genes: FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT SEED (FIE), MEDEA (MEA), FERTILIZATION
INDEPENDENT SEED2 (FIS2), MULTICOPY SUPRESSOR OF IRA1 (MSI1) and BORGIA (BGA), result in the
formation of seed-like structures in the absence of double
fertilization that eventually collapse [7-9]. The phenotype
of fie, mea, fis2 and msi1 mutants is accompanied by
another impressive characteristic, that is, endosperm
overproliferation [9,10]. Endosperm overproduction and
seed size increases are also observed in crosses where
extra paternal genomes or hypomethylated maternal
genomes are used [11]. Another feature of the fis phenotype is that when the female gametophyte carrying a
mutation in a fis locus is fertilized by a wild type plant,
the seed finally collapses indicative of a lethal maternal
effect of the fis mutation and a gametophytic maternal
control over seed development by FIS genes [7,8]. This is
partially attributed to parental imprinting of FIE, MEA
and FIS2 where only the maternal allele is expressed during the early stages of seed development [12-14].
The common phenotypic effects of the fis mutants are
explained by the shared function of the FIS proteins in a
PcG complex. The participation of these proteins in a
PcG complex was first proposed by [10] and it is now well
established that FIE, MEA, FIS2 and MSI1 form the so
called FIE/MEA complex, one of the three PRC2 (Polycomb Repression Complex 2) homologues in Arabidopsis, regulating seed formation [15].
The PRC2 complex also known as EXTRA SEX
COMBS-ENHANCER OF ZESTE (ESC-E(Z)) complex is
one of three PcG complexes in Drosophila. PRC2 has
been shown to play a role in the epigenetic silencing of

Page 2 of 19

target genes involved in cell growth and proliferation and
in early development both in Drosophila and mammals.
Its function involves H3K27 methyltransferase activity
[16]. Methylation of lysines 9 and 27 of histone 3 serve as
epigenetic marks of transcriptional silent loci. The PcG/
PRC2 complex in Drosophila contains four essential subunits: two WD40 proteins, named EXTRA SEX COMBS
(ESC), and P55 containing the WD40 domain involved in
protein-protein interactions, a zinc finger protein,
SUPRESSOR OF ZESTE 12 [Su(z)12], and a SET-domain
protein responsible for methyltransferase activity,
ENHANCER OF ZESTE E(Z) [E(Z)] [17,18].
Different variants of the PRC2 complex have been identified in plants depending on developmental stage, the
best studied one being the FIE/MEA complex which regulates the initiation of seed development [18]. It consists
of FIE, MEA, FIS2 and MSI1, which are homologous to
the Drosophila ESC, E(Z), Su(z)12, and P55, respectively
[19,20,13,10]. In Arabidopsis all PcG complexes are predicted to contain the FIE and MSI1 subunits. Depending
on cell type and function the different PcG complexes
contain one of the three homologues of the Drosophila
EZ protein, MEA, CURLY LEAF (CLF) or SWINGER
(SWN), and one of the three homologues of the Drosophila Su(z)12 protein, EMBRYONIC FLOWER 2 (EMF2),
FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT SEED 2 (FIS2), and
VERNALIZATION2 (VRN2), respectively. The EMF2CLF/SWN-FIE-MSI1 complex has been suggested to play
a role in suppressing the transition from vegetative development to flowering and flower organ formation [15,21]
and the VRN2-CLF/SWN-FIE-MSI1 has been implicated
in the regulation of the process of vernalization
[15,22,23]. EMF2, FIS2 and VRN2, the three Su(z)12-like
proteins in Arabidopsis, contain a classical C2H2 zinc finger similar to the fingers found in sequence-specific
DNA-binding proteins and another stretch of amino
acids, located C-terminal to the zinc finger, that is conserved between DsSu(z)12, HsSu(z)12, EMF2, VRN2 and
FIS2 and has been termed VEFS box (VRN2-EMF2FIS2-Su(z)12 box) [24].
Homologues of the PcG proteins of the FIE-E(Z) complex have been identified in other plant species including
monocots, indicating their involvement in a conserved
regulatory mechanism among all higher plants [17].
Three target genes for the Arabidopsis FIS2-FIE-MEAMSI1 complex operating in seed development have been
identified so far. The first one is PHERES1(PHE1), a type I
MADS box gene [25] which is parentally imprinted in the
developing seed, with the maternal allele being silenced
and the paternal allele expressed in specialized
endosperm cells during the first two days after fertilization [26,27]. The second target is the MEA gene itself,
demonstrating an autoregulating mechanism for the
imprinting of a PcG epigenetic silencer [28,29]. The third

Kapazoglou et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:73

one is FUS3, a transcription factor belonging to the plantexclusive B3 domain TF family, specifically expressed in
seeds during the seed filling phase [30].
Seed development, dormancy and germination are
under the control of plant hormones, in particular ABA
and gibberellic acid (GA). ABA inhibits germination and
is required for the acquisition of dessication tolerance
and entry into seed dormancy acting antagonistically to
GA during these processes [31,32]. It is also involved in
various aspects of plant growth and development including abiotic stress tolerance. Histone modifications have
been suggested to play a major role in ABA-mediated
processes such as seed development, germination and
abiotic stress adaptation [4]. For example, in leaves of
Phaseolus vulgaris, externally supplied ABA has been
shown to induce methylation of H3K4 and acetylation of
H3K14 and H4K5 (indicative of gene activation) of a
chromatin region around the phaseolin promoter, and
ectopic expression of the otherwise silent in leaves phaseolin gene (encoding a major seed storage protein) [33].
Likewise, ABA-treated seeds of an Arabidopsis mutantof
PICKLE (a chromatin remodelling factor mediating suppression of embryonic identity upon germination)
showed high expression levels of the ABA-induced transcription factors, ABI3 and ABI5, involved in seed filling.
This correlated with reduced H3K9 and H3K27 methylation at ABI3 and ABI5 promoters, in the ABA treated
mutant seeds than in wild type seeds [34]. In another
study, ABA treatment caused severe reduction in expression of the Arabidopsis histone deacetylase gene,
AtHD2C, whereas overexpression of AtHD2C resulted in
enhanced abiotic stress tolerance and both repression or
induction of several ABA-responsive genes [35]. Recently,
ABA was suggested to be a positive regulator of SWI3B, a
subunit of the chromatin remodelling complex SWI/SNF,
as in Arabidopsis swi3b mutant seedlings exposed to
external ABA there was reduced expression of ABAresponsive genes [36]. Furthermore, ABA or an ABA signal was suggested to affect epigenetic states, the DNA
replication machinery and chromatin mediated gene
expression in Arabidopsis seedlings [37].
Despite the extensive studies on epigenetic regulation
of seed development in Arabidopsis, knowledge on epigenetic regulation through DNA and chromatin modulation in cereal seed development is only now starting to
emerge. The expression of a large number of genes
encoding structural proteins, metabolic enzymes, transcription factors and DNA and chromatin modulators
during seed development and germination has been
investigated in barley, through large-scale transcriptome
analysis [38]. Very recently, as part of our efforts to study
epigenetic control mechanisms during seed development
in barley, we isolated members of the two families of histone deacetylases, the plant specific HD2 family and the

Page 3 of 19

RPD3/HDA1 family as well as members of the histone
acetyltransferase families, GCN5, MYST, ELP3, respectively, and investigated their expression at different seed
developmental stages, in different grain-size cultivars and
in response to external hormonal stimuli [39-41].
Considering the economic importance of cereal crops
such as barley, rice, wheat and maize, we report here the
characterization of the barley PcG gene homologues.
More specifically, a FIE homologue, termed HvFIE, an
E(Z) homologue, termed HvE(Z), and two Su(z)12-like
homologues, termed HvSu(z)12a and HvSu(z)12b,
respectively, were characterized. The mapping position of
HvFIE, HvE(Z), HvSu(z)12a, and HvSu(z)12b on different
barley chromosomes was assigned, and their expression
was examined in different tissues and seed developmental
stages and in barley cultivars which differ in seed size and
weight. Furthermore, the expression of HvFIE, HvE(Z)
and HvSu(z)12b was investigated after treatment with the
plant hormone ABA, a modulator of gene expression during developmental and environmental changes, operating
often through epigenetic modifications of target genes.

Methods
Plant material

Commercial barley cultivars, Caresse, Carina and Ippolytos, differing in seed size and weight were planted in the
field and were the source of RNA for expression analysis.
For Caresse, the weight of 1000 grains is 50-55 gr, and
98% of seeds have diameter longer than 2.5 mm, for
Carina the weight of 1000 grains is 36-40 gr and 60-65%
of seeds have diameter longer than 2.5 mm whereas for
Ippolytos, seeds weigh 25-31 gr per 1000 grains and only
35-45% of seeds have diameter longer than 2.5 mm http:/
/www.cerealinstitute.gr. The Oregon Wolfe Barley Dominant (OWB-D), Oregon Wolfe Barley Recessive (OWBR), L94 and Vada parental barley lines were used for polymorphism detection and mapping.
Hormonal treatment

Seven-day-old seedlings (Caresse) grown in a growth
chamber (16 hours (h) light, 8 h darkness, at 22Â°C) were
sprayed with 100 Î¼M ABA, (abscisic acid +/- cis, transABA, SIGMA). Aerial parts of plants were collected at 6 h
and 24 h after treatment and immediately stored in liquid
nitrogen. Aerial parts from five plants were pooled
together for RNA extraction for each time point. Control
plants were sprayed with water plus 0.2% Tween.
Identification of barley PcG gene homologues and protein
analysis

The barley FIE and E(Z) homologues were identified by
searching the barley EST database at the TIGR Web site
http://www.tigr.org. Blast searches were performed using
the complete cDNA sequence of Arabidopsis FIE, MEA,

FIS2. Two tentative consensus sequences of barley ESTs
in the TIGR web site, TC134355 and TC140937, were
identified, coding for genes which are homologous to the
Arabidopsis FIE and MEA, respectively. A blastn search
on the NCBI Web site http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
Blast.cgi using TC140937 identified a full length E(Z)
mRNA sequence (AK251149) from the BARLEY DB
http://www.shigen.nig.ac.jp/barley/. Three complete
mRNA sequences encoding Su(z)12-like homologues
were identified in GenBank with accession numbers
AB085817, AB085818, AB085819, respectively. Homology searches were performed with a BLAST algorithm
[42] against the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank database.
Sequence alignments were generated with the Clustal W
Method [43] of MegAlign (LaserGene software) and processed with the Bioedit software. The sequences and
accession numbers used for protein sequence analysis are
shown in Table 1. The phylogenetic tree was calculated
using MEGA 3.1 software [44] by the Neighbor-Joining
Method with p-distance correction [45]. For E(Z), the
Bayesian inference of phylogeny was applied with the use
of MrBayes 3.1.2 [46]. Four Metropolis-coupled Markov
chain Monte Carlo chains were run on one million generations, with sampling every 100 generations. After discarding the first 5,000 unstable trees as burn-in, a
majority-rule consensus tree was visualized and edited
with TreeView 1.6.6 [47].
Mapping of barley PcG genes

Genomic DNAs extracted from 94 'OWB-Dominant' x
'OWB-Recessive' [48] doubled haploid lines and from 103
'L94' x 'Vada' [49] recombinant inbred lines were used for
linkage analyses. Specific PCR primer pairs were
designed based on the nucleotide sequences of the PcG
genes by using the software Primer3 [50] (Table 2). PCR
amplifications were performed in a 20 Î¼l final volume
containing: 40 ng of genomic DNA as template, 1Ã Promega PCR buffer, 1.5 mM of MgCl2, 5% DMSO, 0.25 mM
of each dNTP, 0.4 Î¼M of each primer, and 1 U of Taq
DNA Polymerase (Promega, Madison USA). Reactions
were incubated for 2 min at 94Â°C, followed by 40 cycles of
94Â°C for 30 s, 55Â°C for 30 s, 72Â°C for 1 min, and a final
extension of 72Â°C for 7 min. PCR products were purified
using the Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System
(Promega, Madison USA), and sequenced on both
strands to confirm their identities, then sequences were
aligned using the Staden package http://staden.sourceforge.net to identify Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms
(SNPs). Inspection of the restriction enzyme cleavage
sites with the software WebCutter http://www.firstmarket.com/cutter) revealed HindIII and DdeI restriction
enzyme cleavage polymorphisms in the sequenced
HvE(Z) and HvSu(z)12a PCR products, respectively. For
HvSu(z)12b and HvFIE sequence polymorphisms identi-

Page 4 of 19

fied between the mapping parents were not within
restriction sites, so PCR markers were made by introducing a restriction site (RsaI and DdeI, respectively) into the
PCR product using the dCAPS strategy [51]. According
to manufacturer's instructions, 5 Î¼l of PCR product were
incubated for 1.5 h with 1 U of the corresponding restriction enzyme, 1Ã reaction buffer and 0.1 mg/ml of bovine
serum albumin, and then separated on a standard 2% agarose gel. The positions of the genes in the barley genome
have been determined with high resolution by integrating
the new PcG data with data that are publicly available.
Linkage analysis was performed with the software JoinMap 4.0 [52] by adding the HvFIE and HvEZ markers to
the 'OWB-D' x 'OWB-R' map [53], http://
wheat.pw.usda.gov/ggpages/maps/OWB),
and
the
HvSu(z)12a and HvSu(z)12b markers to the 'L94' x 'Vada'
map [49], http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/report?class=mapdata&name=Barley,+L94+x+Vada,+2006).
RNA isolation and first strand cDNA synthesis

Total RNA was isolated from roots, shoots, apical meristems, first leaves of seedlings, pistils, stamens, whole
flowers before fertilization (immature flower, IMF), seeds
1-3, 3-5, 5-10, 10-15 days after flowering (DAF), and aerial parts after hormonal treatment, respectively, using
TRI REAGENT (SIGMA) according to the instructions of
the manufacturer. First strand cDNA synthesis was performed using 1.0 Î¼g total RNA, 0.5 Î¼g 3' RACE Adapter
primer 5'-GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTAC (T)17-3'
(Invitrogen), 1 mM dNTPs and 200 U M-MuLV reverse
transcriptase (Invitrogen,) in 20 Î¼L total volume, according to the specifications of the manufacturer.
Expression analysis of barley PcG genes

Qualitative RT-PCR was used for examining the expression of the HvFIE, HvE(Z), HvSu(z)12a, HvSu(z)12b and
HvSu(z)12c barley homologues in different tissues.
cDNAs produced from 1 Î¼g of total RNA from roots,
shoot meristems, young shoots, leaves, stamens, and pistils before fertilization from a medium-seed-size cultivar,
Carina, were used. The primer pair Barley Actin F/Barley
Actin R, amplifying a 1111 bp fragment of the barley
actin coding gene [AY145451], was used as internal control for successful cDNA synthesis. The PCR conditions
for actin were: initial denaturation at 94Â°C for 3 min, then
30 cycles at 94Â°C for 30 s, 70Â°C for 1 min, 72Â°C for 2 min
and final extension at 72Â°C for 15 min. The PCR conditions for the HvFIE were: initial denaturation at 94Â°C for 2
min, then 30 cycles of 94Â°C for 30 sec, 53Â°C for 30 sec,
72Â°C for 40 sec and final extension at 72Â°C for 10 min.
The same thermocycler program was used for the fragment amplification of the other four genes, except for the
annealing step which was 57Â°C for HvE(Z), HvSu(z)12b,
and HvSu(z)12a, and 62Â°C for HvSu(Z)12c respectively.

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed with
cDNA synthesized from 1 Î¼g of total RNA from immature flowers, seeds 1-3 DAF, 3-5 DAF, 5-10 DAF, and 1015 DAF from Caresse and Ippolytos, respectively, and
aerial parts of Caresse seedlings after ABA treatment. For
each sample a reaction was set up in a PCR reaction mix
(20 Î¼l) containing 5 Î¼l of the 1:200 diluted cDNA, 0.25
Î¼M of each primer and 1Ã Platinum SYBR Green qPCR
Supermix-UDG (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) and using an
Opticon 2 (MJ Research, Waltham, MA) real-time PCR
system and the Opticon Monitor 3 software package (MJ
Research). Each reaction was performed in triplicates.
General thermocycler conditions were 50Â°C for 2 min,
95Â°C for 2 min, then 42 cycles of 95Â°C for 30 sec, annealing [HvE(Z): 56Â°C; HvFIE: 57Â°C; HvSu(z)12b: 54Â°C,
respectively] for 30 sec, 72Â°C for 30 sec, then 72Â°C for 5
min and plate read at 82Â°C. To identify the PCR products
a melting curve was performed from 65Â°C to 95Â°C with
observations every 0.2Â°C and a 10-s hold between observations. Relative quantification and statistical analysis
were performed with the REST software [54] and using
actin as the reference gene with HvActinF/HvActinR as
primers. The barley gene HVA22, which is known to be
induced by ABA [55] was used as a positive control. All
primers used in expression analysis correspond to nonconserved regions and are shown in Table 2.

Results
Identification of barley PcG gene homologues and analysis
of putative proteins

A blast search of the Hordeum vulgare EST database in
TIGR http://www.tigr.org detected an EST (TC134355)
corresponding to FIE and an EST (TC140937) corresponding to E(Z), respectively. TC134355 contains a full
length cDNA sequence (1623 nt translating to 378 aa) of a
barley FIE homologue, which we termed HvFIE. Amino
acid sequence alignment of plant FIE homologues
revealed that the HvFIE putative protein belongs to the
highly conserved FIE family and that it contains the seven
characteristic WD40 repeats (Figure 1).
TC140937 contains a partial cDNA sequence (1151 nt)
corresponding to a barley E(Z) homologue which we
termed HvE(Z). A tblastn search with this sequence
revealed a full length mRNA sequence (AK251149) from
the BARLEY DB http://www.shigen.nig.ac.jp/barley/
which contains 3092 nt encoding 884 aa of an E(Z) homologue. The putative E(Z) protein from barley, HvEZ, contains the characteristic SET-domain and the cysteine-rich
region as shown in the alignment of the E(Z) amino acid
sequences from different organisms (Figure 2). The barley protein has 94% identity with the E(Z) protein from
wheat (TmEZ), and 70% identity with the EZ2 and EZ3
proteins from maize (MEZ2, MEZ3).

A search in GenBank identified three complete mRNA
sequences from barley coding for Su(z)12-like homologues with accession numbers AB085817, AB085818,
and AB085819 which we named HvSu(z)12a, HvSu(z)12b,
and HvSu(z)12c, respectively. These sequences encode
putative proteins of 660 aa, 637 aa, and 460 aa, respectively. They all contain the characteristic zinc finger
domain found in VEFS proteins, and the HvSu(z)12a,
HvSu(z)12b putative proteins also contain the conserved
VEFS domain as shown in the VEFS protein alignment
(Figure 3). The HvSu(z)12c amino acid sequence terminates before the VEFS domain but this could be due, in
part, to a sequencing problem at the 3' end of the particular cDNA as the nucleotide sequence of AB085819 contains unexplained repeats. Because of this problem we
decided not to study HvSu(z)12c any further. HvSu(z)12a
and HvSu(z)12b share 58% identity with each other.
HvSu(z)12b is highly similar to a wheat EMF protein
TaEMF, with 93% identity.
A phylogenetic analysis of FIE homologues in plants
showed that HvFIE is more closely related to other cereal
FIE proteins, specifically, ZmFIE2 from maize and
OsnFIE2 from rice (Figure 4A). Similarly, phylogenetic
analysis of E(Z) proteins from monocots and dicots
showed that HvEZ groups out together with TmEZ,
MEZ2, MEZ3 and OsiEZ1, whereas AtCLF, MEZ1, OsjEZ
form another cluster and AtSWN and AtMEA are more
distant to both groups (Figure 4B). A phylogenetic analysis of various VEFS proteins from different organisms
(Figure 4C) showed that HvSu(z)12b is more closely
related to EMF proteins from wheat, dendrocalamus,
oryza and maize, whereas HvSu(z)12a forms a cluster
with two other EMF proteins from rice. They are both
more distantly related to the Arabidsopsis EMF, FIS2, and
VRN proteins and their isoforms, and from the animal
Su(z)12 homologues (Drosophila, mouse, and human)
which cluster together.
Mapping of barley PcG genes

HindIII cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS)
and DdeI derived cleaved amplified polymorphic
sequence (dCAPS) markers were developed for the mapping of HvE(Z) and HvFIE on the OWB molecular linkage
map, respectively. Linkage analysis revealed that HvE(Z)
maps in a cluster of 43 molecular markers in the centromeric region of chromosome 4H, and HvFIE co-segregates with RFLP marker MWG808 and other 52 markers
in the pericentric region of chromosome 7H (Figure 5).
CAPS (DdeI) and dCAPS (RsaI) marker segregation analyses were performed for mapping HvSu(z)12a and
HvSu(z)12b on the LxV linkage map. HvSu(z)12a and
HvSu(z)12b are located on the short arm of chromosome
2H and on the subcentromeric region of the long arm of
chromosome 5H, respectively (Figure 5).

Figure 1 Alignment of the amino acid sequences of the FIE homologues in different plants. The sequences and accession numbers used for
protein sequence analysis are shown in Table 1. Identical and similar amino acid residues are shaded in dark grey and light grey, respectively. WD 40
repeats are marked above the sequences with grey lines.

Differential expression of barley PcG genes in different
tissues and seed developmental stages and in two cultivars
with varying seed size

Qualitative RT-PCR was performed in order to examine
the expression of HvFIE, HvE(Z), HvSu(z)12a and
HvSu(z)12b in different tissues, in a medium-seed-size
cultivar, Carina (Figure 6A). The HvFIE mRNA is abundant in shoot meristems, young shoots, pistils before fertilization and seeds of 1-2 DAF and 3-5 DAF, whereas it is
hardly detectable in roots, leaves and stamens. The
HvE(Z) transcript is abundant in young shoots and 3-5
DAF seeds, moderate in the other tissues, and detectable
in stamens. The HvSu(z)12b transcript is abundant in
young shoots, at moderate levels in 1-2 DAF seeds and at
low levels in the other tissues. The HvSu(z)12c transcript
is abundant in young shoots, present at moderate levels in

leaves, at low levels in seeds 1-2 DAF and 3-5 DAF and
undetectable in the other tissues examined, whereas the
HvSu(z)12a transcript is undetectable in all tissues examined except from young shoots where a very faint band is
observed.
Quantitative real-time PCR was performed in order to
compare the levels of HvFIE, HvE(Z), and HvSu(z)12b
mRNA accumulation at different stages of seed development and between two barley cultivars with different
seed size, Caresse (larger seed size) and Ippolytos
(smaller seed size) (Figure 6B). HvSu(z)12a was not
included in this analysis, owing to its negligible expression. Similarly, HvSu(z)12c was excluded due to undetectable or low expression in reproductive tissue and seed,
respectively.

PcG gene has been mapped is indicated following the notation of [49] that integrates data from 6 segregating populations including both the OWB
and the LxV maps.

HvFIE mRNA accumulation exhibits an increase after
fertilization, in both Caresse and Ippolytos. In Caresse
HvFIE transcript levels reach a maximum at 3-5 DAF
(C7) with approximately a 5 fold increase as compared to
immature flowers (C5) and decrease thereafter to about
50% in 10-15 (C9) DAF. Conversely, in Ippolytos, HvFIE
exhibits a continuous induction with a pronounced
increase up to 7 fold at 10-15 DAF (IP9) as compared to
immature flowers (IP5). At 5-10 DAF and at 10-15 DAF,
HvFIE transcript levels are markedly higher in Ippolytos
(approximately 1.5 and 3.5 fold, respectively) as compared to Caresse (Figure 6B).
HvE(Z) transcript levels decline after 1-3 DAF (C6) in
Caresse, with maximum decrease in 3-5 DAF (2 fold
reduction as compared to immature flowers) whereas
comparable decrease was not observed in 3-5 DAF (IP7)
for Ippolytos. Contrary to Caresse, HvE(Z) expression
levels in Ippolytos do not show any significant changes in

any of the stages before fertilization and throughout seed
development.
HvSu(z)12b transcript levels are increased after fertilization at the stages 5-10 and 10-15 DAF as compared to
immature flowers, both for Caresse and Ippolytos. No
significant differences are observed among immature
flowers, 1-3 DAF and 3-5 DAF, in either cultivar, and
HvSu(z)12b levels are comparable between cultivars
throughout seed development.
Expression analysis of barley PcG genes after treatment
with ABA

Quantitative real time PCR was performed using total
RNA from seven-day-old seedlings subjected to exogenous ABA (100 Î¼M) to examine whether HvFIE and
HvE(Z) respond to this seed developmental and stressrelated hormone (Figure 7). HvFIE showed a striking 10
fold induction at 24 h after ABA spraying of seven-day-

HvE(Z) showed a marked induction of approximately 4
fold, both at 6 h and 24 h after ABA treatment, as compared to the untreated control. Expression of HvSu(z)12b
did not show any significant changes after ABA treatment

Discussion
In the current study we present the identification, mapping and expression profiles of the genes encoding PcG
chromatin modifiers from barley. This work serves as a
first step in understanding the role played by PcG genes
in the epigenetic mechanisms that control seed formation
and stress response in a monocot cereal plant. Unlike
dicots, where the endosperm is consumed by the embryo
during seed maturation, in monocots such as cereals, the
endosperm persists after embryo development is completed and constitutes the major portion of the mature
kernel [6,7]. The endosperm of cereal crops like barley,
wheat, rice, maize, stores reserves such as proteins,
starch, and fatty acids, and represents 60% of the world's
food and feed supply. Consequently, understanding and
manipulating the molecular mechanisms governing
endosperm development for increasing seed yield is of
utmost interest for agriculture.
Four barley PcG gene homologues encoding the putative PcG proteins HvFIE, HvEZ, HvSu(z)12a and
HvSu(z)12b were identified and analyzed. In Arabidopsis
the respective PcG counterparts are [AtFIE], [AtMEA or
AtSWN or AtCLF] and [AtFIS2 or AtEMF2 or AtVRN2].
Three different PcG complex variants can be formed
depending on the different combinations of these subunits. The changeable subunits are the MEA and FIS2
homologues whereas FIE is likely to be common in all
three complexes. The FIE, MEA, FIS2 proteins form a
complex essential for viable seed formation. MEA, CLF,
and SWN, constitute the three Arabidopsis E(Z) homologues, which cluster into three separate clades, and are
members of different PcG complexes with distinct functions. MEA is important for proper seed development
and SWN acts redundantly with MEA having a role in
preventing endosperm development as well [56]. However according to another report by Spillane et al. 2007
[57], swn/clf double mutants in Arabidopsis produce normal seeds suggesting that neither SWN nor CLF has a
role in seed formation. In addition, SWN and CLF are
involved in the vernalization process [23]. It was proposed that these homologues have arisen through an old
duplication and separation of CLF from the MEA/SWN
lineage, which occurred before the divergence of monocots and dicots, whereas a more recent duplication produced the separation between MEA and SWN in only a
few species [57]. No direct orthologues of MEA have
been found in any other species than Arabidopsis. E(Z)

homologues identified in maize and rice [58-60], two
monocots with sequenced genomes, cluster in two clades:
ZmMEZ2, ZmMEZ3 and OsiEZ1 form the so-called
SWN-like clade, and ZmMEZ1 and OsjEZ (also named
OsCLF) form the CLF-like clade. Phylogenetic analysis
showed that the barley homologue HvEZ is a close relative of the wheat, rice and maize E(Z) homologues
belonging in the SWN-like clade. Unlike Arabidopsis,
which has at least three E(Z) homologues functioning at
different stages of the plant's life cycle, a second HvEZ
homologue has not been identified in barley as yet. It
might be possible that HvEZ is a common member of the
different PcG complex variants that may be operating at
different stages of barley development. However, this
hypothesis awaits sequencing of the barley genome and
further experimentation. In the absence of a MEA counterpart it is possible that the role of MEA is played by one
of the putative SWN or CLF homologues both in barley
and in the other species lacking MEA.
HvFIE maps on chromosome 7Hcen which is colinear
with rice chromosome 8, where the rice OsnFIE2 homologue (Os08g04270) has been also localized. HvE(Z) maps
on chromosome 4Hcen which is colinear with rice chromosome 3, where the rice OsiEZ1 homologue
(Os03g19480) is found [60]. Similarly, HvSu(z)12a maps
on chromosome 2Hshort which is colinear with rice
chromosome 4, where the OsEMF (Os04g08034) homologue is localized, and HvSu(z)12b maps on chromosome
5Hlong which is colinear with rice chromosome 9 where
the rice homologue OsVEF (Os09g13630)is localized
[60]. These observations are in agreement with the extensive synteny between barley and rice chromosomes.
HvFIE and Hv(E)Z are located in the centromeric
region of chromosome 7H and 4H repectively, where
important clusters of malting quality QTLs have been
identified by several authors and reviewed by [61]. Noteworthy, using the Oregon Wolfe Barley map [53] that
integrates 2383 loci and a comprehensive summary of
154 QTLs of malting quality http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/
ggpages/maps/OWB/, it is possibile to relate the high resolution genomic location of the two PcG genes with historical QTL data. Hv(E)Z location is coincident with
scind03751 and 1.1 cM proximal to Tef2, the significant
marker for the beta-Glucanase activity QTL
(QBgsg.StMo-4H) identified in the Steptoe x Morex population. HvFIE maps to a cluster of OPA and DArT markers that includes MWG808 and is 10 cM proximal to
MWG2031, the significant marker for both Grain protein
content (QGpc.HaMo-7H) and Kernel plumpness
(QKp.HaMo-7H) in the Harrington x Morex population.
Likewise the map position of the two Su(z)12 homologues (HvSu(z)12a on the short arm of chromosome 2H
and HvSu(z)12b close to the centromere of chromosome
5H), is in proximity to genomic regions historically

Figure 7 Expression analysis of barley PcG genes after treatment of seedlings with ABA. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of HvFIE and HvE(Z)
genes at 6 and 24 h after treatment of Caresse seedlings with 100 Î¼M ABA. Expression values were normalized to those of HvActin. Data represent
mean values from two independent experiments with standard deviations. Relative expression ratio of each sample was compared to the control
group which was untreated plants, 0 h, and was assigned the value of 1. Grey bars, hormone-treated plants for 6 h and 24 h; white bars, no hormone
treated plants (mocked with H2O/Tween for 6 h and 24 h, respectively). Values significantly different (P < 0.05) from the control group are marked with
an asterisk. The barley gene HVA22 (known to be induced by ABA) was used as positive control.

involved in the genetic control of malting quality traits
[61]. However, all these gene-QTL relationships cannot
be unequivocally established and thus further research is
needed to determine the role of PcG in endospermrelated traits.
Qualitative RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that the
barley HvFIE shows a tissue expression profile similar to
that of AtFIE, maize ZmFIE2 and rice OsFIE2
[13,62,58,63,60] in that it is expressed in both vegetative
and reproductive tissues. Similarly, the barley HvE(Z) is
expressed throughout development like the maize homologues ZmMEZ1, ZmMEZ2 and ZmMEZ3 [58] and the
rice E(Z) homologues, OsiEZ1 and OsCLF (same as
OsjEZ) [60], whereas AtMEA is not expressed in leaves
[19,12,64]. The expression pattern of HvSu(z)12b is similar to the rice OsEMF homologues, being expressed both
in vegetative and reproductive tissues [60]. Conversely,
AtFIS2 is expressed only in the central cell and
endosperm [13]. No expression studies on the maize
Su(z)12 homologues, ZmEMF-like and ZmEMF2-like,
have been reported so far. The differential expression of
AtMEA and AtFIS2 compared to E(Z) and Su(z)12 homologues from monocots and other dicots, together with the
fact that the protein sequences of AtMEA and AtFIS2, are
distantly related to the E(Z) and Su(z)12 homologues
from cereals and other dicots supports the view proposed
by Luo et al. 2009 [60], that the MEA and FIS2 genes
arose only within the Brassicaceae.
In Arabidopsis, mutations in the PcG genes resulting in
downregulation of AtMEA, AtFIE and AtFIS2, cause
seed-like structure formation in the absence of fertilization and the production of non-viable seeds after fertilization. In both cases endosperm overproliferation has
been observed. Endosperm overproliferation could be a
desirable feature of viable and qualitatively acceptable
seeds in crops where the seed and in particular the
endosperm is the agronomically important product. In
this study we attempted to analyze quantitatively the
expression of the PcG gene homologues in different seed
developmental stages and in two barley cultivars differing
in seed size, in order to unravel any association between
the expression of these genes with seed development and
the size of seed. Quantitative real time PCR expression
analysis revealed a differential expression pattern during
seed development and significant differences between
two barley cultivars with varying seed size for the PcG
genes. HvFIE exhibits a pronounced increase after fertilization for both cultivars, which declines in Caresse after
3-5 DAF, but increases remarkably in Ippolytos (approximately 7 fold) at 5-10 and 10-15 DAF. Interestingly, HvFIE
transcript levels are markedly higher in Ippolytos at 5-10
and 10-15 DAF than in Caresse by approximately a factor
of 1.5 and 3.5, respectively. HvE(Z) expression shows a
decline in Caresse seeds 3-15 days after fertilization as

Page 17 of 19

compared to flowers prior to fertilization, with a marked
2 fold decrease at 3-5 DAF. Conversely, such a reduction
is not observed in Ippolytos, where HvE(Z) transcript levels do not show any significant changes among seed
stages. In barley, endosperm cellularization begins at
approximately 4 DAF and ends at 6-8 DAF, when the seed
maturation process begins [6]. It might be possible that
the differences in HvE(Z) and HvFIE expression between
the two cultivars during these critical stages of
endosperm development are associated with the processes of cellularization and seed filling and ultimately
with the size of seed. For HvSu(z)12b, transcript levels
show an induction after fertilization at 5-10 and 10-15
DAF, implying a role for HvSu(z)12b in the cellularization
and seed maturation process for both cultivars. Further
experiments will be needed to elucidate the precise roles
of these PcG genes in barley seed development.
The plant hormone ABA, is involved in various plant
developmental processes, including seed development,
germination and abiotic stress tolerance. In Arabidopsis,
ABA plays a central signalling role during seed filling,
interacting with master regulator genes such as ABI3 and
FUS3, in a gene activation manner [reviewed in [65]].
Interestingly, FUS3 is one of the targets of both the
AtCLF and AtMEA genes (acting in vegetative and reproductive stages, respectively) and it is silenced in leaves
and closed flowers [30] where it was also shown to contain the repressive mark H3K27me3. In this work we
examined the response of PcG genes to ABA after exogenous ABA application on seedlings and observed that
both HvE(Z) and HvFIE genes are induced by ABA. The
observed increase in HvE(Z) and HvFIE expression upon
ABA treatment suggests that these genes might play a
role as epigenetic regulators of ABA-mediated processes
in seedlings. Chromatin modulators, such as histone
deacetylase genes, have been shown previously to be
affected by exogenous ABA in Arabidopsis, rice and barley [35,66,39]. This is the first time that an induction of
PcG genes upon external ABA exposure has been demonstrated. It is possible that the expression of PcG genes is
also affected by ABA during seed development, to activate or suppress key regulators, as the cell would require.

Conclusions
In this work we have presented the identification and
characterization of four barley PcG genes, HvFIE, HvE(Z),
HvSu(z)12a, and HvSu(z)12b. All genes were mapped on
different barley chromosomes and co-localized with
known chromosomal regions responsible for malting
quality related traits. Should this be confirmed PcG genes
might be used as molecular markers for marker-assisted
selection in breeding programmes. Differential expression of HvFIE, HvE(Z), and HvSu(z)12b in different seed
developmental stages and in two barley cultivars differing

Kapazoglou et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:73

in seed size, suggested a role for these PcG genes in seed
development. In addition HvFIE and HvE(Z) were found
to be induced by the hormone ABA involved in seed
development and stress response. The present work provides a basis for future studies aiming at unraveling the
function of barley PcG genes and understanding seed
development and stress-response epigenetic regulation in
barley and other cereals.
