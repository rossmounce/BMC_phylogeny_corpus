Abstract
Background: The cytoplasmic ribosomal small subunit (SSU, 18S) ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is the most
frequently-used gene for molecular phylogenetic studies. However, information regarding its secondary
structure is neglected in most phylogenetic analyses. Incorporation of this information is essential in order
to apply specific rRNA evolutionary models to overcome the problem of co-evolution of paired sites,
which violates the basic assumption of the independent evolution of sites made by most phylogenetic
methods. Information about secondary structure also supports the process of aligning rRNA sequences
across taxa. Both aspects have been shown to increase the accuracy of phylogenetic reconstructions
within various taxa.
Here, we explore SSU rRNA secondary structures from the three extant classes of Phylum Porifera
(Grant, 1836), a pivotal, but largely unresolved taxon of early branching Metazoa. This is the first
phylogenetic study of poriferan SSU rRNA data to date that includes detailed comparative secondary
structure information for all three sponge classes.
Results: We found base compositional and structural differences in SSU rRNA among Demospongiae,
Hexactinellida (glass sponges) and Calcarea (calcareous sponges). We showed that analyses of primary
rRNA sequences, including secondary structure-specific evolutionary models, in combination with
reconstruction of the evolution of unusual structural features, reveal a substantial amount of additional
information. Of special note was the finding that the gene tree topologies of marine haplosclerid
demosponges, which are inconsistent with the current morphology-based classification, are supported by
our reconstructed evolution of secondary structure features. Therefore, these features can provide
alternative support for sequence-based topologies and give insights into the evolution of the molecule
itself. To encourage and facilitate the application of rRNA models in phylogenetics of early metazoans, we
present 52 SSU rRNA secondary structures over the taxonomic range of Porifera in a database, along with
some basic tools for relevant format-conversion.
Conclusion: We demonstrated that sophisticated secondary structure analyses can increase the
potential phylogenetic information of already available rDNA sequences currently accessible in databases
and conclude that the importance of SSU rRNA secondary structure information for phylogenetic
reconstruction is still generally underestimated, at least among certain early branching metazoans.

Background
Tens of thousands of sequences of the small subunit
ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA, 18S) gene of eukaryotes have
accumulated in public databases such as NCBI GenBank
[1], making this gene one of the first and most frequently
used markers for molecular phylogenetics. Its popularity
is due to a high degree of conservation in some regions of
the molecule, in combination with a considerable
amount of variability in others. These features enable phylogenetic questions to be addressed between relatively
closely related taxa, as well as between different domains
of life [2]. Therefore, analyses of SSU rRNA sequences
have a long history, and new sequences are still being continuously generated.
SSU rRNA molecules fold into a specific secondary structure, which is essential for maintenance of their three
dimensional structure and their function within the ribosome [3], but which also has consequences for the use of
rRNA molecules in phylogenetics. The secondary structure
of rRNAs is maintained by hydrogen bonds between RNA
nucleotides, which form helices (or stems). These helices
are interleaved by regions consisting of unpaired nucleotides, forming loops at the end of a helix and bulges
within different helices. Secondary structure of RNAs is
generally much more conserved than their primary
sequence [2]. Therefore, considering this structure during
multiple sequence alignment can greatly improve the
assignment of homologous positions, consequently
resulting in more probable phylogeny estimations [4-6].
Furthermore, paired nucleotides (= doublets) frequently
co-evolve in order to maintain rRNA structure and function. The co-evolution of doublets violates the assumption of independent evolution of sites made by most
phylogenetic methods [7]. Consequently, specific evolutionary models have been proposed for paired sites and
have been shown to outperform standard (4 × 4) nucleotide models [8-14]. However, secondary structure models are still rarely used in phylogenetic analyses,
presumably because establishing a secondary structure for
a new sequence is still a time-consuming exercise even for
the conserved core structure of SSU rRNA, and very few
software packages allow the simultaneous analysis of
paired and unpaired rRNA regions. Some rRNA databases
[15-18] provide secondary structure information for a
number of organisms, but their records are far from complete and structures of hypervariable insertions are usually
not presented, or are only presented to a certain extent. In
particular, the lower Metazoa, which are pivotal for the
understanding of animal evolution, are still under-represented in databases.
One key taxon for early metazoan evolution is Phylum
Porifera (sponges), in which the relationships are unresolved at all taxonomical levels, even between the three

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/69

extant sponge classes Demospongiae, Calcarea (calcareous sponges) and Hexactinellida (glass sponges). Within
sponge classes, the results of molecular phylogenies are
often incongruent with morphological expectations
[13,19-22]. In this study, we performed the first comprehensive survey of the complete SSU rRNA secondary structures of representatives of the main lineages of Phylum
Porifera, and evaluated how secondary structure information and features other than the primary sequence can
contribute to improve phylogenetic reconstructions. For
these purposes, we considered all available SSU rRNA
sequences of Porifera, inferred their secondary structures
(a selection of which we are presenting in a new database), and analyzed base compositions and sequence
lengths. We reconstructed a phylogeny with partitioned
phylogenetic analyses using specific rRNA models of
nucleotide evolution for paired sites. Using this backbone, we assessed the phylogenetic value of secondary
structures of unique insertions found in a specific demosponge clade (Order Haplosclerida), which would usually
be disregarded as 'unalignable sites' and thus excluded
from standard phylogenetic analyses.

Methods
Sequence acquisition, analyses and inference of secondary
structures
We analyzed all 170 published full or nearly full-length
SSU rRNA sequences of Porifera (see Additional file 1 for
a complete listing). For taxonomy of the taxa included in
our study we followed Systema Porifera [23] and the
World Porifera Database [24], where also the species
authorities are available. The SSU rRNA sequence of
Amphimedon queenslandica was reconstructed by performing a local Blast search [25] against data from GenBank's
trace archive. Traces from significant hits (see Additional
file 2) were downloaded and assembled in CodonCode
Aligner 1.6.3 [26]. This resultant sequence can be downloaded from our database of SSU rRNA secondary structures of Porifera [27]. For Class Hexactinellida, only
limited data was available in GenBank: All three fulllength SSU rRNA sequences belong to Subclass Hexasterophora. Two additional hexactinellid sequences were provided by Martin Dohrmann ahead of their publication in
a comprehensive phylogenetic study of Hexactinellida
[28]: Semperella schulzei (subclass Amphidiscophora) and
Aphrocallistes vastus (Subclass Hexasterophora).

All sequences were initially aligned with CLUSTAL W 1.83
[29] and the preliminary alignments were manually
improved in SeaView [30]. Gblocks 0.91b [31] was used
to identify and isolate the conserved sites of the alignment
before clustering similar sequences using the Neighbor
Joining (NJ) algorithm in PAUP* 4.0b10 [32]. Secondary
structures for resulting clades were established for certain
representatives of the clade by aligning to known struc-

tures from the European RNA Database [18,33] in separate alignments for each clade and considering
compensatory base changes. SSU rRNA clade-alignments
were then further refined according to secondary structure
information.
The unusual structures of marine Haplosclerida (= Order
Haplosclerida excluding Suborder Spongillina) and Hexactinellida (including conserved flanking regions with
known structure) were initially examined under minimum free energy predictions from the mfold-server [34].
In most cases, only one structure was predicted by the
algorithm. If multiple structures were predicted, we chose
the structure with either the minimal free energy or with
the best compatibility to similar sequences.
A comparative approach [35] was chosen if permitted by
an appropriate level of sequence divergence. For this
approach, we used the alifold server [36] to infer secondary structures of the insertions. Alifold infers secondary
structures by considering both minimum free folding
algorithms and compensatory base changes, and therefore
includes additional information that provides hints for
secondary structural motifs. Since this method requires a
correct alignment, it could only be used if sequences were
not too divergent from each other, such as with a subset
of marine Haplosclerida (Demospongiae) and the insertions of Hexasterophora (Hexactinellida) (Additional file
3). However, secondary structures inferred with both
methods were identical, or only differed in a few positions
(Additional file 3, p. III). Therefore, while the comparative
method is preferred, we still found that minimum free
energy based predictions performed adequately to be used
in cases where unambiguous alignments or missing comparative data does not allow inference of secondary structures based on compensatory base exchanges. For taxa
that were suitable for a comparative approach, compensatory base exchanges are presented together with the corresponding alignments in Additional file 3.
We visualized selected structures by converting the
sequence and structure information to a ct-format with a
Perl-script. This format can be displayed in RNAviz 2
[37,38]. Helix names correspond to Wuyts et al. [39], with
the exception of helices E23_1 and E23_2, which together
are referred to as E23_1. Insertions are designated by the
name of the conserved helix in which they occur, and a
period plus the number of the additional helix is added:
Parts of conserved helices separated by insertions are
named after the original helix followed by a letter (e.g.,
one helical insertion within E23_1 will be called E23_1.1,
the 5' part of the helix before the insertion will be called
E23_1a, the 3' part after the insertion E23_1b).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/69

Base compositions and the lengths of the secondary structure features were calculated with a custom-made Perl
script. To avoid biases introduced by missing data from
the published sequences, we used a fragment (corresponding to ca. 95% of SSU rRNA) spanning from helix 5
until 2 bp before helix 50 (i.e. positions 48–1896 in
Amphimedon queenslandica), and only considered the 123
sequences without data missing within this region (listed
in Additional file 4). Representative poriferan secondary
structures are available as *.fasta-format (with bracket-dot
annotation) and in *.ct-format from our database for SSU
rRNA secondary structures of Porifera [40]. Furthermore,
several Perl scripts (written for Mac OS X/Linux) for format conversion are provided (along with other scripts:
Tools for conversion from annotated alignments to ct-format and vice versa, and from alignments to MrBayes or
PHASE data-files containing the secondary structure information are included).
Phylogenetic analyses
The secondary structure information from the previous
step was used to generate a new alignment in SeaView. We
generated a taxon-set comprising of 78 taxa (for accession
numbers see Additional file 5) and focused on relationships of haplosclerid demosponges, in a similar way to
Redmond et al. [41]. The SSU rRNAs from this diverse
taxon have been found to possess numerous insertions
and extensions and our aim was to unravel their evolution.

Sites with uncertain homology even after considering secondary structure were excluded from the phylogenetic
analyses. This was achieved by assigning sites to two
groups and discarding those sites that were regarded as
ambiguously aligned by the following criteria:
1. Unpaired sites: with length polymorphism and
sequence divergence too high to identify homologous
positions for all sequences. (Bulge after 3' helix 8; loops of
helices 6, 10, E10_1,11,17, E23_12, 29, 44, 49)
2. Paired sites: with length polymorphisms in helices and/
or structural homologies that could not be unambiguously assigned (e.g., in cases of elongation of helices, parts
of helices 10, E10_1, E23_1/E23_2, 49).
Furthermore, taxon-specific insertions within helices
(found in some marine Haplosclerida), as well as nucleotide insertions found only in single sequences were
excluded.
Doublet positions were only regarded as pairings in the
consensus secondary structure if the two involved nucleotides formed a Watson-Crick (G-C, A-U) or G-U wobble
pairing in at least five sequences within the alignment.

Corresponding sites falling below this five-sequence
threshold were treated as unpaired. For phylogenetic
reconstructions, sites were allocated to one of the following two partitions: Partition 'stem' (= paired sites) or partition 'loop' (= unpaired sites). We used MrBayes 3.1.2
[42] and PHASE 2.0 [43] for the phylogenetic analyses, as
both programs allow the simultaneous analysis of a partitioned dataset with both rRNA models for paired sites and
standard models for unpaired sites.
MrBayes only allows the usage of a doublet model corresponding to the SH model [9]. This is a 16 state-RNA
model, which considers all possible doublets as characters
and assumes that compensatory base exchanges result
from at least two substitution events. A GTR + G + I model
[44] was assigned for the loop partition. The Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis comprised two runs
(eight chains each) for 12.142 million generations, with
the sample frequency set to 100 and the temperature for
the heated chains set to 0.2. Sampled trees were summarized using the sumt command in MrBayes with a burn-in
set to the first 2 million generations. Sufficient convergence of chains for the Mr Bayes runs was monitored by
observing log-likelihood values, the standard derivation
of split frequencies (> 0.008), and diagnostics provided by
AWTY [45,46].
In PHASE, we applied the RNA7A model [2] and RNA7D
model [11] for stem regions in independent runs. RNA7A
is the most general 7-state RNA model. RNA7D (seven frequencies, four rate parameters) is a simplification of
RNA7A (7 frequencies, 21 rate parameters). The 7-state
RNA models treat all mismatches as one single state. This
simplification increases the risk of loss of phylogenetic
information, but the occurrence of mismatch-pairs in
rRNA data is small, therefore, an estimation of mismatch
substitution parameters from the data is probably not
accurate [47]. Furthermore, by pooling mismatches into a
single character, the number of parameters to be estimated in a phylogenetic analysis, and consequently the
computational demands are significantly decreased. For
loop regions, the REV model [44] was chosen. In addition,
a gamma distribution accounting for rate heterogeneity
among sites and a proportion of invariant sites were
assigned to each model for both partitions. Independent
runs were performed in PHASE 2: Two runs with the
RNA7A model (40 million generations) and one run (5
million generations) with the RNA7D model for stem
positions. Every 100th generation a sample was taken
from the MCMC chains (after a burn-in-phase of 1 million generations).
Tracer v1.4 [48] was used to monitor sufficient parameter
stabilization. To create readable input files for Tracer from
the PHASE runs, we used a slightly modified version of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/69

the perl script 'phase2tracer.pl' (originally programmed
by Matt Yoder [49]), which is available upon request.
The presented tree topology is based upon one of the 40
million PHASE runs with the RNA7A model for stem partition (loop model as mentioned above). To obtain
branch-lengths for the tree, we conducted an additional
analysis (4 million generations) under the same models,
and tree topology was fixed to the consensus tree from the
original 40 million generation analysis as suggested in the
PHASE manual (all other parameters unchanged).

Results
SSU rRNA length differences and base composition
To avoid biases due to missing data, we analyzed base
composition and sequence length for a fragment of SSU
rRNA that covers about 95 % of the gene (see Methods).
Base composition and fragment length differed considerably among the 123 poriferan sequences (Fig. 1). The GC
content varied between 45.5 and 56.3 %.

Calcarea posses the lowest GC contents with a modest variation from 45.5 to 46.8 %. In this aspect they are clearly
separated from demosponges, which display significantly
higher GC contents, since the lowest demosponge value
(47.1%) still exceeds the highest GC content (46.8%) of
Calcarea (Fig. 1). Most demosponge SSU rRNAs show
modest length variations in a range comparable to those
of Calcarea. Notable exceptions are the extraordinary large
rRNA molecules found in several marine haplosclerids.
The highest GC contents of Porifera are also found within
this group (with a maximum of 56.3% in Amphimedon
queenslandica). The high GC pattern is independent of the
presence of insertions in these large molecules, since
members of marine Haplosclerida with smaller rRNA
molecules also possess similar GC contents (Fig. 1). SSU
rRNAs of the few available hexactinellid sponges are
approximately equal in length to large molecules of several haplosclerids (with the exception of Farrea occa [GenBank: AF159623], see below). In contrast to haplosclerids,
hexactinellid sponges have lower GC contents, with base
compositions in the range of those of Demospongiae and
Calcarea.
Secondary structure
Porifera have the typical eukaryotic core SSU rRNA structure (see Figs. 2, 3, 4). The moderate length variation
between Calcarea and most demosponges is primarily
caused by insertions in unpaired regions or by elongation
of helices 10, E10_1 and 43 (Table 1). In Hexactinellida,
on average, these three helices are largely elongated compared to Calcarea and Demospongiae (Fig. 3), but the
lengths of the E10_1 helices of some demosponge
sequences fall into the same range.

fragment were considered (n = 123). Note that Farrea occa (Hexactinellida, [GenBank: AF159623]) is an incomplete potential
pseudogene sequence.

In addition, we observed extra-helical insertions in Hexactinellida and in several marine haplosclerid demosponges that are not part of the eukaryote core structure. In
marine haplosclerids, these extra sequences were inserted
within helices E23_1, E23_14 and 43, and in Hexactinell-

ida, the insertions only occurred within helix E23_1 at a
different position than in marine haplosclerids (Figs. 3,
4). All of the helices where sequence elongations and/or
insertions occur belong to regions that are known to be
highly variable within eukaryotes [39,50].

Calcarea
The SSU rRNA of this sponge class comprises all of the
typical eukaryote helices and lacks unusual structural features. A calcarean SSU rRNA consensus sequence and
structure is shown in Fig. 2. Several synapomorphies for
the two Calcinea and Calcaronea subclasses were detected
in the secondary structure. In Calcinea, helices 10 and
E23_1 are shorter by at least one base pair when compared to Calcaronea (Fig. 2, insets I & III). In helix E10_1,
Calcaronea typically have three pairs at the helix end,
whereas Calcaronea dominantly possess four pairs (Fig. 2,
inset II). However, independent elongations of this helix
can be found in both subclasses (Fig. 2, inset IIa: Calcaronea: Plectroninia neocaledoniense; Calcinea: Soleneiscus
radovani). These elongations are homoplasies as is evident
when considering the subclass-specific compensatory
base change (Calcaronea: A-U; Calcinea: G-C) at the
beginning of inset II (Fig. 2): The A-U pair in the corresponding structure of the calcaronean Leucascandra caveolata (Borojevic & Klautau, 2000) supports a secondary loss
of a pair compared to other Calcaronea. Differences in
helix nucleotides between both subclasses occur in helices
11, E23_7, E23_14 and 29 (Fig. 2, and insets IV and V).
Most of these changes maintain the helix-relevant pairings
(e.g., in 11 or E23_7), but a few cause mismatches in at
least some sequences (in E23_7, E23_14, 29 and 49). Base
changes and insertions in unpaired regions are also specific for the Calcinea-Calcaronea split. This is indicated in
Fig. 2 for three bases in the bulge between helices 8 and 9,
one base within the loop of E23_12, and a calcaroneanspecific insertion of one adenosine between helix 9 and
10.
Hexactinellida
The SSU secondary structure of Acanthascus dawsoni is presented in Fig. 3 representatively for Hexactinellida. In all
hexactinellid sequences, specific insertions were observed
(Fig. 3 inset). As mentioned previously, hexactinellid SSU
rRNA sequences are considerably longer than in other
poriferans, except in some marine haplosclerid demosponges (Fig. 1). The additional nucleotides occur in extensive elongations of common helices (10, E10_1, and 43;

Table 1, Fig. 3), and a helical insertion in helix E23_1. The
insertions in helix E23_1 occur at a unique position
among sponges and may form two helices (assigned the
names E23_1b.1 and E23_1b.2 in Fig. 3) in all the studied
SSU rRNA molecules of subclass Hexasterophora. Helix
E23_1b.2 contains 10 doublets and is much more conserved within Hexasterophora than Helix E23_1b.1,
which varies in length from 37 to 55 bp. In contrast to
Hexasterophora,
Semperella
schulzei
(Subclass
Amphidiscophora) has a helical insertion of 107 bp
within E23_1, which is predicted to form a single helix
E23_1b.1 (Fig. 3 inset).
Within the sequence of Farrea occa [GenBank: AF159623],
we found deletions in conserved regions. Helices 13 and
15 are missing completely, as are the 3' strand of helix 7,
parts of helix 43 and the 5' strand of helix 15 (compare
Fig. 3). Such complete or partial deletion of conserved
helices has been shown to be typical for non-functional
rRNA pseudogenes [51]. Potential paralogs like this one
are not necessarily subject to concerted evolution, and are
therefore not suitable for phylogenetic inference. In this
context, the consideration of secondary structure is crucial
for identification of such non-functional sequences, and
prevents biases in phylogenetic reconstruction due to
potentially misleading data. Nonetheless, predictions of
insertions for this sequence are displayed in Fig. 3 (inset),
since no suspicious modifications were found within this
part of the molecule and no other sequence of Farreidae
was available. However, the results for this species should
be treated with caution.
Demospongiae
Most demosponges possess a SSU rRNA molecule with
the common metazoan secondary structure. Remarkable
exceptions are only found within the marine Haplosclerida (Figs. 4, 5, 6), which possess insertions that are long
enough to be predicted to form additional helices. Those
helices are found within known variable regions for
eukaryotes and appear in the 5' strand of Helix E23_1/2,
the 5'strand within Helix E23_14 and the 3' strand of helix
43.
Phylogenetic analyses
We inferred the phylogeny of marine haplosclerids to
compare the evolutionary history of helical insertions
found in this group of Demospongiae (see section "Successive evolution of additional helices in marine haplosclerids"). Results from the PHASE- and MrBayes analyses
of 78 taxa are shown in Fig. 5. Although more general 7state models have been shown to result in higher likelihood values for phylogenies than less parameter-rich
models for real rRNA data [47], our analyses with PHASE
with the RNA7A model and the less complex RNA7D
model yielded identical tree topologies (with almost iden-

tical support values). Independent runs in PHASE and
MrBayes resulted in similar, almost identical topologies,
and differences in demosponge relationships were only
observed in the positions of clades with weak support values. Namely these are the relationship of Dictyoceratida
to the Myxospongiae (sensu Borchiellini et al. 2004 [=
clade Verongida +Chondrosia reniformis]), the position of
Scopalina ruetzleri and relationships within freshwater
sponges (where branch lengths were short, Fig. 5). Additionally, differences were observed in Calcarea and Cnidaria.
The order Haplosclerida was not resolved as monophyletic, since Suborder Spongillina (freshwater sponges)
fell into other distantly related demosponge clades, rather
than into marine Haplosclerida. The two suborders, Haplosclerina (families Callyspongiidae, Chalinidae and
Niphatidae) and Petrosina (represented here by the families Petrosiidae and Phloeodictyidae) were not supported
as monophyla (Fig. 6). These results are congruent with
results from former analyses of SSU rRNA, 28S rRNA and
cytochrome oxidase subunit I [20,22,52].
According to our analysis, Amphimedon queenslandica
(Family Niphatidae) is most closely related to Oceanapia
sp. (Family Phloeodictyidae), with Xestospongia muta
(Family Petrosiidae) as sister taxon, and both nodes in the
tree are very highly supported by posterior probability
(PP) values in both Bayesian analyses. Other species of the
family Niphatidae (Niphates sp. and Dasychalina fragilis)
are not closely related to each other or to Amphimedon
queenslandica (Fig. 6). In addition, other members of families Petrosiidae and Phloeodictyidae are not found in a
closer relationship to the three species clade. Our results
were mostly concordant with Redmond et al. [41], but
with higher support values in several clades. We did not
find any monophyletic haplosclerid families or genera in
our taxon set. Differences between our results and the previous study are highlighted at the nodes in Fig. 5. We
could not recover monophyletic Petrosiidae in clade I,
and relationships of several clade III taxa differed. Furthermore, Xestospongia muta and Oceanapia sp. cluster in one
clade (IV) (including Amphimedon queenslandica).
Successive evolution of additional helices in marine
haplosclerids
Within haplosclerids, the evolution of additional helices
can be reconstructed by plotting structures to the wellsupported phylogenetic backbone (Fig. 6). Primary
sequences of these motifs were not included in the tree
construction (Fig. 5) due to ambiguous alignment, but
can be regarded as additional phylogenetic characters. The
helical insertions apparently evolved in at least two steps,
which fits the findings of the SSU rRNA gene tree strikingly well. The relationships within marine haplosclerids

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/69

can be described as four well-supported (PP > 0.97)
nested clades I-IV that display different stages of secondary structure evolution (see above and Figs. 5, 6). Clade I
contains all marine Haplosclerida. The basal diverging
taxa lack any large insertions that are typical for other
marine Haplosclerida. However, the predicted structure
within helix 43 differs from the standard structure in this
region found in other Porifera (compare outgroup in Fig.
6) and displays a larger bulge of unpaired bases at the
insertion point of the larger helical structures found
within all taxa in Clade II. This bulge may be the precursor
for the extensions at this position observed in Clade II.
Within basal diverging taxa of Clade II (i.e. Clade II without Clade III), a similar bulge is found for Xestospongia
muta in helix E23_14 at the insertion-site of subsequent
extensions in Clade III, but not the other sequences lacking E23_14.1.
Larger insertions appeared in helices E23_1 and 43 'simultaneously' (according to phylogenetic resolution recovered by our analyses) in the common ancestor of Clade II
taxa. The three taxa of Clade IV according to our minimum free energy calculations share an additional helix
43b.2 as synapomorphy (Figs. 4, 5, 6).
After the introduction of helical insertions in helices
E23_1 and 43, a long extension evolved within helix
E23_14 as a synapomorphy in Clade III. An autapomorphy for Dasychalina fragilis is an additional helix formed b
insertions within E23_1. Within the complete taxon of
marine haplosclerids, no loss of formerly gained additional helical insertions has been documented, therefore,
no SSU rRNA molecule from a descendent of a taxon with
extraordinary features has returned to the ancestral basic
metazoan core structure.

Discussion
Unusual patterns within poriferan SSU rRNA secondary
structure
We reported the secondary structures of a variety of poriferan SSU rRNA sequences, and suggest structure predictions for secondary structure motifs that are specific for
some lineages, i.e. marine Haplosclerida (= Haplosclerida
with the exception of members of the Spongillina) and
Hexactinellida. Such additional helical insertions occur in
a variety of eukaryotes and are known to be homoplasies,
because they occur in several, not closely related taxa [50].
Our data shows that such structures are also present in
early diverging Metazoa (sponges).

Insertions in helix E23_1 evolved independently in Hexactinellida and the marine Haplosclerida (Clade II),
which is evident (a) from our phylogenetic analyses that
captured 'snapshots' of the evolution of helices within the
marine Haplosclerida (Fig. 6) and (b) from the observa-

tions that insertions appear at different positions within
Helix E23_1 (compare Fig. 3 with Fig. 4). Although additional helical insertions are present within the E23-extension fragment in various eukaryotic taxa, to our
knowledge, none have been reported within helix
E23_14, which is therefore synapomorphic for Clade III
haplosclerids. Interestingly, helical insertions within haplosclerids first appeared in the typical regions for such
insertions, namely within helices E23_1 and 43, before
they evolved within E23_14 (see Fig. 6). Therefore, the
evolution of extensions at more common insertion sites
might be a prerequisite for the evolution of additional
helical structures within E23_14.
Higher Metazoa with unusual SSU rRNA structures also
contain unusual motifs in their large ribosomal subunit
(LSU, 28S), e.g., in branchiopod Crustacea [53]. In
sponges, additional motifs in a fragment of the LSU have
previously been reported for Hexactinellida and marine
haplosclerid demosponges [52], but not for non-haplosclerid demosponges or Calcarea. This is in striking
accordance with our SSU rRNA findings, and encourages
further studies of the complete LSU secondary structure of
these taxa. Since both rRNA units are encoded in one
translational unit, the same mechanisms may be responsible for the formation of extra helical features in both
rRNA molecules.
Remarkably, not only the nuclear rRNAs display unusual
secondary structure motifs in marine Haplosclerida. In the
recently published mitochondrial genome of the haplosclerid Amphimedon queenslandica, both of the mitochondrial (mt) rRNA genes (12S and 16SrRNA) also contain
additional helices that are not found in other demosponges [54]. Although this may be a coincidental observation and needs to be verified by data from additional
haplosclerid mt rRNA sequences, it is possible that the
same selection mechanisms act on the nuclear and mt
rRNA in this taxon. However, such correlations do not
exist in all taxa, since the recently sequenced mitochondrial genomes of Hexactinellida [55] contain extremely
short rRNAs (compared to the one found in Demospongiae), in contrast to the large insertions in the hexactinellid
nuclear rRNAs (e.g., see Fig. 3).
For the nuclear SSU rRNA, the fact that extra-helical structures are found in the E23-extension region and helix 43
in various taxa indicates that these regions are under less
functional constraints than are the core regions of SSU
rRNA; Wuyts et al. [50] showed by considering the tertiary
structure of rRNA that nucleotide variability increases
with distance from the ribosome centre. Eukaryotic insertion sites for additional helices are therefore located in the
same, or similar regions at the (3D-) periphery of rRNA
molecules. The authors concluded that these insertions do

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/69

not interfere with the ribosomal function of the ribosome
and can therefore arise independently within different lineages, similar to our observations in Hexactinellida and
marine haplosclerids.
Phylogenetic value of rRNA features
We demonstrated different applications of SSU rRNA features for phylogenetic analyses:
Base composition and synapomorphic base exchanges
Base compositions of SSU rRNA differ strikingly between
Demospongiae and Calcarea. The GC contents of the
(much more diverse) Demospongiae are always higher
and show a wider range of variability than the ones of Calcarea. For Hexactinellida, only five sequences were available (of which one is probably a non-functional copy),
therefore general conclusions regarding their GC contents
should be interpreted with care. However, for the few
sequences available the GC contents fell into the ranges
observed in Calcarea and Demospongiae.

Several apomorphic positions identified in calcarean SSU
rRNA allow to unambiguously distinguish between the
two subclasses Calcinea and Calcaronea, thus supporting
other morphological and molecular data [13,19,56,57].
RNA models for phylogeny estimation and evolution of additional
helical structures as evolutionary markers
The Bayesian phylogenetic reconstructions using structure-defined partitions with different rRNA models for
doublets in MrBayes 3.1.2 and PHASE 2 yielded very similar tree topologies with increased support for several
nodes compared to the Maximum Parsimony (MP) and
Maximum Likelihood (ML) analyses presented by Redmond et al. [41] (Fig. 5). Partitioned analyses using rRNA
models as applied in our analysis, have been reported to
result in better-supported topologies (for sponges:
[13,14]). However, other factors may have contributed to
our findings, e.g., it is known that Bayesian posterior
probability values are often higher than corresponding
nonparametric bootstrap values and may even provide
support for the 'wrong' clades in studies with simulated
data [58]. The relevant important haplosclerid clades were
supported with very high PP values (> 97%). These high
values should overcome eventual problems of support
overestimation. Also, support for 'wrong' clades is
unlikely to be a problem in our results, since the topologies from Redmond et al. [41] are mostly concordant with
ours. Regarding the general differences in bootstrap and
PP values, the different software packages used and the
difference in the data set (taxon sampling, alignment and
included sites) may have contributed to the higher support found for several clades.

Although standard models of nucleotide evolution violate
the assumption of independent evolution of all sites
when also applied to paired sites as done by Redmond et
al. [41], this seems to have little impact on nodes with
high support values in the case of the demosponge dataset
studied (compare Fig. 1 in [41] with our Fig. 5). This suggests that the biases introduced by the use of less well fitting 'standard' rRNA models may have a higher impact on
clades that are difficult to resolve (e.g., due to noisy data),
whereas a strong phylogenetic signal will be recovered
even if a sub-optimal evolutionary model is used for analyses.
Amphimedon queenslandica, the target of the Sponge
Genome Sequencing project, did not cluster with any
other representative of its Family Niphatidae. Likewise,
neither the other haplosclerid families (Callyspongiidae,
Chalinidae, Petrosiidae, Phloeodictyidae), nor the genera
(Callyspongia, Haliclona, Petrosia) could be recovered as
monophyletic, (besides of the genus Petrosia) in accordance with the SSU-rRNA based findings of Redmond et al.
[41]. Strikingly, these inferred relationships are supported
by the presence or absence of secondary structure motifs
within Haplosclerida: different members of the families
Niphatidae, Petrosiidae and Phloeodictyidae show a different number of specific insertions that are congruent
with the phylogenetic relationships that we previously
inferred without the inclusion of these extended regions
(see Figs. 5, 6). The presence and absence of such helices
are therefore good phylogenetic indicators for these relatively closely related taxa, even though alignment of the
primary sequence of these helices (and cladistic or phenetic sequence analysis) between all taxa is difficult due to
high evolutionary rates. Homology inference of sites in
hypervariable regions according to their secondary structure is known to be problematic. Functional constraints
are probably more relaxed in these regions, and the
observed evolution of insertions is driven by unknown
mutational mechanisms, which might tend to produce
similar motifs by homoplasy [59]. In contrast, within
marine haplosclerids, no loss of helical insertions that
arose at some earlier point of their evolutionary history
occurred (Fig. 6). Furthermore, no independent homoplasic helical insertions ever appeared in the same positions
within SSU rRNA. Considering our findings, the presence
and absence of large helical insertions appears to provide
strong phylogenetic information at selected taxonomical
levels.
A similar phylogenetic information value of additional
helical structures may be present for insertions in Helix
E23_1 of Hexactinellida, although generalized conclusions are limited by the small sample size. Nonetheless,
the insertions in Hexasterophora (Acanthascus, Oopsacas,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/69

Aphrocallistes, and Farrea) are predicted to possess two
additional helices, while the insertion found in the only
considered amphidiscophoran, Semperella schulzei, forms
only one helix (Fig. 3). It is evident that integration of secondary structure information in sequence alignment and
analyses (in the form of rRNA substitution models) will
optimize rRNA phylogenies considerably.

Conclusion
The SSU rRNA provides far more valuable phylogenetic
information than just its primary sequence. Even simple
features like base composition already bear enough information to distinguish between the two higher sponge taxa
Calcarea and Demospongiae (Fig. 1). Unusual secondary
structures can lend further support to results from independent phylogenetic inferences, as we showed for helical
insertions in marine haplosclerid demosponges (Fig. 6)
and for a small number of hexactinellid sponges (Fig. 3).
In this way, otherwise neglected hypervariable insertions
can yield further support to a given topology. Although we
only explored additional structures of SSU rRNA in
sponges, our results should encourage further studies.
Especially the study of LSU rRNA structure seems promising in this regard, since this gene is more variable than
SSU rRNA and contains large extension regions that
strongly differ among higher taxa [60]. On the intraspecific level, the even more variable internal transcribed
spacer regions (ITS 1 and ITS 2) can provide secondary
structure features of phylogenetic value (e.g. [61]). Relating secondary structure to sequence information will
allow the phylogenetic signal of the huge numbers of
rRNA sequences currently available in Genbank to be considerably increased. Our newly generated database of Porifera SSU rRNA secondary structures will facilitate the
inclusion of secondary structure information in phylogenetic analyses.
