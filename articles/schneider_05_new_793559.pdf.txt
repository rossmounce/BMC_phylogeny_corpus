Abstract
Background: Malaria caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium spp. is a major health
burden in tropical countries. The development of new control tools, including vaccines and drugs,
is urgently needed. The availability of genome sequences from several malaria parasite species
provides a basis on which to identify new potential intervention targets. Database mining for
orthologs to the Plasmodium falciparum trophozoite protein R45, a vaccine candidate, led us identify
a new gene family.
Results: Orthologs to the P. falciparum trophozoite protein R45 were detected exclusively in
protozoan parasites of the phylum Apicomplexa, including several Plasmodium spp., Toxoplasma gondii
and Cryptosporidium parvum. All family members are hybrid genes with a conserved C-terminal
protein kinase domain of a novel type, recently called FIKK kinase, associated with a non conserved
N-terminal region without any known functional signature. While a single copy gene was detected
in most species, considerable gene expansion was observed in P. falciparum and its closest
phylogenic relative P. reichenowi, with 20 and six copies, respectively, each with a distinct N-terminal
domain. Based on full length protein sequence, pairs of orthologs were observed in closely related
species, such as P. berghei and P.y. yoelii, P. vivax and P. knowlesi, or P. reichenowi and P. falciparum. All
20 P. falciparum paralogs possess a canonical Plasmodium export element downstream of a signal /
anchor sequence required for exportation outside the parasitophorous vacuole. This is consistent
with the reported association of the trophozoite protein R45, the only paralog characterised to
date, with the infected red blood cell membrane. Interestingly, most genes are located in the
subtelomeric region of chromosomes, in association with other multigene families contributing to
the remodelling of the infected red blood cell membrane, in particular the ring erythrocyte surface
antigen multigene family.
Conclusion: This Apicomplexan-specific gene family was called R45-FIKK kinase. The family
hallmark is a kinase domain with unusual characteristics, raising the possibility of designing drug or
vaccine strategies targeting this domain. The characteristics of the P. falciparum family suggest a role
in remodelling the infected cell and as such possibly contribute to the particular virulence of this
species.

Background
Plasmodium spp. are protozoan parasites (phylum Apicomplexa, class Sporozoa, order Haemosporida) with a complex
life cycle, including alternating development phases in
mosquito and vertebrate hosts. More than a hundred Plasmodium species have been described, of which four infect
humans and cause malaria. The genome sequences of the
most pathogenic human species, P. falciparum [1], and of
P. yoelii yoelii, a murine malaria species [2], were published in 2002. Sequencing of additional Plasmodium species is underway. Recently, the genome of Cryptosporidium
parvum another Apicomplexan parasite has been published [3], while the genome of Toxoplasma gondii is being
sequenced. The body of information available offers new
opportunities in malaria research, and will hopefully
accelerate rational design of novel intervention strategies,
a pressing need in view of the rapidly deteriorating efficiency of existing control tools.
In recent years, our laboratory has explored the vaccine
potential of the trophozoite protein R45, a P. falciparum
antigen exported by the parasite to the infected red blood
cell membrane [4]. The protein contains a large central
domain with 90 copies of a HK/MSDH/SN consensus hexapeptide, encoded by the gene annotated as PFD1175w in
the P. falciparum genome [1]. We have shown that a
recombinant antigen called R23, which contains 11 such
repeats is the target of antibodies promoting phagocytosis
of parasitized red blood cells [5] and induces strong protective immunity against lethal infection in Saimiri sciureus squirrel monkeys [6-8]. Furthermore, the response to
R23 repeats is associated with protection against clinical
malaria in humans [9]. The PFD1175w gene sequence is
well conserved among all isolates of P. falciparum studied
so far. In order to obtain information on the organisational and expression constraints of the antigen, we carried out a comparative genomic approach. This showed
that the N-terminal region and the central hexapeptide
repeats were P. falciparum-specific and unique to
PFD1175w. In contrast, multiple paralogs of the C-terminal region were identified in P. falciparum and a single
ortholog in most other Plasmodium species as well as in
some distantly related Apicomplexan species. This C-terminal region is predicted to be a protein kinase domain
[4], with high divergence from all other known kinase
domains. We describe here some characteristics by this
novel gene family and of this novel kinase domain, and
discuss the possible relevance of species-specific gene
amplification.

Results
Identification of R45 paralogs in P. falciparum
The R45 trophozoite protein (PFD1175w) has a predicted
three-exon structure, with a small (201 bp) exon 1, a large
(3387 bp) exon 2 followed by a short (78 bp) exon 3.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/30

Gene structure and exon / intron boundaries were experimentally confirmed by cDNA sequencing (data not
shown). Based on homology with PFD1175w, a gene family with 20 paralogs was identified in the genome of the
3D7 clone of P. falciparum. Data mining indicated that all
20 paralogs are transcribed at a stage or another of the life
cycle, and for many members at multiple stages (Figure 1)
[16,17]. Twelve genes were re-annotated to fit with the
gene structure and amino acid sequence of the other paralogs (see Materials and Methods). All genes have a three
exon structure with a large exon 2 flanked by two small
exons, except Mal7P1.175, where the small exon 1
appears to be missing (or fused to exon 2) (Figure 1). Two
paralogs (Mal7P1.175 and PF14_0733+4) have an internal stop codon, reflecting pseudogenes or need for read
through translation [18].
The hallmark of the family is a conserved C-terminal
domain showing 38 – 64 % identity among the paralogs,
with its terminal 24 – 41 residues encoded by the small
exon 3 [exon 2 in Mal7P1.175] (Figure 1). This conserved
domain has characteristic features of protein kinases, but
can not be assigned to any known kinase family. The presence of all amino acids necessary for phosphotransfer
except the canonical ATP fixation motif GxGxxG in all 20
paralogs [see Additional file 1] suggests a novel protein
kinase type. This is consistent with the conclusions of
Ward et al, who independently identified this protein
kinase family, that was called FIKK-kinase, using a whole
genome search for protein kinases in P. falciparum [19].
Two members contain a repeat region inserted between
subdomains III and IV consisting of 90 copies of the H K
S/N D N/H/S N hexapeptide in PFD1175w and of 32 copies of the two amino acid motif NE/G in PFI0125. The
other family members contain a stretch of up to 53 nonconserved and non-repeated amino acids in this region, as
illustrated in Figure 1.
Contrasting with the conserved C-terminal kinase
domain, the N-terminal region is unique to each paralog,
with less than 20% identity and substantial size variation
(ranging from 124 residues for PFI0100c to 471 residues
for PF10_0380). Homology and motif searches for each
unique N-terminal region did not identify any known
Pfam domain or a significant homology with any other P.
falciparum protein. However, all twenty paralogs contain a
stretch of hydrophobic amino acids within the first 70
amino acids, corresponding to a predicted trans-membrane or signal sequence for 14 members according to
PlasmoDB. Analysis of the re-annotated paralogs using an
improved signal peptide prediction algorithm [10] and
manual curation identified a likely signal / anchor
sequence in all but one paralogs (Figure 1). For PFI0100c,
there was no signal / anchor sequence probability but
there was a trans-membrane prediction. We considered

here as a possible signal / anchor sequence that might
have escaped detection by the algorithms used. The secretion motif RxSRILAExxx identified recently [20] was
present in six paralogs (PFD1165w, PFI0105c,
PF10_0160, PFL0040c, MAL13P1.109, PF14_0733+4).

Interestingly however, the shorter Plasmodium export element (Pexel) identified independently by Marti et al [21]
was detected in all paralogs downstream of the signal /
anchor sequence (Figure 1) [see Additional file 2]. The
consensus (R,K) × (L,I) × (E,Q,D) pentamer was observed

in 18 paralogs. A non-canonical amino acid in the fifth
position was found in PFI0095c and PFI00105c (A and V,
respectively). The Pexel motif is located 16–24 amino
acids downstream of the start of the second exon, except
in Mal7P1.175, where it is 11 residues downstream of the
signal sequence. Pf11_510 has two putative Pexel motifs
located at positions 20–24 and 44–48.
R45-FIKK kinase orthologs in other Plasmodium species
and in other Apicomplexans
Orthologs were identified in most Plasmodium genome
sequences available to date. A single copy gene was
observed in the human species P. vivax (PvR45), the simian species P. knowlesi (PkR45), the murine species P.y.
yoelii (PyR45) and P. berghei (PbR45), and the avian species P. gallinacaeum (PgR45). In contrast, six paralogs were
identified in P. reichenowi (PrR45-1-6). No ortholog was
identified in the murine species P. chabaudi, possibly
reflecting the low coverage (2×) of the available genome
sequence.

The deduced protein sequence alignment showed the
FIKK-protein kinase domain to be well conserved within
the genus [see Additional file 1]. None of the non P. falciparum orthologs identified here contain any repeat region.
Based on their kinase domain, the R45-FIKK kinase proteins from six Plasmodium species, namely PvR45, PkR45,
PyR45, PbR45, PgR45 and PrR45-2, clustered perfectly in
a phylogenetic tree with 82 – 98 % identity (Figure 2),
suggesting that they derive from the same common ancestor. Intriguingly, no P. falciparum R45-like protein was
observed in this cluster. The best match, Pf10_0160,
showed a non-significant bootstrap of 44. The six R45-like
orthologs of the core cluster are quite distinct from the P.
falciparum R45-FIKK genes with regard to their gene structure and N-terminal region (Figure 3a) [see Additional file
3]. They have a two exon structure. The short, highly conserved second exon is the ortholog of the conserved third
P. falciparum exon. All genes lack an ortholog of the first P.
falciparum exon and hence encode a protein without a signal sequence and a Pexel motif. In addition, the N-terminal region is much larger than for any P. falciparum
paralog, ranging from 1060 residues in PkR45 to 759 residues in PrR45-2. Interestingly, analysis of the N-terminal
region identified pairs of orthologs, with 56 % identity
between PvR45 and PkR45, and 82 % identity between
PyR45 and PbR45 (Figure 3a). These pairs form two quite
separate homology groups, with less than 20 % overall
inter-group identity. Despite of the low overall conservation, stretches of conserved amino acids are present
within the 200 downstream residues of the N-terminal
region [see Additional file 3]. These motifs are not
observed in any P. falciparum ortholog [see Additional file
2].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/30

P. reichenowi, like P. falciparum, has multiple R45-FIKK
kinase paralogs. As indicated above, PrR45-2, clusters
with the orthologs from the single copy species and does
not have an ortholog in the 3D7 P. falciparum genome.
Interestingly however, the five other P. reichenowi paralogs
could each be attributed to a specific P. falciparum R45FIKK kinase paralog (Figure 3b), forming orthologous
pairs as follows: PrR45-1 – PF10_380, PrR45-3 – PFI0110,
PrR45-4 – Mal7P1.144, PrR45-5 – PFC0060, PrR45-6 –
PFI0125. For those P. reichenowi paralogs were enough
sequence data was available, there was remarkable conservation of both the kinase domain (87 – 97 % identity with
the respective P. falciparum ortholog) and the N-terminal
region (75–91 % idem). Interestingly, the two P. reichenowi orthologs with full length sequence available, PrR453 and PrR45-4, share the 3 exon structure with their P. falciparum orthologs, have an exon 1-encoded signal
sequence and a conserved Pexel sequence close to the start
of exon 2. Progress in the P. reichenowi genome should
indicate whether or not the other orthologs present the
same structure so far observed only in P. falciparum and P.
reichenowi.
A single copy R45-like ortholog was identified in T. gondii
(TgR45) as well as in C. parvum (CpR45), two parasite species that belong to a distinct class, namely Coccidea, within
the phylum Apicomplexa. Their deduced amino acid
sequence is quite divergent from the Plasmodium spp. family members (Additional file 1 and 2). The protein kinase
domain of CpR45 and TgR45 shows 41 – 42 % and 31 –
33 % identity, respectively, with the cluster of orthologs.
The lower value for TgR45 is explained by insertions of
stretches of amino acids between some subdomains. The
gene structure of TgR45 and CpR45 differs considerably
from their orthologs in the various Plasmodium spp. TgR45
is encoded by a minimum of seven exons, with possible
additional upstream exons. While the seventh exon corresponds to the third exon of the P. falciparum paralogs, the
remaining kinase domain is encoded by six exons. A signal sequence is predicted within the first 21 amino acids
of TgR45, but not followed by a Pexel motif. The significance of this finding is unclear, because the actual start of
the TgR45coding region is not yet identified. In contrast,
in line with the general paucity of introns in the C. parvum
genome, CpR45 is encoded by a single exon [3]. The C-terminal amino acids encoded by a specific exon in all the
other orthologs are present and well conserved in CpR45.
Chromosome localisation in P. falciparum
The 20 P. falciparum paralogs are distributed over 11 chromosomes. Interestingly, 17 of 20 R45-FIKK kinase paralogs are located within 150 kb from their telomer, all with
the sense of transcription directed towards the telomer
(Figure 4). Seven of these paralogs are single copy on their
respective chromosome. A cluster of seven head to tail

parologs is located on chromosome 9, and two paralogs
are separated by a single gene on chromosome 4. Chromosomes 7 and 10 have two paralogs, one in the sub-telomeric region and one in the central region.
Chromosome 13 has a single centrally located gene.
Interestingly, the subtelomeric R45-FIKK kinase paralogs
are consistently associated with paralogs from other multigene families with a predominant subtelomeric localisation. The most frequent association (15 of 17 R45-FIKK
kinase subtelomeric paralogs) is with the ortholog group
named 775394, which contains proteins with a DNA J
domain, in particular, the ring erythrocyte surface antigens (resa 1–3). There seems to be a close association

between both families as in most cases the 775394 paralog is the closest or the next closest gene to a R45-FIKK
paralog. For instance, PFD1165w and PFD1175w, which
are located 80 kb from the chromosome 4 telomer, are
each flanked in 3' by a 775394 paralog. Likewise,
PF11_0510 is located between the resa2 and resa3 paralogs on chromosome 11. PFA0130c is located further
apart from resa1, but still is closely linked (less than 20 kb
downstream of resa1). Approximately half of the 27 paralogs within the 775394 group are localised close to a R45FIKK kinase gene. Additional subtelomeric gene families
in the close vicinity of a R45-FIKK paralog include the
76615 (lysophospholipase), 779237 (erythrocyte binding
antigens eba and ebl), 766147 (fatty acid CoA synthase) as

well as several multigene families coding for hypothetical
transmembrane proteins (see Figure 4). There are several
examples of specific tandem arrangements such as resa,
R45-like, eba (see Figure 4), suggesting an ancient higher
order organisation.
C. parvum is the only other Apicomplexan for which chromosome maps have been established [3]. CpR45 (annotated cgd5_4390) is located approx. 35 kb from the
putative telomer on chromosome 5 [3], but does not seem
to be associated with any specific subtelomeric family. In
P.y. yoelii, the R45-FIKK ortholog is not present in a subtelomeric or telomeric contig [2], but the exact chromosomal localisation is unfortunately neither known for this
species nor for other Plasmodium species, since at this stage

of genome annotation and assembly, chromosome maps
are quite incomplete. A partial synteny map has been
established for some regions of the P.y. yoelii and P. falciparum chromosomes. Interestingly enough, many R45FIKK kinase paralogs lie at the boundary of the subtelomeric region where both species diverge substantially and as
such correspond to breakpoint in synteny. We looked systematically for P.y. yoelii orthologs in the vicinity of the
various R45-FIKK kinase paralogs. We observed break of
synteny close to all telomeric paralogs, confirming observations by other authors [2]. In particular the synteny
reported for the P.y. yoelii chromosome 5 and P. falciparum
4 stops close to the localisation of PFD1165w [2]. We also
observed breaks of synteny close to internal R45-FIKK paralogs, in particular downstream of the internal gene

Chromosomal localisation of R45-FIKK kinase genes and of some associated multigene families in the P. falciparum 3D7
genome, as deduced from the maps published by Gardner et al [1] and the version 4.3 genome annotation from PlasmoDB.
The genes transcribed leftwards (annotated "c" in the 3D7 genome) are placed above the chromosome. The genes transcribed
rightwards (annotated "w" in the 3D7 genome) are placed beneath the chromosome. Total chromosome length as deduced
from PlasmoDB (as per December 2004) is given in megabases on the right. Note that for chromosomes whose sequence is
still incomplete, the actual chromosome size is slightly larger. The subtelomeric regions are not drawn to scale.

MAL13P1.109, which is still uncertain. Interestingly, the
P. vivax contig that harbours PvR45 also contains a break
in synteny with P. falciparum.

Discussion
The family identified here on the basis of similarity with
the non repeated regions from PFD1175w groups genes

coding for a well conserved C-terminal protein kinase
domain. Recently, Ward et al identified the same family
using a whole genome mining for protein kinases. Based
on a conserved motif from sub-domain II, they named
this family "FIKK-like kinase" [19]. Since the kinase activity has not been formally demonstrated, and since the
only paralog characterised in some detail so far is R45
(PFD1175w) [4-9], we prefer to name it the R45-FIKK
kinase family.

The R45-FIKK family was observed only in protozoan parasites of the phylum Apicomplexa. A single copy gene was
detected in most species except in P. falciparum and its
closest relative P. reichenowi, where multiple copies were
observed. As current genome coverage is ≥ 10× for C. parvum [3], P. vivax and T. gondii, 5× for P. yoelii [2] and P.
knowlesi, the conclusion of a low (single) copy number is
a fair statement. Due to incomplete coverage of the P.
berghei, P. gallinacaeum and P. chabaudi genome sequence
(2–3×), a definitive conclusion on the actual copy
number in these species cannot be drawn, but a large copy
number is highly unlikely. Conversely, copy number in P.
reichenowi may be underestimated. Indeed, six copies have
been detected in the available P. reichenowi sequence, currently only at 1.5× coverage. Additional copies might be
uncovered upon completion of genome sequence.
The kinase domain is well conserved in all family members identified. It has many features of a catalytic protein
kinase domain. The limited homology with well characterised kinase domains from other species precludes predicting a possible kinase type and phosphorylation target.
This is in line with the observation that protozoan parasites such as Plasmodium spp., T. gondii and C. parvum have
a quite different kinase repertoire as compared to yeast
and metazoa [19,22]. The fact that all residues essential
for phosphotransfer are present in each kinase domain of
the R45-FIKK kinase family suggests that these proteins
function as protein kinases. These observations call for
experimental investigation of the potential enzymatic
activity of the R45-like proteins, the uniqueness of which
could represent an attractive drug or vaccine target.
The N-terminal region is much less conserved than the
kinase domain but interestingly, clear ortholog pairs with
very good conservation were identified. Clustering of the
two rodent species P. berghei and P. yoelii, of the human P.
vivax and simian P. knowlesi and of P. falciparum and P.
reichenowi is in line with the phylogeny inferred from
rRNA and CSP gene sequences [23,24]. The N-terminal
domain of the R45-FIKK kinases may thus serve as a sensitive marker for genetic distance within the Plasmodium
genus.
The conservation of the C-terminal FIKK-kinase domain
and the restricted conservation of the N-terminal domain
points to a hybrid gene, with individual components
evolving at distinct rates. Evolution of the kinase domain
may be constrained in order to retain enzymatic activity.
In contrast, the high divergence of N-terminal regions
among R45-like protein orthologs in distant species might
reflect different (species- or host-specific) interaction partners and / or their possible implication in distinct biological processes or distinct stages of the life cycle. The
sequence variation between the various P. falciparum and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/30

P. reichenowi paralogs is another sign of the rapid evolution of this gene family. The observation that none of the
20 P. falciparum R45-FIKK kinase genes clustered with the
"core" group of orthologs from the other Plasmodium species may be related to this rapid divergence rate. Alternatively, it may merely reflect absence of this family member
from the 3D7 genome, which presents several large subtelomeric deletions and may lack the "core" ortholog. The
ongoing sequencing of additional P. falciparum lines will
clarify this issue.
PFD1175w, the trophozoite protein R45 that led us initiate this analysis, turned out to be a quite unusual family
member in that it contains a large repeat region absent
from all other R45-like proteins. PFD1175w clusters with
the orthologous pair PrR45-1 – PF10_0380, suggesting
that it originates from duplication of the latter after speciation, and has subsequently acquired the repeat region.
This is the first evidence of such a process in malaria parasites. PFI0125c, which also contains a specific repeat
region, clusters with a different P. reichenowi paralog,
namely PrR45-6. Both PrR45-1 and PrR45-6 are devoid of
repeats. Thus, in both cases, acquisition of repeats was P.
falciparum-specific and posterior to the P. reichenowi /P.
falciparum branching. Interestingly, the repeats are
anchored within a gene region that shows substantial
intra-family sequence polymorphism. This gene family
thus represents a unique opportunity to analyse the genesis and possible evolution of these intriguing low complexity sequences in P. falciparum parasites. Indeed, we
have observed considerable variation in the copy number
of the PFD1175w hexapeptide repeats in field isolates
(Schneider et al, unpublished).
P. falciparum and P. reichenowi present an expanded set of
R45-FIKK kinase genes, which furthermore have unique
structural features. The genes have a three exon structure
and encode a protein with canonical export signatures
(signal / anchor sequence preceding a Pexel motif). This
was observed in all twenty P. falciparum paralogs and in
the P. reichenowi paralogs for which full length coding
sequence could be retrieved. No such export signature was
observed in any of the other orthologs from the family.
Presence of a signal sequence associated with a
downstream Pexel motif is necessary and sufficient for
exportation of the protein beyond the parasitophorous
vacuole [21]. This suggests that all 20 P. falciparum paralogs have the capacity to be exported beyond the parasitophorous vacuole membrane. The available mRNA
expression profiling indicates that all 20 paralogs are transcribed by blood stages and that seven are also transcribed
in sporozoites [16,17]. Evidence for protein expression
was obtained for some paralogs by mass spectroscopy at
the trophozoite and / or sporozoite stage [25]. Absence of
protein detection must be interpreted with caution,

Page 8 of 12

BMC Genomics 2005, 6:30

because it may reflect low abundance of the protein in
question at the developmental stage investigated.
PFD1175w, the only paralog characterised to date is
exported to the red blood cell membrane at the early trophozoite stage [5,6]. Immunisation of Saimiri monkeys
with a recombinant protein derived from its central repeat
region resulted in either complete protection or in selection of parasite mutants that no longer expressed red
blood cell surface variant antigens [6]. It is tempting to
speculate that the R45 trophozoite antigen is involved in
some sort of signalling cascade, and by extrapolation that
the other family members are implicated in signalling
from the extracellular / extravacuolar milieu as well.
Interestingly, most P. falciparum R45-FIKK kinase paralogs
are located in the subtelomeric regions that harbour
numerous multigene families that code for proteins destined to be exported to the host cellular membrane or host
cytoplasm [1,20,21]. The telomeric and subtelomeric
regions of Plasmodium spp. harbour several multigene families that code for products involved in antigenic variation
[1,2]. Remarkably enough, these multigene families differ
markedly in P. falciparum as compared to P.y. yoelii [2].
Nine telomeric / subtelomeric multigene families have
been identified in P.y. yoelii. Four of them, namely the yir
or vir or the pystb-d families have no ortholog in the 3D7
genome, while the others are either expanded or contracted as compared to P. falciparum [2]. Similarly, the telomeric var, rif and stevor P. falciparum multigene families
do not have orthologs in P.y. yoelii [2] or P. vivax [26]. Our
observation of a markedly different copy number of R45FIKK kinase genes in P. falciparum as compared to P.y. yoelii or P. vivax is in line with distinct sets of subtelomeric
multigene families in different Plasmodium species. This is
further substantiated by the observation that the P. falciparum R45-FIKK kinase genes are situated at or close to
subtelomeric breakpoints of synteny between P. falciparum and P. yoelii [2]. The association of most R45-FIKK
kinase telomeric paralogs with a DNA J / resa paralog and
with additional paralogs from families coding for
exported hypothetical membrane proteins or proteins
involved in lipid metabolism suggests a structured complex interacting with and signalling from the host cell
membrane. It is possible that different subtelomeric gene
families execute this function in species such as such as P.
vivax, P. knowlesi or P.y. yoelli that do not possess the specific adhesion properties associated with expression of
erythrocyte variant antigens observed in P. falciparum.

Conclusion
The new R45-FIKK kinase gene family codes for hybrid
proteins with a variable N-terminal domain associated
with a conserved, novel protein kinase domain. The presence of most key amino acids for phosphotransfer and the
remarkable sequence conservation suggest an enzymatic

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/30

function. The restricted occurrence of R45-like genes in
Apicomplexan parasites and the distance from known
kinase families makes a case for consideration of this family as a potential drug or vaccine target. The family shows
considerable expansion in P. falciparum. All paralogs code
for proteins with canonical export signals and most are
subtelomeric, clustered with a subset of multigene families coding for exported proteins. This suggests that expansion of this family might contribute to P. falciparum
virulence.

Methods
Retrieval of homologous sequences in P. falciparum
The deduced protein sequence of PFD1175w was used for
a tblastn search against the P. falciparum annotated proteins in the PlasmoDB database version 4, and verified for
version 4.3 for which genome coverage is 18× http://plas
modb.org. (Note that PFD1175w has been annotated as
R45 trophozoite-like antigen in the genome sequence,
whereas PF10_0160w, a paralog without repeats was
annotated as trophozoite antigen R45 [1]. This is inappropriate, since the only gene that encodes the hexapeptidic
repeats originally described for the gene named R45 by
Bonnefoy et al [4] is PFD1175w. The PFD1175w repeat
region alone did not yield any significant hit apart from
PFD1175w either by blasting the whole repeat region or
by scanning a single repeat motif against the database.
Blasting the PFD1175w protein sequence without repeats,
however, resulted in identifying 20 additional annotated
proteins with high homology from amino acid 248 up to
the end of the ORF, with E-values ranging from 6.8e-109
for PF10_0160 to 2.6e-28 for PFC0060c, with the next
best hit down to 7.3e-05.

The primary structure of the R45-like proteins was verified
by comparing and aligning the prediction alternatives
made by GlimmerM, Genefinder and FullPhat (PlasmoDB). Sequences were used as annotated in PlasmoDB
for the following 8 proteins: PFD1165w, PFD1175w,
PFE0045c, PFI0100c, PFI0110c, PFI0120c, PFI0125c,
PF10_0380. For PFI0105c, PFI0115c and MAL13P1.109,
preference was given to the alternative sequence prediction chr.9 glm31, chr9.glm33 and chr13phat_225, respectively, that includes the 3rd exon that is highly conserved
in all other R45-like protein paralogs. For PF10_0160, the
alternative sequence prediction chr10gen334 was preferred, because the boundary between exon 2 and 3
resulted in a perfect alignment with other family members, whereas the annotated version aligned with gaps. For
PFA0130c,
PFC0060c,
Mal7P1.175,
PFI0095c,
PF11_0510 and PFL0040c, preference was given to the
chr1.glm_35,
chr3.glm_19,
chr7.glm_316
and
chr9.glm_29, chr11.glm_542 and chr12.glm_14 predictions respectively, because they include a signal sequence
to the putative N-terminal domain. For Mal7P1.144, a 5'

exon was predicted manually resulting in a three exon
protein with an N-terminal signal sequence. Mal7P1.175
(chr7.glm_316) was manually curated by fusing the first
two exons and considering the intron sequence as coding.
This allowed a perfect alignment with its paralogs,
although including one internal stop codon. Likewise, the
two tandem chromosome 14 genes, annotated
PF14_0733 and PF14_0734, were fused together, referred
to as PF14_0733+4, resulting in one full R45-like protein
interrupted by one stop codon. The identical asexual stage
mRNA expression pattern of both genes (DeRisi Lab
Malaria Transcriptome Database http://malaria.ucsf.edu/
index.php) strongly suggests that they indeed form a single transcription unit. The gene names for all paralogs but
PF14_0733+4 were kept as annotated by PlasmoDB, even
when an alternative prediction was preferred, resulting in
a total of 20 R45-like proteins in the 3D7 P. falciparum
genome. Signal sequences were predicted using the signalP 3.0 server [10].
Note that MAL13P1.109 and the flanking two genes were
no longer retrieved from the PlasmoDB version 4.3
released November 2004. Since the reason for this is
unclear, we decided to keep including this gene within the
family described here.
Retrieval of R45-like genes from other Plasmodium
species, T. gondii and C. parvum
R45-like protein orthologs from other species were identified using a tblastn search of the protein kinase domain of
PFD1175w against the genomic sequences of all Plasmodium species in PlasmoDB. This identified six highly
matching contigs (E- value <10 exp 40) as follows:
Pg_c000319933.Contig1
from
P.
gallinacaeum,
Pk_2154b11q1c from P. knowlesi, Pv_4038 from P. vivax,
chrPyl_00951 from P.y. yoelii, Pb_5155 from P. berghei
and Pr_4e04q1k from P. reichenowi. The same tblastn
search was also repeated in the genomic databases from
the
Wellcome
Trust
Sanger
Institute
http://
www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects for P. berghei, P. knowlesi, P.
gallinacaeum and P. reichenowi sequences and the Institute
for Genomic Research http://www.tigr.org/tdb for P. vivax
and P. yoelii sequences. Contigs with the identical
sequence information as those obtained from PlasmoDB
were obtained for five species, however six highly matching hits were retrieved in the P. reichenowi genomic database. No hits were obtained by blasting against other
protozoan parasites in the above mentioned resources.
The T. gondii contig TGG994720 was retrieved from the
Toxoplasma Database [ToxoDB, release 3.0, http://tox
odb.org/] and the C. parvum contig AAEE01000010.1 was
retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology
Information http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. BlastP analysis of PFD1175w against the NRprot database did not give
a hit in any additional species.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/30

R45-like orthologs were predicted as follows: the C. parvum ortholog annotated as EAK87586.1 [3] was named
CpR45. The gene model proposed for the P.y. yoelii
ortholog [2] was modified. The two genes annotated as
Py03325 and Py03326 which are separated because of a
one nucleotide frameshift were fused to one gene and
named PyR45. The resulting two exon structure with most
of the sequence encoded by exon 1 and the conserved
exon 2 (corresponding to exon 3 in the P. falciparum
orthologs) is supported by the EST data. Two exon
orthologs in P. vivax, P. knowlesi, P. berghei, P. gallinacaeum
(PvR45, PkR45, PbR45 and PgR45) were predicted
accordingly.
Six R45-like proteins were identified in P. reichenowi
(PrR45-1 to 6) from contigs 3502696.c000125078,
c000024654, c000125213, c000126950, c000124557,
c000128208, respectively. Their very close homology to
specific orthologs in one or the other species was
exploited to predict their exon-intron boundaries. The T.
gondii R45-like protein, TgR45 was predicted using the
overlapping ESTs TgEST_95056840, TgEST_100112765,
TgEST_95056367. The N-terminal exon(s) are not yet
identified.
The databases were last checked for the presence of new
hits by December 9, 2004. By then, the genome of P.y. yoelii was as published in 2002, namely with 5× coverage and
short contigs [2], the genome of C. parvum was published
with 13× coverage and 1–3 large contigs per chromosome
[3]. Genome sequence of the other species was in
progress, with mostly short contigs and the following coverage rates: T. gondii (10×), P. vivax (10×), P. knowlesi (5×),
P. berghei (3×), P. gallinacaeum (3×) and P. reichenowi
(1.5×).
Analysis of chromosomal organisation in P. falciparum
and possible synteny with other species
Analysis of the genes localised within 40 kb on either side
of the various R45-like paralogs was done using the published chromosomal maps [1] and the PlasmoDB version
4.3 annotation. Ortholog groups were systematically
looked for each gene, and sequence alignments inspected.
For each family, only paralogs with high homology along
>60% of the sequence were considered. In case a P.y. yoelli
ortholog was present, the neighbouring genes were analysed for possible synteny groups with P. falciparum. The
same was done for the P. vivax genes located within contig
Pv_4038.
Sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree
The conserved regions of all R45-like proteins were
aligned by ClustalW [11] using the matrix PAM30 and
adjusted manually where necessary. Four well characterised catalytic domains of protein kinases, namely protein

kinase A (PkA), Jun-kinase 1 (Junk1), fibroblast growth
factor receptor 1 (Figure 1) and extracellular regulated
kinase 1 (ERK1) were used as a scaffold for the alignment
of R45-like proteins to the 12 subdomains as provided in
http://pkr.sdsc.edu/html/classification.shtml[12]. The P.
falciparum protein kinase 5 (PfPk5), the only Plasmodium
protein kinase which has been thus far structurally characterised, was included as an additional reference protein
kinase [13]. For the phylogenetic tree, the kinase domains
of 32 R45-FIKK proteins were taken and gaps between the
subdomains were removed. Phylogenetic relationships
were inferred by the neighbour joining method [14] with
the T. gondii protein TgR45 as outgroup. The reliability of
the trees was assessed by the bootstrap method [15].
