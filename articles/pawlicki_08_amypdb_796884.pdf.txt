Abstract
Background: Misfolding and aggregation of proteins into ordered fibrillar structures is associated
with a number of severe pathologies, including Alzheimer's disease, prion diseases, and type II
diabetes. The rapid accumulation of knowledge about the sequences and structures of these
proteins allows using of in silico methods to investigate the molecular mechanisms of their abnormal
conformational changes and assembly. However, such an approach requires the collection of
accurate data, which are inconveniently dispersed among several generalist databases.
Results: We therefore created a free online knowledge database (AMYPdb) dedicated to amyloid
precursor proteins and we have performed large scale sequence analysis of the included data.
Currently, AMYPdb integrates data on 31 families, including 1,705 proteins from nearly 600
organisms. It displays links to more than 2,300 bibliographic references and 1,200 3D-structures.
A Wiki system is available to insert data into the database, providing a sharing and collaboration
environment. We generated and analyzed 3,621 amino acid sequence patterns, reporting highly
specific patterns for each amyloid family, along with patterns likely to be involved in protein
misfolding and aggregation.
Conclusion: AMYPdb is a comprehensive online database aiming at the centralization of
bioinformatic data regarding all amyloid proteins and their precursors. Our sequence pattern
discovery and analysis approach unveiled protein regions of significant interest. AMYPdb is freely
accessible [1].

Background
Amyloid deposits are abnormal in vivo extracellular aggregates of insoluble proteinaceous fibers exhibiting a crossbeta structure. The proteins or fragments found in these
aggregates derive from diverse full-length precursors
belonging to families without any obvious functional or
structural resemblance. In addition to these quite typical
extracellular deposits, other proteins can also form intracellular inclusions. Under the effect of diverse modifica-

tions, including interaction with chaperones, mutations,
supraphysiological concentrations, post-translational
modifications, and so on, amyloid proteins fail to fold
properly, thus accumulating irreversibly over long periods, with toxic effect [2-4].
Protein misfolding is associated with a wide range of
human diseases called amyloidoses. These may affect
multiple tissues, in the case of systemic amyloidoses, or

can be limited to a particular organ. Those pathologies
may have major health and social impacts, as in the case
of Alzheimer's disease [5], or might be somewhat benign,
such as the amyloidosis that can occur among diabetics at
the site of their insulin injections [6].
Prions are a special case among amyloid proteins because
of their unusual properties. They originate from the conversion of a normal host protein into a fibrillar structure
that then acts as an infectious particle [7]. To date only
one prion, PrP, has been discovered in vertebrates. It is
involved in major neurodegenerative diseases including
Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease,
Gerstmann-StraüsslerScheinker syndrome, and Kuru in humans, scrapie in
sheep, and spongiform encephalopathy in cattle. Prion
proteins are also described in eukaryotic microorganisms
(yeasts and fungi). However, in these latter organisms, the
prion isoform is not always toxic and can control normal
cellular processes [8,9]. The prion concept has been
recently extended to include mammalian prion-like proteins, such as Tia-1. This is an RNA-binding protein implicated in the assembly of the cytoplasmic aggregates
known as stress granules [10].
Schematically, the conversion of a normal soluble protein
into insoluble amyloid fibers begins with a conformational change, resulting in an intermediate form, an amyloidogenic isoform. This new conformation favors selfassociation in small oligomers that act as nucleation
units. The growth of the nucleation units leads to the formation of long protofilaments, which are wrapped to
form mature fibers [11]. Biophysical techniques have
shown that protofilaments may have various morphologies, but that they share common properties at the molecular level. The amyloid proteins/peptides form either
parallel or anti-parallel arrangements of beta-strands.
Since these beta-strands are perpendicular to the fiber
axis, this has been described as a cross-beta structure [12].
Despite the difficulties of using experimental approaches
to determine the precise 3D-structure of amyloid proteins
in their fibrillar state, several models have recently been
proposed [13]. These discoveries profit from computer
simulations being used more and more often in biology.
Some authors have demonstrated that amyloid-like structures can be obtained in vitro with almost any protein, suggesting that the ability to form fibers is a common
property of polypeptide chains [14]. However, the
number of proteins aggregating in vivo is low compared to
the over 3 million sequences stored in the Universal Protein Ressource (UniProtKB), and only include a few specific members of 31 families. The propensity of a protein
to aggregate into amyloid fibrils varies greatly with the
amino-acid sequence and with cellular environment. To
take just two examples: the globular protein lysozyme is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/273

only associated with amyloid deposition in the kidney
when it presents site-specific mutations (I56T, F57I,
W64R, D67H) [15], while phosphorylation of Huntingtin
may modulate its cleavage and toxicity [16].
During the past few years, bioinformatic approaches have
been dedicated to the discovery of sequence segments that
are sensitive to self-aggregation or that promote protein
destabilization [14,17-27]. All methods presented in
these papers are based on similar ideas. Each one tries to
calculate various aggregation indexes and profiles by
exploiting the information found in kinetic data, peptide/
protein sequences, conformation space, and/or 3D-structures. However, a common problem encountered in these
in silico experiments is the difficulty of finding and extracting accurate data from the existing literature and various
molecular databases.
For studies focusing on sequence features, three databases
are usually particularly useful: the UniProtKB, which provides sequences with functional annotations, comments,
and cross-references [28]; the PROSITE database, which
consists of a large collection of sequence signatures [29];
and the bibliographical database MEDLINE [30]. However, extraction of information from such general databases can be complex and time-consuming due to the
large amount of data available and because of the diversity of the gene or protein families. To compensate for
this, Siepen [31] developed a specialized database,
fibril_one, dedicated to the analysis of mutations associated with fibrillogenesis. Unfortunately, the usefulness of
this resource is limited, as fibril_one contains few data
and has never been updated.
To facilitate in silico comparison of proteins involved in
the formation of beta-sheet-rich fibrils in vivo, we have created a new multi-user database, the AMYloid Protein database (AMYPdb). The main goal in developing this
relational database was to provide a regularly updated
access to protein sequences and patterns describing each
family. The 3,621 amino acid sequence patterns stored in
the database can be screened to facilitate the assigning of
new sequences to a particular family and the formulation
of hypotheses about their function(s). Patterns conserved
in several families may also help in extracting rules about
the mechanisms of fibril formation.

Results and Discussion
Working with AMYPdb
AMYPdb is freely accessible [1]. Users can browse web
pages to obtain descriptions of each family, visualize protein sequences enriched with links to both UniProtKB and
the Protein DataBank (PDB), study multiple sequence
alignments using the Jalview editor [32], or access bibliographic references. An identity card for each protein is

BMC Bioinformatics 2008, 9:273

available from the "protein menu". Links to Wikipedia
provide further information on some families. Sequences
can be selected and exported in FASTA format for further
analysis.
The amino acid sequence patterns are accessible by browsing the pages from the "pattern" menu, or by using the
search interface. The search page contains several menus,
allowing the user to focus on particular data. For instance,
they can interrogate AMYPdb with UniProtKB or PROSITE
identifiers or patterns to determine whether a particular
protein or pattern is stored in AMYPdb. They can also submit a personal signature to find any matching amyloid
proteins, or inversely, they can submit a sequence to find
matching AMYPdb patterns. It is also possible to select
patterns using thresholds on quality scores. This method
is useful for discovering patterns shared between families.
Beyond functioning as a pure repository of knowledge,
AMYPdb also provides private workspaces to anyone
interested in further analysis. This allows users to manage
their own working sets of proteins and patterns, which
can be easily manipulated and organized accordingly to
their research interests.
Below, we have illustrated several ways that AMYPdb can
be useful in pattern research on amyloid proteins.
Protein family signatures
AMYPdb patterns can be used to highlight residues
though to be important to the structure, function and evolution of protein families. One of the objectives of our
project was to propose a list of specific amino acid
sequence patterns for each family stored in the database.
On the web interface of AMYPdb, the 3,621 amino acid
sequence patterns are classified by their CF value. About
27% of the patterns have a CF ≥ 0.9 (956 of 3,621) and
can be considered as very good descriptors for the corresponding amyloid families (Table 1, column n°5). The
best results are shown in Table 2. It is interesting to note
that all of the AMYPdb patterns noted in that table are of
better quality than those in the PROSITE database.

There are many advantages in describing a protein family
using several patterns rather than only one or two, as is
done in PROSITE. First, the occurrence of more than one
pattern increases confidence that a protein belongs to a
specific family. Pattern distribution along sequences can
also be used to assess conserved and variable regions in
proteins. Indeed, highly specific patterns only describe
conserved regions in proteins. Examples of this are the
Tau and prolactin protein families. Human Tau protein is
characterized by 13 patterns with CF ≥ 0.9, all found in the
C-terminal region of the protein and covering barely 14%
of the sequence. This suggests that the C-terminal part of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/273

Tau is the protein's main domain (indeed it is the microtubule-interacting region). On the other hand, 54 patterns
with CF ≥ 0.9 are characteristic of human prolactin, and
they are distributed all along the sequence, covering 32%
of it. This suggests the presence of numerous important
regions, which are likely correlated to the many known
biological effects of prolactin.
Amino acid sequence pattern exploration
Signatures of biological interest
Although patterns in AMYPdb were created from precursor proteins, users can easily access signatures matching
aggregation features and other biological annotations.
Indeed, for each pattern, the AMYPdb interface displays its
position in sequences, along with the corresponding UniProtKB features. There are 836 highly specific patterns (CF
≥ 0.9) covering annotated regions in proteins. Among
these, 251 patterns match variants associated with keywords such as aggregation, amyloidosis, Alzheimer, Parkinson, and so on (FT variant lines in UniProtKB). We
have successfully used AMYPdb for knowledge-rich data
mining concerning three amyloid families: transthyretin;
tau; and prion.

• In AMYPdb, 97 patterns (CF ≥ 0.9), distributed over the
entire sequence of human transthyretin (hTTR), map 31
of the 37 single-site amyloidogenic variants described in
UniProtKB. In pattern G-E-[ILV]-H-[EGN]-L-x(0,1)-Tx(3,4)-F-x(2)-G-[ILV]-[IY]-[KR]-[ILV]-E, the 9 underlined
amino acids correspond to pathogenic missense mutations in human TTR (positions 73–92). In particular, the
variant I88L is associated with an amyloid cardiomyopathy. Interestingly, the multiple sequence alignment available in AMYPdb reveals that leucine exists in the wild-type
sequence of seven organisms, including bovine and
sheep. Comparative study of these proteins with hTTR
could help to understand the effect of the mutation isoleucine/leucine in human disease.
• The human Tau protein sequence deduced from the
gene is composed of 757 amino acids. It exists however in
the human brain as 6 alternatively-spliced isoforms of
352 to 441 amino acids (Tau-A to F), with each isoform
containing 3 or 4 repeat domains (R repeats). Using the
AMYPdb search interface, we researched each isoform,
and found 8 patterns (CF ≥ 0.9) matching 1 to 6 isoforms.
One of the patterns, P-G-G-G-[KNS]-V-Q-I-[FIV]-[DHNY]
is observed in all of the isoforms, and matches "hot spot"
regions for nucleation, β-sheet aggregation and fibril formation both in vitro and in silico [19,33,34]. The pattern is
located at the junction between R repeats. It matches 3
regions in human tau (PGGGKVQIVY, PGGGKVQIIN and
PGGGSVQIVY), that correspond to 2 kinds of junctions:
R1–R3 in Tau-A, Tau-B and Tau-C (3 R repeats); and R1–
R2 and R2–R3 in Tau-D, Tau-E and Tau-F (4 R repeats).

Moreover, the pattern includes variants described as being
involved in tau pathogenicity: N596K, delV597, P618L,
P618S and S622N (numbering according to UniProtKB
P10306).
• In a recent study, Hamodrakas et al. [21] predicted amyloidogenic determinants in several proteins by combining
three methods. In the case of human prion (P04156), the
authors pointed out the segments 175–183 (FVHDCVNIT), 209–215 (VVEQMCI) and 242–251 (LLISFLIFLI). Using AMYPdb we searched for amino acid
sequence patterns and UniProtKB features matching these
segments. Some results are summarized in Table 3. The
high density of mutation/modification sites overlapping
the first two amyloidogenic segments is intriguing.
Indeed, these segments contain both the cysteines

involved in the unique disulfide bond between helix 2
and 3, and a glycozylation site involved in prion strain
propagation [35]. Although other regions have been
shown to be important for prion propagation, susceptibility, and other activities, our observations reinforce the
idea that in silico investigations are more efficient when
they combine several methods, such as sequence pattern
discovery, aggregation prediction, bibliographical knowledge, and so on.
Sequence patterns conserved in several families
By using fitness scores values in the search interface of
AMYPdb, it is possible to discover unexpected relations
between families of interest. An intriguing observation of
cross-conserved patterns between the huntingtin and prolactin families illustrates this. Although these families do

human huntingtin (3,144 residues) the patterns N°1 to
N°4 match respectively at position 212, 1501, 2092,
2789. Positions in human prolactin (227 residues) are 91,
108, 200, and 214 for patterns N° 3, 2, 1 and 4 respectively. Two of those patterns match known structural/
functional features in human huntingtin and human prolactin. Pattern N°1 is located in the first "HEAT repeat" of
huntingtin, belonging to the N-terminal part of the fragment found in amyloid aggregates [36]. The patterns N°1
and N°4 contain cysteines known to be involved in
disulfide bridges in prolactin. They are located in the 4th
α-helix of prolactin, already established to be part of the
site of interaction with one of the prolactin receptors [37].
The segment of human huntingtin and prolactin corresponding to pattern N°2 is located in the middle of each
protein and is predicted by the TANGO algorithm to be a
β-aggregating segment [19]. To our knowledge, this is the
first time that patterns have been described as shared
between huntingtin and prolactin.
Although it seems unlikely that these results were due to
chance, we searched for another pattern to confirm our
observations. We used PRATT with a new set of 99
sequences, corresponding to all full-length huntingtin
and prolactin proteins. We discovered a new highly specific pattern (N°5), R-[DV]-S-x-K-x(2)-[ANSTV]-x(3)[FILV]-[AGL]-x-[ACS], conserved in 100% of the data set
(Sen = 1). In a recent version of UniProtKB (release 10.5,
containing more than 4.7 million sequences), this pattern
retrieves new prolactin and huntingtin sequences, and
only about 50 false positive sequences ones. Pattern N°5
is located at position 710 and 205 in human huntingtin
and prolactin respectively, and includes a potential serine
phosphorylation site.

This process can be applied to other families. However, it
is clear that the quality of a prediction depends on the
quality and number of patterns found in common. Experimental work should be undertaken to confirm our observations and to further understand the functional/
structural significance of the conserved motifs shared
between the huntingtin and prolactin families. These
could reveal interaction sites with common cofactors such
as chaperones, or common motifs involved in aggregation
processes.
Pattern repeats
Amino acid repeats play an important structural role in
proteins and are often associated with diseases. This is the
case with huntingtin, which shows a polyglutamine tract
in its N-terminal part. However, repeats are not limited to
single amino acids, but can include domains repetitions
[38]. For example, repeats are thought to be involved in
PrP prionization in mammals, since birds, reptiles, fish
and amphibians do not show the same domain architecture [39,40]. In AMYPdb, 41 distinct patterns cover the Nterminal domain of PrPs. We observed that the amino
acid sequences of various patterns and their number of
occurrences is closely linked to the phylogenetic differences described above, such as for the pattern: G[GHKQRY]-[GNPSTY]-x-G-[GHQY]-G-x(0,3)-G-[QSWY][GHNPQ]-[GHPQRS]-[GNPQSTY]-x-[AGHNST]. In species from fishes to birds (which PrP is not demonstrated
to be pathogenic), only 1 occurrence of this pattern was
found in the N-terminal region while it is repeated 2 to 5
times in mammalian PrPs. The repetition might therefore
act to facilitate the structural conversion of PrPc into
PrPsc.

Conclusion
In this paper, we present a knowledge database dedicated
to amyloid precursor proteins and their amino acid
sequence signatures [1]. Our work sheds light on the signatures that best describe each amyloid family. Moreover,
we have extracted several patterns of interest to demonstrate how users can easily take advantage of the database
for their own research. Note that because there are only
sparse data on sequences which can form fibrils in vivo,
especially non-human organisms, we cannot yet automatically predict aggregation regions. In the future we will
continue to enrich the database with new families and
new functionalities, ensuring that AMYPdb will remain a
reference tool for researchers interested in bioinformatic
approaches to protein misfolding and aggregation. A wiki
system available in the "identity card" of the proteins
allows experts to add high quality data.

Methods
Implementation and structure of the database
AMYPdb is a MySQL relational database. The web-based
interface was created using PHP and JavaScript, and relies
on a modified version of the e107 content management
system. The data are stored in 23 tables and occupies
nearly 4 GB of disk space (Figure 1). The central table contains general information relevant to protein sequences.
This is linked to additional tables containing two kinds of
data: information collected from public libraries; and the
results of protein sequence analysis. This data organization is suitable for complex queries, such as the extraction
of amino-acid signatures matching the regions involved in
aggregation.
Raw data
The data flow is described in Figure 2. Raw data were
extracted from three main public databases: protein files
from UniProtKB (release 3.2); references from MEDLINE;
and known patterns from PROSITE. We used the
Sequence Retrieval System (SRS) program implemented
at the European Bioinformatics Institute [41]. SRS has the
advantage of possessing a unique interface for interrogating multiple databases. In addition, results can be saved in
eXtended Markup Language (XML) format, thus facilitating the exchange and manipulation of large amounts of
data between different programs. UniProtKB and
MEDLINE were searched using keywords describing the
amyloid protein families. The keywords used were mainly
protein and gene names commonly used in the amyloid
research field. Several phylogenetically distant sequences
of each family were then submitted to ScanProsite [42].
This program scans protein sequences for the occurrence
of signatures stored in the PROSITE database. The accession numbers of PROSITE patterns were then queried in
SRS. All retrieved XML files were imported into AMYPdb.
After this first selection step, we obtained a catalog of 31
amyloid families (Table 1), containing 1,284 amyloid
proteins, 1,692 references and 38 PROSITE patterns. Data
stored in AMYPdb are those of precursor proteins, amyloidogenic peptides and partial sequences. In this first version of AMYPdb, no immunoglobulin light/heavy chains
have been stored, due to the high sequence diversity of
those proteins.
Amino acid sequence pattern discovery
Pattern discovery
We employed the commonly-used software PRATT, developed to extract conserved patterns in a set of unaligned
protein sequences [43]. The "advanced PRATT" version,
accessible at OUEST-Genopole® [44], allows users to specify amino acids clusters, thus orienting the discovery of
interesting patterns. We selected most of the default
parameters of the program, and limited the maximum
pattern length to 20 amino acids. This choice is in agree-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/273

ment with data from the recent literature, which show that
short protein stretches may be involved in the self-assembly process of amyloid proteins [45].
Various analyses were carried out with "advanced PRATT"
using the default clusters, based on the physico-chemical
properties of amino acids. Moreover, we defined two
other sets of clusters, corresponding to criteria related to
amyloid aggregation. The first set was designed based on
the ability of amino acids to either form beta sheets (CIFTWYV), alpha helices (AREQLK) or other secondary structures (NDGHMPS) [46]. The second set was based on
whether amino acids are found at protein-protein interfaces (CHILMFWYV) or not (ARNDEQGKPST) [47,48]. A
refinement parameter was systematically tested (on and
off). When the parameter was switched on, ambiguous
pattern positions were generalized using the groups of
similar amino acids. Among the 31 known amyloid families, 9 could not be submitted to pattern matching
because of their small number of known sequences. On
the other hand, a few families had enough known
sequences to design several data sets. Finally, we applied
the pattern discovery method to 42 sets of sequences
using 6 parameters, and selected patterns matching 100%
of the sequences of each set. Thus, as described in Figure
2, and including the 38 PROSITE patterns, AMYPdb contains 3,621 patterns related to amyloid protein families.
Pattern matching
In addition to pattern comparison, we also scanned the
UniProtKB database (release 6.1) for sequences matching
any of the 3,621 patterns. To do this, we used WAPAM
[44], specifically developed to parse a list of amino acid
patterns and to search for those patterns in sequence databases. Compared to other pattern-matching tools,
WAPAM has several advantages. It has no limit in the pattern's length, flexibility, or indetermination. It also uses
Rdisk technology, a specialized architecture that can
highly accelerate a search. Using WAPAM with Rdisk, the
scan of UniProtKB for the 3,621 patterns took less than 15
hours, instead of the estimated 2,000 hours it would have
taken without it. UniProtKB returned 267,490 sequences
matching AMYPdb patterns, although the number here is
underestimated due to WAPAM's retrieval limitation. The
UniProtKB files of these sequences were stored as a nonamyloid group in AMYPdb and were used for the classification procedure described below.
Database updating procedure
Since the content of UniProtKB was evolving during the
various development phases of our project (631,592
entries added from release 3.2 to 6.1), we updated
AMYPdb by semi-automatically sorting the 267,490
sequences extracted with WAPAM. From this group, we
picked out 421 protein sequences matching highly spe-

Pattern quality
To measure pattern performance, we used three fitness
scores commonly used in classification problems: sensitivity (Sen); specificity (Spe); and correlation (CF)
[49,50]. The scores of the 3,621 patterns were calculated
for each family, using only full-length sequences. For each
pattern, true positives (TP) and false negatives (FN) are
sequences of a family respectively either matching or not
matching the pattern. False positives (FP) are either amyloid sequences not belonging to the considered family but
which match the pattern, or non-amyloid sequences
matching the pattern. True negatives (TN) are non-amyloid sequences not matching the pattern. Therefore, when
a pattern is specific for one amyloid family, it has high
Sen, Spe and CF scores for that family and low scores for
other amyloid families. When a pattern is conserved in
several amyloid families, the Spe of the pattern remains
high for each family, but Sen and CF scores can decrease
dramatically. Due to calculation limitations, non-amyloid
sequences were obtained from 1 of 3 data sets: the
2,032,835 proteins of UniProtKB was used for patterns
matching less than 5000 non-amyloid proteins; the
267,069 non-amyloid sequences resulting from the
WAPAM search was used for patterns for matching
between 5,000 and 10,000 non-amyloid proteins; and a
random pool of 50,000 proteins was used for patterns
matching more than 10,000 non-amyloid proteins.

For each pattern, sensitivity corresponds to its ability to
describe an amyloid family, while specificity corresponds
to its ability to discard proteins not belonging to the amyloid family. The Pearson-Mathews correlation coefficient
measures the global prediction accuracy by which a pattern describes a protein family. A CF of +1 indicates that
the pattern perfectly differentiate the amyloid family from
other amyloid families and non-amyloid proteins.

Sen = TP /(TP + FN )
Spe = TN /(FP + TN )

cific AMYPdb patterns, and we assigned these sequences
to the corresponding amyloid families. This updating procedure increased the AMYPdb sequence group to 1,705
members (1,063 full-length sequences and 642 fragments, Figure 2), and leaving 267,069 sequences in the
non-amyloid protein group.

Amyloid classification
The accuracy of hypotheses deduced from bioinformatic
methods strongly depends on data sets quality. In the
present study, the sequence sets used in the pattern discovery method were those of protein families. In order to
facilitate sequence extraction, especially for the discovery
of patterns link to misfolding and aggregation, all the proteins were sorted into one of the five following quality categories:

• Amyloid in vivo: the precursor protein, or a specific subsegment, forms fibrils in human, or animals, or is a yeast
prion. Proteins of this class are unambiguously described
