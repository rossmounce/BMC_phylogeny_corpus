Abstract
Background: Tea is one of the most popular non-alcoholic beverages worldwide. However, the tea plant, Camellia
sinensis, is difficult to culture in vitro, to transform, and has a large genome, rendering little genomic information
available. Recent advances in large-scale RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) provide a fast, cost-effective, and reliable
approach to generate large expression datasets for functional genomic analysis, which is especially suitable for
non-model species with un-sequenced genomes.
Results: Using high-throughput Illumina RNA-seq, the transcriptome from poly (A)+ RNA of C. sinensis was analyzed
at an unprecedented depth (2.59 gigabase pairs). Approximate 34.5 million reads were obtained, trimmed, and
assembled into 127,094 unigenes, with an average length of 355 bp and an N50 of 506 bp, which consisted of 788
contig clusters and 126,306 singletons. This number of unigenes was 10-fold higher than existing C. sinensis
sequences deposited in GenBank (as of August 2010). Sequence similarity analyses against six public databases
(Uniprot, NR and COGs at NCBI, Pfam, InterPro and KEGG) found 55,088 unigenes that could be annotated with
gene descriptions, conserved protein domains, or gene ontology terms. Some of the unigenes were assigned to
putative metabolic pathways. Targeted searches using these annotations identified the majority of genes
associated with several primary metabolic pathways and natural product pathways that are important to tea
quality, such as flavonoid, theanine and caffeine biosynthesis pathways. Novel candidate genes of these secondary
pathways were discovered. Comparisons with four previously prepared cDNA libraries revealed that this
transcriptome dataset has both a high degree of consistency with previous EST data and an approximate 20 times
increase in coverage. Thirteen unigenes related to theanine and flavonoid synthesis were validated. Their
expression patterns in different organs of the tea plant were analyzed by RT-PCR and quantitative real time PCR
(qRT-PCR).
Conclusions: An extensive transcriptome dataset has been obtained from the deep sequencing of tea plant. The
coverage of the transcriptome is comprehensive enough to discover all known genes of several major metabolic
pathways. This transcriptome dataset can serve as an important public information platform for gene expression,
genomics, and functional genomic studies in C. sinensis.

Background
The tea beverage yields many health benefits to humans
due to the extensive secondary metabolites in tea leaves,
including polyphenols, theanine, and volatile oils [1,2].
The tea plant, Camellia sinensis, is both an economically
important horticultural crop and a model system for
studying self-incompatibility and Theaceae plants [3].
Due to its large genome (4.0 Gigabases) [4] and lacks of
developed genetic tools such as tissue culture and transformation, little genomic information is available. As of
August 2010, only 810 nucleotide sequences, 12,664
expressed sequence tags (ESTs), 1 genome survey
sequence (GSS), and 478 proteins from C. sinensis have
been deposited in GenBank. The bulk of tea research
has focused on analysis of secondary metabolism genes,
which were mostly discovered through EST sequencing.
In one study, 588 ESTs derived from a subtractive
cDNA library were sequenced. Approximately 8.7% of
these ESTs were related to secondary metabolism,
including leucoanthocyanidin reductase (LCR) involved
in catechin synthesis [5]. In another study, 4.8% of the
1,684 ESTs in a tender shoot cDNA library were related
to secondary metabolism, including chalcone isomerase
(CHI) [6]. Moreover, in a young tea root cDNA library
constructed in our laboratory, 4.5% of the 4,860 valid
ESTs were secondary metabolic genes [7].
EST sequencing has long been the core technology for
reference transcript discovery [8-10]. However, EST
sequencing has some inherent limitations, such as low
throughput, high cost, and lack of quantitation of the
expressed genes. In addition, there is some bias in the
composition of cDNA libraries caused by bacterial cloning, such as vector contamination, overrepresentation of
preferentially cloned sequences, and inadequate representation of rare or inherently unclonable transcripts
[11-13]. These inherent limitations of EST sequencing
and the small number of available ESTs suggested that
our understanding of the tea transcriptome is far from
complete.
The cost-effective and ultra-high-throughput DNA
sequencing technology, RNA-seq, is a revolutionary
advance in genome-scale sequencing. This transcriptome
analysis method is fast and simple because it does not
require bacterial cloning of the cDNAs. Direct sequencing of these cDNAs can generate short reads at an
extraordinary depth. Following sequencing, the resulting
reads can be assembled into a genome-scale transcription profile. It is a more comprehensive and efficient
way to measure transcriptome composition, obtain RNA
expression patterns, and discover new exons and genes
[11-16]. Recent transcriptomic studies on yeast, Arabidopsis thaliana, mouse, and human cells have demonstrated that this approach is well-suited for surveying

the complexity of transcription in eukaryotes [11,17-23].
Since RNA-seq is not limited to detecting transcripts
that correspond to existing genomic sequences, it is particularly attractive for non-model organisms with genomic sequences that are yet to be determined [24-27]. In
addition, this new approach is very sensitive, allowing
detections of low abundant transcripts.
In this report, we took advantage of RNA-seq to survey the poly (A)+ transcriptome of C. sinensis. The coverage of the transcriptome, at 2.59 gigabase pairs, was
comprehensive enough to discover all known genes of
several major metabolic pathways. This transcriptome
dataset will serve as a public information platform for
gene expression, genomics, and functional genomics in
C. sinensis.

Results
Sequencing, de novo assembly, and sequence analysis

To comprehensively cover the tea transcriptome, total
RNA was extracted from seven different tissues: tender
shoots, young leaves, mature leaves, stems, young roots,
flower buds and immature seeds. Equal amounts of total
RNA from each tissue were pooled together. The poly
(A)+ RNA was isolated, sheered into smaller fragments,
and reverse-transcribed to synthesize cDNA for Illumina
GA IIx sequencing. A total of 34.5 million reads 75 bp
long (including single-end reads and paired-end reads)
were obtained from one plate (8 lanes) in a single
sequencing run, generating approximate 2.59 gigabase
pairs (Gbp) of raw data. An overview of the sequencing
and assembly is outlined in Table 1. After removal of
adaptor sequences, duplication sequences, ambiguous
reads and low-quality reads, 30.9 million high-quality
clean reads (2.32 Gbp, 89.6% of the raw data) remained.
The quality of the clean reads data was assessed based
on the base-calling quality scores from the Illumina’s
base-caller Bustard. Eighty-one percent of the clean
reads data (1.88 Gbp, data not shown) has Phred-like
quality scores at the Q20 level (an error probability of
0.01). All high-quality reads were assembled de novo by
SOAPdenovo program [28], producing 191,376 contigs
longer than 100 bp (amounting to 39.72 Mbp), with an
average contig length of 208 bp and an N50 of 225 bp
(i.e. 50% of the assembled bases were incorporated into
contigs 225 bp or longer). The size distribution of these
contigs is shown in Figure 1a. Although the majority of
the contigs are between 100 to 300 bp, we obtained
9,209 contigs which were greater than 500 bp in length.
The data from the paired-end sequencing was used to
join the contigs into scaffolds, which represent the collections of fragments originating from a single transcript. Overall, the contig-joining procedure based on
paired-end reads condensed the number of contigs from

191,376 to 127,901. Among them, 119,105 contigs
(62.2% of total) merged into 55,630 unique scaffolds.
Subsequently, gap filling and contig joining were carried out to complete as many scaffolds as possible.
Through scaffold assembly, an additional 5.35 Mbp were
incorporated into existing scaffolds. The amount of all
processed data totalled 45.07 Mbp, which further
improved the quality of de novo assembly of these short
reads.
Assembly of transcriptome sequencing reads can produce more scaffolds than expressed genes, reflecting
redundancy among the assembled sequences (i.e., more
than one sequence per gene). To reduce any redundancy, assembled sequences from the above analysis
were clustered using the Gene Indices Clustering Tools
[29]. Sequence clustering merged 1,596 scaffolds into
788 sequence clusters (also known as “consensuses”).
These sequence clusters had 2-4 scaffolds per cluster,
and 99% of the clusters contained two scaffolds. The
remaining 126,306 scaffolds were retained as singletons,
for a total of 127,094 “unigenes”. This result demonstrated that the assembly and contig joining succeeded
in processing a large amount of short reads from the tea
plant samples with relatively little redundancy.
Out of the 127,094 unigenes, 22,757 unigenes were
≥500 bp and 7,820 were ≥1,000 bp, with an average unigenes length of 355 bp and an N50 of 506 bp. The size
distribution for these unigenes is shown in Figure 1b.
The unigene distribution followed the contig distribution closely, with the majority being shorter sequences.
To evaluate the quality of the dataset, we analyzed the
ratio of the gap’s length to the length of assembled unigenes (Figure 1c). The majority of the unigenes showed
gap lengths that were less than 5% of the total length,
which accounted for 90.0% of total unigenes numbers
(114,346 unigenes). In addition, sequencing bias was
analyzed by detecting random distribution of reads in
assembled unigenes (Figure 1d). Although the 3’ ends of
all assembled unigenes contained relatively fewer numbers of reads, other positions of all assembled unigenes
showed greater and more even distribution. This observation is consistent with previous publications [27], suggesting that the quality of our dataset was comparable
to similar reports in other non-model species.
Functional annotation and classification of the C. sinensis
transcriptome

Annotation of the C. sinensis transcriptome sequences was based on two levels of sequence similarity,
namely sequence-based and domain-based alignments.
Sequence-based alignments were performed against three
public databases, including the non-redundant protein
database (NR) at NCBI, Swiss-Prot/Uniprot, and the
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database

Page 4 of 19

(KEGG) using BLASTX algorithm with a significant
E-value threshold of 1e -5 . Domain/family searches
contained Hidden Markov Model (HMM) domain/family
searches in both the InterPro and Pfam databases and
BLASTX alignments against the Clusters of Orthologous
Groups (COGs) database at NCBI. The E-value thresholds were also set at ≤1e -5 . Annotations of the best
BLASTX hits and domain hits are summarized in
Table 2.
Annotation of predicted proteins

For annotations of gene names, coding sequences (CDS),
and predicted proteins, all assembled sequences were
first searched against plant proteins of the NR database,
which returned 41,483 significant BLAST hits (32.6% of
all unigenes; see Table 2 and Additional File 1). The
length of query sequences was crucial in determining
the level of significance of the BLAST match. As shown
in Figure 2a, only 20.5% of the unigenes shorter than
500 bp could achieve significant BLAST scores in the
NR database. In contrast, the proportion of unigenes
with significant BLAST scores increased sharply
to: 83.3% for query sequences between 500 and
1,000 bp; 96.5% for query sequences between 1,000 and
1,500 bp; 98.6% for query sequences between 1,500
and 2,000 bp; and 99.9% for query sequences ≥2,000 bp.
The result indicates that the proportion of sequences
with matches in the NR database is greater among the
longer assembled sequences. Similar analytical results
were obtained using the other five databases (data not
shown). The E-value distribution of the top hits in
the NR database showed that 40.9% of the mapped
sequences have strong homology (smaller than 1.0e-50),
while the other 59.1% of the homologous sequences ranged between 1.0e-5 to 1.0e-50 (Figure 2b). The similarity
distribution showed 34.2% of the query sequences have
a similarity higher than 80%, while 65.8% of the hits
have a similarity ranging from 20% to 80% (Figure 2c).
Homologous genes come from several species, with
57.4% of the unigenes have the highest homology to
genes from Vitis vinifera, followed by Ricinus communis
(15.4%), Populus trichocarpa (14.5%), Arabidopsis thaliana (1.6%) and Glycine max (1.6%) (Figure 2d).
Because of the relatively short length of the unigenes
(mean size of 355 bp) and the lack of C. sinensis genome information, two-thirds of the unigenes did not
have a match in the plant protein dataset of NR database. Furthermore, 77 percent of the above mentioned
41,483 annotation descriptions were uninformative (e.
g., ‘unknown’, ‘unnamed’, ‘putative’, or ‘hypothetical’
protein). The protein dataset of the model dicot plant
Arabidopsis (from NR) and Swiss-Prot/Uniprot database,
both of which contain highly annotated protein
sequences, were used for additional BLAST alignments
to produce more definitive annotations. As a result,

there were 50,214 and 25,462 high-score BLAST
matches from the comparisons with Arabidopsis and

functions (data not shown). By integration of similarity
search results from plant proteins and Arabidopsis proteins, a total of 53,937 unique best BLASTX matches

putative functions (gene names and ‘CDS’ or protein
sequences) to the unigenes.
Conserved domain annotation and COG classification

Considering that different genes can share certain protein domains, reflecting a level of sequence similarity
not accounted for by simple sequence-based alignments,
conserved domains in C. sinensis unigenes were further
identified against the InterPro, Pfam and COGs databases. Searches against the InterPro database [30]
revealed 32,646 top hits categorized into 3,485 domains/
families (Table 2 and Figure 3b). Most domains were
found containing 1-3 sequences, with a small proportion
appearing more frequently. InterPro domains/families
were ranked according to the number of C. sinensis unigenes contained in each InterPro domain, and the 30
most abundant InterPro domains/families are represented in Table 3. Among these protein domains/
families, “Protein kinase” and its subcategories “Serine/
threonine-protein kinase” and “Tyrosine-protein kinase”,
known to regulate the majority of cellular pathways,
were ranked in the top. Moreover, highly represented
were “Cytochrome P450” and “UDP-glucosyltransferase”
families, which might contribute to extensive modifications of various secondary compounds, the “WD40repeat” domain, associated with regulation of signal
transduction, transcription and proliferation [31], and
the “Heat shock protein” family, related to defense
mechanisms of thermal stress. In addition, 40,638 of the
assembled unigenes matched entries in the Pfam database [32], corresponding to 6,673 different domains/
families (Table 2 and Figure 3b). The top 8 most frequently detected domains contained “Protein kinase,”
“Tyrosine-protein kinase,” “Pentatricopeptide repeat,”
“Cytochrome P450,” “UDP-glucosyltransferase,” “RNA
recognition motif,” “WD40-repeat,” and “Reverse transcriptase (RNA-dependent DNA polymerase) “ (see
Additional File 2). The top 8 Pfam results were all in

Figure 3 Venn diagram showing distribution of similarity search results. (a) The number of unique sequence-based annotations is the sum
of unique best BLASTX hits from the NR (NR counts including the unique BLASTX hits from the plant proteins and Arabidopsis proteins), Uniprot
and KEGG databases (E-value ≤ 1.0e-5), respectively. The overlap regions among the three circles contain the number of unigenes that share
BLASTX similarity with respective databases. (b) The number of unique domain-based annotations is the integration of unique similarity search
results against the InterPro, Pfam and COGs databases (E-value ≤ 1.0e-5), respectively. (c) Number of all annotated C. sinensis unigenes is figured

counts in Figure 3b), respectively.

the above mentioned 30-most-abundant InterPro
domain list.
More specifically, the assembled unigenes were compared against COGs [33] for in-depth analysis of phylogenetically widespread domain families. COGs consist of
protein sequences encoded in 21 complete genomes,
including bacteria, algae and eukaryotes, and were built
on classifications according to phylogenetic relationships. Each COG consists of individual proteins or
groups of paralogs from at least three lineages and thus
corresponds to an ancient conserved domain. From
C. sinensis unigenes set, 11,241 of the assembled
sequences showing significant homology were assigned
to the appropriate COG clusters (Table 2 and Figure
3b). Because some of these unigenes were annotated
with multiple COG functions, altogether 15,701 functional annotations were produced. These COG classifications were grouped into 24 function categories
(Figure 4). The five largest categories include 1) “general
functions” (17.1%) associated with basic physiological
and metabolic functions; 2) “replication, recombination
and repair” (9.7%); 3) “transcription” (9.7%); 4) “signal
transduction mechanisms” (7.7%); and 5) “posttranslational modification, protein turnover and chaperones”
(7.2%). The category of secondary metabolism was highlighted with 2.7% (427 of the functional genes), because
of the importance of secondary metabolites to the quality and taste of tea. The most abundant sequences in
this category are cytochrome P450 monooxygenases,
with a total of 147 unigenes involved in various metabolic pathways. In total, 44,705 unique domain-based

annotations from InterPro, Pfam and COGs were
assigned to C. sinensis unigenes (Figure 3b).
Gene Ontology (GO) Classification

To functionally categorize C. sinensis unigenes, Gene
Ontology (GO) terms were assigned to each assembled
unigene. GO terms are dynamically-structured control
vocabulary that can be applied to describe functions of
genes and by which genes can be classified into three
major categories, namely biological process, molecular
function, and cellular component, and their sub-categories [34]. Out of the 41,483 most significant BLASTX
hits against the NR plant species dataset, a total of 3,577
tea unigenes were assigned 14,283 GO term annotations
using BLAST2GO [35]. These 14,283 GO terms were
summarized into the three main GO categories and 43
sub-categories (Table 2 and Figure 5a). Cellular component made up the majority of the GO annotations
(5,529, 38.7% of the total), followed by biological process
(5,155, 36.1%) and molecular function (3,599, 25.2%).
The major sub-categories are shown in Figure 5a: three
sub-categories of “cell” (GO: 0005623), “cell part” (GO:
0044464) and “organelle” (GO: 0043226) were in the
cluster of cellular component; two sub-categories of
“binding functions” (GO: 0005488) and “catalytic functions” (GO: 0003824) were in the cluster of molecular
function; and six sub-categories of “metabolic process”
(GO: 0008152), “cellular process” (GO: 0009987), “biological regulation” (GO: 0065007), “establishment of localization” (GO: 0051234), “localization” (GO: 0051179),
and “pigmentation” (GO: 00437473) were in the cluster
of biological process. However, this result showed only a

small proportion of tea unigenes with GO distributions,
possibly due to large number of uninformative gene
descriptions of these plant protein hits.
The 50,214 of BLASTX matches to Arabidopsis proteins was used for further GO mappings to improve the
coverage and depth of GO annotation, because the Arabidopsis dataset has been extensively annotated with GO
terms and the most abundant annotation records for
C. sinensis unigenes were obtained from the comparisons with Arabidopsis proteins. As a result, the number
of C. sinensis unigenes assigned with GO terms greatly
increased to 32,107 (25% of the 127,094 unigenes).
A total of 157,650 GO terms were associated with these
32,107 unigenes and classified into 41 functional subcategories (Table 2 and Figure 5b). We discovered that
the cluster of biological process was dominant (96,296,

61% of the total GO terms), in which the three sub-categories “response to stimulus” (GO: 0050896), “developmental process” (GO: 0032502), and “multicellular
organismal process” (GO: 0032501) were included in the
top 6 abundant sub-groups (in addition to the other
three sub-categories of “cellular process,” “metabolic
process” and “biological regulation”). The major subcategories in the clusters of cell component and molecular function were identical to the above mentioned GO
classification. Moreover, only a few genes were assigned
with “biological adhesion” (GO: 0022610), “locomotion”
(GO: 0040011), “viral reproduction” (GO: 0016032) or
“electron carrier” (GO: 0009055) GO terms. Out of 41
functional sub-categories, unigenes were sorted into the
two previously unrepresented sub-categories of “rhythmic process” (GO: 0048511; 251 unigenes) and “viral

Arabidopsis GO terms. No unigenes were annotated
with “virion” (GO: 0019012), “virion part” (GO:
0044423), “chemoattractant” (GO: 0042056) or “chemorepellent” (GO: 0045499) GO terms. As a whole, 32,599
(26% of the 127,094 unigenes) of the unigenes were
associated with at least one GO terms between the two
kinds of GO annotations. These GO annotations
demonstrate that C. sinensis expressed genes encoding
diverse structural, regulatory and stress proteins.

1,122 unigenes were annotated by domain-based alignments. Overall, 55,088 unique sequence-based or
domain-based annotations using the six selected public
databases were assigned to C. sinensis unigenes (43.3%
of the assembled unigenes). Among them, 9,139 unigenes had hits in all six public databases with relatively
defined functional annotations (Table 2). These annotations provide a valuable resource for investigating specific processes, structures, functions, and pathways in tea
research.

KEGG Pathway mapping

In order to identify the biological pathways active in
C. sinensis, the assembled unigenes were annotated with
corresponding Enzyme commission (EC) numbers from
BLASTX alignments against the KEGG database [36].
By mapping EC numbers to the reference canonical
pathways, a total of 16,939 unigenes were assigned to
214 KEGG pathways (Table 2 and Figure 3a). The pathways most represented by unique sequences were inositol phosphate metabolism (1,348 members), benzoate
degradation via CoA ligation (1,262 members), starch
and sucrose metabolism (781 members) and purine
metabolism (371 members).
Taken together, 53,966 unique sequence-based annotations had BLAST scores exceeding our threshold
(≤1e-5) in NR, Uniprot and KEGG databases (Figure 3a).
The Venn diagram (Figure 3c) shows that an additional

Analysis of metabolic pathway genes using C. sinensis
unigenes

The 55,088 annotated unigenes represented a significant
expansion of the knowledge contained in existing
C. sinensis EST libraries. Analysis of metabolic pathway
genes using C. sinensis unigenes was accomplished as
illustrated in Figure 6. We selected several primary and
secondary metabolic pathways that are related to tea
quality for further analysis. For functional annotations,
we started with simple keyword searches and confirmed
each search result with BLAST searches. These new
genes and their annotations were compared with genes
listed in the existing tea uniEST database [5-7].
Primary metabolic pathways in C. sinensis

The primary metabolic pathways selected included glycolysis (10 genes), citrate cycle (10 genes), pentose

sequences for all genes in the selected four primary
metabolic pathways, except for the glucose-6-phosphatase gene in the Calvin cycle (Additional File 3).

high homology to Arabidopsis or other dicot genes, with
most of the genes having more than 80% similarity at
the protein levels (data not shown), suggesting that
these genes were highly conserved during the evolution.
Secondary metabolic pathways in C. sinensis

Flavonoid Biosynthesis Flavonoids are a class of important secondary metabolites including flavanones, flavones, dihydroflavonols, flavonols, and flavan 3-ols
(catechins). They are important for tea quality and
human health, especially catechins [37]. They also play a
crucial role in plant defense against pathogens. In tea,
flavonoids accumulate to higher levels in young leaves
than in mature leaves [5]. In our annotated C. sinensis
transcriptome dataset, multiple transcripts encoding
almost all known enzymes involved in the main flavonoid biosynthesis pathway were identified (Figure 7a).
Unigene IDs from the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway
are listed in Additional File 4. Flavonoids are derived
from phenylalanine and converted to chalcone via the
phenylpropanoid pathway by the enzymes phenylalanine
ammonia lyase (EC 4.3.1.24, 11 unigenes), cinnamate
4-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.13.11, no annotated unigenes

available), 4-coumarate CoA ligase (EC 6.2.1.12, 22 unigenes), and chalcone synthase (EC 2.3.1.74, 3 unigenes).
Subsequently, chalcone isomerase (EC 5.5.1.6, 1 unigene) catalyzes the stereo-specific cyclization of chalcones into naringenin (5, 7, 4’-trihydroxyflavanone).
Naringenin can be converted by flavonoid 3’-hydroxylase
(EC 1.14.13.21, 9 unigenes) and flavonoid 3’, 5’-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.13.88, 6 unigenes) to produce eriodictyol
(5,7,3’,4’-tetrahydroxyflavanone) and dihydrotricetin
(5,7,3’,4’,5’-pentahydroxyflavanone), respectively. Naringenin, eriodictyol and dihydrotricetin are the flavanones.
Almost all flavonoid compounds can be derived from
these flavanones. Flavone synthase (EC 1.14.11.2, 2 unigenes encoding FNSⅡ) catalyzes the conversion of flavanones to flavones, but flavanone 3-hydroxylase (EC
1.14.11.9, 10 unigenes) can convert these flavanones to
dihydroflavonols. Following this reaction, the divergent
conversions of dihydroflavonols include production of
flavonols [catalyzed by flavonol synthase (EC 1.14.11.23,
25 unigenes)] and flavan-3,4-diols (leucoanthocyanidin)
[catalyzed by dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (EC 1.1.1.219,
37 unigenes)]. Leucoanthocyanidins are the direct

precursors to (+)-flavan 3-ols (e.g. (+)-catechin, (+)-gallocatechin) produced by leucoanthocyanidin reductase (EC
1.17.1.3, 6 unigenes). Formation of (-)-epiflavan 3-ols
(e.g. (-)-epicatechin, (-)-epigallocatechin) can be achieved
by a two-step reaction on leucoanthocyanidin by anthocyanidin synthase (EC 1.14.11.19, 1 unigenes) and anthocyanidin reductase (EC 1.3.1.77, 1 unigene). The above
descriptions showed the vertical pathway responsible
for the formation and conversion of the sub-categories
of flavonoids. It is worth mentioning that flavonoid

biosynthesis also includes multiple, parallel sub-pathways,
which result from flavonoid 3’-hydroxylase and flavonoid
3’, 5’-hydroxylase also accepting the flavones, dihydroflavonols, and flavonols as substrates (data not shown in Figure
7a). Therefore, flavonoid biosynthesis looks more like a
complex metabolic grid [38] than a linear pathway. Since
almost all the genes from the flavonoid pathway appeared
to have more than one copy in the genome, we suspect
C. sinensis encountered genome duplication events during
the course of evolution.

Shi et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:131
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/131

Some genes of the phenylpropanoid pathway have
been reported previously in C. sinensis. Some members
have been expressed in Escherichia coli and were characterized [39-44] to be involved in catechin biosynthesis.
We were able to detect these reported genes in our
dataset (Additional File 4). Surprisingly, some genes
associated with isoflavonoid metabolism were also
discovered in our transcriptome, including isoflavone reductase (EC 1.3.1.-, 8 unigenes) and isoflavone
7-O-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.150, 1 unigene). The
tea plant is not known to produce isoflavones. Similar
discoveries have been reported in other non-isoflavone
accumulating plants [45], suggesting homologs of isoflavone reductase and isoflavone O-methyltransferase may
have general metabolic functions in many plant species.
In addition, new structural genes encoding flavonoidmodifying enzymes were discovered by a sequence or
domain search on our dataset against the existing
nucleotide and protein sequences of C. sinensis in NCBI
or Uniprot databases. Most of these new genes are
involved in glycosylation of flavonoids, catalyzing the
transfer of either glucose from UDP-glucose or rhamnose from UDP-L-rhamnose to the hydroxyl groups of
flavonoids (Additional File 4). For example, we found
unigene sequences encoding tetrahydroxychalcone
2’-glucosyltransferase (1 unigene), flavonol-3-O-glycoside-7-O-glucosyltransferase 1 (6 unigenes), flavonol 3O-glucosyltransferase/flavonoid-3-O-glucosyltransferase
(EC 2.4.1.91, 7 unigenes), anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.115, 33 unigenes), anthocyanidin
5,3-O-glucosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.-, 12 unigenes),
flavonol 3-O-glucoside L-rhamnosyltransferase (EC
2.4.1.159, 5 unigenes), and flavanone 7-O-glucoside
2’’-O-beta-L-rhamnosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.236, 10
unigenes). Moreover, unigenes encoding flavonol
3-O-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.76, associated with
methylation of flavonols, 9 unigenes) and flavonol 3-sulfotransferase (EC 2.8.2.25, 2 unigenes) were also found
in our annotated transcriptome. These genes represent
an extensive repertoire of flavonoid modification
enzymes that have not been reported before, although
some of the conjugated compounds themselves have
been identified.
Furthermore, a singleton for the flavonoid-related
R2R3 transcription factor, a MYB4a repressor, was
found. It is a member of the MYB transcription factor
family that has been shown to interact with promoters
of the phenylpropanoid pathway genes [46].
Theanine Biosynthesis Theanine is a unique amino acid
constituting 1-2% of the dry weight of tea leaf. It is
synthesized in roots from glutamic acid and ethylamine
by theanine synthetase (TS, EC 6.3.1.6; Figure 7b)
[47,48]. The substrate ethylamine is derived from decarboxylation of alanine [49]. Newly synthesized theanine is

Page 12 of 19

translocated into the tender shoots through the xylem,
where it either accumulates or is broken down into glutamic acid and ethylamine by theanine hydrolase (ThYD,
EC 3.5.1.65) [50]. The enzymes involved in theanine
synthesis also include glutamine synthetase (GS, EC
6.3.1.2), glutamate synthase (Fe-GOGAT, EC 1.4.7.1),
glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH, EC 1.4.1.3), alanine
transaminase (ALT, EC 2.6.1.2), and alanine decarboxylase (AIDA). Most of these theanine pathway genes were
found in our dataset, except for AIDA and ThYD, which
are specific to tea plants with no orthologs from other
species be found in the public databases (Figure 7b; unigene IDs in the theanine biosynthesis pathway are listed
in Additional File 4.). The AIDA sequences here were
selected from the homologues of arginine decaboxylase
(ADC) and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase
(SAMDC), which have similar domains to AIDA [51].
The published TS was highly homologous to GS, thus the
identified singletons needs to be confirmed enzymatically. Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT, EC 2.3.2.2),
used to synthesize theanine in bacteria [52-54], was chosen for a comparative study of the expression abundance
in three different organs (see below).
Caffeine Biosynthesis Caffeine (1, 3, 7-trimethylxanthine) is a purine alkaloid present in high concentrations in the tea plant. The caffeine biosynthesis pathway
(Figure 7c) is part of the purine metabolism and is catalyzed by three S-adenosyl-L-methionine- (SAM) dependent N-methylation steps, namely xanthosine ®
7-methylxanthosine ® 7-methylxanthine ® theobromine ® caffeine. Different N-methyltransferases play
important roles in the three N-methylation steps [55].
All related genes could be found in our transcriptome
except the two genes guanosine deaminase (EC 3.5.4.15)
and N-methylnucleosidase (EC 3.2.2.25) (Figure 7c; unigene IDs are listed in Additional File 4.). These two
genes have not been cloned previously and thus do not
exist in public databases.
ORF prediction of selected housekeeping gene

To further confirm our gene prediction and annotation
algorithms, six housekeeping gene families were selected
for open reading frame (ORF) analysis, namely actin,
tubulin, histone, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 28S ribosomal protein, phosphofructokinase (Additional File 5). Out of a total of 88 unigene sequences, 62
sequences were predicted to contain the complete ORF,
suggesting that among the house keeping genes, 70.5% of
the genes already have the completed ORF. The deduced
amino acid sequences have at least 68% homology to
Arabidopsis or other dicot genes (data not shown).
Comparison of C. sinensis transcriptome with four Camellia
cDNA libraries

Previously, we generated four cDNA libraries using different tissues of the C. sinensis plant. These tissues

Shi et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:131
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/131

included young root, young leaf, subtractive young leaf,
and drought-stressed root. The cDNAs were sequenced
using the conventional Sanger sequencing. We compared these four cDNA libraries with our Illumina
sequences using local BLASTN and TBLASTX.
First, all EST sequences from the four selected Camellia cDNA libraries were assembled by Cap3 procedure
[56] to obtain 1,809 uniESTs in the young root library,
921 uniESTs in the tender shoot library, 239 uniESTs in
the young leaves subtractive cDNA library, and 419 uniESTs in the drought-stressed root SSH (suppression
subtractive hybridization) library of C. sinensis var. assamica. We found that less than 5% of the unigenes from
the Illumina transcriptome dataset have significant
homology to the four uniEST databases at the nucleotide level, and less than 10% at the amino acid level.
The alignment of C. sinensis transcriptome against the
young root cDNA library produced the maximum number of best hits (Figure 8a, Figure 8b). These significant
hits covered 75~85% of uniESTs in the four cDNA
libraries (Figure 8c). In addition, unigenes in the
C. sinensis transcriptome were further classified into
four groups by sequence length, and each group was
also aligned against the four uniEST databases. As
expected, longer sequences produced more significant
blast hits (Figure 8b). These results indicated that our
transcriptome data have a high degree of consistency
with previous EST data, yet also represent a significant
increase in coverage.
Gene validation and expression analysis

To experimentally confirm that the unigenes obtained
from sequencing and computational analysis were
indeed expressed, 13 unigenes related to theanine and
flavonoid synthesis were chosen for RT-PCR and qRTPCR analysis (Figure 9a and Figure 9b).
In the RT-PCR analysis, every selected unigene was
PCR positive with a single band at the calculated size
(data not shown). In the qRT-PCR analysis, relative
transcript levels of the unigenes from three different
organs were further compared. In the theanine pathway,
tea homologues of GDH2, GS1-1 and ADC were
expressed much higher in young roots than in leaves
and stems (Figure 9a), with the lowest expression level
in the stems. In comparison, the expression levels of
GS1-2, GGT, glutamate synthase (Fe-GOGAT) and
SAMDC were low in young roots, and high in young
shoots. The results confirmed that the expression of
these selected genes directly correlated with theanine
metabolism.
In the flavonoid pathway, six selected unigenes have
differential expression patterns (Figure 9b). Overall
expression levels of PAL, 4CL, DFR and FNSII were
higher than those of CHS and LCR. The tea homologues
of DFR and PAL were highly expressed in young roots;

Page 13 of 19

4CL expression levels in roots were similar to those in
stems. In contrast, the expression levels of FNSII, CHS
and LCR in leaves were higher than those in roots. The
results of qRT-PCR expression analysis matched the
putative functions of these unigenes.

Discussion
Ultra-high-throughput mRNA sequencing technology is
a fast, efficient, and cost-effective way to characterize
the poly (A)+ transcriptome. It is especially suitable for
gene expression profiling in non-model organisms that
lack genomic sequences. To date, most sequencing
efforts in C. sinensis were based on EST sequencing,
with a limited number of tags reported in public databases. In this study, we applied RNA-seq technology for
C. sinensis transcriptome profiling, in which the poly
(A)+ transcriptome was sequenced on the Illumina GA
IIx platform. We obtained 2.59 G bp coverage with 34.5
million high-quality reads. We generated a total of
127,094 unigenes (≥100 bp) by de novo assembly.
Among them, 55,088 assembled unigenes were annotated. Our coverage is approximately 10-fold more than
all C. sinensis sequences deposited in GenBank combined (as of August 2010).
Since C. sinensis is self-incompatible and recalcitrant
to genetic manipulations, little genetic or genomic information is currently available. Therefore, instead of a
comprehensive in-depth investigation of the tea transcriptome, our experiment was designed to generate a
quick landscape view. A number of strategies were
adopted to obtain sufficient coverage of expressed transcripts, to improve the accuracy of de novo assembly,
and to increase the effectiveness of the gene annotations. First, experimental materials for RNA preparation
came from seven organs of the tea plant, which were
selected to acquire as comprehensive coverage as possible. Second, an Illumina library was constructed based
on the fragmenting RNA method, which has been
shown both to reduce the amount of RNA secondary
structure and 5’ bias and to have better overall uniformity [11]. Third, a paired-end library sequencing strategy was applied not only to increase the sequencing
depth, but also to improve the efficiency of de novo
assembly. Finally, all six public databases were selected
for gene annotation comparisons in order to acquire
complete functional information.
As a result, 55,088 unigenes (43.3% of all assembled unigenes) returned significant hits from BLAST comparisons
with the six public databases. These unigenes were
assigned not only gene or protein name descriptions, but
also putative conserved domains, gene ontology terms and
metabolic pathways. Detailed functional information is
important to understand overall expression profiles of C.
sinensis. In particular, the number of unigenes that hit all

six public databases summed up to 9,139. Because these
genes had relatively unambiguous annotation, they were
selected for tea-specific pathway analyses. The remaining
72,006 unigenes (56.7% of all assembled unigenes) did not
generate significant homology to existing genes. The
absence of homology could be caused by several factors.
Obviously, a large proportion (82.1%) of unigenes was
shorter than 500 bp, some of which were too short to
allow statistically meaningful matches. However, for some
unigenes, the absence of homologous sequences in the
public databases may indicate specific roles for them in C.
sinensis. We are currently cataloging the longer unigenes
(≥500 bp; 22,757 unigenes) in tea plants.
The annotated unigenes were used to study primary
and secondary metabolic pathways. For the four primary
metabolic pathways investigated, all essential structural
genes were found (Additional File 3). The putative

pathway genes from tea were highly similar to those
from the model dicot plant Arabidopsis or other dicot
plants. We also analyzed six families of house-keeping
genes to evaluate the completeness of our transcriptome
coverage. More than 70.5% of these high copy number
genes had full-length ORFs. We believe future largescale sequencing efforts on tea genome and transcriptome will increase the coverage of our dataset even
further.
The quality of tea in large part depends on its metabolic profiles. We focused on flavonoids, theanine and
caffeine biosynthesis for additional analyses. We were
able to find almost all metabolic genes from these pathways (Figure 7 and Additional File 4). Many of these
genes appeared to form multi-gene families. It implies
that the tea genome, like many other higher plants, went
through one or more round of genome duplications

Shi et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:131

structural enzymes to validate our gene annotations.
Each one of them generated the expected band size by
RT-PCR, and qRT-PCR analysis showed consistent
expression patterns. We are confident that our transcriptome dataset is a valuable addition to the publicly
available tea genomic information.

during evolution. C. sinensis has a diploid genome, thus,
extensive genome re-arrangement might have occurred.
We are interested in using SNPs analysis to better understand the genome structure when more RNA-seq data
has been obtained.
A few genes are currently missing in these pathways,
which might be due to their low expression, insufficient
sampling, or ineffective annotations. Some of these
genes, such as guanosine deaminase and N-methylnucleosidase, have not been reported in plants before. On
the other hand, we found some genes that might play
important roles in the above mentioned pathways. For
example, many glycosylation enzymes and cytochrome
P450 genes were discovered in the transcriptome, which
might contribute to the extensive modifications of various secondary compounds found in tea leaf extracts.
By comparing our transcriptome data with four previously prepared cDNA libraries analyzed by EST
sequencing, we showed that the number of unigenes
from RNA-seq was approximate 20 times more than the
existing cDNA libraries. Yet, a small number of genes
discovered in the cDNA libraries did not generate
BLAST hits in the Illumina transcriptome, which could
be resolved by increasing the sequencing depth, enhancing the accuracy of the assembly, and perfecting gene
annotation strategies. We have selected two sets of

Conclusions
Using Illumina sequencing technology, we surveyed the
poly (A) + transcriptome of C. sinensis at an unprecedented depth (2.59 gigabase pairs) and produced 127,094
assembled unigenes with 55,088 unigenes obtaining annotation. To our knowledge, our results represent approximately 10-fold more genes than all C. sinensis genes
deposited in GenBank (as of August 2010) and approximate 20 times more than the existing C. sinensis cDNA
libraries. This study demonstrated that the Illumina
sequencing technology could be applied as a rapid and
cost-effective method for de novo transcriptome analysis
of non-model plant organisms without prior genome
annotation. These findings provided a comprehensive
enough coverage to discover almost all known genes of
several major metabolic pathways, which also serves as a
substantial contribution to existing sequence resources
for the tea plant. We believe that this transcriptome dataset will serve as an important public information platform
to accelerate research of gene expression, genomics, and
functional genomics in C. sinensis.
Methods
RNA preparation

Total RNA was extracted by modified CTAB method
[57] from seven different tissues of the tea plant [Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze cv. Longjing 43], including
tender shoots, young leaves, mature leaves, stems, young
roots, flower buds and immature seeds which were
snap-frozen and stored at -70°C until processing. RNA
integrity was confirmed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with a minimum integrity number value of 8.
Equal amounts of total RNA from each tissue were
pooled together for cDNA preparation.
Preparation of cDNA library for transcriptome sequencing

The poly (A)+ RNA was isolated from 20 μg of the total
RNA pool using Dynal oligo(dT) 25 beads (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Following
purification, the mRNA was fragmented into smaller
pieces at 70°C for 5 min in the fragmentation buffer
(Ambion) and reverse-transcribed to synthesize first
strand cDNA using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase
(Invitrogen) and N6 random hexamers (Takara). Subsequently, second strand cDNA was synthesized using
RNase H (Invitrogen) and DNA polymerase (Invitrogen).
These cDNA fragments were further processed by an end

repair using T4 DNA polymerase, Klenow DNA polymerase, and T4 polynucleotide kinase (NEB), and ligation of
adaptors with Illumina’s adaptor oligo mix and T4 DNA
ligase (Invitrogen). The products were purified for the
section of approximate 200 bp long using Qiaquick Gel
Extraction Kit (Qiagen) and enriched with PCR for preparing the sequencing library. The cDNA library was
detected by Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer.
Illumina sequencing

The cDNA library was sequenced from both of 5’ and 3’
ends on the Illumina GA IIx platform according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The fluorescent images process to sequences, base-calling and quality value calculation were performed by the Illumina data processing
pipeline (version 1.4), in which 75 bp paired-end reads
were obtained.
De novo assembly of sequencing reads and sequence
clustering

Before assembly, the raw reads were filtered to obtain
the high-quality clean reads by removing adaptor
sequences, duplication sequences, the reads containing
more than 10% “N” rate (the “N” character representing
ambiguous bases in reads), and low-quality reads containing more than 50% bases with Q-value ≤ 5. The
Q-value is the quality score assigned to each base by the
Illumina’s base-caller Bustard from the Illumina pipeline
software suite (version 1.4), similar to the Phred score
of the base call. De novo assembly of the clean reads
was performed using SOAPdenovo program (version
1.03, http://soap.genomics.org.cn) which implements a
de Bruijn graph algorithm and a stepwise strategy [28].
Briefly, the clean reads were firstly split into smaller
pieces, the ‘k-mers’, for assembly to produce contigs
using the de Bruijn graph. The resultant contigs would
be further joined into scaffolds using the paired-end
reads. Gap fillings were subsequently carried out to
obtain the complete scaffolds using the paired-end
information to retrieve read pairs that had one read
well-aligned on the contigs and another read located in
the gap region [58]. To reduce any sequence redundancy, the scaffolds were clustered using the Gene
Indices Clustering Tools (copyright(c), http://compbio.
dfci.harvard.edu/tgi/software/) [29]. The clustering output was passed to CAP3 assembler [56] for multiple
alignment and consensus building. Others that can not
reach the threshold set and fall into any assembly
should remain as a list of singletons.
Functional annotation and classification

All Illumina assembled unigenes (consensuses and singletons) longer than 200 bp were annotated by the assignments of putative gene descriptions, conserved domains,

Page 16 of 19

Gene Ontology terms, and putative metabolic pathways
to them based on sequence similarity with previously
identified genes annotated with those details. For assignments of predicted gene descriptions, the assembled unigenes were compared to the plant protein dataset of NR,
the Arabidopsis protein dataset of NR, and Swiss-Prot/
Uniprot protein database respectively using BLASTALL
procedure (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/executables/
release/2.2.18/) with a significant threshold of E-value ≤
10-5. To parse the features of the best BLASTX hits from
the alignments, putative gene names, ‘CDS’, and predicted proteins of corresponding assembled sequences
can be produced. At the same time, the orientation of
Illumina sequences which failed to be obtained directly
from sequencing can be derived from BLAST annotations. For other sequences falling beyond the BLAST,
ESTScan program (version 3.0.1, http://www.ch.embnet.
org/software/ESTScan.html) was used to predict the
‘CDS’ and orientation of them. And then, since a large
portion of assembled unigenes have not yet been annotated, conserved domains/families were further identified
in the assembled unigenes using the InterPro database
(version 30.0, HMMpfam, HMMsmart, HMMpanther,
FPrintScan, ProfileScan, and BlastProDom) [30], Pfam
database (version 24.0) [32] and Clusters of Orthologous
Groups database at NCBI (as of December 2009, ftp://ftp.
ncbi.nih.gov/pub/wolf/COGs/) [33]. Domain-based comparisons with the InterPro, Pfam and COGs databases
were performed using InterProScan (version 4.5, ftp://ftp.
ebi.ac.uk/pub/software/unix/iprscan/), HMMER3 (http://
hmmer.janelia.org) and BLAST programs (E-value threshold: 10-5), respectively. Functional categorization by Gene
Ontology terms (GO; http://www.geneontology.org) [34]
was carried out based on two sets of best BLASTX hits
from both the plant and Arabidopsis protein datasets of
NR database using Blast2GO software (version 2.3.5,
http://www.blast2go.de/) [35] with E-value threshold of
10-5. The KEGG pathways annotation was performed by
sequence comparisons against the Kyoto Encyclopedia of
Genes and Genomes database [36] using BLASTX algorithm (E-value threshold: 10-5).
Files containing the raw read sequences and their
quality scores are available from the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Short Read Archive
with the accession number: SRX020193. The assembled
sequences (longer than 150 bp) have been deposited in
the Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly Sequence Database (TSA) at NCBI with the accession numbers:
HP701085-HP777243.
Analysis of metabolic pathway genes using C. sinensis
unigenes

Genes involved in four primary pathways (glycolysis,
citrate cycle, pentose phosphate cycle, and Calvin cycle

Shi et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:131
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/131

and photosynthesis pathways) and three secondary
metabolic pathways (flavonoid biosynthesis, theanine
biosynthesis, and caffeine biosynthesis pathways) that
are related to tea quality were analyzed using C. sinensis
unigenes as illustrated in Figure 6. They were firstly
searched based on standard gene names and synonyms
in the combined functional annotations, and each search
result was further confirmed with BLAST searches.
BLAST searches were performed by the alignments of
Arabidopsis or other dicot protein sequences from the
public databases against corresponding genes obtained
from keyword searches using the local TBLASTN alignments with an E-value threshold of 1e-5. If no hits can
be produced from TBLASTN alignments, Arabidopsis or
other dicot nucleotide sequences should be downloaded
and used for additional TBLASTX alignments (E-value
threshold: 1e -5 ). The identical results from keyword
searches and BLAST searches can be used to predict
that these genes could be expressed in C. sinensis. To
discover new genes, all searched unigenes were analyzed
by BLAST alignments against the existing tea uniEST
database [5-7].
Six kinds of housekeeping genes were also searched by
the combination method of simple text searches and
BLAST searches. The ORFs of the selected housekeeping genes were predicted using the online ORF finder
program (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gorf/gorf.html),
and their homology to the model dicot plant Arabidopsis or other dicot plants were also analyzed.
Comparisons with four Camellia cDNA libraries

The four Camellia cDNA libraries based on conventional
Sanger sequencing were selected for the comparisons
with C. sinensis transcriptome. The corresponding EST
sequences from the four cDNA libraries were downloaded from the available Camellia ESTs in GenBank,
including the EST sequences from the young root cDNA
library of the tea plant (C. sinensis) submitted by our
laboratory [7] (GenBank accession: GE652554.1FE861258.1), two reported C. sinensis cDNA library
respectively named subtractive cDNA library special for
young leaves of the tea plant [5](GenBank accession:
CV699876.1-CV699527.1) and the young leaf cDNA
library of the tea plant [6](GenBank accession:
CV067174.1-CV013548.1), and another drought-stressed
root SSH cDNA library of C. sinensis var. assamica (GenBank accession:GW316945.1-GT969202.1). All EST
sequences were assembled by Cap3 procedure [56] to
obtain uniESTs with overlap length cutoff of 30nt and
overlap percent identity parameter of 80. Comparisons of
the C. sinensis transcriptome with the four Camellia
cDNA libraries were performed with local BLASTN and
TBLASTX procedures (1e-5 cut-off), respectively.

Gene validation and expression analysis

Thirteen selected unigenes with potential roles in theanine and flavonoid synthesis were chosen for validation
using real time qPCR with gene specific primers
designed with primer premier software (version 5.0)
(Additional File 6). Total RNA was extracted from
young roots, stems and young shoots of the tea plant
using a modified CTAB method [57] and purified with
RNA purification kit (Tiangen, China). One microgram
of total RNA was used in reverse transcription in total
volume of 20 μL in the presence of 6-mer random primer and oligo primer according to the protocol of Taraka. The standard curve for each gene was obtained by
real-time PCR with several dilutions of cDNA. The reaction was performed in 20 μL, containing 10 μL 2×SYBR
Green Mastermix (Taraka), 300 nM each primer and 2
μL 10-fold diluted cDNA template.
The PCR reactions were run in Bio-Rad Sequence
Detection System using the following program: 95°C for
10 s and 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, anneal at 60°C for
30 s. Consequently, the specificity of the individual PCR
amplification was checked using a heat dissociation protocol from 55 to 95°C following the final cycle of the
PCR and agarose gel electrophoresis. Triplicates of each
reaction were performed, and actin gene was chosen as
an internal control for normalization after comparison
the expressions of four reference genes (actin, GAPDH,
18S and b- tubulin) in different organs. Quantifying the
relative expression of the genes in three different organs
was performed using the delta-delta C t method as
described by Livak and Schmittgen [59]. All data were
expressed as the mean ± SD after normalization.
