Abstract
Background: Novel immune-type receptor (NITR) genes are members of diversified multigene
families that are found in bony fish and encode type I transmembrane proteins containing one or
two extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig) domains. The majority of NITRs can be classified as
inhibitory receptors that possess cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs
(ITIMs). A much smaller number of NITRs can be classified as activating receptors by the lack of
cytoplasmic ITIMs and presence of a positively charged residue within their transmembrane
domain, which permits partnering with an activating adaptor protein.
Results: Forty-four NITR genes in medaka (Oryzias latipes) are located in three gene clusters on
chromosomes 10, 18 and 21 and can be organized into 24 families including inhibitory and activating
forms. The particularly large dataset acquired in medaka makes direct comparison possible to
another complete dataset acquired in zebrafish in which NITRs are localized in two clusters on
different chromosomes. The two largest medaka NITR gene clusters share conserved synteny with
the two zebrafish NITR gene clusters. Shared synteny between NITRs and CD8A/CD8B is limited
but consistent with a potential common ancestry.
Conclusion: Comprehensive phylogenetic analyses between the complete datasets of NITRs from
medaka and zebrafish indicate multiple species-specific expansions of different families of NITRs.
The patterns of sequence variation among gene family members are consistent with recent birthand-death events. Similar effects have been observed with mammalian immunoglobulin (Ig), T cell
antigen receptor (TCR) and killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) genes. NITRs likely
diverged along an independent pathway from that of the somatically rearranging antigen binding
receptors but have undergone parallel evolution of V family diversity.

Background

Results

The two major forms of novel immune-type receptors
(NITRs) possess either one N-terminal ectodomain of the
Ig variable (V) type, which may contain a joining (J) or Jlike sequence or an N-terminal V domain plus a second Cterminal Ig domain of the intermediate (I) type. Most
NITRs are predicted to encode type I transmembrane cell
surface proteins that possess extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig) domains and can be classified as inhibitory or activating. A smaller number of NITR genes lack a
transmembrane domain and are predicted to be secreted
proteins [1,2]. NITRs are expressed in several different
hematopoietic lineages [3,4] and their overall structure
and cytoplasmic signaling resemble the mammalian natural killer cell receptors (e.g. KIRs) [1,5,6]. NITRs have
been reported to bind allogeneic cell surface targets,
although their precise ligand specificity is not clear [Cannon et al., unpublished observations and [7]]. Other
observations, including upregulation of transcription in
response to pathogens, support a role for NITRs in immunity [8].

Medaka encode 44 NITRs on three chromosomes
The reduced levels of protein sequence identity between
NITRs found in different species make it difficult to identify genetic orthologs between fish species outside of conserved core residues. In order to identify NITR genes from
medaka, we data mined the recently released medaka
genome database [16,17]. By using zebrafish NITR
sequences as queries, it was possible to identify a number
of candidate genes that encode Ig domains. By then
restricting the queries only to genes that encode an
authentic NITR I-type domain [14], NITR gene clusters
were identified on medaka chromosomes 10, 18 and 21.
The search was then directed to include all genes predicted
to encode V domains in these genomic regions. In total,
10 NITR genes were identified on chromosome 10; 30
NITR genes and three pseudogenes (defined as possessing
a stop codon within the V or I domain) were identified on
chromosome 18; and one NITR gene and one pseudogene
were identified on chromosome 21 (Figure 1 and Additional File 1). Three additional NITR genes (NITR8b,
NITR10b and NITR12b) cannot be assigned to a specific
chromosome. It is possible that certain genes described
here may represent allelic variants and that additional
NITR genes may be identified in future releases of the
medaka genome.

NITRs were identified initially in the compact genome of
the Southern pufferfish (Spheroides nephelus); more than
26 NITR genes were shown to be encoded in a single gene
cluster [9,10]. Subsequent analysis of the zebrafish (Danio
rerio) genome revealed one large NITR gene cluster encoding 36 NITRs on chromosome 7 and a second smaller
NITR gene cluster encoding 3 NITRs on chromosome 14
[2,11]. NITR cDNAs also have been characterized from
channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) [3,4,12,13] and it is assumed that they are present
in all bony fish. The majority of NITRs possess cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs
(ITIMs); inhibitory functions have been confirmed in vitro
[14]. A smaller number of NITRs possess a positively
charged residue within their transmembrane domain and
have been shown to interact with Dap12 through which
they mediate an activating function [15].
We herein report the identification of 44 medaka (Oryzias
latipes) NITR genes, which can be classified into 24 families including inhibitory and activating forms; this represents nearly twice the number of NITR families that have
been identified in any other species. The resolution of this
dataset of NITRs along with the previous genomic resolution of NITRs in zebrafish permits a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis as well as the examination of shared
synteny. The NITRs emerge as independent families of
immune-type receptors in which the evolution of the V
regions exhibit considerable similarity to that seen in multigene families encoding Ig, TCRs and KIRs.

The 44 NITR genes that were identified can be grouped
into 24 V families, based on >70% predicted amino acid
sequence identity (Figure 2a and Additional File 2).
Twelve families consist of multiple (up to five) members
and the remaining families are singletons. Each NITR family was assigned a number and for families with multiple
members, each member was assigned a letter (e.g.
NITR1a, NITR1b, etc.) as described [2]. With the exception of the NITR9 family (see below) in which activating
potential (rather than V structure) served as the basis for
assignment to a specific gene family, unequivocal
orthologs between the NITRs of medaka and any other
species were not identified and the numbering of these
genes was arbitrary.
Two major classes of NITR gene organization
All of the NITR genes currently described from the Southern pufferfish and 11 NITR genes from a second pufferfish
species, Tetraodon nigroviridis (Additional file 3), encode
two Ig domains (V and I domains) in a single exon [10].
In contrast, all of the two-Ig domain NITR genes described
from zebrafish encode the V and I domains in two exons
[2]. Both types of NITR gene organization are present in
medaka (Figure 2). The medaka NITR genes encoding two
Ig domains in a single exon are all located on chromosomes 18 and 21; the medaka NITR genes encoding two
Ig domains in two exons are located on chromosome 10

with the exception of the NITR9 genes, which are on chromosome 18.
Twenty-one full-length NITR cDNAs were cloned from
medaka kidney and spleen by 3' RACE using nested primers that include the predicted translational start codon
(Additional Files 4 and 5) in order to verify the exonintron boundaries for the NITRs. The predicted exonintron boundaries most often were verified; however, in
several cases, predicted mRNA splice sites were inexact,
reflected slight differences in cDNA sequence. It is likely
that the genome from inbred Hd-rR medaka and cDNAs
from the out-bred orange-red medaka line possess different alleles for certain NITRs. For example, the identification of a NITR6 cDNA from the orange-red line confirms
that the NITR6 genes possess a cytoplasmic tail; however,
the cDNA cytoplasmic sequence is too divergent to confidently predict these exons from the Hd-rR genome. In
addition the orange-red NITR12 cDNA encodes addi-

tional nucleotide sequences that are not present in the
Hd-rR genome resulting in a stop codon preventing translation of an ITIM-like sequence (itim) in the cDNA (Additional File 6).
Structural features of medaka NITRs
The initial search criteria for identifying medaka NITRs
was directed to the I domain, which possesses six highly
conserved cysteines. NITR22 and NITR23 lack the sixth
and third cysteines, respectively (Figure 3). A joining (J;
FGXGTXLXV) or J-like peptide sequence at the carboxylterminus of either the V and/or the I domain is a conserved feature of nearly all medaka NITRs (Figures 3 and
4 and Additional File 7). The majority of NITRs in medaka
and other species can be classified as inhibitory based on
the presence of one or two cytoplasmic ITIM or itim
sequences (Figure 4 and Additional File 8) as well as by
the absence of a charged transmembrane residue, a conserved feature of activating receptors. In medaka, three

closely related NITR genes (NITR9a, NITR9b and NITR9c)
possess a charged residue (Arg) within their transmembrane domain corresponding to activating NITRs in other
species such as Nitr9, the single activating NITR gene in
zebrafish (Additional File 9) [2,15].
NITR gene clusters in medaka and zebrafish share
conserved synteny
The complete annotation of NITRs in zebrafish and
medaka permits the investigation of potential shared synteny. The larger zebrafish NITR gene cluster on chromosome 7 is adjacent to the map4k2l, men1 and rtn3 genes [2]
and the larger medaka NITR gene cluster is linked to these
genes on chromosome 18 (Table 1). The second smaller

zebrafish NITR gene cluster on chromosome 14 is adjacent to the fgfrl1b gene [11] and the medaka NITR gene
cluster on chromosome 10 is tightly linked to
FGFRL1(2of2) within the same contig (Figure 5). (Medaka
and zebrafish possess two FGFRL1 orthologs referred to as
fgfrl1a and fgfrl1b in zebrafish and fgfrl1(1of2) and
fgfrl1(2of2) in medaka). Medaka orthologs of additional
genes adjacent to the NITR gene cluster on zebrafish chromosome 14 are also encoded on medaka chromosome 10
(Table 1). These observations indicate that the NITR gene
clusters on medaka chromosome 18 and zebrafish chromosome 7 share conserved synteny whereas the NITR
gene cluster on medaka chromosome 10 and zebrafish
chromosome 14 share conserved synteny. The origin of

NITRs have not been identified outside of bony fish and
their evolutionary origins remain unresolved. The
genomes of human, chicken, Xenopus tropicalis and a third
fish species stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) were queried in an effort to identify genomic regions, which share

conserved synteny with the NITR gene clusters. In
medaka, zebrafish and stickleback, one NITR gene cluster
is linked to SPON2 and FGFRL1 orthologs. In chicken and
Xenopus the SPON2 and FGFRL1 genes are physically
linked to the CD8A/CD8B locus (Figure 5). SPON2/
FGFRL1 and CD8A/CD8B genes are on different chromosomes in human. In medaka, zebrafish and stickleback
the CD8A/CD8B locus does not display conserved synteny
to human (Additional File 10). The observation that
SPON2 and FGFRL are linked to the CD8 locus in chicken
and Xenopus and that SPON2 and FGFRL orthologs are
linked to a NITR gene cluster in medaka, zebrafish and

stickleback is consistent with a common ancestry for these
immune-type molecules.
Medaka NITR24 is tightly linked to a CTLA4 ortholog
The NITR24 locus on medaka chromosome 21 is separated from the V-domain receptor CTLA4 by ~0.1 Mb. A
small number of predicted olfactory receptor genes lie
between CTLA4 and NITR24 (Additional File 11).
Although mammalian CTLA4 is tightly linked to CD28, a
structurally similar receptor, these genes do not appear to
be closely linked in bony fish [18]. Neither NITR gene
cluster in zebrafish is linked to CTLA4 or CD28.
Species-specific expansions of NITR families
In general, most NITRs from a single species lack clear
orthologs in other species. The absence of such comparison sets skews multi-species phylogenetic comparisons as
not all NITR members from each species (and family)

have been identified. Three major inferences can be made
from the data described here (Additional File 12) and
other observations predicted previously: 1) the activating
receptors, medaka NITR9, zebrafish Nitr9, and catfish
IpNITR2, group together suggesting a common ancestry;
2) the majority of the NITRs encoding both V and I
domains within a single exon (medaka, Southern pufferfish and Tetraodon) group together, suggesting that they
are likely derived from a common ancestral gene; and 3)
the majority of the NITRs, which lack an I domain (from
medaka, zebrafish, catfish, and Tetraodon), group
together, suggesting that they too may be derived from a
common ancestral gene.
Multiple species-specific expansions of individual NITR
families are revealed by comparing the two complete
NITR datasets from medaka and zebrafish (Figure 6). For
example, the medaka NITR gene cluster on chromosome

18 includes expansions of the NITR1, NITR2, NITR3 and
NITR5 families and the corresponding zebrafish NITR
gene cluster on chromosome 7 includes expansions of the
divergent nitr1, nitr2 and nitr3 families. Three NITRs are
encoded by the zebrafish NITR gene cluster on chromosome 14 whereas 10 NITRs are encoded by the corresponding gene cluster in medaka suggesting either gene
loss in zebrafish or gene duplications in medaka.

Discussion
Interpreting the evolution of NITRs within teleost species
Forty-four different NITR genes, the majority of which are
inhibitory, are present in the medaka genome. Perhaps
the most striking observation relates to the high degree of
variation between these V domains within medaka and
their diversification from NITRs in other fish species. This
finding is particularly striking given the exceptionally
large number of V families in medaka, i.e., the greater the
number of V families present, the higher the expectations
of identifying orthologous sequences. The medaka/
zebrafish chromosomes 18/7 and 10/14, which encode
the larger NITR gene clusters, exhibit a high degree of conserved synteny [16]. Medaka chromosomes 10 and 18,
and zebrafish chromosomes 7 and 14 likely derive from a
hypothetical ancestral chromosome termed "f" which was
duplicated prior to the divergence of medaka and
zebrafish [16]. Although the nucleotide identity is low
between medaka and zebrafish NITR genes (confounding
the confident assignment of genetic orthologs), conserved
synteny between the two primary medaka and zebrafish
NITR gene clusters is impressive.

Comparisons of predicted amino acid sequence structures
within and between different species indicate that NITRs
are undergoing family-specific expansions and individual
genes are undergoing birth and death events. As the NITR

gene products are highly diverse within a single species
(Figures 3 and 4) and approximately 10% of the NITRs
described in medaka can be classified as pseudogenes
(Figure 1), it is less likely that concerted evolution played
a primary role in establishing the current NITR sequences
[19]. Birth and death events of NITR genes likely have
been occurring continuously after the divergence of
medaka and zebrafish ~323 MYA [16]. Similar observations have been made concerning the V gene segments of
the Ig and TCR genes [20] and the KIR genes within primate species [reviewed by [21]]. The KIR gene family is of
particular value in comparative interpretations as they
also represent type I, Ig domain-containing membrane
proteins with potential for inhibitory and activating signalling. KIRs are highly polymorphic and polygenic
within single species and drastically diverged in gene
sequence and number between different primates [21].
The nature of diversity in KIRs is markedly similar to that
observed in the NITRs of medaka and zebrafish. The studies reported here suggest that particularly extensive expansion and diversification of the NITRs have occurred in
bony fish. Deducing the status of the NITR gene family
from the genomes of more basal fish species (such as gar
or sturgeon) will be highly informative regarding the origins of diversity within the NITR family.
Possible links between NITRs and mammalian receptors
All evidence to date strongly suggests that NITRs are
restricted to bony fish. Although NITRs possess authentic
V (and frequently V-J) domains reminiscent of TCR, their
overall structure, genomic organization and the presence
of both activating and inhibitory forms, has led to the
hypothesis that they may be functional equivalents to
mammalian NK receptors, resembling in some way KIRs.
We previously reported that the zebrafish NITR gene cluster on chromosome 7 shares a limited syntenic relation-

physically linked in human but are linked in (b) chicken and (c) Xenopus. SPON2 and FGFRL1 orthologs in (d) medaka, (e) stickleback and (f) zebrafish are not linked to CD8A/CD8B, but are linked to a NITR gene cluster. FGFRL1(1of2) and FGFRL1(2of2) in
medaka and stickleback and fgfrl1a and fgfrl1b in zebrafish represent paralogs of FGFRL1. Note the expansion of CD8A-like
genes in chicken [22]. Gene names and chromosomal order were identified via Contig View within the Ensembl Genome
Browser [28], with the exception of Xenopus CD8B. Data were acquired using release NCBI 36 of the human genome, release
2.1 of the chicken genome, release 4.1 of the Xenopus tropicalis genome, release 1.0 of the medaka genome and release Zv7 of
the zebrafish genome. The location of Xenopus tropicalis CD8B was determined by Jacques Robert and Alexander Taranin (personal communication).

ship with the mammalian leukocyte receptor cluster
(LRC) that includes the KIRs [14]. The new data presented
here introduces two alternative models in which the
NITRs share a common ancestry with CD8A/CD8B or
with CD28/CTLA4. An expansion of CD8A-like genes was
recently described within the chicken CD8A/CD8B locus;

the reported structural similarity between the V-like
domains of the CD8A-like receptors and NITRs supports
the former model [22]. Although intriguing, the latter
model is not as well supported. Specifically, in mammals
CD28 and CTLA4 effect opposing roles in T-cell stimulation and are encoded by adjacent genes. However, the

possibility that they may be involved in cytotoxic interactions. Ongoing efforts to identify NITR ligands and define
cell populations that express NITRs in vivo will prove crucial in deciphering their role in immunity. In particular,
such studies will determine whether their function is analogous to mammalian processes (NK recognition) or represents a unique adaptation within bony fish.

CD28 and CTLA4 genes are not physically linked in teleosts. Linkage of an NITR gene to CTLA4 has not been identified outside of medaka; in zebrafish the NITR gene
clusters are on chromosomes 7 and 14 [2,11]. CTLA4 and
CD28 genes in zebrafish are located on chromosomes 9
and 1, respectively [18].
KIRs, CD8, CD28 and CTLA4 are expressed by cytotoxic
lymphocytes and NITRs are similarly expressed in lymphoid populations including NK-like cytotoxic cells
[unpublished observations and [3,4]]. In general, inhibitory natural killer cells receptors (NKRs) repress cytotoxicity by recognition of MHC or other markers of "self" on
candidate target cells whereas activating NKRs induce
cytotoxicity by detecting a loss of "self" or a gain of "nonself" (e.g. viral or stress-related peptides). In at least one
case, a NITR specifically engages a non-self determinant
(Cannon et al., unpublished observations), suggesting the

The medaka genome encodes 44 NITR genes in 3 gene
clusters. NITR genes in this species are divergent in
sequence but structurally similar to those characterized in
other fish species and include both inhibitory and activating forms. Comparative genomics reveals three possible
scenarios in which the NITRs share a common genetic
ancestry with CD8, CD28/CTLA4 or KIRs. A comparison
of the complete sets of NITRs from medaka and zebrafish
indicate that: 1) the two largest NITR gene clusters in
medaka and zebrafish are derived from a whole chromosome duplication event, 2) as a gene family, the NITRs
have experienced recent, species-specific "birth and
death" events and 3) NITR family expansions have led to
high levels of sequence variation between fish species.

Methods
Data mining
Using zebrafish nitr1c and nitr3a as queries, putative
medaka NITR genes were identified by searching version
1.0 of the medaka genome [23]. Manual annotation of
these medaka genes was performed using FSPLICE to predict splice sites (GT/AG) and FGENESH+ to predict structures based on homology with zebrafish and other
medaka NITR genes: "fish" specific parameters were
applied to both programs which are included in the
MolQuest software suite [24]. SEQtools was used to visualize the predicted transcripts and their three-frame translations [25]. In addition, V and I domain predictions were
validated by searching the NCBI non-redundant database
with BLAST [26], while transmembrane predictions were
validated using the TMHMM 2.0 server [27]. Lastly,
groups of medaka NITRs were defined through BLASTCLUST (single-linkage) based on sharing 70% identity
within the peptide sequence of the V-domain. Orthologous genes and their genomic positions were identified in
medaka, zebrafish, stickleback, Xenopus tropicalis, chicken,
mouse and human genomes using ContigView software
within the Ensembl genome browser [28].
Phylogenetic analyses
Published NITR V or I domains were aligned by ClustalW

Rapid Amplification of cDNA ends
Tissues from young adult (6–9 month), out-bred, orangered medaka were dissected directly into RNA-Bee and total
RNA purified as recommended by the manufacturer (TelTest, Friendswood, TX). Two μg of RNA (1 μg from kidney
and 1 μg from spleen) were reverse transcribed using the
oligo dT primer and Superscript™ III Reverse Transcriptase
supplied with the GeneRacer™ kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA). Nested, forward primers were designed against the
exons encoding predicted leader sequences of medaka
NITRs and 3' RACE was completed as recommended in
the GeneRacer kit. Primer sequences are listed in Additional File 4. PCR products were cloned into pCRII-TOPO
(Invitrogen) or pGEM-T Easy (Promega, Madison, WI)
and sequenced.

Tetraodon nigroviridis encode multiple NITRs. Putative NITR genes
and gene transcripts were identified from Tetraodon nigroviridis by a
tBLASTn search using a Spheroides nephelus NITR1 protein sequence
[GenBank:AAF28781] as a query. This strategy identified six candidate
Tetraodon cDNAs [GenBank:CR683680, GenBank:CR675622, GenBank:CR664265, GenBank:CR725053, GenBank:CR724466, and
GenBank:CR707240] and a single genomic BAC clone B22K12 [GenBank:BX629355]. Only one of these cDNAs [GenBank:CR683680]
appears to include an entire ORF. The partial protein sequences encoded
by [GenBank:CR675622] and [GenBank:CR664265] are identical. The
partial protein sequences encoded by [GenBank:CR725053] and [GenBank:CR724466] differ at three predicted amino acids residues; [GenBank:CR725053] is 10 amino acids longer at the amino-terminus. BAC
B22K12 encodes 12 different NITR genes (designated by their nucleotide
location in the reverse complement position within BAC B22K12). The
predicted protein sequences of four representative NITR cDNAs are
aligned relative to the predicted protein sequences of the NITRs encoded
by BAC B22K12. Note that NITR-116851 (BAC B22K12) is predicted
to encode a V domain and lacks an I domain.

Classification of medaka NITR cDNAs. Neighbor-joining tree of V
domains encoded by out-bred, orange-red medaka NITR cDNAs (highlighted in yellow) and predicted NITR V domains from the genome of the
inbred Hd-rR medaka. The number assigned to each interior branch corresponds to the bootstrap value. Branch lengths correspond to the number
of amino acid substitutions estimated by Poisson correction, scale indicated below.

The CD8 locus does not display conserved synteny between medaka,
zebrafish, stickleback and human. Although the CD8A and CD8B genes
are tightly linked in (a) medaka, (b) zebrafish, (c) stickleback and (d)
human, flanking genes are not well conserved between fish and human.
Data were acquired using release NCBI 36 of the human genome, release
1.0 of the medaka genome, release Zv7 of the zebrafish genome and
release 1.0 of the stickleback genome.

Variation between the medaka NITR12 cDNA and genomic sequence. A
partial alignment of NITR12 cDNA from out-bred, orange-red medaka to
the predicted coding sequence of the NITR12a gene from inbred Hd-rR
medaka. Predicted peptide sequence is shown above (cDNA) and below
(genomic DNA) the alignment. The sequences shown include a portion of
the transmembrane domain exon and the two cytoplasmic domain exons.
Dashes indicate gaps in the nucleotide alignment. Asterisks indicate
nucleotide identity. Stop codons are indicated by red highlighting in the
nucleotide sequence and by dashes in the protein sequence. Downward
arrowheads define predicted RNA splice sites. The NITR12 cDNA
encodes additional nucleotide sequences that are not present in the
genomic sequence (nucleotides highlighted in pink). Although the
NITR12a genomic sequence is predicted to encode an ITIM (highlighted
in yellow) and a second ITIM-like sequence (itim; highlighted in orange),
differences in the NITR12 cDNA alter the predicted ITIM sequence
(LNYAAL to RYYAAL) and introduce a stop codon, preventing translation of the itim. The differences in predicted protein sequence likely reflect
allelic variations between the out-bred, orange-red transcripts and Hd-rR
genomic sequence.

Medaka NITR24 is linked to CTLA4. (a) Human CTLA4 and CD28 are
tightly linked. (b) In medaka CTLA4 is closely linked to NITR24. Gene
names and chromosomal order were identified via Contig View within the
Ensembl Genome Browser [28]. Three predicted olfactory receptor (OR)
genes are indicated on medaka chromosome 21, although the exact
number of OR genes has not been determined. Data were acquired using
release NCBI 36 of the human genome and release 1.0 of the medaka
genome. CTLA4 and CD28 are not linked to NITR genes in zebrafish
(not shown). Note that Ensembl misidentified medaka CTLA4 [18] as
CD28. Predicted protein structures are shown and structural features are
as in Figure 4 plus cytoplasmic activating motifs (YxxM); and a functionally unresolved motif (YxxH).

encoded by 73 representative NITR genes. Ol, medaka (Oryzias latipes);
Dr, zebrafish (Danio rerio); Ip, channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus);
Om, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss); Sn, Southern pufferfish
(Spheroides nephelus); Po Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) and Tn, pufferfish (Tetraodon nigroviridis). Specific NITR
gene numbers are indicated (e.g. medaka NITR8a = Ol 8a), except for
Tetraodon sequences (see Additional file 3). Only one NITR gene family
member is incorporated; additional family members are indicated in
parenthesis. Activating NITR genes are indicated by a "+"; NITR families
that possess both inhibitory and activating forms are indicated by a "+/-".
NITR genes which encode a V and I domain in a single exon ("V and I
exons fused") and "No I domain" are indicated. These labels are presented
in parentheses for NITR families, which do not consistently conform to
these definitions. Number assigned to each interior branch corresponds to
the bootstrap value; bootstrap values less than 60 are not shown. Branch
lengths correspond to number of amino acid substitutions estimated by
Poisson correction, indicated below.
