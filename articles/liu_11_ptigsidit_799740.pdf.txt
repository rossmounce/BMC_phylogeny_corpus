Abstract
Background: DNA barcoding technology, which uses a short piece of DNA sequence to identify species, has
wide ranges of applications. Until today, a universal DNA barcode marker for plants remains elusive. The rbcL
and matK regions have been proposed as the “core barcode” for plants and the ITS2 and psbA-trnH intergenic
spacer (PTIGS) regions were later added as supplemental barcodes. The use of PTIGS region as a supplemental
barcode has been limited by the lack of computational tools that can handle significant insertions and
deletions in the PTIGS sequences. Here, we compared the most commonly used alignment-based and
alignment-free methods and developed a web server to allow the biologists to carry out PTIGS-based DNA
barcoding analyses.
Results: First, we compared several alignment-based methods such as BLAST and those calculating P distance and
Edit distance, alignment-free methods Di-Nucleotide Frequency Profile (DNFP) and their combinations. We found
that the DNFP and Edit-distance methods increased the identification success rate to ~80%, 20% higher than the
most commonly used BLAST method. Second, the combined methods showed overall better success rate and
performance. Last, we have developed a web server that allows (1) retrieving various sub-regions and the
consensus sequences of PTIGS, (2) annotating novel PTIGS sequences, (3) determining species identity by PTIGS
sequences using eight methods, and (4) examining identification efficiency and performance of the eight methods
for various taxonomy groups.
Conclusions: The Edit distance and the DNFP methods have the highest discrimination powers. Hybrid methods
can be used to achieve significant improvement in performance. These methods can be extended to applications
using the core barcodes and the other supplemental DNA barcode ITS2. To our knowledge, the web server
developed here is the only one that allows species determination based on PTIGS sequences. The web server can
be accessed at http://psba-trnh-plantidit.dnsalias.org.

Background
DNA barcoding technology uses a short piece of DNA
sequence to identify species. In animals, a region of the
COI gene has been found to possess properties like high
PCR amplification efficiency, high DNA sequencing success rate, and high discrimination power. Consequently,
the gene has been selected as the universal DNA barcode. However, in plants, no DNA sequences have been
found to be comparable to the COI in animals. Several
DNA regions such as rbcL, matK, ITS2, ITS, and psbAtrnH have been proposed as potential candidates for
plant DNA barcodes [1-6]. The psbA-trnH intergenic
spacer (PTIGS) region has been successfully used to
resolve problems in species identification in a number
of studies [3,7-10]. As one of the supplemental barcodes,
PTIGS has several favorable characteristics. First, it can
be easily amplified across a broad range of land plants.
Based on the sequences of the conserved coding regions
of psbA and trnH, universal primers can be easily
designed to amplify the PTIGS region. Secondly, the
insertions/deletions of the PTIGS region are common
and lead to various length among different plant groups.
As a result, PTIGS has the highest percentage of nucleotide difference and micro-inversions and it has become
the most variable plastid region in some group of plants
[3,9,11].
Various methods have been tested on simulated or
specific datasets. Using available gymnosperm nrITS2
and plastid matK sequences as a test dataset, Little et al.
have estimated the precision and accuracy of hierarchical clustering methods (parsimony and neighbor joining), similarity methods (BLAST, BLAT, and
megaBLAST), combined clustering/similarity methods
(BLAST/parsimony and BLAST/neighbor joining), diagnostic methods (DNA–BAR and DOME ID) for species
identification [12]. It was found that no method was
able to accurately identify query sequences for species at
a frequency that would be considered useful for routine
specimen identification. The success rate for unambiguously correct identification ranges from 42% to 71%.
More recently, phylogenetic and statistical classification
methods such as neighbor-joining (NJ), PhyML, k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Classification and Regression trees
(CART), Random Forest, and Kernel have been compared based on their performance on DNA barcode analyses using simulated and specific datasets [13]. The
authors found that no method is superior to others,
although the simplest method of all, “one nearest neighbor” was found to be the most reliable. Because of widespread phenomena of monophyly and paraphyly in plant
kingdom, there are no defined borders for many plant
species. Consequently, classification based methods such
as Support Vector Machine (SVM) have not been considered more effective than the nearest neighbor

method. In addition, several studies have applied the
alignment free methods on DNA barcode analyses using
COI[14] or ITS2 [12] as the barcode markers, even
though it is arguable whether these studies are necessary
as COI has little indels and less difficulty in sequence
alignment. It has not been determined whether or not
they can be extended to other markers.
PTIGS sequence has unique characteristics that make
it an important supplemental plant DNA barcode. However, its usage has been limited by the lack of computational tools that allow the easy retrieval and annotation
of the PTIGS sequences, and the subsequent species
identification due to the difficulty in aligning PTIGS
sequences. In this study, we have developed a web server system that tackles these problems, which, hopefully,
will facilitate PTIGS-based DNA barcoding analyses.

Implementation
The methods and their combinations were implemented
using C and Perl programming languages. Perl Catalyst
framework was then used to develop the PITGS-IdIt
web server. All source codes are available upon request.
The performance of the various methods was measured
on a machine with 24G RAM, 8 processors, running
Red Hat 4.1.2-46 operating system.
Results
Algorithms

The current web server has three main functions: (1)
retrieval of PTIGS sequences, (2) annotation of novel
PTIGS sequences, and (3) species identification based
on PTIGS sequences. To allow the easy retrieval of
PTIGS sequences, we downloaded all sequences from
the PTIGS loci in GenBank (Release 178), available from
Additional File 1. Each sequence was divided into the 5’
psbA region, the core PTIGS region, and the 3’ trnH
region based on GenBank annotations. Different
sequences were grouped at various taxonomy levels of
class, order and family, genus, and species, available
from Additional File 2. For each species, the sequences
of all the PTIGS core regions were assembled using
Phrap program (version 0.990319) to generate the consensus sequence, which is considered to be the reference
sequence for each species. All processed sequences are
stored in two dimensions, the sequence regions (the 5’,
core, and 3’) and the taxonomy levels (class, order,
family, genus, and species). The users can easily retrieve
any sequence in the two dimensions. For more details,
please see the corresponding application page.
We found manual annotation of PTIGS regions, that
is, defining the 5’, core, and 3’ regions can be extremely
tedious. To automate this process, we implemented a
Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based annotation
engine. To use this engine, the users need to prepare

two multiple alignments of sequences for the 5’ and 3’
regions respectively. HMM models are built using
hmmbuild (HMMER 2.0) [15,16]. The models are then
used to scan the sequences to be annotated using
hmmsearch (HMMER 2.0). Last, a parser written in Perl
identifies the regions in the sequences that were found
to match the 5’ and 3’ HMM models, completing the
annotation process.
As described above, one particular characteristic of the
PTIGS regions is the presence of significant portions of
indels [3,7,17-19], causing difficulties in multiple
sequence alignment. These indels actually contain the
information that can be used to distinguish the two
sequences, which has been ignored by alignment-based
methods such as BLAST and P distance method (P)
[20-22]. Consequently, we are set to find methods that
include the indels in the comparison of two PTIGS
sequences. To evaluate the performance of these methods, we first constructed a dataset from species that has
at least two PTIGS sequence. This produced a dataset
containing 11137 PTIGS core region sequences (Table 1).
After reviewing various methods, the one that calculates the Edit (E) distance [23,24] was selected. This
method uses dynamic programming techniques to align
two sequences [25], then calculate the number of steps
(i.e. Edit distance) needed to transform one sequence
into the other. The allowed transformation steps include
transition (i.e. converting one nucleotide to another),
insertion and deletion. An alternative solution to include
unaligned regions in sequence comparison is to use the
alignment-free methods as described before [12,14]. In
this study, we implemented such a method by first converting input sequences into vectors of frequencies of
kmers (i.e. short oligonucleotides of size K). Then the
pearson correlation coefficient was calculated for each
pair of vectors as their distance. To find the best
method for PTIGS-based species determination, the E
and kmer-based methods were compared with the other
commonly used methods for species discrimination,
namely, BLAST and P distance method. Because the

Essentially they correspond to the taxonomy units whose species having at

The test data is the same as those shown in Table 1.

calculation of the P or Edit distances between the query
and all sequences in the reference databases is prohibitively time-consuming, we combined these base methods
and compared their success rate and performance.
We first tested the success rate for discriminating
PTIGS sequences under various kmer sizes to determine
the optimal size for the kmer based method. As shown
in Table 2, vectors of frequencies of di-nucleotide were
found to have sufficient discrimination power (success
rate being 0.761) with a significant less processing time
(95.3 mS) comparing to those of other kmer sizes. Consequently, we use kmer size of 2 in the following study
and named the method Di-nucleotide Frequency Profile
(DNFP).
The taxon coverage of the test dataset is shown in
Table 1. Each species in the dataset contains at least two
individual sequences. Each of the sequences was used as
the query to search against the database with (labeled as
“include self” in Table 3) or without the query sequence
itself (labeled as “not include self” in Table 3) using the
corresponding methods. Previous studies have showed
that the prerequisite for meaningful DNA barcoding analysis is that the reference database must contain the
query sequences or sequences from the same species as
the query sequence. When using the database that is
“include self”, the query sequence will always pick up
itself from the reference database. The question is
whether or not it picks up non-self sequences at the
same time. If it only picks up its own sequence, it is considered a success. If it picks up non-self sequence at the
same time, it is considered a failure. For the database that
is “not include self”, it contains other sequences from the
same species but not the query sequence itself. When
using this database, if the nearest neighbors only contain
sequences from the same species, the identification is
considered a success, otherwise it is considered a failure.
To identify the best methods for discriminating PTIGS
sequences, we construct eight different methods based
on the four base methods BLAST (B), P distance
method (P), Edit distance method (E) and DNFP
method (D), which are B, B+P, B+E, D, D+P, D+E, B+P
+E and D+P+E respectively. Each query sequence was

Ratio indicates the number of correctly identified/total number of tests. The performance shows the average time in second taken to complete a query. The base
methods are B: BLAST; P: P Distance; E: Edit Distance; D: DNFP. “Included” means that the query sequences are included in the reference database, while
“excluded” means that the query sequences are not included in the database when performing the analyses.

compared to each sequence (target) in the reference
database to obtain the corresponding BLAST distance
(represented by similarity e-value or score), P distance,
Edit distance or DNFP distance (represented by the
pearson correlation between the kmer frequency vectors
of the query sequence and target sequence. The target
sequence(s) that has the smallest distance (i.e. “nearest
neighbor”) was considered the hit. “B+P” means that if
the query sequences cannot be successfully identified
using B method, it will be subjected to P method for
further identification. The meanings for other methods
are similar.
The success rate and performance for each method
combination against two different databases are shown
in Table 3. We found that the discrimination success
rate follows E > DNFP > P > B. In terms of speed, it follows that DNFP > B > P > E, from the fastest to the
slowest. The DNFP method is the fastest and has an
identification success rate close to the highest rate
(~80%), which is achieved when the E method was used.
The best method exceeds the poorest method (B) by a
margin of ~20% in terms of success rate. The slowest
method on the other hand, which involves E method, is
about 20 times slower than the fastest method (DNFP).
To demonstrate the usefulness of this web server and
its identification methods, we use a query sequence with
accession number EF590731 (Polytrichum juniperinum;
taxid 129213) as an example. Using Blast search method,
three sequences (sFigure 1 and 2) were found to have
the smallest e-value, they are GQ248374 (taxid: 129213),
EF590730 (Polytrichum commune; taxid: 3213) and
EF590731 (taxid: 129213). The Blast results are shown
in Table 4. The query sequence was then predicted to
belong to species P. juniperinum (taxid: 129213) or P.
commune (taxid: 3213). This result is considered unsuccessful. However, using Blast+P distance method, the
distances between the query sequence and the three

sequences (available from Additional File 3) with the
best e-value scores are shown in Table 5. As shown, the
query sequence was successfully identified to belong to
P. juniperinum. The query sequence, the three best
match sequences, the multiple alignments are shown in
supplementary Figure 1 and 2 respectively. A quick
tutorial is also available on the “identify” web site using
this sequence as an example.
Application pages
Review the reference barcode sequence

This page provides a summary for the PTIGS region of
each species. Usually, there are many individual
sequences associated with a single species, and the consensus sequence is an ideal way to represent the “average” DNA barcode sequence of a species. The input is
the taxid from NCBI for a species. While there are many
taxonomy systems available, we use NCBI’s taxonomy
system in our web server because the primary species
identifier in NCBI’s system (i.e. taxid) is directly linked to
DNA sequences. We decided not to duplicate this taxonomy system and the user will have to go to NCBI’s taxonomy page (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy) to
find the taxid for the taxonomy groups of interest. After
the query has been submitted, this module will return all
sequences associated with this taxid as well as the reference sequence for the species under query. The taxid and
sequence accession numbers are linked to their records

query. Consequently, the nearest neighbor to the query
sequence from the backend will be identified and considered as the most likely identity of the input sequence.
The taxid or taxids, if there are multiple hits, will be
returned along with the time taken to complete the
query.
Check the performance for 8 different identification
methods for given operational taxonomy units

in GenBank which allows the users to obtain more
detailed information about the species and the sequences.
Retrieve different segments of the PTIGS locus

We defined the PTIGS locus as composed of the 5’
psbA region, the PTIGS core region, and the 3’ trnH
region. The sequences of the PTIGS core region should
be the region used for DNA barcoding. This page allows
the user to retrieve a particular region as well as the
entire locus region that include the 5’, core and 3’
regions. While the core region is needed for species
determination analysis, the 5’ and 3’ regions can be used
to annotate newly obtained PTIGS sequences (see
below). The input is similar to the view page, which
contains a single taxid. After specifying the regions of
interest, this module will return all sequences associated
with the query taxid for the corresponding region.
Annotate novel sequences based on Hidden Markov Model
(HMM)

As described above, the PTIGS locus consists of three
regions: the 5’ psbA, the PTIGS core, and the 3’ trnH
regions. This module allows the determination of these
three regions for unannotated PTIGS locus sequences
using HMM. Three input files are needed for this module. The first file should contain multiple alignments of
sequences from the psbA region. The second file should
contain multiple alignments of sequences of the trnH
region. The third file contains the sequences to be annotated. The user will have to provide the 5’ and 3’
sequences that are needed to build the model. It is
recommended that the length of the aligned sequence
fragments should be between 20-30 bp and the total
number of sequence fragments should be >10, in order
to build the HMM. The backend annotation engine will
return the sequences with the three regions determined.
Species identification based on a PTIGS sequence

This page provides the interface for our species identification engine which consists of the eight methods
described above. Only one sequence is accepted at this
time for species determination. After selecting the
method of interest, the sequence will be compared to
the backend reference database using the specified
method. We use “nearest neighbor” as the criterion for
species inference because this has been found to be the
most reliable. The nearest neighbor is the sequence(s) in
the database that has or have the smallest BLAST distance, P distance, Edit distance or DNFP distance to the

As described in the algorithm section, eight different
methods have been developed. These methods were first
applied to a comprehensive and heterogeneous dataset
(Table 1). Subsequently, they were applied to datasets
containing sequences from various taxonomy groups
including kingdom, phylum, class, order, and family.
The rationale behind this is that it would be very valuable for the biologists who work on a particular group
of plants to know if the PTIGS core region is a good
DNA barcoding marker for the taxonomy group they
are studying. One can simply select the group of interest
from the pull down list and review the success ratio and
performance of the eight different methods for the
group of interest. However, we realize that particular
taxonomy group of interest might not be found in the
list. This is usually because no sequences are available
for this group when the data were compiled. It should
be noted that the analyses were carried out only on species that has at least two sequences because for species
having only one sequence, the “not include self” analysis
cannot be performed, and consequently, the comparison
between the “include self” and “not include self” analyses
is not applicable.

Discussion
So far, two core barcodes and two supplemental barcodes have been proposed for DNA barcoding of plant
species. To optimize the usage of these barcodes, each
barcode and the relevant methods have to have been
first studied in-depth. The lack of computational tools
that facilitate the retrieval and annotation of PTIGS
sequences, and that maximize PTIGS-based species
determination has hindered its use as a supplemental
DNA barcode. In this study, we have developed a web
server system that tackled these problems. Particularly,
we have constructed several hybrid methods that would
increase the species discrimination rate and also have
acceptable performance.
We construct the eight methods for the following reasons. Calculating BLAST distance requires local alignment. Its calculation only uses the nucleotides within the
locally aligned regions. In contrast, calculating both P and
Edit distances require global alignment. P distance is calculated using only nucleotides within the globally aligned
regions. On the other hand, the calculation of Edit distance uses all nucleotides between the two sequences.

Liu et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2011, 12(Suppl 13):S4
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/S13/S4

Consequently, among the alignment-based method, the
Edit distance method utilizes all available sequence variation information and should have the highest discrimination power. However, the cost for increased resolution is
the rapid degradation of performance. We combined the
base methods to form B+P, B+E and B+P+E so that fast
methods can be applied first and the queries that can not
be successfully identified can then be subjected to more
sensitive but slower methods. The alignment-free method
DNFP is most accurate and fastest (Table 3). However,
totally unrelated sequences might have similar DNFP. We
combined D+P, D+E and D+P+E to further resolve the
queries that cannot be resolved by DNFP method alone.
We include all eight methods in the web server for the
following considerations. In a typical scenario, the user can
employ the DNFP method first for quick species identification. He can further drill down with more sensitive methods if the query fails to be assigned to a single species. In
addition, the alignment-based methods can be used to validate the results obtained from the DNFP method.
The methods developed here have significantly
increased the success rate of PTIGS-based species identification when using the BLAST method. These methods
can be easily extended to other DNA barcodes. However,
it should be emphasized that the improvement of methods will not be able to solve many problems inherent to
DNA barcoding technologies. For example, computational methods can differentiate species for a given marker only if there are variations in the marker sequences
among different species. In addition, species determination is only useful when the query sequences exist in the
reference database. When the query sequence is not in
the reference database, the identification can be rather
unreliable. Last, these methods would be useless in the
cases that the voucher samples are wrongly-identified, or
the sequence annotations from public databases are
incorrect, which are known to be far too common.

Conclusions
In the current study, we have compared eight different
methods for PTIGS-based DNA barcoding analyses. We
have also developed tools that would facilitate the retrieval
and annotation of PTIGS sequences. All these tools have
been integrated into a web server. To our knowledge, this
web server represents the very first that supports PTIGSbased DNA barcoding analyses. It would strongly promote
the PTIGS-based DNA barcoding applications.
