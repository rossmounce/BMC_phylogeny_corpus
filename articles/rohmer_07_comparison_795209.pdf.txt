events associated with the emergence of human pathogenic strains

small indels took place in the human pathogenic strains during and after differentiation from the
nonpathogenic strain, resulting in gene inactivation.
Conclusion: The chronology of events suggests a substantial role for genetic drift in the formation
of pseudogenes in Francisella genomes. Mutations that occurred early in the evolution, however,
might have been fixed in the population either because of evolutionary bottlenecks or because they
were pathoadaptive (beneficial in the context of infection). Because the structure of Francisella
genomes is similar to that of the genomes of other emerging or highly pathogenic bacteria, this
evolutionary scenario may be shared by pathogens from other species.

Background

The genomes of bacterial pathogens are constantly evolving
through various processes. The acquisition of genes that promote virulence by lateral transfer is a common property of
pathogens [1,2]. The acquisition of additional virulence factors or pathogenicity islands can alter a pathogen's virulence
or host range, or both. For example, the diseases caused by
pathogenic Escherichia coli strains can take very diverse
forms, depending on the virulence factors encoded in the
locus of enterocyte effacement present in their genomes [3].
In addition to gain of function by gene acquisition, loss of
function has also been postulated to play a role in evolution
toward greater pathogenicity and host adaptation. Indeed,
highly pathogenic strains tend to harbor numerous pseudogenes, whereas related strains that are mildly pathogenic do
not. Comparison of Burkholderia and Bordetella genomes
suggests that loss of function contributes to host adaptation
[4,5]. In practice, few occurrences of fixed loss of function
have been demonstrated to be beneficial for virulence [6,7]. It
is therefore probable that many of the pseudogenes are
merely the result of lack of selection for functions that are not
needed in the host environment or of evolutionary bottlenecks [8-11].
One mechanism that promotes accelerated gene loss in pathogens may be the insertion of insertion sequences (IS elements). Analyses of genomes of some virulent strains have
revealed numerous IS elements and rearrangements. In
many genome comparisons with free-living or less virulent
strains, a correlation between IS elements, pseudogenes, and
genomic rearrangements has been observed. In Shigella
flexneri for instance, IS elements have disrupted one-third of
all genes annotated as pseudogenes [12]. Based on this observation and other comparisons [4,12-16], it has been proposed
that the proliferation of IS elements is the cause of a large
number of pseudogenes and genomic rearrangements in
emerging or highly virulent pathogens. Given the fact that
many highly virulent and emerging pathogens share these
genomic features [4,12-16], it is important to understand and
establish the relationship (if any) between gene acquisition,
IS elements, pseudogenes, and genomic rearrangements.
In order to examine in detail the genetic determinants and the
evolutionary processes involved in the emergence of Fran-

cisella human pathogenic strains, we compared the genomes
for human pathogenic strains with the genome of a strain that
is not pathogenic to humans, namely Francisella tularensis
subspecies novicida U112. The facultative intracellular pathogen Francisella tularensis causes the zoonotic disease
tularemia in a wide range of animals. Four subspecies of this
Gram-negative organism are recognized: holarctica, tularensis, novicida, and mediasiatica. Subspecies tularensis is
extremely infectious in humans; as few as ten colony-forming
units can cause a successful infection that can be lethal if it is
not treated. Subspecies holarctica causes a milder disease,
which is also known as tularemia [17]. The subspecies novicida diverged from an ancestor common to the subspecies
tularensis and holarctica [18]. Subspecies novicida is not
infectious in humans but it causes a disease in mice that is
very similar to tularemia, and it can replicate within human
macrophages in vitro [19]. A few cases of human infection
with subspecies novicida have also been reported in immunodeficient patients [20,21]. Similar virulence strategies are
used by the various subspecies [22,23], although subspeciesspecific factors must determine differences in host range and
infectivity.
The genomes of holarctica and tularensis strains both exhibit
properties similar to those of other highly virulent pathogens
[16,24,25]: high IS element content, numerous genomic rearrangements, and a high number of pseudogenes. A two-way
comparison between a holarctica and a tularensis strain
revealed a strikingly different genome organization between
them, mediated by ISFtu1 and ISFtu2 [16]. Since both strains
are pathogenic to humans, this comparison could not be used
to investigate the factors that enable these strains to infect
humans. Such an investigation became possible with the
genome sequence and annotation of F t novicida U112. In
contrast to the F tularensis strains already sequenced, F t
novicida U112 belongs to a subspecies that diverged from a
common ancestor before the divergence of the two human
pathogenic subspecies. Using the sequence of the genome of
U112, we looked in particular for acquired sequences and
genomic rearrangements that would have occurred before
divergence of the subspecies tularensis and holarctica. The
comparison of the genome of U112 with the genomes of F t
tularensis Schu S4 and F t holarctica LVS (live vaccine strain)
allowed us to determine the evolutionary processes that

We compared the newly sequenced genome of F t subspecies
novicida strain U112 with the published sequence of the
genomes of F t subspecies tularensis strain Schu S4 [25] and
that of F t subspecies holarctica strain LVS (Chain and coworkers, unpublished data). Some general properties and features of the three genomes are summarized in Table 1, in
which the extent of the similarity between the three subspecies is apparent. The genome of U112 is 17 kilobases (kb)
larger than the Schu S4 genome and 14 kb larger than the
genome of LVS. Few strain-specific regions were detected in
this three-way comparison: the genome of U112 carries about
240 kb of sequences not found in the two other strains; the
genome of Schu S4 carries 17.3 kb of strain-specific regions;
and the genome of LVS does not contain any specific regions.
The origin of replication of the U112 chromosome (around
position 1) was predicted according to one of the switching
points of the GC skew and by searching for DnaA-binding

Although no official genomic criteria exists to classify strains
into species, Konstantinidis and coworkers [31] found that
almost all 70 strains in their study set that reside in the same
species exhibited greater than 94% average nucleotide identity (ANI). They also showed that the classification based on
ANI correlates with classifications performed with 16S RNA
sequences, DNA-DNA re-association, and mutation rate. In
comparison, the few sequences of the other Francisella species available in Genbank, namely Francisella philomiragia,
exhibit an ANI of 91.66% with the genome of U112. The ANI
corroborates the proposition that novicida arose by diverging
from an ancestor common to the subspecies tularensis and
holarctica, and that the subspecies tularensis and holarctica
subsequently diverged from a common ancestor [31,32].
Based on the average level of nucleotide identity between the
three genomes, it is possible to estimate the rate of substitution in the genomes of holarctica and tularensis after their
divergence. The genomes of holarctica strains are estimated
to have evolved at an average rate of 0.55 base pairs (bp)/100
bp from the common ancestor, whereas the genome of Schu
S4 diverged at the lower rate of 0.25 bp/100 bp.

sequences. It is consistent with the predicted origin of replication of the chromosomes of Schu S4 and LVS, suggesting a
common genome backbone for the three subspecies. The estimated nucleotide sequence identity is 97.8% between the
sequences common to the U112 and the LVS genomes, 98.1%
between the sequences common to U112 and Schu S4, and
99.2% between the sequence common to Schu S4 and LVS.
The proposition based on physiologic experiments and DNADNA re-association [20] that novicida may be classified as a
subspecies of tularensis is supported by the nucleotide identity between genomes.

potentially contributed to the ability of tularensis and holarctica strains to infect humans. In addition, it shed some light
on the relationships between pseudogenes, IS elements, and
genomic rearrangements. The annotation of the strain U112
genome also provides a foundation for systematic genomescale studies of Francisella virulence and related processes
using a wild-type organism that does not require high-level
laboratory containment. Major attributes of F tularensis virulence have already been uncovered using the strain U112
[26-30], in advance of confirmation using human virulent
bacteria.

Genome reorganization occurred in the human pathogenic F
tularensis ancestral strain during or after differentiation from the
nonpathogenic strain
A recent study using paired-end sequencing [24] indicated
that the organization of the genomes of holarctica strains and
tularensis strains is not conserved. However, the organization was highly similar for the genomes of the 67 holarctica
strains analyzed. Similarly, the genome of holarctica strain
OSU18 is collinear with the genome of the holarctica strain
LVS, but it is organized differently than the genome of Schu
S4 [16]. These findings extend the phylogenetic and molecular evidence that the strains are mostly clonal in the subspecies holarctica and that their genome is relatively stable
[18,32-34]. The subspecies tularensis can be divided into two
distinct groups (type AI and AII) [18,35]. According to amplified fragment length polymorphism and restriction fragment
length polymorphism analyses, genomes in the subspecies
tularensis are organized differently but are similar within
groups [33,34]. Hence, the genome of LVS is representative of
all genomes in the subspecies holarctica, whereas the genome
of Schu S4 represents genomes in the type AI group.
Sequence alignment of the U112 and Schu S4 genomes reveals
59 chromosomal segments with the same gene content and
gene order in both organisms, but arranged differently
throughout both genomes (Figure 1). Chromosomal segments
with the same gene content and gene order in two bacterial
genomes are hereafter termed 'syntenic regions'. The discrepancy in the order of the chromosomal segments between the
two genomes suggests that regions have been moved, in one
genome or the other. Hence, there are a total of 118 genomic
breakpoints when comparing the two genomes. Similarly, 59
syntenic regions are arranged differently when comparing the
genomes of U112 and LVS, and 51 are arranged differently
between the genomes of Schu S4 and LVS (Figure 1), which is
the same amount as found when comparing Schu S4 and
OSU18 genomes [16]. Twenty-eight out of the 59 syntenic
blocks (47%) are nearly identical in the genomes of Schu S4
and LVS relative to the genome of U112. However, the order
in which the blocks are arranged differs greatly. This suggests
that these syntenic blocks formed before differentiation
between both human pathogenic subspecies, but moved independently later in one or both genomes. The rest of the syntenic blocks in LVS and Schu S4, in comparison with U112,

In addition to this core gene set, the genomes of LVS and Schu
S4 contain 41 genes whose sequences are absent from the
genome of U112, and thus may play an important role in the
virulence of holarctica and tularensis for humans. Thirteen
are single genes found within sequences common to the three
subspecies, and the remaining 28 are distributed in specific
regions containing two to six genes (Table 2). Even a small
number of acquired genes can cause specific differences in
pathogenicity [36]. It is interesting that U112 is not virulent
for humans but is nonetheless able to colonize human macrophages in vitro. This indicates that the strain encodes virulence factors that are important for the infection of human
macrophages but that it lacks specific factors that make
human infection possible for the holarctica and tularensis
strains. Hence, it is possible that some of the 41 genes that are
specific to human pathogenic strains but are lacking in U112
could confer the ability to infect humans. The genome of Schu
S4 contains nine additional protein encoding genes and two
pseudogenes (Table 3) that are absent from the other
genomes, which reduces the list of known tularensis specific
genes [37,38]. An 11.1 kb region (FTT1066-FTT1073) has
been shown to be present in all the strains of the subspecies
tularensis and was named RD8 [37]. It is possible that some
of these specific genes contribute to the greater virulence of
the tularensis strains compared with the holarctica strains.
In addition to specific genes, the genome of Schu S4 contains
20 duplicated genes and the genome of LVS has 34 duplicated
genes, found as single copies in the genome of U112. Because

deposited research

In summary, comparative analysis using the genome of U112
revealed that the complex evolutionary scenario of the three
F tularensis subspecies involves the transposition of ISFtu1
(tularensis and holarctica) and ISFtu2 (novicida, tularensis,
and holarctica), accompanied by replication of these ele-

Human pathogenic strains contain genes that are absent from the
nonpathogenic strain U112

reports

These findings strongly support the proposition that genomic
rearrangements occurred in the genomes of the tularensis
and holarctica strains by homologous recombination at
ISFtu1 and ISFtu2 elements [16]. This proposition is also supported by the fact that 82% of breakpoints of LVS-Schu S4
syntenic blocks are bordered by an IS element within 100 bp
(Figure 1). Similarly, 60% of the breakpoints in LVS-U112 and
Schu S4-U112 syntenic blocks are bordered by IS elements in
the genome of the human pathogenic subspecies (Figure 1).
This lower incidence may be due to transposition of IS elements subsequent to the initial rearrangement. IS elements
appear to play a prominent role in rearrangement events, further corroborating that these events took place in the ancestor
of holarctica and tularensis. Indeed, 88% of the Schu S4U112 syntenic blocks are bordered by an IS element at one
extremity or both in the genome of Schu S4. On the other
hand, the location of IS elements in the genome of U112
exhibits association with breakpoints for merely four ISFtu2
elements. This suggests that the IS elements did not play a
prominent role in the evolution of the strains that are not
pathogenic to humans.

In the genome of U112, 1,731 protein-coding genes, 14 pseudogenes, and seven disrupted genes encoding an IS element
transposase were identified. The coding regions (1,751,817
bp) represent 91.72% of the entire genome. Thirty-eight tRNA
genes were identified, representing 30 anticodons encoding
the 20 amino acids as well as three operons encoding the 5S,
16S, and 23S ribosomal RNAs and tRNAs for alanine and isoleucine. The same RNA genes and operons are found in the
genomes of tularensis and holarctica. Overall, 1,813 distinct
genes (excluding IS element genes and 33 hypothetical genes
that we believe are noncoding) were found in at least one of
the three genomes. Out of these 1,813 genes, a total of 1,572
gene sequences (functional or disrupted) are common to the
three genomes. Hence, the core gene set may represent about
86.4% of all distinct genes identified in the three genomes
(Additional data file 1).

reviews

Six types of IS elements were identified in the three genomes.
Five of them are present in the three genomes at least in a
remnant form, whereas one, ISFtu5, is only present in the
subspecies holarctica and tularensis. As shown in Table 1, the
number of each IS element varies greatly in the three strains.
The difference in numbers of ISFtu1 and ISFtu2 elements is
particularly large. It suggests that ISFtu1 has transposed and
proliferated in the genomes of the subspecies tularensis and
holarctica, or in the genome of their common ancestor.
ISFtu2 exhibits more proliferation in the holarctica genome.
ISFtu1 appears to have been replicated essentially in the
ancestor of holarctica and tularensis strains becuase 46 out
of 53 elements are bordered by the same sequences in both
genomes. Nine ISFtu1 elements exhibit the same bordering
regions on both sides in the two subspecies genomes. However, 37 other ISFtu1 elements share only one side with an
element in the other genome, indicating rearrangements specific to each subspecies. About 13 ISFtu2 elements may have
transposed in the ancestral genome of tularensis and holarctica, as indicated by common bordering sequences, but have
undergone subsequent rearrangements because ten ISFtu2
elements have only one common side.

they are identical copies, the duplicated genes could be
responsible for a novel gene expression pattern and could
therefore represent a gain of function for the human pathogenic strains.

Human pathogenic strains have undergone substantial loss of
function, but not the non-pathogenic strain
Fourteen pseudogenes have been identified in U112 (Additional data file 1). In contrast, the original annotation of Schu
S4 listed 201 pseudogenes [25]. Using the genome of U112 as
a reference, 53 additional pseudogenes were predicted in the

genome of Schu S4 (Additional data file 1) following a procedure described in Materials and methods (see below), most of
which were annotated as multiple open reading frames
(ORFs) in the published genome. Because the strain LVS was
artificially attenuated, it is expected to contain mutations that
are not found in any other holarctica genome. Indeed, 11
pseudogene-causing mutations were found to be specific to
the LVS genome [39]. We ignored these 11 pseudogenes for
the following comparative analysis, because they do not represent a loss of function in the holarctica subspecies as a
whole.

This example illustrates the proposed model of evolution of
Francisella human pathogenic strains: initial inactivation of
a gene in the ancestor of the subspecies tularensis and holarctica (potentially pathoadaptive) and further gene inactivation
in regions no longer subjected to selective pressure before
and after subspeciation.

interactions

When directly compared with the genome of U112, most pseudogenes in the genomes of Schu S4 and LVS appear to result
from small indels (1 or 2 bp) or nonsense mutations. In tularensis and holarctica genomes, genes within 1 kb from a
genomic breakpoint are twice as likely to be inactivated as
were genes in other genomic locations (Figure 2a). The proportion of genes that are within 1 kb from a genomic breakpoint and are inactivated is 28.5% in the genome of Schu S4
(57 out of 200), whereas the global proportion of inactivated
genes is 12.6%. Similarly, 24.9% of genes within 1 kb from
genomic breakpoints are inactivated in the genome of LVS,

reports

A total of 160 genes are inactivated in the genomes of both
subspecies holarctica and tularensis. Upon alignment of
their sequences, 53% of pseudogenes common to LVS and
Schu S4 exhibit at least one common mutation that may have
led to their inactivation, whereas 32% of the pseudogenes
common to both subspecies share no common variations. The
sequence of the remaining 15% is too divergent to determine
a potential common inactivating mutation (Additional data
file 1). This indicates that at least 53% have arisen in the
genome of the human pathogenic ancestor. These 82 pseudogenes bearing common mutations are more likely to be
located directly at breakpoints than the pseudogenes not
sharing any common mutation (Figure 2b). In addition, the
IS insertion is the only inactivating common mutation found
in 19 out the 82 pseudogenes from the ancestral strain. This
suggests that IS insertions or subsequent sequence rearrangements contributed to at least 22% of the earliest gene
inactivations that took place in the emerging human pathogenic strain.

In agreement with this conjecture, predicted operons located
at breakpoints are more likely to contain more than one pseudogene, in Schu S4 by 4-fold and in LVS by 1.4-fold. An
additional argument in favor of the inactivation of some genes
by genetic drift is the uneven distribution of pseudogenes
across functional categories (Figure 2c). Pseudogenes and
absent genes of the holarctica and tularensis genomes have
been assigned to functional categories based on the annotation of their functional counterpart in the genome of U112.
For example, 41.2% of the genes predicted to be involved in
amino acid biosynthesis in the genome of novicida are inactivated in the genome of one or both of the other subspecies.
Similarly, 43.1% of the genes predicted to encode transporters
are inactivated in the genomes of holarctica and tularensis.
Remarkably, the distribution in functional categories is the
same for genes inactivated in one genome and those inactivated in both. Likewise, it was previously observed in the
genomes of Salmonella typhi and S paratyphi that the pseudogenes were different but appeared to belong to the same
pathways and operons [11]. The over-representation of pseudogenes in certain functional categories suggests a loss of
function associated with specific pathways, resulting in the
decay of multiple genes in these categories [40]. Following
the disruption of a biologic process by the inactivation of one
gene, other genes involved in this process are no longer subjected to selective pressure.

strains and a strain nonpathogenic to humans provides

whereas the global proportion of inactivated genes is 16.3%.
Figure 2a shows that, to a lesser extent, the genes within 3 kb
from a breakpoint are also more likely to be inactivated than
are the genes in the rest of the genome. In Schu S4, 15.4% of
genes between 1 and 2 kb from a breakpoint are inactivated
and 17.1% are between 2 and 3 kb. Similarly in LVS 18.8% of
the genes between 1 and 2 kb from a breakpoint and 22.1%
between 2 and 3 kb are inactivated. It is unlikely that genomic
rearrangements could directly have caused mutations as far
as 3 kb from the breakpoints. It is more likely that the rearrangements disrupted the transcriptional unit to which these
genes belong. If these genes are no longer transcribed, then
their sequences are no longer subjected to selection and
evolve by neutral genetic drift, eventually causing the disruption of the ORF through mutation.

comment

When compared with the genome of U112, analysis of the
genome of LVS revealed 303 pseudogenes in addition to those
contained in IS elements (Additional data file 1). OK The
number of protein encoding genes in the genome of LVS and
the subspecies holarctica in general may therefore be about
1,400. The higher mutation rate observed in holarctica
genomes as compared with tularensis could explain the
greater number of pseudogenes. In addition, at least eight
genes present in novicida and holarctica were lost by the
strain Schu S4, and ten that were present in novicida and
tularensis were lost by LVS. A set of 160 genes were inactivated in both LVS and Schu S4. Taking into account gene
deletion and inactivation, U112 encodes 164 functions that
are no longer active in both holarctica and tularensis strains.
Similarly, 18 functions are specific to the strain Schu S4 and
potentially to the subspecies tularensis in general (Table 3).

medium (Rohmer and coworkers, unpublished data). In the
tularensis and holarctica strains the leucine, isoleucine, and
valine biosynthesis pathway is inactivated. Based on the
organization of the two regions depicted in Figure 3, we can
infer events that took place in leu and ilv loci. Two ISFtu1 elements are associated with the leu operon in both human pathogenic strains and have the same bordering sequences: the
same portions of leuA and the upstream sequence of leuB.
Hence, the insertion of two ISFtu1 elements has taken place
in the leu operon of the ancestor of the two strains and disrupted leuA and the upstream region of leuB. All sequences of
the leu operon are still present in the genome of LVS, but they
are scattered to three different locations, all associated with

ISFtu1 elements. In the genome of Schu S4, leuB, leuD, and
leuC have been deleted and one IS element sits in place of the
deletion (Figure 3). It seems therefore that the two ISFtu1 elements inserted in the genome of the ancestor underwent different recombination events in each strain. The ilv operon
contains distinct mutations in the genome of LVS and Schu
S4; in LVS ilvB (FTL_0913-FTL_0914) and ilvD (FTL_0911FTL_0912) are inactivated by a 100 bp deletion and a 350 bp
deletion, respectively, whereas in Schu S4 ilvC (FTT0643)
and ilvB (FTT0641) are inactivated because of a nonsense
mutation and a single nucleotide deletion, respectively. The
distinct origin of the inactivation of the ilv operon indicates
that mutations took place after divergence as well.

As described in the Introduction (above), virulence strategies
overlap in the three subspecies. Here, we provide a list of virulence factors complementary to those previously predicted

[16,25,41] using the U112 genome as a reference (Additional
data file 2). A variety of protein features are potentially indicative of a role in virulence, such as the presence of a protein
domain previously associated with a virulence function, the
presence of a eukaryotic domain, or homology to eukaryotic
proteins sufficiently high to suggest a role in the host cell [4244]. A total of 129 proteins in U112 revealed one or more of

(LVS). The ISFtu1 element that disrupted leuA and the ISFtu1 integrated upstream of leuB share the same bordering sequences in both genomes. The
inactivating mutation in leuB is the same in both genomes as well. Therefore, these events are believed to have taken place in the leu operon before
divergence into two subspecies. The other mutations in the regions of the leu operon and the ilv operon are of different origins in the two genomes,
indicating that these mutations took place after the subspeciation.

these features. Interestingly, only 80 of them were present
and functional in both of the other genomes (Additional data
file 2). This suggests that many of these 129 proteins are not
involved in virulence or are not essential for the virulence in
humans. It is still conceivable that these proteins confer a
capacity to infect hosts or to target functions that the subspecies holarctica and tularensis no longer utilize, or they may
even be detrimental to the bacterium in the human host.

U112. In addition, there are 20 duplicated genes in Schu S4
and 34 in LVS. Included in this set is the duplicated
pathogenicity island, of which there is only one copy in U112
[26]. The duplication of the Francisella pathogenicity island
may provide a higher level of expression of the virulence
genes it carries, as it is the case for the Shiga toxin genes in
Shigella dysenteriae 1 [47]. Potentially, greater expression of
these pathogenicity genes could play a role in virulence in
humans.

The ORF FTN_0921 in novicida U112 (FTT1043 in Schu S4)
is homologous to a Legionella macrophage infectivity potentiator. FTN_1151 (FTT1170) contains Sel1 eukaryotic
tetratrico peptide repeats and is homologous to EnhC and
EnhA of Coxiella burnetii, which promote entry of Coxiella
into host cells. These two proteins could contribute to entry of
the bacteria into the macrophage. FNU1336 (FTT1332) may
be a hemolysin. FTN_0403 (FTT0877c) is only homologous
to eukaryotic proteins and, in particular, to a family of membrane-bound proteins with which it shares a pair of repeats,
each spanning two transmembrane helices connected by a
loop. The PQ motif found on loop 2 was shown to be critical
for the localization of cystinosin to lysosomes [45].
FTN_0083 (FTT0243) may interact with the cytoskeleton of
the host cell because it contains an α-tubulin suppressor or
related RCC1 domain. FTN_0171 (FTT0195) has ankyrin
repeats, sometimes present in bacterial virulence factors.
Larsson and coworkers [25] pointed out that the genome of
Francisella tularensis does not encode any of the secretion
systems that are usually associated with pathogenicity (type
III and type IV). A protein homologous to toxin secretion ABC
transporters (FTN_1693) and HlyD-family secretion proteins
(FTN_0029, FTN_0718, and FTN_1276) may play a role in
the delivery of virulence factors. It has been shown that a
secretion system similar to type II and type IV systems is
responsible for the secretion of virulence factors in U112 [29].
TolC appears to play a role in virulence in U112 as well in holarctica strains [46]. Secretion through these systems first
requires protein translocation through the bacterial inner
membrane via an independent export system. A full and functional sec system was identified in the genome of U112 as well
as in the genomes of Schu S4 and LVS. This suggests that
some of the proteins that are exported outside the cell may
contain a signal peptide, promoting their translocation across
the inner membrane via the sec system. Hence, we suggest
that there may be proteins that interact with host factors that
are yet to be identified among the set of proteins with a predicted signal sequence.

Among the 41 genes found solely in the genome of the holarctica and tularensis subspecies, 24 have no predicted function
(Table 2). Some of the 41 genes could be linked to the pathogenicity of the human pathogenic strains. Six genes involved
in the biosynthesis of the O-antigen of lipopolysaccharide in
type A and type B strains have no counterparts in U112. The
U112 subspecies carries a different set of genes for this
function. This could explain the difference noted in the structure of the O-antigen of U112 as compared with those of tularensis strains [48]. The difference in the O-antigen part of the
lipopolysaccharide structure could contribute to the difference in host range observed between the three subspecies. In
addition to sequence-specific genes, five U112 pseudogenes
are functional in both holarctica and tularensis. It may be
that inactivation of these genes impairs the virulence of the
strain U112 in humans, but the functions they encode do not
suggest this possibility. Two of these genes encode nicotinamide ribonucleoside (NR) uptake permease family proteins
(FTT0707 and FTT1090), but four other genes found in the
U112 genome encode proteins of this family and some of their
counterparts have become pseudogenes in the genome of holarctica and tularensis strains. Hence, these genes may have
been inactivated because of functional redundancy.
FTT0666c (homologous to some methylpurine-DNA glycosylases), inactivated in U112, may be involved in DNA repair following DNA damage induced by stress. FTT1076 (hipA), a
protein that potentially is involved in persistence after exposure to antimicrobial products or other stressful conditions
[49], is also inactivated in U112. It is therefore possible that
U112 may be less resistant to human responses than the holarctica and tularensis strains. Finally, FTT1450c, wbtM on
the O-antigen gene cluster, encodes a dTDP-D-glucose 4,6dehydratase. Because some components of lipopolysaccharide are missing in U112, it is possible that FTT1450c in U112
has degenerated over time because of lack of selection. It
would be interesting to examine the state of these five genes
in the novicida strains isolated in humans [20,21,50].

We consider functions to be specific to the human pathogenic

novicida are inactivated. We have found 41 genes whose DNA

information

The three-way genomic comparison described in this study
illustrates the value of comparing closely related genomes of
a nonpathogenic strain and human pathogenic strains. It
allowed us to perform a detailed analysis of the events that
may have led to the emergence of Francisella human pathogenic strains. The emergence could have been initiated by the
gain or loss of function (pathoadaptivity) that took place in a
few bacteria, an event that enables them to colonize an environment de novo, or more successfully than before. This step
constitutes a first evolutionary bottleneck because only a
small number of bacteria undergo the genomic change, and

Conclusion

refereed research

Our data suggest that more than half of the pseudogenes in
the human pathogenic strains appeared relatively late in their
evolution, after the subspeciation. If pathoadaptive mutations occurred, then it is more likely that they took place
before the divergence of the pathogenic strains, rather than
twice, independently in each pathogenic subspecies. The 84
pseudogenes in the two human pathogenic strains that have
arisen in the genome of their common ancestor are listed in
Additional data file 1. Significantly, the gene pepO is part of
these early mutants in the human pathogenic strains. This
gene is active in U112, but a strain U112 in which pepO
(FTN_1186) is inactivated spreads more to systemic sites
[29]. Similarly, the system used to secrete pepO and other
proteins [29] was also altered in the ancestor of the human
pathogenic strains (FTN_0306 and FTN_0389). The distribution of the early pseudogenes across functional categories
is similar to the distribution of the entire set of pseudogenes
(data not shown). However, although eight independent
pathways of amino acid biosynthesis are inactivated in one or
both human pathogenic strains (24 genes), only one biosynthesis pathway is inactivated in the ancestral strain: the biosynthesis pathway for leucine, isoleucine, and valine. This
suggests that the biosynthesis of most amino acids is not
required in the current niche of tularensis and holarctica
subspecies, but also that only leucine/isoleucine/valine
biosynthesis may have played a role in preventing virulence in
the human niche. Three transcriptional regulators are inactivated in both genomes: two regulators of the LysR family, and
kdpD and kdpE, which form a two-component regulator.
Numerous genes encoding transporters are also inactivated.
Hence, it is apparent that the tularensis and holarctica subspecies have lost their ability to adapt to or exploit some conditions, and perhaps have undergone niche restriction.

deposited research

Eight additional genes involved in regulation are inactivated
in the genome of holarctica alone (Additional data file 1). Six
of these genes belong to the LysR transcriptional regulator
family. The regulators of the LysR family have diverse targets,
including virulence genes and genes that are involved in
response to a specific environment. The genome of holarctica
strains also exhibits a higher number of pseudogenes in the
functional category 'motility, attachment, and secretion
structure'. Although three genes encoding potential pilins are
inactivated in both subspecies, the holarctica genome underwent inactivation of four additional genes encoding pilins and
two predicted to encode membrane fusion proteins. Attachment and motility are key aspects of pathogenicity, and inactivation of these genes may lower the efficiency of infection of
humans by holarctica strains. In addition, six genes that are
potentially involved in DNA repair are solely inactivated in
holarctica (including one encoding a photolyase that repairs
mismatched pyrimidine dimers, and one that encodes the
protein mutT, which is involved in removing an oxidatively

Loss of function common to tularensis and holarctica provide clues
to possible pathoadptation and to the properties of the
environmental niches they occupy during their life cycle

damaged form of guanine). This could explain the higher rate
of mutation in holarctica strains than in tularensis strains,
and may indirectly be responsible for the inactivation of
genes that are important for the pathogenicity of holarctica
strains.

reviews

In addition to the sequence-specific functions, some functions (encoded by 20 genes) are specific to Schu S4 because
they are pseudogenes or absent in the genomes of U112 and
LVS. Table 3 lists these 20 genes. A predicted O-methyltransferase (FTT1766) is only functional in Schu S4, and could
influence the composition of the bacterial surface. FTT0939,
an adenosine deaminase, is only functional in type A strains.
This enzyme is predicted to be involved in purine salvage.
This could be important to consider for vaccine design,
because inactivation of the purine biosynthesis pathway of a
type A strain may not result in the significant reduction of fitness that has been observedin type B [51] and novicida strains
(data not shown).

comment

tem restriction enzyme that is apparently nonfunctional
(FTT1067); a DNA helicase, which is also nonfunctional
(FTT1070); and a predicted antirestriction protein
(FTT1071). The five other proteins have no predicted function. This region is bordered on each side by ISFtu1 elements.
Because it is specific to all type A strains and exhibits properties of genomic islands (low G+C content and proteins related
to mobile elements), the region may be a pathogenicity island
that contributes to the virulence of tularensis. FTT1580c, a
hypothetical protein, was detected in the region of difference
RD1 [37] as specific to the subspecies tularensis. Two hypothetical proteins, namely FTT1308c and FTT1791, were also
determined to be specific to Schu S4 in the three-way comparison. They were not detected in the regions of difference
obtained by Broekhuijsen and coworkers [37] and Svensson
and colleagues [38], and so it is possible that these genes are
not specific to tularensis strains or are not present in all tularensis strains. Alternatively, the differences are not detectable with the techniques used by the authors.

any mutation that was carried in this restricted set of bacteria
is conserved within the pathogenic population. Consequently,
IS transpositions and nucleotide substitution may have
caused gene decay as the result of genetic drift and evolutionary bottlenecks (such as small inocula during an infection).
The features of the holarctica and tularensis genomes are
consistent with those observed in other facultative or recent
obligate intracellular highly pathogenic bacteria. Consequently, our analysis could contribute to deciphering the evolutionary processes that take place in other facultative or
recent obligate intracellular, highly pathogenic bacteria.

Materials and methods
Genome sequencing and validation
Whole genome shotgun sequencing was used to sequence the
F tularensis subspecies novicida U112 [52] genome, as per
the standard protocols followed in the University of Washington Genome Center [53,54]. In all, 32,180 plasmid and 1,728
fosmid paired-end sequencing reads were attempted, which
provided 10.3× sequence coverage for the U112 genome
(average Q20 614 bases/read, failure rate 16.3%). The
genome was assembled using Phred/Phrap software tools
[55,56] and viewed in CONSED [57]. The assembly contained
213 contigs, with 98 contigs being more than 2 kb in size.
Genome finishing was initially attempted by carrying out
experiments designed by the Autofinish tool in CONSED
[58]. Manual finishing by an expert finisher followed four
reiterative rounds of Autofinish. The finished F tularensis
subspecies novicida U112 genome assembly contained 29,180
sequencing reads. Experimentally derived fingerprints from
fosmid clones were compared with the virtual sequencederived fragments from the finished genome using the
SeqTile software developed in-house (Gillett, unpublished
data). Correspondence between the experimentally and
sequence derived fingerprints was observed, validating the
final F tularensis subspecies novicida U112 genome assembly. The replication origin was determined using the software
Oriloc [59].

Genome-wide comparisons
The genome sequences of F tularensis subspecies holarctica
strain LVS and F tularensis subspecies tularensis Schu S4
used were those of the published annotation (NC_007880
and NC_006570, respectively). Genomic sequence comparisons were performed with the program Nucmer from the
package MUMmer [60] using a minimum cluster length of
650 bp. The software show-coords of the same package was
then used to infer the degree of similarity and to map the
genomic fragments of the query genome onto the reference
genome. Additional curation of the output of show-coords
was performed using custom Perl scripts. Fragments inferred
to be strain specific were searched against the genomes of
other strains using the algorithm megablast [61] to confirm
their specificity.

Identification of genes in Francisella genomes
Protein coding sequences in the genome of F tularensis subspecies novicida strain U112 were predicted using Glimmer
2.13 [62] and manually curated. The protein coding regions
for F tularensis subspecies holarctica strain LVS and F tularensis subspecies tularensis Schu S4 were those of the published annotation (NC_007880 and NC_006570,
respectively).

Identification and comparison of the three Francisella
genomes
We initially used the protein sequences to determine orthologous genes. Orthologous proteins in the three strains were
first determined by reciprocal best hit (RBH) using the blastp
algorithm [63,64]. When no orthologous gene was found in
one genome, the blastn algorithm was used to search for a
matching sequence in the genome in which it was missing,
and - when present - the sequence was associated with the
sequences of the orthologs in the other genomes. When the
orthologous protein sequences differed in length by more
than 30% (a threshold more conservative than the standard
[20%] determined by Lerat and coworkers [65,66]), the gene
encoding the shortest protein was designated a pseudogene,
which represented about 73% of all pseudogenes in the
genome of Schu S4. When the size differed by 10% to 30%, the
protein alignments were examined and the status of the gene
(functional or pseudogene) was assigned manually. Usually,
these cases matched pseudogenes with a frameshift leading to
a protein of similar size or a mutation close to the 5' extremity
(such as an IS element insertion), where the ORF predictor
would predict an ORF beginning at the next available start
codon.

Genome annotation
Gene descriptions and functional categories were manually
determined based on homologies to domains found in the
PFAM database [67], the Prosite database [68], and the cdd
database [69]; homologies to proteins of the nr database and
the TCDB database [70]; as well as by complementary
approaches such as the Gotcha method [71] and the Pathway
tools software [72]. A distinction was made between genes
encoding hypothetical proteins, for which no significant homology could be detected in any database except for nr, and
genes encoding proteins of unknown function, for which no
significant homology could be detected in any database
except for nr, but were shown to be expressed by U112 in rich
medium (data not shown). Transcriptional units were predicted using the operon finding software (ofs) version 1.2 [73]
and selecting all predictions with a final probability of 0.46 or
greater. The size of the operons varied from two to 29 genes
(encoding ribosomal proteins). tRNAs were determined with
tRNAscan-SE [74]. rRNA operons were determined by
searching the genome for conserved rRNA sequences using
the blastn algorithm [63]. The cellular location of encoded
proteins was predicted with PSORTB [75]. The presence of a
potential signal peptide necessary for secretion by the sec sys-
