Abstract
Background: Septins are cytoskeletal GTPase proteins first discovered in the fungus
Saccharomyces cerevisiae where they organize the septum and link nuclear division with cell division.
More recently septins have been found in animals where they are important in processes ranging
from actin and microtubule organization to embryonic patterning and where defects in septins have
been implicated in human disease. Previous studies suggested that many animal septins fell into
independent evolutionary groups, confounding cross-kingdom comparison.
Results: In the current work, we identified 162 septins from fungi, microsporidia and animals and
analyzed their phylogenetic relationships. There was support for five groups of septins with
orthology between kingdoms. Group 1 (which includes S. cerevisiae Cdc10p and human Sept9) and
Group 2 (which includes S. cerevisiae Cdc3p and human Sept7) contain sequences from fungi and
animals. Group 3 (which includes S. cerevisiae Cdc11p) and Group 4 (which includes S. cerevisiae
Cdc12p) contain sequences from fungi and microsporidia. Group 5 (which includes Aspergillus
nidulans AspE) contains sequences from filamentous fungi. We suggest a modified nomenclature
based on these phylogenetic relationships. Comparative sequence alignments revealed septin
derivatives of already known G1, G3 and G4 GTPase motifs, four new motifs from two to twelve
amino acids long and six conserved single amino acid positions. One of these new motifs is septinspecific and several are group specific.
Conclusion: Our studies provide an evolutionary history for this important family of proteins and
a framework and consistent nomenclature for comparison of septin orthologs across kingdoms.

Background
Septins were first identified in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae where they have been very well-characterized [1]. In S. cerevisiae five septins, Cdc3p, Cdc10p,
Cdc11p, Cdc12p and Shs1p, polymerize to form a ring at
the mother-bud neck where they are important for bud
site selection and cytokinesis. Two other yeast septins,
Spr3p and Spr28p, are expressed during sporulation [2,3].

Yeast septins have been shown to function as a scaffold
organizing the division site and coordinating nuclear and
cellular division. Septins have also been shown to act as a
barrier, preventing diffusion of RNA and proteins between
mother and daughter cells [1,4]. Though not as well-characterized as those in yeast, septins in other fungi also
appear to organize sites of cell division and new growth
[5]. Septins have been found in a variety of animal tissues.

In addition to acting as a diffusion barrier, animal septins
are implicated in vesicle trafficking, apoptosis and cell
movement [6]. In mammals septins appear to regulate
membrane and cytoskeleton organization and abnormal
septins have been linked with cancer and neurodegeneration [7-9].
Septins are P-loop GTPase proteins [10]. P-loop GTPases,
including kinesin, myosin and ras proteins share at least
five conserved motifs designated G1 to G5 within the
GTP-binding domain [11]. The G1 motif, defined by the
consensus element GxxxxGK [ST], forms a flexible loop
which interacts with the phosphate group of the nucleotide [10-12]. The G2 motif is conserved within individual
GTPase families, but not across the whole class [11]. The
G3 motif contains several hydrophobic residues followed
by DxxG [10-12]. This region binds Mg2+ and can interact
with β and γ phosphates of GTP [10,11,13]. The G4 motif,
NKxD, is important for GTP binding specificity [10,14].
The G5 motif is found in some, but not all, members of
the P-loop GTPase class [11].
Septins clearly contain the G1, G3 and G4 motifs [15]
(Figure 1). Septins purified from Drosophila, Xenopus and
Saccharomyces have been shown to bind or hydrolyze GTP
though the biological significance of these activities and
the specific functions of these motifs are not yet clear [1618]. N-terminal to the GTPase domain, septins contain a
polybasic region that has been shown to bind phosphoinositides [19,20]. C-terminal to the GTPase domain, a 53

Typical septin structure
Typical septin structure. Septin sequences range from
about three hundred to six hundred amino acids. Septins
contain the conserved GTP_CDC binding domain with three
motifs: G1, GxxxxGK [ST] (amino acids 126–135 in S. cerevisiae Cdc3p); G3, DxxG (amino acids 204–209 in S. cerevisiae
Cdc3p); and G4, xKxD (amino acids 280–289 in S. cerevisiae
Cdc3p). The previously described polybasic region (amino
acids 110–120 in S. cerevisiae Cdc3p; [19, 21]) is shown as a
black box and the previously described "septin unique element" (amino acids 360–413 in S. cerevisiae Cdc3p [21]); is
shown as a grey box. S1-S4 mark positions of new septin
motifs (Table 2b; amino acid 237–242, 247–259, 261–268,
364–365 in S. cerevisiae Cdc3p) and lines below diagram show
conserved single amino acid positions (Table 2c; amino acids
117, 295, 300, 339, 360, 396 in S. cerevisiae Cdc3p). Many
septins also have a predicted coiled-coil domain at the C-terminus (amino acids 476–507 in S. cerevisiae Cdc3p; [21]).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/103

amino acid septin element conserved among many
septins has been previously identified [21]. Most septins
also contain a C-terminal extension predicted to form
coiled-coils and shown to be needed for interactions
between certain septins [19,22,23].
Previously fungal septins were placed into groups based
on phylogenetic analysis [24] and mammalian septins
were placed into groups based on primary sequence similarity [6]. Kinoshita [25] used phylogenetic analysis of
two fungal yeast species and three animal species to conclude that orthologous relationships existed within fungal
or animal septins, but not between fungal and animal
septins making it impossible to compare model fungi and
less tractable animals [25]. Recent genome projects provide an excellent opportunity to better understand the
evolutionary relationships of septins. Here we identify
162 septins from 36 fungi, microsporidia and animals.
Based on phylogenetic analysis we place the septins into
five groups, two of which clearly contain orthologous fungal and animal septins. We also present three modified
GTPase motifs, four new motifs and six individual amino
acid positions which have been conserved among fungal,
microsporidial and animal septins. Our results suggest
that it should be possible to apply lessons learned from a
subset of septins in model organisms to septins from
mammals.

Results
Database searches identified 166 septin-related sequences
We used the Cdc3p sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
one of the best-studied septins, to query GenBank with
the PSI-BLAST program and detected 876 sequences.
From the PSI-BLAST list we identified 166 unique potential septin sequences based on an e-value lower than e-3,
the presence of the G1, G3 and G4 GTPase motifs and
other sequence similarities (Table 1). In our designation,
the first three letters represent the species from which the
sequence came (e.g. Sce represents Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Three septin sequences appeared to be truncated and
were eliminated from further consideration (AbiSep,
DyaSep2, and ZroCDC). We individually checked each of
the remaining 163 potential septin sequences for the presence of the GTP_CDC domain [26].

Three of the 163 sequences were predicted to have only
half of the GTP_CDC consensus domain and were designated "septin-like" (Gla, GzeHyp7 and NcrHyp7) (Table
1). In addition to septin sequences, our PSI-BLAST search
with the Cdc3p query returned myosins and kinesins. A
phylogenetic tree was built with representative septins,
myosins, kinesins and ras GTPase family proteins to determine the relationship of the septin-like sequences to other
GTPases. The three septin-like sequences did not group
with any of the other GTPase superfamilies examined

(data not shown). A BLAST search with the septin-like
sequences did not give significant hits from any known
protein families. This suggested that the septin-like
sequences represent either ancient or diverged septins, or
that they belong to an unknown protein family that shares
some motifs with septins. The septin-like sequence found
in Giardia lamblia is potentially illuminating for the evolution of this protein family because of Giardia's position as
a basal eukaryote.

taining microsporidial septins EcuSep1 and EcuSep2 and
fungal septin CalSpr3 had 0.98 credibility suggesting that
the ancestral septin which gave rise to Group 4 also arose
before the fungal/microsporidial split. Group 5, the smallest group, contained septins solely from filamentous
fungi. The lack of orthologs from budding or fission yeast
suggests that Group 5 septins either arose early in fungal
evolution and were lost from yeasts or arose relatively late
in fungal evolution.

The remaining 160 potential septin sequences grouped
within a clade clearly separated from the other GTPase
clades (data not shown). We designated these 160
sequences septins. After our PSI-BLAST search we became
aware of two additional septins, human Sept 13
(HsaSept13) and Ustilago maydis Cdc10 (UmaCdc10),
through reading of the literature [27,28]. We included
these sequences for a total of 162 septins. Consistent with
previous reports, we found septins in animals and fungi,
but not in plants. Three septins were also found in the
microsporidium Encephalitozoon cuniculi. We used a
septin from E. cuniculi (EcuSepI, GenBank:gi|19075150)
to query GenBank with PSI-BLAST a second time, and did
not find any new potential septins.

Fungal septins
Ascomycetes with completed genome sequences had five
to eight septins while basidiomycetes had four or five
(Table 1). All fungi had single Group 1 and Group 2
septins. In contrast, at least some fungi had multiple
Group 3, Group 4 and Group 5 septins. In particular,
ascomycetous yeasts had three Group 3 septin paralogs.
U. maydis and Eremothecium gossypii are the only two filamentous fungi in our study that lacked a Group 5 septin.

Phylogenetic Analysis
Bayesian analysis of all septins
To investigate the evolutionary history of the septin gene
family, we used the MrBayes program [29] to construct a
phylogenetic tree for all 162 septins, rooting the tree with
the S. cerevisiae myosin Myo2p. The septins could be
grouped into five major clades (Figure 2). Two clades contained fungal and animal septins (Groups 1 and 2) (Figure 3 and Figure 4); two clades contained fungal and
microsporidial septins (Groups 3 and 4); one clade contained only fungal septins (Group 5) (Figure 5). Group 1
consisted of two subgroups, 1A and 1B. Subgroup 1A further partitioned into one fungal clade and one animal
clade supported by 0.96 credibility. The animal septins in
Group 1A were closer to fungal Cdc10-type septins than to
other animal septins. Group1A provides the strongest evidence for orthologous relationships between fungal and
animal septins, suggesting the ancestral septin that gave
rise to members of Group 1A originated before the fungal/
animal split. Orthologous relationships between fungal
septins in Group 2A and animal septins in Group 2B were
supported with 0.78 credibility. Group 3 contained fungal
and microsporidial septins. Though the credibility for
Group 3 was only 0.55, all sequences except SpoSpn5, fell
within a large clade with 0.85 credibility suggesting that
the ancestral septin which gave rise to Group 3 arose
before the fungal/microsporidial split. Group 4 also contained fungal and microsporidial septins. Though it had a
moderate credibility score of 0.76, sequences from Group
4 consistently fell within this clade. The small clade con-

Animal septins
In the animals with completed genomes, nematodes had
two or three septins, insects had four or five, fish had six
and mammals had twelve or thirteen septins (Table 1). All
animal septins fell within Groups 1 or 2, with Group 2B
often showing the most expansion. The nematode
Caenorhabditis elegans contained one septin from Group
1B and one from Group 2B. C. briggsae also had a single
Group1B septin, but contained two Group 2B septins. The
insect Anopheles gambiae contained a single Group 1B septin and three Group 2B septins, while Drosophila melanogaster had an additional Group 1B septin. The zebrafish
Danio rerio contained a septin from Group 1A along with
two septins from Group 1B and three from Group 2B. The
mammals Mus musculus and Rattus norvegicus contained
three Group 1A septins and five Group 2B septins. Homo
sapiens contained three Group 1A septins and six Group
2B septins. M. musculus and R. norvegicus had five Group
1B septins while H. sapiens had four Group1B septins.
Martinez and Ware previously divided mammalian
septins into groups designated I-IV [6,30,31]; those
groups fell within our Groups 1A, 1B and 2B as indicated
in Figure 2.
Microsporidial septins
E. cuniculi, the single microsporidium with a completed
genome included in our study, had three septins. E.
cuniculi contained a single Group 3 sequence and two
Group 4 sequences. In contrast to all fungi and animals in
our study, E. cuniculi contained no sequences from
Groups 1 or 2.

the taxon number increases [32] and the fast bootstrap
methods without branch-swapping typically applied to
large datasets may not be reliable at nodes with weak support [33]. None-the-less, because the nodes near the base
of our Bayesian tree were weakly supported, we also constructed a phylogenetic tree using maximum likelihood
methods. We used the PhyML program with 1024 bootstrap replicates to construct a phylogenetic tree with all
162 septins. The maximum likelihood tree gave the same
basic tree topology as the Bayesian tree. For Groups 2, 3
and 5 maximum likelihood support values were similar to
Bayesian support values (Figure 2, 78% versus 0.78, 51%
versus 0.55 and 49% versus 0.55, respectively). For Group
4 the likelihood support value was higher than the Baye-

sian value (91% versus 0.76). For Group 1 the likelihood
support value was much lower than the Bayesian support
value (38% versus 0.8). However, support for Groups 1A
and 1B was very similar by both methods (100% versus
0.96 and 100% versus 1.0).
Proposed names
Many of the septins we identified are listed as hypothetical proteins in GenBank or have been named after less
related septins. We propose to name septins after the most
closely related well-characterized septin within the same
group (Table 1). The clades upon which proposed names
are based are strongly supported and far from the base of
the tree (Figure 2). Using this system, fungal and micro-

sporidial septins from Groups 1–4 would be named Cdc3,
Cdc10, Cdc11, Cdc12, Shs1, Spr3 or Spr28 after the most
closely related S. cerevisiae septin and those from Group 5
would be named AspE after the A. nidulans septin. The
only exception would be fungal septins from S. pombe,
which would continue to be called Spn1-7 because cell
division cycle mutants bearing the Cdc name, but not correlating to the S. cerevisiae numbers, have been isolated
independently. Mammalian and fish septins from Groups

1 and 2 would be named Sept1-13 after the human
septins. Nematode septins would be named Unc59 and
Unc61 after the C. elegans septins and insect septins would
be named Pnut, Sep1, Sep2, Sep4, and Sep5 after D. melanogaster septins.

positions are referenced to Cdc3p of S. cerevisiae.
GTPase domains
The G1 motif (GxxxxGK [ST]; SceCdc3 126–133) was the
most conserved among the septin motifs (Table 2a). Glycines (G) were found in the first and sixth position in
99%–100% and in the fourth position in 94% of septins.

Either K or R occupied the seventh position in 98%. All
animal septins, all Group 1A fungal septins and all
Group5 septins had a perfect consensus G1 motif. Eight
fungal and microsporidial septins from Groups 2, 3 and 4

Prosite search using the extended G1 as query also identified other GTPases, so this extended G1 motif is not septin-specific.
The two consensus amino acids in the established GTPase
G3 motif (DxxG; SceCdc3 204–207) were found in 83%–
94% of septins. Our analysis also showed that the G3
motif consensus for septins could be further modified to
DT [PV]GxG (SceCdc3 204–209) with each additional
position conserved in 86%–93% of septins (Table 2).
Modified G3 motifs were found in all groups except for
the animal and fungal Group 1A (see additional file 1).
In the G4 GTPase motif (NKxD, SceCdc3 286–289) N286
was often replaced by A, S, or G. K and D (SceCdc3 287

and 289) were found in 91% and 99% of septins, respectively. Perfect G4 consensus sequences were found in animal Group 1B and fungal Groups 2A and 4 and in fungi
in Group 1A. Derived G4 motifs were found in fungal
Groups 3 and 5 and in animal members of Group 1A and
2B. We also detected the pattern NxxPxI (SceCdc3 280–
285) immediately upstream of the established G4 motif,
with each of the three conserved amino acids in 91%–
98% of septins. A Prosite search using this extended G4
pattern as query identified other GTPases, so it is not septin-specific.
Coiled-coil domains
The coiled-coil is a common structural motif that forms a
super helix with heptad repeats and mediates protein-pro-

tein interactions [36,37]. It exists in a broad range of proteins involved in numerous cellular processes [38].
Coiled-coil motifs have previously been identified at the
C-terminus of the S. cerevisiae septins Cdc3 and Cdc12
where they are required for septin association and function [21]. A C-terminal coiled-coil has also been identified
in Cdc11, but it is dispensable for function. Cdc10 is
shorter than the other S. cerevisiae septins and lacks the Cterminal coiled-coil. We analyzed all 162 septin
sequences for predicted coiled-coil domains using the
COILS [39] and Multicoil programs [40]. Every member
of the fungal Group 2A (Cdc3p) and the closely related
animal Group 2B contained a predicted coiled-coil
domain (Table 1). Similarly, all members of the fungal
and microsporidial Group 4 (Cdc12p) contained the predicted coiled-coil. None of the animal or fungal septins in
Group 1A (Cdc10p) had a predicted coiled-coil, while all
the animal septins in the sister clade Group 1B (M_II) had
a predicted coiled-coil. None of the nine septins in the filamentous fungal Group 5 (AspE) were strongly predicted
to have the coiled-coil; however, NcrHyp6, MgrHyp6,
CneHyp5 and Gzehyp5 had weakly predicted coiled-coil
domains (average probability across different window
sizes < 0.7, rather than 1). Though most members of the
fungal and microsporidial Group 3 (Cdc11p) had a predicted C-terminal coiled-coil, five of the twenty-nine
septins in Group 3 had no predicted coiled-coil (EcuSep3,
CalSpr28, EgoHyp6, KlaHyp7 and SpoSpn7). Interestingly, theascomycetes that have a Group 3 septin lacking
a predicted coiled-coil contain two other Group 3 paralogs with predicted coiled-coils. However, the microsporidium E. cuniculi has only a single Group 3 septin.
New septin motifs
The Weblogo program assigned bitscores to amino acids
in the established G1, G3 and G4 GTPase motifs ranging
from a low of 2.7 (SceCdc3 position 204) to a high of 4.3
(SceCdc3 position 126). By considering relative frequency
and using positions with bitscores above 2.7, we identified four new septin motifs and designated them Sep1- 4
(Table 2b) and six new conserved single amino acid positions (Table 2c). The Sep1 motif, ExxxxR (SceCdc3 position 237–242) is located between the established G3 and
G4 domains (Figure 1) with each of the two consensus
amino acids conserved in 96–98% of septins. A Prosite
search of the NCBI protein database using the Sep1 motif
returned many proteins that were neither septins nor
GTPases. The Sep2 motif, DxR [VI]Hxxx [YF]F [IL]xP
(SceCdc3 247–259) is located between the G3 and G4
GTPase domains (Figure 1). Each consensus amino acid
was present in 88%–96% of septins. A Prosite search with
the Sep2 motif identified only septins, but not all septins,
making this motif potentially useful for identification of
new septin sequences. Four septins with a P rather than a
V or I at position 250 are all in the SceSpr28 subclade of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/103

Group3. The Sep3 motif, GxxLxxxD (SceCdc3 261–268),
is between the G3 and G4 GTPase domains (Figure 1).
Each consensus amino acid was present in 86%–96% of
septins. A Prosite search with the Sep3 motif returned
GTPases including septins. In position 264, the hydrophobic L is often conservatively replaced by I or V. Only
members of Group5 have the charged residue D at 264.
The Sep4 motif, WG (SceCdc3 364–365), is in the C-terminus within the previously identified "septin unique element" and before the coiled-coil (Figure 1). The amino
acids at these two positions were conserved in 92% of
septins. A Prosite search with the Sep5 motif showed that
it was also found in some other GTPases and hence is not
septin-specific.
In addition to the four septin motifs, we detected six positions that contained single consensus amino acids in
86%–94% of septins (Table 2c). One of these positions,
upstream of the G1 GTPase motif in the polybasic region
(SceCdc3 117; Figure 1), had a G in 99% of animal
septins. In fungal septins it was moderately conserved
except for four of the Group 5 septins where a P was substituted. The remaining five conserved single amino acid
positions were after the G4 motif (SceCdc3 295, 300, 339,
360, and 396). In position 295, 94% of septins had the
acidic residues D or E. However, in five septins from
Group 5 the basic H residue was substituted.
Splice variants
Mammalian septins exhibit complex expression patterns
and can produce a large number of splicing variants [28].
The human septin, SEPT9, spans a 240 kb region, contains
17 exons, and is predicted to have 18 different transcripts
encoding 15 polypeptides [41]. All of the conserved positions identified in our study were predicted to be retained
in all variants encoded by SEPT9. Indeed, all splicing of
human septin transcripts so far reported occurs in the
regions encoding N- or C- termini and not in the regions
encoding the conserved core of the protein.

Discussion
Evolution
The origin of the septins in eukaryotes depends upon the
interpretation of the septin-like sequence we found in
Giardia lamblia. If this is considered a primitive septin,
then a septin-like ancestor existed before the diplomonads arose. This septin-like ancestor was retained in the
diplomonads, animals, fungi and microsporidia, but lost
in plants. If the G. lamblia septin-like sequence is part of a
separate GTPase family that shares some motifs with
septins, then septins may have entered the common
ancestor of animals, fungi and microsporidia via a horizontal gene transfer from bacteria, as proposed by Leipe
[10].

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:103

Which ever origin is correct, our phylogenetic analysis
suggests that septins might have evolved as follows (Figure 6): The ancestral septin sequence duplicated before
the divergence of animals and fungi to become the ancestral Group 1 and Group 2 septins. The ancestral Group 1
septin duplicated and one paralog lost the C-terminal
coiled-coil extension. Animals and fungi retained this
shortened Group 1 paralog which gave rise to Group 1A
septins. The longer paralog containing the C-terminal
extension was lost from fungi, but retained in animals giving rise to Group 1B septins. Within fungal species there is
a single Group 1 paralog, however in many animals, especially mammals, extensive duplication gave rise to multiple Group 1 paralogs. The ancestral Group 2 septin was
retained in both animals and fungi giving rise to Group
2A and Group 2B septins. Fungi have single paralogs of
Group 2 septins, while most animals, especially mammals, have multiple paralogs. In the lineage leading to
fungi and microsporidia, the ancestral Group 1 and
Group 2 septins duplicated giving rise to Group 3 and
Group 4 septins. Unlike the single fungal paralogs of
Group 1 and Group 2, Group 3 and Group 4 septins
duplicated and diverged, giving rise to multiple paralogs,
especially in the ascomycetes. In the lineage leading to
microsporidia, Group 1 and Group 2 septins were lost.
This is consistent with recent views that microsporidia
evolved from fungi [42]. Group 5 septins, found only in
filamentous fungi, either arose early in fungal evolution
and were lost in yeasts or arose relatively recently.
Motifs
Polybasic domain and Septin element
To be considered septin motifs, we required that
sequences be at least as conserved as the GTPase motifs.
While this stringent cut-off undoubtedly eliminated moderately-conserved or clade-specific sequences, it guaranteed the significance of identified positions. Only one
amino acid (SceCdc3 117G) within the ten amino acid
polybasic region previously shown to bind phosphoinositides (Figure 1; SecCdc3 110–120) [20] was conserved enough across all septins to be considered a septin
motif in our analysis. Similarly, only 6 amino acids (sep1
motif and 2 conserved single amino acid positions)
within the previously defined 53 amino acid "septin
unique element" (SceCdc3 360–413) [23] meet our cutoff for septin motifs.
GTPase
Septins have been shown to bind and hydrolyze GTP [23].
Many lines of evidence suggest that guanine-nucleotide
binding by septins is needed for their polymerization;
however, low rates of nucleotide exchange and hydrolysis
in vitro have led to questions about the significance of the
GTPase activity. Consistent with the importance of guanine nucleotide binding for septin function, our analysis

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/103

showed that the G1 GTPase motif, which forms the loop
that interacts with the phosphate group of the nucleotide,
and the G4 motif, which is important for GTP-binding
specificity, were highly conserved, with 154 of 162 (95%)
septins matching the respective consensus sequences (see
additional file 1). In contrast the G3 motif, which binds to
the Mg2+ ion, matched the consensus for 135 of 162
(83%) septins.
Coiled-coil
In S. cerevisiae all septins except for Cdc10p (Group 1A)
are predicted to have a C-terminal region containing a
coiled-coil, a motif implicated in protein-protein interactions. Like Cdc10p, all Group 1A septins are missing the
C-terminal region that contains the coiled-coil. Group 1B
septins are all predicted to contain C-terminal coiledcoils. In elegant work, Versele and Thorner [21] showed
that S. cerevisiae Cdc3p and Cdc12p associate through
their C-termini and that Cdc11p and Cdc12p associate
independently of their C-termini. In our analysis all
Group 2 (Cdc3p) and Group 4 (Cdc12p) septins were predicted to contain C-terminal coiled-coils, while 5 of 29
Group 3 (Cdc11p) septins were not predicted to contain
C-terminal coiled-coils. This pattern of conservation suggests that C-terminal coiled-coil interactions might be
important for the association of all Group 2 (Cdc3p)
septins with Group 4 (Cdc12p) septins while interactions
outside the C-terminus might be important for the association of all Group 2 with Group 3 septins. Animals lack
Group 4 septins, but Group 1B septins likely play the
same role in polymerization by interacting with Group 2
septins. Indeed, mammalian Sept6 (Group 1B) and Sept7
(Group 2B) have been shown to interact via their C-termini leading Versele and Thorner to suggest that the
Sept6–Sept7 complex is the animal counterpart of the
Cdc3p-Cdc12p complex [23]. Group 5 septins, found in
filamentous fungi, lack or have weakly predicted coiledcoils, suggesting that C terminal regions are not important
for their interactions.

Conclusion
We analyzed 162 septins from microsporidia, fungi and
animals. Septins were grouped into five classes, modified
nomenclature based on these five classes was suggested
and there was strong evidence for orthology between
septins from different kingdoms. In addition to derivatives of already known G1, G3 and G4 GTPase motifs,
four new motifs and six conserved single amino acid positions were identified. Though first discovered and beststudied in the yeast S. cerevisiae it has become increasingly
clear that the septins are important in animals. Earlier
work based on septins from only five species suggested
that there were no clear orthologs between the septins in
fungal systems and those in mammals [25] confounding
extrapolation from simple to more complex systems. With

the availability of many more sequences, our work clarifies the relationships among septins and points to which
comparisons are likely to be most informative.

Methods
Database searches
We used the 520-residue Saccharomyces cerevisiae septin
protein Cdc3p (GenBank: gi|2507385) as the initial query
sequence for PSI-BLAST searches against the non-redundant database (All non-redundant GenBank CDS translations+RefSeq Proteins+PDB+SwissProt+PIR+PRF) at
NCBI [43]. PSI-BLAST performs iterative profile searches
by generating position specific scoring matrices to achieve
high sensitivity. Three iterations were run with default
parameters (Expect Value 10, Word Size 3, Blosum62,
Gap Opening Penalty 11, Gap Extension Penalty 1, and
With Inclusion Threshold 0.005) until no new septin or
septin-like sequences were found. We examined each
sequence retrieved from the PSI-BLAST output and
removed duplicated and obviously incomplete sequences.
We classified the remaining sequences as septins or septin-like proteins by examining the three GTP motifs of
septins [25]: G1 (GxxxxGK [S/T]), G3 (DxxG) and G4
(xKxD) and their phylogenetic relationships with other
septins.
Protein alignments
We used CLUSTALX1.8 for protein multiple sequence
alignment [44]. Default parameters were used, as no significant differences were observed when we tested different parameter combinations. Protein weight matrix
Gonnet 250, with Gap Opening Penalty 10 and Gap
Extension Penalty 0.1 was used for pairwise alignments.
Protein weight matrix Gonnet, with Gap Opening 10 and
Gap Extension 0.2 was used for multiple alignments. We
manually modified the multiple alignment output from
ClustalX with the Bioedit program [45]. We used Weblogo
Version 2.8.1 to show the consensus structure of the
sequences [34,35]. Bit scores from the output were also
used to help identify conserved regions.
Reconstruction of phylogenetic trees
We used MrBayes v3.1 for phylogenetic analysis [29]. The
amino acid model was estimated using the setting "aamodelpr = mixed" allowing the program to test and use the
best fitting model for the dataset from 9 fixed rate protein
models. We used 1,500,000 running generations, sample
frequency of 200 and burn in period set to 40,000 to keep
only the stationary phase samples. The chain number was
set to 4 with 1 cold chain and 3 heated chains with heating
coefficient λ = 0.2. Two independent analyses were run
simultaneously and converged. The consensus type was
set to halfcompact. The myosin sequence from Saccharomyces cerevisiae Myo2p (gi|6324902) was used as outgroup. We also used PhyML [46] for maximum likelihood

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/103

with bootstrap analysis of 1,024 replicates. The JTT amino
acid substitution model was used. The proportion of
invariant sites was estimated by maximizing the phylogeny likelihood. The number of relative substitution rate
categories was set to 4 with gamma distribution parameter
equal to 1. Tree topology, branch lengths and rate parameters were optimized.
Domain and secondary structure predictions
We checked each sequence for domains with the Simple
Modular Architecture Research Tool [26,47]. An NCBI
Conserved Domain Search was also used [48]. Sequences
were searched for coiled-coil domains with the COILS
program [39]; default parameters were used. Results from
Multicoil were also considered [40]. Sequences with average probability above 0.7 were considered to have coiledcoil domains. Secondary structure was predicted using
PSIPRED [49].
