The genome sequence of Brucella pinnipedialis
B2/94 sheds light on the evolutionary history of
the genus Brucella

Abstract
Background: Since the discovery of the Malta fever agent, Brucella melitensis, in the 19th century, six terrestrial
mammal-associated Brucella species were recognized over the next century. More recently the number of novel
Brucella species has increased and among them, isolation of species B. pinnipedialis and B. ceti from marine
mammals raised many questions about their origin as well as on the evolutionary history of the whole genus.
Results: We report here on the first complete genome sequence of a Brucella strain isolated from marine
mammals, Brucella pinnipedialis strain B2/94. A whole gene-based phylogenetic analysis shows that five main
groups of host-associated Brucella species rapidly diverged from a likely free-living ancestor close to the recently
isolated B. microti. However, this tree lacks the resolution required to resolve the order of divergence of those
groups. Comparative analyses focusing on a) genome segments unshared between B. microti and B. pinnipedialis,
b) gene deletion/fusion events and c) positions and numbers of Brucella specific IS711 elements in the available
Brucella genomes provided enough information to propose a branching order for those five groups.
Conclusions: In this study, it appears that the closest relatives of marine mammal Brucella sp. are B. ovis and
Brucella sp. NVSL 07-0026 isolated from a baboon, followed by B. melitensis and B. abortus strains, and finally the
group consisting of B. suis strains, including B. canis and the group consisting of the single B. neotomae species.
We were not able, however, to resolve the order of divergence of the two latter groups.

Background
Brucellae are Gram-negative, facultative, intracellular
bacteria that can infect many species of animals and
man. Six species were initially recognized within the
genus Brucella: B. abortus, B. melitensis, B. suis, B. ovis,
B. canis, and B. neotomae [1-3]. This classification is
mainly based on differences in pathogenicity, host preference, and phenotypic characteristics. Four additional species have been included in the genus Brucella since 2007.
These comprise the species B. ceti and B. pinnipedialis

isolated from marine mammals, with cetaceans (dolphin,
porpoise, and whale species) and pinnipeds (various seal
species) as preferred host respectively [4,5]. B. microti
described in 2008 was first isolated from the common
vole and then from the red fox, and from soil [6-8]. The
latest described species is B. inopinata, isolated from an
infected human breast implant, and currently the most
divergent Brucella species at the phenotypic and molecular level [9,10]. The animal or environmental reservoir of
B. inopinata is not known. New Brucella species will
likely be described in the future such as for isolates from
baboons [11], from wild rodents in Australia [12] and for
strain BO2 isolated from a patient with chronic destructive pneumonia [13]. Strain BO2 and strains from wild
Australian rodents have been proposed as a novel lineage
of the B. inopinata species [12,13].

Molecular and phenotypic typing of marine mammal
Brucella strains led to their classification into two species, B. ceti and B. pinnipedialis, according to their preferred host, cetaceans and pinnipeds respectively [5].
However, several subgroups were identified within each
species by molecular typing methods such as multilocus
sequence analysis (MLSA), multilocus VNTR (Variable
Number of Tandem Repeats) analysis (MLVA), or omp2a
and omp2b porin genes [14-19]. Among them one subgroup within B. ceti, exclusively composed of strains isolated from various dolphin species, was proposed to
constitute a separate species with the name B. delphini
[3,14,18]. The isolates from cetaceans from the Pacific
may also constitute a separate species [19]. Three human
cases with naturally acquired infection by Brucella strains
presumably from marine origin were reported, one case
of spinal osteomyelitis from a patient in New Zealand
[20] and two neurobrucellosis cases from Peruvian
patients [21]. Interestingly, these human isolates exhibited the same genotype as strains from cetaceans from
the Pacific [22].
Among their distinctive characteristics at the molecular
and genomic level, marine mammal Brucella strains were
shown to carry in their genomes a higher number of the
insertion sequence element IS711 (or IS6501) [23,24] than
terrestrial mammal Brucella species and biovars with the
exception of B. ovis [15,17,25]. Consequently, infrequent
restriction site-PCR (IRS-PCR) methods and more recently
ligation-mediated PCR (LM-PCR) were applied, taking
into account this higher number of IS711 elements, to
study the genomic diversity of marine mammal strains
[26-28]. These studies confirmed the classification into
two marine mammal Brucella species, each divided in subgroups. In addition, six specific IS711-containing DNA
fragments were detected allowing the molecular identification of B. ceti and its subgroup composed exclusively of
dolphin isolates [17,26-28]. Besides these specific IS711containing fragments another DNA fragment was detected
that was exclusively found in B. pinnipedialis strains, with
the exception of hooded seal isolates, consisting of a putative genomic island [26,27]. The size of this island was
estimated at 62 kbp according to the physical maps made
from the genomes of marine mammal strains by macrorestriction analyses [14].
The taxonomy of Brucella is still controversial, with an
ongoing debate on whether they should be considered as
distinct species or distinct strains of B. melitensis, considering the close proximity of their genomes [29]. We determined and analyzed the complete genome of B.
pinnipedialis B2/94 to bring new insights into the origin of
Brucella isolated from marine mammals as well as their
time of divergence from Brucella isolated from terrestrial
animals.

Results and Discussion
The genome sequence of B. pinnipedialis B2/94 was
determined (30× coverage) by shotgun sequencing with
the GS-FLX technology and the remaining gaps filled
using the standard Sanger technology. Like that of
other Brucella strains, the genome is composed of two
circular chromosomes, of 2,138,342 bp (base-pairs) and
1,260,926 bp in lengths, respectively. Bioinformatic
annotation predicted the presence of 3,342 protein
coding genes, 55 tRNAs and 9 ribosomal RNAs. The
comparison with the known genomes of other Brucella
species revealed the presence of 90 pseudogenes. The
23S rDNA sequence of B. pinnipedialis B2/94 was
found similar to that of other Brucella species, in contrast with the anomalous and unexpected 23S ribosomal RNA sequence previously described for B. microti
[30].
Genome structure and whole gene set phylogeny

The phylogenetic placement of B. pinnipedialis B2/94
was assessed with the help of a whole gene tree including
all orthologous genes from Brucella strains available in
the complete genome division of GenBank, completed by
sequence data from selected Brucella strains of particular
phylogenetic relevance, either deposited in the whole
genome shotgun (WGS) division of GenBank, or available from other sources (see Methods). This includes
sequences from B. neotomae, 10 sequences from marine
mammal Brucella strains, Brucella sp. B02, B. inopinata
BO1, Brucella sp. 83/13 or Brucella sp. NF2653. The
resulting tree (Figure 1) readily shows that the Brucella
species with the highest sequence similarity with B. pinnipedialis B2/94 and whose complete genome is available
is B. microti CCM 4915. This is a consequence of the
relatively slow evolution rate of those two species rather
than reflecting a particular phylogenetic affinity The central position occupied by B. microti, just at the root of
host-associated Brucella species, is also confirmed. This
tree distinguishes five major groups, the B. suis strains
(shaded rectangle A, Figure 1), the different B. melitensis
and B. abortus strains, also well separated from each
other (rectangle B), another group with B. ovis and
Brucella sp. NVSL 07-0026 (rectangle C), and marine
mammal Brucella strains (rectangle D). B. neotomae
remains isolated in this tree and constitutes the fifth
group. However, the resolution of this tree is insufficient
to infer the relative order of divergence of those different
groups. Moreover, while bootstrap values in this tree are
in general very strong (99 or 100%), the branching (D,(C,
B)) proposed in the maximum likelihood tree is generally
not supported, with a bootstrap value of 12%, prompting
for a finer analysis of the events shaping the Brucella evolutionary tree.

Figure 1 Genus Brucella phylogenic tree based on a concatenated alignment of orthologous genes. Phylogenetic representation of
species in the genus Brucella based on a concatenated alignment of orthologous genes belonging to Ochrobactrum intermedium and 39
different Brucella strains or species whose genomes are nearly complete. At each leave of the tree is summarized the presence or absence
pattern of the largest sequence fragments being unshared between B. microti CCM 4915 and B. pinnipedialis B2/94 (black square: presence, gray
square: partial presence, white square: absence). Because of the very different scale of divergence of the different species in consideration in this
work, the figure has been split in two parts. The upper part is a bird eye view showing the more distant O. intermedium, Brucella sp. B02, B.
inopinata, Brucella sp. NF2653 and Brucella sp. 83/13 while the lower part displays the host-adapted Brucella species and B. microti. All nodes
have bootstrap values above 99 (on 100 replicates) except when noted in red.

The genome sequences of B. microti CCM 4915 and
B. pinnipedialis B2/94 were found to be remarkably conserved even at the nucleotide level, allowing to generate a
complete alignment of the chromosomes of the two species from which a list of all indels (insertions and deletions) (available as Additional file 1, Table S1 and
Additional file 2, Table S2) was easily obtained. In spite
of the overall similarity of these two genomes, this alignment revealed major changes in genome structure, as
large segments unshared between the two species. The
alignment from the largest chromosome exhibited 238

gapped positions with the largest insert in B. microti
being 2,653 bp long, and the largest in B. pinnipedialis
being 21,713 bp long. The alignment from the small
chromosome exhibits 151 gapped positions, the largest
insert being 18,341 bp long in B. microti and 67,389 bp
long in B. pinnipedialis. The total number of indels (389)
found in comparing these two species is thus smaller
than the 405 indels found in comparing B. microti CCM
4915 and B. suis 1330 [30]. The complete alignment contains a total of 3,290,621 aligned positions (2,104,923 and
1,185,698 per chromosome), with 0.10% of nucleotide

Audic et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:200

changes in aligned regions (2,195 and 1,200 nucleotide
changes, respectively). This fraction of nucleotide substitution is also smaller than what was observed between
B. microti CCM 4915 and B. suis 1330, where a 0.16%
divergence was reported [30].
Detailed analysis of the largest unshared sequence
regions and the branching order of host associated
Brucella species

The evolutionary history of the largest segments unshared
between B. microti CCM 4915 and B. pinnipedialis B2/94
was analyzed by examining the structure of the orthologous loci in the other Brucella species for which sequence
data was available (see Methods). On the large chromosome, the 2 largest indels are 21 kbp, and 2.6 kbp in
length. On the small chromosome, the largest indels are
67 kbp, 18 kpb, 11 kbp and 2.8 kbp in length. All other
indels are at most the size of an IS711 insertion sequence
(843 bp). The presence/absence of the above genomic
inserts was assessed in other Brucella strains (see Methods). For each segment, we recorded the number of
nucleotides with homologues in the other Brucella genomes (Additional file 3, Table S3). The presence/absence
of those segments is reported at the leaves of the tree
(Figure 1) as filled squares. The evolutionary history of
those unshared genome segments, treated as discrete characters, was reconstructed by parsimony analysis using the
Mesquite software (see Methods), and represented as a
cladogram in Additional file 4, Figure S1. The proposed
evolutionary scenario corresponding to those unshared
segments is discussed below, the largest ones first.
The locus of BMI_II545-6 in B. microti CCM 4915 is
occupied in the B. pinnipedialis B2/94 small chromosome by a 67,389 bp insert (position: 520,136 to 587,524)
which is present in a number of Brucella strains from
marine mammals and partially in B. ovis ATCC 25840.
The gene arrangements of this genomic region in B. pinnipedialis, B. microti and B. ovis are depicted in Figure 2.
This region is flanked on both sides by an IS711 element
(respectively BPI_II536-7 and BPI_II602-3), at a location
where a sole copy of the IS711 element is found in
B. microti CCM 4915 (BMI_II545-6), as in all Brucella
strains lacking this insert. This region is partially found
in B. ovis ATCC 25840, except in the interval between
BPI_II545 and BPI_II576 deleted from B. ovis. The deletion in B. ovis ATCC 25840 occurred inside the gene
BOV_A0488, whose 85 first amino acids are similar to
BPI_II577 and whose last 100 amino acids are similar to
BPI_II544. This interval exhibits a few protein coding
genes or their remnants, with similarities mainly found in
distant alphaproteobacteria i.e. excluding Brucella and
Ochrobactrum. In particular, two pseudogenes, BPI_II545
and BPI_II548, separated by one IS711 element, appear
to be the remnants of two consecutive Paracoccus

Page 4 of 10

denitrificans genes coding for 5-oxoprolinase (Pden_
4408-9) and are preceded by an AraC-family transcriptional regulator (BPI_II544) with similarity into the same
organism (Pden_4410). The same three genes are also
found grouped together but in different orders in the
genomes of several betaproteobacteria e.g Bordetella
avium (BAV3293-5) or Verminephrobacter eiseniae
(Veis_1518-20). Two consecutive genes, etfA (BPI_II555)
and etfB (BPI_II556) are also present on the large chromosome with 100% nucleotide identity. We also observed
4 components of a spermidine/putrescine ABC-transporter (BPI_II564-7) found colinearly in the genomes of e.g.
Roseobacter denitrificans (RD1_3862-5) or Silicibacter
pomeroyi (SPOA381-4). We found similarities to two
consecutive genes of Parvibaculum lavamentivorans
(Plav_0386-7), similarities to Plav_0387 being noticed on
both sides of the BPI_II574-5 ISBm1 transposase gene.
Other genes like the aldehyde dehydrogenase BPI_II571
have best matches in Brucella and Ochrobactrum, but
with 73% similarity only at the amino acid level. Several
transposase genes are also present. This large 67 kbp
fragment probably found its origin in the common ancestor of the marine mammal Brucella species and B. ovis, as
attested by its partial presence in B. ovis. The structure of
this segment suggests a grouping of B. ovis with marine
mammal Brucella sp. (Additional file 4, Figure S1-a). It
may have been lost thereafter several times, in Brucella
sp. strain NVSL 07-006 isolated from a baboon and along
the B. ceti and B. pinnipedialis lineages, putatively by
recombination of the two IS711 copies.
A 21,713 bp fragment on the large chromosome (position: 259,190 to 280,902 in B. pinnipedialis B2/94) is
not found in B. microti CCM 4915. This fragment is
present in all B. melitensis and B. abortus strains and in
B. neotomae, but its occurrence is quite variable among
B. ceti and B. pinnipedialis strains and even among
B. suis strains, where it is observed in the earliest diverging B. suis 513 and B. suis ATCC 23445, but absent
otherwise. This fragment starts with a phage integrase
gene (BPI_I248) and ends with a tRNA (BPI_I278)
which was the likely insertion site. An IS711 element is
inserted within a gene (BPI_II256) that remained intact
in B. melitensis 16 M (BMEI1694) and B. ovis ATCC
25840 (BOV_0245). This fragment encodes a flagellar
protein FlgJ (BPI_I260). The other putative genes in this
region have no convincing similarities to annotated proteins. This 21 kbp fragment (Additional file 4, Figure
S1-b) probably entered the Brucella genomes after
B. microti divergence, and disappeared separately on
several branches. It confirms the grouping of B. ceti
Cudo, B. ceti B1/94, B. ceti M490/95/1 and Brucella sp.
F5/99. Its presence in the genome of B. neotomae 5K33
and absence in B. suis strains except for B. suis ATCC
23445 and B. suis 513 suggest its insertion prior to the

divergence of the B. suis and B. neotomae lineage, and a
subsequent loss in the B. suis lineage.
A 18,341 bp region on the small chromosome (between
BMI_II357 and BMI_II381) is absent from the B. pinnipedialis B2/94 genome (position: 344,671-363,011 in B.
microti CCM 4915). This region is present in B. microti,
B. suis, B. canis, B. ceti, Brucella sp. F5/99, B. neotomae
and absent in B. abortus, B. melitensis, B. ovis and B. pinnipedialis. Additionally, a partial match was found in the
genome of Brucella sp. B02. In this region, the presence
of genes encoding TraI-J proteins involved in bacterial
conjugation can be noted. Like the above 67 kbp fragment, this 18 kbp fragment (Additional file 4, Figure S1c) supports a divergence of the B. melitensis/B. abortus
clade prior to the separation of B. ovis, Brucella sp. strain
NVSL 07-006 and marine mammal Brucella strains. It
might have appeared before B. microti divergence, and
disappeared several times, in particular from the branch
leading to the B. abortus/B. melitensis clade and from the
branch leading to the B. pinnipedialis clade.

The 11 kbp region on the small chromosome is a
phage related region discussed in [30] and unique to B.
microti (position: 1,038,883-1,050,624 in B. microti CCM
4915). It will not be discussed further (Additional file 4,
Figure S1-d).
Still on the small chromosome, a 2,881 bp region (position: 1,082,391-1,085,271 in B. microti CCM 4915)
encodes genes BMI_II1086-8. This fragment (Additional
file 4, Figure S1-e) appeared before B. microti divergence,
and is absent from the branch leading to B. ovis and Brucella sp. strain NVSL 07-0026, but also from the branch
leading to B. pinnipedialis M292/94/1 and B. pinnipedialis
B2/94, separating those two species from B. pinnipedialis
M163/99/10. Closer examination reveals that this 2.8 kbp
fragment is absent in B. ovis because it belongs to a much
larger 44.5 kbp region deleted from B. ovis [31] and also
partially deleted from Brucella sp. NVSL 07-0026, where
an approximately 30 kbp long region is missing (pos:
1,117,180 to 1143394 in B. pinnipedialis B2/94 small chromosome). This finding supports both grouping of the

Audic et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:200
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/200

B. pinnipedialis M292/94/1 and B2/94 strains, and that of
B. ovis with Brucella sp. strain NVSL 07-0026.
Between BMI_I949 and BMI_I953, there is a 2,653 bp
region deleted from the B. pinnipedialis B2/94 large
chromosome (position: 928,716-931,368 in B. microti
CCM 4915) but also from B. ovis ATCC 25840, Brucella
sp. NVSL 07-0026 and all B. melitensis and B. abortus
strains. Interestingly, this deletion occurred inside a
gene (encoding an ABC transporter), thus showing that
it is a deletion and not an acquisition event. This region
(Additional file 4, Figure S1-f) is particularly informative
because it clearly separates Brucella strains into two
groups. This fragment was present in ancestral Brucella,
and then lost after the divergence of the B. suis clade, of
B. neotomae, of B. microti and prior to the divergence of
B. abortus and B. melitensis, B. ovis and Brucella sp.
strain NVSL 07-2026, and finally marine mammal Brucella species. An interesting exception is found in B.
abortus B3196, where this ABC transporter gene is
intact. This feature clearly suggests a divergence of the
B. suis and B. neotomae group before that of the other
host-associated Brucella.
IS711 insertion sequences

IS711 insertion sequences [32] account for a large number
of gaps within the complete genome alignment of B. pinnipedialis B2/94 and B. microti CCM 4915. In total, 19
IS711 elements were identified on the large chromosome
and 12 on the small chromosome of B. pinnipedialis. We
looked for the occurrence of those insertion sequences in
the available complete genomes of Brucella (Methods) and
reported their position in Figure 3 and Additional file 5,
Table S4. Although it is difficult to analyze transposable
repetitive elements in unfinished genomes (as they are
often the ones precluding genome assembly) [33], we
included two other partial genomes in our analysis,
but where an abundant number of IS711 elements
were observed, B. ceti Cudo and Brucella sp. strain NVSL
07-0026.
Figure 3 shows that 6 IS711 insertion sequences are
found in all selected Brucella strains (IS711 groups numbered 1, 4, 12, 13, 26, and 31). We also observed that 4
IS711 elements were uniquely shared by B. ovis ATCC
25840 and Brucella sp. strain NVSL 07-006 (groups 41,
43, 48 and 54), supporting the grouping of those two species, already noticed when discussing the whole gene tree,
and confirmed by the large deletion around the 2.8 kbp
fragment discussed previously. Those two species were the
likely subjects of an intense IS711 transposition activity,
with 14 elements being uniquely found in B. ovis and 9
being uniquely found in Brucella sp. NVSL 07-006.
Among the 31 IS711 positions found in B. pinnipedialis
B2/94, 21 are shared with B. ceti Cudo among which 12
are found only in B. pinnipedialis B2/94 and B. ceti Cudo,

Page 6 of 10

and absent from all other strains (groups 5-9, 17, 18, 19,
21, 23 and 24).
Difference in gene content

Comparing orthologous loci (present in both B. microti
CCM 4915 and B. pinnipedialis B2/94 genomes), we
found that the number of pseudogenes in the genome of
B. pinnipedialis B2/94 was larger than that in the genome
of B. microti CCM 4915 (30 for B. microti on chromosome
I and 48 for B. pinnipedialis, 16 for B. microti on chromosome II and 42 for B. pinnipedialis). This was also noticed
when comparing B. microti CCM 4915 and B. suis 1330,
and was attributed to a slower evolution rate in B. microti.
The genes that are potentially different in both species are
reported in Additional file 6, Table S5.
Among the genes altered in B. pinnipedialis B2/94, many
are components of ABC transporters. Those genes are
highlighted in Additional file 6, Table S5. We found 17
genes related to ABC transporters that are impaired, on a
total of 90 impaired genes. In the B. pinnipedialis genome
we identified approximately 249 ABC transporter-related
intact genes on a total of 3,342 protein coding genes. This
output is highly improbable (p-value = 1.e-4, chi-square
test) and strongly suggest that ABC transporters were specifically degraded in B. pinnipedialis and more generally in
host-associated Brucella species. Beside ABC type transport systems, many other genes involved in transport are
found impaired in B. pinnipedialis B2/94: a CorA family
transporter BPI_I592 (ortholog BMI_I558), an EmrB/Qaca
family drug resistance transporter BPI_I1098 (ortholog
BMI_I1064), the dipeptide transport system permease protein DppC (BPI_I1637, ortholog BMI_I1597), an outer
membrane autotransporter BPI_I2072 (ortholog
BMI_I2035), a glucose/galactose transporter BPI_II188
(ortholog BMI_II187), a cadmiun-translocating P-type
ATPase BPI_II1260 (ortholog BMI_II1204), and finally a
putative transport protein BPI_II453 (ortholog BMI_II468).
One of those ABC transporter genes, BPI_I1818, exhibits an interesting feature. A frameshift difference
between the B. pinnipedialis B2/94 and B. microti CCM
4915 sequences merges the membrane and ATP-binding
components (BMI_I1778-9) of a thiamin ABC transporter into a single reading frame. A blast (tblastn) search
of the BPI_I1818 gene sequence against the nucleotide
sequences of the other Brucella strains shows that this
gene fusion occurred in all marine mammal strains studied, except for B. ceti M13/05/1 and M644/93 which
represent the distinct dolphin subgroup of strains within
B. ceti mentioned above.

Conclusions
Time of appearance of marine mammal Brucella species

It has been suggested [14] that the divergence of species
in the genus Brucella could have been concomitant with

Figure 3 IS711 positions in selected Brucella genomes. Schematic representation of the position of IS711 elements in the genome of
selected Brucella including currently completely assembled Brucella (names with an asterisk) and two genomes still in partial form (B. ceti Cudo
and Brucella sp. NVSL 07-0026). IS711 positions are noted by a star, some of them in smaller size to increase legibility. Orthologous IS are joined
by a line. Each group of connected IS, even isolated ones, is given an identifier which allows to find the corresponding entry in Table S4 which
lists the genomic positions of the IS711 elements. Chromosomes (or contigs) are depicted as rectangles. The chromosomes of B. melitensis 16 M
are reversed with respect to the original genomic coordinates.

the divergence of their mammalian hosts, 60 millions
years (my) ago. However this is inconsistent with the fact
that the hosts of B. ceti and B. pinnipedialis did not
diverge at the same time. The ancestors of pinnipeds
where carnivores and Higdon et al. [34] used molecular
data to estimate the split between ursids and pinnipeds
to 35.7 ± 2.63 (= mean ± SE) my, and fossil records
report early pinnipeds 35 my ago [35]. Cetaceans went
back to the sea much earlier, the oldest known cetaceans
date back to the Eocene, 55 my ago [36]. If we consider
divergence in the 16S rRNA gene sequence, and referring
to B. microti which has a central position, B. pinnipedialis, B. melitensis, B. abortus, B. suis (perhaps with the
exception of B. suis 513, which has 2 (nt) differences, C> T at position 11 and G- > T at position 1468), B. ovis,
B. canis have all identical sequences, and B. neotomae

has 1 bp difference (C- > T at position 541). Using the
estimate of 1-2% of change in 16S rRNA sequence per 50
my, 1 bp difference (which really should be considered as
a maximal) corresponds to 0.07% change, and a divergence time of 1.75-3.5 my. This time estimate is probably
a crude overestimation and recent work [37], using single
nucleotide polymorphisms from 13 genomes, showed
that most Brucella species probably diverged 86,000 to
296,000 years ago. This analysis reveals that the divergence time of Brucella sp. found today in marine mammals is totally incompatible with the divergence time of
their hosts. A fortuitous contamination of cetaceans and
pinnipeds, probably via the food chain, may explain better
this transmission of Brucella to the marine mammals.
This also opens the remote possibility of marine Brucella
infecting terrestrial mammals.

On the order of appearance of host-associated Brucella
species

The analysis of distinctive genomic regions between
B. microti CCM 4915 and B. pinnipedialis B2/94 as well as
the study of additional markers reveal the order of appearance of the different Brucella species. It is clearly apparent
that most of the events following the divergence of
B. microti from the classical Brucella species occurred in a
very small amount of time, as if something caused a sudden radiation in this lineage and a subsequent adaptation
of the organisms to their hosts. Here we summarize some
of the major evolutionary events that highlight the evolutionary history of the genus Brucella.
Following the divergence of B. microti, the next evolutionary event that we can trace is the 2.6 kbp fragment
clear disappearance, which tells us that the two next
Brucella groups to diverge were B. suis and B. neotomae.
We did not find any good marker in favor of a prior divergence of one versus the other.
Marine mammal Brucella species as well as B. ovis and
Brucella sp. NVSL 07-0026 share the presence of a high
number of IS711 elements, and it has been demonstrated
that IS711 transposition is still an active process in B. ovis
and B. pinnipedialis [38]. Those insertion elements are
much less numerous in B. melitensis and B. abortus strains
and we thus assume that IS711 transposition events
occurred quite abundantly after the divergence of B. melitensis/B. abortus. In this group, B. abortus strains share a
unique feature which is a genomic 600 kbp inversion in
the small chromosome, as clearly depicted on Figure 1 of
reference [39].
The whole gene tree, where B. ovis and Brucella sp.
NVSL 07-0026 cluster together, the 4 IS711 elements positions that they have in common and not shared with
B. pinnipedialis B2/94 as well as the large deletion that
those two species share, in the region surrounding the 2.8
kbp deletion in B. pinnipedialis, all those facts support the
grouping of B. ovis with Brucella sp. NVSL 07-0026. The
grouping of marine mammal Brucella strains that we
observe in the tree with early divergence of B. ceti M13/
05/1 and M644/93 is also reflected by the gene fusion
event mentioned earlier. Grouping of B. pinnipedialis
M292/94 and B2/94 is supported by the loss of the 18 kbp
fragment in these two strains.
The explosive radiation in the genus Brucella

There is a clear transition in the genus Brucella evolutionary tree. The first Brucella discovered were the host-associated Brucella species, but more recently, B. microti was
isolated as the first representative of a fast growing list of
free-living Brucella. This biochemically highly active bacteria was found to share more phenotypic traits with
Ochrobactrum than with the host-associated Brucella species [6]. We proposed earlier [30] that the transition

Page 8 of 10

between a free-living and an host-associated life style
could have resulted from the modification in the 23S ribosomal RNA gene sequence with putative effects on the
growth rate of the bacteria. A slow growth rate has often
been advocated for intra-cellular bacteria, as their survival
is often dependent on the survival of their hosts [40].
Brucella with this change in 23S structure and its impact
on growth rate became suddenly more adapted to an hostassociated life style than to a free-living style, and progressively adapted to distinct sets of hosts, giving rise to the
main lineages of host-associated Brucella species that are
encountered today.

Methods
Sequencing and origin of sequence data used for
comparative work

Genome was assembled from 430,042 paired GS-FLX
reads of average length 229, giving approximately a 30×
coverage of the genome, and directed sequencing of
the remaining gaps was performed using 193 additional
Sanger sequencing reactions. The genome sequence is
deposited in the complete genome division of GenBank
under project ID 41867 and accession numbers CP002078
and CP002079. Genomic sequence data of all Brucella
strains mentioned in this work can be conveniently downloaded from a unique location at the Pathosystems
Resource Integration Center web site [41], or otherwise
from the complete genome and whole genome shotgun
divisions of GenBank [42]. Origin of the sequence data is
listed in Supplementary Table 3. Most sequences originate
from the Brucella group project at the Broad Institute,
conducted by Davis O’Callaghan, Adrian Whatmore and
Renee Tsolis [43] or from the Pathosystems Resource Integration Center of the Virginia Bioinformatics Institute
[41].
Whole gene tree

Whole gene tree was build using gene sequences from all
available Brucella as well as Ochrobactrum intermedium.
The procedure used to build the tree is similar to that
reported in [30]. Briefly, 1125 orthologous genes from 39
Brucella plus genes from O. intermedium were used.
Orthologous genes were selected using the following procedure. A file containing nucleotide gene sequences for
the selected organisms was compared to itself using blastn
[44] (parameters: -b 100 -v 100 -F F -e 1.e-20). The resulting output file was subjected to clustering using the
Markov chain clustering algorithm [45]. In the resulting
cluster list, we selected the clusters with only one unique
member per species. Genes from each cluster were then
aligned using MUSCLE [46] (default parameters). The following alignments were concatenated, resulting in an
alignment of 40 sequences, with 1,078,083 positions,
cleaned with Gblock [47] (default parameters), which

Audic et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:200

reduced it to 945,578 positions. From this multiple alignment, on which 767,738 sites without polymorphisms and
2189 distinct patterns were found, a tree was inferred by
maximum likelihood using PhyML [48], with 100 bootstrap replicates.

the unshared sequence fragments along the Brucella evolutionary tree.
The tree is represented as a cladogram with the same topology as that
of the whole gene tree (Figure 1). Plots are generated using Mesquite.

Unshared genome segments, tracing segments history

The nucleotide sequence of the genome fragment coming
either from B. pinnipedialis B2/94 or B. microti CCM
4915 was used as a query for blastn search (e-value = 1.e100, no filter) against the nucleotide sequences of the
remaining Brucella. For each target genome, the number
of distinct nucleotide positions that had a hit was recorded
in Additional file 3, Table S3. Presence or absence of a
given fragment is represented in Figure 1 alongside the
whole gene tree. The history of those genome segments
was subsequently traced using the Mesquite software
package [49] on cladograms reflecting the topology
obtained from the whole gene tree (Figure 1). Character
history was computed using parsimony analysis, with presence or absence of a genome segment treated as a discrete category character.
Across genomes identification of IS711 element positions

A database containing the complete genomes of the
Brucella species under study was compiled. We
searched this database for the occurrence of IS711 using
the nucleotide sequence of one element from B. pinnipedialis as query, using the blastn program (parameters:
-b 1000 -v 1000, limiting to hits with a score of 500).
We extracted the corresponding segments, adding 500
nucleotides of context on both side. We then masked
this file so that the IS711 sequence itself was replaced
by × in the sequence. A subsequently blastn search of
this file against itself allowed us to recover the orthologous IS711 positions along the different Brucella genomes (listed in Additional file 5, Table S4), used for the
representation in Figure 3.
