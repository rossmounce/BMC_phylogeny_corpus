Abstract
Background: Horizontal gene transfer plays an important role in evolution because it sometimes
allows recipient lineages to adapt to new ecological niches. High genes transfer frequencies were
inferred for prokaryotic and early eukaryotic evolution. Does horizontal gene transfer also impact
phylogenetic reconstruction of the evolutionary history of genomes and organisms? The answer to
this question depends at least in part on the actual gene transfer frequencies and on the ability to
weed out transferred genes from further analyses. Are the detected transfers mainly false positives,
or are they the tip of an iceberg of many transfer events most of which go undetected by current
methods?
Results: Phylogenetic detection methods appear to be the method of choice to infer gene
transfers, especially for ancient transfers and those followed by orthologous replacement. Here we
explore how well some of these methods perform using in silico transfers between the terminal
branches of a gamma proteobacterial, genome based phylogeny. For the experiments performed
here on average the AU test at a 5% significance level detects 90.3% of the transfers and 91% of
the exchanges as significant. Using the Robinson-Foulds distance only 57.7% of the exchanges and
60% of the donations were identified as significant. Analyses using bipartition spectra appeared
most successful in our test case. The power of detection was on average 97% using a 70% cut-off
and 94.2% with 90% cut-off for identifying conflicting bipartitions, while the rate of false positives
was below 4.2% and 2.1% for the two cut-offs, respectively. For all methods the detection rates
improved when more intervening branches separated donor and recipient.
Conclusion: Rates of detected transfers should not be mistaken for the actual transfer rates; most
analyses of gene transfers remain anecdotal. The method and significance level to identify potential
gene transfer events represent a trade-off between the frequency of erroneous identification (false
positives) and the power to detect actual transfer events.

Background
Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is postulated to play an
important role in evolution because sometimes the transferred genes allow the recipient to adapt to new ecological
niches (e.g.: [1-4]). No type of gene appears to be immune

to horizontal transfer [5]; however, most of the recently
transferred genes appear to belong to a different pool of
genes as compared to housekeeping genes [6-8]. Some
transfers will undoubtedly provide a selective advantage
to the recipient, for example those genes that allow the

recipient to occupy a new ecological niche; however,
many gene transfers appear to be selectively neutral and
nearly neutral [7,9]. Even in the case of an orthologous
displacement, where the transferred gene replaces an
incumbent gene and is permanently fixed in the recipient
lineage [10,11], the selective advantage for the recipient
lineage is not always apparent, and the displacement at
least in some instances might be a random process.
An assessment of the importance of HGT in microbial
evolution in general, and in phylogenetic reconstruction
in particular, depends in part on the frequency with which
genes are transferred. A few phylogenetic misplacements
due to HGT were recently suggested [7,12]; but many have
expressed the opinion that these events will be the rare
exception rather than the rule (e.g. [13,14]). The potential
of HGT to create phylogenetic artifacts undoubtedly
depends on the HGT frequency. Are the currently detectable transfers mainly false positives [15], or are they the tip
of an iceberg of many transfer events most of which go
undetected by current methods [1,16]?
The known methods of HGT detection can be divided into
parametric and phylogenetic [17]. Parametric methods
are based on the detection of atypical sequence composition for genome regions in comparison with a whole
genome, whereas phylogenetic methods search for conflicts between the phylogeny inferred for a gene and the
assumed organismal phylogeny. It appears that the different approaches detect largely non-overlapping sets of
transfer events [18,19]. Because of sequence amelioration,
parametric methods are limited to detect recent transfers
[20], and their success hinges on donor and recipient having different sequence characteristics [21-23]. In contrast,
phylogenetic methods are limited because they rely on
homologous sequences being available from other organisms separating donor and recipient. Furthermore, other
processes different from HGT can give rise to incongruence between gene and presumed organismal phylogeny.
Becerra and collaborators introduced in silico transfer to
test the efficiency of parametric methods [23]. Here we
extend their approach by applying phylogenetic methods
to detect in silico HGTs. As a test case we used orthologous
gene families from 13 proteobacterial genomes (Figure 1)
that were shown by different approaches to contain only
few detectable HGT events [24,25]. It is possible that this
dataset contains few, or many, undetected gene transfer
events; certainly the individual gene phylogenies are not
all congruent with one another (Figure 2). The conflicts
with the reference phylogeny could either be due to the
evolutionary histories of genes actually being different, or,
more likely, due to the limited amount of phylogenetic
information present in the individual gene phylogenies.
We chose this dataset because it provides a realistic back-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/45

drop against which to detect additional in silico transfer
events. We test three approaches for their efficiency to
detect HGT events: the AU test [26], the Symmetric Difference, or Robinson and Foulds distance [27] and Bipartition spectra or Lento plots [24,28].
The AU test, or approximately unbiased test [26], is based on
the confidence of phylogenetic tree selection. For each tree
tested on a dataset, the AU test estimates the probability
that the tree might be the true tree describing the history
of the dataset under consideration. The greater the P-value
produced by AU test, the greater the probability that the
tested tree is the true tree [26]. The AU test has been
designed for obtaining the confidence set of trees using
maximum-likelihood. Not only one best tree should be
considered, but all the trees from a confidence set, i.e.
trees with P-value higher than a significance level alpha.
The trees that are not included in the confidence set are
rejected. The smaller the P-value for a given tree, the more
certain can this tree be rejected as reflecting the history of
the dataset. If a dataset rejects the organismal phylogeny
with significance level alpha, this dataset is considered
incompatible with the organismal phylogeny, and one of
the reasons for this incompatibility is HGT, although in
the analysis of real gene families other reasons for incompatibility, for example unrecognized paralogy, need to be
considered as well. The significance level gives the probability that the dataset erroneously is considered incompatible with the organismal tree.
Using the similar SH test [29] in an analysis of 13 gamma
proteobacteria only few gene phylogenies were determined as incompatible with the consensus phylogeny
[25]. The authors' concluded that therefore gene transfer
should be considered rare [25]. See [30] for a controversial discussion of this assertion.
Bipartition spectra or Lento plots break the phylogenetic
information contained in a dataset into small quanta of
information. The Lento plot [28] was adopted to comparative genome analyses [24] by giving the number of gene
families that support a bipartition, and the number of
gene families that support a conflicting bipartition. Two
conflicting bipartitions cannot coexist on the same bifurcating tree. Advantages of bipartition analyses are that a
genome wide consensus (the plurality bipartitions) can be
extracted without combining genes into a single dataset,
and that individual splits or bipartitions are considered
and not the whole gene phylogeny. Gene families that at
a chosen level of support conflict with one or more of the
plurality bipartitions are considered incompatible and as
candidates for HGTs. The case of orthologs from the 13
gamma proteobacterial genomes is particularly useful for
this approach, because the dataset contains eight bipartitions supported by the majority of gene families, whereas

Example1of Artificial Transfers between Species
Example of Artificial Transfers between Species. The topology of the depicted tree was calculated from 236 gene families using the majority-rule consensus method; branch lengths were calculated from 16S rRNA. The tree should be considered
as unrooted. To calculate SPR distances (Figure 2C) the tree was considered as rooted in the branch leading to (Xylella fastidiosa, Xanthomonas campestris and X. citri). The double-headed arrows indicate the in silico exchanges analyzed in Figure 3.

for other groups of bacteria the number of bipartitions
with majority support is much smaller [24].
Finally, we used the difference between organismal history and the individual gene phylogeny as a measure of
incompatibility between two trees. The Symmetric Difference, or Robinson and Foulds distance[27] gives the
number of bipartitions that are present in one tree and
absent in the other. In contrast to the Lento plot approach,
this metric does not take into account the statistical significance of individual branches. To obtain a significance
value we used the distribution of distances between the
gene and the organismal phylogeny before the in silico
transfer (Figure 2B). To test the different approaches we
performed a series of in silico experiments simulating gene
transfers between species for a well-studied (e.g.,
[24,25,30]) set of 13 gamma-proteobacteria.

Results and discussion
For a set of 13 gamma proteobacetria 236 gene families
were assembled using the strict reciprocal top scoring
BLAST hit method (see Methods for details). For each
gene family a maximum likelihood tree was reconstructed. The tree depicted in Figure 1 was calculated from
16S rRNA sequences using maximum likelihood [31]. Its
topology is identical to the majority-rule consensus tree
[32] calculated from all individual gene family trees. In
the in silico experiments, two types of transfer were simulated: exchange of genes between two species and donation of a gene by one species to another. Exchange of
genes between two species simulates a transfer that
occurred somewhere along the two terminal branches
leading to the two extant species, donation of a gene by
one species to another represents a recent transfer that
leads to two organisms having identical sequences, and
both of these organisms are included in the analysis. In

The AU-test was applied to the original dataset, and the distribution of AU-test results is depicted as a function of the significance level. Histogram bars give the number of all gene families that were different from the consensus tree (Figure 1) at the

calculated between the consensus tree and each individual gene tree. The mean distance between gene tree and consensus is
3.37 with the standard deviation of 2.32. Panel C gives the number of edits (SPR events corresponding to HGTs) calculated
according to [56]. To illustrate that the results do not depend on a particular reference tree, we used three different trees:
Tree 1 is the consensus tree depicted in Figure 1, tree 2 and 3 are the trees that together with tree 1 were reported as showing the least amount of conflict with the individual gene phylogenies (trees 2 and 3 in Figure 2 of [25]).

case of the exchanges, some of the genome pairs will simulate more ancient transfers than others (e.g., Yersinia pestis with E. coli, versus Pseudomonas aeroginosa with Vibrio
cholerae) depending on the lengths of the terminal
branches. In case of the donation, all of the transfers simulate recent events. All possible transfers were simulated
for each gene tree and for each pair of species. Each gene
tree with in silico exchange was compared against the consensus tree (Figure 1) using three different approaches: AU
test [26], Symmetric Difference of Robinson and Foulds
[27] and Bipartition Spectra [24].
AU test
The AU test, or approximately unbiased test, assesses the
confidence of phylogenetic tree selection [26]. The AU test
estimates the probability that a given tree is the true tree
according to which a dataset in question was generated.
For each family of orthologous genes we test, if the gene
family could have been generated according to the organismal phylogeny without any gene transfer. As organismal
tree we use the consensus tree calculated from the individual gene trees using the majority-rule consensus method
(see Methods). For each gene family, the P-value determined by the AU test for the consensus tree corresponds
to the probability of identifying the gene family as having
evolved according to the consensus (i.e., the null hypothesis is that the gene family evolved according to the consensus). When the SH test was applied to the
proteobacterial genomes without in silico transfers only
two significant conflicts (with a significance level of 5%)
with the assumed species phylogeny were reported [25].
We obtained similar results by applying the AU test to the
orthologous gene families from the gamma proteobacterial genomes (see Methods for the selection of gene families). The distribution of AU-values is presented in Figure
2A. Only two families out of 236 showed a conflict at the
significance level of 5 *10-4, 5 conflicts were found at the
significance level of 0,01 and 26 conflicts at the significance level of 0,05.

Two examples of in silico exchange of genes between two
species are shown on Figure 1. Histograms of the distribution of AU test values for all gene families for the two cases
of in silico gene exchange are presented on Figure 3. The
two transfers yield significant conflicts with very different
frequencies. In case of a gene exchange between Pseudomonas aeroginosa and Vibrio cholera only 12% of gene
families produced P-values less than 10-4 when compared
with the species tree. The power of detection increases
when the species undergoing the gene swap are separated
in the tree by a larger number of nodes. In case of the
exchange between Escherichia coli and Xylella fastidiosa the
number of families with significant conflict (P < 10-4) is
94 %. The power of detection for all possible pairwise
swaps with four different significant levels is summarized

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/45

in Figure 4. Tables showing exact detection levels and
reflecting the tree topology are included in the additional
files [Additional file 1].
In another series of experiments we simulated recent HGT
by donating a gene from one species to the other, as
depicted by the unidirectional arrow in Figure 1 designating transfer from Yersinia pestis KIM to Pasteurella multocida. The donated gene replaces the existing ortholog so
that the new dataset contains two identical sequences. We
simulated all possible gene donations to all species, and
for each compare the new tree with the reference tree. The
power of detection with four different significant levels is
presented in Figure 5. Tables showing exact detection levels and reflecting the tree topology are included in the
additional files [Additional file 1].
An advantage of the AU test is that its significance level
directly relates to the number of expected false positives
(i.e., the probability that a conflict is inferred in error due
to chance). However, the significance level does not consider systematic artifacts and biases generated in phylogenetic reconstruction. Furthermore, the significance level
does not inform the user on the number of false negatives.
The latter can be assessed through either simulations or in
silico transfers. Internal branches of a phylogenetic tree frequently are difficult to reconstruct with confidence. It is
therefore reasonable to assume that transfers and
exchanges between terminal branches of a phylogenetic
tree (that are separated by more than one node) are easier
to detect than transfers that occurred earlier in evolution.
Our use of in silico transfers thus likely under estimates the
number of false negatives encountered in the analyses of
real data; however, a verification of this expectation will
require simulation or in silico transfers that swap whole
clades, and not individual sequences only. For the experiments performed here on average, and excluding
exchanges between sister taxa, the AU test at a 5% level
detects 90,3% of the transfers and 91% of the exchanges
as significant. At a significance level of 10-4, which would
be more appropriate considering that multiple test are
performed (see below), the detection rate drops to 71 %
and 70% respectively. We conclude that an individual
gene family frequently does not contain sufficient phylogenetic information to detect HGT events reliably.
A disadvantage of the AU test with respect to HGT-detection is that it requires the knowledge of the organismal
tree that one usually doesn't have. The studies of Lerat et
al. [26], where the SH test were applied to only 5 possible
organismal trees, were extended to 105 not significantly
different "true" trees [30], and both, SH and AU tests were
applied. The number of rejected trees varies considerably
over the range of 105 trees, thus questioning the statement that the gamma proteobacterial core is free from

HGT. The choice of the "best" tree is still difficult because
all these trees are not significantly different from each
other (see discussion on the choice of the best tree in
[33]).
Symmetric difference of Robinson and Foulds
The Symmetric Difference of Robinson and Foulds [27]
between two trees gives the number of bipartitions that
are different in two trees, or the number of bipartitions or
splits that are in one tree and not in the other. The distribution of the symmetric difference values for the original
non-swapped data is depicted on Figure 2B.

We use the mean and standard deviation of the distance
distribution in the original data to assess the significance
of a distance after in silico transfer. We considered a distance to the consensus as significant, if this distance was at
least two standard deviations larger than the mean of the
distance distribution of the non-swapped original data. In
case of a normal distribution, this cutoff level corresponds
to a significance level of 2.5%. The results from all possible pairwise swaps are shown in Figure 6A, and the results
of all possible gene donations with replacement from one
species to another are shown on Figure 6B. Tables show-

This rather simple minded approach to evaluate the significance of the distance between two trees was surprisingly effective, but clearly inferior to the AU-test at
comparable significance levels. Ignoring transfers between
sister taxa on average 57.7% of the exchanges and 60% of
the donations were identified as significant conflicts. This
method could greatly be improved, if it were to consider
the support values of the bipartitions not shared between

the trees. This would make this approach more similar to
the Lento plot analysis (see below). One also could use
more complex distance measures. The latter approach was
implemented in [34] using a distance measure calculated
from the symmetric distance of Robinson and Foulds [27]
combined with the maximum agreement subtree [35].
Analysis of bipartition spectra
Bipartition spectra (also known as Lento plots) focus only
on bipartitions that have statistical support. Here we use
bootstrap support values calculated using maximum like-

Thirteen complete genomes from gamma-proteobacteria were downloaded from the ncbi ftp-site [50] on July 2005. All of the analyses reported
here were performed on the encoded protein sequences.

lihood trees. The majority of the gene families strongly
support eight bipartitions. We call these bipartitions
majority bipartitions. Bipartition analysis of the original
data showed that only very few gene families provide high
bootstrap support for bipartitions conflicting with the
majority bipartitions ([24], Figure 7 and Table 1). This
finding is in accord with previous analyses that suggested
that the 13 gamma proteobactrial genomes used in this
study contain only few gene families in significant conflict
with the consensus [25]).
The results for detection of in silico gene exchange between
species are depicted in Figure 8. Tables showing exact
detection levels and reflecting the tree topology are
included in the additional files [Additional file 3]. At the
70% bootstrap support level (Figure 8A), most in silico
transfers resulted in at least one conflict with one of the
majority bipartitions. This finding was unexpected,
because the eight plurality bipartitions correspond to an
unresolved tree including one node with eight emerging
branches [24]. However, only in case of the five sister species are the leaves not separated by at least one of the
bipartitions with majority support. The five instances of
sister species result in 5 genome pairs for which the power
of HGT detection using this approach is zero (purple arcs
in Figure 8): 1–8 (Buchnera aphidicola and Wigglesworthia
glossinidia), 2–6 (Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium), 3–4 (Haemophilus influenzae – Pasteurella multocida), 9–10 (Xanthomonas campestris and Xanthomonas
axonopodis) and 12–13 (Yersinia pestis KIM and Yersinia
pestis CO92) (see Figures 1 and 8). In all other instances
the power of detection was on average 97% using a 70%
cut-off for the conflicting bipartitions (Figure 8A). If the
cut-off level for conflicting bipartitions is increased to
90% (Figure 8B), the rate of detection drops to an average
of 94.2%, but overall, the level of detection compares
favorably to the one obtained with the AU test.

The experiment of gene donation with replacement for
bipartitions is quite time consuming: for each new tree
topology, resulting from a gene donation, one must generate and analyze 100 bootstrapped replicates, which on
the University of Connecticut's biocluster (PowerPC G5
2.3 GHz, 2GB RAM) using phyml takes about 20 minutes
for 100 bootstrap replicates; multiplying by 236 families
gives a computation time of about 3 days for one gene
donation experiment for one genome. For the set of 13
species, there are 13*12 = 156 possible donations, thus it
would take about 156*3 = 468 days of computational
time. However, a gene donation with replacement results
in two identical sequences being present in the dataset. It
is reasonable to assume that these two identical sequences
will form a highly supported group. We therefore estimate
the power of detection of the bipartition approach by
determining the number of majority bipartitions (Table 2
and Figure 7) that conflict with the bipartition created
through the gene transfer. The results of these comparisons are presented in Table 3. In our case the number of
conflict can range from 0 to 8, but even one conflict is sufficient to detect the conflict created through HGT. Only
the transfers between sister species evade detection
through the bipartition approach.
Organismal phylogeny
The phylogeny used as a reference tree (see Figure 1)
groups the two endosymbionts Buchnera aphidicola and
Wigglesworthia glossinidia together. The monophyly of
these and other insect endosymbionts was supported by
several studies that were based on analyses of the available
genome sequences [25,36,37]. However, the endosymbionts are characterized by reduced, AT rich genomes, and
the placement of these sequences thus might reflect
shared bias and not shared ancestry. It should be noted
that the analysis reported here, as well as the studies
reported in [25,36,37], used amino acid sequences; however, it is possible that the nucleotide bias might also
impact the amino acid based studies. A recent study based

Figure 7
"Lento"-plot [28] depicting the phylogenetic information retained in 13 Gamma proteobacterial genomes.
This plot is a modified summary of the analyses and results reported in [24]. The plot summarizes the phylogenies from protein
families that were determined to have putative orthologs in each of the 13 genomes using the reciprocal best hit criterion [47,
52]. 29 bipartitions (from a total of 4082) were found to be supported by at least one gene family with more than 70% bootstrap support. The bipartitions are ranked in order of the number of supporting families at the 70% bootstrap support level.
For each bipartition the bars in the positive direction give the number of gene families that support the bipartition with the
indicated (color coded) support value, the bars in the negative direction give the number of supported conflicting bipartitions
found in all of the gene families. This number can be greater than the number of gene families, because a single gene family can
support several conflicting bipartitions. Note that the first eight bipartitions are supported by the majority of gene families, and
that only three dataset conflict with these plurality bipartitions at the 99% bootstrap support level. See [24] for further discussion.

Power of HGT detection using bipartition spectra on genome data with in silico transfer
Power of HGT detection using bipartition spectra on genome data with in silico transfer. Power of detection is
calculated as the percentage of gene families that after an in silico transfer supported one or more bipartitions with more than
70% (panel A) or 90% (panel B) bootstrap support that were in conflict with one of the eight plurality bipartitions (see Table 2).
Each colored arc corresponds to one genome pair, and the percent of gene families with detected conflict is color coded.
on a non equilibrium model suggested that Buchnera and
Wigglesworthia might not be monophyletic [38]. This
study was based on a nucleotide sequence alignment of
only two gene families, but it included 8 endosymbiotic
gamma proteobacterial taxa. If the monophyly of Buchnera and Wigglesworthia were indeed an artifact due to
shared bias it would indicate that even high support values for protein based phylogenies between not very divergent organisms have to be regarded with more skepsis
than they usually receive. However, this finding would
not detract from the findings and the value of this study,
i.e., demonstrating that individual genes frequently contain too little information to decide between alternative
phylogenies.

Orthologous replacement versus "real" gene transfer
The use of phylogentic information to detect horizontally
transferred genes restricts analyses to families of
orthologs. In case of the 13 gamma proteobacterial
genomes used in the study the assembled families of
orthologs represents only about 7% of the studied
genomes. These families of orthologous proteins represent genes under strong purifying selection, which tend to
be transferred infrequently [1,39,40]. Most of the transferred genes identified through the comparison between
strains do not have recognizable orthologs in divergent
organisms; many of them, the so-called ORFans, do not
have homologs in the current databanks at all. These
genes are acquired from phage and plasmids, and not

Numbers give the percent of gene families that support the indicated consensus bipartitions with more than 70% bootstrap support, and the
number of gene families that support at least one conflicting bipartition with more than 70% bootstrap support. Bipartitions are indicated in the

directly from other genomes [6,7,41,42]. While gene families with recognizable orthologs do not represent the typical transferred gene, the rate of transfer for the conserved,
infrequently transferred genes is important, because these
genes are used to reconstruct organismal phylogenies, and
if transferred genes are not excluded from these analyses,
the resulting phylogenies might represent neither the phylogenies of an individual gene nor the history of the
organism [7].
Correction for multiple tests
The analyses presented in this study, and the reported significance values are based on the individual gene phylogeny only and do not include a correction for multiple
tests, as is the case in most phylogenetic analyses screening genome scale data for phylogenetic conflict (e.g.
[43,44]). In case of the AU tests, it is straight forward to
apply the Bonferoni correction [45], i.e., a significance
level of (alpha/(number of parallel tests)) for the individual test gives the probability (alpha) that a result of any of

the performed multiple tests might be considered significantly different due to error. Applying this correction
would lead to even fewer of the transferred genes being
detected. For an overall error probability of 5%, the individual test would need to apply a significance level of
.02% (5% divided by the number of gene families tested)
or 2*10-4 (compare Figures 4A, 4B, 5A, and 5B). In case of
the bipartition analyses a correction for multiple tests has
not been established. Bootstrap support values for a clade
provide a measure for the amount of information present
in the analyzed data supporting this clade. Bootstrap support values were shown to be more conservative than
probabilities (e.g., [46,47]). In a hypothesis testing framework, 100 minus % bootstrap support can be considered
as a measure for identifying the clade as monophyletic in
error (see [48] for a recent discussion). However, without
correction the resulting error probabilities are vastly overestimated. For example, the Lento plot depicted in Figure
7 shows that at most 10 datasets conflict with the majority
bipartitions with more than 70% support, and only five

families conflict with one of the plurality bipartitions with
more than 90% support. These numbers are far below the
70 (30% of the families) or 23 (10%) families that are
expected per bipartiton, if 100% bootstrap support were
equal to the error probability. Considering that at least
some of the conflicts are due to HGT, and that other systematic artifacts are likely to have increased incongruence
between individual gene phylogenies, the lack of conflict
is even more testament to the conservative nature of the
bootstrap support values.
Comparison of different approaches
The AU test provides a good statistical framework to assess
significance levels, i.e., the probability that a conclusion
of incongruence is made in error. However, in assessing
the phylogenies as a whole, many of the swapped or transferred genes evade detection. Using the fraction of
detected in silico transfers as measure, the bipartition
based analysis appears most successful in this test case;
however, this finding cannot be generalized (see discussion below). We do not know the "real" rate of false positives, however, the significance levels and the total
number of inferred transfers provide estimations and
upper bounds for the number of false positives, respectively. Bootstrap support values for an individual split
often are more conservative than probability estimates
[46-48]. Figure 7 and Table 2 illustrate that using bipartitions that are supported by 90 % the rate of false positives
over all bipartitions is less than 5/236 or 2.1%. (Only five
gene families, i.e. 2.1%, showed conflicts with the plurality bipartitions, and most of these families probably represent real instances of gene transfer. The 2.1% of gene
families with significant conflict thus provide an upper
bound, the case that all these conflicts were identified
erroneously, for the rate of false positives.) The success of
the bipartition based approach probably is due to its focus
on individual well supported bipartitions. In contrast, the
AU test assesses all splits in a tree simultaneously. This
might lead to changes in one part of the tree being masked
by uncertainty in other parts of the tree. It also could be
argued that the significance level in the AU test overestimates the false positive rate; for example the actual rate of
false positives in case of the AU test performed with a 5%
significance level might be much smaller than 5%. However, the data in Figure 2A suggest that the significance
level is a reasonable estimator of the false positive rate.

The advantage of the Lento plot based approach is that
gene transfer events can be detected even in the absence of
a completely resolved organismal phylogeny. However,
the power of detection of this approach depends on at
least a few well-supported bipartitions being present in
the majority of gene phylogenies. If such a majority signal
can be extracted from the individual gene phylogenies,
then the bipartition based approach can identify families

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/45

that are likely candidates for gene transfer. If only few
majority bipartitions are present in a bipartition spectrum, as is frequently the case in analyses of many
genomes and with phylogenies that contain short internal
branches, then the AU-test provides an alternative method
to identify individual conflicting genes, provided a reasonable hypothesis for the organismal phylogeny can be
developed. In case a reliable reference or consensus phylogeny is unavailable, other approaches that break down
gene phylogenies into smaller units of phylogenetic information, e.g., quartet decomposition [49], might provide
an alternative to the AU test.
The choice of method also is contingent on the reason
why one wants to identify putatively transferred genes. If
one is interested in case studies of transferred genes, then
the AU test with a high significance level, or a bipartition
spectrum both are effective in identifying candidate genes.
However, if one wants to remove gene families from a
genome based phylogenetic analyses that might taint a
combined dataset, then the AU test with a 5% significance
levels provides a workable solution, even though at this
significance level one expects to remove about 5% of the
gene families erroneously. Finally, at present none of the
available approaches appears entirely satisfying to quantify rates of orthologous replacement; one needs to balance unacceptable high rates of false negatives against the
reliability of assessing rates of false positive, and both
types of errors need to be explicitly considered in the
quantification.

Conclusion
The existing phylogenetic methods of HGT detection
should be treated with caution when attempting to estimate rates of transfer. The AU test provides a good measure of reliability with respect to false positives, but the rate
of false negatives was high when stringent significance levels were applied. Decreasing the significance level, as
expected, leads to a decrease in the false negative rate; with
a 5% significance level the power of detection was 90% on
average.
Bipartition spectra were surprisingly powerful in our test
case. Even at a cut-off level of 70% only ten conflicts were
detected in the original data, and many of these conflicts
apparently correspond to real gene transfers [24,25]. At
the lower cut-off level detection rates were better than
97% on average, and the rate of detection remained high,
even when the cut-off level was increased. However, this
success of the bipartition spectra cannot be generalized.
For the 13 gamma-proteobacteria used in this study we
have eight highly supported bipartitions, and most of the
tested in silico transfers cross at least one of these consensus bipartitions. The power of the bipartiton based

approach will decrease with the number of consensus
bipartitions.

Methods
Thirteen complete genomes from gamma-proteobacteria
were downloaded from the ncbi's ftp-site [50] on July
2005. All of the analyses reported here were performed on
the encoded protein sequences. The genomes used in this
study are listed in Table 1.
236 families of putatively orthologous genes were
detected using the strict reciprocal best Blast hit method
[46,47,51,52] with an E-value cutoff of 10-4. Gene families
were aligned with ClustalW version 1.83 [53] using
default parameters. Special treatment of regions with
ambiguous alignment was not necessary, because the
orthologous sequences, selected by the strict reciprocal
Blast hit method, were on average 61% identical with the
standard deviation of ± 18%. For each family a maximum
likelihood tree was calculated by Phyml [31] using the JTT
model, four relative substitution rate categories, and an
estimated gamma distribution parameter. The tree
depicted in Figure 1 was calculated as consensus tree from
the individual gene trees using the majority-rule consensus method with the program CONSENSE from the
Phylip package [32]. The same phylogeny was obtained
from a 16s RNA alignment using maximum likelihood as
implemented in Phyml [31] using the HKY model, estimation of invariant sites, and among site rate variation
described by a gamma distribution with estimated shape
parameter.

symmetrical difference for the gene trees with artificial
transfers and normalized the obtained values by the average value of symmetric difference of the original data
minus two standard deviations. For a signal generated
through HGT to be considered significant we required
that the normalized symmetric difference of the trees with
artificial swaps and the species trees was more than zero.
SPR distance was calculated with the Efficient Evaluation
of Edit Path (EEEP) algorithm [56].
Analysis of bipartition spectra
For each gene family tree, 100 bootstrapped trees were
generated and evaluated with the phyml program [31].
Bipartition tables were calculated from the individual
trees using the program CONSENSE of the Phylip package
[32]. We collected the highly supported bipartitions from
each of the 236 families in one dataset by filtering out all
bipartitions with bootstrap support values less than a
given threshold (70 or 90%). The method of HGT detection consists in finding those bipartitions that exhibit a
conflict with the consensus bipartition while having a
high bootstrap support value.

In silico transfers were performed by flipping the two
genomes in the original set of consensus bipartitions (see
Table 1) and these bipartitions were then compared for
compatibility with the bipartitions from the original gene
families. Compatibility between bipartitions was calculated using in house PERL script.

Authors' contributions
AU test
The p-values of the approximately unbiased test were calculated with the program Consel [54]. Log-likelihoods
were estimated with Codeml from the PAML package
[55]. The artificial swaps between genomes were simulated by changing places of the pair of genomes in multiple alignment files and in the reconstructed trees. Gene
donation events were simulated by replacing a recipient
genome sequence with a donor sequence in the alignment
file, so that alignment file contains two identical
sequences from the donor genome. The tree was modified
by moving the branch of the recipient genome next to the
donor genome. Each gene tree with simulated transfers
was compared against the organismal tree, and those
whose AU test value was less than a certain significance
level were considered as detected.
Symmetric difference of Robinson and Foulds
Symmetric difference of Robinson and Foulds was calculated with the program Treedist from the Phylip package
[32]. First we obtained a non-zero distribution for the
original data by calculating symmetric difference for each
gene tree and consensus species tree. Then we calculated
