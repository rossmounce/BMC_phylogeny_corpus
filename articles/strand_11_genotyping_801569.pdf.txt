Genotyping of black grouse MHC class II B using
reference Strand-Mediated Conformational
Analysis (RSCA)
Tanja M Strand* and Jacob Höglund

Abstract
Background: The Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) is a cluster of genes involved in the vertebrate immune
system and includes loci with an extraordinary number of alleles. Due to the complex evolution of MHC genes,
alleles from different loci within the same MHC class can be very similar and therefore difficult to assign to
separate loci. Consequently, single locus amplification of MHC genes is hard to carry out in species with recently
duplicated genes in the same MHC class, and multiple MHC loci have to be genotyped simultaneously. Since
amplified alleles have the same length, accurate genotyping is difficult. Reference Strand-Mediated Conformational
Analysis (RSCA), which is increasingly used in studies of natural populations with multiple MHC genes, is a
genotyping method capable to provide high resolution and accuracy in such cases.
Findings: We adapted the RSCA method to genotype multiple MHC class II B (BLB) genes in black grouse (Tetrao
tetrix), a non-model galliform bird species, using a 96-Capillary Array Electrophoresis, the MegaBACE™ 1000 DNA
Analysing System (GE Healthcare). In this study we used fluorescently labelled reference strands from both black
grouse and hazel grouse and observed good agreement between RSCA and cloning/sequencing since 71 alleles
were observed by cloning/sequencing and 76 alleles by RSCA among the 24 individuals included in the comparison.
At the individual level however, there was a trend towards more alleles scored with RSCA (1-6 per individual) than
cloning/sequencing (1-4 per individual). In 63% of the pair-wise comparison, the identical allele was scored in RSCA
as in cloning/sequencing. Nine out of 24 individuals had the same number of alleles in RSCA as in cloning/
sequencing. Our RSCA protocol allows a faster RSCA genotyping than presented in many other RSCA studies.
Conclusions: In this study, we have developed the RSCA typing method further to work on a 96-Capillary Array
Electrophoresis (MegaBACE™ 1000). Our RSCA protocol can be applied to fast and reliable screening of MHC class
II B diversity of black grouse populations. This will facilitate future large-scale population studies of black grouse
and other galliformes species with multiple inseparable MHC loci.

Background
In vertebrates, MHC (Major Histocompatibility Complex)
is a cluster of highly variable genes that plays an important
role in the immune defence and which may evolve
through different forms of balancing selection [1-4]. This
multigene family is highly interesting from an evolutionary
perspective. For example, MHC genes have been associated with individual fitness, population viability and evolutionary potential in changing environments [2]. MHC

genes are in fact among the most suitable candidates for
studies of adaptive genetic diversity because of the numerous associations found between MHC genotypes and
pathogen resistance e.g. [5-9]. In studies of both model
and non-model species, the interest in MHC genes has
remained high among evolutionary biologists over decades. However, large-scale studies of natural populations
are hampered because of the complexity working with
MHC genes.
MHC evolution is characterized by repeated gene
duplication (birth) and gene loss (death), thereby loci
evolve under a birth-and-death model [10]. Supplementary to the birth-and-death model of MHC evolution is

concerted evolution, observed particularly in birds
[11,12]. This is the result of frequent genetic exchange
between duplicated genes by recombination or gene conversion (i.e. interlocus genetic exchange). Because of the
complicated (and not fully understood) evolution of
MHC genes there are pronounced differences in the
genomic organization and number of the MHC loci
between vertebrate lineages [13], especially between
mammalian and non-mammalian species [12,14]. For this
reason it is a great challenge to accurately amplify MHC
genes in non-model species. For example, the number of
MHC loci can vary extensively between different species,
even when the species compared are phylogenetically
related and belong to the same taxonomic family, like
chicken and quail [15]. There are also known or assumed
cases of MHC copy number variation within species
[16-21]. Additionally, in non-mammalian species with
multiple loci per MHC class, the loci belonging to the
same MHC class are, in most species, too similar to tell
apart [16,22-25]. Designing primers that amplify a single
MHC locus is therefore a difficult task. In combination
with PCR artefacts [26] and the common presence of
pseudogenes in MHC, this also makes single locus amplification of functional MHC alleles hard to accomplish.
Consequently, many MHC studies in non-mammalian
species are struggling with genotyping PCR products
including more than two MHC alleles.
For PCR products from multiple MHC loci, existing
genotyping methods, like cloning and Sanger sequencing,
Reference Strand-Mediated Conformational Analysis
(RSCA), Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism
(SSCP), Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE)
and Next Generation amplicon sequencing, work with different levels of accuracy, precision and speed [27-29].
RSCA, DGGE and SSCP all are methods that have the
potential to separate PCR products that have the same
length but differ in DNA sequence. PAGE-SSCP (gelbased SSCP) is a widely used MHC typing method that
can separate alleles that only differ in one base-pair
because of the different conformation of the alleles [30].
The method has earlier been modified for use on automated sequencers [31] and recently also for capillary electrophoresis, CE-SSCP [32]. In contrast, DGGE has not, to
our knowledge, been adapted to automated sequencers
[33]. This technique is based on the principle that doublestranded DNA molecules have unique denaturation rates
that are based on the specific nucleotide composition.
RSCA [34] is a genotyping method increasingly used in
studies of mammalian MHC but recently also in the Seychelles warbler [35], red jungle fowl [36], peacock [37],
stickleback [28] and lake trout [38]. In RSCA, a fluorescently labelled reference DNA fragment is generated by
PCR and hybridised with the PCR products of the samples to be tested (“test alleles”). A duplex is formed

Page 2 of 11

containing loops and bulges corresponding to the number and position of base pair mismatches between the
fluorescent labelled reference strand (FLR) and each test
strand [34]. When electrophoresis is run through a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, each different duplex
formed will migrate slightly differently. In a laser detection system, the relative positions of the fluorescent
duplexes are shown as different peaks in an electropherogram, two peaks per heterozygote individual and a single
peak for a homozygote if amplifying a single locus. Each
allele will have a specific migration value (peak) in the
electropherogram when run with a specific FLR, and running each allele with several different FLRs enables differentiation between highly similar alleles. Each individual is
therefore RSCA genotyped with a number of different
FLRs. For examples of RSCA electropherograms, see
Figure 1. To be able to identify known or new alleles
from the peaks (migration values), a RSCA library is first
constructed with the migration values from each known
allele (see below). The superior advantage of RSCA compared to SSCP and DGGE is the usage of multiple FLRs
that minimizes problems with co-migration of alleles.
Although time-consuming, RSCA methods where preparation of acrylamide gels are required, is still widely
used for MHC genotyping such as ALFexpress [39-43]
and on ABI377 [44-46]. RSCA has also been optimised to
various Capillary Electrophoresis (CE) instruments, firstly
to the one capillary instrument ABI PRISM 310 (Applied
Biosystems) [47,48]. Recently, besides CE instruments,
also Capillary Array Electrophoresis (CAE) instruments,
with several capillaries for faster genotyping, are used in
RSCA typing, four capillaries in CAE ABI 3130 [28,49]
and 16 capillaries in CAE ABI 3100 [21,28,36,50,51]. To
our knowledge, RSCA genotyping has not previously
been optimised for a MegaBACE™ instrument (GE
Healthcare). RSCA on MegaBACE™ may work differently than RSCA on ABI because of the many differences
between the systems. The dissimilarities between MegaBACE™ and ABI includes “the mechanism by which
sample DNA is introduced into the capillaries, the capillaries themselves, i.e., capillary diameter, length, and
internal coating, the mechanism of excitation (although
both use laser-induced fluorescence), where the DNA is
detected and the method of detection itself” [52].
The black grouse (Tetrao tetrix) has a well-studied
complex mating system where males defend territories at
traditional leks (mating grounds) which females visit to
mate (Höglund and Alatalo 1995). Also, the black grouse
is a wide-spread bird with both viable and threatened
populations and MHC studies can, for example, clarify
the role and importance of MHC diversity in conservation. In an earlier study [25] we amplified and sequenced
transcribed MHC class II B alleles in black grouse, but
before we can continue with large-scale studies of MHC

variation, we wanted to design an efficient and reliable
MHC genotyping method suitable for black grouse.
The objective of this study was to develop an RSCA
approach further, for even higher throughput MHC genotyping on a 96-Capillary Array Electrophoresis (the MegaBACE™ 1000, an instrument not previously used for
RSCA) in general, and more specifically, for MHC genotyping in black grouse. Such a method could facilitate
large-scale surveys of MHC genetic polymorphism in both
model and non-model species. To verify the method we
compared the RSCA typing results with cloning and classic Sanger sequencing. In our study, we successfully genotyped black grouse MHC class II B alleles from expressed
loci using RSCA. When we compared cloning/sequencing
with RSCA, most black grouse alleles were detected with
both methods. There is however a tendency for higher
number of MHC alleles typed with RSCA than cloning/
sequencing. We therefore suggest that our RSCA genotyping protocol is not primarily suitable for individual level
studies of MHC diversity where allele-specific correlations
are sought for, but it is appropriate for large-scale studies
of MHC diversity on the population level.

Results
Amplification of MHC BLB

The primer pair RNAF1a (5’GACAGCGAAGTGGGGAAATA-3’) and RNAR1a (5’- CGCTCCTCTGCAC
CGTGA-3’) was used to amplify a 125 bp fragment of the
BLB exon 2 in all following PCR protocols. We designed
these primers in conserved regions of the exon 2 for our
previous study and have shown that they specifically
amplify functional BLB but not YLB alleles [25]. We
assume that this primer pair is capable of amplifying a
wide range of different BLB alleles, as it amplifies the BLB
as well in two related grouse species, the hazel grouse and
the willow grouse (Bonasa bonasia and Lagopus lagopus,
unpublished data).
RSCA establishment
FLR selection

Ideally, the alleles chosen to be FLRs should neither be
too different nor too similar to the alleles genotyped
(“test alleles”) in the study [50]. If the FLR and the test
allele are too different, they may not hybridise. On the
other hand, if the FLR and the test allele are too similar,

Strand and Höglund BMC Research Notes 2011, 4:183
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/4/183

the homoduplex formation of the FLR and the heteroduplex formation between the FLR strand and the test
allele strand will co-migrate in the gel and the test allele
will therefore become undetected. Co-migration can
also happen when a FLR strand is hybridised with a test
allele strand, if the hybridisation produces a formation
that has similar migration speed as another test allele.
One way to avoid co-migration and therefore avoid
undetected alleles is to use more than one FLR. The
risk of co-migration with the homoduplex is also
decreased if the FLRs are chosen from a related species
instead of the same species, since shared alleles between
different species are presumably rare.
In this study, we used one allele from black grouse
and three alleles from a species from the same subfamily
(Tetraoninae), the hazel grouse [53], giving a total of
four FLRs. The first allele cloned and sequenced from
our previous study [25], Tete BLB01, was assigned FLRTete1. We tested the remaining black grouse alleles,
Tete BLB02-09, as FLRs and most of them resulted in
distinguishable peaks in the electropherogram. However,
we decided to use FLRs from the hazel grouse, to reduce
the risk of undetected test-alleles identical to the allele
that the FLR is based on. Using hazel grouse alleles
minimizes this risk since black grouse and hazel grouse
probably do not share alleles (although possible due to
trans-species polymorphism). MHC class II B alleles
were amplified from one hazel grouse individual (cloned
twice) using the same primers (RNA F 1a and RNA R
1a), PCR-protocol and master cycler program as for the
black grouse BLB (see [25]). The PCR-product was
ligated into pCR4-TOPO vector using a Topo TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the
protocol by the manufacturer. Twenty colonies were
both forward and reverse sequenced on MegaBACE™
1000 DNA Analysis System (GE Healthcare, Uppsala,
Sweden). The resulting three unique hazel grouse
sequences were all chosen for FLRs. Allele Bobo BLB01
was assigned FLR-Bobo1, Bobo BLB02 FLR-Bobo2 and
Bobo BLB03 FLR-Bobo3. GenBank accession numbers
are GQ851943 for Bobo BLB01, GQ851944 for Bobo
BLB02 and GQ851945 for Bobo BLB03.
FLR amplification

We constructed a FAM-fluorescently labelled forward
primer FAM RNAF1a and used the normal non-labelled
reverse-primer RNAR1a for the FLR PCR on the above
clones for FLR-Tete1, FLR-Bobo1, FLR-Bobo2 and FLRBobo3. We used ten times as much of the labelled primer than the non-labelled one, to increase the heights
of the heteroduplex peaks in the electropherogram [21].
Approximately 50 ng DNA, 0.5 μM of the FAM forward
primer, 0.05 μM of the reverse primer, 0.6mM of dNTP,
3 mM MgCl2, 1 x buffer and 0.75 units BioTaq polymerase (DNA Technology, Aarhus, Denmark) were used

Page 4 of 11

in the 100 μl FLR PCR reaction. The reaction was
initiated at 94°C for 1 minute and was then run for 35
cycles at 94ºC for 1 minute and 30 seconds at both
64.9ºC and 72ºC before a stop for 10 minutes on 72°C.
The PCR products were purified with Montage PCR
spin columns (Millipore Cooperation, MA, USA), dissolved in TE buffer of pH 7 and stored at -20°C.
Construction of RSCA library

We first constructed a preliminary RSCA library with
eight unique BLB sequences from our previous study
[25]. The following PCR was performed on these eight
clones. Approximately 50 ng DNA, 0.48 μM of each primer, 0.6mM of dNTP, 3 mM MgCl 2 , 1 x buffer and
0.75 units BioTaq polymerase (DNA Technology, Aarhus, Denmark) were used in a 25 μl PCR reaction. The
reaction was initiated at 94°C for 1 minute and was then
run for 30 cycles at 94ºC for 1 minute and 30 seconds at
both 64.9ºC and 72ºC before a stop for 10 minutes on
72°C. The four FLRs were run with each of these original eight unique sequences (i.e. clones representing
alleles Tete BLB01-BLB09 but not BLB08 since that
allele may be an artefact) between four and nine times
(mean 6.2 times) in independent runs, using different
non-denatured polymer lots. Standard deviations (SD)
for migrations values were calculated for each FLR using
several runs. Between RSCA runs, the MegaBACE™ was
run with denaturing polymer for microsatellite genotyping or sequencing using the same capillaries. The homoduplex FLR peak always had a migration value of about
161 bp, close to the size of the amplified part of exon 2
including primers. All RSCA peaks turned up to the
right of the FLR peak (Figure 1). When we started to
screen MHC alleles in a population study of black
grouse (Strand et al. manuscript) using this RSCA
library, we noticed new RSCA peaks so we cloned more
individuals and increased the library with eight additional unique MHC class II B sequences. This updated
RSCA library is based on 16 cloned MHC class II B
sequences/alleles in total (additional file 1: RSCA
library). One RSCA peak is visible for each unique allele
in both FLR-Tete1 and FLR-Bobo1. FLR-Bobo2 shows
two peaks (one additional or one alternative peak)
instead of one peak for five alleles, and three peaks for
one allele. One allele run with FLR-Bobo3 also shows an
extra peak.
RSCA genotyping

To compare RSCA typing with cloning and Sanger
sequencing, we typed and scored the RSCA for individuals previously cloned in Strand et al. 2007 [25] and
Strand et al. manuscript, using the RSCA library (additional file 1: RSCA library). After genotyping RSCA in
MegaBACE™ 1000, we viewed our electropherograms
in the software MegaBACE Fragment Profiler™ version

1.2 (GE Healthcare) and assigned possible alleles (see
Figure 1 and Table 1 for an example) for each FLR
using the RSCA library and scoring rules.
The scoring rules were performed as follows:
1) A peak was scored as a certain allele if it were
present in the migration value range of that allele
(additional file 1: RSCA library) in four out of the
four FLRs.
2) It is enough to score an allele as present if it
exists in three FLRs if that allele is single in one
strong peak (this means that no other allele has the
same migration value in that FLR, for an example
see allele 5 in migration value 184.8 in FLR-Bobo3,
Table 1).
Exceptions to these rules exist for allele BLB01 since
this allele is the basis for FLR-Tete1 (they are identical).
FLR-Tete1 can therefore not have a peak for BLB01. In
case BLB01, three FLRs is therefore enough for scoring
in the first rule, and two FLRs is enough for scoring in
the second rule.
Individuals present in the comparison between RSCA
and cloning (Table 2) must first pass the two following
criterions. First, at least 20 randomly chosen clones
must have been picked per individual PCR. We
sequenced 16-35 clones per individual (i.e. clones that
had inserts of the right size, Table 2), Second, the
reported MHC sequences must have been found in at
least one other cloning of a different PCR reaction (in
MHC studies, generally only alleles present in two independent PCR reactions are regarded as confirmed [27]).
A typical example of scoring is presented for individual Ref 26. The electropherograms for Ref 26 for all
four FLRs is visible in Figure 1. The leftmost blue peak
at migration value of approx. 161 is the homoduplex
peak for the FLR so that peak is always disregarded.
One FLR show three RSCA peaks, one show four RSCA
peaks and two show five RSCA peaks. Each RSCA peak
lays in a certain migration value range for a specific
MHC allele, as reported in Table 1.

In certain cases there are two or even three RSCA
peaks in the same FLR for the same allele (probably
because more than one formation is stable between the
FLR and the allele), resulting in two (or three) migration
value ranges within the same FLR for one allele (additional file 1: RSCA library). In the example in Table 1,
alleles with an apostrophe (’) reflect a second or alternative RSCA peak. Following the scoring rules (in the
paragraph above) on Table 1, Ref 26 has allele BLB22
according to rule 1, allele BLB05 according to both rule
1 and rule 2, and BLB01 according to rule 2 (and rule 1
applying the exception for BLB01). This individual thus
has three MHC alleles, namely BLB01, BLB05 and
BLB22 according to RSCA. Cloning and sequencing also
revealed these MHC alleles (28 clones sequenced).
There are peaks present in the electropherogram (Figure
1, Table 1) that were not scored as alleles (181.9 (FLRTete1), 170.6 (FLR-Bobo1) and 177.1 (FLR-Bobo2)).
Two of these peaks (181.9 (FLR-Tete1) and 177.1 (FLRBobo2)) are actually peaks within much larger peaks
and could therefore be artefacts. The other peak (170.6
(FLR-Bobo1)) could represent an additional folding
structure that may appear for example when alleles are
hybridised with the FLR (because the sequences can
match in more than one way) or due to either non-optimal hybridisation temperatures or MegaBACE run temperatures. This peak could simply also represent an
unknown allele.
Comparison between cloning/sequencing and RSCA

The mean number of alleles typed per individual was
2.96 (SD 0.95) with cloning and 3.17 (SD 1.40) with
RSCA among the 24 individuals but there were no significant difference in number of scored alleles (76 for
RSCA, 71 for cloning, Table 2) (paired Wilcoxon signed
rank test, df = 47.5, p = 0.487). Cloning and RSCA gave
equivalent results in the majority of pair-wise comparisons for each allele scored with either of the two methods. With pair-wise we mean pairs between each allele
(in all 24 individuals) observed in cloning and in RSCA,
and we had 90 such pairs in our comparison (Table 2).
In 57 out of 90 pair-wise comparisons, the same allele

The two methods of cloning/sequencing and RSCA for scoring MHC class II B
in black were compared. The table shows the different alleles “Alleles by seq”
and number of alleles per individual “N alleles”. The numbers below the
columns named “Alleles by seq” refers to confirmed Tete BLB alleles. “N
clones” refers to the number of clones sequenced per individual. Black grouse
named “Ref” where sampled in England, “Ne36” from Netherlands, and had
their DNA extracted from moulted feathers. Individual 10222 was sampled in
Norway and the DNA was extracted from muscle. For the remaining (Finnish)
samples, DNA was extracted from blood. 71 alleles were found by cloning and
76 by RSCA. 2.96 alleles (SD 0.95) were obtained in cloning, and 3.17 alleles
(SD 1.40) in RSCA.

was scored in RSCA as in cloning. In 15 out of these 90
cases, an allele was observed in cloning but not in
RSCA. Conversely, in 18 cases an allele was only
observed in RSCA. The nucleotide sequence of Tete
BLB02 deviates from Tete BLB01 with only one base
pair (in the 163 base pair long fragment) but could still
be distinguished in some individuals using RSCA. In
three individuals, Tete BLB02 is only found using RSCA
but not in cloning. In two other individuals, the same
allele Tete BLB02 is found only in cloning. In three

Discussion
RSCA has been increasingly used as a MHC genotyping
method in birds [35-37] and we have now further developed the RSCA typing method to operate on a 96-capillary array electrophoresis, providing a higher throughput.
To our knowledge, this is the first time RSCA have been
optimised to be run on the MegaBACE™ 1000 DNA
Analysing System. We have now designed a genotyping
method suitable for functional MHC class II B loci in
black grouse. This method performs well on DNA
extracted from both blood and moulted feathers. In the
present study, when comparing cloning and classic Sanger sequencing with RSCA, most black grouse MHC
class II B alleles are detected with both methods. Among
the 24 individuals, 71 alleles were found by cloning/
sequencing and 76 were found by RSCA. Some of the
MHC class II B alleles are found only by cloning/sequencing but not with RSCA and vice versa. There is also a
tendency for RSCA to score more alleles than cloning (14 alleles are observed per individual via cloning and 1-6
via RSCA) but whether RSCA overestimates or cloning
underestimates number of alleles is not yet clarified.
There are several possible reasons for the observed discrepancies between RSCA and cloning.
The first reason to the discrepancies at the individual
level may be that not enough clones were sequenced in
the cloning. Alleles that are not amplified to the same
extent as other alleles in the PCR due to non-optimal

Overall, comparing cloning and RSCA, discrepancies
exists, but in both directions. However, RSCA may
score more alleles than cloning (Figure 2). By cloning
and sequencing, 1-4 alleles per individual are observed,
and by RSCA, 1-6 alleles are scored per individual.

primer binding will fail to be found in cloning if not
very many clones are sequenced. To test this, many
more clones per individual than we used need to be
picked and sequenced. In our lab, fosmid sequencing
across MHC genes in one black grouse individual has
uncovered two MHC class II loci (BLB1 and BLB2) (B.
Wang et al., in preparation), suggesting that a maximum
of four MHC class II alleles can be present in black
grouse. This is in line with the maximum of four alleles
we observed in cloning. Our RSCA may thus overestimate number of alleles. However, at present we cannot
rule out the possibility of copy number variations in
MHC class II B in black grouse. Copy number variation
in MHC has been observed in several species [18,19],
including chicken where some individuals possess two
BLB (BLB1 and BLB2) loci and other individuals three
BLB loci [20]. BLB1 and BLB2 are possibly old duplications since they are positioned on either side of TAPB
and are present also in turkey, which possesses a third
BLB loci adjacent to BLB2 [20,54]. Copy number variation between one, two and three loci may explain the
range of 1-6 RSCA alleles per individual. It is also possible that an individual can possess only one BLB allele in
total even if black grouse possess between two and three
BLB loci. It has been shown in other galliformes (red
jungle fowl and pheasant) that identical MHC alleles
can be present at different loci [36,55], so one allele is
possible for a bird homozygous at two loci. We are
attempting to elucidate a possible presence of copy
number variation in an on-going MHC study.
The second reason for the observed discrepancies
between RSCA and cloning/sequencing at the individual
level may be non-optimal RSCA conditions. To minimize alternative folding structures RSCA run temperatures and hybridisation temperatures could have been
tested for each FLR individually. Also, more FLRs could
have been added to providing better resolution of alleles,
but at the price of being time- and resource consuming.
Our result of the comparison between cloning/sequencing and RSCA is almost identical to a study of the
domestic cat [21]. Using four FLRs we identified on
average 2.96 alleles (range 1-4) via cloning and 3.17
alleles (range 1-6) via RSCA. In the feline study, using
five FLRs, they found 3.0 alleles (range 1-4) by cloning
and 3.9 (range 2-6) by RSCA. Copy number variation
was found were some individuals carried two MHC
class II DRB genes and some three, explaining the range
from two to six DRB alleles per individuals (with
RSCA). The allele range in black grouse could also be
explained by similar copy number variation, as suggested above. Further, the feline study suggest that the
deviations in allele number between the two methods
could be the result of too strict rules for confirming an
allele, (that were followed to disregard PCR artefacts)

Page 7 of 11

i.e. two independent PCR/cloning reactions. Paradoxically, another reason suggested for the deviations
between the methods may be due to sequences that
represent PCR artefacts. All this highlight the drawbacks of cloning and Sanger sequencing and the complexity of characterizing MHC variability.
The MHC study by Lenz et al. 2009 [28] comparing
RSCA and cloning/sequencing found an even stronger
congruence than we found between the methods. It is
difficult to disentangle the reason for this since our
study differs from Lenz et al. in many ways, for example
in the selection of FLRs, the DNA quality, the run temperature and in the use of different electrophoresis
instrument.
Since we cannot rule out that our RSCA genotyping
protocol may overestimate the number of alleles, it may
not yet be optimal for individual level studies where
allele-specific correlations are sought for. Nevertheless,
we believe that our RSCA protocol is ideal for fast and
cheap population level studies of MHC diversity in
black grouse and related species.
A future possibility is to multiplex the RSCA, using
unique dyes for each FLR so that the different FLRs can
be run in the same capillary, increasing by a factor three
the speed of throughput. In this study, we used one
black grouse FLR and three hazel grouse FLRs to successfully genotype black grouse MHC class II B. This
leads us to believe that the protocol presented in this
paper can directly work to genotype MHC class II B in
other galliform species. At present, we are testing this
hypothesis by performing RSCA with black grouse FLRs
in hazel grouse and willow grouse, and preliminary
results are indeed positive. We want to point out that
for these newer studies we use non-denaturing matrix
(for the MegaBACE™) from Genomac International
(Prague) successfully. The RSCA can be adapted to
other loci but MHC and should be of great use since it
has the potential of separating any complex same-length
sequences.
In a number of recent studies, genotyping of MHC is
still performed solely by cloning and Sanger sequencing
e.g. [56-58]. Cloning and sequencing of MHC alleles
does not need optimization once the primers amplify
the right region, however, we see two major drawbacks
with this method. First, different types of artefacts can
lead to false identification of true alleles, namely PCR
artefacts (Taq errors, chimeras and heteroduplex formation in the last PCR cycle) and mismatch repair during
cloning [26]. In RSCA, the number of artefacts is
reduced since the PCR product is denatured before
screening and thus heteroduplex formations are neutralized [26]. The second drawback with cloning and Sanger sequencing is that alleles at low frequency in the
PCR can fail to be observed. The reason for this is when

Strand and Höglund BMC Research Notes 2011, 4:183
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/4/183

amplifying several MHC alleles simultaneously, all alleles
may not be amplified to an equal concentration if the
primers amplify certain alleles better than others. If this
is the case, alleles can be missed in cloning, because
many clones have to be picked to certify that all alleles
are identified. In RSCA, the lower concentration alleles
may have a better chance of being identified than in
cloning, since only the height of the RSCA peak is lower
than the other peaks if concentration is lower. In a
recent study using RSCA, RSCA was in fact not the
main genotyping method but were used to confirm
MHC alleles obtained from sequencing [59].
When alleles from multiple loci co-amplify in the
PCR, as the case for this black grouse study and many
other studies, accurate genotyping can be very challenging. The reason for this is because gels and chromatograms become difficult to interpret since bands or peaks
representing various alleles may overlap due to similar
mobility. This is the case for PAGE-SSCP, CE-SSCP and
DGGE. This problem is solved in RSCA since each sample is hybridised with several FLRs, so that alleles
migrate differently with different FLRs, leading to a
higher resolution. Recently, CE-SSCP has also been
modified to discriminate alleles better than before by
the use of overlapping PCR amplicons [60]. Other
advantages in RSCA over PAGE-SSCP and DGGE are
that the amount of toxic steps is greatly reduced as well
as the labour since no handling of gels is needed. In theory, an advantage of both DGGE and PAGE-SSCP compared to RSCA, is the possibility of excising bands from
the gels, reamplify and perform direct sequencing of
new MHC alleles. For this to work, the bands have to
be clearly separated in the gel. However, if sequences
are needed in RSCA the procedure of classic cloning
and sequencing can be greatly reduced by running
RSCA on the clones. That is, samples that show new
RSCA peaks can be cloned, and the clones can then be
hybridised with an FLR and run through RSCA to identify the specific clone containing the new alleles. This
procedure makes sequencing much cheaper since only
clones including the new allele need to be sequenced.
For further comparisons of the SSCP, DGGE and RSCA
methods, see [27,28].
Next generation amplicon sequencing techniques has
been increasingly used for MHC typing [29,61,62]. 454
amplicon sequencing, with individual tagging of PCR
primers, seem to be a reasonable choice for highly variable multilocus MHC genotyping when other, more
widely used methods, are not successful [27]. The major
drawback with 454 amplicon sequencing seems to be
the difficulties in distinguishing true alleles from artefact
sequences, that exist in higher number than Sanger
sequencing errors [29]. However, the large number of

Page 8 of 11

reads from pyrosequencing would allow for correction
of typing errors [29].
In the context of population genetics, the purpose of
MHC genotyping can roughly be divided into two different groups based on the level of precision. The first
group may be referred to as “sequence level MHC genotyping” and the other group as “population level MHC
genotyping”. “Sequence level MHC genotyping” is necessary when MHC sequences from individuals are studied,
to test for various forms of selection using patterns of
nucleotide and gene diversity or to find allele specific
mate choice or disease associations. On the other hand,
“population level MHC genotyping” is ideal for nonmodel species studies when a simpler MHC genotyping
method is being sought for. This might be the case in
conservation genetic studies of adaptive genetic diversity, for example to identify populations vulnerable to
changes in the environment. In “population level MHC
genotyping” there is no per se need to know the details
about nucleotide differences among the present alleles
so no sequencing needs to be performed in the screening process.
We believe that RSCA has a great potential for “population level MHC genotyping” and is of good value even
for “sequence level MHC genotyping”. RFLP (Restriction
Fragment Length Polymorphism) is a solid technique
but involves gel preparations and radioactive work and
is not as accurate as RSCA. RFLP cannot be used for
“sequence level MHC genotyping” at a later stage. We
suggest therefore that RSCA is a great first step in
MHC studies in non-model species, where the level of
detail and precision can be easily turned from “population level MHC genotyping” to “sequence level MHC
genotyping” with the same method.

Conclusions
In this study, we have developed a RSCA typing protocol for black grouse populations on a MegaBACE™
1000 DNA Analysing System. We hybridised each PCR
product with four different Fluorescently Labelled
References in individual wells and separated them by
electrophoresis. RSCA seems to be comparable at
separating black grouse MHC class II B alleles as cloning and Sanger sequencing since we found 76 alleles
by RSCA and 71 by cloning/sequencing among 24
individuals. There is however a tendency for RSCA to
score more alleles than cloning at the individual level.
Therefore, RSCA seems to be a promising method for
studies when a simpler MHC genotyping method is
being sought, for example, in conservation genetic studies for adaptive genetic diversity. Our study will also
facilitate large scale MHC studies in species other than
black grouse.

Methods
Study animal, samples and DNA extraction
The black grouse

Black grouse belong to the same order, Galliformes, and
family, Phasianidae, as chicken [53]. The lekking black
grouse is a species tied to taiga forest habitats. The females
mate with only one male and the males do not provide any
parental care [63]. In an earlier study [25] we showed that
MHC class II B (BLB) and Y (YLB) are orthologous in
chicken and black grouse and this finding was one of first
examples of orthology in the avian MHC [9]. Black grouse
and chicken possess approximately two to three BLB
genes and two YLB genes. The BLB genes are more
diverse and expressed than YLB genes [25]. 17 of the individuals used in this study were captured between 1989
and 2004 at study sites around Jyväskylä in central Finland
(see [64] for a description of the study area). Black grouse
were caught in winter flocks or when lekking and c. 1 ml
blood samples were drawn from the brachial wing vein
with a syringe using a heparinized needle. Red blood cells
were separated from plasma by centrifuging at 12000 rpm
for 5 min, and stored at 75% alcohol at +4°C until DNAextraction. Older blood samples (before 1990) were kept
frozen until DNA was isolated. Feathers from six other
individuals (named “Ref” and “Ne36” in Table 2) were collected in North Pennines (England) and Netherlands. The
moulted feathers were stored dry at room temperature for
1-20 months until DNA extraction. One sample (10222)
was sampled in Norway and the tissue type is muscle. For
blood, genomic DNA was extracted mainly using a standard phenol-chloroform procedure [65], but salt extraction [66] was also used. Genomic DNA from feathers and
muscle was extracted using DNeasy Tissue kit as described
in [67]. Birds that were caught, hunted or released were
done so under the permission, legislation and guidance of
the relevant authorities of the country of origin.
Hybridisation

PCR were performed as described under the section
“Construction of RSCA library”. For production of FLRs,
see the section “FLR amplification” in the result part.
For individuals, 3.0 µl of PCR product was mixed with
2.0 µl of FLR and for clones 2.0 µl of PCR product was
mixed with 2.0 µl FLR. The ratio between FLR and PCR
product was optimised for each FLR, so FLRs were
diluted individually. The hybridisation was performed
using a PCR thermo cycler starting with denaturation at
95°C for 10 min, and then cooling by 1°C/s until 55,
then heteroduplex formed for 15 min at 55°C until a
cooling step at 4°C for 15 min. The heteroduplex product was then stored at 4°C.
Capillary array electrophoresis

The hybridisation product was mixed with 4.0 µl cold
ddH2O. 2.0 µl of the diluted heteroduplex product was

Page 9 of 11

then mixed with 0.45 µl ET400R-Size standard (GE
Healthcare) and 7.55 µl ddH2O. The capillary array electrophoresis was performed on MegaBACE™ 1000 DNA
Analysing System (GE Healthcare). First, samples were
preinjected to remove excess salt and next, the capillaries
were rinsed. Thereafter, capillaries were filled with 3%
non-denaturing Long-Read-Matrix (polymer) (GE Healthcare) under high pressure. Lastly, 96 samples were injected
at 3 kV for 45 seconds and run for 60 min at 30°C and 10
kV. During the typing period, the capillaries were used
either for sequencing or microsatellite genotyping when
not used for RSCA, so we alternated between non-denaturing matrix and denaturing matrix.
Data analysis

MegaBACE fragment profiler™ version 1.2 was used to
analyse the RSCA peaks. CodonCode Aligner version
2.06 was used to identify the new sequences. The difference in number of alleles in RSCA versus cloning and
sequencing were tested in a paired Wilcoxon signed
rank test in R v2.12.0.
