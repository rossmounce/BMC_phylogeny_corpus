Bioinformatics analysis of rabbit haemorrhagic
disease virus genome
Xiao-ting Tian†, Bao-yu Li†, Liang Zhang, Wen-qiang Jiao and Ji-xing Liu*

Abstract
Background: Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), as the pathogeny of Rabbit haemorrhagic disease, can
cause a highly infectious and often fatal disease only affecting wild and domestic rabbits. Recent researches
revealed that it, as one number of the Caliciviridae, has some specialties in its genome, its reproduction and so on.
Results: In this report, we firstly analyzed its genome and two open reading frameworks (ORFs) from this aspect of
codon usage bias. Our researches indicated that mutation pressure rather than natural is the most important
determinant in RHDV with high codon bias, and the codon usage bias is nearly contrary between ORF1 and ORF2,
which is maybe one of factors regulating the expression of VP60 (encoding by ORF1) and VP10 (encoding by
ORF2). Furthermore, negative selective constraints on the RHDV whole genome implied that VP10 played an
important role in RHDV lifecycle.
Conclusions: We conjectured that VP10 might be beneficial for the replication, release or both of virus by
inducing infected cell apoptosis initiate by RHDV. According to the results of the principal component analysis for
ORF2 of RSCU, we firstly separated 30 RHDV into two genotypes, and the ENC values indicated ORF1 and ORF2
were independent among the evolution of RHDV.

1. Background
Synonymous codons are not used randomly [1]. The
variation of codon usage among ORFs in different
organisms is accounted by mutational pressure and
translational selection as two main factors [2,3]. Levels
and causes of codon usage bias are available to understand viral evolution and the interplay between viruses
and the immune response [4]. Thus, many organisms
such as bacteria, yeast, Drosophila, and mammals, have
been studied in great detail up on codon usage bias and
nucleotide composition [5]. However, same researches
in viruses, especially in animal viruses, have been less
studied. It has been observed that codon usage bias in
human RNA viruses is related to mutational pressure, G
+C content, the segmented nature of the genome and

the route of transmission of the virus [6]. For some vertebrate DNA viruses, genome-wide mutational pressure
is regarded as the main determinant of codon usage
rather than natural selection for specific coding triplets
[4]. Analysis of the bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV1)
late genes has revealed a relationship between codon
usage and tRNA availability [7]. In the mammalian
papillomaviruses, it has been proposed that differences
from the average codon usage frequencies in the host
genome strongly influence both viral replication and
gene expression [8]. Codon usage may play a key role in
regulating latent versus productive infection in EpsteinBarr virus [9]. Recently, it was reported that codon
usage is an important driving force in the evolution of
astroviruses and small DNA viruses [10,11]. Clearly, studies of synonymous codon usage in viruses can reveal
much about the molecular evolution of viruses or individual genes. Such information would be relevant in
understanding the regulation of viral gene expression.
Up to now, little codon usage analysis has been performed on Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV),
which is the pathogen causing Rabbit haemorrhagic

disease (RHD), also known as rabbit calicivirus disease
(RCD) or viral haemorrhagic disease (VHD), a highly
infectious and often fatal disease that affects wild and
domestic rabbits. Although the virus infects only rabbits,
RHD continues to cause serious problems in different
parts of the world. RHDV is a single positive stranded
RNA virus without envelope, which contains two open
reading frames (ORFs) separately encoding a predicted
polyprotein and a minor structural protein named VP10
[12]. After the hydrolysis of self-coding 3C-like cysteinase, the polyprotein was finally hydrolyzed into 8 cleavage products including 7 nonstructural proteins and 1
structural protein named as VP60 [13,14]. Studies on
the phylogenetic relationship of RHDVs showed only
one serotype had been isolated, and no genotyping for
RHDV was reported. It reported that the VP10 was
translated with an efficiency of 20% of the preceding
ORF1 [15]. In order to better understand the characteristics of the RHDV genome and to reveal more information about the viral genome, we have analyzed the
codon usage and dinucleotide composition. In this
report, we sought to address the following issues concerning codon usage in RHDV: (i) the extent and causes
of codon bias in RHDV; (ii) A possible genotyping of
RHDV; (iii) Codon usage bias as a factor reducing the
expression of VP10 and (iiii) the evolution of the ORFs.

2.2 The relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) in
RHDV

To investigate the characteristics of synonymous codon
usage without the influence of amino acid composition,
RSCU values of each codon in a ORF of RHDV were
calculated according to previous reports (2 Sharp,
Tuohy et al. 1986) as the followed formula:
RSCU =

gij
ni

ni

g ij
j

Where gij is the observed number of the ith codon for
jth amino acid which has ni type of synonymous codons.
The codons with RSCU value higher than 1.0 have positive codon usage bias, while codons with value lower
than 1.0 has relative negative codon usage bias. As
RSCU values of some codons are nearly equal to 1.0, it
means that these codons are chosen equally and
randomly.

2.3 The content of each nucleotides and G+C at the
synonymous third codon position (GC3s)

The index GC3s means the fraction of the nucleotides
G+C at the synonymous third codon position, excluding
Met, Trp, and the termination codons.
2.4 The effective number of codons (ENC)

The ENC, as the best estimator of absolute synonymous
codon usage bias [16], was calculated for the quantification of the codon usage bias of each ORF [17]. The predicted values of ENC were calculated as
ENC = 2 + s +

29
s2 + (1 − s2 )

where s represents the given (G+C) 3 % value. The
values of ENC can also be obtained by EMBOSS CHIPS
program [18].

2.5 Dn and ds of two ORFs

Analyses were conducted with the Nei-Gojobori model
[19], involving 30 nucleotide sequences. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. The values
of dn, ds and ω (dn/ds) were calculated in MEGA4.0 [20].

usage pattern [22]. This analysis was implemented based
on the Spearman’s rank correlation analysis way.
All statistical processes were carried out by with statistical software SPSS 17.0 for windows.

3. Results
2.6 Correspondence analysis (COA)

3.1 Measures of relative synonymous codon usage

Multivariate statistical analysis can be used to explore the
relationships between variables and samples. In this study,
correspondence analysis was used to investigate the major
trend in codon usage variation among ORFs. In this study,
the complete coding region of each ORF was represented
as a 59 dimensional vector, and each dimension corresponds to the RSCU value of one sense codon (excluding
Met, Trp, and the termination codons) [21].

The values of nucleotide contents in complete coding
region of all 30 RHDV genomes were analyzed and
listed in Table 2 and Table 3. Evidently, (C+G)% content
of the ORF1 fluctuated from 50.889 to 51.557 with a
mean value of 51.14557, and (C+G)% content of the
ORF2 were ranged from 35.593 to 40.113 with a mean
value of 37.6624, which were indicating that nucleotides
A and U were the major elements of ORF2 against
ORF1. Comparing the values of A 3 %, U 3 %, C 3 % and
G3 %, it is clear that C 3 % was distinctly high and A 3 %
was the lowest of all in ORF1 of RHDV, while U3% was
distinctly high and C3% was the lowest of all in ORF2 of

2.7 Correlation analysis

Correlation analysis was used to identify the relationship
between nucleotide composition and synonymous codon

RHDV. The (C3+G3) % in ORF1 fluctuated from 57.014
to 58.977 with a mean value of 57.68287 and (C3+G3)%
were range from 31.356 to 39.831 with a mean value of
34.8337. And the ENC values of ORF1 fluctuated from
54.192 to 55.491 with a mean value of 54.95 and ENC
values of ORF2 displayed a far-ranging distribution from
39.771 to 51.964 with a mean value of 44.46. The ENC
values of ORF1 were a little high indicating that there is
a particular extent of codon preference in ORF1, but the
codon usage is relatively randomly selected in ORF2 on
the base of ENC values. The details of the overall relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values of 59
codons for each ORF in 30 RHDV genomes were listed
in Table 4. Most preferentially used codons in ORF1
were C-ended or G-ended codons except Ala, Pro and
Ser, however, A-ended or G-ended codons were preferred as the content of ORF2.
In addition, the dn, ds and ω(dN/dS) values of ORF1
were separately 0.014, 0.338 and 0.041, and the values of

ORF2 were 0.034, 0.103 and 0.034, respectively. The ω
values of two ORFs in RHDV genome are generally low,
indicating that the RHDV whole genome is subject to
relatively strong selective constraints.
3.2 Correspondence analysis

COA was used to investigate the major trend in codon
usage variation between two ORFs of all 30 RHDV
selected for this study. After COA for RHDV Genome,
one major trend in the first axis (f’1) which accounted
for 42.967% of the total variation, and another major
trend in the second axis (f’ 2 ) which accounted for
3.632% of the total variation. The coordinate of the
complete coding region of each ORF was plotted in Figure 1 defining by the first and second principal axes. It
is clear that coordinate of each ORF is relatively isolated. Interestingly, we found that relatively isolated
spots from ORF2 tend to cluster into two groups: the
ordinate value of one group (marked as Group 1) is

3.3 Correlation analysis

To estimate whether the evolution of RHDV genome
on codon usage was regulated by mutation pressure or
natural selection, the A%, U%, C%, G% and (C+G)%
were compared with A 3 %, U 3 %, C 3 %, G 3 % and (C 3
+G3)%, respectively (Table 5). There is a complex correlation among nucleotide compositions. In detail,
A 3 %, U 3 %, C 3 % and G 3 % have a significant negative
correlation with G%, C%, U% and A% and positive correlation with A%, U%, C% and G%, respectively. It suggests that nucleotide constraint may influence
synonymous codon usage patterns. However, A3% has
non-correlation with U% and C%, and U 3 % has noncorrelation with A% and G%, respectively, which
haven’t indicated any peculiarity about synonymous
codon usage. Furthermore, C 3 % and G 3 % have non-

correlation with A%, G% and U%, C%, respectively,
indicating these data don’t reflect the true feature of
synonymous codon usage as well. Therefore, linear
regression analysis was implemented to analyze the
correlation between synonymous codon usage bias and
nucleotide compositions. Details of correlation analysis
between the first two principle axes (f’1 and f’2) of each
RHDV genome in COA and nucleotide contents were
listed in Table 6. In surprise, only f2 values are closely
related to base nucleotide A and G content on the
third codon position only, suggesting that nucleotide A
and G is a factor influencing the synonymous codon
usage pattern of RHDV genome. However, f’1 value has
non-correlation with base nucleotide contents on the
third codon position; it is observably suggest that
codon usage patterns in RHDV were probably influenced by other factors, such as the second structure of
viral genome and limits of host. In spite of that, compositional constraint is a factor shaping the pattern of
synonymous codon usage in RHDV genome.

4. Discussion
There have been more and more features that are unique
to RHDV within the family Caliciviridae, including its single host tropism, its genome and its VP10 as a structural
protein with unknown function. After we analyzed synonymous codon usage in RHDV (Table 2), we obtained several conclusions and conjectures as followed.
4.1 Mutational bias as a main factor leading to
synonymous codon usage variation

ENC-plot, as a general strategy, was utilized to investigate
patterns of synonymous codon usage. The ENC-plots of
ORFs constrained only by a C3+G3 composition will lie on
or just below the curve of the predicted values [18]. ENC
values of RHDV genomes were plotted against its corresponding (C3+G3) %. All of the spots lie below the curve
of the predicted values, as shown in Figure 2, suggesting
that the codon usage bias in all these 30 RHDV genomes
is principally influenced by the mutational bias.

Page 7 of 9

4.2 A proof for codon usage bias as a factor reducing the
expression of VP10

As we know, the efficiency of gene expression is influenced by regulator sequences or elements and codon
usage bias. It reported that the RNA sequence of the 3terminal 84 nucleotides of ORF1were found to be crucial
for VP10 expression instead of the encoded peptide.
VP10 coding by ORF2 has been reported as a low expressive structural protein against VP60 coding by ORF1 [5].
And its efficiency of translation is only 20% of VP60.
According to results showed by Table 4, it revealed the
differences in codon usage patterns of two ORFs, which
is a possible factor reducing the expression of VP10.
4.3 Negative selective constraints on the RHDV whole
genome

Although VP10 encoded by ORF2, as a minor structural
protein with unknown functions, has been described by
LIU as a nonessential protein for virus infectivity, the ω

GC3s and ENC in the absence of selection. All of spots lie below the expected curve.

value of ORF2 suggests VP10 plays an important role in
the certain stage of whole RHDV lifecycle. After combining with low expression and ω value of VP10, we
conjectured that VP10 might be beneficial for the replication, release or both of virus by inducing infected cell
apoptosis initiate by RHDV. This mechanism has been
confirmed in various positive-chain RNA viruses, including coxsackievirus, dengue virus, equine arterivirus, footand-mouth disease virus, hepatitis C virus, poliovirus,
rhinovirus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome
[23-29], although the details remain elusive.

(encoding by ORF2). Furthermore, negative selective
constraints on the RHDV whole genome implied that
VP10 played an important role in RHDV lifecycle. We
conjectured that VP10 might be beneficial for the replication, release or both of virus by inducing infected cell
apoptosis initiate by RHDV. According to the results of
the principal component analysis for ORF2 of RSCU, we
firstly separated 30 RHDV into two genotypes, and the
ENC values indicated ORF1 and ORF2 were independent among the evolution of RHDV. All the results will
guide the next researches on the RHDV as a reference.

4.4 Independent evolution of ORF1 and ORF2

As preceding description, ENC reflects the evolution of
codon usage variation and nucleotide composition to
some degree. After the correlation analysis of ENC
values between ORF1 and ORF2 (Table 7), the related
coefficient of ENC values of two ORFs is 0.230, and p
value is 0.222 more than 0.05. These data revealed that
no correlation existed in ENC values of two ORFs, indicating that codon usage patterns and evolution of two
ORFs are separated each other. Further, this information
maybe helps us well understand why RSCU and ENC
between two ORFs are quite different.
4.5 A possible genotyping basis

Interestingly, we found that relatively isolated spots
from ORF2 tend to cluster into two groups: the ordinate
value of one group (marked as Group 1) is positive
value and the other one (marked as Group 2) is negative
value. And all of those strains isolated before 2000
belonged to Group 2, including Italy-90, RHDV-V351,
RHDV-FRG, BS89, RHDV-SD and M67473.1. Although
RHDV has been reported as only one type, this may be
a reference on dividing into two genotypes.

5. Conclusion
In this report, we firstly analyzed its genome and two
open reading frameworks (ORFs) from this aspect of
codon usage bias. Our researches indicated that mutation pressure rather than natural is the most important
determinant in RHDV with high codon bias, and the
codon usage bias is nearly contrary between ORF1 and
ORF2, which is maybe one of factors regulating the
expression of VP60 (encoding by ORF1) and VP10
