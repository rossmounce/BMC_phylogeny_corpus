Abstract
Background: The enormous database of microbial DNA generated from the Sargasso Sea
metagenome provides a unique opportunity to locate genes participating in different biosynthetic
pathways and to attempt to understand the relationship and evolution of those genes. In this article,
an analysis of the Sargasso Sea metagenome is made with respect to the seven genes of the
tryptophan pathway.
Results: At least 5% of all the genes that are related to amino acid biosynthesis are tryptophan
(trp) genes. Many contigs and scaffolds contain whole or split operons that are similar to previously
analyzed trp gene organizations. Only two scaffolds discovered in this analysis possess a different
operon organization of tryptophan pathway genes than those previously known. Many marine
organisms lack an operon-type organization of these genes or have mini-operons containing only
two trp genes. In addition, the trpB genes from this search reveal that the dichotomous division
between trpB_1 and trpB_2 also occurs in organisms from the Sargasso Sea. One cluster was found
to contain trpB sequences that were closely related to each other but distinct from most known
trpB sequences.
Conclusion: The data show that trp genes are widely dispersed within this metagenome. The
novel organization of these genes and an unusual group of trpB_1 sequences that were found among
some of these Sargasso Sea bacteria indicate that there is much to be discovered about both the
reason for certain gene orders and the regulation of tryptophan biosynthesis in marine bacteria.

Background

The tryptophan pathway and the organization of the trp genes
involved in its synthesis have been a model system for many
years and these genes continue to receive attention [1,2]. With
the availability of extensive DNA sequences, it has been found
that trp genes are not identically organized in all organisms.

The classical structure of the trp operon contains genes for all
seven catalytic domains in the following order: promoter,
trpE, trpG, trpD, trpC, trpF, trpB and trpA. In some organisms each catalytic domain is encoded by a different gene. As
shown in Figure 1, there are seven catalytic domains that

trpE encodes the large aminase subunit of anthranilate synthase; trpG encodes for small glutamine binding subunit of anthranilate synthase and catalyzes the

carry out the reactions that convert chorismate and Lglutamine to L-tryptophan.
To date, several deviations from the classical structure have
been reported. Gene fusion may result in a single polypeptide
carrying two or more catalytic domains. The most extreme
exception is found in the eukaryote Euglena in which a single
gene encodes a polypeptide with five catalytic domains [3]. In
split operons, the trp genes are organized into two or more
sub-operons [4]. Other events include gene reshuffling, gene
insertions and gene deletions. An analysis of more than 100
genomes showed that the evolution of trp operon is both the
result of vertical genealogy and lateral gene transfer. It has
been found that, if events of lateral gene transfer and paralogy
can be sorted out, the vertical transfer of the trp genes
becomes apparent [4,5].

As a result of the publication of the Sargasso Sea metagenome
by Venter et al. [6], it may be possible to deduce the evolutionary relationships between the trp genes of different
marine organisms from the Sargasso Sea. This metagenome
is composed of more than one million non-redundant
sequences, or reads, that have been estimated to derive from
1,800 different genomes, including 148 phylotypes. These
sequences were assembled and scanned for the presence of
open reading frames, which were then annotated and analyzed [6]. Overall, more than 1.2 million putative genes were
identified, including 37,118 genes for amino acid biosynthesis. Tryptophan pathway genes should be widely represented
among these sequences. A vast amount of information about
the trp genes from various bacterial species exists in the literature and the Sargasso Sea metagenome data should contribute much to our knowledge of the evolution and
organizational diversity of these important genes [7], in par-

ticular those from a marine environment. Marine bacteria live
in an exacting environment that makes selective demands on
its inhabitants-in quite a different way to the terrestrial
environment.
We have made an extensive search for tryptophan pathway
genes within the metagenome data. Our major goal was to
determine whether the classical structure of the trp operon
predominates in marine microorganisms and whether novel
structures are present. This information should help us look
at questions about the origin of the trp genes and the genetic
and selective processes that have acted on them including
their lateral transfer between different bacterial species

Results
Computer search for tryptophan pathway genes
Contigs and scaffolds from the Sargasso Sea metagenome
were screened for trp genes. The search was run seven times,
each using the amino acid sequence of a different Bacillus
subtilis trp gene. Among contigs and scaffolds, we found
2,926 that had trp genes. Of these, 879 contained 2 or more
trp genes and 2,047 contained only a single trp gene. After
removing repeats resulting from sequences carrying several
trp genes, we found 1,928 trp genes that were associated with
at least one other trp gene, which makes it very likely that
these are trp genes. A total of 4,009 trp-like genes were found
but some of these might be pseudogenes. That is, a minimum
of 5% of all the genes for amino acid biosynthesis (37,118
genes [6]) are trp-like genes
The gene order E-G-D-C-F-B-A was taken as the prototype for
complete operons. For "split-operons", the prototypes used
were E-G-D-C and F-B-A. Table 1 shows the distribution of
the contigs for different trp genes. The assembly of important
scaffolds and contigs (see Table 2) was verified by re-assembling their reads using the SEQUENCHER program version
4.1.2 by Gene Codes Corporation (Ann Arbor, MI, USA). The
resulting assembly was found to be consistent with that pre-

viously generated by the Celera Assembler [6] The amount of
coverage gives an estimate of the frequency of a contig within
the population of organisms sampled and was determined for
each contig. The results of this search are presented in Table
2. Full and split operons with a classical structure are widely
represented.
Table 1 also gives the results for each separate gene. It shows
that different genes are not represented with equal frequency:
trpE, trpG and trpB are over-represented. A possible explanation for this is that trpE and trpG homologues take part in
other biochemical pathways such as the pathway for paraamino benzoic acid [8] and have been incorrectly identified as
trp genes.
A computer search of this type cannot determine the actual
enzymatic activity of a particular coding region and this can
lead to an over-representation of certain genes. An analysis of
the trpG and pabA genes, which are almost certainly derived
from a common source, showed that these cannot be distinguished from one another unless they are associated with an
adjacent trp gene (for trpG) or a pab gene (for pabA). In the
cases where there is no ambiguity as to their identity, it was
found that these two genes from the same organism were
often more closely related than when they were compared to
their counterparts in other organisms (data not shown). An
analysis of the trpE and pabB genes, which also have a common origin, gave similar results. Gene duplication could also
cause an apparent over-representation and this is discussed
below in reference to the occurrence of the two kinds of trpB
genes. Genes that encode enzymes that act in more than one
pathway and catalyze similar reactions can either appear in
searches done on two different pathways or not appear in
either search. An example of this phenomenon is the trpF
gene, which is discussed below.
In order to determine the extent of coverage by this search
method, an analysis of the trpE, trpD and trpA genes was

made using the genes from the ten different organisms listed
in Table 3 as probes. The results of these searches for trpD
and trpA are shown in Table 3.
The analysis of trpE sequences is complicated by the concomitant detection of pabB sequences. New trpE sequences were
uncovered and these usually represent about 10% of those
detected using the Bacillus probe. Using probes of ten species
to search for trpD led to the discovery of an average of about
3% for each probe. However as many of the new genes will
appear in more than one search, only an additional 10% (46/
468) of new trpD genes were found in toto. Table 3 also
presents the data for trpA, another gene for which little ambi-

guity is anticipated. That search again led to the discovery of
new genes (an average of 4.5% per search) but again the total
of new trpA genes from the ten probes was only 12% (54/
463). Therefore, the coverage provided by the Bacillus
probes, while not complete, renders a fairly accurate picture
of the trp genes in the Sargasso Sea metagenome database.
We would expect that using more and more probes would be
subject to the law of diminishing returns.

contain several trp genes. Some scaffolds have all seven trp
genes grouped together. The descriptions of several scaffolds

of particular interest are presented in Table 5. Eleven of the
24 scaffolds and contigs containing 4 trp genes were lacking
flanking sequences, and therefore could not be considered as
split operons. The other 13 had genes unrelated to the trp
operon on both ends, or at least after the trpC gene (for split
operons of the EGDC type), and therefore fit the definition of
split operons. In the 61 scaffolds and contigs that have three
genes together, only 16 contain trp genes flanked by those
that are unrelated and can be unambiguously denoted as
split-operons. The following previously described split-operons were found: E→G→D→C, F→B→A, F→B→X→A. Calculations of frequencies of gene pairs (Figure 2) hint that the
first two split operons are the most abundant within the Sargasso Sea metagenome, while other organizations, including
the classical full operon, are much less abundant. This conclusion may be supported by the very few C→F pairs that have
been found.

As illustrated in Figure 3, most of the complete and incomplete trp gene clusters maintain the structure of the prototype
trp operon. All genes within these clusters have the same
direction of transcription and the same gene order. Two of the
split operons, [GenBank: AACY01080023] and [GenBank:
AACY01120345], seem to be from the genome of Burkholderia SAR-1, while two full operons described in Table 5 seem to
come from Shewanella SAR 1 and 2. As the sequences of these
do not differ from those found earlier for those organism and
the probable source of these is a filter contamination as has
been stated in several papers [9,10] they were not taken into
account in our calculations.
Two contigs show a different type of organization than that
generally found in bacteria. In one contig [GenBank:
AACY01110889] trpF is followed by a gene that is a fusion
between trpE and trpG. This contig is a part of a scaffold,
[GenBank: CH022404], which shows no similarity to any

One interesting feature of the trp genes of Burkholderia SAR-1
should be mentioned: in all previously known genomes of
Burkholderia sp., the split-operons contain F→B→X→A where
"X" is unrelated to known trp genes. The sequence from the
Sargasso Sea metagenome of SAR-1 Burkholderia-like sequences
contains an F→X→A split operon. The computer program used
by Venter and colleagues failed to identify a trpB gene within the
sequence. However when a search was made using the
Burkholderia trpB sequence as a probe, a trpB gene was detected
between trpF and X, as is true for all other Burkholderia species
and there were no non-trp genes between trpF and trpB.

scaffolds failed to reveal any significant similarity between
them and known genomes.

due to the existence of homologous genes as mentioned
above, other trp genes are also observed in a "detached" manner. This indicates that the trp genes of marine organisms are
frequently detached or occur as pairs.

A phylogenetic analysis of some of these complete and split
operons was made against operons from known organisms.
The results are presented in Figure 4. All the full operons are
much more related to the full operons of known organisms
than they are to the split operons of other known species. The
figure also shows that most of the split operons are grouped
with split operons from known organisms. The four exceptions to this rule are probably due to incomplete sequences
and these are likely to be full operons. This analysis also supports our hypothesis that split operons are more prevalent
than full operons (Figure 2) in the Sargasso Sea metagenome

The existence of pairs of trp genes makes good sense biochemically. Anthranilate synthase is composed of an equal
number of trpE and trpD encoded subunits. Tryptophan synthase contains two subunits each of the polypeptides from the
trpA and trpB genes. The trpG when unfused to trpE or trpD
leads to a polypeptide also found in equimolar amounts to
those from trpE and trpD. Organizing these specific genes in
pairs would seem to ensure that they are transcribed together
and render the proper amounts of the translation products.

Non-operon organization
As shown in Table 4, 70% of the contigs and scaffolds detected
have a single trp gene. Those with two trp genes are also very
prevalent (26%) even though some of these are probably partial segments of larger operons. As shown in Table 6, 133 scaffolds and contigs carry one or two trp genes enclosed between
non-trp genes. While trpE and trpG may be overrepresented

The occurrence of detached trp genes is apparently an adaptation to the particular environment in which marine organisms are found. Most of the bacteria previously analyzed
probably encounter periods of feast and famine with regard to
tryptophan. Therefore they need to respond to external conditions that vary. The existence of transport systems for concentrating externally found tryptophan and the organization
of the trp biosynthetic genes into operons almost certainly
reflect their environmental challenges. In contrast, marine

organisms exist in a rather constant environment with
respect to tryptophan. It is unlikely that tryptophan from
external sources is available and this amino acid must be synthesized entirely within the bacterial cell. The main regulation of the pathway is expected to be at the level of feedback
inhibition and it is probable that trp gene expression is constitutive rather than controlled by the mechanism of repression-derepression. The level of expression of a detached trp
gene can be controlled simply by modifying the strength of
the associated promoter. A trp repressor or repressors and
attenuation become superfluous under such circumstances.
This should extend to most or all of the other genes involved
in amino acid biosynthesis. Therefore axenic cultures of some
of these marine organisms are eagerly awaited.

Conserved non-trp flanking genes
Another way of examining the evolution of the trp genes and
the relationships between various species is the analysis of
genes not involved in tryptophan biosynthesis that either
neighbor the trp genes or are inserted between them. Xie and
colleagues have reported that trpF, trpB and trpA in splitpathway operons are flanked by conserved genes that are
unrelated to tryptophan biosynthesis [4]. They have found
genes that encode the β-subunit of acetyl-coenzymeA-carboxylase (accD), folylpolyglutamate synthase/dihydrofolate
synthase (folC), fimbria V protein (lysM) and the tRNA pseudouridine synthase (truA). In most cases the genes accD and
folC follow trpA. For the Thiobacillus-Pseudomonas-Azotobacter cluster and others, the trpF-trpB-trpA operon is
flanked on the trpF side by lysM and truA. The presence of
particular genes appearing near those of trp was examined
using the Sargasso Sea metagenome data and the results of
this analysis are shown in Table 7.
The first three rows of Table 7 confirm previous publications.
In addition, four other genes, not previously noted, were
found with high frequencies near the trp genes of the
Sargasso Sea metagenome: pyrF (orotidine-5'-phosphate
decarboxylase), lexA (the SOS-response transcriptional
repressor), moaC (a protein related to the molybdenum
cofactor) and PLPDE_IV (the class of amino acid aminotransferases). It should be mentioned that PLPDE_IV is
the only gene, besides aroG and aroH (see below), found near
the trp genes that can be logically connected to tryptophan
biosynthesis. This class of amino-transferases includes some
D-amino acid transferases, pyridoxal-5-phosphate-dependent enzymes such as tryptophanase, and others. If in fact the
cell is able to use D-tryptophan as a source of L-tryptophan
via a D-amino acid transferase, then the inclusion of a gene
encoding such an activity among the trp genes would make

sense as this gene would undergo derepression in coordination with those involved in L-tryptophan biosynthesis.
It is clear that specific neighboring genes are very prevalent
when a split trp operon occurs. It seems unlikely that the
same event has occurred many times: strains with these particular flanking genes are most likely derived from a common
ancestor.

Analysis of trpB genes
Surprisingly, it has been found that a significant number of
organisms possess more than one trpB gene encoding the βchain of tryptophan synthase. Usually, but not always, the
'extra' gene is unlinked to the trpA gene encoding the α chain
of this enzyme. These extra trpB genes belong to a distinct
subgroup encoding the β-chain which is termed trpB_2. This
had been recognized in the COGs database as "alternative
tryptophan synthase" - COG1350 [11] while the major group is
denoted as trpB_1 and includes the well-studied polypeptides
from such organisms as Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium and Bacillus subtilis. The minor trpB_2 group
includes mostly, but not exclusively, archaeal species. The
evolution and properties of trpB_2, have been analyzed and
discussed in a number of recent articles [12-15].
The 3-dimensional structure of tryptophan synthase from
Salmonella typhimurium has been elucidated by X-ray crystallography to a resolution of 2.5 angstroms [16]. The enzyme
is a αββα complex which forms an internal hydrophobic tunnel into which indole, produced by the a subunit, enters and
then reaches the active site of the b subunit. The α monomers
and β dimers contact one another via a highly specific mechanism of recognition. In addition, the genes encoding these
two subunits are almost always closely linked and their
expression is frequently translationally coupled [17,18].
The data collected from the Sargasso Sea metagenome were
examined to determine whether the trpB sequences from the
Sargasso Sea differ from those of known organisms and
whether both trpB_1 and trpB_2 exist in this sample. When
a phylogenetic analysis of trpB genes found in the present
survey was conducted, it was found that the majority of these
(Figure 5) fall into the trpB_1 group while a few trpB_2 genes
also occur. Among the trpB_1 genes, one cluster is quite distinct and probably split off from major type at a relatively
early stage. Genes in this cluster have a high similarity to the
marine bacterium Pelagibacter ubique (Candidatus)
HTCC1062 (SAR11) and the sequence identity of these to P.
ubique at the amino acid level was between 64% and 87%
while the genes neighboring some of these trpBs showed an

even higher identity to their counterparts from SAR11. One of
the most remarkable features of P. ubique is its extremely
small genome that lacks any pseudogenes or recent gene
duplications. It has only one copy of trpB, and therefore it can
be concluded that this gene must be functional in tryptophan
biosynthesis and not a pseudogene. P. ubique contains two
split operons: trpE-trpG-trpD-trpC and trpF-trpB-trpA. The
gene order of the neighboring, non-related trp genes of the
second split operon is: (gene not mentioned above) himDpyrF-trpF-trpB-trpA-accD-folC. The himD gene encodes a
sequence-specific DNA-binding transcriptional activator.
Comparison of the gene order between contigs containing
SAR11-like trpB from the Sargasso Sea metagenome showed
that most of the contigs have a gene order that is similar to
SAR11. Three of 37 contigs lack trpF and 2 contigs contain
only a trpB gene flanked by genes unrelated to trp and which
are similar in sequence and order to that of SAR11. This indicates that most or all of these trpB genes are part of the SAR11
group. Since the trpB of SAR11 is more closely related to
trpB_1 than to trpB_2 [19], it seems that the genes from this
particular cluster should probably be considered to be of the
trpB_1 type.

Discussion

The tryptophan operon of bacteria has been studied for more
than 50 years and its structure and regulation are known for
many terrestrial organisms that can be grown in laboratory
culture. With the explosive expansion of genomics during the
last decade and the data thus generated, many trp sequences

from both known and unknown marine species have become
available. This provides an excellent opportunity for expanding our knowledge about the ways in which different organisms, particularly marine bacteria, have organized these
genes. In the present research, trp pathway genes within the
Sargasso Sea database were retrieved by BLAST analysis
using known trp protein sequences. It was found that trp
genes account for about 5% of all genes that were previously
identified as genes for amino acid synthesis in the Sargasso
Sea metagenome. In almost all cases in which the trp genes
form an operon, the order and direction of transcription of
the trp genes are similar to familiar prototypes. The reason
for this conservation remains unknown. This might be
explained in part by an advantage conferred when genes
whose products form complexes are adjacent to one another
and translational coupling occurs. Of the 85 contigs and
scaffolds that contain three or four trp genes, only 29 could be
unambiguously defined as containing split pathway operons.
The following already known orders of split operons were
found: E→G→D→C, F→B→A. In addition, we have found
evidence for completely dispersed trp genes in the form of
isolated and pairs of genes.
Since these marine organisms survive and grow in a very different environment from those organisms previously studied,
they are likely to have been genetically separated from them
and to have evolved to solve the particular regulatory problems that exist in their environment. It was expected that
some marine bacteria would exhibit novel organizations of
these genes and such organizations were in fact found.

Among the trp genes organized into operon structures, most
resemble examples already discovered. In addition, two previously unknown groupings were uncovered in the present
search. However a notable quantity of genes that were either
detached or in mini-operons containing only two trp genes
was discovered. Novel organizations of the trp genes probably
arise from adaptations to the marine environment and it is
likely that some marine bacteria will have unusual regulatory
features. Such features can only be elucidated when these
organisms become amenable to axenic culture. Cloning and
expressing these genes in the laboratory from those organisms that cannot yet be cultured may however provide a partial regulatory picture. In this regard, a search for genes
related to the trpR gene of Escherichia coli (the gene that
encodes the tryptophan repressor) in the Sargasso Sea
metagenome was performed. This search failed to reveal any
significant trpR homologs. This is not surprising, because
regulatory circuits undoubtedly arise later than the genes for
biosynthesis and are adaptations to specific environments.
Genes with unknown function have been previously found to
be inserted within the trp operon [4]. Such genes were found
between trpB and trpA in one contig from the Sargasso Sea
metagenome, a location already observed for some species of
Flavobacterium and Burkholderia. Another contig carried
such a gene between trpF and trpB. While the reason for the
presence of these non-trp genes is unclear and the possibility
exists that they are simply morons [20], it is possible that they
actually participate in tryptophan biosynthesis. That is, these
genes may not be essential for tryptophan synthesis but
rather aid it by increasing the catalysis of one of the enzymes
or by being involved in complex formation. Even a very small
advantage is expected to be of great importance for the
survival of an organism in an oligotrophic environment such
as that of the Sargasso Sea.
One should keep in mind that the arrangement of genes in
operon confers both advantages and disadvantages. The most
obvious advantage is that genes with similar function are

transcribed together. The greatest disadvantage is that,
unless some further level of regulation exists (differences in
the amounts of mRNA or its stability, the strength of
ribosomal binding sites, and so on), the amount of the
polypeptides from these genes will be the same even though
the resultant enzymes may have different catalytic rates [21].
The ones with slower rates will be the limiting factor. As a
result, when the genes are transcribed together, an excess of
some enzymes is likely to occur. However, the amount of
mRNA and polypeptide synthesis is only one aspect of the
control of the tryptophan pathway. Besides these, there are
two other levels of control that affect the amount of tryptophan synthesis within the cell. The first of these is feed-back
inhibition which influences the activity of the first two reactions [22], and thereby the amount of metabolites flowing
through the pathway. The second is the formation of multienzyme complexes that greatly increases the catalytic efficiency of the various reactions. In complexes, the product of
one reaction can be used directly by the next enzyme and the
concentration of the substrate in the vicinity of the second
enzyme is much higher than would occur were the two
enzymes separate. Examples of such complexes are trpEtrpD (trpG) and trpA-trpB and the trpC-trpF gene fusion in
Escherichia coli. In addition, one polypeptide can greatly
enhance the activity of a second when a complex is formed
(for example, in the trpA-trpB heterotetramer, αββα from
Escherichia coli [23-25].
Different solutions to the problems of optimal synthesis of
tryptophan and the regulation of trp gene expression would
not be surprising since this amino acid is one of the most
expensive in chemical terms. One solution might be to organize the trp genes in a different manner; another would be the
creation of trp gene fusions. Both of these have been
observed. Our analysis uncovered some known gene fusions,
E-G [GenBank: AACY01100727] and C-F [GenBank:
AACY01022048] and two novel fusion of a trp gene with a
gene unrelated to the trp genes: E-PLPDE_IV [GenBank:
AACY01077237] and F-TruA [GenBank: AACY01600616]. All

of above indicate that there is quite a lot of genetic diversity
among marine bacteria.
It was found that several specific genes are often neighbors of
the trp genes of marine microorganisms. When present in

contigs, lexA, pyrF and moaC were always placed after trpC.
This may be a general phenomenon but our information is
still too scanty to allow a definite conclusion to be drawn.
Similarity in gene order is usually taken to indicate an
evolutionary relationship between such segments. Of

Genome Biology 2008, 9:R20

http://genomebiology.com/2008/9/1/R20

Genome Biology 2008,

particular interest was the observation that in 3 cases aroH or
aroG occur adjacent to trpA. For these examples, the distance
between the end of trpA and the ensuing aro gene is 3, 18, or
20 base pairs, which makes it very likely that the two genes
are expressed together. The synthesis and activity of the
enzyme they encode, DAHP synthase, is involved in the synthesis of a precursor of chorismic acid and this aro gene is
often regulated by the level of tryptophan. Therefore such an
arrangement might make sense.
Since there is more than one kind of trpB gene, a comparison
was made of amino acid sequences of trpB genes from the
Sargasso Sea metagenome with those from known organisms.
The majority of the metagenomic trpB sequences detected fall
into the trpB_1 group while some others were related to the
trpB_2 group. One cluster containing a number of trpB_1
sequences is quite distant from the usual type and has a high
similarity to that of Pelagibacter ubique (Candidatus)
HTCC1062 (SAR11). This cluster probably diverged rather
early from the major trpB_1 line.

Conclusion

The present analysis has revealed that tryptophan genes are
rather frequent within the Sargasso Sea metagenome. All trp
genes that were found have enough similarity to COGs to be
recognized. This seems to indicate, but does not prove, that all
have come from a common ancestor. However, additional
genes for tryptophan biosynthesis may exist which we were
unable to detect with the probes employed. In this regard, it
has been reported [26] that some organisms indeed lack a
recognizable trpF in their genomes but are capable of growing
without external tryptophan. A gene whose sequence is not
homologous to known trpFs but whose product catalyzes this
reaction has in fact been found in Streptomyces coelicolor A3
and Mycobacterium tuberculosis HR37Rv [26]. This trpF
gene is an example of reticulate evolution because it can catalyze reactions in both the histidine and tryptophan pathways
[27,28]. A BLAST search with the amino acid sequence of the
trpF gene from Streptomyces coelicolor A3 gene (SCO2050)
against the Sargasso Sea metagenome data showed more than
500 hits that can be identified as hisA proteins. Thus, only a
functional analysis of these environmental sequences can
prove whether they can take part in both pathways or not. The
fact that a group of marine trpB_1 sequences are similar to
one another but quite distant from the major trpB_1 group
supports the idea that there may be trp genes that are not recognized as such by those sequences presently known.
While trp operons, both complete and split, exist in marine
bacteria, many trp genes are no longer found in that framework. In contrast to most terrestrial bacteria, the operon
structure is not used for the trp genes in some of marine origin. There are mini-operons of 2 genes in many cases (Table
5) and also an even more frequent occurrence of single trp
genes. It is of course an open question whether what we

Volume 9, Issue 1, Article R20

Kagan et al. R20.14

observe is the result of the breakup of an original operon
structure or that the trp operons at present have arisen from
these unlinked genes. Since the marine environment is very
exacting and selective, it is certain that organisms lacking an
operon structure for the trp genes have found an evolutionary
advantage in the organization of the trp genes that they possess. It should be mentioned that in Escherichia coli and Salmonella, about 50% of the genes encoding polypeptides
involved in amino acid synthesis are separate although their
trp genes are not. On the basis of our results in which novel
trp gene orders were found, it appears likely that further studies of the trp genes and their regulation and organization will
provide many future surprises.

Materials and methods
Analysis of Sargasso Sea metagenome database
Amino acid sequences with homology to each trp catalytic
domain were obtained from an NCBI BLAST search of the
Sargasso Sea metagenome database [29]. The amino acid
sequences from Bacillus subtilis of each pathway catalytic
domain were used as query entries for protein BLAST. Bacillus proteins were chosen as a starting point for the search
because the catalytic domains are encoded by separate genes.
In Bacillus six genes, except trpG, are organized into one
operon and have been intensively studied at the level of DNA,
RNA and protein levels [30-32]. For the trpB_2 search, the
sequence of Chlorobium tepidum CT0192 (Q8KF11) was
used. The list of trp genes has been generated in several steps.
First, BLAST searches of trp genes against the Sargasso Sea
metagenome has been performed, using an e-value threshold
of 1e-5. For cross validation, both peptide and DNA sequence
databases were searched and the results were compared.
While 95% of the ORFs were identified in both searches, some
were discovered only once. In such cases a manual check of
the results has been performed. In addition, genes that are
homologous to trp genes (PabA, PabB, PhzA and PhzB) were
used to remove misclassified trpE and trpG genes. As a result,
a list of contigs containing trp genes was created. Redundant
contigs were removed based on BLAST searches with a 95%
identity threshold. In the last step, contigs that belong to the
same scaffolds were identified and treated. The results of the
above semi-automatic process were validated by large-scale
manual examinations.
In order to assemble a contig, Venter and colleagues used the
Celera Assembler [6]. To validate the Sargasso Sea scaffolds
the following procedure was performed. First, all singleton
reads composing each scaffold were retrieved by conducting a
BLASTn search for the scaffolds against the Sargasso Sea
reads. Next, the SEQUENCHER program (Gene Codes
Corporation) was used for re-assembling the reads and the
results were compared to each original scaffold for validation.
No significant differences between the assemblies of the Celera Assembler and SEQUENCHER were found.

Coverage was calculated by recruiting reads from Sargasso
Sea using BLAST, considering only reads with 90% and
higher identity to the scaffold and at least 80% of the read taking part in the alignment. These parameters are rather stringent, but give a good indication with respect to the
distribution of each scaffold.

Phylogenetic analysis
Amino acid sequences of many trpB genes were used to analyze the phylogenetic relationships between different
environmental samples. Only genes encoding more than 251
amino acids were analyzed. The alignment was done using the
ClustalW program [33]. Neighbor joining (NJ) and maximum
parsimony (MP) analyses were conducted on protein data
sets using version 4.0b10 of PAUP [34]. Default parameters
were used in all analyses. Bootstrap resampling of NJ (1000
replicates) and MP (1000 replicates) trees were performed in
all analyses to evaluate the reliability of the inferred topologies. The resultant trees were viewed through the TreeView
(Win32) program [35]. To understand the relationship
between the sub-families each was analyzed both by
comparing one group against the others and to representative
trpB gene sequences that exist in the NCBI database.
