Abstract
Background: The clinical management of community-acquired respiratory tract infections (RTIs)
is complicated by the increasing worldwide prevalence of antibacterial resistance, in particular, βlactam and macrolide resistance, among the most common causative bacterial pathogens. This
study aimed to determine the mechanisms and molecular- and sero-epidemiology of antibacterial
resistance among the key paediatric respiratory pathogens in Japan.
Methods: Isolates were collected at 18 centres in Japan during 2002 and 2003 from children with
RTIs as part of the PROTEKT surveillance programme. A proportion of Haemophilus influenzae
isolates was subjected to sequencing analysis of the ftsI gene; phylogenetic relatedness was assessed
using multilocus sequence typing. Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were screened for macrolideresistance genotype by polymerase chain reaction and serotyped using the capsular swelling
method. Susceptibility of isolates to selected antibacterials was performed using CLSI methodology.
Results and Discussion: Of the 557 H. influenzae isolates collected, 30 (5.4%) were β-lactamasepositive [BL+], 115 (20.6%) were BL-nonproducing ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR; MIC ≥ 4 mg/L) and
79 (14.2%) were BL-nonproducing ampicillin-intermediate (BLNAI; MIC 2 mg/L). Dabernat Group
III penicillin binding protein 3 (PBP3) amino acid substitutions in the ftsI gene were closely
correlated with BLNAR status but phylogenetic analysis indicated marked clonal diversity. PBP
mutations were also found among BL+ and BL-nonproducing ampicillin-sensitive isolates. Of the
antibacterials tested, azithromycin and telithromycin were the most active against H. influenzae
(100% and 99.3% susceptibility, respectively). A large proportion (75.2%) of the 468 S. pneumoniae
isolates exhibited macrolide resistance (erythromycin MIC ≥ 1 mg/L); erm(B) was the most
common macrolide resistance genotype (58.8%), followed by mef(A) (37.2%). The most common
pneumococcal serotypes were 6B (19.7%), 19F (13.7%), 23F (13.5%) and 6A (12.8%). Telithromycin
and amoxicillin-clavulanate were the most active antibacterials against S. pneumoniae (99.8% and
99.6% susceptibility, respectively).
Conclusion: Approximately one-third of H. influenzae isolates from paediatric patients in Japan are
BLNAI/BLNAR, mainly as a result of clonally diverse PBP3 mutations. Together with the continued
high prevalence of pneumococcal macrolide resistance, these results may have implications for the
clinical management of paediatric RTIs in Japan.

Background
Community-acquired respiratory tract infections (RTIs)
such as pneumonia, bronchitis, tonsillitis/pharyngitis,
otitis media and bacterial sinusitis are prevalent conditions accounting for approximately three-quarters of all
outpatient antibacterial prescriptions [1], a large proportion of which are for children. Antibacterial therapy for
community-acquired RTIs is usually empirical [2]. However, the clinical management of community-acquired
RTIs is complicated by the increasing worldwide prevalence of antibacterial resistance, in particular β-lactam and
macrolide resistance, among the most common causative
bacterial pathogens [3-7]. This has important implications for the selection of appropriate and effective antibacterial therapy, especially for children in whom current
treatment options are largely limited to these two classes
of antibacterial agents.
Haemophilus influenzae is frequently implicated in paediatric community-acquired RTIs. Resistance of H. influenzae
to ampicillin has been increasing steadily since its emergence in the 1970s [8]. Until recently, β-lactamase (BL)
production has been the primary mechanism of ampicillin resistance among H. influenzae. However, the prevalence of BL-nonproducing ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR)
strains of H. influenzae now also appears to be increasing
[9,10]. This is of clinical significance, since BLNAR H.
influenzae are typically co-resistant to other commonly
prescribed β-lactams, including amoxicillin-clavulanate
and ampicillin-sulbactam, in addition to most cephalosporins [11].
The increasing global prevalence of antibacterial resistance among Streptococcus pneumoniae – another significant
respiratory pathogen – is cause for further concern. As a
result of the rapid evolution of β-lactam-resistant S. pneumoniae, macrolides have been increasingly used as initial
empirical therapy in community-acquired RTIs [2]. However, the global increase in macrolide-resistant strains of
S. pneumoniae now also threatens to compromise the use
of these antibacterials for the treatment of these conditions [4].
Such resistance trends highlight an urgent need for new
antibacterials for the treatment of paediatric communityacquired RTIs that are effective against the common respiratory pathogens, but which retain activity against isolates
resistant to current treatment options.
PROTEKT (Prospective Resistant Organism Tracking and
Epidemiology for the Ketolide Telithromycin) is a global,
multicentre surveillance study investigating the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial pathogens associated
with community-acquired RTIs. As part of this survey, a
study was undertaken in Japan to assess the BL status of H.

influenzae isolates collected from paediatric patients with
community-acquired RTIs and to determine the mechanism of resistance and molecular epidemiology of BLNAR
strains. The activities of several antibacterial agents against
these isolates and other key respiratory pathogens were
also assessed.

Methods
Isolate collection
Bacterial isolates were collected over four 1-week periods
(24–30 November 2002; 19–26 January 2003; 9–15
March 2003; and 15–21 June 2003) from children (aged
< 16 years) with community-acquired RTIs (sinusitis, tonsillitis, pharyngitis/laryngitis, otitis media, pneumonia,
bronchitis and others) at 18 centres in Japan. Acceptable
sources for isolates included blood, sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, middle-ear fluid, nasopharyngeal swabs
or aspirates, sinus aspirates and throat swabs. Isolates
from patients with nosocomial RTIs or cystic fibrosis were
excluded from this analysis. Duplicate strains, isolates
originating from existing collections and those of doubtful pathogenicity were also excluded.
Susceptibility testing
All isolates were transported to a central laboratory for
susceptibility testing (Mitsubishi Kagaku Bio-Clinical Laboratories Inc., Japan). For H. influenzae, BL production
was detected using the chromogenic nitrocefin method
(Unipath Ltd, Basingstoke, UK) and by isolates being
nonsusceptible to ampicillin MIC ≥ 2 mg/L). MICs of isolates to a panel of antibacterial agents (including telithromycin,
erythromycin,
azithromycin,
ampicillin,
amoxicillin-clavulanate and cefdinir) were determined
using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute
(CLSI) broth microdilution method [11] and interpreted
using established CLSI breakpoints [12].
Molecular methods
A proportion of H. influenzae isolates were analysed by
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and
sequencing of regions of the ftsI gene encoding the
transpeptidase domain of penicillin-binding protein
(PBP) 3A and/or PBP 3B as described by Dabernat et al.
[13] Phylogenetic relationships among H. influenzae
strains were determined by multilocus sequence typing
(MLST) of seven housekeeping genes as described previously [14].

All isolates of S. pneumoniae found to be resistant to erythromycin (MIC ≥ 1 mg/L) were analysed for the presence of
erm(B), mef(A) and erm(A) subclass erm(TR) macrolide
resistance gene sequences using a rapid-cycle multiplex
PCR method as described previously [15].

Serotyping of S. pneumoniae isolates was performed at
G.R. Micro Ltd (London, UK) using the Neufeld's
quellung reaction with Statens Serum Institute (SSI) antisera (SSI, Copenhagen, Denmark). The SSI was used as the
reference laboratory for quality assurance and rare serotypes.

Results
Patients
A total of 5,592 patients were included in this analysis.
Key demographics and patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Almost two-thirds (64.5%) of study participants were aged 0–5 years. Upper RTIs accounted for
61.6% of all community-acquired RTIs reported. Pharyngitis/laryngitis was the most common upper RTI (33.5%),
followed by unspecified upper RTIs and tonsillitis (14.1%

and 7.1%, respectively). Bronchitis was the most common
lower RTI, occurring in 23.4% of patients. Just over half of
all study participants (53.3%) received antibacterial therapy for the treatment of their community-acquired RTI.
Bacterial isolates
A total of 2,596 pathogens were collected in this study,
including 557 isolates of H. influenzae and 468 isolates of
S. pneumoniae.
Haemophilus influenzae
Of the 557 H. influenzae isolates collected, 115 (20.6%)
were BLNAR (MIC ≥ 4 mg/L) and 79(14.2%) were BLnonproducing ampicillin-intermediate (BLNAI MIC 2
mg/L). In total, 30(5.4%) isolates were found to be BL+.

A total of 110 BLNAR isolates were viable for molecular
analysis and a further 5 BLNAI, 14 BL-nonproducing ampicillin-sensitive (BLNAS), and 27 BL+ isolates were examined for comparison. In the 156 isolates analysed, ftsI
mutations resulted in amino acid substitutions at 23 different loci and 36 different combinations of these substitutions were found. One particular combination of
substitutions predominated (D350N, S357N, M377I,
S385T, L389F, N526K) – corresponding to PBP 3 Group
III in the classification scheme described by Dabernat et
al. [13], accounting for 58.3% (91/156) of the isolates
(Table 2). Classification of the remaining isolates into
Dabernat groups was difficult owing to the large number
of previously undescribed mutations. The distribution of
amino acid substitution types according to β-lactamase
and ampicillin resistance status is shown in Table 2. Of
the BLNAR isolates, 75.5% (83/110) were classified as
Dabernat Group III. None of the BLNAR or BLNAI isolates
had the wild-type (i.e., ampicillin-susceptible) PBP 3
sequence. By contrast, 39.0% (16/41) of the isolates that
were either BLNAS or BL+ had the wild-type PBP 3
sequence, with the remainder having mainly non-Group
III substitution patterns. MLST of the 156 isolates identified a total of 73 different sequence types: this lack of
genetic similarity in the BLNAR PBP 3 Group III, BLNAS

and BL+ H. influenzae isolates is shown in Additional file
1 and Figures 1, 2.
Azithromycin and telithromycin both showed good in
vitro activity against H. influenzae isolates (Table 3). All
557 H. influenzae isolates were susceptible to azithromycin (MIC ≤ 4 mg/L), while 553/557 (99.3%) were found
to be fully susceptible to telithromycin (MIC ≤ 4 mg/L),
including 99.5% (193/194) of BLNAR/I and 96.7% (29/
30) of BL+ isolates. The remaining four isolates (0.7%)
exhibited intermediate susceptibility to telithromycin
(MIC 8 mg/L). The majority of H. influenzae isolates,
81.7% (455/557), were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanate (MIC ≤ 4 mg/L); 59.8% (333/557) were susceptible
to ampicillin (MIC ≤ 1 mg/L); and 63.9% (356/557) were
susceptible to cefdinir (MIC ≤ 1 mg/L) (Table 3).
Streptococcus pneumoniae
Genotyping analysis of the 468 isolates of S. pneumoniae
collected during this study is shown in Table 4. Of the 352
isolates (75.2%) found to be macrolide-resistant (erythromycin MIC ≥ 1 mg/L), the vast majority expressed either
the erm(B) (58.8%) or mef(A) (37.2%) macrolide resistance genes. A small number of erythromycin-sensitive or
-intermediate S. pneumoniae isolates also expressed erm(B)
or mef(A).

The results of the serotyping analysis of all 468 S. pneumoniae isolates are shown in Figure 3. Overall, the most common serotypes were 6B (92/468 [19.7%]), 19F (64/468
[13.7%]), 23F(63/468 [13.5%]) and 6A (60/468

[12.8%]). The serotype distributions for erythromycinresistant, -intermediate and -sensitive isolates were similar.
The S. pneumoniae in vitro susceptibility rate for telithromycin (99.8% [467/468]; the remaining oneisolate had
intermediate susceptibility [MIC 2 mg/L]) and was comparable to that observed for amoxicillin-clavulanate
(99.6%). Lower susceptibility rates were recorded for
ampicillin (93.4%), erythromycin (22.2%), azithromycin
(24.6%) and cefdinir (58.8%) (Table 5).

Discussion
Results of this study indicate that a high prevalence of in
vitro resistance to conventional antibacterial agents, such
as azithromycin, erythromycin and cefdinir, existed
among the key paediatric respiratory pathogens in Japan
during the surveillance period in 2002 and 2003.
Although the data cannot be directly extrapolated to the
current status of antibacterial resistance in Japan, the
study highlights a number of potentially important issues
regarding the antibacterial susceptibility and epidemiology of the key respiratory tract pathogens.
One-fifth of all isolates of H. influenzae were found to be
BLNAR (20.6%), with a further 14.2% BLNAI and 5.4%
BL+. This is in keeping with the findings of other Japanese
studies, with results of one recent nationwide survey
showing 23.1% of all H. influenzae isolates collected to be
BLNAR and 6.0% BL+ [16]. Molecular epidemiological
analysis of a proportion of the H. influenzae isolates col-

amoxicillin-clavulanate and/or cephalosporin antibiotics
have been identified previously in isolates collected in
various countries, including Japan [17,18]. The identification of ftsI mutations in some BL+ H. influenzae strains
[11,19,20] may, in some cases, explain their decreased
susceptibility to non-β-lactam antibiotics.
Both azithromycin and telithromycin demonstrated good
in vitro activity against H. influenzae isolates collected in
this study, irrespective of BL+ or BLNAR/I, resistance
mechanism or serotype status. In contrast, only 24.6% of
S. pneumoniae isolates were fully susceptible to azithromycin, while telithromycin was highly active against this
pathogen, including isolates resistant to macrolides. Overall, three-quarters of the 468 S. pneumoniae isolates were
found to be macrolide-resistant, whereas only 1 isolate
exhibited low-level resistance to telithromycin. These

Prevalence (%)

To date, no conjugate pneumococcal vaccine has been
routinely used in Japan. The 7-valent conjugate vaccine
(PCV-7) is licensed in the USA and Europe and has coverage against serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F.
Only 55.2% (257/465) of the isolates in this study were
serotypes covered by PCV-7. If the potentially cross-reacting serotypes (6A and 19A) were added, coverage was
raised to 70.1%. However, the uncertainty regarding
cross-protection and the potential for serotype replacement underscore the need for serotype surveillance [23].
Although the results presented in this paper may have
important implications for the empiral antibiotic treatment of paediatric RTIs in Japan, two factors limit the
degree to which the data can be interpreted. Firstly, no
attempt was made to correlate in vitro resistance with
resistance in vivo that may lead to adverse clinical outcome. Secondly, the study did not distinguish between
isolates that may be colonising the respiratory tract from
those actually causing the infection. This is particularly
important when considering paediatric RTIs, as carriage of
common respiratory tract pathogens, such as S. pneumoniae, in children is extremely common [24].

observations are in keeping with the results of previous
analyses of paediatric S. pneumoniae isolates, which
showed telithromycin to be highly active against all
strains, irrespective of macrolide, azalide or clindamycin
resistance status [21,22].

Conclusion
In conclusion, this study provides a snapshot of the antibacterial susceptibility and epidemiology of key respiratory tract pathogens isolated from children in Japan
during 2002 and 2003. Approximately one-third of H.
influenzae isolates were BLNAI/BLNAR, mainly as a result
of clonally diverse PBP3 mutations. PBP3 mutations were
also common among BL+ and BLNAS isolates. Together
with the observed high prevalence of in vitro pneumococ-
