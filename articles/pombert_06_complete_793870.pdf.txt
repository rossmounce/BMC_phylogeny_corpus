Abstract
Background: The phylum Chlorophyta contains the majority of the green algae and is divided into four
classes. The basal position of the Prasinophyceae has been well documented, but the divergence order of
the Ulvophyceae, Trebouxiophyceae and Chlorophyceae is currently debated. The four complete
chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) sequences presently available for representatives of these classes have
revealed extensive variability in overall structure, gene content, intron composition and gene order. The
chloroplast genome of Pseudendoclonium (Ulvophyceae), in particular, is characterized by an atypical
quadripartite architecture that deviates from the ancestral type by a large inverted repeat (IR) featuring an
inverted rRNA operon and a small single-copy (SSC) region containing 14 genes normally found in the
large single-copy (LSC) region. To gain insights into the nature of the events that led to the reorganization
of the chloroplast genome in the Ulvophyceae, we have determined the complete cpDNA sequence of
Oltmannsiellopsis viridis, a representative of a distinct, early diverging lineage.
Results: The 151,933 bp IR-containing genome of Oltmannsiellopsis differs considerably from
Pseudendoclonium and other chlorophyte cpDNAs in intron content and gene order, but shares close
similarities with its ulvophyte homologue at the levels of quadripartite architecture, gene content and gene
density. Oltmannsiellopsis cpDNA encodes 105 genes, contains five group I introns, and features many short
dispersed repeats. As in Pseudendoclonium cpDNA, the rRNA genes in the IR are transcribed toward the
single copy region featuring the genes typically found in the ancestral LSC region, and the opposite single
copy region harbours genes characteristic of both the ancestral SSC and LSC regions. The 52 genes that
were transferred from the ancestral LSC to SSC region include 12 of those observed in Pseudendoclonium
cpDNA. Surprisingly, the overall gene organization of Oltmannsiellopsis cpDNA more closely resembles
that of Chlorella (Trebouxiophyceae) cpDNA.
Conclusion: The chloroplast genome of the last common ancestor of Oltmannsiellopsis and
Pseudendoclonium contained a minimum of 108 genes, carried only a few group I introns, and featured a
distinctive quadripartite architecture. Numerous changes were experienced by the chloroplast genome in
the lineages leading to Oltmannsiellopsis and Pseudendoclonium. Our comparative analyses of chlorophyte
cpDNAs support the notion that the Ulvophyceae is sister to the Chlorophyceae.

Background
The green algae are divided into the phyla Streptophyta
and Chlorophyta. The Streptophyta (sensu Bremer [1])
encompasses the algae from the class Charophyceae and
all land plants, whereas the Chlorophyta (sensu Sluiman
[2]) contains algae from the classes Prasinophyceae, Ulvophyceae, Trebouxiophyceae and Chlorophyceae [3]. The
basal position of the Prasinophyceae in the Chlorophyta
is generally well established, but the branching order of
the Ulvophyceae, Trebouxiophyceae and Chlorophyceae
(UTC) remains a matter of debate [4-6]. It has been proposed that a third lineage at the base of the Streptophyta
and Chlorophyta is represented by Mesostigma viride [7-9],
an alga traditionally classified within the prasinophytes.
This green plant lineage, however, is debated, as some
studies suggest that Mesostigma is an early offshoot of the
phylum Streptophyta [10-12].
Investigations of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) from green
algae representing each of the five recognized classes have
revealed that the genomes of the charophyte Chaetosphaeridium globosum [13] and the prasinophytes Mesostigma [7]
and Nephroselmis olivacea [14] are highly similar to those
of land plants. Like most land plants cpDNAs, these green
algal genomes are partitioned into a quadripartite architecture by two copies of a large inverted repeat (IR) separating small (SSC) and large (LSC) single copy regions.
Most notably, the great majority of the genes occupying a
given single copy region in prasinophyte genomes map to
the same single copy region in Chaetosphaeridium and land
plant cpDNAs. The increased structural stability of the
chloroplast genome conferred by the IR sequence has
been hypothesized to limit gene exchanges between the
SSC and LSC regions [15]. The IR region readily expands
or contracts and thus can easily gain or lose genes from the
neighbouring single copy regions through a process

known as the ebb and flow [16]. Despite its variable gene
content, the IR always features the ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
operon (rrs-I(gau)-A(ugc)-rrl-rrf) and this operon is
always transcribed toward the SSC region. In addition to
their characteristic pattern of gene partitioning, prasinophyte and streptophyte chloroplast genomes share a
number of features that were most probably inherited
from the progenitor of all green plant cpDNAs. First, they
have retained several gene clusters that date back to the
cyanobacterial ancestor of all chloroplasts. Second, their
genes are densely packed and their intergenic regions virtually lack short dispersed repeats (SDRs). Finally, with
128 to 137 genes, their gene repertoire is one of the largest
among green plant cpDNAs.
In contrast, the chloroplast genome has been substantially
reorganized in the UTC. The quadripartite architecture has
been lost from the genome of the trebouxiophyte Chlorella
vulgaris [17] following the disappearance of one copy of
the IR sequence. Although the quadripartite architecture
has been retained in the genome of the ulvophyte Pseudendoclonium akinetum [6], the IR sequence is atypical in featuring a rRNA operon transcribed towards the LSC region
[6]. In addition, the pattern of gene partitioning within
the SSC/LSC regions of Pseudendoclonium cpDNA deviates
significantly from those found in its prasinophyte and
land plant counterparts; the small single copy region of
this ulvophyte genome includes 14 genes that are usually
located within the LSC region. In the chlorophycean alga
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii [18], the two single copy
regions are similar in size and the genes are so thoroughly
scrambled that no distinction is possible between the SSC
and LSC regions. The Chlorella, Pseudendoclonium and
Chlamydomonas chloroplast genomes have lost many of
the ancestral gene clusters that are shared between Mesostigma and Nephroselmis cpDNAs, feature a reduced gene

content (from 94 genes in Chlamydomonas to 112 genes in
Chlorella) compared to prasinophyte and streptophyte
genomes, and contain SDRs in their intergenic regions.
The low density of coding sequences in these genomes is
explained not only by the smaller number of genes but
also by the expansion of intergenic regions. Moreover,
unlike Mesostigma and Nephroselmis cpDNAs, the chloroplast genomes of the three UTC algae have acquired group
I introns (from three in Chlorella to 27 in Pseudendoclonium) and group II introns (two in Chlamydomonas).

mannsiellopsis and Pseudendoclonium cpDNAs should
throw light into the chloroplast genome architecture of
the earliest diverging ulvophytes and, accordingly, into
the cpDNA changes that occurred in the separate lineages
leading to Oltmannsiellopsis and Pseudendoclonium. We
found that the IR-containing genome of Oltmannsiellopsis
differs considerably from its Pseudendoclonium and other
chlorophyte counterparts in intron content and gene
order, but shares closer similarities with Pseudendoclonium
cpDNA in terms of quadripartite architecture, gene content and gene density. In the context of the debate concerning the branching order of the UTC lineages, the
predicted architecture of the chloroplast genome of the
earliest members of the Ulvophyceae strengthens the
notion that this lineage is sister to the Chlorophyceae
[5,6].

To gain insights into the nature of the events that led to
the reorganization of the chloroplast genome in the Ulvophyceae, we have determined the complete cpDNA
sequence of Oltmannsiellopsis viridis. This marine unicellular green alga exhibits a counterclockwise arrangement of
basal bodies [19,20] and a single cup-shaped chloroplast
[20]. Previously classified in the Chlorophyceae [19,21],
Oltmannsiellopsis is currently considered to be the type species of the order Oltmannsiellopsidales (Ulvophyceae)
[22]. The Oltmannsiellopsidales have been shown to
branch at the base of the Ulvophyceae [4] and have been
used as outgroup for phylogenetic analyses of the Ulvophyceae [23-25]. Considering that Pseudendoclonium represents a distinct, early diverging lineage of the
Ulvophyceae (Ulotrichales, see supplementary Figure S1
in [6]), identification of the set of features common to Olt-

Mesostigma gene.
b The indicated size is derived from our unpublished sequence data. We found that a portion of the rpoA coding sequences is missing in

cpDNA but is significantly lower than those of the three
previously sequenced UTC genomes. The Oltmannsiellopsis
genome maps as a circular molecule of 151,933 bp (Figure 1) and contains 105 genes. Two copies of an IR
sequence of 18,510 bp, each encoding ten genes, are separated from one another by unequal single copy regions,
designated SC1 and SC2. Like other UTC cpDNAs, the Oltmannsiellopsis genome is less densely packed with coding
sequences than Mesostigma and Nephroselmis cpDNAs; at
59.2%, its density of coding sequences is similar to those
of Chlorella and Pseudendoclonium cpDNAs. Intergenic
spacers in Oltmannsiellopsis cpDNA feature SDRs and have
an average size of 512 bp, a value comparable to that
observed for Pseudendoclonium cpDNA (600 bp). A total of
five introns, all of which belong to the group I family,
were identified in Oltmannsiellopsis cpDNA.
Gene and intron contents
The gene content of Oltmannsiellopsis cpDNA is intermediate between those of Chlorella and Chlamydomonas cpDNAs (Table 1). Although Oltmannsiellopsis and
Pseudendoclonium cpDNAs encode the same number of

genes, these genomes differ slightly in their gene repertoire (Table 2). Oltmannsiellopsis cpDNA has retained all
three chl genes that are missing from Pseudendoclonium
cpDNA but has lost ycf62, trnL(caa) and trnR(ccg). Relative to Chlorella cpDNA, the genomes of Oltmannsiellopsis,
Pseudendoclonium and Chlamydomonas are missing a set of
five genes, i.e. cysA, cyst, and three tRNA genes (trnL(gag),
trnS(gga) and trnT(ggu)) (Table 2). The absence of three
genes (ycf62, trnL(caa) and trnR(ccg)) is uniquely shared
by Oltmannsiellopsis and Chlamydomonas cpDNAs, whereas
no specific gene loss is shared by Pseudendoclonium and
Chlamydomonas cpDNAs. Both Oltmannsiellopsis and Pseudendoclonium cpDNAs have retained the trnR(ccu) gene,
which is absent from all other completely sequenced chlorophyte cpDNAs.
As in the UTC chloroplast genomes previously investigated, the coding regions of several genes in Oltmannsiellopsis cpDNA are expanded relative to their Mesostigma
counterparts [6] (Table 3). However, most of the gene
expansions in Oltmannsiellopsis are less extensive than

Fragmented ancestral gene clusters in the cpDNAs of UTC algae
Fragmented ancestral gene clusters in the cpDNAs of UTC algae. The indicated clusters are found in both Mesostigma and Nephroselmis cpDNAs. Note that rpl22 has not been represented in the large ribosomal protein cluster because it
is present only in Mesostigma cpDNA (between rps19 and rps3). Sites of fragmentation are denoted by arrowheads of different
shades above the clusters: Chlamydomonas, filled arrowheads; Pseudendoclonium, dark grey arrowheads; Oltmannsiellopsis, light
grey arrowheads; and Chlorella, open arrowheads. Genes missing from Chlamydomonas, Pseudendoclonium, Oltmannsiellopsis and
Chlorella are indicated by squares, circles, asterisks and double dagger, respectively. Gene polarities are not shown.

introns, with the exception of the petB intron, are positionally and structurally homologous to previously
reported introns in green plant cpDNAs (Table 5). While
homologues of the Oltmannsiellopsis psbA intron are
present in Pseudendoclonium and Chlamydomonas, homologues of the three rrl introns are found in a larger diversity of green plants. Considering that these homologous
introns have been identified in UTC lineages, they could
have been inherited by vertical inheritance from the last
common ancestor of UTC algae; however, the finding that
they potentially code for homing endonucleases of the
LAGLIDADG or GIY-YIG families (Table 4) does not
allow us to exclude the possibility that they were acquired
by horizontal transfer. Although most of the 16 group I
introns in Pseudendoclonium cpDNA have no homologues
at identical cognate sites in other chloroplast genomes,
their close structural and sequence similarities together
with their absence from Oltmannsiellopsis cpDNA suggest
that they arose from intragenomic proliferation in the lineage leading to Pseudendoclonium [6]. Note that Blast
searches of the Oltmannsiellopsis petB intron sequence

against the GenBank database failed to detect any homologous intron in other organisms.
Genome structure and gene partitioning
The pattern of gene partitioning within the single copy
regions of Oltmannsiellopsis cpDNA differs substantially
from the ancestral partitioning pattern observed for Mesostigma, Nephroselmis and streptophyte cpDNAs (Figure
1). The great majority of the 30 genes found in the SC1
region of Oltmannsiellopsis are typically found in the
ancestral LSC region, whereas the SC2 region contains 52
genes characteristic of the ancestral LSC region in addition
to ten genes characteristic of the ancestral SSC region.
Interestingly, SC2 includes 12 of the 14 LSC genes that
have been transferred to the SSC region in Pseudendoclonium cpDNA. The two exceptional Pseudendoclonium
genes that have no homologues in Oltmannsiellopsis SC2
are trnH(gug) and trnL(caa); the trnH(gug) gene resides in
the SC1 region of Oltmannsiellopsis, whereas trnL(caa) has
been lost from Oltmannsiellopsis cpDNA. Considering the
gene contents of the Oltmannsiellopsis single copy regions,

mannsiellopsis is similar in size to that of Chlamydomonas
(Table 1). Both IR junctions in Oltmannsiellopsis cpDNA
encompass genes (cemA and ftsH) of which the coding
sequences expand into the single copy regions. As in the
Pseudendoclonium IR, the Oltmannsiellopsis rRNA genes are
transcribed towards the single copy region carrying the
genes that map to the LSC in prasinophyte and streptophyte cpDNAs. In contrast, the rRNA operon is transcribed toward the SSC region in Nephroselmis and
streptophyte cpDNAs. The orientation of the rRNA
operon cannot be established in Chlamydomonas cpDNA
owing to the extensively scrambled single copy regions,
and this orientation remains unknown in Chlorella
cpDNA because of the IR loss.

it appears inappropriate to label these regions according
to their sizes. Although SC1 is smaller than SC2, it likely
corresponds to the ancestral LSC region, and SC2 is apparently derived from the ancestral SSC region.

Considering that Oltmannsiellopsis and Pseudendoclonium
represent distinct, early diverging lineages of the Ulvophyceae, the striking similarities between the quadripartite
architectures
of
Oltmannsiellopsis
and
Pseudendoclonium cpDNAs suggest that both the atypical
gene partitioning pattern and unusual orientation of the
IR were characteristic of the chloroplast genome of earliest-diverging ulvophytes. Our data predict that the SSC
region of the last common ancestor of Oltmannsiellopsis
and Pseudendoclonium cpDNAs featured 12 of the genes
usually found in the LSC region in Nephroselmis and streptophyte cpDNAs, whereas the LSC region contained exclusively genes characteristic of the ancestral LSC region.
Consequently, in the lineage leading to Pseudendoclonium,
two extra genes were transferred to the SSC region,
whereas 40 additional genes migrated to this region in the
Oltmannsiellopsis lineage. Although the mechanisms
underlying these gene migrations between single copy
regions remain unknown, they probably involved
intramolecular or intermolecular recombination events.
The analysis of conserved gene clusters reported below
clearly indicates that several genes were transferred
together in the course of these migrations.

The IR sequence in Oltmannsiellopsis cpDNA is about 12
kb larger than that in Pseudendoclonium cpDNA and contains five genes in addition to those found in the rRNA
operon (Figure 1). At 18,510 bp, the IR sequence of Olt-

Genes have been more extensively shuffled between the
two single copy regions in Chlamydomonas cpDNA (Figure
1). It can be envisioned that during the evolution of ulvophytes and chlorophycean green algae, the ancestral pat-

tern of gene partitioning was disrupted in successive steps,
with a Pseudendoclonium-like organization evolving into
an Oltmannsiellopsis-like organization, leading ultimately
to the extensive scrambling of genes observed in
Chlamydomonas. Given the absence of the IR from the
Chlorella genome, it is very difficult to ascertain whether
the transcription direction of the rRNA operon changed
and whether genes were relocated from one genomic
region to another during the evolution of trebouxiophytes. Loss of the IR is usually associated with many gene
rearrangements [15]; in the case of Chlorella cpDNA, however, all the genes usually found in the ancestral SSC
region have remained clustered, with the exception of
three genes (psaC, ycf20 and trnL(uag)) (Figure 1). Investigations of IR-containing chloroplast genomes from distinct trebouxiophyte lineages will be required to test
whether some of the gene relocations identified here in
both Oltmannsiellopsis and Pseudendoclonium cpDNAs
originated from the common ancestor of UTC algae.
Gene clustering
The overall gene organization of Oltmannsiellopsis cpDNA
differs extensively from that of its Pseudendoclonium
homologue and, surprisingly, more closely resembles that
of Chlorella cpDNA (Figure 2). Oltmannsiellopsis and Chlo-

rella cpDNAs share 21 blocks of colinear sequences that
contain a total of 65 genes, whereas Oltmannsiellopsis and
Pseudendoclonium cpDNAs have in common 18 blocks
containing 55 genes. Only eight blocks containing 19
genes are conserved in the Oltmannsiellopsis and
Chlamydomonas genomes.
Many of the 24 ancestral gene clusters shared by Mesostigma and Nephroselmis cpDNAs have been disrupted
during the evolution of the UTC green algae. In this study,
we have analyzed 19 ancestral clusters; the five remaining
ones could not be investigated because the genes they
contain have been lost from UTC cpDNAs (Figure 3). All
19 clusters have been broken at least in one occasion during the evolution of the UTC algae. With only 12 breakpoints, Chlorella cpDNA displays the strongest
conservation of ancestral clusters. With 20 breakpoints,
Oltmannsiellopsis cpDNA occupies a median position
between Chlorella and Pseudendoclonium (24 breakpoints)
cpDNAs, whereas Chlamydomonas cpDNA reveals twice as
many breakpoints (42 breakpoints). The Chlamydomonas,
Oltmannsiellopsis and Pseudendoclonium genomes share
five breakpoints that are missing in Chlorella cpDNA.
Aside from these breakpoints, Pseudendoclonium and
Chlamydomonas cpDNAs share six breakpoints that are

absent from Oltmannsiellopsis and Chlorella cpDNAs. There
is no breakpoint exclusive to the Oltmannsiellopsis and
Chlamydomonas genomes.
Two ancestral clusters display breakpoints that are unique
to the Ulvophyceae. The almost universally conserved
psbB-psbT-psbN-psbH cluster was fragmented at the 5' end
of psbN, creating two separate pieces, each encoding a pair
of genes, in Oltmannsiellopsis cpDNA. In the Pseudendoclonium lineage, the introduction of an additional breakpoint on the opposite side of psbN led to the relocation of
this gene on the DNA strand encoding psbB, psbT and
psbH, without any change in gene order. In the Oltmannsiellopsis lineage, three breakpoints occurred in the
ancestral rRNA operon to generate a new transcription
unit in which the order of the trnA(ugc) and trnI(gau)
genes has been reversed. Rearranged rRNA operons have
been reported for the cpDNAs of the trebouxiophyte Chlorella ellipsoidea [26] and the ulvophyte Codium fragile [27];
however, in these cases, the ancestral rRNA operon was
split into separate fragments that are transcribed from different promoters.
In terms of derived gene clusters, Oltmannsiellopsis cpDNA
is most similar to Chlorella cpDNA (Figure 4). A derived
cluster is defined here as a group of genes with the same
relative polarities in two or more UTC genomes, but
absent from Mesostigma and Nephroselmis cpDNAs. Oltmannsiellopsis cpDNA shares five derived clusters with its
Chlorella homologue, whereas Pseudendoclonium cpDNA
shares three clusters, one of which is missing from Oltmannsiellopsis. Of the four derived clusters common to Oltmannsiellopsis and Pseudendoclonium cpDNAs, none is
found in Chlamydomonas cpDNA.
We estimated that a minimum of 50 inversions would be
required to transform the gene organization of Oltmannsiellopsis cpDNA into that of any other chlorophyte
genome (Table 6). Comparative analyses of cpDNAs from
land plants [15] and from closely related chlamydomonads [28,29] suggest that inversions represent the predom-

inant mechanism of chloroplast genome rearrangements
in green plants. However, inversions might be not the
only mutational events causing gene order changes in
chlorophytes cpDNAs, as transpositions have been proposed to account for some of the rearrangements
observed in Campanulaceae [30] and in subclover [31]
cpDNAs.
Repeated elements
A large number of SDR elements are found in Oltmannsiellopsis cpDNA (Figure 5). Although these elements reside
predominantly within intergenic spacers and introns, a
few copies populate the coding regions of cemA, chlB, chlL,
chlN, ftsH, rpoB, rpoC1 and rpoC2. The most abundant elements can be classified into five groups of non-overlapping repeat units (A through E) on the basis of their
primary sequences (Table 7). Their sizes range from 7–21
bp and their copy numbers vary from 17 to more than
250. The sequence of repeat unit A or B is most often
linked to the reverse complement of the same sequence,
thus forming perfect palindromes or putative stem-loop
structures with a loop of two A or two T (Figure 6). In
some instances, the palindromes or stem portions of the
stem-loop structures are extended by the addition of less
frequent repeats. Furthermore, a few copies of repeat units
A and B occur as solitary sequences, representing probably
degenerated versions of the more common arrangements
featuring palindromes or stem-loop structures. Repeat
unit C can form stem-loop structures, with a loop of variable size. Although repeat units D and E are not associated
with stem-loop structures, they reside in the vicinity of
other repeated elements.

The SDRs in Oltmannsiellopsis cpDNA do not closely
resemble those present in other UTC cpDNAs. The Oltmannsiellopsis repeats are biased in G+C, whereas the
Chlorella repeats show a bias in A+T. The Pseudendoclonium and Chlamydomonas SDRs are also rich in G+C,
but their sequences share no obvious similarities with the
Oltmannsiellopsis repeats. This lack of sequence similarities between SDRs derived from distinct UTC genomes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/4/3

clonium cpDNA (Figure 7) and genes have been rearranged
to a similar extent in both genomes (Table 6). SDRs in
green plant cpDNAs could serve as hot spots for nonhomologous recombinational events and lead to inversions
and transpositions [15,30,31].

Conclusion
Although the Oltmannsiellopsis chloroplast genome differs
considerably from its Pseudendoclonium counterpart at the
levels of intron content and gene order, the two ulvophyte
genomes share similarities in gene content and quadripartite architecture. We conclude that the chloroplast
genome of the last common ancestor of Oltmannsiellopsis
and Pseudendoclonium contained a minimum of 108
genes, was loosely packed with coding sequences, carried
only a few group I introns, and featured a quadripartite
architecture that deviates from the ancestral type displayed by Mesostigma and Nephroselmis cpDNAs with
regard to the transcription direction of the rRNA genes
and the gene contents of the single copy regions. Given
the phylogenetic positions of Oltmannsiellopsis and Pseudendoclonium, these genomic characters were undoubtedly
present in the earliest-diverging members of the Ulvophyceae. Numerous changes were experienced by the
chloroplast genome in the lineages leading to Oltmannsiellopsis and Pseudendoclonium; these include contraction/
expansion of the IR, migration of genes from the ancestral
LSC region toward the single copy region corresponding
to the SSC, gene losses, intron gains/losses, and gene rearrangements within the IR and each of the single copy
regions. Considering that the chloroplast genome of
Codium fragile (Ulvales) is greatly reduced in size (only 89
kbp) and lacks an IR [27], many additional chloroplast
gene losses and rearrangements probably occurred in
some lineages of the Ulvophyceae.

suggests that SDRs have been acquired independently in
UTC lineages. However, the alternative hypothesis that
SDRs were transmitted vertically cannot be excluded if we
assume that these elements evolve at a very fast pace. Studies of cpDNAs from closely related UTC taxa will be
required to distinguish between these two hypotheses.
SDRs have most probably played a major role in remodelling the chloroplast genome in UTC lineages. A correlation has been previously observed between the
abundance of SDRs and the extent of gene rearrangements
in UTC algal genomes [6]. This correlation still holds with
the addition of Oltmannsiellopsis chloroplast genome
sequence. The abundance of SDR elements in Oltmannsiellopsis cpDNA is comparable to that observed in Pseudendo-

Our comparative analysis of the Oltmannsiellopsis chloroplast genome with its chlorophyte counterparts strengthens the idea that the chloroplast genomes of earlydiverging ulvophytes occupy an intermediate position
between those of the trebouxiophyte Chlorella and the
chlorophycean green alga Chlamydomonas with respect to
the retention of ancestral features [6]. In the context of the
debate on the branching order of UTC lineages [4-6], this
analysis provides further support for the published phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial gene sequences identifying the Trebouxiophyceae as a basal lineage relative to the
Ulvophyceae and Chlorophyceae [5].

previously [5]. Sequences were edited and assembled with
SEQUENCHER 4.2.1 (GeneCodes, Ann Arbor, MI). The
fully annotated chloroplast genome sequence has been
deposited in [GenBank:DQ291132].
Sequence analyses
Genes and ORFs were identified as described previously
[6]. Homologous introns were detected by BLASTN
searches [33] against the non-redundant database of
National Center for Biotechnology Information using an
E value threshold of 1 × 10-4. Homologous introns
inserted at identical positions within the same gene were
identified by manual screening of the GOBASE database
[34].

Repeated sequences were mapped with PipMaker [35],
identified with REPuter 2.74 [36] and classified with
REPEATFINDER [37], using the default parameters.
Sequences clustered with REPEATFINDER were aligned
manually using BIOEDIT 7.0.1 [38], and non-overlapping
SDR units were identified by manual screening of the
alignment. Numbers of SDR units were determined with
FINDPATTERNS of the GCG Wisconsin Package version
10.2 (Accelrys, Burlington, Mass.), using 100% or 90%
sequence identity. Putative stem-loop structures and
degenerate repeats were identified using PALINDROME
and ETANDEM in EMBOSS 2.9.0 [39], respectively. The
density of repeated elements in a given chloroplast
genome was assessed with REPuter 2.74 [36] using the -f

(forward), -p (palindromic), and -allmax options at minimum lengths (-l) of 30 bp and 45 bp. For the analyses
involving IR-containing genomes, one copy of the IR
sequence was deleted. Circle graphs generated by REPuter
were screen-captured at 300 dpi and converted to black
and white illustrations with GIMP 2.0 [40]. Repeated elements in different cpDNAs were compared using Vmatch
[41] and GenAlyzer 0.81 b [42].
The GRIMM web server [43] was used to infer the minimal
number of gene permutations by inversions in pairwise
comparisons of chloroplast genomes. Because GRIMM
cannot deal with duplicated genes and requires that the
compared genomes have the same gene content, genes
within one of the two copies of the IR were excluded and
only the genes common to all the compared genomes
were analysed. The data set used in the comparative analyses reported in Table 6 contained 90 genes; the three
exons of the trans-spliced psaA gene were coded as distinct
fragments (for a total of 92 gene loci).
