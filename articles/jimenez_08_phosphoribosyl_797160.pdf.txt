Abstract
Background: Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) is a central compound for cellular
metabolism and may be considered as a link between carbon and nitrogen metabolism. PRPP is
directly involved in the de novo and salvage biosynthesis of GTP, which is the immediate precursor
of riboflavin. The industrial production of this vitamin using the fungus Ashbya gossypii is an
important biotechnological process that is strongly influenced by substrate availability.
Results: Here we describe the characterization and manipulation of two genes of A. gossypii
encoding PRPP synthetase (AGR371C and AGL080C). We show that the AGR371C and AGL080C
gene products participate in PRPP synthesis and exhibit inhibition by ADP. We also observed a
major contribution of AGL080C to total PRPP synthetase activity, which was confirmed by an
evident growth defect of the Δagl080c strain. Moreover, we report the overexpression of wildtype and mutant deregulated isoforms of Agr371cp and Agl080cp that significantly enhanced the
production of riboflavin in the engineered A. gossypii strains.
Conclusion: It is shown that alterations in PRPP synthetase activity have pleiotropic effects on the
fungal growth pattern and that an increase in PRPP synthetase enzymatic activity can be used to
enhance riboflavin production in A. gossypii.

Background
Ashbya gossypii is a filamentous hemiascomycete, which
has been considered a paradigm of sustainable "white"
biotechnology through its use in the industrial overproduction of riboflavin and other vitamins [1]. During the
late growth phase, when maximum biomass has been
reached, A. gossypii naturally exhibits high levels of riboflavin production as a detoxifying and protective mechanism [2]. However, we have recently described that
riboflavin production can be enhanced considerably by
genetic and metabolic engineering of the purine pathway,

which provides the precursor for riboflavin biosynthesis
[3,4].
Riboflavin is synthesized from GTP and ribulose 5-phosphate through a multi-step pathway controlled by the RIB
genes (RIB1 to RIB5 and RIB7 in A. gossypii) [5]. GTP, the
immediate precursor for riboflavin production, is synthesized through the de novo purine pathway (Figure 1),
which starts with the formation of PRPP. Alternatively,
GTP can be formed through the purine salvage pathways
(Figure 1), which recycle purines with the consumption of
PRPP [6].

Figure 1
Metabolic contribution of PRPP to the purine biosynthesis and other anabolic pathways
Metabolic contribution of PRPP to the purine biosynthesis and other anabolic pathways. The purine pathway is
shaded; the de novo purine pathway starts with PRPP biosynthesis, while salvage pathways use PRPP to transform purine bases
to monophosphate nucleotides. Dashed arrows indicate a multi-step pathway; sAMP, adenylosuccinate.
PRPP, synthesized from ribose-5-phosphate and ATP, is
therefore a key compound for purine and riboflavin biosynthesis, and it is also an important cellular metabolite
because it represents a link between carbon and nitrogen
metabolism. PRPP is a biosynthetic precursor of histidine
and tryptophan, and it is also required for the de novo and
salvage pathways of purine, pyrimidine and pyridine
(NAD+, NADP+) nucleotides. It has been calculated that
approximately 80% of the metabolic flux through PRPP is
directed to purine and pyrimidine synthesis [7].
The formation of PRPP is catalyzed by the enzyme PRPP
synthetase, which is encoded by PRS genes. It has been
shown that mutations in human PRS genes can either activate or inactivate the enzyme, leading to different hereditary disorders including hyperucemia, mental retardation,
developmental delay, and other neurological pathologies
[8-11].
According to the Ashbya Genome Database (AGD, http://
agd.vital-it.ch/index.html) [12] there are four putative
annotated genes encoding PRPP synthetase in A. gossypii.
In constrast, Saccharomyeces cerevisiae is equipped with a
set of five unlinked PRS genes (PRS1-PRS5) [13,14]. Thus,
in S. cerevisiae PRPP synthetase is organized in two interacting complexes or functional entities: a heterodimer
comprising Prs1p-Prs3p; and a heterotrimer consisting of
Prs2p-Prs4p-Prs5p [15]. Furthermore, systematic analyses

of all possible combinations of PRS deletions in S. cerevisiae have revealed three possible phenotypes: synthetic
lethality, when PRS1 or PRS3 deletions are combined with
a disruption in PRS5, and the simultaneous deletion of
PRS2 and PRS4 in either the Δprs1 or Δprs3 strains. A second phenotype is characterized by growth impairment
and reduced enzymatic activity; this phenotype is found
in mutants containing disruptions in PRS1 and PRS3,
either together or in combination with Δprs2 or Δprs4.
Finally a third phenotype, which only consists of a reduction in enzymatic activity, is encountered in single or
combined deletions of PRS2, PRS4 and PRS5. This complex scenario can be explained in terms of the existence of
three minimal subunits capable of sustaining the required
PRPP intracellular pool in S. cerevisiae: namely, Prs1-Prs3;
Prs2-Prs5 and Prs4-Prs5 [15].
Based on their enzymatic properties, so far three classes of
PRPP synthetases have been described: Class I PRPP synthetases, which are dependent on phosphate ions for
activity, are inhibited by purine ribonucleotide diphosphates and exclusively use either ATP or dATP as a diphosphoryl donors. PRPP synthetases from Escherichia coli, S.
cerevisiae and mammals belong to class I [16-18]. Class II
enzymes are specific from plants and are characterized by
their independence of phosphate ions, their lack of allosteric inhibition, and their broad specificity for diphosphoryl donors [19]. Finally, a class III enzyme has recently

BMC Biotechnology 2008, 8:67

been described in the archaeon Methanocaldococcus jannaschii, which is activated by phosphate and uses ATP as
diphosphoryl donor, but lacks an allosteric site for ADP
[20]. In a recent publication, a novel allosteric site for
SO42-, whose residues are strictly conserved in eukaryotic
class I enzymes has been reported to stabilize the active
site of PRPP synthetase [21].
Here we report the characterization of AGR371C and
AGL080C genes encoding PRPP synthetases from A. gossypii and their effects on riboflavin production and
growth. We found that PRPP synthetases from A. gossypii
are inhibited by ADP. Furthermore, by combining AgPRS
gene deletions we were able to define three different phenotypes that mimicked those previously encountered in
yeast Δprs mutants. Finally, we describe the metabolic
engineering of A. gossypii strains whose PRPP synthetase
regulatory properties have been modified to significantly
enhance the productivity of riboflavin.

Methods
Strains, media and techniques for A. gossypii culture
The A. gossypii ATCC 10895 strain was used and was considered as a wild-type strain. A. gossypii was cultured at
28°C using MA2 rich medium [22], synthetic complete
media [23] or synthetic minimal media [24]. A concentration of 250 μg/ml of geneticin (G418) (Sigma, Steinheim,
Germany), or 200 μg/ml of hygromycin B (Phytotechnology Laboratories, Shawnee Mission, USA), was used when
specified. A. gossypii transformation, genomic DNA and
RNA isolation, Southern-blot and northern-blot analyses,
spores isolation, cell protein extraction, and HPLC determination of total riboflavin contents were carried out as
previously described [24,25].
PCR-based cloning of AGR371C and AGL080C genes from
A. gossypii
Based on the annotated sequences for AGR371C and
AGL080C in the AGD database http://agd.vital-it.ch/
index.html[12], two pairs of primers were designed to
PCR-amplify two genomic regions (approx. 3 Kb each)
containing AGR371C- and AGL080C- coding DNA
sequences. Both genomic fragments were cloned into a
pBluescript-SK+ vector (Stratagene) as KpnI-HindIII
(AGR371C) and EcoRI (AGL080C) fragments respectively.
The resulting clones were shown to be correct by DNA
sequencing of the entire fragments (data not shown).
AGR371C and AGL080C gene disruption and
overexpression
For AGR371C and AGL080C disruption, an integration
cassette was constructed for each ORF (see below for further details). Briefly, for AGR371C disruption we obtained
a kanMX4 selection module for geneticin resistance
(G418r) with SalI ends from the plasmid pAG-110 [26],

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6750/8/67

which were subsequently treated with Klenow enzyme
(Roche) to generate blunt ends. The kanMX4 blunt-ended
fragment was inserted between HincII and EcoRV sites in
the AGR371C ORF. The complete replacement module
was obtained by digestion with NcoI and KpnI and was
used to transform spores of the A. gossypii ATCC 10895
strain. For AGL080C disruption, a hygromycin resistance
(Hygr) marker was obtained with BamHI-KpnI ends, which
were subsequently treated with Klenow enzyme (Roche).
The resulting Hygr marker was inserted between two EcoRV
sites present in the AGL080C ORF. Finally, the AGL080C
disruption module was obtained by EcoRI digestion and
was used to transform either spores of the A. gossypii ATCC
10895 strain, for the single disruption, or spores of the A.
gossypii Δagr371c strain, for the double disruption. Correct
integrations were verified by analytical PCR and Southern-blotting experiments.
For the overexpression of different alleles of AGR371C
and AGL080C, each ORF was inserted as an NdeI-BamHI
fragment into the overexpression cassette described
below. Briefly, the overexpression cassette comprised: (i)
a selection module for geneticin resistance, (ii) an integration module for stable integration of the cassette into the
AgLEU2 locus, and finally (iii) an overexpression module
based on the AgGPD promoter and terminator sequences,
which have been reported to provide constitutive and
high expression levels [3]. The overexpression modules
were used to transform spores of the A. gossypii ATCC
10895 strain and positive clones were selected in media
containing geneticin. Additionally, positive clones were
verified for their leucine auxotrophy and analyzed by
Southern-blotting.
PRPP synthetase activity assay
A method previously described by Jensen et al. [27] was
used for the quantification of PRPP synthetase activity. We
measured the conversion of 32P-labelled ATP into 32Plabelled PRPP according to the following reaction:
32P-ATP

+ ribose 5-P → 32P-PRPP + AMP

The reaction mix contained 50 mM potassium phosphate,
pH 7.5, 1 mM [γ-32P] ATP (10 Ci/mmol), 50 mM triethanolamine, 5 mM ribose 5-P, 5 mM MgCl2, 20 mM NaF,
15 mM phosphoenolpyruvate and 1 μmol/min of pyruvate kinase. We used 5–10 mg of total protein extract and
the reaction was incubated at 28°C, taking 10 μl aliquots
every 5 min over 1 hour. Samples were mixed with 5 μl of
0.33 M formic acid and immediately applied to a polyethylenimine-cellulose-coated plate (Sigma-Aldrich) for
thin-layer chromatography. Separation of radiolabeled
ATP and PRPP was carried out in 0.85 M potassium phosphate, pH 3.4. The radiolabeled spots corresponding to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6750/8/67

ATP and PRPP were cut and the associated radioactivity
was quantified by liquid scintillation counting methods.
Site-directed mutagenesis of AGR371C and AGL080C and
inhibition of PRPP synthetase
Residue substitutions in the AGR371C and AGL080C
ORFs were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis
through PCR techniques using the primers listed in the
Additional file 1. The inhibition assays were performed
with different concentrations of ADP in the PRPP synthetase activity analyses. The inhibition rate was calculated as the percentage of specific activity in the presence
of ADP with reference to the absence of ADP.

Results
Cloning and sequence analysis of the AGR371C and
AGL080C genes from A. gossypii
We have previously shown that substrate availability is a
limiting factor for riboflavin overproduction in A. gossypii
and that increases in metabolic flux through the purine
pathway significantly enhance riboflavin production
[3,4,28]. PRPP is an important metabolite for purine biosynthesis because it is required in both the de novo and salvage pathways. This prompted us to wonder whether
alterations in the PRPP intracellular pool might affect
riboflavin production in A. gossypii.

In the AGD database there are four annotated genes
encoding PRPP synthetase in A. gossypii that are syntenic
homologues of the PRS genes from S. cerevisiae. A protein
sequence alignment of A. gossypii and S. cerevisiae PRPP
synthetases revealed a high degree of similarity (see Additional file 2). Furthermore, AGR371C is an ortholog of
ScPRS2 and ScPRS4, suggesting that AGR371C is a common ancestor of both ScPRS2 and ScPRS4, which probably originated in a gene duplication event (Fig. 2). Thus,
in accordance with the PRPP synthetase interacting complexes described in S. cerevisiae [15], we assumed that two
homologous heterodimers might exist in A. gossypii,
formed by Aer083cp-Agl080cp and Agr371cp-Adr314cp.
In order to study the specific contribution of each heterodimer to the overall PRPP synthetase activity and also
to the production of riboflavin, for our next experiments
we chose one member of each functional entity
(AGR371C and AGL080C). For simplicity, AGR371C and
AGL080C are henceforth referred to as PRS2,4 and PRS3,
respectively, due to their homology with the S. cerevisiae
PRS genes.
We amplified by PCR and cloned two genomic regions
where PRS2,4 and PRS3 map and sequenced them. In
good agreement with the nucleotide sequence deposited
in the AGD database [12], PRS2,4 ORF comprised 957 bp
encoding a protein of 318 amino acids, and PRS3 ORF

consisted of 963 bp and coded for a protein of 320 amino
acids. Both the Prs2,4 and Prs3 proteins contained most
of the residues identified as being essential for catalysis,
the maintenance of three-dimensional structure or protein-protein interactions in previously characterized PRPP
synthetases [21,29] (see Additional file 2 for details).
Analysis of the 5'-non coding regions of AgPRS2,4 and
AgPRS3 using the MatInspector program included in the
GenomatixSuite 3.1.1 software http://www.genom
atix.de/ unveiled several TATA boxes (not shown) and,
more importantly, one putative binding site for the transcription activator Bas1p in both the AgPRS2,4 and
AgPRS3 sequences (positions -38 and -197 from ATG,
respectively) (not shown). However, our previous work
demonstrated that the expression of AgPRS2,4 and
AgPRS3 is unaffected upon AgBAS1 deletion, suggesting
that the presence of only one binding site is not sufficient
to ensure transcriptional regulation by Bas1p [4].
AgPRS2,4 and AgPRS3 gene disruptions affects PRPP
synthetase activity and growth
In order to elucidate the precise contribution of AgPRS2,4
and AgPRS3 to the overall PRPP synthetase activity in A.
gossypii, we next disrupted both genes by inserting a dominant marker into each ORF. We used a kanMX4 selection
module for geneticin resistance (G418r) to disrupt
AgPRS2,4 and an hygromycin resistance (Hygr) marker to
disrupt AgPRS3 (Fig. 3). The final disruption modules
comprised the G418r or Hygr selection cassettes flanked by
the AgPRS2,4 or AgPRS3 sequences, respectively, to enable
homologous recombination and genomic insertion [30]
(Fig. 3). With the disruption modules A. gossypii ATCC

Southern-blot analysis using specific radiolabeled probes

None of the Δprs mutants showed any nutritional requirement, confirming that the intracellular PRPP pool in both
mutants was sufficient to support growth. Nevertheless,
while the mutant agΔprs2,4 did not show any visible phenotype when grown on solid media, the agΔprs3 strain
revealed a clear growth alteration, exhibiting myceliumcondensed and smaller colonies (Fig. 4). In addition,

Growth pattern of Δprs2,4 and Δprs3 mutant strains. Left, A. gossypii wild-type and prs mutant strains were grown in liquid MA2 rich medium. At the indicated time-points, mycelia were harvested and weighed. Data are represented as an average
of mycelium dry-weight per volume of culture. Error bars represent SD. Right, colony photographs of the wild-type, Δprs2,4
and Δprs3 strains grown on solid MA2 rich medium during 48 hours.

agΔprs3 displayed a significant reduction in the sporulation ability, this being 10-fold lower than that of the wildtype strain. We therefore analyzed liquid cultures of both
agΔprs2,4 and agΔprs3 and determined the mycelial mass
produced along growth. After four days of culture, the
agΔprs3 strain displayed an initial growth delay with
respect to the wild-type, although after 24 hours of culture
its biomass was higher than that of the wild-type strain
(Fig. 4).
Next we wished to examine the growth alteration of
agΔprs3 strain in greater detail by microscopic analysis.
Again, agΔprs2,4 and wild-type strains were indistinguishable from each other, both of them showing an initial
monopolar hyphal growth and a later bipolar growth,
with branched hyphae (Fig. 5). Conversely, Δprs3 disruption caused a shortening on the hyphal length, and an
abundant early branching was observed (Fig. 5). This
higher branching index could explain the condensed mycelia of the agΔprs3 strain observed on solid media.
PRPP synthetase activity was altered in both agΔprs2,4 and
agΔprs3 strains, but disruption of PRS3 resulted in a more
marked decrease in the overall enzymatic activity, which
in the agΔprs3 strain represented only 14% of the PRPP

synthetase activity observed in the wild-type strain. Furthermore, riboflavin production was also partially
impaired in the agΔprs3 mutant (Table 1). Taken together,
these results suggest a major contribution of the PRS3 paralog to PRPP synthetase activity.
In order to obtain a Δprs2,4-Δprs3 double mutant, spores
of the Δprs2,4 strain were transformed with the Δprs3 disruption cassette described above. Selection of primary heterokaryotic clones was made in rich medium containing
both geneticin and hygromycin. However, after clonal
analysis of 200 homokaryotic strains derived from the
previous heterokaryotic clones we failed to find any
mutant strain showing resistance to both geneticin and
hygromycin, suggesting that the double disruption of
PRS2,4 and PRS3 may result in a synthetic lethal phenotype. To verify this hypothesis, we analyzed the initial heterokaryotic transformants (G418r and Hygr) by Southernblotting and confirmed the presence of both single disruptant Δprs2,4 nuclei and double mutant Δprs2,4-Δprs3
nuclei (not shown). However, none of the homokaryotic
transformants analyzed showed the double Δprs2,4-Δprs3
disruption. Additionally, the spores of the heterokaryotic
Δprs2,4-Δprs3/Δprs2,4 were isolated by micromanipulation and analyzed individually; the same results described

above were obtained. Apparently, the PRPP synthetase
activity provided by Δprs2,4 nuclei is sufficient to maintain an adequate pool of PRPP and to allow the survival of
the heterokaryotic transformants.

AgPRS2,4 and AgPRS3 overexpression enhances riboflavin
production
In a recent paper we reported that PRS2,4 and PRS3
mRNA levels did not change during the trophic and productive phases of A. gossypii growth. Furthermore, PRS2,4

and PRS3 show constitutive low expression levels, suggesting a housekeeping function of these genes [4].
We therefore decided to strongly enhance the expression
of PRS2,4 and PRS3 and analyze the effect of their overexpression on riboflavin production. Accordingly, we
designed a stable overexpression cassette based on the
promoter and terminator sequences of AgGPD (see Materials and Methods for details) (Fig. 6). This cassette allows
stable genomic integration into the AgLEU2 locus and
selection for G418r. PRS2,4 and PRS3 ORFs were PCRamplified as NdeI-BamHI fragments and were inserted
into the overexpression module. Following this, the final
constructs were used to transform spores of the A. gossypii
ATCC 10895 strain and heterokaryotic transformants
were selected in medium containing geneticin. After
sporulation and clonal selection, homokaryotic G418r

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6750/8/67

transformants were obtained and checked for their leucine auxotrophy. Additionally, integration into the
AgLEU2 locus of each overexpression cassette was confirmed by Southern-blotting (Fig. 6).
Transcriptional analysis of the GPD-PRS2,4 and GPDPRS3 strains by northern-blotting revealed that mRNA
levels of both genes were increased by 30-fold (Fig. 6).
However, the increase in PRPP synthetase activity did not
correlate with the transcriptional levels (see Table 1), suggesting a regulatory mechanism of the enzymatic activity,
as described for other PRPP synthetases [16-18]. Nevertheless, when we quantified the riboflavin yield of the
strains overexpressing PRS2,4 and PRS3 we observed a significant improvement in the riboflavin production of
both strains (Table 1).

Discussion

The functionality of the amino acid substitutions were
analyzed by PRPP synthetase enzymatic assays in the
prs2,4-IQ and prs3-IQ mutant strains, testing the inhibitory effect of different concentrations of ADP. As shown in
figure 6, PRPP synthetase activity was strongly inhibited
by ADP in the GPD-PRS2,4 and GPD-PRS3 strains, while
the PRPP synthetase activity of the strains carrying the
mutant isoforms prs2,4-IQ and prs3-IQ was highly refractory to the inhibitory effect of ADP. Finally, we analyzed
the production of riboflavin in the prs2,4-IQ and prs3-IQ
strains to compare it with that obtained in the wild-type
and also in the strains overexpressing the wild-type
PRS2,4 and PRS3 genes. Both strains harboring the deregulated prs2,4-IQ and prs3-IQ attained fairly high production levels, with an 80% greater riboflavin yield than the
wild-type strain (Fig. 7). However, riboflavin production
did not increase substantially in the prs2,4-IQ and prs3-IQ
strains with respect to the yield obtained after the overexpression of the wild-type alleles, suggesting that other regulatory mechanisms may affect the PRPP intracellular
pool and riboflavin production.

We therefore designed mutagenic primers (see Additional
file 1) to introduce two point mutations in both PRS2,4
and PRS3 genes. The amino acid substitutions carried out
were as follows: the leucines at positions 133 and 132 in
Prs2,4 and Prs3, respectively, were substituted by an isoleucine; and the histidines at positions 196 and 195 in
Prs2,4 and Prs3 proteins were changed to glutamine. As
previously mentioned, both transversions have been
reported to cause PRPP synthetase superactivity in
humans [9]. After we had amplified the mutant prs2,4 and
prs3 ORFs by mutagenic PCR, we cloned the mutant alleles (prs2,4-IQ and prs3-IQ) in the overexpression cassette
described above and followed the same strategy to integrate them into the AgLEU2 locus. Correct genomic integrations in homokaryotic transformants were verified by
Southern-blotting (not shown).

Effect of enzymatic deregulation of AgPRS2,4 and AgPRS3
PRPP synthetases are subject to feed-back regulation by
ADP. Furthermore, the amino acids directly involved in
inhibitor binding have been elucidated in several PRPP
synthetases [21,29] and it has been reported that specific
subtitutions of the leucine 128 and histidine 192 residues
of human PRS1 induce allosteric deregulation and
enzyme superactivity [9]. In the A. gossypii Prs2,4 and Prs3
proteins, those residues are strictly conserved and correspond to leucines 133 and 132; and histidines 196 and
195 in the Prs2,4 and Prs3 proteins respectively.

are means of three independent experiments.
chemical production has now been replaced by biotechnological processes using the natural overproducer A. gossypii [28].
Riboflavin biosynthesis relies on the purine pathway,
because GTP is the immediate precursor. Accordingly, it
seems reasonably that redirecting metabolic flux toward
purine biosynthesis might improve riboflavin production.
In fact, previous studies described that supplementation
with riboflavin precursors can enhance the production of
the vitamin in A. gossypii cultures [3,31]. PRPP is an essential metabolite in the de novo and salvage purine pathways
and it has been reported that a considerable fraction of the
intracellular pool of PRPP is consumed by the purine
pathways [7]. We therefore explored the effect of increasing the activity of PRPP synthetase on riboflavin production in A. gossypii.
AGL080C gene is a syntenic ortholog of PRS3 from S. cerevisiae and their gene products share 88% of the amino
acids. On the other hand, AGR371C shows a high degree
of similarity with both PRS2 and PRS4 from S. cerevisiae
and displays 80% of identity at protein level. Furthermore, AGR371C is flanked by the UBP9 and UBC6 genes,
thus exhibiting a high level of synteny with regard to the
genomic locations of PRS2 and PRS4 in S. cerevisiae. This
redundancy between PRS genes and their chromosomal
synteny supports the idea that a genome duplication
event of ancestral yeast genome would have occurred to
originate the S. cerevisiae genome [32].

The homology between PRS genes from A. gossypii and S.
cerevisiae together with our results concerning the
AgPRS2,4 and AgPRS3 disruptions indicate that two PRPP
synthetase interaction complexes may also exist in A. gossypii. We found three possible phenotypes when AgPRS2,4
and AgPRS3 disruptions were combined: synthetic
lethality for the double mutant, a growth alteration and
an impairment in PRPP synthetase activity for the Δprs3
strain, and a slight reduction in total Prs activity that did
not elicit phenotypic alterations in the Δprs2,4 mutant.
Thus, similarly to what occurs in yeast it could be speculated that in A. gossypii Prs2,4 and Prs3 function as two different PRPP synthetase units that interact with Prs5 and
Prs1, respectively, to yield physiologically specialized
enzymatic complexes. The different phenotypes obtained
with AgPRS2,4 and AgPRS3 disruptions can be explained
in terms of a different contribution of each isoform to the
specific PRPP synthetase functional unit.
Another important issue concerning AgPRS3 disruption is
that the Δprs3 strain displayed an abnormal highly
branched growth pattern. Previous work has described
that Prs gene products are able to interact with a number
of proteins and to affect different biological processes
and, in particular, cell integrity signaling through Rlm1.
As a consequence, perturbations in the expression of PRS
genes may result in many unexpected cellular events, such
as an abnormal increased chitin content and other cell
wall alterations [33-35]. It has also been described that the
mechanisms controlling cell polarity, and therefore
hyphal morphogenesis, are fairly homologous between S.
cerevisiae and A. gossypii [36]. It therefore seems reasonable to posit that alterations in cell polarity and cell wall
morphogenesis might affect the branching pattern of the
A. gossypii hyphae.
As mentioned above, the altered branching pattern of the

Δprs3 strain could account for the condensed phenotype

of the colonies that finally resulted in a slightly higher
biomass. In contrast, the opposite effect has been reported
when either AgPRS2,4 or agprs2,4-IQ alleles are overexpressed in Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana tabacum [37],
demonstrating that variations in the PRPP synthetase
activity may have pleiotropic effects. Perhaps the occurrence and interaction of fairly heterologous isoforms of
PRPP synthetases from A. gossypii together with endogenous isoforms of plant origin or other proteins in the
plant cell could provide an explanation for the effect on
biomass accumulation.
Our results demonstrate that the PRPP synthetases from
A. gossypii are inhibited by ADP. The abolishment of ADP
inhibition in A. gossypii and overexpression of PRS genes
result in: i) an increase in PRPP synthetase activity and ii)
improved riboflavin production, which was the main

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6750/8/67

objective of the present work. However, unlike the overexpression of PRS3 alleles, the increase in the levels of either
PRS2,4 or prs2,4-IQ mRNA was not correlated with a
marked rise in PRPP synthetase activity, confirming that
PRS2,4 and PRS3 contribute unequally to total Prs activity. However, an improvement of 80% in the production
of riboflavin was obtained in the PRS-engineered strains,
which is clearly of significance as regards biotechnological
endeavors. Nonetheless, we failed to find a significant
enhancement in the production of the vitamin when the
prs-IQ alleles were expressed. This may be explained in
terms of the existence of a strict transcriptional and metabolic regulation of the purine pathway downstream from
the synthesis of PRPP, reported previously in A. gossypii
and S. cerevisiae [3,4,38-42]. In addition, it is also to be
expected that the intracellular concentration of ADP in the
PRS-overexpressing strains would be insufficient to cause
inhibition and this would therefore account for the analogous behaviour of the overexpressing mutant strains as
compared with the wild-type overexpressing strains.

Conclusion
In this study we have demonstrated that partially increasing enzymatic PRPP synthetase activity results directly in
enhanced riboflavin overproduction in A. gossypii. We
have engineered A. gossypii strains that show a significant
improvement in vitamin production. In terms of industrial production, a 80% increase in the fermentation process represents an extremely relevant advance. Further
manipulations might be performed to entirely deregulate
the purine pathway and to increase GTP availability and
hence riboflavin production.
We also show that different mutimeric interacting PRPP
synthetase complexes may exist in A. gossypii, as described
for the S. cerevisiae enzymes. Additionally, we prove that
modifying PRPP synthetase activity in A. gossypii affects its
growth pattern, suggesting that homeostasis of the PRPP
intracellular pool must be important for the cell integrity
and mycelial growth of A. gossypii.
