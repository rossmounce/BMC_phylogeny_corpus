Abstract
Background: Glutamate is the principal excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system which acts by the
activation of either ionotropic (AMPA, NMDA and kainate receptors) or G-protein coupled metabotropic receptors.
Glutamate is widely accepted to play a major role in the path physiology of migraine as implicated by data from animal
and human studies. Genes involved in synthesis, metabolism and regulation of both glutamate and its receptors could
be, therefore, considered as potential candidates for causing/predisposing to migraine when mutated.
Methods: The association of polymorphic variants of GRIA1-GRIA4 genes which encode for the four subunits (GluR1GluR4) of the alpha-amino-3- hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid (AMPA) receptor for glutamate was tested
in migraineurs with and without aura (MA and MO) and healthy controls.
Results: Two variants in the regulative regions of GRIA1 (rs2195450) and GRIA3 (rs3761555) genes resulted strongly
associated with MA (P = 0.00002 and P = 0.0001, respectively), but not associated with MO, suggesting their role in
cortical spreading depression. Whereas the rs548294 variant in GRIA1 gene showed association primarily with MO
phenotype, supporting the hypothesis that MA and MO phenotypes could be genetically related. These variants
modify binding sites for transcription factors altering the expression of GRIA1 and GRIA3 genes in different conditions.
Conclusions: This study represents the first genetic evidence of a link between glutamate receptors and migraine.
Background
Migraine is a multifactorial disorder in which genetic factors play a relevant role in both predisposing and determining underlying mechanisms. Approaches to identified
genes for monogenic subtypes migraine (e.g. Familial
Hemiplegic Migraine - FHM) has been successful
(CACNA1A, ATP1A2, SCN1A genes causing FMH 1, 2
and 3 respectively) [1-4]. Conversely, finding genes for
the most frequent types of migraine (with and without
aura) and defining their pathogenic role has proven much
more difficult [5]. However, synaptic hyper-excitability
has been invocated as one major pathogenic mechanism
in both common and monogenic forms of migraine, and
data from animal (experimental cortical spreading

dura-mater circulation, electrophysiological studies) [6,7]
and human (assessment of glutamate concentration in
plasma, platelets and cerebrospinal fluid in migraneurs
vs. control, glutamate and migraine symptoms; glutamate
and sensitization) [8] studies suggest that glutamate is
one of the principal factors involved.
Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in
the central nervous system which exerts this action
mainly through its interaction with its ionotropic or
metabotropic receptors.
In this study we investigated the association of GRIA1,
GRIA2, GRIA3 and GRIA4 genes that encode for the four
subunits (GluR1-GluR4) of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid (AMPA) ionotropic
receptor and their variants to migraine with and without
aura (MA and MO).

This is the first study that shows a significant association between genetic variants of glutamate receptor and
MA.

Methods
Population Collection & Phenotype

Two hundred fifty outpatients consecutively observed
from January 2006 to December 2008 at the Service of
Diagnosis and Therapy of Headache of the Second University, Naples and two hundred sixty healthy volunteers
consecutively enrolled during the same time interval
were included in the study. Cases and controls were
matched for sex, came from the same small geographical
area and were Caucasian. All gave informed consent to
the research procedures including molecular genetic
analyses. The study protocol included history, direct clinical and neurological examination, MRI with both arterial
and venous angiography sequences; venous blood collection for routine blood analysis as well as DNA extraction
from lymphocytes according to standard salting out procedure [9]. Migraineurs were diagnosed as having either
migraine with (MA) or migraine without (MO) aura,
according to the 2004 International Headache Society
[10] diagnostic criteria. The study population was comprised of 244 migraineurs (M/F 56/188; age 14-64 years;
MA/MO 135/109); 7 patients who resulted affected with
Familial Hemiplegic Migraine were excluded from the
study.
For the statistical analysis three experimental groups
were considered: all migraineurs together (MA+MO= M)
and MA and MO separately. Healthy control individuals
(204 females and 56 males aged 21-64 years) of Caucasian
origin matching for age and sex the migraineurs served as
control for all three experimental groups.
Polymorphisms selection and Genotyping

SNP selection was performed inspecting the HapMap
database PhaseIII/Rel 2, Feb09 on NCBI B36 assembly,
dbSNP b126 http://www.hapmap.org/index.html.en.
Default parameters in Haploview were used to create
haplotype blocks (95% confidence intervals) as described
by Gabriel et al (2002) [11].
TagSNPs were selected at an r2 threshold of 0.80 from
all SNPs with minor allele frequency (MAF) > 0.15 allowing us to capture more than 80% of the haplotypic diversity of these genes.
GRIA1

The gene maps on chromosome 5q33.2 and spans a
genomic region of about 320 kb. After consulting the
HapMap database http://www.hapmap.org/index.html.
en, we identified along the 320 kb of the GRIA1 gene four
main blocks of linkage disequilibrium (LD) with few
major haplotypes. The first block included the first two
GRIA1 exons and the 5' upstream region. The second

Page 2 of 12

block was in intron 2, the third block included the exons
3-5, and the remaining part of the GRIA1 gene and the
end was in the fourth block of LD. In consideration of the
extension of LD inside each block we selected two SNPs
in the first block, two SNPs in the fourth block and one
SNP in the second and third blocks. In particular, the
SNPs chosen were: rs548294, rs2195450, rs1463747,
rs2963954, rs4530817 and rs1461225 (figure 1). All SNPs
were genotyped by restriction digestion using the
enzymes MwoI, TaqI, BsgI, RsaI, MnlI, and HpaI respectively.
GRIA2

For the GRIA2 gene, that expands a genomic region of
143 kb on chromosome 4q32.1, two main blocks of LD
were identified. We selected four SNPs (two for each
block): rs13138842, rs11946396, rs28495775 and
rs11728471 that were genotyped by restriction digestion
using the enzymes MluI, AccII, HuncII, and HphI respectively (figure 1).
GRIA3

The GRIA3 gene spans a genomic region of about 300 kb
consisting of 17 exons, and is located in Xq24-q28 region,
a critical region for migraine [12]. In a previous unpublished study we completely sequenced the coding and
regulative regions of the GRIA3 gene in ten Italian
migraine patients. We detected only a synonymous
sequence variation in coding region C/T N400N
(rs502434), and a number of SNPs located in intronic and
promoter region. Taking in account SNPs distribution
and LD-plot for GRIA3 gene, in a first step we selected 8
SNPs located in different LD-blocks: -1952T/C SNP
(rs3761555) in the promoter region, the G/A SNP
rs12559450 in intron 2, the G/A SNP rs4825840 in intron
2, the C/A SNP rs4825849 in intron 3, the T/C SNP
rs5911598 in intron 5, the C/T SNP N400N (rs502434) in
exon 9, the C/T SNP rs2354037 in intron 12 and the T/C
SNP rs5910006 in intron 14 (figure 1). In a preliminary
analysis, using a smaller size cohort of migraine patients
and controls (100 cases vs 100 controls) only one SNPs
rs3761555 showed a trend of allelic differences between
cases and controls, than was analysed in more detail.
Genotyping was performed by restriction digestion using
the enzyme BglII.
GRIA4

Also for the GRIA4 gene, which spans over 370 kb on
chromosome 11q22.3, only two main blocks of LD were
identified. We selected four SNPs (two for each block):
rs11226805, rs590928, rs649098 and rs589104 that were
genotyped by restriction digestion using the enzymes
DdeI, Eco57I, MboI, and NlaIII respectively (figure 1).
All PCRs were performed as described in our previous
work [13].
Briefly, PCR reactions (10 μl final volume) containing 2
mmol/L MgCl2, 0.5 mol/L of each primer, 200 mol/L

Figure 1 For each gene is reported the genomic structure, the LD plot with the genotyped SNPs. For GRIA3 gene the exons indicated in dark
colour are alternative spliced in two different transcripts.

dNTPs, 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Fermentas) and
approximately 20 ng of genomic DNA were undertaken
for genotyping purposes.
Thermal cycling was performed with an initial denaturation of 180 seconds at 94°C, followed by 35 cycles of 30
sec at 94°C, 30 sec at melting temperature (MT), 30 sec at
72°C, and a terminal extension of 10 min at 72°C. PCR
products were then digested with restriction enzymes
and analyzed by electrophoresis on 3% agarose gels.
Ethidium bromide stained gels were digitally imaged and
manually scored for genotypes. Table 1 shows the oligo

sets and genotyping procedures for the GRIA1 and
GRIA3 associated SNPs.
Association Analysis

To detect association between the tested markers and
migraine, we performed chi-square (χ2) analysis to test
for significant differences in allele and genotype frequencies in case versus control results. χ2 provides the likelihood of a deviation in the distribution of the same
attributes in different classes (e.g. allelic frequencies in
controls versus affected subjects). If the probability (p-

value) of an equal distribution between the two groups is
below a determined significance level α (in percent), the
statistical output will show enough significance to assume
LD and therefore association. The p value of this test is
asymptotically equal to the p value obtained in Armitage's trend test (ATT). ATT takes into account genotypes
rather than alleles, avoiding a possible bias caused by
doubling the sample size. It assumes an additive (or codominant) disease model where all disease alleles have
equal and independent contribution to disease risk. The
ATT is valid and powerful under a broad range of disease
mechanisms. Second, allele and genotype frequencies,
dominant and recessive genetic models as well as odds
ratios were calculated to characterise the distribution of a
distinct genotypes in different phenotypic subgroups of
the population (using FINETTI, http://ihg.gsf.de/cgi-bin/
hw/hwa1.pl). Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) was
also calculated using FINETTI. The analysis of the statistical power was performed using the Genetic Power Calculator software http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/
gpc/cc2.html[14] assuming a significance level (α) of 0.05,
a lifetime risk of 2, and the MAF of each SNP as calculated in our control group. In the population-based association analysis, the nominal significance threshold was
set at P < 0.05 and lowered to P < 0.0017 after the multiple comparison correction of Bonferroni considering 22
SNPs, the three clinical groups analyzed, genotypesalleles and females-males. Confidence intervals at 95%
are provided for all odds-ratio (OR) values. Haplotype
frequencies were calculated using the Estimation Haplotype (EH) program (Jurg Ott, Rockefeller University). A P
level of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays

To determine whether the c.-1952T>C SNP in GRIA3
promoter region alters nuclear protein-DNA interactions, EMSAs was performed using radio-labelled oligonucleotide probes containing either -1952T or -1952C.
Nuclear extracts were prepared from HEK 293 and

SH5Y5Y cell lines as described by Granelli-Piperno et al.
[15]. Binding reactions mixture contained 10 ng 32Plabeled oligonucleotide probe (105 cpm), 15 μg nuclear
extract, 2 μg poly (dI-dC), 100 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2,
20 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol and protease inhibitor, in a total vol
of 20 μl. To perform super shift experiments, 2 μg of the
anti-HSF1 antibody (Celbio) was added to the binding
reaction mixture. In competition experiments, 100-fold
molar excess of cold oligonucleotides was added to the
binding reaction mixture. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at room temperature, resolved on nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel, dried, and exposed to
autoradiography. The same assay was performed for the
c.-2012C>T SNP rs548294 in GRIA1 promoter region
and for c.+561G>A SNP rs2195450 in intron 1.

Luciferase assays

To test the functional activity of the T>C polymorphism
in the promoter region of the GRIA3 gene, we first identified the putative start site at -823 to the ATG, using the
Promoter scan software vs2. A fragment of 1854 bp of the
GRIA3 promoter encompassing base pairs -1411 to +325
(referred to the predicted start site) and including the
T>C polymorphism was amplified from genomic DNA of
migraine patients with genotype CC and controls with
genotype TT. The primers used for generating this fragment were sense: 5'-GCGCGCCTCGAGTTTGAAGATGAGAGAACTGG-3' and antisense: 5'-GCGCGCAA
GCTTCAAAAGAAAGAGAACGAAAG-3' which contain 5'-XhoI and 3'-HindIII restriction sites (highlighted
bold sequences), respectively.
PCR products were double digested using XhoI and
HindIII and then legated into a linearized pGL3-Basic
vector (Promega, Madison USA) containing a Firefly
Luciferase reporter gene. The inserts of the constructs
were verified by sequencing before transient transfection.
Transfections were carried out using HEK293T cells.
Cells were co-transfected with 1 μg of reporter plasmid
and 10 ng of pRL-TK control vector (Promega, Madison
USA) containing Renilla luciferase, which was used to
correct for transfection efficiency. Transfection cells were
harvested after 24 h and cell lysates were assayed sequentially for Firefly and Renilla luciferase activity using a
dual-reporter assay system (Promega, Madison USA).
Transfections were performed in quadruplicate for each
plasmid construct. Changes in gene transcription were
calculated relative to the corrected luciferase activity of
the empty pGL3-Basic vector (control).
Ethical approval

This research was reviewed and approved by the University of Naples Human Research Ethics Committee and all
subjects participating in the study gave informed consent.

Results
GRIA1 and GRIA3 genes are associated with migraine

We selected SNPs for each gene (GRIA1-GRIA4) considering their distribution in LD blocks (figure 1). All variants were genotyped in a well-characterized panel of 244
cases and 260 controls (see methods). In controls, all
SNPs analyzed are in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
(HWE) (with the exception of rs2195450) and showed
allele frequencies comparable to those observed in the
Caucasian population and reported in the HapMap or
SNP browser databases.
No significant association with the disease for any of
the four SNPs in GRIA2 and GRIA4 genes tested was
observed.
Significant association was observed for two SNPs
located in the first block of LD of GRIA1 gene including

Page 5 of 12

the regulative region and the first two exons. Allelic and
genotype frequencies distribution of the promoter 2012C/T (rs548294) marker in cases and controls showed
significant association with migraine (p = 0.00009 and p =
0.0005, respectively). Stratified analyses of migraine subtypes were also undertaken indicating association primarily attributed to MO subtype group (P = 0.0003) and
particularly in females (P = 0.0007) (Table 2). These differences remained statistically significant when Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was applied
(Migraine all: alleles p = 0.002; genotypes p = 0.01; MO
alleles: p = 0.008; genotypes p = 0.03; Females all: alleles p
= 0.02; genotypes p = 0.05) (Table 2).
The analysis of the +561 G>A SNP (rs2195450) also
showed significant association in both allelic and genotype distributions (p = 0.0002 and p = 0.0007, respectively) (p = 0.005 and p = 0.02 after Bonferroni
corrections). Stratified analyses of migraine subtypes
showed a specific association with MA subtype group for
both allelic and genotypic frequencies (p = 0.00002 and p
= 0.00008) (p = 0.0005 and p = 0.002 after Bonferroni corrections) (Table 2). However, the SNP rs2195450, was the
only SNP found in Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium
(DHW) both in controls and in patients (p < 0.05).
Regarding GRIA3 gene, we obtained statistically significant evidence for an association to migraine phenotype
for the -1952T/C variant (rs3761555) located in the regulative region of the gene (allele C frequencies: controlsmigraineurs = 22% vs. 34%) (Table 2). In consideration of
the X chromosomal localization of GRIA3 gene, we analyzed the data by gender, showing significant associations
in females for both allelic and genotype distributions (p =
0.0006 and p = 0.0009, respectively). Stratified analyses of
migraine subtypes showed a specific association with the
female MA subtype group for either allelic or genotypic
frequencies (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.0002, respectively)
(Table 2). These differences remained statistically significant after Bonferroni correction (alleles p = 0.003; genotypes p = 0.005) (Table 2). The male group was not
analyzed independently due to its limited size (n = 56).
The statistical power for the three associated SNPs in
GRIA1 and GRIA3 genes was 97% for rs548294, 97% for
rs2195450 and 93% for rs3761555. When we calculated
the statistical power for subgroups (MA, MO, females,
males) it remained high in MA and females, but it
decreased for MO and males subgroup due to their limited size. We analyzed the distribution of the haplotypes
formed by the associated SNPs in GRIA1 gene in cases
and controls. Haplotype frequencies (calculated using the
EH program) were significantly different in cases and
controls (chi-square = 12.72, df = 3, p-value 0.005). Haplotype-specific testing showed that the putative risk haplotype T_A (rs548294- rs2195450) was more frequent in
cases than in controls, resulting in p-value of 0.002 and an

p-values for allele and genotype distributions are showed. Minor allele frequency is indicated as MAF. To assess the dosage effect of possessing zero, one or two copies of the risk allele (i.e. an additive
effect), the Armitage test for linear trend in proportions was performed on the genotype frequency data. Genetic risk magnitudes (effect size) were estimated by calculating odds ratio (ORs) with
95% confidence intervals (95% CI). All statistical tests were two-tailed. Statistical significance was defined as a p value lower than 0.05. NS, not significant after Bonferroni correction, * Pvalues after

OR of 2.1. Conversely, the putative protective haplotype
C_G (rs548294- rs2195450) was more frequent in controls than in cases resulting in a p-value of 0.00001 and an
OR of 0.4 (Table 3).
Possible additive interactions of the two most associated SNPs in GRIA1 (rs548294) and GRIA3 (rs3761555)
genes were evaluated in those subjects who had both
SNPs characterization. GRIA1 SNP rs2195450 was not
analyzed because it was in HWD. In Migraine patients,
the p-value for the sole risk allele of the GRIA1 gene (TT/
TT, CT/TT genotypes) was 0.03, OR 1.68 (CI = 1.022.77); the p-value for the sole risk allele of the GRIA3
gene (CC/TC, CC/CC genotypes) was 0.005, 2.28 (CI =
1.27-4.11) and the p-value for the combined two risk
alleles (TT/TC, TT/CC, CT/TC, CT/CC genotypes) was
0.00001, OR 3.35 (CI = 1.96-5.74) (Table 4).
-1952 T>C variant in GRIA3 regulative region have
functional significance

Bioinformatics predictions by TRANSFAC [16] showed
that the -1952T>C associated variant could affect the
putative transcription factor binding sites HSF (Heat
Shock Factor) and CdxA. To determine whether the c.1952T>C SNP alters nuclear protein-DNA interactions,
EMSAs were performed using radio-labelled oligonucleotide probes containing either -1952T or -1952C (see
materials and methods). Two distinct complexes were
revealed on incubation of the probes with nuclear extract
from unstimulated HEK293T cells (figure 2A) and the 1952T probe showed stronger DNA protein-binding
activity compared with the -1952C probe. EMSA assay
was also performed using nuclear extract from neuroblastoma cell line SH5Y5Y and obtained the same results
(data not shown). To further assess the binding specificity
and the differences in binding affinity between the T and
C allele, competition assay was performed with unlabeled
-1952T or -1952C oligonucleotide. The results revealed
that unlabeled -1952T oligonucleotide but not -1952C
with 100- fold molar excess fully blocked the binding of
the radiolabeled -1952T probe or -1952C probe with
nuclear protein(s). Moreover, to determine if HSF1 is one
of the transcription factors bound to the complexes, antiHSF1 antibody was used in super shift assays. In these
experimental conditions none of the complexes was specific for HSF1 (figure 2A). These data suggest that the 1952T>C polymorphism can affect the binding affinity of
the GRIA3 promoter with several transcription factor(s)
and the variant T allele has a stronger binding strength
compared with the C allele. To test the functional effect
of the -1952 T>C variant we performed the luciferase
assay using the promoter region of GRIA3 gene.
When HEK293T cells were transfected with the -1411
to +325 region, the luciferase activity generated by the C
construct was similar to that generated by the T con-

struct but interestingly, under heat shock condition (at
40°C for 1 h) the luciferase activity generated by the C
construct was 1.3-fold greater than that generated by the
T construct (figure 3).
Functional analysis of the associated GRIA1 variants

Bioinformatics predictions did not show any clear alteration of transcription factor binding sites both for SNP 2012C>T and +561G>A. To determine whether these
variations could alter nuclear protein-DNA interactions
we performed EMSAs assays using radiolabelled oligonucleotide probes containing either -2012C or -2012T and
+561G or +561A (see materials and methods) (figure 2B).
No binding affinity was revealed for both +561G and
+561A alleles. In contrast, two distinct complexes were
revealed on incubation of the probes -2012T and -2012C
with nuclear extract from unstimulated HEK293T cells
and in particular, the -2012T probe showed stronger
DNA protein-binding activity compared with the -2012C
probe (figure 2B). The binding specificity and the differences in binding affinity between the T and C allele was
also demonstrated in competition assay using unlabeled 2012T or -2012C oligonucleotide. The results revealed
that unlabeled -2012T oligonucleotide but not -2012C
with 100- fold molar excess fully blocked the binding of
the radiolabeled -2012T probe or -2012C probe with
nuclear protein(s) (figure 2B).
GRIAs comparative analysis

The identification of associated variants in the promoter
regions of both GRIA1 and GRIA3 genes and their evidence for functional roles, suggested us to investigate
about the evolutive conservation of this class of genes.
We selected from databases the full-length sequences of
the transcripts of GRIA1-GRIA4 genes and the regulative
regions at the 5' of each gene. To postulate a coordinate
regulation of these genes, all sequences were compared
using the vista software and the results suggest that
GRIA1 seems be the ancestral gene and is more similar to
GRIA3 gene as for other genes (GRIA2 and GRIA4) (figure 4).

Discussion
Glutamate is a major excitatory neurotransmitter in the
central nervous system, thought to be widely involved in
migraine mechanisms. Indeed, migraine brain nociceptive centres, including the trigeminal ganglion, trigeminal
nucleus caudalis, and thalamus, contain glutamate-positive neurons, and glutamate activates the trigeminal
nucleus caudalis. Glutamate is implicated in cortical
spreading depression (CSD), trigemino-vascular activation, and central sensitization [17]. These observations
argue for a strong link between migraine and the glutamatergic system. A link that is important to further char-

acterization and understanding of migraine mechanisms
in order to deliver effective therapies.
In this study we have investigated the role of glutamate
receptors, ionotropic, AMPA (GRIA1, GRIA2 GRIA3 and
GRIA4 genes) and their variants in MA and MO. We
found two variants in GRIA1 gene (rs548294 and
rs2195450) and one variant in GRIA3 gene (rs3761555),
all located in the regulative region of the genes, to be
associated with the migraine phenotype in an Italian population. Interestingly, both the GRIA1 and GRIA3 variants were specifically associated with MA suggesting a
role of these genes in CSD, which is retained to be the
path physiological mechanism-underlying aura. However, to date we cannot exclude that these variant can also
be associated to MO phenotype due to limited size of
MO subgroup. In fact, the rs548294 SNP in GRIA1 gene
was primarily associated with MO rather than MA.
Although MO and MA are separate categories according
to the ICHD-II criteria these two subtypes of migraine
share some path physiological mechanisms [18]. Several
studies support that the same SNP or different SNPs in
the same gene could be associated with both MO and
MA phenotypes [5].
We analyzed the distribution of the haplotypes formed
by the associated SNPs in GRIA1 gene in cases and controls. Haplotype-specific testing showed that the putative
risk haplotype T_A was more frequent in cases than in
controls (13% and 7%, respectively, P = 0.001) and was
associated with increased risk of migraine (OR = 2,10;
95% CI (1.30- 3,12)) compared with the risk of the two

alleles taken separately. Furthermore, our analysis of the
combined effects of the two SNPs in GRIA1 (rs548294)
and GRIA3 (rs3761555) genes not supported a synergy of
the two SNPs in the genetic susceptibility to migraine.
Indeed, in migraine patients, the combined two risk allele
genotypes exhibited an OR that was more or less the sum
of the ORs of each risk allele taken separately, suggesting
that, when both risk alleles are present, the risk to
develop migraine is merely the sum of the effect carried
by each single risk allele.
Although our data need to be confirmed in more
numerous series as well as in populations of different origin, the identification of a statistically significant genetic
link between glutamate receptor genes and MA needs to
be highlighted. A growing number of scientific report
based on preclinical and clinical data argue strongly for a
role of glutamatergic receptor activation in migraine and
in particular in CSD [19]. Despite the remarkable advancing in the pharmacotherapy, there is still a tremendous
need for the research of more effective treatments. Glutamate receptors antagonists have been recently proposed
as major target addressed for the treatment of migraine.
Glutamate receptors indeed represent a promising target
for a valuable, non-vasoactive oriented approach to the
treatment of migraine [20].
The SNP rs2195450, which shows the strongest association, is in Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium (DHW) both
in controls and in patients. DHW may be due to several
factors including genotyping errors, inappropriate population stratification and selection, inbreeding, presence of

a causative allele or simply the chance. We can exclude
with high confidence that DHW as well as patient-control
differences could be due to genotyping errors. For all
SNPs, about 20 subjects were randomly selected and
sequenced; for rs2195450 the sample was increased to
100 subjects. The original classification was confirmed in
all samples. Moreover, for the autosome genes, the presence of DHW in different direction in controls and in
patients, as observed for rs2195450, is compatible with
the segregation of a causative variant according to a dominant model [21]. However, we cannot exclude that DHW
is due to other confounding factors, and then the association of this SNP must be considered with prudence.
Further remarkable in our cohort is that GRIA1 and
GRIA3 variants are associated to migraine in female but
not in male subjects. To date we cannot assert that AMPA
receptor genes and genetic variations within them may
act differently in the two sexes, in light of the small sample size of case males that do not provide enough statistical power to detect association.
However, the underlying mechanism by which these
variants confer susceptibility to migraine remains
unclear. Bioinformatics predictions showed that the C

Conclusions
These results indicate an involvement of GRIA1 and
GRIA3 genes in the susceptibility to migraine with aura
and encourage replication in other data sets. Moreover,
functional investigations to explain the role of glutamate
receptors variants in MA might be useful.

variant of GRIA3 gene could affect putative binding sites
for transcription factors altering the consensus sequence.
We strengthened this hypothesis by transfecting the
HEK293T cells with a promoter region of GRIA3 gene. It
should be highlighted that, under stress condition the
luciferase activity generated by the C construct (associated allele) was 1.3-fold greater than that generated by the
T construct. Moreover, EMSA assays suggest that the 1952T>C polymorphism can affect the binding affinity of
the GRIA3 promoter with transcription factor(s) and the
variant T allele has a stronger binding strength compared
with the C allele. Considering that the T-allele displays
lower promoter transcription activity, we infer that the
nuclear factor(s) bound to the region covering the 1952T>C polymorphism may function as negative regulator(s) for GRIA3 transcription. Therefore, the 1952T>C polymorphism may affect the GRIA3 promoter
binding affinity with nuclear proteins and in turn the
GRIA3 expression, which consequently modulates the
individual's susceptibility to migraine. Future genetic and
functional studies are necessary to further elucidate the
role of GRIA3 in migraine susceptibility. Preliminary
results using an Australian case-control panel indicate
that the same -1952T>C polymorphism showed a trend
of association with migraine (p = 0.04) (L. Griffiths personal communication).
More complex is the case of GRIA1 gene where only the
-2012C>T variant seems to affect the binding affinity of
the GRIA1 promoter with transcription factor(s) and the
variant T allele has a stronger binding strength compared
with the C allele. Considering that the T-allele is also the
risk allele we can infer that nuclear factor/s bound to the
region covering the -2012C>T polymorphism may function as positive regulator(s) for GRIA1 transcription.
