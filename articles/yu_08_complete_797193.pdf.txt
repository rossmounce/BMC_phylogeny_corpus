Abstract
Background: Mitochondrial DNA sequences are extensively used as genetic markers not only for
studies of population or ecological genetics, but also for phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses.
Complete mt-sequences can reveal information about gene order and its variation, as well as gene
and genome evolution when sequences from multiple phyla are compared. Mitochondrial gene
order is highly variable among mollusks, with bivalves exhibiting the most variability. Of the 41
complete mt genomes sequenced so far, 12 are from bivalves. We determined, in the current study,
the complete mitochondrial DNA sequence of Crassostrea hongkongensis. We present here an
analysis of features of its gene content and genome organization in comparison with two other
Crassostrea species to assess the variation within bivalves and among main groups of mollusks.
Results: The complete mitochondrial genome of C. hongkongensis was determined using long PCR
and a primer walking sequencing strategy with genus-specific primers. The genome is 16,475 bp in
length and contains 12 protein-coding genes (the atp8 gene is missing, as in most bivalves), 22
transfer tRNA genes (including a suppressor tRNA gene), and 2 ribosomal RNA genes, all of which
appear to be transcribed from the same strand. A striking finding of this study is that a DNA
segment containing four tRNA genes (trnk1, trnC, trnQ1 and trnN) and two duplicated or split rRNA
gene (rrnL5' and rrnS) are absent from the genome, when compared with that of two other extant
Crassostrea species, which is very likely a consequence of loss of a single genomic region present in
ancestor of C. hongkongensis. It indicates this region seem to be a "hot spot" of genomic
rearrangements over the Crassostrea mt-genomes. The arrangement of protein-coding genes in C.
hongkongensis is identical to that of Crassostrea gigas and Crassostrea virginica, but higher amino acid
sequence identities are shared between C. hongkongensis and C. gigas than between other pairs.
There exists significant codon bias, favoring codons ending in A or T and against those ending with
C. Pair analysis of genome rearrangements showed that the rearrangement distance is great
between C. gigas-C. hongkongensis and C. virginica, indicating a high degree of rearrangements within
Crassostrea. The determination of complete mt-genome of C. hongkongensis has yielded useful
insight into features of gene order, variation, and evolution of Crassostrea and bivalve mt-genomes.

Conclusion: The mt-genome of C. hongkongensis shares some similarity with, and interesting
differences to, other Crassostrea species and bivalves. The absence of trnC and trnN genes and
duplicated or split rRNA genes from the C. hongkongensis genome is a completely novel feature not
previously reported in Crassostrea species. The phenomenon is likely due to the loss of a segment
that is present in other Crassostrea species and was present in ancestor of C. hongkongensis, thus a
case of "tandem duplication-random loss (TDRL)". The mt-genome and new feature presented
here reveal and underline the high level variation of gene order and gene content in Crassostrea and
bivalves, inspiring more research to gain understanding to mechanisms underlying gene and genome
evolution in bivalves and mollusks.

Background
As an organellar genome, animal mitochondrial DNA is
typically a circular molecule of 15–20 kb, usually encoding 13 proteins, 22 transfer RNAs, and 2 ribosomal RNAs
[1]. Thanks to its maternal inheritance, rapid evolutionary
rate, and lack of recombination, fragments of mitochondrial DNA have been extensively used for studies of
genetic structure, phylogenetics, and phylogeography at
various taxonomic levels. Since studying complete mt
sequences can uncover more information about gene
order, rearrangements, and other variation at the genome
level for all phyla, there have been significant increases in
the number of complete mitochondrial sequences available in recent years [2-7]. It is known that mitochondrial
gene order and its variation can be very useful for inferring
evolutionary relationships [8]. Reportedly, molluscan
species show an extraordinary amount of variation in
gene arrangement, in contrast to the more limited gene
rearrangement in many species of Arthropoda [3,4,6].
Of the 41 complete mollusk mt genomes available in
GenBank, 12 of which are from bivalves, including Mytilus
edulis, Mytilus trossulus, Mytilus galloprovincialis, Venerupis
philippinarum, Lampsilis ornata etc., as well as two from
oyster species. Oysters are distributed worldwide and are
a species-rich bivalve group. Mitochondrial genomes of
two oyster species, C. gigas and C. virginica, are available
recently [5]. In comparing the mt-DNA of these two species, there is evidence of extensive genomic rearrangements and several duplications; mitochondrial genome
information from additional species, therefore, would
shed light on our relatively limited understanding of oyster evolutionary relationships.
C. hongkongensis (known as C. rivularis, previously) is primarily found in waters along the coast of the South China
Sea [9]. With an annual landing of around 1.0 million
metric tons, oyster farming of C. hongkongensis has been
supporting one of the largest marine aquaculture industries in this area, marketing its products primarily to Hong
Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and local markets as well. Populations were studied using different genetic markers, however, more polymorphic markers are needed for better and

more detailed stock analysis [10-12]. With the process of
urbanization and industrialization in some coastal
regions, wild populations of this species have experienced
some degree of decline. Meanwhile, the development of
the oyster farming industry is driving resource management concerns and a desire for stock improvement. Stock
enhancement is desired for stable and sustainable development of this industry. Interest in C. hongkongensis mitochondrial DNA has been increasing recently, partially due
to the potential of mtDNA as a genetic marker for population analysis, stock management, and breeding programs.
In this study, we determined the complete mitochondrial
genome sequence of C. hongkongensis, in the hope of providing mt genome data for exploring possible mechanisms of gene rearrangements, addressing phylogenetic
relationships among oysters and other molluscan species,
as well as identifying more variable mtDNA regions for
genetics studies and stock management of this important
aquaculture resource.

Results and discussion
Genomic organization and structure
The mitochondrial genome of C. hongkongensis is 16,475
bp in length (GenBank accession number EU266073),
shorter than that of the other two oysters whose mtgenomes have been sequenced, C. gigas (18,224 bp) and
C. virginica (17,243 bp). However, the size of the C. hongkongesis mt-genome is certainly within the range of size of
molluscan mtDNA genomes sequenced to date, i.e. from
13,670 bp in Biomphalaria glabrata to 32,115 bp in Placopecten magellanicus. The C. hongkongensis mtDNA contains
12 protein-coding genes (without atp8), 22 transfer tRNA
genes (including a suppressor tRNA gene) and 2 ribosomal RNA genes (Fig. 1, 2 and Table 1), all apparently
transcribed from the same strand, a common feature in
marine bivalves.

The arrangement of protein-coding genes in C. hongkongensis is identical to that of C. gigas and C. virginica, in the
order of cox1, cox3, cob, cox2, atp6, nad2, nad4, nad5, nad6,
nad3, nad1 and nad4L (Fig. 2), with tRNA genes punctuating the order [5]. However, the location of some tRNA
genes, ribosomal RNA genes and a major noncoding

region (MNR) differ to a great extent among the three
Crassostrea genomes (Fig. 2). The overall genomic organization of C. hongkongensis is more similar to that of C.
gigas than to C. virginica, corresponding evidently to their
closer genetic relationship. In contrast, in Mytilus congeners M. edulis, M. trossulus and M. galloprovincialis, not
only are protein-coding genes arranged in the following
identical order: cox1, atp6, nad4L, nad5, nad6, cob, cox2,
nad1, nad4, cox3, nad2 and nad3; but also the order of
tRNAs, ribosomal RNA, and control region are almost the
same. In other words, gene arrangement is highly conserved among Mytilus species.

cal. In this variable region, C. gigas and C. virginica have a
segment (between rrnS and trnY) that is completely absent
in C. hongkongensis. This is a totally striking finding regarding mt genome structure of Crassostrea. The segment contains split rrnL5', duplicated rrnS and four tRNA genes in
C. gigas, and split rrnL5' and seven tRNA genes in C. virginica, respectively. Additionally, there is obvious variation
of gene order in the C. virginica when compared with the
other two species: MNR is translocated between cox2 and
rrnS, and some tRNA genes are rearranged. Therefore, this
section seems to be an obvious "hot spot" of rearrangement in Crassostrea mt genome.

The major mt-genomic region significantly different
among the three Crassostrea genomes is that between cob
and nad2 (Fig. 2), with other regions being almost identi-

The relationship of genome length in the 3 Crassostrea species may be a reflection of the segment's loss: although C.
gigas is more closely-related to C. hongkongensis than to C.

virginica, the genome length difference between them
(1749 bp) is greater than that between C. gigas and C. virginica (982 bp). Similarly, the lack of duplicated rrnS in C.
virginica in this segment may account for the length difference between C. gigas and the C. virginica. As observed by
Rawlings et al. in Dendropoma, this kind of variation in
gene order within a genus is likely to be associated with

"hot spots" of rearrangements, and may be explained by
an intra-mt recombination model [13].
Although gene overlap is common in animal mt genomes,
there are only two such genes in C. hongkongensis mt
genome, nad4 overlaps with trnH by 1 nucleotide (Table
1), while in C. gigas and C. virginica there are no overlap-

ping genes [14]. Additionally, four protein-coding genes
directly abut each other as they do in C. gigas:nad5-nad6
and nad1-nad4L. In C. virginica, 8 genes abut each other:
cob-cox2 and atp6-nad2, in addition to the two pairs just
mentioned [5]. As usual, no introns were found, thus it is
likely that all of the genes from the coding strand are
expressed as a polycistronic RNA that is then processed
enzymatically to release the protein-coding genes'
mRNAs, as reported in a few cases [15]. Since tRNA secondary structures play a crucial role in RNA maturation
from the polycistronic transcripts, it is not clear by what
mechanism transcript cleavage would occur at the 3' end
of nad5, nad1 and cox1, as these are not flanked by tRNA
genes [16].
Noncoding regions between genes totaled to 1,561 bp in
length, with 608 bp in the MNR and another 953 bp dispersed in 29 intergenic regions (Table 1). The A+T composition of C. hongkongensis mt-DNA is 65.4%, lower than
that of many other invertebrates, but comparable to the
63.3% A/T composition of C. gigas mt-DNA, as well as
that of C. virginica (61.1%) and M. edulis (61.8%). This
A+T bias pattern holds for all protein-coding, tRNA, rRNA
genes while noncoding nucleotides except MNR, display
an even higher A+T content of 77.8%, significantly higher
than the 65.8% seen in C. virginica and 69.5% seen in the
Pacific oyster. Strand skew measures for the distribution
of base pairs show an AT skew [(T-A)/(T+A)] value of
0.134 and GC skew [(G-C)/(G+C)] value of 0.207, respectively, almost the same as those of C. gigas and very similar
to those of C. virginica [5,17]. This indicates that the

strand containing genes is quite rich in T and G in contrast
to that of other mollusks like Graptacme eborea, in which
the skew values are extremely close to zero [4]. The
observed G and T richness of the gene coding strand is evidence of codon usage bias.
Transfer RNA genes
In total, 21 tRNA genes plus a putative suppressor tRNA
gene were identified based on their respective anticodons.
Sequences complementary to the coding strand (including that for the suppressor tRNA) can form an expected
cloverleaf structure, with ranging in size from 65 to 75
nucleotides. As found in the other two Crassostrea mtsequences as well as in mtDNA of some other species
(Katharina tunicata, Cepaea nemoralis, M. edulis, M. galloprovincialis, Argopecten irradians), two serine and two leucine tRNA genes are differentiated in C. hongkongensis by
their anticodons (UUA for Leu1, CUA for Leu2, AGA for
Ser1, UCA for Ser2). Similarly, an additional trnM with a
cognate anticodon was also detected, as found in C. gigas,
C. virginica, V. philippinarum and Mytilus.

The new finding in this study is that trnC and trnN genes
are absent from the mt genome of C. hongkongensis (Fig.
2), a phenomenon not reported before for any other mollusk species with mitochondrial genome data available so
far, including Mizuhopecten yessoensis, which only has nine
identified tRNA genes, though. To confirm the absence of
these genes, the mt genome of one more individual of C.
hongkongensis was sequenced. Both tRNA genes (and
duplicated or split ribosomal gene) were still found

Page 5 of 13
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:477

absent in the second individual as well. Although tRNAs
play a crucial role in RNA maturation from polycistronic
transcripts, the number of distinct tRNA genes present in
mt genomes varies greatly across eukaryotes. Reportedly,
the loss of a tRNA gene (trnE) was detected also in Antarctic fish and it co-occurred with the loss of nad6 gene [18].
It is predominantly thought that the loss of tRNA genes is
ameliorated via import of nuclear tRNAs [19]. Comparison of gene order (including tRNA genes) between C.
hongkongensis and C. gigas shows that the two genomes are
almost identical, except for the segment between rrnS (the
one abutting trnP) and the trnY gene in C. gigas, which
(the segment) is absent from C. hongkongensis (Fig. 2).
This segment of C. gigas contains rrnL'5, duplicated rrnS,
and tRNA genes trnK, trnQ1, trnC and trnN; all of these
loci are absent in C. hongkongensis (thus C. gigas has 4
more tRNA genes than does C. hongkongensis). The
absence of the four tRNA genes and two duplicated or
split rRNA genes could be explained reasonably if we suppose that the ancestor of C. hongkongensis had this segment as C. gigas currently does and then it was lost
through DNA rearrangement. This is very likely an example of "tandem duplication-random loss (TDRL)" mechanism for gene rearrangement. Meanwhile, since extra
copies of other two tRNA gene trnK and trnQ are found
outside this region, their loss does not lead to a complete
absence of these two tRNA genes from the mitochondrial
genome.
Interestingly, a putative suppressor tRNA gene was identified. This suppressor tRNA has an anticodon sequence of
3'AUU, corresponding to nucleotides 8462–8527 of the
complete DNA sequence. It therefore is a nonsense suppressor, and could recognize the stop codon UAA in the
mRNA and, instead of terminating, insert an amino acid
at that position in the polypeptide chain [20]. A BLAST
search failed to identify any homologous sequence of the
putative suppressor tRNA gene, although the tRNA has a
predicted secondary structure similar to that of other
tRNAs. Lastly, as seen in C. gigas, C. virginica and many
other mollusk species, the Leu2 (UUA) tRNA gene contains the mitochondrial rRNA termination box, a quite
conserved heptamer TGGCAGA, at nucleotides 8 to 14
[21].
Protein-coding genes
Among the supposed 13 protein-coding genes, 12 were
identified in C. hongkongensis through open reading frame
(ORFs) searching. No atp8 coding sequence was detected
in this process. Boore [1] mentions that a lack of the atp8
gene is one of several unusual features of the Mytilus mt
sequence. The apt8 gene is missing from the mt-DNA of
almost all bivalve species studied so far, including C. gigas,
C. virginica, Mytilus, P. magellanicus, A. irradians, M. yessoensis and Acanthocardia tuberculata. The one exception

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/477

found so far is Hiatella arctica in which the apt8 gene is
present. Interestingly, V. philippinarum, originally not
annotated for gene atp8 in its mt-genome, was recently
found to contain a putative atp8 gene, though it apparently only encodes 37 amino acids and therefore has questionable gene function [7]. In contrast, all Gastropoda
species (14) studied to date possess an atp8 gene, and as
do all Cephalopoda species (11) examined up to now.
Other mollusk species, from Polyplacophora K. tunicata
to Scaphopoda G. eborea and Siphonodentalium lobatum,
have an atp8 gene as well.
The 12 genes in C. hongkongensis are similar in length to
their counterparts in Crassostrea. However, C. hongkongensis and C. gigas share a higher degree of amino acid similarity in 8 genes than do C. hongkongensis or C. gigas and
C. virginica. Also, a higher level of amino acid identity is
shared between C. hongkongensis and C. gigas than that is
seen between other pairs (Table 2). All protein-coding
genes start with typical invertebrate initiation codons,
with 8 employing ATG and the other 4 using ATA. Six protein-coding genes were terminated by a TAA and five by a
TAG codon, and one by an incomplete termination codon
T--, with its likely completion occurring by polyadenylation after transcript processing [15].
Amino acid identity in proteins for oyster pairs ranged
from as low as 47% between Cg-Cv in nad2 to as high as
98.7% between Ch-Cg in cox2. The overall level of the
identity among the three Crassostrea species varied from
51.3% (nad6) to 91.7% (cox1), significantly lower than
the corresponding values among three congeneric Mytilus
species. Just as the gene order is less conserved than that
in Mytilus species, Crassostrea species exhibit lower conservation of amino acid identity in all protein-coding genes
(Table 2). Amino acid identity is also much lower than
that found amongst five Drosophila species [5]. According
to our data (Table 2), it appears that the most conserved
protein-coding genes are cox1 and cox2 (identity > 90%),
and the least conserved are nad2, nad5 and nad6 (identity
< 60%, Table 2) in Crassostrea.
Gene order and pair analysis of genome rearrangements in
Crassostrea
It's well known that gene arrangements usually remain
steady over long periods of evolutionary time (especially
for protein-coding genes), in contrast to the significant
variation and rapid evolution of mtDNA sequences [1].
With some exceptions, mitochondrial gene order is relatively stable within major groups, and generally variable
among groups [22]. However, this appears not always to
be the case in mollusks. While mt-gene rearrangements
appear to be extensive in the major groups of mollusks,
Rawlings et al. reported that protein-coding gene rearrangements have occurred even within a genus (e.g. in the

vermetid gastropod Dendropoma), indicating that dramatic changes could also take place at the level of finescale phylogeny [13]. Several possible mechanisms have
been proposed to explain gene rearrangements in mt
genomes, including TDRL and "intra-mt recombination"
models. TDRL is believed to occur primarily in vertebrates, but it is likely to occur in mollusks as well, as exemplified putatively by the occurrence of the duplicated gene
block cox1-cox2-atp8-atp6 and cox3 as an intermediate
state in this process for Dosidicus gigas and Todarodes pacificus in Cephalopoda, and also by the absence of the segment of tRNAs-duplicated rRNA genes found in this study
as a consequence in the proceeding for C. hongkongensis
[23,24]. Furthermore, the occurrence and subsequent differentiation of duplicated tRNA genes and rRNA genes in
some species (such as C. gigas and C. virginica) may be
another consequence following this rearrangement. Since
this model cannot explain rearrangements in which a
gene moves from one strand to the other, intra-mt recombination is thought to account for both these rearrangements as well as gene loss. Theoretically, when two
proximate double-stranded breaks occur and the DNA circularizes to form mini-circles, segment loss often occurs;
if the circular piece is re-inserted into the genome, inversion (reversal) is easily produced [25,26]. These seem to
occur frequently in mollusks across groups and species.
According to available data, bivalves apparently have significantly great amount of mt gene rearrangement, with
gene translocation across all gene classes and very few
shared gene boundaries. On the other hand, loss of protein-coding genes is also a common phenomenon, as
mentioned above. It is known that some mt protein-coding genes were gradually lost, functionally and then physically, over long evolutionary periods of time. Physical
loss of the atp8 gene, for example, was first detected in
nematodes, and then in Mytilus, Crassostrea, M. yessoensis

and male mitotype of V. philippinarum, although a remnant of its ancestral gene was detected in C. virginica
[3,5,27-29]. Functional loss of atp8 was revealed in female
mitotype of V. philippinarum. In Antarctic fish, even the
nad6 gene was also lost [18]. Based on the situation mentioned above, it could be possible, as more data become
available, to find additional bivalve species lacking atp8 or
other genes, provided these genes are replaced by functional gene transfer to the nucleus [30].
Genome rearrangement studies are based on genomewide analysis of gene orders. The variation of mt gene
order occurred in Cassostrea were examined closely
through pair analysis of genome rearrangements and
direct comparison. It is shown that there are at least five
permutations between C. gigas and C. virginica (Fig. 3):
indel of trnQ1, trnK and duplicated rrnS; transposition of
trnN; transpositions of trnG, trnV andMNR; transpositions
of trnK1, trnC, rrnS and MNR; and transpositions of trnD,
trnM1, trnM2 and trnS2. However, only one single permutation is inferred between C. gigas and C. hongkongensis,
involving the indel of four tRNA genes (trnK1, trnC, trnQ1
and trnN) and two duplicated or split rRNA genes (rrnL5'
and rrnS), obviously. With three Cassostrea mtDNA
genomes, it was supposed to be able to find ancestral
genome scenario. However, the distinct feature (absence
of a DNA region) of C. hongkongensis mtDNA genome prevented the analysis of reconstructing rearrangement: only
the genes that all genomes involved have in common are
considered for analysis, i.e. repetitions or gaps (indels) in
genomes are excluded. As gene order of C. hongkongensis
and C. gigas would be the same if the indel between them
is excluded, pair analysis of genome rearrangements in the
three genomes would be actually conducted for two
genomes (Fig. 3) and hence no ancestral genome scenario
could be found for Cassostrea. Clearly, the rearrangement
distance of 5 between C. gigas and C. virginica is a great

value within a genus, indicating a high degree of rearrangements. Obviously, the distance between C. hongkongensis and C. gigas would normally be 1, even without
analysis.
The commonly occurred rearrangements are reversals and
block-interchanges (generalized transpositions). However, the latter should be the dominant one in bivalves
studied to date, because all these genomes have a single
transcriptional orientation, except for L. ornata. Clearly,

the absolute majority of block-interchanges must have
occurred in the "hot spot" region for the 3 Cassostrea
genoms (Fig. 3). That if this is true in other Cassostrea species could be verified when more mt DNA genomes
become available in the future.
Codon usages and codon bias
A total of 3704 amino acids are encoded by the C. hongkongensis mitochondrial genome, compared with 3718
and 3696 for its counterpart C. gigas and C. virginica,

Page 8 of 13

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:477

respectively. Similar to these two counterparts, leucine
(468) and serine (420) are the most frequently encoded
amino acids, followed by valine (334) and phenylalanine
(308); arginine (59) is the least frequent. Individually,
UUU (Phenylalanine) is definitely the most frequently
used codon not only in C. hongkongensis (7.7%), but also
in C. gigas (7.4%) and C. virginica (5.8%) as well, followed by AUU (Isoleucine) in the three species (5.7%,
5.8% and 5.2%, respectively).
Moreover, among 3704 codons in C. hongkongensis, 2788
(75.3%) end in an A or T, a more pronounced percentage
than that observed in the other two Crassostrea species
(71.0% and 64.7%, respectively) but a phenomenon
observed in the typical invertebrate codon bias. There is a
strong bias against the use of C (8.6%) at the third position nucleotide in all codons. In detail, for amino acids
with a fourfold degenerate third position, codon families
ending with T are the most frequently used, except in
serine1 and arginine codons. Codons ending with A are
used next most frequently. This is also the case for twofold
degenerate codons. In other words, in every case where an
amino acid can be specified by any NNY codon, the C.
hongkongensis has a much higher proportion of NNT:
NNC. At the second position, there is even a stronger bias
in favor of the use of T (42.5%), which is also true for C.
gigas (42.3%), C. virginica (43.0%) and M. edulis (43.5%).
While at the first codon position, T (30.9%) has the highest percentage followed by G (27.8%), so are the cases in
species mentioned above (Fig. 4).
Leucine can be specified by six different codons of TTR
and CTN, and the proteins of the Crassostrea species have
a very similar number of leucines (468, 461 and 472,
respectively). As the reflection of base bias in codons, C.
hongkongensis, together with C. gigas and C. virginica, has a
significantly greater percentage of leucines encoded by
TTA and CTT codons (with range of 53.2–67.0%), primarily at the expense of CTC and CTG codons. Similarly, in
the case of serine with 8 different codons (TCN and AGN),
a much higher proportion (with range of 60.1–65.5%) of
AT rich codons of TCT, AGA and TCA are clearly observed
in Crassostrea congeners.
Ribosomal RNA genes
BLAST searches assigned locations of the 12S and 16S
rRNA genes in the C. hongkongensis mt-genome. The 12S
rDNA is contained in a 948 bp region (6558–7505)
flanked by trnP and trnY, and as seen in C. virginica, but in
contrast to C. gigas, no duplicated small subunit rRNA
gene was detected. Alignment of the 12S rDNA from the
three oysters shows that there is a fairly homologous core
of 979 nucleotides at 78.3% identity (with 37 nucleotide
indels and 175 substitutions), corresponding to 6558–
7505 for C. hongkongensis, 3855–4800 and 5931–6879

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/477

(duplicated) for C. gigas, and 6847–7797 for C. virginica,
respectively. However, if only C. hongkongensis and C.
gigas are considered, the homologous core is 949 nucleotides long with 96.7% identity, with two indels and 29
substitutions, corresponding to 6558–7505, and 3855–
4800 and 5931–6879 (duplicated) in the genomes,
respectively.
The 16S rRNA gene is 712 bp long, flanked by proteincoding genes cox1 and cox3. Unlike the 16S rRNA gene in
C. gigas and C. virginica mt-DNA, it is not split or duplicated into two fragments (Fig. 2) [5]. The 16S rRNA gene
of C. hongkongensis and rrnL3' half of C. gigas shows nucleotide identity of 95.8% over 715 aligned bases (including
3 indels and 27 substitutions), while it is 82.4% between
C. hongkongensis and C. virginica over 721 nucleotide
alignment (including 11 indels and 116 substitutions).
Unlike the high identity of rrnS among three Crassostrea
(including the duplicated one in C. gigas), there is low
identity between rrnL3 and rrnL5 (36.4%) in C. gigas, perhaps a consequence of rrnL's modest evolutionary fragmentation, rather than duplication [31].
Noncoding regions
As in other two oysters and Mytilus, the C. hongkongensis
mt genome includes a large number of noncoding nucleotides, in contrast to G. eborea. Excluding the 3'UTR
sequences for protein-coding genes, there exist large intergenic segments in C. hongkongensis and 10 of which were
larger than 50 bp in length. Among these regions, a 608
nucleotide segment between trnG and trnV was putatively
identified as the major noncoding region (MNR; Table 1,
Fig. 1 and 2), on the basis of its noncoding characteristics
and A+T richness (77.8%), a feature typically used for
identification of the mitochondrial control region and
thought to contain replication origin [1]. Additionally,
several (A)n and (T)n homopolymer tracts were contained
in this region. The second largest intergenic sequence was
a fragment between suppressor tRNA gene and trnG, with
a length of 294 bp and A+T content of 70.8%. Alignment
of MNR between C. hongkongensis and C. gigas detected a
fragment of 60 bp long, with 90.0% sequence identity and
A+T content of 83.3% and 80.0%, respectively, or a
sequence of 51 bp in length, with 96.1% identity, A+T
content of 80.4% and 82.4%, respectively.

Conclusion
Although the arrangement of protein-coding genes of C.
hongkongensis's mt genome is identical with that of C. gigas
and C. virginica, and a moderate to high level of gene/
amino acid identity is shared among the three Crassostrea
species, C. hongkongensis exhibits a high degree of variation in gene order and gene content. The most striking of
these are the absence of the two tRNA gene trnC and trnN
and duplicated or split rRNA genes. Based on a compara-

tive analysis, we assume that the absence of these genes is
the result of evolutionarily loss of a genomic segment that
was present in the ancestor of Crassostrea, and a likely case
of "Tandem duplication-random loss" for genome rearrangement. While this novel and interesting feature of C.
hongkongensis and the comparison of mt-genomes among
the three Crassostrea species presented here have yielded
useful insights into possible mechanisms underlying variation of gene order and gene content change for Crassostrea, more information could be expected from mt-genome
studies of other oysters in Ostridae, promising intensive
understanding of gene order/content change, as well as
tRNA mutation and genome evolution for oysters and
other bivalves.

Methods
PCR and sequencing
Adductor muscle from a C. hongkongensis individual collected in Beihai, Guangxi province, China was used for
this study. Total genomic DNA was extracted using a
standard phenol/chloroform method [32]. Based on
alignment and comparison of complete mitochondrial
genome sequences of C. gigas and C. virginica, ten genusspecific primer pairs were designed for amplifications of
mtDNA large fragments in C. hongkongensis (Table 3), and
then the complete mitochondrial genome was amplified
in 10 overlapping large fragments accordingly (Fig. 1).
PCR was performed in 25-μl reaction volume, containing
2.0 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTP, 0.5 μM of each primer, 1.0
U Taq polymerase, 1× PCR buffer and 1μl template DNA.
PCR cycling condition were 94°C for 2 min; then 35
cycles of 94° for 1 min, annealing temperature for 1 min

and 72°C for 1.5 min; with a final step of 72°C for 5 min.
PCR products were checked by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel and purified using Qiagen PCR Purification kits
(Qiagen, USA). Purified products were then used as templates directly for cycle sequencing reactions. Species-specific primers were designed and used for primer walking
sequencing, which was performed for both strands of each
sample on an ABI 3730 DNA sequencer (ABI, USA). When
two mt tRNA genes was found absent in the individual of
C. hongkongensis sampled, the genome for one more individual was then sequenced for confirmation.
Sequence analysis and gene order comparison
During the processing of large fragments and those from
walking sequencing, regular and manual examinations
were used to ensure reliable overlapping and correct
genome assembly. Protein-coding and ribosomal RNA
genes were firstly identified using BLAST searches at GenBank, and then by alignment with previously published
mt genomes from species of Crassostrea, Mytilus and other
closely related mollusks [33]. Amino acid sequences of
protein-coding genes were inferred with ORF Finder using
invertebrate mitochondrial genetic code [34]. Identification of tRNA genes was conducted with tRNAscan-SE
using mito/chloroplast genetic code and default search
mode or setting the cove cutoff score to 1 when necessary
[35,36]. Potential cloverleaf structures for identified
tRNAs were determined in tRNAscan-SE. Comparisons of
mitochondrial gene order were conducted and facilitated
with published mollusk genomes from GenBank and
OGRe (the Organellar Genome Retrieval system) web site
[37-39]. Pair analysis of genome rearrangements was
