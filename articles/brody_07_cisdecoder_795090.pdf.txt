Background

Genome Biology 2007, 8:R75

information

Comparative genomic analysis of orthologous cis-regulatory
regions reveals that many contain multi-species conserved

sequences (MCSs; reviewed by [6-8]). Close inspection of
enhancer MCSs reveals that these sequences are made up of
smaller blocks of conserved sequences, designated here as
'conserved sequence blocks' (CSBs). EvoPrint analysis of
enhancer CSBs reveals that many have remained unchanged
for over 160 million years (My) of collective divergence [9]
(and see below). CSBs that are over 10 base-pairs (bp) long
are likely to be made up of adjacent or overlapping sequencespecific transcription factor DNA-binding sites. For example,
DNA-binding sites for transcription factors that play essential
roles in the regulation of the previously characterized Drosophila Krüppel central domain enhancer [10-12] are found
adjacent to or overlapping one another within enhancer CSBs
[9]. Although transcription factor consensus DNA-binding
sites are detected within CSBs, searches of 2,086 CSBs
(27,996 total bp) curated from 35 mammalian and 99 Drosophila characterized enhancers reveal that well over half of
the sequences do not correspond to known DNA-binding sites
and, as yet, have no assigned function(s) (this paper).

interactions

Tissue-specific coordinate gene expression requires multiple
inputs that involve dynamic interactions between sequence
specific DNA-binding transcription factors and their target
DNAs. The enhancer or cis-regulatory module is the focal
point of integration for many of these regulatory events.
Enhancers, which usually span 0.5 to 1.0 kb, contain clusters
of transcription factor DNA-binding sites (reviewed by [1-3]).
DNA sequence comparisons of different co-regulating
enhancers suggest that many may rely on different combinations of transcription factors to achieve coordinate gene regulation. For example, the Drosophila pan-neural genes
deadpan, scratch and snail all have distinct central nervous
system (CNS) enhancers that drive expression in the same
embryonic neuroblasts, yet comparisons of these enhancers
reveal that they have few sequences in common [4,5].

refereed research

A systematic approach is described for analysis of evolutionarily conserved cis-regulatory DNA
using cis-Decoder, a tool for discovery of conserved sequence elements that are shared between
similarly regulated enhancers. Analysis of 2,086 conserved sequence blocks (CSBs), identified from
135 characterized enhancers, reveals most CSBs consist of shorter overlapping/adjacent elements
that are either enhancer type-specific or common to enhancers with divergent regulatory
behaviors. Our findings suggest that enhancers employ overlapping repertoires of highly conserved
core elements.

cis-Decoder methodology for identification of conserved sequence
cis-Decoder methodology for identification of conserved sequence
elements shared among different enhancers. The cis-Decoder
methodology allows one to discover short 6 to 14 bp sequence elements
within conserved enhancer sequences that are shared by other
functionally related enhancers or are common to many enhancers with
divergent regulatory behaviors. These shared sequence elements or cDTs
can be used to identify and differentiate between cis-regulatory enhancer
regions that regulate different tissue-specific expression patterns. cisDecoder analysis involves the sequential use of the following webaccessed computer algorithms: EvoPrinter → EvoPrint-parser → CSB-aligner
→ cDT-scanner → Full-enhancer scanner → cDT-cataloger.

In order to initiate the functional dissection of novel CSBs and
to gain a better understanding of their substructure, we have
developed a multi-step protocol and accompanying computer
algorithms (collectively known as cis-Decoder; see Figure 1)
that allow for the rapid identification of short 6 to 14 bp DNA
sequence elements, called cis-Decoder tags (cDTs), within
enhancer CSBs that are also present in CSBs from other
enhancers with either related or divergent functions. There is
no limit to the number of enhancer CSBs examined by this
approach, which allows one to build large cDT-libraries. Due
to their different copy numbers, positions and/or orientations within the different enhancers, the conserved short
sequence elements may otherwise go unnoticed by more conventional DNA alignment programs. Because this approach
does not rely on any previously described transcription factor
consensus DNA-binding site information or any other predicted motif or the presence of overrepresented sequences,
cis-Decoder analysis affords an unbiased 'evo-centric' view of
shared single or multiple sequence homologies between different enhancers. The cDT-libraries and cis-Decoder alignment tools enable one to differentiate between functionally
different enhancers before any experimental expression data
have been collected. cis-Decoder analysis reveals that most
CSBs have a modular structure made up of two classes of
interlocking sequence elements: those that are conserved
only in other enhancers that regulate overlapping expression
patterns; and more common conserved sequence elements
that are part of divergently regulated enhancers.

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/5/R75

To demonstrate the efficacy of cis-Decoder analysis in identifying shared enhancer sequence elements, we show how cDTlibrary scans of different EvoPrinted mammalian and Drosophila enhancers accurately identify shared sequences
within enhancers involved in similar regulatory behaviors.
The cis-regulatory regions of the mammalian Delta-like 1
(Dll1) and Drosophila snail genes, which contain closely associated neural and mesodermal enhancers, were selected to
highlight cis-Decoder's ability to differentiate between
enhancers with different regulatory functions. We show how
a cDT-library generated from both mammalian and Drosophila enhancer CSBs can be used to identify enhancer typespecific elements that have been conserved during the evolutionary diversification of metazoans. Finally, we show how
cis-Decoder analysis can be used to examine novel putative
enhancer regions.

Results and discussion
Generation of EvoPrints and CSB-libraries
Our analysis of mammalian cis-regulatory sequences
included 14 neural and 21 mesodermal enhancers whose regulatory behaviors have been characterized in developing
mouse embryos. A full list of enhancers used in this study and
the references describing their embryonic expression patterns is given in Table 1. In most cases, their EvoPrints
included orthologs from placental mammals (human, chimp,
rhesus monkey, cow, dog, mouse, rat) or also included the
opossum; these species afford enough additive divergence
(≥200 My) to resolve most enhancer MCSs [13]. When possible, chicken and frog orthologs were also included in the EvoPrints. Except when EvoDifference profiles [9] revealed
sequencing gaps or genomic rearrangements in one or more
species that were not present in the majority of the different
orthologous DNAs, pair-wise reference species versus test
species readouts from all of the above BLAT formatted
genomes [14] were used to generate the EvoPrints.
Using the EvoPrint-Parser program, both forward and
reverse-complement sequences of each enhancer CSB of 6 bp
or greater were extracted, named and consecutively numbered. Based on their enhancer regulatory expression pattern, CSBs were grouped into two different CSB-libraries,
neural and mesodermal (Tables 1 and 2). Although there
exists a distinction between expression in either neural or
mesodermal tissues, each of the CSB-libraries represent a
heterogeneous population of enhancers that drive gene
expression in different cells and/or different developmental
times in these tissues. For this study, CSBs of 5 bp or less were
not included in the analysis. Although these shorter CSBs,
particularly the 5 and 4 bp CSBs, are most likely important for
enhancer function, the use of CSBs of 6 bp or larger (representing greater than 80% of the conserved MCS sequences) is
sufficient to resolve sequence element differences between
enhancers that regulate divergent expression patterns (see

below). A total of 286 neural CSBs and 289 mesodermal CSBs
were extracted from the mammalian enhancers (Table 2).
For Drosophila, three CSB-libraries, neural, segmental and
mesodermal, were generated from CSBs identified by EvoPrinting (Tables 1 and 2): neural enhancers included those
regulating both CNS and peripheral nervous system (PNS)
determinants; segmental enhancers included those regulating both pair-rule and gap gene expression; and mesodermal
enhancers included those regulating both presumptive and
late expression. Many of the D. melanogaster reference
sequences used to initiate the EvoPrints were curated from
the regulatory element database REDfly [15], while others
were identified from their primary reference (Table 1). The
collection of neural enhancers includes both those that direct
expression during early development, such as the snail [4],
scratch, and deadpan CNS and PNS enhancers [5], and late
nervous system regulators, such as the eyeless enhancer ey12
[16], which confers expression in the adult brain. The early
embryonic segmental enhancers represent pair-rule regulators such as the hairy stripe 1 [17] and even-skipped stripe 1
[18] enhancers, and gap expression regulators, such as the
hunchback enhancers [19,20]. The mesodermal enhancers
include those directing mesodermal anlage expression of
snail [4] and tinman [21], and late expressing enhancers,
such as those directing serpent fat body expression [22] and
mesodermal expression of Sex combs reduced [23]. The collective evolutionary divergence of all of the EvoPrints was

greater than 100 My and in most cases EvoPrints represented
over approximately 160 My of additive divergence. The average CSB length for both the Drosophila and mammalian CSBs
is 13 bp; the longest identified CSBs were 99 bp from the giant
(-10) segmental enhancer [15,24] and 95 bp from the Pairedlike homeobox-2b mammalian neural enhancer [25]. Complete lists of all CSBs identified in this study are given at the
cis-Decoder website [26].

Identification and use of cis-Decoder tags
As an initial step toward understanding the nature of the CSB
substructure, we have developed a set of DNA sequence alignment tools, known collectively as cis-Decoder, that allow
identification of 6 bp or greater perfect match identities,
called cDTs, within two or more CSBs from either similar or
divergent enhancers. The cDTs, which range in size from 6 to
14 bp with an average of 7 or 8 bp, are organized into cDTlibraries that identify sequence elements within CSBs of the
same CSB-library. In addition, common cDT-libraries that
represent sequence elements aligning to CSBs of two or more
different CSB-libraries were also organized.
Mammalian CSB alignments, using the CSB-aligner program, yielded 336 neural specific and 60 neural-enriched
cDTs and analysis of the mammalian mesodermal CSBs
yielded 258 mesodermal specific and 55 mesodermal
enriched cDTs (Table 2). The CSB alignments also produced
137 cDTs that are common to both neural and mesodermal

Dll1 encodes a Notch ligand that is essential for cell-cell signaling events that regulate multiple developmental events
(reviewed by [32]). Studies in the mouse reveal that Dll1 is
dynamically expressed in specific regions of the developing
brain, spinal cord and also in a complex pattern within the
embryonic mesoderm [33,34]. The 1.6 kb Dll1 cis-regulatory
region, located 5' to its transcribed sequence, has been shown
to contain distinct enhancers that direct gene expression in
these different tissues [35]. These studies have identified two
highly conserved neural enhancers, designated Homology I
(H-I) and Homology II (H-II), and two mesodermal enhancers termed msd and msd-II. The H-I enhancer directs expres-

refereed research

Cross-library CSB alignments revealed that nearly all CSBs
contain cDTs that are either shared by CSBs from divergent
enhancer types or found only in CSBs from enhancers with
related regulatory functions. For example, the 37 bp neural
mastermind #10 CSB (TATTATTACTATATACAATATGGCATATTATTATTAC) contains a 9 bp sequence (first
underlined sequence) also found in the 20 bp #8 CSB from the
dpp mesodermal enhancer [15,28] and it also contains a 14 bp
sequence (second underlined sequence) that constitutes the
entire 14 bp #33 CSB from the neural enhancer region of nerfin-1 ([29] and unpublished results).

Although the resolution of cis-Decoder analysis increases as
more enhancers and/or enhancer types are included in the
CSB and cDT alignments, our analysis of mammalian enhancers found that many shared sequence elements can be identified among related enhancers when as few as two different
enhancer groups are used to generate specific cDT-libraries.
This is a particularly useful feature of cis-Decoder, especially
when studying a biological process or developmental event
where relatively little is known about the participating genes
and their controlling enhancers. To demonstrate the ability of
cis-Decoder to analyze relatively small subsets of enhancers,
we show how cDT-libraries generated from 14 neural and 21
mesodermal mammalian enhancers can be used to distinguish between the neural and mesodermal enhancers that
regulate embryonic expression of Dll1.

deposited research

Although each mammalian and fly cDT is present in at least
two or more enhancers, most are not found as repeated
sequences in any of the enhancers. In addition, one of the
principle observations of our analysis is that enhancers of
similarly regulated genes share different combinatorial sets of
elements that are enhancer-type specific (see below).

enhancers identifies multiple shared elements with
other related vertebrate embryonic enhancers

reports

The constituent sequence elements of the different cDTlibraries are dependent on the enhancers used to identify
them. As additional CSBs are included in the cDT-library construction, certain cDTs may be re-designated. For example,
some that are currently considered neural specific will be discovered to be neural enriched, and others that are part of
enriched libraries may be reassigned to common cDT-libraries.

The analysis of both the mammalian and fly common cDTlibraries reveals that many cDTs contain core recognition
sequences for known transcription factors. However, when
additional flanking CSB sequences are considered, many
common transcription factor binding sites become tissue specific cDTs. For example, the DNA-binding site for basic helixloop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors, the E-box motif
CAGCTG (reviewed by [30]) is present 22 times in different
neural CSBs, and 2 and 4 times within the CSBs of segmental
and mesodermal enhancers, respectively. However, when
flanking sequences are included in the analysis, such as the
sequences CAGCTGG, CAGCTGAT, CAGCTGTG, CAGCTGCA, CAGCTGCT and ACAGCTGCC, all are neural specific
cDTs (E-box underlined). It has been previously shown that
different E-boxes bind different bHLH transcription factors
to regulate different neural target genes [31]. Although transcription factor consensus DNA-binding sites are well represented in the cDT-libraries, greater than 50% of the cDTs in
all of the libraries, both mammalian and fly, represent novel
sequences whose function(s) are currently unknown. The fact
that there exists such a high percentage of novel sequences
within these highly conserved sequences indicates that the
identity, function and/or the combinatorial events that regulate enhancer behavior are as yet unknown.

reviews

To search for enhancer sequence element conservation
between taxa, we generated neural and mesodermal cDTlibraries from the combined alignments of mammalian and
fly CSBs (Table 2) and many of the cDTs in these libraries
align to both mammalian and fly CSBs. For example, the 11 bp
neural specific cDT (CAGCTGACAGC) aligns with CSBs in the
vertebrate Math-1 [27] and Drosophila deadpan [5] early
CNS enhancers. All CSB-, cDT-libraries and alignment tools
are available at the cis-Decoder website.

CSBs. Alignments of the Drosophila enhancer CSBs yielded
444 neural specific cDTs (showing no hits on mesodermal or
segmental enhancer CSBs), 284 segmental enhancer specific
cDTs and an additional 451 cDTs found in neural and segmental enhancers but not part of mesodermal CSBs (Table 2).
We also identified 451 cDTs that were enriched in neural and/
or segmental CSBs but were also found at a lower frequency
in mesodermal enhancer CSBs. From the mesodermal CSBs
analyzed, 169 mesodermal specific cDTs (not in neural or segmental enhancer CSBs) were identified along with 104 additional cDTs enriched in mesodermal enhancers but also
found at a lower frequency among neural and/or segmental
enhancer CSBs. A common cDT-library was also generated
that contains 993 cDTs that represent common sequence elements found in CSBs of both neural and mesodermal
enhancers.

cDT-cataloger analysis of aligning cDTs with H-I and H-II
early CNS enhancers revealed that the H-I enhancer shares a
remarkable 9 different sequence elements with the Wnt-1
early CNS neural plate enhancer CSBs [36], representing 62
bp (32%) of the H-I CSB coverage, 7 elements with the Pairedlike homeobox-2b (Phox2b) hindbrain-sensory ganglia
enhancer CSBs (23% coverage) and 6 sequence elements
(20% coverage) with the Sox9p hindbrain-spinal cord
enhancer CSBs [37] as well as numerous other neural specific
elements in common with CSBs of other neural enhancers
(Figure 4; Additional data file 1). Comparisons of Dll1 H-I,
Wnt-1, Phox2b and Sox9p enhancer CSBs reveal that the ori-

Previous cross-taxa comparative studies have demonstrated
that, in many cases, the regulatory circuits controlling the
spatial-temporal regulatory activities of certain enhancers
have been conserved over large evolutionary distances (discussed in [1]). For example, the Deformed autoregulatory element from Drosophila functions in a conserved manner in
mice [39] and its human ortholog, the Hox4B regulatory element, provides specific expression in Drosophila [40]. Given
this degree of conservation, we reasoned that cDT-libraries
built from the combined alignments of enhancer CSBs from
both mammalian and Drosophila CSB-libraries would lead to
the discovery of additional enhancer type-specific sequence
elements and thereby enhance our understanding of the relationship between evolutionarily distant enhancers (Table 2).
By including all of the neural enhancer CSBs (286 mammalian and 601 Drosophila) in the CSB alignments, the total
number of neural specific cDTs increased to 873 compared to
336 mammalian and 322 Drosophila neural specific cDTs
(Table 2). The combined mesodermal specific cDT-library
(Table 2) also increased compared to the individual mammalian and fly libraries. The combined mammalian and fly neural and mesodermal specific cDT-libraries contain cDTs that
align with both mammalian and fly CSBs and cDTs that align
exclusively with only mammalian or fly CSBs. Whether the
'cross-taxa' cDTs indicate significant functional overlap
remains to be tested. However, a cDT-scan of the EvoPrinted
Dll1 cis-regulatory region, using the cross-taxa libraries, identifies multiple conserved sequence elements that are shared
with CSBs from functionally related fly enhancers (Figure 5),
suggesting that many of the core cis-regulatory elements that
participate in enhancer function are conserved across taxonomic divisions.

reports

An EvoPrint of the Dll1 cis-regulatory region reveals clustered CSBs in each of the enhancer regions (Figure 2). Here,
EvoPrint analysis used mouse (reference DNA), human, rhesus monkey, cow, rat, opossum and Xenopus tropicalis
orthologs, representing over approximately 240 My of collective evolutionary divergence. EvoPrint-parser CSB extraction of the EvoPrint generated a total of 35 CSBs of 6 bp or
longer, representing 83% of the total MCS. A cDT-scan of the
four Dll1 enhancer regions using the mammalian neural and
mesodermal specific cDT-libraries accurately differentiates
between the neural and mesodermal enhancers (Figure 3;
note intra-CSB sequences are not shown). The cDT-library
scan identified 77 type-specific sequence elements within the
Dll1 CSBs and over half (52%) align with three or more CSBs
from different enhancers, indicating that, even if Dll1 had
been excluded from the analysis that generated the specific
cDT-libraries, there would still be extensive coverage of the
Dll1 CSBs by type-specific cDTs. All but eight of the CSBs contain elements that align with one or more neural or
mesodermal specific cDTs. The H-I and H-II early CNS
enhancers exhibited 64% and 43% coverage, respectively, by
neural specific cDTs. The CSBs of the two mesodermal
enhancers, msd and msd-II, exhibited 48% and 56% coverage, respectively, by one or more mesodermal specific cDTs.
When common cDTs, shared by mesodermal and neural
enhancers, were taken into account, coverage of all four
enhancers was 81% (data not shown).

entation and order of the shared cDTs are unique for each of
the enhancers (data not shown). The H-I and H-II enhancer
CSBs also share the 7 bp sequence element GCTCCCC, and HI has a repeat sequence element (AGTTAAA) that is present in
two of its CSBs (#11 and #13). The conserved AGTTAAA repeat
is also part of a CSB in Phox2b enhancer [25]. cDT-cataloger
analysis of the mesodermal enhancer cDT hits (Figure 4;
Additional data file 1) reveal that, together, msd and msd-II
share 7 elements in common with the mesodermal enhancer
of Nkx2.5 [38] as well as numerous elements in common with
CSBs of other mesodermal enhancers (Figure 2; Additional
data file 1).

sion to the ventral neural tube, while the H-II enhancer
primarily drives Dll1 expression in the marginal zone of the
dorsal region of the neural tube [34]. The msd enhancer
drives expression in paraxial mesoderm, and msd-II directs
Dll1 expression to the presomitic and somitic mesoderm.

As part of our study of Drosophila enhancers, we carried out
cis-Decoder analysis of 38 segmentation enhancers
responsible for both gap and pair-rule gene expression during
Drosophila embryogenesis. Although the segmentation
enhancer specific library consisted of only 284 cDTs, these
cDTs aligned with over 70% of bases of the CSBs of segmentation enhancers. As an example of alignment of these cDTs
with a segmental enhancer, we present an alignment of segmentation specific cDTs with the hairy stripe 1 enhancer
(Additional data file 2). cis-Decoder recognizes highly conserved Abdominal-B, HOX, Hunchback, Kruppel and Tramtrack binding sites, as well as additional uncharacterized

refereed research

Many of the snail enhancer CSB-cDT hits represent
sequences found only in two CSBs, snail itself and one other.
In these instances it appears that these elements, although
specific for neural or mesodermal CSBs, are relatively rare
when compared to others. Only through analysis of additional
enhancers will it be clear whether these rare elements are
indeed type-specific or only enriched in the type-specific
CSBs. Nevertheless, the fact that the sequence elements identified by these rare cDTs are conserved in two distinct
enhancer CSBs that have both been under positive selection
for over 160 My of collective divergence merits their inclusion
in the analysis.

deposited research

To identify sequence elements within the snail upstream
CSBs that are present in CSBs of other functionally related or
unrelated enhancers, we carried out a cDT-scan of the snail
EvoPrint using the neural, segmental and mesodermal specific cDTs and the enriched cDT-libraries (Figure 7). Within
the snail early CNS neuroblast enhancer region, our cDTlibrary scan identified 22 different neural and neural/segmental cDT hits, distributed among all but one of the CSBs,
covering 73% of the CSBs. Interestingly, 10 of the 22 cDTs
that align with the early CNS enhancer CSBs are found in
CSBs of both neural and segmentation enhancers. The high
percentage of neural/segmental cDT hits most likely reflects
the fact that this enhancer initially drives snail expression in
the neuroectoderm in a pair-rule pattern and then in a segmental pattern corresponding to the first wave of delaminating neuroblasts [4]. cDT-cataloger analysis of the aligning
cDTs reveals that many of the identified sequence elements
are also part of other early neuroblast enhancer CSBs. For
example, the 9 bp cDTs ATTCCTTTC, ATTGATTGT, ATTGTGCAA, TGCAATGCA and GATTTATGG are also present,
respectively, in CSBs from the nerfin-1, biparous, string,
scratch and worniu neuroblast enhancers (Figure 8; see
Table 1 for references).

In the snail early PNS enhancer region, 5 of the 7 CSBs
aligned with a total of 15 different cDTs that cover 69% of the
total PNS CSB sequence (Figure 7). Similar to the CNS
enhancer CSB cDT alignments, close to half of the PNS cDT
hits represent sequence elements within both neural and segmental enhancer CSBs, again most likely a reflection of the
segmental structure of the PNS. The significant overlap in
cDTs found in both CNS and PNS enhancer CSBs may reflect
the likelihood that many early neural specific transcriptional
regulatory factors are pan-neural.

reports

To demonstrate the ability of cis-Decoder to differentiate
between Drosophila neural and mesodermal enhancers, we
show an analysis of the snail upstream cis-regulatory region.
The enhancers that regulate snail's dynamic embryonic
expression have been mapped to a 2,974 bp upstream DNA
fragment [4,41]. An EvoPrint of this sequence reveals that
each of the restriction fragments that contain the different
enhancer activities (CNS, mesodermal and PNS) harbor clusters of highly conserved CSBs (Figure 6). The combined evolutionary divergence of the snail upstream EvoPrint
(generated from Drosophila melanogaster, D. sechellia, D.
yakuba, D. erecta, D. ananassae, D. pseudoobscura, D.
mojavensis, D. virilis and D. grimshawi orthologous
sequences) is approximately 160 My, suggesting that many, if
not all, of the identified CSBs are likely to be genus invariant
and that each base-pair within a CSB has been evolutionarily
challenged.

Within the presumptive mesodermal enhancer CSBs, 11 cDTs
mesodermal specific aligned with 5 of the 12 CSBs, covering
40% of the CSBs (Figure 7). Like the neural cDTs, some of the
mesodermal cDTs contain putative DNA-binding sites for
classes of known transcription factor families. For example,
the seventh cDT (TAATTGGA) contains a consensus core
DNA-binding sequence (underlined) for Antennapedia class
homeodomain factors [42] (reviewed by [43]).

aligned with cDTs from the vertebrate neural and mesodermal cDT-libraries described in Table 2. Designations adjacent to the aligned cDTs indicate the
number of perfect matches to CSBs within neural (n) or mesodermal (m) enhancers analyzed in this study. Transcription factor DNA-binding site searches
of the Delta-like 1 CSBs and their aligning cDTs revealed that many contained putative binding sites and, in several cases, the shared sequence elements
correspond exactly to, or had significant sequence overlap with, the characterized binding sites. For example, several cDTs that align to H-I enhancer CSBs
correspond to known binding sites: these include a YY1 binding site (GCCATTT), an E-box (CAGATG; reviewed by [30]), a variant Oct1 site
(ATGAAAAT) and a predicted core Lef-1 binding site (underlined) within a cDT (GCAAAGA). Within H-II conserved sequences, one common and one
neural specific cDT aligned with the E-boxes (CAGGTG and CAGCTG), respectively.

Although higher specificity is obtained by alignment with
cDTs of 7 bases or greater, we have found that it is not unusual
for 80% of CSBs associated with neural expressed genes to
align with neural-specific cDTs versus only 20% of the CSBs
in the same putative enhancer regions aligning with mesodermal-specific cDTs even when 6 base long cDTs are included in
the analysis (data not shown). As the size and specificity of
these libraries grow, their use as predictors of enhancer function will most likely increase as well.

deposited research

The Full-enhancer scanner is used to identify less conserved
repeated cDTs by rescanning the entire enhancer sequence
with the aligning cDTs. For example, a Full-enhancer scan of
the even-skipped stripe 1 enhancer with its aligning cDTs
reveals that the #15 CSB (AATCCTTTCG) is present two additional times within the intra-CSB sequences (Figure 9). Interestingly, this CSB contains the consensus binding sequence
for Tramtrack (underlined), a regulator of segmental gene
expression [49]. EvoDifference analysis reveals that the 5'
most inter-block (AATCCTTTCG) is conserved in all Drosophila species except D. ananassae and the 3' inter-block
repeat is absent in six of the ten species used to generate the
EvoPrint (data not shown).

During embryonic development, HLHmβ expression is activated in the ventral neurogenic ectoderm immediately prior

the time of the first wave of neuroblast delamination(stages
9-10) and in neuroblasts (Figure 1 of [55]). Our EvoPrint
analysis of the 883 bp enhancer region (Figure 10a) revealed
that 338 bases were highly conserved, and over 90% of these
were found in CSBs of 6 or more bases. Alignment of Drosophila neural-specific and mesodermal-specific cDTs
revealed that 11 of the 15 HLHmβ CSBs aligned with a total of
28 neural specific cDTs, while only 1 of its CSBs aligned with
a single mesodermal specific cDT (Figure 10b,c). Both proneural transcription factors and the Notch pathway, acting
through the Su(H) transcription factor, are implicated in the
regulation of E(spl) complex genes (reviewed by [56]).
Among the cDTs aligning with the CSBs, one, GCATGTGC,
contains an E-box (underlined), the focus of activity of
proneural transcription factors, and two others, TTTCCCA
and TCCCAC, align with the consensus Su(H) binding site.

reports

Previous studies have demonstrated that certain enhancers,
particularly those controlling the dynamic expression of
developmental genes, contain clusters of DNA-binding site
motifs for specific transcription factors (for example, see
[44,45]; reviewed by [46]). Comparative genomic studies of
orthologous enhancers have also revealed that, within a binding site cluster, individual DNA-binding sites can undergo
turnover (discussed in [47,48]). This loss of and/or gain of
transcription factor docking sites during evolution suggests
that the repeated motifs may be functionally redundant and
that the stability of any one binding site is most likely due to
selective pressure(s) to maintain: total number of binding
sites for tight spatial/temporal regulation; functional interactions between a bound factor and adjacent factors and/or;
competition between antagonistic regulatory factors for overlapping binding sites. For example, overlapping/linked binding sites have been identified in the 3' most CSB of the
Krüppel central domain enhancer [9,10]. The 15 bp CSB
(CTGAACTAAATCCG) contains overlapping sites for the
transcriptional activator Bicoid and repressor Knirps proteins [11]. In vivo experiments reveal that these interlocking
sites are functionally important [12]. Additional binding sites
for both of these factors are also present in the Krüppel
enhancer but not all are found in CSBs (data not shown).

Full-enhancer scanner identifies less conserved repeated
cDTs and CSBs

libraries, we have examined a number of genes both in Drosophila and vertebrates using EvoPrinter and cDT-library
scans. Our analysis reveals that putative enhancer regions
associated with CNS-expressed genes align with a higher proportion of neural-specific cDTs than with mesodermal-specific cDTs. For example, cis-Decoder analysis of the
immediate upstream regions from Drosophila E(spl) region
transcript mβ (HLHmβ) [50] and of the human gene encoding Tuberoinfundibular peptide of 39 residues (TIP39) [5153] revealed that both of these neural expressed genes had
significant coverage by neural-specific cDTs of their proximal
cis-regulatory region CSBs. Figure 10 shows cis-Decoder
analysis of HLHmβ, while our analysis of TIP39 is presented
in Additional data file 3.

Conclusion

refereed research

For example, sub-libraries of the Drosophila neural specific
library can be generated to identify neuroblast- and PNS-specific tags. Enhancer CSB analysis using cDT-libraries generated from the combined alignments of both mammalian and
fly CSBs also suggests that many of the sequence elements
represented by the different cDTs have been conserved across
taxonomic divisions and may represent core elements used by
many metazoans to direct tissue-specific gene expression
patterns.

deposited research

cDT-library scans of EvoPrinted cis-regulatory DNA reveal
that it is possible to differentiate between functionally different enhancer types before any experimental/expression data
are known. For example, cDT-library scans of the mammalian
Dll1 or Drosophila snail cis-regulatory DNA sequences accurately differentiate between neural and mesodermal enhancers (Figures 3 and 7). cDT-library scans of co-regulating
enhancers, using multiple libraries, reveal the combinatorial
complexity of the cis-regulatory sequence elements involved
in coordinate gene expression. Our studies indicate that many
co-regulating enhancers rely on different combinations of the
tissue-specific cis-regulatory elements to achieve synchronous regulatory behaviors. Although not highlighted in this
paper, information gleaned from the cDT-scans and subsequent cDT-cataloger analysis of multiple co-regulating
enhancers can be used to construct 'higher resolution' cDTlibraries that harbor many, or most, of the sequence elements
that direct coordinate gene expression.

reports

Evaluation of the cis-Decoder method was also carried out by
examining the contribution that each enhancer made to the
cDT-libraries. As one adds new enhancer CSBs to a specific
library, the number of cDTs increases, such that alignment
coverage of enhancer type-specific CSBs also increases. We
illustrate the contribution of each enhancer to the specific
cDT-libraries in our study (Additional data file 4). Overall, for
Drosophila enhancers, prior to their inclusion in a library, on
average 41% of the conserved nucleotides of enhancers align
with the tissue specific cDT-library appropriate for that
enhancer, while after inclusion in a library, 65% of the conserved nucleotides align. For example, addition of the
bearded proneural enhancer [57], consisting of 21 CSBs (a
total of 303 bp), to the Drosophila neural-specific CSB library
resulted in 26 new neural-specific cDTs that were shared with
at least one other neural enhancer. Prior to its inclusion, coverage of the bearded CSBs by alignment of neural-specific
cDTs was 43%, while after its inclusion in the cDT-library
preparation the alignment coverage of its CSBs increased to
67%. Addition of new enhancers to the out-group, used to
remove common cDTs from a specific library, also enhances
the specificity of the type-specific library and frequently shifts
cDTs from specific to enriched libraries. Taken together,
increased specificity of an enhancer-type cDT-library can be
achieved either by including new similarly regulated enhancers in the generation of the cDT-library or increasing the
number of out-group CSBs used to remove non-specific cDTs.
Ideally, both approaches should be pursued to increase the
depth and resolution of a particular cDT-library.

solely on conserved sequences, the probability that cisDecoder analysis dissects functionally important DNA is
greatly enhanced. Most of the 2,086 CSBs identified in this
study have undergone negative selection during more than
160 My of collective evolutionary divergence. Alignment of
hundreds of CSBs from both similarly regulating enhancers
and functionally different enhancers assures that conserved
cis-regulatory elements shared by as few as two enhancers are
identified and included in the analyses. Our cDT-scans show
that most CSBs have a modular organization made up of
smaller overlapping/interlocking sequence elements that
align with CSBs of other enhancers. A typical CSB is made up
of both enhancer type-specific sequence elements and
common elements that are found in enhancers with different
regulatory functions and, surprisingly, more than half of all of
the shared CSB sequence elements do not correspond to know
transcription factor DNA-binding sites and, as of yet, are
functionally novel.

reviews

mammalian, consisted of conserved sequence blocks within
exons of genes that are not predominantly expressed in the
CNS (data not shown). For this analysis we use the percent
coverage of CSBs by cDTs, as used above for the analysis of
Dll1 enhancers in which we counted the percent of the bases
in the CSBs that aligned with cDTs. Whereas Drosophila and
mammalian neural-specific cDTs, including hexamers, cover
approximately 56% and 70%, respectively, of CSBs from neural enhancers, alignment with control CSBs was 20% or less.
Again, when the alignment was repeated with cDTs of 7 bp or
greater the CSB coverage of neural sequence was 5-fold
greater than that observed with the control datasets. Taken
together, our cDT alignments demonstrate their utility in
identifying enhancer type-specific conserved sequence
elements.

Figure analysis of the Drosophila snail cis-regulatory region
EvoPrint 6
EvoPrint analysis of the Drosophila snail cis-regulatory region. An EvoPrint of the Drosophila snail upstream early CNS, presumptive mesodermal, and early
PNS enhancer regulatory region (2,974 bp) [4,41] was generated using the following genomes: D. melanogaster (reference sequence), D. sechellia, D. yakuba,
D. erecta, D. ananassae, D. pseudoobscura, D. virilis, D. mojavensis and D. grimshawi. Due to breaks in co-linearity, sequencing gaps and/or sequencing
ambiguities, as detected by EvoDifference analysis, D. simulans and D. persimilis were not included in the analysis. Invariant MCSs, shared by all species, are
identified with uppercase black-colored letters. The three previously identified genomic restriction fragments [4] containing the CNS, mesodermal and
PNS enhancers are highlighted by solid lines for neural enhancers and dotted lines for the mesodermal enhancer.

Although we have initially generated cDT-libraries from general classes of different enhancer types, this approach should
be applicable to the analysis of gene co-regulation in any cell
type involved in any biological event. As the variety and depth
of the different cDT-libraries increase, we believe that cDT-

library scans of EvoPrinted putative enhancer regions will
have great utility for the identification and initial characterization of cis-regulatory sequences. Future efforts that address
the role of individual enhancer CSBs and the dissection of
their modular elements will undoubtedly yield new insights

CSB-aligner is a Java applet that allows one to identify short

cis-Decoder [26] is a six-step integrated series of protocols
and web-based algorithms that can be used to identify evolutionarily conserved DNA sequences that are shared among
different enhancers (Figure 1). The following sections provide
a detailed description of each step of the cis-Decoder procedure: EvoPrint analysis [58], for the discovery of MCSs; EvoPrint-parser, for CSB extraction and annotation; CSBaligner, for the identification of shared elements between
CSBs; cDT-scanner, to reveal cDT positions and their relations to other cDTs within CSBs; Full-enhancer scanner, for
the discovery of less-conserved repeated cDTs or CSBs within
enhancers; and cDT-cataloger for the identification of
enhancers with shared sequence elements. A more detailed
description of these steps is given at the cis-Decoder website.
The Java applets CSB-aligner, cDT-scanner, Full-enhancer
scanner and cDT-cataloger are available on-line at the cisDecoder website and can be downloaded to the users computer to avoid Java-web browser incompatibilities. In our experience, a current version of the Mozilla browser avoids many

interrupted by sequence gaps to optimize alignments, EvoPrinter outputs a single uninterrupted sequence to reveal
CSBs as they exist in a species of interest. In Drosophila,
when 9 or more species are used to generate an EvoPrint, the
combined mutagenic histories of all of the orthologous DNAs
represent an excess of 160 My of collective evolutionary divergence, thus affording near base-pair resolution of the functionally important DNA within the species of interest
(discussed in [9]). Likewise, EvoPrint analysis of orthologous
DNAs that include placental mammals (human, chimpanzee,
rhesus monkey, cow, dog, rat and mouse), and, optionally, the
opossum, detects CSBs that have been maintained for over
200 My of collective divergence. The EvoPrinter and EvoDifference print analysis algorithms and companion protocols

used to produce an EvoPrint of the Drosophila melanogaster 800 bp even-skipped stripe #1 enhancer [18]: D. melanogaster (reference sequence), D. simulans,
D. sechellia, D. erecta, D. ananassae, D. persimilis, D. pseudoobscura, D. virilis, D. mojavensis and D. grimshawi. Drosophila yakuba was not included in the EvoPrint
analysis due to lack of sequence co-linearity detected with EvoDifference prints. Invariant MCSs, shared by all species used to generate the EvoPrint, are
identified with uppercase black-colored letters. A Full-enhancer scan of the enhancer with one of its 10 bp CSBs (blue highlight) revealed that it is repeated
two additional times in the less conserved inter-block sequences (lowercase yellow highlighted sequences). Note that the underlined sequence in this CSB
is the core DNA-binding sequence for the Tramtrack transcription factor.

enhancers are placed in the lower window of the CSB-aligner.
A box associated with the lower window of the CSB-aligner
allows for the naming of the CSBs introduced into the lower
box and selection of the minimum aligned length (6, 7 or 8
base windows have been routinely used). Output length of the
alignments produced by CSB-aligner can be selected (default
value 100 bases).
Output of the CSB-aligner consists of the CSBs that were
input into the lower window aligned with the CSBs that were
introduced into the upper window. The CSB-aligner does not
record CSB self-alignments. A second output window, the
results table, is a list of the aligned matches along with their
positions. Each of the output columns of the results table can
be sorted by selecting the column header of the column to be
sorted. Contents of results tables can be copy-pasted into
Microsoft Word.
The CSB-alignment can be saved as an HTML file. Saving the
HTML file allows copy pasting from the saved file into
Microsoft Word and, once in Word, the file can be reformatted and saved or printed as the original readout. The CSBalignment program has functioned successfully with the
introduction of thousands of CSBs in both windows. The following CSB-libraries were created from EvoPrints of enhancers listed in Table 1: mammalian neural, mammalian
mesodermal, Drosophila neural, Drosophila mesodermal
and Drosophila segmental.

Interpreting the CSB-aligner readout and generation of
cDT-libraries
A cDT is a short sequence element of 6 bp or greater that is a
perfect match to sequences within CSBs that are present in
two or more enhancers. A cDT-library represents a collection
of cDTs that are shared by the various enhancers examined.
Two types of cDT-libraries have been generated in this study.
First, a 'tissue-specific library' contains cDTs that are shared
by a group of enhancers that regulate similar expression
patterns but are absent from a second set of enhancers that
direct expression in tissues outside of the first group. Second,
a 'common cDT-library' contains cDTs that were shared
between sets of enhancers of divergently regulated genes. A
subset of common libraries included 'enriched' libraries that
had a three-fold greater representation from one enhancer
type (for example, neural) than from a second type (for example, mesodermal).

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/5/R75

All libraries were generated from readouts of the CSBaligner. Making enhancer-type specific libraries requires two
different CSB-libraries generated from functionally different
enhancers, a library from the tissue of interest (for example,
neural), and a second library that serves as an 'out-group' (for
example, mesodermal). For the generation of a neural cDTlibrary, neural CSBs in both forward and reverse directions
were copy-pasted into both upper and lower windows of CSBaligner. The resulting cDTs from this alignment are listed in
the 'Result of CSB alignment table' of the CSB-aligner output,
in the column titled 'Motif.' Since this cDT list contains multiple copies of different cDTs, the extra copies are removed
using the Java applet Puzzamatic 1.0 [59], a freeware created
by Ron Surratt. The cDT list that contains all unique cDTs is
then alphabetized and sorted by size also using Puzzamatic
1.0. The cDTs, constituting a raw neural cDT-library, were
then copy/pasted into a Microsoft Word document. A second
CSB-alignment is then performed with the neural CSBs in the
top window of CSB-aligner, and mesodermal CSBs in the
lower window. The cDTs from this alignment were freed of
extra copies as above. These cDTs constituted an unedited
common neural/mesodermal cDT-library. The unedited neural and common cDT-libraries are combined and cDTs common to the two libraries (present in the first and second
alignments) are removed using the JavaScript program cDTcleaner [60], thus leaving only the neural-specific sequences.
Neural enriched and common cDTs were curated from the
unedited shared cDT-library.
For Drosophila, segmental, neural (treating CNS and PNS
specific enhancers together), and mesodermal specific cDTlibraries were generated. The out-group for neural and segmental cDT-libraries was the mesodermal CSB-library, and
the out-group for the mesodermal cDT-library was neural
CSBs. For mammals, neural and mesodermal cDT-libraries
were generated. All cDT-libraries are listed in Table 2 and full
libraries are available online [26].

Identification of shared elements within enhancers
with the cDT-scanner
The function of cDT-scanner is to determine the relationship
between any enhancer and any other group of MCSs used to
generate the CSB libraries. cDT-scanner aligns the cDTs con-

tained within various cDT-libraries with CSBs within an EvoPrint. cDT-scanner is a Java applet that uses a variant of the
cis-Decoder aligner; it looks for only perfect matches between
cDTs and CSB sequences. Alignment of cDTs using cDT-scanner is accomplished by first pasting a cDT-library in the upper
window of cDT-scanner and then pasting the EvoPrint or
CSBs to which they are to be aligned in the lower window. The
output of cDT-scanner consists of perfect matches of cDTs
aligned under the input CSBs. Since each library consists of
cDTs shared by different enhancers, cDT-scanner portrays
the shared elements within each CSB. A cDT-scanner alignment should be saved; information from saved files can be
copy-pasted into Microsoft Word without loss of formatting
features. For details on how to format cDT-alignments, see
the website. A second output window for the cDT-scanner, a
results table, is a list of the aligned matches along with their
positions. Selecting the output column header sorts the
results under that header. Contents of results tables can then
be copy-pasted into Microsoft Word.

Finding less-conserved sequence elements
The 'Full-enhancer scanner' is a Java applet that identifies
additional repeated cDT or CSB sequences within less conserved sequences flanking CSBs of enhancers. For this alignment, cDTs or CSBs present within an enhancer can be
curated from the output of cDT-scanner termed 'Results from
cDT-scan.' Curate both forward and reverse/complement
sequences and paste into the upper window of Full-enhancer
scanner. The EvoPrinted enhancer should be copy-pasted
into the lower window. The program aligns to both conserved
and non-conserved sequences of the EvoPrint.

Identification of enhancers that share conserved
elements using cDT-cataloger
cDT-cataloger uses a variant of the CSB-aligner; it records
only perfect matches between CSBs and cDTs of a specified
size. The output lists those CSBs containing perfect sequence
matches to the cDTs, and can be used to identify enhancers
and count the number of times each cDT aligns with any CSBlibrary. Cataloguing is accomplished by copy-pasting the
CSB-libraries (both forward and reverse directions) into the
upper window of the cDT-cataloger and the selected cDTs of
a single uniform size in the lower window. The size of the
cDT(s) must be entered into the window provided.
