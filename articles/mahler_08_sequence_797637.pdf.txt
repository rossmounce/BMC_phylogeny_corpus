Abstract
Background: Mus spretus diverged from Mus musculus over one million years ago. These mice are
genetically and phenotypically divergent. Despite the value of utilizing M. musculus and M. spretus
for quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping, relatively little genomic information on M. spretus exists,
and most of the available sequence and polymorphic data is for one strain of M. spretus, Spret/Ei. In
previous work, we mapped fifteen loci for skin cancer susceptibility using four different M. spretus
by M. musculus F1 backcrosses. One locus, skin tumor susceptibility 5 (Skts5) on chromosome 12,
shows strong linkage in one cross.
Results: To identify potential candidate genes for Skts5, we sequenced 65 named and unnamed
genes and coding elements mapping to the peak linkage area in outbred spretus, Spret/EiJ, FVB/NJ,
and NIH/Ola. We identified polymorphisms in 62 of 65 genes including 122 amino acid
substitutions. To look for polymorphisms consistent with the linkage data, we sequenced exons
with amino acid polymorphisms in two additional M. spretus strains and one additional M. musculus
strain generating 40.1 kb of sequence data. Eight candidate variants were identified that fit with the
linkage data. To determine the degree of variation across M. spretus, we conducted phylogenetic
analyses. The relatedness of the M. spretus strains at this locus is consistent with the proximity of
region of ascertainment of the ancestral mice.
Conclusion: Our analyses suggest that, if Skts5 on chromosome 12 is representative of other
regions in the genome, then published genomic data for Spret/EiJ are likely to be of high utility for
genomic studies in other M. spretus strains.

Background
Mus spretus mice are derived from wild mice collected in
Southern France, Spain and Northern Africa [1,2]. M. spretus diverged from Mus musculus one to three million years
ago[3,4]. Recent data suggest that these mice are reported
to have an average of one sequence variant every 50 bp
[5]. Strains of M. spretus are frequently utilized in combination with M. musculus strains in quantitative trait loci
(QTL) studies due to the high degree of sequence and phenotypic diversity between the strains[6,7]. Indeed, M. spretus mice have been valuable for the identification of loci
contributing to differences in immune response and
inflammation [8-10]. M. spretus strains are also cancer
resistant in comparison to several M. musculus strains and
have been utilized for mapping of cancer susceptibility
loci [11-16].
Unlike some of the other commonly used strains of mice
for QTL mapping, none of the M. spretus strains have been
fully sequenced. Few reports of comparisons of sequence
diversity within M. spretus strains exist, and most have
been generally limited to one gene or small genomic
region [17-19]. The majority of the sequence, microsatellite, and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data
available for M. spretus mice are from Spret/Ei; for
researchers using non-Spret/Ei strains of M. spretus, such
as SEG/PAS mice, there is limited strain-specific information available in public databases.
In previous studies, we observed a large difference
between M. musculus and M. spretus strains in susceptibility to chemically-induced skin cancer. M. spretus mice
chemically treated with 7, 12-dimethylbenz [a]anthracene
(DMBA) and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate
(TPA) develop no skin papillomas after 20 weeks of treatment but M. musculus strains, such as NIH/Ola and FVB/
N, develop an average of 20 or more papillomas [11]., To
identify loci for skin cancer susceptibility we created four
F1 backcrosses between M. spretus (Spret/EiJ, STF/PAS,
outbred spretus) and M. musculus (FVB/NT, NIH/Ola)
mice. Fifteen regions of linkage were identified [1113,20,21]. One locus, skin tumor susceptibility 5 (Skts5), a
region on chromosome 12 with peak linkage at 17 cM
showed strong evidence of linkage in one F1 backcross
NIH/Ola × F1(NIH/Ola × outbred spretus).
As one means of identifying potential skin cancer susceptibility candidate genes at Skts5, we sequenced all predicted genes in four of the strains used for linkage NIH/
Ola, FVB/NJ, outbred spretus, and Spret/EiJ. Exons that
contained amino acid alterations between the strains were
sequenced in two additional strains of M. Spretus (SEG/
PAS and STF/PAS) as well as FVB/NT (FVB/N mice, Taconics). Here, we describe the results from over 140 kb of
sequence data from Skts5, 40.1 kb of which was

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/626

sequenced in seven strains, and a phylogenetic comparison of the relatedness of four M. spretus strains.

Results
Confirmation of Skts5 as a skin tumor susceptibility locus
Skin tumor susceptibility 5 (Skts5) was originally mapped as
a skin tumor susceptibility locus to mouse chromosome
12 in a genome wide linkage analysis for skin cancer in an
F1 backcross between NIH/Ola and outbred spretus mice
[11,12]. We performed additional crosses between skin
tumor resistant mice (Spret/EiJ, STF/PAS) and skin tumor
susceptible mice (NIH/Ola, FVB/NT) to further test this
locus for linkage [13,20,21]. We observed no evidence for
linkage at Skts5 in the interspecific backcross NIH/Ola ×
[STF/PAS × NIH/Ola] or in the Spret/EiJ by FVB/NT F1
interspecific backcross. The linkage analysis for the Spret/
EiJ by NIH/Ola F1 interspecific backcross (approximately
80 mice) was inconclusive for linkage at Skts5. To refine
the linkage region in the NIH/Ola × outbred spretus backcross, we genotyped additional markers on chromosome
12. Linkage analyses showed a peak LOD score of 3.2 at
approximately 17 cM (35 Mb; Figure 1).

Outbred spretus mice are not bred to homogeneity and
segregate different polymorphisms and haplotypes across
the genome. However, there was no evidence from the
original linkage data generated from nine different outbred spretus fathers using 18 polymorphic markers for heterogeneity at Skts5. To further rule out the possibility of
heterogeneity within these mice at Skts5, we genotyped
seven additional microsatellite markers mapping to the
peak linkage region of Skts5 in DNA from six non-littermate outbred spretus male mice. We observed no evidence
of genetic heterogeneity (data not shown). From these
results we felt reasonably confident that there was no
genetic heterogeneity within our outbred spretus mouse
colony at this locus.
Identification of variants between M. musculus and M.
spretus
In order to identify polymorphic coding variants that fit
the linkage data for Skts5, we first identified all known
coding and non-coding genes at the peak region for linkage on chromosome 12 (between 31.7 and 47.9 Mb,
Ensembl build 50) using genetic maps from the UCSC
Genome Browser, Ensembl and Entrez Gene databases.
Maps were updated and throughout our project to include
newly mapped genes. At the conclusion of this study, 65
coding elements including ten hypothetical genes/coding
elements, nine snoRNAs and one microRNA were identified as mapping within Skts5 (see Additional file 1). We
designed PCR primers flanking all exons for the genes or
coding elements mapping to Skts5. When multiple splice
forms of a gene were predicted, we sequenced exons representing all splice variants.

Figure data
Linkage 1 at Skts5
Linkage data at Skts5. Eighteen markers mapping to chromosome 12 were genotyped in 351 NIH/Ola × (NIH/Ola ×
spretus outbred) backcross mice. Analysis using WinQTLcart
shows two peak linkages. Skts15 maps to proximal chromosome 12 and Skts5 maps to chromosome 12 with a peak linkage at ABI marker E_29.924 (35 Mb, 17 cM). The one
negative lod confidence interval is marked by a dotted line.
To carry out a screen for coding differences between the
resistant strain of mice (outbred spretus) and the susceptible strain (NIH/Ola) that could be candidate variants for
Skts5, we initially sequenced DNA from NIH/Ola, FVB/NJ,
Spret/EiJ, and one outbred spretus animal. Exons containing amino acid variants were then sequenced in FVB/NT,
SEG/PAS and STF/PAS. Variants shared between outbred
spretus and STF/PAS were eliminated as candidates since
STF/PAS does not show evidence for linkage at Skts5 in the
NIH/Ola backcross. PCR product was obtained from both
M. spretus and M. musculus DNA for all exons which rules
out the possibility of large deletions in one strain of mice
at this locus. Our analysis did not rule out the possibility
of causal variants in regulatory regions or duplication or
inversion copy number polymorphisms at this locus.
Analysis of sequence alignments of forward and reverse
reads of 140,448 bp from genes and coding elements
mapping to Skts5 led to the identification of 1,123 polymorphisms between M. musculus and M. spretus strains
(Tables 1, 2 and Additional file 2). Of these, 122 resulted
in amino acid substitutions, 121 occurred between M.
musculus and M. spretus strains and one occurred between
NIH/Ola and FVB/NJ. There were six sequence differences
identified between FVB/NJ and NIH/Ola, but no differences between FVB/NT and NIH/Ola.
Characterization of nucleotide substitutions at Skts5
To further characterize the nucleotide variants, we analyzed polymorphisms on a gene by gene basis. The
number of polymorphisms identified per gene ranged
from no changes to 65. The rate of substitution per nucleotide ranged from 3/3593 (0.08%) in Nova1 to 8/133
(6%) in SNORNA17 (Ensembl ENSMUSG00000077294).

Because synonomous changes are less likely to affect protein function, these were not evaluated further in the other
strains of mice used in the linkage crosses [22-24]. A catalogue of the types and locations of polymorphisms (Table
3: see Additional file 2) at Skts5 include the following
changes: nonsense (1), missense (122), small insertion/
deletions (14), 5'UTR (89), 3'UTR (404) and potential
splice-site alterations (23). To determine if the type of
substitutions identified at Skts5 could shed light on the
evolutionary forces between M. spretus and M. musculus,
we looked at the number and percentages of nucleotide
changes and the type of mutations (transitions versus
transversions) in this data set (see Additional file 2). The
transition to transversion ratio was approximately 2.0
(Figure 2). Given that C to T (G to A) transitions are a
common mutation type due to the CpG methylation
deamination process; these data are consistent with other
large sequence comparisons[25,26].
Identification of variants within M. spretus
We rationalized that in order for a bi-allelic polymorphism to be considered a candidate for Skts5 that the cancer resistant strain (outbred spretus) would have one allele
and the susceptible strain (NIH/Ola) would have the
other. In addition, closely related strain STF/PAS that does
not show evidence for linkage at Skts5 should not share
alleles with outbred spretus. Of the 121 amino acid substitutions identified between M. musculus and M. spretus,
three variants were present in Spret/EiJ but not the other
M. spretus strains (Table 1). To rule out a sequencing or
PCR artifact for those variants, new PCR product was generated and sequenced. All variants were confirmed as
being unique to Spret/EiJ. Of the other 118 amino acid
variants which were polymorphic between NIH/Ola and
M. spretus, 99 were shared in all M. spretus strains analyzed
and 19 were polymorphic between different M. spretus
strains (Table 1). Eight variants fit our criteria for candidacy based on the linkage data (Table 4).
Conservation of amino acid alterations
Just as non-synonomous changes have a greater likelihood of affecting protein function than synonomous
changes, non-synonomous changes that occur in a evolutionarily conserved residue are more likely to be functionally significant [27,28]. To assess amino acid
polymorphisms for potential functional significance, proteins were compared using Ensembl ortholog prediction
alignments between M. musculus and Homo sapiens, Pan
troglyodytes, Gallus gallus, Rattus norvegicus, Canis familiaris,
Bos Taurus, Xenopus tropicalis, Takifugu rubripes, and Monodelphis domestica when protein homologies existed http://
www.ensembl.org. If only one amino acid in the orthologous protein position was present in at least eight of the
nine non-musuclus species examined, we considered that
position to be strongly conserved. Twenty-four amino

acids showed strong conservation by this criterion (see
Additional file 3).
In addition to sequence alignments, we assessed amino
acid polymorphisms for potential functionality through a
sequence homology-based tool Sorting Intolerant From
Tolerant (SIFT)[28]. Using SIFT, the majority of amino
acid polymorphisms were scored as tolerant substitutions.
Surprisingly, a few amino acids that appear to be highly

conserved across species, such as Pik3cg Ala405Thr, were
scored as well-tolerated substitutions using SIFT. Eight
variants were identified that were scored as intolerant substitutions by SIFT (scores 0.05 or less). These variants
include Ahr Phe348Leu, Ankmy2 Ile369Thr, Sostdc1
Cys15Ser, Ifrd1 Leu449Phe, EG629820 Gly47Ser,

comparison studies (see Additional file 3). Seven additional variants in other genes had SIFT scores of less than
0.15 and may have mild functional effects (Table 2).
Of the 22 amino acid alterations that were polymorphic
within M. spretus strains, four showed amino acid substitutions that were considered to be intolerant using SIFT
(Table 5). These changes all occurred in genes for which
there is limited homology data for other species which
may lead to over prediction of intolerance by SIFT. Five

other substitutions resulted in SIFT scores of 0.15 or lower
including 1110049B09Rik Pro691Ala and Lrrn3
Ala69Gln. Polymorphisms in highly conserved amino
acids may result in functional differences in these proteins
and could account for phenotypic differences between M.
spretus strains.
Polymorphisms at splice sites
Variants that fall at highly conserved splice acceptor or
splice donor sites may also affect protein function due to

alterations in splicing. Twenty-four variants mapped
within 3 bp of a splice site. To test whether these variants
affected splicing, we isolated tail RNA from NIH/Ola, outbred spretus and Spret/EiJ and performed RT-PCR using
primers from flanking exons. Identically sized bands of
roughly the same intensity were observed in all of the
strains for nineteen of the primer sets tested indicating
that these variants are unlikely to affect splicing (data not
shown). Five variants were not tested for effects on splice
site alterations because the variations mapped to the first
or last exon of the gene.

interested in using this information to determine the
degree of relatedness between M. spretus strains. We therefore conducted maximum parsimony analyses on exon
sequence for Spret/EiJ, SEG/PAS, STF/PAS and outbred
spretus to FVB/NJ, and NIH/Ola utilizing Phylip 3.66 [30].
We did not include FVB/NT in the analysis as we did not
identify any sequence differences between FVB/NT and
NIH/Ola. We included 40,122 bp from coding and flanking exonic regions across Skts5 on mouse chromosome 12
which represented sequence from 90 exons from 35 genes
with the identified amino acid alterations and the noncoding polymorphisms within them. DNA variants were
all weighted equally. A maximum parsimony tree was
generated from the data which was identical to a consensus tree from 100 bootstrap reiterations (Figure 3). As
expected, the greatest phylogenetic distance occurred
between the M. musculus and M. spretus groups. The fewest
number of polymorphisms occurred between the M. musculus strains FVB/NJ and NIH/Ola (FVB/NT) mice. These
data suggest that the inbred Swiss-derived strains are more
closely related than the wild-derived M. spretus strains.
Within M. spretus strains, Spret/EiJ and outbred spretus
were the most closely related, and STF/PAS mice showed
the most divergence from the other M. spretus strains.
Nonetheless, of the roughly 13,300 amino acids assessed
in all four M. spretus strains only 0.17% (22 amino acids)
were polymorphic between M. spretus strains. If Skts5 is
representative of the genome as a whole, then most single
nucleotide polymorphism data available for Spret/EiJ
from coding regions will have utility for other M. spretus
strains.

Discussion and Conclusion
To our knowledge, this is the largest sequence-based comparison of multiple strains of M. spretus. Based on

sequence comparison of over 40 kb across a 15-Mb region
on chromosome 12, M. spretus strains are more closely
related to each other than to the Swiss-inbred strains of M.
musculus. Outbred spretus and Spret/EiJ have the highest
sequence similarity. This is not unexpected as both of
these M. spretus mice strains were derived from wild mice
isolated from the same region of Spain. STF/PAS mice are
derived from mice isolated in Tunisia. This strain showed
the highest divergence from the other M. spretus strains
and was the M. spretus strain most closely related to the
Swiss-derived M. musculus mice. These data fit with the
geographical ascertainment of the lines of M. spretus as the
other M. spretus strains all come from Spain.
In this dataset we observed an average of one polymorphism every 130 bp between M. musculus and M. spretus.
This is less than half as frequent as previous reports of
sequence variance between M. musculus and M. spretus [5].
However, this data set was almost entirely restricted to
coding regions with only minimal amounts of flanking
intronic sequence. Genes are under different mutation
constraints than non-functional intragenic regions and
therefore show fewer variants [31]. Within the 65 genes
analyzed in this study, 31 had no amino acid polymorphisms, 19 genes had one to three amino acid variants
and 15 genes had greater than four amino acid variants.
Despite the number of non-synonomous changes, the
majority of amino acid variants identified in this study
were not predicted to show functional consequences
using SIFT. Genes and amino acids that showed lower
SIFT tolerance scores are being considered as candidates
for skin cancer susceptibility.
We conducted this analysis to identify candidate genes for
Skts5. From our criteria based on the linkage, a number
polymorphisms were identified that were consistent with

the linkage (Table 4, Additional file 2). These include
eight amino acid changes that were found in outbred spretus that were not seen in STF/PAS including three that
have SIFT scores below 0.10. These variants will be considered as candidates for the linkage. However, the nucleotide driving linkage at Skts5 may also be in a nonsequenced regulatory or intragenic region and may affect
gene expression or stability. There is also the small possibility that undetected heterogeneity at Skts5 exists
between the outbred spretus mice and we have not
sequenced the genome containing the resistance allele.
Future studies will address these possibilities.
The five genes that showed the highest number of amino
acid polymorphisms (Cog5, Slc26a3, Ahr, Zfp277,
1110049B09Rik) do not share any known function and do
not map next to each other at Skts5. Ahr (aryl hydrocarbon
receptor) mediates the toxicity of dioxin compounds, particularly polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons [32]. It has a
large number of reported amino acid variants in both
mouse and humans. Some variants within Ahr have been
associated with differences in chemical toxicity in mouse
and man [33-35] and in modest effects on cancer risk in
humans [36,37]. One of the amino acids identified in our
study shows a very low SIFT score and may therefore affect
Ahr function, however this variant was observed in all M.
spretus strains and is therefore not considered to be a candidate for Skts5. Two Ahr variants, Asn533Ser and
Asn544Asp, fit with the linkage data but are not predicted
to be functionally significant by SIFT. Cog5 is part of the
conserved oligomeric Golgi (cog) complex and has been
postulated to mediate Golgi trafficking. Two amino acid
polymorphisms have been reported in human but none
in mouse. Little is known about Zfp27. Slc26a3 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that transports sulfate in the
lower gut. Slc26a3 has two amino acids reported in

human and none in mouse. The function of
1110049B09Rik is not known, but the purported human
homologue, FLJ23834, has a large number of reported
amino acid alterations as well (seven in mouse; six in
humans). It is possible that the higher rate of amino acid
substitution in these genes reflects some underlying selection pressures between M. musculus and M. spretus.

A number of potentially functional interesting variants
were identified that do not fit with the linkage data. The
only species in which the Sostdc1 amino acid variant
Cys15Ser was observed was in M. spretus. It is not known
if substitution of a cysteine at position 15 with serine in
the M. spretus isoform results in altered disulfide bond formation, disruption of other secondary structure or other

Phylogenetic tree from sequence data at Skts5. Phylogenetic tree generated by parsimony analysis of four M. Spretus and two Swiss-derived M. musculus strains. DNAPars
program from Phylip 3.66 was used to generate a parsimony
tree from 40.1 kb of sequence data from mouse chromosome 12 derived from six of the seven mouse strains.
Because no sequence differences existed between FVB/NT
and NIH/Ola these mice were grouped on the tree. The four

the greatest divergence within M. spretus.

functional consequence. Another interesting polymorphism is in 4921508M14Rik. This gene contains a stop
codon at position 109 in all of the M. spretus strains theoretically resulting in a truncated protein missing the 37
terminal amino acids. The function of this gene is
unknown. EG629820, which contains several amino acid
variants thought to be functional by SIFT, is a predicted
gene that has shown expression differences of unknown
biological consequence in a number of murine studies
[38].
There was a relatively low degree of sequence variation
between the M. spretus strains; however we identified
twenty-two changes that resulted in intra-spretus amino
acid polymorphisms. Thus, based on this dataset, nearly
twenty percent of the amino acid alterations identified
between M. spretus and M. musculus are polymorphic
within M. spretus. In contrast, sequencing results from the
two Swiss-derived M. musculus strains identified only one
amino acid that was polymorphic between the FVB/NJ
strain and NIH/Ola. Sequence comparison of three

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/626

closely related M. musculus strains: NIH/Ola, FVB/NT and
FVB/NJ revealed only six of 140,448 basepairs (0.004%)
that were polymorphic between NIH/Ola and FVB/NJ.
There were no sequence differences identified between
FVB/NT and NIH/Ola. Because sequence variants exist
between FVB/NT and FVB/NJ, researchers comparing
results across studies should be aware of which strain of
FVB/N is used. Our results confirm previous studies in
which variations in coding regions were more common in
wild-mice than in laboratory-derived strains [7], perhaps
reflecting differences in breeding and selection pressure.
Our data comparing sequence diversity between M. spretus
strains may not be representative of genome as a whole
since this study was limited to one locus on chromosome
12 and included only genes, predicted coding elements,
and small amounts of flanking intronic sequences. In this
study, we conducted our sequence comparisons by analyzing only exons in which we initially identified an
amino acid variation between outbred spretus, Spret/EiJ,
FVB/N, and NIH/Ola. There may be additional amino
acid variations at Skts5 in which Spret/EiJ, outbred spretus
and NIH/Ola share an allele that is different from the
other strains of M. spretus. We also cannot rule out the
possibility that Skts5 may have unique genomic properties
compared to other loci. Previous studies have reported
different phylogenetic trees when comparing sequence
samples from across the genome (global comparison)
with gene-specific phylogenetic trees (local comparison)[39]. Skts5 may represent a region with unique local
characteristics between M. spretus strains. For instance,
Skts5 may be under differential evolutionary constraints
against sequence divergence in M. spretus strains. Nonetheless, our data suggest that genomic data and single
nucleotide markers in the database for Spret/EiJ, particularly intragenic SNPs, are more likely to be shared with
other M. spretus strains than with M. musculus strains,
increasing the utility of the publicly available SNP maps
for studies utilizing any M. spretus mouse.

Methods
Animal material
The ancestral and laboratory origins of each of the mice in
the study are as follows: SEG/PAS (Grenada, Spain, inbred
line maintained by the Institute Pasteur), STF/PAS (Fondouk el Djedid, Tunisia, inbred line maintained by the
Institute Pasteur), Spret/EiJ (Puerto Real, Ibiza, Spain,
inbred line maintained by the Jackson Laboratories), outbred spretus (Spain, outbred line maintained by Stephen
Brown, PhD of the Medical Research Council, Harwell,
England), FVB/NT (Switzerland, inbred line maintained
by Taconics, US), FVB/NJ (Switzerland, inbred line maintained by the Jackson laboratories) and NIH/Ola (Switzerland, inbred line maintained by Harlan Olac, UK). DNA
was isolated from tails or spleens of outbred spretus, NIH/

Ola and FVB/NT mice using standard methods [40].
Spret/EiJ and FVB/NJ DNA was purchased from the Jackson Laboratories. STF/PAS and SEG/PAS DNAs were a gift
from Xavier Montagutelli, DVM, PhD of the Institut Pasteur.
Linkage analysis and genotyping of markers at Skts5
To refine linkage at Skts5 in the outbred spretus × NIH/Ola
backcross ten additional single nucleotide polymorphisms from chromosome 12 were genotyped in mice at
Applied Biosystems. Genotypes of the new markers were
combined with previously genotyped microsatellite markers D12Mit182, D12Mit242, D12Mit60, D12Mit153,
D12Mit154, D12Mit2, D12Mit68, and D12Mit5. Quantitative trait locus analysis using WinQTLCart [41] was conducted on the genotypes of the 18 markers on 351
intercross mice using skin papilloma number as the trait.
To rule out genetic heterogeneity within outbred spretus
mice at Skts5 (15–19 cM), we genotyped seven additional
markers
(D12Mit243,
D12Mit187,
D12Mit146,
D12Mit186, D12Mit222, D12Mit61 and D12Mit62) in
six different outbred spretus fathers, Spret/EiJ, NIH/Ola,
and NIH/Ola × outbred spretus F1 and STF/PAS.
PCR primer design, sequencing and analysis
Intron/exon boundaries of all genes and coding regions
mapping to Skts5 were identified using the Ensembl database, builds 35–48. When multiple splice forms of a gene
were present, exons from all splice forms were included in
the analyses. We designed PCR primers using Integrated
DNA Technology's SciTools PrimerQuest web-based program [42]. Primer sequences and PCR conditions are
listed in Additional file 4. PCR products were treated with
Exo/SAP-IT to remove single stranded DNA (USB). Automated sequencing of PCR products was conducted on an
ABI 3700 by standard methods. Primers used for PCR
were also used for the sequencing. Forward and reverse
sequences were analyzed and compared using DNAstar
3.0. The sequence traces were inspected visually whenever
a nucleotide substitution was indicated. When a polymorphism was identified between FVB/NJ and Spret/EiJ, PCR
products from additional strains NIH/Ola, FVB/NT, outbred spretus, SEG/PAS and STF/PAS were sequenced.
Evolutionary comparison
Sequence alignments between M. musculus and other species were obtained from the Ensembl database when
homologies were present. Tolerance scores were generated
using the SIFT program and entering in the NCBI protein
G numbers for each M. musculus gene at Skts5 [29]. SIFT
sorts intolerant amino acid substitutions from tolerant
substitutions by protein based alignments from other species. A tolerance score of 0 to 1.0 is generated for each
amino acid variant. Low tolerance indices (less than 0.05)
are suggested of non-tolerated (deleterious or functional)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/626

amino acid substitutions. Higher tolerance indices indicate that an amino acid substitution is less likely to have
functional consequences.
Splicing Studies
RNA was isolated from tails of NIH/Ola, Spret/EiJ and
outbred spretus mice using standard Trizol methods per
manufacturer's recommendations (Invitrogen). One
microgram of RNA was reversed transcribed using the
Iscript cDNA synthesis kit (Biorad) according to manufacturer's directions. PCR primers were designed in exons
flanking the potentially aberrantly spliced exon. Primer
sequences and PCR conditions are listed in Additional file
4. Genomic DNA from the mice was used as a negative
control. PCR products were run on 1.5% agarose gels for
comparison of product sizes.
Phylogenetic comparison
Maximum DNA parsimony analyses were conducted
using sequence from exons that were sequenced in all
strains of mice using the DNAPars program included in
the Phylogeny Interference Package (Phylip) version 3.66
[30]. All nucleotide changes were weighted equally. To
assess support for the most parsimonious tree, we also
performed a bootstrap analysis and compared the resulting consensus tree to the most parsimonious tree. This
resulted in an identical tree. We used the program Drawgram in Phylip 3.66 to construct a phylogenetic tree from
this data without using branch length considerations.
