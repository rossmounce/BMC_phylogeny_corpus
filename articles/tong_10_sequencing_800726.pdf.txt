Abstract
Background: Recent studies generating complete human sequences from Asian, African and European subgroups
have revealed population-specific variation and disease susceptibility loci. Here, choosing a DNA sample from a
population of interest due to its relative geographical isolation and genetic impact on further populations, we
extend the above studies through the generation of 11-fold coverage of the first Irish human genome sequence.
Results: Using sequence data from a branch of the European ancestral tree as yet unsequenced, we identify
variants that may be specific to this population. Through comparisons with HapMap and previous genetic
association studies, we identified novel disease-associated variants, including a novel nonsense variant putatively
associated with inflammatory bowel disease. We describe a novel method for improving SNP calling accuracy at
low genome coverage using haplotype information. This analysis has implications for future re-sequencing studies
and validates the imputation of Irish haplotypes using data from the current Human Genome Diversity Cell Line
Panel (HGDP-CEPH). Finally, we identify gene duplication events as constituting significant targets of recent positive
selection in the human lineage.
Conclusions: Our findings show that there remains utility in generating whole genome sequences to illustrate
both general principles and reveal specific instances of human biology. With increasing access to low cost
sequencing we would predict that even armed with the resources of a small research group a number of similar
initiatives geared towards answering specific biological questions will emerge.

Background
Publication of the first human genome sequence heralded a landmark in human biology [1]. By mapping out
the entire genetic blueprint of a human, and as the culmination of a decade long effort by a variety of centers
and laboratories from around the world, it represented a
significant technical as well as scientific achievement.
However, prior the publication, much researcher interest
had shifted towards a ‘post-genome’ era in which the
focus would move from the sequencing of genomes to
interpreting the primary findings. The genome sequence
has indeed prompted a variety of large scale post-genome efforts, including the encyclopedia of DNA elements (ENCODE) project [2], which has pointed
towards increased complexity at the levels of the

genome and transcriptome. Analysis of this complexity
is increasingly being facilitated by a proliferation of
sequence-based methods that will allow high resolution
measurements of both and the activities of proteins that
either transiently or permanently associate with them
[3,4].
However, the advent of second and third generation
sequencing technologies means that the landmark of
sequencing an entire human genome for $1,000 is
within reach, and indeed may soon be surpassed [5].
The two versions of the human genome published in
2001, while both seminal achievements, were mosaic
renderings of a number of individual genomes. Nevertheless, it has been clear for some time that sequencing additional representative genomes would be
needed for a more complete understanding of genomic
variation and its relationship to human biology. The
structure and sequence of the genome across human
populations is highly variable, and generation of entire

genome sequences from a number of individuals from
a variety of geographical backgrounds will be required
for a comprehensive assessment of genetic variation.
SNPs as well as insertions/deletions (indels) and copy
number variants all contribute to the extensive phenotypic diversity among humans and have been shown to
associate with disease susceptibility [6]. Consequently,
several recent studies have undertaken to generate
whole genome sequences from a variety of normal and
patient populations [7]. Similarly, whole genome
sequences have recently been generated from diverse
human populations, and studies of genetic diversity at
the population level have unveiled some interesting
findings [8]. These data look to be dramatically
extended with releases of data from the 1000 Genomes
project [9]. The 1000 Genomes project aims to achieve
a nearly complete catalog of common human genetic
variants (minor allele frequencies > 1%) by generating
high-quality sequence data for > 85% of the genome
for 10 sets of 100 individuals, chosen to represent
broad geographic regions from across the globe. Representation of Europe will come from European American samples from Utah and Italian, Spanish, British
and Finnish samples.
In a recent paper entitled ‘Genes mirror geography
within Europe’ [10], the authors suggest that a geographical map of Europe naturally arises as a two-dimensional summary of genetic variation within Europe and
state that when mapping disease phenotypes spurious
associations can arise if genetic structure is not properly accounted for. In this regard Ireland represents an
interesting case due to its position, both geographically
and genetically, at the western periphery of Europe. Its
population has also made disproportionate ancestral
contributions to other regions, particularly North
America and Australia. Ireland also displays a maximal
or near maximal frequency of alleles that cause or predispose to a number of important diseases, including
cystic fibrosis, hemochromatosis and phenylketonuria
[11]. This unique genetic heritage has long been of
interest to biomedical researchers and this, in conjunction with the absence of an Irish representative in the
1000 Genomes project, prompted the current study to
generate a whole genome sequence from an Irish individual. The resulting sequence should contain rare
structural and sequence variants potentially specific to
the Irish population or underlying the missing heritability of chronic diseases not accounted for by the
common susceptibility markers discovered to date [12].
In conjunction with the small but increasing number
of other complete human genome sequences, we
hoped to address a number of other broader questions,
such as identifying key targets of recent positive selection in the human lineage.

Results and discussion
Data generated

The genomic DNA used in this study was obtained from
a healthy, anonymous male of self-reported Irish Caucasian ethnicity of at least three generations, who has been
genotyped and included in previous association and
population structure studies [13-15]. These studies have
shown this individual to be a suitable genetic representative of the Irish population (Additional file 1).
Four single-end and five paired-end DNA libraries
were generated and sequenced using a GAII Illumina
Genome Analyzer. The read lengths of the single-end
libraries were 36, 42, 45 and 100 bp and those of the
paired end were 36, 40, 76, and 80 bp, with the span
sizes of the paired-end libraries ranging from 300 to 550
bp (± 35 bp). In total, 32.9 gigabases of sequence were
generated (Table 1). Ninety-one percent of the reads
mapped to a unique position in the reference genome
(build 36.1) and in total 99.3% of the bases in the reference genome were covered by at least one read, resulting in an average 10.6-fold coverage of the genome.
SNP discovery and novel disease-associated variants
SNP discovery

Comparison with the reference genome identified
3,125,825 SNPs in the Irish individual, of which 87%
were found to match variants in dbSNP130 (2,486,906
as validated and 240,791 as non-validated; Figure 1).
The proportion of observed homozygotes and heterozygotes was 42.1% and 57.9%, respectively, matching that
observed in previous studies [16]. Of those SNPs identified in coding regions of genes, 9,781 were synonymous,
10,201 were non-synonymous and 107 were nonsense.
Of the remainder, 24,238 were located in untranslated
regions, 1,083,616 were intronic and the remaining
1,979,180 were intergenic (Table 2). In order to validate
our SNP calling approach (see Materials and methods)
we compared genotype calls from the sequencing data
to those obtained using a 550 k Illumina bead array. Of
those SNPs successfully genotyped on the array, 98%
were in agreement with those derived from the sequencing data with a false positive rate estimated at 0.9%,
validating the quality and reproducibility of the SNPs
called.
Disease-associated variants

Various disease-associated SNPs were detected in the
sequence, but they are likely to be of restricted widespread value in themselves. However, a large proportion
of SNPs in the Human Gene Mutation Database
(HGMD) [17], genome-wide association studies
(GWAS) [18] and the Online Mendelian Inheritance in
Man (OMIM) database [19] are risk markers, not
directly causative of the associated disease but rather in
linkage disequilibrium (LD) with generally unknown

SNPs that are. Therefore, in order to interrogate our
newly identified SNPs for potential causative risk factors,
we looked for those that appeared to be in LD with
already known disease-associated (rather than diseasecausing) variants. We identified 23,176 novel SNPs in

Effective depth

close proximity (< 250 kb) to a known HGMD or genome-wide association study disease-associated SNP and
where both were flanked by at least one pair of HapMap
[20] CEU markers known to be in high LD. As the
annotation of the precise risk allele and strand of SNPs
in these databases is often incomplete, we focused on
those positions, heterozygous in our individual, that are
associated with a disease or syndrome. Of the 7,682 of
these novel SNPs that were in putative LD of a HGMD
or genome-wide association study disease-associated
SNP heterozygous in our individual, 31 were non-synonymous, 14 were at splice sites (1 annotated as essential)
and 1 led to the creation of a stop codon (Table S1 in
Additional file 2).
This nonsense SNP is located in the macrophage-stimulating immune gene MST1, 280 bp 5′ of a nonsynonymous coding variant marker (rs3197999) that has
been shown in several cohorts to be strongly associated
with inflammatory bowel disease and primary sclerosing
cholangitis [21-23]. Our individual was heterozygous at
both positions (confirmed via resequencing; Additional
files 3 and 4) and over 30 pairs of HapMap markers in
high LD flank the two SNPs. The role of MST1 in the
immune system makes it a strong candidate for being
the gene in this region conferring inflammatory bowel
disease risk, and it had previously been proposed that
rs3197999 could itself be causative due to its potential
impact on the interaction between the MST1 protein
product and its receptor [22].
Importantly, the newly identified SNP 5′ of rs3197999′
s position in the gene implies that the entire region 3′

of this novel SNP would be lost from the protein,
including the amino acid affected by rs3197999 (Figure
2). Therefore, although further investigation is required,
there remains a possibility that this previously unidentified nonsense SNP is either conferring disease risk to
inflammatory bowel disease marked by rs3197999, or if
rs3197999 itself confers disease as previously hypothesized [22], this novel SNP is conferring novel risk via
the truncation of the key region of the MST1 protein.
Using the SIFT program [24], we investigated whether
those novel non-synonymous SNPs in putative LD with
risk markers were enriched with SNPs predicted to be
deleterious (that is, that affect fitness), and we indeed
found an enrichment of deleterious SNPs as one would

expect if an elevated number were conferring risk to the
relevant disease. Of all 7,993 non-synonymous allele
changes identified in our individual for which SIFT predictions could be successfully made, 26% were predicted
to be deleterious. However, of those novel variants in
putative LD with a disease SNP heterozygous in our
individual, 56% (14 out of 25) were predicted to be
harmful by SIFT (chi-square P = 6.8 × 10-4, novel nonsynonymous SNPs in putative LD with risk allele versus
all non-synonymous SNPs identified). This suggests that
this subset of previously unidentified non-synonymous
SNPs in putative LD with disease markers is indeed substantially enriched for alleles with deleterious
consequences.

Indels

Indels are useful in mapping population structure, and
measurement of their frequency will help determine
which indels will ultimately represent markers of predominately Irish ancestry. We identified 195,798 short
indels ranging in size from 29-bp deletions to 20-bp
insertions (see Materials and methods). Of these, 49.3%
were already present in dbSNP130. Indels in coding
regions will often have more dramatic impacts on protein translation than SNPs, and accordingly be selected
against, and unsurprisingly only a small proportion of
the total number of short indels identified were found
to map to coding sequence regions. Of the 190 novel
coding sequence indels identified (Table S2 Additional
file 2), only 2 were at positions in putative LD with a
heterozygous disease-associated SNP, of which neither
led to a frameshift (one caused an amino acid deletion
and one an amino acid insertion; Table S1 in Additional
file 2).
Population genetics

The DNA sample from which the genome sequence was
derived has previously been used in an analysis of the
genetic structure of 2,099 individuals from various
Northern European countries and was shown to be
representative of the Irish samples. The sample was also
demonstrated to be genetically distinct from the core
group of individuals genotyped from neighboring Britain, and the data are likely, therefore, to complement
the upcoming 1000 Genomes data derived from British
heritage samples (including CEU; Additional file 1).
Non-parametric population structure analysis [25] was
carried out to determine the positioning of our Irish
individual relative to other sequenced genomes and the
CEU HapMap dataset. As can be seen in Figure 3, as
expected, the African and Asian individuals form clear
subpopulations in this analysis. The European samples
form three further subpopulations in this analysis, with
the Irish individual falling between Watson and Venter
and the CEU subgroup (of which individual NA07022
has been sequenced [26]). Therefore, the Irish genome
inhabits a hitherto unsampled region in European
whole-genome variation, providing a valuable resource
for future phylogenetic and population genetic studies.
Y chromosome haplotype analysis highlighted that our
individual belonged to the common Irish and British
S145+ subgroup (JFW, unpublished data) of the most
common European group R1b [27]. Indeed, S145
reaches its maximum global frequency in Ireland, where
it accounts for > 60% of all chromosomes (JFW, unpublished data). None of the five markers defining known
subgroups of R1b-S145 could be found in our individual, indicating he potentially belongs to an as yet
undefined branch of the S145 group. A subset of the

(> 2,141) newly discovered Y chromosome markers
found in this individual is therefore likely to be useful in
further defining European and Irish Y chromosome
lineages.
Mapping of reads to the mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA) associated with UCSC reference build 36
revealed 48 differences, which by comparison to the
revised Cambridge Reference Sequence [28] and the
PhyloTree website [29] revealed the subject to belong to
mtDNA haplogroup J2a1a (coding region transitions
including nucleotide positions 7789, 13722, 14133). The
rather high number of differences is explained by the
fact that the reference sequence belongs to the African
haplogroup L3e2b1a (for example, differences at nucleotide positions 2483, 9377, 14905). Haplogroup J2a (formerly known as J1a) is only found at a frequency of
approximately 0.3% in Ireland [30] but is ten times
more common in Central Europe [31].
The distribution of this group has in the past been
correlated with the spread of the Linearbandkeramik
farming culture in the Neolithic [31], and maximum
likelihood estimates of the age of J2a1 using complete
mtDNA sequences give a point estimate of 7,700 years
ago [32]; in good agreement with this thesis, sampled
ancient mtDNA sequences from Neolithic sites in Central Europe predominantly belong to the N1a group
[33].
SNP imputation

The Irish population is of interest to biomedical
researchers because of its isolated geography, ancestral
impact on further populations and the high prevalence
of a number of diseases, including cystic fibrosis, hemochromatosis and phenyketonuria [11]. Consequently,

Tong et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R91
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/9/R91

several disease genetic association studies have been carried out on Irish populations. As SNPs are often coinherited in the form of haplotypes, such studies generally only involve genotyping subsets of known SNPs.
Patterns of known co-inheritance, derived most commonly from the HapMap datasets, are then often used
to infer the alleles at positions not directly typed using
programs such as IMPUTE [34] or Beagle [35]. In the
absence of any current or planned Irish-specific HapMap population, disease association studies have relied
on the overall genetic proximity of the CEU dataset
derived from European Americans living in Utah for use
in such analyses. However, both this study (Figure 3)
and previous work (Additional file 1) indicate that the
Irish population is, at least to a certain extent, genetically distinct from the individuals that comprise the
CEU dataset.
We were consequently interested in assessing the
accuracy of genome-wide imputation of SNP genotypes
using the previously unavailable resource of genomewide SNP calls from our representative Irish individual.
Using a combination of IMPUTE and the individual’s
genotype data derived from the SNP array we were able
to estimate genotypes at 430,535 SNPs with an IMPUTE
threshold greater than 0.9 (not themselves typed on the
array). Within the imputed SNPs a subset of 429,617
genotypes were covered by at least one read in our analysis, and of those, 97.6% were found to match those
called from the sequencing data alone.
This successful application of imputation of unknown
genotypes in our Irish individual prompted us to test
whether haplotype information could also be used to
improve SNP calling in whole genome data with low
sequence coverage. Coverage in sequencing studies is
not consistent, and regions of low coverage can be adjacent to those regions of relatively high read depth. As
SNPs are often co-inherited, it is possible that high confidence SNP calls from well sequenced regions could be
combined with previously known haplotype information
to improve the calling of less well sequenced variants
nearby. Consequently, we tested whether the use of previously known haplotype information could be used to
improve SNP calling. At a given position where more
than one genotype is possible given the sequencing data,
we reasoned more weight should be given to those genotypes matching those we would expect given the surrounding SNPs and the previously known haplotype
structure of the region. To test this, we assessed the
improvements in SNP calling using a Bayesian approach
to combining haplotype and sequence read information
(see Materials and methods). Other studies have also
used Bayesian methods to include external information
to improve calls in low-coverage sequencing studies
with perhaps the most widely used being SOAPsnp [36].

Page 6 of 14

SOAPsnp uses allele frequencies obtained from dbSNP
as prior probabilites for genotype calling. Our methods
goes further, and by using known haplotype structures
we can use information from SNPs called with relatively
high confidence to improve the SNP calling of nearby
positions. By comparing genotype calls to those
observed on our SNP array we found substantial
improvements can be observed at lower read depths
when haplotype information is accounted for (Figure 4).
At a depth of 2.4X, approximately 95% of genotypes
matched those from the bead array when haplotype
information was included, corresponding to the accuracy
observed at a read depth of 8X when sequence data
alone are used. Likewise, our method showed substantial
improvements in genotype calling compared to only
using previously known genotype frequency information
as priors.
Given the comprehensive haplotype information likely
to emerge from other re-sequencing projects and the
1000 Genomes project, our data suggest that sequencing
at relatively low levels should provide relatively accurate
genotyping data [37]. Decreased costs associated with
lower coverage will allow greater numbers of genomes
to be sequenced, which should be especially relevant to
whole genome case-control studies searching for new
disease markers.
Causes of selection in the human lineage

There have been numerous recent studies, using a variety of techniques and datasets, examining the causes
and effects of positive selection in the human genome
[38-42]. Most of these have focused on gene function as
a major contributing factor, but it is likely that other
factors influence rates of selection in the recent human
lineage. The availability of a number of completely
sequenced human genomes now offers an opportunity
to investigate factors contributing to positive selection
in unprecedented detail.
Using this and other available completely sequenced
human genomes, we first looked for regions of the
human genome that have undergone recent selective
sweeps by calculating Tajima’s D in 10-kb sliding windows across the genome. Positive values of D indicate
balancing selection while negative values indicate positive selection (see Materials and methods for more
details). Due to the relatively small numbers of individuals from each geographical area (three Africans, three
Asians and five of European descent - including reference) [16,26,43-48], we restricted the analysis to regions
observed to be outliers in the general global human
population.
A previous, lower resolution analysis using 1.2 million
SNPs from 24 individuals and an average window size
of 500-kb had previously identified 21 regions showing

evidence of having undergone recent selective sweeps in
the human lineage [41]. Our data also showed evidence
of selection in close proximity to the majority of these
regions (Table 3).
Gene pathways associated with selection in the human
lineage

Examination of genes under strong positive selection
using the GOrilla program [49] identified nucleic acid
binding and chromosome organization as the Gene
Ontology (GO) terms with the strongest enrichment
among this gene set (uncorrected P = 2.31 × 10-9 and
4.45 × 10-8, respectively).
Genes with the highest Tajima’s D values, and predicted to be under balancing selection, were most
enriched with the GO term associated with the sensory
perception of chemical stimuli (uncorrected P = 2.39 ×
10 -21 ). These data confirm a previous association of
olfactory receptors with balancing selection in humans
using HapMap data [50]. However, our analysis also
identified that a range of taste receptors were among
the top genes ranked by D value, suggesting that balancing selection may be associated with a wider spectrum
of human sensory receptors than previously appreciated.
The next most significantly enriched GO term, not
attributable to the enrichment in taste and olfactory
receptors, was keratinization (uncorrected P = 3.23 ×
10-5 ) and genes affecting hair growth have previously

been hypothesized to be under balancing selection in
the recent human lineage [51].
Gene duplication and positive selection in the human
genome

Although most studies examine gene pathways when
investigating what underlies positive selection in the
human genome, it is likely other factors, including gene
duplication, also play a role. It is now accepted that following gene duplication the newly arisen paralogs are
subjected to an altered selective regime where one or
both of the resulting paralogs is free to evolve [52]. Largely due to the lack of available data, there has been little investigation of the evolution of paralogs specifically
within the human lineage. A recent paper has suggested
that positive selection has been pervasive during vertebrate evolution and that the rates of positive selection
after gene duplication in vertebrates may not in fact be
different to those observed in single copy genes [53].
The emergence of a number of fully sequenced genomes, such as the one presented in this report, allowed
us to investigate the rates of evolution of duplicated
genes arising at various time points through the human
ancestral timeline.
As shown in Figure 5, there is clear evidence in our
analysis for high levels of positive selection in recent
paralogs, with paralogs arising from more recent duplication events displaying substantially lower values of

Regions in this analysis with a Tajima’s D value of less than -2 within 100 kb of the corresponding region from Williamson et al. [41] are highlighted in bold.
(Selection of 21 random positions in the genome 1,000 times never produced as many within close proximity to a window whose Tajima’s D was less than -2.)

Tajima’s D than the background set of all genes. Indeed,
elevated levels of positive selection over background
rates are observed in paralogs that arose as long ago as
the eutherian ancestors of humans (Figure 5). Consequently, while in agreement with the previous observation of no general elevation in the rates of evolution in
paralogs arising from the most ancient, vertebrate duplication events, these data clearly illustrate that more
recently duplicated genes are under high levels of positive selection.
As discussed, it has been proposed that, upon gene
duplication, one of the gene copies retains the original
function and is consequently under stronger purifying
selection than the other. However, it has also been proposed that both genes may be under less sequence
restraint, at least in lower eukaryotes such as yeast [52].
We consequently examined the rates of positive selection in both copies of genes in each paralog pair to see
whether both, or just one, in general show elevated rates
of positive selection in the human lineage. More closely
examining paralog pairs that arose from a duplication
event in Homo sapiens highlighted that even when only
those genes in each paralog pair whose value of D was
greater were examined, their D values were still significantly lower than the genome average (t-test P < 2.2 ×
10-16), illustrating that even those genes in each paralog

pair showing the least evidence of positive selection still
show substantially higher levels of positive selection
than the majority of genes. These results therefore support the hypothesis that both paralogs, rather than just
one, undergo less selective restraint following gene
duplication. Consequently, a significant driver for many
of the genes undergoing positive selection in the human
lineage (Table S3 in Additional file 2) appears to be this
high rate of evolution following a duplication event. For
example, 25% of those genes with a Tajima’s D value of
less than -2 have been involved in a duplication event in
Homo sapiens, compared to only 1.63% of genes with D
values greater than this threshold (chi-squared P < 2.2 ×
10-16), illustrating that there is a substantial enrichment
of genes having undergone a recent duplication event
among the genes showing the strongest levels of positive
selection. In conclusion, it appears that whether a gene
has undergone a recent duplication event is likely to be
at least as important a predictor of its likelihood of
being under positive selection as its function.

Conclusions
The first Irish human genome sequence provides insight
into the population structure of this branch of the European lineage, which has a distinct ancestry from other
published genomes. At 11-fold genome coverage,

Figure 5 Tajima’s D values for paralogs arisen from gene duplications of different ages. Mean Tajima’s D values for genes involved in
duplication events of differing ages. Horizontal dotted line indicates median Tajima’s D value of all genes in human genome. As can be seen,
genes involved in a recent duplication event in general show lower values of D than the genome-wide average, with genes involved in a
duplication event specific to Humans, as a group, showing the lowest values of D. (Kruskal-Wallis P < 2.2 × 10-16).

approximately 99.3% of the reference genome was covered and more than 3 million SNPs were detected, of
which 13% were novel and may include specific markers
of Irish ancestry. We provide a novel technique for SNP
calling in human genome sequence using haplotype data
and validate the imputation of Irish haplotypes using
data from the current Human Genome Diversity Panel
(HGDP-CEPH). Our analysis has implications for future
re-sequencing studies and suggests that relatively low
levels of genome coverage, such as that being used by
the 1000 Genomes project, should provide relatively
accurate genotyping data. Using novel variants identified
within the study, which are in LD with already known
disease-associated SNPs, we illustrate how these novel
variants may point towards potential causative risk factors for important diseases. Comparisons with other
sequenced human genomes allowed us to address positive selection in the human lineage and to examine the
relative contributions of gene function and gene duplication events. Our findings point towards the possible primacy of recent duplication events over gene function as

indicative of a gene’s likelihood of being under positive
selection. Overall, we demonstrate the utility of generating targeted whole-genome sequence data in helping to
address general questions of human biology as well as
providing data to answer more lineage-restricted
questions.

Materials and methods
Individual sequenced

It has been recently shown that population genetic analyses using dense genomic SNP coverage can be used to
infer an individual’s ancestral country of origin with reasonable accuracy [15]. The sample sequenced here was
chosen from among a cohort of 211 healthy Irish control subjects included in recent genome-wide association
studies [13,14] with all participants being of selfreported Irish Caucasian ethnicity for at least three generations. Using Illumina Infinium II 550 K SNP chips,
the Irish samples were assayed for 561,466 SNPs
selected from the HapMap project. Quality control and
genotyping procedures have been detailed previously

Tong et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R91
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/9/R91

[15]. We have previously published 300 K density
STRUCTURE [54,55] and principle components analyses
of the Irish cohort both in comparison to similar
cohorts from the UK, Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden
and Finland [15], and in separate analyses in comparison
to additional cohorts from the UK, Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium, France, Poland and Germany [14]. The
data demonstrate a broad east-west cline of genetic
structure across Northern Europe, with a lesser northsouth component [15]. Individuals from the same populations cluster together in these joint analyses. Using
these data, we here selected a ‘typical’ Irish sample,
which clustered among the Irish individuals and was
independent of the British samples, for further
characterization.
Genomic library preparation and sequencing

All genomic DNA libraries were generated according to
the protocol Genomic DNA Sample Prep Guide - Oligo
Only Kit (1003492 A) with the exception of the chosen
fragmentation method. Genomic DNA was fragmented
in a Biorupter™ (Diagenode, Liége, Belgium). Paired-end
adapters and amplification primers were purchased from
Illumina (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA catalogue number PE-102-1003). New England Biolabs (New England
Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) was the preferred supplier
for all enzymes and buffers and Invitrogen (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) for the dATP. Briefly, the workflow
for library generation was as follows: fragmentation of
genomic DNA; end repair to create blunt ended fragments; addition of 3′-A overhang for efficient adapter
ligation; ligation of the paired-end adapters; size selection of adapter ligated material on a 2.5% high resolution agarose (Bioline HighRes Grade Agarose - Bioline,
London, UK), catalogue number BIO-41029); a limited
12 cycle amplification of size-selected libraries; and
library quality control and quantification. For each
library 5 μg of DNA was diluted to 300 μl and fragmented via sonication - 30 cycles on Biorupter High setting
with a cycle of 30 s ON and 30 s OFF. All other manipulations were as detailed in the Illumina protocol.
Quantification prior to clustering was carried out with
a Qubit™ Fluorometer (Invitrogen Q32857) and QuantiT™ dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Invitrogen Q32851). Libraries
were sequenced on Illumina GAII and latterly GAIIx
Analyzer following the manufacturer’s standard clustering and sequencing protocols - for extended runs multiple sequencing kits were pooled.
Read mapping

NCBI build 36.1 of the human genome was downloaded
from the UCSC genome website and the bwa alignment
software [56] was used to align both the single- and
paired-end reads to this reference sequence. Two

Page 10 of 14

mismatches to the reference genome were allowed for
each read. Unmapped reads from one single-end library
were trimmed and remapped due to relative poor quality at the end of some reads, but none were trimmed
shorter than 30 bp.
SNP and indel identification

SNPs were called using samtools [57] and glfProgs [58]
programs. The criteria used for autosomal SNP calling
were: 1, a prior heterozygosity (theta) of 0.001; 2, positions of read depths lower than 4 or higher than 100
were excluded; 3, a Phred-like consensus quality cutoff
of no higher than 100.
Only uniquely mapped reads were used when calling
SNPs. SNPs in the pseudoautosomal regions of the X
and Y chromosomes were not called in this study and
consequently only homozygous SNPs were called on
these chromosomes. The criteria used for sex chromosome SNP calling were: 1, positions of read depths
lower than 2 or higher than 100 were excluded; 2, the
likelihoods of each of the four possible genotypes at
each position were calculated and where any genotype
likelihood exceeded 0.5 that did not match the reference
a SNP was called.
The positive predictive value in our study, assessed
using the 550 k array data as in other studies [48], was
99%. As a result of maintaining a low false positive rate,
the heterozygote undercall rate observed in this analysis
was slightly higher than in other studies of similar depth
- 26% as opposed to 24% and 22% in the Watson and
Venter genomes, respectively.
SNP consequences were determined using the
Ensembl Perl APIs and novel SNPs identified through
comparisons with dbSNP130 obtained from the NCBI
ftp site. Further human genome SNP sets were also
downloaded
from
their
respective
sources
[7,16,26,43-48]. The CEU dataset for the SNP imputation and population structure analysis were downloaded
from the Impute and HapMap websites, respectively.
Previously identified disease variants were downloaded
from OMIM (15 April 2009) and HGMD (HGMD Professional version 2009.4 (12 November 2009)). Pairs of
HapMap SNPs in high LD flanking novel markers and
known disease variants were identified using the
Ensembl Perl APIs.
Indels were called using samtools [57]. Short indels
had to be separated by at least 20 bp (if within 20 bp,
the indel with the higher quality was kept) and for the
autosomes had to have a mapping quality of greater
than 20 and be covered by a read depth of greater than
4 and less than 100. For the sex chromosomes the lower
threshold was set at 2. As with SNP calling, only
uniquely mapped reads were used. Twenty-six randomly
selected coding indels were confirmed via resequencing

Tong et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R91
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/9/R91

of which 24 displayed traces supporting the indel call.
Of the remaining two, one showed a double trace
throughout suggestive of unspecific sequencing, while
the second showed no evidence of the indel (Table S4
in Additional file 2).
SNPs and indels were analyzed with SIFT tools at the
J Craig Venter Institute website [59]. Indel positions
were remapped to build 37 of the reference genome
using the liftover utility at UCSC as a number of coding
indels identified in build 36 were found not to affect
corresponding genes when the latest gene builds were
used. The identification of the enrichment of allele
changes deemed by SIFT to be deleterious among novel
SNPs in putative LD with disease markers was determined using both high and low confidence SIFT predictions of deleterious variants. However, when only the
proportion of non-synonymous SNPs called deleterious
with high confidence across the whole genome (744 out
of 7,993; 9.3%) was compared to the number observed
in the subset of SNPs in putative LD with disease markers (6 out of 25; 26.1%), a significant difference was
still observed (P = 0.025, Fisher’s exact test).
Y chromosome analysis

All called Y chromosome nucleotide differences from
the Human Reference sequence were catalogued.
Although originating from multiple individuals, the
majority of the Y chromosome reference sequence
represents a consensus European R1b individual, either
because all individuals in the pool belonged to this
group, or because they outnumbered the others in the
original sequencing. While most of the differences from
the reference were novel, they included S145, which
reaches frequencies of about 80% in Ireland. There are
at present five known non-private subgroups of R1bS145 (M222, S168, S169, S175 and S176, all seen in Ireland); none of these SNPs were identified in the Irish
individual and he potentially belongs to an as yet undescribed sublineage within S145.
Imputation

IMPUTE [34] version 1 was used in all imputation analyses and phased haplotype information for the 1000
Genomes project and HapMap3 release 2 were obtained
from the IMPUTE website [60]. The accuracy of imputation in the Irish population was assessed using the genotypes from the Illumina bead array and the HapMap 3
haplotypes [20]. Only genotypes at SNPs not on the bead
array with an IMPUTE score above 0.9 were compared
to the most probable genotype from the sequencing data
obtained with glfProgs. Where more than one genotype
was equally likely, one was chosen at random.
In an attempt to improve SNP calling, haplotype
information was combined with sequencing data via a

Page 11 of 14

Bayesian approach. At any given position in the genome,
1 of 16 genotypes must be present (AA, AT, AC, AG,
TT, TC and so on) and glfProgs provides the likelihood
ratio for each of these possible genotypes at each position given the observed sequence data. The likelihood
ratio is defined as the likelihood ratio of the most likely
genotype to the genotype in question and consequently
the likelihood ratio of the most likely genotype will be
1. As there are only 16 possible genotypes, it is possible
to obtain the likelihood for each genotype at each position by dividing the genotype’s likelihood ratio by the
sum of all 16 likelihood ratios at that position, giving
our conditionals.
To calculate our genotype priors at any given position
in the genome, we took the probabilities of the genotypes at surrounding positions in the genome (obtained
from the sequencing data alone using glfProgs as
described above) and used these as input to the
IMPUTE program to predict the probabilities of each
genotype at the position of interest, giving our priors.
Posteriors were then calculated using the standard Bayes
formula.
To assess the effectiveness of imputation-based priors
at various coverage depths, mapped reads were randomly removed and the above process repeated (the
resulting genotype calls for chromosome 20 are provided in Additional file 5).
Selection

Tajima’s D values for each 10-kb window of the human
genome were calculated using the variscan software
[61], with a 5-kb overlap between adjacent windows.
Tajima’s D compares two estimates of the population
genetics parameter θ; namely, the average number of
differences seen between each pair of sequences (θ w )
and the observed number of segregating sites (θS) [62].
When a population evolves neutrally these two values
are expected to be approximately equal. If, however, a
region is under positive selection, mutations at this location would be expected to segregate at lower frequencies, leading to a lower observed average number of
differences between each pair of sequences (θw). On the
other hand, under balancing selection this average number of differences will be expected to be larger. By comparing θ w to θ S it is possible to determine regions of
selection, the principle underlying Tajima’s D. Where
positive selection is occurring θw will be small and Tajima’s D will be negative, while balancing selection will
lead to larger values of θw and positive values of D. In
this analysis ten re-sequenced genomes were used; the
Irish sample described here, three further Caucasians
(NA07022, Watson and Venter), one Chinese, two Koreans, and three Africans (only the Bantu genome from
[16] was included as, unlike the Khoisan genome, SNP

Tong et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R91
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/9/R91

calls without the exome sequencing data were available,
more closely corresponding to the datasets of the other
genomes used) [16,26,43-48]. Consequently, along with
the haploid reference genome, a total of 21 chromosomes were used in this analysis. As in previous studies
[63] we used a cutoff of -2 to indicate putative regions
of positive selection and +2 to indicate putative regions
of balancing selection. In total 9,152 (1.6%) of the
573,533 overlapping windows in the genome had a D
value of less than -2 in our analysis, corresponding to
4,819 distinct regions (having concatenated overlapping
windows).
The coordinates of Williamson et al.’s [41] regions of
high positive selection were converted to build 36 positions through the use of the liftover utility at UCSC.
The analysis of Williamson et al. had shown that
regions close to centromeres often display high levels of
recent selection and the regions identified in our study
as showing the strongest evidence of having undergone
recent selective sweeps were also overwhelmingly
located at chromosomal centromeres (data not shown).
Consequently, despite our relatively small number of
individuals, our high number of SNPs gave us the power
to detect previously identified regions of selection even
when a small window size was used, allowing us to pick
up regions with a finer resolution than has been possible
in previous analyses.
Average Tajima’s D values were calculated for each
Ensembl 54 protein coding gene by averaging the corresponding values for all windows that it overlapped.
Ranked GO enrichment analysis was carried out using
the GOrilla application [49]. The list of paralogs used in
this analysis, and their associated age, were obtained
from Vilella et al. [64]. Paralogs in close proximity
(< 250 kb) were ignored.
Population structure

The AWclust R package [25] was used for the non-parametric population structure analysis. Only unrelated
members of the CEU HapMap dataset were retained in
the analysis, all trio offspring being excluded. We used
405,737 autosomal SNPs from the Illumina 550 k set for
which genotypes were present for all individuals in this
analysis. Information from the sequence of NA07022
was not included due to his presence in the HapMap
dataset.
Data accessibility
