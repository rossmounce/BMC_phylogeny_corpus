Abstract
Background: We studied four extremely halophilic archaea by low-pass shotgun sequencing: (1) the
metabolically versatile Haloarcula marismortui; (2) the non-pigmented Natrialba asiatica; (3) the psychrophile
Halorubrum lacusprofundi and (4) the Dead Sea isolate Halobaculum gomorrense. Approximately one
thousand single pass genomic sequences per genome were obtained. The data were analyzed by
comparative genomic analyses using the completed Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 genome as a reference. Lowpass shotgun sequencing is a simple, inexpensive, and rapid approach that can readily be performed on any
cultured microbe.
Results: As expected, the four archaeal halophiles analyzed exhibit both bacterial and eukaryotic
characteristics as well as uniquely archaeal traits. All five halophiles exhibit greater than sixty percent GC
content and low isoelectric points (pI) for their predicted proteins. Multiple insertion sequence (IS)
elements, often involved in genome rearrangements, were identified in H. lacusprofundi and H. marismortui.
The core biological functions that govern cellular and genetic mechanisms of H. sp. NRC-1 appear to be
conserved in these four other halophiles. Multiple TATA box binding protein (TBP) and transcription
factor IIB (TFB) homologs were identified from most of the four shotgunned halophiles. The reconstructed
molecular tree of all five halophiles shows a large divergence between these species, but with the closest
relationship being between H. sp. NRC-1 and H. lacusprofundi.
Conclusion: Despite the diverse habitats of these species, all five halophiles share (1) high GC content
and (2) low protein isoelectric points, which are characteristics associated with environmental exposure
to UV radiation and hypersalinity, respectively. Identification of multiple IS elements in the genome of H.
lacusprofundi and H. marismortui suggest that genome structure and dynamic genome reorganization might
be similar to that previously observed in the IS-element rich genome of H. sp. NRC-1. Identification of
multiple TBP and TFB homologs in these four halophiles are consistent with the hypothesis that different
types of complex transcriptional regulation may occur through multiple TBP-TFB combinations in
response to rapidly changing environmental conditions. Low-pass shotgun sequence analyses of genomes
permit extensive and diverse analyses, and should be generally useful for comparative microbial genomics.

Background
Extremely halophilic archaea inhabit hypersaline environments containing three to five molar salts. These environments are widely distributed, and include solar saltern
facilities, the Dead Sea coast, and brine inclusions. The
environments are diverse with respect to salinity, pH, temperature, pressure, light, and oxygen. This wide range of
conditions contributes to the diversity of halophile
barophilic, alkaliphilic, and psychrophilic characteristics
in addition to their obligate halophilicity. Extreme halophiles are classified as members of the Halobacteriaceae
family and further organized into nineteen genera [1].
Halophiles are a relatively poorly studied branch of the
archaea with only one complete genome sequence, that of
Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 [2].
The genome of NRC-1 consists of a large chromosome of
2,014,239 bp and two additional minichromosomal replicons of 365,425 bp (pNRC200) and 191,346 bp
(pNRC100). The two minichromosomes are relatively less
GC rich than the largest chromosome (57.9% and 59.2%
vs. 67.9%). Averaged across all three chromosomes, H. sp.
NRC-1 has an overall 65.8% GC content. Identification of
ninety-one insertion sequence (IS) elements representing
twelve different IS families is consistent with the dynamic
genome rearrangements observed, mediated by the multiple IS elements [3]. Genome sequence analysis identified
2,682 putative protein-coding genes. Among these, counting each identical multigene family as one gene, 2,413
genes are unique. Analysis of the genome sequence and
the predicted proteome reveals that H. sp. NRC-1 is more
similar to other archaeal species than to non-archaeals. H.
sp. NRC-1 possesses similarities to bacteria in genes coding for aerobic respiration and in overall genomic structure, and to eukaryotes in genes coding for DNA
replication, transcription, and translation [2,4], H. sp.
NRC-1 predicted proteins are extremely acidic; protein
acidity is associated with enhanced solubility and activity
in hypersaline cytoplasm [4].
Nineteen genera of extreme halophiles have been
reported: Haloarcula, Halobacterium, Halobaculum, Halococcus, Haloferax, Halogeometricum, Halorhabdus, Halorubrum, Halosimplex, Haloterrigena, Natrialba, Natrinema,
Natronobacterium, Natronococcu, Natronomonas, Natronorubrum, Haloalcalophilium, Halobiforma, and Halomicrobium.
Most halophilic species possess distinctive phenotypic
features such as gas vesicles, purple membranes, or redorange carotenoids. Many have the ability to grow phototropically in the absence of oxygen, using light energy
transduced by bacteriorhodopsin (BR), halorhodopsin
(HR), and ATP synthetase.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/3

Lake, Antarctica, is psychrophilic (cold loving) and grows
at temperatures as low as four degrees Celsius [5]. Some
halobacterial species are alkaliphilic. Some are acid-tolerant. Natronobacterium pharaonis from Wadi Natrun, Egypt
and Natronococcus occultus from Lake Magadi, Africa have
pH optima ranging from 9.5 to 10 and do not grow below
pH 8.5. Slight acidophiles, such as Haloferax volcanii and
Haloferax mediterranei, grow at pH values as low as 4.5.
Unlike other Halobacterium species, Natrialba asiatica and
Natrialba magadii are not pigmented; they contain less
than 0.1% of bacterioruberins, which give most halophiles their red-orange color [6].
Membership in a large and diverse family, adaptation to
unique environments, ease of culture, and the availability
of genetic tools make the halophiles one of the best model
systems to study microbial diversity and adaptation. To
advance this model system, we previously determined the
first complete halobacterial genome sequence, that of H.
sp. NRC-1 [2], In this present study, we analyzed the halophile family more broadly through a comparative
genomic approach based on low-pass sequencing. We
scanned the genome sequences of four additional species:
(1) Haloarcula marismortui, a metabolically versatile halophile [7], (2) Natrialba asiatica, a non-pigmented alkaliphile [8], (3) Halorubrum lacusprofundi, a psychrophile
[5], and (4) Halobaculum gomorrense, an isolate from a
depth of 4 meters in the Dead Sea [9]. These organisms
were studied by random shotgun sequence analysis. This
analysis consisted of generating approximately one thousand genomic sequence reads, which provided partial
genomic scans and permitted comparative genomic analyses with the completely sequenced H. sp. NRC-1 genome
as a reference.
Low pass genomic sequencing is twenty-fold less expensive than complete genome sequencing, yet provides data
for useful comparative genomic analyses. It was a natural
choice for the study of the intriguing Halobacteriaceae family.

Results
Validation of low-pass sequencing
The genome of H. sp. NRC-1 is very compact (approximately 87% coding region) and the sequences of most
random genomic fragments contain genes [2], To evaluate
the utility of low-pass sequencing for the comparative
analysis of Halobacteriaceae genomes, we hypothesized: 1)
the partial genome sequences generated by shotgun
sequencing were sufficient to identify the genes contained
in most fragments and 2) a large number of different
unique genes would be identified from ~1,000 sequence
reads.

Some recently isolated species exhibit additional interesting features. Halorubrum lacusprofundi, isolated from Deep

In order to test our hypotheses, 1,085 sequences of 450 bp
average length were extracted from the actual H. sp. NRC1 genome [10], with each sequence having a uniform
probability of starting at any base of any of the three chromosomes, which is a reasonable approximation of the
sonication process by which fragments are generated for
shotgun sequencing. These 1,085 sequences represent
approximately 0.2-fold coverage of the genome. The
sequences were then used to search the protein nonredundant (nr) database on the NCBI server http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST with BLAST, using default
parameters. Using expert curation of the graphically visualized alignments, a total of 1,094 genes were identified
from the 1,057 sequences. Some reads spanned more than
one gene. Twenty-eight of the 1,085 sequence reads did
not have database gene matches; they were from the intergenic regions of the H. sp. NRC-1 genome. Several of the
genes were overlapped by more than one random
sequence; of the 1,094 genes identified, 820 were unique.
The validation study supports our hypothesis that many
genes can be successfully identified using partial genome
sequences, and also validates the gene identification
methods which were further applied to analyze database
search results with the actual partial genome sequence
reads of the four halophiles, described in the next section.
The non-redundant database contained H. sp. NRC-1 proteins at the time this search was done. Therefore, we ran
the risk of overestimating the number of genes that we
might identify in the four halophiles to be shotgunned.
However, excluding H. sp. NRC-1 proteins would create
an underestimate, as there were few other sequences from
Halobacteriaceae in Genbank. For example, only 329
TREMBL genes are identified with BLASTX using the
BLOSUM80 matrix in our initial 1,085 random sequences
when all Halobacteriaceae sequences are excluded (in this
case, counting no more than one gene per sequence, and
approximating by equating a gene with any hit with an evalue less than or equal to 0.01). We assayed variability of
this statistic by repeating it on an independently generated set of another 1,085 random sequences; 304 TREMBL
genes were identified. Including the Halobacteriaceae
TREMBL proteins, 881 and 892 genes were identified
respectively, with 95% of the additional identifications
due to alignments with H. sp. NRC-1 proteins. For our
experimental planning purposes, we felt that retaining the
H. sp. NRC-1 proteins would result in less error than
excluding them. The resulting approximation was sufficient for us to proceed with actual sequencing. However,
our results would not necessarily be precisely predictive of
gene prediction power in other organisms. Such predictive
power would depend on the number of closely related
sequences in Genbank.

Overview of sequencing
Sequencing was conducted with the M13 forward primer
on shotgun libraries prepared using sonicated genomic
DNA from each of the four halophiles. The traces were
processed with PHREDPHRAP http://www.phrap.org.
This procedure produced 1,097 high-quality sequences
for H. marismortui, 1,085 for H. lacusprofundi, 1,104 for N.
asiatica, and 1,170 for H. gomorrense. The initial 1,085 random H. sp. NRC-1 sequences described above in the validation study were used in conjunction with the newly
sequenced halophile sequences in most of the subsequent
analyses described here. The number of high-quality bases
per read ranged from 40 to 750 for all genomes. The average lengths of the high-quality sequences were
524,441,469, and 415 bases, respectively (Figure 1).
These represent approximately 15%, 18%, 17%, and 18%
coverage of each genome, respectively.
Gene prediction
The DNA sequences generated by the shotgun method are
usually not long enough to contain complete genes
including start and stop codons. For this study, "best
match" open reading frames were determined as
described in Methods. When multiple sequence reads
with different reading frames matched to the same gene,
the match results of the sequence reads were compared by
the percent identity, length of the alignments, and p value.
The best match was then selected and the reading frame of
the sequence was considered the "best match" ORF representing that gene.

Of the 1,097 H. marismortui sequences, 810 sequences
(74%) had matches to the nr protein database. Of these,
703 were unique. H. gomorrense had a total of 1,170
sequences, of which 1,006 sequences (86%) had matches
to the nr protein database. Of these, 742 were unique. Of
the 1,085 H. lacusprofundi sequences, 802 sequences
(74%) matched to the nr protein database. Of these, 623
were unique. Of the 1,104 N. asiatica sequences, 862
(78%) were matched to the nr protein database. Of these,
678 were unique. The length range of partial ORFs was 30
to 256 residues with average lengths of 121,130,137, and
130 aa, respectively (Figure 2). The non-archaeal best
matches were distributed between bacterial and eukaryotic sequences. Thus, like H. sp. NRC-1 and other archaea,
these four halophiles have both bacterial and eukaryotic
features [11,12].
Sequences with no database matches were not further
analyzed. It is possible these sequences are new/unique
genes to each halophile and therefore no match would be
found in databases. Alternatively, these sequences may be
non-coding, intergenic sequences. About 36% of predicted ORFs in H. sp. NRC-1 genome did not have any significant match to the nr protein database.

processing the shotgun sequences with PHREDPHRAP.

Of the 1,085 randomly selected H. sp. NRC-1 sequences,
1,057 (97.4%) had matches to the nr protein database,
while 28 (2.6%) had no matches to the database. Further
analysis revealed that all of the 28 sequences were from
intergenic regions, consistent with no significant matches
with the nr protein database. The 1,057 sequences with
database matches identified 820 unique proteins.
Insertion sequence elements
IS elements are repetitive sequences that can broker
genome reorganization and mediate evolution by creating
insertion mutations, recombinations, and gene conversions. In Halobacterium these elements have expanded to
multiple families and subfamilies with multiple copy
numbers [13]. Of the ninety-one IS elements representing
twelve families in the H. sp. NRC-1 genome, sixty-nine
were found in the minichromosomes including twentynine IS elements on pNRC100 and forty on pNRC200. In
the H. sp. NRC-1, due to genetic instability caused by
transposition of insertion sequences, typically about 1%
of colonies in a plate are gas-vesicle deficient and 0.1% are
carotenoid deficient mutants [13].

In order to determine whether the presence of multiple IS
elements is a general property of halophiles, sequences of
each halophile were searched for IS elements. H. sp. NRC-1
IS elements were searched against each halophile sequence
to identify homologous IS elements. Halophile sequences
were also searched against the nr protein database to identify any new IS elements. In the H. lacusprofundi genome,
we identified 38 sequences homologous to six different IS
families of NRC-1. Ten H. marismortui genome sequences
that were homologous to six different IS families of H. sp.
NRC-1 were also identified, while only one sequence each
from H. gomorrense and N. asiatica was found. These
matched to ISH4 and ISH9 of NRC-1, respectively (Table
1). All IS elements identified were homologous to one of
the H. sp. NRC-1 IS elements, and no new IS elements were
identified. In this analysis using partial genome sequences,
multiple sequence reads often matched to a single IS family. This may represent multiple copies of the repeat or multiple sequence reads of the same repeat. Considering that
the sequences were all generated from a random shotgun
library and sequenced to relatively low redundancy, it is
unlikely that several sequences would be derived from the
same location. The results indicate that the H. lacusprofundi
genome contains the highest number of IS elements.

GC composition
Previous studies of several Halobacterium and Halococcus
species found that their genomes contain both relatively
GC-rich (66–68%) components and relatively GC-poor

(57–60%) components [14]. The genome analysis of H.
sp. NRC-1 revealed that the plasmids pNRC100 and
pNRC200 contain lower GC content than the main chromosome (57.9% and 59.2% vs. 67.9%). To evaluate

GC distribution for five partially sequenced genomes
GC distribution for five partially sequenced genomes. GC distribution of Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 (unmarked line), Halobaculum gomorrense (asterisks), Halorubrum lacusprofundi (filled triangles), Haloarcula marismortui (squares), and Natrialba asiatica
(filled squares) are indicated. Average GC contents for H. sp. NRC-1, H. gomorrense, H. lacusprofundi, H. marismortui, and N. asiatica were 66%, 65.1%, 61.4%, 60%, and 61.2%, respectively.

whether the presence of DNA components varying in their
GC content is a general genome property of the halophiles, sequence reads from each of the halophiles were
analyzed for their GC composition (Figure 3). GC analysis
of random NRC-1 sequences shows two small peaks at
about 56% and 59%, which likely reflect the DNA component of pNRC100 and pNRC200, and a large peak at
about 70%, likely reflecting the DNA component of the
chromosome. In H. sp. NRC-1, of the sequence reads in
the peak of 56% GC content, 62% were from pNRC100;
of the sequence reads in the peak of 59% GC content,
73% were from pNRC200. Similarly, lower GC peaks and
higher GC peaks were observed from H. lacusprofundi, H.
gomorrense, and H. marismortui. H. lacusprofundi showed
lower GC peaks at about 56%–58% and a higher GC peak
at about 65–68%. H. gomorrense had lower GC peaks at
about 60%–62% and a higher GC peak at about 68%. H.
marismortui showed lower GC peaks at about 51%–54%
and a higher GC peak at about 62%. N. asiatica showed
peaks at about 62–66%.
In the case of H. sp. NRC-1, the presence of three chromosomes (two of them mini) of differing GC contents is
known. The presence of such plasmids in the four shotgunned halophiles has not been determined yet, as they
are not, if present, resolvable with routine pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis. It is not clear if the observed two or three
peaks of differing GC contents in the shotgunned halophiles are due to the presence of plasmids, or to regions of
varying GC contents within one replicon.
The genome analysis of H. sp. NRC-1 revealed an overall
GC composition of 65.9%. The environments where halo-

philes are found are often areas exposed to extreme levels
of UV solar radiation. Active DNA repair mechanisms for
damage caused by UV irradiation, such as the formation
of thymine dimers, have been previously observed in
halophiles [4]. The four newly sequenced halophiles have
60% or higher overall GC content. The GC content of
Halobacteriaceae thus may have evolved to minimize DNA
damage caused by solar UV irradiation.
Isoelectric point of predicted proteins
Halophiles maintain osmotic balance between their cytoplasms and the hypersaline environment by maintaining
ionic distributions of intracellular potassium of about
four molar, equal to the external sodium concentration
[2,15]. One of the most interesting properties of halophiles is the ability of their proteins to function in such a
hypersaline cytoplasm, where mesophilic proteins would
become denatured. Early findings showed that the surfaces of halophilic proteins are highly acidic, with negatively charged amino acid residues [16]. This was shown
to enable proteins to stay soluble and active through the
binding of hydrated salt ions in the solution [16-18].
Accordingly, recent investigations of predicted proteins
from H. sp. NRC-1 demonstrate extremely acidic proteins
with an overall median isoelectric point (pI) of 4.9 and a
strong peak (mode) around 4.2 [4].

For our novel shotgunned sequences, the "best match"
ORFs were used to estimate pI of their corresponding proteins. This approach was first validated using partial ORFs
of 820 proteins from random H. sp. NRC-1 sequences. The
predicted median pI of 4.4, calculated from partial ORFs,
was somewhat lower to the median pI of 4.9 calculated

Calculated isoelectric point (pI) versus number of predicted proteins. Predicted isoelectric points from four halophiles and random H. sp. NRC-1 proteins were plotted [H. gomorrense (Hg), H. lacusprofundi (Hl), H. marismortui (Hm), N. asiatica (Na), and
random H. sp. NRC-1 (rNRC-1)]. All halophiles show the highest peak at pI between ~4.1 and ~4.3 with median pI range from
4.3 to 4.4.

from the complete set of H. sp. NRC-1 proteins. However,
both results had a distinct peak (mode) at pI 4.2.
Therefore, we estimated pI from 703 H. marismortui, 623
H. lacusprofundi, 678 N. asiatica, and 742 H. gomorrense
partial ORFs. All halophiles, including H. sp. NRC-1 recomputed from our random set of sequences, had their
major pI peak between 4.1 and 4.3. The median pIs of H.
marismortui, H. lacusprofundi, N. asiatica, H. gomorrense,
and randomly recalculated H. sp. NRC-1 were 4.4, 4.4,
4.3, 4.3, and 4.4, respectively (Figure 4).
The prevalence of highly acidic proteins across the four
newly sequenced halophiles is consistent with those halophiles employing the acidic protein stabilizing mechanisms for hypersaline environments. Highly acidic
proteins are thus a general feature of extreme halophiles,
providing the basis for enhanced solubility in the presence of high salts.
Conserved core biological functions
Of the unique genes identified through their "best match"
ORFs in the newly sequenced halophiles, 56% or more
were homologous to H. sp. NRC-1 genes. This finding suggests conservation of genes and their functions between
H. sp. NRC-1 and each halophile. In order to identify conserved core biological functions between H. sp. NRC-1

and the newly sequenced halophiles, genes homologous
to H. sp. NRC-1 were classified into twelve functional
groups: amino acid metabolism, cell envelope components, cellular processes, cofactor metabolism, DNA replication repair and recombination, energy metabolism,
nucleotide metabolism, regulation, transcription, translation, transport, and miscellaneous genes. These are the
same classifications described for the H. sp. NRC-1
genome project [2]. Also, an identical comparison to a
subset of only 820 random H. sp. NRC-1 genes was made
to enable quantitative comparison of these results with
those of the other interspecies results. Core biological
functions that are essential for H. sp. NRC-1 to function
also seem to be conserved in the four halophiles (Figure
5). Presence of genes for the citric acid cycle for uptake
and utilization of amino acids, sodium-proton antiporters, potassium uptake systems, DNA replication, transcription, and translation systems resembling eukaryotes
were observed in all species. Some of the aminoacyl-tRNA
synthetases that were not found in some archaea (e.g.
Methanococcus jannaschii [19]) but present in H. sp. NRC1 were identified in H. marismortui, H. gomorrense, and N.
asiatica. Identification of multiple proteins involved in
DNA repair pathways suggests that halophiles utilize multiple pathways to repair DNA damage.

Distribution of core biological functions conserved in Halobacterium sp
Figure 5
Distribution of core biological functions conserved in Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 and four other halophiles. Core biological functions shared between H. sp. NRC-1 and each halophile were classified into twelve classes and the number of genes in each category is plotted. Most of the functions are conserved with respect to H. sp. NRC-1. Mechanisms common to halophiles, such
as active ion transporter system to maintain osmotic balances in and outside of the cells and DNA repair mechanism in
response to possible UV – irradiation, seem well preserved.

Interestingly, bacteriorhodopsin (BR) and halorhodopsin
(HR), the light driven ion transporters for protons and
chloride, were identified in H. marismortui. This finding
suggests the presence of a similar photoactive proton and
chloride pumps for phototrophic growth in H. marismortui [20,21]. The kinase 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate (KdgK),
an enzyme catabolizing 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate to 2keto-3-deoxygluconate-6P in the glucose metabolism
pathway was identified in H. marismortui. This finding
suggests the presence of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway,
observed in some halophiles including H. sp. NRC-1
[2,22,23]. The presence of similar pathways controlling
flagellar rotation was also observed among all halophiles
in this study. Identification of multiple cell-signalling
transducer protein homologs in most of the newly
sequenced halophiles suggests dynamic cellular functions
in response to rapidly changing environmental
conditions.

Conservation of gene order between halophiles
Gene clusters encoding proteins of related functions are
often co-localized in prokaryotic genomes; this
organization could assist assigning functions to unknown
ORFs when gene clusters of two organisms are compared
[24]. The prediction of functional linkage between the
genes involved in several metabolic pathways across the
multiple genomes has been demonstrated to correlate
functional with physical linkages of gene clusters [25].
Co-localization of functionally related genes was also
identified in the H. sp. NRC-1 genome. The H. sp. NRC-1
analysis revealed that nine of the ten genes involved in
arginine metabolism cluster at three genomic loci. Coinduction of the argS with the arcABC gene cluster on
repressing phototrophy has been recently discussed [26].
Co-localization of the gene clusters involved in isoprenoid biosynthesis, purple membrane biogenesis, and
nucleotide metabolism are also observed at multiple loci
across the H. sp. NRC-1 genome.

We found many instances of two or more consecutive
genes in H. sp. NRC-1 that may be similarly linked in the
four newly sequenced halophiles (Table 2). Detection of
the conserved gene orders among the genes associated
with important biological functions such as amino acid
metabolism, cofactor metabolism, energy metabolism,
translation, and transport suggests selective pressure to
maintain such gene arrangements.
Transcription factor family
Archaea possess a simplified version of the eukaryotic
RNA polymerase II-like transcription system including
highly conserved TBP and TFB proteins, but no eukaryallike TBP-associated factors (TAFs) [27,28]. Recently, multiple TBP and TFB proteins have been reported in several
archaea including H. sp. NRC-1 [12] and another halophilic archaea isolated from the Dead Sea, Haloferax volcanii [29]. A novel mechanism of transcriptional regulation
by forty-two different combinations of multiple TBP and
TFB interactions has been recently suggested for NRC-1
[30].

In our database searches, we identified several TFB
homologs including TfbF and TfbC homologs from H.
gomorrense, TfbF and TfbG homologs from H.
lacusprofundi, and a TfbF homolog from N. asiatica. Pairwise amino acid identity of these newly identified TFBs to
H. sp. NRC-1 TFBs demonstrated a high conservation of
more than 83% except for the TfbC (64%) homolog from
H. gomorrense. Sequence alignments between the newly
identified TFBs and the seven H. sp. NRC-1 TFB proteins
revealed conserved functional domains with eukaryal
TFIIB proteins (Figure 6).
Among the newly identified TFB proteins, one H. gomorrense protein (TfbC) had sequence spanning the aminoterminal sequences. However, the possession of a likely
zinc finger domain with conserved patterns of
(CXXC)X15–17(CXXC) found in H. sp. NRC-1 [30] was not
observed. A helix-turn-helix motif, the TFIIB recognition
element (BRE) binding domain, was identified in every
new TFB protein with a sequenced carboxy-terminus [31].

Sequence alignments for TFB proteins
Sequence alignments for TFB proteins. Sequences for seven Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 TFBs and five predicted TFBs from H.
lacusprofundi (Hl), H. gomorrense (Hg), and N. asiatica (Na) were aligned. Amino acids conserved in at least six of the twelve
sequences are shaded (the amino acid involved in interaction with TBP are shaded in black). The boxed region indicates likely
Zn-finger domains [(CXXC)X{15–17}(CXXC)]. Helix-turn-helix DNA binding motifs are underlined.

involved in TBP interaction [30], were conserved in the
newly identified TFB proteins.

In order to study TFB family evolution, orthology relationships between the newly identified TFBs and H. sp.
NRC-1 TFBs were analyzed by constructing a molecular
tree from protein sequence distances. Of the five newly

Figure 7
Unrooted molecular tree of TFB protein family
Unrooted molecular tree of TFB protein family. Newly identified TfbF proteins from H. lacusprofundi (Hl), N. asiatica (Na), and
H. gomorrense (Hg) and TfbG from H. lacusprofundi show orthology with TfbF and TfbG of H. sp. NRC-1. Orthology was supported by the high bootstrap scores (numbers on the branch) generated by 1000 replicates. The results suggest similar structural and functional characteristics between TFB proteins among the halophiles.

identified TFBs, TfbC of H. gomorrense and TfbA and TfbE
of H. sp. NRC-1 were excluded from the molecular tree
generation because these sequences had high sequence
divergence from all other members. The resulting molecular tree lends support to orthologous relationships
among the newly identified TFBs and those of H. sp. NRC1, suggesting similar structural and functional characteristics between these TFB proteins (Figure 7).
Our findings of multiple TFB homologs in H. lacusprofundi and H. gomorrense suggest the presence of multiple
transcription factors in other halophiles as well. In order
to evaluate such a possibility, enzyme-digested genomic
DNA of five halophiles, including H. sp. NRC-1, were subjected to Southern hybridization to estimate the number
of related or identical sequences to tfb genes. By counting
only highly distinguishable bands in the Southern blot
(data not shown), at least four tfb-related sequences were
identified in all newly sequenced halophiles but N.
asiatica (three). H. sp. NRC-1 genomic DNA, used as a pos-

itive control, hybridized to seven bands, presumably corresponding to the seven known tfbs.
In our low-pass sequence analysis, the presence of a TBP
homolog was not observed in the newly sequenced halophiles. Using Southern hybridization, we estimated the
numbers of sequences related to tbp genes. The results suggest the possible presence of two tbp related sequences
from H. gomorrense and H. lacusprofundi and one tbprelated sequence from H. marismortui and N. asiatica.
These four halophiles contain fewer copies of tbp genes
than H. sp. NRC-1, which showed six tbp-related
sequences in Southern analysis, corresponding to the six
known tbps.
Identification of the presence of multiple transcription
factor genes suggests transcriptional regulation through a
variety of TBP-TFB combinations in the four newly
sequenced halophiles.

Global similarity estimation to NRC-1
The four newly sequenced halophiles, as well as the previously sequenced H. sp. NRC-1, belong to the Halobacteriaceae family. More recent isolates H. marismortui and H.
gomorrense are from the Dead Sea, H. lacusprofundi from
Antarctica, and N. asiatica from Japan [6]. Sequence similarity is expected between closely related species. However, adaptation to their unique environments may have
contributed to sequence divergence in these organisms.
Similarity between organisms may be estimated among
orthologous genes of all analyzed species, but this limits
analysis to only a small number of genes, which may not
be representative of global similarity.

In order to estimate sequence divergence of our four shotgunned species from H. sp. NRC-1, overall sequence similarity was determined from the BLAST DNA and protein
sequence alignment identities to H. sp. NRC-1. The species with the highest average sequence similarity to H. sp.
NRC-1 was H. lacusprofundi, with 62% identity in DNA
and 46% in protein sequences. H. gomorrense had 62%
and 45%, H. marismortui had 60% and 43%, and N. asiatica had 60% and 43% identity to DNA and protein
sequences of H. sp. NRC-1, respectively. The sequence
divergence may be due to different selective pressures in
the unique environments of each species.

(A) and the 16S rRNA (B) analysis. Molecular trees reconstructed by two different methods are compared and show
agreement each other. The methodology using protein distances of whole genome sequences could successfully estimate the evolutionary relationship among the four complete
genomes. The bootstrap score (1000) is shown for the 16S
rRNA analysis.

Estimation of evolutionary distance between five
halophiles
16S rRNA is useful for studying evolution because it is
ubiquitous in all prokaryotes and contains highly
conserved as well as variable regions, which can be used
for determination of divergences at different taxonomic
levels. For instance, the highly conserved region can be
used to compare distantly related organisms whereas the
variable region can be used to look at the divergence
between closely related species. Although analysis based
on 16S rRNA is useful, it does not yield unambiguous
conclusions. Phylogenetic analysis of individual genes
(such as 16S rRNA) is based upon only a small portion of
an entire genome. Since a massive amount of sequence
data (including the whole genome sequences) is now
available, alternative methods of phylogenetic analysis
that make use of these data are possible.

One method developed in this study for phylogeny reconstruction utilizes the protein distances calculated between
the species. The method was first tested on completed
genomes including Escherichia coli K-12 Strain MG1655,
Haemophilus influenzae Rd KW20, Mycoplasma genitalium
G-37, and Bacillus subtilis 168. E. coli and H. influenzae
belong to the same bacterial phylum, gamma proteobacteria, while M. genitalium and B. subtilis belong together in
the low-GC gram-positive phylum. These genomes were
selected to determine if the newly developed method is
able to identify distance between closely related species
(in the same phylum), and also to test its ability to discriminate between different phyla. These two phyla are
closely related based on 16S rRNA phylogeny. Unrooted
molecular trees were computed; the tree computed by our
novel protein distance matrix was compared to the tree
computed from 16S rRNA (Figure 8). The reconstructed
molecular trees are in good agreement. Our simple
methodology thus demonstrates an alternative way of calculating protein distances using more sequence data, and
validates the current proposed relationship of four
genomes.
Knowing that evolutionary relationships can be closely
estimated using protein distance matrix methods, we then
employed the method to calculate distances between the
halophiles. The molecular tree obtained was compared to
the 16S rRNA tree (Figure 9). Our analysis indicates H. sp.
NRC-1 is more closely related to H. lacusprofundi, but the
16S rRNA analysis shows N. asiatica is more closely
related to H. sp. NRC-1. It is not clear which molecular
tree more likely represents the true evolutionary relationships among these 5 halophiles. However, closer relationship between H. sp. NRC-1 and H. lacusprofundi were
supported by the identification of the highest number of
IS elements and genes that are homologs to H. sp. NRC-1
in H. lacusprofundi.

Molecular trees of five halophiles
Molecular trees of five halophiles. Molecular tree was reconstructed by the protein distance matrix (A) and the 16S rRNA (B)
analysis. The comparison between molecular trees obtained by two different methods showed lack of congruence among halophiles. Both trees resemble a "star" phylogeny among the five species, suggesting significant molecular divergence between species. The bootstrap scores are shown on 16S rRNA analysis.

Discussion
Orthology and divergence between the genomes of NRC-1
and other halophiles
We have studied four extremely halophilic archaea by
low-pass genome sequencing and compared the results to
a reference genome (H. sp. NRC-1) to better understand
their orthologous characteristics. Despite the geographic
remoteness of the habitats from which each of these species was isolated, and the evolutionary pressure to adapt
to their unique environments, some unique core characteristics of extremely halophilic archaea seem conserved
among the five species. Strikingly, the four newly
sequenced halophiles also exhibit low pI of their proteins.
The result suggests the presence of acidic proteins is an
essential mechanism to function in hypersaline environments and that these four halophiles also maintain high
salt concentration in their cytoplasm to maintain ionic
balance in hypersaline environments.

Approximately 60% or higher overall GC content was
observed in the halophile species analyzed in our study.
This observation suggests that halophiles evolved to
maintain such GC content as a survival mechanism in
order to counteract DNA damage, mostly in the form of
thymine dimers, caused by solar UV irradiation. Together

with the observed low pI of the proteins, this finding suggests that additional characteristics are shared among the
five halophiles, corresponding to life in UV irradiation
and high salinity. Furthermore, analysis of putative genes
homologous to H. sp. NRC-1 genes indicates that core
biological functions governing cellular and genetic mechanisms of halophiles are well conserved between H. sp.
NRC-1 and the four halophiles.
The newly identified TFBs included in the molecular tree
analysis had pairwise amino acid identity of more than
83% with those in H. sp. NRC-1. The molecular tree of the
newly identified TFBs and H. sp. NRC-1 TFBs suggests an
orthologous relationship of the TfbG protein of H. lacusprofundi with H. sp. NRC-1. TfbF proteins identified from
H. lacusprofundi, H. gomorrense, and N. asiatica also show
orthologous relationships with TfbF of H. sp. NRC-1.
These relationships were supported by high bootstrap
values. Identification of multiple TFB proteins in all newly
sequences halophiles suggests transcriptional regulation
through a variety of TBP-TFB combinations, as previously
suggested [30]. Different TBP-TFB combinations are likely
to serve in response to different cellular and environmental stimuli.

Analysis of IS elements showed that more sequence reads
for H. lacusprofundi (38 reads) had similarity to NRC-1 IS
elements, followed by H. marismortui (10 reads). Considering that the sequences are generated from a random
shotgun library and that similar coverage of each genome
sequence was used for analysis, these results suggest that
the H. lacusprofundi genome contains the highest number
of IS sequences homologous to H. sp. NRC-1. This conservation may be due to these transposon elements entering
the two genomes by multiple transposition processes, or
simply due to a more recent divergence from a common
ancestor.
The overall DNA sequence identity of the four halophiles
to H. sp. NRC-1 was 60–62%. Similarly, an average of
39% of putative genes identified from the four halophiles
were not homologous to H. sp. NRC-1 genes. The
sequence divergence may conceivably be due to different
selective pressures in the environment of each species. The
four newly sequenced halophiles also exhibit homology
to both bacteria and eukaryotes, consistent with similar
observations in H. sp. NRC-1 and other archaea.
Molecular tree reconstruction
The evolutionary relationships of the five halophiles were
assessed by two methods: a protein distance matrix and a
16S rRNA analysis. The protein distance matrix method
we have developed for phylogeny reconstruction utilizes
all available sequence information and calculates protein
distances from the results of alignments of protein
sequences between species. The method is very simple, as
it relies on mean or median similarity of the entire complement of predicted proteins, but appears to offer sufficient resolution to provide useful insight across relevant
evolutionary time frames. The molecular trees obtained
by the protein distance matrix and the 16S rRNA lacked
congruence. The protein distance matrix analysis indicates
that H. sp. NRC-1 is more closely related to H. lacusprofundi, while the 16S rRNA analysis suggests that N. asiatica
is more closely related to H. sp. NRC-1. Although 16S
rRNA is the commonly used sequence to study evolutionary divergence, some discrepancies between the rRNA
trees and gene trees in the investigation of individual
genes and proteins have been previously discussed
[32,33]. In contrast, the result of the protein distance
matrix is supported by our findings of DNA and protein
sequence similarity analysis, which indicated the highest
sequence similarity between H. lacusprofundi and NRC-1.
This finding was further supported by the presence of the
highest number of IS elements that are homologous to IS
elements found in H. sp. NRC-1. In addition, 63 % of
putative genes identified from H. lacusprofundi sequences
were homologous to NRC-1 genes, the highest percent
among the four halophiles in this study. Although the
observed "star" phylogeny suggests significant molecular

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/3

divergence between species, considered together, our findings suggest the closest of the relationships is between
NRC-1 and H. lacusprofundi.
Utility of low-pass sequencing for comparative genomics
Our analysis of low-pass sequencing demonstrated possible ways of identifying coding regions from sequence
reads and allowed comparison between related species.
Low-pass sequencing becomes more useful when a closely
related reference genome is available. Some of our findings include: 1) identification of 60% or higher GC content and low protein pI among five halophiles, 2)
identification of IS elements in all halophiles, 3) detection
of gene conservation among halophiles, including
approximately 60% genes shared with H. sp. NRC-1, spanning many core biological functions; 4) identification of
genes belonging TFB families, and 5) detection of conserved gene orders between H. sp. NRC-1 and other
halophiles.

Low-pass sequencing, however, exhibited limited utility
for some genome analyses. Partial ORFs of predicted proteins limit detailed analysis on such proteins. Large-scale
genomic topology cannot be inferred from low-pass
sequencing. The evidence of common genetic exchange
within a species and among closely and distantly related
microbes by lateral gene transfer is hard to elucidate. A
complete list of genes in a gene family or elements
involved in a pathway could not be obtained. The basis of
additional extremophilic characters, such as psychrophily,
alkaliphily, barophily, and acidophily are difficult to
determine. Low-pass sequencing has limited ability to
resolve multigene families, pseudogenes, and allelic
variations. These last are seldom issues in microbial genetics, but could be problematic in diploid organisms.
Nevertheless, to obtain a general comparative view on
genomes of related species, low-pass sequencing can be an
effective way of providing information in a time- and
effort-efficient manner [34].

Conclusions
Low-pass sequencing is useful for comparative genomics,
and will be increasingly so as sequencing technologies
improve. It could be both cost- and time-effective for comparative genomics. Low-pass sequence data enables
diverse analyses, especially identifying orthologous characteristics between a reference genome, such as that of H.
sp. NRC-1 and related species. Comparative analyses show
shared mechanisms governing cellular and genetic functions among these five halophiles. High GC contents, low
pI of predicted proteins, multiple IS elements, biological
pathways, and multiple transcription factors are conserved among the species despite geographic diversity of
habitats.

Methods
Strains
The halophiles used in the study for sequencing were
obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC,
http://www.atcc.org). Haloarcula marismortui (ATCC#:
43049), Halobaculum gomorrense (ATCC#: 700876), Halorubrum lacusprofundi (ATCC#: 49239), and Natrialba asiatica (ATCC#: 700177) were cultured in ATCC media
1218, 2169, 1682, and 805, respectively, prepared according to the directions from ATCC. The estimated genome
sizes of the halophiles by pulse field gel electrophoresis
were: H. marismortui, ~3,900 kb; H. lacusprofundi, ~2,600
kb; N. asiatica, ~3,100 kb; and H. gomorrense, ~2,700 kb
(data not shown).
Preparation of templates for DNA sequencing
White colonies from a blue/white screened shotgun
library were picked and transferred to 96-well PCR plates
containing 5 µl deionized water. Cells were resuspended
thoroughly by multiple pipetting and a 45 µl of PCR mixture containing 1X buffer, 0.25 mM dNTP, 1.5 mM MgCl2,
8% DMSO, 0.2 µM each forward and reverse primer and
1.25 unit of Taq polymerase was added into each well.
Taq polymerase, 10X buffer (without MgCl2) and MgCl2
were purchased from Promega (Promega Corporation,
Madison, WI). Primers used in the study were modified
M13 forward and reverse primers (Forward primer: 5'-TTT
CCC AGT CAC GAC GTT GTA-3'. Reverse primer: 5'-GTG
AGC GGA TAA CAA TTT CAC3'). PCR was carried out by
denaturing at 92°C for 10 seconds, annealing at 58°C for
45 seconds, and extension at 72°C for 3 minutes for a
total of 35 cycles. PCR products with clear bands were further selected and then purified using MutiScreen-FB,
Opaque plates (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA)
according to the manufacturer's direction. Purified PCR
products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis to
assess DNA quality. The average size of DNA was ~2.5 kb.
Automated DNA sequencing and sequence processing
Sequencing was carried out using ABI PRISM® BigDye™
Terminator cycle-sequencing ready-reaction kits, Version
2.0 and 3.0 (PE Corporation, Foster City, CA). The cycle
sequencing reaction was performed in 96-well plates
according to the procedures provided by the manufacturer
using 3.3 pmol of M13 forward primer, up to 1 µg template DNA, and 4 µl BigDye™ Terminator in a total of 10
µl reaction volume. Thermal cycling was set for
denaturing at 96°C for 10 seconds, annealing at 50°C for
5 seconds, and extension at 60°C for 2 minutes for a total
of 50 cycles. Sequencing electrophoresis was performed
on the ABI PRISM 3700 automated DNA analyzer (PE
Corporation, Foster City, CA). Using PHREDPHRAP
http://www.phrap.org, DNA chromatograms were analyzed, bases called, and quality values assigned.

Gene prediction
Sequence reads were translated into six reading frames
and compared to the nr protein database at NCBI http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov using the BLASTX program, with
default parameters. The best match of each search result
with a minimum 30 amino acid alignment, protein identity match ≥ 30%, and BLAST P value ≤ 10-5 was considered to possibly represent a protein encoding gene. In
prokaryotes, there is a high prior probability of the presence of a gene on a sequence read, so a 30 amino acid
alignment yields few false positive gene/ORF assignments; this might not be the case in vertebrates, for example. Our criteria were selected based on validation test
results from the random H. sp. NRC-1 sequences searched
against the nr protein database at NCBI. Using these criteria, sequences encoding the genes and sequences derived
from intergenic regions resulting in no match to the nr
protein database were identified, using manual curation
to eliminate obviously spurious results (e.g., those resulting from low-complexity alignments).

If more than one "best match" ORF mapped to the same
homolog, then only the longest match was retained as a
representative of that homolog. Most of the "best match"
ORFs lacked a start codon, stop codon, or both. One
sequence read could contain two "best match" ORFs, with
the ends of the sequence matching to two different
proteins.
Identification of Insertion sequence elements
A database containing IS element sequences found in the
H. sp. NRC-1 genome was created. All H. sp. NRC-1 IS
sequences were searched against each halophile
sequences using BLASTN http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
blast. A minimum 90 bp nucleotide match with ≥ 70%
identity was considered to represent a true match. A search
of the nr-protein database was performed to identify IS
elements present in other species besides H. sp. NRC-1; no
additional IS elements were identified. Sequence reads
identified from the search results as IS elements were then
compared to a list of unknown function H. sp. NRC-1
genes (named "vng" genes [2]) of containing IS elements.
GC composition analysis
To avoid repetitive counting of overlapping nucleotides
common to more than one sequence, PHREDPHRAP
http://www.phrap.org assembled sequences into contigs
based on overlap regions between sequences. After the
assembling process, PHREDPHRAP creates output files
for assembled sequences as contigs, and for the unassembled sequences, as singlets. The global GC composition of
each halophile was analyzed from contigs and singlets
files by calculating the frequency of each nucleotide.

Prediction of isoelectric point of predicted protein
"Best match" ORFs were extracted from each sequence
read by a Perl script. The sequences were converted into
GCG format and submitted to the GCG.® Wisconsin Package™ program PEPTIDESORT http://www.accelrys.com to
obtain isoelectric point values.
Analysis of gene order conservation
In order to detect instances of two or more consecutive
genes in H. sp. NRC-1 that may be similarly linked in the
four newly sequenced halophiles, all sequence reads were
compared to the H. sp. NRC-1 genome as a reference
sequence. Due to the sequence divergence between these
genomes, this comparison requires the most sensitive
alignment algorithm in order to be successful. The
FASTA3 [35] program was used with the "A" parameter to
force the use of unlimited Smith-Waterman [36,37] alignment for the final DNA sequence alignment. Using a Perl
script for automation, one or more pairs (due to multiple
matches to NRC-1) of start and end positions were
defined for each sequence read, rejecting segments with
expectation values above 0.1. The most significant matching sequence read (by calculated expectation value) was
compared to the gene annotation of NRC-1 to determine
which genes, if any, overlap.
Analysis of sequence similarity to NRC-1
The DNA sequence similarity to H. sp. NRC-1 was analyzed by comparing all of the sequence reads against the
H. sp. NRC-1 genomic DNA sequence database using
BLASTN http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST. Protein
sequence similarity to H. sp. NRC-1 was analyzed by comparing all the sequence reads against the H. sp. NRC-1
genomic DNA sequence database using TBLASTX http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST. A Perl script was written
to extract the best match result including E and p value, %
identity, and the query sequence reading frame matched
to the subject. A minimum 90 bp nucleotide match for
DNA, or 30 amino acid match with ≥ 30 % identity for
protein between the query and the subject sequences was
required for inclusion in the analysis. The "percent identity" value from all the search results was used to calculate
average similarity.
Southern hybridization analysis
Enzyme-digested genomic DNA of five halophiles including H. sp. NRC-1 were subject to Southern hybridization
to identify the copy numbers of tbp and tfb genes. Aliquots
of 5 µg of genomic DNA were digested with BamHI, claI,
KpnI, PstI, and SmaI restriction enzymes and fractionated
by agarose gel electrophoresis in 1X TAE buffer (40 mM
Tris-acetate, 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). The genes tfbF and tbpE
found in H. sp. NRC-1 were used for the Southern blot
analysis probe. The tfbF gene was selected as a probe
because our findings show homologous sequences in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/3

most of the halophiles used in this study. The tbpE gene
was selected as a probe because the expression of this protein, but not of the other TBP, had been confirmed in our
proteomics study [38]. The genes were PCR-amplified
from H. sp. NRC-1 genomic DNA and the PCR amplified
genes were excised and purified from the gel by the
Sephaglas™BandPrep Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech
Inc. Piscataway, NJ). The gene sizes for tfbF and tbpE are
950 bp, 550 bp, respectively. DNA labelling, hybridization, and detection were carried out using DIG High
Prime DNA Labelling and Detection Starter Kit II (Roche
Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) according to
the manufacturer's directions.
Molecular tree construction
ClustalX ftp://ftp-igbmc.u-strasbg.fr/pub/ClustalX/ was
used to construct multiple alignments. The range of the
multiple alignments to be included in the analysis was
decided based upon alignment quality. Multiple sequence
alignments were visually inspected, and regions with the
least number of gaps were selected. Different alignment
lengths were tested for each tree construction and found
not to significantly affect the results. Sequences were then
bootstrapped with thousand replicates using the SEQBOOT algorithm implemented in the PHYLIP 3.573c
package
http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/
phylip.html. For DNA sequences, distances and the
molecular tree were computed with the DNAML algorithm with the global rearrangements heuristic option of
PHYLIP. Protein distances were computed with the
PROTDIST algorithm using the Dayhoff matrix, and the
unrooted molecular tree was computed with the FITCH
algorithm.
Multiple Sequence Alignments and Identification of
protein motifs
Conserved sequences of the multiple alignment results
were shaded using the multiple-alignment printing and
shading
program,
BOXSHADE
3.21
http://
www.ch.embnet.org/software/BOX_form.html.
Conserved motifs were identified by searching sequences
against the Pfam database http://pfam.wustl.edu.
Estimation of evolutionary distance by means of protein
distance
Annotated gene sequences of four complete microbial
genomes, E. coli, H. influenzae, M. genitalium, and B. subtilis were retrieved from the TIGR microbial database http:/
/www.tigr.org/tdb/mdb/mdbcomplete.html.
DNA
sequences were then translated into six reading frames.
CROSS_MATCH http://www.phrap.org was used to compare the sets of sequences with other sets of sequences.
Several combinations of command line options, such as
MINMATCH, BANDWIDTH, and MINSCORE, were
tested. The cut-off criteria selected in the study was MIN-

SCORE 250, MINMATCH 15, and BANDWIDTH 1. The
output file of CROSS_MATCH contains the substitution
score which represents the distance between two species
calculated from the differences in a given protein
sequence alignment. The median values of the substitution scores were then calculated and stored as a pairwise
distance matrix.
