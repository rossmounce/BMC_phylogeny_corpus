Abstract
Background: Mitochondrial genomes (mtDNA) of numerous sponges have been sequenced as
part of an ongoing effort to resolve the class-level phylogeny of the Porifera, as well as to place the
various lower metazoan groups on the animal-kingdom tree. Most recently, the partial mtDNA of
two glass sponges, class Hexactinellida, were reported. While previous phylogenetic estimations
based on these data remain uncertain due to insufficient taxon sampling and accelerated rates of
evolution, the mtDNA molecules themselves reveal interesting traits that may be unique to
hexactinellids. Here we determined the first complete mitochondrial genome of a hexactinellid
sponge, Aphrocallistes vastus, and compared it to published poriferan mtDNAs to further describe
characteristics specific to hexactinellid and other sponge mitochondrial genomes.
Results: The A. vastus mtDNA consisted of a 17,427 base pair circular molecule containing thirteen
protein-coding genes, divergent large and small subunit ribosomal RNAs, and a reduced set of 18
tRNAs. The A. vastus mtDNA showed a typical hexactinellid nucleotide composition and shared a
large synteny with the other sequenced glass sponge mtDNAs. It also contained an unidentified
open reading frame and large intergenic space region. Two frameshifts, in the cox3 and nad6 genes,
were not corrected by RNA editing, but rather possessed identical shift sites marked by the
extremely rare tryptophan codon (UGG) followed by the common glycine codon (GGA) in the +1
frame.
Conclusion: Hexactinellid mtDNAs have shown similar trends in gene content, nucleotide
composition, and codon usage, and have retained a large gene syntenty. Analysis of the mtDNA of
A. vastus has provided evidence diagnostic for +1 programmed translational frameshifting, a
phenomenon disparately reported throughout the animal kingdom, but present in the hexactinellid
mtDNAs that have been sequenced to date.

Background
The Phylum Porifera (sponges) is currently divided into
three extant classes – the Hexactinellida, Demospongiae,
and Calcarea – and one fossil class – the Archaeocyatha
[1]. Hexactinellids differ from the canonical sponge body
plan in lacking discrete motile cells (see [1,2] for a
detailed review). The tissue of hexactinellids forms a continuous multinucleate syncytium. Cellular components
exist, but all "cells" are connected by cytoplasmic bridges
to one-another and to the syncytium. Choanocytes are
branched; collar-flagella units ("collar bodies") form as
enucleate buds, several arising from a single nucleated
choanoblast [2-4]. The distinct tissue organization was
considered important enough to warrant separation of
hexactinellids from other Porifera at the subphylum level
– Symplasma for the Hexactinellida and Cellularia for the
Demospongiae and Calcarea [5]. In no other animal is the
tissue so inclusively connected in a giant syncytium, making the hexactinellid body construction unique among
Porifera, as well as all Metazoa.
The Porifera has long been considered the earliest branching group of the metazoan crown, based on both morphological and molecular evidence, although the precise
relationships of the lower metazoan phyla remains uncertain [6-11]. One on-going approach to resolve the overall
metazoan phylogeny, as well as the problematic classlevel relationships among the sponges, has been comparative analysis of mitochondrial genomes (mtDNA). To
date, this effort has seen the sequencing and description
of five complete demosponge mtDNAs [GenBank:
NC_006894, NC_006990, NC_006991, NC_008944,
NC_009090], and most recently, that of two partial hexactinellid sponge mtDNAs [GenBank: EF537576,
EF537577]. Phylogenetic estimations based on concatenated mitochondrial protein sequences have been sensitive to taxon sampling, outgroup choice and algorithm
implementation. These trees reveal artifacts likely due to
variable rates of molecular evolution, such that placozoans, cnidarians, and demosponges are recovered as a
monophyletic clade, with hexactinellids the sister group
of bilaterians [12-16]. The tree topologies may become
more stable, and consistent with plausible hypotheses of
the evolution of morphological traits, as the mtDNA of
additional taxa are added to the data set.
While sequence-based mtDNA comparisons of the lower
metazoa have not been phylogenetically definitive, the
efforts have dispelled some commonly held myths and
revealed some general characteristics of animal mtDNA.
Placozoan mtDNA, for example, is twice as large as most
animal molecules, ranging from 32 to 43 kilobases, and
retains various traits of the non-metazoan outgroups such
as substantial intergenic space, introns and large open
reading frames less commonly found in other animal

mtDNA [12,17]. On the other hand, demosponge mtDNA
is more typical of other animals – compact molecules,
between 18 and 25 kb, with few or no introns, little intergenic space, and coding for twelve to fourteen respiratory
chain
proteins
and

RNAs
[13,15,16,18,19]. Two partial hexactinellid mitochondrial genomes, those of Sympagella nux (Order Lyssacinosida, Family Caulophacidae) and Iphiteon panicea (Order
Hexactinosida, Family Dacylocalycidae), have recently
been reported [14]. These genomes were found to have
similar protein-coding gene content as the published
demosponges, but had several features such as tRNA structure and content more similar to that of bilaterians [14].
The current paper reports on the complete mtDNA
sequence of the hexactinellid sponge Aphrocallistes vastus
(Order Hexactinosida, Family Aphrocallistidae), compares it to previously published poriferan mtDNAs, and
highlights two translational frameshifts, a phenomenon
that is unique to the hexactinellids among reported lower
metazoan mitochondrial genomes.

Results and Discussion
Gene content
The complete mitochondrial genome of Aphrocallistes vastus was sequenced and shown to be a 17,427 base pair circular molecule encoding 13 proteins, 2 ribosomal RNA
subunits, and 18 tRNAs [Genbank: EU000309] (Figure 1,
Table 1). All genes were found to be coded on the same
strand. The protein coding genes included 12 of the respiratory genes (atp6, cob, cox1-3, nad1-4, 4L, 5, 6) common
to most animal mtDNA, as well as the ATP synthase F0
subunit9 (atp9) found in all published sponge mitochondrial genomes except for Amphimedon [13-16,19]. A 411
bp open reading frame (orf411) of unknown identity and
function was located adjacent to the largest, 568 bp, intergenic space (is568), just downstream of the nad4 + trnH +
nad6 + trnG genes (Figures 1 and 2). orf411 does not display significant nucleotide or amino acid similarity to
either of the unknown ORFs in the I. panicea mtDNA.
is568 contains numerous direct repeats and may comprise
a control region that includes the origin of replication. A
putative control region was inferred in the mitochondrial
genome of Amphimedon as well [13].

The beginnings and ends of the small and large rRNA subunits, 918 bp and 1718 bp, respectively, were approximated from alignment data as these genes retained little
sequence similarity to the rRNAs from sequenced demosponge mtDNAs, or with those in the non-redundant
BLAST database. Thus the complete rRNA sequences
remain to be confirmed experimentally. The A. vastus
rRNAs were similar to the predicted rRNAs of I. panicea
and S. nux, and the rnl sequence was highly similar to the
partial 16S rRNA from the hexactinellid Heterochone
calyx [Genbank: AM183122], indicating that these genes

are similar within the hexactinellids but divergent from
those of other sponge classes. Whereas the first three published sponge mtDNAs, all of closely related demosponges, presented a picture of highly similar, conserved
molecules [15,19], additional demosponge and hexactinellid mtDNAs have since revealed that some sponge
mtDNAs have unknown ORFs, genes on the complement
strand (as in Oscarella carmela), and divergent gene
sequences [13,14,16].
The tRNA complement of A. vastus, 18 genes predicted by
tRNAscan-SE and confirmed by BLAST similarity searches
[20,21], was much reduced compared to that of demosponges, and even sparser than the other reported hexactinellids, which had 22 and 20 tRNAs [14]. It included
2 isoacceptors for serine, trnSer(ucu) and trnSer(uga), while
three tRNAs are missing entirely: trnD, trnE, and trnT

(Table 1). A reduction in mitochondrial encoded tRNAs,
therefore, represents a polyphyletic characteristic between
lower metazoan groups, found most extremely among
cnidarians which have lost nearly all of their mtDNA
encoded tRNAs [22]. The structure of the A. vastus trnS1,
predicted by tRNAscan-SE, reveals a DHU arm with a
uniquely truncated D-loop, a feature distinct from the
novel trnS genes in I. panicea and S. nux, which have a
loop in place of a DHU arm, reminiscent of bilaterian
tRNAs (Figure 3). The remaining A. vastus tRNAs display
traits similar to those of the other hexactinellids – namely
polymorphic DHU and TψC arms, and loss of the canonical guanine bases in the DHU loop. Numerous tRNAs
(trnA, trnR, trnQ, trnG, trnI, trnK, trnF, trnP, and trnY) have
mismatches in their acceptor arm, as well as in their anticodon arm (trnS2, trnI, and trnQ) and T-arm (trnR, trnM,
and trnS1) (Additional file 1), a common feature in higher

experienced a higher rate of compaction than other parts
of the mtDNA.

Genome organization, nucleotide composition and codon
usage
The organization of the A. vastus mtDNA was quite compact, typical of sponges and most other animals. Nearly
72% of the mtDNA was predicted to encode proteins
(including orf411), 22% to encode ribosomal and transfer
RNAs, while only 6% was non-coding intergenic space.
Almost 52% of the intergenic space was comprised of the
predicted control region, is568 (Figure 1). Furthermore,
there were eight examples of overlapping genes, including
one remarkable instance in which the trnF gene was found
entirely contained within the nad5 open reading frame
(Table 1). Four of the eight gene overlaps involve the
nad2-nad5 gene block, indicating that this region has

Nucleotide composition of A. vastus was found to be similar to that of the reported hexactinellids in terms of A-T
richness and nucleotide skew, as was its codon usage. The
A. vastus mtDNA was calculated to be 70.7% A+T, nearly
identical to that of S. nux (70.4%). The AT skew (calculated as (A-T)/(A+T)) and GC skew (calculated as (G-C)/
(G+C)) for the coding strand of A. vastus were 0.18 and 0.28, again nearly identical to those of S. nux (0.19 and 0.28). While the skew metrics were quite similar among
the hexactinellids, they ran counter to the compositional
preferences of the demosponges, which display negative
AT and positive GC skews. All three known hexactinellids
share a reassignment of AGR codons from ariginine to serine (see Haen et al., 2007 for a detailed analysis). This

Figure 2
Linearized genomes of all sequenced poriferan mtDNAs
Linearized genomes of all sequenced poriferan mtDNAs. Side-by-side comparison of the mtDNAs of A. vastus and the
previously published hexactinellid sponge mtDNAs reveal a large syntenic gene block: atp6-cox3-nad2-nad5-trnF-trnC-nad1-trn(L,
I, N, Y)-cob. Variable gene arrangements among the hexactinellids include, but are not limited to, the order of cox2-rnl, the
transposition of nad3, and the presence and location of nad6. Demosponges (excepting the homoscleromorph O. carmela)
retain the syntenic block cox2-atp8-atp6-cox3 which is highly conserved throughout much of the animal kingdom, while the hexactinellids have lost atp8 and translocated cox2.

change is not seen in the demosponges or in other lower
metazoan taxa, but rather is known only from select bilaterian groups. The mtDNA of A. vastus, like the other glass
sponges, encodes only a trnI(gau) but heavily favors the
AUA codon to code for isoleucine (Table 2). It should be
noted that the A. vastus mtDNA was found to lack several
tRNAs, specifically for the amino acids aspartic acid,
glutamic acid, and threonine, and thus must import some
nuclear-derived tRNAs to complete translation.

Regions of synteny and unique transpositions among the
hexactinellids
The largest block of genes shared between A. vastus and
the previously published hexactinellid sponge mtDNAs
consisted of atp6-cox3-nad2-nad5-trnF-trnC-nad1-trn(L, I,
N, Y)-cob. Aphrocallistes contained trnI, N, and Y between
nad1 and cob, while I. panicea had trnL and trnY, and S. nux
retained the entire complement trnL, I, N, and Y. This
region of synteny spanned 7,127 bp of the A. vastus
mtDNA, or 41% of the genome (Figures 1 and 2). Aphrocallistes and I. panicea shared the cox2-rnl gene border,
while in S. nux these genes were shuffled to rnl-cox2. With

For each sponge species with a published mtDNA, the number of occurrences in protein coding sequence is given of codons with exceptional usage
(A.v., Aphrocallistes vastus; I.p., Iphiteon panicea; S.n., Sympagella nux; A.q. Amphimedon queenslandica; A.c., Axinella corrugata; G.n., Geodia neptuni; T.a.,
Tethya actinia; O.c., Oscarella carmela). The hexactinellid sponges strongly favor Ile(AUA) despite coding for a tRNA with (gau) specificity. AGR
codons (in bold) are reassigned from arginine to serine in the glass sponges. The hexactinellids rarely if ever employ the Trp(UGG) codon for
translation, but rather seem to use it as a signal for programmed frameshifting.

respect to hexactinellids, nad3 has transposed in the A.
vastus mtDNA, adjacent to cox1, whereas it is adjacent to
tRNAs and nad4L in I. panicea and S. nux. In A. vastus and
I. panicea, nad4 and nad6 are adjacent but found in the
opposite order. While nad6 has not been found in the
sequenced portion of the S. nux mtDNA, the gap in the
genome lies upstream of nad4. If nad6 is found in this gap
upon completion of the S. nux mtDNA sequence, S. nux
would share the nad4-nad6 boundary with A. vastus (Figure 2).
The mtDNA gene segment cox2-atp8-atp6-cox3 is a highly
conserved syntenic region found in arthropods, echinoderms, chordates, and other higher animal groups [10]. In
the choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis the order of these
four genes relative to one another is conserved, though the
genes are not found as a contiguous block [10]. Placozoan
mtDNA does not contain this synteny [12,17], but it is
present in all known demosponges except O. carmela (Figure 2) [13,15,16,19]. The synteny is also found in several
described mtDNAs of octocorallians [22]. Demosponges
appear to be the most basal animal group to retain this
plesiomorphy, as the hexactinellids have lost atp8 and
translocated cox2 (Figure 2). All sponge mtDNAs
sequenced to date revealed a highly conserved synteny
between the nad2-nad5 gene block. Meanwhile, the cox1tRNA(s)-nad1 region shared among the demosponges,
including O. carmela, was not found in any of the hexactinellid mtDNAs (Figure 2). Recall that nad1 was part of
the large hexactinellid-specific synteny described above.
Translational frameshifting in cox3 and nad6
Aphrocallistes cox3 and nad6 genes were found to contain a
+1 translational frameshift at amino acid position 140
and 58, respectively. In both cases, the predicted amino
acid sequence encoded by the cox3 and nad6 open reading
frames prior to this frameshift was highly similar to the Nterminal portion of diverse metazoan homologs. Coincident with the +1 frameshift in these genes, the predicted
amino acid sequence in frame 2 encoded the remaining Cterminal portion of these proteins based on multiple
alignments to poriferan, diploblast and bilaterian
homologs (Figure 4). The frameshift occurred precisely at
the codon UGG (tryptophan) for both genes. The UGG
codon has been suggested to play a role in translational
frameshifting in the other reported hexactinellids, albeit
in different genes than in A. vastus [14]. The amino acid
tryptophan was found in 72 other positions in the predicted A. vastus mtDNA proteome, each time coded for by
UGA (Table 2). The only two instances of the UGG codon
appeared precisely at the frameshifts in cox3 and nad6.
Moreover, the frame 1 tryptophan is replaced by a highly
conserved frame 2 glycine that is found in all taxa in the
alignment. Numerous other widely shared residues followed the glycine in frame 2 (Figure 4).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/33

One possibility is that the frameshift goes uncorrected and
that functional proteins are encoded by nuclear copies of
the genes. If this were the case, one would expect these
mitochondrial genes to have diverged under relaxed selective pressure. The multiple alignment shows, however,
that the amino acid sequences on both sides of the
frameshift have retained strong similarity to closely and
distantly related homologs (Figure 4). A second possibility is the frameshifts were corrected by RNA editing, as is
commonly seen in the mtDNA of plants, fungi, and protists [24-27]. To test this possibility, a randomly primed
cDNA pool was screened by PCR with cox3 and nad6 gene
specific primers flanking the UGG codon. The amplified
cDNA fragments from several independent PCR reactions
were sequenced. The results (unpublished data) showed
that all cDNA products contained the frameshift, (a) demonstrating that the mitochondrial genes are expressed,
and (b) ruling out the possibility of an RNA editing mechanism to restore the cox3 and nad6 reading frames.
Yet another possibility is that the frameshift was corrected
by translational frameshifting. A mechanism for +1 programmed translational frameshifting has been described
in Saccharomyces cerevisaie [28-31] and reported in disparate bilaterian animal groups [32,33]. The phenomenon
occurs in three steps: first, the ribosomal P site-bound
peptidyl-tRNA forms a "weak wobble interaction" with
the gene transcript; second, translation halts because the
next required tRNA is so rare that its codon is not readily
recognized; and lastly, an abundant aminoacyl-tRNA of
the +1 codon forces the ribosomal complex to shift frames
[30]. This scenario can be readily applied to the A. vastus
cox3 and nad6 genes. We hypothesize that translation
pauses due to poor recognition of the highly unusual
UGG tryptophan codon, allowing an abundant tRNAGly(GGA) to induce the +1 frameshift. This hypothesis
begs many questions. For example: How efficient is the
mechanism of frameshift correction? If the frameshift
lowers the translation efficiency of the affected genes, why
has selection allowed a frameshift to persist? Has this
mechanism evolved convergently in each disparate taxa,
or is it a shared but rarely employed tool available to any
animal whenever a frameshift becomes fixed in the mitochondrial genome?

Conclusion
The few sequenced hexactinellid sponge mtDNAs contain
a suite of shared traits, including the loss of the gene atp8,
retention of the gene atp9, highly divergent ribosomal
RNAs, and reduction of their tRNA complements. Hexactinellid nucleotide composition is distinct from that of
demosponges, favoring adenine over thymine and cytosine over guanine on the coding strand. The hexactinellid
mtDNAs share a large region of synteny spanning the atp6
to cob genes, but a syntenty putatively ancestral to the

Frameshifts in the cox3 and nad6 genes
Frameshifts in the cox3 and nad6 genes. The genes cox3 (A) and nad6 (B) in the A. vastus mtDNA both contain +1
frameshifts at the rare tryptophan codon UGG. After the UGG, the amino acid sequence of first frame (blue shading) becomes
degenerate and reaches a premature stop codon. Multiple alignment of these genes from closely- and distantly-related animal
taxa reveal conservation of the amino acid sequence in the +1 frame (pink shading), achieved by shifting from the codon UGG
to GGA (boxes).

Metazoa, cox2-atp8-atp6-cox3, is not retained. Perhaps the
most unique feature of hexactinellid mitochondrial
genomes is the predicted +1 programmed translational
frameshifting initiated by ribosomal pausing at the
extremely rare UGG (tryptophan) codon. Future mtDNA
sampling will reveal whether this phenomenon is common to yet more glass sponges or the other sponge classes.

Methods
Tissue preparation and DNA purification
The hexactinellid sponge Aphrocallistes vastus was collected
using the manipulator arm of the remote operated vehicle
ROPOS (Remote Operated Platform for Ocean Science;
ropos.com) at San Jose Islets, Barkley Sound, Canada, and
transferred without removal from seawater to tanks at the
Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre. Tissue was cut into
small pieces, and dissociated through Nitex mesh into
cold seawater and allowed to reaggregate over 2 days to
eliminate possible contamination by other taxa and to
facilitate DNA preparation. Aggregates were cleaned twice
daily with sea water and frozen directly at -80°C. The tis-

sue was thawed and lysed simultaneously in 8 M urea
buffer, incubated at 65°C for 20 min, and total DNA was
prepared by phenol chloroform extraction and precipitation in isopropanol [34].
mtDNA PCR amplification, cloning and sequencing
A genome walker library was constructed from A. vastus
genomic DNA using the GenomeWalker Kit (BD Biosciences) and restriction enzymes DraI, EcoRV, PvuII,
SmaI, and StuI. This library was screened by PCR with universal 16S primers and adapter primers AP1 and nested
AP2 to amplify a fragment of rnl. The initial contig was
generated with primer P1313 (caattcaacatcgaggtcgcaaaca)
and AP1(gtaatacgactcactatagggc). Genome-walking was
continued until a 12 kb contig had been partially
sequenced. Long-range primers designed against the ends
of this contig were successful in amplifying the entire contig using TAKARA LA-Taq. This product was purified using
the QiaQuick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen), sheared by sonication, and end-repaired with the DNA Terminator kit
(Lucigen). Two to four kilobase fragments were size-

selected by gel electrophoresis, blunt-end cloned into the
pSmart LC-Kan vector (Lucigen), and transformed into E.
cloni Supreme cells (Lucigen) by electroporation. Colonies were screened by PCR for the presence of inserts using
flanking vector primers SL1 and SR2 (Lucigen). Fortyeight PCR products were purified by poly-ethylene glycolNaCl (PEG:NaCl) [35] and sequenced by BigDye® Terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing on ABI PRISM® 3700 DNA
Analyzers (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) at the W.M. Keck
facility at Yale University, New Haven, CT. Outward facing
primers from the 12-kb contig were designed, and a 5.5 kb
fragment was amplified also using TAKARA LA-Taq following manufacturers instructions. This product was gelpurified with the Qiagen kit, ligated into the PCR 2.1
Topo vector (Invitrogen) and transformed into Top10
cells. Four clones were recovered, grown overnight in LB
and mini-prepped using Qiagen Qiaquick columns. All
four clones were sequenced by primer walking.
Sequence assembly and annotation
Sequences were assembled from chromatography data
using the Phred Phrap Consed software package, release
15.0 [36,37]. Regions of lower quality data were
sequenced by direct PCR on genomic DNA, or additional
sequencing of select gap spanning clones. The complete
contig had a minimum of 2× coverage with high phred
values (40 or greater) at each position. The suite of tRNA
genes were identified by tRNAscan-SE [21] using the program's default parameters for organellar DNA and the
Mold and Protozoan mitochondrial translation code.
BLASTN searches querying all published sponge mtDNA
tRNAs against the A. vastus genome did not identify any
additional tRNAs, nor did manual searching for missing
anticodon-loop motifs. Protein-coding and ribosomal
RNA genes were initially identified using the program
DOGMA [38], and then aligned by Blast2 [39] and ClustalW [40] with the mtDNA genes annotated in GenBank.
RNA extraction and cDNA preparation
One ml of frozen cell aggregate was pulverized under liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted from half of the
resulting ground tissue using the Illustra RNAspin Mini kit
(GE Healthcare). The total RNA was treated with Dnase I
for 1 hour, then cleaned by phenol chloroform extraction,
precipitated in cold 100% ethanol, and resuspended in
DEPC-dH2O with 1 µl RNase Inhibitor (Roche). 5 µg of
RNA was reverse transcribed with Invitrogen SuperscriptII
reverse transcriptase and random oligos, and the resulting
cDNA treated with RNase H. As a control for subsequent
PCRs, a sample of RNA was processed in parallel, receiving identical treatment except without reverse transcriptase enzyme ("no-RT control"). The cDNA and no-RT
control were used as PCR templates with primers pairs
P2775 (agcagaacaaagaccatgacc) and P2964 (tggaatcctgtggctacaaagaaag) for cox3 and P3182 (aacatcttcaagaa-

gaacaatcaatagag) and P2962 (catggttattatggtgcgttggatt) for
nad6, using Qiagen PCR reagents and manufacturer's
instructions. PCR products, amplified from the cDNA
template alone, were cleaned with the QiaQuick PCR
Purification kit (Qiagen) and sequenced directly using the
above primers.
