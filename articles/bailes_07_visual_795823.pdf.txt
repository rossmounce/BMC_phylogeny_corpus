Abstract
Background: One of the greatest challenges facing the early land vertebrates was the need to
effectively interpret a terrestrial environment. Interpretation was based on ocular adaptations
evolved for an aquatic environment millions of years earlier. The Australian lungfish Neoceratodus
forsteri is thought to be the closest living relative to the first terrestrial vertebrate, and yet nothing
is known about the visual pigments present in lungfish or the early tetrapods.
Results: Here we identify and characterise five visual pigments (rh1, rh2, lws, sws1 and sws2)
expressed in the retina of N. forsteri. Phylogenetic analysis of the molecular evolution of lungfish and
other vertebrate visual pigment genes indicates a closer relationship between lungfish and
amphibian pigments than to pigments in teleost fishes. However, the relationship between lungfish,
the coelacanth and tetrapods could not be absolutely determined from opsin phylogeny, supporting
an unresolved trichotomy between the three groups.
Conclusion: The presence of four cone pigments in Australian lungfish suggests that the earliest
tetrapods would have had a colorful view of their terrestrial environment.

Background
Vertebrate vision in both bright-light (photopic) and dimlight (scotopic) conditions occurs following the absorbance of light by a chromophore (based on either vitamin
A1 or A2) attached to a visual pigment protein (opsin)
within retinal photoreceptor cells (rods or cones). Opsin
proteins are a subgroup of G-protein coupled receptors
(GPCRs) with a seven transmembrane domain spanning
the photoreceptor outer segment membrane. Changes in
amino acids surrounding the binding pocket of the lightsensitive chromophore of the opsin can directly alter the
spectral sensitivity of the visual pigment. Opsins arise
from paralogous opsin genes, and the resulting visual pig-

ments maximally absorb light from different parts of the
spectrum from UV to near infrared (Fig. 1). Species from
most vertebrate classes possess one or more of a total of
five opsin genes; rh1 (medium wavelength-sensitive 1;
found in rods), rh2 (medium wavelength-sensitive 2;
found in cones), lws (long wavelength-sensitive; found in
cones), sws1 (UV/violet or short wavelength-sensitive 1;
found in cones), and sws2 (blue or short wavelength-sensitive 2; found in cones). The persistence, loss or duplication of these opsin genes reflects the spectral environment
and visual needs of a species [1-3]. While the opsin complement has been well studied in a number of aquatic and
terrestrial species [4-7], there remain large gaps in our

understanding of the evolution of vertebrate opsins, particularly among species representing the period prior to
the transition onto land such as the sarcopterygian, or
lobe-finned fish.
Sarcopterygian fish gave rise to the first tetrapods and are
represented today by the lungfishes (the Australian,
Neoceratodus forsteri; the African, Protopterus spp.; and the
South American, Lepidosiren paradoxa), and the coelacanth, Latimeria chalumnae. The relationship between all
early Sarcopterygii remains controversial and highly
debated despite the advent of phylogenetic analysis of
nucleotide and amino acid sequences [8-10]. Some
molecular analyses of sarcopterygian phylogeny reveal
that the lungfish is more related to tetrapods than to the
coelacanth, L. chalumnae [9], while others present an
unresolved trichotomy between all three groups [10]. Fossil forms of the lungfish family Ceratodontidae (genus
Ceratodus) first appear in the fossil record in the Triassic
period ([11] for review). The genus Neoceratodus (approx.
4 species, of which N. forsteri is the sole survivor) is found
in the fossil record from the Lower Cretaceous period 135
million years ago (mya) and therefore N. forsteri lays
claim to being the oldest surviving vertebrate genus [12].
Consequently, the visual system of N. forsteri may represent an evolutionary design most closely reflecting that
present just prior to the emergence of land vertebrates in
the Devonian period.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/200

The Australian lungfish Neoceratodus forsteri was thought
to have poor eyesight due to its small eye size, low spatial
resolving power [13,14], sluggish behaviour in captivity
[15-17] and ability to detect prey using electroreception
[18]. However, recent work on the retina of N. forsteri has
revealed four morphologically-distinct photoreceptor
types (one rod and at least three cones), some containing
colored intracellular filters that are otherwise only found
in terrestrial Orders [13,19]. Although a partial sequence
of the African lungfish Protopterus spp. rh1 opsin gene has
been previously published [[20]; Genbank: AF369054],
nothing else is known about lungfish opsins. The other
extant sarcopterygian fish, L. chalumnae, possesses only
two functional opsin genes, rh1 and rh2 and lives in a
photon-limited deep-sea environment [21]. Conversely,
N. forsteri inhabits a brightly lit, shallow freshwater habitat more similar to the environment from which terrestrial
evolution occurred [8]. This prompted us to investigate
the complement of opsins expressed in N. forsteri in order
to trace the evolution of photoreception in ancestral tetrapods.

Results and discussion
Opsin mRNA
We have characterised the full length cDNA coding
sequences of five visual opsin genes (rh1, rh2, lws, sws1
and sws2), one from each of the five image-forming vertebrate opsin groups, in N. forsteri. In addition, 3' RACE
experiments reveal multiple transcripts of rh1 utilising different polyadenylation (polyA) signal sequences within
the rh1 3' untranslated region (UTR). All five opsins are
expressed in the retina of sub-adult fish and the deduced
amino acid (aa) sequences yield polypeptides ranging in
size between 351–356 aa's. Lungfish opsins share highly
conserved residues known to be important in visual pigment function such as a glutamate counterion at aa site
113 (numbering follows that of bovine rhodopsin [22])
and a lysine residue forming the chromophore binding
site at aa site 296.

More than ten independent clones (from PCR experiments using both degenerate primers and in 3' and 5'
rapid amplification of cDNA ends) from at least two individual lungfish were sequenced for each opsin gene family
and, while there was evidence of polymorphism in the
gene pool (and/or possible sequencing error) with a variation between clones of up to 0.5%, there was no evidence
for gene duplications in individuals. We therefore conclude that we did not sequence paralogous opsins within
the five main vertebrate opsin groups in N. forsteri and
that the lungfish genome encodes a single copy of each
opsin gene. This is in contrast to opsin gene duplications
in teleost fish. Ray-finned fish (Actinopterygii) underwent
a whole genome duplication event around 350 mya, after
the divergence of the Sarcopterygii, and many lineages of

teleost fish are tetraploid ([23] and references therein),
whereas N. forsteri is a diploid animal [24]. In addition,
some species of teleost fish appear to have undergone
multiple opsin gene duplications independently [25].
These have accumulated subsequent amino acid changes,
resulting in differences in the maximum sensitivity of
opsins. These opsins can then be preferentially expressed
to fine-tune the animal's spectral sensitivity to environmental light, thus reflecting a degree of visual plasticity
[3,26]. For example, African cichlid fish determine their
spectral sensitivity by means of preferential expression by
up to seven available cone opsin genes [2,26,27].
Two rh1 polyA transcripts were successfully sequenced
from Neoceratodus forsteri (a third, faint band was also visible but not sequenced, fig. 2) and sequence analysis
shows that the two polyA signals are present in a tandem
array within the 3' UTR. This finding adds to increasing
evidence that multiple transcripts arising from tandem
polyA signals are a common, yet little studied, feature of
rh1 genes [28-31]. The longer lungfish rh1 transcript
shows a more intense band than the shorter transcripts
(Fig. 2A), which could be a result of differential stability
of the transcripts. There is evidence that some genes contain regulatory elements between polyA sites, which influence the stability of the longer mRNA transcript [32]. rh1
transcript levels in mice change according to circadian
rhythms, possibly due to inherent transcript stability or
even a circadian variation in competing mRNA processing
factors and therefore site preference [33]. The use of alternative polyA transcripts as a mechanism of rh1 gene regu-

lation therefore evolved early in vertebrate evolution and
has been selectively maintained in mammals.
Phylogenetic analyses
Phylogenetic comparison of codon-matched alignments
of both nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of
rh1, rh2, lws1, sws1 and sws2 with other vertebrate opsins
(Genbank accession numbers listed in Table 1) using two
fundamentally different methods of phylogenetic inference (both the Neighbour-joining (NJ) method and Bayesian inference via a Metropolis Markov chain Monte Carlo
simulation) reveals that lungfish opsins share more similarity with tetrapod opsins than those of other fishes (Figs.
3 and 4 and Additional file 1). Lungfish opsins form a
clade with tetrapod opsins rather than teleost fish in four
out of the five opsin families in each analysis, but different
topology is obtained between tree branches with low
bootstrap values or low posterior probability, in particular
within the rh1 and lws groups.

Phylogenetic analysis of rh opsin nucleotide sequences
does not favour the coelacanth as a closer relative to tetrapods than lungfish and further supports an unresolved trichotomy between the coelacanth, lungfish and early
tetrapods, which varies according to the gene family investigated and the method of analysis [10]. For example, the
phylogenetic tree produced using the NJ method with
nucleotide sequences places lungfish rh2 together with
tetrapod opsins rather than the coelacanth opsin gene.
Within the rh1 rhodopsin group, however, lungfish and
coelacanth sequences are placed together as a sister group

to the tetrapod rod pigments. Bayesian inference favours
the lungfish and coelacanth forming a sister group to the
tetrapods from both rh1 and rh2 sequences (Fig. 4). Conversely, comparison of amino acid sequences using the NJ
method [see Additional file 1] supports coelacanth opsins
forming a sister group to both teleost and tetrapod opsins,
while lungfish rh1 and rh2 genes are placed as both a sister group to teleost fish opsins (rh1) and tetrapod opsins
(rh2).
The fish-tetrapod transition occurred in a space of <20
million years around 400 mya [8] and a large array of
genes or whole genome sequences may therefore be
needed to resolve the trichotomy between sarcopterygian
fish [10]. It is unfortunate that the coelacanth genome
does not encode a functional sws1 pigment as sws1 genes
have recently been proposed as a good marker for vertebrate phylogenies [34].

The lungfish visual system
Our results demonstrate that the full complement of the
orthologues of the known vertebrate photoreceptive visual pigment genes are expressed in the retina of the Aus-

tralian lungfish, the nearest, and most primitive, extant
relative to the land vertebrates. Partial sequences of rh1
and lws have also been successfully amplified from the
more derived African lungfish Protopterus sp. (unpublished
data, H.J. Bailes, W.L. Davies, A.E.O. Trezise and S.P. Collin). An earlier molecular study of visual pigments in the
retina of a sarcopterygian fish (the coelacanth Latimeria
chalumnae) found only two opsins, rh1 and rh2 in addition to a pseudogene Ψsws1 [21]. The coelacanth inhabits
a photon-limited deep-sea environment and the move to
this low-light, shortwave-shifted environment meant that
the subsequent loss of three cone visual pigments (LWS,
SWS1 & SWS2 used for color vision in bright-light environments in other vertebrates [21]) was not a selective disadvantage, revealing a correlation between loss of opsin
genes and the spectral habitat/functional needs of a species [2]. Conversely, the retention of all five vertebrate
opsin families in N. forsteri suggests that the dipnoan lineage has lived in a brightly-lit colorful environment
throughout its evolutionary history, making it a more
appropriate model organism for the early tetrapod visual
system than the coelacanth.

Conclusion

Methods

The characterization of four cone opsins reveals the
potential for tetrachromatic vision in lungfish, although
behavioral work is needed to verify if lungfish can discriminate objects based on differences in chromatic hue.
Multiple opsins and a range of colored intraocular filters
in the retina of N. forsteri [13,19] suggest that it is adapted
for diurnal vision, in contrast to earlier reports that adult
lungfish are crepuscular [16,35]. Lungfish have a mostly
carnivorous diet [16] and may utilise color vision in prey
capture or reproductive behaviour. These findings indicate that the first tetrapods probably possessed eyes
adapted for chromatic diurnal vision, with all five opsins
expressed in the retina. Colored oil droplets within the
photoreceptors would have also filtered the incident light,
enhancing color discrimination by reducing the spectral
overlap of pigment absorbance curves [13,36].

One adult lungfish was caught by hook and line in the
Mary River near Tiaro, Queensland (Queensland Fisheries
Management Authority Permit No. PRM01599G). Three
subadult and two juvenile fish were bred in captivity and
donated by Prof. Jean Joss from Macquarie University,
Sydney, Australia. Animals were sacrificed using an overdose of benzocaine dissolved in acetone (according to
animal ethics guidelines of the University of Queensland
AEC No. ANAT/436/04/ARC). Australian lungfish are
listed as 'Vulnerable' under the Australian Commonwealth
Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act
1999 and as such only a limited number of animals were
available for this work.

individual adult and subadult eyes, or from pooled left
and right eyes for each juvenile fish used. Total RNA was
converted to cDNA using Superscript II (Invitrogen Corp.)
and random 9-mer or 16-mer oligo-dT primers. A series of
degenerate primers were designed to conserved regions
specific to each of the five vertebrate retinal opsin families
(rh1, rh2, lws, sws1 and sws2). Primers were used in nested
PCR on cDNA using standard methods [37]. Amplified
fragments were cloned into pBluescript vector (Stratagene
Inc.) and sequenced at the Australian Genome Research
Facility (AGRF Ltd.). Once sequenced fragments were
obtained and assembled, rapid amplification of cDNA
ends (RACE) at both the 5' and 3' ends was performed to
produce the full-length sequence of visual opsin mRNA.
Specific primers were then designed to the 5' and 3' ends
of each opsin and used in conjunction with a proof-reading enzyme (Phusion; Finnzymes Oy) to verify the full
length coding sequence of each opsin identified (rh1 forward TTA GGA GCT GCA ACC ATG AAC GGA ACA GAG,

sets was carried out using cDNA from additional individuals from those used in original opsin identification
experiments. In this way, each sequence was confirmed as
transcribed in at least two individuals.
Phylogenetic analyses
Full-length coding sequences were compared against
known sequences from other fish and tetrapods in the
Genbank database, and against an outgroup of Drosophila
melanogaster rh4 (Table 1). A codon-matched alignment
was carried out using ClustalW (European Bioinformatics
Institute) and by manual inspection. Phylogenetic analysis of nucleotides and corresponding amino acids was performed using MEGA3 [38] software and the Neighbourjoining (NJ) method [39] with 1000 bootstrap replications. The Tamura-Nei [40] model of DNA evolution was
used, with complete deletion and a homogeneous pattern
of nucleotide substitution among lineages and uniform
rates of nucleotide substitution across all sites. The NJ
method with 1000 bootstrap replications, a homogeneous pattern of substitution among lineages and uniform
rates of evolution was also used to infer phylogeny from
deduced amino acids using a Poisson correction substitu-

tion model. Phylogeny was also deduced using Bayesian
inference via a Metropolis-coupled Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) simulation using MrBayes 3.1 software
[41,42]. A general time-reversible model (GTR [43]) of
DNA evolution was used, with a gamma-shaped rate variation with a proportion of invariable sites. Two simultaneous runs were performed for 300,000 generations with
chains sampled taken every 1000 generations. The first 75
trees sampled (25%) were discarded as burnin. Consensus
trees were extracted in Treeview 1.6.6 [44].
