Abstract
Background: The walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) and Norwegian pollock (T.
finnmarchica) are confined to the North Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans, respectively, and
considered as distinct species within the family Gadidae. We have determined the complete
mtDNA nucleotide sequence of two specimens of Norwegian pollock and compared the sequences
to that of 10 specimens of walleye pollock representing stocks from the Sea of Japan and the Bering
Sea, 2 specimens of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), and 2 specimens of haddock (Melanogrammus
aeglefinus).
Results: A total number of 204 variable positions were identified among the 12 pollock specimens,
but no specific substitution pattern could be identified between the walleye and Norwegian
pollocks. Phylogenetic analysis using 16.500 homologous mtDNA nucleotide positions clearly
identify the Norwegian pollock within the walleye pollock species cluster. Furthermore, the
Norwegian pollock sequences were most similar to mitochondrial genotypes present in walleye
pollock specimens from the Sea of Japan, an observation supported both by neighbor-joining,
maximum parsimony, and maximum likelihood analyses.
Conclusion: We infer that walleye pollock and Norwegian pollock represent one single species
and that Norwegian pollock has been recently introduced from the Pacific to the Atlantic Oceans.

Background
The walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) is a commercially important codfish species confined to the North
Pacific Ocean from the Sea of Japan to the Gulf of Alaska
[1]. The population structure of walleye pollock has been
investigated by the use of various genetic markers including allozymes, microsatellites, and mitochondrial DNA

sequences. The structuring is still unclear despite identification of distinct stocks in geographic regions including
Sea of Japan, Sea of Okhotsk, Bering Sea, and Gulf of
Alaska [2-5]. The Norwegian pollock (T. finnmarchica) is a
very rare codfish species that was first discovered and
described in 1932, and with a geographical distribution
restricted to coastal regions of northern Norway for all the

ca 50 specimens so far recorded [6]. The Norwegian pollock closely resemble the walleye pollock, but previous
comparative examinations of morphological features
have concluded that the two pollocks represent distinct
species [7,8].
Mitogenomics is a high-resolution molecular genetic
approach that includes the complete mitochondrial
genome sequence (ca 16.500 bp) in the analyses. Mitogenomics, combined with molecular phylogenetics, has successfully resolved controversial issues of the origin and
genetic variation of modern humans [9,10], as well as
phylogenetic relationships among closely related fish species [11,12]. In the present study we have performed analysis that includes the complete mitochondrial genome
sequences from multiple individuals of Norwegian pollock (T. finnmarchica), walleye pollock (T. chalcogramma),
Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) in order to resolve the controversial relationship of the Theragra species.

Results
The complete mitochondrial genome sequence was determined for two individuals of Norwegian pollock (T.
finnmarchica), as well as one new individual each of Atlantic cod (G. morhua) and haddock (M. aeglefinus) (Table 1).
The mtDNAs were approximately 16.6 kb in length with
identical gene content and organization (13 protein coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes, and 22 transfer RNA
genes; Fig 1A) compared to previously published
sequences in Atlantic cod, walleye pollock and haddock
[13-15]. Heteroplasmy was detected in the ETAS
(extended termination associated sequence) region
within the control region in both Atlantic cod and Norwegian pollock. Atlantic cod mtDNA contains a heteroplasmic tandem repeat (HTR) motif of 40 bp that vary in copy
number from 2–5 [16,17]. Heteroplasmy at single sites
corresponding to that observed in walleye pollock [14]
was also found in Norwegian pollock mtDNA. Thus, the
ETAS region was excluded in subsequent phylogenetic
analyses.
Nucleotide substitutions and deletions were assessed by
comparing the complete mtDNA sequence of the 12 pollock specimens. The total number of variable sites identified was 204, and include all protein coding and
ribosomal RNA genes, the control region (D-loop), and 2
of the 22 transfer RNA genes (Fig 1B). Transition substitutions at third codon positions of protein coding genes
were the most common changes, and nucleotide deletions
were only observed at one site in the SSU rRNA gene as
well as in the ETAS region of the control region. However,
no specific substitution feature could be identified in any
of the Norwegian pollock sequences in comparison to
that of the walleye pollock sequences, including no

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/86

unique sites that distinguished the two proposed pollock
species. Yanagimoto et al. [14] identified a single nucleotide polymorphism in the ND4 gene as a diagnostic
marker of pollocks from the Sea of Japan and the Bering
Sea. Interestingly, both the Norwegian pollock specimens
harbour the Sea of Japan-type of nucleotide at this position (C11578 in the TF 19 sequence, Fig 1B).
A total of 16.500 nucleotide positions were unambiguously aligned from 16 specimens representing Norwegian
pollock (2 specimens), walleye pollock (10 specimens),
Atlantic cod (2 specimens), and haddock (2 specimens).
The two specimens of Atlantic cod and haddock were
selected in order to represent distant geographic locations
(eastern and western Atlantic for G. morhua, and North
Sea and northern Norway for M. aeglefinus). Pair wise distance within and between species are given in Table 2. In
all cases, except for the two pollock species, interspecific
p-distances were found to be significantly higher (approx.
10×) than distances within a defined species. Here, p-distances among the Atlantic cod specimens and the haddock specimens are 0.005 and 0.009, respectively, which
are similar to that of the 12 pollock specimens (range
0.002–0.005). The p-distances between genera are about
10 fold higher. This observation in the mitochondrial
DNA sequence is consistent with the conclusion that Norwegian pollock and walleye pollock are not genetically
distinct.
Phylogenetic analysis of the complete mitochondrial
genome data-set using maximum likelihood (ML), Neighbor-joining (NJ), and maximum parsimony (MP), all
resulted in a very similar tree topology (Fig. 2) with high
statistical supports. Interesting findings noted from the
complete mtDNA analysis are that the two Norwegian
pollock sequences cluster together with those of walleye
Pollock, and that the two Norwegian pollock sequences
are more closely related to walleye pollock sequences isolated from specimens in the Sea of Japan (J3 and J4) than
any of the specimens from the Bering Sea. From the
mitogenomic phylogeny analysis we infer that Norwegian
pollock and walleye pollock have to be considered as one
single species. The data implicates that the genus Theragra
consists of only one species confined to both the North
Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans, a situation similar to
that proposed for the Pacific cod (G. macrocephalus) and
Greenland cod (G. ogac) based on partial mtDNA
sequence analysis [18]. Although the genetic data are unequivocal, recent and extensive morphological examination of Theragra suggest that the formal taxonomic
designations are upheld, but at the subspecific level (SEF,
unpublished results).

Discussion
Our finding that the Norwegian pollock appears recently
derived from walleye pollock lineages within the Sea of
Japan, is puzzling. One possibility is that a subpopulation
of walleye pollock migrated from the North Pacific Ocean
into the North Atlantic Ocean through the Bering Strait
and Arctic Ocean, the only plausible connection between
the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans in the Northern Hemisphere. If so, the Norwegian pollock would be expected to
be more genetically similar to walleye pollock from the
Bering Sea than that from the Sea of Japan due to geographical distances. However, this assumption is not supported in our analysis. Furthermore, walleye pollock has
not been reported in the Arctic Ocean, between the Bering
Strait and coast of Norway, despite intense fishery activities over years [19]. Alternatively, walleye pollock could
have been introduced (intentionally or unintentionally)
by human to the northeast Atlantic from the Sea of Japan.
In fact, the Soviet Russian authorities did some experiments around 1930 on transfer of marine species by railway from Vladivostok to Murmansk (see http://
www.kartesh.com/texts/text.php?uid=46773), but currently there are no available documentations that include
walleye pollock. Whatever the reason may be, the pres-

ence of a small population of pollock in the North Atlantic Ocean is a very interesting observation and should be
included in ecosystem monitoring approaches [20] of the
Arctic Ocean.

Conclusion
Based on the complete mitochondrial genome sequences
we conclude that the walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) and Norwegian pollock (T. finnmarchica) represent one single species, and that Norwegian pollock has
been recently introduced from the Pacific to the Atlantic
Oceans.

Methods
Fish samples and DNA extraction
Specimens of T. finnmarchica (Tf. 19 and Tf. 21) were collected at May 11, 2003 and April 29, 2003, respectively, in
Norwegian coastal waters east of the North Cape. The G.
morhua specimen was collected off Newfoundland, Canada (NF1), and the M. aeglefinus specimen (No1) was collected off the coast of northern Norway. Key-features of
fish samples and mitochondrial DNA sequences used in
this study are listed in Table 1. DNA was extracted from
muscle tissue by using the mtDNA Extractor CT Kit from

Wako. The method makes use of differential centrifugation steps to obtain a crude isolation of the mitochondria
in the membrane fraction, lysis of the mitochondria, and
subsequent precipitation of the supernatant with sodium
iodide and isopropanol.
PCR amplification, cloning, and DNA sequencing
Primers (Table 3) designed from our published Atlantic
cod mtDNA sequence (X99772) [13] were used to amplify
1 – 4 kb fragments using one heavy (H) and one light (L)
strand primer. Each PCR reaction (25 μl) included solution, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.2 μM of each primer and 0.6 U of

Expand HiFidelity polymerase and buffer (Roche) in addition to the total DNA sample. The PCR reactions were performed in a Peltier 200 Thermal cycler with the following
cycling parameters: 94°C initial denaturation for 2 min,
30 cycles with 94°C denaturation for 15 sec, 53°C annealing for 30 sec, 68°C elongation for 2 – 3 min, and finally
72°C for 7 min. The total volumes were run on 0.8 or 1%
agarose gels containing ethidium bromide, and bands
were excised and purified with Qiagen gel extraction kit.
When appropriate, PCR products were inserted into the
pDrive vector (Qiagen) and transformed in E. coli EZ competent cells. Positive clones were verified with plasmid

isolation (Wizard plasmid purification kit) and EcoRI
restriction cutting followed by agarose gel electrophoresis.
In general, PCR products were sequenced on both strands
by using the BigDye version 3.1 kit (Applied Biosystems)
with the same primers as in the PCR and internal primers
(Table 3). The reaction mixture included 10 – 60 ng of the
PCR-template, 0,35 μM primer, 2 μl BigDye mix, 1 μl 5×
reaction buffer in a 10 μl volume. The sequencing products were analysed by an ABI genetic analyser (Applied
Biosytems).
Data analysis
In general, computer analyses of DNA sequences were performed using software package programs from DNASTAR
Inc. For the phylogenetic analyses, nucleotide sequences
based on 16.500 positions covering the complete mitochondrial genomes except the highly variable ETAS, were
used to make a multiple alignment as one single dataset
using ClustalX version 1.81 [21] and manual refinements.
MEGA version 3.1 [22] was used to estimate pairwise distances using the uncorrected p-distance model. Furthermore, MEGA was used to construct trees with the methods
of neighbor joining (NJ) using different distance matrices,
and maximum parsimony (MP) with heuristic searches
using close-neighbor-interchang (CNI) level 3 and production of initial trees by of random addition of
sequences (100 replicates). Maximum likelihood (ML)
analyses, based on the sequence evolution model
TMV+G+I selected by the program WinModeltest version
4b [23], were conducted with PAUP* (version 4.0 b10)
[24]. The reliability of tree branching points was assessed
by bootstrapping (2000 replications).
