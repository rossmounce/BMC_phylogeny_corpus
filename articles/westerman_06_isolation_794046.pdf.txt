Abstract
Background: To effectively analyze the requirements for protection to rotavirus infection, a
reliable animal model that reasonably mimics infection and disease in humans is needed. A
requirement for an effective animal model is the availability of appropriate rotavirus stocks for
challenge.
Results: A new simian rotavirus, designated YK-1, was isolated from a 2-year-old immunodeficient
pigtailed macaque with chronic diarrhea. YK-1 was distinguishable by electropherotype from the
other simian rotavirus strains, SA11 and RRV. One variant of YK-1, clone 311, which was isolated
after adaptation and plaque purification in cell cultures, displayed an unusual RNA electropherotype
with an abnormally migrating gene 11 segment. Sequence analysis demonstrated a genetic
rearrangement that involved a partial duplication of the gene 11 ORF encoding NSP5. YK-1 was
identified as a Group A rotavirus belonging to subgroup 1. To further characterize the YK-1 strain,
the genes encoding VP4, VP7, and NSP4 were sequenced. Analysis of VP4 and VP7 gene fragments
suggests that this strain is a G3P[3] rotavirus and is closely related to the simian rotavirus strain
RRV. Serotype analysis also identified YK-1 as a G3 rotavirus. The NSP4 genotype of YK-1 is C, the
same genotype as RRV.
Conclusion: This newly isolated rotavirus, YK-1, is being used to establish a nonhuman primate
model for studying the infectivity, immunity, and pathogenesis of rotavirus and for evaluating
candidate rotavirus vaccines.

Background
Rotaviruses have a wide host range and can be recovered
from many animal species [1]. The ability to isolate and
maintain rotaviruses and to use them in animal model
systems has contributed to studies of the mechanisms of

pathogenesis and immunity and to the development of
vaccines. Several rotavirus isolates and animal model systems have been successfully developed, including various
murine rotavirus strains in infant and adult mice [2-4],

C11 and Ala strains in rabbits [5], and human rotaviruses
with piglets [6].
Two simian rotavirus strains, SA11 and RRV, have been
well characterized and are currently the most widely used
reference strains in laboratories throughout the world [79]. The sequences of all 11 genomic segments of SA11 are
available. In limited studies, rotavirus infection and disease have been induced in nonhuman primates inoculated with SA11 [10-13]. Also, some human rotavirus
vaccines are based on the RRV strain or reassortants of
RRV with human strains [14]. The use of simian strains in
human vaccines was based on a Jennerianapproach
prompted by studies indicating that animal and human
rotaviruses share a common group antigen and that experimental animals immunized with human strains of rotavirus had a significantly lower risk of disease and
infectivity when subsequently challenged with animal
rotaviruses [15].
Although the two well-characterized simian rotavirus
strains are readily available for use as a challenge virus,
they have not been used consistently in nonhuman primate models of rotavirus infection because of their
numerous passages in cell culture, which is a common
method for viral attenuation. We wanted to isolate and
characterize a new simian virus that is with low passage
number in cell culture to be used as a challenge virus in
nonhuman primates. The isolate strain, designated YK-1
and its variant clone 311, is being used to establish a nonhuman primate model for studying the infectivity, immunity, and pathogenesis of rotavirus and for evaluating
candidate rotavirus vaccines [16,17].

Results
Rotavirus isolation and characterization
High titers of rotavirus antigen measured by an immunoassay were consistently detected in the stools of an
immunodeficient pigtailed macaque, PFm-1, which was
infected naturally with rotavirus and developed severe,
chronic diarrhea. Rotavirus-like virus particles were
detected by electron microscopy in stool extracts from this
macaque (data not shown). Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the viral RNA segments extracted from a stool
specimen from PFm-1 revealed an electrophoretic pattern
consistent with other rotaviruses, except for a lower intensity of segment 11 and an additional segment migrating
slightly slower than segments 7, 8, and 9 (data not
shown). This RNA electropherotype suggested that the
stool extract was a mixture of subpopulations of rotavirus,
as reported for other human rotavirus isolates with
genome rearrangements [18,19]. The rotaviruses from
PFm-1's stool extract were adapted to grow in MA-104 and
plaque purified, which revealed two distinct viruses,
named YK-1 and clone 311, that were distinguishable by

http://www.virologyj.com/content/3/1/40

plaque size and electropherotype (Figure 1a and 1b)
[20,21]. YK-1 produced smaller plaques and had an electropherotype typical of group A rotaviruses and that was
very similar to but distinct from RRV. Variant 311 produced larger plaques and had an RNA electropherotype
identical to that for YK-1, except it had an additional segment that was migrating slightly slower than segments 7,
8, and 9 and did not have a typical migrating segment 11.
Both YK-1 and 311 showed a cytopathic effect typical of
rotavirus grown in MA-104 cells and readily grew to titers
over 108 ffu per ml.
Variant 311 has a rearranged segment 11
The nucleotide sequence of segment 11 from YK-1 was
first determined as a reference. It consisted of 667 nt with
a 594-bp ORF flanked by 5' and 3' UTRs of 21 and 52 nt,
respectively. Segment 11 of YK-1 had 99% similarity to
segment 11 of RRV. In the variant 311, segment 11
migrated slower than that of YK-1 and RRV, as determined
by Northern blot analysis with a probe specific for segment 11 (Figure 1b). Sequence analysis of segment 11
from variant 311 identified a rearrangement consisting of
a partial duplication of segment 11 from YK-1. The rearrangement occurred at nt 626 in the 3' UTR with the
duplication of the ORF starting at nt 201 and included the
entire 3' UTR (Figure 1c). The sequence of variant 311's
segment 11 has 100% identity to YK-1's segment 11 both
in the ORF and in the partial duplication.
YK-1 group, subgroup, and serotype analyses
The VP6 protein of rotavirus confers group specificity that
is divided into seven groups (A to G). The commercial
immunoassay Rotaclone utilizes a monoclonal antibody
directed against the group A VP6 antigen and identified
YK-1 as a group A rotavirus [22]. Group A rotavirus strains
have been separated into four subgroups, and YK-1 is designated subgroup 1 as determined by reactivity with a subgroup 1 MAb 255/60 but not with subgroup 2 MAb 631/
9.

To predict the G and P serotype specificities of the YK-1
strain, the sequences of the genes encoding both VP7 and
VP4 were determined and compared with those of representatives of established G and P serotypes. The deduced
VP7 amino acid sequence of YK-1 was closely related to
other simian G3 rotavirus strains: 89% amino acid identity with RRV and 88% amino acid identity with SA11. A
phylogenetic tree was constructed that included known
VP7 amino acid sequences of G3 and other common G
serotypes (Figure 2). The YK-1 strain clustered with other
strains of G3 serotype, including RRV, SA11, AU1, and
YO. YK-1 was also identified as a G3 serotype by reactivity
with MAbs YO-1E2 (G3) and G3-159 (G3) in an immunoassay utilizing MAbs reactive to VP7-specific protein.
The predicted VP4 amino acid sequence of YK-1 closely

resembled that of GRV, a newly identified P[3]G3 caprine
strain, and that of RRV P[3]G3 (Figure 3) [23].
NSP4 sequence analysis
The NSP4 gene segment of YK-1 was sequenced and its
deduced gene product was compared with those of other
known rotavirus strains. The structure of the NSP4 gene of
YK-1 was similar to those of other rotavirus strains that
were sequenced previously. The gene consists of a 528-bp
ORF that encodes a protein with a predicted size of 175
amino acids with two conserved potential N-linked glycosylation sites. The deduced amino acid sequence of YK-1's
NSP4 was 98% similar to that of the simian RRV strain. At
least four genetic NSP4 groups are known, and the NSP4
of YK-1 can be classified as Group C by comparison of the
amino acid sequence (aa 131–148) of the variable portion
in the VP4 binding domain of various groups of NSP4
(Figure 4) [24,25].

Discussion
A rotavirus infection model using nonhuman primates
offers a highly relevant system to investigate the mechanisms of disease and immunity to rotavirus and to determine vaccine effectiveness [16,17,26]. Since nonhuman
primates are the animals most closely related to humans,
this model may be the best predictor of infection and
immunity in humans. In order to perform such studies, it
is necessary to have a rotavirus strain that will consistently
infect nonhuman primates after oral challenge. We
describe rotavirus isolates that were obtained from a naturally infected pigtailed macaque housed in a major primate
research
center.
This
monkey
was
immunosuppressed and had severe chronic diarrhea possibly due to the rotavirus infection. Two isolates were
obtained from a stool of this monkey and one designated
YK-1 had an electrophoerotype typical of most group A
rotaviruses and the other, designated 311, was identical to
YK-1 except for a rearrangement in gene segment 11 that
encodes for the NSP5 protein.

gene segment 11. Arrows indicate segment 11 of RRV and
YK-1, or rearranged segment 11 of variant 311.

The YK-1 and its variant clone 311 were fully adapted to
grow in cell culture, and both strains could produce
plaques on MA-104 cells, although the plaques from the
311 variant were larger than those from the YK-1 strain.
The significance of the difference in plaques size is not
known. Both YK-1 and 311 were identified as a group A
rotavirus, subgroup 1, genotype P[3] and serotype G3. It
is of interest that these characterizations of YK-1's G and P
types are very similar to another simian rotavirus strain,
RRV. The nucleotide sequence of the NSP4 gene from YK1 was also determined because of the discovery of the
NSP4 gene product as a viral enterotoxin and its implication in the virulence of rotavirus [27]. YK-1 was determined to have a group C NSP4 gene, which again was
similar to that of the RRV strain.

Group A rotaviruses with atypical RNA profiles due to
genomic rearrangements have been repeatedly detected in
stools of chronically infected immunodeficient children
[18,28]. These types of rearrangements have also been
detected in rotavirus isolates from apparently immunocompetent calves and rabbits [29-31]. We have also isolated an YK-1 variant, 311, with a rearrangement in gene
segment 11. With these rotaviruses, the rearrangement
results from a partial duplication of the gene with a normal 5' UTR followed by a normal ORF and a duplication
starting at various positions after the stop codon and
extending to the 3' end and leading to a long 3' UTR. Thus,
the rearranged gene expresses a normal protein product.
Although the function of this rearrangement is unknown,
it has been proposed to play a part in the evolution of
rotaviruses and to contribute to their diversity [32]. It has
also been suggested that rearranged segments containing
a partial duplication might be more efficient templates for

double stranded RNA synthesis than are their wild-type
counterparts and thus may be preferentially selected during viral replication [31].

Conclusion
Development of a more suitable animal model of rotavirus infection requires the identification of an appropriate
challenge strain. The ideal challenge virus should be isolated from the same species as that employed in the model
system because, in some systems, heterologous rotaviruses tend to undergo abortive replication. We have isolated a new rotavirus strain, designated YK-1, from fecal
specimens of a 2-year-old pigtailed macaque with severe
chronic diarrhea. The YK-1 strain had been used to
develop a nonhuman primate model to enhance our
understanding of the mechanisms of immunity to rotavirus infection [16,17]. This report describes the characterization of this new strain and a variant of this strain and

immunodeficent macaque, PFm-1, had chronic diarrhea
associated with high titers of fecal rotavirus antigen
detected by Rotaclone immunoassay (Meridian Diagnostics, Cincinnati, OH). The virus was isolated by previously
described methods with modifications [20,21]. An extract
from an antigen positive stool was prepared as a 20% (wt/
vol) suspension in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH
7.4) and centrifuged twice at 8500 g for 10 min for clarification. The supernatant was extracted with 1,1,2-trichlorotrifluoroethane (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), and centrifuged
at 4000 × g for 5 minutes. The extract was treated with
tryspin (15 _g/ml) for 45 min at 37°C and inoculated
onto a confluent monolayer of MA104 cells (African green
monkey kidney cells) for 1 h. After being washed, the
monolayer was maintained in serum-free minimal essential medium (MEM) (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 2 _g/ml tryspin and 50 _g/ml neomycin for
3 days. A viral lysate, obtained by freeze-thawing three
times and clarification at 8500 g for 30 min, was inoculated into MA104 cells and plaque purified three times.
Two distinct plaques distinguished on size were obtained
and further passed in MA104 cells.
Plaque assay
Virus stocks were activated with 15 _g/ml tryspin in MEM
for 45 min at 37°C. The activated virus was 10-fold serially diluted in MEM and 500 _l/well was inoculated onto
6-well tissue culture plates (Corning, Corning, NY) with a
confluent monolayer of MA104. After a 1 h incubation at
37°C, the inoculum was aspirated and 4 ml of a 3.5% agarose (Seakem, Biowhittaker, Rockland, ME) in MEM was
overlayed on the monolayer. The agar was allowed to
solidify at room temperature (RT), after which the plates
were incubated at 37°C. Plaques were visualized by adding 1 ml of MEM with 2% neutral red and 0.3% agarose 6
h prior to reading.
Purification of virus RNA
Rotavirus RNA was extracted from stools and infected cell
cultures by a modification of a previously described
method [33]. In brief, a 10% stool extract or 30% cell-culture suspension was prepared with Tris-buffered saline
supplemented with 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS),
vortexed, and incubated at RT for 10 min. Equal volumes
of virus and 1,1,2-trichlorotrifluoroethane were mixed for
1 minute, and centrifuged for at 8000 g for 10 min. The
supernatant was added to 2 volumes of 6 M guanidine isothyiocyanate and incubated at 56°C for 10 min. Silica
beads were added to each sample, vortexed, and incubated at RT for 10 min. The beads were washed once with
a 2:1 solution of 6 M guanidine isothyiocyanate with 50
mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and then three times with 70% ethanol. After the final wash, the beads were air dried, incubated with H2O for 10 minutes at 65°C, and centrifuged

http://www.virologyj.com/content/3/1/40

for 2 min at 10,000 g. The extract was saved and stored at
-70°C until use.
Electropherotyping
Rotavirus double-stranded genomic RNA extracted from
fecal samples and cell-culture lysates were analyzed by
SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described previously [34].
Northern blot for segment 11
The procedures employed for Northern hybridization and
chemiluminescent detection of bound digoxigeninlabeled probe using a commercial reagent (ECL, Amersham, Piccataway, NJ) have been described [35]. Two digoxigenin-labeled probes, ggcttttaaagcgctacagtgatgt and
ggtcacaaaacgggagtggggagctcc, were used to identify
genomic segment 11 of rotavirus.
Subgroup and serotype analyses
Subgroup and VP7 serotyping were determined by use of
a panel of monoclonal antibodies: 225/60 (Subgroup I),
631/9 (Subgroup II), KU-4 (G1), 5E8 (G1), S2-SG10
(G2), IC10 (G2), YO-1E2 (G3), G3-159 (G3), and ST-2G7
(G4) [36-38]. In brief, Immulon II plates (Nagle Nunc,
Rochester, NY) were coated overnight with serum from a
rabbit hyperimmunized with purified RRV rotavirus particles for positive wells and normal rabbit sera for negative
wells. After the plate was washed with wash buffer (PBS
plus 0.1% Tween 20), cell-culture lysates were added to
duplicate positive and negative wells. The plates were
incubated for 2 h at RT and washed. Specific monoclonal
antibodies were added to wells, and the plates were incubated for 1 h at RT and then washed. Biotinylated goat
anti-mouse IgG (Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham,
Al) was added, incubated 30 min at RT and followed by
washing and the addition of strepavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Southern Biotchnology). Wells were developed
by adding tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma) and stopped
after 10 min with 1 N HCl. A sample was considered positive if the OD value of the positive coated well was >2
times and 0.100 greater than the negative coated well.
PCR amplification and sequence analysis of VP4, VP7, NSP4, and
NSP5
The PCR products of the genes coding for VP4, VP7, and
NSP4 proteins were amplified with previously described
primers, Con2/Con3 for VP4, Beg9/End9 for VP7 and
10Beg16/10End722 for NSP4 [33,39,40]. Full-length PCR
product for the YK-1 gene coding the NSP5 protein was
amplified with primers derived from the 5' and 3' ends of
the NSP5 nucleotide sequence of the SA11 strain. The
nucleotide sequence of each gene was determined from
gel-purified PCR products as previously described [41].
Phylogentic relatedness of the VP4 and VP7 genes of YK-1
was examined by comparing amino acid sequences
