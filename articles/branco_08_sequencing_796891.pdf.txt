Abstract
Background: Arsenic (As) is a natural metalloid, widely used in anthropogenic activities, that can
exist in different oxidation states. Throughout the world, there are several environments
contaminated with high amounts of arsenic where many organisms can survive. The most stable
arsenical species are arsenate and arsenite that can be subject to chemically and microbiologically
oxidation, reduction and methylation reactions. Organisms surviving in arsenic contaminated
environments can have a diversity of mechanisms to resist to the harmful effects of arsenical
compounds.
Results: The highly metal resistant Ochrobactrum tritici SCII24 was able to grow in media with
arsenite (50 mM), arsenate (up to 200 mM) and antimonite (10 mM). This strain contains two
arsenic and antimony resistance operons (ars1 and ars2), which were cloned and sequenced.
Sequence analysis indicated that ars1 operon contains five genes encoding the following proteins:
ArsR, ArsD, ArsA, CBS-domain-containing protein and ArsB. The ars2 operon is composed of six
genes that encode two other ArsR, two ArsC (belonging to different families of arsenate
reductases), one ACR3 and one ArsH-like protein. The involvement of ars operons in arsenic
resistance was confirmed by cloning both of them in an Escherichia coli ars-mutant. The ars1 operon
conferred resistance to arsenite and antimonite on E. coli cells, whereas the ars2 operon was also
responsible for resistance to arsenite and arsenate. Although arsH was not required for arsenate
resistance, this gene seems to be important to confer high levels of arsenite resistance. None of
ars1 genes were detected in the other type strains of genus Ochrobactrum, but sequences
homologous with ars2 operon were identified in some strains.
Conclusion: A new strategy for bacterial arsenic resistance is described in this work. Two
operons involved in arsenic resistance, one giving resistance to arsenite and antimonite and the
other giving resistance to arsenate were found in the same bacterial strain.

Background
Arsenicals generated from natural and man-made sources
are widely distributed contaminants of freshwater,
groundwater and seawater. The biological availability and
physiological and toxicological effects of arsenic depend
on its chemical form and oxidation state; the organic
forms are the less toxic. Among inorganic forms, arsenite
[As(III)] is reported to be on average 100 times more toxic
than the less mobile arsenate [As(V)] for most biological
systems [1]. However, the toxicity of arsenic to organisms
also depends on both endogenous factors (e.g. the membrane oxyanion uptake and efflux pumps) and exogenous
factors (e.g. mobility of arsenic forms) [2].
There are many environments containing high amounts
of arsenic. However, many organisms can survive in such
sites, including bacteria, fungi, algae and plants. These
organisms have developed mechanisms for arsenic resistance. These mechanisms can include arsenite oxidation
(aox genes), respiratory arsenate reduction (arr gene) or
arsenic resistance by arsenite extrusion (ars gene) for cytoplasm defence. Arsenic resistance (ars) genes are found in
several microorganisms gram-positive and gram-negative
and are located either in the chromosome or in the plasmid. Most ars operons consist of three genes: arsR, arsB
and arsC, and most of the knowledge about these genes
comes from studies of ars operons in Escherichia coli [3],
Pseudomonas aeruginosa [4] and Staphylococcus species
[5,6]. Some ars operons such as those carried by E. coli
plasmids R773 [7] and R46 [8] and Acidiphilium multivorum plasmid pKW301 [9] have five genes arsRDABC. The
arsR gene encodes a regulatory protein [10] that control
the levels of ars operon expression, while arsD gene
encodes for a protein first identified as a regulator [11]
and recently reported as a metallochaperone for the
arsenic that enhances resistance by delivering this metalloid to the ArsAB efflux pump [12,13]. The ArsA protein is
an arsenite-stimulated ATPase, which forms a complex
with ArsB, the transmembrane arsenite efflux pump [14].
ArsC is an arsenate reductase which reduces arsenate to
arsenite that can then be pumped out of the cell [15,16].
The second family of arsenite carriers has been much less
characterized and includes the arsB gene of Bacillus subtilis
[17] and the Acr3 gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae [18].
Another gene, arsH, without a clear function described,
has been found close to arsenic resistance genes in Yersinia
enterocolitica [19], in Acidothiobacillus ferroxidans [20], in
Serratia marcescens [21], in Synechocystis sp. [22], Sinorhizobium meliloti [23,24] and Shigella flexneri [25]. In addition
to the above mentioned arsenic resistance operons, a
broad diversity of ars operons have been described in different species [26-31].
Species belonging to the genus Ochrobactrum have been
isolated from clinical and from environmental samples.

Ochrobactrum tritici SCII24 was isolated from soil by Lebuhn et al. [32] however, either its oxyanion resistance or
its genetic characterization were not reported. In this
paper, we studied the ability of this strain to resist arsenic
and antinomy species, and we report the identification of
the genes involved in arsenic resistance in O. tritici. We
also describe the expression of the ars genes in E. coli
AW3110 and discuss the function of each ars gene.

Results
Arsenic resistance of Ochrobactrum tritici SCII24T
Tolerance to arsenite, arsenate and antimonite were tested
in O. tritici SCII24. This strain was able to grow in presence of As(III) up to 50 mM or up to 10 mM Sb(III), and
also demonstrated high arsenate resistance, growing at
concentrations higher than 200 mM (solubility level of
arsenate in this medium).
Nucleotide sequence of the ars genes
A fragment carrying the arsB gene and another fragment
containing the arsC gene were cloned from a gene library,
and the sequences of these two gene clusters were determined using specific oligonucleotide primers. Five potential open reading frames (ORFs) were identified in operon
ars1 and six ORFs were found in operon ars2 (Fig. 1). The
characteristics of the predicted products of these ORFs are
shown in Table 1. Based on the BLAST analysis, the first
cluster is composed by four ORFs, which encode proteins
that belong to families of well-known proteins involved
in arsenic resistance, ArsR, ArsD, ArsA, ArsB and an additional gene coding for a CBS domain (Cystathionine-βSynthase), usually not related with arsenic resistance.
ORF1 (arsR1) encodes an arsenite regulatory protein
(ArsR) with 109 aminoacids and shows clear homologies
to ArsR proteins from different organisms. The ArsR1
from O. tritici has two cysteines (Cys42 and Cys45)
instead of the typical highly conserved putative helix-turnhelix DNA binding motif (ELCVCDLC) well identified in
plasmid R773 of E. coli (Fig. 2A). Shi et al. [33] indicated
that arsenite only interact with two cysteines of this motif,
therefore the presence of 2 cysteines should be enough for
arsenic interaction and conformational change of the protein. The second gene, arsD encodes a protein of 124
amino acids, which is homologous of the ArsD proteins
recently reported as metallochaperone [11,12]. Like others ArsD, this protein also has two pairs of vicinal
cysteines, Cys12–Cys13 and Cys112–Cys113, normally
involved in inducer binding. The next gene of the group,
arsA comprises 582 aminoacids, and was described as
encoding an ars anion-translocating ATPase (ArsA). ArsA
consists of two homologous halves, N-and C-terminal
domains connected by a short linker sequence. Each
domain contains a consensus sequence (GKGGVGKT) for
ATP binding and a metalloid binding domain (Cys113,
Cys172, Cys422, His148, His451 and Ser420), in agree-

ment with what it was observed for ArsA proteins of other
organisms. The next ORF encodes a 175 aa protein with
identity to CBS-binding domains of several families of
proteins. The last gene of this cluster (arsB) encodes a
putative arsenite efflux transporter ArsB, with 430 aminoacids.
The nucleotide sequence of the second cluster of the ars
genes revealed six ORFs that corresponded to arsR2,
arsC1, Acr3, arsC2, arsH and arsR3. The first gene of this
group encoded a transcriptional regulator belonging to
ArsR family without the typical CXCXXC arsenite-binding
motif of pR773 ArsR (Fig. 2A). The next gene, arsC1,
encoded a predicted protein of 137 aa, which is homologous of the ArsC protein family represented by E. coli
pR773 (Fig. 2B), that uses glutathione and glutaredoxin as
electron sources. The third gene was a putative arsenite
carrier homologous to ACR3 protein and comprises 352
aa. The ORF4 of this cluster was a second arsC gene,
encoding a protein (175 aa) with sequence similarity to

the thioredoxin-dependent arsenate reductases related to
the low molecular weight phosphatase family. In fact, this
type of arsC comes from evolution of ancient tyrosine
phosphatase protein. Downstream of the arsC2 gene was
found a homologous of a gene previously identified as
arsH. This gene was recently identified in a few ars operons, although its function remains unclear. Recently, published work demonstrates that ArsH protein is an atypical
flavodoxin with a non-canonical FMN binding site that
catalyzes oxidation of NADPH, generating H2O2 and
with a low azoreductase activity [24,25]. The last ORF also
showed similarity with a family of arsenic regulatory proteins and therefore it was named arsR3. Unlike all the
other genes this protein is divergently transcribed. Alignments of the three different ArsR proteins (ArsR1, ArsR2
and ArsR3) revealed that ArsR2 was more similar to ArsR3
(36% identity and 55% similarity) than to ArsR1 (33%
identity and 48% similarity). However, no significant
similarity was found between ArsR1 and ArsR3 or
between ArsC1 and ArsC2 proteins. "Neural Network Pro-

was separated from the -35 region (TTGCCA) by 17 nucleotides. In ars2 operon, two motives estimated as putative
promoters were found upstream and downstream of
arsR2 and arsR3 genes, respectively. In this case, we also
identified the putatives -10 (TATATA and TATCCT) and 35 (TTATCA and TTGTCG) promoter boxes separated by
17 nucleotides.
Expression of O. tritici ars gene products in E. coli
Before investigating the role of O. tritici ars genes in
arsenic resistance, we examined which polypeptides were
expressed in E. coli by using a polyacrylamide gel. When
the transformant carrying the complete ars1 operon was
cultivated in the presence of arsenite or antimonite, only
one additional polypeptide was produced in large
amount (Fig. 3). This protein identified by comparison as
ArsA, had approximately 63 KDa that was consistent with
the size predicted from the aminoacid sequence (62.6
KDa).

However, this protein was not found when the same clone
was grown in the absence of arsenite or antimonite. Furthermore, all different clones without arsR1 gene cultivated in the presence or absence of these chemicals were
always able to produce this ArsA protein, indicating that

ArsR worked as a repressor protein in E. coli. In contrast,
all of the others ars products (ArsR1, ArsD, CBS domain,
ArsB, ArsR2, ArsC1, ACR3, ArsC2, ArsH and ArsR3) were
not found in the total proteins of E. coli.
Ability of the cloned O. tritici ars gene products to confer
arsenic and antimony resistance in E. coli AW3110
Different constructs of the ars genes were used to evaluate
the role of these genes in arsenic resistance in E. coli
AW3110. All experiments were done in the presence of 0.5
mM IPTG as inducer and the cultures were analyzed for
their ability to grow on increasing concentrations of
arsenite, arsenate and antimonite (Fig. 4). Cells carrying
the constructs from ars1 operon parsRDAcbsB, parsDAcbsB, parsAcbsB and parscbsB showed equivalent levels
of resistance to As(III) (Fig. 4A). On the other hand, resistance to arsenite was not found in cells carrying the empty
vector, or containing the constructs with each of the following genes: arsA (parsA), arsB (parsB), cbs (pcbs), arsA
and cbs (parsAcbs).

The experiments related to arsenite resistance by ars2
operon, showed that this second operon also conferred
As(III) resistance to E. coli cells, but at a lower level than
the resistance conferred by operon ars1. Comparing the

Lane1, marker proteins, lane2, plasmid pTRC 99A without an insert; lanes 3, 4 and 5, construct parsRDAcbsB in absence of any oxyanion, in presence of 1 mM As(III) and 1 mM Sb(III), respectively; lanes 6, 7 and 8, construct parsDAcbsB without any oxyanion, in presence of 1 mM As(III) and 1 mM Sb(III), respectively.

different constructs of ars2 operon (Fig. 4B), the clone
with all genes (parsR2C1Acr3C2HR3) showed the highest
As(III) resistance. Cells carrying the constructs
parsR2C1Acr3C2H, parsAcr3C2HR3 and parsAcr3C2H
showed equivalent levels of resistance to As(III). The constructs parsAcr3C2 and parsAcr3 conferred similar resistance, although at a lower level than the previous
constructs and this was more evident for high As(III) concentrations. When the experiments were conducted in the
presence of arsenate, we observed that only the cloned
ars2 genes increased the level of resistance of the host
strain. Therefore, abilities of parsR2C1Acr3C2HR3 and
subclones to confer resistance to arsenate were tested (Fig.
4C). All the combinations of the multiple ars genes tested
conferred similar levels of resistance to As(V). Constructs
containing the individual genes did not confer resistance
to the host strain except for cells that expressed the arsC
gene, which showed a slight resistance to this oxyanion.
These experiments are in agreement with the notion that

arsCs encode for arsenate reductases, involved in As(V)
detoxification. The ars1 operon was also responsible for
antimony resistance, but the ars2 operon was not able to
confer resistance to this oxyanion. The figure 4D shows
that clones, parsDAcbsB, parsAcbsB and parscbsB conferred
Sb(III) resistance to E. coli cells, as well as the construct
parsRDAcbsB although at an intermediary level. Clone carrying only arsB grew less than the wild type in the absence
of metal and was not resistant to arsenite. One possibility
is the toxicity of the ArsB protein in E. coli [9] since in the
absence of IPTG, clone carrying only parsB grew as well as
the will type (data not shown). On the other hand,
parscbsB did not induce toxicity in E. coli and clone was
arsenite resistant. It is possible that the co-transcription of
CBS is required for a correct function of ArsB. The cbs gene
encodes a protein with a CBS domain that probably
dimerizes to form a stable globular structure with ArsB
[35].

Gene induction experiments
RT-PCR was used to test if each ars gene cluster forms a
unique transcriptional unit. RT-PCR products related to
all ars1 genes were obtained showing that genes were transcribed from one independent mRNA (Fig. 5). The RTPCR experiments for ars2 also showed products for all
genes demonstrating that all genes were transcribed from
the same operon (data not shown).

was detected in both strains of O. tritici (SCII24 and
5bvl1). Using the Acr3 probe a hybridization signal was
obtained from preparations of O. tritici (SCII24 and
5bvl1) and type strain O. anthropi. Southern blot experiments performed with arsC2 and arsH probes yielded a
signal for all of the Ochrobactrum strains tested except for
type strain O. intermedium.

Discussion
Detection of ars genes in other Ochrobactrum strains by
Southern blot
Specific probes for structural ars genes (arsA, cbs domain,
arsB, arsC1, Acr3, arsC2 and arsH) were designed to determine the presence of the ars genes in other strains belonging to the genus Ochrobactrum. Total DNA from these
strains was analyzed by Southern blot (Fig. 6). The genes
arsA, arsB and the gene coding for the CBS domain were
only detected in strain O. tritici SCII24 and the arsC1 gene

The ability of strain O. tritici to resist up to 50 mM As(III),
10 mM Sb(III) and more than 200 mM As(V), turns this
bacterium into one of the most resistant microorganisms
described to date, most probably due to the presence of
two functional ars operons (ars1 and ars2) even if the presence of other mechanisms in the cell, participating in
arsenic resistance, can not be overruled. The ars1 operon
conferred resistance to arsenite and antimonite and ars2
was responsible for resistance to arsenite and arsenate.

RT-PCR analysis of ars1 genes of O. tritici SCII24.
Total RNA isolated from O. tritici cells in the exponential
phase was used as template in a reverse transcriptase reaction using the reverse primer from arsB to generate cDNA.
Then, the several intergenic regions were amplified: arsRarsD (ane1), arsD-arsA (lane2), arsD-cbs (lane3) and cbs-arsB
(lane 4).

Therefore, O. tritici is the first bacteria characterized which
contains 2 operons involved in arsenic resistance each one
conferring resistance to different metals or metal states.
Although, several arrangements of arsenical resistance
operons are possible in Bacteria, usually the genes that
confer resistance to As(III) and As(V) are present in the
same operon [reviewed in [15,16,36]]. In O. tritici the ars
operons showed an unusual genetic composition. The
organization of ars1 operon displayed some similarities
with the well-known ars operon on the plasmid pR773 [7]
and pR46 of E. coli [8], including the genes arsR, arsD, arsA
and arsB. However, the arsC gene (arsenate reductase) was
not identified in the O. tritici ars1 operon. A second atypical feature was the presence of one additional ORF usually not associated with ars genes, which codes a protein
with a CBS domain. CBS domains are small domains of
unknown function, which were only reported on ars genes
cluster of Acidithiobacillus caldus present on a Tn21-like

transposon [26] and on transposon, TnLfArs of Leptospirillum ferriphilum [27].
The ars2 operon of O. tritici could be also differentiated
from previously described ars operons. One of the differences was the presence of two arsR genes with opposite
orientations. While arsR2 gene was located upstream with
the same orientation as arsC1Acr3C2H, the arsR3 was
located downstream and was divergently transcribed.
Another intriguing characteristic was the presence of two
arsenate reductase genes, arsC1 and arsC2, encoding distinct ArsC protein families. The ArsC1 belong to the family represented by the E. coli pR773 ArsC that uses

glutathione and glutaredoxin as electron sources [37]. In
contrast, the ArsC2 belong to the family represented by
the S. aureus pI258 ArsC that uses thioredoxin as an electron source [38]. The arsR is commonly found in ars operons and its regulatory function, towards the basal operon
expression, has been demonstrated [5,9,30]. For most of
these trans-acting ArsR regulatory proteins, even with proteins with low homology, the consensus sequence for
metal binding (ELC32VC34DLC37) was found. However,
the three ArsRs from O. tritici had a very low or even no
homology between them and they did not show the typical arsenite-binding motif (Fig. 2). The absence of conserved metal binding box was also previously identified in
Corynebacterium glutamicum [29] and in Acidithiobacillus
ferroxidans [20]. In the case of A. ferroxidans, Qin et al. [39]
proved the involvement of a vicinal cysteine pair, Cys95,
Cys96 and a third residue Cys102, in the transcriptional
regulation by trivalent metalloids. In O. tritici, it was
apparent that ArsR1 could function as a repressor since
the expression of the arsA gene (visible from SDS polyacrylamide gel) depended on the presence of the inducer.
The most probable regulatory role of the remaining arsRs
genes could not be evaluated, because the ars2 operon
products were not detected by polyacrylamide gel. The
arsD, together with the arsR, has been associated to the
control of the maximal level of ars operon expression preventing the overexpression of ArsB [40], which is toxic in
excess. Our results also illustrate the toxic effect of ArsB,
since the overproduction of this arsenite efflux pump
(ArsB) had a deleterious effect on E. coli cells. The experimental data of this work do not support the regulatory
function of the ArsD over ArsB expression, since E. coli
cells that did not carry the arsD gene (constructs parsAcbsB
and parscbsB) showed similar resistance as the constructs
with arsD, although the role of metallochaperone-mediator can not be excluded. The arsB gene product could not
be detected in E. coli by SDS-PAGE as was previously
reported by other authors [9]. Nevertheless, in contrast to
other operons [4,41], the O. tritici arsB gene alone was not
able to confer resistance to arsenite and antimony. However, the presence of the CBS domain in addition to arsB
gene was enough to increase the resistance to these metalloids. CBS domains are found in a wide range of other
unrelated proteins and in some of them a regulatory role
of the protein structure has been suggested [35]. Therefore, in O. tritici it is possible that the protein with identity
to CBS-binding domain may play a role as a structure
decreasing the toxicity of the ArsB. As we mentioned
before the ars2 operon also conferred resistance to As(III),
although the ars2 operon was the only one responsible for
arsenate detoxification. A second arsenite efflux pump
was located in the ars2 operon, but, differently from arsB,
this one was phylogenetically near to arsenite transporter
familly-ACR3, represented by Saccharomyces cerevisiae

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/95

[18]. O. tritici ACR3 protein as well as yeast Acr3p catalyzes extrusion of arsenite from the cells conferring arsenite but not antimonite resistance. As expected, ACR3 was
not homologous to the ArsB found in operon ars1, even
though they both function as arsenite efflux pumps.
Arsenate resistance in O. tritici could involve only one or
both arsC genes to convert As(V) to As(III), since we
observed that not only the ArsC1 was functional in E. coli,
but also the ArsC2 usually related to gram-positive ArsC
family. ArsC reductases from different phylogenetic
groups were already showed to be functional in E. coli
[41]. The arsenite produced was then pumped out from
the cells by ACR3 protein. An arsH-like gene was also
located in operon ars2. The gene arsH was first described
as a regulator [19] but no specific role could be conferred
to arsH in A. ferroxidans [20] and in plasmid R478 of S.
marcescens [21]. Recently, in Sinorhizobium meliloti [24]
and in Shigella flexneri [25], ArsH was described as a H2O2forming NADPH:FMN oxidoreductase that also reduces
azo dyes. O. tritici arsH gene did not have any effect in
arsenate resistance and was not fundamental to arsenite
resistance, however, the removal of this gene resulted in a
reduction of arsenite resistance by E. coli cells in the presence of high levels of As(III). Therefore, a similar role to
that proposed for the Sinorhizobium ArsH can be expected
since homology studies of ArsH from O. tritici showed
that the protein belongs to the same NADPH-dependent
FMN reductase family.
Southern blotting did not reveal ars1-homologous
sequences in the other type strains of the genus Ochrobactrum, but signed the presence of the ars2 genes in some of
these bacteria. It is interesting to note the concurrent
absence of the first cluster of genes along with strain-sensitivity to As(III) and Sb(III), suggesting the involvement
of ars1 operon in detoxification of both oxyanions in
these strains. In contrast, the detection in Ochrobactrum
strains of genes from ars2 operon along with arsenate
resistance may reflect the relation between the presence of
ars2 genes and arsenate resistance.

Conclusion
This work illustrates the presence of operons ars1 and ars2
in O. tritici and its possible involvement in arsenic resistance showed by E. coli heterologous complementation
analysis. Operon ars1 seems to code for the main arsenite
detoxification system and is entirely responsible for antimonite resistance in this strain. Operon ars2 encodes a
group of different proteins with the arsenate detoxification as main function, and additionally is involved in
arsenite resistance. This operon includes genes coding for
arsenate reductases with different phylogenetic origins.

Methods
Strains, plasmids and culture conditions
The strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in
Table 2. E. coli XL1-Blue and E. coli AW3110 were used as
hosts for the cloning vectors or expression vectors. E. coli
was grown in LB medium containing, per litre, 10 g of
tryptone, 5 g of yeast extract, and 5 g of NaCl. Ampicillin
(100 μg/ml) and isopropyl-thio-ß-D-galactoside (IPTG)
(0.5 mM) was added to the medium, as required. For
some experiments, cells were grown in a low-phosphate
medium.

This medium contains in g/l, Tris 6.06 (pH 7.0), NaCl
4.68, KCl 1.49, NH4Cl 1.07, Na2SO4 0.43, MgCl2.6H2O
0.2, CaCl2.2H2O 0.03, Na2HPO4.12H2O 0.23 and glucose
5.0. Analytical-grade salts of NaAsO2, KH2AsO4 and
C4H4KO7Sb.0.5H2O (Sigma) were used to prepare 0.5 M
stock solutions. Metalloid-containing medium was solidified with 20 g of Bacto-Agar (Difco Laboratories) per litre.
Construction of an O. tritici SCII24T gene library
The following degenerate pairs of 5 oligonucleotides were
designed based on conserved regions of several prokaryo-

tes arsenic resistance genes, arsB and arsC, available from
public databases: forward primers 5'-GTG/CATC/
TTGGCAA/GCCG/CAAA/GGG-3' and 5'ACG/CATC/
TTAC/TCAC/TAAC/TCCG-3'; reverse primers 5'GTG/
CGGCATA/GTTA/GTTCATA/GAT-3' and 5'TCGCCA/
GTCC/TTCC/TTTG/CGTA/GAA-3', respectively. PCR fragments of 0.97 Kb for arsB gene and 0.35 Kb for arsC gene
were amplified from O. tritici with these primers (purchased from Sigma Genosys). These fragments were subsequently used as probes for the isolation of the complete
gene from the library. Total DNA was isolated from O. tritici as previously described [42]. Two partial genomic
libraries from this strain, containing DNA fragments
selected by Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA with
the 0.97 Kb and 0.35 Kb fragment probes, were obtained
by complete digestion of total DNA with restriction
enzyme HindIII (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), followed by ligation of purified fragments of around 5–9 Kb
into the HindIII site of pUC18 (Invitrogen) and subsequent transformation of E. coli XL1-Blue with the ligation
mixture. Clones were selected for their resistance and positive clones were confirmed by colony hybridization with
a digoxigenin-labeled probe (Roche Molecular Biochemi-

cals). Inserts of positive pUC18 clones and pGEM-T Easy
(Promega) clones were sequenced by using vector-and
insert-specific oligodeoxynucleotide primers. DNA
sequencing was performed by using a BigDye Terminator
v1.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems) using a
model ABI310 automatic DNA sequencer. Nucleic acid
and protein sequence analyses were performed with
BioEdit editor [43]. Comparison searches were performed
by using the BLAST program of the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI).

ers from arsB and arsH genes were used to create the cDNA
for each ars gene clusters. cDNAs were used as template for
the second PCR amplification reaction. For monitoring
the expression of ars1, were used 5 μl of the RT reaction
and specific primers designed to amplify a region spanning the junction of the different genes of operon ars1 and
operon ars2. RT-PCR products were examined by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. DNA contamination of the
mRNA was determined by PCR using Taq polymerase
without reverse transcriptase.

Identification of the ars gene products
The ars genes were amplified by PCR using specific forward and reverse primers containing additional XbaI and
HindIII recognition sites, respectively. The PCR products
were purified after digestion with XbaI and HindIII and
ligated into the corresponding sites into the pTRC 99A
expression vector (Amersham Biosciences). Then, each
construction was transformed into competent E. coli
AW3110. Cells bearing each plasmid were grown at 37°C
overnight in LB medium containing ampicillin. Overnight
cultures were diluted 100-fold into fresh LB medium containing ampicillin alone or with arsenite, or with arsenate,
or with antimonite. When the absorbance at 600 nm
reached 0.8 to 1.0, 0.5 mM IPTG was added to the culture
to induce gene expression, and cultivation was continued
for 6 hours. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and dissolved in a loading buffer for sodium dodecyl sulfate
(SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Total
proteins were analyzed on 12% – 15% polyacrylamide
gels.

Southern hybridization
Southern blot analysis was performed as described by
Sambrook et al. [42]. Purified DNAs (10 μg) of strains O.
tritici SCII24, O. tritici 5bvl1, O. grignonense OgA9a, O.
anthropi LMG 3331 and O. intermedium LMG 3301 were
subjected to digestion with restriction enzymes and electrophoresed on agarose gel [0.8% (w/v)]. DNA was capillary transferred for approximately 16 h to a nylon
membrane in 0.4N NaOH, 1 M NaCl buffer followed by
neutralization. DNA probes for structural genes [arsA, cbs
domain, arsB, arsC1, Acr3, arsC2 and arsH] were amplified
by PCR using gene-specific primers, recovered from agarose gels and purified with Wizard SV Gel and PCR CleanUp System (Promega). Each probe was labelled with dioxigenin-dUTP nonradioactive (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and the subsequent pre-hybridization and
hybridization with the membrane were performed at
45°C to 58°C using DIG High Prime DNA Labelling and
Detection Starter Kit II, following the manufacturer's
instructions. The membrane was washed twice with 2×
SSC-0.1% SDS at room temperature and twice with 0.2×
SSC-0.1% SDS for 15 min at 68°C by constant agitation.
Membranes were autoradiographed after incubation at
37°C for 45 min.

Arsenic and antimony resistance assays
Arsenite and antimonite resistance assays were carried out
in LB medium, while for arsenate resistance, cells were
grown in low phosphate medium. Overnight cultures
were diluted 100-fold into fresh medium containing the
ampicillin and different concentrations of arsenite, antimonite and arsenate. The bacterial suspensions were incubated at 37°C with shaking for 5 hours for experiments in
LB medium or for 15 hours for assays performed in low
phosphate medium and the absorbance at 600 nm was
measured.
RNA isolation and RT-PCR experiments
Total RNA was obtained from mid exponential phase O.
tritici cells grown in low-phosphate medium exposed for
2 h to 1 mM of arsenite, antimonite or arsenate. Control
cells were not exposed to added compounds. Total RNA
isolated from those cells by the Rneasy Mini kit (Qiagen),
according to the manufacturer's instructions, was then
digested with RQ1 Rnase-free DNase (Promega) to
remove the residual DNA. cDNA synthesis was done with
Sensiscript Reverse Transcriptase (Qiagen) according to
the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the reverse prim-

Nucleotide sequence accession numbers
