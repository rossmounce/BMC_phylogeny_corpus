Abstract
Background: Functional genomics has particular promise in silkworm biology for identifying genes
involved in a variety of biological functions that include: synthesis and secretion of silk, sex
determination pathways, insect-pathogen interactions, chorionogenesis, molecular clocks. Wild
silkmoths have hardly been the subject of detailed scientific investigations, owing largely to nonavailability of molecular and genetic data on these species. As a first step, in the present study we
generated large scale expressed sequence tags (EST) in three economically important species of
wild silkmoths. In order to make these resources available for the use of global scientific
community, an EST database called 'WildSilkbase' was developed.
Description: WildSilkbase is a catalogue of ESTs generated from several tissues at different
developmental stages of 3 economically important saturniid silkmoths, an Indian golden silkmoth,
Antheraea assama, an Indian tropical tasar silkmoth, A. mylitta and eri silkmoth, Samia cynthia ricini.
Currently the database is provided with 57,113 ESTs which are clustered and assembled into 4,019
contigs and 10,019 singletons. Data can be browsed and downloaded using a standard web
browser. Users can search the database either by BLAST query, keywords or Gene Ontology
query. There are options to carry out searches for species, tissue and developmental stage specific
ESTs in BLAST page. Other features of the WildSilkbase include cSNP discovery, GO viewer,
homologue finder, SSR finder and links to all other related databases. The WildSilkbase is freely
available from http://www.cdfd.org.in/wildsilkbase/.
Conclusion: A total of 14,038 putative unigenes was identified in 3 species of wild silkmoths.
These genes provide important resources to gain insight into the functional and evolutionary study
of wild silkmoths. We believe that WildSilkbase will be extremely useful for all those researchers
working in the areas of comparative genomics, functional genomics and molecular evolution in
general, and gene discovery, gene organization, transposable elements and genome variability of
insect species in particular.

Background
Sudden spurt in sequencing projects in recent years has
resulted in exponential increase in the genome sequence
repertoire of species that are close relatives of many model
organisms. Availability of the sequence resources has
accelerated comparative genomic analysis and has thus
added to our understanding of organismal biology of
these species. In fact new insights into human genome
have come only after the sequences of related species such
as chimpanzee, monkey and ape were published. However, in the insect order Lepidoptera, which consists of
many economically important insects such as silkmoths,
agriculture pests and beautiful butterflies, only the
domesticated silkworm, Bombyx mori has achieved the distinction of the most well studied insect next only to Drosophila. Therefore, comparative genomics in this order is
still in its infancy.
Functional genomics has particular promise in silkworm
biology for identifying genes involved in synthesis and
secretion of silk, pathways involved in processes such as
insect-pathogen interactions and sex determination
mechanisms. Among lepidopterans, several databases
such as Silkbase [1] for ESTs, Kaikobase [2] for whole
genome sequence, Silkdb [3] for ESTs and whole genome
sequence, and Silksatdb [4] for microsatellites, have been
developed for B. mori. Apart from B. mori, more than
13,000 ESTs have been made available for butterflies
through Butterflybase [5] and 32,217 ESTs for the pest
species, Spodoptera frugiperda through Spodobase [6].
However, wild silkmoths are least represented owing
largely to non-availability of genomic resources in these
species. Hence, generation and utilization of genomic
information from wild lepidopterans will be extremely
useful in understanding these species at molecular level.
The members of family Saturniidae, collectively known as
saturniids, are among the largest and most spectacular of
the Lepidoptera, with an estimated 1,300 to 1,500 different described species distributed worldwide [7]. The Saturniidae family includes the giant silkmoths, royal moths
and emperor moths. The muga silkmoth, Antheraea
assama (n = 15), confined to the North-eastern states of
India, is the least understood and unique species among
saturniid moths. The silk proteins of this species have not
been studied so far despite their unique properties of providing golden lustre to the silk thread. Samia cynthia ricini
(n = 13) a multivoltine silkworm commonly called as 'eri
silkworm' is known for its white or brick-red eri silk. It is
distributed in India, China and Japan. Its ecoraces (~16)
are distributed across the Palaearctic and Indo-Australian
biogeographic regions. The tropical Indian tasar silkmoth,
Antheraea mylitta (n = 31) is a natural fauna of tropical
India, represented by more than 20 well-described, genetically distinct ecoraces. Pursuing genetics and genomics of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/338

saturniids will be of significance for the following reasons:
a) Typical of lepidopterans, B. mori females are heterogametic, with a ZW chromosome constitution; males are ZZ.
Sex chromosomes are considered to be under evolutionary constraints different from those of autosomes. W chromosome is reported to be strongly female determining
[8]. The sex chromosome system of saturniid silkmoth A.
assama, on the other hand, is ZZ/ZO as compared to ZZ/
ZW observed in other silkmoths. Comparative study of
the sex determining genes, would thus reveal diverse sex
determination mechanisms in silkmoths, b) Photoperiod
plays an important role in the life history traits of wild
silkmoths and hence it is important to investigate the
genes involved in circadian rhythm, c) Silk fibres of different wild silkmoths show vast differences in their tenacity,
texture, lustre and many other biophysical properties. In
the light of these, it is interesting to study the genes encoding the silk proteins of wild silkmoths and compare them
with those of mulberry silkmoth, and d) Information on
immune response genes in these species can throw light
on diversity of immune repertoir in these moths and may
lead to identification of novel immune genes.
The rapid and ever increasing deposition of ESTs of various organisms in dbEST database of NCBI shows the role
of EST projects in advancing genomic science in eukaryotes. Considering the potential scientific benefits, in the
current study we generated 57,113 ESTs in three wild silkmoth species, A. assama, S. c. ricini and A. mylitta from different tissues at various developmental stages (Table 1).
These ESTs and resulted unigenes were annotated for
Gene Ontology (GO) terms, simple sequence repeats
(SSRs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). To
get insight into conservation and divergence of genes
among silkmoths and model insects, we compared the
putative unigenes of the three wild silkmoth species
among themselves and with those of four insect species,
B. mori, Drosophila melanogaster, Apis mellifera and Tribolium castaneum. In order to make the EST resources of wild
silkmoths and their annotations available for the use of
scientific community an EST database called 'WildSilkbase' was developed.

Construction and content
EST sequences were generated from 3 wild silkmoth species by sequencing the cDNA clones amplified from
mRNA isolated from several tissues at different developmental stages. All the protocols employed for RNA extraction, cDNA library preparation and EST processing
pipeline are available online in the database and can be
accessed from 'Protocols' section. The ESTs were further
processed with Phred program [9] for base calling DNA
sequence traces. A cut off Phred score of 15 was assigned
to extract quality sequences from chromatograms. In
order to enhance the quality of sequences, ESTs were

screened for presence of vector sequences and subsequently detected vector sequences were then removed
using 'Cross Match' program. EST reads with length less
than 100 bp were discarded. Majority of ESTs included in
the database are having the lengths ranging between
400–600 bp.
To produce non redundant EST dataset for further functional annotation and comparative analysis, 57,113 ESTs
were clustered and assembled through TGICL package
[10] with the CAP3 [11] default options. Based on regions
of similarity, EST sequences were merged into contigs. A
total of 14,038 EST clusters consisting of 4,019 contigs
and 10,019 singletons, putatively regarded as unigenes,
was generated (Table 1). From these unigene sequences,
poly-A tails were trimmed using TrimEST program of
EMBOSS [12]. Trimmed unigene sequences thus obtained
were annotated for GO [13]. The GO annotation is based
on the closest homologues identified by BLAST search

against Seqdblite FASTA sequence flat file [14]. All the
unigenes were assigned a biological process, molecular
function and cellular component using GO database.
ESTs are potential resources for SSR and SNP marker discovery and hence they were screened for SSRs by using
Tandem Repeats Finder (TRF) [15]. For extraction of
repeats, we assigned the following TRF parameters: match
= 2, mismatch = 3, indel = 5, match probability = 0.8,
indel probability = 0.1, minimum score = 25 and maximum period = 10. A. mylitta EST sequence dataset was further analysed for potential SNPs in cDNA sequences
(cSNPs) using SEAN SNP Prediction Program with default
settings [16]. A total of 118 cSNPs was predicted in 1412
EST sequences. These predicted cSNPs, after experimental
validation, will be useful for the analysis of genetic variation and population structure of A. mylitta populations.

Utility and discussion
WildSilkbase is designed to provide a platform for storage
of sequence data and access to annotated information on
ESTs of wild silkmoths. The database has been developed
using MySQL relational database system, and its web
interface has been generated using PHP scripts. It operates
under an Apache web server on a Fedora Linux system.
The data model for raw and processed data of WildSilkbase is shown in Figure 1.
Database can be inspected via four different HTML pages
to allow distinctive queries. The 'Search Options' page
provides three different options namely, Keyword Search,
Homolog Finder and SSR Finder, for searching the database. The 'Keyword Search' gives access to search the database by GO terms, EST clone ID and Unigene ID.
'Homolog Finder' allows end user to search for the homologue of the query sequence against 6 different insect species (Aedes aegypti, Anopheles gambiae, A. mellifera, B. mori,
D. melanogaster and T. castaneum) based on BLAST search.
'SSR Finder' provides access to data on SSRs of wild silkmoth ESTs included in the database. Search results can be
limited by the selection of SSRs of specific type belonging
to a particular species. The output generated is displayed
in a tabulated format (Figure 2).
To categorise transcripts by function, we utilized the GO
classification. The 'GO Viewer' interface is designed to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/338

browse GO terminologies as a tree of terms. The number
next to GO term represents the number of gene products
annotated to that term which are included in the database
and selected in the current view. BLAST [17] search offered
by WildSilkbase allows users to compare any query
sequence against A. assama, S. c. ricini and A. mylitta ESTs
and putative unigene sequence datasets. BLAST search
results are returned directly to the user's web browser in
HTML format (Figure 2). The sequence IDs on the BLAST
result page are further linked to respective sequence information such as organism name, tissue of origin, sequence
length, unigene ID and sequence. A link to ClustalW [18]
alignment file of the sequences matched in the databases
is also provided on the result page.
The 'cSNP' web page provides direct access to cSNPs of A.
mylitta. The results include information such as, contig ID,
contig sequence length, the ESTs included in the contig,
SNP location, alleles and consensus sequence.
The database also provides information on wild silkmoth
biology, cDNA library construction and EST processing
pipeline. The 'Picture Gallery' section has been incorporated in the database to give access to pictures of wild silkmoths. Links to several other databases and resources
related to ESTs and insects are provided on 'Useful Links'
webpage. A 'General Help' page is included for easy and
efficient use of the database. The technical terms occurring

in the database are hyperlinked to the 'Glossary' page for
quick reference. In general, WildSilkbase allows the users
to access all applications. The EST sequences of wild silkmoths are also deposited in NCBI and can be accessed at
the NCBI EST sequence database, dbEST (accession numbers: A. assama; FE952359-FE963860 and FG203277FG226965, A. mylitta; EB742119-EB743530, S. c. ricini;
DC858270-DC878540).
Data analysis
Gene Ontology annotation
GO annotation generates a dynamic controlled vocabulary that can be applied to all organisms, even while
knowledge on genes and proteins in cells is still accumulating. The closest annotated homologue in the GO database was used for assigning these categories. Based on the
GO annotation of the closely related homologues, the
ESTs were assigned a molecular function, biological process and cellular component from the GO database [19].
To accomplish this, the Seqdblite FASTA sequence flat file
was downloaded from the GO database. By running
BLAST against Seqdblite, the closest homologue was iden-

tified. From the BLAST output, molecular functions, biological process and cellular localization were parsed by
building an in-house GO database in MySQL from the
GO-term database flat file, downloaded from GO Database Downloads [20]. The output is graphically represented (Figures 3 and 4).
GO mapping to molecular function revealed that a majority of genes from the tissue transcriptomes of wild silkmoths have almost equal distribution for 'binding'
function (property of binding macro-molecules) and catalytic activity. The next abundant molecular function
observed in the transcriptomes was structural molecule
activity. In case of biological process, majority of the ESTs
belonged to the category of physiological processes and
cellular processes. Based on cellular localization results,
most of the gene products were found to be localized in
cell and synapse part (Figures 3 and 4). Putative unigenes
for each category of GO, of any of the three wild silkmoth
species can be browsed, viewed and downloaded from the
'GO Viewer' option of WildSilkbase.

Comparative genomics
Information on sequence similarity among genomes is a
major resource for finding functional regions and for predicting their functions. Comparison of the genomes of
closely related species is useful for finding the key
sequence differences that may account for the differences

in the organisms. Comparative genomics is thus a powerful and burgeoning discipline and has become more and
more informative as genomic sequence data accumulate
[21]. The lepidopteran insects have taxonomically specific
biological phenomena including sex-determination, pheromone-dependent sexual communication, silk produc-

tion, silk protein organisation, circadian rhythms, insectplant interactions and insect-microbe interactions. Comparing genes of the wild silkmoths with other lepidopterans and other model insect species would shed light on
conservation and divergence of different gene families. In
the present study we compared the putative unigenes of
the three wild silkmoth species between each other and
with the unigenes of four insect species, B. mori, D. melanogaster, A. mellifera and T. castaneum.
The putative unigenes of each of the three wild silkmoth
species were compared among each other using TBLASTX
at the cutoff E-value of 1e-5. The resultant homologs
between each pair and homologs common to all the three
species and unique genes present only in one of the species are represented graphically (Figure 5). Gene comparisons, for example, revealed that A. mylitta has more
number of homologous genes with A. assama than with S.
c. ricini. This is in accordance with the phylogenetic relationship among silkmoth species [22], as both of them
belong to the genera Antheraea.
A total of 9939, 17178, 9747 and 9028 unigene sequences
of B. mori, D. melanogaster, A. mellifera and T. castaneum
respectively, was downloaded from Unigene database of
NCBI [23]. Putative unigenes from each of the three wild
silkmoth species were compared with these four insect
species through TBLASTX search with E-value limit of 1e5. Total number of homologs obtained was plotted on the
graph. In all these comparisons B. mori was found to share
the highest number of homologous genes with all the

wild silkmoth ESTs. We welcome feedback from users for
further improvement of this database. Researchers working on silkmoths are encouraged to submit their wild silkmoth EST data to WildSilkbase, so that it can be made a
single window portal for all information on wild silkmoths. In future, additional features will be added.
Enhanced functional annotation would be mined from
other cluster and pathway databases to make WildSilkbase more user-friendly and to extract maximum information from this database. WildSilkbase, we firmly believe,
will be extremely useful for the researchers working in the
areas of ecology, evolution, functional and comparative
genomics, genetics and biochemistry of insects.
