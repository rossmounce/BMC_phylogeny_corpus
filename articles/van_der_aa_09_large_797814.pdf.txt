Abstract
Background: In mammals, the members of the tripartite motif (TRIM) protein family are involved
in various cellular processes including innate immunity against viral infection. Viruses exert strong
selective pressures on the defense system. Accordingly, antiviral TRIMs have diversified highly
through gene expansion, positive selection and alternative splicing. Characterizing immune TRIMs
in other vertebrates may enlighten their complex evolution.
Results: We describe here a large new subfamily of TRIMs in teleosts, called finTRIMs, identified
in rainbow trout as virus-induced transcripts. FinTRIMs are formed of nearly identical RING/B-box
regions and C-termini of variable length; the long variants include a B30.2 domain. The zebrafish
genome harbors a striking diversity of finTRIMs, with 84 genes distributed in clusters on different
chromosomes. A phylogenetic analysis revealed different subsets suggesting lineage-specific
diversification events. Accordingly, the number of fintrim genes varies greatly among fish species.
Conserved syntenies were observed only for the oldest fintrims. The closest mammalian relatives
are trim16 and trim25, but they are not true orthologs. The B30.2 domain of zebrafish finTRIMs
evolved under strong positive selection. The positions under positive selection are remarkably
congruent in finTRIMs and in mammalian antiviral TRIM5α, concentrated within a viral recognition
motif in mammals. The B30.2 domains most closely related to finTRIM are found among NOD-like
receptors (NLR), indicating that the evolution of TRIMs and NLRs was intertwined by exon
shuffling.
Conclusion: The diversity, evolution, and features of finTRIMs suggest an important role in fish
innate immunity; this would make them the first TRIMs involved in immunity identified outside
mammals.

Background
Newly discovered players in the antiviral immunity field
are the proteins belonging to the tripartite motif (TRIM)
family. The TRIM proteins are characterized by a tripartite
motif that comprises from the N- to C-terminus, a RING
zinc finger domain, one or two B-boxes and a coiled-coil
domain. They are therefore also known as RBCC proteins
[1]. The RING finger and B-box are cysteine-rich domains
and both domains bind zinc atoms, suggesting interaction
with other proteins, RNA and DNA [2-5]. They are usually
encoded as a single exon, and together form the 'RBB'
region. In addition, the RING finger has E3 ubiquitin
ligase activity [6]. The coiled-coil region seems to be predominantly necessary for multimerization, resulting in
the formation of high-molecular weight complexes. In
many TRIM proteins an additional domain is present at
the C-terminus [7], with the B30.2 domain being the most
frequent one (reviewed in [8]). The B30.2 domain is
encoded by one exon [9,10]. The domain is also found in
butyrophilin and stonustoxin [11] and has evolved by a
relatively recent juxtaposition of the PRY domain and the
SPRY domain; it is therefore also known as the PRY/SPRY
domain [12]. The B30.2 domain has been shown to be
essential for ligand binding in several TRIM proteins [1315]. Its tertiary structure has recently been elucidated for
TRIM21, revealing two binding pockets formed by six variable loops [16]. Since the order and spacing of the
domains are highly conserved, a TRIM protein presumably acts as an integrated structure [1]. TRIM proteins are
evolutionarily old proteins that can be found in primitive
metazoans [6]. Currently, 68 TRIM-encoding genes have
been described in human [1,7,8,17]. Most TRIM genes
code for at least two isoforms that are generated by alternative splicing, resulting in full-length and partial transcripts that lack the C-terminal encoding sequence.
The TRIM proteins play multiple roles in various cellular
processes, which include cell growth, differentiation and
apoptosis in mammals. Many TRIM genes are proto-oncogenes and severe diseases such as Opitz syndrome and
acute promyelocytic leukemia are caused by mutations in
trim18 and trim19, respectively [18], reviewed in [19]. An
antiviral activity has also been described for several TRIM
proteins: TRIM1, -5α, -11, -15, -19, -22, -25, -28 -32 [8,2022]. These TRIM proteins can block viral infection by different mechanisms, as revealed by the functional characterization of TRIM5α, TRIM19 and TRIM25. A virusspecific interaction has been described for TRIM5α and
TRIM19. TRIM5α was initially identified in rhesus
macaques as the protein responsible for post-entry restriction of HIV-1 in this species, while its human ortholog
could not block HIV-1 [23]. TRIM5α forms trimers that
bind the nucleocapsid of incoming viral particles through
a C-terminal B30.2 domain, which accelerates the uncoating of the viral core and thereby interferes with the reverse

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/7

transcription [24,25]. Among primates, this domain contains four hypervariable regions that have been subjected
to a virus-driven diversification and account for the species-dependent retrovirus restriction of TRIM5α [26-28].
The RING and B-box domains of TRIM5α are essential for
localizing TRIM5α in specific cytoplasmic 'bodies' and
may also be involved in inhibiting the assembly of progeny virions [6,29-31]. The antiviral restriction activity of
TRIM19, or promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein has
been demonstrated for retroviruses (HFV, HIV, MLV), but
also for an arenavirus (lymphocytic choriomeningitis
virus), a rhabdovirus (VSV) and an orthomyxovirus
(influenza A) [8,32]. For example, TRIM19/PML binds the
HFV Tas protein, a transactivator for HFV transcription,
preventing binding of Tas protein to the viral genome and
thereby transcription of viral open-reading frames (ORFs)
[33]. As expected for proteins involved in antiviral
defenses, several TRIM proteins are induced by interferon
[34-37], but they can also participate in the induction of
interferon synthesis. Thus, TRIM25 is involved in the production of IFN-β through the RIG1-pathway [20].
Here, we characterize a new subset of trim genes that were
originally discovered in a screen for virus-induced genes
expressed by fish [38], and named them fintrim for fish
novel Trim. The fintrim genes constitute a unique expansion of trim genes in different teleost species, with up to 84
genes identified in zebrafish (Danio rerio). In the
zebrafish, these genes are located on several chromosomes, with three main clusters on the chromosome 2.
The ORFs of this multigene family are highly similar in
sequence, but variable in length. The most extended proteins contain a RING finger, two B-boxes, a coiled-coil
region and a B30.2 domain. Interestingly, the finTRIM
B30.2 domains have evolved under diversifying selection,
and are closely related to B30.2 domains present in a
NOD-like receptor (NLR) subfamily unique to teleost fish
[39,40]. The characterization of the finTRIM subset highlights the evolutionary dynamics of the TRIM family and
strongly advocates a role in the innate antiviral response
of fish.

Results
finTRIM, a new group of TRIM proteins induced by viruses
in rainbow trout
In order to identify virus-induced transcripts in fish leukocytes, we previously used the method of subtractive suppressive hybridization on rainbow trout leukocytes that
were either incubated with viral hemorrhagic septicemia
virus (VHSV) or mock-infected. This approach identified
24 virus-induced sequences [38]. One of them (clone
[Genbank:AF483536]) contained a 200 aa ORF with a
RING finger and two B-box motifs, resulting in a RBB
domain typical of TRIM proteins. No coiled-coil region
could be found in this sequence. A naive trout spleen

cDNA library was then screened to confirm the structure
of this TRIM cDNA and we identified two other full-length
and
sequences
(clones
[Genbank:AM887799
AM887838]). These sequences contained a RBB region
almost identical to that of the AF483536 clone (96%
identity over 200 residues), associated with a coiled-coil
region. In addition, the clone AM887799 contained a Cterminal B30.2 domain (Figure 1A). A multiple alignment
of these sequences suggested that they did not result from
alternative splicing of the same gene. Taken together,
these results already suggested that these trims belong to a
multigenic family with a modular structure. We could not
find any obvious counterpart of these trims in sequence
databases from mammals or other tetrapods. We thus
assumed that they may belong to a new subfamily, and
named them fintrims.
The induction of finTRIM transcripts by the virus was further confirmed using real-time quantitative PCR (Figure
1B) using primers B144f/r located in the RBB region and
matching the three clones (and in fact all trout finTRIMs;
see Figure 1A for primer location). The induction ratio
measured by this real-time PCR therefore corresponded to
an average value, and may conceal disparities of the
induction level for different genes. An induction ratio
higher than 10 was measured after the viral infection in
leukocytes or poly(I:C) treatment in fibroblasts, while no
induction was noted in leukocytes after incubation with
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from E. coli. In LPS-treated leukocytes, IFNγ transcript was induced 7-fold (range 5.8 to
8.4), demonstrating an effective stimulation. These experiments established that at least some finTRIMs are
induced by viral infection.
To characterize further the diversity of the finTRIMs, we
performed a 3'RACE PCR on VHSV-induced leukocyte
cDNA using a universal primer specific for trout finTRIM
localized in the highly conserved region in the vicinity of
the start codon. These experiments on infected leukocytes
revealed a rich profile of amplified bands, which suggested that finTRIM sequences are highly diverse (Figure
1C). A diverse profile was also observed in the absence of
infection, but the signal appeared weaker and the profile
less complex. To investigate finTRIM expression in a nonlymphoid cell type, similar 3'RACE PCR experiments were
performed on the fibroblast cell line RTG2. Poly(I:C) was
used to mimic viral infection, since VHSV replicates in
these cells and kills them quickly, in contrast to leukocytes. Almost no expression of finTRIMs could be detected
in untreated fibroblasts, while a number of bands
appeared after poly(I:C) stimulation (Figure 1D). This
profile was less diverse than in leukocytes, with a bias
towards long transcripts. This observation indicated that
different arrays of finTRIMs are expressed in different
cells, and corroborated the notion that some forms are
inducible by viral infection.

The rainbow trout finTRIM transcripts are highly diverse
To further characterize the finTRIM diversity and to assess
the specificity of the 3'RACE PCR amplification, we
cloned the PCR products and sequenced clones picked at
random. Fifty-four clones from leukocytes and 16 clones
from RTG2 cells were completely sequenced. All clones
contained a finTRIM sequence, confirming the high specificity of the amplification. The size of finTRIM transcripts was highly diverse, as expected from the 3'RACE
profile. Different C-terminal regions of variable length
were associated with the N-terminal RBB region shared by
all sequences. For some clones, the C-terminus was
encoded by short unique sequences unrelated to the
longer ones. Based on their length or on the motifs
present in the C-terminus, we classified the deduced
finTRIM proteins into five different groups (Figure 1E). In
fact, although the N-terminal RING/B-box regions of the
different finTRIM sequences were highly similar to each
other, they were not identical due to single nucleotide
substitutions. These substitutions were more frequent
than the error frequency due to PCR and sequencing (2 to
5%), and most of them were restricted to a number of
conserved sites, which indicates that they did not correspond to artifacts. Therefore, the finTRIM diversity could
not be due to alternative splicing of a unique RBB exon to
multiple and diverse C-terminal exons. Moreover, the different sequences from leukocyte cDNAs were derived
from a homozygous rainbow trout (see Methods), and
therefore represent many different genes and not allelic
diversity. Taken together, these observations suggest that
rainbow trout finTRIMs are encoded by a large number of
different genes.
The fintrim genes are highly diverse in zebrafish where
they constitute a multigenic family
In order to extend the generality of our findings, we
searched for fintrim genes in another teleost, the zebrafish
Danio rerio. Tblastn searches were made on the most
recent zebrafish genome assembly (zv7), using as query
the trout protein sequence AF483536 containing a RING
and two B-box motifs. A set of more than 100 significant
hits was obtained. More than half of them, associated
with the most significant E values, were more similar to
the trout fintrims than to any other described trim gene.
Unexpectedly, among low-ranking hits, we also found
many genes with sequences most similar to bloodthirsty
(bty), a known zebrafish trim gene with a B30.2 domain,
involved in erythrocyte differentiation and closely related
to human trim39 [41]. This observation was in accordance
with a recent survey of vertebrate TRIM sequences reporting a high diversity of TRIM sequences in the fish genome
[17].

As a consequence of our search criteria, all these hits corresponded to N-terminal RBB exons (truncated in three of
them). We extended our search by looking for B30.2

domain-encoding exons in the downstream genomic
sequence and found one in most cases (>80%). Several
genes appeared to be likely pseudogenes, either because of
early frameshifts (allelic in some cases, see below), or
absence of an identifiable start or stop codon. However, in
several instances this may be due to a genome assembly
defect or to unusual gene structure with extra undetected
exon(s) upstream of the RBB or downstream of the B30.2.
The deduced protein sequences were aligned and similarity trees were established (Additional file 1 – Figure S1).
The trees obtained with the RBB domains and with the
B30.2 domains were highly congruent and allowed us to
define two families: one that contained 84 fintrim genes
(hereafter named ftr01 to ftr84) and one that contained 33
bloodthirsty-related genes (named btr01 to btr33). Three
subgroups, based on apparent phylogenetic age, were
defined among the fintrim family. The major subgroup
(Group A), which includes 65 genes (ftr01 to ftr65), represents the 'crown group', which appears to have evolved
most recently. Group B, including 17 genes (ftr66 to ftr81)
is not monophyletic, and contains genes that appear to
have diverged at around the time that the clade that now
includes the zebrafish separated from the main teleost lineage. Finally, group C consists of only three genes (ftr82,
ftr83, and ftr84), which seem to be the most ancient ones.
Within each subgroup, genes were named according to
their genomic position. Because the zebrafish genome
assembly Zv7 is still imperfect, a few difficulties appeared
with the annotation. For instance, the bty gene itself was
not found in zv7 (bty has been mapped to a relatively telomeric position on chromosome 19 [41], and therefore
may reside within the same cluster as btr18, its closest relative among our dataset). An inverted duplication on
chromosome 23 results in the presence of twins (in coding as well as in intronic sequences) for the closely linked
ftr58 and ftr59 genes, which we named ftr58dupli and
ftr59dupli. An assembly gap just downstream of the ftr20
gene is probably responsible for its lack of a B30.2-containing exon. Finally, contigs containing four genes (ftr64,

ftr65, ftr80, and ftr81) are not yet assigned to a given chromosome.
The genomic distribution of all ftr and btr genes is shown
in Figure 2: detailed positions are given in Additional file
2 – Table S1. As can be readily observed, most of these
genes are arranged in clusters of genes in the same orientation. Half of the ftr genes are localized on chromosome
2, with three major clusters. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that genes within a cluster are more related to each
other than to genes in other clusters.
In addition to the long and readily detectable exons
encoding the N-terminal RBB and C-terminal B30.2
domains, middle exons could be predicted for the majority of genes, with the help of our subsequent RACE analysis (see below) and with GNOMON-predicted sequences
deposited in Genbank. For ftr genes, organization was
very well conserved, with a first RBB-encoding exon of
555 to 594 (coding) bp, two 96 and 234-bp long exons
encoding the coiled-coils, two 154 and 60-bp long exons
with no clear domain associated, and a final ~545 coding
bp exon encoding the B30.2 domain.
To gain an insight into the expression pattern of zebrafish
fintrim genes, we designed consensus primers to perform
3'RACE-PCR simultaneously on all members of group A,
the largest but also most homogeneous group. RACE-PCR
products from zebrafish larvae were cloned and more
than 70 clones were sequenced to obtain an approximate
image of the relative fintrim expression in different settings of virus-induced activation. We tested three different
stimuli: IFN1 over-expression, and experimental infection
with either Spring Viremia of Carp Virus (SVCV) or a heatadapted variant of Infectious Hematopoietic Necrosis
Virus (IHNV). Results are summarized in Figure 3 and
Table 1. Given the very high number of zebrafish ftr genes
in group A, it would be difficult to get a statistically significant picture of the expression of any single gene, but the

Variants3 zebrafish finTRIM ORFs
Variants of zebrafish finTRIM ORFs. Schematic representation of the zebrafish expressed ftr sequences from group A.
Protein sequences were predicted from 3'RACE clones that included a polyA tail. Since the consensus RACE primer was
designed in the coding region (in the RING region), the N-termini of the proteins was extrapolated from the corresponding
genomic sequences in zv7. Colors of protein domains are as in Figure 1 (plus the grey box representing a chromodomain).

aggregated data reveal interesting trends. At the developmental stage examined (72 to 96 hours post fertilization),
expression was restricted, or at least highly skewed,
towards a subset of genes, most of them on chromosome
2. Genes frequently found in control samples were also
expressed in stimulated samples. Some genes, such as
ftr02, ftr23 and ftr64, were detected only in stimulated
samples. Short and long finTRIM proteins were expressed
with or without B30.2 domain, in a striking parallel to
what we have found in the trout. Viral or IFN-stimulation
did not affect the overall pattern of length distribution,
perhaps because RNA was extracted from whole larvae,
which may dilute the specific response. Remarkably, alternative splicing did not account for all the diversity in pro-

tein size; allelic variation also played a prominent role
(note that standard laboratory zebrafish are not inbred,
and that pools of larvae were used). For instance, two different groups of ftr39 transcripts were found, some coding
for canonical, full-length finTRIM proteins, while others,
similar in this respect to the allele of the zv7 genome
assembly, contain a 2 bp-deletion in the first exon, resulting in a transcript coding for a truncated protein with only
a RING domain, irrespective of subsequent splicing.
The finTRIM family is present in many teleost fish but
shows various levels of diversity
Systematic searches were performed in other available fish
genome databases: medaka (Oryzias latipes), stickleback

Group A finTRIM genes expressed in zebrafish embryos, as deduced from 3'RACE. Control embryos were either 72 hpf non-manipulated embryos
(four sequences); 72 hpf, mcherry-transduced embryos (six sequences); 78 hpf non-manipulated embryos (10 sequences) or 96 hpf non-manipulated
embryos (12 sequences). Stimulated embryos were either 72 hpf, zIFN1-transduced embryos (10 sequences); 78 hpf, SVCV-infected embryos (five
sequences); or 96 hpf, IHNV-infected embryos (20 sequences). Multiple occurrences of ftr in different classes correspond either to allelic (*) or to
splicing variants. Protein isoforms were classified according to Figure 3. Accession numbers [GenBank:AM941305–AM941371].

(Gasterosteus aculeatus) and pufferfish (Tetraodon nigroviridis), with tblastn and blastp using the trout and
zebrafish conserved N-terminus of finTRIM as bait (Additional file 3 – Table S2). When highly similar hits were
found, other finTRIM exons were searched close by, and
the predicted sequences were subjected to multiple alignment with trout and zebrafish finTRIMs (Figure 4A). We
checked that these sequences retrieved zebrafish finTRIMs
or allies when used as a query in the reciprocal blast
searches. In medaka, this approach revealed a large
number of close fintrim homologs, as in zebrafish. The significant hits are mainly clustered on chromosomes 17 (29
hits, including 19 in the same region) and 18 (15 hits). A
few genes are also dispersed on other chromosomes (1, 2,
5, 6, 14, 15, 21 and 24). In addition, 24 hits were found
which were unanchored to the assembly. Interestingly, the
whole ORF is encoded by one exon for most of these hits
(47 genes among 55), in contrast to the zebrafish. These
intronless genes correspond most probably to retrotransposed genes.
In the pufferfish, the best hit is localized on chromosome
14, and additional homologs are found on chromosomes
7, 9, 17, 18 and 3 (nine hits in total), or among the unanchored sequences.
In the stickleback genome, at least four genes located in
the same region of linkage group (LG) III and three genes

in LG VII showed high similarity with trout and zebrafish
fintrims. A fintrim-encoding EST ([GenBank:BM424798])
was also identified in the channel catfish. Taken together,
these observations suggested that fintrim genes constitute
a multigenic family in all teleost genomes, with a highly
variable number of genes (less than 10 to more than 80
genes).
The fintrims do not possess obvious orthologs in higher
vertebrates
We used fish sequences of finTRIM RBB or B30.2 domains
with the tblastn program to search for their mammalian
homologs in Genbank or genome databases. Both RBB
and B30.2 regions from finTRIM sequences and the
related sequences found in tetrapods were then subjected
to phylogenetic analysis using NJ or parsimony methods,
which produced congruent phylogenetic trees. This analysis revealed that the fintrims do not possess direct
orthologs in mammals or in other tetrapods (Figure 4B
and 4C). The mammalian proteins most similar to
finTRIMs were TRIM16 and TRIM25. However, reciprocal
blast queries, using mammalian TRIM25 sequences, identified in the zebrafish genome one single gene
(gb#AY648763) more similar to trim25 than to fintrims; a
relative of this gene was also identified in trout and
salmon. Similar queries with mammalian TRIM16
retrieved yet another gene (gb#BC155346). In contrast,
no mammalian sequence appeared as a finTRIM ortholog.

Orthologs of finTRIMs could not be found in chicken or
Xenopus either, and therefore seem to be absent from tetrapods.
The phylogenetic analysis showed that finTRIMs
sequences from different teleosts grouped in a separate
branch supported by high bootstrap values in phylogenetic trees generated by either neighbor-joining (NJ) or
parsimony methods for both RBB and B30.2 regions (Figure 4B and 4C). FinTRIMs therefore appear as a teleostspecific subset. In contrast, TRIM16-like and TRIM25-like
sequences from fish or clawed frog grouped with their
mammalian counterparts, identifying these trim genes as
fish orthologs of mammalian trim16 and trim25. Interestingly, in the elephant shark genome, no finTRIM counterpart could be found, while sequences highly similar to
TRIM16 and 25 were present (trim16: AAVX01048456;
trim25: AAVX01256120; intermediate trim16/trim25:
AAVX01115558,
available
at
http://esharkge
nome.imcb.a-star.edu.sg/). Although this database is still
incomplete and shark trim16/25-related sequences were
partial, these observations reinforce the notion that trim16
and trim25 are ancient genes while fintrims appeared and
expanded in the teleost fish.
In addition, since bty has been described as the counterpart of trim39, we investigated the phylogenetic relationships of the btr subgroup and tetrapod trim39 with trim16,
trim25 and fintrims. Members of the btr subfamily (including bty) were indeed most similar to tetrapod trim39, and
reciprocally; they also clustered together in the B30.2based tree (Figure 4C).
Conserved syntenies between teleost fish and tetrapods for
fintrim-related genes
To further investigate the origin of finTRIMs, conserved
markers in the vicinity of tetraodon, stickleback or
zebrafish ftr clusters were identified and used to search for
conserved syntenies in other genomes. No clear conserved
synteny could be identified between the regions encoding
group A or group B finTRIMs in different teleosts, suggesting that fintrim genes were subjected to genus or speciesspecific duplication and expansion episodes during the
evolution of teleosts.

In contrast, we could identify a conserved synteny
between regions comprising the 'ancient' (group C) ftr82
and ftr83 genes associated with the markers INTS2, RSPS6,
ATP5L, RUVBL2 and SPSN2 in zebrafish, medaka, and
stickleback (Figure 5). Conserved syntenies were also
observed for markers flanking trim16 and trim25 in these
three species, supporting the hypothesis that these genes
are older and kept in a more stable genomic configuration
than recent fintrims.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/7

Interestingly, the orthologs of all the markers involved in
these conserved synteny groups (ftr82/83, trim25, trim16)
in teleosts were located on the same human chromosome
17, distributed over 70 megabases (Figure 5). In addition,
they were also retrieved on mouse chromosome 11 and
on the chicken mini chromosomes 18 and 19 that correspond to large regions of the human chromosome 17.
Taken together, these observations in teleosts and tetrapods suggest that the genomic configuration of trim16 or
trim25 (as opposed to fintrim genes) cannot be explained
by recent sporadic events that occurred in particular species. They rather suggest that the regions containing the
ancestral trim16 and trim25 moved apart in the early fish
evolution and were kept as synteny groups on two different chromosomes while most fintrims appeared and differentiated by multiple duplications in the fish lineages.
The situation is more complex for group C ftrs 82/83 (see
Discussion).
The zebrafish finTRIM proteins have evolved under
positive selection
To gain further insight into the meaning of finTRIM
sequence variability, we analyzed the pattern of variable
positions, in the context of the tertiary structure of the
B30.2 domain that has been determined for human
TRIM21 [16,42]. The B30.2 domain forms a distorted βsandwich of two antiparallel β-sheets, made up by the
PRY and SPRY subdomains [16,42,43]. The β-strands are
connected by six variable loops that define regions of
hypervariability and form the ligand-binding surface in
TRIM5α and TRIM21. We determined variability in
finTRIM B30.2 by performing two multiple alignments of
both trout finTRIM B30.2 and zebrafish finTRIM group A
B30.2 sequences (see Additional file 4 – Figure S2) and
determined site-by-site variation. We then aligned the
B30.2 domains of trout and zebrafish finTRIM with
human TRIM5α and TRIM21 (Figure 6). The trout
finTRIM B30.2 sequences are rather conserved and the
majority of variable sites, 23 of 29, are located in the
regions that correspond with the variable loops of
TRIM21. Fifteen variable sites of trout correspond with
regions that are hypervariable in primate TRIM5α. The
zebrafish finTRIM B30.2 sequences are even less conserved with 78 variable sites that are also associated with
the predicted variable loops of TRIM21 or with the hypervariable regions of TRIM5α, albeit more loosely.

For primate TRIM5α it has been demonstrated that the
B30.2 domain has evolved under diversifying selection
pressure, with the positively selected sites predominantly
located in the four regions that are hypervariable among
primate TRIM5α [27,44]. We investigated whether the
zebrafish fintrim genes have also evolved under diversifying selection. We used a test that is based on the estima-

of all codons among a set of sequences. The ratio ω = dN/
dS is an indication for negative selection (ω < 1), neutral
evolution (ω = 1), or positive selection (ω >1). If an amino
acid change is neutral, it will be fixed at the same rate as a

synonymous mutation, and ω = 1. If the amino acid
change is deleterious, purifying (negative) selection will
reduce its fixation rate, thus ω < 1. An amino acid change
is fixed at a higher rate than a synonymous mutation (ω
>1) only when it offers a selective advantage. The site-specific model within the Phylogeny Analysis by Maximum

Likelihood (PAML) software package allows heterogeneity in evolutionary pressure along a protein encoding
sequence and can identify the specific sites that are under
positive selection. Two models of substitution distribution, M2a and M8, can be used to test the positive selection hypothesis against the nested null models: M2a
against M1a and M8 against M7.

We took the complete sequences of zebrafish finTRIM
group A B30.2 domains and analyzed them with the
PAML models M1a, M2a, M7 and M8. A value of ω >1 was
detected for 15.6% of sites under M2a and 17.6% of sites
under M8 (see Table 2). The likelihood-ratio test (LRT)
was significant with p < 0.001 for both models (see Table
3). The estimation of substitution rates by PAML is based

on branch lengths of sequences in the phylogenetic tree.
As a result of recombination, sites within one sequence
are no longer similar in branch length and this can interfere with the results of PAML since this model assumes
that all sites within a sequence are similar in branch
length. To investigate whether the detection of positive
selection was not perturbed by recombination, we implemented the algorithm PARRIS on our dataset. With the
PARRIS program, a partitioning approach is used and siteto-site variation in both synonymous and non-synonymous rates is integrated in the M1a and M2a models. We
analyzed the zebrafish finTRIM group A B30.2 sequences
with PARRIS and could still detect positive selection by
the LTR with p < 0.001, indicating that whether or not
recombination did occur, the B30.2 has evolved under
positive selection. To search for recombination sites, we
employed the program GARD. The algorithm subdivides
the sequence alignment in putative non-recombinant
fragments, phylogenies are inferred for each fragment and
the goodness of fit is assessed by Akaike's information criterium (c-AIC), predicting whether or not the fragments
are derived from two different ancestor sequences due to
recombination. We searched for either two or up to 20
breakage points and could identify one breakage point by

both searches, with Δc-AIC = 42.96 under the two-breakage-point model and Δc-AIC = 28.67 under the 20-breakage-point model (see Additional file 5 – Table S3).
We re-analyzed our zebrafish finTRIM group A dataset of
B30.2 by subdividing the alignment in two parts, containing the sequence regions before or after the detected
recombination point. For both regions, we detected positive selection, with p < 0.001 in the LRT under M1a-M2a
and M7–M8 models (see Table 2 and Table 3). The specific sites under positive selection according to the models
2a and 8 were identified by a Bayesian approach. For the
B30.2 domain we were able to identify 16 sites under both
model 2a and 17 under model 8. Fourteen sites were
located in regions corresponding to the predicted variable
loops of TRIM21. In addition, the majority of the sites
were located within the regions corresponding with the
four hypervariable regions described for TRIM5α, with six
sites falling in the hypervariable region 1, one in region 2
and six in region 3. (See Figure 6 for positions of sites and
Additional file 6 – Table S4 for posterior probabilities).
We used a similar approach to detect positive selective
sites in the RING and two B-box domains. First we ana-

lyzed with PAML the complete dataset from all RING-Bbox sequences from zebrafish finTRIM group A. Positive
selection was detected for 6.3% of sites under M2a and
7.1% of sites under M8 with p < 0.001 in the LTR of both
M1a-M2a and M7–M8. With PARRIS we confirmed that
the RBB has evolved under positive selection with p <
0.001 in the LTR of M1a-M2a. We used GARD to search
for recombination and we also identified a breakage
point, with a significant value of Δc-AIC = 254.63 under
the two-breakage-point model and Δc-AIC = 263.22
under the 20-breakage-point model. We therefore divided
the RBB multiple alignment into two segments and reanalyzed the sequences located before and after the breakage site using PAML. For the sequences located before the
predicted breakage point we found three sites under positive selection under M2a and under M8, with p < 0.001 in
the LTR under both nested models. These sites are located
just upstream of the RING motif. For the region after the
breakage point, the test for positive selection was no
longer significant, with p = 0.155 in the LTR of M1a-M2a
and p = 0.455 in the LRT of M7–M8, (see Table 2).
Taken together, these results firmly establish that the
loops of the zebrafish Group A finTRIM B30.2 domains
have been diversified under positive selection, as previously described for the sites determining virus specificity
in TRIM5α, suggesting a selective pressure on this domain
for binding to diverse ligands. A few positions located

close to the RING motif are also subjected to diversification.
Exon shuffling of B30.2 domain occurred between
finTRIMs and NLR
Since finTRIM B30.2 features suggest that they may be
involved in interactions with diverse ligands, similar
B30.2 domains may be used in other TRIM subfamilies for
comparable purposes. We therefore searched the zebrafish
genome for sequences closely related to typical finTRIM
B30.2 domains. Unexpectedly, the closest counterparts of
finTRIM B30.2 sequences were not found in other TRIM,
but were associated with NACHT and leucine-rich repeats
(LRRs)-ribonuclease inhibitor (RI)-like motifs in NLR
proteins (Figure 7A). These proteins, which possess a
B30.2 and a NACHT domain and are very likely involved
in innate immunity, have been identified very recently;
such a combination is not found in mammals [40]. While
the protein sequences of B30.2 from Group A ftrs were
about 40% similar to B30.2 domains from close TRIM relatives such as bloodthirsty or TRIM25, they were 55 to
65% similar to B30.2 from these NLR proteins, and about
50 to 55% similar to those of the Group B or C ftr
sequences (Figure 7B). A phylogenetic analysis showed
that B30.2 sequences of group A finTRIM and a subgroup
of NLR (named here group 1) are joined as a cluster supported by a high bootstrap value (Figure 7C). This cluster
is quite distinct from that of other TRIMs, including group
B or group C ftr and btr, or even from the rest of B30.2bearing NLRs (group 2), suggesting an exon shuffling
event between group A fintrims and group1 NLRs.

Discussion
We have described here a large set of closely related genes
and transcripts that contain the three motifs typical of
TRIM proteins, namely the RING zinc finger, two B-boxes
and a predicted coiled-coil region. Their close relatedness
allowed us to group these sequences in one multigene
family, the finTRIMs. The fintrim genes were identified in
all teleost fish species for which a genome database is
available. In addition, we characterized a number of transcripts in rainbow trout and zebrafish, confirming that
these genes are actively transcribed. Although the gene
numbers vary among the different teleost species, the
wide distribution of the fintrim genes suggests an important role, one in which diversity offers a selective advantage to the host. Since finTRIMs are specifically induced by
viruses and poly(I:C), they probably play a role in antiviral immunity, as several other TRIMs do in mammals.
FinTRIM diversity suggests that they recognize multiple
ligands
The highly diverse finTRIMs are encoded by a large
number of genes. This TRIM subset is a teleost-specific
group, well distinct from other TRIMs shared by fish and

mammals as TRIM16, TRIM25, TRIM39 and others. Next
to the variety generated by the large number of genes, we
demonstrate here that the B30.2 domain of fintrim genes
has evolved under diversifying selective forces. This indicates that these proteins bind a diverse range of ligands,
making an immune function very plausible. Consistent
with a role in immune recognition, our current data suggest that there is a high allelic polymorphism among
zebrafish fintrim genes. There are numerous examples of
large polymorphic multigene families that are involved in
innate immunity. The proteins they encode either recognize a variety of microbial patterns, or bind diverse receptors of the host immune system and participate in the
tuning of complex activation pathways. Such receptors
include some mammalian TRIMs [45-47], but also the
mammalian killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors
(KIR) [48] and Ly-49 related proteins [49], chicken Ig-like
receptor (CHIR) [50,51], fish novel immune-type receptors (NITR) [52,53], fish leukocyte immune-type receptors (LITR) [54], and sea urchin toll-like receptors [55].
If finTRIMs are specifically involved in virus recognition
or act as virus-restricting molecules, the high number of
fintrim genes opens the possibility for parallel and simultaneous selection by different viruses [46].
Signatures of positively selected residues in finTRIM B30.2
equate with canonical motifs of the virus-binding sites in
TRIM5
The finTRIM B30.2 domain contributes dominantly to
finTRIM diversity, and seems to be generally similar in
structure to the B30.2 domain of TRIM21. Among the
sequences of the multiple finTRIMs described in both
trout and zebrafish, the variable sites are predominantly
located in the variable loops of the domain, in a way that
strongly suggests that the B30.2 domains interacts with
their ligands as TRIM5α does for viral proteins. In particular, the sites identified in zebrafish as subjected to significant diversifying ('positive') selection were concentrated
in the variable loop 1, between the β-strands 2 and 3. This
loop was earlier designated as a 'hotspot' region, since
sites within this region determine the lentivirus restriction-specificity of TRIM5α and mutations in this region
are correlated with the disease susceptibility associated
with TRIM20 (familial Mediterranean fever) and TRIM21
(an autoantigen in multiple diseases) [16]. Such a distribution of sites diversified under positive selection in the
loop 1 (loop β2–3) of the B30.2 domain strongly supports both the reality of a diversifying selection and the
diversity of ftr B30.2 ligands.

In addition, we also found several sites under diversifying
selection within the RBB domain, suggesting that additional sites may also be involved in binding of a(nother)
ligand. A few sites were earlier shown to have evolved

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/7

under diversifying selection in the coiled-coil region of
proteins TRIM5α and TRIM22 [44], but positive selection
of RING and B-box domains was not reported. Besides,
the roles of the RING and B-box domains in TRIM function are still not fully understood, although deletion or
mutations can abrogate the activity of TRIM5α, and the
significance of the positively selected RBB residues in ftrs
remains therefore elusive. In this context, one may also
question the function of the finTRIM genes that do not
contain a B30.2 domain (one out of five in the zebrafish,
but probably more in trout). It is tempting to consider
them as potential inhibitors/regulators of an antiviral
response triggered by B30.2-containing genes.
The evolutionary affinities of finTRIM B30.2 domains
suggest a domain shuffling between NLR and TRIM
molecules
An interesting finding was the close relationship of
finTRIM B30.2 domains with the B30.2 domains present
in a subset of NLR proteins recently described in the
zebrafish. NLR proteins, also known as CATERPILLER,
NACHT or NOD-LRR proteins, are large cytoplasmic proteins involved in inflammation and apoptosis. They are
characterized by a NACHT domain and a leucine-rich
repeat (LRR) region at the C-terminus and vary in their Nterminal effector domain, which is a CARD, pyrin or TIR
domain. As for TRIM proteins, the physiological functions
of NLRs are diverse, and several NLRs are inhibitors/activators of the inflammatory and immune responses. For
example, NALP3/cryopyrin is a key component of the
inflammasome and inhibits TNF- and TRAF6- induced
NFκB activation [56], while NOD2 plays a role in NFκB
activation [57]. Large groups of novel, fish-specific NLR
proteins have been recently described in fish and appear
to be highly related within each species, indicating recent
species-specific expansions [39]. Some of these teleost
NLR proteins contain the NACHT and LRR domains at the
C-terminus in combination with a B30.2 domains, as the
NLR-C described in [40]. The close relatedness of these
B30.2 domains to the group A finTRIM B30.2 domain
suggests that the corresponding exon(s) have been subjected to shuffling between NLR and group A finTRIM,
that is, during ftr evolution (Figure 8). The exchange of a
ligand-recognition module evolving under positive selection with another protein family mainly involved in
inflammation, immune regulation and possibly pathogen
sensing constitutes another argument supporting an
immune function for group A finTRIMs.
Phylogenetic analyses suggest that ftr appeared and
diversified during the teleost evolution while trim16/25/39
are more ancient genes common to all vertebrates
The fintrims and their relatives (trim25, trim16, trim39) followed different evolutionary pathways (Figure 8). Both
teleosts and mammals possess single orthologous trim25

Tentative evolutionary pathway of fintrims and their relatives in vertebrates
Figure 8
Tentative evolutionary pathway of fintrims and their relatives in vertebrates. The genes identified in the genomes of
different vertebrate groups are indicated on the right. Since the current draft of the elephant shark genome is still partial, the

and trim16, as evidenced by phylogenetic analysis and
conserved synteny. Sequences coding for partial trim16
and trim25 were also identified in the elephant shark
genome, confirming that these genes were already present
in the early vertebrates. In contrast, fintrims seem to be
unique to teleost fish and could not be found in any other
group of animals. Since they were present in all fish for
which a significant amount of genomic data was available, fintrims most probably appeared during the early evolution of teleosts. While they are represented by large gene
sets in zebrafish, salmonids and medaka, several fish species such as fugu or stickleback only possess a few copies
of fintrim genes. Thus, fintrim genes have been probably
subjected to parallel – and independent – duplication
events in the different branches of teleosts. This hypothesis is strengthened by the fact that zebrafish ftr genes were
generally most similar to their immediate neighbors, suggesting tandem duplication within clusters rather than en

bloc duplication as the main gene amplification mechanism.
This view is supported by the absence of obvious synteny
between the regions encoding almost all finTRIMs in different teleosts. Also, diverse mechanisms of gene spreading appear to have been used in different species, since
many medaka fintrims are intronless in contrast to
zebrafish ftr, suggesting that one or more retro-transposition events have been involved in the multiplication of
these sequences. This observation is a good argument for
a fast expansion in this species, and reinforces the idea of
strong selection pressures towards finTRIM diversification. Such selection pressures exerted by species- or family-specific viruses are expected to be highly variable
between different fish taxa. Whether another TRIM set
constrains or balances the evolution of finTRIMs, as
described for anti-retroviral TRIM5α and TRIM22 [44],

remains to be established. Also, the B30.2 exon shuffling
has complicated the fintrim evolutionary pathway.
finTRIM Group C is closest to other TRIMs in the phylogenetic trees, suggesting that they appeared during the early
evolution of teleosts. They are present in the different fish
investigated so far but no counterpart was found in other
vertebrates. Interestingly, a conserved synteny of ftr82/83
and a few neighboring markers was established in
zebrafish, stickleback and medaka, indicating that they
were kept in a more stable genomic context than other
fintrims; it is also worth noting that in the medaka, these
genes have retained the six-exon structure. Also, several
markers located close to ftr82/83 in fish possess counterparts on the human chromosome 17, where both trim16
and trim25 are located together with the markers defining
their own conserved syntenies among vertebrates. This
loose association is unlikely to have occurred by chance,
and may suggest that certain group C fintrims could constitute an intermediate between the main fintrim family
and the older trim genes (presumably trim25; trim16 is an
unlikely candidate since its RBB domain is truncated)
from which they appeared by duplication. This hypothesis
fits well with the whole-genome duplication that occurred
in the beginning of teleost evolution [58]. Along the same
line, ftr82 and ftr83, together with ftr84, are the most similar to trim25 among the fintrim relatives (see ftr/btr tree in
Additional file 1 – Figure S1, and Figure 7). TRIM25 is
involved in IFN signaling, but interacts with endogenous
RIG-I and not with viral proteins [20]. It is therefore
tempting to speculate that ftr82 and ftr83 have been
restrained from duplications and diversifying selection by
such a functional specialization. Such a contrasted evolutionary history has been observed for example for the
CytP450 superfamily: enzymes with endogenous substrates are phylogenetically stable, while xenobiotic
detoxifiers are encoded in unstable gene islands that
appeared by tandem duplication [59]. It could be argued
that the quick radiation of group A fintrims was triggered
when a trim25-like ftr acquired a B30.2 exon maybe
derived from a NLR gene, allowing the newly created
finTRIM to directly detect a pathogen motif. Such an event
would have occurred after the teleost-tetrapod split, and
perhaps even after the divergence of main teleost lineages,
as illustrated in Figure 8. It has to be underlined here that
the phylogenetic analysis does not support a monophyletic origin of group B fintrims, which therefore probably constitute the tracks of several duplication/
differentiation events in the finTRIM group. Such duplication events have been suggested to explain the expansion
of TRIM genes in fish and other species [17]. A recent
extensive survey of TRIMs divided these proteins into two
large groups: an evolutionary conserved group I comprising TRIM with various C-terminal domains, and a more
recent group II that groups sequences containing a B30.2

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/7

domain and showing species-specific diversification. The
presence of two B-box motifs – although the B-box-1 is
rather degenerated – and the sequence similarity to
TRIM16 and TRIM25 suggest that finTRIMs may be closer
to group I. However, the finTRIM evolutionary pathway
described here fits better the properties of the group II.
Our observations seem to reflect a fish-specific evolutionary pathway of a TRIM subset derived from ancestral
group I members by an ancient duplication.
The evolutionary pathways of trim39 is rather different
since it was retrieved as a single gene in mammals but as
a multigene set in several teleosts. TRIM39 is a member of
the group II as described in [17] and the diversification
observed in the zebrafish is well in accordance with the
evolutionary properties of this group. Thus, there are
more than 30 orthologs of trim39 in zebrafish. We named
these genes btrs for 'bloodthirsty-like TRIMs', as one of
them is known as bloodthirsty, a gene involved in erythropoiesis [41]. These observations indicate that trim39 was
already present in the common ancestor to fish and mammals, but was subjected to a successful expansion by
duplication in at least some lineages of teleosts.

Conclusion
In conclusion, our results indicate that the finTRIM family
has been subjected to a quick, extensive diversification by
duplication and specialization under positive selection
exerted on positions concentrated in the B30.2 domain.
The sharing of B30.2 domains with NLR emphasizes the
shuffling of a putative target-binding module between
two major protein families involved in immune recognition of pathogen specific motifs [39,40]. While the targets
of finTRIMs have yet to be identified, this first survey suggests that finTRIMs are involved the antiviral innate
immune system. Our future work will be aimed at a further understanding of the biological functions of the
finTRIMs.

Methods
Trout leukocyte preparation
Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were raised in the
Jouy-en-Josas experimental fish facility. The fish were sacrificed by overexposure to 1‰ 2-phenoxyethanol (2-PE).
The entire pronephros were removed aseptically and dissected. Cells from the pronephros of a single fish were
deposited on a Ficoll solution (Lymphocyte separation
medium [d 1.077]; Eurobio, Les Ulis, France) and centrifuged 10 min at 900 G. The leukocyte fraction at the
Ficoll-medium interface was collected and subsequently
used in the finTRIM stimulation experiments and mRNA
isolation. Homozygous rainbow trout clones were produced using a gynogenesis-based strategy [60]. A population of doubled haploids was first established, using a
mitotic gynogenesis procedure as described. At the next

generation, homozygous clones (G-clones) were obtained
using meio-gynogenetic reproduction of individual
homozygous doubled haploid females. Within a G-clone,
some progeny were sex-reversed by early hormonal treatment to obtain functional XX males, and these animals
were crossed with females from the same G-clone to produce N-clones. Such animals (N-clones) were used in this
study.
Cells and viruses
Trout RTG-2 and carp EPC cell lines were used for virus
production and titration. They were cultured in BHK-21
medium (Invitrogen-Gibco, Leek, The Netherlands), supplemented with 10% (V/V) fetal calf serum (FCS) (Eurobio), 10% (V/V) tryptose broth, streptomycin (50 μg/ml)
and penicillin (50 units/ml). African green monkey COS7 cells were used for rainbow trout recombinant interferon production. They were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (Eurobio), supplemented with 10%
(V/V) fetal calf serum. COS-7 cells were transfected with
an expression plasmid encoding trout interferon (from
AY788890) using FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent
(Roche, Neuilly, France) and supernatant was collected
and titrated. Interferon at 1000 U/ml was used to study
induction kinetics. Cycloheximide (100 μg/ml) (Sigma
Aldrich, Saint-Quentin, France) was used to block cell
protein synthesis. Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus
(VHSV) strain 07–71 [61] was inactivated by overnight
treatment with diluted (1/4000) β-propiolactone (BPL).
For the stimulation of finTRIM expression, 50 μg/ml
Poly(I:C) (Sigma-Aldrich), 100 μg/ml of Eschericha coli
lipopolysaccharide (LPS from E. coli 0127B8; SigmaAldrich) were used. Spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV)
and a heat-adapted variant of infectious hematopoietic
necrosis virus (IHNV) were used for zebrafish infection
experiments. SVCV was diluted to 107 pfu/ml and IHNV
to 5×106 pfu/ml in PBS containing 0.1% phenol red; viral
suspensions were kept as much as possible on ice.
Zebrafish embryos experiments
Zebrafish (Danio rerio) of the AB strain, initially obtained
from the Zebrafish International Resource Center (ZIRC,
Eugene, OR) or F1 derived from this stock were raised in
the Institut Pasteur facility and mated to obtain eggs. IFNover-expressing embryos were obtained as described in
[62]. Embryos were injected at the one-cell stage with 12
pg of plasmid DNA driving expression of zebrafish IFN1;
as a control for successful injection, the DNA solution also
included a plasmid driving expression of the fluorescent
mCherry protein. As controls, some embryos were
injected with the mCherry plasmid alone. Embryos were
then allowed to develop at 28°C. At 24 hpf (hours postfertilization) they were sorted under a fluorescence stereomicroscope to retain only mCherry-expressing animals;
abnormally developing embryos were also discarded. At

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/7

72 hpf, the larvae were euthanized with 2-PE and homogenized in Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) for RNA extraction.
For viral infections, non-manipulated larvae that had
been left to develop for 3 days at 24°C were dechorionated, anesthetized with Tricaine (Sigma-aldrich), and
microinjected with 1 nl of viral suspension in the venous
plexus located just posterior to the cloaca. They were then
incubated at 24°C for 24 h in the case of SVCV, or 48 h in
the case of IHNV (yielding larvae at a developmental stage
corresponding roughly to 78 hpf and 96 hpf at 28.5°C,
respectively); at this time point infection was well
advanced, but all embryos were still alive. Embryos were
then sacrificed and treated with Trizol as above. Uninjected control larvae, incubated at the same temperature
and for the same durations, were processed in parallel
from the same clutches. Ten to fifteen larvae were
included for each point.
RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, 5' and 3'-RACE PCR
Total RNA was extracted with the Trizol reagent according
to the manufacturer's instructions, then treated with 5
units of RNAse-free DNase (Invitrogen) to remove any
remaining genomic DNA. cDNA was synthesized from
total RNA using either an oligo(dT) primer or the SMART
PCR cDNA Synthesis Kit (Clontech BD, Saint-Germainen-Laye, France). The 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends
5'-RACE PCR and 3'-RACE PCR were performed using the
SMART RACE cDNA Amplification Kit (Clontech BD),
according to the instructions of the manufacturer. 5' and
3'-RACE PCRs were performed with relevant specific
primers (see Table 4) and the universal primers from
Clontech. In rainbow trout, the 3'-RACE PCR was performed from VHSV-induced leukocyte cDNA using a universal primer specific for trout finTRIM localized in the
highly conserved region around the start codon. This conserved region was confirmed through EST analysis and
sequencing of 10 clones generated by a 5'-RACE experiment using the same template. For zebrafish samples, 3'RACE was performed using Invitrogen's GeneRacer kit,

with two rounds of amplification (round one with primers zftruniv1S and GeneRacer 3' primer, round two with
zftruniv2S and GeneRacer nested 3' primer); the consensus primers are located in the RING domain.
Cloning and sequencing of PCR products
The trout PCR products were purified with Sephacryl S400 columns (Pharmacia, Paris, France) and then cloned
using the TOPO T/A Cloning Kit (Invitrogen). Upon
transformation of E. coli, plasmid was isolated by the
Nucleospin Plasmid Quickpure kit (Nucleospin; Macherey-Nagel, Düren, France). Purified plasmids were subjected to automated sequencing with M13 direct and
reverse primers and with internal primers for long transcripts. Zebrafish RACE products were treated in a comparable manner but with different reagents: PCR products
were purified on Qiaquick spin columns (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) and cloned in the pGEMT-easy vector
(Promega, Charbonnières-les-Bains, France); plasmids
were purified with QiaPrep Miniprep kits (Qiagen) and
sequencing was performed initially with SP6 and T7 primers.
Real-time RT-PCR assay
Real-time RT-PCR reactions were performed using the
SYBR green reagent from Applied Biosystems (Applied
Biosystems, Les Ulis, France) and Eppendorf Mastercycler
realplex2 S (Eppendorf, Le Pecq, France), according to
manufacturer's instructions. All reactions were performed
in duplicate. Data analysis was performed as described in
the ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection bulletin #2 from
Applied Biosystems, following the Δ Ct method. Oligonucleotides used for real-time RT-PCR are indicated in Table
4.
Strategy for identification and alignment of finTRIM
sequences
The finTRIM sequences were assembled using the tools of
the Genetic Computer Group (GCG; Madison University,
Wisconsin) and the DNA strider software (CEA, Gif-surYvette, France). The sequences were subjected to multiple
sequence alignments using GCG (pileup) or ClustalW,
and multiple alignments were edited using Boxshade software. Systematic searches for finTRIM were done using the
tblastn program with rainbow trout or zebrafish
sequences as a query, on available EST and genome databases. Searches in EST databases were mainly performed
at the NCBI and Dana Farber Institute websites. Blast queries on complete genomes were sent to Ensembl and
NCBI. The last assembly of the zebrafish genome (zv7)
was searched at the Ensembl site. When relevant genomic
regions were identified, potential exons were manually
identified by comparison with known sequences, notably
RACE clones, with the help of predictions made by Genscan http://genes.mit.edu/GENSCAN.html.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/7

Detection of positive selection
The dataset for positive selection analysis was prepared
from the zebrafish group A finTRIM (ftr) sequences that
were found on the Ensembl zebrafish Zv7 assembly. Three
datasets were prepared, corresponding to sequences coding for the RING and B-box 1 and 2 (RBB) domains (55
sequences) and the B30.2 domain (38 sequences).
Domains were identified by the web-based tool Simple
Modular Architecture Research Tool (SMART) at http://
smart.embl-heidelberg.de/. A multiple sequence alignment was made for each domain with ClustalW within the
MEGA4 software and gaps were removed from the alignment. The final datasets consisted of 155 codons for the
RING and B-box domains and 145 codons for the B30.2
domain. The phylogenetic trees were constructed by the
Neighbor-Joining method using MEGA4.

The Codeml program of the Phylogeny Analysis by Maximum Likelihood (PAML) package [63], retrieved from
was
http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software/paml.html,
used for the detection of positive selection. The models
M0, M1a, M2a, M7 and M8 were employed. The ratio of
synonymous (dS) to non-synonymous (dN) substitution
rates, ω = dS/dN, is determined by the program. A value of
ω < 1 indicates negative, purifying selection, ω = 1 indicates neutral evolution and ω >1 indicates the occurrence
of diversifying, positive selection. We used the site-specific
model that allows ω to vary among sites. The null models
M0, M1a and M7 do not allow the existence of positively
selected sites (ω >1), while the alternate models M2a and
M8 allow ω >1. M8 follows a beta(p, q)-distribution and
is less stringent than M2a. Within the models, a Maximum
Likelihood algorithm is used, whereby the sites are allocated under classes of different ω probabilities. Sites allocated under the class with ω >1 are considered as being
under positive selection and were identified by a Bayes
Empirical Bayes (BEB) analysis. Significance of outcome
was confirmed by a likelihood ratio test (LRT). In the LTR
we took twice the difference in log likelihood (2ΔlnL)
between the nested models and used the chi-square test
with the degrees of freedom (df) being the difference in
free parameters between the two models (M1a vs. M2a
and M7 vs. M8). Tests were considered positive when p <
0.001. Sites identified by BEB with a posterior probability
higher than 95% were considered significant.
Analysis for recombination
To test for interference of recombination on the PAML
results, we implemented a test by the algorithm PARRIS
[64]. Under PARRIS, the PAML models M1a-M2a are
employed with incorporation of site-to-site variation in
synonymous substitutions rates and partitioning of data.
We used the codon model for evolution GY94 × HKY85
and a discrete distribution of three bins for synonymous

tested by a LRT.
