Abstract
Background: For phylogenetic reconstructions, conflict in signal is a potential problem for tree reconstruction. For
instance, molecular data from different cellular components, such as the mitochondrion and nucleus, may be
inconsistent with each other. Mammalian studies provide one such case of conflict where mitochondrial data,
which display compositional biases, support the Marsupionta hypothesis, but nuclear data confirm the Theria
hypothesis. Most observations of compositional biases in tree reconstruction have focused on lineages with
different composition than the majority of the lineages under analysis. However in some situations, the position of
taxa that lack compositional bias may be influenced rather than the position of taxa that possess compositional
bias. This situation is due to apparent symplesiomorphic characters and known as “the symplesiomorphy trap”.
Results: Herein, we report an example of the sympleisomorphy trap and how to detect it. Worms within
Terebelliformia (sensu Rouse & Pleijel 2001) are mainly tube-dwelling annelids comprising five ‘families’: Alvinellidae,
Ampharetidae, Terebellidae, Trichobranchidae and Pectinariidae. Using mitochondrial genomic data, as well as data
from the nuclear 18S, 28S rDNA and elongation factor-1a genes, we revealed incongruence between
mitochondrial and nuclear data regarding the placement of Trichobranchidae. Mitochondrial data favored a sister
relationship between Terebellidae and Trichobranchidae, but nuclear data placed Trichobranchidae as sister to an
Ampharetidae/Alvinellidae clade. Both positions have been proposed based on morphological data.
Conclusions: Our investigation revealed that mitochondrial data of Ampharetidae and Alvinellidae exhibited strong
compositional biases. However, these biases resulted in a misplacement of Trichobranchidae, rather than
Alvinellidae and Ampharetidae. Herein, we document that Trichobranchidae was apparently caught in the
symplesiomorphy trap suggesting that in certain situations even homologies can be misleading.

Background
The amount of data used in phylogenetic reconstructions has been steadily increasing during the past decade
[e.g., [1-4]], and phylogenies based on multiple datasets
(i.e., partitions) are now common. However, analyses
based on different partitions do not always result in
congruent phylogenetic reconstructions. Molecular evolutionary events such as gene duplication, horizontal
gene transfer, heterotachy, gene extinction, long-branch
attraction, saturation and model misspecifications can
cause inferred gene trees to differ from species trees.
For example, incongruence regarding phylogenetic

placement of taxa can occur between mitochondrial and
nuclear data [e.g., [5]]. In the case of mammals, mitochondrial data strongly support the Marsupionta
hypothesis placing Marsupialia as sister to Monotremata
(Figure 1A) [6-11], whereas the Theria hypothesis,
which places Marsupialia with Placentalia, has been
strongly supported by both morphological and nuclear
data [e.g., [12-14]]. Phillips and Penny [15] showed that
strong compositional biases in pyrimidine and purine
frequencies in mitochondrial genomes of Marsupialia
and Monotremata provided support for the Marsupionta
hypothesis. However, both partitioning the dataset and
to a lesser degree RY coding were able to effectively
minimize artificial signal. In general, taxa affected by
biases such as increased substitutions rates, heterotachy,
etc., are the ones misplaced in phylogenetic analyses.

inclusive taxonomic units are indicated for reasons of simplicity.

However, biases may also influence the placement of
unbiased taxa. In the case of the symplesiomorphy trap
[16], a paraphyletic assemblage of taxa is grouped
together as monophyletic based on the possession of
symplesiomorphic characters, which are mistakenly
assumed to be apomorphic. The symplesiomorphy trap
has been characterized as a special class of long-branch
attraction by Wägele & Mayer [17].
This problem is common for morphological data and
several instances are known. One well-known annelid
example is the position of Clitellata as sister to Polychaeta due to the lack of typical polychaete characters
such as parapodia and nuchal organs [18]. However,
molecular data clearly place Clitellata within polychaetes
[e.g., [2,3,19]]. In theory, the symplesiomorphy trap is not
restricted to morphological data, but can also apply to
sequence data [16]. However, studies addressing this problem in molecular data are scarce because detection of
the trap is not straightforward. First, the misplaced taxa
are not themselves affected by compositional biases or
increased substitution rates. Second, support for monophyly of misplaced taxa is based on apomorphies for a
higher taxonomic unit and hence not artificial. Third,
knowledge of the ‘true’ phylogeny is needed to directly
detect the symplesiomorphy trap. Typically, detection of
the trap occurs indirectly by excluding other possibilities
of incongruence and revealing characteristic signatures in
the data. For example, Wägele and Mayer’s [17] study
showed that misplacement of Acrothoracica barnacles in
a 18S parsimony analysis was due to symplesiomorphic
characters shared exclusively by Ascothoracida (a nonbarnacle outgroup) and Acrothoracica (Figure 1B). These
characters overwhelmed the phylogenetic signal for the
monophyly of Cirripedia. This phenomenon is known as
the symplesiomorphy trap.
Here we report another instance of the symplesiomorphy trap in molecular data discovered while examining
Terebelliformia (Annelida) phylogeny. Terebelliform
worms [sensu [20]] are typically tube-dwelling annelids,
found in diverse marine habitats, including intertidal,
deep-sea and even hydrothermal vent areas.

Terebelliformia include about 800 species within five
‘families’: Alvinellidae, Ampharetidae, Terebellidae, Trichobranchidae and Pectinariidae [20-22]. Based on thorough investigations using data partitioning, topology
tests, removal and addition of taxa, spectral analyses,
detection of compositional biases, models of non-stationary sequence evolution, and recoding of characters,
we were able to pinpoint the source of the incongruence
between mitochondrial and nuclear data and relate it to
the symplesiomorphy trap. Ampharetidae and Alvinellidae exhibit strong compositional biases in their mitochondrial genomes. However, these biases affect
placement of Trichobranchidae and Terebellidae rather
than Ampharetidae and Alvinellidae.

Methods
Sample and Data Collection

Table 1 lists taxa, gene sequences, GenBank accession
numbers and sample locations used in this study. Upon
collection, tissue samples were preserved in >70% nondenatured ethanol or frozen at -80°C. Genomic DNA
was extracted using the DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Mitochondrial genomes were amplified following
Zhong et al. [23] in four overlapping segments using
species-specific primers (for more details see Additional
File 1). Amplification and sequencing of nuclear 18S
and 28S genes was carried out using protocols described
by Struck et al. [24]. Presence of PCR products were
confirmed on a 1% agarose gel and purified with the
QIAquick PCR Purification or QIAquick Gel Extraction
kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). When necessary, PCR
products were size-selected on agarose gels and/or
cloned using pGEM®-T Easy Vector System (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA) or StrataClone™ PCR Cloning Kit
(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). A CEQ™ 8000 Genetic
Analysis System (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA)
or ABI Prism 377 Automatic Sequencer (Perkin Elmer,
Shelton, CT, USA) was used for bidirectional sequencing
of all PCR products.
Genomic Assembly and Gene Identification

Sequences were edited and aligned using DNASTAR™
Lasergene programs SeqMan and MegAlign [25]. Protein-coding genes and ribosomal RNA genes were identified by BLAST [26]. All tRNA genes were identified
using tRNAscan-SE web server [http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/
tRNAscan-SE/, [27]] under default settings and source =
“mito/chloroplast”, or by hand based on their potential
secondary structures and anticodon sequences.
Datasets

Datasets consisted of mitochondrial and nuclear data.

treebase.org. Seventeen available annelid mitochondrial
genomes with about 50% coverage or greater were used
for the phylogenetic analyses (Table 1). The alignment
of Zhong et al. [23] was employed with the addition of
Nephtys sp., Pectinaria gouldi, Paralvinella sulfincola
and Auchenoplax crinita. Because we were interested in
relationships within Terebelliformia, we deleted the
mitochondrial data of Katharina (Mollusca) and Terebratalia (Brachiopoda) and used all other annelids as outgroup taxa.

Both nucleotide and amino acid datasets were created
for mitochondrial phylogenetic analyses. In the nucleotide dataset, all protein-coding genes (except for atp6,
atp8 and nad6 genes which exhibit high variability) and
the two rRNA genes (mLSU and mSSU) were included.
Clustal X [28] under default settings was used to align
rRNA genes. Gblocks 0.91b [29] was used to identify
ambiguous aligned regions in the rRNA genes. These
regions and the 3rd positions of protein-coding genes,
which are saturated with substitutions for family-level

analyses, were excluded from the analyses with the aid
of MacClade4.08 [30] and Se-Al v2.0a11 [31]. The
amino acid dataset was created from the aligned nucleotide dataset by translation of protein-coding genes with
the Drosophila mitochondrial genetic code and exclusion of rRNA genes. The mitochondrial nucleotide and
amino acid datasets comprised 6,287 and 2,990 positions, respectively.
Additionally, a combined data matrix was constructed
with the addition of 18S, 28S and EF-1a sequences to
the mitochondrial data for the above 17 taxa (Table 1).
Because we employed data from GenBank and collected
data in two different laboratories (Univ. of Osnabrück
and Auburn Univ.), in some cases we concatenated data
from as closely related species as possible to generate
Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) with a more
complete coverage (see Table 1). Sequences were aligned
as above. Due to the addition of nuclear data, the combined datasets comprised 11,813 nucleotide and 3,331
amino acid positions. The amino acid dataset comprised
only the protein-coding genes.
Moreover, we also constructed a nuclear dataset comprising only 18S, 28S and EF-1a sequences at the
nucleotide level for these 17 taxa (Table 1). The nuclear
dataset comprised 5,526 nucleotide positions. Analyses
of nuclear ribosomal gene datasets were also based on
32 and 61 taxa to reveal if taxon sampling had a substantial impact on the phylogenetic reconstruction of
the nuclear data. By comparison, taxon sampling was far
more limited for mitochondrial genome sequences.
Additional File 2 provides a summary of the construction of these datasets with more than 17 taxa.
Phylogenetic Analyses

Maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI)
approaches were employed for all mitochondrial, nuclear
and combined datasets. For all nucleotide datasets with
17 taxa, ML analyses were performed in PAUP4.0b10
[32] with a GTR+Γ+I model as determined by Modeltest
v3.7 based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC)
[33,34]. Heuristic searches were run with random-taxon
addition (10 replicates) using Tree-Bisection-Reconnection (TBR) swapping. All model parameters used fixed
values as determined by Modeltest v3.7. Bootstrap analyses employed 1,000 iterations using heuristic searches
with 10 random taxa addition replicates. Partitioned ML
analyses were conducted with RAxML 7.2.8 [35] using a
GTR+Γ+I model for each individual gene and 200 bootstrap replicates followed by a best tree search. Partitioned BI invoked independent substitution models for
each gene in MrBayes version 3.1.2 [36] and ran for
5*106 (mitochondrial and nuclear) or 2*106 (combined)
generations, respectively, with 2 runs of 4 chains (3
heated and 1 cold). Trees were sampled every 100

Page 4 of 15

generations. The implemented diagnosis feature comparing the 2 runs by average standard deviation of split
frequencies was determined every 10,000 generations.
GTR+Γ+I models were selected under the AIC in
MrModeltest [37,38] for 18S and 28S rDNA, EF-1a,
cox1, cox2, cob, nad1, nad3, and nad4, GTR+I models
for both 12S and 16S rDNA, GTR+Γ model for cox3,
and HKY+Γ model for nad2, nad4L and nad5. Convergence of -ln likelihood scores and tree length was determined using Tracer v1.4.1 [39] to identify the burnin
point at which all estimated parameters reached equilibrium (burnin = 100 trees). The majority-rule consensus
tree containing posterior probabilities (PP) was determined from the remaining trees. Additional File 2 provides a more detailed description of the analyses and
results for the datasets with more than 17 taxa.
For both amino acid datasets (mitochondrial and combined data with 17 taxa), non-partitioned and partitioned ML, and partitioned BI analyses were run. For
ML analyses, model selection was performed in RAxML
7.2.8 [35] and the MtZOA+Γ+I+F model was chosen as
the best-fitting one for both non-partitioned datasets.
For individual genes, MtZOA+Γ+I models were selected
for cox1, cox2 (additionally +F), cox3 and cob, and
DAYHOFF+Γ+I for nad1, nad2, nad3, nad4, nad4L,
nad5 and EF-1a. Maximum likelihood searches were
implemented with 200 bootstrap replicates using
RAxML [35] followed by a ML tree search for both
non-partitioned and partitioned ML analyses. For partitioned BI of amino acid datasets, the mixed amino acid
substitution model option plus a Γ distribution and a
proportion of invariant sites was assigned to each partition individually and unlinked in MrBayes v3.1.2. BI ran
for 2*106 generations and trees sampled every 500 generations (burnin = 20 trees). In the mixed model option,
a specific model is not specified a priori, but each
model is chosen during the run based on its posterior
probability.
Non-stationary sequence evolution

To analyze data in a non-stationary Bayesian framework,
we used PHASE 2.0 [40] to allow usage of different
compositional vectors along branches of the tree. As in
stationary Bayesian inferences using MrBayes, we conducted partitioned analyses for nucleotide datasets with
17 taxa of both mitochondrial and nuclear data invoking
previously mentioned substitution models for each gene
(except that the proportion-of-invariant-sites parameter
is not available in PHASE 2.0). We performed analyses
based on 3, 6 or 9 different compositional vectors. For
each number of compositional vectors, we ran 4 independent runs, with one cold chain each and different
random seeds (i.e., 3, 11, 88, and 1000), in parallel. Each
run ran for 12*106 generations and trees were sampled
every 1,000 generations. The first 2*10 6 generations

v1.4.1[39].

these relationships. The PERL script to retrieve these
bipartitions is available from THS upon request.

Topology testing

Determination of Compositional Biases

To further understand congruence and incongruence in
our datasets, the Approximately Unbiased (AU) topology
test of CONSEL [41,42] was employed to assess support
for alternative hypotheses. More specifically under the
ML criterion, AU tests compared the three possible terebelliform hypotheses with respect to incongruence for
each possible combination of partitions in the 17-taxa
case (i.e., 18S, 28S, mtDNA, 18S/28S, 18S/EF-1a, 18S/
mtDNA, 28S/EF-1a, 28S/mtDNA, EF-1a/mtDNA, 18S/
28S/EF-1a, 18S/28S/mtDNA, 18S/EF-1a/mtDNA, 28S/
EF-1a/mtDNA, and 18S/28S/EF-1a/mtDNA). Based on
initial results, the following hypotheses were tested: 1)
Trichobranchidae as sister to Alvinellidae/Ampharetidae
(TriAA), 2) Trichobranchidae as sister to Terebellidae
(TriTer), and 3) Terebellidae as sister to Alvinellidae/
Ampharetidae (TerAA). PAUP analyses were constrained to obtain only the best trees congruent with the
particular hypothesis. Settings for the analyses were as
described above.

We also analyzed our nuclear and mitochondrial datasets for compositional biases, which can mislead phylogenetic analyses [e.g., [15,45-53]]. First, we employed
relative composition variability (RCV), which is the average variability in composition between taxa for a dataset
[15]. Phillips and Penny [15] used absolute numbers of
nucleotide occurrence for calculation of RCV. However,
this means that the RCV value does not only reflect
composition variability, but also sequence length variability in the dataset. Therefore, we created a measure of
relative composition frequency variability (RCFV) by
modifying the RCV calculation to use base frequencies
instead of absolute numbers:

Spectral Analyses

We conducted spectral analyses to gain further insights
into the support for specific bipartitions (or splits)
[43,44] because they have been useful in the detection
of the symplesiomorphy trap [17]. A bipartition splits a
set of OTUs into two groups. In the context of spectral
analyses, we use the term ingroup (italicized here to distinguish its usage in spectral analyses from common systematic usage) to define the group of the bipartition we
are interested in, and outgroup for the other group of
that bipartition. For example, Trichobranchidae, Alvinellidae and Ampharetidae in one group of the bipartition,
the ingroup, and all others including Terebellidae in the
other, the outgroup, would be congruent with the TriAA
hypothesis. To calculate and visualize the bipartition
support, we used Splits Analyses MethodS [SAMS, [17]]
and Microsoft Excel for mitochondrial, nuclear and
combined datasets with 17 taxa. SAMS is a split-decomposition tool that does not require Hadamard conjugations. Hence, there is no need to consider the complete
split space. SAMS differentiates support for a bipartition
into three categories: 1) binary, both groups exhibit only
one character state each, but different from each other;
2) noisy outgroup (i.e., while the ingroup exhibits only
one state the outgroup exhibits more than one state,
though a majority state within the group can still be
identified); 3) noisy ingroup and outgroup [17]. Because
we were only interested in bipartitions regarding relationships within Terebelliformia, we only retrieved
bipartitions from the results that were relevant regarding

skew values to determine if strong biases between two
nucleotide frequencies exist. Perna and Kocher [54]
introduced the A-T and G-C skews for an individual
strand of nucleic acids. Herein, we additionally propose
A-G and C-T skews, because for mitochondrial genomes, major mutational biases are within purine and
pyrimidine frequencies, respectively [55]. A-G and C-T
skews for a taxon are calculated the same way as A-T

sister relationship between Trichobranchidae and Terebellidae, the TriTer hypothesis (BS: 95 for nNuc, 100 for
pNuc, 62 for nAA and 84 for pAA; PP: 1.00 for both).
Furthermore, topology testing significantly rejected a sistergroup relationship of Trichobranchidae to Alvinellidae/Ampharetidae, the TriAA hypothesis (p = 0.003), as
well as Terebellidae as sister to Alvinellidae/Ampharetidae, the TerAA hypothesis (p = 0.028). Two Ampharetidae taxa were close to Alvinellidae in the analyses of
both mitochondrial datasets (BS: 100 for all four; PP:
1.00 for both). Pectinariidae was shown to be the basal
lineage in Terebelliformia except in the partitioned ML
analysis of the nucleotide dataset, which placed Pectinaridae as sister to Trichobranchidae/Terebellidae (BS:
72, data not shown).
Nuclear datasets

ML and partitioned BI of the 17-taxa, three-nucleargene (i.e., 18S, 28S and EF-1a) dataset inferred an identical topology with respect to terebelliform relationships
(Figure 2a). Interestingly, monophyly of Terebelliformia
was not recovered as Pectinaria gouldi was placed as sister to the sipunculid Phascolopsis gouldi, albeit with
weak support (Figure 2a). The other four terebelliform
taxa formed a clade with stronger nodal support (BS: 86
for nNuc, 100 for pNuc; PP 1.00) than in mitochondrial
analyses (BS: 69 for nNuc, <50 for pNuc; PP: 0.92,

Figure 2b). As for the mitochondrial analyses, a sistergroup relationship of Alvinellidae and Ampharetidae
is well corroborated (BS: 98 for nNuc, 99 for pNuc; PP:
1.00). Moreover, the TriAA hypothesis was supported
(BS: 96 for nNuc, 92 for pNuc; PP: 1.00) and topology
testing significantly rejects the alternative TriTer
(favored by the mitochondrial data) and TerAA hypotheses (p = 0.038 and p = 0.006, respectively).
Combined datasets

Phylogenetic trees from combined analyses (Figure 2c &
Additional File 3) were similar to the ones from mitochondrial data (Figure 2b) with differences occurring in
outgroup relationships. Monophyly of Terebelliformia is
significantly supported in these analyses (BS: 99 for
nNuc, 100 for pNuc, 98 for nAA and 93 for pAA; PP:
1.00 for both; Figure 2c, Additional File 3). Pectinariidae
branched off first within terebelliforms (BS: 95 for
nNuc, 100 for pNuc, 96 for nAA and 72 for pAA; PP:
1.00 for both). Alvinellidae was recovered as sister to
Ampharetidae (BS: 100 for all four; PP: 1.00 for both).
Trichobranchidae was placed as sister to Terebellidae,
the TriTer hypothesis, in all analyses. However, bootstrap support for the TriTer hypothesis in the combined
analyses was generally lower than in mtDNA alone analyses (83 in nNuc, 95 in pNuc, 41 in nAA, and 74 in
pAA compared to 95, 100, 62, and 84, respectively; Figure 2 & Additional File 3). Furthermore in contrast to

the mitochondrial Nuc dataset, topology testing did not
significantly reject the alternative TriAA hypothesis
favored by the nuclear dataset (p = 0.184), though the
TerAA hypothesis is still significantly rejected (p =
0.012).
Congruence and Incongruence between Partitions
regarding Terebelliformia

Due to these results, we further explored conflict
regarding the TriTer and TriAA hypotheses indicated
by mtDNA (Figure 2b) or nuclear partitions (Figure 2a),
respectively. Therefore, we conducted phylogenetic analyses and topology testing for all possible combinations
of the four partitions (18S, 28S, EF-1a, mtDNA) when
using 17 taxa. These analyses showed that when the
mitochondrial data partition was added, the TriTer
hypothesis was supported, whereas all possible combinations of the three nuclear genes, excluding mtDNA data,
recovered the TriAA hypothesis. With an increasing
amount of nuclear data (mitochondrial partition
excluded) bootstrap support for the TriAA hypothesis
steadily increased (black circles in Figure 3a), while
bootstrap support for the TriTer hypothesis remained
low (grey circles in Figure 3a). Furthermore, the p value
of the AU test for the TriTer hypothesis decreased with
an increasing amount of nuclear data from a non-significant value of 0.447 to a significant one of 0.041 (Figure
3b, grey circles and trend line). On the other hand, in
all datasets including mitochondrial data bootstrap support for the TriTer hypothesis was high, though it
slightly decreased with an increasing amount of nuclear
data (grey triangles in Figure 3a), and, vice versa, the
bootstrap support for the TriAA hypothesis was low,
but slightly increased with increasing nuclear data (black
triangles in Figure 3a). However, as the proportion of

Spectral Analyses

Spectral analyses revealed that 160 positions of the 17taxon nuclear dataset support the TriAA hypothesis
(Figure 4a) recovered in the best tree (Figure 2a). One
hundred and five positions are consistent with the TriTer hypothesis favored by the mtDNA data and 91 with
the TerAA hypothesis. This is congruent with the
results of the topology tests based on the 17-taxon
nuclear dataset, where the TriTer hypothesis had a
higher p value than the TerAA hypothesis (0.038 >
0.006). However for the mitochondrial dataset with 17
taxa, similar numbers of positions, 103 and 102, support
the TerAA and TriAA hypothesis, respectively. On the
other hand, only 49 positions are consistent with the
TriTer hypothesis, which was recovered by the best tree
of the mitochondrial dataset (Figure 2b).
Besides the number of positions, the quality of supporting positions is different for these three alternative
hypotheses in both 17-taxon datasets. For the nuclear
dataset, two binary positions support the TriAA hypothesis (black color in Figure 4a) and no binary positions
support the TriTer and TerAA hypotheses. In contrast,
no binary positions are found to support any of the
three hypotheses in the mitochondrial dataset. All other

and independent of the inclusion of mitochondrial data,
the p value for the TerAA hypothesis decreased with an
increasing amount of nuclear data (open triangles and

revealed that nuclear data favor the TriAA hypothesis,
whereas mitochondrial data favor the TriTer hypothesis.

Based on analyses herein, placement of Trichobranchidae is incongruent between mitochondrial and nuclear
data. To further investigate possible sources of incongruence with regards to Trichobranchidae placement,
we examined two properties known to mislead placement of taxa, placement of the root and base composition heterogeneity.

Poor taxon sampling can also influence taxon placement and rooting [58,59]. As we could not easily
increase the available number of mitochondrial genomes
for Terebelliformia, we focused on adding more nuclear
data and included 18 new 18S and 13 28S sequences for
Terebelliformia and one cirratulid to the available data
(Additional File 2). Phylogenetic analyses of this dataset
comprising 32 taxa also recovered a sistergroup relationship of Trichobranchidae to Alvinellidae/Ampharetidae
(BS: 80; PP: 0.95) within a monophyletic Terebelliformia.
Additionally, the 61-taxon dataset based only on 18S
rRNA data failed to provide resolution within Terebelliformia (Additional File 2); thus, neither exclusion of
long-branched taxa nor an increased taxon sampling
had an influence on the placement of the root for the
nuclear data.

Placement of the root

Base composition

With respect to the relationships of Trichobranchidae,
Terebellidae, Alvinellidae and Ampharetidae to each
other, mitochondrial and nuclear partitions yield identical subtrees that were rooted differently (Figure 5).
Effects of long-branched outgroups and basal taxa misleading placement of the root have been long known
[for review see [56]]. Pectinaria gouldi, as well as Phascolopsis gouldi, exhibit long branches in nuclear rRNA
data [[19,57] and see also Additional File 2]. However,
Pectinariidae is placed as sister to the other terebelliform taxa and may influence placement of Trichobranchidae within the nuclear dataset (Figure 2, Additional
File 2). Nuclear data of Scoloplos cf. armiger also exhibited a long branch on the reconstructed topology (Figure
2a). Therefore, we excluded these taxa (Pectinaria
gouldi, Phascolopsis gouldi, Scoloplos cf. armiger) to
examine the possibility of long-branch attraction, but
found that they did not influence placement of the root
or Trichobranchidae. All combinations of nuclear genes
still favored the TriAA hypothesis, whereas the addition
of the mitochondrial data always rendered Trichobranchidae being sister to Terebellidae in ML reconstructions. Correspondingly, results of topology tests are not
altered substantially by excluding these three long
branched taxa (compare Figure 3c with Figure 3b).

Evaluations of base composition heterogeneity showed a
strong difference between nuclear and mitochondrial
data. The RCFV value for mitochondrial data (0.0494)
was much greater than for nuclear data (0.0159). Thus,
mitochondrial data exhibit a stronger compositional heterogeneity. For mitochondrial data, taxon-specific RCFV
values (Figure 6a) showed that Alvinellidae, and especially Ampharetidae, had much higher values than the
other terebelliforms or the average outgroup value indicating strong compositional biases in Alvinellidae and
Ampharetidae. No obvious biases were observed in
nuclear data. Similar results were obtained for absolute
deviations from mean frequency for individual nucleotides as well as combinations of nucleotides (Figure 6b).
For pyrimidines (cytosine and thymine), Ampharetidae
and Alvinellidae deviated more from the mean than
other terebelliform taxa. In addition, Ampharetidae also
showed a much stronger deviation from the mean in
guanine. Binning nucleotides as AT and GC did not
alleviate these differences in deviation (and even made it
more pronounced for Alvinellidae), but recoding pyrimidines (Y) and purines (R) reduced the biases between
terebelliform taxa (Figure 6b).
Ampharetidae exhibited a strong G-C skew value
towards guanine relative to cytosine (Figure 6c). Moreover for mitochondrial data, C-T skews indicated that
Ampharetidae was biased towards thymine, and Alvinellidae away from it, relative to other taxa. The same pattern could be observed in A-T skews driven by the
differences in thymine frequencies. Thus, Ampharetidae
and Alvinellidae showed strong-but opposite-biases in
frequencies of pyrimidines, and Ampharetidae also a
strong skew towards guanine. These evaluations were
based on the mitochondrial dataset, we used for phylogenetic analyses (i.e., excluding 3rd positions), but examining either 3 rd positions alone or with 3 rd positions
included resulted in similar patterns (Additional File 4).

positions consistent with the TriAA or TerAA hypothesis are either noisy only in the outgroup (dark grey in
Figure 4) or in both ingroup and outgroup (light grey in
Figure 4), with more positions belonging to the latter
class. Conversely, positions consistent with the TriTer
hypothesis are exclusively based on a single class of
positions, noisy in the outgroup only (Figure 4).

Amelioration of Incongruence
Non-stationary sequence evolution

Using models of non-stationary sequence evolution has
successfully ameliorated misleading effects of compositional biases in mitochondrial genomes of beetles [60].
Therefore, we also employed such models for both our
mitochondrial and nuclear datasets using PHASE 2.0
[40]. For both datasets and each number of different
compositional vectors, 4 independent chains starting
from different random seeds failed to converge upon the
same score indicating a structured tree-space with several local optima. Nonetheless for mitochondrial data,
the majority-rule consensus topology derived from the
best run (i.e, -lnL values) for each number of different
compositional vectors (i.e., 3, 6, or 9) were identical
except for the position of the outgroup taxon Clymenella torquata (Additional File 5). As before with mitochondrial data, Terebellidae and Trichobranchidae were
sister to each other (PP: 1.00 for all three; Additional
File 5). For nuclear data, the three topologies derived
from the best runs invoking 3, 6 or 9 different vectors
placed Trichobranchidae as sister to Alvinellidae/
Ampharetidae (PP: 1.00 for all three; Additional File 5).
Thus, using different compositional vectors along the
branches did not reduce incongruence between datasets.
RY coding

For mitochondrial genomes, RY coding strategies can
ameliorate biases within pyrimidines and purines, because
they do not distinguish between transition or transversion

classes [15,61]. The best ML tree based on RY coding of
the nuclear partition (Figure 7) is similar to the ML tree
using standard nucleotide coding (Figure 2a; with the
exception of Scoloplos cf. armiger/Orbinia latreillii placement). However, bootstrap support for Trichobranchidae
as sister to Alvinellidae/Ampharetidae dropped.
In contrast, RY coding of the mitochondrial partition
and combined dataset (inset in Figure 7) yielded different
ingroup relationships (see Figures 2b &2c for standard
nucleotide coding) with Terebellidae as sister to Ampharetidae/Alvinellidae rather than Trichobranchidae. Notably,
bootstrap support for this clade was below 50 in the analyses of both mitochondrial and combined data and all
previous topology tests clearly rejected this relationship
(Figures 3b &3c). Besides this difference in ingroup relationships, RY coding of mitochondrial and combined data
also differed in several outgroup relationships.

Discussion
Biases in nucleotide frequencies influenced placement of
Trichobranchidae and Terebellidae in both mitochondrial and combined analyses. Misplacement of these
taxa is interesting because the taxa themselves did not
exhibit compositional biases, but Alvinellidae and
Ampharetidae biases influenced their placement. This
misplacement was apparently due to biases in Ampharetidae and Alvinellidae and can be related to the “symplesiomorphy trap” for which few molecular examples have
been elucidated [16,17]. In the Cirripedia example by
Wägele and Mayer [17] (Figure 1B), Acrothoracica and
Ascothoracida grouped together due to symplesiomorphic characters because of the long branch uniting
the remaining Cirripedia. Though no long branches

could be observed in our analyses based on mitochondrial data regarding terebelliform taxa, biases in base
composition and codon usage detected in Ampharetidae
and Alvinellidae pointing in opposite directions appear
to have had a similar effect. These directional biases
affected nucleotides in all three coding positions of
mitochondrial genes in Ampharetidae and Alvinellidae
presumably due to differences in substitution rate or
pattern.
In our case the symplesiomorphy trap appears to have
misrooted a terebelliform subtree rendering a paraphyletic assemblage as a monophyletic group. The misinterpretation appears due to basal homologies, or
symplesiomorphies, rather than an artificial signal due
to homoplasy (e.g., long branches). First of all, though
Alvinellidae and Ampharetidae are affected by opposite
biases in mitochondrial nucleotide frequencies their sistergroup relationship, which is independently confirmed

by the nuclear data, is still strongly supported by mitochondrial data as judged by bootstrap and spectral analyses. Hence, these two taxa appear unaffected by the
opposite biases. Second, we could exclude that the
nuclear partition is affected by an artificial signal; the
nuclear data exhibited no biases with respect to terebelliform taxa. The root of the subtree comprising Terebellidae, Trichobranchidae and Ampharetidae/Alvinellidae,
which was supported by all our analyses as well as several previous ones [e.g., [19,57,62]], was not placed differently by the inclusion or exclusion of taxa [56].
Moreover, the spectral analysis of the nuclear partition
is in agreement with the reconstructed nodes regarding
the relations of these three taxa to each other. The
number of supporting positions in the spectral analysis
is in agreement with support by bootstrap and topology
test p values for nuclear data. Third and contrasting
with the nuclear data, the spectral analyses of the

Zhong et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:369

mitochondrial data are not congruent with tree reconstructions. Whereas the TriTer hypothesis was recovered in all best trees that included mtDNA data and was
strongly supported by bootstrap and topology test
results, spectral analyses revealed that this hypothesis
was consistent with the fewest numbers of positions in
the mitochondrial data. Using mitochondrial data, these
characters overwhelmed the larger numbers of positions
supporting
the
alternative
placement
of
Trichobranchidae.
In the case of the symplesiomorphy trap, the phylogenetic signal for a certain relationship can be eroded
along internal branches leading to subgroups without
affecting the subgroups themselves. In the Cirripedia
example [17], this erosion occurred along the branch
leading to all Cirripedia but Acrothoracica (Figure 1B).
In our case, there are more possibilities; the branch
leading to Ampharetidae/Alvinellidae as well as the
branches within this clade could be relevant. For the
Terebellidae/Trichobranchidae/Ampharetidae/Alvinellidae clade, differences in substitution processes of Alvinellidae and Ampharetidae obscured signal for this
clade by exhibiting a state different from the apomorphic state of this clade in one or both of these two
taxa (Figure 8). Hence, a large proportion of the data
would still exhibit the original character-state only in
Terebellidae and Trichobranchidae, but not in Ampharetidae/Alvinellidae. As only four character states are
exhibited in nucleotide data and because of skews in
mitochondrial nucleotide frequencies, the likelihood is
high that, in this case, states exhibited in Ampharetidae,
Alvinellidae, or both, are also present in either Terebellidae or Pectinaridae. Accordingly, results of spectral analyses showed that 1) most of the positions in
mitochondrial data supporting the split of Trichobranchidae/Ampharetidae/Alvinellidae are noisy within
ingroup and outgroup, and 2) equal in numbers to the
splits of Terebellidae/Ampharetidae/Alvinellidae and
Pectinaridae/Ampharetidae/Alvinellidae (Figure 4b).

a branch.

support for the sistergroup relationship of Terebellidae
and Trichobranchidae by mitochondrial data is due to
symplesiomorphic characters rather than apomorphic
ones.
The process of deamination of the non-coding strand
may be responsible for biases observed herein for pyrimidines and purines [55]. Compositional biases in our
mitochondrial data were greater within pyrimidines than
in purines; guanine had the lowest average frequency
(16%) of all nucleotides. This is similar to the situation
found in mammals though their guanine frequency can
be considerably lower [15,55,63,64]. In mammals, this is
due to spontaneous deamination of cytosine to uracil
and adenine to hypoxanthine on the complementary
strand during replication of mitochondrial genomes
[55]. The former deamination occurs more often than
the latter [65] explaining the low level of guanines in
mammals on the coding strand and the stronger bias
observed in pyrimidines than in purines, because the
low guanine frequency allows for little variation [15].
The best strategy to ameliorate the effect of the symplesiomorphy trap is to increase ingroup taxon sampling [17]. However, increasing the taxon sampling
might not always be easily achieved or possible. For
example, sampling of nearly complete mitochondrial
genomes in annelids is time consuming and expensive,
but new sequencing technologies are changing this. In
other cases, taxon sampling will be limited by number
of extant taxa from which genetic material can be
obtained. Therefore, we tested different strategies with
respect to their capabilities to ameliorate the effect of
the symplesiomorphy trap given a limited taxon sampling. In the Cirripedia example, using appropriate
methods such as ML and increased outgroup sampling
ameliorated the symplesiomorphy problem because
this misplacement was due to long branches [66]. In
the Mammalia example, the problem could be solved
by the RY coding strategy and partitioned analyses,
which resulted in weak support for the Theria hypothesis even using mitochondrial data [15]. Moreover,
usage of non-stationary models of sequence evolution
were able to adjust for compositional biases in mitochondrial genomes in the reconstruction of the beetle
phylogeny [60].
In our case, the most effective strategy was RY coding,
which reduced the effects of compositional biases within
pyrimidines and purines. However, we still did not
recover strong support for Trichobranchidae as sister to
Ampharetidae/Alvinellidae with either mitochondrial or
combined data. Moreover, phylogenetic signal in all
datasets was substantially decreased by RY coding. Addition of nuclear data was only able to slightly minimize
the effects of the symplesiomorphy trap as indicated, for
example, by the slight decrease in bootstrap support for

the presumed ‘incorrect’ hypothesis. Therefore, substantially more unbiased nuclear data would have been
necessary to turn the tides. On the other hand, herein
partitioned analyses always obtained the same topology
as non-partitioned ML analyses, and PHASE analyses
did not resolve incongruence either. The poor performance of non-stationary models of sequence evolution
in our analyses, in comparison to Sheffield et al. [60],
might be due to the limited sampling of ingroup taxa.
Increased sampling may allow better adjustment to
biases along the branches [58,59]. Finally, we also tested
if exclusion of biased taxa in turn would alter the results
[56], but there was no noticeable effect. Thus, though
several approaches were tried, none completely ameliorated the influence of the symplesiomorphy trap.
Interestingly, results based on combined data seem to
be congruent with morphological and mitochondrial
gene order data and, therefore, the underlying incongruence in the data was not apparent at first. Trichobranchidae strongly resemble Terebellidae and, thus, were
placed as sister to or within Terebellidae [18,20,67].
However, only one non-homoplastic character supports
their common origin: prostomium on peristomium with
fused frontal edges. In contrast, others did not support a
sister relationship of Terebellidae and Trichobranchidae
[68,69]. The position of two adjacent trnM genes also
seemed to support such a relationship of Terebellidae
and Trichobranchidae [23]. However, two adjacent trnM
genes are also found in the pectinarid P. gouldi (Additional File 1) and in some but not all sipunculids
[70-72]. Thus, no unequivocal character supports a sistergroup relationship of Terebellidae and Trichobranchidae. Analyses herein revealed that support by
mitochondrial and combined data was only due to symplesiomorphic characters. On the other hand, although
a close relationship between alvinellids and ampharetids
has been long suspected based on morphology [e.g.,
[18,69,73]], until now strong support by molecular data
[e.g., [19,68]] has been lacking.

Conclusions
Herein we report the detection of the symplesiomorphy
trap in molecular data, one of a few known examples to
date. Mitochondrial data placed Trichobranchidae as sister to Terebellidae in contrast to the nuclear data, which
placed Trichobranchidae as sister to Ampharetidae and
Alvinellidae. These latter two taxa exhibited strong compositional biases in the mitochondrial data as shown by
spectral analyses as well as skew and RCFV values.
However, Ampharetidae and Alvinellidae themselves
were not misplaced but caused Trichobranchidae to be
erroneously placed. This taxon exhibits no obvious compositional bias. Unfortunately, several state-of-the-art
approaches (i.e., partitioning the dataset, performing ML

Page 13 of 15

analyses and partitioned analyses, use of several outgroup taxa, exclusion of biased taxa, use of different
numbers of compositional vectors to implement timeheterogeneous models) were not able to ameliorate the
influence of the symplesiomorphy trap in the mitochondrial data. Therefore, more sophisticated substitution
models have to be developed to appropriately address
this peculiar tree reconstruction artifact. In the mean
time, partitioned and careful analyses can be used to
detect the trap and to be aware of incongruencies in the
molecular data even if nodal support is high as in our
case. Given the advent of next generation sequencing
technologies, we hope that analyses, such as those done
here, will be better able to detect artifacts due to systematic errors because much more data will be brought
to bear on such issues. Hence, these approaches may
add strength and confidence to results of phylogenomic
studies by allowing more in depth understanding of the
sources of signal and noise.
