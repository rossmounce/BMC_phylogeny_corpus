Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arbovirus transmitted by mosquitoes isolated for the first time in Zika forest, Uganda
in 1947 and repeatedly isolated in sub-Saharan Africa
and South East Asia. Until 2000, only few human cases
were reported but in 2007, the first major human outbreak was notified in Yap Island, Micronesia leading to
99 cases. Despite the widespread distribution of Zika
virus, very limited information is available on the genetic
relationship between the circulating strains. Therefore,
we undertook a study on phylogeny and phylodynamics
ZIKV in Africa and Asia. Partial and full length genome
sequences of 38 strains from Senegal, Ivory Coast,
Burkina Faso, Central African Republic and Malaysia
were analysed. Phylogenetic reconstructions and datation were performed while recombination and viral
population migrations were investigated. Phylogenetic
analysis of the E, NS5 and NS5/3’NC gene showed two
distinct ZIKV lineages circulating in Africa and a third
lineage formed by the Micronesia and Malaysia strains.
Besides, analysis of full length genome sequence allows
identification of 5 recombinants isolates in Senegal and
Ivory Coast. The 3 gene regions sequences evolved at a
average rate of 7.74 x 10-4 nucleotide substitutions per
site per year. Using the same analysis, we inferred that
the most recent common ancestor of all ZIKV samples
could be trace 325 years ago. The virus may have
arrived in West Africa around 300 years before the present. And the migration rates showed considerable
movements of ZIKV between Senegal to Ivory Coast
and also to the other countries of East and central
Africa. In conclusion, our study confirms previous
observations showing divergences between Africa ZIKV
isolate from Asia and the evidence of recombinants

strains. Asian strains may represent a divergent lineage
related to a common ancestor with spread throughout
Southeast Asia and the Pacific from Africa.
