Resurrection of an ancestral 5S rRNA
Qing Lu and George E Fox*

Abstract
Background: In addition to providing phylogenetic relationships, tree making procedures such as parsimony and
maximum likelihood can make specific predictions of actual historical sequences. Resurrection of such sequences
can be used to understand early events in evolution. In the case of RNA, the nature of parsimony is such that
when applied to multiple RNA sequences it typically predicts ancestral sequences that satisfy the base pairing
constraints associated with secondary structure. The case for such sequences being actual ancestors is greatly
improved, if they can be shown to be biologically functional.
Results: A unique common ancestral sequence of 28 Vibrio 5S ribosomal RNA sequences predicted by parsimony
was resurrected and found to be functional in the context of the E. coli cellular environment. The functionality of
various point variants and intermediates that were constructed as part of the resurrection were examined in detail.
When separately introduced the changes at single stranded positions and individual double variants at base-paired
positions were also viable. An additional double variant was examined at a different base-paired position and it
was also valid.
Conclusions: The results show that at least in the case of the 5S rRNAs considered here, ancestors predicted by
parsimony are likely to be realistic when the prediction is not overly influenced by single outliers. It is especially
noteworthy that the phenotype of the predicted ancestors could be anticipated as a cumulative consequence of
the phenotypes of the individual variants that comprised them. Thus, point mutation data is potentially useful in
evaluating the reasonableness of ancestral sequences predicted by parsimony or other methods. The results also
suggest that in the absence of significant tertiary structure constraints double variants that preserve pairing in stem
regions will typically be accepted. Overall, the results suggest that it will be feasible to resurrect additional
meaningful 5S rRNA ancestors as well as ancestral sequences of many different types of RNA.

Background
The principle of parsimony suggests that the most likely
evolutionary path between two points in a sequence
space is the one which requires the least number of
events. Although parsimony is primarily used to construct phylogenetic trees, it and other methods such as
maximum likelihood, also provides predictions of ancestral sequences. Traditionally these were ignored. This
began to change with the demonstration that parsimony
predictions of ancestral sequences on a viral system of
known genetic history were largely correct [1]. Subsequently, there has been an increasing interest in what
ancestral sequences might reveal about ancient macromolecules [2]. Thus, soon thereafter parsimony analysis

was applied to reconstruct the evolutionary history of
the artiodactyl ribonuclease superfamily using sequence
data [3]. The resurrection of ancestral proteins and
viruses [4,5] coupled with demonstration of functionality
is now increasingly common and such studies are providing important insights to molecular evolution [6-8].
The primary focus of ancient sequence resurrection
has been proteins [9,10] but the increasing realization
that RNA played a key role in the early history of life
and is intimately involved in the regulation of gene
expression suggests that resurrection of ancient RNAs
will likely be informative too [11]. Of particular interest
is the ribosome whose history is closely intertwined with
the early history of living systems [12-15]. Functional
RNAs such as the ribosomal RNA, (rRNA), typically
have complex secondary and tertiary structures that

must be preserved over evolutionary time to facilitate
function.
5S rRNA is the smallest RNA component of the large
ribosomal subunit and typically contains approximately
120 nucleotides. Its secondary structure [16,17] is
known and in the case of Escherichia coli its tertiary
structure in the context of the ribosome is also available
[18]. In an earlier investigation, all the sequences along
the equally and most parsimonious paths between two
pairs of modern 5S rRNA sequences were examined
[19]. Each intermediate sequence was tested for validity
as a functional 5S rRNA and it was thereby shown that
some of the intermediates were not functional. Thus,
some evolutionary paths through the sequence space are
preferable to others despite the fact that all appear to be
equally parsimonious. In order to be useful, methods for
constructing ancestral sequences should to the extent
possible avoid producing nodal sequences that are not
biologically functional and hence are unlikely to have
existed in the past. Fortunately, the usual parsimony
procedure will automatically conserve sequence correlations between pairs of positions and hence the predicted
nodal sequences will usually satisfy secondary structure
requirements. Thus, there is good reason to anticipate
that many nodal sequences will be functionally valid.
Herein, we successfully test this conjecture by resurrecting an ancestral 5S rRNA sequence that is predicted by
parsimony and showing that it is in fact a functional 5S
rRNA.

Methods
The experimental system employed here utilizes a plasmid encoded 5S rRNA derived from the marine bacterium Vibrio proteolyticus that is expressed in an E. coli
host. This 5S rRNA was initially chosen because its 5’
and 3’ terminal sequence regions are identical in
sequence to those of E. coli 5S rRNA. The plasmid used,
pCV251, was derived from a plasmid pKK5-1 [20],
which carries a large portion of the E. coli rrnB operon.
Additional file 1, Figure S1 illustrates the composition
of plasmids pKK5-1 and pCV251. Plasmid pCV251 has
two ribosomal RNA promoters, P1 and P2, a small fragment of the 16S rRNA sequence, a chemically synthesized V. proteolyticus 5S rRNA gene and the two rrnB
terminators, T1 and T2 [21]. Thus, the V. proteolyticus
5S rRNA is surrounded exclusively by E. coli sequences
thereby ensuring that all signals for correct transcription, processing, and maturation of variants of the V.
proteolyticus 5S rRNA in E. coli are present. The validity
of the V. proteolyticus 5S rRNA sequence and its variants is tested in the E. coli cellular context. There are
two major assays employed for this purpose. One is an
assay that allows determination of the quantitative level
of each variant in three cellular fractions; e.g., total 5S

Page 2 of 8

rRNA, 50S ribosomal subunits, and 70S ribosomes. The
other assay is a competitive growth rate assay that competes each variant with a strain carrying the wild-type V.
proteolyticus 5S rRNA. The V. proteolyticus 5S rRNA
has previously been shown to be expressed to significant
levels and incorporated into ribosomes without significant detriment to growth [22]. If a variant is not functional, it will either be excluded from active ribosomes
or if incorporated into large numbers of ribosomes, substantially impact cell growth rate.
The parsimony algorithm (PHYLIP version 3.5) available in GDE (Genetic Data Environment) [23] was used
to construct phylogenetic trees for 32 V. proteolyticus
5S rRNA sequences [24]. Bacillus subtilis 5S rRNA was
used as the outgroup sequence. DNAPARS, estimates
phylogenies by the parsimony method using nucleic acid
sequences and actually provides predicted sequences at
each node on the phylogenetic tree.
Escherichia coli strain JM109 was used for the growth
of bacteriophage M13. E. coli HB101 was used for rRNA
preparation and in growth rate assays as lac- control. E.
coli ML401 was used in growth rate assay as a lac+ competing test strain. The E. coli TG1 strain was supplied
with Sculptor™in vitro mutagenesis system (Amersham
Life Science Corp.) for the mutagenesis reactions. V.
proteolyticus ATCC15338 carried the wild-type 5S
rRNA. Plasmids pKK5-1 and pCV251 carry the E. coli
5S rRNA gene and V. proteolyticus 5S rRNA gene
respectively [21].
All newly described Vibrio 5S rRNA variants were
constructed by in vitro mutagenesis using the manufacturer’s protocol provided with the Sculptor™mutagenesis kit. The mutants were verified by dideoxynucleotide
sequencing. Each V. proteolyticus 5S rRNA variant was
cloned into pKK5-1 using the HindIII sites, and subsequently transformed into E. coli strain JM109.
Total cellular RNA was isolated by low-pH phenol
extraction [25]. Ribosomes were separated by sucrose
gradient method [26]. The ribosomal subunits, 70S ribosomes, and polyribosomes were separated by ultracentrifugation at 160,000 × g at 0°C for 4 hours using a
Beckman SW41 Ti swinging bucket rotor. After ultracentrifugation, all gradients were analyzed at 280 nm
using an LKB detector (BROMMA) Model 2112
REDIRAC fraction collector. Fractions containing 70S
ribosomes, 50S ribosomal subunits and 30S ribosomal
subunits were prepared individually, followed by ethanol
precipitation, and phenol/chloroform extraction.
The extent of RNA incorporation into various ribosome fractions was examined. To this end, 5S rRNAs
from V. proteolyticus and E. coli were purified respectively from their total RNAs by electrophoresis on two
individual 10% polyacrylamide gels [21]. The concentration of purified 5S rRNA was measured by Stratagene’s

EAGLE EYE™II after running on an agarose gel. Northern Blotting was performed by generating a standard
13% polyacrylamide gel, which was loaded with V. proteolyticus and E. coli 5S rRNA in various calculated
ratios. The RNA was then transferred from the gel to a
charged nylon filter-Hybond™-N+ (Amersham), which
would be first hybridized with a probe (HV2) complementary to V. proteolyticus 5S rRNA. The relative gel
band density, which reflects radioactivity, was measured
using a phosphoimaging system (Fuji, BAS-MP). The
Macintosh program MacBas Version 2.1 was used to
process the data. Subsequently, the filter was stripped
completely before hybridizing a second probe (HE2)
complementary to E. coli. The V. proteolyticus specific
probe used (HV2, 5’-GTCCAAATCGCTATGGTTGC3’) exhibits seven nucleotide differences relative to the
E. coli specific probe (HE2, 5’-GACCACCGCGCTACTGCCGC-3’) that targets the same region of 5S
rRNA., This level of difference ensures hybridization to
V. proteolyticus 5S rRNA without cross hybridization to
the host E. coli 5S rRNA [19]. Both HV2 and HE2
probes were [g-32P]-ATP end-labeled. Once the radioactivity of each band from the standard gel was measured,
a standard curve relating the 5S rRNA concentration
ratio to probe intensity ratio of V. proteolyticus versus E.
coli was constructed. The amount of each V. proteolyticus variant in a sample can be obtained relative to E.
coli, e.g. as a ratio, by comparing the V. proteolyticus
variant band density with those obtained on the standard curve. Probes HV2 and HE2 were used in this
manner to quantify each variant of the V. proteolyticus
5S rRNA in 50S subunits, 70S ribosomes, and total 5S
rRNA. 5S rRNA is not present in the 30S subunits.
Competition growth assays were used to compare the
growth rate of the strain carrying each variant 5S rRNA
relative to a strain carrying the wild-type V. proteolyticus
5S rRNA. E. coli strains HB101 and ML401 were transformed with unmodified pCV251 (control) and pCV251
carrying the variant 5S rRNA instead of the wild type V.
proteolyticus 5S rRNA (test). The growth rate difference
was measured by following the ratio of cell numbers
between the Lac - HB101 (control) and Lac + ML401
(test) when mixed cultures were grown on indicator
plates [27-31].
Growth rate assays were initiated by inoculating each
strain from single colonies into 10 ml of LB medium
containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and growing at 37°C for
approximately 12 hours. Subsequently, the mixture of
two strains was diluted to 10 -3 in M9 media. Two
sequential subcultures were grown. Samples were taken
from each subculture, serially diluted, and plated on
MacConkey indicator agar. After incubation at 37°C for
24 hours, Lac - and Lac+ colonies were scored on the
basis of colony color (Lac - : white, Lac + : pink). The

Page 3 of 8

growth rate difference or selection coefficient (s) was
calculated according to the following equation [26].
In[Np (t) /Nr (t)] = In[Np (0) /Nr (0)] + st

where Np(t) and Nr(t) represent the relative number of
the two competing strains at time t (hr) and s is a measure of differential growth rate (or selection coefficient)
per unit time between the two strains. The strain designated by Np is favored, neutral, or disfavored relative to
the strain designated by Nr as s > 0, s = 0, or s < 0. A
parallel experiment was performed with the strains carrying the test and control reversed.

Results
One hundred phylogenetic trees were constructed from
the Vibrio 5S rRNA dataset using parsimony. Two
ancestral nodal sequences, at node 1 and node 2, were
chosen for experimental study. The sequences at both
nodes were unambiguous and consistently predicted in
all 100 trees. Figure 1 is a randomly chosen representative tree. There are 7 sequence differences between the
modern V. proteolyticus 5S rRNA sequence and ancestral node 1. The base changes at node 1 are A19U,
U21G, U52A, A62C, U64A, U65C, and U88C as indicated on Figure 2. Of these changes, five involve positions involved in secondary structure. Thus, the 21/62
combination converts a UA pairing to a GC pairing, the
19/64 combination converts an AU pair to a UA pair
and the change at position 65 converts a GU wobble
pair to a Watson-Crick GC pair. In addition to the 7
changes in node 4, an eighth change, C70U, which is in
a hairpin loop region, produces the node 2 ancestral
sequence.
A previously constructed plasmid, [19], was used as
the starting point for the mutagenesis because it already
had three of the required base changes, A19U, U52A,
and U64A. This plasmid produces an RNA that is functional in the E. coli cellular context. A series of consecutive mutagenesis reactions were performed to construct
the final two plasmids carrying the complete node 1 and
node 2 sequences. This mutagenesis process resulted in
the formation of two intermediates sequences. Relative
to the V. proteolyticus wild type 5S rRNA, the first intermediate had changes A19U, U21G, U52A, and U64A,
while the second had changes A19U, U21G, U52A,
A62C, U64A, and U65C. In addition to the two ancestral nodal sequences and the two intermediate
sequences, two single point mutations (G33C and
C49G) and one double mutant (G33C; C49G) were
made in the work described here. Positions 33 and 49
are pairing partners in a duplex region of 5S rRNA and
are not associated with the resurrection. After mutagenesis, each variant was confirmed by DNA sequencing
and cloned into the expression vector as described in

the methods. Table 1 shows the results of quantization
and growth rate analysis for these seven mutants. In
addition, eleven other relevant variants have been previously studied [19,32] and are included in Table 1.
None of the constructs had a substantial affect on the
growth of the host strain. However, by examining the
accumulation levels of each construct in the total RNA
pool and the various ribosome fractions each construct
can be classified into one of three major categories
referred to as green, red and blue. The green variants
are considered to be functional. They are extensively

accumulated and incorporated into 50S ribosomal subunits and 70S ribosomes without significant detrimental
effect on cell growth rate. The red variants are extensively accumulated in the total 5S rRNA pool but not
significantly incorporated into 50S ribosomal subunits
or 70S ribosomes. These variants are considered to be
non-functional. The blue variants such as A19U accumulate poorly in the total 5S rRNA pool, apparently
because the RNA has become unstable. Typically, these
variants are expected to be non-functional but in some
cases they may actually be functional as they are

observed to accumulate at low but nevertheless similar
levels in 50S ribosomal subunits and 70S ribosomes.
The single base change variant C70U is an example of a
blue variant of this type.
The node 1 sequence, which is the predicted common
ancestor of 28 Vibrio 5S rRNAs, was in the green category and can therefore be considered to be a valid 5S
rRNA. Likewise all the intermediates that did not disrupt secondary structure were also found to be functional in the E. coli context. The additional base change
required to create the node 2 sequence resulted in loss
of stability such that it was not possible to unambiguously determine whether this nodal sequence would be
functional or non-functional, if it accumulated at higher
levels. However, it is best concluded that this nodal
sequence is likely not a valid ancestor.

Discussion
It is inherent in the concept of an ancestral sequence
that a true ancestor would have been functional in the
cellular context that existed at the time. Thus, if a predicted ancestor when resurrected is functional in the
modern cellular context, it is far more likely to be a realistic ancestor than one that is not. One can argue that
viability of a true ancestor might be lost following resurrection due to changes in the cellular context. In the
present instance, we believe this is unlikely to be the
case. In prior work, [22] the wildtype sequences of ten
different species of modern Vibrio 5S rRNAs were tested
for functionality in the E. coli cellular environment. All,
were accumulated in ribosomes without significant

detriment to growth rate (most were actually slightly
favorable) and therefore regarded as functional in the E.
coli cellular environment. The evolutionary distance
between E. coli and any of these 10 Vibrio species
clearly exceeds the distance between the modern Vibrio
5S rRNAs and the ancestors reconstructed here.
The node 1 5S rRNA was found to be functional in
the E. coli cellular context. This RNA has seven base
changes relative to the modern V. proteolyticus 5S
rRNA Given the low probability that this number of
changes could be randomly introduced without disrupting function [33], this should be regarded as a successful
resurrection of a realistic ancestor. Of these changes, all
have previously been studied as individual point mutations, or in the case of those involving base pairing, as
appropriate double mutants, Table 1. When made individually, U52A, U65C and U88C, produced functionally
valid 5S rRNAs. Likewise, when both partners in the 19/
64 and 21/62 base pairs are changed simultaneously, the
resulting 5S rRNA was a functionally valid 5S rRNA.
Thus, the individual changes that comprise the ancestral
sequence all produce valid 5S rRNAs too. This reaffirms
the earlier conclusion [32] that variants which occur frequently in a local region of the 5S rRNA structure space
(these seven do) are largely independent of one another
and hence can occur separately or together in many
sequences, e.g. in this case in the predicted ancestral
sequence without disrupting function.
When only one residue in a base pair was changed, e.
g. A19U or U64A the individual point mutations did
not produce a functional 5S rRNA whereas changing

Lu and Fox BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:218

both positions in unison did. Since single changes are
more likely to occur than double changes one might
expect paired regions to change more slowly than other
regions. However, this need not be the case. It was
found in the earlier pathway studies [16] that one could
bypass the double mutant by making other variants first.
In addition, the success of the three double mutants
examined here in producing valid 5S rRNAs indicates
that there is a very high probability that a double
mutant that preserves secondary structure will be
accepted, if the bases that comprise the pair are not
involved in tertiary interactions. In contrast, a single
mutation in a non-paired region may be significantly
less likely to be accepted. Thus, the overall rate of
acceptance may not be dissimilar even though double
mutants are less common. Also, and perhaps more
importantly, it should be appreciated that one can
potentially transition from one standard pair to another
via a GU wobble or GA intermediary.
Although the node 1 sequence is regarded as a valid
ancestral sequence, a single additional base change,
C70U, made the RNA sequence represented by node 2
unstable. Since the node 2 RNA does not accumulate to
a significant extent and is absent from ribosomes, it is
at best very suspect as a valid ancestor. As a separate
variant, the C70U change alone, Table 1, is also unstable
in the E. coli cellular context. It does, however, accumulate in ribosomes enough to suggest that it is likely
functional, if it can avoid premature degradation. Thus,
the behavior of the multiple variant at node 2 is again
strongly influenced by the behavior of the individual
variants that comprise it.
From the perspective of the present study, the appropriate conclusion is that node 2 is most likely not a valid
ancestor. When one traverses from node 1 to node 2, the
new nodal sequence is based on the addition a single
additional 5S rRNA sequence, Vibrio damsela whose 5S
rRNA has C70U. However, relative to node 2, this 5S
rRNA has three additional base changes, A25U, U35A,
and C88U. Unless it was erroneously determined, the V.
damsela sequence is a valid 5S rRNA. Thus, the comparison suggests that U25, A35, or U88 in some combination
or separately compensate for the negative effect of C70U
in order to make this 5S rRNA functional. The availability of additional sequences related to V. damsela might
have improved the prediction at node 2. The results presented here point out the danger of allowing predictions
to be strongly influenced by a single sequence.

Conclusions
In summary, it has been demonstrated that an ancestral
5S rRNA sequence predicted by parsimony can serve as
a functional RNA and thus can be regarded as

Page 7 of 8

reasonable approximations of a true ancestral sequence.
However, a second predicted ancestral sequence did not
pass the test of convincing functionality. In both cases,
the functional behavior of the ancestral sequence could
be largely anticipated based on the behavior of individual base or base pair changes that comprised the predicted ancestral sequence. A strength of the parsimony
approach in the present context is that by its nature,
meaningful secondary structure will be preserved
because paired positions will typically exhibit co-variation when numbers of sequences are aligned. In the
future, it should be possible to resurrect other 5S rRNA
ancestors as well as other interesting RNAs such interesting regions of the large ribosomal RNAs.
