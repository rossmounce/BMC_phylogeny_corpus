Abstract
Background: Initial interest in Dechloromonas aromatica strain RCB arose from its ability to anaerobically degrade
benzene. It is also able to reduce perchlorate and oxidize chlorobenzoate, toluene, and xylene, creating interest in using
this organism for bioremediation. Little physiological data has been published for this microbe. It is considered to be a
free-living organism.
Results: The a priori prediction that the D. aromatica genome would contain previously characterized "central" enzymes
to support anaerobic aromatic degradation of benzene proved to be false, suggesting the presence of novel anaerobic
aromatic degradation pathways in this species. These missing pathways include the benzylsuccinate synthase (bssABC)
genes (responsible for fumarate addition to toluene) and the central benzoyl-CoA pathway for monoaromatics. In depth
analyses using existing TIGRfam, COG, and InterPro models, and the creation of de novo HMM models, indicate a highly
complex lifestyle with a large number of environmental sensors and signaling pathways, including a relatively large number
of GGDEF domain signal receptors and multiple quorum sensors. A number of proteins indicate interactions with an as
yet unknown host, as indicated by the presence of predicted cell host remodeling enzymes, effector enzymes, hemolysinlike proteins, adhesins, NO reductase, and both type III and type VI secretory complexes. Evidence of biofilm formation
including a proposed exopolysaccharide complex and exosortase (epsH) are also present. Annotation described in this
paper also reveals evidence for several metabolic pathways that have yet to be observed experimentally, including a
sulphur oxidation (soxFCDYZAXB) gene cluster, Calvin cycle enzymes, and proteins involved in nitrogen fixation in other
species (including RubisCo, ribulose-phosphate 3-epimerase, and nif gene families, respectively).
Conclusion: Analysis of the D. aromatica genome indicates there is much to be learned regarding the metabolic
capabilities, and life-style, for this microbial species. Examples of recent gene duplication events in signaling as well as
dioxygenase clusters are present, indicating selective gene family expansion as a relatively recent event in D. aromatica's
evolutionary history. Gene families that constitute metabolic cycles presumed to create D. aromatica's environmental
'foot-print' indicate a high level of diversification between its predicted capabilities and those of its close relatives, A.
aromaticum str EbN1 and Azoarcus BH72.

Background
D. aromatica strain RCB is a gram negative Betaproteobacterium found in soil environments [1]. Other members of
the Betaproteobacteria class are found in environmental
samples (such as soil and sludge) or are pathogens (such
as Ralstonia solanacearum in plants and Neisseria meningitidis in humans) and in general the genus Dechloromonas
has been found to be ubiquitous in the environment.
A facultative anaerobe, D. aromatica was initially isolated
from Potomac River sludge contaminated with BTEX compounds (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene)
based on its ability to anaerobically degrade chlorobenzoate [1]. This microbe is capable of aromatic hydrocarbon degradation and perchlorate reduction, and can
oxidize Fe(II) and H2S [2]. Although several members of
the Rhodocyclales group of Betaproteobacteria are of
interest to the scientific community due to their ability to
anaerobically degrade derivatives of benzene, D. aromatica
is the first pure culture capable of anaerobic degradation
of the stable underivitized benzene molecule to be isolated. This, along with its ability to reduce perchlorate (a
teratogenic contaminant introduced into the environment by man) and inquiry into its use in biocells [3] has
led to interest in using this organism for bioremediation
and energy production. Since the isolation of D. aromatica, other species of Azoarcus have been found to possess
the ability to anaerobically degrade benzene, but have not
been genomically sequenced [4].
The pathway for anaerobic benzene degradation has been
partially deduced [5], but the enzymes responsible for this
process have yet to be identified, and remain elusive even
after the intensive annotation efforts described here-in.
Conversely, central anaerobic pathways for aromatic compounds described in various other species were not found
to be present in this genome [6].

Methods
Sequencing
Three libraries (3 kb, 8 kb and 30 kb) were generated by
controlled shearing (Hydroshear, Genomic Solutions,
Ann Arbor, MI) of spooled genomic DNA isolated from D.
aromatica strain RCB and inserted into pUC18,
pCUGIblu21, and pcc1Fos vectors, respectively. Clonal
DNA was amplified using rolling circular amplification
http://www.jgi.doe.gov/ and sequenced on ABI 3700 capillary DNA sequencers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA) using BigDye technology (Perkin Elmer Corporation,
Waltham, MA). Paired end-reads [7] were used to aid in
assembly, and proved particularly useful in areas of
repeats.

The Phrap algorithm [8,9] was used for initial assembly.
Finishing and manual curation was conducted on

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/351

CONSED v14 software [10], supplemented with a suite of
finishing analysis tools provided by the Joint Genome
Institute. In silico cross-over errors were corrected by manual creation of fake reads to guide the assembly by forcing
the consensus to follow the correct path.
Gaps were closed through a combination of primer walks
on the gap-spanning clones from the 3 and 8 kb libraries
(identified by paired-end analysis in the CONSED software) as well as sequencing of mapped, unique PCR products from freshly prepared genomic DNA.
The final step required to create a finished single chromosomal sequence was to determine the number of tandem
repeats for a 672 base DNA sequence of unknown length.
This was done by creating the full tandem repeat insert
from unique upstream and downstream primers using
long-range PCR. We then determined the size of product
(amplified DNA) between the unique sequences.
Protein sequence predictions/orfs
Annotation done at Oak Ridge National Laboratory consisted of gene calls using CRITICA [11], glimmer [12], and
Generation http://compbio.ornl.gov/. Annotation at the
Virtual Institute for Microbial Stress and Survival http://
www.microbesonline.org used bidirectional best hits as
well as recruitment to TIGRfam hidden Markov models
(HMMs), as described in Alm et al. [13]. Briefly, protein
coding predictions derived from NCBI, or identified using
CRITICA, with supplemental input from Glimmer, were
analyzed for domain identities using the models deposited in the InterPro, UniProt, PRODOM, Pfam, PRINTS,
SMART, PIR SuperFamily, SUPERFAMILY, and TIGRfam
databases [13]. Orthologs were identified using bidirectional unique best hits with greater than 75% coverage.
RPS-BLAST against the NCBI COGs (Clusters of Orthologous Genes) in the CDD database were used to assign proteins to COG models when the best hit E-value was <1e-5
and coverage was >60%.
Manual curation
Each and every predicted protein in the VIMSS database
http://www.microbesonline.org[13] was assessed to compare insights obtained from recruitment to models from
several databases (TIGRfams, COGs, EC and InterPro).
Assignments that offered the most definitive functional
assignment were captured in an excel spreadsheet with
data entries for all proteins predicted in the VIMSS database. Extensive manual curation of the predicted protein
set was carried out using a combination of tools including
the VIMSS analysis tools, creation and assessment of
HMMs, and phylogenomic analysis, as described [see
Additional files 1, 2]. Changes in gene functional predictions and naming were captured in the excel spreadsheet,
and predictions with strong phylogenetic evidence of

function posted using the interactive VIMSS web-based
annotation interface.
Phylogenomic analysis: Flower Power, SCI PHY and HMM
scoring
Hidden Markov models were generated for a large subset
of proteins of interest, as detailed [see Additional file 1],
to predict functional classification with the highest confidence measures currently available. The HMMs allowed
recruitment of proteins to phylogenetic tree alignments
that most closely reflect evolutionary relatedness across
species. The proteins were assembled within clades of proteins that are aligned along their full length (no missing
functional domains), and that allow high confidence of
shared function in each species.
Gene Family Expansion
A clustered set of paralogs [see Additional files 1, 2] was
used to search for recent gene duplication events. After an
initial assessment of the VIMSS gene information/
homolog data, candidate proteins were used as seed
sequences for Flower Power and internal tree-viewing
tools or SCI-PHY analyses. These two approaches
employed neighbor-joining trees using the Scoredist correction setting in the Belvu alignment editor, or the SCIPHY utility and tree viewer. In either case resulting phylogenomic tree builds were reviewed, and contiguous protein alignments of two or more proteins from D. aromatica
were considered to be candidates for a gene duplication
event, either in the D. aromatica genome or in a predecessor species.
Resequencing to verify absence of plasmid structure
After finishing the D. aromatica genome, analysis of the
annotated gene set revealed the notable absence of several
anaerobic aromatic degradation pathways that were
expected to be present, due to their presence in A. aromaticum EbN1 (an evolutionary near-neighbor, as determined by 16sRNA phylogeny). Because many catabolic
pathways are encoded on plasmid DNA, we felt it was
important to preclude this possibility. We re-isolated
DNA from a clonal preparation of D. aromatica that experimentally supported anaerobic benzene degradation,
using three different plasmid purification protocols, each
based on different physical parameters. All three generated a single band of DNA. The protocol that generated
the highest yield of DNA was used to create a complete,
new library of 2 kb inserts, and the library was submitted
to sequence analysis using the protocols previously cited.

Results
Overview of Gene and Protein Features
The finished sequence for D. aromatica reveals a single circular, closed chromosome of 4,501,104 nucleotides created from 130,636 screened reads, with an average G+C

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/351

content of 60% and an extremely high level of sequence
coverage (average depth of 24 reads/base [see Additional
file 3]). Specific probing for plasmids confirmed no plasmid structure was present in the clonal species sequenced,
which supports anaerobic benzene degradation. It is
noted however that the presence of two tra clusters (putative conjugal transfer genes; VIMSS582582-582597 and
VIMSS582865-582880), as well as plasmid partitioning
proteins, indicates this microbial species is likely to be
transformationally competent and thus likely to be able to
support plasmid DNA structures.
The Virtual Institute for Microbial Stress and Survival
(VIMSS, http://www.microbesonline.org) and the Joint
Genome
Institute
http://genome.jgi-psf.org/
finished_microbes/decar/decar.home.html report 4170
and 4204 protein coding genes, respectively [see Additional file 3]. Cross-database comparisons were done to
assure the highest probability of capturing candidate orfs
for analysis. The majority of proteins are shared between
data sets. Variations in N-termini start sites were noted,
both between JGI and VIMSS datasets and between initial
and later annotation runs (approximately 200 N-termini
differences between four runs of orf predictions were
noted for the initial two annotation runs, Joint Genome
Institute's, done at Oak Ridge National Laboratories –
ORNL, and VIMSS).
The most definitive functional classification, TIGRfams,
initially defined approximately 10% of the proteins in this
genome; as of this writing, 33% of predicted proteins in
the D. aromatica genome are covered by TIGRfams, leaving 2802 genes with no TIGRfam classification [see Additional file 4]. Many proteins in the current and initial noncovered sets were investigated further using K. Sjölander's
HMM building protocols (many of which are available at
http://phylogenomics.berkeley.edu), to supplement
TIGRfams. The Clusters of Orthologous Genes (COG)
assignments were used for classification in the families of
signaling proteins, but specific function predictions for
these proteins also required further analyses. The metabolic and signaling pathways are discussed below, and the
identity of orthologs within these pathways are based on
analysis of phylogenomic profiles of clusters obtained by
HMM analysis, with comparison to proteins having experimentally defined function.
Anaerobic aromatic degradation – absence of known
enzymes indicates novel pathways
One of the more striking findings is the absence of known
key enzymes for monoaromatic degradation under anaerobic conditions. One of the primary metabolic capabilities of interest for this microbe is anaerobic degradation of
benzene. Fumarate addition to toluene via benzylsuccinate synthase (BssABCD) is recognized as the common

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:351

mechanism for anaerobic degradation by a phylogenomically diverse population of microbes [14-16] and has
been called "the paradigm of anaerobic hydrocarbon oxidation"[17]. Benzoyl CoA is likewise considered a central
intermediate in anaerobic degradation, and is further catabolized via benzoyl CoA reductase (BcrAB) [17]. Populated KEGG maps in the IMG and VIMSS databases, based
on BLAST analyses, indicate the presence of some of the
enzymes previously characterized as belonging to the Bss
pathway in D. aromatica, yet more careful analysis shows
the candidate enzymes to be members of a general family,
rather than true orthologs of the enzymes in question. The
majority of catabolic enzymes of interest for D. aromatica
are not covered by TIGRfams or COGs families. For this
reason Flower Power clustering, SCI-PHY subfamily clade
analysis, and HMM scoring were used to ascertain the
presence or absence of proteins of interest (for a detailed
description, see Additional file 1). The most reliable prediction-of-function
approaches
for
genomically
sequenced protein orfs are obtained using the more computationally intensive HMM modelling and scoring utilities. This allows the protein in question to be assessed by
phylogenetic alignment to protein families or sub-families with experimentally known function, providing much
more accurate predictions [18,19].
To explore the apparent lack of anaerobic aromatic degradation pathways expected to be present in this genome, all
characterized anaerobic aromatic degradation pathways
from A. aromaticum EbN1 [20] were defined by HMMs to
establish presence or absence of proteins in both the D.
aromatica and Azoarcus BH72 genomes (these three
genomes comprise nearest-neighbor species in currently
sequenced species [see Additional file 1]. In A. aromaticum
EbN1, ten major catabolic pathways have been found for
anaerobic aromatic degradation, and nine of the ten converge on benzoyl-CoA [21]. A key catalytic enzyme or subunit for each enzymatic step was used as a seed sequence
to recruit proteins from a non-redundant set of Genbank
proteins for phylogenetic analysis. Benzylsuccinate synthase, present in A. aromaticum EbN1 [20,22] as well as
Thauera aromatica [6], and Geobacter metallireducens [23],
is not present in either the D. aromatica or Azoarcus BH72
genomes (see Table 1). Benzoyl-CoA reductase and benzylsuccinate synthase, previously denoted as "central" to
anaerobic catabolism of aromatics, are likewise absent.
The set of recruited proteins for both benzylsuccinate synthase and benzoyl-CoA reductase indicate they are not as
universally present as has been suggested. D. aromatica
does encode a protein in the pyruvate formate lyase family, but further analysis shows that it is more closely
related to the E. coli homolog of this protein (which is not
involved in aromatic catabolism) than to BssA. Anaerobic
reduction of ethylbenzene is carried out by ethylbenzene
dehydrogenase (EbdABCD1, 2) in A. aromaticum. This

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/351

complex belongs to the membrane bound nitrate reductase (NarDKGHJI) family. In D. aromatica, this complex of
proteins is only present as the enzymatically characterized
perchlorate reductase (PcrABCD; [24]) which utilizes perchlorate, rather than nitrate, as the electron acceptor.
EbdABCD proteins in A. aromaticum (VIMSS814904814907 and VIMSS816928-816931) occur in operons
that include (S)-1-phenylethanol dehydrogenases (Ped;
VIMSS 814903 and 816927) [25], both of which are
absent from D. aromatica, as is the acetophenone carboxylase that catalyzes ATP-dependent carboxylation of acetophonenone produced by Ped.
For all pathways except the ubiquitous phenylacetic acid
catabolic cluster, which is involved in the aerobic degradation of phenylalanine, and the PpcAB phenylphosphate
carboxylase enzymes involved in phenol degradation via
4-hydroxybenzoate, all key anaerobic aromatic degradation proteins present in A. aromaticum EbN1 are missing
from the D. aromatica genome (Table 1), and the majority
are also not present in Azoarcus BH72. The lack of overlap
for genes encoding anaerobic aromatic enzymes between
these two species was completely unexpected, as both A.
aromaticum EbN1 and D. aromatica are metabolically
diverse degraders of aromatic compounds. In general Azoarcus BH72 appears to share many families of proteins
with D. aromatica that are not present in A. aromaticum
EbN1 (eg signaling proteins, noted below).
Anaerobic degradation of benzene occurs at relatively
sluggish reaction rates, indicating that the pathways
incumbent in D. aromatica for aromatic degradation
under anaerobic conditions might serve in a detoxification role. Another intriguing possibility is that oxidation
is dependent on intracellularly produced oxygen, which is
likely to be a rate-limiting step. Alicycliphilus denitrificans
strain BC couples benzene degradation under anoxic conditions with chlorate reduction, utilizing the oxygen produced by chlorite dismutase in conjunction with a
monooxygenase and subsequent catechol degradation for
benzene catabolism [26]. A similar mechanism may
account for anaerobic benzene oxidation coupled to perchlorate and chlorate reduction in D. aromatica. However,
anaerobic benzene degradation coupled with nitrate
reduction is also utilized by this organism, and remains
enigmatic [5].
The extremely high divergence of encoded protein families in this functional grouping differs from the general
population of central metabolic and housekeeping genes:
Azoarcus BH72, Azoarcus aromaticum EbN1 and D. aromatica are evolutionarily near-neighbors within currently
sequenced genomes, as defined both by the high level of
protein similarity within house-keeping genes (defined by
the COG J family of proteins), and 16sRNA sequence. Azo-

BcrADB'C'
Anaerobic aromatic degradation enzymes in near-neighbor Aromatoleum aromaticum EbN1 are largely absent from Azoarcus BH72 and D. aromatica
RCB. Protein profiles (HMMs) were used to detect the presence or absence of anaerobic enzymes involved in degradation of aromatic compounds
in Aromatoleum aromaticum. The last two columns denote presence (+) or absence (-) of homologs in either the Azoarcus BH72 or the D. aromatica
RCB genome of the proteins listed that are present in the A. aromaticum EbN1 genome. The ethylbenzene dehydrogenase molybdenum-containing
enzyme complex (ebdABCD) is described by TIGRfams 3479, 3478 and 3482, which define a type II DMSO reductase family of enzymes that
includes D. aromatica's perchlorate reductase PcrABCD subunits.

arcus BH72 and A. aromaticum EbN1 display the highest
percent similarity between housekeeping proteins within
this triad, with 138 of the 156 COG J proteins in A. aromaticum EbN1 displaying highest similarity to their BH72
counterparts. On average these two genomes display
83.5% amino acid identity across shared COG J proteins.
D. aromatica is an outlier in the triad, with higher similarity to Azoarcus BH72 than A. aromaticum EbN1 (43 of D.
aromatica's 169 COG J proteins are most homologous to
A. aromaticum EbN1 orthologs with an average 71% identity, and 67 are most homologous to Azoarcus BH72 with
an average 72% identity).
Comparative genomics have previously established that
large amounts of DNA present in one species can be
absent even from a different strain within the same species
[27]. In addition, the underestimation of the diversity of
aromatic catabolic pathways (both aerobic and anaerobic) has been noted previously [28], and a high level of
enzymatic diversity has been seen for pathways that have
the same starting and end products, including anaerobic
benzoate oxidation [29].
Aerobic aromatic degradation
D. aromatica encodes several aerobic pathways for aromatic degradation, including six groups of oxygenase clusters that each share a high degree of sequence similarity to
the phenylpropionate and phenol degradation (Hpp and
Mhp) pathways in Comamonas species [30,31]. The mhp
genes of E. coli and Comamonas are involved in catechol
and protocatechuate pathways for aromatic degradation
via hydroxylation, oxidation, and subsequent ring cleavage of the dioxygenated species. Only one of the clusters
in D. aromatica encodes an mhpA-like gene; it begins with
VIMSS584143 MhpC, and is composed of orthologs of
MhpABCDEF&R, and is in the same overall order and orientation as the Comamonas cluster as well as the E. coli mhp
gene families [32] (see Fig. 1, cluster 3). These pathways
are also phylogenomically related to the biphenyl/polychlorinated biphenyl (Bhp) degradation pathways in
Pseudomonad species [32]. For Comamonas testosteroni, this
pathway is thought to be associated with lignin degradation [31]. Hydroxyphenyl propionate (HPP), an alkanoic
acid of phenol, is the substrate for Mhp, and is also pro-

duced by animals in the digestive breakdown of polyphenols found in seed components [33]. Each gene cluster
appears to represent a multi-component pathway, and is
made up of five or more of various combinations of dioxygenase, hydroxylase, aldolase, dehydrogenase, hydratase,
decarboxylase and thioesterase enzymes.
The single predicted MhpA protein in D. aromatica
(VIMSS584155), which is predicted to support an initial
hydroxylation of a substituted phenol substrate, shares
64.4% identity to Rhodococcus OhpB 3-(2-hydroxyphenyl)
propionate monooxygenase (GI:8926385) vs. 26.4% for
Comamonas testosteroni (GI:5689247), yet the remainder
of the ohp genes in the Rodococcus ohp clade do not share
synteny with the D. aromatica mhp gene cluster.
Other aromatic oxygenases
Two chromosomally adjacent monooxygenase clusters,
syntenic to genes found in Burkholderia and Ralstonia spp,
indicate that D. aromatica might have broad substrate
hydroxylases that support the degradation of toluene,
vinyl chlorides, and TCE (Fig. 2 and Table 2), and are thus
candidates for benzene-activating enzymes in the presence of oxygen.

One monooxygenase gene cluster, composed of
VIMSS581514 to 581519 ('tbc2 homologs,' Fig. 2), is
orthologous to the tbuA1UBVA2C/tmoAECDBF/touABCDEF/phlKLMNOP and tbc2ABCDEF gene families (from P.
stutzeri, R. pickettii, and Burkholderia JS150). This gene
cluster includes a transport protein that is orthologous to
TbuX/TodX/XylN (VIMSS581520). Specificity for the initial monooxygenase is not established, but phylogenetic
analysis places VIMSS581514 monooxygenase with nearneighbors TbhA [34], reported as a toluene and aliphatic
carbohydrate monooxygenase (76.5% sequence identity),
and BmoA [35], a benzene monooxygenase of low
regiospecificity (79.6% sequence identity). The high level
of similarity to the D. aromatica protein is notable. The
region is also highly syntenic with, and homologous to,
the tmoAECDBF (AY552601) gene cluster responsible for
P. mendocina's ability to utilize toluene as a sole carbon
and energy source [36].

Aerobic degradation of aromatic compounds: multiple Mhp-like dioxygenase clusters. Each of the six mhp-like
gene clusters in the D. aromatica genome is depicted. Recent gene duplications between individual proteins are shown by a purple connector between duplicates. Naming convention was chosen for simplicity and consistency, and names all proteins paralogous to a given Mhp protein with the Mhp name (MhpABCDEF or R), but does not imply enzymatic specificity for the
substrates listed here-in, though the general enzymatic reaction is highly likely to be conserved. Mhp: meta cleavage of hpp,
(hydroxyphenyl)propionate. MhpA, 3HPP hydroxylase; MhpB, DHPP 1,2-dioxygenase; MhpC, 2-hydroxy-6-ketonona-2,4-dienedioate hydrolase; MhpD, 2, deto-4-pentenoate hydratase; MhpE, 4-hydroxy-2-ketovalerate aldolas; MhpF, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase.

D. aromatica possesses two oxygenase gene clusters that are syntenic to the tbc1 and 2 catabolic gene clusters of Burkholderia
JS150, but with an inversion and insertion in the chromosome. Also shown are the tmo (toluene mono-oxygenase) toluene

of R. eutropha (VIMSS 896207–896222, Burkholderia protein names were used for consistency). The first seven orfs (encoding a
tbc1-like cluster) of R. eutropha JMP134 are orthologous to the PoxABCDEFG (phenol hydroxylase) and P0123456 genes of
Ralstonia sp E2 and R. eutropha H16, respectively. Orthologs can be identified as having the same size and color scheme.

The large cluster of aromatic degradation enzymes in the D. aromatica genome shown includes two mono-oxygenase clusters in a linear array on
the D. aromatica chromosome, with 17 predicted genes intergenically inserted, which encode mhp 'cluster 6' and several predicted signaling
proteins. The second monooxygenase cluster is followed by mhp 'cluster 2' (for an overview of mhp clusters see Fig. 1).

Just downstream on the chromosome is a phc/dmp/phh/
phe/aph-like cluster of genes, composed of the genes
VIMSS812947 and VIMSS 581535 to 581540 ('tbc1
homologs,' Fig. 2). Overall, chromosomal organization is
somewhat different for D. aromatica as compared to Ralstonia and Burkholderia. D. aromatica has a fourteen gene
insert that encodes members of the mhp-like family of aromatic oxygenases between the tandem tbc 1 and 2-like
oxygenase clusters (see Table 2), with an inversion of the
second region compared to R. eutropha and Burkholderia.
Clade analysis indicates a broad substrate phenol degra-

dation pathway in this cluster, with high sequence identity to the TOM gene cluster of Bradyrhizobium, which has
the ability to oxidize dichloroethylene, vinyl chlorides,
and TCE [37,38]. The VIMSS581522 response regulator
gene that occurs between the two identified monooxygenase gene clusters shares 50.3% identity to the Thaurea
aromatica tutB gene and 48.2% to the Pseudomonas sp. Y2
styrene response regulator (occupying the same clade in
phylogenetic analysis). VIMSS581522 is likely to be
involved in the chemotactic response in conjunction with
VIMSS581521 (histidine kinase) and VIMSS581523

(methyl accepting chemotaxis protein), which would confer the ability to display a chemotactic response to aromatic compounds.
Overall, several mono- and di-oxygenases were found in
the genome, indicating D. aromatica has diverse abilities
in the aerobic oxidation of heterocyclic compounds.
There are several gene clusters indicative of benzoate
transport and catabolism. All recognized pathways are
aerobic. The benzoate dioxygenase cluster BenABCDR is
encoded in VIMSS582483-582487, and is very similar to
(and clades with) the xylene degradation (xylXYZ) cluster
of Pseudomonas.
There is also an hcaA oxygenase gene cluster, embedded in
one of the mhp clusters (see cluster 5, Fig. 1). Specificity of
the large subunit of the dioxygenase (VIMSS582049)
appears to be most likely for a bicyclic aromatic compound, as it shows highest identity to dibenzothiophene
and naphthalene dioxygenases.
Dechloromonas aromatica's sensitivity to the
environment
Cell Signaling
D. aromatica has a large number of genes involved in signaling pathways, with 314 predicted signaling proteins
categorized in COG T (signal transduction mechanisms)
and a total of 395 proteins (nearly 10% of the genome)
either recruited to COG T or possessing annotated signal
transduction domains. Signaling appears to be an area
that has undergone recent gene expansion, as nine recent
gene duplication events in this functional group are pre-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/351

dicted by phylogenetic analysis, as described in a later section (shown in Table 3).
Complex lifestyles are implicated in large genomes with
diverse signaling capability, and in general genomes with
a very large number of annotated open reading frames
(orfs) have high numbers of predicted signal transducing
proteins, as shown in Fig. 3, though some species, such as
Rhodococcus RHA1 and Psychroflexus torques are notable
exceptions to this trend. However, assessment of COG T
population size relative to other genomes with a similar
number of predicted orfs (Fig. 3) indicates that D. aromatica is one of a handful of species that have a large relative
number of signaling proteins vs similarly sized genomes.
Other organisms displaying this characteristic include
Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum MS-1, Stigmatella aurantiaca, Myxococcus Xanthus DK1622, Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1, Oceanospirillum sp. MED92, and
Desulfuromonas acetoxidans. Within the Betaproteobacteria, Chromobacterium violaceum and Thiobacillus denitrificans have a relatively large number of signaling cascade
genes, but still have far fewer than found in D. aromatica,
with 262 predicted COG T proteins (6% of the genome)
and 137 COG T proteins (4.8% of the genome), respectively. Histidine kinase encoding proteins are particularly
well-represented, with only Stigmatella aurantiaca DW4/31, Magnetococcus sp. MC-1, Myxococcus xanthus DK 1622,
and Nostoc punctiforme reported as having more. The sixtyeight annotated histidine kinases include a large number
of nitrate/nitrogen responsive elements. Furthermore, the
presence of 47 putative histidine kinases predicted to contain two transmembrane (TM) domains, likely to encode
membrane-bound sensors (see Fig. 4), suggests that D.

Proteins within the genome that show evidence of possible recent gene duplication are tabulated by general functional group, or, in some cases,
specific proteins (NapH, NosZ, FlhCD, Nitrogen regulatory protein PII). Duplicates and triplicates were determined by adjacent clustering of the D.
aromatica proteins in a phylogenomic tree profile. The percent identity between the D. aromatica duplicate and triplicate candidates is higher than
identity to other species' protein candidates, indicating a possible gene family expansion event. Areas of duplicated clusters of proteins (for instance,
the regions surrounding VIMSS582581, 582612, 582641, 582657, 582863, 583914 and 583592), including phage elements and Tra-type conjugation
proteins, are not included in this table. Parentheses indicate these duplication events have been tabulated in the general category of signal
transduction or regulatory proteins – individual protein types of particular interest are noted separately by protein name.

aromatica is likely to be highly sensitive to environmental
signals. Nearly half (48%) of the predicted histidine
kinases are contiguous to a putative response regulator on
the chromosomal DNA, indicating they likely constitute
functionally expressed kinase/response regulator pairs.
This is atypically high for contiguous placement on the
chromosome [39].
A relatively high level of diguanylate cyclase (GGDEF
domain [40-42]) signaling capability is implied in D. aromatica by the presence of 57 proteins encoding a GGDEF
domain (Interpro IPR000160 [see Additional file 5]) and
an additional 10 with a GGDEF response regulator
(COG1639) [40]. E. coli, for comparison, encodes 19. This
gene family also appears to have undergone recent expansion in this microbe's evolutionary history. Microbes having a large number of proteins or even a diverse array of
COG T elements do not a priori encode a large number of
GGDEF elements, as Stigmatella aurantiaca, Myxococcus,
Xanthus DK1622 and Burkholderia pseudomallei, by contrast, have very large genomes with extensive COG T pop-

ulations, yet each have 20 or fewer proteins identified as
having GGDEF domains [see Additional file 5], and
Prochloroccus spp. appear to have none. Conversely,
Oceanospirillum has a relatively small genome, yet has 112
proteins identified as likely GGDEF domain/IPR000160
proteins. GGDEF/EAL domain response regulators have
been implicated in root colonization in Pseudomonas putida (Matilla et al. 2007); in E. coli the GGDEF domaincontaining YddV protein upregulates the transcription of
a number of cell wall modification enzymes [42], and in
point of fact, D. aromatica's VIMSS581804, a GGDEF
domain containing homolog of the YddV E. coli protein,
occurs upstream of a cluster of sixteen cell wall division
proteins (encoded by VIMSS581805-581820).

Figure 4 of predicted metabolic cycles, membrane transporters and signaling proteins in D. aromatica
Overview
Overview of predicted metabolic cycles, membrane transporters and signaling proteins in D. aromatica. Various
metabolic cycles, secretory apparatus and signaling cascades predicted in the annotation process are depicted. TM: transmembrane. Gene names are discussed in the relevant sections of this paper. Areas of the cell depicting Nitrogen, Hydrogen, Carbon
and Sulfur cycles are indicated by "N," "H," "C," and "S."

genome. TolC was originally identified in E. coli as the
channel that exports hemolysin [43], and hemolysin-like
proteins are encoded in this genome. Two groups of ABC
transporters occur as a cluster of five transport genes; these
five-component transporters have been implicated in the
uptake of external macromolecules [44].
The presence of putative lytic factors, lipases, proteases,
antimicrobials, invasins, hemolysins, RTXs and colicins
near potential type I transport systems indicate that these
might be effector molecules used by D. aromatica for interactions with host cells (eg. for cell wall remodeling). Iron
acquisition is likely to be supported by a putative FeoAB
protein cluster (VIMSS583997, 583998), as well as several
siderophore-like receptors and a putative FhuE protein
(outer membrane receptor for ferric iron uptake;
VIMSS583312). Other effector-type proteins, likely to be
involved in cell/host interactions (and which in some species have a role in pathogenicity [45]), are present in this
genome. Adhesins, haemagglutinins, and oxidative stress
neutralizers are relatively abundant in D. aromatica. A
number of transporters occur near the six putative soluble
lytic murein transglycosylases, indicating possible cell
wall remodeling capabilities for host colonization in conjunction with the potential effector molecules noted

above. Homologs of these transporters were shown to
support invasin-type functions in other microbes [45].
Interaction with a host is further implicated by:
VIMSS581582, encoding a potential cell wall-associated
hydrolase, VIMSS581622, encoding a predicted ATPase,
and VIMSS3337824/formerly 581623, encoding a putative membrane-bound lytic transglycosylase.
Eleven tandem copies of a 672 nucleotide insert comprise
a region of the chromosome that challenged the correct
assembly of the genome, and finishing this region was the
final step for the sequencing phase of this project (see
Methods). Unexpectedly, analysis of this region revealed a
potential open reading frame encoding a very large protein that has been variously predicted at 4854, 2519 or
2491 amino acids in size during sequential automated
protein prediction analyses (VIMSS3337779/formerly
582095). This putative protein, even in its smallest configuration, contains a hemolysin-type calcium-binding
region, a cadherin-like domain, and several RTX domains,
which have been associated with adhesion and virulence.
Internal repeats of up to 100 residues with multiple copies
have also been found in proteins from Vibrio, Colwellia,
Bradyrhizobium, and Shewanella spp. (termed "VCBS" proteins as defined by TIGRfam1965).

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:351

Other potential effector proteins include: three hemolysin-like proteins adjacent to type I transporters, eight
proteins with a predicted hemolysin-related function,
including VIMSS583067, a hemolysin activation/secretion protein, VIMSS580979, hemolysin A, VIMSS583372,
phospholipase/hemolysin, VIMSS581868, a homolog of
hemolysin III, predicted by TIGRfam1065 to have cytolytic capability, VIMSS582079, a transport/hemolysin,
and VIMSS581408, a general hemolysin. Five predicted
proteins have possible LysM/invasin domains, including:
VIMSS580547, 581221, 581781, 582766, and 583769.
One gene, VIMSS583068, encodes a putative 2079 amino
acid filamentous haemagglutinin, as well as a hasA-like
domain, making it a candidate for hasA-like function
(hasA is a hemophore that captures heme for iron acquisition [46]).
Type II secretion
Besides the constitutive Sec and Tat pathways, D. aromatica has several candidates for dedicated export secretons of
unknown function, with 3–4 putative orthologs of PulDEFG interspersed with a lytic transglycosylase and a
hemolysin (VIMSS582071-582085). The region from
VIMSS581889 to VIMSS581897 includes pulDEFG type
subunits and an exeA ATPase like protein. It is bracketed
by signaling components comprised of a histidine kinase,
adenylate cyclase, and a protein bearing similarity to the
nitrogen response regulator glnG (VIMSS581898), which
has been shown to be involved in NH3 assimilation in
other species [47].

In addition, there is a nine-gene cluster that encodes several proteins related to toluene resistance (VIMSS581899
to 581906).
A pilus-like gene cluster (which can also be classified as
type IV secretion) occurs in VIMSS580547-580553,
encoding a putative lytic transglycosylase, ABC permease,
cation transporter, pilin peptidase, pilin ATPase and PulFtype protein. This assembly resembles other pilin assemblies associated with attachment to a substrate, such as the
pilus structure responsible for chitin/host colonization in
Vibrio cholerae [48].
Another large pilus-like cluster (VIMSS584160-584173)
occurs in close proximity to the mhpCEFDBAR oxygenase
genes (see eg VIMSS584157, mhpR).
Type III secretion
D. aromatica has been shown to be chemotactic under various circumstances. The flagellar proteins (FliAEFGHIJKLMNOPQR, FlaABCDEFGHIJK) are followed by an
additional cluster of 15 chemotaxis/signal transduction
genes (VIMSS580462-580476), and homologs of FlhC
and D regulatory elements required for the expression of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/351

flagellar proteins (VIMSS582640 and 582641) [49], identified by phylogenetic clustering, are also present. Since D.
aromatica has a flagellum and displays chemotactic behavior, it is likely that the flagellar gene cluster is solely related
to locomotion, though type III secretion systems can also
encode dedicated protein translocation machineries that
deliver bacterial pathogenicity proteins directly to the
cytosol of eukaryotic host cells [50].
Type IV secretion
There are two copies of a twenty-one gene cluster that
includes ten putative conjugal transfer (Tra) sex-pilus type
genes in the D. aromatica genome (VIMSS582582-582601
and VIMSS582864-582884), indicating a typeIV secretion
structure that is related to non-pathogenic cell-cell interactions [51].
Type VI secretion
A large cluster of transport proteins that is related to the
virulence associated genetic locus HIS-1 of Pseudomonas
aeruginosa and the VAS genes of V. cholerae [52,53]
includes homologs of hcp1, IcmF and clpV (as
VIMSS583005, 582995 and 583009, respectively, in D.
aromatica [see Additional file 6]). This IcmF-associated
(IAHP) cluster has been associated with mediation of host
interactions, via export of effector proteins that lack signal
sequences [53]. Further evidence for type VI secretion is
found in the presence of three proteins containing a Vgr
secretion motif modeled by TIGRfam3361, which is
found only in genomes having type VI secretory apparatus. Though most bacteria that contain IcmF clusters are
pathogenic agents that associate with eukaryotic cell hosts
[54], it has been reported that the host interactions supported by this cluster are not restricted to pathogens [55].

The type IV pili systems might be involved in biofilm
development, as interactions with biofilm surfaces are
affected by force-generating motility structures, including
type IV pili and flagella [56]. Quorum sensing is a deciding input for biofilm formation, and the presence of an
exopolysaccharide synthetic cluster lends further support
for biofilm formation. Further, derivatives of nitrous
oxide, which is an evident substrate for D. aromatica, are a
key signal for biofilm formation vs cell dispersion in the
microbe P. aeruginosa [57].
Cellular interactions with community – quorum sensing
Quorum sensing uses specific membrane bound receptors
to detect autoinducers released into the environment. It is
involved in both intra- and inter-species density detection
[58,59]. Cell density has been shown to regulate a number
of cellular responses, including bioluminescence, swarming, expression of virulence factors, secretion, and motility
(as reviewed in Withers et al. 2001 [60]).

D. aromatica encodes six histidine kinase receptor proteins
that are similar to the quorum sensing protein QseC of E.
coli (VIMSS580745, 582451, 582897, 583274, 3337577
(formerly 583538), and 583893), five of which co-occur
on the chromosome with homologs of the CheY like QseB
regulator, and two of which appear to be the product of a
recent duplication event (VIMSS583893 & 3337577). Of
the six QseC homologs, phylogenetic analysis indicates
VIMSS582451 is most similar to QseC from E. coli, where
the QseBC complex regulates motility via the FlhCD master flagellar regulators (VIMSS582640 and 582641). The
presence of several qseC/B gene pairs indicates the possibility of specific responses that are dependant on different
sensing strategies. In other species, expression of ABC
exporters is regulated by quorum sensing systems [46];
gene family expansion is indicated in the ABC export gene
pool as well as the qseC/B sensors in D. aromatica.
N-acyl-homoserine lactone is the autoinducer typical for
gram negative bacteria [61], yet D. aromatica lacks any recognizable AHL synthesis genes. Ralstonia Betaproteobacteria likewise encode several proteins in the qseC gene
family and display a diversity of candidate cell density signaling compounds other than AHL [62]. The utility of
having a diverse array of quorum sensing proteins
remains to be determined, but appears likely to be associated with a complex, and possibly symbiotic, lifestyle for
D. aromatica.
Cellular interactions with the environment – stress
Carbon Storage
Poly-hydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) store carbon energy, are
synthesized from the catabolism of lipids, and constitute
up to almost 90% of the dry weight of the Betaproteobacteria species Comamonas testosteroni [63]. These lipid-like
carbon/energy storage polymers are found in granular
inclusions. PhaR candidate VIMSS583509 is likely to be a
regulatory protein for PHA synthesis, and is found near
other proteins associated with PHA granule biosynthesis
and utilization in D. aromatica (VIMSS583511-513).

Phasins are relatively small proteins (180–200 aas) that
have been shown to associate with PHA inclusions [64].
There are six copies of phasin-type proteins, with indications of recent gene duplication for three of the phasintype proteins (VIMSS581881, 582264, and 3337571 (formerly 583582)). There are also three homologs of the
active subunit poly-B-hydroxybutyrate polymerase (PhaC
orthologs) and two Pha reductase candidates present in a
direct repeat, which is also found in Legionella pneumophila.
Interestingly,
one
PhaC-like
protein,
VIMSS583511, is 70% identical to NodG of Azospirillum
brasilense, a nodulation protein [65]. No PhaA-like
ketothiolase ortholog is present. The presence of an
amplified gene pool for carbon storage granules in D. aromatica may confer the ability to survive under low nutrient

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/351

conditions, and poly-3-hydroxybutyrate accumulation
has recently been observed in A. aromaticum EbN1 cultures displaying reduced growth [66].
Phosphate
Inorganic polyphosphate storage appears likely, as both
polyphosphate kinase (Ppk, VIMSS582444) and exopolyphosphatase (Ppx, VIMSS583870) are present. These
genes are similar to those encoded in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in that they are in disparate regions of the chromosome [67]. Polyphosphate has been implicated in stress
response due to low nutrients in the environment [68],
and also in DNA uptake [69].

Phosphate transport appears to be encoded in a large cluster of genes (VIMSS581746-581752), and response to
phosphate starvation is likely supported by the PhoH
homolog VIMSS583854.
Biofilm formation
There is a large cluster of exopolysaccharide export (eps)
associated genes, including a proposed exosortase (epsH,
VIMSS582792). Presence of the eps family proteins
(VIMSS582786, VIMSS582790-582801) indicates capsular exopolysaccharide production, associated with either
host cell interactions (including root colonization [70])
or biofilm production in soil sediments [71]. D. aromatica
is one of a small number of species (19 out of 280
genomes assessed by Haft et al. [71]) that also encodes the
PEP-CTERM export system. The PEP-CTERM signal,
present in sixteen proteins in this genome, is proposed to
be exported via a potential exportase, represented in this
genome by epsH (VIMSS582792). Additionally, the presence of proteins encoding this putative exportase is seen
only in genomes also encoding the eps genes.
Metabolic Cycles
Nitrogen
D. aromatica closely reflects several metabolic pathways of
R. capsulatus, which is present in the rhizosphere, and its
assimilatory nitrate/nitrite reductase cluster is highly similar to the R. capsulatus cluster [72]. Encoded nitrate
response elements also indicate a possible plant association for this microbe, as nitrate can act as a terminal electron acceptor in the oxygen-limited rhizosphere.
Alternatively, nitrous oxide (NO) reduction can indicate
the ability to respond to anti-microbial NO production by
a host (used by the host to mitigate infection [73]). Several gene families are present that indicate interactions
with a eukaryotic host species, including response elements that potentially neutralize host defense molecules,
in particular nitric oxide and other nitrogenous species.

Nitrate is imported into the cytosol by NasDEF in Klebsiella pneumoniae [74] and expression of nitrate and nitrite
reductases is regulated by the nasT protein in Azotobacter
Page 14 of 23

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:351

vinelandii [75]. A homologous set of these genes are
encoded by the cluster VIMSS580377-580380 (NasDEFT), and a homolog of narK is immediately downstream at VIMSS580384, and is likely involved in nitrite
extrusion. Upstream, a putative nasA/nirBDC cluster
(assimilatory nitrate and nitrite reduction) is encoded
near the narXL-like nitrate response element.
VIMSS580393 encodes a nitrate reductase that is homologous to the NasA cytosolic nitrate reductase of Klebsiella
pneumoniae [76]. Community studies have correlated the
presence of NasA-encoding bacteria with the ability to use
nitrate as the sole source of nitrogen [77]. The large and
small subunits of nitrite reductase (VIMSS580391 nirB
and VIMSS580390 nirD) are immediately adjacent to a
transporter with a putative nitrite transport function
(VIMSS580389 NirC-like protein). The NirB orf is also
highly homologous to both NasB (nitrite reductase) and
NasC (NADH reductase which passes electrons to NasA)
of Klebsiella pneumoniae. HMMs created from alignments
seeded by the NasB and NasC genes scored at 3.2e-193 and
4.0e-159, respectively, to the VIMSS580391 NirB protein.
D. aromatica is similar to Methylococcus capsulatus, Ralstonia solanacearum, Polaromonas, and Rhodoferax ferrireducens
for nasA, nirB and nirD gene clusters. However, the presence of the putative transporter nirC (VIMSS580389)
shares unique similarity to the E. coli and Salmonella nirBCD clusters.
Putative periplasmic, dissimilatory nitrate reduction,
which is a candidate for denitrification capability [78], is
encoded by the napDABC genes (VIMSS 3337807/
581796-581799). A probable cytochrome c', implicated
in nitric oxide binding as protection against potentially
toxic excess NO generated during nitrite reduction [79], is
encoded by VIMSS582015. Although most denitrifiers are
free living, plant-associated denitrifiers do exist [80].
There is no dissimilatory nitrate reductive complex
narGHIJ, but rather, NarG and NarH-like proteins are
found in the evolutionarily-related perchlorate reductase
alpha and beta subunits [24]. These proteins are present
in the pcrABCDcld cluster, VIMSS582649-582652 and
VIMSS584327, as previously reported for Dechloromonas
species [81].
Ammonia incorporation appears to be metabolically feasible via a putative glu-ammonia ligase (VIMSS581081),
an enzyme that incorporates free ammonia into the cell
via ligation to a glutamic acid. An ammonium transporter
and cognate regulator are likely encoded in the Amt and
GlnK-like proteins VIMSS581101 and 581102.
Urea catabolism as a further source of nitrogen is suggested by two different urea degradation enzyme clusters.
The first co-occurs with a urea ABC-transport system, just
upstream of a putative nickel-dependent urea amidohy-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/351

drolase (urease) enzyme cluster (VIMSS583666, 583671–
583674, and VIMSS583677-583683; see Table 4). The
second pathway is suggested by a cluster of urea carboxylase/allophanate hydrolase enzymes (VIMSS581083581085, described by TIGRfams 1891, 2712, 2713, 3424
and 3425), which comprise four proteins involved in urea
degradation to ammonia and carbon dioxide in other species, as well as an amidohydrolase [82].
Nitric oxide (NO) reductase
The chromosomal region around D. aromatica's two nosZ
homologs is notably different from near-neighbors A. aromaticum EbN1 and Ralstonia solanacearum which encode a
nosRZDFYL cluster. D. aromatica's nosRZDFYL operon
lacks the nosRFYL genes, and displays other notable differences with most nitrate reducing microbes. In D. aromatica, two identical nosZ reductase-like genes (annotated
as nosZ1 and nosZ2, VIMSS583543 and VIMSS583547)
are adjacent to two cytochrome c553s, a ferredoxin, and a
transport accessory protein, and are uniquely embedded
within a histidine kinase/response regulator cluster and
include nosD and a napGH-like pair that potentially couples quinone oxidation to cytochrome c reduction. This
indicates the NO response might be involved in cell signaling and as a possible general detoxification mechanism
for nitric oxide.

The Epsilonproteobacteria Wolinella succinogenes is quite
similar to D. aromatica for nitric oxide reductase genes
(both have two nosZ genes, a nosD gene and a napGH pair
in the same order and orientation [83]), but the W. succinogenes genome lacks the embedded signaling protein
cluster. Further, nitric oxide reductase homologs NorDQEBC (VIMSS582097, 582100–582103), along with
the cytochrome c' protein (VIMSS582015), which has
been shown to bind nitric oxide (NO) prior to its reduction [79], are all present, and potentially act in detoxification roles. It has been shown that formation of anaerobic
biofilms of P. aeruginosa (which cause chronic lung infections in cystic fibrosis) require NO reductase when quorum has been reached [84], so a role in signaling and
complex cell behavior is possible.
W. succinogenes shares other genome features with D. aromatica. It encodes only 2042 orfs, yet has a large number
of signaling proteins, histidine kinases, and GGDEF proteins relative to its genome size. It also encodes nif genes,
several genes similar to virulence factors, and similarity in
the nitrous oxide enzyme cluster noted above. W. succinogenes is evolutionarily related to two pathogenic species
(Helicobacter pylori and Campylobacter jejuni), and displays
eukaryotic host interactions, yet is not known to be pathogenic [85]. The distinction between effector molecules
causing a pathogenic interaction and a symbiotic one is
unclear.

The annotated nitrogen fixation homologs (Nif proteins) are embedded with a cluster of urea transport and degradation genes (Ure, Urea
amidohydrolase and Urt transport families).

Nitrogen Fixation
Nitrogen fixation capability in D. aromatica is indicated by
a complex of nif-like genes (see Table 4), that include
putative nitrogenase alpha (NifD, VIMSS583693) and
beta (NifK, VIMSS583694) subunits of the molybdenumiron protein, an ATP-binding iron-sulfur protein (NifH,
VIMSS583692), and the regulatory protein NifL
(VIMSS583623), that share significant sequence similarity
and synteny to the free-living soil microbe Azotobacter
vinelandii. D. aromatica further encodes a complex that is
likely to transport electrons to the nitrogenase, by using a
six subunit rnfABCDGE-like cluster (VIMSS583616-

583619, 583621 and 583622) that is phylogenomically
related to the Rhodobacter capsulatus complex used for
nitrogen fixation [86]. There is a second rnf-like NADH
oxidoreductase complex composed of VIMSS583911583916, of unknown involvement (see Fig. 4). A. aromaticum EbN1 and Azoarcus BH72 each encode two rnf-like
clusters as well.
Embedded in the putative nitrogen fixation cluster are two
gene families involved in urea metabolism (Table 4). This
includes the urea transport proteins (UrtABCDE) and urea
hydrolase enzyme family (Ure protein family).

Hydrogenases associated with nitrogen fixation
Uptake hydrogenase is involved in the nitrogen fixation
cycle in root nodule symbionts where it is thought to
increase efficiency via oxidation of the co-produced
hydrogen (H2) [87]. D. aromatica encodes a cluster of 13
predicted orfs (Hydrogenase-1 cluster, VIMSS581358581370; Table 5) that includes a hydrogenase cluster syntenic to the hoxKGZMLOQR(T)V genes found in Azotobacter vinelandii, which reversibly oxidize H2 in that
organism [88]. This cluster is followed by a second hydrogenase (Hydrogenase-2 cluster, VIMSS581373-581383).
The hydrogenase assembly proteins, hypABF and CDE are
included (VIMSS581368-581370 and 581380-581381,
and VIMSS3337851 (formerly 581382)) as well as proteins related to the hydrogen uptake (hup) genes of various rhizobial microbes [87]. The second region, with the
hyp and hyd-like clusters, lacks overall synteny to any one
genome currently sequenced. It does, however, display
regions of genes that share synteny with Rhodoferax ferrireducens, which displays the highest percent identity across
the cluster, both in terms of synteny and protein identity.

VIMSS581384 encodes a homolog of the HoxA hydrogenase transcriptional regulator, which has been shown to
be expressed only during symbiosis in some species [89].
Regulation is indicated by homologs of NtrX
(VIMSS581123) and NtrY (VIMSS581124); the NtrXY
pathway comprises a two-component signaling system
involved in the regulation of nitrogen fixation in Azorhizobium caulinodans ORS571 [90].
Carbon Fixation via the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle
The genes indicative of carbon fixation, using the Calvin
cycle, are present in the D. aromatica genome. This
includes
Ribulose
1,5-bisphosphate
carboxylase
(RuBisCo, VIMSS581681), phosphoribulokinase (cbbP/
PrkB, VIMSS581690), and a fructose bisphosphate (fba,
VIMSS581693) of the Calvin cycle subtype. The RuBisCo
cbbM gene is of the fairly rare type II form. D. aromatica
CbbM displays a surprisingly high 77% amino acid identity to CbbM found in the deep-sea tube worm Riftia pachyptila symbiont [91]. In a recent study of aquatic
sediments, Rhodoferax fermentans, Rhodospirillum fulvum

A large region of putative hydrogenases associated with nitrogen fixation is noted. Hydrogenase-1 is composed of hox/hup genes, hydrogenase-2 of
the hyb genes, and the nickel insertion/maturation complex, hyp (present in two clusters: hypABF and hypCDE).

and R. rubrum were also found to possess the cbbM type II
isoform of RuBisCo [92]; this sub-type is shared by a only
a few microbial species.
Further putative Cbb proteins are encoded by
VIMSS581680 & 581688, candidates for CbbR (regulator
for the cbb operon) and CbbY (found downstream of
RuBisCo in R. sphaeroides [93]), respectively.
The presence of the cbbM gene suggests the ability to carry
out the energetically costly fixation of CO2, though such
functionality has yet to be observed, and carbon dioxide
fixation capability has been found in only a few members
of the microbial community.
There is a potential glycolate salvage pathway indicated by
the presence of two isoforms of phosphoglycolate phosphatase (gph, VIMSS583850 and 581830). In other organisms, phosphoglycolate results from the oxidase activity
of RuBisCo in the Calvin cycle, when concentrations of
carbon dioxide are low relative to oxygen. In Ralstonia
(Alcaligenes) eutropha and Rhodobacter sphaeroides, the gph
gene (cbbZ) is located on an operon along with other
Calvin cycle enzymes, including RuBisCo. In D. aromatica,
the gph candidates for this gene (VIMSS583850 and
581830), are removed from the other cbb genes on the
chromosome in D. aromatica; however VIMSS581830 is
adjacent to a homolog of Ribulose-phosphate 3-epimerase (VIMSS581829, rpe).
The ccoSNOQP gene cluster codes for a cbb-type cytochrome oxidase that functions as the terminal electron
donor to O2 in the aerobic respiration of Rhodobacter capsulatus [94]. These genes are present in a cluster as
VIMSS580484-580486 and VIMSS584273-584274; note
that these genes are present in a large number of Betaproteobacteria.
Other carbon cycles, such at the reverse TCA cycle and the
Wood-Ljungdahl pathways, are missing critical enzymes
in this genome, and are not present as such.
Sulfur
Sulfate and thiosulfate transport appear to be encoded in
the gene cluster composed of an OmpA type protein
(VIMSS581631) followed by orthologs of a sulfate/thiosulfate specific binding protein Sbp (VIMSS581632), a
CysU or T sulfate/thiosulfate transport system permease T
protein (VIMSS581633), a CysW ABC-type sulfate transport system permease component (VIMSS581634), and a
CysA ATP-binding component of sulfate permease
(VIMSS581635).

In addition, candidates for the transcriptional regulator of
sulfur assimilation from sulfate are present and include:

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/351

CysB, CysH, and CysI (VIMSS582364, 582360 and
582362, respectively).
A probable sulfur oxidation enzyme cluster is present and
contains homologs of SoxFRCDYZAXB [95], with a putative SoxCD sulfur dehydrogenase, SoxF sulfide dehydrogenase, and SoxB sulfate thiohydrolase, which is predicted
to support thiosulfate oxidation to sulphate (see Fig. 5).
Functional predictions are taken from Friedrich et al. [95]
[see Additional file 7]. A syntenic sox gene cluster is also
found in Anaeromyxobacter dehalogens (although it lacks
soxFR) and Ralstonia eutropha, but not in A. aromaticum
EbN1. Thiosulfate oxidation, however, has not been
reported under laboratory conditions tested thus far, and
experimental support for this physiological capability
awaits further investigation.
Conversely, the cytoplasmic SorAB complex [96] is not
present in D. aromatica nor A. aromaticum EbN1, although
it is found in several other Betaproteobacteria, including
R. metallidurans, R. eutropha, R. solanacearum, C. violaceum,
and B. japonicum.
Gene Family Expansion
To determine candidates for recent gene duplication
events, extensive phylogenomic profile analyses were conducted for all sets of paralogs in the genome. Flower
Power recruitment and clustering against the non-redundant Genbank protein set was done, and the resulting
alignments were analyzed using the tree-building SCIPHY or Belvu based neighbor-joining utilities. The alignment of two or more D. aromatica protein sequences in a
clade such that they displayed higher % identity to each
other than to orthologs present in other species was interpreted as an indication of a probable recent duplication
event, either in the D. aromatica genome itself or in a progenitor species. Results of this analysis are shown in
Table 3.

Potential gene family expansion is indicated in several
functional groups, including the following: signaling proteins (including cAMP signaling, histidine kinases, and
others), Mhp-like aromatic oxidation complexes, nitrogen
metabolism proteins and transport proteins.
Most duplications indicate that a single gene, rather than
sets of genes, were replicated. An exception is the Tra/Type
IV transport cluster (VIMSS582581-582601 and
VIMSS582864-582884) noted previously. In the protein
sets for the histidine kinase/response regulator, duplication of histidine kinase appears to occur without duplication of the adjacent response regulator. The paralogs
created by recent duplication events are typically found
well-removed from one another on the chromosome,
although some tandem repeats of single genes were noted.

Sulfur oxidation (thiosulfate to sulfate) candidates in R. eutropha, R. palustris, and D. aromatica
Figure 5
Sulfur oxidation (thiosulfate to sulfate) candidates in R. eutropha, R. palustris, and D. aromatica. Proposed model
for this periplasmic complex is as follows: SoxXA, oxidatively links thiosulfate to SoxY; SoxB, potential sulfate thiohydrolase,
interacts with SoxYZ (hydrolyzes sulfate from SoxY to regenerate); SoxCD, a sulfur dehydrogenase; oxidizes persulfide on
SoxY to cysteine-S-sulfate and potentially yields 6 electrons per sulphate; SoxC, sulfite oxidase/dehydrogenase with homology
to nitrate reductase, induced by thiosulfate; SoxDE, both c-type cytochromes with two heme-type binding sites; and SoxF, a
FAD flavoprotein with sulfide dehydrogenase activity. Cyt, cytochrome.

However, the highest percent identity was not found
between pairs of genes in tandem repeats.

Conclusion

dicted enzyme families for anaerobic aromatic
catabolism, though it supports degradation of several aromatic species in the absence of oxygen. The enzymes
responsible for this metabolic function remain to be identified and characterized. It also encodes proteins suggestive of the ability to fix nitrogen and CO2, as well as
thiosulfate oxidation. Converse to aromatic degradation,
these enzymatic functionalities have yet to be experimentally demonstrated. In short, this genome was full of surprises.

Dechloromonas aromatica strain RCB appears to support a
highly complex lifestyle which might involve biofilm formation and interaction with a eukaryotic host. It lacks pre-

The utility of TIGRfams and COGs families in these analyses cannot be overstated. New releases of TIGRfams dur-

ing the course of this analysis provided new insights and
identified new functionality (malonate degradation cluster, PEP-Cterm transport and the epsH putative translocon, and urea degradation all were identified in the
TIGRfam 7.0 additions). The HMM model building and
assessment utilized as the major annotation approach for
this study was employed to cover those protein families of
interest that are not currently covered by TIGRfams. We
utilized K. Sjölander's modelling and analysis tools,
which are highly similar to those used to produce
TIGRfams models. Overall, the extensive use of HMMs
during this analysis allowed high confidence in predicted
protein function, as well as certainty that several families
of previously characterized anaerobic degradation
enzymes for aromatic compounds are not present (eg BssABCD and BcrAB).
