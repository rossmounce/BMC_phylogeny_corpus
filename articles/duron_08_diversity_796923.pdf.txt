Abstract
Background: Inherited bacteria have come to be recognised as important components of
arthropod biology. In addition to mutualistic symbioses, a range of other inherited bacteria are
known to act either as reproductive parasites or as secondary symbionts. Whilst the incidence of
the α-proteobacterium Wolbachia is relatively well established, the current knowledge of other
inherited bacteria is much weaker. Here, we tested 136 arthropod species for a range of inherited
bacteria known to demonstrate reproductive parasitism, sampling each species more intensively
than in past surveys.
Results: The inclusion of inherited bacteria other than Wolbachia increased the number of
infections recorded in our sample from 33 to 57, and the proportion of species infected from 22.8%
to 32.4%. Thus, whilst Wolbachia remained the dominant inherited bacterium, it alone was
responsible for around half of all inherited infections of the bacteria sampled, with members of the
Cardinium, Arsenophonus and Spiroplasma ixodetis clades each occurring in 4% to 7% of all species.
The observation that infection was sometimes rare within host populations, and that there was
variation in presence of symbionts between populations indicates that our survey will itself
underscore incidence.
Conclusion: This extensive survey demonstrates that at least a third of arthropod species are
infected by a diverse assemblage of maternally inherited bacteria that are likely to strongly influence
their hosts' biology, and indicates an urgent need to establish the nature of the interaction between
non-Wolbachia bacteria and their hosts.

Background
The last 20 years have witnessed an explosion of interest
in reproductive parasites: maternally inherited microbial
infections of arthropods that manipulate the reproduc-

tion of their host species towards the production or survival of infected female hosts. This interest has come
largely from the study of one bacterium, Wolbachia. This
bacterium was found to be associated with a variety of difPage 1 of 12

ferent manipulations: forcing asexuality on its host, feminising hosts, inducing incompatibility between infected
males and uninfected (or differently infected) females,
killing males and, most recently, being required for oogenesis [1-4]. Each of these manipulations has been fascinating in its own right, and is also of ecological and
evolutionary importance to the particular host species
that is infected, potentially inducing reproductive isolation, driving changes in sexuality, or alteration in reproductive ecology [5-7]. They also engender strong selection
against their action, driving some of the fastest natural
selection observed in the field [8]. Wolbachia was also
found to be common [9,10]. Thus, the effects described
above in particular species were likely to be widely important.
Until recently, work in the field of reproductive parasitism
has been biased towards Wolbachia, and the potential
importance of inherited parasites has generally been
equated with the importance of Wolbachia. Within the last
five years, a second inherited bacterium, Cardinium, has
received increasing attention. Found in fewer species than
Wolbachia [11,12], its list of manipulation phenotypes is
almost as impressive [13-20]. However, Wolbachia and
Cardinium are just two of many bacterial lineages known

to act as reproductive parasites. To date, five other bacterial reproductive parasites, unrelated to Wolbachia and
Cardinium, have been recorded in the genera Arsenophonus, Rickettsia, non-Cardinium members of the Flavobacterium clade and Spiroplasma (listed in Table 1).
Manipulation of host reproduction has been demonstrated in at least one member of each of these clades,
although in other cases the nature of the interaction with
the host is currently uncertain and reproductive parasitism is unlikely [21-23].
The incidence of Wolbachia [9,10], and more recently Cardinium [11,12], have received much attention in studies of
arthropod biology. However, the incidence of the broader
spectrum of inherited bacteria associated with reproductive parasitism is not known, apart from focussed studies
of spiders [22,24] and Drosophila [25]. In addition, a generally low sampling intensity per species for which screens
have taken place in previous surveys may have resulted in
the underscoring of Wolbachia and Cardinium infections,
as some reproductive parasite infections are rare within a
host species [22,26,27]. The global diversity of reproductive parasites in their natural contexts and the nature of
the interactions with their hosts thus remain to be characterised in depth. Here we test a range of arthropods for the

presence of the seven known reproductive parasite clades
within the eubacteria, estimating incidence, prevalence
and geographical variation between natural populations
of arthropods. We sample each species more intensively
than in past surveys; that is, primarily more than 10 individuals per species. Lastly, we estimate the relatedness of
bacterial strains from our collection to strains recorded
previously. We conclude that two other inherited bacteria,
members of the clade Arsenophonus and members of the
Spiroplasma ixodetis clade, are important associates of
insects and demand further study.

Methods
Arthropod collection
Specimens belonging to major families of terrestrial
arthropods were collected from various field sites, principally in Western Europe (2004–2006). Species were identified based on the morphology of specimens, and the sex
was identified wherever possible through genital morphology. The species screened and their origins are presented in Additional file 1. Most of the spider collection
came from a previous study [22]. One population per species was generally analysed, except for seven species for
which two to three distinct populations were collected.
Within each population there were 1 to 25 individuals
separately investigated for analysis. Arthropods were fixed
in 95% ethanol and stored at 4°C until analysed. Specimens were separated during storage so as to avoid any
potential inter-individual transmission.
Screening and sequencing
Arthropod DNA was extracted using the PROMEGA Wizard® SV 96 Genomic DNA Purification System following
the instructions of the manufacturer. DNA extraction was
performed on the entire body or abdominal tissue rather
than legs, to reduce the risk of missing infection with
reproductive parasites when they are present (false negatives). The DNA quality was systematically tested using
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of a conserved region of the arthropod 18S rDNA using primers
listed in Table 2. Infections have been investigated in each
individual host for seven reproductive parasites: spotted
fever group Rickettsia, Wolbachia, Arsenophonus, Cardinium,
male killers (MKs) within the flavobacteria, S. ixodetis and
S. poulsonii. Independent assays for infection by each
reproductive parasite were performed using PCR amplification of a fragment of either the 16S rDNA gene or the
17-kDa ompA gene using specific primers (Table 2).
Infected-positive individuals were used as positive controls in each PCR assay (Table 2). Additional PCR amplifications of the Wolbachia surface protein gene (wsp) were
completed in some cases to differentiate the diversity of
strains present (primers listed in Table 2). PCRs were performed under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 95°C for 2 minutes, 35 cycles of denaturation

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/27

(94°C, 30 seconds), annealing (50 to 55°C, depending
on primers, 30 seconds), extension (72°C, 1 minute to 1
minute 30 seconds) and a final extension at 72°C for 5
minutes. The PCR products were electrophoresed in a
1.5% agarose gel. Where a PCR product was obtained, this
was sequenced from two randomly sampled individuals
per infected species to ensure that the record represented
a true positive and not a PCR artefact or related bacterium.
PCR products were sequenced directly (through both
strands) and analysed using the Basic Local Alignment
Search Tool (BLAST) to establish that they were within the
target clade. The relationship between strains was then
estimated. Sequences were first aligned and modified visually using MEGA version 3.1 [28]. Phylogenetic analyses
were conducted by the neighbour-joining (NJ) method
and the maximum-parsimony (MP) method using MEGA
version 3.1 [28]. NJ phylogenies were constructed based
upon unambiguously aligned sites using the Tajima-Nei
model of nucleotide substitution [29]. MP phylogenies
were constructed using the close-neighbour-interchange
method [30]. Bootstrap probabilities were calculated by
generating 1000 bootstrap replicates. The sequences are
deposited in GenBank (accession numbers EU333926–
EU333941 and EU727094–EU727140).

Results
Distribution of infection
We assayed for the presence of 7 putative reproductive
parasites in 2052 individual arthropods from 136 species
encompassing 115 genera, 36 families, 15 orders and
three classes. All host DNA samples retained for analysis
were positive for PCR amplification using the 18S rDNA
arthropod universal primers, indicating satisfactory DNA
template quality (less than 1% of DNA templates failed to
amplify the 18S rDNA fragment by PCR). Of the 136 species examined, PCR assay indicated the occurrence of
infections by putative bacterial reproductive parasites in
44 species (32.4%). Wolbachia was found to infect 31 species (22.8%), S. ixodetis infected 9 species (6.6%), Arsenophonus infected 6 species (4.4%), Cardinium infected 6
species (4.4%), spotted fever group Rickettsia infected 1
species (0.7%) and S. poulsonii infected 1 species (0.7%);
see Table 3 and Additional file 2.

For Wolbachia, 29 single infections were observed (as
ascertained through direct sequences of PCR products that
were easily readable without messy peaks) and two multiple infections (with messy peaks). That these were double
infections was ascertained through the observation of a
clean sequence using primer pairs that distinguish clades
within Wolbachia, making a total of 33 strains detected.
Arsenophonus was also observed as a double infection in
one species, Polistes nimpha, where direct sequence indicated more than one infection; strains were differentiated
using the ArsF3/ArsR3 and ArsF2/ArsR2 pairs of 16S rDNA

primers. Thus, seven Arsenophonus infections were
observed in total. Cardinium, Rickettsia, S. ixodetis and S.
poulsonii where present were observed solely as single
infections. Thus, in total we obtained 57 different strains
allied to inherited parasites in our sample, 33 Wolbachia
and 24 'non-Wolbachia'. Co-infection by strains of unrelated bacteria (such as Wolbachia and Cardinium) was
observed in 8 of the 44 infected species (Table 3 and Additional file 2). Adding in the three species co-infected with
different strains of the same bacterium, 10 species were
finally infected by a diverse assemblage of bacterial
strains. However, in only nine species did this reflect coinfection at the individual level.
Note that the assays for flavobacteria, Arsenophonus and
Spiroplasma poulsonii also resulted in false positives for
these bacteria (a band was present, but the sequence was

outside of the target clade). In the case of the flavobacterium, a member of the beneficial clade of inherited bacteria, Blattabacterium, was detected in Loboptera decipiens, a
cockroach, and a known obligate symbiont in Icerya purchasi, a scale insect. In the case of Arsenophonus, Sodalis sp.
was detected in one of the 136 species (0.7%), Providencia
sp. in two (1.5%), Pectobacterium sp. in two (1.5%), Pantoea sp. in one (0.7%) and Serratia sp. in one (0.7%). Of
these, Sodalis is known to be an inherited bacterium, and
the others are likely to represent gut or environmental
contaminants. In the case of the S. poulsonii assay, two
spiroplasmas from outside the citri clade were amplified,
whose relationship with the host species is uncertain.
These infections were all excluded from further analysis.
We asked four questions of the true positive infections.
First, do inherited parasites differ in incidence? Second,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/27

are there any host taxa where infection is more or less
common than expected? Third, what is the prevalence of
infection in different species, and is there any evidence of
sex bias in infection prevalence that would indicate sexratio distortion activity? Fourth, does narrow geographic
sampling cause an underestimation of incidence?

common in the spider sample than in those of other
arthropods. Notably, results from assays of individuals via
templates derived from abdomen were reflected precisely
by results from the template derived from legs, indicating
that the infections that were detected were internalised
within the host, and not derived from the contents of the
gut. Despite representing less than 20% of the total species sample, all six Cardinium infections were found in this
group (Fisher's exact test, P < 0.001). Five of the nine S.
ixodetis infected species and 10 of 30 Wolbachia infected
species were also in the Araneae, both of which are cases
of over-representation (Fisher's exact test incidence in Araneae versus others; P < 0.025 in each case). Of the four
infections represented more than once in the data set,
only Arsenophonus was not over-represented in spiders (1
of 26 Araneae species versus 5 of 110 non-Araneae;
Fisher's exact test, P > 0.5).

With respect to the first question, Wolbachia was found to
infect significantly more species than the other maternally
inherited bacteria (P < 0.001, Fisher's exact test). Wolbachia was found in most families of three classes of terrestrial arthropods (Arachnida, Insecta and Malacostraca;
Table 3 and Additional file 1). The point estimate of
22.8% of species infected with Wolbachia in this study is
numerically higher than recorded previously, but still lies
close to the range of values previously reported in wide
surveys of arthropods (incidence from 16.6% [9] to
19.3% [10]; all P > 0.18, Fisher's exact test).

The third question we asked related to the prevalence of
these bacteria and the effect of screening depth on the
incidence discovered. Inherited bacteria exist at a variety
of prevalence levels in natural populations, from 1% to
100% of individuals. Where Wolbachia infection was
observed in a host species, prevalence ranged from rare
(5%) to very common (100%) at the population level
(Table 4 and Additional file 1). Wolbachia infection was
generally fixed, or close to fixation, except in spiders
where prevalence was more variable (5% to 95%). In Cardinium, S. ixodetis and S. poulsonii-infected species, low
and medium prevalence (15% to 75%) was observed in
all cases, and infection was never observed in all specimens. In the Rickettsia-infected species, only 1 individual
(8.3%) out of 12 was positive for infection. In the case of
Arsenophonus, prevalence reached systematically high val-

The second question we examined was: are there any host
taxa where infection with reproductive parasites is more
common? Four orders were sampled with more than 20
species: Araneae, Coleoptera, Diptera and Hemiptera.
Infection incidence varied between these taxa (Fisher's
exact test, P = 0.002). As suggested previously, the Araneae
were a particular hotspot (with 16 species infected out of
26; 61.5%) having higher incidence than Coleoptera (P =
0.001) and Diptera (P = 0.004) but not Hemiptera (P =
0.15). However, the three insect clades remain homogeneous (P = 0.19), although the Hemiptera (8 out of 21
species infected; 38.1%) has a higher incidence than Coleoptera (4 out of 26; 15%) and Diptera (5 out of 25; 20%).
The Araneae (spiders) was a particular hotspot for Cardinium, with Wolbachia and S. ixodetis infections also more

ues (>75%) and infection was frequently fixed, except in
the case of Arsenophonus infection in the fly Protocalliphora
sp. (2 infected individuals out of 12; 16.7%). Aside from
the Protocalliphora datum, Arsenophonus prevalence data
contrasted with the original record of Arsenophonus nasoniae, which infected just 4% of individuals in the wasp
Nasonia vitripennis [31].
We also examined the data for sex bias in infection prevalence, as an indication of potential sex ratio distorting
activity. Bacteria other than Wolbachia showed no evidence of sex-biased prevalence (all P > 0.08, Fisher's exact
test; see Additional file 1). Wolbachia did show evidence
for sex-biased prevalence in some cases. Three species,
Meta mengei (Tetragnathidae), Tetragnatha montana
(Tetragnathidae) and Armadillidium vulgare (Armadillidiidae) carried Wolbachia infection more commonly in
females than males (P = 0.001, 0.03 and 0.0001, respectively, Fisher's exact test) but only M. mengei and A. vulgare
displayed a significant difference after sequential Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (feminising
Wolbachia was previously evidenced in A. vulgare; compare with [32]). Whilst there was no evidence to reject the
null hypothesis of equal prevalence in male and females
in other cases, we would note that in all spider species
(apart from Pholcus phalangioides) and in the moth Chilo
sp. (Crambidae), Wolbachia infection was generally rarer
in males than females, or was even absent in males, suggesting more intensive sampling would be useful. Furthermore, males do not exist in the parthenogenetic wasp
Diplolepis rosae (Cynipidae) and all of the females sampled
were Wolbachia-positive.
The fourth question related to the presence of geographic
variation in incidence that may potentially produce
underscoring of incidence where one population alone is
sampled. We examined specimens from different locations in seven species (see Additional file 1). Four of the
species showed no variation in infection presence
between locations: the different populations of Argiope
lobata (Araneidae) and Cetonia aurata (Scarabaeidae) were
uninfected in all locations and P. phalangioides and A. vulgare were infected with the same strain (based on 16S
rDNA sequences) wherever sampled. In contrast, in
Linyphia triangularis (Linyphiidae), Cylisticus convexus

(Cylisticidae) and Porcellio dilatatus (Porcellionidae), the
infection presence varied between the populations sampled. In C. convexus and P. dilatatus, there was one Wolbachia-infected and one uninfected population, which in
the case of P. dilatatus related to sub-specific status (P. d.
petiti was infected whereas P. d. dilatatus was not; see Additional file 1). In the case of L. triangularis, the two United
Kingdom populations were infected by Wolbachia, but the
population from Germany was not (P = 0.004, Fisher's
exact test; see Additional file 1). Cardinium infection was
observed to be common in both the United Kingdom and
German L. triangularis populations, and the prevalence
did not differ significantly between populations (P = 0.27,
Fisher's exact test).
Phylogenetic analysis
The phylogenetic relationships amongst each group of
inherited bacterium was estimated using the sequences
obtained in this study (including those of non-inherited
bacteria), as well as sequences from other hosts available
in GenBank. Topologies of the trees obtained under MP
were similar to the NJ trees presented in Additional files 3
to 7. Each bacterial group formed a distinct and robust
monophyletic clade of arthropod symbionts. Within each
group, very closely related symbionts were frequently
found in distantly related arthropod hosts.

Arthropods from this study carried Wolbachia strains
belonging to four supergroups (A, B, F and G) of the eight
currently recognised within the Wolbachia clade (A to H;
see [33]). Although the Wolbachia phylogeny was primarily constructed based on the 16S rDNA sequences from
mono-infected species (Additional file 3A), the phylogeny
of the Wolbachia strains occurring in multi-infection
(such as in Aedes albopictus and Protocalliphora sp.)
have been established using the wsp sequences (Additional file 3B). Most Wolbachia strains (20 out of 33
strains; 60.6%) belonged to the B supergroup. Six Wolbachia strains (18.2%) belonged to the A supergroup, five
(15.2%) to the G supergroup and one (3.0%) to the F
supergroup. However, the L. triangularis Wolbachia could
not be attached to any supergroup currently described,
although it clustered with the Wolbachia strain from Drosophila takahashii described previously [25] (Additional
file 3A).

The Cardinium phylogeny was constructed using the six
Cardinium 16S rDNA sequences from spiders, as well as
Cardinium sequences from Hymenoptera, the Hemiptera
and the Acari available in GenBank, using the closest
known relative of Cardinium, the Acanthamoeba symbiont
Amoebophilus asiaticus, as an outgroup (Additional file 4).
The spider Cardinium strains clearly fall within the Cardinium species group and especially with Cardinium strains
from Acari species. However, the power of the phylogeny
to resolve relationships between the strains collected to
date is poor, owing to a dearth of informative characters
in the slow evolving 16S rDNA sequence.
Nine Spiroplasma strains from diverse origins (Araneae,
Diptera and Hemiptera) clustered strongly in the S. ixodetis clade, but bootstrapping provided little support to
branches within this clade (Additional file 5). The
Spiroplasma strain of Pardosa lugubris (Lycosidae) clustered
closely with S. poulsonii within the S. citri clade. The
attachment of the two remaining Spiroplasma strains to a
Spiroplasma clade remained ambiguous, although they are
close to the S. citri clade.
The Rickettsia strain from Mordellistena sp. clearly falls
among the rickettsias and has highest sequence similarity
to the maternally inherited endosymbiont of the cat fleas
Ctenocephalides felis which belong to the Rickettsia felis
group [34] (Additional file 6). However, the strain of Mordellistena. sp. was highly divergent from the MK Rickettsia
identified in Coccinellidae.
The Arsenophonus strains formed a robust clade of arthropod endosymbionts (Additional file 7). The bacterial
strains of Hippobosca equina (Hippoboscidae), Protocalliphora sp. (Calliphoridae), Pyrrhocoris apterus (Pyrrhocoridae) and Polistes nimpha (Vespidae) were tightly clustered
with the MK Arsenophonus strain. The three other Arsenophonus strains from Araneus diadematus (Araneae), Loboptera decipiens (Blatellidae) and P. nimpha fitted better with
bacterial strains isolated in bloodsucking flies [35] and
lice [36]. Although some phylogenetic structure did exist
within the Arsenophonus clade, it is not well resolved by
analysis of the 16S rRNA gene, although the subgroup
which included the MK Arsenophonus appears distinct
from Arsenophonus isolates from bloodsucking flies and
lice previously reported [35,36].

Discussion
We sampled a medium number of male and female individuals (median 20 total) of 136 arthropods species for
Wolbachia, a reproductive parasite well known to be common in various arthropod taxa [9,10], for Cardinium, a
reproductive parasite known to exist widely but in fewer
species [11,12,22], and for five other unrelated reproductive parasites whose incidence and prevalence were largely

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/27

unknown. The observed incidence of infection for arthropods was 32.4% for inherited bacteria putatively acting as
reproductive parasites.
Our results reveal that Wolbachia is, as expected, the most
common reproductive parasite clade associated with
arthropods, being recorded in 22.8% of species in our
sample. Three other clades, Cardinium, S. ixodetis and Arsenophonus bacteria were present widely, with each occurring in 4% to 7% of the arthropod species. Whilst there
has been some work on the former of these bacteria, S. ixodetis and Arsenophonus clearly represent 'understudied
groups' that merit careful investigation. We would also
note that the frequency of these four bacteria means that
around one fifth of infections co-occurred with other species of inherited bacteria (8 of 44 infected species carry
two different bacteria), an estimate of course made conservative by our own restrictive sampling for 'known' symbiont groups. This observation reinforces the call of
Weeks et al. [37] to adequately sample the inherited flora
of a species before interpreting data in terms of particular
inherited bacteria.
There were three clades of bacteria that were either found
in just one species or not found: Rickettsia, S. poulsonii and
flavobacteria relatives. With respect to flavobacteria, the
PCR assay detected allied clades of beneficial bacteria and
was thus broad spectrum. We can thus be clear that this
bacterial clade does not commonly reach mid or high
prevalence outside ladybird beetles, where infection was
initially established [38]. It is possible that this bacterial
group is phylogenetically restricted to being 'ladybird
MK'. The low incidence of Rickettsia was more surprising.
These have been conjectured as being common, understudied bacterial symbionts of arthropods [39], but we
can be confident that spotted fever group Rickettsia does
not commonly exist at medium to high prevalence. This
comment is made with the caveat that our screen for Rickettsia was relatively narrow, designed to find bacteria
allied to a clade of ladybird MK, and would exclude some
Rickettsia. Finally, there is S. poulsonii, otherwise known as
group I spiroplasmas [40]. Other spiroplasmas were
detected in the assay, indicating the PCR assay had a relatively broad catch. S. poulsonii itself is a MK associate of
Drosophila species [41], with related strains in leafhoppers.
Clearly, whilst spiroplasmas may be common, this particular clade either has low incidence, or always has low
prevalence (as is the case for S. poulsonii in Drosophila, for
example [42]).
As there is an intuitive link between the frequency of symbiotic infection and the overall importance of symbionts
in arthropod biology, some comment on the true incidence level of these bacteria is appropriate. Given that we
have tested against the presence of false positives in the

Page 7 of 12
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Biology 2008, 6:27

PCR assay by obtaining product sequence in all cases, we
would emphasise that our estimate underscores true incidence. Two main sources of underestimation of incidence
are inherent in our survey. First, there is the possibility of
false negatives in the PCR assay. These would be individuals (and, hence, species) in our sample that are in fact
infected, but where infection has not been detected. Second, there are species where the PCR assay was accurate
and our samples were truly uninfected, but other members
of the species, not sampled and tested, are in fact infected.
We would argue that both of these factors lead to a considerable underestimation of the frequency of infection.
False negatives with respect to undetected presence in
infected samples are an issue with PCR assays, their sensitivity to titre and their ability to detect diverse infections.
For Wolbachia, for instance, our use of a PCR assay based
on 16S rDNA is likely to include most of the Wolbachia
diversity. For Rickettsia, we would note that whereas we
found no Rickettsia infection among spiders, Goodacre et
al. [24] used PCR primers with a broader 'catch' and
reported 19.7% of species to be infected by Rickettsia
strains related only distantly to Rickettsia MK strains.
These are likely to be inherited bacteria, and possibly
reproductive parasites, but they would not be detected in
our screen. Furthermore, we probably also underestimated the number of bacterial strains present in species
we found to be infected. Given that our survey is in most
cases based on PCR amplification of fragments of the slow
evolving 16S rDNA sequence, we had limited power to
detect multiple infections of closely related bacterial
strains. For instance, the 16S rDNA sequences of Wolbachia infecting the mosquito Culex pipiens are well known
to be strictly identical, suggesting that only one Wolbachia
strain could occur, but sequencing of faster evolving genes
has demonstrated the occurrence of more than 60 Wolbachia strains in this host species [43-45].
The second issue that causes an underestimation of the
frequency of these agents is failing to sample an infected
individual in an infected species. There are two aspects to
this, the first being cases where infections are rare within
a population. For example, MK infections tend to exist at
low prevalence and examples of infection at between 1%
and 10% frequency in females represent about one-half of
all known infections [46]. Within our survey, we sampled
two species in which just 1 of 20 individuals was infected,
which clearly indicates the potential for false negatives
arising from low prevalence infection. The second cause of
failure to sample an infected individual arises from infection presence varying from population to population. We
sampled seven species from several localities and revealed
three examples of the presence or absence variation
between populations within Western Europe. Such geographical variation is not uncommon [47], and is likely to
be much greater when the scale of sampling is increased

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/27

beyond Western Europe (which because of the recent ice
age represents one recently recolonised region in ecological terms). Insufficient geographical sampling will lead to
serious underestimation of infection incidence.
Overall, therefore, our point estimate of 32.4% of species
infected with bacteria allied to reproductive parasites is
likely to seriously underestimate the true figure. Our data
improve on past surveys by increasing the intensity of
sampling within species. For instance, for the case of Wolbachia, resampling our data (taking one individual from
each species that is infected with a probability of infection
given by the overall prevalence found) indicates that the
move from single individual sampling to our modest multiple individual sampling reveals around one-third more
cases of infection: the median Wolbachia incidence on
sampling one individual per species is 17.6%, rather than
the observed 22.8%. However, the sample size within
each species is still limited and, most importantly, the
restriction in geographical sampling may produce a very
serious underestimation of symbiont presence or absence.
We obtained some insight into the degree to which host
taxa vary in the frequency of their interaction with inherited bacteria. The depth of conclusion is very limited by
virtue of the intensity of sampling within particular clades
in a broad survey. Nevertheless, spiders (the Araneae) harboured a higher richness of inherited bacteria than others
and represented diversity hotspots for these bacteria with
61.5% of species infected, contrasting to the relatively low
incidence observed within Diptera and Coleoptera. The
Araneae hotspot was present for Wolbachia, Cardinium and
S. ixodetis, although not for Arsenophonus. Why some
arthropod taxa are hotspots for inherited bacteria remains
one of the most challenging questions with regard to the
ecology of reproductive parasites. Certain taxa are clearly
more susceptible to acquiring bacteria via horizontal
transfer and/or to stably maintaining infection. Given that
cocladogenesis is rare, it is the establishment of new infections that appears important in dictating incidence [48].
Intimate contact with other species is likely to predispose
to transfer, be this parasitism, predation, physical damage
or becoming prey [49-53]. Indeed, species which include
other living arthropods in their diet through predation or
parasitism are more frequently infected (43.8%) than
other species (26.1%; P = 0.05, Fisher's exact test). As a
result, predation and/or parasitism could be an efficient
transfer mechanism to elucidate the origin of hotspots, as
illustrated by Araneae, which is exceptional because all
species of this group depend completely on predation of
other invertebrates which are largely polyphagous [54].
An alternative hypothesis to account for heterogeneity of
endosymbiont incidence among host clades is based on
differences in host phylogenies [55], but this does not
seem to be a likely explanation for the Araneae.

Conclusion
We hope that this paper has established that Wolbachia
and Cardinium are not alone: S. ixodetis and Arsenophonus
relatives also exist in appreciable numbers of arthropod
species. Perhaps the most important consideration for the
future is not the incidence of infection, but phenotype.
Whilst there have been detailed studies of Wolbachia and
Cardinium in a variety of arthropods, there has been little
work on the other pair of 'common' symbionts, S. ixodetis
relatives and Arsenophonus. S. ixodetis relatives are known
to be MKs in ladybirds [56,57] and butterflies [58,59], but
have also been isolated from ticks [60] and aphids [61],
where they do not kill males. A. nasoniae was established
as the MK of the wasp N. vitripennis [62] but other strains
of Arsenophonus isolated from a divergent range of arthropods show no evidence of sex-ratio distortion activity
[21,23]. The S. ixodetis and Arsenophonus strains isolated in
our study do not show evidence of MK behaviour as they
are present in both males and females. It is very likely that
these symbionts represent important understudied components of arthropod biology. We would advocate an
open approach to their biology; they may cause cytoplasmic incompatibility, but may also be secondary symbionts that could be conditionally beneficial, and their
presence in bacterial clades containing reproductive parasites would be of great interest. It is also possible that horizontal (infectious) transmission plays a larger role in the
population biology of these infections than is usually perceived. Sexual transmission of aphid secondary symbionts
[63] and transmission on coparasitisation for Arsenophonus [31] make this avenue worthy of investigation. If
biologists are to understand the role that inherited bacteria play in arthropod evolution, a thorough examination
with respect to documenting their effects is now required.
