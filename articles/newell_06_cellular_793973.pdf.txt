Abstract
We hypothesize that the energy strategy of a cell is a key factor for determining how, or if, the
immune system interacts with that cell. Cells have a limited number of metabolic states, in part,
depending on the type of fuels the cell consumes. Cellular fuels include glucose (carbohydrates),
lipids (fats), and proteins. We propose that the cell's ability to switch to, and efficiently use, fat for
fuel confers immune privilege. Additionally, because uncoupling proteins are involved in the fat
burning process and reportedly in protection from free radicals, we hypothesize that uncoupling
proteins play an important role in immune privilege. Thus, changes in metabolism (caused by
oxidative stresses, fuel availability, age, hormones, radiation, or drugs) will dictate and initiate
changes in immune recognition and in the nature of the immune response. This has profound
implications for controlling the symptoms of autoimmune diseases, for preventing graft rejection,
and for targeting tumor cells for destruction.

Review
The immune system, a complex organization of cells, tissues and organs, serves to protect us from potential harm.
Extraordinary advances in our understanding of the
immune system have been made in the last hundred
years, especially since the discovery of T and B lymphocytes [1]. Nonetheless, fundamental questions remain
unanswered. One of these unanswered questions concerns the nature of "immune privilege". It is widely
accepted that certain tissues (brain, eye, ovary, testes)
interact differently with the immune system compared to
most other tissues. These tissues are commonly termed
"immune privileged" [2], however the basis for the privilege is unknown. The purpose of this report is to suggest a
mechanism that accounts for immune privilege.

We recognize that immune privilege is a topic of ongoing
discussion. For example, the role of FasL, Transforming
Growth Factor beta (TGF-beta), IL-4, and IL-10, among
others, have been widely discussed [3,4]. Some recent
work relating the cell surface expression of FasL with metabolic intermediates, including cyclooxygenase-2, is consistent with both our hypothesis as discussed below and
the involvement of FasL in immune privilege[5].
Recognition of antigen by T lymphocytes (T cells) and the
subsequent activation of the T cell, are crucial steps within
the immune response and immune recognition. Naïve Tcells require at least two signals for activation. These are
recognition of antigens in Major Histocompatibility Complex-encoded (MHC) molecules [6], and a co- stimulation
signal [7-9] provided by the B7/CD28 family members or

chondrial membrane that contributes to an electrochemical "proton motive force" across the membrane, an
electron transport chain along the inner membrane, and
respiratory complexes within the inner membrane. Oxygen complexes are used to facilitate the electron flow, with
the terminal reaction involving the reduction of molecular oxygen to water. Thus normal by-products of energy
production are reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI).

Metabolic modification of cell surface Fas expression
Metabolic modification of cell surface Fas expression.
Changes in expression of Fas caused by removing glucose or
adding insulin to the culture medium. The glucose is removed
by incubating HL60 (human promyelocytic leukemia) cells in
glucose free RPMI with the addition of 5 mM 2-Deoxyglucose. When cells were incubated with insulin, normal RPMI
medium conditions were used with the addition of 100 µg/
mL of insulin. The above conditions represent a 24 hour
treatment period. This data is representative of five separate
experiments. Each of the experiments showed the same general trends, however the experiments were done at different
times and because the intensity of the fluorochromes varies
with time, this makes direct statistical comparisons suspect.
The level of Fas was detected using PE-conjugated antihumanFas (CD95) antibodies (Pharmingen, California) and
measured using a Coulter Elite Epics Flow Cytometer (Coulter, Hialeah, Florida) and FlowJo analysis software (Tree Star,
Inc, Oregon).

other co-stimulatory molecules such as Fas (CD95) or
CD40. Previously activated T cells can be reactivated by
co-stimulation alone [10,11]. In the absence of activation,
T-cells do not respond to self tissue, i.e. the T cells tolerate
the tissue. The consequences of T cell activation include:
1. destruction of damaged cells [12,13], or 2. repair of
damaged cells by promoting regeneration either directly
or indirectly [14-16].

The connection between cellular metabolism
and immune privilege
We hypothesize that energy metabolism has a primary
influence on the presence or absence of both T cell activation signals and thus regulates "immune privilege". What
do we mean by energy metabolism? In non-dividing cells,
mitochondria normally provide over 90% of cellular ATP.
The details of this energy storage process are complex, but
there are key parameters that control ATP production.
These include: a proton gradient across the inner mito-

We have observed that the choice of fuel (glucose and/or
lipid) used for mitochondrial metabolism, is part of a
metabolic behavior that regulates the interaction of the
cell with other cells, including cells of the immune system
[17,18]. We propose that there are at least two metabolic
base states. Immune-sensitive cells use carbon atoms
derived primarily from glucose for fuel in the mitochondria, exhibit relatively high mitochondrial membrane
potential, may have increased levels of cell surface MHC,
are easily damaged by free radicals (including excessive
reactive oxygen intermediates), and may show increased
levels of cell surface co-stimulatory molecules. Immunesensitive cells are thus defined as cells that interact readily
with the immune system. This can include homeostasis
[19], regenerative growth nurtured by the immune system
[15,16], or immune-induced death of infected or damaged cells [12]. In contrast, immune-privileged cells preferentially use lipids for fuel, have a lower mitochondrial
membrane potential, are less likely to express cell surface
MHC molecules, are less easily, or are more resistant to,
damage caused by free radicals, and have relatively lower
levels of co-stimulatory molecules.
As evidence for this idea, we observe that some cells predominantly use carbon atoms derived from glucose as
fuel in the mitochondria (leukocytes, hepatocytes, epithelial cells, regenerating tissues, and many drug sensitive
tumors) [20-23] while other types of cells (brain, pancreatic beta cells, muscle, eye, drug-resistant tumors) can use
glucose or lipids. The first group of cells has been shown
to be readily recognized by the immune system, while the
second group is considered immune-privileged [2].

Factors affecting metabolism and
immunological signals
Not surprisingly, control of the first and second activation
signals for the immune-sensitive cells may also be metabolically based. For example, it is known that MHC class
II cell surface expression, a requirement for signal one,
increases during inflammation and inflammation correlates with local changes in metabolism [24]. We propose
that fuel consumption and energy production in the cell
control the production of free radicals. The existence of
intracellular free radicals, in turn, is associated with
changes in the level of MHC class II expressed on the cell
surface [24] and with modifying or inducing the second

signal [25]. Thus cellular metabolism may affect how, the
immune system "sees", recognizes and responds to, a
given cell or tissue.

ibility of the melanoma cells to cells of the immune
system, particularly to cells expressing cell surface Fas ligand (FasL), because these cells could potentially induce
apoptosis. A similar increase in Fas expression has been
observed in other cell lines, including L1210 and its drug
resistant counterpart L1210DDP, when exposed to etomoxir.

There are a wide variety of extrinsic factors – chemotherapeutic agents, anti-metabolites, insulin, glucose, fatty
acids, nerve (and other) growth factors, oxidative stressors
(hypoxia, hyperoxia), and low intensity microwaves –
that are known to alter the metabolic strategy of the cell.
In each case there is a corresponding change in the immunological signals the cells presents to T lymphocytes. The
pharmacologic mechanism of many drugs is based on
interfering with cellular metabolism [26]. We, and others,
have found that chemotherapeutic agents, including
methotrexate and adriamycin, modify the levels of cell
surface expression of the costimulatory molecules B7.1
(CD80), B7.2 (CD86), and Fas (CD95) on drug-treated
cells [17,26]. In most cases, the level of B7.1 is at least
doubled.

Increasing a cell's visibility to the immune system can
result in a variety of immune responses. These include the
release of different types of cytokines that could differentially promote either growth or death of the recognized
tissue. In addition, signals resulting from cell to cell contact may also be involved in a cells decision to either grow
or to undergo apoptosis. Members of the nerve growth
factor/nerve growth factor receptor families, including Fas
and Fas Ligand, are well established mediators of both
growth and death signals [15,16,30,31].

Metabolic states and uncoupling proteins
A surplus or a deficit of specific nutrients also affects
metabolism. For example, addition of insulin can reduce
levels of Fas ten-fold [27]! Similarly, cells incubated in
medium where glucose has been removed, also show substantial reductions in cell surface Fas, (Figure 1). In contrast, when glucose levels are increased above normal
levels, cell surface Fas expression increases [28]. These
data provide direct evidence that changes in metabolism
can make a cell less visible to the immune system and thus
confer immune privilege.
Additional support for our model is seen with immune
privileged cells. Many types of cancer cells are effectively
immune privileged. Among cancer cells, melanoma is
well-characterized as an immunologically silent tumor
[28]. Because melanoma cells have been shown to preferentially utilize fat for fuel [18], their low immunogenicity
is consistent with a model in which immune privilege correlates with the ability to use, or even choose to use, fat as
a source of fuel.
An important question is whether interfering with the
process of burning fat removes the immune privilege, thus
making melanoma cells more visible to the immune system. We demonstrate such a change in immunogencity by
treating melanoma cells with etomoxir, an inhibitor of
carnitine palmitoyl transferase (CPT) [29]. CPT is
required for the transport of fatty acyl residues into the
mitochondria, thus, treating cells with etomoxir essentially blocks the ability of the mitochondria to use carbon
atoms derived from fatty acids [29]. When B16F1
melanoma cells are incubated in medium containing 50
µg/mL, 100 µg/ml, and 250 µg/ml of etomoxir, we
observe a dose dependent increase in cell surface Fas (Figure 2). The expression of cell surface Fas increases the vis-

We suggest that uncoupling proteins (UCPs) are a part of
the mechanism controlling the change from one metabolic strategy to another. Uncoupling proteins are a family of molecules, first described in brown adipose tissue,
that function as a metabolic switch [32,33]. These proteins have been shown to produce the following metabolic changes: dissipation of the mitochondrial proton
gradient, thermogenesis, in the case of UCP 1 [32], lowering of mitochondrial membrane potential; induction of a
metabolic shift to fatty acids as a carbon source of fuel in
mitochondria [18]; promotion of high rates of glucose
utilization in the cytosol and increased oxygen consumption in the mitochondria and protection from reactive
oxygen intermediates. Clearly, there is a striking similarity
between the known changes in metabolic activity produced by uncoupling proteins and the metabolic features
associated with immune privilege.
In addition to the evidence described above, other recent
studies also support this model. The characterization of
two distinct cellular metabolic strategies has recently been
used to distinguish drug-sensitive from drug-resistant
tumor cells [18]. Furthermore, several studies have documented differences between the cell surface expression of
important immune molecules (such as MHC class I and II,
Fas, and B7 family members) on drug-sensitive compared
to drug-resistant tumor cells [17,18,34]. The concept of
two basal metabolic states that affect immune recognition
is further supported by observations that drug-sensitive
cells expressing immune molecules die by apoptosis more
readily than drug resistant cells. The activity of uncoupling
proteins, along with the existence of distinct metabolic
states, may provide the causal link between these observations.

Danger hypothesis could apply for both immune-privileged and immune-sensitive tissues. However, in
immune-privileged cells, there is a mechanism to reduce
the likelihood of the Danger signal, resulting in a reduced
capacity for co-stimulation.

Figure 2

Inhibition of CPT induces increased cell surface Fas expresInhibition of CPT induces increased cell surface Fas
expression. Levels of cell surface Fas on B16F1 melanoma
cells in cultures with different concentrations of Etomoxir
for 24 hours. Etomoxir blocks the mitochondria from using
carbons from fat as fuel. Fas levels, normally low in
melanoma cells, rise in the cells treated with Etomoxir. At a
concentration of 500 µg/mL all the cells died. The level of Fas
was detected using PE-conjugated anti-mouse Fas (CD95)
antibodies (Pharmingen, California) and measured using a
Coulter Elite Epics Flow Cytometer (Coulter, Hialeah, Florida) and FlowJo analysis software (Tree Star, Inc, Oregon).

Extending the Danger model, we suggest a change in
metabolism can lead to a change (either an increase or a
decrease) in the number of free radicals in the cell and
this, in turn, leads to a change in the level of the co-stimulatory signal and MHC class II expression. Recent work
demonstrating that high levels of ambient glucose result
in an increase in intracellular free radicals, e.g. reactive
oxygen [27], supports a portion of this hypothesis. We,
and others, have directly shown that reactive oxygen
impacts the expression of both B7 family members and
Fas (CD95) [36]. Clearly, these data provide substantial
evidence for the link between metabolism and immune
recognition.
As a point of clarification, because all cells use both glucose and lipids, it is not the choice of fuel, alone, which
determines whether a cell is immune-privileged or not.
Our model proposes it is the switch from using carbon
atoms derived from glucose as the primary fuel in the
mitochondria, to using lipids as the primary fuel, accompanied by the shift in metabolic parameters described
above, that results in a cell being less visible to the
immune system.

If uncoupling proteins play a critical role in creating the
two distinct metabolic states, one would expect significant
differences in the behavior of UCP in cells with different
metabolic states. To observe any differences in the distribution of UCP2, we transfected metabolically distinct
cells with green fluorescent protein labeled UCP2 (Figure
3). Confocal micrographs of L1210 cells, (predominantly
use glucose for fuel), and L1210 DDP cells, (readily burn
fat for fuel), show a clear difference in the distribution of
UCP2. L1210 DDP cells have substantial UCP2 within the
cell, in contrast to L1210 cells that have detectable UCP2
only on or near the cell surface. L1210 are rapidly dividing
cells and L1210 DDP are slowly dividing cells. The slowly
dividing cells have no cell surface Fas [17]. In contrast, the
rapidly dividing cells have significant levels of cell surface
Fas. Taken together these data suggest a correlation
between subcellular distribution of UCP2 and cell surface
Fas expression.

Conclusion: Implications of the model

Immune privilege and the danger model

If our hypothesis is correct it allows some speculation
regarding our inability to regenerate most organs and
limbs. It is known that immune-privileged tissues (which
do not normally express cell surface MHC) do not regenerate easily. It is interesting to note that the appearance of
MHC on the phylogenetic tree occurred in the evolution-

We comment on the connection between our hypothesis
and the Danger model [35], a paradigm that argues that
intrinsic or extrinsic stresses on a cell produce a danger signal, which results in the expression of co-stimulation molecules. Our model of immune privilege suggests that the

This connection between cell metabolism and the
immune system is profound. If we can change how the
immune system recognizes a cell, we may be able to direct
the immune system to ignore, destroy, repair, or regenerate the recognized cell. This is, for example, especially
important for controlling autoimmune diseases such as
multiple sclerosis (MS) and rheumatoid arthritis where
the goal is to prevent the immune system from attacking
our own tissue. In fact, our model could explain the observation that reducing caloric intake lessens autoimmune
symptoms [37,38]. Similarly, inducing different changes
in cellular metabolic activity might provide a strategy for
destruction of tumor cells. Finally, changes in metabolism
could produce changes in signal one and signal two,
which could lead to repair and regeneration of neurons.
This could be very important in helping stroke victims or
people with spinal cord injuries.

In conclusion, we propose an intimate connection
between cellular energetics and how the immune system
responds to an individual cell. If true, this could have a
major impact on the treatment of many diseases ranging
from cancer to multiple sclerosis.

the brain and coincidentally to express MHC. Did we

MHC or antigen?

References

We have proposed that different metabolic base states,
which have distinct metabolic strategies, determine
whether a cell has immune privilege or not. One way to
test this idea is to create immune-privileged cells by transfecting the gene encoding an uncoupling protein accompanied by an inducible promoter. This process would
allow the expression of UCP to be turned on and off on
cue – effectively creating immune-privileged cells when
UCP is on. We could then stress cells (with and without
UCP) and see if the levels of co-stimulatory molecules are
lower on the immune-privileged cells as compared to the
normal cells. Extending this approach, we could test the
ability of transfected or non-transfected cells to present
antigens to antigen-specific T cells. If the hypothesis is correct, the immune-privileged cells will be less capable of
activating T cells.

There are also in vivo tests for the hypothesis. For example,
we know that immune mediated rejection is the key problem for successful transplants. As described above, we
could transfect stem cells with the gene for UCP, theoretically creating an immune-privileged stem cell. Our model
would predict that if these cells were transplanted into an
allogeneic recipient, rejection would not occur.
