Abstract
Background: If mutation within the coding region of the genome is largely not adaptive, the ratio of nonsynonymous
(dN) to synonymous substitutions (dS) per site (dN/dS) should be approximately equal among closely related species.
Furthermore, dN/dS in divergence between species should be equivalent to dN/dS in polymorphisms. This hypothesis is
of particular interest in closely related members of the Bovini tribe, because domestication has promoted rapid
phenotypic divergence through strong artificial selection of some species while others remain undomesticated. We
examined a number of genes that may be involved in milk production in Domestic cattle and a number of their wild
relatives for evidence that domestication had affected molecular evolution. Elevated rates of dN/dS were further queried
to determine if they were the result of positive selection, low effective population size (Ne) or reduced selective
constraint.
Results: We have found that the domestication process has contributed to higher dN/dS ratios in cattle, especially in
the lineages leading to the Domestic cow (Bos taurus) and Mithan (Bos frontalis) and within some breeds of Domestic cow.
However, the high rates of dN/dS polymorphism within B. taurus when compared to species divergence suggest that
positive selection has not elevated evolutionary rates in these genes. Likewise, the low rate of dN/dS in Bison, which has
undergone a recent population bottleneck, indicates a reduction in population size alone is not responsible for these
observations.
Conclusion: The effect of selection depends on effective population size and the selection coefficient (Nes). Typically
under domestication both selection pressure for traits important in fitness in the wild and Ne are reduced. Therefore,
reduced selective constraint could be responsible for the observed elevated evolutionary ratios in domesticated species,
especially in B. taurus and B. frontalis, which have the highest dN/dS in the Bovini. This may have important implications
for tests of selection such as the McDonald-Kreitman test. Surprisingly we have also detected a significant difference in
the supposed neutral substitution rate between synonymous and noncoding sites in the Bovine genome, with a 30%
higher rate of substitution at synonymous sites. This is due, at least in part, to an excess of the highly mutable CpG
dinucleotides at synonymous sites, which will have implications for time of divergence estimates from molecular data.

Background
Domestication implies a period of intense phenotypic
selection that should result in dramatic changes to specific
areas of the genome. Therefore, one might expect to see a
signature of selection in the DNA sequence of domestic
species as measured by the ratio of nonsynonymous to
synonymous substitutions per site (dN/dS) [1].
The McDonald-Kreitman test [2] compares the dN/dS rate
in the divergence between species to the dN/dS rate in
common polymorphisms on the assumption that the latter represents the rate in neutral mutations. In this paper
we extend previous findings [3] by comparing the dN/dS
rate among 14 closely related species of bovid with the
dN/dS rate in polymorphisms from B. taurus. Another
neutral estimate of dN/dS mutations [3] has been developed that is based on ancestral polymorphisms in coding
regions that have undergone lineage sorting which were
found to be neutral. We compare the dN/dS rate at these
aberrant sites with that observed between species and
breeds of bovid. Specifically we wish to test the hypothesis
that domestication increases dN/dS either in general, or at
least in some genes.
The Bovinae subfamily is a useful group in which to study
molecular evolution as it encompasses several domestic
species and a number of wild relatives that have experienced very little or no domestication, which all diverged
from a common ancestor ~10–15MYA. Table 1 presents a
summary of the animals in our study; their classification
and whether they have been subject to large scale domes-

tication. Of the Bovinae representatives, Domestic cattle
(Bos taurus) are amongst the most developed by domestication and artificial (positive) selection. Archaeological
and genetic data suggest the domestication of B. taurus
occurred approximately ten thousand years ago and that it
was limited to just a few events in the Fertile Crescent and
North Africa [4-6]. Since that time domesticated cattle
have experienced various selective pressures that have
resulted in major phenotypic shifts for a range of traits.
For example, selection for better lactation ability and persistence, primarily over the past 5,000 years, has increased
milk production [1,7]. This selection has increased dramatically for dairy breeds like Holstein over the last 50
years with the use of artificial insemination, all of which
have contributed to a large increase in cattle numbers and
a significant decrease in effective population size [8].
Thus, genes suspected of being involved with increased
milk production in B. taurus should be good targets for
identifying positive selection that may have resulted from
domestication.
Because of the cost of sequencing, only a limited number
of genes could be analysed from genomic DNA. Therefore,
a candidate gene approach was used to identify genes that
may be involved in milk production. In this study genes
that underlie putative QTL in Holstein for milk production traits from 20 centiMorgan (cM) regions on Bovine
chromosomes 1, 2, 6, 9 and 26 were examined [9-11] and
hence should give a representative look at a wide sample
of genes from the cattle genome. Additional genes were
examined from previous work on lactation-associated

genes with high expression in the mammary gland and
relatively rapid rates of evolution for pairwise comparisons between human and cattle [12]. These genes were
mapped to regions of Bovine chromosomes 14 and 21
and did not underlie QTL. A more detailed description of
the genes, species sampled and their phylogenetic relationships have been described previously [3].
In the present study, genomic DNA variation is analysed
from 15 autosomal genes within and between 14 closely
related representatives of the Bovinae subfamily in an
effort to determine if selective or demographic processes
(eg changes in effective population size) governed molecular evolution in Domestic cattle and whether the domestication process was associated with increased rates of
molecular evolution. Therefore, dN/dS ratios calculated
for divergence, polymorphism and ancestral polymorphisms were used to identify rapid molecular evolution in
specific lineages, genes and in domestic vs undomesticated animals.

Results
Differences between genes and species in the rate of
evolution from ancestral to extant species
We sequenced 84 amplicons from 15 autosomal genes in
14 representatives of the Bovinae subfamily resulting in
~52,800 base pairs of sequence in each species, which we
have submitted to Genbank [3]. The sequence of the common ancestor was inferred and used to count the synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions between the
ancestral sequence and each extant species. An analysis of
variance tested the significance of differences in the rate of
evolution on the 14 branches of the evolutionary tree
(analysis GLM1 in Methods). Table 2 shows a summary of
the p-values from the analysis of variance. Pairwise comparisons between the ancient and contemporary samples
in GLM 1 yielded significant (p < 0.05) effects for amplicon (a) for all of the variables tested. However, difficulties
arise with this analysis due to the lack of independence for
substitutions between lineages. Because some mutations
have occurred in a common co-ancestor, these mutations

be anti-conservative. This problem does not affect the Ftest for gene because it compares gene and amplicon
within gene mean squares (see Methods). That is, we test
if the difference between genes is greater than the variation between amplicons within genes. Significant gene
effects were detected for dN and dN/(dN+dS). Thus, different genes have accumulated different numbers of
amino acid changing mutations, which may be due to different levels of selective constraint. Table 3 presents the
estimated effects for GLM 1 examining the variation in
genes for dN and dN/(dN+dS). Amongst the most rapidly
evolving genes are 5HT1F and EGF, while the slowest
evolving genes are IGFBP2 and IGFBP5.
Surprisingly, a significant difference between species for
the assumed neutral mutation rate in dS and dI was
detected. The differences between species for dS were
found to be restricted to the Water buffalo, which show a
significantly higher rate of silent site evolution, while the
breeds of B. taurus were amongst the lowest when compared to the ancestral sequence. The significant effect
detected in species for the number of intronic substitutions per site (dI) was the result of a higher rate of substitution in the Eland lineage (results not shown). This is
likely an anomaly in the ancestral sequence, as the Eland
outgroup's divergence time from the ancestral sequence is
not similar to other members of the Bovini tribe.
The rate of radical (Dr) to conservative mutations (Dc)
was not significantly different between genes or species,

In figure 1 we present a partial phylogenetic reconstruction from over 21,000 noncoding sites and 1,500 substitutions at these sites. As can be seen in the phylogenetic
tree one river buffalo (BubB) appears to be more closely
related to a swamp buffalo (BubC) than to other river buffalo, which may be due to recent introgression with a
swamp buffalo. Despite this anomaly, the majority of spe-

details regarding the relationships between these animals
can be found in MacEachern et al [3]. We also compare
the neutral phylogenetic tree with the variation found at
amino acids with the number of amino acid changing
mutations per site (dN). The highest number of amino
acid changes per site identified was in Holstein (Figure 1,

selection (Holstein and Hereford or Murrah, Asian water
and swamp buffalo) have accumulated more amino acid
changes than less intensely selected breeds (Tuli and the
nondescript breed of Indian water buffalo or species like
the African buffalo). However, as described in GLM 1
(Table 2) these differences between species are not quite
significant. Surprisingly, the dN rate in Gaur is higher than
Mithan, suggesting a faster mutation rate in this species.
The model GLM 2 (see Methods) tested the interaction
between gene and species (g.s) on rates of evolution. No
significant interaction was detected between gene and species for any of the dependent variables, indicating that the
differences detected for genes in GLM 1 were not particular to any one species. Therefore, high substitution or evolutionary rates for a given gene were common across the
entire phylogeny and the differences in evolutionary rate
between genes were most likely a result of different levels
of selective constraint amongst genes rather than species.
Comparison of substitutions at synonymous and
noncoding sites and CpG dinucleotides
Synonymous and noncoding sites were examined for differences in the number of substitutions per site (dS and dI,
respectively). We identified a significant difference
between the number of substitutions per site for dS and
dI, with a significantly higher rate of substitution detected
at synonymous sites. Overall a ~30% higher rate of substitution at synonymous sites was detected, which was determined to be significant (p < 0.001). An examination of
whether CpG dinucleotides were over represented in substitutions at synonymous or noncoding sites uncovered a
significantly higher proportion of silent substitutions at
synonymous sites that involve CpG dinucleotides than at
noncoding sites (Table 4, p < 0.001). The difference
between synonymous and noncoding substitutions per
site decreases when substitutions involving CpG dinucleotides are removed from the analysis with only a 10%
higher rate of substitution at synonymous sites, however,
this difference is still significant (Table 4, p < 0.001).

Genetic distance between species and breeds
Pairwise comparisons for dI and dS between all 14 Bovini
representatives are given in table 5. The lowest values are
for comparisons within a species (i.e. within Indian water
buffaloes or within Bos taurus) and the highest are
between Eland and other species. This finding is also represented graphically in figure 2, with a significant linear
relationship identified between dS and dI for pairwise
comparisons summed across all genes. The simplest
explanation is that both dI and dS are largely neutral substitutions that accumulate over greater evolutionary time.

In table 6 the pairwise comparisons for dN/dS and dN are
presented, lower and upper diagonal, respectively. The
patterns of divergence for dN are similar to those found
for dI and dS with the smallest values found between
breeds of Domestic cattle and buffalo, while the largest
values were consistently found between species. Pairwise
comparisons for dN/dS show a different pattern, with
some of the largest values detected between breeds of B.
taurus and other closely related species from the Bovina
subtribe. Interestingly, pairwise comparisons between
buffalo breeds or species that have been separated over
similar time frames often show much smaller evolutionary ratios (BubB vs BubC and Ind vs Mur)
A significantly negative relationship was found between
the evolutionary ratio (dN/dS) and the number of substitutions in noncoding DNA (dI) (Figure 3). The relationship appears to be quadratic, which suggests that there is
a relative abundance of dN:dS over short time scales and
that negative selection is more effective at removing deleterious mutations over increasing evolutionary time.
Thus, dN/dS is variable, but includes some high values
when dI is small. Conversely, at high dI, dN/dS is approximately 0.1.
Divergence, polymorphism and domestication
If selective constraint is reduced over small time scales
consistently higher rates of molecular evolution should be
seen between very closely related species. Likewise, if this
phenomenon is common for polymorphisms the highest
rates of evolution should be seen within species. Alterna-

Hereford, Mit: Mithan, Hol: Holstein, Syn: African buffalo, Tul: Tuli, and Yak)

undomesticated species. The values for dN/dS appear to
increase again when two domestic animals are compared
(Table 7, bottom right). In fact all dN/dS comparisons
with values > 0.15 involve one or two domestic species
(Table 7, bottom left and right).
Because the Bovini tribe diverged in a star like phylogeny
~2MYA [3], comparisons between undomesticated animals (Gaur vs Bison) should be comparable to domesticated species (Yak vs Mithan). However the high rates
detected between breeds of B. taurus could be the result of
changes in the time of divergence.

To examine if selective constraint in B. taurus had recently
been relaxed, we compared within species variation for
dN/dS between Domestic cattle and buffalo. High evolutionary rates were detected (Table 6, lower diagonal) for
Hereford vs Holstein and Hereford vs Tuli, with the highest ratio detected between Hereford and Tuli. In comparison, the evolutionary ratios for buffalo were generally
much smaller, with Ind vs Mur showing low evolutionary
ratios and BubB vs BubC showing the smallest evolutionary ratio. However, some large ratios were found in buffalo, highlighting the low accuracy of dN/dS ratios
between close relatives. If intense domestication and artificial selection in B. taurus is affecting dN/dS rates, then

a dN/dS rate of 0.065.

Pairwise comparisons in top left between 2 undomesticated animals,
bottom left between 1 domestic and one undomesticated animal, and
bottom right two domestic animals

dN/dS between breeds of Domestic cattle should be significantly larger than those detected between breeds of
buffalo. Therefore, we have tested for significance
between the ratio of nonsynonymous and synonymous
substitutions within both species. None of the comparisons were significant, however, a significant difference
was nearly detected for dN/dS between Hereford vs Tuli
and BubB vs BubC (Table 6, lower diagonal, χ2 test, p =
0.068).
Selection tests
Holstein polymorphism data was collected from 8 animals in an effort to detect if differences existed between
breeds of B. taurus that may be the result of recent artificial
selection. Table 8 summarises the number of polymorphisms and the evolutionary rate detected in Holsteins.
Only 3 nonsynonymous and 5 synonymous mutations
were found in the genes 5HT1F, 5HT6 and EGF. The dN/
dS ratio within Holstein is similar to that between breeds
of B. taurus. Both are higher than dN/dS in species divergence, so a McDonald-Kreitman test gives no evidence of
positive selection driving species divergence. This might
be because dN/dS within B. taurus is higher as a result of
ineffective negative or purifying selection.
Ancient polymorphisms
A number of neutral or nearly neutral substitutions were
identified from the dataset that appear to be the result of
homologous mutations in a common ancestor that have
subsequently been randomly assorted in modern species

The McDonald-Kreitman test was modified to compare
dN/dS between species to dN/dS in ancient polymorphisms on the assumption that the latter are neutral.
Table 9 shows the results of chi-squared tests in which
Ka:Ks in a series of species differences and species polymorphisms is compared to Ka:Ks in ancient substitutions.
In general, pairwise comparisons between Mithan and
other members of the Bovidae have higher dN/dS than the
rate in aberrant polymorphism, with significant differences detected between Mithan and Holstein cattle. This
finding could be mistaken as a sign of rapid evolution in
domestic cattle. However, examining the other pairwise
comparisons it appears that Mithan is generating the difference with near significant results for the majority of
members in the Bovidae (Table 9) and consistently large
evolutionary ratios (dN/dS) in table 6 (lower diagonal).
We also applied the test to identify differences in the rate
of polymorphism for B. taurus and B. bubalis. Comparisons of the polymorphisms within Domestic cattle and
Water buffalo with the rate of ancient polymorphisms
should help identify whether any differences in evolutionary rate can be attributed to a relaxation of selective constraint. A significant difference was detected for the
number of polymorphisms between Hereford and Tuli
when compared with the number of ancient polymorphisms (Table 9). The same comparison was made for
polymorphisms found between both types of Water buffalo (Ind vs Mur and BubB vs BubC); however, no significant differences were detected (results not shown).
Therefore, it appears that during the domestication of B.
taurus there has been an accumulation of nonsynonymous mutations above those found at aberrant sites,
which may result from an accumulation of deleterious
alleles associated with domestication and a relaxation of
selective constraint.

Discussion
Intronic and exonic substituion rates
Silent and neutral substitutions
Most sites in noncoding regions of the genome in mammals are generally thought to be free from selection and
thus both dI and dS are neutral and should accumulate at
similar rates [13-15]. In general, we have found that both
dI and dS behave in a neutral manner in that they do not

vary between genes and accumulate in a clock like fashion. However, dS were consistently higher than dI. A similar result has also been found in primates, with a 60%
higher substitution rate found at synonymous than noncoding sites [16]. The authors have argued that their finding was due to an overabundance of CpG dinucleotides,
which suffer higher mutation rates due to their methylation by methyltransferases. We confirmed this finding and
detected on average a 30% higher rate of silent substitution in coding regions than in noncoding sites and a significantly higher number of substitutions at synonymous
sites involving CpG dinucleotides than for noncoding
substitutions.
If CpG dinucleotides are ignored, dS and dI are still not
identical. Thus, some other force may play a role in reducing substitutions at noncoding sites in some of the genes
studied. The noncoding regions in this study include a
predominance of sequence adjacent to intron/exon
boundaries and 5' and 3'UTRs and some evidence exists
for the conservation of selected bases in these regions
[17]. The fact that dS does not vary per gene implies that
there is no selection for preferred codons in the Bovini
tribe for these genes, or that the selection pressure and
effective population size for members of the Bovini are so
small that dS is in fact behaving neutrally. This confirms
previous work [13-15,18] that has found similar silent
substitution rates per gene over a wide range of mammals.
Nonsynonymous substitutions and evolutionary ratios
A number of methods have been developed to identify
signatures of selection from the proportion of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions per site [19-25].
However, using a simple algorithm described by Nei and
Gojorbi [21] we have estimated dN and dS between various lineages in the Bovinae subfamily over dataset encompassing 15 autosomal genes. This algorithm should be
accurate as we detected no large bias for transitional to
transversional substitutions amongst bovids in our study.

Incorporating various lineages from the Bovinae subfamily in the test reduces the requirement of dN/dS ratios
to be above one, which is an unrealistic test for selection
[12].
Examining dN/dS ratios between bovid lineages has identified the importance of purifying selection during the
evolution of the Bovini, which presumably is the case in
other lineages, with all of the evolutionary ratios as measured by dN/dS being far below one. Despite the impact of
purifying selection, relatively rapid rates of evolution were
identified (i.e. high values of dN/(dN+dS)) in the genes
5HT1F, EGF, HFABP, NRIP1 and LACS3. These genes
come from a variety of positions in the genomes of the
Bovini. Therefore, rapid molecular evolution was not
localised to a given region or selection hot spot in the
genome and different levels of selective constraint appear
to be operating on genes that are separated by relatively
small distances.
The fact that the dN:dS ratio in the divergence between
species is significantly lower than that detected for within
species polymorphism, seems to confirm that positive
selection has not driven the evolution of these genes for
any of the species or breeds examined.
Members of the Bovini undoubtedly have undergone positive selection due to adaptation to their environments
and therefore should show signatures of adaptive molecular evolution due to natural selection. Because genes in
this study were selected for their potential role in milk
production, we suspected domestic species would show a
significantly larger rate of evolution than other species
from the Bovini tribe for these genes. However, little difference was identified between taxa, which may be due to
the small time over which domestication has occurred
and thus the small contribution it has likely made to the
differentiation between Bovini genomes. Also the substi-

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:179

tutions driven by positive selection appear to be a small
proportion of the total, and therefore difficult to detect.
Previous findings have identified a higher accumulation
of substitutions in recently diverged species (< 1–2 Mya)
when compared to species diverged for longer amounts of
time, which may be a result of polymorphisms and deleterious alleles contributing to the rate of short term divergence [26]. A negative relationship between the
evolutionary ratio (dN/dS) and time as represented by dS
and dI confirms that recently diverged species do in fact
harbour a higher proportion of dN to dS, with some of the
highest rates for species polymorphism. However, the
pairwise comparisons for dN/dS presented in table 6
(lower diagonal) show the highest contributors were
between and within breeds of Domestic cow, followed by
pairwise comparisons between closely related species and
breeds where at least one had a history of domestication
(i.e. Domestic cow, Mithan, Yak). This finding does not
appear to be repeated between animals separated over
similar time frames with no or little history of intensive
domestication. Thus, the increase in short term divergence
appears to be more pronounced in domestic species.
In a previous study [26] examined protein coding and dloop sequences from mitochondrial data in avian and primate lineages, while we have examined mutation and
substitution in nuclear genes. If any of the estimates in
[26] originated from a population that had undergone a
serious bottleneck in the past such as humans [27], the
effects for these populations may mimic those found for
domestication as it usually involves a reduction in effective population size, which leads to a less effective
response to selection and an increase in the fixation of
deleterious mutants [28-30]. However, many representatives of the Bovini have undergone major population bottlenecks, such as the Bison, which was nearly driven to
extinction in the late 1800's [31] and no increase is seen
for the rate of short term divergence. However, these population bottlenecks have occurred relatively recently in
comparison to humans. Thus, the dN/dS rate is high in
the recent evolution of Domestic cattle, Mithan and Yak
and remains high in polymorphisms in B. taurus. This
finding also appears to be true for humans [12], who have
gone through an ancient population bottleneck and a relatively recent population expansion, especially when low
frequency polymorphisms are not removed.
Evidence suggests that the accumulation of substitutions
in recently diverged species typically only applies to mitochondrial DNA [32-34], which is nonrecombining, maternally inherited and thus has a smaller effective population
size than genomic DNA. Therefore, deleterious alleles are
an important component of DNA polymorphism for
mitochondrial sequence, these deleterious mutations

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/179

appear to accumulate as polymorphisms, but do not contribute to species divergence due to negative selection
[35]. To our knowledge the finding of high dN/dS
between recently diverged species has never been reported
for nuclear DNA. However, we have identified a similar
phenomenon for domesticated animals at nuclear genes,
with a high evolutionary rate for polymorphisms between
breeds of domestic cow and an increased rate of evolution
between species for pairwise comparisons where at least
one domestic species was examined. This finding is most
likely associated with the reduction of selective constraint
and effective population size in domestic animals that has
decreased the efficacy of negative selection and increased
the rate of polymorphism and fixation of deleterious alleles. Previous studies in domestic rice have found an
increase in the accumulation of deleterious alleles [30],
and this also appears to be the case in cattle. Therefore,
these findings may have important consequences to anyone attempting to find signatures of positive selection
using a McDonald-Kreitman test from mitochondrial
DNA or tests using genomic polymorphism data from
domestic species. Therefore, the McDonald-Kreitman test
is probably not an appropriate test to identify positive
selection in domestic species because of the relaxed selective constraint that is associated with domestication. It
also appears that deleterious alleles can exist in a domestic
population at a high frequency without being fixed for
quite some time, and removing rare polymorphisms will
not automatically overcome this problem if the effective
population size is small. Therefore care should be taken
when inferring the neutral rate of mutation from polymorphism data in some species.
Ancient polymorphisms and lineage sorting, an alternative
to detecting rapid evolution from polymorphism data
Lineage sorting in closely related species is not an uncommon observation [36-38]. In the present study a number
of ancient polymorphisms in the coding regions of genes
were used to infer the neutral rate of evolution (dN/dS =
0.065). These substitutions most likely were polymorphic
in the ancestral population from which they were derived,
and in the absence of selection the probability of their loss
and fixation in future lineages is governed by the neutral
theory of molecular evolution [39]. Therefore, if the evolution of the majority of sites in the Bovini has been neutral the ratio of ancestral amino-acid to synonymous
polymorphism should be equal to the ratio in divergence
between any given species. Likewise, if selective constraint
has been reduced within a species a significantly higher
ratio in recent species polymorphism than in ancient polymorphism should be seen. Overall a significantly higher
rate of evolution in a number of pairwise comparisons
involving Mithan was detected with significant or nearly
significant differences detected between comparisons of
Mithan and Domestic cattle, Banteng and Gaur. There-

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:179

fore, it appears that there has been a relaxation of selective
constraint in the lineage leading to Mithan. We have also
confirmed previous findings by detecting relaxed selective
constraint in some breeds of B. taurus, with a significantly
higher ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous polymorphisms between Hereford and Tuli when compared to the
ratio in ancient polymorphisms and a nearly significant
difference detected between some breeds of buffalo. This
confirms our previous findings and suggests that intensive
domestication and strong artificial selection decreased
selective constraint and increased the number of amino
acid changing polymorphisms in Domestic cattle.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the rate of amino acid change (dN) and the
evolutionary ratio (dN/dS) was most influenced by the
gene and the exon sampled. Of the amino acid changing
mutations examined the majority were conservative
mutations and the ratio of radical to conservative mutations was not significantly different for any of the variables tested due to the relatively small number of radical
mutations. Different genes and regions within a gene may
experience different rates of mutation due to their roles,
expression patterns, position in the genome or protein
and differing levels of selective constraint which in turn
effects the rate of evolution, presumably due to differences in the level of selective constraint. Conversely, as
species diverge the small number of radical mutations
may be explained by the conservation of physiochemical
properties, which are often conserved to maintain protein
function even across evolutionary distant species [40].

Comparing the rate of polymorphism between breeds of
B. taurus and B. bubalis identified a higher accumulation of
nonsynonymous to synonymous mutation in B. taurus.
Mutation rates are thought to be elevated on smaller time
scales (i.e. within species) when compared to greater evolutionary distances between species as deleterious mutations can exist at moderate frequencies within species.
This phenomenon appears to be amplified in domestic
cattle. Therefore, tests that rely on within species polymorphism as a proxy for the neutral rate of evolution, like the
McDonald-Kreitman test, may not be suitable for domestic animals. Interestingly, the presence of ancient polymorphisms could be useful for detecting signatures of
selection at the molecular level. In that tests that mimic
the McDonald-Kreitman test by using ancestral polymorphism to infer the neutral mutation rate may be more useful for identifying rapid rates of molecular evolution
between closely related species. We have found that a
greater rate of nonsynonymous substitutions between
domestic and nondomestic species separated over similar
time frames. The rate of evolution when compared to the
neutral rate in polymorphism was not significant, however, in ancient polymorphisms we identified high evolu-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/179

tionary rates for dN/dS between domestic species for
divergence especially in Mithan and within Domestic cattle. This result implies that domestication reduces the
ability of animals to remove unfavourable mutations
from the population as they have very low Ne and are subject to strong artificial selection, which may have a role in
unintentionally increasing the number of deleterious
mutations. We believe this phenomenon will be common
in the coding sequences of domestic cattle and should not
be dependent on the methodology used to anlalyse
molecular evolution. However, future work may look at
applying codon based models such as those implemented
in PAML to identify individual sites that have been subject
to positive selection, which have undoubtedly occurred in
at least some genes during domestication. Although differentiating between positive selection and reduced selective constraint may be difficult.
Finally, we have also identified a significant difference in
the rate of substitution at synonymous and noncoding
sites in the Bovinae that is that is partially, but not completely, explained by CpG dinucleotide frequency differences. In particular, we have found that the number of
noncoding substitutions per site (dI) was significantly
smaller than the silent substitution rate dS, which appears
to be the result of a high proportion of CpG dinucleotides
at synonymous sites inflating the mutation rate and this
feature may have important consequences for estimating
divergence times between species at these sites.

Methods
Genes, species, breeds and animals
Candidate genes were selected using a priori knowledge of
the genes position in relation to suspected milk QTL, or
evidence of higher than average rates of molecular evolution for pairwise comparisons between Bos taurus, Homo
sapiens and Bos indicus [12,41]. In total 84 amplicons,
which typically consisted of exonic and flanking noncoding regions, were sequenced from the following 15 genes:
NRIP-1, PIT-1, ITGBP-5, 5-HT-1F, IGFBP-2, IGFBP-5, HFABP, LACS3, 5-HT-6, GMEB-1, EGF, ERA, PRRP, PABPC1 and MFGE8, in at least 1 individual from genomic DNA.
DNA was extracted from the following breeds and species
of cattle: 1 × Holstein (B. taurus), 1 × Tuli (B. taurus), 1 ×
Hereford (B. taurus), 2 × Banteng (B. javanicus), 2 × Gaur
(B. gaurus), 2 × Yak (B. grunniens), 1 × Mithan (B. frontalis), 2 × Bison (Bison bison), 1 × Murrah buffalo (Bubalus
bubalis), 1 × possible hybrid River/Swamp buffalo
(Bubalus bubalis/carabensis), 1 × Swamp buffalo (Bubalus
carabanesis), 2 × Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffar), 2 × Eland
(Taurotragus oryx) and 3 × nondescript breed of Indian
buffalo (Bubalus bubalis). Complete information on these
samples and sequences is detailed in MacEachern et al [3].
Polymorphism data was collected using between breed/
subspecies information for Water buffalo and Domestic

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:179

cattle. Polymorphism data was also obtained within
breeds using an additional 8 unrelated Holstein bulls,
which were sourced from Genetics Australia.
Sequence analysis
Consensus and ancestral sequences were generated using
computer modules written in PYTHON, which have been
described in detail [3]. For each amplicon the consensus
sequences from each representative of the Bovinae subfamily were aligned. Pipelines were developed to undertake pairwise comparisons between all samples to count
the number intronic/noncoding substitutions (Ki), nonsynonymous substitutions (Ka), synonymous substitutions (Ks), intronic substitutions per site (dI),
nonsynonymous substitutions per site (dN), synonymous
substitutions per site (dS) and the number of radical (Dr)
and conservative (Dc) substitutions. Exonic sequences
and the corresponding open reading frame (ORF) were
identified by cross-referencing alignments from known
Bovine and Human protein coding genes [12]. All information per amplicon was summed up per gene; therefore,
information has been collected for each exon, intron and
gene for all species successfully sequenced. Polymorphism information was retrieved from pairwise comparisons amongst breeds of B. taurus and B. bubalis and within
breeds of B. taurus for dI, dN, dS, Dr and Dc. To reduce the
chance of sequencing errors infiltrating our dataset, polymorphism data from heterozygous individuals was
ignored unless both alleles were also found in
homozygous form; alternatively the most frequent allele
was represented at that site.
Statistical analysis
Phylogenetic reconstruction
Phylogenetic trees were generated using the neighbour
joining algorithm and Kimura's two-parameter distance
using nonparametric bootstrapping with 5,000 replicates
from 21,055 base pairs of intronic sequence and 1,526
segregating sites in the MEGA4 package [15].
Detecting selection in the bovine lineage
Each species was compared to the inferred ancestral
sequence to determine whether various lineages had
evolved more rapidly than others. Thus, dN and dS were
calculated for each lineage in the phylogeny and internode divergence was compared between all lineages in the
tree. Evolutionary ratios varied greatly between genes and
amplicons often from 0 to infinity. Therefore, evolutionary ratios were calculated using the ratio dN/(dN+dS) and
Dr/(Dr+Dc) per exon and per gene.

Differences were examined using general linear models
(GLM) in GenStat for Windows 8th Edition. The first
model tested (GLM 1) was used to detect whether certain
amplicons or genes had evolved rapidly in certain species

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/179

since their divergence from the ancestral sequence. The
model tested was (1) y = μ + g + a + s + e where y = dN,
dS, dI, dN/(dN+dS) and Dr/(Dr+Dc), μ = the mean effect,
g = the effect for each gene, a = the effect of each amplicon
within gene, s = the effect of each species and e = the residual error. An F-test for gene was completed using the mean
square for gene divided by the mean square for amplicon
within gene to determine if gene effects were significant
above those detected for amplicon within gene.
Thus, if positive selection has driven the divergence in
Domestic cattle for some or all of the genes sequenced, a
significant effect for species should be seen, with the lineage leading to Bos taurus having significantly higher evolutionary rates when compared to other species. Typically
positive selection is inferred if dN/dS ratios are greater
than one. However, this is a conservative test for selection,
comparing dN and dS amongst closely replated species
tests neutrality by examining deviations within the phylogeny for the dN/dS ratio. Any deviations in dN/dS would
violate the strictly neutral model [42].
The second model (GLM 2) fitted the interaction between
gene and species to determine if particular species and
genes were responsible for the differences in the rates of
evolution detected in GLM 1. The model fitted was (2) y =
μ + g + s + g.s + e where the interaction g.s tests the difference between gene and species for rates of evolution.
Therefore, a significant interaction between (g.s) should
be detected if the differences between species vary from
one gene to the next. This may be evidence of positive
selection driving gene evolution in a particular species.
Comparison of synonymous and intronic sites
If selection operates on synonymous but not intronic substitutions a lower substitution rate at silent sites in exons
compared to substitutions at intronic sites would be
expected. An increase in the proportion of substitutions at
synonymous sites involving CpG dinucleotides when
compared to substitutions at noncoding sites has been
reported to increase dS in primate genomes [16]. To determine if this phenomenon was present in genomes from
the Bovini we examined substitutions at synonymous and
noncoding sites for differences in the relative number of
substitutions involving CpG dinucleotides. CpG dinucleotides were identified as a section of DNA where a cytosine then a guanine nucleotide occurs adjacent to each
other on the same DNA strand. CpG dinucleotides are
likely to mutate to TpG or CpA [16]. Hence, any substitution in the alignment involving a synonymous or noncoding site was determined to either involve a CpG
dinucleotide or not. A comparison of the number of substitutions per site involving CpG dinucleotides at synonymous and noncoding sites, such as those described above,
may explain any differences between substitution rates at

both sites. Substitutions were also compared between
noncoding and synonymous sites for non-CpG related
sites to determine if CpG related substitutions were
responsible for all the variation between sites.
Rate variation and relationships between substitution rates
Examining the relationships between various substitution
rates should be a quick reference to gauge the accuracy of
methods applied to estimate substitution and evolutionary ratios. Therefore, the relationships between substitution rates at different sites were compared by examining
the total numbers of substitutions that have accumulated
since the divergence from the ancestral sequence across all
15 genes for each species. Examining the relationship
between synonymous and noncoding substitutions per
site should show a strong correlation if substitutions at
both sites are neutral, and the relationship these neutral
sites have with the nonsynonymous substitutions and the
evolutionary ratio estimated across all genes (dN/dS)
should highlight how dN and dN/dS change over increasing evolutionary time.
Testing for selection or reduced selective constraint in domestic
animals
To test for evidence of rapid molecular evolution in
domestic animals contingency tables compared the ratio
of nonsynonymous mutations to synonymous mutations.
Comparisons were between an ancestral sequence and a
domesticated species with a closely related species that
has not been domesticated. If the observed substitutions
between the ancient and domestic animals are neutral the
ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous fixed differences
should be the same for domestic and wild animals when
compared to the ancestral sequence. Within species variation was also examined between B. taurus and B. bubalis. If
domestication has increased the rate of deleterious mutations in B. taurus the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous polymorphisms should be higher for comparisons
within B. taurus than for comparisons within B. bubalis.
Comparing inter-specific divergence and intra-specific polymorphism
Differences between lineages for the dN/dS ratio are deviations from neutral theory. However they may be caused
by positive selection or relaxed selective constraint, possibly as a result of the domestication of B. taurus. Analysing
species divergence and within species polymorphisms
should differentiate between the two. Therefore, evolutionary rates in divergence for pairwise comparisons
between each species and the Hereford genomic sequence
and the within species polymorphisms detected in 8 Holstein samples were compared using contingency tests.
Analysing pairwise comparisons between breeds of B. taurus with the polymorphism data collected within Holstein
animals should allow us to detect whether positive selec-

tion was responsible for driving the evolution in the coding sequence for these genes during their domestication.
Ancestral polymorphisms
The phylogenetic relationship of these samples identified
a number of variable sites that were abnormally inherited
within the Bovini tribe [3]. These aberrant sites appear to
have remained polymorphic for many generations and are
probably neutral or nearly neutral. Therefore, Ka and Ks at
these sites were compared to Ka and Ks found between
and within species using a modified McDonald-Kreitman
test [2] to identify possible signs of positive selection.
