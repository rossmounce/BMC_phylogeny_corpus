Animal HECT ubiquitin ligases: evolution and
functional implications
Ignacio Marín*

Abstract
Background: HECT ubiquitin ligases (HECT E3s) are key components of the eukaryotic ubiquitin-proteasome
system and are involved in the genesis of several human diseases. In this study, I analyze the patterns of
diversification of HECT E3s since animals emerged in order to provide the right framework to understand the
functional data available for proteins of this family.
Results: I show that the current classification of HECT E3s into three groups (NEDD4-like E3s, HERCs and singleHECT E3s) is fundamentally incorrect. First, the existence of a “Single-HECT E3s” group is not supported by
phylogenetic analyses. Second, the HERC proteins must be divided into two subfamilies (Large HERCs, Small HERCs)
that are evolutionarily very distant, their structural similarity being due to convergence and not to a common
origin. Sequence and structural analyses show that animal HECT E3s can be naturally classified into 16 subfamilies.
Almost all of them appeared either before animals originated or in early animal evolution. More recently, multiple
gene losses have occurred independently in some lineages (nematodes, insects, urochordates), the same groups
that have also lost genes of another type of E3s (RBR family). Interestingly, the emergence of some animal HECT
E3s precedes the origin of key cellular systems that they regulate (TGF-b and EGF signal transduction pathways;
p53 family of transcription factors) and it can be deduced that distantly related HECT proteins have been
independently co-opted to perform similar roles. This may contribute to explain why distantly related HECT E3s are
involved in the genesis of multiple types of cancer.
Conclusions: The complex evolutionary history of HECT ubiquitin ligases in animals has been deciphered. The
most appropriate model animals to study them and new theoretical and experimental lines of research are
suggested by these results.

Background
Ubiquitination is a critical process in all eukaryotic
organisms. It is involved in multiple essential functions,
from its best-known role in the regulation of protein
levels to additional, precise roles in endocytosis, cellular
signaling, DNA repair or the regulation of gene expression [1-3]. Ubiquitin ligases (E3s), a numerous and highly
diverse group of enzymes able to transfer ubiquitin to
target proteins, are fundamental components of the ubiquitination system [3]. E3 enzymes can be classified into
a few groups, depending on whether they are single proteins or multiprotein complexes and on structural features of the proteins involved. One of the most
characteristic types of E3s is the proteins of the HECT

Científicas (IBV-CSIC), Valencia, Spain

family. HECT E3s are enzymes that have a C-terminal
HECT domain, involved in both accepting ubiquitin
from a ubiquitin-conjugating protein and catalyzing its
transfer to the protein to be ubiquitinated [4]. Exceptionally, one HECT enzyme, HERC5, has been shown to be
involved in attaching the ubiquitin-like protein ISG15,
instead of ubiquitin, to its substrates [5,6]. Because they
are involved in the regulation of several basic cellular
mechanisms (signal transduction pathways, protein trafficking, DNA damage, etc), HECT proteins have attracted
a considerable attention and interest in them is growing
since they have been found to be involved in several
human diseases (reviewed in [4,7-9]). Of particular interest is that multiple HECT E3s have been associated to a
broad variety of types of cancer [7,8,10].
HECT family proteins have been divided into three
classes: 1) Those containing tryptophan-tryptophan

(WW) domains, called NEDD4-like E3s; 2) Those containing RCC1-like domains, known as HERCs; and, 3)
those lacking any of those domains (Single-HECT E3s)
[4,7,8]. However, whether this simple classification
makes sense from an evolutionary point of view has not
been hitherto investigated. Currently, the evolutionary
history of HECT ubiquitin ligases is unknown. Consequently, there are many basic questions that remain
unanswered. For instance, we cannot establish when
HECT E3s acquired their current roles or whether
HECT E3s that perform similar functions are evolutionary closely related or not. This situation not only implies
a general lack of understanding of this group of proteins
but also generates practical problems, such as to make
difficult to determine the model organisms that may be
used to improve our understanding of the functions of
the HECT E3s involved in human pathologies. In this
work, I performed a comprehensive set of analyses to
determine the relationships among HECT E3s, obtaining
significant advances in our understanding of their evolution and also novel hints about how they acquired their
current functions.

Methods
A first step in this study was the generation of a comprehensive database of HECT proteins. To obtain that database, I performed TBLASTN and BLASTP searches,
using multiple HECT domain sequences as queries,
against the nr, htgs, gss, est and wgs databases of the
National Center for Biotechnology Information http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/. After eliminating duplicates,
sequences with identity ≥ 99% and partial sequences (size
< 300 amino acids), a final database of 1081 protein
sequences was obtained. From it, I selected 594 derived
from metazoan genomes or from the choanoflagellate
Monosiga brevicollis. This species is a good outgroup to
establish which genes were already present when animals
emerged, given that choanoflagellates are the closest
extant relatives of animals [11]. The 594 sequences were
then aligned using Clustal X 2.07 [12] and the alignment
was manually edited with GeneDoc 2.7 [13] to correct for
minor mistakes. For phylogenetic analyses, dendrograms
were obtained using three different methods of tree
reconstruction (neighbor-joining [NJ], maximum parsimony [MP] and maximum likelihood [ML]). The methods used to obtain these dendrograms were essentially
the same described in [14]. The only two minor improvements on that paper were that the number of tied trees
saved in the MP procedure was here 100, instead of 20,
and that 200 bootstrap replicates (and not just 100) were
performed in the ML analyses.
The searches performed to generate this database
were not exhaustive. With the methods that I used,
some members of the HECT family (e. g. those partially

Page 2 of 12

sequenced) could have passed undetected. Thus, in
order to obtain a more precise picture of the patterns of
appearance and loss of HECT E3s, I performed a second, more focused, set of searches to detect all the
HECT proteins present in 14 model species with fully
or almost fully sequenced genome. These species were
the choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis, the placozoan
Trichoplax adhaerens, the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis, six insects (two dipterans, Drosophila melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae, two hymenopterans, Apis
mellifera and Nasonia vitripennis, the beetle Tribolium
castaneum and the hemipteran Acyrthosiphon pisum),
two nematodes such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Brugia malayi, the echinoderm Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, the urochordate Ciona intestinalis, and, finally, our
own species, the vertebrate Homo sapiens. Moreover, I
also searched for all HECT proteins and protein fragments present in a wide set of lophotrochozoan species
(i. e. invertebrates such as molluscs, platyhelminthes,
annelids, etc), for which the set of HECT E3s is still
quite incomplete.
Within a protein family, subfamilies can be defined as
sets of proteins present in multiple species that are both
evolutionary closely related – as indicated by sequencebased analyses – and share structural features, such as
the presence of subfamily-specific protein domains. In
previous works, we successfully used a classification into
subfamilies to analyze the long-term evolution of
another family of E3s, named RBR [14-17]. Here, I used
similar methods. In order to establish subfamilies within
the HECT family, I combined the results of phylogenetic
and structural analyses. Thus, on one hand, branches
used to establish the proteins that belong to a subfamily
must be significantly supported by bootstrap analyses.
On the other hand, proteins in those branches must be
structurally very similar or identical. Structural analyses
were performed with InterProScan [18]. All the HECT
proteins in humans, the placozoan Trichoplax adhaerens, the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis and the choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis were analyzed. The
proteins of the three model animal species were identical unless otherwise indicated.
Finally, the functional data regarding the substrates of
HECT E3s were obtained from the current literature
(up to the end of September 2009) by searching the
PubMed database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/
entrez?db=PubMed, using the names and synonyms
described in the NCBI Entrez Gene database http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=gene for each
mammalian HECT gene. TBLASTN analyses were used
to determine whether the substrates of particular HECT
E3s in mammals had orthologs in Monosiga or Trichoplax species. For these analyses, human proteins were
used as query sequences.

Results
A natural classification of the HECT family

The three methods of phylogenetic reconstruction
yielded very similar results and it was possible to subdivide the HECT family in groups highly supported by
bootstrap analyses. Figure 1 shows a summary of the
trees obtained (see details in Additional files 1 and 2).
As shown in that figure, 99.5% (591/594) of the proteins
were ascribed to 16 “natural” groups, which were fully
confirmed using structural data: Each group contained
proteins with identical or nearly identical structures
(Figure 2). Variations were only detected in a few
NEDD4-like proteins (e. g. lack of the C2 domain; lack
of one of the WW domains). Following the conventions
used to classify the RBR family of ubiquitin ligases
[14-17], I have called these groups as subfamilies. Therefore, each subfamily is an evolutionary independent unit
and the members of a particular subfamily have both
similar sequences and a characteristic protein structure.
As detailed in the Material and methods section, given
that the searches performed were not exhaustive, there
was the possibility of additional subfamilies being
missed. However, although searches in multiple model
species (see details in Material and methods) indeed
unearthed some additional sequences, no new subfamilies were detected. Table 1 summarizes the details of the
genes included in each subfamily
The classification obtained totally contradicts the currently accepted division of HECT E3s into three groups.
There are two main incongruences. First, HERC E3s,
one of the accepted classes of HECT ubiquitin ligases,
are in fact divided into two subfamilies that are distantly
related (Small HERCs, Large HERCs). This result agrees
well with the fact that the RCC1-like domains in Small
and Large HERCs are very different [19]. Actually, the
distant relationship observed when analyzing their
HECT domains indicates that the RCC1-like domains of
these proteins have been acquired twice independently.
Second, the postulated “Single HECT” group is meaningless from an evolutionary point of view. The proteins
of that group can be naturally divided into 13 subfamilies, which are moreover interspersed in the trees with
HERCs and NEDD4-like E3s. Therefore, the only group
in the current classification of HECT E3s that is evolutionary supported is that of NEDD4-like E3s (NEDD4
subfamily; Figure 1). According to the results obtained,
the NEDD4 subfamily is a monophyletic group which
contained four members when animals emerged. Most
animal groups have retained those 4 ancestral genes
(that I have called NEDD4a - NEDD4d) while a substantial increase occurred in vertebrates, which have 9
NEDD4 subfamily genes (see details in Table 1). This
increase was most likely associated to the genomic

Page 3 of 12

duplications that occurred in the vertebrate lineage. A
caveat for the conclusion that the NEDD4 subfamily is
monophyletic is that, given that the trees summarized in
Figure 1 are unrooted, it is a formal possibility that the
root was to be found within the NEDD4 group. This
option seems however unlikely, given the high similarity
in sequence and structure of all the proteins of this subfamily. A final important conclusion is that some subfamilies are significantly related. High bootstrap support
for some inner branches of the trees, which include several subfamilies (e. g. HACE1-HUWE1; UBE3AHECTX-HECTD2-Small HERCs; TRIP12-HECTD1;
KIAA0614-HECTD3-Large HERCs), can be observed in
Figure 1.
These conclusions imply a novel paradigm of how distinct HECT E3s relate to each other and therefore have
significant functional implications, as a simple example
may indicate: on one hand, these results mean that caution is required to compare functional data for Small
HERC and Large HERC subfamily proteins, given that
their similarity is due to convergence. On the other
hand, they also unsuspectedly suggest that data from
HECTD3 subfamily proteins may provide clues of how
the Large HERC subfamily proteins function, given their
close evolutionary relationships (Figure 2). In fact,
HECTD3 and the Large HERC protein HERC1 are the
only HECT E3s that contain DOC domains [20], indicating an ancient functional similarity.
Patterns of emergence and loss of HECT ubiquitin ligases
in animals

Considering all the data obtained together, it was possible to formulate the most parsimonious hypothesis for
the diversification of HECT E3s in animals, which is
summarized in Figure 3. This hypothesis is based on
minimizing the number of evolutionary events that must
have occurred to explain the current patterns of presence/absence of HECT-encoding genes. Three main
conclusions can be drawn from Figure 3. First, it turns
out that almost all HECT subfamilies, and in general
the great majority of HECT-encoding genes currently
detected in all species, originated either before the choanoflagellata/metazoa split or just after that split. In fact,
the number of subfamilies that existed before the origin
of metazoans may be underestimated by these analyses,
given that it is possible that the lineage that gave rise to
the single choanoflagellate analyzed lost some HECT
genes. In any case, we can safely conclude that the first
animals had a diversity of HECT E3s (19 genes from 14
subfamilies) that was quite similar to that found now in
living animals. This is made especially clear when the
number and variety of HECT E3s in a few key organisms is detailed (Table 1). The second conclusion is that

Figure 2 Structures of typical members of the subfamilies. To obtain this figure, all the HECT proteins present in humans, the placozoan
Trichoplax adhaerens, the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis and the choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis were structurally analyzed using
InterProScan [18]. The structures from orthologous proteins in the three animals were generally identical, and therefore all but four of the
proteins shown here are from humans. The four exceptions derive from Monosiga brevicollis. Three of them are detailed in the figure. The fourth
belongs to the HECTX subfamily, which is not present in vertebrates. Minimal variations were detected in some NEDD4 subfamily proteins (e. g.
lack of the C2 domain; lack of one of the WW domains). Also, this figure shows the structure of just one of the Large HERC proteins, HERC1, but
does not depict the structure of HERC2 (described before by e. g. [31]).

there has been a reduction in the number of HECT E3s
in particular metazoan lineages, such as nematodes,
insects and urochordates. Their sets of HECT E3s are in
some cases (see e. g. Caenorhabditis elegans data) much
simpler than the one that can be deduced for the ancestor of all animals (Table 1, Figure 3). Finally, the third
conclusion is that the number of HECT proteins largely
increased in the vertebrate lineage. The known genomic
duplications in that lineage may explain this pattern.
However, that increase is concentrated on just two subfamilies (NEDD4 and Small HERCs; Figure 3), indicating
that many other duplicates have been lost. In the
NEDD4 subfamily, finding only 2-3 genes of each
orthology group (NEDD4a-NEDD4d), instead of 4,
implies that some losses have also occurred.
Correlations between diversification and function of HECT
proteins

Elucidating the evolution of the HECT family of E3s
may allow for a more precise understanding of how the

current functions of these proteins emerged. Although
the functional information for animal HECT E3s is largely restricted to mammalian proteins, it is still possible
to obtain some ideas of how several functions originated
by comparing the patterns of presence/absence of genes
encoding HECT proteins and genes encoding their substrates. More precisely, the question that can be tackled
is when HECT E3s started to ubiquitinate the substrates
that we observe today. Of particular interest are three
basic systems present in all animals that are known to
be regulated by HECT E3s. The first of them is the
transforming growth factor b (TGF-b) signaling pathway, one of the main signal transduction systems in animals, involved in multiple cellular and developmental
processes [21]. The TGF-b pathway is precisely regulated by ubiquitination [22,23]. Particularly, it is well
established that several members of the NEDD4 subfamily of HECT E3s control, directly or indirectly, TGF-b
signaling [4,22,23]. Figure 4 summarizes the known substrates of NEDD4 E3s that are known to be related to

When several genes of the same family are present in humans, the names are indicated. Otherwise, the single human gene has the same name as the
corresponding subfamily. Monosiga contains four genes that cannot be assigned to any subfamily (asterisk). Three of them are detailed in Figure 2. For the fourth
(Accession number XM_001748120) only a partial HECT domain was obtained, precluding their inclusion in the phylogenetic analyses.

the TGF-b signaling pathway. They include from one of
the units of the TGF-b receptor (Tbr1) and multiple critical mediators of the pathway (e. g. several Smads) to
downstream targets of this signaling system, such as
transcription factors that are regulated by TGF-b signaling (e. g. RUNX2, RUNX3) or the protein phosphatase
PTEN, a well-known tumor suppressor (see further
details in the legend of Figure 4). Figure 4 also includes
whether these TGF-b-related proteins are detected in
choanoflagellates (Monosiga) or in placozoans (Trichoplax). This allows comparing the origin of the NEDD4
subfamily genes with the origin of their substrates. The
picture that emerges is very complex. On one hand, and
as it could be expected, some proteins that appeared
recently, from vertebrate-specific duplications, have
often the same substrates (e. g. the proteins encoded by
Smurf1 and Smurf2, originated from a duplication of the
ancestral NEDD4c gene; Figures 3, 4). However, on the
other hand, and surprisingly, proteins encoded by genes
that emerged from duplications that occurred before

animals originated also often share substrates. For example, the proteins encoded by NEDD4L, WWP1 and the
Smurf genes, which respectively derive from the
NEDD4a, NEDD4b and NEDD4c ancestral genes, have
multiple common substrates (Figure 4). This similarity
is even more surprising, considering that the four ancestral NEDD4 genes (NEDD4a - NEDD4d) originated
before the emergence of the TGFb signaling pathway,
which is absent in choanoflagellates ([11]; see also Figure 4). Therefore, it can be deduced that several HECT
E3s have - independently and long after they arose –
acquired the ability to modify the same substrates.
Interestingly, a similar situation is found when several
proteins involved in the endocytosis of epidermal
growth factor receptors (EGFRs) are considered. Both
one of the proteins of the EGFR family (ErbB4) and several mediators and regulators of the endocytosis of
EGFRs are ubiquitinated by NEDD4 subfamily proteins
(Figure 5; [10]). It turns out that all the proteins related
to EGFR metabolism are ubiquitinated by 2 - 4 NEDD4

emergence of new genes (indicated in the boxes) and rectangles, a gene loss. Question marks indicate cases in which it is unclear that a gene
is present or not, due to partial data. The names NEDD4a-d refer to the four ancestral genes of the NEDD4 subfamily that still exist in many
animals (Table 1) and that emerged before the metazoa/choanoflagellata split. In humans, the genes NEDD4 and NEDD4L derive from a
duplication of NEDD4a, WWP1, WWP2 and ITCH derive from NEDD4b, Smurf1 and Smurf2 from NEDD4c and NEDL1 and NEDL2 from NEDD4d. The
partial data available for lophotrochozoans (in brackets) allows concluding that all genes are present in at least one species of this group of
organisms, and therefore they were all present in their common ancestor. However, losses in particular lineages may have occurred.

E3s ([4,10]; Figure 6). In this case, not only NEDD4
subfamily proteins but also HUWE1 are known to ubiquitinate p53 or p53-related proteins. Moreover,
UBE3A/E6-AP (member a third subfamily) has been
found also to ubiquitinate p53, albeit only when

complexed with the papillomavirus protein E6 [24]. It is
obvious that all these proteins originated well before the
diversification of the p53 family: although a p53-related
protein is already present in choanoflagellates, the three
members that we found in vertebrates (p53, p63 and
p73) emerged by duplication of the single gene present
before the cephalochordate/vertebrate split [25]. Again,
independent cooptions of the same substrates by very
different HECT E3s have occurred.

corresponding substrates. The presence (+) or absence (-) of genes encoding those substrates in the choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis (M. b.)
and the placozoan Trichoplax adhaerens (T. a.) is also indicated. NEDD4a - NEDD4d refer to the four genes already present in early animals. A
question mark indicates that one or more related genes are detected, but it is unclear whether they are true orthologs of the corresponding
human genes. It is clear from this data that NEDD4 genes of different origin ubiquitinate now the same substrates.

Discussion and Conclusions
This study is focused on the characterization of the origin and evolutionary history of HECT ubiquitin ligases.
The combination of sequence and structural analyses
(Figures 1 and 2) allows establishing a natural classification of these proteins. This classification turns to be
totally different from the one hitherto assumed. The
division in sixteen subfamilies - groups of proteins that
have very similar sequences and structures – is much

more precise than the classification into three groups
proposed before [4,7,8]. Moreover, I have found that at
least two of the three groups defined in previous studies
are not monophyletic, and therefore, not being real evolutionary units, should not be used for classification purposes. Therefore, this work provides a new evolutionary
paradigm for the HECT family.
Twelve of the sixteen subfamilies generally group single orthologous genes in all animal species in which

they are present, while the other four (NEDD4, UBE3B/
3C, Large HERCs and Small HERCs) include several (up
to nine genes for the NEDD4 subfamily in vertebrates).
However, the results obtained also hint to broader classification patterns that put together members of different subfamilies (as indicated above: HACE1-HUWE1;
UBE3A-HECTX-HECTD2-Small HERCs; TRIP12HECTD1; KIAA0614-HECTD3-Large HERCs). Many of
the genes and proteins of these subfamilies have been so
far barely explored. Thus, to known of these cryptic
relationships may be useful to design experiments based
on what is understood for members of closely related
subfamilies.
The precise analysis of the patterns of presence/
absence in multiple model organisms allowed establishing the most parsimonious hypothesis for the evolution
of HECT genes in animals (Figure 3). Notably, most
HECT subfamilies arose before the emergence of animals or very early in metazoan evolution. The number
of novel subfamilies emerged later is very low, just two

of them (G2E3 and HACE1) appeared after the chordate/echinoderm split (Figure 3). I conclude that, since
the origin of animals, HECT genes have generally been
either maintained or, in some lineages such as insects,
nematodes and urochordates, lost. Only vertebrates have
a number of HECT genes much higher than the one
that can be deduced for early animals, due to specific
duplications of both the NEDD4 and the small HERC
subfamily genes (Table 1; Figure 3). It is striking that all
these patterns of diversification and streamlining are virtually identical, lineage by lineage, to the ones that I
recently described for RBR ubiquitin ligases [14]. This
suggests the presence of underlying selective forces acting on the evolution of the animal ubiquitination system
as a whole, sometimes leading to its simplification by
the progressive loss of E3s. The deep reasons that
explain the parallelism observed for RBR and HECT
ubiquitin ligases are a mystery. To discover what controls the patterns of duplication, conservation and loss
of E3 proteins is another promising line of research.

details.

The comparison of the emergence of the HECT genes
and the genes that encode known substrates of HECT
proteins (Figures 4, 5 and 6) follows a complex pattern
that cannot be simply explained by the typical “textbook” processes that we know often follow after gene
duplications, such as neofunctionalization leading to the
acquisition of new functions by one of the duplicates or
subfunctionalization that divides the functions of the
original gene between its duplicates. This is especially
obvious for the members of the TGF-b signaling pathway regulated by NEDD4 subfamily HECTs (Figure 4). I
have found that there were four NEDD4 genes before

animals emerged (Figure 3). It is also well established
that the TGF-b system is not present in choanoflagellates ([11] and analyses presented above). Therefore, the
simplest expectation would be that, in early animal history, a single NEDD4 protein was co-opted to regulate
the novel signaling system. However, the current mammalian data shows that multiple, distantly related
NEDD4 subfamily proteins are involved in the regulation of many (and often the same) proteins of the TGFb
pathway. This must be interpreted as evidence for multiple independent cooptions of HECT proteins to perform similar roles in the TGF-b pathway. The caveat

Marín BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:56
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/56

that many of these results have been obtained in vitro or
by overexpressing the E3s in cell culture assays, and
often through directed searches devised to test multiple
related NEDD4 proteins (e. g. [26]), must be acknowledged. It is therefore possible that not all the interactions described so far actually occur in whole organisms,
However, if the pattern shown in Figure 4 is basically
correct (and the patterns shown in Figures 5 and 6 for
other systems indeed have similar features), then it is a
strong indication that enzymes that are part of complex
families, with many members, may act on functionally
related substrates in ways that do not follow any simple
pattern and therefore may be largely unpredictable. This
type of results indicates that there may be significant
shortcomings in our current models of how duplicated
genes differentiate, evolve new functions and are preserved in the genomes (see discussion in [27]). Often,
simplistic expectations are not fulfilled and what is really
happening can only be understood by the combination
of detailed phylogenetic analyses and functional data, as
it has been shown here and also, recently, in other
related studies (e. g. [28-30]).
At present, data for substrates of HECT proteins have
largely restricted to members of the NEDD4 family. Out
of 131 substrates that I have found in the literature, 92
were described for NEDD4 proteins (Additional file 3).
Therefore, it is still impossible to have a well-defined
picture of all the different roles of the HECT E3s as a
whole. However, the available results clearly point to a
general involvement in the control of many key pathways that impinge on the regulation of gene expression
[4]. This is obvious from the data that I have shown in
Figures 4, 5 and 6, and it is reinforced by the large set
of additional results showing that HECT E3s also regulate proteins that are either part of other signal transduction pathways (e. g. Notch, TrkA, Insulin-like
growth factor, interleukin receptors, etc.) or directly
involved in gene expression and its regulation (RNA pol
II, histones, TopBP1, c-Jun, etc.). These results may contribute to explain one of the main features associated to
this family, the fact that many of its members have been
found in different ways to be associated to multiple
types of cancer [7,8,10]. Results shown here demonstrate
that these members are not necessarily closely related,
but often belong to different subfamilies. Further experimental results may contribute to clarify whether there is
some subfamily specificity, in which members of different subfamilies have clearly distinct roles and primarily
affect different cell types, or whether the roles of distant
members of the HECT family may be indeed substantially overlapping, as the data currently available suggest.
In this direction of future research, the discovery of
some model species in which the number of HECT E3s
has been largely reduced (e. g. Caenorhabditis elegans,

Page 11 of 12

in which there are only 9 HECT genes; Table 1) may be
especially interesting, given that it may help to sort out
more easily the roles of particular HECT ubiquitin
ligases.
