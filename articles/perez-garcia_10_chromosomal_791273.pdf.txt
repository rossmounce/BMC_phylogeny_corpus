histone genes and telomeric sequences in
Brachidontes puniceus and Brachidontes rodriguezi
(Bivalvia, Mytilidae)

Abstract
Background: Chromosome rearrangements are an important part of the speciation process in many taxa. The
study of chromosome evolution in bivalves is hampered by the absence of clear chromosomal banding patterns
and the similarity in both chromosome size and morphology. For this reason, obtaining good chromosome
markers is essential for reliable karyotypic comparisons. To begin this task, the chromosomes of the mussels
Brachidontes puniceus and B. rodriguezi were studied by means of fluorochrome staining and fluorescent in situ
hybridization (FISH).
Results: Brachidontes puniceus and B. rodriguezi both have 2n = 32 chromosomes but differing karyotype
composition. Vertebrate-type telomeric sequences appear at both ends of every single chromosome. B. puniceus
presents a single terminal major rRNA gene cluster on a chromosome pair while B. rodriguezi shows two. Both
mussels present two 5S rDNA and two core histone gene clusters intercalary located on the long arms of two
chromosome pairs. Double and triple-FISH experiments demonstrated that one of the 5S rDNA and one of the
major rDNA clusters appear on the same chromosome pair in B. rodriguezi but not in B. puniceus. On the other
hand, the second 5S rDNA cluster is located in one of the chromosome pairs also bearing one of the core histone
gene clusters in the two mussel species.
Conclusion: Knowledge of the chromosomal distribution of these sequences in the two species of Brachidontes is
a first step in the understanding of the role of chromosome changes on bivalve evolution.

Background
Over recent years, an increasing number of molecular
studies have focused on the elucidation of the phylogenetic relationships among species of bivalves in order to
further reveal their evolutionary history [1]. Nevertheless, cytogenetic comparisons between species remain
quite rare mainly due to difficulties in obtaining good
chromosome banding patterns [2]. This fact, together
with the small differences in chromosome size and morphology in many species of bivalves, makes the unequivocal identification of each chromosome pair very
difficult and therefore, complicates cytogenetic
comparisons.

Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) allows combining cytogenetic and molecular techniques, improving
our understanding of genome organization. The chromosomal mapping of different types of DNA sequences
in bivalves has greatly increased over the last years
[2-4]. Although the information gained so far is of great
importance in the analysis of chromosome evolution in
bivalves, the data obtained are still scarce and focused
on a limited number of DNA sequences, mainly in species with commercial interest.
Most FISH reports in bivalves have been concentrated
on the chromosomal localization of major rRNA genes
rather than on other gene families such as 5S rDNAs
and histone genes [2,5]. Major rDNA has been located
in about 50 species of bivalves [2,5], including seven
species of the family Mytilidae [5-11]. 5S rDNA has

been located in a small number of species belonging to
the families Cardiidae [12], Mytilidae [5,11], Ostreidae
[13,14] and Pectinidae [15-20]. The organization of the
histone genes has been characterized in two species of
mussels [21-24], one scallop [25] and three species of
venerid clams [26] but their chromosomal locations are
only known in two species of mussels [5,22,24] and four
species of Pectinidae [27]. Telomeric sequences have
been characterized and located in a few species of
bivalves, including two species of Mytilidae [5,6,28].
Brachidontes (senegalensis) puniceus (Gmelin 1791) is
a small mussel species native to the African Atlantic
coast, from Mauritania to Angola. B. rodriguezi (d’Orgbigny 1846) is a medium-sized mussel distributed from
Río Grande do Sul (Brazil) to the northern part of Patagonia (Argentina) on the Atlantic coast of South America. Karyological data on the genus Brachidontes is
limited to the knowledge of the karyotypes and the
chromosomal location of the major rDNA in B. rodriguezi [8] and B. pharaonis [10]. In order to expand the
cytogenetic information on the family Mytilidae, we analyzed the chromosomes of B. puniceus and B. rodriguezi
by means of 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)/propidium iodide (PI) and chromomycin A3 (CMA)/DAPI
fluorescence staining and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with 28S rDNA, 5S rDNA, core histone
genes and telomeric probes.

Methods
Animals

Samples of Brachidontes puniceus were collected at São
Vicente (Cape Verde) and São Tomé (São Tomé and
Principe). B. rodriguezi specimens were collected at Mar
del Plata (Argentina). Mussels were maintained in the
laboratory in tanks of 5 L of aerated, filtered seawater at
18 ± 1°C and fed on a mixture of microalgae cells (Isochrysis galbana and Tetraselmis suecica) for at least 15
days in order to promote both somatic growth and
gonadic maturation.
Chromosome preparation and fluorochrome staining

Chromosome preparations were obtained following the
technique described previously [6]. Juvenile specimens
were housed in 0.5 L beakers and exposed to colchicine
(0.005%) for 12 h. Gill and mantle tissues were excised
and immersed in 50% and 25% seawater for 90 min and
fixed with ethanol/acetic acid for 1 h. Chromosome
spreads were obtained by dissociating small pieces of tissue in 60% acetic acid, pipetting suspension drops onto
slides heated to 55°C and air-drying.
Some chromosome preparations were stained for 2 h
with CMA (0.25 mg mL -1 ) and counterstained with
DAPI (0.14 μg mL-1) for 8 min. Once washed with distilled water, slides were air-dried and mounted with

Page 2 of 9

antifade (Vectashield, Vector). After visualization and
photography, preparations were washed and re-stained
with a combination of DAPI (0.14 μg mL-1) and PI (0.07
μg mL -1 ). The slides were then washed in distilled
water, air-dried, mounted in antifade and photographed
again.
Chromosome counts and karyotype analysis were performed in 10 specimens (5 males, 5 females) of each
species. In order to determine the karyotype of Brachidontes puniceus, ten good metaphase plates were used
to construct karyotypes. Chromosome and arm lengths
were carefully measured and relative lengths and centromeric indices were calculated. Chromosome nomenclature follows Levan et al. [29].
DNA extraction, PCR amplification and probe labeling

Total DNA was extracted following the method of
Estoup et al. [30] with minor modifications. About 3 mg
of adductor muscle tissue was homogenized in 0.4 mL
of a pre-warmed (60°C) 10% Chelex 100 (BioRad) solution. After adding pronase (1.4 mg mL-1) and incubating
for 1 h at 60°C in agitation, the extracted DNA was
stored at 4°C.
FISH probes were obtained by PCR. Amplifications
were performed in 20 μl of a solution containing 50 ng
DNA, 1× PCR buffer, 0.5 mM each dNTP, 2.5 mM
MgCl2, 1 μM each primer and 1 U BIOTAQ DNA polymerase (Bioline). The combinations of primers used in
the amplification appear in Table 1. Universal primers
(LR10R, LR12) were used to amplify a fragment of the
28S rRNA gene of the major rDNA repeat [31]. For the
5S rDNA amplification, primers were designed from the
sequence of the 5S rRNA of Mytilus edulis [32]. The
amplifications of the H2B/H2A and the H3 histone
genes were performed using primers designed from the
sequences of the histone genes of Mytilus edulis [23]
and those described by Giribet and Distel [1], respectively. After 5 min denaturation at 95°C, 30 cycles of
amplification were performed using the conditions that
are shown in Table 1. A final extension step of 7 min at
72°C was applied. All reactions were performed in a
GeneAmp PCR system 9700 (Applied Biosystem) and
PCR products were examined by electrophoresis on a
2% agarose gel. Single products were obtained after
amplification using each set of primers. 28S rDNA was
labeled with biotin 16-UTP and/or digoxigenin-UTP
(10× DIG Labeling Mix, Roche) by nick translation. 5S
rDNA and histone genes were directly labeled by PCR
either with biotin-16-UTP or digoxigenin-UTP. The
labeled PCR products were precipitated before FISH.
Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)

Single and double FISH experiments were performed
following the methods published previously [33] with

minor modifications. Preparations were denatured at 69°
C for 2 min and hybridized overnight at 37°C. Signal
detection was carried out with fluorescein avidin and
biotinylated anti-avidin for the biotinylated probes and
with mouse antidigoxigenin, goat anti-mouse rhodamine
and rabbit anti-goat rhodamine for the digoxigeninlabeled probes. Slides were counterstained with DAPI
and mounted in antifade.
In order to map three probes on the same metaphase
plates, two consecutive FISH were performed. In the
first one, a histone gene probe labeled with biotin and a
5S rDNA probe labeled with digoxigenin were
employed. After visualization and photography, the preparations were re-hybridized using a 28S rDNA probe
simultaneously labeled by nick translation with both
biotin and digoxigenin and the same metaphase plates
were visualized and photographed again. In addition, we
also performed FISH with a telomeric (CCCTAA)3 peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probe (Applied Biosystems) following the protocol indicated by the supplier.
Slide visualization and photography were performed
with a Nikon Eclipse-800 microscope equipped with an
epifluorescence system. Separated images for each fluorochrome were obtained with a Sensys CCD camera
(Photometrics) connected to the microscope. Camera
control and digital image acquisition employed a Power
Macintosh computer. Pseudocoloring and merging of
the images was performed with Adobe Photoshop.

Results
Coinciding with previously reported data [8], Brachidontes rodriguezi presents a diploid chromosome number of 2n = 32 (Figure 1i-p) and its karyotype is
composed of 2 metacentric, 12 subtelocentric and 2
telo/subtelocentric chromosome pairs (Figure 2j). B.
puniceus also shows a diploid complement of 2n = 32
chromosomes (Figure 1a-h). The karyotype is composed
of 1 metacentric, 3 submetacentric, 4 submeta/subtelocentric, 4 subtelocentric and 4 telocentric chromosome
pairs (Figure 2i). A summary of the results obtained
after measuring the DAPI-stained chromosomes of 10 of
the best complete metaphase plates is given in Table 2.

No differences were observed between the São Vicente
and São Tomé populations.
Telomeric sequences were detected using a vertebrate
telomeric (CCCTAA)3 PNA probe. Single distinct terminal signals appear at the ends of both sister chromatids
of every mitotic chromosome in the two species (Figure
1d, h, l, p). No additional interstitial telomeric sequences
were observed. Although the sizes of the telomeric signals do not show a high variability, consistently bigger
signals appear at terminal regions of the long arm of
one of the members of one chromosome pair in Brachidontes puniceus (Figure 1d) and of the short arms of
two chromosome pairs in B. rodriguezi (Figure 1l). One
of the B. puniceus mussels presents an additional bigger
telomeric signal (Figure 1h) and one of the B. rodriguezi
specimens shows only three bigger telomeric signals
(Figure 1p).
DAPI/PI staining of mitotic metaphase plates reveals
the presence of a DAPI negative (DAPI-) terminal region
on the long arm of the subtelocentric chromosome pair #
15 in Brachidontes puniceus (Figure 1a, e). One of the
mussels shows an additional DAPI- band on the short
arm of the chromosome pair also bearing the standard
band (Figure 1e). CMA staining of the same metaphase
plates (Figure 1b, f) shows that these regions are CMA
bright (CMA+). B. rodriguezi presents DAPI-/CMA+
regions on the short arms of the two telo/subtelocentric
chromosome pairs, # 4 and # 6 (Figure 1i, j, m, n), but
one of the individuals analyzed shows only three DAPI-/
CMA+ positive regions in every single cell (Figure 1m, n).
FISH signals for the major ribosomal genes were analyzed in 130 complete metaphase plates in five Brachidontes puniceus mussels and in 150 metaphases in five
specimens of B. rodriguezi. B. puniceus presents two
major rDNA signals on a terminal region of the long
arm of the subtelocentric chromosome pair # 15 (Figure
1c). These signals coincide with the DAPI-/CMA+
regions (Figure 1a, b). The mussel showing an additional
DAPI-/CMA+ region (Figure 1e, f) also presents a third
28S rDNA signal at the same position (Figure 1g). Most
B. rodriguezi mussels present four major ribosomal signals, coincident with the DAPI-/CMA+ regions, on the

Figure 1 Sequential DAPI/PI and CMA staining followed by FISH using 28S rDNA (28S) and telomeric (TEL) probes on Brachidontes
puniceus (BPU) and Brachidontes rodriguezi (BRO) chromosomes. Sequential staining of the same metaphase plates with DAPI/PI (a, e) and
CMA (b, f) shows the presence of two GC-rich (DAPI dull/CMA bright) regions located at the ends of the long arms on one chromosome pair in
B. puniceus (arrows in a, b, e, f). One of the B. puniceus specimens shows an additional GC-rich region on the short arm of one of the members
of the chromosome pair bearing the standard band (arrowhead in e, f). In B. rodriguezi four GC-rich regions appear on the short arms of two
chromosome pairs (arrows in i, j) but one of the mussels shows only three of these bands (arrows in m, n) lacking the fourth (arrowhead in m,
n). FISH using a 28S rDNA probe (digoxigenin, rhodamine, red) gives signals at the CMA+ positions in both B. puniceus (arrows in c, g,
arrowhead in g) and B. rodriguezi (arrows in k, o). Note the absence of the fourth major rDNA signal in o (arrowhead). FISH using a PNAtelomeric probe (fluorescein, green) gives signals at both ends of every sister chromatid. Telomeric signals situated on the GC-rich NORs are
consistently bigger than the rest of the telomeric signals and their sizes are similar to the sizes of the 28S signals (arrows in d, h, l, p). Scale
bars, 5 μm.

Figure 2 Chromosomal location of 5S rDNA, major rDNA and core histone genes on Brachidontes puniceus and Brachidontes
rodriguezi. FISH using a 5S rDNA probe (digoxigenin, rhodamine, red) reveals the presence of two clusters of 5S rDNA on two chromosome
pairs in both B. puniceus (BPU, a) and B. rodriguezi (BRO, b). Double-FISH experiments using a 5S rDNA probe (digoxigenin, rhodamine, red) and
a 28S rDNA probe (biotin, fluorescein, green) show that major and minor gene clusters in B. puniceus (c) are to be found on different
chromosome pairs but that in B. rodriguezi (d) one of the chromosome pairs bearing a 5S rDNA signal also bears one of the major rDNA signals.
FISH using a histone H3 gene probe (biotin, fluorescein, green) shows two clusters of core histone genes on the long arms of two chromosome
pairs in both B. puniceus (e) and B. rodriguezi (f). Triple hybridization (g, h) using a digoxigenin labeled 5S rDNA probe (red), a biotin labeled
histone H3 gene probe (red) and a double (biotin and digoxigenin) labeled 28S rDNA probe (yellow, as a result of the mixture of green and red)
reveals that the histone gene clusters are independent of the major rDNA clusters in B. puniceus (g, i) and in B. rodriguezi (h, j). In both species,
one of the chromosome pairs bearing a 5S rDNA signal also carries one of the core histone gene signals (g, h, i, j). The metaphase plate in g, i
was also re-hybridized using a PNA telomeric probe (fluorescein, green). Scale bars, 5 μm.

short arms of the telo/subtelocentric chromosome pairs
# 4 and # 6 (Figure 1i, j, k), but the one showing only
three DAPI-/CMA+ regions (Figure 1m, n) also presents
only three major rDNA signals (Figure 1o). The consistently bigger telomeric signals appear at the DAPI-/
CMA+ NORs.
FISH signals corresponding to the minor ribosomal
genes were studied in 111 metaphases in B. puniceus
and 150 in B. rodriguezi. As shown in Figure 2a, 5S
rDNA signals are interstitially located on the long arms
of chromosome pairs # 4 and # 6 in B. puniceus. In B.
rodriguezi 5S rDNA signals are also intercalary located
on the long arms of two chromosome pairs, # 3 and # 4
(Figure 2b). The number of minor rDNA signals was
always 4 in B. puniceus but 2 or 4 in different metaphase plates in B. rodriguezi. Double-color FISH experiments (Figure 2c, d) confirmed the presence of major
and minor rDNA clusters on chromosome pair # 4 in B.
rodriguezi and therefore allowed the study of the distribution of the variable number of 5S rDNA signals
(Table 3). A 66.67% of the metaphase plates showed signals only on the NOR-bearing chromosome pair # 4.
The remaining metaphases showed 4 signals on pairs #
3 and # 4 (32%), being always weaker those in chromosome # 3 (Figure 2b, d, h, j), or only 2 signals on pair #
3 (1.33%).
Core histone genes were mapped by FISH using both
histone H3 and histone H2B/H2A probes. FISH signals
were analyzed in at least 20 complete metaphases per
mussel in 5 individuals in each species. Core histone

gene signals are interstitial to the long arms of chromosome pairs # 6 and # 10 in B. puniceus (Figure 2e). The
signal in pair # 10 is closer to the centromere. B. rodriguezi also shows intercalary signals on two chromosome
pairs, # 3 and # 9 (Figure 2f). In this species the signal
on chromosome pair # 9 is closer to the centromere.
Double-color FISH experiments using H3 and H2B/
H2A histone gene probes labeled differently always
showed coincident signals (not shown). In order to confirm the location of the histone gene clusters in relation
to the minor and major rDNA clusters, double and triple-color FISH experiments were performed. One of the
core histone gene clusters and one of the 5S rDNA clusters are on the same chromosome pair (Figure 2g, h)
both in B. puniceus (pair # 6) and B. rodriguezi (# 3).
The relative positions of the major rDNA, 5S rDNA and
histone gene clusters are indicated on the karyotypes
that appear on Figure 2i, j.

Discussion
The chromosomal characterization of the mussels of the
family Mytilidae includes the knowledge of mitotic chromosome numbers and karyotypes in 32 species. Six of
these species show the same diploid chromosome number (2n = 32) present in both Brachidontes puniceus and
B. rodriguezi [8]. On the contrary, the only other species
of this genus in which the karyotype has been described,
B. pharaonis, shows 2n = 28 chromosomes [10]. The
variability of chromosome numbers between species of
the same genus is widespread in the family Mytilidae;
with the exception of Mytilus, all genera of mussels in
which karyotypes have been determined for more than
one species show differences in chromosome numbers
[34]. On the other hand, the coincidence in chromosome numbers in B. puniceus and B. rodriguezi is
accompanied by considerable differences in karyotype
composition.
The detection of the vertebrate telomeric (TTAGGG)n
repeat at chromosome ends in Brachidontes puniceus

Pérez-García et al. BMC Genetics 2010, 11:109

and B. rodriguezi agrees with results obtained in chromosomes of other species of bivalves [2], including the
mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis [6,28] and Perumytilus
purpuratus [5]. On the contrary, the interstitial telomeric sequences clearly detected by FISH in P. purpuratus [5] and presumably appearing in M. galloprovincialis
[28] were not detected in these two species of Brachidontes. Although in bivalves telomeric sequences have
only been isolated and characterized in Donax trunculus
[28], the hybridization results obtained so far indicate
that the bivalve telomeres are composed of tandem
repeats of the hexanucleotide which also constitutes the
vertebrate telomeric sequence.
The presence of major rDNA signals on CMA bright
regions terminally located on a single chromosome pair
in Brachidontes puniceus and on two chromosome pairs
in B. rodriguezi is concordant with results obtained in
other bivalves. NORs have been located in around 50
species of bivalves [2,5] and are located at terminal positions on one to three chromosome pairs. In the family
Mytilidae, the position of major rRNA genes is known
in seven species. One NOR-bearing chromosome pair
has been detected in B. pharaonis [10], two in Mytilus
galloprovincialis [6], M. edulis [11], B. rodriguezi [8] and
Perumytilus purpuratus [5], and three in M. trossulus
and M. californianus [9]. The species of the genus Brachidontes show differences both in number and chromosomal location of the NORs. The single major ribosomal
gene cluster appears at a terminal position on the long
arm of one small subtelocentric chromosome pair in
both B. puniceus and B. pharaonis [10]. However, the
two major ribosomal gene clusters of B. rodriguezi are
spread over the whole short arms of the two subtelocentric/telocentric chromosomes pairs [8].
The occurrence of individuals showing a different
number of rDNA clusters to those usually found in the
species has been described in many taxa, including
humans [35]. In this sense, the presence of an additional
NOR in one of the B. puniceus specimens is not
remarkable and could be the result of a translocation
process as proposed for human ectopic NORs [35]. The
absence of one of the major rDNA clusters in one chromosome in B. rodriguezi can be attributed to unequal
crossover events [36].
The mostly coincident FISH signal sizes obtained at
the terminal NORs after using 28S rDNA and telomeric
probes in both B. rodriguezi and B. puniceus might indicate that some telomeric repeats are interspersed within
the major rDNA repeats; fiber-FISH and molecular analysis are necessary to confirm or discard this hypothesis.
Although not common, interspersion of telomeric and
major ribosomal DNA sequences has been observed in
bivalves, such as the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis [6]
and the scallop Patinopecten yessoensis [20], and in

other organisms such as fishes [37] and mammals [38].
The meaning of such organization is not well understood but a functional role in nucleolus organization for
tandem repeats has been proposed [39].
The chromosomal location of 5S rDNA clusters is
only known in 15 species of bivalves [2,5]. In most of
these species, minor rDNAs usually appear at interstitial
loci [18-20]. The presence of two 5S rDNA clusters in
both Brachidontes puniceus and B. rodriguezi differs
from the results obtained in Mytilus edulis and M. galloprovincialis [11], in which four 5S rDNA clusters appear
on three chromosome pairs, and Perumytilus purpuratus
[5], showing three 5S rDNA clusters on two chromosome pairs. Regarding the other species of bivalves in
which the location of these sequences is known, the
Ostreidae [13,14] and two species of Pectinidae [15,17]
also show two 5S rDNA clusters. On the contrary, Cerastoderma edule (Cardiidae) presents five clusters of 5S
rDNA on five different chromosome pairs [12] and
most species of Pectinidae show a single 5S rDNA cluster [16,18,20].
The variation in number of 5S rDNA FISH signals
detected in Brachidontes rodriguezi is mostly due to the
presence or absence of signals in chromosome pair # 3.
The small size of these signals probably indicates that
the number of 5S rDNA repeats at this locus is close to
the minimum necessary for the signal to be detected.
Similar variations in the number of 5S rDNA signals
have been detected in two other species of Mytilidae,
Mytilus galloprovincialis and M. edulis [11].
Our results demonstrate that major and minor rDNA
clusters are on different chromosome pairs in Brachidontes puniceus but that in B. rodriguezi one of the
NOR-bearing chromosome pairs also carries one of the
5S rDNA clusters. This is also the case in Perumytilus
purpuratus [5] and Chlamys farreri [16] but differs from
the presence of both major and 5S rDNA clusters on
different chromosome pairs in the rest of the bivalve
species studied so far.
Histone genes are usually organized as tandem repeats
in invertebrate genomes [40]. These clusters can be
composed by a copy of each one of the core histone
genes or both core and linker histone genes. Histone
gene arrangement in bivalves has been studied in the
mussels Mytilus edulis [21,23] and M. galloprovincialis
[22,24], and the scallop Chlamys farreri [25]. All of
them present clusters of core histone genes ordered in
the same way thus probably indicating a conserved
arrangement. Our results showing hybridization signals
at the same positions after FISH using H3 gene and
H2B/H2A gene probes point also to this situation in
Brachidontes puniceus and B. rodriguezi. Histone genes
are known to be located in two chromosome pairs in
the mussel M. galloprovincialis [24] and the scallop

Patinopecten yessoensis [27] but forming a single cluster
in other mussel species, Perumytilus purpuratus [5], and
in the scallops Argopecten irradians, Chlamys farreri
and C. nobilis [27]. Therefore, in the family Mytilidae,
the presence of two histone gene clusters in these two
Brachidontes species coincides with the situation in M.
galloprovincialis [24] but differs from the one in P. purpuratus [5].
One of the histone gene clusters and one of the 5S
rDNA clusters appear on the long arm of the same chromosome pair in both Brachidontes puniceus and B. rodriguezi. In addition, the relative positions of these clusters
with respect to the centromere are similar in both species
being the histone genes distal to the 5S rDNA. Although
these facts seem to indicate that this chromosome is conserved, further analyses are necessary in order to determine their homology. The only other species of bivalves
in which the position of these two sequences was investigated together is Perumytilus purpuratus [5]. In contrast
with B. puniceus and B. rodriguezi, in P. purpuratus the
single histone gene cluster and the 5S rDNA clusters are
located in different chromosome pairs.
The similarities in the chromosomal distribution of
major rDNA, 5S rDNA and core histone gene clusters
found in Brachidontes puniceus, B. rodriguezi and Perumytilus purpuratus [5] are not shared by Mytilus galloprovincialis [11,22,24] and confirm the closeness of P.
purpuratus to the species of Brachidontes, therefore
keeping open the possibility of its assignation to this
genus but discarding that P. purpuratus, B. rodriguezi
and B. darwinianus belongs to the same taxon [41].

Conclusions
The FISH results obtained in this work after using
major rDNA, 5S rDNA and histone gene probes allow
unequivocally identifying four of the 16 chromosome
pairs that compose the karyotypes of Brachidontes puniceus and B. rodriguezi. Additional research is in progress
in order to find more markers that allow chromosome
identification in Mytilidae and therefore to gain insights
on chromosome evolution in this family.
