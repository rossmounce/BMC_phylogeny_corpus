Background
Somatic embryogenesis is a useful method to propagate
conifers vegetatively. In many coniferous species
embryogenic cultures can be established from zygotic
embryos, while the embryogenic potential decreases during germination. Embryo formation is thought to require
a signal that induces a somatic cell to dedifferentiate
and gain embryogenic potential as well as the expression
of an appropriate cellular environment for the response
of the inductive signal. In Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) LEAFY COTYLEDON (LEC) genes are expressed
during the embryonic stage but must be repressed to
allow germination [1]. Treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) causes de-repression of LEC genes. In addition, ectopic post-embryonic
expression of LEC1 is sufficient to induce differentiation
of embryo-like structures from vegetative cells [2].
ABSCISIC ACID3 (ABI3) and its maize (Zea mays)
orthologue VIVIPAROUS1 (VP1) act together with the
LEC genes to promote embryo maturation [3]. Knowledge about the molecular mechanisms underlying
embryogenic competence in conifers is largely uncharacterized, although this is the foundation for propagation
of conifers through somatic embryos. However, we have
recently shown that TSA-treatment affects both the
embryogenic potential and the expression of embryogenesis-related genes in Norway spruce [4].

Materials and methods
Conifer sequences of LEC1-type HAP3 and ABI3/VP1
homologues were retrieved from public databases and
isolated in Norway spruce (Picea abies) and Scots Pine
(Pinus sylvestris). Phylogenetic analyses were done on
nucleotide alignments of conserved domains made using
Baysian inference (MrBayes) and maximum parsimony
(PAUP*). Embryogenic cell lines 06.28.05 of Norway
spruce and 12:12 of Scots pine were used in this study.
To analyze the effect of TSA (Sigma-Aldrich) during
maturation and germination of somatic embryos of Norway spruce, the growth media were supplemented with
10μM TSA. Expression levels of the conifer HAP3a and
VP1 genes were assessed using quantitative real-time
PCR.
Results and discussion
We isolated two conifer LEC1-type HAP3 genes,
HAP3A and HAP3B, from Norway spruce and Scots
pine. A comparative phylogenetic analysis of plant
HAP3 genes suggests that HAP3A and HAP3B are paralogous genes originating from a duplication event in the
conifer lineage. The angiosperm ABI3/VP1 genes belong
to the plant specific B3 gene family and phylogenetic
relationship position the conifer homologs closest to
ABI3 and VP1. The expression of HAP3A is high during
early embryo development but decreases during late
embryogeny, while the expression of VP1 is initially low
and increases during late embryogeny, in both Norway
spruce and Scots pine. The expression levels for both
genes are similar during somatic and zygotic embryogenesis. When embryogenic cultures of Norway spruce

were exposed to TSA during embryo maturation,
maturation was arrested and the expression levels of
PaHAP3A and PaVP1 were maintained. Furthermore,
when germinating somatic embryos of Norway spruce
were treated with TSA, the germination progression
was partially inhibited and the embryogenic potential
was maintained at a similar level as embryos before
germination.

Conclusions
Taken together, our results suggest that important regulators of embryogenesis are conserved between angiosperms and gymnosperms, and, assuming that TSA affects
histone acetylation in conifers, our results indicate a connection between between chromatin structure and
expression of embryogenesis-related genes in conifers.
