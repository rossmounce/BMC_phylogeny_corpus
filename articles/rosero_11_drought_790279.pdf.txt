Background
Gmelina (Gmelina arborea Roxb), also known as white
teak is a tropical deciduous tree native from moist tropical forests of Asia. It has been successfully introduced in
equatorial Africa, as well as central and south America.
Gmelina is known for its very fast growing rate, its
intrinsic disease, fire and drought tolerance, as well as
the quality of its wood which is suitable for different
types of uses such as paper pulping, plywood or particle
board industry, furniture and light constructions. In
addition, gmelina is considered a pioneer plant species
capable of rapidly colonizing eroded or low nutritional
quality lands, which makes it interesting for reforestation or landscape restoration programs. Despite its ecological and increasing economic importance, very little
is known about the biology of this species and its
remarkable field behavior such as drought tolerance, at
the genetic, molecular and biochemical levels.
Genomic tools have recently increased the numbers
and volume of genomic resources for several crop plants
and trees and have contributed to enlarge our knowledge on basic aspects of plant biology, population
dynamics or phylogeny; furthermore, they represent
valuable sources of candidate genes and new molecular
markers to assist breeding programs. Biological
sequences reported to date in public databases and
belonging to Gmelina do not exceed 20 entries: this
very narrow availability of genetic information is the
main bottleneck to initiate molecular breeding programs
in Gmelina arborea.

We report here the first genomic resource for this tropical tree based on an RNAseq transcriptome profiling
approach.

Methods
Two subtracted cDNA libraries were constructed from
both leaf and root tissue of gmelina seedlings submitted
to a water deficit stress. Subtracted cDNA sequencing
was completed using 454 GS FLX Titanium sequencing.
After sequence trimming, de novo assembly and clustering were completed using TGICL assembler and contigs
were functionally annotated using BlastX against high
quality curated protein reference databases. Both Gene
Ontology (GO) terms and KEGG metabolic pathways
assignments were used to further characterize transcripts. SSR motives were identified using MISA. Except
for the KEGG pathway assignments, all the sequence
analysis was compiled in the previously developed bioinformatic pipeline ESTTIK [http://esttik.cirad.fr/].
Results
A preliminary collection of 10.528 contigs and 10.661
singletons, enriched in drought related transcripts, was
obtained from both root and leaf subtracted libraries.
Contig sequence sizes ranged from 97 to 2.187 bp with
an average of 456 bp and a mean coverage depth of 38fold. Functional annotation was completed only for contigs: up to 65% of these assembled sequences had significant Blast hits and about half of all assembled contigs
could be assigned to one or more GO terms (Table 1).
Top hit species for homology based annotations of
gmelina unigenes were: Arabidopsis thaliana (20-27%),
Vitis vinifera (10-14%), Populus trichocarpa (4-7 %) and
Ricinus communis (4-7%). Among the different biological processes, cellular and metabolic processes,

biological regulation, localization and response to stimulus were the most highly represented GO term categories, involving several genes related to drought or
general stress, transport, transcription regulation and
signal transduction, as expected. Analysis of KEGG
metabolic pathway assignments revealed that our gene
catalog covers all major plant metabolic pathways, with
a certain dominance of enzymes of the carbohydrate,
amino acid and energy metabolism in leaves, indicative
that those pathways, seemingly impaired in response to
water deficit stress, tend to recover by means of an
active transcriptional rate (Table 2).
The metabolic response in roots was slightly different
with dominance of enzymes related to lipid, amino acid
and carbohydrate metabolism, supporting important
membrane and osmotic adjustment mechanisms in
these tissues. Importantly, our gene catalog comprises
many genes encoding proteins involved in signal perception and transduction, effector proteins as well as proteins with regulatory functions, allowing to cover the

Conclusions
In this survey, we present the first unigene resource of
this economically important tropical timber for which
almost no prior genetic information existed. We identified drought stress related genes in different functional
categories ranging from membrane bound sensor proteins, signal transduction proteins, transcription factors
to metabolic or effector proteins. The SSR motifs found
are good candidates for drought-related functional marker development in this species. Altogether, the results
represent a first contribution to a better knowledge of
the biology of white teak as well as the molecular
mechanisms underlying its drought tolerance, which
is essential to further encourage breeding program
developments.

whole molecular response to drought stress. On the
other hand the presence of several unigenes with no
blast hit or with homology to unknown hypothetical
proteins opens the possibility to uncover either previously unknown or less characterized protein functions
related to drought stress.
Finally, we also identified microsatellite motifs within
428 unigenes, from which, 255 primer pairs have been
designed for further experimental validation as functional SSR markers.
