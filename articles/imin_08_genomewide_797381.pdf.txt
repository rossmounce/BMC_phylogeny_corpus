Abstract
Background: The Medicago truncatula (M. truncatula) line 2HA has a 500-fold greater capacity to
regenerate plants in culture by somatic embryogenesis than its wild type progenitor Jemalong. To
understand the molecular basis for the regeneration capacity of this super-embryogenic line 2HA, using
Affymetrix GeneChip®, we have compared transcriptomes of explant leaf cultures of these two lines that
were grown on media containing the auxin NAA (1-naphthaleneacetic acid) and the cytokinin BAP (6benzylaminopurine) for two weeks, an early time point for tissue culture proliferation.
Results: Using Affymetrix GeneChip®, GCRMA normalisation and statistical analysis, we have shown that
more than 196 and 49 probe sets were significantly (p < 0.05) up- or down-regulated respectively more
than 2 fold in expression. We have utilised GeneBins, a database for classifying gene expression data to
distinguish differentially displayed pathways among these two cultures which showed changes in number
of biochemical pathways including carbon and flavonoid biosynthesis, phytohormone biosynthesis and
signalling. The up-regulated genes in the embryogenic 2HA culture included nodulins, transporters,
regulatory genes, embryogenesis related arabinogalactans and genes involved in redox homeostasis, the
transition from vegetative growth to reproductive growth and cytokinin signalling. Down-regulated genes
included protease inhibitors, wound-induced proteins, and genes involved in biosynthesis and signalling of
phytohormones auxin, gibberellin and ethylene. These changes indicate essential differences between the
super-embryogenic line 2HA and Jemalong not only in many aspects of biochemical pathways but also in
their response to auxin and cytokinin. To validate the GeneChip results, we used quantitative real-time
RT-PCR to examine the expression of the genes up-regulated in 2HA such as transposase, RNA-directed
DNA polymerase, glycoside hydrolase, RESPONSE REGULATOR 10, AGAMOUS-LIKE 20, flower promoting
factor 1, nodulin 3, fasciclin and lipoxygenase, and a down-regulated gene ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 3, all of
which positively correlated with the microarray data.
Conclusion: We have described the differences in transcriptomes between the M. truncatula superembryogenic line 2HA and its non-embryogenic progenitor Jemalong at an early time point. This data will
facilitate the mapping of regulatory and metabolic networks involved in the gaining totipotency and
regeneration capacity in M. truncatula and provides candidate genes for functional analysis.

Background
Plants are well known for their extraordinary capacity to
regenerate whole organisms from somatic cells. They
often retain plasticity and have the capability to reverse
the differentiation process and change their fate. The
remarkable plasticity of plant cells is well exemplified by
the capability of differentiated leaf cells to retain totipotency, the ability of a single cell to develop into a new
organism [1]. This process is known as somatic or asexual
embryogenesis (SE) whereby somatic cells differentiate
into embryos and ultimately into plants via a series of
characteristic morphological stages, particularly the later
stages, which resemble the zygotic stages of development
[2,3]. SE is the developmental restructuring of somatic
cells towards the embryogenic pathway and forms the
basis of cellular totipotency in higher plants [4,5]. Analyses of gene expression during somatic embryogenesis can
provide information about the early stages of plant development [2]. Large-scale transcription analyses of embryogenesis have also been reported in several species [6-12].
Numerous genes have been identified as specifically
expressed during somatic embryogenesis [13,14]. These
genes include hormone responsive genes such as auxin
inducible genes [15], late embryo abundant genes [16],
calmodulin [17], calcium dependent/calmodulin-independent protein kinases [18], calmodulin-like protein
kinases [19], somatic embryogenesis receptor-like kinase
(SERK) genes [3,4,20], homeobox containing genes
[21,22]; chitinases [23]; arabinogalactans [24], lipid
transfer proteins [25], WUSCHEL [26] and LEAFY COTYLEDON genes [27,28], to name a few. As yet little is
known about the induction and maintenance process of
the genes involved in the SE processes, especially in the
acquisition of totipotency of somatic cells. Avivi et al. has
shown that that acquisition of pluripotentiality involves
changes in DNA methylation pattern and reorganisation
of specific chromosomal subdomains. These changes lead
to activation of silent genes such as plant specific NAC (no
apical meristem-like) genes and VIP1, a gene encoding bZip nuclear protein that involved in acquisition or maintenance of pluripotentiality [29]. Several researchers have
sought to identify the very early plant cells in the explant
cell population that are competent to be committed to differentiation pathways. Using the SERK gene as a marker
during the examination of either carrot hypocotyls
explants [3], immature zygotic embryos of sunflower [20],
leaf explants of Dactylis glomerata L. (Poaceae) [30], or
developing ovules and embryos of Arabidopsis [31]. SERK
gene is expressed early in a small sub-population of cells
which are competent to form embryogenic cells [3]. Overexpression of the AtSERK1 gene in Arabidopsis cultures was
shown to induce somatic embryo formation [31]. Similarly, the over-expression of a transcription factor called
BABY BOOM (BBM) that shows similarity to the AP2/
EREPB multigene family of transcription factors [32]

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/110

under the control of the 35S promoter in transgenic plants
induced ectopic spontaneous somatic embryos and cotyledon-like structures on Arabidopsis and Brassica seedlings.
The BBM gene was originally isolated because it represented a gene that was expressed early in the initiation of
the differentiation of embryo development from immature pollen grains of Brassica napus (microspore embryogenesis) and appeared to be involved in the conversion
from vegetative to embryonic growth [32].
Legumes in general have proven recalcitrant at de novo
regeneration in vitro [33]. In Medicago truncatula, leaf
explants as well as protoplasts can form calli and subsequently the generation of embryos and then the development of plants [34]. Depending on the plant system,
auxin and/or cytokinin are required to enable embryogenesis to occur in culture [3,30,31,34]. In Medicago truncatula, Nolan et al. found that embryogenesis required both
auxin and cytokinin addition, although some embryos
could form on cytokinin alone [4]. In the leaf explant tissue culture system, there is an advantage of being able to
manipulate the type of differentiating cells observed by
changing the phytohormones added to the culturing
media [3,4,20], and embryos are initiated more rapidly in
4–6 weeks. This meristematic system has ideal attributes:
the regenerative capacity of the mutant line 2HA, which is
500 fold more embryogenic than its isogenic line
Jemalong [34,35]. When both M. truncatula cultivar (cv)
Jemalong and 2HA explant tissues are cultured in medium
with addition of auxin and cytokinin, the 2HA explants
form embryos. Generally cv Jemalong does not form
embryos but does produce early vascularisation in the
calli. The pasture legume M. truncatula (Australian barrel
medic) is one of the model systems for the analysis of the
unique biological and fundamental processes governing
legume biology. Recent genomic tools, advanced DNA
sequencing programs, EST libraries and Medicago GeneChip® have been developed for this legume and we previously have established proteome reference maps for M.
truncatula somatic embryogenesis cultures and compared
the proteome of the super-embryogenic line 2HA with
that of non-embryogenic progenitor Jemalong [5,36]. In
this study, we have used leaf explant tissue cultures of
2HA and Jemalong to investigate gene expression profiles
and their changes during the early stage of regeneration
and to identify key regulatory factors and the early markers of cell competency for regeneration.

line 2HA and its progenitor Jemalong at day 0 and day 14.
They were grown on medium containing 10 μM NAA and
4 μM BAP. At two weeks, callus cells start to proliferate
and there are no morphological differences can be seen
between the 2HA and Jemalong. Thus, two weeks provides an early time point to compare proliferating cultures
of these two lines. The first appearance of embryos in 2HA
occurs after five weeks of culture, but not in Jemalong
[34,36]. To investigate gene expression profiles and their
changes during the early stage of regeneration, we profiled
and compared the transcriptomes of 2HA and Jemalong,
by extracting total RNA from three independently grown
two-week old cultures and analysing them on Affymetrix
Medicago genome arrays. An average of 46% (24,080 ±

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/110

572 probe sets) of the over 52,000 plant gene probe sets
of the Medicago Genome Array GeneChip produced
'present' calls when hybridised with biotin-labelled cRNA
from M. truncatula tissue culture similar with early reports
in root and leaf samples [37,38]. Following normalisation
with GCRMA, we identified only 196 probe sets (0.38% of
the total probe sets) that are at least 2.0 fold overexpressed (p < 0.05) in the super-embryogenic line 2HA
and only 49 probe sets (0.09% of the total probe sets) that
are over-expressed (p < 0.05) in the non-embryogenic
Jemalong. The vast majority of probe sets (over 99.5%)
did not show any significant change between the cultures.
The choice of 2-fold threshold is somewhat arbitrary but
in combination with student t test and its associated p values, it is intended to emphasize on major changes. We
also performed the Significance Analysis of Microarrays
(SAM) two-class unpaired analysis in order to identify a
more extensive list of differentially expressed genes [43].
We found that 560 and 107 probes were up- or down-regulated respectively (additional file 1). There were significant similarities between 2-fold cut-off method and SAM
two-class unpaired analysis. One hundred ninety five
probe sets were up-regulated in the embryogenic culture
by both analyses while 38 probe sets were down-regulated
(additional file 2). The full data set has been deposited in
the Gene Expression Omnibus database as accession
GSE8131 and the normalised data set is available in the
additional file 3.
Array verification
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was used to confirm the
level of expression of 10 transcripts from the array (Table
1). For all probe sets tested, the expression ratios displayed the same pattern of expression as the array normalised data but with amplified fold-changes. For instance,
probe set Mtr.10439.1.S1_at (MtEIN3) showed down-regulation by real-time RT-PCR in the embryogenic culture,
consistent with the array data. In average, the fold changes

in RT-PCR data were approximately three times higher
than that of array data indicating amplification of fold
changes by sensitive real-time RT-PCR analysis. However,
the fold changes were much closer to array un-normalised
data (3.4 times higher than the normalised array data;
data not shown) indicating normalisation may considerably reduce the signal differences. The functional significance of the transcripts validated by qRT-PCR is discussed
in more details below.
Functional classification of differentially expressed probe
sets
The Medicago genome array does not incorporate the
entire M. truncatula genome, it was created based on an
incomplete genome sequence and ESTs from the Medicago
truncatula Gene Index (MtGI). We have noted the inclusion of probe sets for IMGAG gene predictions and the
corresponding EST leading to a duplication of data, and
the absence of some consensus ESTs from MtGI available
at the time the chip was made and also incorrect annotation of some genes in both IMGAG and MtGI (data not
shown). Annotation of the probe sets on the Genome
array also varies widely in quality. To interpret the gene
expression data better, we have used GeneBins to provide
hierarchical functional classification modelled on KEGG
ontology [39,40]. This analysis made it apparent that the
metabolism seems to be different between the embryogenic and the non-embryogenic M. truncatula cultures
(Figure 2). About 35% percent of differentially expressed
probe sets could be assigned a functional classification
with GeneBins; of note 14.7% (p = 1.6E-4), 12.2% (p =
2.5E-8) and 12.2% (p = 3.7E-8) of transcripts differentially expressed are involved in carbohydrate metabolism,
lipid metabolism and the biosynthesis of secondary
metabolites respectively. Around 21% of differentially
expressed transcripts have no homolog, however by far
the largest class of probe sets that had significantly altered
expression in our analysis were unclassified with a
homolog (44%). This result led us to use other bioinformatics strategies to annotate the probe sets on the genome
array.

To further refine the functional classification and annotation of metabolic probe sets on the Medicago genome
array we used PathExpress [41]. Using this database we
were able to identify statistically significant over-representation of metabolic pathways in the embryogenic and
non-embryogenic cultures as shown in Table 2. Five metabolic pathways are significantly over-represented in the
embryogenic cultures. They are: (1) Sphingolipid (major
component of the plasma membrane, tonoplast, and
other endo-membranes of plant cells) metabolism [represented by over-expression of cytochrome P450s 86A1
(Mtr.39593.1.S1_at), 94A1 (Mtr.51652.1.S1_at), 71A1
(Mtr.33655.1.S1_at), 90D2 (Mtr.27152.1.S1_at), phos-

and lignin biosynthesis [represented by over-expression
of peroxidases (Mtr.7245.1.S1_at, Mtr.37599.1.S1_at,
Mtr.38167.1.S1_at, Mtr.51089.1.S1_at, Mtr.9899.1.S1_at,
Mtr.10375.1.S1_at, Mtr.38635.1.S1_at), caffeic acid 3-Omethyltransferase (Mtr.43098.1.S1_at) and cytochrome

(represented by over-expression of leucoanthocyanidin

(Mtr.44281.1.S1_at) and phosphatase phospho1

16-membered macrolides [quinone oxidoreductase
(Mtr.44591.1.S1_at)]. Two pathways are over-represented
in the non-embryogenic cultures. They are: (1) Ascorbate
and aldarate metabolism [represented by over-expression
of ascorbate oxidase (Mtr.9478.1.S1_at), cytochrome
P450s
90B1
(Mtr.19623.1.S1_at),
71D9
(Mtr.23217.1.S1_at and Mtr.47492.1.S1_at) and 94A1
(Mtr.45741.1.S1_at)]. (2) Biosynthesis of 12-, 14- and 16membered macrolides [represented by auxin inducible
quinone oxidoreductase (Mtr.18492.1.S1_at)].
We also annotated the array by comparing the data set
with the Arabidopsis Gene Family Information database
maintained by the Arabidopsis Information Resource
[42]. As of April 2007 the database contained 996 gene
families and 8,331 genes. Using Blast, we were able to
classify 3,159 Medicago probe sets into these families.
Forty one and ten of the over expressed probe sets from
the embryogenic and non-embryogenic cultures respectively were classified in the gene families. Two cytochrome
P450 families (CYP94C, p = 0.016 and CYP90B, p =
0.047) were significantly over-represented in the nonembryogenic line Jemalong (Additional file 4). Finally,
transcription factors (TFs) on the Genome array were predicted by homology relationship based on the Database
of Arabidopsis Transcription Factors [43]. This analysis
showed that 2,323 probe sets on the Genome array have
sequence homology to described plant TFs. Twenty one
predicted TFs were up-regulated in the embryogenic line
2HA cultures and six TFs were up-regulated in the nonembryogenic Jemalong cultures (Table 4 and Additional
file 5). The families represented in the embryogenic cultures are the basic/helix-loop-helix (bHLH), zinc finger
domain TFs C2C2-co-like and C2C2-DOF, response regulators (GARP-ARR-B), GRAS domain containing TFs
(GRAS), MADS-box TFs (MADS) and MYB DNA-binding
domain TFs (MYB). The TF families represented in the
non-embryogenic cultures are APETALA 2 and ethylene-

auxin-responsive protein/indoleacetic acid-induced protein (AUX/IAA) and ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 3 (EIN3).
With the exception of bHLH and zinc finger containing
TFs, the TF gene families are plant specific. We confirmed
the expression of several TFs betweens the cultures of two
lines using qRT-PCR (Table 1).
Phytohormone biosynthesis and signalling
Although GeneBins and PathExpress are valuable tools to
identify gene classes and molecular pathways in general,
they are not designed to identify plant specific pathways
such as phytohormone biosynthesis and signalling. Thus,

we manually analysed the differentially displayed genes
involved in these processes. We have identified two probe
sets Mtr.30770.1.S1_at & Mtr.10439.1.S1_at that are
homologues to Arabidopsis ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3
(EIN3). These two probe sets were down-regulated 2.6
fold and 1.8 fold respectively, in the embryogenic 2HA
cultures. Similarly, a probe set for GA2-oxidase (GA2ox)
(Mtr.33914.1.S1_at)
and
a
probe
set
(Mtr.22904.1.S1_s_at) for an IAA/AUX gene was downregulated in the embryogenic 2HA cultures. In contrast, a
response regulator (MtRR1, Mtr.43735.1.S1_at) was upregulated the embryogenic 2HA cultures. This was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR (Table 1).

Comparison of gene expression between the embryogenic
cultures and seed development
To identify common genes expressed between embryogenic cultures (somatic embryogenesis) and developing
seeds (zygotic embryogenesis), we have compared our
data to that from the Medicago Expression Atlas [44]. We
have chosen developing seeds at 10 days after pollination
since this is the earliest time point available for seed development in the Atlas and contrasted it to leaf. A total of
12,954 probe sets showed differentially display between
the developing seed at ten days after pollination and leaf
samples. Over 6,800 probe sets were up-regulated in the
developing seeds at least two fold (P < 0.05), of which 14
were also up-regulated in the embryogenic cultures when
compared to non-embryogenic cultures (additional files 6
and 7). These include a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)
transcription
factor
(Mtr.51379.1.S1_at),
MtRR1
(response regulator, Mtr.43735.1.S1_at), a putative phosphatase (Mtr.10566.1.S1_at), an E1-E2 type ATPase
(Mtr.26397.1.S1_s_at), a serine carboxypeptidase
(Mtr.10023.1.S1_at),
a
GDSL-motif
lipase
(Mtr.13241.1.S1_at), a peroxidase (Mtr.10375.1.S1_at),
two
nodulins
(Mtr.11717.1.S1_at
and
Mtr.41025.1.S1_at),
a
fatty
acid
elongase
(Mtr.49305.1.S1_at) and four unknown proteins
(Mtr.35655.1.S1_at,
Mtr.18491.1.S1_at,
Mtr.38330.1.S1_at and Mtr.14656.1.S1_at). Over 6,000
probe sets were down-regulated in the developing seeds at
least two fold (P < 0.05), of which 6 were also down-regulated in the embryogenic cultures when compared to
non-embryogenic cultures (additional files 6 and 7). these
include transcription factor EIL1 (Mtr.10439.1.S1_at), a
H+-transporting ATPase Mtr.5635.1.S1_at), Snakin-like
cysteine rich protein (Mtr.12742.1.S1_at), a patatin-like
phospholipase (Mtr.37859.1.S1_at), a thaumatin-like
protein (Mtr.33691.1.S1_at) and a hypothetical protein
(Mtr.43627.1.S1_at). In brief, we have identified a small
number probe sets that were either up- or down-regulated

in both the embryogenic cultures and the developing
seeds. These include transcription factors such as response
regulator MtRR1 and EIN3, nodulins and unknown proteins (additional file 6). Further investigation of these proteins will shed light on the similarities between somatic
and zygotic embryogenesis.
Comparison between the array and proteomics
We also compared our array data with the proteome data
obtained for the explant leaf cultures of 2HA and
Jemalong [36]. 16 protein spots were reportedly identified
as differentially displayed proteins between the explant
leaf cultures of 2HA and Jemalong after 2, 5 and 8 weeks
of culture. Although all of the corresponding genes were
present on the array, none of them showed differential
display when used 2 fold cut-off and student t test (data
not shown). Thus, we were not able to find any correlation between transcriptomics and proteomics of the
explant leaf cultures of 2HA and Jemalong. This probably
due to the fact that only a very limited number of differentially displayed proteins were identified by proteomics,
most of which showed differential display only at the later
stages of culture (5 and 8 weeks of culture) but not at the
early stage (at two weeks) at which this microarray analysis was focused on.

Discussion
During the initial phases of organogenesis somatic cells
progress through a series of events referred to as differentiation, competence acquisition, induction and determination [20]. Most in vitro cultures require auxin in the
medium to initiate these steps while sunflower immature
zygotic embryos do not. They do, however require cytokinin to induce somatic embryogenesis [20,45]. Working
with immature zygotic embryos of sunflowers, Thomas et
al. showed that the time of exposure to a specific medium
was fundamental to the commitment to a particular morphogenic pathway [20]. This period was described as

Page 6 of 14

BMC Plant Biology 2008, 8:110

embryogenic competence during the morphogenic induction. The period lasted for three days when the commitment could be reversed by changing the medium.
However, after four days it could not be altered and thus
an irreversible step was taken within the competent cells
toward a particular organogenesis pathway. Seven days of
pre-treatment with auxin can interrupt somatic embryo
formation in M. truncatula [46]. And at two weeks, the
explant leaves start to proliferate. Thus, we reasoned that
comparing transcriptomes of two-week old tissue cultures
of super-embryogenic 2HA and its non-embryogenic progenitor Jemalong would reveal important genes involved
in early steps of regeneration and acquiring totipotency.
The transcriptomic analysis has revealed changes in gene
expression between the super-embryogenic line and the
non-embryogenic line of M. truncatula, although the vast
majority of probe sets (over 99.5%) did not show any significant change between the cultures. The differentially
expressed genes include genes involved in various metabolic pathways, flavonoid biosynthesis, hormone biosynthesis and signalling and genes involved in gene
regulation.
Arabinogalactan proteins
We have identified five probe sets (Mtr.18380.1.S1_at,
Mtr.10992.1.S1_at,
Mtr.17361.1.S1_at,
Mtr.51607.1.S1_at and Mtr.50900.1.S1_at) belonging to
Beta-Ig-H3 fasciclin-like arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs)
that are up-regulated in the embryogenic cultures of 2HA
at least two fold. AGPs are implicated in diverse developmental roles including somatic embryogenesis [47]
although their exact functions remain unclear. AGPs containing N-acetylglucosamine can be a substrate for chitinase [48] leading to the release of oligosaccharide signal
molecules that are necessary to induce somatic embryo
formation [49]. The involvement of extracellular signal
molecules in somatic embryogenesis has been reported in
several plant species. It was shown that when non-embryogenic cultures were treated with growth medium conditioned by super-embryogenic cultures, the cultures
became embryogenic [50]. Several components in the
conditioned growth medium have been found to promote
somatic embryogenesis. These components include chitinases [23] and AGPs [51-54]. It has been suggested that
oligosaccharides released from AGPs by a chitinase act as
signal molecules stimulating somatic embryogenesis [55].
However, the role of AGPs in the induction of somatic
embryogenesis in M. truncatula is not understood yet.
Genes involved in transition from vegetative growth to
reproductive growth
We have identified an Arabidopsis ortholog of FLOWERING PROMOTING FACTOR1 (AtFPF1) that was 2.3 fold
up-regulated in 2HA (Mtr.41073.1.S1_at). AtFPF1 is one
of the important genes involved in the genetic control of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/110

flowering time in Arabidopsis. It is expressed in apical
meristems immediately after photoperiodic induction of
flowering in long-day plants, which flower only when
exposed to long days [56]. During the transition to flowering, the FPF1 gene is expressed at the same time as
LEAFY and earlier than APETALA1, two key unrelated TFs
in flower initiation. FPF1 modulates the acquisition of
competence to flower in the apical meristem. Over-expression of FPF1 leads to early flowering in Arabidopsis [57].
Similar results were also reported in tobacco [58]. However in rice, it has been shown that it also plays a role in
the initiation of adventitious roots [59,60] and it has been
reported that the same gene was induced by salt treatments in M. truncatula roots and may contribute to the
reacquisition of root growth, notably through the emergence of lateral roots [61]. Another flowering promoting
gene that was up-regulated (2.3 fold) in 2HA is AGAMOUS-LIKE 20 (AGL20, also known as SUPPRESSOR OF
OVEREXPRESSION
OF
CO
1
or
SOC1,
Mtr.47174.1.S1_at) encodes a MADS box TF. In Arabidopsis, its ortholog was identified as a gene downstream
of another MADS box TF FLC [62]. Activation of AGL20
causes early flowering despite strong expression of FLC,
and knock out of AGL20 causes late flowering, suggesting
that it is a flowering activator [62]. AGL20 is positively
regulated by the long day pathway through CO, and negatively regulated by the autonomous/vernalisation pathway through FLC [62,63]. Since expression of AGL20 is
regulated by signals from more than one flowering pathway it is referred to as a floral pathway integrator [64,65].
These genes function in 'cascades' within four promotive
pathways, the 'photoperiodic', 'autonomous', 'vernalisation', and 'gibberellin' pathways, which all converge on
the 'integrator' genes AGL20 (SOC1) and FLOWERING
LOCUS T (FT) [66]. It has been shown that FLC directly
interacts with the AGL20 and FT genes in vivo [67]. Probe
set Mtr.7513.1.S1_at was up-regulated in 2HA and
encodes a CONSTANS-like TF that are ortholog of
At1g25440, which displayed root-specific expression [68]
and are strongly repressed in N starvation [69] suggesting
biological functions beyond promoting flowering.
Thus, we have identified three genes that were up-regulated in 2HA have similarities to the genes involved in
transition from vegetative growth to reproductive growth,
suggesting that initiation of both reproductive growth and
regeneration share similar molecular processes.
Nodulins
We identified eight genes classified as nodulins including
early
nodulin
75
(Mtr.38422.1.S1_at),
MtN3s
(Mtr.8585.1.S1_at & Mtr.11146.1.S1_at), MtN13
(Mtr.33137.1.S1_s_at & Mtr.37852.1.S1_at), nodulin 26
(Mtr.36842.1.S1_s_at)
and
other
nodulins
Mtr.43745.1.S1_at & Mtr.43508.1.S1_at). MtN3 protein

contains MtN3 and saliva related transmembrane protein
domain (Mtr.8585.1.S1_at & Mtr.11146.1.S1_at) and
reported to be induced during nodulation in M. truncatula
[70]. It has been shown in ascidian Ciona intestinalis that a
gene encoding an MtN3/saliva family transmembrane
protein is essential for tissue differentiation during embryogenesis [71]. MtN13, a homologue of plant defence proteins (Pathogenesis-related protein Bet v I family) has
been reported to be nodulation/symbiosis-specific in M.
truncatula [70]. Nod26, a member of plant aquaporins,
also has been shown to be involved in nodulation
[72,73]. Another non-nodulin proteins that has shown to
be involved in nodule development is cycloartenol synthase [70]. We have detected the same gene
(Mtr.4710.1.S1_s_at) highly up-regulated in the embryogenic line 2HA. These indicate that several genes expressed
during nodule formation also expressed during regeneration in M. truncatula.
Phytohormone biosynthesis and signalling
Two probe sets Mtr.10439.1.S1_at & Mtr.30770.1.S1_at
that are homologues to Arabidopsis ETHYLENE
INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3) were down-regulated 2.6 fold and
1.8 fold respectively, in the embryogenic line 2HA. The
probe set Mtr.10439.1.S1_at was also down-regulated in
the developing seeds at 10 days after pollination when
compared to leaf samples, indicating some similarities
between somatic and zygotic embryogenesis. EIN3 acts as
a positive regulator at the most downstream position of
the ethylene signal transduction pathway [74]. EIN3
encodes a transcription factor that belongs to a small family that includes EIN3 and various EIN3-like (EIL) proteins in Arabidopsis and it works downstream of EIN2
[74] and upstream of AtERF1, an early ethylene responsive gene [75]. Recently, Achard et al. has shown that activated ethylene signalling reduces bioactive Gibberellin
(GA) levels and enhances the accumulation of DELLAs,
and ethylene acts on DELLAs via the CTR1-dependent ethylene response pathway, most likely downstream of the
transcriptional regulator EIN3. Ethylene-enhanced DELLA
accumulation in turn delays flowering via repression of
the floral meristem-identity genes LEAFY and AGL20
(SOC1), establishing a link between the CTR1/EIN3dependent ethylene and GA-DELLA signalling pathways
[76].

We have observed that a probe set for GA2-oxidase
(GA2ox) (Mtr.33914.1.S1_at) was up-regulated in the
non-embryogenic Jemalong cultures. GA has been
implied to have an role in somatic embryogenesis in carrots [77], in Arabidopsis [78] and in Japanese cedar [79].
GA2ox, introduces a hydroxyl group at the 2β position,
inactivating the GA molecule so that it cannot be converted into active forms [80,81]. These indicate that there
is a reduction in active GA in this the non-embryogenic

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/110

line Jemalong. However, the measuring of active GA contents in these lines is required to confirm such indication.
It has been shown in Arabidopsis that AGL20 (or SOC1)
is induced by GA [82] and we found AGL20 (SOC1,
Mtr.47174.1.S1_at) to be up-regulated in the embryogenic line 2HA. The up-regulation of AGL20 correlates
well with the up-regulation of GA2ox and down-regulation of EIN3 in the embryogenic line. Thus, our findings
suggest that GA and ethylene may be involved in the
acquisition of regeneration capacity in M. truncatula and
indicate that AGL20 may be a key regulator that links GA
and ethylene signalling.
We have identified a probe set (Mtr.22904.1.S1_s_at) for
an IAA/AUX gene that was down-regulated in the embryogenic cultures. The corresponding gene is an ortholog of
Arabidopsis IAA20 (AT2G46990). In Arabidopsis, IAA20
protein is long-lived and its longevity was not influenced
by auxin suggesting they may play a novel role in auxin
signalling [83]. We previously have shown that auxin (1naphthaleneacetic acid) pre-incubation explant leaf tissues can irreversibly interrupt somatic embryo formation
in the M. truncatula embryogenic line 2HA [46]. Thus, upregulation of IAA20 ortholog in M. truncatula supports
motion that the prolonged auxin signalling may have
adverse effect on embryo formation.
Proliferation of undifferentiated callus tissue, greening,
and the formation of shoot structures are all cytokinindependent processes. We have identified a response regulator (MtRR1, Mtr.43735.1.S1_at) that is up-regulated in
the embryogenic cultures. This probe set was also up-regulated in the developing seeds at 10 days after pollination
when compared to leaf samples, indicating some similarities between somatic and zygotic embryogenesis. MtRR1
is an ortholog of Arabidopsis ARR10 (RESPONSE REGULATOR 10; At4g31920) that belongs to B-type response
regulators. It was reported that this gene is induced early
in M. truncatula roots during the symbiotic interaction
with Sinorhizobium meliloti [84]. There are other probe sets
for the genes involved in cytokinin biosynthesis and signalling. However, these were not changed between the
two cultures. For instance, there are two probe sets for adenylate isopentenyltransferases (cytokinin synthases,
Mtr.31420.1.S1_at & Mtr.12113.1.S1_at) in the array and
both probe sets did not expressed in both cultures. In contrast, Cytokinin Response 1, (CRE1, Mtr.12088.1.S1_at)
[84] and other cytokinin inducible genes cyclin D3
(Mtr.35281.1.S1_at and Mtr.41123.1.S1_at), KNAT
(Mtr.8842.1.S1_at),
SHOOT
MERISTEMLESS
(Mtr.13772.1.S1_at) and type A response regulators (cytokinin-inducible)
(Mtr.5343.1.S1_s_at,
Mtr.32159.1.S1_at, Mtr.5335.1.S1_at, Mtr.43919.1.S1_at,
Mtr.31738.1.S1_at and Mtr.174.1.S1_at) were also highly
expressed in both cultures. These indicate that there are

some differences between the embryogenic line 2HA and
the non-embryogenic line Jemalong in respond to cytokinin and MtRR1 may be an important regulator in the
acquisition of regeneration capacity in M. truncatula.

Conclusion
We have described differences in transcriptomes between
the M. truncatula super-embryogenic line 2HA and its
non-embryogenic progenitor Jemalong. Notably they
include significant variations in carbon and flavonoid
metabolism, phytohormone biosynthesis and signalling,
cell to cell communication and gene regulation. This data
will facilitate the mapping of regulatory and metabolic
networks involved in the acquisition of regeneration
capacity of the embryogenic lines such as 2HA, and may
lead to a better understanding of totipotency in M. truncatula and other legume species.

Methods
Plant materials, growth and tissue culture
M. truncatula cv Jemalong seed line 2HA and its progenitor Jemalong was used for the plant growth explant tissue
culture as described [36,85]. Seeds of M. truncatula cv
Jemalong were obtained from Professor Ray Rose (University of Newcastle, NSW, Australia). Plants were grown
under controlled growth cabinet conditions with 12 hr
photoperiod at 150 μmol m-2 s-1 with a day temperature of
23°C and a night temperature of 19°C and a relative
humidity of 80%. The basal medium used for the explant
leaf culture was P4, which is based on Gamborg's B5
medium as described [86]. In the usual culture procedure,
leaf explants were plated onto P4 medium containing 10
μM NAA (1-naphthaleneacetic acid, Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, USA) and 4 M BAP (6-benzylaminopurine,
Sigma-Aldrich). Cultures were incubated in the dark at
28°C.
DNA microarray analysis
The Affymetrix Medicago GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa
Clara, CA, USA) contained 61,200 probe sets: 32,167 M.
truncatula EST-based and chloroplast gene-based probe
sets (TIGR Gene Index version 8, Jan., 2005, 36,878
unique sequences); 18,733 M. truncatula IMGAG (International Medicago Genome Annotation Group) and
phase 2/3 BAC prediction-based probe sets; 1,896 M.
sativa EST/mRNA based probe sets; 8,305 Sinorhizobium
meliloti gene prediction-based probe sets.
RNA isolation, hybridisation and data pre-processing
Total RNA was extracted and purified from the proliferating leaf explant cultures of M. truncatula line 2HA and
Jemalong using the Qiagen RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Total RNA was quantified using
a NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer; RNA with an
absorbance A260/A280ratio >2.0 was quality tested using

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/110

the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Preparation of cRNA,
hybridisation, and scanning of the Test3 arrays and Medicago GeneChip® were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) (at
the Biomolecular Resource Facility, JCSMR, ANU). Briefly,
double-stranded cDNA was synthesised from 5 to 8 μg of
each RNA sample via oligo T7-(dT)24 primer-mediated
reverse transcription. Biotin-labelled cRNA was generated
using the Enzo BioArray kit (Affymetrix), purified using
RNeasy spin columns (Qiagen), and then quantified by
spectrophotometer. Fifteen to 20 μg of each biotinlabelled fragmented cRNA sample was used to prepare
300 μL of hybridisation mixture. Aliquots of each sample
(100 μL) were hybridised onto Test3 arrays to check the
quality of the samples prior to hybridisation (200 μL)
onto the Medicago genome arrays. The arrays were
washed with optimised wash protocols, stained with
strepdavidin/phycoerythrin followed by antibody amplification, and scanned with the Agilent GeneArray Scanner
(Affymetrix).
Data pre-processing
Raw Affymetrix data (cel files) were normalised with the
GCRMA (GC content – Robust Multi-Array Average) algorithm (ver. 2.2.0) including quantile normalisation and
variance stabilisation [87], using the Affymetrix package
of the bioconductor software [88]. The normalised average of the replicates was then log transformed in base 2 to
reduce the proportional relationship between random
error and signal intensity. Differentially expressed probe
sets were identified by evaluating the log2 ratio between
the two conditions associated to a standard t-test [89],
adjusted for multiple testing by the False Discovery Rate
(FDR) approach [90]. All probe sets that differed more
than to two-fold with a t-test P-value ≤ 0.05 were considered to be differentially expressed. The Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) two-class unpaired analysis
[91] was also performed in order to identify a more extensive list of differentially expressed genes, with the measure
significant fold change set at 2.0 and a false discovery rate
<8.4%. The expected proportion of significantly different
features (p0) was set to 0.95.
Data analysis
Functional categories significantly associated (P-value ≤
0.05, adjusted using the FDR correction) with the up- and
down-regulated sequences were identified using
GeneBins, a database that provides a hierarchical functional classification modelled on the KEGG ontology [92]
of probe set sequences represented on Affymetrix arrays
[40]. We used PathExpress [93], a web-based tool based
on the KEGG Ligand database [94], to detect whether
probe sets associated with a metabolic pathway or subpathway were statistically over-represented in the differentially expressed sets of sequences (P-value ≤ 0.05). In

addition, probe sets of the Affymetrix Medicago Genome
Array were assigned to gene families described in the TAIR
database [95] and to transcription factor families provided by the Database of Arabidopsis Transcription Factors [43] based on their sequence similarity with
Arabidopsis thaliana proteins. Blastx [96] was used to find
the best match (E-value ≤ 10-8) for the sequences representing each probe set (i.e. sequences derived from the
most 5' to the most 3' probe in the public UniGene cluster). The differentially expressed sets of sequences were
compared to the composition of each gene family to identify if a certain category was statistically over-represented.
For each test, a P-value, representing the probability that
the intersection of the list of up- or down-regulated probe
sets with the list of probe sets belonging to the given gene
family occurs by chance, was calculated using the hypergeometric distribution [97].
Sequence analysis
Sequences of interest were analysed using BLAST and multiple sequence alignments to identify genes and proteins
with sequence similarity from Arabidopsis. To identify
orthologs in Arabidopsis, AffyTrees was used http://bioin
foserver.rsbs.anu.edu.au/utils/affytrees/. AffyTrees automatically detects sequence orthologs based on phylogenetic trees.
Comparing to Medicago Expression Atlas
To identify common genes expressed between embryogenic cultures and developing seeds, we have compared
our data to that of the Medicago Expression Atlas [44]. We
have chosen seed10d (Developing seeds at early embryogenesis – 10 days after pollination) since it is the earliest
time point for seed development available in the Atlas and
contrasted this to leaf (4-week old trifolia that were harvested without their petioles but with their petiolule) and
have computed the average between all replicates, ratios
(seed/leaf), log2 (ratio), t test adjusted with FDR
method). Then we compared these lists with our data to
see any overlap.
Real-time RT-PCR
Total RNAs were isolated from the proliferating leaf
explant cultures of M. truncatula line 2HA and Jemalong
using the Qiagen RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen) and the
total RNA was treated in 1× buffer with 2 U of DNAse I
(Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) added to the reaction and
incubated for 30 min at 37°C. The reaction was stopped
by adding DNase Removal Reagent (Ambion). cDNA synthesis was done using 2 μg total RNA. One microliter of 5
μM oligo dT18 primer (5'-TTT/TTT/TTT/TTT/TTT/TTT-3')
was added to the reaction, and incubated for 10 min at
70°C, then chilled on ice. First strand mix containing 1×
buffer, 10 mM DTT, 1.25 mM of each dATP, dCTP, dTTP,
dGTP, was added to a total volume of 20 μL and incu-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/110

bated for 5 min at 42°C. Then 200 U SuperScript™ III
reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California,
USA). For the no reverse transcriptase control, water was
added instead of SuperScript III reverse transcriptase. The
reaction was stopped by incubating at 70°C for 15 min
and the final reaction either stored at -20°C or used for
PCR immediately. For the real-time reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), gene specific primers (Table 3) were designed using Primer Express software
(Applied Biosystems) and ordered from Sigma Genosys
(Castle Hill, NSW, Australia). The PCR was carried out in
a total volume of 10 μL containing 0.3 μM of each primer,
1× SYBR green PCR master mix (PE Applied Biosystems).
Reactions were amplified as follows: 95°C for 10 min,
then 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 sec, 60°C for 1.5 min.
Amplifications were performed in 384-well clear optical
reaction plates (Applied Biosystems) with an ABI PRISM
7900 Sequence Detection System (at the Biomolecular
Resource Facility, JCSMR, ANU) using version SDS 2.2.2
software (Applied Biosystems) to analyse raw data. The
absence of genomic DNA and non-specific by-products of
the PCR amplification was confirmed by analysis of dissociation curves and agarose gel electrophoresis of the PCR
products (data not shown). The gels were stained with 0.5
μg mL-1 ethidium bromide, visualised using an UV transilluminator and then photographed. Normalisation was
done as described [46] using MtUBQ10 (Ubiqutin10,
TC100142) as a control gene. Three biological repeats
(independent tissue culture experiments performed in
parallel under same growth condition) were done for each
treatment.
