Amino-terminal extension present in the
methionine aminopeptidase type 1c of
Mycobacterium tuberculosis is indispensible for its
activity

Abstract
Background: Methionine aminopeptidase (MetAP) is a ubiquitous enzyme in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes,
which catalyzes co-translational removal of N-terminal methionine from elongating polypeptide chains during
protein synthesis. It specifically removes the terminal methionine in all organisms, if the penultimate residue is
non-bulky and uncharged. The MetAP action for exclusion of N-terminal methionine is mandatory in 50-70% of
nascent proteins. Such an activity is required for proper sub cellular localization, additional processing and
eventually for the degradation of proteins.
Results: We cloned genes encoding two such metalloproteases (MtMetAP1a and MtMetAP1c) present in
Mycobacterium tuberculosis and expressed them as histidine-tagged proteins in Escherichia coli. Although they have
different substrate preferences, for Met-Ala-Ser, we found, MtMetAP1c had significantly high enzyme turnover rate as
opposed to MtMetAP1a. Circular dichroism spectroscopic studies as well as monitoring of enzyme activity indicated
high temperature stability (up to 50°C) of MtMetAP1a compared to that of the MtMetAP1c. Modelling of MtMetAP1a
based on MtMetAP1c crystal structure revealed the distinct spatial arrangements of identical active site amino acid
residues and their mutations affected the enzymatic activities of both the proteins. Strikingly, we observed that 40
amino acid long N-terminal extension of MtMetAP1c, compared to its other family members, contributes towards the
activity and stability of this enzyme, which has never been reported for any methionine aminopeptidase.
Furthermore, mutational analysis revealed that Val-18 and Pro-19 of MtMetAP1c are crucial for its enzymatic activity.
Consistent with this observation, molecular dynamic simulation studies of wild-type and these variants strongly
suggest their involvement in maintaining active site conformation of MtMetAP1c.
Conclusion: Our findings unequivocally emphasized that N-terminal extension of MtMetAP1c contributes towards
the functionality of the enzyme presumably by regulating active site residues through “action-at-a-distance”
mechanism and we for the first time are reporting this unique function of the enzyme.

Background
The N-terminal methionine excision (NME) is an essential
co-translational proteolytic process responsible for the
diversity of amino-termini of proteins in both prokaryotes
and eukaryotes [1]. It is an irreversible reaction, which
occurs soon after N-terminal residues of the nascent polypeptide chain emerge from the ribosome exit tunnel

Research, Sector 39A, Chandigarh 160 036, India

before the commencement of protein folding [2]. The
enzyme involved in the process is known as methionine
aminopeptidase (MetAP), which specifically removes the
terminal methionine in all organisms, if the penultimate
residue is non-bulky and uncharged [3]. In prokaryotes
and eukaryotic organelles where the initiator methionine
is formylated, NME requires the action of another metalloprotease, peptide deformylase in addition to MetAP,
which removes the N-formyl group present on all synthesized nascent polypeptides. In fact, removal of N-formyl
group is a prerequisite for the subsequent action of

MetAP [4]. Nevertheless, the MetAP action for exclusion
of N-terminal methionine is mandatory in 50-70% of nascent proteins. Such an activity is required for proper sub
cellular localization, additional processing and eventually
for the degradation of proteins [5].
MetAPs are ubiquitous in distribution and are highly
conserved throughout the phylogeny. They were initially
grouped in two classes, MetAP1 and MetAP2 on the
basis of sequence comparison. The type 2 enzymes, in
contrast to type 1, have an approximately 60 amino acid
long a helical domain inserted within the catalytic
region of the enzyme [6,7]. This helical sub-domain
shares neither sequence nor structural homology with
any other known protein. The MetAPs are further
divided in two subclasses on the basis of absence (subclass a) or presence (subclass b) of N-terminal extension
[8]. The N-terminal extension present in type 1b contains two zinc finger motifs while that of type 2b has
alternate stretches of polyacidic and polybasic residues.
Recently, two new subclasses, type 1c and 2c, have been
introduced where ~40 amino acid long N-terminal
extension is present but zinc finger motif is absent
[9,10].
Apart from several types of MetAPs, presence of more
than one copy of functional genes encoding this enzyme
has been reported in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In
human, there are two such well characterized enzymes,
which have been shown to be involved in cell proliferation
[11,12]. Among four isoforms of MetAPs in Plasmodium
falciparum, three exhibited enzymatic activities [13].
Genetic studies further established the essentiality of this
enzyme in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes [14-16]. These
findings led to the assumption that MetAP would be an
ideal drug target and screening/designing of inhibitors
against this enzyme might help in planning to combat the
problem of rapid resurgence of diseases due to emergence
of drug resistant strains of different pathogens. In this context, we focussed on tuberculosis, which is caused by
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and responsible for considerable human mortality throughout the world in recent
years.
Although bacteria generally have single MetAP1,
mycobacterial genome revealed the presence of 2-4
putative genes for MetAP1; for instance M. tuberculosis
has two genes mapA (Rv0734) and mapB (Rv2861c)
encoding MtMetAP1a and MtMetAP1c respectively.
Although, crystal structure of MtMetAP1c was solved as
an apoenzyme and in complex form [9], biochemical
characterization of the two MtMetAPs has not been
reported until very recently [17-21]. However, detailed
structure-function analysis of these enzymes has not yet
been carried out. In this scenario, we concentrated on
both these MtMetAP1s and in this article we report

their distinct characteristics. Furthermore, we provide
here evidence that catalytic domain of MtMetAP1c
alone is not sufficient for the enzyme activity.

Results
MtMetAP1a and MtMetAP1c exhibit subtle difference in
their behaviour

The mapA and mapB genes from M. tuberculosis were
PCR amplified, cloned in pET-28c and expressed in
E. coli strain BL21(DE3). The recombinant N-terminal
His-tagged proteins were purified to near homogeneity
by immobilized metal affinity chromatography using NiNTA resin. The purified proteins, on resolving in SDSPAGE when visualized in Coomassie Brilliant Blue
stained gels, exhibited bands at 37.3 ± 1.7 kDa (n = 4)
and 39.1 ± 1.2 kDa (n = 4) for MtMetAP1a and MtMetAP1c, respectively. The authenticity of the expressed
proteins was further confirmed by Western blotting
using anti-His antibody (data not shown). MtMetAP1a
and MtMetAP1c displayed maximum activity with MetGly-Met-Met and Met-Ala-Ser respectively. The enzymatic specificity for the terminal methionine residue
was confirmed by using Gly-Gly-Ala as the substrate
and as expected both the enzymes were unable to
hydrolyze it (Figure 1A). Furthermore, using different
peptides as substrates revealed that at least a tripeptide
is the prerequisite for their functionality, since both the
enzymes showed almost negligible activity with the
dipeptide Met-Gly.
Activities of purified enzymes (1.7 nM for MtMetAP1a
or 0.038 nM for MtMetAP1c) as a function of increasing
concentrations (0.75-8 mM) of substrate (Met-Gly-MetMet for MtMetAP1a or Met-Ala-Ser for MtMetAP1c)
yielded typical Michaelis-Menten curves (Figure 1B).
Interestingly, kinetic parameters determined by fitting the
data to Michaelis-Menten equation for both the enzymes
for their preferred substrate indicated that they were active
(Table 1; see Km and kcat values with Met-Gly-Met-Met
for MtMetAP1a and Met-Ala-Ser for MtMetAP1c; considering recombinant His-tagged proteins). Interestingly,
using Met-Ala-Ser as the substrate for both the enzymes
the catalytic efficiency of MtMetAP1c was strikingly high
(~350-fold) compared to that of the MtMetAP1a (Table 1;
k cat /K m = ~3 mM -1 s -1 as opposed to ~1156 mM -1 s -1 ).
Thus, our result is in consonance with a recent report that
MtMetAP1c is catalytically more efficient compared to
MtMetAP1a [20]. Expectedly, both the enzymes exhibited
a linear increase in activity as a function of increasing protein concentrations (r = 0.997 or 0.991; Figure 1B, insets at
both left and right panels).
Since MetAPs are known as dinuclear metalloproteases, we also monitored the mycobacterial enzyme
activities in response to EDTA, a metal ion chelator. As

was monitored for 15 min. 0.038 nM of purified protein was incubated for 5 min with increasing concentration of Met-Ala-Ser as substrate to
determine the kinetic parameters of MtMetAP1c (Right). Insets, effect of increasing amount of protein on the enzyme activity. (C) Effect of

Enzyme assays were carried out as described under ‘Methods’ following the incubation of purified MtMetAP1a (1.7 nM/reaction) or MtMetAP1c (0.038 nM/
reaction) proteins with different concentrations (0.75-8 mM) of Met-Ala-Ser (MAS) or Met-Gly-Met-Met (MGMM) as substrate. Km and Vmax values were calculated
from Non-linear regression analysis by fitting the data to Michaelis-Menten equation, and the results are expressed as mean ± SD. For calculating kcat values, the
molecular mass of recombinant enzyme(s) was considered as 29.5 kDa (for MtMetAP1a) or 33.1 kDa (for MtMetAP1c). Mean ± SD for kcat/Km was determined after
calculating it for individual experiment.

expected, metal ion chelator affected the activities of
both the enzymes. However, compared to that used for
MtMetAP1c enzyme activity of MtMetAP1a was inhibited at a lower concentrations of EDTA (Figure 1C).
Leucine aminopeptidase inhibitors like amastatin and
bestatin, have already been shown to inhibit MetAP
activity by binding to its metal centre [7]. As shown in
Figure 1C, amastatin affected both MtMetAP1a and
MtMetAP1c enzyme activities; magnitude of inhibition,
however, varied considerably between them (compared
to untreated control, ~80% decrease in MtMetAP1a as
opposed to ~45% in MtMetAP1c with 100 μM of amastatin). Bestatin, on the other hand, had no effect on the
enzymatic activities of both the proteins within the concentration range tested in our experimental conditions.
We further addressed the adaptability of MtMetAP1a and
MtMetAP1c enzymes to different temperatures. For this
purpose, both the enzymes following incubation at different
temperatures (4° or 30° or 37° or 50°C for 10 min) were
assayed at 30°C for their activities. The maximum activity
for both the enzymes was noticed between 30°-37°C. Interestingly, MtMetAP1a retained ~85% of its activity at 50°C
as opposed to ~25% by the MtMetAP1c compared to that
observed at 30°C (insets showing enzyme activities in left
and right panels of Figure 1D). This observation led to the
postulation that alteration in the enzyme activity might be
occurring as a result of heating and this would very likely
cause structural changes in both the proteins. This possibility was explored by incubating both the proteins to 50°C
and comparing their far-UV CD spectra between 190250 nm. MtMetAP1a retained (> 50%) of its secondary
structure on heating at 50°C while MtMetAP1c was
unfolded (compare insets showing CD spectrum in left and
right panels of Figure 1D). In fact, determination of Tm of
both the proteins by CD spectroscopy yielded values
of 53.6°C for MtMetAP1a and 42.7°C for MtMetAP1c
(Figure 1D). These findings, therefore, established the difference in the adaptive ability of MtMetAP1a to high temperature compared to that of the MtMetAP1c and bring an
end to the argument about the temperature tolerance of
the MtMetAP1s [17,20]. Thus, all these lines of evidence
implicated the existence of subtle differences in the behaviour of two mycobacterial MetAPs.

Contribution of active site residues on MtMetAP1 enzyme
activity

Nucleotide derived amino acid sequence alignment of
MtMetAP1a with MtMetAP1c revealed ~41% identity
(Figure 2A) and the crystal structure of MtMetAP1c
(PDB ID: 1YJ3) has already been resolved. Since MtMetAP1a did not show any significant identity with any
other protein in the PDB database, we used MtMetAP1c
as the template for modelling the structure of this
metalloprotease [9]. The modelled structure of MtMetAP1a was validated by PROCHECK and it shows that
98% residues are in the most favoured regions of Ramachandran plot. The monomer of each protein consists of
two pairs of a-helices (a1 to a4) packed on the either
side of the central antiparallel b-sheet (b3 and b4).
Interestingly, ~55% of the structure comprised of loops
connecting the secondary structural elements. However,
the 40 amino acid long N-terminal extension of MtMetAP1c, which is devoid of any secondary structural element, lies across the surface of its catalytic domain
(Figure 2B).
Structural analysis predicted the presence of His-88,
His-193 and Glu-219 in the active site of MtMetAP1a,
while residues like Asp-106, Asp-117, Glu-250 and Trp236 are lining the perimeter of the active site. The presence of homologous residues in MtMetAP1c implies
that the active site of both the proteins is essentially
conserved (Figure 2A). To gain an insight on their contribution towards the enzyme activity, we generated several point mutants (H88A, H193A, D117A, E219V,
W236L for MtMetAP1a and H114A, H212A, D131A,
E238A, W255L for MtMetAP1c). Interestingly, the variants do not show any appreciable enzymatic activity
even on using 10-fold excess protein compared to that
of the wild-type (Figure 2C). In fact, mutating W236L in
MtMetAP1a and W255L in MtMetAP1c led to complete
loss in the activity (Figure 2C), which is in contrast to
the report available with MetAP1 of E. coli [22]. Expression of all the variants, however, was authenticated by
Western blotting using anti-His antibody (insets, Figure
2C). To examine the effect of mutations on the secondary and tertiary structures of the MtMetAP1s, the CD
spectral studies were performed. Far-UV CD spectrum

of the mutant proteins of MtMetAP1a revealed that
H88A, D117A, E219V and W236L show reduction in
helical content. The trend of the data in the region of
200-210 nm suggests that the band with negative mean
residue ellipticity at lower wavelengths has reduced signal strength presumably owing to the conversion of
some helical regions to less ordered structures (Figure
2C, left panel, inset). Interestingly, mutant H193A shows
greater helicity than the wild-type protein. Far-UV CD
spectral studies of wild-type MtMetAP1c and its variants
revealed that in D131A although there is no significant
reduction in the mean residue ellipticity at the 200-210
nm range, it decreased at the 220-225 nm range (Figure
2C, right panel, inset). On the other hand, in H114A
and E238A reduction in band intensity was observed at
both 200-210 nm and 220-225 nm. In H212A and
W255L the band intensities at the 200-210 nm as well
as in 220-225 nm were further reduced (Figure 2C, right
panel, inset). Thus, the mutations affected secondary
structure of both the proteins and changes observed in
the near-UV CD spectra indicated alteration in their
aromatic environment (insets of Figure 2C, see both left
and right panels).
Role of N-terminal extension of MtMetAP1c on the
enzyme activity

The presence of 40 amino acid N-terminal extension
although not unusual among MetAP1s, its contribution
towards the enzymatic activity is not known as yet [23-25].
To elucidate this aspect, a series of N-terminal deletion
variants for MtMetAP1c were generated (Figure 3A) and
their enzyme activity was monitored (Figure 3B). Surprisingly, compared to the wild-type, deletion constructs
(Δ2-10, Δ2-15, Δ2-20, Δ2-30 and Δ2-40) displayed either
drastic decrease or no enzymatic activity (Figure 3B). Even
use of 10 fold higher amounts of proteins in our assay,
Δ2-10 or Δ2-15 exhibited only 30% activity while Δ2-20 or
Δ2-30 or Δ2-40 had no activity (Figure 3B). Thus, our
results argue that the catalytic domain alone is not sufficient for the enzymatic function of MtMetAP1c.
MtMetAP1c variants, like Δ2-20 or Δ2-30 or Δ2-40,
which did not show any enzyme activity, when stained
with Coomassie Brilliant Blue after resolving in SDSPAGE, displayed a progressive loss in the purity of the
proteins with the increase in the length of deleted
regions (Figure 3C, upper panel). The authenticity of
these mutant proteins was confirmed by Western blotting using anti-His antibody (Figure 3C, lower panel).
The effect of mutation was evident by the presence of
contaminating bands in the Ni-NTA purified samples
(Figure 3C, upper panel) and even reduced protein yield
(~4 mg for Δ2-20/Δ2-30/Δ2-40 as opposed to ~9 mg in
wild-type average yield from 1 litre culture of E. coli
cells). Analysis of its crystal structure revealed that the

Page 6 of 14

N-terminal extension present in MtMetAP1c wraps
around the surface of its catalytic domain in contiguous
crevice [9]. Hence, its truncation as a result of deletion
might have exposed the hydrophobic residues and
thereby destabilized the protein. This has been manifested presumably by exhibiting altered proteolytic property of MtMetAP1c variants and/or led to acquiring the
tendency to associate with other proteins [9].
Interestingly, reduction in the enzymatic activity was
also observed in Δ2-10 and Δ2-15 variants despite the
fact that the Ni-NTA purified proteins appear to be
similar in profile as has been observed with wild-type.
The far-UV CD spectra showed that they (Δ2-10 and
Δ2-15) are folded like the wild-type protein (Figure 3D).
A slight alteration observed in the near-UV CD spectra
for the Δ2-15 variant (Figure 3E) was very likely the
result of alteration in the micro-environment of Trp
present at the amino acid position 20. Nonetheless, it is
apparent from our results that the first 15 amino acids
of MtMetAP1c are important for the catalytic activity of
the enzyme.
Role of Val-18 and Pro-19 on MtMetAP1c enzyme activity

To elucidate, the presence of any conserved residues
between amino acid 15-20 of MtMetAP1c, we aligned
the amino acid sequence of the N-terminal extension
region of the MtMetAP proteins from Gram positive
bacteria. Multiple sequence analysis revealed that Val-18
and Pro-19 are two highly conserved residues in different MetAPs (Figure 4A). To investigate their role,
mutants replacing these two residues, one at a time
(V18A, V18G, P19A, P19G) or both at the same time
(V18AP19A and V18GP19G) were generated and the
enzymatic activities of the recombinant proteins were
monitored. Relative to wild type, V18A protein had
~30% activity while P19A and P19G exhibited ~65% and
35% activity respectively. On the other hand, V18G,
V18AP19A and V18GP19G variants were devoid of any
enzymatic activity (Figure 4B). Use of 10-fold excess of
protein in assays, V18A, P19A and P19G mutants displayed activities almost at par (78%-112%) with the
wild-type. However, use of V18G, V18AP19A and
V18GP19G proteins even at increasing amounts in
assays had hardly any activity (Figure 4B). These results
indicated that Val-18 and/or Pro-19, the residues present in N-terminal extension (not in the catalytic
domain) may contribute towards the enzymatic activity
of MtMetAP1c. Further, to monitor whether variation in
the activity of the mutant proteins could be due to
structural changes, far-UV CD studies were performed.
The analysis of CD spectra revealed that mutations
caused alteration in secondary structure of all the variants (Figure 4C). Compared to the wild type, mutation
of Val-18 or Pro-19 (V18A, P19G, V18AP19A) resulted

in the reduction of the negative band intensity in the
region of 205-208 nm of the mutant proteins (Figure
4C). In the variant P19A, the reduction in band intensity
was also observed at 222 nm (in addition to 205-208
nm), thereby indicating that the helical content was

reduced. In V18G significant reduction was observed
both at 205-208 nm and 222 nm. Thus, these results
suggested the importance of these two residues (Val-18
and Pro-19) exclusively and mutually towards the enzymatic activity of MtMetAP1c.

To have an idea on how the Val-18 and Pro-19 of
MtMetAP1c influenced the activity of the enzyme, we
used crystal structure of MtMetAP1c to perform the
Molecular dynamic (MD) simulation studies by introducing point mutation(s) at the site of interest (see ‘Methods’). Four MD simulations were performed in explicit
solvent conditions to examine the effect of specific
mutations on overall structure and on the interactions
of amino acids lining the active site of the protein.
Comparison of the trajectories between wild-type and
double mutant (V18GP19G) showed that overall fold of
mutant protein is retained (Figure 5A). However, specific and drastic changes in the positions of active site
residues were observed (Figures 5B and 5C). The conformational changes that initiated from the site of mutation (Val-18, Pro-19) propagated to the active site and
displaced His-114 as well as affected His-212 and Glu238. Analysis of trajectories of single mutants (V18G
and P19A) illustrated that stereo chemical structural
changes similar to that observed in double mutant
(V18GP19G) were present in V18G (Figure 5C). On the
contrary, MD simulation results of P19A appeared
much similar to that of the wild-type but the presence
of differential population of the ensemble at different
time could possibly explain the reduction in the activity
of this mutant protein (Figure 5C right panel). Thus, the
results of our MD simulation studies support our biochemical observations.

Discussion
MetAPs represent a unique class of metalloproteases that
catalyze the co-translational removal of N-terminal
methionine residue from the elongating polypeptide
chain during the process of protein synthesis [2]. Since
MetAP action in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes is
mandatory during nascent protein synthesis, the importance of this enzyme has long been realized. Though the
presence of two MetAP1s was known with the availability
of the M. tuberculosis genome sequence, both of them
(MtMetAP1a and MtMetAP1c) are active has been
shown recently by others [17,19,20] and also in this
study. However, it is still not known whether they are
merely complementing each other for their functionality
and therefore redundant within the genome or their presence is because of the specific needs of the bacterium.
Recently, it has been reported that MtMetAP1a knock
down caused ~75% viability of mycobacteria while elimination of MtMetAP1c resulted in 95% survival [20].
Since this enzyme from different sources has been
considered as a potential drug target, identification of
inhibitors against these enzymes, particularly for
M. tuberculosis MtMetAP1a is in progress [20]. However,
the initial step of structure-activity relationship between
these two proteins has not been addressed properly. In

this context, to carry out systematic study of these two
enzymes from M. tuberculosis, we have attempted here to
analyze MetAP1s to elucidate subtle differences in their
characteristics.
Our results indicated that MtMetAP1c had strikingly
high enzyme turnover rate with the same substrate (MAS)
compared to MtMetAP1a (~350-fold more; Table 1),
although they had different substrate preferences (Figure
1A). The outcome of our CD as well as activity assays with
these mycobacterial enzymes illustrate that MtMetAP1a
can sustain high temperature (up to 50°C) compared to
MtMetAP1c. In fact, Tm value calculated based on CD
spectra for MtMetAP1a was 53.6°C as opposed to 42.7°C
for MtMetAP1c (Figure 1D). To get an insight into the
cause of such differential behaviour of the two enzymes,
structure of MtMetAP1a was modelled and compared
with the available structure of MtMetAP1c (Figure 2B).
We observed that the active site residues in both the
MtMetAP1s are essentially same, though their arrangement in space is different (Figure 2B). Furthermore, these
amino acids are crucial because any alteration in them (for
both the enzymes) yielded an inactive protein (Figure 2C).
Thus it is logical to presume that this difference in the
arrangement may be responsible for the alteration in their
activity/functionality.
Sequence analysis revealed that the remarkable feature
of MtMetAP1c compared to MtMetAP1a, is the presence
of 40 amino acid long N-terminal extension. It has been
suggested that this extension may be involved in the
interaction of MtMetAP1c with the ribosome [9]. In
ScMetAP1 and HsMetAP2 deletion of N-terminal extension did not significantly alter the catalytic efficiency of
the enzymes [23-25]. However, such deletion in ScMetAP1 reduced its efficiency in rescuing the slow growth
phenotype of a map mutant [26]. Interestingly, the zinc
finger motif present in the N-terminal extension of
ScMetAP1 has been shown to be involved in its association with the ribosome [26]. In HsMetAP1, on the other
hand, these sequences have been implicated for the interaction of the enzyme with substrates and inhibitors [25].
This led us to explore the role of the N-terminal extension present in MtMetAP1c towards the activity of the
enzyme. We constructed a series of deletion mutants
removing nine (Δ2-10), fourteen (Δ2-15), nineteen (Δ220), twenty-nine (Δ2-30) and thirty-nine (Δ2-40) amino
acids from the amino terminal end of the MtMetAP1c
(Figure 3A). Enzyme assays with these constructs using
even 10 fold excess of proteins compared to the wildtype revealed that there was a considerable loss in activity
in Δ2-10 or Δ2-15 variants and no activity at all in
mutants, like Δ2-20 or Δ2-30 or Δ2-40 (Figure 3B). Intriguingly, following resolving in SDS-PAGE, analysis of the
deletion constructs in Coomassie Brilliant Blue stained
gels reflected that purification profile of Δ2-10 or Δ2-15

mutants was similar to that of the wild-type but variants
like Δ2-20, Δ2-30 and Δ2-40 exhibited loss in purity of
the proteins (Figure 3C, upper panel). Hence, it seems
logical to postulate that the amino acid residues between
15 and 20 of MtMetAP1c are crucial for its activity. Perhaps, deletion of residues beyond 19 from the N-terminal
end of MtMetAP1c renders the enzyme unstable or
exposes its hydrophobic patches, thereby increasing its
tendency to associate with the other proteins. In fact,
evaluation of structural changes through far-UV and
near-UV CD spectra revealed that up to 15 residues from
the N-terminal extension of MtMetAP1c are dispensable
for the folding of the protein (Figure 3D) but required for
its activity (Figure 3B). Thus, our results argue that the
N-terminal extension is important for the catalytic activity of MtMetAP1c protein, which is unlike the reports
available with ScMetAP1, HsMetAP1 and HsMetAP2
[23-25].
To identify the critical residue(s) for the activity of the
protein, we analyzed the sequence of MetAPs from different Gram positive bacteria with N-terminal extension
and found the presence of conserved Val-18 and Pro-19
in between amino acid residues 15 and 20 (Figure 4A).
This observation, prompted us to create point mutations
at 18th and 19th position of MtMetAP1c (one at a time or
together with type-to-type/drastic substitutions) and
examine their effect on the activity of the enzyme. While
V18A and P19A were partially active, V18AP19A did not
show any activity. On the other hand, P19G exhibited
partial activity but neither V18G nor V18GP19G were
active (Figure 4B). Further, to assess if these mutations
resulted in any structural alterations, far-UV CD studies
were carried out. Interestingly the mutation caused
alteration in the secondary structure of the protein. Thus,
our results argue the importance of these two residues
(Val-18 and Pro-19) exclusively and mutually towards the
enzymatic activity of MtMetAP1c. It appears very likely
that the structural alterations that occurred due to mutation at Val-18 and/or Pro-19 of MtMetAP1c affected the
active site conformation of the protein. In fact, MD simulations (both 5 ns and 50 ns) indicated that the conformational changes generated at the site of mutation
(V18GP19G and V18G) propagated via connecting loops
and helices to the enzyme active site resulting in the
alteration in the movement/positioning of residues like
His-114, His-212 and Glu-238 which are critical for the
enzyme activity as revealed in our biochemical studies
(Figure 2C). These variations in the V18GP19G or V18G
mutant proteins presumably made the active site environment unfavourable for any activity. Thus, our results
illustrate that residue(s) without being in the active site
of an enzyme is capable of modulating its activity, which
does not seem to be unusual [27,28].

Conclusion
Our findings unequivocally emphasize that N-terminal
extension of MtMetAP1c contributes towards the functionality of the enzyme by regulating active site residues
through “action-at-a-distance” mechanism and this is
presumably its unique function in MtMetAP1c, which
we are reporting for the first time. Since Val-18 and
Pro-19 are conserved residues throughout the Gram
positive bacterial MetAP1s with N-terminal extension, it
remains to be seen whether they are universal in contributing towards the functionality of the enzyme.
Methods
Materials

Restriction/modifying enzymes were obtained from New
England Biolab. All other fine chemicals including MetGly, Met-Ala-Ser, Met-Gly-Met-Met, Gly-Gly-Ala were
procured from Sigma Chemical Company. Ni-NTA
resin (Qaigen), ECL Western blotting detection kit, PCR
DNA/gel band purification kit, protein molecular weight
markers (GE Healthcare) and Herculase fusion DNA
polymerase (Stratagene) were commercially available.
Oligonucleotides used in this study were custom synthesized (IDT/Ocimum Biosolutions/Sigma).
DNA manipulation and generation of MtMetAP-mutants

Genes encoding two MetAP1, mapA (Rv0734) and
mapB (Rv2861c) of M. tuberculosis H37Rv (virulent
strain) exhibited 100% identity at the nucleotide level
with its avirulent strain (H37Ra). In this study, genomic
DNA isolated [29] from M. tuberculosis strain H37Ra
was used for PCR amplification of mapA and mapB
genes. For this purpose, gene specific primers incorporating restriction sites were designed (primers CK74 with
HindIII and CK140 with NheI sites for mapA; primers
CK64 with NdeI and CK65 with HindIII sites for mapB;
see Additional file 1, Table S1 for primer sequences)
based on published genome sequence [30] and PCR
reaction was carried out using Herculase fusion DNA
polymerase following manufacturer’s recommended protocol. This was followed by cloning of genes at NheI/
HindIII (for mapA) or NdeI/HindIII (for mapB) sites in
expression vector (pET-28c) using standard protocols
[31] to obtain pET-mapA or pET-mapB construct. PCR
was also employed for generation of different mutations
(H88A, H193A, D117A, E219V and W236L for MtMetAP1a and H114A, H212A, D131A, E238A, W255L,
V18A, V18G, P19A, P19G, V18AP19A, V18GP19G for
MtMetAP1c) including deletion mutants (Δ2-10, Δ2-15,
Δ2-16, Δ2-17, Δ2-18, Δ2-19, Δ2-20, Δ2-30, Δ2-40). For
each point mutation two external (CK74/CK140 and
CK64/CK65 for mapA and mapB respectively) and two
internal primers (incorporating mutation) were designed

(Additional file 1, Table S1). Two sets of primary (pETmapA/pET-mapB as the template) and one set of secondary (mixture of primary reaction products as the
template) PCR reactions were carried out for each
mutation. For constructing deletion mutants, pET-mapB
was used as template with two set of primers, one primer incorporating NdeI site (excluding N-terminal
region to be deleted) and another was external primer
(CK65). All these constructs including the wild-type (in
pET-28c) were individually transformed into E. coli
strains DH5a to build up DNA and in BL21 (DE3) for
expression/purification of His-tagged proteins. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing using an automated
DNA sequencer.
Expression and purification of recombinant proteins

Cells harboring pET-mapA or pET-mapB or different
mutant constructs were grown overnight (15 h at 37°C) in
LB broth (50 μg/ml kanamycin) and induced with 0.4 mM
IPTG at OD600 of ~0.8. Cells were harvested after 12 h following incubation at 16°C, resuspended in lysis buffer
(100 mM Tris, pH 7.5 containing 300 mM NaCl for
MtMetAP1a or 200 mM NaCl for MtMetAP1c, 10 mM
imidazole, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml
of pepstatin and 1 μg/ml of leupeptin or inhibitor cocktail,
Roche) and sonicated. The supernatant fraction was
further loaded on a Ni-NTA affinity column, washed with
10 bed volumes of 100 mM Tris pH 7.5 containing
300 mM (for MtMetAP1a) or 200 mM (for MtMetAP1c)
NaCl with 20 mM imidazole. The purified protein(s) was
eluted with elution buffer comprising of 100 mM Tris, pH
7.5 containing either 300 mM NaCl/250 mM imidazole
(for MtMetAP1a) or 200 mM NaCl/150mM imidazole
(for MtMetAP1c). Following removal of imidazole by dialysis at 4°C for ~14h (dialysis buffer: 100 mM Tris, pH 7.5
with either 300 mM NaCl for MtMetAP1a or 150mM
NaCl for MtMetAP1c; buffer changed: 4 times), protein
was estimated [32] and stored at -80°C until used.
Methionine aminopeptidase activity

MetAP activity was measured by a colorimetric assay
performed at 30°C in a microtiter plate by monitoring
the absorbance of oxidized o-dianisidine at 440 nm [33].
Since the assay system involves the use of CoCl 2 , we
determined its optimal amount (2 mM for MtMetAP1a
and 0.2 mM for MtMetAP1c) to be used for the assessment of enzyme activity at our experimental conditions.
We found use of 2 mM CoCl2 did not inhibit MtMetAP1a enzyme activity and similar amount has also been
used for E. coli MetAP enzyme assay [34]. Briefly, in a
100 μl reaction volume MtMetAP1a (1.7 nM/reaction)
or MtMetAP1c (0.038 nM/reaction) protein was mixed
with a reaction mixture consisting of 100 mM Tris-HCl

Page 12 of 14

pH 7.5, 0.2 mM (for MtMetAP1c) or 2 mM (for MtMetAP1a) CoCl2, 0.1mg/ml o-dianisidine, 3 units of horse
radish peroxidase, 0.5 units of L-amino acid oxidase and
0.75-8 mM substrate (Met-Ala-Ser or Met-Gly-MetMet). The activity of the enzyme was monitored in an
ELISA plate reader for 2-15 min. The values obtained
were corrected by subtracting the blank readings (no
significant difference was noticed when assays were carried out with all ingredients except either substrate or
protein) and μmol of product released was calculated by
using the extinction coefficient [35] of oxidised o-dianisidine as 10580 M-1cm.-1.
Western blotting

Purified proteins (1 μg protein/slot) were resolved in
12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (0.45 μm) using a mini-transblot apparatus (BioRad) for Western blotting. Membranes were stained
with Ponceau S to ensure transfer, processed using antiHis/anti-mouse IgG and detected through ECL detection system following manufacturer’s (GE Healthcare)
recommended protocol.
CD spectroscopy

CD spectra of MtMetAP1a and MtMetAP1c were
recorded in a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter before and
after thermal denaturation. Measurements in the farultraviolet region (190-250 nm) were performed on protein solutions (0.15-0.3 mg/ml in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5
and 150 mM/300 mM NaCl) employing a cell with path
length of 0.1 cm at 25°C. The protein samples were
heated at a rate of 3°C/min up to 50°C and the spectra
were recorded at 25°C and 50°C. For calculating T m ,
MtMetAP1a and MtMetAP1c were heated in the thermoelectric cell of the CD spectrophotometer at the
fixed rate of 1°C/min and the thermal denaturation
curves were recorded at 208 nm. Measurements in
near-ultraviolet region (250-350 nm) were carried out
using cell with path length of 1cm at 25°C on protein
solutions (0.3-0.5 mg/ml in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5 and
150 mM/300 mM NaCl). The mean residue ellipticity
[θ] was calculated using a mean residue molecular mass
of 110 Da. Each spectrum reported is an average of ten
scans. Blank spectra of aqueous buffer were used to correct the observed spectra.
Bioinformatic analysis

Nucleotide derived amino acid sequence of MtMetAP1c
was compared with non-redundant database using
BLAST [36]. The multiple sequence alignment of the
retrieved sequences was carried out using ClustalX [37]
with default values for gap opening and extension
penalties.

Molecular modelling

The crystal structure of MtMetAP1c (PDB ID: 1YJ3) [9]
served as the template for modeling of MtMetAP1a
using Modeller 9v7 program and model was selected on
the basis of DOPE score [38-40]. The PROCHECK validated model was energy minimised using LEap module
of AMBER 9 package [41,42]. Structures of different
mutants (V18G, P19G, and V18GP19G) were generated
using MtMetAP1c as the template and residue replacement editor in PYMOL. The structure of all the mutants
were also energy minimized.
Molecular dynamics simulations

All MD simulations were performed with AMBER 9.0
and FF03 forcefield [43]. The protein was embedded in
the TIP3P water box [44], which approximately
extended 10Å in each direction from the peripheral surface of the protein to any periodic box edge with unit
box dimensions of 18.774 × 18.774 × 18.774 Å. Periodic
boundary conditions were applied and the entire system
(solvent with protein) was energy minimized. Initial
equilibration was monitored for 1 ns and the production
MD simulation was then run at 300K, maintained using
Langevin weak coupling algorithm [45]. The simulation
trajectory was calculated using heavy atom harmonic
position SHAKE [46]. Simulation was continued till 50
ns with an integration step of 2 fs and snapshots were
retained every 10 ps for further analysis. MD trajectories
were analyzed using the PTRAJ module and structures
were visualized using VMD molecular visualization program [47].
Data analysis

Unless mentioned otherwise, reproducibility of each
experiment throughout this study was checked at least
three times and results were calculated as Mean ± SD.
