Abstract
Background: Comparative genomics has revealed extensive horizontal gene transfer among
prokaryotes, a development that is often considered to undermine the ‘tree of life’ concept.
However, the possibility remains that a statistical central trend still exists in the phylogenetic
‘forest of life’.
Results: A comprehensive comparative analysis of a ‘forest’ of 6,901 phylogenetic trees for
prokaryotic genes revealed a consistent phylogenetic signal, particularly among 102 nearly
universal trees, despite high levels of topological inconsistency, probably due to horizontal
gene transfer. Horizontal transfers seemed to be distributed randomly and did not obscure
the central trend. The nearly universal trees were topologically similar to numerous other
trees. Thus, the nearly universal trees might reflect a significant central tendency, although
they cannot represent the forest completely. However, topological consistency was seen
mostly at shallow tree depths and abruptly dropped at the level of the radiation of archaeal
and bacterial phyla, suggesting that early phases of evolution could be non-tree-like (Biological
Big Bang). Simulations of evolution under compressed cladogenesis or Biological Big Bang
yielded a better fit to the observed dependence between tree inconsistency and phylogenetic
depth for the compressed cladogenesis model.
Conclusions: Horizontal gene transfer is pervasive among prokaryotes: very few gene trees
are fully consistent, making the original tree of life concept obsolete. A central trend that
most probably represents vertical inheritance is discernible throughout the evolution of
archaea and bacteria, although compressed cladogenesis complicates unambiguous resolution
of the relationships between the major archaeal and bacterial clades.

Background
The tree of life is, probably, the single dominating metaphor that permeates the discourse of evolutionary biology,

from the famous single illustration in Darwin’s On the
Origin of Species [1] to 21st-century textbooks. For about a
century, from the publication of the Origin to the founding

work in molecular evolution carried out by Zuckerkandl
and Pauling in the early 1960s [2,3], phylogenetic trees
were constructed on the basis of phenotypic differences
between organisms. Accordingly, every tree constructed
during that century was an ‘organismal’ or ‘species’ tree by
definition; that is, it was assumed to reflect the evolutionary
history of the corresponding species. Zuckerkandl and
Pauling introduced molecular phylogeny, but for the next
two decades or so it was viewed simply as another, perhaps
most powerful, approach to the construction of species trees
and, ultimately, the tree of life that would embody the
evolutionary relationships between all lineages of cellular
life forms. The introduction of rRNA as the molecule of
choice for the reconstruction of the phylogeny of
prokaryotes by Woese and co-workers [4,5], which was
accompanied by the discovery of a new domain of life - the
Archaea - boosted hopes that the detailed, definitive topology of the tree of life could be within sight.
Even before the advent of extensive genomic sequencing, it
had become clear that biologically important common
genes of prokaryotes had experienced multiple horizontal
gene transfers (HGTs), so the idea of a ‘net of life’
potentially replacing the tree of life was introduced [6,7].
Advances in comparative genomics revealed that different
genes very often had distinct tree topologies and, accordingly,
that HGT seemed to be extremely common among prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) [8-17], and could also have
been important in the evolution of eukaryotes, especially as
a consequence of endosymbiotic events [18-21]. These
findings indicate that a true, perfect tree of life does not
exist because HGT prevents any single gene tree from being
an accurate representation of the evolution of entire
genomes. The nearly universal realization that HGT among
prokaryotes is common and extensive, rather than rare and
inconsequential, led to the idea of ‘uprooting’ the tree of
life, a development that is often viewed as a paradigm shift
in evolutionary biology [11,22,23].
Of course, no amount of inconsistency between gene phylogenies caused by HGT or other processes can alter the fact
that all cellular life forms are linked by a tree of cell
divisions (Omnis cellula e cellula, quoting the famous motto
of Rudolf Virchow - paradoxically, an anti-evolutionist [24])
that goes back to the earliest stages of evolution and is only
violated by endosymbiotic events that were key to the
evolution of eukaryotes but not prokaryotes [25]. Thus, the
travails of the tree of life concept in the era of comparative
genomics concern the tree as it can be derived by the phylogenetic (phylogenomic) analysis of genes and genomes. The
claim that HGT uproots the tree of life more accurately has
to be read to mean that extensive HGT has the potential to
result in the complete decoupling of molecular phylogenies

http://jbiol.com/content/8/6/59

from the actual tree of cells. It should be kept in mind that
the evolutionary history of genes also describes the evolution of the encoded molecular functions, so the phylogenomic analyses have clear biological connotations. In this
article we discuss the phylogenomic tree of life with this
implicit understanding.
The views of evolutionary biologists on the changing status
of the tree of life (see [23] for a conceptual discussion) span
the entire range from persistent denial of the major
importance of HGT for evolutionary biology [26,27]; to
‘moderate’ overhaul of the tree of life concept [28-33]; to
radical uprooting whereby the representation of the evolution of organisms (or genomes) as a tree of life is declared
meaningless [34-36]. The moderate approach maintains
that all the differences between individual gene trees
notwithstanding, the tree of life concept still makes sense as
a representation of a central trend (consensus) that, at least
in principle, could be elucidated by comprehensive comparison of tree topologies. The radical view counters that
the reality of massive HGT renders illusory the very distinction between the vertical and horizontal transmission of
genetic information, so that the tree of life concept should
be abandoned altogether in favor of a (broadly defined)
network representation of evolution [17]. Perhaps the tree
of life conundrum is epitomized in the recent debate on the
tree that was generated from a concatenation of alignments
of 31 highly conserved proteins and touted as an automatically constructed, highly resolved tree of life [37], only
to be dismissed with the label of a ‘tree of one percent’ (of
the genes in any given genome) [38].
Here we report an exhaustive comparison of approximately
7,000 phylogenetic trees for individual genes that collectively comprise the ‘forest of life’ and show that this set of
trees does gravitate to a single tree topology, but that the
deep splits in this topology cannot be unambiguously
resolved, probably due to both extensive HGT and
methodological problems of tree reconstruction. Nevertheless, computer simulations indicate that the observed pattern
of evolution of archaea and bacteria better corresponds to a
compressed cladogenesis model [39,40] than to a ‘Big Bang’
model that includes non-tree-like phases of evolution [36].
Together, these findings seem to be compatible with the
‘tree of life as a central trend’ concept.

Results and discussion
The forest of life: finding paths in the thicket
Altogether, we analyzed 6,901 maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees that were built for clusters of orthologous groups
of proteins (COGs) from the COG [41,42] and EggNOG [43]
databases that included a selected, representative set of 100

prokaryotes (41 archaea and 59 bacteria; Additional data
files 1 and 2). The majority of these trees include only a
small number of species (less than 20): the distribution of
the number of species in trees shows an exponential decay,
with only 2,040 trees including more than 20 species
(Figure 1). We attempted to identify patterns in this collection of trees (forest of life) and, in particular, to address the
question whether or not there exists a central trend among
the trees that, perhaps, could be considered an approximation of a tree of life. The principal object of this analysis
was a complete, all-against-all matrix of the topological
distances between the trees (see Materials and methods for
details). This matrix was represented as a network of trees
and was also subject to classical multidimensional scaling
(CMDS) analysis aimed at the detection of distinct clusters
of trees. We further introduced the inconsistency score (IS),
a measure of how representative the topology of the given
tree is of the entire forest of life (the IS is the fraction of the
times the splits from a given tree are found in all trees of the
forest). The key aspect of the tree analysis using the IS is that
we objectively examine trends in the forest of life, without
relying on the topology of a preselected ‘species tree’ such as
a supertree used in the most comprehensive previous study
of HGT [31] or a tree of concatenated highly conserved
proteins or rRNAs [17,37,44].
In general, trees consist of different sets of species, mostly
small numbers (Figure 1), so the comparison of the tree
topologies involves a pruning step where the trees are
reduced to the overlap in the species sets; in many cases, the
species sets do not overlap, so the distance between the
corresponding trees cannot be calculated (see Materials and
methods). To avoid the uncertainty associated with the
pruning procedure and to explore the properties of those

few trees that could be considered to represent the ‘core of
life’, we analyzed, along with the complete set of trees, a
subset of nearly universal trees (NUTs). As the strictly universal gene core of cellular life is very small and continues
to shrink (owing to the loss of generally ‘essential’ genes in
some organisms with small genomes, and to errors of
genome annotation) [45,46], we defined NUTs as trees for
those COGs that were represented in more than 90% of the
included prokaryotes; this definition yielded 102 NUTs. Not
surprisingly, the great majority of the NUTs are genes
encoding proteins involved in translation and the core
aspects of transcription (Additional data file 3). For most of
the analyses described below, we analyzed the NUTs in
parallel with the complete set of trees in the forest of life or
else traced the position of the NUTs in the results of the
global analysis; however, this approach does not amount to
using the NUTs as an a priori standard against which to
compare the rest of the trees.

The NUTs contain a strong, consistent phylogenetic signal,
with independent HGT events
We begin the systematic exploration of the forest of life with
the grove of 102 NUTs. Figure 2a shows the network of
connections between the NUTs on the basis of topological
similarity. The results of this analysis indicated that the
topologies of the NUTs were, in general, highly coherent,
with a nearly full connectivity reached at 50% similarity
((1 - BSD) × 100) cutoff (BSD is boot split distance; see
Materials and methods for details; Figure 2b).
In 56% of the NUTs, archaea and bacteria were perfectly
separated, whereas the remaining 44% showed indications
of HGT between archaea and bacteria (13% from archaea to
bacteria, 23% from bacteria to archaea and 8% in both
directions; see Materials and methods for details and
Additional data file 3). In the rest of the NUTs, there was no
sign of such interdomain gene transfer but there were many
probable HGT events within one or both domains (data not
shown).
The inconsistency among the NUTs ranged from 1.4 to
4.3%, whereas the mean value of inconsistency for an
equal-sized set (102) of randomly generated trees with the
same number of species was approximately 80%
(Figure 3), indicating that the topologies of the NUTs are
highly consistent and non-random. We explored the
relationships among the 102 NUTs by embedding them
into a 30-dimensional tree space using the CMDS procedure [47,48] (see Materials and methods for details). The
gap statistics analysis [49] reveals a lack of significant
clustering among the NUTs in the tree space. Thus, all the
NUTs seem to belong to a single, unstructured cloud of
points scattered around a single centroid (Figure 4a). This

organization of the tree space is most compatible with
individual trees randomly deviating from a single,
dominant topology (the tree of life), apparently as a result
of HGT (but possibly also due to random errors in the treeconstruction procedure). To further assess the potential
contribution of phylogenetic analysis artifacts to observed
inconsistencies between the NUTs, we carried out a
comparative analysis of these trees with different bootstrap
support thresholds (that is, only splits supported by
bootstrap values above the respective threshold value were
compared). As shown in Figure 3, particularly low IS levels
were detected for splits with high-bootstrap support, but
the inconsistency was never eliminated completely, suggesting that HGT is a significant contributor to the observed
inconsistency among the NUTs.

was used for tree construction (see Materials and methods
for details). However, 14 NUTs corresponded to COGs
consisting strictly of 1:1 orthologs (all of them ribosomal
proteins). These 1:1 NUTs were similar to others in terms of
connectivity in the networks of trees, although their
characteristic connectivity was somewhat greater than that
of the rest of the NUTs (Figure 2b) or their positions in the
single cluster of NUTs obtained using CMDS (Figure 4a),
indicating that the selection of conserved paralogs for tree
analysis in the other NUTs did not substantially affect the
results of topology comparison.

The NUTs include highly conserved genes whose phylogenies
have been extensively studied previously. It is not our aim
here to compare these phylogenies in detail and to discuss
the implications of particular tree topologies. Nevertheless,
it is worth noting, by way of a reality check, that the
putative HGT events between archaea and bacteria detected
here by the separation score analysis (see Materials and
methods for details) are compatible with previous observations (Additional data file 3). In particular, HGT was inferred
for 83% of the genes encoding aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases
(compared with the overall 44%), essential components of

The table shows the mean split distance ± standard deviation for the three sets of NUTs and the ‘universal tree of life’ (TOL) [37]. The overlap
between the tree of life and the NUTs consisted of 47 species, so the distances were computed after pruning the NUTs to that set of species.

the translation machinery that are known for their horizontal
mobility [50,51], whereas no HGT was predicted for any of
the ribosomal proteins, which belong to an elaborate
molecular complex, the ribosome, and hence appear to be
non-exchangeable between the two prokaryotic domains
[52,53]. In addition to the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, and
in agreement with many previous observations ([54] and
references therein), evidence of HGT between archaea and
bacteria was seen also for the majority of the metabolic
enzymes that belonged to the NUTs, including undecaprenyl
pyrophosphate synthase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, nucleoside diphosphate kinase, thymidylate
kinase, and others (Additional data file 3).
Most of the NUTs, as well as the supertree, also showed a
good topological agreement with trees produced by
analysis of concatenations of universal proteins [37,55];
notably, the mean distance from the NUTs to the tree of 31
concatenated (nearly) universal proteins [37] was very
similar to the mean distance among the 102 NUTs and that
between the full set of NUTs and the 14 1:1 NUTs
(Table 1). In other words, the ‘Universal Tree of Life’
constructed by Ciccarelli et al. [37] was statistically
indistinguishable from the NUTs but did show obvious
properties of a consensus topology (the 1:1 ribosomal
protein NUTs were more similar to the universal tree than
the rest of the NUTs, in part because these proteins were
used for the construction of the universal tree and, in part,
presumably because of the low level of HGT among
ribosomal proteins).
The overall conclusion on the evolutionary trends among
the NUTs is unequivocal. Although the topologies of the
NUTs were, for the most part, not identical, so that the
NUTs could be separated by their degree of inconsistency (a
proxy for the amount of HGT), the overall high consistency
level indicated that the NUTs are scattered in the close
vicinity of a consensus tree, with the HGT events distributed
randomly, at least approximately. Examination of a

supernetwork built from the 102 NUTs suggests that the
incongruence among these trees is mainly concentrated at
the deepest levels (except for the clean archaeal-bacterial
split), with a much greater congruence at shallow phylogenetic depths (Figure 5). Of course, one should keep in
mind that the unequivocal separation of archaea and bacteria in the supernetwork is obtained despite the apparent
substantial interdomain HGT (in around 44% of the NUTs;
see above), with the implication that HGT is likely to be
even more common between the major branches within the
archaeal and bacterial domains. These results are congruent
with previous reports on the apparently random distribution of HGT events in the history of highly conserved
genes, in particular those encoding proteins involved in
translation [29,53], and on the difficulty of resolving the
phylogenetic relationships between the major branches of
bacteria [28,56,57] and archaea [58,59].

The NUTs versus the forest of life
We analyzed the structure of the forest of life by embedding
the 3,789 COG trees into a 669-dimensional space (see
Materials and methods for details) using the CMDS procedure [47,48] (a CMDS analysis of the entire set of 6,901
trees in the forest was beyond the capacity of the R software
package used for this analysis; however, the set of COG trees
included most of the trees with a large number of species for
which the topology comparison is most informative). A gap
statistics analysis [49] of K-means clustering of these trees in
the tree space did reveal distinct clusters of trees in the
forest. The partitioning of the forest into seven clusters of
trees (the smallest number of clusters for which the gap
function did not significantly increase with the increase of
the number of clusters; Figure 4b) produces groups of trees
that differed in terms of the distribution of the trees by the
number of species, the partitioning of archaea-only and
bacteria-only trees, and the functional classification of the
respective COGs (Figure 4c,d). For instance, clusters 1, 4, 5
and 6 were enriched for bacterial-only trees, all archaealonly trees belong to clusters 2 and 3, and cluster 7 consists

entirely of mixed archaeal-bacterial clusters; notably, all the
NUTs form a compact group inside cluster 6 (Figure 4b).
The results of the CMDS clustering support the existence of
several distinct ‘attractors’ in the forest; however, we have to
emphasize caution in the interpretation of this clustering
because trivial separation of the trees by size could be an
important contribution. The approaches to the delineation
of distinct ‘groves’ within the forest merit further investigation. The most salient observation for the purpose of the
present study is that all the NUTs occupy a compact and
contiguous region of the tree space and, unlike the complete

set of the trees, are not partitioned into distinct clusters by
the CMDS procedure (Figure 4a).
Not unexpectedly, the trees in the forest show a strong
signal of numerous HGT events, including interdomain
gene transfers. Specifically, in the group of 1,473 trees that

bacterial species, perfect separation of archaea and bacteria
was seen in only 13%. This value is the low bound of the
fraction of trees that are free of interdomain HGT because,
even when archaea and bacteria are perfectly separated, such

NUT

Figure 6
Distribution of the trees in the forest of life by topological inconsistency. (a) All trees. (b) Trees partitioned into COG functional categories. The
data for the NUTs are also shown. The IS values are classified as very low (VL; values less than 40% of mean IS), low (L; values less than 20% of mean
IS), medium (M; values around mean IS ± 20%), high (H; more than 20% of mean IS), and very high (VH; values more than 40% of mean IS).

HGT cannot be ruled out, for instance, in cases when a
small, compact archaeal branch is embedded within a
bacterial lineage (or vice versa). We further explored the
distribution of ISs among the trees. Rather unexpectedly,
the majority of the trees (about 70%) had either a very high
or a very low level of inconsistency, suggestive of a bimodal
distribution of the level of HGT (Figure 6a). Furthermore,
the distribution of the ISs across functional classes of genes
was distinctly non-random: some categories, in particular,
all those related to transcription and translation, but also
some classes of metabolic enzymes, were strongly enriched
in trees with very low ISs, whereas others, such as genes for
enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism or proteins involved
in inorganic ion transport, were characterized by very high
inconsistency (Figure 6b). The great majority of the NUTs
that include, primarily, genes for proteins involved in
translation have very low ISs (Figure 6b). These observations, in part, overlap with the predictions of the wellknown complexity hypothesis [52], according to which the
rate of HGT is low for those genes that encode subunits of
large macromolecular complexes, such as the ribosome, and
much higher for those genes whose products do not form
such complexes. However, some of the findings reported

here, such as the very low inconsistency values among genes
for enzymes of nucleotide and coenzyme biosynthesis, do
not readily fit the framework of the complexity hypothesis.
We constructed a network of all 6,901 trees that collectively
comprise the forest and examined the position and the
connectivity of the 102 NUTs in this network (Figure 7). At
the 50% similarity cutoff and a P-value <0.05, the 102 NUTs
were connected to 2,615 trees (38% of all trees in the forest;
Figure 7), and the mean similarity of the trees to the NUTs
was approximately 50%, with similar distributions of
strongly, moderately and weakly similar trees seen for most
of the NUTs (Figure 8a). In sharp contrast, using the same
similarity cutoff, 102 randomized NUTs were connected to
only 33 trees (about 0.5% of the trees) and the mean
similarity to the trees in the forest was approximately 28%.
Accordingly, the random trees showed completely different
distributions of similarity to the trees in the forest, with the
consistent predominance of moderately and weakly similar
trees (Figure 8b). These findings emphasize the highly nonrandom topological similarity between the NUTs and a
large part of the forest of life, and show that this similarity is
not an artifact of the large number of species in the NUTs.

significantly differ from the random values at greater depths
(Figure 9b). The only deep signal that was apparent within
the entire forest was seen at depth 40 and corresponded to
the split between archaea and bacteria (Figure 9b); when
only the NUTs were similarly analyzed, an additional signal
was seen at depth 12, which corresponds to the separation
between Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota (Figure 9c).
These findings indicate that most of the edges that support
the network of trees are based on the congruence of the
topologies in the crowns of trees whereas the deep splits are,
mostly, inconsistent. Together with a previous report that
the congruence between phylogenetic trees of conserved
prokaryotic proteins at deep levels is no greater than
random [57], these findings cast doubt on the feasibility of
identification of a central trend in the forest that could
qualify as a tree of life.

NUTs

Testing the Biological Big Bang model

Figure 7
Network representation of the 6,901 trees of the forest of life. The 102
NUTs are shown as red circles in the middle. The NUTs are connected
to trees with similar topologies: trees with at least 50% of similarity with
at least one NUT (P-value <0.05) are shown as purple circles and
connected to the NUTs. The rest of the trees are shown as green circles.

A comparison between the NUTs and the seven clusters
revealed by the CMDS analysis also showed comparable
average levels of similarity (close to 50%) to each of the
clusters (Figure 4e). Considering this relatively high and
uniform level of connectivity between the NUTs and the rest
of the trees in the forest, and the lack of a pronounced
structure within the set of the NUTs themselves (see above),
it appears that the NUTs potentially could be a reasonable
representation of a central trend in the forest of life, despite
the apparent existence of distinct ‘groves’ and the high
prevalence of HGT.

The dependence of tree inconsistency on the phylogenetic
depth
An important issue that could potentially affect the status of
the NUTs as a representation of a central trend in the forest
of life is the dependence of the inconsistency between trees
on the phylogenetic depth. As suggested by the structure of
the supernetwork of the NUTs (Figure 4), the inconsistency
of the trees notably increased with phylogenetic depth. We
examined this problem quantitatively by tallying the IS
values separately for each depth (the split depth that was
determined by counting splits from the leaves to the center
of the tree; see Materials and methods; Figure 9a) and found
that the inconsistency of the forest was substantially lower
than that of random trees at the top levels but did not

The sharply increasing inconsistency at the deep levels of
the forest of life suggests the possibility that the evolutionary processes that were responsible for the formation of
this part of the forest could be much different from those
that were in operation at lesser phylogenetic depths. More
specifically, we considered two models of early evolution at
the level of archaeal and bacterial phyla: a compressed
cladogenesis (CC) model, whereby there is a tree structure
even at the deepest levels but the internal branches are
extremely short [39]; and a Biological Big Bang (BBB)
model under which the early phase of evolution involved
horizontal gene exchange so intensive that there is no signal
of vertical inheritance in principle [36].
We simulated the evolutionary processes that produced the
forest of life under each of these models. To this end, it was
necessary to represent the phylogenetic depth as a continuous value that would be comparable between different
branches (as opposed to the discrete levels unique for each
tree that were used to generate the plots in Figure 9). This
task was achieved using an ultrametric tree that was
produced from the supertree of the 102 NUTs (see Materials
and methods; Figure 10). The inconsistency of the forest of
life sharply increases, in a phase-transition-like fashion,
between the depths of 0.7 and 0.8 (Figure 10). We attempted to fit this empirically observed curve with the respective
curves produced by simulating the BBB at different
phylogenetic depths by randomly shuffling the tree
branches at the given depth and modeling the subsequent
evolution as a tree-like process with different numbers of
HGT events. The results indicate that only by simulating the
BBB at the depth of 0.8 could a good fit with the empirical
curve be reached (Figures 11c and 12). This depth is below
the divergence of the major bacterial and archaeal phyla
(Figure 10). Simulation of the BBB at the critical depth of

0.7 or above (completely erasing the phylogenetic signal
below the phylum level) did not yield a satisfactory fit
(Figures 11a,b and 12), suggesting that the CC model is a
more appropriate representation of the early phases of
evolution of archaea and bacteria than the BBB model. In
other words, the signal of vertical inheritance (a central
trend in the forest of life) is detectable even at these phylogenetic depths, although given the high level of inconsistency, the determination of the correct tree topology of the
deepest branches in the tree is problematic at best. The
results of this analysis do not rule out the BBB model as the
generative mechanism underlying the divergence of archaea
and bacteria, but this scenario cannot be tested in the
manner described above because of the absence of an outgroup. Effectively, simulation of a BBB at a depth of 0.8 or
greater is meaningless within the context of the present
analysis or any imaginable further analysis, because the
archaea and bacteria are thought to be the primary lineages
in the evolution of life on Earth.

Finally, when we compared the dependence of the
inconsistency on phylogenetic depth for the 102 NUTs and
the complete FOL, the NUTs showed a comparable level of
inconsistency at low depths but did not display the sharp
transition at greater depths, so that below the transition (the
CC phase of evolution) seen in the forest of life, the
inconsistency of the NUTs was approximately tenfold lower
(Figure 13). These results emphasize the relatively strong
(compared to the rest of the trees in the forest) vertical
signal that is present in the NUTs throughout the entire
range of phylogenetic depths.

Conclusions
Recent developments in prokaryotic genomics reveal the
omnipresence of HGT in the prokaryotic world and are
often considered to undermine the tree of life concept uprooting the tree of life [9,11,22,35,60]. There is no doubt
that the now well-established observations that HGT spares

virtually no genes at some stages in their history [15,16]
overthrow a ‘strong’ tree of life concept under which all (or
the substantial majority) of the genes would tell a consistent
story of genome evolution (the species tree, or the tree of life)
if analyzed using appropriate methods. However, is there any
hope of salvaging the tree of life as a statistical central trend
[28]? The results of a comprehensive comparative analysis of
phylogenetic trees for prokaryotic genes described here
suggest a positive answer to this crucial question.
The message from this analysis is twofold. On the one hand,
we detected high levels of inconsistency among the trees
comprising the forest of life, most probably due to extensive
HGT, a conclusion that is supported by more direct observations of numerous probable transfers of genes between

archaea and bacteria. On the other hand, we detected a
distinct signal of a consensus topology that was particularly
strong in the NUTs. Although the NUTs showed a substantial amount of apparent HGT, the transfer events seemed to
be distributed randomly and did not obscure the vertical
signal. Moreover, the topology of the NUTs was quite similar to those of numerous other trees in the forest, so
although the NUTs certainly cannot represent the forest
completely, this set of largely consistent, nearly universal
trees is a reasonable candidate for representing a central
trend. However, the opposite side of the coin is that the
consistency between the trees in the forest is high at shallow
depths of the trees and abruptly drops, almost down to the
level of random trees, at greater phylogenetic depths that
correspond to the radiation of archaeal and bacterial phyla.

Phylogenetic depth

Figure 10
Ultrametric tree produced from the supertree of the 102 NUTs (left) and the dependence of mean inconsistency on phylogenetic depth in this tree
(right). The inconsistency versus depth plot is for all 6,901 trees in the forest of life. Species abbreviations as in Figure 5.

This observation casts doubt on the existence of a central
trend in the forest of life and suggests the possibility that the
early phases of evolution might have been non-tree-like (a
Biological Big Bang [36]). To address this problem directly,
we simulated evolution under the CC model [39,40] and
under the BBB model, and found that the CC scenario
better approximates the observed dependence between tree
inconsistency and phylogenetic depth. Thus, a consistent
phylogenetic signal seems to be discernible throughout the
evolution of archaea and bacteria but, under the CC model,
the prospect of unequivocally resolving the relationships
between the major archaeal and bacterial clades is bleak.
The most straightforward interpretation of the detected
central trend in the forest of life is that it represents vertical
inheritance permeating the entire history of archaea and
bacteria. A contribution from ‘highways’ of HGT (that is,
preferential HGT between certain groups of archaea and
bacteria) that could mimic vertical evolution [15] cannot be
ruled out. However, in our view, the lack of significant
clustering within the group of NUTs and the comparable

high levels of similarity between the NUTs and different
clusters of trees in the forest suggest that the trend, even if
relatively weak, is primarily vertical.
In summary, HGT is pervasive in the prokaryotic world, so
that there are very few fully consistent NUTs. Thus, the
original tree of life concept is obsolete: it would not even be
a ‘tree of one percent’ [38]. Nevertheless, there seems to be a
discernible signal of consistency between the trees in the
forest of life, down to the deepest branching levels. Whether
or not this central trend is denoted a tree of life could be a
matter of convention and convenience, but the nature of
this trend as well as the other trends that can be discerned
in the forest merit further investigation.

Clusters of orthologous genes for phylogenetic tree analysis

59 bacteria and 41 archaea - that were manually selected to
represent all the major divisions of the two prokaryotic
domains (Additional data file 1). The BeTs algorithm [41]
was used to identify the orthologs with the highest mean
similarity to the other members of a cluster (‘index’ orthologs [61]), so that each of the final clusters contained a
maximum of 100 sequences (no more than one from each
of the included organisms). The rationale behind the
selection of index orthologs for phylogenetic analysis is that
this procedure identifies the members of co-orthologous
gene sets that experienced minimal (if any) acceleration of
evolution as a result of gene duplication, and accordingly
minimizes the potential long-branch artifacts. A group of
102 COGs that were represented in more than 90 organisms
was defined as the subset of NUTs (Additional data file 3).
Finally, 12 COGs containing more than 300 sequences each
were excluded from the subsequent analysis.

Protein sequence alignment and tree construction
The protein sequences from each COG were aligned using
the Muscle program [62] with default parameters and all
alignments were refined using the Gblocks program [63]
with the minimal length of a block set at six amino acid

positions, and the maximum number of allowed
contiguous non-conserved amino acid positions set at 20.
The maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were constructed under the best substitution model using the Multiphyl
program, which was also used for bootstrap analysis [64].
The Multiphyl program employs methods from the
ModelGenerator program to choose, for each alignment, the
best of 88 models of amino acid substitution [65]. The
entire set of 6,901 trees used in this study is contained in
Additional data file 2, and all alignments used for the tree
construction are available at [66].

Supernetwork construction and analysis
The phylogenetic supernetwork from the 102 NUTs was built
following the method developed by Huson et al. [67] and
implemented in the SplitsTree4 program [68] with default
parameters. The supernetwork was used for an initial
overview of the 102 NUTs set to identify signals and
incongruence at different phylogenetic depths. The signals
identified by the examination of the supernetwork were
verified by the comparative analysis of the tree topologies and
by the calculation of the IS against the phylogenetic depth.

Ultrametric tree
The topology of the ultrametric tree was obtained from the
supertree of the 102 NUTs using the CLANN program [69].
The branch lengths from each of the 6,901 trees was used to
calculate the average distance between each pair of species.
The matrix obtained was used to calculate the branch
lengths of the supertree. This supertree with branch lengths
was then used to construct an ultrametric tree using the
program KITSCH from the Phylip package [70] and rescaled

of all splits, x is the mean bootstrap value of equal splits,
and y is the mean bootstrap value of different splits.

Tree comparison

The pairwise comparison was made for trees with leaf sets
that either completely or partially overlap. If trees partially
overlap in at least four species, they are pruned to their
common leaf set in order to compare the topologies. If two
trees cannot be compared because they overlap by fewer
than four species, a maximum BSD of 1 was assigned.

An all-against-all comparison of the trees was performed
using a new method that we denoted BSD. The BSD method
is a modification of the split distance (SD) method for tree
comparison [71] that additionally takes into account the
bootstrap values of the trees. Both indices range from 0 to 1
but the SD method assigns equal weights to all branches in
a tree, whereas under the BSD method the distance between
two trees depends on the level of bootstrap support for the
branches of each tree. The BSD corresponds to the average
[BSD = (eBSD + dBSD)/2] of the BSD of equal splits between two trees (eBSD = 1 - [(e/a)·x]) and the BSD of the
different splits (dBSD =(d/a)·y). Here e is the sum of
bootstrap values of equal splits, d is the sum of bootstrap
values of different splits, a is the sum of the bootstrap values

CMDS, also known as principal coordinate analysis,
embeds n data points implied by a [n × n] distance matrix
into an m-dimensional space (m < n) in such a manner that,
for any k ∈ [1,m], the embedding into the first k dimensions
is the best in terms of preserving the original distances
between the points [47,48]. Given that in this work the
relationships between phylogenetic trees are defined in
terms of tree-to-tree distance, CMDS is the natural approach
to analyze the structure of the tree space. The function
cmdscale of the R package was used to perform CMDS on
BSD distances between the trees. The number of dimensions
corresponding to preserving 75% of the total inertia

(30 dimensions for 102 NUTs and 669 dimensions for
3,789 COG trees) was chosen for further analysis.
Clustering of data points in multidimensional space was
performed using the kmeans function of the R package that
implements the K-means algorithm [72]. The choice of the
optimal number of clusters was performed using an R script
implementing the gap statistics algorithm [49]. In the case
of the 102 NUTs, the highest value of the gap function was
observed at K = 1, for K ∈ [1,30], indicating a single cluster
in the tree space. In the case of the 3,789 COG trees, the gap
function was increasing for K ∈ [1,30], suggesting a strong
tendency of these trees to form multiple clusters. Following
the recommendations of Tibshirani et al. [49], K = 7 was
chosen as the lowest number of clusters for which the value
of the gap function for K = k + 1 was not significantly higher
than that for K = k (z-score below 1.96, corresponding to
0.05 significance level).

Inference of horizontal gene transfer
To analyze all possible cases of HGT between bacteria and
archaea in the NUTs, we used the score of separation B/A
(SSB/A) that was calculated, for each branch in a tree, by
subtracting the number of bacteria or archaea on one side
of the tree from the number of bacteria or archaea on the
other side (SSB/A= ⏐pAleft-pAright⏐ = ⏐pBleft-pBright⏐) where
pA and pB are the percentages of archaeal and bacterial
species, respectively. The tree was assigned the highest
value of the separation score obtained for all its branches.
This score was also used to analyze possible cases of HGT
between bacteria and archaea in those trees that include
at least five archaeal species and at least five bacterial
species.
The value of the B/A score ranges from 0 to 1. A tree is
considered free of archaeal-bacterial HGT if the B/A score
equals 1, that is, archaea and bacteria are perfectly separated
in the given tree. The B/A score values of less than 1 are
considered indicative of HGT. These cases can be classified
into three categories: first, HGT from bacteria to archaea
(B → A) when there is a nearly perfect separation of these
two groups but inside the bacteria there is a small group of
archaeal species; second, HGT from archaea to bacteria
(A → B) when there is a small group of bacterial species
inside the archaeal domain; and third, bidirectional HGT
events (A ↔ B) when the greatest score of separation B/A is
obtained by mixing archaeal and bacterial species (pAleft,
pAright, pBleft and pBright <100%).

given tree, and Y is the number of times the splits from the
given tree are found in all trees of the forest. Under this
formula, ISmin = 1/(XN) and ISmax = [1/(X)] - ISmin. Thus, IS
is a measure of how representative the topology of the given
tree is of the entire forest of life.

Split depth and phylogenetic depth
The IS was calculated along the depth of the trees, namely,
split depth and phylogenetic depth. The split depth was
calculated for each phylogenetic tree according to the
number of splits from the tips to the center of the tree. The
value of split depth ranged from 1 (2 species - 1) to 49
((100 species/2) - 1). The phylogenetic depth was obtained
from the branch lengths of the rescaled ultrametric tree and
ranged from 0 to 1.

Simulation of Biological Big Bang and HGT
The simulation of a BBB was performed by cutting the
ultrametric tree at different levels of depth (D0) and
reassembling the bottom part of the tree to simulate
infinite numbers of HGT events. The BBB simulation was
made at D0 = 0.6, D0 = 0.7 and D0 = 0.8, and repeated 100
times each. The different levels of depth simulated are D0
= 0.6, corresponding to the depth just after the
hypothetical BBB, that is, in the hypothetical tree-like
phase; D0 = 0.7, which corresponds to the hypothetical
BBB; and D0 = 0.8, which corresponds to the hypothetical
biological inflation phase. Each tree obtained after the
simulation of the BBB was processed to simulate an
increasing number of HGT events from 1 to 200. These
HGT simulations were performed by cutting the tree at
random depth DR (DR < D0) and swapping a random pair
of branches.
