Abstract
Background: Staphylococcus aureus is associated with a spectrum of symbiotic relationships with its human host
from carriage to sepsis and is frequently associated with nosocomial and community-acquired infections, thus the
differential gene content among strains is of interest.
Results: We sequenced three clinical strains and combined these data with 13 publically available human isolates
and one bovine strain for comparative genomic analyses. All genomes were annotated using RAST, and then their
gene similarities and differences were delineated. Gene clustering yielded 3,155 orthologous gene clusters, of
which 2,266 were core, 755 were distributed, and 134 were unique. Individual genomes contained between 2,524
and 2,648 genes. Gene-content comparisons among all possible S. aureus strain pairs (n = 136) revealed a mean
difference of 296 genes and a maximum difference of 476 genes. We developed a revised version of our finite
supragenome model to estimate the size of the S. aureus supragenome (3,221 genes, with 2,245 core genes), and
compared it with those of Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. There was excellent agreement
between RAST’s annotations and our CDS clustering procedure providing for high fidelity metabolomic subsystem
analyses to extend our comparative genomic characterization of these strains.
Conclusions: Using a multi-species comparative supragenomic analysis enabled by an improved version of our
finite supragenome model we provide data and an interpretation explaining the relatively larger core genome of S.
aureus compared to other opportunistic nasopharyngeal pathogens. In addition, we provide independent
validation for the efficiency and effectiveness of our orthologous gene clustering algorithm.

Background
Most strains of the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus are avirulent, antibiotic-sensitive commensals; however, over the past several decades there have
emerged a number of pandemic, virulent, antibioticresistant strains including methicillin-resistant (MRSA)
and vancomycin-resistant (VRSA) strains [1]. Although
many S. aureus infections originate in the community, it

is also the most common nosocomial bacterial infection
in U.S. healthcare institutions, accounting for more than
half a million hospital-acquired infections annually
which exact an enormous financial and healthcare
burden.
S. aureus can be detected in its primary reservoir in
the anterior nares on a regular basis in about 20% (and
intermittently in another 60%) of the human population
[2], leading to efforts for decolonization in healthcare
settings [3]. Some S. aureus strains have acquired any of
a large number of virulence factors, and can cause a
range of infections from mild to serious including

pimples, impetigo, boils, cellulitis, endocarditis, necrotizing fasciitis, osteomyelitis, pneumonia, septic arthritis,
septicemia, and toxic shock syndrome [4,5]. The widespread, long-term exposure of humans to S. aureus antigens from non-pathogenic strains may help explain why
the development of an effective vaccine against pathogenic strains of S. aureus is difficult [6]. As a result of
its ubiquity and its ability to acquire virulence and antibiotic-resistance factors it is now estimated that invasive
MRSA infections cause more deaths in the U.S. (18,650
vs. 17,011 in 2005) than HIV/AIDS [7-10]. S. aureus
infections of domestic livestock are also of concern, and
cause significant economic losses [11,12].
Our laboratory has developed the Distributed Genome
Hypothesis (DGH), a model for understanding intra-species gene content differences in bacterial pathogens,
especially those associated with chronic infections
[13-15]. The DGH states that pathogenic bacterial species use horizontal gene transfer to make available to
the genomes of individual strains a set of non-core distributed genes with varying population frequencies, and
with varying probabilities of contributing to the species’
population fitness. The observation that these distributed genes are present at significantly different frequencies in the population of a given pathogenic species,
combined with the fact that the total number of genes
available in the population is larger (often much larger)
than the number of genes in any one strain’s genome,
has led us to describe the set of genes available to a bacterial pathogenic species as a supragenome [16-18] in
preference to the synonymously used term pan-genome
[19]. The DGH views the combinatorial process of augmenting a set of core genes with a significant number of
non-core distributed genes in each strain’s genome as
an evolutionary strategy to maximize the species’ population fitness across a range of environmental conditions
(e.g., nutrient supply, competing microbial flora, host
innate and adaptive immune responses, and exposure to
antibiotics) and at rates that are significantly greater
than can be achieved through the vertical transmission
and exchange of alleles of a relatively fixed set of genes
[20].
Whole genome shotgun sequencing using 454 Life
Sciences’ next-generation pyrosequencing technology
has been used in our laboratory to obtain high-coverage
draft genomic DNA sequence datasets for large numbers
of strains of several human bacterial pathogens [21-23].
Using these data, a predictive finite supragenome model
of the DGH was developed, and has been used to
delineate the supragenomes of Haemophilus influenzae
[21] and Streptococcus pneumoniae [22], two species
that are naturally transformable. Here we extend our
research on the DGH in several respects: (i) by

Page 2 of 15

comparatively examining all of the genomes that were
available for S. aureus, a non-transformable species; (ii)
by making use of a newly available automated bacterial
genome annotation service (the RAST system) for the
annotation of these 17 genomes, a service that is based
on a set of well-curated biological subsystem annotations [24]; and (iii) by introducing a revised finite supragenome model that allows the estimates of the
population gene frequencies to vary during the maximization of the log-likelihood of the observed sample gene
frequency data [21]. We use the descriptive and predictive capabilities of our revised finite supragenome model
to delineate the S. aureus supragenome, compare it with
the supragenomes of Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and estimate the number of chromosomal genes that would be found with the
sequencing of additional S. aureus genomes.

Results
Bacterial genomic DNA sequences and the annotation
data for their protein-coding genes

Table 1 lists general information about the genomes of
the 17 S. aureus strains that were used for this supragenome analysis. The following points should be noted
about these DNA sequence datasets. First, only the bacterial chromosome DNA sequences from the 14 published S. aureus strains were used; the plasmid DNA
sequences available for 8 of these 14 strains were not
included in the analyses. Second, the 14 published S.
aureus strains examined included some genomes that
are known to be very similar (e.g., strains JH1 and JH9).
Third, 16/17 of the S. aureus strains whose genomes
were examined were of human origin with only one
being of livestock origin (RF122, isolated from a case of
bovine mastitis).
Automated bacterial genome annotation is the only
practical method to keep pace with the productivity of
modern DNA sequencing technologies [25] such as
those used in this study to obtain high-coverage (~20X)
draft genomic sequences for clinical S. aureus strains
(Table 1). We chose the RAST automated bacterial genome annotation system [24] because it is free of charge,
confidential, secure, handles compute-intensive bacterial
genome annotation jobs quickly, and allows users to
upload their own sequences, i.e., it does not just offer
annotations of publicly available bacterial genomic DNA
sequence datasets. Currently, as Table 2 shows, even
based on the rudimentary criterion of CDS counts, different automated bacterial genome annotation providers
can produce significantly different results from the same
genomic DNA sequence datasets (and it should be
noted that exact agreement in Table 2 for CDS counts
for a given genome typically indicates re-use of an NCBI

Figure 1 shows the results of a neighbor grouping analysis [23] performed using the distributed S. aureus
genes, a procedure that displays the relatedness of
strains based on a metric of identity by state (as
opposed to identity by descent) which overcomes the
problems associated with trying to do phylogenetic analyses on mosaic genomes resulting from horizontal gene
transfer. The edge weights shown in the graph represent
the fraction of the distributed genes in the supragenome
that is either present in both (or absent in both) of the
genomes represented by the vertices of the relevant
edge. The mean distance among all possible strains
pairs (n = 136) is 0.34 ± 0.01, and valid neighbor groups
are indicated (see Materials and Methods). This analysis
of distributed gene content helped determine the relationship of the three genomes that we sequenced with
the 14 published S. aureus genomes. The genome of the
strain CGSSa01 was very closely related to the genomes
of the community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) strains USA300 and USA300TCH15,
and the genome of the strain CGSSa03 was very closely
related to the genomes of the vancomycin-intermediate
S. aureus (VISA) strains JH1 and JH9.
Figure 2 summarizes the pair-wise relationships
between the genomes. The metrics used to describe
these relationships are: (i) the number of genes with
orthologs in each of the two strains (S = similarity
score); (ii) the number of genes with an ortholog in one

2010, vide infra)[26]. This single-linkage clustering procedure is designed to accommodate the use of draft
genomic DNA sequence data and its annotations, i.e.,
data that may include open reading frames that are disrupted by genome assembly errors, or genes interrupted
by contig breaks. This procedure yields clusters of CDS
orthologs based on 70% sequence identity over 70% of
the shorter sequence. Based on these clustering results,
genes were classified (Table 3) based on their frequency
as either unique (observed in one genome only), distributed (observed in more than one but not all genomes),
or core (present in all genomes).
The clustering results yielded 3,155 orthologous gene
clusters (genes), of which 2,266 were core, 755 were distributed and 134 were unique. The unique genes had an
uneven distribution, and it was not surprising that the
bovine isolate, RF122, had both the largest number of
unique genes (n = 53) and the smallest number of distributed genes (n = 205). Individual genomes contained
between 2,524 (RF122) and 2,648 (CGSSa01) genes,
whilst the maximum difference between any pair of S.
aureus genomes, out of all possible (17 choose 2 = 136)
pairs, based on protein-encoding gene content, was 476
genes. In addition, although only 13% of the total number of gene annotations among the 17 strains are noncore, 28% of the total number of genes found in these
17 strains are non-core indicating that many of these
genes are found repeatedly throughout the species

composite comparison score (C = S - D); and (iv) the
number of genes with orthologs found only in both
strains (P = pair unique score). The mean similarity and
difference scores calculated for all possible pairs (n =
136) produced values of 2,448 and 296 genes, respectively. These results and the occurrence of unique genes
(Table 3) are consistent with the known similarities
between the JH1 and JH9 genomes [27]; the Mu3 and
Mu50 genomes [28]; and the USA300 and
USA300TCH15 genomes [29]. These results are also
consistent with the expected outlier status of RF122
with respect to the strains of human origin. One interesting pair-wise relationship is that of MRSA252 and
CGSSa00; the comparison score was at its maximum for
MRSA252, whereas all other values for this score involving CGSSa00 were less than the mean, and in most
cases more than one standard deviation below the
mean. In addition, the maximum pair unique score for
all pair-wise relationships was that observed between
CGSSa00 and MRSA252, suggesting a highly significant
degree of relatedness.
Analyses of S. aureus population gene frequencies using
a revised finite supragenome model

To more accurately model the number of genes contained within a species’ supragenome we have revised
our finite supragenome model to take advantage of the
observed gene frequencies obtained from the sequencing
of limited numbers of target strains. Our model treats
each of the N genes in a bacterial species’ supragenome
as an independent Bernoulli random variable, with a

Page 5 of 15

gene’s occurrence in a genome of one of the strains of
the species representing a success outcome of a Bernoulli trial that has a probability equal to the gene’s
population frequency among all strains [21]. We model
the population gene frequencies for a species with a
supragenome as being limited to K classes, with each
class defined by two parameters: a Bernoulli probability
μk that represents the gene frequency, and a corresponding mixture coefficient πk that represents the probability
that one of the N genes in the supragenome belongs to
class k. Thus, in addition to N and K, our model
requires 2K additional parameters, which we denote
using the vectors μ and π. The K elements of the vector
π are constrained to be greater than zero and sum to
one. The K elements of μ are constrained to be greater
than zero, monotonically increasing with increasing k,
and that μK has a fixed value of one (for the core genes
in the supragenome). Our observed sample data from
the |S| genomes under study (17 here) is represented by
a vector C = {c0 , c1, c2, ..., c|S|} whose elements equal
the number of genes observed in exactly n = 0, 1, 2, ..., |
S| of these genomes. A constrained nonlinear programming function (fmincon) from MatLab’s Optimization
Toolbox is used to maximize the following log-likelihood function of the observed gene frequencies using

Our initial model only carried out the optimization
with respect to N and π; but did not allow the values of
μk (where k <K) to vary during the maximization of the
log-likelihood of the observed data. The revised model
removes this restriction, and the results obtained using
this revised model yield insights not previously available.
An overview of the results obtained using the revised
model is shown for three human bacterial pathogens:
Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and
Staphylococcus aureus (Figure 3). The results obtained
for these three supragenomes differ significantly in their
plots of the log-likelihood of the observed data against
the values of supragenome size N that were examined
during the optimization. Fortuitously, these results illustrate two contrasting types of supragenomes (H. influenzae and S. aureus) and a third (S. pneumoniae) whose
general characteristics are intermediate between these
two types. Thus, a broad plateau was observed in this
plot for H. influenzae, whereas the log-likelihood plot
for S. aureus declined very abruptly at estimated values
of N that were significantly greater than the estimated
size of its supragenome (Figure 3, upper panels). The
revised supragenome model employed herein has the
advantage that values of μk (where k <K) are allowed to
vary during the maximization of the log-likelihood.

Figure 3 Finite supragenome model results using (K = 6) variable population gene frequency classes. In our previous supragenome
analyses carried out with Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae we used a version of the finite supragenome model that
required fixed population gene frequency classes. This model has been updated to make the optimization function (the log-likelihood of the
observed sample gene frequency histogram, i.e., the observed gene frequency class distribution among the |S| strains examined) dependent on
the values of the population gene frequency vector (μ) as well as the values of the corresponding mixture coefficient vector (π, for the
probability that a gene in a supragenome will be represented in one of the K classes of population gene frequencies). For a given species, the
bottom graph plots the values of the vector μ against the product of the estimate of supragenome size and the values of the vector π, all
obtained at the maximization of the log-likelihood function.

Hence a priori estimates of fixed values for these parameters (i.e., as was required in our initial supragenome
model)–a procedure that the bottom panels of Figure 3
show is difficult–are conveniently avoided. At the
extreme case of the lowest population gene frequency
class, the values of μ1 and π1 at the maximization of the
log-likelihood of the observed data indicate that the H.
influenzae supragenome is dominated by a large pool of
very rare genes. In contrast, the value for μ1 at the maximization of the log-likelihood of the observed data for
the S. aureus supragenome (0.11) is an order of magnitude greater than that of H. influenzae. At the other
extreme of population gene frequencies, even though
the estimated size of the S. aureus supragenome at
3,221 chromosomal genes is the smallest value for N
observed among these three species, the absolute number of S. aureus core genes (2,245) and their fraction of
N (i.e., the value of πK = 0.6971) are both significantly
greater than the same values for either H. influenzae or
S. pneumoniae (Figure 3, lower panels). This estimate
that approximately 30% of the S. aureus genes are non-

core is in reasonable agreement with the results of earlier, more limited studies that used comparative genomic hybridization to estimate a value for this parameter
of 22% [30].
The finite supragenome model is predictive as well as
descriptive, Figure 4 shows the excellent correlation
between the observed sample gene frequency data from
the 17 S. aureus genomes under study (the number of
genes observed in exactly n = 1, 2, ..., 17 of these genomes) and the same values predicted using the values of
μ, π, and N obtained using our revised finite supragenome model trained on the sample data (all 17 strains).
Figure 5 (lower panels) shows the ability of the model
to predict the numbers of new, core, and the total number of chromosomal genes that should be detectable
after sequencing up to 30 S. aureus genomes. These
results agree very well with those obtained using the
results from our analyses of the 17 S. aureus genomes
under study (Figure 5, upper panels). They also indicate
that the sequencing of 30 S. aureus genomes will yield
99.5% of the total number and 99.4% of the core

chromosomal genes in this species’ supragenome (N =
3,221 genes).
Analyses of the RAST annotation data for the 17 S. aureus
genomes under study

The RAST annotation data for the S. aureus chromosomal CDS agreed very well with the results of our CDS
clustering procedure (Tables 4 and 5). Each CDS feature
in a GenBank-style annotation record (such as the ones
available from the RAST system) typically has a product
feature qualifier value associated with it. Table 4 shows
that 96% (3,038 of 3,155) of the orthologous clusters
generated by our CGS supragenome analysis pipeline
[21] were comprised of RAST-identified CDS that all
mapped to a single product feature qualifier value. Similar results were obtained when confining the analyses to
just the core clusters, i.e., the clusters with the largest
numbers of members, where there was 98% (2,122 of
2,266) agreement between the two methods. In those
cases where clusters were comprised of CDS that
mapped to more than a single product feature qualifier
value, the results were often understandable, e.g., the
additional product qualifier values were either undefined
(e.g., hypothetical protein) or imprecise (e.g., regulatory
protein). The reverse mapping–of S. aureus RAST annotation product feature qualifiers to CGS-identified CDS
clusters–was expected to be more problematic, but

Page 8 of 15

these results were also very robust (Table 5). In this
analysis 82% (258 of 316) of the RAST annotation CDS
product feature qualifiers that describe genes belonging
to distributed clusters appeared in only a single cluster,
and 91% (1,473 of 1,623) of the core cluster-derived
CDS product feature qualifiers were found in only a single cluster. The difference between the results in Tables
5 and 4 indicate that the reverse mapping (of CDS product feature qualifier values to gene clusters) is slightly
more susceptible to the problems cited above concerning imprecise CDS product descriptions.
Seven percent (220 of 3,155) of the chromosomal CDS
clusters (genes) found in the 17 S. aureus genomes
under study were comprised of CDS that were annotated as being phage-derived, and these genes were
unevenly distributed among the core, distributed and
unique gene sets. Thus, a query of the CDS product feature qualifier values for the term phage anywhere in the
product name yielded a mapping of the CDS annotations to 7 core, 190 distributed, and 23 unique clusters.
Thus, although 72% (2,266), 24% (755), and 4% (134) of
the chromosomal CDS clusters found in the 17 S. aureus genomes under study represented core, distributed,
and unique genes, 3%, 86%, and 11% of the phagederived genes, respectively, were from these three classes
of gene clusters.
The distinctive strategy of the RAST system is to have
domain experts maintain well-curated subsystem functional annotations (e.g., metabolic pathways, regulatory
pathways, or cellular structures) that can be used across
bacterial genomes, instead of having the functional
annotation of individual bacterial genomes attempted
one-by-one by non-experts in the various subsystems
that these genomes may encode. Subsystems analysis of
the S. aureus chromosomal CDS annotations in the context of our gene clustering results was quite revealing
(Table 6) in that almost half of the core CDS clusters
could not be assigned to any RAST subsystem, as well
as 90% of the distributed cluster CDS and 94% of the
unique cluster CDS. These results highlight our very
limited understanding of the biology of this important
bacterial pathogen, as well as the need for improvements in functional annotation to keep pace with the
extraordinary productivity of DNA sequencing
technology.
The RAST annotation data also provided useful
insights into the presence or absence of genetic determinants of methicillin resistance (Table 7) in the genomes
of the 17 S. aureus strains under study. Thirteen gene
product descriptions indicated involvement of the CDS
expression product in resistance to the antibiotic of
choice for S. aureus infections, methicillin. Ten of these
13 genes were core genes, with the remaining three
genes mecA, mecI, and mecR1 distributed among more

Discussion
The first model for supragenome (or pan-genome) analysis [19] was developed using genomic DNA sequence
datasets from eight strains of the species Streptococcus
agalactiae, also known as group B Streptococcus (GBS).
This model was developed by fitting an exponential
decay function to a plot of the average number of core
genes observed with increasing numbers of genomes
examined (where the average was taken for all possible
permutations of the order of consideration of the genomes under study), and took the asymptote defined by
such a plot as an estimate of the size of the GBS core
genome. This model also fitted a second exponential
decay function to a plot of the average number of new
genes observed with increasing numbers of genomes
examined (where the average is taken as before), and

took the asymptote as an estimate of the number of new
genes that would be observed with each new GBS genome sequenced. Finally, this model also estimated the
size of the GBS pan-genome by deriving a third equation for its rate of growth. A recent review [31] proposed a revised version of this model that adopts a
power law fit (Heaps’ Law, from the field of information
retrieval) in lieu of the earlier exponential fit of the
observed data. In both the original and the power law
models, a threshold parameter (a) is used to distinguish
open and closed pan-genomes, where an open pan-genome (with a ≤ 1) is defined as one that will yield a nonzero number of new genes when each additional genome of the species is sequenced. More recently, with
the advent of ever less expensive sequencing technologies, making it possible to sequence scores of independent strains, it could be argued that modeling of the
supra/pan-genome is unnecessary since sequencing of
additional strains can be continued until no significant
number of novel genes are identified [32]
The probabilistic foundation of the model used in this
work [21] offers a somewhat different perspective, but
with the improvements described above that take into
account multiple gene frequency classes allows for accurate supragenome modeling of populations/species for
which it is not possible to obtain multiple independent
clonal lineages (i.e. unculturable organisms) for
sequence analysis. In these cases gene frequency were
inferred from the different sequence coverage levels
observed within the sequenced population. Since the
vast majority of bacterial species are not culturable, but
are now amenable to whole genome sequencing through
single cell isolation and whole genome amplification
techniques [33] our model can be used to estimate the
percentage of the supragenome that has been obtained
at intermediate coverage levels.
A recent comparison of the pan-genome model of
Tettelin et al. with our finite supragenome model
demonstrated that the two models make highly similar
predictions when provided the same dataset [26], thus
serving as a validation for both. However, both models
share fundamental challenges in areas such as the

selection of appropriate genomic DNA sequence datasets to use. For example, we chose not to include S. aureus plasmid DNA sequences, e.g., those associated with
the published genomes that were used in our analysis
(Table 1), nor the DNA sequences of the many S. aureus bacteriophage genomes that have been published
[34]. However, our analysis included three draft genomes from S. aureus strains that we sequenced, and
these unfinished genomes may contain plasmid-derived
contigs. The results in Table 3 in fact suggest that the
strain CGSSa01 may contain one or more S. aureus
plasmids. Its genome contains the largest number of
genes (2,648), and the 18 unique genes it contains are
significantly greater than all but two of the other 17
strains. A comprehensive review of the S. aureus genome [35] provides a detailed description of some of the
many plasmids and other mobile elements that it may
contain. Decisions about the inclusion or exclusion of
published plasmid and bacteriophage DNA sequences in
a supragenome analysis can therefore lead to systematic
error in estimates of counts of different classes of genes
(e.g., core and unique genes).
Other issues arise during the selection of appropriate
genomic DNA sequence datasets to use in a supragenome analysis. In this work we included genomes that
are known to be very closely related, e.g., those of
strains JH1 and JH9 [28], as well as one known outlier
genome (RF122) of bovine origin [36]. These decisions
can also be criticized as leading to systematic error in
estimates of counts of different classes of genes. However, inclusion of a limited number of closely related
and outlier strains also provide for useful internal controls for the results of the supragenome analysis. In
some respects, and especially for a species such as S.
aureus, bias in the selection of genomic DNA sequence
datasets to use in a supragenome analysis is unavoidable. Given the intense interest in clinically relevant
strains of S. aureus, one can reasonably expect that even
with the ever increasing affordability and subsequent
availability of bacterial genomic DNA sequence datasets,
the S. aureus strains selected for sequencing will for the
foreseeable future be dominated by epidemiologically

important clinical strains, and that the much more
quantitatively representative commensal S. aureus stains
that could be isolated from human subjects will be
under-represented in supragenome and other comparative genomic analyses.
The S. aureus core genome has been found to contain
a heptameric DNA sequence (GAAGCGG) that is
believed to protect it from uncontrolled rearrangements
[37]. This conserved crossover hotspot initiator or chi
site is not the only DNA sequence motif and associated
nucleic acid information processing system with a putative influence on the structure and maintenance of the
S. aureus supragenome. The Sau1 Type I restrictionmodification (RM) system has at least two important
influences in this regard [38]. First, it reduces the efficiency of conjugation between S. aureus and enterococci, the putative source of vancomycin resistance.
This is believed to explain why very few vancomycinresistant S. aureus strains have arisen, despite tremendous selective pressure acting on the bacterial flora of
patients treated with this drug [39]. Second, the Sau1
RM system’s multi-copy specificity gene, sau1hsdS, has
many alleles with significant population frequencies, and
these alleles correspond to the major S. aureus lineages.
Five copies of this gene occur in the RF122 genome;
three copies in the genomes of CGSSa01, MSSA476,
USA300, and USA300TCH15, and two copies in the
remaining genomes we examined (i.e., it appears to be a
multi-copy core gene found in all genomes examined).
The Sau1 RM system therefore not only controls horizontal gene flow into S. aureus from other species, but
also within S. aureus lineages via the polymorphic RM
specificity alleles of sau1hsdS loci [38].
Analysis of the supragenome of S. aureus isolates from
antibiotic-naïve populations would be an interesting
extension of this work. Paradoxically, antibiotic treatment increases S. aureus conjugation frequency [40];
induces S. aureus temperate phage to excise, replicate,
and transfer pathogenicity islands [41]; and when used
in combination therapies may unexpectedly increase the
spread of resistance among S. aureus strains [42]. In
some bacterial genomes the selection pressure exerted
by antibiotic exposure may also have the unexpected

effect of promoting multi-drug resistance due to positive
epistasis amongst combinations of alleles of antibiotic
resistance loci [43]. Thus, one might expect that S. aureus isolates from antibiotic-naïve populations would
yield an estimate of supragenome size smaller than that
reported here, and be comprised of an even larger percentage of core genes. The results of a supragenome
analysis may therefore represent an aggregate of the
results of environmental niche-specific supragenomes
affected by extrinsic agents such as antibiotics that modulate horizontal gene transfer, as well as regulatory
allele-specific supragenomes affected by intrinsic genetic
phenomena (such as the Sal1 system) that also modulate
horizontal gene transfer.
Another interesting extension of this work would be
an analysis of the supragenome of the related species
Staphylococcus sciuri, which is one of the most abundant staphylococcal species and a frequent epidermal
commensal of animals [44]. The mecA gene found in
methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains encodes
the PBP2A penicillin-binding protein, whose affinity for
b-lactam antibiotics acts as a sink that vitiates the efficacy of these drugs and protects native S. aureus PBPs
during their function as bacterial cell wall synthetic
enzymes [45]. Incorporation of the mecA gene into the
S. aureus genome is an unusual event, and requires both
a delivery entity called the staphylococcal chromosome
cassette (SCC), and a suitable but rarely encountered S.
aureus genetic background that can tolerate the

presence and expression of the mecA gene [45]. Staphylococcus sciuri, although susceptible to b-lactam antibiotics, is believed to be the source of the precursor
homolog of the mecA gene present in the limited number of MRSA strains that have emerged worldwide [45].
Although limited in number, MRSA strains have spread
in an epidemic manner with devastating clinical consequences. The S. sciuri genome appears to be ubiquitously agreeable to the presence and expression of its
mecA precursor homolog [44], and hence a study of the
S. sciuri supragenome may yield insights into the genetic
determinants whose homologs in, or horizontal acquisition by, a S. aureus genome may predispose to the
acquisition of mecA.

Conclusions
The supragenome of S. aureus offers a significant contrast to those of other human bacterial pathogens
including H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae which share
the nasopharynx as their primary site of colonization.
The S. aureus supragenome (3,221 chromosomal genes)
was the smallest among these three species, yet it contained the largest number (2,245) of core genes (Figure
3). H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae each has a larger
horizontal gene pool [45] to draw from by virtue of
their possession of autocompetence and autotransformation systems which facilitate the horizontal acquisition
of new genes [21,22]. Although some strains of S. aureus
are deadly pathogens, most are not, and when compared

Boissy et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:187
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/187

to H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae, the S. aureus supragenome may have co-evolved with its human host for a
longer period of time. As a result, there may be relatively less selection pressure on the S. aureus supragenome to maintain a larger size, as over an extended
period of evolutionary time it has optimized its ability to
maintain core and distributed phenotypes to survive the
environmental conditions it typically encounters as a
predominantly commensal species of its human host.
Finally, we are currently extending the bioinformatic
analyses described herein with the development of a
free, post-annotation software package for the execution
of the full supragenome analysis pipeline described here.
This project will provide the community with the ability
to reproduce a given set of published supragenome analysis results, re-analyze the underlying data after modification of the parameters used during an analysis, and
perform more detailed and insightful querying of the
results than can be summarized in a typical journal
publication.

Methods
DNA sequencing and genome assembly

The genomes of three S. aureus strains CGSSa00,
CGSSa01, and CGSSa03 were sequenced at the Center
for Genomic Sciences (CGS). All three are low-passage
clinical isolates obtained from patients in Pittsburgh,
and were obtained, respectively, from: (i) a nasal specimen from an asymptomatic individual; (ii) an elbow
arthroplasty infection [46]; and (iii) a chronic abdominal
mesh implant infection that developed after ventral herniorrhaphy [47]. Each high-coverage (~20X) draft genome assembly was obtained using data generated on a
Roche/454 Life Sciences GS-FLX instrument using one
region of a two-region 70 × 75 mm pico-titer plate [47].
De novo draft genome assemblies were obtained using
the Newbler assembler, software releases 1.1.01.20
(CGSSa00) and 1.1.03.24 (CGSSa01 and CGSSa03).
Newbler’s default assembly parameters were used except
for the minimum overlap identity (MOI) percentages
(default = 90%) used for the CGSSa01 and CGSSa03
assemblies, which were 96% and 97%, respectively. For
each genome the optimal Newbler genome assembly
was chosen (from a series of assemblies using different
MOI values) as the one that yielded the smallest number of large contigs, the longest overall assembly length,
and the smallest percentage of Q39minus Newbler-estimated assembly base-call quality values. An initial round
of gap closure of the genome assembly of strain
CGSSa00 was carried out as described [22]. Table 1 provides information about these three genomes and the 14
previously sequenced S. aureus genomes used in the
comparative and supragenome analyses. Genomic DNA
sequence assembly accession numbers for all genomes

Page 13 of 15

(Table 2) and publicly available FASTA files for the 14
reference genomes used were obtained from the NCBI.
Automated bacterial genome annotation and generation
and identification of protein-encoding gene clusters

The RAST system (Rapid Annotation using Subsystem
Technology; http://rast.nmpdr.org/) [24] using default
parameters was used to provide a consistent set of automated genome annotations for the bacterial chromosome assemblies of all 17 strains. Annotation output
datasets were downloaded, and then in-house developed
software was used to parse the protein-encoding gene
features and prepare tranches of FASTA-formatted
input files (proteins, genes, and genomes) for allagainst-all sequence alignment jobs using the FASTA
and TFASTY software [27] installed on the Codon computing cluster at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center,
all as described [21,22]. Subsequent steps in the proteinencoding gene-clustering generation and identification
procedures were also performed as described [21,22],
with the exception that version 2 (instead of version 1)
of the multiple sequence alignment program Partial
Order Alignment (POA2) [27] was used during the CDS
gene clustering procedure.
Neighbor Grouping of S. aureus genomes

After the core (orthologs present in all genomes), distributed (orthologs present in two or more but not all
genomes), and unique (present in only one genome)
genes were identified, the presence or absence of the
distributed genes in each of the 17 strains was used to
define neighbor groups of the genomes under study, as
described [23]. Briefly, neighbor grouping examines a
pair-wise distance matrix in which the distance between
a given pair of genomes is equal to the fraction of the
distributed genes that is either present in both genomes
or absent in both genomes. A pair of genomes are
neighbors if the distance between them is less than the
mean distance between each pair of genomes under
study, minus the standard error of the mean. A valid
neighbor group is a sub-graph comprised of two or more
nodes (genomes) that are connected by nearest-neighbor
edges.
Mathematical modeling of the S. aureus supragenome

MatLab (version 7.1) and its Optimization Toolbox were
used to develop a revised finite supragenome model [21]
that allows the estimates of the population gene frequencies (for a limited number K of classes of genes) to
vary during the maximization of the log-likelihood of
the observed sample gene frequency data. The number
of elements (K) of the population gene frequency vector
(μ) and the corresponding mixture coefficient vector (π)
was set at 6; the initial values of π were all set to 1/K,

Boissy et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:187
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/187

and the initial values of μ were {0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9,
1.0}. The MatLab programs used for the revised finite
supragenome model will be provided upon request.
