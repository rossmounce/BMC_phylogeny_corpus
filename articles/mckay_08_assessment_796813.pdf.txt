Abstract
Background: Analyses of population structure and breed diversity have provided insight into the
origin and evolution of cattle. Previously, these studies have used a low density of microsatellite
markers, however, with the large number of single nucleotide polymorphism markers that are now
available, it is possible to perform genome wide population genetic analyses in cattle. In this study,
we used a high-density panel of SNP markers to examine population structure and diversity among
eight cattle breeds sampled from Bos indicus and Bos taurus.
Results: Two thousand six hundred and forty one single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
spanning all of the bovine autosomal genome were genotyped in Angus, Brahman, Charolais, Dutch
Black and White Dairy, Holstein, Japanese Black, Limousin and Nelore cattle. Population structure
was examined using the linkage model in the program STRUCTURE and Fst estimates were used
to construct a neighbor-joining tree to represent the phylogenetic relationship among these
breeds.
Conclusion: The whole-genome SNP panel identified several levels of population substructure in
the set of examined cattle breeds. The greatest level of genetic differentiation was detected

between the Bos taurus and Bos indicus breeds. When the Bos indicus breeds were excluded from
the analysis, genetic differences among beef versus dairy and European versus Asian breeds were
detected among the Bos taurus breeds. Exploration of the number of SNP loci required to
differentiate between breeds showed that for 100 SNP loci, individuals could only be correctly
clustered into breeds 50% of the time, thus a large number of SNP markers are required to replace
the 30 microsatellite markers that are currently commonly used in genetic diversity studies.

Background
Population structure and diversity within and between
breeds of cattle have been studied to learn more about the
origin, history and evolution of cattle [1-3]. Diversity
studies and subsequent investigations concerning domestication events of Bos taurus and Bos indicus cattle have
included sequencing from the displacement loop of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)[1]. Bradley et al. [1] used
mtDNA sequence variation in 90 extant bovines from
Africa, Europe and India to identify patterns of genetic
variation consistent with the demographics of the domestication process. When nuclear marker have been used to
study diversity in cattle, they have principally entailed
microsatellite markers [2]. MacHugh et al. [2] used 20
microsatellites to help clarify the genetic relationships
between cattle populations from Africa, Europe and Asia
and provided support for a separate origin of domestication for Bos taurus and Bos indicus cattle. Analysis of allelic
variation has been used to characterize the genetic relationships between breeds [4-7]. Kumar et al. [4] used 20
microsatellite markers to estimate the extent of genetic
differentiation among breeds of cattle from India, Europe
and the Near East. Assuming two ancestral populations,
the mean admixture coefficients ranged from 0.0 to 0.1 in
Indian Bos indicus breeds, 0.9 to 1.0 in European Bos taurus
breeds and from 0.1 to 0.9 in hybrid breeds from the Near
East. This variation in admixture coefficients reflects the
ancestral divergence between the Bos taurus and Bos indicus
subspecies. Similarly, Wiener et al. [5] characterized the
diversity within and between eight British breeds of cattle
using 30 microsatellite markers and found that the majority of the allelic variation (87%) was found within breeds.
In addition, the studied breeds of cattle did not cluster
according to their current geographic location, suggesting
that the genetic origin of breeds was from different geographical regions. In a study of the origin of Chirikof
Island cattle, MacNeil et al. [6] also found that 86% of the
genetic variation in 34 microsatellite loci was found
within Bos taurus breeds while the remaining 14% of
genetic variation was found between breeds. However, the
indigenous Chirikof Island cattle were strongly differentiated from the European Bos taurus cattle suggesting that a
comparison between Asian Bos taurus breeds might next
be appropriate. On the other hand, no significant divergence appears to exist between geographically separated
populations of Holstein cattle probably due to historic

occurrences of gene flow between populations and selection for similar traits [8]. Up to now most studies have
focused on a small set of microsatellite loci, typically the
30 suggested by the FAO [9]. The true extent of autosomal
diversity among cattle breeds has yet to be extensively
explored. Here, we examine population substructure and
interbreed diversity among eight breeds of cattle using
2,641 autosomal genome-wide SNPs.

Results and Discussion
Preliminary analyses were performed using the STRUCTURE software. We first explored the appropriate number
of iterations for the initial burn-in and estimation phases
of the analysis. These preliminary analyses indicated that
the probability of the number of ancestral populations
(the K parameter from STRUCTURE) being greater than
five was very small and therefore we restricted our analyses of all datasets to K ≤ 5 to limit computation time (data
not shown). Analyses were performed on three datasets
which used the full complement of markers but varied
according to breed representation. The first analysis
included data for all eight breeds, the second dataset
included only the six taurine breeds and the third analysis
included all Bos taurus breeds excluding the Japanese
Black. The number of ancestral populations (K) that were
subsequently admixed to form these breeds was estimated
using the method described by Evanno et al. [10] and was
found to be no greater than two for each data set (Figure
1). The ΔK method of Evanno et al. [10] cannot be calculated at K = 1; however, the log-likelihood of the data,
logP(X|K) in Figure 1, indicates that K = 1 can be excluded
for all three of the analyzed datasets. The average estimated admixture coefficients (the Q parameters from
STRUCTURE) of individuals from each breed are summarized in Figure 2 assuming two ancestral populations in
each case.
The results presented in Figures 1a and 2a demonstrate
that a considerable source of variation among cattle is the
partitioning of breeds into the Bos indicus and Bos taurus
subspecies. The variance between these groups (Table 1)
accounted for 18.8% of the total variation (FCT = 0.19)
which was significant (P ≤ 0.036). However, 71.06% of
the genetic variation was found within populations. It
should be noted that the SNP loci used in this study were
detected in Bos taurus and their average minor allele frePage 2 of 9

quency was much lower in Bos indicus. This ascertainment
bias may have resulted in underestimated FST values
between breeds within both the Bos taurus and Bos indicus
types, making them appear more similar than they really
are and overestimating FST values between the Bos taurus
and Bos indicus breeds, making them appear more different than they really are. Despite this, the topography of
the phylogeny and of breed composition from the
STRUCTURE analyses should be correct, even if the distances between breeds are biased. Unfortunately, this supposition cannot be examined using our data, because the
vast majority of the SNPs in the public domain and that
were sampled for this study were discovered in Bos taurus
cattle using procedures that guaranteed that the most
common SNPs would be detected. The same problem
exists for the studies that have historically employed microsatellite loci, since the sampled loci were cloned primarily from Bos taurus cattle and the loci selected for
phylogenetic analysis were those possessing the most alleles when surveyed across populations. For example, Bos
taurus and Bos indicus breeds have previously been clustered within subspecies using STRUCTURE in an analysis
using 20 microsatellites. In a model with K = 2, Kumar et
al. [4] found that the mean admixture coefficient of taurine breeds ranged from 0.9 to 1.0 while that for the indicine breeds ranged from 0 to 0.1. Our mean admixture
coefficients ranged from 0.03 to 0.08 in Bos indicus and
from 0.54 to 0.67 in Bos taurus breeds. While our findings
are similar to those of Kumar et al. for the Bos indicus
breeds, results for the Bos taurus breeds differ substantially. This may be due either to the difference in number
of markers examined or, perhaps more likely, due to the
different mutation rates between microsatellite and SNP
loci. As the mutation rate for microsatellite loci is higher
than for SNP loci [11], using microsatellite markers would
most likely give higher estimates of divergence as measured by admixture.
To explore the population structure among the taurine
breeds, a second STRUCTURE analysis was performed
removing the two indicine breeds, and using data from
the six taurine breeds (Figure 1b). This analysis identified

Japanese Black cattle as being distinct from the cluster
comprising the remaining five taurine breeds (Figure 2b).
However, the partitioning was not strongly supported by
the analysis of molecular variance (Fct = 0.09; P < 0.17;
Table 1). The mean admixture coefficients for the European taurine breeds ranged from 0.43 to 0.60 while values
for the Japanese Black ranged from 0.1 to 0.29. The upper
and lower quartile range of the admixture coefficients for
the individual Japanese Black animals were not as symmetric as found for the European taurine breeds (Figure
2b) and were skewed towards the European taurine
breeds, suggesting a recent influence of European Bos taurus breeds within Japanese Black. Previously published
reports describe the use of European breeds to upgrade
Japanese Black cattle [12] which is supported by these
data. Several domestication events have been suggested
for cattle involving different strains of aurochs, including
an independent taurine domestication event in Asia
[12,13]. These results suggest that the Japanese Black
breed is genetically distinct from the European taurine
breeds and because the divergence greatly exceeds the variation between the beef and dairy breeds (Figure 2b), we
believe that an independent Asian domestication event is
more likely to explain the divergence than does selection
or drift following domestication. The within breed variation in the admixture coefficient Q in Figure 2 also supports this contention. Provided the Japanese Black
population does not represent a recent cross among divergent populations, the increased variation within this population is consistent with the hypothesis of a local Asian
domestication event. Additional Asian derived cattle
breeds will need to be tested to assess the weight of evidence for this hypothesis. However, our data are completely consistent with the origin of Japanese Black cattle
being from an independent Asian domestication.
The third STRUCTURE analysis considered the remaining
Bos taurus breeds after excluding the Japanese Black and
resulted in a clustering of the meat and dairy breeds (Figures 1c, 2c). The mean admixture coefficients demonstrate
considerably less variation within the Continental European breeds, which is consistent with the small effective

population size that must have accompanied the introduction into North America of small samples of animals
from these Continental breeds. The strong selection for
milk production in the Holstein breed in conjunction
with the extensive use of artificial insemination has
reduced the genetic diversity within this breed and is
apparent in these data. Surprisingly, therefore, the Dutch
Black and White cattle had the greatest variation among
all of the breeds studied suggesting that selection for milk
production has been less intense in this breed than in
Holsteins. Interestingly, 4.65% of the variation was found
between the beef and dairy groups (FCT = 0.04) (Table 1)
with a p value of 0.10 that was suggestive, but not significant. This variation suggests that artificial selection within
cattle for alternate agricultural purposes has led to a
genome wide divergence among the beef and dairy
breeds. Additional analyses in which the genomic regions
at which divergence between the types is greatest are overlaid with detected meat and milk QTL would be of considerable interest.
All of the STRUCTURE analyses using the three datasets
supported the existence of two ancestral populations partitioning the breed types. Assuming that these represent
the true number of ancestral populations, we sought to
answer the question, how many loci would be required to
precisely estimate the number of ancestral populations?
We randomly sampled the dataset of 2,641 loci to produce 10 datasets with 25, 50, 100 or 150 loci and repeated
each of the previous analyses. The results presented in Figure 3 show the results of each of the replicate analyses. At
the subspecies level (Figure 3a), the correct number of
ancestral populations was accurately inferred with as few
as 25 loci. This is clearly due to the large divergence
between the Bos indicus and Bos taurus subspecies which is
demonstrated by the difference in the mean admixture
coefficients in Figure 2a. The second analysis, which
included only taurine breeds, demonstrates that using as
many as 150 randomly chosen loci only yields the correct
number of clusters in 40% of the instances (Figure 3b).
This is most likely a result of the closer relationship
between the taurine breeds (Figure 2b), and the presence
of two levels of substratification among these breeds
(Asian vs. beef vs. dairy). The third analysis, which
excluded the Japanese Black breed, more frequently
detected two ancestral populations (Figure 3c), which primarily detected the remaining beef vs. dairy strata in the
data. Not surprisingly, it is evident from this set of analyses that the number of random SNP loci needed to accurately infer population structure is dependent on the
divergence between populations. Earlier studies seeking
to characterize the genetic diversity within and between
breeds of cattle used 30 microsatellites [5]. Approximately
three times the number of SNPs are needed compared to
microsatellites [14], therefore, 150 SNPs should have

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/9/37

been ample for inference of population structure. However, 150 SNPs still detected incorrect clustering among
taurine breeds. Seldin et al. [15] reported similar results
when trying to differentiate Northern and Southern European human populations using 400 randomly selected
SNP loci and suggested the limited number of SNPs used
as the potential problem. Clearly, future studies which
seek to evaluate the relationships among closely related
cattle breeds will require a larger number of SNP loci to
accurately infer breed relationships.
Finally, we generated pairwise population Fst estimates
using the complete dataset of 2,641 loci (Table 1) and
used these to construct an unrooted Neighbor-Joining tree
(Figure 4). This analysis is consistent with expectations,
with the two French breeds clustering together, the Dutch
Black and White and Holstein also clustered, with short
branch lengths. The European group of Limousin, Charolais, Angus, Holstein and Dutch Black and White is separated from the Japanese Black, and the taurine breeds are
separated from the indicine breeds. These estimates of
genetic distance and the tree topology support the findings of the STRUCTURE analyses.

Conclusion
The recent completion of a draft bovine genome sequence
assembly has provided sufficient numbers of SNP loci to
replace microsatellite loci and augment mtDNA
sequences for population genetic analyses in cattle. We
have shown that SNP loci can be used to identify population substructure among cattle breeds. However, we have
demonstrated that a large number of SNP loci must be
used to obtain an equivalent degree of precision in estimates of diversity compared with microsatellite loci, due
to the lower information content of individual SNP loci.
At issue is the importance of ascertainment of these loci to
the phylogenies that are constructed. Because the majority
of available SNPs were detected as the most common SNP
within Bos taurus breeds, certain biases must exist within
the analyses. However, the extent of these biases can only
be quantified when these analyses are repeated using
unbiased samples of loci, which to date, do not exist.

Methods
DNA Collection
DNA was collected from the following Bos taurus breeds:
70 Angus (USA), 20 Canadian Angus, 40 Charolais (Canada), 97 Dutch Black and White dairy cattle (Belgium), 48
Holstein (USA), 65 Japanese Black (Japan) and 43 Limousin (USA). Additionally, DNA was collected from two Bos
indicus breeds: 40 Brahman (USA) and 97 Nelore (Brazil).
Family structure and the number of individuals per family
varied between breeds but the general family structure
consisted of a grandparent, parent and three or more
progeny. To determine the phase of alleles on the chromo-

somes using linkage information, we selected small families where members within the families were closely
related but the families themselves were as unrelated as
possible. This three generation family structure allowed
for the efficient estimation of marker phase relationships

in the progeny and also produced the most likely phase
relationships in each of the parents and grandparents.

number of populations (the K parameter of STRUCTURE), each of these three data sets was analyzed allowing
the value of K to vary from 1 to 5 and each run was
repeated five times to produce a total of 75 STRUCTURE
runs. Using the method of Evanno et al. [10] we calculated
ΔK which is an ad hoc quantity related to the second order
rate of change of the log probability (likelihood) of the
data Pr(X|K) (equation 12 in [22]) with respect to the
number of population clusters K.

al. [16]. Briefly, sequence information for SNPs (see Additional file 1) was obtained from public databases and
SNPs were genotyped as a GoldenGate® assay using an
Illumina BeadStation 500 G [17]http://www.illu
mina.com. Loci included in this study met the following
criteria; minor allele frequency (MAF) ≥ 0.05 in Angus
based on previous screens (data not shown) and concordant locus order between radiation hybrid (RH) maps [18]
and genomic sequence location. The software GENOPROB V2.0 [19,20] was used to assess genotype score
quality and to produce whole chromosome phased maternal and paternal haplotypes based on the pedigree and
map locations of the loci.

Assuming the full dataset of 2,641 loci would yield the
most accurate estimate of the true number of ancestral
populations, we sought to determine the effect of the
number of loci analyzed on inferences of K. Three new
data sets each with 10 replicates were created by randomly
sampling 25, 50, 100 or 150 loci from the 2,641 markers.
Each replicate was analyzed using STRUCTURE as previously described except the admixture model was used
rather than the linkage model as linkage among the sampled loci was assumed to be lost due to randomly sampling loci throughout the genome.
Finally, Fst values, population corrected average pairwise
differences and analyses of molecular variance (AMOVA)
were performed with the program ARLEQUIN [23] using
the phased genotypes for each animal produced by
GENOPROB V2.0. Significance levels for variance components and F statistics were estimated using 10,000 permutations. MEGA [24] was used to construct a NeighborJoining tree from the pairwise Fst values (Table 2).

Population Structure Analysis
STRUCTURE and the linkage model of Falush et al. [21]
were used to evaluate the extent of substructure among
contemporary breeds of European and Asian Bos taurus
and Bos indicus cattle. Exploratory STRUCTURE runs were
used to determine the optimum number of iterations for
the initial burn-in and estimation phases of the analysis to
ensure that the Gibbs sampler had explored a sufficiently
large sample space to provide reliable posterior probabilities. From these preliminary analyses, we determined that
an initial burn-in of 10,000 iterations followed by 10,000
iterations for parameter estimation was sufficient to
ensure convergence of parameter estimates (data not
shown). We performed a series of analyses (runs) that
were based on inclusion of differing combinations of cattle breeds in an attempt to determine the minimum
number of ancestral populations that were admixed to
best explain the genomic architecture of the current set of
breeds. The first run used all of the animals from all 8
breeds. The second run used the 6 taurine breeds (Angus,
Charolais, Limousin, Dutch Black and White Dairy, Holstein and Japanese Black) while the third run used the taurine breeds without the Japanese Black. To estimate the
