Abstract
Background: The origin and evolution of viruses is currently a heavily discussed issue. One
element in this discussion is the innate viral "self" concept, which suggests that viral structures and
functions can be divided into two categories. The first category consists of genetic determinants
that are inherited from a viral ancestor and encode the viral "self". The second group consists of
another set of structures and functions, the "nonself", which is interchangeable between different
viruses and can be obtained via lateral gene transfer. Comparing the structures and sequences of
the "self" elements, we have proposed that viruses can be grouped into lineages regardless of which
domain of life (bacteria, archaea, eukarya) they infect. It has also been suggested that viruses are
ancient and possibly predate modern cells.
Results: Here we identified thirteen putative prophages (viral genomes integrated into bacterial
chromosome) closely related to the virulent icosahedral tailless lipid-containing bacteriophage
PM2. Using the comparative genomics approach, we present evidence to support the viral "self"
hypothesis and divide genes of the bacteriophage PM2 and related prophages into "self" and
"nonself" categories.
Conclusion: We show here that the previously proposed most conserved viral "self"
determinants, the major coat protein and the packaging ATPase, were the only proteins that could
be recognized in all detected corticoviral elements. We also argue here that the genes needed for
viral genome replication, as well as for host cell lysis, belong to the "nonself" category of genes.
Furthermore, we suggest that abundance of PM2-like viruses in the aquatic environment as well as
their importance in the ecology of aquatic microorganisms might have been underestimated.

Background
Recently observed structural relationships between the
architectures of viruses infecting hosts from the three
domains of life [1-4] poured fuel onto the discussion of
the origin and evolution of viruses [5-11]. It is now evident that viruses are ancient and that very diverse virus

families may have arisen from a relatively small number
of primordial viral ancestors. We have suggested previously that a limited number of features represent the
essence of a virus and that viruses sharing such characteristics can be joined into lineages. Those features are
responsible for the formation of a functional virion and

are referred here as the viral "self" (discussed in
[5,6,8,12,13]). On the other hand, components encoded
in viral genome and needed for interaction with the host
are assumed to be nonessential for the virion formation
and thus represent the "nonself" category, although they
are indispensable for viral genome replication and the
interaction of the virus with its host.
Ascribing viral properties to "self" or "nonself" categories
for highly divergent viruses, which nonetheless, belong to
the same viral lineage [12], is based on structural and
functional relationships. However, these relationships
often cannot be revealed using sequence analysis due to
the lack of detectable similarity. Components of the viral
"self" in more closely related viruses are expected to be
conserved also at the sequence level. The first direct support for the presence of the "self" elements was obtained
when genomes of six tectiviruses were compared [13]. The
analysed viruses were highly similar (overall identities
between 91.9% and 99.8%), but there were clear differences in the number of altered nucleotides between the
genes. Genes for structural elements and those for genome
packaging were the most conserved, whereas the virus
entry and release-related genes were the least conserved
ones [13].
Bacteriophage PM2, the only known member of the Corticoviridae virus family [14], is a tailless marine bacteriophage that was isolated from the coastal seawater in
Chile [15]. There are so far only two closely related Pseudoalteromonas species, Pseudoalteromonas espejiana BAL-31
and Pseudoalteromonas sp. ER72M2, which PM2 was
shown to infect [16,17]. The PM2 virion consists of an
icosahedrally organized proteinaceous capsid surrounding a protein-rich lipid membrane, which encloses a
highly supercoiled circular double-stranded DNA
(dsDNA) genome [18-20]. Replication of the viral
genome takes place near the cytoplasmic membrane via a
rolling-circle mechanism initiated by the phage-encoded
replication initiation protein P12 [19,21]. The 10 079 bplong PM2 genome is organised into three operons – two
early and one late [22]. The two early operons are transcribed in opposite directions. The leftwards-transcribing
early operon encodes transcriptional repressors (P15 and
P16, genes XV and XVI, respectively), while the rightwards-transcribing early operon codes for protein(s)
required for genome replication, transcription activators
of the late operon (proteins P13 and P14), as well as one
structural protein, the packaging ATPase P9. The rest of
the structural protein-coding genes (genes I-VIII and X) as
well as genes (XVII, XVIII) encoding proteins involved in
the cell lysis are located in the late rightwards-transcribing
operon and are tightly packed. PM2 is a virulent phage
and has not been shown to lysogenize its host cells.

In this study we identified thirteen PM2-like elements
residing in the genomes of eleven aquatic proteobacteria.
Comparative analysis of gene composition between the
identified putative prophages and bacteriophage PM2 let
us to test and support the viral "self" hypothesis. Furthermore, our results show that PM2-like elements are abundant in the genomes of aquatic bacteria and therefore the
role of tailless bacteriophages on aquatic microorganisms
might be underestimated.

Results and discussion
Putative corticoviral prophages were identified by homology-based searches against the nonredundant protein
database at NCBI. For our search, we selected gene encoding the canonical viral "self" element, the major coat protein (MCP) P2 [20]. In all of these cases, genes for the
packaging ATPase P9 [20,23,24] homologues were
observed in the proximity of the P2-encoding genes. It
should be noted that this approach enables detection of
only close phage relatives that have not yet diverged to a
point where homologous sequences are no longer recognizable [6]. Thirteen homologues of P2-encoding genes
were identified in eleven bacterial genomes. PM2 genome
is 10 079 bp-long, therefore an approximately 15 kb-long
region surrounding the P2/P9-encoding pair of genes was
further examined for the presence of other putative PM2related genes.
When protein sequences homologous to the MCP of bacteriophage PM2 were assayed for structure prediction,
they all matched, as the first hit, to the MCP of the Paramecium bursaria chlorella virus 1 (PBCV-1) [4], although
the scores were low (below the significance value, E > 1).
Interestingly, validation for this observation was obtained
from the ongoing structural characterization of the MCP
P2 of phage PM2 [25]. Our preliminary results indicate
that P2 has the same topology as the other members of the
PRD1-adeno viral lineage [Abrescia et al., to be published], which among others also includes PBCV-1 [8].
Analysis of the corticoviral elements
Four functionally distinct groups of genes constitute the
PM2 genome. These are genes encoding proteins responsible for genome replication (replication initiation protein P12), transcription regulation (transcription factors
P13–P16), structural components of the virion (proteins
P1–P10), and proteins involved in cell lysis (P17, P18).
The core viral "self" determinants, genes II (protein P2)
and IX (protein P9), are separated by the late promoter
region and a short gene VII coding for structural protein
P7. An open reading frame (ORF) corresponding to gene
VII as well as an intergenic region matching the PM2 late
promoter (coloured yellow in Fig. 1) were also recognized
in all thirteen putative prophages. The region coding for
gene II/IX homologs was always found as a block, exactly

as in the PM2 genome, except in Photobacterium profundum
species SS9 and 3TCK, where the putative prophages contained an additional ORF (Fig 1). Genes coding for structural proteins P5, P8, and P10 were found in 54%, 62%,
and 77% of putative corticoviral elements, respectively
(Fig. 1). Notably, Vibrio parahaemolyticus RIMD2210633
contained two copies of the PM2-like element, one in
each of its two chromosomes, while Methylobacillus flagellatus KT had two absolutely identical (at the nucleotide
level) elements in its single chromosome.
As mentioned above, the PM2 genome is organised into
three operons – two early and one late [22]. The maintenance region of Pseudoalteromonas plasmid pAS28 [26]
was shown to share similar genomic organisation with the
two early transcriptional units of PM2 [22]. Significant
sequence similarity was found only between the leftwards-transcribing operons and the promoter regions (see
Fig. 1). Replication protein coding genes of the pAS28
plasmid (ORF 1) and phage PM2 (gene XII) did not share
any sequence similarity, although they were located at the
equivalent positions (see Fig. 1). In light of those observations, it was proposed that the entire leftwards-transcribing early operon together with the promoter region was
obtained from the Pseudoalteromonas plasmid pAS28 via
horizontal gene transfer [22]. Both genes, XV and XVI,
were detected in putative prophages of Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio vulnificus CMCP6, and Photobacterium profundum SS9, where they were flanking the rest of the viral
genes. The remaining corticoviral elements (four out of
nine) contained either gene XV or XVI. Interestingly, it
seems that in all cases the presumably circular genomes of
the corticoviral elements were linearized between the gene
XV and XVI. Gene XV was shown to be dispensable in laboratory conditions [27], however, its presence in the
genomes of the putative prophages suggests that it might
play a beneficial role for the phage in the natural environment.
Surprisingly, gene XII-type replication initiation protein
genes were identified only in six of the eleven bacterial
species (PM2-type replication system), and ORF 1-type (as
in plasmid pAS28) replication protein genes were identified in three of the corticoviral elements (pAS28-type replication system). Putative prophage of Vibrio sp. MED222
encoded an ORF, the product of which shared sequence
similarity (23% identity, 59% similarity) with a unique
replication protein RepA (accession no. YP_025331) from
Pseudomonas alcaligenes plasmid pRA2 (pRA2-type replication system) [28]. Furthermore, an identical possible
DnaA protein binding site, 5'-TTATCCACA-3', essential
for pRA2 plasmid replication, was also found in the putative prophage sequence at the equivalent position, downstream of the repA gene. No putative replication proteincoding genes were identified in the Ralstonia eutropha H16

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/236

corticoviral element. However, we identified an ORF coding for a potential DNA binding protein containing the
so-called AT-hook motif [29]. The AT-hook motif has
been shown to be required for the replication and partitioning of Epstein-Barr virus oriP plasmids [30], as well as
for the origin recognition complex binding to the replication origin in fission yeast [31]. Therefore, it is possible
that the AT-hook protein might be involved in the replication of the corticoviral element in Ralstonia eutropha H16,
thus comprising the forth replication system (AT-hooktype) found in PM2-like elements. Furthermore, the AThook motif-containing protein in Ralstonia eutropha H16
shares sequence similarity with AT-hook motif proteins
from Ralstonia pickettii filamentous bacteriophage p12j
(accession no. AAQ90254; 35% identity; 54% similarity)
and Ralstonia solanacearum plasmid pJTPS1 (accession no.
BAA32222; 43% identity, 67% similarity), suggesting possible genetic exchanges between those three Ralstonia elements. Vibrio vulnificus CMCP6 has two chromosomes.
The putative corticoviral prophage was found on chromosome 2 only. This prophage has the ORF 1-type replication protein-coding gene. On the other hand,
chromosome 1 contains a gene, encoding a putative
homolog of the replication initiation protein P12
(NP_761302, E = 1e-65), but no other PM2-related genes.
It is possible that a genetic exchange event between the
two chromosomes of Vibrio vulnificus CMCP6 gave rise to
viruses with the gene XII-type replication initiation protein-coding genes.
We have previously noticed that in the same viral lineage
(viruses having a similar mechanism to assemble the virion) replication systems do not need to be related, i.e. the
"self" and the replication systems are uncoupled. The final
replication product just has to be specifically recognized
for genome packaging [12]. This observation is supported
here by the finding that putative PM2-like prophages
encode several types of replication systems. Consequently, genes for genome replication cannot be considered as being part of the viral "self" category, although
such genes are among the most conserved ones in viral
genomes. This is also true for the tailed dsDNA bacteriophages (order Caudovirales). It has been observed that
members of the Podoviridae family use two different strategies to replicate their genomes [32]. T7-like phages replicate their genomes by a primase/DNA polymerase
mechanism, while φ29-like podoviruses use a covalently
linked 5' terminal protein primer [33]. Both, T7 and φ29,
have the canonical HK97 MCP fold [34-36]. Interestingly,
icosahedral tailless lipid-containing phage PRD1, a type
member of the Tectiviridae family, also uses the latter strategy to replicate its linear dsDNA genome [37], but has a
completely different MCP topology [1].

Genetic organization of the putative corticoviral prophages, bacteriophage PM2 [19], and the maintenance region of the pAS28
plasmid [26]. Circular PM2 genome map is linearized at a unique EcoRII site [19]. Genes encoding structural and nonstructural
proteins (Roman numerals) and ORFs (lower case letters) are visualized as arrows indicating the direction of transcription. The
origin of replication (ORI) and the known promoters (kinked arrows) are indicated. All the elements are aligned to the major
coat protein-coding gene II of phage PM2, except for the pAS28 maintenance region, which is aligned to the PM2 gene XVI.
Genes in the corticoviral elements sharing sequence similarity with those of PM2 are named according to the previously established phage PM2 nomenclature [19] and are coloured blue. Genes in the PM2 genome, as well as in corticoviral elements
related to those of the pAS28 plasmid, are coloured red. The viral "self" core, containing genes IX, VII, and II is shaded grey.
The late promoter region of phage PM2 and the noncoding region matching its position in all putative prophages is coloured
yellow. Recombinase-coding genes and genes encoding replication-associated proteins (other than XII- and ORF1-type) are
shown in green and black, respectively. Putative CI repressor- and endolysin-coding genes, as well as the position of the DnaA
protein-binding site, are indicated. As a reference point, accession numbers of putative coat proteins of the identified corticoviral prophages are indicated in parenthesis under the corresponding bacterial species name. While exact nucleotide positions
of the depicted corticoviral elements can be found in the supplemental material table (see Additional file 1).

In order to escape from the infected cell, bacteriophages
have to overcome the cell envelope barrier. All dsDNA
bacteriophages characterized so far use the holinendolysin system to accomplish this step [38]. Holins are
small phage-encoded membrane proteins that, in a precisely scheduled manner, form nonspecific lesions in the
plasma membrane of the infected cell. Endolysins are
phage-encoded peptidoglycan-degrading enzymes that
may possess endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase, N-acetylmuramidase, N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase, and/
or endopeptidase activities. The endolysins are translocated to the periplasmic space or are activated with the aid
of holin proteins. However, no putative endolysins were
recognized in the PM2 proteome. Instead, we identified
genes (XVII and XVIII) that encode novel lysis-associated
proteins P17 and P18 [27,39]. We also discovered that
P18 homologues are encoded in the genomes of several
enteric (PaP3, Felix 01, and RB49) and marine (P-SSM4,
S-PM2, and P-SSM2) tailed bacteriophages [39]. This
illustrates that lysis genes may be exchanged between bacteriophages belonging to different lineages. Only the
putative prophage of Vibrio vulnificus CMCP6 contained a
homolog of PM2 gene XVII (32% identity, 82% similarity
at the amino acid level), while no homologues of gene
XVIII could be identified. Interestingly, putative endolysin
genes, similar to those of other dsDNA bacteriophages,
were found in corticoviral elements of Vibrio splendidus
12B01 and Vibrionales bacterium SWAT-3 (hits to putative
endolysin protein [NP_891673] of phage RB49; E = 4e-31
and E = 1e-30, respectively), Methylobacillus flagellatus KT
(lysozyme [NP_690649] of phage B103; E = 4e-27), Methylibium
petroleiphilum
PM1 (putative lysozyme
[NP_958065] of phage PsP3; E = 1e-25), and Ralstonia
eutropha H16 (lysin protein [NP_599082] of phage SfV; E
= 1e-28) (Fig. 1). Lysis genes have not been shown to participate in virion assembly, e.g. interfere with the "self"
function. As shown here, the same family of viruses may
have a very different set of genes responsible for progeny
release. Consequently, similarly to the replication systems, the lysis-related genes belong to the viral "nonself"
category.
In order to establish a stable relationship with the host
organism, temperate phages replicate in synchrony with
the bacterial chromosome. One mechanism to do so is to
integrate the phage genome as part of the host chromosome. This event is catalysed by recombinases (integrase,
transposase, invertase) that are often found adjacent to
the integration site of the phage genome, thus marking
one of the prophage ends [40,41]. However, not all temperate phages encode recombinases. For example, filamentous vibriophage CTXφ exploits host-encoded
recombinases XerC/D to integrate its genome into the
bacterial chromosome [42]. We identified putative integrases in corticoviral elements of Vibrio splendidus 12B01

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/236

(hit to integrase [YP_655517] of phage φMhaA1-PHL101,
E = 9e-18), Vibrionales bacterium SWAT-3 (hit to integrase
[AAO64735] of phage P2; E = 2e-74), and Oceanobacter sp.
RED65 (hit to integrase [YP_654712] of phage F108; E =
3e-64). While putative prophages of Vibrio sp. MED222
and Photobacterium profundum SS9 contained fragments of
putative transposase-coding genes (Fig. 1). In addition to
an integrase, putative prophages of Vibrio splendidus
12B01 and Vibrionales bacterium SWAT-3 encoded a CI/
Cro-type repressor [43], similar to that of a λ-like bacteriophage DMS3 (accession no. YP_950425; E = 1e-13 and E
= 7e-12, respectively). We do not currently know whether
any of the PM2-like elements is inducible. However, the
presence of recombinase-coding genes points to the
mobile character of these elements and suggests that at
least some of them are functional prophages.
Ecological considerations
In order to determine in what ecological niches the putative PM2-like prophages could be traced, we checked the
origins of the eleven bacteria harboring the corticoviral
elements. All of them turned out to be residents of the
aquatic ecosystem and were classified into the phylum
Proteobacteria in the NCBI Taxonomy database [44].

Marine bacteriophages are the most abundant biological
entities in the oceans. Since the oceans are the world's
largest biosphere, marine phages are probably the most
abundant biological entities on Earth, playing a vital role
in the carbon cycling through marine food webs, gene
transfer, and conversion of hosts by lysogeny ([45,46] and
references therein). Over 5100 bacterial viruses have been
examined in the electron microscope from 1959 to 2000.
Of these, about 4950 phages (96.4%) were tailed (order
Caudovirales) and only 186 phages (3.6%) were cubic, filamentous, or pleomorphic [47]. Tailed phage genomes
were also observed to be in great abundance maintained
inside the cell, constituting as much as 10 – 20% of some
bacterial genomes (reviewed in [41]).
In order to compare the relative abundance of PM2-like
elements maintained within aquatic bacteria with that of
the tailed bacteriophages, 269 genomes of aquatic bacteria available in GenBank (01.05.2007; see Additional file
1) were searched for the presence of putative prophages of
tailed viruses. For results to be comparable, the same identification approach as used here for the corticoviral elements was applied. We used the viral "self" determinants
of the tailed phages (marine myoviruses [five species],
podoviruses [four species], and siphoviruses [two species], as well as from well-studied enterobacterial phages
P2 [Myoviridae], λ [Siphoviridae], and T7 [Podoviridae]), i.e.
MCP and the larger subunit of the terminase protein,
although other virion proteins were suggested to suite better for prophage detection [41]. If the bacterial genomes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/236

contained genes coding for both selected proteins, we
assumed that a prophage is present on the chromosome
(Table 1). As the tailed phages are not the object of this
manuscript, no further detailed analysis was carried out.
However, using this approach the abundance of the putative "tailed" prophages represents the maximal chance to
be detected. The highest number of matches, twenty-two,
was obtained with MCP and terminase protein sequences
of enterophage P2. Among marine tailed phages analysed,
the most abundant seems to be bacteriophage VHMLtype, with close relatives identified in ten bacterial species.
Enteric siphovirus λ and marine podovirus VP16C each
had three relatives among 269 aquatic bacterial genomes
analysed. Only one of these bacterial species (Vibrio splendidus 12B01) contained both, the "self" determinants of
the tailed phage and the putative PM2-like prophage (see
Additional file 1). Notably, the two most abundant tailed
phages, P2 and VHML, are temperate. Therefore, it seems
that their abundance in the genomes of aquatic bacteria
reflects the lifestyle they utilize. Interestingly, PM2 and
VHML had almost the same number of matches (11 versus 10, respectively) (Table 1). However, it should be
noted that PM2 is a strictly lytic phage, which has never
been shown to enter the lysogenic pathway. There are no
grounds to believe that integration frequency of lytic
PM2-like phages should differ from that of the lytic tailed
phages. Furthermore, we assume that the quantity of
prophage-like elements is related to the quantity of freeliving viruses.

tailless or short-tailed phages are the predominant morphotype in marine samples [48-52]. Since 96% of phages
were proposed to be tailed [47], this observation was
explained as a result of the dissociation of tails from the
capsids during the sample preparation for TEM [46]. Our
data presented here suggests that the abundance of PM2like viruses versus tailed phages in the aquatic ecosystem
(Table 1) might be vastly underestimated (using a
prophage frequency criterion and assuming that mutational rate of the tailed and the PM2-like prophages is the
same). This is also supported by the recent sampling of
bacteriophages in alkaline hot springs at different geographical locations. Out of one-hundred-fifteen bacteriophage strains isolated during a trial, 50% were
icosahedral tailless dsDNA phages, while tailed ones constituted only 44% of isolates [53], suggesting that tailed
phages might not be dominant species in all ecological
niches. On the other hand, the recent metagenomic study
on free-living marine viruses suggested that the most
dominant phages are those related to tailed cyanophage
P-SSM2 [54]. However, the abundance of P-SSM2-like
phages is questionable as more than 91% of the metagenomic sequences were not significantly similar to any of
those in the database [54], therefore leaving space for
alternative interpretations when more virus sequence data
will be available. Interestingly, the same metagenomic
study revealed the previously overlooked high abundance
of small icosahedral tailless ssDNA phages (Microviridae
virus family) in the samples obtained from the Sargasso
Sea [54]. It is clear that the relative abundances of any type
of viruses cannot be accurately accessed until much more
data is available. It is also obviously that phage ecology is

PM2 is the only icoshedral tailless marine bacteriophage
characterized in detail. However, a number of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies have showed that

only gradually releasing its secrets and further surprises
are anticipated.

Conclusion
To our knowledge this is the first study showing that elements related to tailless dsDNA bacteriophages can be
identified in bacterial genomes. The comparative analysis
of the newly identified thirteen putative PM2-like elements, allowed us to test the innate viral "self" hypothesis
[5,6,8,13]. We show here that the previously proposed
most conserved viral "self" determinants, the major coat
protein and the packaging ATPase, were the only proteins
that could be found in all detected corticoviral elements.
We also argue here that the genes needed for viral genome
replication, as well as for host cell lysis, belong to the
"nonself" category of genes, and can be acquired via horizontal gene exchange as needed. Therefore, proteins of the
"nonself" category should not be used for the phylogenetic comparisons of different bacteriophages. In general,
we believe that all viral proteins that are in one way or
another involved in the viral interaction with its host
belong to the "nonself" category. Furthermore, we challenge here the common knowledge that the vast majority
of bacteriophages in aquatic environments belong to the
order Caudovirales (dsDNA phages with tails). We suggest
that abundance of PM2-like viruses in the aquatic environment as well as their importance in the ecology of
aquatic microorganisms might be well underestimated.

Methods
Putative corticoviral prophages were identified by homology-based searches against the nonredundant protein
database at NCBI. The major coat protein P2 (accession
no. NP_049903) of bacteriophage PM2 was used as a
query in the PSI-BLAST [55] searches with the default
parameters (BLOSUM62 matrix, 0.005 as an E-value cutoff). The search was iterated until no new sequences were
found above the 0.005 threshold value (two iterations).
In the case of a positive hit a ~15 kb region around the
gene coding for the counterpart of the phage PM2 protein
P2 was searched for putative prophage sequences using
Vector NTI Suite 8.0 (InforMax Inc). It should be noted
that outside the selected 15 kb region cellular genes
(involved in cellular metabolism or abundant in other
bacteria in which putative prophages could not be
detected) started to appear outside that region. Open
reading frames (ORF) were assigned as PM2-like genes if
1) the ORF pattern resembled that of PM2, 2) their putative protein products were clearly recognizable (up to
47% identity observed), 3) could be related to PM2 proteins by PSI-BLAST searches either directly, or through
PM2-like gene products identified in other putative
prophages. In the case of lower similarity (cutoff of 16%
identity) other comparisons such as secondary structure
[56] and protein topology [57] were used to confirm the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/236

relationship between the protein sequences. Major coat
protein homology detection and structure prediction was
carried out using the HHpred program with the default
parameters [58]. Nucleotide coordinates of the corticoviral elements detected in this study can be found in the
supplemental material table (see Additional file 1).
