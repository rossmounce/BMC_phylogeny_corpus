Abstract
Background: The Actinobacteria phylum represents one of the largest and most diverse groups
of bacteria, encompassing many important and well-characterized organisms including Streptomyces,
Bifidobacterium, Corynebacterium and Mycobacterium. Members of this phylum are remarkably diverse
in terms of life cycle, morphology, physiology and ecology. Recent comparative genomic analysis of
19 actinobacterial species determined that only 5 genes of unknown function uniquely define this
large phylum [1]. The cellular functions of these actinobacteria-specific proteins (ASP) are not
known.
Results: Here we report the first characterization of one of the 5 actinobacteria-specific proteins,
ASP1 (Gene ID: SCO1997) from Streptomyces coelicolor. The X-ray crystal structure of ASP1 was
determined at 2.2 . The overall structure of ASP1 retains a similar fold to the large NP-1 family of
nucleoside phosphorylase enzymes; however, the function is not related. Further comparative
analysis revealed two regions expected to be important for protein function: a central, divalent
metal ion binding pore, and a highly conserved elbow shaped helical region at the C-terminus.
Sequence analyses revealed that ASP1 is paralogous to another actinobacteria-specific protein
ASP2 (SCO1662 from S. coelicolor) and that both proteins likely carry out similar function.
Conclusion: Our structural data in combination with sequence analysis supports the idea that two
of the 5 actinobacteria-specific proteins, ASP1 and ASP2, mediate similar function. This function is
predicted to be novel since the structures of these proteins do not match any known protein with
or without known function. Our results suggest that this function could involve divalent metal ion
binding/transport.

Background
Actinobacteria constitute one of the main phyla within
the Bacteria and they are highly diverse in terms of their

morphology, physiology and ecology [2-5]. These bacteria
are characterized by high G+C content (greater than 55
mol%) [3,4] and a monoderm cell structure (i.e. bounded

by a single membrane)[6,7]. They include Streptomyces,
the major antibiotic producers in the pharmaceutical
industry as well as many important human, animal and
plant pathogens, such as Mycobacterium, Tropheryma,
Nocardia, Propionibacterium, Leifsonia, etc. However, except
for their clustering in the 16S rRNA tree, no molecular,
biochemical or physiological characteristics are known
that can clearly distinguish species belonging to the phylum Actinobacteria from other bacteria [8,9].
Comparative analyses of genomic sequences are enabling
identification of novel genetic characteristics that are
unique to different groups of bacteria. Large numbers of
proteins and conserved indels (inserts and deletions) that
are specific for various prokaryotic groups such as
Archaea, Chlamydiae, Bacteriodetes-Chlorobi, Proteobacteria, etc. have been identified [10-14]. Our recent comparative genomic studies on available actinobacterial
genomes have identified a large number of proteins that
are either specific for all actinobacterial species or certain
subgroups within this phylum [1]. Blast searches with
these proteins show no significant hits or similarity to any
other protein in the databases. These proteins thus provide novel and useful molecular markers for this diverse
group of bacteria [1]. Among these actinobacteria-specific
proteins, five proteins (corresponding to ML1009,
ML1306, ML1029, ML0257 and ML0642 from the
genome of Mycobacterium leprae TN) were found in every
sequenced actinobacterial species [1] including those
from the deepest branch Rubrobacter xylanophilus and also
from intracellular pathogens such as Tropheryma whipplei
which have highly reduced genomes [9,15]. All five of
these proteins are conserved within actinobacteria but
have no known function. These five actinobacteria-specific proteins are referred to in this work as ASP-1, 2, 3, 4
and 5. The simplest and most logical explanation for the
persistence of these proteins in only actinobacteria is that
their genes evolved only once in a common ancestor of all
actinobacteria and were subsequently passed on to all
their decedents. So these genes/proteins provide among
the very few molecular characteristics known that are distinctive of the Actinobacteria phylum [1,8,16,17]. In view
of their actinobacteria-specificity, it is of great interest to
determine the cellular functions of these proteins and the
cellular processes in which they participate. These studies
are expected to provide novel insights into biochemical
processes and physiological characteristics that are unique
to actinobacteria.
In an attempt to gain insight into the cellular functions of
these proteins, we have initiated structural work on these
5 actinobacteria-specific proteins. We report here the crystal structure of SCO1997 from S. coelicolor, which corresponds to the protein ML1009 from M. leprae (ASP1) [1].
Structural and phylogenetic analysis indicates that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/9/40

although ASP1 retains a similar overall fold compared to
members of the hydrolase superfamily such as purine
nucleoside phosphorylase, the active site region and
therefore function of ASP1 are distinct [18,19]. Comparison of the most highly conserved sequences of ASP1 from
different actinobacteria with their positions in the crystal
structure reveals a potential role for ASP1 in binding and
transport of divalent metal ion. Interestingly, additional
sequence and structural analyses show that another actinobacteria-specific protein ASP2 (SCO1662; ML1306) is
evolutionarily and functionally related to ASP1 [1].

Results and discussion
Crystal Structure of ASP1 from S. coelicolor
The protein ASP-1 is of hypothetical or unknown function. The genes involved in related functions (e.g. those
that are part of an operon) are generally clustered in various species or closely related species. Thus, genetic linkage
studies can often provide valuable clues regarding possible cellular function of a given gene/protein [20-22].
Hence, we have examined the neighboring genes of ASP1
in various sequenced actinobacteria. The genes flanking
ASP1 in different actinobacterial genomes are either of
unknown function or perform unrelated functions. The
information for these flanking genes is presented in the
Additional file 1 and it provides no clue regarding the possible cellular function of this protein.

To gain insight into the cellular function of ASP1, we have
cloned, expressed and crystallized the gene for this protein
from S. coelicolor A3(2) [1]. The Gene ID and accession
numbers of this protein from other actinobacterial
genomes are provided in the Additional file 2. The crystal
structure of full length ASP1 was determined using
Seleno-methionine (SeMet) derivatized ASP1 and single
anomalous diffraction (SAD) techniques. The final model
was refined with native data (2.2 ) to R and Rfree values of
17.4% and 23.4%, respectively. The structure of ASP1
contained three regions that were unable to be traced into
electron density and therefore not included in the final
model. These disordered regions included the first 2 residues at the N-terminus, the last 36 C-terminal residues
(amino acids 277–312) as well as a short loop region
encompassing residues 168–172. A complete list of data
collection and model refinement statistics can be found in
Table 1.
Crystals grew in space group I23 and contained a single
copy of ASP1 in the asymmetric unit. Upon inspection of
crystallographic packing interactions it appeared that
ASP1 might exist as a trimer. The amount of surface area
buried through the formation of an ASP1 trimer is significant at 7560 2. As well, when analyzed by size exclusion
chromatography (Figure 1), ASP1 eluted with a Stokes
radius consistent with a molecular mass equivalent to

~125 kDa (monomer 36 kDa), further supporting the idea
that ASP1 exists as a trimer in solution.
ASP1 contains a single domain comprised of a central
mixed -sheet (1–3-6-7-2-8-10-9) flanked by 4 -helices
on one side and 3 on the other yielding an overall three
layered  fold (Figure 2). Helices F and G form an
elbow-shaped extension that is peripheral to the core
domain. Based on secondary structure prediction of the
missing 36 C-terminal residues, an additional or perhaps
extended helix is expected to follow G. Trimer formation
is largely stabilized by interactions between an extended
anti-parallel hairpin (4–5) and the D region from an
adjacent monomer (Figure 2). A portion of the extended
loop (residues 175–179) preceding D further stabilizes
the trimer through interactions with 4–5, resulting in
formation of a 3-stranded anti-parallel sheet (Figure 3).
Assembly of the ASP1 trimer results in the formation of a
roughly globular complex (~diameter 70 ) with three
notable features (Figure 3). First, one side of the trimer
adopts a very flat surface, forming what could perhaps
function as a large docking interface. The electrostatic
potential on this surface is quite neutral having only a
small amount of basic potential. A second unusual feature
of the ASP1 trimer is the presence of a large internal cavity
(~7500 3) surrounded by a three-pronged claw-like structure. Given the size of this cavity and overall claw-like

structure that surrounds it, it is quite possible that this
region acts as a binding surface for another protein(s) and
or substrate. The electrostatic surface potential of each
claw is negative creating an overall acidic surface on the
internal cavity region of ASP1.
The final and most notable feature of the ASP1 trimer is
the presence of two well ordered magnesium ions (see Figure 4C for bonding distance and geometry) located at a
central pore formed along the central three fold symmetry
axis. This pore is ~20 deep and is lined by six concentric
rings of amino acids with alternating charge and polarity

third layer. Water molecules within the first hydration
shell of this metal ion are in direct van der Waals contact
with V117. Through its second hydration shell the second
Mg2+ is further stabilized by hydrogen bonding to D71
and also to the main chain carbonyl of R68. Because there
was high concentration of Mg2+ in the mother liquor
(~0.55 M), the specificity and possible role of this metal
ion-bound, channel-like pore is unclear, but may be
involved in the biological function of the ASP1 trimer.

(Figure 3 and 4A). The shape of the pore is conical and is
tapered to its narrowest point of 4.14 at D71 located
within the second layer. The first Mg2+ ion is positioned
just above a negative ring of amino acids formed by three
copies of D71 and D116 (Figure 4). Water molecules in
the first hydration shell of this metal ion are directly
hydrogen bonded to D71 (Figure 4C). A second metal ion
is located in a hydrophobic pocket lined by V117 at the

Although it is tempting to speculate that the presence of
two Mg2+ ions in the central pore region of ASP1 suggests
a role for ASP1 in metal transport, there is no direct evidence to support this idea. Furthermore, a structural comparison of ASP1 with CorA, a well characterized Mg2+
transporter whose homologs are present in S. coelicolor
and various actinobacteria [23,24], shows no obvious
similarity between these proteins (results not shown).
Therefore, if ASP1 function does involve some aspect of
Mg2+ binding and/or transporter it does not appear to be
similar to that conducted by CorA.
Structural Comparisons of ASP1
To further characterize the structure of ASP1 and gain
insight into its possible function, we performed a comparative structural analysis using the program DaliLite version 3 [25]. This analysis revealed significant structural
similarity to a homologue from Corynebacterium glutami-

cum (GeneID: Ncgl1848) [PDB: 2P90], as well as several
bacterial purine nucleoside phosphorylases and a number
of other glycosidic hydrolases from the larger NP-1 family.
Comparison of ASP1 from S. coelicolor and C. glutamicum
As expected, structural comparison of ASP1 from S. coelicolor and C. glutamicum showed a high degree of conservation (root mean square deviation (RMSD): 1.6 ).
Importantly, the structure of ASP1 from C. glutamicum
crystallized as a trimer that is identical to the trimer
reported here for ASP1 from S. coelicolor. This finding,
along with our gel filtration data, provides additional support for the trimeric structure of ASP1 generated through
crystallographic symmetry. Another important observation from the comparison of the structure from C. glutamicum is the structural conservation of the metal binding
pore despite the absence of bound metal ion. The fact that
the pore region adopts an identical structure even when a
metal ion is not present provides strong evidence to suggest that the binding of metal is not simply required for
structure integrity of the ASP1 trimer.

A comprehensive sequence alignment of ASP1 homologues from a broad range of actinobacterial species (Figure 5 and Additional file 3) clearly demonstrates that
residues contributing to the formation of two distinct
regions (the central pore and C-terminal elbow) within
the structure of ASP1 represent the most highly conserved
sequence of the protein (Figure 6). Figure 6 illustrates the
importance of conserved residues (absolutely conserved
in purple, highly conserved in yellow) in forming the pore
and elbow regions. While most of these residues are
involved in structural stabilization others, such as D71
and L268, are not. As suggested elsewhere, absolutely conserved amino acids that do not directly contribute to structure stability and are solvent exposed, are expected to
define key regions for protein function [26-29]. At this
point it is difficult to infer what function the elbow region
might serve. Given its distal location, however, it seems
likely to mediate interaction with other proteins or perhaps the missing C-terminal region of ASP1. The C-terminal region of ASP1 contains a number of highly conserved
residues (I296, E302, F304, L305). Interestingly, this
region is not observed in either of the currently available
structures suggesting that it may only become ordered
upon binding another molecule.
Comparison of ASP1 and PNP
As mentioned above, comparative structural analysis
revealed significant similarity (Z score ~10) between ASP1
and members of the NP-1 family of nucleoside phosphorylase enzymes. This family of enzymes participates in the
salvage pathway of purines and pyrimidines biosynthesis
and catalyzes the reversible phosphorolysis of purine and
pyrimidine nucleosides [18,19]. The NP-1 family member

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/9/40

that shares greatest structural similarity to ASP1 is purine
nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) from E. coli [PDB:
1ECP]. Despite having very low sequence similarity (8%
identity), ASP1 and PNPE. coli structures could be aligned
with an overall RMSD of ~3.0 . With the exception of a few
insertions and deletions, these proteins share identical
overall topology (Figure 7). Two notable insertions
include: the C-terminal highly conserved elbow (F-G)
and the extended arm region (4–5) essential for ASP1
trimer stability. In addition, there is an insertion of
sequence that significantly increases the loop size between
B-3, occluding much of the normal PNP substratebinding surface (Figure 7C). While these insertions are
expected to contribute to ASP1 function and certainly
quaternary structure, members of the NP-1 family are
characterized by different oligomeric arrangements ranging from dimer, to trimer and in some instances hexameric structures. Therefore, these observed differences do
not necessarily preclude shared function between PNP
and ASP1.
In contrast, the following evidence strongly suggests that
ASP1 does not function as a nucleoside phosphorylase.
First, a large region of PNP responsible for forming an
entire side of its active site cleft (residues ~100–180
encompassing 7–8–9 and C-D-E; Figure 7B) is completely missing in the ASP1 structure, rendering ASP1
incompatible of binding nucleoside. Second, a sequence
alignment (Additional file 3) of ASP1 homologues fails to
identify any of the highly conserved residues involved in
substrate binding or catalysis within the NP-1 family. Furthermore, from sequence and structural alignments it is
equally clear that those regions of ASP1 which are most
highly conserved, are not present within NP-1 family
members. Finally, a PNP homologue in the S. coelicolor
genome has already been identified (SCO4917) and
shows no significant similarity to ASP1. Taken together,
the observations from both sequence and structural comparison indicate that while ASP1 and PNP share similar
overall structure and topology, their functions are different.
Phylogenetic Analysis of ASP1 and ASP2
Of the five actinobacteria-specific genes previously identified through comparative genomic analysis of 19 actinobacterial species, two genes ASP1 (SCO1997; ML1009)
and ASP2 (SCO1662; ML1306) appear to encode structurally related proteins [1]. These proteins have comparable
length and share significant sequence similarity (25%
identity and 43% similarity). The question remains, are
these two conserved actinobacteria-specific proteins functionally related?

We have conducted a search for ASP1 and ASP2 homologues in all available sequenced actinobacterial genomes

Phylogenetic tree of ASP1 and ASP2 homologous genes in different actinobacterial species
Phylogenetic tree of ASP1 and ASP2 homologous genes in different actinobacterial species. The gene ID in blue
are from these genomes which only contain one of the two paralogous genes. The representing genomes of each gene ID are
listed in Additional file 2. The bootstrap scores >50% are indicated on various branch points.

(61 strains). Interestingly, while most actinobacterial species contain homologues of both ASP1 and ASP2, some
species contain only one homologue. The single homologue by definition shares similarity to both ASP1 and
ASP2 (see Additional file 2). Species (18 in total), which
only contain one homologue, are found in 7 divergent
genera (Corynebacterium, Actinomyces, Saccharopolyspora,
Brevibacterium, Bifidobacterium, Tropheryma and Rubrobacter). Further phylogenetic analysis of ASP1 and ASP2
homologues from different actinobacterial species was
conducted to determine how these two genes are related.
In the phylogenetic tree shown in Figure 8, two distinct
clusters are observed with a strong bootstrap score (98%)
indicating that the observed branch pattern is highly reliable. One cluster collected all genes homologous to ASP2
while the other cluster, grouped only those genes homologous to ASP1. The genes from the 18 species containing

only one homologue do not form a third branch, but
rather fall into either the ASP1 and ASP2 clusters. The two
distinct clusters observed in the phylogenetic tree suggest
that ASP1 and ASP2 are paralogues that evolved from a
gene duplication event in a common ancestor of actinobacteria. Therefore, most members from this phylum contain both ASP1 and ASP2 except those species, which have
lost one copy later in the evolutionary process. The fact
that ASP1 and ASP2 are paralogues, yet either can be lost,
suggests that these two paralogues perform similar functions. Based on their sequence and functional similarity,
these two proteins are also expected to share significant
structural similarity. Preliminary X-ray crystallographic
analysis indicates that the tertiary and quaternary structure of ASP2 is in fact similar to ASP1 (data not shown).

Sequence alignment of ASP1 and ASP2 homologues demonstrate that important residues which are highly conserved in ASP1 homologues and likely involved in protein
function are also conserved in ASP2 homologues (Additional file 4). As highlighted in Additional file 4, 8 of the
15 absolutely conserved residues from ASP1 homologues
are also absolutely conserved amongst ASP2 homologues.
The remaining 7 are still highly conserved and are only
substituted with similar amino acids (Additional file 4).
This finding further underscores the importance of these
residues in mediating the function of both paralogs. As
stated earlier, amino acids that fall within the category of
absolutely conserved and solvent exposed are particularly
predictive of regions important for mediating interactions
with other functionally important molecules [26-29].
D71 is most interesting in this regard because it not only
fits this category, but is also found bound to two magnesium ions in the ASP1 structure. We know that the binding of magnesium is not required for overall structural
stability since the structure of ASP1 from C. glutamicum
does not contain metal ion. The precise function of this
region within ASP1 and ASP2 will require further investigation.

Conclusion
The Actinobacteria phylum represents one of the largest
groups of bacteria. Amazingly this diverse collection of
bacteria can be characterized genetically to a first approximation by the presence of only 5 unique genes. All of
these 5 genes, are of unknown function but they are
expected to encode for function(s) that ultimately control
actinobacteria-specific and important biological process(es). Understanding the cellular function of a protein
of unknown function is not a straightforward task [20,30].
However, structure determination often provides the
most useful information in this regard [20,30]. In this
work, we report the structure of the first actinobacteriaspecific protein. Our structural data in combination with
sequence analysis further supports the idea that this protein carries out a novel function. This function is novel in
the sense that the structure of this protein does not match
any known protein, with or without known function.
Given the immense number of structures that are now
available and the wide coverage of function, it is reasonable to propose that ASP1 may mediate a function highly
specific to Actinobacteria. Although it is unclear from the
structural data alone, it seems possible that ASP1 function
may involve some aspect of divalent metal ion interaction. It will be intriguing to determine what contribution,
if any, this highly conserved 'pore' region makes toward
ASP1 function. Our phylogenetic analysis also shows that
another actinobacteria-specific protein ASP2, which is a
paralogue of ASP1, may also have similar structure and
function. Future genetic and biochemical studies of these
proteins is therefore of great interest in linking the conser-

vation of the biology of actinobacteria and their 5 unique
genes.

Methods
Protein Expression and Purification
The ASP1 gene (SCO1997) from S. coelicolor A3(2) was
cloned into the pET-22b vector and expressed in E. coli
BL21(DE3) as a full length recombinant protein with a Cterminal (His)6-tag. SeMet protein was expressed in the
methionine auxotroph E. coli B834 using a previously
described method [31]. For expression of both native and
SeMet derivatized ASP1, cells were grown at 37°C to an
OD600 of ~0.6; induced with 1 mM isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG); harvested after 4 h; resuspended in a binding buffer containing 20 mM Tris, pH
7.4, 500 mM NaCl and 10 mM imidazole; lysed in a
French pressure cell; and clarified by centrifugation.
Supernatant was loaded on a 1 mL Ni-column, and
washed with 200 mL binding buffer along with 36 mM
imidazole, and finally eluted at 300 mM imidazole. The
eluted proteins were diluted 5 fold with buffer A (20 mM
Tris, pH 7.5) and loaded onto a 5 mL HiTrap Q HP anion
exchange column (Amersham) for further purification.
Proteins were eluted with a 120 mL linear gradient from
50 to 500 mM NaCl. ASP1 eluted as a single peak at ~260
mM NaCl. Individual fractions from across the peak were
pooled and buffer exchanged into a low-salt buffer (25
mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5) for crystallization. The
buffer used for gel filtration chromatography contained
20 mM Tris (pH 7.4) and 200 mM KCl.
Crystallization and Data Collection of ASP1
All crystals were grown at 17°C using the hanging drop/
vapour diffusion method. Hanging drops containing 1 uL
of protein solution (5 mg/mL) and 1 uL of mother liquor
(0.1 M MES, 0.55 M magnesium formate, pH6.5~6.8,
0.25~0.5% n-Octyl-beta-D-glucoside, 0~1.5% glycerol)
were dehydrated over a reservoir containing 800 uL of 1.5
M (NH4)2SO4. Cubic shaped crystals (100 × 100 × 100
m3), suitable for data collection, grew after approximately 3 days incubation. Crystals were flash frozen
directly in a nitrogen cold stream (100 K) with no further
cryo-protection. Diffraction data sets for native and SeMet
crystals were collected at wavelengths of 1.1 and 0.979 Å,
respectively. All data was collected at the X25 beamline
using an ADSC Q315 CCD x-ray detector (NSLS,
Brookhaven, NY).
Structure Determination and Model Refinement
SAD data collected to 2.0 Å was processed using d*TREK
[32]. All 5 of the expected SeMet sites were located using
HYSS [33,34]. Phasing and density modification were carried out using CNS [35]. Iterative rounds of manual
model building and refinement were performed with
Coot and REFMAC5 until R and Rfree values converged and

could no longer be improved [36,37]. The coordinates of
the final ASP1 model were deposited in the Protein Data
Bank under accession code 3E35. Surface area calculations
were performed using the program PISA version 1.15 [38].
Structure similarity searches were performed by DaliLite
program v3 [25]. Structural illustrations presented in figures were generated with PyMOL [39].
Phylogenetic Analysis
Phylogenetic analyses were carried out based on sequence
alignments for ASP1 and ASP2 homologous genes from
18 actinobacterial species. Among these selected species,
only 8 contain one of the two genes, while the others contain both gene copies. Multiple sequence alignments were
created using the ClustalX version 1.83 [40]. The alignment was then imported into TREE-PUZZLE version 5.2
for maximum-likelihood (ML) analysis using the WAG+F
model with gamma distribution of evolutionary rates
with four categories [41,42].
