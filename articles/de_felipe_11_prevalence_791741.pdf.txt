Abstract
Background: Most of the non-B HIV-1 subtypes are predominant in Sub-Saharan Africa and India although they
have been found worldwide. In the last decade, immigration from these areas has increased considerably in Spain.
The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of non-B subtypes circulating in a cohort of HIV-1infected immigrants in Seville, Southern Spain and to identify drug resistance-associated mutations.
Methods: Complete protease and first 220 codons of the reverse transcriptase coding regions were amplified and
sequenced by population sequencing. HIV-1 subtypes were determined using Stanford University Drug Resistance
Database, and phylogenetic analysis was performed comparing multiple reported sequences. Drug resistance
mutations were defined according to the International AIDS Society-USA.
Results: From 2000 to 2010 a total of 1,089 newly diagnosed HIV-1-infected patients were enrolled in our cohort.
Of these, 121 were immigrants, of which 98 had ethical approval and informed consent to include in our study.
Twenty-nine immigrants (29/98, 29.6%) were infected with non-B subtypes, of which 15/29 (51.7%) were CRF02-AG,
mostly from Sub-Saharan Africa, and 2/29 (6.9%) were CRF01-AE from Eastern Europe. A, C, F, J and G subtypes
from Eastern Europe, Central-South America and Sub-Saharan Africa were also present. Some others harboured
recombinant forms CRF02-AG/CRF01-AE, CRF2-AG/G and F/B, B/C, and K/G, in PR and RT-coding regions. Patients
infected with non-B subtypes showed a high frequency of minor protease inhibitor resistance mutations, M36I,
L63P, and K20R/I. Only one patient, CRF02_AG, showed major resistance mutation L90M. Major RT inhibitor
resistance mutations K70R and A98G were present in one patient with subtype G, L100I in one patient with
CRF01_AE, and K103N in another patient with CRF01_AE. Three patients had other mutations such as V118I, E138A
and V90I.
Conclusions: The circulation of non-B subtypes has significantly increased in Southern Spain during the last
decade, with 29.6% prevalence, in association with demographic changes among immigrants. This could be an
issue in the treatment and management of these patients. Resistance mutations have been detected in these
patients with a prevalence of 7% among treatment-naïve patients compared with the 21% detected among
patients under HAART or during treatment interruption.

Background
Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is the
major pathogen responsible for the AIDS pandemic. Several genetic variants can be recognized within HIV-1
group M, including nine subtypes (A through K), at least
43 major circulating recombinants forms (CRFs), and multiple unique recombinant forms (URFs) (http://www.hiv.
lanl.gov). The prevalence of HIV-1 subtypes varies greatly
depending on the geographic region. Subtype B is predominant in North America and Western Europe, including
Spain, although is responsible for only 10% of global infections [1]. Non-B HIV-1 subtypes and its recombinants,
such as subtype C, A, CRF01_AE or CRF02_AG, are prevalent in Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia and Eastern Europe [2].
These subtypes cause up to 90% of the 36 million estimated infections, playing an important role in the HIV-1
pandemic [3,4]. Human migration produced in the last
decade has contributed to the current spread of non-B
subtypes in developed countries [5-7].
The extensive variability of HIV-1 has a potential
impact on epidemiology, diagnosis, therapy and prevention of infection. In fact, faster progression to AIDS
among individuals infected with non-B subtypes or
recombinant variants enhances the importance of identifying these strains [8,9]. In addition, differences in the
sensitivity to antiretrovirals in patients infected with
non-B subtypes due to the high prevalence of polymorphisms in protease (PR) and/or reverse transcriptase
(RT) associated with resistance to antiretroviral therapy
has to be taken into account [10-16].
Finally, diagnostic tests, including viral load measurements, might be affected by the diversity of HIV-1
strains [17,18]. Therefore, HIV-1 subtype characterization is becoming an important aspect to adequate clinical management of HIV-1-infected individuals [3]. SubSaharan population in Spain has increased in recent
years. Around 10-15% of HIV-1-infected immigrants are
characterized with non-B subtype during the first medical evaluation [19-21].
Thus, the objective of this study was to analyse the
prevalence of non-B subtypes in a cohort of HIV-1infected immigrants in Southern Spain from 2000 to
2010, and to characterize drug resistance mutations
associated to PR and RT.
Methods
Patients

From January 2000 to December 2010 a total of 1,089
new HIV-1-infected patients were included in the
dynamic open cohort of the Infectious Diseases Service
at the University Hospital Virgen del Rocio located in
Seville, Southern Spain. Of these, 121 (11.1%) were
HIV-1 infected immigrants. For the present retrospective study, immigrant patients of any nationality with

Page 2 of 7

available samples were selected. The study was approved
by the Ethical Committee of the Hospital. A total of 98
patients were included and all signed an informed
consent.
Laboratory determinations

CD4+ T cell count was determined in fresh samples by
flow cytometry. Plasma HIV-1 RNA was measured by
quantitative PCR (HIV Monitor™ Test Kit, Roche
Molecular System, Hoffman-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. This
assay has a lower detection limit of 50 HIV-1 RNA
copies/ml.
Subtyping and drug resistance profile

For genetic analysis, in patients with detectable viral
load, HIV-1 RNA was extracted from plasma using a
viral RNA purification kit (Qiagen, Diagnostics, Barcelona, Spain). cDNA was synthesized by avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) reverse transcriptase. In patients with
undetectable viral load and undergoing antiretroviral
treatment at the time of the study, HIV-1 proviral DNA
from cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) isolated from heparinized blood by Ficoll density-gradient centrifugation, were used for DNA extraction (Qiagen DNA blood kit, Diagnostics, Barcelona,
Spain), following the manufacturer’s instructions.
PCR reactions were carried out in 50 μL final volumes
containing 10 mM Tris HCl pH 8.8, 50 mM KCl, 1.5
mM MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0,2 mM of each dNTP,
0.7 units Taq polymerase (Eurotaq, Euroclone, S.p.A,
Syziano, Italy), 0.5 μM of each primer, and 1 μg purified
DNA. Cycling parameters were 94°C for 5 min followed
by 35 cycles of 94°C for 15 s, 55°C for 15 s and 72°C for
30 s, followed by a 10 min hold at 72°C. Identical conditions were used for the nested PCR. Outer primers
PRF2 (5’-cagaagagagtctcaggtttggg-3’) and PRF5 (5’-tggagtattgtatggattttcagg-3’) for the PR-coding region, and
47RV (5’-gtattagtaggacctacacct-3’) and Pol18 (5’-agactcacaatatgca-3’) for the RT-coding region, were used. Inner
primers Pol10 (5’-ccctcaagggcaggagc-3’) and Pol14 (5’gggccatccattcctgg-3’) for the PR-coding region, and A35
(5’-ttggttgcactttaaattttcccattagtcctatt-3’) and Lp2 (5’atcaggatgagattcataacccatcca-3’) for RT-coding region,
were used. A fragment of 450 bp encompassing the
entire PR-coding region and a fragment of 670 bp that
includes the first 220 codons of the RT-coding region
were generated by nested PCR.
Sequencing of PCR purified amplicons was performed
using Applied Biosystems 310 Sequencer and BigDye
deoxy terminator procedure as specified by the
manufacturer.
Subtyping of the PR and RT sequences was determined using the Stanford University Drug Resistance

de Felipe et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:416
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/416

Database (http://hivdb.stanford.edu). Afterwards, the PR
and RT sequences were aligned together with other
HIV-1 group M reported sequences available in the
GenBank by computer software CLUSTAL W. Phylogenetic trees were generated using the Neighbour-Joining
method and bootstrap re-sampling of multiple alignments (1,000 data sets), included in the CLC DNA
Workbench software, was employed to test the tree
robustness. Drug resistance profiles in PR and RT-coding regions were defined according to the International
AIDS Society-USA.

North America (United States), and Asia (India). The
largest immigrant group in Southern Spain was from
Central-South America (47/98, 47.9%). In most cases,
these individuals were infected with HIV-1 before moving to Spain.
The proportion of immigrants in our cohort of HIV-1infected patients from 2000 to 2010 is shown in Figure
1. The proportion has been rising year by year from
2.1% in 2000 to around 12% in 2010. Notably, there has
been a marked progressive increase up to 2008, which
exceeded 20% (Figure 1). Regarding risk behaviour,
injecting drug use was the most common route of transmission among native Spanish patients (around 40% vs.
7% among immigrants, p < 0.001 Chi Square test), while
sexual transmission (hetero plus homosexual) was predominant (80% vs. 42% among native Spanish patients,
p < 0.001 Chi Square test) among immigrants (Figure 1).

Results and discussion
Patients’ characteristics

Subtype analysis

Baseline characteristics of the 98 immigrant individuals
studied are summarized in Table 1. The study population was grouped into seven categories according to
their home countries: Central-South America (Argentina, Peru, Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, Bolivia, Ecuador, El
Salvador, Guatemala, Panama, Paraguay, Dominican
Republic and Venezuela), Western Europe (France, Italy,
Portugal, Belgium, Germany and Ireland), Sub-Saharan
Africa (Nigeria, Cameroon, Angola, Uganda, Sierra
Leone, Guinea, Cote d’Ivoire), Northern Africa (Morocco), Eastern Europe (Romania, Ukraine and Russia),

Both PR and RT sequences were obtained for 87
patients, while only PR or RT sequences were obtained
for seven and four individuals, respectively. Twenty-nine
of the overall sequences analyzed belonged to non-B
subtypes (29.6%, Table 2). These included A, C, F, G, J,
and K subtypes, and recombinant forms, such as
CRF02_AG, as well as CRF01_AE. Besides, seven
patients harbored different subtypes for each gene,
including recombinants B/C, F/B, K/G, CRF02_AG/
CRF01_AE, and CRF02_AG/G in PR and RT respectively. According to the geographical origin, the non-B

M36I mutation in protease was observed in all patients,
whilst K20I/R, L63P, V77I and L10V/I mutations were
present in 75%, 17.8%, 10.7% and 7.1% of patients,
respectively. However, only patient SE59 had the major
mutation L90M (1/28; 3.5%). This patient was infected
with the recombinant form CRF02_AG and had been
under HAART for at least two years.
On the contrary, only six patients showed RT mutations. Three of them (SE37, SE34 and SE60) showed
major RT mutations (3/28, 10.7%, table 2). Patient SE37,
naïve for antiretroviral treatment, had A98G and K70R
major mutations associated with resistance to nonnucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTI), and nucleoside RT
inhibitors (NRTI), respectively. Patient SE34, in treatment interruption, had L100I mutation associated with
NNRTI resistance, and finally patient SE60, receiving
HAART, had the NNRTI resistance mutation K103N.
Minor mutations or polymorphisms in RT were
observed in patients SE71, SE91 and SE111 i.e.: V118I,
E138A, and V90I mutations respectively.

subtype was detected in a total of 79% (15/19) of SubSaharan Africans, followed by 60% Eastern Europeans
(6/10), 20% Northern Africans (1/5), 10.6% CentralSouth Americans (5/47) and 7.1% Western Europeans
(1/14).
Phylogenetic analysis

Phylogenetic trees were generated based on PR and RT
sequences and included reference sequences representing different HIV-1 subtypes. All sequences clustered
within the correspondent subtype, which was concordant with the data provided by Stanford University (Figure 2). Only three of the RT sequences: SE16, SE113,
and SE11 corresponding to subtype G were located
slightly apart from this subtype although within the
same branch. Noteworthy, no sub-clusters were formed
based on the geographical origin of the patients.
Sequences PR_SE15, PR_SE25, PR_SE51, PR_SE55,
RT_SE14, RT_SE15, RT_SE27, RT_SE29, RT_SE45,
RT_SE79, were excluded from the phylogenetic analysis
due to the limited length that could have influenced the
analysis.
Prevalence of resistance mutations

All patients infected with non-B HIV-1 showed at least
one polymorphic mutation in PR (Table 2). Most of
these mutations have been frequently found and
reported amongst non-B HIV-1 subtypes [14,16]. The

Discussion
This study evaluates the prevalence of HIV-1 subtypes
and PR and RT drug resistance mutations among HIV1-infected immigrants living in Southern Spain. Immigration had been gradually increasing since 2000, with a
peak of 22% in 2008. Since then, it has been slowly
decreasing to 11.8% in 2010. The largest immigrant
group was form Central-South America (47.9%) most of
them infected with the HIV-1 B subtype. However, up
to 25% of immigrants were from countries where HIV-1
non-B subtypes are predominant, as Sub-Saharan Africa
with 79% of HIV-1 non-B subtypes (subtypes A, G, J or
CRF02_AG), or Eastern Europe with 60% (subtypes A,
F, CRF02_AG or CRF01_AE). This marked increase in
individuals infected with non-B HIV-1 subtype in our
society may have a direct impact on the spread of these
subtypes among Spanish native individuals in addition
to the changes in appropriate treatment regimes due to
differences in genetic sequences amongst the different
HIV-1 strains. These results are similar to those found
in studies conducted in other regions in Spain, Madrid
and Canary Islands [19,20,22].
Previous studies reported a high prevalence of minor
resistance mutations in naïve patients infected with
HIV-1 non-B subtype that could facilitate the emergence
of major mutations [16,23,24]. However, the clinical
relevance of minor mutations is unclear. Our results
indicated that patients infected with HIV-1 non-B subtypes showed a high frequency of minor PR mutations
(polymorphisms) as M36I, L63P, and K20R/I, in contrast
to the low proportion of major resistance mutations. In
fact, only one patient, subtype CRF02_AG, had L90M
mutation probably as a result of receiving antiretroviral

therapy during two years (1/28, 3.5%). No difference
between the number of patients with major or minor
RT mutations (3/28, 10.7% in both cases) was found.
Nevertheless, the proportion of patients with major RT
mutations was higher compared to patients with major
PR mutations.
It is of note that one treatment naïve patient, with G
subtype, showed major RT mutations associated with
resistance to NRTI (K70R) and NNRTI (A98G). This
patient might have acquired these resistance mutations
at the moment of infection. One limitation of our study
was the impossibility to test plasma samples of antiretroviral-experienced patients before the initiation of
antiretroviral therapy to determine primary resistance
mutations.
An increasing effort has been done to characterize
the difference in antiretroviral therapy responses
within HIV-1 non-B subtypes. Although clinical

evidence remains limited, response to antiretroviral
therapy does not appear to differ significantly among
subtypes [3]. In our study, 29 patients showed HIV-1
non-B subtype in PR and/or RT. Eleven of them were
under antiretroviral therapy and had good virological
and immunological responses. Nevertheless, larger
cohorts are necessary to confirm our results. On the
other hand, 14 immigrants infected by HIV-1 non-B
subtype were naïve for antiretroviral therapy. Most of
them with viral load around 4 log HIV-1 copies/ml,
and two patients had undetectable viral load for a long
period of time (one of them at least for one year). As
previous studies have described the failure of laboratory techniques to detect HIV-1 non-B subtypes
[25-27], however it would be interesting to establish
whether the failure of the diagnosis may be due to a
phenotype characteristic of viral load controller in this
population.

Conclusions
The circulation of HIV-1 non-B subtypes among immigrants, with a prevalence of 29.6%, has significantly
increased in Southern Spain in the last decade, in association with demographic changes. Spread of CRF02-AG, G
and F subtypes, and also some recombinant forms appear
to predominate, which is consistent with previous findings [19,20,22,28]. This fact may affect the treatment and
management of these patients, and the spread of these
subtypes among native Spanish population. Furthermore,
a low percentage of the immigrants with the non-B subtypes had major resistance mutations. Prevalence of these
resistance mutations varies from 7% among treatmentnaïve patients to 21% among patients under HAART or
during treatment interruption.
