Abstract
The descriptive distribution and phylogeny of feline coronaviruses (FCoVs) were studied in cats suspected of having feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) in Malaysia. Ascitic fluids and/or biopsy samples were subjected to a reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeted for a conserved region of 3’untranslated region (3’UTR) of
the FCoV genome. Eighty nine percent of the sampled animals were positive for the presence of FCoV. Among the
FCoV positive cats, 80% of cats were males and 64% were below 2 years of age. The FCoV positive cases included
56% domestic short hair (DSH), 40% Persian, and 4% Siamese cats. The nucleotide sequences of 10 selected amplified products from FIP cases were determined. The sequence comparison revealed that the field isolates had 96%
homology with a few point mutations. The extent of homology decreased to 93% when compared with reference
strains. The overall branching pattern of phylogenetic tree showed two distinct clusters, where all Malaysian isolates fall into one main genetic cluster. These findings provided the first genetic information of FCoV in Malaysia.
Findings
Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a highly fatal disease
of cats caused by generalized infection with a feline coronavirus (FCoV). FCoVs belong to subgroup 1a of Coronaviruses in the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales.
Other members of this subgroup include porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus, canine coronavirus, raccoon/dog coronavirus and Chinese ferret badger
coronavirus [1,2]. FCoVs are enveloped, positive-strand
RNA viruses with a large, capped and polyadenylated
RNA genome of about 29 kb. The cap structure at the
5’ end of genome is followed by an untranslated region
(UTR). At the 3’ end of the genome is another UTR of
275 nucleotides, followed by the poly (A) tail. The
sequences of the both 3’- and 5’-UTR are important for
RNA replication and transcription [3].
Two biotypes of FCoV are described in cats: feline
infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) and feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). Infection with FECV is usually unapparent or manifested by a transient gastroenteritis. In

contrast, FIPV infection causes a fatal immune-mediated
disease with a wide spectrum of clinical signs. FIP refers
to the more common effusive (wet) form of the disease
characterized by peritonitis and/or pleuritis. The effusive
form is caused by complement-mediated vasculitis and
results in inflammatory exudation into body cavities. In
some FIP cases, partial cell-mediated immunity cause
non-effusive (dry) form which is characterized by granulomatous involvement of various organs particularly
central nervous system and eyes. However, the FIP
forms can transform to each other [4-6]. It has been
suggested that virulent FIPV arises by mutation from
parental FECV in the individual, persistently infected
host [4,7,8]. It is not yet clear which alterations in the
FCoV genome are responsible for the generation of
FIPV from FECV [3,6].
FIP occurs worldwide and is ubiquitous in virtually all
cat populations [6]. The disease was reported as a major
factor of kitten mortality in UK [9] and it is currently
one of the leading infectious diseases causing death
among young cats from shelters and catteries [6].
The first case of FIP in Malaysia was reported in 1981
[10] and the feature of cats with FIP were described in a

retrospective study [11]. Antibodies against FCoVs were
found in 100% of cats living in Malaysian catteries [12]
and the virus was detected in 84% of healthy cats using
RT-PCR [13]. In present study, a conserved region of
3’untranslated region (3’UTR) is used to detect FCoV
and determine the descriptive distribution and phylogeny of local isolates in FIP-suspected cats.
Abdominal fluids and/or tissue samples of 28 cats suspected of having the effusive form of FIP were obtained
from the University Veterinary Hospital, Universiti
Putra Malaysia (UVH-UPM) over the period of three
years (2007-2009). Ascitic fluids were diluted 1:10 in
phosphate buffer solution (PBS), aliquoted and stored at
-70°C until used. Organ samples were homogenized in
1:10 of PBS. Insoluble components were removed by
centrifugation for 10 min at 3000 g and the supernatant

fraction was collected and kept at -70°C. Two FCoV
reference strains (FECV 79-1683; ATCC® No.VR-989™
and FIPV79-1146; ATCC® No. VR-216™) were used for
RT-PCR optimization. Virus stocks were propagated in
confluent Crandell Feline Kidney cells. The viruses were
harvested when the infected cells showed 80% cytopathic effects. The virus suspension was freezed-thawed
three times and stored at -70°C until used.
RNA was extracted from the infected cell culture
supernatants and clinical samples using TRIZOL®
Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The partial
3’UTR was amplified by RT-PCR using previously
described primers [7]. One-step RT-PCR was performed
using Access RT-PCR System and RNasin® Ribonuclease
Inhibitor (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, USA). The

reaction was optimized on a thermal cycler (MJ
Research, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). PCR products
of 223 bp were analyzed using electrophoresis on a 2%
agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide and
observed under UV light. PCR products of 10 positive
cases were selected randomly, purified using PCR SV
protocol (GENEALL®, Seoul, South Korea) and
sequenced in both direction with the primers (Medigene, Selangor, Malaysia).
Data analysis was performed using Statistical Tables
Calculator, which is available online at http://faculty.vassar.edu/lowry/odds2x2.html. Age, breed and gender differences were compared by calculating positivity rate,
odds and 95% confidence intervals.
The RT-PCR assay amplified the target band in 25 out
of 28 cats’ samples (89%). Although, the PCR results
must be interpreted in conjunction with clinical or
pathological findings, detection of the virus in FIP-suspected cats may be useful to confirm FIP. Since FCoVs
are ubiquitous in cats with high seroprevalence [5,6,12],
PCR provides the obvious advantage over serology by
directly detecting FCoV genome rather than documenting a previous immune system encounter with the coronavirus. The primers of this PCR assay were chosen
from a highly conserved region of 3’UTR of the FCoV
genome to detect most, if not all of the FCoV strains.
The usefulness of these primers for a general screening
test has been reported previously [14-16].
FCoV-positivity rate in cats younger than two years
old (64%) was higher than older cats, but they are not
significant. However, the result is consistent with other
studies demonstrating higher incidence of FIP in cats
below 2 years of age [5,11,14] and agree with the fact
that FIP is a disease of young cats. Typical clinical cases
are first appear during the postweaning period, but most
deaths from FIP occur in cats 3-16 months of age [6].
Most of the FCoV-positive cats in our study were
males (80%). Higher incidence of FIP among males was

previously reported [14,17,18]. As the pathogenesis of
the disease is still not fully understood, the relation of
gender and incidence of FIP is not clear.
About 56% of FCoV-positive cases were DSH, 40%
Persian, and 4% Siamese cats. In the present study, the
majority of cats (96%) diagnosed with FIP were DSH or
Persian. This finding is in accordance with a previous
report on FIP in Malaysia showing that 69.7% and 27.3%
of cats diagnosed with FIP were DSH and Persian cats,
respectively [11]. However, these studies did not conclude that these two breeds were more susceptible to
FIP because of limited variation in cat breeds presented
at UVH-UPM and lack of clinical cases of FIP in different breeds in Malaysia. Furthermore, in a study on the
prevalence of FIP in specific cat breeds, DSH and Persian cats were at low risk compared to others [18]. Age,

breed and gender distribution in FCoV-positive cats are
shown in Figure 1 and statistical analysis is summarized
in Table 1.
Out of 25 PCR positive cases, 10 isolates were selected
for further sequence analyses. All 10 field isolates designated as UPM1C/07 to UPM10C/09 with accession no.
FJ897745 to FJ897754, respectively were deposited in
the GeneBank (Table 2). These sequences were aligned
with published sequences of FCoV using ClustalW Multiple alignment (Bioedit version 7.0.9). The sequences of
four Malaysian FCoV isolates which have been isolated
from healthy cats in a previous study [19] were also
included in the alignment (Table 2). Homology matrix
and phylogenetic trees were constructed using Neighbor-Joining method (Bioedit) and TreeTop-Phylogenetic
Tree Prediction (GeneBee-Molecular Biology Server

available at http://www.genebee.msu.su). The phylogenetic trees were displayed in PHYLIP format including
bootstrap values.
The sequences of ten local isolates showed 96%
homology and when compared to published sequences
of FCoV, the homology decreased to 93%. The homology between partial sequences of FCoV isolates from
Malaysia were higher than those from different geographical origin (32 strains from USA, 13 strains from
Netherlands, two strains from Taiwan, and one strain
from UK). These findings support previous observations
showing a correlation between different FCoV biotypes
with similar geographic background [8].
Multiple sequence alignment showed a few point
mutations and single-nucleotide deletions in the
sequences of local isolates (Figure 2). These findings
indicate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in
FCoVs as described previously [6,20]. No particular pattern of mutation or deletion was found in this part of
FCoVs genome.
Phylogenetic tree constructed by cluster algorithm
showed that the sequences were genetically separated in
two distinct clusters; all local sequences fell into one main
cluster and suggested they may derived from a common
ancestor (Figure 3). However, a whole genome sequence is
needed to determine genetic pattern of Malaysian FCoVs.
Phylogenetic tree constructed by neighbor-joining method
showed the phylogenetic relations of the sequences in an
unrooted-tree algorithm (Figure 4).
In conclusion, the present study indicated that males
and young cats are more likely to be diagnosed with
FIP. The homology of partial sequences of 3’UTR of
FCoV isolates in Malaysia was shown to be higher than
those from the other regions.
