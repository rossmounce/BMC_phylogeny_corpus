Unprecedented loss of ammonia assimilation
capability in a urease-encoding bacterial
mutualist
Laura E Williams1, Jennifer J Wernegreen1,2*

Abstract
Background: Blochmannia are obligately intracellular bacterial mutualists of ants of the tribe Camponotini.
Blochmannia perform key nutritional functions for the host, including synthesis of several essential amino acids. We
used Illumina technology to sequence the genome of Blochmannia associated with Camponotus vafer.
Results: Although Blochmannia vafer retains many nutritional functions, it is missing glutamine synthetase (glnA), a
component of the nitrogen recycling pathway encoded by the previously sequenced B. floridanus and B.
pennsylvanicus. With the exception of Ureaplasma, B. vafer is the only sequenced bacterium to date that encodes
urease but lacks the ability to assimilate ammonia into glutamine or glutamate. Loss of glnA occurred in a deletion
hotspot near the putative replication origin. Overall, compared to the likely gene set of their common ancestor, 31
genes are missing or eroded in B. vafer, compared to 28 in B. floridanus and four in B. pennsylvanicus. Three genes
(queA, visC and yggS) show convergent loss or erosion, suggesting relaxed selection for their functions. Eight B.
vafer genes contain frameshifts in homopolymeric tracts that may be corrected by transcriptional slippage. Two of
these encode DNA replication proteins: dnaX, which we infer is also frameshifted in B. floridanus, and dnaG.
Conclusions: Comparing the B. vafer genome with B. pennsylvanicus and B. floridanus refines the core genes
shared within the mutualist group, thereby clarifying functions required across ant host species. This third genome
also allows us to track gene loss and erosion in a phylogenetic context to more fully understand processes of
genome reduction.

Background
Candidatus Blochmannia species (hereafter, Blochmannia) are obligately intracellular, primary mutualists of
ants belonging to the tribe Camponotini [1,2]. Blochmannia have been found in every species of Camponotus surveyed to date, as well as other genera within
Camponotini, suggesting an ancient and stable association with the ant tribe [3]. The nutritional basis of the
symbiosis was first suggested by the location of Blochmannia in specialized host cells intercalated among
epithelial cells in the insect midgut [4,5]. Genome
sequencing of B. floridanus and B. pennsylvanicus
revealed biosynthetic pathways for all essential amino
acids except arginine, further supporting the hypothesis

that Blochmannia provides important nutritional functions to the ant host [6,7]. The symbiont also recycles
nitrogen from urea into glutamine via the activity of
urease and glutamine synthetase [8], which are encoded
by the two previously published Blochmannia genomes
[6,7]. Urease hydrolyzes urea to ammonia and carbon
dioxide, and glutamine synthetase assimilates nitrogen
from ammonia into glutamine, which feeds into other
amino acid biosynthetic pathways [9]. This process may
consume the nitrogenous waste products of the ant host
and also urea in animal or bird waste collected and
ingested by some Camponotus species [8].
Similar to other primary obligate mutualists of insects,
Blochmannia genomes are extremely reduced in size
(705-792 kb), show strong AT bias (27-29.5% GC content), and undergo accelerated rates of molecular evolution [6,7,10]. Comparative analyses of Buchnera, the
primary mutualist of aphids, suggest that ongoing

genome reduction proceeds primarily as a gradual erosion of individual genes, rather than by punctuated
losses of large DNA segments encoding multiple genes
[11]. Comparisons of the B. floridanus and B. pennsylvanicus genomes indicate a similar phenomenon in Blochmannia [7]. The accumulation of substitutions, small
indels and frameshift errors slowly degrades genes, and
the resulting pseudogenes are gradually eliminated from
the genome by the underlying deletional bias in bacteria
[12]. The complement of genes lost by an endosymbiont
genome is determined in part by chance events, such as
the fixation of deleterious mutations due to small effective population sizes, and by the historical contingencies
of gene loss in ancestral genomes, which influence the
strength of selective pressure on remaining genes [13].
Independent loss of the same gene from multiple
lineages would suggest relaxed selection on gene function, rather than stochastic effects of drift.
The AT mutational bias observed in obligate intracellular symbionts results in a high density of homopolymeric tracts of adenines or thymines in the genome,
with some tracts as long as 12 bp. These polyA or
polyT tracts are prone to polymerase slippage during
replication, which can introduce frameshift errors in the
gene. In some cases, such frameshifts may constitute the
initial events of gene erosion, leading to accumulation of
mutations and eventual degradation to a pseudogene
[14]. However, some frameshifts are conserved among
geographically disparate symbiont populations and even
between different species, with no detectable degradation of the gene [15,16]. Full-length, functional protein
products are generated from these frameshifted genes as
a result of transcriptional slippage in the homopolymeric
tract, which produces a mixed mRNA pool of full-length
and frameshifted transcripts [15].
To better understand the nutritional symbiosis
between Blochmannia and Camponotini and processes
of genome reduction in this endosymbiont, it is essential
to compare multiple genomes. Expanding the set of
completed Blochmannia genomes may shed light on the
‘core’ genes shared across Blochmannia and refine our
knowledge of the functions that are required in this
symbiosis. Comparing multiple genomes within this
group can also clarify the Blochmannia pan-genome and
let us reconstruct the likely gene content of ancestral
genomes, thereby elucidating patterns of gene loss and
erosion. Finally, analysis of Blochmannia genomes from
different Camponotus host species may help us understand how this symbiosis evolves in diverse hosts that
occupy different habitats and geographic ranges.
Here, we use Illumina technology to sequence the
genome of Blochmannia vafer, the endosymbiont of
Camponotus vafer. The addition of this genome to the
two previously sequenced Blochmannia genomes lets us

investigate genomic changes in a phylogenetic context.
Also, C. vafer occupies a different habitat and geographic range compared to C. floridanus and C. pennsylvanicus. Whereas C. pennsylvanicus is widespread
throughout much of the eastern and central United
States, and C. floridanus is distributed throughout the
southeastern United States as well as Central and South
America [17], C. vafer is found in a more restricted
range in the southwestern United States and northeastern Mexico [18]. Completion of the B. vafer genome
allows us to investigate the nature of the mutualism in
ecologically distinct Camponotus species.

Results
Shared Blochmannia genes include urease gene cluster

The B. vafer genome shares many features with the B.
pennsylvanicus and B. floridanus genomes, including
reduced size and low %GC content (Table 1). Genes
shared among the three Blochmannia include 617 intact
genes, 575 of which are protein-coding (Figure 1). For
the purposes of these comparisons of functional capabilities, we include as ‘intact’ those genes that contain a
single indel within a homopolymeric tract, since the
reading frame may be restored via transcriptional slippage [15]. B. vafer, B. floridanus and B. pennsylvanicus
encode the same set of DNA replication proteins and
ribosomal proteins, with the exception of the 50 S ribosomal protein RpmD, which is absent in B. pennsylvanicus. All three Blochmannia encode the same pathways
for essential amino acid biosynthesis and sulfate assimilation, the latter of which contributes to cysteine biosynthesis. A urease gene cluster, which includes the
structural genes ureABC and the accessory genes

Figure 1 Comparison of intact genes encoded by three
Blochmannia genomes. To highlight potential metabolic
differences among genomes, only intact genes are shown. These
include protein-coding and RNA-coding genes. Eroded
pseudogenes in a given genome are considered missing due to
loss of function. Genes with a single frameshift in a polyA or polyT
tract are considered intact for this purpose, because transcriptional
slippage may restore expression of a full-length protein product. In
this comparison, yidC and yidD in B. floridanus are counted as a
single gene, due to fusion in B. pennsylvanicus and B. vafer.

ureDFG [19], is also present in all three genomes. Gene
order and strand orientation is strictly conserved along
all three Blochmannia genomes. The set of genes
encoded by each Blochmannia genome is listed in Additional File 1.
Loss of glutamine synthetase in B. vafer

The most recent common ancestor of all three Blochmannia had at least 660 genes (Figure 1). This reconstruction considers only genes that are intact in at least
one of the genomes (the uvrD pseudogene found in
B. pennsylvanicus is therefore not included). At least 31
genes were lost or eroded along the branches leading
from the common ancestor to B. vafer, compared to 28
genes for B. floridanus and four for B. pennsylvanicus.
Twelve genes are missing or eroded only in B. vafer
(Figure 1). Of these, glutamine synthetase (glnA) is perhaps the most startling. We confirmed the absence of
glnA in Blochmannia from eight additional C. vafer
colonies by Sanger sequencing of this region. The
sequences were identical, with the exception of one substitution and three indels. Analysis of the trpE gene
encoded by B. vafer revealed three distinct genotypes,
demonstrating that glnA is missing from different
B. vafer strains.
In other Blochmannia species, Class I glutamine
synthetase is thought to act in concert with the urease
gene cluster (ureDABCFG) to recycle nitrogen into
amino acid biosynthesis [8]. Urease converts urea to

carbon dioxide and ammonia, the latter of which is then
assimilated into glutamine by glutamine synthetase.
Despite losing glnA, B. vafer retains ureDABCFG, which
have high amino acid sequence identity (53-80%) to the
B. floridanus urease proteins. Loss of glutamine synthetase in B. vafer disrupts the ammonia assimilation step
of nitrogen recycling. In E. coli, glutamate dehydrogenase (gdhA) encodes an alternative ammonia assimilation
pathway [20], but none of the sequenced Blochmannia
retain this gene. We searched the NCBI Genomes database to determine whether any other completely
sequenced bacterium possesses urease but lacks glutamine synthetase and glutamate dehydrogenase. Of the
371 bacterial genomes encoding urease, 359 also have
an ortholog of the B. pennsylvanicus Class I glutamine
synthetase. Among the remaining 12 genomes, four
have an ortholog of glnA from Bacteroides fragilis,
which is the prototypical example of a Class III glutamine synthetase, and five genomes have an ortholog of
E. coli glutamate dehydrogenase (gdhA). In all, 368 of
the 371 bacterial genomes with urease also encode an
ammonia assimilation pathway catalyzed by either glutamine synthetase (Class I or Class III) or glutamate dehydrogenase. The three genomes lacking glnA or gdhA are
all strains of Ureaplasma, which uses high intracellular
concentrations of ammonia to generate an electrochemical gradient for driving ATP synthesis [21].
The urease gene cluster in Blochmannia

To determine whether loss of glutamine synthetase is
correlated with relaxed selection on the urease genes in
B. vafer, we compared evolutionary rates along the
lineages leading to B. vafer and B. floridanus since their
divergence from a common ancestor. For the 570 orthologs analyzed, the fold-increase in evolutionary rate
along the lineage leading to B. vafer had a wide range
(0.1 - 4.6), but a median value of 1.04, indicating no systematic rate difference between the B. vafer and B. floridanus lineages (Additional File 2). At urease genes,
the rate increase in B. vafer varied from 0.53 - 1.87 for
the three structural genes (ureABC) and 0.96 - 1.19 for
the accessory genes (ureDFG), indicating that the
absence of glnA in B. vafer is not correlated with consistent rate acceleration in the urease proteins.
We found no evidence to suggest that the urease
operon in Blochmannia was acquired by horizontal gene
transfer from outside of the gamma-proteobacteria.
Blochmannia urease proteins were most similar by
BLASTP analysis to those of other gamma-proteobacteria, including Pseudomonas (e.g., NC_010501) and
Klebsiella (e.g., NC_009648). Gene order in the urease
gene cluster was conserved among the related free-living
bacteria and Blochmannia; however, the Pseudomonas
urease operon consists of eight genes (ureDABCEJFG),

Williams and Wernegreen BMC Genomics 2010, 11:687
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/687

whereas the Blochmannia urease operon lacks urease
accessory genes ureE and ureJ. For all three sequenced
Blochmannia, the intergenic sequence (IGS) between
ureC and ureF is 298 - 470 bp, much larger than the
other IGSs in this operon, which ranged from 2 - 122
bp. As described below, the longer IGSs suggest that
ureE and ureJ might have been present in the ancestor
of Blochmannia.
Processes of genome reduction in B. vafer
(i) Deletion hotspot near the origin of replication

Genes missing or eroded in B. vafer were generally scattered throughout the genome, with the exception of
eight missing genes near the putative origin of replication (Figure 2). Because of the absence of a characteristic cluster of dnaA boxes, we identified the origin of
replication based on the shift in GC skew occurring
between yibN and hldD (Figure 3). Similar to B. floridanus, the putative origin of B. vafer is located approximately 32 kb upstream of gidA, which is the origin of
replication of B. pennsylvanicus [6,7]. This 32 kb region
contains three genes that are missing from both B. vafer
and B. floridanus and were likely lost prior to their
divergence, another gene missing from B. floridanus
only, and four genes missing from B. vafer only, including glnA.
(ii) Frameshifts within homopolymeric tracts

Similar to other obligate insect endosymbionts, the genome of B. vafer is extremely AT-biased (Table 1). All
three Blochmannia genomes contain numerous long (9
or more bp) polyA tracts within protein-coding regions
(153 such tracts in B. vafer, compared to 134 in B. floridanus and 114 in B. pennsylvanicus). Indels in homopolymeric tracts and resulting frameshifts are considered
key events in gene inactivation and loss in endosymbiont genomes [14]. However, some frameshifts may be
corrected by polymerase slippage during transcription,
allowing expression of full-length proteins [7,15,16].
Eight B. vafer genes have short indels within polyA or
polyT tracts resulting in frameshifts, compared to four
such genes in B. floridanus and four in B. pennsylvanicus (Figure 4). For the four genes that were frameshifted
exclusively in B. vafer (dnaG, dxs, pth and ribF), we
found no evidence of unusually accelerated evolutionary
rates along the lineage leading to B. vafer. Specifically,
when compared to the lineage leading to B. floridanus,
the fold-increase in evolutionary rates at the four genes
in B. vafer ranged from 1-1.5, well within the distribution for the 570 orthologs tested. Although it is conceivable that these frameshifts are recent, it is also possible
that the reading frame is corrected via transcriptional
slippage, as demonstrated for other Blochmannia and
Buchnera genes [7,15,16].

Page 4 of 14

Of the eight B. vafer genes with frameshifts, three are
involved in information transfer: dnaX, dnaG and pth.
DnaX encodes two subunits of the DNA polymerase III
holoenzyme, which is the primary replicative enzyme in
bacteria. In E. coli, expression of full-length dnaX generates the tau subunit, whereas ribosomal slippage generates the shorter gamma subunit [22-24]. Both of these
subunits are thought to participate in assembly of the
beta sliding clamp, which affects processivity of the pol
III holoenzyme [25]. The dnaX frameshift reported here
occurs downstream of the ribosomal slippage site,
within the region exclusive to the tau subunit. Comparisons of B. vafer and B. floridanus allowed us to identify
the same frameshift in B. floridanus dnaX, which was
previously reported as truncated [6]. Because this frameshift may be corrected by transcriptional slippage, we
propose that expression of full-length dnaX tau subunit
occurs at some level in both B. vafer and B. floridanus.
This frameshift is not found in B. pennsylvanicus dnaX,
possibly because the polyA tract is interrupted by two
thymines, which reduces the chances of slippage during
replication or transcription (Figure 4). The two other
frameshifted information transfer genes in B. vafer
encode DNA primase (dnaG) and peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase (pth) (Figure 4). DnaG synthesizes short RNA primers essential for lagging strand DNA replication,
whereas Pth plays an important role in maintaining efficient protein synthesis by cleaving peptidyl-tRNAs
released from stalled ribosomes [26].
To provide a phylogenetic perspective on these indels
within homopolymeric tracts, we confirmed that B. vafer
and B. floridanus are more closely related to each other
than either is to B. pennsylvanicus (Additional File 3).
Based on this topology, two genes, erfK and ytfM, show
evidence for independent frameshift events and/or a
reversion to an intact reading frame (Figure 5). Independent frameshift events in ytfM are supported by the different location of the indel in B. pennsylvanicus,
compared to B. floridanus and B. vafer (Figure 4).
(iii) Convergent patterns of gene loss or erosion among
Blochmannia

In addition to examining the history of frameshifted
genes, we also identified several examples of convergent
gene loss and erosion among the three Blochmannia
genomes (Figure 5). Three genes (queA, visC and yggS)
were likely lost or eroded in independent events. QueA
was likely lost in the lineage leading to B. pennsylvanicus and degraded in the lineage leading to B. vafer
sometime after B. vafer and B. floridanus diverged. VisC
is intact in B. pennsylvanicus but absent from B. floridanus. In B. vafer, visC has a single indel within a tract of
11 adenines. This frameshift might be corrected by transcriptional slippage, but it could, in principle, also

represent very recent gene erosion that is independent
from visC loss in B. floridanus.
In the case of yggS, no detectable relicts of the gene
remain in either B. floridanus or B. pennsylvanicus, but
the gene is intact in B. vafer. We found no evidence to
support the hypothesis that yggS was acquired by B. vafer
via horizontal gene transfer. The top BLASTP hits for
B. vafer YggS were other gamma-proteobacteria, including the insect endosymbiont Sodalis glossinidius, which is
considered a close relative of Blochmannia [27]. In addition, the corresponding intergenic spacer sequences in
B. floridanus (663 bp) and B. pennsylvanicus (942 bp)
were much larger than median IGS lengths (114 bp and
172 bp, respectively; see below), suggesting the presence
of a severely eroded gene remnant. Finally, the GC content and codon usage of yggS is typical for the B. vafer
genome (data not shown). Combined, this data strongly
argues against recent horizontal transfer and are most
consistent with yggS being present in the ancestral Blochmannia genome. This gene was most likely lost independently in the lineage leading to B. floridanus, sometime
after B. floridanus and B. vafer diverged, and in the lineage leading to B. pennsylvanicus.
YggS might be involved in osmotolerance [28]; however, its exact function is unclear [29]. Notably, this protein is encoded by a number of other bacterial
endosymbionts of insects (Figure 6), including Blattabacterium (cockroach), Buchnera aphidicola (aphid),

endosymbionts lacking yggS, a few have severely reduced
genomes, such as Carsonella (160 kb), Hodgkinia (144
kb) and Sulcia (244-277 kb).
Although the three Blochmannia genomes are severely
reduced, most genome reduction occurred before their
divergence. Ongoing gene disruption and loss since they
diverged has affected ‹10% of genes encoded in the
ancestral genome. Given this, the probability that

including four exceptionally long palindromes ›100 bp
in length. B. floridanus and B. pennsylvanicus palindromes ranged from 62 - 104 bp (median 76 bp) and 62 78 bp (median 72 bp), respectively. Given the high rates of
nucleotide and indel mutations in Blochmannia [31],
intergenic palindromes would likely decay in the absence
of selection favoring their presence.

Intergenic sequences in B. vafer and B. floridanus were
significantly shorter than those of B. pennsylvanicus
(Wilcoxon rank sum test; p ‹ 0.001) (Table 1). Because
gene order is strictly conserved in all three sequenced
Blochmannia genomes, we were able to identify IGSs
spanning missing genes in each genome. For both
B. vafer and B. floridanus, such IGSs were significantly
longer than IGSs between conserved genes (Wilcoxon
rank sum test; p ‹0.0001). We detected no significant
difference in the lengths of IGSs spanning missing genes
between B. vafer and B. floridanus (Wilcoxon rank sum
test; p ›0.05), suggesting that deletion rates in these
IGSs are similar in both genomes.
The importance of intergenic sequences in reduced
endosymbiont genomes is largely unexplored. Coding
sequences, including protein-coding and RNA-coding
genes, occupy from 77.8 - 85.0% of the three Blochmannia genomes (Table 1), a lower fraction than many freeliving bacteria [12]. Non-coding elements within IGSs
may play important roles in fundamental cellular processes. We searched the Blochmannia genomes for long
palindromic sequences, which may impact control of
transcription or mRNA stabilization [30]. We identified
20 large (›30 bp) palindromes in B. floridanus, 10 in

Discussion
Like B. floridanus and B. pennsylvanicus, B. vafer retains
several key nutritional functions that may benefit the
ant host, including biosynthesis of all essential amino
acids except arginine. However, the nitrogen recycling
pathway proposed for B. floridanus and B. pennsylvanicus is not complete in B. vafer (Figure 7). Although
B. vafer encodes the urease gene cluster, which hydrolyzes urea to ammonia and carbon dioxide, it lacks glutamine synthetase or any other means of assimilating
nitrogen from ammonia into glutamine, an important
precursor to biosynthesis of other amino acids.
In B. vafer, ammonia might be exported into the host
cell cytosol, where Class II glutamine synthetase
encoded by the ant host [32] may catalyze the assimilation of nitrogen and prevent the toxic accumulation of
ammonia (Figure 7). Alternatively, excess ammonia may
be used as a nitrogen donor by carbamoyl phosphate
synthase (carAB). This enzyme, along with argI, catalyzes the initial steps of arginine biosynthesis in all three
sequenced Blochmannia (Figure 7). The resulting product, citrulline, is exported to the host cell cytosol to
complete arginine biosynthesis [6]. Although glutamine

continued gene erosion and loss would occur by chance
in two different Blochmannia lineages at the same gene
is rather low. Instead, independent loss or erosion, such
as we observed at queA and yggS, suggests relaxed selective pressure on gene function. Conversely, the retention
of queA and yggS in B. floridanus and B. vafer, respectively, suggests that their functions may remain important for host-specific aspects of the symbiosis.

is the preferred nitrogen donor for carAB, ammonia can
be used as a substrate in the absence of glutamine [33].
Whether carbamoyl phosphate synthase plays a role in
eliminating ammonia in B. vafer depends upon the concentration of glutamine in the endosymbiont cells (i.e.,
the amount of glutamine imported from the ant host). If

glutamine is limiting, then carAB may use the excess
ammonia produced by urease as a substrate.
With the exception of Ureaplasma, B. vafer is the only
completely sequenced bacterium in the current NCBI
Genomes database that possesses urease but lacks the
ability to assimilate ammonia into glutamine or

glutamate. All other bacteria with urease also encode
ammonia assimilation pathways catalyzed by either glutamine synthetase (Class I or, more rarely, Class III) or
glutamate dehydrogenase. This includes the cockroach
endosymbiont Blattabacterium, which encodes urease
and glutamate dehydrogenase [34,35]. The only exceptions are strains of the bacterial genus Ureaplasma, a
commensal and opportunistic pathogen that colonizes
the human urogenital tract and belongs to the Class
Mollicutes [36]. In Ureaplasma, high intracellular concentrations of ammonia are thought to generate an electrochemical gradient that drives ATP synthesis [21].
There is no evidence that this process occurs in Blochmannia. With the loss of glutamine synthetase, B. vafer
may have relinquished a component of the ancestral
mutualism to the ant host. It is unclear whether or how
the loss of glnA affects the fitness of B. vafer and/or its
ant host.
Gene loss and erosion is accelerated in the lineages
leading to B. vafer and B. floridanus compared to B.
pennsylvanicus. The mechanism(s) underlying the more
extensive genome reduction in B. vafer and B. floridanus
may occur at both the level of the endosymbiont and
the level of the ant host. For example, the smaller size
of intergenic spacers in B. vafer and B. floridanus suggest a faster rate of deletion mutations compared to the
lineage leading to B. pennsylvanicus. Elevated mutation
may reflect differences in the natural history of the host
species sampled. Whereas C. pennsylvanicus and relatives in the subgenus Camponotus typically live in temperate regions and hibernate for part of the year,
C. vafer and C. floridanus and their relatives live in warmer climates and their colonies are more active
throughout the year. These differences in host activity
and life history could affect the number of symbiont
replications per year and thus influence the mutation
rate per unit time.

Many genes missing in one or more Blochmannia
genomes are also missing from other insect endosymbionts (Figure 6), suggesting that the functions encoded
are not essential across all intracellular mutualists. Five
genes showed evidence of independent instances of gene
loss, erosion and/or frameshifts within Blochmannia.
Particularly in the case of gene absence or erosion, these
convergent patterns suggest relaxed selective pressure
on gene function, rather than chance loss. These independent events may reflect the historical contingency of
gene loss and erosion in the ancestral genome, which
affects selective pressure on remaining genes.
We found frameshift errors in three genes involved in
DNA replication or protein synthesis: dnaG, dnaX and
pth. These genes are considered essential for fundamental cellular processes in E. coli. Although expression of
full-length proteins may be restored by transcriptional
slippage, previous work showed that full-length transcripts accounted for ‹30% of the transcripts produced
from frameshifted genes [15]. Therefore, it is possible
that frameshifts lower the effective expression of these
genes in B. vafer. The impact on DNA replication fidelity and efficiency of protein synthesis is unclear.
The deletion hotspot detected around the putative origin of replication in both B. vafer and B. floridanus
occurs in the 32 kb region between the B. vafer origin
and the location of the origin in B. pennsylvanicus.
Given that the putative origin of replication in B. pennsylvanicus occurs at the same genomic location as the
origins in E. coli and in other insect endosymbionts of
the gamma-proteobacteria, it seems likely that the origin
of replication shifted in the ancestral lineage of B. vafer
and B. floridanus. Although the mechanisms underlying
this shift are unclear, it is interesting that relocation of
the origin is correlated with a concentration of gene
deletions in this region.

Conclusions
Comparisons of the B. vafer genome with the previously
published B. floridanus and B. pennsylvanicus genomes
clarified the core set of genes and functions shared by
this mutualist group. More broadly, these data inform
studies of processes of genome reduction in intracellular
bacteria. (i) The surprising loss of glutamine synthetase
(glnA) from B. vafer, despite retention of urease genes,
suggests a profound difference in nitrogen recycling
within this species. In B. floridanus and B. pennsylvanicus, the ammonia generated by urease is assimilated
during glutamine biosynthesis. In the C. vafer-Blochmannia association, ammonia assimilation may occur by
an alternative pathway, such as glutamine biosynthesis
in the host or the initial steps of arginine biosynthesis
catalyzed by the endosymbiont. Database searches

Williams and Wernegreen BMC Genomics 2010, 11:687
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/687

showed that lack of ammonia assimilation by glutamine
synthetase or glutamate dehydrogenase in a ureaseencoding bacterium is extremely rare. (ii) Evaluating
Blochmannia genome reduction in a phylogenetic context revealed instances of convergent gene loss or erosion at queA, visC, and yggS, which may be associated
with changes in selective pressure on these genes. (iii) A
deletion hotspot in both B. vafer and B. floridanus
occurs within a 32 kb region corresponding to the likely
relocation of the replication origin. (iv) Eight B. vafer
genes contain frameshifts in homopolymeric tracts,
including two genes encoding DNA replication proteins
and one gene important for efficient protein synthesis.
Although such frameshifts may be corrected by transcriptional slippage, expression of full-length proteins is
likely reduced compared to wild-type levels and has possible implications for efficiency and accuracy of information transfer.

Methods
Blochmannia vafer genomic DNA preparation

B. vafer genomic DNA (gDNA) was prepared from C.
vafer workers and larvae collected from a single colony
(Cvafe543) in the Coronado National Forest near Portal,
Arizona. Vouchers from this colony will be deposited at
the Bohart Museum of Entomology, University of California, Davis. We isolated Blochmannia cells from 7.8 g
of ants using a Percoll density gradient centrifugation
protocol described previously [37], with a 100 μm filtration step instead of the 90 μm filtration. Isolated Blochmannia cells were treated with DNase to remove
extracellular host DNA, lysozyme and proteinase K to
break down bacterial cell walls and membranes, and
RNase to remove rRNA and other RNA species. After
these treatments, we extracted gDNA with phenol
chloroform followed by ethanol precipitation.
Genome sequencing and assembly

A paired-end sequencing library was constructed at Illumina (Hayward, CA) following standard procedures.
Adaptors were used to multiplex this sample with two
other samples on a single Illumina lane. Sequencing on
an Illumina Genome Analyzer II (GAII) with Illumina
pipeline 1.4 produced 14,907,136 100-bp paired end
reads.
We performed all data analysis in house. Prior to de
novo assembly, we filtered the read dataset to remove
read pairs in which either read had an ambiguous base
call (denoted by N) or an average quality score ‹Q25.
The filter retained 10,157,316 reads (68% of total read
dataset). From these filtered reads, we randomly selected
3 million read pairs. We then assembled the reads with
Velvet version 0.7.55 [38] using the following parameters: hash length 49, expected coverage 200, coverage

Page 10 of 14

cutoff 25 and no scaffolding. This assembly strategy generated three contigs of Blochmannia genome sequence
comprising 42,053 bp, 118,857 bp and 561,103 bp.
To close the three gaps, we first determined gap sizes
by PCR amplification of the original gDNA using primers annealing to flanking regions in the assembled
contigs. We closed the gap corresponding to the membrane-spanning repeat region of tolA with Sanger
sequencing, using Phred/Phrap/Consed [39-41] to
assemble and manually examine the sequence. Although
the remaining two gaps were short, secondary structure
arising from long palindromes impaired Sanger sequencing. Upon inspection, we found that palindromes had
also impeded Velvet assembly, but the gaps could be
manually closed with existing Illumina sequence data
(Additional File 4).
To generate the finished genome, we used Mosaik [42]
to align the full Illumina read dataset against the closed
sequence. This step clarified the majority genotype (i.e.,
for each nucleotide position, the base called in the
majority of reads), since de novo assembly used a subset
of reads rather than the full read dataset. The Mosaik
DupSnoop module identified 42% of the aligned read
pairs as duplicates. Because most of these duplicates
were likely generated during PCR amplification of the
Illumina library, we removed duplicates from the final
Mosaik alignment. We used Consed to view the alignment and recall the consensus sequence. Coverage of
the finished genome (without duplicate read pairs) averaged 542×, calculated using the MosaikCoverage module. The finished genome is deposited in GenBank with
the accession number CP002189.
Gene prediction and annotation

The finished genome was submitted to the MANATEE
annotation engine hosted by the Institute for Genome
Sciences (IGS) at the University of Maryland School of
Medicine for an initial automated annotation. MANATEE uses Glimmer for gene prediction, tRNAscan to
identify tRNAs, and RNAmmer or Rfam to identify
structural RNAs.
We manually curated the MANATEE annotation. An
ORF was retained if it had at least one of the following
pieces of evidence: a Blast-Extend-Repraze (BER) alignment scoring ‹10-5 to a protein from another organism,
a HMM hit or a Prosite hit. We used the gene name
suggested by SwissProt for the homologous gene in E.
coli to provide consistency with other proteobacterial
genome annotations. For genes with no suggested name
in SwissProt, such as hypothetical genes, the gene name
given for the homologous gene in B. floridanus or B.
pennsylvanicus was used.
We curated start sites on the basis of BER alignments
to other, non-Blochmannia genomes. BER searches also

Williams and Wernegreen BMC Genomics 2010, 11:687
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/687

identified genes that contain a frameshift within a polyA
or polyT tract but otherwise resemble intact genes.
Because these frameshifts may be corrected by transcriptional slippage, we consider these genes potentially functional and annotated them as intact ORFs. The GenBank
annotation indicates the position of such frameshifts.
We used two approaches to identify uncalled genes
and pseudogenes in B. vafer. First, we searched intergenic regions at least 30 bp in length using BLASTX
and the NCBI Protein Reference Sequences database
with default parameters except that the low complexity
sequence filter was turned off. We considered hits covering at least 60% of the subject protein sequence and
yielding an e-score of ‹10-5 as evidence of an uncalled
gene or a pseudogene. For two intergenic regions, the
top BLASTX hits were B. pennsylvanicus and/or B. floridanus, but the alignments had multiple nonsense mutations and gaps. Based on the alignments and their
location within the conserved gene order of Blochmannia, we identified these regions as pseudogenes of bcp
and queA.
We also took advantage of synteny in Blochmannia to
screen for additional pseudogenes in B. vafer. For any
genes present in B. floridanus and/or B. pennsylvanicus
but missing in B. vafer, we compared the corresponding
B. vafer intergenic region to the gene in the other Blochmannia genome(s) using TBLASTX. Apart from bcp
and queA as noted above, we found no sequence similarity pointing to other recognizable pseudogenes in
B. vafer.
We used the tRNAscan-SE program to identify tRNAs
in the genome [43]. This program flags a tRNA as a
potential pseudogene if it has a primary structure
(HMM) score ‹10 bits or a secondary structure score ‹5
bits. (The primary structure score reflects nucleotide
sequence similarity to sequence profiles of tRNAs,
whereas the secondary structure score reflects RNA
folding into the characteristic cloverleaf structure.)
Three tRNAs in B. vafer were flagged due to low primary structure scores. However, their secondary structure scores were 28, 33 and 43, well above the 5 bit
cutoff, and the predicted secondary structures had the
characteristic cloverleaf form. Because endosymbiont
genomes have extremely low GC content, the primary
structure score cutoff normally used for bacteria with
more moderate GC content, such as E. coli, may not be
appropriate for Blochmannia. Our examination of the
three tRNAs flagged as possible pseudogenes suggest
that these are functional tRNAs, and we have annotated
them as such. Re-analysis of the B. pennsylvanicus genome, which has one reported pseudo-tRNA, revealed
the same phenomenon of low primary structure score
but high secondary structure score, therefore we consider this tRNA functional in this study.

Screening for glnA in additional B. vafer

We confirmed the absence of glutamine synthetase
(glnA) in B. vafer from C. vafer workers collected from
eight additional colonies in the Coronado National Forest. From a total DNA prep of an individual worker, we
amplified a region of the B. vafer genome using primers
anchored in gmk and polA, which flank rpoZ and glnA
in B. floridanus and B. pennsylvanicus. The resulting
amplicons include the complete coding sequence of
rpoZ and the intergenic sequence corresponding to the
former location of glnA. We sequenced the amplified
region using Sanger sequencing and assembled the reads
with Phred/Phrap/Consed [39-41]. We also sequenced
trpE from all of these B. vafer except strain 21. Accession numbers are: HQ593629-HQ593636 (rpoZ region)
and HQ603678-HQ603684 (trpE).
Identification of B. vafer replication origin

We used the Pattern Locator program [44] to search the
B. vafer genome for dnaA boxes using the consensus
sequence TTWTNCACA [45]. In the absence of a characteristic cluster of dnaA boxes, we used the CGview
Server [46] to analyze the GC skew of the genome. The
CGView Server calculates GC skew as (G-C)/(G+C)
using sliding windows of 1000 bp and a step size of 10
bp. The CGView Server also calculated GC content
using the same sliding window parameters.
Palindrome analysis

We used the EMBOSS palindrome script to search the
genomes of B. vafer, B. floridanus, and B. pennsylvanicus
for palindromes between 30-1000 bp, with a maximum
gap of 20 bp between inverted repeats and a maximum
of 3 mismatches.
Comparisons among Blochmannia genomes
(i) Gene content comparisons

We compared the gene content of the three Blochmannia genomes using a bidirectional best hit BLASTP analysis available through RAST (Rapid Annotation using
Subsystem Technology) [47]. Pairwise comparisons of
the genomes identified shared genes as bidirectional
best hits. For genes yielding unidirectional best hits or
fragmented hits, such as genes with frameshifts in
homopolymeric tracts, we examined the annotations and
performed additional BLASTP analyses to determine the
presence or absence of the gene.
(ii) Detection of additional B. floridanus and B.
pennsylvanicus genes

Based on comparisons of all three sequenced Blochmannia, we identified four protein-coding genes in B. floridanus and a RNA-coding gene in both B. floridanus and
B. pennsylvanicus that were not previously annotated.
We included these genes in our analyses here. To

Williams and Wernegreen BMC Genomics 2010, 11:687
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/687

determine the start and stop coordinates of the proteincoding genes, we used TBLASTN to align the B. vafer
or B. pennsylvanicus amino acid sequence to the B. floridanus nucleotide sequence. If the alignment did not
include start and stop codons, we extended the coordinates to include the closest upstream ATG start codon
and the downstream stop codon. To determine the
coordinates of the RNA-coding gene, we used the Rfam
sequence search.
(iii) Analysis of frameshifted genes

Genes containing single frameshifts within polyA or
polyT tracts were compared to orthologs in the other
Blochmannia genomes. Nucleotide sequences were
translated, aligned with ClustalX and back-translated to
obtain nucleotide sequence alignments. For the purposes
of comparing evolutionary rates at these loci, the frameshifts within polyA tracts were corrected, and the genes
were treated as intact.
(iv) Evolutionary rate comparison

We compared rates of protein evolution in the lineages
leading to B. vafer and B. floridanus, using B. pennsylvanicus as an outgroup. First, we used the Reciprocal Smallest
Distance (RSD) algorithm [48] to identify orthologs shared
among the three genomes. By using stringent detection
parameters in RSD, we included only those orthologs with
robust alignments for dN calculations. (Reflecting the stringent criteria, RSD detected slightly fewer shared orthologs
(570) than the 575 protein-coding genes detected in our
direct comparisons of gene contents.) For each shared
ortholog, we estimated the three pairwise dN values using a
likelihood-based approach in PAML [49]. We then calculated the fold-increase in evolutionary rate for each gene
along the lineage leading to B. vafer as K1/K2, in which K1
is the amount of nonsynonymous change along the branch
leading to B. vafer from the most recent common ancestor
with B. floridanus, and K2 is the amount of nonsynonymous
change along the branch leading to B. floridanus.
(v) IGS analysis

We defined intergenic spacer sequences (IGS) as the
sequences between protein-coding genes, RNA-coding
genes or pseudogenes. Our calculation of IGS lengths does
not include instances of overlapping gene coordinates that
result in no intergenic sequence between the two genes.
We used a perl script written by Sheri Simmons to extract
intergenic sequences from the B. vafer genome.

cover at least 60% of the E. coli protein sequence and
have an e-score ‹10-5 (with the exception of ftsY, which
required at least 50% coverage and an e-score ‹10-5). We
examined the annotations of the endosymbiont genomes
to ensure that the hits corresponded to homologous
genes, rather than a similar gene from the same family
(such as ispA and ispB). If the region corresponding to
the alignment was not annotated in the endosymbiont
genome, we did a BLASTP analysis of the encoded
amino acid sequence against the SwissProt database and
used the top hit to identify the gene.
Analysis of urease and ammonia assimilation enzyme
distribution in bacterial genomes

We used the B. pennsylvanicus ureC amino acid
sequence in a TBLASTN search of the NCBI Genomes
database with TaxID 2 to limit the search to bacterial
genomes. This search returned 371 hits with at least 50%
coverage and an e-score ‹10-30. We then did a TBLASTN
search of these 371 bacterial genomes using the B. pennsylvanicus glnA amino acid sequence. The gene was considered present if the alignment had at least 50%
coverage and an e-score ‹10-30. For three genomes, we
discovered that ureC and glnA were encoded on different
chromosomes, and for one genome, ureC was encoded
on a plasmid whereas glnA was encoded on the chromosome. Genomes that did not encode an ortholog of B.
pennsylvanicus glnA were searched for Class III glutamine synthetase from Bacteroides fragilis YCH46
(NC_006347) and glutamate dehydrogenase from E. coli
K12 MG1655 (NC_000913) using TBLASTN.
Statistical analysis

All statistical analyses used JMP version 8.

Comparison of gene content across insect endosymbionts

Among select other bacterial endosymbionts, we
checked for the presence of protein-coding genes that
were missing or eroded in the Blochmannia genomes.
For each gene, the protein sequence from E. coli K12
MG1655 (NC_000913) was used as the query in a
TBLASTN search against the endosymbiont genomes.
For a gene to qualify as present, the alignment must
