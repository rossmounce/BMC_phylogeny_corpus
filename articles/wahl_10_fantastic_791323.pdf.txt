The FANTASTIC FOUR proteins influence shoot
meristem size in Arabidopsis thaliana
Vanessa Wahl1,3, Luise H Brand2,3, Ya-Long Guo3, Markus Schmid3*

Abstract
Background: Throughout their lives plants produce new organs from groups of pluripotent cells called meristems,
located at the tips of the shoot and the root. The size of the shoot meristem is tightly controlled by a feedback
loop, which involves the homeodomain transcription factor WUSCHEL (WUS) and the CLAVATA (CLV) proteins. This
regulatory circuit is further fine-tuned by morphogenic signals such as hormones and sugars.
Results: Here we show that a family of four plant-specific proteins, encoded by the FANTASTIC FOUR (FAF) genes,
has the potential to regulate shoot meristem size in Arabidopsis thaliana. FAF2 and FAF4 are expressed in the
centre of the shoot meristem, overlapping with the site of WUS expression. Consistent with a regulatory interaction
between the FAF gene family and WUS, our experiments indicate that the FAFs can repress WUS, which ultimately
leads to an arrest of meristem activity in FAF overexpressing lines. The finding that meristematic expression of FAF2
and FAF4 is under negative control by CLV3 further supports the hypothesis that the FAFs are modulators of the
genetic circuit that regulates the meristem.
Conclusion: This study reports the initial characterization of the Arabidopsis thaliana FAF gene family. Our data
indicate that the FAF genes form a plant specific gene family, the members of which have the potential to
regulate the size of the shoot meristem by modulating the CLV3-WUS feedback loop.

Background
In contrast to animals, plant development is highly plastic, with new organs being formed continuously from
pools of stem cells maintained in structures called meristems. This plasticity allows plants, within certain limits,
to adapt their body shape in response to developmental,
physical and environmental cues. The ability to form new
organs throughout their life cycle requires tight control
of the meristems to avoid unregulated growth. Plants
have evolved an elaborate genetic network that controls
meristem size and maintenance [1,2]. At the core of the
network that regulates the size of the stem cell population in the shoot meristem are the homeodomain transcription factor WUSCHEL (WUS) and the CLAVATA
(CLV) ligand-receptor system [1,3-5]. WUS is expressed
in the organizing centre (OC) of the meristem and positively regulates CLV3 expression in the stem cells, which
are localized above the OC [6]. CLV3 encodes a small

secreted peptide, which cell non-autonomously represses
WUS in the OC [6-10]. It has recently been shown, that
CLV3 directly binds to the ectodomain of the LRR receptor kinase CLV1 [11]. Similarly, it has been suggested
that the receptor-like protein CLV2 interacts with the
novel receptor kinase CORYNE (CRN; SUPPRESSOR OF
OVEREXPRESSION OF LLP1-2, SOL2) to establish a
functional CLV3 receptor [12,13]. Thus a feedback loop
is established, which is essential to set up and maintain
the stem cell population at the shoot meristem. However,
the relationship between WUS and CLV3 is not static;
the WUS-CLV system can compensate for changes in
CLV3 expression over a wide range [14].
WUS expression is also controlled by phytohormones,
which have been implicated in maintaining the stem cell
system as well as setting up developmental compartments at the shoot meristem and in establishing the
developmental fate of cells that are derived from the
stem cell pool [reviewed in 2]. Besides hormones, sugars
also appear to play an important role in establishing and
maintaining meristem identity [reviewed in 15]. For
example, it has been shown that growth arrest caused

by loss of the WUS-related homeodomain factor
STIMPY/WOX9 was rescued to a large extent by providing sucrose in the growth medium. This demonstrates
that sucrose can compensate for the loss of at least
some genes normally required for meristem development [16].
Here we present an initial characterization of a plantspecific gene family - FANTASTIC FOUR (FAF) - with
four members in Arabidopsis thaliana (FAF1 - FAF4).
We show that the FAF genes are expressed throughout
the life cycle of the plant, but exhibit strong temporal
and spatial regulation. FAF2 and FAF4 expression was
detected in the centre of the shoot meristem by RNA in
situ hybridization and GUS reporter constructs. In addition, expression of the FAF genes was detectable in the
developing and mature vasculature. FAF gene overexpression negatively affected growth of both the shoot
and the root. At the molecular level, the arrest of shoot
growth was accompanied by a marked decrease in WUS
expression. We further show that meristematic expression of FAF2 and FAF4 is under negative control by
CLV3. Together these data suggest that the FAF proteins are capable of modulating shoot growth by repressing WUS in the OC of the shoot meristem.

Results
The FANTASTIC FOUR (FAF) genes define a plant specific
gene family

The Arabidopsis thaliana FAF genes first caught our
attention because two of them, FAF1 (At4g02810) and
FAF2 (At1g03170), responded strongly and rapidly to a
shift in photoperiod in a microarray experiment (Additional File 1 Figure S1) [17]. FAF1 and FAF2 belong to
an uncharacterized gene family that also includes FAF3
and FAF4 (At5g19260, At3g06020, Table 1). Both pairs
of genes, Arabidopsis thaliana FAF1/FAF2 and FAF3/
FAF4, appear to be recently duplicated paralogs [18].
The proteins encoded by the FAF genes do not contain
any domains of known function (Table 1). In addition,
the Arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes a more
distantly related protein (At5g22090), which we call
FAF-like (Additional File 1 Table S1). FAF and FAF-like
proteins share several conserved domains, among them
a stretch of acidic residues in their C-terminal half.

Since the FAF genes have not been previously
described, we wished to determine how widespread they
are among other species. To address this question we
searched publicly available sequence databases by reciprocal BLAST analysis for potential orthologs of the
FAF genes. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the FAF
genes originated from a FAF-like gene and that today’s
FAF genes arose through several rounds of duplications
within the dicotyledonous plants (Additional File 1
Figure S2). FAF genes were not apparent in the rice
genome or any other monocotyledonous species, even
though proteins sharing homology with the Arabidopsis
thaliana FAF-like gene were clearly present (Additional
File 1 Table S1). Sequence homology searches failed to
identify any potentially homologous proteins outside the
plant kingdom, indicating that the FAF gene family is
plant-, possibly eudicotyledonous-specific.
Expression of FAF genes throughout development

In order to determine the temporal and spatial regulation
of the expression of the four FAF genes throughout
development, we consulted the AtGenExpress Arabidopsis thaliana expression atlas [19]. All four FAF transcripts
were detectable throughout development (Figure 1).
Expression of FAF1 and FAF2 at the shoot apex increased
during the transition to flowering, while FAF3 and FAF4
decreased, confirming the results observed in the first
microarray dataset (Additional File 1 Figure S1). However, FAF1 and FAF2 exhibited strong differences in their
expression profiles in other tissues. For example, while
FAF1 and FAF2 were both highly expressed in the apical
region during the floral transition, only FAF2 expression
was maintained at high levels during later stages of flower
development, especially in carpels. In contrast, FAF1
expression appeared to be more transient, with some
expression maintained in stamens. Similarly to FAF2,
FAF3 was expressed in stamens, but was also strongly
expressed in the youngest leaves formed by the plant
(Figure 1). This expression, however, disappeared as the
leaves aged. Expression of all four FAF genes was detectable in young siliques, but expression faded as seed
maturation progressed. Taken together, our analysis of
microarray data showed that the FAF genes are dynamically expressed throughout development.

expression atlas of Arabidopsis thaliana development. Samples confirming the expression changes observed at the apex during the floral
transition (Additional File 1 Figure S1) are shaded.

FAF genes are expressed in the centre of the shoot
meristem and in vascular tissue

To analyze FAF expression at cellular resolution, we carried out RNA in situ hybridization (Figure 2). Expression
of all four FAF genes was detected in provascular and
vascular tissue at different stages throughout development. FAF1 and FAF2 were only weakly expressed in the
vasculature of vegetative plants (Figure 2B, C, G, H). In
addition to the vasculature, FAF2 mRNA was also detectable in the centre of the vegetative meristem (Figure 2C).
In contrast, FAF3 and FAF4 could easily be detected in
the vasculature (Figure 2D, E, I, J; arrows), but neither
seemed to be expressed in the vegetative meristem (Figure 2D, E).
Expression of the FAF genes changed upon the onset
of flowering (Figure 2L-O), as already observed in the
microarray experiments (Figure 1). FAF1 and FAF2 were
induced in the inflorescence vasculature and young
flower buds as flowering commenced (Figure 2L, M). In
contrast, FAF3 and FAF4 expression in inflorescences
was restricted to the vasculature, but was largely absent
from young flowers (Figure 2N, O). Both, FAF2 and
FAF4 were, however, detected in the centre of the
inflorescence meristem (Figure 2 M, O; arrowheads).
Upon fertilization, expression of FAF1, FAF3, FAF4,
but not FAF2 could also be detected in the developing
embryo, starting from the early heart stage and lasting
until torpedo stage (Figure 2Q-T). FAF2 expression was,
however, detectable in the funiculus (Figure 2V,
arrowhead).
The dynamic nature of FAF gene regulation was confirmed by the dramatic changes in reporter gene activity
observed during the first 8 days after germination

(Additional File 1 Figure S3). FAF1::GUS activity, for
example, was initially restricted to the hypocotyl, but
expression gradually shifted to the root over the following four days. Starting on day 6, FAF1::GUS became
active in the vasculature of the cotyledons and subsequently also in the leaves. Similar, but distinct, dynamic
regulation of reporter gene activity could also be
observed for the other FAF promoters (Additional File 1
Figure S3). In addition, FAF2::GUS was observed in the
centre of the vegetative shoot meristem (Additional File
1 Figure S4H) as already shown by RNA in situ hybridization (Figure 2M). After the onset of flowering, FAF1::
GUS was observed most strongly in anthers (Additional
File 1 Figure S4A), while FAF2::GUS expression was
strongest in the carpel, particularly in the funiculus
(Additional File 1 Figure S4B, G), where FAF2 RNA had
also been detected (Figure 2V). FAF3::GUS activity was
restricted to anthers (Additional File 1 Figure S4C),
whereas FAF4 was expressed at the base of the flower
and in the vasculature of the pedicels and the inflorescence stem (Additional File 1 Figure S4D). In differentiated tissues such as root and leaves, the FAF genes
were predominantly expressed in the phloem, as shown
for FAF2 (Additional File 1 Figure S3E, F).
In summary, FAF2 and FAF4 are expressed in the centre
of the shoot meristem, suggesting a potential role for these
two FAF proteins in meristem development. In addition,
all FAF genes are expressed in the vasculature, where they
may function in a partially redundant manner.
FAF proteins can affect growth and meristem size

To study the function of the FAF proteins during development, we first searched for knock-out lines (Additional

FAF genes at the vegetative apex. Longitudinal (A-E) and transverse sections (F-J) through the vegetative apex hybridized with sense (A, F) and
antisense probes (B-E, G-J) against the four FAF genes are shown. Highest expression was detected for FAF3 and FAF4 in the vascular and
provascular tissue (D, E, I, J, arrows). (K-O) In inflorescences, FAF1 expression (L) was detected in the developing vasculature and young flowers.
FAF2 expression (M) was highest in the inflorescence stem, but also detectable in the centre of the meristem (M, arrowhead). Expression of FAF3
was restricted to the developing vasculature (N), while FAF4 was also found in the centre of the meristem (O, arrowhead). No signal was found
when sense probes were used (K). (P-V) During embryogenesis, FAF1 (Q), FAF3 (S), and FAF4 (T) were expressed in the embryo from heart stage
onward, while expression of FAF2 was limited to the funiculus (V). Sense probes (P, U) did not result in any staining. Scale bars: 100 μm (A-O),
50 μm (P-T).

File 1 Table S2). Most of the lines investigated showed
either wild-type mRNA levels, indicating that expression
of the corresponding FAF gene was unaltered in these
lines or the presence of the T-DNA could not be
confirmed or the lines were not available from the stock
centre. Only for FAF3 a potential RNA-null line
(SM_3_40331) could be recovered. This line, however, did
not show an obvious phenotype, possibly due to redundancy with the other FAF genes. Attempts to knock-down
individual or certain combinations of FAF genes by constitutive and inducible RNAi (Additional File 1 Table S3)
resulted in pleiotropic phenotypes in all T1 lines investigated. Unfortunately, all lines that eventually did set seeds
were silenced in T2, making further analysis impracticable.
Besides regular RNAi, artificial microRNAs (Additional
File 1 Table S4) were prepared to knock-down FAF

mRNAs either individually or in combination, but these
did not result in a significant degradation of the targeted
transcripts and lines showed no discernable phenotypes
[20,21]. Finally, tilling of FAF genes (Additional File 1
Table S5) also failed to produce alleles with major changes
such as premature stop codons [22,23].
Given the difficulty of obtaining loss-of-function lines,
we resorted to misexpression experiments. We constitutively expressed FAF genes under the control of the
viral 35 S promoter in planta. In general we observed
similar phenotypes, regardless of which FAF gene was
overexpressed, indicating that all four FAF proteins can
perform the same function. Lines expressing FAF genes
at a very high level, as determined by qRT-PCR (data
not shown), arrested shoot growth shortly after germination (Figure 3A, B). Arrest this early in development

was observed in 2% (FAF2) to 12% (FAF3) of independent T1 lines (n > 140 per FAF gene).
The strongest lines were sterile, therefore we focused
our analysis on those plants with intermediate expression levels (21% to 36% of independent T1 lines), for
which stable lines could be established. In these lines we
observed a strong reduction in root growth (Figure 3DG) when compared to wild-type plants (Figure 3C). This
was accompanied by an increased formation of adventitious roots at the hypocotyl. The arrest of the root
growth could be overcome when 1% sucrose was supplied in the medium (Figure 3 H, I).
Moderate FAF overexpressing plants were smaller
than wild-type, and leaf vasculature appeared to be
reduced (not shown). Apart from this they developed
normally, until after the transition to flowering and bolting, at which point inflorescence meristems ceased producing new organs and shoot elongation stopped
(Figure 4A and inset). In the last flowers to be formed
before the meristem arrested, floral organs, in particular
the stamens and carpel, were retarded in development
(Figure 4A, inset). When we examined the meristems in
more detail (Figure 4B, C), we found that the width of
the inflorescence meristems in FAF overexpressing lines
was on average reduced by approximately 30% when
compared to wild-type (Figure 4D).
FAF proteins can repress WUSCHEL in the organizing
centre of the shoot meristem

Loss of WUS function results in a reduction of meristem
size, similar to what we observed in FAF overexpressing
lines. Moreover, two FAF genes are expressed in the
centre of the meristem, overlapping with the site of
WUS expression in the OC. This prompted us to analyze expression of WUS in the meristem of FAF overexpressing lines (Figure 5A-E). We found that WUS
expression was strongly reduced in both inflorescence
and flower meristems. Since WUS is required for maintenance of meristem function, the reduction in WUS
expression is consistent with the meristem arrest phenotype seen in strong (Figure 3A) and moderate (Figure 4)
FAF overexpressing plants.
Expression of WUS in the OC of the shoot meristem
is under negative control of CLV3-dependent signalling.
We found that CLV3 expression was essentially normal
in FAF overexpressing lines (Figure 5F-J), indicating that
the reduction in WUS expression was not caused by an
increase or expansion of CLV3 expression.
Repression of FAF2 and FAF4 in the shoot meristem by
CLAVATA3

The fact that WUS expression is reduced in FAF overexpressing lines suggested that FAF2 and FAF4, which are
normally expressed in the meristem, might be involved

Page 6 of 12

in the CLV3 mediated repression of WUS. We therefore
analyzed FAF2 and FAF4 expression in clv3-7 mutants
(Figure 6). We found that expression of FAF2 was
strongly enhanced in the centre of clv3-7 inflorescence
meristems (Figure 6A, C), while its expression in the
vasculature appeared to be not affected. Although meristems are enlarged in clv3-7 mutants, the simple increase
in cell number does not explain the strong staining
observed, suggesting that FAF2 is under repression by
CLV3. Similarly, we found FAF4 to be expressed more
strongly in the enlarged centre of clv3-7 meristems
(Figure 6B, D), though the increase was not as pronounced as for FAF2. In order to confirm the upregulation of FAF2 and FAF4 in the inflorescence meristem of
clv3-7 mutants, we analyzed microarray expression data
of Col-0 and clv3-7 inflorescence meristems from the
AtGenExpress transcriptome atlas. We found significant
(logitT p < 0.01) and strong induction of FAF2 (2.2-fold)
and FAF4 (2.5-fold) in clv3-7 inflorescence meristems
when compared to Col-0 control plants (Figure 6E).
Confirming the quality of the array data, WUS was also
found to be significantly and strongly (2.9-fold) induced
in the clv3-7 mutant. Neither FAF1 nor FAF3 changed
significantly and strongly (> 2-fold) in the clv3-7 microarray data set.
The observed upregulation of FAF2 and FAF4 in clv37 inflorescence meristems could either indicate that
these two FAF genes are under repression by CLV3 or
that they are positively regulated by WUS. To be able to
distinguish between these two possibilities we examined
the response of FAF genes to inducible ectopic WUS
expression in a microarray dataset from 12-day-old
seedlings [24]. We found that none of the FAF genes
were induced, suggesting that they are not positively
regulated by WUS but are more likely to be under
repression by CLV3 (Figure 6F).
Taken together, our results indicate that FAF proteins,
when expressed at high levels, can affect shoot meristem
size in Arabidopsis thaliana by modulating CLV3dependent WUS expression. In wild-type plants, only
FAF2 and FAF4 are likely to participate in the regulation
of WUS since only these two genes are normally
expressed in the centre of the shoot meristem. In addition, FAF2 and FAF4 expression in the meristem
appears to be under negative control by the CLV3.
However, the observation that constitutive expression of
any of the four FAFs can affect meristem size demonstrates that the ability to repress WUS is intrinsic to all
four FAF proteins.

Discussion
The shoot apical meristem is initiated early during
embryogenesis and harbours a small population of pluripotent stem cells from which all aerial parts of the

plant are derived [1,25]. Establishment and maintenance
of these stem cells depends on the activity of the WUS
and CLV genes, which are mutually regulating each
other’s expression in a spatial negative feedback loop
[3]. WUS expression in the OC of the shoot meristem
promotes stem cell fate in the cells above while the
stem cells themselves secrete a small peptide, CLV3,

which is perceived by CLV1 and, possibly, the CLV2/
CRN receptor complex [3,11,12,26]. Ultimately, CLV3dependent signalling limits the size of the WUS-expressing OC. The WUS-CLV system is rather dynamic and
can, over time, compensate for even 10-fold differences
in CLV3 expression, indicating that CLV3 expression
confers information about stem-cell position to the

underlying OC rather than information about stem cell
number [14].
Analysis of FAF overexpressing lines by RNA in situ
hybridization demonstrated that WUS was strongly
downregulated in these lines. The fact that the expression of WUS was affected regardless of which FAF gene
was constitutively expressed, suggests that the ability to
repress WUS is intrinsic to all four FAF proteins. In
wild-type, FAF effects on WUS are likely to be exerted
only by FAF2 and FAF4, which are the two FAF genes
expressed in the centre of the shoot and/or inflorescence meristem in a domain that appears to be overlapping with the site of WUS expression.
In the clv3-7 mutant the expression domains of WUS
and FAF2/FAF4 appear to be largely exclusive. WUS is
limited to the second meristem layer (L2) but is no
longer detectable in the centre of the meristem [7,27].
In contrast, expression of FAF2 and FAF4 were found to
be upregulated in the centre of the meristem but are
mostly excluded from the L2. This suggests that in wildtype expression of FAF2/FAF4 might attenuate WUS
expression in the centre of the meristem whereas high
levels of FAF2/FAF4 in clv3-7 prevent WUS from being
expressed in the centre of the meristem and limit its
expression to the L2. Based on our results, we propose
that FAF genes function in the shoot meristem, with
CLV3 negatively regulating FAF2 and FAF4 expression,
which in turn contribute to the repression of WUS. In
this context it is interesting to note that all four FAF
proteins harbour a short sequence motif (L-X-L-X-L)
that is reminiscent of the EAR repression motif [28].
This would be in agreement with the proposed role of
FAF proteins as repressors of WUS.

Expression of FAF2 and FAF4 in the centre of the
meristem would put them in place to compensate for
the effects of positive regulators such as STIMPY on
WUS expression in the OC. Interestingly, we found that
CLV3 expression was not decreased in FAF overexpression lines, even though WUS levels were severely
reduced. Expression of WUS in the OC is under constant surveillance by several other positive and negative
regulators [reviewed in 1, 29]. For example, in jba-1 D
plants, a mutant in which the miR166g is overexpressed,
WUS expression is highly induced, while the relative
level of CLV3 transcription remains unchanged compared with wild-type plants [30]. These observations
together with data presented here suggest that the
expression of CLV3 is maintained over a wide range of
WUS levels, similar to what has been shown for the
effect of CLV3 on WUS [14]. In addition, several other
transcription factors, as well as a number of proteins
involved in chromatin remodelling, have been shown to
regulate WUS. Having established the FAF proteins as
negative regulators of WUS, it will be interesting to analyze possible genetic interactions between the FAF genes
and the other WUS regulators in detail.
WUS is not only expressed in the OC of the shoot
meristem, but also in young flower meristems, where it
directly regulates expression of the homeotic gene AGAMOUS (AG) in the centre of the newly formed flower
[31,32]. AG is normally required for the development of
the inner two whorls of the flower [33]. Reduction of
WUS expression in the flower meristem could result in
a downregulation of AG, which could explain the
observed defects in flowers of FAF overexpressing
plants.

FAF genes. (E) WUS, FAF2, and FAF4 are significantly upregulated
and change more than 2-fold (solid lines) in clv3-7, while FAF1 and
FAF3 do not (dashed lines). (F) FAF genes do not respond to ectopic
WUS expression. Scale bar: 100 μm.

Apart from defects in the shoot meristem, FAF overexpression resulted in an arrested root meristem. This
finding suggests that the FAF proteins can influence
meristem maintenance at both poles of the growing
plant. Since WUS is not expressed in the root meristem,
it will be interesting to investigate, which WOX gene
takes on its function in the root. STIMPY (STIP;
WOX9), a homeodomain transcription factor related to
WUS, has recently been shown to promote WUS
expression in the vegetative shoot meristem [16].
Based on the severity of loss-of-function alleles on both
the shoot and the root meristems, STIP seems to play a
more general role in meristem maintenance than WUS.
In this context it is interesting to note that, similar to
FAF overexpression, loss of STIP function can be compensated for by exogenous sucrose, which is in

Page 9 of 12

agreement with the proposed function for STIP in maintaining cell division. This suggests that STIP and the
FAFs might have opposing functions in integrating
sugar signalling into the meristem maintenance network.
The FAF proteins are likely to have functions other
than meristem maintenance since all are expressed in
vascular tissue. Consistent with a functional role for the
FAFs in these tissues, we observed a reduction of tertiary
and quaternary vein formation in FAF overexpressing
lines (data not shown). It has been reported that CLV1
and a CLV1-like gene are expressed in the phloem and
cambium. Also, two members of the CLAVATA3/ESRRELATED (CLE) family, CLE6 and CLE26, are preferentially expressed in the phloem and/or the cambium [34],
and it has recently been shown that application of dodecapeptides with two hydroxyproline residues encoded by
the CLE gene family suppress xylem cell differentiation
and promote cell division in Zinnia cell cultures [35].
Thus it seems possible that FAFs affect vascular development by a mechanism similar to the one we propose for
FAF function in the shoot meristem. In such a scenario
the FAF proteins would act as general repressors of cell
division in both the cambium and the root and shoot
meristem, but are themselves under the control of the
different CLAVATA/CLE proteins. Taken together our
findings suggest that FAF proteins might act as transcriptional regulators, the question how exactly they exert
their function remains to be determined.

Conclusions
Our study demonstrates that the four Arabidopsis thaliana FAF genes most likely arose from the FAF-like gene
present in both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous
plant species, through two rounds of gene duplications.
The expression of the FAF genes is under developmental regulation and individual FAF genes are expressed in
distinct, though overlapping domains. The latter suggests that the FAF proteins might act partially redundant, which would explain why T-DNA insertion lines
(as far as they could be confirmed) were indistinguishable from wild-type plants. Consistent with a certain
amount of redundancy among the FAF genes, RNAi and
artificial microRNAs to knock-down individual or at
maximum two FAF genes also did not result in any consistent and reproducible phenotypes. Based on the
expression of FAF2 and FAF4 in the centre of the shoot
apex, however, we assume a role of these two members
of the FAF family in the shoot meristem. Supporting
this idea was the finding that constitutive overexpression
of the FAF genes resulted in a marked reduction of meristem size. In addition, expression of WUS, a central
player in the regulation of meristem size was strongly
reduced in the FAF misexpression lines. Finally, expression of FAF2 and FAF4 themselves appear to be under

Wahl et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:285

the control of the WUS-CLV3 feedback loop, as these
two FAF genes were strongly induced in the meristem
of a clv3 mutant. Taken together, our data suggest a
scenario in which FAF2 and FAF4 modulate meristem
size while the function of the other two FAF genes
remains to be investigated.

Methods
Plant material

All lines analyzed were in the Columbia (Col-0) background. Plants were grown either under long day (LD,
16 h light, 8 h darkness) or short day (SD, 8 h light,
16 h darkness) conditions at 65% relative humidity
under a 2:1 mixture of Cool White (Sylvania, #0001510)
and Warm White (Sylvania, #0001511) fluorescent
lights, with a fluence rate of 125 to 175 μmol m-2s-1.
Phylogenetic analysis

Potential homologs of the Arabidopsis thaliana FAF and
FAF-like proteins were identified by reciprocal BLAST
analysis. First, we queried public databases (NCBI; Phytozome V4) using ‘tblastn’ and ‘blastp’ (E < 1e-5) to
identify potentially homologous proteins. Second, all
candidates were checked against TAIR 9 protein database by ‘blastp’. For this either the full length proteins
(when available) or the longest peptides encoded by the
various ESTs were used. Only proteins that resulted in
an Arabidopsis thaliana FAF or the FAF-like protein as
best hit were considered to be true FAF orthologs. For
phylogenetic analysis, FAF and FAF-like proteins were
preselected for maximum diversity. In particular, redundant sequences from the same or closely related species
were not considered and only one representative protein
sequence was included in the final tree. Peptides
deduced from ESTs were only considered if they completely covered the conserved domains that were eventually used to construct the phylogeny. The only
exception to this was a sequence originating from Selaginella moellendorffii (Phytozome-Id: 418746) that serves
as an outgroup, which contains only one of the two
regions that are conserved in all FAF and FAF-like proteins. Finally, the homologs of FAF proteins were
aligned with T-COFFEE [36], then only the conserved
domains were used for phylogenetic analysis. PAUP*
version 4.0b10 [37] was used to reconstruct the phylogenetic tree using the Neighbor-joining (NJ) method.
Topological robustness was assessed by bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates using simple taxon addition [38].
Analysis of microarray expression data

Microarray data were imported into the GeneSpring 7
software (Agilent Technologies) and normalized using
gcRMA, implemented in GeneSpring 7 [39]. Additional
‘per gene’ normalization was performed in GeneSpring

Page 10 of 12

7. Significant changes in gene expression were calculated
using logit-T with a cut-off of p < 0.025 [40]. Lists of
differentially expressed genes were imported into GeneSpring 7 for further analysis.
Molecular work and cloning

All constructs created in this study that involved PCR
were confirmed by DNA sequencing. See Additional
File 1 Table S6 for information on the sequences of the
oligonucleotides used. All four FAF genes are encoded
by single exon genes. For the construction of overexpressing lines, protein coding region were amplified
from genomic DNA and cloned into the pCRsmart vector, a derivative of pBluescript. ORFs were than cloned
as BamHI-PstI fragments into the shuttle vector
pBJ36-35 S. Cassettes containing the 35 S promoter, the
FAF ORF and the ocs terminator were excised from
the respective plasmids using NotI, ligated into the
pMLBART binary vector and transformed into Col0wild-type plants by floral dipping [41]. For the b-glucuronidase (GUS) reporters, 2.5 kb fragments upstream
of the FAF start codon were amplified by PCR, cloned
into the vector pRITA, which contains the GUS gene
followed by a nos terminator. The entire cassettes were
excised with NotI and ligated into the pMLBART binary
vector that provides resistance to the herbicide glufosinate (Basta, Bayer CropScience) in plants.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)

Tissue was fixed for 5 minutes in 100% methanol, followed by 3-5 washes with 100% ethanol. Further preparation was carried out as described [42]. Images were
acquired on a Hitachi S800 electron microscope, at an
accelerating voltage of 20 kV.
RNA in situ hybridization and GUS staining

RNA in situ hybridization was performed largely as previously described [42], but infiltration with paraffin was
carried out using an ASP300 automated embedding
apparatus (Leica). Sections (9-12 μm) were prepared
with an EG1160 microtome (Leica). Sense probes were
tested for all genes, but did not result in any noticeable
staining and were therefore omitted from most figures.
Sections shown in different panels in a given figure were
processed in parallel and the signal was allowed to
develop for the same time to ensure comparability.
Images were taken on an Axioplan2 microscope (Zeiss)
equipped with an AxioCam HRc (Zeiss) digital camera.
GUS staining was carried out as described [42]. Whole
mount preparations were examined under an MZ FLIII
(Leica) microscope and pictures were taken with an
AxioCam HRc digital camera (Zeiss). Thin sections of
tissues stained for GUS activity were prepared from paraffin embedded tissue as described above.

The width of the inflorescence meristem was determined on tissue sections stained with toluidine blue. For
this purpose, serial sections of the meristem were prepared
and the width of the meristem was determined from the
section that passed through the centre of the meristem.
The average meristem width and the standard deviation
were calculated based on measurements of 15 meristems.
