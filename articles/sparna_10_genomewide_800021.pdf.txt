primary murine hepatocytes

Abstract
Background: Cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IL-1beta are known for their contribution to inflammatory processes
in liver. In contrast, the cytokine IL-17 has not yet been assigned a role in liver diseases. IL-17 can cooperate with
TNF-alpha to induce a synergistic response on several target genes in different cell lines, but no data exist for
primary hepatocytes. To enhance our knowledge on the impact of IL-17 alone and combined with TNF-alpha in
primary murine hepatocytes a comprehensive microarray study was designed. IL-1beta was included as this
cytokine is suggested to act in a similar manner as the combination of TNF-alpha and IL-17, especially with respect
to its role in mRNA stabilization.
Results: The present microarray analysis demonstrates that primary murine hepatocytes responded to IL-17
stimulation by upregulation of chemokines and genes, which are functionally responsible to increase and sustain
inflammation. Cxcl2, Nfkbiz and Zc3h12a were strongly induced, whereas the majority of the genes were only very
moderately up-regulated. Promoter analysis revealed involvement of NF-kappaB in the activation of many genes.
Combined stimulation of TNF-alpha/IL-17 resulted in enhanced induction of gene expression, but significantly
synergistic effects could be applied only to a few genes, such as Nfkbiz, Cxcl2, Zc3h12 and Steap4. Comparison of
the gene expression profile obtained after stimulation of TNF-alpha/IL-17 versus IL-1beta proposed an “IL-1beta-like
effect” of the latter cytokine combination. Moreover, evidence was provided that modulation of mRNA stability
may be a major mechanism by which IL-17 regulates gene expression in primary hepatocytes. This assumption was
exemplarily proven for Nfkbiz mRNA for the first time in hepatocytes. Our studies also suggest that RNA stability
can partially be correlated to the existence of AU rich elements, but further mechanisms like the RNase activity of
the up-regulated Zc3h12a have to be considered.
Conclusions: Our microarray analysis gives new insights in IL-17 induced gene expression in primary hepatocytes
highlighting the crosstalk with the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. Gene expression profile suggests IL-17 alone and
in concert with TNF-alpha a role in sustaining liver inflammatory processes. IL-17 might exceed this function by
RNA stabilization.

Background
The liver is an important organ with high regenerative
potential and complex functions. Regeneration occurs
through growth factor- and cytokine-mediated proliferation of differentiated hepatocytes [1]. In the priming
phase of liver regeneration induced by partial

hepatectomy or mitogenic effects, TNF-a and IL-6 are
involved, whereas IL-1b is known to be a potent inhibitor of hepatocyte proliferation. Overall, these cytokines
are known for their proinflammatory properties contributing to inflammatory processes which also precede
liver regeneration [1-4]. Recently, interleukin-17 (IL17A) has stepped in the limelight as a further interesting
proinflammatory cytokine produced predominantly by a
distinct class of Th lymphocytes, the Th17 cells. IL-17 is
thought to be important for host defence against

bacterial infection and plays a significant role in local
tissue inflammation through modulating cytokine and
especially chemokine production by various cells. Evidence was provided that neutrophil recruitment is
mediated through upregulation of chemokine expression
on target cells like epithelial cells [5,6]. Interestingly,
studies in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma
revealed a higher number of IL-17 expressing lymphocytes in tumor tissue [7], which correlates with reduced
survival [8], suggesting IL-17 a tumor promoting role.
Moreover, IL-17 was demonstrated to be dramatically
increased in patients with alcoholic liver disease [9],
where it is discussed as a key feature important for liver
neutrophil recruitment. However, IL-17 has not yet
been assigned a role in liver regeneration. Altogether, its
moderate influence on gene expression suggests that it
rather sustains, than induces inflammatory processes
[10]. Interestingly, blocking of IL-17 prior to systemic
TNF-a application, protects mice from TNF-a induced
systemic inflammatory response syndrome [11].
The latter observation points to the fact that IL-17 can
cooperate with TNF-a to induce a synergistic response
on several target genes which has been shown in various
cell lines [12,13]. However, no data exist for primary
hepatocytes or any hepatoma cell line in this respect,
therefore further information is needed. Microarray data
exist upon stimulation with IL-17 for human vascular
smooth muscle cells [14], bronchial epithel cells [5,15],
and upon TNF-a/IL-17 stimulation for the preosteoblast
cell line MC3T-E1, ST2 and MEFs [12], human rheumatoid arthritis synoviocytes [13,16], MEFs and HeLa cell
lines [17]. Strikingly, chemokines always belong to the
most prominently expressed genes.
Almost all known IL-17 target genes are also regulated
by IL-1b and TLR ligands, such as LPS, suggesting an
overlap of parts of their signaling pathways. Computational analysis of 18 IL-17 target gene promoters
revealed binding sites for the transcription factors NFB, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP), AP1
and OCT1 as over-represented. However, joint occurrence of NF-B and C/EBP is not a common feature of
all IL-17 genes [12,18] Thus, genes with an immunoregulatory function possess binding sites for both, whereas
promoters from chemokines do not commonly have C/
EBP, AP1 or OCT1, but NF-B sites [18]. IL-17 is
somewhat different from classical NF-B activators, as it
induces a weak NF-B DNA binding activity and surprisingly could not activate NF-B reporter gene constructs transfected in several cell lines [6].
Furthermore, IL-17 is known to influence gene expression by modulating RNA stability [17] which can be correlated to the occurrence of AU-rich elements (ARE)
mostly in the 3’ untranslated region of the mRNA.
These sequences represent interaction sites for stability

modulating proteins like Zfp36 (encoding tristetraprolin)
[6,19-21]. Although the underlying mechanism for the
potent synergy of IL-17 with TNF-a is not well understood it is presumed that IL-17 is involved in enhancement of transcript stability, particularly in those genes
containing AREs.
As no data exist for primary hepatocytes on the influence of IL-17 and its potent synergy with TNF-a, both
very important proinflammatory cytokines, a study was
designed to identify hepatocyte specific gene expression
changes induced by IL-17 alone and in combination
with TNF-a. Moreover, analyses were carried out to elucidate the possible impact of IL-17 on the modulation of
mRNA stability. As the used cytokines belong to the
group of pro-inflammatory mediators, the results
obtained may increase our knowledge of the complex
signaling network contributing to the development of
inflammatory liver diseases.

Results and Discussion
Primary hepatocytes were stimulated with TNF-a
(2 ng/ml) alone or in combination with IL-17 (100 ng/ml)
following the protocol of [12] for 1 and 4 h respectively, in
order to observe changes in early as well as delayed gene
expression profiles. For a detailed overview on the experimental setup please refer to Additional file 1, Table S1.
Titration experiments revealed 100 ng/ml of recombinant
IL-17 to be sufficient for maximal induction (data not
shown). Both cytokine concentrations have been evaluated
in advance by determining their capacity to induce mRNA
expression levels of the hallmark target genes IL6, Nfkbiz
and iNOS in response to different concentrations alone or
in combination. We also included stimulation of primary
hepatocytes with IL-1b in the same experimental
approach. We chose IL-1b, because this cytokine might
act in a similar way as the combination of TNF-a and IL17 by initiating transcription via NF-B as well as stabilizing short-lived mRNA possessing enhanced numbers of
ARE [17]. Since previous observations revealed an ongoing
cultural adaptation process accompanied with distinct
changes in gene expression (Zellmer et al. unpublished
data), gene profiles of untreated cells were recorded for
both time points as time-matched references, a procedure
different to conventional analyses.
A two-way analysis of variance for repeated measures
(rANOVA) with factors time (1 h, 4 h) and treatment
(control, IL1b, TNF-a, IL-17, TNF-a/IL-17) was performed to identify genes which are regulated by any of
the investigated cytokines. 1631 probe sets (representing
1341 genes) were regulated (factor treatment, ST qvalue < 0.045), 13357 probe sets were not significantly
influenced and 30113 probe sets were excluded from
the analysis because they contained low quality results
(quality p-value ≥ 0.05 according to MAS5) in at least

one of the experiments. To dissect which of the cytokines is responsible for the regulation of which genes,
the 1631 regulated probe sets were subjected to further
mathematical analysis. For each cytokine treatment a
separate two-way rANOVA with factors time (1 h, 4 h)
and treatment (control 1 h, 4 h, cytokine) was performed. The regulated genes were separated in two
groups (up-regulated by cytokine, downregulated by
cytokine) using a K-means cluster algorithm [22]. The
results with the respective up-regulated genes are
depicted in Figure 1 and Table 1. 903 probe sets were

inflammation as well as several chemokines were found
among the most strongly up-regulated ones. Accordingly,
the search for overrepresented GO terms revealed “inflammatory response” as most significant (Fisher’s Exact test,
p-value = 1.5E-5) confirming previous observations in
murine embryonic fibroblasts and osteoblasts [12]. In line
with the observations reported by [12] the data presented
herein indicate that in primary hepatocytes IL-17 itself is a
weak inductor of gene expression compared to cytokines,
such as TNF-a. This was similar with our study in primary
hepatocytes, as only 11 probe sets (representing 8 genes)
reached a fold induction of >2 fold at 1 h and 18 probe
sets (representing 13 genes) at 4 h by IL-17 treatment. In
contrast, in rheumatoid arthritis synoviocytes a microarray
study revealed about 600 genes significantly regulated by
two IL-17 isoforms after 12 h of stimulation [13].
To focus on genes with substantial differential regulatory response towards IL-17, only probe sets reaching a
standard deviation (SD) >0.4 in their fold induction
ratios (measured over all experiments) were hierarchically clustered (42 probe sets = 35 genes) (see Figure 2).
As NF-B plays a crucial role for transcriptional regulation of genes expressed in the course of an inflammatory process, these genes were analyzed for NF-B
binding sites. Based on a literature or a bioinformatics
approach several of the genes analyzed were identified
as NF-B target genes (see Figure 2, details on the generation of the lists can be found in Additional file 1).
As depicted in Figure 2 three genes of the cluster,
namely Cxcl2 (also termed as MIP-2), NFkbiz and
Zc3h12a, possessed unique regulatory properties, while
the majority exhibits more homogeneously regulated
expression profiles. The proinflammatory chemokine

Cxcl2, which orchestrates neutrophil recruitment to
inflammatory foci is known to be strongly induced by
IL-1b [23] and to comprise a NF-B binding site within
its 5’ regulatory region [24], but is only weakly up-regulated by IL-17 (1 h stimulation: 3.9 fold, 4 h: 4.9 fold
upregulation). Contrariwise, the immediate early gene
Nfkbiz (IBzeta), which is also known to be strongly
induced by IL-1b [25] is also significantly upregulated
by stimulation with IL-17 for 1 h (p = 1 h: 11.0 fold, 4
h: 8.3 fold), whereas Zc3h12a (= Monocyte chemotactic
protein-1 induced protein, MCPIP-1) is strongly upregulated by IL-17 and this even surmounts induction
by IL-1b, when assessed after 4 h stimulation (1 h: 6.4
fold, 4 h: 15.3 fold). Accordingly, the genes Zc3h12a
(p-value = 2.8E-7, ST q-value = 4.9E-5) and Nfkbiz
(p-value = 3.6E-5, ST q-value = 2.2E-3) show the highest
p-values for IL-17 dependent gene expression in the
rANOVA. Nfkbiz is a well known IL-17 target gene
[12,26], whereas Zc3h12a has not yet been described as
IL-17 dependent gene, but as NF-B regulated [27].
Interestingly, both genes also display properties of a
transcription factor [28-30].
When analyzing the remaining genes three subgroups
can be distinguished from which two of them contain
genes characterized in literature as immediately early
genes (IEG) [31,32]. These genes are considered to
require no de novo protein synthesis for upregulation of
expression [33], presumably due to the regulation of
preexisting transcription factors [33,34] and alleviated
chromosomal accessibility [35]. The first group consists
of the chemokines Cxcl1, Ccl2 as well as the transcription factors/inhibitors Nfkbia (IBa), Cish and Ier3.
Except for Cish, a transcription factor belonging to the

Figure 2 Hierarchical clustering of 35 genes up-regulated by IL-17 in primary hepatocytes. Two way rANOVA analyses were performed to
identify genes up-regulated by IL-17. Genes with enhanced differential gene regulation between different cytokine stimulations were identified
by filtering for a minimum SD >0.4. 42 out of the 92 probe sets identified by ANOVA remained and are presented in the dendrogram. NF-B
target genes are indicated by a star (*) for literature derived annotation or a dot (.) for bioinformatical annotation next to the gene symbol (for
building the NF-B lists refer to Additional file 1).

SOCS-family, all genes are known and predicted as NFB driven genes, suggesting that NF-B is the major
transcriptional regulator of this group. The second subgroup contains genes encoding for the adhesion molecule Vcam1 and the NF-B inhibitor Tnfaip3 (A20),
which are also thought to be NF-B target genes. Notably, IBa and A20 are important negative feedback regulators of NF-B signaling and are crucial for damping
the proinflammatory activity. Except of Ccl2 all genes in
these two groups contain AREs. The third subgroup
includes Tlr2, Tnfaip2 (B94), both known as NF-kB target genes, and Steap4.
To analyze if IL-17 up-regulated genes are regulated
by RNA stability modulation via AREs in primary
hepatocytes, the 42 probe sets were screened for
presence of AREs using the ARES3 database [36]
http://brp.kfshrc.edu.sa/ARED/ (see Figure 2). From
these probes ten genes could be annotated as ARE comprising genes. Interestingly, Nfkbiz was not annotated by
the database, but was experimentally shown to be regulated by RNA stabilization related to the 3’UTR [37].
However, AREs do not preferentially occur in the group
of highly regulated IL-17 target genes, but rather seem
to be a common feature within the gene sets up-regulated by IL-17, as a comparable fraction of ARE annotated genes was identified for all 92 probe sets (81
genes) by the rANOVA.

Besides its impact on transcript stability of those genes
harbouring AREs within their non-coding regulatory
regions, IL-17 may also be involved in an alternative
mechanism by which RNA stability is controlled. Thus,
studies suggest, that the transcript stability of IL-17 target genes, such as Nfkbiz and Cxcl1, is ARE-independently regulated by alternative regulatory sequences
located in the 3’UTR of these genes [38,39]. This could
be particularly due to marked IL-17-mediated upregulation of the RNase Zc3h12a, which was shown to be
responsible for the RNA decay of a subset of proinflammatory mediators comprising genes such as IL-6 [40].
This participation in IL-6 regulation places Zc3h12a
into a central role for liver regeneration and liver repair
as IL-6 is of critical relevance for an undisturbed course
of these processes.
The rANOVA also revealed 126 probe sets which
were downregulated by IL-17 treatment. Here, most
genes show weak expression changes when compared to
control. When applying the SD >0.4 filter only 17 genes
remained, including Nalp12, a gene suppressing inflammatory responses in monocytes, Dusp22, which
enhances IL-6 induced STAT3 dependent transcription,
when downregulated [41], and connective tissue growth
factor (Ctgf), which inhibits adipocyte differentiation
[42]. The observed downregulation of immunosuppressive genes is in accordance with the primarily

proinflammatory function of IL-17. When annotating
the genes for NF-B TFBS, a lower number of NF-B
target genes (10.3% (Fisher’s Exact Test: p-value = 0.88))
were detected compared to the fraction of the up-regulated genes (29.1% (Fisher’s Exact Test: p-value =
0.000013)) (based on the bioinformatical promoter analysis approach, described in Methods). Using the literature based list only 2% of the downregulated cluster
compared to 23% of the up-regulated genes were annotated to contain NF-B TFBS (Data in Additional file 2,
Table S2). Promoter analysis revealed overrepresentation
for 3 NF-B related PFMs (V$NFKB65_01, p-Value >
7.88E-05, V$NFKB_Q6 p-value > 0.0006, MA0107, pvalue > 0.001) and for an AP1 PFM (MA0003, p-value >
0.004).
IL-17 induced genes in relation to the cytokines TNF-a
and IL-1b

In order to gain an overview on gene expression in primary hepatocytes induced by the combination of TNF-a
and IL-17 and to analyze possible relationships between
TNF-a and IL-1b induced gene expression, treatment
effect of the single cytokines and the combination of
TNF-a/IL-17 was studied. In the following at first genes
up-regulated by IL-17 are compared with that ones
induced by the combination of IL-17/TNF-a and subsequently subgroups with genes up-regulated by various
stimuli.
IL-17 induced genes in relation to IL-17/TNF-a

Direct comparison between the set of genes induced by
IL-17 with that one up-regulated by the combination of
IL-17/TNF-a, identifies similar gene-sets, while the
cytokine-combination induces the majority to a higher
degree (see Additional file 3, Table S3). To identify
synergistically induced genes, the cooperative index as
described by [13] was calculated. Among all significantly
up-regulated genes, only Nfkbiz and Cxcl2 genes turned
out to be synergistically induced after 1 h, and three
genes (Cxcl2, Zc3h12a and Steap4) after 4 h (Additional
file 4, Table S4). Additionally, Gm1960 which encodes
for Cxcl3, a chemokine similar to Cxcl2, was also
detected to be synergistically up-regulated at 4 h [43].
This small number of genes indicates, that in the case of
TNF-a and IL-17 synergistic induction may not play a
prominent role in gene expression in primary hepatocytes. This differs from those data reported for synoviocytes isolated from patients with rheumatoid arthritis
where in total 130 genes were detected to be synergistically regulated after 12 h of stimulation [13].
Genes significantly up-regulated by IL-1b, TNF-a, IL-17 and
IL-17/TNF-a

41 genes (48 probe sets) were identified to be up-regulated by all stimuli representing a gene group which is

Page 6 of 14

commonly up-regulated in hepatocytes in different
inflammatory responses. Accordingly, GO analysis
revealed “inflammatory response” as overrepresented
term with a p-value < 10-6 (Additional file 5, Table S5)
and 53% of the genes were confirmed or predicted as
NF-B target genes (Table 1). The importance of NF-B
is underlined by the fact that the most significantly upregulated TFBS are assigned to position frequency
matrices of different NF-B subunits or heterodimers
(Additional file 6, Table S6).
To get a more clearly structured picture probe sets
were filtered for SD >0.4 and subjected to hierarchical
clustering. Expression ratios are presented as heat map
(see Figure 3). Interestingly, several genes up-regulated
by IL-1b at 4 h showed a similar expression as genes
induced by TNF-a/IL-17 at 4 h (see also Additional
file 3, S3). This correlation was not observed for genes
already up-regulated after 1 h of IL-1b treatment. To
evaluate if IL-17 in addition to TNF-a will cause a
shift towards a more “IL-1b like” gene expression, the
Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated between
IL-1b (4 h) and TNF-a (4 h) or the combination of
TNF-a/IL-17 (4 h), respectively (based on the fold
induction ratios of the 48 probe sets) [44]. A coefficient of 0.69 was calculated for TNF-a versus IL-1b
and increased to 0.92 by costimulation with IL-17/
TNF-a (see Additional file 7, Figure S1). IL-17 alone
was not sufficient for the increased correlation
observed (see Additional file 7, Figure S1B). Interestingly, when all probe sets of the chip were taken into
account a slightly lower coefficient of 0.79 was
obtained between IL-1b and IL-17/TNF-a (see Additional File 7, Figure S3). Thus, it can be assumed that
in the presence of IL-17 a subset of genes up-regulated
by TNF-a may shift the expression profile towards
“IL-1b like” properties [17]. This shift seems to be
rather due to additional than synergistical effects.
Looking for common features within the subset of these
48 genes two groups can be distinguished: Immediate
early type genes displaying characteristic high expression
values for IL-1b 1 h data points (e.g. Cxcl2, Tnfaip3,
Ier3) and delayed genes (e.g. Cd14, Cd44, Steap4), which
are up-regulated just after 4 h of IL-1b stimulation.
Interestingly, Zc3h12a was markedly up-regulated (>30
fold after 4 h TNF-a/IL-17 stimulation), whereas Zfp36
encoding for tristetraprolin, one of the best understood
RNA stability modulating factors in liver and a close
family member to Zc3h12a, was only weakly induced
(<2 fold for all stimulations). In case of Zfp36 its
degrading effects on RNA are well known [45-47]
whereas this property has been reported for Zc3h12a
only recently [40]. The fact, that Zfp36 and Zc3h12a
belong to the same family and possess structural

similarity, but have different target mRNAs shows that
regulation of RNA stability occurs in a comprehensive
network. It therefore can be speculated that Zc3h12a
represents a mechanism for IL-17 mediated differential
gene expression. Since these findings assume Zc3h12a
to be of special interest in hepatocytes we performed a
detailed qRT-PCR analysis of RNA induction by the different stimuli (see Additional file 8, Figure S4).

probe sets mapping to 77 genes) similarities with the
subset of the 48 probe sets up-regulated by all stimuli

only moderate for all genes, since most strongly up-

stimuli” subset. Again, the Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated for these probe sets and a coefficient of 0.27 was obtained for the 4 h stimulated probe
sets (IL-1b versus TNF-a), which increased, as expected,
to 0.92 when IL-1b was correlated versus IL-17/TNF-a
(see Additional file 7, Figure S2). Hence, the hypothesis
of the “IL-1b like effect” for TNF-a combined with IL17 might also be applied for this gene group. It seems
that the underlying mechanism needs some time to fully
modulate gene expression, since the correlation after 1
h of stimulation was significantly lower (0.61, IL-1b versus IL-17/TNF-a, data not shown).
GO analysis did not show an overrepresentation of
inflammatory response for this group of genes (Fisher’s
Exact Test: p > 0.2). Instead, nucleocytoplasmic transport (p < 0.0005), cell death (p < 0.0008) and acute
phase response (p < 0.003) were among the most highly
over-represented biological processes (See Additional
file 5, Table S7). Promoter analysis revealed AP-2 as the
top over-represented TFBS (p < 5.9E-5). None of the
NF-B PFMs was significantly over-represented (p >
0.05 for all NF-B PFMs).
Further cluster analysis (filter SD >0.4) showed only
one characteristic subgroup with high expression after
TNF-a/IL-17 and IL-1b stimulation at 4 h (top rows in
Additional file 9, Figure S5). This gene set included
genes related to acute phase response, such as hepcidin
(Hamp1), Oncostatin M receptor (Osmr), suppressor of
cytokine signaling (Socs3), and serum amyloid A, but
altogether, only a restricted number of acute phase proteins were detected, an observation which may be due
to the time window used.
Another gene of this subgroup which might be of
interest is Tnfrsf1b encoding for tumor necrosis factor
receptor superfamily member1b since it may indicate a
positive regulatory loop. This may in part contribute to
the potentiating effect of IL-17/TNF-a as already suggested for TNFRII in human rheumatoid arthritis synoviocytes [13]. However, this regulatory effect should
become more obvious at later time points which have
not been studied here.
IL-1b, IL-17, and TNF-a/IL-17, but not TNF-a up-regulated
genes with Nfkbiz as prominent representative

Genes of this group (12 probe sets representing 9 genes)
are closely related to the previous group and are characterized by a weak TNF-a inducibility. Cluster analysis
revealed as the most prominent member with significant
up-regulated gene expression Nfkbiz (encoding IBzeta),
the gene mentioned above (see Additional file 10, Figure
S6 and Table 1). Nfkbiz was also shown to be mainly upregulated by IL-1b, but not by TNF-a [48]. Further genes
include the transcription factors Cebpd, Vanin3 (Vnn3),
Rho family GTPase 3 (Rnd3) and Adamts1.

Nfkbiz can function as transcription factor being also
involved in nucleosomal opening thereby directly influencing target gene accessibility and regulation [49].
Nfkbiz is also reported to act in a cofactor like manner
by interacting with p50/p65 or p50 homodimers
[30,50-52]. Recently, a correlation was demonstrated to
exist between Nfkbiz and the transcription factor C/
EBPδ (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein) in MEF cells
[53]. Additionally, Nfkbiz and C/EBPs were proven to
induce a subset of genes by cooperating with one
another in HEK293 cells and osteoblasts derived cells
[54,55]. Among the 9 up-regulated target genes is
Cebpd, which in turn is required for de novo translation of Nfkbiz. To which extend this feed forward loop
may influence target gene expression in hepatocytes
and which consequences may result from Nfkbiz
dependent gene regulation has to be clarified in future
studies.
TNF-a and IL-17 synergistically induce Nfkbiz mRNA
expression independently of NF-B

To verify the expression data of Nfkbiz obtained by the
microarray, qRT-PCR analysis were performed. Primary
hepatocytes were treated with TNF-a, IL-17 or the combination of both for different times up to 8 h and subsequently Nfkbiz mRNA levels were measured. Figure 4A
confirms for hepatocytes that TNF-a alone results in a
very weak induction of Nfkbiz gene expression whereas
IL-17 leads to an increased expression with a peak at
1.5 h and 8 h. Strikingly, IL-17 in combination with
TNF-a leads to a synergistical increase in transcript
expression. mRNA levels remain elevated up to 4 h and
show a second induction phase at 8 h. This is consistent
with our microarray data (see Table 2 and Figure 4C).
Furthermore, IL-1b induced Nfkbiz mRNA expression
was verified and compared to the other stimuli. Figure
4B shows a similar kinetic induced by IL-1b as it has
been shown for TNF-a and IL-17. Note that microarray
analyses have been performed at 1 and 4 hours and
therefore the maximum peak might not have been
detected at these time points. Taken together qRT-PCR
data could nicely verify the microarray data.
To test whether synergistic activation of transcription
factor NF-B is involved in IL-17/TNF-a induced upregulation of Nfkbiz, we performed NF-B EMSAs with
nuclear extracts of primary mouse hepatocytes. NF-B
DNA binding was markedly increased after treatment
with TNF-a but only very slightly after IL-17 treatment.
Interestingly, cells stimulated with the combination of
both cytokines showed no increase in NF-B DNA
binding compared to cells treated with TNF-a alone
(Data not shown)
These findings are in agreement with previous reports
where the combination of IL-17/TNF-a did not induce

a greater transcriptional initiation than TNF-a alone on
CXCL1 expression in MEF 3T3 cells [17] suggesting
that IL-17 mediates its effects on gene expression on
the level of transcript stability.
IL-17 increases the t1/2 of Nfkbiz mRNA

To determine the effect of IL-17 and TNF-a on mRNA
stabilization we first measured the half life time of Nfkbiz
RNA itself. Figure 5A shows the decay of Nfkbiz RNA
over time and reveals a half life time of 34.36 minutes
calculated by one phase decay non-linear regression.
Then the ability of the two cytokines and their combination to stabilize Nfkbiz mRNA was tested.

Therefore, primary hepatocytes were incubated with
IL-17 and/or TNF-a for 30 minutes, subsequently actinomycin D was added to block further transcription.
After incubation for the indicated times Nfkbiz mRNA
levels were determined and plotted against time. Figure
5B clearly shows that TNF-a alone is not able to significantly modulate the t 1/2 of Nfkbiz mRNA (24.56
minutes after TNF-a treatment). In contrast, IL-17
prolongs the half life time up to 87.26 minutes and the
combination of IL-17/TNF-a also stabilized Nfkbiz
mRNA and resulted in a t1/2 of 80.47 minutes. These
findings indicate that IL-17 is able to stabilize Nfkbiz
transcripts and prolongs the mRNA half life time to

Figure 5 IL-17 increases the half life time of Nfkbiz mRNA by modulating RNA stability. (A) Cells were incubated with actinomycin D (5
μg/ml) to stop further transcription and Nfkbiz mRNA levels were determined after the indicated times. To calculate the RNA half life time (34.36
minutes) results were expressed as % remaining RNA over time and one phase decay curves were applied. (B) Influence of cytokines was tested
by incubation of primary hepatocytes with IL-17 (100 ng/ml) for 30 minutes with or without additional TNF-a (2 ng/ml) stimulation or TNF-a

plotted and analyzed as described above. RNA half life time was calculated and shows a remarkable increase up to 87.26 minutes induced by IL17 and 80.47 minutes by IL-17/TNF-a compared to 24.56 minutes induced by TNF-a treatment alone. Data represent means +/- SD of at least

more than the double of its original time. Thus, we
could demonstrate for the first time in hepatocytes
that IL-17 treatment enhances Nfkbiz mRNA stability.
Previously, this was shown for several genes in MEFS
[17] and for Nfkbiz in NIH3T3 cells [37]. Importantly,
the conclusion that enhancement of mRNA stability
may be a major mechanism by which IL-17 regulate
gene expression can also be applied to primary
hepatocytes.

Conclusions
The present microarray analysis demonstrates for the
first time that primary murine hepatocytes are also sensitive to short term IL-17 stimulation corroborating the
assumption that hepatocytes also participate and are
functionally influenced in the context of an inflammatory
response. Hepatocytes show a rather low induction of
gene expression level, as it is also observed for fibroblasts,
muscle and epithelial cells, whereas rheumatoid arthritis
synoviocytes show upregulation of a higher number of
genes following IL-17 stimulation [13]. In agreement
with the literature [12] combined stimulation of TNF-a/
IL-17 resulted in enhanced induction of gene expression,
but significantly synergistic effects could be applied only
to few genes, especially to chemokines. Here, gene
expression of Cxcl1 and Cxcl2 deserves special interest
because of their function to attract neutrophils and lymphocytes thereby contributing to inflammatory processes
and to the control of the composition of the immune
competent cells recruited [6]. However, a substantial
enhancement of pro-inflammatory genes was observed

providing additional evidence that IL-17 may play an
important role in supporting and sustaining inflammatory conditions including inflammatory liver diseases.
Promoter analysis unambiguously revealed that NF-B
is involved in the activation of many IL-17 target genes
related to inflammation, especially in that ones with a
high expression level. Although C/EBP is also described
to have binding sites in close proximity to NF-B TFBS,
promoter analysis did not reveal its significant overrepresentation. However, Cebpd was found among the 9 most
up-regulated genes following 4 h of TNF-a/IL-17 combined stimulation. This discrepancy may be explained
that C/EBP regulated genes are not yet up-regulated at
the chosen time point in our microarray analysis.
One of the most up-regulated genes turned out to be
Nfkbiz (encoding IBzeta) which was only slightly
induced following TNF-a stimulation, but reached
nearly the level observed for IL-1b after costimulation
with IL-17/TNF-a. IBζ can function as transcription
factor and is involved in gene accessibility [49]. Therefore, it can be assumed that Nfkbiz may play an important role in fine tuning proinflammatory responses and
influencing the downregulation and duration of inflammatory reactions in hepatocytes. Moreover, Nfkbiz when
deregulated may even pave the way for malignancy,
which may in part explain the oncogenic potential of
IL-17 [56].
Our literature and bioinformatics based approach
provides evidence that modulation of mRNA stability
may also be a major mechanism by which IL-17 regulates gene expression in primary hepatocytes. Using

Sparna et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:226
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/226

Nfkbiz as prominent example this assumption was
experimentally confirmed for the first time in hepatocytes. RNA stability can partly be correlated to the
existence and number of ARE [31]. This is obviously
the case when genes are highly up-regulated, such as
chemokines. However, alternative proteins may be
involved, as mRNA of Nfkbiz was shown to be controlled by a sequence located in the 3’ untranslated
region of the mRNA independently from the also present AREs [39]. A prominent candidate being
involved in mRNA stability may be the RNase
Zc3h12a which was shown here to be highly induced
in primary hepatocytes and which is reported to be
responsible for destabilization of the IL-6 mRNA in
macrophages [40]. Interestingly, tristetraproline
(Zfp36), one of the best understood RNA modulating
factors in liver and a close family member to Zc3h12a
seems not to play a significant role in the time window examined, since its RNA was not significantly
induced. Altogether, our microarray analysis gives
new insights how IL-17 may contribute to early
inflammatory events in hepatocytes underlining again
the importance of this cytokine in inflammatory diseases, and especially in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases of the liver.

Methods
Isolation and cultivation of primary hepatocytes

Primary hepatocytes from six mice were prepared and
cells from two mice were pooled, respectively, seeded in
collagen coated six well plates and cultured according to
SOP reported by [57]. Each set of pooled cells were
treated with IL-1beta (1 or 4 h), TNF-alpha (1 or 4 h),
IL-17 (1.5 and 4.5 h) or IL-17 (0.5 h) followed by TNFa (1 h or 4 h). Thus, three biological replicates were
performed. Details of experimental conditions, stimulation and an experimental design are described in Additional file 1.
Hepatocyte isolation from these mice was approved by
the animal experimental committees and animals were
handled and housed according to specific pathogen free
(SPF) conditions.
RNA preparation

RNA preparation was based on anion exchange chromatography (RNEasy, Qiagen) as described in Additional
file 1.
Target labeling, hybridization and microarray processing

Performance was done according to the manufacturer’s
directions (Affymetrix Inc.) by the Microarray Core
Facility, University Clinic, Mannheim. The mouse
whole genome 430 V2 Affymetrix microarray was used
for hybridization. Details of the procedure are available

Page 11 of 14

from the Microarray Core Facility web-site at http://
www.ma.uni-heidelberg.de/inst/zmf/affymetrix/.
mRNA stability

To determine the half life time of Nfkbiz mRNA, cells
were incubated with actinomycin D (5 μg/ml, Alexis) for
the indicated times to inhibit further transcription. Then
total RNA was extracted and Nfkbiz mRNA expression
quantified by qRT-PCR. Results are presented as %
remaining mRNA compared to mRNA levels of
untreated cells. To measure mRNA stability in response
to cytokine treatment cells were stimulated with TNF-a
(2 ng/ml), IL-17 (100 ng/ml) or the combination of both
in the presence of actinomycin D whereas IL-17 was
preincubated for 30 minutes. Nfkbiz mRNA expression
was again quantified by qRT-PCR after the indicated
times and relative mRNA abundance was calculated by
setting the values of the Nfkbiz mRNA levels induced
by 30 minutes IL-17 preincubation to 100%. Percentages
were plotted against time, one phase decay curves were
calculated (GraphPad Prism 5) and the time to 50%
mRNA decay was deduced. Means of three independent
experiments are presented.
Expression data processing

Mouse430V2 Affymetrix CEL data files were uploaded
into Expressionist Refiner Array® version 4.5 (Genedata
AG, Basel, Switzerland) for data condensation. Oligo
hybridization intensities were condensed to probe set
expression values using the MAS5 Affymetrix Statistical
algorithm according to [58]. Condensed data were normalized using Expressionist Analyst® version 4.5 (Genedata AG, Basel, Switzerland). Absolute probe set
expression values were scaled on the chip level by logarithmic mean normalization (for each chip, the logarithmic mean of all probe set values was scaled to 10000).
Hierarchical clustering of experiments revealed systematic expression differences for the three biological replicates of the mouse hepatocyte cultures (= factor series).
To compensate for these systematic differences, data
from each of the three replicate series were separately
standardized on the probe set level by point-wise division
(for each probe set and series, the median of the probe
set values of all experimental conditions (Control, IL-17,
TNF-a, IL-17/TNF-a, IL-1b) was standardized to 1).
Data points with a quality p-value > = 0.05 according to
MAS5 were excluded from further analyses. The expression data are publically available in the NCBI GEO
database under series accession GSE19272 http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/.
Expression data analyses

Two-way analyses of variance for repeated measures
(rANOVA) were performed in Expressionist Analyst to

Sparna et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:226
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/226

identify differentially expressed probe sets (factors treatment and time; probe sets with missing values with
respect to the experiment scope of the respective
ANOVA were excluded from the analysis). The significance level was set at a < 0.01. The corresponding false
discovery rates (FDR, Storey-Tibshirani (ST) q-values,
[59] are reported in the result section. Probe sets jointly
regulated by two or more cytokine treatments were
identified by intersecting groups of regulated genes
determined by the ANOVAs. Fold factors were calculated from the geometric means of the three biological
replicates of each condition versus the time matched
control.
Promoter analysis

Transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) were predicted
for murine (NCBI mouse genome version 33) promoter
regions (-5000 to +500 bp with respect to the transcription start site) on a genome-wide scale using Genedata
Phylosopher® version 6.5 Promoter Explorer (PE). PE
predicts TFBSs based on a phylogenetic footprinting
approach using normalised position frequency matrices
(PFM) by three filtering steps. (1) Identification of conserved subregions within orthologous promoters of phylogenetically related genomes (NCBI mouse genome
version 33 vs. NCBI human genome version 34). The
conservation threshold was set to 70% identity within
50 bp sliding windows. (2) Identification of candidate
binding sites by screening the conserved promoter subregions for consensus with PFMs (using default settings). PFMs were derived from TRANSFAC® (version
3.2, [60,61]. (3) Further filtering of candidate binding
sites for significantly enhanced consensus as compared
to random DNA sequences having the same nucleotide
fractions (A, T, G and C content) as the respective promoter region (bootstrapping p-value < 0.0001).
List of NF-B target genes

NF-B target genes were identified as described in
Additional file 1.
Biological context analyses

Over-representation of biological processes [62]; http://
www.geneontology.org and of TFBSs (based on TFBS
predictions as described in section Promoter analysis) in
gene groups of interest was estimated by Fishers’ Exact
tests using Expressionist Analyst. The mapping from
probe sets to genes was performed using the Phylosopher seqmap tool based on the NCBI mouse genome
version 33.
