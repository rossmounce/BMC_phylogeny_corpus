Abstract
Background: Cereulide, a depsipeptide structurally related to valinomycin, is responsible for the
emetic type of gastrointestinal disease caused by Bacillus cereus. Recently, it has been shown that
this toxin is produced by a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), but its exact genetic
organization and biochemical synthesis is unknown.
Results: The complete sequence of the cereulide synthetase (ces) gene cluster, which encodes the
enzymatic machinery required for the biosynthesis of cereulide, was dissected. The 24 kb ces gene
cluster comprises 7 CDSs and includes, besides the typical NRPS genes like a phosphopantetheinyl
transferase and two CDSs encoding enzyme modules for the activation and incorporation of
monomers in the growing peptide chain, a CDS encoding a putative hydrolase in the upstream
region and an ABC transporter in the downstream part. The enzyme modules responsible for
incorporation of the hydroxyl acids showed an unusual structure while the modules responsible
for the activation of the amino acids Ala and Val showed the typical domain organization of NRPS.
The ces gene locus is flanked by genetic regions with high homology to virulence plasmids of B.
cereus, Bacillus thuringiensis and Bacillus anthracis. PFGE and Southern hybridization showed that the
ces genes are restricted to emetic B. cereus and indeed located on a 208 kb megaplasmid, which has
high similarities to pXO1-like plasmids.
Conclusion: The ces gene cluster that is located on a pXO1-like virulence plasmid represents,
beside the insecticidal and the anthrax toxins, a third type of B. cereus group toxins encoded on
megaplasmids. The ces genes are restricted to emetic toxin producers, but pXO1-like plasmids are
also present in emetic-like strains. These data might indicate the presence of an ancient plasmid in
B. cereus which has acquired different virulence genes over time. Due to the unusual structure of
the hydroxyl acid incorporating enzyme modules of Ces, substantial biochemical efforts will be
required to dissect the complete biochemical pathway of cereulide synthesis.

Background
Bacillus cereus belongs to the B. cereus group of organisms
that comprises the genetically highly related organisms
Bacillus anthracis, B. cereus, Bacillus mycoides, Bacillus pseudomycoides, Bacillus thuringiensis, and Bacillus weihenstephanensis, (16, 33)which for the most part are capable
of producing significantly different toxins. B. anthracis
causes the fatal animal and human disease anthrax,
whereas B. thuringiensis produces insecticidal toxins that
are commercially used as biocontrol agents [1-3]. Toxin
producing B. cereus plays an important role as the causative agent of two types of food poisoning: diarrhea and
emesis (for review see Granum [4] and Ehling-Schulz et
al., [5]). The emetic syndrome caused by B. cereus is
mainly characterized by vomiting a few hours after ingestion of the contaminated food while diarrhoeal poisoning
is caused by heat-labile enterotoxins produced during vegetative growth of B. cereus in the small intestine [6]. The
latter, diarrhea eliciting, toxins are well characterized at
the molecular and the transcriptional level [7-10]. Far less
is known about the emesis causing toxin cereulide, which
has twice been reported to have been involved in the
death of a child due to liver failure [11,12].
Cereulide is a small, heat and acid stable cyclic dodecadepsipeptide which is chemically closely related to the
potassium ionophore valinomycin [13]. It is toxic to
mitochondria by acting as a potassium ionophore (2,
25)and has been reported to inhibit human natural killer
cells [14]. According to its chemical structure one could
expect cereulide to be synthesized enzymatically via nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs).
NRPSs are large multifunctional proteins that have a modular organization. The modules, which show a conserved
domain structure, selectively catalyze activation and
thioester formation of one amino, α-hydroxy or carboxylic acid monomer [15,16]. A minimal module comprises
an adenylation (A domain) that activates the cognate substrate and a thiolation domain (T domain) that binds the
activated substrate. Chain elongation of the peptide is catalyzed by condensation domains (C domains), located at
N-terminal ends of modules which accept acyl groups
from the preceding modules [17]. A C-terminal thioesterase domain (TE domain) catalyzes the release of the
mature NRPS-bound peptide product [18]. Some modules contain additional domains, like epimerization and
methylation domains, that modify the incorporated constituents (for review see Sieber and Marahiel [19]). The
order of modules usually corresponds directly to the order
of monomers in the peptide product [20,21]. Quite
recently, we identified a putative valine activating module
that was highly conserved among emetic B. cereus. Disruption of the corresponding gene by insertion mutagenesis
revealed cereulide deficient mutants, providing for the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/6/20

first time unequivocal evidence for nonribosomal assembly of the emetic toxin cereulide [22].
The main virulence factors of B. anthracis and insecticidal
toxin genes of B. thuringiensis are located on large, well
characterized virulence plasmids while diarrhea eliciting
enterotoxins of B. cereus are located chromosomally.
However, the exact genomic location and organization of
the cereulide synthetase genes, which represent the main
virulence factors of the emetic type of B. cereus, was hitherto unknown. The aim of this work was to completely
sequence and characterize the genetic locus responsible
for cereulide synthesis including the flanking genomic
regions in order to gain insight into the synthesis mechanism of this peptide toxin, to determine the genomic location of the ces gene cluster and to study its conservation
among B. cereus group members.

Results
Organization of the cereulide synthetase (ces) gene cluster
The total sequence of the cereulide synthetase gene cluster
(24 kb) was dissected by module jumping and inverse
PCR. Sequence analysis showed that the ces gene cluster
encodes 7 CDSs: cesH, cesP, cesT, cesA, cesB, cesC and cesD
(Fig. 1). CesH is located at the 5' end of the cluster 990 bp
upstream of cesP in the same reading frame. cesT is located
268 bp downstream from cesP while cesA overlaps with
cesT. cesB is separated by 13 bp from the stop codon of
cesA. cesC and cesD are located in the 3' part of the ces gene
cluster (Fig. 1). No termination structures were predicted,
neither between the CDSs cesPTABCD nor between cesH
and cesP, but downstream of the cesD gene a hairpin structure was predicted using Mfold [23], indicative of the presence of a terminator sequence. The deduced protein
sequence (Table 2) from cesH (31 kDa) showed significant (58%) identity to putative hydrolases/acyltransferases (COG0596) from B. cereus group members. The
following CDS, designated cesP (28.9 kDa), showed high
homology (32–38% identity and approx. 60% similarity)
to the 4'-phosphopantetheinyl transferase from Bacillus
brevis and Bacillus subtilis involved in nonribosomal synthesis of gramicidin S (Gsp; Swissprot database accession
no. P40683) and to surfactin (Sfp; Swissprot database
accession no. P39135), respectively [24,25]. cesT starts
with a GTG and is preceded by a putative RBS (AGGAG) 5
bp upstream of the start codon. CesT (27.6 kDa) showed
significant similarity to BacT from Bacillus licheniformis
(GenBank accession no. AF007865.2; 33% identity and
56% similarity), GrsT from B. brevis (GenBank accession
no. AJ566197; 35% identity, 53% similarity) and other
thioesterases associated with NRPS. The structural genes
of cereulide synthetase are coded by the two large CDSs
(10 kb and 8 kb) cesA and cesB. CesA and CesB, each of
which is responsible for the activation and incorporation
of two monomers in the peptide chain, show high homol-

control sequence reaction are not shown

ogy to known NRPS and PKS-NRPS hybrids. Alignment of
CesA and CesB revealed 32% identity and 53% similarity
between these two proteins. cesC and cesD, located in the
3' part of the ces gene cluster, encode a putative ABC transporter. ABC binding cassettes and transmembrane
domains, typical for the ABC transporter family, were
identified in these sequences.
Analysis of the NRPS domains of cereulide synthetases
The CesA synthetase harbors two modules with the
domain structure Ai-x-Aii-T-C-A-T-E-C and the CesB synthetase shows the domain structure Ai-x-Aii-T-C-A-T-TE
(Fig. 1). Ai comprises the conserved core motifs A1–A8
while Aii contains the core motifs A9 and A10, and x refers
to a region of unknown function. Generally, the order of
modules in a given NRPS correlates to the order of monomers in the peptide product, hence CesA is expected to
activate the precursors for D-O-Leu (CesA1) and D-Ala
(CesA2), while CesB is expected to be involved in the acti-

vation of a precursor of L-O-Val (CesB1) and the activation and incorporation of the proteinogenic amino acid LVal (CesB2). Using the amino acid specificity code [26],
the substrate activated by the modules CesA2 and CesB2
could be clearly predicted to be Ala and Val, while no A
domain specificities could be predicted for the modules
CesA1 and CesB1 (data not shown). However, alignment
and genetic analysis of A domains revealed significant
similarities between the latter modules, which are
involved in the incorporation of the non-proteinogenic
oxy acids (Fig. 2). A comparison of the A domain core
motifs showed that these are less conserved in CesA1 and
CesB1 than in CesA2 and CesB2 (Fig. 3A). In addition, the
A domains of CesA1 and CesB1 are interrupted by an
insertion (x) of about 550 amino acids between the A8
and A9 core motifs. The inserted sequences from CesA1
and CesB1 showed 25% identity and 40% similarity.
Comparison to database sequences revealed no significant homology of the first 320 aa of these sequences,

to pBtoxis could be observed. The sequence of the DNA
region upstream from ces is 94% identical to the corresponding sequence of pBc10987 and 88% identical to
pBtoxis,
respectively.

For details on CDS designation see Table 2. The bars refer to
probes used to test the conservation of ces genes in the B.
cereus group (see Table 3) Inset: Structure of cereulide
according to [13].

PFGE and hybridization studies
Undigested genomic DNA from selected emetic and
emetic-like B. cereus strains was separated by PFGE, blotted on a membrane and hybridized to probes that were
directed either against the cereulide synthetase genes (cesB
probe obtained from emetic B. cereus) or against a CDS
located in the flanking region of the ces genes (pXO1-11
probe obtained from B. anthracis). The hybridization
results (see Fig. 4) showed that the cereulide synthetase is

while the C-terminal part of the insertions showed significant similarities to enzymes belonging to the short chain
dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily (Fig. 3B).
The module CesA2 contains an epimerase (E) domain,
which is consistent with the D-stereochemistry of the Ala
residue of cereulide. In the C-terminal region of CesB a
putative thioesterase (TE) domain comprising 254 amino
acid residues (29 kDa) was identified (Table 2).
Sequence and analysis of flanking regions of the ces
operon
The flanking regions of the ces operon were sequenced by
inverse PCR and the resulting sequences were searched
against NCBI's non-redundant database using BLAST
algorithms. The 5' region and the 3' region of the ces genes
showed significant homology (about 90% identity) to B.
anthracis toxin-encoding pXO1 plasmid sequences and to
pBc10987 [27]. To gain additional sequence information
primers were designed using B. anthracis plasmid pXO1
sequence information. A total of 3.5 kb upstream and 9.5
kb downstream of the ces operon was sequenced. The corresponding upstream CDSs showed high identities (60%
to 98%) to hypothetical proteins located on virulence
plasmids of B. anthracis, B. thuringiensis, and B. cereus
(pXO1 (GenBank Acc. no. AE017336), pBtoxis (GenBank

revealed 7 hypothetical proteins with homologies of more
than 90% to hypothetical proteins from pXO1, pBCXO1
and pBc10987. The region downstream of the ces genes is
nearly identical to the corresponding sequence of

located on a megaplasmid, designated pBCE4810, of the
same size as pBc10987 (208 kb). No hybridization signals
were obtained from the non-emetic strains tested. Emeticlike strains reacted positively with the pXO1-11 derived
probe but not with the ces probe. However, the sizes of the
plasmids reacting with pXO1-11 differed slightly from
that of the emetic strains (Fig. 4). Additional probes targeting different modules of the cereulide synthetase
operon and its flanking regions were designed, and slot
blot analysis was carried out to determine if parts of the ces
gene locus are conserved in non-emetic B. cereus group
strains. None of the non-emetic strains reacted with any of
the ces genes derived probes (Table 3), while some of the
strains, especially emetic-like strains, were positive in
hybridization assays with pXO1 derived probes (Table 4).
The corresponding plasmid from one of these emetic-like

strains, pBCEL1519 from B. cereus NVH 1519-00, was partially sequenced using primers designed from pBCE4810
sequence with similarity to pXO1.

Discussion
The cereulide synthetase operon
We have sequenced a 36 kb genetic region in the B. cereus
emetic reference strain F4810/72 involved in the biosynthesis of cereulide. Previous knock out mutants have
shown that this toxin is produced by a multi-enzyme complex named cereulide synthetase [22]. The chemical structure of cereulide is reflected in the genetic organization of
its synthetase genes (Fig. 1). This gene cluster comprises,
besides the typical genes such as a 4'-phosphopantetheinyl transferase (cesP) essential for activating the NRPS
(apoenzyme to holoenzyme) and the structural genes
responsible for the assembly of the peptide product, a
putative type II thioesterase (cesT) which could potentially
remove misprimed monomers and regenerate the NRPS
[28]. A putative hydrolase (cesH) is located in the 5' part
of the cereulide biosynthesis cluster and a putative ABC
transporter (cesC/D) is encoded in its 3' part. CesC/D
might either be involved in the transport of cereulide or
confer self resistance towards cereulide.

The structure of the ces genes and number of modules predicts a monomeric tetrapeptide but cereulide is a trimeric
depsipeptide (Fig. 1). A similar structure has been
described for gramicidin S and enterobactin. Synthesis of
those peptides is carried out by one NRPS that is regenerated and repetitively used for synthesis. In case of such
iterative processes the TE domains have additional functions allowing the collinear synthesis to be repeated two
or three times (for review see [19]). The exact mechanism
of these iterative TEs is not yet known, but mutation studies provided evidence that the TE domain of E. coli EntF
catalyzes cyclolactonization as well as chain elongation
[29]. A similar mechanism resulting in intramolecular
trimerization might also be involved in cereulide assembly.
Unusual structure of heterocompound activating modules
The A domains of the heterocompound activating modules CesA1 and CesB1 are less conserved than the A
domains from CesA2 and CesB2, which activate the
amino acid moieties (Fig. 2). Especially, the core motifs
A4 and A5 differ significantly from the typical consensus
motifs described by Marahiel et al., [20]. Nevertheless,
they show some homology to the corresponding motifs of
phenylacetate activating modules MycG-A and NdaC and
to aryl acid activating modules DhbE and EntE [30,31]
(see Fig. 3A). The crystal structures of the phenylalanineactivating A domain of gramicidin S synthetase and the
structure of DhbE involved in bacillibactin synthesis
revealed a decisive role of the core motifs A4 and A5 in

from B. cereus ATCC 10987 (lane 2).

substrate binding and selection [31,32]. The altered A4
and A5 core motifs found in CesA1 and CesB1 did not
allow substrate prediction for these modules. The A4
motif usually represents the first anchor in amino acid
activating domains, however this core motif is missing in
DhbE as its substrate does not contain any α-aminogroup. In DhbE the A4 motif, as well as the A5, is replaced
by another sequence motif that is thought to be specific
for carboxy acid activating enzymes [31] while the residue
K517 is conserved in α-amino acid activating domains, in
the carboy activating domain of DhbE, as well as in CesA1
and CesB1 (data not shown). Since the A4 and A5 motifs
of the two hydroxy acid incorporating modules of the
cereulide synthetase are quite similar, it is tempting to
speculate that the motifs are characteristic for a special
type of substrate (see Fig. 3A). Detailed biochemical and
structural analysis will be necessary to clarify the substrate
specificity of these modified A domains. Nevertheless, the
altered motifs found in CesA1, CesB1 and other NRPSs
might be useful to identify yet unknown A domains activating new types of substrates.
In addition, about 550 amino acids are inserted between
the core motifs A8 and A9 in CesA1 and CesB1 (Fig. 1).
Different types of insertions in A domains located at this
position have been described for bacterial NRPS such as
methyltransferases and oxidoreductases [33,34]. Since the

The megaplasmid encoded cereulide synthetase genes are
restricted to emetic strains
In order to investigate the distribution and conservation
of the ces genes among B. cereus group members, Southern
blot analysis was performed using different probes that
target all CDSs belonging to the ces operon and hypothetical CDSs located in the periphery of these genes. Special
emphasis was placed on emetic-like strains since these are
closely related to emetic strains but do not produce
cereulide [36]. Our results revealed a strict confinement of
ces genes to cereulide producers (Table 3). The putative
hydrolase encoded by cesH was not detected in the nonemetic B. cereus group strains and is therefore considered

did not reveal any significant homologies to characterized
proteins from database entries, no decisive function could
be attributed to these domains in the cereulide synthetase.
However, the C terminal part of both insertions showed
homologies to short chain dehydrogenases (SDR) and
ketoreductases (KR) (Fig. 3B). In addition to the Rossmann fold motif, SDR catalytic Tyr and Ser residues,
which are also highly conserved in reductase domains
from polyketide synthetases (KR domains) [35], were
identified (Fig 3B). As in KR domains the catalytic Lys residue of SDRs is substituted by an Asn in CesA1 and CesB1.
It is therefore tempting to speculate that the inserted
domains x (KR) might indeed catalyze the ketoreduction
of the substrates bound to CesA1 and CesB1, respectively.

an integral part of the ces gene locus. However, several
non-emetic strains, especially emetic-like strains, were
positive in hybridization studies using probes derived
from ces flanking pXO1 homolog CDSs (Table 4). A high
conservation of pXO1 genes among B. cereus group members and other closely related bacilli has previously been
reported [37], but no information on emetic or emeticlike strains was provided in this study. Recently it has been
reported that cereulide production depends on the presence of a plasmid. Cured emetic strains lost their ability to
produce cereulide [38]. Our hybridization experiments
(Fig. 4) showed that the cereulide synthetase encoding
plasmid pBCE4810 is of the same size as the sequenced
pXO1 related plasmid pBc10987 (208 kb) from B. cereus
ATCC 10987 [27]. The latter, however, does not carry the
ces genes. Plasmid sizes from emetic-like strains were
slightly variable, but partial sequences of the plasmid
pBCEL1519 (7.4 kb) from the emetic-like strain
NVH1590-00 revealed an identity of nearly 100% to
pBc10987 and 90% to pXO1. A comparison of virulence
plasmids from B. cereus group members and the partially
sequenced plasmids pBCE4810 from the emetic B. cereus
reference strain F4810/72, and pBCEL1519 from the
emetic-like strain NVH1519-00, showed that the ces gene
locus is inserted in a highly conserved part of these virulence plasmids between genes with similarities to pXO114 and pXO1-11 (Fig. 5). However, the inserts differ: at
this location on pXO1 and pBCXO1 are the genes for

pXO1-13, a hypothetical virulence factor, and pXO1-12,
whereas pBCE4810 contains the ces locus responsible for
cereulide synthesis, and pBc10987 and pBCEL1519 both
possess an identical 2 kb insert of unknown function.
Downstream of this genetic locus a group II intron has
recently been described in pBc10987 [39] that is also
present in pBCE4810 and pBCEL1519 (Fig. 5). At the corresponding genetic region in pXO1 a group I intron has
been identified [39]. Group I and group II introns were
also found in other sequenced B. cereus group strains.
Quite recently, evidence was provided that the group II
introns splice in vivo [39]. This ability to splice is a prerequisite for mobility and insertion into new DNA target
sites, and could become beneficial for the organism under
stressful conditions.
Evolution of different toxin plasmids from an ancient
virulence plasmid in a B. cereus ancestor?
The key role of the toxin plasmid pXO1 in anthrax pathogenesis and the importance of toxin harboring plasmids
for insecticidal pathogenesis of B. thuringiensis are well
known, whereas knowledge about the function of B.
cereus plasmids is quite limited (for review see Rasko et al.,
[40]). Our present work revealed a third type of B. cereus
group toxins being encoded by a megaplasmid: the biosynthetical genes responsible for the emetic type of B.
cereus food borne disease are also located on a pXO1-like
plasmid (Fig. 4). Thus, all species specific toxins of the B.

cereus group are located on megaplasmids while the enterotoxins, which are broadly distributed among B. cereus
group members [41], are localized on the chromosome.
BLAST searches using the partial pBCE4810 sequence
revealed high similarities (85–99%) of the ces gene flanking regions to pXO1 and the B. cereus plasmids pBc10987
and the pXO1-like plasmid pBCXO1, and high similarities (87–93%) in the 5' region of ces to the insecticidal
toxin plasmid pBtoxis and a plasmid designated pE33L9
from a B. cereus strain isolated from a dead zebra. Comparison of selected pXO1-like CDSs from F4810/72
revealed an overall identity of about 95% of BCE4810 to
pBc10987, about 92% identity to pBCXO1, and about
90% identity to pXO1. Like pBc10987, emetic strains
seem to lack the B. anthracis PAI encoded virulence genes
since no hybridization signals were obtained with probes
targeting these genes (Table 4). The data presented in this
work will contribute to developing a better understanding
of the evolution and distribution of this group of plasmids. One might speculate that a plasmid in an ancestral
form has been present in B. cereus group strains, which
over time has acquired virulence genes conveying different disease causing phenotypes. Nevertheless, a detailed
phylogenetic analysis of plasmids-focusing on mobile elements- from all members of the B. cereus group will be
necessary to unravel the role of plasmids in pathogenesis
and evolution of the B. cereus group of organisms.

Conclusion
The characterization of the ces genes illustrated the high
flexibility of the module organization of bacterial NRPS.
A new type of insertion in A domains has been observed
in the modules CesA1 and CesB1. No clear function could
be assigned to the inserted domains, although hundreds
of NRPS modules have been sequenced and biochemically characterized. The characterization of the cereulide
synthetase genes and its flanking regions revealed the
extra-chromosomal location of the main virulence factor
of emetic B. cereus on a plasmid with a pXO1-like backbone. Sequencing of the entire plasmids from emetic and
emetic-like strains could provide new insight into the evolution of toxin producing members of the B. cereus group,
especially elucidation of the evolution of B. anthracis and
the emetic lineage of B. cereus.

Methods
Bacterial strains
The cereulide producing reference strain F4810/72 [42]
was used to determine the sequence of the complete
cereulide synthetase locus and the sequence of flanking
regions. Cells were grown on plate count (PC) agar plates
or in LB (Luria-Bertani) medium at 30°C. Escherichia coli
strains used for subcloning were grown at 37°C in LB
medium with the appropriate antibiotics. Details on the
origin of B. cereus group strains used to test the occurrence

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/6/20

of the ces genes in hybridization studies are provided in
Table S1 (see additional files).
Sequencing strategies
Due to stability problems with clones from a cosmid
library, the sequence of the total cereulide synthetase
operon and its flanking regions was determined by inverse
PCR and module jumping as described previously [22].
The latter sequencing strategy took advantage of highly
conserved core motifs in NRPS genes which have been
successfully used to design degenerated primers and
amplify novel NRPS modules [20,43]. With the combination of a specific primer located in the known sequence
and a degenerated primer located in a core motif in a putative flanking module, additional sequence information
can be gained by "jumping" from one module to the next
one, see e.g. [22]. Organization of the ces gene cluster was
confirmed by direct sequencing of the antisense strand
from genomic DNA. In addition, primers derived from
genomic sequences of the B. anthracis pXO1 toxin plasmid
and the B. cereus ATCC 10987 pBc10987 plasmid were
used to obtain sequence information from flanking
regions of the cereulide synthetase operon. DNA was prepared using the AquaPure Genomic DNA Isolation-Kit
(Bio-Rad, Germany). For inverse PCR total chromosomal
DNA was isolated by phenol-chloroform extraction as
described previously [43]. Preparation of plasmid DNA
was performed according to standard procedures [44].
Sequences of degenerated primers successfully used for
module jumping are listed in Table 1. Amplicons from
module jumping were subcloned in TOPO TA vectors
according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Invitrogen, USA) and sequenced as described previously [22].
PCR amplification products obtained with primers predicted from plasmids of B. cereus group members and PCR
products obtained by inverse PCR were either subcloned
in TOPO TA or directly sequenced by using a BigDye Terminator v1.1 Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems).
Sequence analysis
The sequencing analysis software package Vector NTI
(Informax Inc., U.S.A.) was used to generate the contig
sequence from the sequenced PCR products obtained by
PCR, inverse PCR and module jumping and the resulting
sequence was searched against the sequenced genomes of
B. cereus group members. Sequence similarity searches
were performed using the Basic Local Aligment Search
Tools BLASTX and BLASTP on the NCBI website [45,46].
The software packages ClustalX and TREECON were used
for sequence alignments and cluster analysis [47,48]. Substrate specificity of ces genes was assessed according to
Stachelhaus et al; [26]. The terminator search tool [49]
available at Heidelberg Unix Sequence Analysis Resources
[50] and Mfold [51], available at the Macfarlane Burnet

Center's internet site [51], were used for the prediction of
termination sequences.
Hybridization assays
For hybridization studies chromosomal DNA was isolated
with the Puregene DNA isolation kit (Gentra, USA)
according to the manufacturer's instruction and blotted
onto nitrocellulose using a Milliblot-S slot blot manifold
(Millipore, USA). Hybridization was performed using digoxigenin-labelled probes (Roche) directed against the different modules of ces, genes flanking the ces locus and
selected pXO1 CDSs. The probes were obtained from the
emetic reference strain F4810/72 and B. anthracis CIPA2
(provided by Gilles Vernaud, Orsay, France) and B.
anthracis 6–87 (provided by Ulrich Busch, Oberschleissheim, Germany) by PCR using the oligonucleotide
primers described in Table S2 (see additional files). Optimal hybridization temperature for each probe was calculated and hybridization was carried out according to
recommendations of the manufacturer (Roche, Germany). After hybridization, membranes were washed
twice for 15 min in 2 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS at room
temperature and two times 15 min in 0.1 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 65°C. Detection was performed by
enzyme immunoassay according to recommendation of
manufacture (Roche, Germany) with the chemiluminescence CDP-Star AP substrate (Novagen, USA).
Pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)
Preparation of total genomic DNA in agarose plugs was
performed as described by Kolsto et al., [52]. Electrophoresis was performed using a CHEF DR III System (BioRad) with a 0.8% SeaKem Gold Agarose gel (Cambrex Bio
Science, USA) in 0.25 × TBE buffer (25 mM Tris-borate
buffer pH 8, 0.05 mM EDTA) at 15°C with a pulse of 5–
200 s for 20 hours. Size of the fragments was estimated
using lambda concatamers (Bio-Rad) and Salmonella
Braenderup Global Standard (PulseNet) H9812 (XbaI
digested). After electrophoresis, gels were stained in 100
µg/ml ethidium bromide for 30 min and destained in
water for 1 h. Gels were denaturated in 0.25 M HCl for 15
min, followed by soaking the gel in 1.5 M NaCl/0.5 N
NaOH with constant agitation for 2 × 30 min. Neutralization was performed in 0.5 M Tris (pH 8)/1.5 M NaCl for
2 × 30 min. Gels were blotted overnight by capillary transfer in 20 × SSC onto Hybond-N+ nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences, UK). After blotting, the
membranes were rinsed in 6 × SSC, air dried for 30 min at
room temperature and finally baked for 2 h at 80°C.
Hybridization was performed as described above.
