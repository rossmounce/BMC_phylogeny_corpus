Characterization of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.)
NAC transcription factors suggests conserved
functions compared to both monocots and dicots
Michael W Christiansen, Preben B Holm and Per L Gregersen*

Abstract
Background: The NAC transcription factor family is involved in the regulation of traits in both monocots and
dicots of high agronomic importance. Understanding the precise functions of the NAC genes can be of utmost
importance for the improvement of cereal crop plants through plant breeding. For the cereal crop plant barley
(Hordeum vulgare L.) only a few NAC genes have so far been investigated.
Results: Through searches in publicly available barley sequence databases we have obtained a list of 48 barley
NAC genes (HvNACs) with 43 of them representing full-length coding sequences. Phylogenetic comparisons to
Brachypodium, rice, and Arabidopsis NAC proteins indicate that the barley NAC family includes members from all
of the eight NAC subfamilies, although by comparison to these species a number of HvNACs still remains to be
identified. Using qRT-PCR we investigated the expression profiles of 46 HvNACs across eight barley tissues (young
flag leaf, senescing flag leaf, young ear, old ear, milk grain, late dough grain, roots, and developing stem) and two
hormone treatments (abscisic acid and methyl jasmonate).
Conclusions: Comparisons of expression profiles of selected barley NAC genes with the published functions of
closely related NAC genes from other plant species, including both monocots and dicots, suggest conserved
functions in the areas of secondary cell wall biosynthesis, leaf senescence, root development, seed development,
and hormone regulated stress responses.

Background
In recent years, research in the regulatory roles of members of the plant-specific NAC (NAM, ATAF-1,2, CUC)
transcription factor family has increased considerably. It
has become evident that these transcription factors are
essential components in the regulation of a multitude of
traits in plants, including traits of agronomic importance
such as development, senescence, tolerance to both biotic and abiotic stresses, and hormone responses.
The first NAC transcription factor was described fifteen years ago by Souer et al. [1]. Since then the genomes of a number of plant species have been fully
sequenced, revealing the NAC gene family to code for
one of the largest families of transcription factors in
plants [2]. Members of the family are identified by the
presence of the NAC domain [3]. This domain consists

Centre Flakkebjerg, 4200 Slagelse, Denmark

of five subdomains: A-E [4,5] that make up motifs for
both DNA-binding and protein-protein interactions [6].
A typical NAC transcription factor has the conserved
NAC domain in the N-terminal [5] as well as a more
variable, transcriptional activation or repression region
in the C-terminal [7] (figure 1A). Thirteen Arabidopsis
and six rice NAC transcription factors have been shown
to contain an a-helical transmembrane motif in the far
C-terminal region which anchors the NAC protein to
intracellular membranes rendering them inert. Only
through controlled proteolytic cleavage from this anchor
are the proteins able to exert their function [8]. Examination of known NAC families reveals a few atypical
NAC genes, such as genes encoding only the NAC
domain or genes with the NAC domain in the C-terminal with the variable region preceding it (figure 1B).
None of these atypical NAC genes have been among
closely characterized NAC genes, and therefore their
functions are still unknown.

Figure 1 Structure of the NAC transcription factor. A: Typical
NAC transcription factor, with N-terminal NAC domain, consisting of
five conserved subdomains, A-E. The C-terminal part of the protein
is more variable and contains the transcriptional activation or
repressing region. B: Several variations on the typical NAC
transcription factors can be found. A number of characterized NAC
proteins have a conserved transmembrane motive, TM, in the far Cterminal region. Other variations include proteins with NAC domain
only or proteins with the NAC domain in the C-terminal.

There have been several attempts to classify the phylogenetic relationships among all members of the NAC
family [2,5,9,10]. However, the most comprehensive
classification to date is the one published by Shen et al.
[2], who divided the NAC superfamily into eight distinct
NAC-subfamilies, NAC-a to NAC-h, based on NAC
domain alignments. Furthermore, each subfamily was
divided into several subgroups based on C-terminal
motifs.
Since the first NAC gene was described, a number of
NAC transcription factors have been characterized, in
particular from the Arabidopsis NAC family (ANACs,
115 members) and, to a lesser extent, from the rice
NAC family (ONACs, 144 members). There have been
only a few detailed studies on NAC genes from species
with non-sequenced genomes, such as wheat and barley
[11,12].
So far it is known that many aspects of secondary
cell wall biosynthesis (SCWB) are regulated by NAC
transcription factors. Arabidopsis NST1 (ANAC043)
was found to promote secondary cell wall thickening
in the stem fibers [13-15]. NST2 (ANAC066), a close
homologue of NST1, seems to have some functional
redundancy to NST1. However, it shows strong promoter activity in the anthers, suggesting this tissue to
be the primary site of NST2 regulation [15]. A homologue of NST1 in Medicago truncatula (MtNST1) was
recently found to regulate lignin biosynthesis in the
interfascicular region of the cell wall [16]. SND1
(NST3/ANAC012) appears to specifically regulate
xylary fiber thickness [13,14,17,18]. This regulation
most likely involves SND2 and SND3 (ANAC073 and
ANAC010, respectively), which are both downstream
targets of SND1 [19]. In Populus an orthologue of

SND2 and SND3, PopNAC154, was shown to affect
stem elongation [20].
Several NACs have been shown to regulate leaf senescence. Guo and Gan [21] described how AtNAP
(ANAC029) could induce or delay leaf senescence in
overexpression or knockout plants, respectively. More
recently, the two paralogues ORE1 (AtNAC2/
ANAC092) [22,23] and ORS1 (ANAC059) [24] were
found to regulate salt-induced senescence. Positional
cloning of a quantitative trait locus associated with
increased grain protein content in wheat lead to the discovery of the wheat NAC transcription factor NAM-B1
[11]. As a possible orthologue of AtNAP NAM-B1 was
also able to induce leaf senescence as well as increase
grain protein content [25]. Besides its role in leaf senescence, ORE1 also plays a part in lateral root development as this formation is promoted in transgenic plants
overexpressing ORE1 [26]. Another NAC transcription
factor, NAC1 (ANAC021), has similarly been shown to
induce the formation of lateral roots [27].
So far a number of NAC transcription factors have
been shown to be involved in biotic and abiotic stress
responses. In particular, tolerance to drought stress has
been the center of many studies. Abscisic acid (ABA)
accumulation seems to be a major trigger of plant
genetic drought responses [28], which is also reflected
by the fact that all the NAC transcription factors
reported to confer drought tolerance are inducible by
ABA treatment. In rice, this applies for SNAC1
(ONAC002) [29], ONAC045 [30], OsNAC6 (SNAC2/
ONAC048) [31], OsNAC52 (ONAC088) [32], and
OsNAC10 (ONAC120) [33], and in Arabidopsis it
applies to ATAF-1 (ANAC002) [34], ANAC019 [35],
ANAC055 [35], NTL6 (ANAC062) [8], and RD26
(ANAC072) [35,36].
Jasmonic acid (JA) is another phytohormone known to
be involved in various stress responses, particularly in
response to pathogen attacks [37]. This is also reflected
in the number of reported NACs that have a role in
pathogen defense and are induced by JA: GRAB2 [38],
RIM1 (ONAC054) [39], ANAC019 [40], ANAC055 [40],
and ATAF-2 (ANAC081) [41].
Untill now, only five barley NAC genes have been
mentioned in the literature. The first study was done in
2003 by Scharrenberg et al. [42] who isolated cDNA
clones from senescing barley flag leaves. One of these
clones, named HvSF6, showed homology to wheat NAC
transcription factor GRAB2 earlier reported to be
involved in wheat Geminivirus defense [38]. The expression of this NAC gene was found to be induced by both
age-dependent and dark-induced senescence, as well as
a combination of the hormones ethylene and JA. Interestingly, neither hormone alone was enough to cause
the induction of this gene.

Robertson [43] identified, through yeast one-hybrid
screens, a barley NAC transcription factor, HSINAC,
interacting with HvSPY. HvSPY is a negative regulator
of gibberellin signaling. This NAC gene was found to be
highly expressed in shoot, mature blade, sheath, and
mature aleurone, and lowly expressed in young blade
and stem, and was barely detectable in coleoptile and
root. Jensen et al. [44] published their results on the
barley HvNAC6 transcription factor, a homologue of
Arabidopsis ATAF-1. They presented evidence of a role
for HvNAC6 in penetration resistance to powdery mildew fungus. Besides being up-regulated during powdery
mildew infection, no other expression data was
presented.
Ogo et al. [45] published a comprehensive study on a
rice NAC transcription factor called IDEF2. IDEF2 was
suggested to be involved in iron homeostasis and was
identified by its specific binding to promoter DNA containing an iron deficiency response element (IDE). A
barley IDE was used in the same way to identify a barley
homologue of IDEF2 called HvIDEF2. It was isolated
from a root cDNA library, but otherwise no expression
data was presented.
Finally, there have been two publications on the barley
HvNAM-1 [12,46] encoding a homologue of the wheat
TtNAM-B1 NAC transcription factor shown to regulate
both senescence and grain protein content (GPC) [11].
Gene polymorphisms of HvNAM-1 in three Hordeum
species explained some of the variation in GPC [12] suggesting that the biological function of HvNAM-1 is
similar to that of TtNAM-B1.
Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is an important food and
feed crop worldwide. Besides its agronomic importance,
barley has also been used as the model species of choice
for many researchers in the field of small grain cereal
crops. Although its genome has not yet been fully
sequenced, an extensive EST (expressed sequence tags)
collection is available containing samples from a wide
variety of tissues, different developmental stages, and
pathogen infections, as well as an increasing amount of
microarray data from the Affymetrix Barley1 GeneChip
(http://www.plexdb.org/plex.php?database=Barley). Considering that many of the NAC transcription factors in
barley will most likely turn out to be key regulators of
important agronomic traits, as they are in other species,
studies of this gene family are pertinent.
This work presents the first phylogenetic classification
of H. vulgare NAC genes (HvNACs). 48 individual
HvNACs were identified with 43 of them representing
full-length coding sequences. Specific, quantitative realtime PCR (qRT-PCR) primers could be designed for 46
HvNAC genes, and the expression profiles of these were
investigated in eight tissues of the barley plant as well as
after two different hormone treatments of leaves with

Page 3 of 13

ABA and methyl jasmonate (MeJA). In conclusion, the
results provide good evidence that also in barley the
NAC gene family is involved in regulatory pathways of
importance for agronomic traits.

Results
HvNAC genes

Searching all presently available barley nucleotide
sequences for features of the characteristic NAC
domains resulted in a list of 48 barley NAC genes either
based on full-length cDNA, genomic sequences, or EST
contigs. Nine of the genes were represented by only partial coding sequences based on homologous proteins in
Brachypodium and rice. In order to obtain more fulllength coding sequences (CDS), partial length EST
clones were resequenced or cloned and sequenced when
possible. This procedure reduced the number of partial
length genes from 9 to 5. The complete list of established barley NAC genes is shown in table 1. The barley
NAC genes were named according to the recommendations by Gray et al. [47]. The numbering of the genes
was arbitrary except for a few sequences, e.g.
HvNAC001 and HvNAC006, where annotation had
already been made for submitted sequences. Sequence
alignments of the HvNACs and all NAC proteins
known to contain a C-terminal transmembrane anchor
revealed four barley NACs with this motif: HvNAC002,
HvNAC007, HvNAC016 and HvNAC048.
Phylogenetics

The HvNACs were classified according to the system
proposed by Shen et al. [2] based on positions in a phylogenetic tree made from the alignment of the conserved NAC domains of ONACs, ANACs, and HvNACs
(additional file 1). The phylogenetic tree also includes
Brachypodium distachyon NACs (BdNACs) as well a
few selected NACs from other species discussed in this
paper. Table 2 shows the distribution of HvNACs
among the eight NAC subfamilies. In addition to the
NAC subfamily classification, Shen et al. [2] further
divided the NAC transcription factors into subgroups
based on homology of C-terminal regions. By referring
to the subgrouping of the ANACs and ONACs, each of
the full-length HvNACs could in most cases be assigned
to a NAC subgroup as well. These subgroups are listed
in table 1. This table also lists putative orthologues of
each HvNAC among BdNACs, ONACs, and ANACs.
Through full-length protein alignments, the possible
orthologues were identified as having a highly conserved
NAC domain as well as one or more conserved C-terminal motifs. Figure 2 illustrates the identification of Cterminal motifs for putative orthologues exemplified by
HvNAC033 and HvNAC011. In both cases at least three
conserved, smaller motifs can be observed. After

List of barley HvNACs with EMBL/GenBank accession numbers. The length of each established gene transcript is given as either full or partial coding sequence as
compared to wheat or Brachypodium homologues. Phylogenetic grouping was performed according to Shen et al. [2] and was based only on the NAC domain of
the encoded protein. For HvNACs with no close rice or Arabidopsis homologues, only the subfamily is noted. The putative orthologues are based on full-length
protein alignments and the presence of conserved motifs in the C-terminal. No orthologues are listed for the partial length proteins. The percent identity, on fulllength amino acid level, between the barley NAC protein and the orthologue in question is given in parenthesis. Numbers in square brackets in the gene name
column represent references in the bibliographic reference list.

Distribution of NAC genes from barley, Brachypodium, rice, sorghum, and
Arabidopsis in the groups proposed by Shen et al. [2].

identifying each of the possible orthologues through
visual inspection of full-length protein alignments, their
percent identity was calculated as noted in table 1.
HvNAC gene expression studies

In order to extend our characterization of the HvNACs,
tissue-specific gene expression studies using qRT-PCR
were performed. One of the partial length sequences
HvNAC047 was excluded from this experiment, since
the design of a specific set of qRT-PCR primers was not
possible. HvNAC030 had aberrant expression, based on
the dissociation curves, in most of the tissues investigated, and so it was excluded after analysis of the qRTPCR data. The individual tissues were selected to cover
a range of plant organs. As several NAC genes from rice
and Arabidopsis have been shown to be hormone and
stress responsive, treatments with the two stress hormones ABA and MeJA were included in the expression
studies as well. The data collected from these experiments are presented in figure 3. The raw data from the
qRT-PCR experiment, as well as calculated p-values, can
be found in additional file 2. The relative expression
levels in each tissue were determined using the Limma
software with non-senescing flag leaf tissue as the reference. Prior to construction of the heatmap for the tissue
experiment in figure 3, the relative expression values for
each gene were re-scaled to have mean equal to zero in
order to bring the different expression patterns into the
same colour range centred on zero. We have included
in the figure one non-NAC gene Rubisco, encoding the
Rubisco small subunit, as a control that reflects the
amount of green photosynthesizing tissue. From figure 3
Rubisco is, as expected, found to be up-regulated in
young flag leaf, young ear and stem, and strongly downregulated in roots.
The eight tissues were selected in order to identify
HvNAC genes associated with processes already known
to be NAC regulated in other species. SCWB is represented here by the elongating stem tissue, and we see a

small group of just three genes (HvNAC033,
HvNAC034, and HvNAC039) clearly up-regulated. Leaf
senescence is represented by the senescing flag leaf,
where a number of genes are up-regulated. If we
observe the old ear and late dough grain as tissues,
where the senescence process is also taking place, as
well as ABA induction, since ABA is a known senescence inducer [48], three genes stand out as putative
senescence regulators: HvNAC005, HvNAC027, and
HvNAC029. A few NAC transcription factors regulate
root development, a process represented here by the
root tissue. Only three genes are highly up-regulated in
this tissue: HvNAC021, HvNAC022, and HvNAC032.
The old ear, milk grain, and late dough grain all represent various stages of seed development and as such
could help identify genes involved with regulation of
this. Looking at these tissues together, four genes stand
out quite clearly: HvNAC017, HvNAC018, HvNAC019,
and HvNAC024.
In the hormone treatment experiment, seven genes
were excluded from the heatmap due to expression data
of poor quality (aberrant dissociation curves at low
expression levels). The non-senescing flag leaf samples
showed low expression for all of the excluded genes,
and the poor quality might have been caused by an even
lower expression in the used plant material, which was
from young flag leaves harvested at an earlier developmental stage than the non-senescing flag leaves in order
to avoid environmental stresses. With the two hormone
treatments it is noticeable that only a few genes were
up- or down-regulated after three hours of treatment,
whereas more significant changes were observed after
five hours. There appears to be some phylogeny correlations in the genes induced by ABA. All members of the
NAC-a-6 subgroup, HvNAC005, HvNAC023, and
HvNAC027, are significantly up-regulated by ABA,
whereas both members of the closely related NAC-a-8
subgroup, HvNAC003 and HvNAC004, are down-regulated. All members of the NAC-d-7 subgroup,
HvNAC025 and HvNAC032, are up-regulated as well.
The remaining ABA-induced genes do not seem to be
systematically induced, in terms of phylogeny, which
seems also to be the case for all the MeJA-induced
genes. Of all the genes HvNAC027 stands out as being
highly responsive to both hormones.
Data from experiments using the Affymetrix 22 K Barley1 GeneChip provide a wealth of information on gene
expression in barley (http://www.plexdb.org/plex.php?
database=Barley). However, comparisons of our data to
Barley1 GeneChip data are complex, since, first, two
important tissues in our study the naturally senescing
flag leaf and the developing stem are not included in the
Barley1 GeneChip experiment on development stages in
barley [49], and, second, only 20 of the HvNAC genes

are represented by near full-length contigs of the Barley1 GeneChip. The remaining NAC genes are represented by contigs of variable lengths or are missing (19).
Hence, we decided to omit here systematic comparisons
of our data to Barley1 GeneChip data. However, several
HvNAC genes did in fact show good correspondence
among our results and Barley1 GeneChip data.

Examples from experiments BB3 and BB80 are: Up-regulation of HvNAC017, HvNAC18, and HvNAC024 in the
developing seed (Contig8993_at, Contig9284_at, and
Contig11340_at), up-regulation of HvNAC021 and
HvNAC022 in the root (Contig15867_at and Contig6484_at), up-regulation of HvNAC033 in young ear/
floral bracts (Contig19673_at), and up-regulation of

Figure 3 HvNAC gene expression patterns. Heatmaps showing the gene expression patterns across different tissues of the barley plant and
following 3 or 5 hours of treatment with the plant hormones abscisic acid (ABA) or methyl jasmonate (MeJA) for 46 HvNAC genes and Rubisco
(small subunit) as control gene. Relative gene expression levels at the log2 scale are indicated by a color scale, where red indicates high and
green low expression. The color bars in the lower corners show the range of gene expression differences in the two types of experiments. White
color in the hormone experiment indicates excluded HvNAC genes with expression data of poor quality (aberrant dissociation curves at low
expression levels). The gene expression levels were determined by quantitative real-time PCR as described in the material and methods section.
In brief, the presented expression data are based on three (tissues) or two (hormone treatments) biological replicates, each with three technical
replicate PCR runs, followed by normalization to the expression of the 18 S ribosomal RNA gene. Prior to construction of the heatmap for the
tissue experiment, the relative expression values for each gene were re-scaled to have mean equal to zero. Asterisks in the hormone
experiments indicate significant differences at the 0.05 level between treatment and control (p-values adjusted for multiple comparisons
according to default settings in the Limma software).

Discussion
HvNACs

In this study we have identified 48 HvNACs. However,
by observing the distribution of HvNACs across the
eight NAC subfamilies in table 2, it is evident that these

48 genes do not represent the entire barley NAC family.
Most likely, we have only identified about half of the
members of the complete barley NAC family. Taking
into account the distribution in table 2, the majority of
the missing barley NAC genes will most likely come
from subfamily H as well as E and G. As the available
barley EST databases are already quite extensive, it
seems unlikely that many of these missing HvNAC

Christiansen et al. BMC Research Notes 2011, 4:302
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/4/302

genes will be identified before the barley genome is fully
sequenced and made available. Again, as the barley EST
databases are extensive, it could be argued that the most
essential HvNACs with regard to plant development,
abiotic and biotic stress responses are probably among
the 48 genes identified in this study. However, a gene
with rare or very low expression does not equal a nonessential product, and thus important NAC genes could
still be absent from EST collections.
Phylogenetics

A number of different suggestions for the classification
of NAC transcription factors have been reported
[2,5,9,10]. The most comprehensive one by Shen et al.
[2] was adopted in this study on barley NAC genes.
For identification of putative Brachypodium, rice, and
Arabidopsis orthologues, full-length protein sequences
with closely related NAC domain regions were aligned
to reveal the C-terminal motifs. Generally, there is low
conservation in the C-terminal region of the NAC proteins, however, when aligning orthologues across species, the presence of small C-terminal motifs becomes
apparent. Table 1 shows putative orthologues, as well as
their percent identity of each HvNAC, based on both a
highly conserved N-terminal NAC domain and on conserved motifs in the C-terminal. Seven HvNAC genes
encode both a NAC domain and C-terminal motifs conserved throughout Brachypodium, rice, and Arabidopsis.
The orthologous NAC proteins among the grasses are
highly similar, often sharing with barley more than 70%
(for Brachypodium) or 60% (for rice) of their amino acid
sequence. It was not possible to identify clear Arabidopsis orthologues for many of the HvNACs. However,
there were a few which showed high conservation. In
these cases the percent identity was above 50%. It could
be speculated that NAC genes showing conservation
throughout the monocots and dicots could be involved
in important regulatory pathways. In support of this,
five out of the seven Arabidopsis NAC proteins identified as HvNAC orthologues have been characterized in
the literature and in all cases found to have profound
effects on the plants if overexpressed or knocked out
[13,41,50-52].
HvNAC expression

To validate our expression data, we included Rubisco as
an internal control, which showed an expression pattern
as expected, however, further validation can be done by
comparing our results with previous reports. HvSF6
(HvNAC008) was found to be up-regulated in senescing
tissue [42], matching entirely with our data. HvSF6 was
further seen to be induced by a combination of ethylene
and MeJA, but not MeJA alone [42], which also agrees
with the lack of induction by our MeJA treatment.

Page 8 of 13

HSINAC (HvNAC031) was found to be up-regulated in
mature blade and mature aleurone [43], fitting well with
the up-regulation we observed in the senescing leaf and
late dough grain, respectively. Furthermore, a low
expression in young blade and stem was reported. We
also observed low expression in the stem tissue, however, our young flag leaf tissue showed relatively high
expression. It is possible that our young, but fully developed, flag leaf sample resembles their mature blade
more than their young blade. Finally, Robertson [43]
reported barely detectable expression levels in the roots,
while we observed root levels similar to the low expression in the stem.
No expression patterns were reported for HvIDEF2
(HvNAC028), besides it being isolated from a root
cDNA library [45]. Interestingly, this gene was one of
the most stably expressed genes across all eight tissues.
Likewise, no HvNAM-1 (HvNAC029) induction was
reported [12,46]. However, we did observe a significant
induction in the senescing flag leaf, which would be
expected for an orthologue of TtNAM-B1.
The overall results presented in figure 3 emphasize the
suggested involvement of NAC transcription factors as
regulatory factors in a range of processes during plant
development and stress responses. We will focus here
on a few selected genes and discuss their expression patterns in comparison to the known and suggested functions of phylogenetically related NAC genes.
SCWB has been the focus of several NAC gene studies, and many NAC genes have been shown to regulate
aspects of this process. HvNAC039 is clearly up-regulated in the developing stem tissue, where extensive
SCWB is expected to take place. Considering that
HvNAC039 belongs to subgroup NAC-g-9, as do both
SND2, SND3 (ANAC073 and ANAC010, respectively),
and PopNAC154, a role in SCWB is not unlikely for
this NAC gene. HvNAC033 and HvNAC034 are also upregulated in the stem tissue and may thus regulate
aspects of the SCWB as well. Protein alignments identified HvNAC033 as a possible orthologue of both NST1
(ANAC043) and MtNST1. Furthermore, considering the
expression data, HvNAC033 is very likely an NST
orthologue. HvNAC034 is very closely related to
HvNAC033, both belonging to subgroup NAC-c-3, and
therefore also related to NST1 and MtNST1. Both
HvNAC033 and HvNAC034 are also up-regulated in the
developing young ear, where a high degree of SCWB is
also expected to take place, supporting the hypothesis
that they could be regulators of this process.
Leaf senescence has also been the focus of several
NAC gene studies. There are several HvNACs which are
up-regulated in the senescing flag leaf, however, by
including the relative expression levels across the old
ear and late dough grain tissues, three genes stand out:

Christiansen et al. BMC Research Notes 2011, 4:302
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/4/302

HvNAC005, HvNAC027, and HvNAC029. HvNAC029 is
an orthologue of NAM-B1 from wheat and has furthermore been mapped to a quantitative trait locus (QTL)
for leaf senescence in barley [46], clearly supporting the
hypothesis of a role for this transcription factor in leaf
senescence regulation. HvNAC005 and HvNAC027 both
belong to subgroup NAC-a-6, as does the Arabidopsis
senescence regulator AtNAP (ANAC029), suggesting a
possible link to senescence. Both are also found to be
up-regulated following ABA treatment, adding further
evidence, as ABA is known to be an inducer of senescence [48].
Three highly up-regulated HvNAC genes were found
in the root tissue: HvNAC021, HvNAC022, and
HvNAC032. This could indicate roles in root development, especially as they all belong to subfamily NAC-d,
as do both NAC1 (ANAC021) and ORE1 (ANAC092).
Although it is possible that all three are involved in regulating root development, HvNAC022 stands out as
being phylogenetically very closely related to NAC1 as
well as being down-regulated in the presence of ABA,
which is known to have an inhibitory effect on lateral
root formation [53]. Using the online GeneVestigator
software (http://www.genevestigator.com/gv/), it was
confirmed that Arabidopsis NAC1 is also down-regulated by ABA in an experiment very similar to the one
presented here (Experiment ID: AT-00231). These
results support the hypothesis that at least HvNAC022
is a putative regulator of root development.
HvNAC017, HvNAC018, HvNAC019 and HvNAC024
form, together with HvNAC009, a small barley-specific
group of NAC transcription factors with no clear orthologues in other plant species investigated so far. The
gene expression patterns in the data presented here
indicate that these four genes could regulate aspects of
seed development. This hypothesis might be supported
by results of Guo et al. [54] and Verza et al. [55]. They
reported on the expression of two maize NAC genes
ZmNRP-1 and ZmAPN-1, respectively. Both of these
genes are closely related to the barley specific group,
although they do not appear as direct orthologues. It
was found that ZmNRP-1 had endosperm specific
expression [54] and that ZmAPN-1 expression was
restricted to the aleurone cell layer [55].
Many NAC genes that have been found to be involved
in various forms of stress responses and tolerances, and
very often the same genes are also found to be induced
by stress hormones. In order to get an initial overview
of the involvement of the HvNAC family in stress regulation, we tested the effects of treatment with the two
stress hormones ABA and MeJA on HvNAC expression.
Notably, most of the significant changes happened after
five hours of treatment. This could either be due to a
secondary wave of gene induction or to generally slow

Page 9 of 13

inductions, perhaps related to our experimental setup.
Another observation from our data is that some of the
ABA-induced genes were phylogenetically related, i.e.
belong to the same subgroup. HvNAC027 stood out as
being highly responsive to both hormones, suggesting it
could have a putative role in stress tolerance regulation.
TaNAC69 from wheat, a direct orthologue of
HvNAC027, displays a similar induction from ABA as
well as induction by drought and cold [56].

Conclusions
In this work we have compiled available sequences from
public databases that represent 48 members of the NAC
gene family in barley. The list of barley NAC genes is,
evidently, not exhaustive, since a number of additional
members exist in NAC gene families of the closely
related species Brachypodium and rice.
From the data presented here, we have identified possible regulators of secondary cell wall synthesis
(HvNAC033, HvNAC034, and HvNAC039), leaf senescence (HvNAC005, HvNAC027, and HvNAC029), and
root development (HvNAC022). Furthermore, we have
identified putative regulators of processes in seed development (HvNAC017, HvNAC018, HvNAC019).
The results presented here support the idea that the
functional roles of NAC transcription factors are conserved throughout both monocot and dicot species.
Furthermore, they clearly demonstrate that the qRTPCR approach for an initial characterization of the barley NAC family was a good choice. Most of the genes
selected as putative regulators of particular processes,
based on the qRT-PCR results, were either direct orthologues of, or at least very closely related to, NAC genes
from other species, specifically known to regulate these
processes.
Methods
Identification of HvNACs

All publicly available barley nucleotide sequences were
collected from the Nucleotide, GSS, EST and UniGene
databases of the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and
Plant Genomic Database (http://www.plantgdb.org/).
These sequences were searched for the presence of barley NAC gene sequences using the tBLASTn algorithm.
The NAC domain of all available Brachypodium distachyon and Oryza sativa NAC protein sequences were used
as input for the BLAST function. Contig assembly was
performed using the CAP3 algorithm [57]. As the vast
majority of the collected sequences were in the form of
expressed sequence tags (ESTs), each contig was manually inspected due to the error prone nature of ESTs. In
the case that a contig was considered to be erroneous
based on the translated protein sequence, all ESTs of

Christiansen et al. BMC Research Notes 2011, 4:302
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/4/302

the contig were carefully inspected and the contig
manually corrected, if applicable. In order to obtain
more full-length CDS sequences, partial length EST
clones were re-sequenced or cloned and sequenced
when possible. Primers used for cloning were based on
homologous wheat or Brachypodium sequences.
Phylogenetic analysis

All phylogenetic analyses were performed on the NAC
domain part of each gene. Each HvNAC protein
sequence was manually truncated immediately following
the E subdomain as defined in Ooka et al. [5].
Sequences lacking a defined E subdomain were truncated based on multiple alignments of all HvNACs proteins. All alignments and phylogenetic trees were made
using ClustalX 2.1 [58]. The phylogenetic tree in additional file 1 was drawn using the ape add-on package
[59] of the R software [60].

leaf pieces were taken for RNA isolation at 0, 1, 3, and
5 hours after the unset of hormone treatment. At 0
hours only the control sample was taken.
RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis

RNA isolation was performed on approximately 100 mg
of frozen homogenized material using the Spectrum™
Plant Total RNA kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. First-strand cDNA synthesis
was performed on 3-5 μg of RNA and a nonamer, random oligonucleotide primer (2.5 μM) by incubation at
65°C for 5 min followed by 10 min at RT in a volume
of 18,4 μL. 200 U SuperscriptII (Invitrogen), 40 U RNAsin (Promega), 1 × FS Buffer (Invitrogen), 10 μM
dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane 1,4-dithiothreitol
(DDT), and 2 mM dNTPs (GE Healthcare) were added
to make a final volume of 30 μl, which was incubated
for 1 hour at 42°C and 10 min at 70°C, followed by the
addition of 70 μl of water.

Plant material and treatments

Barley plants, cv. Golden Promise, were grown in greenhouse soil plots. Artificial illumination was used for supplementation and for ensuring a day/night cycle of 16/8
hr. All sampling were done between 12 noon and 2 pm,
and samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately
after being harvested. For all tissue samples, three biological replicates were harvested and processed in parallel.
The samples were stored at -80°C until RNA extraction
was performed. Plants from which the roots were
sampled were grown in individual pots containing perlite
(Nordisk Perlite, Denmark), and sampling was performed
when the plantlets were at the three leaf stage.
Young flag leaf material was harvested at the heading
stage when the leaf was fully developed, and senescing
flag leaves when green leaf area was reduced to approximately 50%. Young ear material was harvested immediately after heading, and the old ear material when the
seeds were close to full maturity. The milk and late
dough grain material comprised individual grains in the
early milk stage and late dough stage, respectively. The
stem samples comprised the lower approximately 5-6 cm
of culms from the second internode from the top harvested just prior to heading. Young, light green leaves
from small plantlets were sampled for genomic DNA
(gDNA) isolation used for qRT-PCR primer testing.
For treatments with ABA and MeJA, young flag leaves
were taken just prior to heading. In order to encounter
developmental differences, the basal 10 cm of the leaves
was divided into six pieces that were distributed across
different time points of the time-course study. Hormone
treatments were done in 10 ml water containing 50 μM
hormone (dissolved in DMSO) and 0.005% Triton-X
100. Controls were treated with 0.005% Triton-X 100
and 0.1% DMSO. Two replicate samples comprising five

Genomic DNA isolation

DNA was extracted from 1-2 g of leaf material using a
DNA extraction buffer consisting of 1% Sodium lauroyl
sarcosinate (sarkosyl), 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 100
mM NaCl, 10 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(EDTA), 2% Polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP) followed
by standard phenol/chloroform/isoamyl-alcohol separation and ethanol precipitation. The DNA was dissolved
in 500 μl R40 (40 ug/ml RNAse A in 1 × TE) on an
orbital shaker at 4°C overnight.
Primer design and efficiency

To ensure specificity of each HvNAC primer pair, the
online Primique software [61] was used to design primer
sets for qRT-PCR. All other primers were designed with
Oligo Explorer 1.2 from Gene Link, Inc. qRT-PCR primer
sequences are listed in additional file 3. All primers were
tested for their efficiency on gDNA. gDNA was used
instead of cDNA, since many of the HvNAC genes were
expected to have low expression levels. As such, measures were taken to avoid intron spanning amplicons
during the design of the primers. Four dilutions of gDNA
were used in the testing: 1, 1/8, 1/64, and 1/512 as well
as a zero template control. Average values for three technical replicates were plotted against the concentration,
and the efficiency was calculated from the slope of the
best linear regression, using the formula: efficiency = 10^
(-1/slope) [62]. Efficiencies of 2 ± 0.2 were acceptable.
Primers were also tested without any template to ensure
that no primer dimer products would occur.
qRT-PCR

Quantitative real-time PCR was performed in 384 well
plates using the ABI Prism7900HT Sequence Detection

Christiansen et al. BMC Research Notes 2011, 4:302
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/4/302

System with the Power SYBR® Green PCR master mix
(Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations. 0.5 μl of cDNA was used for each
qRT-PCR reaction and all tests were performed with
three technical replicates. For each qRT-PCR run a dissociation stage was included, in order to be used in
quality assessments of each sample during data analysis.
The threshold cycle (Ct) for each run was determined
using the automatic settings for baseline and threshold
level of the ABI Prism 7900HT SDS software.
Analysis of qRT-PCR data

Ct values exported from the ABI Prism 7900HT SDS
software were used as raw data for the analysis of qRTPCR data. The R software [60] and the add-on packages
HTqPCR [63] and Limma [64] were used for the manipulation and analysis of the Ct values, and for generation
of heatmaps of gene expression data. qRT-PCR runs
showing high variation among technical replicates were
manually inspected, and clear outliers and runs with
aberrant dissociation curves were excluded from the
analysis. Several possible reference genes were tested for
their stability across different tissues, using the tools in
the R package SLqPCR [65]. Based on this analysis, the
barley 18 S ribosomal RNA gene was selected as the
most stable reference gene to be used in the normalization of gene expression of NAC genes in different tissues
and treatments.
