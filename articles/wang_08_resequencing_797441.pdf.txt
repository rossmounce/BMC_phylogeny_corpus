Abstract
Background: Febrile respiratory illness (FRI) has a high impact on public health and global
economics and poses a difficult challenge for differential diagnosis. A particular issue is the
detection of genetically diverse pathogens, i.e. human rhinoviruses (HRV) and enteroviruses (HEV)
which are frequent causes of FRI. Resequencing Pathogen Microarray technology has demonstrated
potential for differential diagnosis of several respiratory pathogens simultaneously, but a high
confidence design method to select probes for genetically diverse viruses is lacking.
Results: Using HRV and HEV as test cases, we assess a general design strategy for detecting and
serotyping genetically diverse viruses. A minimal number of probe sequences (26 for HRV and 13
for HEV), which were potentially capable of detecting all serotypes of HRV and HEV, were
determined and implemented on the Resequencing Pathogen Microarray RPM-Flu v.30/31 (Tessarae
RPM-Flu). The specificities of designed probes were validated using 34 HRV and 28 HEV strains. All
strains were successfully detected and identified at least to species level. 33 HRV strains and 16
HEV strains could be further differentiated to serotype level.
Conclusion: This study provides a fundamental evaluation of simultaneous detection and
differential identification of genetically diverse RNA viruses with a minimal number of prototype
sequences. The results demonstrated that the newly designed RPM-Flu v.30/31 can provide
comprehensive and specific analysis of HRV and HEV samples which implicates that this design
strategy will be applicable for other genetically diverse viruses.

Background
Human febrile respiratory illness (FRI) results in significant annual health and economic burden worldwide, but

the diversity and number of pathogens make differential
diagnosis very challenging. Thus, it represents a useful
example where many organisms ranging from bacteria

(Haemophilus influenzae) to fairly conserved viruses (respiratory syncytial virus) to genetically diverse viruses, i.e.
influenza A virus, human rhinoviruses (HRV), and
human enteroviruses (HEV) need to be detected for successful differential diagnosis. Several technologies, Masscode™ multiplex RT-PCR system [1], electrospray
ionization mass spectrometry analysis of PCR amplicons
[2], Luminex® xMAP™ [3], and various microarray-based
approaches [4-8], are currently under development as
diagnostic platforms to effectively and simultaneously
detect and identify large numbers of diverse viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens. One high-density resequencing microarray platform, the Respiratory Pathogen
Microarray version 1 (RPM v.1), has been successfully
demonstrated to identify a much broader range of pathogens (including bacteria and DNA and RNA viruses) in a
single test at sensitivities and specificities that are similar
to or improved over those of other technologies [9,10]. In
addition, the RPM v.1 platform has the demonstrated
capability to discriminate among known and previously
unknown strains and variants of targeted pathogens
[11,12].
While promising, the RPM v.1 platform was a proof-ofconcept microarray for the detection of 26 common respiratory pathogens primarily encountered among military
basic trainees. It did not provide comprehensive coverage
of all potential respiratory pathogens and the design
methodology used was not appropriate for genetically
diverse viruses. The design methodology for the RPM v.1
microarray consisted of applying selection rules developed for long oligonucleotide microarrays. These rules
were not optimal but worked for bacterial organisms and
fairly conserved viruses since previous studies had shown
a single sequence on a resequencing microarray could reliably detect and serotype strains with as much as 10 to
15% variation [8,10-12]. Their application to cover more
diverse viral organisms was less successful. For example,
the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) sequence chosen for
HRV on the RPM v.1 only provided identification of the
prototype HRV-89 and very little coverage of other HRV
serotypes. The 5'UTR sequences, which are relatively conserved among HRV and HEV, have been used in PCR and
de novo sequencing for tentative viral identification or
serotype classification in lieu of the much more variable
capsid proteins that actually determine serotypes [13,14].
However, the 5'UTR sequences still have ~5 to 30% nucleotide sequence variations among different serotypes so
require more than one prototype sequence for proper
identification and serotyping. Serotyping HRV and HEV is
important to FRI differential diagnosis because even
though these "common cold" viruses generally only
induce mild symptoms, they can cause a wide variety of
other severe illnesses, such as aseptic meningitis [15],
bronchitis and asthma [16].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/577

New resequencing pathogen microarray designs, versions
3.0 and 3.1 (RPM-Flu v.30/31), have been constructed to
address the shortcomings of the previous design. The use
of 8 μm feature allows microarrays with greater coverage,
currently 86, of common respiratory organisms and high
human health risk zoonotic pathogens (bacteria and
viruses). A new approach to select a minimal number of
prototype sequences that can be used to detect all and correctly identify many of the relevant strains of genetically
diverse viruses such as HRV and HEV was developed. Due
to the great genetic diversity of HRV and HEV, in order to
ensure that designed probes (referred to as probe
sequences) generated from selected database sequences
(referred to as prototype regions) would detect and discriminate all serotypes of HRV and HEV, a predictive
model was used to assist the microarray design [17]. This
in silico model developed for predicting resequencing
microarray hybridization patterns shows good concordance in the overall percentage of base calls predicted versus experimental results. Thus it is possible to use this
model for evaluating the performance of database
sequences as potential prototype regions. In this study, we
report on results of this algorithm applied to the 5'UTR
sequences of HRV and HEV and confirm that using ~15%
of the RPM-Flu v.30/31 microarray (17,335 HRV and HEV
nucleotides of total 117,254 nucleotides on array) is sufficient to detect and differentiate many HRV and HEV
serotypes.

Microarray design process
In silico modeling
Figure 1 illustrates the procedures used for the selection of
HRV and HEV probe sequences. First, sequences that contain the specified target region (5'UTR) and meet any
selection criteria applied were downloaded from a database (currently GenBank). Downloaded sequences were
trimmed to cover the same region using pair-wise
sequence alignment. These sequences were treated as target sequences (what would be detected by the microarray)
and also as prototype sequences (the potential probe
sequences tiled on the microarray). Each downloaded
sequence was treated as a prototype used to generate
probe sequences (Fig 1. Step 1–2) and the remaining
sequences were treated as target sequences (Fig 1. Step 3–
4). Sets of 4 25-mer probes (1 perfect match and 3 mismatches in the 13th position) were generated from a prototype sequence and correspond to what would actually
appear on a resequencing microarray. The other
sequences were treated as a target one at a time and generated overlapping fragments from 13 to 25 bases long with
a near neighbor ΔG energy less than -14.5. These fragments have been shown to have strong binding strength
and produce unique base calls. The generated probes and
sequence fragments were the input to the in silico model

probe sets and determined the base calls a target sequence
would generate. The predicted base calls were assembled
into a simulated resequencing microarray result.
Probe sequence selection
The simulated result of a target sequence for the current
prototype sequence was then run through the previously
developed CIBSI analysis algorithm [8] with the following
criteria. A sequence was considered detected by the cur-

rent prototype sequence if at least one region of 50 or
more contiguous nucleotides was predicted to consist of
A, C, G, and T base calls and no ambiguous base calls
(Ns). As shown in Figure 1 "Yes" for "CIBSI would identify" updated the list of sequences that could be detected
by the current prototype sequence. This procedure was
applied for every downloaded sequence. For example, if
we collect sequences "a-z" from GenBank, we will first use
sequence "a" as a prototype sequence, then use sequences
"b-z" each in turn to generate target sequences for in silico

simulation. After the completion of the simulation and
CIBSI analysis, a list of sequences from the pool of
sequences "b-z" that can be detected by prototype
sequence "a" will be generated. Then the cycle begins
again with sequence 'b" as prototype sequence, while
sequences "a, c-z" each in turn is used as target sequences
to generate the list for sequence "b". The cycle will continue until we generate the list for all download sequences
(sequences 'a-z"). After this is completed, the second stage
of the process will be undertaken. The number of
sequences that a sequence (as prototype) is predicted to
detect will be sorted and ordered. The sequence that was
predicted to detect the most other sequences (as targets)
was selected as a probe sequence to be used in the microarray design. It was then removed from the list of
sequences. All the target sequences detected by that prototype sequence were also removed from the list of
sequences. This procedure was repeated until the list of
sequences was empty. When two or more prototype
sequences were predicted to detect the same maximal
number of target sequences, one was randomly selected
hence the method was non-deterministic. The process was
repeated with different random seeds and the number of
required probe sequences did not vary significantly while
the sequences used in the microarray design could change.
Application: HRV and HEV
The described design method could be applied to any
group of sequences and a minimum set of prototype
regions would be determined. The group of sequences
used for HRV probe design was chosen using different criteria than those used to select the HEV sequences in the
HEV probe design due to differences in the available
sequences for each in GenBank. At the time of this design,
only eight HRV serotypes had complete genomes
sequenced. These genome sequences and all complete and
partial 5'UTR sequences available for HRV in GenBank
were retrieved in April 2006 and a total of 150 sequences
were used in the predictive modeling. A set of 26
sequences with lengths between 145 and 500 bp were predicted to provide detection of all those input sequences
(Additional file 1).

Because HEV is better characterized with complete
genome sequences of all 60 recognized serotypes, the
design algorithm was applied to one complete genome
sequence of each serotype. In addition, the design algorithm was applied to the 3D region. The design procedure
generated 4 to 8 sequences for HEV detection using 5'UTR
region, and 13 sequences were predicted to detect all HEV
3D regions. It was decided to use corresponding 5'UTR
sequences of the 13 genomes that the 3D targets were
selected from so that the same serotype was targeted by
both target regions (Additional file 1). These 13 5'UTR

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/577

regions were predicted to still provide complete and now
redundant coverage.
Specificity of RPM-Flu v.30/31 chip for HRV detection and
serotyping: design method 1
To assess the performance of RPM-Flu v.30/31 chip
design, 34 known HRV serotype strains obtained from
ATCC were tested. Of the 34 strains, 18 had corresponding 5'UTR sequences tiled on the microarray and were
called prototype serotypes, which were used to verify the
accuracy of the designed HRV probes. The remaining 16
strains, representing near neighbor serotypes, were
selected from diverse clades based on phylogenetic classification of HRV serotypes [18,19]. These strains were used
to investigate the capability of the microarray to detect
other HRV serotypes that did not have their sequences
tiled on the microarray. Overall, the selected strains covered every single clade of 101 HRV serotypes based on
phylogenetic analysis of the P1–P2 regions of 5'UTR
sequences [18]. One metric of the hybridization in a reference region is to divide the number of bases reported as A,
C, G, or T by the total number of bases for that region
(probe length), which we refer to as the base call rate and
proportionally reflects the hybridization strength or
homology between the prototype and target sequences. A
hybridization profile (Fig. 2A) using the base call rates
clearly showed a unique pattern for each serotype. The
closely related serotypes with less nucleotide divergences
had similar hybridization profiles across the tiled regions,
so it is possible to assign species (HRVA and HRVB) based
only on the hybridization patterns. The brighter red spots
(higher base call rates) along the diagonal suggested that
stronger hybridizations between the tiled probes and
5'UTRs from the prototype serotypes. It is also of note that
HRV87 does not fall into either of two major clusters
which agrees with other findings that it should really be
classified as a HEV [20,21]. To validate the accuracy of the
array clustering, 5'UTR of each serotype was amplified by
type-specific RT-PCR and subjected to conventional
sequencing. The phylogenetic tree derived from the de
novo 5'UTR sequences (Additional file 2) confirms the
HRVA and HRVB classification. Pair-wise sequence comparisons also indicated that the average nucleotide divergence of 5'UTR sequences between all 34 strains was
20.3%. The maximal nucleotide divergences among
HRVA and HRVB strains were 33.4% and 32.7%, respectively. These results demonstrated that RPM-Flu v.30/31
chip is potentially capable of detecting genetically diverse
HRV serotypes.

Although useful, the visual patterns are difficult to discriminate the serotypes within each species and would
require generating reference patterns for all HRV serotypes. The use of sequence calls and analysis software,
CIBSI [22], allows for straightforward serotype identifica-

tion. The sequence analysis results showed that the identifications made by RPM-Flu v.30/31 and CIBSI are
consistent with the reported typing, and could clearly differentiate most of the serotypes of the HRV (Table 1). Of
the 34 HRV strains, 18 matched the selected prototype 5'
UTR sequences on the RPM-Flu v.30/31 chips and showed
strong hybridization signals to their corresponding prototype regions generating at least 86% base call rates. Due to
the sequence homology, it is not surprising to find a
noticeable and sometimes significant amount of hybridization (20 – 80%) leading to base calls on prototype
regions other than the correspondent prototype for most
samples. Because the identification scheme used was
based on comparing the sequences generated on the array

to database entries, this information could be integrated
into the final identification. For these samples with high
base call rates, the best hit would have tens to hundreds
more matched bases than the next best hit. The remaining
16 ATCC strains represent near neighbor serotypes, which
5'UTR sequences share >80% identifies to those of prototypes. In all but the case of HRV5, the information was
sufficient to identify the correct serotypes. In these samples, the difference in the number of base calls matching
in the best hit and the next best hit was more variable and
on average was fewer. The confidence of the identification
depends on the accuracy of the base call. Since the best hit
always had at least one base that matched the resequencing results and was a mismatch for the next best hit, it was

possible to establish the lowest confidence level that the
best hit was the correct identification. The resequencing
microarray's accuracy for determining the base call has
been established under a variety of conditions [23]. Using
this information, there is a .000001n that the next best hit
is the most similar sequence in the database because a
base is misidentified by the resequencing microarray
where n is the number of mismatches between the next
best hit and the matches for the best result. With .0001%
being the largest level of uncertainty seen for these samples, it was deemed acceptable to treat the best hit as the
correct identification. For HRV5, several database
sequences representing different serotypes had the same
score and since no further information was available it
was only possible to determine that a HRV species B was
present. The 5'UTR sequences from the tested strains generated with de novo sequencing were subjected to in silico

predictive modeling analysis and the result of this was
used as input in the CIBSI analysis program. For the case
of HRV5, the in silico model predicted a larger fraction of
base calls being made than were observed in the experiment. For all other samples there was a good correspondence on base call fractions between model and experiment
as expected. This leads us to suspect there was a processing
error or sample degradation leading to the less accurate
identification.
Specificity of RPM-Flu v.30/31 chip for HEV detection and
serotyping: design method 2
A panel of 28 HEV serotypes, including serotypes from all
four HEV species, was similarly used to validate the specificity of RPM-Flu v.30/31 for HEV detection and identification. These serotypes were originally typed based on VP1
sequences (personal communication – Steve Oberste)

and the majority of them belonged to members of HEVB.
The hybridization profile (Figure 2B) shows distinct clusters in a similar fashion to the HRV samples based on
serotypes. In this case, HEVA and HEVB make up one cluster, while HEVC and HEVD (including HRV87) comprise
a second cluster. This finding is consistent with the previously described clusters for HEV UTR sequences [24,25].
The redundancy of the targets that was a consequence of
how they were selected is apparent in the more uniform
response observed within each cluster to the various
strains.
Analysis of sequences reported from RPM-Flu 30/31 array
analysis indicated that two levels of identifications were
obtained from 28 strains (Table 2). Serotype level identification was made for 11 of the 28 strains, in which 9 cases
correlated with typing made by the VP1 genes. For example, HEV71 and Coxsackievirus A16 (CAVA16), known to
cause hand-foot-mouth disease, were unambiguously recognized as HEV71 and CAVA16 respectively using RPMFlu v.30/31 and analysis program. Two strains were identified by RPM-Flu v.30/31 as HEV4 and HEV5, results in
agreement with the conventional sequencing of each

5'UTR. However, the strains as provided by CDC were
identified as HEV6 and CAVB3 respectively, based on the
VP1 region. Specific serotypes could not be identified for
the remaining sixteen samples using the sequence read
generated from the array. Nevertheless these samples were
easily categorized into the respective species. Due to
amplification problems only a subset of strains were successfully de novo sequenced, which showed 3 – 18% variations in 5'UTR sequences. The base call rates obtained by
in silico predictions based on the de novo sequences were
similar to the microarray results and the identifications
agreed in all but one case.

Discussion
This study demonstrated the use of an algorithm for the
design of probe sets based on an in silico predictive model
[17], developed by our group, that minimized the probes
needed for detection and identification of most serotypes
of HRV and HEV. The potential of using resequencing
microarray for simultaneous detection and identification
of highly diverse respiratory pathogens, such as HRV and
HEV, was also demonstrated. The conserved nature of the
5' UTR regions of HRV and HEV genomes and the capabil-

ities of the resequencing microarray allow serotype level
identification of near-neighbor serotypes of HRV and
HEV, when long (> 100 nucleotides) sequences are read
from the array. Identifications can be still made for shorter
length sequences to the species level particularly when the
array has one or more such sequences derived from different probes.

not the case for the 5'UTR region [29-33]. Our results
show that the 5'UTR region did not correlate as closely as
VP1-based typing to antigenic type definitions for HEV
unlike how it performed for HRV. While the 5'UTR region
is sufficient to accurately identify the groupings, a design
using VP1 as the probe region is needed to provide serotyping identifications that will match classical methods.

The utility of the resequencing microarray is related to the
target selection, the optimized prototype sequences represented on the array. In the case of RPM-Flu v.30/31, the
selection of HRV targets has proved to be very robust. The
5'UTR has been shown in this study to be a good choice
for serotyping HRV on RPM, as it performed similarly well
on other platforms [13,26]. All HRV variants tested in this
study could be detected and identified at least to the species level. The limited number of HRV sequences available
in GenBank during the time of design of RPM-Flu v.30/31
rendered a few of the targets represented on RPM-Flu
v.30/31 are shorter than 200 bp. In the past year, complete genome sequences from 46 more serotypes and
another two divergent HRV'X's have been reported
[6,19,27]. It will be worthwhile to update the design for
the next generation of the chip.

The current RPM design can detect and identify a more
comprehensive set of viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens in parallel, including detailed discrimination of certain serotypes of HRV and HEV. This study showed that
most shortcomings in the design were a result of not
including adequate reference sequences for the initial
design. The selection of VP1 and 3D regions also showed
that incorporation of primer design considerations must
be contemplated sooner in the design process than it has
been currently done to prevent the selection of regions
that cannot be used. Future development will address
these limitations by reducing HEV probe redundancy and
lack of coverage, by updating or confirming the HRV
probes to be derived from newly available HRV
sequences, and by involving primer design earlier in the
overall design process.

In the case of HEV, the RPM-Flu v.30/31 assay identified
only 11 of 28 strains tested at serotype level. Several
strains not producing serotype identifications might have
been indicative of assay protocol issues or probe design.
The fact that the in silico model prediction was also not
serotype specific indicates it was most likely a design
issue. This was further confirmed by agreement in base
calls made from the resequencing microarray and from
conventional resequencing. Although all the strains of
HEV have complete genome sequences, there are also
many partial sequence submissions for each strain in GenBank that were ignored for the HEV design. A re-examination of the 5'UTR regions showed up to 14% difference in
sequences grouped in the same serotype. This indicates
that a redesign of the HEV prototype regions is needed
where selection of a minimal set of prototype regions
would be based on all available 5'UTR sequence data
(complete and partial) and not a subset of genome
sequences.

Conclusion

Comparing the identifications made from de novo
sequencing to the identifications made by CDC (sources
of the samples) illustrated another shortcoming of using
the 5'UTR region for HEV that did not occur for HRV.
Oberste et al. demonstrated that typing based upon HEV
VP1 capsid gene sequences showed excellent correlation
with serotype determined by classical antigenic methods
[28]. Thus amplification and sequencing of the partial
VP1 amino-terminal coding region has been accepted as a
standard molecular typing method for HEV but such is

A powerful feature of the expanded RPM-Flu v.30/31 resequencing pathogen microarray is that the nucleotide
sequences generated from hybridization of the sample
RNA/DNA and array-bound probe sets in conjunction
with previously developed sequence analysis algorithm
CIBSI can be easily interpreted to make serotype or strain
identifications. This feature and the platform's high resolution and high throughput aspects undoubtedly have
great potential for use as a diagnostic tool, and therefore,
efforts are currently underway to test the utility of this
array on more clinical samples. The results presented also
validated the usefulness of the design methodology and it
is currently being applied to assist in a new microarray
application associated with other genetically diverse
viruses.

Methods
Viral strains, specimen and nucleic acid isolation
A panel of 27 cultured enterovirus (HEV) prototype
strains was purchased from Center for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC, Atlanta, GA). The prototype strains
of 34 rhinoviruses (HRV) and HEV69 with known titers
were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). Total nucleic acids were
extracted from 125 μl cultured samples by using the MasterPure™ DNA purification kit (Epicentre Technologies,
Madison, WI) and dissolved in 20 μl of nuclease-free
water.

Primer design
All 5'UTR sequences of HRV and HEV with approximately
750 bp sizes were downloaded from GenBank. Potential
PCR primer pairs that are able to amplify 600 – 700 bp
fragments from HRV and HEV were automatically selected
by a perl script primer search program developed by our
group using the rules described in previous publication
[10,11].
Multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
The multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) protocols for RPM-Flu v.30/31 were
carried out as previously described [10] with the following
modifications. For the RT step, primer LN was replaced by
primer NLN (a random 9mer with the unique linker
sequence), 1 pg each of two internal controls NAC1 and
triosephosphate isomerase (TIM), and 5 μl of the
extracted viral nucleic acids were used. The 5 μl RT reaction product was subjected to the multiplex PCR reaction.
Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) was replaced by GoTaq® DNA
polymerase (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI) in the
PCR reaction. Primer NL instead of primer L was used
with 50–150 nM each of 5'UTR primers in the multiplex
PCR. The amplification reaction was carried out in a Peltier Thermal Cycler – PTC240 DNA Engine Tetrad 2 (MJ
Research Inc., Reno, NV) with an initial incubation at
25°C for 10 min, then preliminary denaturation at 94°C
for 2 min followed by 16 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 45–60°C
for 30 s (incremental increase of 1°C per cycle), and 72°C
for 90 s, then 24 cycles of 94°C for 30 s and 60°C for 120
s.

based on nucleic acid sequence alignment, which was
developed and tested in detail in previous studies [10,11].
The NCBI BLAST and taxonomy databases used for CIBSI
analysis was downloaded in December 2007. Heat-map
and clustering dendrogram was made with dChip 2005
(DNA-Chip Analyzer, http://www.dchip.org). The rows of
the imported data (base call rates) were standardized and
clustered. Clustering distance was 1 – correlation with
average linkage, and gene ordering by cluster tightness.
DNA sequencing and analysis
5'UTR sequences were amplified from HRV- or HEV cDNA
with specific primers. Amplified products were purified
and sent to Macrogen USA (Gaithersburg, MD) for automated Sanger/electrophoresis-based sequencing using
corresponding specific primers. Phylogenetic analysis of
5'UTR sequences was performed by using neighbor-joining method in MEGA software http://www.megasoft
ware.net. All nucleotide sequences used in this study are
available at GenBank (accession nos. EU870449–
EU870493).

Additional material
Microarray hybridization and analysis
Microarray hybridization and processing, and the image
scanning were performed according to the manufacture's
recommended protocol (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA)
using a GenChip resequencing assay kit (Affymetrix) with
modification as previously described [10]. After scanning,
GCOS software was used to reduce the raw image (.DAT)
file to a simplified file format (.CEL file) with intensities
assigned to each of the corresponding probe positions.
GDAS software was then used to produce nucleotide reads
(A, C, G and T) or base calls, comparing the respective
intensities for the sense and antisense probe sets. The
sequences from base calls made for each tiled region of
the resequencing microarray were exported from GDAS as
the FASTA-formatted files. Base call rate refers percentage
of number of base calls generated from the full length of
probe in each tile.
