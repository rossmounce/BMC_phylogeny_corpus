Abstract
Background: Chemosensory systems play key roles in the survival and reproductive success of
insects. Insect chemoreception is mediated by two large and diverse gene superfamilies,
chemoreceptors and odorant binding proteins (OBPs). OBPs are believed to transport
hydrophobic odorants from the environment to the olfactory receptors.
Results: We identified a family of OBP-like genes in the silkworm genome and characterized their
expression using oligonucleotide microarrays. A total of forty-four OBP genes were annotated, a
number comparable to the 57 OBPs known from Anopheles gambiae and 51 from Drosophila
melanogaster. As seen in other fully sequenced insect genomes, most silkworm OBP genes are
present in large clusters. We defined six subfamilies of OBPs, each of which shows lineage-specific
expansion and diversification. EST data and OBP expression profiles from multiple larvae tissues of
day three fifth instars demonstrated that many OBPs are expressed in chemosensory-specific
tissues although some OBPs are expressed ubiquitously and others exclusively in nonchemosensory tissues. Some atypical OBPs are expressed throughout development. These results
reveal that, although many OBPs are chemosensory-specific, others may have more general
physiological roles.
Conclusion: Silkworms possess a number of OBPs genes similar to other insects. Their
expression profiles suggest that many OBPs may be involved in olfaction and gustation as well as
general carriers of hydrophobic molecules. The expansion of OBP gene subfamilies and sequence
divergence indicate that the silkworm OBP family acquired functional diversity concurrently with
functional constraints. Further investigation of the OBPs of the silkworm could give insights in the
roles of OBPs in chemoreception.

Background
Olfactory and gustatory systems play crucial roles for
insects in finding food, mates, and oviposition sites.

Exquisitely sensitive chemosensory systems of insects can
recognize and discriminate diverse chemicals. Olfaction is
mediated by specific olfactory sensory neurons, which

project their dendrites into a lymphatic cavity where odorant binding proteins (OBP) are present at high concentrations. It has been suggested that OBPs have key functions
in recognizing and delivering hydrophobic odorants to
olfactory receptors (OR) on dendritic membranes [1-4].
Insect OBPs are a class of small water-soluble extracellular
proteins with molecular masses of approximately 14 kDa
[5]. They are believed to serve multiple functions. For
example, OBPs may act as solubilizers and carriers of the
lipophilic odorants in sensillum lymph and also as semiselective filters in odorant discrimination. Furthermore,
OBPs may present odorants to activate neuronal receptors
or to sequester and deactivate odorants after stimulation
[3]. Experimental evidence has demonstrated that OBPs
could selectively bind odorants or pheromones [6-8].
Silkworm pheromone-binding protein 1 (BmPBP1) is
capable of enhancing sensitivity and selectively mediating
the response to bombykol rather than bombykal [9,10].
Recently, several studies have shown that OBPs are
required for correct recognition of some odors. In Drosophila, LUSH mutants are defective for avoidance of concentrated alcohols or benzaldehyde and have complete
loss of sensitivity to the pheromone 11-cis vaccenyl acetate [11-13]. LUSH undergoes a pheromone-specific conformational change that triggers the firing of pheromonesensitive neurons [14]. Two other odorant binding proteins for Drosophila, OBP57d and OBP57e, are not only
involved in taste perception but can also change the
behavioral response to toxins contained in fruit [15]. Four
polymorphisms in three OBP genes in the Obp99 cluster
are associated with variation in olfactory response to benzaldehyde in Drosophila [16]. In the fire ant, Solenopsis
invicta, allelic variantion in pheromone-binding protein
GP-9 regulates social organization of colonies. Singlequeen colonies are always homozygous for the B allele,
whereas multiple-queen colonies possess at least one copy
of the b variant [17].
Recent progress in whole-genome sequencing of insects
has provided insights into the molecular mechanisms of
olfaction. In the dipteran species D. melanogaster and A.
gambiae, more than 50 OBPs and approximately 70 Ors
have been identified [18-22]. Subsequently, 21 OBPs and
170 Ors have been annotated in the bee [23,24]. Insects
have far fewer ORs but more OBPs than do nematodes
and mammals [25]. In mammals, OBPs show fairly broad
binding spectra and seem capable of acting only as general
carriers [26]. It has been proposed that odorant discrimination in insects might be due to combined usage of ORs
and OBPs [19]. Nevertheless, insect OBPs have also been
found in non-chemosensory tissues, implicating them in
broader non-olfactory functions [27-29].
The silkworm, Bombyx mori is an oligophagous, economically important member of the Lepidoptera, a taxonomic

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/332

group that includes numerous pests of agriculture and forestry. Silkworm is a well-established model for studying
insect olfaction [30]. In addition, the olfactory system of
the giant sphinx moth Manduca sexta has been investigated in depth by the Hildebrand lab [31]. Studies of the
role of OBPs in molecular olfaction in silkworm may help
us to understand and manipulate olfactory-driven food
preference in this and other Lepidoptera. Prior to this
study, only four silkworm OBP genes had been reported
[32].
Our annotation of forty-four candidate BmorOBP genes
in the silkworm genome revealed lineage-specific subfamily expansions in the silkworm OBP family. Based on
a genome-wide oligonucleotide microarray, the expression profiles of 32 candidate BmorOBP genes were
detected in different tissues of day three 5th instar and
through development from fifth instars to adult moths.
Some BmorOBPs were specific to olfactory tissues and
others were expressed broadly in non-olfactory tissues.
We found several OBP genes whose expression patterns
were sexually dimorphic.

Results
The OBP gene family in the silkworm
We have identified a total of 44 candidate OBP genes in
the newly assembled silkworm genome (Table 1). These
include the four previously identified OBPs: PBP1 (pheromone binding protein), GOBP1 and GOBP2(general
odorant binding proteins), and ABPX (antennal binding
protein) [32]. Additionally, the PBP2 and PBP3 identified
herein have been deposited in GenBank (accession numbers AM403100 and AM403101). Thirty-five OBP-like
genes were predicted by the GLEAN algorithm, 17 of
which had their intron-exon boundaries corrected manually. Genomic regions containing another eight OBP
genes were predicted by FGENESH+ and exon/intron
splice site prediction software. We found many ESTs to
support the prediction of 24 of the OBP genes. Because of
the poor similarity of the signal peptide sequences, the
first exons were difficult to predict for seven of the OBPs.
OBP24 was incomplete, lacking the N-terminal region.
This gene may be intact in the genome or a pseudogene.
OBP9 was identified from EST data, but the entire gene is
missing from the current assembly of the genome. It is
possible that the current assembly does not cover the
entire genome. The corresponding annotations on the
Silkworm Genome Database (SilkDB) have been updated
http://silkworm.swu.edu.cn/silkdb/.
OBP genes are clustered in the genome
42 OBP genes were distributed across 10 chromosomes,
BmOBP28 is located on scaffold896, but cannot be
mapped to a chromosome based on the current genome
assembly (Figure 1, 2). More than three-quarters of the
silkworm OBP genes are located within clusters as also

seen in D. melanogaster, A. gambiae and A. mellifera
[19,22,23]. Twenty OBP genes are organized into five
clusters on five chromosomes. Of these gene clusters, only
Cluster 5 includes intervening genes. The largest cluster
(Cluster4) contains 12 OBP genes, which occur in both
orientations within a 90 kb region on chromosome 18.

Cluster5 (OBP1–6), including PBP1, GOBP1 and GOBP2
reported in previous studies, is located on chromosome
19 in the same orientation. Three non-OBP genes are
located between OBP1 and OBP2. Cluster1 (OBP22–27)
is located on chromosome 5. OBP26 is present in the
reverse orientation to the other members of the cluster.

Three smaller clusters (Cluster2, Cluster3 and Cluster6)
containing two or four genes are present on chromosome
7, 14 and 23. This genome organization, and especially
the presence of several large clusters, indicates a relatively
recent expansion of the silkworm OBP family.
Characteristics of the silkworm OBP family
Insect OBPs are generally quite divergent and the overall
pairwise sequence identity is modest [19]. The alignment
of the predicted silkworm OBP-like proteins (Figure 3)
shows low average pairwise sequence identity between
OBP family members. The predicted proteins have low
molecular masses (14–22 kDa) and signal sequences are
predicted at the hydrophobic N-terminus.

A six-cysteine signature is the most typical feature of classical insect OBPs [33]. The spacing pattern of conserved
cysteines in the silkworm OBP family is similar to that in
Drosophila. Following the naming system proposed by
Hekmat-Scafe et al. [19], we refer to OBPs missing C2 and
C5 as Minus-C OBPs, and those carrying more than six
conserved cysteine residues as Plus-C OBPs. All six
cysteine residues are completely conserved among twentynine typical silkworm OBPs. The spacing pattern of conserved cysteines in these typical OBPs is C1-X25–68-C2-X3C3-X31–46-C4-X8–29-C5-X8-C6 (where X is any amino
acid). There are ten Minus-C OBPs (OBP22–31) that are
missing the second and the fifth cysteines. Five Plus-C
OBP members (OBP40–44) carry additional conserved
cysteines located between C1 and C2 and after C6.
The majority of silkworm OBP genes carry 0–4 introns
that are located in conserved positions (Figure 3). Most
introns are inserted in phase 0 and 1. Generally, the first
intron is always present in phase 0, near the cleavage site
of the predicted signal peptide. Six classes of conserved
splice sites have been identified in the honey bee, D. melanogaster, A. gambiae, and T castaneum (Figure 3) [23]. The
splice sites in most silkworm OBPs belong to one of the
six classes. However, several genes appear to have introns
inserted in nonconserved positions or phases, such as
Cluster5 (Figure 3).
Phylogenetic analysis of the silkworm OBP family
The phylogenetic tree of the silkworm OBPs, constructed
using the neighbor-joining method (Figure 4), indicates
six possible protein subfamilies. Following the description by Hekmat-Scafe, we named these subfamilies as
PBP/GOBP, CRLBP, ABPI and ABPII as well as the two
atypical families Plus-C and Minus-C. High bootstrap values support many terminal relationships and three subfamilies: PBP/GOBP, Minus-C and ABPI. However there
was weak support for the other three subfamilies: ABPII,
Plus-C and CRLBP and the overall tree architecture. The
groupings are supported by a number of additional features.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/332

First, the spacing pattern of conserved cysteines is similar
within each subfamily. The spacings of C1–C2 and C4–C5
in the PBP/GOBP and ABPI subfamilies are larger than in
other subfamilies. By contrast, the spacing between C3
and C4 of Minus-C and ABPII is smaller than in the others. In all of the members of the Plus-C subfamily, C2 and
C3 are separated by four residues, while C5 and C6 are
separated by seven residues.
Second, the pairwise identity within each subfamily is
higher than that between members of different subfamilies. The PBP/GOBP subfamily has the highest average pairwise sequence identity (36%), with a range from
22% to 55%. The average identities for the ABPII and
Minus-C subfamilies are 35% and 29%, respectively. The
other three subfamilies have lower internal sequence
identities. Genes within the ABPI subfamily have lower
average identity values than those in the ABPII subfamily.
Third, subfamilies are supported by the chromosomal
clustering of OBP genes. The PBP/GOBP subfamily comprises the six members in Cluster 5. The Minus-C subfamily comprises nine members, of which seven occur in
Cluster 1 and Cluster 2. OBP28, which is located on a
small scaffold, shares high identity (78%) with OBP22.
The Plus-C subfamily comprises five members, of which
four members are located on chromosome 23. The CRLBP
subfamily comprises eight members. Six of these are on
chromosome 14 and OBP32–35 form Cluster 3. Gene
Cluster 4 is divided into two subfamilies: the ABPI subfamily comprising seven members and the ABPII subfamily containing five genes. Two additional ABP family
members are located on another scaffold. OBP20 has a
single exon. In addition, we found the transcription terminating signal (AAACAAAA) in the 3' UTR. Two direct
repeat sequences (TAATGAAATAAAATTA) are present in
the 5'UTR and the 3'UTR. OBP20 may have moved to new
genomic positions by retroposition.
Finally, all members within a subfamily share certain
common intron insertion sites, which differ among subfamilies. The PBP/GOBP subfamily contains two intron
insertion sites which were not found in D. melanogaster, A.
gambiae, A. mellifera and T. castaneum. The ABPI and ABPII
subfamilies have lost the conserved splice sites at S6 and
S2, respectively. In the Minus-C subfamily, Cluster 1 and
OBP28 have only one intron at the N-terminus, whereas
Cluster 2 and OBP29 have additional introns at non-conserved sites. In the Plus-C subfamily, three common
intron insertion sites are located at S1, S3 and S6 sites. In
the CRLBP subfamily, OBP32, OBP35 and OBP36 have
only one single exon each. OBP37 and OBP38 have conserved splice sites.
It is notable that the relatedness of the ABPII and MinusC subfamilies are supported by a better bootstrap value

Alignment of the silkworm OBP-like family members
Alignment of the silkworm OBP-like family members. The signal peptides are boxed. Conserved residues are shown
with a green or light green background. Highly conserved cysteine residues are marked by dark arrowheads. The rectangles
under the alignment represent α-helices identified in BmorPBP1. Vertical bars indicate that the intron occurs between codons.
Backward slanted separators and forward slanted separators point out the splice sites within codons after the first base and
the second base, respectively. Six conservative splice sites are marked by hollow arrowheads.

Phylogenetic comparison of the OBP protein family members in the silkworm
Phylogenetic comparison of the OBP protein family members in the silkworm. An unrooted distance (neighborjoining) tree was constructed using an alignment of the silkworm OBP-like family members after removing the highly divergent
signal peptide sequences at the N-terminus. Bootstrap support (1000 replications) is indicated at the major nodes.
than that for the ABPII and ABPI subfamilies. This interesting feature has also been found in bee and Drosophila.
This suggests that the Minus-C subfamily may be derived
from an ancestor with six conserved cysteines. To better
understand the high degree of OBP sequence divergence,
we analyzed the evolutionary constraints that were acting
on this gene family. The average pairwise ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS) for
sequences in each subfamily was < 1. This indicates that
there is strong negative selection for silkworm OBP genes.
However, we observed that pairwise dN/dS values for several members of the Minus-C family are > 1 (see Additional file 1). This suggests that the members of the
Minus-C subfamily are undergoing positive selection.
We also built a phylogenetic tree based on the alignment
of OBP sequences in five species, B. mori, D. melanogaster,
A. gambiae, T. castaneum and A. mellifera, representing four
orders (Figure 5). The six subfamilies for the silkworm

defined above also form clades. Despite little bootstrap
support for the clade, the Minus-C and ABP subfamilies
are grouped together with OBPs in A. mellifera and T. castaneum. Only a few orthologies could be found among
these five species (e.g., BmorOBP38 having two fly orthologues). The other subfamilies show no obvious relationship across species. This suggests that significant lineagespecific expansion and divergence have occurred in these
insects.
Expression patterns of the silkworm OBP genes
A numbers of EST libraries have been constructed for silkworm and more than 238,000 ESTs are available in GenBank. ESTs corresponding to 24 BmorOBP genes were
identified using tBLASTn with BmorOBP protein
sequences. The coding regions of 16 genes were covered
completely by ESTs (Table 1). ESTs for 17 of the OBP
genes were recovered broadly from chemosensory libraries, including larval maxillary galea, epidermis, brain and

adult antennae. Interestingly, ESTs for seven of the OBP
genes were only found in maxillary galea. OBP23 is
present in silkgland and wing disk besides maxillary galea.
It is noteworthy that OBP23 and OBP11 are highly
expressed in maxillary galea, with 37 and 100 ESTs,
respectively. Three OBP genes (OBP1–3), together with
OBP14, are only observed in the antennal library. OBP27
is present in multiple tissues (silkgland, brain, malpighian
tubule, fat body, midgut, wing disk and testis) as well as
an antennal library. Three genes (OBP27, OBP30 and
OBP31) were found in brain, with OBP31 represented by

two ESTs in the compound eye. In larval epidermis, only
one EST was found for OBP39. Meanwhile, ten
BmorOBPs were recovered from non-chemosensory tissue
libraries, such as silkgland, malpighian tubule, fat body,
midgut, testis, ovary, compound eye, hemocyte, and wing
disk. Most ESTs were also found in the fat body, ovary, testis, silkgland, and wing disk.
We designed and constructed a genome-wide microarray
using 70-mer oligonucleotides based on the draft silkworm genome sequence database. There are four probes,

Expression patterns offifth instar OBPs in multiple tissues of
Expression patterns of silkworm OBPs in multiple
tissues of larvae on day 3 of the fifth instar. The levels
of expression are illustrated by a five grade color scale representing relative expression levels of < 500, 500–1000, 1000–
2000, 2000–6000 and more than 6000.

Our whole-organism array data failed to detect significant
expression levels of 11 of the OBP genes at any time point
in either sex. It is possible that some of these genes are
expressed during these life stages but at levels below the
detection limit. For example OBPs 13, 19 and 27,
although not detected at the whole organism level in fifth
instars, are detected in specific tissues at that life stage.
Three classes of developmental expression profile for 18
members of the silkworm OBP-like family are shown in
Figure 7. Expression of the first class of OBPs was
restricted to adults and pupae near eclosion. A very faint
signal was observed in male moths for OBP14. Three
members of the same gene cluster (OBP1, 2, 3) and
OBP13 were detected at moderate levels in adult. OBP3
was only observed in male. OBP42 was more abundant in
males than females nine days after spinning. OBP30,
OBP32 and OBP36 were detected with weak signals prior
to the emergence and reached the highest level in male
moths.

OBP gene expression in multiple tissues on day 3 of the
fifth instar silkworm is consistent with EST representation
in the database. We found fifteen genes with significant
levels of expression (Figure 6). The expression profiles of
OBP genes differ markedly even among members of the
same gene cluster. The majority of OBPs are expressed in
testis, ovary, brain, epidermis and fat body. Three OBPs
(OBP23, 25 and 31) gave stronger signals in brain and
epidermis than in other tissues. Five genes (OBP1, 2, 13,
19, and 42) are restricted to brain and have low expression
levels. OBP40 and OBP41 share a similar expression pattern in six tissues. However, overall, OBP41 is expressed at
higher levels than is OBP40. OBP43 is expressed at low
levels in testis, ovary, epidermis and fat body, which is a
different pattern than that for OBP42. Sex-biased expression was examined based on two-fold differences in
expression level between the sexes. OBP29, which is
expressed at the highest level in testis and at low levels in
ovary and fat body of males, was the most interesting case.

However, the expression of the majority of OBPs does not
appear to have an obvious sexual bias on day 3 of the fifth
instar.

expression patterns of OBPs were surveyed in multiple
silkworm tissues on day 3 of the fifth instar and also in
whole insects at 15 different time points from day 3 of the
fifth instar larva through to the adult moth. A list of the

in late pupae. OBP40 and OBP41 show three obvious
expression peaks at larva, 60 h after spinning and adult.
The expression of OBP29 in males, which is expressed at
high levels in all lifes stages and reaches the highest level
in adults, also follows this pattern.
Members of the third class of OBPs were expressed in several distinct phases. OBP23 is a good example with expression peaks in the larva, four days after spinning and again
with a weak peak in the adult moth. The expression peaks
of OBP25 are at 0 h, 60 h after spinning and in the adult.
Furthermore, the transcripts were more abundant in
males than in females at the late pupae stages. The highest
expression level of OBP43 was at 12 h and gradually
weakened until 6D after spinning. Only a weak signal was
detected in the adult female. OBP8 shows a weak signal at
several time points. OBP29 expression in females also followed this general pattern with high values 6d and 9d
after spinning. This contrasts with its expression pattern in
males, as described above.
In addition, we determined expression levels of OBP3–6
in moth antennae by QRT-PCR (Figure 8). Consistent
with previous studies [32], BmorOBP3 was predominantly expressed in antennae of male moths. BmorOBP4
was equally expressed in antennae of both sexes. In contrast, BmorOBP5 showed substantially higher expression
in female antennae. BmorOBP6 was marginally more
highly expressed female antennae.

Discussion
We have identified an OBP gene family comprising 44
members in the silkworm. This number is comparable to
that in D. melanogaster and more than twice that in A. mellifera. Previously, eighteen chemosensory proteins (CSPs)
have been identified in the silkworm genome [34].

Female Antennae

Although there is no conclusive experimental support for
olfactory functions, it was suggested that the CSPs may be
a second class of OBPs. Moderate numbers of olfactory
and gustatory receptors have been reported in the silkworm genome [35-37]. Recent evidence has demonstrated that OBPs are required for recognition of odorants
or pheromones in a number of species [9-17]. The silkworm OBPs could play a chemosensory role in chemoreception by a combinatorial interaction with
chemoreceptors.
Our phylogenetic analysis revealed that the silkworm OBP
family comprises six subfamilies. Evidence of significant
expansion of, and divergence among, OBP subfamilies
indicates that the OBP family has undergone rapid evolution following a complex set of gene duplication events.
This may have been required to enhance the ability to
detect diverse sets of odorants. For example, silkworms at
the larval stage can accurately distinguish volatile compounds and tastants released from mulberry leaves and
other plants. The Plus-C OBP genes have only been found
in silkworm, flies, and mosquitoes; therefore, we conclude that these genes arose after the separation of the
Mecopteria. The honey bee possesses the smallest OBP
repertoire. The silkworm ABP and Minus-C subfamilies
share a high degree of sequence similarity to their homologues in honey bee. The divergence of the OBP families
between silkworm and bee might be due to differences in
their social organization, foraging behaviour and life
cycles. Both species find food resources using plant volatiles, however, the range of food sources exploited by the
honey bee and the sophistication of its chemical communication is substantially greater than for the silkworm.
OBP subfamilies that are common to both species may be
required for detection of similar odorants, such as plant
volatiles. The silkworm-specific OBP subfamily may be
important for oviposition, mate finding and so on. For
example, the PBP\GOBP subfamily forms a monophyletic
group specific for Lepidoptera.

column represent SD for three independent experiments.

The diversity of the OBP gene family suggests a role for
positive selection in the rapid evolution and functional
diversification of these genes. We found evidence for positive selection in the Minus-C OBP subfamily. Nevertheless, the relatively low dN/dS value in other OBP
subfamilies suggests a purifying selection due to functional constraints. This conclusion is consistent with that
obtained by investigating nucleotide variation in two
OBPs (OS-E and OS-F) and comparative analysis of the
OBP family in 12 Drosophila genomes [38-40]. Subfamily
members arising by duplication may acquire subtle functional differences. Nevertheless, small changes in
sequence may have profound functional consequences
[41]. Moreover, the diversity of expression patterns and
their expression as heterodimers or homodimers increase
the potential function of the OBP family. Several studies
Page 10 of 14
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:332

have demonstrated that some OBPs might form
homodimers or heterodimers [7,42-48].
The expression profiles of silkworm OBP genes have been
characterized for both sexes and several tissues and a
number of developmental stages. One group of OBP
genes is expressed only in olfactory tissues, whereas others
are expressed more broadly, including in tissues with no
known olfactory function. The majority of members in
the same subfamily show a similar expression pattern. In
this study, we found that only members of the PBP/GOBP
subfamily are antenna-specific. OBP1 and OBP2 were
found to be expressed at approximately equal levels in the
antennae of female and male moths by Northern blot
[32]. The well characterized BmorPBP1 is predominantly
expressed in the antennae of male moths. In vitro studies
demonstrated that PBP1 could selectively bind the pheromone component bombykol [8,9]. The presence of four
candidate BmorPBPs in the silkworm genome offers the
possibility of selective transport of the three female pheromone components to receptor neurons [49,50]. This
hypothesis is supported by binding studies with two PBPs
from olfactory sensilla of the silkmoth species, Antheraea
polyphemus and Antheraea pernyi [51]. Female moths
release bombykal to repel potential mates. Based on the
sequence conservation of the PBP gene family and the
uniqueness of the PBP lineage in Lepidoptera, we speculate that BmorOBP4–6 may be candidate binding proteins
for bombykal. In contrast to BmorOBP3, BmorOBP5 and
BmorOBP6 seem to be expressed at higher levels in female
moths. The two OBPs may bind other odors, including
oviposition cues or as yet uncharacterized odors that may
be released by male moths [52].
Another typical class of OBP is the ABP subfamily, most
members of which are expressed specifically in chemosensory organs. Intriguingly, we found that OBP8–12 are
expressed in larval maxillary galea which contains taste
sensilla. Some Drosophila OBP genes are expressed in both
olfactory and gustatory tissues and some are exclusively
expressed in gustatory organs [18,53]. For example, Drosophila OBP57d and OBP57e are involved in taste perception and the response to toxins demonstrating that OBPs
are important for gustation [15]. The ABPI subfamily in
silkworm might be involved in the perception of the taste
of mulberry leaves.
Several members of the Minus-C and Plus-C subfamilies
are expressed in multiple tissues, including several nonchemosensory organs, such as fat body, testis, and ovary.
Most of these are detectable throughout development and
show three obvious peaks of expression. The expression
patterns characteristic of this OBP subfamily are similar to
those of the CSP family in silkworm and in other species.
Although pupae are dormant, the transformation from

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/332

larva to moth involves profound metabolic changes. Larval organs and appendages are digested internally and
replaced by adult structures. The fat body supplies considerable energy for this metamorphosis. We hypothesize
that some members of the OBP and CSP families may play
general physiological roles as carriers or may mediate
responses to ligands that are important for metamorphosis and development.
The silkworm OBP will assist the identification of OBPs
from other insect species by similarity screening, especially in the Lepidoptera. The comparison of OBP families
across many different insect species may shed light on
evolutionary divergence among OBPs and on insect
chemosensory mechanisms of host and environmental
adaptation.

Conclusion
44 OBPs have been identified in the genome of the silkworm. These may represent the entire repertoire of silkworm OBPs. Modest numbers of OBPs might interact
with chemoreceptors to enhance the capabilities of chemoreception. The remarkable sequence divergence and subfamily expansion suggests that silkworm OBP family
members bind to diverse sets of odorants. The family
shows evidence of purifying selection, likely due to functional constraints. The expression profile of the OBP family suggests that these proteins might be involved in
olfaction and gustation, as well as having general transport roles in non-chemosensory tissues.

Methods
Identification of the silkworm OBP family members
Known insect OBP sequences were downloaded from
GenBank [19,22,23,54]. These insect OBP sequences were
used to search for similar genes in the silkworm genome
sequence with TBLASTN [55,56]. Silkworm genomic
regions containing OBP genes were predicted using
FGENESH+ [57]. Gene prediction was revised by comparing with the EST database. Candidate OBP genes were
checked for three universal features of the insect OBP family: a conserved cysteine pattern, a predicted size (~14
kDa), and a signal sequence predicted by SignalP [58].
Nomenclature of the silkworm OBPs
We adopted nomenclature for silkworm OBPs that is analogous to those proposed for the Anopheles OBP and the
honey bee OBPs [22,23]. We use the prefix BmorOBP to
reflect that the gene is a putative member belonging to the
silkworm Odorant Binding Protein-like family. The previously published silkworm general binding protein (BmorGOBP) has been renamed BmorOBP1. OBP genes
organized into a cluster were given consecutive numbers.
The classical OBP members are listed prior to the atypical
members (Table 1).

Phylogenetic analysis
The forty-four conceptually translated protein sequences
from silkworm OBP genes identified in this study, along
with the OBPs from four other insect species (D. melanogaster, A. gambiae, A. mellifera and T. castaneum), were
used to construct a phylogenetic tree. Sequences were
aligned using ClustalX [59]. The α-helices identified in
BmorPBP1 were indicated under the alignment [60]. The
highly divergent signal peptide sequences at the N-terminus were truncated. Neighbor-joining trees were produced
using the Phylip package [61]. Bootstrap analysis was performed using 1000 neighbor-joining replicates. The tree
was displayed using MEGA4 [62]. All pairwise dn/ds values were calculated using the program KaKs_Calculator.
The program adopts model selection and model averaging
to calculate nonsynonymous (Ka) and synonymous (Ks)
substitution rates [63]. In addition, several existing methods (NG, LWL, LPB, MLWL, MLPB, YN, MYN, and GY) for
calculating Ka and Ks are also incorporated into
KaKs_Calculator. Fisher's exact test for small samples was
applied to justify the validity of Ka and Ks calculated.
Sample preparation
The silkworm strain Dazao was reared on mulberry leaves
and pupae were maintained at room temperature until
eclosion. For the silkworm genome-wide oligonucleotide
microarray, the anterior/median silk gland (A/MSG), posterior silk gland (PSG), testis, ovary, fat body, midgut,
integument, hemocyte, malpighian tubule, and head on
day 3 of the fifth instar were hand-dissected on ice. We
also collected individuals at 15 different time points from
day 3 of the fifth instar to moth. Moth antennae, heads,
thoraces, abdomens, legs, wings were dissected and all tissues were immediately frozen with liquid nitrogen and
stored at -70°C until use.

used a dual-dye experiment to analyze the expression patterns and each experiment was performed as a dye-swap.
In pilot experiments, we performed several self-to-self
hybridizations to evaluate system noise. All arrays were
scanned with a confocal LuxScan™ scanner and the images
obtained were analyzed using LuxScan™ 3.0 software
(CapitalBio Corporation, Beijing, China). For the individual channel data extracts, we removed any faint spots
from both channels (Cy3 and Cy5), whose signal intensities were below 400 units after subtracting the background. The linear normalization method was used to
normalize individual channel data, based on the expression levels of four confirmed housekeeping genes. The
normalized signal intensity values were further analyzed
using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), with the significance level set at a P value of less than 0.001 (P <
0.001) across all investigated tissues. We visualized the
cluster data using the Treeview program [66].
QRT-PCR analysis
Total RNA was isolated from adult tissues using Trizol
Reagent (Invitrogen). First-strand cDNA was synthesized
using the superscript first-strand synthesis system for RTPCR (Invitrogen). Gene-specific primers for RT-PCR were
synthesized commercially and silkworm actin3 was used
as an internal control. For OBP3, OBP4, OBP5 and OBP6,
the QRT-PCR reactions were performed using an ABI
PRISM™ 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) and SYBR Green I (SYBR® Premix Ex Taq™,
TaKaRa). The PCR cycles were as follows: a 10 min denaturation at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles with 5s at 95°C
and 30s at 60°C. The expression levels of the PBP candidate genes were calculated relative to the control gene
BmActin3 according to Livak & Schmittgen [67].

Authors' contributions
Microarray analysis
A genome-wide microarray with 22,987 70-mer oligonucleotides was designed and constructed by Southwest University (Chongqing, China) and CapitalBio Corporation
(Beijing, China) [64]. Briefly, the 70-mer probes representing 21,375 predicted genes from the silkworm WGS
and 1,612 ESTs of interest that were not contained in the
predicted genes were synthesized by MWG-Biotech Inc
(Ebersberg, Germany). Arrays were fabricated using a
SmartArrayer™ (CapitalBio Corporation, Beijing, China).
cDNA labeled with fluorescent dye (Cy5 and Cy3-dCTP)
was produced by the linear RNA amplification method
[65]. The resulting labeled cDNAs were denatured in
hybridization solution (3×SSC, 0.2% SDS, 5×Denhardt's
solution and 25% formamide) at 95°C for 3 min before
hybridization. Hybridizations were performed in a
hybridization chamber which was placed in a three-phase
tilting agitator (BioMixer™; CapitalBio). After hybridization, slides were washed twice with washing solution. We
