Organization and molecular evolution of a
disease-resistance gene cluster in coffee trees

Abstract
Background: Most disease-resistance (R) genes in plants encode NBS-LRR proteins and belong to one of the
largest and most variable gene families among plant genomes. However, the specific evolutionary routes of NBSLRR encoding genes remain elusive. Recently in coffee tree (Coffea arabica), a region spanning the SH3 locus that
confers resistance to coffee leaf rust, one of the most serious coffee diseases, was identified and characterized.
Using comparative sequence analysis, the purpose of the present study was to gain insight into the genomic
organization and evolution of the SH3 locus.
Results: Sequence analysis of the SH3 region in three coffee genomes, Ea and Ca subgenomes from the
allotetraploid C. arabica and Cc genome from the diploid C. canephora, revealed the presence of 5, 3 and 4 R
genes in Ea, Ca, and Cc genomes, respectively. All these R-gene sequences appeared to be members of a CC-NBSLRR (CNL) gene family that was only found at the SH3 locus in C. arabica. Furthermore, while homologs were
found in several dicot species, comparative genomic analysis failed to find any CNL R-gene in the orthologous
regions of other eudicot species. The orthology relationship among the SH3-CNL copies in the three analyzed
genomes was determined and the duplication/deletion events that shaped the SH3 locus were traced back. Gene
conversion events were detected between paralogs in all three genomes and also between the two sub-genomes
of C. arabica. Significant positive selection was detected in the solvent-exposed residues of the SH3-CNL copies.
Conclusion: The ancestral SH3-CNL copy was inserted in the SH3 locus after the divergence between Solanales and
Rubiales lineages. Moreover, the origin of most of the SH3-CNL copies predates the divergence between Coffea
species. The SH3-CNL family appeared to evolve following the birth-and-death model, since duplications and
deletions were inferred in the evolution of the SH3 locus. Gene conversion between paralog members, intersubgenome sequence exchanges and positive selection appear to be the major forces acting on the evolution of
SH3-CNL in coffee trees.

Background
In their natural environment, plants encounter a vast array
of pathogenic microorganisms such as viruses, bacteria,
oomycetes, fungi and nematodes. To defend themselves
against infection by these pathogens, plants employ a network of intertwined mechanisms. One such line of defense
is based on dominant disease resistance (R) genes that
mediate resistance to pathogens possessing corresponding
avirulence (Avr) genes [1]. The largest class of known R
genes includes those that encode the nucleotide binding
site (NBS) and the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains. The

deduced NBS-LRR proteins can be subdivided in classes
based on their amino-terminal features [2,3]. The most
frequent classes possess a TIR domain with similarity to
either the intracellular signaling domains of Drosophila
Toll and the mammalian Interleukin-1 Receptor or a CC
domain (coiled-coil) in the N-terminal and are named
TNL (TIR-NBS-LRR) and CNL (CC-NBS-LRR), respectively [1,3,4]. Each domain of NBS-LRR protein is predicted to have a specific function. The NBS domain is
suggested to have NTP-hydrolyzing activity (ATPase or
GTPase, etc), regulating signal transduction through conformational changes [4,5]. The LRR domain contains tandemly arrayed repeats in the carboxy-terminal region of
R-genes and its predicted biochemical function is to mediate protein-protein interaction. It was hypothesized and

experimentally confirmed that the LRR domain is involved
in the specific recognition of pathogen effectors [6-9].
Both TIR and CC domains are assumed to be involved in
protein-protein interactions and signal transduction
[10,11].
Genes encoding NBS-LRR protein represent one of
the largest and most variable gene families found in
plants, with most plant genomes containing several hundred family members. NBS-LRR genes are unevenly distributed in plant genomes and are mainly organized in
multi-gene clusters [2,12-16]. Furthermore, results of
nucleotide polymorphism analyses demonstrated extremely high levels of inter and intraspecific variation of
NBS-LRR genes, which presumably evolved rapidly in
response to changes in pathogen populations [16-18].
The clustered distribution of R-genes is assumed to provide a reservoir of genetic variation from which new
pathogen specificity can evolve via gene duplication,
unequal crossing-over, ectopic recombination or diversifying selection [19]. However, the specific evolutionary
routes of NBS-LRR encoding genes remain elusive. Several comparative sequence analyses of R-gene clusters
have been performed across haplotypes or related genomes in different plant species including Arabidopsis
[20,21], wild potato [22], tomato [23-25], Brassicaceae
[26], wheat [27], rice [28] soybean [29] and common
bean [30]. Available data suggest that different R genes
can follow strikingly different evolutionary trajectories.
Kuang et al. [31,32] divided NBS-LRR-genes into two
evolutionary categories: Type I includes genes whose
evolution is accelerated by frequent sequence exchange
among paralogs. Consequently, their sequences have
chimeric structure and a clear allelic/orthologous relationship between different genotypes cannot be easily
established. Type II includes slowly evolving genes
whose sequence mainly evolves through the accumulation of amino acid substitution. Orthology relationships
are highly conserved among accessions [33].
The evolutionary rate of each domain of individual NBSLRR-encoding genes has been shown to be heterogeneous
[31]. The NBS domain appears to be subject to purifying
selection, whereas the LRR region tends to be highly variable [34]. Nucleotide polymorphisms found in the LRR
region of R genes have been shown to be responsible for
pathogen specificity [8]. In particular, codons encoding
putative solvent-exposed residues in the LRR domain are
hypervariable among different R proteins and show significantly elevated ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous
substitutions, suggesting that the LRR domain is subject to
positive selection for amino acid diversification [19,35-39].
Coffee is one of the world’s most important agricultural commodities and is the main livelihood of more
than 80 million people worldwide. Although the Coffea

Page 2 of 12

subgenus Coffea includes more than 95 species [40],
commercial coffee production relies mainly on two
related species: Coffea arabica L. and C. canephora
Pierre, which account for 65% and 35% of world coffee
production, respectively (International Coffee Organization, http://www.ico.org). C. arabica L. (2n = 4x = 44),
the only polyploid species in the Coffea genus, is an allotetraploid containing two diploid subgenomes, Ca and
Ea, which originated from two different diploid species
(2n = 2x = 22), C. canephora and C. eugenioides, respectively [41]. While diversification in the Coffea subgenus
Coffea probably occurred in the second half of the Middle Pleistocene (450,000-100,000 years BP), it is most
likely that the allopolyploid speciation of C. arabica
took place in relatively recent times i.e. from historical
times to 50,000 years ago [41,42].
Among the diseases affecting cultivated coffee, coffee
leaf rust, caused by the obligate parasitic fungus Hemileia
vastatrix Berk. & Br. (Uredinales), is one of the most serious diseases and greatly limits Arabica coffee production
in almost all coffee growing countries around the world.
Therefore, the development of coffee varieties resistant to
coffee leaf rust has been a breeding objective of the highest
priority in many countries [43]. A number of resistance
genes to coffee leaf rust have been identified in the cultivated or wild Coffea gene pool. In particular, one resistance gene (i.e. SH3 resistance factor) has been successfully
introgressed from C. liberica into agronomically important
Arabica cultivars. In the last few years, the genetic and
physical maps of the SH3 locus were completed [44-46].
Furthermore, using fluorescence in situ hybridization in C.
arabica, the SH3 locus was located in a distal position on a
chromosome belonging to the homeologous group 1 [47].
Recently, a region of 800 kb spanning the SH3 locus was
sequenced and annotated [48]. Tandem arrays of CNL R
genes were identified suggesting that the SH3 locus corresponds to a complex multi-gene cluster.
The purpose of the present study was to gain insight
into the genomic organization and evolution of the SH3
R gene cluster in coffee. The agronomic importance of
this locus as well as the recent origin and the perennial
characteristic of coffee species make these objectives
especially appealing. Sequences of the S H 3 region in
three different genomes, the Ca and Ea subgenomes of
C. arabica and the C c genome of C. canephora were
analyzed to investigate the genomic organization and
evolution of the SH3 locus. In addition, we performed
comparative analyses of the identified NBS-LRR encoding sequences to identify the forces that drive evolution
in the S H 3 R gene cluster. Our results highlight the
importance of intra and inter subgenomic gene conversion as an important evolutionary mechanism for the
evolution of disease resistance genes.

Results
Organization of the SH3 R gene cluster

The sequences of a total of 13 BAC clones spanning the
SH3 locus (Figure 1) in three coffee genomes (i.e. Ea and
C a sub-genome from C. arabica and Cc from C. canephora), were examined for the presence of R-genes using
the previously determined annotation [48]. Depending on
the genome concerned (Ea, Ca, Cc), a total of 5, 3 and 4 Rgenes were identified, respectively. These sequences shared
more than 95% of identity. According to Chen et al. [49], a
R gene family is defined when 60% identity is shared by
members. The R-gene sequences detected in SH3 were
therefore further considered as members of a unique Rgene coffee family. BLAST analysis of the non-redundant
database (All non-redundant GenBank CDS translations +
RefSeq Proteins + PDB + SwissProt + PIR + PRF) revealed
high similarity with several R-genes belonging to the CNL
class. While the highest identity was observed with the
hypothetical CNL R protein in Vitis vinifera (36% identity)
in Ricinus communis and Glycine max (35%), the most
similar functionally characterized protein was the RPP8
gene from Arabidopsis thaliana that confers resistance to
Peronospora parasitica [36] and shares 32% of identity and
more than 50% of similarity. Among the species belonging
to the subclass Asteridae, which includes Coffea, several
proteins where found in Solanum spp. which show 30% of
identity and 50% of similarity with the R-gene family
found at the SH3 locus of Coffea.
The CNL-like sequences identified in the SH3 R-gene
cluster were distributed in two regions separated by more
than 160 kb (Figure 2). In the first region (hereafter
called region A) two or three copies were found in the
same orientation. The other region (B) contained 1 or 2
copies repeated in tandem. Region A and B had opposing
coding orientations. Orthology relationship among Rgenes was established by comparing flanking sequences
and each member was identified by the group letter followed by a number. A homeologous non-reciprocal
transposition event (HNRT) occurred between the two
genomes of C. arabica and involved a region of around

50 kb that includes the A1 and A2 members (unpublished data).
To test for the presence of a possible additional copy of
the SH3-CNL in the Arabica coffee genome, Southern blot
analysis was performed using a specific probe corresponding to a conserved part of the NBS region (Figure 3).
Whatever the restriction enzyme used, only a limited
number of hybridization bands was detected. Based on the
restriction profiles predicted from sequence analysis of C.
arabica cv. IAPAR-59 BAC, it was possible to assign all
the bands to one of the eight members (five in the Ea genome and three in the Ca genome) present at the SH3 locus.
No additional band was detected, suggesting that this
family is only present at the SH3 locus in C. arabica cv.
IAPAR-59. In fact, even if it is possible that additional
hybridization fragments have size out of the detectable
range, this should happened for all the three restriction
enzymes and can be considered as a very improbable
event.
The presence and number of members of this gene
family in a panel of diploid coffee species were investigated by Southern blot analysis (Figure 4). While the
S H 3-CNL family was always present, the number of
members ranged from three to eight depending on the
species. Intra-specific variability was also observed for
different accessions of C. canephora and C. eugenioides.
Origin and evolution of the SH3 R gene cluster

To investigate the origin of the SH3-CNL genes present at
locus SH3 we performed comparative analysis of the available sequences of three Coffea genomes and among the
SH3-CNL copies including their flanking regions. Since
members of the SH3-CNL family were found to be collinear in the comparisons of the three Coffea genomes
(Figure 5A), we concluded that the observed organization
of this locus predates the divergence between C. eugenioides and C. canephora lineages. The most parsimonious

scenario for the evolution of this locus is illustrated in

shaped region A, whereas a distant duplication/insertion

Locus SH3 was compared with the putative orthologous region in the tomato genome (Solanum lycopersicum) which is, to date, the closest species to Coffea for
which whole genome sequence is available (http://solgenomics.net). Micro-synteny was found between the coffee SH3 locus and two tomato genomic regions which
shared 53.2 and 23.4% of the Coffea genes, respectively
(data not shown), but no CNL genes were found in
these regions of the tomato genome.

The coding sequence of all SH3-CNL members is composed of two exons separated by an intron ranging
from 157 to 272 nucleotides in length. The first exon
spanned 1042 nt while the second exon extended from
1703 to 2003 nt (Table 1). The protein sequence
extended from 915 to 1015 aa (Table 1). The protein
sequence alignment of the identified 12 SH3-CNL members (eight from C. arabica and four from C. canephora) is shown in figure 6. S H 3-CNL_A2_C a was
chosen as query to annotate protein domains. BLASTp
analysis against the Pfam database predicted a NBS
domain between positions 173 and 465 aa, while analysis of the Conserved Domain Database predicted the
beginning of the LRR region at position 625 aa of the
query protein. COILS analysis revealed a coiled-coil
region located between position 17 and 56 aa, confirming that this family belongs to the CC sub-family of
NBS-LRR genes (or non-TIR sub-family). The LRR
region of all genes consists of 12 repeats ranging from
23 to 31 aa. These repeats are sufficiently different to
ensure an unambiguous alignment of amino-acid
sequences. A 8 bp deletions modified the reading frame
of B2_E a and induced an early stop codon after the
10th LRR; similarly, an 1 bp insertion in the A2_E a
made this member a pseudogene. Both INDEL modifying the reading frame were disregarded in figure 6 and
in the following analyses.

To study interspecific diversity, the SH3-CNL_A2 member was selected at random for further analysis. The
SH3-CNL_A2 member was cloned from six coffee species (C. anthonyi, C sp. Congo, C. canephora, C. eugenioides, C. liberica, C. pseudozanguebarie). The cloned
fragments were around 4 kb in size. Their sequences
were determined and compared with those from Ca, Ea
and Cc genomes.

Sequence diversity analysis of the SH3-CNL family

Using the RDP3 software [50] and regardless of the
method used for the analysis, significant traces of gene
conversion were detected among the member of the
SH3-CNL family, both in C. arabica and C. canephora.
As an example, the conversions detected with the RDP

method were reported in Table 2. Among the nine different gene conversions detected, two events involved
inter subgenomic exchanges.
The DNA sp program (v.5) was used to estimate polymorphism among the four S H 3-CNL members in the
genome of C. canephora species (Cc). The highest level

(π = 0.17, 0.20 and 0.15) while the most conserved

To check the type of selection that acted on genes in
the SH3-CNL family, the ratio between non-synonymous
(Ka) and synonymous substitutions (Ks) was estimated
using DNAsp v.5. The Ka/Ks substitution rate was calculated for each pair between ortholog and/or paralog
members in C. arabica and C. canephora species. We
also calculated the Ka/Ks between each pair of A2
members cloned from diploid coffee species together
with A2 members from sequenced genomes (C. arabica
and C. canephora). The analysis was performed on the
complete coding sequence as well as on different
domains (CC, NBS, LRR). Analysis also focused on

Figure 7 Nucleotide diversity among SH3-CNL members from
C. canephora. Nucleotide diversity (Pi) is the average number of
nucleotide differences per site between two sequences calculated
by DnaSP v.5. Nucleotide diversity was calculated using the sliding
window method where a window (segment of DNA) is moved
along the sequences step by step. The parameter is calculated in
each window, and the value is assigned to the nucleotide at the
midpoint of the window. Both the default values were used:
window length of 100 sites, and step size of 25 sites (midpoint). The
alignment gaps were not counted in the window length (or slide).

Strong evidence for positive selection (Ka/Ks > 1) was
observed only for residues in xxLxLxx motifs. Among
the 66 pair combinations between 12 BAC derived Rgenes, 19, of which 16 involving B members, appeared
under positive selection (Figure 8). When the same
region was analyzed among orthologous A2 members,
no significant Ka/Ks > 1 was found..

Discussion
Organization and evolution of the SH3-CNL family

Comparative analyses of R-gene clusters across different
haplotypes or species demonstrated that the evolution of
resistant genes is a dynamic process mostly involving
duplication, deletion, sequence exchange, point mutation,
diversified selection, recombination, gene conversion and
retroelement insertion [21,23,24,28-30,32,33,51,52]. The
cluster arrangement of R-genes represents an important
reservoir of diversity and a source of genetic variation
allowing the generation of novel resistance specificities
via gene conversion, gene duplication, unequal crossingover, ectopic recombination or diversifying selection
[12,19]. To explore the organization and to characterize
the mechanisms involved in the evolution of the S H 3
locus, where a putative R-gene cluster was identified [48]
a ~550 kb sequence was analyzed in three coffee genomes, Ea and Ca from C. arabica and Cc from C. canephora. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of a
variable number of NBS-LRR genes belonging to the CC
subclass at the SH3 locus. All these genes belong to the
same family (hereafter called SH3-CNL family). Sequence
analysis of regions flanking the SH3-CNL genes helped
determine the orthology relationship among the copies in
different genomes. At the same time, several traces of
ancient duplications made it possible to trace back the
duplication/deletion events which, consistently with the
birth and death evolution model, shaped the SH3 locus
from the most recent common ancestor of all SH3-CNL

copies. Since the structure of the SH3 locus was well conserved in all three Coffea genomes analyzed, one can conclude that the origin of most of the S H 3-CNL copies
predates the divergence between Coffea species.
Homologs of SH 3-CNL genes were found in several
dicot species including Solanum spp., but comparative
genomics failed to find a CNL R-gene in the orthologous regions of three Rosid species [48] and Solanum
lycopersicum. Consequently, it can be suggested that the
ancestral SH3-CNL copy was inserted in the SH3 locus
after the divergence between Solanum and Coffea
lineages.
In a similar study by David et al. [30] the authors compared the B4 locus of Phaseolus vulgaris (that has 26 CNL
genes) with three sequenced legume genomes, Medicago
trunculata (Mt), Lotus japonicus (Lj) and Glycine max
(Gm). Their analysis revealed that conserved microsynteny
existed among legumes species, except for the CNL
sequences, which appeared to be completely absent in the
corresponding regions of Mt and Lj and only a truncated
CNL was found in syntenic regions of Gm [30]. They suggested that CNL were inserted in the ancestor of the B4
locus after Mt, Lj, and Pv diverged but before the divergence of Pv and Gm through an ectopic recombination
event between non-homologous chromosomes. Phylogenetic analysis including those legume CNL sequences and
all known Pv B4-CNL sequences supported this hypothesis
[30].
Structural instability induced by repetitive mobile elements is one of the mechanisms that could lead to diversification into R gene families. The presence of very
similar sequences increases the possibilities of mispairing
during recombination, giving rise to unequal crossovers
and interlocus gene conversions [19,53-55]. However, the
edges of the duplications involved in the birth of new
SH3-CNL copies were not related to mobile elements and
mobile elements identified in the region did not appear

to play a role in the structural evolution of the SH3 locus
of Coffea species.
Gene conversion (i.e. the substitution of a portion of a
gene sequence by the homologous sequence of another
related gene) is more frequent among members of highly
similar, tightly clustered families [56]. Gene conversion is
a common phenomenon and it has been detected
between paralogs in many R-gene clusters [9,21,35-37,
57-62]. Sequence exchanges between different sub-genomes have previously been detected in a R1 resistancegene cluster of one CNL subfamily in allohexaploid, Solanum demissum [22]. In that study, seven of the 17
sequence exchanges among R1 homologs occurred
between different genomes. Two explanations were proposed: first, sequence exchanges among different haplotypes could be generated through gene conversions or
alternatively, they might have occurred through recombination before speciation and have been conserved in
S. demissum [22]. At the S H 3 locus, gene conversion
events were detected between paralogs in all three coffee
genomes analyzed and also between members of the two
sub-genomes of C. arabica.
Conversion events were detected between S H 3-CNL
members independently of their orientation (i.e. between
members in region A and B).The inverted orientation of
the loci might allow rare interlocus gene conversion or
unequal exchange while minimizing the risk of gross chromosomal rearrangement [23]. The gene orientation in a
cluster of NBS-LRR has also been studied in rice [12] and
A. thaliana [56]. These studies demonstrated that conversion can occur between genes in the same or in opposite
orientation, however conversion is more frequent in gene
families arranged as direct repeats because they have
higher similarity than those found in opposite orientation.
In addition, gene conversion was suggested to be
more frequent in perennial than in annual plants. Yang
et al.[18], compared the gene conversion events among

NBS-encoding genes in two perennial and two annual
plants. A total of 823 and 468 gene conversion events
involving 299 and 187 NBS-encoding genes were
detected in grapevine and poplar, respectively, while
only 143 and 81 gene conversion events were detected
in Arabidopsis and rice, respectively [18]. Since the
long-generation time of woody species slows down the
accumulation of evolutionary change, the authors suggested that an excess of recent duplications and a
higher conversion rate in grapevine and poplar could
generate novel resistance profiles to compensate for life
history traits. According to Kuang et al. [31,32]S H 3CNL members should be classified as evolutionary type
I (fast evolving genes) since several conversion events
were detected between members.

found in the leucine-rich (LRR) region of R genes are
often responsible for pathogen specificity [66].
In the SH3-CNL family, significant positive selection
was only detected when the Ka/Ks analysis was focused
on solvent-exposed residues (i.e. the x residues in
xxLxLxx motif from LRR domain) most frequently
among paralog members. Conversely, when larger
regions were considered, the effect of natural selection
was diluted and not detectable.
In the co-evolutionary arms race between hosts and
their pathogens, genes involved in their interaction are
expected to evolve under positive selection. The positive
selection detected in the solvent-exposed residue of the
SH3-CNL members could indicate involvement in recognition of pathogen attack.

Effect of selection on molecular evolution of the SH3-CNL
family

Conclusions
The SH3-CNL family appears to have evolved following
the birth-and-death model, since duplications and deletions were inferred in the evolution of the SH 3 locus.
Gene conversion between paralog members from the
same or different sub-genomes, and positive selection
appear to be the major forces influencing the evolution
of SH3-CNL in coffee trees.

Natural selection influences the molecular evolution of
sequences by increasing or reducing the fixation probability of a given mutation which, respectively, increases
or reduces the fitness of the individuals carrying it.
The effect of natural selection on a gene sequence can
be investigated by analyzing nucleotide substitutions that
occurred between two variants of this gene. Since synonymous substitutions (i.e. nucleotide substitutions that do
not change the amino acid sequence) are supposed to
not modify the phenotype, their accumulation is considered not to be influenced by natural selection. Conversely, non-synonymous substitutions (nucleotide
substitutions that modify the coded amino acid) could
increase, reduce, or not influence the fitness of the individuals carrying it; consequently, their accumulation could
be influenced by natural selection. The ratio of nonsynonymous (Ka) to synonymous (Ks) substitution rates
could be used to infer the effect of natural selection of a
given gene or a part of it. When Ka and Ks have similar
values (Ka/Ks ≈ 1), one could infer a neutral effect of
selection; when Ka is significantly lower than Ks (0 < Ka/
Ks < 1), it could be deduced that the selection purges the
gene sequence of most non-synonymous substitutions
(purifying selection); finally, when Ka is significantly
higher than Ks (Ka/Ks > 1), the selection is assumed to
favor fixation of new variants (positive or diversifying
selection) [63,64].
In many NBS-LRR genes, analysis of corresponding
proteins revealed high non-synonymous:synonymous
substitution ratios in the leucine-rich (LRR) domain,
mainly concentrated on the putative solvent-exposed
residues, indicating that the LRR domain is subject to
positive selection for amino acid diversification,
[19,35,36,38,39,59,60,65-68]. These results are consistent
with the observation that nucleotide polymorphisms

Materials and methods
Plant material and DNA extraction

The cv. IAPAR 59 of Coffea arabica and six Coffea species were analyzed in this study: C. canephora (IF200),
C. anthonyi (OD68), C sp. Congo (OB66), C. eugenioides
(DA54), C. liberica (EA67), C. pseudozanguebarie (H66).
Genomic DNA was isolated from leaves of greenhouse
grown plants located at IRD (Institut de Recherche pour
le Développement) Montpellier, France. Leaves were frozen in liquid nitrogen and DNA was extracted using a
CTAB procedure [69] with modified extraction buffer
(3% CTAB, 1.4 mM NACl, 100 mM Tris HCl, 20 mM
EDTA, pH 0.8).
BAC sequences

Several Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) clones
spanning the SH3 locus were isolated from a C. arabica
(IAPAR59) [70] and a C. canephora (HD-200-94) (unpublished data) libraries Based on fingerprint data and overlapping sequence analysis, BAC sequences were assembled
in contigs specific to the C. arabica and C. canephora genomes (hereafter called Cc for C. canephora genome; Ea and
Ca for “eugenioides” and “canephora” sub-genomes of C.
arabica) (Lashermes et al. 2010). Gene annotation of the
BACs was already available [48]. Sequences of the thirteen
selected BACs were deposited to GeneBank [accession
numbers, Genebank:GU123894 to GU123899 and
HQ696507 to HQ696513].

Primer design and cloning procedure

Southern blot analysis

Orthologous specific primers to amplify A2 members of
the S H 3-CNL family from wild Coffea species were
designed based on sequence alignments of A2 members in
C. canephora and C. arabica: A2_Left: 5’-CCTTGATAAGAAACATGAATGAAATACACGA-3’ and A2_right 5’AAGGATAAATGAGAAGAACTACTGAGCCTG-3’.
DNA amplification was performed with Expand™
20Kbplus PCR System (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim
Germany). PCR were performed as follows: one cycle of
1 min at 95°C, 10 cycles of 10 sec at 94°C, 45 sec at 50°C,
5 min at 68°C followed by 20 cycles of 10 sec at 94°C,
45 sec at 50°C, 7 min at 68°C plus 10 sec per cycle, and
final extension of 7 min at 68°C. A10 μl aliquot from each
PCR amplification was analyzed by electrophoresis in a
1.2% agarose gel. The amplicons were gel-stained using
Crystal violet and the DNA bands were purified using a S.
N.A. P™ purification column (Invitrogen Carlsbad, CA).
The PCR products were cloned into the pCR® -XLTOPO® kit from Invitrogen and chemically competent
cells (Invitrogen Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Eight colonies were randomly selected for
screening. Colony PCR of eight random samples was used
to select clones containing the complete amplicon. For
this purpose, two new primers were designed to amplify
the extremities of the genes in combination with the primers used to amplify the whole gene: 5’-CGACAGTGGGAACGAAACCC-3’combined with A2_Left and 5’TGGAGGACCGGATCATGAACA-3’ combined with de
A2_RIGHT. The colony PCR was performed as follows:
10 min at 94°C, followed by 30 cycles of 30 sec at 94°C,
30 sec at 55°C, 4 min at 72°C and final extension
of 10 min at 72°C. The colonies shown to contain the
complete insert were transferred to 5 ml LB broth with
50 μg/ml kanamycin and incubated at 37°C overnight.
Plasmid DNA was isolated using Promega Wizard® Plus
Minipreps DNA purification System (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA) according to manufacturer’s
instructions. Two independent PCR and sequencing were
carried out to ensure quality.

Southern blot analysis was performed as follows: 20 μg
of genomic DNA was extracted as described above and
digested with a restriction enzyme (only EcoRI for the
panel of diploid species EcoRI, DraI and BamHI for the
Coffea arabica cv. IAPAR-59) and separated by agarose
gel electrophoresis. The digested DNA was transferred
to Hybond-N+ nylon membranes for Southern hybridization as described in Noir et al. [70]. SH3-CNL family
specific probe was obtained by PCR amplification using
primers designed on the NBS domain (left primer:
5’-CGGTCTCGGTAAGACCACTC-3’and right primer
5’-CCTCTGCAAATGGAAATGCT-3’). The amplified
516 bp fragment was labeled with [32P]-dATP according
to the manufacturer’s recommendations (Megaprime
DNA Labelling Systems kit, Amersham) and used as
probe in the hybridization experiment as described in
Sambrook et al. [73].
Motif predictions

SMART protein motif analyses (http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de) and Pfam database (http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/
search/sequence) were used to detect motifs in the SH3CNL genes. COILS with a threshold of 0.9 was used to
specifically detect CC domains [74].
Gene Conversion

In order to check the possibility of conversion events
among the the S H 3-CNL members, alignments of
sequences from C. arabica and C. canephora species were
analyzed with the RDP3 software [50] using the default settings (but linear instead of circular sequences were
selected, in general settings). The program uses simultaneously different recombination detection methods, including RDP and GeneConv [75], to both detect and
characterize the recombination events that are evident
within a sequence alignment without any prior user indication of a non-recombinant set of reference sequences [50].
Pairwise P values are assigned based on the comparison of
each fragment with the maximum fragment length that is
expected from the sequence pair by chance.

Sequencing and analysis of cloned SH3-CNL members

Plasmid DNA was sequenced at Genome Express (Grenoble, France) using M13-universal- forward and reverse primers and five other internal primers were designed using
the Primer3 program (Whitehead Institute, USA) to allow
whole gene sequencing. INT1-L: 5-TCCATCGTCCAAGATACAGC-3, INT2-L: 5-TTTGTTGGGATGGAAG
ATGA-3, INT3-L: 5-GCTGGGAGTTGCTTCAAAAG-3,
INT4-L: 5-TCGAATGTGGACAGCAGAAG-3, INT5L: 5-GCCTTGGAGACACTTCCATC-3. The cloned
sequence contigs were assembled using the Staden package [71]. The complete sequences of each clone were
aligned using Bioedit v.7.0 [72].

Sequence evolution

Protein sequences were manually aligned with the BioEdit program. The amino acid sequence alignments were
used to guide the alignments of nucleotides using
MEGA version 4.1 [76]. Nucleotide diversity (π) was calculated by DnaSP v.5 [77] where each paralog was considered as an independent allele of population.
The Ka/Ks ratio was estimated by DnaSP v5.1 based
on Nei and Gojobori’s equation [78] for full-length CDS
for specific domains: (CC, NBS, LRR), for the xxLxLxx
motifs in the LRR domain, and for the solvent-exposed
residues (i.e. only the x residues in the xxLxLxx motif).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/240

P values were calculated and the significance level was
compared at 0.05 and 0.01%.
Microsynteny Analysis

The search for putative gene orthologs of the genes at
the SH3 locus was performed by TBLASTN analysis on
the tomato genome sequence (Solanum lycopersicum)
available in Solanaceae Genome Network (http://www.
sgn.cornell.edu).
