Abstract
Background: Modern sequencing technologies allow rapid sequencing and bioinformatic analysis of
genomes and metagenomes. With every new sequencing project a vast number of new proteins become
available with many genes remaining functionally unclassified based on evidences from sequence similarities
alone. Extending similarity searches with gene pattern approaches, defined as genes sharing a distinct
genomic neighbourhood, have shown to significantly improve the number of functional assignments.
Further functional evidences can be gained by correlating these gene patterns with prevailing
environmental parameters. MetaMine was developed to approach the large pool of unclassified proteins
by searching for recurrent gene patterns across habitats based on key genes.
Results: MetaMine is an interactive data mining tool which enables the detection of gene patterns in an
environmental context. The gene pattern search starts with a user defined environmentally interesting key
gene. With this gene a BLAST search is carried out against the Microbial Ecological Genomics DataBase
(MEGDB) containing marine genomic and metagenomic sequences. This is followed by the determination
of all neighbouring genes within a given distance and a search for functionally equivalent genes. In the final
step a set of common genes present in a defined number of distinct genomes is determined. The gene
patterns found are associated with their individual pattern instances describing gene order and directions.
They are presented together with information about the sample and the habitat. MetaMine is implemented
in Java and provided as a client/server application with a user-friendly graphical user interface. The system
was evaluated with environmentally relevant genes related to the methane-cycle and carbon monoxide
oxidation.
Conclusion: MetaMine offers a targeted, semi-automatic search for gene patterns based on expert input.
The graphical user interface of MetaMine provides a user-friendly overview of the computed gene patterns
for further inspection in an ecological context. Prevailing biological processes associated with a key gene
can be used to infer new annotations and shape hypotheses to guide further analyses. The use-cases
demonstrate that meaningful gene patterns can be quickly detected using MetaMine.

Background
More than 99% of the microbial diversity on earth still
resists cultivation. To address their metabolic potential,
numerous efforts to clone and sequence large DNA-fragments directly from the environment (the metagenome)
have been accomplished worldwide. Several studies [1-3]
have shown that on average only for 27–48% of the genes
a specific function can be inferred by similarity searches
[4]. This untapped pool of so called hypothetical proteins
represents a still unexploited source for new enzymatically
driven reactions.
With the availability of a large number of complete
genomes comparative genomics becomes increasingly
important. The major aspect of this approach is the analysis of gene neighbourhoods to indicate functional association, which can therefore significantly improve the
predictions of gene functions. This idea was first systematically applied in 1999 by Overbeek and colleagues [5].
They introduced the concept of a "pair of close bidirectional best hits" and could prove functional coupling of
such genes for several pathways. Some years later the subsystem approach was introduced [6,7], which is a generalization of the pathway concept and describes a group of
related functional roles jointly involved in a specific
aspect of the cellular machinery. Today systems like IMG
[8]/IMG/M [9], STRING [10,11] and RAST [12] provide
several functionalities to analyse gene neighbourhoods
and other protein interaction features for a broad range of
microbial genomes based on pre-computed data.
Additional support for functional evidences might be
gained by correlating these gene patterns with prevailing
environmental parameters. The growing number of
genome and metagenome sequences from the environment, especially from the marine system, opens for the
first time the possibility to link genomic information with
environmental parameters in a systematic way [13-15].
Subsequently, if process correlated gene patterns can be
identified in the habitats it should be possible to return
hints on the functions of the respective patterns.
MetaMine is an interactive data mining tool which enables the detection of gene patterns, defined as genes sharing a distinct genomic neighbourhood, initiated by a user
provided key gene. The underlying pipeline was designed
to handle genomic data sets where gene family classification information is not available or incomplete. Because
consistent family classification is a prerequisite for the
pattern determination step we first calculate gene groups
of functional equivalence. This is still an open research
problem. Therefore, our system allows the user to work
with different parameter settings and to switch between
alternative methods. By focussing on the resulting patterns the calculation of the functional groups allows the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/459

inclusion of highly similar paralogs and genes to be part
in several groups, because errors made in this step can be
easily revealed by the gene patterns found. Given a user
selected key gene of environmental relevance MetaMine
carries out a semi-automatic search for gene patterns on a
regularly updated database of marine genomes and
metagenomes. The gene patterns found are presented to
the user together with information about the samples and
the habitat within an interactive graphical user interface
(GUI) for further inspection. To our knowledge, currently
no system exists combining genomic and metagenomic
pattern information with environmental parameters.

Implementation
Microbial Ecological Genomics Database
The Microbial Ecological Genomics DataBase (MEGDB)
contains prokaryotic genome and metagenome sequences
of marine origin together with information about their
environmental context. A list of criteria have been used to
select the (meta-)genomic sequences to build the database: i) public access (sequences must be available in one
of the public sequence databases [16]); ii) marine origin;
iii) bacterial or archaeal; iv) high sequence quality (i.e.
assembled contigs with a sequencing coverage of at least
eight fold) and v) the exact geographic origin of the
sequences (e.g. from the original publication).

Habitat parameters like water and sediment depths, temperature, salinity, and other physical-chemical properties
have been extracted from the literature or extrapolated
based on global ocean data sets like the World Ocean
Atlas and the World Ocean Database [17] and remote
sensing information (SeaWiFS) [18] within the EU project
MetaFunctions [19]. A detailed overview of the current
content of MEGDB can be found at http://www.megx.net/
portal/content/content.html.
Besides MetaMine, public access to the MEGDB is granted
by the MetaLook tool [20] and especially the Genomes
Mapserver as a central entry point [14,21]. A GeographicBLAST tool is also available online to get an overview of
the geographical distribution of particular genes across
the world.
Gene patterns and key gene approach
The term "gene pattern" often covers two related biological observations in genetics/genomics. In prokaryotic
genomes, genes are often organised in operons, where
transcription leads to a single messenger RNA molecule
(mRNA) encoding different subunits of a protein or even
distinct, but related proteins. The definition of an operon,
as a set of commonly regulated genes is strict, but as long
as no common mRNA is proven experimentally, the corresponding set of genes is often called a gene cluster/gene
pattern which is loosely defined as a set of neighbouring

genes with possibly coupled functions and/or conserved
order across organisms.

ilar genes found by this BLAST search presented to the user
in a specific BLAST panel within the MetaMine GUI.

The distinction between operons and gene patterns is not
crucial for the biological questions we want to address
with MetaMine. Moreover, the detection of habitat specific gene patterns requires some extensions with respect
to environmental parameters in the concept described
above. For the systematic search for correlations between
the habitat and the gene content two basic types of gene
patterns are of interest: (1) genes which are present or
over/under-represented under specific environmental
conditions and (2) patterns consisting of a set of genes
occurring in specific genomic neighbourhoods. If such
gene patterns are found genomic context analysis assists
in potential functional assignments. In addition, if gene
patterns correlate with distinct environmental parameters
or processes further evidences for potential functions may
be inferred. MetaMine was designed to detect such gene
patterns. Due to the huge amount of genomic and
metagenomic sequences we decided to apply a bottom-up
approach, where prior biological knowledge is used to
select a so-called key gene with known biological function
and environmental relevance which plays the role of a
seed to search for gene patterns in genomic sequences
with at least two predicted genes.

5. Determination of neighbouring genes
Given a user-defined parameter k the k neighbouring
genes to each side with respect to all the genes found by
the BLAST search in the previous step are determined and
shown in tabular form. Using mouseover as well as a second panel the user can see detailed information about the
functional annotation of the genes.

Process steps
For gene pattern discovery the user can carry out the following process steps starting with the selection of the key
gene. A detailed description of the analysis process including a flowchart can be found in the user guide available on
the website and as Additional file 2.

6. BLAST search of all neighbouring genes
A BLAST search is carried out with all neighbouring genes
from the last step. The results are represented by a hash
table containing the set of all neighbouring genes together
with their associated BLAST results. The user can access
this hash table by clicking a gene in the neighbour table
and gets the associated BLAST information in the corresponding BLAST panel.
7. Determination of functionally equivalent genes
In order to detect functionally equivalent genes a reciprocal best hit approach followed by a clustering algorithm is
carried out. The result is a set of groups, whereby each
group represents genes of functional equivalence. All
group members are colour-coded and presented to the
user in the table of neighbouring genes (Fig. 1). In addition, the reciprocal best matches and the functional
groups are shown in separate views.

1. & 2. Definition of a project and a key gene
In order to store and retrieve the results of a certain analysis the corresponding processing steps are organised in a
project described by a project name, the user and a short
comment. Also the key gene is defined by a name, a short
description of its function and a comment.

8. Determination of gene patterns
Given two user-defined parameters minimal length l and
quorum q a gene pattern is defined as a set of at least l
genes (functional groups) which are all present in at least
q different genomes or metagenome samples. Each pattern is associated with a pattern instance view. Pattern
instances describing also gene order and directions are
shown with their environmental information in tabular
form (see also Fig 1). Guidelines for parameter settings
can be found in the user guide (see Additional file 2).

3. Import/retrieval of the corresponding key gene sequence
The corresponding key gene sequence(s) can be imported
from an external file containing the protein sequence in
Fasta-format or by retrieving the protein sequence from
the MEGDB.

9. Storage and retrieval of all intermediate results
All intermediate results are organised in special data
objects which can be stored to and retrieved from the local
MEGDB (stand-alone version only) as well as exported to
and imported from external XML files.

4. BLAST search with key gene
Using the key gene sequence as a query for a BLAST search
[22] against all marine genomic and metagenomic
sequences with at least two predicted genes stored in the
MEGDB is carried out. The result is a table with information about e-value, organism, sampling site, habitat, water
and sediment depths and potential gene functions of sim-

Each process step can be repeated with other parameters
resulting in a tree structure to organise intermediate
results. As shown in the left panel of Fig. 1, the user can
navigate through the history of all steps to analyse the corresponding results in detail. The user should be aware that
the final results can be influenced by the methods and
parameter settings of all previous steps. Therefore, the differences can be used to prove the stability of the results. In

case a certain gene is not in the functional group or gene
pattern as expected this roll back mechanism allows further in depth analysis.
If the user specifies all parameters in advance he can also
start a batch-mode analysis. All parameters can be
adjusted using the Parameter Dialog "Set Parameters" in
the Settings menu.
Algorithms
The following section gives a short overview of the underlying algorithms describing basic ideas and strategies.
Determination of functionally equivalent genes
In this step we are interested in finding groups of functionally equivalent genes which constitute the elements
for the next step – the determination of common gene
patterns. Different concepts and methods to obtain such
groups exist. The classical and well established method –
introduced by Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG)
[23] – relies on the phylogeny-based concept of orthology. Orthology describes genes in different species that
have derived from a common ancestor by speciation in
contrast to paralogous genes which arise from a duplication event. Therefore, orthology represents a strong relationship with a high potential describing the same

biological function. Nevertheless, it is a phylogenetic concept originally introduced to study gene evolution. Consequently this excludes paralogs which might still have
same functions. A complementary concept is to model
intrinsic properties for gene function derived from multiple alignments and domain architecture as it is applied by
Pfam [24,25]. A third variant are automatic methods
based on sequence similarity and unsupervised clustering
like TRIBES [26].
A large proportion of our data set consists of metagenome
samples with a high potential of new gene sequences not
present in existing databases which might form new and
sometimes small functional groups. Therefore, we started
with the basic idea of COG and relaxed the constraints for
metagenomes and inparalogs [27]. In general orthology is
a well established concept for functional annotation and
with the establishment of the gene patters the potential
error of including some false positives is easily ruled out.
In this context Boekhorst and Snel [28] have shown that
"sharing gene order and similarity in size dramatically
increases the chance of a query-hit pair being homologous".
To detect the groups of functionally equivalent genes we
use a heuristic approach restricted to the gene sequences

found in the BLAST searches which consist mainly of the
following two steps:
• determination of reciprocal best matches and
• determination of groups of functionally equivalent
genes.
Let G denote a set of identifiers for all genome and
metagenome sequences which are stored in MEGDB and
associated with an organism name and a sampling site,
respectively and R denote a set of identifiers for all
sequence regions which are predicted to be a protein
encoding gene, then genome: R → G is a function determining the genome identifier for a certain gene. Let br
denote the result of a BLAST search for gene r ∈ R against
the MEGDB and B a set of BLAST results br for a given set
R, then rbm: R × B × G → R is a function determining the
identifier of the reciprocal best BLAST hit for gene r ∈ R
with respect to genome g ∈ G.
A reciprocal best match is commonly defined as follows:
Gene ga in genome GA is the best match of gene gb in
genome GB and gene gb is the best match of gene ga. Given
the set of BLAST results B the function rbm checks this constraint for the genes and genomes specified. The search for
reciprocal best matches is restricted to the set Rn ⊂ R representing the genes found in the BLAST search with the
key gene and their neighbours. Therefore, Rn corresponds
to the upper table in the right panel in Fig. 1. In addition,
the set of genomes Gn ⊂ G is restricted to ∪r ∈ Rn genome(r).
These are the genomes related to the genes (and their
neighbours) found in the BLAST search with the key gene,
which correspond to the rows of this table. The result of
this step is a hash map RBM with key r ∈ Rn storing a vector of genome related reciprocal best matches rbm =
(rbmg1, rbmg2, ..., rbmgn) with ∀gi ∈ Gn for each gene from
the neighbour table. This intermediate result can be seen
in the second table in the Orthology Panel.
The next step is the determination of functional groups
which is based only on the information stored in the hash
map RBM and carried out in a bottom-up manner. Let F
denote this set of functional groups where each group fi ∈
F, i = 1, ..., |F| contains a set of functionally equivalent
genes, they are established as follows:
• For each gene r ∈ Rn the corresponding vector of genome
related reciprocal best matches is retrieved from the hash
map RBM and checked for triangle relationships of reciprocal best matches. If such a triangle relationship exists
between at least three genes of the vector a potential group
fnew is created with these genes. This strategy corresponds
to the COG approach [23].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/459

• Check the new group against all already existing groups
F for the following three cases: a) all genes of fnew are contained in a group fi. Then fnew is not needed and will be
removed. b) If the intersection of fnew with a group fi is ≥ 3
genes and there are remaining genes in fnew not contained
in group fi, check these remaining genes for triangle relationships in fi and include them if possible. If all remaining genes could be included in group fi, fnew is not needed
and will be deleted. c) There exists at least one gene from
fnew which could not be included in any group fi then fnew
is added to the set F.
• Check all groups of set F for subset relationships. Delete
the smaller one from F and keep only one set in case of
equivalence.
Based on this procedure a gene can be part of several functional groups, a functional group can contain several
genes from the same genome (inparalogs) but outparalogs are excluded by the rbm approach.
Determination of gene patterns
As described above, for our approach we define a gene
pattern as a set of shared genes within a given genomic
neighbourhood. This definition corresponds to a problem
known as gene team model [29-32], which searches for a set
of gene groups that co-occur in a given set of genomes.
Further information on formal models can be found in
chapter 8 of Mandoiu [33]. The order and the orientation
of the genes need not be conserved, and insertions/deletions are allowed within the gene patterns. For in depth
analysis we use the concept of pattern instance describing
these properties, which are neglected in the process of pattern determination. The approaches mentioned above
[29-32] are different with respect to the following features:
i) if they are designed for two or more input genomes, ii)
if they restrict a gene to be unique in a genome/chromosome or if paralogs are allowed. In addition, these
approaches require consistent family assignments of
genes for all input genomes, which is not available or
incomplete in many cases. Hu and colleagues [34] call this
type of problem gene pattern mining problem and describe
a very similar approach compared to ours.

For the pattern discovery step we have implemented two
methods: a systematic search and a heuristic to reduce the
search space. The systematic search is adapted from the
character enumeration approach successfully applied in
motif search algorithms like Pratt [35,36] and TEIRESIAS
[37] with the difference that the basic unit to enumerate is
a functional group instead a single character.
Given the set of functional groups F of the previous step
ordered by a numerical identifier and the parameters minPatternLength and q (quorum) describing the minimal

Page 5 of 10
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Bioinformatics 2008, 9:459

length of a pattern as well as the minimal number of different sequences in which a pattern should be present, the
systematic search is carried out as follows:
Let P denote the set of pattern to be determined, then P is
initialized with patterns of length 1 represented by the
entities f ∈ F. Each pattern is associated with a set of
(meta-)genome identifiers Gp ⊂ G where it occurs. In each
iteration i, i = 2, ..., |F| all patterns p ∈ P ∧ |p| = i-1 (the
patterns from the last iteration having length i-1) are
enlarged by the functional group having the next higher
identifier and checked whether the corresponding set of
genome identifiers covers more or equal entities than q. If
yes, the pattern will be added to P. This systematic search
guarantees to find all patterns fulfilling the constraints of
the given parameters, but it has an exponential growing
search space depending on the number of functional

Therefore, it provides storage and retrieval functions for
the MEGDB. In addition, there are functions to read and
write to the file system especially for the import of key
gene sequences stored in FASTA format and to import and
export the analysis results as XML files for further data
exchange. The BLAST database file containing the protein
sequences for the BLAST searches belongs also to this
layer. In principle it is possible to exchange the underlying
database with an own version.
The application layer contains all objects and methods
implementing the application logic by providing methods
for all functions provided to the user (see description of
prototype for details). In addition, interfaces to external
programs like BLAST for the sequence similarity search
exist, as well as readers and writers for specific file formats
used in molecular biological applications.
The presentation layer comprises the graphical user interface and the controller which activates the functions chosen by the user.

Results and discussion
Therefore, a second method was implemented combining
the systematic search and a heuristic. In order to generate
a pattern there are two entities, which have to be checked:
i) the functional groups as constituents for a pattern and
ii) the (meta-) genome(s), where the pattern is present. In
contrast to the systematic search based on the functional
groups the heuristic inverts the constituents and the test in
the following sense. First the gene patterns are generated
as described above until a user-specified length minLengthHeuristics with default value of five. Second, for the set P
of patterns found so far, the associated sets of (meta)genome identifiers Gp are collected and filtered to be
redundancy-free. The resulting set contains all genome
combinations Gp, where a pattern can occur. Then, for
each (meta-)genome combination Gp the largest set of
shared functional groups are determined applying the
intersection operation. Given a set of genome combinations the advantage of this heuristic is its ability to detect
long gene patterns very quickly without explicit generation and testing of all functional group combinations,
which can be a huge number.
System architecture
The system was implemented using a three-tier architecture that allows flexibility for subsequent integration of
MetaMine into other systems. It can be used in two
modes: as stand-alone system with direct access to a local
database or as a client-server application using web services for all database operations.

The persistence layer is responsible for the permanent
storage and retrieval of all necessary data for MetaMine.

The MetaMine software was tested using the MEGDB
which contains high-quality georeferenced marine
genomes and metagenomes of prokaryotic origin. This
pattern detection approach can also successfully applied
on large metagenome data sets based on shot-gun
sequencing approaches as long as a significant fraction
contains sequences with at least two predicted genes. Harrington et al. [4] reported recently that 47% of short
metagenome sequences obtained by whole genome shotgun sequencing in fact have neighbours even in the same
transcriptional direction.
The focus of MetaMine is searching for gene patterns representing biological functions occurring in specific environmental contexts regardless their evolutionary history.
Even if the current public DNA sequence databases covers
only a fraction of the natural prokaryotic diversity [38],
numerous environmentally relevant microbial pathways
occurring in marine environments have been discovered
and genetically described [39-41]. Two examples illustrating the benefits of the semi-automatic gene pattern discovery procedure of MetaMine for the study of globally
important metabolic pathways in (meta-)genomic context are presented.
Archaea C1 metabolism gene patterns
Methanogenesis and the Anaerobic Oxidation of Methane
(AOM) are two microbial metabolic pathways of environmental relevance, because they produce and consume the
greenhouse gas methane in marine sediments, respectively. A MetaMine analysis using archaeal C1 key genes
(mcrA, mcrB, mcrC, mcrD, mcrG, mrtC taken from [42])

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/459

discovered five distinct gene patterns called mcrB/G/A-14,
mcrC-14, mcrB/D/C/G/A-5a/11, mcrC/B/G/A-5b and
mrtC-17, where the name describes the key genes contained and the length of the patterns (see Fig. 2 and Additional file 1). As expected, the analysis shows that all key
genes and their associated patterns occur exclusively in the
habitat type "sediment". The computational results foster
the functional coupling of the genes with respect to their
involvement in the C1 metabolism. Furthermore, all patterns, except that found in isolated organisms (mcrB/D/C/
G/A-5a/11), revealed conserved hypothetical genes (chp;
all red genes in Fig. 2) indicating their potential role in
these particular metabolisms. These genes represent interesting new functional candidates and should be prior targets for wet-lab experiments. Moreover, four of the five
gene patterns could be detected on metagenomic fragments, but not on complete genomes, which might reflect
the specific modifications needed for the AOM metabolism as compared to the classical methanogenesis pathway [43,42,39].

cals who are also able to oxidize methane and nitrous
oxides and is therefore an indirect mediator of the greenhouse effect [40]. Interestingly, microorganisms from the
surface ocean water have recently been shown to carry
genes encoding CO oxidation pathways, potentially influencing the diffusion of this gas in the atmosphere [44,45].

Carbon monoxide oxidation gene patterns
Carbon monoxide (CO) is a gas evaporating from the
ocean into the atmosphere. CO reacts with hydroxyl radi-

Conclusion

In order to search for gene patterns associated with CO
oxidation, the corresponding key genes have been used as
input for a MetaMine analysis (coxL, GenBank:
AAV95654 and GenBank: AAV94806[44,40]). The results
show four main gene patterns including up to five genes
(Fig. 3 and Additional file 1). Two conserved hypothetical
genes can be found within these patterns, which designate
them as potentially relevant for the CO oxidation pathways (Fig. 3, green and blue genes). Furthermore, one out
of the eight gene patterns could be found exclusively in
genomes isolated from marine sediments/geothermal
sources, but not in genomes originating from the water
column (Fig 3, pattern ID 70).

The exponentially growing DNA sequence datasets can
only be handled effectively using semi-automatic process-

ing pipelines that go beyond similarity based approaches.
It has been shown that comparative approaches can significantly improve the quantity and quality of functional
assignments leading to deeper insights into the complex
metabolic and regulatory processes in a cell. The ecogenomic revolution initiated by the Venter cruises some
years ago has opened the door to expand this approach by
correlating syntenic gene patterns with specific environmental parameters and associated prevailing biological
processes.
MetaMine offers a targeted, knowledge driven system to
detect gene patterns for subsequent correlation with environmental information. First, the system is meant to confirm existing biological knowledge about genes involved
in specific processes or pathways. Second, the approach
has the potential to detect genes of so far unknown functions but functionally linked to specific habitat parameters. By integrating structural genomic information with
environmental conditions MetaMine helps to find the
"needle in the (meta)genomic haystack" especially for
genes of so far unknown function. This reduced set of
genes contains than prime candidates for further detailed
functional analysis in the wet-lab. A use-case for Archaea
C1 metabolism and CO oxidation genes showed that

meaningful initial results can be quickly generated using
MetaMine and a set of user-defined key genes. Further
developments will concentrate on the incorporation of
further genomic and metagenomic sequences, additional
environmental parameters and further methods for the
detection of functionally equivalent genes. In addition, to
enhance the usability of MetaMine we plan to include
links to external resources like GO or KEGG to support
functional annotation as well as concepts to compare the
functional groups found by MetaMine with other systems
like COG.

version of the underlying database and integrated the
metagenomic data. UB and TL carried out and evaluated
the biological test examples. UB, RK and TL participated
in installing the MetaMine system as client server version
at MPI. FOG is leading the EU-project MetaFunctions,
gave advises for software development and has made revisions and contributions to the manuscript.
