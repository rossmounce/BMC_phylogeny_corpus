Abstract
Background: Male - female incompatibilities can be critical in keeping species as separate and discrete units.
Premating incompatibilities and postzygotic hybrid sterility/inviability have been widely studied as isolating barriers
between species. In recent years, a number of studies have brought attention to postmating prezygotic barriers arising
from male - male competition and male - female interactions. Yet little is known about the genetic basis of postmating
prezygotic isolation barriers between species.
Results: Using D. simulans lines with mapped introgressions of D. mauritiana into their third chromosome, we find at
least two D. mauritiana introgressions causing male breakdown in competitive paternity success. Eighty one genes
within the mapped introgressed regions were identified as broad-sense candidates on the basis of male reproductive
tract expression and male-related function. The list of candidates was narrowed down to five genes based on
differences in male reproductive tract expression between D. simulans and D. mauritiana. Another ten genes were
confirmed as candidates using evidence of adaptive gene coding sequence diversification in the D. simulans and/or D.
mauritiana lineage. Our results show a complex genetic basis for conspecific sperm precedence, with evidence of gene
interactions between at least two third chromosome loci. Pleiotropy is also evident from correlation between
conspecific sperm precedence and female induced fecundity and the identification of candidate genes that might
exert an effect through genetic conflict and immunity.
Conclusions: We identified at least two loci responsible for conspecific sperm precedence. A third of candidate genes
within these two loci are located in the 89B cytogenetic position, highlighting a possible major role for this
chromosome position during the evolution of species specific adaptations to postmating prezygotic reproductive
challenges.
Background
The Biological Species Concept defines species as actual
or potential interbreeding individuals that are reproductively isolated from others [1]. Any type of male - female
reproductive incompatibilities can therefore be critical in
keeping species as separate and discrete units. Premating
behavioral incompatibilities can arise as a consequence of
different competitive strategies between males, females
avoiding male mating signals, or male rejection of heterospecific females [2-4]. Postmating postzygotic mechanisms of isolation, such as hybrid inviability or sterility,

have also been widely studied as reproductive isolation
barriers between species [5].
In species where females mate with multiple males, a
different arena is set for male - male competition and
male - female interactions. There is evidence that polyandry imposes numerous pressures on the coevolution of
males and females, not only in terms of premating signalresponse exchanges, but also primary genital morphology
[6-9], sperm and female sperm storage organ morphology
[10-12] and even postmating chemical cues [13-15].
Coevolution under the competitive pressures imposed by
multiply mating females can contribute to reproductive
isolation by promoting genetic divergence between populations, possibly involving reinforcement [16-18].

One form of postmating prezygotic isolation is conspecific sperm precedence (CSP); defined as the preferential
utilization of conspecific sperm for fertilization, when
females have been inseminated by both conspecific and
heterospecific males. Conspecific sperm or gamete precedence has been studied in a wide variety of invertebrates, vertebrates, and plants [19]. One of the best
examples is from studies of natural populations of the
cricket genus Allonemobius, where two closely related
species capable of mating among heterospecifics in
nature are isolated by noncompetitive gametic isolation
as well as preferential fertilization by conspecifics [20,21].
In Drosophila melanogaster, females willingly remate in
both laboratory and wild populations [22,23], generating
an opportunity for sperm competition. The outcome of
sperm competition in Drosophila is commonly measured
as second male paternity success in double mating experiments and is influenced by complex male × male interactions [24], male × female interactions [25], male × male ×
female interactions and trade offs with other postmating
reproductive traits [26,27]. These interactions allude to
the complexity of the mechanisms underlying sperm
competition outcomes and also to the intricate nature of
male - female coevolution in Drosophila.
The within and between sexes interactions and trade
offs are likely to contribute to the large amount of
intraspecific variation in first (P1) and second (P2) male
paternity success, though the second male typically sires
the majority of progeny (more than 60%) [28,29]. This
pattern is also seen in heterotypic crosses involving D.
melanogaster cosmopolitan and Zimbabwe races but disappears when a female mates with a conspecific and a
heterospecific male. Regardless of the order of mating,
the conspecific male sires the majority of progeny [30,31].
Studies using females singly mated to heterospecific
males or doubly mated to a sterile conspecific and a fertile heterospecific male have identified both sperm incapacitation and sperm displacement as barriers to
heterospecific fertilization success [32,33]. However, a
detailed understanding of CSP in Drosophila is lacking
owing largely to experimental difficulties to discriminate
heterospecific and conspecific sperm within the reproductive tract of a doubly mated female.
Using a variety of approaches, the genetic basis of
intrinsic postmating isolation barriers between species
has been thoroughly studied. Studies of postzygotic isolation have led to the identification of hybrid sterility and
hybrid inviability genes [5]. However, only two studies
have previously attempted to map genes responsible for
CSP. Using D. simulans - D. sechellia introgression lines,
significant QTLs were detected on the second and third
chromosome only when using low stringency statistical
thresholds [34]. Another QTL approach using reciprocal
F2 backcross females of crosses between two crickets,

Allonemobius fasciatus and A. socius, mated to males of
the two species found several unlinked markers associated with either enhancing or reducing conspecific male
paternity success [35].
Here we use sixty D. simulans lines each with a single
D. mauritiana third chromosome mapped introgression
(IG lines) [36] in a double mating experimental design.
Heterozygous males from each of the IG lines were competed as second male against males of a pure D. simulans
strain. For some IG lines, the ability of males to sire progeny when second to mate did not differ significantly from
that of D. mauritiana males and so were identified as
poor sperm competitors. Males from these IG lines share
a D. mauritiana introgression and it appears that at least
two regions, one in the 77B to 84B and the other in the
88B to 92E cytogenetic map range, are sufficient to cause
CSP. We identify eighty one broad-sense candidate genes
within these chromosomal regions on the basis of male
reproductive expression and Gene Ontology searches
using broad search terms associated with sex and reproduction. The list was narrowed down by looking for regulatory and structural changes. On the basis of differential
gene expression in the male reproductive tract of D. simulans and D. mauritiana, we narrowed down the list of
candidates to five genes, three of them located within the
89B chromosomal position. Using an evolutionary
approach that fits models specifying different rates of
nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions within
coding sequences and along the D. simulans and D. mauritiana lineages, we identified an additional ten candidate
genes, two in the 89B map position, that have undergone
species specific adaptations. While the role of all fifteen
candidate genes is unclear, gene-gene interactions and
the coregulation of a gene cluster within the 89B cytogenetic map position appear to have been critical during the
evolution of species specific adaptations to competitive
male paternity success. Mst89B is a particularly interesting gene within the 89B position, because it has been
shown to indirectly interact with Acp62F [37], a gene
known to influence male sperm competitive ability in D.
melanogaster [29,38].

Results
At least two loci cause breakdown in second male paternity
success

A total of 2,635 D. simulans ebony females were set up to
doubly mate, first with a male of the same strain then
with a male from one of the 60 different IG lines. Females
were removed from the final analysis if they failed to mate
with either the first or the second male. Under these criteria, 913 females were excluded from the analysis leaving
us with a total sample of 1,722 females. The proportion of
progeny sired by the second (IG) male (P2) was angular
transformed (TP2) to better fit the assumption of a nor-

mal distribution required for ANOVA. The second male
paternity success scores were positively and significantly
correlated with measures of female induced fecundity
(Pearson correlation: R= 0.119; P < 0.001) so we tested
variation among the average P2 scores of different IG
lines using fecundity as a covariate. We found significant
variation in P2 scores among IG lines (F59,1599 = 7.11; P <
0.001) with twelve IG lines having P2 scores not significantly higher than D. mauritiana males (t-test IG vs. D.
mauritiana with P < 005) (Figure 1). We also found a significant block effect (F8,1599 = 5.71; P < 0.001) suggesting
that part of the differences detected between IG males
could be due to variation in environmental conditions
among block trials. However, we found no significant
male line × block interaction (F54,1599 = 1.15; P = 0.219)
showing consistent scores of IG lines averages over
blocks. The data were reanalyzed using only IG lines for
which at least ten males successfully mated and excluding
females that produced fewer than twenty offspring [34].
Under these criteria, we found consistent results of significant variation among IG lines (F52,1249 = 9.33; P <
0.001) and a significant block effect (F8,1249 = 4.89; P <
0.001) but a non-significant male line × block interaction
(F44,1249 = 1.26; P = 0.125). Under these conditions, eleven
IG lines have P2 scores not significantly higher than D.
mauritiana males. Ten of them are among the twelve previously identified IG lines, the data restriction led to no
data from two lines of the original twelve, and one IG line
is added to the previous list as not significantly different
from D. mauritiana males (Figure 2).
We found that all unhatched eggs were unfertilized
indicating that the P2 values are not affected by differential zygote viability among strains. Another variable likely

Page 3 of 12

to affect sperm competitive ability is copulation duration.
We assayed copulation duration from a subset of males
from 12 IG strains with different average P2 scores and
found no variation among strains (F11,188 = 1.13; P =
0.341), with all strains showing average copulation duration times more similar to D. simulans than to D. mauritiana males.
Figure 2 shows the D. mauritiana introgressions as
mapped in a previous study [36]. Five regions, numbered
one to five and shown as consecutive white and grey
areas, can be broadly defined in the map on the basis of
the introgression locations. All introgressions that span
over regions two, three and four cause average P2 scores
not significantly higher than D. mauritiana males (Figure
2, thick rectangle). This suggests that loci causing breakdown on second male paternity success must be located
within these three regions. However, the fact that introgressions spanning regions two and three or three and
four do not cause a breakdown in P2 (Figure 2, circle)
suggests that all three loci defined by regions two, three
and four, or at least two loci defined by regions two and
four, cause second male paternity success breakdown. A
size effect or the possibility of other loci contributing to
the phenotypic breakdown are suggested by introgressions spanning regions one, two, three and four (Figure 2,
thick rounded rectangle) and from IG lines with introgressions in region five having average P2 scores expected
under CSP (Figure 2).
The two loci (Figure 2, regions two and four) that are at
least needed to cause second male paternity breakdown
correspond to map positions 77B to 84B and 88B to 92E
as mapped by Tao and collaborators [36]. Within the
mapped chromosome locations, we identified 81 broadsense candidate genes on the basis of reproductive function and/or male reproductive tissue of expression (Additional file 1). It is important to note that even if we were
to include a third locus (region three), the extension will
not lead to additional candidate genes.
A larger concentration of differentially expressed
candidate genes is located in the 89B cytogenetic position

we show averages and standard errors. The average P2 score of D.
mauritiana is shown as a black circle. The upper bound of the 95% confidence interval of D. mauritiana average P2 is shown as a dotted line.

We used 60 IG lines to map loci causing CSP, but we are
ultimately interested in gene differences at mapped positions between pure species rather than IG lines. Therefore, differences in gene expression for all 81 broad-sense
candidate genes were tested between D. simulans and D.
mauritiana. We obtained RNA samples from the male
reproductive tract of both D. mauritiana and D. simulans
and performed quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)
from reverse transcribed products corresponding to our
81 broad-sense candidate genes. We identified between
five (CG10317, CG14891, Mst89B, CG6040 and CG4836)
and eight (same as before plus CG3610, CG17387 and

Figure 2 Map position for the 60 D. mauritiana introgressions within the D. simulans third chromosome tested in this study. Highlighted in
grey are the minimum two loci introgressions causing a breakdown in second male paternity success and chromosome sections are divided by the
two loci into five regions. Different shapes are used to box introgressions as spanning only regions 1 or 5 (rectangles), 2 and 3 or 3 and 4 (round edge
rectangle), 2 and 3 or 3 and 4 (circle), at least four regions (round edge thick rectangle), and 2, 3 and 4 (thick rectangle). Average P2 values are given
besides the line denoting the position of the introgression. Dashed lines are used for IG males with average P2 not significantly higher than D. mauritiana males. The thinner dashed line is used for one IG line that is not significantly different than D. mauritiana only when the reduced data set is used
for analysis (see results). Asteriks identified two IG lines for which data is lost when the reduced data set is used. One P2 value significantly higher than
D. mauritiana (underlined) containing the two candidate loci for CSP is suggestive of the possible existence of suppressor somewhere between 73A10
and 77B map position. Two other introgressions (within region 5) outside the mapped loci with average P2 nonsignificantly different than D. mauritiana are suggestive of other loci responsible for second male paternity breakdown. An inversion (relative to D. melanogaster map) is shown in the Xaxis.

CG31287) candidate genes with significant differences in
gene expression between the two species using either a
five or ten percent threshold level respectively (Figure 3).
This result is not qualitatively different when using twofold average differences in gene expression and its 95%
confidence interval as threshold (data not shown). Only
one (CG17387) of the eight genes is located in the 77B to
84B. Three of the five differentially regulated genes
(CG10397, CG14891 and Mst89B) as well as CG31287
are located in the 89B position suggesting that the evolution of species specific coregulation patterns of this gene
cluster could be critical during species diversification and
the evolution of CSP.
DNA sequence data analysis of candidate genes

If species specific interactions are broken down in heterospecific crosses due to the presence of translated
products that differ in function, we expect to see species
specific signals in phylogenetic lineages leading to D. simulans and/or D. mauritiana. We tested all 81 broad-sense
candidate genes for evidence of variation in rates of evolution among lineages in D. melanogaster, D. simulans
and D. sechellia comparisons using currently available
sequence data from the Drosophila species genome project [39]. Using a comparison of the free-ratios model to
the one-ratio model of evolution available within PAML
we identified eighteen genes, equally distributed along
the two mapped loci as showing evidence of variable evolutionary rates among lineages. Six out of the 18 genes
showed significant acceleration in the D. simulans lineage
relative to the other two background lineages, with
another three genes showing significant deceleration.

Figure 3 Average fold difference in expression from male reproductive tract RNA extractions for 81 candidate genes between D.
simulans and D. mauritiana. The differences in gene expression are
shown as D. mauritiana relative to D. simulans (ma/si). The data is plotted with the X axis representing the cytogenetic map position. Experiment-wise statistical threshold at P < 0.05 and P < 0.1 are shown by
solid and dotted lines respectively. Notice that 3 out of 5 genes showing significant differences in gene expression (P < 0.05) are located in
map position 89B (CG14891, CG10317 and Mst89B).

One gene (CG14307 fruitless) showed both acceleration
and deceleration, while CG31232 showed deceleration or
no change, depending on the D. melanogaster alternative
translation product used for analysis (Table 1 and Additional file 1). Particularly interesting are genes that demonstrate not only evidence of change in rates of evolution
but also species specific adaptive diversification. Genes
CG7478, CG31542, CG1984, CG3158, CG14307 and
CG6255 exhibited both accelerated evolution and positive selection in the D. simulans lineage. Four other
genes, CG9389, CG15179, CG31287 and CG4836, did not
show evidence of a significant acceleration or deceleration but show evidence of positive selection in the D. simulans lineage (Table 1 and Additional file 1).
We noticed that seven genes lacked D. melanogaster
orthologs in D. sechellia and/or D. simulans due to the
presence of indels and/or nucleotide changes leading to
the occurrence of stop codons along the coding sequence
(missing in D. sechellia: CG9391, CG34357, CG1041,
CG7362, CG5178, CG14891; missing in D. simulans:
CG9063, CG34357, CG7362). With the exception of
CG34357, whose gene region spans 64 Kb (Flybase), we
partially sequenced all other six gene coding sequences in
D. simulans and/or D. mauritiana and found that the lack
of orthology is either restricted to D. sechellia or simply
the result of sequencing errors in the genome database
entry (Additional file 2). We therefore used our D. mauritiana, and in some cases D. simulans, partial sequences to
test for variable rates of evolution and positive selection
along the D. simulans lineage in D. melanogaster, D. simulans and D. mauritiana sequence alignments. Genes
CG7362 and CG14891 showed evidence of positive selection along the D. simulans branch (Table 1 and Additional file 1).
With the exception of CG14307, we also partially
sequenced D. mauritiana for all 12 genes showing evidence of positive selection along the D. simulans lineage
(Table 1) and tested them using both PAML branch and
branch-site models using the D. simulans, D. sechellia or
D. melanogaster, D. mauritiana trio. In the 77B-84B
locus, we detected evidence of positive selection in either
D. simulans and/or D. mauritiana for CG7478, CG31542,
CG1984 and CG1041. In the 88B-92E locus, CG7362,
CG3158, CG31287, CG14891, CG6255 and CG4836 all
showed evidence of positive selection. Only two
(CG31287 and CG14891) of these ten genes are located
within a common cytogenetic map position, 89B (Table
2). This result reinforces our previous observation, based
on gene expression analysis, that the 89B position might
have been critical during species diversification and the
evolution of species specific adaptations to postmating
prezygotic reproductive challenges.

Discussion
The use of third chromosome D. mauritiana introgressions within a D. simulans genomic background has
allowed us to establish the effect of such introgressions
on a male's ability to father progeny when second to mate.
We found significant variation in second male paternity
success between the IG lines tested and also a significant
correlation between second male paternity success and
female induced fecundity. This correlation is expected
given that sperm competition measured as a proportion
of the progeny sired by the tester male is a subset of his
ability to stimulate female progeny production (i.e. fecundity) and that such correlation has been previously found

in similar tests using Drosophila strains [29,34]. The correlation detected in our study raises the possibility that
lower second male paternity success might be due to poor
fertility of the IG males. This possibility is likely given
that some of the IG strains used in our test have been
reported to be subfertile or even sterile when the D. mauritiana introgression is in homozygote condition [36].
However, we found that differences in female induced
fecundity by IG males are not responsible for low sperm
competitive ability. Our result is in agreement with prior
findings showing that D. simulans females singly inseminated by a conspecific male produce a significantly higher
average number of progeny than D. simulans females sin-

gly mated with D. mauritiana males, but that such
reduced female fecundity is not enough to explain CSP
[32,33].
While the extent of variation in P2 among IG lines
highlights the complex genetic basis of male reproductive
success, we have identified a chromosome introgression
responsible for CSP. Two regions within it appear to be
co-required to breakdown male competitive paternity
success. Moreover, while previous studies have established associations between single genes and variation in
first and second male paternity success in D. melanogaster [28,29], this study is the first to establish such associations in crosses between closely related species of
Drosophila. We therefore provide a genetic basis for a
well characterized postmating prezygotic isolation barrier in Drosophila that has been elusive in an earlier
quantitative trait loci study [34].
Our mapping result identifies a minimum of two loci
but does not rule out additional loci that could cause and/
or suppress the phenotype. The presence of suppressor
loci is suggested by males of one IG line showing no
breakdown in second male paternity despite the presence
of the two causative loci (Figure 2, underlined P2 value).
There are also two introgressions outside the mapped
area that could be additional loci influencing second male

paternity success. Our mapping indicates that multiple
genetic elements and gene interactions likely underlie the
genetic basis of conspecific sperm precedence in Drosophila. This observation is in line with the view that complex epistasis plays a major role during evolution, species
differentiation, and isolation. The identification of an epistatic basis of conspecific sperm precedence does not
necessarily rule out the existence of genes of larger effect
within our two mapped loci. An example is that the original mapping of Odysseus as a locus causing hybrid male
sterility [40] was followed by the identification of additional nearby genes needed to cause full hybrid male sterility [41]. Nevertheless, Odysseus is now known as a gene
that normally functions in spermiogenesis by increasing
sperm production in young males [42] and has become a
clear example of how an introgression mapping approach
can lead to the identification of single genetic elements
that underlie interspecies isolation.
We have identified a series of candidate genes within
the mapped loci on the basis of gene regulatory differentiation and changes in coding sequences driven by adaptive diversification between D. simulans and D.
mauritiana. Five of the eight candidates identified on the
basis of differential gene expression had been previously
shown to be differentially expressed in D. simulans and D.

Levesque et al. BMC Genetics 2010, 11:21
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/11/21

mauritiana using microarray analysis of testes gene
expression [43] and the other three are genes coding for
sperm proteins [44]. An interesting observation is that
four out of the eight differentially expressed genes are
located within the 89B cytogenetic map position, and so
are two of the ten genes showing evidence of positive
selection in the D. simulans and/or D. mauritiana lineage. It is possible that selection on protein coding genes
and coevolution with DNA binding regulatory elements
in this particular mapped position could play a major role
during the evolution of postmating prezygotic isolation
barriers. Selection driven coevolution has been demonstrated for X chromosome dosage compensation and the
misregulation of X-linked genes in Drosophila hybrids
that can lead to inviability [45].
Ten candidate genes were identified on the basis of
adaptive diversification along the D. simulans and/or D.
mauritiana lineage. The information available for these
genes from studies in D. melanogaster reveal little more
than the fact that they are linked to male reproduction on
the basis of their expression in testes. In species like
Drosophila, where females multiply mate, it is logical to
assume that the adaptive diversification detected for
these reproductive genes might be driven by their role in
competition for fertilization through male - female and/
or male - male interactions. However, it is interesting to
note that a few of these candidate reproductive genes
possibly exert an effect through genetic conflict and
pleiotropic effects. Mutations in one of our mapped candidate genes, CG3158 (spnE), disrupt Piwi interacting
RNA (piRNA) formation and therefore increases the
activity of retrotransposons [46,47]. Selfish genetic elements like transposons are known to manipulate sperm
and to impair sperm competitive ability [48,49]. Two
other candidate genes, CG7362 and CG7478, have been
characterized as members of the phagocytosis innate
immunity system [50,51] and previous studies have
shown evidence of tradeoffs between immune function
and male reproductive success [52,53].
Future studies will need to focus on both functional
assays and evolutionary analysis of the genes highlighted
in this study. For example, Mst89B protein has been suggested to interact with Cdlc2, a microtubule motor activity protein expressed in the sperm, as well as the
transcription regulator Brinker (Brk) [37]. In turn, both
Cdlc2 and Brk might interact with Acp62F, an accessory
gland protein shown to increase a male's ability to place
sperm in storage when the gene is knocked out by targeted deletions [38]. A population survey of sequence
variation at Acp62F has also established significant associations between polymorphisms at this gene and both
second male paternity success and female induced fecundity via a genetic interaction with another Acp [29].
Therefore, it will be important to establish whether a sin-

Page 8 of 12

gle knockdown of Mst89B in D. simulans is capable of
disrupting second male paternity success. Other mapped
candidate genes from this study would need to be
selected for simultaneous knockdowns, with proper controls to single out spurious side effects due to impaired
overall viability/fertility caused by the knockdown.

Conclusions
We identified at least two loci responsible for conspecific
sperm precedence. The power of the associations established in our study is in its capacity to narrow down, by
testing the effect of a large number of genetically manipulated lines on phenotypic variation, a large number of
genes to a manageable number of candidate genes. A
third of the candidate genes located within these two loci,
showing differential gene expression or signature of adaptive diversification between parental species, are located
in the 89B map position. Our finding highlights a potential major role for this chromosome position during the
evolution of species specific adaptations to postmating
prezygotic reproductive challenges.
Methods
Fly Stocks and maintenance

We used males from a set of 60 D. simulans strains that
contain D. mauritiana mapped introgression into their
third chromosome (IG lines). Each generation, the IG
lines were maintained by selecting orange eyed males carrying a D. mauritiana P-element insert and crossing
them to virgin females from a D. simulans B strain (white
eyes) [36]. A stock of D. simulans ebony mutant flies (e/e)
(black body color) and a wild-type stock of D. mauritiana
were acquired from the Drosophila Species Stock center
(UC San Diego, California: D. simulans stock 140210251.033; D. mauritiana stock 14021-0241.01). All stocks
were maintained in bottles containing standard cornmeal-molasses media on a 12 hour light/dark schedule at
22°C. Every generation, parental flies were collected and
placed into new bottles, left to mate and adults dumped
after seven days. Prior to setting up crosses for the experiments, males and females were collected from the stocks
on a 5 hour cycle to ensure virginity. Collection and sexing of the flies was carried out under light CO2 gas anesthetic. Males and females were separately aged to 3-6
days old in cornmeal-molasses vials containing no more
than 20 flies.
Phenotypic assays

Virgin 3-6 day old Drosophila simulans females homozygous for the ebony (e/e) mutation were mated to sameaged D. simulans ebony males. The mating was done en
masse for a period of two hours in a vial containing 10
females and 20 males. Females were then individually
aspirated to separate vials (vial 1) and males were dis-

Levesque et al. BMC Genetics 2010, 11:21
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/11/21

carded. Two days later, each female was presented with
two males, from an IG line, that were heterozygous
(orange eyes) for the D. mauritiana introgression.
Heterozygous were used because some homozygotes are
subfertile or sterile [36]. Mating was observed every 15
minutes for a total period of 8 hours. Males were discarded and females were aspirated into new vials (vial 2).
Four days later each female was individually transferred
to vial 3. Progeny from vials 1, 2 and 3 were counted on
the 23rd day after the beginning of oviposition and scored
based on phenotypic body coloration. Females that did
not produce ebony progeny in vial 1 were discarded from
further analysis (i.e. no first mating). The fraction of wildtype progeny in vials 2 and 3, sired by the IG male, was
designated as P2. The 60 strains were tested over time in
nine blocks with partial replicates. We also tested the
sperm competitive ability of a D. mauritiana wild-type
strain when second to mate. An analysis of variance
(ANOVA) was conducted using an angular transformation of P2 scores for the 60 IG strains tested, with fecundity as a covariate and both strain and block included as
factors. Males from an IG line showing an average P2
score not significantly higher than D. mauritiana males
were considered as not fitting the expected second male
sperm precedence pattern commonly observed in
intraspecific tests of sperm competition. Because the D.
mauritiana introgressions have been previously mapped
[36] we were able to establish associations between
mapped D. mauritiana introgressions and CSP.
Low average P2 scores could be influenced by copulation duration or viability differences among IG lines
under non-competitive settings. We therefore tested
males from a subset of 12 IG strains. Copulation between
virgin 3-6 days old D. simulans ebony females and IG
males was observed and timed. Virgin D. simulans (e/e)
females aged 3-6 days were mated en masse in a vial containing cornmeal-molasses media to males from one of
the IG lines. Ten females were placed in a vial with 15-20
males from an IG line and left together for a period of
eight hours at the end of which time the females were
individually transferred to egg-laying dishes and
inspected daily so that eggs that failed to hatch could be
checked for evidence of fertilization (i.e. cell division).
Mapping loci an candidate genes

Candidate genes within mapped introgressions causing
CSP were identified using the genetic map of D. melanogaster available at Flybase http://flybase.bio.indiana.edu/.
Candidate genes were selected based on chromosome
location and narrowed down by focusing on genes
expressed in male reproductive tissue. Tissue of gene
expression was determined using a gene expression
search via term link available at Flybase. Termlink categorizes genes by anatomy followed by organ systems.

Page 9 of 12

Within organ system it was possible to narrow down the
search to the male reproductive system. We also performed Gene Ontology searches via Term-Link using
broad search terms associated with sex and reproduction.
Additional candidate genes were identified, on the basis
of mapped chromosome position, from the Drosophila
melanogaster sperm proteome [44], from a study that
examined differences in gene expression between closely
related Drosophila sister species, and from candidate
accessory gland proteins [43,54]. The IG lines were used
as mapping tools, however; the ultimate goal of our study
was to identify relevant gene changes between parental
species within the mapped chromosome locations.
Therefore, candidate genes were tested for gene expression and DNA sequence differences in comparisons using
data from D. simulans and D. mauritiana.
DNA sequence data analysis

The DNA sequences of candidate genes were retrieved
from Flybase as well as genome alignment sequences data
available for D. melanogaster, D. simulans and D.
sechellia at the UCSC genome browser http://
genome.ucsc.edu/. Amino acid sequence alignments
were performed using the ClustalX program and the
alignments were used to generate nucleotide sequence
alignments using Pal2Nal [55]. We tested for significant
variation in ω (dN/dS per codon) rates of evolution along
branches leading to each of the species by comparing the
likelihood of a free-ratios model of evolution (M1) to the
likelihood of constant ratio of evolution (M0) using the
PAML software package [56]. Genes showing significant
variation in rates of evolution across lineages were further tested for evidence of acceleration and/or deceleration of evolutionary rates along the D. simulans lineage
by comparing the likelihood of a model that allows to
estimate different ω values for the foreground D. simulans branch and the other background branches (M2) to
the likelihood of the constant (M0) ratio model. We also
tested for evidence of positive selection along the D. simulans branch using the mixed branch-site model (model
= 2; NSsites = 2) within codeml [57]. The log-likelihood
of the branch-site model is compared to the same model
but fixing the ω value of the foreground D. simulans
branch to 1 so that any significant variation in ω between
foreground and background branches can be attributed
to positive selection as opposed to differences in selective
constraints [58]. It is possible that fast evolution and positive selection might also occur along other branches in
the Drosophila phylogeny. However, the purpose of our
study is to identify genes as candidates for CSP between
D. simulans and D. mauritiana. Here we limit our analysis to the D. simulans lineage in D. melanogaster, D. simulans and D. sechellia comparisons.

Levesque et al. BMC Genetics 2010, 11:21
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/11/21

According to Flybase, some D. melanogaster genes
lacked orthologs in D. simulans and/or D. sechellia.
Genes lacking orthologs in D. simulans were partially
sequenced in D. simulans (From A.G. Clark; strain 'sim2',
Winters, CA) to confirm nucleotide changes and/or
indels found in the published sequences (UCSC genome
browser) that lead to stop codons. Genes for which
orthologs are reported missing in D. sechellia were partially sequenced in D. mauritiana (Drosophila Species
Stock Center, 14021-0241.01). We also sequenced D.
mauritiana for genes showing evidence of positive selection suggesting D. simulans species specific adaptations.
Oligonucleotide primers for PCR and sequencing were
designed using Primer3 software [59] on the basis of conserved sequence regions in the D. melanogaster, D simulans and D. sechellia alignments. PCR products were
cleaned using the Wizard SV gel and PCR Clean-up system kit (Promega) and sequenced on both strands using a
Beckman Coulter CEQ 2000XL automated sequencer
(primers and PCR conditions available upon request). All
D. mauritiana and D. simulans sequences can be found
in GenBank under accession numbers GU931390 to
GU931405.
D. mauritiana and D. simulans sequences were tested
for the presence of an open reading frame. The PAML
analysis was repeated as described before but using the D.
simulans, D. mauritiana and D. sechellia (or D. melanogaster) trio and testing for changes in rates of evolution as
well as positive selection along the D. simulans and the D.
mauritiana branches.
Gene expression data analysis

Male reproductive tracts were dissected from virgin D.
simulans and D. mauritiana aged 3-6 days old. Dissections were carried out in 20 μl of PBS using fine forceps
under a dissecting light microscope. Each sample consisted of reproductive tracts from 50 males. The tissue
was stored at -20°C in 400 μl of RNA later® Tissue Collection: RNA Stabilization Solution (Ambion). Tissue was
removed from RNA later® following manufactures suggested protocols by pelleting tissue in equal volume of ice
cold PBS. RNA was isolated from the stored tissue using a
TRIzol based RNA extraction for tissue protocol. The
RNA pellet was resuspended in 40 μl of RNAse and
nuclease free water and stored at -70°C.
The relative transcript abundance of candidate genes
was determined in D. simulans and D. mauritiana by performing Real-Time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) using
the MiniOpticon Real-Time detection system from BioRad. Oligonucleotide primers were designed using
Primer3 software [59] and on the basis of conserved
sequence regions in the D. melanogaster, D simulans and
D. sechellia alignments. An iScript™ One-Step RT-PCR
Kit with SYBR® Green was used according to manufactur-

Page 10 of 12

ers suggested protocols with the only modifications being
the use of a 12.5 μl reaction volume and a three step PCR
reaction. Ct values were normalized to a reference gene
(RpL32) for each species and then fold differences in relative expression were calculated between species using the
2-ΔΔCt calculation [60]. Each gene was tested twice using
biological replicates and an average fold difference was
calculated. To test for significant differences in gene
expression and to control for experiment wise type I
errors for the large number of multiple tests, we generated an experiment wise statistical threshold by using the
five and ten percent tails of a population of 1,000 average
values obtained by randomly sampling from the data with
replacement.
