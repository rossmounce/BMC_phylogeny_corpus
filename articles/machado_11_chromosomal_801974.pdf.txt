Abstract
Background: The Characidium (a Neotropical fish group) have a conserved diploid number (2n = 50), but show
remarkable differences among species and populations in relation to sex chromosome systems and location of
nucleolus organizer regions (NOR). In this study, we isolated a W-specific probe for the Characidium and
characterized six Characidium species/populations using cytogenetic procedures. We analyzed the origin and
differentiation of sex and NOR-bearing chromosomes by chromosome painting in populations of Characidium to
reveal their evolution, phylogeny, and biogeography.
Results: A W-specific probe for efficient chromosome painting was isolated by microdissection and degenerate
oligonucleotide primed-polymerase chain reaction (DOP-PCR) amplification of W chromosomes from C. gomesi. The
W probe generated weak signals dispersed on the proto sex chromosomes in C. zebra, dispersed signals in both W
and Z chromosomes in C. lauroi and, in C. gomesi populations revealed a proximal site on the long arms of the Z
chromosome and the entire W chromosome. All populations showed small terminal W probe sites in some
autosomes. The 18S rDNA revealed distinctive patterns for each analyzed species/population with regard to proto
sex chromosome, sex chromosome pair, and autosome location.
Conclusions: The results from dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (dual-color FISH) using W and 18S rDNA
probes allowed us to infer the putative evolutionary pathways for the differentiation of sex chromosomes and NORs,
from structural rearrangements in a sex proto-chromosome, followed by gene erosion and heterochromatin
amplification, morphological differentiation of the sex chromosomal pair, and NOR transposition, giving rise to the
distinctive patterns observed among species/populations of Characidium. Biogeographic isolation and differentiation
of sex chromosomes seem to have played a major role in the speciation process in this group of fish.

Background
The Crenuchidae is widespread in freshwater systems of
the South and Central Americas [1]. The Characidium is
the most representative group in this family, comprising
50 valid species [1]. This is a particularly interesting Neotropical fish group for cytogenetic studies because it presents a diversified model of sex chromosomes [2]. In the
Characidium, a diploid number of 50 chromosomes is

observed in all studied species and a karyotype of 32 m +
18 sm is most commonly reported [2-10].
Although the diploid number is conserved, the Characidium exhibit remarkable interspecific and interpopulation differences, such as (i) inter- and intraindividual
variation of B chromosomes in some species [3-5]; (ii) a
sex chromosome system with ZZ/ZW female heterogamety [2-9]; (iii) variation in the location and number
of rDNA sites in distinct chromosomal pairs [2-4,8,10];
and (iv) occurrence of natural triploidy in C. gomesi and
C. cf. zebra [6,10].
The first cytogenetic report in Characidium was for C.
zebra [11] and, so far, this is the only species where

heteromorphic sex chromosomes are absent [4,6,10].
Based on morphological analysis, C. zebra exhibits several plesiomorphic traits, being placed as basal in Characidium phylogeny [12]. The chromosomal characters of
C. zebra have already been referred to as putatively plesiomorphic for the genus [2]. Therefore, changes in the
karyotypes observed in other species of Characidium,
when compared with C. zebra, should be the result of
secondary chromosomal rearrangements.
The karyotypes of C. lauroi and C. alipioi have been
described, and while the latter was characterized by the
presence of a ZZ/ZW sex chromosome system, C. lauroi
was considered homomorphic because of the lack of differential heterochromatic bands [7]. However, further
comparative studies in seven species of this genus (C.
zebra, C. lanei, C. pterostictum, C. lauroi, C. oiticicai,
Characidium sp. and C. schubarti) showed that only C.
zebra lacked differentiated sex chromosomes and the
other species presented sex chromosomes in different
W-heterochromatin amplification stages and had terminal NORs on both Z and W chromosomes [4]. Characidium gomesi is another species with highly
differentiated sex chromosomes, bearing entirely heterochromatic W chromosomes and NORs on autosomes
[2,3,6].
A sex proto-chromosome pair for Characidium species was proposed, from which both Z and W chromosomes have evolved by structural rearrangements, such
as duplications, deletions, and/or inversions. By contrast,
the heterochromatin amplification of W was regarded as
a predominant event in the differentiation of the sex
chromosomal pair [2]. Later, it was inferred that the
NORs on ZW chromosomes in most species of

Characidium represented an ancestor state of sex protochromosomes, prior to heterochromatin amplification
[4]. Heterochromatin amplification in one of the sex
chromosomes driven by the accumulation of certain
repetitive DNA classes in one homologous is relatively
common in fish [13]. Such a process would favor
recombination suppression and thereby the independent
evolution of chromosomes or chromosomal regions
[14-17].
In the present study, we analyzed the origin, composition, and differentiation of sex and NOR-bearing chromosomes in populations of C. zebra, C. lauroi, and C.
gomesi, using chromosomal painting with a W-specific
probe from C. gomesi. We also mapped the 18S rDNA
to infer the evolution, phylogeny and biogeography of
the group.

Results
Populations of C. zebra from Passa Cinco River, Upper
Paraná basin (SP), C. lauroi from Grande stream, Paraíba
do Sul basin (SP), and C. gomesi from Grande River,
Upper Paraná basin (SP), Alambari stream, Tietê/Upper
Paraná basin (SP), Minhoca stream, São Francisco River
basin (MG), and Verde River, Tibagi River/Upper Paraná
basin (PR) have a conserved diploid number of 50 chromosomes, most of which are metacentric/submetacentric
(m/sm) (table 1). The populations of C. gomesi from Minhoca stream-MG and Verde River-PR are analyzed in the
present work for the first time, and showed a differentiated
ZZ/ZW system (Figure 1 and table 1). In both populations,
the Z chromosome is a medium-sized m chromosome carrying a proximal heterochromatin band on the long arms.
The W chromosome is an entirely heterochromatic m,

smaller than Z chromosome in specimens from Minhoca
stream (Figure 1c), whereas the W chromosome in the
population from Verde River is a heterochromatic subtelocentric (st) chromosome, slightly larger than Z (Figure 1d).
Therefore, the karyotype formulae differ between both
populations because of the morphological differences in
the W chromosome (Figure 1a, c and table 1).
DOP-PCR amplification of C-banded W chromosomes
from C. gomesi and hybridization of W probe onto the
metaphasic chromosomes of C. gomesi from Minhoca
stream and Verde River was highly efficient, revealing
positive signals at the terminal regions of some autosomes, at the proximal region on the long arms of the Z
chromosome, and the entire W chromosome (Figure 2a
and 2b).
Dual-color FISH using 18S rDNA and W probes
revealed distinctive patterns for each analyzed population. Thus, C. zebra, presented small sites related to the
W probe dispersed through the karyotype and an 18S
rDNA site in the sm pair 23 (Figure 3a and table 1).
Characidium lauroi presented 18S rDNA signals on the
heteromorphic m pair 2, regarded as the sex chromosomes in this species, and hybridization with the W
probe revealed weak signals dispersed on both the W
and Z chromosomes, in addition to some terminal autosomal regions (Figure 3b and table 1). The population
of C. gomesi from the Alambari stream showed 18S

Page 3 of 8

rDNA sites in the Z and W chromosomes, besides an
additional terminal site in homologous pair 19, exclusively for males (Figure 3c, d and table 1). The W probe
hybridized mainly on the proximal region of the Z chromosome and to almost the entire m W chromosome,
except for the NORs, besides on some minor terminal
sites in the autosomes (Figure 3c, d and table 1). Characidium gomesi from the Grande River and Minhoca
stream presented similar 18S rDNA signals in the sm
pair 17. The W probe hybridized mainly on the proximal region of the Z chromosome and the entire m W
chromosome, besides some small terminal sites on the
autosomes (Figure 3e, f, g and table 1). On the other
hand, C. gomesi from the Verde River showed six positive 18S rDNA sites. FISH with the W probe revealed
small terminal sites in some autosomes, besides a proximal site on the long arms of the Z chromosome and the
entire st W chromosome (Figure 3h, table 1).

Discussion
The karyotypic analysis

The populations of C. gomesi (Minhoca stream and
Verde River-analyzed for the first time in the present
work) are highly similar (2n = 50 chromosomes, moistly
m/sm) to other previously studied populations. Furthermore, although 32 m + 18 sm represents the most common karyotype in this group, chromosomal formulae

variations have already been reported, indicating that
some rearrangements, such as pericentric inversions,
might have taken place in the chromosomal diversification of this genus [2,4,5]. Nonetheless, in spite of the
apparent karyotype conservation, the populations of C.
gomesi have diversified mainly in the structure and morphology of their Z and W chromosomes and the number of major rDNA sites [2]. Amongst the several
analyzed populations of C. gomesi, only one showed
NORs located on sex chromosomes [5]. Therefore,
among the Characidium species bearing heteromorphic
sex chromosomes, only C. alipioi and C. gomesi (excepting the sample from the Alambari stream) have NORs
exclusively on autosomes, suggesting this is a derived
feature [4,5].
In general, it is hypothesized that sex chromosomes
evolved from a specific pair of autosomes carrying some
sex-determining gene(s). Subsequently, the newly
formed sex chromosomes stopped recombination in a
small region around the sex-determining locus [18]. Sex
chromosomes in this early stage of evolution are not
cytologically distinguishable (homomorphic). The process of recombination suppression then progressed
through almost the entire sex chromosome. The
exchange restraint between homologs during meiosis
could be caused by structural chromosomal rearrangements [19] or by the accumulation of certain repetitive
DNA classes in one homolog in the pair of sex protochromosomes [20,21]. The results obtained permit speculation concerning this sex chromosome differentiation.
Sex chromosomes and NOR differentiation in Characidium

Comparative chromosomal painting using the W-specific probe of C. gomesi demonstrated that the repetitive
DNAs present on sex chromosomes from different
populations of these species are highly conserved,
despite the morphological diversification of these chromosomes. In addition, the occurrence of W-specific

Page 4 of 8

sites on autosomes, albeit dispersed over terminal
regions in all analyzed populations/species, reveals that
the repetitive units that compose and differentiate the
sex chromosomes in Characidium are widespread in the
genus. This corroborates the hypothetical common origin of the ZZ/ZW system [2,5] and its monophyletic
status, giving rise to hypothesis of serial transformation
of these chromosomes within the genus Characidium.
Based on this scenario, it is possible to hypothesize
that the sex chromosomes of Characidium had a common origin and diversified in sequential stages (Figure
4). Therefore, the ancestor condition, without morphologically differentiated sex chromosomes, seems to be
present in C. zebra, with NORs located at the subterminal region of a small sm pair (23 rd ) and W-specific
regions dispersed at the terminal regions of some chromosomes (Figure 4, step 1).
The next step probably involved translocation of the
NOR to the 2nd m pair, bearing dispersed W-specific
sites, along with structural rearrangement of the pair
(pericentric inversion), size heteromorphism, and suppression of recombination during meiosis (Figure 4, step
2). This situation is found in the ZW pair of the C.
lauroi population analyzed in the present study. Supporting this hypothesis, other populations of C. lauroi
also presented NOR-bearing Z and W chromosomes
and showed a higher differentiation stage of sex chromosomes because of heterochromatin amplification [4].
Afterwards, gene erosion and heterochromatin amplification of the W chromosome would be more accentuated, leading to an accumulation of W-specific
sequences associated with the differentiation of morphological types of Z and W chromosomes reported among
species/populations of Characidium. Such a stage can
be visualized in the intermediary developmental stages
in C. lanei [9,17], or more advanced stages, such as
those as in the population of C. gomesi from the Alambari stream (Figure 4, step 3).
Simultaneously with the intense W heterochromatin
amplification, such as observed among populations of C.
gomesi (Grande River, Minhoca stream, Verde River)
and C. alipioi, new translocation events placed the
NORs on an autosomal sm pair (17th or 18th) (Figure 4,
step 4). The maintenance of NORs on sex chromosomes
in the population of C. gomesi (Alambari stream)
strongly suggests that NORs have undergone a novel
transposition in other populations, moving to an autosomal pair. This condition could be selectively favored by
avoiding the W heterochromatin amplification of some
populations, again reinforcing the common origin of the
ZW system in Characidium.
Even though NORs proved to be highly mobile in the
genomes of Characidium, most species present a single
NOR-bearing pair. Likewise, C. zebra, placed as basal in

populations of Characidium stained with DAPI. Bar = 10 μm.

Characidium phylogeny [12] shows a single NOR pair.
Only two populations of C. gomesi from Southern Brazil
were divergent, one from the Quebra Perna stream (PR)
bearing 10 ribosomal sites [2], and another from the
Verde River (PR) bearing six autosomal NORs (present
study), clearly representing derived and rare conditions
in this genus.
Biogeoghrapical features and interspecific divergence

The evolutionary history and the chromosomal diversification of Characidium are closely related to the isolation of populations in headwaters of distinct
hydrographic systems [2,4,5,7]. The main rivers in South

and Southeaster Brazil are currently separated by barriers to the dispersal of species and populations, favoring
isolation and gene flow restraints [22]. Thus, the populations were adapted to a particular environmental subset,
and the occurrence of small-sized species of limited spatial dispersal favor the fixation of interpopulation genetic
divergences [1]. Therefore, the karyotype structure and
differences in both morphology and composition of sex
chromosomes in Characidium could have been fixed
from the common ancestor of different species/populations (demonstrated in Figure 4), promoting inter- and
intraspecific variation and contributing to the speciation
process.

Conclusions
Comparative chromosomal painting using W-specific
and 18S rDNA probes in species/populations of Characidium, allowed us to infer the differentiation of sex and
NOR-bearing chromosomes in this group, gaining a better understanding of the chromosomal and biogeographic features acting on the population differentiation,
reproductive isolation, and speciation of this group.

The chromosomal preparations were obtained from
anterior kidney cells by an air-drying technique [23].
The metaphase chromosomes were conventionally
stained and C-banded [24] to determine diploid number,
chromosome formula, and heteromorphism of the sex
chromosomes prior to further analyses using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The procedures were
performed in compliance with the Ethics Committee on
Animal Experimentation (process number: 04741/08) of
the Universidade Estadual de Ponta Grossa (Brazil).
Chromosomal probes

Two probes were used to map regions/chromosomes in
Characidium species: (1) An 18S rDNA probe isolated
from the total DNA of Prochilodus argenteus [25] and;
(2) a W-specific probe of C. gomesi (population from
Minhoca stream, São Francisco River basin) isolated in
this study by microdissection of C-banded chromosomes
[17], here named the W probe.
Microdissection of the W chromosome in Characidium
gomesi and DOP-PCR

The W chromosomes of C. gomesi from Minhoca
stream, São Francisco River basin, (MG) were microdissected from C-banded metaphase chromosomes to allow
precise identification of sex chromosomes. The

Machado et al. BMC Genetics 2011, 12:65
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/12/65

chromosomal microdissections were carried out using
an inverted microscope IX51 (Olympus®) equipped with
a mechanical micromanipulator (Narishige ® ). Glass
capillaries of about 0.7 μm in diameter were prepared
using a micropipette puller (Narishige®) and were used
in the microdissection. Sixteen C-banded W chromosomes of C. gomesi were microdissected. The chromosomes were then transferred to a microtube and used in
(DOP-PCR). The DOP-PCR amplification [26] and the
changes procedures to C-banded chromosomes [17]
were used to obtain the W-probe. The DOP-PCR of C.
gomesi W chromosome consists of 1 × ThermoSequenase reaction buffer, 40 μM dNTPs and 2 μM DOP primer (5’ ccg act cga gnn nnn nat gtg g 3’). The
microtube was heated to 95°C for 10 min, followed by
the addition of 10 U of ThermoSequenase enzyme. The
first amplification is carried out through RAMP-PCR: 5
min 94°C; 12 cycles of low stringency (94°C 1 min and
30 s, 32°C 2 min, increasing 0.2°C/s until reaching 72°C
and 72°C 2 min); followed by 35 cycle of high stringency
(94°C 1 min and 30 s, 52°C 1 min and 30 s and 72°C 1
min and 30 s).
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)

FISH experiments were carried out in Characidium
representatives using 18S rDNA and W-chromosome
probes. The 18S rDNA probe was labeled by PCR using
16-dUTP-biotin (Roche® ). In this probe, the PCR mix
comprised 20 ng template, 1× Taq polymerase buffer (2
mM MgCl2), 40 μM of dATP, dGTP and dCTP, 28 μM
of dTTP, 12 μM of 16-dUTP biotin, 2 μM of each M13
primer and 0,05 U/μL of Taq polymerase. The W probe
was labeled by DOP-PCR using 11-dUTP digoxigenin
(Roche®). The PCR mix comprised 1x Taq polymerase
buffer (2 mM MgCl2), 40 μM of dATP, dGTP and dCTP,
28 μM of dTTP, 12 μM of 11-dUTP digoxigenin, 2 μM
of DOP primer, and 0,05 U/μL of Taq polymerase under
the following conditions: (1×) 94°C 5 min; (35×) 90°C 1
min and 30 s, 52°C 1 min and 30 s, 72°C 1 min and 30 s,
and (1×) 72°C 5 min. The FISH procedure [27] was performed under high stringency conditions (2.5 ng/μL of
each probe, 50% formamide, 2 × SSC, 10% dextran sulfate). Signal detection was accomplished using AlexaFluor-Streptavidin 488 (Molecular Probes ® ) and
antidigoxigenin-Rhodamine (Roche ® ) antibodies. The
chromosomes were counterstained with 4’,6’-diamino-2phenylindole (DAPI-0.2 μg/mL) in Vectashield mounting
medium (Vector ® ), and analyzed using an Olympus
BX41 epifluorescence microscope equipped with the DP
71 image capture system (Olympus®). The chromosomes
were organized into metacentric (m), submetacentric
(sm), and subtelocentric (st), according to arm ratio, and
arranged in decreasing order in the karyotype [28].
