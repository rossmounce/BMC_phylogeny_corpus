Abstract
Background: Huntington's disease is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder that is caused by
the expansion of an N-terminal polyQ stretch in the huntingtin protein. In order to investigate the
hypothesis that huntingtin was already involved in development of the nervous system in the last
common ancestor of chordates, we isolated and characterised the huntingtin homologue from the
amphioxus Branchiostoma floridae. In the present paper the amphioxus general term must be
referred to Branchiostoma floridae.
Results: In this report, we show that the exon-intron organization of the amphioxus huntingtin
gene is highly conserved with that of other vertebrates species. The AmphiHtt protein has two
glutamine residues in the position of the typical vertebrate polyQ tract. Sequence conservation is
greater along the entire length of the protein than in a previously identified Ciona huntingtin. The
first three N-terminal HEAT repeats are highly conserved in vertebrates and amphioxus, although
exon rearrangement has occurred in this region. AmphiHtt expression is detectable by in situ
hybridization starting from the early neurula stage, where it is found in cells of the neural plate. At
later stages, it is retained in the neural compartment but also it appears in limited and well-defined
groups of non-neural cells. At subsequent larval stages, AmphiHtt expression is detected in the
neural tube, with the strongest signal being present in the most anterior part.
Conclusion: The cloning of amphioxus huntingtin allows to infer that the polyQ in huntingtin was
already present 540 million years ago and provides a further element for the study of huntingtin
function and its evolution along the deuterostome branch.

Background
Huntingtin is a completely soluble, ubiquitously
expressed 350-kDa protein of 3144 aa which, once
mutated, causes Huntington's disease (HD), a late-onset
neurodegenerative disease characterised by movement

disorders, dementia and psychiatric disturbances, and by
preferential vulnerability of striatal and cortical neurons
[1].

One obviously important portion of the mammalian protein is the polyQ tract, which is present in the normal protein with up to 36 glutamines, but becomes further
elongated in the mutant protein as a consequence of the
DNA CAG triplet repeat expansion in the gene [1]. The
role of the polyQ region in huntingtin's physiological
function is currently unknown in mammals. The polyQ
tract is found in many transcription factors [2] and, in
huntingtin, is followed by a recently discovered polyP
tract that may give it structural and biochemical advantages [3]. Recent studies have suggested that the polyP
tract helps to maintain protein solubility [4]. It is also possible that, during evolution, an expanded polyQ has conferred important molecular function(s) partially because
of its cooperation with the emerging polyP tract. An aberrantly expanded polyQ region in huntingtin is sufficient
to cause HD.
Investigating the physiological functions of huntingtin
involves a number of difficulties, there is a biological evidence indicating that the protein has individual beneficial
activities in the brain (e.g. it is anti-apoptic and neuroprotective) [5]. Its primary amino acid sequence reveals little
about its function because it is unlike any other known
protein and contains only a few known sequence motifs.
However, it does have HEAT repeat consensa (approximately 40-amino-acid-long sequences that occur multiple
times) [6,7], whose presence indicates an ability to participate in multiple protein-protein interaction networks, as
it has been further documented in subsequent studies [8].
However, the presence of these domains does not allow a
complete definition of its biological function(s). Furthermore, the influence of the evolution of the HEAT repeats
is far from being established and a more thorough knowledge of their presence in non-vertebrate huntingtin may
help us to understand their role in the mammalian protein.
In the absence of information about its three-dimensional
structure, comparisons of huntingtin homologues should
help to define conserved or newly emergent functional
domains in mammalian cells, although only limited
information is available about huntingtin in other species. Furthermore, the comparative expression and distribution of huntingtin mRNA in different organisms may
be instructive as to its role in mammals. As huntingtin
homologues in the vertebrate subphylum are highly conserved, whereas Drosophila melanogaster huntingtin
diverges substantially (particularly in its N-terminal portion and the absence of the polyQ-rich region) [9], we
have recently concentrated our study on the cloning and
comparative analysis of invertebrate deuterostome homologues, such as ascidians [10], echinoderms [11; Tartari et
al., unpublished] and, as described in this paper, amphioxus. These molecules may share similar (but not identi-

cal) functions to those of the human protein and may
help in reconstructing the evolution of huntingtin.
Before this study, some of us studied a complete huntingtin gene from the ascidians C. intestinalis and C. savigny
[10] and found that Ciona huntingtin contains regions
that have specifically evolved in this genus and are concentrated in the central part of the protein, whereas major
differences in the N-terminal part indicate the more recent
evolution of this group-specific portion of the protein.
Furthermore, C. intestinalis huntingtin transcript exhibits
an alternative splicing in the 3' coding region and in the
3'UTR [10]. One further characteristic of ascidian huntingtin is the complete absence of the polyQ-rich region,
whereas polyQ is described for the first time in zebrafish
huntingtin that contains a QQQQ tract [12].
A partial huntingtin sequence is available from two sea
urchin species [11], which shows that their nervous system organisation is profoundly different from that of
chordates [13-15]. In situ hybridisation, using a probe
from the 3' region of the sea urchin Heliocidaris erythrogramma huntingtin homologue, has shown that huntingtin expression is confined to non-neuronal compartments
[11]. A similar experiment using the ascidian Halocynthia
roretzi showed ubiquitous expression of the huntingtin
homologue as in vertebrates [11]. On the contrary, vertebrate huntingtin is expressed throughout life and in all tissues, but it is particularly enriched in brain, suggesting
that it may play a particular role in this district. Consistently, there is now considerable genetic and biological
evidence indicating that huntingtin is important for the
formation and maintenance of brain neurons, as it contributes to neuronal survival, neuronal gene expression
and BDNF production [16].
Taking advantage of the newly available data from amphioxus B. floridae genome sequencing, we here describe the
cloning of amphioxus huntingtin (AmphiHtt), coming
from an invertebrate chordate whose phylogenetic node
of divergence is thought to go back 540 million years,
while Ciona seems to have diverged more recently [17-19].
We also describe for the first time the distribution of huntingtin mRNA in this invertebrate chordate, whose nervous
system development is particularly close to that of vertebrates as it includes vertebrate-like anatomical characteristics such as a dorsal nerve cord, a notochord and
segmentally arranged muscles.
We show that AmphiHtt protein has two glutamines in
the same polyQ tract position of vertebrate homologues,
thus suggesting that polyQ was already present 540 million years ago. We also report that the primary sequence
around the QQ is highly conserved with respect to vertebrates and that sequence conservation along the entire

length of the protein is greater than in C. intestinalis huntingtin. The first three N-terminal HEAT repeats are highly
conserved in vertebrates and amphioxus, although exon
rearrangement has occurred in this region. We also show
that amphioxus huntingtin is not exclusively neural, but
mainly enriched in the neural compartment; this is a clear
indication that huntingtin, in amphioxus, at least within
the analyzed developmental stages, could have a specific
neuronal function.

Results
Cloning and characterisation of the amphioxus huntingtin
sequence (AmphiHtt)
Starting from the recently available B. floridae genomic
sequencing data, two scaffolds were identified by means
of TblastN similarity as possibly containing the huntingtin gene. A first messenger prediction was produced and
used to design eight primer pairs (Figure 1 and Additional
file 1). PCR assays with first-strand adult cDNA and a 5- to
24-hour B. floridae embryos cDNA library as templates,
yielded eight overlapping clones that constituted the coding sequence of an amphioxus huntingtin gene, AmphiHtt.
The AmphiHtt cDNA sequence (deposited in GenBank:
Accession No. EF210456) is 9293 bp long and contains a
putative 2972 bp open reading frame encoding a 3090
amino acid protein; an in-frame stop codon upstream

from the putative start codon was found at 9 bp, and a
stop codon at 9291 bp.
Sequence similarity analysis of the entire huntingtin
sequences of several chordates (Figure 2A) showed that
the amphioxus sequence has 46% percent identity with
mammals, 46–48% with fish, and 34% with Ciona,
whereas Ciona proteins have only 34–36% identity with
vertebrate huntingtin. Furthermore, additional analysis
led to the calculation of a 124–127 aa divergence between
Ciona and vertebrates (Figure 2A), but only an 80–83 aa
divergence between amphioxus and vertebrates (Figure
2A). Multiple sequence alignments were generated and
huntingtin phylogenetic trees were constructed (Figure
2B, Additional files 2 and 3).
The results obtained using these methodologies indicate
that AmphiHtt is more similar to vertebrate huntingtin
than to Ciona proteins, which apparently conflicts with
the current view that tunicates are the sister group of vertebrates [17-19] (probably likely due to the generally high
rates of evolution of the tunicate genome [20] with longbranch attraction as a biasing factor in their phylogenetic
position).
Qualitatively, the AmphiHtt sequence has two glutamines
(Q17 and Q18) at the corresponding position to polyQ in
vertebrates (Figure 3), whereas Ciona huntingtin has an
aromatic amino acid group in this position. Amphioxus is
therefore the first known non-vertebrate species to contain glutamine residues in huntingtin, thus dating the
presence of glutamine in a non-vertebrate contest and
indicating that the common ancestor of cephalochordates
and vertebrates already possessed this characteristic. The
polyP tract is only present in mammalian huntingtin and
absent in non-mammalian vertebrates, Ciona huntingtin
and AmphiHtt. In addition, the first 17 amino acids of
AmphiHtt, with its three lysines that have been shown to
participate in determining the intracellular distribution of
the protein between the cytoplasm and nucleus in vertebrates [21], are also strongly conserved (Figure 3).
Finally, in order to look at a variability in the polyQ tract
and at a somatic instability, we carried out a BLAST search
of the NCBI amphioxus dbEST and Trace-Archives databases using AmphiHtt cDNA sequence as a query. No
matching EST sequences were found. Furthermore, all
shot gun sequences covering the polyQ tract confirmed
the exclusive presence of two glutamines residues and
consequently the absence of a somatic instability.
We next searched for AmphiHtt HEAT repeats by applying
the REP program to the AmphiHtt sequence (Figure 4,
Tables 1 and 2). HEAT repeats are bioinformatic consensa
present in vertebrate huntingtin that may have molecular

activity. We therefore applied the score of the consensus,
sequence similarity and relative position of the HEATs in
a multiple alignment (containing a good number of
informative protein sequences) in order to evaluate the
most possible functionally active HEATs. Although this
evaluation may need to be revised in the future, we found

that the program identified six highly scored HEAT-AAA

previously published consensa in human huntingtin
[6,7,10], whereas the contrary, none of the consensa specific to the central part of the Ciona homologue (aa
867–905 and aa 1341–1378), seems to have a correspondent in amphioxus. Numbering the HEAT consensa
of human huntingtin [10] from the N-terminal to the Cterminal end, the sequence and position of the first three
amino terminal human HEAT repeats are very well conserved in AmphiHtt (Figure 4, Tables 1 and 2), as are the
ninth and eleventh in the central region, and the fifteenth
in the C-terminal portion. Amphioxus seems to have one
HEAT consensus at aa 306–344 that has no correspondence in human huntingtin, although a similar sequence
can be found in Ciona huntingtin. An opposite situation
can be established for the fourteenth human HEAT, which
seems to have a correspondent only in amphioxus and
not in Ciona, whereas the fifteenth seems to be specifically
lost in Ciona. Finally, two additional consensa (add1 and
add2, see Tables 1 and 2) in the C-terminal portion of
Ciona huntingtin (aa 2771–2809, aa 2864–2904) met a
possible correspondence in both amphioxus (aa
2927–2965, aa 3020–3059) and human huntingtin.
Genomic organisation of the huntingtin gene: a
comparative overview
The AmphiHtt cDNA sequence was superimposed on the
genomic sequence available at JGI, and it was found that
the genomic coordinates for the AmphiHtt cDNAs were
from 29810 nt to 81840 nt in scaffold_613 (minus
strand), and from 685048 nt to 743806 nt in scaffold_378
(plus strand). Taking advantage of the newly cloned
cDNA sequence, we reconstructed the genomic organisation of the huntingtin gene in both scaffolds using two
genomic mapping software programs: GMAP and Wise2.

The amphioxus huntingtin gene contains 63 exons and
spans a genomic region of over 50 kb, whereas vertebrate
sequences have 67 exons and corresponding gene lengths
ranging from 80 Kb (fishes) to 180 Kb (humans), and
Ciona has 61 coding exons covering a genomic region of
33 kb [10]. The predicted sequence of our AmphiHtt corresponded with minor polymorphisms to the coding
sequences predicted from the two genomic scaffolds. Nevertheless, as the two scaffolds have some assembly errors
and several tandem repeat elements (deduced using the
Tandem repeats Finder program, [22]), the information
on exons 36 and 37 comes from the scaffold_613, and
that on exon 57 from the scaffold_378 (Figure 5 and Additional file 4). Furthermore, in this preliminary genomic
assembly, the information in some intron sequences is
not conclusive but seems to match our exon mRNA data
perfectly: 60 exons are correctly recognised in both scaffolds. We therefore suggest that there is only a single copy
gene of huntingtin in the amphioxus genome, and that
the two scaffolds represent the two alleles of the same
gene.
Comparison of the genomic and cDNA sequences of
AmphiHtt allowed us to determine its exon/intron structure, and to compare it to what is known for members of
the same family in other chordates. Furthermore, analysis
of the pattern of exon-intron junctions can provide
important insights into the evolution of huntingtin genes.
In particular, as shown in Figure 5, we compared the

Figure 5 organisation of the huntingtin gene from B. floridae, H. sapiens and C. intestinalis
Genomic
Genomic organisation of the huntingtin gene from B. floridae, H. sapiens and C. intestinalis. Introns are represented by
broken lines and exons by coloured boxes. All of the corresponding introns are indicated as black/blue dashed lines. The base-pair
length of each exon is indicated inside the boxes. The numbers above the coloured boxes represent the exon numbering. Bracketed red numbers correspond to the common intron phase; the different intron phase is indicated by bracketed black numbers.
Black dots label the exons coming from scaffold_613 and an orange dot shows the exon deduced from scaffold_378. Only the protein coding sequence was considered for the reconstruction of the genomic organisation. The diagram is not drawn to scale. See

lines outlined in blue in Figure 5), five of which are indicated as red box when the number of exons is the same in
both species; whereas the other five exon-clusters have
more exons in Homo sapiens than in amphioxus (grey
boxes), and the remaining four show the opposite situation (yellow boxes) (Figure 5). Otherwise, Ciona has 23
orthologous exons (black boxes) and 17 exon-clusters
(pink boxes) (Figure 5).

The AmphiHtt gene has a highly conserved distribution of
exons and introns with respect to the human sequence
(Figure 5), and a length range of 60–457 bp that does not
substantially differ from that of the human gene (48–341
bp). The exon/intron splice sites in AmphiHtt correspond
to the expected GT-AG intron consensus splicing
sequences; the intron phases in AmphiHtt are identical to
those in the human gene with the exception of intron 36

(Figure 5); and the majority of introns are in phase 0. In
particular, the AmphiHtt gene shares with the human
huntingtin gene 28 phase 0, 10 phase 1 and 12 phase 2
introns, thus indicating a more conserved gene structure
than the Ciona gene homologue, that has 18 phase 0, 8
phase 1 and 6 phase 2 introns (Figure 5).
In conclusion, on the basis of such analysis, we found
that: i) the exon-intron organisation of the huntingtin
gene is remarkably conserved in the phylum Chordata, as
both amphioxus and Ciona huntingtin genes have a very
similar genomic organisation to that of other vertebrate
species; ii) at least four reduction events in exon numbers
(yellow exon-clusters) occurred between the amphioxus
and human genes, which are preferentially located at the
3' end and in the central region of the gene, whereas
greater exon acquisition has mainly occurred in the 5' end.
This confirms previous observations that the greater exon
acquisition corresponds to a larger difference in the N-terminal part of the protein between human and Ciona huntingtin [9]. However, the genomic organisation of the
amphioxus huntingtin gene is more similar to that of vertebrates than to Ciona, including the larger number of
positionally conserved introns (51 in amphioxus against
39 in Ciona), the smaller number of exon-clusters (14 in
amphioxus against 17 in Ciona), and the conservation of
intron phases. These differences could be also explained
by a high evolutionary rate such as that observed in tunicate species.
AmphiHtt expression in amphioxus
Analyses of huntingtin expression in vertebrates have provided limited information concerning its potential physiological function as the protein is expressed ubiquitously
and throughout the entire life of a vertebrate. A first
attempt to evaluate huntingtin distribution in an invertebrate organism was made by Kauffman et al. [11], and we
tested the expression of AmphiHtt mRNA during amphioxus development. Amphioxus and vertebrates share anatomical features such as a dorsal nerve cord, a notochord,
segmentally arranged muscles (myomeres), pharyngeal
gill slits and a post-anal tail (see Figure 6).

We performed whole mount in situ hybridisation on B.
floridae developmental stages of 0–10 hours, 11-hour
early neurula, 15-hour late neurula, 18-hour late neurula,
24-hour early larva, and 48-hour larva. In order to
increase our confidence in the results (the presence of possible alternative transcripts that may be differentially
expressed and that are not identified in the present work)
we used three different >1000 bp probes mapping to the
5', central and 3' portions of the messengers. We obtained
the same results using both mixed probes and one probe
at a time in separate experiments.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/7/127

No detectable transcripts of AmphiHtt were found
between fertilisation and gastrula stage (0–10 hrs) (data
not shown). The first visible expression was found at the
most anterior neural plate of 11-hour early neurula (Figure 7A). At this stage, the AmphiHtt transcripts are mainly
located at the anterior tip of the neural plate (Figures 7A
and 7B), and in some more posterior cells at the neural
plate borders (Figures 7A and 7C). As neurulation proceeds and the neural tube forms by the dorsal folding of
the lateral edges of the neural plate, AmphiHtt expression
extends along the antero-posterior axis of 15-hour neurula. At this stage, neural expression is found in the entire
cerebral vesicle and in the most anterior two-thirds of the
neural tube (Figure 7D).
In order to reveal differences in dorso-ventral distribution,
we used cross-sections of the same embryo (15-hour neurula) and found transcripts in some ventrolateral (Figures
7E–G) and dorsolateral cells of the cerebral vesicle (Figure
7F), at the level of the precursor of the frontal eye complex
and the infundibular organ. More posteriorly, we found
labelled ventrolateral nerve cells of the hindbrain (Figures
7H–J), most of which consisted of paired neural cells
located ventrolaterally in the neural tube and may correspond to differentiating DC motoneurons that innervate
the dorsal compartment of the myomeres [23,24]. Furthermore, at the 15-hour stage (early neurula), non-neural
expression appears in some endodermal cells of the tail
bud around the neuroenteric canal (Figures 7D and 7K),
and in some cells of Hatschek's left diverticulum (Figures
7D and 7G). Neural tube expression is strongly maintained in late neurulae (18 hours), and new labelling
appears in individual somite cells, which were only
detected at the 18-hour late neurula stage, mainly confined between somite 3 and somite 10, and sometimes
arranged as a row of cells at the most lateral margins of the
somites, just near the epidermic layer (Figures 7N–S). At
the 24-hour early larval stage, the expression was found in
the neural tube (Figures 8A–H), being localised to some
cells of the cerebral vesicle (Figures 8A–E) and cells of the
most anterior two-thirds of the neural tube (Figures
8A,B,F,G). AmphiHtt-expressing cells can also be seen in
the ventro-lateral position of the neural tube, just behind
the first pigment spot (Figure 8H). This pattern of expression is essentially maintained in the later stages of development (48-hour larva) (Figures 8I–P), but the highest
expression of AmphiHtt mRNA is found at the level of the
cerebral vesicle (Figures 8J–M).
In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that during
amphioxus development huntingtin transcripts are
detected into the neuronal compartment starting from
early neurula stage. Except for endodermal (tail bud) and
mesodermal structures (Hatschek's left diverticulum and
somites) (i.e. non neuronal cells in the 15- to 18-hour

Schematic diagram of a B. floridae larva showing some of the details useful for following AmphiHtt expression.
Upper panel: Longitudinal view of an amphioxus larva (green: nervous system; yellow: notochord; pink: gut endoderm). The central nervous system has homologues of at least three major vertebrate brain subdivisions: the fore-, mid-, and hindbrain. The cerebral vesicle (cv) can be subdivided into rostral (A, anterior) and caudal (P, posterior) parts, and only corresponds to the
diencephalic region of the vertebrate forebrain (FB) because it lacks of a telencephalic region [43]. The anterior part of the cerebral vesicle consists of the frontal eye complex (fe), characterised by a cluster of pigmented epithelial cells (pigment cup) and four
rows of neurons [44]. The posterior part begins with the infundibular cells (if) that are responsible for producing Reissner's fibres
in amphioxus and it is homologous to a vertebrate diencephalic region corresponding to the subcommisural organ [45]. Beginning
near the front of the posterior cerebral vesicle, the lamellar body (lb), a putative homologue of the vertebrate pineal eye (epiphysis) [43], is located dorsally. This is followed by a midbrain-like region (MB), including the tectal zone extending from the posterior
part of the lamellar body to the anterior part of the primary motor centre (pmc), and then a hindbrain-like region (HB), that starts
from the posterior part of the pmc and extends caudally over the first pigment spot (ps), has an uncertain posterior limit (?)
[46,47]. Some non neuronal structures are indicated: hld, Hatchek's left diverticulum; s, somites; tb, tail-bud. A grey triangle indicates the expression gradient of AmphiHtt from the most anterior part to approximately two-thirds of the neural tube. Lower

stages), the expression of AmphiHtt mRNA follows an
antero-posterior gradient, and is enriched in the anterior
neural tube. This result could reflect a specific neuronal
function of huntingtin in the middle and later developmental stages of this non-vertebrate organism. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude that in situ hybridization, being a
relatively insensitive techniques, do not allow us to detect
low levels of messengers in the early developmental stages
and in non nervous structures of amphioxus larvae.

Discussion
In order to increase our understanding of normal huntingtin function(s) and reconstruct polyQ evolution along
the deuterostome branch as an indication of possible pro-

tein activity, we have recently concentrated our study on
the cloning and comparative analysis of non-vertebrate
deuterostome homologues, such as ascidians [10], echinoderms (Tartari et al., unpublished) and amphioxus.
Amphioxus shares the full suite of chordate characteristics
with vertebrates and the nerve cord has dorso-ventral specialisation, but they lack the vertebrate typically extensive
subcellular and tissue specialisation of the nervous system. At genetic level, amphioxus did not undergo the
extensive gene duplication events that characterise vertebrate genomes [25,26], possibly lacking the newlyacquired gene innovation of vertebrates. All of these characteristics make this organism particularly useful to infer

features that were already present in the last common
ancestor of chordates.
Along the deuterostome branch, the recently cloned ascidian huntingtin homologue [10], whose sequence conservation is greater than that of Drosophila, suggests a more
recent evolution of the 5' end of the gene, which is also
characterised by the lack of a polyQ tract. Only partial
sequences are available from other invertebrates in the
deuterostome branch, such the tunicate Halocynthia
roretzi, and from two echinoderms, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and Heliocidaris erythrogramma, for which no
extensive details of sequence conservation are known
[11].
Huntingtin cloning from amphioxus allowed us to discover an evolutionarily ancient point of emergence of the
polyQ tract similar to that characterising huntingtin in
vertebrates. AmphiHtt protein has two glutamines in the
same position of the polyQ tract as that characterising the

entire vertebrate subphylum. This indicates that a double
Q was present in last common ancestor between cephalochordates and vertebrates, and that Ciona has differently
and subsequently lost this characteristic.
A further biochemical indication of the possible molecular activity of the protein is the presence of HEAT repeat
consensa. The AmphiHtt protein has 11 HEAT repeats,
thus falling between the 8 of C. intestinalis and the 17 of
human huntingtin. Our analyses identified the most conserved HEATs (the first three in the N-terminus, the ninth
and eleventh in the central region, and the fifteenth in the
C-terminus) in a homologue that precedes vertebrate
genome duplication. Although this does not yet allow us
to confirm a HEAT repeat-dependent evolutionary trend
in huntingtin, or the impact of these sequences on protein
function, we can report the strong maintenance of HEATs
at the extreme N-terminus.

With respect to human huntingtin, conservation of the
primary amino acid sequence in the remaining amphioxus protein is greater than that in C. intestinalis, and comparison of the gene structure of AmphiHtt and the human
and ascidian homologues shows that the gene and exon
boundaries are more conserved with respect to vertebrates
than the ascidian huntingtin gene. This suggests that
amphioxus huntingtin is closer to, and less divergent from
vertebrate huntingtin than ascidian huntingtin, and leads
us to hypothesise that its function is possibly also closer
to that of vertebrate huntingtin.

emergence of a role of huntingtin in the nervous system
(at least during development) as amphioxus huntingtin
messenger RNA is enriched in neuronal tissues.

In particular, as exon acquisition events are mainly
located in the 5' portion of the gene, whereas the extreme
N-terminal portion of AmphiHtt is highly conserved at
protein level, we suggest that huntingtin refined its possible N-terminal corresponding function in the evolutionary transition between cephalochordates and vertebrates,
and we postulate that this function can be linked to the

The complete cloning of AmphiHtt also allowed us to analyse its expression in the embryonic and larval stages of
amphioxus, and may help in inferring hypothesis on possible huntingtin function.

First expression analysis on deuterostome invertebrates
the echinoderm H. erythrogramma and the ascidian H.
roretzi [11], suggests an ubiquitous expression of huntingtin mRNA at all developmental stages of ascidian (as in
vertebrates), and a non-neuronal signal in echinoderms.
Moreover, by RT-PCR Drosophila huntingtin transcripts
were found in all developmental stages [9].

The pattern of huntingtin expression in amphioxus substantially differs from that at the corresponding stages of

vertebrate development. It is mainly limited to the neuronal compartments from 11-hour neurula to 48-hour larva,
and is not detectable at the early developmental stages
until the gastrula stage, whereas it seems to be widely
expressed in vertebrates. In humans, rodents and pigs,
huntingtin is ubiquitously expressed but has the highest
levels in brain and testis, followed by lung, heart, kidney
and liver. Even lower vertebrates (fish) seem to express
huntingtin at all developmental stages and in all tissues,
particularly in the head of adults [12].
Huntingtin does not seem to be expressed until the end of
gastrulation in amphioxus. Although this finding cannot
exclude the possibility of simply undetectable low messenger levels, it is possible that, unlike in vertebrates,
huntingtin may not be required for gastrulation in this
organism. Mammalian data indicate that huntingtin is
required at different stages of development, and that its
total absence causes embryo lethality at the gastrulation
stage [27-29]. However, amphioxus embryos differ from
mammalian embryos in early gastrulation insofar as they
have a double-layered gastrula (ectoderm and mesoendoderm) instead of the three-layered vertebrate gastrula
(ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm) [30].
As mammalian embryogenesis proceeds, huntingtin is
required for epiblast formation and neurogenesis [31].
Finally, the removal of huntingtin from post-natal neurons causes cell death, which indicates that mammalian
huntingtin plays an important role in nervous system formation and neuronal survival in adulthood. In any case,
the expression of mammalian huntingtin is always ubiquitous at all these stages of development.
Closer analysis of amphioxus huntingtin expression in the
nervous system shows an initial homogeneous localisation in the most anterior two-thirds of the neural tube,
where the signal seems to become more intense at later
stages of development [48 hours), thus indicating a possible antero-posterior gradient. This suggests that amphioxus huntingtin may play a role in events occurring at the
time of neurogenesis.
In addition, serial cross-sections of whole-mounted
labelled amphioxus embryos, showing dorso-ventral
views of specific neural tube regions, revealed the presence of huntingtin throughout the most anterior cerebral
vesicle, whereas it was restricted ventrally to the posterior
cerebral vesicle. Moving caudally, huntingtin specifically
marks some paired ventro-lateral cells in the hindbrain
that can be assumed to be dorsal compartment (DC)
motor neurons and, even more caudally (after the first
pigment spot), huntingtin transcripts preferentially localise dorso-laterally in the neural tube. This is the first evi-

of

Conclusion
We have recently hypothesised that the different functions
of huntingtin during mammalian development may possibly reflect evolutionary steps in the protein and that its
early non-neuronal activity in mammals can be likened to
its ancestral function in species with a poorly organised or
no nervous system [5]. In this study, we found that the
sequence of amphioxus huntingtin is not critically different from that of vertebrates, and that its expression is particularly enriched in the nervous system. In this view, it
can be inferred that an ancestral neuronal function of
huntingtin was present 540 millions years ago. The differences in the length of the polyQ tract between amphioxus
and vertebrates suggest that the function of huntingtin
may have evolved different biochemical properties in
both lineages. In particular, we argue that the domain(s)
involved in these ancestral function(s) are positioned in
the extreme N-terminal portion as the protein's primary
sequence and the consensa of secondary structures (HEAT
repeats) are highly conserved with respect to vertebrate
huntingtin, and because the corresponding 5' portion of
the gene seems to be due to more recent evolution.

Methods
Animal collection and RNA preparation
Ripe specimens of the Florida amphioxus (Branchiostoma
floridae) were collected in Old Tampa Bay, FL. Animals
were induced to spawn by electric stimulation. Eggs
obtained from electrically stimulated females were fertilized, and the developmental stages were raised in laboratory culture. Adult specimens were harvested and
immediately submerged in RNA later (Ambion Europe
Ltd., UK). Total RNA from a single adult was extracted
using the TRIzol LS reagent (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA).
Following extraction, RNA was treated with RNAse-free
DNAse I (Ambion Europe Ltd., UK) according to the manufacturer's recommendations in order to digest contaminating genomic DNA. First-strand cDNA was synthesised
with 5 μg RNA using the SuperScript first-strand synthesis
system (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and oligo(dT) primers.
Retrieving sequence from the Branchiostoma floridae
genome
The B. floridae genome assembly (v1.0) was searched at
JGI [32] using the TblastN algorithm and several vertebrate huntingtin protein sequences as queries. The identified sequences were analysed by means of two gene
prediction programs (GenomeScan [33], GENSCAN [34])
in order to correct the preliminary annotation reported at
JGI (Protein ID: 101261, 101262 and 252341). Then, a
predicted coding sequence for the amphioxus huntingtin

gene was used to define the PCR amplification strategy
(Figure 1). Finally, we reconstructed the genomic organisation of the amphioxus huntingtin gene using two
genomic mapping software programs: GMAP [35] and
Wise2 [36], which respectively re-align messengers and
protein to genomic sequences.
Cloning of AmphiHtt mRNA
The resulting first-strand cDNA of adult amphioxus B. floridae and a 5- to 24-hour B. floridae embryo cDNA library
(kindly provided by Jim Langeland) were used in PCR
assays with specific primers designed on the basis of the
predicted coding sequence. PCRs were carried out in a 50
μl reaction mixture using the Hot Master mix in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Eppendorf Srl,
Italy) and the primers specified in Additional file 1. The
PCR products (Figure 1) were directly cloned using a
TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Ten
clones for each amplified fragment were randomly chosen
for automated sequencing using a 377 PerkinElmer
sequencer and the universal or internal sequence-specific
primers.
Sequence and phylogenetic analysis
The Vector NTI Suite (version 9.0, Informax, North
Bethesda, MD) software package was used for sequence
analysis. Multiple sequence alignments were carried out
using the huntingtin sequences from Homo sapiens
(P42858), Mus musculus (P42859), Rattus norvegicus
(P51111), Sus scrofa (BAA36752), Danio rerio
(AAC63983), Fugu rubripes (P51112), Tetraodon negroviridis (CAG03293), and Ciona intestinalis (AM162277).
We also used the sequences of Xenopus tropicalis, Gallus gallus and Ciona savigny predicted from genomic sequences
by Gissi et al. [10]. The amino acid sequences from amphioxus and eleven other species were aligned using the
CLUSTAL W program [37] and manually corrected.
Amino acid sites with gaps in any sequence were excluded,
and so a total of 2491 characters were considered for the
analysis. The best-fitting model of evolution (JTT, with an
estimated alpha parameter to 0.73 and a gamma distribution of rates between sites of 4.0) was inferred by means
of the ProtTest [38]. Phylogenetic analysis was performed
using a fast and accurate maximum likelihood heuristic
method (PHYML v2.4.4) [39] starting from the BIONJ
tree, under the parameters estimated by ProtTest. Tree stability was assessed by means of a bootstrap analysis with
100 cycles. Phylogenetic analysis was also performed by
CLUSTAL W program and MEGA version 3.1 [40] (Additional file 3). The tree was produced using the neighborjoining method with Poisson correction and complete
deletion of gaps and bootstrapped 1000 times. Such tree
was rooted using the huntingtin from D. melanogaster
(AF146362) as the outgroup. The phylogenetic trees were
visualised using TREEVIEW. The sequence data were also

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/7/127

analyzed using the MEGALIGN program from LASERGENE (DNASTAR, Madison, WI) in order to evaluate
sequence similarities in the huntingtin proteins (Figure
2A).
HEAT repeat evolution analysis
HEAT repeat consensa were found by searching for the
HEAT option with the REP program [41], and loading the
individual human, amphioxus and Ciona intestinalis huntingtin amino acid sequences. The resulting highly scored
consensa were listed, and additional human consensa previously published by Gissi et al. [10] were added to the
list. By applying the REP program and searching the all
consensa option, additional low-score HEAT consensa
were found in the three sequences. Therefore, we considered and listed only those corresponding to our multiple
alignment (Additional file 2, Tables 1 and 2).
Whole mount in situ hybridisation
To obtain riboprobes for whole mount in situ hybridisation, PCR was performed using adult amphioxus cDNA as
a template and the HttA_F and HttA_R primers (Figure 1
and Additional file 1, probe A). The resulting 1345-bp
fragment was subcloned into the pCR II TOPO vector
(Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), and the orientation of the
cloned fragments was confirmed by DNA sequencing.
Two further riboprobes were prepared using the Htt5 and
Htt7 cDNA clones (Figure 1 and Additional file 1, probe B
and probe C). Both sense and antisense RNA probes were
generated using a digoxigenin (DIG) RNA labelling kit
(Roche Diagnostics, Canada) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. In order to detect AmphiHtt
mRNA the probes were used singly and mixed in different
experiments. The in situ hybridisation experiments were
performed at different developmental stages from fertilisation to 48-hour larvae according to Holland et al. [42].
Labelled whole mount embryos were photographed using
an Olympus IX71 microscope (Olympus Italia s.r.l., Italy),
and then counterstained with 1% Ponceau S in 1% acetic
acid, dehydrated in ethanol, embedded in Spurr's resin,
and serially sectioned at 3–4 μm. Moreover, samples were
also examined without Ponceau S counterstaining in
order to avoid masking of possible low-level signals. The
signal was identical using single or mixed probes, but we
only show the results obtained with the mixed probes
because the signal was more intense. Negative control
experiments were done using sense riboprobes and no
specific signal was obtained (Additional file 5).
