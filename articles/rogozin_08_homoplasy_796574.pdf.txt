Abstract
Background: Rare genomic changes (RGCs) that are thought to comprise derived shared characters of individual clades are
becoming an increasingly important class of markers in genome-wide phylogenetic studies. Recently, we proposed a new type
of RGCs designated RGC_CAMs (after Conserved Amino acids-Multiple substitutions) that were inferred using genome-wide
identification of amino acid replacements that were: i) located in unambiguously aligned regions of orthologous genes, ii) shared
by two or more taxa in positions that contain a different, conserved amino acid in a much broader range of taxa, and iii) require
two or three nucleotide substitutions. When applied to animal phylogeny, the RGC_CAM approach supported the coelomate
clade that unites deuterostomes with arthropods as opposed to the ecdysozoan (molting animals) clade. However, a nonnegligible level of homoplasy was detected.
Results: We provide a direct estimate of the level of homoplasy caused by parallel changes and reversals among the
RGC_CAMs using 462 alignments of orthologous genes from 19 eukaryotic species. It is shown that the impact of parallel
changes and reversals on the results of phylogenetic inference using RGC_CAMs cannot explain the observed support for the
Coelomata clade. In contrast, the evidence in support of the Ecdysozoa clade, in large part, can be attributed to parallel changes.
It is demonstrated that parallel changes are significantly more common in internal branches of different subtrees that are
separated from the respective common ancestor by relatively short times than in terminal branches separated by longer time
intervals. A similar but much weaker trend was detected for reversals. The observed evolutionary trend of parallel changes is
explained in terms of the covarion model of molecular evolution. As the overlap between the covarion sets in orthologous genes
from different lineages decreases with time after divergence, the likelihood of parallel changes decreases as well.
Conclusion: The level of homoplasy observed here appears to be low enough to justify the utility of RGC_CAMs and other
types of RGCs for resolution of hard problems in phylogeny. Parallel changes, one of the major classes of events leading to
homoplasy, occur much more often in relatively recently diverged lineages than in those separated from their last common
ancestor by longer time intervals of time. This pattern seems to provide the molecular-evolutionary underpinning of Vavilov's
law of homologous series and is readily interpreted within the framework of the covarion model of molecular evolution.

Background
With the rapid growth of the collection of sequenced
genomes from diverse taxa, reconstruction of the evolutionary history of organisms on the basis of full-scale
comparison of their genomes becomes feasible and often
seems to be the strategy of choice for phylogenetic analysis [1,2]. Rare genomic changes (RGCs) that are unique to
specific clades are often viewed as particularly promising
phylogenetic markers [3-6]. The RGCs are shared derived
characters (synapomorphies or 'Hennigian' markers that
form the basis of classical cladistics [3,6,7]) manifest at
the genomic level. By definition, RGCs are chosen such
that there is a reasonable degree of confidence that each of
them is caused by a single (or a few) rare mutational
event. Some of the most prominently used RGCs include
retroposon integrations, insertions and deletions (indels)
of introns and large protein segments, evolutionary conserved motifs in proteins, protein domain fusions,
changes in gene order, and genetic code variants [3,4,8,9].
In many recent studies, RGCs have been employed to infer
phylogenetic trees, typically, by using maximum parsimony [3,4,6,10]. The emerging consensus seems to be
that RGCs often are phylogenetically informative. In cases
where sequence data generate conflicting or equivocal
results, RGCs offer an independent way of evaluating
alternative phylogenies. As a case in point, RGC analysis
has recently suggested substantial revisions of the deep
branching of evolutionary trees for eukaryotes [11,12]
and prokaryotes [13]. However, systematic identification
of genomic changes that qualify as RGCs but are sufficiently numerous to be employed for reliable phylogenetic analysis remains a major challenge [3].
Recently, we proposed a new class of RGCs designated
RGC_CAMs (after Conserved Amino acids-Multiple substitutions), which are inferred using a genome-scale analysis of protein and underlying nucleotide sequence
alignments [14]. The RGC_CAM approach involves analysis of amino acid residues that are conserved in the major
lineages within an analyzed taxonomic division (e.g.,
eukaryotes), with the exception of a few species that possess a different residue which could be a shared derived
character of the corresponding clade. The RGC_CAM analysis has been combined with several statistical tests of
competing phylogenetic hypotheses and has been shown
to be robust to branch length differences and taxon sampling within a broad range of variation [14].
The RGC_CAM analysis was performed under the
assumption that any character shared by the included
major eukaryotic lineages (plants, animals, fungi, and
Apicomplexa) is the ancestral state whereas the deviating
species possess a derived state. The principal obstacle to
any RGC methods is homoplasy, i.e., the same amino acid
replacements that occur in different lineages independ-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/7

ently and thus do not reflect common ancestry but rather
represent parallel, reverse, or convergent changes [15].
The RGC_CAMs were specifically designed to mimimize
the level of homoplasy by analyzing only those amino
acid replacements that require two or three nucleotide
substitutions. Multiple substitutions are rare, so the
chance to encounter homoplasy is expected to be much
lower compared to amino acid changes that require single
nucleotide substitutions [16,17], making these replacements plausible RGCs.
The RGC_CAM method is not homoplasy-free [14]. Here
we present a scheme to directly estimate the numbers of
events leading to homoplasy, namely, parallel changes
and reversals. We show that taking homoplasy into
account only reinforced the phylogenetic conclusions of
the RGC_CAM analysis. In addition, it is demonstrated
that parallel changes are significantly more common in
internal branches of different subtrees that are separated
from the common ancestor by relatively short times than
in terminal branches separated by longer time intervals.
This finding seems to provide the molecular-evolutionary
underpinning of Vavilov's law of homologous series and
is readily explained within the framework of the covarion
model of molecular evolution.

Results
Animal phylogeny under the RGC_CAM approach
The animal phylogeny adopted in this study is shown in
Figure 1. The branch lengths were estimated in RGC_CAM
units. In agreement with previous findings [18], it was
found that the three available nematode gene sets comprise a fast-evolving lineage (Figure 1) which would often
lead to errors when conventional phylogenetic methods
are applied [5,19,20]. Mammals represent the most
slowly evolving clade but the deuterostome clade shows
high variability of evolutionary rates owing to the fast
evolving sea urchin and Ciona lineages (Figure 1). Insects
have slower evolutionary rates compared to nematodes,
and the insect and nematode clades show relatively little
variation of evolutionary rates (Figure 1).

As shown previously, the RGC_CAM approach supported
the coelomate clade that unites deuterostomes with
arthropods as opposed to the ecdysozoan (molting animals) clade that encompasses arthropods and nematodes
[14,21]. This conclusion is compatible with the results of
some of the previous genome-wide phylogenetic analyses
[22-26] whereas other such analyses claim support for
ecdysozoa [27-29]. Moreover, the ecdysozoan topology is
currently favored in the evo-devo community, on the
basis of the apparently all-important shared feature,
namely, molting [30,31]. Interestingly, a subsequent reanalysis of RGC_CAMs, with the sequences from the sea

We further explored the support for different topologies
from RGC_CAM analysis by performing taxon sampling
on the outgroup species set. All combinations of 12 to 19
species, i.e., including from one to 8 outgroup species
(255 samples altogether), were analyzed (see Additional
File 1). For 85 combinations of species, the raw number
of RGC_CAMs compatible with the coelomate topology
was greater than the number of RGC_CAMs compatible
with the ecdysozoa topology, whereas the reverse was true
of 88 combinations, with the remaining 82 combinations
showing the same number of RGC_CAMs for both topologies (Additional file 1). The number of RGC_CAMs in
favor of the "bizarre" topology (grouping of mammals
with nematodes to the exclusion of insects) was markedly

smaller (Figure 2 and Additional file 1). Thus, when raw
numbers are considered, the levels of support for the coelomate topology and the ecdysozoan topology are nearly
the same. However, as shown previously, when the
branch lengths are taken into account, the support for the
coelomate clade becomes substantially greater than that
for ecdysozoa [21].
Nevertheless, the two conflicting signals remain. The simplest explanation for this conflict is homoplasy, and
indeed, it has been shown that, although the RGC_CAM
approach is designed to minimize this effect, it is not
homoplasy-free [14,21]. In the following two sections, we
directly assess the level of homoplasy among RGC_CAMs.
Homoplasy: parallel changes
There are two types of evolutionary events that would lead
to homoplasy in the RGC_CAM analysis, namely, parallel
changes and reversals (Figure 1) [14,21,32]. The
RGC_CAM approach provides for the possibility to estimate the level of homoplasy directly. To obtain an estimate of the number of parallel changes, we employed the
scheme shown in Figure 3. We required that the same
amino acid is shared by two or three pairs of closely
related species (e.g. two mosquitoes and two Caenorhabditis species) (Figure 3) under the condition that the pair (or
triple) of species must have a closely related outgroup
which contains the ancestral amino acid. In this case, two
parallel changes is the most parsimonious explanation for
the observed pattern because all other scenarios require at

least three events (Figure 3). All combinations of 12 to 19
species, i.e., including from one to 8 outgroup species
(255 samples altogether), were analyzed (Additional File
1). For both insects and deuterostomes, we analyzed two
internal branches, one of which was closer to the root
("old") and the other one was closer to the leaves ("new")
(Figure 1). Parallel changes in these branches were identified by performing taxon sampling of the outgroup species (Additional File 1). Taxon sampling was necessary
because both the number of RGC_CAMs supporting a
given topology and the number of observed parallel
changes critically depend on the composition of the outgroup. When all 8 or any combination of 7 outgroup species are included, there are no RGC_CAMs in the
deuterostome branch, the insect branch becomes very
short as well, and only one or two parallel changes are
seen (Additional File 1). In contrast, for many combinations of smaller numbers of outgroup species, several parallel changes between nematodes (N) and insects,
particularly, in the "old" internal branches (Io) were
detected (Figure 4 and Additional File 1). The insect "old"
branch Io is only slightly longer than the "new" branch In
(8 RGC_CAMs and 6 RGC_CAMs, respectively; Figure 1),
so the substantial excess of parallel changes in the "old"
branch was unexpected. The same pattern was seen
between the "old" and "new" insect branches and the
"new" deuterostome branch, with a much greater number

of parallel changes occurring in the "old" insect branch
(Figure 5 and Additional File 1). Thus, the rate of parallel
changes is not uniform, with deeper, more ancient
branches being more prone to parallel changes.
We further employed a relaxed scheme for parallel change
detection where these changes were detected between terminal branches (species) rather than between internal
branches as in the analyses described above. Specifically,
the branches leading to the two Caenorhabditis species
and those leading to the two mosquito species were compared. The Caenorhabditis terminal branches are approximately three times shorter than the internal nematode
branch, whereas the terminal mosquito branches are
approximately twice as long as the "new" internal insect
branch (Figure 1). Accordingly, one would expect to
observe a number of parallel changes close to that in the
N_In comparison (Figure 4). However, we detected no
parallel changes in any of the 4 comparisons. This result is
unlikely to be due to short branch lengths because parallel
changes were readily detected for much shorter "old"
internal branches, e.g., in the Io_Do comparison (Figure
5). The absence of parallel changes in the terminal
branches is consistent with the excess of parallel changes
in deep branches of phylogenetic trees described above.
To determine the statistical significance of this trend, we
used the following simplified scheme. The number of
unique parallel changes in selected branch pairs was tallied from the 255 sampling experiments (all repeated parallel changes were removed from this analysis, thus the

resulting number was the union of parallel changes
detected in individual experiments). Specifically, the
N_Io, N_In, N_Ag, and N_Aa comparisons were analyzed.
For N_Io, 6 unique parallel changes were detected,
whereas the other three comparisons taken together
yielded 3 unique parallel changes (Table 1). The internal
nematode branch N is the same for all comparisons, thus
the frequency of parallel changes depends on the length of
the insect branches only. The ratio of the length of the Io
branch to the total length of all involved branches is ~0.2
(Table 1). The probability to observe 6 of the total of 9
detected parallel changes in this relatively short branch is
0.003 under the binomial test.
Although the observed excess of parallel changes in internal branches gained unequivocal statistical support, the
raw numbers of parallel changes were small. To increase
the resolution of the analysis of parallel changes, we
relaxed the definition of RGC by allowing all possible
amino acid replacements (as opposed to only those that
require two or three nucleotide substations in
RGC_CAMs). We denote these characters RGC_CAs. Such
relaxation of the original RGC definition is expected to
result in a dramatic increase of homoplasy. Thus, much
larger raw numbers could be obtained for the analysis of
parallel changes although alternative explanations involving combinations of more than two parallel changes and/
or reversals simultaneously become more likely. Although
numerically the excess of parallel changes in deep
branches was less dramatic than in the RGC_CAM comparison, the statistical support for this trend was even
stronger (P < 10-7) owing to the large number of observa-

tions (Table 1). The same trend was found for the other,
shorter internal branches, such as Do and Dn when parallel
changes were measured in RGC_CAs (in this case, the
lengths of the branches differed greatly, so the effect was
not obvious from the comparison of the raw numbers but
became apparent after normalization over branch length;
Table 1).
The estimates of the parallel changes presented here could
not be directly factored into the RGC_CAM analysis of the
Coelomate-Ecdysozoan problem because the informative
RGC_CAMs for addressing this problem and the events
leading to homoplasy were located on different branches
of the phylogenetic tree (Figures 1, 3, and 6). Extrapolation of the estimated parallel changes for the branches
leading to the analyzed trifurcation is complicated by the
observed increase in the number of parallel changes from
the leaves of the tree toward the analyzed trifurcation.
Nevertheless, we attempted a crude estimation using the
simplest, linear model of the increase in parallel changes
depending on the depth of the tree. Specifically, the
number of parallel changes between the branches leading
from the trifurcation to insects and nematodes was estimated as:
Pe = PN_Io(Nt/N) (It/Io)C2
where Pe is the estimated number of parallel changes,
PN_Io is the observed number of parallel changes between
the insect "old" branch and the internal nematode
branch, (Nt/N) is the ratio of the lengths of nematodes-totrifurcation branch and the internal nematode branch, (It/
Io) is the analogous ratio for insects, and C is the coefficient of linear increase in the number of parallel changes
from the leaves of the tree toward the analyzed trifurcation and calculated as the ratio of the numbers of parallel
changes between the internal nematode branch and the
"old" and "new" insect branches, i.e., C = PN_Io/PN_In. In
order to obtain more reliable estimates, the N_Io vs. N_In
were taken from the RGC_CA data (Table 1): C = 45/22~2.
The Pe values were obtained for each of the 255 sampling
experiments (Additional file 1) and were compared to the
number of characters supporting Ecdysozoa (Figure 2).
The two series of values have close mean values (2.96 for
Pe and 3.46 for the number of RGC_CAMs supporting
ecdysozoa) although the difference is statistically significant (P = 0.02) by Student's t-test). Although these estimates are based on simplistic assumptions and should be
interpreted with extreme caution, they suggest that the
non-negligible support of the Ecdysozoa clade could be,
largely, explained by parallel changes, owing, primarily,
to the long nematode branch. Analogous estimates for the
insect-deuterostome comparison yielded extremely small
numbers (0 in most of the sampling experiments) owing
to the short deuterostome branch (data not shown) com-

pared to the number of RGC_CAMs supporting the coelomate clade (Figure 2). Thus, parallel changes hardly can
explain a substantial fraction of the RGC_CAMs supporting the coelomate clade.
Homoplasy: reversals
Reversals comprise the second potential source of homoplasy (Figure 1). To obtain an estimate of the number of
reversals, we employed the scheme shown in Figure 6. We
required the same amino acid to be shared by a pair of
closely related species (e.g. human-mouse) and the out-

group species (fungi, plant, protist, Nematostella vectensis,
and Trichoplax adhaerens) but not the rest of the animals
(Figure 6). In this case, a reversal in an internal branch is
the most parsimonious scenario, assuming that the tree
topology in the node leading to vertebrates, insects and
nematodes is a true trifurcation. If this is not the case, two
parallel changes also might explain the observed pattern
for the "old" branches, one in the internal branch leading
to the Coelomata (or Ecdysozoa) clade and the other in a
terminal branch on the other side of the tree. Thus, the
obtained estimates comprise the upper bound of the

cies, i.e., including from one to eight outgroup species
(255 samples altogether), were analyzed (Additional file

A substantial number of reversals were detected in the
internal nematode branch (Figure 7) although the
number of reversals was significantly (Student's t-test, P <
10-6) smaller than the number of RGC_CAMs supporting
the coelomate clade (Additional File 1). Reversals have
been invoked by Irimia et al. [32] to explain (away) the
observed RGC_CAM support for the coelomate clade.
However, the results presented here along with those in a
previous study that was performed on a different set of
species [21] show that the number of reversals is insufficient to account for this support.

branches (including the nematode internal branch). For a
"new" internal branch, a reversal is the unequivocal most
parsimonious scenario. All combinations of 12 to 19 spe-

Analysis of reversals in insects and deuterostomes
revealed a pattern similar to that observed for parallel
changes, i.e., the total number of reversals in the "old"
internal branch was greater than the number of reversals
in the "new" branch (Figures 1, 8 and 9). However, the
difference was small and, in the case of insects, potentially
could be attributed to the length difference between the
"old" and "new" branches (Figure 1). To test the hypothesis that reversals are more prevalent in deep branches, we
employed a scheme where only one Caenorhabditis species
or one mosquito species shared an RGC_CAM with the
outgroup species and other animals. This resulted in a
smaller number of probable reversals compared to the
internal branches (results not shown), however the pattern was not as obvious as that with parallel changes
where none were seen in the terminal branches (see
above).

To determine the statistical significance of the apparent
excess of reversal in deep branches, we used the same
approach as described above for parallel changes. The
number of unique reversals in selected branches was calculated from the 255 sampling experiments (all repeated
reversals were removed from this analysis, thus the resulting number was the union of the reversals detected in
individual experiments) (Table 2). For this test, we chose
the insect clade because the bizarre hypothesis never
gained any substantial support in any experimental settings (Figure 2 and [22-29]) and is generally not considered a plausible evolutionary scenario [30,31]. Thus two
parallel changes as an alternative to a reversal can be effectively ruled out. Substantial numbers of reversals were
detected in all analyzed insect branches (Table 2). The differences between branches were not significant (results
not shown). However, the raw numbers were small (Table
2) which could hamper the statistical analysis. In order to
increase the resolution, we again turned to RGC_CAs (see
above) which yielded greater raw numbers of reversals
(Table 2). In this RGC_CA analysis, a relatively small but
statistically significant (P < 10-9) excess of reversals in the
"old" branch was observed (Table 2). Thus, reversals seem
to show the same, albeit much weaker, evolutionary trend
as parallel changes (compare the results in Table 1 and 2).
For RGC_CAMs, we assumed that the conserved amino
acid in the outgroup species represents the ancestral state.
However, two parallel changes (Y->X in the branch leading to the outgroup species and in the analyzed internal
branch) also could explain the pattern in Figure 6, and
this effect might be especially important when the
number of outgroup species is small. To assess the effect
of such parallel changes, we required that the outgroup set

Io is the "old" internal insect branch, In is the "new" internal insect
branch, Ag indicates the terminal branch leading to Anopheles gambiae,
Aa indicates the terminal branch leading to Aedes aegypti. The relative
branch length was calculated as the ratio of the length of the analyzed
branch to the total length of all involved branches averaged over 255
sampling experiments (complete sampling) or from restricted
sampling with at least 2 or 3 outgroup species. Normalized number of
reversals is the number of reversals divided by the branch length.

included, at least, 2 or 3 species. The results were not significantly different from those obtained with the unrestricted taxon sampling (Table 2), suggesting that the
absence of dramatic differences between the "old" and
"new" branches is a reliable result that does not depend
on the number of outgroup species.
As discussed above, a substantial number of reversals were
detected in the internal nematode branch (Figure 7); in
principle, these reversals might explain (part of) the
observed RGC_CAM support for the coelomate clade. We
applied the adjustment procedure described in the preceding section to the reversals in the nematode branch. As

expected, the estimated number of reversals on the trifurcation-nematode branch was greater than the observed
number of reversals on the internal nematode branch
(Figure 7). However, the difference, in this case, was relatively minor (a ~1.3-fold increase, on average), and estimated number of reversals was still significantly smaller
than the number of RGC_CAMs supporting the coelomate clade (the mean number of reversals was 2.07, and
the mean number of supporting RGC_CAMs was 5.54, P
< 10-6 by Student's t-test).

Discussion
Homoplasy, arguably, is the principal impediment for all
(broadly defined) cladistic approaches in phylogenetics.
Here, we present direct estimates of two types of events,
namely, parallel changes and reversal, that lead to homoplasy. With regard to the potential effects of homoplasy
on the resolution of the Coelomata-Ecdysozoa problem,
the present estimates should be interpreted with caution
because the informative RGC_CAMs relevant for this
problem and the events conducive to the direct estimation
of homoplasy were located on different branches of the
phylogenetic tree (Figures 1, 3, and 6). Nevertheless, with
this caveat, the present provide further support to the Coelomate clade that has been observed in our previous analyses using the RGC_CAM approach [14,21]. The rate of
reversals was nearly uniform across the tree, and the
number of reversals in the nematode branch was significantly smaller than the number of RGC_CAMs supporting
the coelomate clade. An analogous estimate for parallel
changes was complicated by the observed substantial
increase in the number of parallel changes from the leaves
of the tree toward the analyzed trifurcation. Nevertheless,
a conservative estimate that was obtained using the simplest, linear model of the increase in parallel changes
depending on the depth of the tree showed that parallel
changes made negligible contribution to the support of
the Coelomate clade, given the very short internal branch
leading to Deuterostomes. In contrast, the non-negligible
support of the Ecdysozoa clade was, largely, explained by
parallel changes, owing to the long nematode branch. Of
course, interpretation of these results requires caution as
with any result obtained with the parsimony principle.
We inferred parallel changes and/or reversals under evolutionary scenarios that, according to maximum parsimony,
required two substitutions (Figures 3 and 6). We cannot
rule out that non-parsimonious scenarios that involve
more than two parallel changes and/or reversals might
have some impact on the RGC_CAs and RGC_CAMs analyses. However, it is expected that RGC_CAMs (and, to a
lesser extent, RGC_CAs) are, largely, refractory to this
problem because the probability of three independent
rare events is much smaller than two independent rare
events.

Homoplasy is a major problem for phylogenetic methods
but it is also an aspect of sequence evolution that deserves
analysis in its own right. In particular, the intriguing finding of a dramatic excess of parallel changes in internal
branches of a phylogenetic tree compared to terminal
branches (leaves) begs an explanation. We believe that
such an explanation can be readily found within the
framework of the covarion concept of molecular evolution [33-36]. According to the covarion concept, at any
given moment in evolution, only a (relatively) small subset of amino acid sites (termed covarions, after concomitantly variable codons) in a protein can accommodate
replacements whereas the replacements in the remaining
sites are deleterious due to functional constraints. Each
fixed replacement changes the set of covarions, rendering
replacements in some of the previous covarions inadmissible but simultaneously yielding new covarions. It has
been reported that covarion models fit protein sequence
comparison data better than simpler models of rate variation in which site constraints remain unchanged throughout time [37,38]. In current mathematical models [37,3941] that embody the covarion hypothesis, codon sites
oscillate between "variable" and "invariable" states independently of each other. Over long evolutionary intervals,
the resulting "wave" of covarions encompasses all or most
of the protein sequence. Under this model of evolution,
two diverging lineages have the same set of covarions
immediately after divergence but, with time passing, the
overlap between the sets of covarions progressively
decreases (Figure 10). This being the case, it becomes
obvious that the likelihood of parallel changes drops concomitantly with the decrease of the overlap between the
covarion sets of diverging lineages. The possibility of parallel changes is not eliminated altogether because, in the
course, of evolution, the same sites can be independently
recruited into evolving covarion sets of different lineages.

In a broader evolutionary context, the observed excess of
parallel changes seems to provide the molecular-evolutionary underpinning for the "law of homologous series
in variation". The law of homologous series was propounded by the famous Russian geneticist, botanist, and
plant geographer Nikolai I. Vavilov as a generalization of
his extensive observations on the variability of traits in
cultured and wild plants [42-46]. In Vavilov's words,
"Species and genera that are genetically closely related are
characterized by similar series of heritable variations with
such regularity that knowing the series of form within the
limits of one species, we can predict the occurrence of parallel forms in other species and genera. The more closely
related the species...in the general system, the more resemblance will there be in the series of variations." [42].
Owing to its predictive power, the law of homologous
series has been touted as the "Mendeleev table of biology"
by Vavilov and his disciples [47] but has received relatively little attention in modern research [43]. One obvious reason for this relative neglect would be that the
molecular underpinning of Vavilov's law so far has not
been elucidated [43]. The excess of parallel changes in
deep branches of phylogenetic trees reported here precisely mimics the law of homologous series at the molecular level in that more closely related sequences are more
prone to parallel mutations, presumably, because they
have substantially overlapping sets of covarions, unlike
sequences that have diverged farther (Figure 10). The
excess of parallel changes for distantly related species
observed in this paper reverberates with the recent finding
of a high frequency of parallel changes in evolving protein
sequences from mammalian, fruit fly and yeast species
[48].
Remarkable as a biological phenomenon, the non-uniform distribution of parallel changes across the tree
branches creates a major problem for the RGC_CAM
approach as well as for conventional phylogenetic methods because the rate of parallel changes on the informative branches emitting from the analyzed trifurcation is
hard to extrapolate. However, as a first approximation,
using a simple, linear extrapolation, we showed that, in
the specific case of the Coelomata-Ecdysozoa dilemma,
taking into account parallel changes does not affect the
support for Coelomata but eliminates much of the support for Ecdysozoa.
In contrast, the analysis of reversals under the RGC_CAM
approach did not reveal any excess in internal branches
compared to terminal branches. When we used a less
restrictive approach to character definition in which the
requirement of multiple mutations was lifted (RGC_CAs),
a weak, although statistically significant trend of the same
direction was detected. As with parallel changes, this does
not seem surprising under the covarion model because,

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/7

considering reversals to a particular ancestral state, any
site is progressively less likely to remain within the covarion set with increasing time since divergence and therefore the number of reversals (and any other multiple
substitutions) could be expected to drop. In practice, however, the estimates of reversals on terminal branches can
be used for extrapolation of reversals on the branches
emitting from the analyzed trifurcation. Such estimates
have shown that the number of reversals is relatively small
compared to the number of informative RGC_CAMs.

Conclusion
Homoplasy is usually considered as a complication in
phylogenetics including various flavors of cladistic analysis. The incentive for this study was no exception as we
sought to directly estimate the rates of two types of events
leading to homoplasy, parallel changes and reversals, in
order to assess the effect of homoplasy on the results of
the RGC_CAM analysis.
We found that, although a considerable number of parallel changes and reversals were detected, the results of the
previous analyses, in particular, the support for the Coelomata clade, as opposed to the Ecdysozoa clade, were not
changed by homoplasy. Moreover, parallel changes did
not affect the support for Coelomata but accounted for
most of the support for Ecdysozoa. In the process of this
analysis, we discovered a non-uniform distribution of parallel changes across the branches of phylogenetic trees,
with an excess in internal branches as compared to leaves.
This non-uniformity creates a potentially serious problem
for RGC_CAM and similar analyses because it complicates
extrapolation of the number of parallel changes to internal branches. Specifically, however, the support for the
Coelomata clade was not compromised. By contrast, most
of the observed support for the Ecdysozoa clade could be
explained by parallel changes. The excess of parallel
changes in deep branches of phylogenetic trees is a notable evolutionary phenomenon in itself. It seems to be
readily interpretable in terms of the covarion model of
molecular evolution, and provides the molecular-evolutionary underpinning of Vavilov's law of homologous
series.

Materials and methods
Orthologous protein sets and alignments
Each of the 462 protein alignments analyzed here was
constructed from selected euKaryotic Orthologous
Groups (KOGs [49]) and included orthologous genes
from 10 eukaryotic species with completely sequenced
genomes: Homo sapiens (Hs), Caenorhabditis elegans (Ce),
Caenorhabditis briggsae (Cb), Drosophila melanogaster
(Dm), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc), Schizosaccharomyces
pombe (Sp), Arabidopsis thaliana (At), Anopheles gambiae
(Ag), Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), and Mus musculus (Mm)

[14]. Amino acid sequence alignments are available at the
authors' Web site [50]. To these KOGs, probable
orthologs from several other eukaryotic genomes, namely,
those of Brugia malayi (Bm), Aedes aegypti (Aa), Ciona
intestinalis (Ci), Apis mellifera (Am), Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn), Dictyostelium discoideum (Dd), Nematostella vectensis (Nv), Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (St), and Trichoplax
adhaerens (Ta) were added using the COGNITOR method
[51]. Briefly, all the protein sequences from the new
genomes are compared to the protein sequences previously included in the KOGs; a protein is assigned to a
KOG when two genome-specific best hits to members of
the given KOG are detected. To minimize misalignment
problems, only conserved, unambiguously aligned
regions of the alignments constructed using the MUSCLE
program [52] were included in the further analysis. Specifically, all positions containing a deletion or insertion in at
least one sequence were removed from the protein
sequence alignment together with 5 adjacent positions
[14,21].
Frequency of amino acid substitutions
Biases in amino acid substitutions might represent a substantial problem for phylogenetic analysis [53]. In order
to assess the potential effect of such biases on the outcome
of the RGC_CAM analysis, we analyzed frequencies of
amino acids involved in RGC_CAMs for nematodes, deuterostomes and arthropods (Additional file 2). We found
that the distributions of mutated amino acids are not significantly different between these lineages (Additional file
3), and the same result was obtained for the amino acids
that result from the RGC_CAM substitutions (Additional
files 2 and 3). In addition, we found that the distributions
were positively correlated between clades, and for some of
the pairwise comparisons, this correlation was statistically
significant (Additional files 3). Thus, biases in amino acid
substitutions do not appear to present a major problem
for the RGC_CAM approach.
Relaxed molecular clock properties of RGC_CAMs
To assess the validity of RGC_CAMs as phylogenetic characters, we assessed the variation of evolutionary rates
measured in RGC_CAM units along the analyzed clades,
i.e., the extent of clock-like behavior of RGC_CAMs. For
normalization, we turned to molecular dating; considering the controversies in this area [54-56], we employed
relatively well established, recent dates of species divergence as calibration points. The following equation was
used:

Te = Tc × [(L1 + L2 + L3)/L3]

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/7

species (calibration point), and L1, L2 and L3 are branch
lengths, with L3 representing the length of a branch emitted by the node corresponding to the given Tc (Figure 1).
This equation is based on the assumption that the rate of
RGC_CAM emergence is the same in terminal and internal branches for each clade of animals. Time estimates
allow us to test this assumption. We used the following
calibration times: 95 Mya for the human-mouse divergence [57], 80 Mya for the C. elegans – C. briggsae divergence [58], and 250 Mya for A. gambiae – A. aegypti
divergence [59].
The time estimates obtained with the RGC_CAM
approach are shown in Additional File 4. There is a substantial variance of the Te estimates (348 – 902 Mya)
because of the major branch length differences and the
small number of RGC_CAMs on some branches (e.g., 3
RGC_CAMs on the mouse branch compared to 1
RGC_CAM on the human branch) which leads to overdispersion. These time estimates (Additional File 4) are
lower than the previously reported early divergence dates
for animal phyla, i.e., 970–1040 Mya [57,60]. The mean
estimate for the nematodes-insects-vertebrates divergence
is 646 Mya. With two branches, A. gambiae and A. aegypti,
lower Te values were obtained (Additional File 4); these
values are better compatible with more recent divergence
dates which, in turn, are consistent with the Cambrian
explosion [61,62]. The reasonable consistency of the
obtained time estimates (with the exception of two outlier
values given by mouse and C. briggsae; see additional File
4) suggests that RGC_CAMs behave as a relaxed molecular
clock [63], i.e., the rates of RGC_CAMs emergence are,
approximately, the same in the analyzed terminal and
internal branches of all three clades. In some cases, length
estimates of terminal branches (e.g., the long branch leading to sea urchin) might be unreliable because of population polymorphism and/or sequencing errors. Thus, in
the present analysis, whenever feasible, we used pairs or
triplets of (relatively) closely related species (e.g., mammals or nematodes) instead of a single species.

Reviewers' comments
Reviewer's report 1
Alex Kondrashov, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA

This is an interesting paper. Studying homoplasy in some
of the least homoplasy-prone traits associated with proteins is important, because only traits of proteins can be
used to infer relationships between distant forms of life.
Relating parallelism in protein evolution to Vavilov's
homologous series also makes sense, partially. And a contribution to Coelomata-Ecdysozoa debate also makes
sense – although I am not sure that this issue really wants
to be resolved (what if the two successive branching
events were separated by 10 My some 1000 Mya?).
Author response: The last point is well appreciated, the Coelomata-Ecdysozoa conundrum, like other phylogenetic problems
that date to "Big Bang" epochs, might not be particularly willing to give in. However, we view it as an interesting point in
eukaryotic evolution for better understanding the potential and
limitations of different phylogenetic methods.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/7

(in particular, see Chaisson M. J., Raphael B. J., and
Pevzner P. A. Microinversions in mammalian evolution.
PNAS 2006 103: 19824–19829), because in this case multiple origins of the same state are unlikely. Substitutions
(nucleotide or even amino acid) are not as good, because
the number of possible trait states (4 or 20) is small
enough to allow substantial homoplasy. Still, the kinds of
substitutions used by the authors (RGC-CAMs, 2- or 3nucleotide amino acid substitutions at conservative sites)
are the closest thing to RGCs among all substitutions.
Using them makes sense, due to two reasons. First,
changes associated with non-coding sequences are not
suitable for comparison of distant organisms, where such
sequences are too dissimilar. Second, indels in conservative regions of proteins are probably too rare, even at the
level of the whole proteome.
4. What about convergent evolution – because for an
RGC-CAM there are more than two possible trait states,
convergence is a possibility.
Author response

I do not have any hard criticisms – but here are some
points worth considering:
1. Rare genomic changes (RGC) definitely are the way to
go – as long as we have genome-scale data, so that we can
observe enough of them. Indeed, homoplasy is the worst
enemy of phylogenetic reconstructions, and RGCs are less
prone to it.
2. I believe that talking about cladistics, synapomorphies,
and Hennigian markers in the context of RGCs may be
misleading. Cladistics or not, homoplasy-free traits are
the best for phylogenetics (Darwin knew this) and if we
can be sure that evolution was homoplasy-free, the most
parsimonious tree is the correct one – see Felsenstein's
book. This is true even if we do not know which states of
RGCs are derived (rooting the tree is a separate problem)
– the correct unrooted tree is still the maximally parsimonious one. And, in the simplest case of binary traits, it is
very easy to see if the data are consistent with no homoplasy – this is the case as long as there are no pairwise conflicts between traits (a conflict between two traits appears
if all 4 combinations of their states are present – see Pairwise Compatibility Theorem in Felsenstein's book).

It is hard to study convergent changes for the current dataset
because the tree density (Figure 1) is insufficient. Some convergent changes might be counted as parallel changes.
5. The point about Vavilov's homologous series is welltaken. However, parallel evolution can only explain a part
of this phenomenon. Even more importantly, similar (not
necessarily homologous; see Wooding S. et al. Independent evolution of bitter-taste sensitivity in humans and
chimpanzees. Nature 440, 930 – 934, 2006) mutations
and polymorphisms cause similar ("homologous") phenotypes in closely related species (this is discussed in
Mednikov's book; Mednikov BM. The law of homologous
series. To the 60th anniversary of the discovery of the law
by N. I. Vavilov. Moscow, Znanie, 1980). This second factor is probably the key reason for homologous variation
within closely related species.

Author response: We believe that mentioning cladistics and
derived characters will not mislead the reader, and this is,
indeed, rather traditional in studies that involve RGCs. The
reader interested in further insight will appreciate this comment.

Author response: It is suggested here that the parallel phenotypic changes observed by Vavilov could be caused by different
mutations in orthologous genes. One should note, however, that
in the exciting paper of Wooding et al., the mutations involved
differentially impair the gene in question. This, indeed, could
be rather widespread and could cause parallel emergence of
some common phenotypes. However, the explanation of the
higher prevalence of parallel mutations in closely related species
steeped in the covarion model, as suggested here, applies to all
kinds of mutations not just those that impair function, and in
that regard, appears to be considerably more general.

3. The most homoplasy-free RGCs are associated with
large-scale events – deletions, insertions, and inversions

This manuscript develops on the observation that rare
genomic changes (here, amino-acid substitutions
observed only in the ingroup, not in outgroups, and
requiring two or three nucleotide changes), which were
selected for their supposed very small probability of
appearing twice independently during evolution, actually
reveal significant homoplasy, so that the branching order
between arthropods, nematodes and vertebrates is still
unresolved. Here Rogozin et al. ask what kinds of multiple
change events have affected the evolution of these characters, and in which lineages they have occurred. Having
detected more homoplasy in old than in recent branches,
the authors invoke the covarion process as the probable
reason for this unexpected pattern. I like this proposal,
which I think makes sense, and for which I wish we get
further support in the future. The authors finally argue
that, correcting for these instances of homoplasy, the Coelomata hypothesis (nematodes, (arthropodes, deuterostomes)) is best supported.
I welcome publication of this manuscript in Biology
Direct, especially since it belongs to a series of papers analysing these data – I hope that the discussion system
offered by Biology Direct will enable a grouping of the
arguments relevant to the (important) Coelomata/Ecdysozoa debate in a single editorial place, for the readers'
benefit.
Now technical comments about the paper:
1. Outgroup choice
In this study, all the possible combinations of eight outgroups are tried, and the average patterns are reported.
Combinations of outgroups are given equal a priori
weights, and unclear a posteriori weights – parallelism or
reversal events supported by several choices of outgroup
are counted once, so that combinations yielding similar
results will be underweighted, as compared to combinations supporting unique events. Yet it is clear that the various outgroups do not have the same value: some are
much closer to the ingroup than others, and therefore
more reliable. Playing with outgroups significantly modifies the picture as far as the Coelomata/Ecdysozoa controversy is concerned, as noted by Irimia & Roy. If, for
instance, one focuses on the 6th line of additional table 1,
in which only the closest two outgroups (basal metazoa
Trichoplax and Nematostella) are included, it appears that
the (roughly estimated) expected number of nematode/
insect parallel changes (5.8) is substantially less than the
number of RGC_CAMs supporting Ecdysozoa (18, vs 7 for
Coelomata), in contrast with the average (over outgroup
combinations) pattern.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/7

the numbers of shared RGC_CAMs are small and could be
severely affected by statistical errors. Thus, the reviewer's estimate of the number parallel changes should be taken with a lot
of caution. This being said, we cannot rule out the possibility
that some of the apparent phylogenetic signal in support of
Ecdysozoa is "real", i.e., due to a whole genome duplication and
subsequent gene loss (Ref. [14]). See also our response to a similar comment of reviewer #3.
2. Focusing on internal branches
Parallel changes and reversals are mostly investigated in
internal branches. Only once do the authors examine the
Caenorhabditis/Mosquito pair of terminal branches for
control. I am not sure why. Under the interesting hypothesis introduced in discussion, which states that parallel
changes are more probable in closely related lineages
thanks to a higher overlap between their sets of variable
sites (covarions), one would expect a high rate of paralellism in the Apis/Aedes and Apis/Anopheles pairs of terminal branches, for instance.

Author response: The reviewer suggests an analysis of three
patterns:
Am_In: Am = Y, Dm = X, Ag = Y, Aa = Y, all other species
= X.
Am_Ag: Am = Y, Dm = X, Ag = Y, Aa = X, all other species
= X.
Am_Aa: Am = Y, Dm = X, Ag = X, Aa = Y, all other species
= X.
It is proposed that parallel changes in the branch leading to Am
and the other insect branch could be a plausible explanation for
these patterns. We analyzed these patterns:
The numbers of RGC_CAMs are small and so hard to interpret,
however RGC_CAs, indeed, strongly supported the high rate of
parallel changes within the insect clade, just as suggested by the
reviewer. The raw number of RGC_CAs for Am_In (62) is 4fold greater than that for In_ Dn ([16], see Table 1) although
the branch lengths are almost identical (Figure 1and results
not shown). This is consistent with the prediction that parallel
changes are more likely to occur in closely related lineages.
However, there is also a potential problem with these analyses
as there are alternative scenarios that could explain the
observed patterns. For instance, the pattern Am_In can be
explained by one X->Y mutation in the branch leading from the
analyzed trifurcation to insects and another Y->X mutation in
the branch leading to Dm. We cannot estimate the impact of
such alternative scenarios at this stage.

Author response: Using only one set of outgroup species (e.g.
in the cited paper of Irimia et al.) might be misleading because

3. Using maximum parsimony (MP)
I found a bit self-contradictory to use MP to unravel the
history of these characters, when the premise of the study
is that homoplasy is substantial – i.e., MP is mislead. If
homoplasy is strong then the true scenario can be different from the MP scenario, which complicates the task of
quantifying, and locating in the tree, events of reversal or
parallelism. Specifically, I wonder whether errors of the
MP method might contribute to the amazing pattern
reported in this study – a higher amount of homoplasy in
old branches.

Let me take the example of parallel changes. Parallel
changes are invoked when (i) two distinct lineages, say A
and B, share derived state Y, while other lineages carry the
outgroup state X, and (ii) A and B are separated by at least
two internal branches in the tree. This is so because if A
and B are separated by a single internal branch (e.g. Apis
and Drosophila) then the pattern can as well be explained
by a reversal in the lineage branching in between (mosquitos). This is strict MP rationale. Now assume that evolution is not strictly parsimonious, and give a non-zero
probability to suboptimal scenarios. If A and B are separated by exactly two internal branches, then a scenario
with two reversals (in the two lineages branching between
A and B) requires just one more step than the MP scenario.
So you expect that a certain fraction of such characters will
be falsely interpreted as old parallelisms, when they actually correspond to young reversals. The probability that
multiple reversals induce a parallelism-like pattern
decreases as the topological distance between A and B
increases (since the number of required reversals
increases), mimicking the covarion effect.
Here is how this could translate as far as the metazoa data
set is concerned. Assume for a moment that (deuterostome, (nematode, insect)) is the true tree (Ecdysozoa
hypothesis). Patterns supporting a N-Io parallel change
could be explained by one X->Y change in the Ecdysozoa
ancestor, and two Y->X reversals: one in Apis, one in Brugia. Patterns supporting a N-In parallel change would
require three reversals (in Apis, Drosophila, and Brugia).

This might partly explain why the latter are less frequently
observed than the former.
MP can be mislead in many ways, and I do not mean to
argue that non-parsimonious evolution will always result
in older reconstructed than real changes – sometimes you
can miss old changes as well. I suggest, however, that
some caution is needed when interpreting these numbers
– they should not be taken as errorless observations, and
a careful study of the potential biases would be welcome.
I note that these potential biases might propagate to further steps of the analysis, when MP-estimated branch
lengths are used to roughly quantify the expected patterns
in nematode, insect and deuterostome stem branches.
Author response: Any phylogenetic method can mislead. We
do not think that RGC_CAMs are different in this respect from
other methods. However, taking into account that RGC_CAMs
are rare events, we do not expect that non-parsimonious evolution will be as frequent as for all possible amino acid substitutions (see also the new Ref. [43]). We agree that interpretation
of RGC_CAMs requires some caution in view of the use of parsimony and added the following to the text:
"Of course, interpretation of these results requires caution as
with any result obtained with the parsimony principle. We
inferred parallel changes and/or reversals under evolutionary
scenarios that, according to maximum parsimony, required two
substitutions (Figures 3 and 6). We cannot rule out that nonparsimonious scenarios that involve more than two parallel
changes and/or reversals might have some impact on the
RGC_CAs and RGC_CAMs analyses. However, it is expected
that RGC_CAMs (and, to a lesser extent, RGC_CAs) are,
largely, refractory to this problem because the probability of
three independent rare events is much smaller than two independent rare events."
4. Taxon sampling
Generally, I have the feeling that taxon sampling is limiting in current study of rare genomic changes in metazoa.
Our collective experience in other groups/time scales is
that methodological debates lasted until a data set of rea-

Page 14 of 18
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2008, 3:7

sonable size (taxonomy-wise) was available, after which a
consensus arose. This was the case for mammals, for
instance. I would bet that the addition of another ten
genomes to this data set will resolve the main issues, both
topological (Ecdysozoa or Coelomata?) and mechanistic
(covarion-dependent homoplasy?).
Author response: In our opinion, the decisive argument
strongly supporting the rodent-primate clade was produced by
Thomas et al. (Thomas JW, Touchman JW, Blakesley RW, et
al. (71 co-authors). 2003. Comparative analyses of multi-species sequences from targeted genomic regions. Nature. 424:
788–793) using truly irreversible RGCs (insertions of mobile
elements) for a relatively small number of species. In general,
the number of species is not important for truly irreversible
RGCs. Unfortunately, such RGCs are not available for distantly
related species. Thus, unless the newly sequenced genomes help
to resolve the issue of dramatic differences in evolutionary rates
between nematodes, insects and mammals (Figure 1), we do
not expect that adding a few more genomes will really help to
resolve the issue.
Reviewer's report 3
Robert Lanfear and Maximilian J. Telford, University College
London, London, UK (nominated by Laurence Hurst)

This is a very interesting and provocative paper. It has two
main messages:
First, that careful consideration of their RGC-CAM database seems to support the Coelomata hypothesis ((arthropods, vertebrates) nematodes) over the broadly accepted
Ecdysozoa hypothesis ((arthropods, nematodes) vertebrates).
Second, that the numbers of parallel changes in sister taxa
are much more frequent close to their divergence point
than later on, long after their divergence. This is proposed
to be due to the effects of a covarion model which suggests
similar genes (in similar genetic backgrounds?) will be
constrained to undergo similar substitutions and this will
be less true for more dissimilar genes.
We have a number of points that we feel need addressing.
As prompted by the Irimia analysis, the authors have gone
to some pains to include a diversity of outgroups. They
analyse the effects of all possible combinations of these
outgroups and tally the number of times their RGC-CAMs
support Coelomata and Ecdysozoa. Their conclusion is
that there is very little difference in the support for Ceolomata and for Ecdysozoa.
However, we know that some outgroups (close ones) are
expected a priori to be superior to more distant ones. From

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/7

their additional file 1, we have extracted the experiments
which contain 1 or both close outgroups (i.e. the metazoans Trichoplax and Nematostella) and compared these to
those experiments with no metazoan outgroups. In the
optimal cases (both metazoan outgroups included) 34 of
64 experiments support Ecdysozoa and 0 support Coelomata. Overall, including at least one metaozoan outgroup
88 analyses (out of 192) support Ecdysozoa and 22 support Coelomata. Support for Ecdysozoa is lower for Trichoplax only cases and higher for Nematostella only cases.
In the worst cases (neither metazoan present in the analysis) ALL analyses support Coelomata. To us this suggests,
that, at least in the absence of any corrections for branch
lengths, their dataset supports Ecdysozoa.
Author response
1) Correcting for branch lengths is absolutely crucial. This is
addressed in some detail in Ref. [21].
2) The reviewers believe that Nematostella a priori is a superior
outgroup. However, the internal branch between Nematostella
and the analyzed trifurcation is extremely short (0
RGC_CAMs, Figure 1), so Nematostella is too close to the trifurcation to be a reliable outgroup. For instance, if there was a
whole genome duplication and differential gene losses, Nematostella becomes an inappropriate outgroup that does not allow
correct polarization RGC_CAMs.
The results supporting the covarion model are fascinating
and very exciting. We feel that this idea might be better
tested in a dataset that has a less controversial phylogeny
and with good constraints on branch lengths/divergence
times. In particular, it seems likely that the often very
small branch lengths estimated using the RGC_CAM
approach could be particularly prone to error. Perhaps
what we really mean is that the evidence from the current
analysis needs further testing with a data set with fewer
free parameters.
Author response: We certainly appreciate this point and very
well may return to the issue with other data sets. In the meantime, we added more analysis of parallel changes within the
insect clade in our response to reviewer #2; the conclusions are
strongly reinforced.
Previously, the authors have used statistical tests to compare support for the Coelomata and Ecdysozoa hypotheses. These statistical tests were based on the assumption
that "RGC_CAMs within a gene evolve independently of
each other" (Ref. [14]). We are concerned that if the current paper is correct, and the covarion model applies, then
this assumption does not hold. If this is the case, then previous tests between hypotheses might be invalid. Could
the authors include some discussion of this point?

Page 15 of 18
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2008, 3:7

Author response: First, it seems that, should the existence of
covarions violate the independence assumption, this will affect
any statistical models and tests used in phylogenetic analysis not
only those employed in our previous RGC_CAM studies. Second, it is far from being obvious that, if the covarion model
applies, the site independence assumption does not. There is no
reason to believe that replacements within a covarion set existing at given time are not independent (although no replacements are allowed outside the covarion set), and since the
covarion set changes fast during evolution, running through the
protein sequence, the overall site independence seems a reasonable assumption. Of course, rigorous test of the covarion model
and its effects on site independence are desirable, and it is our
hope that this paper might attract some additional attention to
the study of covarions that is currently not as popular as the subject, perhaps, deserves.
"The RGC_CAM analysis has been combined with several
statistical tests of competing phylogenetic hypotheses and
has been shown to be robust to branch length differences
and taxon sampling within a broad range of variation
[14]"
We would argue that recent studies show that the
RGC_CAM approach is actually very sensitive to taxon
sampling – in both a recent critique of the approach and
the current authors response to that critique, taxon sampling was shown to be a fundamental problem, with different taxon sets giving significantly different answers to
the Coelomata/Ecdysozoa debate. Our re-analysis of the
current dataset also supports the view that taxon sampling
is of fundamental importance to the conclusions reached
using this approach.
Author response: We quite agree with the reviewers regarding the importance of taxon sampling. Therefore, here and in
Ref. [21], we used all combinations from a large set of outgroup
species. We believe this helps obtaining reliable results.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/7

Page 7:
"However, as shown previously, when the branch lengths
are taken into account, the support for the coelomate
clade becomes substantially greater than that for Ecdysozoa [21]."
Can this be clarified please. It is not clear whether the
authors corrected for branch lengths in the present analysis, or whether they are merely referring to their previous
analysis in which they did correct for branch lengths (but
used a rather more limited dataset).
Author response: We referred to our previous results (Ref.
[21]).
If the authors haven't corrected for branch length in the
current analysis, why not?
Finally, if the authors have corrected for branch length,
can the above sentence be clarified to indicate the number
of tests in which the Coelomata hypothesis receives significant support ('substantially greater' is a bit ambiguous –
does it have anything to do with significance?), and the
number in which Ecdysozoa receive significant support.
Author response: In the above sentence, we refer to the previous results where the meaning of "substantial" is explicit. The
main purpose of the present paper was not to provide additional
arguments in the Coelomata-Ecdysozoa debate but to estimate
the extent of parallel changes and reversals. Therefore, we did
not give the results of statistical test in the text. However, since
this seems to be of interest, here they are. After the essential correction for branch lengths, for 236 (93%) combinations of species, there was statistical support (Fisher's exact test) for the
coelomate clade, whereas with the rest of the combinations
(7%), none of the topologies received statistical support. This is
very similar to our previous results (Ref. [21]), and we believe
that this constitutes substantial support.

"Moreover, the ecdysozoan topology is currently favored
in the evo-devo community, on the basis of the perceived
deep commonalities in the developmental processes of
various molting animals [30,31]"
This is a misrepresentation of the evodevo community.
There is really no 'perceived deep commonality' in the
developmental basis of moulting – it is simply the case
that moulting is the only thing that appears to unite the
ecdysozoan animals, and as such it is an inferred rather
than perceived commonality.
Author response: If some of the leaders of the evo-devo community say so...corrected just as suggested.
