Abstract
Background: Duplicate genes are considered to have evolved through the partitioning of
ancestral functions among duplicates (subfunctionalization) and/or the acquisition of novel
functions from a beneficial mutation (neofunctionalization). Additionally, an increase in gene dosage
resulting from duplication may also confer an advantageous effect, as has been suggested for
histone, tRNA, and rRNA genes. Currently, there is little understanding of the effect of increased
gene dosage on subcellular networks like signal transduction pathways. Addressing this issue may
provide further insights into the evolution by gene duplication.
Results: We analyzed the evolution of multiple stickleback phosphodiesterase (PDE, EC: 3.1.4.17)
1C genes involved in the cyclic nucleotide signaling pathway. Stickleback has 8–9 copies of this gene,
whereas only one or two loci exist in other model vertebrates. Our phylogenetic and synteny
analyses suggested that the multiple PDE1C genes in stickleback were generated by repeated
duplications of >100-kbp chromosome segments. Sequence evolution analysis did not provide
strong evidence for neofunctionalization in the coding sequences of stickleback PDE1C isoforms.
On the other hand, gene expression analysis suggested that the derived isoforms acquired
expression in new organs, implying their neofunctionalization in terms of expression patterns. In
addition, at least seven isoforms of the stickleback PDE1C were co-expressed with olfactory-type
G-proteins in the nose, suggesting that PDE1C dosage is increased in the stickleback olfactory
transduction (OT) pathway. In silico simulations of OT implied that the increased PDE1C dosage
extends the longevity of the depolarization signals of the olfactory receptor neuron.
Conclusion: The predicted effect of the increase in PDE1C products on the OT pathway may play
an important role in stickleback behavior and ecology. However, this possibility should be
empirically examined. Our analyses imply that an increase in gene product sometimes has a
significant, yet unexpected, effect on the functions of subcellular networks.

Background
Duplicate genes generally persist and evolve through the
partitioning of ancestral functions among the duplicates

(subfunctionalization [1]) or the acquisition of novel
functions through the fixation of beneficial mutations
(neofunctionalization [2,3]). To date, many duplicate

genes have been shown to have evolved through sub-/
neo-functionalization in terms of the spatiotemporal pattern of their expression and/or the functional repertoire of
their coding proteins [4-7]. Additionally, duplication may
result in an increase in gene dosage that sometimes has
advantageous effects, resulting in the maintenance of the
duplicated genes [8]. For example, translational RNAs
such as tRNA and rRNA, and structural proteins such as
histones are often encoded by multiple gene copies [912]. This likely corresponds to the high demand of their
gene products needed for translational and structural
roles. Regarding subcellular networks, on the other hand,
the genes involved in transcription regulations and signal
transduction pathways were found to be over-retained in
duplicate after whole genome duplication (WGD) in
higher eukaryotes [13,14]. These data have been interpreted and discussed in the theoretical context of an
increase of gene dosage [2,15-17]. However, it remains
largely unexplored for possible effect of increased dosage
of respective genes on overall function of subcellular networks, such as signal transduction pathways. These types
of investigations may provide a more comprehensive
understanding of evolution by gene duplication.
In a previous study of vertebrate genes involved in olfactory transduction (OT), we found that the three-spined
stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus has multiple duplicates
of the phosphodiesterase (PDE, EC: 3.1.4.17) 1C gene
(Sato Y, Hashiguchi Y, Nishida M: Temporal pattern of
loss/persistence of duplicate genes involved in long-term
potentiation, taste/olfactory transduction, and tricarboxylic acid cycle after teleost-specific genome duplication,
submitted). In that study, we performed comparative
analyses among four teleost and three tetrapod genomes
to search for duplicate genes derived from the teleost-specific third-round (3R)-WGD [18,19] by focusing on several kinds of signal transduction networks. Data mining
and phylogenetic analyses showed that the PDE1C gene,
which decomposes cAMP and thus has a key role in the
negative feedback of the OT [20,21], underwent 6–7
duplications in stickleback ancestor after its split with
pufferfish. Thus, at least stickleback (and maybe also
other species related to sticklebacks) has multiple PDE1C
genes, whereas other model vertebrates including
medaka, Xenopus, and human have only one or two
PDE1C genes. However, the mechanisms for the maintenance of these PDE1C duplicates are unknown. The OT
system, in which the PDE1C is involved, is expected to
play an important role in the evolution of the stickleback,
which demonstrates interesting ecological behaviors such
as anadromous migration, territorial behavior, nest building, and parental care of eggs [22,23]. Thus, it is of interest
to understand whether the multiple PDE1Cs in stickleback have persisted through sub-/neo-functionalization

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/23

or by the effects of increased gene dosage in the OT system.
In this study, to explore the functional and evolutionary
significance of the highly duplicated PDE1C genes in the
stickleback, we carried out a comprehensive evolutionary
analysis. First, we investigated the gene phylogeny and
conserved synteny of the duplicated PDE1C genes to elucidate the chromosome/genome-level events that have
generated the multiple PDE1Cs of stickleback. Second,
based on the evolutionary framework obtained from the
above investigation, the functional diversification of
expression in organs and protein-coding sequences of the
duplicated PDE1C genes were examined by gene expression and molecular evolutionary analyses. Third, we estimated the number of PDE1C loci involved in the OT of
stickleback by analyzing co-expression between the
PDE1Cs and olfactory-type G-protein (G [olf]: the guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit alpha olfactory
type). According to the result of the co-expression analysis, finally, we attempted to address the effect of increased
PDE1C dosage on the function of the OT using in silico
pathway simulation. Our results implied that the evolutionary significance of the duplicated PDE1C genes in
stickleback is in the diversification of expression patterns
and an increase in gene dosage, rather than neofunctionalization of the coding sequences.

Results
Phylogeny and synteny among stickleback PDE1C genes
The maximum likelihood (ML)/Bayesian molecular phylogeny of chordate PDE1A and PDE1C (Figure 1) showed
that seven of the duplicated PDE1C genes in stickleback
(PDE1Cb1-b7) arose from repeated duplications that
occurred after the divergence between stickleback and
pufferfish (see Figure 1B). In addition, the teleost
(zebrafish, medaka, stickleback, and pufferfish) PDE1C
genes were grouped within two major clades, PDE1Ca
and PDE1Cb, with relatively high support values (see
black circle in Figure 1A; LR-ELW [the expected-likelihood
weights applied to local rearrangements of tree topology]
[24] edge support = 90%; Bayesian posterior probability =
95%). This branching pattern suggests that the PDE1C
gene was duplicated in a teleost ancestor after its split
from the tetrapods (see double circle in Figure 1A), possibly through the 3R-WGD [18,19]. This possibility was
examined by investigating the synteny of the surrounding
genes of the PDE1C loci in teleosts and tetrapods as
described below.

To clarify the genomic events that generated the two paralogous genes in teleosts (PDE1Ca and PDE1Cb) and
multiple PDE1Cb genes in stickleback, we investigated the
genomic regions around the PDE1C loci. We found conserved synteny between the PDE1C locus in tetrapods

medaka, stickleback, and pufferfish (described as "conserved synteny [CS]-1," Figure 2). One more homologous
region corresponding to the CS-1 was found in medaka,
pufferfish, and stickleback (described as "CS-2," Figure 2).
CS-1 and CS-2 were considered doubly conserved syntenies derived from the 3R-WGD, which corresponds to a
single tetrapod chromosome segment. However, CS-2
appeared to have lost the putative region that contains
PDE1Cb. Zebrafish PDE1Ca, pufferfish PDE1Cb, and
stickleback PDE1Cb1-b7 were found within other chromosome segments, implying secondary translocation(s)
of these PDE1C genes after the 3R-WGD. The pufferfish
PDE1Cb region partially corresponded to human chromosomes 1 (94.6–99.6 Mb) and 10 (16.6–17.3 Mb) [see
Additional file 1: Table S1]. However, we were unable to
find human chromosome regions corresponding to the
zebrafish PDE1Ca and stickleback PDE1Cb1-b7 regions.

Among the stickleback PDE1Cb1-b7 regions, the surrounding genes were very similar (see "Teleost PDE1Cb"
in Figure 2), implying that repeated segmental duplications generated the multiple PDE1Cb regions in stickleback. We found one more ninth PDE1C locus in
stickleback (provisionally named PDE1Cbx) [see Additional file 1: Table S1], whose sequence was 5'-and 3'truncated and partial (246 residues in total whereas the
others have >395 residues) probably due to incompleteness of the sequence contig where the locus was located
(scaffold_809: only 11,237 base pairs [bp] in total). We
could not conclude whether this is pseudogene or not,
and thus we did not include this locus in our analysis.
Our overall results from the phylogenetic and synteny
analyses clearly revealed the evolutionary relationships
among PDE1C genes in the bony vertebrates and the evolutionary origin of multiple PDE1C genes in stickleback.

their direction of transcription. Doubly conserved synteny, which was derived from the teleost-specific genome duplication
[18,19], is indicated by yellow shading and labeled "CS (conserved synteny)-1" and "CS-2." Orthologous/paralogous relationships among PDE1C genes are shown by solid magenta lines. The dashed lines indicate putative orthologous relationships predicted in the Ensembl genome database [40]. The solid yellow and green lines show phylogenetic relationships of neighboring
"unknown" genes around stickleback PDE1Cb loci, which are estimated in the present study [see Additional file 1, Figure S1].
The PDE1Cx (Ensembl ID: ENSGACP00000001336) [see Additional file 1, Table S1] of the stickleback is located alone in a
small contig (Scaffold 809; 12 kbp), and therefore has no synteny information.

This provided the basis for our subsequent analysis on the
molecular evolution of the multiple stickleback PDE1C
genes.
Molecular evolution of multiple PDE1C genes
The multiple PDE1C genes of stickleback were analyzed
by ML-estimation of the nonsynonymous to synonymous
substitution rates (dN/dS = ω) during evolution, which is a
possible indicator of adaptation at the protein sequence
level [25-27]. In this analysis, we tested whether some

portion of the PDE1Cb sequences shows ω >1, which is
the signature of adaptive amino acid changes, by comparing maximum-likelihood values of simple evolution
model having fewer ω parameter(s) (M0, M1, and M7 in
Table 1) with those of more complex model having more
ω parameters, some of which were allowed to be >1 (M2,
M3, and M8 in Table 1; for details, see Methods). The likelihood ratio test (LRT)-1, the comparison between M0
with M3, implied that the stickleback PDE1Cb genes
(PDE1Cb1-b7) were under positive diversifying selection

with regard to their protein sequences (ω2 = 17.83). However, the LRT-2, LRT-3, and "branch-site test", the comparison between M1 and M2, M7 and M8, and M2 and M3,
respectively, did not support this implication (ω2 = 0.15,
ω2 = 0.45, and ω2 = 0.08, respectively; see Table 1). The
LRT-1 (M3 model) detected five codon sites under positive selection, including sites 76–78, 82, and 83 (indicated by stars in Figure 3). On the other hand, the LRT-2,
LRT-3, and branch-site test (ω >1) did not identify these
individual sites as being under positive selection.
The positively selected sites inferred by the LRT-1
described above were not located on the known active
sites of the enzyme or on specific domains or motifs of the
PDE proteins (Figure 3). The active enzyme sites that are
generally conserved in PDE proteins (indicated by black
shading in Figure 3) [28] were also conserved among the
stickleback PDE1Cb genes, with exceptions at sites 238 in
PDE1Cb4, 417 in PDE1Cb4, and 443 in PDE1Cb5. Moreover, the known PDE-specific protein domains were successfully detected in all stickleback PDE1Cb genes
(indicated as solid boxes in Figure 3) via queries to protein domain databases Pfam [29] and PROSITE [30], suggesting that they conserve PDE function. On the other
hand, the sequence region containing the inferred positively-selected sites (sites 66–88; indicated as dashed
boxes in Figure 3) yielded no hits in these databases.
Those positively-selected sites were distributed on the
opposite side of a substrate-binding pocket of this enzyme
[see Additional file 1: Figure S2]. In addition, this region
did not correspond to the important variant region of the

three functional splicing variants reported in mouse
PDE1C [21].
Spatial expression of the multiple PDE1C genes
Spatial expression patterns across tissues were investigated
and compared among the multiple PDE1C and G(olf)
genes in adult stickleback (Figure 4). Reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed that
seven of the eight PDE1C genes were co-expressed with
G(olf) in the nose of stickleback. Among these seven
genes, five (PDE1Ca, PDE1Cb3, b4, b5, and b7) were
strongly expressed, and two (PDE1Cb2 and b6) were
weakly expressed in the nose. In addition, those stickleback PDE1Cs were roughly divided into two groups in
terms of their overall expression patterns. One group
included the PDE1Cs that were expressed strongly in a few
tissues ("group I"; 0–3 tissues; PDE1Ca, PDE1Cb1, b2,
b6, and b7) and the other group included the PDE1Cs
that were strongly expressed in several tissues ("group II";
4–9 tissues; PDE1Cb3, b4, and b5). Among the "group I"
genes, the expression of PDE1Ca was clearly detected in
the nose, brain, and intestine and was similar to that of
G(olf), which was strongly expressed in the nose, gill
raker, and intestine. On the other hand, PDE1Cb1, b2, b6,
and b7 seemed to have lost the strong co-expression with
G(olf) in the nose (PDE1Cb6), intestine (PDE1Cb7), or
both tissues (PDE1Cb1 and b2). Among the "group II"
genes, PDE1Cb4 was strongly expressed in the nose,
brain, skin, and skeletal muscle, and PDE1Cb3 and b5
were strongly expressed in almost all tissues.

strongly expressed, and two were weakly expressed in the
nose (see Figure 4), we set the number of PDE1C circuits
equal to six in the "multiple-PDE1Cs" model as an
approximate representation of the estimated gene dosage

Spatial expression patterns of PDE1C and G(olf) in the stickSpatial expression patterns of PDE1C and G(olf) in
the stickleback. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis was
performed to assess expression levels and patterns of G-protein subunit alpha olfactory type (G [olf]) and multiple
PDE1C genes in stickleback. Plus (+) and minus (-) signs indicate PCR assays using reverse-transcribed cDNA for each
tissue type and assays using total RNA without reverse transcription (negative controls), respectively. The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene was
amplified as a positive control. The overall expression patterns of the genes were essentially similar between the two
stickleback individuals investigated.

In silico simulations for the multiple PDE1C genes
We examined the possible effects of increased gene/product dosage from the multiple PDE1C genes in stickleback
on the output (depolarization) of the OT pathway using
in silico simulations. Figure 5 depicts a schematic diagram
of the OT simulation model constructed according to the
KEGG pathway database (panel A) [31], and a representative result of the simulation (panels B and C; the case of
"single-PDE1C [threshold = 1]" model). Figure 5B shows
that the odorant and olfactory receptor (OR) produced
OR-odorant complex (violet line) that stimulated the
G(olf) (blue line), led to depolarization occurring on the
simulation time scale of 0–10 (orange line). The depolarization is blocked by activation of the PDE1C. Figure 5C
shows that the activated G(olf) increased the concentration of Ca2+ (green line), which stimulates PDE1C (red
line) via the mediation of calmodulin (CaM; see Figure
5A). When the activity level of the PDE1C has gone over
its firing threshold (set to 1 here; see Figure 5C), the activated PDE1C decomposed cAMP (see Figure 5A), and
finally terminated the depolarization (see Figure 5C).
Although this preliminary model approach may be simple, we thought that this model would provide a basic
framework to analyze the effect of an increased dosage of
a specific element; that is, the PDE1C gene. We compared

Our OT model simulations implied that the increase in
the number of PDE1C circuits affects the longevity of the
depolarization signal (Figure 6). In the case of the singleand multiple-PDE1C models with a PDE1C threshold = 0,
the resultant depolarization signals were weak (intensity =
0.05–0.2) and short-lived (longevity = 5) when the
number of PDE1C circuits was one or six (Figure 6A and
6B). In these simulation models, PDE1C seems to work
rapidly after odorant stimulation, leading to an instant
block of depolarization by the PDE1C circuit regardless of
whether multiple PDE1Cs were involved. When the
PDE1C threshold = 1, on the other hand, the resultant
depolarization signals became more intense (intensity =
0.3–0.5; Figure 6C and 6D), and the "multiple-PDE1C
[threshold = 1]" model yielded an elongated signal of
depolarization (longevity = 17–25; Figure 6D) compared
to the "single-PDE1C [threshold = 1]" model (longevity =
8–14; Figure 6C).
We also found that the depolarization longevity of the
"multiple-PDE1C [threshold = 1]" model was further
extended by limiting the availability of Ca2+, which is an
upstream regulator of the PDE1C circuit. Ca2+ dosage limitation affected the single- and multiple-PDE1C [threshold = 1] models similarly in terms of their depolarization
intensities, which were reduced to 0.2–0.4, compared to
the model with unlimited Ca2+ (Figure 6E and 6F). In the
"multiple-PDE1C [threshold = 1] + Ca2+-limited" model,
the longevity of the depolarization signal was greatly
elongated (longevity = 25–30; Figure 6F), compared to
the "single-PDE1C [threshold = 1] + Ca2+-limited" model
(longevity = 10–15; Figure 6E).
Since the PDE1C is activated by Ca2+-activated CaM, it is
possible that the finite Ca2+ dosage invoked competition
among increased PDE1Cs, resulting in a delay in blocking
of the depolarization. This situation likely led to a positive-feedback circuit (the processes of 21–25 shown in
Figure 5A), also activated by upstream Ca2+, to be more
prevalent in the OT system. Therefore, the depolarization
longevity was extended in the "multiple-PDE1C" models
(see Figure 6D and 6F). This possibility was supported by
an in silico mutation analysis (Figure 6G and 6H), in
which we knocked out the positive feedback circuit (processes 21–25 and the related elements) in the simulation
model. In this "multiple-PDE1C [threshold = 1] + positive-feedback loop defeated" model, the resultant depo-

Schematic view of a simulation model of the olfactory transduction (OT) pathway and its simulation performance
Figure 5
Schematic view of a simulation model of the olfactory transduction (OT) pathway and its simulation performance. (A) OT simulation model constructed under the KEGG pathway database [31]. (B) Observed resultant oscillations of
the odorant, OR, OR-odorant complex, G(olf), and depolarization under the "single-PDE1C [threshold = 1]" model. The x-axis
indicates the simulation time scale, and the y-axis indicates the concentration of the odorant and/or activity intensities of
involved proteins. (C) Observed oscillations of the G(olf), depolarization, Ca2+, and PDE1C, the latter two are the key molecules of the negative feedback circuit of the OT, which finally blocks the depolarization.

larization signals were not greatly elongated (longevity =
13–17; Figure 6H), and the longevity was similar to that
of the "single-PDE1C [threshold = 1]" model (Figure 6C).

Discussion
Evolutionary origins of the multiple PDE1C genes in
stickleback
Molecular phylogenies (Figure 1) and conserved synteny
(Figure 2) analyses showed that the teleost PDE1C was
duplicated through the 3R-WGD, generating two isoforms, PDE1Ca and PDE1Cb, and that PDE1Cb was
repeatedly duplicated in the stickleback lineage 6–7 times
through chromosome segment duplications. Such multiple gene copies could be generated by fewer than six
duplications especially in tandemly located genes; however, this seems not to be the case of the stickleback
PDE1Cb genes, which are located on different scaffolds
respectively. The stickleback PDE1Cb loci and the orthologous pufferfish PDE1Cb locus appears to have translocated from CS-2, which is one of the pair of conserved

chromosome regions derived from 3R-WGD. The corresponding PDE1Cb locus in medaka and zebrafish has
been lost (Figure 2). Since no synteny was found between
stickleback PDE1Cb loci and the pufferfish PDE1Cb
locus, the translocation of the PDE1Cb gene may have
occurred independently in the two lineages. Alternatively,
the PDE1Cb translocation may have occurred once in an
earlier ancestor, and either the stickleback or pufferfish
experienced an additional PDE1Cb translocation. After
the translocation(s), the stickleback PDE1Cb gene along
with the neighboring tandemly repeated "unknown"
genes (denoted by Ensembl transcript IDs in Sca. 37, 94,
134, 154, 188, 215, and 223 in Figure 2) appeared to have
undergone lineage-specific expansion (LSE) [32] by chromosome segment duplications of >100 kbp. Such plasticity in the evolution of the 3R-WGD-derived duplicates,
such as an independent loss or persistence among teleost
lineages, is also shown in a recent study on androgen
receptors [33]. The persistence of these receptors in various Percomorph fishes is suggested to be responsible for

their neofunctionalization in ligand-binding activities
that may be associated with plasticity of sex determination in those teleosts. It is also interesting to explore how
the multiple stickleback PDE1Cb loci presented here have
been retained.

single- and multiple-PDE1C models

Comparison of the simulated depolarization signals
between single- and multiple-PDE1C models. Simulation results of single- and multiple-PDE1C models are shown
in the left and right panels, respectively. The x-axis indicates
the simulation time scale, and the y-axis indicates the intensity of depolarization of the olfactory receptor neutron. The
values of "threshold" indicate the firing threshold of PDE1C
in terms of their activity levels (see Figure 5C) set in the
respective simulations. Depolarization signals were obtained
using 50 replications of the respective simulation. (A)

The various stickleback chromosome segments that contain PDE1Cb1-b7 (see Figure 2) may have been retained
because of advantages related to the LSE of PDE1Cb and/
or the "unknown" genes mentioned above. LSEs are
thought to have played an important role in the proteome
evolution of multicellular eukaryotes [32], particularly in
the evolution of proteins involved in ligand recognition,
pathogen resistance, etc [34-36]. The function of the
"unknown" genes is not annotated in the Ensembl stickleback genome. However, at least a part of their corresponding human genes is suggested to function as an
angiotensin II/arginine vasopressin (AII/AVP) receptorlike protein responsible for an autoimmune disease (cold
autoinflammatory syndrome) (found by a BLASTP search;
data not shown). The "unknown" stickleback genes may
also have immune-related functions. The repeated segmental duplication of these "unknown" genes (see Figure
2) might be advantageous in stickleback responses to
diverse pathogens or other ligands. This possibility should
be examined further. On the other hand, the stickleback
PDE1Cb genes are intact and do not have stop codons or
frameshifts in their coding sequences. Thus, they should
also have been allowed to be highly duplicated. Accordingly, the PDE1Cb genes in stickleback may also have
important phenotypic consequences; for this reason, we
analyzed their molecular evolution, gene expression, and
possible gene dosage effects, as discussed below.
Sequence and expression evolution of the multiple
stickleback PDE1C genes
The sequence evolution analysis of the multiple PDE1Cb
genes in stickleback did not provide strong evidence for
neofunctionalization [1,2] in their coding proteins. The
known active sites and specific domains/motifs of PDE
enzymes were highly conserved among the multiple
PDE1Cb genes (Figure 3). In addition, although the MLestimation of the dN/dS ratio implied adaptive sequence
evolution in the case of LRT-1 (Table 1), the estimated
positively-selected amino acid sites are located on the
opposite side of a substrate-binding pocket of the PDE1
[see Additional file 1: Figure S2] and these positivelyselected sites are included in the sequence region for
which the possible function is not reported (see Results).
From these observations, we can hardly conclude that the
multiple PDE1Cb genes were maintained through the
acquisition of new enzyme functions. This implies that
evolutionary mechanisms other than neofunctionalization in coding sequence may have retained the multiple
stickleback PDE1C genes.

Gene expression analysis (Figure 4) showed that the
PDE1Ca and relatively "basal" PDE1Cb genes (see Figure
1B; designated as "group I" in Figure 4) were strongly
expressed in a few (0–3) tissues, and their expression patterns were similar to G(olf). Since PDE1C and G(olf) are
involved in the OT [20,21,37], expression patterns of
these basal ("group I") PDE1Cb genes seem to represent
ancestral states of the teleost PDE1Cb. This might be verified by further expression analysis on the PDE1Cb from
many other teleosts in the future. On the other hand, the
"derived" PDE1Cb genes (designated as "group II" in Figure 4) were strongly expressed in many more tissues,
implying that they acquired expression in new organs.
These PDE1Cb genes, which seem to be neofunctionalized in terms of expression patterns, may be under functional adaptation to their new subcellular environments.
Furthermore, they might experience neofunctionalization
through the acquisition of new mutations in the future.
In addition, the number of PDE1C loci involved in the
stickleback OT seems to be increased, as suggested by the
fact that at least seven PDE1C isoforms were co-expressed
with G(olf) in the stickleback nose (Figure 4). Such an
increase in PDE1C gene products may have some functional significance in the performance of the OT. However, directly addressing this question is difficult within
the scope of this study, because it would require gene
knockout, neurophysiological, and behavioral analyses.
Furthermore, gene expression levels of the PDE1C would
be assessed more quantitatively by a real-time PCR
approach. Such an approach will also useful to explore the
existence of gene number variation of PDE1C within and
between populations of stickleback, which includes a variety of ecomorphs (e.g., marine, anadromous, and freshwater populations) [22,23] in the future. To obtain and
describe the primary predictions of the phenotypic effects
from increased PDE1C dosage, we used in silico pathway
simulations, as discussed below.
Possible effect of increased PDE1C products on olfactory
transduction
The effect of increased PDE1C dosage on stickleback OT
was surveyed using in silico pathway simulation. The simulation was based on limited information and knowledge
of OT, and the predictions resulting from the simulation
should be empirically evaluated. Regardless, such
approaches may provide insight into the evolutionary significance of the multiple PDE1C genes in the stickleback.

According to the results of the OT simulation, the
increased PDE1C dosage extends the longevity of the
depolarization signal of the olfactory receptor neuron
(Figure 6). PDE1C is involved in the negative feedback circuit of the OT and decomposes cyclic adenylic acid
(cAMP) and eventually terminates the depolarization

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/23

depending on upstream Ca2+/CaM [20,21,38] (see Figure
5). Accordingly, the increased PDE1C products may compete with each other for binding to these upstream Ca2+/
CaM molecules, and consequently delay the termination
of depolarization (Figure 6C and 6D). This proposed
delay mechanism seems to be supported from our additional simulation results that Ca2+/CaM limitation further
extends the longevity of the depolarization signal (Figure
6E and 6F). Competition among the increased PDE1Cs
involved in the negative feedback circuit may result in
positive feedback in the OT system to be dominant. This
situation would also elongate the depolarization signal.
Our in silico mutation-simulation analysis supported this
hypothesis (Figure 6G and 6H). That is, a defect in the
positive feedback circuit antagonized the effect of the
increased PDE1C dosage, suppressing the depolarization
elongation. To summarize, our simulation analyses suggested that increased PDE1C dosage induces competition
among PDE1Cs and causes the positive feedback loop to
be dominant in the OT system, resulting in a delay in the
termination of the output depolarization of the olfactory
receptor neuron.
It is proposed that an extension in the duration of olfactory signals is associated with the territorial ecology of the
house mouse Mus domesticus [39]. In M. domesticus, the
male scent mark contains lipocalin proteins called major
urinary proteins (MUPs). The MUPs bind with the semiochemical molecules and release them gradually, which
eventually extends the longevity of the odor signal. This
makes it difficult for other male mice to tell whether the
odor signals come from scent marks or a territorial male,
and the other males are hesitant to approach the territorial
zone because the scent-mark odor has an aggressive message. This is thought to be evolutionarily advantageous for
both the territorial and the other individual because
potential male invaders reduce their risk of damage or
death due to conflict [39]. Although this phenomenon
and the underlying mechanisms in house mice are different from those proposed for the stickleback, the multiple
PDE1C genes may play an important role in stickleback
ecology and behavior. This speculation may be appealing
when considering that sticklebacks also hold territories
where they build nests and reproduce.
Of course, these hypotheses should be empirically examined. Additionally, the application of the vertebrate OT
system described in the KEGG [31] to this stickleback
study should be verified in future research. However, we
propose that the evolutionary significance of multiple
gene duplicates may be evaluated more comprehensively
using available biological information and analytical
tools such as whole genome sequences, pathway data, and
in silico simulation software, as was attempted here. Such
a comprehensive approach would be particularly favora-

ble for questions that are not entirely addressed using the
molecular evolutionary analysis of a particular gene/protein. For example, this approach could be used in testing
the effects of increased gene dosage in signal transduction
pathways. With improvements in the pathway models
and their parameters, the in silico pathway simulation,
which can perform a synthetic analysis of molecular
dynamics for multiple gene products and other biomolecules, will become one of the most powerful approaches
in understanding complex macro-phenotypic evolution.

Conclusion
In this paper, we presented the results of a comprehensive
analysis of the evolution of multiple PDE1C genes in the
stickleback involved in a cAMP-mediated signal transduction pathway. Our results suggested that the PDE1C genes
are evolutionary significant through either their diversification in expression among organs and/or through an
increased gene dosage effect on the olfactory transduction
pathway, rather than through neofunctionalization of
their coding sequences. In particular, in silico simulation
analysis implied that an increase of PDE1C dosage
extends the longevity of olfactory signals. An increase in
gene product may have a substantial effect on the functions of subcellular networks.

Methods
Phylogenetic analysis
To analyze the evolutionary origins and relationships of
the multiple PDE1C genes in the stickleback, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of PDE1C and its closely
related PDE1A genes from eight chordate species (human,
chicken, frog, pufferfish, medaka, stickleback, zebrafish,
and ascidian) using available whole-genome sequence
data. The primary sequences of the PDE1 genes were gathered via queries to the Ensembl genome database [40] and
its Ortholog Predictions section. We confirmed that no
additional PDE1A and PDE1C genes existed in these
genomic sequences using BLAST searches (E-value cut-off
of < 10-3). When a partial sequence was detected in the
Ensembl database, we predicted the full-length coding
sequence from the genomic sequence using WISE2 [41].
The corresponding PDE1 of the sea lamprey Petromyzon
marinus was searched using BLAST against the UCSC
Genome Browser Database [42]. However, we were unable to find the full length sequence, which can be used as
an outgroup for the phylogenetic analysis. The species
names and Ensembl IDs of the analyzed PDE1A and
PDE1C genes are provided in supplementary table S2 [see
Additional file 1].

The nucleotide sequences of the PDE1A and PDE1C genes
from the seven vertebrates and ascidian (outgroup) were
aligned using ClustalW [43]. The alignment was manually
adjusted according to the amino acid sequences using

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/23

MacClade ver. 4.06 [44]. After removing the gaps, 930 bp
of the PDE1 coding region were phylogenetically analyzed
using maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian methods
in TREEFINDER (version June, 2007) [45,46] and
MrBayes (version 3.0b4) [47] under the GTR + I + Γ model
[48], which was selected as the best-fitting model for
nucleotide substitution by hierarchical LRT (hLRT) [49].
The ML analysis was assessed using 1000 replications of
the LR-ELW edge support tests [24]. Bayesian posterior
probabilities of the phylogeny and its branches were
determined from 9901 trees. The re-aligned teleost
PDE1C genes (1248 bp), excluding the partial zebrafish
PDE1Ca (1185 bp), were analyzed using the ML method
under the TrN + Γ model of nucleotide substitution [50],
which was chosen by the hLRT. Bayesian method was not
applied to this analysis, because MrBayes does not allow
to use the TrN model.
Synteny analysis
To investigate the chromosomal/genomic events that generated multiple PDE1C genes in the stickleback, genomic
regions around the stickleback PDE1C loci were investigated and compared to those of human, chicken, frog,
pufferfish, medaka, and zebrafish. Physical mapping data
nearby each PDE1C locus were obtained from the
Ensembl database [40]. An orthology of the neighboring
genes [see Additional file 1: Table S1] within each species
was examined according to descriptions in the Orthologous Prediction section of Ensembl database. Phylogenetic relationships of a part of neighboring genes of the
stickleback PDE1Cb loci were analyzed by ML method
according to the procedure described above [see Additional file 1: Figure S1]. The genomic location data of the
genes near the PDE1C genes were used to rebuild the synteny maps.
Molecular evolutionary analysis
To examine whether the multiple PDE1C genes in the
stickleback were subjected to diversifying selection in
terms of their amino acid sequences, we analyzed the dN/
dS ratio (ω) using ML inferences of the ω values in codeml
[25]. The re-aligned teleost PDE1C genes (1248 bp; 416
codons) were analyzed, excluding the partial zebrafish
PDE1Ca (1185 bp) gene. An ML tree of these teleost
PDE1C genes (shown in Figure 1B) was used as a reference
tree. In this analysis, a simple ML model was compared to
a more complex model having more parameters to obtain
an adequate ω estimate. Statistical significance of the comparisons was assessed by LRT with degrees of freedom
equal to the differences in the number of free parameters
between the two models. First, the one-ratio model (M0),
which assumes a one ω (ω0:0 < ω0<1) for all codon sites,
was compared to the discrete model (M3), which assumes
three ω (ω0, ω1, and ω2) for three site classes with proportions p0, p1, and p2. Second, the neutral model (M1),

BMC Systems Biology 2009, 3:23

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/23

which assumes conserved sites (0<ω0<1) and neutral sites
(ω1 = 1) with proportions p0 and p1 (p1 = 1-p0) was compared to the selection model (M2), which assumes the
conserved, neutral, and selection sites with proportions
p0, p1, and p2. The ω value of the selection sites (ω2) was
allowed to be greater than 1. Third, the beta model (M7),
which assumes that the ω varies according to the beta distribution β (p, q), was compared to the beta and ω model
(M8), which assumes an additional site class with a ω
value >1.

(RT)-PCR analysis. The gene-specific primers (GSPs)
designed and used are described in Table 2. To distinguish
the multiple PDE1C loci in stickleback, the 3' region of at
least one primer from each primer pair was made to locate
the differential nucleotide site among the PDE1C genes.
For amplification of the G(olf) cDNA, a GSP pair was
designed according to the nucleotide sequences of the
stickleback G(olf) described in Ensembl (Ensembl Gene
ID: ENSGACG00000016605 and ENSGACG000000
01155).

In addition, we performed a "branch-site test" [26] to
detect positive selection at individual codon sites, if it
exists, along respective branches leading to the multiple
PDE1C genes of the stickleback. For this purpose, we set
branches connecting the multiple PDE1C genes of the
stickleback as "foreground" branches. The other branches
leading to the pufferfish and medaka PDE1C genes were
considered "background" branches. To obtain the adequate proportion estimates of site classes and their ω values, the selection model (M2) and discrete model (M3)
were compared on the basis of their log-likelihood scores
(l) estimated using codeml. Individual codon sites were
assessed in terms of their posterior probability to belong
to the site class for which the ω value was allowed to be
>1.

For the RT-PCR experiment, we used two adults of the
anadromous form of the three-spine stickleback. Live
specimens were collected at Akkeshi Lake, Hokkaido,
Japan, in May 2008, and were treated according to the ethical recommendations of the Ichthyological Society of
Japan and the University of Tokyo. Total RNA was
extracted from the lip, nose, gill raker, brain, heart, liver,
intestine, skin, and skeletal muscle of fresh stickleback
samples, using 1 ml TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen). Residual genomic DNA was removed using DNase I (Takara),
and 168 ng of the repurified total RNA from each tissue
were reverse-transcribed into first-strand cDNA with
oligo-dT adaptor primer using TaKaRa RNA PCR kit ver.
3.0 (Takara). Genomic DNA was also extracted from a
piece approximately 5 mg in size of the caudal fins using
the AquaPure DNA extraction kit (BioRad).

RT-PCR based co-expression analysis
To examine whether the multiple PDE1C genes in stickleback were involved in olfactory transduction (OT), we
investigated the co-expression of the PDE1C genes and
the G(olf) using semi-quantitative reverse transcription

To assess the expression patterns of the PDE1C and G(olf)
genes across tissues, reverse-transcribed cDNA from each
tissue was subjected to PCR reactions with the GSPs
(Table 2). The thermal-cycle profile was as follows: 1 cycle

at 94°C for 2 min; 35 cycles at 94°C for 30 sec, 55°C for
30 sec, and 72°C for 30 sec; followed by 1 cycle at 72°C
for 3 min. As a positive control for gene expression, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was
amplified using a primer pair designed by Aoki et al. [51].
As a negative control, PCR amplification was also conducted for each RNA sample without a reverse-transcribed
reaction. The amplified DNA fragments were separated by
electrophoresis on a 2% LO3 agarose gel (TaKaRa; 35 min
at 50 V; constant voltage setting), stained with ethidium
bromide, and visualized under UV light. GeneRuler 100-

bp DNA Ladder Plus (MBI Fermentas) was used as a size
marker.
Pathway simulation
We examined the possible effect of the multiple PDE1C
genes on the output (depolarization) of the OT system
using in silico pathway simulation. As the modeling framework for the simulation, we chose Hybrid Functional Petri
Net (HFPN [52]) because it can capture both discrete and
continuous behaviors of proteins and other molecules
simultaneously in a single simulation model. A simula-

tion model of the OT system was constructed according to
the information provided in the KEGG pathway database
[31] using the Cell Illustrator software version 3.0 [53]
with which the HFPN models can be simulated. Table 3
shows the list of elements (i.e., proteins and other molecules), processes (e.g., activation, suppression, ion transportation), and their parameters (e.g., initial
concentration, firing threshold) incorporated into the OT
model.
Since the exact parameter settings in modeling biological
pathways are generally difficult because of the limited
amount of available experimental data [54], we took a
simple approach in constructing the OT model. In this
approach, almost all parameters in the model were set to
the default values (threshold = 0 and no priority) apart
from some exceptions explained in the caption of Table 3.
After confirming that the odorants successfully elicit
depolarization of the olfactory receptor neuron modeled
in the OT simulation, we assessed the intensity and longevity of the depolarization signals in the following situations: (i) PDE1C circuit is single (single-PDE1C model);
(ii) the number of PDE1C circuits was increased according
to the number of OT-involving PDE1C genes in the stickleback estimated by the RT-PCR-based analysis of coexpression with G(olf) (multiple-PDE1C model); and (iii)
Ca2+ ion is limited by adding the degradation process of
Ca2+ (Ca2+-limited model). To further examine the predicted effect of the multiple PDE1C genes on the negative
feedback loops and depolarization signals, we performed
an in silico mutation analysis, where the elements and
processes involved in the positive feedback loop were
knocked out. The cell system markup language (CSML)
files of the OT models constructed and used in the analyses are available online [see Additional file 2].
