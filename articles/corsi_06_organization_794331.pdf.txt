Abstract
Background: Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase critical for processes
ranging from embryo development to cancer progression. Although isoforms with specific
molecular and functional properties have been characterized in rodents and chicken, the
organization of FAK gene throughout phylogeny and its potential to generate multiple isoforms are
not well understood. Here, we study the phylogeny of FAK, the organization of its gene, and its
post-transcriptional processing in rodents and human.
Results: A single orthologue of FAK and the related PYK2 was found in non-vertebrate species.
Gene duplication probably occurred in deuterostomes after the echinoderma embranchment,
leading to the evolution of PYK2 with distinct properties. The amino acid sequence of FAK and
PYK2 is conserved in their functional domains but not in their linker regions, with the absence of
autophosphorylation site in C. elegans. Comparison of mouse and human FAK genes revealed the
existence of multiple combinations of conserved and non-conserved 5'-untranslated exons in FAK
transcripts suggesting a complex regulation of their expression. Four alternatively spliced coding
exons (13, 14, 16, and 31), previously described in rodents, are highly conserved in vertebrates.
Cis-regulatory elements known to regulate alternative splicing were found in conserved alternative
exons of FAK or in the flanking introns. In contrast, other reported human variant exons were
restricted to Homo sapiens, and, in some cases, other primates. Several of these non-conserved
exons may correspond to transposable elements. The inclusion of conserved alternative exons was
examined by RT-PCR in mouse and human brain during development. Inclusion of exons 14 and 16
peaked at the end of embryonic life, whereas inclusion of exon 13 increased steadily until
adulthood. Study of various tissues showed that inclusion of these exons also occurred,
independently from each other, in a tissue-specific fashion.
Conclusion: The alternative coding exons 13, 14, 16, and 31 are highly conserved in vertebrates
and their inclusion in mRNA is tightly but independently regulated. These exons may therefore be
crucial for FAK function in specific tissues or during development. Conversely pathological
disturbance of the expression of FAK and of its isoforms could lead to abnormal cellular regulation.

Background
Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a non-receptor tyrosine
kinase highly enriched in focal adhesions [1,2]. FAK is
activated following integrins engagement or stimulation
of a variety of transmembrane receptors [3]. FAK is closely
related (45% amino acid identity) to proline-rich tyrosine
kinase 2 (PYK2, [4]), also known as cell adhesion kinase
β (CAK β, [5]), related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase
(RAFTK, [6]), or calcium dependent protein tyrosine
kinase (CADTK, [7]).
FAK comprises three well-defined domains: an N-terminal four-point-one, ezrin, radixin, moesin (FERM domain
see [8,9]), a central catalytic domain, and a C-terminal
focal adhesion targeting (FAT) domain, necessary and sufficient for the recruitment of FAK to focal adhesions [10].
The structure of these 3 domains has been experimentally
determined [11-13]. In mammals or chick the FERM and
kinase domains are joined by a short linker (~44 residues)
containing a proline-rich motif (PR1), which binds SH3
domains of several proteins including Src and Trio [1416], and the autophosphorylated Tyr-397 [17-19]. The
kinase and FAT domains are joined by a relatively long,
poorly characterized, region of ~233 residues containing
two proline-rich motifs (PR2, PR3), which provide the
basis for many SH3-mediated protein-protein interactions
of FAK [3].
FAK is ubiquitously expressed in adult tissues and plays a
critical role during embryogenesis as indicated by the
lethality of its deletion at 8.5 embryonic days in mice [20].
FAK regulates major cellular functions including migration, spreading, cell cycle progression and survival in
numerous cell types [21]. FAK is important in brain development [22,23] and appears to play a critical role in the
formation of tumors and in malignancy of cancer cells,
controlling their invasive and metastatic capacities (see
[24]). PYK2 is functionally distinct as it is involved in signalling pathways initiated by extracellular signals that elevate intracellular calcium concentration and by stressful
stimuli (reviews in [25,26]).
FAK is activated by autophosphorylation of Tyr-397
which recruits several SH2 domain containing proteins
including Src family kinases (see refs in [25]). Phosphorylation of other tyrosine residues in FAK by these kinases
increases its activity and promotes the recruitment and
phosphorylation of associated proteins (review in [27]).
Thus, FAK acts as an autophosphorylation-regulated scaffolding protein, which triggers the assembly of multimolecular complexes regulating downstream signalling
cascades such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAP-kinase) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3kinase) pathways.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/198

FAK has been highly conserved through evolution. FAK
orthologues regulate cell adhesion and migration in drosophila [28-32] and sea urchin [33] and play an essential
role in the morphogenesis of zebrafish [34,35]. In some
species, multiple FAK transcripts resulting from alternative splicing and/or promoter usage have been characterized. An alternative internal promoter has been identified
in chicken and mouse [36,37]. Transcription from this
alternative promoter results in the production of a truncated isoform of FAK, lacking its N-terminal and catalytic
domains, termed FRNK (FAK-related non-kinase) [36].
FRNK acts as a dominant negative, inhibiting numerous
effects of FAK [21]. Interestingly an N-terminal-truncated
form of PYK2, named PRNK (PYK2-related non kinase),
has also been reported [38].
Cloning FAK transcripts from rat brain revealed the existence of various 5'-leader sequences, and alternative splice
variants predicting changes in the amino acid sequence of
FAK [39,40]. These alternative exons code for small peptides located either just before the FAT domain (3 residues: Pro-Trp-Arg defining the FAK+ isoform), or on either
side of the autophosphorylated Tyr-397 (boxes 28, 6 and
7, in reference to the number of amino acids encoded by
these exons). FAK isoforms including boxes 6 and 7
(FAK6,7) have a much higher autophosphorylation on Tyr397 than the "standard" isoform (FAK0), which does not
include them [40-42]. FAK+6,7 is the predominant isoform
in rat and mouse brain [40,41]. In addition, a study in
human reported the possible existence of other mRNA
variants of FAK, which could potentially lead to the translation of truncated FAK proteins [43]. The expression of
multiple isoforms of FAK provides a potential for multiple
regulations and/or functions in specific cell types and/or
in pathological conditions including cancer.
The aim of the present study was to take advantage of the
available genomic sequence information from multiple
species to better define the organization of FAK gene.
Using sequence analysis and RT-PCR we then examined
the existence and conservation of various putative variants
of FAK transcripts. Finally, we investigated thoroughly in
rodent and human tissues the expression pattern of conserved alternative splicing likely to be biologically significant.

Results
Phylogeny of FAK family kinases
FAK cDNA and/or genomic sequences are known in several vertebrate and non-vertebrate species. PYK2, which
shares around 45% amino acid identity with FAK, has
been identified in mammals [4-7]. FAK gene is referred to
as Ptk2 or Ptk2a, and PYK2 gene as Ptk2b. Ptk2a and Ptk2b
are both located on chromosome 8 in human (locus
8q24-qter and 8p21.1 respectively) and chimpanzee, but

these two genes are not syntenic in other mammalian species. A recent phylogenetic study of FAK family suggested
that its common ancestor with PYK2 was very ancient
[33]. We took advantage of the availability of sequence
information in an increasing number of species, to reinvestigate the overall phylogenetic relationships between
FAK family members and PYK2. We aligned FAK and
PYK2 sequences from 16 species (see additional file 1)
and used a computerized method (Gblocks) that eliminates poorly aligned positions and divergent regions that
may not be homologous or may have been saturated by
multiple substitutions [44]. Thus, our analysis was performed on blocks of positions distributed across the full
length FAK and PYK2 sequences. The phylogenic tree
resulting from a maximum likelihood analysis based on
these blocks of sequence is shown in Fig. 1. The tree suggests that gene duplication leading to the appearance of
FAK and PYK2 occurred after the urochordate (Ciona intes-

tinalis) branch since distinct clusters of FAK and PYK2 proteins are only observed in vertebrates. Furthermore, the
vertebrate FAK genes are more closely related to the common ancestor than PYK2 genes, suggesting that PYK2 was
subjected to less evolutionary pressure. The global tree
topology obtained with the maximum likelihood analysis
was reproduced using the distance method analysis (see
Methods section) on FAK complete amino acid sequence
(with or without Gblocks sequence alignment processing)
and on isolated FERM or kinase domains (data not
shown). Interestingly, the zebrafish genome includes two
distinct and likely functional FAK genes [34,35] presumably resulting from genome duplication [45]. Similarly two
FAK genes are predicted in fugu genome (Ensembl V38).
In most analysis fugu FAK proteins formed a distinct
monophyletic group supporting independent duplication
in each fish species (Fig. 1). However, maximun likelihood analysis with FERM domain indicated fugu FAK2

and zebrafish FAK1a as monophyletic, suggesting that
these proteins are orthologues and that FAK gene was
duplicated before emergence of these two fish species, in
agreement with the usual view of early genome duplication in this clade [45]. Altogether, these data suggest that
vertebrate FAK family members evolved from a common
ancestral gene, which was duplicated in deuterostomes
after the echinoderma embranchment, leading to the evolution of PYK2 with distinct properties. Thus, FAK and
PYK2 appear to be coded by paralogous genes in vertebrates.
FAK is conserved in vertebrate and non-vertebrate species
(see additional file 1). The most conserved domain is the
kinase domain (lowest sequence identity: e.g. human vs
C. elegans: 50 %) followed by the FERM domain (lowest
sequence identity: e.g. human vs C. elegans = 24 %). The
C. elegans orthologue of FAK appears to be the most divergent. The human FAT domain has only 18% amino acid
identity with the C-terminus of the C. elegans sequence.
However, hydrophobic cluster analysis [46] revealed that
the nematode FAK C-terminal region has an organization
similar to that of human FAT (data not shown), suggesting that it corresponds to a bona fide FAT domain. The
sequence of the linker regions between FERM and kinase
domains, and between kinase and FAT domains (Fig. 2
and see additional file 1) is less conserved. The FERMkinase linker contains a conserved sequence in FAK and
PYK2, (S/T)(D/E)DYAEI, with a tyrosine that has been
shown to be autophosphorylated in mammals and drosophila. This sequence is absent, however, from the available genomic sequence of C. elegans FAK orthologue (see

Organization of murine and human FAK genes
We then focused our study on mammalian FAK, and to
obtain more insights into the organization of its gene we
compared in detail its sequence in human and rodents.
FAK and FRNK promoters
FAK promoter has been characterized in human [47],
while the internal FRNK promoter has been identified in
chicken and mouse [36,37]. We identified the orthologous mouse FAK and human FRNK promoters (see additional files 2, 3 and 4). Pairwise conservation analysis of
these sequences showed 2 evolutionary conserved regions
(ECR, more than 70% identity) in FAK promoter region
(additional file 3). In FRNK promoter, we identified a
novel ECR (ECR3, additional file 4) located upstream
from the previously reported ones [48]. We searched FAK
and FRNK promoters for conserved transcription factors
binding sites, and identified novel putative binding sites
(see additional files 3 and 4), in addition to those previously reported [47,48].

The linker region between kinase and FAT domains is the
most variable region, and contains insertions in some species, which are longest in echinoderma (sea urchin), cniderias (hydra and hydractinia) and arthropods
(drosophila, mosquito and honeybee). Interestingly the
C. elegans predicted sequence does not encompass proline-rich motifs in this region (additional file 1).

FAK 5'-untranslated region
We next investigated the genomic organization of the 5'untranslated region. This region is important since in
most cases the rate limiting step of translation is initiation, which implicates the 5'-untranslated region (UTR)
[49]. FAK transcripts cloned from rat brain revealed several 5'-leader sequences containing various combinations
of five sequences termed boxes A-E [39] (sequence E was
later shown likely to be a cloning artifact, Studler and
Girault unpublished observations). We aligned the
murine and human 5' UTR sequences of the FAK transcripts reported in either mRNA or EST databases (Fig. 3A
and 3B) and localized them in the murine and human
FAK gene (see additional file 2). All reported transcripts
contain box A, which is the untranslated 5' part of the first
coding exon. Murine transcripts contain various combinations of 5' UTR sequences corresponding to six previously
annotated exons (NCBI and Ensembl databases) (Fig.
3A). Comparison of human sequences revealed the existence of at least eight exons, three of which have been
annotated (Fig. 3B). We numbered the four exons conserved between human and mouse as exons -1, -2, -3 and
-4 (in order of increasing distance from the translation initiation site). Boxes B, C and D, previously characterized in
rat, correspond to exons -1, -3 and -4 respectively (Fig. 3).
Exon -3 is present in the human gene, but has not yet been
reported in any transcript in that species (Fig. 3). The two
other mouse 5'-untranslated exons are not conserved in
human and we annotated them as -2aM and -2bM. Conversely, four human untranslated exons are not conserved
in mouse FAK gene and we numbered them as exons 2aH, -2bH, -3aH, and -3bH (Fig. 3B). The homology of
exons -2aM, -3aH and -3bH with various SINE/ALU
repeated sequences (data not shown) suggests they are
part of mobile elements, an observation which may
account for their lack of evolutionary conservation. Altogether these results identify five novel putative 5'-untranslated exons (-3aH, -3, -2bH, -2aH and -1) upstream from
the canonical initiation codon of the human FAK gene.
Our results suggest a complex regulation of exons inclusion/exclusion at the 5' end of FAK mRNA, which may be
important in their localization, stability and/or expression. All the mouse transcripts detailed in Fig. 3A contain
the conserved exon -4. It is noteworthy that all the human
and mouse transcripts detailed in Fig. 3A and 3B are compatible with the existence of a single promoter region (see
above) adjacent to exon -4 in both species (Fig. 3) as proposed by Golubovskaya et al [47] for human FAK.
FAK coding sequence
Concerning the coding sequence, 34 exons are annotated
in human (NCBI Gene ID: 5747) (see additional file 5)
and rat (NCBI Gene ID: 25614) FAK genes, including
those coding for boxes 28, 6, 7 and Pro-Trp-Arg (PWR,
characterizing FAK+). In contrast, the exon encoding PWR

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/198

has not been annotated in the mouse gene (NCBI Gene
ID: 14083), although isoforms containing this peptide
have been characterized in mouse [39]. We examined the
sequence of the mouse FAK gene and identified an exon
encoding PWR. We therefore propose a consistent annotation of human and mouse FAK genes, and number exons
encoding boxes 28, 6, 7 and PWR as exons 13, 14, 16 and
31 respectively, in both genes (Fig. 2 and see additional
files 2 and 6).
Conserved alternative splicing of FAK coding sequence
Several alternative exons coding for short peptides have
been reported in rat and mouse FAK [39,40]. Exons 13,
14, 16 and 31 are conserved in mouse, rat and human,
and their presence, except for exon 13, has also been
reported in transcripts from frog [50,51]. We examined
the presence of these exons in the FAK genes of Homo sapiens, chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), dog (Canis familiaris),
chicken (Gallus gallus), frog (Xenopus laevis and Xenopus
tropicalis), fugu (Takifugu rubripes), and zebrafish (Danio
rerio). We identified exons 14, 16 and 31 in the FAK
genomic sequences of chimpanzee, dog, chicken, frog,
fugu, and zebrafish, with more than 80% identity in their
nucleotide sequences (Fig. 4A). This corresponds to 60–
80% amino acids identity for boxes 6 and 7 and 100% for
PWR (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, exon 16 was found in only
one FAK zebrafish gene (zebrafish 1a). Exon 13 (encoding
box 28) was found in the genomic sequences from dog
and chicken and in only one FAK gene from zebrafish
(zebrafish 1b) and fugu (fugu1) (80% identity for nucleotides and amino acids sequences) (Fig. 4A and 4B). We
could not conclude about the presence of exon 13 in frog
since FAK gene sequence is incomplete in this species.
None of these alternative exons could be identified in
non-vertebrate species, suggesting that alternative exons
13, 14, 16 and 31 appeared in a common ancestor of vertebrates. The high degree of conservation of nucleotide
and amino acid sequences supports an important physiological role of FAK isoforms containing these alternative
spliced exons.
Putative additional variant FAK transcripts
As mentioned above two products, FAK and FRNK, are
transcribed and translated from FAK gene and more variety is generated by alternative splicing of four highly conserved exons. In addition to these well characterized gene
products, a number of cDNAs and ESTs have been
reported that include additional variations. In particular,
several human FAK transcripts containing various deletions and/or insertions have been reported in different tissues (Table 1). Some of these transcripts would encode
putative proteins with interesting predicted properties.
Alternatively, these variant transcripts could correspond
to regulatory mechanisms at the mRNA level including
nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) [52]. We first examined

may have resulted from chromosomal abnormality in the
source material.
We then analyzed human adult brain RNA by RT-PCR to
search for the presence of FAK transcripts containing other
reported modifications compatible with the genomic
sequence (Table 1). One transcript identified in stomach
[Refseq:NM_005607] included an additional 77 nt
sequence 5' of the canonical exon 1 of FAK (Table 1). This
transcript corresponds to the splicing of exon -3bH (Fig.
3) with exon 1. Although exon -3bH is also found in the
chimpanzee FAK gene, it has not been reported in any
transcript in that species. Interestingly, exon -3bH contains an ATG in frame with FAK open reading frame
(ORF), which would give rise to a 25-amino acid N-terminal elongation of FAK [Refseq:NP_005598] (Table 1).

However, this ATG diverges from the canonical consensus
sequence [53] and its use remains to be demonstrated.
PCR reactions using a forward primer spanning the
boundary between exons -3bH and 1 (primer H-F(-3bH))
and a reverse primer spanning the boundary between
exons 5 and 6 (H-R1) did not yield bona fide amplification
products, suggesting that this exon is not included in adult
human brain FAK transcripts (data not shown).
A FAK transcript truncated of the first 14 exons and containing an additional 135 nucleotides sequence 5' of exon
15 has been isolated from human hippocampus mRNA
[GenBank: BC028733]. This additional sequence was also
reported in several macaque transcripts (Table 1) and we
identified it in intron 14, adjacent to exon 15 in the
human FAK gene (Table 1). This transcript contains a non-

canonical ATG (60 nucleotides upstream from exon 15)
in frame with FAK ORF. RT-PCR with a forward primer
located in this sequence (H-F7) and reverse primers
located in exon 18 (H-R3) amplified a fragment of the
expected size (data not shown). Its sequencing confirmed
the presence of exons 15, 17, and 18, and the absence of
exon 16 (data not shown). No PCR products were
obtained with forward primers located in various exons
upstream from exon 15 and a reverse primer located in the
additional nucleotide sequence (data not shown). Thus,
this transcript could correspond to an alternative splice
variant, or be generated from an alternative promoter
located in intron 14. At any rate, our results demonstrate
that this transcript is expressed in adult human brain. If
translated, it would encode a FAK isoform deleted of the
FERM domain, but possibly containing a 20-residue Nterminal extension [GenBank: AAH28733] (Table 1).
FAK transcripts containing an in-frame insertion of 85
nucleotides in the catalytic domain have been reported in
human brain [43]. As expected we localized this sequence
between exons 18 and 19 in the human FAK gene and
annotated it as exon 18a (Fig. 2, Table 1 and see additional files 2 and 6). Exon 18a is flanked by canonical
splice donor and acceptor sites. This exon is conserved in
Homo sapiens and Pan troglodytes genomes, although in
both species two nucleotides are missing as compared to
the published human cDNA sequence, predicting a frame
shift and the insertion of a stop codon in exon 19 (Table
1). Sequencing of PCR products (primers H-F9/H-R4)
obtained from adult human brain cDNAs confirmed the
existence of exon 18a, the nucleotides deletion and the
frame shift (data not shown).
A 3' truncated FAK transcript cloned from human brain
and characterized by a 91-nucleotide insertion was also
reported [43]. We localized this additional sequence,
which contains an in-frame stop codon, between exons 23
and 24, and we annotated it as exon 23a (Fig. 2, Table 1
and see additional files 2 and 6). The presence of this exon
and its sequence were confirmed by PCR (primers H-F11/
H-R6) of human brain cDNAs (data not shown). Transcripts containing either 18A or 23A would encode C-terminally truncated isoforms of FAK (respectively
[GenBank: L05186] [Swiss-Prot: Q05397-(2, 3, 4)] and
[Swiss-Prot: Q05397-3], see also Table 1). We found
exons 18a and 23a in Pan troglodytes, but not in Mus musculus or Rattus norvegicus FAK gene. No transcript containing these sequences has yet been reported in chimpanzee.
The analysis of repeated sequences in these regions
revealed the existence of putative long interspersed elements (LINEs), an abundant class of retrotransposons
very active in the human genome [54]. Altogether our
analyses indicate that these two variant mRNAs are
present in human tissues and would lead to a truncated

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/198

protein. However, their lack of conservation suggests that
they may not be biologically important and may reflect
the unstability of the corresponding DNA regions.
A FAK transcript (containing exon 18a) in which intron
21 is not spliced at its canonical 5' border, resulting in an
additional 15 nt and a stop codon, has also been reported
in human brain [Swiss-Prot: Q05397-4] [43]. We found
this sequence at its expected localization in intron 21 of
FAK (Fig. 2). However, the human genome sequence
reveals 1 nucleotide substitution in the 15 bp additional
sequence compared to the published sequence resulting
in a C-terminal glycine instead of a glutamic acid (Table
1). Using a forward primer located in exon 18 (H-F8) and
a reverse primer (H-R5) overlapping the end of exon 21
and the additional 15 nt sequence, we obtained a PCR
product of the expected size, albeit devoid of exon 18a
(data not shown and Table 1). This transcript, similarly to
those containing exon 18a, would encode a FAK isoform
deleted of the C-terminal moiety of the protein including
most of the kinase domain.
Various FAK transcripts appear to be lacking specific
exons. A transcript missing exon 26 has been reported in
human placenta [GenBank: BC035404] and dog [RefSeq:XM 851079.1] (Table 1). Our data indicate that if this
variant is expressed in humain brain this occurs at a very
low level (primers H-F10/H-R7). In contrast, we clearly
confirmed by RT-PCR (data not shown), the expression of
another FAK variant cloned from brain [GenBank:
L05186] in which exon 28 is skipped (primers H-F12/HR8) (Table 1). No change in ORF results from the absence
of exon 28. During this study, we also found 2 other FAK
transcripts lacking either exon 2 or exon 29 (primers HF1/H-R1 and H-F12/H-R9 respectively) (Table 1). The
skipping of these exons leads to stop codons in exons 3
and 32, respectively (Table 1). It is noteworthy that deletion of exon 2 was used to generate endothelial cell-specific FAK knockout mice [55].
Altogether these results demonstrate that multiple FAK
transcripts are expressed in adult human brain (Table 1).
However, these transcripts appear to be expressed at low
levels in Homo sapiens and not to be conserved in other
species but in some cases Pan troglodytes or Macaca fascicularis. These observations suggest that these alternative
transcripts may be side products and/or play a regulatory
role in transcription.
Regulatory elements possibly involved in the control of
FAK alternative splicing
Since FAK gene products appear to undergo multiple alternative splicing, we searched for genomic elements which
might be involved in this process. Alternative inclusion/
exclusion of exons is known to be regulated by cis-regula-

Page 9 of 22

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:198

tory elements present in the exon and within the flanking
introns. Using the web-based program Acescan2, we
searched for sequences referred to as ACE-EXs which are
overrepresented in alternative evolutionary conserved
exons [56]. We observed a marked enrichment of ACE-EXs
sequences in conserved alternatively spliced exons -4, 13
and 14 (Fig. 5A). Other cis-regulatory sequences are
exonic and intronic splicing enhancers (ESE and ISE,
respectively) or silencers (ESS and ISS, respectively) that
control exon skipping by recruiting trans-acting splicing
factors [57,58]. We analyzed the human FAK gene with
the RESCUE-ESE prediction program [59] to determine
the frequency of ESE per exon and found a high score for
exon 16 (Fig. 5B). The same results were obtained by
browsing the murine FAK gene (data not shown) in which
exon 16 inclusion/exclusion is also alternatively regulated. The search for ESS with two different programs
(Acescan2 and the EBI ASD tools) [60-62] indicated the
presence of a high number of ESS in exon 14 in human
and mouse FAK gene (Fig. 5B and data not shown). Interestingly there was no enrichment of ESE or ESS in the 5'
non coding exons (Fig. 5B). On the other hand, we found
a high occurrence of the hexamer UGCAUG, a well-characterized ISE in various genes [63], in the intronic regions
between the alternatively spliced exons -2aH and -2
(intron -2aH) and between exons 13 and 14 (intron 13)
of human FAK gene (Fig. 5C). These results provide a basis
for the possible regulation of alternative inclusion/exclusion of exons located in the 5' UTR region or in the canonical coding region of human and mouse FAK gene.
Developmental regulation of alternative splicing of FAK
exons 13, 14, and 16 in mouse brain
Our study of FAK phylogeny supports the conservation in
vertebrates of alternative splicing of exons 13, 14 and 16.
Although this alternative splicing can generate theoretically 8 distinct transcripts, it is unclear which of these transcripts are actually expressed since the combination of the
various exons has not been studied systematically. To
amplify simultaneously all exons combinations, we used
RT-PCR with primers flanking this region of alternative
splicing (F2 in exon 12 and R2 spanning exons 18–19, Fig.
6A). Embryonic mouse brain mRNA at different developmental stages was first analyzed (primers M-F2 and M-R2,
Fig. 6B). We obtained multiple PCR products migrating
on agarose gels as expected for fragments containing various combinations of exons 13, 14 and 16 (Fig. 6B). In the
same RNA samples the total levels of FAK transcripts were
estimated by amplification of a constitutive fragment,
using primers M-F1 and M-R1 located in exons 7 and 9
respectively. Although the total levels of FAK appeared stable throughout development, dramatic alterations were
observed in the ratios of the various isoforms. At E12, the
short PCR product, with a size indicating it included only
exon 15, was predominant. The amplification product of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/198

~340 bp (presumably including exons 14, 15 and 16),
increased dramatically at E15 and remained the major isoform until adulthood (Fig. 6B). Longer isoforms, presumably including exon 13, were less abundant and detected
only in post-natal brain.
The use of flanking primers has the advantage to allow the
comparison of the ratios of the various isoforms between
different samples. However, it does not identify accurately
the exact combination of the various alternatively spliced
exons in FAK transcripts. To address this question we set
up an RT-PCR approach using 4 distinct forward primers
(F3, F4, F5, F6) spanning each possible exonic boundaries
immediately upstream from exon 15 and the R2 reverse
primer described above (Fig. 6A). PCR reactions with each
forward primer amplified specifically isoforms containing
one of the possible combinations of exons 13 and 14. For
each of them, the presence of exon 16 generated a distinct
longer PCR product (Fig. 6A). We analysed embryonic
mouse brain mRNA at different developmental stages
using this approach. Except for transcripts with alternative
exon 14 alone (FAKex:14,15), which were not detected at
any stage (Fig. 6C, M-F5/M-R2), our results suggest that
the expression of FAK isoforms containing the various
combinations of exons 13, 14 and 16 follows three distinct general patterns during mouse brain development
(see additional file 7): i) Transcripts containing no alternative exon (FAKex:15) or containing exon 13 alone
(FAKex:13,15) were detected at E12 and decreased during
development (Fig. 6C, M-F3/M-R2 and M-F4/M-R2); ii)
Transcripts with alternative exon 16 alone (FAKex:15,16), or
in combination with 13 or 14 (FAKex:13,15,16 and
FAKex:14,15,16), were present at E12, peaked at E20 and
tended to decrease thereafter (Fig. 6C, M-F3/M-R2, M-F5/
M-R2 and M-F4/M-R2); iii) FAK isoform combining the
three alternative exons, FAKex:13,14,15,16, was detectable at
E12 and increased steadily thereafter (Fig. 6C, M-F6/MR2) while transcripts with associated exons 13 and 14
alone (FAKex:13,14,15) followed a similar trend, at very
lower levels (Fig. 6C, M-F6/M-R2). It should be noted that
FAKex:13,15 and FAKex:13,15,16 were much less abundant than
the others, requiring 40 PCR cycles for a good detection.
To compare directly the pattern of inclusion of exons 13,
14 and 16 during development, we evaluated the total
amount of PCR products containing each of these exons
(Fig. 6D). Two patterns were clearly apparent. On the one
hand the inclusion of exon 13 was very weak at E12, and
increased gradually during development. On the other
hand inclusion of exon 14 and 16 increased rapidly
between E12 and E20 and remained stable or decreased
slightly afterwards.
Since amplification from brain tissue does not allow to
distinguish between cell types, we examined the exonic
pattern of FAK in cultured neurons. Only 5 FAK variants

Alternative splicing of FAK exons 13, 14 and 16 in mouse brain during development
Alternative splicing of FAK exons 13, 14 and 16 in mouse brain during development. (A) RT-PCR strategy. Top:
Genomic organization of the FAK gene (exons 12–19); alternatively spliced exons are boxed with dotted lines. The positions of
the primers are indicated. PCR with the flanking forward (F2) and reverse (R2) primers amplified simultaneously all exon combinations. The selective targeting of FAK alternative transcripts was achieved with specific forward primers (F3, F4, F5, F6) coupled to the R2 primer. Each forward primer targeted transcripts with only one combination of exons 12, 13, 14 and 15; the size
of the PCR product(s) distinguishes the absence or presence of exon 16 in each transcript. For each species similar primers
were used (termed according to the species and the position, see additional file 8), taking into account sequence variations. (B)
RT-PCR analysis of alternative splicing of exons 13, 14 and 16 during mouse brain development using flanking primers. The
position of molecular markers 296 bp, 335 bp and 401 bp correspond to the size of the expected PCR products for FAKex:15,
FAKex:14,15,16 and FAKex:13,15,16 respectively. The total levels of FAK transcripts were estimated by RT-PCR with primers (M-F1
and M-R1) located in constitutive exons. Amplification of GAPDH transcripts was used as a control. (C) RT-PCR monitoring
the developmental expression of alternatively spliced FAK transcripts (left panel) and their expression in E16 cortical neurons
(right panel) are shown. The number of PCR cycles used is indicated between parenthesis. (D) Pattern of inclusion of FAK
alternative exons 13, 14 and 16 during development. Quantification of PCR products was performed as described in Methods.
The inclusion of exons 13, 14 or 16 was estimated at each developmental stage by adding the normalized values of all the transcripts containing the corresponding exon and expressed as percent of the maximum.
were detected in E16 cortical neurons (Fig. 6C right lane).
The most abundant variants were FAKex:15,16, FAKex:14,15,16
and FAKex:13,14,15,16 while the detection of FAKex:13,15,16,
required 40 PCR cycles and was only detected as traces.

These results demonstrate that alternative splicing occurs
in neurons and that most variants expressed in these cells
contain exon 16. Furthermore FAKex:15 (Fig. 6C, M-F3/MR2, right lane), which is detected in whole brain RNA is

Page 12 of 22
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:198

only expressed as traces in neurons, suggesting that it
probably originates mostly from non-neuronal cells in
whole tissue.
Altogether, these results show that the inclusion of the
three alternative exons is already taking place at E12. It
increases dramatically between E12 and E15, in the case of
exons 14 and 16 coincident with the bulk of neuronal differentiation, whereas the increase is more prolonged in
the case of exon 13. This difference suggests that the mechanism regulating the inclusion of these various exons in
neurons are independent from each other.
Alternative splicing of FAK exons 13, 14, and 16 in rat
tissues
We screened various rat tissues for the expression of FAK
transcripts containing exons 13–16 with the RT-PCR
approach described above. Using primers flanking the
alternative exons (R-F2/R-R2), we detected in most tissues
a single PCR product with a migration on agarose gels
expected for a fragment devoid of alternative exons
(FAKex:15). An additional longer PCR product was detected
in skeletal muscle and testis, and two additional fragments in brain (data not shown). Total FAK transcripts
were evaluated in each tissue (R-F1/R-R1). To determine
the exact combination of alternative exons in each tissue
we used exons boundaries-specific primers (R-F3, R-F4, RF5, R-F6), as described above. Transcripts containing no
alternative exon (FAKex:15) were present in all tested tissues (Fig. 7, R-F3/R-R2). Transcripts with alternative exon
13 alone (FAKex:13,15) were detected at low levels in adrenal gland, blood, spleen, and thymus, and at very low levels in heart, liver and lung (Fig. 7, R-F4/R-R2). Transcripts
with alternative exon 14 alone (FAKex:14,15) were detected
at very low levels in testis, heart and adrenal gland (Fig. 7,
R-F5/R-R2). Transcripts with exon 16 alone (FAKex:15,16)
were highly expressed in testis and detected in brain (Fig.
7, R-F3/R-R2). FAKex:14,15,16 was detected in all tested tissues (Fig. 7, R-F5/R-R2). Transcripts with associated exons
13 and 14 (FAKex:13,14,15) were detected at very low levels
in heart (Fig. 7, R-F6/R-R2). FAKex:13,15,16 was detected in
testis, spleen, lung and brain (Fig. 7, R-F4/R-R2) and
FAKex:13,14,15,16 was detected in all tissues examined (Fig. 7,
R-F6/R-R2). As in mouse brain, the isoforms including
exon 13 appeared to be less abundant since they required
35–40 amplifications cycles. These results combined with
those obtained in mouse brain show that exons 13, 14
and 16 can be included in combination or independently
of each other. Overall three transcripts are more widely
and highly expressed than the others: FAKex:15,
FAKex:14,15,16 and FAKex:13,14,15,16. Thus, in non-neuronal
tissues FAKex:15 is the major isoform, except in testis where
FAKex:15,16 is predominant, as previously reported using
different approaches [40,41]. These results indicate that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/198

the inclusion of exons 13, 14, and 16 is tightly regulated
in a tissue-dependent fashion.
Alternative splicing of FAK exons 13, 14, and 16 in human
brain
Although alternatively spliced variants of FAK exist in
humans (see above), no information is available concerning their expression in brain. To search for FAK splice variants containing exons 13, 14 or 16 in human brain we
used the same RT-PCR approach as described above (Fig.
6A), with primers matching the human FAK nucleotide
sequence. Using primers (H-F2/H-R2) flanking exons 13,
14 and 16, we detected multiple FAK transcripts in fetal
and adult human brain RNA (Fig. 8A). In fetal brain, the
predominant PCR product corresponded to the expected
size of FAKex:14,15,16 while a band of the size of FAKex:15 was
also present (Fig. 8A). In adult brain FAKex:15 was the most
abundant variant (Fig. 8A). In both types of samples,
longer PCR products presumably including exons 13 and
14 or 16 were barely detectable (Fig. 8A).

We then performed RT-PCR with primers H-F3, H-F4, HF5, H-F6, selective of the different combinations of exons
13,14 and 16, and the reverse primer H-R2 (see Fig. 6A) to
determine precisely the expression of each FAK transcript.
In fetal human brain RNA the main transcripts amplified
were FAKex:15, FAKex:14,15,16 and FAKex:13,14,15,16 (Fig. 8B).
FAKex:15,16 and, to a lesser degree, FAKex:13,14,15 and
FAKex:13,15,16 were also detected (Fig. 8B). Interestingly, in
adult brain, although the general pattern was the same as
in fetal brain, all exons combinations were amplified,
including FAKex:14,15 and FAKex:13,15 (Fig. 8C). These
results demonstrate that alternative splicing of FAK exons
takes place in human brain, as in mouse or rat. In human
fetal brain samples, results were very similar to those in
fetal mouse brain at E15-20. In contrast, two noticeable
differences were observed in human adult brain. First, the
levels of expression of FAKex:15 appeared higher than those
of FAKex:14,15,16. This may be due to the fact that FAKex:15 is
expressed in non-neuronal cells, including glial cells,
which represented a higher proportion in adult human
tissue samples. Second, all combinations of exons were
detected, even if most of them were found at very low levels. This may indicate a larger variety of splicing mechanisms and/or cell types included in the samples.

Discussion
The present study provides a global and updated view of
the FAK family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases. FAK and
PYK2 share a high degree of amino acid sequence identity
(~45%) and nearly identical intron-exon structure (data
not shown). In contrast to a previous report [33], the phylogenetic analysis presented here suggests that PYK2 and
FAK share a common ancestor posterior to the appearance
of the echinoderm branch. This different result is proba-

bly due to the inclusion of a larger number of FAK
sequences in the present study, including cnidarian,
arthropod and urochordate sequences. The proposed
duplication event leading to the emergence of two FAK
family members is in agreement with chordate genome
evolution in which one or several duplications occurred
after the separation of craniates and cephalochordates,
before the emergence of teleosts [64,65]. The duplication
in the early stage of vertebrate evolution was also proposed for other tyrosine kinases families including platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and Src
tyrosine kinase families [66]. In addition, two FAK
sequences were found experimentally in Danio rerio [35]
and predicted in Takifugu rubripes (Ensembl V38) in agreement with the additional genome duplication in teleost

ancestors [45]. Similarly, two PYK2 genes are predicted in
Danio rerio (Ensembl V38), although only one has yet
been annotated in Takifugu rubripes (Ensembl V38). Thus,
FAK and PYK2 can be considered as paralogous genes in
vertebrates. Vertebrate FAK sequence is closer than PYK2
to FAK in urochordate, echinoderma and other non vertebrate species, suggesting that PYK2 has undergone a more
rapid evolution, presumably linked to its novel functions.
The highest degree of conservation in FAK family proteins
is found in the FERM, kinase and FAT domains, whereas
the linker regions are less conserved. Interestingly, the
autophosphorylated tyrosine and the surrounding conserved motif, in the linker between FERM and kinase
domains, is absent from C. elegans genome sequence, sug-

Alternative splicing of FAK exons 13, 14 and 16 in human brain
Alternative splicing of FAK exons 13, 14 and 16 in human brain. (A). Analysis of FAK variants by RT-PCR with flanking
primers. The position of molecular markers 296 bp and 380 bp correspond to the size of the expected PCR products for
FAKex:15, and FAKex:13,15 respectively. The expression of alternatively spliced FAK transcript was detected in human fetal (B)
and adult brain (C) by RT-PCR as described in Fig. 6A. The exons included in each PCR products reflecting the expression of

gesting that it is not essential to FAK function. The kinaseFAT linker region was also poorly conserved with multiple
insertions/deletions in various species. Not surprisingly it
is in these linker regions that conserved alternative splicing events take place in vertebrates, including around the
autophosphorylated tyrosine (exons 13, 14, 16) in FAK
and upstream from the FAT domain (exon 31) in FAK and
the short isoform of PYK2 [38,67].
We updated the annotation of murine and human genes
to take into account the conserved exons, based on the
analysis of transcripts and EST databases as well as RTPCR experiments. Murine and human FAK genes span 140
and 230 Kb respectively (see additional figure 2). The
murine and human FAK genes include at least 40 and 44
exons, respectively. Four 5'-non coding exons (-4 to -1)
and 34 coding exons (1 to 34) are conserved in both species (81–100% identity). We also show that the promoter
regions of full length FAK and FRNK, previously identified
in human and mouse, respectively [37,47] are conserved
between the two species, allowing to identify novel conserved regions of putative regulatory interest. Interestingly, the existence of two alternate gene products, full
length PYK2 and PRNK, has been reported in the case of
PYK2 [38], suggesting that the two promoters are an

ancient and conserved feature of this tyrosine kinase family.
Most of the translational control occurs at the level of initiation, implicating the 5'-untranslated (5' UTR) region as
a major site of translational regulation [49]. FAK mRNAs
cloned from rat brain contained various 5' UTR sequences
suggesting a tight translational regulation [39]. The
present work expands these results since we identified 6
murine and 8 human 5' UTR exons. Four of these exons (1, -2, -3 and -4) are highly conserved in both species (62–
87 % identity), while the remaining exons are not. Cisregulatory splicing sequences are enriched in exons -4, 2bH and in the intron between exons -2 and -2aH (intron
-2aH). We did not find any correlation between the organization of the 5' UTR and the inclusion and exclusion of
specific alternatively spliced coding exons in FAK transcripts, although a more systematic study would be necessary to draw definite conclusions.
Within the coding sequence the present study shows that
the previously described exons 13, 14, 16, and 31 are
highly conserved in vertebrates. A number of FAK transcripts containing additional sequences have been
reported, especially in human. We examined in detail
these variants to determine whether they could encode for

novel forms of FAK with interesting biological properties.
One variant transcript [GenBank: BC028733] would
encode a FAK isoform deleted of the N-terminal of FAK
but including Tyr-397 and the kinase domain. We also
characterized FAK transcripts containing modifications
that would result in various C-terminal truncations. The
presence of either exon 18a or of an extended exon 21
would encode isoforms of FAK deleted of their C-terminal
moiety and most of the kinase domain. The inclusion of
exon 23a would result in FAK isoforms containing an
intact kinase domain but deleted of the C-terminal proline-rich regions and the FAT domain. We also found transcripts lacking exon 28 (no change in ORF) or exon 29
(deletion of FAT domain). Another FAK transcript in
which exon 26 (present nomenclature) is spliced out has
been reported. This transcript is particularly interesting
since exon 26 of FAK corresponds to the exon 23 of PYK2
which is also deleted in an alternative splice variant of
PYK2 [38,67]. These exons encode residues localized in
the C-terminal region, between the proline-rich motifs
PR2 and PR3, suggesting that their deletion could have
similar functional consequences. Although we did not
detect a significant expression of this FAK transcript in
human brain, it could be expressed in other tissues similarly to the PYK2 alternative splice variant [67].
The presence of several of these variant transcripts in
human brain was supported by our RT-PCR experiments,
which showed that they are expressed at low levels, similar to FAK transcripts containing exon 13. However, exons
18a and 23a are not conserved in mouse, and non-conserved alternative splicing events are less likely to generate
functional proteins than those which are conserved [68].
Thus, it remains to be established if these species-specific
transcripts are translated into proteins in human tissues.
Transcripts containing exon 18a may be degraded since
inclusion of this exon results in a change in ORF and a
stop codon in exon 19 following the nonsense-mediated
decay (NMD) rules [52]. NMD is an mRNA surveillance
pathway responsible for the degradation of abnormal
mRNAs containing premature translation termination
codons (PTCs) which encode truncated proteins potentially harmful for the cell [69]. Altogether the lack of evolutionary conservation of these alternative FAK transcripts
does not support an important biological role. As a matter
of fact, several of these non-conserved alternatively
spliced FAK exons discussed here exhibit a strong homology with repeated elements. The 5'-untranslated exons 2aM in mouse and the human -3aH and -3bH are likely to
derive from Alu elements. The primate specific genomic
insertion of exons 18a and 23a could be the consequence
of LINE insertion. The exonization of intronic transposable elements (ALU/LINE) is a well characterized phenomenon in mouse and human and could explain the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/198

diversity and the species specificity of those FAK gene
exons [54].
Since our results highlighted a complex regulation of FAK
mRNA alternative splicing we searched in exons 13, 14, 16
and 31 and in their flanking introns for cis-regulatory
sequences, conserved in mouse and human, known to
influence alternative splice site selection [70]. Exons 13
and 14 were recognized as alternative conserved exons
according to Yeo et al [56]. We found an overrepresentation of exon splicing silencers (ESS) or enhancers (ESE) in
exons 14 and 16 respectively. We also identified, in the
intronic region between exons 13 and 14, a high frequence of a well characterized intronic splicing enhancer
sequence (UGCAUG) regulating tissue-specific alternative
exons inclusion/exclusion [63,71]. We determined that
this hexanucleotide is conserved in human, mouse, rat,
dog and chicken FAK (data not shown) suggesting that it
could be involved in the regulation of alternative splicing
of exon 13 and/or 14. Functional evidences have shown
that UGCAUG binds various tissue-specific isoforms of
mammalian Fox-1 splicing factors with a high specificity
[72,73]. Fox-1 family factors can act as splicing enhancers
or repressors depending on the tissue, the isoform, as well
as the localization of the hexanucleotide binding site
(upstream or downstream) and its distance from the targeted alternative exon. The effect of Fox isoforms on the
alternative splicing of exons 13 and 14 remains to be
established and predictions are difficult since both exons
can be alternatively spliced. However, in muscle cells Fox1 was shown to act as a splicing repressor of exons normally skipped in muscle but used in other tissues [73] and
this effect required the localization of the hexanucleotide
upstream from the targeted exon which would correspond
here to exon 14. This type of regulation could be responsible for the absence of exon 14 in FAK transcripts in some
tissues. On the other hand, the UGCAUG sequences
reported to activate splicing are located downstream from
the regulated exon [63] concerning here the exon 13 of
FAK. Furthermore, the UGCAUG sequence and various
Fox isoforms have been shown to activate the splicing of
neuron-specific alternative exons [63,71] such as the N30
exon of the non-muscle myosin heavy chain II-B [74] or
the N1 exon of Src [73]. Thus, the presence of multiple cisexonic and intronic sequences regulating positively or
negatively alternative splicing can be correlated with the
complex RT-PCR expression profile of FAK isoforms containing various combinations of exons 13, 14 and 16 that
we observed in adult tissues and during development.
The alternative exons encoding boxes 28, 6, 7 and PWR
(exons 13, 14, 16 and 31) are highly conserved in vertebrates supporting an important biological role. Here, we
demonstrate by RT-PCR that, as expected, alternative
splicing of exons 13, 14 and 16 takes place in human. The

study of the pattern of inclusion of exons 13, 14 and 16
suggests that they are independent from each other and
subjected to tissue and development-specific regulatory
mechanisms. For instance, FAKex:15(FAK0), FAKex:14,15,16
(FAK6,7) and FAKex:13,14,15,16 (FAK6,7,28) can be detected at
various levels in all tissues tested while the expression of
other exons combinations is restricted to very few tissues,
usually at very low levels (e.g. FAKex:14,15 (FAK6) in testis,
heart, and adrenal gland, and FAKex:13,14,15 (FAK28,6) in
heart). Overall, FAKex:15 (FAK0) is the most abundant transcript, except in testis and brain in which FAKex:15,16
(FAK7) and FAKex:14,15,16 (FAK6,7) respectively, are preponderant.
Our results demonstrate that the majority of transcripts
expressed during brain development or in adult brain
contain exons 14 and 16 (encoding boxes 6 and 7), in
agreement with previous results obtained with different
approaches [40]. During mouse brain development the
inclusion of these exons increases dramatically between
E12 and E15. Interestingly, this period (E12-E15) corresponds to the initial stages of cortical development in the
brain, including cortico-pial basement membrane formation and neuronal migration, both processes requiring
FAK [22,75]. The preponderance of FAK transcripts containing exons 14 and 16 in human and rodent brain is
particularly interesting since the inclusion of the corresponding peptides in FAK isoforms increases significantly
the autophosphorylation rate [40,41]. This effect results
from the relief of the inhibition by the FERM domain, and
from the ability of FAK including boxes 6 and 7 (or box 7
alone) to undergo intramolecular autophosphorylation
[41,42]. These specific properties have important consequences since they suggest that the recruitment of these
alternatively spliced FAK isoforms may lead to their autophosphorylation without requirement for the clustering
of multiple FAK molecules in contrast to what occurs in
focal adhesion. Interestingly, the expression of FAK transcripts containing exon 16 is not restricted to brain.
FAKex:15,16 is the most abundant FAK transcript in testis in
which the autophosphorylation of FAK is essential for
specific actin-based adherens junctions assembly and disassembly between Sertoli and germ cells [76].
FAKex:14,15,16 and FAKex:13,14,15,16 are also expressed,
although at a much lower level than in brain, in the other
tissues tested. The inclusion of box 6 (encoded by exon
14) also increases autophosphorylation and its effect is
additive with that of box 7 (exon 16) [41]. In contrast, the
function of box 28 in FAK is not known. Our results showing the strong evolutionary conservation of boxes 28 and
6 in vertebrates support an important functionnal role, yet
to be established.

Conclusion
The FAK gene family includes one orthologue in non-vertebrate metazoans and two paralogue genes in vertebrates,
FAK and PYK2. In vertebrates FAK is subjected to conserved alternative splicing of several non-coding and coding exons which are likely to have an important biological
function. In contrast, other variations due to non-conserved alternative splicing may be the consequence of the
presence of transposable elements in the genome and
have no function or be possibly involved in regulatory
mechanisms. FAK is known to play an important role in
human pathology, especially in cancer invasiveness and
metastasis [24]. Since alterations in splicing mechanisms
are frequent in cancer cells [77,78] it will be important to
determine whether such mechanisms could alter FAK
properties, either by modulating the mRNA levels, or by
changing the coding sequence of expressed proteins.

Methods
FAK gene annotation
New exons of FAK gene were identified and annotated
from alignment of ESTs or mRNAs with FAK genomic
sequences from human [RefSeq:NT_008046] and mouse
[RefSeq:NT_039621] using either ClustalW [79,80],
Blast2Sequences or BLASTN [81]. Exons 13, 14, 16 and 31
were searched in FAK gene from chimpanzee

[Ensembl:ENSDARG00000004672,
Ensembl:ENSDARG00000040197]. Repeated elements
were identified with the RepeatMasker program [82].
Alternative splicing regulatory elements were searched
using Rescue-ESE [59,83,84], Acescan2 [56,85] and EBI
ASD tools [60-62,86].
Phylogeny
The sequence alignment of full-length FAK and PYK2 proteins was obtained using ClustalW followed by manual
adjustments. The resulting alignment was represented
using Genedoc [87,88] (see additional file 1). Evolutionnary distant and predicted FAK sequences were used. To
avoid poorly aligned positions, conserved blocks distributed across the full length FAK sequences were selected
with the Gblocks program [44]. The phylogenetic analysis
based on Maximum Likelihood was carried out with
Phyml [89-91]. Distance analysis was performed with
Protdist to generate distance matrix and the Neighbour
Joining algorythm to infer trees [92]. Trees were drawn
with Njplot [93]. Phylogenetic studies were also performed using FERM and kinase domains alignment corresponding to residues 33 to 361 and 415 to 677 of the

human FAK sequence [Swiss-Prot: Q05397], respectively.
The phylogenetic analysis of the FAT domain (residues
914 to 1043) did not fit with known evolutionnary data
(branching of nematodes, insects and echinoderma) since
this domain is poorly conserved between the different
species. The bootstrap support values (100 replicates)

Cell culture
Primary neuronal cultures established from cerebral cortices of embryonic day 16 C57BL/6 mice were performed as
previously described [94]. The cells were seeded in plates
coated with 25 μg/mL poly-L-lysine (Sigma P-8638) and
cultured at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO2
using neurobasal media (Invitrogen cat. 21203-049) supplemented with 2 % B27 (Invitrogen cat.17504-044) and
0.5 mM L-Glutamine. Neurons harvested at J0 correspond
to cells lysed 4 hours after plating.
Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RTPCR)
Total RNA was extracted from rat and mice tissues or neuronal cultures with RNA NOW (Biogentex, Inc, cat. BX102) as recommended by the manufacturer. Total RNA
from adult and fetal human brains were purchased from
BD Biosciences. One microgram of total RNA was reverse
transcribed in 20 μl final volume, using oligo(dT) and the
ImProm-II Reverse Transcription System (Promega). PCRs
were performed in 25 μl with the Multiplex PCR kit (QIAGEN), including 0.5 to 1.5 μl cDNA (depending of the
experiment) and 0.8 μM of the appropriate primers. PCR
amplifications consist in an initial denaturation step

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/198

(95°C for 15 min) followed by 30, 35 or 40 cycles of
amplification (94°C, 30 sec; 58°C, 1.30 min and 72°C,
1.30 min) and a final extension of 10 min. PCR products
were analyzed on 2–4% agarose gel in 0.5× TAE buffer.
Single fragment PCR products were directly purified using
the QIAquick PCR purification kit and sequenced. In case
of simultaneous amplification of several fragments, each
fragment was excised from agarose gel, recovered using
the QIAEX II gel extraction kit and sequenced. The cDNAs
were first used to amplify GAPDH transcripts before investigating the expression of FAK transcripts.
The total level of FAK transcripts (independently of the
inclusion/exclusion of exons 13, 14 and 16) was examined using forward and reverse primers located in exons 7
and 9 respectively. To examine the global pattern of FAK
transcripts with distinct combinations of alternative exons
13, 14 and 16 (corresponding to boxes 28, 6 and 7), RTPCR were performed with primers flanking this region
(forward primer in exon 12 and reverse primer at the
exons 18–19 boundary). Improved detection of alternative transcripts expressed at low levels can be achieved by
using primers spanning each of the expected exonic junction [95]. A set of 4 forward primers were designed including the last 12 nt located at the 3' end of the upstream
exon and the first 12 nt of the following exon, (except for
H-F5 and R-F5, 25 mers). These 4 forward primers were
individually coupled with the unique reverse primer (see
above) (Figure 6A). Each pair of primers allows the specific detection of two FAK transcripts, differing by the
presence or absence of exon 16. A total of 8 alternative
transcripts may be expected (see Figure 6). FAK primers
specific for human, rat and mouse species were designed
according to the sequence reported for each species
(Accession numbers NCBI Gene ID:5747, NCBI Gene ID:
25614, NCBI Gene ID:14083). The expression of other
putative alternative human FAK transcripts was also examined (see Table 1): [RefSeq:NM_005607, GenBank:
BC028733, GenBank: L05186, GenBank: BC035404]. All
primers sequences are reported in additional file 8.
Quantification of PCR products was done by scanning
pictures of agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide
and measurement of relative optical density (Scion image
program, Scion Corporation). The values obtained for
FAK variants were normalized to GAPDH and expressed
as percentage of the maximal value.

Stacked-pairwise conservations profile of human, mouse and chicken
FRNK promoters and identification of transcription factor binding
sites. The promoter of chicken and mouse FRNK has been localized in the
intron between exon 22 and exon 23. To identify the human FRNK promoter we aligned independently the sequences of this intron in both species
with the corresponding human intron using the Mulan program. The conservation profile shown here focuses on the intronic 7 Kb sequence 5' to
exon 23 since no conserved region were observed upstream in the intron.
The +1 nucleotide corresponds to the mouse transcription initiation site
previously reported [48] and located approximatively 1 Kb from the translation start codon of FRNK. Three evolutionary conserved regions, ECR1,
ECR2 and ECR3 (underlined with brown lines), longer than 100 bp and
sharing more than 70% similarity overall were identified. ECR1 and
ECR2 correspond to the previously reported 5'-leader exon of FRNK in
chicken [37] and to an enhancer region of the mouse FRNK promoter
[48] respectively. We identified a new conserved sequence, ECR3, which
could contain regulatory information for FRNK expression. The MultiTF
tool (threshold = 0.95) was used to predict conserved transcription factor
binding sites (TFBS). Closed rectangles and open rectangles denotes previously reported and novel putative TFBS, respectively [48].

Pairwise conservation profile of human and mouse FAK promoters
and identification of transcription factor binding sites. Alignment of
the 5' sequence of the mouse FAK gene with the human FAK promoter
[GenBank: AY323812]. The multiple-sequence local alignment tool
Mulan [96] was used to obtain a pairwise conservation profile of the
human and putative mouse promoter. Dashed blue line indicates the minimal human FAK promoter, and the +1 nucleotide corresponds to the
human transcription initiation site located approximatively 110 Kb from
the start codon of the human FAK gene [47] (see Fig. 3). Short dark lines
indicate the length and similarity (mouse versus human) of individual
blocks of nucleotides across the identified conserved region. Two evolutionary conserved regions, ECR1 and ECR2 (underlined with brown lines),
longer than 100 bp and sharing more than 70% similarity overall were
identified. Red histograms indicate the percentage of similarity of individual blocks of nucleotide within ECR1 and ECR2. The MultiTF tool
(threshold = 0.95) was used to predict conserved transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) between the mouse and human promoters. The identified
TFBS (rectangles) are mainly localized in ECR1 and ECR2. Most TFBS
previously predicted in the human promoter [47] were found to be conserved in mouse (closed rectangles). Novel putative conserved TFBS identified in this study are indicated with open rectangles.

Introns and exons of the mouse and human FAK genes: length and
similarity. Data are based on the analysis of mouse and human sequences
of Ptk2 gene (NCBI Gene ID:5747).
