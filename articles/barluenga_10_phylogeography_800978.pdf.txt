Phylogeography, colonization and population
history of the Midas cichlid species complex
(Amphilophus spp.) in the Nicaraguan crater lakes
Marta Barluenga1,2, Axel Meyer1*

Abstract
Background: Elucidation of the mechanisms driving speciation requires detailed knowledge about the
phylogenetic relationships and phylogeography of the incipient species within their entire ranges as well as their
colonization history. The Midas cichlid species complex Amphilophus spp. has been proven to be a powerful model
system for the study of ecological specialization, sexual selection and the mechanisms of sympatric speciation.
Here we present a comprehensive and integrative phylogeographic analysis of the complete Midas Cichlid species
complex in Nicaragua (> 2000 individuals) covering the entire distributional range, using two types of molecular
markers (the mitochondrial DNA control region and 15 microsatellites). We investigated the majority of known lake
populations of this species complex and reconstructed their colonization history in order to distinguish between
alternative speciation scenarios.
Results: We found that the large lakes contain older and more diverse Midas Cichlid populations, while all crater
lakes hold younger and genetically less variable species assemblages. The large lakes appear to have repeatedly
acted as source populations for all crater lakes, and our data indicate that faunal exchange among crater lakes is
extremely unlikely. Despite their very recent (often only a few thousand years old) and common origin from the
two large Nicaraguan lakes, all crater lake Midas Cichlid radiations underwent independent, but parallel, evolution,
and comprise distinct genetic units. Indeed several of these crater lakes contain multiple genetically distinct
incipient species that most likely arose through sympatric speciation. Several crater lake radiations can be traced
back to a single ancestral line, but some appear to have more than one founding lineage. The timing of the
colonization(s) of each crater lake differs, although most of them occurred more (probably much more) recently
than 20,000 years ago.
Conclusion: The genetic differentiation of the crater lake populations is directly related to the number of founding
lineages, but independent of the timing of colonization. Interestingly, levels of phenotypic differentiation, and
speciation events, appeared independent of both factors.

Background
Since the application of molecular techniques gained
widespread acceptance among evolutionary biologists it
became possible to elucidate the mechanisms that are
responsible for the emergence of novel species with more
rigor than before [1-5]. Despite considerable advances in
the field, a hotly debated question remains whether speciation always requires geographic separation or instead

can evolve in spite of gene flow [4,6-12]. Recent studies
conclude that although allopatric speciation predominates (e.g., [4]), speciation with gene flow (sympatric and
parapatric) is theoretically plausible (for review see e.g.
[9]). Albeit still low, the number of empirical studies
strongly supporting a scenario of sympatric and parapatric speciation is growing [9,11,13-23]. This has shifted
the debate away from “if” and towards “how” and “how
often” speciation with gene flow occurs in nature, and
what the ecological and genetic conditions are under
which sympatric and parapatric speciation are most likely
to occur [9,24].

The study of biogeography and phylogeography can
provide baseline information on the question as to
whether speciation requires complete geographic isolation or not, by revealing contemporary and historical
gene flow among populations and incipient species [25].
One problem of speciation research is that biological,
ecological and biogeographic conditions at the time of
the origination of species may have changed over time,
and possibly be different today. Hence, the biotic conditions and geographic circumstances that might have
influenced speciation mechanisms and events might
often be obscured by subsequent evolutionary events
[4,9,26]. For example, species that evolved in allopatry
might become sympatric in their distribution subsequent
to their origin (e.g., [27]). One approach towards a better
understanding of speciation is to study incipient species,
lineages that are in the process of splitting [4]. In order
to make inferences about the mode, speed and biogeographic correlates or causes of any given speciation
event, it is mandatory to accumulate knowledge about
the phylogeography and evolutionary history of the
involved species and populations [26,28,29]. However,
speciation studies are rarely combined with comprehensive phylogeographic knowledge.
Cichlids (Family Cichlidae) are tropical freshwater
fishes occurring in southern and Central America,
Africa, Madagascar and India. They are one of the best
models for the study of biological diversification, since
this family of fish comprises both the fastest rates of
evolution (e.g., [14,30-36]) and the most diverse adaptive
radiations known [33,37-43]. The East African Great
Lakes Victoria, Malawi and Tanganyika - the hotspots of
their biodiversity - alone contain more than 1,500 endemic species [40,41,44,45], and have therefore been the
focus of numerous studies. It has repeatedly been questioned whether the hundreds of endemic species in each
of the East African lakes arose through ecological speciation in allopatric settings alone, or whether it is
necessary to invoke somewhat less traditional mechanisms of speciation to explain the origin of the cichlids’
unique diversity, such as sexual selection, or microallopatric, parapatric, or even sympatric diversification
[38,41,46-48]. The elucidation of the mechanisms of
speciation in East African cichlid assemblages is complicated by the huge dimensions of the lakes and their
cichlid fish radiations, their habitat diversity and the difficulty in reconstructing species relationships, particularly among the extremely young species of lakes
Victoria and Malawi [30-32,49].
Cichlids have also radiated albeit to a lesser extent in
smaller-scale lake environments. Two well-known examples of such radiations are the Cameroonian [18] and
the Nicaraguan [14,50] crater lake cichlids. These settings provide better grounds for testing alternative

Page 2 of 20

speciation modes, due to the general lack of barriers to
gene flow. Evidence for sympatric speciation has repeatedly been described in these crater lake cichlid systems
[14,18,19]. In this study we aim to provide a comprehensive phylogeographic context to the Nicaraguan case
studies of sympatric speciation [14,51-54]. This very
young cichlid radiation has already contributed towards
a deeper understanding of the evolutionary processes
generating cichlid diversification and is likely to do so in
future studies. In order to be able to rule out alternative
speciation hypotheses in the future, we provide here
comprehensive knowledge about its population history
and the phylogeographic circumstances under which
repeated sympatric speciation occurred.
Species of the Amphilophus radiation exist in an
group of crater lakes that are located on the western
part of Nicaragua in Central America right on the Pacific Ring of Fire, as well as in the Large Nicaraguan
Lakes, Managua and Nicaragua [55-57]; Figure 1; Table
1). Fish from this group are also found in tributaries
around the lakes and some rivers in Costa Rica where
they are considered rare [57,58]. Initially only two species were described for the species complex, a generalist
high bodied form widespread in the area (Cichlasoma
citrinellum - now Amphilophus citrinellus), and a specialist thick-lipped form restricted to the large lakes
Managua and Nicaragua (C. labiatum, now A. labiatus,
[59,60]). A third species endemic to the crater Lake
Apoyo was described more than one hundred years
later, in 1976 (C. zaliosum, now A. zaliosus [56]). Several more species have since been very recently
described in this polymorphic and polychromatic complex in the more thoroughly studied crater lakes Xiloá
and Apoyo [14,50,52,56,61,62]. However, the taxonomy
of this species complex will still need to be worked out
in full, by combining ecological, morphological and
genetic data also from populations of the less wellstudied crater lakes. But, it seems save to say that several more species await description - depending on
one’s view on species. As Seth Meek already remarked
in 1907 [63] about C. citrinellus “of all the species in
these lakes, this one is by far the most variable. I made
repeated efforts to divide this material listed below in
from two a half-dozen or more species, but in all cases
I was unable to find any tangible constant character to
define them. To regard them as more than one species
meant only to limit the number by the material at
hand, and so I have lumped them all in one.” Later that
page (p. 123) he goes on: “It is possible that more than
one species should be recognized here, and no doubt
such will some day be the case, especially if some
enthusiastic student of fishes has at his command far
less amount of material than I have had the opportunity
to examine.”

Figure 1 Map of the Pacific coast of Nicaragua and Costa Rica. Labeled localities correspond to sampling sites. Fish were collected from
several sites in the large Nicaraguan lakes (Managua, Nicaragua), and from several volcanic crater lakes (Asososca León, Apoyeque, Xiloá,
Asososca Managua, Masaya, Apoyo), Tisma Pond, Las Canoas reservoir, and the rivers Tipitapa, Malacatoya and San Juan.

The Midas cichlid species complex, as a consequence
of its extensive variation in color and morphology, and
its particular geographic distribution, is an especially
interesting model system for the study of the mechanisms and the underlying biogeographic settings of speciation. To be able to distinguish between alternative

evolutionary scenarios - e.g., whether particular body
plans or trophic strategies evolved only once or multiple
times, or whether given lineages are the consequence of
single or repeated colonization events within confined
water bodies - it is compulsory to have detailed knowledge of the phylogeography, population history and

colonization history of the species complex throughout
its range (see [64,65]). To this end we first aimed to collect the entire diversity of phenotypic forms and species
present in each water body and then investigated the
phylogeographic patterns of the entire Midas cichlid
complex in Nicaragua, focusing on the populations from
the crater lakes, several of which are likely to have been
and still are undergoing in situ diversification. We also
collected data on the populations from the large lakes,
the most likely source population of the newly formed
and much younger volcanic calderas, including data
from surrounding rivers.
Previous studies have partially reconstructed the phylogeography of the Midas Cichlid species complex in
some of the lakes mostly based on mitochondrial DNA
sequences [52,66,67] Geiger et al. [67] have just published a phylogeographic study of this species complex
based on AFLP markers on a sample of ca. 100 fish
from 9 water bodies, covering the majority of the area
of distribution. Here, using over 2000 fish samples and
two types of molecular markers (the complete sequence
of the mitochondrial control region and 15 microsatellites) we reconstruct the phylogeography of the entire
Midas cichlid complex. We first describe the phenotypic
diversity encountered in each lake. We assign individuals to populations based on nuclear genetic data to
test for the genetic cohesiveness of each lake/crater lake
population. We then focus on the Large Nicaraguan
lakes, which represent the source populations, because
they contain the largest, oldest and most stable populations, and investigate the genetic diversity and structure
of their species and populations. Following this, we
investigate the age and colonization history of each crater lake, and estimate the timing, source and size of the
colonization events. We discuss the relative importance
of the colonizing population size versus the timing of
colonization, and relate it to present levels of intralacustrine phenotypic differentiation. We also discuss the
apparent disconnection found between current genetic
and phenotypic diversity within lakes. Later we will discuss how our results compare with those of the study
by Geiger et al. [67]. We finally test the hypothesis that
isolated water bodies have undergone independent evolution, regardless of their very young history and their
degree of phenotypic differentiation.

Results
Samples and Phenotypic diversity

The number of samples obtained in each of the studied
water bodies differed which was by differences in accessibility and abundance. Localities from which we were
able to collect less that 15 samples where not used for
population genetic approaches. We found diverse body
plans and color types in all studied lakes. In the large

Page 4 of 20

lakes we found high-bodied A. citrinellus with cryptic
dark normal and conspicuous gold coloration (see [52])
in all sampled sites (< 15 samples in Mateare and
Momotombo). We also collected thick-lipped A. labiatus individuals from both large lakes, with both normal
and gold colorations, always associated with rocky habitats. Within Lake Managua A. labiatus was found only
in two localities Miraflores (< 15 samples) and Momotombo. In Lake Nicaragua A. labiatus was observed at
all sampled localities (but >15 samples were only collected in Isletas in Granada where this species was
highly abundant). In Tisma we found both normal and
gold A. citrinellus. In crater lakes Asososca Managua
and Asososca Leon we found mostly high-bodied A.
citrinellus forms, but also a few elongated individuals (<
15 per lake; all with normal coloration in the former
lake and all normal but one gold in the latter, see Additional file 1, Table S1). In crater Lake Apoyeque all fish
had normal coloration and most fish were high-bodied
A. citrinellus type, but a few individuals had thick lips (<
15). In crater Lake Xiloá we found two types of highbodied individuals, one with yellowish coloration breeding at smaller sizes and living in shallower habitats, and
another type with both normal coloration (most abundant) and gold coloration individuals, which breed at
bigger sizes and inhabit deeper habitats. We also found
an elongated form living in the open water with both
normal and gold coloration. These three forms have
been described as new species (Amphilophus amarillo,
A. xiloaensis and A. sagittae respectively; [61]). A thicklipped form has also been seen in this lake [50], but
although we have observed them while diving we collected no representatives. In crater Lake Masaya we
found mostly high-bodied normal A. citrinelus fish, but
also gold, and thick-lipped individuals (for both <15). In
crater Lake Apoyo, similarly to Xiloá, we found two
types of high-bodied fish, one breeding at smaller sizes
and living in shallower habitats, and another breeding at
bigger sizes and inhabiting deeper habitats. These two
morphs have been described as new species (A. astorquii
and A. chancho respectively [62]); we also collected an
elongated form living in the open water - A. zaliosus.
Another species has been described in this lake (A. flaveolus) similar to the small high-bodied form but with
yellowish coloration. We collected a few individuals that
responded to this description (Lorenzo J. Lopez Pérez
pers. com.) (< 15). A detailed list of all specimens
included in this study, voucher identifications and
their sampling localities is provided in Additional file 1,
Table S1.
Descriptive statistics and genetic diversity

The 15 microsatellite loci analyzed (Additional file 1,
Table S2) contained high levels of polymorphism. The

Barluenga and Meyer BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:326

number of alleles per locus ranged between 3 (Acit 6)
and 41 (BurtKit), and the number of alleles per lake and
species ranged between 64 (crater Lake Apoyeque) and
246 (A. citrinellus, Lake Nicaragua). Details on descriptive statistics and genetic diversity indexes averaged
across loci are shown in Table 2. The highest genetic
diversity measured as both gene diversity (Hs) and allelic richness was found in the populations from Lake
Nicaragua (both A. citrinellus and A. labiatus) followed
by the populations in Lake Managua and Tisma Pond.
Genetic diversity was significantly higher in the large
lakes and Tisma Pond than in the crater lakes (Hs,
0.754 vs. 0.596, P = 0.012; allelic richness, 11.219 vs.
6.708, P = 0.002). There was no evidence for systematic
scoring errors according to MICRO-CHECKER. Linkage
disequilibrium between pairs of loci was non-significant
for every comparison. Genotype distributions were generally in accordance with expected Hardy-Weinberg
proportions, and only 19 out of 180 population-locus
combinations showed significant deviations, but did not
consistently involve the same loci.
Clustering analyses and population genetic differentiation

We estimated the number of genetically distinct populations contained in our Midas Cichlid species group by
applying a Bayesian model-based clustering algorithm,
assuming a fixed number of populations as implemented
in STRUCTURE[68]. This analysis revealed that all individuals within water bodies formed genetically

homogeneous groups based on multilocus nuclear markers (Figure 2). Importantly, all different species and
morphotypes within the large and crater lakes were
genetically more similar to other species or morphs
within the same lake than to phenotypically similar
forms in other water bodies. It is important to note that
thick-lipped forms from the crater lakes (Apoyeque,
Masaya and Xiloá) were genetically indistinguishable
from the other fish within those lakes. The best log-likelihood probability was found associated with k = 7 (see
a plot with all the log-likelihood probabilities in Additional file 2, Figure S1a). To further evaluate this result
we applied a clustering algorithm assuming a variable
number of populations as implemented in STRUCTURAMA. This analysis found that the most likely number
of populations was 4 (Additional file 2, Table S3a). We
plotted clustering groups from k = 2-8 in Figure 2. Each
step from k = 2 to k = 8 gradually differentiated better
and better among the different lakes in the following
sequence: k = 2, the three species in crater Lake Apoyo,
which formed a genetically homogeneous cluster, from
the rest; k = 3, crater Lake Apoyo, crater Lake Apoyeque together with the three species in crater Lake Xiloá,
from the rest; k = 4, crater Lake Apoyo, crater Lake
Apoyeque, all three species in crater Lake Xiloá, from
the rest; k = 5, crater Lake Apoyo, crater Lake Apoyeque, crater Lake Xiloá, crater Lake Masaya, from the
rest; k = 6, crater Lake Apoyo, crater Lake Apoyeque,
crater Lake Xiloá, crater Lake Masaya, crater Lake

and found no differentiation between the two species, A.
citrinellus and A. labiatus within any of the two lakes.
STRUCTURE revealed k = 2 (Additional file 2, Figure
S1b) separating all fish within each of the two large
lakes (Tisma Pond clustering together with the fish
from Lake Managua), and STRUCTURAMA confirmed
two genetically distinct populations (Additional file 2,
Table S3b, see also k = 2 in Additional file 2, Figure S2).

We also performed a series of principal correspondence analyses (PCoA) to investigate the relative position of each lake population within a multidimensional
space (Figure 3). The result of this analysis was largely
congruent with the clustering of STRUCTURE. We first
included all populations, and the first principal coordinate axis (Figure 3a; PCoA1 = 44.71%, FST = 0.071, P =
0.01) clearly differentiated the species in crater Lake
Apoyo from all other populations, as did the previous
clustering method. PCoA2 (16.54%, F ST = 0.025, P =
0.12) separated, although not significantly, the species
within crater Lake Apoyo, and populations in crater
lakes Apoyeque and Asososca León from the rest (Figure 3a). The second analysis (Figure 3b) was performed
without the samples from crater Lake Apoyo, and differentiated the populations from crater lakes Apoyeque
and Asososca León from the other populations along
PCoA1 (27.49%, F ST = 0.033, P = 0.001). PCoA2

(20.39%, F ST = 0.023, P = 0.001) separated these two
populations. Hence, the third analysis (Figure 3c) was
performed without samples from the crater lakes Apoyo,
Apoyeque and Asososca León. This analysis PCoA1
(24.67%, F ST = 0.021, P = 0.001) distinguished most
clearly the species in crater Lake Xiloá (which showed
some overlap with individuals from Lake anagua) and
crater Lake Masaya (which showed some overlap with
Lake Nicaragua) from the rest, and less clearly the samples from crater Lake Asososca Managua. PCoA2
(19.65%, FST = 0.016, P = 0.001) separated crater lakes
Xiloá and Masaya from crater Lake Asososca Managua.
The last analysis included only the samples from the
two large lakes in Nicaragua (both A. citrinellus and A.
labiatus) and Tisma Pond. PCoA1 (24.04%, FST = 0.014,
P = 0.001) discriminated between the two lakes but
revealed some degree of overlap, and clumped the samples from Tisma Pond together with those of Lake Managua (PCoA2 = 19.03%, F ST = 0.005, P = 1.00; Figure

3d). As in the previous clustering analysis, within the
two large lakes the two species A. citrinellus and A.
labiatus were not clearly differentiated.
F-statistics revealed that populations of the Midas
Cichlid species complex from all lakes were generally
significantly differentiated from each other with both
types of molecular markers (average mtDNA F ST =
0.23; microsatellites F ST = 0.16). The few exceptions
from this general finding involved the fish from the
large lakes, fish from Tisma Pond and fish from the
River San Juan (see Table 3, Additional file 2, Table
S4). Fish from Tisma Pond cannot be genetically distinguished from A. citrinellus in Lake Managua, to
which it is temporarily connected. Fish from the River
San Juan cannot be distinguished from A. citrinellus in
Lake Nicaragua, to which is permanently connected.
Interestingly, fish from Las Canoas, a water body geographically connected to Lake Nicaragua but today
separated by a dam, were genetically clearly

file 2, Table S4); no single mtDNA haplotype was
shared between Las Canoas and fish in any other water
body. All identified species within crater lakes are
genetically differentiated from each other supporting
their taxonomic assignment as different species (Table
3). Geographically distant populations within the large
lakes showed some degree of genetic differentiation as
well. Within Lake Managua, populations of A. citrinellus collected from different sites (Figure 1, names in
white) were genetically indistinguishable, but A. labiatus collected in Momotombo were consistently genetically differentiated from A. citrinellus from all other
localities with both types of molecular markers (see
Additional file 2, Table S4a). Within Lake Nicaragua,
geographically distant populations of both A. citrinellus
and A. labiatus were not consistently differentiated,
although some pairwise comparisons clearly differed
(Additional file 2, Table S4b). The comparison of the
two species in the best-sampled population, the Isletas,
revealed significant differences.

Phylogenetic reconstruction and demographic analyses

Among the 2173 fish included in this study we found
512 different mitochondrial haplotypes. MtDNA haplotypes differed from each other by an average of 3.5 and
a maximum of 17 mutations. The number of haplotypes,
proportion of private alleles, maximum number of
mutations and nucleotide diversity found in each lake is
shown in Table 2. A haplotype network of all unique
mtDNA sequences had a star-like structure, with a central most abundant haplotype (haplotype C) found in
almost all populations and localities in the central position. Due to the difficulties in depicting such large number of haplotypes, only the networks for each of the six
crater lakes we investigated are shown (Figure 4), and
since all species within crater lakes clustered together in
the Bayesian assignment test using nuclear markers, in
this analyses they were depicted with a single crater lake
color. Only two crater lakes, Apoyo (including all
described species) and Asososca León do not contain
individuals with the most common mtDNA haplotype
‘C’. The samples from the large lakes Nicaragua and

Managua (including both species A. citrinellus and A.
labiatus) and Tisma Pond, contained the largest amount
of genetic diversity with the largest maximum distance
between haplotypes (see Table 2). These lakes shared
many haplotypes, but they had also many private ones.
Crater Lake Apoyeque contained the smallest mtDNA
diversity with only three private haplotypes found that
were separated each only by single mutations, with
almost all of the 90 Apoyeque individuals investigated
here sharing the central haplotype C (note that within a
much smaller sample size, only 15 individuals, Geiger
et al. [67] only found the central haplotyope C and
none of the private mtDNA haplotypes). Crater lakes
Masaya and Xiloa both had a large number of different
haplotypes, several private and several shared with both
large lakes. Crater Lake Asososca Managua shared the
haplotype C, and one more haplotype (54) with two
samples from Lake Managua and Tisma respectively.

Page 10 of 20

Crater lakes Asososca Leon and Apoyo did not share
any haplotype with any other locality and are the only
two crater lakes discovered to be monophyletic as
shown by mtDNA. Detailed information about the
mtDNA haplotype of each individual used is shown in
Additional file 1, TableS1.
A mismatch analysis was performed to compare the
demographic history of the Midas Cichlid lineages in
the different lakes of Nicaragua (Figure 5); the associated parameters are summarized in Table 4. All populations but those of A. citrinellus from the large Lake
Nicaragua and fish in crater Lake Apoyo followed a
model of sudden expansion. The oldest expansions with
the largest mismatch values (mismatch mean values > 4)
were detected in the two large lakes. We found signatures of extremely recent expansions in crater Lake
Apoyeque (mismatch mean value < 1). Significant Tajima’s D with very negative values were found for all

Discussion
The Midas Cichlid species complex has gained notoriety
as a textbook example for rapid phenotypic diversity,
explosive rates of speciation and as an example for speciation in sympatry. It is well recognized as being phenotypically highly polymorphic despite its very young age
[35,52,56,57,63,69,70]. Based on this phenotypic diversity
several incipient species have been described [50,61,62].
Our comprehensive phylogeographic approach finds it to
be genetically diverse as well, with levels of overall diversity comparable to that of the hundreds of cichlid species
inhabiting the Lake Victoria region in East Africa [31,32].
All Nicaraguan lakes differed in their levels of genetic
diversity. Populations in the vast and old Nicaraguan
large lakes were as expected genetically most diverse
(Table 2; Figure 5). They contain the oldest, and most
diverse fauna (Table 1). Crater lake populations were
typically genetically much less diverse (Figure 5, Table 2)
and certainly much younger. The crater lake populations
differed considerably from each other just as the crater
lakes vary in size, age and degree of isolation (Table 1).
Remarkably, in spite of being genetically rather depauperate (crater Lake Apoyeque is the extreme case where
only three different mtDNA haplotypes were found), the
Midas cichlids in some crater lakes are phenotypically
diverse, and even contain novel phenotypes, which in
several cases are genetically differentiated (Table 3) and
most likely constitute endemic incipient species. There
was no obvious relationship between the number of
morphs or species described for a particular crater lake,
and its genetic diversity. Fish from the two large lakes

appear to have repeatedly acted as source populations of
the newly formed and much younger volcanic calderas.
Lake Managua most likely seeded the northern crater
lakes, being physically connected in the past to some of
them (e.g. Lake Xiloá), and L. Nicaragua the southern
ones, as suggested by levels of genetic similarity, relative
position in the multilocus multidimensional space (Figure
3), and geographical proximity. Most interestingly,
despite their recent and common origin, all crater lake
Midas Cichlid populations underwent independent evolution and have unique genetic signatures (Figure 2). All
Nicaraguan lakes are genetically differentiated from each
other, and all different morphs or incipient species
described within each lake are genetically more similar to
each other than to any other fish in any other lake. Some
remarkable similar phenotypes are found across some of
the crate lake species assemblages that most likely arose
independently in parallel.
The Large Nicaraguan lakes: the source populations

The large Nicaraguan lakes, Managua and Nicaragua
contain the most genetically diverse Midas Cichlid
populations, which have experienced the oldest demographic expansions 3-4 mutations ago (Figure 5; Table
2; Table 4). Previous estimations date the earliest expansion of Midas cichlids in the Nicaraguan lakes ca.
100,000 years ago [52] Geological data confirm that the
basin of the large Nicaraguan lakes originated less than
1 Mya [70,71], and fish are estimated to first have colonized the area only about 500,000 years ago [70].
Despite the relatively shallowness of the area, demographic analyses show that the large Nicaraguan lakes
probably remained a relatively stable environment for
fish populations over time, owing to their large dimensions and relatively homogeneous environment. The
large Nicaraguan lakes are the most likely historical
source of the Midas Cichlid species complex. The

Barluenga and Meyer BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:326
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/326

members of this species complex are rare in rivers,
although its closest relatives (A. hogaboomorus, A. centrarchus or A. trimaculatus [72]) are riverine species, as
probably was their ancestor. The Midas Cichlid ancestor
must have adapted early to the lacustrine environment
where the species is now most abundant.
Historically, the two large Nicaraguan lakes formed a
single water body that separated in the late Pleistocene
[55,73]. Today they remain connected via the River Tipitapa, partially subterranean, but with periodical water
exchange. Accordingly, the fish from the two large lakes
are genetically relatively similar (Figure 2, Figure 3),
although significant population differentiation between
them does exist (Figure 2, Table 3). The permanent
pond on the connecting river, Tisma, contains a fish
population genetically indistinguishable from those from
Lake Managua, at the inflow of the river, but they are
genetically differentiated from the fish close to the outflow into Lake Nicaragua (Table 3, Additional file 2, Figure S2). Therefore, the contemporary exchange of fish
between these lakes appears not to be very extensive.
Lake Nicaragua drains in the south into River San Juan.
Accordingly, A. citrinellus from the upper Rio San Juan
are genetically indistinguishable from those in the lake
(Additional file 2, Table 4). The River Malacatoya drains
into the North of Lake Nicaragua, but the fish from the
reservoir in this river (Las Canoas) are genetically markedly differentiated from A. citrinellus in Lake Nicaragua,
as well as in any other water body, indicating absence of
contemporary fish exchange (Table 3).
Allopatric differentiation

The sheer size of the large Nicaraguan lakes, they are
the largest in Central America, might favor the divergence of geographically distant populations within lakes.
Cichlid species widespread in the large African lakes
often show allopatric diversification, even forming allopatric local species in some instances (see review in
[43]). In both large Nicaraguan lakes, populations of A.
citrinellus separated by several kilometers showed some
genetic differentiation, but this result was not consistently supported by the different molecular markers
employed (Additional file 2, Table S4). Thus, the genetic
differentiation of allopatric populations of A. citrinellus
within the large lakes is not very pronounced in our
sample, possibly because of large effective population
sizes and the persistence of shared ancestral polymorphisms. However, relatively high levels of recent gene flow
among populations within this lake could also explain
this finding, since no barrier to gene flow other than
distance exists. Similarly, phenotypic differences among
allopatric populations are not pronounced (unpubl.
data), probably due to habitat similarity and local adaptations to similar environmental conditions. Some hidden diversity (both genetic and phenotypic) could still

Page 12 of 20

remain undiscovered due to the relative turbidity of the
large lakes, although this possibility seems unlikely
because of the extensive work in the area over the years.
Sympatric differentiation

Two species of the Midas Cichlid complex co-occur in
sympatry in the large Nicaraguan lakes, the widespread
and common A. citrinellus, and the seemingly more specialized and only locally abundant thick-lipped species
A. labiatus. These two species are morphologically quite
distinct, which suggests that they also are ecologically
segregated, although ecological studies are still lacking.
Amphilophus labiatus have very characteristic fleshy lips
[56], a character also common in other African cichlid
species [39], and more elongated snout [74], traits interpreted as adaptations for feeding on invertebrates and
crustaceans between crannies, sealing the substrate and
sucking the food items [56,75]. The elongated snout is
suggested to be an additional adaptation for increasing
the power of suction [74]. In agreement with this
hypothesized foraging behavior, we found A. labiatus, as
other fleshy-lipped cichlids, linked to the presence of
rocky habitats-which is also reflected in our sample collection, while A. citrinellus was mostly found on sandy
substrates in the large lakes [76].
Amphilophus labiatus was collected from several sites
in Lake Nicaragua, and populations across the lake
showed some allopatric differentiation. Sympatric populations of the two species showed genetic differentiation,
but the Bayesian assignment tests did not discriminate
between them (Additional file 2, Figure S2). In Lake
Managua A. labiatus is less abundant, since there are
also fewer rocks, and we did not find it to be coexisting
in sympatry with A. citrinellus. For this study only one
sampling site provided sufficient samples (Momotombo),
and A. labiatus from this site was consistently genetically significantly different from all A. citrinellus populations. However, since no sympatric sample of A.
citrinellus from this site could be collected, it is not possible to distinguish between species segregation due to
ecological adaptation or allopatric differentiation.
In summary, although thick-lipped species are common in cichlid radiations, and A. citrinellus and A.
labiatus are morphologically and ecologically clearly differentiated, they remain genetically surprisingly indistinguishable (Additional file 2, Figure S2). This is possibly
due to the persistence of ancestral shared polymorphisms. Pronounced phenotypic plasticity can be ruled out
since in sympatric settings genetic differences are often
found and lips persist also in the laboratory, when fish
are feed on the same diets (A.M. pers. obs.). Also in the
laboratory thick-lipped fish prefer to mate with thicklipped fish over fish with small lips (A.M. pers. obs.)
further supporting their status as two described species.
It would appear that the morphological innovation of

Barluenga and Meyer BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:326
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/326

fleshy lips evolved very rapidly and multiple times independently in different geographic locations. This idea is
supported by the presence of thick-lipped forms in
some of the Nicaraguan crater lakes (such as Masaya,
Xiloá and Apoyeque - although in low frequencies
and genetically undifferentiated from other forms within
those lakes) and in other cichlid radiations in the
African lakes. Future research on additional morphological characters such as body shape, trophic structures or
coloration and genetic differentiation might lead to
future descriptions of several thick-lipped species in
those crater lakes.
Colonization history of the crater lakes

An interesting result of this study is that despite the
recent origin of most crater lakes (< 20,000 years), the
Midas Cichlid populations in each of them had their
own characteristic genetic signature, clearly differentiated from any other population in the area (Figure 2),
as well as its own array of phenotypes and species
([50,74], Barluenga et al. unpubl.). This genetic distinction has also been found using AFLP data on a smaller
sample of Midas cichlids, corroborating the robustness
of this result [67]. Subsets of the same source populations from the large lakes seeded all crater lakes. Potential heterogeneity within the source populations due to
unconnected colonization events, coupled with the independent evolution occurring in each crater lake, have
resulted in very differentiated crater lake populations.
This is genetically reflected in the abundance of private
mtDNA haplotypes in each lake (Table 2), their unique
microsatellite allele composition (Figure 2; Figure 3)
and, ultimately, the evolution of endemic crater lake
species in some cases [14,50,51,56,62,77]. For example,
in crater Lake Xiloá also a new sardine and a new
shrimp species have been described [77]. In several crater lakes several new species that belong to the Midas
Cichlid species complex have been described more
recently [50,61,62], and we here report genetic differentiation among several of them.
The unique genetic signature of each crater lake
population appears to be influenced by the combination
of two main factors, the age of colonization (recent vs.
old), but also the number of founding lineages (single or
multiple colonizations, and/or founding populations
large or small). Other factors likely to influence genetic
composition are demographic events after colonization.
Timing of colonization

We inferred the time of colonization of the different crater
lakes from the estimates of major demographic expansions
they experienced within these areas (Figure 5). If there
were major demographic events after colonization (e.g.,
volcanic activity or newer colonizations) our estimations would correspond to establishment of the recent

Page 13 of 20

population rather than colonization per se. Older populations in the Midas Cichlid system are characterized
by higher numbers of private alleles and a distinct allelic composition, but not necessarily by pronounced
phenotypic differentiation. Younger populations are
typically genetically undifferentiated from the source
population, although in some cases contain novel morphotypes, that have not been described in the large
source lakes. Remarkably, we find a pronounced disconnection between genetic and phenotypic diversity.
According to the demographic analyses based on
mtDNA sequences, the oldest colonization was most
likely in crater Lake Asososca León, which expanded
within the lake about 3-4 mutations ago (Figure 5). It
is probably a relatively old lake, although its exact geological age is unknown. This lake contains a relatively
large number of unique mtDNA haplotypes (see also
[67]) separated by up to six mutations from any haplotype that is found in any of the other lakes (Figure 4).
Interestingly and in spite of a relatively old age and
diverse genetic signature, phenotypic diversity does not
appear to be pronounced. Although not comparatively
analyzed here, most individuals belonged to the typical
high-bodied morphotype, with only a few more elongated individuals. The estimates of population expansion of the Midas Cichlid species complexes of crater
lakes Masaya and Apoyo (each of them containing at
least three different incipient species; [14,62,78], pers.
obs.) are younger, about 1-2 mutations ago. This
would fit with the known age of Lake Apoyo, dated at
less than 20,000 years. A population expansion about
one mutation ago was detected for Lake Xiloá (with
three to five described species; [50]), which agrees with
the records of the last volcanic activity in the area
(INETER, http://www.ineter.gob.ni/). Population expansions occurring less than one mutation ago were consistently found in Asososca Managua (with mostly high
bodied A. citrinellus individuals, but several more elongated) and Apoyeque (two morphs described [78,79]),
lineages and lakes that could be just a few thousand of
years old. Clearly, in less, possibly even much less than
10,000 years [79], the species complexes in each of the
crater lakes in Nicaragua expanded and diversified to
the small-scale radiations that are now evident from
most of these isolated lakes.
Number of founding lineages

Genetic diversity values in some crater lakes strikingly
contrast their very recent origin (according to volcanic
activity reports, [80]; INETER, http://www.ineter.gob.ni/),
and young estimated demographic history. This is the
case for crater lakes Xiloá and Masaya (Table 2; Figure
4), which also have relatively high number of fish species
(Table 1). Some of this genetic variation possibly did not
evolve in situ in these lakes, due to the recency of their

Barluenga and Meyer BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:326
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/326

multiple colonization(s) (see also Figure 5). These two
lakes could have been temporarily connected to the large
lakes, when they would have acquired a large portion of
the source fauna’s genetic diversity (including diverse
Midas cichlids), which would also explain the extensive
faunal correspondence among these lakes crater lakes
and the large Nicaraguan lakes. No data about physical
connections exist for crater Lake Masaya, and geological
and geographic evidence make this possibility rather unlikely, leaving the presence of this diversity (including
polymorphic and polychromatic Midas cichlid species)
unresolved. Unfortunately, crater Lake Masaya is highly
polluted, since the city of Masaya dumps its waste and
waste water untreated into it, severely hampering detailed
study of its fauna due to health concerns. Geological
reports confirm that crater Lake Xiloá was originally connected to Lake Managua [81] supporting our interpretation of the origin of its genetic diversity. These two lakes
(Xiloá and Managua) separated when the water level
dropped as Lake Nicaragua began to drain into the
Atlantic Ocean through the San Juan river [77]. The fossil record also indicates that the original fauna of Lake
Xiloá was more diverse than it is nowadays [77]. It is
argued that the stringent physical conditions of this crater lake (very high concentration of salts in the water)
might have caused the disappearance of some species, as
well as the evolution of local endemism [77]. The high
levels of polymorphism in the Midas cichlids of this crater lake suggests that in situ diversification might have
taken place in the lake during its short history independent from Lake Managua [50]. This study demonstrate
all Midas cichlids from crater Lake Xiloá are genetically
more similar to each other than to any other fish in the
area (Figure 2; see also [51]).
Both crater lakes Asososca Managua and Apoyeque
have a signature typical of small and genetically homogeneous colonizations, since all mtDNA haplotypes are
connected to each other by single mutations, and the
amount of genetic diversity is muted. Alternatively,
those populations might have experienced a bottleneck
due to volcanic activity after colonization. The time
since their colonization is estimated to be particularly
short (especially crater Lake Apoyeque was probably
colonized in historic times; [79]) which is reflected in
very small overall distances between haplotypes. The age
of the present day populations in both lakes could be
much younger than 10,000 or in the case of Apoyeque
even only 1000 years. Geological data report the last
eruption of Volcano Apoyeque < 2,000 years ago
(INETER, http://www.ineter.gob.ni/; [82]). Periodic fish
kills are reported to occur still today for some of the
crater lakes due to remaining volcanic activity, and the
Apoyeque crater has even been reported to have been
active in historic times, less than 150 years ago.

Page 14 of 20

Remarkably, despite its very recent origin, the crater
Lake Apoyeque contains a polymorphic Midas Cichlid
population, with normal and thick-lipped forms [78,79],
The colonization of these two lakes could have been
caused by exceptional natural phenomena, such as a
hurricane or a tropical storm that could have resulted in
fish rains. However, it has been speculated that indigenous human populations might have stocked some of the
crater lakes with fishes as well [73]. It should be noted,
however, that the genetic signatures of the lakes argue
against this possibility (multiple human stockings at
least) since most of the crater lakes appear to be both
monophyletic and show unique population expansion
signals.
Crater Lake Apoyo also has a signature of a small and
genetically homogeneous colonization and no single
mtDNA haplotype is shared with any other lake (i.e., all
mtDNA haplotypes are private to the lake; Figure 4).
The genetic signature of the Midas Cichlid species complex that is endemic to Lake Apoyo is the most derived
as revealed by all genetic analyses (Table 3; Figure 2;
Figure 3), uncovering a very strong founder effect [7]
during the colonization, followed by a pronounced
expansion event, about two mutational steps ago. It has
already been shown that A. zaliosus, an endemic species
adapted to open water, originated in this lake and
evolved sympatrically with the ancestral Midas cichlid
population within the lake [14,56]. Here we show evidence of differentiation of up to three species within
this crater lake, all forming a genetically homogeneous
group (both with mitochondrial and nuclear markers).
This confirms the scenario of sympatric speciation
in situ in the lake, and make alternative evolutionary
scenarios (such as the proposed multiple colonizations
of the lake with introgression, or the origin of these species somewhere outside crater Lake Apoyo and secondary colonization [83]), far less parsimonious, implying a
series of very unlikely extinction events (see [84]).
Making inferences about the evolutionary processes
that have occurred in crater Lake Asososca León is rendered difficult since the colonization of this lake
occurred a relatively long time ago compared to the
other crater lakes. We show here, as we did previously
also for crater Lake Apoyo [14], that all mtDNA haplotypes are private (Figure 4). This strongly suggests that
the size of the colonizing population was very small, or,
alternatively, that a major extinction event, or even periods of smaller population size have occurred in its history that decimated all other haplotypes that might have
once existed in this crater lake. The latter explanation
seems rather unlikely since there is no reason to assume
that only the locally endemic mtDNA types should have
survived such a catastrophic event. Another alternative
possibility would be that the lake was colonized from a

Barluenga and Meyer BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:326
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/326

source other than the large lakes, e.g., a river, thus
explaining the lack of sharing of mtDNA haplotypes
with their populations. Samples of other fish species
from this lake would allow exploring this, albeit unlikely,
hypothesis. Although this lake has not been thoroughly
studied, no major morphological or genetic diversification among the Midas cichlids from there has been
detected, despite the presence of a few more elongated
individuals.
The combined effect of both timing and size of the
colonizing populations will influence the genetic composition of newly formed crater lake populations, together
with possible demographic events after colonization
linked to volcanic activity. Although the longer ago a
colonization event occurred, the more likely it is for
populations to have diversified in situ, we find the strongest genetic differentiation among species in lakes where
founder populations were small and genetically homogeneous, regardless of their age. Bottleneck effects most
strongly shape the genetic structure of crater lake populations at neutral loci. Interestingly, the evolution of
phenotypic differentiation does not seem to be related
to genetic diversity (at least as measured by neutral markers). Most likely, differences in ecological opportunity
(diversity of ecological niches, release of interspecific
competition and predation, etc.) among crater lakes
determine the degree of morphological, behavioral and
ecological diversity contained in each system. The validation of this hypothesis would require a more formal
description of all the phenotypic diversity as well as the
characterization of the ecological niches contained in
each lake, an effort that is still incomplete.
Origin of the colonization

The large lakes are the most likely source populations of
all crater lake Midas cichlids. The origin of the Midas
Cichlid in crater Lake Asososca León is difficult to
reconstruct since it shows no obvious genetic affinities
to any other studied population. Crater Lake Apoyeque
has a genetic composition that would be compatible
with several population sources, since the most common
haplotype within the lake is also the overall central one
(haplotype C); also the most common haplotype in the
majority of the other lakes, including the large lakes. Its
geographical position suggests that its fauna could have
its origin in Lake Managua. Crater Lake Xiloá could be
a potential source as well, and nuclear markers cluster
these populations together (k = 3 in Figure 2), although
the central haplotype ‘C’ is not as common among the
Midas cichlids from there. The fauna of crater Lake
Xiloá very likely had its origin in Lake Managua (suggested by the F-statistics and PCoA analyses; see also
[67]), just as that of crater Lake Asososca Managua
(which only shares haplotypes with fish from this lake,
apart from the haplotype C) (Figure 2, Figure 3; Table 3).

Page 15 of 20

Crater Lake Masaya shows higher similarity to Lake
Nicaragua (Figure 2), what is consistent with its closer
geographic proximity. The Midas cichlids from crater
Lake Apoyo are rather distinct from any other population, but pairwise genetic distances (Table 3) and geography suggest that it might have had its origin in Lake
Nicaragua, which is also supported by recent AFLP analyses [67].
Neutral genetic diversity and phenotypic variation

When populations colonize new environments adaptations to the novel conditions arise. The Midas Cichlid in
several lakes in Nicaragua has evolved new species
adapted to different ecological niches. Novel phenotypes
often appear by selection on new mutations. But this
process requires waiting for new mutations to be generated. Faster alternatives are the recruitment of beneficial
mutations from standing genetic variation [85], or even
reshuffling of standing variation by hybridization [86].
The evolution of the Midas Cichlid in the Nicaraguan
crater lakes has occurred in a relatively short period of
time [14,52]. New mutations are not likely to explain all
existing diversity. In addition, the repeated evolution of
equivalent species makes the ‘evolution of new mutations’ hypothesis rather unlikely. Therefore, it is likely
that standing genetic variation plays an important role
here. Some crater lakes have been colonized by multiple
lineages, perhaps at multiple times, which will likely
maintain high standing genetic diversity, and even make
possible re-shuffling of existing variation. However,
some crater lake populations have clearly been colonized
by severely bottlenecked lineages, which reduces the
expected retained variation. Interestingly, we do not find
reduced or slowed levels of adaptation and speciation in
these populations, as exemplified by the radiation in crater Lake Apoyo, or even in crater Lake Apoyeque. This
raises the very exciting question of how standing levels
of genetic variation affect the speed and diversity
attained by adaptive radiations. Preliminary transcriptome wide analyses on crater Lake Apoyo species, where
genetic diversity is relatively low, revealed weak functional genomic differences between the incipient species
[87], concordant with the young age of the radiation.
Similar analyses on genetically richer crater lakes could
provide information about the relative functional differentiation in relation to standing diversity.

Conclusion
The Midas Cichlid species complexes from the Nicaraguan lakes are genetically and phenotypically diverse.
Single lake flocks comprise in some cases homogeneous
and monophyletic lineages, while in some others more
diverse and polyphyletic genetic lineages possibly colonized by more than one ancestral species. The isolation
of populations in the crater lake habitats combined with

Barluenga and Meyer BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:326
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/326

the different selective pressures they are exposed to
(physicochemical conditions of the water, size and depth
of the lakes, predation and competition pressures due to
different biotic compositions, etc.), suggest that evolution in situ within these lakes is currently happening,
making this species complex a model system for the
study of parallel sympatric speciation. The differences in
the diversity of ecological and morphological forms
found in each lake could not simply be explained as an
effect of colonization by different ancestral lineages,
since the source populations for all of these crater lake
species assemblages were the same: the large Nicaraguan
lakes. It is remarkable that the obvious similarities in
ecological specializations due to ecological opportunities
- open water species such as A. zaliosus in Apoyo and
A. saggitae in Xiloá, only exist in deep crater lakes - are
absent from the source populations in the large lakes,
and arose independently and extremely rapidly in more
than one crater lake. Strong similarity can be found to
the situation of the stickleback species pairs of postglacial lakes. The Midas Cichlid community in each crater
lake is likely shaped by similar ecological and evolutionary forces that promote the evolution of equivalent ecological communities.

Methods
Sampling

Fish of the Midas Cichlid species complex were collected during the dry season (February-March) of 2001
and the wet seasons (November-December) of 2003 and
2005 with gill nets, harpooning while scuba diving, and
with the help of local fishermen, from twelve different
locations in Nicaragua, covering the main range in
which these species are found (with the exception of a
few smaller rivers and two isolated lakes, -Monte Galán
and Tiscapa). The collections included the two Large
Nicaraguan Lakes - L. Managua and L. Nicaragua
(including samples from several distant localities in each
lake, see Figure 1; Additional file 2, Table S4), and from
a pond (called Tisma) on the River Tipitapa that connects these two lakes. Also seven crater lakes (from
North to South: Asososca León, Apoyeque, Xiloá, Asososca Managua, Masaya and Apoyo; see Figure 1 and
Table 1 for details on age size depth and faunal composition of the crater lakes) were sampled. A water reservoir on the River Malacatoya that drains into Lake
Nicaragua, Las Canoas and River San Juan that drains
from Lake Nicaragua into the Atlantic Ocean were
sampled as well (Figure 1). All fish were photographed
in a standardized position for phenotypic characterization. All major body plans found in each water body
were described. Fish were sized, and fin clips and muscle samples were preserved in 90% ethanol for DNA
analyses. Whole fish or fish heads were taken as voucher

Page 16 of 20

specimens and to characterize the trophic apparatus. A
total of 2157 fish were collected (see Table 2 for sample
sizes per lake).
Microsatellite analysis

Total DNA was isolated using a proteinase K digestion
followed by sodium chloride extraction and ethanol precipitation [88]. Individuals were genotyped with 15
microsatellite loci (eight loci were developed specifically
for Amphilophus citrinellus: Acit1, Acit2, Acit3, Acit4,
Acit6, [89]; Unh011, Unh012, Unh013, McKaye et al.
2002; two published loci developed for other cichlid species: TmoM7, [90]; Unh002, [91]; and five newly developed loci: Abur28, Abur45, Abur82, Abur151, [92],
(Genbank accession numbers: EU564224, EU564237,
EU564256 and EU564292 respectively); BurtKit, Salzburger et al. unpubl.; see Additional file 2, Table S2), amplified with fluorescent reverse primers (HEX, FAM and
NED dyes) and fragment length was analyzed with the
internal size marker Genescan-500 ROX (Applied Biosystems) on an ABI 3100XL Automated Sequencer
(Applied Biosystems), and with GENESCAN v.3.7 and
GENOTYPER v.3.7 (Applied Biosystems) software
packages. Genotypes were checked for scoring errors
using MICRO-CHECKER v. 2.3 [93].
The basic descriptive statistics, number of alleles, FIS,
and the genetic diversity indexes allelic richness and
gene diversity were compiled for each population using
FSTAT v.2.9.3 [94]. We compared the statistical differentiation of the genetic diversity indexes between the
group formed by all the crater lakes and the group of all
populations in the large lakes and Tisma Pond with
FSTAT. Departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
for each locus across and within populations was calculated using a test analogous to Fisher’s exact tests [95]
estimated with a 100,000 step, 1,000 iteration, Markov
Chain Monte Carlo series of permutations, as implemented in ARLEQUIN v. 3.0 [96]. Linkage disequilibrium was tested for all possible pairs of loci in each
population and globally for each pair of loci across
populations with ARLEQUIN. Critical significance levels
for multiple testing were corrected following the
sequential Bonferroni procedure [97].
Two different approaches were used in an effort to
examine the genetic clustering of the populations in the
different lakes. First, the Bayesian clustering method as
implemented in STRUCTURE v. 2.2 [68] was used to
assess the grouping of individuals without prior information on their sampling location assuming admixture.
With this analysis we aimed to test for genetic similarity
within each water body. We included information about
species within the better studied crater lakes Xiloá and
Apoyo. This clustering method assumes a fixed number
of populations K and calculates the posterior probability

Barluenga and Meyer BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:326
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/326

of assigning individuals to each of the populations using
a variant of the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
method. Posterior probabilities were calculated in multiple runs, where each run consisted of 500,000 iterations
with a burn-in period of 50,000. We set K between 115, and performed 10 replicates for each value of K.
Pritchard et al. [68] suggest a method based upon marginal likelihoods to determine the minimal number of
populations needed to explain the data. Possible limitations of this method have been suggested [98]. Therefore we also used a method implemented in the
software STRUCTURAMA v.1.0 [99], where both the
assignment of individuals to populations and the number of populations are treated as random variables following a Dirichlet process prior [100]. This method
allows to directly estimate the number of populations,
and is suggested to provide more accurate estimations
of the number of populations [101]. The results of this
clustering method were plotted with the software DISTRUCT v. 1.1 [102].
Second, a Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) of
individual diploid genotypes was performed as implemented in GENALEX v.6 [103] to visualize the two
dimensional clustering of populations. Several analyses
were performed by successively removing the most differentiated populations to reveal all levels of differentiation among populations (Figure 4). Tests of the
significance of total inertia and individual axes inertia,
as well as F ST differentiation per axes were calculated
with 1000 permutations with PCAGEN v.1.0 [104].
In the last two analyses (PCoA and Bayesian clustering) in order to have a compensated number of samples
due to software limitations, we used only a subset of the
samples representing all localities and morphotypes of
the fish with a maximum of 100 individuals per lake
and species.
mtDNA analyses

The complete mitochondrial control region (836 bp) was
PCR amplified using published primers and reaction conditions (L-Pro-F, [105]; 12S5R, 5’-GGC GGA TAC TTG
CAT GT-3’) on a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 Thermocyler (Applied Biosystems). The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were purified using the QIAquick
PCR purification kit (QIAGEN), and sequenced in both
directions with the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing
Ready Reaction kit (Applied Biosystems). Sequencing
products were analyzed on an ABI 3100 Automated
Sequencer (Applied Biosystems) (see Additional file 1,
Table S1 for GenBank accession numbers).
Mitochondrial DNA sequences were aligned using the
software SEQUENCHER v. 4.2 (Gene Code Corporation)
and verified by eye. The alignment was collapsed into the

Page 17 of 20

representative haplotypes with COLLAPSE v. 1.2 http://
darwin.uvigo.es/software/collapse.html, but the information about the frequencies of haplotypes was preserved.
Number of haplotypes, proportion of private alleles, and
nucleotide diversity [106] per lake and species were calculated with ARLEQUIN. A maximum likelihood (ML) tree
was constructed with PAUP* v. 4.0b10 [107]. A model of
sequence evolution was chosen applying jMODELTEST v.
0.1 [108]. jMODELTEST revealed that the optimal model
of molecular evolution was the unequal-frequency Kimura
3-parameter plus Gamma correction (0.68) and a proportion of invariable sites of 0.58% (K81uf+I+G). On the basis
of the obtained tree, a haplotype network including geographic information and frequency of haplotypes was built
(Figure 2). The ML tree was translated into an unrooted
tree with maximum parsimony branch lengths in order to
associate each branch with mutational steps. Gaps were
incorporated in the definition of the haplotypes for the
construction of the network.
A mismatch analysis was performed to estimate the
demographic history of the species complex from each
of the lakes (Figure 3, Table 3). The fit of the observed
pairwise mismatch distributions to a sudden expansion
demographic model was tested using a generalized least
square procedure and by computing the raggedness
index of the observed distributions [109] as implemented in ARLEQUIN. The validity of a stepwise expansion
model for the data was tested using Markov Chain
Monte Carlo simulations (1000 steps) with ARLEQUIN.
We computed the moment estimator of the age of the
expansion (τ), and the mutation parameters θ0 (2 μN0)
and θ1 (2 μN1) using a parametric bootstrap approach
(1000 simulations), where μ is the mutation rate and N
is the female effective population size. Tajima’s D [110]
analysis was performed with ARLEQUIN as an additional test of population expansion.
Genetic differences among and within lakes were estimated with pairwise F-statistics [111] as implemented in
ARLEQUIN. Critical significance levels for multiple testing were corrected following the sequential Bonferroni
procedure [97].
