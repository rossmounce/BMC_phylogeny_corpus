Abstract
Background: ECE-CYC2 clade genes known in patterning floral dorsoventral asymmetry
(zygomorphy) in Antirrhinum majus are conserved in the dorsal identity function including arresting
the dorsal stamen. However, it remains uncertain whether the same mechanism underlies abortion
of the ventral stamens, an important morphological trait related to evolution and diversification of
zygomorphy in Lamiales sensu lato, a major clade of predominantly zygomorphically flowered
angiosperms. Opithandra (Gesneriaceae) is of particular interests in addressing this question as it is
in the base of Lamiales s.l., an early representative of this type zygomorphy.
Results: We investigated the expression patterns of four ECE-CYC2 clade genes and two putative
target cyclinD3 genes in Opithandra using RNA in situ hybridization and RT-PCR. OpdCYC gene
expressions were correlated with abortion of both dorsal and ventral stamens in Opithandra,
strengthened by the negatively correlated expression of their putative target OpdcyclinD3 genes.
The complement of OpdcyclinD3 to OpdCYC expressions further indicated that OpdCYC expressions
were related to the dorsal and ventral stamen abortion through negative effects on OpdcyclinD3
genes.
Conclusion: These results suggest that ECE-CYC2 clade TCP genes are not only functionally
conserved in the dorsal stamen repression, but also involved in arresting ventral stamens, a genetic
mechanism underlying the establishment of zygomorphy with abortion of both the dorsal and
ventral stamens evolved in angiosperms, especially within Lamiales s.l.

Background
One important event during the evolution of angiosperms
is the emergence of flower bilateral symmetry, i.e. zygomorphy, a key innovation associated with important
adaptive radiations [1]. Several zygomorphic clades have
independently evolved successfully from actinomorphic
ancestors in angiosperms, including Lamiales sensu lato

that includes a major genetic model organism snapdragon
(Antirrhinum majus) [2,3].
In A.majus, CYCLOIDEA (CYC) and DICHOTOMA
(DICH) are essential for the development of dorsoventral
asymmetry in flowers due to their dorsal identity function, i.e. controlling the fate of the dorsal floral organs in

the second and third whorls [4,5]. CYC promotes cell
expansion in the dorsal petals, while it arrests the growth
of the dorsal stamen to become a staminode [4,5]. Meanwhile, DICH activity affects the internal asymmetry of the
dorsal petals [4,5]. The ability of CYC to arrest the dorsal
stamen depends on its negative effect on expression of
cell-cycle genes, such as cyclin D3b [3,6]. CYC and DICH
encode proteins within the ECE-CYC2 clade (ECE lineage,
CYC/TB1 subfamily) in the TCP family of transcription
factors with TCP domain related to cell proliferation [3,712]. In legumes, distantly related to A. majus, several CYC
homologues, such as LjCYC2 in Lotus and PsCYC2 in pea,
also have the function in establishing dorsal identity in
legume flowers [13,14]. In Arabidopsis thaliana, a model
eudicot species with ancestrally actinomorphic flowers,
and its close relative Iberis amara, CYC homologues, TCP1
and IaTCP1 genes are characteristic of dorsal identity
function, in which IaTCP1 dorsal-specific expression
represses the two dorsal petal development in Iberis amara
[15,16]. Recent studies in the sunflower family (Asteraceae) show that CYC-like genes, i.e. RAY1, RAY2 in Senecio and GhCYC2 in Gerbera, have played a key role in the
establishment and evolution of the capitulate inflorescence [17,18]. Therefore, it is suggested that CYC-like TCP
genes have been recruited multiple times for a role of dorsal identity and its modifications in establishing zygomorphy in core eudicots [3,19]. Even though the genetic
control for the floral dorsoventral asymmetry has been
intensively studied in model systems, it is still a great challenge to explain how modifications of development led to
the transformation among different types of zygomorphy
and the morphological diversification of zygomorphy in
angiosperms, especially in Lamiales s.l., a major clade of
predominantly zygomorphically flowered angiosperms.
Zygomorphy is believed to be ancestral in Lamiales s.l.
[2,19,20]. Most zygomorphic groups in Lamiales s.l. have
a pentamerous perianth with four stamens plus a dorsal
staminode and two carpels as in A.majus. However, there
is a great variation in morphology and number of corolla
lobes and stamens [1]. The dorsal staminode can be completely lost as in Rehmannia and Veronica (Scrophulariaceae sensu lato) [2,21,22] and the two lateral stamens
may become aborted instead of one dorsal staminode as
in Mohavea (Scrophulariaceae s.l.) and Chirita (Gesneriaceae) [23-25]. In some cases, the two ventral stamens
may become staminodes rather than the lateral stamens
and the dorsal one, such as in Opithandra and Epithema
(Gesneriaceae) [24]. In extreme cases, each flower may
have only a single stamen as in Hippuris (Scrophulariaceae
s.l.) [20]. In Mohavea, a close relative of A. majus, there is
a derived floral morphology with abortion of both the
dorsal and lateral stamens unlike the flowers of A.majus
with abortion of only the dorsal stamen [23]. The derived
floral morphology of Mohavea is correlated with the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/244

expression changes of McCYC/McDICH via CYC/DICH,
i.e. expansion from the dorsal to both the dorsal and lateral stamens [23]. A similar correlation of expanded
expression of CYC-like genes with abortion of both the
dorsal and lateral stamens is also observed in Chirita (Gesneriaceae) [25]. However, we are still not clear about the
abortion of the ventral stamens that has been involved in
the evolutionary shifts of stamen number during the morphological diversification of zygomorphy in Lamiales s.l.
[1].
In addition, in the backpetals mutant in A.majus, the
ectopic expression of CYC in the lateral and ventral positions results in a dorsalized corolla. However, it seems
likely that the androecial development is not affected by
the ectopic expression of CYC because the two lateral and
two ventral stamens are still fertile [5,26]. In the actinomorphic flower of legume Cadia, no LegCYC1B mRNA is
detected in stamens [27]. It is hard to determine whether
LegCYC1B or other CYC homologues in legumes have a
role in controlling androecial development from data to
date [13,14,21]. RAY2 in Senecio and GhCYC2 in Gerbera
(Asteraceae) mainly promote the growth of the ligule (the
ventral petals) in ray florets and are excluded from the
dorsal rudimentary petals [17,18]. In Veronica and Gratiola (Scrophulariaceae s.l.), some of CYC-like genes have
dorsal-specific expressions while some have lost this feature, but their expressions do not correlate with ventral
stamen arrest [21]. Therefore, expression data correlated
with the ventral stamen abortion have not been reported
yet for members of the ECE-CYC2 clade. It is uncertain
whether abortion of the ventral stamens is related to CYClike gene activities or to the effect of an unknown analogous counterpart of CYC-like genes, such as members of
ECE-CYC3 clade or other factors [3,12,20].
The family Gesneriaceae is sister to the remainder of Lamiales s.l. [28] and has diverse forms of zygomorphy relating to the floral organ differentiation early in the order
[1,2,24]. In Gesneriaceae, Opithandra exhibits a peculiar
floral morphology, where only the two lateral stamens are
fertile and both the dorsal and ventral stamens are
aborted in the third whorl (Figure 1). Phylogenetic analyses suggest that the floral morphology of Opithandra is
likely derived from a weakly zygomorphic flower with
four fertile stamens and a dorsal staminode [24]. Therefore, Opithandra represents an ideal candidate for exploring a potentially novel genetic mechanism underlying the
establishment of zygomorphy with ventral stamen arrest
in angiosperms, especially in Lamiales s.l.
Here we report that there is a correlation between OpdCYC
gene expressions and abortion of both the dorsal and ventral stamens in Opithandra, strengthened by the negatively
correlated expression of their putative direct target

Results
Sequence and phylogenetic analyses of OpdCYC and
OpdcyclinD3
We isolated four CYC-like genes from Opithandra dinghushanensis, named OpdCYC1C, OpdCYC1D, OpdCYC2A
and OpdCYC2B. The full length open reading frames
(ORFs) of OpdCYC1C, OpdCYC1D, OpdCYC2A and
OpdCYC2B are 1017 base pair (bp), 1038 bp, 1044 bp and

993 bp, respectively (Additional file 1A). Sequence analyses show that they share 43-48% and 45-51% identity
with AmCYC at nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. When comparing the TCP and R domains, they
share 90-95% identity with AmCYC at the amino acid
level, suggesting they are functionally related. Phylogenetic analyses show that OpdCYC genes have a close relationship with AmCYC and AmDICH, and, along with
AmCYC and TCP1, belong to the ECE-CYC2 clade in the
ECE lineage (CYC/TB1 subfamily) of TCP gene family
[12] (Figure 2A) (We have not found a member of the
ECE-CYC3 clade yet in Gesneriaceae, probably failed to

primers for this clade). OpdCYC genes are closely related
to GCYC from Oreocharis among GCYC genes in Gesneriaceae (Figure 2B).
Two D3-type cyclin genes, designated as OpdcyclinD3a and
OpdcyclinD3b, were isolated from O. dinghushanensis with
full length ORFs of 1563 bp and 1200 bp, respectively
(Additional file 1B). The two D3-type cyclin genes contain
a cyclin box [29] and the putative (Rb)-binding motif
(LxCxE, where x is any amino acid) which are found both
in animals [30,31] and plants [6,32,33]. Phylogenetic
analyses show that OpdcyclinD3 genes belong to
cyclinD3a and cyclinD3b clade, respectively, in the
cyclinD3 lineages, in which they have close relations with
AmcyclinD3a and AmcyclinD3b from A.majus, respectively (Figure 2C).
Gene mRNA expression patterns
To assess the potential role of CYC-like genes in floral
development, we conducted in situ hybridization comple-

mented by gene-specific RT-PCR on O. dinghushanensis. As
petal and stamen primordia began to emerge, OpdCYC1C
mRNA was detected in all five petal and stamen primordia
(Figure 3A). Weak mRNA signals were also detectable in
the lateral edges and vascular tissue of sepals (Figure 3A).
After primordial initiation of petals and stamens,
OpdCYC1C expression signals were gradually weakened in
the two lateral stamens (Figure 3B-D) with weak mRNA
detected in the ring meristem of the corolla-tube outside
the stamen primordia (Figure 3B-C). Figures 3C and 3D
were the successive sections from the same individual
flower across the base of stamen primordia (3C) and over
their upper parts (3D), respectively, which showed a size
reduction from the base to the upper part of the dorsal
and ventral stamens. The mRNA signal of OpdCYC1C was
weak in lateral stamens while strong in both dorsal and
ventral staminodes in which its mRNA signal was stronger
in the upper part than at the base (Figure 3C-D).
OpdCYC1C mRNA also accumulated less in lateral petals
than in dorsal and ventral petals (Figure 3D). As the lat-

shifted to peripheries and gradually became undetectable
in the two lateral stamens, while OpdCYC1C transcripts
continued to accumulate to a high level in the dorsal and
ventral staminodes (Figure 3E-F). Meanwhile, OpdCYC1C
mRNA became weak and not easily detectable in petals
(Figure 3E-F). Weak mRNA signals of OpdCYC1C were
also detected in the gynoecial primordium (Figure 3E). In
the middle developmental stages with flower buds about
8 mm long, as stamens began filament elongation and

anther differentiation, OpdCYC1C was strongly expressed
in the dorsal region (the dorsal petals and staminode) and
ventral staminode shown in RT-PCR while its weak mRNA
signal was detected in sepals, lateral and ventral petals,
and lateral stamens, in which the signal was much weaker
in sepals and lateral stamens (Figure 4A, C). In the late
stages, OpdCYC1C transcripts declined in the dorsal
region and ventral staminodes, and were undetectable in
other regions (Figure 4B-C). The OpdCYC1C mRNA was
undetectable in stamens as pollen sacs began develop-

ment in the two lateral anthers while the two ventral
anthers became sterile (Figure 3G).
In contrast to OpdCYC1C, OpdCYC2A mRNA densely
accumulated in the dorsal region of the floral apex as petals and stamens became visible (Figure 3H). Then, the
OpdCYC2A expression signal was specifically concentrated in the dorsal petals and the dorsal staminode (Figure 3I-J). As floral organs developed, OpdCYC2A
transcripts continued to be highly concentrated at the dorsal staminode and the dorsal-most parts of the two dorsal

petals (Figure 3J-K). In the middle stages, the strong
mRNA signal of OpdCYC2A was detected in the dorsal
region (the dorsal petals and staminode) shown in RTPCR that declined in late stages with no signal in other
regions (Figure 4A-B, D). Its mRNA was undetectable in
stamens as pollen sacs began development in the two lateral anthers while the two ventral anthers became sterile
(Figure 3L). Even though OpdCYC1D expression was
undetectable in floral tissues using in situ hybridization
(Figure 3M), its very weak mRNA signals were detected in
the dorsal region (the dorsal petals and staminode) from

middle to late stages using RT-PCR (Figure 4A-B).
OpdCYC2B mRNA was not detectable in floral tissues
both using in situ hybridization and RT-PCR (Figure 3N,
Figure 4A-B). No signal was detected in floral tissues with
sense probes of OpdCYC1C (Figure 3O) and OpdCYC2A
(Figure 3P).
To further elucidate the role of OpdCYC genes in floral
development of Opithandra dinghushanensis, we carried
out semiquantitative RT-PCR studies of two OpdcyclinD3
genes because cyclinD3 genes were previously revealed to
be negatively controlled by CYC as shown in the mid-tolate stage flowers in the model organism snapdragon [6].
RT-PCR results showed that OpdcyclinD3a was strongly
expressed in lateral stamens from middle to late stages
while its weak mRNA signal was also detected in lateral
and ventral petals (Figure 4A-B, E). OpdcyclinD3a mRNA
was not detected either in the dorsal region (the dorsal
petals and staminode) and ventral staminodes (Figure 4AB, E). OpdcyclinD3b transcripts were widely distributed in
floral tissues except ventral staminodes, in which its
mRNA signal was strong in lateral stamens from middle to
late stages (Figure 4A-B, F). Transcripts of OpdcyclinD3b
detected in the dorsal region were likely mainly distributed in the dorsal petals (OpdcyclinD3b mRNA was uneasily detectable in the dorsal staminode using in situ
hybridization (data not shown)).

Discussion
The androecium of Opithandra only has two fertile stamens at the lateral positions with three sterile stamens
(staminodes) at the dorsal and ventral sides (Figure 1)
(also see [24]). The dorsal aborted stamen is tiny and
barely detectable at anthesis while the two infertile ventral
stamens have short filaments with very small and sterile
anthers (Figure 1B-C). Correlative with the differentiation
along the dorsoventral axis of the morphologically peculiar androecium, the OpdCYC2A strong expression is
restricted to the dorsal staminode while OpdCYC1C transcripts are initially distributed in all five stamen primordia
but later are concentrated in the dorsal and ventral staminodes to late stages. In the ECE lineage of CYC/TB1 subfamily, the TCP proteins in ECE-CYC2 clade studied to
date function as negative regulators in stamen development, whereas they appear to vary in petal development
according
to
the
trait
concerned
[35,9,10,12,17,23,25,34,35]. The abortion of the dorsal stamen in Antirrhinum comes from CYC and DICH activities
[4,5]. The CYC-like gene expression expansion from the
dorsal to both the dorsal and lateral stamens is correlated
with abortion of both the dorsal and lateral stamens in
Mohavea and Chirita [23,25]. TB1 gene exhibits a mix feature of ECE-CYC1 and ECE-CYC2 clades and functions to
suppress axillary meristem (CYC1) while retard stamen
growth (CYC2) in maize [3,12,34]. In Asteraceae, a CYC

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/244

homologue GhCYC2 from Gerbera functions by disrupting
stamen development [17]. Given that CYC-like gene
(ECE-CYC2 clade) function is conserved in repressing stamen development, OpdCYC2A expression restricted to the
dorsal stamen and OpdCYC1C expression later concentrated in the dorsal and ventral stamens in the third whorl
might be related to abortion of the dorsal and ventral stamens in Opithandra. In fact, the successive sections from
the same individual flower indicate that correlative with
OpdCYC gene strong expression, the early primordial
growth have already been retarded in the dorsal and ventral staminodes in comparison with that in the lateral stamens.
Evidence shows that CYC functions to repress stamen
development in the third whorl through its negative effect
on expression of D3-type cyclin genes, including
cyclinD3b, which usually play an important role in locally
regulating cell proliferation in floral development
[3,6,36]. The negative effects on cell cycle progression
have been reported from other TCP genes, such as IaTCP1
from Iberis (Brassicaceae), TCP2 and TCP4 from Arabidopsis, and CIN from Antirrhinum [16,37,38]. We, therefore,
investigated the expression pattern of OpdcyclinD3a and
D3b to test for further correlation between CYC expression
and stamen abortion through cell-cycle regulation, especially the ventral stamens. In strengthening the above suggestion, OpdcyclinD3 genes have expression patterns in
floral tissues negatively correlated with those of OpdCYC
genes and stamen abortion in Opithandra. Both Opdcyclin
D3a and D3b transcripts are not detected, or weakly
detected (i.e. dorsal), in the dorsal and ventral staminodes
where both OpdCYC2A and OpdCYC1C or OpdCYC1C are
strongly and continuously expressed throughout floral
development, while their transcripts are much more concentrated in the lateral stamens where there is only a weak
expression of OpdCYC1C in early stages. These factors
indicate that OpdCYC gene activities may suppress the
development of the dorsal and ventral stamens through
negatively regulating OpdcyclinD3 genes (Figure 5). Our
recent findings of consensus-binding sites of the TCP transcription factor in the 5' upstream regions of OpdcyclinD3
homologues, i.e. ChcyclinD3a and D3b in Chirita heterotricha, further support the direct regulatory relation
between CYC-like and cyclinD3 genes in Gesneriaceae
(Yang, Xia and Wang, Yin-Zheng, unpublished).
It seemingly remains a question whether OpdCYC activity
is related to the lateral stamen development or not
because OpdCYC1C has a weak expression in the early
developing lateral stamens but has no obvious effect on
their growth. The evidence that CYC-like genes regulate
lateral stamen development comes from both functional
analyses in Antirrhinum and expression data in Mohavea
and Chirita [3,4,21,23,25]. A gradient of CYC effect along

with five fertile stamens in Bournea [35]. According to
Cubas [1], the maintenance of CYC expression after early
floral development should be important for generating
the morphological asymmetries in the flowers. Preston
and Hileman [3] also suggest that early expression of CYClike genes may be unimportant for establishing mature
flower symmetry. The high concentration of OpdcyclinD3a
and D3b transcripts in the lateral stamens also indicates
that OpdCYC1C has lost negative effects on their expression after early floral development; therefore, the two lateral stamens are fertile at anthesis in Opithandra (Figure
5).

the dorsoventral axis results in abortion of the dorsal stamen and reduced size of lateral stamens in comparison
with ventral ones in A. majus, while CYC-like gene strong
and continuous expressions in both the dorsal and lateral
stamens is correlated with abortion of both of them in
Mohavea and Chirita [4,23,25,26]. The TCP1 gene is
expressed early in floral buds of Arabidopsis, but the
mature flowers of Arabidopsis are actinomorphic because
they lack later effects of TCP1 [12,15]. In Iberis amara
closely related to Arabidopsis, the IaTCP1 strong dorsalspecific expression represses the two dorsal petal growths
to become much smaller than the ventral ones in size,
while IaTCP1 has only a weak expressional signal in the
natural actinomorphic variants [16]. In the tetrandrous
flowers of Oreocharis that is closely related to Opithandra
in both morphology and GCYC phylogeny [24] (Figure
2B), there is also a weak expression of CYC homologue
ObCYC in the early developing lateral stamens that are
reduced in size compared with ventral ones at anthesis as
in A. majus [39]. In Bournea, another Opithandra's close
relative with actinomorphic flowers in Gesneriaceae, the
CYC homologue BlCYC1 is strongly expressed in the dorsal petal and stamen in early development and is downregulated later, which is correlated with the floral
development undergoing a morphological transition
from initial zygomorphy to actinomorphy at anthesis

Zygomorphic flowers with three staminodes at the dorsal
and lateral positions or at the dorsal and ventral sides
have been considered to be derived in the family Gesneriaceae [24,40-42]. In the primitive zygomorphic taxa,
such as Haberlea and Oreocharis characteristic of tetrandrous flowers with four didynamous stamens plus a dorsal staminode, and the derived actinomorphic groups
(definition see note in [35]), such as Ramonda and
Bournea, there is only one single copy of GCYC1 and
GCYC2, respectively, found to date (Figure 2B)
[35,39,43,44]. However, two copies of GCYC1 are frequently found in the advanced zygomorphic taxa, especially in the zygomorphic genera characterized by
diandrous flowers with three staminodes, such as two
African genera Streptocarpus and Saintpaulia with GCYC1A
and GCYC1B [44,45] and Asian genera Didymocarpus,
Chirita and Loxostigma with GCYC1C and GCYC1D
[25,46] as well as Opithandra herein (Figure 2B). Recent
studies show that two copies of GCYC2 (GCYC2A/2B) are
also found in the Asian genera with three staminodes,
such as Chirita [25] and Opithandra in this study (Figure
2B). The derived morphology of diandrous flowers might
have resulted from subsequent expression differentiation
after gene duplication events. In the diandrous flowers of
Chirita (also Gesneriaceae) that differs from Opithandra in
abortion of both the dorsal and lateral stamens rather
than ventral stamens, ChCYC1C is strongly expressed
both in the dorsal and lateral stamens while ChCYC1D
maintains strong expressions in the dorsal floral regions,
and ChCYC2A/2B have no expression signals in floral tissues [25]. No expression of GCYC2 detected in floral tissue is frequently found in Gesneriaceae while GCYC1 is
usually conserved in dorsal-specific expression in this
family, such as Oreocharis and Bournea [35,39]. Therefore,
the peculiar diandrous flowers established in Opithandra
might involved not only gained or enhanced expression
of OpdCYC1C in ventral staminodes but also the reactivated expression of OpdCYC2A specific to the dorsal staminode accompanied with the downregulation of
OpdCYC1D in the dorsal region in the third whorl, a more
complicated mechanism than that in another diandrous
flowers of Chirita.

Phylogenetic analyses show that the CYC-like genes isolated from Opithandra and other Gesneriaceae belong to
ECE-CYC2 clade as CYC and TCP1 from Antirrhinum and
Arabidopsis (Figure 2B) [25,35,39,45]. As outlined above,
ECE-CYC2 clade genes are characteristic of dorsal identity
function which sometimes expands to lateral stamens
[4,5,21,23,25,35,39]. It would be especially interesting to
know whether or how CYC-like gene activities are related
to abortion of the ventral stamens [3,12,20]. Even though
not tested functionally, this positive correlation between
CYC-like gene expression and ventral stamen abortion
and the complement of cyclinD3 to CYC-like gene expressions suggests a genetic mechanism underlying the establishment of zygomorphy with abortion of both the dorsal
and ventral stamen evolved within Lamiales s.l.. However,
it has been shown for Veronica and Gratiola (also Lamiales
s.l.) that the CYC-like gene expression does not positively
correlate with the ventral stamen abortion (Preston et al.,
2009). These facts inconsonant in the expression data of
ECE-CYC2 clade TCP genes imply that the ventral stamen
abortion might have evolved by convergent genetic mechanisms in different lineages of Lamiales s.l.. It merits further research in function and upstream regulatory
pathway to determine how the expression divergence is
caused among paralogues of OpdCYC in Opithandra. In
addition, since the diverse variations of zygomorphy in
Lamiales s.l. might have involved independent shifts in
stamen number [3,21], further investigation of expression
pattern and functional analyses of CYC-like genes with
identification of their upstream cis- or trans-regulators as
well as research in finding other factors possibly coopted
to this regulatory pathway in more zygomorphic groups
would shed new lights on the mechanisms that underlie
the vast morphological diversity of zygomorphy in Lamiales s.l..

Conclusion
As the first to document the expression domain of ECECYC clade genes in the ventral stamens, we here report
that the expressions of OpdCYC genes are correlated with
abortion of both dorsal and ventral stamens in Opithandra, strengthened by the negatively correlated expression of their putative direct target OpdcyclinD3 genes. The
complement of OpdcyclinD3 to OpdCYC gene expressions
further indicates that OpdCYC expressions are related to
the dorsal and ventral stamen abortion through the negative effect on OpdcyclinD3 genes. The novel patterns of
CYC-like gene expressions in Opithandra, along with previous reports, suggest that ECE-CYC2 clade TCP genes are
not only functionally conserved in the dorsal stamen
repression, but also involved in arresting ventral stamens,
a genetic mechanism underlying the establishment of
zygomorphy with abortion of both the dorsal and ventral
stamens evolved within Lamiales s.l.. It would be important to further find whether ECE-CYC2 clade TCP genes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/244

are recruited repeatedly for arresting ventral stamens and
(or) whether there is any other genetic pathways underlying the ventral stamen abortion, independently or interacting with ECE-CYC2 clade TCP genes, in different
lineages of Lamiales s.l..

Methods
Plant materials
All materials used in this study, including gene cloning, in
situ hybridization and RT-PCR, were collected from the
wild fields, i.e. Dinghu Mountains, Guangdong province,
China, where plants of Opithandra dinghushanensis W. T.
Wang are mainly distributed.
Gene cloning and sequence analyses
CYC-like genes were isolated from O.dinghushanensis
using degenerate oligonucleotide primers in 3' and 5'RACE according to described methods [47] and the manufacture's protocol (INVITROGEN), respectively. Two D3type cyclin genes were also isolated from O. dinghushanensis using the above methods. Total RNA was extracted
from the floral buds of O. dinghushanensis using the Plant
RNA Purification Reagent (INVITROGEN) according to
the manufacture's protocol. First-strand cDNAs were synthesized from total RNA with the Supertranscript™ III
RNase H- Reverse Transcriptase (INVITROGEN). To examine the intron/exon structures we isolated and sequenced
the corresponding genomic DNA of OpdCYC and
OpdcyclinD3 genes from leaves. The Oligonucleotide
sequences for primers are included in the Additional
Material - Additional file 2.

According to the known sequence information, phylogenetic analyses of CYC-like and D-type cyclin genes were
conducted to identify the position of CYC-like and D3type cyclin genes isolated herein in their gene families,
respectively. AmCYC and AmDICH are from A. majus
[4,5], and LjCYC1/2/3, TCP1/12/18 and TB1 are from
Lotus japonicus [13], Arabidopsis [12] and maize [34].
GCYC1A/1B are from Saintpaulia ionantha and Streptocarpus primulifolius [43-45]. GCYC1C/1D (designated as
GCYC1 respectively in some taxa) are from Chirita heterotricha [25], Jankaea heldeichii [43], Conandron ramondioides, Haberlea ferdinandi-coburgii, Primulina tabacum,
Ramonda myconi [44], Cyrtandra apiculata, Didymocarpus
citrinus and Loxostigma sp. [46]. GCYC2 (2A/2B) are from
Chirita heterotricha [25], Conandron ramondioides, Haberlea
ferdinandi-coburgii, Ramonda myconi [44], Cyrtandra apiculata [46] and Didymocarpus citrinus (Yin-Zheng Wang,
unpublished). Amino acid sequences of D-type cyclin
genes are from A. majus (Amcyclin D1/D3a/D3b) [6], Populus trichocarpa (Ptcyclin D1/D2/D3) [48], Nicotiana tabacum (Ntcyclin D/D3) [49], Solanum tuberosum (Stcyclin D)
(accession nos.EU325650), Lycopersicon esculentum (Lecyclin D3-1) [50] and Arabidopsis (Atcyclin D1/D2/D3) [32].

Phylogenetic analyses with the neighbor joining method
and p-distance were carried out using PAUP*4.0b4a [51]
and bootstrap was estimated with 1,000 resampling replicates. The DNA sequences of genes reported in this paper,
i.e. OpdCYC1C, OpdCYC1D, OpdCYC2A, OpdCYC2B,
OpdcyclinD3a and OpdcyclinD3b have been deposited in
the GenBank database (accession nos. FJ710518,
FJ710519, FJ710520, FJ710521, FJ710522 and
FJ644637).
RNA in situ hybridization
Floral tissue for in situ hybridization was fixed, sectioned
and hybridized to digoxygenin-labeled probes of
OpdCYC1C, OpdCYC1D, OpdCYC2A and OpdCYC2B with
reference to described methods [52]. Four gene-specific
fragments of OpdCYC1C, OpdCYC1D, OpdCYC2A and
OpdCYC2B in the coding region were amplified, respectively, and then were purified and cloned into pGEM®-T
Easy vectors. Digoxygenin-labeled probes of OpdCYC1C,
OpdCYC1D, OpdCYC2A and OpdCYC2B were prepared
from linearized templates amplified using primer Yt7 and
Ysp6 from pGEM®-T plasmids [53]. The oligonucleotide
sequences for primers are included in the Additional
Material - Additional file 2.
Gene-specific semiquantitative RT-PCR
Flowers of different stages were collected as follows:
Flower buds of middle-stage (less than 1 cm long) and
flowers of late-stage (3-4 cm long) were collected separately. Sepals were removed from the outer whorl. The
petals with corresponding corolla-tube were dissected
into dorsal (including the attached dorsal staminode), lateral, and ventral regions. Lateral stamens and ventral
staminodes were dissected from the corolla-tube and collected each for RT-PCR. All materials were frozen in liquid
nitrogen immediately after collection for ribonucleic acid
(RNA) isolation. The extraction of total RNAs, purification of poly (A) mRNAs, and synthesis of the first-strand
cDNAs were performed according to the methods
described above. The template quantity was regulated to
be uniform using the ACTIN gene [54]. PCR was performed by using gene-specific primers of OpdCYC1C,
OpdCYC1D, OpdCYC2A, OpdCYC2B, OpdcyclinD3a and
OpdcyclinD3b. To make sure that each pair of primers was
suitable, we first used them to amplify genomic DNA of
O. dinghushanensis. The PCR products were then cloned.
At least 20 clones of each PCR product were sequenced,
and all the primers used could amplify the specific copies
of OpdCYC and OpdcyclinD3 genes. The following thermocycling conditions were employed: initial denaturation at 96°C for 3 min, 30 cycles of 96°C for 30 s, 5560°C (depending on the Tm value of primer pairs) for
30s, and 72°C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72°C for
10 min. The amplified products were separated on a 1.5%
agarose gel, and the density of ethidium bromide-stained

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/244

bands was determined using a Bioimaging System (Gene
Tools Program, Syngene, UK). We repeated the RT-PCR
experiments five times independently with a new RNA
extraction each time. In addition, all RT-PCR products
were cloned into pGEM-T Easy-vector, and at least 20
clones from each product were sequenced to test the gene
specificity of RT-PCR. The OpdCYC/ACTIN and Opdcyclin/
ACTIN ratios represented the relative level of OpdCYC and
OpdcyclinD3 mRNA expression. Data are presented as the
mean ± SD of independent RT-PCR experiments, and oneway analysis of variance was used to analyze the expression difference of these transcripts in floral tissue from O.
dinghushanensis. A P value less than 0.05 was taken to indicate statistical significance. The oligonucleotide sequences
for primers are included in the Additional Material - Additional file 2.
