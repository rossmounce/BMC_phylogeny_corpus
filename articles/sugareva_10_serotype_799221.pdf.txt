Serotype- and strain- dependent contribution of
the sensor kinase CovS of the CovRS twocomponent system to Streptococcus pyogenes
pathogenesis

Abstract
Background: The Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococci, GAS) two-component signal transduction system
CovRS has been described to be important for pathogenesis of this exclusively human bacterial species. If this
system acts uniquely in all serotypes is currently unclear. Presence of serotype- or strain-dependent regulatory
circuits and polarity is an emerging scheme in Streptococcus pyogenes pathogenesis. Thus, the contribution of the
sensor kinase (CovS) of the global regulatory two-component signal transduction system CovRS on pathogenesis of
several M serotypes was investigated.
Results: CovS mutation uniformly repressed capsule expression and hampered keratinocyte adherence in all tested
serotypes. However, a serotype- and even strain-dependent contribution on survival in whole human blood and
biofilm formation was noted, respectively.
Conclusions: These data provide new information on the action of the CovS sensor kinase and revealed that its
activity on capsule expression and keratinocyte adherence is uniform across serotypes, whereas the influence on
biofilm formation and blood survival is serotype or even strain dependent. This adds the CovRS system to a
growing list of serotype-specific acting regulatory loci in S. pyogenes.

Background
Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus, GAS) is
an important and exclusively human pathogen, which
causes a variety of diseases ranging from mild superficial
infections to invasive life-threatening illnesses with high
mortality rates [1-4]. Successful colonization and persistence within the host relies on sensing and responding
to the changes in the environmental conditions. These
responses are very often mediated by two-component
signal transduction regulatory systems (TCS). The
CovRS (also called CsrRS, [5]) system is one of 13 TCS
in the GAS genome, which has been extensively studied,
and for which a central role in growth and pathogenesis
was found [6-8]. CovR represses either directly or indirectly about 15% of the genes in GAS [9-11], many of

which represent important virulence factors. CovR acts
as a negative regulator of hyaluronic acid capsule biosynthesis by repression of the hyaluronic acid capsule
(has) operon [5]. Additional virulence genes influenced
by CovRS include ska (encoding streptokinase), sagA
(encoding streptolysin S), sda (encoding streptococcal
DNase) and speB (encoding a cysteine protease) [11,12].
CovRS activity modulates the transcriptome during
growth in human blood [13]. Furthermore, mutations in
CovRS lead to strains with enhanced virulence in animal
models of skin and soft tissue infections [8,9,12]. A
paper by Trevino et al. published during the review of
this work investigated the influence of CovS on the
CovR-mediated repression of GAS virulence factorencoding genes [14].
The first step in GAS infection is the adherence of
GAS to epithelia of the skin and respiratory tract, a process that is intensively studied on the molecular level
[15-17]. This phenomenon is supported by host

extracellular matrix proteins, such as collagen and fibronectin. The mechanism of adherence is enabled mainly
by specific adhesion components on the GAS surface
commonly termed MSCRAMMs (for microbial surface
components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules)
[16], which are under the control of several single
response regulators and several two-component systems.
Furthermore, the expression profile of the GAS
MSCRAMMs is time - and serotype-dependent [16].
The initial adhesion process of GAS to matrix protein
coated or an uncoated surface essentially contributes to
the biofilm formation, a novel described feature of many
clinically important serotypes of GAS [17]. Former studies showed that CovRS regulation appears to be critical
for biofilm formation [18]. Recently, studies on biofilm
regulation revealed, that streptococcal regulator of virulence (Srv) is also required for biofilm formation [19].
Increasing evidence now suggests that many GAS
virulence traits and even the polarity of transcriptional
regulatory circuits are serotype- and sometimes strainspecific [20,21]. Consequently, the importance of serotype- or strain- dependent CovS contribution to S. pyogenes pathogenesis was investigated. The CovS sensor
kinase part of the two-component system was inactivated by insertional mutagenesis in different M serotype
GAS strains and the wild type and isogenic mutant pairs
were subsequently tested for biofilm formation, capsule
expression, survival in whole human blood, and adherence to keratinocytes.

Methods
Bacterial strains and culture conditions

M49 strain 591 is a skin isolate provided from R. Lütticken (Aachen, Germany). The M2, M6 and M18 serotypes GAS strains are clinical isolates obtained from the
collection of the Centre of Epidemiology and Microbiology, National Institute of Public Health, Prague, Czech
Republic, and have been previously described [22]. E.
coli DH5a was used as the host for plasmid constructions and was grown at 37°C with shaking in Luria
broth. The GAS strains were cultured in static ToddHewitt broth (THB, Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.5%
yeast extract (THY) at 37°C under a 5% CO 2 -20% O 2
atmosphere without agitation. Erythromycin in a final
concentration of 300 μg/ml for E. coli and 5 μg/ml for
GAS was used for selection and maintenance of the
mutants.
Standard DNA techniques

Genomic DNA from GAS strains was isolated by
DNeasy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen) according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations. Plasmid DNA manipulations, transformation of E. coli and GAS were performed as described previously [23]. S. pyogenes
competent cells were prepared in the presence of glycin,

Page 2 of 11

mutanolysin and hyaluronidase, as follows: S. pyogenes
was grown overnight in 10 ml THY broth supplemented
with 20 mM glycin, then 5 ml of the pre-culture was
added to 45 ml of THY supplemented with glycine (20
mM) and mutanolysin (10 U/ml) for overnight incubation. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000
rpm, 4°C for 5 min and washed once with sterile PBS.
Pelleted cells were suspended in 1 ml PBS containing
500 U hyaluronidase and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C.
The pellet was washed 2 times with ice cooled PBS and
2 times with ice cooled sterile sucrose (0.625 M). Subsequently, the pellet was resuspended in 1.5 ml sucrose
(0.625 M) and 100 μl were aliquoted in 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes. The competent cells were stored at -80°C.
RNA isolation

Total RNA from GAS strains was isolated from 25 ml of
culture at the mid-exponential phase of growth by the
usage of FastRNA Pro Kit (MP Biomedicals). In brief,
the bacterial pellet was resuspended in 1 ml RNApro
solution, transferred to a lysing matrix tube and processed through a Hybaid RiboLyser instrument for 40
seconds at setting of 6.0. After centrifugation, the lysate
was subjected to chloroform extraction. The upper
phase was mixed with absolute ethanol and incubated at
-20°C for 2 hours. After washing with 70% ethanol, the
RNA pellet was dried and resuspended in DEPC-H2O.
First-strand cDNA synthesis and reverse transcription PCR
(RT-PCR)

DNAse digestion of the obtained RNA was carried out
with RNeasy-Free DNase Set (Qiagen). After DNase
treatment, 5 μg of total RNA was used for first-strand
cDNA synthesis with SuperScript™ II reverse transcriptase using random primers (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. For the RT-PCR analysis
two pairs of primers were used binding to covR and
covS, correspondently. A fragment with size of 625 bp
appears when using primers binding to covR, CovR_for
(5’-CTCTTGAGCTGCAACATGAGG-3’) and CovR_rev
(5’-CACGAATAACGTATCCCATGC-3’). A PCR
employing primers binding to covS, CovS_for (5ATCATCTCCTGGCTTGCATGG-3’) and CovS_rev2
(5’-CCAGTCACTGAAAGGTTAATCGC-3’), results in
a product with a size of 846 bp. As controls genomic
DNA and total RNA were used as template for the PCR
analysis with both primer pairs.
Construction of recombinant vectors and GAS mutants

Using S. pyogenes M49 chromosomal DNA as a template, a 1023 bp internal fragment of covRS, spanning
663 bp from the covR gene and 355 bp from covS gene,
was amplified by PCR employing primers Csrko_for_HindIII (5’-GGCGGCAAGCTTGAAGATGAAAAGAATCTGG-3’)
and
Csrko_rev_BamHI
(5’GGCGGCGGATCCAGACATAAATATCTTGATTCG3’). The internal fragment was digested by HindIII and

BamHI and subsequently cloned into pUCerm [24] to
obtain a plasmid designated pUCerm::covS. For electroporation, thawed electrocompetent cells (100 μl) were
initially mixed on ice with 10 μl pUCerm::covS. The
mixture was next transferred to a pre-chilled 2 mm
electrode spacing cuvette (Bio-Rad). Electroporation was
then performed using a Gene Pulser II electroporator
(Bio-Rad) with the following settings: voltage 1750 V,
capacitance 25 μF, 12 ms, 481Ω. Subsequently, 1 ml
pre-warmed Todd-Hewitt broth (Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.5% yeast extract and 0.125 M sucrose was
added to the transformed cells, and the suspension was
incubated at 37°C for 2 h. Transformants were selected
on THB agar plates supplemented with 0.5% yeast
extract and 5 μg/ml erythromycin. Successful integration

of the plasmid was confirmed by PCR analysis of junction fragments using standard protocols (for the used
primer locations please refer to fig. 1 and the result section). The generated insertional mutant strains were
designated M18::covS, M18_588::covS, M49::covS,
M49_581::covS, M49_634::covS, M2::covS, M2_583::covS,

keratinocyte cell line [25], obtained from German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany. The adherence assay was performed as described previously [26].
In brief, all GAS strains were grown in THB supplemented with 0.5% yeast extract at 37°C under a 5% CO 2
-20% O 2 atmosphere. After overnight incubation the
bacterial cells were suspended in modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and added
to 3.5 × 10 5 per ml HaCaT cells grown overnight to
confluence. After 2 h, the eukaryotic cells were washed
with PBS and subsequently detached by adding 200 μl
0.25% trypsin/0.5 mM EDTA for 10 min at 37°C. To
quantify bound bacteria, the cells were lysed with distilled water and the number of bacteria in the lysate was
assessed by viable counts.
Biofilm assays

Biofilm phenotype formation was studied under static
conditions using uncoated or fibronectin-coated (for
M49, M2, M6 serotype strains) and collagen I-coated
(for M18 serotype) polystyrene well plates. BHI (brain
heart infusion), supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) glucose
was used for all biofilm experiments. This medium was
shown to best support primary GAS adherence and biofilm formation in a previous study from our lab [17].
For quantitative measurements, safranin staining was
performed as previously described [17]. For the SEM
studies biofilms were grown on coverslips coated with
human collagen I (Biomol) and further processed as
described by Lembke et al. [17].
Capsular hyaluronic acid measurements

The amount of cell-associated hyaluronic acid produced
by each GAS strain was determined by releasing capsule
from exponential-phase GAS cells grown in THY and
measuring the hyaluronic acid content of the cell
extracts using 1-ethyl-2-[3-(1-ethylnaphtho[1,2-d]thiazolin-2-ylidene)-2-methylpropenyl]naphtho[1,2-d]thiazolium bromide (Stains-all, Sigma) as described previously
[27]. Absorbance values were compared with a standard
curve generated using known concentration of hyaluronic acid from Streptococcus equi and the amount of hyaluronic acid capsule produced from the tested strains
was expressed as femtograms (fg) per colony-forming
unit (CFU).
Blood survival assay

The blood survival assay was carried out as described by
Nakata et al. [21]. Briefly, wild type and CovS mutant
strains were grown to exponential growth phase. The
bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and set to an
optical density at 600 nm of 0.25. This suspension was
further diluted 1:10000 in PBS. After determination of
CFU in the suspension, 20 μl of it was incubated
together with 480 μl of heparinized blood for 3 hours at
37°C with rotation. Finally, the remaining CFU were

determined and related to the initial inoculum, which
was set to 100%.
Statistical analysis

A statistical analysis for all functional tests was performed by two-tailed paired Student’s t test.

Results
Inactivation of CovS in GAS serotypes

CovS deficient mutants were constructed in different
GAS serotype strains by insertional mutagenesis. By this
technique, the covS gene is physically separated from its
promoter, thereby blocking transcription and thus
expression of the CovS protein. (Fig. 1). A plasmid
pUCerm::covS containing a HindIII-BamHI fragment
derived from covS and covR sequences from M49 strain
591 was used (Fig. 1A). Comparative sequence analysis
of the full genome sequenced serotypes, carried out in
order to evaluate the degree of homology between
covRS sequences among different GAS serotypes,
revealed that covRS is highly conserved in GAS. By
means of the BLASTN program http://blast.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/Blast.cgi, the identity rate between the nucleotide sequences of CovRS from various GAS serotypes
was determined to be at least 99%. Therefore, the construct containing an internal part of the covRS nucleotide sequence derived from M49 serotype genome was
used for insertional inactivation of covS in multiple serotypes. The resulting erythromycin resistant strains were
analyzed by conventional PCR for verification of the
inactivation of covS. As shown in Fig. 1B, the conventional PCR was performed with primer pairs 1/2, 1/3,
and 4/2 and products with the expected fragment sizes
were received (data not shown). As expected, primer
combinations 1/3 and 4/2 did not give any fragments
using WT chromosomal DNA as template (data not
shown). Furthermore, to assure that transcription of
covS does not occur in the inactivated strains, RT-PCR
analyses were carried out. As shown in Fig. 1C, when
using primers derived from covR and cDNA as a template, both the wild type M49 strain and its correspondent mutant strain gave a band of 625 bp. However,
PCR employing primers from covS, showed a signal with
a size of 846 bp only when cDNA isolated from the
M49 wild type, but not from the M49::covS mutant
strain was used.
To exclude the possibility of general growth defects in
the mutants under the experimental conditions tested
we performed regular batch cultures and monitored the
growth by optical density readings at OD 600 nm in
hourly intervals. Exemplary results for one WT/mutant
pair from each serotype are shown in additional file 1.
No general growth defects were observed for growth in
THY and BHI (additional file 1).

Contribution of CovS to biofim formation

Apart from primary adherence to eukaryotic cells, it is
now evident that GAS can form biofilms on matrix protein-coated and uncoated surfaces [17]. Our previous
work investigating the contribution of different TCSs to
biofilm phenotype formation suggested CovRS to be
involved in biofilm formation in GAS (unpublished
observations). Work from Cho and Caparon has also suggested that CovRS activity is required for biofilm formation [18]. Thus, we performed extensive biofilm studies
with wild type strains from different serotype strains and
their correspondent CovS mutant strains.
Previously, Lembke et al. showed that GAS serotypes
preferentially adhered to human matrix-protein-coated
surfaces. For instance, collagen type I was described as the
matrix protein supporting to the highest extent the primary adhesion of M18 GAS serotype. Fibronectin coating
was reported to induce biofilm formation in M2 and M6
and even in the biofilm-negative serotype M49 [17]. Based
on these observations, collagen type I or fibronectin was
used as a coating protein when M18 or M49, M2 and M6
biofilm phenotypes were studied, respectively.
As shown in Fig. 2A the inactivation of CovS sensor
kinase expression in the M18 serotype led to biofilm
defective mutants. This observation was further confirmed
by SEM analysis (Fig. 2B). A similar phenotype of biofilm
defectiveness was observed for the other CovS mutant
GAS serotype strains irrespective of using none-coated or
fibronectin-coated polystyrene surfaces (Fig. 3). Inactivation of CovS expression in the M49 serotype background
resulted in a biofilm-negative phenotype (Fig. 3A). Even
when human fibronectin was used as a matrix protein surface coating, the CovS M49 mutant strain was still defective in biofilm production. Likewise, the M2::covS,
M2_583::covS and M18_588::covS mutant strains were
attenuated in their biofilm-forming capacity in contrast to
the corresponding parental strains (Fig. 3B and 3C).
Since it was previously shown that the CovRS sytem is
a negative regulator of hyaluronic acid capsule synthesis
[5] and because of the fact that the capsule is involved
in biofilm formation or maturation [18], it was unexpected that inactivation of CovS in this study prevented
the biofilm production. However, our results clearly
demonstrated that the CovS mutants in the M18, M49
and M2 serotype are defective in biofilm formation in
comparison to the respective wild type strains.
Of note, for two out of the four M6 serotype strains
used in our study, the ability of the CovS mutant to
form biofilm exceeded that of the wild type M6 strain.
As shown in Fig. 3D the strains M6_576::covS and M6::
covS showed an increased biofilm phenotype. In contrast, the inactivated CovS strains M6_586::covS and
M6_796::covS displayed a biofilm-deficient phenotype. In
addition, Cho and Caparon reported that inactivation of

CovRS in another S. pyogenes M6 resulted in a failure of
biofilm formation [18]. Therefore, our results could be
indicative of a strain-dependent CovS influence on the
GAS biofilm formation abilities in the M6 genetic
background.
Contribution of CovS to capsule formation in GAS

formation abilities of the generated CovS mutants correlates to capsule synthesis and to further evaluate the

formation were either non-coated (Ncp, no coating protein) or coated with fibronectin (Fn). Data reported represent the mean and standard

serotype-dependent contribution of CovS to capsule formation, a quantitative analysis of capsule expression was
performed. The GAS capsule is an important virulence
attribute, shown to be associated with enhanced resistance to phagocytic killing in vitro and with increase in
virulence [5]. The capsule is involved in attachment of
GAS to the hyaluronic-binding protein CD44 on pharyngeal epithelial cells [28]. Furthermore, capsular hyaluronic acid of GAS hampers their invasion into human
pharyngeal epithelial cells [29].

The capsule measurements revealed that the ability of
the tested strains to form capsule differs. M18 strains produced the highest amount of hyaluronic acid capsule
whereas the clinical isolate 591 M49 strain behaved as a
low capsule producing strain. However, as shown in Table
1, for all of the strains, the amount of capsule detected in
the correspondent CovS mutants was increased in comparison with the parental wild type strains. Even though
the extent of increment of capsule synthesis of CovS inactivated mutants differs among the tested strains, our

Sugareva et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:34
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/34

results suggest that repression of capsule synthesis is a
uniform feature of the CovS sensor kinase across GAS serotype borders. Furthermore, the capsule formation cannot
explain the divergent effect of CovS inactivation on biofilm
phenotype in different GAS strains as the capsular hyaluronic acid measurements revealed that the M6::covS
inactivated mutant overproduced capsule similarly to all
other tested serotypes (Table 1).
Contribution of CovS to adherence of GAS

We next tested the serotype-dependent contribution
of CovS to adherence to human keratinocytes (HaCaT
cell line [25]). Adherence abilities of the CovS
mutants in comparison with the corresponding wild
type serotype strains are shown in Fig. 4. The results
are presented as relative percentages, where the wild
type adherence was set to 100%. For all examined serotypes the inactivation of CovS led to a reduction in
the adhesion rate to human keratinocytes. The observation that highly encapsulated mutant CovS strains
are attenuated in keratinocyte attachment suggested
that the capsule might prevent the interaction of bacterial surface molecules with specific receptors on keratinocytes by blocking the function of different
adhesins through physical shielding. A similar finding
was made previously by Darmstadt and co-workers,
who reported that hyaluronic acid capsule impedes
the interaction of bacterial adhesins with the keratinocyte receptor [30]. The adherence of a mutant lacking
hyaluronic acid capsule (has mutants) was increased
13-fold [30]. Furthermore, Schrager and others
pointed out that acapsular GAS exhibit enhanced
adherence to human keratinocytes [28]. Therefore, we
assume that CovS inactivation in different serotype
GAS strains led to reduction in the adherence ability
of the mutant strains in comparison with the corresponding wild type strains, which might be explained
by the overexpressed capsule in the CovS defective
mutants. However, the CovS influence on keratinocyte
adherence among the tested GAS serotypes is apparently a uniform feature.

Contribution of CovS to survival of GAS in whole blood

GAS are known to be very well equipped for survival in
whole human blood by expression of a diverse armamentarium of virulence factors that interfere with primary host
defense mechanisms in the blood, in particular the complement system and phagocytosis [17]. Increased capsule
expression leads to mucoid strains that are very often
more virulent compared to unencapsulated strains [31]
and have an increased resistance to phagocytic killing [1].
Thus, exponential-phase wild type and CovS mutant
strains were tested for survival in whole human blood. As
shown in Fig. 5, mutation of CovS in GAS serotypes M2,
M6 and M18 leads to a significantly reduced ability of the
strains to survive and multiply in blood. This finding was
unexpected since the increase in capsule amounts should
allow for a better survival and multiplication. However,
many other GAS surface-associated and secreted virulence
factors have been described to act as defense against phagocytic killing [4,32] and some of them might be more
dominant in their protective effect compared to capsule.
At least for M18 it was shown that capsule may be responsible for phagocytosis resistance in serum, whereas survival
in blood to a larger extend relied on M protein expression
[33]. Lack of CovS protein expression had no effect on
blood survival of the GAS M49 serotype (Fig. 5) suggesting
that the influence of CovS on blood survival is not a uniform feature among different GAS serotypes.

Discussion
Lately, an increasing amount of data compile to a strong
argument for a strain-dependent transcriptional regulation in GAS. In addition, a comparison of the set of
genes regulated by CovRS in different Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B streptococci, GBS) strains revealed variations in their CovRS regulons. Thus, a strain-specific
manner of CovRS-mediated gene regulation in GBS was
reported [34].
In this study, we investigated the potential effect of
the sensor kinase CovS on virulence traits of different S.
pyogenes serotypes strains, in order to figure out if a serotype- or strain-dependent influence of CovS regulation
in GAS does occur in the genetic background of an
intact response regulator CovR.
Although CovRS has been described as a global regulatory system in GAS, our results clearly showed that
variations of the CovS effect on biofilm formation
appear and that strain-dependent diversity in the CovRS
regulons might exist also in GAS. Biofilm production
has been described recently as an important protective
mechanism of GAS associated with increased antibiotic
resistance [17]. Previously, Cho and Caparon [18]
showed that a M6 mutant lacking CovR failed to form
biofilms, which suggests that the CovRS TCS is required
for biofilm formation in GAS. Surprisingly, in contrast

corresponding parental strains. The data represent the mean values of three independently performed experiments. *, the significance level (p <
0.05) for differences between wild type and isogenic mutant strains was determined by two-tailed paired Student’s t test.

to the latter observation, our investigation showed that
the CovS inactivation in other M6 strains did not lead
to the same result. This statement implied that CovS
might be involved in a strain-dependent influence on
biofilm formation. Alternatively, since our mutant is
deficient of CovS, but not CovR, the observed contradiction could be indicative of divergent influence of the
response regulator CovR and histidine kinase CovS on
biofilm formation. Another explanation supported by a
previous study by Dalton and Scott suggested a direct
or indirect influence of CovS on CovR under mild stress

conditions [35]. Such stress conditions could have an
influence on S. pyogenes biofilm growth. Further experiments presented here on the biofilm production of different GAS serotypes strains showed that the CovS
influence on biofilm of GAS is a strain-dependent characteristic. This heterogeneity among different isolates
could be associated with adaptation to diverse host
environments. Similar findings of strain-specific differences between transcriptional regulatory networks in
GAS were made recently with the Nra regulator, which
controls the transcription of several key virulence factors

in GAS [20,36,37]. In contrast to the M49 strain, where
Nra acts as a negative regulator of pilus gene transcription, Nra functions as a positive regulator of pilus gene
transcription in an M53 strain [20].
As already mentioned the hyaluronic acid capsule is
an important virulence factor, required for resistance to
complement-mediated phagocytic killing and thus is
associated with enhanced virulence [1,27,38,39]. Previous investigations showed that acapsular mutant
strains of GAS were impaired in pharyngeal colonization
ability [38]. In contrary, highly encapsulated or mucoid
strains have been linked to acute rheumatic fever and
severe invasive infections [5]. Various studies on regulation of capsule expression revealed that the regulatory
protein Mga, shown to influence the expression of
diverse GAS pathogenicity factors, affects the hyaluronic
acid synthesis in GAS in a serotype- or strain- dependent mode. For instance, inactivation of Mga showed no
effect on capsule production in an M6, M18 and M49
strain, but it resulted in decreased has operon transcription in a M1 strain [5]. However, as our results showed,
the CovS- influenced depression of capsule formation in
GAS is a uniform feature among divergent GAS serotypes tested. Moreover, our results confirm previous
experiments from Bernish and van de Rijn (1999) who
showed that a non-polar inactivation of CovS in 3 unencapsulated strains rendered those strains highly mucoid
[40].
The ability of S. pyogenes to adhere to its eukaryotic
target cells is an essential factor both for causing disease
and for persisting in its human host [16]. Therefore, the
contribution of CovS to the adherence capacity of GAS
in a serotype-dependent manner was additionally investigated. The results clearly showed that irrespective of
their individual adherence abilities, the CovS inactivated
mutants were inhibited in their adherence to human
keratinocytes in comparison with the corresponding parental wild type strains. Together with the fact that the
hyaluronic acid masses of CovS mutant strains exceeded
those detected for the wild types, this could imply that
the increased capsule material in the mutants could
mask the exposure of important proteins involved in
cell attachment and thus inhibit the process of attachment. Alternatively, CovS could act on important bacterial host cell adhesins either direct or via its influence
on CovR.
Furthermore, the effect of depression in adherence
rate typical for the CovS- inactivated mutants was
observed in all the serotype tested, which suggests that
CovS influences the adherence of GAS in an unvarying
mode.
Of note, our data for the adherence capacity of CovSinactivated GAS mutants contrasts the observation
made for GBS, where a corresponding CovRS mutant

Page 9 of 11

exhibited increased adherence to epithelial cells [41,42].
Apparently, although the proteins of the CovRS signaling system are quite conserved among these two phylogenetically related species, the influence of CovS to the
adhesive abilities of these two bacterial pathogens is
strikingly different. However, this is not surprising, as
similar heterogeneity in the transcription regulation
might exist even among different strains within the
same species.
Finally, CovRS has been reported to obviously
respond to so far unknown molecular signals in
human blood. Analysis of GAS global transcription
during ex vivo culture in human whole blood revealed
that CovRS is involved in GAS adaptation allowing
growth in blood [13]. We observed that covS insertional mutants in the M6, M2 and M18 background
were significantly attenuated in their efficiency to multiply in whole human blood, suggesting a high importance of the sensor kinase activity for blood survival.
However, this cannot be postulated for M49 591,
which is a skin isolate. Moreover, since the adaptation
in human blood is associated mainly with pathogenesis
during invasive growth, the involvement of CovS to
the response to human blood exposure is not a uniform characteristic among different GAS serotype
strains.
Most recently, a paper published during the review
process of this work by Trevino and colleagues uncovered that CovR retains some regulatory activity in the
absence of a functional CovS sensor kinase and that
CovS mutants are hypervirulent in ex vivo and in vivo
models of invasive infection [14]. However, CovS
mutants were attenuated in their ability to survive in
human saliva, which could be one possible explanation
why no natural CovS mutants are transmitted from host
to host [14].

Conclusion
Taken together, no serotype-dependent contribution on
regulation of capsule expression and adherence to
human keratinocytes was observed. Interestingly, an
increased capsule expression in M2, M6 and M18 CovS
mutants did not lead to enhanced survival of the bacteria in whole human blood. In contrast, the effect of
CovS on biofilm formation depended on the examined
strain. This finding implies that the CovRS system has
divergent effects on similar target genes in different
strains. Thus, the CovRS system could differ with
respect to its repertoire of regulated genes in a straindependent manner. In summary, in addition to Nra, the
CovRS system is the second regulator in GAS with serotype- or even strain-dependent activity, further supporting the emerging scheme of divergent regulatory circuits
in GAS.
