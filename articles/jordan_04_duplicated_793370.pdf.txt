Abstract
Background: Gene duplication is an important mechanism that can lead to the emergence of new
functions during evolution. The impact of duplication on the mode of gene evolution has been the
subject of several theoretical and empirical comparative-genomic studies. It has been shown that,
shortly after the duplication, genes seem to experience a considerable relaxation of purifying
selection.
Results: Here we demonstrate two opposite effects of gene duplication on evolutionary rates.
Sequence comparisons between paralogs show that, in accord with previous observations, a
substantial acceleration in the evolution of paralogs occurs after duplication, presumably due to
relaxation of purifying selection. The effect of gene duplication on evolutionary rate was also
assessed by sequence comparison between orthologs that have paralogs (duplicates) and those that
do not (singletons). It is shown that, in eukaryotes, duplicates, on average, evolve significantly
slower than singletons. Eukaryotic ortholog evolutionary rates for duplicates are also negatively
correlated with the number of paralogs per gene and the strength of selection between paralogs.
A tally of annotated gene functions shows that duplicates tend to be enriched for proteins with
known functions, particularly those involved in signaling and related cellular processes; by contrast,
singletons include an over-abundance of poorly characterized proteins.
Conclusions: These results suggest that whether or not a gene duplicate is retained by selection
depends critically on the pre-existing functional utility of the protein encoded by the ancestral
singleton. Duplicates of genes of a higher biological import, which are subject to strong functional
constraints on the sequence, are retained relatively more often. Thus, the evolutionary trajectory
of duplicated genes appears to be determined by two opposing trends, namely, the post-duplication
rate acceleration and the generally slow evolutionary rate owing to the high level of functional
constraints.

Background
The importance of gene duplication in the evolution of
genetic novelty has long been recognized [1,2]. Because
gene duplication often precedes the functional diversification between duplicates, it has been predicted that evolu-

tionary rates should increase following duplication [3,4].
Indeed, studies on the evolutionary rates of duplicated
genes showed that acceleration tends to occur immediately following duplication [5,6]. These rate accelerations
may be due to either a relaxation of purifying selection on

one or both gene duplicates or to the action of positive
diversifying selection between the duplicates (or some
combination of both factors) [7,8]. However it is
achieved, the evolutionary rate acceleration appears to be
an important mechanism leading to functional diversification of duplicates [9,10]. The role of relaxed purifying
selection in functional diversification has been embodied
in the neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization
concepts whereby duplicates accumulate mutations that
either lead to the emergence of new functions or differentially inactivate subfunctions of the ancestral singleton,
while the remaining subfunction is maintained or even
enhanced [11-17]. Detailed studies of the effect of duplication on site-specific rates showed an increased proportion of changes in highly constrained sites, which seems
to be particularly well compatible with subfunctionalization [18].
Post-duplication evolutionary rate acceleration has been
revealed primarily through sequence comparisons
between duplicated genes. More recently, the availability
of complete genome sequences has allowed for an
approach to the study of the effects of gene duplication on
evolutionary rates that is qualitatively distinct from those
earlier studies. The comparative-genomic approach to the
study of gene duplication and evolution that is employed
here relies on the distinction between genes that are
related by orthology (divergence via speciation) and paralogy (divergence via duplication) [Fitch, 1970
#130;Fitch, 2000 #131;Sonnhammer, 2002 #128].
Genome-wide comparisons of proteins encoded in
sequenced genomes allow for the identification of
orthologs and paralogs [19,20]. Orthologous genes can
then be classified into those that have paralogs (duplicates) and those that do not have any (singletons).
Sequence comparisons between orthologs of these two
classes can be used to assess the relationship between gene
duplication and evolutionary rate [21-23]. For controlled
between-species comparisons, this approach has the
advantage of equalizing the time of divergence (at speciation) between the genes being compared, whereas the
comparison of paralogs themselves is complicated by the
fact that duplications that produced them occurred at different times. Using a combination of within and betweenspecies sequence comparisons, we address the questions
of how and to what extent gene duplication affects evolutionary rates. In particular, we address the possibility that,
due to the relaxation of purifying selection after gene
duplication [5,6], duplicated genes in general might
evolve faster than singletons. We compare amino acid
substitution levels (and nucleotide substitution levels for
human-mouse) between orthologous gene pairs classified
as duplicates or singletons from the following phylogenetically diverse set of species pairs: human-mouse, Drosophila-Anopheles,
Saccharomyces
cerevisiae-Candida

albicans, Escherichia coli-Yersinia pestis, Bacillus subtilis-B.
halodurans and Pyrococcus horikoshii-P. furiosis. We show
that, in spite of the acceleration of evolution that is typically observed after duplication, duplicates tend to evolve
more slowly than singletons.

Results and Discussion
Sequence substitution levels of orthologs and gene
duplication
Orthologous protein sequence pairs were identified for
human and mouse as described under Methods. Protein
sequences were aligned, and the resulting amino acid
sequence alignments were used to guide the alignment of
nucleotide coding sequences (CDSs). These alignments
were used to estimate sequence divergence levels (substitutions per site) for amino acids as well as for non-synonymous (dN) and synonymous (dS) CDS substitutions. For
pairs of human-mouse orthologs, within-genome
sequence comparisons were used to classify them as
duplicates or singletons, based on whether or not they
had detectable paralogs, and the average sequence divergence levels for these two classes of genes were compared.
The classification of orthologous pairs as duplicates and
singletons was done using three criteria: 1 – presence of
paralogs in the human genome alone, 2 – presence of paralogs in the mouse genome alone, and 3 – presence of paralogs in human or mouse. For all three classification
criteria, the average ortholog amino acid substitution levels for duplicates were substantially (and statistically
highly significantly) lower than those of singletons (Table
1 and Figure 1a).

It is a formal, albeit unlikely, possibility that these differences in sequence diversity between the duplicate and singleton classes are due to different mutation pressures. To
control for this possibility, the ratio of dN/dS was taken as
an approximate measure of selective constraint and compared between the duplicate and singleton classes. As with
the amino acid substitution levels, dN/dS is substantially
lower for duplicates than for singletons (Table 1 and Figure 1b). The dN/dS ratio is considered to be an indicator
of the mode and strength of the selection operating during
evolution of a gene [9,10]. Thus, the finding that, in comparisons between human and mouse orthologs, duplicates, on average, have lower dN/dS values than
singletons strongly suggests that the former are subject to
stronger purifying selection than the latter.
A formal possibility exists that the observed differences
between the evolutionary rates of duplicates and singletons were due solely to the presence of extremely rapidly
evolving gene pairs of potentially mis-identified orthologs
(Methods; Figure 5). To examine the possible contribution of this effect, all human-mouse gene pairs with dS >
2 standard deviations (sd) from the mean were removed

from consideration, and the differences in average substitution levels between duplicates and singletons were recalculated. This did not result in any appreciable differences from the original results (Figure 1) that were
obtained using a cut-off of 3 sd (for the 2 sd cut-off, the
amino acid gamma distance was 0.18 for duplicates and
0.29 for singletons, and the dN/dS ration was 0.14 for
duplicates and 0.20 for singletons).
It is also formally possible that the differences in the rates
of evolution between duplicates and singletons are due to
the difficulty in the detection of paralogs of rapidly evolving genes, which would result in erroneous classification
of such genes as singletons. To control for this potential
bias, dS between duplicate human genes and their most
closely related paralogs were determined. Duplicate genes
were then re-classified as singletons if dS for a pair of
human paralogs was greater than dS between each of the
respective genes and its mouse ortholog. Under this procedure, only recent paralogs were classified as duplicates.
The substitution rate differences between these duplicates
and the resulting set of "pseudo-singletons" were re-calculated. This procedure did not result in qualitative change
in the results; in fact, the magnitude of the difference
between duplicate and singleton amino acid substitution
rates slightly increased (from -0.11 in Figure 1a to -0.14).
Thus, the differences in the evolution rates between duplicates and singletons did not seem to be due to a detection
bias.
Orthologous protein sequence pairs were identified and
aligned for two more pairs of eukaryotes and for three
pairs of prokaryotes, all with complete genome sequences,
and the pairwise sequence alignments were used to determine amino acid substitution (evolutionary) levels for
duplicate versus singleton orthologs. For both additional
eukaryotic species pairs (insects and yeasts), the average

ortholog amino acid substitution levels for duplicates
were substantially (and statistically highly significantly)
lower than those for singletons (Table 1 and Figure 2).
The same qualitative pattern was seen for the prokaryotic
species comparisons, with the duplicate class showing
consistently lower average amino acid substitution rates
(Table 1 and Figure 2). However, the differences were far
less pronounced than in the case of eukaryotes, and in
only one case the average rate difference between duplicates and singletons was marginally statistically significant (Table 1).
A similar relationship between gene duplication and evolutionary diversity was observed when the amino acid
substitution levels between orthologs were considered
with respect to the number of detectable paralogs for a
given ortholog. For all three eukaryotic comparisons,
there are statistically significant negative correlations
between the number of amino acid substitutions per site
and the number of paralogs (Table 2); in other words,
proteins with more paralogs tend to evolve more slowly
between species than proteins with fewer paralogs. However, the magnitudes of these correlations are slight (Table
2). The effect was even less pronounced for the prokaryotic comparisons; while the correlations between the
sequence diversity levels and the number of paralogs were
all negative, the magnitudes of these correlations were
quite small and none of them was statistically significant
(Table 2).
More striking than the relationship between evolutionary
sequence diversity and the number of paralogs was the
correlation between the amino acid substitution levels
between orthologs and those between the most closely
related paralogs. For each orthologous pair with detectable paralogs, the amino acid distances between orthologs
were plotted against the distances between one of the

orthologs and its most closely related paralog. For all
three eukaryotic comparisons, there was a highly significant positive correlation between the two sequence divergence levels (Table 3). Thus, orthologs that evolve
relatively slowly between species tend to have more
closely related paralogs within genomes, and orthologs
that evolve more rapidly have less closely related paralogs.
The r2 values for these relationships were about an order
of magnitude greater than those for the comparisons
between sequence diversity and the number of paralogs
(compare Tables 2 and 3). As in the previous cases, the
relationship between ortholog and paralog amino acid

substitution levels is not nearly as strong for the prokaryotes as it is for eukaryotes (Table 2). Nevertheless, the connection between gene duplication and sequence
evolution of orthologs in prokaryotes is most evident in
this comparison, with two out of the three correlations
being statistically significant (Table 3).
Age of duplications and substitution levels
One advantage of the comparison of orthologs rather
than paralogs is that the time of divergence is the same,
namely, the time of speciation, for all analyzed orthologous pairs. Paralogous pairs, in contrast, will often have
diverged via duplication at different times. In the case of
orthologous proteins then, differences in substitution levels are primarily due to differences in the strength of
purifying selection, whereas the apparent differences in
substitution levels for paralogous protein pairs are
additionally affected by differences in the time of duplication. This distinction is relevant to the comparison of evolutionary rates between orthologs versus evolutionary
rates between closest paralogs [22]. As described above,
there is a strong positive correlation between these rates.
This correlation could indicate that proteins that are
strongly conserved between species are also strongly conserved within genomes, or it could mean that proteins
that are strongly conserved between species tend to have
more recent duplicates in the genome. In an attempt to
distinguish between these two explanations for the positive correlation between ortholog and paralog sequence
divergence, gene duplications were partitioned into
approximate isotemporal classes. For example, allagainst-all sequence comparisons were performed for
human, mouse and Fugu rubripes (Fugu), and the results

were used to partition duplications along three evolutionary classes (Figure 3a): 1 – duplications that occurred
along the human lineage (after the human – mouse divergence), 2 – duplications that occurred along the mammalian lineage (after the divergence between Fugu and the
human – mouse lineage), and 3 – relatively ancient duplications that occurred along the lineage that leads to all
three species (before their divergence). The same procedure was also used to partition duplications along three
yeast evolutionary lineages (Figure 3b).
Once this partitioning was complete, the ortholog versus
closest paralog amino acid substitution levels were analyzed independently for each of the three classes of duplicates. This procedure has the effect of normalizing (to a
degree) the time of duplication so that only proteins
encoded by genes that duplicated along the same evolutionary lineage are compared. When this was done, the
correlations between orthologs and paralog amino acid
substitution levels within each isotemporal class of duplicates became even stronger than those seen for the pooled
data (Table 4). This result strongly suggests that the same

functional constraints govern a gene's evolution after speciation and after duplication.
Acceleration versus deceleration of gene duplicate's
evolution
Both theoretical and empirical studies have previously
pointed to an acceleration of sequence substitution following gene duplication [5,6,11,12,17].

This is thought to be due to either a relaxation of purifying
selection or the action of positive, diversifying selection
(or perhaps both). For instance, when pairs of paralogs
were compared to pairs of orthologs that have similar levels of protein divergence, it was shown that the paralogs
had higher dN/dS values [6]. This was taken as evidence
for a relaxation of selection immediately after gene duplication. Consistent with this notion, two recent studies
have shown that members of duplicate pairs often evolve
at significantly different rates after duplication and that
the more rapidly evolving duplicates have elevated dN/dS
[7,8]. In light of these observations, it seems surprising
that we found strong evidence here that orthologs with
duplicates evolve more slowly than singletons. Indeed,

the evolutionary history of those orthologs that have
duplicates would seem to include a period of accelerated
evolution after gene duplication, whereas orthologs without duplicates are unlikely to have experienced such an
acceleration. Thus, everything else being equal, duplicates
would be expected to evolve faster than singletons.
To investigate this apparent contradiction, we identified
triplets of genes which included a single mouse gene and
a pair of human paralogs that evolved via a duplication
subsequent to the human-mouse divergence (Figure 4a).
The dN and dS values for the human paralogs in such gene
sets were compared to the average dN and dS values for
the mouse gene and each of its human co-orthologs.
Comparisons between the human paralogs showed significantly higher average dN/dS ratios (t-test, P < 5 × 10-5)
than the human-mouse ortholog comparisons (Figure
4b). This pattern holds across a series of increasingly
stringent cut-offs based on the level of dS between
paralogs (Figure 4b). The same pattern was also seen in a
reciprocal comparison, when levels of dN and dS for
human and mouse orthologs were compared to levels of
dN and dS for mouse paralogs (data not shown). For the
most closely related paralogs, the dN/dS ratio of paralogs
was ~3-fold greater than the dN/dS ratio for the same

paralogs and their single ortholog in another species (Figure 4b), which is remarkably close to the value determined previously with a different approach [6]. The
magnitude of the difference declined for more distant paralogs (Figure 4b), in accord with the notion that the acceleration of evolution occurs immediately after duplication
[5].
These observations suggest, consistent with previous findings, that paralogs do indeed experience a post-duplication period of accelerated evolution, which is apparently
due to the relaxation of purifying selection. These results
stand in stark contrast to the finding that orthologs with
duplicates are more evolutionarily conserved than
orthologs with no duplicates. It seems that there are two
countervailing forces at work on the sequence evolution
of duplicate genes: i) acceleration of substitution between
paralogs caused by relaxation of purifying selection after
duplication, and ii) relative reduction of substitution rate
for genes with duplicates compared to singletons, which is
predicated upon the stronger functional constraints affecting the former. The post-duplication acceleration has the
effect of mitigating the sequence divergence differences
between duplicates and singletons. This makes the differences in substitution levels that are observed between
these two classes of orthologs even more notable.
Functional distribution of duplicated genes

terized proteins among duplicates than expected. By
contrast, the set of singletons is enriched in poorly characterized proteins. Thus, duplicates that are retained and
conserved during evolution are enriched for proteins with
known functions, particularly proteins that function in
signaling and other cellular processes. Apparently at odds
with this general pattern is the fact that duplicates have
fewer information storage and processing proteins than
expected, while singletons have more than expected. This
could be due to the fact that many proteins involved in
translation, transcription and replication function as
multi-subunit complexes (e.g., the ribosome and RNA
polymerase holoenzyme) such that duplication of the
genes for individual subunits could lead to a dominant
negative effect that would be selected against [26].

theoretical arguments [5,6,11,12,17] suggest that the fate
of duplicated genes depends greatly on their functional
utility. Selection probably does continue to operate on the
products of gene duplication but only in cases when the
duplicates contribute substantially to organismic fitness.
In order to further assess the validity of this notion, functional distributions of orthologs with and without
duplicates were examined. The database of eukaryotic
orthologous groups of proteins [24,25] was used to classify eukaryotic proteins into four broad functional categories: 1 – information storage and processing, 2 – signaling
and other cellular processes (such as protein folding, degradation and trafficking), 3 – metabolism and 4 – poorly
characterized. These distributions were then compared for
the two classes of orthologs, those that possess duplicates
and those that do not (Table 5). The distributions of the
observed numbers of proteins in each category were compared using a χ2 test where the expected numbers were calculated based on the functional distribution for all
proteins. For all three eukaryotic comparisons, the functional distributions of the proteins in the two classes –
duplicates versus singletons – were shown to be
significantly different (Table 5). In almost all cases, the
difference was most pronounced for the poorly characterized functional category; there are far fewer poorly charac-

General discussion and conclusions
After the submission of the current work, we became
aware of a very recent, independent study that reached the
same major conclusion as we do here, namely that duplicate genes are, on average, more evolutionarily conserved
than singletons in eukaryotes [27]. The analytical
approach employed by Davis and Petrov was conceptually
similar to ours in that it involved the comparison of
ortholog substitution levels for genes designated as duplicates or singletons. However, an important difference
between the two studies is that the approach of Davis and
Petrov involved the characterization of genes as duplicates
or singletons in one pair of species, Caenorhabditis elegans
and S. cerevisiae, and the estimation of substitution levels
in another pair of species, D. melanogaster and A. gambiae.
This allowed for an estimate of substitution levels independent of the effects of gene duplication, whereas the
substitution levels analyzed here were affected by
duplication. We believe that it was important, as it is done
here, to demonstrate on the same dataset that evolution of
duplicated genes is shaped by the interplay of two opposing effects, the initial increase in substitution rate after
gene duplication, and generally lower evolutionary rate of
duplicates compared to singletons.

The results reported here point to two opposing trends in
the evolution of duplicate genes. For the analyzed eukaryotic species, there is a clear relationship between gene
duplication and the sequence divergence of orthologs:
duplicates tend to evolve more slowly, on average, than
singletons. Two recent studies reported conflicting observations on the relative rates of evolution of duplicates and
singletons. Yang, Gu, and Li performed a comparison of S.
cerevisiae-C. albicans orthologs with and without duplicates and found that the former, on average, evolved
slower than the latter, in a qualitative agreement with the
results described here [23]. In contrast, Nembaware and
coworkers analyzed the evolutionary rates of human paralogs with varying levels of divergence and found that, in

a Test

compares the observed (obs) numbers of proteins in each functional category for duplicates (dup) versus singletons (sing) with the expected
(exp) numbers that are calculated based on the relative frequencies of all proteins in each functional category b Functional classifications of proteins
were taken from the Clusters of Orthologous Groups database

human vs. mouse comparison, a particular class of paralogs with intermediate divergence evolved significantly
faster than singletons [22]. It remains unclear what caused
this difference in conclusions. However, the statistical significance and robustness of the lower level of substitutions in duplicates compared to singletons, which was
observed for all compared genome pairs (albeit to a much
lower extent in prokaryotes than in eukaryotes) in the
present study, strongly suggests that duplicates indeed
tend to evolve slower than singletons.
The finding that, on average, duplicates are more evolutionarily conserved than singletons is probably explained
by the fact that the duplicates that are retained by
selection are of greater functional utility than those that

are lost after gene duplication. Thus, the selective pressure
acting on the sequences of duplicated genes is, on average,
greater than that affecting the sequences of singletons. The
difference in the functional distributions between duplicated and non-duplicated genes is consistent with this
notion. Apparently, genes that encode proteins with
domains that are already widely employed in various cellular processes are more likely to contribute to the functional diversification of an organism via gene duplication
than are genes encoding proteins with more limited functional utility.
However, in accord with the previous findings [5,6], we
also demonstrate here a substantial acceleration of
sequence substitution immediately after gene duplication.

Thus, the observation that, when orthologs are
considered, duplicates tend to evolve more slowly than
singletons is somewhat paradoxical. If one or more members of a set of paralogous genes experience a period of
accelerated evolution, one might expect that, everything
else being equal, this would have the effect of elevating
the substitution levels between those genes and their
orthologs above those characteristic of singletons.
However, the results described here indicate that genes
with duplicates are "more equal" than singletons in that
the former, on average, are subject to more stringent
purifying selection than the latter, presumably due to the
relatively greater functional utility manifest in the
increased likelihood of duplication fixation.
The relationship between duplication and ortholog
sequence evolution also seems to be at odds with the fact
that a considerable number of essential proteins, e.g.,
components of the core machineries of translation and
transcription, do not have any paralogs but nevertheless
evolve slowly. In contrast, some large multigene families,
such as the immunoglobulins, encode proteins that
evolve rapidly [28,29]. It appears that these two classes of
proteins are exceptional: the former are subunits of stoichiometric complexes whose duplications is discourage
by selection due to the deleterious effects of imbalance
[26], whereas the former are adaptive linear specific
expansions of paralogous families evolving under positive
selection [30]. These well known exceptions to the general
pattern reported here seem to render the relationship
between gene duplication and ortholog substitution
levels, which are averages based on comparisons of thousands of proteins, even more striking

Conclusions
It is notable that, in the prokaryotic species analyzed here,
the relationship between duplication and ortholog

sequence diversity is much less compelling than it is in
eukaryotes. Overall, there does seem to be a similar pattern to that observed for eukaryotes, but it is far less striking and in many cases the comparisons made yield nonsignificant results. The causes of this difference remain
uncertain. Conceivably, it could reflect the greater role
that gene duplications appear to have in functional diversification of eukaryotes compared to prokaryotes and/or
the preferential duplication of fast-evolving genes
involved in adaptive reactions in prokaryotes [21].

Methods
Sequences
Complete sets of encoded proteins from whole genome
sequences were compared for six pairs of species (three
eukaryotic pairs and three prokaryotic pairs): Homo sapiens (human) – Mus musculus (mouse), Drosophila melanogaster – Anopheles gambiae, Saccharomyces cerevisiae –
Candida albicans, Escherichia coli – Yersinia pestis, Bacillus
subtilis – Bacillus halodurans &Pyrococcus horikoshii – Pyrococcus furiosis. All protein sequences are publicly available
and were taken from ftp sites on the world wide web
(Table 6). Coding nucleotide sequences that correspond
to the human and mouse protein sequences were taken
from the Genbank database [31,32] – using a series of Perl
scripts developed specifically for the task (these are available upon request) together with programs from the
SEALS software package [33].
Sequence analysis
For each pair of species considered, pairs of orthologous
proteins were identified as symmetrical best hits [19,34]
in all-against-all BLASTP searches [34]; between the
encoded proteins of each species in the pair. All BLASTP
searches were run with an expectation value (e-value) cutoff of 10-5. BLASTP searches and post-processing of the

results were performed using programs from the SEALS
package. The symmetrical best hit procedure may misidentify orthologs in some rare cases where there is an
ancient duplication (i.e. prior to the diversification of the
pair of species being considered) followed by the
differential loss of one of the resulting paralogs in each
lineage (Figure 5a). When this occurs, the symmetrical
best hits will actually represent paralogs that have artificially high levels of sequence diversity. To control for this
formal possibility in the human-mouse ortholog identification, a cut-off based on the distribution of dS for
human-mouse was employed (Figure 5b). Pairs of
orthologs with dS values more than three standard
deviations greater than the mean dS value were not considered. Implementation of this control does not result in
any qualitative difference in the results obtained.
Pairs of orthologous proteins were aligned using the ClustalW program [35] and their substitution (evolutionary)
levels were calculated using the gamma distance correction [36] with α = 2. Paralogous sequences were identified
by using each protein as a query in BLASTP searches, with
the same settings used for ortholog identification, against
the rest of the proteins encoded by its same genome. Coding nucleotide sequences were aligned to correspond (i.e.
the gaps were inserted in-frame) to the amino acid
sequence alignments of the proteins that they encode. The
synonymous (dS) and non-syonymous substitution (dN)
rates were calculated from these alignments using the NeiGojobori method [37] implemented in the PAML software package [38]. The lineage-specific expansions were
defined as described previously using an approach that
combines all-against-all BLASTP comparisons and within
species clustering of the results [30]. In this report, the
mammalian lineage specific expansions were defined
using human versus Fugu rupripes (Fugu) comparisons
and the human lineage specific expansions were defined
using human versus mouse plus Fugu comparisons
(Figure 3a). S. cerevisiae – C. albicans lineage specific
expansions were defined using S. cerevisiae versus
Schizosaccharomyces pombe comparisons and the S.
cerevisiae lineage specific expansions were defined using S.
cerevisiae versus C. albicans plus S. pombe comparisons
(Figure 3b). The database of Clusters of Orthologous
Eukaryotic proteins (KOGs) [39] was used for analysis of
the functional distribution of eukaryotic proteins [25].
