Abstract
Background: It is expected that genes that are expressed early in development and have a
complex expression pattern are under strong purifying selection and thus evolve slowly. Hox genes
fulfill these criteria and thus, should have a low evolutionary rate. However, some observations
point to a completely different scenario. Hox genes are usually highly conserved inside the
homeobox, but very variable outside it.
Results: We have measured the rates of nucleotide divergence and indel fixation of three Hox
genes, labial (lab), proboscipedia (pb) and abdominal-A (abd-A), and compared them with those of
three genes derived by duplication from Hox3, bicoid (bcd), zerknüllt (zen) and zerknüllt-related
(zen2), and 15 non-Hox genes in sets of orthologous sequences of three species of the genus
Drosophila. These rates were compared to test the hypothesis that Hox genes evolve slowly. Our
results show that the evolutionary rate of Hox genes is higher than that of non-Hox genes when
both amino acid differences and indels are taken into account: 43.39% of the amino acid sequence
is altered in Hox genes, versus 30.97% in non-Hox genes and 64.73% in Hox-derived genes.
Microsatellites scattered along the coding sequence of Hox genes explain partially, but not fully,
their fast sequence evolution.
Conclusion: These results show that Hox genes have a higher evolutionary dynamics than other
developmental genes, and emphasize the need to take into account indels in addition to nucleotide
substitutions in order to accurately estimate evolutionary rates.

Background
Hox genes are homeobox containing genes involved in the
specification of regional identities along the anteroposterior body axis and, thus, play a fundamental role in animal development [1]. They encode transcription factors
that regulate the expression of other genes downstream in
the regulatory cascade of development and have been
found in all metazoans, including flies, worms, tunicates,

lampreys, fish and tetrapods. A particular feature of these
genes is that they are usually clustered together in complexes and arranged in the chromosome in the same order
as they are expressed along the anteroposterior body axis
of the embryo [2,3]. Ten genes arranged in a single complex comprised the ancestral Hox gene complex of arthropods (HOM-C) [4-6]. However, at least three different
HOM-C splits have occurred during the evolution of dipPage 1 of 15

tera [7-10], and several non-homeotic genes and other
genes derived from ancestral Hox genes are interspersed
among the Drosophila Hox genes.
The stability of Hox gene number and the conservation of
Hox ortholog sequences prompted the notion that Hox
proteins have not significantly diverged in function. However, it is now known that several arthropod Hox proteins
have changed in sequence and/or function, including
those encoded by Hox3 [11-13], fushi tarazu (ftz) [14],
Ultrabithorax (Ubx) [15] and Antennapedia (Antp) [16]. In
winged insects, including Drosophila, Hox3 and ftz lost
their homeotic function, that is, their ability to transform
the characteristics of one body part into those of another
body part [17,18], and their expression domains are no
longer arranged along the anteroposterior axis of the
embryo. Therefore, only eight Hox genes remain in these
species [6]. Hox3 gained a novel extraembryonic function,
and underwent two consecutive duplications that gave
rise to bicoid (bcd), zerknüllt (zen) and zerknüllt-related
(zen2). The first duplication took place in the cyclorrhaphan fly lineage and gave rise to zen and bcd [12,13].
Afterwards, but before the Drosophila radiation, zen went
through a second duplication that gave birth to zen2 [19].
Seemingly, bcd and zen have specialized and perform separate functions in the establishment of the embryo's body
plan: the maternal gene bcd codes for an important morphogen that establishes anteroposterior polarity [20] and
zen is a zygotic gene involved in dorsoventral differentiation [21]. zen2 has the same expression pattern of zen,
although its function is unknown. Despite its high
sequence divergence across species, it has been maintained for more than 60 Myr [19].
Hox proteins contain a highly conserved domain of 60
amino acids (coded by the homeobox) that binds DNA
through a 'helix-turn-helix' structure. This motif is very similar in terms of sequence and structure to that of many
DNA binding proteins. Functional comparisons of Hox
orthologs have largely focused on their highly conserved
homeodomain sequences and have demonstrated their
functional interchangeability between species [22-26].
Hox-derived genes, although having lost their homeotic
function, still retain the homeobox.
It has been shown that housekeeping genes, which are
expressed in all cells and at all times, are under strong
purifying selection and thus evolve slowly (e.g. histones,
or genes involved in the cell cycle) [27,28]. Hox genes, on
the contrary, are expressed early in development and have
a complex regulated expression pattern. Mutations in such
genes will on average have more deleterious fitness consequences than mutations occurring in genes expressed later
on, because they may have cascading consequences for
the later steps in development and thus may broadly alter

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/106

the adult phenotype [29-31]. Therefore, we also expect
Hox genes to be highly constrained and thus evolve
slowly. In fact, Davis, Brandman, and Petrov [29] found a
highly significant relationship between the developmental timing of gene expression and their nonsynonymous
evolutionary rate: genes expressed early in development
are likely to have a slower rate of evolution at the protein
level than those expressed later. Surprisingly, the strongest
negative relationship between expression and evolutionary rate occurred only after the main burst of expression of
segment polarity and Hox genes in embryonic development, so these genes could be evolving differently from
other developmental genes. However, only one segment
polarity gene, wingless (wg), and two Hox genes, Antp and
abdominal-A (abd-A), were analyzed.
Furthermore, Marais et al. [32] found a negative correlation between evolutionary rate at the protein level (as
measured by the number of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site, dN) and intron size in Drosophila, likely due to a higher abundance of cis-regulatory
elements in introns (especially first introns) in genes
under strong selective constraints. We know from a previous study that the Hox genes used in this study contain a
long intron replete with regulatory elements [19]. Therefore, we would expect these genes to be strongly constrained.
However, other studies seem to point to a completely different scenario. Developmental biologists noticed a long
time ago that a large portion of the sequence of Hox proteins diverges so fast that it is difficult to align homologues from different arthropod classes [33]. In fact,
nucleotide sequences outside the homeobox in labial (lab)
and Ubx have been reported to diverge significantly
[8,15]. These sequence differences may be neutral with
respect to protein function or, more intriguingly, they
could be involved in the functional divergence of Hox proteins and the evolutionary diversification of animals [15].
Moreover, Karlin and Burge [34] have shown that many
essential developmental genes, including Hox genes, contain long microsatellites within their coding sequence
(e.g. trinucleotide repeats that do not disrupt the open
reading frame). The vast majority of these genes function
in development and/or transcription regulation, and are
expressed in the nervous system. Due to the particular
mutation mechanism acting on these repetitive sequences
by replication slippage [35,36], microsatellites are subject
to frequent insertions and deletions. Thus, these repetitive
sequences could be responsible for a higher than expected
evolutionary rate of Hox genes. However, and despite all
the previous contributions, no quantification of the rates
of nucleotide and indel evolution has been reported so far
for a set of Hox genes.

On the other hand, the origin by duplication and the
functional evolution of Hox-derived genes suggest that
they might be evolving fast at the sequence level as well.
Duplicated genes are known to undergo a period of accelerated evolution where: they may degenerate to a pseudogene (pseudogenization), each daughter gene may adopt
part of the functions of their parental gene (subfunctionalization), or they may acquire new functions (neofunctionalization) [37-40]. The only divergence estimate
reported in a Hox-derived gene was calculated between
two close species (D. melanogaster and D. simulans) in bcd
[41]. A recent study found an increased sequence polymorphism in bcd in comparison to zen, which was
ascribed to a relaxation of selective constraint on this
maternal gene resulting from sex-limited expression [42].
Therefore, bcd is expected to evolve faster than zen under
this model. The evolutionary rates of zen and zen2, however, have not been reported so far.
We have measured the rates of nucleotide substitution
and indel fixation of three Hox genes, lab, proboscipedia
(pb) and abd-A, and compared them with those of bcd, zen
and zen2, which were derived by duplication from Hox3,
and a sample of 15 non-Hox genes, in the genus Drosophila. These rates were compared to test the hypothesis
that Hox genes, similar to other genes with complex
expression patterns and that are essential in the early
development, evolve slowly. We have also evaluated the
contribution of the homeobox and the repetitive regions
within Hox and Hox-derived genes to the evolutionary
rates.
The sequences compared comprise all the complete genes
available in D. buzzatii (representative of the Drosophila
subgenus), and their orthologs in D. melanogaster and D.
pseudoobscura (both species in the Sophophora subgenus).
D. buzzatii belongs to the repleta species group, a group
comprising ~100 species that has been widely used as a
model in studies of genome evolution, ecological adaptation and speciation. Negre et al. [19] have recently compared the genomic organization of the HOM-C complex
in D. buzzatii to that of D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura, and studied the functional consequences of two
HOM-C splits present in this species. When our study
began, this was the largest set of orthologous Hox genes in
species from both subgenera of the Drosophila genus, and
this allowed the exploration of evolutionary rates
throughout the Drosophila phylogeny. Due to the high
divergence of Hox genes [8], the inclusion of more distant
species outside the Drosophila genus (such as mosquito or
honeybee) would probably not be appropriate for the
estimation of genetic distances. Moreover, these species
do not contain the Hox-derived genes studied here.

Results
Nucleotide evolution of Hox, Hox-derived and non-Hox
genes
Nucleotide substitution parameters were calculated for
the coding nucleotide alignments independently for each
gene [see Additional file 1]. We then tested for differences
between the three groups of genes (Hox, Hox-derived and
non-Hox) (top section of Table 1) [see Additional file 2].
Our results showed that Hox-derived genes are evolving
much faster and with less functional constraint than Hox
and non-Hox genes. Differences among the three groups
are significant for the number of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site, dN (P = 0.022), and the
level of functional constraint, ω (P = 0.000) (see Methods). The gene zen2 is the main gene responsible for the
high values of nucleotide substitutions (both synonymous and nonsynonymous) in its group [see Additional
file 1]. On the contrary, Hox and non-Hox genes have a
similar number of nucleotide substitutions, t (P > 0.1).
However the level of functional constraint is even higher
(lower ω) in non-Hox genes than in Hox genes (ω =
0.04156 versus ω = 0.06094, respectively), although differences are only marginally significant (P = 0.063).
Therefore, Hox genes do not seem to be evolving more
slowly than other non-homeotic genes, despite their
essential function in early development.

Then, we plotted dN and ω in sliding windows along the
coding sequences of Hox and Hox-derived genes to see
whether or not these parameters behave homogeneously
along the sequence. Figure 1 shows that, in all genes
except zen2, there is a substantial decrease of both dN and
ω near the homeobox. zen2 contains a rapidly evolving
homeobox with high ω values. Contrarily, we have
observed that peaks of dN tend to lie within repetitive
regions (data not shown).
To control for a possible effect on the overall nucleotide
evolution of both the homeobox and the repetitive
regions (see Methods) of these Hox and Hox-derived
genes, we tested again for differences among the three
groups of genes excluding these regions. Removing the
homeobox in Hox and Hox-derived coding sequences (second section of Table 1) elevated the number of nucleotide
substitutions in these two groups, and decreased further
their level of functional constraint. Again, differences
among groups were significant for dN (P = 0.005) and ω (P
= 0.000), and the same tendency of the previous analysis
with complete coding sequences was observed. In contrast, removing repetitive regions (third section of Table
1) decreased the number of nucleotide substitutions,
especially in Hox genes, where all the genes in the group
contain this type of region. Therefore, the elimination of
repetitive regions slightly increases the difference between
Hox and non-Hox genes in terms of nucleotide substitu-

tions, and reduces the difference in functional constraint.
Once more, differences among groups were significant for
dN (P = 0.030) and ω (P = 0.001). Excluding both the
homeobox and the repetitive regions (bottom section of
Table 1) gave intermediate results. Therefore, we can conclude that: (1)Hox and non-Hox genes are evolving similarly in terms of nucleotide substitutions, (2) Hox-derived
genes are evolving much faster and with less functional
constraint than the other two groups of genes, and (3) neither the homeobox nor the repetitive regions alter the estimates significantly, and thus are not entirely responsible
for the two previous conclusions.
An excess of nonsynonymous over synonymous substitutions is a robust indicator of positive selection at the
molecular level. Therefore, we searched for values of nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratio (dN/dS = ω) greater
than 1 to investigate whether Darwinian selection has
been acting on any of the coding sequences analyzed in
this study. However, no evidence of positive selection in
any coding sequence or region of it was found.
Amino acid and structural changes at the protein level
We used the protein alignments to calculate the proportion of amino acid differences and indels. In the first case
(Table 2, Figure 2), differences among the three groups –

Hox, Hox-derived and non-Hox – were not significant (P =
0.101). However, the proportion of amino acid differences was substantially higher for Hox-derived genes
(40.43%) than for Hox and non-Hox genes (22.80% and
23.77%, respectively). This result is in full agreement with
our previous estimates of dN (Table 1), which showed
high values of this parameter for Hox-derived genes, but
very similar values for Hox and non-Hox genes.
Second, we analyzed the proportion of indels in the alignments (Table 3, Figure 2). In this case, differences among
the three groups of genes were highly significant (P =
0.000). Surprisingly, differences were due to the low indel
proportion in non-Hox genes (8.73%) compared to the
high values for Hox and Hox-derived genes (25.77% and
37.53%, respectively). Furthermore, we tested for differences in indel length using a nested ANOVA. The results
indicated that, although the variation in indel length
between genes within groups is significant (P = 0.021),
the difference between groups is even more significant (P
= 0.001). Mean indel length for Hox, Hox-derived and
non-Hox genes is 4.22, 5.99 and 3.55 amino acids, respectively. Non-Hox genes not only have on average shorter
indels, but also their longest indel is only 23 amino acids,
in comparison with 43 and 40 amino acids for Hox and
Hox-derived genes, respectively. In all groups, the indel

length distribution follows a negative exponential curve:
short indels are common and their abundance declines as
length increases (data not shown).

Finally, we tested whether the proportions of amino acid
differences and indels are correlated. The Pearson correlation indicated that these two variables are positively but
not significantly correlated (rPearson = 0.307, P = 0.175).

Proportion
Proportion of amino acid differences and indels in the set of genes analyzed in this study.
Therefore, genes with a high proportion of indels do not
necessarily have a high proportion of amino acid substitutions. This probably points to different causal mechanisms for amino acid substitutions and indels.
Effect of long repetitive tracks in the percentages of amino
acid differences and indels of Hox and Hox-derived
proteins
Most Hox and Hox-derived proteins contain large repetitive regions present throughout the protein except the
region near the homeobox and other highly conserved
regions (see for instance the amino acid sequence of ABDA in Figure 3). Predominant repetitions are polyglutamine (poly-Q), poly-alanine (poly-A) and serinerich regions (S-rich). These repetitive regions seem to
include most of the indels and amino acid differences,
and therefore they might be responsible for the surprisingly high evolutionary rate of Hox and Hox-derived proteins.

To test this hypothesis, we repeated the analyses of amino
acid differences and indels inside and outside these repetitive regions (see Methods), and compared these two
kinds of sequences (repetitive and unique). In the case of
amino acid differences (Table 2), the percentage of
aligned, non-conserved amino acids is higher in repetitive

regions than in unique sequence in all the three groups.
The T-test for paired samples (unique versus repetitive) on
proteins having both types of regions showed significant
differences between unique and repetitive sequences (P =
0.001), the mean of repetitive sequences being more than
twice that for unique sequences (51.01% versus 23.19%,
respectively). Despite this higher percentage of amino
acid differences in repetitive than in unique sequence, the
three groups of genes behave in a similar manner in both
types of regions (note that the ranking is the same in both
unique and repetitive regions).
Finally, we wanted to determine whether or not repetitive
regions accumulate a larger number of indels than unique
sequence (Table 3). The results show that in all the three
groups, the percentage of indels in repetitive regions is
much higher than that in unique sequence. These differences are significant (P = 0.006) according to a T-test for
paired samples, giving an average value of 42.32% in
repetitive regions versus 15.53% in unique sequence. Nevertheless, the ANOVA computed after removing repetitive
regions remained highly significant (P = 0.003). Thus
repetitive regions are not entirely responsible for the high
percentage of indels in Hox and Hox-derived proteins.
Therefore, Hox and Hox-derived genes have a tendency to

constant across groups [see Additional file 2]. Another
possibility is that genes within a group may have correlated levels of synonymous codon bias. Given that genes
with higher codon bias tend to evolve more slowly
[28,43], codon bias may contribute to spurious differences in the rates of protein evolution among groups. We
have measured codon bias for each gene using the Effective Number of Codons, NC [44]. There are no significant
differences in the codon bias among groups, and the average NC value for non-Hox genes is the lowest among the
three groups (the highest codon bias) [see Additional files
1 and 2].

Discussion
Evolutionary rates of Hox genes
This study shows that Hox genes seem to be evolving differently from other essential genes expressed in early
development, with complex expression patterns or with
long introns rich in cis-regulatory elements. Both the
number of nonsynonymous substitutions and the degree
of functional constraint are not significantly different
between Hox and non-Hox genes, and this remains true
even when the most peculiar regions (the homeobox and
the repetitive regions) are excluded (Table 1). Therefore,
Hox genes do not seem to be evolving more slowly than
other non-homeotic genes, despite their essential function in the early development and even though their interchangeability between species has been proven to be
functional in some cases [22-26].

Some Hox and Hox-derived genes considered here have
been included in previous studies [29,41]. Davis et al. [29]
showed that the strongest negative relationship between
expression profile and evolutionary rate occurs at a late
stage in embryonic development, soon after the main
burst of expression of segment polarity and Hox genes.
However, they also show that the most constrained transcription factors and signal transducers, the functional
class that contains many developmentally essential genes,
are expressed precisely at the same time as the segment
polarity and Hox genes. One of the two Hox genes
included in their study has also been analyzed here (abdA), and it is incidentally the gene with the lowest number
of nonsynonymous substitutions and the one that is most
constrained in our sample of Hox genes. On the other
hand, bcd, although being one of the first genes acting in
Drosophila development, was reported in the same study

Differences in the evolutionary rate among the three
groups of genes (Hox, Hox-derived and non-Hox) could be
mediated by some properties of genes that are correlated
with the number of nucleotide substitutions (t). One possibility is that Hox and Hox-derived genes experience similar background rates of mutation that are different from
those of non-Hox genes. We can use the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (dS) as a measure of the mutation rate of a gene. This variable is not
significantly different among the three groups of genes (P
= 0.530), and thus we can consider that mutation rate is

noncoding sequences within introns, or regulatory complexity [32]. In this respect, all Hox genes used in this
study contain a total intron size >10 Kb [see Additional
file 3], which corresponds to the longest intron size category used in [32]. Therefore, Hox genes are expected to
evolve slowly as they contain long intronic sequences.

Both Hox-derived and non-Hox genes contain shorter
intron lengths than Hox genes [see Additional file 3], and
thus would be expected to evolve faster.
Amino acid differences and indels
The percentages of amino acid differences and of indels in
Hox proteins also depart from the initial expectations.
While the percentage of amino acid differences is not significantly different among the three groups compared
(Table 2), the percentages of indels in Hox and Hoxderived proteins are much higher than that in non-Hox
proteins (Table 3). Therefore, Hox proteins are as diver-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:106

gent as non-Hox proteins in terms of amino acid changes,
but they are much more divergent in terms of indels. A visual inspection of the alignments pointed out a possible
explanation to these results (Figure 3). Hox and some Hoxderived proteins contain large repetitive regions, mostly
homopeptides, present all along the protein except the
region near the homeodomain and other highly conserved regions. It is within these repetitive regions where
most indels and amino acid differences seem to accumulate, in some cases resulting in poor alignment, and therefore they could be responsible for the surprisingly high
amino acid and indel evolution of Hox and Hox-derived
proteins.
Although repetitive regions have been shown to be richer
in amino acid differences and indels than unique
sequence, they do not fully explain the high variation
found in Hox and Hox-derived proteins. Even excluding
repetitive regions, Hox and Hox-derived genes contain
many more indels than non-Hox genes, although the percentage of amino acid substitutions is not significantly
different between Hox and non-Hox genes. Therefore, taking amino acid differences and indels altogether we can
state that the overall rate of evolution of Hox and Hoxderived genes is faster than that of non-Hox genes. The
percentage of the alignment that has changed is 43.39%
in Hox proteins, 64.73% in Hox-derived proteins and
30.97% in non-Hox proteins (the percentage of amino
acid differences has been recalculated before being added
to the percentage of indels to account for the total number
of sites, both gapped and non-gapped, in order to make
both percentages comparable). Finally, a lack of correlation between the proportion of indels and amino acid differences in the set of genes used in this study highlights
the different evolutionary mechanisms that regulate both
types of changes.
Homopeptides and other repetitions in Hox and Hoxderived proteins
Multiple long homopeptides are found in 7% of Drosophila proteins, most of which are essential developmental proteins expressed in the nervous system and involved
in transcriptional regulation [34,45]. What is the role of
these homopeptides? They could be tolerated, non-essential insertions that may play a role as transcriptional activity modulators. Some examples have been described in
Hox and Hox-derived proteins [15] that illustrate the
acquisition of new functions in the insect lineage while
maintaining their homeotic role. In these examples, selection against coding changes might have been relaxed
because of functional redundancy among Hox paralogs.
These sequence differences could be involved in the functional divergence of Hox proteins and the evolutionary
diversification of animals [15].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/106

The large effects of Hox genes on morphology suggest that
they regulate, directly or indirectly, a large number of
genes. It would be expected that such pleiotropic proteins
would be constrained in their sequence variation and,
hence, their contribution to morphological variation.
However, it has been shown that microsatellite sequences
in developmental genes are a source of variation in natural populations, affecting visible traits by expanding or
contracting at very high rates [46]. One intrinsic characteristic of microsatellites is their hypervariability, resulting
from a balance between slippage events and point mutations [35,36]. Their mutation rate has been estimated to
be 1.5 × 10-6 per locus per generation in the case of trinucleotide repeats in D. melanogaster [47], and is even greater
in the case of dinucleotides. These values contrast with the
general mutation rate of ~10-8 per site per generation of
base pair substitutions [48]. These repeats typically generate regions in the alignment with high variability in
sequence and length, and that are difficult to align.
A potential role for homopeptides is to serve as spacer elements between functional domains, to provide flexibility
to the three-dimensional conformation, and fine-tuning
domain orientation of the protein in its interactions with
DNA and other proteins. To that effect, changes in nucleotide distances between target binding sites might be
accompanied by complementary changes in the
sequences spacing the binding domains of transcription
factors (mostly homopeptides). This would produce a
coordinated evolution between transcription factors and
their target binding sites. Excessive expansions of
homopeptides, however, have often been associated with
disease in humans [49-52]. Amazingly, essential developmental proteins like homeotic proteins that apparently
need such homopeptides for their correct functioning
have to suffer the consequences of their quick and apparently unpredictable evolution, and sacrifice in this way
the conservation that would be expected in proteins of
this type.
Among non-Hox genes, the cluster of cuticular genes
(Ccp84Ac, Ccp84Ae, Ccp84Af and Ccp84Ag) behave similarly to Hox and Hox-derived genes and account for the
vast majority of indels in their group (Figure 2). These
short proteins share a conserved C-terminal section [53]
and include a 35–36 amino acid motif known as the R&R
consensus, present in many insect cuticle proteins, an
extended form of which has been shown to bind chitin
(chitin-bind 4; PF00379) [54]. Outside these conserved
domains, cuticular proteins share hydrophobic regions
dominated by tetrapeptide repeats (A-A-P-A/V), which are
presumed to be functionally important [55,56] and are
responsible for the high percentage of indels found in
these proteins. These repeats are usually complex repeats
that are not annotated in UniProt, nor detected as runs of

Page 9 of 15
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:106

identical amino acid repetitions (see Methods), and thus
contribute to the percentage of indels in unique sequence
in non-Hox genes (Table 3). When complex repeats were
annotated and considered as repetitive sequence (see
Methods), the percentage of indels in the unique portion
of all classes of genes decreased substantially, but especially in non-Hox genes [see Additional file 4]. The elimination of complex repeats in cuticular genes was crucial in
this reduction, and further increased the differences
among groups.
Therefore, our results show that long repetitive sequences
are not enough to explain all the differences found
between Hox or Hox-derived genes and non-Hox genes.
Hox and Hox-derived genes have a tendency to accumulate
indels outside these repetitive regions that is not observed
in non-Hox genes. We propose that spontaneous deletions
between short repeated sequences could be the mechanism responsible for this difference [57]. Such deletions
have been described in phages [58,59], Escherichia coli
[60-65] and humans [66,67], and predominate between
short sequence similarities of as few as 5–8 base pairs
[68]. Two different models can explain the generation of
spontaneous deletions: slipped mispairing during DNA
synthesis, and recombination events mediated by
enzymes that recognize these sequence similarities. In
either case, the repetitive and compositionally biased
nature of several regions within Hox and Hox-derived
sequences might explain the major incidence of indels in
these two groups. This would also explain the large differences in protein lengths among species that have been
observed in some Hox proteins [8]. This higher probability of mutation would presumably be accompanied by a
higher tolerance to indels of Hox and Hox-derived proteins outside their binding domains.
For a correct interpretation of our results, the set of nonHox genes should be an unbiased sample of genes, both in
terms of protein expression and structure. We have gathered this information from the literature, and verified that
our non-Hox sample comprises a variable group of genes
that are expressed through the fly life cycle (from young
embryo to adult) and contains a wide variety of protein
domains [see Additional file 5]. Therefore, we assume
that, although small, it represents an unbiased sample of
all non-Hox genes in the genome, and that results presented here are reliable.
The fate of Hox-derived genes after their origination by
duplication
The three Hox-derived genes used in this study (bcd, zen
and zen2) originated from two consecutive duplications
of the ancestral Hox3 gene. Seemingly, bcd and zen have
specialized and perform separate functions in the establishment of the embryo's body plan [11-13]. This is sup-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/106

ported by our data, as these two genes have a moderate
evolutionary rate but low level of functional constraint
(high dN/dS rate ratio). However, the finding of Barker et
al. [42] that genes with a maternal effect experience
relaxed selective constraint resulting from sex-limited
expression is not supported by our data. Our results show
that bcd and zen are evolving at very similar rates in the
Drosophila lineage, and bcd is even more constrained than
zen [see Additional file 1].
The function of zen2 is unclear. It has the same expression
pattern as zen and, despite its high divergence across species, it has been maintained for more than 60 Myr [19].
Conservation of two paralogous genes maintaining the
same function is unlikely, and could only be explained
under some peculiar conditions (e.g. two strongly
expressed genes whose products are in high demand
[40]). It could be that this gene is experiencing a process
of pseudogenization, supported by the fact that the evolutionary rate of zen2 is more than twice that of bcd and zen,
and that it has also the highest percentage of the alignment represented by indels. If so, we would expect to see
a relaxation of the functional constraint. However, the relatively high level of functional constraint of zen2 (ω =
0.09144) rather indicates a process of neofunctionalization, even though positive selection was not detected. The
fact that this gene does not show an explicit pattern of variation of ω along its sequence (Figure 1) further supports
the progressive loss of its original homeotic function and
the acquisition of new functions.
Compared to the other two groups (Hox and non-Hox
genes), Hox-derived genes are evolving significantly much
faster and with less functional constraint. It is also the
group with the highest proportion of amino acid differences and indels. These results reflect their relatively
recent origin by duplication, which was followed by
extensive changes in their role during the development of
insects.

Conclusion
Many studies so far have largely focused on Hox gene
homeobox sequences, and have demonstrated that they
are highly conserved across species. However, Hox genes
and in general all transcription factors share a particular
structure where different highly conserved modules are
interspersed with long repetitive regions, mostly microsatellites. Our results show that both Hox and Hox-derived
genes have an overall high rate of evolution, especially in
terms of indels. Moreover, although repetitive regions are
richer in both amino acid differences and indels than the
rest of the coding sequence, they do not seem to fully
explain the differences in evolutionary rates found
between Hox or Hox-derived genes and non-Hox genes.
Therefore, by using complete gene sequences rather than

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:106

their conserved modules, we observe that the Hox gene
evolutionary rate is as high as that of non-Hox genes in
terms of nucleotide evolution, and even higher in terms of
indels. Hox-derived genes constitute the group with the
highest evolutionary rate by all criteria. These results
emphasize the need to take into account indels in addition to nucleotide substitutions in order to estimate evolutionary rates accurately. This study is the first
quantification of the rates of nucleotide and indel evolution in these groups of genes, and shows that Hox and
Hox-derived genes have a higher evolutionary dynamics
than other developmental genes.

tested with one-way ANOVAs and pairwise contrast tests
[82], assuming homogeneity of variances for those variables that gave non-significant P values for the Levene test
[83] [see Additional file 2]. Orthologous coding
sequences in D. buzzatii, D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura were aligned according to their translation to protein
using RevTrans 1.3 Server [84] with some manual editing
using BIOEDIT v. 7.0.4.1 [79]. Two non-Hox genes of the
initial sample (CG1288 and CG17836) showed a doubtful
alignment, containing many gaps and few residue
matches, and thus were excluded from the analyses to
avoid unreliable estimates. A total of 15 non-Hox genes
were therefore used in this study.

Methods
Genes analyzed and their classification
All the completely sequenced genes in D. buzzatii with a
clear ortholog in D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura
(23) were included in our analysis: abd-A, lab, pb, bcd, zen,
zen2, Dbuz\Ccp3 (ortholog of Dmel\Ccp84Ac), Dbuz\Ccp6
(ortholog of Dmel\Ccp84Ae), Dbuz\Ccp7 (ortholog of
Dmel\Ccp84Af), Dbuz\Ccp8 (ortholog of Dmel\Ccp84Ag),
CG1288, CG14290, CG14609, CG14899, CG17836,
CG2520 and CG31363 from Negre et al. [19]; Adh-related
(Adhr) from Betran and Ashburner [69]; α-Esterase-2 (αEst2) and α-Esterase-3 (α-Est3) from Robin et al. [70];
CG13617 from Puig, Caceres, and Ruiz [71]; and Larval
serum protein 1 β (Lsp1β) and Lsp1γ from Gonzalez, Casals
and Ruiz [72]. Sequences of D. melanogaster orthologs
were collected from Flybase [73,74], and those of D. pseudoobscura were annotated on the scaffolds from the whole
genome shotgun sequencing project [75,76]. We identified the D. pseudoobscura orthologs by using the alignment
of this species with the D. melanogaster genome generated
by the Berkeley Genome Pipeline [77], and annotated the
target sequences with the aid of ARTEMIS v. 7 [78] and
BIOEDIT v. 7.0.4.1 [79]. A complete list of all genes, accession numbers (from Genbank or Flybase) and chromosomal locations is provided [see Additional file 3]. The
longest transcript of each gene was used for the analyses.
Genes were classified into three categories: 1) Hox genes
(abd-A, lab and pb); 2) Hox-derived genes (bcd, zen and
zen2); and 3) non-Hox genes (the remaining 17 genes).
Results in each group were produced by calculating the
average of all the genes within the group.
Sequence annotation and alignment
A set of Perl scripts, together with modules from PDA v.
1.4 [80] and BIOPERL v. 1.2.3 [81], were used to automatically check sequence annotations, extract the coding
sequences (CDSs) of the selected transcripts and calculate
basic gene structure and base composition parameters
(gene and protein lengths; codon bias measured by the
Effective Number of Codons (NC); and G+C content in
second, third and all codon positions) [see Additional file
1]. Differences among the three groups of genes were

Estimation of evolutionary rates
The numbers of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions per site (dS and dN, respectively) were estimated
on the nucleotide alignments of each gene using maximum likelihood methods with the program codeml of the
PAML v. 3.14 package [85] [see Additional file 1]. We used
an unrooted tree and the codon equilibrium frequencies
(πi) estimated from the nucleotide frequencies of the three
codon sites (F3X4 option of codeml). Differences among
the three groups of genes were tested using one-way ANOVAs and pairwise contrast tests as before. Furthermore, we
visualized differences along the genes by plotting dN and
ω in sliding windows of 240 nucleotides and a step size of
three nucleotides (one codon).
Measurement of amino acid differences and indels
We measured the proportion of amino acid differences
and indels in the protein alignments (translated from the
previous nucleotide alignments) using in-house Perl
scripts. The methodology was based on measuring the
number of non-conserved positions due to either amino
acid differences (point changes) or indels (structural
changes) in the protein multiple alignments (e.g. the minimum indel length is one amino acid, corresponding to
three nucleotides in the nucleotide sequence). We can
estimate in this way the percentage of the protein which
has been changed in our set of species. We think that this
is a simple (yet somewhat rough) measure to estimate the
degree of constraint relaxation of proteins.

Specifically, the number of amino acid differences was
computed as the number of non-gapped positions with
non-identical amino acids in the three species. All percentages are given in relation to the total number of
aligned amino acids (non-gapped positions). Similarly,
the number of indels was computed as the number of different indels (gaps affecting different positions) in the
complete alignment (gapped and non-gapped sites).
Therefore, an indel shared by two species was considered
a single indel, while overlapping gaps were considered
separately. Indel lengths were taken into account to calcu-

late the percentage of the alignment affected by indels. In
this case, all percentages are given in relation to the total
length of the alignment (gapped and non-gapped positions).
We used one-way ANOVAs to test for differences between
Hox, Hox-derived and non-Hox proteins in both parameters: the proportion of amino acid differences and the proportion of indels. We also used the Pearson correlation
coefficient to test for a correlation between the two measures (e.g. to test whether proteins with a high proportion
of amino acid differences also have a high proportion of
indels), and a nested ANOVA [82] to test for differences in
indel length among the three groups, taking into account
the variation within groups.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/106

We also calculated the proportion of amino acid differences and indels in repetitive and non-repetitive (unique)
sequence in the three groups, and tested for differences
between these two types of regions using a T-test for
paired samples [82] on those proteins having both types
of regions.

Authors' contributions
Contribution of the homeobox and the repetitive regions
to the evolutionary rates
In order to test the effect of the homeobox and the repetitive regions in our estimates of nucleotide substitutions,
we repeated the previous analyses excluding one or both
types of sequence. Repetitive regions were identified in
three different ways. First, we searched in the UniProt
Knowledgebase Release 8.6 (Swiss-Prot Release 50.6 +
TrEMBL Release 33.6) [86] for annotated compositionally
biased regions (defined in the feature table as COMPBIAS) in the protein sequences encoded by Hox, Hoxderived and non-Hox genes [see Additional file 3]. In the
case of Hox genes, all three genes in the group contained
at least one annotated repetitive region, while for Hoxderived and non-Hox genes only one entry of each group
(bcd and CG2520, respectively) contained annotated
repetitive regions. Note that only repeats in D. melanogaster are identified by using this methodology. Second,
we identified simple repeats as those runs of 5 or more
identical amino acids (e.g. QQQQQ), or at least 4 identical repetitions of 2 or more amino acids (e.g.
GVGVGVGV), in any of the three species. By using this
second approach, we extended the number of proteins
with repetitive sequences in both the Hox-derived and
non-Hox groups. Finally, we tried to visually annotate
complex repeats as those imperfect runs of amino acid
repetitions or compositionally biased regions in the protein (e.g. regions in the protein with a high content of Q,
S, A, P, H, G, V, etc.). Data was analyzed using a combination of the three approaches as follows: (1) using UniProt
only; (2) using UniProt + Simple repeats; and (3) using
UniProt + Simple repeats + Complex repeats. Because the
identification of complex repeats is somewhat subjective,
we present in the main text the results obtained by identifying repeats using the second combination (UniProt +
Simple repeats). However, results do not differ significantly among the three combinations [see Additional file
4].
