Abstract
Historically, Japanese Encephalitis virus (JEV) genotype III (GIII) has been responsible for human diseases. In recent
years, JEV genotype I (GI) has been isolated from mosquitoes collected in numerous countries, but has not been
isolated from patients with encephalitis. In this study, we report recovery of JEV GI live virus and identification of
JEV GI RNA from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of encephalitis patients in JE endemic areas of China. Whole-genome
sequencing and molecular phylogenetic analysis of the JEV isolate from the CSF samples was performed. The isolate in this study is highly similar to other JEV GI strains which isolated from mosquitoes at both the nucleotide
and deduced amino acid levels. Phylogenetic analysis based on the genomic sequence showed that the isolate
belongs to JEV GI, which is consistent with the phylogenetic analysis based on the pre-membrane (PrM) and Glycoprotein genes. As a conclusion, this is the first time to isolate JEV GI strain from CSF samples of encephalitis
patients, so continuous survey and evaluate the infectivity and pathogenecity of JEV GI strains are necessary, especially for the JEV GI strains from encephalitis patients. With respect to the latter, because all current JEV vaccines
(live and inactivated are derived from JEV GIII strains, future studies should be aimed at investigating and monitoring cross-protection of the human JEV GI isolates against widely used JEV vaccines.
Findings
Japanese encephalitis (JE) is one of the leading causes of
acute encephalopathy affecting children and adolescents
[1]. With the spread of JEV into new areas and the potential for further expansion, JE has become a worldwide public health problem [1-3]. Almost half of the human
population currently lives in countries where JEV occurs
and nearly 50,000 cases of JE occur worldwide and 15,000
of them die per year [1-3]. JEV, as the etiologic agent of
JE, has been subdivided into five genotypes [4]. The majority of JEV isolates from humans were genotype III as
reported previously [2-4]. Over the last two decades JEV
GI strains has been isolated from mosquitoes or swine collected in Southeast Asia, Australia, Korea, Japan and
China, etc. [4-9]. There are few JEV GI isolates from JE

patients, so there is no evidence showing that JEV GI associated with human encephalitis.
In this study, the acute (1-3 days after onset) serum and
CSF specimens of patients with a clinical diagnosis of JE
but negative for JEV-specific IgM antibody testing were
obtained for diagnosis purposes from JE surveillance
laboratories in Yunnan (250 cases), Guizhou (120 cases)
and Gansu (50 cases) provinces of China in 2006 and
2008. These specimens were stored at -80°C and transported on dry ice to Institute for Viral Disease Control
and Prevention (IVDCP), China CDC, for JEV serological
examination, JEV nucleic acid detection and virus isolation. First, the samples were re-screened to verify the
absence of JEV-specific IgM antibody using the JEV IgMCapture ELISA kit (Shanghai B & C Enterprise Development Co. Ltd, Shanghai, PR China) [10]. Of those which
did not contain detectable JEV IgM antibody were performed for viral RNA extraction directly by using the
QIAamp viral RNA extraction kit (QIAGEN, Valencia,
CA, USA) without risk of altering the genome by passage
in vitro. cDNA was synthesized using random hexmer

primer with Ready-To-Go You-Prime First-Strand Beads
(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscatawy, NJ, USA), and
a hemi-nested PCR procedure was used to amplify a 492bp fragment of the premembrane (PrM) gene of JEV by
using the Takara LA Taq PCR kit (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga,
Japan). The primers which covered all the JEV genotypes
were derived from Ishikawa strain genome sequences
[GenBank:AB051292]; PrMF: 5’-CGT TCT TCA AGT
TTA CAG CAT TAG C-3’ (251nt-275nt), PrMR1: 5’-CG
Y TTG GAA TGY CTR GTC CG-3’ (724nt-743nt), and
PrMR2: 5’-CCY RTG TTY CT G CCA AGC ATC CAM
CC-3’ (901nt-925nt). PCR products were purified with
the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen), and then
the purified products were sequenced with the BigDye1
Terminator v1.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems) on ABI 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic
analysis were done using ClustalX version 2.0 http://
www.clustal.org and MEGA version 4 http://www.megasoftware.net by the neighbor-joining method with bootstrap probabilities of 1,000 replicates. Totally five CSF
samples (Table 1) were tested positive by RT-PCR, and
none for the serum samples. The sequences [GenBank:
HM366548-HM366552] amplified from CSF samples are
clustered within GI (Figure 1) by phylogenetic analysis
based on the 240 nucleotide (nt) sequence of the JEV
prM gene. Aliquots of CSF samples which showed positive by RT-PCR were inoculated onto BHK-21 cells for
virus isolation. One isolate (GZ56) was obtained, which
was taken from a 0.5 years old female patient residing in
Guizhou province (Table 1). The complete genomic
sequence [GenBank:HM366552] of GZ56 strain was then
determined by RT-PCR and sequencing using flavivirusspecific primers [11] and overlapping primers designed
from the sequence of JEV strain Ishikawa. The genome
of GZ56 strain has identical size of 10,965 nt with a 96-nt
5’ nontranslated region (NTR) and a 570-nt 3’ NTR, and

has the same genomic structure with other JEV strains.
The single open reading frame (10, 296 nt) codes for a
polyprotein of 3, 432 amino acid (aa). Phylogenetic analysis based on the genomic sequence showed that GZ56
strain belongs to GI (Figure 1), which is consistent with
the phylogenetic analysis based on the PrM and E genes
(Figure 1). GZ56 strain showed high homology with JEV
GI strains obtained from swine of Japan (Mie/40) and
China (HEN0701) in nt (99.2% and 98.2% respectively)
and aa (99.8% and 99.5% respectively).
The five patients who showed JEV GI positive by
RT-PCR or virus isolation include both male and female
with age range from 0.5 to 37 years old (Table 1), and
resided in southwestern (Yunnan and Guizhou province)
and northwest areas (Gansu province) of China, within
latitude 24°37’~ 42°57’N and longitude 92°13 ‘~ 111°15’E.
These areas are known to be endemic for JE, and JEVs
have been isolated from mosquitoes collected in these
areas [12,13]. Molecular epidemiological study showed
that all of the JEV isolates obtained either from mosquitoes or from clinical samples of human beings before
1970 s were GIII in China [6,9,12,13]. JEV GI isolates was
first obtained from mosquitoes collected in China in
1977, thereafter JEV GI isolates from mosquitoes showed
gradually increasing frequency in China including Yunnan, Guizhou and Gansu provinces, which suggests that
JEV GI is replacing JEV GIII and is becoming the major
genotype in these areas in recent years [6,9,12,13]. In our
study, JEV GI strain was isolated for the first time from
CSF samples of JE patients in China. Previously, partial
sequences of JEV GI were detected in specimens of
meningitis patients in Japan [14] and in JE patients in an
outbreak of China in 2006 [10]. These results showed
that JEV GI associated with human encephalitis. JEV GI
isolates from the patients in this study are classified into
3 clusters (Figure 1), and closely related to the recently
identified JEV GI strains including JEV GI strains

Phylogenetic analyses based on the E gene of JEV; (C) Phylogenetic analyses based on the full-length genome of JEV. Phylogenetic analyses
were performed by the neighbor-joining method using MEGA version 4 http://www.megasoftware.net. Bootstrap probabilities of each node
were calculated with 1,000 replicates. The tree was rooted by using Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV) sequence as the out group virus.
Horizontal branch lengths are proportional to genetic distance and vertical branch lengths have no significance. The scale indicates the number
of nucleotide substitutions per site. Sequences from this study are in boldface. Viruses were identified by using the nomenclature of virus strain/
GenBank number/country/year of isolation/origin as showed in Figure 1(A).

identified during JE outbreak of Shanxi province of China
in 2006 [10]. One from northwest area was grouped
within cluster 3, the others from southwestern areas were
grouped in both cluster 1 and 2. The mechanism for JEV
GI spread into southwestern and northwest areas of
China needs further investigation.
In this study, all samples (CSF and serum) from five
cases were negative for JEV IgM antibody examined by
laboratories of local hospital, but based on clinical features, living area (in JE endemic region) of the patients,
and cases happened in the season of JE, the five cases
were still diagnosed as JE by the local clinicians. Further
investigation in our laboratory showed that CSF samples
of the patients were positive for JEV GI (Table 1),
which confirmed that the diagnosis of local clinicians is
correct. The data indicated that the diagnosis of GI JEV
infection using acute samples should perform RT-PCR
detection, especially for the acute samples which
showed absence of JEV IgM antibody to reduce misdiagnosis in JE endemic areas. As a conclusion, this
study is the first time to obtain JEV GI isolates from
encephalitis patients in China, continuous survey and

evaluate the infectivity and pathogenecity of JEV GI
strains, especially for the JEV GI strains from humans,
are necessary. In addition, because all current JEV vaccines (live and inactivated are derived from JEV GIII
strains [1-3], the investigation and monitor of cross-protection between the JEV GI strains and widely used JEV
GIII vaccines are needed.
