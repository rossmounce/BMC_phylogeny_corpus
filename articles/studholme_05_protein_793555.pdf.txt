Abstract
Background: Evolution of new complex biological behaviour tends to arise by novel combinations
of existing building blocks. The functional and evolutionary building blocks of the proteome are
protein domains, the function of a protein being dependent on its constituent domains. We
clustered completely-sequenced proteomes of prokaryotes on the basis of their protein domain
content, as defined by Pfam (release 16.0). This revealed that, although there was a correlation
between phylogeny and domain content, other factors also have an influence. This observation
motivated an investigation of the relationship between an organism's lifestyle and the complement
of domains and domain architectures found within its proteome.
Results: We took a census of all protein domains and domain combinations (architectures)
encoded in the completely-sequenced proteobacterial genomes. Nine protein domain families
were identified that are found in phylogenetically disparate plant-associated bacteria but are absent
from non-plant-associated bacteria. Most of these are known to play a role in the plant-associated
lifestyle, but they also included domain of unknown function DUF1427, which is found in plant
symbionts and pathogens of the alpha-, beta- and gamma-Proteobacteria, but not known in any
other organism. Further, several domains were identified as being restricted to phytobacteria and
Eukaryotes. One example is the RolB/RolC glucosidase family, which is found only in Agrobacterium
species and in plants. We identified the 0.5% of Pfam protein domain families that were most
significantly over-represented in the plant-associated Proteobacteria with respect to the
background frequencies in the whole set of available proteobacterial proteomes. These included
guanylate cyclase, domains implicated in aromatic catabolism, cellulase and several domains of
unknown function.
We identified 459 unique domain architectures found in phylogenetically diverse plant pathogens
and symbionts that were absent from non-pathogenic and non-symbiotic relatives. The vast
majority of these were restricted to a single species or several closely related species and so their
distributions could be better explained by phylogeny than by lifestyle. However, several
architectures were found in two or more very distantly related phytobacteria but absent from nonplant-associated bacteria. Many of the proteins with these unique architectures are predicted to be
secreted.

In Pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato, those genes encoding genes with novel domain
architectures tended to have atypical GC contents and were adjacent to insertion sequence
elements and phage-like sequences, suggesting acquisition by horizontal transfer.
Conclusions: By identifying domains and architectures unique to plant pathogens and symbionts,
we highlighted candidate proteins for involvement in plant-associated bacterial lifestyles. Given that
characterisation of novel gene products in vivo and in vitro is time-consuming and expensive, this
computational approach may be useful for reducing experimental search space. Furthermore we
discuss the biological significance of novel proteins highlighted by this study in the context of plantassociated lifestyles.

Background
The Proteobacteria comprise a phylum of Gram-negative
bacteria that includes an extraordinary diversity of lifestyles, ecology and metabolism. At one end of a spectrum
are free-living organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
which has a relatively large genome that encodes enormous regulatory and metabolic flexibility, allowing it to
colonise diverse niches. At the other extreme are highly
specialised intracellular symbionts (Buchnera species,
Rickettsia species), whose small genomes have undergone
reductive evolution and which lack many common metabolic and regulatory features. With the availability of complete genome sequences for many model plant-associated
bacteria, we are particularly interested in how genome
analyses can be used to gain insights into the mechanisms
and evolution of associations between bacteria and
plants.
There are complete annotated genome sequences available for several phylogenetically diverse proteobacterial
plant pathogens and symbionts, along with many of their
non-pathogenic and non-symbiotic relatives. For example, among the alpha-Proteobacteria, complete genome
sequences are available for the phytopathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens [1-3], the nitrogen-fixing symbionts
Bradyrhizobium japonicum [4], Mesorhizobium loti [5] and
Sinorhizobium meliloti [6,7], the non-pathogenic free-living
Caulobacter crescentus [8], and the animal pathogenic Rickettsia species [9-11]. Ralstonia solanacearum [12] is the sole
completely sequenced plant pathogen amongst the betaProteobacteria, a division that also includes animal pathogens in the genera Neisseria [13,14] and Bordetella [15]
and the free-living chemolithoautotroph Nitrosomonas
europaea [16] whose genomes have been sequenced.
Among the available complete genome sequences for the
gamma-Proteobacteria are those of the plant pathogens
Xylella fastidiosa [17,18], Xanthomonas campestris [19], Xanthomonas axonopodis [19] and Pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato [20] as well as P. aeruginosa [21], which is an
occasional pathogen of plants as well as animals.
Each of these three divisions of the Proteobacteria contains a wide variety of different lifestyles, so it is logical to

assume that bacteria-plant interactions have evolved independently in multiple separate Proteobacterial lineages.
Ultimately the differences between these lifestyles are
determined by the organisms' genes acting through their
expressed proteins and RNAs. Given the abundance of
complete genome sequence data now available, a high
priority is to understand which features of an organism's
proteome determine its lifestyle, and the evolutionary
processes underlying environmental adaptation and evolution of novel traits. Two main sources have been proposed for the evolution and acquisition of novel traits by
bacteria: (i) duplication, mutation and recombination of
existing genes within a single lineage, and (ii) lateral gene
transfer between lineages. A combination of both bioinformatic and experimental studies are needed to determine the relative importance of these two processes in the
evolution of plant-associated lifestyles in bacteria.
Evolution of new complex biological behaviours tends to
arise (but not exclusively) by novel combinations of existing building blocks. The functional and evolutionary
building blocks or units of the proteome are protein
domains. Protein domains can be classified into families;
examples of widely used classification schemes are those
of Pfam [23] and SMART [24]. We hypothesised that systematic identification of proteins having domain architectures that are exclusive to plant-associated bacteria would
identify good candidates for proteins with specific
involvement in plant-microbial interactions, or in a plantassociated lifestyle, and would also generate insight into
the distribution and evolution of novel traits in plantassociated bacteria.

Results and discussion
Hierarchical clustering of completely-sequenced
prokaryotic proteomes
To gain an overview of the similarities and differences
between their protein domain content, we classified representative prokaryotes into hierarchical clusters based on
their complement of protein domain families described.
For each proteome we generated a 7,677 binary state element vector where each element represented the presence
or absence of one of the 7,677 Pfam protein domain

families. Pairwise distances were calculated for each pair
of proteomes based on the level of similarity between the
pair of vectors, and tree was built by neighbour-joining
(see Methods for more details). One hundred trees were
built, each time leaving out 10 % of the vector elements,
selected at random. The tree shown in Figure 1 represents
the consensus of these 100 jacknife trials.
The tree in Figure 1 illustrates the similarities and differences between prokaryotes with respect to their repertoire
of recognisable protein domain families. There is clearly a
correlation between domain complement and phylogeny;
for example, the Archaea form a distinct cluster that is
clearly separated from the Bacteria. Furthermore, within
the Bacteria, the Cyanobacteria, Gram-positive Bacteria,
chlamydias and mycoplasmas each fall into distinct clusters. However, there are some striking discrepancies

between the protein domain-based clustering and phylogenetic classification. For example, the oral pathogen
Treponema denticola (marked with an asterisk in Figure 1)
clusters with the dental bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum rather than with its fellow spirochetes T. pallidum and
Borrelia burgdorferi.
It is notable that the Proteobacteria do not form a single
distinct cluster in the protein-domain based classification
in Figure 1. The cluster that contains the gamma-proteobacterial Pseudomonas and Xanthomonas species also contains the beta-Proteobacteria R. solanacearum and
Chromobacterium violaceum. This probably reflects that
these organisms have relatively large genomes and therefore share in common some common protein domains
that are not encoded in smaller more streamlined
genomes. Conversely X. fastidiosa, which has a relatively

small genome, falls into a cluster with Neisseria
meningitidis.
Interestingly, the plant pathogen E. caratovora fell into a
cluster with Yersinia pestis, Salmonella species and E. coli,
which are animal pathogens and commensals. This indicates that despite differing lifestyles, these species have
diverged relatively little with respect to loss and gain of
protein domain families.
Overall, the results of clustering bacterial proteomes on
the basis of their domain content suggested that in addition to phylogeny, an organism's domain repertoire may
reflect other factors, possibly including genome size and
lifestyle. These preliminary observations led us to investigate whether it is possible to identify any particular
domains or domain architectures that may be characteristic of a plant-associated lifestyle.
Protein domain families restricted to plant-associated
bacteria
We queried the Pfam 16.0 database to determine the species distribution of each of the 7,677 domain families. Of
these, 85 were found in at least one of the completely
sequenced plant associated bacteria but absent from all
other completely sequenced bacteria. Most of these
domain families are restricted to a single species or group
of very closely related organisms. For example, domain of
unknown function DUF1484 (Pfam:PF07363) appears to
be restricted to Ralstonia solanacearum, whilst DUF1520
(Pfam:PF07480) is restricted to Bradyrhizobium japonicum
and Sinorhizobium meliloti. Although it is possible that
these species-specific domain families are involved in
pathogenesis or symbiosis it is equally likely that they
have some unrelated function. However, several domains
are potentially interesting from the point of view of plantmicrobe interactions either because they are found in phylogenetically disparate species of phytobacteria or because
they are also found in eukaryotes. Table 1 lists the domain
families that are found in plant-associated members of
more than one subdivision of the Proteobacteria, but are
not found in any non-plant-associated bacteria. Several of
these are already implicated in host-plant interactions. For
example, proteins belonging to the NolX family
(Pfam:PF05819) include HrpF from the gamma-proteobacterium X. campestris and NolX from the alpha-proteobacterium Rhizobium fredii and Rhizobium species
NGR234. In these rhizobia, NolX (also referred to as
NopX) has been shown to play a role in nodulation specificity and is exclusively expressed during the early stages
of interactions with plants [25,26]. NolX is thought to
facilitate protein secretion into the plant host via a type III
secretion system [27], and a similar role has been postulated for X. campestris HrpF [28]. The importance of members of the NolX family in microbe-plant interactions is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/17

reinforced by our observation that they are also found in
several other plant-associated alpha- and gamma-Proteobacteria as well as in the phytopathogenic beta-proteobacterium R. solanacearum (see Table 1), but are not found in
any other completely sequenced genomes. Similarly, the
Avirulence domain (Pfam:PF03377) is restricted to the
phytopathogens R. solanacearum and Xanthomonas species
[29].
A further protein family limited to plant-associated bacteria is characterised by the ice nucleation repeat
(Pfam:PF00818)and is found in proteins that may have a
role in frost damage to host plants. It remains to be seen
whether the remaining two domain families (DUF811
and DUF1427) are involved in the plant-associated lifestyle. DUF1427 (Pfam:PF07235) is restricted to several
plant-associated alpha-Proteobacteria, the beta-proteobacterium R. solanacearum and the gamma-Proteobacteria
P. aeruginosa and X. campestris (Table 1). Although their
functions are unknown, proteins containing DUF1427 are
thus candidates for involvement in interactions with
plants or may at least have a role in plant-associated lifestyles. Several of these proteins have predicted signal peptide sequences and / or predicted transmembrane regions,
suggesting an extracytoplasmic location. This may be
indicative of a role in extracellular interactions with plants
or with other components of the environment. Table 2
lists the 13 protein domain families that appear to be
restricted to plant-associated bacteria and to eukaryotes
and/or Archaea. Interestingly, this highlights at least one
example of a protein domain that has probably been
recruited into plant-associated bacteria from a plant host.
Proteins
containing
a
RolB/RolC-like
domain
(Pfam:PF02027) are found to be restricted to plant-associated alpha-Proteobacteria and to plants of the genus
Nicotiana (see Table 2 and Figure 2). The activity of these
proteins in plants may lead to an increase in intracellular
auxin activity caused by the release of active auxins from
inactive beta-glucosides [30,31]. The presence of many
Agrobacterium-like proteins in Rhizobium (Agrobacterium)
vitis reflects another key feature of the biology of these
plant-associated bacteria, the fact that many of the genes
involved directly in Agrobacterium and Rhizobium- plant
interactions are encoded on large plasmids that facilitate
lateral gene transfer of complex and novel traits between
bacteria. Rhizobium (Agrobacterium) vitis is not a symbiont,
but rather causes a tumorigenic disease of grapevine
through the action of a number of A. tumefaciens-like
genes [32].
Protein domain families that are over-represented in
plant-associated bacteria
Bacterial physiology and behaviour is determined not
only by the presence or absence of particular proteins but
also by numbers of representatives of protein families. For

example, gene duplication events may lead to a lineagespecific expansion that results in novel orthologues that
can take on novel functions different from that of the
parent gene. Therefore we investigated whether any protein domain families were over-represented in the plantassociated proteobacteria with respect to the background
distribution of domains in all Proteobacteria for which
complete sequences were available. For each of the 7,677
Pfam domain families, we counted the numbers of proteins in which that domain family occurs in the complete
proteomes of Erwinia carotovora, Pseudomonas syringae
pathovar tomato, Ralstonia solanacearum, Sinorhizobium
meliloti, Bradyrhizobium japonicum, Mesorhizobium loti,
Agrobacterium tumefaciens (Washington strain and Dupont
strain), Xanthomonas campestris pathovar campestris, Xanthomonas axonopodis pathovar citri, Xylella fastidiosa and
Xylella fastidiosa (strain Temecula1). We then calculated a
P value for the probability of observing at least this
number of occurrences given the background frequency in
the Proteobacteria and assuming a binomial distribution.
The smaller the P value, the less likely that the observed
frequency occurred by chance. In other words, the smaller
the P value, the more over-represented is the domain family. The most over-represented domains are listed in Table
3.
The domain with the statistically most significant overrepresentation in the plant-associated bacteria was the
guanylate cyclase domain (Pfam:PF00211). This domain
was particularly abundant in B. japonicum (32 proteins)
and S. meliloti (24 proteins). No other fully-sequenced
proteobacterium encodes more than three, although the
spirochaete Leptospira interrogans encodes 17 proteins
matching PF00211). Cyclic-diGMP, the product of guanylate cyclase, is a secondary messenger that plays a role in
cell-cell and cell-surface contact in several bacteria by regulating cellular adhesion genes [33]. Such interactions are
very important in initiating bacterial infection of eukaryotic organisms and this may account in part for the high
numbers of such domains in these plant-associated
bacteria. Of particular interest is the observation that one
response regulator from C. crescentus has been shown to
become sequestered to the cell pole following phosphorylation [35]. This is coupled to the activation of the guanylate cyclase domain, suggesting that localised synthesis
of this secondary message could induce local effects
within specific regions of the bacterial cell.
Another domain with statistically significant over-representation in the plant-associated bacteria was the bacterial
luciferase-like monooxygenase domain (Pfam:PF00296).
This domain was particularly abundant in the plant-associated alpha-Proteobacteria with 15 proteins in Agrobacterium tumefaciens, 11 proteins in B. japonicum and 9
proteins in M. loti containing this domain. The related

Rhodopseudomonas palustris have 3, 2, 2 and 0 luciferase
(PF00296) proteins respectively. Other species containing
large numbers of luciferase-like proteins include Mycobacterium bovis (13 proteins) and M. tuberculosis (14
proteins).
Several domains of unknown function are amongst those
most over-represented in the phytobacteria. For example,
DUF636 is unusually abundant in the rhizobia with 16
representative proteins in B. japonicum and 14 and 13 in
M. loti and S. meliloti respectively. Other prokaryotes
encode between 0 and 5 DUF636 proteins, whilst Arabidopsis thaliana and Homo sapiens each encode one.
Domain architectures
The functionality of the proteome depends not only on
the repertoire of protein domains but also on the interactions and cellular context of those domains. One important aspect of this context is the range of combinations of
domains within a protein; that is the domain architecture
of proteins.

We used the Pfam database to ascertain the domain architecture of every protein sequence from each bacterial species for which a complete annotated genome sequence
was available. 3,774 distinct protein domain architectures
were found in R. solanacearum, P. aeruginosa, E. carotovora
(subspecies atroseptica), P. syringae (pathovar tomato), B.
japonicum, S. meliloti, M. loti, A. tumefaciens, X. fastidiosa, X.
campestris, X. axonopodis. 459 of the 3,774 domain architectures encoded in genomes of plant-associated bacteria
were absent in all other bacteria for which complete
genome sequences were available. These 459 architectures
are listed in the supplementary data. However, many of
these architectures were restricted to a single species or
several closely related species and so were of limited interest for this study.
We were particularly interested to discover whether any
domain architectures are related to plant-associated lifestyle rather than simply resulting from phylogeny. The 15
protein architectures illustrated in Table 4 were each
found in plant-associated bacteria from at least two different divisions of the Proteobacteria and were not found in
any other non-plant-associated organisms. For example,
polypeptide sequences consisting of an N-terminal
domain of unknown function DUF442 fused to a metallobeta-lactamase domain are restricted to A. tumefaciens, M.
loti, S. meliloti, X. fastidiosa and X. fastidiosa.The metallobeta-lactamase domain (Pfam:PF00753) is common and
widespread, being found in over 2000 different proteins
from a wide range of organisms. However, only in these
proteins from plant-associated bacteria is the metallobeta-lactamase domain fused to DUF442. This suggests

helping bacteria to adapt to a changing environment, an
ability of little value to X. fastidiosa in its restricted and relatively constant niches.

One regulatory domain found in large numbers in Pseudomonas genome is the PAS domain (Pfam PF00989) [36],
which is present in 25 ORFs in P. aeruginosa PAO1 and 30
ORFs in P. syringae pathovar tomato. The average number
of PAS-containing ORFs in complete proteobacterial
genomes is about 10. Although PAS domains are only
found in a limited subset of bacterial regulators, they are
at the forefront of molecular innovation with 9 of the
novel architectures identified in P. aeruginosa, and 5 of
those in P. syringae pathovar tomato containing PAS
domains (see supplementary data for more details). Xanthomonas genomes also encode a large number of PAScontaining polypeptides, (18 and 21 in X. axonopodis and
X. campestris respectively). However, each X. fastidiosa
encodes only one: PhoR, a regulator generally associated
with responses to phosphate limitation. Ten novel PAS
architectures are present in each Xanthomonas genome, of
which 7 are common and 3 are unique to each strain
(some of which are illustrated in Figure 3). PAS domains,
which are involved in sensing light, oxygen and other
environmental factors, have particular importance in

One intriguing signal transduction domain identified in
unique domain architectures from both P. syringae and
Xanthomonas
was
a
phytochrome
domain
(Pfam:PF00360) (Figure 4). This domain enables lightmediated signal transduction in plants and bacteria,
through binding a light-sensitive chromophore [37,38].
Phytochrome-containing proteins are used to detect light,
and to discriminate between different wavelengths of
light. Phytochromes are used for shade avoidance by
plants, and to detect depth in soil or water or other conditions where light is attenuated. The short list of bacteria
that contain phytochromes includes photosynthetic species (e.g. Rhodospirillum centenum, Anabaena species strain
PCC7120 and Synechocystis species strain PCC6803) as
well as plant associated bacteria (e.g. R. leguminosarum, A.
tumefaciens) and soil bacteria (e.g. P. putida) [38,39]. An
unusual photosynthetic strain, Bradyrhizobium species
ORS278 uses phytochrome to regulate the photosynthesis
gene cluster and a similar induction was seen with Rhodopseudomonas pallustris but not with several other photosynthetic bacteria [40]. It is not known why phytochrome

proteins are retained in non-photosynthetic bacteria but it
has been suggested that the phytochrome-like sensor
kinases in Agrobacterium may play a role in detecting
depth in soil strata as a means of optimising interactions
with roots [39]. Most of the bacterial phytochrome proteins have a PAS domain and a GAF domain at the N-terminus and a histidine kinase domain at the C-terminus
(see Figure 4), though a phytochrome from Rhodobacter
sphaeroides (UniProt:Q8VRN4; see Figure 4) has a more
complex domain architecture [40]. The presence of two

phytochromes in P. syringae, one of them with a unique
architecture, may reflect the recruitment of phytochrome
to a novel regulatory function unique to P. syringae. Protein PSPTO2652 from P. syringae is unique in that it has
an additional C-terminal histidine kinase. Another unusual domain architecture is the PAS-GAF-PhytochromePAS organisation found in Xanthomonas proteins
XAC4293 and XCC4154 (Figure 4), which, if shown to be
functional, may represent a new phytochrome protein
family.

Further analysis of novel Pseudomonas protein domain
architectures
The availability of multiple finished and unfinished Pseudomonas genomes allowed us to study in more detail the
distribution, genomic context and properties of Pseudomonas gene products highlighted by this analysis. Closer
examination of the genomic context of the P. syringae
genes encoding proteins with unusual domain architectures showed that most were flanked on either or both
sides by genes that have few or no orthologues in other
Pseudomonas strains, suggesting that these novel genes
have been recruited simultaneously with other genes, possibly of related function, or that they have recombined
into the genome at hotspots for recombination and insertion of alien DNA.

To further address the hypothesis that at least some of
these architectures have been acquired by horizontal gene
transfer we examined the GC content and third position
GC content of each of these genes, in comparison to the
total genome (0.593 GC, 0.716 GC3). Sixteen of the genes
deviated from the average GC3 content by more than
0.05. High GC3 content genes include pvsA, PSPTO4084,
PSPTO2413 and cfa6. Low GC3 content genes include
hrpZ, PSPTO3210, glf, PSPTO4696, hopPtoS(1,2 & 3),
PSPTO2259, PSPTO0400, avrF and PSPTO1070. The GC
content of flanking genes frequently reflected that of the
novel gene, most strikingly for glf, PSPTO2441,
PSPTO4696, hopPtoS(1,2 &3), PSPTO4699, PSPTO1070
& PSPTO2632, which were each associated with low GC
regions containing few ORFs with orthologues in other
Pseudomonas genomes.
One other feature frequently associated with horizontally
transferred genes is the presence of IS elements, tRNAs,
plasmid and phage genes in flanking regions.
PSPTO3229, PSPTO4569, PSPTO2312, PSPTO2829,
PSPTO2310, Glf, PSPTO2441, PSPTO4696 and
PSPTO2326 are all located in close proximity to IS elements and phage-like sequences, or in defined regions of
the genome flanked by IS elements and phage-like
sequences (see Figure 5).
Overall, this analysis suggests that a large number of the
novel architectures present in P. syringae pathovar. tomato
are uniquely associated with this species or pathovar of
Pseudomonas, and that many of these genes have been
acquired by horizontal gene transfer and are located in
regions of the genome with a high potential for recombination and rearrangement.

Conclusions
Our initial observations, from the clustering of complete
prokaryotic proteomes on the basis of domain content,
motivated us to test whether any protein domains or

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/17

domain architectures are specifically associated with a
plant-associated lifefstyle. We identified nine protein
domain families that are found in phylogenetically
diverse plant-associated bacteria but not in non-plantassociated Bacteria (Table 1). Inevitably, there is an
element of random chance in the species distribution of
domain families; however, we observed that most of
domains whose functions are at least partly known are
implicated in the plant associated lifestyle. Therefore it
seems possible that the two domains of unknown
function (DUF811 and DUF1427) may also turn out to be
significant for this lifestyle. Several domain families were
also found only in plant pathogenic bacteria and in
eukaryotes (Table 2). For example the RolB/RolC-like
domain family is restricted to plant-associated bacteria
and to plants of the genus Nicotiana, and is implicated in
modulating auxin activity.
Having investigated patterns of presence or absence of
domains within bacterial proteomes, we next identified
which domains are most over-represented in the plantpathogenic Proteobacteria as compared with the frequency of occurrence in all the sequenced Proteobacteria
(Table 3). Amongst the most over-represented domains
was the guanylate cyclase domain. This was largely due to
the large number of guanylate-cyclase-like proteins
encoded by B. japonicum and S. meliloti. Although this
approach may have revealed some potential leads for
further investigation, it should be remembered that this
analysis was rather crude and susceptible to the biased
phylogenetic distribution of the organisms for which
complete genome sequence data are currently available.
However, detailed analysis of the frequency distributions
of protein domain families in various organisms may
yield rewards.
As well as the repertoire of domains, another important
aspect of a proteome is the repertoire of domain
architectures; that is the combinations of domains found
within a single protein. Just as for the repertoire of
domains, the species distribution of a domain architecture might be explained by chance. Nevertheless, the proteins listed in Table 4 may be a good starting point for
further investigation of bacterium-plant interactions.
Many of these protein identified in this study have N-terminal predicted signal peptide motifs, suggesting that
they are secreted. Further experiments are required to
determine whether proteins of unknown function will
also have a role in plant-specific functions. Many proteins
involved in bacteria-plant interactions, such as TTSSsecreted effectors have subtle or conditional phenotypes,
and would not be identified in conventional mutant-phenotype screens. Assays to detect subtle differences in
growth in planta or in disease development are labour-

intensive. Bioinformatic analyses such as this one represent useful and informative tools for reducing experimental search space, particularly when combined with other
post-genomic techniques such as microarray analyses.
We found relatively little evidence of lateral dissemination of niche-specific novel architectures between phylogenetically distinct divisions in the Proteobacteria, with
less than 20 phytobacteria-specific domain architectures
present in two or more divisions of the Proteobacteria. We
did identify a number of domain architectures and
domains that were uniquely conserved in both plant-associated prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The methodology used
in this study makes no prior assumptions about the nature
or cause of "uniqueness". Unique architectures identified
using this approach include rare domains, novel domain
combinations and architectures that are truncated relative

to the majority of similar proteins (which may represent
deletions and loss of function mutations). Some proteins
will inevitability be included or excluded because of the
limitations of current domain prediction technology.
However, in addition to identifying protein candidates for
further investigation, this type of analysis can be used to
challenge and improve current models for domain prediction and expose errors and limitations of genome
sequence data and protein prediction. For example, consider a case in which a protein is identified as having the
"unique" architecture B~C~D. Additional examination of
the protein may reveal that the protein has a similar
sequence to proteins with the architecture A~B~C~D. The
absence of the A domain may indicate a genuine alteration in structure and potentially in function, or a
frameshift in the genome sequence data, or a functional
"A" domain that fails to meet current predictive criteria.

Each of these hypotheses can be tested by further research

performed using PHYLIP [41]. Trees were visualised using
ATV [51].

Although our approaches to identifying candidate genes
and proteins of significance to lifestyle have led to several
potential leads and interesting hypotheses, there are some
caveats. Firstly, evolution does not proceed exclusively
through loss and gain of domains and domain shuffling;
for example, protein innovation can also occur through
mutation and divergence within domain families. Also, it
is becoming increasingly apparent that an organism's
physiology, behaviour and ecology depend as much on
higher order 'systems level' phenomena as on the inventory of molecular components.

BLAST [42] searches were performed using the NCBI [48]
and Expasy [49] web servers. Comparison between Pseudomonas genomes was aided by use of PseudoDB [50].
Transmembrane and signal peptide predictions were
taken from Pfam, which in turn uses TMHMM [45] and
SignalP [43]. It should be remembered that predictive
methods often have difficulty distinguishing between signal peptides and N-terminal transmembrane helices [44].

We chose to base our surveys of protein domains on the
Pfam because this mature database is relatively comprehensive in its coverage (e.g. compared with SMART) and
its data is of high quality. Furthermore, its data is distributed in a form that is ideally suited for constructing database queries such as those in this study. Another
advantage is that in Pfam no two domains ever overlap in
their coverage of a protein sequence, which significantly
simplifies the analysis. However, it should be noted that
Pfam is not absolutely infallible and some of its threshold
values are rather stringent, leading to failure to identify
some 'outlying' members of a domain family.

In summary, this study has described and applied a new
approach for identifying architectural innovation and
potentially important domains in proteins from genome
sequence data. The data generated in this study have highlighted a large number of interesting and largely uncharacterised novel proteins and suggested new insights into
the molecular basis of interactions between bacteria and
their plant hosts, which will provide inspiration for future
experimental research.

Methods
The Pfam relational database data files were downloaded
from the Pfam website [46]. The census of domains and
architectures were taken from Pfam release 16.0 (November 2004) using custom PERL scripts to wrap SQL queries
against the Pfam relational database.
The complete bacterial genomes included in Pfam 16.0,
and hence considered in this study, are listed in the supplementary data. We excluded from the analysis of
domain architectures all protein sequences in UniProt
[47] that are designated as fragments.
A file listing the presence or absence of each Pfam domain
in each proteome can be found in the supplementary
data. Each row in this file represented a vector used for the
clustering of bacterial proteomes. Neighbour-joining was
