Abstract
Background: The Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) was first developed to measure the
synonymous codon usage bias for a DNA or RNA sequence. The CAI quantifies the similarity
between the synonymous codon usage of a gene and the synonymous codon frequency of a
reference set.
Results: We describe here CAIcal, a web-server available at http://genomes.urv.es/CAIcal that
includes a complete set of utilities related with the CAI. The server provides useful important
features, such as the calculation and graphical representation of the CAI along either an individual
sequence or a protein multiple sequence alignment translated to DNA. The automated calculation
of CAI and its expected value is also included as one of the CAIcal tools. The software is also free
to be downloaded as a standalone application for local use.
Conclusion: The CAIcal server provides a complete set of tools to assess codon usage adaptation
and to help in genome annotation.
Reviewers: This article was reviewed by Purificación López-García, Dan Graur, Rob Knight and
Shamil Sunyaev.

Background
Ever since a relatively high number of DNA sequences
were publicly available in databases, several statistical
analyses addressing DNA composition have been performed. One of the parameters that first interested the scientist was codon usage [1]. It was soon discovered that a
considerable heterogeneity in the codon usage exists
between genes within species and that the degree of codon
bias is positively correlated with gene expression [2,3]. To
quantify the degree of bias in the codon usage of genes,
several parameters or indices have been worked out. The

Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) developed by Sharp and
Li [4], rapidly became one of the most used indices. The
CAI is a measure of the synonymous codon usage bias for
a DNA or RNA sequence and quantifies codon usage similarities between a gene and a reference set. The index
ranges from 0 to 1, being 1 if a gene always uses the most
frequently used synonymous codons in the reference set.
The CAI has been used for estimation of gene expressivity
and for prediction of highly expressed genes [5-9]; for giving an approximate indication of the likely success of heterologous gene expression [7]; for detecting dominating

synonymous codon usage bias in genomes [3]; for acquiring new knowledge about species lifestyle [3,10]; and for
studying cases of horizontally transferred genes [11,12].

Results and discussion
The most important contribution that we aim to provide
with our server is to tie together several features, previously existing but disseminated throughout the Internet,
and some new features related to CAI calculation and
analysis, and to implement them into a single and easy-touse web site.
Description of the CAIcal server
The CAIcal web-server, freely available at http://
genomes.urv.es/CAIcal, calculates the CAI for a group of
sequences using different reference sets and includes a
complete set of tools related with codon usage adaptation,
e.g. the representation of the CAI along a sequence or
multialignment and the estimation of an expected CAI
value (eCAI). CAI is calculated following the original
method proposed by Sharp and Li [4] but using the recent
computer implementation proposed by Xia [13]. In the
following subsections we describe the inputs of the server
and its main features.
Inputs of the server
The inputs for the server depend on the calculation to be
performed. The basic inputs for calculating CAI are the
query sequences, the reference set and the genetic code
used for translation. The query sequences must be DNA or
RNA sequences in fasta format. The server first checks
whether the query sequences are a DNA or RNA region
that codifies a protein. The reference set required to calculate the CAI can be introduced in a variety of formats,
including that of the Codon Usage Database [14]. A direct
link to this database is provided in the CAIcal interface.
This database contains codon usage tables extracted from
GenBank and organized by species. Several of the calculations available in CAIcal, such as the CAI calculation and
its representation in a sequence, can be used with two reference sets simultaneously. Therefore, it is easier to compare the codon usage of a gene with respect to the codon
usage of two different organisms and check whether it is
more adapted to one of them. See the tutorial available
from the server home page for a complete description of
errors and warnings and for more information about
input requirements.
Set of tools
A number of programs and servers that calculate CAI for a
gene or a group of genes are available elsewhere, such as
CodonW, EMBOSS [15], CAIJava [3], CAI Analyser [8], as
well as JCAT [16] and the CAI Calculator [5]. All of these
tools represent valuable resources.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/38

The server first provides a number of basic calculations
that are also available elsewhere:
(i) The absolute and synonymous codon usage of a group
of DNA sequences and other useful parameters such as
length, total G+C content and G+C content at the three
codon positions, and the effective number of codons [17].
(ii) The CAI of a DNA sequence or group of sequences.
This index measures the adaptation of the synonymous
codon usage of a gene to the synonymous codon usage of
up to two reference sets that can be chosen by the user.
The new features incorporated in this server are:
(iii) An expected value of CAI [18] is determined by randomly generating 500 sequences from the G+C content
and the amino acid composition of the query sequences.
This expected CAI therefore provides a direct threshold
value for discerning whether the differences in the CAI
value are statistically significant and arise from the codon
preferences or whether they are merely artefacts that arise
from internal biases in the G+C composition and/or
amino acid composition of the query sequences. The ECAI module that calculates the expected CAI values has
been previously described [18]. Additionally, one of the
tools included in CAIcal is a graphical local user interface
that can be downloaded and allows the calculation of the
CAI and eCAI of hundreds or thousands of sequences on
a whole-genome scale easily [18].
(iv) The weight of each codon, i.e. the frequency of codon
use compared to the frequency of use of the optimal
codon for that amino acid in the reference set, can be
graphically represented along a DNA sequence using a
sliding window defined by the user. This result provides
an intuitive visualisation of the changes in the CAI
throughout the input and identifies discontinuities that
might correlate with informational and/or operational
features of the DNA sequence. The CAIscan tool of the CAI
Analyser package [8] allows a similar analysis, i.e. scanning a sequence calculating the CAI over a selected window.
(v) A graphical representation can be made of the weight
of each codon along a multiple protein alignment that has
been translated to a DNA alignment using a unique reference set for all the sequences of the alignment or using a
reference set for each sequence. The inputs for this option
are a protein multialignment in clustal format, the DNA
sequence of each of the sequences of the multialignment
with the same identification field between the DNA and
protein sequences and one or more codon usage tables to
use as reference sets. This result provides a graphical display that enables the protein sequence alignment to be

correlated with the informational/compositional content
of the DNA sequence that encodes them.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/38

The options available in the server are summarized in Figure 1. All these options are accessible from the main page
of the server and several links have been created between
them. As an example, after the CAI value of a group of

or RNA sequences, a codon usage reference table and/or a protein alignment), the server calculates gene parameters such as
%G+C, Relative Synonymous Codon Usage (RSCU) and Effective Number of Codons (ENc), the CAI for one or more DNA or
RNA sequences and an expected CAI and represents the CAI along a DNA sequence or in a protein multialignment translated
to DNA.

sequences has been calculated, an expected CAI value can
be estimated or the graphical representation of the CAI
value along each sequence can be visualized. Several
parameters used in the calculations, such as the window
length in the graphical representation of the CAI along a
sequence or the upper confidence limit to estimate an
expected CAI, are defined by the user. The results are
therefore flexible and fit the needs of the user. For the
results, the server produces several tables and graphs
together with several text boxes containing the results in a
tab-delimited format have been created, which makes it
easy to copy and paste them into spreadsheet programs.
Finally, a tutorial, a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
section and several examples are available from the home
page of the server.

sequences is 96 nucleotides located at 5' end of HPV63 E4.
We can use the CAIcal server to show that the codon usage
of these 96 nucleotides at the beginning of HPV63 E4 is
very different from that of the rest of the E4 sequence,
measured as the CAI value calculated with the human
codon usage as reference (figure 2). This suggests that the
acceptor splice site of HPV63 E4 is not well annotated and
that the true E4 nested within E2 probably starts downstream from the annotated position.

Example of how to use the CAIcal server
The CAIcal was used to annotate the genomic discontinuity in the E4 gene of human papilomavirus 1 (HPV1).
Papillomaviruses (PVs) are a family of small dsDNA
viruses that cause a variety of diseases including cervical
cancer. The genome of PVs is modular with three different
regions, each of which has a different evolutionary rate
[19,20]. These regions are: an upstream regulatory region,
an early region that codes for proteins (e.g. E1, E2, E4, E5,
E6 and E7) involved in viral transcription, replication, cell
proliferation and other steps of the viral life cycle, and a
structural region that contains two genes that code for the
capsid proteins L1 and L2. A general characteristic of genes
encoded in human PVs is their peculiar codon usage preference compared to the preferred codon usage in human
genes [21,22], although the exact reason for this poor
adaptation to the genome of their host is still unknown.
Like other viral genomes, some of the PV genes overlap
partially or completely. This is the case of the E4 gene,
which is completely nested within the E2 gene in a different reading frame [23]. The function of E4 is not completely understood and its annotation is not very rigorous
[14]. The mature E4 protein appears after splicing, with
the donor site situated some codons downstream from
the start codon of the E1 gene, and the acceptor site situated close to the middle of the E2 gene [24,25]. The fact
that most of E4 overlaps with E2, that the mature E1^E4
protein contains a few amino acids from E1 and that the
splice sites are not strictly conserved, makes it difficult to
determine the true E4 sequence in silico. The E4 PVs genes
available in the databases are therefore very different in
length and similarity. Although the genomes of many PVs
have been sequenced, information about the expression
of their genes or cDNA sequences is only available for a
few of them. One of these is HPV1. In this case, the annotation of the HPV1 E4 gene is confirmed by mRNA data
[26]. However, the E4 gene from HPV63, a PV that is phylogenetically related to HPV1 [19,20,27], is longer than
the E4 gene from HPV1. The difference is between both

Competing interests

Conclusion
The CAIcal server provides a complete set of tools to assess
codon usage adaptation and helps to annotate genomic
discontinuities such as the donor splicing site of the E4
ORF of papilomaviruses.

The authors declare that they have no competing interests.

Reviewers' comments
Reviewer's report 1: Purificación López-García, CNRS,
Université Paris-Sud
This article describes a series of tools for the automatic calculation of the codon adaptation index (CAI) and related
measurements from input and reference data that have
been implemented in a web-based server http://
genomes.urv.es/CAIcal. CAI values are useful for a variety
of purposes going from genomic annotation and gene
expression analyses to the detection of potential horizontal gene transfer events. Although, as pointed out by the
authors, a number of freely available facilities providing
the calculation of CAI exist already, this new set of tools
offers the possibility to obtain some additional estimates.
These include the calculation of expected CAIs from randomly generated sequences with the GC content and
amino acid composition of the input sequences that can
be compared then with the observed CAIs, as well as
measurements of the weight of each codon and their
graphical representation. An example of the possible utility of these CAI measurements to test and validate annotations is provided. I find that this group of tools
accessible online will be useful to the scientific community. I hope that this web-based server will benefit and get
improved with the progressive input and suggestions of a
wide variety of users.

Representation of the CAI, calculated using the human mean codon usage as a reference set, in the DNA
sequence that encodes HPV63 E2 and E4. Part A represents the reading frame that encodes E2. Part B represents the
same HPV63 genome fragment that encodes E2, but in the reading frame +1, which contains E4. The grey line in B represents
the fragment of HPV63 E4 homologous to the closely related HPV1 E4. The black line in B represents the stretch also annotated as HPV63 E4, but which lacks homology with HPV1 E4. Note that the initial E4 region from HPV63, which is not homologous to the HPV1 gene, has an extremely low CAI, which suggests a wrong annotation for the E4 gene in HPV63. This figure
was obtained using the output of the calculation of CAI along a sequence of the CAIcal server, with a window length of 11 and
a window step of 5.

Reviewer's report 2: Dan Graur, Department of Biology
and Biochemistry, University of Houston
A very simple and straightforward tool for dealing with
codon usage. I have no other comments.
Reviewer's report 3: Rob Knight, University of Colorado
In this manuscript, Puigbo et al. describe their CAIcal web
server. CAI, the Codon Adaptation Index, is an important
concept relating codon usage to gene expression.
Although several software tools online already calculate
CAI, CAIcal appears to offer a unique combination of
functionality that is not easily duplicated using other
tools.

However, the tool in its current form would appear to be
a relatively minor advance over existing tools, and I would
strongly encourage the authors to consider an extensive
overhaul of the software and the manuscript before publication. However, I think the present work contains the
seeds of a useful contribution to the field and to the literature, and definitely encourage the authors to persevere,
perhaps thinking more carefully about the target audience
of the software and the paper.
More attention needs to be paid to the specific contribution of this work if it is to be published as an independent
piece of software. No feature of this tool really appears to
be unique, e.g. the plots of CAI along a gene and codonby-codon are also in Codon Analyser (as the authors
note), many tools allow calculation of CAI against a reference set, etc.
Authors' response: As we acknowledge in the manuscript, a
number of tools are available elsewhere addressing different
calculations around CAI. We consider however, that one of the
strengths of the CAIcal server is to gather together pre-existing
and new features into a single and easy-to-use web site, as you
also note in your revision "CAIcal appears to offer a unique
combination of functionality that is not easily duplicated using
other tools". As an example, after the CAI value of a group of
sequences has been calculated, the user can easily (with only a
click of the mouse) estimate an expected CAI value for discerning whether the differences in CAI are statistically significant
or whether they are merely artifacts. The graphical representation of the CAI value along each sequence can also be easily visualised. In addition, we also want to point out the usability of
the server, used to denote here the ease with which people can
employ a particular tool. Thus, several of the existing tools that
allow calculation of CAI are not web-servers; other require some
kind of installation or execution; and some of them provide easy
calculations that lack in flexibility. Finally, the server allows to
represent the CAI value along a protein multialignment backtranslated to DNA, a feature currently not available elsewhere.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/38

Similarly, the calculations of the expected CAI values are
delegated to another tool, E-CAI, that the authors have
previously published, but this is not very clear from the
description in the paper. If the sole contribution is to tie
together several pre-existing features into a single web site,
the authors need to make the case much more clearly that
this combination will be of use to end users in a way that
the individual pre-existing tools are not.
Authors' response: We have added a new sentence in the
paper clarifying this point.
I think the source code of the standalone version needs a
substantial overhaul before publication. It is full of large,
error-prone tables of redundant information about
genetic codes, for example, which should be dynamically
calculated from a compact, standardized and easily verified source (e.g. the NCBI genetic code tables), is essentially without useful comments, mixes presentation and
logic, and has many other indicators of poor coding style
(for example, it looks as though several separate applications have simply been pasted together).
Authors' response: Although the main aim of our work was
to provide a web-based server for CAI analysis, this was a fair
criticism. The source code needed an extensive revision of style
and lacked useful comments that could guide the experienced
user. We have largely rewritten it and it incorporates now
numerous comments about the functionality of each different
part. Thus, we have developed the local version 1.3. The source
code in the standalone application follows a descendent algorithm rather than several separate applications have simply
been pasted together. For the sake of clarity, we have included
a file with a detailed description of the CAIcal functions (this
file is available from the web site in the FAQs section – http:/
/genomes.urv.es/CAIcal/FAQs.html. The standalone application includes now new functions related with genetic codes to
avoid putative error-prone in tables. Though, again, you are
right and the coding style could still be improved, the program
works well.
Although I appreciate that the authors have made the
effort to produce and distribute a standalone version, the
code unfortunately does not inspire confidence in the web
site either in this case. Test cases, e.g. using Perl's built-in
unit testing framework, would definitely be a useful addition to verify that the calculations are correct.
Authors' response: This was an interesting suggestion that
we have addressed. To verify that the calculations are correct,
we show that the results of the two independent programs (the
standalone version written in Perl and the web-server written in
PHP) are the same. In addition, we have compared our results
with the results using other existing programs and the results
are not significantly different. A file with some tests we made is

available from the web site in the FAQs section http://
genomes.urv.es/CAIcal/FAQs.html.
The utility of the Monte Carlo approach is also somewhat
unclear to me, as it appears that the expected CAI could be
calculated analytically, along with confidence intervals,
using the multinomial distribution. It is possible that this
is not feasible for numerical reasons, but some justification of the approach would be useful.
Authors' response: The expected CAI is calculated analytically from the CAI values of 500 randomly generated sequences
with the same G+C content and amino acid composition as the
query sequences. However, the Monte Carlo approach is used to
generate the random sequences, not to calculate the expected
CAI. In this sense, please see also Question 15 at the FAQs section of the server http://genomes.urv.es/CAIcal/FAQs.html.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/38

Reviewer's report 3 (second revision): Rob Knight,
University of Colorado
The revised versions of the manuscript and software are
significantly improved.
Reviewer's report 4: Shamil Sunyaev, Harvard Medical
School
This manuscript presents a new online tool to compute
codon adaptation index (CAI). Although there are several
CAI calculators available online, this new server includes
several additional features such as computation of
expected CAI and visualization of changes in the CAI
along the sequence. The authors also present an analysis
of papilomavirus as an example of the server utility. In
sum, the manuscript does not report any significant novel
scientific findings but presents a tool potentially useful for
the research community.

I did not find the example especially compelling, but this
is a relatively minor criticism and I understand that it is
likely that the authors would want to publish any especially interesting results separately from the description of
the tool itself. However, it might be interesting to try to
reproduce a well-known conclusion from existing work to
show how much easier it is with this workflow than with
pre-existing tools. There are many examples in the literature as CAI is such a widely-used technique.

Acknowledgements

The manuscript and the web site need substantial attention to the quality of the English. I have not corrected
minor wording and grammatical errors in this version of
the manuscript, but if the authors plan to publish this
manuscript regardless of the above comments, I would
definitely recommend careful attention to detail, and also
removing formatting errors such as the text "Sub-heading
for this section" on page 3. Overall, I think this is a good
first attempt and could ultimately be revised into a useful
contribution that is more suitable for publication.

References

Authors' response: After receiving your comments and the
comments of the three additional referees, we have decided to
rewrite the code, to revise the manuscript and to publish it. We
would like to thank you again for your comments. We think
that it is not necessary any further overhaul of the software, as
we agree that some changes were necessary in the manuscript
and in the source code of the standalone version, and have
accordingly been performed. We are glad to acknowledge that
the code is easier to read after introducing the comments you
suggested. Additional changes in the manuscript include also a
second revision of the quality of the English following the recommendations by the NIH Fellows Editorial Board, and some
clarifications. We sincerely consider that we have addressed the
criticism you raised to the previous version of the manuscript.
