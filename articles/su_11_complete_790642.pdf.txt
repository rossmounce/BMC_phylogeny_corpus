Abstract
Human adenovirus (HAdV) is a causative agent of acute respiratory disease, which is prevalent throughout the
world. Recently there are some reports which found that the HAdV-3 and HAdV-5 genomes were very stable
across 50 years of time and space. But more and more recombinant genomes have been identified in emergent
HAdV pathogens and it is a pathway for the molecular evolution of types. In our paper, we found a HAdV-7 GZ07
strain isolated from a child with acute respiratory disease, whose genome was E3-partial deleted. The whole
genome was 32442 bp with 2864 bp deleted in E3 region and was annotated in detail (GenBank: HQ659699). The
growth character was the same as that of another HAdV-7 wild strain which had no gene deletion. By comparison
with E3 regions of the other HAdV-B, we found that only left-end two proteins were remained: 12.1 kDa
glycoprotein and 16.1 kDa protein. E3 MHC class I antigen-binding glycoprotein, hypothetical 20.6 kDa protein,
20.6 kDa protein, 7.7 kDa protein., 10.3 kDa protein, 14.9 kDa protein and E3 14.7 kDa protein were all missing. It is
the first report about E3 deletion in human adenovirus, which suggests that E3 region is also a possible
recombination region in adenovirus molecular evolution.
Introduction
Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are implicated in a wide
range of human diseases, including respiratory, ocular,
metabolic, renal and gastrointestinal. They are responsible for 5-10% of lower respiratory tract infections in
infants and children throughout the world. HAdV-7, a
member of the B1 subspecies, causes acute respiratory
disease (ARD). This pathogen is identified in epidemics,
is highly virulent and is associated with clinical manifestations of considerable severity including residual lung
damage and fatal outcomes [1]. Previous reports suggested that HAdV-3 and -5 are very stable across
50 years of time and space [2,3], which is common in
DNA viruses. But HAdV in general are known to

undergo recombination. Earlier studies demonstrated in
vitro recombination. But more and more isolates, which
were isolated from adenovirus epidemic, undergo new
recombination between adenovirus types, which leaded
to new"intermediates” or subtypes [4]. All the evidence
supports the hypothesis that genome recombination
drives the molecular evolution of HAdV types. In our
research, we found a HAdV-7 strain isolated from a
child with acute respiratory disease, with a large portion
of E3 region deleted. The whole genome was annotated
(GenBank: HQ659699). It hints that E3 region is also
important in adenovirus recombination and molecular
evolution.

1. Cells, virus and Preparation of viral DNA

The virus strain (designated HAdV-7 GZ07) in this study
was isolated from nasal aspirates of a child with ARD in
southern China in 2007. The Nasal aspirate specimen
was inoculated to HEp-2 cells for isolation, which was
maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented

with 100 IU penicillin ml-1, 100 μg streptomycin ml-1 and
2% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. The cells were observed for
1-2 weeks for CPE, and the supernatant was identified by
a neutralization assay with type-specific reference antisera raised in rabbits by conventional procedures. Typespecific primers designed to the hypervariable regions
(HVRs) of the HAdV hexon were also utilized to correctly identify the serotypes. Viral DNA was extracted by
using a previously described method [5,6].
2. DNA restriction analysis

Restriction analysis was performed using restriction endonucleases (BamHI, EcoRI, EcoRV, HindIII, SalI, SmaI) and
the restriction profiles were compared with those of prototype and other genome-types described in the literature
and the genome-type denomination system [7].
3. DNA sequencing and analysis

According to the published sequences of HAdV-7 and
others types, the PCR primer pairs were designed to
amplify the fragments of the HAdV-GZ09 by using the
isolated viral DNA. These fragments were either cloned
and sequenced subsequently or sequenced directly from
the amplicon. It was sequenced by primer walking with
overlapping sequencing reactions. For confirmation of
the exact ends of the ITR sequence, a method described
by Zhang [5] was followed. All of the reported sequences
are the result of at least three sequencing reactions. The
sequencing reactions were carried out by using an ABI
Prism BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Ready
Reaction kit with AmpliTaq DNA polymerase on an ABI
3730 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Unresolved
and ambiguous sequences were resequenced with primers close to the regions in question.
Sequence assembly was carried out with the program
SeqMan 5.00 from the DNASTAR software package.
The genome sequence of HAdV-7 GZ07 was firstly
blasted in Genebank using megablast program, then
annotated by parsing the 32442 bases into 1-kb nonoverlapping segments which were queried systematically
against the nonredundant NCBI database using the
BLASTX program [8]. Default parameters of word
size = 3 and expectation = 10, with the BLOSUM62
substitution matrix and with gap penalties of 11 (existence) and 1 (extension), were applied to these analyses.
Low complexity sequences were filtered out of the
queries, as per the BLAST algorithm. Genome annotation, analysis of non coding DNA motifs and functional
protein motifs were performed by using the web based
gene prediction software GENEMARK software [9] and
determined putative proteins were performed with
blastp from NCBI http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/.
Whole-genome alignment and comparisons of the
sequences from HAdVs were performed by using the

Page 2 of 5

dot-plot software Advanced PipMaker http://pipmaker.
bx.psu.edu/cgi-bin/pipmaker?advanced, which aligns
long genomic DNA sequences quickly and with good
sensitivity [10].
E3 region of HAdV-7 GZ07 strain was analyzed and
compared with that of the other HAdV-B strains.
CLUSTALX was used to perform multiple-sequence
alignments of adenovirus E3 sequences. Phylogenetic
analysis was performed with the MEGA software package (version 4.1). The phylogenetic trees were constructed with the neighbor-joining method. Bootstrap
analysis was performed with 1,000 pseudoreplicates.

Results
1. Confirmation of serotype and genome type

Typical CPE was found in cells inoculated with HAdV-7
GZ07 strain and virus could be neutralized specifically
by mice serum against HAdV-7. Type-specific PCR
assay also indicated that this strain was serotype 7.
Further genome-typing results of restriction profiles
found difference between this strain and Gomen strain
(Figure 1).
2. General properties of the HAdV7-GZ07 genome
sequence

The complete genome of HAdV7-GZ07 is 32442 bp in
length with a base composition of 26.1% G, 26.0% C,
23.1% A and 24.8% T. The G+C content is 52.1%, which
is similar to that of other members of HAdV-B (5052%) (Shenk, 2001). We identified 41 coding regions
that are homologue to previously described gene products of other human adenoviruses. The annotation of
the predicted coding gene regions is listed in Additional
file 1: Table S1 (GenBank: HQ659699).

3. Whole genome comparison and E3 region analysis

HAdV-7 Gomen strain genome was chose as a reference
strain for whole genome comparison [11]. PipMaker
analysis suggested that there is an obvious genome deletion in HAdV7-GZ07 strain (Figure 2). Under detailed
scrutiny, 2864 bp was deleted in E3 region between nt
28365-31228; only left-end two proteins were remained,
12.1 kDa glycoprotein and 16.1 kDa protein. E3 MHC
class I antigen-binding glycoprotein, hypothetical
20.6 kDa protein, 20.6 kDa protein, 7.7 kDa protein.,
10.3 kDa protein, 14.9 kDa protein and E3 14.7 kDa
protein were all missing. The other parts shared close
identity with respect to nucleotide sequences, with only
two gaps and 14 bases mutation compared with Gomen
strain. (Additional file 2: Table S2)
4. E3 region phylogenetic analysis

A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the multiple alignments of the E3 region sequence data using the
program MEGA 4.1 by the neighbor-joining method
(Figure 3). The tree shows the phylogenetic relationship
among the selective adenovirus isolates. As can be seen
HAdV-7-GZ07 strain is very closed with Gomen strain.

Discussion
Although E3 is non-essential for viral replication in vitro,
experiments with both mice and cotton rats have shown
that it does play an important role in pathogenesis [12,13].
The size and composition of the E3 transcription unit vary
considerably among Ad species. The E3 region within adenovirus genomes encodes proteins that modulate the host
immune response to infection and are not essential for
viral growth in vitro [14]. The HAdV-7 E3 region was
found to encode the 12.1-, 16.1-, 19.3-, 7.7-, 10.3-, 14.9-,
and 14.7-kDa proteins. Additionally, two different 20.6-kDa

first sequence

proteins were contained within this transcript [11]. The
12.1-kDa protein has significant identity to an immunomodulating E3 protein in HAdV-7 Gomen strain. A glycoprotein of 16.1-kDa has homologs in other HAdV species. The
19.3-kDa protein is a major histocompatibility class I antigen-binding glycoprotein that prevents the lysis of adenoinfected host cells by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes [15]. Both
20.6-kDa proteins are similar to the CR1 (conserved region
1)-containing proteins in the E3 region of other HAdVs
and SAdVs. CR1 alpha and beta were described as species
HAdV-A specific gene products [16]. Prediction of transmembrane domains suggested that both gene products
were type Ia transmembrane proteins. The 7.7-kDa protein
is reported to insert itself into the host cell membrane; its
function is yet to be determined. The E3 7.7 K ORF
appears to be another area of the Ad genome in which
genetic diversity may be generated by illegitimate recombination [17]. A HAdV E3 transmembrane protein has identity to the HAdV-7 10.3-kDa protein. This may have a role
in downregulating the epidermal growth factor (EGF)
receptor [15]. The known RID (receptor internalization
and degradation) alpha and beta proteins are present in the
E3 transcription units of all HAdV. Both proteins are noncovalently associated integral membrane proteins (YxxO
motifs function as signals for transport and internalization
into lysosomes/endosomes RID alpha is a hydrophobic
protein and appears in two isoforms [16]). The last two
ORFs of the E3 region encodes 14.9-and 14.7-kDa proteins
that are present in all species of HAdV species [18]. It has
been shown to be located in the cytosol and nucleolus,
functioning as an inhibitor of TNF mediated cell lysis [19].

Homologous recombination has been recognized as an
important mechanism of evolution of adenovirus genomes [20]. In some types, e.g. HAdV-3 and HAdV-5,
the genomes are very stable [2,3,21]. But more and
more reports found new recombination between adenovirus subtypes, which leaded to new types [22]. Illegitimate recombination has previously been proposed to
contribute to Ad evolution by driving hexon sequence
variation and serotype differentiation [23,24]. Hypervariability in the hexon gene among Ad serotypes can
be explained as a response to host-immune pressure
[25]. The detail mechanism in adenovirus recombination
was not known. Some species or types may be amenable
to recombination based on sequence, e.g., hotspots, and
biology, e.g., cell tropism and coinfection [21]. Human
recombinase proteins may also have a propensity to
bind certain sequences in adenovirus genomes.
