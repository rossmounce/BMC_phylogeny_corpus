Abstract
Background: Urodele amphibians like the axolotl are unique among vertebrates in their ability to
regenerate and their resistance to develop cancers. It is unknown whether these traits are linked
at the molecular level.
Results: Blocking p53 signaling in axolotls using the p53 inhibitor, pifithrin-α, inhibited limb
regeneration and the expression of p53 target genes such as Mdm2 and Gadd45, suggesting a link
between tumor suppression and regeneration. To understand this relationship we cloned the p53
gene from axolotl. When comparing its sequence with p53 from other organisms, and more
specifically human we observed multiple amino acids changes found in human tumors. Phylogenetic
analysis of p53 protein sequences from various species is in general agreement with standard
vertebrate phylogeny; however, both mice-like rodents and teleost fishes are fast evolving. This
leads to long branch attraction resulting in an artefactual basal emergence of these groups in the
phylogenetic tree. It is tempting to assume a correlation between certain life style traits (e.g.
lifespan) and the evolutionary rate of the corresponding p53 sequences. Functional assays of the
axolotl p53 in human or axolotl cells using p53 promoter reporters demonstrated a temperature
sensitivity (ts), which was further confirmed by performing colony assays at 37°C. In addition,
axolotl p53 was capable of efficient transactivation at the Hmd2 promoter but has moderate
activity at the p21 promoter. Endogenous axolotl p53 was activated following UV irradiation (100
j/m2) or treatment with an alkylating agent as measured using serine 15 phosphorylation and the
expression of the endogenous p53 target Gadd45.
Conclusion: Urodele p53 may play a role in regeneration and has evolved to contain multiple
amino acid changes predicted to render the human protein defective in tumor suppression. Some
of these mutations were probably selected to maintain p53 activity at low temperature. However,
other significant changes in the axolotl proteins may play more subtle roles on p53 functions,
including DNA binding and promoter specificity and could represent useful adaptations to ensure
p53 activity and tumor suppression in animals able to regenerate or subject to large variations in
oxygen levels or temperature.

Background
Inactivation of p53 by mutations or viral oncogenes is the
most frequent alteration found in human cancers [1]. P53
counteracts the process of neoplastic transformation by
preventing the proliferation of cells with genomic abnormalities [1]. Multiple stress conditions activate p53
including DNA damage, hypoxia, redox stress, ribonucleotide imbalance, cell adhesion and oncogenes [2-5]. In
response to these signals, p53 undergoes a variety of posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation,
acetylation and sumolation, which modulate its stability
and activity [5]. The effects of p53 are mediated through
the induction of a variety of genes that have not yet been
fully characterized. These genes induce transient cell cycle
arrest, permanent cell cycle arrest program (senescence) or
a cell death program (apoptosis) [1,6].
Most of the research trying to resolve the function of p53
has been accomplished on transformed cells. However,
cell culture experiments represent only a limited perspective of the non-autonomous function of p53 as it occurs
in whole organisms. Hence, the function of p53 beyond
that observed in isolated cells remains largely a black box.
Needless to say, that the actual role of p53 in vivo is not
well understood. For these reasons researchers have
turned to the mouse as an in vivo model system to study
p53 functions [7]. The mouse system circumvents many
of the problems associated with the use of cultured cells to
study p53, but fails to model the human condition in a
number of important issues. One critical difference is the
short life span exhibited by laboratory mice. Longevity in
humans imposes a high selective pressure to develop and
refine tumor suppression pathways that might be better
studied in other long living animal models. In addition,
p53 null mice are surprisingly normal [8]. The longevity
factor is also of importance considering the ability of p53
to promote aging in mice even while increasing cancer
protection [9]. For these reasons, knowledge of the p53
pathway in other animal models may contribute critical
insights into its biological functions.
So far, p53 has been characterized in several mammalian
species where its biology follows more or less what is
known in mice and humans [10]. However, selective pressures associated to certain life styles may modify the properties of p53 and its signaling pathway. For example, the
Israeli mole rat (Spalax) who lives in hypoxic conditions
does not activate p53 in response to hypoxia [11,12]. In
addition, ground squirrels have lower levels of p53 in
their nucleus during hibernation in comparison with animals during the hot summer season [13]. The discovery of
p53 in model organisms such as Drosophila and C. elegans
revealed that p53 evolved in connection with the regulation of apoptotic pathways in response to DNA damage
[14,15]. Since these animals do not develop tumors, the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/180

p53 tumor suppressor functions probably evolved later in
evolution. Unfortunately, little is known about p53 biology in non-mammalian vertebrates, where tumor suppressor functions may play an important role. P53 has
been characterized in zebrafish where its biology and
tumor suppressor functions seem to be similar to mammals [16]. In contrast, a recent study in rainbow trout cells
seems to indicate that p53 is not up-regulated following
exposure to chemotherapeutic drugs [17]. Altogether,
these studies reveal a surprising adaptive capability of the
p53 system to different life styles and suggest that more
interesting variations are still to be found in nature.
In the present study, we used the Mexican salamander,
axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum), which is a diploid
urodele amphibian with: a remarkable longevity (up to 25
years in captivity) [18]; extensive regenerative capacities
that have been known for centuries [19-22]; and resistance to tumor induction [23,24]. Urodele amphibians
have been used for tissue regeneration and cancer resistance studies for which many authors have established
links between the ability to regenerate and the resistance
to cancer observed in these animals [23-28]. Since p53 is
a tumor suppressor that can influence the rate of aging
and modulate regeneration in both mammals and Drosophila imaginal discs [9,29,30], we reasoned that a long
living animal such as the axolotl may teach us lessons on
how the p53 system is properly modulated to ensure a
long life span, tissue regenerative capacity and efficient
tumor suppression. Here, we show that p53 signaling is
required for limb regeneration, by using a specific pharmacological inhibitor that has been shown to block p53
signaling in both mammals and zebrafish [31,32] and we
also present the cloning and initial characterization of
p53 in axolotls. We discuss the unique properties of the
axolotl p53 sequence compared to both short living
(mice, flies) and long living species (moles, humans). By
understanding the evolutionary changes that have
occurred in genes such as p53, we may be able to understand better why mutations in this gene cause neoplasia
[16] and how it can mediate tissue regeneration [33].

Results
Requirement of p53 signaling for limb regeneration
We have used the small molecule inhibitor pifithrin alpha
(pifithrin-α) to block the action of p53 during the process
of limb regeneration in axolotls [31,32,34-36]. Pifithrin-α
was administered at the time of amputation, directly in
the water that axolotls are kept in, at a final concentration
of 5 μM (a concentration demonstrated to be specific for
p53 inhibition [35]). Control animals were administered
a volume of DMSO corresponding to the volume for pifithrin. Limb regeneration was monitored at regular intervals until the control treated limbs had completely
regenerated (25 days). The pifithrin-α treated animals dis-

played a significant inhibition in the regenerative process
as seen in figure 1. Animals treated with pifithrin-α displayed normal growth compared to control treated size
matched animals which indicates that the effects of pifithrin-α were not due to general toxicity (table-1).
Axolotl p53 protein, sequence comparison and phylogeny
We cloned the axolotl full-length p53 cDNA by a combination of PCR and cDNA library screening approaches.
The axolotl p53 protein (GENBANK accession number
DQ848588) has an open reading frame of 387 amino
acids with significant sequence similarity to the human
p53 protein (Figure 2A–B). Functional domains of the
axolotl p53 protein that correspond to the human protein
sequence can be readily identified, namely the N-terminal
domain (transactivation domain (residues 1–53 of the
human protein), proline rich domain [37] (residues 60–
92), the DNA binding domain (residues 80–301), the
tetramerization domain (residues 316–347), and the Cterminal regulatory domain (residues 352–388) [38].

The critical residues for protein stability and protein-protein interactions in the N-terminus corresponding to serine 15 and serine 20 are conserved. Since these residues
are the target of p53 regulation by phosphorylation in
response to DNA damage, they suggest that axolotl p53 is
also activated by DNA damage inducing stress. The residues F19, W23 and L26, important for the binding of
Mdm2, are also present [39]. Furthermore, regions I of the
transactivation domain as well as regions II-V of the DNA
binding domain (II-IV-V bind to SV40 T Antigen) can be
easily distinguished [40] (Figure 2B). Several residues
present in the tetramerization domain of p53 proteins
such as: E326, G334, E339, M340, N345, L348, and L350
are conserved as well (Figure 2B) [41]. Finally, it is possi-

ble to observe the NLS (Nuclear Localization Signal, residues 296–314) and the NES (Nuclear Export Signal,
residues 332–343) (Figure 2B) [42].
We compared the sequence of the axolotl protein with the
database of p53 mutants [43]. We found 38 amino acid
changes in the axolotl protein that corresponded to mutations present in human cancers or affect protein stability
or modify sites of importance for post-translational modifications (table-2 which also contains scorecons [44]).
They include the sites frequently mutated in human cancers: T155, V157 and R283. Noticeable the changes T155A
and V157L are common to human p53 mutant proteins
and axolotl p53. On the other hand, the residue R283 was
found substituted for Lysine in axolotl, a change that abolished DNA binding for the human protein [45].
We also compared the sequence of axolotl p53 with that
of Spalax, the newt, Xenopus and the human. We found
that R174 present in human is substituted by a lysine in
Spalax, newt, Xenopus and axolotl. K174 in Spalax is
believed to be linked to a reduced ability of p53 to induce
apoptosis [11]. In human tumors, R174 has been found
mutated into several different amino acids including
lysine [46,47]. In vivo analysis, in a yeast model of p53
transactivation performed at 30°C, showed that p53K174
was able to transactivate several p53 promoter-reporters
similar to wild type p53 [48].
Given that R174K mutation was not a unique sequence
feature of axolotl p53, we conducted a sequence alignment of the p53 from several vertebrates spanning mammals to fish (human, mouse, rat, Spalax, chicken, axolotl,
Xenopus, barbel & zebrafish) to identify the changes in
table-2 that are unique to the axolotl p53. We found that
the changes T155A, D186N, L188D, D207M & D228G
represented positions for which a non-conservative
change was present only in the axolotl (additional file 1).
Notably the changes A189S, D208N & G262E were
unique to the axolotl.
We used our new axolotl sequence and many already published p53 protein sequences from vertebrates to construct a maximum likelihood based phylogenetic tree (35
sequences and 280 unambiguously aligned amino acid
positions). The phylogenetic tree of p53 is in general
agreement with the known vertebrate phylogeny (Figure
3). Intriguingly both rodents and fishes were clearly
divided into two groups in the p53 phylogeny.
The taxonomic distribution is strongly biased in favor of
mammalian (22 sequences) and ray-finned fish (eight
sequences). The four Neoteleost fish are evolving very rapidly resulting in artefactual basal position. This long
branch attraction artefact is induced by the distantly

a pronounced acceleration observed for the mice-like

the sequence of the already mentioned mole rat Spalax.
There also seems to be a rough inverse correlation
between the evolutionary rates inferred for the p53

positions inferred by the program Treefinder with a
WAG+Γ8 model. Numbers at internal nodes are corresponding to bootstrap support values, obtained in the analysis of 100 replicates using the same program and model of
sequence evolution. Due to the dense species sampling
within the mammals interesting aspects of mammalian evolution are becoming apparent. There are clear differences in
the evolutionary rates among the different groups, indicated
by the branch length of the rooted tree, this is especially true
for the four Neoteleost fish. There is also an acceleration
observed for the mouse-like rodents, with a striking exception represented by the sequence of the mole rat Spalax,
which is despite the fact of being a rather small rodent even
more slowly evolving than the related rabbit (Oryctolagus, lagomorph). In fact the only sequences among the tetrapods
(amphibians, reptilian and mammalian) that are more slowly
evolving than the one from Spalax are from the urodeles
(axolotl and newts). The primary sequence of salamander
p53 is more closely related to the ancestral protein of tetrapod vertebrates than the p53 proteins of any other of the
studied groups.

sequences and the longevity of the species i.e. the faster
the rate the shorter the life span. This is evident for all
mice-like rodents and the guinea pig except Spalax. This is
further supported by the observation that the rather big
and long-living organisms, human and Beluga whale,
have some of the shortest branches within the mammals
(Figure 3). We decided to test the significance of the differences in the evolutionary rates especially with respect to
the model organisms, i.e. human, mice, Spalax and axolotl

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/180

by applying a Relative Rate Test (RRT) implemented in the
program RRTree [49]. It is well known that the significance level is strongly influenced by the distance of the
outgroup, i.e. the closer the outgroup sequence the better
is the sensitivity of the RRT. We decided to compare
within the mammals the Euarchontoglires (here Primates,
Rodents and Lagomorphs) Spalax and Human against the
mouse-related group of rodents (six sequences) with the
chicken as a distant outgroup and the Beluga whale (Laurasiatheria) as a close outgroup. The RRT were giving the
following probabilities (p < 0.05 is significant) for Spalax
versus mouse-related rodents, Beluga whale p = 0.000 and
Chicken p = 0.042 and for human versus mouse-related
rodents, Beluga whale p = 0.002 and Chicken p = 0.135.
Therefore, the observation that Spalax is more slowly
evolving is significantly supported by the RRT for both
comparisons. However, note the strong dependence of
the p-value on the chosen outgroup. For human, only the
test with the close outgroup is significantly supported. If
we applied the same test to compare the evolutionary rate
of axolotl with the one of Xenopus with the fish and
amniotes as outgroup, the outcome was not significant (p
= 0.310). This is likely due to the fact that the sensitivity
of the test is highly reduced in absence of a close outgroup. The phylogenetic analysis shows that the urodele
p53 sequences are among the slowest evolving ones and
are therefore closer to the ancestral p53 protein of tetrapods. Bayesian inference also yielded similar results (data
not shown) which further substantiate the results of the
phylogenetic analysis presented in figure 3. Unfortunately, because of the lack of p53 sequences in non-mammalian vertebrates, there were only good conditions for
the relative rate within mammals and could therefore not
provide reliable information for the evolutionary rate of
the axolotl sequence in comparison to other amphibians.
Thus, we have to exclude any potential correlation with
the longevity of the species until more sequences become
available.
Axolotl p53 can activate the transcription of human p53 target
promoters in human cells
The amino acid substitutions found in the axolotl p53
protein sequence raises questions about its ability to recognize and regulate human p53 target genes. To investigate this issue, we used a Dual-Luciferase Reporter assay in
the human p53 deficient cell line H1299. We co-transfected either human or axolotl p53 expressing plasmids
with luciferase reporter constructs fused to the human
Hdm2 and p21 promoters. We performed these assays at
three different temperatures (37°C, 30°C and 25°C) for
two main reasons. First, two changes present in the axolotl
protein have been reported to cause the human protein to
become temperature sensitive (M160T & A189S, Figure
2B and table-2) [50]. Second, the p53 protein from Xenopus laevis was shown to be temperature sensitive, and also

which rendered the human protein ts [51].
Human p53, as expected, stimulated the Hdm2 promoter,
at 37°C. However, the axolotl protein was relatively inactive at this temperature (Figure 4A). In contrast, at 30°C,
we observed that the human p53 stimulated the Hdm2
promoter by a factor of 24 fold and that the axolotl p53
stimulated a similar increase of 17 fold (Figure 4B). Further reduction of the temperature to 25°C shifted the
activity pattern on the Hdm2 promoter. At this temperature the axolotl protein was twice as active as the human
p53 protein (Figure 4C). Thus, for the Hdm2 reporter, the

human p53 is more active at 37°C and less active at 25°C
while the axolotl p53 activity is less active at 37°C and
more active at 25°C.
On the p21 promoter luciferase reporter, human p53
stimulated 28 folds the activity at 37°C, 10.5 folds at
30°C and 1.6 folds at 25°C (Figure 4D–F). When the
axolotl p53 was assayed, we observed an increase of 1.7
fold at 37°C, an 8.9 folds increase at 30°C and 1.5 fold
increase at 25°C. The peak activity of the axolotl p53 on
this promoter seems to be near 30°C as opposed to 37°C
for the human p53 protein. However, at any given temperature the ability of axolotl p53 to activate the p21 pro-

moter was compromised compared to the Hdm2
promoter. Among the amino acid substitutions of the
axolotl protein that may explain this reduced activity for
the p21 promoter we noticed the change of Ser 37 to Ala
(Table-2). Substitution of Ser 37 for Pro has been detected
in a T lymphoblastoid cell line that is drug resistant. This
mutant has a reduced activity on both the p21 and the p53
promoter [52].
Next we assayed the human and the axolotl p53 together
to activate the Hdm2 promoter luciferase reporter at
37°C. We noted a decrease in the expression of luciferase
when the axolotl protein was transfected together with the
human protein compared with the human p53 alone (Figure 4G). Hence, the axolotl p53 seems to have a dominant
negative effect on the activity of the human p53 on the
Hdm2 promoter at 37°C, suggesting that they can interact
together.
To have an idea of the functionality of axolotl p53 on a
biological assay, we transfected H1299 cells with constructs driving the expression of human p53, axolotl p53
or an empty vector. As expected from the luciferase assays,
axolotl p53 did not reduce colony formation of H1299
cells, while human p53 had a dramatic inhibitory effect in
this assay (Figure 4H). Contrary to the promoter-reporter
assays which were performed 24 h post-transfection, we
could not assay p53 functions for colony formation at
30°C and 25°C in these cells because they did not efficiently attach to the plate at those temperatures for the
required amount of time to select with puromycin (7
days). Together, these results are consistent with the idea
that axolotl p53 is a temperature sensitive protein.
The capacity of the axolotl p53 protein to induce endogenous p53 target gene was also tested in the p53 deficient
human H1299 cells. The H1299 cells grown at 30° transfected with the axolotl protein had elevated Hdm2 expression (Figure 5). We also took advantage of this assay to
confirm the specificity of the pifithrin-α to block the activity of the axolotl p53 protein (Figure 5).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/180

there was a two-fold increase with the human p53 and 1.9
fold increase with axolotl p53 protein (Figure 6B). Again,
it seems that the DNA binding specificity of the axolotl
protein is different than the human counterpart.
DNA damage and activation of axolotl p53
Since p53 activity has been shown to be modulated by
close to 50 post-translational modifications on the protein itself, we decided to look at a specific phospho-serine
residue following different treatments. We used the axolotl cell line AL1 [53] to assess the effect of ultraviolet irradiation on axolotl p53 levels and phosphorylation.
Western blots were performed against phospho p53 ser15 on axolotl AL1 cells exposed to UV radiation or the
alkylating agent (N-methyl-n-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine;
MNNG) which causes DNA breaks [54,55]. The cells
exposed to UV showed an increased phosphorylation of
p53 at serine 15 in comparison to the non-exposed control cells (Figure 7A). We noticed that anti-p53 antibodies
recognized two bands that followed the same induction
pattern in response to DNA damage. These bands may
represent alternatively spliced p53 isoforms as described
in mammals [56]. The availability of the axolotl ortholog
for Gadd45 allowed us to look at the induction of an
endogenous p53 target gene following UV irradiation of
axolotl cells [57,58]. The capacity of pifithrin-α to block
p53 signaling was also tested. Axolotl cells exposed to UV
irradiation showed an up-regulation of Gadd45 expression, which was significantly inhibited in the presence of
pifithrin-α (Figure 7B). Treatment with MNNG (10-5M)
also increased p53 phosphorylation at serine 15. The signal increase for phospho p53 ser-15 was detectable one
hour after drug application and up to 24 hours later (Figure 7C). On the other hand, an antibody against "total"
p53 (CM5) was used on Western blot analysis to determine total protein levels in AL1 cells exposed to UV and
to MNNG and showed no increase in expression (Figure
7D–E). These results suggest that the axolotl p53 activity
is regulated by post-translational modifications in cells
exposed to UV and MNNG.

Discussion
Axolotl p53 activation in axolotl cells
The axolotl AL1 cell line was used for the subsequent dualluciferase reporter assay to measure the activity of human
p53 and axolotl p53. The assays were done at 25°C since
axolotl cells are unable to grow at 37°C or 30°C. The
Hdm2 and p21 reporter genes were used for the assays.

With the Hdm2 promoter, there was a 12.6 fold increase
with human p53 protein and a 26.4 fold increase with the
axolotl p53 protein (Figure 6A). Therefore, the axolotl
p53 protein activity was significantly more efficient than
the human protein at 25°C (p < 0.001) on the Hdm2 promoter in axolotl cells. In contrast, with the p21 promoter,

The p53 sequences of lower vertebrates (amphibians and
fishes) that have been identified to date are quite divergent from their mammalian counterparts. However, they
all conserve the basic domain organization described for
human p53. We investigated the axolotl p53 protein for
various reasons: First, this is a well characterized lower
vertebrate that has been used as a model organism for
over 100 years; second, axolotls display a remarkable
resistance to cancer [23,26,27,59,60]; and third axolotl is
long living, up to 25 years in captivity [18]. We are interested to determine to which extent p53 biology in axolotls
is linked to their remarkable ability to regenerate lost tissues and their cancer resistance.

are consistent with the newly reported role of p53 requirement for regeneration of both axons in mice and imaginal
discs in drosophila [29,30]. Then, we cloned the axolotl
full-length p53 sequence and compared it to that of other
species, in particular human, and the naked mole rat
Spalax. We found an overall conservation of the p53 functional domains as described for mammals. However, we
also found interesting amino acid changes, many of
which are unique to the axolotl (see Additional file 1).

with pifithrin-α grown at 30°C. RT-PCRs were also performed with the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh) to control for the amount of
total RNA.
To address these questions, we tested whether p53 signaling was required for limb regeneration. The administration of pifithrin-α blocked the process of limb
regeneration therefore providing evidence that p53 signaling is required for regeneration in axolotls. These results

in AL1 cells with Hdm2 and p21 promoters at 25°C. All Luciferase activities were significantly different from non-p53
controls (at least p < 0.05, data not shown). Error bar ±
s.e.m. human and axolotl p53 induced luciferase expression
were significantly different with the Hdm2 promoter (p <
0.01). Each assay was performed in triplicate at least 3 separate times.

First, the axolotl p53 was largely inactive at 37°C, which
can be explained by the presence of two changes in amino
acids (M160T & A189S) that have been shown to cause
the human protein to become temperature sensitive [50].
Also, the residue at position R174 in the human sequence
is changed to lysine in the axolotl. We noticed a similar
substitution in Spalax, Xenopus and the newt. In the
model of human tetrameric p53 bound to the DNA, R174
does not contact the DNA and it was proposed that it
interacts with R181 in an adjacent monomer [11]. The
neighboring R175 mediates interactions between the
loops that contact the DNA and may stabilize the core
structure of the DNA binding domain [61]. Mutation in
R175 to histidine makes DNA binding by p53 temperature sensitive [62]. Mice expressing R175H-p53 revealed
not only a dysfunctional protein but also gain of function
activities such as the ability to have a dominant negative
effect on wild type p53 and other p53 family members
such as p73 [63,64].
Another interesting change is the T155A which we found
is unique to the axolotl (Additional file 1). This position
is one of the most frequently mutated in human cancers.
However, the transactivation ability of the T155A protein
on several promoters is not significantly disabled by this
mutation and it is doubled on the Noxa promoter [48]. In
addition, phosphorylation of T155 by the COP9 signalosome targets p53 for degradation by the proteasome [65]
and disruption of the COP9 signalosome Csn2 subunit
results in a hyperactivation of p53 [66]. These results suggest that the axolotl protein may be resistant to degradation allowing the protein to accumulate and therefore
could confer cancer resistance. In agreement with this
hypothesis, mice expressing extra-copies of p53 are also
cancer resistant [67].
We also studied the response of axolotl p53 to DNA damaging agents such as UV light and an alkylating agent.
These results clearly indicate that p53 is activated following UV irradiation in axolotl cells as reported in human
cells [68]. Also, our time course experiments showed an
increase in phospho-ser15 p53 in axolotl cells treated
with 10 μM of MNNG. Our data clearly confirms that p53
is activated in salamanders through similar mechanisms

as described for mammalian cells under similar conditions.
Multiple p53 codons are found mutated in human cancer
and many of them have been tested for transactivation,
induction of growth arrest or apoptosis. However, combinations between different individual mutations have not
been systematically studied, mainly because their number
is obviously too large. The discovery of a natural p53 variant containing a combination of mutations found in
human cancers is a rich source of structural data for fundamental studies about p53 and represents a window to
understand how certain selective pressures modify the
structure and the function of p53. For example, the p53
protein from Spalax was unable to regulate several promoters of pro-apoptotic p53 targets and it was suggested

that this trait is an adaptation to hypoxic life [11]. It is
interesting to speculate that changes we have found in
axolotl are the result of selective pressures linked to the
life style of this animal, including its ability to regenerate
lost tissues.
In conclusion, our results present for the first time the p53
system in axolotls and open the way to study whether this
interesting protein is linked to the remarkable traits that
have evolved in these amphibians. Further characterization of p53 in these animals may shed light into the evolutionary adaptations of the p53 tumor suppressor
pathways to different physiological conditions and the
potential relationships with the aging/cancer process.

Methods
Animal procedures
Axolotls (Ambystoma mexicanum) were purchased from the
Axolotl colony (Ambystoma Genetic Stock Center, Lexington KY). Larvae were maintained at 20–22°C in 40%
Holtfreter' solution. Animals (2.5–4 cm) were anaesthetised in 0.1% MS222 solution for amputations through
both the upper (proximal) and lower (distal) part of the
forelimbs to induce regeneration. Pifithrin-α (SigmaAldrich) was dissolved in 100% DMSO at a concentration
of 5 mM. Pifithrin-α was administered by adding directly
to the Holtfreter's solution to the desired concentration
(at least 9 animals were treated with 5 μM); treatment was
started at the time of amputation. The control animals
were treated with the same 100% DMSO that was used to
dissolve the pifithrin-α. All solutions were changed daily
until the controls had completely finished regenerating
their limbs (25 days post-amputation). Animals were
euthanized at the end of the experiment.
Cell lines
H1299 (p53-null lung cancer cell line) and IMR90
(human Caucasian fetal lung fibroblast) cell lines grown
in culture were maintained at a constant temperature of
37°C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium
(DMEM with 1× L-glutamine, 1× penicillin-streptomycin
and 10% Fetal Bovine Serum) (Gibco, Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA). Axolotl cells (AL1) were obtained from Dr.
S.V. Bryant and Dr. D.M. Gardiner at the University of California Irvine. AL1 cells grown in culture were maintained
at a constant temperature of 25°C without CO2 in Leibovitz's L-15 medium (L-15 60.0% with 1× L-glutamine, 1×
antibiotic-antimycotic, 1× insulin-transferrin-selenium
and 5% Fetal Bovine Serum) (Gibco, Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA).
Cloning and sequence analysis of axolotl p53 cDNA
Partial axolotl p53 cDNA sequences were cloned by RTPCR using degenerate primers [partial axolotl p53 forward
(DFPROP53)] 5'-GG(A/C/G/T)(C/T)T(A/C/G/T)GC(A/
C/G/T)AA(A/G)ACITG(C/T)CC-3' and [partial axolotl
p53 reverse (DRPROP53)] 5'-G(G/T)(A/G)TTCAT(G/
T)CC(G/T)CCCAT(A/G)CA-3'. To obtain the full length
p53 gene, we performed a screening of Salamander Larvae
Lambda cDNA Library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), with the
partial p53 cDNA sequence obtained. The open reading
frame of the p53 protein was identified after sequencing
several cDNA isolates from the library (4 different isolates). Two primers with a restriction site on each side
(5'Xho1 and 3'BstX1) were made to facilitate the cloning
of full length axolotl p53 in the FG12/CMV vector (M.
Soengas, Ann Arbor). Full length p53 cDNA was subsequently amplified by PCR using [axolotl p53 forward
XHO (APFXHO)] 5'-GAGCCTCGAGGAATCGGAAACCACCATGGA-3' and [axolotl p53 reverse BSTX (APRB-

primers. PCR reactions were performed using Taq DNA
polymerase (Invitrogen, USA). All PCR products were
purified by Rapid gel extraction (Gibco), cloned into the
pCR 4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, USA) and sequenced by
the McGill Genome Sequencing Centre with M13R and
M13F primers. Resulting sequences were assembled using
SeqManII (DNASTAR Inc., USA). All sequences were analysed on the NCBI BLAST database (axolotl p53 GENBANK sequence accession number: DQ848588).
Transfection of human cells and dual luciferase reporter
assay
H1299 cells were transfected at a confluence of 90% in 6
wells plates, with 2.5 μg of the firefly luciferase reporter
plasmid (p21 waf-1-luc or Hdm2 in pGL3 vector;
Promega), 0.5 μg of a plasmid expressing either human
p53 (pLPChp53 containing the CMV promoter), axolotl
p53 (FG12/CMV-Ap53) or FG12/CMV as control. A plasmid expressing Renilla luciferase under the β-globin promoter was co-transfected (0.5 μg) to normalize the results
of the assays. Transfection was done with lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen, U.S.A.) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. H1299 cells were incubated at different temperatures (37°C, 30°C or 25°C) following transfection.
24 hours after transfection H1299 cells were rinsed with
Hank's buffer and harvested with trypsin (Invitrogen,
CA). They were resuspended in 200 μl of fresh passive
lysis buffer (Promega), vortexed, frozen in liquid nitrogen
and stored at -80°C. Luciferase assay was performed following the standard protocol for the Dual-Luciferase®
Reporter Assays System (Promega, Madison, WI). The
assays were read on a Fusion α-FP luminometer (Packard
Instrument Company, Inc., Meriden, CT). For the experiments combining the human and axolotl p53 we used 0.5
μg of plasmids expressing human and axolotl p53 (or
FG12/CMV for control), 2.5 μg of the firefly luciferase
reporter plasmid (Hdm2 in pGL3 vector) and 0.5 μg of
plasmid expressing Renilla luciferase under the β-globin
promoter.
Electroporation of axolotl cells and dual luciferase
reporter assay
An electroporation protocol was developed to transfect
the AL1 cells for the Dual Luciferase® Reporter Assay. Cells
were co-transfected with 5 μg of the firefly luciferase
reporter plasmid (p21 waf-1-luc or Hdm2 in pGL3 vector;
Promega) and with 1 μg of a plasmid expressing either
human p53 (pLPChp53), axolotl p53 (FG12/CMV-Ap53)
or empty FG12/CMV as control. The same plasmid
expressing Renilla luciferase under the β-globin promoter
(1 μg) was used to normalize the results of the assays. The
transfection was performed using a Gene-Pulser Xcell
Eukaryotic System (Bio-Rad) generating a single electros-

quare pulse of 250 volts during 35 milliseconds, in a 4
mm cuvette (VWR) containing approximately 60 000 AL1
cells resuspended in 100 μl of ice cold 0.7× PBS. 48 hours
after electroporation, axolotl cells were rinsed twice with
0.7× PBS, lysed with 250 μl of fresh 1× passive lysis buffer
and placed on a shaker with gentle agitation for 20 minutes. The cells were collected, frozen in liquid nitrogen
and stored at -80°C. Luciferase assays were performed as
described above.
RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from either H1299 cells of axolotl AL1 cells using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA). Reverse transcription reactions were done at 50°C
using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The
cDNA fragments encoding for the human Hdm2 (Genbank # CO783557) and the axolotl Gadd45 (Genbank #
NM_002392) were amplified by RT-PCR from total RNA
with the following primers: Hdm2 forward CAGCTTCGGAACAAGAGACC,
reverse
GAAGCCAATTCTCACGAAGG; Gadd45 forward CGTGCACCTTACTTGGGACT,
reverse ATGTCATTGTCGCAGCAAAA. Gapdh and EF1-α
were used as control PCR using the following primers:
human Gapdh forward ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC,
reverse TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA and for the axolotl
EF1-α forward AACATCGTGGTCATCGGCCAT, reverse
GGAGGTGCCAGTGATCATGTT, and Gapdh forward
GACAAGGCATCTGCTCACCT and reverse ATGTTCTGGTTGGCACCTCT. RT-PCR reactions were performed on
at least 3 separate RNA preparations.
Colony assays
The H1299 cells used for the colony assays were transfected with lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. The pLPChp53, the FG12/CMV-Ap53
or the FG12/CMV empty vectors (12 μg) were co-transfected with a puromycin resistant vector (12 μg, pBabelacZ) for colony selection. The colony assay was performed 1 week post-transfection at 37, 30 and 25°C in
DMEM. The selection was made with 1 μg/ml of puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich, St-Louis, MO). Colonies were colored
with crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich, St-Louis, MO).
Immunoblots
AL1 cells used in western blotting were exposed to UV
(100 j/m2) using a XL-1000 UV Crosslinker (Spectronics
Corporation, NY, USA). AL1 cells were harvested 6, 12
and 24 hours post-irradiation. Total proteins of axolotl
cells were extracted by sonication in sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) sample buffer. AL1 cells used in western blotting were also treated with MNNG (1-methyl-3-nitro-1nitrosoguanidine, Sigma-Aldrich, St-Louis, MO), during
1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours, then harvested post-treatment.
Total proteins where prepared by sonication as mentioned above. The protein quantification was done using

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/180

the Bradford technique [69]. 40 μg of cell proteins were
denatured by boiling and loaded on 10% polyacrylamideSDS gels following the Laemmli method [70]. Proteins
were then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride
membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA).
Anti-Pp53 ser15 (#9284, Cell Signaling technology, MA)
and Anti-p53 CM5 (NCL-p53-CM5p, Novo Castra laboratory, UK) rabbit affinity isolated antibodies were used to
detect axolotl p53. Immunodetection of primary antibodies was visualized using the ECL Western blotting kit
(Amersham Pharmacia, Amersham, United Kingdom) or
Lumi-light Western Blotting Substrate (Roche) following
manufacturer's guidelines. Anti-α-tubulin (Tubulin-α Ab2 clone DM1A, Neo Marker distributed by Medicorp, Qc)
was used as loading control. IMR90 cells were used as a
positive control for normal expression of p53 protein.
Sequence handling and phylogenetic analyses
All protein sequences were retrieved from NCBI GenBank
after identification by a BLASTP search, with the salamander p53 protein sequence as query (except for the newt
(Notophthalmus viridescens) p53 sequence which was the
generous gift from Dr J. Brockes University College London). Clustal V was used to create the original alignment
that was manually further optimised and redundant
sequences were discarded using the edit option of the
MUST package. G-blocks was used to eliminate variable
regions of the alignment. The maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was inferred by the program Treefinder using
the WAG matrix of amino acid replacement under the
assumption of four discrete gamma-distributed rates. The
statistical robustness of internal nodes was estimated by
the bootstrap method, based on 100 replicates using the
same program and model as before. The consensus tree of
these 100 bootstrap replicates was generated with the consense option of the PHYLIP package. The bootstrap support values given in percent are indicated on the
corresponding nodes.
Statistics
Statistics for the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System
were performed with SysStat® (Systat Software Inc, USA).
One-sample t-test was used to calculate the p-value
between control and experimental assays. A two-sample ttest was used to calculate the p-value between experimental assays in same condition. Graphics were made with
Origin® (OriginLab Corporation, USA).

Analysis of the changes in aa of the axolotl p53 protein compared to the
p53 proteins of multiple vertebrates. This is a supplement to table-2 where
we show that 38 aa positions known to be mutated in p53 from human
cancers are changed in the axolotl as well. Most of these positions are also
changed in the p53 from other vertebrates, however we highlighted in yellow positions that are only changed in the axolotl at aa A189S, D208N
& G262E. We also highlighted in blue the positions where only the axolotl
showed a non-conservative aa change (T155A, D186N, L188D, D207M
& D228G). The data presented in this figure was generated by the pairwise alignment of the human p53 protein sequence with the protein
sequence of each organism. The position number refers to the aa position
in the human p53 protein. Gaps in aa sequence alignment are represented
