Abstract
Background: Root and bulb vegetables (RBV) include carrots, celeriac (root celery), parsnips (Apiaceae), onions,
garlic, and leek (Alliaceae)—food crops grown globally and consumed worldwide. Few data analysis platforms are
currently available where data collection, annotation and integration initiatives are focused on RBV plant groups.
Scientists working on RBV include breeders, geneticists, taxonomists, plant pathologists, and plant physiologists
who use genomic data for a wide range of activities including the development of molecular genetic maps,
delineation of taxonomic relationships, and investigation of molecular aspects of gene expression in biochemical
pathways and disease responses. With genomic data coming from such diverse areas of plant science, availability
of a community resource focused on these RBV data types would be of great interest to this scientific community.
Description: The RoBuST database has been developed to initiate a platform for collecting and organizing
genomic information useful for RBV researchers. The current release of RoBuST contains genomics data for 294
Alliaceae and 816 Apiaceae plant species and has the following features: (1) comprehensive sequence annotations
of 3663 genes 5959 RNAs, 22,723 ESTs and 11,438 regulatory sequence elements from Apiaceae and Alliaceae plant
families; (2) graphical tools for visualization and analysis of sequence data; (3) access to traits, biosynthetic
pathways, genetic linkage maps and molecular taxonomy data associated with Alliaceae and Apiaceae plants; and
(4) comprehensive plant splice signal repository of 659,369 splice signals collected from 6015 plant species for
comparative analysis of plant splicing patterns.
Conclusions: RoBuST, available at http://robust.genome.com, provides an integrated platform for researchers to
effortlessly explore and analyze genomic data associated with root and bulb vegetables.

Background
In the present decade, rapid advancements in DNA
sequencing and molecular genetics techniques have generated a wealth of plant genomics, genetics, and breeding data. Whole genome sequences of several plants
(arabidopsis, rice, wheat, grapes, etc) are now available
and the sequencing of a number of additional plants is
ongoing (lotus, papaya, cassava, tomato, potato, etc).
The rapid proliferation of plant genome annotations
generated by these efforts has led to the development of

several data analysis platforms focused on specific plant
groups - Gramene for grass genomics [1], SOL Genomics Network (SGN) for solanaceae [2], Legume Information System for legume species [3], GrainGenes for
Triticeae and Avena [4] and GDR genome database for
Rosaceae [5] are some examples. These resources integrate genomic sequence data, genetic maps, and phenotypic data associated with specific plant groups into a
single user friendly platform and encourage researchers
to get involved in annotation efforts. Such integrated
repositories of plant group-specific data with active
community contributions can greatly aid researchers in
gaining a deeper understanding of plant genetics, plant
taxonomy, plant pathology and plant physiology, and are

valuable tools for supporting research initiatives focused
on addressing challenges confronted in agriculture.
Interestingly, most of the plant data analysis platforms
available today are focused on plant groups with high
economic value and are associated with data collection
from genome sequencing projects. Very few data analysis tools are available for less-studied “minor” and
“orphan” crops with no ongoing genome sequencing
efforts. Integrated data collection and annotation platforms focused on specific orphan crop families would be
invaluable for researchers working on these crops.
Root and bulb vegetables (RBV) represent one such
group of orphan crops [6,7]. These include carrots, celeriac (root celery), parsnips (Apiaceae), onions, garlic,
and leek (Alliaceae, sometimes referred to as the Allioideae subtribe Amaryllidaceae) - food crops common to
virtually all agricultural regions and consumers’ plates
around the world. Yet the community of plant scientists
working on RBV crops is small, perhaps as small as 10
to 25 full-time equivalent scientists in academic and
government programs worldwide devoted to each of
these crops. Most of this effort comes from breeders,
geneticists, taxonomists, plant pathologists, and plant
physiologists. A similar level of effort also comes from
seed companies worldwide [8,9]. Yet even with a relatively small scientific community, genomic data is
becoming increasingly more abundant, primarily from
efforts to develop molecular genetic maps, delineate
taxonomic relationships and investigate molecular
aspects of gene expression in biochemical pathways and
disease response. With genomic data coming from such
diverse areas of plant science, availability of a database
focused on these root and bulb vegetable crop data
would be of great interest to this small scientific
community.
Plants that form storage roots and bulbs are included
in several web sites that have a taxonomical or regional
focus. For example, turnip and rutabaga are included in
the Eurpoean Brassica Database [10], yacon (Smallanthus sonchifolius), a member of the Asteraceae, and
wild yam (Dioscorea villosa), a member of the Dioscoraceae, are included in the Tropical Plant Database [11].
Databases of the latter type rarely include genomic
information. Furthermore, databases such as the SOL
Genomics Network [2] include tuber-bearing species
and genomic data for this plant family but comparable
databases that focus on storage root or bulb-forming
plants have not been developed. While the Apiaceae and
Alliaceae include many species that do not form storage
roots or bulbs, many wild and domesticated species in
these two plant families do.
The RoBuST database has been developed for initiating a platform to collect and organize genomic information useful for genetics, breeding, taxonomy, plant

physiology and other data highly relevant to root and
bulb vegetables. The current release of RoBuST provides
a comprehensive collection of sequence annotations of
genes, RNAs, proteins, splice signals, regulatory elements and ESTs belonging to two root and bulb orphan
crop families—Alliaceae and Apiaceae. RoBuST also has
a unique data collection of Alliaceae/Apiaceae-specific
gene function and trait annotations, molecular taxonomy data, genetic linkage maps, markers and biosynthetic pathways as well as an exhaustive collection of
plant splicing data. A variety of sequence analysis and
visualization tools are available in the RoBuST web
interface for the integrated analysis of these diverse data
sets.

Construction and content
Database and web interface development

The RoBuST database was developed in MySQL 4.1.The
RoBuST web interface was developed using the CGI.pm,
DBI.pm and GD.pm modules of Perl (5.8.8), and runs
on an Apache (2.0.53) web server. Graphical display of
genes, RNAs, intron-exon structures, splice junctions,
and alternative splicing patterns were implemented in
RoBuST using Gene Plot, Splice Signal Plot and AS Plot
modules from the EuSplice [12] project. Additional graphical modules to display regulatory elements and other
sequence elements were developed specifically for
RoBuST using GD.pm.
Extraction of sequence annotations

Sequence records of Alliaceae and Apiaceae plant
families were downloaded from GenBank [13] by submitting batch queries to its Entrez web interface. Gene,
mRNA and other sub-sequence annotations are presented in a pre-determined data structure under the
Feature Table section of GenBank records with each
sub-sequence elements described as Feature Keys [14].
We carefully analyzed the Feature Table structure and
developed Perl programs to parse the Feature key data
format and efficiently extract sub-sequence datasets.
The Perl programs extracted position co-ordinates,
sequences and additional annotations associated with
each of following sequence data types: (1) Gene, (2)
RNA, (3) CDS (4) EST, (5) Promoter, (6) Regulatory elements (Signal Peptide, Replication Origin, 5’UTR,
Enhancer, TATA Signal, CAAT Signal, -10 Signal, -35
Signal, PolyA Signal, PolyA Site, Protein Bind, 3’UTR),
(7) Repeat elements (Repeat Region, Repeat Unit, Transposons) and (8) Miscellaneous elements (Misc Feature,
Precursor RNA, Prim Transcript, Mature Peptide, Primer Bind, Misc Signal, Stem Loop, Variation, Misc
RNA, Transit Peptide). The extracted sequence and
annotation data were populated into the back-end
MySQL database.

Extraction of plant splicing data

Table 1 Distribution of sequence data types in RoBuST

Plant-specific annotation data files ("gbpln*.seq.gz”) were
downloaded from GenBank and all GenBank gene
records which belong to plant species from Kingdom
Viridiplantae were extracted. Since we were interested
in splice signal information, all single-exon gene records
were removed from this data set. This left 348,081 GenBank records covering 6015 Viridiplantae plant species,
each of which had multi-exon gene annotations. These
were further parsed to extract position coordinates and
sequences associated with gene, mRNA, exon and intron
structure, and donor and acceptor splice signals.

We submitted seventeen new carrot and garlic trait

Ontology Consortium [15]. All seventeen were accepted
into TO and were assigned TO IDs and parent-child
relationships. We implemented a hierarchy-based display
of TO term lineage for these traits in the RoBuST Trait
Ontology viewer using GraphViz [16].
We successfully mapped Gene Ontology (GO) [17]
function annotations to 119 RoBuST genes as follows:
InterPro [18] IDs corresponding to RoBuST genes were
extracted from the database cross references (db_xrefs)
provided under the CDS feature key tag in their corresponding GenBank files. The GO annotation file “interpro2go” was downloaded from InterPro and InterPro
IDs associated with each of the 119 genes were mapped
to the gene ontology information available in this file.

Sequence Annotations

RoBuST provides a comprehensive platform for integrated visual analysis of various types of sequence annotations from 294 Alliaceae and 816 Apiaceae plant
species. This includes genes, mRNAs, tRNAs, rRNAs,
ESTs, splice signals, promoters, regulatory elements, signal peptides, transposons, molecular taxonomy
sequences and several additional types of sequence elements (Table 1). Users can access sequence annotations
of interest using keyword or ID-based search options
available in the web interface.
Gene and RNA sequence annotations can be visualized as graphical plots in RoBuST’s results page. The
graphical plots allow users to zoom in and efficiently
analyze exons, introns, splice signal sequences, splice
junctions as well as translated and untranslated regions
using color-coded display and pop-up options, and integrate all related information in one place without browsing away from the main result page. Users can also view
the alternative transcription initiation (ATI), alternative
splicing (AS), and alternative transcription termination
(ATT) events in genes with multiple transcript isoforms.

Numbers of entries for major categories of Alliaceae and Apiaceae sequences
are indicated.

The graphical plots also display regulatory elements
such as promoters, polyA, mature peptides, signal peptides, and all other sequence element types found within
the gene or RNA sequence (Figure 1A).
The results page also has several informational tabs
which provide additional data on the gene or RNA of
interest. The “Summary” tab provides general information on the sequence record such as gene/RNA name
and description, organism name, GenBank Accession/ID
and links to the original GenBank record. The
“Sequences” tab, provides options to download sequences
of gene, RNA, coding sequence (CDS), protein and other
sequence annotations (promoters, ESTs, regulatory elements, repeat elements etc). If a gene has an exon-intron
structure, then the splice signal sequences of each of its
splice junctions can be viewed by clicking on the “Splice

Sequence Analysis Tools

RoBuST supports the diverse sequence analysis requirements of Alliaceae/Apiaceae research community by

integrating the following sequence analysis tools to its
user-friendly web interface. (1) Customized access to
plant family-specific and species-specific BLAST [23]
searches; (2) Primer Design Tools: Primer3Plus [24] and
ExonPrimer3—a customized version of Primer3 which
we developed so that users can design specific primers
for exons from any Alliaceae or Apiaceae gene; (3)
Emboss [25] pair-wise sequence alignment tools: Water

Bhasi et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:161

for local alignment and Needle for global alignment; (4)
Emboss open reading frame detection tool: Getorf; (5)
VecScreen [26] for detecting vector contamination; (6)
Splign [27] and Spidey [28] for exon-intron structure
detection and splicing analysis.
Plant Splice Repository (PSR)

A comprehensive collection of annotated plant splice
signals can be a valuable tool for analyzing splicing
mechanisms in plants. For this purpose, we have created
the Plant Splice Repository (PSR)—unique collection of
plant-specific splicing data associated with 6015 plants
species belonging to 443 plant families extracted from
GenBank plant sequence records. PSR currently contains
659,369 donor and acceptor splice signal pairs (Figure 2)
and is a valuable resource for comparison and analysis
of splicing patterns in plants.
PSR can be mined to retrieve splicing annotations associated with an entire plant family, a specific plant species
or even a specific gene of interest (Figure 1B). For any
given gene, users can view its exon-intron structure, analyze donor and acceptor splice signals, exon and intron

(PSR).

sequences flanking splice junctions as well as access the
distribution of putative splice signals surrounding annotated splice junctions. Users can also download these
gene-specific PSR datasets for further analysis.
PSR also has two unique splicing analysis tools which
support in-depth mining of the extensive splicing data
content. SpliceBlast-PL (Figure 1C) identifies potential
plant-specific exon-intron structures within a query
sequence of interest by aligning the query sequence
against the entire plant splice signal collection in PSR
and SpliceMatch-PL (Figure 1D) can be used to identify
the prevalence of a splice signal sequence of interest
within various plant genomes. It accepts user-submitted
splice signal sequences as a query and retrieves hits in
different plant species which have this same splice signal. Each of these hits can be analyzed in detail using
graphical splice signal plots.
Genetic Linkage Maps

Linkage maps play an important role in plant genetics
and genomics and are highly valuable resources for the
genome analysis of plant species which do not have
whole genome sequencing data and hence do not have
any physical maps available. Genetic linkage maps can be
updated when maps from several studies are consolidated. While several genetic linkage maps are available
for different Alliaceae and Apiaceae species, they are
spread across various publications or are maintained as
an internal collection by research groups for their own
specific analysis and hence are not available in one place
where external users can access and analyze them. Our
effort in RoBuST is to create a centralized repository for
all Alliaceae and Apiaceae genetic linkage maps, each of
which are linked to information on its specific mapped
markers. As part of that effort, we have currently added
12 linkage maps: 8 for carrot, 3 for garlic and 1 for onion
into RoBuST (Table 2). These maps can be accessed and
viewed through the cMap viewer [29] deployed on the
RoBuST server. Users can browse through genetic maps,
view marker data, and search for specific markers of
interest. Graphical comparison between different genetic
maps can also be performed and this functionality can be
used to generate a single comparative view of multiple
maps of interest, to analyze common markers and to
conduct comparative analysis of the loci of interest
(Figure 1E). We encourage and invite members of the
Alliaceae and Apiaceae research community to submit
additional linkage maps and annotations and be active
participants in developing a complete collection of linkage map data for these two plant families.
Biosynthetic Pathways

enzymes catalyzing the reaction, links to the RoBuST
records of pathway genes, genetic linkage map details
for these genes, and 2D molecular structure of the pathway elements is available in the pathway display page.
We plan to incorporate additional pathways from Alliaceae/Apiaceae species and welcome submissions from
the research community to enhance the current
collection.
Plant Taxonomy and Systematics

DNA sequences have become a standard tool used by
plant taxonomists [30]. Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS)
is often the first sequence used to evaluate and classify
plants by species, but a widening array of genic regions is
also being used. It is becoming recognized that a single
sequence does not discriminate accurately among species
of a genus, so sequence information from several different regions are now becoming widely accepted as markers for taxonomic classification in plants. Since there is
a growing need for the Alliaceae and Apiaceae research
community to have direct access to family-specific molecular taxonomy sequences, we have parsed and extracted
phylogenetic markers (e.g., ITS1 & ITS2, Non Transcribed Spacer (NTS), External Transcribed Spacer
(ETS)) and “barcoding” genes (e.g., matK) associated with
Apiaceae and Alliaceae families from GenBank sequence
data. Table 3 gives the distribution of some common
molecular taxonomy sequences in RoBuST. This collection of 9837 molecular taxonomy sequences is a valuable
reference resource for intergeneric/intra-generic and

interspecies/intra-species level taxonomy analysis and
classification efforts.
Trait Ontology and Gene Ontology Browsers

We have implemented an ontology browser for exploring functional annotations and trait features of Alliaceae
and Apiaceae plants. Gene Ontology (GO) functional
annotations for 43 Alliaceae and 76 Apiaceae genes can
be accessed and analyzed in the GO annotation browser
in RoBuST (Figure 1G).
For traits, we used the well-established Trait Ontology
(TO) collection for defining carrot and garlic trait
terms. Each carrot trait which matched existing TO trait
terms was mapped to their specific TO ID and TO
annotation. Since several carrot and garlic trait definitions were not available in TO, we submitted these new
trait definitions to Trait Ontology. This resulted in the
addition of 17 new trait terms to the TO collection
(Table 4).
Trait and functional annotations can be queried
through the ontology browser using general keyword
searches or by specific searches using ontology terms or
accession IDs. Users can view complete information for
each ontology term as well as parent and child terms
and their relationships (Figure 1G).
Future Directions

We plan to expand the current data coverage in
RoBuST in the future, and develop it into a one-stop
resource for the root and bulb research community by
providing comprehensive coverage of genomic data for
all available root and bulb plant species. Since comparative analysis of genomic data from tuber forming plants

and root and bulb plants could prove useful for understanding common mechanisms of bulb and tuber formation, we plan to link genomic information on tuberbearing species from SGN to RoBuST. We will also
incorporate interactive tools that can be used by root
and bulb researchers to annotate sequences, phenotypes
and traits, and to submit linkage maps, markers, molecular phylogeny data, pathways and other relevant data
types which are of interest to the user community.
Additionally, several comparative genomics tools will be
made available in the next release of RoBuST and these
tools will allow user-friendly cross-species comparative
analysis of sequence annotations not only within the
root and bulb plant group, but also against well annotated genomes such as rice, wheat, arabidopsis, barley,

grape, potato and tomato. Since inter-database comparative analysis would be very useful in plant genome analysis and knowledge discovery, we will implement link
integration of RoBuST data to Gramene and Ensembl.
We will also provide gateways to ExDom [31] a database
resource that will enable the comparative functional
analysis of proteins and domains from these genomes.
Furthermore, we will enable the capability for analyzing
mutations in genes, RNAs and regulatory sequences in
RoBuST using the EuSplice resource [12] and comparative analysis of alternative splicing events using the
AspAlt resource [32].
Since the current sequence data in RoBuST is from a
single data source—GenBank, we did not have data heterogeneity issues in this version release. However, we
will be faced with data heterogeneity when we expand
the RoBuST content to include data from different databases like SGN, Gramene and Ensembl in the next version release of RoBuST. To address this, we will adapt
DAS protocols [33] in RoBuST and set up a DAS server
which will make the import and export of data easy.
This will ensure that RoBuST’s future development and
updates are not complicated by diverse data formats and
data heterogeneity from different data sources.

Trait ontology terms added for Alliaceae and Apiaceae are listed.

Conclusion
The plant research community in agriculture often has a
commodity-specific focus. Consequently, the availability
of detailed information from diverse scientific disciplines
has long been of interest to crop scientists. As genomic
data is the common language of all biological disciplines, a focused collection of genomic data for an individual plant species or family provides a valuable tool
for researchers specializing in particular crops. This fact
led to the development of GrainGenes, SolGenes, etc.
To this end, RoBuST has been developed for plant
scientists working on root and bulb vegetable crops.

The array of genomic information on these relatively
poorly studied plants is not extensive but even today
over 47,000 GenBank sequence records have been generated for Apiaceae and Alliaceae alone. With the recent
advancements in next generation sequencing technology,
an increase in genomic data for root and bulb orphan
crops in public databases is imminent. Furthermore,
there is little doubt that the whole genome of one or
more species in Apiaceae will be sequenced in the next
few years, especially since many species in this family
have genomes in the size range of rice and tomato. The
extraordinarily large size of Alliaceae genomes will
impede their whole genome sequencing projects, but
that fact notwithstanding, much more sequence information of Alliaceae will certainly be generated. With the
certainty that next-generation sequencing will become a
common research tool, the management of these large
sequence datasets is receiving much attention by genomicists. Discussion of next-generation plant genetics is
already underway [34] and similar strategies are being
planned for use in plant taxonomy and physiology. We
anticipate that specialized databases like RoBuST will
become even more valuable for crop specialists as the
database grows. While RoBuST assembles tools useful
for genomics of root and bulb vegetables, it also provides tools to tie genomic data to genetic linkage data,
plant traits and biochemical pathways of interest to
geneticists, taxonomists, and physiologists, and it creates
links to other related databases. This collection of features provides a network for communication from the
DNA sequence level to the trait and crop level with
relative ease. The tools assembled in RoBuST are
intended to be of wide immediate interest to researchers
working on root and bulb crops, and to also serve as a
model of assembling diverse comparable data useful for
any crop.
