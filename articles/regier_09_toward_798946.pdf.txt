Abstract
Background: In the mega-diverse insect order Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths; 165,000
described species), deeper relationships are little understood within the clade Ditrysia, to which
98% of the species belong. To begin addressing this problem, we tested the ability of five proteincoding nuclear genes (6.7 kb total), and character subsets therein, to resolve relationships among
123 species representing 27 (of 33) superfamilies and 55 (of 100) families of Ditrysia under
maximum likelihood analysis.
Results: Our trees show broad concordance with previous morphological hypotheses of ditrysian
phylogeny, although most relationships among superfamilies are weakly supported. There are also
notable surprises, such as a consistently closer relationship of Pyraloidea than of butterflies to most
Macrolepidoptera. Monophyly is significantly rejected by one or more character sets for the

putative clades Macrolepidoptera as currently defined (P < 0.05) and Macrolepidoptera excluding
Noctuoidea and Bombycoidea sensu lato (P ≤ 0.005), and nearly so for the superfamily
Drepanoidea as currently defined (P < 0.08). Superfamilies are typically recovered or nearly so, but
usually without strong support. Relationships within superfamilies and families, however, are often
robustly resolved. We provide some of the first strong molecular evidence on deeper splits within
Pyraloidea, Tortricoidea, Geometroidea, Noctuoidea and others.
Separate analyses of mostly synonymous versus non-synonymous character sets revealed notable
differences (though not strong conflict), including a marked influence of compositional
heterogeneity on apparent signal in the third codon position (nt3). As available model partitioning
methods cannot correct for this variation, we assessed overall phylogeny resolution through
separate examination of trees from each character set. Exploration of "tree space" with GARLI,
using grid computing, showed that hundreds of searches are typically needed to find the bestfeasible phylogeny estimate for these data.
Conclusion: Our results (a) corroborate the broad outlines of the current working phylogenetic
hypothesis for Ditrysia, (b) demonstrate that some prominent features of that hypothesis, including
the position of the butterflies, need revision, and (c) resolve the majority of family and subfamily
relationships within superfamilies as thus far sampled. Much further gene and taxon sampling will
be needed, however, to strongly resolve individual deeper nodes.

Background
The Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) are one of the
four mega-diverse insect orders, containing over 165,000
described species [1,2]. Primarily plant-feeding as larvae
and nectar-feeding as adults, they are a prominent element of terrestrial ecosystems, functioning as herbivores,
pollinators and prey, as well as constituting one of the
most damaging groups of pests overall to agriculture. Lepidoptera have served as important model systems for studies of genetics, physiology, development, and many
aspects of ecology and evolutionary biology including
insect/plant coevolution [3]. As conspicuous terrestrial
invertebrates, they have become central as well to ecosystem assessment, conservation planning, and public outreach designed to foster environmental awareness [4].
A phylogenetic framework is fundamental to all attempts
at understanding the diversity, adaptations and ecological
roles of Lepidoptera. Deep-level lepidopteran phylogeny,
however, remains largely a mystery, except in the speciespoor, basal ("non-ditrysian") lineages (review in [3]).
Monophyly seems well established for many of the 47
superfamilies but not for all, and phylogeny within superfamilies has only begun to receive concerted study. Relationships among superfamilies have rarely been
examined. In the clade Ditrysia, which contains over 98%
of lepidopteran species and 80% of the families, the most
authoritative phylogenetic hypothesis to date postulates
only 11 tentative monophyletic groupings among the 33
superfamilies [1], and is not based on a quantitative phylogenetic analysis.

In this paper we present an initial study undertaken to
help guide the design of a very large molecular investigation of lepidopteran phylogeny now in progress (700+
exemplars, 5-26 genes; see http://www.Leptree.net/). We
test the ability of five protein-coding nuclear genes (6.7 kb
total) to resolve relationships among 123 species, drawn
from 27 superfamilies and 55 families that together contain nearly 90% of the species of Ditrysia. We then compare the results to previously postulated relationships,
most of which are based on morphology. This report
presents by far the largest explicit character-based analysis
of ditrysian phylogeny yet published, though others are
underway (L. Kaila, personal communication; see http://
www.leptree.net/community_directory).
The working hypothesis that our sampling is designed to
test is the compendium of expert opinion on within- and
among- superfamily relationships compiled by Kristensen
[5]. The major divisions follow Minet [6], who recognized
three successively more restricted clades within Ditrysia.
In order from most to least inclusive, these are Apoditrysia, Obtectomera, and Macrolepidoptera. These divisions,
based on morphological characters, are correlated with
broad postulated trends in life history [7,8]. For example,
in most non-ditrysian and many primitive ditrysian lineages, the larvae typically live and feed inside the host
plant, most often as leaf miners, emerging, if at all, only to
pupate. In the majority of non-macrolepidopteran
Apoditrysia, the larvae live outside the plant but construct
and feed within shelters such as silk webs or leaves rolled
and tied with silk. Only in the putative clade Macrolepidoptera, comprising the butterflies and larger moths and

totaling about 100,000 described species in 33 families
and 11 superfamilies, do the larvae - "caterpillars" - typically feed exposed on the leaf. Macrolepidoptera also differ from the remaining Ditrysia, often referred to
informally as "Microlepidoptera," in that over 80% of the
species, mainly in the superfamilies Drepanoidea,
Geometroidea, and Noctuoidea, possess some form of
ultrasound-detecting "ears," most often located on the
thorax or abdomen. These hearing organs probably
evolved as a defense against bats that hunt using sonar [9].
Among the microlepidopterans, in contrast, the only large
superfamily to possess such "ears" is Pyraloidea, though
similar structures have been described in two other small
groups [10,11]. Rigorously documenting (or disproving)
the existence of such major transitions and their evolutionary consequences is a central long-term goal of our
studies of lepidopteran phylogeny.
The early radiations of ditrysian superfamilies are likely to
have been rapid [2], and to have taken place mainly during the Cretaceous [12], a problematic time span for insect
molecular phylogenetics (e.g., [13]). Cretaceous divergences are sufficiently young that most coding sequences,
even ones chosen specifically for suitability over this time
span, have accumulated relatively few amino acid
changes. Thus, many genes will probably be needed to
provide sufficient non-synonymous signal to resolve a
rapid radiation. At the same time, these divergences are
sufficiently old that sites undergoing synonymous substitutions, the largest source of signal, will be both
approaching saturation and diverging in base composition, posing special difficulties for phylogeny inference.
Resolution of ditrysian relationships is thus likely to
require, in addition to very large character sets, an especially careful choice among analytical methods, to extract
the maximum amount of signal from a highly heterogeneous and challenging set of relevant characters. For this reason, our study included extensive exploration of the
differing properties and phylogenetic signal content of
different character subsets. We focus particularly on the
distinction between sites undergoing non-synonymous
versus synonymous substitution, and on the computational effort required to extract full information from
these.

Methods
Taxon sampling and specimen acquisition
Complete coverage of the lepidopteran families and
superfamilies, many of which contain just a few, difficultto-collect species, is beyond the reach of this initial study.
Our more modest aim here was simply to represent a
majority of the probable major lineages of Ditrysia. The
distribution of our exemplars across the major clades of
Minet [6] is shown in Additional file 1, which also lists
families/superfamilies not sampled, to illustrate the
extent of our coverage. Our sampling, which builds on a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/280

preliminary study of macrolepidopteran (especially bombycoid) relationships [14], is most dense in Macrolepidoptera (66 exemplars; 11 of 11 superfamilies) and nonmacrolepidopteran Obtectomera (17 exemplars; 4 of 6
superfamilies), which together contain about 70% of ditrysian species diversity. Thirty species of non-obtectomeran Apoditrysia are included, representing eight of
eleven superfamilies, and seven species of non-apoditrysian Ditrysia representing four of five superfamilies. One
of the latter, Tineoidea (two species included), was used
to root the tree, as tineoids are generally agreed to be the
oldest superfamily of Ditrysia [1,6,15]. We sampled relatively extensively within a few larger superfamilies, both
to get an adequate estimate of ancestral character states,
and to further test the resolving power of our genes within
superfamilies; our main focus, however, is among-superfamily relationships. Altogether our sample includes 27 of
33 superfamilies and 55 of 100 families of Ditrysia. The
six superfamilies not represented each contain fewer than
100 species. The missing families are likewise mostly species poor, the main exceptions being Lycaenidae and several large families of Gelechioidea. Thus, the families
represented in our study contain the great majority
(>85%) of all species of Ditrysia. The classification system
used (Additional file 1) follows the authorities in Kristensen [5], with exceptions as noted, including the following: in Pyraloidea we follow the more recent classification
of Solis and Maes [16]; in Geometridae we update the
classification following Hausmann [17], Holloway [18],
Scoble [19] and Young [20].
Specimens for this study, obtained with the kind help of
collectors around the world (see Acknowledgements) are
stored in 100% ethanol at -85°C as part of the ATOLep
collection at the University of Maryland (details at http://
www.leptree.net/collection). DNA extraction used only
the head and thorax for most species, leaving the rest of
the body including the genitalia as a voucher (see Additional file 1). Wing voucher images for all adult exemplars
are posted at http://www.leptree.net/voucher_image_list,
and DNA 'barcodes' for nearly all specimens have been
kindly generated by the All-Leps Barcode of Life project
http://www.lepbarcoding.org/, allowing check of our
identifications against the BOLD (Barcode of Life Data
system) [21] reference library and facilitating future identification of specimens whose identity is still pending (i.e.,
species listed as 'sp.' or 'unidentified' in this report).
Gene sampling and generation of DNA sequence data
matrices
Our sequence data come from five protein-coding nuclear
gene regions, identical to those used by Regier et al. [14],
with demonstrated promise for resolving deeper lepidopteran relationships. The combined length of these regions
after alignment is 6867 nucleotides (nt) per taxon, or
6759 if 108 characters (1.6% of total) around indel
Page 3 of 21

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:280

regions are excluded because of uncertain alignment. The
five sequences are: CAD (2928 nt; contributes 43% of
total sequence in this study) [22], DDC (1308 nt; 19% of
total) [23], enolase (1134 nt; 17% of total) [24], period
(987 nt; 15% of total) [25], and wingless [26] (402 nt; 6%
of total).
Why choose these genes and exclude markers more commonly used in Lepidoptera? We used protein-coding
regions rather than ribosomal RNA sequences because
they are easier to align and their sequence evolution is easier to model. We used nuclear rather than mitochondrial
protein-coding genes because the faster evolution of the
latter, and their extreme base composition bias, render
them less suitable for recovering deeper divergences [27].
For the same reasons, we did not include the "barcode"
fragment of mitochondrial CO-I in our analyses. We did
not sequence EF-1 , the nuclear protein-coding gene most
often studied in Lepidoptera, because in comparisons
between superfamilies, synonymous substitutions in this
gene approach saturation, while amino acid changes are
too few to provide much information [28]. We used RT
(Reverse Transcription)-PCR, instead of the more standard genomic DNA PCR, to avoid amplification of introns.
This increases the efficiency of obtaining coding
sequences, which are easier to interpret than introns and
likely to carry on average more information on deeper
divergences than introns. We intend no criticism of previous uses (including our own) of genes and gene regions
excluded here, which have yielded countless valuable
results at lower taxonomic levels. Rather, our present
choice of markers was motivated simply by the goal of
obtaining as much information about deeper relationships as possible from the finite resources available for
this project.
A detailed protocol of all our laboratory procedures has
been published ([30]; see online Appendix 2 therein).
Further descriptions, including gene amplification strategies, PCR primer sequences, and sequence assembly and
alignment methods, can be found in previous papers
([14,29,30]; see online supplementary materials therein).
To summarize, total nucleic acids were isolated and specific regions of the cognate mRNAs were amplified by RTPCR. Specific bands resulting from RT-PCR were gel-isolated and reamplified by PCR using hemi-nested primers,
except for wingless, which lacks nested primers. Visible
bands that were too faint to sequence were reamplified
using the M13 sequences at the 5' ends of all primers. PCR
amplicons were sequenced directly on a 3730 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Sequences were examined,
edited and assembled using the TREV, PREGAP4, and
GAP4 programs in the STADEN package [31]. Multiple
sequence alignments were made manually in Genetic
Data Environment [32], and a data-exclusion mask of 108

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/280

nucleotides was applied. Alignment was generally
straightforward, given the overall conservation of the protein sequences. The entire aligned data matrix in Nexus
format is available in Additional file 2: "Data matrix".
GenBank numbers as well as genes and taxa for which
sequences are partial or missing are listed in Additional
file 1.
Congruence among genes
Most of our analyses were based on the maximum likelihood criterion applied to nucleotides, as implemented in
GARLI (Genetic Algorithm for Rapid Likelihood Inference; version 0.951) [33]. We selected the best-fitting substitution model (invariably GTR+ G + I) under the Akaike
information criterion (AIC), using Modeltest version 3.7
[34]. To determine whether conflicting signal among
genes might significantly complicate phylogenetic analysis, we first conducted a bootstrap analysis (1000 pseudoreplicates) for each gene separately (all nucleotides), looking for groupings that conflicted moderately or strongly
(bootstrap support of 70% or more) with other individual
genes, with the all-gene result, or with conventional
understanding of relationships. The results are presented
and discussed in Additional file 3. Only two such conflicts
were found, one previously reported [14], both of which
involved within-family relationships. Given the rarity of
inter-gene conflict, we felt justified in concatenating all
five genes into a single data set for estimating the organismal phylogeny.
Character sets differing in synonymous versus nonsynonymous change
While heterogeneity among genes does not appear to
present a major obstacle to analysis of these data, variation among sites within genes is potentially a larger problem. Most phylogeny reconstruction methods for
nucleotides, including those used here, assume that the
relative rates of different nucleotide substitution types
(i.e., the instantaneous rate matrix) are constant across the
tree, and can be led astray if this assumption is violated.
In our experience [14,29], strong compositional heterogeneity, an indicator of underlying process heterogeneity, is
common at sites capable of undergoing synonymous substitution. For this reason, we explored several character
sets which differ strongly in the likely proportion of synonymous change. In a subsequent section (see below) we
compared compositional heterogeneity among character
sets and its possible consequences.

To create a character set essentially free of synonymous
change, we first isolated from the total population of first
codon position sites (nt1) a subset which we term
"noLRall2," containing all sites belonging to codons in
which no more than one leucine or arginine occurred
among the taxa considered. Since only leucine (L) and

Page 4 of 21
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:280

arginine (R) codons can undergo synonymous change
through a single nucleotide substitution at nt1, variation
in the "noLRall2" subset should reflect mostly non-synonymous change. Combining noLRall2 with second codon
position sites (nt2) produces a character set we term
"noLRall2 + nt2," which should contain most of the total
signal from non-synonymous change. The "noLRall2"
subset of nt1 contributes 150 more sites to the non-synonymous category than does the similarly-motivated
"noLR1" subset of Regier et al. [14], which excluded all
sites at which even one leucine or arginine occurs. The nt1
subsets were generated using a Perl script available in
Regier et al. ([29]; see online Appendix 4 therein). As a
more conventional estimate of predominantly non-synonymous signal we also analyzed nt1 + nt2 alone. As an
estimate of almost entirely synonymous signal we first
analyzed nt3 alone. A second, larger set of mostly synonymous change was then obtained by combining nt3 with
a character set we call "LRall2", which is the complement
to "noLRall2" above. That is, "LRall2" consists of nt1 sites
at which either leucine or arginine (or both) occur in two
or more taxa, opening the potential for those taxa to differ
by synonymous substitutions. Analysis of all nucleotides
together (nt123) provides a third data set dominated
(>90%) by synonymous change.
Tree space and the efficacy of ML searches
For reasons developed in the Discussion, we spent considerable effort on obtaining the best possible tree estimate,
as well as gauging bootstrap support for that estimate. We
first sought to gain some idea of how many heuristic
searches might be required to consistently obtain an optimal or near-optimal tree. To this end, we first ran 10,000
GARLI searches on each character set, using the default
search parameters. We regarded the best-score resulting
tree(s) from this very large effort to represent the best
topology that it is feasible to obtain with our computing
resources. While we have no way of knowing whether this
is actually the globally best tree, the chance that it is so
increases with the number of times the same topology is
recovered in 10,000 trials.

To determine how many replicates to include in subsequent searches, we used the number of times (N) the "best
feasible" topology appeared in the 10,000 replicate
searches to estimate how many search replicates would be
needed to be 95% confident of getting the "best" topology
at least once. In other words, for what number of replicates would the chance of never getting the "best" topology be only 5%? From the formula probabilities under the
binomial distribution, that number can be expressed as x
in the equation (1-N/10,000)x = 0.05, where N is the
number of trials, among the 10,000 trials, that yielded the
best-score topology. Estimates of the number of runs
needed ranged from about 40 to nearly 15,000, depend-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/280

ing on the character set. For all subsequent analyses of
each data set (see below), we used the number of GARLI
runs thus specified for estimating the optimal topology.
Node support for each character set was gauged by performing 1000 bootstrap replicates under default search
parameters. For consistency in the characterization of
results, we will refer to bootstrap support of 70-79% as
"moderate" and support ≥ 80% as "strong."
We also used the results of the 10,000 heuristic searches
for each data set to explore the nature of tree space in the
vicinity of the best feasible topology. To gauge the tightness of clustering around the best tree, we computed the
topological difference from the best topology for each of
the 10,000 trees, defined as the number of nodes collapsed in its strict consensus with the best tree. This is a
variant of the consensus fork index of Colless [35]. We
also examined the frequency distribution among the
10,000 trees of departure in likelihood score from the best
score, expressed as a percent of the best score, and looked
for a relationship between topological difference and likelihood score difference.
The total number of GARLI runs for the entire study
amounted to about 100,000. To make this large effort
possible we used grid computing [36] through The Lattice
Project [37], which includes clusters and desktops in one
encompassing system [38]. A grid service for GARLI was
developed using a special programming library and associated tools [39]. Following the model of Cummings et al.
[40,41], we distributed required files among hundreds of
computers, where the analyses were then conducted asynchronously in parallel.
Bayesian analysis
Although analyzing character sets separately can help elucidate the evolutionary properties of each, for phylogeny
inference one would ideally analyze complementary character sets simultaneously, taking into account the different
substitution behavior of each. GARLI does not yet allow
data partitioning under the GTR + G + I model. For this
reason, we also performed a Bayesian analysis, with the
full data set (nt123) partitioned into site populations
undergoing largely non-synonymous (noLRall2 + nt2)
versus largely synonymous (LRall2 + nt3) change. This
analysis used MrBayes (version 3.2; parallel processing
enabled) [42,43]. Default values were used for the prior
probability distribution of the parameters of the likelihood model (GTR + I + G), except that the rate multipliers
of the character sets were specified to be variable. For all
character sets the gamma shape parameter, proportion of
invariable sites, character state frequencies, and substitution rates of the GTR + G + I model were unlinked. The
Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis was run for 111 million generations, and samples were taken every 1000 gen-

erations. The analysis consisted of two simultaneous,
independent runs with four chains, and samples from the
two runs were pooled for the final result. All samples were
taken after the two runs had converged, as indicated by a
standard deviation of split frequencies smaller than 0.01
and diagnostic analyses implemented in AWTY [44]. Convergence was first seen in the 92 millionth generation.
Testing significance of non-monophyly of predicted
groupings
Several groupings proposed in the composite working
hypothesis [5] were non-monophyletic in all of our analyses. We used the Approximately Unbiased (AU) test of
Shimodaira [45] to determine whether our data or subsets
thereof significantly reject those previous hypotheses,
against the alternative that the discrepancy can be
explained by sampling error in the sequence data. The test
determines whether the best tree possible under the constraint of monophyly, no matter what its topology may be
otherwise, is a significantly worse fit to the data than the
best tree without that constraint. Table 1 lists the eight
groups tested for significance of non-monophyly. For
each combination of one character set and one group of
uncertain monophyly, we performed a GARLI analysis
under the constraint of monophyly for the group in question, and a parallel unconstrained analysis. Each analysis
used the number of GARLI runs determined to be appropriate for that character set as described above. The site
likelihoods of the resulting best constrained tree and best
unconstrained tree were then estimated with PAUP* [46],
and the trees and site likelihoods for all comparisons
combined into a single input file for the CONSEL package

[47]. In CONSEL, the test statistic of Shimodaira [45] was
used to determine the difference in fit to data of the constrained and unconstrained trees, and the bootstrapping
procedure of Shimodaira [45] was used to determine the
significance of those differences.
Base composition heterogeneity and its consequences
One of the most difficult problems that can affect molecular phylogenetic inference is among-lineage heterogeneity in nucleotide base composition [48]. To investigate the
potential influence of compositional heterogeneity in our
character sets, we first conducted chi-square tests of
among-taxon heterogeneity on a character set undergoing
mostly non-synonymous change, noLRall2 + nt2, and on
a character set undergoing mostly synonymous change,
nt3. In each case, the test was performed both on the
entire character set, and after elimination of invariable
sites in that character set. To gauge the level of taxonomic
divergence over which compositional heterogeneity
becomes apparent, we carried out these tests both for all
taxa together and for 13 taxon subsets (families, superfamilies or related sets thereof). To explore the possible
consequences for phylogeny inference of the compositional heterogeneity revealed by these tests, we compared
neighbor joining trees computed from three distances that
are influenced to different degrees by compositional heterogeneity: (a) LogDet distances, which are relatively
insensitive to compositional heterogeneity [49]; (b) ML
distances based on the GTR model, which can be influenced by compositional heterogeneity; and (c), Euclidean
distances calculated on the proportions of the four nucleotide states treated as independent characters, which will

reflect only compositional heterogeneity. These calculations were performed separately on noLRall2 + nt2,
nt123, and nt3. The calculations were carried out with
PAUP* [46], except that the Euclidean distances were generated using MBE Toolbox V2.2 [50], after modification of
the source code to correct for varying sequence lengths.

Results
Tree space and the efficacy of ML searches
The best-score topology occurring one or more times in a
set of 10,000 GARLI search replicates, taken here to represent the closest feasible estimate to the globally best tree,
was found with a frequency (in those 10,000 searches)
that differed markedly among data sets and appeared
inversely correlated with the prevalence of synonymous
substitutions. The "best-feasible" topology was found 925
times for the largely non-synonymous-change character
set noLRall2 + nt2, 133 for nt123, 114 times for nt12, and
only twice in 10,000 trials for nt3; change in the latter is
almost entirely synonymous. From these numbers, we
estimate (see Methods) that to be 95% confident of getting the "best-feasible" topology at least once in a new
analysis, one would need to perform 31 GARLI search replicates for noLRall2 + nt2, 224 for nt123, 264 for nt12,
and 14,978 for nt3 alone. The result for nt3 strongly suggests that our searches did not find the globally optimal
tree(s).

We also used the results of the 10,000 heuristic searches
for each data set to explore the nature of "tree space" in the
vicinity of the best tree (Fig. 1). The 10,000 GARLI trees
showed a broad range of topologies, and the differences of
these topologies from the best tree appear correlated,
across data sets, with the fraction of synonymous change
(Fig. 1, left column). For example, the topology with the
median degree of difference from the best topology (dotted lines in Fig. 1) differs from the best topology in 14 of
120 nodes for noLRall2 + nt2, 18 nodes for nt12, 24
nodes for nt123, and 40 nodes for nt3. In general, very
large numbers of trees differ only slightly in likelihood
score from the best tree, yet these trees can differ dramatically in topology (Fig. 1, right column). For example, 40%
of all 10,000 trees for nt123 have likelihood scores within
0.005% of the maximum score, yet these can differ from
the best tree at up to 30 nodes. Tree score difference is only
loosely correlated with topological difference. For example, trees for nt12 that differ in score from the best by
between 0.003% and 0.004% span a broad range of topological differences from the best tree, from five to 27
nodes not shared (Fig. 1F).
Phylogeny estimates from the four character character

The best trees found in the ML and Bayesian analyses are
shown in condensed form in Fig. 2(B-F), with each termi-

nal taxon representing a family or fraction thereof that
proved monophyletic. Support values are shown on the
branches. The Bayesian tree shown is a majority rule consensus of the trees sampled from the Markov chain process. For comparison, the expected relationships among
(only) these families under the composite working
hypothesis [1] are shown in Fig. 2A. The complete 123taxon ML tree for nt123, together with bootstrap values
for nt123, nt12 and noLRall2 + nt2, as well as Bayesian
posterior probabilities for nt123, is shown in Fig. 3. Full
ML trees in phylogram format, and bootstrap majority
rule consensus trees, are presented for all data sets in Additional files 3, 5, 6, and 7. The full 123-taxon majority-rule
consensus of trees sampled during the Bayesian analysis,
with associated posterior node probabilities, is given in
Additional file 5.
The ML tree and the Bayesian consensus tree for nt123
were largely identical, with just five discordant nodes
(marked by §in Fig. 2C). The ML trees for noLRall2 + nt2
and nt12 were quite similar to each other, and only
slightly less so to the nt123 topologies. The nt3 topology,
in contrast, differs markedly from all the others, and will
be discussed in a subsequent section. For the ML analyses
apart from nt3, bootstrap support levels are generally high
near the tips of the trees, typically within and among
closely related families, whereas support at deeper levels among superfamilies or more inclusive clades - is very
weak, with almost no nodes reaching BP of even 50%. In
striking contrast, support at deeper levels in the Bayesian
analysis is very high, with posterior probabilities along
the "backbone" of the tree nearly all 1.0; support at shallower levels is, if anything, weaker.
Comparison of the molecular trees (apart from ML nt3) to
the morphology-based working hypothesis (Fig. 2A) can
be summarized as follows, proceeding from more-inclusive to less-inclusive groupings. On the broadest scale,
there is rough agreement with division of Ditrysia into
four successively nested clades [6], but with major exceptions. In all analyses there is a clade consisting of most but
not all of the superfamilies of Minet's Macrolepidoptera,
with membership varying slightly among data sets. For
nt123, this clade includes Geometroidea, Bombycoidea,
Lasiocampoidea, and Noctuoidea, as well as Mimallonoidea, Drepanoidea and Cimelioidea (= Axioidea); placement of the last three is variable for noLRall2 + nt2 and
nt12. In a substantial departure from expectation, however, the Pyraloidea, not traditionally considered Macrolepidoptera, are always grouped with these core
macrolepidopterans, whereas the butterflies sensu Scoble
[51] (Hedyloidea, Hesperioidea, Papilionoidea) are
always more distantly related. The exact position of the
butterflies sensu Scoble varies considerably among data
sets, but they are always separated from core Macrolepi-

doptera + Pyraloidea by at least one lineage containing
non-Macrolepidoptera. The remaining macrolepidopteran was the single representative of Calliduloidea, which
was variably placed but never grouped with core macrolepidopterans, though it sometimes grouped within
butterflies (nt123).
The other hypothesized major clades are also at best partially congruent with the molecular trees. The Obtectomera are never monophyletic, both because of the
variable position of the butterflies sensu Scoble, and
because each of the non-macrolepidopteran obtectomerans apart from Pyraloidea, i.e., Thyrididae, Hyblaeidae
and Carposinidae, is quite unstably placed, sometimes
grouping with non-obtectomerans. However, these last
three groups are also allied often (always, in the case of
Hyblaeidae) with either core Macrolepidoptera or butterflies, and in the nt12 analysis, all Obtectomera except Thyrididae and Callidulidae form a monophyletic group. In
contrast, even near-monophyly is never supported for
Apoditrysia, as the two non-apoditrysian groups
Yponomeutoidea + Gracillarioidea and Gelechioidea are
always nested (separately) within lineages that consist
otherwise only of apoditrysians.
Support is similarly variable for two smaller-scale proposed groupings of superfamilies (Fig. 2A) [6]. The
hypothesized clade consisting of butterflies sensu Scoble
plus Geometroidea, Drepanoidea, Cimelioidea (= Axioidea) and Calliduloidea is never close to monophyletic;
indeed, no subset of even two of these superfamilies is
consistently grouped together. In contrast, the proposed
grouping of Zygaenoidea + Sesioidea + Cossoidea is recovered fully by nt123, and is at least paraphyletic in trees for
other data sets, although the predicted relationship
among these superfamilies (Zygaenoidea (Cossoidea +
Sesioidea)) was never seen. The butterflies sensu Scoble
[51] were monophyletic for data sets excluding nt3. However, the widely accepted relationships among the superfamilies (Hedyloidea (Hesperioidea+ Papilionoidea))
were never recovered; the hedyloids always grouped with
the hesperioids, and these with Nymphalidae + Pieridae,
to the exclusion of Papilionidae, rendering Papilionoidea
non-monophyletic. Monophyly of the "bombycoid complex" [52] is not supported, as Mimallonoidea never
group with Bombycoidea + Lasiocampoidea. Only a single relationship among superfamilies received even moderately strong support in this study: the lone
representative of Gracillarioidea was invariably grouped
with the two Yponomeutoidea, with bootstrap support as
high as 79% (for nt12).
The ML bootstrap support for nodes corroborating or contradicting the broad groupings just discussed is typically
very weak (<< 50%). More support is evident, and congruence with previous hypotheses greater, for groupings at or

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/280

near the superfamily level. Nine previously defined superfamilies were represented in our sample by more than one
family. Monophyly was recovered in full for Pyraloidea
and Gelechioidea in all analyses, with bootstraps sometimes > 60%, and for Bombycoidea in nearly all analyses,
with weaker support. In three other cases, monophyly was
consistently supported for a group consisting of at least a
significant fraction of the families including the nominate
family, and/or a plausible re-circumscription of the superfamily, with bootstrap support most often > 50% and
sometimes > 80%. Geometroidea, if re-defined to include
Epicopeiidae (included in Drepanoidea by Minet) were
always monophyletic, though never with BP ≥ 50%. A
core subset of Zygaenoidea (Aididae, Dalceridae, Lacturidae, Limacodidae, Megalopygidae, Zygaenidae), excluding only the enigmatic, highly divergent, parasitic families
Epipyropidae and Cyclotornidae, was always monophyletic, sometimes with strong support (BP > 80%); Zygaenoidea as a whole are monophyletic in the ML nt123
analysis, albeit with weak support. Noctuoidea were
always monophyletic, with moderate to very strong support (BP = 74-99%), except that Doa (Doidae), by far the
longest-branched noctuoid exemplar, was never included.
Doa grouped weakly instead with Cimeliidae (= Axiidae)
or Drepanidae. This result was so surprising that we rechecked the identity of our Doa specimen, and reextracted and partially re-sequenced it, to rule out laboratory error. Monophyly or near-monophyly was always
lacking for three superfamilies, including Drepanoidea as
discussed above. The two families of Sesioidea, Sesiidae
and Castniidae, varied in position but always grouped
separately with other taxa, never strongly but sometimes
with BP > 50%. Papilionoidea, as we have seen, were
always paraphyletic with respect to both Hedylidae and
Hesperiidae.
The strongest resolution provided by our data lies within
superfamilies and families. Most multiply-sampled families are recovered as monophyletic by noLRall2 + nt2,
nt12 and nt123, often with very strong BP support. Apart
from Noctuidae and Bombycidae, both of which have
been previously shown to be non-monophyletic
[14,53,54], only Cossidae are consistently non-monophyletic for all three data sets, albeit without even modest
contrary bootstrap support. The nt123 analysis also fails
to recover Lacturidae. Within several of the families and
superfamilies that we sampled most extensively, including Geometridae, Pyraloidea, Noctuoidea and Tortricoidea, our results provide some of the first strong tests of
hypothesized relationships. These findings are presented
in detail in the Discussion.

ered in our trees, are presented in Table 1. This test is
especially useful for assessing the confidence we can place
in conclusions based on partial resolution of relationships, in cases such as the present one, where the data do
not unambiguously resolve most or all individual nodes
on the tree. By this test, monophyly can be confidently
rejected for the hypothesized clade consisting of butterflies sensu Scoble [51] + Geometroidea + Drepanoidea +
Cimelioidea + Calliduloidea [6], as P is less than 0.005 for
all three character sets. Monophyly of Macrolepidoptera is
rejected significantly by nt12 (P = 0.020), but not by
either noLRall2 +nt2 (P = 0.106) or nt123 (P = 0.183).
Strongly suggestive evidence is also seen for rejection of
Drepanoidea as currently defined (P = 0.077). For the
remaining five predicted groups, the data do not argue
strongly against monophyly.
Pairwise differences and rates of substitution
Uncorrected pairwise differences among all 123 species,
an approximate indicator of the prevalence of multiple
substitutions ("saturation"), are mainly in the range of
50-58% for nt3, while those at noLRall2 + nt2 are in the
range of 3-8% (data not shown). Nt3 accounts for about
90% of the total character change in the nt123 data set
under likelihood analysis, despite comprising only 33%
of the total characters (Table 2). In contrast, noLRall2 +
nt2 contributes only about 9% of total character change
despite comprising 58% of all characters. In addition to
nt3, the LRall2 character set (nt1 sites in codons specifying
leucine or arginine in two or more taxa) also can undergo
synonymous change; its average rate of substitution is

quadruple that of the remainder of nt1 characters
(noLRall2), in which synonymous change cannot be
detected.
Nucleotide composition heterogeneity and its
phylogenetic consequences
The results of chi-square tests for compositional heterogeneity are shown in Table 3. Neither for all taxa nor for any
of the 13 taxon subsets could homogeneity be rejected for
the noLRall2 + nt2 character set. Even with invariant characters (62% of total) removed, only Zygaenoidea were significantly non-homogeneous, due in part to the highly
divergent taxon Epipyropidae. In contrast, nt3 showed
highly significant heterogeneity across all 123 taxa and
within all 13 taxon subsets as well.

Compositional heterogeneity in nt3 may account for
some of the unusual properties of the ML topology
derived from nt3 alone (Fig. 2F). That tree, as noted earlier, differs strikingly from those for all other character
sets, and fails to recover a number of groupings strongly
supported both by other character sets and by morphology. For example, it breaks up the strongly-supported
families Geometridae, Uraniidae and Zygaenidae. The nt3
tree also has markedly lower support levels than those for
other data sets. Despite providing about 90% of the total
character change, the nt3 character set alone yields bootstrap support > 50% for only about half as many nodes
(25) as does the full data set (nt123; 48 supported nodes),
fewer even than the noLRall2 + nt2 character set (32 supported nodes).

More direct evidence that compositional heterogeneity
can affect trees based on nt3 alone comes from comparison of the NJ trees computed from LogDet distances,
which correct for compositional heterogeneity, to those
computed on ML distances on the GTR + G model, which
do not (trees not shown). For nt3, these two trees are very
different from each other, sharing only 51 of a possible
120 nodes. For noLRall2 + nt2, in contrast, they are quite
similar, sharing 99 of 120 nodes. The case for an influence
of composition is further supported by the Neighbor Joining analysis of pairwise Euclidean distances computed
from just the proportions of the four nucleotides in each
taxon (Additional file 8). The range of the compositional
distances themselves (largest minus smallest) is about 4.5
times greater for nt3 than for noLRall2 + nt2. The tree for
noLRall2 + nt2 tree is mostly comb-like with short
branches, consistent with prevailing compositional
homogeneity. The few distinct clusters, reflecting shared

deviation from typical composition, appear to group taxa
that are missing a relatively high proportion of data, frequently in the same gene regions. Thus, such compositional heterogeneity as is evident in noLRall2 + nt2 is
apparently due to intra- and/or inter-genic heterogeneity
coupled with differential sampling of those regions. None
of the obviously incorrect groupings (i.e., those contradicting very strong previous evidence) based on composition alone are also found in likelihood or distance
analysis based on standard substitution models. The
results of the corresponding analyses of nt123 are very
similar, providing likewise little evidence for an influence
of composition that contradicts very strong previous evidence.
The results for nt3 alone are very different. Here, groupings in the composition-based NJ tree appear to be largely
independent of missing data, reflecting instead real differPage 13 of 21

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:280

ences in mean composition among taxa. In several
instances, groups based only on composition match
clearly incorrect groupings seen in the ML tree and the NJ
tree on ML distances (see Additional files 8, 9). For example, the most derived group in the nt3 NJ tree based on
composition pairs one species of Uraniidae with one species of Geometridae, and these together with Tortricidae.
Similar though not identical groupings are seen in the NJ
tree on GTR distances, reaching bootstrap support as high
as 77% and 78%, and also in the ML tree of Fig. 2F. Thus,
it appears that in the case of nt3 alone, sufficiently aberrant composition can sometimes overwhelm true phylogenetic signal.

Discussion
In this section we first review the implications of our findings for the analysis of molecular data on deep-level lepidopteran relationships. We then review the bearing of our
results on current understanding of those relationships
themselves.
Heuristic search efficiency and computational effort
In preliminary analyses prior to those described here we
had repeated each GARLI run 20 times (20), a typical
number in applications of this program so far [14,29,30].
Surprising discrepancies between the initial tree estimates
for different character sets prompted us to wonder if these
were really the best available estimates. The ensuing,
much more extensive tree searches reported here revealed,
first, better trees for all data sets. Moreover, for all data sets
except nt3, the same best topology was found many times
(114-925, or 1.1-9.3%) in 10,000 searches, making it
plausible, though not provable, that we actually found the
global ML topology. (For nt3, for which the best topology
appeared only twice, we are less likely to have found the
global ML tree.) Also revealed by these searches were (to
us) surprisingly large sets of near-best trees, with only
slightly lower likelihood scores, yet including topologies
strikingly different from the best tree, underscoring the
limited resolving power of our data.

We tentatively conclude from these results that GARLI
analyses of data sets the size of ours should routinely
include not just tens of searches but hundreds, if one
wants to be confident of having the best feasibly obtainable tree. But, given that the differences between our initial
trees and the better ones found subsequently are very
weakly supported by any measure (see below), is the
improvement worth the large additional computational
effort? The answer is often likely to be yes, for at least two
reasons. First, some types of hypothesis tests for which
tree estimates are used do not explicitly take topological
uncertainty directly into account, thereby placing a premium on the accuracy of the input tree. For example, in
our study, the improved tree estimates generally raised the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/280

P values of the significance tests for non-monophyly of
previously-proposed groups, as compared to those based
on the initial trees found using just 20 GARLI searches
(data not shown). In 16 total comparisons, the new P
value was equal to the initial one in two, moderately to
substantially larger in ten, and smaller (slightly) in just
four. These differences were caused specifically by change
in the unconstrained tree estimates.
A second reason to value even small, hard-won improvements in likelihood score is that some problems, including ditrysian phylogeny, may be difficult enough to resist
strong resolution by any one data source for a long time
to come. In the interim, the most convincing means of
favoring one hypothesis over another may be congruence
among multiple data sets, each providing only weak support by itself. Thus, credibility is lent to the phylogeny
estimates presented here, despite their low support levels,
by the fact that very similar relationships among lepidopteran superfamilies are emerging from an independent
molecular study using a different but comparable gene
sample, and a larger taxon sample (M. Mutanen, L. Kaila,
N. Wahlberg, personal communication).
Support levels and possible reasons for low bootstrap
support at deeper levels
The overall pattern of bootstrap support in our ML analyses is that families and divergences within them are generally strongly supported; superfamilies and divergences
within them are only sometimes strongly supported; and
relationships among superfamilies almost always have
very weak support, with bootstraps often < 20% (see
Additional files 4 and 7).

Why is support along the "backbone" so low? There are
several possibilities. First, given the extensive search
needed to find the best feasibly-obtainable ML trees, low
ML bootstrap support at deeper levels might be thought to
reflect insufficient effort - a single GARLI search - on each
pseudo-replicate. Search effort surely has some effect on
bootstrap efforts, but we doubt that it is the main explanation. The literature on per-replicate search effort
required for accurate bootstrap percentage estimation
[55,56], while limited thus far to parsimony analyses, suggests that a plateau in mean BP is quickly reached as one
increases heuristic search effort from simplified fast methods to somewhat more elaborate methods (e.g. limited
branch swapping) to full standard search methods (e.g.,
those incorporating extensive branch swapping). It further suggests that the plausible prediction of increased BP
with more thorough searches is realized mainly for BP values which were low to begin with. Preliminary experiments included in our initial analyses (data not shown)
point in the same direction: very low initial BP values
sometimes increased substantially (up to 20-30% in abso-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:280

lute value) with increased search effort per pseudo-replicate, but never reached moderate or strong levels (≥ 70%);
initially high BP values (≥ 80%) changed little with
increased pseudo-replicate search effort.
Strong conflict among genes is a second possible explanation for low BP values at deeper levels, but in our data set,
the rare instances of such conflict are restricted to withinfamily relationships (see Additional file 3). Support might
have been higher had our ML analysis modeled synonymous and non-synonymous character sets separately, but
the near-identical topologies produced by our unpartitioned ML and partitioned Bayesian analyses for all nucleotides suggests that the effect would not be dramatic. The
most plausible explanation for low support is that the
branches along the "backbone" are very short, as evidenced in the phylogram of Fig. 3, in contrast to the very
long branches subtending some superfamilies (e.g., Tortricoidea, Lasiocampoidea, Hesperioidea) and/or subgroups therein. Short internodes along the "backbone",
which may reflect rapid radiation, suggest that very large
amounts of sequence, as well as more accurate modeling
of character change, will be needed to firmly resolve these
nodes.
In contrast to low support under ML, posterior probabilities along the "backbone" in the Bayesian analyses were
very high, mostly 1.0. The sole purpose of our Bayesian
analysis was to examine the effect of partitioned analysis
on tree topology. The interpretation of the associated posterior probabilities is problematic, due to their oftenreported tendency toward "overcredibility" (e.g.
[41,57,58]). Lewis et al. [59] attribute "overcredibility" to
the failure of the tree-proposal step in current Bayesian
phylogenetic algorithms to allow the possibility of polytomies. In the absence of true signal, this restriction can artificially confer very high posterior probabilities on
arbitrary resolutions. This explanation seems quite consistent with our findings.
Differing properties among character sets and their
implications
Several potential benefits motivate our focus on separating and independently analyzing sites undergoing synonymous versus non-synonymous change, as exemplified by
our distinction between the character sets "noLRall2 +
nt2" and "LRall2 + nt3". These categories can be defined
in all protein-coding sequences, and the substitutions
they undergo are known to follow markedly different
rules. To some extent, then, they provide independent
lines of phylogenetic evidence, thereby boosting our confidence in groupings that they separately recover. Separate
analysis also allows us to discover the evolutionary properties peculiar to each, and to account for these when considering the two character sets together. Thus, it is
reassuring that although there are numerous differences

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/280

in detail involving nodes with little support, particularly
at deeper levels, trees based on noLR + nt2, nt12 and
nt123, which though not fully independent span a gradient from entirely non-synonymous to predominantly synonymous evolution, are quite similar overall. They are
generally concordant for nodes with modest to strong BP
support. Even moderately strong conflict - reciprocal BP ≥
70% support for incompatible groupings - is essentially
absent.
Analysis of nt3 alone, however, complicates the picture.
Despite contributing about 90% of the total evolutionary
change for nt123, nt3 by itself provides relatively weak
resolution, and fails to recover many well-established
nodes. Yet when added to nt1 + 2, it can often greatly
increase support for those nodes (e.g. Geometridae,
Pyraloidea, Yponomeutidae), particularly at shallower
levels, providing dramatic examples of "hidden support"
[60]. On the other hand, adding nt3 sometimes markedly
decreases support for deeper nodes, e.g. Gelechioidea,
"core" Zygaenoidea, Yponomeutoidea + Gracillarioidea.
Nt3 seems to contain a complex mixture of true phylogenetic signal and conflicting signal from non-phylogenetic
sources. The latter undoubtedly stems in part from nonhomogeneity of base composition. It appears that for
shallower divergences the non-phylogenetic signal in nt3
is relatively easily overcome by the addition of non-synonymous signal. For deeper divergences, in contrast, it
appears that either true phylogenetic signal at nt3 is weakened by saturation, or non-phylogenetic signal becomes
relatively stronger, or both, leading typically to less resolving power. And yet, nt3 does carry some true signal for
deeper divergences, possibly because it undergoes at least
some non-synonymous change. For example, it is probably not coincidence that only with nt3 included do we
completely recover, albeit with weak support, both Zygaenoidea and Sesioidea + Cossoidea + Zygaenoidea. Our
analyses of nt3 alone provide one of the first examples of
an influence of compositional heterogeneity on estimated
phylogeny at relatively low taxonomic levels; previous
demonstrations have mostly involved much deeper divergences (but see Gruber et al. [61]). One might take comfort in the disappearance of the obvious effects of
composition on topology when nt3 is combined with
other character sets. Compositional heterogeneity
remains a likely contributor, however, to the instability
and lower support that inclusion of nt3 brings to some
deeper-level groupings. The problem cannot be easily dismissed.
Given that different character sets can differentially support, and/or obscure, each individual node, treating all
character sets as belonging to a single population of characters (as in our nt123 ML analysis) is clearly not the most
effective way of extracting phylogenetic information from
the data set. Ideally, one would analyze all character sets
Page 15 of 21

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:280

simultaneously, using a model that fully accounted for the
differences in evolutionary behavior among them. The
widely-available methods for partitioned analyses, however, do not yet include correction for heterogeneity of
nucleotide composition, a key point of difference between
mainly synonymous and mainly non-synonymous character sets. In the review below, we therefore adopt an
interim strategy for assessing progress on ditrysian phylogeny: a group is considered to be supported by the data
set as a whole to the degree that it is (a) strongly supported
by one or more character sets, and (b) at most weakly contradicted by others. At present, no single analysis can tell
the whole story.
Current understanding of ditrysian phylogeny
In this section we ask, how much progress did this exploratory study yield toward a robust phylogeny estimate for
Ditrysia, and toward testing the working hypotheses compiled by Kristensen [5]?

The near-total lack of strong support for nodes subtending
multiple superfamilies, with especially low bootstraps
along the "backbone", is sobering. We expected more
from 6.7 kb of sequence data chosen specifically for their
suitability for addressing this problem. It appears that
robust node-by-node resolution of among-superfamily
ditrysian relationships will require several to many times
as much sequence as analyzed here, in addition to
expanded taxon sampling, particularly among the nonobtectomeran lineages. Fortunately, two independent
efforts to provide such additional data are underway (see
http://www.Leptree.net).
Low bootstraps for deep nodes notwithstanding, however, our current data do provide important first steps
toward resolving ditrysian phylogeny. How can this be?
Conventional bootstrap values can greatly underestimate
the amount of structure present in a large, noisy data set,
because they take into account only nodes that agree completely between pseudo-replicate trees, ignoring partial
agreement on those groupings [62]. Thus, given the taxon
sample size, we think that the approximate overall concordance of our trees with the "backbone" hypothesis in
Fig. 2A is unlikely to be accidental, despite the lack of
bootstrap support. Our results provide some of the first
quantitative phylogenetic evidence for broad subdivisions
of Ditrysia resembling those of Minet [6], albeit with
important differences. The clearest point of correspondence is that all analyses apart from nt3 yield a clade consisting of most Macrolepidoptera plus one or more nonmacrolepidopteran Obtectomera, and excluding all nonobtectomerans.
This mostly macrolepidopteran clade, however, also harbors one of the strongest departures from the working
hypothesis. The Pyraloidea, traditionally considered non-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/280

macrolepidopterans, invariably group with the "core"
Macrolepidoptera identified here (which exclude butterflies), while the butterflies sensu Scoble, always traditionally considered macrolepidopterans, never do so. Despite
weak support for individual nodes, the Approximately
Unbiased test [45] provides statistical evidence against
monophyly of the Macrolepidoptera as previously
defined (Fig. 2A), significantly rejecting it for nt12 (P =
0.02) although not for the other character sets. Minet's [6]
exclusion of Pyraloidea from Macrolepidoptera was based
on their supposed lack of his synapomorphy 17, a feature
of the base of the forewing. Recent unpublished observations by one of us (MAS), however, strongly suggest that
this feature is in fact characteristic of pyraloids. The distribution of this trait deserves further study in other superfamilies as well.
The existence of a clade comprising "core Macrolepidoptera" plus Pyraloidea, which we predict that future work
will confirm, is likely to prompt re-examination of
hypotheses about the evolution of the thoracic or abdominal ultrasound-detecting "ears" that characterize the
superfamilies Noctuoidea, Geometroidea, Drepanoidea
and Pyraloidea. These together contain over 90% of species in the putative clade. The "ear" found in each superfamily shows a unique location and anatomy, and has
been thought to represent an independent origin. Our
result prompts contemplation, at least, of the possibility
of fewer origins, conceivably even a single origin in the
common ancestor of the proposed clade (though there is
disagreement among the authors of this work regarding
the plausibility of this hypothesis). This alternative
hypothesis would require only a few independent losses
of the "ear," in the ancestors of Bombycoidea + Lasiocampidae, Cimeliidae (= Axiidae), and Sematuridae + Epicopeiidae. The observation [9] that the anatomy of the "ear"
and/or the location of its opening can vary between sister
families (Pyralidae versus Crambidae) or between sexes
within the same family (Uraniidae) suggests that transformation among widely differing types of "ear" is at least
plausible.
The unexpected position of the butterflies is also reflected
in the strongest result from our tests for non-monophyly,
namely the decisive rejection (P < 0.005, all character sets)
of the proposed clade aligning butterflies and allies with
Geometroidea, Drepanoidea, Cimelioidea (= Axioidea)
and Calliduloidea [6]. In our trees, no two of these taxa
consistently group with or even near each other. It seems
safe to abandon this conjecture. An alternative hypothesis
about phylogeny of the major macrolepidopteran groups,
grouping Geometroidea with Noctuoidea and these
together with Bombycoidea + Lasiocampoidea, is worthy
of contemplation because it is supported, albeit weakly, in
all our analyses. In contrast, placement of the several
small, morphologically isolated and highly divergent

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:280

macrolepidopteran superfamilies may be very difficult.
The problem is illustrated by the unstable position of
Mimallonidae and our inability to significantly reject their
alliance with Bombycoidea and Lasiocampoidea, despite
their failure to ever group near these superfamilies.
Within several large superfamilies of the "core Macrolepidoptera + Pyraloidea" clade, our results provide some of
the first strong tests of hypothesized relationships (Figs. 2,
3). In Geometroidea, our findings corroborate, albeit with
weak support, the grouping of Sematuridae, which lack
abdominal tympanal organs, with Uraniidae and
Geometridae, which possess them. A novel result is that
all data sets place Epicopeiidae, included in Drepanoidea
by the working hypothesis, either next to or within
Geometroidea. The strongest signal comes from nt123,
which resolves Epicopeiidae as sister group to Sematuridae (BP = 67%), with which they share the lack of tympanal organs. Within Geometridae, one of the largest
families of Lepidoptera, we sampled all subfamilies, finding moderate to very strong support for nearly all relationships among these (Fig. 3), and strong agreement with
groupings seen in other recent molecular studies of this
family [21,63].
In Noctuoidea, our findings very strongly (BP = 94-100%)
corroborate previous morphological and/or molecular
evidence for monophyly of: (a) the quadrifid forewing
clade of families; (b) within this, the clade of "trifine"
hindwing subfamilies; and (c) a clade comprising most
quadrifine hindwing Noctuidae plus Arctiidae and
Lymantriidae, excluding Nolidae (the "LAQ" clade of
Mitchell et al. [53]), contra recent morphology-based
hypotheses [64]. The recently erected family Micronoctuidae [64] also appears to fall in the "LAQ" clade. The most
surprising result is the failure of Doa (Doidae) to group
with the remaining Noctuoidea, despite its possession of
the very distinctive morphological synapomorphies of the
superfamily, including a metathoracic tympanal organ
and two MD setae on larval T3 [65]. No position for Doa
is strongly supported, however, and noctuoid monophyly
is not significantly rejected by the Approximately Unbiased test. Thus, it remains possible that Doa will group
with other noctuoids upon further gene and taxon sampling. The postulated sister group relationship between
Doidae and Notodontidae [65], on the other hand, now
seems very unlikely, given the strong support (BP = 83%,
nt123) for a clade comprising all sampled Noctuoidea
except Doa.
Pyraloidea are recovered by all data sets (except nt3),
albeit with low support (BP = 65%, nt123). Though our
sampling of subfamilies is incomplete, the five genes
appear to offer strong resolution of relationships within
this superfamily, including very strong bootstrap support

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/280

(BP ≥ 99%) for monophyly of both Pyralidae and Crambidae as sampled. Divergences among all exemplars of
Pyralidae, representing all five subfamilies, were strongly
resolved (BP 80-100%). Relationships among subfamilies
nearly match a previous morphology-based tree [66],
requiring only a trade in position of the subfamilies Pyralinae and Phycitinae. In Crambidae, relationships of the
five (of 14) subfamilies sampled were also strongly
resolved, corresponding well to the morphological
hypothesis of Yoshiyasu [67], less well to that of Solis and
Maes [16].
In contrast to their success in the foregoing clades, our
data do not strongly resolve relationships of the butterflies sensu Scoble [51]. The three superfamilies do form a
clade, but only in analyses excluding nt3, and neither the
monophyly of Papilionoidea, nor any of the accepted
relationships among the families thereof except the basal
position of Papilionidae, is supported by any analysis. On
the other hand, the Approximately Unbiased test (Table
1) does not reject monophyly for Papilionoidea (P >
0.38), and bootstrap supports are mostly low for groupings contradicting expectation, the highest being 68% for
the unexpected pairings of Hedylidae with Hesperiidae
and Pieridae with Nymphalidae. Thus, apart from qualitatively corroborating Scoble's grouping of Macrosoma
(Hedylidae) with butterflies rather than Geometridae, we
are unable to strongly confirm or refute any previous
hypothesis about butterfly relationships. Our results raise
the possibility, however, that butterfly relationships will
undergo significant revision as more data accumulate.
Evidence both for and against predicted relationships is
less strong in the lower ditrysian lineages than in Obtectomera, which were much more extensively sampled.
Nonetheless, some tentative conclusions emerge. Two
non-apoditrysian lineages are always nested well inside
the Apoditrysia as currently defined, the monophyly of
which is consequently never supported. The pairing of
Yponomeutoidea and Gracillarioidea, a novel grouping
so far as we are aware, is the most strongly supported
among-superfamily relationship in our study (BP = 79%,
nt12).
Within the lower Apoditrysia ("A-O" in Fig. 3), one of the
few previous postulates of among-superfamily relationships [6] groups Zygaenoidea with Sesioidea + Cossoidea.
Agreement between our analyses and previous hypotheses
is ambiguous throughout this putative clade, suggesting
signal too weak to be decisive. The proposed groupings
are only sometimes monophyletic, and yet never strongly
contradicted. The trio of superfamilies is fully recovered
by nt123 (Fig. 2B), albeit with very weak support, and is
at least somewhat coherent in the other analyses. In the
nt12 tree (Fig. 2E), for example, it is basal and para-

Page 17 of 21
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:280

phyletic with respect to all other taxa except Tineidae.
Thus, the proposed grouping Sesioidea + Cossoidea is
never monophyletic, but in nt123 it is at least paraphyletic, comprising the two lineages most closely related
to Zygaenoidea. Within this assemblage, however, neither
Sesioidea (Sesiidae + Castniidae) nor Cossidae are monophyletic in any analysis.
Our data provide similarly qualified support for Zygaenoidea, the monophyly of which is uncertainly established by morphology [68]. The eight families sampled
(of 12) were grouped together by one data set, nt123, but
with weak support. We did however find a consistently
monophyletic core group of six zygaenoid families, with
bootstrap support as high as 82% (nt12, Fig. 2E).
Excluded from the "core Zygaenoidea" were the parasitic
families Epipyropidae and Cyclotornidae. The weaklysupported sister group relationship between these families seen in nt123 (Fig. 2B) seems credible, despite the
exceptionally long branches subtending both, because of
their bizarre shared larval habit of ectoparasitism on
Auchenorrhyncha. Within the "core Zygaenoidea" we find
qualified support for the morphologically-defined "limacodid group" of families [68], here represented by Limacodidae, Dalceridae, Megalopygidae and Aididae. These
form a clade, weakly supported, in the noLRall2 + nt2 tree,
and a paraphyletic group in other analyses. Relationships
within the "limacodid group" agree partially with the
morphological cladogram of Epstein [69], in that Dalceridae are most often grouped with Limacodidae (nt123,
noLRall2 + nt2), albeit with weak support. The only
strongly supported node, however, unites Aididae with
Megalopygidae (BP ≥ 99%), in which they were formerly
included, contra Epstein's hypothesis grouping them with
Dalceridae + Limacodidae. Within Zygaenidae our data
moderately to strongly support the relationships reported
by Niehuis et al. [70] for the three subfamilies sampled.
In Tortricoidea, finally, though our sampling is limited to
two of three subfamilies and six of 21 tribes, the five genes
appear able to offer decisive resolution, as all nodes are
strongly supported. Support is 99-100% for monophyly
of the two subfamilies as thus far sampled. The representative of Cochylini, in the past treated as a separate family
[71,72], was strongly placed as sister group to the two
other sampled tribes of Tortricinae, consistent with the
proposal of Kuznetsov and Stekolnikov [73,74].

Conclusion
The five genes/6.7 kb and 123 species analyzed here provide sufficient information to: (a) corroborate the broad
outlines of the current working phylogenetic hypothesis
for Ditrysia; (b) conclusively demonstrate that several
prominent features of that hypothesis, including the position of the butterflies, need revision; and, (c) strongly
resolve the majority of family and subfamily relationships

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/280

within superfamilies as thus far sampled. However, these
data alone cannot strongly resolve node-by-node relationships among superfamilies of Ditrysia. Such resolution
will clearly require a substantial increase in both sequence
and taxon sampling. Moreover, given the complexity of
character variation at deeper levels of divergence, especially the saturation and strong compositional heterogeneity characterizing nt3, full resolution of ditrysian
relationships will require careful dissection of true from
misleading phylogenetic signal.

Specimen information and Genbank numbers. For each specimen
sequenced we list superfamily, family, genus and species name, code
name, collection locality, GenBank accession numbers for all sequences,
and missing and partial sequences. Numbers after the superfamily name
indicate number of families sampled/number of families total. An L in
parentheses after the species name means the specimen sequenced was a
larva; a P in parentheses means it was a pupa. All other specimens were
adults. An 'X' in the Genbank number table means that no sequence was
obtained for that gene in that taxon.

Single-gene bootstrap analyses. We present a table of bootstrap values
obtained from a separate analysis of all nucleotides for each gene, for all
nodes on the all-nt ML tree plus all other nodes supported by BP of 50%
or greater by any gene. We summarize the evidence on bootstrap-supported groupings that conflict with those found for other individual genes,
with the all-gene result, and with conventional understanding of relationships, and examine the two instances of strong conflict.
