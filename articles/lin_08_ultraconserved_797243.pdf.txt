Abstract
Background: All bilaterian animals share a general genetic framework that controls the formation
of their body structures, although their forms are highly diversified. The Hox genes that encode
transcription factors play a central role in this framework. All Hox proteins contain a highly
conserved homeodomain encoded by the homeobox motif, but the other regions are generally
assumed to be less conserved. In this study, we used comparative genomic methods to infer
possible functional elements in the coding regions of mammalian Hox genes.
Results: We identified a set of ultraconserved coding regions (UCRs) outside the homeobox of
mammalian Hox genes. Here a UCR is defined as a region of at least 120 nucleotides without
synonymous and nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions among different orders of mammals.
Further analysis has indicated that these UCRs occur only in placental mammals and they evolved
apparently after the split of placental mammals from marsupials. Analysis of human SNP data
suggests that these UCRs are maintained by strong purifying selection.
Conclusion: Although mammalian genomes are known to contain ultraconserved non-coding
elements (UNEs), this paper seems to be the first to report the UCRs in protein coding genes. The
extremely high degree of sequence conservation in non-homeobox regions suggests that they
might have important roles for the functions of Hox genes. We speculate that UCRs have some
gene regulatory functions possibly in relation to the development of the intra-uterus child-bearing
system.

Background
An unexpected feature of mammalian genomes is that
they contain a large number of ultraconserved DNA elements [1]. These elements have been shown to be under
strong purifying selection, and therefore they are believed
to have some important biological functions [2]. The specific functions of these elements and the mechanism that
led to formation of these regions remain unclear. Some
studies have suggested that these regions may play a role

in the regulation of their neighboring developmental
genes [3,4]. These ultraconserved elements have been
identified almost exclusively from noncoding regions of
the genome.
During the course of studying DNA sequence divergence
of Hox genes among different mammalian orders, we
noticed that many ultraconserved regions exist in the protein coding regions outside the homeobox. Hox genes

encode a group of transcription factors that control the
segmentation identities of developing animal embryos
along the head-to-tail axis. These proteins contain a
domain called the homeodomain encoded by the homeobox motif. The amino acid sequences of the homeodomain have been conserved even between mammals and
insects [5]. At the nucleotide level, however, synonymous
nucleotide substitutions occur with reasonably high frequencies [6]. Therefore, the homeobox motifs are not
ultraconserved regions.
Hox genes tend to be organized into gene clusters, and
there is a striking correlation between the order of Hox
genes in the cluster and the spatial patterns of their expression in the developing embryo. The Hox genes at the 3'
end of the cluster are expressed in the anterior regions of
the embryo and those genes at the 5'end are expressed in
the posterior regions. This cluster organization and the
expression pattern of Hox genes are highly conserved
from arthropods to mammals [7]. Multiple duplication
events of these gene clusters have led to a significant
expansion of the Hox gene family in vertebrates. As a
result, four Hox clusters (denoted as HoxA, HoxB, HoxC
and HoxD) are present on separate chromosomes in
mammalian species. According to the position in the clusters, the Hox genes in the four clusters can be classified
into thirteen cognate (orthologous gene) groups. However, some members of these cognate groups have been
lost, and only 39 Hox genes are currently present in the
human and other mammalian genomes (Fig. 1A).
Although the homeodomain is highly conserved, the
sequences outside the homeodomain in Hox proteins are
generally quite divergent and do not contain conserved
domains except some small motifs such as the MXSXFE
motif at the N-terminus and the YPWM motif near the
homeodomain. Some studies have been conducted on
these non-homeodomain regions of Drosophila Hox
genes. For example, the C-terminal region of the Drosophila Ubx protein was shown to serve as a repressor
domain, and sequence changes in this region are correlated with limb pattern differences between insects and
crustaceans [8,9]. Another study on the Drosophila Abd-B
gene indicates that protein domains outside the homeodomain influence the activation or repression of target
gene expression [10]. These studies suggest that protein
regions outside the homeodomain of other Hox proteins
might also have some effects on embryonic development
and morphological evolution. In this study, we examined
the rates of nucleotide substitutions in different coding
regions of Hox genes to identify potentially important
functional elements. Interestingly, we found that many
ultraconserved regions are present between orthologous
mammalian Hox genes, and most of them are located out-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/260

side the homeobox motif, indicating that they are probably important for the functions of Hox genes.

Results and discussion
Ultraconserved Coding Regions (UCRs) present in many
mammalian Hox genes
A preliminary sliding window analysis was performed to
study the synonymous and nonsynonymous nucleotide
substitutions between orthologous Hox genes from
human, dog and mouse to identify conserved coding
regions. We then found that some coding regions are
ultraconserved between different species. Neither nonsynonymous nor synonymous substitutions were observed in
these regions, which may include as many as hundreds of
nucleotide sites (Fig. 2 and 3). Because these species have
diverged over 90 million years ago [11,12], it is unlikely
to observe these conserved regions if the synonymous
substitutions are free from natural selection [13]. Considering that the nucleotide identity between the human and
mouse genomes is about 40% [14], the probability of
observing two identical sequences with more than 100
consecutive nucleotide sites by chance will be = (0.4)-100.
Therefore, it appears that the synonymous sites as well as
the nonsynonymous sites in these regions have been
highly conserved.

In the present study, we defined an Ultraconserved Coding Region (UCR) as a region with at least 120 nucleotides
(40 codons) that do not contain any synonymous substitutions between two distantly related species (divergence
time ~90 million years or more). Using 120 nucleotides as
the threshold is not based on considerations of biological
functions but merely statistical convenience. It can be
shown that the probability of occurrence of a UCR by
chance is extremely small if this criterion is applied.
To detect the UCRs in the mammalian lineages, we performed a sliding window analysis of synonymous and
nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions for each pair of
Hox orthologous genes from six species (human, dog,
cow, mouse, opossum and platypus) representing six different mammalian orders (Fig 1B). We found that the
UCRs in Hox genes are frequently detected in placental
mammals (Table. 1 and Additional file 1). For example,
33 UCRs were detected in 21 Hox genes in the dog/cow
comparison (Table 1). We also found 26 UCRs in 19 Hox
orthologous genes between human and dog, 23 UCRs in
19 Hox genes in the human/cow comparison, and 14
UCRs in 13 Hox genes in the human/mouse comparison.
In summary, at least 12 UCRs were found in the Hox
genes in each pairwise comparison of placental mammals.
Furthermore, many of these UCRs were found repeatedly
in different pairwise comparisons (see Additional file 1),
indicating that these regions have been conserved
throughout the evolution of placental mammals. Consid-

ering that the divergence time between dog and cow is less
than 90 million years and their Hox sequences are highly
similar, we decided not to include the UCRs that are only
found in the two species for further analysis.

In contrast, the number of UCRs is significantly reduced
in the comparison between a placental mammal and the
marsupial opossum (Monodelphis domestica) or duckbilled platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus). This paucity of

Nucleotide sequences of orthologous HoxC6 genes from six mammalian species
Nucleotide sequences of orthologous HoxC6 genes from six mammalian species. The ultraconserved coding
regions (UCRs) are shaded by blue and the homeobox motif is underlined in red.

UCRs could possibly be due to longer divergence times
between these species, and therefore more synonymous
substitutions have accumulated. Although another possible reason is that the coverage of genomic sequences of
opossum and platypus are incomplete and several Hox
genes were not retrieved, this is unlikely to affect our
results because we did uncover most of the Hox genes
from these species and only about half of the missing ones
have UCRs in comparison of genes from placental mammals. Similarly, UCRs were not detected in Hox orthologs
between two closely related puffer fishes, Takifugu rubripes
and Tetraodon nigroviridis, even though the time of divergence between these two species has been estimated to be

only 18â30 million years [15]. Furthermore, we did not
identify any UCR for 8 Hox gene pairs between two Drosophila species, D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura,
whose divergence time is less than 30 million years [16].
Therefore, the presence of UCRs in the Hox genes is likely
to be unique to placental mammals.
Although we used a threshold of 120 nucleotides, the
length of a UCR was often much longer than this. For
example, a UCR of 348 nucleotides is present in HoxC6
genes between the human and dog, and this region is also
highly conserved in all other placental mammals (Fig. 2).
Note that this region is located outside the highly con-

served homeobox motif. In the homeobox motif, a
number of synonymous substitutions were observed
although the nonsynonymous sites are identical (Fig. 3).
The difference of the conservation level of synonymous
sites between the homeobox and UCR regions indicates
that the occurrence of UCRs is more likely to be due to
purifying selection at both synonymous and nonsynonymous sites. It also indicates that the appearance of UCRs
is unlikely to be due to conservation of protein sequence,
although it was previously found that highly conserved
nonsynonymous sites are usually associated with conserved synonymous sites [17]. The mammalian Hox genes
usually contain two exons and one intron. The homeobox
motif is located in the second exon in all mammalian Hox
genes. However, most UCRs are found in the first exon,
and many of them appear at the 5'end of the coding
sequences (CDS) (see Additional file 1), indicating that
they are located in non-homeobox regions.
Although a long UCR is present in HoxC6 gene, the other
Hox6 group genes do not contain such a long UCR. For
example, many synonymous substitutions are detected in
the corresponding region of HoxB6 (Fig. 3). Such differences were also observed between members of other cognate groups (see Additional file 1). In addition, even if
UCRs are present in all genes of a cognate group (e.g.,
group 5 and 8), UCRs are observed at somewhat different
locations (see Additional file 1).
Comparison of the frequency of UCRs among different
gene clusters and different regions of clusters showed that
the frequency varies significantly with gene pair. First,
UCRs are more frequent in the HoxC cluster than in any
other clusters. Ten UCRs are detected for 8 out of 9 HoxC
cluster genes, and HoxC genes usually contain long UCRs.
In contrast, only 20 UCRs are found in the other three
gene clusters (30 genes). Second, more UCRs are present
in the central cognate groups (Hox4-8) than those genes
of anterior (Hox1-3) and posterior groups (Hox9-13). For
example, 11 out of 15 central Hox genes contain at least
one UCR (total = 15), while only 11 UCRs were detected
among 24 Hox genes of the other two groups. Further-

more, there is a significant difference in the fraction of
DNA sequence involved in UCRs between central and
non-central Hox genes. The UCRs in the central group of
genes contain 3684 nucleotides, accounting for 32% of
coding sequences, whereas only 10% of nucleotides are
involved in UCR sequences in the other groups of Hox
genes.
Origin and evolution of UCRs
To study the origin and evolution of the UCRs, we concatenated the nucleotide sequences of 32 UCRs which
were shared by 22 mammalian Hox sequences (see Additional file 2) for the seven eutherian species. We also concatenated the corresponding UCR region of the Hox genes
from opossum, platypus and chicken, and these
sequences were aligned with the eutherian sequences (The
multiple sequence alignments are available in Additional
file 3). We then computed the numbers of synonymous
(dS) and nonsynonymous (dN) substitutions for all pairs
of ten species. We then related the dS and dN values for a
pair species to their divergence time. The results of the
study are presented in Fig. 4A. This figure shows that both
dS and dN do not increase appreciably for the first 100 million years during which placental mammals (or eutherians) evolved. As the divergence time increased beyond
100 million years, however, dS rapidly increased up to 340
million years ago (MYA) when eutherians and chicken
diverged. The rate of increase of dN was slow beyond the
first 100 million years but steadily increased up to 340
MYA. These results clearly showed that the eutherian
UCRs evolved around the time of origin of placental
mammals. This conclusion is consistent with previous
observation that UCRs exist primarily between eutherian
genomes.

To clarify this situation graphically, we constructed the
Neighbor-Joining tree of the species involved using the dS
and dN values with the chicken sequence as the outgroup
(Fig. 4B, C). Fig. 4B shows that in the eutherian lineage dS
increased relatively rapidly before the eutherian radiation
but virtually stopped increasing thereafter. This again supports the evolution of UCRs in the early stage of eutherian
evolution. A similar result was observed by dN, though the
reliability of estimates of branch lengths is low in this case
because of the small dN values.
Why did UCRs evolved in placental mammals and how
are they conserved in the genome? It is very difficult to
answer these questions at the present. However, we
noticed that the origin of placental mammals depended
on the evolution of placenta, which grows inside the
mother's uterus and functions as a way to exchange gas
and nutrients between the mother and fetus during gestation [18]. It has been suggested that the placenta of eutherian mammals evolved from a much simpler tissue

Non-linear accumulation of synonymous substitutions in the Hox UCRs. A. The numbers of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions between two species are plotted against their divergence times, which were obtained from the
TimeTree database[50]. B. Neighbor-Joining trees based on synonymous substitutions (dS) which were computed by the pairwise deletion option (Nei and Kumar 2000). The chicken sequence was used as the outgroup. This tree shows short branches
for placental mammals which diverged during the last 100 million years. Opossum and placental mammals have diverged about
145 MYA, but the branch length for opossum is shorter than that for placental mammals. This result indicates that the dS for
placental mammals increased rather rapidly until their emergence. C. Neighbor-Joining tree for dN. The evolutionary pattern of

Mutation rate and the maintenance of UCRs
One of the possible explanations of the maintenance of
UCRs for a long evolutionary time in the eutherian
genome could be a low mutation rate that might be
observed in this specific genomic region. If this hypothesis
is correct, one would expect that the rate of nucleotide
substitution is lower in the intronic and intergenic regions
as well as in the UCRs in these Hox gene regions than in
other regions. Actually, there is some evidence that the
mutation rate is not constant throughout the genome but
varies with genomic region in mammals [14,22]. We
therefore tested this hypothesis by computing the rate of
nucleotide substitution in the intronic and intergenic
regions of the Hox gene complex as well as the rate of synonymous substitution. We studied this problem in relation to the locations of Hox genes because the genes
located in the central region of the Hox gene complex contain UCRs more often than the genes in the noncentral
regions.

The rate of nucleotide substitution between a pair of species was measured by the number of nucleotide substitution (d) between them by using the Jukes-Cantor
formation [23]. Similarly, the rate of synonymous substitution was measured by the number of synonymous
nucleotide substitutions (dS) using the modified Nei and
Gojobori method [23]. The values were computed for all
pairs of human, dog, and mouse and opossum. The
results obtained are presented in Fig 5. Fig. 5A shows that
the dS values are significantly correlated with the positions
of the genes in the Hox gene cluster. The relationship is
more or less U-shaped, and the Hox genes at both ends of

attached to the eggshell of birds and reptiles [18]. Many
Hox genes, including HoxA4, HoxA7, HoxA11, HoxC4,
HoxC5, HoxC6, and HoxC8, have been shown to be
expressed during placental development [19-21]. It is
interesting to note that most of these Hox genes are
located in the central regions of Hox gene clusters and
contain at least one UCR in the coding regions. Although
the specific functions of these Hox genes in placental
development are still unclear, these observations suggest
that they are involved in the growth and differentiation of
trophoblasts. Considering that the Hox genes play important roles in the development of animal embryo development, we can postulate that the eutherian UCRs might
have developed in association with the evolution of placentae. According to this hypothesis, we could further
speculate that new mutations in the UCRs could have
been deleterious after the formation of placentae and
these mutations have been eliminated by purifying selection. In summary, the UCR sequence might be important
for the function of Hox genes in formation of the placenta
and have contributed to the evolution of placental mammals.

the cluster (e.g., cognate groups 1 and 13) have higher dS
than the genes in the central region (cognate groups 4â8).
The dS values of central cognate genes are significantly
lower than those of other Hox genes (P < 3.47 Ã 10-7). This
pattern of dS values was not observed in the comparison of
Hox genes between the two closely related puffer fishes
and between D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura. There-

fore, it is likely that only mammalian Hox gene clusters
show such a position effect, which is consistent with the
occurrence of UCRs only in eutherians.
In addition, the numbers of nucleotide substitutions (d)
of intronic sequences in Hox genes shows a similar Ushaped curve (Fig. 5B), and these values showed a significant correlation with the dS values (R = 0.6465, P < 1.488
Ã 10-5). Similarly, the d values for the intergenic sequences
also showed a U-shape pattern (Fig. 5C). Therefore, all
sites in the central regions of Hox gene clusters (including
coding, intronic and intergenic regions) are more conserved than those of the anterior or posterior genes. This
suggests that low mutation rate in the central region of the
Hox gene cluster is one factor for generating the higher frequency of UCRs in this region. However, the dS values in
the central region of Hox gene complex was significantly
lower than the d values for the intronic and intergenic
region (P < 1.29 Ã 10-4). This higher degree of conservation of the synonymous sites suggests that purifying selection is a more important factor for generating UCRs than
the lower mutation rate.
UCRs have reduced density of synonymous SNPs and
nucleotide diversity
The highly conserved synonymous sites of the UCRs indicate that most mutations at these sites should have some
deleterious effects and purifying selection eliminate the
mutations. Therefore, if the conservation of UCRs is due
to purifying selection, we would expect a decreased frequency of synonymous Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms
(SNPs)
and
reduced
gene
diversity
(heterozygosity) in the UCRs in the human population.
To test this hypothesis, we used human SNP data to estimate the frequency of SNPs inside and outside the UCRs.
As expected, the frequency of synonymous SNPs in UCRs
(2.88/kb) was significantly lower than that in the nonUCRs regions (9.04) of human Hox genes (P < 0.01). The
frequency of nonsynonymous SNPs within UCRs was
1.44/kb, which is also lower than that of non-UCRs (2.73/
kb), although the difference was not significant (P = 0.34).
The significantly reduced frequency of synonymous SNPs
in the UCRs further supports the hypothesis that the synonymous sites in the UCR regions have been constrained
by purifying selection.

We also compared the nucleotide diversity (Ï) between
UCR and non-UCR regions based on SNP data and
observed a significant difference between them. For the
synonymous sites, Ï = 6.01 Ã 10-4 in the UCR regions,
compared to Ï = 0.017 in the non-UCR regions. The Ï =
1.9 Ã 10-4 for nonsynonymous sites in the UCRs, but 4.17
Ã 10-4 in the non-UCR sequences. Therefore, the UCR
regions have much lower nucleotide diversity at both synonymous and nonsynonymous sites than those of non-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/260

UCRs. The reduction of nucleotide diversity in the UCRs
further supports the idea that population frequencies of
deleterious SNP alleles has been reduced by purifying
selection. The evolutionary conservation of UCRs, in turn,
suggests that the UCR sequences may be important for the
proper function of Hox genes.
UCRs might overlap with novel transcripts or function as
regulatory elements
Recent studies have shown that synonymous sites could
be affected by natural selection [24-28]. For example, the
synonymous codons of many highly expressed genes are
not randomly used in many organisms such as bacteria,
plants, fungi and invertebrates [29-31]. Moreover, the
synonymous sites in the Exonic Splicing Enhancers
(ESEs), which affect splicing of pre-mRNA, are also under
purifying selection [27,32-34]. However, we did not
detect a significant correlation between codon usage and
occurrence of UCRs, and there is no statistically significant
difference in the density of ESEs between UCRs and other
regions (data not shown).

In this study, we found that many UCRs are located either
at the 5'end or 3'end of coding regions of genes and their
flanking noncoding regions are also highly conserved in
some cases. As a consequence, large conserved blocks covering both coding and noncoding regions are present in
some Hox genes. For example, the noncoding sequences
are highly conserved near the UCRs in HoxC4, HoxC5 and
HoxC6 (Additional file 4A), forming long conserved
blocks (over 500 nucleotides). Further analysis indicated
that these regions are only conserved in placental mammals, similar to the UCRs (Additional file 4B). Currently,
information about the functions and evolutionary origins
of these conserved blocks is not available. At present time,
we can not exclude the possibility that these blocks might
be the overlapping regions of Hox genes and other
unknown RNA transcript genes.
Such potential overlapping genes can be transcribed in the
same or reverse direction to the Hox genes. Antisense RNA
transcription has been implicated in various forms of gene
regulation, including RNAi-like degradation of corresponding sense RNA transcripts and competition with
sense transcription. For example, a 177-nt antisense RNA
is transcribed from the central coding region of the photosynthesis gene IsiA in cyanobacteria and suppresses the
expression of gene IsiA under some conditions [35]. A
recent study has shown that the HoxA clusters are
enriched in antisense transcripts and many of these transcripts overlap with coding regions [36]. Among them, the
HoxA11 antisense RNA transcript has been well characterized and shown to have a function in regulating the
expression of the HoxA11 gene [37,38]. We noticed that a
HoxA11 antisense transcript overlaps with the coding

(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:260

region of the first HoxA11 exon [37], where a UCR is identified in this study. Although we did not find any information in the literature for other antisense transcripts that
overlap with UCRs studying Hox genes, the possibility of
antisense transcription still remains. A recent detailed
analysis on 1% of the human genome indicates that substantial portions of the unannotated sequences are transcribed and many transcripts overlap one another
extensively [39]. Therefore, we should consider the possibility that the occurrence of UCRs in the mammalian Hox
genes is related to the presence of overlapping RNA transcripts, including antisense RNAs.
Some ultraconserved elements in the noncoding regions
of mammalian genomes have been shown to function as
regulatory elements of neighboring developmental genes
[3,4]. The Hox genes are the master control genes for animal embryonic development and are organized into conserved clusters. There is evidence that this organization is
critical for the control of the proper spatial and temporal
expression of Hox genes [40]. A number of conserved
noncoding sequences of 60 to hundreds of nucleotides
have been identified in the intergenic regions of Hox clusters by comparative genomic studies, and they were considered to be putative regulatory elements of Hox genes
[41]. Although the UCRs are found in the coding regions,
it is possible that these regions contain regulatory elements for their own genes or downstream genes. A similar
scenario has been observed about the expression regulation of Î²-globin gene cluster, which has been the subject
of extensive studies [42]. Different Î²-globin genes are
expressed at various development stages. The elements
close to the globin genes and the arrangement of the
globin genes control their expression switching in different developmental stages[42]. The Hox genes have a similar cluster organization and they are also expressed
differently at various developmental stages. Therefore, the
UCRs might also serve as regulatory elements to control
their neighboring Hox genes. If this is the case, selection
on both regulatory elements and coding sequences in the
same region has led to the formation and/or maintenance
of these UCRs. Because the UCRs are much longer than
usual protein binding motifs, it is possible that multiple
binding motifs are present in a single UCR. The sequence,
number and order of these motifs could be important for
their regulatory functions, and the combination of these
factors might explain the formation of the UCRs [42].
Alternatively, these extraordinarily long UCRs might
interact with RNAs or DNAs in other genomic regions and
such interactions might require more highly conserved
sequences. Therefore, it is reasonable to postulate that
these UCRs are involved in the regulation of expression of
Hox genes.

Conclusion
It appears that ultraconserved elements are frequently
present in the mammalian genomes, especially near or in
regulatory genes [1,28]. The appearance of UCRs in mammalian Hox genes suggests that they might play important
roles during embryo development. Placental mammals
are fundamentally different from other mammals in
regard to the early developmental environment and fetal
nourishment. Previous studies have shown that a number
of Hox genes that contain UCRs are expressed in the placenta, although their functions are still unclear [19-21].
Taking into account the important roles of the Hox genes
in animal embryonic development and morphological
evolution, we cannot ignore the potential connection
between the appearance of UCRs and advent of long gestation periods in placental mammals. Therefore, it would
be particularly important to study the functions of the
UCRs during fetal development. Point mutations at the
synonymous sites in the UCRs could be introduced to test
if these sites are required for the proper function of mammalian Hox genes. The experimental test could also provide further understanding about the functions of
sequences outside the homeobox motif and their roles in
the evolution of placental mammals.

Experimental procedures
Data mining
The protein coding sequences (CDS) and genomic
sequences of Hox genes of human (Homo sapiens), mouse
(Mus musculus), dog (Canis familiaris) and the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster were obtained from the NCBI database. These Hox protein sequences were used as queries to
blast the NCBI nr database for Hox genes from other representative organisms. TBLASTN was performed against
the genomic sequences from NCBI genomic databases to
obtain as many Hox sequences as possible from the following species: chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), rhesus
macaque (Macaca mulatta), cow (Bos Taurus), dog (Canis
familiaris), rat (Rattus norvegicus), gray short-tailed opossum (Monodelphis domestica), duck-billed platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus), chicken (Gallus gallus), zebrafish
(Danio rerio), Japanese pufferfish (Takifugu rubripes), and
green pufferfish (Tetraodon nigroviridis). The putative coding regions and their protein products were predicted
from their genomic sequences based on sequence homology.
Sequence analysis
The protein sequences of each Hox orthologous group
from human, dog, cow, mouse, opossum and platypus
were used to generate a multiple sequence alignment by
using ClustalX 1.83 [43]. Corresponding nucleotide
sequence alignments were then reexamined to improve
the alignments based on these protein sequence alignments to avoid frame-shift errors in GeneDoc [44]. The

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:260

alignments of all available Hox genes (43 pairs) from Japanese pufferfish and green pufferfish were generated separately using the same procedure. Similarly, the
alignments of eight Hox genes from two Drosophila species, D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura, were also produced. In order to detect a coding region without any
synonymous substitution in a region of 120 nucleotides
or longer, a sliding window analysis was performed. The
size of each sliding window was 120 nucleotides (40
codons), and it moved by every single codon. In each window, the proportion of synonymous differences per synonymous site (pS) and proportion of nonsynonymous
differences per nonsynonymous site (pN) were calculated
by using the Nei and Gojobori method to minimize the
estimation error [45,46]. The ultraconserved coding
region (UCR) was detected if pS = 0 and pN = 0 in these
sliding windows. The perl script for sliding window analysis was provided by Masafumi Nozawa (Personal communication). The multiple sequence alignment of each UCR
was then further inspected to detect the presence of insertions and deletions (indels). Only UCRs without any
indel were used in this study.
Multiple nucleotide sequence alignments of the UCRs
were constructed using sequences from human, chimpanzee, macaque, dog, mouse, rat, opossum, platypus and
chicken. A concatenated alignment was generated by joining all the UCRs. The number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (dS) and the number of
nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site
(dN) for each pair of concatenated UCR sequences were
estimated by using the modified Nei-Gojobori method in
MEGA4 [6,45,47]. Neighbor Joining (NJ) trees of the concatenated UCR sequences were reconstructed separately
based on their synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions in MEGA4.
Pairwise dS values of whole coding regions of Hox genes
between human, dog and mouse were calculated by the
modified Nei-Gojobori method in MEGA4. The intron
and intergenic sequences of Hox clusters were retrieved
from human (build 36.2), mouse (Build 37.1) and dog
genomic sequences and aligned by ClustalX. Pairwise
rates of nucleotide substitutions of these intronic and
intergenic sequences were estimated by the same method
between the three species.
SNP, ESE, and Codon usage bias analysis
Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) data for each
human Hox gene were obtained from the NCBI dbSNP
database. The numbers of polymorphic synonymous and
nonsynonymous per site were determined for UCR and
non-UCR regions. The nucleotide diversity (average

where n is the number of DNA sequences examined, and

Exonic Splicing Enhancers (ESEs) in UCRs and non-UCRs
of each human Hox gene were obtained by examining the
human RESCUE-ESE WebServer [48]. The values of Effective Number of Codons of the Hox genes from different
lineages were estimated using the web server of CodonW
[49].
