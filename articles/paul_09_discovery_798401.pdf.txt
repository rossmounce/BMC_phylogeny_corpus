Abstract
Background: Studies have shown that in the genome of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1)
regions responsible for interactions with the host's immune system, namely, cytotoxic Tlymphocyte (CTL) epitopes tend to cluster together in relatively conserved regions. On the other
hand, "epitope-less" regions or regions with relatively low density of epitopes tend to be more
variable. However, very little is known about relationships among epitopes from different genes, in
other words, whether particular epitopes from different genes would occur together in the same
viral genome. To identify CTL epitopes in different genes that co-occur in HIV genomes, association
rule mining was used.
Results: Using a set of 189 best-defined HIV-1 CTL/CD8+ epitopes from 9 different proteincoding genes, as described by Frahm, Linde & Brander (2007), we examined the complete genomic
sequences of 62 reference HIV sequences (including 13 subtypes and sub-subtypes with
approximately 4 representative sequences for each subtype or sub-subtype, and 18 circulating
recombinant forms). The results showed that despite inclusion of recombinant sequences that
would be expected to break-up associations of epitopes in different genes when two different
genomes are recombined, there exist particular combinations of epitopes (epitope associations)
that occur repeatedly across the world-wide population of HIV-1. For example, Pol epitope
LFLDGIDKA is found to be significantly associated with epitopes GHQAAMQML and FLKEKGGL
from Gag and Nef, respectively, and this association rule is observed even among circulating
recombinant forms.
Conclusion: We have identified CTL epitope combinations co-occurring in HIV-1 genomes
including different subtypes and recombinant forms. Such co-occurrence has important
implications for design of complex vaccines (multi-epitope vaccines) and/or drugs that would target
multiple HIV-1 regions at once and, thus, may be expected to overcome challenges associated with
viral escape.

Background
In the course of viral infection, recognition of viral peptides by class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
molecules and subsequent interactions of the peptide/

MCH complex with the cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs, or
CD8+ T cells) plays an important role in the control of the
infection [1,2]. Viral CTL epitopes (which are short viral
peptides recognized by the immune system components,

CTL and MHC class I molecules) are an integral – and critical – part of this recognition process, and amino acid
changes at CTL epitopes have been shown to play a role in
viral "escape" (in other words, evading recognition by the
immune system) in human (HIV) and simian (SIV)
immunodeficiency viruses [3-8]. In particular, in HIV certain CTL epitopes are subjected to consistent selective
pressure from the host's immune system, leading to rapid
accumulation of amino acid changes, while other CTL
epitopes evolve under purifying selection pressure [9,10].
Furthermore, rapidly accumulating genetic diversity in the
global HIV-1 pandemic [11] underlies a great need to
develop vaccines that are protective against multiple subtypes and strains simultaneously.
The epitope-vaccine approach has been suggested as a
strategy to circumvent the rapid rate of mutations in HIV1 and the subsequent viral escape from the host's immune
system as well as the development of resistance to antiviral drugs [12-14]. The inclusion of CTL epitope
sequences in vaccines has several advantages, including a
possibility of targeting a majority of viral variants if highly
conserved epitopes are used. Likewise, when epitopes
from different genes or genomic regions are included in
the same vaccine, such multi-epitope vaccines can induce
broader cellular immune responses [15,16].
Several strategies can be used to develop multi-epitope
vaccines, including (a) the generation of tetramer epitope
vaccines with epitopes being chosen based on the presence of principal neutralizing determinant [12], (b) the
generation of synthetic peptides with prediction of the
candidate epitopes based on the peptide binding affinity
of anchor residues in silico, focusing on those capable of
binding to multiple HLA alleles [17], (c) the juxtaposition
of multiple HLA-DR-restricted HTL epitopes [18] with
epitope identification by screening of HIV-1 antigens for
peptides that contain the HLA-DR-supertype binding
motif [19]. However, inherent limitation of in-silico
epitope predictions is generating a rather large number of
initially predicted epitopes, many of which are false positives; and hence, there exists a need for subsequent experimental validation of many potential candidates [20-24].
Furthermore, because of the enormous genetic diversity of
HIV, some predicted epitope candidates may be specific to
only certain subtypes [21,25,26], whereas relying primarily on the extent of amino acid sequence conservation
does not determine the potential immunogenicity [21].
Other methods, such as artificial neural networks [27] and
hidden Markov models [28], also have limitations, such
as adjustable values whose optimal values are hard to find
initially, over fitting, overtraining and interpreting [29].
For example, in a study by Anderson et al. (2000) on
experimental binding of 84 peptides to class I MHC molecules [30], there was no correlation between predicted

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/6/1/62

versus experimental binding, and a high possibility of
false-negatives. Thus, in this study we develop a novel
strategy to identify best epitope candidates for multiepitope vaccines from the pool of experimentally wellsupported epitopes based on the association-rule mining
technique.
Briefly, an association rule mining technique, which is a
method that can detect association between items (frequent item sets) and formulate conditional implication
rules among them [31-33], is used to examine relationships between 218 "best-defined" CTL epitopes (from the
list of Frahm, Linde & Brander, 2007 [26]). Our results
show that some CTL epitopes are significantly associated
with each other so that they co-occur together in the
majority of the reference viral genomes including circulating recombinant forms. At least 23 association rules were
identified that involve CTL epitopes from 3 different
genes, Gag, Pol and Nef, respectively. We also identified
several combinations of 3 to 5 CTL epitopes that are frequently found together in the same viral genome despite
high mutation and recombination rates found in HIV-1
genomes, and thus, can be used as likely candidates for
multi-epitope vaccine development.

Materials and methods
HIV-1 genomic sequence data and alignment
Genomic nucleotide sequences of 9 protein-coding genes
of HIV-1 were collected for 62 HIV-1 reference genomes
from the 2005 subtype reference set of the HIV sequence
database by Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL)
[34,35] (Table 1). These included 44 non-recombinant
sequences from the groups M, N and O, and 18 circulating
recombinant forms (CRFs). The M group was comprised
of representatives of sub-subtypes A1, A2, F1 and F2, and
subtypes B, C, D, G, H, J, K, respectively, of approximately
4 representative sequences from each category. This set of
sequences was chosen since they allowed the diversity of
each subtype to be roughly the same as for all available
sequences in the database, similar to an effective population size. Moreover, they had full length genomes that
covered all genes and major geographical regions (for criteria of selection of reference sequences, refer to [35]).
Inclusion of CRFs allowed us to identify those highly conserved CTL epitopes that are shared between non-recombinant genomes and are also present in the majority of the
recombinant reference genomes. Viral sequences were
aligned at the nucleotide level as per amino acid alignment reconstructed with ClustalW, and were manually
checked afterwards [36].

The summary of the average numbers of breakpoints in
the CRF genomes was based on the breakpoint maps summarized at the HIV database at Los Alamos [37].

CTL epitopes
The set of 218 CTL epitopes, described as "the bestdefined HIV CTL epitopes" by Frahm, Linde & Brander
(2007) [26] that included only those epitopes supported
by strong experimental evidence in humans, was used.
These epitopes, together with their respective genomic
coordinates according to the reference HXB2 sequence
(GenBank accession number K03455) [38], are described
in Additional file 1.
Selecting epitopes for association rule mining
Of the 218 "best-defined" CTL epitopes, the subset of the
most evolutionary conserved epitopes that are present
across a majority of surveyed reference sequences was
included according to the following criteria: (a) The
epitope was present in at least one out of 62 reference
sequences. (b) If two or more epitopes were completely
overlapping with each other and there were no amino acid

sequence differences, the longer epitope was selected.
However, if overlapping epitopes harbored one or more
amino acid difference from each other, all such epitopes

Criteria for the inclusion of CTL epitopes. The longer
CTL epitope was selected from completely overlapping
epitopes if they did not harbor any amino acid sequence differences among them, whereas both epitopes were included
if at least one amino acid difference existed.

were included (Figure 1). Even if two epitopes overlapped
completely without any amino acid sequence differences
within the overlap portion, it is possible that differences
exist within the adjacent non-overlapping portions
because of the difference in the epitope lengths. In such
cases all epitopes were included. This step was taken to
avoid generation of redundant association rules that are
based on exactly the same amino acid sequences. Overall,
29 epitopes were removed from further analyses, resulting
in a list of 189 epitopes that were included in the study
(See Additional file 1 for details).
To determine whether the same associations exist among
non-recombinant and circulating recombinant forms
(CRFs), three data sets were created. The first sequence set
(designated later as "62-all") included all 62 HIV-1 reference sequences used in the study, the second set included
only 44 non-recombinant sequences ("44-non-CRFs")
and the third set included 18 CRFs (designated as "18CRFs"). Because of the requirement that an epitope be
present as a "perfect match" in at least one sequence as
described above, 1 and 29 epitopes were removed from
the epitope lists for the second and third data sets, respectively. This resulted in lists of 188 and 160 epitopes,
respectively (Additional file 1).
Additionally, one hundred "pseudo-datasets" of 62
sequences each (62 × 100) was created by randomly
selecting sequences from the original sequence set (random sampling with replacement). Similarly to the bootstrap test widely used in phylogenetics [39], these pseudosets were used as controls to determine the significance of
detected associations using the same threshold as the 62all data set (i.e., 75% support and 95% confidence), in
other words, whether identified associations in our original 62 sequence set could be attributed to the overrepresentation of certain sequence types by chance. The
number of epitopes analyzed in each data set is given in
Additional file 2. It should be noted that essentially the
same association rules were identified in the pseudo-datasets as they were in the 62-all data set, which is consistent
with the expectations that high values of support and confidence constraints used here already prune away most of
the insignificant rules [32].
Association rule mining
Association rule mining is a data mining technique that
discovers relationships (associations, or rules) that exist
within a data set [31-33,40]. One of the commonly
known applications of association rule mining is "market
basket" analysis [40-42]. However, in addition to marketing analysis, association rule mining has many useful
applications to answer biological problems, including the
discovery of relationships between genotypes and phenotypes in bacterial genomes [43], predicting drug resistance
in HIV [44], and predicting MHC-peptide binding [45]. In

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/6/1/62

this study, association rule mining was used to discover
novel relationships between CTL epitopes that consistently co-occur together in viral genomes despite high
mutation and recombination rates, so that such epitopes
can be used as promising candidates in the design of
multi-epitope vaccines.
Association rule mining was conducted using the Apriori
algorithm [41] implemented in the program WEKA
[40,46,47]. The initial minimum support was set at 0.75
and confidence at 0.95. The maximum number of rules
identified was set at 5,000 for the 62-All and 44-non-CRFs
data sets and at 50,000 for the 18-CRFs data set to ensure
that all association rules above the support and confidence thresholds are captured. The support level was set
rather high to include only associations among epitopes
that were present in at least 75% of the reference
sequences used. The confidence was set to 0.95 to generate only very strong associations, and all generated association rules were exhaustively enumerated and examined.
Once identified, association rules were examined to identify "unique" rules, i.e., rules that combine associations
between the same epitopes into a single, "unique" rule
regardless of the order of epitopes within a rule (i.e., A
occurs with B and B occurs with A are considered the same
"unique" rule) (Table 2 and Additional file 3).
Estimates of the nucleotide substitution rates
The relative degree of sequence divergence among reference sequences and different genomic regions was evaluated by comparing the number of synonymous and
nonsynonymous substitutions. In particular, the number
of synonymous nucleotide substitutions per synonymous
site (dS) and the number of nonsynonymous nucleotide
substitutions per nonsynonymous site (dN) were estimated by the Nei-Gojobori method [48] as implemented
in the MEGA4 program [49]. This simple method was
used because it is expected to have lower variance than
more complicated substitution models [39]. The standard
errors were estimated with 100 bootstrap replications.
Pairwise dN and dS values were estimated for the so-called
"associated" epitope regions (defined as epitopes that
were found to be involved in any association rule), nonassociated epitope regions (epitopes that were not
involved in any association rule) and non-epitope regions
(i.e., regions that did not harbor any CTL epitopes used in
study), respectively.

Results and discussion
Mining for association rules
In order to identify CTL epitope regions that consistently
co-occur together in the HIV-1 genomes, 189 CTL
epitopes were mapped in 62 HIV-1 reference sequences
(Table 1), where "perfect match" was recorded as "epitope
presence", while one or more amino acid differences

tive HIV sequences were considered as "epitope absence",
and association rule mining was applied to determine
whether certain CTL epitopes consistently co-occurred
together. Using the data mining tool WEKA [46,47], the
initial minimum support and confidence values were set
to 0.75 and 0.95, respectively, to ensure that we identified
only the most frequently co-occurring epitopes. In other
words, a minimum support value of 75% ensures that
only epitopes that are present as a "perfect match" in at
least 75% of the sequences are included in association
rules (e.g., epitope A is present in at least 46 sequences out
of 62). The support for the 18-CRFs data set was later
raised to 0.95 (i.e., even more conservative) to limit the
overall number of associations because this data set generated a lot more association rules with 75% support compared to the other data sets, as it had 31 CTL epitopes with
at least 75% support whereas those for the 62-All and 44non-CRFs data sets were 25 and 26, respectively. On the
other hand, a level of confidence set to 95% indicates that

the identified association rule (e.g., epitope A being associated with epitope B) will be present in at least 95% of
the sequences where epitope A occurs. In the case of 62
reference sequences, that means at least 44 reference
sequences had both epitopes present.
The results of the association rule mining are summarized
in the Table 2. Initially, 1961 association rules were
detected in the 62 sequences data set (1095 and 1867 for
the 44-non-CRFs and 18-CRFs, respectively), of them 484,
344 and 210 were association rules involving unique
combinations of epitopes (i.e., rules that A occurs with B
and B occurs with A were considered the same "unique"
rule), respectively. The majority of associations included 3
or 4 epitopes at a time; for example, the 62-all data set had
217 and 153 association rules involving 3 and 4 epitopes,
respectively. However, a substantial amount of association rules was found to involve larger numbers of
epitopes, 5 or 6 (Table 2). Among the unique epitope
Page 5 of 12

Retrovirology 2009, 6:62

associations, a majority of them involved CTL epitopes
harbored by the Gag and Pol genes for the 62-all sequence
set (364 and 472 association rules included epitopes from
the Gag and Pol genes, respectively), but only 52 association rules included an epitope from the Nef gene. Since
Gag and Pol are located in adjacent genomic positions
(and are somewhat overlapping), the physical proximity
of the genes in the genome may be responsible for the
existence of some association rules that involve epitopes
from both of these genes (i.e., where recombination did
not break up the association between epitopes). However,
given the extremely high recombination rate in HIV-1,
which was estimated to be as high as 2.8 crossovers per
genome per replication cycle [50], epitopes from genes
that are located far apart (such as Pol and Nef) would not
be expected to be involved in many association rules, particularly those that occur with high support and confidence. Notably, our results identified at least 23
associations that involved epitopes located in 3 different
genes, namely, Gag, Pol and Nef (shown in Figure 2). For
example, epitopes Gag SEGATPQDL, Pol KLVDFRELNK
and Nef FLKEKGGL were found to often co-occur in the

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/6/1/62

same genome (Figure 2, see also Additional file 3). Notably, among the associated epitopes that are located on different genes, none was recognized by the same HLA allele
within a genome or even by the alleles within the same
supertype [51]. In the 3-epitope example above, these
epitopes are recognized by the alleles HLA-B*4001,
A*0301 and B*0801, which belong to the B44, A03 and
B08 supertypes, respectively.
Overall, our results identified 358 association rules that
involved epitopes from two different genes (mostly Gag
and Pol) and 23 association rules that involve epitopes
from three different genes (Gag, Pol and Nef). The Venn
diagram shown on Figure 3 summarizes the distribution
of different association rules among combinations of
these three genes. As shown, the majority of all discovered
unique association rules involved CTL epitopes from Gag
and Pol, while among other categories of multi-gene association rules, majority involved combinations of epitopes
from Pol and Nef. Similar results were obtained with the
smaller 44-non-CRFs and 18-CRFs data sets, identifying
246 and 5 epitope associations from two and three genes,

Venn diagram showing the number of epitope association rules involving each gene. Out of the 484 unique
epitope associations, there were 9 associations in which
epitopes from the Gag gene only (shown in red) were
involved and 94 from the Pol gene only(blue). There was no
association in which epitopes from solely Nef (green) were
involved. There were 329 associations in which epitopes
from Gag and Pol took part, whereas in 26 associations
epitopes were only from the Nef and Pol genes, and in 3 associations epitopes were only from the Gag and Nef genes.
There were 23 associations in which epitopes from all three
genes were involved.

respectively, for the former data set, and 153 and 7 associations for the latter data set (Table 2, Additional file 3).
Each of the epitope associations involving three genes
were found to be present in more than 75% of the reference genomes, including all subtypes of the M group, N
and O groups as well as the recombinant forms. When the
N and O groups were excluded, the epitope associations
were found to be present in more than 80% of the reference sequences. As an aside, the N and O groups are
highly diverse viruses that represent only a small minority
of HIV infections in West and Central Africa [52,53] and
thought to originate in chimpanzee and gorilla zoonoses
[54,55]. Presence of epitope association rules involving
three genes is particularly notable for the18-CRFs data set,
because it included a rather broad representation of circulating recombinant forms that are by definition products
of recombination and often represent a complex mosaic
of genomic pieces from multiple subtypes. On average,
each recombinant subtype was inferred to have about 8
breakpoints (ranging from 2 to 16) across the entire
genome, and included genomic segments of at least 2, and
in some cases, 3 or more, distinct subtypes (as shown on
the breakpoints maps available at the HIV database at Los
Alamos). Furthermore, when the location of breakpoints
and nature of rearrangements were considered, only 3
recombinant subtypes out of 18 used here had these three
genes identified as originating from the same subtypes
(i.e., CRF14_BG, CRF15_01B and CRF16_A2D). Yet,
many of the associations found in larger data sets were
also found in the 18-CRFs set, indicating that the amino
acid segments that harbor these CTL epitopes are
extremely conserved across a broad range of HIV-1
genomes.

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/6/1/62

Interestingly, one of the frequently associated epitopes
found in three genes associations (Figure 2), Nef
FLKEKGGL (HLA-B*08-restricted epitope) [56,8], also
referred to as B8-FL8 epitope, is a known frequently targeted highly immunodominant epitope in HLA-B*08
individuals that often elicits a strong epitope-specific
CD8+ T-cell response [57,58]. This epitope has also been
shown to be targeted by specific T cell receptors that have
unusually long complementarity determining regions 3
(CDR3) and capable of recognizing the escape mutants
arising in that epitope, a response associated with slow
disease progression [58]. Furthermore, the strong amino
acid sequence conservation at this epitope region identified in our study is consistent with the clinical data that
indicated a rather limited capacity of the virus to tolerate
amino acid changes at that epitope, as evidenced by the
lack of amino acid variation in some patients with persistent and strong CTL response despite being infected for
over 13 years [8,58]. Overall, strong functional constraints
on the virus and lower fitness of escape mutants are likely
contributors to the high extent of sequence conservation
of B8-FL8 epitope, and hence, it represents a promising
vaccine candidate, although further studies are needed.
As Figure 2 shows, distribution of highly conserved
epitope regions that participate in associations spanning
three genes varied among and within genes. Notably, all
23 three-gene association rules included the same Nef
epitope (B8-FL8 FLKEKGGL). The Pol gene had the highest number of associated epitopes (9) that differ from
each other, while the Gag gene had 3 different epitopes
involved in multiple association rules. Some of these associations included epitopes from the same adjacent/overlapping regions, e.g., Gag GLNKIVRMY is associated with
the Pol IVTDSQYAL epitope and other adjacent/overlapping epitopes in at least 9 association rules (Figure 2).
Other epitopes, such as Gag GHQAAMQML, instead participate in association rules that involved multiple nonoverlapping epitope regions in the Pol gene. It is possible
that different mechanisms are responsible for long-term
evolutionary maintenance of different types of epitope
associations, such as those that involve CTL epitopes from
relatively closely located regions (within 200–300 codons
apart), as well as associations that include epitopes from
distantly located parts of the genome, although further
studies are necessary. Overall, this approach allows us to
identify co-evolving regions in viral genomes that are
highly conserved at the amino acid level and are subjected
to strong purifying selection eliminating the majority of
amino acid changes that may occur in such regions.
Selection at CTL epitopes involved in association rules
To assess the extent of evolutionary sequence conservation of the CTL epitopes that participated in the association rules, we compared the levels of nonsynonymous
(amino acid altering) and synonymous substitutions in
Page 7 of 12

Retrovirology 2009, 6:62

all pairwise comparisons of 62 HIV-1 genomes. The
results are shown in Table 3, which lists average pairwise
dN and dS values estimated for the epitope and nonepitope regions from the 62 HIV-1 reference genomic
sequences. Here, the epitope regions are divided into two
groups: (a) those epitopes that are involved in association
rules and (b) those not involved. In all pairwise comparisons, the overall substitution trend is that the number of
synonymous substitutions significantly exceeds that of
nonsynonymous substitutions (i.e., dS >> dN, paired t
test, p < 0.01). This indicates that purifying selection
indeed plays a major role in the evolution of both the CTL
epitopes and non-epitope regions, which is consistent
with our previous results [9,10]. However, when the relative magnitude of nonsynonymous and synonymous
changes was considered, epitopes that participated in
association rules were found to have significantly lower
dN values than either the other CTL epitopes or the nonepitope regions (ANOVA, p = 0.015), indicating that they
are much more conserved at the amino acid but not at the
nucleotide level. On the other hand, no significant differences were detected between dS values compared between
these categories (p > 0.2). Similar results were obtained
using nonparametric statistics (Kruskal-Wallis test, p =
0.002). These results indicate that purifying selection acting to preserve amino acid sequences of CTL epitopes is
operating more strongly on the CTL epitopes that are
found to be involved in association rules than on the nonassociated epitopes, perhaps, due to stronger functional
and structural constraints in these regions. However, further studies are necessary to determine the nature of these
constraints.
Significance of CTL epitope "participation" in the
association rules
By design, our study was focused on the identification of
highly supported association rules (support >= 75%), i.e.,
those that involve epitopes present in at least 75% of the
sequences analyzed. Notably, not all CTL epitopes that are
present in over 75% of sequences can be found in association rules (e.g., Gag CRAPRKKGC and Pol LVGPTPVNI
while occurring in over 75% of the analyzed sequences,
were not part of any association rule). As Table 4 shows,
CTL epitopes from about 15 non-overlapping genomic
regions participated in association rules; however, some

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/6/1/62

genomic regions contributed more than one epitope (generally, these are overlapping epitopes). We also used a
conservative level of confidence of 95% or higher, which
can be interpreted as follows: if epitopes A and B are
present together and are associated with epitope C with
confidence of 0.95, we can conclude that whenever there
are epitopes A and B in the same genome, epitope C will
appear in the same genome with 95% probability or
higher.
Overall, we were able to identify several highly conserved
epitopes that are relatively widely spread across the worldwide HIV-1 population, and present not only in nonrecombinant subtypes, but also in the circulating recombinant forms. Such highly conserved epitopes may be
considered promising candidates for multi-epitope vaccine design, as they are likely to be targeted in a majority
of HIV lineages, thereby increasing population coverage.
However, in addition to being highly conserved, there are
additional benefits in utilizing CTL epitopes identified as
participants in association rules (such as those depicted
on Figure 2). In particular, an association between
epitopes generally implies that if one epitope from the
rule is present in the viral genome, the other epitopes
from the rule will also be present with high likelihood.
Furthermore, because these epitopes may be located in
different genes – and are often far apart from each other –
a potential recombination – or a mutation – event may
remove only some but not all target epitopes, and thus
will only diminish the efficiency of a multi-epitope vaccine instead of completely disabling its action. Our earlier
studies have identified at least 10 CTL epitope regions that
exhibit evidence of persistent purifying selection (Piontkivska and Hughes 2004 [9], Table 2: http://jvi.asm.org/
cgi/content/full/78/21/11758/T2 therein). Of these
highly conserved epitopes, Pol epitope LFLDGIDKA (recognized by HLA-B81) is also found to be a part of several
association rules identified in this study, including association rules spanning three genes and four CTL epitopes
(in particular, 2 epitopes from Gag and 1 epitope from Pol
and Nef, respectively), and as such, represents a promising
candidate for multi-epitope vaccine development.
Because the HIV genomes and definitions of the CTL
epitopes were drawn from the reference sequences and the

These epitopes are harbored by 15 different protein-coding genomic regions. For each epitope and genomic region the number of "unique"
association rules (as defined in Table 2) is shown, as well as the corresponding HLA alleles that recognize that particular CTL epitope.
* HLA alleles as defined in the HIV Molecular Immunology Database, Los Alamos National Laboratory.

list of "best-defined" epitopes of the HIV Sequence and
HIV Immunology databases, respectively, neither
patient's HLA haplotype, stage of infection nor CTL
responses are known. However, some of the associated
epitopes have been shown to be immunogenic in acute
HIV-1 infection, particularly those participating in associations involving epitopes from three different genes,
while some others have been shown to be strongly immunogenic in drug-naive patients (Additional file 4). Furthermore, while some CTL epitopes may certainly be
prone to escape mutations when exposed to the immune
pressure elicited by the restricting HLA allele, the associated epitopes identified in this study are recognized by
different HLA alleles, with some combinations representing three different alleles from the same HLA locus. For

example, epitope association of Gag SEGATPQDL, Pol
LFLDGIDKA and Nef FLKEKGGL is recognized by the
HLA-B*4001, B*81 and B*0801 alleles, respectively, and
thus, it is unlikely to be recognized by all three alleles
within the same patient. On the other hand, a recent study
has shown that there is a promiscuity of some CTL
epitopes where epitope presentation and CTL recognition
can occur in the context of alternative, not restricting, HLA
class I alleles, often from different HLA supertypes [59]. As
shown in Table 4, five of the 22 associated epitopes have
been designated as promiscuous [per [59]], with at least
one promiscuous epitope identified in each gene (Gag, Pol
and Nef). Therefore, inclusion of these epitopes may
potentially enhance the efficiency of a multi-epitope vaccine across a broader range of host HLA haplotypes

(although "functionally homozygous" individuals who
express both original and alternative HLA alleles may be
at disadvantage [55,60]). Further studies are needed to
address the mechanisms of immune control of HIV infection through combinations of HLA alleles and CTL
epitopes, particularly, promiscuous epitopes.
While our results demonstrated presence of several highly
conserved – and identified to exist in association with
each other – CTL epitopes in multiple HIV-1 reference
genomes, including CRFs, the underlying functional significance of these regions for the virus remains poorly
understood. Very few of the epitope regions found in association rules had such molecular features as glycosylstion,
myristoylation, amidation, or phosphorylation sites. They
also lacked any cell attachment motif or Leucine Zipper
motif [61,62]. Yet, the highly conserved nature of these
CTL epitopes hints at major functional significance of
these regions. One possibility is that the strong sequence
conservation is driven by functional constraints related to
potential RNA secondary and tertiary structures formed by
genomic regions of these epitopes, individually or in combination with each other. In such case it may be expected
that the overall extent of sequence divergence will be
lower at these epitopes than elsewhere in the genome, and
indeed, both dN and dS values were found to be lower at
the associated epitopes than at the other epitopes or nonepitope regions (Table 3).

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/6/1/62

Our results revealed the presence of multiple associated
co-evolving CTL epitope regions in HIV-1 genomes that
are also significantly conserved across a broad range of
HIV-1 subtypes and sub-subtypes. However, further studies are needed to ascertain the efficiency of these associated epitopes in multi-epitope vaccines as well as to
uncover the underlying structural and/or functional constraints behind co-occurrences of the highly conserved
epitopes.

Conclusion
Application of association rule mining revealed that certain CTL epitope combinations (including epitopes from
three different genes) consistently co-occur in HIV-1
genomic sequences present in major geographic regions
around the world. Such epitopes that are both well supported by experimental evidence and highly conserved
across different non-recombinant and recombinant forms
of HIV-1 genomes can be considered as ideal candidates
for multi-epitope vaccines against HIV-1.

Authors' contributions
It is also noteworthy that some epitopes are not involved
in any association despite being present in more than
75% of the reference sequences, hinting at some underlying mechanism that holds the "associated epitopes"
together. It is possible that the associated epitopes from
different genes co-evolve together because of functional
and structural constraints due to protein-protein interactions that are necessary for many viral processes [63].
Since some of the HIV proteins are expressed as polyproteins (such as Gag-Pol) [64], regulation of polypeptide
processing in the cell is an important part of the viral life
cycle and is often mediated by interactions between
domains that belong to different processed proteins. For
example, within Gag-Pol several regions that are located
close to the N and C termini of protease (PR) have been
shown to influence PR activation [65]. Likewise, modulating reverse transcriptase (RT) activation has been shown
to have an effect on Gag-Pol interaction and polypeptide
processing [66], while interactions between C terminal
flexible loop of Nef and Gag-Pol polyprotein are essential
for HIV assembly [67]. While molecular mechanisms of
potential interactions involving associated epitope
regions are currently unknown, these regions represent
interesting candidates for future experimental studies to
elucidate these interactions and their functional significance.
