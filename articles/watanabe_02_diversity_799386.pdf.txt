Abstract
Background: Microorganisms inhabiting subterranean oil fields have recently attracted much
attention. Since intact groundwater can easily be obtained from the bottom of underground oilstorage cavities without contamination by surface water, studies on such oil-storage cavities are
expected to provide valuable information to understand microbial ecology of subterranean oil
fields.
Results: DNA was extracted from the groundwater obtained from an oil-storage cavity situated
at Kuji in Iwate, Japan, and 16S rRNA gene (16S rDNA) fragments were amplified by PCR using
combinations of universal and Bacteria-specific primers. The sequence analysis of 154 clones
produced 31 different bacterial sequence types (a unique clone or group of clones with sequence
similarity of > 98). Major sequence types were related to Desulfotomaculum, Acetobacterium,
Desulfovibrio, Desulfobacula, Zoogloea and Thiomicrospira denitrificans. The abundance in the
groundwater of bacterial populations represented by these major sequence types was assessed by
quantitative competitive PCR using specific primers, showing that five rDNA types except for that
related to Desulfobacula shared significant proportions (more than 1%) of the total bacterial rDNA.
Conclusions: Bacteria inhabiting the oil-storage cavity were unexpectedly diverse. A phylogenetic
affiliation of cloned 16S rDNA sequences suggests that bacteria exhibiting different types of energy
metabolism coexist in the cavity.

Background
Underground cavities have been used for long-term storage of crude oil in several countries, and one of such facilities is situated at Kuji in Iwate, Japan. These cavities have
been constructed in groundwater-rich rocky strata, where
high groundwater pressure confines the stored oil in the
cavities [1]. Consequently, groundwater migrates into and
accumulates at the bottom of a cavity (cavity groundwater), and this cavity groundwater is discharged to maintain
the oil storage capacity of the cavity (this system has been

detailed in our previous study [1]). Our previous study [1]
has also shown active growth of microorganisms in
groundwater accumulating at the bottom of the cavities;
the total count of microorganisms in the cavity groundwater was constantly more than 106 cells per ml (densities
100 times higher than those in groundwater around the
cavities). This habitat can be characterized by (i) immediate contact with a large quantity of crude oil and (ii) an excess of electron donors for microbial growth (i.e.,
hydrocarbons) but a shortage of electron acceptors [1].

These characteristics may be similar to those of microbial
habitats associated with subterranean oil reservoirs,
which have recently attracted much attention in microbiology [2–6]. Since groundwater can easily be obtained
from the bottom of the oil-storage cavities using standing
sampling facilities without its contamination by surface
water [1], studies on the oil-storage cavity are considered
to provide valuable information to understand the microbial ecology of subterranean oil fields.
Our previous study applied rRNA approaches, namely
cloning and sequencing of 16S rRNA gene fragments, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and fluorescent in
situ hybridization (FISH), to analyze bacterial populations that occurred in the cavity groundwater obtained at
Kuji [1]. As a result, a group of bacteria (called cluster-1
bacteria) affiliated with the Thiovulum subgroup in the ε
subclass of the class Proteobacteria was consistently detected as a major population. Quantitative comparison of the
results of these approaches, however, revealed a large bias
associated with the cloning and sequencing approach; it
was thus considered that the bacterial biodiversity has not
sufficiently been assessed yet.
The present study was conducted to obtain a more reliable
view on the bacterial biodiversity in the Kuji cavity
groundwater. For this purpose, this study employed widely used universal primers [7] and a recently-modified Bacteria-specific primer [8] for PCR amplification of 16S
rRNA gene (16S rDNA) fragments from the cavity groundwater, followed by cloning and sequencing. In addition,
in order to quantitatively assess results of the cloning approach, competitive PCR (cPCR) assays were developed
for some of abundantly obtained 16S rDNA types that
were considered important for anaerobic petroleum degradation.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/2/23

libraries of clones, namely 341/1492 and 515/1492 (designated according to the primers used, see Table 1), were
constructed. Nucleotide sequences of a total of 154 clones
were determined, which included 81 clones from library
341/1492 and 73 clones from 515/1492 (Table 2). Results
of the sequence analysis are summarized in Table 2. As
shown in this table, 31 different sequence types (a unique
clones or group of clones with sequence similarity of >
0.98) affiliated with the Bacteria were obtained. The database search (Table 2) and phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1)
identified the phylogenetic positions of these sequence
types. The sequence types containing more than several
clones were related to Desulfotomaculum, Acetobacterium,
Desulfovibrio, Desulfobacula, Zoogloea and Thiomicrospira
denitrificans (this sequence type was affiliated with the
cluster-1 bacteria [1]). Some sequence types showed homology to 16S rDNA clones obtained from contaminated
groundwater and anaerobic consortia degrading petroleum constituents (Table 2).
Quantification of rDNA copies by competitive PCR
It has been suggested that the PCR-amplification and
cloning procedures may cause biases towards some specific 16S rDNA types [1,15]. In order to examine the abundance of bacteria represented by the major sequence types
(those related to Desulfotomaculum, Acetobacterium, Desulfovibrio, Desulfobacula, Zoogloea and Thiomicrospira denitrificans), competitive PCR (cPCR) assays using specific
primers were developed (Table 3). Fig. 2a shows that the
PCR assays successfully amplified the target bands from
the cavity groundwater. Results of cPCR for the groundwater obtained in 1999 and 2001 are shown in Fig. 2b. In the
two groundwater samples, rDNA copies of the cluster-1
bacteria were most abundant, and those related to Desulfotomaculum, Acetobacterium, Desulfovibrio and Zoogloea
also shared significant proportions (more than 1%) of the
total bacterial rDNA copies.

Results
FISH
In order to examine the abundance in the cavity groundwater of microorganisms affiliated with the Bacteria, FISH
using probe EUB338 (Table 1) was carried out. The result
was compared with that of FISH using an Archaea-specific
probe, ARCH915 (Table 1). In the groundwater sample
obtained in 1999, EUB338-labeled cells represented
53.5% ± 3.5% (mean ± standard deviation) of the DAPIstained cells, while ARCH915-labeled cells represented
8.4% ± 1.8%. The FISH results for the cavity groundwater
obtained in 2001 were almost the same. The result indicates that microorganisms affiliated with the Bacteria are
the major constituents in the cavity groundwater.
Analyses of cloned 16S rDNA fragments
The 16S rDNA fragments amplified by PCR from groundwater obtained in 1999 were cloned into E. coli, and two

Discussion
The present study used the two combinations of PCR
primers for amplifying 16S rDNA fragments from the cavity groundwater. The sequence analysis of the amplified
fragments suggests that the bacterial diversity in the cavity
groundwater is much larger than the diversity found in
our previous study [1]. The present study abundantly detected the sequence types related to Desulfotomaculum, Acetobacterium, Desulfovibrio, Desulfobacula, Zoogloea and
Thiomicrospira denitificans, while major 16S rDNA sequences obtained in our previous study were solely affiliated with the ε-Proteobacteria. This comparison clearly
indicates that methods employed in the molecular ecological approaches largely affect the results obtained. Differences in the methods employed in these two studies
included primers used for PCR amplification of 16S rDNA
fragments from the groundwater DNA and selection of E.

coli clones harboring groundwater 16S rDNA fragments.
The PCR primers used in our previous study were two Bacteria-specific primers (called 8f and 1546r [1]). We assume
that organisms undetected in our previous study have 16S
rDNA sequences that include mismatches to these primers, since this study did not determine sequences of the 5'and 3'-end regions of 16S rDNA where 8f and 1546r exist.
In addition to the primer selection, different from our previous study [1], the present study did not employ the β-galactosidase colony screening when selecting E. coli clones,
because it has been reported that the vector containing a
DNA fragment up to 2 kb in-frame produces a blue colony. These two modifications may have circumvented the
bias toward the ε-Proteobacteria, which occurred in our
previous study [1].

For estimating the abundance of bacterial populations
represented by the major sequence types, this study employed cPCR assays. We did not use FISH, because a possible bias that causes the underestimation of slowgrowing bacteria has been suggested [1]. Besides, in the
present study, FISH with the Bacteria- and Archaea-specific
probes detected only 60% in total of the DAPI-stained
cells; in addition, a large portion of labeled cells exhibited
weak signals. One possible explanation for this result
would be that the probes used (e.g., EUB338) failed to detect some phylogenetic groups of microorganisms. The
utility of cPCR for this purpose has been demonstrated in
several studies [16,17], while attention should be paid to
the variation in the number of 16S rDNA copies in a bacterial cell. For example, some Clostridium strains (affiliated

with the low G+C gram positive bacteria) have been
known to harbor more than 10 rDNA copies per cell
[18,19], while the mean copy number in whole-genomeanalyzed bacteria is 3.6 [20]. We assume that cPCR may
have overestimated the Acetobacterium rDNA copies, since
Acetobacterium belongs to the Clostridiaceae. In contrast,
rDNA copy numbers per cell of bacteria related to the other major sequence types were not so different from the
mean value for all bacteria [20]. We therefore consider
that the results of cPCR reflected the abundance in the cavity groundwater of the cluster-1 bacteria and those related
to Desulfotomaculum, Desulfovibrio and Zoogloea. Comparison of the cloning and cPCR results indicated that relative
abundances determined by these two methods were inconsistent with each other in several cases (Table 2 and
Figure 2). Furthermore, clones obtained in abundance in
one library were minorities in another library in many cas-

es (Table 2). These results suggest that the rDNA cloning
approach employed in this study also included some biases.
Environmental rDNA sequencees have been used to infer
some properties of the organisms that they represent
[1,7,21], although this type of analysis is reliable only if
some common properties can be recognized for phylogenetically related organisms. In the present study, we assume that the organism represented by sequence types
KU21 and KU25 are acetogens [22], and those represented
by KB1, KB14, KB33 and KB47 are likely sulfate-reducing
bacteria [23]. KU34 is closely related to the genus Zoogloea
that has been known to grow by denitrification under
anaerobic conditions [24]. The Zoogloea belong to the
Rhodocyclus group in the β subclass of the class Proteobacteria, which also includes the genera Rhodocyclus and Azo-

clone KU34 are assumed to be capable of denitirfication.
Sequence types KU26 and KB13 are related to the genus
Desulfotomaculum that belongs to the Syntrophomonas/
Thermoanaerobacter group in the low G+C gram-positive
bacteria [25]. Typical members of this group are sulfate-reducing bacteria represented by Desulfotomaculum spp.
[26], fermentative bacteria represented by Sporotomaculum
hydroxybenzoicum[27] and acid-oxidizing syntrophs represented by Syntrophomonas spp. [28]. It is likely that organisms represented by KU26 and KB13 were engaged in
some steps in organic compound decomposition. Similar
types of bacteria, including δ-Proteobacteria, ε-Proteobacteria and low G+C gram-positive bacteria, have been detected by rDNA cloning analyses of mesophilic oil reservoirs
in Canada [3], while β-Proteobacteria were not detected
from there. We thus assume that understanding physiology of organisms represented by clone KU34 would provide valuable information regarding differences of
ecosystem functions in these two subsurface oil fields.

We have recently isolated bacterial strains that belonged
to the cluster-1 bacteria [Kodama, Y. and Watanabe, K.
Unpublished results]. It has been found that these strains
are capable of anaerobic chemolithotrophic growth by oxidizing reduced sulfur species (sulfide, elemental sulfur
and thiosulfate) coupled to nitrate reduction. This finding
suggests that this group of bacteria mainly consumed nitrate that was supplied by groundwater flowing into the
oil-storage cavities.

The present study unveiled the large diversity of bacteria
in the cavity groundwater. The phylogenetic affiliation of
cloned 16S rDNA sequences suggests that bacteria exhibiting different types of energy metabolisms coexist as major proportions. This finding is considered interesting,
because the chemical analyses of the groundwater have
suggested that nitrate reduction is the major electron accepting process [1]. In particular, although sulfate was not
significantly consumed [1] and sulfide was always undetectable (below 0.01 mg per liter [unpublished data]) in
the cavity groundwater pool, the results of the present
study indicate that sulfate-reducing bacteria were present
at significant levels. One possible explanation for these
findings would be the existence of a sulfur cycle in the cavity groundwater that involves sulfate reducers and anaerobic sulfur oxidizers that regenerated sulfate from sulfide.
We assume that similar sulfur cycles may operate in subterranean oil fields, since sulfate-reducing bacteria have
been isolated from subterranean oil fields whose formation water contained very low concentrations of sulfate
[29,30]. In order to elucidate ecological niches and interactions among these bacteria, their isolation and physiological analyses in axenic cultures are needed. These

studies will draw novel insights into the ecological interactions among microorganisms in subterranean oil fields.

Methods
Groundwater samples
The cavity groundwater was obtained in March 1999 and
July 2001 from the TK101 underground crude oil storage
cavity situated at Kuji in Iwate, Japan. Characteristics of
the groundwater were reported previously [1].
Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)
Rhodamine-labeled oligonucleotide probes, EUB338 and
ARCH915 (Table 3) were used for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Microbial cells in groundwater were
collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, suspended in phosphate-buffered saline [31], and fixed in a
4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde solution for 5 h at 0°C.
The cells were attached to gelatin-coated slides [31] and
dehydrated by sequential washes in 50, 80, and 98% (vol/
vol) ethanol (3 min each). Subsequently, 8 µl of hybridization solution (0.9 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.2],
0.01% [wt/vol] sodium dodecyl sulfate and formamide at
a concentration [wt/vol] of 30% for EUB338 or 35% for
ARCH915) containing 50 ng of probe was added to each
hybridization well. It was incubated at 40°C (EUB338) or
46°C (ARCH915) for 3 h in a humid chamber. Slides were
washed in the hybridization solution at 42°C (EUB338)
or 48°C (ARCH915) for 20 min before all cells on the
slide were stained with 4',6'-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) [1]. More than 1,000 DAPI-stained cells were
counted to determine the ratio of probe-labeled cells to
DAPI-stained cells. Slides were prepared in triplicate.

PCR amplification, cloning and sequencing of 16S rDNA
fragments
DNA was extracted from the groundwater as described
previously [1]. PCR amplification of 16S rDNA fragments
was performed using either I-341f or 515f as a forward
primer and 1492r as a reverse primer (Table 1). A PCR solution (50 µl) contained 1.25 U of Taq DNA polymerase
(Amplitaq Gold; Applied Biosystems), 10 mM Tris-HCl
(pH 8.3), 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.001% (wt/vol)
gelatin, each deoxynucleoside triphosphate at a concentration of 200 µM, 50 pmol of each primer and 10 ng of
DNA. The amplification conditions were as follows: 10
min of activation of the polymerase at 94°C, followed by
30 cycles consisting of 1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 50°C, and
2 min at 72°C, and finally 10 min of extension at 72°C.
Amplified fragments were purified by electrophoresis,
ligated into the pGEM-T vector (Promega) and cloned
into Escherichia coli as described previously [1]. Vectorharboring clones were selected on Luria-Bertani plates
[32] supplemented with ampicillin (50 µg ml-1). PCR-amplified 16S rDNA fragments were recovered from colonies
by PCR using primers T7W and SP6W (the primers targeted the pGEM-T vector sequences flanking the insertion,
see Table 1) as described previously [1]. Clones containing appropriate sizes of the insertion were selected by the
electrophoresis analysis, and their nucleotide sequences
were determined as described previously [1].
Sequence analysis
Database searches with 16S rDNA sequences were conducted by using the BLAST program [33] and the GenBank
database. The profile alignment technique of ClustalW
version 1.7 [34] was used to align the sequences, and the
alignments were refined by visual inspection; secondary
structures were considered for the refinement analysis

[35]. A phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighborjoining method [36]using the njplot software in ClustalW, version 1.7. Nucleotide positions at which any sequence had an ambiguous base were not included in the
phylogenetic calculations. Checks for chimeric sequences
were conducted by using the chimera check in the RDP
database [25].
cPCR
The primers used for cPCR (Table 1) were selected or designed by comparing the 16S rDNA sequences obtained in
this study and those stored in the RDP database [25]. The
specificity of the primers thus obtained was checked by using the probe match program in the RDP database [25].
Competitor fragments were produced by using a competitive DNA construction kit (Takara Shuzo). The composition of PCR solution was described above except for the
competitor fragment being added at a known copy
number. The PCR conditions used were as follows: 10
min of activation of the polymerase at 94°C, followed by
30 cycles consisting of 1 min at 94°C, 1 min at the annealing temperatures described Table 3, and 2 min at 72°C,
and finally 10 min of extension at 72°C. Two microliters
of the PCR product was electrophoresed through a 1.5%
(wt/vol) agarose gel with TBE buffer, and the gel was photographed after it was stained with SYBR Gold (FMC Bioproducts). The band intensities of the target and
competitor fragments were quantified by using the Multianalyst software supplied with Gel Doc 2000 (Bio-rad). A
copy number of the target 16S rDNA fragment was estimated by considering the band intensity, length of the
fragment and copy number of the competitor as described
by Lee et al. [37].
