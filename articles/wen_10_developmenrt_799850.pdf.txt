Abstract
Background: Jatropha curcas L. has attracted a great deal of attention worldwide, regarding its potential as a new
biodiesel crop. However, the understanding of this crop remains very limited and little genomic research has been
done. We used simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers that could be transferred from Manihot esculenta (cassava) to
analyze the genetic relationships among 45 accessions of J. curcas from our germplasm collection.
Results: In total, 187 out of 419 expressed sequence tag (EST)-SSR and 54 out of 182 genomic (G)-SSR markers
from cassava were polymorphic among the J. curcas accessions. The EST-SSR markers comprised 26.20%
dinucleotide repeats, 57.75% trinucleotide repeats, 7.49% tetranucleotide repeats, and 8.56% pentanucleotide
repeats, whereas the majority of the G-SSR markers were dinucleotide repeats (62.96%). The 187 EST-SSRs resided
in genes that are involved mainly in biological and metabolic processes. Thirty-six EST-SSRs and 20 G-SSRs were
chosen to analyze the genetic diversity among 45 J. curcas accessions. A total of 183 polymorphic alleles were
detected. On the basis of the distribution of these polymorphic alleles, the 45 accessions were classified into six
groups, in which the genotype showed a correlation with geographic origin. The estimated mean genetic diversity
index was 0.5572, which suggests that our J. curcas germplasm collection has a high level of genetic diversity. This
should facilitate subsequent studies on genetic mapping and molecular breeding.
Conclusion: We identified 241 novel EST-SSR and G-SSR markers in J. curcas, which should be useful for genetic
mapping and quantitative trait loci analysis of important agronomic traits. By using these markers, we found that
the intergroup gene diversity of J. curcas was greater than the intragroup diversity, and that the domestication of
the species probably occurred partly in America and partly in Hainan, China.

Background
Jatropha curcas L. is a perennial, monoecious shrub that
belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family. The species is
native to America but is distributed widely in the tropics
[1,2]. Wild or semicultivated types of J. curcas can grow
well under all unfavorable climatic and soil conditions
[3]. The seeds of J. curcas contain 40-45% oil [4-6] with
a high percentage of monounsaturated oleic and polyunsaturated linoleic acid. The seed oils can be classified as
semi-drying [7]. In recent years, the economic importance of J. curcas for the production of biodiesel fuel
has been increasingly recognized [8].

To use J. curcas for producing biofuel, it is crucial to
develop varieties with a high seed yield and a high oil
content that are adapted well to varied conditions [9].
In recent years, J. curcas germplasm has been collected
and analyzed in Brazil, India, Indonesia, and China
[10,11]. J. curcas has a heterozygous genome, so conventional breeding programs for its improvement might not
be effective. Hence, it is likely that genomics-based
breeding strategies need to be used. However, the
genetic map of J. curcas is not well-developed and very
limited information is available with respect to molecular markers. The traditional methods of developing
simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers are usually timeconsuming and labor-intensive. However, an alternative
strategy has been developed that uses comparative

genomics to identify SSR markers. This strategy has
been used successfully in barley [12] and Brassica [13].
In the study reported herein, we selected 419
expressed sequence tag (EST)-SSR and 182 genomic
(G)-SSR primer pairs that had been developed for Manihot esculenta (cassava), which also belongs to the
Euphorbiaceae family, and investigated whether they
could be transferred to J. curcas. Firstly, these primer
pairs were tested using five accessions of J. curcas. The
primer pairs that produced specific amplicons were then
tested further. Finally, we used the transferable markers
to analyze the genetic diversity of our collection of
J. curcas accessions.

Results
Identification of EST-SSRs and G-SSRs for use in J. curcas

Five accessions of J. curcas were used to test the transferability of 419 EST-SSR and 182 G-SSR primer pairs
between cassava and J. curcus. Among these primers,
234 (55.85%) EST-SSR and 68 (37.36%) G-SSR primer
pairs produced amplicons, but only 187 (44.63%) ESTSSRs and 54 (29.67%) G-SSRs were polymorphic among
the five accessions (Fig.1). For each of the 241 EST-SSR
and G-SSR markers in J. curcas, the name, sequence of
the forward and reverse primers, the repeat type,
annealing temperature, and expected size of the PCR
products are listed in additional file 1.
Characteristics of the EST-SSR and G-SSR markers and
relevant genes in J. curcas

Microsatellites or SSRs are regions in the genome of
tandemly repeated DNA segments, with each segment
comprising up to six bases. Analysis of the nucleotide
sequences of the EST- and G-SSRs showed that, in
J. curcas, the EST-SSRs corresponded to 57.75% trinucleotide repeats, 26.20% dinucleotide repeats, 8.56% pentanucleotide repeats, and 7.49% tetranucleotide repeats.
In contrast, the G-SSRs were composed mainly of dinucleotide repeats (62.96%) (Table 1).
A BLAST search of the GenBank database was performed using the sequences of the 187 EST-SSRs. The
functions of the ESTs were then clustered according to

the general functional categories in the KOG (Eukaryotic Orthologous Groups of Proteins) database. A general
functional classification of the EST-SSRs is shown in
Fig. 2. Out of the 187 unique ESTs, 184 were annotated
and they were classified into more than 55 categories.
Many ESTs were found in several categories. The five
main categories, which contained 137 of the ESTs, were
biological processes, cellular processes, metabolic processes, cellular metabolic processes, and primary metabolic processes.
Assessment of genetic diversity in J. curcas

Thirty-six EST-SSRs and 20 G-SSRs were used to estimate the genetic diversity of 45 accessions of J. curcas.
A total of 216 alleles were identified, and 183 (84.72%)
of them were polymorphic. The sizes of the amplicons
for the EST-SSRs and G-SSRs ranged from 120 to 600
bp. The 36 EST-SSRs generated 152 alleles, of which
128 (84%) were polymorphic, whereas the 20 G-SSRs
produced 64 alleles, of which 55 (86%) were polymorphic. The number of alleles for each G-SSR ranged
from one to six with a mean of 3.20; in contrast, the
number of alleles for each EST-SSR ranged from one to
nine with a mean of 4.22. Therefore, more alleles were
obtained with the EST-SSRs than with the G-SSRs.
Genotyping data that were obtained for all 183 polymorphic alleles were used to estimate pairwise similarity
comparisons among these accessions. The similarity
coefficient values of the phenogram ranged from 0.55 to

0.92 with a mean of 0.76 (Fig. 3). The 45 accessions
clustered into six groups: group I, which comprised
seven accessions from Indonesia and four from South
America; group II, which comprised three accessions
from Grenada, one from South America, and three from
Yunnan, China; Group III, in which all four accessions
were from Hainan, China; Group IV, which comprised
four accessions from Yunnan, China plus three American clones; Group V, which consisted of two accessions
from Indonesia, two from Grenada, one from America,
and one from Hainan, China; and Group VI, which
comprised four clones from Hainan, China, three from
Grenada, and one from Yunnan, China. The results suggested that, in general, the genotypes of the J. curcas
accessions are correlated with their geographic origins,
although some crosses had occurred.
The parameters of genetic diversity between and
within the five geographic groups (Table 2) were estimated using all 183 EST-SSR and G-SSR polymorphic
alleles. The genetic diversity index ranged from 0.4099
to 0.5022 with an average of 0.5572, which suggested
that the collection had a broad genetic background,
although the level of genetic diversity was higher among
the accessions from America and Yunnan, China. The
total gene diversity (Ht = 0.3819 ± 0.0197) was higher
than the gene diversity within groups (Hs = 0.3108 ±
0.0158), which indicated that the genetic diversity
between groups is greater than that within groups. The

coefficient of gene differentiation (Gst) was 0.1861,
which indicated that the level of genetic differentiation
among the five groups was relatively high. The gene
flow index (Nm) was 2.18, which indicated that high
levels of gene flow occurred during the domestication of
J. curas.
The genetic similarity matrix that was obtained from
Jaccard’s similarity coefficient was subjected to principal
coordinates analysis (PCA). The results indicated that all
45 accessions could be divided into three categories
(Fig. 4). Category I contained the most accessions and
they came from all five areas. Category II included eight
accessions in total: three from Grenada, two from Indonesia, two from Hainan, and one from America. Category III contained four accessions from Hainan, two
from Grenada, and one from Yunnan. Category I
included many accessions from different areas, and
therefore demonstrated the weak geographic differentiation in the population; in other words, the observed
genetic diversity was due mainly to original evolution.
The category II and category III clusters revealed that
the phylogenetic characteristics of J. curcas from South
America, where J. curcas originated, and from Hainan in
China, where the species was domesticated less than
300 years ago, were very similar.

Discussion
Development of molecular markers in J. curcas

It was crucial to develop a sufficient number of speciesspecific markers to enable the fingerprinting and genetic

mapping of J. curcas; in rice and soybean, for example,
more than 10,000 SSR and SNP markers are available
[14,15]. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD),
inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers have been
used to evaluate genetic diversity and for fingerprinting
in accessions of J. curcas and related species [11,16-18].
Up to now, only 12 SSR markers had been developed
for Jatropha (they are polymorphic in six species of
Jatropha) [19], and no genetic map of Jatropha has been
reported. The transferable SSRs identified in the present
study should enable the genetic diversity, elite clones,
and evolution of J. curcas to be assessed, and a linkage
map to be constructed.
Transferability of EST-SSRs and G-SSRs from cassava

The development of EST-SSR markers was particularly
attractive because they represent coding regions of the
genome. It has been reported that EST-derived SSRs
and G-SSRs show a considerable degree of transferability to related species [20-24]. In the present study, we
observed a high level of transferability from cassava to
J. curcas; the level of transferability was higher for ESTSSRs (44.63%) than for G-SSRs (29.67%). This result was
consistent with that reported for wheat and related species [25]. In several studies, the level of transferability of
G-SSRs was found to be only 20-30% [26-29]. The
higher levels of transferability of EST-SSRs than of
G-SSRs reflect the conserved nature of coding sequences
as compared with non-coding genomic DNA, and the

Wen et al. BMC Research Notes 2010, 3:42

fact that the mutation frequency of EST sequences is
lower than that of genomic DNA sequences. These
results demonstrate the potential value of EST-SSR markers for the development of genetic maps, assessment of
genetic diversity, and marker-assisted selection (MAS)
breeding in J. curcas, all of which would benefit comparative mapping and analysis of the comparative functions of genes among the economic species in the
Euphorbiaceae family. Our finding that the majority of
transferable EST-SSRs were trinucleotide repeats agreed
with previous studies [21,30-32], and can be explained
by the suppression of non-trimeric SSRs in coding
regions due to the risk of frameshift mutations, which
might occur with non-trimeric microsatellites [33-36].
Collection of germplasm and evaluation of genetic
diversity

Gst and Nm showed that some differentiation occurred
in each geographic group.

Conclusion
We developed a set of 241 SSR primer pairs for use in
J. curcas. Of these markers, 187 EST-SSRs should be useful
for genetic mapping and quantitative trait loci analysis of
important agronomic traits. Fifty-six EST-SSRs and
G-SSRs were used successfully to analyze genetic diversity
in 45 accessions of J. curcas. The accessions analyzed
showed a broad genetic background with an average
genetic diversity index of 0.5572. The intergroup genetic
diversity was larger than the intragroup diversity, and
domestication had taken place in both America and
Hainan, China.
Methods

Several projects to collect germplasm have been carried
out in Brazil [37], India [38], and China [39], but systematic work on the collection of germplasm and its
evaluation is still in its infancy. The low genetic variability found among accessions of J. curcas from Africa and
Asia [11,16,17] has demonstrated the need for new
sources of genetic variation in J. curcas that could be
used in breeding programs. Such sources of genetic variation have been identified in Latin America, especially
in Guatemala [40]. In the present study, high levels of
genetic diversity were revealed in the 45 Jatropha accessions analyzed with the 56 EST-SSR and G-SSR primer
pairs that were utilized. The accessions from South
America, Yunnan (China), and Indonesia showed higher
levels of genetic variation than the other two geographic
regions (Grenada and Hainan, China). In particular, the
collections from Yunnan (China) could be used to
enrich the genetic background of J. curcas for breeding.

Plant material

Five J. curcas accessions, which corresponded to JI-1
(Indonesia), JA-1(America), JG-1 (Grenada), JYC-1(Yunnan, China), and JHC-1(Hainan, China), were used to
test the suitability of the cassava SSR markers by PCR.
To analyze the genetic diversity of J. curcas, 45
accessions were chosen, nine from each of the five
above-mentioned regions (Table 3). All the materials
were obtained from the germplasm collection of the
Institute of Tropical Biosciences & Biotechnology,
Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences,
Haikou, China. This collection contains 154 J. curcas
accessions, which cover most of the Chinese collections
as well as accessions from eight other countries: Brazil,
Columbia, Grenada, Thailand, Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, and Nigeria. Total genomic DNA was isolated
from young leaves by the modified CTAB method as
described by Doyle and Doyle [41]. The genomic DNA

amplification.
Design of EST-SSR and G-SSR primers and validation in
J. curcas

A total of 419 EST-SSR primers that had been developed for cassava in our laboratory [42] and 182 G-SSR
primers [43] were synthesized and used. Amplification
by PCR was performed in a 20-μl reaction mixture that
contained 50 ng template DNA, 1× PCR buffer (20 mM
Tris pH 9.0, 100 mM KCl, 3.0 mM MgCl2), 400 μM of
each of the four dNTPs, 0.4 μM of each of the forward
and reverse primers, and one unit of Taq DNA polymerase. The following PCR conditions were used: 94°C
for 1 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 4557°C for 1 min, 72°C for 1 min, and 10 min at 72°C for
the final extension. PCR products were separated on a
2% agarose gel, and visualized using SYBR Green http://
www.Genecopoeia.com.
Putative functional annotation of EST-SSRs

To assess the putative function of the EST-SSRs developed here, a BLASTX search of the GenBank nonredundant database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST was
performed using the 187 ESTs that contained polymorphic microsatellites. The threshold for a significant
BLAST hit was set at a bit score greater than 80 bits.
Functional categories were assigned on the basis of the
BLAST searches using a specially formatted database of
the Eukaryotic Orthologous Groups of proteins (KOG).
Analysis of genetic diversity

The polymorphic alleles obtained with each primer pair
were scored for their presence (1) or absence (0). From
the data matrix, a dendrogram was constructed using
the unweighted pair group method using arithmetic
averages (UPGMA), the similarity coefficient, and the
software NTSYS-pc2.1 [44]. The binary data were also
subjected to PCA to investigate the structure of our collection. The genetic diversity parameters of each geographic group, which included the percentage of
polymorphic loci (PLP), observed number of alleles per
locus (na), effective number of alleles per locus (ne),
Nei’s gene diversity (h), Shannon’s information index (I),
Gst, and Nm, were calculated by POPGENE 32 [45].
