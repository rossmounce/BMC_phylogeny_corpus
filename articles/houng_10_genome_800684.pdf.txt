Abstract
Background: Human adenovirus 14 (HAdV-14) is a recognized causative agent of epidemic febrile respiratory
illness (FRI). Last reported in Eurasia in 1963, this virus has since been conspicuously absent in broad surveys, and
was never isolated in North America despite inclusion of specific tests for this serotype in surveillance methods. In
2006 and 2007, this virus suddenly emerged in North America, causing high attack rate epidemics of FRI and, in
some cases, severe pneumonias and occasional fatalities. Some outbreaks have been relatively mild, with low rates
of progression beyond uncomplicated FRI, while other outbreaks have involved high rates of more serious
outcomes.
Methodology and Findings: In this paper we present the complete genomic sequence of this emerging
pathogen, and compare genomic sequences of isolates from both mild and severe outbreaks. We also compare
the genome sequences of the recent isolates with those of the prototype HAdV-14 that circulated in Eurasia
30 years ago and the closely related sequence of HAdV-11a, which has been circulating in southeast Asia.
Conclusions: The data suggest that the currently circulating strain of HAdV-14 is closely related to the historically
recognized prototype throughout its genome, though it does display a couple of potentially functional mutations
in the fiber knob and E1A genes. There are no polymorphisms that suggest an obvious explanation for the
divergence in severity between outbreak events, suggesting that differences in outcome are more likely
environmental or host determined rather than viral genetics.

Introduction
Adenoviruses are double-stranded DNA viruses. The 52
recognized serotypes of human adenovirus (HAdV)
cause a broad range of symptoms: community-acquired
gastrointestinal, conjunctival, and febrile respiratory illness (FRI; both upper and lower respiratory tract),
hemorrhagic cystitis associated with bone marrow transplant, hepatic and urinary tract infections, and perhaps
even obesity [[1-4], http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
ICTVdb/Ictv/index.htm].

The 10 serotypes of HAdV associated with FRI and
pneumonia are grouped into 3 species, B (including subspecies B1 and B2), C and E, on the basis of hemagglutination and phylogenetic criteria [5-9]. HAdV-1, 2, 5, and
6, belonging to species C, cause generally endemic patterns of FRI in children and young adults [8,10,11]. In
contrast, HAdV-4 (the sole serotype of species E) and
the remaining respiratory species B serotypes (HAdV-3,
7, 11, 14, 16, and 21), often cause distinctive outbreaks
of FRI, conjunctivitis, and pneumonia in crowded civilian populations such as dorms, public swimming pools,
and boarding schools [7,8]. In the absence of vaccines,
these viruses also cause almost continuous outbreaks of
FRI among recruits in military training throughout the
world [8,7,12,13].

Four of these seven adult human respiratory adenoviruses, HAdV-3, 7 and 21 (subspecies B1) and HAdV-4
(species E) are common, intraserotypically diverse, and
inevitably represented in broad surveys [7,8,10,14]. In
different populations and at different times one serotype
may completely dominate this niche, several serotypes
may intermingle, or multiple serotypes can appear in
series through distinct replacement events [13,15-19].
The remaining three serotypes that cause FRI in healthy
adults, HAdV-16 of subspecies B1 [11] and HAdV-11
and 14 of subspecies B2 [13], have only infrequently
been associated with FRI. These rare associations often
appear to involve more severe symptoms, outcomes, and
outbreak characteristics than do those of the more common species E and subspecies B1 serotypes [11,20-24].
HAdV-14 was reported only four times in the twentieth
century, always in transient, concentrated, and generally
nonlethal but severely incapacitating FRI outbreaks in
healthy (though crowded) adult and adolescent populations [25-28]. These outbreaks occurred between 1955
and 1963, all in Eurasia, and HAdV-14 was not reported
again even in broad geographical and temporal surveys
until 2001 when it was reported in 10% of FRI specimens in a retrospective analysis of clinic samples in Taiwan [29]. (Author’s note: upon whole-genome analysis,
this strain was identified as the very closely-related
HAdV-11a; HSH, AK, data not shown). HAdV-11a has
recently been seen in increased numbers of FRI cases in
Asia, including some significant outbreaks [30]. Phenotypic intermediates of the closely related serotypes
HAdV-11 and HAdV-14 were identified in a military
camp in Spain in 1969 [31], and in Germany from a
severe case of acute respiratory disease following a military training exercise (and apparently associated outbreak) in Turkey in 2004 [32].
HAdV-14 had never been identified in North America
before its emergence in 2006. Following the recognized
outbreaks in 2006 and 2007 [13,22,24], retrospective analysis of specific cases and collections uncovered isolated
occurrences of the disease dating back a few years before
the larger outbreaks (for example, see [23]). HAdV-14
was first seen in greater numbers and associated with significant outbreaks in March 2006, when it simultaneously
emerged at four military recruit training centers throughout the United States, causing several hundred cases
(estimated from partial surveillance) of FRI over the
course of the calendar year [13]. The impact amounted
to a partial replacement of the recently dominant HAdV4, rather than an increase in overall adenoviral impact at
these sites. These emergence events were not associated
with symptoms or epidemiological patterns outside the
normal range of those seen with the typical species E and
subspecies B1 HAdVs seen in surveillance of recruit FRI
and pneumonia [13].

Starting in March 2007, HAdV-14 was recognized as
the cause of several severe civilian outbreaks, prompting
attention from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [22]. The same pathogen was recognized
as the cause of prolonged outbreaks at three military
installations where HAdV-14 either emerged against an
adenovirus-free background ([22], and an outbreak at
Coast Guard Training Center, Cape May; unpublished
Naval Health Research Center [NHRC] data) or completely replaced the existing HAdV-4 strain (Marine Corps
Recruit Depot [MCRD], Parris Island, NJ; unpublished
NHRC data). Reported civilian HAdV-14 outbreaks were
transient, lasting four months and involving nine casualties [22]. The two noted outbreaks in recruit facilities
where there was no immediate history of ongoing adenovirus transmission were initially severe, involving
greatly increased rates of disease among the recruits and
also spreading to medical support personnel, training
staff, and others. One death was reported among
infected recruits as were many pneumonia hospitalizations, several requiring ventilation assistance [22].
Whole-genome restriction enzyme analysis (genome
typing [33]) and partial gene sequence analysis (hexon,
fiber, E1A) have shown that the currently emergent US
strains of HAdV-14 (see result section for the definition
of genome type HAdV-14p1), both civilian and military,
are all similar at the genome type level and essentially
identical (> 99.9%) at the sequence level in the hexon
and fiber genes (AK, unpublished data). The circulating
genome type, however, is significantly diverged from the
prototype (HAdV-14p) de Wit strain (isolated from ill
military recruits in the Netherlands [28]).
To further characterize the newly emergent US
HAdV-14 strains, three recent HAdV-14p1 isolates were
completely sequenced and compared with the prototype
HAdV-14p de Wit genome sequence as well as other
genetically related HAdV-11a isolates from southeast
Asia. One isolate was collected in March 2006 at Marine
Corps Recruit Depot, San Diego (MCRD-SD), when
HAdV-14 was initially detected and identified in US
recruits [13]. This isolate came from an emergence of
HAdV-14p1 that did not exhibit uniquely severe outbreak dynamics or symptoms - in fact, it was observed
during this outbreak, in which both HAdV-4 and
HAdV-14 were present in approximately equal proportions, that HAdV-14 did not seem to cause as much
pneumonia as did HAdV-4 (unpublished NHRC syndromic surveillance data). This outbreak did not involve
increased rates, but rather a simple and temporary
replacement of HAdV-4 with HAdV-14 [13], and the
studied isolate was collected from a recruit with uncomplicated FRI. The other two sequenced HAdV-14 isolates were collected at Lackland Air Force Base during
the severe and prolonged outbreak of HAdV-14 that

Houng et al. Respiratory Research 2010, 11:116
http://respiratory-research.com/content/11/1/116

started in February 2007 and drew the attention of the
CDC a month later, as the outbreak spread [22]. One
was from a fatal case of respiratory failure from viral
pneumonia, which followed several weeks of intubation
and life support. The other was from a mild case of FRI.
The primary goal of our study was to determine if
there were any apparent genetic correlates that might
distinguish viruses causing mild and severe outbreaks or
mild and severe symptoms, or differences between the
currently circulating strain of HAdV-14p1 and the prototype HAdV-14p that was seen in Eurasia in the 1950 s
and 1960 s. A secondary goal was to identify unique signature sequences that might allow us to track individual
strains of HAdV-14 of US origin for the purposes of
epidemiological investigations.

Materials and methods
Sample Collection

The isolate from a mild FRI outbreak at MCRD San
Diego was collected with consent under an institutional
review
board-approved
research
protocol
(NHRC.1999.0002), identified, cultured, and analyzed as
part of NHRC’s ongoing population-based FRI surveillance program. The two isolates from Lackland Air
Force Base included one NHRC surveillance isolate
from a recruit with uncomplicated FRI and one fatal
pneumonia isolate collected from a severely ill recruit at
Wilford Hall Medical Center, initially collected for diagnostic viral culture and later provided to LRRI and
WRAIR as a de-identified isolate.
NHRC samples were collected as oropharyngeal
(throat) swabs in VTM (Remel, Lenexa, KS), immediately frozen in either -80°C freezers or on dry ice, and
transported on dry ice to NHRC under College of
American Pathologists (CAP)-accredited collection and
transport protocols. Lackland Air Force Base samples
were collected as throat swabs in VTM, cultured in
A549 cells, and transported to NHRC as above. All samples were tested at NHRC for HAdV-14 [13] as raw specimens, then subsequently cultured in A549 cells
(Diagnostic Hybrids Inc., Athens, OH), and stored frozen as infected tissue culture fluid (isolated virus) at
Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute (LRRI). Sequencing work on these samples was performed at Walter
Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) on the
resulting isolates.
Sanger Sequencing of HAdV-14

PCR and sequencing were accomplished at the virology
facility at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research
(WRAIR), Silver Spring, Maryland, USA. PCR primer
pairs were designed from the prototype HAdV-14p de
Wit sequence (GenBank accession number AY803294)
and used to generate overlapping 1-2 kilobase amplicons

covering the entire genome. All PCR products were
sequenced in both directions by using forward and
reverse PCR primers corresponding to each individual
PCR product. All clean and verified readable sequences
were used to assemble full HAdV-14 genome sequences
using the Sequencher software (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI).
Two hundred microliter aliquots of each isolate were
extracted using the Invitrogen ChargeSwitch DNA
extraction kit (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA)
per the manufacturer’s instructions, and resuspended in
200 μl elution buffer. One hundred microliter PCR
amplification reactions consisted of 2 mM MgCl2,
0.6 mM dNTP (1.5 mM each A, C, T, and G), 200 μM
each primer, 2.5 units Platinum Taq Polymerase (Invitrogen), and 1 ul of extracted isolate in 1X ABI Buffer II
(Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA). Thermal
cycling was carried out on an ABI9700 platform
(Applied Biosystems) using the following parameters:
initial activation for 2 min at 94°C, then 35 cycles of:
20 s at 94°C, 20 s at 53°C, and 2 min at 72°C. Final
extension was for 7 min at 72°C. PCR cleanup was performed using the Qiagen PCR cleanup kit (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA) per the manufacturer’s instructions.
Sequencing reactions were set up per the manufacturer’s
instructions using the ABI BigDye Terminator kit (manual version 3.2, Applied Biosystems), and run on an
ABI9700 platform. Reaction products were analyzed on
an ABI3130XL automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems) per the manufacturer’s instructions. Resulting data
were then edited and aligned using Sequencher software
(Gene Codes).

Results and Discussions
HAdV-14 Genomes from 2006-7 US Outbreaks

Genomic sequences from three different recent US
HAdV-14 isolates, including two from Lackland Air
Force Base (303600 and 1986T, associated with mild
FRI and fatal pneumonia, respectively, both from a
severe outbreak) and one from Marine Corps Recruit
Depot, San Diego (NHRC22039, associated with a mild
infection during a mild outbreak) were fully sequenced,
assembled and submitted to the NCBI GenBank database (GenBank Accession #s FJ822614, EU827616 and
EU833993, respectively). The genome size of Lackland
strains 303600 and 1986T is identical to each other,
34,764 base pairs (bp) that is also identical in size with
the HAdV-14 prototype deWit strain, 34,764 base pairs
(bp). The San Diego strain NHRC22039 has a genome
size of 34,768 bp. All three recent US HAdV-14 strains
are highly homologous with each other. The two Lackland strains are 100% identical to each other, while the
San Diego isolate differed only by a 4 bp extension of
the polyadenylation signal (a poly-T on the coding

strand) at the 5’ end of the terminal binding protein
(TBP) gene, and a single noncoding (synonymous) base
substitution in the fiber gene. The poly-T repeat is
13 bp long [T(13)] in the Lackland strains and T(17) in
the San Diego strain. HAdV-14p strain deWit contains a
corresponding T(11) repeat. The genomes of all three
recent US HAdV-14 isolates share identical coding
regions for all genes. As recently described, and after
detailed characterization by restriction enzyme analysis,
all North American isolates of HAdV-14 correspond to
genome type 14p1 [34]. Table 1 shows the summary of
alignment results. HAdV-14 deWit and the recent US
HAdV-14p1 isolates differ by 0.3%, scattered quite
evenly through the genome. All 4 HAdV-14 s examined
in this study have the same base composition of 51.2%
A/T, 48.8% G/C. The GC content and the number of
open reading frames (ORFs) were identical to the
HAdV-14p de Wit strain. A map of the organization of
predicted ORFs within the genome of the emerging
HAdV-14p1 strain is shown in Figure 1, and is identical
to that of the prototype HAdV-14 de Wit strain.
All HAdV genomes are bounded by inverted terminal
repeats (ITR) ranging from 100 to 200 bp in size, which
serve as viral replication origins. The representative
ITRs of various HAdV species, such as species A

(HAdV-12, 18, 31), B (HAdV-3, 7, 11), and C (HAdV-1,
2, 5) are available in GenBank. Among these HAdVs,
ITRs are highly conserved within species but diverse
between species. For example, the ITRs of HAdV-2 and
HAdV-5 (species C) are identical 103 bp sequences.
Similarly conserved ITR patterns are observed for the
137 bp ITRs of species B (HAdV-3, 7 and 11). However,
all three recent US HAdV-14 s share identical inverted
terminal repeat (ITR) sequence of 133 bp, in contrast to
other species B HAdVs. The HAdV-14 prototype deWit
also contains a 133 bp ITR, but this differs from recent
HAdV-14 s of US origin by one substitution at base pair
68 (T68C). This level of polymorphism in ITR
sequences among closely related strains is unusual.
We compared HAdV-14p1 to selected HAdV-B prototype strains (HAdV-14, 3, 7, 11, and 21) using the
mVISTA Limited Area Global Alignment of Nucleotides
(LAGAN) tool (MontaVista Software, Inc., Santa Clara,
CA) [35] (Figure 2). With the exception of the hexon
gene of HAdV-11p, HAdV-14p1 showed strong homology with both HAdV-14p and -11p. This was expected,
since HAdV-11 and HAdV-14 are both members of
subspecies B2. Comparison of HAdV-14p1 to HAdV-3,
7, and 21, members of subspecies B1, revealed sequence
divergence throughout the genome, especially the penton, hexon, and fiber genes (Figure 2). These data are
consistent with serological identification of the new
strain as HAdV-14, since the hexon in the primary antigenic determinant and the penton and fiber act as secondary antigenic determinants.
The nucleotide identity scores for HAdV-14p1 genes
with less than 100% identity with HAdV-14p are shown
in Table 2. There were 19 nucleotide polymorphisms

observed. Only two of these affected amino acid coding
sequences. The first was a 3-bp insertion in the HAdV14p1 sequence, which resulted in an inserted serine at
position #147 of the 25.7 K and 28 K protein sequences
(Figure 3). The proteins encoded by E1A regulate the
transcription of viral as well as cellular genes [36,37].
The second was a 6-bp deletion in the fiber gene of the
HAdV-14p1 sequence. This resulted in a two amino

acid deletion in the FG loop of the fiber gene (Figure 4).
The fiber gene is responsible for mediating attachment
of the adenovirus to the host cell [38,39].

HAdV-14p de Wit and HAdV-14p1 strains were highly
homologous, we wanted to determine whether there was

HAdV-3, 4, 7, 11, 14, and 21 demonstrated that this
virus is mostly closely related to the HAdV-14p prototype strain and is not a recombinant with respect to
other recognized serotypic clades (data not shown). As
noted previously, polymorphisms between these two
strains were distributed evenly throughout the genome.
The three sequenced strains of HAdV-14p1 were
almost identical. The two Lackland isolates were exactly
the same, while the San Diego strain differed by the
addition of four extra Ts to the TBP polyadenylation
signal repeat, and by a single synonymous base substitution in the fiber gene.

Conclusions
HAdV-14p1 (strain 303600) appears to be a closely
related direct drift variant of the HAdV-14p (strain de
Wit) prototype seen in the past, differing primarily by

an insertion in E1A, a small deletion in the fiber gene,
and a few other coding single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) in E3 and other genes. The deletion (ΔK250E251) in the fiber gene is the most notable genetic difference between the HAdV-14p and HAdV-14p1 (Figure
4). Despite the observed ΔK250-E251 deletion, the fiber
gene sequence of HAdV-14p1 shares greater overall
homology with the fiber of HAdV-11a than that of
HAdV-11p. Whereas, HAdV-11p causes mostly urinary
tract infections and shares very low fiber homology with
HAdV-11p1, HAdV-11a and HAdV-14p all causing
respiratory infections [34]. This is consistent with the
receptor-binding role of the fiber and the close relationship between receptor specificity and organ tropism.
HAdV-14p1 and HAdV-11a both cause upper respiratory infections, while HAdV-11p causes mostly urinary
tract and bone marrow infections in transplant patients.
Species B viruses are unique in that they use CD46, a
complement protein, as a receptor [38]. Many other
human adenoviruses use the CAR protein [38]. The
deleted amino acids could affect the exposed region of
the FG loop by altering the overall affinity for CD46. A
less likely alternative is that the fiber deletion influences
an interaction with a receptor other than CD46, such as
CAR. A third possibility is that this deletion has no
affect at all on the fiber gene. Whether this mutation
affects the pathogenicity of HAdV-14p1 compared with
HAdV-14p will require further studies.
When HAdV-14p was first identified in Eurasia in the
1950 s and 1960 s, it generated localized, high attack
rate epidemics of FRI similar to those seen with the current strain. After a decade of sporadic activity, it disappeared and remained almost completely undetected for
4 decades. As a recently emerged virus, HAdV-14p1 has
an increased potential for high rates of transmission and
high attack rates, simply because the vast majority of
North Americans are likely to have never been exposed
(essentially the entire population is susceptible). This is
similar to the situation long recognized for HAdV-4,
which, in the absence of vaccines, has always been the

dominant serotype affecting military recruits. Serosurveys have generally indicated that a greater proportion
of the young adult population is susceptible to HAdV-4
than to other common respiratory serotypes such as
HAdV-7.
The two sequenced strains from Lackland Air Force
Base, one from a severe (fatal) pneumonia and one from
a mild case of acute respiratory disease, were identical.
There were only two noncoding polymorphisms distinguishing the Lackland isolates from the San Diego isolate
(another mild case). The poly-T length polymorphism
was studied in a wide range of isolates from multiple
sites, and found to be a hypervariable and useful source
of geographically specific strain identity information [40].
Neither mutation suggested a significant genetic source
of variation in clinical severity. The results supported
previous observations of a high degree of conservation in
hexon and fiber genes relative to the prototype HAdV14p and to the closely related HAdV-11a.
