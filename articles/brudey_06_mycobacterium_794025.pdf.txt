Abstract
Background: The Direct Repeat locus of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) is a member of
the CRISPR (Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) sequences family. Spoligotyping is
the widely used PCR-based reverse-hybridization blotting technique that assays the genetic diversity of this
locus and is useful both for clinical laboratory, molecular epidemiology, evolutionary and population
genetics. It is easy, robust, cheap, and produces highly diverse portable numerical results, as the result of
the combination of (1) Unique Events Polymorphism (UEP) (2) Insertion-Sequence-mediated genetic
recombination. Genetic convergence, although rare, was also previously demonstrated. Three previous
international spoligotype databases had partly revealed the global and local geographical structures of MTC
bacilli populations, however, there was a need for the release of a new, more representative and extended,
international spoligotyping database.
Results: The fourth international spoligotyping database, SpolDB4, describes 1939 shared-types (STs)
representative of a total of 39,295 strains from 122 countries, which are tentatively classified into 62
clades/lineages using a mixed expert-based and bioinformatical approach. The SpolDB4 update adds 26
new potentially phylogeographically-specific MTC genotype families. It provides a clearer picture of the
current MTC genomes diversity as well as on the relationships between the genetic attributes investigated
(spoligotypes) and the infra-species classification and evolutionary history of the species. Indeed, an
independent Naïve-Bayes mixture-model analysis has validated main of the previous supervised SpolDB3
classification results, confirming the usefulness of both supervised and unsupervised models as an approach
to understand MTC population structure. Updated results on the epidemiological status of spoligotypes,
as well as genetic prevalence maps on six main lineages are also shown. Our results suggests the existence
of fine geographical genetic clines within MTC populations, that could mirror the passed and present Homo
sapiens sapiens demographical and mycobacterial co-evolutionary history whose structure could be further
reconstructed and modelled, thereby providing a large-scale conceptual framework of the global TB
Epidemiologic Network.
Conclusion: Our results broaden the knowledge of the global phylogeography of the MTC complex.
SpolDB4 should be a very useful tool to better define the identity of a given MTC clinical isolate, and to
better analyze the links between its current spreading and previous evolutionary history. The building and
mining of extended MTC polymorphic genetic databases is in progress.

Background
Each year, 9 million new cases of tuberculosis (TB) are
recorded, of which 2 million result in fatality. Diagnostics,
chemotherapy and vaccination are available, however, the
disease is far from being eradicated [1]. Many genetic loci
within the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC)
genomes are polymorphic and may be used for molecular
evolutionary studies [2]. Among these, the Direct Repeat
locus (DR), which consists of alternating identical DRs
and variable spacers can be assessed using the "Spoligotyping" fingerprinting method thousands of different patterns [3]. DR loci are members of a universal family of
sequences, designated as CRISPR [4], whose physiological

role is poorly known [5,6]. Spoligotyping was previously
shown to be useful for both clinical management and
molecular epidemiology of MTC [7]. When used in association with variable-number of DNA tandem-repeat
(VNTR) [8] or Mycobacterial-interspersed-repetitive-units
(MIRU) [9], spoligotyping is a fast, robust, and cost effective genotyping technique, alternative to traditional
IS6110-RFLP fingerprinting. These methods are also designated as MLVA (Multiple-locus variable number tandem
repeats analysis) [10]. Since 1999, we have built and
released genetic diversity databases of the MTC DR locus
as an attempt to analyze MTC population structure, and to
assess the complexity of global TB transmission and of the

underlying spatial and temporal evolution of the TB
genetic landscape. Indeed, previous studies have shown
that the host's geographical origin is predictive of the clinical isolate of tuberculosis being carried, since there is an
apparent stable association of TB bacilli populations with
their human hosts in various environments [11], hence a
strong phylogeographical clustering of TB bacilli population. We hypothesize that co-evolution between human
beings and bacilli, and vertical transmission (in the
household), must have been the main mode of tuberculosis transmission throughout centuries and even millenniums [12].
MTC organisms were also shown to evolve clonally [13].
Hence, the reconstruction of the population structure of
this species may be an indirect way of assessing its main
host's (Homo sapiens sapiens) migratory and demographic
history [14]. Indeed, tuberculosis may have affected early
hominids and it is tempting to speculate that the MTC
originated in East-Africa [15]. Its expansion to the rest of
the world may have coincided with the waves of human
migration out of Africa, with potential back migration
from Asia to Sub-Saharan Africa [16]. If the past phylogeny of MTC is likely to have involved horizontal gene
transfer events, however, these events are no longer
observed [17]. All these clues suggests the pioneer roles of
geography, demography and human migration history in
shaping today's MTC population structure [11]. Consequently, the current concepts of "natural evolving communities" or "clusters of bacilli", are important: (1) for TB
epidemiology – as the global pandemia should be considered as a network of outbreaks of more or less circumscribed clones [18,19] – (2) for molecular ecology,
evolutionary and population genetics and phylogeography, – as today's MTC genomes are likely to include cryptic information on their passed and present history in
their changing environments [20,21] – and last but not
least (3) for systematics and infra-species taxonomy [22].
The two first databases were poorly representative of the
worldwide MTC diversity [23,24], whereas the third
update was already more representative [25,26]. Although
these studies did not allow for a definitive rebuilding of
the MTC limb and twig history of the TB tree, their use
combined to bioinformatical data-mining methods,
allowed to previously classify MTC in eight to ten main
genetic lineages [27], a classification that has now been
validated using SNPs [28,29].
In this new study, we data-mined an updated SpolDB4
version, which contains 1939 STs representing a total of
39,295 clinical isolates originating from 122 countries.
Considering the known diversity of the origin of patients,
which was documented in some cases, SpolDB4 is representative of a total of 141 countries. The SpolDB4 update
adds 1126 newly defined STs and provides a higher reso-

lution picture of the worldwide MTC genome diversity
assessed by spoligotyping. However, the new challenge is
to link the genetic variability of MTC with the clinical variability of TB, whatever the setting, whether in high burden countries or in densely populated areas such as India
or China.

Results
Classification of spoligotypes
Classification of SpolDB4 spoligotype patterns into meaningful
lineages
The listing of ST alleles with their distribution by country
of location and a presumed sub lineage/lineage label is
provided in additional file 1. 51 new countries are represented in SpolDB4. Out of 39,295 spoligotypes patterns,
n = 35,925 are found in 1939 STs (91.4% of the isolates,)
and 3370 (8.6%) are orphan patterns, totalling 5,309
individual alleles. Two approaches, a statistical, and a
mixed expert-based/bioinformatical one were used to
data-mine SpolDB4 to classify spoligotypes. Results are
summarized in Figure 1.
Results obtained by the statistical approach
The 20 most frequent STs totalled 17,701 isolates (49.3%
of the clustered isolates). The 50 most frequent STs
increased clustering to 61.8% (n = 22,219). These 50 most
frequent types are shown in figure 1. Three types did not
receive a lineage label, ST46, ST51 and ST210. ST46 and
ST51 are patterns prone to genetic convergence, similarly
as reported for ST4, whose ancestors can either be ST33 or
ST34 [30]. ST210 (also designated as HN24, a Principal
Genetic Group (PGG) 3 strain) was first described in a
study done in Texas and is almost restricted to the USA
[31]. The other 47 most prevalent spoligotypes belong to
known genetic lineages or are defined variants.
Results obtained by the mixed expert-based/bioinformatical
approach
Figure 1 also describes a total of 62 remarkable lineages/
sub lineages. This classification was obtained with the use
of a dedicated software that search for similarities between
patterns (SpolNet, P. Abdoul et al. unpublished, see material and methods section). Since SpolDB4 is a mixed M.
tuberculosis (human) and M. bovis (human or bovine) isolates database, 237 STs were found to belong to the M.
bovis subspecies (n = 5710), whereas 1702 STs (n =
33,585) were not M. bovis. The calculation of the genetic
diversity index "H" -defined as H = 2n (1 - Σxi2)/2n-1
where n = number of individuals and xi is the frequency of
the ith allele-gives a value of 0,98. H only slightly
improved (+0.6%) compared to SpolDB3. This shows that
the exponential increase of data was not reflected by the
increase in bacterial diversity description, as most data
were already known (over fitting phenomenon, a limitation of this study). Indeed, a quantitatively updated

SpolDB3 (on 817 STs) would cluster 31,292 isolates,
whereas the new 1122 STs aggregate only 4633 additional
clustered isolates. Further improvement of H would
require new data entries, possibly from yet unrepresented
settings and/or high TB-burden countries such as India
and China.
New genetic lineages within M. tuberculosis complex
SpolDB4 defines 62 genetic lineages/sub lineages (figure
1). M. bovis strains were divided in 3 sub lineages corresponding to ST prototypes 482, 683 and 479. A new signature for M. microti is suggested (presence of spacers
sp37-38, ST539) [32], instead of ST641 in SpolDB3. M.
caprae and 2 sub lineages of M. pinipedii, a new member of
MTC [33], were added. Within the M. africanum subspecies, more is known today on its taxonomical status,
thanks to improvement of spoligotyping through the 68
spacers format and thanks to the discovery of other lineage-specific genetic markers [34,35]. Using a dedicated
software (structure version 2, [36,37]) to infer the population structure of the M. africanum spoligotyping dataset of
SpolDB4, one would suggest the existence of at least 4
populations in SpolDB4 (results not shown), however
more data on the genetic diversity of M. africanum will be
required to be able to get a clearer picture of the global
population structure of this pathogen.
New genetic lineages within M. tuberculosis stricto sensu
Among M. tuberculosis stricto sensu, new visual rules
defining 22 lineages/sub lineages are described. The previously defined Central-Asian (CAS) lineage was split into
CAS1-Delhi type (ST26) found mainly in India and in the
Indian subcontinent [38,39], and CAS1-Kilimanjaro
(ST21) found in Tanzania [40]. Within the East-AfricanIndian (EAI) lineage, new prototypic spoligotyping-signatures for 4 sub lineages are presented (EAI2-Nonthaburi,
EAI6-Bangladesh/1, EAI7-Bangladesh/2 and EAI8-Madagascar). Douglas et al. designated the EAI2 clade as the
"Manila family" [41]. We further linked the Nonthaburi
group of strains from Thailand [42] to this lineage (results
not shown). EAI3 and EAI4, are now being shown as phylogeographically specific from India and Vietnam respectively, with suggested designations of EAI3-IND and EAI4VNM. Two new lineages from Bangladesh are found, designated as EAI6-Bangladesh/1 (58.1% of isolates from
Bangladesh) and EAI7-Bangladesh/2 (91.2% of isolates
from Bangladesh). EAI6-BGD1 harbours specificity for the
eastern part of the South Asian region since it is also found
in neighbouring Myanmar (results not shown).

Within the Haarlem (H) lineage, a 4th sub lineage (H4) is
tentatively added. It is characterized by the absence of
spacers 29–31 and 33–36 (prototypes ST127 and/or
ST777). More than 60% of ST127 isolates are localized in
Armenia, Austria, Finland, Georgia, Iran, and Russia. A

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/6/23

likely related pattern (ST777) is found in Saudi Arabia. An
hypothesis is that these strains could represent an intermediate genetic link between the previously defined Haarlem-1 (H1, ST 47) and Haarlem-3 (H3, ST50) genotypes.
Type ST777, which shows a single spacer difference from
ST 127, is also found in Kazakhstan, Russia, and Georgia
(n = 26). These isolates are likely to be identical to the
recently described "Ural" family of strains [43]. They suggest the prominent role of Central Asia as a hub of migratory routes of Homo sapiens sapiens and its role in the
history of infectious diseases.
Within the Latin-American-Mediterranean (LAM) lineage,
we rebaptised the LAM7 sub lineage as LAM7-Turkey since
recent results suggested that ST41 is predominant in Asia
Minor [44]. Similarly, the LAM10 sub lineage was
renamed as LAM10-Cameroun [45,46]. Two sub lineages
are new, LAM11-ZWE (ST 59) with 57.8% of isolates originating from Zimbabwe [47], and LAM12-Madrid1
(ST209) [48]. The LAM11-ZWE is likely to be identical to
the recently described Meru family found in Tanzania
[40]. The "Manu" family, a new family from India, which
could be an ancestral clone of principal genetic group 1
strains [39], is tentatively sub-divided into Manu1 (deletion of spacer 34), Manu2 (deletion of spacers 33–34),
and Manu3 (deletion of spacers 34–36). The central role
of India, and more generally of Asia in tuberculosis evolutionary history is more and more evident. The S lineage
which is highly prevalent in Sicily and Sardinia, could be
identical to the F28 clade in South Africa [30,49]; the
existence of this genotype family was confirmed in
SpolDB4, however its origin remains unknown. The "T"
families (modern TB strains) stayed ill-defined with more
than 600 unclassified STs. They were stratified into 5 subclades (T1-T5) based on single-spacer differences. 8 nested
clades, with robust spoligotyping-signatures were
extracted; with the exception of "Tuscany", their names
were built using their proximate upper-clade designation
(T1 to T5), followed by their presumed geographical specificity: T3-Ethiopia (ST149); T5-Russia/1 (ST254), T1Russia/2 (ST280), T3-Osaka (ST627), T5-Madrid/2
(ST58), T4-Central Europe/1 (ST39), T2-Uganda (ST135),
and "Tuscany" (ST1737). ST149 was previously shown to
be frequent in Ethiopia and in Denmark among Ethiopian
immigrants. This low-banding IS6110 clone had been
identified based on IS6110-RFLP as early as 1995 and represented 36.2% of isolates from this country [50]. ST254
and ST280 were repeatedly isolated from clinical isolates
in Russia, in former Russian soviet republics and in Northern and Eastern European countries (Estonia, Finland,
Georgia, Latvia, Poland, Russia). ST1737, with a single
spacer difference from ST254, was recently found in Italy
and designated as "Tuscany" [51]. ST627 was identified
for the first time in Finland and repeatedly found in the
Okayama district and elsewhere in Japan [52]. T5-Madrid/

2 isolates were previously found to be characteristic of
Spanish-related settings [48]. T2-Uganda, which was first
described by Niemann et al., was repeatedly found in East
Africa, and at least 7 STs with a prototypic signature are
linked to East-Africa. Last but not least, the T4-CE1 (for
Central-Europe/1) was tentatively identified based on
similarity between ST39 found in Europe and South
Africa, and some likely derived genotypes found both in
South and North America (ST94, ST430, ST1258). Among
those, ST1258 represents the most prevalent spoligotype
detected by the Inuit's community in Nunavik, Canada.
Whether this type has been introduced by a casual European contact into this community, or has been endemic
among the Inuits is currently under investigation [53].
The X genotype family (X1-X3 sub lineages) was initially
described thanks to data-mining [27]. This family is today
a well-characterized IS6110 low-banding family, duly
characterized by IS6110-RFLP as well as by high-throughput genetic methods [54-57]; it is prevalent in UK, in USA
and in former British colonies. Lastly, a Vietnamese genotype family characterized by the absence of IS6110 insertion elements, was shown to bear a specific spoligotyping
signature which is characterized by the deletion of spacers
19–41 (ST 405), and was designated as the "Zero copy"
clade [58].

total) remained unclassified. These STs harboured patterns with either important blocks of deletion, disseminated deletions, mixed signatures, or patterns, which at
this time did not correspond to any known spoligotypesignatures.

Results
Population genetics
The worldwide distribution of data points was assessed
within eight regions. Isolates from Europe and North
America represented 65.5% of all entries. Africa, Far-East
Asia, Middle East and Central Asia, and South America
were equally represented (6.5% to 8.3% of entries)
whereas Central America and Oceania were underrepresented (3.6% and 1.1% of entries). The overrepresentation of M. bovis from Europe and South America (about 30
and 25% respectively) limits the interpretation on global
M. bovis genetic diversity, but also reflects the reality of the
importance of beef cattle economy in South America (Brazil and Argentina) and Europe. Orphan spoligotypes, represented 35.7% and 16.9% of the isolates in Europe and
North America respectively, and ranged from 1.2% to
11.5% in the other regions.

Comparison between the supervised and an unsupervised Naïve
Bayes statistical approach of classification of spoligotypes
Data-mining and clustering techniques are the focus of
intense research in Information and Bio Sciences [59].
Classification of spoligotypes, given the almost infinite
dimension of theoretical allelic number -n = 243 in the current format that does not detect the complete set of
known spacers-, is not a trivial task. A recent attempt to
use a statistical approach of classification of spoligotypes
through the utilization of a Naïve Bayes algorithm and a
mixture model was suggested [60]. A good correlation was
found between the two techniques for a large number of
genotype families defined, with strong support of the stability value. However, the mixture model also suggested
the existence of new spoligotype signatures and a total of
48 families (N1 to N48) [60]. Some of these signatures are
confirmed by this study, others are not. A similar
approach using a Markov model is currently under development in our laboratory.

Figure 2 is a synthetic histogram of the distribution of 10
main lineages in the studied continents. In brief, Beijing
and Beijing-like strains represent about 50% of the strains
in Far East-Asia and 13% of isolates globally. In Europe,
the Haarlem lineage represents about 25% of the isolates.
In South America, about 50% of the strains belong to the
LAM family. Three major genotypic families (Haarlem,
LAM, and T) are the most frequent in Africa, Central
America, Europe and South America. Outside Europe, The
Haarlem strains were mainly found in Central America
and Caribbean (about 25%), suggesting a link of Haarlem
to the post-Columbus European colonization [61] (Figure
3). The presence of the LAM family is highest in Venezuela
(65%) [62], in the Mediterranean basin (e.g. 34% in Algeria, 55% in Morocco, 30% in Spain), and in the Caribbean
region (30% in Cuba and Haiti, 17.4% in French Guiana,
15% in French Caribbean islands) (Figure 3A). The "illdefined" T genetic family, was found in all continents, and
corresponded to about 30% of all entries in the database.
Undoubtedly, MLVA and/or SNPs data will improve the
knowledge of the identity of these isolates designated as
"T" by default [26].

Unclassified spoligotypes
454 STs (23.4%) did not correspond to any pattern recognition rule when data were mined automatically using
SpolNet. Nonetheless, we attributed a family label to
these spoligotypes too by extending the rules defined initially, and subsequently by a visual assessment on each
unclassified ST. Thus, 314 more STs were tentatively classified with a family label, and only 131 STs (7% of the

The Beijing family of strains is prevalent in Far-East-Asia,
but also in Middle-East-Central Asia and Oceania (45.9%,
16.5% and 17.2% respectively) (Figure 3). The Beijing
genotype which may have been endemic in China for a
long time [63] is emerging in some parts of the world,
especially in countries of the former Soviet Union, and to
a lesser extent in the Western world [64]. The East-AfricanIndian (EAI) family is also highly prevalent in these areas

(33.8% in Far-East-Asia, 24.3% in the Middle East and
Central Asia, and 22.9% in Oceania). The EAI lineage is
more prevalent in South-East Asia, particularly in the Philippines (73%; [41]), in Myanmar and Malaysia (53% ;
[65]), in Vietnam and Thailand (32% ; [62]) (Figure 3).
The CAS1-Delhi family is essentially localized in the Middle-East and Central Asia, more specifically in South-Asia,
(21.2%), and preferentially in India (75%; [38,66]). It is
also found in other countries of this region such as Iran,
and Pakistan [67,68]. It has also been found in several
others regions (Africa, 5.3%; Central America, 0.1%;
Europe, 3.3%; Far-East-Asia, 0.4%; North-America, 3.3%;
Oceania, 4.8%). In Europe and Australia, these strains
were frequently found to be linked with immigrants from
South Asia [24].
Lastly, the X family is highly prevalent in North America
(21.5%) and Central American (11.9%) regions. It could
be linked to an Anglo-Saxon ancestry, as it has been
encountered in English-colonized areas such as in the

United Kingdom, United States, Australia, South Africa
and in the Caribbean [27]. However, according to other
investigators, this group of strains is currently correlated
with African-Americans, a fact however that may not represent the ancestry of this genotype [69]. More studies
should be done to clarify this issue.
Analysis of the spreading and epidemiological status of MTC clones
We further analyzed the epidemic status of each spoligotyping-defined clone as shown by the index C1 and C2
[26] as well as the inter-continental match between STs.
Results are shown in Table 1 and Table 2. Briefly, the
Spreading Index (SI) represents a mean number of occurrences of a clone, independent of the setting. Fourteen
types were defined as "epidemic" (SI>25), 65 as "common"(10<SI<25), 669 as "recurrent" (SI<10) and 1090 as
"rare" (SI ≤ 2). The Table 1 shows the results based on
combination of C1 and C2 which provides 12 classes
ranging from the highly localized (endemic) and numerous (epidemic), to the highly spread (ubiquitous) and
infrequent (rare) genotypes. When analyzed geographi-

cally using the Matching Code (MC), a total of 824 types
are found within a single macro region ("Endemic",
42,5%), and 564 types are present in exactly two settings
("localized", 29%). Types present in three macro regions
but found in five or less areas are also defined as localized
and totalled 246 types. The Intercontinental match of
these types was not analyzed further. All other types, being
present in at least three continents and in at least six areas,
or present in four or more continents, (n = 551), were
declared as "ubiquitous". The Table 2 shows the number
of endemic types per continent and presents the matching
results between "localized" types. Endemic types are likely
to represent local clones, current end points of evolution,
either because of extinction (for ancient clones) or
because epidemiological transmission was not yet followed by mutation for emerging ones. Independently of
recruitment, the number of endemic types is minimal in
Oceania and Central America (0.005 endemic type/occurrence), two regions that have experienced a negative
migratory balance for centuries. In all other continents,
with a 0.015 to 0.03 endemic type/occurrence, and
slightly more in Middle-East and Central Asia (0.037),
rates of endemism appear to be similar, a feature resulting
from a combination of the intrinsic molecular clock of the
DR locus, the age of the tubercle bacilli, and the historical
tuberculosis transmission waves.

Toward an interactive system of geographic atlas of genotype
frequency data of Mycobacterium tuberculosis
Figure 3 and 4 illustrate a mixed representation (by absolute case number and by frequency) of the distribution of
the most frequent STs shown in Figure 1, and grouped by
genetic lineage, for the following six MTC lineages: Beijing, M. bovis, Central-Asia, East-African-Indian, Haarlem
and Latin-American-Mediterranean. These Figures provides the best display of the global phylogeographical
structure of the MTC population. Similar results focused
in Europe (data not shown) and using SpolDB4 suggests
the existence of fine geographic genetic clines between
four prevalent genotypes belonging to the modern MTC
types, i.e. ST53-T1, ST50-Haarlem3, ST47-Haarlem1,
ST42-LAM9 [70].

Discussion
In this study, we data-mined an updated international
spoligotype database of the M. tuberculosis complex,
SpolDB4, both for improving classification of MTC
genomes, and for presenting a more reliable snapshot picture of the global and local population genetics of tubercle bacilli. Considering the known diversity of the origin
of patients, SpolDB4 represents clinical isolates from a
total of 141 countries. This is to our knowledge the largest
collaborative effort to describe the worldwide genetic
structure of MTC.

The scaling-up that represents SpolDB4 relatively to
SpolDB3 (4×), allowed new sub lineages to be discovered.
However, it also showed the limit of the approach of
using spoligotyping only to define the precise identity of
a given MTC clone, since over fitting was observed. Combined DR, MLVA, SNPs, Region of Differences polymorphic datasets are now required to improve our knowledge
of MTC genomes diversity.
Today's observed pattern of phylogeographical diversity
of MTC is undoubtedly the result of both a deep ecological differentiation and of a more recent demographic and
epidemic history. It is tempting to speculate, especially
since the publication of the recent studies done on M. canettii [15,71], that TB is as old as humanity. It is also tempting to hypothesize that the EAI ancestral strains spread
back from Asia to Africa through India concomitantly to
human migrations [72], and that evolution gave rise to
the CAS lineage, and possibly to all "modern" TB lineages.
Recently, Mokrousov et al. used the Beijing lineage as a
model to compare its phylogeography with human
demography and Y chromosome-based phylogeography
[73]. Further work using other genetic markers will help to
better define the retrospective demographical history of
the various sub lineages described here.
Such an endeavour as the building of SpolDB4, and more
generally the building of a representative genetic diversity
database, should however assume limitations concerning
both the quality and representativity of data. We partially
eliminated the first problems by carefully double checking many datasets visually, reinterpreting other datasets
by asking for the autoradiography results sent as electronic files, or by simply excluding datasets harbouring
systematic genotyping errors. The procedure of examining

only STs improves data quality by minimizing artefacts
analysis. Some internationally agreed upon recommendations to improve the quality of spoligotyping are also in
progress and will be published elsewhere. The second
problem (representativity) is more chronic and difficult to
solve. More financial means should be devoted to improving both mycobacteriology diagnostic and genotyping
facilities in countries where the outbreaks prevail. Another
limitation using spoligotyping is the study of mixed populations of bacilli [74]. Indeed, MLVA is appropriate, contrary to spoligotyping, to reveal the existence of dual
infections, an issue which, especially in high prevalence
countries, was probably underestimated and that may
sometimes jeopardize spoligotyping results. Future studies should attempt to evaluate whether admixture models
can in fact explain some yet undefined mixed spoligotyping signatures.
One of the major lessons from this collaborative effort is
that new markers such as MLVA, SNPs or others are
needed to improve our knowledge on the population
structure of MTC. MLVA provides an improved knowledge
of MTC clonal complexes, a strategy for the MTC which
could even be more effective than the Multi-LocusSequence-Typing (MLST) approach [55,75]. MLVA allows
the investigator to limit the quantity of required genotyping to only type epidemiologically or phylogenetically
informative markers, depending on the branch depth
(regarding time) to which a given data set should to be
analyzed [76]. Rapid changes in MTC genotyping methodologies have lead to numerous ongoing debates about
the choice of the best genotyping strategy [77-79].
Our efforts to characterize the classification of the tuberculosis strains present within populations have also led to

an increased understanding of their global distribution.
Our results do not fully agree with recently published
results [11] suggesting that M. tuberculosis did not possess
a finer geographic structure than the one defined within
broad regions (East Asia, Africa, Europe, Philippines and
Americas). On the contrary, our results demonstrate that
the genetic diversity of M. tuberculosis genomes and hence
their population structure, is strongly linked to geography
at a fine geographical scale, thus reinforcing the importance of localized effort to control tuberculosis and to
consider the global tuberculosis pandemia as the sum of
very different and genetically separate individual outbreaks. Future work should focus on an adequate modelization of the database according to demography and
tuberculosis prevalence, to present a more realistic quantitative TB genetic landscape.
Linking these results for a clinical benefit for individual
patients remains another challenge. In particular, we need
to better understand why in certain areas a small number
of strains are causing a disproportionate number of cases
of the disease and we need to better understand the effects
of host's genetic and environmental variability on the
presentation of the disease [80]. In the Western world TB
occurs mainly due to reactivation of disease in the older
age class and immigration in younger ones. Consequently
the characteristics of the bacterial population are those of
an old outbreak under extinction, with the superimposition of new characteristics due to cases of importation and
recent transmission. The more homogeneous population
structure in high-burden countries is more likely to reflect
the ongoing transmission in all age classes. Selection of
particular genotypes (e.g. due to vaccination with M. bovis
BCG) and clonal selection [81] has also been suggested
[50,82]. Previous colonization histories, and of course
more deeply rooted anthropological structures as well as
geographic isolation, may have also contributed to the
complex tuberculosis genetic landscape.

Conclusion
The SpolDB4 database is by far one of the largest publicly
available database on M. tuberculosis complex genetic polymorphism with a universal nomenclature system of spoligotyping (octal or arbitrary ST number) as well as a
global epidemiological information system. Our results
suggest the existence of fine geographical genetic clines
that may correlate to the passed Homo sapiens sapiens
demographical history. Further combined (multimarkers)
genetic databases, as well as local finer scale analysis are in
progress to further analyze the complexity of the evolutionary history of the MTC.

Methods
Database
A total of 39,295 entries were collected in an Access® database. The Previous STs numbered 1 to 817 were previously
described in SpolDB3. ST633, 714, 729, 770, 797, which
were missing in the former version were replaced by new
genotypes. SpolDB4 is available [see additional file 1] and
can also be downloaded (sorted/unsorted versions) at:
[83]. A dedicated interactive website version is available
[93].

The distribution by continent and country of isolation is
shown below. Macro region name, defining acronym,
identification number and total number of patterns (into
brackets) are respectively: Africa AFR -1 (n = 3121), Central-America CAM -2 (n = 1353), Europe EUR -3 (n =
13624), Far-East Asia FEA -4 (n = 2624), Middle East and
Central Asia MECA -5 (n = 2639), North-America NAM -6
(n = 9153), Oceania OCE -7 (n = 235), South-America
SAM -8 (n = 3176).
Origin of spoligotypes
The spoligotypes were either obtained at the Pasteur Institute of Guadeloupe using the 43-spacers format and
home-made membranes [84,85], received from co-investigators and collaborating laboratories, or retrieved from
local molecular epidemiological studies or diversitydriven published articles. The sampling is still far from
being representative for all countries, and in many cases,
limited epidemiological and patient information on the
isolates were available. However, we assume that this "
convenience sample " is representative of world-wide TB
genotypes and that, with spoligotypes from almost
40.000 M. tuberculosis isolates, this 4th version allows for
new and robust inferences in phylogeography, population
genetics, and global epidemiology of M. tuberculosis to be
drawn.
Description

Data format
All spoligotypes were converted into the octal format
within Excel spreadsheets [86]. The database is main-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/6/23

tained under an Access® format, whereas a Bionumerics®
version is also regularly updated (Applied Maths, SintMarteen-Latem, Belgium). An updated mySQL-Java-based
version is in development. The Information system automatically attributes the shared-type (ST) number to all the
entries that correspond to an identical spoligotype found
in two or more individual patient isolates, whereas, the
entries occurring only once are considered as orphan.
Combined automatized-expert based classification of
spoligotypes
To be classified by SpolNet, spoligotypes must be
expressed under the form of binary vectors of 43 bits.
Using clade and Principal Genetic Groups (PGG) clustering [87], which was previously established or collected by
our laboratory and others [88], computerized rules have
been generated to sort spoligotypes into clades. Each computerized rule is a translation of a global visual recognition rule. This rule may be defined using a combination of
four criteria: (a) presence of a block of one or many consecutive bits (b) absence of a block of one or many consecutive bits (c) presence of at least one bit in a given bit
interval (d) absence of at least one bit in a given bit interval. The computer science translation of these four criteria
required the creation of a positive and a negative rule. The
positive rule translates the fact that a bit is absent or
present in the vector. The negative rule translates the fact
that there must be at least one bit present or absent in a
given interval. Three values can be attributed for each bit,
"n" = present, "o" = absent, "x" = variable. The software
generates a text file, which contains all spoligotypes sorted
by family and PGG, and a specific file for each rule containing the spoligotypes which fulfilled the selection criteria. Rules are hierarchical, i.e. some rules are smooth and
almost each spoligotype fulfils it (ex: T1 rule), whereas
others are tight (ex: LAM12-Madrid1), hence a final multilevel classification scheme for each shared-type from the
most precise to the less precise sub lineage/lineage label
(ex: LAM3/LAM9/T1).

Secondly, an algorithm establishes the hierarchic links
from the entry data file. This algorithm is based on a comparison of vector. The model (assumption) relies on an
evolution that proceeds by deletion of a unique block of
one to n consecutive bits on the DR locus. For a given spoligotype, the algorithm finds all the potential offspring
spoligotypes. The result is transferred into a file whose format is directly used by the BioLayout software [89]. Building a file for BioLayout looks like a simple task but it turns
out to be a tedious and time-consuming task for file with
hundreds of spoligotypes. This file cannot be built without software for thousands of spoligotypes, as it is the case
for the SpolDB4 database project. The two developed
algorithms are exponential, i.e. the time to sort data files
and to generate Biolayout files increases with the size of

Page 13 of 17
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Microbiology 2006, 6:23

the entry data file. As an example, a file with 1000 spoligotypes may take approximately 20 minutes to be sorted
and 20 minutes to generate the Biolayout file. New spoligotype-recognition rules may be introduced as a dynamic
process, either when new genotypes are discovered, to
introduce new hypothesis, or to modify pre-existing rules.
Definition of indices
The global distribution of spoligotyping patterns was
assessed within and between the eight studied continental
regions: Africa, Central America, Europe, Far East Asia,
Middle East and Central Asia, North America, Oceania,
and South America. A slight modification in definition of
C1 and C2 was introduced, i.e. a spreading Index SI ≥ 25
instead of SI ≥ 30 is now required to define a clone as "epidemic". Briefly, the Spreading Index (SI) represents a
mean number of occurences of a clone, independent of
the setting (total n° of occurrences for this ST divided by
the number of geographical areas where it is found). The
reader should refer to Figure 2 of [26], or to Table 1 for full
definition of C1 and C2.
Availability
SpolDB4 listing [see additional file 1] is available as supplemental material. A dedicated interactive website,
SITVIT1 which will allow SpolDB4 (39525 genotypes) to
be queried online is available [93]. In its research format
SITVIT1 allows one to enter MLVA data and to automatically detect MLVA clusters [90]. The full list of investigators having contributed to SpolDBs since the origin of the
project will also appear on the website. SpotClust results
were extracted from [91].
Quality control (QC)
During the SpolDB4 project, we faced increased quality
control problems due to an increased recruitment rate and
had to exclude some datasets. A common problem was
the systematic absence of one spacer on some membranes. These data sets were systematically excluded. Most
of these problems were linked to manufacturing defaults
in the commercialized membranes. All data sets were
checked individually and sometimes audited on source
results (autoradiography). Most investigators, to check
their procedures, completed a QC form. International
Guidelines to increase spoligotyping quality are in
progress and will be reported elsewhere. As in all databases, we assume a reasonable (2 to 5% maximum) error
rate in data points. However, the problem of QC in high
throughput genotyping technique and database science
technology is an emerging issue [92]. A list of STs whose
distribution did not change between SpolDB3 and 4 is
available upon request. These genotypes represent: (1)
ongoing genotypes not detected because of no follow-up
in a given area, (2) potentially extinct genotypes, (3)
potential typing artefacts. Similarly as in SpolDB3, where

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/6/23

5 STs had been suppressed, 22 STs in SpolDB4 could be
artefacts (ST422, 424, 425, 454, 456, 540, 547, 551, 553,
556, 571, 870, 886, 887, 900, 901, 908, 1270, 1575,
1608, 1625, 1896).

Authors' contributions
All authors contributed to the spoligotyping data contained in the database at various levels, by locally isolating, identifying clinical isolates, preparing DNA and
genotyping clinically isolates of MTC and sending their
results to the Pasteur Institute in Guadeloupe. Their relative contribution would be to tedious to mention here,
however, they are all part of the paper because such population-based studies could not be done without adequate mycobacteriological diagnostics, i.e., isolation of
clinical isolates, identification, drug-susceptibility testing,
DNA extraction, genotyping and ultimately by sharing of
data, hence without adequate reward of the numerous
persons and labs involved in such analysis.
KB managed the SpolDB4 Information System, controlled
data quality, did part of the supervised analysis, used
SpolNet for Bioinformatical classification, compiled data
synthesis. CS initiated the SpolDB project, established
many of the contacts, recruited many of the investigators
with NR, writing e-mails, checked the Information System
developments helped by numerous Computer scientists
(Philippe Leremon, Christel Delfino, Philippe Abdoul,
Georges Valétudie, are warmly acknowledged). CS did
part of the mining with KB and wrote the paper. JRD managed the PHRI New-York database and sent his data regularly to CS and KB. LR and WP were the two most "big
account" data providers, together with AG. BL produced
the maps (P. Waniez, Philcarto®, IRD, France) and contributed to the statistical analysis.

Additional material
Additional file 1
Supplemental Table: SpolDB4 listing of all STs, binary description, octal
description, distribution per country of isolation and/or of origin when
available, clade/subclade label. Country names were chosen according to
the ISO3166-three-letter format. "U" = unknown. Clade/subclade label
using spoligotyping only should be taken as presumptive or indicative of a
likely clade/subclade belonging but may in some case be misleading and
requires in most cases further investigations to confirm the identity of a
given isolate. In some instances, mixed patterns (unrecognized) did not
unambiguously allow spoligotyping classification, hence an ambiguous
final label in this table.
