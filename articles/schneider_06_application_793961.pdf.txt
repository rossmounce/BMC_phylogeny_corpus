Abstract
Background: Manually finding subtle yet statistically significant links to distantly related
homologues becomes practically impossible for very populated protein families due to the sheer
number of similarity searches to be invoked and analyzed. The unclear evolutionary relationship
between classical mammalian lipases and the recently discovered human adipose triglyceride lipase
(ATGL; a patatin family member) is an exemplary case for such a problem.
Results: We describe an unsupervised, sensitive sequence segment collection heuristic suitable for
assembling very large protein families. It is based on fan-like expanding, iterative database searches.
To prevent inclusion of unrelated hits, additional criteria are introduced: minimal alignment length
and overlap with starting sequence segments, finding starting sequences in reciprocal searches,
automated filtering for compositional bias and repetitive patterns. This heuristic was implemented
as FAMILYSEARCHER in the ANNIE sequence analysis environment and applied to search for
protein links between the classical lipase family and the patatin-like group.
Conclusion: The FAMILYSEARCHER is an efficient tool for tracing distant evolutionary
relationships involving large protein families. Although classical lipases and ATGL have no obvious
sequence similarity and differ with regard to fold and catalytic mechanism, homology links detected
with FAMILYSEARCHER show that they are evolutionarily related. The conserved sequence parts
can be narrowed down to an ancestral core module consisting of three β-strands, one α-helix and
a turn containing the typical nucleophilic serine. Moreover, this ancestral module also appears in
numerous enzymes with various substrate specificities, but that critically rely on nucleophilic attack
mechanisms.

Background
The failure to develop a rational, generally applicable cure
for obesity-related diseases can be attributed to the highly
complex regulation of energy metabolism, which is not
yet fully understood. On the other hand considering the
historic successes in deciphering the underlying biochemical pathways, it is assumed that the chemical transformation steps of basic metabolites are known in their entirety.
This view is seriously questioned in light of the recent discovery of ATGL, a protein that catalyzes the initial step of
hydrolysis of triacylglycerides at the surface of lipid droplets in adipocytes [1]. It is surprising that the fundamental
activity of this key enzyme escaped from attention so far
[2,3]. Just considering the many dozens of additional
hypothetical human protein sequences with low but statistically significant sequence-similarity to known metabolic enzymes that can be collected with PSI-BLAST
searches [4], more such findings are still expected to be
ahead.
One of the key steps in energy metabolism is the separation of fatty acids from glycerol moieties. A diverse set of
lipases performs this task in various contexts by hydrolyzing the connecting ester-bonds [5]. One of the best characterized lipases, pancreatic lipase, acts at the stage of food
digestion [6]. Other lipases, such as hormone sensitive
lipase or lipoprotein lipase, are involved in lipid accumulation and release in tissue [7,8].
Most lipases share a common type of 3D structure known
as α/β-hydrolase fold, which is present in enzymes with
quite diverse substrate specificities [9,10]. The catalytic
mechanism of most lipases is reminescent of serine proteases as it proceeds via the nucleophilic attack of a serinehistidine-aspartate triad [10].
The recently discovered, novel key enzyme involved in
fatty acid release from adipocytes, adipose triglyceride
lipase (ATGL) [1], does not share any direct sequence similarity with known mammalian lipases. In fact, it appears
to belong to a protein family that is centered around patatin, a potato storage protein with lipid acyl hydrolase
activity [11,12]. The catalytic mechanism of these
enzymes is inherently different from classic lipases as it
proceeds via a serine-aspartate dyad [13,14] as opposed to
the well described serine-histidine-aspartate triad.
In this work, we present sequence-analytic evidence that
the ATGL/patatin family and the classic mammalian
lipases represented by the human pancreatic lipase
evolved from a common ancestor. Moreover, we display a
set of structural and sequence key features that are conserved between these two enzyme groups including also
related protein families.

The analysis of homology relationships within large
superfamilies of protein sequences are a reoccurring
theme in biomolecular sequence analysis. Finding the
pancreatic lipase/ATGL relationship is just one application for the respective methodologies. It should be noted
that detecting subtle yet statistically significant and structurally plausible relationships in families involving thousands of members is not a straightforward task since the
manual analysis of myriads of reports generated by standard BLAST/PSI-BLAST [4] installations for sequence comparisons in databases is impossible in practice. Progress in
this area was hampered by insufficiently developed tools.
Here, we developed a computer implementation of a family searching heuristic involving: (i) Automated invocation of fan-like iterative PSI-BLAST [4] searches with
starting sequences. (ii) Filtering of starting sequences with
various sequence-analytic methods for detecting compositional and repetitive pattern bias. (iii) Automatic re-detection of starting sequence segments in reciprocal searches.
(iv) Criteria for alignment length and overlap with the
starting sequence segments. (v) Automated parsing of outputs and (vi) database-supported analysis of similarity
networks. The user-parameterized measures (ii-iv) are
designed to suppress the detection of unrelated hits for
the case of a starting sequence that are thought to represent a single globular domain, a functionally and structurally
independent
elementary
module.
This
FAMILYSEARCHER is part of the sequence-analytic workbench ANNIE [15] that is being developed in our laboratory. To our knowledge, this article describes the first
software package for sequence family collection with fully
automated checks for bidirectional search criteria, transitive hit overlap criteria and generic procedures for masking repetitive regions that is applicable for extremely large
sequence families.

Results
FAMILYSEARCHER: Methodical specifics of analyzing
homology relationships in large sequence families
The concept of sequence homology is a powerful
approach to organize the sequence space of known proteins and to generate hypotheses on the function and evolutionary origin of yet uncharacterized proteins [16]. If a
protein sequence segment "A" without compositional or
pattern bias is used as a starting point in a search for similar proteins and reveals a sequence "B" as a hit, the
respective two sequences are considered homologous and
a common evolutionary ancestor can be postulated. The
direct connection between these two sequences is called a
unidirectional link if "A" finds "B" and a bidirectional one
if the reciprocal search started with "B" also reveals "A" as
homologue. If two protein sequence segments "A" and
"B" do not have a direct link but are significantly similar
to the same sequence region of an intermediary protein
"I", all three sequences are considered homologous. This

Set of nine intermediate sequences linking pancreatic lipase with patatin. The accessions of the two starting
sequences of FAMILYSEARCHER and the nine intermediates are enclosed in boxes. The large arrows to the left side represent
path components found by FAMILYSEARCHER using the respective global starting sequences. The thin arrows between boxes
represent directional links found with PSI-BLAST [4] (direction from starting sequence to hit) and are labeled with the corresponding round number of first significant detection (in parentheses) and the inclusion E-value. In addition to the full path, two
shortcuts are displayed. The respective alignment regions are (from the top to the bottom, segment boundaries in brackets):
AAT95008 [79–249], NP_946830 [63–209], NP_771800 [64–211], YP_049079 [81–177], NP_693664 [158–398], NP_296855
[21–118], NP_799564 [77–124], YP_013380 [8–60] via direct path and [9–119] via shortcut, EAL03661 [423–518] from the
YP_013380 side and [397–579] from patatin side. It is important to assure that the connection to EAL03661 and the other
intermediates is in the same region regardless of the side of the path (pancreatic lipase or patatin) the search was started.
Examining the corresponding PSI-BLAST generated alignments reveals that the boundaries of the alignment starting from the
pancreatic side (423 – 518) are completely contained within the alignment starting from the patatin side (397 – 579) of the
path.

space relating two homologous proteins is termed a path.
Studying distant homology relationships of densely populated protein clusters of the sequence space with thousands of similar sequences is a complicated endeavor.
BLAST/PSI_BLAST searches [4] are not commutative with
respect to exchanges of starting and hit sequences and
slightly differing queries can collect largely different families. Therefore, only exhaustive searches involving all

potential family members as start sequences can assure
that the maximal number of sequence family members is
found. This procedure also ensures that non-trivial paths
to new proteins that are unexpectedly related are determined. For the analysis of large families, this implies
thousands or tens of thousands of database searches.
Although performance and costs of compute servers and
storage devices have improved, it is still early to launch
such calculations without well-thought selection of a
starting protein segment (cluster-based compute-server
costs of days/weeks and storage needs in 10-2-101 TB).

Besides the hardware issues, software solutions are necessary to automatically guide the search process and to analyze the huge amount of data generated.
Within our ANNIE suite [15], we have developed FAMILYSEARCHER, a generic environment for protein sequence
family collection (see Methods for details). The procedure
is organized in stages. At the beginning of each stage "n",
the starting sequence segments (at the first stage n = 1: the
user-defined segment) are freed from regions with compositional and repetitive pattern bias and PSI-BLAST [4]
searches are started with them. Hit segments are collected,
parsed and the new hits represent the start sequences for
the next stage "n+1". It is possible to exclude candidates
that are not confirmed by reciprocal checks; i.e., the
requirement that the starting sequence at stage "n+1"
should find back the same region of the starting sequence
at stage "n" that lead to its own selection as a hit (establishment of bi-directional hits). After completion of a predefined maximal number of stages (or the procedures
converge prematurely if no new hits are found), the links
are stored in a database and paths between hits are analyzed. This strategy has already been successfully applied
to reconstruct entire sequence families for smaller
sequence groups (for example [17-20]) in similar contexts
where a simpler procedure was applied.
Paths of links in the sequence space with statistically
significant sequence similarity between the groups of
ATGL/patatin and classical lipases do exist
To search for a connection between classic lipases and
ATGL, we selected the lipolytic domains of one well-characterized protein for each sequence family as a starting
sequence set. We used regions of the pancreatic lipase
(accession: P16233, residues 17–351) and of the potato
tuber protein patatin (accession: CAA27571, residues 32–
320) for two separate familysearcher processes. After performing up to seven stages of the collection procedure for
either of the FAMILYSEARCHER processes (i.e., iterative
PSI-BLAST searches from both directions; in total 30598
individual searches and 22082 protein hits with paths
consisting at least of unidirectional links to any of the two
starting sequences), we indeed obtained a set of 12662
paths that connect these two query sequences. For one set
of nine intermediate sequences establishing a connection
between the two starting targets, several paths are depicted
in Figure 1.

There are paths that consist fully of bidirectional links
(i.e., the similarity relationship is confirmed by reciprocal
searches) with the sole exception of the links connecting a
representative of the classical lipase group to the potential
patatin-like phospholipase EAL03661. For example (see
Figure 1), the connection between YP_013380 (hydrolase,
α/β fold) and EAL03661 (potential patatin-like phos-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/164

pholipase) can only be established from the pancreatic
lipase side of the path. Closer examination of significances reveals that the links at this stage are also among the
weakest and appear to represent the "missing link"
between the two sequence families. There are other paths
between the two starting sequences avoiding EAL03661
but the respective significances are worse and the alignments are shorter (data not shown). Known 3D structures
that are most closely related to the proteins included in
the path of Figure 1 are listed in Table 1. Obviously, the
SCOP and CATH identifiers above EAL03661 correspond
to variations within a single superfamily (c.69.1 and
3.40.50.1820 respectively). The step to the ATGL/patatin
group involves a change in fold (SCOP c.19.1.3). Figure 1
also shows that there are several "shortcuts". These are
links between non-adjacent intermediates in the path
with a maximal fraction of bidirectional links that,
although being significant, lack a confirmation from
reciprocal searches. Known 3D structures that are most
closely related to the proteins included in the path of Figure 1 are listed in Table 1.
It should be noted that the FAMILYSEARCHER run had to
be halted because of computational time and storage
space constraints. At the given point, the algorithm had
been running on 70 CPUs for 10 days while it had produced about 1 Terabyte of data. Since the main aim of
uncovering a link between the two families of lipases had
been accomplished (a number of potential links had
already been found), it was decided to stop the run and
investigate the obtained results in detail. It can be
expected that other "missing links" or even further related
protein families remain to be found despite of the variety
of proteins and enzymes that were already detected to be
related to the two lipase families.
The ancestral module common to the ATGL/patatin and
classical lipase families consists of a three-strand β-sheet,
an α-helix and a turn with the active site serine
The set of protein segments collected by FAMILYSEARCHER has a common region of homology that forms
the basis for the path in the sequence space connecting the
pancreatic lipase group with patatin/ATGL. This common
region can be distilled by analyzing the PSI-BLAST generated pairwise alignments, by 3D structural considerations
and by investigating conservation patterns in sequence
subfamilies (see Methods). An alignment of the respective
sequence regions involving the path members from Figure
1 (11 sequences), representatives from most major clusters as well as their most similar sequences with atomlevel resolved 3D structure is shown in Figure 2 (in total
63 sequences). The common region of similarity involves
50–70 residues and is sometimes interrupted by inserts.
We suggest that these 50–70 residues represent an ancestral sequence module that, at the beginning of its evolu-

The conserved ancestral core module: The phylogenetic tree. The tree depicts the evolutionary relationship between
the sequence segments that are included in the multiple alignment (Figure 2). The upper part of the tree contains the protein
segments that were found with pancreatic lipase as seed for the FAMILYSEARCHER procedure, while the lower part contains
the results of the patatin family-search. The starting sequences for the iterative procedures each have an asterix between
parentheses (*) after the accession number. Important spots of the tree are marked by a bracket that is followed by a short
description. Here, the classic lipases in the alignment are hepatic lipase (AAA59221), lipoprotein lipase (AAP35372), endothelial lipase (NP_006024) and pancreatic lipase (P16233). The bottom of the tree also contains three type A2 cytosolic phospholipases. Besides patatin (1OXW, [13]), this is the second type of protein from the pooled results that has been shown to
function via a catalytic dyad (1CJY, [14]).

tion, might have been without inserted regions. It is
interesting to note that this module contains only a part
of the catalytic core, namely the nucleophilic serine,
which is either involved in an enzymatic triad (proteins
found with pancreatic lipase as seed) or dyad mechanism
(proteins found with patatin as seed). The sequence
regions that encompass the remaining catalytically active
residues are too divergent among many subfamilies to
deduce an ancestral relationship and, thus, could not be
incorporated into the multiple alignment, which represents the whole sequence group (see also structural analyses of spatial location conservation further below). The
phylogeny of the sequence segments from the alignment
(Figure 3) is in agreement with the supposed evolutionary
position of the intermediate sequences found in the path.
From the viewpoint of molecular function, these homologues are not limited to lipases and esterases, but include
large sets of proteins that act on various other types of substrates. Among these enzymes are proteins such as
polyketide synthases, dienelactone hydrolases or aminopeptidases (see legend to Figure 2 and data not shown).
As we did not reconstruct the entire encompassing protein
family, we expect that more proteins with alternative substrate specificities might be detected in rigorous searches.
Nevertheless, the variety of enzymes found in this work
clearly demonstrates the ubiquitousness of the ancestral
module.

Structural patatin

1N8S [27] (A, segments 68–77, 144–166, 170–176), patatin
1OXW [13] (C, segments 28–37, 70–87, 148–158) and a
superposition of both (B). The module starts with a β-strand
(β-2) that is followed by another β-strand (β-1), an α-helix
(α+1) and a β-strand (β+1). Numbers in parentheses indicate
the relative positions to the nucleophilic elbow in the protein
sequence. This loop is crucial for catalytic activity and typically contains a catalytic serine. It is located between the
adjacent secondary structure elements β-1 and α+1. The connections to the other β-strands (β-2 and β+1) are not direct
and can include longer stretches of additional secondary
structure.

Visual inspection of 3D structures of proteins encountered
during the search at regions involved in the alignment of
Figure 2 reveals a set of conserved structural elements.
These consist of three parallel β-strands and an α-helix
located between the second and third strand. The characteristic nucleophilic elbow of esterases is located in the
loop between the end of the second beta-strand and the
start of the alpha-helix. Considering the locations of the
secondary structural elements with respect to the nucleophilic elbow, we introduce the following numbering: β-2
and β-1 for the strands that are upstream of the nucleophilic residue, and α+1 and β+1 for the structures that lie
downstream of the elbow. The core structural elements are
depicted in Figure 4.
Only few automated structure comparison tools such as
CE [21] can delineate common substructures from otherwise differing protein structures. It is interesting to note
that this program does not find the ancestral core module
if it is confronted with the complete 3D structures of the
respective proteins. We generated pairwise structural
superposition of a set of 13 3D structures (set of 11 structures – 4TGL [22], 1JKM [23], 1TCB [24], 1EX9 [25],
1KU0 [26], 1N8S [27], 1VLQ (unpublished), 1DIN [28],

the query, and a set of two structures – 1OXW [13], 1CJY
[14] – from the ATGL-side). For the 55 superposed pairs
of α/β-hydrolase structures belonging to the pancreatic
lipase group, 32 aligned with scores at family level similarity (Z-score > 4.5), 11 with superfamily level similarity
(Z-score between 4.0 and 4.5), 6 in the twilight zone (Zscore between 3.7 and 4.0), and 6 with low significance
similarity with Z-scores between 2.6 and 3.7. Moreover,
the secondary structural elements β-1 and α+1 including
the active nucleophilic residue were correctly aligned for
each pair of structures, regardless of the significance level.
The same observation could be made for the 2 structures
from the ATGL-side (high, family-level Z-score = 5.0).
However, no alignment could be generated by CE
between any structure from the classic lipase set and any
from the ATGL side. We concluded that fold similarities
are restricted to a small part of the structure – the conserved ancestral module – and that this stretch is simply
too short to provide significant results because the
remainder of the fold could not be aligned by the CE program.
To test this hypothesis, we generated structural alignments
between the set of 11 structures and 2 different substretches of the crystal structures from the ATGL-side: (i)
The entire core module ranging from β-2 to β+1 including
also inserted secondary structure elements (1CJY: Val187
– Lys335, 1OXW: Leu25 – Lys158). (ii) The part of the
core module that encompasses the nucleophilic elbow
from β-1 to α+1 (1CJY: Ala221 – Ser239, 1OXW: Phe70 –
Ser87). In the former case, a nearly correct structural
superposition (max. shift of 0–3 residues in the nucleophilic elbow) could be obtained for about half of the
alignments, yet with low-significance similarity levels corresponding to Z-scores between 1.6 and 3.7. In the latter
case, all core elements were correctly aligned to the subject
structures. The low Z-scores of 2.6–2.8 obtained in this
context are a result of the shortness of the stretch. As the
significance measure is dependent on the length of the
region, even the cores of the highly similar structures 1CJY
and 1OXW align with a Z-score of only 3.1. These results
indicate that structural similarities limited to the ancestral
core module do exist, even though fold and sequences
may be different for classic lipases and ATGL.

Discussion and conclusion
The analyses of homology relationships between
sequences of large superfamilies were previously hampered by the insufficiency of the available computer-based
methods and corresponding tools. For example, confirming an evolutionary relationship between classical lipases
clustered around pancreatic lipase and the ATGL/patatin
group is a difficult task not only because the relationship
is distant, the similarity is subtle and the respective common region involves a substructure interrupted with inser-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/164

tions. The group of sequences that are very similar to
classical lipases is so large (with tens of thousands of
members) that most database searches started with their
representatives get obliterated with closely related group
members. It becomes a major problem to identify proteins that are located at the boundary of this cluster and
give hope to discover new links to outside protein groups
if used as a starting sequence. On the other side, sequence
diversity among the ATGL/patatin group is obviously not
large enough to generate a profile that is sufficiently rich
to establish the link to classical lipases. Analyzing distant
evolutionary relationships of very large protein families
requires automatic methods for collection of homologous
families if one does not wish to transform each new problem case into an art for ingeniously finding the critical
links. The FAMILYSEARCHER within the ANNIE environment is the solution for this problem. Since automatic
family collection is not corrected on the fly by the watchful eye of an experienced human sequence analyzer, special precautions with regard to removing compositional
and repetitive pattern bias, to reciprocal searches and to
checking whether hits fall into the same region of starting
sequences are necessary to prevent the procedure walking
astray. Our experience has shown that the application of
the search constraints described in the Methods section
has always led to convergence except for the case of
known very large groups such as the pancreatic lipase/
ATGL/patatin group described in this article (rather a
problem of the technical equipment than a principal
issue).
In this work, we have identified an ancestral core module
consisting of 50–70 residues with a three-strand parallel
β-sheet, an α-helix and a turn involving the catalytic serine
as substructure with likely common evolutionary origin
within the joint classical-lipase/ATGL/patatin cluster. The
mere similarity of relative spatial location of some secondary structural elements close to the catalytic serine did
not escape the attention of Rydel et al. [13], who compared the structures 3TGL (Rhizomucor miehei lipase) and
1OXW (patatin) visually and aligned 34 backbone Cαatoms. We find that the similarity between the various
proteins is limited to the ancestral module (as a result of
divergent evolution) but remnant sequence similarity is
still detectable with significance. Reduction of overall
sequence and structure similarity to a small core module
has already been described for other protein families. For
example, the Tudor domain "Royal Family" contains a ββ-β-α-310 core with suggested methyl substrate binding
function as a common feature of the superfamily [32].
ATGL and classic lipases have fundamental differences
with respect to the catalytic mechanism as well as overall
fold but both catalyze triglyceride hydrolysis. This suggests that they might have acquired the same function

from different predecessor enzymes that are, in turn,
derived from the common ancestral module.
If the enzymatic core module is really ancestral, there
should be a correspondence with closed loop prototypes
that have been described by Berezovsky et al. [33-35].
Indeed, prototype P1 and the related prototype P3 have
structural (β-α element) and sequence similarity (~30%
sequence identity to exemplary sequences) to the ~30 residue region (β-1α+1) that also encompasses the nucleophilic elbow in the ancestral module (data not shown).
In prokaryotes, the P1-containing region corresponds to
the P-loop or ATP/GTP-binding motif with the consensus
[AG]-x(4)-G-K-[ST]. This tiny-residue motif is similar to
the GXSXG stretch followed by further small residues
between β-1 and α+1 in the collected family (Figure 2). The
relationship of flanking beta-strands (β-2 and β+1) with
currently described prototypes is unclear. It is possible
that they are parts of alternative closed loop structures that
might be different between the patatin-like proteins and
classic lipases and, thus, exemplifies emergence of/divergence to distinct functions from the common structural
ancestor via sequence modification.
Apparently, this β-β-α-β core module was present as an
ancestral enzyme that provided basic capabilities for
nucleophilic attack mechanisms. In fact, this single mechanism has been evolutionarily extremely successful for
many substrates and reaction variants, since the classicallipase/ATGL/patatin cluster contains numerous enzymes
that are neither lipases nor esterases, such as polyketide
synthases, dienelactone hydrolases or aminopeptidases
(see legend of figure 2 and data not shown).
A striking feature of this mechanism is the discrepancy
between high sequence variability and very constrained
spatial restrictions for the catalytic center. For proteins
that use catalytic triads, the regions that encompass the
typical catalytic aspartate and histidine residues are not
conserved at all. Not only can the 2D structures of these
protein stretches be completely different, but also the
sequence positions of these residues relative to the nucleophilic residue (the typical serine) vary considerably. For
example, while the catalytic Asp of pancreatic lipase
(1N8S, [27]) was shown to reside directly at the C-terminal end of the β+1 strand, it is located in long loop region
more than 80 residues downstream of the active-site serine in the C. antarctica lipase (1TCB, [24]) Nonetheless,
the distances of the catalytic residues in the 3D structures
of the obtained sequences are relatively constant (for the
respective structures in Table 1: SerO-HisN 2.6–3.6Å,
HisN-AspCγ 3.3–3.6Å, SerO-AspCγ 7.0–8.4Å), most probably a result of the fact that the enzymatic mechanism crucially depends on a correct spatial arrangement of the
catalytic residues.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/164

If proteins carrying these modules indeed shared a common origin, then the sequence variability in the additional regions (that encompass the catalytic amino acids
other than the nucleophilic residue) would appear to have
enabled the emergence of at least two different enzymatic
mechanisms: One relies on a catalytic triad and the other
one on a dyad. But which mechanism is the ancestral one?
Did the histidine get deleted from the triad, resulting in a
protein family that uses Ser-Asp dyads, or was it inserted
into an ancestral dyad, leading to the archetypical Ser-HisAsp triad? Assuming an evolution from more simple to
more complex mechanisms, the His-insertion version
appears more reasonable. The emergence of a catalytically
active fold should be more probable if the number of residues that need to be brought into vicinity is limited to
two, not three. Considering the evolutionary flexibility
regarding the relative positions of the catalytic amino
acids in the protein sequences, a third residue may then
easily have been inserted during the sequence evolution
history. Moreover, not only the regions around the Asp or
Asp/His catalytic residues are highly diverse. Various additional modules have been inserted into the sequence,
apparently, depending on the physiological environment,
substrate specificity or regulation requirements. The
ancestral fold template for breaking bonds using nucleophilic attacks seems to have been so "popular" in evolution that it became the origin for an extremely diverse and
ubiquitous superfamily of proteins.

Methods
FAMILYSEARCHER
We used a multi-step iterative approach to collect a family
of related proteins. First, a seed sequence (for example,
pancreatic lipase or patatin) is masked by running SEG
[36] (parametrization: window length 12 and complexity
thresholds K1 = 2.2 and K2 = 2.5) and an own implementation of the COILS algorithm [37] (window length 21,
probability threshold 0.5 both for the standard and polar
weighting modes) in order to prevent low-complexity and
coiled-coil regions from producing evolutionarily unrelated hits. The PSI-BLAST algorithm [4] is then run against
the non redundant (nr) database from NCBI to collect an
initial family of proteins (matrix BLOSUM62, inclusion
cutoff E = 0.001, maximal number of rounds is 10, the
internal filter is switched off). The alignment portion of
each of the hit sequences is cut out. After adding up to 5
residues of the hit sequence on each side, it is subjected to
the same masking procedure, and then fed into the PSIBLAST algorithm. The previous steps are then repeated in
order to gather more distant homologues. With a slight
loss of sensitivity but with a dramatic gain in computation
speed, it is possible to exclude new database searches with
sequences that are highly similar (e.g., 99% sequence
identity) to previous start sequences but this shortcut
option was not used in this work.

The described procedure carries the risk of picking up
unrelated sequences and, consequently, expanding into a
large part of the sequence universe. Therefore, we used
additional constraints in deciding, which sequences are
eligible for family membership and for becoming seeds in
the next round. We require a minimum alignment length
with the starting sequence of 40 residues and an overlap
of the starting segment of at least two thirds. The minimum alignment length and overlap criteria are justified if
we assume that the starting sequence represents an individual globular domain, a structural and functional unit.
Additionally, we have implemented bi-directionality criteria that we call 'grand-daddy-check' and 'auntie-check'.
When a sequence "A" belongs to a set of starting
sequences at stage "n" of the family searcher and finds
some new hit sequence "B", this "B" enters the set of starting sequences at stage "n+1" of FAMILYSEARCHER. If "B"
finds "A" back in its PSI-BLAST searched and the E-value
is below a critical value (here: E = 0.01), "B" is called to
have passed the grand-daddy-check. If "B" finds not "A"
but any other sequence out of the starting set at stage "n"
with the critical E-value, it is called to have passed the
auntie-check. Obviously, the auntie-check is a more
relaxed condition than the grand-daddy check. Our proposed strategy is to first start with a very stringent criterion
and to see if the family converges within a certain number
of rounds. If this is the case, the more relaxed auntie-check
might yield additional members.
In this work, only hits originating from starting sequences
that have passed the grand-daddy-check are used for
enlarging the cluster at higher stages of FAMILYSEARCHER. This leads to a significant reduction in fanning out. As an example, round 2 identifies 1322
potential sequences for further enlargement but, after
applying the grand-daddy-check, only 395 are propagated
to the next round. It should be noted that, in our experience of applying the grand-daddy check, most of the protein families converge within a few rounds of the
FAMILYSEARCHER. To make this reciprocal checking
work at the beginning stage of the procedure, we either
generate a new non-redundant database with the userdefined starting sequences included or consider any
sequence found with E-value<1.e-8 by the starting segment as "grand daddy". Finally, any family search is limited in the number of rounds to avoid the principally not
excluded case of unlimited, excessive expansion of the
family by the underlying search algorithm (here: PSIBLAST).
The FAMILYSEARCHER is one of the integrated algorithms within the ANNIE environment [15] and is available to power users by default. The ANNIE software suite
including the FAMILYSEARCHER runs on two 4-processor
Opteron SUN VZ40 with 32 GB RAM (an application

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/164

server and a database server). The sequence-analytic programs (PSI-BLASTs and sequence filters) were computed
on a 70 CPU "Opteron" cluster. Both raw results and the
ANNIE database were located on a Netapp filer. In order
to cope with the large concurrent data streams generated
by cluster nodes and the database server, it was inevitable
to tune the NFS file system parameters leading to an I/O
throughput performance gain of ~30%. Interested partners can apply for assistance in setting up local versions of
ANNIE.
Alignment and phylogenetic tree generation
The selection of appropriate sequences for the multiple
alignment of Figure 2 started with a grouping of the set of
protein segments collected by FAMILYSEARCHER using
the MCL graph clustering algorithm (parameters: inflation 1.002, scheme 7; [38,39]). This procedure, which was
performed after the iterative search was completed,
allowed us to select a set of representative protein
sequences from individual clusters that cover most of the
implicated sequence space. The next step consisted in the
automatic generation of two separate multiple alignments
using the PROBCONS program [40]: one for the selected
sequences from the set which was obtained using pancreatic lipase as seed, and the other one for the patatin/ATGLrelated sequences. The multiple alignments that were
obtained in this way served as an initial guideline but
were partially inaccurate in the context of 3D structural
considerations and, thus, had to be manually curated. To
this end, we generated pairwise structural superpositions
between the sequences of each alignment with known
crystal structures (see figure 2 for the utilized sequences)
and the structure of either pancreatic lipase or patatin as
reference. These superpositions were performed using the
"fit-selected-residues" functionality of the SWISSPDBViewer program [41]. We used the backbone C-atoms of
the catalytic nucleophilic residue (serine of cysteine)
together with those from the 10 flanking residues as templates. Superposed amino acids from the conserved structural elements were then manually corrected in the
multiple alignments. Sequences without resolved 3D
structures were aligned to the most closely related protein
in the alignment for which the crystal structure was
known also with the consideration of pairwise alignments
generated by the PSI-BLAST searches. Finally, the alignments were merged into a single alignment and curated
using the same procedure.

The phylogenetic tree of the alignment sequences was
constructed with the PHYLO_WIN tool [42] using the
neighbour joining method [43] in combination with the
"observed divergence" distance option from the tool. The
48 positions of the multiple alignment that did not contain any gaps served as a basis for tree calculation. Tree

drawing and labelling was done with the TreeGraph program [44].
3D structure representation and comparisons
3D protein structures were obtained from the RSCB Protein Data Bank [45]. Analysis and display of these structures was performed using the SWISSPDB-Viewer [41]
program. The CE program [21] was used to automatically
construct a set of structural superpositions. CE produces
Z-scores on the basis of an underlying probability model.
These Z-scores are used to estimate the degree of similarity
between superposed structures and can be interpreted
using significance tables that are provided with each distribution of the CE tool (Z > 4.5: family level similarity;
4.0 – 4.5: superfamily level similarities; 3.7 – 4.0: twilight
zone; Z < 3.7: similarities with low significance).
