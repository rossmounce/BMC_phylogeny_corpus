Abstract
Background: Microsatellite (SSR) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers are widely
used in plant breeding and genomic research. Thus, methods to improve the speed and efficiency
of SSR and SNP genotyping are highly desirable. Here we describe a new method for multiplex PCR
that facilitates fluorescence-based SSR genotyping and the multiplexed preparation of DNA
templates for SNP assays.
Results: We show that multiplex-ready PCR can achieve a high (92%) success rate for the
amplification of published sequences under standardised reaction conditions, with a PCR specificity
comparable to that of conventional PCR methods. We also demonstrate that multiplex-ready PCR
supports an improved level of multiplexing in plant genomes of varying size and ploidy, without the
need to carefully optimize assay conditions. Several advantages of multiplex-ready PCR for SSR and
SNP genotyping are demonstrated and discussed. These include the uniform amplification of target
sequences within multiplexed reactions and between independent assays, and the ability to label
amplicons during PCR with specialised moieties such fluorescent dyes and biotin.
Conclusion: Multiplex-ready PCR provides several technological advantages that can facilitate
fluorescence-based SSR genotyping and the multiplexed preparation of DNA templates for SNP
assays. These advantages can be captured at several points in the genotyping process, and offer
considerable cost and labour savings. Multiplex-ready PCR is broadly applicable to plant genomics
and marker assisted breeding, and should be transferable to any animal or plant species.

Background
Molecular markers based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are widely used in plant breeding and genetic
research. For example, they are the basis for the mapping
of genes and quantitative trait loci (QTL), marker assisted
breeding, phylogenetic studies and comparative genomics

[1-4]. In particular, two types of marker are best suited for
these applications: single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) and microsatellites (SSRs). To date, almost all
methods published for SNP detection in plants consist of
two steps: amplification (usually by PCR) of a target
sequence harbouring the polymorphism, followed by

detection of the SNP. Methods based on hybridization,
polymerization, ligation and nucleolysis have been used
to interrogate the SNP (see [5-7] for reviews). In contrast,
capillary and gel electrophoresis coupled with fluorescence-based detection is the most commonly reported
method for the assay of SSRs.
Methods to improve the speed and efficiency of SNP and
SSR genotyping are integral to the application of molecular markers in plant breeding and research. Multiplex
PCR, in which several markers are simultaneously amplified in the same reaction, is used to increase the amount
of information generated per assay, and to reduce consumable and labour costs [8]. The M13-tailed primer
method [9] is often used for the assay of SSRs to reduce
the cost of fluorescent primer labelling, which is typically
five to ten times more expensive than the synthesis of an
unlabeled primer. In this three primer strategy, PCR is performed using a forward primer with a nucleotide extension at its 5'-end, identical to the sequence of an M13
sequencing primer, a standard length reverse primer and a
fluorescently labelled M13 primer. During PCR, the SSR
product is fluorescently labelled following participation
of the M13 primer after the first few cycles of amplification. Therefore, instead of synthesizing one specific fluorescently labelled primer for each SSR marker, only a dye
labelled M13 primer is needed. The M13-tailed primer
method has also been used to modify target sequences
harbouring SNPs during PCR amplification [10,11].
The development of multiplex PCR assays in plants can be
difficult due to large genome sizes and polyploidy. For
example, extensive optimisation is typically required for
multiplex SSR amplification in bread wheat [12], one of
the world's most important cereal crops. Bread wheat is an
allohexaploid with a large and complex genome, comprised of paralogous gene families and about 75% repetitive DNA [13]. The routine development of multiplex PCR
assays in crop species with smaller diploid genomes can
also be challenging [14,15]. The bottlenecks for multiplex
PCR are mainly undesirable primer-primer interactions
and non-specific amplification [16]. Similarly, the use of
a tailed forward primer and a standard length reverse
primer in the M13-tailed primer method can promote the
amplification of non-specific products. Therefore, the
PCR conditions required for amplification using the M13tailed primer method are often different to those optimal
for amplification using standard length primers.
Here, we present a new method for multiplex PCR that
simplifies assay development and provides several technological advantages that facilitate fluorescence-based
SSR genotyping and the multiplexed preparation of DNA
templates for SNP detection. This method, termed multiplex-ready PCR, combines the advantages of the M13-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/80

tailed primer method and multiplex PCR in a single step,
closed tube assay. It does not rely on expensive reagents,
is suitable for the amplification of any published
sequence and requires only the synthesis of primers in the
multiplex-ready format for its deployment. Multiplexready PCR is evaluated in three plant genera with different
genome sizes and ploidy: Prunus spp. (apricot and
cherry), Hordeum spp. (barley) and Triticum spp. (bread
wheat), which have genome sizes of about 300, 5200 and
16000 mega base pairs (Mbp), respectively.

Results
Evaluation of multiplex-ready PCR
To assess the amplification of target sequences using multiplex-ready PCR, published SSR primer sets for apricot,
cherry, barley and bread wheat were tested. Initially, we
determined the optimal concentration of locus-specific
primer that was required to achieve strong amplification
of a PCR fragment(s) of the expected size. Adjustment of
the locus-specific primer concentration for individual
primer sets was found to be necessary for satisfactory
amplification yield and to reduce non-specific amplification. A subset (64) of the published SSRs were also amplified in uniplex reactions by conventional and multiplexready PCR, where conventional PCR was performed using
optimal conditions for each marker. These results showed
that the PCR specificity and genotyping accuracy of both
methods was indistinguishable, except for a 30-bp fragment size offset resulting from the addition of the tag
primer sequences to the 5'-ends of the multiplex-ready
PCR products (Figure 1).

To date, we have achieved a 92% success rate for the multiplex-ready amplification of more than 2800 published
SSRs under standardised reaction conditions that differ
only by the concentration of locus-specific primer [17]. A
similar success rate has also been achieved for the amplification of barley sequences harbouring published SNPs.
The SSRs and SNPs used in the present study are described
in Additional File 1.
Development of multiplexed assays
Uniform product abundance is an important feature of
any multiplex amplification method, especially for highly
paralleled SSR genotyping and the preparation of samples
for SNP detection assays. To determine if multiplex-ready
PCR amplifies a similar amount of product for each
primer set within a multiplexed assay, and between independent reactions, two experiments were performed.

In the first experiment, we performed 32 six-plex PCR
assays in each of apricot and cherry, and 32 four-plex and
48 six-plex PCRs in each of barley and bread wheat using
published SSR primer sets and six to eight genetically
diverse lines. The choice of four- and six-plex assays was

and 60°C, respectively. PCR products were separated on a GelScan2000 instrument.

due to the limited size range of PCR fragments amplified
by the published SSRs and the requirement to construct
marker panels with non-overlapping allele sizes. The
amount of SSR product amplified in the multiplexed reactions was assessed following ABI3730 separation using
GeneMapper software by measuring the fluorescence
intensity for each marker. A standardised procedure was
used to prepare the SSR products for electrophoresis to
ensure that the fluorescence intensity observed for each
SSR was representative of its amplification yield within a
multiplexed reaction, and to allow marker yield between
independent assays to be compared (see Materials and
Methods).
Frequency distribution analysis showed that 85% (1045/
1216) of the SSRs present in the multiplexed PCRs were
successfully amplified, as assessed by ABI3730 fluorescence intensities that fell within a range optimal for semiautomated allele sizing, i.e. 1000–15000 relative fluorescence units (rfu). Sixty eight percent of the SSR alleles had
a fluorescence intensity within the range of 2000–10000

rfu. These results indicated that a scorable amount of
product was amplified for each primer set within the multiplex PCRs and between independent reactions (Figure
2). Visual inspection of the ABI electrotraces revealed that
the main cause of variation in fluorescence intensities was
SSR stutter bands, with markers producing stutter bands
typically having lower fluorescence intensity than those
with no or few stutter bands.
Of the 64 six-plex PCRs performed in apricot and cherry,
36 (56%) amplified all six SSRs and 26 (41%) amplified
four or more SSRs (Table 1). Of the 48 six-plex PCRs performed in each of barley and bread wheat, 19 (40%) and
13 (27%) amplified all six SSRs, and 23 (48%) and 26
(54%) amplified four or more SSRs, respectively. An
improved success rate was observed for the four-plex PCRs
tested, with 24 (75%) and 22 (69%) amplifying all four
SSRs in barley and bread wheat, respectively. SSRs were
considered to have failed when they did not produce fluorescence intensities within the optimal range for all of
the DNA samples tested, or failed to amplify PCR frag-

the same DNA samples. Non-specific fragments were
observed in some cases but these did not interfere with
marker scoring. In general, the PCR specificity achieved in
the multiplex PCRs was sufficient to allow unambiguous

SSR scoring on a number of detection platforms (Figures

published SNPs from 16 barley lines with known SNP
genotypes determined from uniplex reactions. To allow
the success rate for the amplification of target sequences in
multiplex-ready PCR to be quantified, the assays were also
performed using conventional multiplex PCR and standard length primers. Both types of multiplex PCR assay
were performed under standardised conditions (see Materials and Methods). The success of each multiplexed reaction was determined by assaying the SNPs harboured in
the resulting PCR products and assessing the concordance
of the SNP genotypes with those determined in uniplex
reactions.

Overall, 95% (91/96) and 80% (115/144) of the SNP loci
assayed in the reaction products of the four- and six-plex
multiplex-ready PCRs were successfully detected, respectively, with complete genotype concordance between uniplex and multiplex reactions. Sixteen (67%) of the 24 sixplex PCRs amplified five or more SNP loci, and all of the
24 four-plexes amplified three or more SNP loci. In contrast, only 60% (58/96) and 36% (52/144) of the SNP loci
assayed in the reaction products of the four- and six-plexes
performed using conventional multiplex PCR were successfully detected, respectively. None of the 24 six-plex
PCRs amplified five or more SNP loci, and only half of the
four-plex assays amplified three or more SNP loci (Table

kinetics [11,21]. This provides for more uniform amplification of the target sequences during the second stage of
amplification, and results in a similar yield of PCR product for each target locus within a multiplexed reaction.

Discussion
While the use of molecular markers in plant breeding and
research is well documented [18,19], the application of
multiplex PCR in plants is not widely reported due to the
difficulties associated with assay development. New
approaches to simplify the development of multiplex PCR
assays to improve genotyping throughput and reduce
costs for SNP and SSR analysis have the potential to
increase the speed and efficiency of plant breeding and
genetic research.
Principles of multiplex-ready PCR
Multiplex-ready PCR combines the principles of the M13tailed primer method [10] and two-step multiplex PCR
amplification [11,20]. The assay comprises a single-step,
closed-tube reaction in which PCR amplification takes
place in two stages (Figure 5).

In the first stage, low concentrations of locus-specific
primers tagged at their 5'-ends with generic nucleotide
sequences amplify the target loci from genomic DNA. The
locus-specific primers become fully incorporated into
PCR product, which have the generic nucleotide tag
sequences at their 3'- and 5'-ends. These nucleotide
sequences serve as primer binding sites for the second
stage of PCR, and help to reduce amplification bias
between amplicons by normalizing primer hybridization

In the second stage of amplification, universal primers
corresponding to the nucleotide tag sequences amplify the
first stage PCR products to a detectable level. Restricting
the participation of the tag primers to the second stage of
PCR is a large difference (ca 10°C) in the annealing temperatures of the tag and locus-specific primers. The second
stage amplification products can be labelled at one or
both ends with specialised moieties, such as fluorescent
dyes and biotin, by use of 5'-modified tag primers. Use of
an excess of PCR cycles (exhaustive conditions) ensures
that the tag primers become fully incorporated into PCR
product to generate a similar yield of amplicons between
independent assays.
Amplification under standardised reaction conditions
A practical advantage of multiplex-ready PCR is the ability
to perform assays under standardised conditions. Conventional multiplex PCR typically requires that primer
sets are grouped according to their optimal annealing
temperature, and often other factors such as Mg2+ requirements. Published SSRs for many plant species have a wide
range of optimal annealing temperatures ranging from 45
to 60°C, which results primarily from the limited availability of DNA sequence from which primer sets can be
developed [22]. Differences in PCR requirements can

limit the potential to perform conventional multiplex
PCR for a given set of markers.
The ability to perform multiplex-ready PCR under standardised reaction conditions enables any combination of
markers to be deployed for multiplexed amplification,
and can improve assay throughput by facilitating PCR
automation. Standardised reaction conditions are
achieved by performing an initial optimisation step for
each primer set, in which the optimal concentration of
locus-specific primer for the amplification of the target
sequence is determined. Adjusting the locus-specific
primer concentration enables the PCR specificity and
yield of individual primer sets to be controlled, as it overcomes differences in the melting temperature and efficiency of polymerization of each primer set on genomic
template. These conditions also help to prevent undesirable amplification resulting from non-specific annealing of
the locus-specific primers during the first few PCR cycles.
While this initial optimisation step is time-consuming, in
our experience, this process is essentially the same as that
typically required for any new primer set to be used in
conventional PCR. Moreover, once determined, the optimal locus-specific primer concentration is used in multiplex-ready PCR, irrespective of whether uniplex or
multiplex assays are performed. This assay feature distinguishes multiplex-ready PCR from conventional multiplex PCR, where the primer concentration for each target
sequence is specifically optimised for each multiplex
assay.
Development of multiplex PCR assays
The routine development of multiplex PCR assays in both
animals and plants becomes more difficult as the level of
multiplexing increases due to the increased chance of
undesirable primer-primer interactions [16]. In plants,
this is compounded by large genome sizes, polyploidy
and limited marker choice. Higher multiplexing levels are
generally only achieved with careful assay optimisation
[23], reliance on commercially available and expensive
PCR reagents [24,25], or the use of a preamplification step
to first enrich the target sequences [26,27].

In the present study, a moderate success rate was achieved
for the routine development of multiplexed assays in
three plant genera with different genome sizes and ploidy.
This success rate is measurable in two ways. First, five or
more SSRs were amplified in 84, 87, 80 and 65% of the
six-plex PCRs tested in apricot, cherry, barley and bread
wheat, respectively. This success rate was achieved using
random sets of markers chosen only for six-plex PCR
because of non-overlapping allele sizes. In contrast, the
achievement of a similar level of multiplexing in plants
using conventional multiplex PCR is typically reported to
require extensive assay optimisation, arising from the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/80

requirement to adjust the primer concentration for individual markers in each reaction [14,15]. This optimisation
process is highly empirical and time consuming, and
depending on the combinations of markers may or may
not lead to successful assay development. And second,
multiplex-ready PCR was almost two times more successful (88% versus 48%) at amplifying sequence-tagged-sites
harbouring SNPs from barley in four-plex and six-plex
assays, compared to conventional multiplex PCR. As
expected from published literature, the multiplexing success of multiplex-ready PCR diminished with increasing
genome size and polyploidy, with the success rate highest
for apricot and cherry, followed by barley then bread
wheat (Table 1). Apricot and cherry have small diploid
genomes (ca. 300 Mbp) about twice the size of the Arabidopsis genome [28,29], barley has a large diploid genome
of about 5200 Mbp, and bread wheat has an allohexaploid genome of around 16,000 Mbp [30].
We believe that the improved amenability of multiplexready PCR for multiplexed amplification results from the
use of low concentrations of locus-specific primer, which
helps to reduce undesirable primer-primer interactions,
and an excess of PCR cycles to ensure that the locus-specific primer is completely incorporated into PCR product
at the end of the first stage of amplification. The latter
helps to ensure that a similar amount of PCR product is
amplified for each locus before the second stage of amplification. Similarly, the amplification of a relatively constant amount of PCR product between independent
reactions results from the use of an excess of PCR cycles in
the second stage of amplification to ensure that the tag
primer is fully incorporated into PCR product.
Advantages of multiplex-ready PCR for SSR genotyping
Fluorescence-based SSR detection and allele sizing on an
automated DNA fragment analyser is one of the fastest
and most accurate methods for SSR genotyping [31,32].
This procedure is based on the separation of fluorescently
labelled SSR amplicons by capillary or gel electrophoresis.
An advantage of fluorescence-based SSR genotyping is
that several SSRs can be simultaneously separated in a single capillary or gel lane providing that the SSR fragments
have non-overlapping allele sizes. In instances where SSR
allele sizes are overlapping, coseparation can be achieved
by labelling the SSR products with fluorescent dyes that
have different emission wavelengths. These advantages
facilitate genotyping throughput by providing compatibility with multiplex PCR and multi-pooling strategies,
the latter of which involves the pooling of individual PCR
assays for two or more SSRs prior to electrophoresis [33].

Highly paralleled SSR genotyping on an automated DNA
fragment analyser relies on the fluorescence intensities of
markers falling within a range that is optimal for accurate

Page 8 of 12

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:80

allele detection and automated allele sizing. Ideally, the
fluorescence intensity for each SSR should be relatively
uniform. This is especially important for the coseparation
of SSR markers with overlapping fragment sizes that are
labelled with different fluorophores. Large differences in
SSR fluorescence intensities can cause genotyping inaccuracies due to the inability of genotyping software to fully
correct for background fluorescence, which results from
the overlap of the emission spectra of different fluorophores. This phenomenon, known as "spectral bleed" and
"pull-up", results in the detection of a SSR allele where no
dye-labelled amplicon actually exists.
Multiplex-ready PCR provides several technological
advantages for highly paralleled, fluorescence-based SSR
genotyping. First, relatively uniform SSR amplification
within a multiplexed assay and between independent
reactions (Figure 2) enables the use of a standardised protocol to prepare SSR products for electrophoresis without
the risk of under- or over-loading the amount of PCR
product for individual markers. It also facilitates semiautomated allele scoring, since problems associated with
"pull up" are reduced. Secondly, the ability to dye label
SSR amplicons with a fluorophore of choice during PCR
amplification (see Figure 3) provides flexibility for the
separation of markers, since SSRs which cannot be multiplexed due to overlapping allele sizes can be coseparated
by labelling with different fluorophores and multi-pooling. These two advantages can improve genotyping
throughput and facilitate assay automation. A third
advantage is the substantial cost savings for fluorescent
primer labelling, since the synthesis of a specific fluorescently labelled primer for each SSR marker is not required.
Rather, multiplex-ready PCR requires only four dye
labelled primers to fully utilise the genotyping capabilities
of an ABI3730 DNA fragment analyser. In this sense, multiplex-ready PCR combines both the advantages of the
M13-tailed primer method and multiplex PCR for fluorescence-based SSR genotyping. The optimisation of more
than 2800 barley and bread wheat SSRs for multiplexready PCR, and its application for highly paralleled, fluorescence-based SSR genotyping is described elsewhere
[17,34].
Advantages of multiplex-ready PCR for SNP assays
A large number of assay chemistries and analysis platforms have been described for SNP genotyping [reviewed
by [5-7]]. In plants, the assay of SNPs usually consists of
two-steps: PCR amplification of a target sequence harbouring the polymorphism, followed by detection of the
SNP. Preamplication of the target sequence is generally
required due to the large size of plant genomes and polyploidy, which can cause poor sensitivity and specificity
when SNPs are assayed directly from genomic template
[7]. Preamplification adds significant cost to the assay of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/80

SNPs, often requires a purification step to remove unincorporated dNTP and primer, and can be a bottleneck for
high throughput genotyping when several SNPs distributed throughout the genome are assayed per sample.
Multiplex-ready PCR provides several advantages for the
multiplexed preparation of DNA templates for SNP detection and offers the potential to increase assay throughput
and reduce labour and consumable costs. The amplification of a similar amount of PCR product under standardised conditions for each target sequence within a
multiplexed assay, and between independent reactions,
provides similar advantages for assay automation to those
that can be captured for SSR genotyping. Similarly, the
ability to label the target sequences with specialised moieties such as biotin during PCR amplification facilitates
low cost compatibility with automated procedures that
can be used to purify and prepare the DNA templates for
SNP detection. Multiplex-ready PCR could also potentially be modified to provide compatibility with particular
types of SNP assay chemistries. For example, a T7 RNA
transcription site could be introduced into the nucleotide
sequence of one of the tag primers to allow the synthesis
of RNA from multiplex-ready PCR products using T7 RNA
polymerase to serve as template in the reverse transcription allele-specific primer extension assay described by
Pastinen et al. [35].

Conclusion
Multiplex-ready PCR is a method that simplifies the development of multiplexed PCR assays, and provides several
potential advantages for fluorescence-based SSR genotyping and the multiplexed preparation of DNA templates for
SNP detection assays. It differs from other published
methods for multiplex PCR in two ways. First, target DNA
sequences are amplified in two distinct stages that are separated by primer annealing temperature in a single-step,
closed-tube reaction. And second, assay development
requires only a single optimisation step to determine the
optimal concentration of locus-specific primer that is used
in all assays, irrespective of the level of multiplexing. Multiplex-ready PCR is broadly applicable to plant genomic
research and marker assisted breeding, and should be
transferable to any animal or plant species.

lines were Alexis, Chebec, Clipper, Flagship, Harrington,
Haruna Nijo, Sahara3771 and Sloop. The bread wheat
lines were Barunga, VPM Cook, Chinese Spring, Gabo,
Norin10, Olympic, Opata85 and WI7984 (a synthetic
hexaploid wheat).
Primer synthesis
Published primer sets for SSRs and sequence-tagged-sites
(STSs) harbouring SNPs were synthesised with generic
non-complementary nucleotide sequences at their 5'ends. Specifically, the forward and reverse primer for each
marker was synthesised with the nucleotide sequence 5'
ACGACGTTGTAAAA 3' and 5' CATTAAGTTCCCATTA 3',
respectively. Primer aliquots for each marker were prepared by mixing equimolar amounts of appropriate forward and reverse primers in 1× TE (1 mM EDTA, 10 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), and are hereafter referred to as locusspecific primers. Two generic tag primers, tagF and tagR,
with the sequences 5' ACGACGTTGTAAAA 3' and 5' CATTAAGTTCCCATTA 3', respectively, were also synthesised.
The tagF primer was labelled at its 5'-end with one of the
following fluorescent dyes: VIC, FAM, NED and PET
(Applied Biosystems).
Primer optimisation
The optimal concentration of locus-specific primer
required to amplify the target sequence was determined
empirically. Initially 20, 30, 40 and 80 nM of locus-specific primer was tested. PCR products were separated on a
GelScan2000 instrument (see SSR analysis section) or on
2% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. The optimal primer concentration was determined by visual
inspection as the strong amplification of a PCR fragment
of the expected size. In instances where it was desirable to
improve PCR specificity and yield, additional locus-specific primer concentrations were tested.
Multiplex-ready PCR assays
The amplification of published SSRs and sequences harbouring SNPs by uniplex and multiplex PCR was performed under identical reaction conditions. PCR was
performed in a 6 μl reaction mixture containing 0.2 mM
dNTP, 1× ImmoBuffer (Bioline) (16 mM (NH4)2SO2,
0.01% Tween-20, 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3), 1.5 mM
MgCl2, 100 ng/μl bovine serum albumin Fraction V
(Sigma Aldrich), 75 nmol each of dye-labelled tagF and
unlabeled tagR primer, 50 ng genomic DNA, 0.15 U
Immolase DNA polymerase (Bioline), and an appropriate
concentration of locus-specific primer (see Additional File
1). For multiplex PCR, locus-specific primers for several
markers were added to each reaction at the optimal concentration determined in uniplex assays. Due to limited
marker choice, some redundant use of primer sets amplifying SSRs and sequences harbouring SNPs was required
to construct the multiplex panels. Following an initial

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/80

denaturation step of 10 min at 95°C to heat activate the
DNA polymerase, PCR was performed for a total of 65
cycles with the profile: 30 s at 92°C, 90 s at 50°C, 60 s at
72°C for five cycles. The next 20 cycles were 30 s at 92°C,
90 s at 63°C, and 60 s at 72°C, followed by 40 cycles with
15 s at 92°C, 30 s at 54°C, and 60 s at 72°C, and a final
extension step of 10 min at 72°C. The purpose of the initial five cycles with 50°C annealing was to improve the
amplification efficiency of published primer sets with low
(< 50°C) annealing temperature. Preliminary studies
showed that the amplification yield of such primers could
be improved without significantly increasing the locusspecific primer concentration. The initial five cycles of
50°C annealing can be eliminated if only primer sets with
≥ 50°C annealing temperature are used.
Conventional PCR assays
The amplification of published SSRs and sequences harbouring SNPs by uniplex and multiplex PCR was performed under identical reaction conditions. PCR was
performed in a 6 μl reaction mixture containing 0.2 mM
dNTP, 1× Tfi PCR buffer (Invitrogen) (25 mM KCl, 75 mM
(NH4)2SO4, 1 mM DTT, proprietary stabilizers, 50 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 8.4), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 50 ng genomic DNA,
0.15 U Platinum Tfi DNA polymerase (Invitrogen), and
200 nmol each of standard length forward and reverse
primer (see Additional File 1). The forward primers of
published SSRs were labelled at their 5'-end with the fluorescent dye HEX (Applied Biosystems). For multiplex
PCR, each primer set was added at a concentration of 200
nmol. Following an initial denaturation step of 2 min at
94°C to heat activate the DNA polymerase, PCR was performed for a total of 50 cycles with the touchdown profile:
30 s at 92°C, 60 s at (Ta+10)°C, 60 s at 72°C, where Ta was
50, 55 or 60°C, depending on the optimal conditions
reported for the primer set. Following the first cycle, the
annealing temperature was reduced by 0.5°C for the next
20 cycles. The PCR was finished with a final extension step
of 10 min at 72°C.
SSR analysis
Electrophoresis and visualization of SSRs was performed
on a GelScan2000 (Corbett Research) and ABI3730 DNA
analyser (Applied Biosystems). For analysis on the
GelScan2000, PCR products were mixed with an equal
volume of gel loading buffer (98% formamide, 10 mM
EDTA and 0.5% basic fuchsin as tracking dye), heated for
3 min at 95°C, chilled quickly on ice and separated on a
4% sequencing gel [37]. For ABI3730 analysis, a standardized multi-pooling procedure was used to prepare SSR
products amplified by multiplex PCR for electrophoresis.
PCR products were diluted with five volumes of sterile
water, pooled together at a ratio of 2:2:1:2 for
VIC:FAM:NED:PET to give a final 20 μl volume, and
desalted by ultra-filtration using an AcroPrep 384 filter

plate with 10 kD Omega membrane according to the
manufacturer's instructions (PALL Life Sciences). The
desalted SSR products were resuspended in 25 μl of sterile
water. Three μl of the resuspended SSR product was added
to 8 μl of deionised formamide containing 0.8 μl of
GelScan500 LIZ size standard (Applied Biosystems). The
mixture was heated uncovered at 80°C for 5 minutes to
evaporate the water and electrophoresed according to the
manufacturer's instructions. This multi-pooling procedure resulted in 0.06 μl of each PCR product being electrophoresed. SSR allele sizing was performed using
GeneMapper v3.7 software (Applied Biosystems). The
pooling of PCR products with different dye-labels at the
2:2:1:2 ratio was to account for differences in the relative
fluorescence of each fluorophore.
SNP analysis
SNP assays were performed using allele-specific primer
extension chemistry and xMAP™ technology (Luminex
Corporation) on the BioPlex microsphere-based suspension array platform (BioRad). The assay was performed
essentially as described by [38] and involved: (a) an initial
PCR amplification of the target sequences harbouring the
SNPs from genomic template, (b) purification of the PCR
products to remove residual primer and dNTP, (c) assay of
the SNPs using allele-specific primers with oligonucleotide capture probes at their 5'-ends, and (d) detection of
the allele-specific primer extension products on the BioPlex instrument.

The multiplexed PCR products were diluted to 50 μl with
sterile water and purified by ultra-filtration to remove
excess PCR primer and dNTP using a Montage 384 PCR
cleanup plate (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. The purified PCR products were resuspended
in 20 μl of sterile water. Five μl of purified PCR product
was added to a PCR well and dried by heating at 80°C for
15 min before 5 μl of allele-specific primer extension mix
was added, which contained 1.25 μM each of dATP, dTTP,
dGTP and biotin-14-dCTP (Invitrogen), 1.25 mM MgCl2,
1 × Tsp PCR buffer, 0.1 U Platinum Tsp DNA polymerase
(Invitrogen), and 25 nmol of each allele-specific primer
(see Additional File 1). The thermocycling conditions
involved an initial denaturation step of 2 min at 94°C to
activate the DNA polymerase, followed by 30 cycles of 30s
at 94°C, 60s at 55°C, and 2 min at 74°C.
Following PCR, the allele-specific primer extension products were hybridised to fluorescently colour-coded carboxylated polystyrene LabMAP™ microspheres (Luminex
Corporation). Each allele-specific primer contained an
oligonucleotide sequence (ZipCode) at its 5'-end, allowing hybridization to a complementary sequence (called a
cZipCode) covalently attached to the microsphere surface.
The hybridization of the biotinylated allele-specific

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/80

primer extension products for each SNP to their corresponding microspheres was carried out essentially as
described by [39] in a 30 μl reaction volume containing
1× hybridization buffer (200 mM NaCl, 0.08% Triton X100, 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH8.0) and 500 microspheres of
each type. After initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 min and
incubation at 37°C for 30 min, the microspheres were
washed once with 100 μl of 1× hybridization buffer,
resuspended in 50 μl of 1× hybridization buffer and conjugated with streptavidin by adding 250 μg of streptavidin-conjugated R-phycoerythrin (Invitrogen). The
microspheres were incubated at room temperature for 15
min, washed once with 100 μl of 1× hybridization buffer,
resuspended in 50 μl of 1× hybridization buffer and
assayed on the BioPlex microsphere suspension array platform. The BioPlex instrument first identifies the specific
microsphere (and thus the SNP locus) based on the
microsphere colour then the presence or absence of the
streptavidin-biotin conjugate (indicative of the presence
or absence of the specific allele). The fluorescence on the
surface of the microspheres resulting from the streptavidin label was converted to a median fluorescence intensity
(MFI) value based on a minimum of 32 microspheres for
each of the SNP alleles assayed. The allele present at each
SNP locus was determined using BioPlex SNP Manager
software v1.0 (BioRad).
