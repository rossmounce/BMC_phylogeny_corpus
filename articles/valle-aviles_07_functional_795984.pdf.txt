Abstract
Background: Sporothrix schenckii is a pathogenic, dimorphic fungus, the etiological agent of
sporotrichosis, a subcutaneous lymphatic mycosis. Dimorphism in S. schenckii responds to second
messengers such as cAMP and calcium, suggesting the possible involvement of a calcium/calmodulin
kinase in its regulation. In this study we describe a novel calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein
kinase gene in S. schenckii, sscmk1, and the effects of inhibitors of calmodulin and calcium/calmodulin
kinases on the yeast to mycelium transition and the yeast cell cycle.
Results: Using the PCR homology approach a new member of the calcium/calmodulin kinase
family, SSCMK1, was identified in this fungus. The cDNA sequence of sscmk1 revealed an open
reading frame of 1,221 nucleotides encoding a 407 amino acid protein with a predicted molecular
weight of 45.6 kDa. The genomic sequence of sscmk1 revealed the same ORF interrupted by five
introns. Bioinformatic analyses of SSCMK1 showed that this protein had the distinctive features
that characterize a calcium/calmodulin protein kinase: a serine/threonine protein kinase domain
and a calmodulin-binding domain. When compared to homologues from seven species of
filamentous fungi, SSCMK1 showed substantial similarities, except for a large and highly variable
region that encompasses positions 330 – 380 of the multiple sequence alignment. Inhibition studies
using calmodulin inhibitor W-7, and calcium/calmodulin kinase inhibitors, KN-62 and lavendustin
C, were found to inhibit budding by cells induced to re-enter the yeast cell cycle and to favor the
yeast to mycelium transition.
Conclusion: This study constitutes the first evidence of the presence of a calcium/calmodulin
kinase-encoding gene in S. schenckii and its possible involvement as an effector of dimorphism in this
fungus. These results suggest that a calcium/calmodulin dependent signaling pathway could be
involved in the regulation of dimorphism in this fungus. The results suggest that the calcium/
calmodulin kinases of yeasts are evolutionarily distinct from those in filamentous fungi.

Background
Sporothrix schenckii, the etiologic agent of sporotrichosis, is
a dimorphic fungus that produces lymphocutaneous
lesions [1]. Pathogenic fungi use signal transduction pathways to rapidly adapt to changing environmental conditions. Studies on the molecular and cellular events during
the dimorphic transitions of S. schenckii suggested a role
for calcium ions in the control of proliferation and morphogenesis in this fungus [2]. Studies on the role of calcium metabolism during germ tube formation in S.
schenckii yeast cells showed that extracellular calcium ions
stimulate the yeast to mycelium transition and that two
calcium uptake peaks were detected in cells undergoing
transition from the yeast to mycelium forms [3]. The first
calcium uptake peak occurred during the first 30 min after
the induction of the yeast to mycelium transition. The second calcium uptake peak was observed 300 min after
induction, at the time of DNA synthesis. When different
substances that affected calcium uptake were added to the
medium during the yeast to mycelium transition such as
cobalt ions, ionophore A23187 and compound R24571,
germ tube formation was inhibited or occurred with
reduced kinetics [3].
Calcium is one of the most important intracellular second
messengers, it is involved in a wide range of cellular events
including secretion, motility, intermediary metabolism,
ion channel activity, and gene expression [4-8]. An
increase in intracellular calcium concentration results
from any of two events: the release of calcium from internal stores or the increased uptake from the extracellular
environment. Once the intracellular calcium concentration has increased, calcium exerts its role through a specific class of proteins known as calcium binding proteins.
One of the most of important of these proteins is calmodulin (CaM) [9,10]. Among the CaM interacting proteins
are the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases
(CaMKs) [11-14].
The members of the CaMK family are usually classified
based on their substrate specificity into two major groups.
The first group has a broad substrate specificity characterized by the ability to phosphorylate many different proteins and includes CaMKs I, II and IV. Within this group,
CaMKs I and IV are monomeric enzymes while CaMK II is
a multimeric enzyme. The second group is characterized
by narrow substrate specificity, and includes phosphorylase kinase, myosin light chain kinase and CaMK III (eEF2 Kinase) [15].
Calcium/calmodulin kinases are serine/threonine protein
kinases. They share many common structural features,
having two major domains: an amino-terminal catalytic
domain that is highly conserved, and a carboxy-terminal
regulatory domain. The regulatory domain consists of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/107

overlapping autoinhibitory and Ca2+/CaM binding
domains. The autoinhibitory domain acts as a pseudosubstrate, mimicking the substrate and interacting with the
catalytic domain, blocking access of the true substrate to
the catalytic site [15,16]. The Ca2+/CaM binding domain
is located in the C-terminal portion of the enzyme, consisting of approximately 20 amino acids. Upon binding of
Ca2+/calmodulin to a CaM-binding domain in the regulatory domain of the CaMK, a conformational change
ensues in which the autoinhibitory domain is removed
from the catalytic domain, exposing the active site of the
kinase and enabling binding of the substrate and its subsequent phosphorylation [10,15]. Activation of CaMK I
and IV is also regulated by phosphorylation by a CaM
kinase kinase (CaMKK) [16].
Within this group of multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin
kinases, the most studied has been the multimeric CaMK
II [12,15]. Very little has been published concerning
CaMK I [17]. This monomeric enzyme is primarily cytoplasmic in mammalian cells and those of many other
organisms [17]. Multiple isoforms of CaMK I have been
identified that have either cytoplasmic and/or nuclear
localization. A number of substrates have been identified
for CaMK I including synapsin I and II, the cystic fibrosis
transmembrane conductance regulator, myosin II regulatory light chain kinase, cAMP response element binding
protein (CREB), activating transcription factor (ATF-1),
histone deacetylases 4 and 5 and translation initiator factor eIF4GII [18].
The role of CaMKs in mammalian systems, particularly in
neurons is well established [11], while their occurrence
and function in fungi is not fully documented. Pausch and
colleagues cloned two Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases, CMK1 and CMK2, from Saccharomyces cerevisiae [19]. The cmk1 gene encodes a product of
approximately 55 kDa. Several functions of CaMKs in S.
cerevisiae include: survival of pheromone-induced growth
arrest, salt tolerance and thermotolerance [20]. Rasmussen reported the presence of a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase gene in the yeast Schizosaccharomyces
pombe, cmk1, with 40% similarity to the rat and human
CaMK-I [21]. In the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans, three calcium/calmodulin dependent protein
kinases, CMKA, CMKB, and CMKC, have been reported
[22-24]. CMKA and CMKB were identified as CaMKs
while CMKC was identified as a CaMKK. The disruption
of the CMKA and CMKB encoding genes was reported to
be lethal [25]. In another filamentous fungus, Neurospora
crassa, a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase
(CaMK-I) was reported by Yang and collaborators [26].
This protein was 71% similar to Ca2+/calmodulin dependent protein kinase A of A. nidulans and 53% similar to
CaMK-II of S. cerevisiae. Tsai, Tu and Chen described a

Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase gene in the
filamentous fungus, Arthrobotrys dactyloides [27]. This gene
encoded a protein with significant homology to mammalian CaMKs. Whole genome sequencing projects show the
presence of hypothetical proteins homologous to CaMK
in other fungi, such as Magnaporthe grisea and Gibberella
zeae although the formal identification of these proteins
has not been reported in the scientific literature.
Even though the importance of calcium signaling in the
control of dimorphism in S. schenckii is well documented,
the presence of key enzymes involved in calcium signaling
in this fungus have not been described [2,3]. The experimental objectives of this work were to establish the presence of a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase gene
in S. schenckii using a PCR homology approach and the
characterization of the role of the encoded kinase in S.
schenckii dimorphism. We present details of the identification and sequencing of the sscmk1 gene, gene organization, including the presence and position of introns, and
conserved polypeptide-encoded domains. We establish
the relationship of this gene to those of other filamentous
fungi using bioinformatics and phylogenetic analyses and
present evidence for the existence of a well-defined group
of CaM kinases in the filamentous fungi. We establish the
expression of this gene in the yeast and mycelium forms
of S. schenckii. We also inquire into the effects of compound W-7, a calmodulin inhibitor, and KN-62 and lavendustin C, CaMK inhibitors, on the yeast to mycelium
transition and the yeast cell cycle in S. schenckii. This work
constitutes the first direct evidence of the presence of a
CaMK encoding gene in S. schenckii and its possible
involvement on dimorphism in this fungus. These results
suggest that a calcium/calmodulin dependent signaling
pathway could be involved in the regulation of dimorphism in this fungus and will ultimately help us elucidate
the calcium dependent signal transduction pathways in S.
schenckii.

Results
In this study we describe a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase gene in S. schenckii, sscmk1, and the
effects of inhibitors of calmodulin and calcium/calmodulin kinases on the yeast to mycelium transition and the
yeast cell cycle.
Identification and characterization of the sscmk1 gene
The PCR homology approach was used to identify the
presence of a calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase gene
in S. schenckii DNA with primers based on conserved
motifs of the camk-1 gene of N. crassa [26]. Several sets of
primers were tested. A 363 bp PCR product was obtained
using S. schenckii DNA as template with an upper primer
comprising nucleotides 352 to 369 and as lower primer
the antisense sequence included between nucleotides 610

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/107

to 627 in the coding region of the N. crassa camk-1 gene.
This PCR product contained 275 bp of coding sequence
and 88 bp of a putative intron sequence, and included the
sequence from nucleotides 653 to 1016 (5'->3') of the S.
schenckii Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase genomic
sequence. The derived amino acid sequence of this PCR
product was found to be 91% identical to the corresponding region of the N. crassa camk-1. This PCR product was
the first evidence of the presence of a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase gene in S. schenckii and was
named sscmk1.
Based on the sequence of the original 363 bp PCR product, gene-specific primers and nested gene-specific primers were designed for RACE as described in Methods. The
5' and 3' ends of the sscmk1 gene were obtained from two
different RACE reactions each.
PCR reactions were performed to confirm both the
genomic and cDNA sequences of the sscmk1 gene. The
genomic DNA PCR product was 1839 bp, showing the
presence of an open reading frame (ORF) of 1221 bp
interrupted by five introns (Figure 1). The coding
sequence in this PCR product confirmed the one obtained
using the RACE technique. The introns had the consensus
intron/exon junction splice site, 5'GT/3'AG. The position
of the introns in the sscmk1 genomic sequence were the
following: the first intron had 136 bp and included nucleotides 20 to 155 (5'->3'); the second intron had 71 bp and
included nucleotides 208 to 278 (5'->3'); the third intron
had 82 bp and included nucleotides 487 to 568 (5'->3');
the fourth intron had 88 bp and included nucleotides 726
to 813 (5'->3') and the fifth intron had 64 bp and
included nucleotides 1200 to 1263 (5'->3') (Figure 1).
The position of the introns in sscmk1 was conserved when
compared to those of the introns in the camk-1 gene of N.
crassa, although the length and the nucleotide sequence of
the respective introns were not the same. The first and
fourth introns are phase 1 introns and were found interrupting codons encoding F3 and D142, respectively. The
second intron was a phase 2 intron and was found interrupting the codon that encoded K20. The third and fifth
introns in sscmk1 are phase 0 introns, interrupting the
coding region between the codons encoding R89 and
D90, G270 and D271, respectively.
The cDNA coding sequence was obtained using S.
schenckii yeast cDNA as template. A PCR product of 1790
bp was obtained, containing a 1221 bp coding sequence,
378 nucleotides of the 5' UTR and 162 nucleotides of 3'
UTR after the termination codon prior to the poly A+ tail.
The coding sequence was exactly the same as the previous
sequence obtained using genomic DNA as template,
except for the absence of the intron sequences (Figure 1).

Genomic and derived amino acid sequences of the S. schenckii sscmk1 gene
Genomic and derived amino acid sequences of the S. schenckii sscmk1 gene. The nucleotide sequence of the sscmk1 gene is shown. Non-coding
regions are given in lower case letters, coding regions and amino acids are given in upper case letters. The derived amino acid sequence shows a protein of
407 amino acids. The invariant amino acids required by serine/threonine protein kinases are shaded in red. The potential autophosphorylation sites containing the consensus sequence {R, K}-X-X-{T, S} are shaded in light blue. The calmodulin-binding domain is shaded in gray.

In order to determine if this sscmk1 gene was transcribed
in the mycelium form of the fungus, total RNA from the
mycelium and yeast forms of the fungus were used to synthesize cDNA that was used as template for RT-PCR reactions with the DASQTI/WSMGVI primer combination.
This set of primers amplified the same region obtained in
the original 363 bp PCR product without the intron
sequence of 88 bp. Figure 2, shows the expected PCR
product of 279 bp obtained when using yeast and mycelium cDNA as template demonstrating the presence of
the sscmk1 gene transcript in both forms of the fungus.
Bioinformatic sequence characterization
Figure 3 shows the 5' UTR of the cDNA sequence that was
analyzed using MatInspector [28] with 85% as threshold,
and identified the presence of a TATA box at position -43.

The position of this TATA box is within the region we
would expect to find it (between -25 to -100) in reference
to the initial methionine. The presence of two CCAAT
boxes at -5 and -242 was also observed. A putative CRE
biding site was observed at -309. It is of interest to note
that CaMKs in many systems are responsible, together
with cAMP for the activation of the transcription factor
that binds to CRE [29], if this applies to our CaMK, it
could be modulating its own transcription by this mechanism.
Figure 1 shows the derived amino acid sequence of
sscmk1, a protein of 407 amino acids with a calculated
molecular weight of 45.6 kDa. Protein domain analysis of
SSCMK1 using the online ScanProsite motif search tool
[30] and Pfam [31], identified the presence of a protein

CaMK. The 12 highly conserved regions referred to as subdomains characteristic of protein kinases by Hanks and
collaborators [32,33] and the calcium/calmodulin binding domain are also present in this protein.
Using the PANTHER Classification System the sscmk1
gene was classified as a member of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent
protein
kinase
subfamily
(PTHR22982:SF29) (residues 67–342) with an E-value of
1.8 × e-187 indicating a very likely correct functional assignment [34]. According to the PANTHER ontologies, the
molecular function is that of a non-receptor serine/threonine protein kinase and sscmk1 is involved in molecular

The putative CaM-binding domain was also identified in
SSCMK1 using the Calmodulin Target Database [35]. The
Calmodulin Target Database search identified the presence of a 1-5-8-14 CaM-binding motif at residues 298 to
317, (KARLRRGIELVKLTNRIEAL).
Further analysis of the sscmk1 gene encoded product
showed a pak-box/p21-rho-binding domain. The Pfam
search identified Rho binding repeats at amino acids
97–150 and 185–234 with e values of 1.6e-06 and 4.9e-07,
respectively.
Figure 4 shows a multiple sequence alignment of the
derived amino acid sequence of sscmk1 to seven other calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases from filamentous fungi. These results show a high degree of
conservation among these proteins specifically at the
kinase domain. We calculated pairwise identities based on
the alignment and found that sequence identity goes from
59% to 74% in these homologues (data not shown).
There is substantial variability at the carboxy-terminal of
these proteins, which can be seen after the camodulinbinding domain, between positions 330 and 420 of the
alignment. All the required conserved residues and
domains can be seen in this alignment.
Phylogenetic analysis
Figure 5 shows the rooted consensus phylogenetic gene
tree resulting from the analysis of several CaMKs from
fungi using human CaMK1D as an outgroup. The human
CaMK1D was chosen based on the results of a BLAST
search giving the highest similarity and significance
among the human CaMK1s. This analysis identified the S.

Discussion
In this study we describe a calcium/calmodulin kinase
gene in S. schenckii, sscmk1, and the effects of inhibitors of
the encoded protein on the yeast to mycelium transition
and the yeast cell cycle. CaM kinases have been extensively
recognized as important regulators of morphogenesis and
differentiation in many different cell types [11,12]. The
present study was conducted in order to establish the presence of this important gene in S. schenckii and the potential involvement of CaMK on the control of the

The CaM kinase encoded by the sscmk1 gene in S. schenckii
is homologous to members of the CaMK group in such
diverse organisms as Homo sapiens, Xenopus, Drosophila
and definitely fungi as shown in Figure 4 and 5. Our
sequence and phylogenetic analyses show a very high
degree of conservation of this protein in fungi. In particular, that the CaMKs of the yeast and the filamentous fungi
show distinct monophyletic groups.
The derived amino acids sequence of the sscmk1 gene
encodes a protein of 407 amino acids. The number of
amino acid residues present in this protein is within the
range of other fungal CaMKs, such as: 415 amino acids in
N. crassa, 409 amino acids in A. nidulans and 406 amino
acids in M. grisea. The calculated molecular weight of the
protein encoded by the sscmk1 gene product was determined to be 45.6 kDa. This value is also in the range
observed for other CaMKs in fungi, such as: 46.7 kDa in
N. crassa, 45.6 kDa in M. grisea and 46.9 kDa in A. nidulans.
The analysis of the derived amino acid sequence revealed
a calcium/calmodulin kinase containing all the 12 conserved subdomains necessary for a functional serine/threonine protein kinase [32,33], and identified a serine/
threonine protein kinase catalytic domain. The nine
amino acids shown to be strictly conserved in the catalytic

BMC Microbiology 2007, 7:107

domain of protein kinases were found in the corresponding region of SSCMK1. An additional five residues also
conserved in all protein kinases were found in the corresponding region of SSCMK1. All these residues are highlighted in red in Figure 1. The PANTHER protein and gene
classification system showed an extremely significant
expectation value for sscmk1 being a calcium/calmodulindependent protein kinase [34].
A putative CaM-binding domain (highlighted in gray in
Figure 1) was also identified in SSCMK1 using the Calmodulin Target Database search [35]. The CaM-binding
domain is characterized by a high proportion of basic
amino acid residues, not highly conserved at the level of
primary structure, but conserved at the level of secondary
structure [44]. This motif is of the same type as that found
in CaM kinases of A. nidulans and S. cerevisiae, among others.
In addition to the serine protein kinase domain, the
sscmk1 gene encoded product showed a pak-box/p21-rhobinding domain. The Rho, Rac and CDC42 are small
GTPases that are involved in a variety of different fuctions
such as bud emergence, actin polymerization, differentiation, protein transport and many other cellular events
[45-47]. Many kinases have been shown to contain this
motif and it has been reported that these protein kinases
might be stimulated by the small GTPases [48]. Proteins
with this domain are usually involved in the regulation of
the MAPK pathway and this cascade has important relevance in the control of morphogenetic and proliferative
processes.
Due to the fact that S. schenckii is not a genetically manageable organism, our approach to the study of the
involvement of CaMK activity in dimorphism was based
on the use of substances that affect CaMK activity. It is of
interest to note that we used three different compounds
W-7, KN-62 and lavendustin C, that will inhibit the CaMK
pathway with different mechanism of action in order to
lessen the uncertainties of using inhibitors that have different degrees of specificity towards CaMKs. KN-62 is the
most specific inhibitor of the three, inhibiting the CaM
binding site in CaMKs [49]. Lavendustin C is preferentially a CaMK inhibitor but has been reported to also
inhibit tyrosine kinases [43]. Compound W-7 would be
expected to inhibit CaMK and other CaM dependent proteins because it is a calmodulin inhibitor [40]. Even
though there might be some considerations in terms of
the specificity of these last two compounds, W-7 and lavendustin C, we have used KN-62 which is considered a
very specific inhibitor of CaMKs.
Given the above, it is most important to note that the final
outcomes in the presence of these inhibitors observed by

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/107

us were the same regardless of the inhibitor used: 1) stimulation of the yeast to mycelium transition, and 2) inhibition of the re-entry into the yeast cell cycle. Nevertheless
we have to keep in mind that the full scope of the processes inhibited by W-7 and lavendustin C are not presently known.
The inhibition observed on yeast cells induced to re-enter
the budding cycle suggests that CaM and/or CaM kinase
activity are required for the re-entry of yeast cells into this
cycle. The controls had 50% budding cells after 9 h of
incubation while those in the presence of W-7, KN-62 or
lavendustin C had only 30, 28 and 38%, respectively. At 9
h of incubation the control cells undergo DNA synthesis
and bud formation that results in cell duplication after 12
h of incubation [50]. The inhibition was observed at 9 h
of incubation, specifically at the time of the G1/S transition. S. schenckii yeast cells will not form buds if DNA synthesis is inhibited [50]. We therefore believe that CaM
kinase activity is probably needed for the G1/S transition
during the budding cycle as has been reported for other
systems as well [51].
On the other hand, these inhibitors stimulated the yeast
to mycelium transition at 6 and 9 h of incubation. It is at
6 h after inoculation that control cells induced to transform to the mycelium form of the fungus first show germ
tubes, after they have undergone DNA synthesis and the
first nuclear division, a prerequisite for germ tube formation in this fungus [52]. It is not until 12 h after inoculation that all control cells exhibit germ tubes. The process
of germ tube formation in the presence of KN-62 and lavendustin C occurred with increased kinetics, and germination was well advanced at 9 h after inoculation.
Compound W-7 was observed to increase germ tube formation significantly only at 9 h after inoculation.
Two mechanisms have been postulated for the effects of
CaM and CaM kinases in many systems including fungi,
one suggests that these enzymes have an effect in the control of the cell cycle [51,53] and the other suggests that
they have an important role in differentiation and gene
expression, specifically through the activation of transcription factors [53-55]. At this moment we do not have
the exact mechanism by which CaM and/or CaM kinase
act in S. schenckii. A unified theory on how CaM kinases
operate in fungi is presently not available, primarily
because the targets of these enzymes are not known and
contradictory results have been reported in fungi where
the activity of these enzymes have been studied. In A. nidulans, CaMK is an essential gene, required for cell cycle
progression [56,57]. In this fungus, knocking out the
CaMK gene has been reported to be lethal and overexpression of the gene has been reported to be inhibitory
of spore germination and growth in this fungus [56,57].

BMC Microbiology 2007, 7:107

In S. cerevisiae, CaMK and calcineurin are not required for
cell proliferation, nevertheless, they are required for survival of pheromone-induced growth arrest and for ion
homeostasis [20]. In C. albicans CaM inhibitors were
observed to suppress hyphae formation [58] while in
Paracocciodiodis brasiliensis, CaM inhibitors were reported
to inhibit the mycelium to yeast transition [59]. These
results show that the role of CaMKs differ among fungal
species.
Our results using CaMK inhibitors suggest that this
enzyme is needed for proliferation of the yeast cells when
induced to re-enter the cell cycle and is needed for the
maintenance of the yeast morphology in S. schenckii. We
could hypothesize that CaM kinase is needed for the
phosphorylation of proteins involved in the regulation of
the cell cycle and also for the phosphorylation and inactivation of transcription factors needed for the transition to
the mycelium form of the fungus, as has been postulated
for A. nidulans [53]. Nevertheless, the final interpretation
of these results and those of the yeast to mycelium transition await the identification of the interacting partners of
CaM and CaM kinases in this fungus.

Conclusion
The information summarized in this work shows once
more the complexity of the involvement of protein
kinases, regulated by intracellular levels of calcium ions in
the control of dimorphism in S. schenckii. In this work a
calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase gene,
sscmk1, was identified and characterized. Messenger RNA
for this gene was detected in both yeast and mycelium
forms of S. schenckii. We had previously identified a role
for protein kinase C in the regulation of dimorphism in S.
schenckii but had not identified either the presence or the
role of CaMKs in this fungus. Calcium/calmodulin
kinases are known to be effectors of the calcium signal in
other systems but no information as to the existence and
nature of these enzymes was available in S. schenckii until
now.
The cDNA sequence of the sscmk1 gene revealed an ORF of
1221 bp with the predicted amino acid sequence containing all the consensus domains present in other serine/
threonine protein kinases as well as a putative CaM-binding domain. The genomic sequence had five introns,
whose positions are conserved in the other fungal calcium/calmodulin kinases.
The encoded protein has 407 amino acids and a molecular weight of approximately 45.6 kDa. Protein domain
analysis of SSCMK1 identified the presence of a serine/
threonine catalytic domain, protein kinase ATP binding
region, a serine/threonine protein kinase active site, and a
calmodulin binding site.

Most important of all, CaM and CaMK inhibitors were
found to favor the yeast to mycelium transition and to
inhibit the re-entry into the budding cycle by yeast cells in
S. schenckii suggesting a role for calmodulin kinase in the
expression of the yeast morphology of the fungus.

Methods
Strain
S. schenckii (ATCC 58251) was used for all experiments.
Cultures of the mycelial and the yeast forms of this fungus
were obtained as previously described [60].
Nucleic acids isolation
DNA and RNA were obtained from S. schenckii yeast cells
as described previously [60] using the methods of Sherman [61] and Chomczynski & Sacchi [62], respectively.
Mycelium form RNA was obtained as previously
described [60]. Poly A+ RNA was obtained from total RNA
using the mRNA Purification Kit from Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ, USA) and used as template for
cDNA synthesis using the RETROscript® First-Strand Synthesis Kit for RT-PCR from Ambion Corp., (Austin, TX,
USA).
Polymerase Chain Reaction
S. schenckii DNA (100 ng) was used as template for
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers (100–200
ng) targeted to conserved motifs in the N. crassa camk-I
gene (upper primer: 5' gatgcttcccagaccatc 3'; lower primer:
5' tatgacacccattgacca 3'). The Ready-to-Go™ PCR Beads
(Amersham Biosciences) were used for PCR. PCR was performed using a Perkin Elmer GeneAmp PCR System 2400
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The amplification parameters were as follows: an initial denaturation
at 94°C for 30 sec, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation
step at 94°C for 30 sec, annealing at 40–55°C (depending
on the primer combination) for 1 min, and extension at
72°C for 2 min.

PCR products were analyzed on agarose gels and the DNA
recovered using Spin-X Centrifuge Tube Filters as
described by the manufacturer (0.22 μm, Corning Costar
Corp., Corning, NJ, USA). The TOPO TA Cloning System
(Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used for cloning PCR products and One shot™ E. coli (TOPO 10) competent cells were transformed with the ligated products.
Plasmid preparations were obtained using the Fast Plasmid TM Mini technology from Eppendorf (Brinkmann
Instruments, Inc. Westbury, NY, USA).
Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)
The 5' and 3' ends of the S. schenckii sscmk1 gene were
obtained using the SMART RACE Kit (BD Biosciences
Clontech, Palo Alto CA, USA). Primers for RACE were
designed based on the sequence obtained previously. The

3'GSP2-2, 5' ttccgttccgaaaacctgcccgacctga 3'; 3'NGSP2-1,
5' aagcagtctgactccgacttggttttgg 3'; 3'NGSP2-2, 5' tgccactgaccacaacttgctgccagag 3'. All RACE reactions were carried
out in the Perkin Elmer GeneAmp PCR System 2400
(Applied Biosystems). The touchdown PCR and nested
PCR parameters were the same as those used previously
[60].
cDNA and genomic sequence
In order to obtain the complete cDNA coding sequence
for sscmk1, PCR was performed using cDNA as template
(100 ng) and the sscmk1 forward primer 1 (5' ccccattcaccctctccc 3') and sscmk1 reverse primer 1 (5' ccacaagagcaaacagcc 3'). To obtain the genomic sequence, PCR was
performed using DNA as template and the sscmk1 forward
primer 2 (5' accaactccaatatgagc 3') and sscmk1 reverse
primer 1 above. The PCR products containing the entire
coding sequence, from both the cDNA and genomic templates were cloned and sequenced.
DNA sequencing and analysis
All sequencing reactions were conducted using the ABI
PRISM™ 377 automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems) and the Thermo Sequenase II Dye terminator Cycle
Sequencing Premix Kit (Amersham Biosciences) as
described previously [60].
Bioinformatics Sequence and Phylogenetic Analysis
The theoretical molecular weight was calculated using the
online ExPASy tools [63]. The partial 5' UTR nucleotide
sequence of sscmk1 obtained by RACE was analyzed for
transcription factor binding sites using online MatInspector [28]. On-line ScanProsite search [30] and Pfam [31]
were used to identify potential motifs present in SSCMK1.
The calmodulin-binding domain was identified using the
on line Calmodulin Target Database [35]. The protein
classification was performed using the PANTHER Gene
and Protein Classification System [34].

On-line database searches and comparisons were performed with the BLAST algorithm [64] with a cutoff of 107, a low complexity filter and the BLOSUM 62 matrix. A
multiple sequence alignment was built using MCOFFEE
[65]. The alignment was visualized using the program
GeneDoc [66]. The alignment was analyzed for conservation using the program G-blocks [67] and trimmed as sug-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/107

gested by this software. The trimmed alignment was used
to build a phylogenetic tree using the PHYLIP suite of programs [68] with 1000 bootstrap replicates, using the
neighbor-joining algorithm and an extended majority
rule for consensus.
The multiple sequence alignment and the phylogenetic
tree for CaMKs were constructed using the following
sequences of either CaMK or hypothetical proteins
homologous to CaMKs: Coccidiodes immitis (GenBank:
EAS33607.1);Emericella
nidulans
(GenBank:
AAB97502.1); Gibberella zeae (GenBank: EAA76718.1);
Kluyveromyces lactis (GenBank: CAG98820.1); Magnaporthe grisea (GenBank: XP_365067.1); Metarhizium
anisopliae (GenBank: AAB80685.1); Neurospora crassa
(GenBank: AAL14118.1); Phaeosphaeria nodorum (GenBank: ABD59786.1); Yarrowia lipolytica (GenBank:
CAG80077.1); Saccharomyces cerevisiae (GenBank:
CAA40928.1) and Homo sapiens CaMK1D (GenBank:
AAH35745.1). The GenBank accession numbers for the S.
schenckii calcium/calmodulin kinase are the following:
mRNA, AY823267; genomic sequence, AY823266; and
derived amino acid sequence, AAV80434.
Inhibitor studies during the yeast to mycelium transition
and the yeast cell cycle
In order to evaluate the involvement of CaM and CaMK in
the control of dimorphism in S. schenckii, inhibitors were
added to the medium where synchronized yeast cells were
induced to undergo transition to the mycelium form or reenter the budding cycle. The following substances were
tested for their effects on the yeast to mycelium transition
and the yeast cell cycle: compound W-7, [N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalene-sulfonamide] (100 μM)
[38], KN-62, 1- [N,O-bis(1,5-isoquinoline-sulfonyl)-Nmetyl-1-tyrosyl]-4-piperazine (10 μM) [41] and lavendustin C (10 μM) [43] (Calbiochem, EMD Biosciences Inc.).

The yeast form of the fungus was obtained from conidia
as described previously [52]. Unbudded yeast cells were
synchronized by selection of unbudded cells by filtration
[52]. These cells were induced to form germ tubes in the
presence and absence of effectors of CaM and CaM kinase
activity in a basal medium with glucose at pH 4.0 [52].
Parallel cultures were inoculated and, at 6 and 9 h after
inoculation, the content of a flask was filtered for the
determination of the percentage of cells with germ tubes
for each of the substances tested. These same yeast cells
were induced to re-enter the yeast cell cycle as described
previously in the presence and absence of effectors of CaM
or CaM kinases in a basal medium with glucose at pH 7.2
[50]. Yeast cells were inoculated as described previously
[50] and at 6 and 9 h after inoculation samples were taken
and the percentage of budding cells was recorded.

The results are expressed as the average percentage of cells
with germ tubes or buds at 6 and 9 h of incubation ± one
standard deviation of at least three independent determinations. The Student t test was used to determine the statistical significance of the data. A 95% confidence level
was used to determine statistical significance.
