Abstract
Background: Clostridial neurotoxins (CNTs) are the most deadly toxins known and causal agents
of botulism and tetanus neuroparalytic diseases. Despite considerable progress in understanding
CNT structure and function, the evolutionary origins of CNTs remain a mystery as they are unique
to Clostridium and possess a sequence and structural architecture distinct from other protein
families. Uncovering the origins of CNTs would be a significant contribution to our understanding
of how pathogens evolve and generate novel toxin families.
Results: The C. botulinum strain A genome was examined for potential homologues of CNTs. A
key link was identified between the neurotoxin and the flagellin gene (CBO0798) located
immediately upstream of the BoNT/A neurotoxin gene cluster. This flagellin sequence displayed the
strongest sequence similarity to the neurotoxin and NTNH homologue out of all proteins encoded
within C. botulinum strain A. The CBO0798 gene contains a unique hypervariable region, which in
closely related flagellins encodes a collagenase-like domain. Remarkably, these collagenasecontaining flagellins were found to possess the characteristic HEXXH zinc-protease motif
responsible for the neurotoxin's endopeptidase activity. Additional links to collagenase-related
sequences and functions were detected by further analysis of CNTs and surrounding genes,
including sequence similarities to collagen-adhesion domains and collagenases. Furthermore, the
neurotoxin's HCRn domain was found to exhibit both structural and sequence similarity to
eukaryotic collagen jelly-roll domains.
Conclusion: Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the neurotoxin and adjacent genes evolved
from an ancestral collagenase-like gene cluster, linking CNTs to another major family of clostridial
proteolytic toxins. Duplication, reshuffling and assembly of neighboring genes within the BoNT/A
neurotoxin gene cluster may have lead to the neurotoxin's unique architecture. This work provides
new insights into the evolution of C. botulinum neurotoxins and the evolutionary mechanisms
underlying the origins of virulent genes.

Background
Clostridial neurotoxins (CNTs) are the most poisonous
biological toxins known and molecular agents of botulism and tetanus neuroparalytic diseases [1]. Due to their
extreme toxicity and potential threat as bioterrorism
agents, they are listed as Category A agents by the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention along with other
deadly agents such as anthrax. Elucidating the mechanisms by which CNTs evolved is therefore of significant
importance to our understanding of pathogen evolution
and emerging diseases.
While considerable progress has been made in understanding CNT structure and function [2-9], like many toxins and virulence factors, the evolutionary origins of CNTs
are unclear. CNTs are produced by four phylogenetically
distinct groups (I-IV) of C. botulinum, and also by strains
of C. tetani, C. baratii, and C. butyricum [10]. As demonstrated by the scattered phyletic distribution of neurotoxin-producing clostridia [10] and the patterns of
sequence similarity between different neurotoxin gene
clusters [11], CNT genes appear to have undergone significant lateral transfer between different species of Clostridium. The occurrence of lateral transfer is also supported by
the discovery of plasmid-encoded neurotoxin genes in
numerous C. botulinum strains [12], as well as the existence of putative insertion sequences flanking the neurotoxin gene cluster [13].
While CNTs have undergone frequent lateral transfer
between species of Clostridium, no CNT homologues have
been identified outside of the Clostridium genus. CNTs
form an isolated protein family according to SCOP [14]
and PFAM [15] and have a unique structural architecture
that complicates the identification of related proteins and
potential ancestors. While CNT domains have little detectable sequence similarity to proteins outside of the CNT
family, there are however some structural and functional
similarities to other domain families. The beta-trefoil, a
three-fold symmetrical structure that forms the C-terminal
receptor binding domain (HCRc) and associated hemagglutinin components, is common to interleukins, ricinlike lectins, and fibroblast growth factors [16]. The adjacent HCRn domain, also involved in receptor binding,
forms a jelly-roll like structure similar to laminin globular
G domains [4]. The central translocase adopts a long
alpha-helical structure containing alpha-helical bundles
that resemble those found in translocase-like domains of
other toxins [17]. Lastly, the N-terminal catalytic domain
has been grouped under the zincin-like group of metalloproteases by SCOP and under the Peptidase MA clan by
the MEROPS database [18]. It contains a HEXXH zincbinding motif found in other zinc endopeptidases, but
has only weak structural similarity to other members of
the Peptidase MA clan [5].

Diversity of domain and fold composition and extreme
sequence divergence are common features of bacterial toxins [19]. Rapid sequence evolution in toxin genes is
largely a consequence of the evolutionary 'arms race'
between pathogen and host [19]. Therefore, it is important to consider that evolutionarily related toxins may
only share weak sequence similarity and may have undergone considerable structural rearrangements. Here, we
present evidence supporting the hypothesis that CNTs
were formed within an ancestral Clostridium species by
duplications and rearrangements of neighboring genes
within the neurotoxin gene cluster, and identify the likely
evolutionary precursors of CNTs and surrounding genes.
Multiple links to collagenase-related sequences and functions are detected through an analysis of the nearby flagellin and hemagglutinin genes (strain A) in addition to
the CNT domains. The detected links provide novel
insights into the evolutionary origins and ancestral function of the neurotoxin gene cluster.

Results and Discussion
Ancient gene duplications within the BoNT/A neurotoxin
gene cluster
A comprehensive analysis of pairwise sequence similarities was performed for all proteins encoded within the C.
botulinum (strain Hall A, ATCC 3502) genome [20], in an
attempt to identify distant homologues of CNTs and possible sequence remnants of the evolutionary process by
which CNTs originated. This initial analysis was limited to
a single genome for a more sensitive detection of pairwise
homologies using a restricted database, however subsequent searches were also performed using all available
clostridial genomes. For the 3615 proteins encoded
within C. botulinum (strain Hall A, ATCC 3502) [20], a
'heat map' of pairwise sequence similarity was constructed
(see Methods) (Figure 1). For each pairwise alignment,
the E-value and percentile rank relative to all other pairwise alignments was calculated using SSEARCH [21].
When compared by percentile rank, the neurotoxin gene
cluster stood out as a "hot spot" of local pairwise sequence
similarities. The neurotoxin gene cluster can be seen as a
distinct cluster of high-scoring pairs in the centre of the
heat map region in Figure 1A. Based on both the percentile ranks and E-values for the pairwise alignments corresponding to these genes (Figure 1B), there are clear
sequence similarities between multiple sequences within
this region, including BoNT/A, non-toxic non-hemagglutinin (NTNH), the adjacent hemagglutinin (HA) components and the adjacent CBO0798 gene encoding a
flagellin protein (NCBI accession YP_001253335). BoNT/
A and NTNH produced the top-scoring alignments with
each other out of 3615 proteins in C. botulinum strain A (E
= 1e-22, 9e-24), an expected result given previously identified sequence similarities between BoNTs and NTNH
[22] as well as their virtually identical domain architecture

as identified by the NCBI's conserved domain database
annotation (e.g., for NCBI IDs ABP48106 and
BAA90660). Surprisingly, the next highest match in both
cases corresponds to the CBO0798 flagellin gene located
immediately upstream of the neurotoxin gene cluster (Figure 2A). The associated E-values were 0.041 and 0.42 for
BoNT/A and NTNH, respectively (Figure 1B). CBO0798
aligned with NTNH and BONT/A in two different CNT
regions (I and II) (Figure 2B, Additional Files 1, 2). Additional searches using the sequences of CNTs from other
strains also identified CBO0798 as the most consistent
top ranked hit out of all C. botulinum strain A proteins
with sequence identities between CNTs and CBO0798
ranging from 20–24%, and the strongest alignments
involving region II of CNTs (Additional File 1).
In addition to the detected similarities between
CBO0798-BoNT/A and NTNH-BoNT/A, sequence similarities were also detected between the beta-trefoil hemagglutinin components (HA33 and HA17). HA33 and HA17
were identified as reciprocal top ranked matches (E =
0.041, 0.2), and a weak similarity was detected between
HA33 and the C-terminal (beta-trefoil) regions of NTNH

(ranked 10th, E = 2.4). Sequence similarity was also found
between the hemagglutinin components HA70 and residues 39–474 of NTNH (ranked #2 out of all pairwise
alignments with HA70 as the query, E = 0.72). Though the
E-values calculated above are not all statistically significant, the high-ranking scores relative to the 3615 C. botulinum proteins suggest that multiple genes within the
BoNT/A neurotoxin gene cluster are likely distant homologues that have undergone extensive sequence divergence.
Sequence similarity to the upstream flagellin gene
To identify other clostridial sequences homologous to
CBO0798, a PSI-BLAST [23] search was conducted starting with the CBO0798 sequence (default parameters,
results restricted to Clostridia). All homologues identified
in the first iteration were members of the flagellin family.
The second iteration identified additional flagellins, followed by the type E botulinum toxin (BoNT/E) from C.
butyricum with an E-value of 0.05 [23% sequence identity
over residues 88–406 of flagellin and 727–1045 (region
II) of BoNT/E, see Additional File 2 for the alignment]. To
check for the influence of composition on the alignment,

two permutation reshuffling tests were performed, which
calculate the probability that random sequences of the
same composition could result in similar alignment
scores. The permutation reshuffling tests detected significant sequence similarity between the two proteins with (p
= 0.0024) and without (p = 0.011) statistically overrepresented amino acids included (see Methods).
According to the sequence alignments produced by PSIBLAST and SSEARCH, the region of CNTs with the strongest detected similarity to CBO0798 (region II) includes
most of the translocase domain as well as the HCRn
domain (Figure 2B–D). Region I was also detected by
SSEARCH (Additional File 1), spanning the peptidase and
'belt' region, though without definitive statistical significance (E = 0.41). The translocase, an extended alpha-helical domain, has a general structural similarity to the

central helical regions of known flagellin structures (see
PDB IDs 1io1, 2zbi, 2d4x). The beta-rich domains of flagellin are highly variable however, and it is this variable
region of flagellin that shares similarity with the HCRn
domain of CNTs. As a structure is not available for the variable region of CBO0798, 3D-PSSM [24] was used to predict the fold of CBO0798's central region. The structure
for the CNT's HCRn jelly-roll domain was the top ranked
structural match for this region (E = 0.34), additionally
supporting homology between the two proteins.
CBO0798 is annotated in the NCBI database as a member
of the flagellar hook associated protein 3 (FlgL) family.
This flagellin gene has been mentioned in previous CNT
studies due to its close proximity to the neurotoxin gene
cluster [13] and its existence in numerous C. botulinum
type A strains and associated plasmids [25]. Flagellins are

also known to have key roles in the virulence of bacterial
pathogens [26], have been shown by mass spectrometry
studies to interact with CNT components [27], and possess previously unreported common structural features
with CNTs (i.e., both contain a central region composed
of extended alpha-helices followed by beta-rich domains
[4,28]). These additional functional and structural links
further support a potential evolutionary relationship
between CBO0798 and CNTs.
Collagenase-like domains in the flagellin hypervariable
region
Comparative sequence analysis of CBO0798 was performed by aligning CBO0798 to other flagellins from
Clostridium species (Additional File 3). According to the
alignment, CBO0798 has a highly divergent central region
containing a unique insert (residues ~135–360), and this
insert region comprises a large portion of CBO0798's
alignments with CNTs. The existence of a unique central
region within CBO0798 is not surprising, since flagellins
are known to contain conserved regions at the N- and Cterminus but have a hypervariable central region that is
structurally exposed on the flagellar surface [26]. As the
structurally exposed region of the flagellar filament, the
hypervariable region can interact with the host cell and is
thus critical to flagellin-mediated virulence [26]. Interestingly, it is the variable region of CBO0798 that is central
to the CBO0798-CNT alignments and that was predicted
by 3D-PSSM to possess a jelly-roll fold similar to HCRn.

To characterize the origins of the insert, we examined similarly located inserts identified within the hypervariable
region of a small number of additional flagellins from
Clostridium species (Additional File 3). While the
sequences within the hypervariable region are highly
divergent from one another as expected, one insert in particular [the insert of FliA(H) from C. haemolyticum] was
identified to be both the largest insert and the only insert
region with detected homology to other proteins using
PSI-BLAST. FliA(H) is a relatively close homolog of
CBO0798, as FliA(H) was the only flagellin detected using
CBO0798's C-terminal region (residues 114–452) as a
BLAST query sequence (E = 0.076). A PSI-BLAST search
revealed that the hypervariable region of FliA(H) possesses significant similarity to microbial collagenases (E =
8e-04, iteration 2) and to the hypervariable regions of several flagellins from non-clostridial species (Figure 3).
Remarkably, both the detected microbial collagenases
and collagenase-like regions within the identified flagellins contain a HEXXH motif, the critical catalytic residues
responsible for the CNT's zinc-endopeptidase activity. The
alignment of CBO0798 with collagenase-containing flagellins and alignment of the HEXXH-containing segments
from these flagellins, BoNT/B, and a representative microbial collagenase are shown in Figure 3.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/316

The identified link to collagenase sequences by analysis of
the flagellin hypervariable region is a striking result given
the strong similarities between collagenases and the
CNT's Peptidase M27 domain. Both collagenases (Peptidase M9s) and Peptidase M27's are zinc-endopeptidases
and are grouped under the same peptidase family (thermolysin-like Peptidase MA clan) by the MEROPS database
[18]. As exotoxins, collagenases play a major role in
clostridial toxicity by degrading collagenous host tissues
[29,30]. For instance, C. perfringens, a species responsible
for clostridial myonecrosis (gas gangrene), produces a tissue-degrading collagenase known as kappa-toxin [30].
Collagenases are therefore an excellent candidate evolutionary precursor of CNTs as both collagenases and CNTs
function as clostridial toxins, and both share the same
fundamental proteolytic mechanism.
As the hypervariable region encodes the outer exposed
portion of the flagellin filament, it would be ideally situated to interact with (and potentially degrade) host cell
wall components such as collagen. The identified
sequences may therefore encode a novel family of virulent
flagellins with collagenase activity. Future experimental
verification of this predicted activity would be valuable,
and could potentially lead to new avenues of research
concerning the virulent functions of bacterial flagellins.
Additional evidence of collagenase-related functions
within the neurotoxin gene cluster
Several additional links to collagenases and collagenrelated domains were detected for other sequences present
within the BoNT/A neurotoxin gene cluster. All sequenced
Clostridium genomes were screened for potential homologues of each of the BoNT/A neurotoxin gene cluster
components. In a dataset of over 55000 sequences, a
search of BoNT/A detected flagellin as the third top ranked
hit outside of the CNT family (E = 0.23). While HA33
expectedly displayed similarities with other ricin-like
components (e.g., a ricin-domain from a C. acetobutylicum
cellulase, NP_347343, E = 0.019), HA70 displayed the
strongest similarity to C. perfringens enterotoxin
(YP_697710, E = 0.0042) followed by C. tetani collagenase (NP_783761, E = 0.22). A HEXXH binding motif
was also identified within this collagenase sequence. A
PSI-BLAST search of flagellin CBO0798 restricted to the
Clostridium genus also detected collagen-adhesion proteins with alignments spanning the hypervariable region
after three iterations (E = 0.017, ZP_02635881). This
result is consistent with the analysis linking CBO0798
with flagellins containing collagenase-like hypervariable
regions.

Another key result was obtained when examining
sequence and structural similarities between the HCRn
domain and the full NCBI nr database, including eukary-

otic sequences. After two iterations starting with BoNT/A's
HCRn domain, PSI-BLAST detected a region of chicken
type XII collagen (AAA48635, E = 0.03). The detected
sequence similarity occurred with collagen's thrombospondin N-terminal like domains. Recently, the structure of this family of domains has been determined for the
NC4 domain of collagen IX [31]. The fold of NC4 (PDB
ID 2UUR) is remarkably similar to that of HCRn (Figure
4). To determine the extent of structural similarity
between these two domains, we analyzed structural neighbours of the NC4 domain using the VAST structural alignment algorithm [32]. Sorted by VAST E-value, the two
most structurally similar domains to PDB ID 2UUR were

its identified fold family (PDB IDs 2ES3 and 2OUJ), the
thrombospondin N-terminal domain), followed by the
HCRn domain (PDB ID 1DLL) of the tetanus neurotoxin
(E = 10e-9.9). Ranked by sequence similarity based on
structural alignments, the tetanus HCRn domain (PDB ID
1YYN) ranked first out of all known structures in the Protein Data Bank (%ID = 17.7).
As the detected similarities between the HCRn domain
and the collagen NC4 domain occur across kingdoms, this
may represent an instance of structural mimicry rather
than a direct evolutionary relationship. Given the multiple identified links to collagenases, and that structural

mimicry of collagen has been proposed as a mechanism
for other collagenase enzymes [33], the link between
HCRn and the collagen NC4 domain may be indicative of
a similar mechanism. A role in collagen-binding is
entirely possible for CNTs as previous studies have shown
that expression of TeNT enhances adhesion of epithelial
cells to collagen, laminin, and fibronectin [34]. While the
observed similarities support the hypothesis of convergent evolution and structural mimicry, the possibility that
HCRn was transferred to Clostridium from a eukaryotic
source cannot be completely ruled out. This scenario has
been demonstrated recently for the Clostridium glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene [35].

Conclusion
A comprehensive search was conducted for potential distant homologues of CNTs, starting with a genomic analysis of C. botulinum strain A, followed by a more general
search involving additional clostridial and eukaryotic species. Multiple independent links to collagenase-related
sequences were identified, including the detected similarities involving the upstream flagellin gene (CBO0798) in
the BoNT/A neurotoxin gene cluster, distant BLAST hits to
collagenase-related domains, and detected structural similarities to the collagen NC4 domain. As microbial collagenases are phyletically widespread compared to CNTs,
they represent a protein family likely to be ancestral to
CNTs. Given this and the multiple detected links to collagenase-related sequences, it is proposed that the ancestral
function of the neurotoxin gene cluster may have been
related to collagen binding and degradation, a hypothesis
that places CNT sequence, structure, and function within
the broader context of other clostridial toxins and the evolution of clostridial pathogenesis.

The CBO0798 flagellin gene appears to be a divergent
member of a unique class of flagellins containing a collagenase-like hypervariable domain, an ideal arrangement
for the development of novel virulent functions and coevolution with host cell walls. It is possible that repeats
and rearrangements of a gene ancestral to CBO0798 may
have been involved in the origin of the ancestral CNT
gene. To date, the CBO0798 flagellin sequence has only
been identified in a number of group I strains (see [25]),
and identification and analysis of additional CBO0798
homologues in other strains could provide a broader context to the evolutionary relationship between flagellins,
collagenases, and CNTs.

from the FASTA package (version 3.515) was used to
search the C. botulinum protein database, and was
obtained via the SANGER website ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/

regression by reshuffling the target sequence library
(removing the influence of homologous sequences
present within the genome). For searching additional
Clostridium species, the following protein sequence databases were retrieved from the NCBI FTP server: C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824, C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052, C.

target database proteins on the X-axis, and data values correspond to percentile ranks. This approach was used to
detect distant pairwise similarities within gene clusters

Permutation testing
The PRSS component of the FASTA package [21] was used
for sequence reshuffling and the permutation test. The
permutation reshuffling test calculates the optimal SmithWaterman alignments of the first query sequence with N
reshuffled versions of the second query sequence. The
alignment score of the unshuffled sequences is compared
to the distribution of scores obtained using the reshuffled
query sequence, which is fit to an extreme value distribution. From this distribution, the probability that the
observed alignment score could have resulted from a random sequence of the same composition is estimated.
Default parameters were used and 1000 reshuffled
sequences were used to generate the random distribution
of alignment scores.

To detect potential compositional bias, the composition
of CNTs and CBO0798 was analyzed relative to all protein
sequences in C. botulinum strain A as a reference. One
amino acid type, asparagine, was found to be significantly
elevated in both CBO0798 and CNT sequences (Z > 2
standard deviations). To verify that PSI-BLAST hits from
CBO0798 to CNTs sequences were not due to composition, all asparagine residues were removed from
CBO0798 and the top-scoring alignment detected via PSIBLAST (C. butyricum BoNT/E), and permutation reshuffling tests were repeated using the altered sequences.

Authors' contributions
A.C.D. designed and performed the analysis and wrote the
paper. B.J.M. designed the analysis and co-wrote the
paper. E.M.M., M.D.J.L. and K.M.M. assisted with analysis
and preparation of the manuscript.

Detected sequence similarities between CBO0798 (flagellin) and
CNT sequences. SSEARCH was used to screen the C. botulinum A protein database (3615 sequences) plus the target CNTs using default
parameters. E-values were calculated within SSEARCH using randomly
reshuffled copies of the library sequences, as described in Methods.
CBO0798's rank relative to all 3615 C. botulinum proteins, associated
E-value, and the alignment regions are reported for nine search cases
(BoNT/A-G, TeNT, and NTNHA). The flagellin aligned to two separate
regions in the CNTs, suggesting an ancestral duplication.

Multiple alignment of clostridial flagellins. The N- and C-terminal
domains are indicated, and the intermediate section represents the flagellin hypervariable region. The collagenase-like insert identified within the
hypervariable region of FliA(H) is boxed in red. CBO0798 is underlined
in black. Additional clostridial flagellins containing large hypervariable
region inserts are grouped with CBO0798 and FliA(H) at the beginning
of the alignment.
