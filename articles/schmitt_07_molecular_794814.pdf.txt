Abstract
The climatic cycles with subsequent glacial and intergalcial periods have had a great impact on the distribution and
evolution of species. Using genetic analytical tools considerably increased our understanding of these processes.
In this review I therefore give an overview of the molecular biogeography of Europe. For means of simplification,
I distinguish between three major biogeographical entities: (i) "Mediterranean" with Mediterranean differentiation
and dispersal centres, (ii) "Continental" with extra-Mediterranean centres and (iii) "Alpine" and/or "Arctic" with
recent alpine and/or arctic distribution patterns. These different molecular biogeographical patterns are
presented using actual examples.
Many "Mediterranean" species are differentiated into three major European genetic lineages, which are due to
glacial isolation in the three major Mediterranean peninsulas. Postglacial expansion in this group of species is
mostly influenced by the barriers of the Pyrenees and the Alps with four resulting main patterns of postglacial
range expansions. However, some cases are known with less than one genetic lineage per Mediterranean
peninsula on the one hand, and others with a considerable genetic substructure within each of the Mediterranean
peninsulas, Asia Minor and the Maghreb. These structures within the Mediterranean sub-centres are often rather
strong and in several cases even predate the Pleistocene.
For the "Continental" species, it could be shown that the formerly supposed postglacial spread from eastern
Palearctic expansion centres is mostly not applicable. Quite the contrary, most of these species apparently had
extra-Mediterranean centres of survival in Europe with special importance of the perialpine regions, the
Carpathian Basin and parts of the Balkan Peninsula.
In the group of "Alpine" and/or "Arctic" species, several molecular biogeographical patterns have been found,
which support and improve the postulates based on distribution patterns and pollen records. Thus, genetic
studies support the strong linkage between southwestern Alps and Pyrenees, northeastern Alps and Carpathians
as well as southeastern Alps and the Dinaric mountain systems, hereby allowing conclusions on the glacial
distribution patterns of these species. Furthermore, genetic analyses of arctic-alpine disjunct species support their
broad distribution in the periglacial areas at least during the last glacial period.
The detailed understanding of the different phylogeographical structures is essential for the management of the
different evolutionary significant units of species and the conservation of their entire genetic diversity.
Furthermore, the distribution of genetic diversity due to biogeographical reasons helps understanding the differing
regional vulnerabilities of extant populations.

Background
Distributions of animal and plant species are extremely
variable in time and space [1-9]. Thus, the strong climatic
oscillations of the Pleistocene [10] repeatedly forced
many species to major latitudinal and/or altitudinal range
shifts [1-4]. These range changes were postulated based on
chorological analysis (i.e. localisation of the core areas of
distributions) [1,2,11-14], and could be traced through
fossil records, e.g. from pollen [15-18], charcoal fragments [19], the elytra of beetles [20-22], remains of small
mammals [23] and gastropod shells [24-26]. Many of
these evidences were supported by genetic analyses [5-9].
However, the resolution of such genetic analyses often
exceeds that of the classical methods, and even some cases
are known in which the molecular methods unravel misinterpretations of chorological analyses and shortcomings
of the other classical methods [8,27-30].
In this short review, I give a brief overview of the molecular biogeography in the western Palearctic. In the following, I distinguish between three major biogeographic
groups in Europe: (i) "Mediterranean" species with Mediterranean differentiation and expansion centres, (ii)
"Continental" species with extra-Mediterranean centres
and (iii) "Alpin" and/or "Arctic" species, which are found
in alpine and/or arctic centres of retreat today. For each of
these three groups, I give a brief overview of the main iceage distributions patterns, of the postglacial range changes
and their consequences on the genetic structure.
To test biogeographical patterns, one should select model
species fulfilling the following criteria: (i) the species must
have a sufficiently high dispersal ability to spread rapidly
into newly emerging suitable habitats ensuring that the
species occupies the available space, (ii) once established,
populations must be large and stable to reflect large scale
structures (i.e. phylogeographic signals) and not recent
local population structures, and (iii) although having a
high dispersal ability, the single individual has to be
mostly sedentary so that the phylogeographic patterns are
not blurred as for example in migratory species. These criteria are well accomplished by many butterfly and burnet
species. Furthermore, quite representative examples for
the biogeographical groups mentioned above are known
for this group of animals, which therefore is used as preferred model group in this review.
For the classification of the biogeographical groups, I use
the definition of faunal elements sensu de Lattin [2] referring to the last dispersal centre and not to the recent distribution pattern of a taxon. The latter is commonly used
in plants whereas the former is often applied in zoogeography [31]. Thus, the recent distribution of a Mediterranean element sensu de Lattin [2] can reach Scandinavia in
the North, but it is considered Mediterranean, if the last

refugium was in the Mediterranean Basin expanding
northwards in the postglacial.

Mediterranean species
The three major Mediterranean peninsulas of Europe as
glacial refugia
Almost all European species of Mediterranean origin have
had their ice-age refugia in at least one of the three major
European peninsulas of the Mediterranean area (i.e. Iberia, Italy and the Balkans; Figure 1), and most of the more
widespread species had ice-age refugia in all the three of
them [4-6,9]. In the majority of cases, the populations of
these three peninsulas had no or only limited exchange of
individuals and thus the populations of these disjuncted
areas evolved independently often resulting in three
major genetic groups, one for each of these peninsulas as
shown for a large number of different animal and plant
species [4,6,9]. These structures were also found in butterflies, as in the chalk-hill blues Polyommatus coridon/hispana
complex (Figure 2) [32,33], the marbled whites Melanargia galathea/lachesis complex [34] and the adonis blue
Polyommatus bellargus [35].

However, some cases became recently known in which no
genetic differentiation among these three refugial centres
were detected. Thus, the meadow brown Maniola jurtina
only shows two major genetic lineages, one Atlantic-Mediterranean lineage and a Central-Eastern-Mediterranean
one (Figure 3) [36]. These allozyme data are supported by
morphological data of the male genitalia and of the wings
of both sexes [37]. The eastern phylogenetic group most
probably is due to considerable gene flow between the
Adriatic- and the Pontic-Mediterranean centres during the
last ice-age, whereas the Atlantic-Mediterranean area
remained isolated. In an allozyme study of the common
blue Polyommatus icarus over major parts of Europe no differentiation among the three major European refugial
areas has been detected [38], thus supporting constant
gene flow for this species on a European scale even during
the last ice-age. As the common blue is recently distributed as far north as northern Scandinavia [39] and the arctic parts of Asia [40], a relatively wide European
distribution even during glacial periods is feasible, thus
making P. icarus not a typical Mediterranean species.
Refugia within refugia – genetic differentiations within the
Mediterranean sub-centres
A sub-division of the large Mediterranean refugia, based
on chorological analyses, was previously postulated e.g.
by Reinig [41]. These assumptions have recently been supported by genetic analyses, and a large number of taxa
show a strong sub-structuring within the Mediterranean
sub-centres such as the Maghreb, Iberia, peninsular Italy,
the Balkans and Asia Minor.

[5]).

The Atlantic-Mediterranean element
The Atlantic-Mediterranean refugial area embraces Iberia
and the major part of the Maghreb [2] and thus is divided
into an African and a European part by the Strait of Gibraltar, and several examples of strongly differentiated taxa
north and south of this sea barrier are known, especially
in amphibians as in the genera Pleurodeles, Discoglossus,
Alytes, Pelobates, Rana and Salamandra [42-51]. This sea
water barrier has permanently existed since the end of the
Messinian Salinity Crisis about 5.33 Ma ago [52-55], and
thus has strongly impeded the migration of sea water
intolerant organisms like amphibians. Nevertheless,
strongly differentiated genetic lineages on both sides of
the Strait of Gibraltar are also known e.g. in the lizard
Psammodromus algirus [56] and the butterfly sibling species complex M. galathea/lachesis [34].

In groups of organisms not being strongly restricted in
their dispersal by sea (e.g. reptiles, butterflies) relatively
recent (e.g. late Pleistocene) exchange of individuals is
known, as in several snakes [57,58], turtles [59,60], tortoises [61], chameleons [62], butterflies [36], bark beetles
[63], but also in the frog Hyla meridionalis [64]. The more
southern and thus warmer Maghreb more often represented the centre of origin [47,57-62,64-70] than Iberia
[56].

(dotted area) in the three Mediterranean peninsulas of
Southern Europe and main directions of the Postglacial range
expansion (solid arrows) [32,33,122,123,177].

In many cases, the Maghreb populations show remarkable
east-west differentiations as in the lizard P. algirus [56],
the snake Malpolon monspessulanus [58] and the shrew Crocidura russula [70] most probably representing the frequent existence of eastern and western sub-centres of
differentiation. In the turtle Mauremys leprosa, the two
Maghreb lineages are separated by the Atlas Mts. in
Morocco and Algeria with the southern lineage expanding
from southern Morocco to the Mediterranean Sea in Tunisia [60]. This distribution matches the Mauretanic-Mediterranean sub-centre postulated by de Lattin [2].
In Iberia, a strong genetic differentiation into a western
and an eastern group is also known for a larger number of
species as in the case of Pleurodeles newts [47,48,66], Discoglossus frogs [50], the burnet moth Aglaope infausta [71],
the lizards P. algirus [56] and perhaps Acanthodactylus
erythrurus [72]. Paleoclimatology shows that the climatically most favourable areas of Iberia were in disjunct areas
in the southwestern and the southeastern parts of the
peninsula [73]. Therefore, it is most likely that xero-thermophilic species had two disjunct areas of glacial survival
and differentiation in the Iberian Peninsula [71]. However, several of these and other taxa evolved an even more
complex genetic structure beyond this simple east-west
split [46,50,51,65,74-80].
Thus, the Iberian lizard species Lacerta schreiberi consists
of four major genetic lineages, two coastal clades and two
inland clades, most probably representing four disjunct
areas of glacial survival in Iberia with only the northern
coastal clade becoming expansive during the postglacial
[74]. Chioglossa lusitanica, an endemic salamander species

southernmost tip of Italy. The origin of the latter is still
ambiguous, and the widespread lineage might have
entered Iberia only in the postglacial [45]. The Timarchia
goettingensis complex shows a highly complex genetic
structure in Iberia implying a series of vicariance events
and differentiation centres for this beetle [75,76].

of northwestern Iberia, has a none-expansive clade in central Portugal and an expansive clade in northern Portugal
and northwestern Spain [81,82]. The western lineage of P.
algirus is further divided into a southern and a northern
sub-cluster [56]. As much as six lineages are distinguished
in the western Iberian endemic newt Lissotriton boscai, and
three of these lineages are confined to southwestern Portugal [80]. These structures strongly support the existence
of several sub-refugia in Iberia along the Pleistocene often
resulting in remarkable differentiations between genetic
lineages.
The southwest of Portugal revealed to be of special importance as refugial area. This is further supported by the
rather fine-grained genetic lineages of the cyprinid Squalius aradensis in the Algarve (southern Portugal) [78], and
the extremely high haplotype diversity of M. leprosa in
southern Portugal [60] underlining the long-term persistence of taxa in this part of Iberia. If postglacial northwards
expansions occurred in one of these lineages within Iberia, remarkable genetic impoverishment is the frequently
observed result [60,63,74,81,82] as in other species on the
continental scale (see below) [4].
The fire salamander Salamandra salamandra is also present
in three lineages in Iberia, one endemic lineage in the
south, another in central and northern Iberia, which is the
predominant lineage of Europe, and a third one in a limited area in Cantabria that is identical with the one in the

The Adriatic-Mediterranean element
The Adriatic-Mediterranean refugial area is represented by
peninsular Italy [2]. As the geographical diversity of this
area and the total land mass is considerably less in peninsular Italy than in Iberia, the phylogeographical patterns
are considerably simpler in the Adriatic- than in the Atlantic-Mediterranean region. Truly Mediterranean species
like the bark beetle Tomicus destruens [63] and the Apennine yellow-bellied toad Bombina pachypus [83] only survived in relatively restricted areas of Calabria and Sicily,
and only expanded to more northern regions of Italy
when the climate warmed in the postglacial; hereby, they
lost genetic diversity. Calabria is particularly rich in
strongly differentiated lineages, e.g. four in the Italian wall
lizard Podarcis sicula [84], two in S. salamandra [45] and
two in B. pachypus [83]. This underlines the great importance of this area as refugial region and its particular substructure. However, Sicily is not differentiated from
Calabria in most cases reflecting the close geographic
proximity with the peculiar exception of the hedgehog Erinaceus europaeus showing a remarkable genetic differentiation in Sicily [85].

Apart from differentiation centres in southern Italy, several species also show distinct lineages in the northern
part of peninsular Italy, such as the lizard P. sicula [84],
the grasshopper Chorthippus parallelus [86], the honey bee
Apis mellifera [87], and the asp viper Vipera aspis [88], thus
underlining the existence of additional allopatric differentiation centres in this region. In some cases different lineages expanding in Italy from the south and the north (the
latter sometimes with their roots outside of Italy) have
built up hybrid zones in Italy as in the case of the honey
bee [87] and the bark beetle T. destruens [63].
The Pontic-Mediterranean element
The Pontic-Mediterranean refugial region sensu de Lattin
[2] embraces the Balkan Peninsula, Asia Minor and the
east coast of the Mediterranean as far south as Palestine.
For this area even Reinig [41] suggested a number of subcentres, a hypothesis which is strongly supported by
recent genetic analyses in this region. Thus, often deep
genetic splits between the Balkan Peninsula and Asia
Minor support the long lasting biogeographic isolation of
these two areas as e.g. detected in the hedgehog Erinaceus
concolor [85,89], the grasshopper C. parallelus [86], the
bark beetle T. destruens [63] and most probably the badger
Meles meles [90].

Several genetic data sets support Reinig's idea [41] of several sub-centres in the Balkan Peninsula. Thus, phylogeographic work on the pond turtle Emys orbicularis [59], the
fire-bellied toad Bombina variegata [91], the hedgehog E.
concolor [85,89] and the slug Arion fuscus [30] all support
an east-west split of the Balkan Peninsula with western
Illyrian and eastern Aegean phylogroups. A similar situation was found in the marbled white M. galathea [92]. The
allozyme analysis of individuals from southeastern
Europe support at least three centres of survival along the
Mediterranean coasts of the Balkans: the Illyrian Coast,
the Aegean Coast and the southwestern coast of the Black
Sea. Whether these three centres of dispersal were linked
to each other during the Würm ice-age or not is still
unknown.
Old splits in the southern Balkan Peninsula even date
back to the formation of the mid-Aegean trench (12 to 9
Ma ago) [93]. This event has been reported to have acted
as a major factor determining the biogeographical patterns of scorpions [94,95] and reptiles [96,97]. In the scorpion Iurus dufoureius this vicariance is mirrored in a
western group from the Peloponnisos to Crete island and
an eastern clade from Karpathos island to southwestern
Turkey [94]. In other species, more complex genetic patterns evolved with localised endemic lineages especially
in the long-term isolated islands of the southern Kyklades
and Crete as in the scorpion Mesobuthus gibbosus [95],
Podarcis lizards [96,97] and land snails [98,99].
Postglacial range expansions: the four paradigms
The postglacial re-colonisation of Central and Northern
Europe by Mediterranean species followed in general four
paradigm patterns [5,6,34]: (i) the hedgehog (postglacial
expansion from all three southern European differentiation centres) [100], (ii) the bear (expansion of the western
and the eastern lineage, but trapping of the Adriatic-Mediterranean lineage by the Alps, nota bene that the expansion of the eastern lineage in the bear example is not from
the Pontic-Mediterranean region but from an eastern continental differentiation centre) [101], (iii) the butterfly
(expansion of the Adriatic- and the Pontic-Mediterranean
lineages, but trapping of the Atlantic-Mediterranean lineage by the Pyrenees) [34] and (iv) the grasshopper (major
expansion to Central Europe only from the Balkans and
trapping of the Atlantic- and Adriatic-Mediterranean lineages by the Pyrenees and Alps, respectively) [86].

These paradigms are frequently repeated in many animal
and plant species, thus the "hedgehog" paradigm e.g. in
oaks Quercus ssp. [102], the silver fir Abies alba [103] and
the house mouse Mus musculus [104], the "bear" in e.g. the
shrews Sorex araneus [105,106] and Crocidura suaveolens
[9] and the water vole Arvicola terrestris [9] and the "grasshopper" e.g. in the black alder Alnus glutinosa [107], the

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/4/1/11

common beech Fagus sylvatica [108] and the newt Triturus
cristatus [109]. Only three examples are actually known
for the "butterfly" paradigm: the marbled whites M.
galathea/lachesis complex [34], the chalk-hill blues P. coridon/hispana complex (Figure 2) [33] and, based on a small
data set, the adonis blue P. bellargus [35]. The latter paradigm might be a common phylogeographical structure for
quickly expanding species, so that the Italian lineage
might have expanded rapidly, passing westwards south of
the Alps and afterwards expanding all over southern
France, so that this space had been occupied when individuals of the Iberian lineage started to pass the Pyrenees.
However, further examples are needed for this paradigm's
support.
Genetic consequences of Postglacial range expansion
The Postglacial range changes had major impact on the
genetic conditions of the affected species. Therefore, it is
of major importance for the genetic texture whether a species is expanding phalanx like, stepping stone or leptokurtic [110].

In the first case, the species perform only weak genetic differentiation during the process of range expansion, often
without loss of genetic diversity. Such structures are characteristic for species with wide ecological amplitudes and
were also found in common butterfly species like in the
green-veined white Pieris napi [111,112], the common
blue P. icarus [38], the small tortoiseshell Aglais urticae
[113], the meadow brown M. jurtina [36] and the marbled
white M. galathea [34]. All these species do not show significant losses of their genetic diversity from their expansion centres towards their recent northern distribution
border.
On the contrary, stepping stone and leptokurtic dispersal
are responsible for the evolution of genetic patterns along
the process of expansion often going along with the loss
of genetic information during the processes of expansion,
as shown for many animal and plant species [114-121].
Such a genetic structure is characteristic for species with
specific habitat requirements so that no phalanx can
expand, but only some few individuals reach so far unoccupied emerging habitats, as also known for the chalk-hill
blue P. coridon. This species shows a linear loss of genetic
diversity from the south to the north in its Pontic-Mediterranean lineage [122] and a stepwise loss of genetic diversity in the Adriatic-Mediterranean lineage (i.e. no loss of
genetic diversity over larger distances as from southern
France to northeastern France, and abrupt reduction of
genetic diversity as a decrease of 10% of the number of
alleles resulting from the passing through of the Burgundian Gate between the Vosges and the Jura Mts.) [123].

Contact zones in Europe
As a consequence of postglacial range expansion in the
group of species of Mediterranean origin, a network of
contact zones is spread over Europe (Figure 1). However,
these contact zones between different genetic lineages are
not randomly scattered over the continent, but show a systematic pattern. Thus, the mountain systems of the Pyrenees and Alps, often acting as dispersal barriers, represent
two important areas where different biota met, but also
three other regions of Europe show a high number of secondary contact zones between genetic lineages [5,6,9]: (i)
western Central Europe along the French-German border
region and along the western Alps (Figure 3), (ii) eastern
Central Europe along the eastern borders of Germany and
through the eastern Alps and (iii) running east-west
through central Scandinavia.

For butterflies, the meadow brown M. jurtina has a typical
contact zone in western Central Europe where the Atlantic-Mediterranean lineage meet with the Central-EasternMediterranean group (Figure 3), which is supported by
two allozyme studies, the morphology of the male genitalia and three wing patterns [36,37]. Along the French-German border regions, no natural obstacles are separating
these two lineages; apparently, these lineages have met in
that area and the populations, once set up by one evolutionary lineage, remained mostly stable over time; however, some hybridisation in Belgium and the Netherlands
is possible, based on the morphology of the male genitalia
[37].
Evidence for the eastern Central European contact zone
exists e.g. for two butterfly species. The two major genetic
lineages of the chalk-hill blue P. coridon, based on allozyme analysis and wing patterns, meet in this region (Figure 2) [32,33]. Mostly all along this contact zone the
natural conditions for the survival of this warm-loving
species of calcareous grasslands [124,125] limit its existence: an acid sandy area in northeastern Germany, acid
cold mountains ranges along the Czech-German border
region and the watersheds of the eastern Alps [32] so that
this contact zone might partly be shaped by natural
expansion obstacles too, but not so extreme as in the cases
of the Alps and Pyrenees. The Czech-German border
mountains also act as contact zone for the woodland ringlet Erebia medusa; these mountains apparently were
reached by an eastern and a western lineage early in the
postglacial (more details on the molecular biogeography
of this continental species in the next chapter), but the
high elevations of these mountains could only be colonised by the species some time after its arrival so that the
main ridges mostly represent the contact zone between
both lineages [126].

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/4/1/11

Continental species
Formerly, a considerable proportion of the European
fauna was considered of eastern Palearctic origin with
postglacial expansion from Siberian or Mandshurian refugia throughout Asia to Europe [2]. This postulate has been
questioned for a long time e.g. by Varga [3] and recent
publications give rising evidence even for the existence of
cryptic northern refugia north of the Alps and Pyrenees
[127]. Thus, genetic analyses unravel extra-Mediterranean
ice-age refugia in Europe in a series of other animal species as in the adder Vipera berus in the Carpathian Basin,
areas adjoining the Alps and one or more areas in central
Europe [128], in the frog Rana arvalis in the Carpathian
Basin [129,130], the fish Cottus gobio in Germany [131],
the voles Microtus arvalis in the Black Forest region and
maybe elsewhere in Central Europe [132], Microtus agrestis
[133] and Clethrionomys glareolus [28], the ant Formica
pratensis in the Pyrenean region [134], the slug Arion fuscus
in the region of the High Tatras [30] and the nematode
Heligmosomoides polygyrus [29]. Thus, extra-Mediterranean
ice-age refugia in Europe might be a much more common
feature in temperate continental species than previously
thought, but more investigation in the field of continental
species is urgently needed [127].
A particularly interesting and well studied species in the
group of continental species represents the woodland
ringlet E. medusa. There is good evidence based on allozyme data that this species had multiple Würm ice-age differentiation centres around the glaciated Alps, in the
Carpathian region and in the Balkan Peninsula ([27,135];
TS unpublished data). This glacial distribution pattern in
E. medusa and most probably in other similar species too
(one further good example with strikingly similar genetic
pattern being the adder [128]) might be due to the particular climatic conditions in Europe during the ice-ages: (i)
the climate was predominantly much drier than today
and (ii) the continentality of the climate was increasing
westwards [10]. Therefore, not only the low temperatures,
but also lack of precipitation restricted the distribution of
many animal and plant species during the glacial phases
of the Pleistocene. While the temperature might have
been the major restriction for the distribution of the
above discussed Mediterranean species, the dryness might
have been even more important for many of the taxa out
of the group of continental species. Erebia medusa [136]
and V. berus [137] for example are recently distributed in
Central Asia in regions with extremely cold winters so that
the temperatures in Central Europe during the ice-ages
might not have been the main constraint for their distributions. In contrast to temperature, the dryness of Central
Europe might have been the limiting factor for the species'
glacial distributions in Europe. Therefore, the survival of
the woodland ringlet as well as several other species
[30,131,132,134,138,139] in relatively small areas

adjoining the water-donating high mountain systems like
the Alps and Carpathians is feasible as well as in the proximity of the high mountain systems of the Balkan Peninsula ([27,135]; TS unpublished data).
However, there is evidence for some species having colonised Europe postglacially from eastern dispersal centres.
This is mostly the case for typical Taiga species like the
Russian flying squirrel Pteromys volans [140] and the ant
Formica lugubris [134], in which postglacial expansion
from eastern Palearctic Würm ice-age refugia is probably
based on their genetic texture, but not in a species like the
Siberian jay Perisoreus infaustus, in which western and eastern Palearctic populations belong to strongly differentiated phylogroups [141]. In butterflies, the scarce heath
Coenonympha hero shows a gradient of declining genetic
diversity from the southern Ural Mts. over Estonia to
southern Sweden, but no split into different genetic lineages [142]. This structure supports a glacial centre of survival for this species in the southern Urals and postglacial
range expansion westwards to Sweden.
The adder V. berus shows in its mtDNA haplotypes the
peculiar structure of highly differentiated genetic lineages
in Europe, but one lineage stretching from Finland and
the Baltic countries throughout Russia to the Sakhalin
island [128]. This strongly supports a centre of origin in
the western Palearctic and relatively recent (maybe even
postglacial) expansion throughout Asia, thus showing an
opposed pattern to the classical Siberian element definition sensu de Lattin [2].

Arctic and/or Alpine species
In the past it was thought that "Arctic" and/or "Alpine"
species in many cases show an almost opposed pattern to
Mediterranean species: they expand during cold stages
and become restricted to mountain or Nordic refugia during interglacials [1,2,12]. Recent work on arctic and alpine
species has revealed that this pattern was an oversimplification. In fact, there is evidence that some arctic animal
and plant species survived the last glaciation even at high
latitudes or even north of the extensive ice shields; the evidence is strong for Beringia and northeastern Asia, weaker
for the High Nearctic and doubtful for northern Europe
[8,143,144]. In general, two largely different patterns are
found in this biogeographical group:
(i) Some species were widely distributed throughout the
glacial steppes between the northern ice shield and the
glaciers in the mountains of the South, so that a large scale
gene flow was only interrupted by the postglacial disjunction into different high mountain systems and the arctic
(i.e. arctic-alpine disjunct species). This classical glacial
distribution pattern of arctic-alpine species is well sup-

ported by fossil evidence [145], but the genetic evidence is
still relatively poor [146].
Thus, a common origin of Dryas octopetala from the southern European mountains, Iceland, Scotland and Scandinavia is demonstrated by AFLP analysis [147]. Close
genetic relation between arctic populations and such from
the southern European mountains are also known for
Saxifraga oppositifolia [143], Minuartia biflora [148] and the
lycosid Pardosa saltuaria group [149]. Postglacial immigration into Scandinavia from source populations in the eastern Alps was invoked for Ranunculus glacialis because of
genetically depauperate populations relative to the otherwise quite similar alpine ones [150]. The genetic structure
of the boreo-montane bog fritillary Proclossiana eunomia
[151] implies postglacial colonization of Fennoscandia
from an eastern refugium, maybe representing the Siberian differentiation centre sensu de Lattin [2]. An eastern
origin of Scandinavian populations is also likely in Trollius
europaeus [152] and D. octopetala in the northern part
[147]. Some genetic evidence for a wide distribution in
the glacial steppes and semi-deserts is available for the
burnet moth Zygaena exulans with a rather weak differentiation between Alps and Pyrenees [153] and the water
beetle Hydroporus glabriusculus with no significant genetic
differences among populations from Britain and Scandinavia [154]. The species surviving in these environments
have to be adapted not only to rather cold, but also to
extremely dry steppic conditions with the latter maybe
excluding a large number of the typical alpine species
from the periglacial steppe belt.
(ii) Other species have probably been subject to disjunct
distribution patterns during glacial and – in many cases –
interglacial phases, thus accumulating much larger differentiation
than
species
of
the
first
group
[146,149,150,152,155-168]. Especially the dryness of the
glacial steppes and not the low temperatures might have
excluded a large number of such cold adapted species
from these areas. Therefore, many of these species became
restricted to the wetter areas in the proximity of the glaciated mountain systems [146,167,168]. Thus, multiple
(often four) refugia were scattered for various species (e.g.
R. glacialis, Phyteuma globulariifolium, Androsace alpina,
Pritzelago alpina, Drusus discolor, Erebia epiphron) along the
margins of the southern and eastern Alps [157,164,166168].
Remarkable differentiation of the inner-alpine populations of Eritrichum nanum [155,160], Saponaria pumila
[161], Rumex nivalis [165], Erinus alpinus [159], S. oppositifolia [169] and Androsace wulfeniana [164] even give
genetic support for in situ survival in the Alps (i.e. nunatak survival).

Many of the smaller European high mountain systems
own their endemic genetic lineages. The populations of
these mountain areas often simply performed altitudinal
shifts respective to climate changes and no major long distance colonisation. Thus their differentiation centres
likely existed at the foot hills of these mountains throughout the last glaciation and often even much longer, as
shown for the Cantabrian Mts. (P. eunomia [151], Pritzelago alpina [163]), the Pyrenees (P. alpina [163], D. discolor
[167], Pardosa oreophila [149], E. epiphron [168]), the Tatra
Mts. (D. discolor [167]), the Stara Planina (P. eunomia
[151]) and Pirin & Vitosha (Pardosa drenskii [149]).
However, there is good genetic evidence for glacial links
between the Pyrenees and the southwestern Alps (Anthyllis
montana [156], Erebia cassioides [170], E. epiphron [168]),
the northern Alps and the Jesenik Mts. (E. epiphron [168]),
the northern Carpathians and the northeastern Alps (P.
alpina [163], Ranunculus pygmaeus [148]) and the mountains of the western Balkan Peninsula and the southeastern Alps (A. montana [156]) during glacial periods. The
postulated five centres of differentiation of the mountain
ringlet E. epiphron illustrating the complexity of the patterns found in this biogeographical group are presented in
Figure 4[168].

Conservation implications
There is increasing evidence that the population genetic
constitution is highly important for the individual fitness
[171-173]. Meta-analyses have shown that the sensitivity
of the populations to extinction is negatively correlated
with the respective regional genetic diversity resulting
from their biogeographic history [174]. Therefore, continental species in general are more endangered in the western part of Europe than in the East, whereas
Mediterranean species perform better in the genetically
richer South than in the North [174].
These analyses underline the high importance for conservation of the populations existing in the areas of the Quaternary refugia: these populations as a whole own most of
the total genetic diversity and thus the evolutionary
potential of a species [175,176]. The frequently observed
genetic differentiations of marginal races at the high-latitude leading edge are therefore of considerably less evolutionary importance than the low-latitude rear edge
populations because (i) the high-latitude edge lineages
are mostly due to recent (i.e. postglacial) adaptation processes and not long-term evolution [176] and (ii) most of
these lineages may simply disappear leaving no descendants when the climate will become cooler again [175].
However, the high diversity of different biogeographical
patterns point out that each species has reacted independently to Pleistocene climatic changes in terms of persistence in a refugium, migration rates and colonisation

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/4/1/11

routes [175]. Therefore, generalisations for conservation
measures should be made with extreme care.

Conclusion
Europe shows a great variety of different biogeographical
patterns with (i) "Mediterranean", (ii) "Continental" and
(iii) "Arctic/Alpine" being the predominant ones.
Within the "Mediterranean" group, (i) one or (ii) more
(sometimes phylogeographically highly complex) genetic
lineage(s) evolve during glacial isolation within a single
Mediterranean peninsula or (iii) two or more peninsulas
share a single lineage. Postglacial range expansions follow
four main patterns: (i) "Hedgehog", (ii) "Bear", (iii) "Butterfly" and (iv) "Grasshopper" depending on whether
Alps and/or Pyrenees acted as postglacial expansion barrier or not. As a consequence of range expansions, biota
predominantly got into contact in five regions of Europe:
(i) along the Pyrenees' main ridge, (ii) along the Alps'
main ridges, (iii) in western Central Europe running
north-south, (iv) in eastern Central Europe running
north-south and (v) in central Scandinavia running eastwest.
In the group of "Continental" species, two major biogeographical types may be distinguished: (i) species with
non-Mediterranean glacial refugial and differentiation
centres in Europe, with special importance of the continental areas of the Balkan Peninsula, the Carpathian
Basin and the perialpine areas around the Alps, with many
of these centres of distribution being geographically rather
restricted, but in general numerous, and, to a lesser extent,

(ii) postglacial expansion from eastern differentiation
centres located in Asia with the western most possibility
being the southern Ural Mts. The latter species group is
mostly composed of typical Taiga species.

The third important pattern, the group of "Arctic" and/or
"Alpine" species, consists of two rather different subgroups: (i) species that have been widely distributed in the
periglacial steppes during the glacial periods and (ii) taxa
that also had disjunct distribution patterns during the iceages. The former group splits into (i) species only retreating northwards in the Postglacial (i.e. arctic species) and
(ii) species retreating northwards and into the mountain
systems in the south (i.e. arctic-alpine species s. str.). The
latter group, showing disjunct ice-age distribution patterns, is mostly absent from the high latitudes and often
shows a variety of genetic lineages stemming from different glacial differentiation centres, but now coexisting
within a single high mountain system, as best demonstrated for the Alps. Furthermore, several biogeographic
links between mountain systems are known in this group
best explained by glacial distribution patterns as in the
links between (i) Pyrenees and southwestern Alps, (ii)
Carpathians and northeastern Alps as well as (iii) the
Dinaric Mountain system and the southeastern Alps.
Apparently, we know quite a lot about the molecular biogeography of Europe, but many aspects still remain enigmatic. Therefore, further investigation in this field is
urgently needed to really understand and conserve the
highly complex biogeographical constitution of the European continent.
