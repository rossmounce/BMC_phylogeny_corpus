Introduction / objectives
In this study we investigated a multi-drug resistant E.coli
recovered from ascetic fluid of a haemodialysis patient
with community-onset urinary tract infection from AlAmiri hospital in Kuwait. The patient was suffering
from advanced liver disease with portal hypertension
and multiple current inter abdominal abscesses.
Methods
Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by Vitek2,
Microscan, disc diffusion, E-test & double disc method
against antibiotics. PCR& sequencing were performed
forO25pabBspe,pabB, trpA, chuA, yjaA TSPE4, blaSHV,
blaTEM, blaCTX-M15, bla OXA-1-like , aac(6′)-Ib-cr, tet
(A), tet(B), gyrA, parC, plasmid mediated qnrA, qnrB,
qnrS, IMP, SPM, VIM, OXA-48, NDM, KPC and classes
1and 2 integrons.
Results
The isolate was confirmed as E. coli O25b-sequence type
(ST) 131 clone of B2 phylogenetic group. The isolate
was resistant to all antibiotics tested except sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim and nitrofurantoin and Etest confirmed that it is highly resistant to meropenem,
imipenem, ciprofloxacin, cefotaxime and ceftazidime
with MIC values of >16 mg/l, 32 mg/l, >64 mg/l, 32
mg/l & >32mg/l respectively. PCR detected the expected
sizes of the amplified resistance genes, and DNA
sequencing confirmed that TEM-1, the novel SHV-122
GeneBank (GQ290211), CTX-M-15, OXA-1, variant aac

(6′)-Ib-cr, tet(A) genes, VIM and KPC were present and
it was found to carry a class 1 integron. No mutation
was found in gyrA but in ParC a mutation at 520 G to
C, with amino acid change 174 Val (GTC) to Leu
(CTC) was detected. QnrA, B, S and integron 2 were
not present.

Conclusion
This is the first report of the emergence and the detection of a multiple antibiotic resistant E. coli O25bsequence type (ST)131 containing 2 carbapenemase
genes in Kuwait.
Disclosure of interest
