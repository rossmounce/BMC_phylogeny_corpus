Introduction
Population HLA-dependent evolution has been documented over the principal HIV proteins. Effect of subtype
variability is uncertain. In Argentina, B subtype and
recombinant BF variants circulate in equal proportions.

types and that variants from subtype B and BF could
respond differently to both natural and vaccine-induced
immune response.

Methods
Blood samples were collected from 94 drug-naive HIV
infected individuals. DNA and RNA extraction were performed from PBMC and plasma, respectively. HLA-A and
B genes were genotyped by PCR-SSOP. Pol and vpu genes
were amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced. Aminoacidic
positions were codified as 0 = "equal state" (to consensus
sequence) and 1 = "variated state" (polymorphism). Phylogenetic analyses were performed by BootScanning. Statistical analysis was performed by ODDS-ratio/power
calculations, Fischer exact test, Logistic regression and randomization tests. Potential new epitopes and affinities
with HLA were assessed by using BIMAS software.

Results
We found 95 polymorphisms associated with different
HLA alleles. 44 out of them were inside predicted epitopes
for the associated HLA allele. 13 out of them reduced the
affinity for the HLA allele in the "variated" state. 5 out of
them were associated with viral subtype.

Conclusion
Our results suggest that vpu could be undergoing adaptation to the immune response at the population level, as
previously reported for pol gen. Associations with viral
subtype suggest that this evolution is different among sub-
