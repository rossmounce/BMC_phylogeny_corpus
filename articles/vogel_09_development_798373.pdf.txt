Abstract
Background: Brachypodium distachyon (Brachypodium) is rapidly emerging as a powerful model
system to facilitate research aimed at improving grass crops for grain, forage and energy
production. To characterize the natural diversity of Brachypodium and provide a valuable new tool
to the growing list of resources available to Brachypodium researchers, we created and
characterized a large, diverse collection of inbred lines.
Results: We developed 84 inbred lines from eight locations in Turkey. To enable genotypic
characterization of this collection, we created 398 SSR markers from BAC end and EST sequences.
An analysis of 187 diploid lines from 56 locations with 43 SSR markers showed considerable
genotypic diversity. There was some correlation between SSR genotypes and broad geographic
regions, but there was also a high level of genotypic diversity at individual locations. Phenotypic
analysis of this new germplasm resource revealed considerable variation in flowering time, seed
size, and plant architecture. The inbreeding nature of Brachypodium was confirmed by an
extremely high level of homozygosity in wild plants and a lack of cross-pollination under laboratory
conditions.
Conclusion: Taken together, the inbreeding nature and genotypic diversity observed at individual
locations suggest a significant amount of long-distance seed dispersal. The resources developed in
this study are freely available to the research community and will facilitate experimental
applications based on natural diversity.

Background
The small grass Brachypodium distachyon (Brachypodium)
is fast emerging as a powerful model system to study questions unique to the grasses. Brachypodium possesses the
physical and genomic attributes (small stature, fast generation time, simple growth conditions, small genome, self-

fertile, diploid, annual lifecycle) necessary to be a modern
model organism. A truly tractable model grass is needed
because the extremely powerful model dicot, Arabidopsis
thaliana, cannot be used to answer questions where dicot
and grass biology diverge (e.g. cell wall composition).
Humans derive the majority of their food directly or indi-

rectly from grasses and are projected to use increasing
amounts of energy derived from grasses grown as biofuel
crops. Thus, there is considerable need for a model grass
to facilitate research aimed at improving grasses as grain,
forage and energy crops to supply an ever increasing
human population with food and energy. The emergence
of Brachypodium as a model organism fulfills this need.

seed), BAC libraries, physical maps, methods for ethane
methyl sulfonate and fast neutron mutagenesis, cDNA
libraries, and EST sequences [6,13-15]. In addition, a
high-density genetic linkage map has been constructed
(unpublished) and, most importantly, is the imminent
completion of the whole genome sequence including a
large EST sequencing component to aid annotation.

Brachypodium is a typical grass in terms of architecture
and growth habit [1,2]. Thus, Brachypodium is an excellent functional model for all grasses including the large
perennial grasses like switchgrass and Miscanthus that are
being developed as dedicated energy crops. In this context, the small size (15 cm), compact genome (300 Mb),
and rapid generation time (8 weeks) of Brachypodium
will facilitate the application of modern high-throughput
genomic technologies toward questions relevant to energy
crops. It is particularly important to have a model for
emerging energy crops because their large size, large
genomes and outcrossing nature make the use of many
powerful experimental approaches (mutant screens,
transgenic manipulation, growth under controlled conditions) difficult in these species. Thus, it is not surprising
that the rapid development of numerous tools for Brachypodium is coincident with increased interest in research
topics relevant to the development of grasses as biomass
crops for the sustainable production of biofuels. One
important area of investigation is the unique cell wall of
grasses. In this context, Brachypodium is an excellent system because its cell wall is typical of grasses including
switchgrass and Miscanthus [3]. Thus, knowledge in this
area gained from Brachypodium will be applicable to
energy crops. Brachypodium is closely related to wheat
and the small grains [4-6] and thus, in addition to serving
as a functional genomic model, holds promise as a structural genomic tool to aid the exploration of the huge
genomes found in these crops. Several studies have
already used the closely related species Brachypodium sylvaticum as a tool to aid cloning projects in wheat and barley [7-9].

Missing from the list of Brachypodium resources is a large
collection of diverse inbred lines and genetic markers.
There are currently only six freely available inbred diploid
lines [12,15]. Some additional collections have been
made, but are available only under a restrictive material
transfer agreement [1]. A diverse collection of well
described, freely available inbred lines is essential to allow
Brachypodium to be used to study natural variation, and
to allow positional cloning of induced mutations. Genetic
markers are essential for many experiments including
positional cloning, mapping quantitative trait loci, association mapping, ECOTILLING and analysis of genotypic
diversity in populations. PCR-based markers are particularly useful because they are fast, easy to score and can be
used by any lab with standard molecular biology tools.
Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs), also known as microsatellites, are genomic areas with simple short repeat units.
The number of repeats in these regions is highly polymorphic and thus markers developed from SSRs are particularly powerful. Both markers and a diverse collection of
inbred lines are necessary for Brachypodium to reach its
full potential as a model system. We addressed these
needs by developing SSR markers and creating inbred
lines from a diverse collection of Brachypodium accessions collected from 53 locations throughout Turkey.

In addition to serving as a traditional model, Brachypodium is an excellent test-bed for transgenic approaches in
the grasses because of an extremely efficient Agrobacterium-mediated transformation system and a rapid generation time. We currently obtain average transformation
efficiencies over 50% for high-throughput production of
T-DNA tagged lines (unpublished) and efficiencies ranging from 30–80% have been reported by three groups [1012]. (see http://brachypodium.pw.usda.gov/ for a variety
of up-to-date protocols). Other experimental resources
that have been developed or are under development to
enable Brachypodium to be used as a model organism
include: identification of growth conditions that allow
rapid generation times (as fast as 8 weeks from seed to

Results
SSR identification and initial survey of polymorphism
In total, 1,166 SSRs were identified (519 from 20,440
ESTs and 647 from 44,952 BES) using cutoff values of six
repeats for dinucleotide repeats, five repeats for trinucleotide repeats, and four repeats for tetranucleotide repeats.
The most common repeat from the ESTs was the trinucleotide repeat CCG which comprised 36% of all ESTderived SSRs and the most common repeat from the BES
was the dinucleotide repeat GA which comprised 40% of
all BES-derived repeats (Figure 1). The higher percentage
of trinucleotide repeats in the ESTs suggests that many EST
SSRs are constrained by being in coding regions.

To identify robust, polymorphic markers for population
studies we determined the level of SSR polymorphism in
a small collection of six Brachypodium lines (Bd1-1, Bd23, Bd3-1 Bd18-1, Bd21, Bd21-3) using 621 primer pairs
(144 from ESTs and 477 from BES) (additional file 1).
Out of the 621 primer pairs tested, 398 (64%) produced
strong bands. Of those, 261 (66%) primer pairs identified

polymorphisms between at least two of the six lines. As
has been observed in other systems, SSRs with more
repeats were more polymorphic than SSRs with fewer
repeats. For example, SSRs with five repeat units had an
average of 1.5 alleles whereas SSRs with 13 or more
repeats had 3.2 alleles. The diversity of SSR alleles found
in this initial population indicates that there is sufficient
SSR diversity to use SSR markers for mapping or population analysis. Full details of product sizes for all markers
are presented in additional file 2.
Collection of new accessions and creation of inbred lines
Two new collections of Brachypodium accessions were
used in this study. The first collection was made by MT
between June 6 and July 10, 2006 from eight locations in
Turkey (Figure 2). For three locations (Adiyaman,
Gaziantep, Tekirdag) an area of ~10,000 m2 was sampled
by collecting seed from individual plants scattered across
the site. Bulk collections of several plants at different subsites were also made. Inbred lines were made from each of
the different individual plants that were collected. From
five sites (Balli, Bismil, Iskenderun, Kahta, Kozluk) only
one bulk collection from plants growing in small area of
a few square meters was made. For these locations eight
inbred lines were made by sub-sampling the bulk seed. All
sites except Tekirdag were overgrazed hilly pasture with
continental climate (very dry with hot summers and cold
winters). Tekirdag lies near the Marmara Sea and so has a
more maritime climate (higher humidity, more precipitation, relatively cooler summer and warmer winters). The
Tekirdag site is also forested and so was shaded and not
subject to grazing. The 84 inbred lines developed from
material collected by MT were named using the first three
letters of a nearby town as the prefix. The locations and
other details of these collections are summarized in additional file 3. These lines were inbred for two generations.

The second collection was made independently by HB in
2006 from 45 locations across Turkey (Figure 2). Full
details of these collections, the development of inbred
lines and phenotypic analysis will be published elsewhere. One hundred twenty one inbred diploid lines
from this collection were used in the present study (additional file 3). These inbred lines were placed into 13 phenotypic groups and the naming convention consists of the
group prefix (e.g. BdTR1) followed by a unique letter for
each inbred line. The phenotypic groups BdTR4 and
BdTR6 were polyploid and were not included in the
present study. For this collection it is important to note
that lines with the same prefix (e.g. BdTR1a and BdTR1e)
do not necessarily come from the same location (additional file 3). In addition to the new collections, six previously described inbred lines, Bd1-1, Bd2-3, Bd3-1, Bd181, Bd21 and Bd21-3 were also used [12,15].
Phenotypic characterization
For the inbred lines developed from material collected by
MT, we examined flowering time, vernalization requirements, seed size and presence of hairs on the lemma. This
phenotypic analysis focused on easily scored phenotypes
in order to determine if there was major phenotypic diversity in the collection. It is not intended to be an exhaustive
examination of phenotype by environment interaction
but rather to provide a resource to allow users to select
lines with potentially useful variation in traits of interest.
Flowering time was highly dependent upon the length of
vernalization (additional file 4). All the lines required
longer vernalization times to induce flowering than Bd21,
Bd21-3, Bd2-3 or Bd3-1. Four or five weeks of vernalization was sufficient to induce rapid flowering in all lines
except those from Tekirdag. The lines from Tekirdag
required much longer vernalization times from 8–16
weeks. Growth under long day conditions (20 hr light: 4
hr dark) has previously been shown to promote the flow-

ering of Bd21, Bd21-3, Bd2-3 and Bd3-1 in the absence of
vernalization [12,15]. However, these long day conditions failed to induce rapid flowering of any of the material collected by MT or HB.
Seed size ranged from 2.5 to 5.9 mg/seed for the diploid
lines. The average seed size was 4.1 mg/seed (additional
file 5). There were significant differences between the
average seed sizes from the different populations
(ANOVA, p-value = 0.001). Most of this difference was
due to the smaller seed size of the lines from Tekirdag. The
average seed size of the lines from Tekirdag (3.3 mg/seed)
was significantly (t-test, p-value = 0.003) less than the
average seeds size of the lines from all other locations (4.3
mg/seed). The lines from Tekirdag had short hairs on their
lemmas and appeared smooth whereas most other lines
had very hairy lemmas (Figure 3). Bd18-1 seeds had short
hairs similar to the Tek lines. Bd18-1 also requires a long
vernalization similar to the Tek lines. One line, Koz-3 had
no visible hairs on the lemma (Figure 3). We also
observed variation in the number of inflorescence
branches, number of seeds per branch, and the angle of
the seeds and branches (Figure 3). It should be noted that
the number of branches produced by a given line is highly
dependent upon vernalization. Therefore, only lines
grown under the same conditions and vernalized such
that they flower at the same size can be compared. Longer
vernalization times lead to fewer branches, fewer tillers
and lower seed production.
Ploidy was determined by flow cytometry [16]. For the
material collected by MT, c-values from representatives of
each population were determined first. Later, representative inbred lines were tested to confirm initial results. Five
locations contained only diploid accessions, two locations had only polyploid accessions and one location had
both diploid and polyploid plants (Table 1). One inbred
line, Adi-P1, appeared phenotypically polyploid, but was
collected from a location where c-values from population
samples indicated diploidy. Flow cytometry of Adi-P1
confirmed that it was indeed polyploid while other inbred
lines from Adiyaman were diploid (Table 1).
While ploidy level in some grass species (e.g. buffalograss)
cannot be distinguished visually [17], in Brachypodium
when grown side by side polyploid lines were easily distinguished from diploid lines by visual examination (Figure 4). Two forms of polyploids were apparent. One form
typified by Adi-P1, lines from Balli, and BdTR6 lines has
much larger seeds. For example, Adi-P1 has an average
seed size of 10.1 mg, much larger than the 4.1 mg/seed
average for all diploid lines (additional file 5). This form
also had much thicker and hairier stems (Figure 4). The
other form typified by lines from Iskenderun and BdTR4
lines had seeds similar in size to diploid seeds, but with a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/88

more pronounced crease (Figure 4). These polyploid lines
also tended to bear more seeds per spike, though this trait
is variable depending upon the conditions. Another difference between polyploid and diploid lines is the degree
to which anthers exert. Anthers from flowers of both polyploid forms often exert whereas, under our conditions,
anthers rarely exert from diploid flowers.
SSR analysis and inbreeding
Based on our initial survey of SSR sizes in six inbred
Bd_lines, we selected 43 SSR markers that produced
robust bands and were highly polymorphic among the
Bd_collection to genotype the entire collection (Table 2).
The number of alleles per marker ranged from three to 24
to and the average number of alleles was 10.2 (Table 2).
Summary statistics for the markers are presented in additional file 6 and all the SSR sizes are presented in additional file 7. Out of the 8,041 genotypes determined, only
four heterozygous plants that were each heterozygous for
one marker were found. This indicates that the lines are
highly inbred. To determine the prevalence of Brachypodium self pollination in the wild, for 62 of the lines we
genotyped the first plant to be grown under greenhouse
conditions. Since these plants had undergone no inbreeding in the lab they are representative of wild plants. These
'wild' plants were overwhelmingly homozygous. In fact,
only one marker from one plant was heterozygous. There
was an average of 1.9 alleles per marker per population in
this sample. Therefore, if there was a significant amount of
outcrossing, we would have seen many more heterozygous individuals. This indicates that Brachypodium is
primarily a selfing species under field conditions. In further support of Brachypodium's inbreeding nature, we
have observed that diploid flowers rarely open under our
greenhouse and growth chamber conditions. Under certain environmental conditions (warm and humid in full
sun) we have observed open flowers on diploid plants
grown outside. However, inspection of these open flowers
revealed that the anthers had already dehisced on the stigmas under the fold of the palea. Thus, even open flowers
are expected to produce an overwhelming proportion of
self pollinations. Due to the high degree of homozygosity
we stopped inbreeding the lines developed from MT collections after only two single seed descent generations
under laboratory conditions.

To determine the rate of outcrossing under laboratory
conditions, we monitored the rate at which pollen from
transgenic plants containing a constitutively expressed
GUS reporter gene pollinated wild-type plants. To maximize the chance for cross-pollination, we surrounded single wild-type plants with 10–20 transgenic plants in a
single 15 cm pot and tied the plants together as they grew
in order to bring the flowers into close proximity. To
determine how often transgenic pollen fertilized non-

other functions in PowerMarker. In all cases, the two main
groups and small subgroups with good bootstrap support
were apparent (not shown).

transgenic ovules, we scored the progeny of the wild-type
plants for expression of the GUS reporter gene. Out of
2,233 progeny (1,494 from growth chamber grown plants
and 739 from greenhouse grown plants) from 25 wildtype plants none expressed GUS. This indicates that the
rate of outcrossing under 'worst case' laboratory conditions is exceedingly small.
To determine the relationship between inbred lines we
constructed a consensus neighbor-joining tree based on
100 shared allele bootstrap trees. An examination of the
tree reveals two main groups with high bootstrap support
(Figure 5 and additional file 8). One group consists of
lines from Tekirdag, Bd1-1 and the BdTR7 and BdTR8
groups. These lines are also naturally grouped by their
smaller seeds, longer vernalization requirements and
nearly hairless lemmas (additional file 4 and additional
file 5). The other group consists of all the other lines from
Turkey and Iraq. This large group branches into smaller
groups, however there is little bootstrap support for the
larger branches. There are, however, smaller subgroups
with very high bootstrap support. One striking feature is
that the 11 BdTR groupings form very tight clusters despite
being collected from different locations. Conversely, lines
collected from Adiyaman, Gaziantep and Kahta fall into
several different groups. In addition to the shared allele

The successful implementation of Brachypodium as a
model for the study of natural diversity and the positional
cloning of induced mutations is dependent upon the phenotypic and genotypic diversity found within the species.
Brachypodium occupies a variety of habitats including
hot interior regions, cooler coastal areas and colder
mountainous regions suggesting the existence of considerable genetic diversity. The natural range of Brachypodium
is centered around the Mediterranean extending north
into Europe and south into the Indian subcontinent [2].
Within this region, Turkey is expected to be a rich source
of Brachypodium diversity because it covers all the habitats mentioned above. Therefore, we have sampled this
region heavily (Figure 2). Our results clearly indicate that
there is sufficient phenotypic and genotypic diversity
within this Brachypodium collection to facilitate studies
of natural diversity and allow efficient positional cloning
of induced mutations. We had no difficulties identifying
polymorphic SSR markers and noted significant differences in easily scored phenotypes like seed size, vernalization requirements, inflorescence architecture and the
presence of hairs. This agrees with other groups who have
noted diversity in various traits including disease resistance [1,18].
The extremely high degree of homozygosity observed in
wild Brachypodium plants indicates that Brachypodium
is primarily a selfing species. This is not surprising because
as we and others have observed, pollination typically
occurs in a closed flower [19]. From a practical perspective, inbreeding simplifies the maintenance of pure lines
under laboratory conditions. Indeed, our analysis of pollen flow suggests that even under a 'worst case' scenario it
is easy to maintain pure lines. It also means that wild collections do not need to be inbred for many generations to
achieve a high degree of homozygosity.
The consensus tree based on SSR polymorphisms clearly
shows two major groups with very high bootstrap support
(Figure 5). The smaller group containing the Tek lines
shared several phenotypic traits including: long vernalization requirements, seed size, and near absence of hairs on
the lemmas. The larger group contained lines from Turkey
and Iraq. Within this group were tight clusters that contained all the lines from the different BdTR groups that
were previously grouped together based on phenotypic
similarity. Thus, there was remarkable correlation
between the phenotypic groupings and the SSR profiles.
Two lines of particular interest, Bd21 the line whose

genome was sequenced and Bd21-3 a line that is efficiently transformed were found to be more closely related
to one another than to any other line, but they are clearly
distinct. The diversity of homozygous genotypes found
within very small areas suggests that considerable longdistance seed dispersal takes place. This is consistent with
the presence of hairs on the firmly attached lemmas of
most lines. These hairs aid seed dispersal by animals and
humans. The lack of bootstrap support for the major
branches in the largest group suggests that, despite being
primarily inbreeding, there is substantial genetic exchange
over longer timescales.

Conclusion
In this study we have demonstrated that considerable genotypic and phenotypic variation exists within this Brachypodium collection. This diversity will allow scientific
methods that exploit natural diversity to be applied to
Brachypodium. The geographic distribution of SSR genotypes suggests that long-distance seed dispersal plays a significant role in the population structure of
Brachypodium. The SSR markers and inbred lines developed in this study are a significant contribution to the
Brachypodium resources already available and are freely
available to the scientific community.

Methods
Identification of SSRs and primer design
SSRs were identified and flanking primers designed essentially as previously described [20]. Briefly, 20,440 ESTs
and 44,952 BES generated previously [4,6,13] were analyzed with SSRIT to identify SSRs with at least six unit
repeats for dinucleotide repeats, five unit repeats for trinucleotide repeats and four unit repeats for tetranucleotide
repeats [21]. Primers flanking the SSRs were designed
using BatchPrimer 3 [22]. An M13 primer sequence was
added to the forward primer to allow detection with a

and 18°C at night with supplemental lighting to extend
daylength to 16 hours.

DNA extraction and fragment size detection
DNA was extracted from approximately 0.5 g of leaf tissue
as described [23]. The polymerase chain reactions (PCR)
were carried out in a final volume of 7.5 μl on an MJ
Research PTC-225 thermocycler with a thermal profile
consisting of a 2-min initial denaturation step at 95°C followed by 35 cycles of 20 s at 95°C, 20 s at 54°C and 1 min
at 72°C. A final 72°C extension step of 30 min was
included to promote non-templated nucleotide addition
at the 3'end of the PCR product. Reactions were carried
out in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.0 at 25°C), 50 mM KCl,
0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1% BSA, 1%
PVP-40, 200 μM dNTPs in the presence of 0.5 U Taq
polymerase, 11.25 ng genomic DNA, 0.5 μM marker-specific reverse primer, 0.033 μM markers-specific M13-tailed
forward primer and 0.5 μm VIC- or FAM-labeled M13
primer. PCR products were precipitated with PEG and run
on an ABI 3730xl along with PET-labeled size standards of
133–433 bp as described [20].

Seeds were sown in a soilless mix (supersoil, Rod McLellan Co., Marysville, OH) and fertilized once at planting
with a time release fertilizer containing micronutrients
(Osmocote Plus 15-9-12, Scotts Co., Marysville, OH). To
test the effect of vernalization times on flowering, planted
pots were placed at 4°C for the desired number of weeks
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 16 weeks). While in the cold, pots were
continuously illuminated by cool white fluorescent
lamps. The vernalization experiment was conducted once
in a greenhouse and once in a growth chamber. For each
treatment there were six plants in each pot and one pot for
each genotype. The Tek lines, were only subjected to 16
weeks of vernalization because preliminary trials indicated that the plants did not flower after 8 weeks of vernalization.

Plant growth conditions and phenotypic analysis
Plants were grown in both growth chambers and a greenhouse as previously described [12]. Briefly, for growth
chamber experiments the conditions were 20 hr light: 4 hr
dark photoperiod with cool-white fluorescent lighting at
a level of 150 μEm-2s-1. For greenhouse experiments there
was no shading, temperature range was 24°C in the day

Pollen flow analysis
To determine the rate of pollen flow under growth chamber and greenhouse conditions, we monitored cross pollination between transgenic and non-transgenic
Brachypodium plants. Single wild-type Bd21-3 plants
were planted in the center of 15 cm pots and surrounded
by 10–20 transgenic Bd21-3 plants. To maximize the
potential for pollen flow the plants were tied together
such that the flowers from the transgenic plants were
touching the wild-type plants. The transgenic line was
homozygous for a pOL001 T-DNA insertion that segregated as a single genetic locus. pOL001 contains a GUS

Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic analysis. Unrooted neighbor joining consensus tree of 187 lines based on 100 shared allele bootstrap trees
constructed using 43 SSR markers. Bootstrap values greater than 20 are presented for major branches. For clarity, where several lines formed a tight cluster only the number of lines and color-coded line prefixes are displayed. Note that the lines fall
into two main groups supported by very high bootstrap support. The lines in the red circle share a number of phenotypic characters (small seeds, hairless lemmas, long vernalization requirements). The other group contains all the other lines from Turkey and Iraq. The major branches in this group have little bootstrap support. Smaller branches with good bootstrap support
group the BdTR lines. Additional file 8 shows the same tree as a rectangular phylogram in which all line labels can be read.

reporter gene driven by a constitutive maize ubiquitin promoter [15]. The seeds produced by the wild-type plant
were planted and the seedlings tested for GUS activity by
histochemical staining.
Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic trees were constructed using several different
functions (i.e. shared allele, log shared allele, Euclidean,

Reynolds 1983, Nei 1973, Nei 1983, Goldstein 1995,
Shriver 1995) within the PowerMarker program [24].
Bootstrapping was carried out using the bootstrap function in PowerMarker and consensus trees were created
using the consense program found the PHYLIP software
package
v3.68

phylip.html. Frequency based distances were assigned to
the consensus tree using FITCH (in PHYLIP package). The
