maintains infectivity of mouse erythrocytes
inducing cerebral malaria

Abstract
Background: Infection with Plasmodium berghei is a widely used model of murine malaria and a powerful tool for
reverse genetic and pathogenesis studies. However, the efficacy of in vitro reinvasion of erythrocytes is generally
low, limiting in vitro studies.
Methods: Plasmodium berghei ANKA-infected blood obtained from a susceptible infected mouse was cultured in
various conditions and in vitro parasitaemia was measured every day to evaluate the rate of reinvasion.
Results: High quality culture media were used and reinvasion rates were improved by vigorous orbital shaking of
the flask and increasing density of the medium with gelatin.
Discussion: Using these settings, reinvasion of normal mouse erythrocytes by the parasite was obtained in vitro
over two weeks with preservation of the infectivity in vivo.

Background
Plasmodium berghei is an African murine malaria parasite isolated by Vincke and Bafort in Katanga (PbNK for
New York-Katanga) and in Kasapa (PbANKA for
Antwerpen-Kasapa) [1,2]. During natural infection, the
blood stages of the parasite undergo asynchronous
development with a haploid cycle of 22 hours. Their
preference for immature red blood cells (RBC) [1,3,4]
suggests that they belong to the “vivax group”. The
gametocyte production is intense, with 20% of merozoites of each asexual cycle developing into gametocytes
within 24 hours in phenylhydrazine-treated mice.
Despite the phylogenetic distance, the conservation of
housekeeping genes and of biochemical as well as
genetic processes between human and murine parasites
provided the first justification for their use in malaria
research. Infection of mice with Plasmodium berghei
and Plasmodium yoelii established the first murine models of malaria, with early studies utilizing these models
to test drug efficacy (the Peter’s model).

The first attempt to maintain the parasite in vitro was
performed by serial passages through rats and tissue culture. These passages were associated with a sharp
decrease in the virulence of the parasite in vivo [5].
Early studies developed culture conditions, which permitted the combination of in vivo and in vitro experiments with the same parasites [4-6], and methods for in
vitro culture of gametocytes were rapidly described.
Liver stages of P. berghei were obtained in the HepG2
cell line, which made it possible to study prophylactic
drug efficacy [7]. In vitro development of Plasmodium
ookinetes was achieved later on, followed by a complete
in vitro development of mosquito phases. Several strains
with the same genetic background [8] have been derived
from the original isolates with different sensitivity to
drugs. They are used for drug testing in maturation
assays, molecular studies or evaluation of vaccine efficacy. Selection of mouse strains with various degrees of
sensitivity for the parasite paved the way for analysis of
the pathophysiology of cerebral malaria (CM) [9,10] and
of severe anemia [11].
A new area of interest opened up with the establishment of protocols to knock-out specific genes in the
parasite to investigate gene function. However, these
reverse genetic studies (reviewed by [12]) are still

limited by i) a weak transfection efficiency between 10-3
to 10-4 whereas efficiency reach 10-2 in Toxoplasma gondii), ii) the limited number of markers available to counter select transfectants iii) the mechanism of integration
of foreign DNA (nearly always through homologous
recombination), and iv) by the time required to select
transfected parasites. Indeed the pyrimethamine treatment required to select transfectants is usually performed only 10 to 15 days after injection of the parasite
into mice. Using these methods GFP fluorescent parasites were obtained, which created new areas of application. Maintaining parasites in vitro for a long period of
time would allow selection of transfectants in vitro. This
could pave the way for in vitro studies and facilitate
infection of mice by these parasites by reducing competition between wild and mutated parasites in the mouse.

Methods
Maintenance of Plasmodium berghei

The P. berghei ANKA (PbA) strain was obtained from
Josef Bafort and maintained [9] by successive infection of
CBA/Ca and C57BL/6 mice. Each mouse was inoculated
with 106 IRBC intra-peritoneally [10]. For each culture
condition, mice were bled 7 days post-infection (when
parasitaemia in blood reached more than 8%) and infected
red blood cells (IRBC) were cultured after careful removal
of leukocytes. Freezing of the IRBC in liquid nitrogen was
done in Alsever’s solution, as described [10]. All experiments complied with the Australian guidelines for animal
research and protocol # K20/7-2006/3/4434 was approved
by the University of Sydney Animal Ethics Committee.
Maintenance of in vitro culture

Culture medium was removed daily after centrifugation of
the culture at 600 g for 10 min. The pellet was diluted at
2.5% haematocrit with fresh medium. Non-infected red
blood cells (NRBC) were obtained from healthy mice, and
were added twice a week after platelets had been carefully
removed from the blood by two washes and centrifugation
at 400 g. Buffy coat was removed following Janse et al
[13]. Culture was conducted in 75 cm2 flasks, flushed with
gas (5% CO2, 5% O2, 90% N2) and totally sealed. Effect of
storage at 4°C of NRBC and of IRBC was checked by keeping cells in the fridge during increasing time before seeding. Selection of mature stages of the parasite was
performed on an AutoMacs (Miltenyi Biotec) using the
“sensitive” procedure with IRBC diluted 1:20 in PBS. Duration of the parasite life cycle and identification of the stage
of the parasite in culture were evaluated by repeated
Giemsa-stained thin smears on sampled IRBC.

haemolysis of IRBC in culture, tests were conducted to
adapt the density of the medium and the method of
shaking. Concentrations of fetal calf serum (FCS) from 5
to 20% and gelatin from 0.5 to 5% were tested. IRBC
were added to RPMI1640 medium supplemented by
these components and maintained at 37°C for five days.
Medium was changed daily and haemolysis was checked
optically at each step. In parallel, several ways of agitating the culture were tried, including magnetic stirring
and permanent orbital shaking to minimize haemolysis.
Reinvasion study

Rate of reinvasion was calculated by daily determination
of the parasitaemia in culture, using thin Giemsa-stained
smears. Parasites were counted on 100 fields at ×1, 000
magnification. Reinvasion of newly added red blood cells
by the parasites after several days of culture was experimentally confirmed by labeling of i) NRBC with a green
fluorescent dye (PKH-67, MINI67-IKT, Sigma) prior to
addition to the culture flask and ii) parasites with hydroethidine (red fluorescence). Parasites were labeled by
incubation with hydroethidine for 30 min at 37°C, two
days after the addition of green-NRBC to the culture.
Double-labeled IRBC were observed with a confocal
microscope (Olympus FV1000).
Infectivity experiment

In vivo infectivity of the cultured parasites was evaluated
by inoculating IRBC in susceptible mice (CBA/Ca or
C57BL/6). After 12 days of culture 10 6 IRBCs were
injected intra-peritoneally [10] and parasitaemia was
monitored daily on thin tail vein blood smears from day
5 post-infection onwards..
Final composition of the medium

The final composition of the medium was: RPMI1640 (3/4):
DMEM-F12 (1/4); bicarbonate 32 mM, HEPES 25 mM;
Albumax II 0.5%; glucose 3 g/L; hypoxanthine 200 μM; calcium 2 mM; gelatin 0.1%; choline 1 mM. Chemicals and
dyes were purchased from Sigma, except for AlbuMAX II
(Gibco n°10021-037), DMEM/F12 (with L-glutamine, Invitrogen n°11330), hydroethidine (Polysciences n°17084) and
culture flasks (75 cm2, Corning). Cultures were maintained
at 32°C and medium was changed daily. Fresh mouse
NRBCs were added twice a week (dilution 1:4). Haematocrit was maintained at 2.5%. Culture flasks were maintained
closed and vertical, filled with no more than 30 mL and
gased with a 5% CO2, 5% O2, 90% N2 gas mixture. Permanent shaking at 100 rpm on an orbital shaker was applied.

Results
Stability of the mouse RBC in culture

Stability of red blood cells

Starting culture conditions followed those described by
Mons et al and Janse et al [6,13]. To avoid mild

The stability of mouse RBC in culture was the first parameter that needed improving. As previously described,

mouse IRBC maintained in culture at 37°C [14] presented mild haemolysis. During this study addition of
20% FCS to the medium significantly reduced this haemolysis, but consequently decreased maturation rate of
the parasites after several days of culture. Haemolysis
was totally abolished by addition of gelatin. Along the
same line, permanent orbital shaking of the flask at 100

rpm achieved substantial mechanical disruption of the
late schizonts (Figure 1) without inducing red cell
alterations as seen with the magnetic stirrer. Using this
setting, large numbers of well-separated merozoites
were observed in culture (Figure 1A2) and the position
of the merozoites on the RBC as well as merozoites
inside RBC was readily detected (Figure 1A2).

Merozoite production and reinvasion

In RPMI1640 medium supplemented in the same way as
for Plasmodium falciparum [15], a decrease in the number of merozoites produced by parasites, i.e. the number
of nuclei in schizonts, was observed after three life
cycles of the parasite. This suggested insufficiency in
nutrient levels, which was not overcome by increasing
FCS concentration to more than 5% [13]. Medium composition was modified by addition of DMEM/F12 to
RPMI1640. This medium is also compatible with
endothelial cell culture. Based on the follow up of in
vitro parasitaemia, numerous experiments were conducted, allowing optimization of the culture medium
mixture to one part DMEM/F12 and three parts
RPMI1640. Higher proportion of DMEM/F12 induced a
reduction of the parasitaemia. Similarly, ionic concentration in the medium was adapted in agreement with the
mouse serum concentrations [16]. Addition of calcium
improved their maintenance in culture. Due to a high
rate of parasite multiplication and acidification of the
medium, the bicarbonate concentration was increased
and culture media was changed daily. The temperature
was also decreased to 32°C without apparent change in
the duration of the life cycle of the parasite. Reinvasion

of newly added red blood cell by the parasites was confirmed by dual labeling of NRBC and parasites with
hydroethidine (Figure 1B).
After seeding in culture, parasitaemia could be maintained between 5 to 15% for 5 to 7 days (Figure 2) with
fresh blood being added twice a week. After 12 days most
of the cultures had still 0.5 to 1% parasitaemia despite a
dilution of the IRBC 1:4 with NRBC twice a week. Storage of the normal RBC at 4°C for up to one week before
use in culture had no effect on in vitro invasion. In contrast, storage of the IRBC at 4°C, either before seeding or
after a couple of days of culture, had a dramatic effect on
reinvasion (Figure 2) as already described for merozoites
[17]. In most flasks, gametocyte production was rapidly
observed and associated with a sharp decrease of the
asexual parasitaemia (Figure 2A).
Selection of mature stage of the parasite, from infected
blood was easily obtained using the AutoMacs in the
same conditions as those used for P. falciparum. Following separation, parasitaemia could reach up to 90%.
Infectivity

Infectivity of the cultured parasites for the host was
assessed by re-injecting IRBC in mice either directly

from 6 mice are seeded immediately after bleeding (direct seeding) and 6 after overnight storage at 4°C. Depending on the mouse, some
isolates turned rapidly to gametocyte production (gam). No adjunction of RBC was done in the cultures. B/Follow up of parasitaemia after
seeding of 18 separate isolates Isolates from 9 mice are seeded immediately after bleeding (direct seeding) and 9 after overnight storage of the
infected blood at 4°C (ON). RBC are added after 2 days of culture, as marked by the dotted line (dilution 1:1 RBC:IRBC). After five days of culture
most of the isolates seeded immediately after bleeding still harboured more than 30% of their initial parasitaemia (at the seeding day). After 12
days of culture parasitaemia of the isolates (direct seeding) are usually between 1 to 5% (data not shown). This is a different set of mice from
Figure 2A.

from cultures or after freezing cultured parasites in
liquid nitrogen. Repeated cycles of in vitro culture of
PbA did not affect the infectivity of the parasite for
mice. After 12 days of culture, injection of 106 IRBC in
susceptible CBA/J mice readily induced 2% to 6% of
parasitaemia within 7 days. Mice with high parasitaemia
displayed clear signs of CM.

Discussion
In most protocols, early culture conditions for P. berghei
closely resembled those of P. falciparum [13], as the
maturation of young blood stages into schizonts is
straightforward [18]. Long-term in vitro cultivation of P.
berghei was claimed to be obtained by Ramaiya et al
[18] at 27°C, and by Smalley [14] who achieved a low
multiplication rate at 15°C. However, at 37°C, a decrease
in parasite density was always observed as a consequence of the instability of the red blood cells (RBC).
During all these studies, re-invasion appeared to be the
bottleneck of the long-term cultivation of P. berghei.
This was attributed to two main points: i) a restricted
ability to invade mature RBC, which required adding
blood with a high percentage of reticulocytes to the cultures, and ii) release of merozoites staying packed
together or surrounded by RBC membrane preventing
them from invading new cells. Schizonts can indeed survive for more than 20 hours in culture and most of the
authors used a magnetic stirrer to increase the disruption of the IRBC. During this study, conditions of culture were adjusted to allow an average of 10% in vitro
parasitaemia during the first week after seeding and at
least 0.5 to 1% after 10 days. Mature stages of the parasite were easily purified using the AutoMacs procedure.
Preference of P. berghei for mouse reticulocytes has
been widely reported and in “CM resistant” mice parasitaemia can reach 80% of RBC [10,11] supposed to be
mostly reticulocytes. This has implications for in vitro
studies of drug sensitivity or cell/cell interactions. In
this study, mice used to provide NRBC for culture were
not treated before bleeding to increase reticulocytosis.
Nevertheless their blood allowed regular reinvasion of
RBC by parasites. This protocol for culture of PbAIRBC in vitro provides significant advantages particularly
in allowing in vitro studies of co-culture with endothelial cells or leukocytes in conditions similar to human
malaria. Cultivation of the parasites in this setting does
not induce any loss of infectivity for mice.
