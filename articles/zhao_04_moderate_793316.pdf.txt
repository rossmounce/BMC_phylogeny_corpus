Abstract
Background: The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused a severe global
epidemic in 2003 which led to hundreds of deaths and many thousands of hospitalizations. The virus
causing SARS was identified as a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and multiple genomic sequences
have been revealed since mid-April, 2003. After a quiet summer and fall in 2003, the newly emerged
SARS cases in Asia, particularly the latest cases in China, are reinforcing a wide-spread belief that
the SARS epidemic would strike back. With the understanding that SARS-CoV might be with
humans for years to come, knowledge of the evolutionary mechanism of the SARS-CoV, including
its mutation rate and emergence time, is fundamental to battle this deadly pathogen. To date, the
speed at which the deadly virus evolved in nature and the elapsed time before it was transmitted
to humans remains poorly understood.
Results: Sixteen complete genomic sequences with available clinical histories during the SARS
outbreak were analyzed. After careful examination of multiple-sequence alignment, 114 single
nucleotide variations were identified. To minimize the effects of sequencing errors and additional
mutations during the cell culture, three strategies were applied to estimate the mutation rate by 1)
using the closely related sequences as background controls; 2) adjusting the divergence time for
cell culture; or 3) using the common variants only. The mutation rate in the SARS-CoV genome
was estimated to be 0.80 – 2.38 × 10-3 nucleotide substitution per site per year which is in the same
order of magnitude as other RNA viruses. The non-synonymous and synonymous substitution
rates were estimated to be 1.16 – 3.30 × 10-3 and 1.67 – 4.67 × 10-3 per site per year, respectively.
The most recent common ancestor of the 16 sequences was inferred to be present as early as the
spring of 2002.
Conclusions: The estimated mutation rates in the SARS-CoV using multiple strategies were not
unusual among coronaviruses and moderate compared to those in other RNA viruses. All
estimates of mutation rates led to the inference that the SARS-CoV could have been with humans
in the spring of 2002 without causing a severe epidemic.

Background
The earliest confirmed case of the severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) occurred in November, 2002 in the
Guangdong province of China. Toward the end of the epidemic (as reported by July 31, 2003) there were 8,098 recognized cases in 31 countries or regions worldwide and
774 implicated deaths (WHO, http://www.who.int/csr/
sars/country/table2003_09_23/en/). Due to an unprecedented international effort, the SARS coronavirus (SARSCoV) was identified as the causal agent in late March 2003
and its first complete genomic sequences were published
April 13, 2003 [1,2]. One month later, SARS-like coronaviruses were found in palm civets and other animals in
Guangdong, China, the first evidence of possible interspecies transmission of the virus [3]. The re-emergence of the
isolated SARS cases in Asia in December, 2003 and in
Anhui province and Beijing, China, in late April 2004, has
confirmed a wide-spread conjecture that the SARS-CoV
will likely be with humans for years to come. This reemergence of SARS cases makes it legitimate to critically
re-evaluate the time for the origin of the SARS-CoV.
There are 26 putative coding regions which cover about
98% of the 29.8-kb SARS-CoV genome. Approximately
two-thirds of the genome are at the 5' side encoding the
nonstructural proteins (orf1ab and orf1a) and one-third
are at the 3' side encoding four structural proteins: spike
glycoprotein (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and
nucleocapsid (N) [4]. The spike glycoprotein, especially
its S1 subdomain, is responsible for binding to the specific
receptor in the target cells [4,5]. RNA polymerase and
nsp1 genes are two major loci in orf1ab.
Estimating the mutation rate in RNA viruses and retroviruses is critical but also challenging for tracing their rapidly evolving paths. The rates estimated from the positivestrand ssRNA virus appear to be in a similar range (e.g.,
~10-3 per site per year) from the negative-strand ssRNA
virus, although a direct comparison is not possible
because the mutation rates could be estimated from different regions or genes [6-15]. The estimated mutation
rates in coronavirus, which SARS-CoV phylogenetically
links to, are moderate to high compared to the others in
the category of ssRNA viruses. For example, it was estimated to be 0.3 – 0.6 × 10-2 per site per year in the infectious bronchitis virus in a previous study [8]. However,
the estimated mutation rate appears to have a wider range
in the retrovirus [16-20]. More details are presented in the
Discussion section.
How SARS-CoV evolves has important implications for
both strategic planning in the prevention of SARS epidemics and development of a vaccine and antibodies. The
mutation rate is among the most fundamental aspect of
sequence evolution. If the pathogen evolves slowly, there

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/21

will be a better chance for development of effective long
lasting vaccines and successful treatment for patients from
a particular geographic region will likely be effective for
patients from other areas. On the other hand, if the pathogen (particularly the genes coding for major antigens)
evolves rapidly, an effective strategy to prevent transmission of the SARS-CoV must be the top-priority, and an
effective vaccine program may be problematic. The purpose of this study is to improve our understanding of the
evolutionary mechanism in the SARS-CoV genome, and
in particular to address the issues of the mutation rate and
the time for the emergence of the SARS-CoV in the human
population. We reported the estimated mutation rate in
the SARS-CoV using the available complete genomic
sequences whose clinical history either is certain or could
be inferred.

Results
Mutation rate
The sources of the genomic sequences used in this study
and the methods of estimating mutation rates are presented in the Methods section. The divergence time was
inferred based on the information summarized in Figure
1. Table 1 shows the mutation rates estimated by three
strategies. When the first strategy was used to adjust for
sequencing errors and potential mutations in the cell culture, the mutation rate was estimated to be 0.80 – 2.38 ×
10-3 nucleotide substitution per site per year using all the
sequences not generated from mainland China, and 0.81
– 1.38 × 10-3 nucleotide substitution per site per year
using the TOR2 and Urbani sequences only. When the
second strategy was used, the mutation rate was estimated
to be 0.74 – 1.62 × 10-3 nucleotide substitution per site per
year, which is lower than that from using the first strategy.
As expected, the mutation rate estimated using the third
strategy was the lowest; 0.54 – 1.57 × 10-3 nucleotide substitution per site per year using the 11 sequences not generated from mainland China and 0.42 – 0.72 × 10-3
nucleotide substitution per site per year using the TOR2
and Urbani sequences only.
Substitution rate in the coding regions
For all samples, the proportion of non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site (Ka) was 0.63 × 10-3
and the proportion of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (Ks) was 0.65 × 10-3, leading to Ka/Ks being
0.97. This ratio was 0.79 in the nonstructural region and
1.37 in the structural region. In particular, the values of
Ka/Ks were 1.98 for nsp1 and 0.85 for S.

Table 2 shows the rates of nucleotide substitution in the
coding regions of sequences. The overall rates of non-synonymous and synonymous substitutions were 1.16 – 3.30
× 10-3 and 1.67 – 4.67 × 10-3 per site per year, respectively.

The non-synonymous rate was higher in the three genes E,
M, and N, suggesting some of those mutations might
increase antigenicity, although the number of mutations
used to calculate these rates was small.
Time for the origin of SARS-CoV
The mutation rate estimated earlier allowed us to estimate
the age of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of
the sample, which should be about the same or more

recent than the time for the origin of SARS-CoV. The phylogeny reconstructed by the neighbor-joining method
with mid-point rooting or by maximum parsimony is
overall consistent with the epidemic (Additional file 1).
All the sequences from mainland China clustered together
and separated from the remaining sequences, including
those clinically related to the index patient A. GZ01 was
distantly separated from other sequences. Assuming the
MRCA is the root of the phylogeny, the age of the MRCA

In method 1, the nucleotide difference (3.2) among five Singaporean sequences was used to adjust the sequence errors and mutations that occurred
during cell culture. In method 2, the number of variants between two sequences was reduced by 2 and the divergence time was increased by 14
days. In method 3, the nucleotide variants that were observed only once among the isolates were excluded. t = range of divergence time (days). µ

is then the divergence time between GZ01 and other
sequences. Using the mutation rates estimated above, it is
found that the MRCA could be alive at a time between
March 28 and November 29, 2002 (strategy 1), between
February 22 and October 3, 2002 (strategy 2), and even
earlier (strategy 3). The most critical implication of these
analyses is that it is entirely plausible that the MRCA of the
sample could be alive as early as the spring of 2002.

Discussion
Some uncertainties in the quality of the sequence data and
incomplete information from patient histories are two
limiting factors of this study. The world-wide race to
understand this novel virus has provided an unprecedented set of complete genome sequences of a pathogen
in an interval of a few weeks, but likely side-effects of this
race might be an elevated error rate in the released
sequences and generating errors during the analysis.
Among the 129 sequence variations reported [4], many
were generated randomly by the algorithms during the
alignment of the multiple sequences, therefore these
should be removed or adjusted. The concern above has
led us to wait until all the sequences used in this study
have been significantly revised by their generators and to
manually adjust the multiple-sequence alignment. Still

some errors were unavoidable partly due to the intrinsic
error rate of sequencing technology. For example among
18 common variations, 9 could not be uniquely assigned
to the internal branches of the phylogeny. This incongruence is likely partially due to sequence errors. The existence of sequence errors can also be inferred by examining
the ratio of transitional versus transversional changes. If
nucleotide substitution occurs randomly, there are two
transversional substitutions on average for each transitional substitution, and the ratio of transition to transversion should be 0.5. However, transition is generally
favored over transversion in many organisms. For example, the ratio is approximately 2 in the human genome
[21,22]. The ratio has not been discussed extensively in
the RNA viruses; however, it appears to be higher than
that in the mammalian genomes based on the two previous reports of 3.7 in the influenza A virus [23] and 5.0 in
the Marburg virus [24]. In this study, 60 transitional substitutions and 54 transversional substitutions were
observed among the 16 sequences, thus the ratio was 1.1.
The ratio in five sequences from mainland China was 0.9,
considerably smaller than 2.2 which was observed in the
other eleven sequences. This suggests that sequences from
mainland China may be more erroneous than the other
sequences. On the other hand, the ratio was 0.9 for the

singleton variations, which was much lower than the ratio
of 3.5 for the non-singleton variants. This further indicates that singletons were more problematic.
Because of the unknown level of errors in the sequences,
a conservative approach to estimating the mutation rate
was taken. Three strategies were used to reduce the effect
of sequence errors, one being more aggressive than the
other two. The mutation rates estimated by the first two
strategies were quite similar. In the third strategy, all the
variants unique to a given isolate were excluded. Such a
strategy is very conservative because the amount of singletons is expected to be large in a rapid expanding environment (see below). Therefore the mutation rate was placed
in the range of 0.80 – 2.38 × 10-3 nucleotide substitution
per site per year based on the 11 sequences used. This rate,
along with the rate of synonymous substitutions estimated in this study, is close to that recently reported using
another approach [25]. In comparison to other coronaviruses, this rate is lower than that in the mouse hepatitis
virus, similar to that in the transmissible gastroenteritis
virus, but higher than that in the infectious bronchitis
virus (Table 3) [6-8]. The estimated mutation rate is at the
same order of magnitude as in other RNA viruses, for
example, 2.3 × 10-3 nucleotide substitution per site per
year in the influenza A viruses [12,13]. The estimated
mutation rate in HIV appears to have a wide range
[16,17]. It is likely that the mutation rate in the SARS-CoV
is not higher than that in HIV. Therefore, the SARS-CoV is
not an unusual coronavirus or RNA virus in terms of its

speed of nucleotide changes. One of the challenging tasks,
therefore, is to find those variations which led to the
SARS-CoV being unique from other RNA viruses, especially coronaviruses, and how those variations changed
the functionality and helped to transmit it to humans.
Nucleotide variation is distributed along the entire
genome. Based on our alignment and the annotation in
GenBank, 21 of the 26 open reading frames had the variations, including genes encoding polymerase, spike glycoprotein, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid protein.
The estimated mutation rate suggests that approximately
2 to 6 new mutations will occur each month in a virus
assuming the overall uniform mutation rate. However,
the rate of the non-synonymous substitutions might vary
during the course of the SARS-CoV evolution [25]. It was
observed that there was an excess of mutations (and
amino acid changes) in the external branches of the phylogeny of a large sample of the HA gene sequences of influenza A, which was partially caused by sampling bias [26].
From a population genetics standpoint, a large proportion
of mutations should occur in the external branches when
the infected hosts have rapidly increased. Therefore, one
should not conclude that mutation rate is low because of
a relatively small number of mutations in the internal
branches [27]. Our analysis, even by a conservative estimation of mutation rate, indicates that the SARS-CoV
population has already harbored a considerable amount
of genetic diversity.

Based on the information in National Center for Biotechnology Information http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ on August 31, 2003.

The emerging time of the SARS-CoV is of special importance in dissecting the origin of the virus as well as the
dynamics of the epidemic. The time for the most recent
common ancestor of the 16 isolates was estimated to be
between February 2002 and November 2002. Although
this is consistent with the date for the earliest known case
of SARS and those estimated in other studies [25,28], it
also suggests that SARS-CoV could have been present
longer than generally believed, that is, around November
2002. One possible scenario is that the SARS-CoV had
already infected some people in the spring of 2002 but
failed to cause epidemics; its spread was however suppressed in the summer (similar to the summer of 2003),
and re-emerged around November to cause the epidemic
in 2003. Given the current re-emergence of SARS cases,
this scenario is becoming more likely. There were indeed
some media reports of SARS-like symptoms of patients in
the spring of 2002 although none have been convincingly
confirmed. An alternative scenario is that the common
ancestor of the SARS-CoV lived in the spring of 2002, but
the host was animals. The recent finding of high sequence
homology between the isolate from a newly emerged
SARS case (December 16, 2003) and the isolates from the
masked palm civets [29] makes civets as the primary suspect of reservoir for SARS-CoV.

Conclusions
The estimated mutation rate and the synonymous and
non-synonymous substitution rates in the SARS-CoV
genome were moderate compared to that in coronavirus
and other RNA viruses, suggesting that the SARS-CoV is
not an unusual coronavirus in terms of its speed of nucleotide or amino acid changes. Based on the mutation rates

estimated in this study, the emerging time of the most
recent common ancestor of the 16 isolates can be placed
between February 2002 and November 2002. This suggests that the SARS-CoV could have been with humans as
early as the spring of 2002 without causing a severe epidemic.

Methods
Sequence data
We obtained 16 complete genomic sequences from the
NCBI website http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/. Among
them, five sequences (BJ01-04 and GZ01) were obtained
from the hosts collected in mainland China and the
remaining sequences (TOR2, Urbani, CUHK-W1, CUHKSu10, HKU-39849, five Singaporean sequences, and
TW1) were from the hosts in other geographic regions.
Detailed information of the sequences is shown in Table
4.
Sequence analysis
CLUSTAL X [30], a window-based user interface to the
CLUSTAL W, was used to align the multiple sequences.
The alignment was further manually examined and
adjusted. All gene annotation information and nucleotide
position designations in this study refer to the TOR2
sequence (GenBank accession ID: NC_004718). To avoid
complications, only the single nucleotide variations were
analyzed and all alignment gaps were excluded. This led
to the identification of a total of 114 single nucleotide variations among all the sequences and an average of 18.2
nucleotide differences between two sequences.

The MEGA2 computer program [31] was used to calculate
the pair-wise nucleotide differences. The resulting genetic
distances were corrected by Jukes and Cantor's method
[32]. The phylogeny of the sample was reconstructed
using both neighbor-joining and maximum parsimony
methods [31,33].
Mutation rate can be estimated in principle by the number
of nucleotide differences between two sequences divided
by twice their divergent time, i.e., the time to their most
recent common ancestor. Due to better documented contact histories, mutation rates were estimated only by the
sequences whose hosts were not from mainland China,
that is, sequences TOR2, Urbani, CUHK-W1, CUHKSu10, HKU-39849, five Singaporean sequences, and TW1.
First, the range of the divergence time between each pair
of sequences was inferred based on information on infection history, reported strain isolation dates and sequence
release dates (Additional file 2) [4,34-36]. For example,
the divergence time between isolates TOR2 and Urbani
was estimated to be in the range of 34 to 58 days [35,36].
Second, nucleotide difference between each pair of
sequences was calculated with adjustments to reduce the
effect of sequencing errors and potential mutations during
cell culture. Three strategies were used. The first strategy
was used to reduce the number of pair-wise nucleotide
differences by the averaged number of nucleotide differences observed in five closely related Singaporean
sequences [4]. This strategy effectively assumes that there
is no real nucleotide difference among these five
sequences so that their observed differences reflect the
level of errors. The second strategy was used to reduce the
pair-wise nucleotide difference by two and to add 7 days
to the divergence time to account for cell culture time.
This strategy assumes that the mutation rate during the
cell culture is the same as that in the human host and that
on average the sequencing error is one nucleotide per
genome. In the third strategy, we excluded all the nucleotide variants which had been observed only once (singletons) among the 61 human SARS-CoV sequences reported
in [25]. The rational is that non-singleton mutations
observed in a sample are much less likely due to sequencing errors as well as mutations during the laboratory
passage of virus. This strategy is apparently conservative
and can be regarded as the lower bound of the mutation
rate. Finally, the mutation rate per site per year was estimated by

dij

µ=

∑t

i < j ij

n(n − 1)/ 2

× 365

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/21

where dij is the genetic distance between sequence i and j,
tij is twice their divergence time (in number of days), and
n is the number of sequences.
A mutation in a codon is non-synonymous (or nonsilent) if it changes the amino acid, and is synonymous
(silent) otherwise. The number of non-synonymous
mutations per non-synonymous site (Ka) and the number
of synonymous mutations per synonymous site (Ks) were
computed using the method of Li, Wu, and Luo [37]. The
non-synonymous and synonymous substitution rates
were calculated using the divergence time as estimated
above. Only the second strategy was applied to the rate
estimation because the number of nucleotide differences
used for the adjustment in the first strategy can not be separated for the non-synonymous and synonymous mutations.
