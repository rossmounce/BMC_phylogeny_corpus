Abstract
Background: To date, most fungal phylogenies have been derived from single gene comparisons, or from
concatenated alignments of a small number of genes. The increase in fungal genome sequencing presents
an opportunity to reconstruct evolutionary events using entire genomes. As a tool for future comparative,
phylogenomic and phylogenetic studies, we used both supertrees and concatenated alignments to infer
relationships between 42 species of fungi for which complete genome sequences are available.
Results: A dataset of 345,829 genes was extracted from 42 publicly available fungal genomes. Supertree
methods were employed to derive phylogenies from 4,805 single gene families. We found that the average
consensus supertree method may suffer from long-branch attraction artifacts, while matrix representation
with parsimony (MRP) appears to be immune from these. A genome phylogeny was also reconstructed
from a concatenated alignment of 153 universally distributed orthologs. Our MRP supertree and
concatenated phylogeny are highly congruent. Within the Ascomycota, the sub-phyla Pezizomycotina and
Saccharomycotina were resolved. Both phylogenies infer that the Leotiomycetes are the closest sister
group to the Sordariomycetes. There is some ambiguity regarding the placement of Stagonospora nodurum,
the sole member of the class Dothideomycetes present in the dataset.
Within the Saccharomycotina, a monophyletic clade containing organisms that translate CTG as serine
instead of leucine is evident. There is also strong support for two groups within the CTG clade, one
containing the fully sexual species Candida lusitaniae, Candida guilliermondii and Debaryomyces hansenii, and
the second group containing Candida albicans, Candida dubliniensis, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis and
Lodderomyces elongisporus. The second major clade within the Saccharomycotina contains species whose
genomes have undergone a whole genome duplication (WGD), and their close relatives. We could not
confidently resolve whether Candida glabrata or Saccharomyces castellii lies at the base of the WGD clade.
Conclusion: We have constructed robust phylogenies for fungi based on whole genome analysis. Overall,
our phylogenies provide strong support for the classification of phyla, sub-phyla, classes and orders. We
have resolved the relationship of the classes Leotiomyctes and Sordariomycetes, and have identified two
classes within the CTG clade of the Saccharomycotina that may correlate with sexual status.

Background
Traditional methods of systematics based on morphology
of vegetative cells, sexual states, physiological responses to
fermentation and growth tests can assign fungal species to
particular genera and families. However, higher-level relationships amongst these groups are less certain and are
best elucidated using molecular techniques. Today singlegene phylogenies (especially 18S ribosomal DNA-based
ones) have established many of the accepted relationships
between fungal organisms. The benefits of the 18S rDNA
approach are the vertical transmission of this gene, its
ubiquity and the fact that it has slowly evolving sites.
However, single-gene analyses are dependent on the gene
having an evolutionary history that reflects that of the
entire organism, an assumption that is not always true. It
has been estimated that there are approximately 1.42 million fungi species yet to be discovered [1,2]. It follows that
it is essential that we develop methods to infer a robust
phylogeny of known taxonomic groups, so we can provide a framework for future studies.
Between 1990 and 2003, 560 fungal research papers
reporting phylogenies were published, of which about
84% were derived using rDNA [3]. Protein coding genes
are rarely used in fungal phylogenetics but when used they
have the ability to resolve deep level phylogenetic relationships [4]. Phylogeny reconstruction based on a single
gene may not be robust, as vital physiological processes
and basic adaptive strategies do not always correlate with
ribosomal derived trees [5]. Individual genes also contain
a limited number of nucleotide sites and therefore limited
resolution. An alternative approach to a single gene phylogeny is to combine all available phylogenetic data. There
are two commonly used methods to do this: multigene
concatenation and supertree analysis.
Multigene concatenation proposes that phylogenetic
analysis should always be performed using all available
character data, essentially sticking many aligned genes
together to give a large alignment. Combining the data
increases its informativeness, helps resolve nodes, basal
branching and improve phylogenetic accuracy [6]. Gene
concatenation has been justified on philosophical
grounds, as it attempts to maximise the informativeness
and explanatory power of the character data used in the
analysis [7]. Numerous genome phylogenies have been
derived by concatenation of universally distributed genes
[8-13]. One advantage of concatenated phylogenies is that
observed branch lengths are comparable across the entire
tree, as they are derived from common proteins. This
allows an objective, quantitative analysis of the consistency of traditional groupings [8]. However, gene concatenation also has some well-documented problems. For
example, erroneous phylogenetic inferences can be made
if recombination has occurred within the individual data-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/99

sets used. Phylogenetic inference from sequence data can
also be misled by systematic errors (e.g. compositional
biases) [14]. These errors can be exacerbated when longer
sequences are used, leading to strong support for inferences that in reality may be false.
A supertree analysis on the other hand generates a phylogeny from a set of input trees that possess fully or partially
overlapping sets of taxa. Because the input trees need only
overlap minimally, each source tree must share at least
two taxa with one other source tree; more generally, supertree methods take as input a set of phylogenetic trees and
return one or more phylogenetic trees that represent the
input trees [15]. Because of the way supertrees summarise
taxonomic congruence, they limit the impact of individual genes on the global topology and account for extensive differences in evolutionary rates and substitution
patterns among genes in a gene-by-gene manner [16].
Therefore, we can get a phylogeny that is truly representative of the entire genome. Supertree techniques are slowly
becoming commonplace in biology [17-22] and will play
an important role in ascertaining the tree of life.
This study undertook a phylogenomic approach [23,24]
to fungal taxonomy. Using both supertree and concatenated methods, all available fungal genomic data was
analysed in an effort to address some long-standing questions regarding ancestry and sister group relationships
amongst diverse fungal species.

Results and discussion
Genome data infers a robust fungal phylogeny
Our dataset consisted of 345,829 protein-coding genes
from 42 fungal genomes (Table 1). Overall we identified
4,805 putative orthologous gene families (see methods).
Maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenies were reconstructed for individual gene families. These 4,805 trees
were used as input data for our supertree analysis, constructed using three different methods: matrix representation with parsimony (MRP) [25,26], the average
consensus method (AV) [27], and the most similar supertree analysis (MSSA) method [21]. All three methods
inferred congruent phylogenies, all supertree results discussed here are based on the MRP and AV phylogenies
(Figure 1A&B). The results for the MSSA supertrees can be
found in additional material [see additional file 1]. The
YAPTP (yet another permutation tail probability randomization) test [21], which tests the null hypothesis that
congruence between the input trees is no better than random, was used to assess the degree of congruence between
input trees. The distribution of the scores of the 100 optimal supertrees from the YAPTP test is between 84,184 –
84,464, whereas the original unpermuted data received a
score of 27,686. These scores suggested that congruence
across the input trees is greater than expected by chance (P

> 0.01) [21,22] and we deemed the data suitable for
supertree analyses.
Presently there is a heated philosophical debate as to what
is the best approach for reconstructing genome phylogenies. Instead of using supertree methods, some prefer to
concatenate universally distributed genes. In an attempt
to circumvent this argument we decided to use a global
congruence [28] approach, where both ideologies are
used and the resulting phylogenies are cross-corroborated.
From our analysis, we initially located 227 protein families that were universally distributed between all taxa.
Seven of the genomes present in this analysis have undergone a genome duplication. In an effort to minimize the
effects of hidden paralogy, we only considered genes that
were found in conserved syntenic blocks for selected
organisms (see methods). Overall 153 of the 227 gene
families met these criteria, and were used for further analysis [see additional file 2]. These gene families were individually aligned and concatenated together to give an
alignment of exactly 38,000 amino acids in length. A ML
phylogeny was reconstructed (Figure 2) and compared to
the supertree derived from 4,805 gene families (Figure 1).
In the following discussion we use the phylum, sub-phylum and class taxonomic scheme of the NCBI taxonomy
browser [29].
Overall, there is a high degree of congruence between
supertree and concatenated alignment phylogenies (Figures 1 &2). Unsurprisingly all phylogenies inferred 3
strongly supported phyla branches, the Zygomycota, the
Basidiomycota and the Ascomycota (Figures 1 &2).
The Basidiomycota form a well-supported clade. The three
members of the Hymenomycetes class form a robust subgroup with 100% bootstrap support (BP). Within the
Hymenomycetes there is a clade containing the two members {Coprinus cinereus and Phanerochaete chrysosporium}
of the order Agaricales, separate from Cryptococcus neoformans, which belongs to the order Tremellales.
The majority of the species studied in this analysis belong
to the Ascomycota phylum. Within the Ascomycota there
are two main subphyla, the Pezizomycotina and Saccharomycotina. Both these groups form separate well-supported
sub-phyla
clades
(Figures
1
&2).
Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the only member of the
Schizosaccharomycetes, sits outside these two sub-phyla
clades.
Within the Pezizomycotina a number of well-defined
class-clades are observed, namely the Sordariomycetes,
the Leotiomycetes and Eurotiomycetes (Figures 1 &2). The

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/99

relationship between these classes has been the subject of
debate. Our supertrees and concatenated phylogenies
infer that the Leotiomycetes and Sordariomycetes are sister classes. This agrees with the poorly supported rDNA
based analysis of Lumbsch et al [30] but is in disagreement with Lutzoni et al [3], who based on a four gene
combined dataset placed the Dothideomycetes as a sister
group to the Sordariomycetes. The grouping of Leotiomycetes and Sordariomycetes in both our phylogenies is
highly supported (100% BP) and is likely to represent the
true relationship. Furthermore, a recent phylogenomic
study of 17 Ascomycota genomes by Robbertse et al [12]
reported similar inferences.
There is conflict however between our supertrees and concatenated phylogenies regarding the positioning of Stagonospora nodorum (the only representative of the
Dothideomycetes lineage). The supertrees (Figure 1) place
S. nodorum beside the Eurotiomycetes (100% BP), and
supports the analysis of Lutzoni et al [3] who also group
the Dothideomycetes and Eurotiomycetes lineages
together. Conversely, our concatenated alignment (Figure
2) infers that S. nodorum is more closely related to the Sordariomycetes and Leotiomycetes lineages (100% BP).
Based on their concatenated alignment Robbertse et al
[12] have also reported conflicting inferences regarding
the phylogenetic position of S. nodorum [12]. Their phylogenies reconstructed using neighbor joining and maximum likelihood methods inferred a sister group
relationship between S. nodorum and Eurotiomycetes in
line with our supertree inference. However a phylogeny
inferred using maximum parsimony placed S. nodorum at
the base of the Pezizomycotina [12]. To confidently
resolve this incongruence additional Dothideomycetes
genomes will be required.
Within the Eurotiomycetes class there is a clade corresponding to the order Onygenales {Histoplasma capsulatum, Coccidioides immitis and Uncinocarpus reesii}. The
Onygenales clade is of interest as it contains Coccidioides
immitis. This organism was initially classified as a protist
[31] but further research showed it was fungal, and separate studies placed it in three different divisions of Eumycota [32-34]. Subsequent ribosomal phylogeny studies
[35,36] suggested a close phylogenetic relationship
between C. immitis and U. reesii to the exclusion of H. capsulatum. Our supertrees and concatenated phylogenies
based on whole genome data concur with the placement
of C. immitis and U. reesii as sister taxa.
The Eurotiomycetes branch containing the Aspergillus
clade is also of interest, as supertree and concatenated
phylogenies infer that A. oryzae and A. terreus are each others closest relatives (Figures 1 &2) (100% BP respectively).
A minor difference between the supertrees and concate-

MRP (A) and AV (B) fungal supertrees derived from 4,805 fungal gene families. Bootstrap scores for all nodes are
displayed. The AV supertree method makes use of input tree branch lengths. Rhizopus oryzae has been selected as an outgroup.
The Basidiomycota and Ascomycota phyla form distinct clades. Subphyla and class clades are highlighted. Two clades of special
interest include the node that contains the organisms that translate CTG as serine instead of leucine, and the node that contains the genomes that have undergone a genome duplication (WGD). Topological differences between supertree phylogenies
are highlighted in red font.

nated phylogenies regards the phylogenetic position of A.
nidulans and A. fumigatus. The concatenated alignment
infers that these organisms are sister taxa (100% BP), the
supertrees fails to make this inference and instead positions A. fumigatus beside the {A. oryzae, A. terreus} clade
with 100% BP.
A number of subclass clades are evident in the Sordariomycetes clade. For example Fusarium graminearum, Fusarium verticilliodes and Trichoderma reesei belong to the
subclass Hypocreomycetidae. Similarily Neurospora crassa,
Chaetomium globosum and Podospora anserina all belong to
the subclass Sordariomycetidae. The inferred phylogenetic relationships amongst the Sordariomycetidae organisms concurs with previous phylogenetic studies [37].
Relationships within the Saccharomycotina lineage
Overall the MRP and AV supertree topologies (Figure
1A&B) are very similar. A noticeable difference occurs in
the branch directly adjacent to the WGD clade. The MRP
tree (and the concatenated phylogeny (Figure 2)) places

the grouping of {K. waltii, S. kluyveri} and {K. lactis, A. gossypii} as sister branches, while the AV supertree infers that
{K. waltii, S. kluyveri} are closer to the WGD clade than to
the {K. lactis, A. gossypii} clade. Recently Jeffroy et al [38]
constructed a multigene phylogeny (using 13 of the 42
species included in our analysis) that is congruent with
our MRP supertree for these species. They state that K. lactis and A. gossypii are evolving faster than S. kluyveri and K.
waltii and are therefore likely to be "attracted" to long
branches. The AV method makes use of branch length
information from individual gene trees, and we suspect
the inferred AV supertree phylogeny amongst the {K. lactis, A. gossypii} and {S. kluyveri, K. waltii} clades may be
suffering from long-branch attraction artifacts. As additional taxa can help break long branches, it is likely that
stochastic errors will be eradicated with the addition of
extra genome data when it becomes available, thus eliminating erroneous inferences.
The sister group relationships amongst the Saccharomyces
sensu stricto species also differs between our supertree phyPage 5 of 15

logenies (Figure 1A&B). For example, the MRP phylogeny
places S. bayanus at the base of the Saccharomyces sensu
stricto node and infers a ladderised topology amongst the
Saccharomyces sensu stricto species. The MRP inferences
(Figure 1A) match those proposed by our multigene phylogeny (Figure 2) and are identical to that proposed by Jeffroy et al. Alternatively, the AV supertree infers that S.
bayanus and S. kudriavzevii are sister taxa (Figure 1B).
There is also an interesting difference regarding the relative position of Candida glabrata and Saccharomyces castellii, the supertrees and the multigene phylogeny
constructed by Jeffroy et al [38] place C. glabrata at the
base of the clade containing the organisms that have
undergone a WGD (Figure 1A). Alternatively, our concatenated alignment infers a phylogeny with S. castellii at the
base of the WGD clade (Figure 2), in agreement with syntenic studies [39].
It is possible that the differences between the phylogenies
inferred by the MRP and AV supertrees for the Saccharomyces sensu stricto group are due the inclusion of paralagous
sequences from the WGD species. We therefore constructed a supertree based exclusively on the species that
have undergone the WGD, using 1,368 putative orthologous gene families (see methods). ML phylogenies were
reconstructed for all gene families. The WGD-specific
supertree (Figure 3) concurs with the MRP fungal supertree (Figure 1A) and the phylogeny of Jeffroy et al, suggesting this topology is correct.
The placement of C. glabrata as the most basal WGD
genome is in disagreement with the tree inferred from the
concatenated alignment (Figure 2). We therefore investigated the influence of fast evolving sites. Using a gamma
distribution, we placed fast-evolving sites for each gene
family into one of 8 categories, where site class 8 was the
most heterogeneous, and class 1 were stationary. We systematically removed the fastest evolving sites one at a
time, and rebuilt ML phylogenies based on these reduced
alignments. Supertrees were once again reconstructed for
these new phylogeny sets. When the two fastest classes of
sites were removed, (reducing the combined length of all
1,368 genes by ~18% and ~30%), the resultant supertrees
group S. castelli and C. glabrata as a monophyletic group
and fail to differentiate which is closer to the outgroup
[see additional file 3]. When we additionally remove the
third fastest evolving site class (reducing the combined
length by ~38%), the final supertree [see additional file 3]
again infers C. glabrata at the base of the WGD clade (Figure 3). In an effort to account for compositional biases we
also recoded the underlying amino acid alignments into
the six Dayhoff groups and inferred individual gene phylogenies using the Bayesian criterion [see additional file 4].
The resultant supertree is identical to that shown in Figure

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/99

3, and again places C. glabrata at the base of the WGD
clade.
To analyse the degree of conflicting phylogenetic signal
within the concatenated alignment, a phylogenetic network was constructed (Figure 4). Numerous alternative
splits are present (491 in total). A bootstrap analysis was
preformed on the phylogenetic network [see additional
file 5]. It is interesting to note that we never observe a split
that excludes either C. glabrata or S. castellii from the
remaining WGD organisms. This conflicts with the concatenated phylogeny (Figure 2), which strongly infers that
C. glabrata sits beside the remaining WGD organisms to
the exclusion of S. castellii. It is possible that a systematic
bias [40] may be influencing our supertrees, as synteny
information clearly shows that S. castellii diverges from
the Saccharomyces sensu stricto lineage before S. castellii,
[39]. Therefore topologies that place C. glabrata as an outgroup to the Saccharomyces sensu stricto lineage and S. castellii are unreliable [39] and need closer scrutiny. These
incongruences suggest that genome data for additional
basal WGD species is required to confidently resolve inferences at the base of the WGD clade.
Phylogenetic relationships amongst Candida species
Both super tree (Figure 1) and superalignment (Figure 2)
topologies inferred a robust monophyletic clade containing organisms which translate CTG as serine instead of
leucine [41-44]. This codon reassignment has been proposed to have occurred ~170 million years ago [45]. Further inspection showed that there are two distinct CTG
sub-clades, the first contains {Candida lusitaniae, Candida
guilliermondii, Debaromyces hansenii} and the second containing {Candida tropicalis, Candida albicans, Candida dubliniensis, Candida parapsilosis} (Figure 1). C. lusitaniae and
C. guilliermondii are haploid yeasts, and are apparently
fully sexual [46-48]. D. hansenii is homothallic, with a
fused mating locus [49,50]. In contrast, members of the
second clade have at best a cryptic sexual cycle and have
never been observed to undergo meiosis [51-55]. We
decided to investigate this clade in further detail, and performed specific supertree, spectral and network analyses.
Trace sequence data for Lodderomyces elongisporus, once
proposed as the sexual form (teleomorph) of C. parapsilosis were also included [56,57].

We located 2,146 putative orthologous gene families from
our CTG database (see methods). ML phylogenies were
reconstructed for all gene families, and a supertree based
on these trees was reconstructed. The resultant CTG specific supertree placed L. elongisporus within the asexual
clade (Figure 5A) with high BP support (100%), in agreement with other phylogenetic studies [58,59]. A CTG specific phylogenetic network was also constructed and infers
that L. elongisporus groups beside C. parapsilosis, although

there is a degree of conflict with this inference illustrated
by a number of alternative splits (Figure 5B). Interestingly
there is no conflict for the grouping of C. albicans and C.
dubliniensis illustrating their high genotypic similarity
[60]. These results raise interesting questions regarding
the sexual status of the Candida species. It is possible that
the "asexual" species are in fact fully sexual. C. albicans
and C. dubliniensis have been observed to mate [53], and
in addition the C. albicans genome contains most of the
requirements for meiosis [61]. In contrast the evidence
that L. elongisporus reproduces sexually is sketchy, and is
based on the appearance of asci, with one (or sometimes
two) spores [62]. It is clear that further analysis is
required, which will be greatly aided when the fully annotated genome sequences of L. elongisporus and C. parapsilosis become available.
Our CTG specific supertree also suggests that D. hansenii
and C. guilliermondii are sister taxa, as they are grouped
together with high support (100% BP) to the exclusion of
C. lusitaniae. Other studies [58,63] have placed C. lusita-

niae in a clade beside C. guilliermondii, and inferred a
closer relationship between the two compared with Debaryomyces species. We found 1,208 gene families present in
all CTG taxa; these were concatenated together to give a
nucleotide alignment of 1,291,068 sites or 860,712 sites
when third codon positions are removed. A phylogenetic
network based on this nucleotide alignment (Figure 5B)
corroborated the CTG-specific supertree regarding the
grouping of C. guilliermondii and D. hansenii as sister taxa
to the exclusion of C. lusitianiae. Subsequent spectral analyses (Figure 5C) reinforce our CTG specific supertree and
network inferences. For example, split A (Figure 5C)
shows the relatively high degree of support for the grouping of three sexual species {C. lusitianiae, C. guilliermondii
and D. hansenii} as sister taxa. Split C groups C. guilliermondii and D. hansenii together, in agreement with our
CTG supertree and network. However, there is nearly
equal character support for the grouping of C. lusitaniae
and D. hansenii (0.00609 vs. 0.00501) illustrated by split
E (Figure 5C). Therefore, based on whole genome comparisons there is only marginal evidence for the grouping

Conclusion
In this study we set out to reconstruct a fungal phylogeny
from whole genome sequences. Two alternative strategies
were chosen (supertrees and concatenated methods), and
overall we observed a high degree of congruence between
both approaches. We recovered robust fungal, phyla, subphyla and class clades. Overall our inferences agreed with
previous phylogenetic studies based on single genes and
morphological characteristics.
The phylogenomic approach undertaken in this study is
novel in fungal phylogenetics as it circumvents problems
associated with single gene phylogenies and selection of

robust phylogenetic markers. Our results suggest that it
may be possible to piece together the tree of life using
whole genomes. This is of interest as we expect the
number of available genomes to increase substantially in
tandem with new sequencing strategies [64], which continue to decrease the costs associated with sequencing.
However, our study also shows that certain nodes of the
tree (such as the WGD clade) are difficult to resolve even
with genome scale data.

Methods

The fungal database used in this analysis consisted of 42

approaches. The first involved a reciprocal best BLAST
[65] search with a cutoff E-value of 10-7 of Candida albicans
protein coding genes against unannotated Candida
genomes (Table 1). Top BLAST hits longer than 300 nucleotides were retained as putative open reading frames. The
second approach involved a pipeline of analysis that combined several different gene prediction programs including ab initio programs SNAP [66], Genezilla [67], and
AUGUSTUS [67] with gene models from Exonerate [68]
and Genewise [69] based on alignments of proteins and
Expressed sequence tags. The lines of evidence were
merged into a single gene prediction using a combiner
GLEAN (AJ Mackey, Q Liu, FCN Pereira, DS Roos, unpublished data). These annotations are freely available for
download [70].
Reconstruction of individual gene trees
Fungal homologous sequences were identified using the
BLASTP algorithm [65] with a cutoff E-value of 10-7 by
randomly selecting a sequence from the database, finding
its homologs, and removing the entire family from the
database. Another randomly selected sequence from
within the reduced database was then used as the new
starting point for the next search. This procedure was
repeated until all sequences had been removed from the
database. Gene families with more than one representative from any species were not considered for further analysis. Those remaining families with a minimum of four
sequences, and longer than 100 amino acids in length
were selected for phylogenetic analysis. In total 5,316 protein families met these criteria. Individual protein families
were aligned using ClustalW 1.81 [71] with the default
settings. The average length of each protein alignment was
697 sites. Due to the large number of protein families it
was not possible to manually curate all alignments. We
therefore used only conserved alignment blocks, located
using Gblocks version 0.91 b [72]. This filtering stage
reduced the average length of our alignments to 214 sites.
Permutation tail probability tests (PTP) [73,74] were performed on each alignment to test for the presence of evolutionary signal better than random (P < 0.01). We found
that 511 alignments failed the PTP test; therefore 4,805
were used for phylogenetic reconstruction analysis. Using
MultiPhyl [75] appropriate protein substitution models
were selected and used to reconstruct ML phylogenies for
each individual gene family. Bootstrap resampling was
carried out 100 times on each alignment and the results
were summarised with the majority-rule consensus
method with a threshold of 70%. These phylogenies were
used as input data in our supertree analysis. To account
for possible compositional biases within our data, neighbor joining [76] phylogenies were also reconstructed
based on distances derived from the LogDet transformation [77].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/99

We were concerned that our strategy for locating orthologous gene families was too liberal. Therefore, we also utilised a second stricter database search strategy that located
809 gene families [see additional file 1 &additional file 6].
Supertree reconstruction
In total 4,805 input trees were used as source data for this
supertree analysis. Using the supertree software package
CLANN 3.0.3b1 [78] three supertree methods were used
to reconstruct fungal phylogenies, the average consensus
method (AV) [27], the most similar supertree analysis
(MSSA) method [21], and matrix representation with parsimony (MRP) [25,26]. Using CLANN 3.0.3b1, 100 bootstrap resamplings were also carried out on the input data.
We tested for the presence of signal within our data using
the YAPTP test.
Multigene analysis
All proteins from the genome sequences were compared
with FASTP [79] to find orthologous genes via a best bidirectional strategy. The ortholog sets for each pair of species were combined with single-linkage clustering to form
multi-gene clusters of orthologs. In order to identify a set
of single-copy genes across all organisms, only those clusters with exactly one member per species were considered
for further analysis, we located 227 protein families that
contain all fungal taxa. To help identify ohnologs and
possible paralogs (with reference to the genomes that
have undergone a genome duplication) we used the yeast
genome browser [80,81] to filter out genes that have no
syntenic evidence. Overall 153 gene families were used for
further analysis [see additional file 2]. Individual gene
families were aligned, manually edited and concatenated
together to yield an alignment with 38,000 amino acid
sites. A ML phylogeny was reconstructed for this alignment using the MultiPhyml software. Branch supports
were determined via bootstrapping. In an attempt to visualise the degree of phylogenetic conflict within this concatenated alignment a phylogenetic network was
generated using the NeighborNet method [82].
Investigation of specific clades
CTG clade
The genomes of C. albicans, C. dubliniensis, C. tropicalis, C.
parapsilosis, D. hansenii, C. guilliermondii, C. lusitaniae and
the outgroup Y. lipolytica were combined to give a CTG
specific database. Data for L. elongisporus was retrieved
from the NCBI trace database and coding genes were predicted using a reciprocal best BLASTP search against C.
albicans. In total 2,146 gene families were longer than 100
amino acids in length, with evolutionary signal, were
retained for supertree analysis. ML phylogenies were
reconstructed for all gene families as described above, and
representative supertrees were reconstructed. A concatenated alignment based on 1,208 genes containing all CTG

taxa was created. Alternative splits in the concatenated
alignment were found using the NeighborNet method
[82], and represented as a phylogenetic network with the
SplitsTree software [83]. Using the software package Spectrum [84] we also performed a spectral analysis on this
nucleotide alignment.

WGD clade
The WGD clade includes the genomes of S. cerevisiae, S.
paradoxus, S. mikatae, S. kudriavzevii, S. bayanus, S. castellii
and C. glabrata. K. waltii was selected as an outgroup. For
a gene family to be retained, every gene within that family
must locate every other family member (and nothing else)
in a reciprocal BLASTP search (cutoff E-value of 10-7), be
in single copy and contain a minimum of 4 taxa. We
found 1,368 single gene families that met our criteria for
supertree analysis. ML phylogenies were reconstructed for
individual gene families as explained earlier. Phylogeny
sets were also generated using Bayesian and distance
based methods; [see additional file 4].
