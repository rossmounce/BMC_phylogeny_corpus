Abstract
Background: The rational design of peptide-based specific inhibitors of the caspase family members using their
X-ray crystallographies is an important strategy for chemical knockdown to define the critical role of each enzyme
in apoptosis and inflammation. Recently, we designed a novel potent peptide inhibitor, Ac-DNLD-CHO, for
caspase-3 using a new computational screening system named the Amino acid Positional Fitness (APF) method
(BMC Pharmacol. 2004, 4:7). Here, we report the specificity of the DNLD sequence against caspase-3 over other
major caspase family members that participate in apoptosis by computational docking and site-directed
mutagenesis studies.
Results: Ac-DNLD-CHO inhibits caspases-3, -7, -8, and -9 activities with Kiapp values of 0.68, 55.7, >200, and
>200 nM, respectively. In contrast, a well-known caspase-3 inhibitor, Ac-DEVD-CHO, inhibits all these caspases
with similar Kiapp values. The selective recognition of a DNLD sequence by caspase-3 was confirmed by substrate
preference studies using fluorometric methylcoumarin-amide (MCA)-fused peptide substrates. The bases for its
selectivity and potency were assessed on a notable interaction between the substrate Asn (N) and the caspase-3
residue Ser209 in the S3 subsite and the tight interaction between the substrate Leu (L) and the caspase-3
hydrophobic S2 subsite, respectively, in computational docking studies. Expectedly, the substitution of Ser209 with
alanine resulted in loss of the cleavage activity on Ac-DNLD-MCA and had virtually no effect on cleaving AcDEVD-MCA. These findings suggest that N and L residues in Ac-DNLD-CHO are the determinants for the
selective and potent inhibitory activity against caspase-3.
Conclusion: On the basis of our results, we conclude that Ac-DNLD-CHO is a reliable, potent and selective
inhibitor of caspase-3. The specific inhibitory effect on caspase-3 suggests that this inhibitor could become an
important tool for investigations of the biological function of caspase-3. Furthermore, Ac-DNLD-CHO may be
an attractive lead compound to generate novel effective non-peptidic pharmaceuticals for caspase-mediated
apoptosis diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorders and viral infection diseases.

Background
Apoptosis is a major form of cell death, characterized by a
series of apoptosis-specific morphological alterations and
nucleosomal DNA fragmentation of genomic DNA [1-3].
Recent studies toward understanding of the apoptosis
machinery have revealed the essential roles of a family of
cysteine aspartyl proteases named caspases (for reviews,
refs 4 and 5). To date, 14 caspases have been implicated in
the apoptotic and inflammatic pathway cascades: Caspases-2, -3, -6, -7, -8, -9, and -10 are involved in the initiation and execution of apoptosis, whereas caspases-1, -4,
and -5 participate in the activation of pro-inflammatory
cytokines during inflammation [4-9]. Apoptotic caspases
can be subdivided into initiator and executioner caspases.
They are normally expressed as proenzymes that mature
to their fully functional form through proteolytic cleavage
[4-9]. Autoprocessing of initiator caspases (e.g. caspases2, -8, -9, and -10) is facilitated by adaptor proteins, such
as the Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) and
apoptosis protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1). Executioner caspases (e.g. caspases-3, -6, and -7) can be activated following proteolytic processing by initiator
caspases [10,11]. Activated executioner caspases cleave a
critical set of cellular proteins selectively and in a coordinated manner leading to cell death. More than 60 caspase
substrates have been identified to date [12].
The caspase cascades in apoptosis maintain and amplify
the original apoptotic stimuli, and their disregulations are
involved as key factors in the development of a variety of
diseases, including Alzheimers's disease [13], Parkinson's
disease [14] and cancer [15]. In particular, caspase-3 has
been characterized as the major contributor to the process
of apoptosis, and the phenotype of caspase-3 knockout
mice suggests the necessity of the enzyme during brain
development [16]. Therefore, studies with peptide inhibitors of caspase-3 have helped to define a central role for
the enzyme in apoptosis. So far, several peptide inhibitors
of caspase-3 have been reported [17-20], some of which
were effective in animal models of amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS) [21], sepsis [22], and hypoxic-ischemic
brain injury [23].
Among caspases, the structures of caspases-1, -2, -3, -7, -8,
and -9 have been determined by X-ray crystallography
[24-29]. The three-dimensional structures reveal that the
active sites of all caspases contain positively charged S1
subsites that bind the negatively charged Asp in the P1
position on the substrates. Since the S1 subsites are highly
conserved, all caspases cleave solely after aspartate residues [7,24-29]. Recognition of at least four amino acids
(P1–P4) in the cleavage sites is also a necessary requirement for efficient catalysis. The S2–S4 subsites on caspases
vary significantly, resulting in varied substrate specificities
for the P2–P4 positions, despite an absolute requirement

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2210/7/8

for Asp in the P1 position [7,24-29]. To define the peptide
substrate specificities at the P2–P4 positions of caspases, a
combinatorial approach using a positional scanning synthetic combinatorial library (PS-SCL) was taken. As a
result, the optimal recognition sequence of peptide substrate for caspase-3 was shown to be DEVD [30]. The
sequence DEVD within poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
(PARP) is known to be recognized and cleaved by caspase3 [9]. This sequence has been applied to creating the peptide aldehyde inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO. However, AcDEVD-CHO inhibits not only caspase-3 activity, but also
the activities of caspases-1, -6, -7, -8, -9, and -10 [31]. To
date, therefore, no tetrapeptide inhibitor selective for caspase-3 has yet to be identified.
It should be possible to derive the most selective and
potent peptide inhibitor for each caspase from its comprehensive tetrapeptide library. In this regard, we recently
developed a new strategy named the APF method for the
computational design of peptides with high affinities for
target proteins [32]. This computational virtual screening
method allows the rapid prediction of binding free energies between all peptides being tested and a target protein.
Recently, we used this method to identify potent peptide
inhibitors of caspase-3. Importantly, a novel specific peptide inhibitor, Ac-DNLD-CHO, was shown to have almost
the same potent inhibitory activity against caspase-3 as
the well-known Ac-DEVD-CHO. In this study, we investigated the structural and functional relevance to potency
and selectivity of this rationally designed peptide by
enzyme kinetic analyses, computational docking studies
and site-directed mutagenesis analysis. The results identify the specific interaction of the P3 position (Asn) in
DNLD with the S3 (Ser209) subsite on caspase-3 as the
most important determinant of the selectivity of AcDNLD-CHO.

Results
Potency and selectivity of Ac-DNLD-CHO against
caspase-3
At present, three peptide inhibitors (aldehyde form) of
caspase-3, Ac-DEVD-CHO, Ac-DQTD-CHO, and AcDMQD-CHO, are commercially available. Therefore, we
compared the potency and selectivity of these peptide
inhibitors with Ac-DNLD-CHO using human recombinant caspases-3, -7, -8, and -9. As shown Fig. 1A, AcDNLD-CHO inhibits caspase-3 (IC50 = 9.89 nM) with
almost the same potency as Ac-DEVD-CHO (IC50 = 4.19
nM). The apparent Kiapp values for Ac-DNLD-CHO and
Ac-DEVD-CHO are calculated to be 0.680 and 0.288 nM,
respectively (Table 1). Ac-DEVD-CHO inhibits caspase-7
(Kiapp = 4.48 nM), -8 (Kiapp = 0.597 nM), and -9 (Kiapp =
1.35 nM) to similar extents. This observation is consistent
with the previous report that Ac-DEVD-CHO inhibits caspases-3, -7, and -8 [31]. In contrast, Ac-DNLD-CHO has

very low inhibitory activity against caspases-8 and -9.
Although Ac-DNLD-CHO inhibits caspase-7, the IC50
(245 nM) is one-order of magnitude higher than that of
Ac-DEVD-CHO (IC50 = 19.7 nM). It is noteworthy that AcDNLD-CHO exhibits an approximate by 80-fold selectivity for caspase-3 over caspase-7 (Kiapp = 55.7 nM) (Table
1), although these caspases have very similar protein
structures and substrate preferences [30].
Ac-DQTD-CHO inhibits caspases-3 (Kiapp = 1.27 nM) and
-8 (Kiapp = 9.75 nM) weakly as compared to Ac-DEVDCHO, and inhibits caspase-9 (Kiapp = 14.5 nM) and -7
(Kiapp = 21.8 nM) even more weakly (Fig. 1 and Table 1).
These inhibition curves for Ac-DQTD-CHO are shifted
about one order of magnitude lower than those of AcDEVD-CHO. On the other hand, Ac-DMQD-CHO inhibits caspase-3 weakly (IC50 = 193 nM), whereas it has little
inhibitory effect on caspases-7, -8, and -9 even at concentrations up to about 200 nM (Fig. 1 and Table 1). The
kinetic analyses show Ac-DNLD-CHO to have a potent
and selective inhibitory activity against caspase-3, whereas
Ac-DEVD-CHO potently inhibits all four caspases tested.
Abilities of caspases to cleave the fluorometric substrate of
DNLD
To determine the potency and selectivity of the DNLD
sequence against caspase-3, we compared substrate preferences between DNLD and DEVD among caspases. Currently, Ac-DEVD-MCA is used as the substrate for caspase3 (DEVDase). Unfortunately, caspases-7, -8, and -9 are
also able to cleave this substrate (Fig. 2), consistent with
the previous observation [33] that although caspase-3 is
the major source of cellular DEVDase activity in apoptotic
cell extracts, other caspases are considered to contribute to
the DEVDase activity. That is, DEVDase is not necessarily
equivalent to the true activity of caspase-3. From these
data, it is clear that using Ac-DEVD-MCA as a substrate
makes it hard to measure precisely the activity of caspase3 alone in crude cell extracts.

To probe the functional difference between DNLD and
DEVD sequences, we synthesized Ac-DNLD-MCA and
examined its preference as a substrate. As shown in Fig.
2A, Ac-DNLD-MCA is cleaved as efficiently by caspase-3 as
Ac-DEVD-MCA. Importantly, Ac-DNLD-MCA is hardly
cleaved by caspase-7 (Fig. 2B). Additionally, caspases-8
and -9 have no ability to cleave Ac-DNLD-MCA (Fig. 2C
and 2D). This implies that using Ac-DNLD-MCA makes it
possible to measure the sole activity of caspase-3 in cell
extracts. Taken together, these data suggest that the recognition of the DNLD sequence among the caspases is selective to caspase-3.

Definition of active site residues of caspases
In order to understand the specificity of the sequence
DNLD for caspase-3 in the structural aspects, we next
sought to determine the amino acid residues composing
the active sites of caspases. By inspecting the interactions
of peptide/caspase complexes in their X-ray structures [2429], we identified fifteen and fourteen residues in the
active sites of caspases-2, -3, -6, -7 and -10, and caspases8 and -9, respectively (Fig. 3A). The active site residues are
located in segments on the linear sequences of caspases
(Fig. 3A), and construct similar 3 dimensional pockets of
the active sites (Fig. 3B). From these data, 4 subsites (S1,
S2, S3, and S4) (Fig. 4A) can be assigned that indicate common structural positions in the active sites of all caspases
(Fig. 4B).

The aligned active site residues in each caspase construct
almost the same subsites. The difference is that the active
site residues (ϒ in Fig. 3A) of caspases-3 (F256), -7 (F282),
-6 (A269), -10 (S500) and -2 (F409) belonging to the S2–
3 subsites are aligned at the same position in the
sequences, while those of caspases-8 (Y365) and -9
(K292) are aligned at different positions (compare Fig. 3A
and Fig. 4). However, the structural superposition of these
caspases (Fig. 3B) reveals that these amino acids are
located at the same position (S2–3) in the S2 subsites (Fig.
4). Previous work has also shown that caspase-8 has Y365
situated in roughly the same spatial position as F256 of
caspase-3 [27]. Thus, using the primary and tertiary structural information about caspases, we identified the amino
acid residues important for substrate binding in the active
sites of caspases as illustrated in Fig. 4 in a model of DEVD
binding.
Evaluation of active site definition
Fig. 5 shows the plots of the free energies of binding calculated by AutoDock [34] and the experimentally
observed Kiapp values summarized in Table 2. The best
value obtained for Ac-DNLD-CHO is -12.99 kcal/mol
(complex with caspase-3). Importantly, there are good
correlations between all the calculated free energies of
binding of Ac-DNLD-CHO to caspases-3, -7, -8 and -9,
and their observed Kiapp values. The correlation coefficient
of R = 0.75 obtained from the plots is an appropriate
value, suggesting that the AutoDock program used here
produces reliable binding modes, and that the definition
of amino acid residues composing the active sites of caspases is adequate.

Phylogenetic analysis of the apoptotic caspases-2, -3, -6, 7, -8, -9, and -10 shows that executioner caspases (-3, -7,
and -6) belong to the same subfamily and initiator caspases (-2, -8, -9, and -10) belong to other subfamilies,
thus reflecting their functional roles (Fig. 6A). If our active
site definition is adequate, a similar phylogenetic analysis

would reflect their substrate specificities. The phylogenetic analysis of the active site residues was conducted by
the NJ algorithm [35]. Interestingly, the active site phylogeny is consistent with the substrate specificities of caspases
(Fig. 6B). Nicholson and co-workers have clearly demonstrated that caspases are divided into three groups on the
basis of substrate specificity analysis using a combinatorial approach: Group I enzymes (caspases-1, -4, and -5)
prefer (W/Y)EHD↓ peptides; Group II enzymes (caspases2, -3, and -7) prefer DEXD↓ peptides; Group III enzymes
(caspases-6, -8, -9, and -10) prefer (I/L/V)EXD↓ peptides
[30,31]. As shown in Fig. 6B, caspases-3, -7, and -2 (Group
II) are classified into together, and other caspases-6, -8, -9,

and -10 (Group III) fall into other classes. It should be
noted that caspase-2 belongs to the same class as caspases3 and -7 in our active site phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 6B),
although caspase-2 is suggested to be an initiator caspase
(Fig. 6A). The results strongly support the validity of our
active site definition as illustrated in Fig. 4B.
Evaluation of docking program for binding mode analysis
To elucidate the reason that Ac-DNLD-CHO is a potent
and selective inhibitor for caspase-3 even though it has
the same DXXD motif as Ac-DEVD-CHO, Ac-DQTDCHO, and Ac-DMQD-CHO, computational docking studies were employed. We performed docking analysis using
the AutoDock algorithm [34] to examine the binding

modes of the peptide inhibitors at the active sites of caspases-3, -7, -8, and -9.
Among the above caspase inhibitors, a well-known AcDEVD-CHO was docked into the active sites of caspases,
and then we measured how close the AutoDock can reproduce their complex structures of Ac-DEVD-CHO/caspase.
Superpositions with the most minimized energies of
docked Ac-DEVD-CHO in complexes of Ac-DEVD-CHO/
caspases-3, -7, -8, and -9 yield root mean square distances
(RMSDs) of 1.28 Å, 1.41 Å, 1.85 Å, and 1.46 Å, respectively (Table 2). Hence, AutoDock analysis is successful in
reproducing the binding conformation of tetrapeptide
inhibitors (aldehyde form). Furthermore, the results indicate that our docking procedures (energy minimization
protocol and docking parameters) are reliable.

Selective binding mode of Ac-DNLD-CHO with caspase-3
To understand the binding mode of Ac-DNLD-CHO with
caspase-3, Ac-DNLD-CHO was docked onto the active site
of caspase-3 by the AutoDock program (Fig. 7A). The
main-chain of Ac-DNLD-CHO forms hydrogen bonds at
NH (Asn3) – O (Arg207), O (Asn3) – NH (Arg207), O
(Leu2) – HH1 (Arg207), and NH (Asp1) – O (Ser205) in
the S1 and S3 subsites, respectively (Table 3). Asp in the P4
position of Ac-DNLD-CHO donates hydrogen bonds to
the Asp208, Trp214, and Phe250, and Asp in the P1 position interacts with Arg64. All of these interactions are
observed in the complex of Ac-DEVD-CHO/caspase-3
although the hydrogen bonding distances and angles are
slightly different (Table 3, Fig. 7B). It should be noted that
Asn (P3) and Leu (P2) in Ac-DNLD-CHO have characteristic interaction patterns with caspase-3; the HD of Asn (P3)

forms a direct hydrogen bond with OG of Ser209 (S3–4
subsite) and does not interact with Arg207 (S3-3 subsite),
while Leu in the P2 position forms tight hydrophobic contacts with Trp206, Tyr204, and Phe256 in the S2 subsite of
caspase-3. Meanwhile, the Glu in the P3 position of AcDEVD-CHO forms a direct interaction with Arg207 but
not Ser209, although water-mediated interactions with
Ser209 and/or Ser65 may exist (compare 7A and 7B, see
Additional file 1)
Importantly, the S3–4 subsites of caspases-7, -8, and -9
have a conserved Pro residue (Fig. 4A). Consequently, a
hydrogen bond between Asn (P3) in Ac-DNLD-CHO and
the S3–4 subsite (Pro) of caspases-7, -8, and -9 can not be
formed (Fig. 8, 1st. column). Furthermore, in the hydrophobic S2 subsites of caspases-8 (Val410, Tyr412, and
Tyr365) and -9 (Val352, Trp354, Lys292), Leu (P2) of Ac-

DNLD-CHO is difficult to be accepted (Fig. 8). In contrast,
since the Arg at the S3-3 subsites is conserved in all caspase family proteins (Fig. 4A), the interactions of Glu (P3)
of Ac-DEVD-CHO with the S3-3 subsites are considered to
decrease the selectivity while they increase the binding
affinities of Ac-DEVD-CHO (Fig. 8, 2nd. column). The
hydrophobic contacts between Val (P2) of Ac-DEVDCHO and the S2 subsites are probably weaker than those
between Leu (P2) of Ac-DNLD-CHO and the S2 subsites
(Fig. 8). This prediction is supported by comparisons of
the changes in Accessible Surface Area (ΔASA) between
Leu (P2) and Val (P2), which are calculated to be 145 and
113 Å 2, respectively (Table 3). Because it is known that
there is good correlation between the amount of nonpolar
surface of higher ΔASA and hydrophobic interactions
[36], the ΔASA of Leu (P2) of Ac-DNLD-CHO may bear to

pase-3 is attributable to the notable hydrogen bond
between Asn (P3) and Ser209 (S3–4 subsite).
To prove the significance of Ser209 in the interaction of
the substrate Asn, the caspase-3 residue Ser209 was
replaced with alanine by site-directed mutagenesis and
the effect on recognition of DNLD was determined using
MCA-fused peptide substrates. The substituted (S209A)
and wild-type caspase-3 (active forms) were generated by
coexpression of HA-p17 and HA-p12 subunits in in vitro
translation system (Fig. 7E). The mutant caspase-3 cleaved
Ac-DEVD-MCA as efficient as the wild-type. In contrast,
the substitution (S209A) resulted in greater than 60% loss
of cleavage activity on Ac-DNLD-MCA (compare Fig. 7C
and 7D). These results strongly support the computational prediction that the specific interaction of DNLD
with caspase-3 is attributable to the hydrogen bond
between Asn (P3) and Ser209 in the S3–4 subsite.

Specific interaction of Ac-DNLD-CHO with caspase-3
To examine the specificity of Ac-DNLD-CHO for caspase3, the binding mode was further compared with AcDQTD-CHO and Ac-DMQD-CHO. Ac-DQTD-CHO,
which inhibits caspases-3, -7, -8, and -9 activities with
Kiapp values of 1.27 nM, 21.8 nM, 9.75 nM, and 14.5 nM,
respectively (Table 1), has a similar selectivity for these
caspases as Ac-DEVD-CHO, and its potency is one-order
of magnitude lower than that of Ac-DEVD-CHO (Fig. 1).
The reasons for the poor selectivity of Ac-DQTD-CHO as
compared with Ac-DNLD-CHO may be due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between Gln (P3) with the Arg207
(caspase-3), Asn88 (caspase-7), Arg258 (caspase-8), or
Arg355 (caspase-9) as in the case of Ac-DEVD-CHO, and
weak hydrophobic contacts with the S2 subsites of all caspases (Fig. 8, 3rd. column).

On the other hand, Ac-DMQD-CHO, which inhibits the
activities of caspases-3, -7, -8, and -9 with Kiapp values of
13.3 nM, >200 nM, >200 nM, and >200 nM, respectively
(Table 1), has unique selectivity for caspase-3, but with
low potency for all. This may be attributed to a lack of
interaction between Gln (P2) and the S2 subsite (Fig. 8,
4th. column). Meanwhile, no side-chain hydrogen bonds
between Met (P3) of Ac-DMQD-CHO and the S3-3 subsites
of caspases-8, and -9 are formed. In the cases of caspases3 and -7, the formation of hydrogen bonds between Met
(P3) and the Arg (Arg207 for caspase-3 and Arg233 for caspase-7) in the S3-3 subsites is possible (Fig. 8, 4th. column). These results strongly support the specificity of AcDNLD-CHO for caspase-3. The biding modes used in this
analysis are available in additional data file [see Additional file 1].

Discussion
Ac-DNLD-CHO is the first reported example of a novel
potent peptide inhibitor of caspase-3 [32]. The sequence
was rationally designed by the structure-based computational APF method, and is so far not known in any natural
caspase substrate. Furthermore, Ac-DNLD-CHO has been
shown to inhibit caspase-3 as potently as Ac-DEVD-CHO,
a well-known caspase-3 inhibitor. These observations suggest that the APF method is useful to design effective peptides with high binding affinities for target proteins. In the
present study, we examined the specificity of Ac-DNLDCHO for caspase-3 by inhibition kinetics analysis, computational docking studies and site-directed mutagenesis.
In our in vitro assay system, Ac-DNLD-CHO inhibits caspase-3 (Kiapp = 0.68 nM) more selectively than caspases-7,
-8, and -9 (Kiapp = 55.7, >200, and >200 nM, respectively).
These observed Kiapp values correlate well with the calculated free energies of binding (ΔGcalc) by AutoDock
between Ac-DNLD-CHO and caspases-3, -7, -8, and -9
(ΔGcalc = -12.99, -11.99, -10.78, and -9.98 kcal/mol,
respectively). In plots of the calculated ΔGcalc values and
experimentally observed Kiapp values, a correlation coefficient of R = 0.75 was obtained. This implies that the AutoDock produces reliable binding conformations of
tetrapeptides on caspase molecules and that it is suitable
for the analysis of the binding modes of tetrapeptide/caspase complexes.

The docking studies data reveal the notable characteristics
of Ac-DNLD-CHO binding to caspase-3 to be the hydrogen bonds between Asn (P3 position) and Ser209 in the
S3–4 subsite of caspase-3, and the tightly hydrophobic contacts between Leu in the P2 position and the S2 subsite
composed of three aromatic amino acids, Tyr204, Trp206,
and Phe256. In the S3 subsite of caspase-3, Ser209 (S3–4)
is highly preferred for the interaction with Asn (P3),
although other residues such as Arg can be accommodated, as observed in the case of caspase-8 (Fig. 8, 1st. column). A weak side chain-side chain hydrogen bond is
formed between Arg258 (S3-1) of caspase-8 and Asn (P3)
rather than that formed between Ser209 (S3–4) of caspase3 and Asn (P3). Hence, Asn in Ac-DNLD-CHO is the only
peptide residue involved in a side-chain-specific hydrogen
bond with Ser209 (S3–4) in the caspase-3 molecule.
The alignment of active site residues also supports these
characteristic, and provides the information for speculating the binding ability of Ac-DNLD-CHO to other apoptotic caspases. The S3–4 subsites of caspases show
considerable diversity in their amino acids and in their
interaction with Asn (P3) of Ac-DNLD-CHO, which is
only possible for caspase-3. In caspase-8, Asn (P3) is able
to interact with Arg258 (S3-1) only when the conformation of the main-chain backborn is considerably changed
(Fig. 8, 1st. column). Arg207, Arg233, Arg 413, and

Arg355 (S3-3 subsites) in caspases-3, -7, -8, and -9, respectively, do not interact with Asn (P3). Meanwhile, the Glu
in the P3 position of Ac-DEVD-CHO binds to Arg207 (S33 subsite) in caspase-3. The S3-3 subsites of caspases-3, -7, 8, and -9, however, are also conserved as Arg residues.
Therefore, Glu (P3) probably interacts tightly with Arg (S33 subsites) in all of the caspases. Obviously, substitution
of Glu with Asn in the P3 position results in a substantial
increase in the selectivity of DNLD for caspase-3.
On the other hand, amino acid residues in the P2 positions of peptides such as Leu and Val are highly preferred
in the hydrophobic pockets in S2 subsites except for caspases-8 and -9, as illustrated in Fig. 8. Furthermore, the S2
subsites of caspases-3 and -7 have three hydrophobic aromatic residues. The structural analyse combined with the
inhibitory activities suggest a critical role for the hydrophobic interactions between Leu (P2) in Ac-DNLD-CHO
and the S2 subsite of caspase-3, since the ΔASA of Leu (P2)
is wider than Val (P2) of Ac-DEVD-CHO (Table 3). Furthermore, although the docking information obtained by
the comparison of DNLD with DEVD is somewhat difficult to understand completely, the stereochemical configuration of the peptide is important for both binding and
inhibitory activity, while the loss of hydrogen bonds and
hydrophobic interactions are critical.
The specific inhibitory activity of Ac-DNLD-CHO against
caspase-3 is also confirmed by the comparison of both
inhibitory activities and binding modes with commercially available caspase-3 peptide inhibitors, Ac-DQTD-

CHO and Ac-DMQD-CHO (Fig. 8). The Gln (P3 position)
side chain of Ac-DQTD-CHO can make contact with Args
in the S3-3 subsites of caspases-3, -7, -8, and -9. The Thr in
the P2 position interacts with hydrophobic pockets in the
S2 subsites in all caspases. Hence, Ac-DQTD-CHO shows
less selectivity and a lower inhibitory activity than AcDNLD-CHO. On the other hand, for Ac-DMQD-CHO,
the Met substitution in the P3 position, which might
reduce its ability to form hydrogen bonds with Arg in S3-3
subsites of caspases-3 and -7, resulting in a substantial
decrease in inhibitory activity (Table 1). The substitution
Leu or Val by Gln in the P2 position results in a complete
lack of interaction, thereby drastically decreasing the
inhibitory activity. On the basis of these docking studies,
the specific inhibitory activity of Ac-DNLD-CHO on caspase-3 is strongly suggested to be due to the selective
hydrogen bond between Asn (P3) and Ser209 in the S3–4
subsite, and the tightly hydrophobic contacts of Leu (P2)
with the aromatic amino acids Tyr204, Trp206, and
Phe256 in the S2 subsite.
Furthermore, we performed critical examinations of the
sequence specificity of DNLD using fluorogenic MCApeptide substrates, since in general, recognition of peptide
sequence is detected more stringently in substrates than
inhibitors. As expected, the fluorogenic substrate AcDNLD-MCA exhibited high selectivity for caspase-3 over
caspases-7, -8, and -9. This implies that Ac-DNLD-MCA is
useful for the precise measurement of the activity of caspase-3 in crude apoptotic cell extracts. In site-directed
mutagenesis studies, the substituted (S209A) caspase-3

cThe change in Accessible Surface Area (ASA) per Leu2 or Val2 residue upon dissociation of the complex structure was calculated by DSSP [54],

peptide inhibitors or caspase-3 occur upon dissociation.
bHydrogen

considerably decreased the ability to cleave Ac-DNLDMCA (Fig. 7C). This is consistent with the computationally predicted binding mode of Ac-DNLD-CHO on caspase-3 (Fig. 7A). Obviously, the hydrogen bond between
the caspase-3 residue Ser209 and the substrate Asn (N)
plays a critical role in the specificity of the peptide.
Recently, to monitor the time course of caspase-3 activation during apoptosis at the cellular level, an expressed
fusion protein containing cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)
linked by a short peptide possessing the caspase-3 cleavage sequence, DEVD, to yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)
(i.e. CFP-DEVD-YFP) has been utilized [37]. The protein
undergoes fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)
between CFP and YFP. When caspase-3 is activated, the
DEVD sequence is cleaved and FRET is reduced [37]. By
using the DNLD sequence, a more precise measurement is
possible.
Previous studies have indicated that peptide-based caspase inhibitors are effective in animal models of ALS [21],
sepsis [22], and hypoxic-ischemic brain injury [23]. Some
inhibitors, however, have poor whole cell activity due to
limited cell permeability [38]. In this study, although the

in vivo use of Ac-DNLD-CHO was not performed, the
activity would be enhanced by modifying the DNLD
sequence with benzylcarboxy, methyl ester, and fluoromethyl ketone (FMK) (i.e. Z-D(OMe)NLD(OMe)-FMK)
or protein transduction domains (PTDs), such as the TAT
protein [39], Antennapedia homeodomain [40], or
arginine-rich peptides [41] (i.e. PTD+Linker+DNLDCHO). Furthermore, many peptide-mimetic caspase-3
inhibitors have been prepared based on the DEVD
tetrapeptide. [38,42,43]. As has been suggested previously
[32], the optimization of a binding peptide sequence for
a target protein, such as DNLD, includes obtaining sufficient information about its subsequent conversion to
small molecular non-peptidic compounds. The DNLD
tetrapeptide characterized here, with a molecular mass of
about 500, is within reach of small molecule design and
can serve as a minimal model for a caspase specific inhibitor. Therefore, the optimized peptide-based design of
small molecule mimetics would be expected to be possible by using the configuration with the lowest ΔG. In
developing non-peptidic caspase-3-specific inhibitors, the
DNLD tetrapeptide provides a valuable starting point for
the design of specific peptide-mimetics and their optimization. For example, a unique side chain containing an

amide is present at the P3 position of DNLD, suggesting
that this is a critical target region in the design of caspase3-specific small molecules and potential therapeutic
agents.

Conclusion
On the basis of our results, we conclude that Ac-DNLDCHO is a reliable, potent and selective inhibitor of caspase-3. The binding site for DNLD comprises the same
active pockets of caspase-3 that are known to kind other
inhibitory peptides such as DEVD, DQTD, and DMQD.
The substituted residues Asn and Leu in the P3 and P2 posi-

tions, respectively, play important roles in both the selectivity and potency for caspase-3. The specific inhibitory
effect on caspase-3 suggests that this inhibitor could
become an important tool for investigations of the biological function of caspase-3. Ac-DNLD-MCA could also be
useful in determining whether caspase-3 acts in cells that
respond to various apoptotic stimuli such as drugs and
viruses. Furthermore, Ac-DNLD-CHO may be an attractive lead compound to generate novel effective non-peptidic pharmaceuticals for caspase-mediated apoptosis
diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorders and viral
infection diseases.

Methods
Materials
Ac-DNLD-CHO and Ac-DNLD-MCA were synthesized by
Peptide Institute, Inc (Osaka, Japan). Ac-DEVD-CHO, AcDQTD-CHO, Ac-DMQD-CHO, Ac-DEVD-MCA, Ac-IETDMCA, and Ac-LEHD-MCA were purchased from Peptide
Institute, Inc. Recombinant human caspases-3, -7, -8, and
-9 were from Calbiochem.
Caspase assay and inhibition
The activities of caspases-3 and -7 were measured using
Ac-DEVD-MCA as the substrate. The activities of caspases8 and -9 were measured using Ac-IETD-MCA and AcLEHD-MCA, respectively. To compare the inhibitory
potencies of Ac-DNLD-CHO, Ac-DEVD-CHO, Ac-DQTDCHO, and Ac-DMQD-CHO against caspases-3, -7, -8, and
-9, one unit (the amount of enzyme that cleaves 1 nmol
of the substrate sequence per hr) of each active recombinant human caspase was incubated with various concentrations of a peptide inhibitor in assay buffer (100 mM
NaCl, 50 mM HEPES, 10 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 10%
glycerol, and 0.1% CHAPS, pH 7.4) at 37°C for 30 min
with shaking in a 96-well assay plate (CORNING). Then,
caspase substrate was added to each well to a final concentration of 200 μM and the liberation of MCA was monitored continuously at 37°C using a 96-well plate reader
Wallace 1420 ARVOsx (PerkinElmer) with an excitation
wavelength of 390 nm and an emission wavelength of
460 nm.
Ac-DNLD-MCA and Ac-DEVD-MCA cleavage assay
To characterize the potency and selectivity of Ac-DNLDMCA for caspases-3, -7, -8, and -9, in vitro caspase activity
assays were performed. One unit (the amount of enzyme
that cleaves 1 nmol of substrate per hr) of each active
recombinant human caspase was added to a reaction mixture containing 200 μM Ac-DNLD-MCA or Ac-DEVDMCA in assay buffer (100 mM NaCl, 50 mM HEPES, 10
mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% CHAPS,
pH 7.4). Then, the liberation of MCA was monitored continuously at 37°C using a 96-well plate reader Wallace
1420 ARVOsx (PerkinElmer) with an excitation wavelength of 390 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm.
Construction of expression vectors of HA tagged p17 or
p12 subunits of caspase-3
Human cDNA fragments containing p17 or p12 subunits
of caspase-3 were generated by PCR from Jurkat cells. The
primers used were p17, 5'-TCTGGAATATCCCTGGACAA
C-3' (sense) and 5'-TTAGTCTGTCTCAATGCCACAGTC-3'
(antisense); p12,5'-AGTGGT GTTGATGATGACATG-3'
(sense) and 5'-TTAGTGATAAAAATAGAGTTC-3' (antisense). The amino-terminus of p17 or p12 were tagged
with the HA epitope by PCR using the primers, 5'-CTCGAGCCACCATGTACCCATAC-3' (sense) and 5'-AGCG-

PCR products were then subcloned into pcDNA3 B (Invitrogen) at the EcoRV site. After confirming the sequences,
the inserts were excised by XhoI digestion and recloned
into the XhoI site of pURE4 (Post Genome Institute Co.,
Ltd.).
Site-directed mutagenesis of p12 subunit
Site-directed mutagenesis of p12 subunit (S209A) was
introduced using PCR. The following primers were used
for the preparation of the mutant, 5'-AGTGGTGTTGATGA
TGACATG-3' (position 176–208, sense) and 5'-ATTTCGCCAAGAATAATAACC-3' (position 176–208, antisense);
5'-GCAAAGGATGGCTCCTGGTTCATC-3'
(position 209–277, sense) and 5'-TTAGTGATAAAAATAGAGTTC-3' (position 209–277, antisense). The mutated
site (Ser209→Ala) was shown in bold letter. After each
fragments were amplified and ligated, they were tagged
with HA and subcloned into pcDNA3 B (Invitrogen) at
the EcoRV site. After comfirming the sequences, the inserts
were excited by XhoI digestion and recloned into the XhoI
site of pURE4 (Post Genome Institute Co., Ltd.)
Generation of active caspase-3
Active caspase-3 was generated by coexpression of HAp17 and HA-p12 (wild type or mutant) subunits in vitro
using PURESYSTEM classic II (Post Genome Institute Co.,
Ltd.) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Western blot analysis
Two μl aliquots of proteins (wild type or mutant) were
subjected to 15% SDS/polyacrylamide gel and transferred
onto PVDF transfer-membranes. Blots were blocked in
TBST [20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 400 mM NaCl, and
0.05% (w/v) Triton X-100] containing 2.5% (w/v) BSA for
1.5 h and probed with anti-HA antibody (Bethyl Laboratories, Inc.). After the membrane were washed with TBST,
retained antibody was detected with anti-rabbit IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate and a Prote Blot Western
detection kit (Promega).
Construction of phylogenetic tree
The amino acid sequences of the seven full-length human
caspases retrieved from the Swiss-Prot database (accession
numbers: caspase-2, P42575; caspase-3, P42574; caspase6, P55212; caspase-7, P55210; caspase-8, Q14790; caspase-9, P55211; caspase-10, Q92851) were aligned using
the Clustal W multiple alignment program [44], and then
adjusted manually. Multiple alignment using the BLOSUM matrix series [45], a gap opening penalty of 11.0,
and a gap extension penalty of 0.05 were chosen for aligning the sequences. Based on the alignment, a phylogenetic
tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining (NJ) algo-

rithms [35]. To establish a classification for the active sites
of caspases, phylogenetic analysis of the active site residues was conducted by the NJ algorithm (exclude positions with gaps). Bootstrap analysis was performed on
1000 random samples and analyzed by the Clustal W
[44]. The NJ analyses were displayed using NJ plot [46].

chains of the inhibitors. Rotational bonds in the inhibitors were assigned with the program AutoTors [34]. All
torsions except the peptide bonds were unconstrained
during the docking. Based on the docking data, the lowest-energy docking mode was used to analyze the potency
and selectivity of the caspase-3 peptide inhibitors.

Computational molecular modelling
Molecular visualization was carried out in a DS ViewerPro
(Accelrys, Inc., San Diego, CA). The coordinates of caspases-3, -7, -8, and -9 were obtained from the Protein
Data Bank (PDB) (codes 1PAU, 1F1J, 1F9E, and 1JXQ).
Water was removed from the PDB files. The crystal structures of caspases-3, -7, -8, and -9 include coordinates of
Ac-DEVD-CHO, Ac-DEVD-CHO, Z-DEVD-CHO, and
Glu-Val-Dehydroxymethylaspartic acid, respectively, as
inhibitors. Since it is known that Ac-DEVD-CHO potently
inhibits the activities of caspases [31], we constructed the
models of the Ac-DEVD-CHO/caspase complex. To construct the complex structure of caspase-8/Ac-DEVD-CHO,
the benzyloxy-carbonyl group of Z-DEVD-CHO was displaced by the acetyl group on the DS ViewerPro. The complex structure of Ac-DEVD-CHO/caspase-9 was
constructed by superposition with that of the Ac-DEVDCHO/caspase-8. The superposition was performed using
the McLaghlan algorithm [47] as implemented in the
ProFit program [48]. The geometries of these complex
structures were subsequently optimized using the
GROMACS program [49,50]. The coordinate of Ac-DEVDCHO was converted to a GROMACS topology file by the
Dundee PRODRG2 Server [51]. Energy minimizations of
the complex structures using a GROMACS forcefield were
performed with the steepest descent algorithm.

Computational molecular docking
Molecular docking was carried out using AutoDock3.0
[34] on a COMPAQ Alphastation DS20E (double 833
MHz processors and 1024 MB of memory). The binding
free energy scoring function in the AutoDock is based on
an empirical function derived by linear regression analysis
of a large set of diverse protein-ligand complexes with
known inhibition constants. There are many successful
examples of structures of protein-ligand systems studied
by the AutoDock program [52,53]. The docking energy
grid (grid maps with 60 × 60 × 60 points, grid spacing
0.375 Å) was produced with the AutoGrid program [34].
The inhibitor centers in the complex structures were positioned at the grid center. The Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm was utilized, and energy evaluations were set at 3 ×
106. Each simulation was performed a total of 20 times.
Other parameters were default values. The initial conformations of caspase-3 inhibitors, Ac-DNLD-CHO, AcDEVD-CHO, Ac-DQTD-CHO, and Ac-DMQD-CHO, were
built using coordinates that replaced the side chains of the
