Abstract

Genome Biology 2006, 7:R48

information

Conclusion: The analysis results suggest that the transcriptional response to EGFR signaling in the
SCN may be partly mediated by established transcription-factors regulated via EGFR transriptionfactors (AP1, Ets1, C/EBP), transcription-factors involved in circadian clock entrainment (CREB),
and by core clock transcription-factors (Rorα). Quantitative real-time PCR measurements of
several transcription-factor expression levels support a model in which circadian time-dependent
EGFR responses are partly achieved by circadian regulation of upstream signaling components. Our
study suggests an important role for EGFR signaling in SCN function and provides an example for
gaining physiological insights through systems-level analysis.

Results: We have undertaken a systems-level analysis of EGFR circadian time-dependent signaling
in the SCN. We collected gene-expression profiles to study how the SCN response to EGFR
activation depends on circadian timing. Mixed-model analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed
to identify genes with circadian time-dependent EGFR regulation. The expression data were
integrated with transcription-factor binding predictions through gene group enrichment analyses
to generate robust hypotheses about transcription-factors responsible for the circadian phasedependent EGFR responses.

Background: Identifying the gene regulatory networks governing physiological signal integration
remains an important challenge in circadian biology. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has
been implicated in circadian function and is expressed in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), the core
circadian pacemaker. The transcription networks downstream of EGFR in the SCN are unknown
but, by analogy to other SCN inputs, we expect the response to EGFR activation to depend on
circadian timing.

Background

The present work makes a systems level analysis of contextdependent signaling by the epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). Circadian
rhythms are driven by gene regulatory feedback networks [1],
and in mammals the SCN comprise the master circadian clock
[2]. SCN circadian rhythms are synchronized across SCN
neurons [3], with the environment, and with the internal
physiological state of the organism [4]. Importantly, the
effects of phase modulating extracellular inputs to the SCN
are regulated by the circadian clock itself and are thus 'gated'
[5] or circadian time dependent. Biochemical correlates of
light (for example, glutamate), for instance, have little effect
during the circadian day, but cause phase delays in the early
night, and phase advances in the late night [5]. The mechanisms behind circadian time dependent signaling in the SCN
are largely unknown, but mechanisms that in other systems
give rise to signaling specificity - cell-type specific responses
to the activation of common signaling pathways (reviewed in
[6,7]) - may be partly responsible. Phases of differential SCN
signaling responsiveness cycle with circadian time, however,
and thus components responsible for circadian modulation of
signaling responses must also cycle with circadian time, rendering the SCN a particularly interesting and well-contained
system for studying context-dependent signaling.
Recent studies suggest important roles for EGFR signaling in
the regulation of circadian rhythms by the SCN. EGFR and
EGFR ligands are expressed throughout the central nervous
system and are involved in diverse developmental and homeostatic processes [8]. SCN expression of EGFR [9-11] and
transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha; an EGFR ligand) [9,10,12,13] have been reported. EGFR signaling has
been implicated in the circadian regulation of locomotor
activity [13] and grooming, exploring, and feeding behaviors
[14]. EGFR activation has been found to induce Erk phosphorylation in the SCN [15]. Elevated TGF-alpha serum levels
have been observed in cancer patients with dampened circadian activity rhythms [16]. Furthermore, roles have been suggested for EGFR signaling in clock regulation via retinal SCN
inputs [13] and the intercellular synchronization of SCN
rhythms [10]. Lastly, a microarray study of SCN circadian
gene expression revealed rhythmic EGFR substrate expression [17]. The signaling pathways downstream of EGFR are
uncharacterized in the SCN, but by analogy to other wellcharacterized SCN inputs [5], and studies in other systems of
context-dependent EGFR signaling [18], we hypothesize that
the EGFR signaling in the SCN is circadian time dependent.
In this work, a preliminary characterization of the transcriptional pathways underlying circadian time dependent EGFR
signaling in the SCN is made. Factorial-designed microarray
experiments [19] are combined with mixed-model analysis of
variance (ANOVA) [20], enrichment analyses, and promoter
bioinformatic techniques [21] to generate hypotheses about
the transcription factors (TFs) regulating genes with circa-

dian time dependent expression responses to EGFR activation. This work is consistent with others in which microarray
analysis was combined with promoter analysis to generate
hypotheses about the TFs regulating circadian gene expression [22], and expression responses to specific signaling pathways [23,24]. We extended the methods of these previous
works by performing thorough microarray and promoter
analyses and by seeking results that were both statistically
significant and robust to variations in analysis parameters,
following recommendations in [25]. We found strong support
for circadian time dependent EGFR responses in the SCN,
and quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR measurements of a
subset of implicated TFs revealed that circadian time dependent EGFR responses may be partly due to circadian modulation of upstream signaling pathways.

Results and discussion

The objectives of the current study were to identify genes
responsive to EGFR signaling in the SCN, to determine
whether these responses are circadian time dependent, to
identify the pathways and functions modulated by EGFR signaling in the SCN, and to make hypotheses about the regulators responsible for the EGFR responses. To these ends, a 22
factorial designed microarray experiment was performed in
which the SCN responses to EGF treatment during the 'day' (8
hours after lights on) and 'night' (2 hours after lights off) were
compared. Genes with expression levels regulated by EGFR
signaling in a circadian time dependent manner were identified using mixed-model ANOVA. To generate hypotheses
about the pathways and cell functions modulated by EGFR
signaling in the SCN, we tested for enrichments of previously
established circadian gene expression [17,22] and Gene
Ontology (GO) terms in groups of EGF responsive genes. To
generate hypotheses about the regulators underlying the circadian time dependent EGFR responses in the SCN, we tested
for enrichment of TF binding predictions in the promoters of
EGF responsive gene groups. Given that TF binding site databases are currently incomplete, with the number of known or
predicted TFs greatly exceeding the number of well-characterized TF binding sites, and given that the quality and specificity of binding sites differs across databases and data sets, we
sought consistent hypotheses by utilizing three complementary sources of TF binding predictions: the TRANSFAC®
database [26], predictions based on phylogenetic conservation [27], and genome-wide location analysis data [28,29]. By
seeking consistent results from complementary data sources,
we feel we overcome some of the limitations in relying on TF
binding site predictions to infer regulatory networks, even
though identifying the specific TFs acting at implicated binding sites remains an important challenge.
Our experiments and analyses provide evidence for circadian-time dependent EGFR responses that are relevant to circadian clock function. Additionally, we identified several TFs

EGFR modulation of circadian cycling genes in the SCN
To determine whether the EGF responsive genes we identified have a role in core clock function, we compared them to
previously established circadian cycling genes in the SCN
[17,22]. Specifically, we tested whether circadian-regulated
genes were over-represented in our EGF-responsive gene

information

At a false discovery rate (FDR) of 2%, approximately 10% of
the genes on our microarrays were EGF responsive. Heatmaps showing the diversity of observed expression responses
to EGFR activation are given in Figure 1. Interestingly, the
majority (approximately 70%) of the EGF-responsive genes
had EGF responses that depended in some way on the circadian time at which the EGF treatment was made. These were
identified in the mixed model ANOVA as those with statistically significant EGF:circadian time (EGF:CT) interaction
effects on gene expression levels (see Materials and methods).
While the genes on our microarrays are not necessarily representative of the entire genome, these results suggest that: (1)

did not find statistically significant enrichment for circadian
genes identified in [22] for any of our EGF responsive gene
groups. For the rhythmic SCN genes identified in [17], however, we observed enrichments in select EGF responsive subsets (Table 1, marked 'Circ.'). Using a gene significance cutoff
of 10% FDR, the overall EGF responsive gene set was
enriched for circadian genes (pENRICH < 0.05, pM(LOCAL) <

Similarly, the genes with CT-dependent EGF responses were
enriched for circadian genes (pENRICH < 0.05, pM(LOCAL) <

bioprocesses that are relevant to circadian clock function.
That we found enrichments for one set of circadian genes and
not another is not troublesome given the substantial differences between these lists [30]. P values for EGF effects and
EGF:CT interactions for the circadian cycling genes identified

cadian clock regulates regulators of CREB activity [33].
Lastly, the role for CREB in circadian rhythm modulation by
EGFR signaling (predicted presently) is supported by previous work in which intraperitoneal EGF injections reduced
phosphorylated CREB levels in the esophagus and phase
shifted esophageal circadian DNA synthesis rhythms [34].
Genes with circadian time dependent EGF responses were
robustly significantly enriched for binding site family predictions of other EGFR target TFs. These include: CRE-BP1 [35],
with CRE-BP1:c-Jun family sites enriched at pENRICH < 0.02
and pM(LOCAL) < 0.02); and c-Ets1 [36], with c-Ets-1/68 family
sites enriched at pENRICH < 0.1 and pM(LOCAL) < 0.06. Lastly,
50% of the genes on our arrays with CREBATF family binding
sites had significant EGF:CT interactions, a highly significant
(pENRICH < 0.001) 5.7-fold enrichment over random that was
also locally robust (pM(LOCAL) < 0.02).

TF binding site predictions based on phylogenetic conservation
To supplement the results obtained using PAINT, we tested
for robust statistically significant enrichments of TF binding
site predictions based on phylogenetic conservation from
[27]. Since these conserved sites were reported for human
genes, we mapped them to the rat genes on our arrays using
Homologene [37]. Given the large number of TF binding site
predictions obtained using this method, robust statistically
significant enrichments were defined using more stringent
cutoffs than for PAINT (pENRICH < 0.03 and pM(LOCAL) < 0.06).
Results for the gene groups defined at FDR <2% are shown in
Table 1 (marked 'CONS').
The predicted TF binding site most significantly and robustly
enriched was V$RORA1_01 (vertebrate RORα1 matrix 1),
which was enriched in the superset of EGF-responsive genes
(pENRICH < 1 × 10-4, pM(LOCAL) < 5 × 10-4, pM(GLOBAL) < 5 × 10-3),
genes with EGF:CT interactions (pENRICH < 5 × 10-4, pM(LOCAL)
< 5 × 10-3, pM(GLOBAL) < 5 × 10-3), and genes responsive to EGF
only during the night (pENRICH < 2 × 10-3, pM(LOCAL) < 0.01,
pM(GLOBAL) < 0.05). Effectively, significant enrichment for
V$RORA1_01 sites was independent of the significance cutoff
used to define gene groups and even the method used to normalize the array data (of those considered). Although the TFs
that bind RORα1 sites are not established targets of EGFR
signaling, two of them (Rorα and Rev-erb-alpha) are essential
components of the circadian clock gene network in the SCN
[22,38,39]. Involvement of Rorα binding sites in the circadian time dependent transcriptional response of the SCN to
EGFR may provide a direct link between EGFR signaling in
the SCN and the core clock.
Binding site predictions for CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) TFs, some of which are known targets of EGFR
signaling in other systems [40,41], were also robustly significantly enriched in the promoters of EGF-responsive gene
groups. V$CEBP_Q2 and V$CEBP_Q3, respective binding
sites for C/EBPα and the C/EBP family broadly, were

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/6/R48

enriched in the EGF-responsive superset, genes with EGF:CT
interactions, and genes regulated by EGF during the night
only; whereas V$CEBPGAMMA_Q6 was robustly significantly enriched in the EGF-responsive superset and genes
with circadian time independent EGF responses. These
results suggest differential utilization of C/EBP TFs downstream of EGFR signaling in the SCN to achieve circadian
time dependent and circadian time independent responses.
Recent work showing core clock gene induction by C/EBPα in
other systems [42] supports a role of C/EBPα in circadian
signaling.
Many enrichment results obtained using phylogenetically
conserved binding site predictions [27] corroborated those
from PAINT, strengthening regulatory hypotheses. Robust
and significant enrichments for c-Ets1 binding sites were
found in EGF:CT interaction genes: for PAINT, c-Ets-1/68
family sites were enriched, while phylogenetic conservation
predictions yielded V$CETS1P54_01 enrichment. Using
PAINT, CRE-BP1:c-Jun family sites were enriched in EGF:CT
interaction genes, while phylogenetic conservation predictions yielded enrichment for V$CREBP1_Q2 in that same
gene group and robust significant enrichment for
V$CREBP1_01 in the genes responsive to EGF during the
night only. Enrichment results obtained using PAINT and
phylogenetic conservation jointly support a hypothesis for the
involvement of c-Jun, a component of the EGFR activated TF
AP1 [43], in the SCN EGFR response, given the enrichments
of CRE-BP1:c-Jun family sites and the AP1 consensus site
(V$AP1_C) in the EGF:CT interaction genes obtained using
those methods, respectively. Finally, significant enrichment
of specific phylogenetically conserved CREB binding sites
(V$CREB_Q2, V$CREB_Q4, and V$CREB_Q4_01) was
found for genes with EGF:CT interactions that were responsive both during the day and night - approximately 50% of the
genes in this group had either the V$CREB_Q4 or
V$CREB_Q4_01 in their promoters. Since this gene group is
a subset of the gene groups for which CREB family enrichments were observed using PAINT, these enrichments provide additional support for CREB involvement.

TF binding predictions from protein-DNA interaction data
As a final step in generating regulatory hypotheses, we tested
for experimentally established TF promoter binding enrichment in the EGF-regulated gene groups. The available mammalian system-wide protein-DNA interaction data are
limited, but the location analysis studies in [28,29] provide
genome-wide promoter binding predictions for CREB and
three hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) family members in
human non-neuronal cells, respectively. To utilize these data
in our study, we mapped the human gene data to the rat genes
on our arrays using Homologene. Enrichment results for gene
groups defined at FDR <2% are shown in Table 1 (marked
'ChIP').

Previous studies have suggested that expression profile correlations may be indicative of functional regulatory relationships between TFs and their target genes [47]. While we have
demonstrated that gene dynamics may lead to more complex
relationships between TF and target expression patterns in
some conditions [48], we nevertheless undertook an analysis
to test for significant correlations between the selected TFs
and the EGF responsive gene groups. Specifically, we tested

In spite of the fact that the protein-DNA interaction data are
for non-neuronal human cells, moderate enrichments were
observed for HNF1-alpha and CREB in our gene groups,
although neither were robust to the significance threshold for
gene expression effects (pM(LOCAL) > 0.15 for both TFs) or variations in the normalization method (pM(GLOBAL) > 0.20 for
both TFs). Significant enrichment (pENRICH < 0.04) of HNF1alpha, an EGF-regulated TF in some systems [44], was
observed in the genes with circadian time dependent EGF
responses. Fifty percent of the genes with EGF:CT interactions were bound by CREB in at least one condition in the
data from [28], a 1.7-fold enrichment over random that is significant at a low level (pENRICH < 0.12). Taken with the
robustly statistically significant CREB enrichments obtained
using PAINT and phylogenetic conservation TF binding site
predictions, this result provides additional support for the

c-Jun was weakly but consistently down-regulated (pEGF ≤
0.06) in response to EGF treatment during the day and the
night. Creb1 and c-Ets1, however, were down-regulated in
response to EGF during the day and up-regulated by EGF
during the night (both 1.5-fold). These responses were statistically significant (pEGF:CT < 5 × 10-5 for Creb1 and pEGF:CT < 5
× 10-3 for c-Ets1). C/EBPα was consistently up-regulated during the circadian night only (pEGF:CT < 0.05, 4-fold induction),
while C/EBPβ was consistently down-regulated during the
circadian day only (pEGF:CT < 5 × 10-3, 3-fold repression).
Although we did not detect C/EBPγ expression in one of our
daytime EGF-treated samples, we found it to be weakly
repressed by EGFR signaling in a CT-independent manner
(pEGF < 0.05). We did not observe any statistically significant
effects on Rorα and Rorβ expression. Interestingly, significant CT effects on expression (in the absence of EGF) were
not observed for any of the TFs considered. It is possible that
transcripts for these TFs do cycle with circadian time, but
were not detected as such because of our choice of circadian
time points or because the changes are small relative to the
animal-animal variability. In spite of these possibilities, we
will base our subsequent regulatory hypotheses on our inability to detect circadian expression changes and will leave further verification for future studies. We also note that we
observed Creb1 expression responses even though CREB is
generally considered a constitutive TF [45]. Although rare,
there are examples of Creb1 gene expression changes in
response to extracellular stimuli in neurons [46]. The novel
changes observed in the current study warrant further
investigation.

expression was strongly correlated with expression profiles of putative
circadian time dependent target gene groups whereas c-Ets1 expression
was more weakly, but nevertheless significantly, correlated with those
gene groups. c-Jun was predicted to regulate target genes in a circadian
time dependent manner but has a circadian time independent expression
response that is significantly correlated with the circadian time
independent gene group. C/EBPβ expression was significantly correlated
with putative daytime C/EBP target genes while C/EBPα expression was
significantly correlated with putative C/EBP target nighttime responsive
genes. Black squares indicate the absence of statistically significant
correlations whereas orange squares indicate the presence of statistically
significant correlations. Correlation strength is represented by color
intensity, with the lowest significant average absolute correlation being 0.5
(between C/EBPα and the overall EGF responsive gene set) and the highest
significant average absolute correlation being 0.9 (between Creb1 and the
genes responsive to EGF during the day and the night). Images for (a) and
(b) were created using the free program Treeview [62].

As a preliminary experimental validation of the gene group
enrichment analysis results, we tested using qRT-PCR for differential expression of several TFs with robustly enriched
binding sites. Given the possibility of post-transcriptional TF
regulation, however, negative results do not necessarily invalidate the enrichment results. Based on the robust significant
enrichments for binding site predictions, Creb1, c-Ets1, cJun, C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, C/EBPγ, Ror α and Ror β were
selected for validation. Results of the qRT-PCR validation
experiments are discussed below and shown in Figure 2 and

whether the average absolute value of the correlations
between TF expression profiles and the EGF responsive gene
groups were greater than the correlations between the TFs
and random gene groups of the same size. We observed statistically significant (p < 0.01) correlations between the implicated TFs and the EGF responsive gene groups in the SCN for
all TFs considered except C/EBPγ (Figure 2b). As discussed
above, we found multiple lines of evidence supporting a role
for CREB in regulating the CT-dependent EGF responses in
the SCN. Further support for this relationship was given by
significant correlations between the Creb1 expression profile
and the expression profiles of genes in the gene groups
enriched for CREB-related binding sites (p = 5 × 10-4 in all
cases). We also observed significant correlation between the
c-Ets1 expression profile and the profiles of the CT-dependent
EGF responsive gene group that was enriched for c-Ets1
related binding sites (p = 5 × 10-4); between the C/EBPα
expression profile and the profiles of the gene group that was
EGF responsive during the night only and was enriched for C/
EBP related binding sites (p = 5 × 10-4); and between the C/
EBPβ expression profile and the profiles of the gene group
that was EGF responsive during the day only that was
enriched for C/EBP related binding sites (p = 5 × 10-4). It
must be noted that significant correlations between these TFs
and gene groups that were not enriched for their binding sites
were also observed, demonstrating potential limitations in
relying solely on expression profile correlations to link TFs to
their targets [48]. Interestingly, the correlation between cJun and the genes with CT-independent EGF responses was
statistically significant (p = 5 × 10-4), even though this gene
group was not enriched for c-Jun related binding sites. It is
thus likely that CT-dependent post-transcriptional mechanisms are responsible for the CT-dependent target gene regulation that appears to involve this TF.
A plausible hypothesis to explain the putative circadian time
dependent regulation of EGFR target genes by these TFs is
that they are available to be regulated by EGFR signaling at
some circadian times but not others. This mechanism for context-dependent regulation has been observed previously [7]
and would be supported by strong circadian variation in TF
mRNA levels. The qRT-PCR results for the TFs considered,
showing no significant circadian variation in gene expression,
do not support this hypothesis, and an alternative mechanism
is required. The expression responses of Creb1, c-Ets1, C/
EBPα, and C/EBP β to EGF treatment were themselves circadian time dependent, and it is thus possible that these expression changes partially account for the putative circadian time
dependent regulation of target genes by these TFs. In this
case, the circadian clock must modulate the upstream signaling pathways that lead to their gene regulation. c-Jun expression regulation by EGF at the mRNA level was circadian time
independent and thus cannot account for circadian time
dependent gene-expression regulation downstream of EGFR.

Conclusion

Our factorial-designed microarray experiments, mixedmodel ANOVA, gene group enrichment analyses, meta-analyses, and qRT-PCR validations provide insight into the regulation of circadian time dependent EGFR signaling in the
SCN. Even though the arrays that we used were relatively
small in scale, the extensive functional annotation of the
genes allowed us to perform gene group enrichment analyses
from which regulatory hypotheses were derived. Several of
the hypotheses are consistent across the different TF binding
predictions utilized, giving us greater confidence that they
provide clues to the underlying biology. By performing metaanalyses of our enrichment results, we were able to identify
results that were robust to small variations in the significance
thresholds and normalization procedures and, therefore,
potentially more reflective of the underlying biological waves
of regulation.
The extensive literature information about EGFR signaling in
other systems allowed us to put many enrichment analysis
results into appropriate context. The regulatory hypotheses
we developed, based on our microarray experiments, GO
information, several sources of TF binding predictions, qRTPCR experiments, and the literature, are summarized in Figure 3. Interestingly, the two TF binding sites that were most
strongly enriched in all of the analyses, CREB and RORA1, are
very similar to the two significant binding sites identified in a
previous promoter bioinformatics study of genes with circadian expression patterns in the SCN [22], providing additional evidence for a link between SCN EGFR signaling and
the core circadian gene regulatory network. Our results support a functional role of EGFR signaling in the circadian
clock, give insights into the mechanisms underlying functional input integration in the SCN, and provide a framework
for further analysis of this important physiological process.

Materials and methods
Experimental design
We investigated the difference in SCN gene expression
between 'day' (8 hours after lights on) and 'night' (2 hours
after lights off) following EGFR activation by EGF treatment.
Circadian phase shifts induced by other stimuli have been
reported at these time points [5], rendering them good candidates for interrogating EGFR-induced gene expression. Two
SCN were obtained from each rat for EGF-treated and vehicle-treated samples. Pairing control and treated samples from
the same rat permitted detection of EGF effects in the presence of substantial animal-to-animal variability. SCN from

Figure 3
Hypothesized regulatory interactions that partially account for circadian time dependent EGFR transcriptional responses in the SCN. Modulation of the
SCN gene expression response to EGFR activation (via EGF) by the circadian clock was investigated in the present study. We identified groups of genes
with both CT-dependent and CT-independent expression responses, and these groups were enriched for specific cellular functions and the presence of
specific TF binding sites in their promoters. Genes with CT-independent EGF responses were enriched for serine/threonine kinase activity and for C/EBPγ
binding sites in their promoters. Given their CT-independent responses, and given that we observed weak CT-independent C/EBPγ expression responses
to EGF, it is plausible that the EGFR-regulated signaling pathways responsible for their induction through C/EBPγ-dependent and -independent mechanisms
function independently of the circadian clock. Genes with CT-dependent responses were enriched for involvement in cellular differentiation processes and
the presence of c-Ets1, AP1, C/EBP, RORα, and CREB binding sites. Although RORα is a direct regulatory target of the circadian clock, we did not
observe CT or EGFR expression responses for this gene and, thus, it may cause EGF induced CT-dependent gene regulation through post-transcriptional
mechanisms. On the other hand, we did observe CT-dependent EGFR expression responses of c-Ets1, Creb1, C/EBPα, and C/EBPβ, constituting a
mechanism by which these genes may cause CT-dependent expression responses of their target genes, and indicating that these TFs must be regulated by
CT-dependent pathways. Interestingly, c-Jun EGFR expression responses were CT-independent, indicating that it must regulate CT-dependent expression
responses through CT-dependent post-transcriptional mechanisms. Solid lines indicate direct interactions, dotted lines represent indirect CT-independent
interactions, and dashed lines represent indirect CT-dependent interactions. CREB is emphasized given the strong support provided by multiple
independent analyses for its involvement in the EGFR response.

separated by the third ventricle. Slices were separated along the third ventricle and placed in media containing EGF (20 nM) or control vehicle (C) for one

Normalization of microarray data was performed using a random effects ANOVA model with terms for slide, subarray, and
slide:subarray interactions, similar to [53,54]. Following
[54], additional normalization was accomplished by scaling
the ANOVA model residuals with the subarray specific standard deviations to standardize the dispersion. This two-step
normalization procedure is referred to as 'standard normalization' throughout the manuscript. Computations were performed using the package NLME [20] in the statistical
analysis environment R [55].

Hypotheses for SCN circadian time dependent EGF signaling
regulation were generated by testing EGF-responsive gene
groups for enrichment of functional attributes. Evidence for
modulation of core circadian clock function by EGFR signaling was obtained by testing for enrichments of established
SCN circadian genes [17,22] in the EGF responsive gene
groups. Cellular process/function hypotheses were generated
from GO term enrichments. Transcriptional regulatory
hypotheses were based on enrichments of predicted TF binding activities, referred to as transcriptional regulatory network analysis. Three sources of TF binding predictions were
used: TRANSFAC Pro database of TF binding sites with the
MATCH tool [26] as automated using PAINT [21]; predictions based on phylogenetic conservation of TF binding sites
from [27]; and protein-DNA interaction data for CREB [28]
and three HNF family members [29]. Genes too long to show
differential transcription induced expression changes after
one hour of EGF treatment were excluded from the transcriptional regulatory network analysis (genes >75,000 base pairs
(bp), assuming 1,500 bp/minute elongation [57] and 10
minute processing [58]). Fisher's exact test was used to compute enrichment p values (pENRICH), using all microarray
genes as the reference, following [21]. Gene attributes (GO or
TF binding) not present in at least five genes in a particular
gene group were not tested. Fisher's test p values were FDR
adjusted based on [59]. Further enrichment analysis details

Hierarchical analysis approach
Hierarchical analysis approach. Genes were first classified as EGF
responsive by performing a likelihood ratio test to compare the fits of
maximum likelihood estimated mixed models with and without EGF
terms. EGF responsive genes were then classified as to whether or not
they had a significant EGF:CT interaction, as determined by a Wald F-test
of the REML estimated full model. EGF responsive genes with EGF:CT
interactions were then classified according to whether they were
responsive to EGF during the day only, during the night only, or at both
times. Genes with significant EGF:CT interactions were then subdivided
according to the directionality ofthe responses.

Meta-analysis of enrichments
Enrichment of GO or TF binding sites in different gene groups
can depend nonlinearly on the parameters used to define significantly differentially expressed gene groups [25]. Furthermore, microarray results can depend somewhat on the
normalization approach employed [54]. Ideally, enrichment
results will reflect waves of regulation and, therefore, will be
robust to small variations in significance cut offs and normalization techniques. To identify enrichment results insensitive
to these variables, we supplemented the gene group analyses
by computing two additional p values, pM(LOCAL) and pM(GLOBAL), which are local and global meta-analysis p values,
respectively. pM(LOCAL) is the geometric mean (GM) of the
enrichment p values (pENRICH) computed for gene groups
defined using three cut offs for significance for the standard
normalization. pM(GLOBAL) is the GM of the enrichment p values computed for gene groups defined using the three significance cut offs and 8 slightly different normalization
techniques, a total of 24 conditions. Attributes with low values of pM(LOCAL) and pM(GLOBAL) are 'robustly enriched' because
their overall enrichment is not dependent on a particular significance cut off or normalization. The cut off for 'locally
robust enrichment' was pM(LOCAL) < 0.06 while it was pM(GLO-

Expression levels of TFs implicated in circadian time dependent responses to EGF in the SCN (c-Jun, c-Ets1, Creb1, C/
EBPα, C/EBPβ, C/EBPγ, Rorα and Rorβ) were measured
using qRT-PCR. Fyn was used as a housekeeping control gene
given that two independent Fyn clones had no significant
EGF or circadian time effects and relatively small experimental variability on our microarrays. aRNA from the microarray
samples and two additional daytime samples were used for
qRT-PCR.
The analysis approach used for the qRT-PCR data was a combination of the '∆∆Ct' method [60] and the mixed-model
ANOVA employed for the microarray analysis. The approximate range of exponential growth for each gene in each well
was first determined from the amplification curves using a
procedure modified from [61].
Studentized residuals were used to detect the onset of the
exponential growth phase from the background subtracted
(DeltaRn) reaction curve. The beginning of exponential
growth was defined as the point after which four outlier
points were detected in a row at p <0.025. The termination of
the exponential growth phase was defined as the point at
which the slope of the log-transformed amplification curve
(as estimated using linear regression over a window of five
cycles) first differs from the initial slope of the exponential
phase (as estimated using linear regression over a window of
five cycles) with 95% confidence. Regressions and computations were performed using the stats package in the statistical
analysis environment R [55]. PCR reactions that did not
amplify (did not reach a raw intensity of 0.2) were excluded
from the analysis.
With regions of exponential growth defined for each gene in
each condition, it was possible to compute delta-cycle-thresholds (∆Cytg) for each gene (g) with respect to the housekeeping gene (h), such that:
∆Cytg (I) = Cytg(I) - Cyth(I)

(2)

where I is the 'threshold intensity' - the intensity of the amplification curve at which the cycle thresholds (Cyt) for each
gene and the housekeeping gene are estimated. If both the
housekeeping gene and the gene of interest are in exponential
phases with the same efficiency, the ∆Cytg should not depend
on I and will be proportional to -log2 the relative expression
level (-log2([g]/ [h])) if the efficiencies are perfect (= 2),
where [g] is the transcript concentration of the gene of interest and [h] is the transcript concentration of the housekeeping gene. ∆Cytg, however, generally shows some weak
nonlinear dependence on I. Estimation of the exponential
phases allows identification of the intensity regions where

The terms on the right-hand side of Equation 3 have the same
meaning as the terms in Equation 1, except that l, the index
associated with spots (nested within rats), has been replaced
with the index m, an index associated with PCR plates or PCR
plate quadrants in which measurements were taken. Since
measurements of all conditions were obtained on each PCR
plate, PCR plates are not nested in rats. The parameters in
Equation 3 were estimated for each gene using REML. Wald
F tests were then performed to determine whether any of the

∆Cytg, av was computed as described above for each gene for
each condition on each PCR plate used in the measurements.
To account for any plate or plate-region specific bias, the
mean ∆Cytg, av across all conditions for gene (g) on the same
plate or region was subtracted, to give normalized (∆Cytg,
norm) values for analysis. The qRT-PCR data retain the factorial mixed-effects structure of the microarray data, and for
this reason mixed model ANOVA was again employed to
identify statistically significant effects on gene expression.
Specifically, the following model was used (where the subscripts on ∆Cytg, norm have been removed for clarity):

comment

amplicons for both the housekeeping gene and the gene of
interest are undergoing exponential growth. If that overlap
spans several PCR cycles for both genes, multiple estimates of
∆Cytg can be obtained by interpolation of the amplification
curves. This was true in all cases presently. For each gene of
interest in each condition, the amplification curves were
interpolated on an exponential scale in the region of overlap
with the housekeeping gene to obtain n + 1 estimates of ∆Cytg,
where n is the minimum number PCR cycles (between the
gene of interest and the housekeeping gene) where overlap of
the exponential phases occurs. The multiple estimates of
∆Cytg(I) were used to compute an overall average ∆Cytg, av
that was used in the subsequent analyses.
