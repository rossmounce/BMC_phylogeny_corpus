Abstract
Background: Oseltamivir is the preferred antiviral drug for influenza, but oseltamivir-resistant A(H1N1) viruses have
circulated worldwide since the 2007-2008 influenza season. We aimed to determine the rate of oseltamivir
resistance among A(H1N1) isolates from Yamagata, Japan, to compare the virological characteristics between
isolates from the 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 seasons, and to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of oseltamivir.
Results: Oseltamivir resistance, determined by detecting the H275Y mutation in the neuraminidase (NA) gene, was
observed in 2.5% (2 of 79) and 100% (77 of 77) of isolates from the 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 seasons, respectively.
Antigenic analysis suggested that antigenically different variants of A(H1N1) viruses circulated in the 2008-2009
season. Growth testing demonstrated that the ability of the 2008-2009 isolates to replicate in MDCK cells was
similar to those of the oseltamivir-susceptible isolates from the 2007-2008 season. A phylogenetic analysis revealed
that two oseltamivir-resistant viruses isolated in the 2007-2008 season were closely related to other oseltamivirsusceptible viruses in Yamagata but were different from oseltamivir-resistant viruses isolated in Europe and North
America in the 2007-2008 season. The oseltamivir-resistant viruses isolated in Japan in the 2008-2009 season were
phylogenetically similar to oseltamivir-resistant isolates from Europe and North America during the 2007-2008
season. Furthermore, the median duration of fever after the start of oseltamivir treatment was significantly longer
in oseltamivir-resistant cases (2 days; range 1-6 days) than in oseltamivir-susceptible cases (1.5 days: range 1-2 days)
(P = 0.0356).
Conclusion: Oseltamivir-resistant A(H1N1) isolates from Yamagata in the 2007-2008 season might have acquired
resistance through the use of oseltamivir, and the 2008-2009 oseltamivir-resistant isolates might have been
introduced into Japan and circulated throughout the country. Influenza surveillance to monitor oseltamivirresistance would aid clinicians in determining an effective antiviral treatment strategy.

Background
During the 2007-2008 season, increased levels of resistance to oseltamivir among influenza A (H1N1) viruses
were reported in Europe and North America [1-6], and
oseltamivir-resistant viruses were also detected in the
southern hemisphere [7,8]. The frequency of oseltamivir* Correspondence: matuzaki@med.id.yamagata-u.ac.jp

resistance in A(H1N1) isolates was highest (67%) in Norway [9]. During the same season in Japan, it is estimated
that up to 2.6% of all influenza A(H1N1) isolates were
resistant to oseltamivir [10]. It was reported that some of
the resistant viruses found in Japan during the 2007-2008
season were not phylogenetically related to those found in
Europe and that these resistant isolates from Japan
emerged independently in Japan [11,12]. Further, during
the 2008-2009 season, the A(H1N1) virus was prominent

in influenza outbreaks in Japan, and national surveillance
showed that 99.6% of A(H1N1) isolates had the histidineto-tyrosine substitution at residue 275 (H275Y) of the
neuraminidase (NA) gene; this mutation is associated with
oseltamivir resistance [13]. Oseltamivir is widely used in
clinical settings in Japan. Therefore, an increase in oseltamivir-resistant influenza viruses is an important problem
that is likely to influence the treatment strategy for influenza virus infections.
The purposes of this study were to investigate the percentage of A(H1N1) isolates from Yamagata Prefecture
during the 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 seasons that had
the H275Y mutation in the NA gene and to compare the
virological characteristics between the A(H1N1) viruses
isolated in those seasons. Additionally, we evaluated the
clinical effectiveness of oseltamivir and zanamivir against
oseltamivir-resistant A(H1N1) virus infections.

Results
The percentage of influenza A(H1N1) virus isolates with
the H275Y mutation

A total of 156 isolates from the Yamagata prefecture
obtained between December 2007 and March 2008
(2007-2008 isolates) and between December 2008 and
March 2009 (2008-2009 isolates) were sequenced for the
identification of the H275Y mutation in the NA gene.
The sequencing results demonstrated that 2.5% of the
2007-2008 isolates and 100% of 2008-2009 isolates had
the H275Y mutation associated with oseltamivir resistance (Table 1).
The NA inhibition assay against oseltamivir and zanamivir

Seven isolates were tested for susceptibility to the NA
inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir. Two 2007-2008
isolates and two 2008-2009 isolates with the H275Y
mutation showed 234- to 1,968-fold reductions in susceptibility to oseltamivir when compared with three
2007-2008 isolates without the H275Y mutation (Table
2). However, the H275Y mutation had no impact on the
susceptibility to zanamivir.

resistant A(H1N1) viruses circulated in Yamagata in the
2008-2009 season.
Virus growth in MDCK cells

We compared the growth characteristics of oseltamivirresistant 2008-2009 isolates with those of oseltamivirsusceptible and -resistant 2007-2008 isolates. As shown
in Figure 1, the virus titers of A/Yamagata/126/2008
and A/Yamagata/128/2008, which were oseltamivirresistant 2008-2009 isolates, increased, as did those of
the oseltamivir-susceptible isolates from the 2007-2008
season. The two 2008-2009 isolates showed rapid
growth and A/Yamagata/126/2008 reached a more than
ten-fold higher final virus titer than did A/Yamagata/68/
2008, an oseltamivir-resistant virus from the 2007-2008
season.
Phylogenetic analysis of the HA and NA genes

Of the 156 A(H1N1) isolates, 13 isolates from the 20072008 season and 22 isolates from the 2008-2009 season
were used for the phylogenetic analysis. All of the 20072008 isolates belonged to two distinct lineages (2B and
2C) in the HA (Figure 2) and NA (Figure 3) gene trees.
Two oseltamivir-resistant 2007-2008 isolates, A/Yamagata/66/2008 and A/Yamagata/68/2008, were isolated
three days apart from two respective students from the
same elementary school who had not been treated with
oseltamivir prior to the specimen collection. The
nucleotide sequences of both the HA and NA genes of
these two viruses were identical, and these viruses
showed close genetic similarity to the oseltamivir-susceptible 2007-2008 isolates belonging to 2B. The

oseltamivir-resistant A(H1N1) viruses that emerged in
Europe in late 2007 are characterized by D354G amino
acid substitutions in the NA protein [2]. However, oseltamivir-resistant 2007-2008 isolates from Yamagata did
not have the D354G mutation in the NA gene.
On both the HA and NA phylogenetic trees, all oseltamivir-resistant 2008-2009 isolates from Yamagata
belonged to the 2B lineage and were more closely
related to the oseltamivir-resistant viruses isolated in
Europe and North America in the 2007-2008 season
than to the oseltamivir-resistant 2007-2008 isolates from
Yamagata. All 2008-2009 isolates have the D354G mutation in the NA gene and the A189T mutation in the
HA gene. Except for A/Yamagata/45/2008, all 20082009 isolates from Yamagata have an amino acid substitution at residue 185 (G185A, G185V, or G185S) of the
HA protein. This substitution might influence the
decrease in the reactivity with antiserum against A/Brisbane/59/2007.
Clinical effectiveness of oseltamivir and zanamivir

We investigated the clinical effectiveness of anti-influenza drugs by comparing the symptoms of children with
oseltamivir-susceptible influenza A(H1N1) virus infections during the 2007-2008 season to those of children
with oseltamivir-resistant influenza A(H1N1) virus infections during the 2008-2009 season (Table 4). We found
no significant differences in the age, maximum temperature, or total febrile period of oseltamivir-treated children between cases of the oseltamivir-susceptible and
oseltamivir-resistant influenza A(H1N1) virus infections.
However, for the children treated with oseltamivir, the

duration of fever after the start of treatment was significantly longer in children with oseltamivir-resistant influenza A(H1N1) virus infections during the 2008-2009
season than in children with oseltamivir-susceptible
influenza A(H1N1) virus infections during the 20072008 season, though no significant differences were
observed among the zanamivir-treated children.

Discussion
Oseltamivir is widely used for patients with influenza A
and B infections in clinical settings in Japan. Therefore,
oseltamivir-resistant viruses induced by oseltamivir
treatment emerge in Japan more readily than in other

countries where oseltamivir is not so widely used. It has
been documented that the infectivity and replicative
ability of neuraminidase inhibitor-resistant viruses are
compromised [14,15]; therefore, until recently it was
thought that oseltamivir-resistant influenza A(H1N1)
viruses were unlikely to circulate among humans.
Antigenic and phylogenetic analyses in this study
revealed that two oseltamivir-resistant influenza A
(H1N1) virus strains isolated in the 2007-2008 season
(A/Yamagata/66/2008 and A/Yamagata/68/2008) were
closely related to other oseltamivir-susceptible A(H1N1)
viruses isolated in Yamagata but were different from the
resistant viruses found in Europe. It appears that

oseltamivir-resistant viruses found during the 2007-2008
season in Japan emerged independently among persons
treated with oseltamivir and were isolated in various
communities, as previously described [11,12]. Two oseltamivir-resistant viruses in the present study have HA
and NA genes sequences that are 100% identical
between the two isolates; these viruses were isolated on
February 29 and March 3 from two different children
from the same elementary school who had not been
treated with oseltamivir. In this school, an outbreak of
influenza occurred on February 29, 2008, and 28 (22%)
of 129 students showed influenza-like symptoms
between February 29 and March 17, 2008. Although
only two samples were collected from which oseltamivir-resistant viruses were isolated, there is a possibility
that the transmission of an oseltamivir-resistant virus
had occurred in this school. It was also reported that an
outbreak of an oseltamivir-resistant A(H1N1) virus
occurred in an elementary school in Yokohama City in
Japan during the same season (A/Yokohama/22/2008
and A/Yokohama/35/2008 in the NA gene tree of Figure
3) [12]. Thus, it is likely that oseltamivir-resistant
viruses posses the ability to be transmitted among
humans. However, because the level of oseltamivir resistance remained at 2.5% in Yamagata (2.6% in Japan), it
is apparent that the oseltamivir-resistant viruses did not
spread among humans as easily as the oseltamivir-susceptible viruses.
The oseltamivir-resistant viruses isolated during the
2008-2009 season in Yamagata were antigenically and
phylogenetically different from those isolated during the
2007-2008 season in Yamagata but were phylogenetically
similar to viruses isolated in Europe and North America
during the 2007-2008 season. Thus, it seems that oseltamivir-resistant viruses were imported into Japan, where
they spread across the country during the 2008-2009
season. Some reports have suggested that the emergence
of oseltamivir-resistant viruses in the 2007-2008 season
in Europe was not related to the use of oseltamivir
[16,17], and that natural genetic variations may have
resulted in the change in sensitivity to oseltamivir [18].
It is likely that influenza A(H1N1) viruses having an epidemiological advantage over previous viruses emerged
with natural resistance to oseltamivir and spread
throughout the world. Two representative viruses isolated during the 2008-2009 season in Yamagata (A/
Yamagata/126/2008 and A/Yamagata/128/2008) showed
the same level of growth in MDCK cells as the oseltamivir-susceptible 2007-2008 isolates. The maintenance of
replicative ability and the acquirement of antigenic differences are vital for viruses to continue transmission
among humans. Hereafter, A(H1N1) viruses might continue to circulate with the H275Y mutation in the NA
gene preserved. The pandemic H1N1 viruses emerged in

Page 6 of 8

2009 were oseltamivir-susceptible without H275Y mutation in the NA gene. Cocirculation of oseltamivir-resistant seasonal A(H1N1) viruses and the novel H1N1
pandemic viruses may give rise to the potential risk of
genetic reassortment acquiring the H275Y resistance
mutation in the NA gene.
There have been few reports concerning the clinical
effectiveness of oseltamivir against oseltamivir-resistant
influenza viruses. We found that the duration of fever
after the start of oseltamivir treatment was significantly
longer in children with oseltamivir-resistant influenza A
(H1N1) virus infections than in children with oseltamivir-susceptible A(H1N1) virus infections. This result
suggests that oseltamivir-resistant A(H1N1) viruses circulating during the 2008-2009 season were resistant to
oseltamivir not only in vitro but also in vivo. Zanamivir,
however, reduced the duration of fever in oseltamivirresistant cases. In Japan, zanamivir is used as well as
oseltamivir, especially for the treatment of patients older
than five years. Thus, in cases of oseltamivir-resistant
influenza virus infection, zanamivir would be a more
appropriate treatment than oseltamivir.

Conclusions
Oseltamivir resistance was observed in 2.5% and 100%
of A(H1N1) isolates from Yamagata from the 2007-2008
and 2008-2009 seasons, respectively. Oseltamivir-resistant isolates from Yamagata in the 2007-2008 season
might have acquired resistance through the use of oseltamivir. In contrast, the 2008-2009 oseltamivir-resistant
isolates from Yamagata were similar to viruses isolated
in Europe and North America; therefore, they might
have been introduced into Japan and circulated throughout the country. It is certain that influenza surveillance
to monitor oseltamivir resistance will benefit clinicians
in determining an effective antiviral treatment strategy.
Timely monitoring and reporting of antiviral drug-resistance is important at the global, national, and the local
community levels.
Methods
Specimen collection and virus isolation

Nasopharyngeal swab specimens from patients with
acute respiratory infection were collected at pediatric
clinics collaborating with the local health authorities in
Yamagata Prefecture for the surveillance of viral diseases
in Japan. Specimens were transported to the Yamagata
Prefectural Institute of Public Health and were grown in
a virus culture as previously described [19]. A total of
79 A(H1N1) viruses isolated from 690 specimens
between December 2007 and March 2008 and a total of
77 A(H1N1) viruses isolated from 831 specimens
between December 2008 and March 2009 were used in
this study. Of the 156 isolates, 84 (53.8%) were isolated

Matsuzaki et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:53
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/53

from children under 6 years of age, 55 (35.3%) were
from children aged between 6 and 10 years, 15 (9.6%)
were from children aged between 11 and 15 years, and
2 (1.3%) were from patients >15 years.
NA inhibition assay

A chemiluminescent NA inhibition assay was performed
using a commercially available kit, NA-Star (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA), according to the manufacturerâs protocol. The NA inhibitors (oseltamivir and
zanamivir) susceptibility of influenza virus isolates was
expressed as the concentration of NA inhibitor needed
to inhibit the NA enzyme activity by 50% (IC50). Oseltamivir carboxylate, the active form of the prodrug oseltamivir phosphate, was provided by F. Hoffmann-La
Roche Ltd, Switzerland, and zanamivir was provided by
GlaxoSmithKline Research and Development Ltd., United Kingdom.
Hemagglutination inhibition test

The hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test was performed in microtiter plates with 1% guinea pig erythrocytes and post-infection ferret antisera against A/
Solomon Islands/3/2006 [2007-2008 A(H1N1) vaccine
strain] and A/Brisbane/59/2007 [2008-2009 A(H1N1)
vaccine strain] (Denka Seiken Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan),
as described previously [20]. Sera were treated with
receptor-destroying enzyme before use. For the vaccine
antigen, purified HA protein (Denka Seiken Co., Ltd)
was diluted in a hemagglutination titer of eight, while
MDCK culture fluid was also diluted in hemagglutination titer of eight and used as the isolate antigen.
Growth of H1N1 isolates in culture

MDCK cells were infected with an A (H1N1) isolate at
an MOI of 0.001 and incubated for 72 hours at 37Â°C in
the presence of 2 Î¼g/ml trypsin. At 12 h, 24 h, 48 h,
and 72 h post-infection, the supernatants were harvested
and virus titers were determined by a plaque assay on
MDCK cells. The growth test was performed in duplicate experiments, and the mean virus titer was
calculated.
Sequence analyses

The extraction of viral RNA and cDNA synthesis using
random primers were performed as described previously
[21,22]. The cDNA was then used as the template for the
amplification of the HA and NA genes by PCR. The HA
gene was amplified using primers 5â-AGCAAAAGCAGGGGAAAATAA-3â and 5â-AACCATCTACCATTCCAGTC-3â, and the NA gene was amplified using primers
5â-AGCAAAAGCAGGAGTTTAAAATGA-3â and 5âGTAGAAACAAGGAGTTTTTTCAAC-3â. The PCR products were purified with a QIAquick PCR purification kit

(QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and then sequenced using a
Big Dye Terminator V1.1 cycle sequencing kit (Applied
Biosystems) on an Applied Biosystems 3130 automatic
sequencer. The nucleotide sequences determined in this
study were assigned the accession numbers as follows at
GenBank: AB521053-AB521112 and AB539701AB539710. Published A(H1N1) virus sequences were
obtained from GenBank (Accession numbers AB465320,
AB465322, CY030230, CY030233, CY033622, CY033624,
EU124136, EU124137, EU516057, EU516085, EU516083,
EU516116, EU516118, EU516200, EU516257, EU516148,
EU551811, EU551832, EU914903, EU914910, FJ403550,
FJ445031, FJ445089, FJ654304). The sequence data were
analyzed with the CLUSTAL W version 1.83 software, and
a phylogenetic tree was constructed via the neighbor-joining method using the same software.
Clinical information

We used the clinical information of children who visited
the Sanjoh Clinic and from whom A(H1N1) influenza
virus was isolated. Data were obtained retrospectively
from their medical records. To compare the data between
oseltamivir-resistant and oseltamivir-susceptible A(H1N1)
virus infections, we used the Mann-Whitney U test. A P
value of < 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant.
