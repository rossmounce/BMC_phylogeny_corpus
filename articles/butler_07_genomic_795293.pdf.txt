Abstract
Background: Groundwater and subsurface environments contaminated with aromatic compounds can be
remediated in situ by Geobacter species that couple oxidation of these compounds to reduction of Fe(III)-oxides.
Geobacter metallireducens metabolizes many aromatic compounds, but the enzymes involved are not well known.
Results: The complete G. metallireducens genome contained a 300 kb island predicted to encode enzymes for the
degradation of phenol, p-cresol, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, 4-hydroxybenzoate, benzyl alcohol, benzaldehyde, and
benzoate. Toluene degradation genes were encoded in a separate region. None of these genes was found in
closely related species that cannot degrade aromatic compounds. Abundant transposons and phage-like genes in
the island suggest mobility, but nucleotide composition and lack of synteny with other species do not suggest a
recent transfer. The inferred degradation pathways are similar to those in species that anaerobically oxidize
aromatic compounds with nitrate as an electron acceptor. In these pathways the aromatic compounds are
converted to benzoyl-CoA and then to 3-hydroxypimelyl-CoA. However, in G. metallireducens there were no
genes for the energetically-expensive dearomatizing enzyme. Whole-genome changes in transcript levels were
identified in cells oxidizing benzoate. These supported the predicted pathway, identified induced fatty-acid
oxidation genes, and identified an apparent shift in the TCA cycle to a putative ATP-yielding succinyl-CoA
synthase. Paralogs to several genes in the pathway were also induced, as were several putative molybdo-proteins.
Comparison of the aromatics degradation pathway genes to the genome of an isolate from a contaminated field
site showed very similar content, and suggested this strain degrades many of the same compounds. This strain
also lacked a classical dearomatizing enzyme, but contained two copies of an eight-gene cluster encoding redox
proteins that was 30-fold induced during benzoate oxidation.
Conclusion: G. metallireducens appears to convert aromatic compounds to benzoyl-CoA, then to acetyl-CoA via
fatty acid oxidation, and then to carbon dioxide via the TCA cycle. The enzyme responsible for dearomatizing the
aromatic ring may be novel, and energetic investments at this step may be offset by a change in succinate
metabolism. Analysis of a field isolate suggests that the pathways inferred for G. metallireducens may be applicable
to modeling in situ bioremediation.

Background
Some bacteria can metabolize the toxic aromatic compounds that are present in groundwater contaminated by
petroleum or by landfill leachate [1-4]. The bacteria use
these contaminants as the carbon and energy sources for
growth, and they can oxidize many aromatic compounds
completely to carbon dioxide. Both the species that
accomplish this bioremediation and the mechanism with
which they degrade these stable compounds are being
investigated.
The benzene-ring structure of aromatic compounds must
be dearomatized before they can be fully degraded. While
oxygen can be used to attack the ring, many contaminated
environments are anaerobic, so a different mechanism is
needed [5]. The best-studied anaerobic species that catalyze this reaction couple the oxidation of aromatics to the
reduction of high potential compounds like nitrate
[4,6,7]. This metabolism provides enough energy to allow
the dearomatization of the benzene-ring by an enzyme
that uses two ATP and two low potential electrons instead
of oxygen [8-10].
However, insoluble Fe(III)-oxides are the primary electron acceptor in many contaminated environments [1114], and the energy gained from reducing Fe(III)-oxides
(ΔE°' ≅ 200 mV) is less than that from nitrate (ΔE°' = 420
mV). It has been suggested that bacteria that use lower
potential electron acceptors like Fe(III) or sulfate, or bacteria that ferment aromatic compounds, require a less
energetically expensive mechanism to dearomatize the
aromatic ring [15-17]. These enzymes have not yet been
identified.
Molecular analyses have shown that members of the Geobacter family are the most abundant species in contaminated environments where Fe(III) is the electron acceptor
[14,18,19]. Geobacter metallireducens was the first pure-culture organism found to anaerobically oxidize an aromatic
hydrocarbon, toluene [12]. This species is also able to
completely oxidize the aromatic compounds phenol, pcresol, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, 4-hydroxybenzoate, benzyl alcohol, benzaldehyde, and benzoate, all with Fe(III)
serving as the sole electron acceptor [20,21].
Two recent studies sought to identify enzymes involved in
benzoate oxidation in G. metallireducens, specifically the
enzyme that catalyzes the dearomatization of the benzene-ring [22,23]. Comparison of protein abundance in
G. metallireducens growing by benzoate versus acetate oxidation identified 14 proteins that were more abundant
during benzoate metabolism [23]. The genes encoding
these proteins were located on two contigs in the partially
completed G. metallireducens genome, and an additional
19 nearby genes were shown to have increased transcript

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/180

levels in the presence of benzoate compared to acetate
[23]. Several of the induced genes and proteins had clear
sequence homology to those that catalyze benzoate
metabolism in the nitrate-reducer Thauera aromatica, with
one exception. No proteins similar to known benzoylCoA reductases, the enzyme that catalyzes the ring reduction, were found to have increased expression during benzoate oxidation, and no benzoyl-CoA reductase activity
was detected in cell extracts [23].
A separate study suggests that genes for a benzoyl-CoA
reductase were present elsewhere in the G. metallireducens
genome [22]. Degenerate primers were designed from
known benzoyl-CoA reductase α subunits, and used to
amplified sequence from G. metallireducens genomic DNA
[22]. Analysis of the corresponding gene and its flanking
region led to the conclusion that the gene was the α subunit of the benzoyl-CoA reductase. The same analysis was
done with a Geobacter species that cannot degrade aromatic compounds, and no such gene could be amplified
[22].
The aim of this study is to use the completed genome
sequence of G. metallireducens to predict the pathways for
degradation of toluene, phenol, p-cresol, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, 4-hydroxybenzoate, benzyl alcohol, benzaldehyde, and benzoate. Support for the predicted pathways is
provided by analysis of genome-wide changes in transcript levels by DNA microarray in cells oxidizing benzoate. The relevance of the G. metallireducens pathways to
in situ environmental bioremediation is examined by
comparison to a recently sequenced Geobacter isolate from
a contaminated site.

Results and discussion
The 300 kb island of aromatics-degradation genes
The two gene clusters previously identified as encoding
proteins and genes with increased expression during benzoate oxidation [23] were encoded ca. 60 kb apart in the
completed genome (see Additional file 1) (accession
NC_007517) [24]. These clusters were part of a 300 kb,
244-gene region (Gmet_2037-Gmet_2284) in which very
few of the encoded proteins had orthologs in the genome
of G. sulfurreducens, a closely related Geobacter species that
cannot metabolize aromatic compounds (see Additional
file 1). Orthologs were defined as proteins that were reciprocal best matches when all proteins from both genomes
were aligned, with a minimum alignment of 60% of both
proteins. Across the whole G. metallireducens genome,
2130 proteins (60.3%) had orthologs in G. sulfurreducens,
but in this region of the genome only 20 (8%) had
orthologs in the G. sulfurreducens genome (see Additional
file 1).

When the 244 proteins encoded in this region were
aligned against the entire non-redundant protein database from NCBI, many had highest sequence similarity to
enzymes involved in aromatics degradation in the nitratereducing organisms Thauera aromatica and Azoarcus sp.
EbN1 (see Additional file 1). However, the overall organization of the genes in the island was not found to be conserved when compared to any other organism. Analysis of
the composition and structure of this region is discussed
below.

During phenol metabolism in T. aromatica, a two-subunit

In G. metallireducens, homologs to these genes were found
in the aromatics region, in a putative operon
(Gmet_2100-Gmet_2102) (Figure 1, Additional file 1).

In previously studied bacteria, p-cresol is metabolized by
conversion to 4-hydroxybenzoate via 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde. A flavocytochrome p-cresol methylhydroxylase creates 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, which is then oxidized via a
4-hydroxybenzaldehyde dehydrogenase [28,29]. In G.
metallireducens, homologs to the two-subunit methylhydroxylase (Gmet_2125-Gmet_2126) are encoded just
upstream of the putative dehydrogenase (Gmet_2131), all
within the aromatics island of the genome (Figure 1,
Additional file 1). These genes have high sequence similarity to those in Azoarcus-related species and Pseudomonas
putida [28,29].
In T. aromatica, 4-hydroxybenzoate, benzyl alcohol, and
benzaldehyde are all metabolized to the central intermediate benzoyl-CoA. 4-hydroxybenzoate is converted via a
Co-A ligase and a well-studied reductase [30]. In G. metallireducens, a three-gene cluster in the aromatics island of
the genome (Gmet_2134-Gmet_2136) had identical
organization and high sequence similarity to the 4hydroxybenzoyl-CoA reductase operon in T. aromatica
(Figure 1, Additional file 1). In G. metallireducens, the
dehydrogenase genes predicted to be responsible for the
conversion of benzyl alcohol and benzaldehyde to benzoate (Gmet_2235 and Gmet_2131) have closest
homologs to those enzymes in Azoarcus-related species
and Pseudomonas species (Figure 1, Additional file 1)
[29,31]. The specificity of the CoA ligases for 4-hydroxybenzoate and benzoate is difficult to predict based on
sequence identity alone. However, the benzoate CoA
ligase (BclA) was previously identified and characterized
[23], and in the completed genome is encoded by
Gmet_2143 (Figure 1, Additional file 1).

The putative benzoyl-CoA reductase
The pathways that can be inferred from the analysis presented above predict that, like nitrate-reducing species, all
of the aromatic compounds that G. metallireducens is capable of degrading are converted to the central metabolite
benzoyl-CoA (Figure 1). However, benzoyl-CoA is still
aromatic, and dearomatization of the benzene-ring structure is the central step in the degradation pathways. The
enzyme that catalyzes this reaction in nitrate-reducing
species, the benzoyl-CoA reductase, has been well studied
[5,9]. Previously, a gene predicted to encode this enzyme
in G. metallireducens was identified (NCBI accession
YP_383512) [22], and in the completed genome, this

gene was encoded by Gmet_0544. This gene was not
located in the aromatics island of the genome.
Examination of this gene, its closest phylogenetic relatives, and the adjacent genes indicate that this gene does
not appear to be part of a classical benzoyl-CoA reductase.
Gmet_0544 had highest amino acid identity to the ATPbinding activator subunit of 2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA dehydratases, an enzyme involved in the fermentation of glutamate via the hydroxyglutarate pathway [32]. Gmet_0544
was more similar to the characterized activator subunits
from Clostridia symbiosum [33] and Acidaminococcus fermentans [34] (ca. 30%), than to the benzoyl-CoA reductase proteins from T. aromatica, Azoarcus species, or R.
palustris (ca. 17%).
A phylogenetic tree was constructed for Gmet_0544 and
the activator subunits of known benzoyl-CoA reductases
and 2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA dehydratases (Figure 2). The
benzoyl-CoA reductases clustered in two groups, the
Thauera-species group and the Azoarcus-species group, as
has been previously described (Figure 2) [7]. As expected,
characterized 2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA dehydratases subunits from Clostridia species also formed a distinct clade
(Figure 2). The protein encoded by Gmet_0544 clustered
with homologous proteins from two other Geobacteraceae
species that do not oxidize aromatic compounds, and
with a variety of uncharacterized proteins from Clostridia
and other species (Figure 2).

More importantly, Gmet_0544 is not a likely part of either
a functional 2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA dehydratase or a
functional benzoyl-CoA reductase, because there were no
genes in the genome that were predicted to encode the catalytic subunits of these enzymes. Sequences of the four
subunit benzoyl-CoA reductases and of the three subunit
2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA dehydratases were compared with
all proteins in the completed G. metallireducens genome
(Figure 3). There was no cluster, either inside the aromatics island or elsewhere, that resembled these enzymes. The
two ATP-binding subunits of these enzymes both had
some similarity to Gmet_0544 (Figure 3, Table 1). However, the catalytic subunits had no significant matches in
the G. metallireducens genome (Figure 3, Table 1).
Metabolism of the non-aromatic products
In other anaerobic aromatics degraders the reduction of
benzoyl-CoA produces cyclohexa-1,5-diene-1-carbonylCoA, which is then converted to 3-hydroxypimelyl-CoA
[35]. In G. metallireducens, homologs to the proteins that
catalyze this conversion are expressed during benzoate
oxidation [23]. These genes, the cyclohexa-1,5-diene-1carbonyl-CoA hydratase (dch, Gmet_2150), 6-hydroxycylohex-1-en-1-carbonyl-CoA
dehydrogenase
(had,
Gmet_2151), and 6-oxocyclohex-1-ene-1-carbonyl-CoA
hydratase (oah, Gmet_2088), are all located in the aromatics region of the genome (Table 1).

The 3-hydroxypimelyl-CoA that results from this pathway
enters into the beta fatty acid oxidation pathway, where it
is converted to acetyl-CoA [7]. In G. metallireducens, there

are several clusters in the aromatics island that encode
genes predicted to be involved in fatty acid oxidation,
including
Gmet_2057-Gmet_2075,
Gmet_2194Gmet_2213, and Gmet_2268-Gmet_2270. Putative acylCoA dehydrogenases, enoyl-CoA hydratases, thiolases,
and Co-A transferases were all present in multiple copies
with high sequence similarities (see Additional file 1).
However, unlike the other genes predicted to be involved
in aromatics degradation in G. metallireducens, the closest
homologs in the NCBI database are not from known aromatics degraders. Closest homologs to these genes were
found in a variety of species including Clostridia, gamma
Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria (see Additional file 1).
Thus, while G. metallireducens lacks the central enzyme of
the pathway, the ATP-dependent benzoyl-CoA reductase,
it contains genes for the oxidation of the product of benzoyl-CoA reduction, including dch, had, oah, and fatty acid
pathway genes (Figure 1).
Paralogs of the enzymes BamB, BamC, and Oah
It has been suggested that an uncharacterized protein
called BamB (Gmet_2087) could be a possible alternative
to the benzoyl-CoA reductase, because it was shown to be
more abundant in benzoate-grown cells of G. metallireducens than cells grown on acetate [23]. Analysis of the completed genome showed that there was a second protein
with homology to BamB encoded outside of the aromatics
island of the genome. Gmet_1802 encoded a protein of
identical length to Gmet_2087, with 66% amino acid
identity. This gene was encoded in a small region that
lacked orthologs in G. sulfurreducens (Gmet_1784Gmet_1815). This cluster also contained a close homolog
to the putative Fe-S protein that is encoded upstream of

bamB, called BamC. BamC and its paralogs (Gmet_1803)
have 64% amino acid identity to each other.
The function of BamB and its paralog cannot be readily
deduced from their sequence. Of characterized proteins,
they are most similar (ca. 25% amino acid identity) to formaldehyde and aldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductases
from Archaea species [36,37]. However, alignment of
BamB and its homolog to these enzymes from Pyrococcus
furiosus showed that, while the overall alignment is good,
several important residues are not conserved. The residues
that line the substrate pockets, the residues closest to the
tungsten, and the residues that interact with the tungstopterin are not conserved. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed
that the G. metallireducens proteins were clearly distinct
from the clades of formaldehyde, aldehyde, and glyceraldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductases (Figure 4). None of
the characterized tungsto-enzymes grouped with the G.
metallireducens enzymes, but homologs were found in S.
aciditrophicus, a benzoate fermenter (Figure 4) [38].
A second enzyme predicted to be involved in the central
part of the pathway of benzoate oxidation in G. metallireducens was also found to have a homologous gene outside
of the aromatics region of the genome. Gmet_3305, with
86% amino acid identity to Oah (Gmet_2088) in the aromatics island, was found distant in the genome in a 30gene region that lacked orthologs in G. sulfurreducens
(Gmet_3280-Gmet_3309).
The organization and duplication of these central genes in
the benzoyl-CoA pathway are unique to G. metallireducens. In T. aromatica, Azoarcus species, R. palustris, and
Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum, the central genes in the
pathway (the benzoyl-CoA reductase, Dch, Had, and
Oah) are always encoded in a large cluster [7,39,40]. G.
metallireducens lacks the reductase, and the roles of BamB
and its newly identified homolog cannot be predicted
based on sequence analysis alone. The dch and had genes
are adjacent, but neither is near either of the two very similar oah homologs.
The toluene degradation genes
In addition to the aromatics compounds described above,
G. metallireducens can also degrade the hydrocarbon toluene [12]. The genes in G. metallireducens are similar to
those for conversion of toluene to benzoyl-CoA in other
organisms, and have been described previously (Figure 1)
[41]. There are two apparent operons encoded next to
each other, for the benzylsuccinate synthase (bssCAB,
Gmet_1538-Gmet_1540) and for benzylsuccinate oxidation to benzyl-CoA (bbsABCD, Gmet_1528-1531, and
bbsEFGH, Gmet_1521-Gmet_1524). In the completed
genome, these genes were not located near the other aromatics degradation genes. Instead, they were encoded 556

Gmet_1435-Gmet_1572, only 25 of 133 genes (19%) had
orthologs in the G. sulfurreducens genome.
Characterization of the large genomic island
Genes for aromatics degradation have been found as parts
of catabolic transposons [42]. In an effort to understand
the origin of the aromatics degradation genes in G. metallireducens, analysis of local compositional heterogeneity
and identification of potential mobile genetic elements
were performed [43,44].

The genome average for GC content was 59.5%. The start
of the large aromatic island was defined by a region of significantly atypical composition. The 5' end (near base

2,280,000) had low GC content and GC skew, and an
atypical dinucleotide relative abundance (Figure 5, Figure
6). This point was also the beginning of the region that
had very low ortholog frequency compared to the G. sulfurreducens genome (see Additional file 1). There was
another small region of low GC content that separated oah
and the bam cluster of genes from the other genes predicted to be involved in aromatics metabolism (Figure 5,
Figure 6). However, neither the bam cluster nor any of the
genes predicted to be involved in aromatics metabolism
(Figure 1) had significant deviance in composition compared to the rest of the genome (Figure 5, Additional file
1). The last third of large island had atypically low GC
content and atypical dinucleotide relative abundance
(Figure 5, Figure 6, Additional file 1). The 3' end of the
island was defined as the point near base 2,590,000 that

places in the genome: upstream of the bamB homolog
(Gmet_1788-Gmet_1789), and upstream of the oah
homolog (Gmet_3281-Gmet_3282).

Transposons and repetitive sequences
There were 9 transposase insertion sequence elements
flanked with perfect inverted repeats (IS) in the large aromatics island (Figure 5). At the 3' end of the large aromatics island was a putative two gene transposase operon,
Gmet_2272-Gmet_2273, of the istAB-type [45]. Exact copies of this pair, with 100% nucleic acid identity including
the flanking inverted repeats, were found in two other

The eight other IS elements in the large aromatics island
were Gmet_2039, Gmet_2073, Gmet_2091, Gmet_2093,
Gmet_2160, Gmet_2166, Gmet_2240, and Gmet_2284
(Figure 5). Based on sequence similarity, these transposons belong to a variety of families, including IS4, IS5,
ISl3, IS21, and IS110 [45,46]. Two pairs of these IS elements had 100% nucleic acid identity to each other
(Gmet_2091 to Gmet_2240 and Gmet_2166 to

Gmet_2284). These identical pairs could form a larger,
composite transposon that would include all the intervening genes (Figure 5).
There was a 131 bp direct repeat in the aromatics island,
with the left copy at the 5' end of the island between
Gmet_2036 and Gmet_2037 (coordinates 2280680–
2280810), and the right copy between Gmet_2166 and
Gmet_2168 (Figure 5). There was also a 130 bp inverted
repeat, with the left copy between Gmet_2092 and
Gmet_2093 (coordinates 2280680–2280810), and the
right copy within Gmet_2271 (Figure 5).
Phage-like genes
All four regions of aromatics metabolism genes were
flanked on at least one side by tRNA genes. tRNA genes are
often associated with genomic islands [47], and are often
target sites for phage attachment and integration [48]. The
3' end of the large aromatics island was flanked by a tRNAGly gene, and a pseudo tRNA was found 6.6 kb upstream

Thus, the 300 kb region that contains the predicted aromatics degradation genes shows many of the hallmarks of
genomic islands [47]. The genes in these regions are species-specific; they have no orthologs in the closely related
species, G. sulfurreducens, which cannot degrade aromatics. The genes are encoded in large, discrete units, flanked
by genes with atypical nucleotide composition, tRNA
genes, and phage-like integrases. The region shows signs
of potential genetic mobility, including identical transposons and repetitive sequences. However, the genes predicted to be involved in aromatics metabolism do not
have atypical composition compared to the rest of the
genome, and they lack synteny with the genes from other
aromatics degraders. This implies that if there were horizontal gene transfer event(s) from distantly related organisms, the genes have since ameliorated [43,49].
Gene expression changes during benzoate metabolism
In order to further evaluate the genes predicted to be
involved in the degradation of aromatic compounds,
changes in levels of gene transcripts were compared for
3417 ORFs (97% of the genome) with microarray analysis
(NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus, accession GSE5401).
Cells were grown in continuous-culture chemostats with
either benzoate or acetate as the limiting electron donor
and with Fe(III) as the electron acceptor. A total of 121
genes (3.4% of the genome) had transcript levels that
were at least 2-fold higher during growth with benzoate
(see Additional file 2). Analysis of the distribution of
these genes across the genome showed that the majority
(64) were encoded in the 300 kb aromatics island (Figure
7). 36 genes (1.0% of the genome) had at least 10-fold
higher transcript levels during benzoate oxidation (Table
2). Most of these genes (28) were in the aromatics island
of the genome. A total of 21 genes (0.6 % of the genome)
had at least 2-fold decreased expression levels during benzoate oxidation, with a maximum decrease of 4.6 fold (see
Additional file 2). None of these down-regulated genes
were located in the aromatics island of the genome (Figure 7).
The Thauera-like benzoate pathway
Previously, 14 proteins were identified as having
increased expression during benzoate oxidation in G. met-

dation (see Additional file 2). In addition, microarray
analysis also identified increases in transcript levels in several other genes in these two clusters that were not previously identified (see Additional file 2). Like the 13 genes
identified by protein analysis, most of these genes were
also at least 10-fold more abundant in benzoate oxidizing
cells (Table 2). Transcripts for the benzoate-CoA ligase
(Gmet_2143) had a smaller increase in abundance, 4.9
fold, than the other genes predicted to be involved in the
benzoate oxidation pathway, (Figure 1, Additional file 2).
Thus, microarray analysis of transcript abundance
changes during benzoate oxidation reliably identified the
genes predicted to be involved in benzoate oxidation (Figure 1).

The thick black bar represents the large aromatics island
Gmet_2037-Gmet_2284.

Gmet_0544
Unlike the other genes in the predicted benzoyl-CoA
pathway, the gene previously identified as the α subunit
of the benzoyl-CoA reductase (Gmet_0544) [22] had no
change in abundance during benzoate oxidation (see
Additional file 2). Neither did any of the neighboring
genes (see Additional file 2). This result supports the analysis presented earlier that shows that this gene is not likely
to be part of the pathway of aromatics degradation, and is
not the benzoyl-CoA reductase.

The dch and had genes (Gmet_2150, Gmet_2151) were
among the most strongly induced of all genes, with about
30-fold increase during benzoate oxidation (Figure 1,
Table 2). Because the array was designed based on a draft
version of the genome, a probe was created for only one
of the two oah homologs, Gmet_3305. Like dch and had,
this gene was found to be among the most strongly
induced genes during benzoate oxidation, with a 27 fold
change in transcript levels (Figure 1, Table 2). The other
homolog to oah, Gmet_2088, has previously been shown
to have increased expression during benzoate oxidation
[23]. Thus, it appears that both oah homologs have
increased expression during benzoate oxidation.

bamB and bamC homologs
Analysis of whole genome transcript changes during
growth with benzoate showed that bamB had the second
highest increase, 36.4-fold, of all genes (Table 2). In addition, the cluster of seven genes (Gmet_2080-Gmet_2087)
that bamB was a part of was the most highly up-regulated
cluster in the genome, ca. 25-fold (Figure 7, Table 2). As
described above, a homolog to bamB was found outside
the aromatics island of the genome. This homolog,
Gmet_1802, also had a large increase in transcript levels,
23.6-fold, during growth on benzoate (Table 2). The cluster that contained bamB2 (Gmet_1795-Gmet_1810) was
the only large gene cluster outside of the aromatics region
that had a significant increase in transcript levels during
growth on benzoate (see Additional file 2). Directly
upstream of both bamB homologs were the homologous
genes, bamC and bamC2, both encoding putative 4Fe-4S
cluster proteins (Gmet_2086 and Gmet_1803). These
genes were also induced more than 15-fold in the presence of benzoate (Table 2). Thus, like the two oah
homologs, the two bamB and bamC homologs both have
large increases in expression during growth by benzoate
oxidation.

The induced proteins [23] were encoded in two small
clusters inside the aromatics island, and an additional 19
genes within these clusters have been shown by RT-PCR to
be induced by benzoate oxidation [23]. Microarray analysis identified 14 of these as induced during benzoate oxi-

Fatty acid oxidation
The completed genome of G. metallireducens contained
several copies of genes predicted to be involved in fatty
acid oxidation. Only one set, Gmet_2057-Gmet_2075,
had marked increases in abundance during benzoate oxi-

allireducens [23]. The microarray analysis identified
increased transcript abundance in 13 of the genes that
encode these proteins (see Additional file 2). 10 of these
were among the very few ORFs in the genome that showed
an increase of at least 10-fold during benzoate oxidation
(Table 2).

dation (see Additional file 2). This set included the gene
with the greatest increase in transcript levels during
growth on benzoate, a 50-fold induced thiolase
(Gmet_2074) (Table 2). Also induced more than 15-fold
were another thiolase (Gmet_2058), two acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (Gmet_2072, Gmet_2075), and two enoylCoA hydratases (Gmet_2057, Gmet_2071) (Table 2).
Thus, though there are several homologs to beta fatty acid
oxidation genes in the genome, only one cluster showed
increases in expression during benzoate oxidation (Figure
5).
Changes in the TCA cycle
The oxidation of one benzoate molecule via the benzoylCoA and fatty acid pathways results in three molecules of
acetyl-CoA [7]. Acetate, another electron donor used by
Geobacter species, is also converted to acetyl-CoA. In G.

sulfurreducens, acetyl-CoA is oxidized to carbon dioxide
via TCA cycle reactions, and in G. metallireducens most of
the TCA cycle enzymatic activities have also been identified [50,51].
During growth with acetate as the electron donor, the TCA
cycle of G. sulfurreducens does not include an ATP-yielding
succinyl-CoA synthetase [51]. In other organisms, this
enzyme catalyzes the conversion of succinyl-CoA to succinate and produces the only substrate-level phosphorylation of the TCA cycle. Instead, in Geobacter species, an
acetate:succinyl-CoA transferase is used to convert succinyl-CoA to succinate coupled to the activation of acetate
to acetyl-CoA [51]. Thus, there is no substrate-level ATP
generation during acetyl-CoA oxidation.

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:180

However, analysis of the genome of G. metallireducens
showed that there were three sets of genes predicted to
encode the two-subunit ATP-yielding succinyl-CoA synthetase enzyme: Gmet_0729-Gmet_0730, Gmet_2068Gmet_2069, and Gmet_2260-Gmet_2261. The latter two
pairs were found in the aromatics island of the genome
and shared 92% sequence identity (Supplementary Table
1). The third set of genes, Gmet_0729-Gmet_0730, was
only ca. 55% identical to the pairs inside the aromatics
island. At least one of the subunits of each of these pairs
was shown to have increased transcript abundance during
benzoate oxidation, with increases of 8 to 32 fold (see
Additional file 2).
The ortholog in G. metallireducens to the acetate:succinylCoA transferase of G. sulfurreducens was encoded by
Gmet_3044. This gene was one of the relatively few genes
that had decreased abundance during benzoate oxidation,
with a 2.2 fold decrease (see Additional file 2). When considered together, these two results – the decrease in the
transferase gene and the increase in the synthetase genes –
suggest that the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of
succinyl-CoA to succinate is changed when benzoate is
the electron donor. Since the product of benzoate oxidation is likely acetyl-CoA and not acetate, there would be
no need for an acetate:succinyl-CoA transferase. The
exclusive use of a succinyl-CoA synthetase instead would
allow for the generation of an ATP by substrate level phosphorylation for each of the three acetyl-CoA molecules
predicted to be produced from benzoate oxidation.
Molyboenzymes
Molybdenum has been shown to be required for benzoate
oxidation in the sulfate-reducer D. multivorans, but is not
required for nitrate-reducers [16]. A recent study showed
only a slight decrease in growth in G. metallireducens cultured without molybdenum supplementation, but these
results were qualified due to molybdenum impurities in
the growth media [23].

Several putative molybo-proteins had higher transcript
levels during growth on benzoate in G. metallireducens
(see Additional file 2). As described above, both of the
BamB homologs (Gmet_2087 and Gmet_1802) are
related to tungsto- and molybo-proteins, and both had ca.
30-fold induction during benzoate oxidation. Nearby
bamB2 were genes for a putative molybdenum cofactor
biosynthesis protein (Gmet_1804) with 4.5-fold higher
transcript level during growth on benzoate, and for a putative molybdopterin oxidoreductase, Gmet_1810, with
2.0-fold induction (see Additional file 2). Though no 4hydroxybenzoate was supplied to the cultures, the genes
for the molybdo-enzyme 4-hydroxybenzoate reductase
(Gmet_2134-Gmet_2136) had ca. 2.5-fold transcript levels during growth on benzoate (see Additional file 2). In

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/180

addition, a putative nitrate reductase operon, also a
molybdo-enzyme (Gmet_0329-Gmet_0334) had ca. 3fold higher transcript levels during growth on benzoate,
though no nitrate was supplied (see Additional file 2).
Down-regulated genes
As mentioned above, the enzyme predicted to be required
for acetate activation, an acetate-CoA transferase was
down-regulated 2.2 fold in the absence of acetate (see
Additional file 2). Two apparent operons were also downregulated: Gmet_1380-Gmet_1381, encoding proteins
similar to those involved in disulfide bond formation,
and Gmet_1753-Gmet_1756, encoding proteins similar
to the glutamate synthases found in methanogens (see
Additional file 2). Two putative transcriptional regulators
were down-regulated, one of which shows similarity to
the IclR family of regulators involved in acetate metabolism in Escherichia coli [52]. Also down-regulated were
eight hypothetical or conserved hypothetical proteins (see
Additional file 2).
Genes in a Geobacter species from an aromaticscontaminated field site
A strain of Geobacter was recently isolated from sediments
from the Department of Energy's Field Research Center in
Oak Ridge, Tennessee (Geobacter strain FRC-32, Joel
Kostka, personal communication). This site is contaminated with uranium, metals, and fuel hydrocarbons
including toluene, and bioremediation by in situ bacteria
is being studied there. Geobacter species have been shown
to be present in sediments from the site [53,54], and the
Geobacter population has been shown to increase by two
orders of magnitude during stimulation of Fe(III) and uranium reduction [54]. The draft sequence of the Geobacter
strain FRC-32 genome has recently been released (NCBI
Accession number AASH00000000). The sequence of the
16S rRNA gene of Geobacter strain FRC-32 is 99.4 – 99.8 %
identical to the Geobacter 16S rRNA gene sequences
cloned from the contaminated site [54]. The genome is
4.0 Mb, with 3396 open reading frames in 164 contigs,
each with sequence coverage of at least 10×.

To evaluate the possibility of extrapolating the predicted
pathways of aromatics degradation in G. metallireducens to
an environment of bioremediation, the genes from G.
metallireducens were compared to those encoded in the
Geobacter strain FRC-32 genome. Geobacter strain FRC-32
encoded proteins with high sequence similarity and
orthology to those in G. metallireducens for the oxidation
of toluene, phenol, p-cresol, 4-hydroxybenzoate, and benzoate (Figure 1, Additional file 1). As with G. metallireducens, these compounds are predicted to be funneled to the
central intermediate of benzoyl-CoA. In Geobacter strain
FRC-32, there were also very similar orthologs to Dch,
Had, Oah, and the fatty acid proteins that had higher tran-

script levels during benzoate oxidation in G. metallireducens, indicating that the dearomatized intermediate could
also be oxidized to 3-hydroxypimelyl-CoA then acetylCoA (Figure 1, Additional file 1).
Like G. metallireducens, there were no proteins similar to
known benzoyl-CoA reductases encoded in the Geobacter
strain FRC-32 genome. However, the bamB-bamI cluster,
which was the most highly induced cluster of genes in the
G. metallireducens genome during benzoate oxidation, and
which was previously suggested as a candidate dearomatization enzyme, was duplicated in Geobacter strain FRC-32.
Like G. metallireducens, Geobacter strain FRC-32 contains a
cluster that encodes an Oah homolog, BamB, and the
BamC-BamI genes (Figure 8). However, in Geobacter strain
FRC-32, eight genes downstream of this cluster are two
bamB homologs and a second, identically organized
bamC-bamI cluster (Figure 8).

Conclusion
The pathways of aromatics degradation in the Fe(III)reducing, obligate anaerobe G. metallireducens appear to
be similar to those from nitrate-reducing organisms that
use more favorable electron acceptors. The genes are more
closely related to those that have been studied in the
nitrate-reducing beta Proteobacteria than to the nitratereducing or photosynthetic alpha Proteobacteria species.
Toluene, phenol, p-cresol, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, 4hydroxybenzoate, benzyl alcohol, benzaldehyde, and
benzoate are all predicted to be channeled to the central
intermediate benzoyl-CoA. De-aromatized products are
predicted to be oxidized to 3-hydroxypimelyl-CoA.
However, there is one notable exception to this similarity.
The reaction which has been shown to be the most energetically expensive in nitrate-reducing organisms, and

which has been hypothesized to be different in obligate
anaerobes, must be different in G. metallireducens. The
completion of the genome sequence proves that G. metallireducens encodes no classical benzoyl-CoA reductase, the
ATP-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the breaking of the
aromatic bonds in benzoyl-CoA. Phylogenetic analysis,
subunit content, and expression studies contradict the
previous report that a benzoyl-CoA reductase was present
in G. metallireducens, and support the previous report that
no benzoyl-CoA reductase activity was found in G. metallireducens metabolizing benzoate.
The enzyme that dearomatizes benzoyl-CoA in G. metallireducens remains unknown. The 30-fold increase in transcript levels of the bamB-bamI cluster, and its phylogenetic
relationship to genes in a benzoate-fermenter and in a
field-isolate, support a role for these genes in benzoate
oxidation. However, the lack of sequence similarity of
these genes to characterized enzymes, and the discovery of
highly induced paralogs in the genome indicate that further analysis of both sets of genes is necessary. Regardless
of the mechanism, the dearomatization of benzoyl-CoA
remains the most difficult step of the pathway, and G. metallireducens may offset energetic costs of this step by
changing the way the acetyl-CoA produced by the pathway is oxidized.
The aromatics genes are organized in G. metallireducens in
an island that shows substantial evidence of potential
genetic mobility, and they are not found in closely related
Geobacteraceae species that do not oxidize aromatic compounds. However, no evidence that these aromatics genes
were recently transferred into the genome was found. The
enzymes in the pathway up to the last step before fatty
acid oxidation appear to be most similar to Thauera-like
species, but the genes for fatty acid and TCA cycle oxida-

tion, and the bamB-bamI cluster genes, though nearby, are
more closely related to other organisms. Perhaps the
genes were assembled in G. metallireducens from existing
functional units into a new combination, as has been suggested for other catabolic pathways [55,56]. The continued effort to sequence other environmentally relevant
Geobacteraceae species should allow a more detailed
reconstruction of the evolutionary history of the genes.
The motivation for analyzing the genes of aromatics
metabolism in G. metallireducens is to better understand in
situ bioremediation by bacteria [57]. Similarity in the
genes for aromatics degradation between G. metallireducens and the Geobacter species isolated from a toluene-contaminated bioremediation site suggests that the analyses
presented here may be applied more broadly to the Geobacter community that predominates during bioremediation. A method for quantifying gene transcript levels in
Geobacter species in the subsurface was recently developed
[58,59], but has yet to be applied to the metabolism of
aromatics. Hopefully, these results provide candidates for
this type of study, to help clarify the physiological state
and metabolic rates of the in situ species during bioremediation.

Methods
Genome analysis and annotation of genes
The complete G. metallireducens genome sequence was
acquired from NCBI (accession NC_007517) [24]. Refinements of the automatically generated functional predictions for genes putatively involved in aromatics
metabolism were made. Most similar sequences in other
genomes were identified using BLASTp [60] with the nonredundant protein database [61] and UniProt [62]. Identification of functional domains and motifs was made
using InterPro [63]. Transmembrane motifs and signal
sequences were predicted with PsortB [64]. Comparisons
to characterized proteins from aromatics metabolism
were made with BLASTp [60] and alignments were made
with ClustalX [65]. Phylogenetic relationships were
inferred by distance based analysis using the neighbor
joining method [66] in the Mega program [67]. Orthologs
were defined as reciprocal best matches from BLASTp
between two genomes that aligned over at least 60% of
their length [68,69]. Total GC content, first codon position GC content and third codon position GC content
were determined for each ORF in the genome using the
cusp program in EMBOSS [70]. Effective number of
codons (Nc) used was determined for each ORF in the
genome using the chips program in EMBOSS [70]. Dinucleotide relative abundance difference with respect to the
genome average was calculated using delta-rho [71]. GC
content and GC skew (G-C/G+C) were calculated in a
window of 20 kb with a step size of 5 kb.

Cell culturing
G. metallireducens from our laboratory culture collection
was cultured at 30°C in electron donor limited chemostats as previously described [72]. The dilution rate was
0.05 h-1 with acetate (5 mM) or benzoate (1.25 mM) provided as the electron donor and ferric citrate (55 mM) as
the electron acceptor. Acetate concentrations were measured with HPLC (Bio-Rad Aminex HPX-87H column),
Fe(II) concentrations were measured by ferrozine assay,
and protein concentrations were measured by bicinchoninic acid assay, all as previously described [72]. During growth with acetate, Fe(II) was 37.83 ± 1.88 mM,
protein was 0.030 ± 0.005 mg/mL, and acetate was below
detection limit (50 uM). During growth with benzoate,
Fe(II) was 34.45 ± 6.58 mM and protein was 0.023 ±
0.002 mg/mL. Cells were harvested from three replicate
chemostats for each of the electron donors.
Gene expression analysis
RNA extraction, purification, and labeling were performed independently on each cell sample, as previously
described [73]. Total cellular RNA from each replicate was
isolated using TRIZOL (Invitrogen) and purified using
RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) with on-column DNase digestion performed with RNase-free DNase Set (Qiagen). 10
μg of purified total RNA was labeled as previously
described [74], using random hexamers (Invitrogen) for
priming and either Cy3-dUTP or Cy5-dUTP as the fluorophor. After labeling, RNA was removed by NaOH treatment and cDNA was purified with a PCR purification kit
(Qiagen). The labeling efficiency was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm (for DNA concentration),
550 nm (for Cy3), or 650 nm (for Cy5). Two samples of
each total RNA preparation were labeled, one with Cy3dUTP and another with Cy5-dUTP for microarray hybridization.

DNA microarrays covering 3434 of the 3530 annotated
protein-coding sequences of the completed G. metallireducens genome were constructed with 70mer oligonucleotide probes, designed as previously described [73,75]. All
designed oligonucleotides were commercially synthesized
without modification by MWG Biotech Inc. (High Point,
NC). Oligonucleotides were adjusted to 100 pmol/μl in
50% DMSO, and two replicates per probe were spotted
onto UltraGAPS glass slides (Corning Life Science, NY)
using a Microgrid II robotic arrayer (Genomic Solutions
Inc., MI) and fixed by UV cross-linking (600 mJ). Additionally, 6 concentrations (5, 25, 50, 100, 200, and 300
ng/μl) of genomic DNA were spotted (8 duplicates of each
concentration per slide) as positive controls.
Microarray hybridization, washing, and scanning were
carried out as previously described [73]. Cy5-dUTPlabeled cDNA targets from one benzoate culture were

mixed with the Cy3-dUTP-labeled cDNA targets from one
acetate culture and vice versa (dye swap). Equal amounts
of Cy3- or Cy5-labeled probes were mixed and incubated
at 95-98°C for 5 min, centrifuged to collect condensation,
kept at 50°C, and applied onto microarray slides. Hybridization was carried out in hybridization chambers (Corning Life Sciences, Corning, NY) at 45°C for 16–20 h.
Microarray slides were washed according to the instructions by the manufacturer (Corning), and dried with N2.
The fluorescence intensity of both the Cy5 and Cy3 fluorophores was scanned using the ScanArray Express microarray analysis system (Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA).
Signal intensities were determined using 16-bit TIFF
scanned images and ImaGene version 6.0 (Biodiscovery,
Marina Del Rey, Calif.) to quantify spot signal, spot quality, and background fluorescent intensities. Empty spots,
poor spots, and negative spots were flagged according to
instructions and removed in subsequent analysis, as previously described [76]. Lowess normalization was performed on each slide using GeneSpring version 5.1
(Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, Calif.), and the results
for the triplicate cultures were used for statistical analysis.
Student t-test was used to calculate a p-value to test the
null hypothesis that the expression level was unchanged
for each spot. P values equal to or less than 0.01 were considered significant. Results were submitted to NCBI Gene
Expression Omnibus, accession GSE5401.
