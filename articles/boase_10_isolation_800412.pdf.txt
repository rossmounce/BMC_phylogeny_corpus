Abstract
Background: Cyclamen is a popular and economically significant pot plant crop in several countries. Molecular
breeding technologies provide opportunities to metabolically engineer the well-characterized flavonoid biosynthetic
pathway for altered anthocyanin profile and hence the colour of the flower. Previously we reported on a genetic
transformation system for cyclamen. Our aim in this study was to change pigment profiles and flower colours in
cyclamen through the suppression of flavonoid 3', 5'-hydroxylase, an enzyme in the flavonoid pathway that plays a
determining role in the colour of anthocyanin pigments.
Results: A full-length cDNA putatively identified as a F3'5'H (CpF3'5'H) was isolated from cyclamen flower tissue. Amino
acid and phylogeny analyses indicated the CpF3'5'H encodes a F3'5'H enzyme. Two cultivars of minicyclamen were
transformed via Agrobacterium tumefaciens with an antisense CpF3'5'H construct. Flowers of the transgenic lines
showed modified colour and this correlated positively with the loss of endogenous F3'5'H transcript. Changes in
observed colour were confirmed by colorimeter measurements, with an overall loss in intensity of colour (C) in the
transgenic lines and a shift in hue from purple to red/pink in one cultivar. HPLC analysis showed that delphinidinderived pigment levels were reduced in transgenic lines relative to control lines while the percentage of cyanidinderived pigments increased. Total anthocyanin concentration was reduced up to 80% in some transgenic lines and a
smaller increase in flavonol concentration was recorded. Differences were also seen in the ratio of flavonol types that
accumulated.
Conclusion: To our knowledge this is the first report of genetic modification of the anthocyanin pathway in the
commercially important species cyclamen. The effects of suppressing a key enzyme, F3'5'H, were wide ranging,
extending from anthocyanins to other branches of the flavonoid pathway. The results illustrate the complexity
involved in modifying a biosynthetic pathway with multiple branch points to different end products and provides
important information for future flower colour modification experiments in cyclamen.
Background
Cyclamen persicum Mill. (cyclamen) is a popular and economically significant pot plant crop in Japan, Germany,
Italy, the Netherlands and North America. Flower colour
in commercial lines ranges from white, through red, pink,
reddish-purple to purple. The pigments present are predominantly anthocyanins and there have been several
studies on anthocyanin and flavonoid pigmentation in

cyclamen [1-5]. The main anthocyanins are 3,5-di-O-glucosides of peonidin, cyanidin and malvidin (Figure. 1).
There are two missing colour groups in cyclamen, the
orange-red of pelargonidin-derived anthocyanins [6] and
blue, even though some delphinidin-derived anthocyanins often associated with blue flower colours are present
in maroon to purple cultivars [1-3,6].
To date there has only been one reported molecular
breeding experiment involving flavonoid pigments for
cyclamen. It was focused on the generation of yellow
flower colours through the production of yellow flavonoid pigments [7]. Our interest is in altering the antho-

Figure 1 A simplified version of a section of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. The flavonols kaempferol, quercetin and myricetin are formed
from dihydrokaempferol, dihydroquercetin and dihydromyricetin, respectively, by flavonol synthase (FLS). The double arrows show the points of possible action of multiple enzymes for formation and modification of the anthocyanins. Abbreviations are as follows: CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase; DFR, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase; ANS, anthocyanidin synthase; F3'H, flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase; F3'5'H,

cyanin-based colours [8]. In flower colour modification
studies in general, particular attention has been paid to
the enzymes responsible for the hydroxylation of the Bring of the flavonoid molecule, namely F3'H and F3'5'H
(Figure. 1) because of their key influence on the colour of
anthocyanin pigments [9]. Specific experiments to accumulate delphinidin-derived anthocyanins by over expression of a F3'5'H transgene have been reported for
carnation [10] and rose [11], while inhibition of both the
F3'H and the F3'5'H genes has been used to modify colour
and promote cyanidin- and pelargonidin-based pigment
accumulation in flowers in the genera Torenia [12], Nierembergia [13] and Osteospermum [14].

Our strategy for modification of flower colour in cyclamen focused on the F3'5'H. Substrate feeding experiments with DHK and the F3'H/F3'5'H inhibitor
tetcyclacis indicate that the cyclamen DFR can use DHK
and that cyclamen has the ability to make pelargonidinderived anthocyanins (K. Schwinn, unpublished data).
The cloning of a F3'5'H cDNA and our cyclamen genetic
transformation system [15] have allowed us to investigate
flower colour formation in cyclamen. In this study we
report on the effects of antisense suppression of F3'5'H
on flavonoid end-product accumulation and flower
colour.

Results
Isolation and sequence analysis of a cyclamen flavonoid 3',
5'-hydroxylase cDNA

A putative full-length cDNA for F3'5'H (CpF3'5'H) was
isolated from a cDNA library made from mixed flower
bud stages of C. persicum 'Sierra Rose'. The complete
nucleotide sequence has 1719 nucleotides with a single
major ORF encoding 508 amino acid residues (GenBank
accession GQ891056).
When the deduced amino acid sequence for CpF3'5'H
was used in a BLAST search of GenBank http://
www.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/, the closest sequence was the
putative F3'5'H from Camellia sinensis (GenBank accession AAY23287), with 83% amino acid identity. The
Lasergene program MegAlign (DNASTAR Inc., Madison,
USA) was used to compare the CpF3'5'H deduced amino
acid sequence with ten F3'5'H sequences (the CYP75A
group), ten F3'H sequences (CYP75B) and two 'outlier'
cytochrome P450 sequences (data not shown). Amino
acid identity of CpF3'5'H to other F3'5'H sequences was
in the range from 75-82%, except for the Campanula
medium F3'5'H sequence (BAA03440), 68% identity,
which is suggested to have a distinct F3'5'H structure [16]
and the monocot Phalaenopsis hybrida F3'5'H sequence
(AAZ79451, 50% identity) [17]. A phylogenetic tree was
formed using the CLUSTAL W algorithm http://wwwbimas.cit.nih.gov/clustalw/clustalw.html with the MegAlign data (Figure. 2). The F3'5'H sequences form a distinct
cluster, which includes the cyclamen sequence. Based on
the amino acid and phylogeny analysis the evidence supports CpF3'5'H as encoding a F3'5'H enzyme.

Generation of transformed lines and transgene expression
analyses

Antisense CpF3'5'H transformants were produced from
the 'Purple' cultivar using constructs pPN48/51, and from
the 'Wine-Red' cultivar using pLN96/pPN50 (Figure. 3A).
Flowers from several of the transgenic lines showed significant changes in colour, both in hue and intensity
(chroma) (Figure. 4). No other phenotypic alterations
were observed when compared with wildtype plants.
Northern blot analysis of cultivar (cv) 'Purple' transformants showed that eight lines were transgenic for the
hygromycin selectable marker (Figure. 3B). RT-PCR analysis of the nptII selectable marker showed the three cv
'Wine-Red' lines were also transgenic as expected (Figure.
3B).
Northern blot analysis with a mixed sense and antisense CpF3'5'H probe, (1.7 kb XbaI-EcoRI fragment, Figure. 3A), showed that two F3'5'H specific transcripts were
detected (Figure. 3C). There was a marked reduction in
endogenous CpF3'5'H transcript in all antisense lines of
both cultivars. Antisense CpF3'5'H transcript was
detected only in the transgenic lines and the levels varied
between lines.
Flavonoid analyses

Anthocyanin content in the petals of the transgenic lines
changed in both concentration and profile. The anthocyanins detected in the flower tissue of the regeneration
control plants and transgenic lines are shown in Figure. 5
and 6 and are listed in Table 1. Anthocyanin identities
were assigned by retention times and mass spectrometer
data and were consistent with the anthocyanins identified

previously for cyclamen, predominantly the 3-mono and
3,5 di-glucosides of peonidin, cyanidin and malvidin
[2,4]. Malvidin 3-O-glucoside was the predominant
anthocyanin in cv 'Wine-Red' while malvidin 3,5 di-Oglucoside was the predominant anthocyanin in cv 'Purple'.
A change in anthocyanin profile was found in the petal
tissue of the transgenic lines as might be expected with a
reduction in F3'5'H activity (Figure. 6A). Delphinidinderived (malvidin- or petunidin-based anthocyanins) pigment levels decreased as a proportion of the total anthocyanins in petal tissue of most of the transgenic lines
while the proportion of cyanidin-derived pigments
(peonidin- and cyanidin-based anthocyanins) increased.
This shift in anthocyanin profile correlates with a loss of
expression of the endogenous CpF3'5'H transcript (Fig-

ure. 3C). The greater the loss of expression, e.g. cv 'Purple' line #31685 and cv 'Wine-Red' line #31691, the
greater the change in anthocyanin profile (Figure 6B).
Pelargonidin, an anthocyanin pigment with a monohydroxylated B-ring, was not produced in the transgenic
lines of either cultivar.
There was also a marked reduction in total anthocyanin
concentration in petal tissue of the transgenic lines. Lines
with modified flower colour showed a decrease in total
anthocyanin concentration of up to 80% of that in
untransformed controls (Figure. 6B). The difference in
anthocyanin concentrations between the transgenic lines
and their respective controls were statistically significant
at the 5% level.
Flavonol profiles were also examined. Flavonols in the
untransformed and transgenic lines were putatively iden-

Flower colour analysis

Expression of the introduced antisense CpF3'5'H transgene and resulting flavonoid concentration and profile
changes in the transgenic lines were translated into visible flower colour changes (Figure. 4). Cultivar 'Purple'
lines showed a loss of purple colour and became pink,
while the cv 'Wine-Red' lines remained a similar pinkish
hue but with reduced intensity (chroma).
The change in colour observed by eye was quantified by
colour measurements using a colorimeter. The colour
parameters, lightness [L], chroma [C] and hue angle [H°]
were statistically significantly different from controls in
lines with modified flower colour in most lines (Table 3).
The exceptions were lines 31675 (cv 'Purple') and 31698
(cv 'Wine-Red') for L and C values. Both lines exhibited
the least change in their anthocyanin profiles (Figures 6A,
B). The majority of transgenic lines of both cultivars
showed an increase in lightness (L) and a reduced intensity of colour (C). This is consistent with the decreased
anthocyanin concentration in the petal tissue from the
transgenic lines. There was also a clear shift in H° away
from purple in the control line towards red in the transgenic lines of the 'Purple' cultivar. This change in hue

angle correlates with a decrease in the proportion of delphinidin-derived anthocyanins. However line #31685,
which had the largest proportion of cyanidin-derived pigments, did not have the largest shift in H°. Similarly the
only line of the cv 'Wine-Red' transgenics showing a shift
from delphinidin- to cyanidin-derived pigments (line
#31691) did not show a significant change in H° while the
other two transgenics did. The shift in hue angle for the
cv 'Wine-Red' transgenics was in fact back to the purple
region of the colour wheel. The overall shift, however,
was very small and hue angle remained in the red/pink
region.

Discussion
Antisense suppression of CpF3'5'H was successful in
changing anthocyanin profiles and flower colour in cyclamen. A shift from predominantly delphinidin-derived

Boase et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:107
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/107

pigments to a greater relative proportion of cyanidinderived pigments was achieved and in general this
showed up as a concomitant shift in H°, the parameter
indicating colour group. It is interesting that the degree of
change in H° did not correlate with the degree of shift in
pigments. The fact that the transformants also showed
variable drops in total anthocyanin levels and changes in
flavonol level and type illustrates both the links between
the different pools of flavonoid substrates and the importance of the roles that anthocyanin concentration and flavonol copigmentation play in flower colour.
Similar changes in anthocyanin concentration and the
accumulation of cyanidin-derived anthocyanins were
seen for the two different minicyclamen cultivars and yet
the greatest change in H° was seen in the lines of the purple cultivar. This is most likely due to a reduction in the
predominant anthocyanin, malvidin 3-5-di-O-glucoside
in these lines. This anthocyanin has been reported as
being bluer in colour than malvidin mono-glucosides [3].
The predominant anthocyanin in the 'Wine-Red' cultivar
is malvidin 3-O-glucoside and this has been reported to
give pink/purple colours, closer to the colour associated
with cyanidin and peonidin pigments [3].
Pelargonidin-based pigments were not detected in the
flowers of the transgenics. One explanation for their
absence is that suppression of F3'5'H activity was not
complete, as evidenced by the presence of delphinidinderived anthocyanins. This may be either due to inefficiency of the antisense approach (as opposed to hairpin
RNA-induced RNAi [18]), effects due to transgene insertion or copy number [19-21], or the presence of other
unaffected F3'5'H family members. The presence of a
F3'H enzyme in the petals could have also removed substrate for pelargonidin production. We have searched for
a cyclamen F3'H cDNA and found one (GenBank
GU808358) with high deduced amino acid similarity to
known F3'H sequences of other species (81% identity
with the F3'H of gentian). However, transcript levels for
this particular F3'H gene were not detectable by northern
analysis during cyclamen petal development (unpublished data).
Substrate specificity is an important consideration
regarding pelargonidin production. In some species, such
as petunia [22], cymbidium [23,24] and Osteospermum
[14], synthesis of pelargonidin-based anthocyanins is limited by the substrate specificity of the endogenous DFR.
Our substrate feeding experiments (mentioned previously) showed that cyclamen has the ability to make
pelargonidin-derived anthocyanins. It is still possible,
however, that cyclamen DFR has low substrate specificity
for DHK and the action of flavonol synthase (FLS), F3'H
and F3'5'H means that the DHK substrate is not used for
the synthesis of pelargonidin. Retransformation of an
antisense F3'5'H line from this study, with a transgene

Page 9 of 12

encoding a DFR known to efficiently catalyse the reduction of DHK to leucopelargonidin [25-27] could result in
transgenic plants accumulating pelargonidin derivatives
in flowers, as successfully demonstrated for Osteospermum [14]. It remains to be resolved whether there is a
F3'H functioning in the flower. The presence of cyanidinbased pigments in the flowers of the antisense CpF3'5'H
lines suggests F3'H activity. Thus, inhibition of either
F3'H or FLS gene activity to reduce enzymatic competition for DHK substrate may also be necessary to promote
pelargonidin production in DFR/antisense F3'5'H transgenics.
In the cyclamen transgenic lines, total anthocyanin levels decreased markedly while flavonol levels increased
and the quercetin/kaempferol ratio changed. Similar
results were reported for Nierembergia flowers modified
with an antisense F3'5'H construct and were suggested to
be due to a modified flow through the flavonoid pathway
[13]. A block in F3'5'H activity resulted in an increase in
pelargonidin precursors. Low F3'H activity coupled with
a DFR that putatively does not recognise DHK, was suggested to have led to limited substrate flow toward pigment production and an increase in the sustrate pool for
FLS [13]. The flavonoid enzyme kinetics are not known
for cyclamen. However, if the cyclamen DFR has a low
specificity for pelargonidin or cyanidin precursors (as the
reduction in total anthocyanins (Figure. 6B) suggests) this
would provide extra substrate for the FLS enzyme and
explain the increased flavonol levels. Competition for
substrate between FLS and DFR has also been shown to
occur in petunia [28,29].
It is interesting that while flavonol levels generally
increased in the transgenics, there were differences in the
quercetin/kaempferol ratios between the lines of the different cultivars. Quercetin flavonols increased in cv 'Purple' lines while kaempferol types increased in cv 'WineRed' lines. This inverse result and the consistency of the
ratio change within lines of each cultivar argues against
the suppression of F3'5'H activity directly altering the balance of DHK and DHQ, and thus what is available for the
FLS. Furthermore, differing substrate specificities of their
respective FLS cannot account for the observed results.
Differing specificities of other enzymes are likely to be
the cause. The probable candidate is F3'H, which in other
species can not only alter the balance between DHK and
DHQ, but also convert kaempferol to quercetin [30]. Further studies of cyclamen flower colour would warrant a
continued search for a F3'H.

Conclusions
We report here the first successful alteration of cyclamen
anthocyanin pigmentation using genetic modification
techniques. Our results highlight the intricate interplay
between type and concentration of both anthocyanin pig-

Methods

Northern blot analyses

Cloning of F3'5'H cDNA and sequence analysis

A cDNA library from mixed flower stages of C. persicum
'Sierra Rose' petals was made using a lambda ZAPII bacteriophage vector kit (Stratagene, USA). This library was
first screened with a heterologous clone of F3'H from
petunia (Florigene Flowers, Australia) and a partial
F3'5'H cDNA was found. The partial F3'5'H cDNA was
used to rescreen the cDNA library to obtain a full length
CpF3'5'H cDNA.
The MegAlign programme of Lasergene (DNASTAR
Inc., Madison, USA) was used to compare the CpF3'5'H
deduced amino acid sequence to ten known F3'5'H
sequences (Camellia sinensis AAY23287; Campanula
medium BAA03440; Catharanthus roseus CAA09850;
Eustoma grandiflorum BAA03439; Glycine max
ABQ96218; Gossypium hirsutum AAP31058; Petunia
hybrida CAA80266; Phalaenopsis hybrida AAZ79451;
Solanum tuberosum AAV85473; Vitis vinifera
BAE47007), ten F3'H sequences (Antirrhinum majus
ABB53383; Arabidopsis thaliana NP_196416; Glycine
max ABW69386; Ipomoea tricolor BAD00192; Matthiola
incana AAG49301; Perilla frutescens BAB59005; Petunia
hybrida AAD56282; Populus trichocarpa XP_002319761;
Sorghum bicolor ABG54321; Vitis vinifera ABH06586),
cinnamate 4-hydroxylase from Arabidopsis thaliana
(AAC99993) and flavone synthase II from Medicago truncatula (ABC86159).
Construction of binary vectors

The CpF3'5'H cDNA was cloned into the EcoRI multiple
cloning site of pART7 [31] in the antisense orientation to
form pLN95. The NotI fragment from pLN95, which contains the 35S:antisenseF3'5'H:Ocs expression cassette,
was ligated into the binary vectors; pART27 [31] to make
pLN96, pMOA33 [32] to make pPN50, pMOA 34 [32] to
make pPN51, and BJ49 [31] to make pPN48 (Figure. 3A).
These binary vectors carried either the nptII or hpt
selectable marker genes under a NOS promoter (Figure.
3A).
Transformation with Agrobacterium tumefaciens

Etiolated hypocotyls of two parental lines of F1 hybrid
minicyclamen cv 'Purple' and cv 'Wine-Red' were used as
explants for transformation experiments. A. tumefaciens
strain EHA105 containing either pLN96, pPN48, pPN50
or pPN51 were used to inoculate explants. The transformation protocol used was that reported by Boase et al.
[15] except that hygromycin was used as the selection

RNA was extracted from petal tissue for northern blot
analysis using a modified hot borate method [33,34].
RNA was separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose
RNA gel and subsequently transferred to Hybond XL
nylon membranes using a SSC overnight blotting
method. The membranes were hybridized with appropriate radioactively-labelled probes. The probe for hpt was a
1.1 kb XhoI fragment digested from pCAMBIA1301,
which contained the hpt gene. The probe for F3'5'H was a
1.7 kb XbaI-EcoRI fragment digested from pLN95. Both
membranes were also rehybrised to a cDNA probe corresponding to a 25/26S rRNA (pTip6) from Asparagus officinalis, to show RNA loadings. Autoradiography was
conducted at -80°C using Kodak Biomax X-ray film.
RT-PCR analysis of nptII mRNA transcripts

To investigate the expression of the introduced nptII
selectable marker recombinant gene, RT-PCR analysis
was performed on RNA extracted from petals using a
modified hot borate method [33,34]. Three independent
transgenic lines of cv 'Wine-Red' (#31691, #31695 and
#31698) and one untransformed control (#29009) were
tested. First strand cDNA was reverse transcribed from
100ngRNA per sample using Superscript II (Invitrogen
USA) and oligo dT primer, and then 1 μl of the resulting
cDNA per line was used for the PCR. For PCR, initial
denaturation was at 94°C for 2 min followed by 40 cycles
of melting (94°C/30 s), annealing (50°C/30 s) and extension (72°C/2 min). The nptII primers used were: forward
5'-ATGACTGGGCACAACAGACCATCGGCTGCT-3'
and reverse, 5'-CGGGTAGCCAACGCTATGTCCTGATAGCGG-3'.
PCR products were separated electrophoretically on a
1% (w/v) NaB agarose gel stained with Sybr®safe (Invitrogen USA).
Flavonoid analyses

Flavonoids were analysed by high performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) and liquid chromatography
mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Freeze dried tissue was
used for the analysis. Samples of ground freeze-dried
petal tissue (50mg DW) were extracted initially in 2ml of
methanol:acetic acid:water (70:3:27) and then reextracted in 2 ml methanol:acetic acid:water (90:1:9). The
combined supernatants were concentrated in vacuo and
made up to a final volume of 1ml. HPLC analysis was carried out using a Waters 600 solvent delivery system with a
Phenomenex Prodigy (5 μm, 250 × 4.6 mm) RP-18 end-

capped column (column temperature 30°C) and a Waters
996 PDA detector. Solvent systems, flow rates and gradients are as described by Bloor et al. [35]. Flavonoids were
detected at 350nm and anthocyanins at 530nm. Flavonoid levels were determined as quercetin-3-O-rhamnoglucoside (Apin Chemicals, Abingdon, Oxon, UK)
equivalents, and the anthocyanins as cyanidin 3-O-glucoside (Extrasynthese, Genay, France) equivalents. Results
are reported as the mean of the two replicates.
Separate extracts were analysed by electrospray mass
spectrometry with a Thermo Finnigan LTQ ion-trap
mass spectrometer. A Synergi Fusion RP80, 4 μm, 150 ×
2.1 mm column with 4 × 2 mm guard cartridge from Phenomenex Ltd was used for separation. The mobile phase
consisted of water (A) and acetonitrile (B) both containing 1% formic acid (FA). Extracts were injected at 5 μL
volumes with a gradient program from 95% A to 50% A
over 50 min. The column was washed by ramping to 90%
B for 5 min and then re-equilibrated to the starting conditions for a further 5 min. Compound elution was monitored by PDA detector scanning the range 250-600 nm
and by mass scanning from m/z 150-1500 to collect parent, MS2 and MS3 data in positive and negative ion (additional run) selection modes.
Flower colorimeter analysis

Colours in all lines were quantified by measurement of
three petals of each flower, three flowers per line with a
Minolta CR-200 tristimulus colorimeter, set on CIELab
D65 light source and 0° observer angle. Lightness (L) represents the proportion of total incident light that is
reflected. Chroma (C) describes the degree to which
selective absorption occurs i.e. colour saturation in relative intensity units. Hue angle (H) is derived from a CIELAB colour space wheel with values stepped
counterclockwise from red at 0°/360°, yellow at 90°, bluish-green at 180° and blue at 270° [36].
Statistics

A one-way ANOVA was performed on each data set
shown in Tables 2 &3 and Figure 6B followed by a comparison of means using either a 5% Fisher's Least Significant Difference (5% LSD) to compare each line with a
single control, or contrasts to compare each line with the
combined mean of two controls. Lines with values significantly different from their control (or pair of controls) at
the 5% level have been indicated by adding a superscript a
to the means in Tables 2 and 3, and in Figure 6B. All analyses were performed using GenStat statistical software
[37].
