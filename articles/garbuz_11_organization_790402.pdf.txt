Abstract
Background: Previously, we described the heat shock response in dipteran species belonging to the family
Stratiomyidae that develop in thermally and chemically contrasting habitats including highly aggressive ones.
Although all species studied exhibit high constitutive levels of Hsp70 accompanied by exceptionally high
thermotolerance, we also detected characteristic interspecies differences in heat shock protein (Hsp) expression
and survival after severe heat shock. Here, we analyzed genomic libraries from two Stratiomyidae species from
thermally and chemically contrasting habitats and determined the structure and organization of their hsp70
clusters.
Results: Although the genomes of both species contain similar numbers of hsp70 genes, the spatial distribution of
hsp70 copies differs characteristically. In a population of the eurytopic species Stratiomys singularior, which exists in
thermally variable and chemically aggressive (hypersaline) conditions, the hsp70 copies form a tight cluster with
approximately equal intergenic distances. In contrast, in a population of the stenotopic Oxycera pardalina that
dwells in a stable cold spring, we did not find hsp70 copies in tandem orientation. In this species, the distance
between individual hsp70 copies in the genome is very large, if they are linked at all. In O. pardalina we detected
the hsp68 gene located next to a hsp70 copy in tandem orientation. Although the hsp70 coding sequences of
S. singularior are highly homogenized via conversion, the structure and general arrangement of the hsp70 clusters
are highly polymorphic, including gross aberrations, various deletions in intergenic regions, and insertion of
incomplete Mariner transposons in close vicinity to the 3’-UTRs.
Conclusions: The hsp70 gene families in S. singularior and O. pardalina evolved quite differently from one another.
We demonstrated clear evidence of homogenizing gene conversion in the S. singularior hsp70 genes, which form
tight clusters in this species. In the case of the other species, O. pardalina, we found no clear trace of concerted
evolution for the dispersed hsp70 genes. Furthermore, in the latter species we detected hsp70 pseudogenes,
representing a hallmark of the birth-and-death process.

Background
The heat shock response is a universal phenomenon,
and heat shock proteins (Hsps) form the most ancient
and sophisticated cellular defense system present in all
living organisms [1,2]. The Hsps are broadly classified
on the basis of their molecular weights and functions
into distinct families, with the Hsp70 family being the
best studied and among the most important for cell protection [3,4]. Though the heat shock response is a universal phenomenon, various organisms even within the
taxonomic groups of relatively low rank (e.g., order,
family) often evolve different strategies to adapt to
aggressive environments [4-8].
The mechanisms providing whole body adaptation of
animals to various adverse conditions, including extreme
thermal environments, have long attracted the attention
of ecologists. After the description of Hsps in Drosophila and other organisms [1,9], we undertook systematic studies to establish a possible correlation between
the general pattern of Hsp synthesis and whole-body
adaptation to extreme conditions [7,10,11]. It is noteworthy that the predominant fraction of investigations
on the stress response have largely (but not entirely)
been previously performed on a small number of model
organisms in the laboratory and, therefore, have limited
value in an ecological context. Keeping this in mind we
usually included in our investigation related species or
geographical strains from nature, in particular those
inhabiting biotopes or regions with strikingly contrasting
average temperatures [8,11-14]. Using this approach, we,
as well as other research groups, have accumulated
abundant data showing that animals have evolved a variety of strategies to adjust their heat shock systems to
changing environmental conditions [4,7]. Long-term and
large-scale studies of the Hsps gene system in species
and geographical strains that differ in the temperature
of habitats, performed in various laboratories, have disclosed a few basic patterns in the functioning and evolution of this system in organisms living under adverse
conditions [4,5,11,15-17].
In the course of these studies, it was repeatedly
demonstrated that noticeable cellular levels of Hsps
and/or corresponding RNA under normal physiological
temperatures represent one of the most common adaptations to stressful conditions described in various
organisms, including certain species of lizards, flies and
ants [11,15,18].
In particular, in order to investigate how organisms
have evolved to occupy contrasting habitats, we compared four species of Stratiomyidae (Diptera) whose larvae develop in naturally varying (semi)aquatic habitats,
including highly aggressive conditions of hot volcanic
springs [8]. Previously we have demonstrated that larvae

Page 2 of 17

of all these species, independently of their thermal history, show a high level of inducible Hsp70 under “normal” physiological conditions (constitutive or chronic
expression), and that the level increases only 2 - 3 fold
after a 30 minutes heat shock treatment and 24 hours of
recovery. Larvae of these species are able to survive
exceptionally heavy heat shock treatments (46 - 48°C),
which are lethal to most of other dipteran species studied so far [19-21].
We also demonstrated that Oxycera pardalina Meigen, 1822, a Stratiomyidae species confined to cold and
thermally constant environments, shows the highest
relative heat-shock tolerance (i.e. can survive the largest
shift in temperature as compared to that in its normal
habitat). Whether and how the evolutionary alteration
of Hsp70 expression and thermotolerance among the
Stratiomyidae species involves changes to the hsp70
genes themselves remain unanswered questions.
Here we report the results of molecular analyses performed to compare the general arrangements and sequence
of hsp70-containing loci in two Stratiomyidae species from
contrasting thermal environments, O. pardalina and Stratiomys singularior Harris, 1776. For this purpose, we cloned
and sequenced member genes of the hsp70 gene superfamily from the two species compared.
Our studies have demonstrated that the population of
S. singularior that inhabits an area with very instable
extreme larval habitats and strongly variable conditions,
is characterized by a compact hsp70 cluster of 5 converting hsp70 genes. Contrastingly, the stable and constantly cold habitat-dwelling O. pardalina exhibits quite
different distribution and spacing of hsp70 copies in the
genome.

Results
General organization of hsp70 clusters in S. singularior
and O. pardalina

The detailed organization of hsp70 genes in S. singularior
and O. pardalina emerges from the subcloning and
sequencing of overlapping lambda clones isolated from
genomic libraries (Figures 1A and 1B). We have isolated
twenty lambda clones from a S. singularior genomic
library, and after preliminary restriction analysis have
chosen nine clones which apparently contain one or
several complete hsp70 genes (Figure 1A). From these
nine phages we have isolated and described four hsp70
copies in tandem orientation (hsp70S2-S5) and a fifth
copy in inverse orientation (hsp70S1). Genes S2 - S5 are
not identically spaced, and intergenic regions vary:
approximately 4.7 kb between hsp70S3 and S4, 5.3 kb
between hsp70S4 and S5, 5.9 kb between hsp70S2 and S3,
and 1.2 kb between hsp70S1 and S2. The whole hsp70
cluster of S. singularior was sequenced, and surprisingly

Garbuz et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:74

we failed to detect any significant homology among the
intergenic regions between individual hsp70 genes.
Characteristically, we detected various polymorphisms
within the same intergenic regions isolated from individual clones. These polymorphisms include the insertion
of a fragment (314 bp in length) of Mariner transposon
in the hsp70S2-hsp70S3 intergenic region detected in all
four phages containing these genes (phages 10, 71, 52
and 5). Furthermore, hsp70 copies in S. singularior cluster are subject to gross rearrangement, and although
their order in most phages is S2, S3 and S4, in phages
33 and 51 the S5 gene is located after S3, while in
phage 52 an inverted pair is formed by S1 and S3 genes
(Figure 1A).
Interestingly, we detected deletions in almost all the
hsp70 intergenic regions. In phage 8, there is a 1 kb
deletion in the S4 - S5 region, phage 71 contains a 2 kb
deletion in the hsp70S2 - hsp70S3 region, and phage 33
contains a 2kb deletion in the S3 - S5 intergenic region.
In phage 71, a deletion in the 5’-flank of hsp70S3
includes the beginning of the transcribed region and
essential heat shock regulatory elements; this deletion
may make this hsp70S3 allele noninducible (Figure 1A).
The general organization of the hsp70 genes in
O. pardalina characteristically differs from that of
S. singularior (Figure 1). Preliminary Southern blot analysis of eleven lambda clones isolated from O. pardalina
genomic DNA and carrying hsp70 sequences showed
that most of the cloned fragments contained only a single hsp70 copy (data not shown). This implies that most
hsp70 copies in this species, with two prominent exceptions described below, are unlinked or at least located
at significantly larger distances from each other than
the hsp70 genes in S. singularior. We performed a
detailed restriction analysis of seven lambda clones isolated from the O. pardalina genomic library, which
contained the complete sequences of one or two hsp70
family copies (Figure 1B); the other four phages were
excluded from the detailed analysis, because they contained only fragments of hsp70 genes and did not carry
overlapping sequences, judging by cross hybridization
with their labeled terminal fragments (data not shown).
Phage B2 contains one complete copy of hsp70 (P1)
and a 5’-fragment of another hsp70 copy (P2) in inverse
orientation, apparently cut by Sau3A in the process of
cloning (Figure 1B). Although we were able to detect
two copies of hsp70 in inverse orientation in O. pardalina in phage B2, even in this case, the distance between
these copies was 4.6 kb, i.e. four times as large as the
correspondent intergenic region between the inverted S1
and S2 genes in S. singularior (Figure 1 A, B). The 5’flanking regions of all hsp70 copies in O. pardalina
exhibit extended homology upstream from transcription
start (up to 650 bp including 5’-UTRs), while in

Page 4 of 17

S. singularior, 5’-flanking homology in the correspondent intergenic region is evident only within approximately 200 bp. This implies that in O. pardalina, the
hsp70 genes undergo concerted evolution (i.e. interlocus
recombination) in blocks containing more than 650 bp
of 5’-flanking sequences, while in S. singularior concertedly evolving blocks include less than 200 bp of 5’-flanking sequences.
Figure 1B depicts four phages containing essentially
the same hsp70 genes (i.e. clones 61 and 6 and 7b and
7). These phages are included into this figure to illustrate that in contrast to S. singularior, hsp70 genes in
O. pardalina are not arranged in tight clusters, and
indeed may be entirely unlinked. It is noteworthy that
sequencing of hsp70 genes and intergenic regions from
these phages did not reveal any differences. Hence, we
conclude that phages 61 and 6 and 7b and 7 contain
DNA from full sibs.
In O. pardalina, we observed two hsp70 pseudogenes
(Figure 1B). The pseudogene located in phage B1 is 89%
homologous to hsp70P1 and contains several short deletions resulting in ORF shifts. The other pseudogene, isolated from phage 8, is also homologous to hsp70P1
(86%) and represents a highly rearranged copy. It contains a long deletion (306 bp) and inversion (677 bp) in
the coding region of the gene. This pseudogene does
not contain the first ATG codon. Both pseudogenes lack
HSE elements and fail to exhibit any homology with
functional hsp70 genes of O. pardalina in the 5’-flanking
regions. The O. pardalina hsp70 pseudogenes likely
arose by retroposition, as suggested for similar duplicated hsp70 genes and pseudogenes in Drosophila
[22,23]. Clones 7 and 7b contain homologous stretches
of DNA carrying two tandem copies of genes belonging to
the hsp70 family, located within a 3.5 kb interval. Interestingly, one copy is the inducible hsp70P4, and the second
copy is probably hsp68 (see below). This is the first case to
our knowledge when hsp70 and hsp68 genes were found
to be so closely linked. Therefore, the detailed analysis of
genomic libraries enabled us to describe five potentially
functional hsp70 genes in S. singularior and five genes
belonging to the hsp70 family, including a presumptive
hsp68 gene, in O. pardalina. In order to make sure that
we cloned and sequenced all or at least most of the hsp70
genes from the species compared, we performed a conventional Southern blot analysis using genomic DNA isolated
from both species.

isolated with the exception O. pardalina pseudogenes

sequencing data) to the hybridizing bands is indicated on the left
of the lanes.

to a probe specific for the 5’- and 3’-regions of the
S. singularior hsp70 coding sequence. The data depicted
in Figure 2 confirm the results of the genomic libraries
analysis described above, and show that the S. singularior genome apparently contains five copies of hsp70,
while O. pardalina contains four hsp70 copies. Moreover, based on sequencing data we were able to establish
the correspondence between individual hsp70 copies and
hybridizing bands (see below and Figure 2). Thus, we
have cloned and sequenced most if not all copies of
hsp70 genes present in the genomes of both species.
The additional minor bands seen in genomic DNA of
S. singularior isolated from different numbers of larvae
(Figure 2) may be explained by restriction site polymorphism or polymorphism in the structure of hsp70
genes per se and/or their flanking regions.
Preliminary 3’-RACE analysis of cDNA homologous to
heat shock inducible RNA isolated from both species
based on 3’-UTR heterogeneity in general has confirmed
our conclusions about the hsp70 copy number estimated
for both species, and indicates that all hsp70 copies

Sequence analysis revealed all components of hsp70 regulatory machinery in the 5’-UTR regions of most hsp70
genes of both species compared. The results of comparing promoter regions in both species are depicted in
Figure 3. The general structure of the Drosophila melanogaster hsp70 promoter is given for comparison.
We aligned the promoters of the hsp70S genes separately, since divergence among the genes becomes significant at approximately 40 bp upstream of the TATA
signal (See Additional files 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5: Figures S1,
S2, S3, S4 and S5 for individual alignments of the
S. singularior hsp70 gene promoters). In S. singularior,
promoters of individual hsp70 genes vary (Figure 3).
Four candidate heat shock elements ("HSEs”) are evident
in the promoters of hsp70S1 and hsp70S2. In hsp70S3,
hsp70S4, and hsp70S5, only three candidate HSEs are
observed. Additionally, the promoters of hsp70S3, S4,
and S5 contain indels and rearrangements. hsp70S352
contains a repetitive 39 bp insertion upstream of the
TATA signal that ablates all but the most proximal of
the HSEs (See Additional file 3: Figure S3). hsp70S533
has a similar type of 60 bp insertion upstream of the
TATA signal, flanked by an hsp70S4-derived conversion
tract (See Additional file 5: Figure S5). Whether these
indels and rearrangements modulate hsp70 expression,
as has been observed for Drosophila hsp70 genes
[24,25], remains to be tested. Interestingly, in the same
phages (52, 51 and 33) we observed gross rearrangements of the whole cluster (i.e. hsp70S3 in the place of
hsp70S2 in phage 52, and hsp70S5 in the place of
hsp70S4 in phages 51 and 33). The insertions of repetitive DNA thus likely represent the footprints of transposable elements responsible for the reshuffling of the
hsp70 cluster observed in these particular phages. Intralocus unequal recombination likely occurred, because
the promoter region of gene S3 in phage 52 is highly
homologous to gene S2, including conversion tracts.
Similarly, the promoter region of gene S5 from phages
33 and 51 is practically identical to that of S4. The sites
of presumptive recombination breaks are shown by vertical arrows in Figure 1A.
The transcription start point was found to be identical
in both species studied (see Figure 3). We identified the
hsp70 transcription start by 5’-RACE using RNA isolated
after HS from the larvae of both species, as described in
Methods.
In all S. singularior hsp70 genes, the distance between
TATA and transcription start point (AGT) is 24 bp, and

horizontal rectangles. TATA-boxes are indicated by triangles (T). The shaded rectangles indicate the positions of non-canonical HSEs. Vertical
rectangles indicate the positions of GAGA sites (G). The black bended arrows mark the transcription start and direction. D. melanogaster hsp70
promoter (from 70A region) is given at the bottom for comparison. Asterisks above the O. pardalina regulatory region mark single nucleotide

the start codon is located 230 bp further downstream. In
this species, all hsp70 TATA-boxes are represented by
5’-TATATATA-3’ nucleotides, and GAG or GAGA corresponds to the position of the presumptive GAGA-factor binding site.
We aligned approximately 660 bp of promoter
sequence from the four Oxycera hsp70 genes. These
promoters are 93% identical to one another, and each
contains four candidate HSEs in homologous positions
ranging from 27 - 28 to 222 - 224 bp upstream of the
TATA signal, which is represented by sequence
TATAAATA (Figure 3).
The promoter of presumptive hsp68, cloned from O.
pardalina, also contains a canonical TATA-box
(TATAAATG), several GAG sequences, and four HSEs
(Figure 3).
It is evident that essential regulatory elements located
in the promoter regions of the two species hsp70 genes
(i.e. HSEs and GAG or GAGA) vary in number and spacing when comparing between genes and species. In
general, the spacing of major regulatory elements (HSEs

and GAGA) in O. pardalina is more similar to that of
D. melanogaster (Figure 3). All the above supports that
promoters of both Stratiomyidae species studied are
functional heat-inducible promoters.
Sequence analysis and evolutionary relationships
of hsp70 transcriptional units in O. pardalina and
S. singularior

Oxycera pardalina: We recovered the full sequence of
one allele for each of the hsp70P1, hsp70P2, and
hsp70P4 genes. These genes are intronless and contain a
1920 bp CDS.
The three whole CDSs are on average 98.4% identical,
diverging by 20 - 27 silent and 5 - 10 replacement substitutions (See Additional file 6: Table S1 for numbers
of silent and replacement fixed differences). The 5’UTRs of the three intact hsp70 genes are 252 - 260 bp
long and 91% identical (data not shown).
We recovered 325 - 340 bp of alignable sequence
downstream of the three cloned intact hsp70 CDSs;
sequence identity in this region is 77%. In contrast to

Garbuz et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:74

9: Figure S7). Only the first 15 bp of the hsp70S371 5’UTR could be aligned; the UTR is disrupted by large
blocks of repetitive sequences upstream of this position,
consistent with insertion and/or rearrangement via
transposition. Whether this rearrangement alters the
expression of hsp70S371 is unknown. The homogeneity
observed in the hsp70S CDSs diminishes in the 5’-UTRs.
The 5’-UTRs are 82% identical overall; linkage disequilibrium is higher than in the CDSs, and four blocks of
linked, polymorphic sites that are shared among genes
are strongly suggestive of conversion tracts (See grey
bars in Additional file 9: Figure S7). Seventeen individual SNPs are shared among multiple genes, again consistent with gene conversion (black bars in Additional
file 9: Figure S7).
The 3’-UTRs of the S. singularior hsp70 genes are
more divergent than those of O. pardalina. In S. singularior the distance of a typical PolyA signal (AATAAA)
from the stop codon, determined by 3’-RACE, varies
from 193 to 247 bp in individual hsp70 copies.
In O. pardalina the position of a candidate polyadenylation signal slightly varies in individual copies of hsp70
genes and falls 183 - 186 bp downstream of the stop
codon.
As for the 5’-UTRs, we sequenced 3’-UTRs of more
alleles than just those for which we obtained full-length
CDSs; more than 2 alleles of each hsp70S gene 3’-UTR
were completely sequenced (Figure 1A). In contrast to
the 5’-UTRs, which could all be aligned as one group,
we aligned the 3’-UTRs of hsp70S1, hsp70S4, and
hsp70S5 separately for visualization since their shared
sequence is less than 100 bp long. Multiple candidate
polyadenylation signals are found in all the 3’-UTRs.
Only hsp70S2 and hsp70S3 share significant sequence
identity. In general, the 3’-UTRs vary to a greater extent
than both the CDSs and 5’-UTRs, with sequence identity
<80% (See Additional files 10, 11, 12 and 13: Figures S8,
S9, S10 and S11 for alignments of the 3’-UTRs).
Hsp70SS352 has a deletion eliminating most of the 3’UTR, approximately 47 bp downstream of the stop
codon; the effects of this deletion were not tested but
are consistent with rearrangements outside the hsp70
CDSs observed in the 5’-UTR and promoter (see above,

the near identity of hsp70P1, P3, and P4, two hsp70
pseudogenes, denoted ψhsp70 B1 and ψhsp70 8 , bear
numerous indels and substitutions and do not encode
full-length proteins. The UTRs and promoter regions of
both pseudogenes were fully sequenced and aligned.
However, we found neither potential HSE and TATA
boxes nor any significant homology between these
regions (data not shown).
Stratiomys singularior: We sequenced multiple alleles
of all five hsp70 genes: hsp70S1, 3 alleles; hsp70S2, 2;
hsp70S3, 4; hsp70S4, 2; hsp70S5, 5. Alleles are named
according to the clones from which they were obtained
(Figure 1A). All alleles contain an intronless, 1917 bp
CDS; no pseudogenes were recovered. The CDSs are
more similar to one another than was seen in O. pardalina; an average of seven fixed differences distinguish
any pair of S. singularior hsp70 CDSs (See Additional
file 7: Table S2 for MK tests results), for an average
pairwise identity of 99.6%. Comparing the hsp70S genes
to one another via MacDonald-Kreitman style tests
reveals that in all cases, the number of polymorphisms
is much greater than the number of fixed differences,
and that both polymorphism and divergence are similarly skewed towards silent substitutions (Additional file
7: Table S2). These results are consistent with concerted
evolution and purifying selection.
The mechanism of concerted evolution among the
hsp70S CDSs is likely gene conversion, observed for
other insect hsp70 genes [22,23]. There are 50 singlenucleotide polymorphisms ("SNPs”) shared among the
hsp70S genes (black bars in Additional file 8, Figure S6).
Considering only the silent polymorphisms, to avoid
confounding any effects of positive or balancing selection, we examined the probabilities of shared SNPs arising among the hsp70S genes via independent mutation
or gene conversion using the method of Rozas and
Aguade [26]. Table 1 indicates that in all pairwise comparisons of hsp70S genes, we can reject the null hypothesis of independent mutation at P < 10-5.
We recovered and aligned 262 bp of 5’-UTR sequence
from all the hsp70S genes/alleles whose CDSs were
completely sequenced, plus one additional allele for
each of hsp70S3, hsp70S4, and hsp70S5 (Additional file

below). Only hsp70S2 and hsp70S3 show evidence of
gene conversion in the 3’-UTR: in clone 5, hsp70S2’s 3’UTR has been converted over at least 300 bp to exactly
resemble the 3’-UTR of hsp70S3 (see grey bars in Additional file 11: Figure S9). Similarly, in clone 10,
hsp70S3’s 3’-UTR has been converted with hsp70S2’s.
These less frequent, larger, and unbroken conversion
tracts, along with the overall higher degrees of divergence among and polymorphism within 3’-UTRs, indicate less homogenization via gene conversion. This
apparent reduction in conversion is more pronounced
than is observed in the 5’-UTRs, which show both large
tracts and the multiple shared SNPs indicative of

homogenizing gene conversion. The net effect of conversion among CDSs with divergence among 3’-UTRs is
evident in comparative phylogenetic trees (Figure 4). In
the CDS tree, only hsp70S5 resolves as a clade and is
supported by a majority of bootstrap trials. In contrast,
the 3’-UTR tree contains hsp70S1, hsp70S4, and
hsp70S5 clades, all with strong bootstrap support, and
only the wholly-converted hsp70S2/hsp70S3 alleles from
clones 5 and 10 prevent the assemblage of hsp70S2 and
hsp70S3 clades. Thus, the hsp70S CDSs evolve in concert; the 3’-UTRs evolve largely independently.

polymorphic flanks that contain large indels, is consistent with duplicated hsp70s in Drosophila.
Inducible proteins encoded by hsp70 family genes in
S. singularior and O. pardalina

Most of the varying sites in hsp70 genes of both species
are silent and, hence, the deduced Hsp70s at amino acid
level are highly homologous. Thus S. singularior individual Hsp70s exhibit almost 97% homology, while their
homology with O. pardalina and D. melanogaster
Hsp70s reaches 93% and 82%, respectively. Furthermore,
the homology between deduced individual Hsp70s of
O. pardalina reaches 99%. Characteristically, most of
the varying sites in both species are localized in the
C-domain of Hsp70, which is expected based on the
above-presented data and the results of other authors
showing a higher level of divergence at the 3’-ends of
hsp70 genes in Drosophila [27,23]. The molecular
weights of individual S. singularior Hsp70s (deduced by
Vector NTI) are 69.89 - 70.18 kD and pI 5.48 - 5.75.
In order to further characterize Hsp70 family members in the species compared, we have performed twodimensional electrophoresis of total proteins from
O. pardalina and S. singularior with subsequent immunoblotting with the 7FB antibody, which in D. melanogaster reacts only with inducible Hsp70s, and with the
7.10.3 antibody, which reacts with all members of the
Hsp70 family in most Diptera species examined including Hsp68 [8].
The molecular weights of individual O. pardalina
Hsp70 members deduced by Vector NTI (69.85 - 69.96
kD) and pI (5.45 - 5.46) vary and practically coincide
with the results of 2D electrophoresis of O. pardalina
proteins (Figure 5).
The 7.10.3, but not 7FB, antibody revealed one lower
molecular weight protein, which characteristically has a
slightly more acidic isoelectric point than the presumptive Hsp70 (Figure 5). We hypothesized that this particular protein corresponded to D. melanogaster Hsp68.
Importantly, the molecular weight of this protein and pI
revealed by 2D (69.1 and 5.4 correspondently) practically
coincide with those of Hsp68 deduced basing on the presumptive hsp68 gene sequence located in phage 7 and 7b
of O. pardalina (69.14 kD and 5.36).
Using Coomassie stained gels we have isolated spots
of expected pI for the Hsp70 family members and performed fingerprinting and microsequencing analysis as
described previously [8]. In both species, inducible proteins of interest are represented by a few isoforms,
which are well separated on the gel and easy to isolate
(Figure 5). After in-gel trypsin digestion and fingerprinting analysis using MALDI-ToF, the National Center for
Biotechnology Information database was searched with
the Profound search engine. This search has established

that as expected the excised 70 kDa spots in both species correspond to members of the Hsp70 family previously described in various Diptera species (Additional
file 1, Figure S12).
The predicted Hsp70 polypeptide of S. singularior and
O. pardalina consists of 638 a.a. and 639 a.a., respectively, and presents all classic Hsp70 family signatures,
including the presence of the serine residue in the
ATPase domain (Additional file 14: Figure S12 for comparison with paralogs from several organisms) that characterizes the inducible HSP70 proteins of invertebrates
[28]. We also detected a few amino acids residues specific for the both Stratiomyidae species and other highly
thermotolerant organisms e.g. Locusta migratoria (Additional file 15: Figure S12). Conceptual translation
showed that Stratiomyidae Hsp70 sequences had 72%
identity with human Hsp70 and 84 - 85% identity with
D. melanogaster Hsp70.
Our microsequencing data together with phylogenetic
analysis and description of typical hsps promoters enable
to conclude that all hsp70 genes isolated, with the prominent exception of the two O. pardalina pseudogenes,
definitely represent inducible members of hsp70 family.
Previously we have shown that all four Stratiomyidae
species exhibit high thermotolerance, correlated with
high constitutive cellular levels of Hsp70. Surprisingly,
Northern hybridization experiments failed to demonstrate hsp70 expression under normal physiological conditions, and only using a highly sensitive RT-PCR
technique we were able to detect a very weak leakage of
hsp70 genes in the species studied [8]. Surprisingly, the
accumulation of Hsps in the cells of these species after
heat shock challenge continues for many hours after HS

treatment and, therefore, inducible Hsp70s in these species are probably more stable in comparison with Drosophila and many other Diptera species [29]. Based on
these data, it was of significant interest to compare the
amino acid sequence of Stratiomyidae Hsp70s with the
sequence of Hsp70s isolated from other animals. The
results of this analysis are shown in Figure 6.
Roughly, the dendrogram reflects the accepted phylogenetic relationships between the taxa included [30],
with some deviations. In Figure 6, species of Stratiomyidae (family belonging to the suborder Orthorrhapha of
the order Diptera) form a separate cluster, as well as all
species of another suborder, Cyclorrhapha (the families
Drosophilidae, Agromyzidae, Tephritidae), with one
exception, Bactrocera oleae (Tephritidae). These two
branches were clustered together. Contrastingly, members of the “more primitive” suborder Nematocera
(Chironomidae, Culicidae) have the much lower similarity to other Diptera; formally, they were grouped with
the cluster (Lepidoptera + all other Diptera) and did not
form a separate cluster (Figure 6).
Interestingly, heat shock proteins (Hsp70) from both
Stratiomyidae species grouped with paralogous
sequences from several insect species including the ones
known to be highly thermotolerant such as Bombyx
mori [10], Locusta migratoria [31] and Drosophila mojavensis [29]. However, although even a few mammalian
Hsp70s were included into the tree, it is premature to
speculate on any functional relatedness of these proteins
because such speculation will require the inclusion and
analysis of many more sequences.

Discussion
In this paper we investigated the structure and general
arrangement of hsp70 genes from two Stratiomyidae
species from strikingly contrasting habitats.
According to field observations and measurements,
S. singularior has highly variable and instable larval habitats in the arid steppe zone of the Crimea. Strong
changes in the shore larval habitats of S. singularior were
observed since 2005 to 2009, both within the season and
between the years. These changes were related mostly to
hydrological regime, i.e. varying precipitation and the
water level of the lakes. Generally, in the periods of the
higher water table, many larval habitats were flooded or
strongly influenced by hypersaline lake water (mineralization reached 150 - 280‰ and higher). The decreasing
water level of the lake coincided with a decrease of
mineralization (up to 80 - 35‰ in some larval habitats);
in these periods, the respective habitats were moistened
mostly with groundwater of lower salinity. It should be
also mentioned that the abundance of S. singularior larvae varied greatly along the shoreline and between the
(micro)habitats. In favorable places, e.g. in some

Page 10 of 17

groundwater-fed pools above the lake water margin, the
larvae reached high abundance (hundreds and thousands
individuals per m2), but typically, they were completely
absent or found only as single individuals along the most
part of the shore.
It seems that in the study area, S. singularior is represented by a number of micropopulations mostly confined to some shore localities, which may be at a
distance of several km from each other. Many of these
favorable breeding places are temporary and completely
dry out in drier and warmer years. However, in this case
adult flies are able to cover the distance of several kilometers easily in search of new places for oviposition.
Therefore, our preliminary observations on the Crimean larval habitats of S. singularior testify to a variability
in the conditions between the habitats, strong variation
of conditions within the habitats occurring with time,
together with the temporary nature of many habitats
and their possible isolation from each other. All these
features may result in a high polymorphism of hsp70
demonstrated in this particular species.
We demonstrated a high level of polymorphism by
Southern blot hybridization with genomic DNA digests,
depending on the number of the larvae taken for analysis (Figure 2). Furthermore, sequencing of several phages
containing the same hsp70 genes revealed polymorphism
in the intergenic regions including long deletions. In a
few cases we detected deletions of entire individual
hsp70 genes (in phages 52, 33 and 51), likely a result of
unequal recombination.
These deletions may result from an evolutionary trend
to make the hsp70 cluster in this species more compact.
Previously we have described more compact organization of the hsp70 genes cluster in a more thermotolerant
low-latitude species Drosophila virilis in comparison
with the closely related higher-latitude D. lummei from
the temperate climatic zone [13] and, therefore, the
observed deletions may represent certain pattern. Alternatively, the deletions described in S. singularior may be
due to a high overall rate of DNA loss in this species, a
phenomenon previously demonstrated for two Drosophila species [32].
In contrast to the S. singularior biotope, the studied
larval habitat of O. pardalina - a cold spring near
St. Petersburg observed from 2004 to 2010 - was very
stable in mineralization, temperature, water regime, and
in other major conditions both within season and interannually. This spring and headwater stream seems to be
an island habitat for the O. pardalina population.
Another similar habitat is situated at about 3 km, and it
is unlikely that O. pardalina adults migrate regularly
between these localities. The abundance of larvae is not
high, not exceeding 10 - 50 individuals per m2 of semiaquatic shore substrate (moss etc.). Thus, habitats of the

two species differ dramatically from each other not only
in the average parameters such as temperature and
mineralization, but also in the spatial organization and
in the degree of variability in time.
Therefore, in the case of the latter species we have a
comparatively small and probably highly homozygous
population. Southern blot hybridization analysis (Figure 2)
did not reveal any polymorphisms in O. pardalina hsp70
genes and, hence, confirms this conclusion. Furthermore,
individual phages containing the same fragments of DNA
did not exhibit any polymorphisms either in coding or in
intergenic regions of the same hsp70 genes. Since these
phages were isolated from two independently obtained
genomic libraries they cannot contain the same DNA but
rather likely represent highly homologous sibs.
Previously, when we investigated inbred laboratory
strains of D. virilis and D. lummei, we also demonstrated apparent identity of the overlapping hsp70containing clones, which is typical for highly homozygous strains [13].
In spite of strikingly different habitats, the larvae of all
Stratiomyidae species studied have very high tolerance
to elevated temperature in comparison with most of
other Diptera species investigated [8]. Furthermore,
although tolerances were in general correlated with the
typical habitat temperatures of the species, even O. pardalina larvae inhabiting cold springs with constant temperature regime (5 - 10°C), significantly exceeded all
Drosophila species in tolerance and exhibited a huge
gap between the natural temperatures (5 - 10°C) and the
critical temperature (43°C).
Importantly, larvae of all four Stratiomyidae species
investigated have exhibited high constitutive levels of
Hsp70 proteins which are induced only 2 - 3-fold after
temperature elevation [8]. In this respect, Stratiomyidae
species resemble Locusta migratoria, an insect species
adapted to arid tropical and subtropical climate, where
temperature frequently exceeded 40°C [31].
Additionally, in contrast to Drosophila, the accumulation of Hsp70 continues in the cells of the treated larvae
of all Stratiomyidae species investigated for many hours
after heat shock and plateaus only approximately 24 36 h after the treatment [8].
The results obtained may be explained by constitutive
weak transcription (leakage) of hsp70 genes under normal physiological conditions, and possibly by comparatively higher stability of Hsps in Stratiomyidae species in
comparison with other insect species studied.
In order to further characterize the molecular basis
underlying this pattern of hsp70 expression and differences
in thermotolerance in the Stratiomyidae and other Diptera, as well as between the Stratiomyidae species, we
compared the general arrangement of hsp70 genes clusters
of the two Stratiomyidae species from thermally different

Page 12 of 17

habitats. Surprisingly, the analysis revealed quite different
organization of hsp70 genes in the two species compared.
Although the hsp70 copy number does not differ significantly between less tolerant O. pardalina and more
thermotolerant S. singularior, the general organization
of hsp70 genes is divergent in these two species. While
in S. singularior all hsp70 genes are confined to one
genomic section of about 29 kb in length, in O. pardalina most of hsp70 genes are scattered in the genome
and apparently located rather far from each other if
linked at all. However, in both species we have found
two hsp70 copies in an inverted orientation (a fundamental and probably ancient hsp70 gene unit) [22].
Furthermore, in O. pardalina we cloned a fragment carrying one copy of inducible hsp70 and one copy of presumptive hsp68 gene in tandem orientation separated by
only 3.5 kb.
Previously we described two hsp68 copies in inverted
orientation in species of the virilis group of Drosophila
[13]. We speculated that hsp68 in these species arose by
duplication of a basic unit of hsp70 genes typically
arranged in Diptera species in inverted orientation.
However, in the virilis group species hsp70 and hsp68
are located in the same chromosome but are separated
by a large distance [13]. Presumptive hsp68 gene of
O. pardalina is closely linked to hsp70 gene (Figure 1B)
and exhibits higher homology with hsp70 genes of this
species than with hsp68 genes from other Diptera species (data not shown). These data enable us to suggest
that O. pardalina hsp68 also represents a duplication of
hsp70 gene. At the present time we can not discriminate
between two hypotheses explaining the appearance of
hsp68. The appearance of the hsp68 by duplication of
hsp70 may occur very early in Diptera evolution and
predate the split of Drosophilidae and Stratiomyidae.
Alternatively hsp68 may appear independently in the
evolution of Drosophila and Stratiomyidae and acquire
similar functions and structure by convergence.
It is noteworthy that even for the genes located in
inverted orientation, which apparently represents the
primitive state of hsp70 in Diptera, the distance between
the inverted copies in O. pardalina is four times as
large as between the inverted copies in S. singularior
(Figure 1A and 1B).
The different spacing of hsp70 genes in the species
compared may resemble different abilities of their genome to efficiently respond to stress. The homogenized
coding sequences and highly compact organization of
hsp70s in S. singularior may be necessary for fast and
efficient transcriptional response and thereby thermotolerance of the larvae to extreme and rapidly changing
conditions of the environment.
On the other hand, O. pardalina inhabiting cold running waters with comparatively stable thermal

Garbuz et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:74
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/74

conditions may not require such tight hsp70 cluster
organization and, hence, underwent dispersal and pseudogenization of a few hsp70 copies in the process of
evolution. Two hsp70 pseudogenes detected in the genome of this species in our studies may represent the
remains of previously active genes. Previously we have
shown that larvae of O. pardalina produce significantly
less Hsp70 in response to heat shock in comparison
with all other Stratiomyidae species investigated [8]. The
observed drastic differences in the organization of hsp70
genes in S. singularior and O. pardalina may account
for the differences in the thermotolerance and Hsp70
levels after HS treatment observed between these
species.
Furthermore, HSE1 of O. pardalina is not canonical
and contains only two 5 bp units. Therefore, the first
canonical element (HSE2) in O. pardalina is located at
significantly larger distance from the transcription start
than in S. singularior (Figure 3). The differences in the
number of canonical HSEs and their spacing may also
contribute to different activity of hsp70 genes in the two
species [33] and explain why O. pardalina exhibits
lower thermotolerance in comparison with all other
Stratiomyidae species studied so far [8].
It is also evident from Figure 3 that in the case of
O. pardalina, the arrangement of promoter regions of
all hsp70 genes is practically identical, while in the case
of S. singularior the promoters of all members of hsp70
cluster differ significantly. These differences result from
fine tuning of an hsp70 “battery” necessary for adaptation of the latter species to highly variable environmental conditions. Therefore, our results indicate that
O. pardalina hsp70 genes may be locally adapted,
whereas higher hsp70 polymorphism may have important evolutionary consequences for S. singularior.
The evolution of hsp70 genes in the species compared is quite different in many respects. The MK
tests demonstrate that the divergence between individual S. singularior hsp70 genes is very low, especially
considering the age of the duplications. This is consistent with concerted evolution in this species, and also
strikingly different from the divergence between paralogs in O. pardalina (See Additional file 6: Table S1).
In all cases, the number of shared polymorphisms
between S. singularior hsp70 genes is highly unlikely to
have occurred via parallel mutation (Table 1). The presence of multiple conversion-mediated shared SNPs
and large conversion tracts in the alleles of the same
hsp70 members support gene conversion as a mechanism of concerted evolution (and thus sharing polymorphism) among duplicated hsp70 genes of
S. singularior species [34].
The overall pattern of conversion-mediated homogeneity among hsp70 genes in S. singularior that decays

Page 13 of 17

with distance from CDS, and polymorphic flanks that
contain large indels, is consistent with previously
described duplicated hsp70s in Drosophila [22]. We cannot exclude the occurrence of gene conversion in
O. pardalina, because in this species we did not isolate
multiple alleles of individual hsp70 genes. However,
since the level of fixed differences between hsp70 genes
in O. pardalina is several fold higher than in S. singularior (Additional file 6: Table S1), one may conclude that
in the former species the conversion process is less efficient if present at all. The large distances between individual hsp70 genes in O. pardalina genome likely
decrease the frequency of their conversion [35,36].
Whether the large distances also decrease their coordinate expression is an interesting question.
Several authors justly outlined many logical and statistical problems associated with using two-species
comparison for studying adaptations [37], and we are
well aware that unless similar correlation is obtained
for other Stratiomyidae species or geographical populations, any generalizations are premature. However, a
similar pattern of hsp70 organization has been previously described when studying two closely-related
species of the virilis group of Drosophila, which
replace one another along a latitudinal cline [14]. The
less thermotolerant high-latitude species D. lummei,
similar to O. pardalina, exhibits several-fold larger distance between tandemly arranged hsp70 copies in the
cluster, in comparison with the closely-related more
tolerant low-latitude D. virilis [14]. Interestingly, along
these lines one of the hsp70 copies described in
D. lummei was shown to be a nonfunctional pseudogene lacking the first 300 nucleotides of coding
sequence. Similarly, two likely nonfunctional pseudogenes have been described in the present study in the
less thermotolerant O. pardalina. Dispersed genomic
arrangement is not absolutely required for hsp70
degeneration. The tight hsp70 clusters of the tropical
island endemic D. mauritiana segregate multiple pseudogenes, although in this case a founder effect rather
than relaxation of selection may modulate hsp70 pseudogene frequencies [22]. In spite of the approximately
identical hsp70 copy number in Stratiomyidae and
Drosophila virilis group species, there are several clearcut differences in the organization and evolution of
hsp70 cluster between these phyla. In species of the
virilis group, not only the hsp70 transcriptional units
but also the 3’-flanking sequences are highly conserved
within D. virilis and between D. lummei and D. virilis.
Thus, the 3’-flanking sequence of several D. virilis
hsp70 genes is near identical for more than 1600 bp.
Such an arrangement suggests tandem duplication of
hsp70 copies by unequal crossing over in the course of
Drosophila species evolution [13].

Garbuz et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:74
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/74

In contrast, our analysis detected only short, varying
length regions of significant homology in the intergenic
regions in S. singularior hsp70 cluster. Similarly, we
detected only 650 bp of significant homology in the
intergenic regions located at the vicinity of 5’-ends of
hsp70 genes in O. pardalina.
At the present time, we can only speculate concerning
the molecular mechanisms which may underlie the different arrangement of hsp70 genes in the species studied,
although the pattern of compactness and conversion in
S. singularior vs. dispersion and divergence in O. pardalina is clear. Several large deletions in S. singularior,
including those spanning entire individual hsp70 genes,
may be indicative of an evolutionary trend towards compactness to provide a highly coordinate response to the
changing environmental conditions. The deletions may
also be a consequence of conversion; the more homogenized the individual hsp70 units, the more likely they are
also to participate in unequal crossover. On the other
hand, the dispersed arrangement and interlocus divergence of hsp70 copies in O. pardalina may result from
long-range recombination and relaxed selection on hsp70
sequences in a species living in very stable thermal
conditions.
The analysis of hsp70 arrangement in other species
and natural populations of Stratiomyidae and related
taxa (work in progress) should help to further evaluate
the evolution of hsp70 genes in the ecological context.

Conclusions
The evolution of hsp70 genes in the species compared is
quite different in many respects.
Although the hsp70 copy number does not differ significantly between less tolerant O. pardalina and more
thermotolerant S. singularior, the general organization
of hsp70 genes is divergent in these two species. While
in S. singularior all hsp70 genes are confined to one
genomic section of about 29 kb in length, in O. pardalina most of hsp70 genes are scattered in the genome
and apparently located rather far from each if linked at
all. However, in both species we have found two hsp70
copies in an inverted orientation, which represents a
fundamental and probably ancient hsp70 gene unit. The
divergence between individual S. singularior hsp70 genes
is very low, especially considering the age of the duplications. This is consistent with concerted evolution in this
species, and also strikingly different from the divergence
between paralogs in O. pardalina. The observed drastic
differences in the organization of hsp70 genes in
S. singularior and O. pardalina may contribute to the
differences in the thermotolerance between these species, and thus recapitulate the history of their thermal
adaptation.

Methods
Insects and habitats

In this study, we have investigated two stratiomyids, Stratiomys singularior Harris, 1776 and Oxycera pardalina
Meigen, 1822. Stratiomys singularior is a very common
and widely distributed Transpalaearctic species [38] whose
larvae develop in various shallow aquatic and semiaquatic
habitats of standing waters. For this study, S. singularoir
larvae were collected from the water margin zone of the
highly mineralized chloride coastal Lake Koyashskoe in
the Crimea. The measured temperature in the Crimean
habitat of S. singularior in May-August varies from 15 to
30°C, but apparently, it is much lower in winter and can
be significantly higher in summer. Water mineralization in
the S. singularior habitat varied from 35 to 280 g/L, and
could fluctuate around the highest values for weeks and
months. Oxycera pardalina is also widely distributed in
Western and Central Europe. The larvae of this species
are confined to clear-water cold carbonate springs and
streams [38]. The larvae were collected in the water margin zone of a spring near St. Petersburg characterized by a
year-round stable low water temperature (5 - 10°C). The
habitats of these populations and the techniques of sampling, identification and experiments have been described
in detail in a previous paper [8].
Preparation of RNA and cDNA synthesis

Total RNA from S. singularior larvae was prepared
by the standard method with TRIZOL (Invitrogen).
A cDNA library has been obtained from S. singularior
total RNA using MINT cDNA kit (Evrogen) according
to manufacturer’s manual.
Constructing and screening of cDNA library

Total double-stranded cDNA was cloned into the pALTA vector (Evrogen) using T4 DNA ligase (Promega).
E. coli DH5a strain competent cells were transformed
with ligation mix and inoculated onto LB agar Petri
dishes. After overnight incubation at 32°C, colonies were
transferred onto Hybond-N membranes (Amersham)
and in situ hybridization was performed as described
[39]. A full-size hsp70 gene of D. melanogaster was used
as a labeled probe to screen cDNA library.
5’- and 3’-RACE analysis

The MINT cDNA kit was used for the first strand cDNA
synthesis and amplification of 5’- and 3’-ends of cDNAs,
as described by the manufacturer. For 5’- and 3’-end
amplification outwards primers to 5’- and 3’-fragments of
S. singularior and O. pardalina hsp70 coding region were
used (See Additional file 15: Table S3 for primers used in
the study). PCR-fragments obtained were cloned into
pAL-TA vector (Evrogen) for sequencing.

2D electrophoresis and immunoblotting

Protein extraction and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis were performed as described by O’Farrell [40], with
slight modifications [41]. In brief, lysates were prepared
from larvae after exposure to various temperatures.
After 2D electrophoresis of 50 μg of total protein, the
proteins were transferred from gel into a nitrocellulose
membrane (Hybond ECL; Amersham) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. We used a monoclonal antibody specific to D. melanogaster inducible Hsp70 (antibody 7FB) and a monoclonal antibody which recognizes
all members of D. melanogaster Hsp70 family (antibody
7.10.3) including inducible Hsp70, Hsp68 and HSC70
(the antibodies were kind gift of Dr. Susan Lindquist,
Massachusetts Institute of Technology). Immune complexes were detected via chemoluminescence (ECL kit,
Amersham) with appropriate peroxidase-conjugated
anti-rat secondary antibodies (Millipore). Protein concentrations were normalized using BCA kit (Pierce)
according to manufacturer’s manual.
Genomic libraries construction, screening and clone
analyses

Genomic libraries from S. singularior and O. pardalina
were prepared by partial Sau3A digestion of genomic
DNA with subsequent ligation into the BamHI site of
lambda Dash phage arms (Stratagene). Before ligation,
restriction mixture was separated by ultracentrifugation
in sucrose gradient for removal of short restriction fragments, and resulting fraction contained fragments with
14 - 23 kb length used for cloning. Gradient parameters
were: 10 - 40% sucrose on 1 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl
pH 8.0 and 5 mM EDTA with ultracentrifugation at
26 000 g during 24 h. Ligated DNA was packaged into
phage particles using lambda packaging extracts (Stratagene). Recombinant phages were selected, amplified and
screened using E. coli XL-Blue MRA (P2) host strains.
For genomic libraries screening, S. singularior hsp70
full-length cDNA was used as a probe.
Isolated phages containing hsp70 genes were investigated by restriction analysis and hybridization, and subcloned into KS-Bluescript (pBluescript SK+) for
subsequent sequencing.
Southern blotting

Southern blot analysis of S. singularior and O. pardalina
genomic DNA was performed as described [39]. Five
micrograms of each DNA sample was digested with
restriction endonucleases. After agarose gel electrophoresis, each gel was treated for 15 min in 0.25 M HCl and
then incubated twice in denaturing buffer (1.5 M NaCl,
0.5 M NaOH) for 30 min. After 30 min incubation in
neutralization buffer (1.5 M NaCl, 0.5 M Tris-HCl pH
7.5), gels were capillary-blotted onto nylon membranes

Page 15 of 17

and fixed by UV cross-linking using the UV Stratalinker
2400 (Stratagene) protocol. Standard high-stringency
hybridization and wash conditions were used for Southern blot analysis. To detect hsp70 sequences in Southern
blots and genomic libraries, different EcoRI fragments of
cloned S. singularior hsp70 full-length cDNA (2340 nt
in length) were labeled by random priming and used as
probes.
The original screen of all libraries, individual recombinant clones analyses and Southern blots were performed
using S. singularior hsp70 full-length cDNA, while
Southern blots of O. pardalina genomic DNA were
probed with 1250 - 2340 bp PCR-fragment of coding
region of O. pardalina hsp70 gene.
PCR conditions and primers

To obtain S. singularior hsp70 intergenic regions, we
used primers outward from 5’- and 3’- hsp70 fragments.
To obtain the hsp70-hsp68 intergenic region of O. pardalina, we used primers outward from the 3’-end of hsp70
and 5’-flanking fragment of hsp68 gene. To obtain the
O. pardalina region located between hsp70 genes found
in inverse orientation, we used primer outward from the
5’-end of hsp70. For amplification of the O. pardalina
hsp70 coding region fragment used to probe Southern
blots, inward primers for 5’- and 3’-ends of the gene were
used (see Additional file 1, Table S3). PCR conditions
depended on primer annealing time and temperature. All
reactions contained 1.25 units of Encyclo DNA polymerase (Evrogen) per probe, 1.5 - 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM of
each dNTP, suitable quantity of DNA and 10 pM of each
primer in 50 μl (total volume).
Sequence analysis

Clones were sequenced with Sequenase (Amersham)
and ABI 377 sequencers. Sequences were assembled
manually and aligned using NCBI Blast and Vector NTI.
Relevant sequence information has been deposited in
GenBank. GenBank accessions numbers for hsp70
sequences are as following: S. singularior cDNA used as
a probe for genomic libraries screen, EU523048; S. singularior genomic contigs assembled basing on several
sequenced clones, HQ184404, HQ184405; O. pardalina
genomic contigs, HM141535, HM141536, HM141537,
HM141538, HM141539.
Whenever possible, hsp70 sequences were divided by
eye into four segments: coding sequence ("CDS”), 5’and 3’-untranslated regions ("UTRs”), and upstream promoter regions. The 5’-UTR was delineated by the TATA
signal and last bases upstream of the start codon. The
3’-UTR was extended from the first bases downstream
of the stop codon through the polyadenylation signal
when possible. The promoter region was approximated
as 400 - 600 bp upstream of the TATA signal.

Sequences were aligned using CLUSTALX [42],
trimmed to eliminate end gaps, and unalignable sequences
were removed (i.e., sequences containing large indels or
rearrangements, see below). BLAST (http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/BLAST) was utilized to assess identity of repetitive
sequences around indels and rearrangements. Sequences
were grouped across genes when they shared high homology (e.g. CDS, 5’-UTRs) or within genes when they
diverged (e.g. most 3’-UTRs). After realignment of the
trimmed, grouped sequences, custom perl scripts (available upon request) parsed alignments to generate figures
and tally substitutions. For phylogenetic analysis, neighborjoining tree building and 1000 bootstrap trials were conducted using CLUSTALX, MEGA [43] and Vector-NTI.
Analysis of polymorphism and divergence was conducted using DNASP [44]. Testing the probability of
shared polymorphisms arising via gene conversion vs.
independent mutation utilized the approximation of the
hypergeometric distribution (implemented in DNASP;
method described in [26]).
