Abstract
Background: During the past decade, Chorioptes mites occupying the outer ear canals have been a
common finding at routine necropsies of moose (Alces alces) in Sweden, but neither the taxonomy of the
mites nor lesions from the infestation have been investigated. In this study, the mites are characterized by
morphological and molecular techniques, and the histopathology of the skin of the outer ear canal is
described.
Methods: External auditory meatuses from 53 necropsied moose were examined for the presence of
Chorioptes, and samples from outer ear canals were taken for histopathological and microbiological
examination. A proportion of the mites from each moose was identified to species. The DNA was
extracted from mites from three moose, and their ITS-2 sequences were determined; these sequences
were compared phylogenetically to sequences from other Chorioptes taxa.
Results: Chorioptes mites were found in 43 (81%) of the 53 moose. The mites had morphological and
genetic characteristics distinct from those of C. texanus and C. bovis, the two species generally accepted
within the genus. Morphology also did not argue for a diagnosis as C. crewei, C. mydaus or C. panda. On
histopathology, lesions were characterized by a hyperplastic perivascular to interstitial dermatitis with
epidermal hyperkeratosis and crust formation. Dermal inflammatory infiltrates were composed of mixed
T- and B-lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages, whereas eosinophils were notably uncommon.
Staphylococcus aureus was grown from the infested epidermis of five of 14 examined moose.
Conclusion: Chorioptes mite infestation was frequently detected in the outer ear canals of moose in
Sweden. The mites were evidently pathogenic, being associated with inflammatory lesions of the external
auditory meatus. Our studies indicate infestations with a previously undescribed Chorioptes species.

Background

Methods

Ectoparasites of the genus Chorioptes (Acari: Psoroptidae)
are distributed worldwide, infesting domestic as well as
wild herbivores [1,2]. These non-burrowing mites are
commonly found on cattle, sheep, goats, horses and the
New World camelids, where they are a common cause of
mange and have considerable veterinary importance. The
affected skin areas vary with host and degree of infestation, but the extremities or tail regions are commonly
involved. The entire life cycle, from egg-laying through
larval and nymphal stages to mature mites, takes place on
the same host, and spans approximately three weeks [3].

Source of material
Moose found dead or shot in the field were submitted to
SVA during the period 1997 and 2000–2006, and examined as part of a health monitoring programme. External
auditory meatuses from 53 necropsied moose, sampled at
convenience, were examined for the presence of Chorioptes
spp. The degree of post-mortem change in the carcases
ranged from mild to marked. Forty-three of the moose
originated from seven counties in central Sweden (Stockholm, Uppsala, Sörmland, Örebro, Västmanland, Dalarna
and Gävleborg), and 10 from more southerly regions (the
counties of Östergötland, Kalmar, Skåne, Halland and
Älvsborg). The nutritional state was judged to be normal,
subnormal or cachectic (with serous atrophy of fat). The
age of the moose was estimated by cementum ageing analysis [17]; and the sex was recorded in 50 animals.

At present, the taxonomy of Chorioptes is unclear. Two species, Chorioptes bovis (Hering, 1845) and Chorioptes texanus
Hirst 1924 are generally accepted [1,4], based on morphology and genetic differentiation, while the existence of
three further species, Chorioptes crewei Lavoipierre 1958,
Chorioptes mydaus Fain 1975 and Chorioptes panda Fain
and Leclerc 1975, is still questionable [2,5]. Both C. bovis
and C. texanus are ubiquitous mites with a low degree of
host specificity. These mites are mostly found to infest the
skin surface of the body, and are rarely found in the ears
of the hosts [4,6]. One exception is reindeer (Rangifer
tarandus), in which C. texanus has been considered to be a
primarily auricular mite [7]. C. texanus has also been isolated from cattle (Bos taurus), goats (Capra hircus), roe deer
(Capreolus capreolus), sika deer (Cervus nippon) and moose
(Alces alces) [1,5,8-13]. Reported hosts of C. bovis include
wild and domestic Bovidae, Cervidae, Equidae and
Camelidae [4].
Moose are widely distributed and inhabit almost all rural
parts of Sweden. The population amounts to approximately 300,000 during summertime, but is reduced to
about 200,000 by hunting in fall [14]. Compilation of
diagnoses at routine necropsies at the National Veterinary
Institute (SVA) 1986–91 showed various diseases in the
Swedish moose population. Among the most frequent
diagnoses were traumatic injury, microbial infectious disease, elaphostrongylosis and tumours [15].
Otoacariasis caused by Chorioptes was confirmed to occur
frequently in Swedish moose found dead or shot in the
field and examined at SVA during the last decade [16].
Preliminary studies on the mite indicated a hitherto undescribed taxon of Chorioptes. To the best of our knowledge
the lesions associated with Chorioptes infestation in moose
have not been reported. In the present study, the morphological and molecular characteristics of the mite are
reported, and the pathology of the infestation in the outer
ear canal of moose is described.

Both outer ear canals of each moose were investigated.
The ears with their attached earflaps were cut away as close
to the scalp as possible. The ear canals were dissected from
attached tissues, and a segment 2–4 cm long of the inner
part of the canals was removed. All moose were subjected
to parasitological examination, while 28 and 14 were subjected to histopathological and microbiological examination, respectively. No examination for mites was
performed on the skin and fur of other body sites.
Parasitological examination
The ear-canal samples were cut open, exposed to 25–27°C
for 30 min, after which the inner surface of the canals was
examined under a stereomicroscope. If no mites were
observed, skin scrapings were obtained and treated with
10% KOH for 5 hours. After centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded, and a few drops of glycerin were added
to the sediment, which was then searched for mites. A proportion of the mites from each moose was identified to
species. In 32 moose the level of infestation with mites
was subjectively scored: low (n = ≤10), mild (n = >10 –
≤50), moderate (n = >50 – ≤500), or high (n = >500).
When degrees of infestation differed between the ears, the
scoring was based on the most heavily infested ear, and
moose with one ear negative and the other positive were
scored according to the positive ear.
Morphological investigations of mites
Diagnosis of the mites to genus was made according to
Fain [18], while Chorioptes species differentiation was
based on a key given by Fain and Leclerc [19]. Opisthosomal seta 1, 2 and 3 located at the opisthosomal lobes, and
seta 4 originating from the caudal body margin between
the opisthosomal lobe and leg 4, as well as seta 5 located
at tarsus III, were measured in up to 20 male mites isolated from three moose (seta numbering according to
Sweatman [7]). For comparison, these setae were also

als within a representative skin scraping, and the frequency of polymerase errors and rare polymorphisms, ten
clones generated in ten PCR reactions from DNA obtained
from moose M290 were sequenced. In the sequences
obtained from the other skin scrapings, mutations at sites
that had not previously been demonstrated to be polymorphic were verified by at least one other clone originating from an independent PCR amplification.

measured in up to 40 male C. texanus mites collected from
cattle in Germany. Statistical comparisons were done
using the Student's t-test.
DNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction and
sequencing
Up to 25 mg of each skin scraping from three moose
(M289, M290 and M291) was frozen in liquid nitrogen
and grounded to a fine powder. DNA was then extracted
using the QIAamp DNA mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the instructions of the manufacturer,
and eluted in 50 μl elution buffer. Primers RIB-4 (CCA
TCG ATG TGA A(C,T)T GCA GGA CA) and RIB-3 (CGG
GAT CCT TC(A,G) CTC GCC G(C,T)T ACT) were originally designed for the amplification of the second internal
transcribed spacer (ITS-2) of the rDNA from Dermacentor
ticks [20]. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifications, as well as cloning and sequencing, were done with
5 μl of the DNA solution as described elsewhere [5].
Molecular sequence analysis
Consensus ITS-2 sequences, here called genotypes, were
constructed manually by comparing alignments obtained
using the Clustal W (version 1.83) algorithm [21]. Mutations at a given position occurring in only a single clone
were classified as polymerase errors, or (indistinguishable
from them) as rare genotypes, and were not included in
the genotype sequence. Mutation rates were calculated by
counting substitutions, deletions and insertions as one
mutation each, and dividing the sum by the average
length of the sequences. Identities were determined as differences between 100% and the respective mutation rate.
To estimate genetic variation between different individu-

For comparison, representative ITS-2 sequences obtained
from C. texanus and C. bovis using the same PCR protocol
and cloning strategies [5] were included in the analysis
[EMBL:EF191362, EMBL:EF191363, EMBL:EF191364,
EMBL:EF191369, EMBL:EF191372, EMBL:EF191375], as
well as other Chorioptes ITS-2 database sequences
[EMBL:AF123081, EMBL:AF123082, EMBL:AF123084,
EMBL:EF053119, EMBL:EF053120, EMBL:EF053122,
EMBL:EF053123]. Sequences from two other members of
the Psoroptidae, Otodectes cynotis [EMBL:AF367699] and
Psoroptes [EMBL:EF429269], were used as the outgroup.
The initial multiple sequence alignment was produced
using Clustal W, and then manually modified so that it
was consistent with the mite ITS-2 secondary-structure
model [22]. The fit of the sequences to this model was
assessed using the MFold (version 3.2) program [23]. The
final alignment had 309 positions for the ITS-2 region of
287 bp (bases 45–331 of [EMBL:EF433564]).
Phylogenetic trees were produced via both maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood algorithms, using the
PAUP* (version 4.0b10) package [24]. Maximum-parsimony heuristic searches used 100 random-addition
sequences of TBR branch swapping, as well as 20 replications of the parsimony ratchet [25] based on 200 iterations of TBR branch swapping. Maximum-likelihood
heuristic searches used the ratchet (Nixon) [26] strategy
based on 100 iterations of TBR branch swapping. The
GTR+G substitution model was used, determined after
preliminary testing with the ModelTest program [27], and
the parameter values (fixed during the searches) were estimated using successive approximations [28].
Support for the phylogenies was measured by bootstrapping. For the maximum-parsimony analyses this was
based on 2,000 pseudoreplicates, each with 100 randomaddition sequences of TBR branch swapping, while for
maximum-likelihood analyses it was based on 200 pseudoreplicates, each with 10 random-addition sequences of
TBR branch swapping.
Histopathological examination
Pieces of the sampled inner ear canals were fixed in 10%
neutral buffered formaldehyde, embedded in paraffin,
and routinely processed for histopathology. Sections cut 4

μm thick were routinely stained with haematoxylin and
eosin (HE), and selected sections were stained with periodic acid Schiff (PAS) for aid in identification of parasites,
Grocott for fungi, Gram's stain for bacteria, toluidine blue
for mast cells, and Lendrum's method for eosinophils
[29]. For further characterization of inflammatory cells,
skin specimens from five moose were investigated for
lymphocyte subsets, employing monoclonal mouse antihuman antibodies CD3 F7.2.38 (Dakocytomation, Glostrup, Denmark) and CD79αcy (Dakocytomation, Glostrup, Denmark) for T-cells and B-cells respectively, in the
Dako EnVision +® system.
Microbiological examination
Smears from pieces of the sampled inner ear canals were
plated onto Blood Agar Base (Difco) with 5% horse blood
and Blue-agar Base with 1% glucose for bacteriological
culture. The plates were incubated at 37°C, and inspected
for growth after 24 and 48 hours. For mycological examination, the smears were plated onto 2% Sabouraud glucose agar (Difco) with chloramphenicol. The plates were
incubated in an aerobic environment at 27°C, and
inspected for a period of 10 days. Isolated strains were
recultured, and identified by morphological and physiological characteristics according to standard methods.

IV, a single long seta at tarsus of legs III, as well as with legs
III about twice as long as legs IV (Figure 1 and 2A). The
opisthosomal lobes were as long as wide, and bore five
setae. Three long and strong setae (setae l4, l5 and d5
according to Fain [18]; seta l5 corresponds to seta 2 in figure 2B and table 1) arose, very close to each other, from
the apical margin of the lobe. Two of these setae, l4 and
d5, were flattened and blade-like at their apical thirds,
while seta l5 (seta 2) did not increase in width apically. A
fourth seta (seta 1 according to Sweatman [7]; seta ae
according to Fain [18]) was shorter than the three setae
mentioned above, and arose latero-apically at a small
accessory lobe forming a small angle with relation to the
main lobe. This seta was separated by a distinct gap from
the group of the three other setae (Figure 2). The fifth
opisthosomal seta was very short and fine. It was found at
the medial side of the lobe and arose dorsally.
Within Chorioptes, the mites detected in moose in Sweden were found to have more or less quadrangular
opisthosomal lobes, and outer opisthosomal setae ae
(seta 1) distinctly shorter than setae l4, l5 (seta 2) and d5,
which arose as a group close to each other (Figure 2). They
were therefore clearly different from both C. bovis and C.
crewei, and more similar to descriptions of mites C. texanus, C. mydaus and C. panda.

Results
Infested moose were found in all parts of the study area,
covering the mid and south regions of Sweden. Of the 53
moose examined parasitologically, 43 (81%) were
infested with Chorioptes sp. Five of those only had one ear
infested. The degree of infestation was scored in 32
moose, in 7 it was low, in 8 mild, in 11 moderate and in
6 moose it was high. Twenty-eight moose had similar
degrees of infestation in both ears, while in two moose the
degree of infestation between ears varied, and two had
only one ear infested.
Of the infested moose, 33 were females and eight were
males, whereas the sex was not recorded in two animals.
Nine moose showed a subnormal nutritional state, and
21 were cachectic. The 10 non-infested moose included
six females, three males and one with the sex not
recorded. Four of them had a subnormal nutritional state,
and two were cachectic. The age distribution of both
infested and non-infested moose ranged from calves to 23
years. As judged from post-mortem records, the panorama
of necropsy diagnoses did not differ between infested and
non-infested animals, and was similar to that found in the
material of Swedish moose necropsied at SVA 1986–1991
[15].
Morphology of mites
The mites were identified as Chorioptes, based on males
with short pedicles and caruncles (suckers) at legs III and

In comparison to male C. texanus isolated from cattle in
Germany, the male Chorioptes from Swedish moose possessed longer opisthosomal setae 1 (seta ae), 2 (seta l5)

cantly in length (table 1). The differences were most evident in seta 1 being 85 μm long on average in the mites
from moose, compared to an average length of 54 μm in
the C. texanus mites. This seta was also thicker in the mites
from moose than in C. texanus (Figure 2). Additionally,
the accessory opisthosomal lobe bearing seta 1 seemed to
be smaller and proximally positioned in the mites from
the moose (Figure 2).
Molecular investigations
DNA sequences between primers RIB-3 and RIB-4, varying
in length between 388 and 390 bp, were determined from
ten clones originating from independent PCR amplifications using DNA extracted from skin scraping materials of
moose M290. Taq polymerase errors and rare polymorphisms (which are indistinguishable), determined as individual mutations not found in any other sequenced clone,
were detected at seven positions (six substitutions and

one 1-base deletion) in seven of the ten clones, corresponding to a rate of 0.2%.
After excluding Taq polymerase errors and rare polymorphisms from further analysis, nine polymorphic positions, including seven substitutions as well as one 1-base
and one 2-base insertion/deletion, were detected, resulting in eight different sequence types here called genotypes. Seven genotypes were found in the ten sequences of
mites from moose M290, while two and three genotypes
were obtained from mites collected from moose M289
and M291, respectively. Genotype 1 was the genotype
detected most frequently, being found five times and in
mites from all the three host animals. Genotype 2
included three sequences from moose M290 and M291,
while two sequences were affiliated to genotype 3 from
moose M289 and M290. All of the other genotypes were
detected only once. The identities between the different
genotypes varied from 97.5–99.7%. The sequences are

(Figure 4). In the superficial dermis were scattered T- and
B-lymphocytes, plasma cells and occasional mast cells.

available under the database accession numbers [GenBank:EF433564–EF433575].
The phylogenetic analyses produced a single maximumlikelihood tree (Figure 3) and 404 maximum-parsimony
trees. The majority-rule consensus of the maximum-parsimony trees differed from the maximum-likelihood tree
only in being less resolved; and the bootstrap support for
the relevant branches was also approximately the same.
The sequences of the Chorioptes mites from the moose
formed a distinct monophyletic group in these trees, with
a sister-group relationship to C. texanus. The support for
the C. bovis group was poor, due to ambiguous support for
the inclusion or exclusion of both genotype 2 and the
Chorioptes taxon sampled from panda.
Histopathology
In ears negative for Chorioptes, the epidermis consisted of
2–4 layers of epithelial cells. Over a single straight layer of
basal cells were one or two layers of spinosum cells,
mostly followed by one layer of granular cells. The thickness of the stratum corneum was somewhat variable, and

In ears with mites, the epidermis was in general moderately, and sometimes severely, hyperplastic. Mixed
orthokeratotic and parakeratotic hyperkeratosis was a frequent feature, and in nine cases serocellular exudation
with degenerated neutrophils and crust formation was
seen (Figures 5A and 5B). Mild to moderate exocytosis of
neutrophils into the epidermis occurred in seven cases. In
13 moose, intact mites or mite fragments were lying free
on the surface among keratin fragments, or embedded in
crusts (Figure 5C). Some cases showed mild to moderate
spongiosis, and occasional vacuolated keratinocytes were
found in the spinous and granular strata. Six moose had
ulcerations in one or both ears, generally shallow, but
occasionally deep. In four moose, ulcerations were acute,
with neutrophil-rich serocellular exudates, and sometimes haemorrhages, whereas two moose showed chronic
ulcers with fibrosis. In the dermis, mostly mild to moderate, but occasionally severe, perivascular to interstitial
inflammatory infiltrates occurred consistently (Figures 5D
and 5E). Superficial to mid-dermal infiltrates were as a
rule dominated by T-cells and plasma cells, with an
admixture of macrophages (not further characterized)
and, in six moose, sparse eosinophils. Compared to noninfested ears, any increase of mast cells was not evident.
Where inflammation extended to the deep dermis, the
infiltrate was mainly perivascular and plasmacellular.
Mild to moderate vascular congestion was common. Both
ceruminal and sebaceous glands often showed mild to
moderate hypertrophy, with the addition of moderate
hyperplasia in ceruminal glands. All sections stained for
fungi were negative. Small amounts of bacteria (grampositive cocci) were found superficially on the skin surface
or in crusts in a few ears.
Microbiology
Among the 14 moose subjected to bacterial cultivation,
Staphylococcus aureus was grown from five and Staphylococcus spp. from one moose, all mite-infested. Of the eight
moose negative for bacterial culture, four were miteinfested. Yeasts, not further characterized, were cultured
from two moose, both non-infested.

Discussion
This study showed that Chorioptes sp. was frequently
detected in the outer ear canals of moose (Alces alces) in
Sweden. In wildlife, localization of Chorioptes mites in the
outer ear canals has also been described in reindeer, Rangifer tarandus [7], red-flanked duiker, Cephalophus rufilatus
[30] and giant panda, Ailuropoda melanoleuca [19]. In this
study the skin of other parts of the body of the moose was
not examined for mites and therefore it is not known if

for direct morphological and molecular comparison.

the Chorioptes infestation was restricted to the ear canals.
Moreover, Chorioptes sp. have been found on alopecic
areas of the skin in moose necropsied at SVA, and in one
case Chorioptes were also demonstrated in the outer ear
canals (pers. comm. C. Bröjer). However, these mites have
not yet been closely compared to the Chorioptes sp. isolated from the external ear canals of the moose of this
study.
The evidence presented here indicates that the Chorioptes
sp. found is a previously undescribed species, which will
be described in detail in a later publication. The Chorioptes
sp. was closest to C. texanus, based on both morphology
and genetics including cloning and sequencing of multiple independent PCR products from skin scrapings, in
order to recognize different sequence types that might
originate from different individual mites present in the
skin, or from different copies of the rDNA which represents a multi-copy gene [5].
Morphological differentiation between C. texanus and C.
bovis is mainly based on the setae at the opisthosomal
lobes in male mites (Figure 2). The outer opisthosomal
seta, called seta 1 [4] or seta ae [18], is much longer in C.
bovis than in C. texanus, with a length >100 μm and <100
μm, respectively [5,7,31]. The mites from moose possessed shorter setae than those of C. bovis. Furthermore,
they had longer opisthosomal setae 1, 2 and 3 compared
to C. texanus mites from cattle. Whether the ear mites of
reindeer, affiliated to C. texanus [7], might actually belong
to the same species as the ear mites from moose of this

When the genotype sequences from the Chorioptes mites
from moose were compared with sequences from C. texanus and C. bovis obtained using the same protocols [5],
pairwise identities from the different Chorioptes moose
genotypes were 89–91% (C. texanus) and 86–89% (C.
bovis). These inter-species identities were thus of the same
order as the identity of 89–93% found between C. texanus
and C. bovis [5], for which separate species status is generally accepted. Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses (which
were robust to the form of analysis used) indicated that
the moose mites formed a monophyletic group, with a sister-group relationship to C. texanus. This separation is
interpreted here as an indication of taxonomic separation
and not as a reflection of the geographic origin of the
mites, because the corresponding sequences of C. texanus
and C. bovis grouped according to taxonomic entities and
not the geographical origin of the mites, and the mites
from Swedish moose did not group together with Chorioptes mites of their nearest geographical origin. Thus, there
is no molecular support, either from genetic similarity or
sister-group relationships, for placing the Chorioptes mites
from Swedish moose in either C. texanus or C. bovis.
In the past, moose have been described as being parasitized by C. texanus in Poland [11,12], although neither pictures nor descriptions of the mites were given. These mites
might be different from those that we found in moose in
Sweden, because the mites in Poland were not found in
the auricles of the animals but only at several other body
sites [12]. We did not investigate non-auricular body sites
in our study, leaving open the question as to whether
other species of Chorioptes, such as C. texanus, are also
found in moose in Sweden or if the Chorioptes sp. identified in this study affects other parts of the skin besides the
ear canal.
The species status of the other three Chorioptes species
seems doubtful [2]. C. crewei was based on morphological
features of only four females and two males taken from
the ears of a red-flanked duiker (Cephalophus rufilatus) in
Cameroon [30,32], and detection of this species has never
been documented afterwards. Mites of C. mydaus were isolated only once from a stink badger (Mydaus lucifer) in
Borneo [18], and those of C. panda were found in the ears
of giant pandas (Ailuropoda melangolenca) in zoos in
France [19] and China [33]. Affiliation of the mites from
Swedish moose with C. mydaus or C. panda was difficult to
determine, since mites of these questionable species were
not available for direct comparison. Morphological comparison was thus limited to published descriptions and
drawings [18,19,33], which allowed only limited conclusions. The mites from the moose differed from C. mydaus

Histopathology of the skin from the outer ear canal in a Chorioptes-infested moose
Figure 5
Histopathology of the skin from the outer ear canal in a Chorioptes-infested moose. A: Marked epidermal hyperplasia with prominent rete ridges (acanthosis) and orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis. HE. B: Acanthotic epidermis with multifocal
crust formation (arrows) and mixed inflammation in dermis. HE. C: Haemorrhagic crust with embedded cross-sectioned mite
(arrow), on epidermis. HE. D: Dermal inflammation, showing lymphocytes, plasma cells and some macrophages with a perivascular to interstitial distribution. HE. E: Immunohistochemistry for CD3 F7.2.38 (T-lymphocytes stained brown), showing

by a shorter seta ae, which was 85 μm on average compared to 100 μm in C. mydaus [18]. Additionally, setae l4
and d5 were of a distinct flattened, blade-like shape in the
mites from moose (Figure 2), while they were described
and drawn to be small or only slightly widened in C.
mydaus [18]. The moose mites were regarded as morphologically closer to C. panda based on drawings [19]. The
most evident differences were that in C. panda seta ae was
less separated by setae l4, l5 and d5, and all of these 4 setae
arose at an oblique line from the opisthosomal lobe [19],
while there was a distinct gap between seta ae and the
other three seta mentioned in the mites from the moose,
and the seta ae arose proximal to a line of the points of origin of setae l4, l5 and d5 (Figure 2). These differences,

however, could not be detected in the drawings of C.
panda by other authors [33].
No evidence was found to affiliate the Chorioptes sp. with
any of these taxa. The sequence from mites sampled from
panda in China [EMBL:EF053123], although not affiliated to a particular mite species, appears to exclude C.
panda as a possible identification of the moose mite.
A high percentage of the moose (~81%) was shown to be
Chorioptes-infested. Additionally the true prevalence of
infestation might actually have been higher since in many
cases the moose had been dead for several days, and the
mites may had left the carcase. The direct ocular method

employed, i.e. raising the temperature of the sampled
pieces of ear canals, stimulated the live mites to migrate
and thus facilitated their detection and collection. This
method is able to detect live mites that are present in relatively high numbers. Detection of mites by skin scrapings, also performed in this study, is more frequently used
[34], and demonstrates only a proportion of the mites
actually present. Also, it does not distinguish live from
dead mites. In addition, non-burrowing mites may occasionally be found in histological sections, however, most
of the mites on the skin surface may be lost during the histological processing.
The majority of the moose were in a poor nutritional state,
ranging from subnormal to cachectic. Mite-infested animals were more often recorded at necropsy as cachectic
than were uninfested moose. However, possible associations between Chorioptes infestation and the nutritional
state and other factors, including age, sex, season and concomitant diseases, were not analyzed because the sample
was obtained from animals found dead in the field at different times of the year and sent for diagnostic post-mortem examination. This resulted in a great variability in
host related factors and possible biases in sampling.
Since the samples were from wild animals, no observations on the duration of the infestations could be performed. The histopathological changes, however,
suggested that most cases were subacute or chronic. Studies describing the pathology of chorioptic mange in various species, including ruminants, are few, and only
concern mange caused by C. bovis. The epidermal changes
seen in the moose, characterized by hyperplasia with
ortho- and parakeratotic hyperkeratosis, sometimes with
serocellular exudates and crusts, were similar to those
described in sheep and a Japanese serow (Capricornis crispus) [35,36].
Eosinophils are common in allergic reactions, including
those of ectoparasitic origin [37-39]. The inconsistent and
sparse dermal tissue eosinophilia in the moose is in contrast to findings in C. bovis-infested cattle and horses, in
which eosinophils were numerous [37,40], but are in
accordance with observations in sheep with this mite [35].
In dermal allergic hypersensitivity reactions in domestic
animals, a superficial perivascular distribution of inflammatory cells is commonly predominant [37,38]. Despite
the type of hypersensitivity reaction, T-lymphocytes dominate, while B-lymphocytes and plasma cells are present in
lesser amounts [38,39]. The dermal inflammation in the
moose was characterized by perivascular to interstitial
infiltrates of T-lymphocytes, plasma cells and B-lymphocytes, suggesting that also in the moose the reactivity
may involve a hypersensitivity reaction. In C. bovis-

http://www.actavetscand.com/content/49/1/21

infested sheep, macrophages, lymphocytes and plasma
cells were found perivascularly in the superficial dermis,
and the reaction was proposed to represent an allergic
contact dermatitis [35].
Dermal infiltrates of plasma cells were prominent in the
moose. Plasma cells are reported to be common in interstitial dermatitis in large domestic animals, and may be
considered to be of low significance [37]. However, in
dogs and cats, plasma cells are described as predominant
in late stage pyoderma, but are less frequent in allergic
hypersensitivity reactions [38]. A bacterial cause of the
prominent plasma cell infiltration in the moose should be
considered, because staphylococci, mainly Staphylococcus
aureus, were cultured from the moose's ear skin in 6/10
infested ears, but in none of the non-infested moose.
Nonetheless, in many species S. aureus belongs to the normal skin flora [41], and this could also be the case in the
skin of the outer ear canals of moose. Irrespective if the
ears were cultured positive for staphylococci or not, dermal infiltrates of plasma cells were a feature. Hence, an
association between presence of plasma cells and positive
culture could not be established. This might indicate
another cause than bacterial infection to the plasma cell
prominence.

Conclusion
Chorioptes sp. was frequently detected in the outer ear
canals of moose (Alces alces) in Sweden. This mite has
morphological and genetic characteristics distinct from
those of C. texanus and C. bovis, the two species generally
accepted within the genus. Morphology also did not unequivocally argue for a diagnosis as C. crewei, C. mydaus or
C. panda, and thus we argue that the mites belong to a proposed new species. The mites were obviously pathogenic
to the moose, evoking epidermal and dermal inflammatory lesions, the latter indicating immunological hypersensitivity reactions.
