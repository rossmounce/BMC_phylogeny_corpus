Abstract
Background: Recombination between strains of HIV-1 only occurs in individuals with multiple
infections, and the incidence of recombinant forms implies that multiple infection is common. Most
direct studies indicate that multiple infection is rare. We determined the rate of multiple infection
in a longitudinal study of 58 HIV-1 positive participants from The Women's Interagency HIV Study
with a richer sampling design than previous direct studies, and we investigated the role of
recombination and sampling design on estimating the multiple infection rate.
Results: 40% of our sample had multiple HIV-1 infections. This rate of multiple infection is
statistically consistent with previous studies once differences in sampling design are taken into
account. Injection drug use significantly increased the incidence of multiple infections. In general
there was rapid elimination of secondary strains to undetectable levels, but in 3 cases a
superinfecting strain displaced the initial infecting strain and in two cases the strains coexisted
throughout the study. All but one secondary strain was detected as an inter- and/or intra-genic
recombinant. Injection drug use significantly increased the rate of observed recombinants.
Conclusion: Our multiple infection rate is consistent with rates estimated from the frequency of
recombinant forms of HIV-1. The fact that our results are also consistent with previous direct
studies that had reported a much lower rate illustrates the critical role of sampling design in
estimating this rate. Multiple infection and recombination significantly add to the genetic diversity
of HIV-1 and its evolutionary potential, and injection drug use significantly increases both.

Background
Much recombination between HIV-1 subtypes has been
documented [1,2]. Recombination in HIV requires infection with more than one virus at the cellular level within
a single host. Jung et al. [3] reported an average of three to
four distinct proviral genomes within infected spleen
cells, which implies that the potential for recombination
in HIV-1 is large. The documented recombination
between subtypes further implies that HIV-1 infected individuals must have had multiple infections; that is, the
same individual was infected by two or more strains of
HIV-1 that overlapped temporally. An HIV-1 strain is a
monophyletic group that is genetically differentiated from
other such groups by fixed, diagnostic genetic differences.
Individuals infected with two or more subtypes have been
documented [4,5], thus the potential for inter-subtype
recombination exists. Individuals infected with two or
more strains of the same subtype have also been documented [6,7]. Taylor and Korber [8] estimated the incidence of multiple infections from detected intra-subtype
recombinants as being up to 15% of all HIV-1 infections
in some populations. Multiple infection rates calculated
from observed inter- or intra-subtype recombinants, however, are estimates of the cumulative multiple infection
rates over the evolutionary history of the viral strains
involved [8], and this in turn can be influenced by factors
other than recombination. For example, the only recombinants that can be observed in this type of analysis are
those that have had some persistence over evolutionary
time. If selection either favors or acts against multiple
infection recombinants, the estimated multiple infection
rates will be accordingly biased. Therefore, one must characterize a population of infected individuals directly to
truly assess the rate and dynamics of multiple infection
[8].
Previous studies on populations of infected individuals
have indicated a low rate of multiple infection, ranging
from 0% to 14% [9-14]. These studies vary tremendously
in sample design, with sample sizes varying from 7
infected individuals to 718, with different numbers of
HIV-1 samples being taken per individual, with different
amounts and locations of the HIV-1 genome being surveyed genetically, and with some studies being a single
cross-section of infected individuals and others longitudinal. Overall, these studies indicate a multiple infection
incidence of 0.8% when weighted by sample size, a figure
heavily influenced by one study [10], for which it was concluded that there was no evidence for multiple infection
in 718 individuals. In those studies that distinguish
between coinfection (the host was initially infected by
two or more strains of HIV-1) and superinfection (an initial infection was followed by a later secondary infection),
equal rates of 1.6% for coinfection and superinfection
yield an overall rate of multiple infection of 3.2%. These

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/6/1/54

results are an order of magnitude below the indirect estimates based on recombination analyses [1,8]. Indeed, the
incidences of multiple infection were so low in some of
these studies, that the authors speculated that some
degree of protection may be generated against superinfection [11,13,14].
In this study we examine a longitudinal cohort of HIV-1
positive women coupled with genetic screens of the pol
and env genes of HIV-1. To enhance power to detect coinfection and superinfection beyond that of the previous
studies mentioned above, we executed a fully prospective
longitudinal study on 58 participants, the largest sample
with such a design. We examined all participants for both
the env and pol genes and more sequences per visit than
previous studies. From these data, we estimated the incidence of multiple infection and the impact of the risk factor of injection drug use (IDU) on multiple infection by
including both IDUs and non-IDUs in our sample. We
also investigated the temporal dynamics of superinfection
and its evolutionary significance.
Because the phenomena of recombination and multipleinfection are strongly intertwined, another goal of our
study is to examine the amount, patterns and evolutionary significance of inter- and intragenic recombination
both within single infection strains and between strains in
multiple-infected individuals. Most methods of recombination detection require a large number of informative
sites, creating a strong bias towards detecting inter-strain
recombination (particularly among inter-subtypes) versus
recombination within a single strain within a single host
[1]. By using an analytical technique developed specifically to detect intra-strain recombination in singly
infected hosts that can yield a statistically significant inference of recombination with as few as six nucleotide differences between the parental genomes [15,16], we can
examine the role of recombination at all these biological
levels with much greater resolution than previous studies.

Results
Incidence of multiple infection, coinfection, and
superinfection
Twenty-seven cases of potential polyphyly involving
clades of two or more haplotypes were discovered in
twenty-three of the participants (Table 1). In all of these
cases, the Templeton test strongly rejected the null
hypotheses of monophyly (all p's < 10-4, the lowest value
given by the program PAUP*) despite its conservative bias
(see Methods). These conclusions were also confirmed by
testing the null hypothesis of monophyly with the
Kishino-Hasegawa test, which also yields all p's < 10-4 in
PAUP*. Table 1 shows the twenty-three participants (40%
of the sample) that satisfied our criteria for multiple infection (see Methods). Of these, eleven participants were

*Individuals infected with three or more strains.
The initial proportion is the proportion of the sample at the first visit in which multiple infection was detected that was derived from the second
infecting viral strain or, in the case of infections on the first visit, of the strain that was rarest over all visits. Gene symbols marked by an asterisk
mean that two additional infecting strains were detected with that gene.

inferred to have multiple infection on the basis of
polyphyly of env alone, eleven on the basis of polyphyly
of pol alone, and one on the basis of polyphly of both env
and pol. Twenty individuals were inferred to have been
multiply infected by just one additional strain, whereas
three individuals were inferred to have been multiply
infected by at least two additional strains (all had three
distinct haplotype clusters in the env neighboring joining
tree). Out of the 19 participants reporting IDU prior to
study baseline, 11 had multiple infections, yielding an

incidence of 58% in the IDU subset versus 31% in the
non-IDU subset. These differences in incidence between
IDU and non-IDU are significant using a one-tailed
Fisher's Exact Test (p = 0.045). A one-tailed test is used
because of the a priori expectation that IDU should
increase the risk of multiple infection.
Of the 23 cases of multiple infection, 10 were inferred to
be potentially coinfected (infected at the first visit of the
study) and 13 definitely superinfected (a secondary infec-

tion occurred after an initial infection) (Table 1). There is
no significant difference between the incidence of potential co- and superinfection in the total sample. However,
IDUs have a significantly higher incidence of potential
coinfection than non-IDU's using a one-tailed Fisher's
Exact Test (p = 0.035). In contrast, a Fisher's Exact Test of
the incidence of superinfection versus no multiple-infection against IDU status was not significant (p = 0.23).
Moreover, limiting the analysis to just those individuals
with multiple infections, there was no significant association between putative coinfections and superinfections
versus IDU status using a Fisher's Exact Test (p = 0.273).
As described in the Methods section, there were no statistically significant differences between IDU and non-IDU
in HIV-1 RNA levels and CD4+ cell counts. Similarly, we
detected no statistically significant differences in these
two variables for multiple versus single infected individuals, superinfected versus non-superinfected individuals,
and coinfected versus non-coinfected individuals.
Temporal patterns of multiple infection
Table 1 summarizes the temporal patterns observed in the
23 participants who had multiple infections. Eight individuals became dual infected on the last visit sampled,
thus no inferences concerning the temporal fate of the
superinfection can be drawn. However, in three of these
eight cases, the only virions detected at the last visit were
from the second infection. In the remaining 15 individuals, the evidence for multiple-infection occurred in a visit
prior to the last sampled visit, with 10 of the individuals
having a multiple infection at the first visit, and hence
regarded as potential coinfections. Of the 10 putative
coinfected individuals, two were infected with three
strains at the first visit. In two of the coinfected cases, the
multiple-infection persisted throughout all subsequent
visits. Of the 18 strains found in the 15 individuals with
multiple infections prior to the last visit (pol is excluded
from subject 10 because pol was not scored on the last
visit, although this individual was placed into this class on
the basis of env, which was surveyed on the last visit), the
evidence for the superinfection was lost before the last
visit for 16 strains (89%).

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/6/1/54

strains, but the third strain was only detected by the env
gene. Hence, all 23 individuals with multiple infections
and 25 out of 26 multiple infecting strains (96%) experienced recombination between the pol and env genes with
the parental types being from two distinct infecting
strains. Only one superinfecting strain in one participant
had no detectable recombination between pol and env.
The initial average frequency of the secondary infecting
strain (or the strain that is numerically less dominant over
all visits when strains coexist during the first visit) is 0.47
(Table 1). This average includes the three cases in which
the second infection completely displaced the first infection in our sample. Excluding those cases reduces the average initial frequency to 0.40. Neither of these frequencies
is significantly different from 0.5. Hence, the secondary
infecting strain initially becomes nearly as frequent as the
first infecting strain. Under neutrality, we would therefore
expect roughly equal numbers of hosts to lose either the
initial strain or the recombinant strain given that one or
the other is ultimately lost. Of the 25 strains showing
recombination between pol and env in Table 1, one strain
ultimately declined to undetectable levels in 19 cases. Of
these, 16 (84%) lost the recombinant strain and 3 (16%)
lost the non-recombinant initial strain. Assuming a binomial distribution with p = 0.5, a difference that large or
larger has a probability of 0.0021 under the null hypothesis of neutrality.

The average length of a multiple-infection is 1.15 visits
(Table 1), and even when we exclude all participants in
which the multiple infection occurred only on the last
visit, the persistence time is still a low 1.21 visits.

Intragenic recombination within and between strains in all
individuals
Table 2 presents the inferred number of recombinants
meeting our criteria to eliminate PCR artifacts (see Materials and Methods) over all individuals studied as a function of IDU status, superinfection status, and gene
sequenced. The rates of recombination (number of
recombinants divided by number of individuals) vary
greatly over these categories. An exact test of homogeneity
of intrastrain recombination rates over the 8 distinct categories formed from the combinations of IDU status,
superinfection status, and gene rejected the null hypothesis of homogeneity with a 2-sided probability of 0.0001,
and similarly the null hypothesis of homogeneity was
rejected for the total intra- and interstrain recombination
rates with a 2-sided probability of 0.021. There were only
5 confirmed intragenic, interstrain recombinants, which
were too few to perform any meaningful tests of homogeneity on that class alone.

Intergenic recombination between strains in multipleinfected individuals and selection on recombinants
Of the 23 individuals inferred to have multiple infections,
only one was so inferred by both the pol and env genes
(individual 10, Table 1). Moreover, this individual experienced an additional infection, for a total of three infecting

To examine the source of this heterogeneity, we performed a logistic regression analysis using the presence or
absence of recombination as a binary response variable,
weighted either by the number of participants or the
number of recombination events given some recombination, with the factors of IDU status, multiple infection sta-

tus, and gene (pol or env), and all pairwise interactions
among these factors. Because the results were very similar
under either weighting scheme, only the results weighted
by the number of recombinants when recombination was
present are shown. Table 3 shows the results for intrastrain recombination and Table 4 the results for all recombination. If the singleton recombinants that were
excluded because they could be PCR artifacts are included
in the analyses, we obtained similar, but muted results
(results not shown). For the equivalent of Tables 3 and 4,
the IDU and Gene variables remain significant, but show
higher p-values than those given in Tables 3 and 4, and
the significant MI by Gene interaction in Table 3 is no
longer significant. This general muting of statistical significance despite increasing the number of recombinants in
the analysis is expected if the excluded class largely represents PCR artifacts. Such artifacts would reduce the biological signal, thereby eroding statistical power despite
increasing the number of recombination events in the
analysis. However, whether or not these singleton recombinants are included or excluded in the analysis, the general pattern shown in Tables 3 and 4 remains the same.
Of the observed five inter-strain, intragenic recombination events in multiple infected individuals, two were

detected at visits other than the visit at which polyphyly
was detected (our indicator of multiple infection). In one
case (subject 14 in Table 1), the interstrain recombinant
was detected in visit 1, the visit sampled just before the
next sampled visit (visit 9) at which polyphyly was
detected. This indicates that the multiple infection had
actually occurred earlier than the visit at which polyphyly
was detected. This is not surprising given that our sample
sizes were usually 10 per visit, so polyphyly would not be
detected with a high probability until the secondary strain
had built up its numbers. In the second case (subject 50 in
Table 1) polyphyly was detected only at visit 1, but the
recombinant was detected at visit 8, two sampled visits
removed from the visit leading to the inference of multiple infection. Although all phylogenetic evidence for multiple infection ended by visit 2, the multiple infection
obviously had a long-term effect, with some of its genetic
material persisting to the last sampled visit.
Rates of multiple-infection estimated from data
subsamples
Table 5 presents the estimated incidence of multiple infection in our total data set and in various subsamples of our
data. As can be seen, the expected incidence of multipleinfection is strongly influenced by the sampling design.

Results of the logistic regression on the binary variable of the presence or absence of all recombination as weighted by the number of recombinants
given some recombination against the factors of injection drug use (IDU) status, multiple infection (MI) status, gene (pol or env), and all their
pairwise interactions. All probabilities are exact.

Table 5 also presents the estimated incidence of multipleinfection from other studies in the row that corresponds
most closely to the sampling design used by that study. An
arcsin, square root test was also used to test the null
hypothesis that the incidence of multiple infection in the
other study was the same as the expected incidence in the
appropriate subsample of our data. The probability level
of the resulting test is also given in Table 5. In three cases,
our observed or estimated incidence of multiple infection
was not statistically significantly different from that of
other studies, in one case the difference was barely significant at the 5% level, and in one case the difference was
significant. Because we are testing the same null hypothesis multiple times, we also used a Bonferroni correction
for multiple testing. This correction indicates a required
threshold of p < 0.010 for overall significance at the 5%
level. Only the contrast of our results with Tsui et al. [14]
is significant. The most direct comparison between our
study and that of Tsui et al. [14] is for the env gene, the
only locus scored in common in the two studies. Tsui et

al. [14] scored between 10 to 13 env sequences per subject
for six individuals over two visits per subject. Our
expected incidence of multiple infection for a similar subsample of our data is 14%. The probability that all six
individuals would yield no inference of multiple infection
given a 14% expected rate is 0.40. Hence, when a direct
comparison can be made, our results are not statistically
inconsistent with those of Tsui et al. [14]. More individuals were scored for the first tat exon and p17 sequences in
the Tsui et al. study, but these genetic surveys were not
done from random plasmid subclones, invalidating any
further direct comparisons.

Discussion
Because we identified a large sample size of multipleinfected individuals in a longitudinal study, we were able
to observe a diverse array of temporal patterns (Table 1).
The most common pattern is the rapid elimination of the
secondary infecting strains. Hence, the multiple-infected
state is largely transitory. Due to our sample sizes of 10

sequences per visit, we cannot completely exclude persistence at a low frequency, though it is obvious that the most
common fate is for one strain to become numerically
dominant shortly after a multiple infection occurs. All of
our subjects were HIV+ when enrolled in the study, and
some of them may have had multiple infections prior to
enrollment that had been resolved into a homogeneous
population by the time of sampling. Also, we would not
detect any superinfections that occurred between two visits and that had become resolved prior to the sampling for
the second visit. Hence, our estimate of a multiple infection rate of 40% is conservative.
This rapid elimination of the secondary strain is not
expected from the initial state of the multiple-infection.
As shown in the Results section, the secondary infecting
strain initially becomes nearly as frequent as the first
infecting strain, but then tends to rapidly lose its numerical parity and becomes undetectable. These dramatic
numerical changes imply strong non-random forces. The
initial high frequency of the second infecting strain could
be explained by an initial escape of the secondary strain
from a strong immune surveillance by the host, just the
opposite of the immunological protection hypothesis
proposed by others [11,13,14]. This initial advantage
might then be lost as the host's immune system begins to
target the new, numerically co-dominant strain. The subsequent rapid numerical decline of the secondary strain
indicates that the first strain has a strong competitive
advantage, perhaps due to having had a longer period of
evolutionary time in which to adapt to the local host environment. An exception to this pattern is the two cases in
which the multiple-infection persisted from the first to the
final visit. Both of these cases are possible co-infections, so
both strains could have about the same amount of time to
adapt to the local host and both could be targeted by the
immune system equally. Under the competitive exclusion
principle, the two cases of co-infection with continued
coexistence could be explained by each strain adapting to
different niches within the host and/or by having densitydependent competitive inhibitory interactions with one
another [17,18].
In three participants (13%) the original strain was displaced by a secondary strain (Table 1), a pattern previously reported in studies of single superinfected
individuals [9,4]. This displacement is only partial in a
genetic sense since all three cases of displacement
involved an intergenic recombinant. Likewise, previous
reports of displacement were due to a recombinant
between the initial and the superinfecting strain [9,4].
Thus, the initial strain was not completely replaced genetically, but rather some of its genetic material was used by
the displacing superinfecting strain.

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/6/1/54

Our observed probability of recombination between multiple infecting strains was 0.96, indicating that interstrain
recombination is common in multiply infected individuals, as expected from previous studies [1,2,8]. The high
frequency of recombinants does not necessarily mean that
recombinants are selectively favored; indeed, our results
revealed significant overall selection against interstrainrecombinants (the null hypothesis of neutrality is rejected
with a probability of 0.0021). Hence, most of the time,
selection appears to work to eliminate the superinfecting
strain and its recombinants, but occasionally some recombinants may have very superior fitness [13], as shown by
our three cases of recombinant displacement.
We detected 78 intrastrain recombination events and five
interstrain recombinants in multiple infected participants
(Table 2). The intrastrain recombination reveals many
non-random patterns, as shown by the homogeneity and
logit (Tables 3 and 4) analyses. First, injection drug users
experience significantly higher levels of recombination
(Tables 3 and 4). Second, the env gene displays more
recombination than the pol gene despite the fact that the
average length of the pol sequences in our study was 1496
bp versus 686 for env. One possible explanation is that
there is more recombination within env than within pol,
but the opposite has been observed using an in vitro
recombination system [19]. Hence, either the in vivo
recombination patterns are different from those in vitro, or
another factor is operating that reverses this recombination bias. This other factor may be selection. We only
score as recombinants those recombination events that
left two or more descendants, and therefore have demonstrated at least a minimal degree of evolutionary success.
Our previous studies indicate strong positive selection on
the env gene within these same individuals [20]. Intragenic recombination within env could be an important
source of variation upon which this selection could operate, thereby amplifying the apparent amount of intragenic
recombination within env despite a recombination bias in
favor of pol at the molecular level [19].
In two cases inter-strain, intragenic recombination events
were detected at visits after the visit at which polyphyly
was detected. These persistent recombinant genetic materials were not detected as a continuation of the multipleinfection because the section of the genes that came from
the secondary strain was so small that the recombinant
clustered with the primary infecting strain to form a single
monophyletic group in the neighbor joining tree. Thus, if
only these latter visits had been sampled, the criterion of
polyphyly, which is standard in this literature, would have
failed to detect any evidence for multiple-infection even
though that evidence was present in the multi-visit analysis. Thus, the criteria of polyphyly alone can fail to detect

Retrovirology 2009, 6:54

multiple infections that have been affected by much
recombination.
In light of these biases, we conclude that multiple-infection is common, but difficult to detect because natural
selection and/or competitive exclusion causes the multiple-infected state to be highly transitory. The one lasting
legacy of such multiple infections is recombinant virions.
Most recombinants do not survive long in the host, but a
few persist throughout the infection, and some of these
recombinants even displace the original infection, indicating superior fitness and competitive ability. The pattern
observed in our cohort is compatible with the observation
that recombinant clades of HIV-1 are common throughout the world. Thus, multiple infection and recombination significantly add to the genetic diversity of HIV-1 and
its evolutionary potential, and injection drug use significantly increases both.

Conclusion
Our multiple infection incidence of 40% is consistent
with the inference of high rates of multiple infection from
inter-subtype recombination data [1,8], but it is significantly higher (a 2-sided p-value of 1.4 × 10-5) than the
indirectly estimated intra-subtype multiple infection rate
of 15% [8]. This discrepancy is explicable due to the significant selection we detected against the interstrain
recombinants. Our rate of successful superinfection
recombinants is between 5/58 (9%) (individuals with
superinfections that survived to the last visit but appeared
in earlier visits) to a maximum of 10/58 (17%) (by adding
in those individuals who became superinfected on the last
visit), a range that straddles the indirect estimate of 15%
[8]. Hence, our results explain well the rate at which such
recombinants are detected in the general HIV-1 population.
Our multiple-infection incidence of 40% is not statistically significantly different from the direct incidences
between 0–14% reported in previous studies (Table 5 and
Results section), illustrating the critical importance of
sampling design in making inference. Hence, there is no
real discrepancy between the direct and indirect estimates
of multiple-infection incidence.
The fact that our cohort had a high incidence of multiple
infection, and specifically superinfection, undermines the
hypothesis that an initial HIV-1 infection produces some
degree of protection against superinfection [11,13,14].
This in turn may imply that vaccine development will be
difficult, as indeed appears to be the case [21,22]. However, these superinfections occur, at least in part, in individuals whose immune systems have already been
compromised by HIV, a situation that will not pertain to
vaccinated individuals. Hence, our results do not mean

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/6/1/54

that an effective vaccine cannot be developed, but rather
they do caution us about the difficulties of vaccine development.

Methods
Study population
The Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) is a multicenter, prospective cohort study to investigate the impact
of HIV-1 infection on women [23]. In 1994, 2,628
women (2,059 HIV-1 positive and 569 HIV-1 negative)
were recruited by both institution and community based
programs. Every six months the participants met with
study personnel for an encounter termed a "visit", during
which WIHS participants are interviewed using a structured questionnaire and received a physical examination
[23]. Informed consent was obtained from all study participants at the individual WIHS sites and human experimentation guidelines of the individual sites and of the
Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health were
followed in the conduct of this research.

Fifty-eight HIV-1 infected individuals contributing 123
study visits were selected for analysis. All samples were
from visits that occurred between initiation of the WIHS
and 2000. All participants met the following criteria: 1) A
defined IDU status 2) a visit within 12 months prior to
initiating highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) 3)
a viral load >4,000 copies/ml of plasma to avoid re-sampling the same virion [24] and 4) a CD4 T cell count <200
on the last pre-HAART visit as an indication of disease
progression. Nineteen IDU (33%) met these criteria and
from the non-IDU that met the criteria 39 (67%) were
randomly selected for further analysis.
The median age of the 58 WIHS participants at baseline
was 38 years, the overall median log10 (HIV-1 RNA) level
was 4.80 cps/ml and the overall median CD4+ cell count
was 311 cells/mm3. The majority (64%; n = 37) of study
participants were African-American. Compared to the
non-IDUs, IDUs had higher median log10 HIV-1 RNA levels (4.97 (4.40, 5.34) vs. 4.66 (4.15, 5.26)) and lower
median CD4+ cell counts (200 (85, 479) vs. 359 (133,
572)), but the differences were not statistically significant.
Racial composition did not differ between the IDU and
non-IDU groups. Study participants reporting a history of
IDU were older than those not reporting IDU prior to
enrollment (40 vs. 35; P = 0.03). All participants reporting
IDU were HCV positive at baseline, while only 4 (11%) of
the non-IDUs were HCV positive (P < 0.01). Although
treatment was initiated from different sites within the
multi-centered WIHS cohort, treatment was generally
based on the standard of therapy at the time of each subject's study visit. Among non-IDUs, 20 (51%) participants
reported using monotherapy or combination therapy
prior to study entry, compared to 12 (63%) participants

Page 8 of 12

Retrovirology 2009, 6:54

with a history of IDU (P = 0.72). All monotherapy and
combination therapy reported prior to study enrollment
consisted of only nucleoside and/or non-nucleoside
reverse transcriptase inhibitors.
Sequencing technique
A total of 1100 cloned sequences of the pol gene and 1100
of the env gene of HIV-1 were obtained as described in an
earlier study [25]. Additional sequences were obtained for
this study to fill in some sampling gaps, for a total of
1,127 pol and 1236 env sequences. Our goal was to sample
10 sequences for each gene from each visit (1230 total
sequences for each gene given 123 visits), but occasionally
that goal was not meet, with the smallest sample size per
gene per visit being four. HIV-1 RNA was isolated from
stored samples of plasma using the QIA amp viral RNA
mini-kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, California, USA). The isolated RNA was subjected to RT-PCR (Life Technologies
Superscript One-Step RT-PCR for long templates). To
avoid contamination among subject visits, all plasma
samples from a subject visit were processed for reverse
transcription and amplification singly (one at a time) in a
PCR clean room within the laboratory in which no amplified specimens were permitted. After sequencing, all
sequences from the study population were aligned and
placed on a single phylogenetic tree to ensure that there
were no closely related sequences appearing among different individuals. In eighteen instances (out of the 2364
total sequences) an env or pol sequence was indeed phylogenetically located within a monophyletic cluster defined
by the sequences from a different subject. All eighteen
sequences were regarded as potential contaminants and
excluded from all subsequent analyses.

For the pol gene, we used the primers pro-1 (TTGGAAATGTGGAAAGGAAGGAC) and RT-0 (CATATTGTGAGTCTGTTACTATGTTTAC) with cycles of 50°C 30 minutes,
94°C 2 minutes, and 35 cycles of 94°C 40 seconds, 50°C
40 seconds, 68°C 3 minutes, followed by one cycle of
72°C 10 minutes and then held at 4°C. A second round
PCR was run using the Gene Amp XL PCR kit (Roche
Applied Biosystems, Indianapolis, IN), with the primers
pro-3 (GAGCCAACAGCCCCACC) and RT-3 (GCTGCCCCATCTACATAGAA); with an amplification protocol of 94°C for 1 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for
40 seconds, 52°C–56°C for 40 seconds, 68°C for 2 minutes, 30 seconds, followed by one cycle of 72°C for 10
minutes with the product held at 4°C until it was harvested and run on an 8% agarose gel. A band at the 1,617
base-pair size was extracted from the gel using the QIA
Quik Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, California,
USA), and the obtained DNA was ligated into the TOPO
2.1 vector and transformed into TOPO 10 competent cells
(Qiagen, Valencia, California, USA), according to the
manufacturer's instructions. The transformed cells were
plated on LB agar plates containing 50 μg/ml Ampicillin

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/6/1/54

and 40 μl of 40 mg/ml X-gal. Confirmed transformants
were grown overnight and plasmid DNA was extracted for
sequencing, using an ABI prism 3700 DNA Analyzer (Perkin Elmer Biosystems, Boston, Massachusetts, USA). The
cloned sequences were obtained in nucleotide format and
translated into amino acids using MegAlign software by
DNAStar (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI). The entire protease (PR) region (297 nucleotides) and partial reverse
transcriptase (pRT) region (674 nucleotides, including all
known sites of resistance mutations) were available from
each of the 123 study visits [25]. The pol sequences generated are available through Genbank, Accession Numbers
EF374379–EF375478. Note that these sequences were
aligned for each individual subject, but were not aligned
across individuals. Phylogenetic analysis requires aligned
sequences, both within and across individuals, and a file
containing the alignment for all pol sequences is available
upon request from ART.
The same technique was used for sequencing the C2–V5
regions of the envgene. The first round primers were
ED12C (AGTGCTTCCTGCTGCTCCCA) and ED31C
(CCATTACACAGGCCTGTCCAAAG) and the second
round primers used were DR7C (TCAACTCAACTGGTCCAAAG) and DR8C (CACTTCTCCAATTGTCCCTCA) that
yield data on 694 nucleotides in the aligned sequences.
The env sequences generated are available through Genbank, Accession Numbers EU040366–EU041600. Note
that these sequences were aligned for each individual subject, but were not aligned across individuals. Phylogenetic
analysis requires aligned sequences, both within and
across individuals, and a file containing the alignment for
all env sequences is available upon request from ART.
Because the sequences are very similar within the monophyletic clusters, our principal concern was the alignment
across clusters. To check the quality of this alignment, representative sequences were chosen from the monophyletic
clusters and assessed for alignment quality using the program ClustalX [26]. For pol, the low quality sites were
highly scattered, indicating an overall excellent alignment
with no problematic blocks. For env, there were two clusters of low quality alignment, one of 29 nucleotides in
length and a second of 18 nucleotides in length. Both
regions were characterized by many inferred insertions or
deletions. The inclusion or exclusion of these nucleotide
sites had no impact on the topology of the neighbor-joining tree relative to the inferred monophyletic clusters, the
only purpose for which this tree was used. The env and pol
neighbor-joining trees are available in additional files 1
and 2.
Inference criteria for multiple, coinfection and
superinfection
All the pol sequence data from all participants and all visits
were used to construct a neighbor-joining tree for the pol
gene using PAUP* [27], and likewise all the env sequence

Retrovirology 2009, 6:54

data from all participants and all visits were used to construct a neighbor-joining tree for the env gene. The program ModelTest [28] was used to fit the nucleotide data to
a substitution model, and for both env and pol, the best fitting model using the Akaike criterion was TVM+I+G (a
transversional model with unequal base frequencies,
some invariant sites, and rate variation among sites). Our
only use of these neighbor-joining trees was to test for
monophyletic clusters. As to be described, all the monophyletic clusters in these data were separated by multiple
mutations (a minimum of 31) that yield extremely long
branch lengths in the neighbor-joining trees that would
be easily detected by any clustering technique. As will also
be described, we did not use neighbor-joining to infer the
evolutionary trees within a monophyletic cluster but
rather used the Bayesian procedure of statistical parsimony.
An individual subject was regarded as having only a single
source infection if both the pol and env sequences defined
a single monophyletic cluster in the respective multi-subject neighbor-joining trees. Additional analyses were performed if one or both genes from a specific subject
defined two or more disjoint clusters (polyphyly) within
the multi-subject neighbor-joining tree(s). When
polyphyly was detected, a tree was constructed that forced
all the sequences from a single subject to be monophyletic, and the Templeton test option [29,30] in PAUP*
[27] was used to test the null hypothesis that the
polyphyletic tree was not significantly different from the
monophyletic tree. When sequences are forced to be
monophyletic, long branches are created in the trees to
explain the enforced monophyly. Homoplasy (multiple
mutational hits at the same nucleotide site that cause
reversals and/or parallelisms) are very common in HIV
data, and long branches tend to be underestimated in
length preferentially by parsimony when homoplasy is
common. Because the Templeton test acquires greater statistical power as the estimated branch length increases, the
high levels of homoplasy typical of HIV data sets means
that the Templeton test will be a statistically conservative
test of monophyly.
As discussed previously, 18 sequences were regarded as
possible contaminates and excluded from this analysis of
polyphyly. Multiple infection was inferred only when two
or more distinct polyphyletic clades (branches) existed
within an individual such that at least two clades contained two or more haplotypes for one or both genes.
Multiple infections detected on the first visit were
regarded as potential coinfections, and all other cases of
multiple infection were regarded as superinfections. As all
of the participants were already HIV positive at baseline, it
is possible that some of the potential coinfected cases

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/6/1/54

were actually superinfections. Hence, our estimate of
coinfection may be biased upwards and our estimate of
superinfection may be biased downwards. This also
means that all tests of heterogeneity between coinfected
and superinfected individuals will be biased in favor of
the null hypothesis of homogeneity.
Recombination
Recombination between the pol and env genes in multipleinfected individuals was inferred when only one of these
genes resulted in polyphyly. Recombination within the pol
sequences and within the env sequences was inferred by
the method of Crandall and Templeton [15] as modified
by Templeton et al. [16]. This method was specifically
developed for detected recombination in HIV [15]. Separate evolutionary trees for the pol and env sequences of all
the haplotypes (unique sequences) found in a single individual over all visits were estimated using statistical parsimony [31] with the program TCS [32]. The haplotype tree
represents the null hypothesis of no recombination. Individual mutational transitions that appear on multiple
branches (homoplasies) in the tree may be the result of
recurrent mutation or recombination. Recombination as a
cause of homoplasy can be distinguished from recurrent
mutation because homoplasies caused by recombination
are physically clustered in the sequence. This results in
spatially contiguous runs of homoplasies in the tree. A
runs test [implemented in a Mathematica [33] program
available by request from ART] is used to test the null
hypothesis of no association between homoplasies and
physical location in the DNA or RNA region. Recombination is only inferred when the runs test is statistically significant at the 5% level or less. This procedure identifies
both the putative recombinant and its parents and localizes the interval in which recombination occurred. This
test is particularly appropriate for HIV sequence data,
which is strongly affected by mutational homoplasy and
selection. The run test is conditioned upon the topology
of the tree and depends only upon the clustering of homoplasies on a single branch that are also physically clustered
in the nucleotide sequence. The selection that has been
documented in HIV sequence data is not associated with
such close physical clustering [20], and most tests of selection are sensitive to frequencies of SNPs or haplotypes,
which do not enter into this statistic at all. Moreover, high
levels of homoplasy often cause loops in the statistical
parsimony tree, which represent phylogenetic ambiguities. However, when tracing runs through such loops, the
resulting set of runs is invariant to how the loop is traversed and depends only upon the nucleotide differences
between the sequences at the end-points of the run.

RT-PCR can also induce recombination during sequence
amplification [34]. To focus only on recombination
events that occurred naturally within an infected subject,

we excluded all those recombination events that were
identified by only a single recombinant sequence, which
always had to be located at the terminus of a branch in the
evolutionary tree of haplotypes. We regarded as true
recombination only those events from which a monophyletic branch (clade) evolved that contained two or
more sequences in the evolutionary tree of haplotypes.

performed sequencing. JK, M-FY, H-LT, and HZ were
involved in organization and analysis of sequence data.
RM initiated studies of these populations for sequence
analysis and has discussed the theoretical basis for these
studies extensively with ART. Dr. Markham's laboratory
performed all of the sequencing required for these analyses.

Statistical analyses
The null hypothesis of no association between two binary
categorical variables was tested with a Fisher's Exact Test,
as implemented in the program StatXact 7.0 (Cytel Software Corporation). Homogeneity of recombination rates
over various classifications was also tested with an exact
test with StatXact 7.0. An exact logistic regression was performed with the program LogXact 7.0 (Cytel Software
Corporation) to investigate the impact of IDU status, multiple infection status, and gene upon recombination.

Additional material

Differences in proportions were tested with an arcsin,
square root transformation corrected for small sample
size [35] as implemented in a Mathematica [33] program
available by request from ART. Comparisons between various groups of participants for viral load and CD4+ cell
counts were executed in Excel (Microsoft) using a twotailed t-test without assuming equal variances.
Because our sample design is fuller than that of most previous surveys for multiple infections, we also analyze subsamples of our data in order to compare our results to
previously published results. In some cases our subsample
is based on a stratifying variable, such as a subsample
based upon having only pol sequence data. In such cases,
we simply estimate the rate of multiple-infection from our
data using only the information gained from pol data
strata and ignoring the env sequence data strata. In other
cases, we form a subsample at random. For example, to
simulate what we have found if we only had cross-sectional data, we calculate the rate of multiple infection that
we would have observed by using the data from only one
randomly chosen visit per subject. Other subsamples
reflect a mixture of these stratifying and random subsamples; e.g., a sub-sample that simulates a cross-sectional
study done only with pol.
