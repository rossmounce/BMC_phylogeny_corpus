Abstract
Background: Rab proteins are regulators of vesicular trafficking, requiring a lipid modification for
proper function, prenylation of C-terminal cysteines. This is catalysed by a complex of a catalytic
heterodimer (Rab Geranylgeranyl Transferase – RabGGTase) and an accessory protein (Rab Escort
Protein. REP). Components of this complex display domain insertions relative to paralogous
proteins. The function of these inserted domains is unclear.
Results: We profiled the domain architecture of the components of the Rab prenylation complex
in evolution. We identified the orthologues of the components of the Rab prenylation machinery
in 43 organisms, representing the crown eukaryotic groups. We characterize in detail the domain
structure of all these components and the phylogenetic relationships between the individual
domains.
Conclusion: We found different domain insertions in different taxa, in α-subunits of RGGTase
and REP. Our results suggest that there were multiple insertions, expansions and contractions in
the evolution of this prenylation complex.

Background
Protein prenyl transferases are a family of protein complexes that catalyze the lipid modification of proteins with
isoprenoid groups. There are covalently attached to
cysteine residues near or at the C-termini of intracellular
proteins via tioether linkages (reviewed in [1,2]). The family includes Protein Farnesyl Transferase (FTase), Geranylgeranyl Transferase I (GGTase I) and RabGeranylgeranyl
Transferase (RabGTTase). FTase and GGTase I modify Cterminal cystein residues in the context of a CAAX motif
with a 15 or 20 carbon isoprenoid, respectively, and are
thus termed CAAX prenyltransferases (A stands for
aliphatic residue, X for any residue). Substrates of the
FTase include Ras family small GTPases, nuclear lamins,
centromeric proteins among others, whereas substrates of

the latter include the Rho family of small GTPases and
heterotrimeric G protein γ subunits (reviewed in reference
[3]). RabGGTase in contrast is specific to the Rab family of
small GTPases, and catalyses the modification of these
with two or sometimes one 20 carbon isoprenoid. It also
differs from the CAXX prenyltransferases by the absolute
requirement for an accessory protein, termed Rab Escort
Protein (REP) for proper catalysis (reviewed in [4]). Protein prenylation affects proteins involved in a multitude
of cellular processes, is involved in a variety of human diseases and therepaeutic approaches and this is extensively
reviewed, for example in references [3-6].

subunit, the REP protein(s). The genes coding for these
enzymes have been cloned in a variety of species and
shown to be essential for life [7-9]. FTase and GGTaseI
share the α-subunit, but have distinct β-subunits, whereas
the α- and β-subunits of RabGGTase are coded by distinct
genes. The three-dimensional structure of the three
enzymes has been solved, and revealed that the three
enzymes are structurally homologous (see Figure 1). The
α-subunit is a right-handed, crescent shaped, super-helix
composed by 15 α-helices wrapped around the α-α barrel
of the β-subunit [10,11]. RabGGTase is a similar αβ heterodimer but the rat protein displays the insertion of two
additional domains in the α-subunit relative to the other
prenyltransferases, and to the yeast protein, a Ig-like
domain and a Leucine Rich Repeat domain [12]. In contrast with the CAXX prenyltransferases that recognize the
C-terminal motif of the substrate proteins via the β, catalytic subunit, RabGGTase recognizes the substrate by
interactions of the α-subunit with an extra protein, REP.
The rat REP, like the α-subunit, displays an insertion relative to the yeast orthologue and the paralogous RabGDI
[13,14] (Figure 1). Protein prenyltransferases are believed
to have evolved from an ancestral heterodimer, which by
gene duplication gave rise to the current constellation of
subunits [15].
The role of gene duplication in the evolution of protein
complexes has been subject of recent interest [16-19].
Individual gene duplications can contribute to specialization of protein complexes, and can also accumulate to the
point where two or more fully independent protein complexes exist [16,19]. Less well understood is the role of
domain insertions and deletions in the context of protein
complexes. Protein domains are the basic evolutionary
units in protein evolution [20,21]. Proteins can gain, rearrange and loose domains in the course of evolution.
Domain gains result mostly from fusions of independent
genes that contain one or more domains and it is perhaps
the most frequent mechanism of protein evolution after
gene duplication [22]. It can also be a consequence of
duplication followed by in-frame fusion, resulting in tandem duplications. Less frequently, domain insertions may
happen, situations where one or more domains are
inserted into another domain, usually in loop regions
[23,24]. Domain losses are less well understood, but
recent evidence suggests that they are most abundant at Ctermini and due to the premature stop codons [25]. Rearrangements or circular permutations can be achieved by
complete duplication with in-frame fusion followed by
partial deletion of domains at the termini, the most frequent mechanism [26], but also by independent fusion
[26] and also by a mechanism termed "cut and paste"
where a gene is fragmented, for example by the action of
endonucleases, and then reassembles the resulting fragments in a different order [27].

Here we characterize the domain architectures of the components of the Rab prenylation complex, i.e. the heterodimer αβ of RGGTase and the accessory protein REP.
We find that orthologous proteins display diverse domain
architectures, suggestive of multiple independent events
involving gains and losses of domains.

Results and discussion

α subunit – tetratricopeptide repeats
The rat α-subunit of RGGTase is very similar to the corresponding α-subunit of FTase, containing 15 α-helices
arranged in a crescent-shaped, double layered righthanded superhelix, enveloping the β-subunit [11,12]. Its
structural architecture, together with statistically significant sequence similarity with the tetratricopeptide repeat
(TPR) motif indicates that it belongs of the TPR superfamily [15]. An individual TPR is a pair of anti-parallel αhelices, with consensus residues mediating the packing of
these helices [15]. In the rat RGGTase α-subunit these 7
TPR are helices 2 to 15. The crystal structure of the Rat
RGGTase revealed two additional domains, a C-terminal
Leucine Rich Repeat domain (LRR), and an Ig-like
domain inserted between helices 11 and 12, i.e. between
TPR 5 and 6. This is the exact same loop where in the
FTase α-subunit there is a short 310 helix between α-helices 11 and 12 [11].
We investigated the complete and partial genome
sequences of 43 organisms, covering the crown eukaryotic
groups discicristates, excavates, alveolata, heterokonts,
plants, amoebozoa and the opisthokonts (metazoa, fungi
and choanoflagelates) [28]. In all the organisms with a
complete genome sequence available, we detect a putative
RGGTase α-subunit (Figure S1). Thus we can conclude
that the last eukaryotic common ancestor already possessed this subunit. FTase α-subunits were also found in
the majority of the organisms studied (Figure S1), suggesting that the duplication that gave rise to the two distinct
α-subunits preceded the split of the eukaryotic crown
groups.
Detailed phylogenetic reconstruction of the evolutionary
relationships between α-subunits based solely on the
TPRs shows that the α-subunits of each enzyme are monophyletic (Figure S1). It is then most likely that there was
one and only one gene duplication event that created the
two paralogous subunits, and that this happened at the
base of the eukaryotic tree. Furthermore, the fact that the
secondary structure composed of 15 repeating helices
with TPRs is conserved suggests that the ancestral of prenyltransferases already had this configuration.
We find that the secondary structure of this subunit varies
in evolution, displaying multiple domain insertions in
different organisms, which we characterize below.

α subunit – C2-like domain
Rat RGGTase a-subunit displays an inserted globular
domain between helices 11 and 12 [12]. The function of
this domain is unclear, but it is clearly not involved in
contacts with REP nor the Rab substrates [29]. This globular domain is a β sandwich composed of eight strands in
two sheets. It is a domain broadly related to the Ig fold,
and in the two papers describing the structure of the complex it was termed an Ig-like domain. This is consistent
with the CATH hierarchy, a fully automated classification
of protein structures [30]. Here we will consider instead
the SCOP classification of evolutionary relationships
between proteins structures, as it complements automated classification with manual curation [21,31]. SCOP
1.71 classifies this domain as an independent superfamily, included in the C2 domain-like fold. From now
on we will refer to this domain as the C2 domain-like.
The full SCOP hierarchy for this domain is shown in additional file 1 (Figure S2). This fold includes superfamilies
such as the C2 domain. This is a domain that is found in
multiple eukaryotic proteins and is involved in signaling,
vesicular transport, modification of lipids, among other

functions [32]. C2 domains usually regulate their respective protein function by establishing Ca2+-dependent and
Ca2+-independent phospholipids complexes. One class of
C2 domains can bind Ca2+ without binding phospholipids [33]. Recently, the C2 domain of PKCd was shown to
mediate protein-protein interactions by binding directly
to phosphotyrosine peptides in a sequence-specific manner [34]. It is unclear if the RabGGTase C2-lke domain
displays any of these functions. Since the role of Rab isoprenylation is to allow hydrophilic Rab proteins to associated with cellular membranes, it is plausible to think that
such modification should occur in proximity to those
membranes. If this C2 domain-like is a phospholipidbinding domain, then it could play a role in bringing the
prenylation reaction next to membranes. Ultra-structural
studies could be used to test this hypothesis.
It was previously observed that this domain was not
present in the yeast orthologue of α-subunit RGGTase, but
that it would be present in worm also [15]. We analyzed
in detail the sequences between helices 11 and 12 of RGGTase, where the Rat C2-like domain is found [12], and
also where the FTase a-subunit displays an inserted 310

In between the 5th and 6th TPR some proteins display an inserted domain. In deuterostomes this is a C2-like domain (inverted
orange triangle), but in other organisms the inserted sequences are not recognized as any known domain. They are represented by colored lines. Inserts of the same color are similar to each other. Ellipses represent LRR domains – distinct colors

helix [11]. We found that only a restricted number of
branches on the eukaryotic tree display insertions in this
region (Figure 2). These include metazoa, plants and alveolata. All other branches of the tree have a predicted secondary structure similar to that of Bet2 in S. cerevisae,
which does no display any insertion between the two
TPRs.
Next we investigated whether the insert we found on the
three distinct branches of the tree of life are similar, and
hence likely to represent one single insertion event in the

ancestor of all RGGTases that was subsequently lost in
other branches. Or instead whether they are distinct
domains, resulting from independent insertion or expansion events. Our results favor the second hypothesis (Figure 2). We find that the inserted domains are similar
within taxonomical groups, but different beyond recognition across taxa. By difference beyond recognition we
mean BLAST sequence searches [35], Pfam [36] and
Superfamily [37,38] domain assignments and secondary
structure predictions [39,40]. Thus, in Metazoa, all Deuterostomes have a clearly defined C2-like domain, but the

insects and the nematodes have a distinct insertion conserved solely in their taxonomical group. In the plants,
angiosperms have a conserved domain in the same region
of the α-subunit, but different beyond recognition from
any other insert of the orthologous α-subunits. The same
is true for alveolata. The size of the insertion is also conserved with taxonomic group but not across groups. For
example, whereas deuterostomes have an insert of near
125 amino residues long, plants have a larger one, nearing
200 residues (Figure S3). Our results are thus compatible
at least with up to five distinct insertion and/or expansion
events in the same position of the α-subunit of RGGTase.
One exciting possibility is that all these insertions and or
expansions represent the same function accomplished by
different sequences, as this would expand our repertoire
of sequence-function relationships.
Multiple sequence insertions/expansions in the same site
suggest that this site is capable of accommodating structural variations more easily than others. Thus there seems
to be a structural constraint in place. The fact that the paralogous α-subunit of FTase contains an inserted region in
between these helices, in the form of a 310 helix adds support to this hypothesis. However, if the function of these
distinct insertions and/or expansions is the same, then
this could be the only place where this function is possible, and thus the recurrent use of the same site reflect functional rather than structural constraint. In the absence of
information regarding the role played by these insertions/
expansions it is not possible to resolve this question.

α subunit – LRR domain
At the C-terminus of rat RGGTase α-subunit there is a Leucine Rich Repeat domain (Figure 1). This domain in not
present in FTase (Figure 1). LRRs belong to the SCOP fold
of the same name, which groups proteins forming a righthanded β-α superhelix [21,31]. It is formed by three
superfamilies, the RNI-like, Outer arm dynein light chain
and the L domain-like which includes the RGGTase LRR
domain. LRRs are involved in a variety of biological processes, both in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Their common
role is the establishment of complexes with other proteins
[41,42].
We now investigate whether this LRR domain is a feature
of all RGGTase α-subunits, which would suggest that it
was present in the ancestral eukaryote, or if it is a recent
acquisition restricted to a specific taxon or set of taxa. It is
clear from the results shown in Figure 2 that the LRR
domain is not universal, as we can only detect it in some
animals, in angiosperms and in alveolata. This phylogenetic profile is consistent with two evolutionary scenarios
– independent domain fusions or a single domain fusion
at the base of the eukaryotic tree followed by a specific

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/140

domain loss in multiple branches of the eukaryotic tree.
Both scenarios seem equally unlikely, so we investigated
this further using phylogenetic reconstruction based on
the LRR domain sequences only. Our hypotheses is that
there is enough phylogenetic signal in these sequences to
solve this puzzle. In Figure 3 we show three phylogenies
of the LRRs, including sequences from other superfamilies
as reference, reconstructed by three distinct methods.
Plant and vertebrate LRR are consistently monophyletic,
suggesting a common origin. In contrast, the LRR of
Ciona, of nematodes and of alveolata segregate with different reference sequences. This varies according to the
method used to reconstruct phylogeny. It is thus impossible at this stage to resolve the question regarding the common or independent origin of the LRR sequences in the αsubunit. However, the recent observation that convergent
evolution of domain architectures is very rare, with an
estimated frequency of 0.4% to 4% [43], is more supportive of the first scenario.

β-subunit domain architecture
The β-subunit of rat RGGTase is a α-α barrel composed of
12 α helices. It is very similar to the α-α barrel in the βsubunit of FTase [12]. The β-subunits of prenyltransferases are more conserved than the α subunits, but identification and classification of RGGTase β-subunit was
simple using a combination of BLAST searches of
sequences databases followed by phylogenetic analysis
(Figure S4).
We discussed above that the α-subunit display multiple
sequence insertions in different species. Below we will
show that in some species REP also display inserted
sequences. The β-subunit in contrast appears to have an
invariable domain architecture throughout evolution. We
investigated its structural relatives in order to gain insight
whether this is due to structural constraints. In order to do
so, we investigated the SCOP hierarchical classification of
protein structures. Prenyl transferase's β-subunits belong
to the "α-α toroid" fold (SCOP: 48207), Terpenoid cyclases/Protein prenyltransferases superfamily (SCOP:
48239). This fold consists of multihelical proteins displaying up to seven alpha-hairpins arranged in a closed
circular array. Therpene synthases are classified into the
same superfamily. These proteins are characterized by two
α-α domains in the same peptide chain; the first is an α6α6 barrel of two concentric rings, whereas the second is a
barrel with 10 α helices, one 310 helix and at least two βstrands inserted in between helical elements [44]. It
appears then that this superfamily can have varying
number of helical elements as well as accommodate extra
structural elements. It is then plausible that the invariable
nature of the domain architecture of β-subunits is due to
functional rather than structural constraints.

In animals and yeast it is clear that RGGTase is composed
of independent α and β-subunits. In contrast GGTase I
and FTase have distinct β-subunits, but share a α-subunit.
Thus the GGTase I and FTase are related by a single gene
duplication. In contrast, RGGTase is separated from the
other prenyltrasnsferases by two gene duplications.
Although the number of duplication steps that separates

the different enzymes is clear, the order of duplication is
not. In other words, we don't know which subunits
emerged first and which resulted from these by duplication. We find that all organisms with a complete genome
sequence that we investigated display a β-subunit of RGGTase (Figure 2). Considering we also always find a RGGTase α-subunit in the same organisms, it follows that the

ancestor of all eukaryotes already had a distinct and fully
separated RGGTase.
REP
Rab escort proteins (REP) belong to the same protein family as Rab GDP dissociation inhibitors (RabGDI). They are
both classified in the SCOP hierarchy [31] as FAD/
NAD(P)-binding domain fold and superfamily, which
suggests a common ancestry. Their structure comprises
two domains: domain I include the Rab binding platform,
whereas domain II in REP mediates binding to the alphasubunit of RGGTase [29,45]. REP and RabGDI share conserved regions, termed SCRs (sequence conserved
regions), which are highlighted in Figure 4 as brown
boxes. Multiple sequence alignments of REPs and RabGDI
reveal that mammalian REPs display an insertion between
domain I and domain II, absent in RabGDI, which maps
roughly to a sequence region delimited by the conserved
regions SCR1B and SCR2 [13,45]. This insert appears to
be larger in vertebrate sequences than in S. cerevisae [13].
The function of this insert is unclear, particularly at the
light of the recent structure of REP1 in complex with
RGGT, which shows that it is not involved in contacts
with the RGGTase subunits nor with Rab substrates [29].

We identified REPs in all species studied here by searching
GeneBank and the other genomic databases (see methods) with known REP sequences. We used phylogenetic
reconstruction to classify the obtained sequences into the
REP and RabGDI subfamilies (Figure 4B). We identified at
least one distinct REP sequence in all species for which a
complete genome sequence was available. Mammals have
two paralogous REPS (REP-1 or Choroideremia and REP2 or CHM-like). X. laevis also displays two paralogous
REPs, but our phylogenetic analysis suggests that this is an
independent and species-specific duplication (Figure 4b).
It is interesting to note that in A. thaliana, the duplication
of both enzyme subunits was not accompanied by REP
duplication.
The most striking observation is that few branches of the
tree of life are characterized by the presence of a larger
insert region between SCR1B and SCR2 in REPs. Their size
indicates that few independent taxa display inserts that are
larger than those of yeast MRS6 (yeast REP) and RabGDIs
(Figure 4C). At the sequence level there is no real conservation – the inserts are similar within taxa but very different across taxa. Systematic database searches using solely
the insert regions from several specie can only find closely
related REP sequences. For example, a BLAST search using
the insert region of rat or human REP1 will find only deuterostomes REP inserts, but not plant inserts, and vice
versa. They are also not similar to any other protein other
than REPs, which means that we cannot use this approach
to define hypothetical functions for this region.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/140

In the crystal structure of rat REP1, this sequence insert
corresponds to a region in the crystal with no clear electron density [29]. Such regions are typically labeled
natively unfolded [46,47]. Natively unfolded proteins are
involved in a variety of cellular functions, namely transcriptional and translational regulation, signaling and regulation of the self-assembly of large multi-subunit
complexes such as the ribosome and the bacterial flagellum [47,48]. They are also expected to be involved in a
variety of human diseases [49]. Although they can perform their function in the unfolded state, the majority of
unfolded regions undergo a process termed induced-folding, in which upon binding to their physiological partners
they undergo a transition to a structured form [50]. We
tested whether the different inserts were also natively
unfolded, using the predictive algorithm Globplot2 [51].
We observed that angiosperm insert sequences are predicted to include a disordered, region, so are all vertebrate
sequences and nematodes. In contrast, insects never show
a predicted disordered region within the insert region
(Figure 4C and S5). Thus, the presence of disordered
regions is not restricted to the larger inserts of vertebrates,
nor does it seem to correlate with insert size.
Duplications
In most species studied, we find a single copy of the αand the β-subunit. In contrast we found two RGGTase αand β-subunits in A. thaliana. We have previously
observed that duplication of whole protein complexes is
frequent [16]. We argued for the prevalence of stepwise
duplications leading to complete duplication of subunits
of complexes, like what is observed with the adaptin tetrameric complexes [52]. The duplication of the two subunits of RGGTase in A. thaliana however appears to have
occurred simultaneously, as a result of a whole genome
duplication (WGD) estimated to have happened around
38 million years ago [53]. The paralogous pairs localize to
distinct chromosomes, to duplicated segments that were
mapped to that WGD (α-subunit: At4g2424490 (chr.4)
and At5g41820 (chr.5); β-subunit: At3g12070 (chr.3) and
At5g12210 (chr.5)).

The functional relevance of maintaining these two copies
of RGGTase is unclear. It is clear from all the phylogenetic
trees that the subunits are very closely related (e.g. Figure
S1), suggesting some selective pressure. A. thaliana may
require high levels of this enzyme and concerted gene
duplication is one way of boosting the levels of a given
gene product [54]. Alternatively, the large number and
diversity of Rab GTPases in A. thaliana [55,56] may
require specific regulation of Rab prenylation. This could
be achieved by having multiple copies of the enzyme subunits under differential regulation or displaying distinct
substrate specificities.

Animals also display an expansion of the Rab family. They
don't have multiple copies of the enzyme subunits; they
have instead two paralogous REPs that appear to form
complexes with distinct substrates and have distinct specificities to the RGGTase [57]. This lends some support to
the second hypothesis. It would be thus interesting to
investigate whether there is specificity in the pairing of the
A. thaliana subunits, and whether the different versions of
the enzyme have distinct substrate specificities. In contrast, some animals display two or more copies of the βsubunit for a single α-subunit (Figure 2). Since substratebinding specificity is not defined by the β-subunit in RabGGTase, it seems plausible that expression levels are at the
root of these duplications. Amoebozoa like D. discoideum,
which represents another example of independent expansions of the Rab family, have in excess of 50 Rab proteins
(unpublished observations). D. discoideum only has one
copy of each component (Figure 2), indicating that large
Rab families are compatible with a single copy of each
RabGGTase component.
The duplication of components of RabGGTase appear
thus to be restricted to specific branches of the tree of life
(Figure 2). Our analysis also indicates that it is also
restricted to RabGGTase. We did not observe duplications
of FTase nor GGTase I subunits. This is despite the fact that
their substrates show expansions akin to those of the Rab
family. For example, the Ras and Rho families expanded
from 3 and 6 members respectively in S. cerevisiae, to 22
and 34, respectively, in H. sapiens [58]. It is possible that
dosage balance may place a barrier to duplications of subunits [18,59].

Conclusion
In summary, we identified the orthologues of the components of the Rab prenylation complex in 43 species – the
αβ heterodimer RabGGTase, and the accessory proteins
REP. We characterized their domain architectures and
found that it varies considerably in evolution. The α-subunit can have distinct inserts in two positions, between
the tetratricopeptide repeats 5 and 6 and at the C-terminal. These domain insertions are specific to RabGGTase,
as the paralogous α-subunit of Farnesyl and Geranylgeranyl (type I) Transferases displays conserved domain architectures. The β subunit has a conserved domain
architecture but the REP proteins also have variable inserts
between SCR1B and SCR2.
We found the full constellation of protein prenyltransferases in the organisms we analyzed as found in model
organisms [1,2]. This suggests that the Last Common
Eukaryotic Ancestor (L.E.C.A.) had the same constellation
of enzymes and subunits. The three enzymes are related
by gene duplication events, which suggests that there was
an ancestral heterodimeric protein prenyl transferase at

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/140

the base of the eukaryotic tree. The presence of structural
homologues of α and β-subunits in all the branches of the
tree of life indicates that the eukaryotic innovation
required solely novel interactions, rather than novel folds.
The precise order of duplication events is however
unclear. FTase and GGTase I are separated by a single gene
duplication event, whereas RGGTase is separated by two
duplication events from either of the other enzymes. The
simpler architecture of FTase and GGTase I, and their
independence from further components for proper activity suggests that they preceded RGGTase. However, substrates of all three enzymes are ubiquitous in the
eukaryotic tree, which further emphasizes that the
L.E.C.A. is likely to have already the three enzymes.
In conclusion, the components of the Rab prenylation
complex display varied domain architectures in evolution, which are more consistent with multiple independent events in the first insertion of the α-subunit, multiple
losses in the second insert, and independent expansions
in REP. There is no known function for the variable
domains. There is no obvious correlation between Rab
family size, and the presence or size of any of the RGGTase
inserts, which suggests that these insertions are independent of Rab family expansion. Furthermore, the inserted
domains do not parallel each other within or across subunits. This indicates that it is unlikely that they are
involved in direct physical contacts, and that they are
likely to have independent functions. The few inserted
sequences that are similar to known sequences (C2-like
and LRR) suggest that the role of these domains is regulatory, possibly involving lipid and protein binding. It is
tempting to speculate that they are involved in taxon-specific regulatory interactions not yet described. One future
avenue of research will be the identification of putative
binding partners, for example by bioinformatic analysis,
searching for genes with similar phylogenetic profiles as
those of the inserted domains.
Finally, this case study suggests that domain gains and
losses may be an important force driving the evolution
and diversification of protein complexes. A future avenue
of research is the quantification of this contribution.

Methods
The analyses were performed on sequenced eukaryotic
genomes that were downloaded from NCBI and other
eukaryotic genomes databases. A full listing of the organisms investigated is provided in additional file 1. It aims
for maximum coverage of eukaryotic diversity within the
species with a complete genome sequence. Sequence
searches combined BLAST [35] searches using known
RGGTase and REP sequences as query, as well as protein
families defined in the Pfam [36] and superfamily [37,38]
databases. Multiple sequence alignments were performed

with ClustalW 1.83 [60], pairwise alignments used the
Smith-Waterman algorithm [61] (Water in EMBOSS
[62]), in both cases with the a Blosum 62 matrix [63] and
default GAP and extension penalties. Sequence manipulation was done with Jalview 2.1.1 [64]. Domain assignments were done using Superfamily [65] and Pfam [66].
Secondary structure predictions was performed using
Jpred [39,40]. Phylogenetic reconstruction was done
using the Neighbor-Joining clustering algorithm as implemented in ClustalW 1.83 [60], using 1000 bootstraps, as
well as the cladistic methods Maximum Likelihood in the
Phylip 3.61 package (ProML) [67] (Jones-Taylor-Thorthon (JTT) matrix; 100 boostraps) and Bayesian method
implemented in MrBayes v. 3.1.2 [68,69] using Blosum62
as a fixed rate aa model, ran until average standard deviation of split frequencies was lower than 0.01. Trees were
drawn using in FigTree v. 1.0 [70].
All sequences used in this study, as well as alignment and
tree files can be found in the supplementary website [71].
