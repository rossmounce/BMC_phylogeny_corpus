From The Ninth Asia Pacific Bioinformatics Conference (APBC 2011)
Inchon, Korea. 11-14 January 2011

The Asia Pacific Bioinformatics Conference (APBC) is a
leading conference in the Bioinformatics community
and has grown rapidly since its inception in 2003. The
goal of the annual conference series is to enable high
quality interaction on bioinformatics research.
The past APBC conferences were held in:
1. APBC2003 4-7 Feb 2003: Adelaide Australia
2. APBC2004 18-22 Jan 2004: Dunedin, New Zealand
3. APBC2005 17-21 Jan 2005: Singapore
4. APBC2006 13-16 Feb, 2006: Taipei Taiwan
5. APBC2007 15-17 Jan, 2007: Hong Kong
6. APBC2008 14-17 Jan, 2008: Kyoto Japan
7. APBC2009 13-16 Jan, 2009: Beijing China
8. APBC2010 18-21 Jan, 2010: Bangalore India
The Ninth Asia Pacific Bioinformatics Conference
(APBC2011) was held in Incheon, South Korea, the first
time in this dynamic country. The conference spanning
the dates of the 11 th to the 14 th of January brought
together more than 300 researchers, professional, industry leaders and students from all over the globe. The
participants came from institutions in the following 19
countries and regions (in alphabetical order): Australia,
Bangladesh, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany,
India, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, Singapore,
South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, UK and
USA. The conference program included 6 keynote
speakers (Drs. Steven Jones, Luonan Chen, Peer Bork,
Sang Yup Lee, Hong Gil Nam and Kenta Nakai), 55
selected talks, 8 tutorials and more than 118 posters.
The titles of the keynote talks are:
• Steven Jones, “Bioinformatics and Cancer Genomics”
• Luonan Chen, “Modeling and Analyzing Nonlinear
Biomolecular Networks”

Full list of author information is available at the end of the article

• Peer Bork, “Systemic analysis of the human gut: connecting chemicals, proteins, cells, communities and
phenotypes”
• Sang Yup Lee, “Systems metabolic engineering”
• Hong Gil Nam, “Understanding and controlling
plant growth and development: Genetic, Systems, and
chemical genomic approaches”
• Kenta Nakai, “Information for Transcriptional
Regulation”
The tutorial topics for APBC2011 included WebLab: a
web-based bioinformatics platform (Jingchu Luo), Promenade through the web programming for biological
research using Perl language (Kyung-Hoon Kwon),
Bioinformatics analysis of genome & exome by next generation sequencing (Namshim Kim), Probabilistic Models
for Multiple Motif Discovery (Jong Kyoung), Molecular
Modeling: Analysis of Protein Structure and Function
(Jinhyuk Lee), OASIS: Traditional Korean Medicine
Information Portal (Sang-Jun Yea), Information Retrieval
and Text Mining Opportunities in Bioinformatics (Jeyakumar Natarajan) and Bioworks: Bioinformation Analysis
Pipeline (Seungyoon Nam and Youngmahn Hahn).
The emphasis of APBC has been algorithmic development and innovation in Bioinformatics and this year
that theme continued. Reflecting the ever-changing nature of Bioinformatics and is adaption to advances in
technology, for the first time, a session was held on
next-generation sequencing. A wide range of topics in
Bioinformatics were covered at the conference and were
categorised as:
• Phylogenetics and Evolution
• Molecular binding and modelling
• Genome Sequencing and Assembly
• Network and system biology
• Structural Bioinformatics
• Pathway analysis
• Proteomics

• Pattern Recognition and Statistical Inference
• Structure and data modelling
• Translational bioinformatics
• Bioinformatics databases and applications
In 2011, APBC received a substantial number of submissions from a diverse range of countries from Belgium
to Brazil. Participants in the 2011 APBC came from
every continent with the exception of Africa, however
actual participants may represent geographies outside of
their institutions. Submissions have come from institutions in a wide range of countries including (alphabetically): Australia, Bangladesh, Belgium, Brazil, Canada,
China, Germany, India, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Saudi
Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan,
Thailand, UK and USA.
The APBC2011 conference has received 164 submissions covering a wide range of topics in bioinformatics.
The conferences’ scope was wide in order to adapt itself
quickly to this progressive research field. The broad
composition of the expert program committee was well
equipped to handle the diversity of topics under the
banner of bioinformatics and computational biology. Of
the 164 submitted papers, 153 received two or more
peer reviews with an acceptance rate of 33%. We wish
to thank and acknowledge the Program Committee
members and their contributions. The Program Committee members are:
