Abstract
Background: Pneumonia and myocarditis are the most commonly reported diseases due to Histophilus somni, an
opportunistic pathogen of the reproductive and respiratory tracts of cattle. Thus far only a few genes involved in
metabolic and virulence functions have been identified and characterized in H. somni using traditional methods.
Analyses of the genome sequences of several Pasteurellaceae species have provided insights into their biology and
evolution. In view of the economic and ecological importance of H. somni, the genome sequence of pneumonia
strain 2336 has been determined and compared to that of commensal strain 129Pt and other members of the
Pasteurellaceae.
Results: The chromosome of strain 2336 (2,263,857 bp) contained 1,980 protein coding genes, whereas the
chromosome of strain 129Pt (2,007,700 bp) contained only 1,792 protein coding genes. Although the
chromosomes of the two strains differ in size, their average GC content, gene density (total number of genes
predicted on the chromosome), and percentage of sequence (number of genes) that encodes proteins were
similar. The chromosomes of these strains also contained a number of discrete prophage regions and genomic
islands. One of the genomic islands in strain 2336 contained genes putatively involved in copper, zinc, and
tetracycline resistance. Using the genome sequence data and comparative analyses with other members of the
Pasteurellaceae, several H. somni genes that may encode proteins involved in virulence (e.g., filamentous
haemaggutinins, adhesins, and polysaccharide biosynthesis/modification enzymes) were identified. The two strains
contained a total of 17 ORFs that encode putative glycosyltransferases and some of these ORFs had characteristic
simple sequence repeats within them. Most of the genes/loci common to both the strains were located in
different regions of the two chromosomes and occurred in opposite orientations, indicating genome
rearrangement since their divergence from a common ancestor.
Conclusions: Since the genome of strain 129Pt was ~256,000 bp smaller than that of strain 2336, these genomes
provide yet another paradigm for studying evolutionary gene loss and/or gain in regard to virulence repertoire and
pathogenic ability. Analyses of the complete genome sequences revealed that bacteriophage- and transposonmediated horizontal gene transfer had occurred at several loci in the chromosomes of strains 2336 and 129Pt. It
appears that these mobile genetic elements have played a major role in creating genomic diversity and
phenotypic variability among the two H. somni strains.

Background
Histophilus somni is a commensal or opportunistic pathogen of the reproductive and respiratory tracts of cattle.
H. somni was initially identified as the etiologic agent of
bovine thrombotic meningoencephalitis (TME), but also
causes bovine shipping fever pneumonia, either independently or in association with Mannheimia haemolytica
and Pasteurella multocida. Pneumonia and myocarditis
are currently the most commonly reported diseases due to
H. somni [1]. Infections resulting in abortion, infertility,
arthritis, septicemia, and mastitis can also be caused by
H. somni with varying degrees of frequency and severity in
cattle [2]. Similar disease conditions associated with strains
of H. somni have been described in sheep [2]. Relatively
less pathogenic and/or avirulent variants of H. somni have
also been isolated from cattle, most frequently from the
mucosal surfaces of the genital tract [3].
Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies during the pregenomic era have shed light on the differences in virulence
properties between H. somni pathogenic isolates from sick
animals and serum-sensitive commensal isolates from the
genital tract [4]. However, thus far only a few genes
involved in lipooligosaccharide (LOS) biosynthesis
and serum-resistance have been identified in H. somni
using DNA/DNA and DNA/protein comparisons [5-7].
H. somni pneumonia strain 2336 and preputial strain
129Pt have been comprehensively characterized phenotypically and have been analyzed in several comparative studies [8-10]. However, a comprehensive understanding of
the genetic basis that determines the phenotypic variability
among H. somni stains is necessary to gain further insights
into their pathogenicity.
Comparative (in silico) analysis of bacterial genomes is a
powerful tool for the prediction and/or identification of
biochemical differences, virulence attributes, pathogenic
ability, and adaptive evolution among related species/
strains [11]. Among the Pasteurellaceae, the genomes of
one or more species pathogenic to humans or animals
from the genera Actinobacillus, Haemophilus, Mannheimia, Pasteurella, and others have been sequenced. The
availability of these genome sequences has facilitated
whole genome comparisons that have provided insights
into the physiology and pathogenic evolution of the corresponding bacteria [12,13].
Horizontal gene transfer (HGT: defined as the “acquisition of new genes either directly by transformation with
naked DNA, transduction with phages, or the uptake of
plasmids or chromosomal fragments by conjugation”)
plays a critical role in driving the evolution of pathogenic
bacteria [14]. Reduction in genome size (referred to as
reductive evolution) can occur as a result of continuous
loss of genetic material due to gene deletion and/or mutation followed by DNA erosion [15]. Previous analyses by

Page 2 of 20

biochemical and pulsed field gel electrophoresis indicated
that H. somni strains 2336 and 129Pt have common ancestry, but are non-clonal [16,17]. The following mechanisms
may have engendered the genetic differences between
these strains: (i) only one strain acquired genes by HGT
while the other one did not; (ii) only one strain lost genes
by deletion/mutation and underwent ‘reductive evolution’;
(iii) both strains independently and continuously acquired
and lost genes, and the net loss or gain of genes is a determinant of their divergent evolution; (iv) gene convergence
and the accumulation of synonymous and/or nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions occurred across the genomes of the two strains.
The rationale for the present study was to determine,
using whole genome sequencing and comparative genomics, the mechanisms responsible for genetic variability
between the two strains. It was also envisaged that a comparative genomics and bioinformatics approach would
facilitate identification of H. somni genes putatively
involved in virulence and pathogenesis.

Methods
Genomic DNA (2 mg) from H. somni strain 2336 was purified using the Puregene protocol (Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, MN). The shotgun sequencing phase for this
genome required ~35,200 sequence reads to reach 8-fold
coverage [18]. Library construction, template preparation,
sequencing, assembly, and data analyses were performed
as described previously [19,20]. The sequence data
assembled with Phred-Phrap were viewed using Consed to
assess data quality and design closure experiments.
Consed was also used to identify putative repeat regions
so that the problems associated with assembling these
regions could be resolved by way of combinatorial PCR
experiments to isolate the repeat sequences on PCR amplicons. The location and exact sequence of each repeat was
confirmed by isolating PCR fragments that contained each
repeat in its entirety, followed by primer walking across
the PCR product.
For initial gap closure, Single Primer Amplification of
Contig Ends (SPACE), which is similar to the single-primer PCR procedure for rapid identification of transposon
insertion sites, was used [21]. Additional primers were
designed, as necessary, to verify the correct assembly of
contigs by confirmatory PCR. Simultaneously, a fosmid
library was constructed for scaffolding purposes using the
vector pCC1fos (Epicentre Biotechnologies, Madison, WI)
with 40 kb inserts. Sequencing of the fosmids was necessary to close gaps across sequences that occur more than
once in the genome, such as those of insertion sequences
and ribosomal genes. Gaps that were not closed by
SPACE-walking were closed using the sequence of
H. somni strain 129Pt as a scaffold and the reads were

Siddaramappa et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:570
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/570

assembled with parallel phrap (High Performance Software, LLC). Gap closure at this stage was also facilitated
by AUTOFINISH [22]. Possible mis-assemblies were corrected with Dupfinisher [23] or transposon bombing of
bridging clones [24] using an EZ::TN™ kit (Epicentre).
The National Human Genome Research Institute standards for the Human Genome Project (1 error per 10, 000
assembled bases) were followed for H. somni to obtain sufficient quality genomic data.
Final automated annotation of the genome of strain
2336 was performed at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory
using methods similar to those used to annotate the strain
129Pt genome [13]. Briefly, protein domains were identified by comparing each predicted protein against a Hidden
Markov Model protein family database [25]. To estimate
the number of proteins specific to each strain, the SmithWaterman algorithm [26] was used to compare all predicted proteins from strain 129Pt against those from strain
2336 and vice-versa. Proteins deemed to be specific to
each strain were compared against the NCBI non-redundant protein database to determine whether they were
hypothetical or conserved hypothetical. The translated
ORF was named a hypothetical protein if there was less
than 25% identity or an aligned region was less than 25%
of the predicted protein length. Prediction of the number
of subsystems and pairwise BLAST comparisons of protein
sets within strains 2336 and 129Pt were carried out with
the Rapid Annotation using Subsystems Technology
(RAST), which is a fully automated, prokaryotic genome
annotation service [27]. This platform identifies tRNA and
rRNA genes using the tools tRNAscan-SE and “search_
for_rnas”, respectively [27].
Multiple genome comparisons were performed using
the ‘progressive alignment’ option available in the program MAUVE version 2.3.0 [28,29]. Default scoring and
parameters were used for generating the alignment. A
synteny plot was generated using the program NUCmer,
which creates a dot plot based on the number of identical alignments between two genomes [30]. Prophage
regions (PRs) were identified using Prophinder http://
aclame.ulb.ac.be/Tools/Prophinder/, an algorithm that
combines similarity searches, statistical detection of
phage-gene enriched regions, and genomic context for
prophage prediction [31]. Identification and annotation
of genomic islets/islands (GIs) other than prophages
were performed based on sequence composition bias
and comparative genomic analysis [32]. Briefly, differences in the GC content, the occurrence of ‘cornerstone
genes’ (e.g., transposases), and/or a continuous stretch of
genes encoding hypothetical proteins were used as reference points for detection of GIs. Insertion sequences
(ISs) were identified by whole genome BLASTX analysis
of strains 2336 and 129Pt using the IS finder http://

Page 3 of 20

www-is.biotoul.fr/. Gene acquisition and loss among the
two strains was determined by comparing gene order,
orientation of genes (forward/reverse), GC content of
genes (percent above or below whole genome average),
features of intergenic regions (e.g., remnants of IS elements, integration sites), and the similarity of proteins
encoded by genes at a locus of interest (> 90% identity
at the predicted protein level). Putative horizontally
transferred genes (HTGs; defined as genes whose greatest homology, based on BLASTP scores, is to genes
from a more distant phylogenetic group than to genes
from the same or a close phylogenetic group as the
query genome) were compiled using the integrated
microbial genomes (IMG) system http://img.jgi.doe.gov.
This system uses not only the best hit (i.e., the homolog
with the highest bitscore), but also all the matches that
have bitscores equal to or greater than that of the best
hit to identify putative HTGs [33]. DNA and protein
sequences were aligned using the ClustalW http://www.
ebi.ac.uk/Tools/clustalw2/index.html and BOXSHADE
http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/BOX_form.html
programs as described previously [34].

Results
Properties of the chromosomes

The size of the H. somni strain 2336 chromosome was
2,263,857 bp, and was larger than the chromosomes of the
related bacteria Haemophilus ducreyi strain 35000HP
(1,698,955 bp), Haemophilus influenzae strain Rd KW20
(1,830,138 bp), H. influenzae strain 86-028NP (1,913,428
bp), H. somni strain 129Pt (2,007,700 bp), Neisseria gonorrhoeae strain FA 1090 (2,153,922 bp), Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A strain Z2491 (2,184,406 bp), and
P. multocida strain Pm70 (2,257,487 bp). However, the
chromosome of H. somni strain 2336 was smaller than
that of Haemophilus parasuis SH0165 (2,269,156 bp),
N. meningitidis serogroup B strain MC58 (2,272,360 bp),
Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae L20 (2,274,482 bp),
Aggregatibacter aphrophilus NJ8700 (2,313,035 bp), Mannheimia succiniciproducens strain MBEL55E (2,314,078
bp), and M. haemolytica strain BAA-410 (~2,569,125 bp,
draft sequence). Although the chromosomes of the two
H. somni strains differ in size by ~256,000 bp, their average GC content, gene density (total number of genes predicted on the chromosome), and percentage of the
sequence (number of genes) that encodes proteins were
similar (Table 1). H. somni strain 2336 did not contain
plasmids, but H. somni strain 129Pt contained a single
plasmid [34]. Some of the other relevant features of the
chromosomes of H. somni strains 2336 and 129Pt are
shown in Table 1.
Whole genome alignment using MAUVE showed the
presence of extensive blocks of homologous regions,

which is typical of closely related genomes (Figure 1). To
further dissect their co-linearity, a BLASTN comparison
of the two genomes was performed at the Joint Genome
Institute web site. This analysis indicated that there were
400 homologous regions (219 plus/plus and 181 plus/
minus, sequence range > 1,000 bp, but < 30,000 bp) and
the average nucleic acid identity among these homologous regions was 98.5% (the identity range was 94%-99%,
E-value = 0). The plus/plus homologous regions refer to
those present on the forward strand in both strains (i.e.,
those that have the same orientation in both the chromosomes), and the plus/minus homologous regions refer to
those present on the reverse strand in strain 129Pt in
relation to those present on the forward strand in strain
2336 (i.e., those that have the opposite orientation, indicative of chromosome inversion). Several large gaps,
translocations, and inversions became visible in the alignment generated by NUCmer (Figure 2). Detailed
sequence examination revealed that some of these gaps
and/or inversions were associated with integrative and
conjugative elements.

Comparison of prophage regions and genomic islands

Prophinder predicted four PRs in strain 2336, but only one
in strain 129Pt (Table 2). PR I of strain 2336 was the
shortest and had homology to 3 segments totaling ~4,000
bp of bacteriophage HP1 of H. influenzae (66-68% nucleotide identity, E-value = 0 to 4e-07). The GC content of all
four PRs from strain 2336 (PR I, 40.23%; PR II, 43.95%; PR
III, 39.63%; PR IV, 39.85%) was higher than that of the
overall genome (37.38% GC). PR II of strain 2336, which
had the highest GC content (43.95%) among the four PRs,
also contained a 5,679 bp segment (774,075 bp to 779,754
bp) with homology to a region within the genome of H.
influenzae strain 10810 (72% nucleotide identity, E-value =
0). PR III of strain 2336 was the longest and contained 38
ORFs of unknown function (annotated as encoding
hypothetical proteins). The genome of H. parasuis strain
SH0165 contained several short sequences that had
homology to this region (e.g., 5 segments totaling ~2,700
bp in the 1,136,975 bp to 1,143,731 bp region, 69-76%
nucleotide identity, E-value = 5e-152 to 7e-11). PR IV of
strain 2336 was the most conspicuous and contained at

locally collinear blocks (LCBs), depict homologous regions in the two chromosomes. The edges of LCBs indicate chromosome rearrangements
due to recombination, insertions, and/or inversions. Sequences of strain 129Pt inverted in relation to those of strain 2336 are shown as blocks

to 1,725,687 bp region, 67-84% nucleotide identity,
E-value = 3e-126 to 1e-05). Furthermore, the P2 family
lysogenic bacteriophage phi-MhaA1-PHL101 from

M. haemolytica serotype A1 contained some of the ORFs
found within PR IV of strain 2336.
PR I of strain 129Pt was 6,361 bp shorter than PR III of
strain 2336, but the two PRs had a similar GC content. A
BLASTN analysis indicated that a sequence of ~20,000 bp
was conserved between PR I of strain 129Pt and PR III of
strain 2336 (96-99% nucleotide identity, E-value = 0).

A two-way comparison indicated that an 11,525 bp segment (1,006,964 bp to 1,018,488 bp, 37.38% GC) within
PR III, and a 1,255 bp segment from the 5’ side of PR III
of strain 2336 were absent in strain 129Pt (Figure 3A). A
similar comparison indicated that a 5,740 bp segment
(1,595,978 bp to 1,601,717 bp, 35.47% GC) within PR I,
and a 2,192 bp segment from the 3’ side of PR I, of strain
129Pt were absent in strain 2336 (Figure 3B). Bacteriophages within the Prophinder database containing some of
the predicted ORFs from PRs I-IV of strain 2336 and PR I
of strain 129Pt are shown in Figure 4.
Manual curation indicated that strains 2336 and 129Pt
contained 3 and 6 GIs, comprising a total of 72,709 bp
and 36,947 bp, respectively (Table 2). GI I of strain 2336
contained 17 ORFs of unknown function and a similar
sequence was not found in strain 129Pt or other members
of the Pasteurellaceae. GI II of strain 2336 was the longest,
had a higher GC content (~43%) than the overall genome,
and contained 16 ORFs of unknown function. The genome of P. multocida strain Pm70 contained several short
sequences that had homology to this region (e.g., 3 segments totaling 5,433 bp in the 2,174,533 bp to 2,187,234
bp region, 82-99% nucleotide identity, E-value = 0). GI III
of strain 2336 contained 4 ORFs encoding putative transposases ([GenBank:HSM_1871, [GenBank:HSM_1874,
[GenBank:HSM_1883, and [GenBank:HSM_1887] and 8
ORFs of unknown function. Strain 129Pt lacked an analogous GI, but contained homologs of the genes encoding
putative transposases. A 4,640 bp sequence from Escherichia coli strain 49 [GenBank:U23723] had homology to GI
III of strain 2336 (72% identity across 3,270 bp, E-value =
0).
GI I of strain 129Pt contained an ORF encoding a resolvase/integrase-like protein [GenBank:HS_0445] and 6
ORFs of unknown function. A similar sequence was not
found in strain 2336, but H. parasuis strain SH0165 contained several short sequences with homology to this
region (e.g., 3 segments totaling 2,040 bp, 68-79% nucleotide identity, E-values = 0 to 1e-06). GI II of strain 129Pt
contained an ORF encoding a putative phage DNA primase-like protein [GenBank:HS_0533] and 9 ORFs of

Page 6 of 20

unknown function. A similar sequence was not found in
strain 2336 or other members of the Pasteurellaceae. GI
III of strain 129Pt contained ORFs encoding a putative
phage terminase protein [GenBank:HS_1334], a prophage
regulatory element [GenBank:HS_1335], an integrase
[GenBank:HS_1337], and 4 ORFs of unknown function. A
similar sequence was not found in strain 2336, but Aggregatibacter aphrophilus strain NJ8700 contained several
short sequences that had homology to this region (e.g., 2
segments totaling 1,334 bp in the 1,818,930 bp to
1,821,098 bp region, 74-80% nucleotide identity, E-values
= 0 to 4e-35). All predicted ORFs from GIs IV and V of
strain 129Pt were of unknown function and strain 2336
contained several short sequences that had homology to
these regions (e.g., 7 segments totaling 2,184 bp in the
1,965,862 bp to 1,990,890 bp region of GI II, 67-92%
nucleotide identity, E-values = 9e-42 to 1e-10). The chromosome of strain 2336 had no regions of homology to GI
VI of strain 129Pt, but H. parasuis strain SH0165 contained several short sequences that had homology to this
region (e.g., 3 segments totaling 1,573 bp, 68% nucleotide
identity, E-values = 2e-51 to 2e-13).
Comparison of insertion sequences

Insertion sequence finder indicated that strains 2336 and
129Pt contained several IS elements distributed throughout the chromosomes. Not surprisingly, some of these IS
elements were found within the PRs and/or GIs
described above. Insertion sequence 1016 (IS1016), consisting of a transposase [217 amino acids (aa)] flanked by
18-29 bp of terminal inverted repeats, is a member of the
IS1595 superfamily [35,36]. Strain 2336 contained 4 fulllength ([GenBank:HSM_0851], [GenBank:HSM_1211],

appeared to be interrupted due to an insertion-excision
event involving IS1016, since two partial homologs of the
transposase gene occurred upstream of licA.
Strain 2336 contained 4 full-length members of the
family IS200/IS605 ([GenBank:HSM_0223] was near PR I
and [GenBank:HSM_1626] and [GenBank:HSM_1631]
were near GI I). Strain 129Pt contained 3 full-length ([GenBank:HS_0486], [GenBank:HS_0583], and [GenBank:
HS_1390]) and 6 truncated ([GenBank:HS_0224], [GenBank:HS_0666], [GenBank:HS_0667], [GenBank:HS_0668],
[GenBank:HS_0716], and [GenBank:HS_0717]) members
of the family IS200/IS605. PR I of strain 129Pt included
[GenBank:HS_1390]. Strain 2336 contained a full-length
member of the family IS30 ([GenBank:HSM_1680]) and a
truncated member of the family IS1182/IS5 ([GenBank:
HSM_1887]). Strain 2336 contained a full-length member
of the family IS481 ([GenBank:HSM_0451]), whereas strain
129Pt contained a truncated copy of the same ORF ([GenBank:HS_1518]). Strain 2336 also contained truncated
members of the family IS3 ([GenBank:HSM_0531] and
[GenBank:HSM_0532]). The closest homologs of H. somni
IS200/IS605 and IS1595 elements were found in M. haemolytica (e.g., [GenBank:MHA_0340], 92% identity, E-value

= 0) and H. influenzae (e.g., [GenBank:CGSHiII_08436],
86% identity, E-value = 0). However, the closest homologs
of the IS30 element from strain 2336 were found in A.
pleuropneumoniae (e.g., [GenBank:APP7_0397], 99% identity, E-value = 0) and H. parasuis (e.g., [GenBank:
HAPS_1772], 99% identity, E-value = 8e-180).
BLAST comparison of protein sets

Strains 2336 and 129Pt contained 1550 predicted protein coding genes in common (bidirectional best hits,
at least 90% identity at the predicted protein level). In
strain 2336, 440 ORFs could not be assigned a function based on BLAST analysis and were therefore
annotated as encoding hypothetical or conserved
hypothetical proteins. In strain 129Pt, 429 ORFs were
annotated as encoding hypothetical or conserved
hypothetical proteins. Among hypothetical proteins
that were common to both strains, 30 did not have
homologs outside the genus. Pairwise BLAST comparisons indicated that strain 2336 contained 311 putative
protein coding genes with no homologs in strain
129Pt (additional file 1). Within this subset, proteins
encoded by 302 genes had at least 51 aa and 9 genes
([GenBank:HSM_0528],
[GenBank:HSM_0530],

HSM_1636], [GenBank:HSM_1742], and [GenBank:
HSM_1743]) had 38-50 aa. Strain 129Pt contained 165
putative protein coding genes with no homologs in
strain 2336 (additional file 2). Within this subset, proteins encoded by all 165 genes had at least 51 aa.
In both strains, a vast majority of putative HTGs
appeared to have had their origins among members of
gammaproteobacteria (mostly within Pasteurellales and
Enterobacteriales). Putative HTGs with possible origins
among members of betaproteobacteria (27 in strain 2336,
11 in strain 129Pt) and alphaproteobacteria (1 in strain
2336, 6 in strain 129Pt) were also identified. Among
HTGs identified were those encoding proteins putatively
involved in virulence (e.g., filamentous hemagglutinins,
proteases, and antibiotic resistance regulators). A complete list of these genes is available at the ‘Organism
Details’ sections for strains 2336 and 129Pt within IMG.
Other strain-specific genes identified encoded DNA
methylases (7 in strain 2336, none in strain 129Pt), transposases (8 in strain 2336, 1 in strain 129Pt), ABC transporters (5 in strain 2336, none in strain 129Pt), ATPases
(4 in strain 2336, none in strain 129Pt), transcriptional
regulators (14 in strain 2336, 3 in strain 129Pt), kinases
(2 in strain 2336, 1 in strain 129Pt), and several proteins
related to bacteriophage functions (e.g., of the 10 integrase/resolvase-related genes found in strain 129Pt, six
have no homologs in strain 2336 and of the 7 integrase/
resolvase-related genes found in strain 2336, 2 have no
homologs in strain 129Pt). Excluding intergenic regions,
the total length of sequence that was associated with specific genes in strain 2336 was 254,052 bp (~11% of the
genome), and was 98,016 bp (~5% of the genome) in specific genes of strain 129Pt.
Identification of genes encoding polysaccharide
biosynthesis/modification enzymes

A search of the NCBI non-redundant protein database
using the BLASTP algorithm identified 17 ORFs that
encode putative glycosyltransferases (GTs) in the genomes of strains 2336 and 129Pt. Seven of these ORFs
were common to both genomes (at least 96% identity at
the predicted protein level), 8 were found only in strain
2336, and 2 were found only in strain 129Pt. Among the
ORFs encoding putative GTs common to both strains, 5
contained simple sequence repeats (SSRs), and 4 of the 8
ORFs encoding GTs found in strain 2336 contained
SSRs. A list of putative GTs and their SSRs identified in
both strains are shown in Table 3. Among the ORFs that
encode putative GTs in H. somni strains, three ([GenBank:HSM_0148/HS_0275], [GenBank:HSM_0856], and
[GenBank:HSM_1552/HS_1067]) had no homologs
among other members of the Pasteurellaceae and six

([GenBank:HS_0636], [GenBank:HSM_0975], [GenBank:
HSM_0977], [GenBank:HSM_0978], [GenBank:HSM_
1426], and [GenBank:HSM_1794]) had distant homologs
(< 50% identity) among other members of the Pasteurellaceae (Table 3). These ORFs were annotated based on
their location on the chromosome (e.g., the [GenBank:
HSM_0975-0979] cluster), comparative analyses using
the Swiss-Prot database (e.g., [GenBank:HSM_0148],
[GenBank:HSM_0856], and [GenBank:HSM_1552]), and
their homology to genes encoding putative GTs in nonPasteurellaceae genomes (e.g., [GenBank:HS_0636],
[GenBank:HSM_1426], and [GenBank:HSM_1794]).
The lipooligosaccharide biosynthesis (lob) gene cluster
consisting of lob1 and lob2ABCD ORFs encoding glycosyltransferases involved in attaching the outer core glycoses
of the LOS was previously identified in strain 738, which
is an LOS phase variant of strain 2336 [5,7]. Strain 129Pt
encoded full-length homologs of lob1 and lob2D, but only
the 5’ ends of lob2A and lob2C and lacked lob2B [13].
Strain 2336 contained full-length homologs of lob1 and
lob2ABC, but a truncated homolog of lob2D (table 3). The
variations in the lob loci in the genomes of strains 2336
and 129Pt correlate with the differences in the structures
of the LOS of these strains, as determined by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry [16,38]. In addition, both
strains contained ORFs encoding a phosphoheptose isomerase ([GenBank:HSM_0840] and [GenBank:HS_1238],
gmhA), D,D-heptose 1,7-bisphosphate phosphatase ([GenBank:HSM_0572] and [GenBank:HS_1532], gmhB), ADPL-glycero-D-mannoheptose-6-epimerase ([GenBank:
HSM_0397] and [GenBank:HS_1613], rfaD), bifunctional
heptose 7-phosphate kinase/heptose 1-phosphate adenyltransferase ([GenBank:HSM_0925] and [GenBank:
HS_0576, rfaE), and bifunctional N-acetylglucosamine-1phosphate uridyltransferase/glucosamine-1-phosphate
acetyltransferase ([GenBank:HSM_0204] and [GenBank:
HS_0333], glmU). These five genes/enzymes were predicted to be involved in LOS core biosynthesis in strains
2336 and 129Pt.
Strain 2336 also contained a locus that encodes proteins
putatively involved in exopolysaccharide (EPS) and/or
LOS biosynthesis ([GenBank:HSM_1061] or csrA, carbon
storage regulator; [GenBank:HSM_1062] or manB phosphomannomutase; [GenBank:HSM_1063] or galU, UTPglucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase). Strain 129Pt
contained a similar locus ([GenBank:HS_1117] to [GenBank:HS_1119]) that had an IS1016 element ([GenBank:
HS_1116], transposase) adjacent to it. Furthermore, both
strains contained ORFs encoding a putative UDP-glucose
4-epimerase ([GenBank:HSM_1256] and [GenBank:HS_
0789], galE), phosphoglucomutase ([GenBank:HSM_1832]
and [GenBank:HS_1670], pgmB), and dTDP-glucose 4,6dehydratase ([GenBank:HSM_1118] and [GenBank:HS_

0707], rmlB). These three genes/enzymes were predicted
to be involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis/modification.
Acquisition and loss of genes encoding filamentous
hemagglutinins

The chromosome of H. somni strain 2336 contained
four loci that have twelve putative genes encoding proteins homologous to FhaB, and four putative genes
encoding proteins homologous to FhaC. Locus I of
strain 2336 was 17,222 bp (GC content of 40%) and
contained genes encoding four FhaB homologs ([GenBank:HSM_0268], [GenBank:HSM_0270], [GenBank:
HSM_0272], and [GenBank:HSM_0274]) and one FhaC
homolog ([GenBank:HSM_0267]). No transposon or
phage sequences were present in this locus. In contrast,
strain 129Pt had a locus containing genes that flanked
locus I of strain 2336, but did not contain the FhaB and
FhaC homologs (Figure 5, locus I). Locus II of strain
2336 was 6,712 bp (GC content of 26%) and contained
genes encoding FhaB ([GenBank:HSM_1090]) and FhaC
([GenBank:HSM_1089]), which appeared to be associated with a transposon. Strain 129Pt had a locus containing genes that flanked locus II of strain 2336, but
did not contain the FhaB and FhaC homologs (Figure 5,
locus II).
Locus III of strain 2336 was 14,066 bp (GC content of
37%) and contained genes encoding FhaB ([GenBank:
HSM_1489]) and FhaC ([GenBank:HSM_1490]). The
fhaB (12,288 bp) of this locus was the second largest
gene in the genome and the largest among the 12 homologs. This gene encoded a putative protein homologous
to the high molecular weight immunoglobulin-binding
protein of H. somni and the large supernatant proteins
(Lsp1 and Lsp2) of H. ducreyi that have been previously
described [39]. No transposon or phage regions were
apparent in this locus. Strain 129Pt had a locus containing genes that flank locus III of strain 2336, but did not
contain the FhaB and FhaC homologs (Figure 5, locus
III). Locus IV of strain 2336 was 21,841 bp (GC content
of 38%) and contained genes encoding six FhaB homologs ([GenBank:HSM_1638], [GenBank:HSM_1641],
[GenBank:HSM_1643], [GenBank:HSM_1646], [GenBank:HSM_1647], [GenBank:HSM_1651]). A truncated
gene encoding FhaC ([GenBank:HSM_1653], 98 aa) was
also found in this locus. A partial homolog of [GenBank:
HSM_1647] was found in strain 129Pt ([GenBank:
HS_0540], 153 aa), which appeared to be the only region
in the chromosome of strain 129Pt with a sequence
related to the fhaB genes (Figure 5, locus IV).
The twelve putative FhaB homologs found in the four
loci of strain 2336 varied in size, with the smallest and
largest being 83 aa and 4,095 aa, respectively. Phylogenetic comparison indicated that the four FhaB homologs
within locus I were most closely related to each other as

Page 10 of 20

were the six FhaB homologs within locus IV (data not
shown). The FhaC homologs of loci I (581 aa) and III
(586 aa) were more closely related to each other than to
FhaC from locus II (450 aa). Multiple sequence alignment of N-terminal fragments of FhaB homologs from
the four loci of strain 2336 with those of Bordetella pertussis FHA and Proteus mirabilis HpmA showed that
they contain several common features (Figure 6). Of the
many residues that are shown to be involved in B. pertussis FHA secretion, 6 (four asparagine and one each of
serine and glutamic acid) were conserved in all six
homologs and 2 (an asparagine and a methionine) were
conserved in five of the homologs (Figure 6). However,
the NPNG (Figure 6, S2) and CXXC (Figure 6, S3)
motifs that may play a role in stabilization of the helical
structure were conserved in only three homologs.
Acquisition of a gene encoding subtilisin-like protease

H. somni strain 2336 GI III contained a gene encoding a
putative subtilisin-like serine protease ([GenBank:
HSM_1889], 730 aa; Figure 5, locus V, arrow (gene) 10). A
BLASTP search revealed that the non-redundant GenBank
database contained several proteins that were homologous
to [GenBank:HSM_1889], with the closest relative being
an E. coli protein ([GenBank:AAA64865], 75% identity, Evalue = 0). The NCBI protein clusters database lists [GenBank:HSM_1889] as one of the 16 members of the [GenBank:CLSK923564] cluster (peptidase S8 and S53,
subtilisin, kexin, sedolisin). Among the proteins of this
cluster, homologs from Ralstonia eutropha JMP134 ([GenBank:Reut_C6419], 45% identity, E-value = 1e-178), Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1 ([GenBank:Pfl01_5697], 35%
identity, E-value = 2e-116), and Pseudomonas syringae pv.
phaseolicola 1448A ([GenBank:PSPPH_0180], 35% identity, E-value = 1e-115) are listed in the prokaryotic subtilase database as subtilases of the D-H-S family.
Genomic comparison of members of the [GenBank:
CLSK923564] cluster revealed that in 3 cases (Arthrobacter
aurescens TC1, R. eutropha JMP134, and Xanthomonas
campestris pv. vesicatoria str. 85-10), the ORF encoding
subtilisin was found on plasmids. In the case of Delftia
acidovorans SPH-1, Burkholderia ambifaria AMMD,
Polaromonas naphthalenivorans CJ2, Chelativorans sp.
BNC1, and E. coli O127:H6 str. E2348/69, the ORF encoding subtilisin was found within a prophage region. Furthermore, in the case of Photorhabdus luminescens subsp.
laumondii TTO1, P. syringae pv. phaseolicola 1448A, P.
fluorescens Pf0-1, Verminephrobacter eiseniae EF01-2, and
Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae PXO99A, the ORF encoding subtilisin appeared to be associated with genes encoding transposases. However, in Chromohalobacter salexigens
DSM 3043 and Anaeromyxobacter sp. K, the ORF encoding subtilisin was not associated with prophage or transposase sequences. Interestingly, in 15 host species the

regions are box-shaded black (identical amino acid residues) and gray (conserved amino acid substitutions). Arrows point to arginine, asparagine,
glutamic acid, methionine, and serine residues that are shown to be involved in FHA secretion. Regions that correspond to the secondary
structural components of FHA and HpmA are marked with a plus sign. S1 (NXXL), S2 (NXXG), and S3 (CXXC) indicate motifs that may be involved
in stabilization of the helical structure of FHA and/or HpmA. Numbers at the end of each sequence denote amino acid positions.

subtilisin ORF formed an operon with an ORF encoding
homologous ATPases of the AAA family. In the case of A.
aurescens TC1, a transposon insertion appears to have disrupted the AAA ATPase-subtilisin operon. The two ORFs
have a 4 bp overlap in 8 species and appear to be co-transcribed (Figure 7, left side). Furthermore, comparison of
subtilisin sequences from these 8 species indicated that

motifs containing the catalytic triad (Asp-His-Ser) were
conserved (Figure 7, right side).

encoding TbpA ([GenBank:HS_0449] and [GenBank:
HSM_0750]) and TbpB ([GenBank:HS_0448] and [GenBank:HSM_0749]). In strain 129Pt, GI I was identified
immediately upstream of the tbp locus. Furthermore,
homologs of H. somni strain 649 TbpA2 were present in
strain 129Pt ([GenBank:HS_0582], heme uptake protein)
and strain 2336 ([GenBank:HSM_0931], TonB-dependent receptor; [GenBank:HSM_0932], TonB-dependent
receptor plug; and [GenBank:HSM_1988], TonB-dependent lactoferrin and transferrin receptor). Pairwise
BLAST analysis identified several other putative genes
encoding proteins that may also be involved in iron
transport. In strain 129Pt these included [GenBank:
HS_0069], iron-regulated outer membrane protein;
[GenBank:HS_0181], TonB-dependent outer membrane
receptor; [GenBank:HS_0728], hemin receptor outer
membrane protein; and [GenBank:HS_1306], iron-regulated outer membrane protein. In strain 2336 they
included [GenBank:HSM_0047], TonB-dependent receptor; [GenBank:HSM_1168], TonB-dependent hemoglobin/transferrin/lactoferrin family receptor; [GenBank:
HSM_1176], outer membrane hemin receptor protein,
and [GenBank:HSM_1962], TonB-dependent receptor.
Two of the genes, [GenBank:HS_1306] and [GenBank:
HSM_1168], were strain-specific. Among others,
HS_0582 was associated with a transposase ([GenBank:
HS_0583]) and [GenBank:HSM_1168] was found near
PR IV.

Page 13 of 20

Within this gene repertoire, [GenBank:HSM_0938] (388
aa) and [GenBank:HS_0589] (386 aa) were 85% similar
to each other at the predicted protein level (75% identity, Score = 535 bits, E-value = 1e-156) and were associated with genes encoding putative ABC transporters
([GenBank:HSM_0939-0943] and [GenBank:HS_05900594], respectively, 99% identity, E-value = 0 to 5e-151).
In addition, [GenBank:HSM_0077] (4063 aa) and [GenBank:HS_0209] (5143 aa) were 65% similar to each
other at the predicted protein level (53% identity, Score
= 1009 bits, E-value = 0) and were also associated with
genes encoding putative ABC transporters ([GenBank:
HSM_0079-0081] and [GenBank:HS_0210-0212], respectively, 99% identity, E-value = 2e-146 to 3e-132).
Furthermore, although homologs of the H. influenzae
fimbrial gene cluster (hifABCDE) were absent in both
strains of H. somni, homologs of type IV pili genes
(pilABCD) occurred in strains 2336 and 129Pt (e.g.,
[GenBank:HSM_0123] and [GenBank:HS_0250], [GenBank:HSM_0217] and [GenBank:HS_1430, [GenBank:
HSM_0755 and [GenBank:HS_0457], and [GenBank:
HSM_0756] and [GenBank:HS_0458], 40-69% identity,
E-values = 1e-168 to 1e-38). In addition, both strains
contained a gene that encoded a putative pseudopilin
(pulG, [GenBank:HS_0264] and [GenBank:HSM_0137],
54% identity to NTHI1109, E-value = 9e-51) that may
facilitate type II secretion.

Overabundance of genes encoding adhesin-like proteins

Identification of genes encoding transcriptional
regulators and drug/metal resistance

Strain 129Pt contained sixteen genes randomly distributed throughout the chromosome ([GenBank:HS_0209],
[GenBank:HS_0383], [GenBank:HS_0478], [GenBank:
HS_0589], [GenBank:HS_0602], [GenBank:HS_0790],
[GenBank:HS_1058], [GenBank:HS_1085], [GenBank:
HS_1154], [GenBank:HS_1185], [GenBank:HS_1234],
[GenBank:HS_1512], [GenBank:HS_1543], [GenBank:
HS_1563], [GenBank:HS_1616], and [GenBank:
HS_1632]) with homology to genes that encode proteins
of the Yersinia adhesin (YadA) superfamily [13]. Strain
2336 also contained sixteen genes randomly distributed
throughout the chromosome ([GenBank:HSM_0077],
[GenBank:HSM_0338], [GenBank:HSM_0346], [GenBank:HSM_0377], [GenBank:HSM_0394], [GenBank:
HSM_0708], [GenBank:HSM_0844], [GenBank:HSM_09
38], [GenBank:HSM_0953], [GenBank:HSM_1022],
[GenBank:HSM_1212], [GenBank:HSM_1257], [GenBank:HSM_1484], [GenBank:HSM_1542], [GenBank:
HSM_1571], [GenBank:HSM_1793]) with homology to
genes that encode proteins of the YadA superfamily.
Adhesin-encoding genes [GenBank:HS_0209] (15,431
bp) and [GenBank:HSM_1257] (13,970 bp) were the largest among all protein coding genes predicted in the
chromosomes of strains 129Pt and 2336, respectively.

Pairwise BLAST comparisons indicated that strain 2336
contained 14 genes encoding transcriptional regulators
with no homologs in strain 129Pt. These included two regulators each that belong to the TetR ([GenBank:
HSM_1191] and [GenBank:HSM_1734]) and MerR ([GenBank:HSM_1728] and [GenBank:HSM_1741]) families,
one each that belonged to the LysR ([GenBank:
HSM_0806]), OmpR ([GenBank:HSM_0817]), and MarR
([GenBank:HSM_1737]) families, and a member of an
unassigned family ([GenBank:HSM_0489]; [GenBank:
COG2865K]). Among these, members of the TetR, MerR,
and MarR families were found within GI II. Strain 2336
also contained a gene adjacent to tetR encoding a tetracycline resistance antiporter (tetH; [GenBank:HSM_1735]).
The NCBI protein clusters database lists [GenBank:
HSM_1734] as a member of the PRK13756 cluster (TetR;
tetracycline repressor of Leuconostoc citreum[GenBank:
COG1309K]). The closest homologs of [GenBank:
HSM_1734] and [GenBank:HSM_1735] were found in
P. multocida (e.g., [GenBank:AAC43249] and [GenBank:
AAC43250] encoding a repressor protein and a tetracycline resistance protein, respectively, 99% identity, E-values
= 0 to 1e-116). In addition to [GenBank:HSM_1737],
strain 2336 also contained [GenBank:HSM_1736]

(encoding small multidrug resistance protein). [GenBank:
HSM_1191] is listed as one of the members of the [GenBank:CLSK391246] cluster (TetR family transcriptional
regulator). This regulator gene was associated with two
genes encoding an ABC-type transport system ([GenBank:
HSM_1192] and [GenBank:HSM_1193]). The closest
homologs of [GenBank:HSM_1191] were found among
members of Firmicutes, Spirochaetes, and Fusobacteria (e.
g., [GenBank:EFM38698] encoding a putative TetR family
transcriptional regulator in Eubacterium yurii subsp. margaretiae, 99% identity, E-value = 1e-104), but not the Pasteurellaceae. The two MerR homologs of strain 2336 had
only 39% identity to each other (E-value = 7e-23) and both
were conserved in members of the Pasteurellaceae (e.g.,
[GenBank:HAPS_1832] from H. parasuis and [GenBank:
PM1941] from P. multocida, 85-99%% identity, E-values =
4e-57 to 4e-70). However, the MerR homologs have been
included in different protein clusters ([GenBank:
HSM_1728] in [GenBank:CLSK892364] and [GenBank:
HSM_1741] in [GenBank:CLSK2299246]) and appear to
regulate different functions. Since [GenBank:HSM_1728]
was associated with genes involved in copper metabolism
([GenBank:HSM_1729] encodes a metal binding protein,
[GenBank:HSM_1730] encodes a multicopper oxidase,
and [GenBank:HSM_1731] encodes a copper-translocating
ATPase), it may encode a copper efflux regulator, CueR.
However, [GenBank:HSM_1741] may be involved in zinc
homeostasis since it was associated with zinc-responsive
genes ([GenBank:HSM_1740] encodes a zinc efflux protein and [GenBank:HSM_1739] encodes a zinc-dependent
hydrolase). The NCBI protein clusters database lists [GenBank:HSM_0806] as one of the members of the [GenBank:
CLSK797597] cluster (LysR family transcriptional regulator, [GenBank:COG0583K]). The closest homologs of
[GenBank:HSM_0806] were found in Pasteurella dagmatis
([GenBank:EEX49428], 65% identity, E-value = 5e-113),
H. influenzae ([GenBank:NTHI0936], 59% identity, Evalue = 1e-101), and several species of Streptococci (e.g.,
[GenBank:SUB1393] and [GenBank:SPy_1634], 50-52%
identity, E-values = 2e-86 to 1e-83). In strain 2336, [GenBank:HSM_0817] encoded a putative OmpR family
response regulator whereas [GenBank:HSM_1124]
encoded a putative ArcA family response regulator. These
response regulators have very low homology to each other
(33% identity, E-value = 7e-34). However, their amino-termini contained two conserved aspartic acid residues (Asp11 and Asp-56) that may serve as phosphate acceptors and
their carboxy-termini contained several conserved residues
that may be involved in DNA binding (data not shown).
Strains 2336 and 129Pt also contained genes that encoded
putative histidine kinases ([GenBank:HSM_0483] and
[GenBank:HS_1510], [GenBank:HSM_0727] and [GenBank:HS_0402], and [GenBank:HSM_1378 and [GenBank:

HS_0900]). Whereas [GenBank:HSM_1378] and [GenBank:HS_0900] had an ORF downstream that encodes a
putative cognate response regulator ([GenBank:
HSM_1379] and [GenBank:HS_0901]), [GenBank:
HSM_0727] and [GenBank:HS_0402] had an ORF downstream that encodes a transcriptional regulator with an Nterminal XRE-type helix-turn-helix domain ([GenBank:
HSM_0728] and [GenBank:HS_0403]). Strain 2336 contained an additional gene that encoded a putative histidine
kinase ([GenBank:HSM_0824]) that had a homolog in
P. multocida strain Pm70 ([GenBank:PM1380], 58% identity, E-value = 0), but not in strain 129Pt.
Identification of genes encoding restriction-modification
enzymes

Type I and Type II restriction-modification (RM) systems
comprise the most frequently encountered DNA modifying enzymes among eubacteria. Strain 2336 contained
ORFs that putatively encode proteins of the Type I RM
system ([GenBank:HSM_1615], hsdR, site-specific deoxyribonuclease; [GenBank:HSM_1617], hsdS, DNA specificity
subunit; [GenBank:HSM_1619], hsdM, DNA methylation
subunit). Although strain 129Pt lacked hsdM, it contained
a full-length hsdR ([GenBank:HS_0559]) and two truncated hsdS ([GenBank:HS_0554] and [GenBank:HS_0556])
orthologs. Strain 2336 also contained an operon putatively
encoding enzymes of the Type II RM system ([GenBank:
HSM_0801], M.hsoI, DNA-cytosine methyltransferase;
[GenBank:HSM_0802], R.hsoI, restriction endonuclease).
At the predicted protein level, M.HsoI has 68% identity to
M.HinP1I ([GenBank:AAW33810], E-value = 2e-121) and
R.HsoI has 72% identity to R.HinP1I ([GenBank:
AAW33811], E-value = 3e-105) of H. influenzae P1. Strain
129Pt lacked M.hsoI and R.hsoI but contained an operon
putatively encoding a BcgI-like RM system ([GenBank:
HS_0430], site-specific DNA-methyltransferase; [GenBank:HS_0431], restriction enzyme; [GenBank:HS_0432],
restriction enzyme; [GenBank:HS_0433], hypothetical protein) that is absent in strain 2336.
Identification of other genes relevant to metabolism and
survival

Both H. somni strains contained ORFs encoding proteins
putatively involved in the transport and metabolism of
fucose ([GenBank:HSM_0580] and [GenBank:HS_1451] to
[GenBank:HSM_0585] and [GenBank:HS_1446]), mannose ([GenBank:HSM_0956] and [GenBank:HS_0605] to
[GenBank:HSM_0960] and [GenBank:HS_0609]), xylose
([GenBank:HSM_0933] and[GenBank:HS_0584] to [GenBank:HSM_0937] and [GenBank:HS_0588]), galactitol
([GenBank:HSM_1030] and [GenBank:HS_1146] to [GenBank:HSM_1036] and [GenBank:/HS_1140]), mannitol
([GenBank:HSM_0825] and [GenBank:HS_1252] to

Siddaramappa et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:570
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/570

[GenBank:HSM_0827] and [GenBank:HS_1250]), and
myo-inositol ([GenBank:HSM_0425] and [GenBank:
HS_1586] to [GenBank:HSM_0435] and [GenBank:
HS_1576]). Furthermore, strain 2336 contained a locus
with three ORFs encoding proteins putatively involved in
galactose utilization (galTKM; [GenBank:HSM_0108] to
[GenBank:HSM_0110]), whereas strain 129Pt contained
only galM ([GenBank:HS_0236]) and truncated galK
([GenBank:HS_0235]) orthologs. However, both strains
have galE, and strain 129Pt has galactose in its LOS (38),
indicating that it can metabolize galactose.
Strain 2336-specific genes encoding proteins putatively
involved in carbohydrate metabolism included [GenBank:
HSM_0818] (ribokinase-like domain-containing protein),
[GenBank:HSM_0819] (ketose-bisphosphate aldolase),
[GenBank:HSM_0820] (sugar-related regulatory protein),
[GenBank:HSM_0821] (sugar binding protein), [GenBank:HSM_0822]
(monosaccharide-transporting
ATPase), and [GenBank:HSM_0823] (ABC type sugar
transporter). Strain 2336 also contained ORFs encoding a
cyclase family protein and a membrane-spanning protein
([GenBank:HSM_1907] and [GenBank:HSM_1908]).
These ORFs appeared to form an operon with ORFs
encoding proteins putatively involved in butyrate/pyruvate metabolism ([GenBank:HSM_1903] to [GenBank:
HSM_1906]). Furthermore, strain 2336 contained an
ORF that encoded an oligopeptide permease ABC transporter homolog ([GenBank:HSM_0695]). The putative
Opp protein of strain 2336 was related to OppB proteins
involved in peptide transport in E. coli and Bacillus subtilis (e.g., [GenBank:AAC74326] and [GenBank:OPPB_BACSU], respectively, 46-76%% identity, E-values = 2e138 to 1e-72).
GI I of strain 129Pt contained a gene encoding a putative phosphotransferase system protein ([GenBank:
HS_0437], cellobiose-specific IIC component) whose
homologs are found in M. haemolytica ([GenBank:
MHA_2539], 94% identity, E-value = 0) and H. parasuis
([GenBank:HAPS_1535], 86% identity, E-value = 0).
Strain 129Pt also contained a gene encoding a virulenceassociated protein E ([GenBank:HS_0427]). This protein
was related to the VirE proteins encoded by genes found
on Staphylococcus phage phi2958PVL ([GenBank:
BAG74398], 31% identity, E-value = 4e-36) and Enterococcus phage phiFL4A ([GenBank:ACZ64175], 33% identity, E-value = 3e-31). Strain 129Pt contained genes
([GenBank:HS_0631] and [GenBank:0632]) encoding a
putative serine/threonine protein kinase-phosphatase
pair. Strain 129Pt also contained loci encoding proteins
putatively involved in thiamine biosynthesis (thiMDE;
[GenBank:HS_0090-0092]), tellurite resistance (terDEZ;
[GenBank:HS_0633-0635]), and lysine degradation
(cadBA; [GenBank:HS_1006 and [GenBank:HS_1007]).

Discussion
Genetic events such as deletions, duplications, insertions,
and inversions are relatively common in bacterial chromosomes as a result of bacteriophage infection, integration
and excision of plasmids, transpositions, and/or replication-mediated translocations [40,41]. In addition, different
prophages embedded within a single chromosome can
contain similar genes encoding integration and structural
functions, and it is not uncommon for these genes to
undergo homologous recombination. One of the consequences of such homologous recombination is the rearrangement of the host chromosome [42]. These events are
known to be the precursors of evolution and can bring
about a significant change in the number, linear order,
and orientation of genes on the circular chromosomes of
different strains/species of closely related bacteria [43].
The presence of PRs in the chromosomes of strains
2336 and 129Pt was a notable feature since the number
and diversity of genes associated with these PRs far
exceeded those described in H. influenzae strains Rd
KW20 and 86-028NP [44,45]. The difference in the size
of the chromosomes of strains 2336 and 129Pt was partly
due to PRs and associated genes. Similar observations
have been made in other bacteria wherein prophageassociated sequences constitute a large portion of strainspecific DNA [42]. Although one of the functions of RM
systems is to afford protection against bacteriophage
attack (the “cellular defense hypothesis”), it is interesting
to note that both strains contain several prophage-like
sequences despite the presence of genes encoding putative RM systems in their chromosomes. The lack of
ORFs encoding HsdM, M.HsoI, and R.HsoI in strain
129Pt indicates that these systems are not absolutely
essential for cell survival. Their absence may also partially
explain the relative ease with which this strain can be

Biosynthesis of polysaccharides requires a multitude of
GTs, which catalyze the transfer of sugars from an activated donor to an acceptor molecule and are usually specific for the glycosidic linkages created [46]. Intra and
interspecies divergence of genes encoding GTs are not
uncommon. Phase-variable LOS is an important virulence factor of pathogenic strains of H. somni. Phase-variation of H. somni LOS has been shown to be due to the
presence of SSRs in genes that encode GTs and enzymes
involved in assembling non-glycose LOS components
such as phosphorylcholine [5,7,37]. The genes lob1,
lob2AB, and lob2D contain SSRs either just before the
start codons or within the open reading frame [47]. In
addition, [GenBank:HSM_0148], [GenBank:HSM_0164],
[GenBank:HSM_0975], and [GenBank:HSM_1552] also
contain SSRs that may be responsible for LOS phase variation, but require additional experimental investigation.

Most H. somni strains also produce a biofilm-associated
EPS consisting primarily of mannose and galactose [47].
Although characterization of some of the genes involved
in the biosynthesis and/or modification of H. somni LOS/
EPS has been determined, the identification of several
more has been facilitated by comparative genome analyses [12,13,37]. It is likely that some of the observed variations among genes encoding GTs in H. somni and
other Pasteurellaceae members is due to recombination
events and/or selective pressure. Furthermore, variation
in the composition and structure of the LOSs of strains
2336 and 129Pt may, in part, be due to different GT
genes they have acquired or lost. In view of this, the role
of new GT genes putatively involved in LOS biosynthesis
and phase variation that have been identified in this
study needs to be investigated.
Several types of two-partner secretion (TPS) pathways
have been identified and characterized in Gram-negative
bacteria [48]. Filamentous hemagglutinins (Fha), consisting
of a membrane-anchored protein (FhaC), which is
involved in the activation/secretion of the cognate hemagglutinin/adhesin (FhaB), are prototypes of two-partner
virulence systems. Homologs of FhaB and FhaC that possibly play a role in pathogenesis have been found in several
members of the genera Bordetella, Haemophilus, Proteus,
and Pasteurella, [49-53]. Among the 4 loci containing fha
homologs in strain 2336, locus II appeared to be an acquisition mediated by a transposon and locus I appeared to
be an acquisition due to homologous recombination. It
appears that strain 129Pt has lost an fhaB homolog due to
bacteriophage excision (Locus IV). It is possible that fhaB
homologs in locus I of strain 2336 are paralogs, as are the
fhaB homologs in locus IV. Together, these genes represent a large collection of fhaB and fhaC homologs in a single genome. The presence of multiple fhaB homologs in
strain 2336 may, in part, be responsible for the serum
resistance of this strain, in contrast to strain 129Pt, which
does not contain full length fhaB homologs and is serumsensitive [10]. Structural and functional studies of N-terminal fragments of FHA from B. pertussis and HpmA from
P. mirabilis have indicated that the proteins form a righthanded parallel b-helix [52-54]. Several residues that mediate the interaction of B. pertusis FHA with its cognate
FhaC, and facilitate secretion, have also been identified
[54]. Although H. somni FhaB homologs have some features in common with FHA of B. pertussis and HpmA of
P. mirabilis, a distinct region is the direct repeat 2 Fic
domain in the FhaB homolog in locus III of strain 2336
that has been shown to induce cytotoxicity in human
HeLa cells, bovine turbinate cells, and bovine alveolar type
2 cells [55,56]. However, the secretion determinants of
these proteins and the role of FhaC proteins in their secretion remain unknown.

Subtilases ([GenBank:COG1404]; subtilisin-like serine
proteases) are a large superfamily of functionally diverse
endo- and exo-peptidases that occur in prokaryotes and
eukaryotes [57]. Bacterial subtilisins may have a role in
pathogenesis besides facilitating protein degradation and
nutrient acquisition [58]. However, subtilisin-like serine
proteases from members of the Pasteurellaceae have not
been characterized previously. The presence of a gene
encoding a putative subtilase whose homologs were not
found in other members of the Pasteurellaceae was yet
another example of HGT in strain 2336. Although
H. ducreyi strain 35000HP contains genes ([GenBank:
HD1094] and [GenBank:HD1278]) encoding serine proteases that belong to the D-H-S family, they are unrelated
to each other and to [GenBank:HSM_188]. In Agrobacterium tumefaciens, genes encoding AAA-ATPase and subtilisin-like serine protease have been shown to be
functionally related and this pair has been proposed to
constitute a toxin-antitoxin system that contributes to stability of plasmid pTiC58 [59]. A conjugative megaplasmidencoded subtilase has been shown to be a virulence factor
in E. coli and it has been suggested this toxin activates a
V-ATPase in Vero cells [60,61]. Whether the ATPase-subtilisin pair identified in this study is transcriptionally and
functionally coupled, and whether the protease gene contributes to the pathogenicity of strain 2336, has yet to be
determined.
The ability to acquire and metabolize iron is an important determinant of bacterial survival and adaptability. In
some bacteria, genes that facilitate iron uptake have been
shown to be acquired by horizontal transfer [62]. Several
members of the Pasteurellaceae possess special outer
membrane protein (OMP) receptors consisting of two
unrelated transferrin-binding proteins, TbpA and TbpB,
which facilitate acquisition of transferrin-bound iron from
their hosts [63]. H. somni strain 649 has a TbpA-TbpB
receptor system that acquires iron only from bovine transferrin, and a second, probably redundant, TbpA2 receptor
that can acquire iron from bovine, caprine, or ovine transferrins [64]. From genomic analyses, it is apparent that
H. somni strains possess multiple genes for the acquisition
of iron. Horizontal transfer and clustering of genes related
to iron metabolism is indicative of enrichment and adaptation of pathogenic H. somni to different niches within its
natural host. Furthermore, products of one or more of
these genes may facilitate binding to transferrins/lactoferrins of different host species and such a gene repertoire
could enhance the ability of this bacterium to survive in a
variety of ruminants. Studies using a mouse model have
suggested the role of bovine transferrin and lactoferrin in
increasing the virulence of strain 2336 [65].
Many bacterial pathogens contain surface proteins
that facilitate adhesion to and/or invasion of the host

Siddaramappa et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:570
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/570

mucosal barriers [66,67]. Some of these proteins may
also be involved in bacterial aggregation to form biofilms and their evasion of the host’s innate immune system [67,68]. At least three major categories of bacterial
adherence proteins have been identified, two of which
are hair-like structures called pili and non-pilus-associated proteins called adhesins. The plasmid-encoded
YadA is a prototype non-pilus-associated protein that
has been well characterized [69]. Mutation or deletion
of the yadA homolog can reduce virulence in pathogenic bacteria [70,71]. Large adhesins in some bacteria
are associated with ABC transporters and may be
involved in biofilm formation [72]. A transposon mutagenesis approach has implicated several genes, including
those encoding filamentous haemagglutinins, in
H. somni biofilm formation [73]. H. somni also contains
genes putatively involved in adhesin synthesis/transport,
pilus formation, and quorum sensing (e.g., luxS), but
their role in facilitating biofilm formation remains to be
investigated.
Veterinarians use several antibiotics to treat H. somni
infections and feedlot cattle enterprises frequently rely on
tetracyclines for prophylaxis as well as growth promotion
[1,74,75]. Although not common, H. somni resistance to
tetracycline has been reported [76,77]. Copper and zinc
are often included in commercial cattle diets to achieve
optimal growth and reproduction. Emergence of copper/
zinc resistance in bacteria of animal origin has been documented and attributed to the excessive presence of these
metals in livestock feed [78]. Furthermore, the occurrence
of genes related to metal and antibiotic resistance on integrative/conjugative elements and their horizontal co-transfer has been noted previously [79,80]. In view of these
observations, it was not surprising to find a GI containing
genes putatively involved in copper, zinc, and tetracycline
resistance in strain 2336.
Transcriptional regulators play crucial roles in bacterial
functions and they have been classified into a number of
families [81]. The homologs of [GenBank:HSM_0806]
(LysR, [NCBI:CLSK797597] cluster) in H. influenzae and
P. dagmatis are associated with genes encoding proteins
involved in fatty acid metabolism (e.g., acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase, 3-oxoacid CoA- transferase, and fatty acid
transporters). Therefore, this cluster may represent a novel
class of metabolic regulators within the LysR family. Most
members of the [NCBI:PRK13756] cluster are involved in
regulation of antibiotic resistance genes [81]. Homologs of
[GenBank:HSM_1734] and [GenBank:HSM_1735] among
members of the Pasteurellaceae encode tetracycline resistance and are associated with mobile genetic elements
[82-86]. Homologs of [GenBank:HSM_1736] and [GenBank:HSM_1737] in other bacteria are known to be horizontally transferred and may mediate resistance to
antibiotics [87]. Furthermore, homologs of [GenBank:

Page 17 of 20

HSM_1192] and [GenBank:HSM_1193] are predicted to
be involved in multidrug resistance [88,89]. In summary, it
appears that strain 2336 contained at least three different
systems related to antibiotic resistance. Although the functional role of these genes remains to be established, their
similarity to metal/antibiotic resistance genes associated
with mobile genetic elements in other members of the
Pasteurellaceae is clinically significant.
From genome comparisons, it appears that there is no
correlation between chromosome size and the number of
tRNA genes (the genomes of H. somni 2336, H. somni
129Pt, H. influenzae 86-028NP, H. ducreyi 35000HP, and
P. multocida Pm70 contain 49, 49, 58, 46, and 57 tRNA
genes, respectively). Whether the lower number of tRNA
genes found in H. somni strains is due to disruptive integration of bacteriophages into tRNA genes (as in ‘bacteriophage disruption of tRNA genes in Lactobacillus
johnsonii’ [90]) or is a result of compensatory gene loss in
lieu of acquisition of new genes (as in ‘genome reduction
in pathogenic and symbiotic bacteria’ [91]) is unknown.
Nevertheless, comparison of the chromosomes of strains
129Pt and 2336 bolsters the proposition that prophages
and transposons have played a major role in creating
genomic diversity and phenotypic variability in the two
strains. It is also apparent that strains 2336 and 129Pt
have independently and intermittently acquired and lost
genes since their divergence from a common ancestor,
and that the net gain in strain 129Pt is less than the net
gain in strain 2336.

Conclusions
H. somni strain 2336 contains a larger chromosome when
compared to other Haemophilus and Histophilus strains
whose genome sequences are available. Several regions
that resemble the pathogenicity islands of other virulent
bacteria are present in strain 2336. There is evidence to
suggest that most of these regions were acquired by HGT
mechanisms, whereas similar regions were not found in
the commensal strain 129Pt. Although previous studies
have discovered the genetic basis for some of the phenotypic dissimilarities between strains 2336 and 129Pt, complete genome sequence analyses have provided a
comprehensive account of innate and acquired genetic
traits. Furthermore, comparisons of the genomes of strains
2336 and 129Pt have contributed to our understanding of
the biology and pathogenic evolution of these bacteria.
The post-genomic era for H. somni poses new challenges
and opportunities in terms of functional characterization
of genes and deciphering their roles in colonization, survival, and pathogenesis. Continued analyses of the genomes
of H. somni strains and comparison with newly sequenced
genomes of other bacteria should enhance the current
knowledge on virulence mechanisms. Nevertheless, the
results from this study are expected to facilitate the
