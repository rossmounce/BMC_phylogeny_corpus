Abstract
Background: The construction of robust and well resolved phylogenetic trees is important for
our understanding of many, if not all biological processes, including speciation and origin of higher
taxa, genome evolution, metabolic diversification, multicellularity, origin of life styles, pathogenicity
and so on. Many older phylogenies were not well supported due to insufficient phylogenetic signal
present in the single or few genes used in phylogenetic reconstructions. Importantly, single gene
phylogenies were not always found to be congruent. The phylogenetic signal may, therefore, be
increased by enlarging the number of genes included in phylogenetic studies. Unfortunately,
concatenation of many genes does not take into consideration the evolutionary history of each
individual gene. Here, we describe an approach to select informative phylogenetic proteins to be
used in the Tree of Life (TOL) and barcoding projects by comparing the cophenetic correlation
coefficients (CCC) among individual protein distance matrices of proteins, using the fungi as an
example. The method demonstrated that the quality and number of concatenated proteins is
important for a reliable estimation of TOL. Approximately 40–45 concatenated proteins seem
needed to resolve fungal TOL.
Results: In total 4852 orthologous proteins (KOGs) were assigned among 33 fungal genomes from
the Asco- and Basidiomycota and 70 of these represented single copy proteins. The individual
protein distance matrices based on 531 concatenated proteins that has been used for phylogeny
reconstruction before [14] were compared one with another in order to select those with the
highest CCC, which then was used as a reference. This reference distance matrix was compared
with those of the 70 single copy proteins selected and their CCC values were calculated. Sixty four
KOGs showed a CCC above 0.50 and these were further considered for their phylogenetic
potential. Proteins belonging to the cellular processes and signaling KOG category seem more
informative than those belonging to the other three categories: information storage and processing;
metabolism; and the poorly characterized category. After concatenation of 40 proteins the
topology of the phylogenetic tree remained stable, but after concatenation of 60 or more proteins
the bootstrap support values of some branches decreased, most likely due to the inclusion of
proteins with lowers CCC values. The selection of protein sequences to be used in various TOL

projects remains a critical and important process. The method described in this paper will
contribute to a more objective selection of phylogenetically informative protein sequences.
Conclusion: This study provides candidate protein sequences to be considered as phylogenetic
markers in different branches of fungal TOL. The selection procedure described here will be useful
to select informative protein sequences to resolve branches of TOL that contain few or no species
with completely sequenced genomes. The robust phylogenetic trees resulting from this method
may contribute to our understanding of organismal diversification processes. The method
proposed can be extended easily to other branches of TOL.

Background
Many biological processes can be better understood in the
framework of reliable phylogenetic analyses. This is not
only true for our understanding of evolutionary systematics and phylogenetics, including TOL, but it will also
largely contribute to our understanding of diversification
at the subcellular, cellular and organismal levels of integration. One well documented example in this respect is
the postulated whole-genome duplication (WGD) that
occurred during the evolution of some species belonging
to the Saccharomycotina [1]. Only using a correctly
inferred phylogenetic TOL it was possible to distinguish
between "pre-WGD" and "post-WGD" species of Saccharomycotina. Other examples refer to our understanding of
evolution of metabolic pathways [2], structure of
genomes [3,4], life styles [5], and pathogenicity [6].
Until recently, our understanding of the (fungal) TOL has
been based on two approaches, which basically differ in
number of species and genes considered: (1) few genes
and large number of species; (2) large number of genes
and few species. The clear advantage of the first approach
is the availability of many sequences, e.g. of the rDNA
locus, in publicly available databases (i.e. National Center
for Biotechnology Information – NCBI), and, secondly, it
is generally rather easy to generate complete or partial
sequences of a few genes for a large number of species.
Besides, the rDNA loci have the clear advantage of being
universally present in all branches of TOL, universal primers are well known and it has been successfully explored
in many branches of TOL. The disadvantage of the rDNA
loci, however, is that the deeper branches are usually less
supported [7]. As an answer to this, various authors
started to include multiple protein coding genes in their
phylogenetic analyses [8-10]. Unfortunately, the rationale
behind the selection of these protein coding genes is not
always clear, and discrepancies and incongruences
between individual gene trees may result in unresolved
phylogenetic trees [7,8]. This may be due to different evolutionary rates, and/or different origins of the genes, e.g.
whether nuclearly encoded (e.g. RPB1 and RPB2) or mitochondrial in origin (e.g. ATP6). In the second approach,
large numbers of genes have been used for phylogenetic
studies as an attempt to contribute to the first approach

described above. This was firstly applied in the prokaryotes [11] and, more recently, in eukaryotes as well [12-14].
A large selection of genes and/or proteins are concatenated and used for inferring phylogenetic relationships,
thereby increasing the phylogenetic signal considerably
[12,14-17]. However, although this approach resolved the
fungal phylogenetic tree [12,14,16,17] it also suffers from
some limitations. For instance, it does not take into consideration the evolutionary history of each individual
gene and it depends on the availability of complete
genome data.
Here, we explored the usefulness of comparing the cophenetic correlation coefficients (CCCs) among distance
matrices of individual gene trees in order to make a phylogenetically meaningful selection of orthologs to be considered for further phylogenomics studies as well as large
scale TOL and barcoding applications. We used the fungal
kingdom as an example as it represents one of the major
clades of life with approximately 1.5 million species [18],
of which only approximately 80.000 have been described.
Moreover, the fungi are morphologically, metabolically
and ecologically highly diverse and, importantly, the
number of completely sequenced genomes is high among
the eukaryotes.
Candidate proteins to be considered for TOL and/or barcoding studies were assessed from 33 fungal proteomes by
comparing (i) distance matrices of each individual orthologous protein (KOGs) matrix, (ii) to compare these with
that of a well supported guide tree [14], and (iii) analyze
for their phylogenetic signal. The method presented here
may be universally applied for the selection of markers in
various TOL and barcoding studies.

Results and Discussion
The 33 genomes investigated shared 4852 KOGs from
which 70 were single copy proteins. The function of these
70 KOGs was assessed from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae
genome database [19] (Additional file 1). The corresponding systematic name, standard name, description,
chromosome number and knock out phenotype are presented in Table 1 (Additional file 1). Knock out phenotypes of 32 genes were lethal (Table 1) when deleted in S.

cerevisiae [19], thus suggesting that they code for essential
proteins. Genes coding for the 70 KOG proteins are distributed on almost all chromosomes of S. cerevisiae, except
chromosome VI (Table 1), thus representing the entire
genome.
Comparing the CCC values of a 531 × 531 distance matrices analyzed before [14] using Pearson's correlation, indicated that KOG2671 represents the single copy protein
with the highest correlation value of 0.96 (Additional file
2). This KOG2671 protein (putative RNA methylase KOG
annotation) corresponds to ORF YOL124c of S. cerevisiae
[Catalytic subunit of an adoMet-dependent tRNA methyltransferase complex (Trm11p-Trm112p), required for the
methylation of the guanosine nucleotide at position 10
(m2G10) in tRNAs; contains a THUMP domain and a
methyltransferase domain]. The CCC values of the
remaining 69 single copy KOGs were compared with that
of KOG2671. Any of the subsequent five single protein
KOGs present in the list of 531 KOG proteins [14],
namely KOG2728 (Uncharacterized conserved protein
with similarity to phosphopantothenoylcysteine synthetase/decarboxylase), KOG0991 (Replication factor C,
subunit RFC2), KOG0340, (ATP-dependent RNA helicase), KOG0809 (SNARE protein TLG2/Syntaxin 16), and
KOG3786 (RNA polymerase II assessory factor Cdc73p),
could be used as a starting point for this comparison,
because the correlation values ranged between 0.95 and
0.96 (Additional file 2). The correlation values between
the distance matrix of KOG2671 and that of each of the
remaining 69 KOG proteins ranged from 0.08 to 0.93
(Table 1), and were statistically significant (Additional file
3). The majority of the KOGs (i.e. 64 from 70 KOGs) gave
correlation values higher than 0.50 (Table 1). As an example, we constructed a phylogenetic tree based on concatenation of these 64 KOGs (Fig. 1), which is in accordance
with previously published trees. Four KOGs gave CCC values below 0.36 (Table 1), thus indicating that they have
different phylogenetic signals. This is sustained by the
resulting phylogenetic tree showing a different topology
(Additional file 4) if compared with that based on 64
KOGs (Fig. 1). For instance, the Pezizomycotina formed a
sister clade to the Basidiomycetes and, S. pombe occured as
a basal lineage to both of them, but without statistical
support (Additional file 4).
Among the KOG proteins with CCC values above 0.50,
are many proteins involved in cellular processes and signaling. The other tree KOG categories [20], namely information storage and processing, metabolism, and poorly
characterized categories seem to be less informative (Fig.
2). When the KOG proteins are concatenated in increasing
numbers (e.g. the 10 with the highest CCC values; the 20
with the highest CCC values and so on) it can be seen that
the CCC values remains above 0.8 until 44 proteins have

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/134

been concatenated (Fig. 2). Thereafter, the CCC values
showed a sharp decline, indicating that the KOG proteins
44–64 have different phylogenetic signals. Interestingly,
the topology of the phylogenetic trees stabilizes after the
concatenation of 40 proteins (Additional file 5). After
concatenation of only 10 and 20 proteins the lineages
with C. glabrata, S. kluyveri, K. lactis and A. gossypii, and
that of C. lusitaniae, D. hansenii, C. guilliermondii and C.
albicans, and finally the Euascomycete lineage of C. globosum, N. crassa, M. grisea and F. graminearum showed
varying topologies (Additional file 5). Bootstrap values of
most branches were high irrespective the number of proteins concatenated (Fig. 1, Additional file 5). However, for
two branches, labeled 7 and 9 in Additional file 5, that
received lower bootstrap values, the maximum value
(85%) was obtained after concatenation of 40 KOG proteins. The A. gossypii-K. lactis-Sac. kluyveri lineage
(labeled as branches 4 and 5 in Additional file 5) received
only low support, and this was even true after concatenation of 531 orthologues [14]. This most likely indicates
that further improvement can only be obtained by further
species sampling in this lineage. Summarizing we estimate that 40–45 concatenated single copy protein KOGs
are needed to fully resolve fungal TOL. Below this number
the tree topology may be different, and above this number
the CCC values as well as the support values tend to drop.
Reevaluating fungal TOL
In all phylogenetic trees using 10–64 concatenated single
KOG proteins, the clades I, II and III correspond to the
Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and Zygomycota phyla,
respectively (Fig. 1, Additional file 5), thus agreeing with
analyses using a supertree method [16], a super alignment
using restricted orthology [21], and concatenation of six
genes [10], and 153 [15] and 531 proteins [14], respectively. Not surprisingly, the Ascomycota formed a sister
clade to the Basidiomycota, with the Zygomycota forming
a basal lineage.

The Ascomycota are well represented because of the
number of available sequenced genomes, and is subdivided into subphyla Pezizomycotina, Saccharomycotina
and Taphrinamycotina (Fig. 1). The Saccharomycotina
(clade IA) formed a sister group to the Pezizomycotina
(clade IB), with Taphrinamycotina (clade IC) forming a
basal lineage to both (Fig. 1). The resolution of the Saccharomycotina and Pezizomycotina is in agreement with
previous phylogenomic analyses [10,16,21].
The phylogenetic structure of the subphylum Saccharomycotina in our tree (Fig. 1) is similar to that based on a
combination of 153 protein families [15], but slightly differs from that based on an analysis using six combined
genes [10]. Noticeable differences are the positions of D.
hansenii, C. guilliermondii, C. lusitaniae and C. albicans. In

whereas in the four-gene analysis S. cerevisiae, S. paradoxus
and S. mikatae occupied different positions.
The subphylum Pezizomycotina is divided into four
clades: Sordariomycetes (clade IB1), Leotiomycetes (clade
IB2), Eurotiomycetes (clade IB3) and Dothideomycetes
(clade IB4) (Fig. 1). The phylogenetic positions of the Sordariomycetes, Leotiomycetes and Dothiomycetes have
been a matter of controversy. According to our analysis,
the Sordariomycetes and Leotiomycetes are sister clades,
which is in agreement with other studies [10,16,23],
although the tree in the latter study was only weakly supported. All these results are, however, in disagreement
with data resulting from a four-gene analysis [9], in which
the Dothideomycetes occurred as a sister clade to the Sordariomycetes. The position of Stagonospora nodorum
(Dothiomycetes) as a basal lineage in the Pezizomycetes
is highly supported in our analysis (> 90% bootstrap)
(Fig. 1, Additional file 5) and corroborates with data from
James et al. [10] and Robbertse et al. [17] who used maximum parsimony. However, in analyses based on a supertree method, and 153 concatenated proteins [15] and a

four-gene analysis [9], S. nodorum was found to be positioned next to the Eurotiomycetes [9,16,21] or closely to
the Sordariomycetes and Leotiomycetes [16].
All analyses using concatenated proteins with CCC values
above 0.50 (Fig. 1, Additional file 5) positioned S. pombe
(Taphrinomycotina) as a basal lineage within the phylum
Ascomycota, which is in concordance with many other
studies [10,14-16,21] using different sets of genes or
orthologous proteins and different methods of analysis
[15]. However, in another study [15], part of the concatenated orthologues resulted in a different position, which
was explained by assuming a different evolutionary origin
of these proteins.
The topology of the few basidiomycetous species
included, representing only two subphyla Agaricomycotina (clade IIA with Coprinopsis cinerea, Phanerochaete
chrysosporium, Cryptococcus neoformans var. neoformans, C.
neoformans var. grubii) and Ustilaginomycotina (clade IIB
with Ustilago maydis) (Fig. 1, Additional file 5) corroborates with previous studies [10,16].

Our method of protein selection using CCC values of
individual protein distance matrices seems an useful
approach as the resulting phylogenetic trees are largely in
agreement with those published elsewhere, and, importantly, most of the branches are well supported. The
resulting selection of proteins may also be used to analyze
the majority of fungal species for which a full genome is
not yet available in order to improve our understanding of
fungal TOL.
The performance of our method, if compared to the recent
AFTOL study [10], was assessed by comparing CCC values
between the protein distance matrix of reference KOG2671
and that based on the combined data set of six AFTOL
genes. The correlation value obtained was 0.73, thus indicating that our reference protein has a rather similar phylogenetic signal if compared to the AFTOL genes. However,
the inclusion of more genes increases the phylogenetic signal as demonstrated in our analysis (Fig. 1, Additional file
5), which may contribute to the resolution of discordant
branches, such as that of A. gossypii-K. lactis-S. kluyveri clade.

Conclusion
In short, the set of proteins resulting from our studies
presents a good selection to be elaborated in further studies on fungal TOL, which may include many nonsequenced species. As the proteins were selected across the
fungal kingdom and because they represent single KOG
proteins, they may also be suitable for the development of
molecular barcodes. This proposed method is universal
and can be extended easily to bacterial and archaeal TOLs
as well as other eukaryote lineages of TOL.

Methods
Assignment of genomes to KOG
In this study we used the complete genomes of 33 fungal
and one metazoa (Caenorhabditis elegans) (Table 2). The
group orthology framework presented in the KOG database [20] was the basis of our analyses. KOGs of
Caenorhabditis. elegans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288c and
Schizosaccharomyces pombe were obtained from the KOG
database [24]. Thirty one proteomes (Ashbya gossypii,
Aspergillus fumigatus, Asp. nidulans, Botritys cinerea, Candida
albicans, Can. glabrata, Can. guilliermondii, Can. lusitaniae,
Chaetomium globosum, Coccidioides immitis, Coprinopsis cinerea, Cryptococcus neoformans var. neoformans, Cryp. neoformans var.grubii, Debaryomyces hansenii, Fusarium
graminearum, Kluyveromyces lactis, Magnaporthe grisea, Neurospora crassa, Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Rhizopus oryzae,
Saccharomyces cerevisiae RM11-1a, Sac. bayanus, Sac. castellii, Sac. kluyveri, Sac. kudriavzevii, Sac. mikatae, Sac. paradoxus, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Stagonospora nodorum,
Ustilago maydis and Yarrowia lipolytica were assigned for
orthologies using the STRING program as described
before [25].

Comparison of KOGs represented by single protein
In order to avoid problems of paralogy we selected only
those 70 KOGs represented by a single protein shared by
33 complete fungal genomes. First, each protein from the
list of the KOGs that fulfilled this criterion was aligned by
Clustal X [26]. Second, poorly aligned positions and
divergent regions in each KOG alignment were removed
by using Gblocks 0.91b [27]. The threshold parameters
used were: minimum number of sequences for a conserved position = 50% of the number of sequences + 1,
minimum number of sequences for a flank position =
85% of the number of sequences, maximum number of
contiguous nonconserved positions = 8, minimum length
of a block = 10, not allowed gap positions, use similarity
matrices. Third, the distance matrix (percent divergence)
of each KOG protein was calculated between all pairs of
sequences from a multiple alignment of each KOG.
Finally, each KOG protein distance matrix was compared
to each other (70 × 70) by Pearson's correlation.
Selection of the reference KOG distance matrix
The distance matrices of the 531 KOGs used by Kuramae
et al. [14] were calculated. Then, the correlation matrix
values between distance matrices were determined by
Pearson's correlation as described. To find the KOG distance matrix to be used as reference we selected the single
copy KOG protein with the highest correlation value. This
reference distance matrix was then compared to the distance matrices of the remaining 69 KOGs selected.
Phylogenetic analysis
KOG distance matrices with correlation values higher
than 0.50 when compared to the reference KOG distance
matrix were concatenated, aligned, the poorly aligned
regions removed, and a phylogenetic analysis was done by
Maximum Likelihood (PHYML) [28]. The amino acid
model substitution used was JTT [29]. The number of substitution rate categories was 2. The model of rate heterogeneity was Gamma distribution rates with 4 categories. We
used Caenorhabditis elegans as outgroup for all phylogenetic trees reconstructions. Groups of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50,
60 and 64 KOGs protein according to decreasing cophenetic correlation values were selected, subsequently used
to build phylogenetic trees, and their support values
assessed using 100 replicates.
Comparison KOG reference and AFTOL combined genes
For this comparison we used 24 genomes present in
AFTOL for which entire genome data are available to calculate the distance matrix of the alignment from AFTOL
[30]. The six combined genes distance matrix from AFTOL
and the distance matrix of our reference KOG2671 were
compared by Pearson's correlation.

Phylogenetic trees based on concatenation of 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 and 64
KOG proteins with correlation values higher than 0.50. Branches with
different topologies obtained after concatenation of 10 or 20 proteins are
indicated separately. Support values indicated on the branches were
obtained by bootstrap analysis using 100 replicates. * indicates support
values of 98–100%. In the Table support values obtained after 10, 20,
30, 40, 50, 60 and 64 proteins (from left to right) are indicated for those
branches (labeled 1–12 in tree and table) that received support < 98% in
at least one of the sets analyzed are indicated. Note the low to moderate
support for lineages 4, 5, 7 and 9. Overall the bootstrap values tend to
increase until concatenation of 40 to 50 KOG proteins, but this is also lineage dependent (compare e.g. lineages 7, 9 and 12).
