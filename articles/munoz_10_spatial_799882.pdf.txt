Abstract
Background: The role of wildlife as a brucellosis reservoir for humans and domestic livestock remains to be
properly established. The aim of this work was to determine the aetiology, apparent prevalence, spatial distribution
and risk factors for brucellosis transmission in several Iberian wild ungulates.
Methods: A multi-species indirect immunosorbent assay (iELISA) using Brucella S-LPS antigen was developed. In
several regions having brucellosis in livestock, individual serum samples were taken between 1999 and 2009 from
2,579 wild bovids, 6,448 wild cervids and4,454 Eurasian wild boar (Sus scrofa), and tested to assess brucellosis
apparent prevalence. Strains isolated from wild boar were characterized to identify the presence of markers shared
with the strains isolated from domestic pigs.
Results: Mean apparent prevalence below 0.5% was identified in chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica), Iberian wild goat
(Capra pyrenaica), and red deer (Cervus elaphus). Roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), fallow deer (Dama dama), mouflon
(Ovis aries) and Barbary sheep (Ammotragus lervia) tested were seronegative. Only one red deer and one Iberian
wild goat resulted positive in culture, isolating B. abortus biovar 1 and B. melitensis biovar 1, respectively. Apparent
prevalence in wild boar ranged from 25% to 46% in the different regions studied, with the highest figures
detected in South-Central Spain. The probability of wild boar being positive in the iELISA was also affected by age,
age-by-sex interaction, sampling month, and the density of outdoor domestic pigs. A total of 104 bacterial isolates
were obtained from wild boar, being all identified as B. suis biovar 2. DNA polymorphisms were similar to those
found in domestic pigs.
Conclusions: In conclusion, brucellosis in wild boar is widespread in the Iberian Peninsula, thus representing an
important threat for domestic pigs. By contrast, wild ruminants were not identified as a significant brucellosis
reservoir for livestock.

Background
Brucellosis is an infectious disease caused by bacteria of
the genus Brucella, characterized by abortion and infertility in several mammal species, and being considered
one of the most important zoonosis worldwide [1]. Brucella melitensis, followed by Brucella abortus and Brucella suis, are the main species involved in the infection
of human beings, thus being the main target of eradication campaigns.

With very few exceptions, B. suis infection in both
humans and pigs remains an important problem in
most countries. B. suis biovar 2 is the main responsible
of brucellosis in pigs in Europe. Despite having been
isolated from human beings [2], this biovar 2 seems to
be less pathogenic for humans than the biovars 1 and 3
[3]. Other Brucella species have been isolated in
rodents, terrestrial carnivores, and sea mammals, but
the relevance of these Brucella species for livestock and
human beings is quite limited [3-5].
Wild animals are often at risk as a consequence of
contacts with infected livestock, particularly in extensive

breeding systems. In addition to the B. abortus infection
specific problem shared by cattle, bison (Bison bison)
and elk (Cervus elaphus) in limited territories of the
USA (see below), some sporadic cases have been
reported in wild bovids, such as ibex (Capra ibex) and
chamois (Rupicapra sp.) in the EU [6,7]. Although wild
ruminants have been suggested to hold brucellosis and
eventually originate spillback to domestic animals or
infection in humans, the most extended opinion is that
these wild animals are occasional victims of brucellosis
transmitted from infected livestock, rather than a true
reservoir of the disease for domestic animals [8]. In fact,
only limited cases of brucellosis have been reported in
these free-living animals [3,9,10], and only weak evidence for a direct relationship between brucellosis
apparent prevalence and wild ruminant population size/
density has been found (e.g. [11] and references therein).
However, the risk can be high in overabundant wildlife
populations in contact with infected livestock and when
artificial management increases aggregation [8,11]. In
the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem in the USA, winter
feeding of elk and bison contributes to maintain valuable wildlife populations and avoid contacts between B.
abortus infected wildlife and cattle, but significantly
increases the intra-specific transmission risk [12]. Modelling of observational data has shown that brucellosis
prevalence in elk correlates with the timing of the winter feeding season [13]. This underlines that human
dimension issues are fundamental to successful management of wildlife diseases [11].
Brucellosis caused by B. suis biovar 2 is frequently
reported in the Eurasian wild boar (Sus scrofa) and the
European brown hare (Lepus europaeus), and apparent
prevalence ranging from 8 to 32% has been reported in
wild boar in the EU [10,14-18]. It is accepted that both
species play a relevant role as a brucellosis reservoir for
domestic pigs, even under natural environmental conditions [3,15,19]. In fact, both wildlife species have been
directly involved in the transmission of infection to
domestic pigs reared in outdoor farms [10]. Outside the
EU, feral pigs may maintain B. suis biovars 1 and 3,
being a potential source of infection to both domestic
pigs and human beings [20].
Only limited information on wildlife brucellosis is
available in the Iberian Peninsula. Regarding wild ruminants, brucellosis has not been detected in limited studies conducted on Barbary sheep (Ammotragus lervia)
[21], Cantabrian chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica parva)
[22] and mouflon (Ovis aries) [23]. In contrast, several
cases of infections induced by B. suis biovar 2, have
been reported in wild boar [24] and European brown
hares [25]. Wild ungulates are currently expanding and
increasing in density in the whole Iberian Peninsula
[26], as well as the artificial management of these wild

Page 2 of 14

species including fencing, feeding and translocation,
then increasing the risk of infectious disease transmission [27].
The availability of accurate and validated diagnostic
tests is of paramount importance to properly assessing
the prevalence of brucellosis in wildlife [28]. In this
work we developed a multispecies iELISA to determine
brucellosis apparent prevalence in several Iberian wild
ungulate species, and determined spatial distribution
and risk factors associated with brucellosis. We hypothesised that: (1) free-living wild ruminants would not show
significant infection with Brucella species; (2) wild boar,
conversely, would show infection with B. suis biovar 2,
constituting a potential hazard for domestic pigs; and
(3) apparent prevalence would vary with environmental,
population and individual risk factors such as artificial
management.

Methods
Study area

The study area was the Iberian Peninsula in the southwestern European Union. This includes a variety of
habitats and climates, which can be simplified into 5 different Bio-regions in the mainland, as defined in the
Spanish Wildlife Disease Surveillance Scheme (Internal
report to the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, MARM
and spatial aggregation of wildlife. 2008). Table 1 summarises the most relevant characteristics of each Bioregion.
Animal sampling procedures

The number of samples obtained by species and study
region is summarised in Table 2. Sampling was opportunistic and biased towards the hunting season (October
to February in most species, and summer in chamois
and roe deer), and took place from 1999/2000 to 2008/
2009. The total number of wild ungulates sampled was
13,481, including 2,579 bovids (Barbary sheep, chamois,
Iberian wild goat and mouflon), 6,448 cervids (roe deer,
red deer and fallow deer) - see Table 2 for the precise
numbers in each animal species-, and 4,454 wild boar.
Samples were collected from hunter-harvested animals.
Blood was drawn from the heart or the thoracic cavity
during field necropsies, then the serum (usually haemolysed) was collected after centrifugation and kept frozen
at -20°C until analysed. Whenever possible, cranial and
iliac lymph nodes, spleen and sexual organs were collected and stored at -20°C for microbiological analyses.
The number of samples from the different animal species submitted to microbiological studies is shown in
Table 2.
Age-classes of biological meaning were defined. Based
on tooth eruption patterns, wild ruminants were classified
as fawns (first year of life), yearlings (second year of life),

juveniles (third to fourth year of life), and adults (fifth
year of life onwards). Wild boar less than 7 months old
were classified as piglets, between 7 and 12 months were
classified as juveniles, those between 12 and 24 months
as sub-adults, and those over 2 years as adults [29]. Sex
was known in 5,683 wild ruminants, and age-classes in
4,065. For wild boar, sex was known in 2,688 animals
and age in 2,419.

Serological studies

A multi-species indirect enzyme immunoassay (iELISA)
was developed and validated to assess brucellosis apparent prevalence. Briefly, a phenol-water smooth lipopolysaccharide (S-LPS) rich extract from B. melitensis 16M
was obtained as described elsewhere [30]. Standard 96well polystyrene plates (Maxisorp Nunc A/S, Roskilde,
Denmark) were coated with 100 μl of an antigen

Muñoz et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2010, 10:46

solution (2.5 μg/mL) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS;
10 mM, pH 7.2), and the plates incubated at 4°C overnight. After three consecutive washes with 0.05%
Tween-PBS, the plates were ready for use. Then, 100 μl
of the optimal dilution of each serum were added by
duplicate to each well, and the plates incubated for 45
min at 37°C. Optimal serum dilutions (assessed using 20
sera from culture positive and 20 sera from Brucella
free animals belonging the different domestic animal
species used as controls -see below-) in 0.05% TweenPBS were 1/100 (goats and phylogenetically related species) or 1/50 (the remaining animal species tested). The
non-reacting antibodies were removed by three consecutive washes with 0.05% Tween-PBS. Then, a conjugate
solution containing 0.2 μg/mL of recombinant protein
G/HRP (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, Ill, USA) in
0.05% Tween-PBS was added (100 μl/well), and the
plates incubated again for 45 min at 37°C. After three
consecutive washes with 0.05% Tween-PBS to remove
unbound conjugate, the reaction was developed with
100 μl/well of a 0.1% solution of 2,2-azinobis, 3-ethylbenzothiazoline sulfonic acid, diammonium salt (ABTS;
Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo., USA) and 0.004%
hydrogen peroxide in 0.05 M citrate buffer (pH 4). The
reaction was not stopped, and the OD at 405 nm was
automatically assessed (Multiskan RC; Thermo Labsystems, Vantaa, Finland) after 15 min of incubation at
room temperature in the dark. Results were expressed
as the percentage of optical density (%OD) using the
formula [% OD = 100 × mean OD of duplicated sample/mean OD of duplicate positive control]. Due to the
lack of gold standard sera (i.e., taken from culture positive and brucellosis free animals) from the different wild
ungulate species, the sera used for setting up and
iELISA validation were from Brucella culture positive
(CP) and Brucella-free (BF) phylogenetically related
domestic animals. Cattle sera were used as reference for
red, roe and fallow deer; goat sera for chamois and Iberian wild goat; sheep sera for mouflon and Barbary
sheep; and pig sera for wild boar. All gold standard sera
from domestic species were available at the serum collection of the CITA (Zaragoza, Spain). To establish the
optimal test conditions (i.e., those allowing the maximum of separation of %OD values between the infected
and free populations) for each animal species, sera from
88 CP and 88 BF cattle, 88 CP and 88 BF sheep, 44 CP
and 88 BF goats and 62 CP and 100 BF pigs were used.
The overall results were then submitted to ROC analyses (Medcalc. 9.2.1.0 software) and cut-offs resulting in
100% diagnostic specificity and the maximal diagnostic
sensitivity for sheep, goats and cattle (50%OD), and pigs
(40%OD), were selected to further assess the apparent
prevalence in the corresponding phylogenetically wild
animals tested.

Bacteriological analysis and Brucella typing

Necropsy samples (lymph nodes, spleen and/or sexual
organs) from iELISA-positive animals (see Table 2 for
precise numbers in each species) were submitted to bacteriological analysis. To assess the relative diagnostic
specificity of the iELISA developed, similar necropsy
samples taken from iELISA-negative animals (see Table
2) were also cultured. Briefly, each sample was surface
decontaminated by immersion in ethanol and gentle
burning, introduced in sterile bags, suspended in the
minimal amount of sterile PBS required for adequate
homogenisation, and then homogenised in a blender
(Stomacher; Seward Medical, London, UK). Each homogenate was smeared onto at least two plates of both Farrell’s and modified Thayer Martin’s culture media [31].
After 5-7 days of incubation at 37°C in 10% CO2 atmosphere, the resulting Brucella isolates were identified
according to standard procedures [32].
Brucella field isolates were further analysed using both
molecular and standard bacteriological procedures. Bacterial DNA was extracted using QIAamp DNA minikit
(QIAGEN, Hamburg, Germany). For the identification
and differentiation of Brucella species, the Bruce-ladder
multiplex PCR was applied as described elsewhere [33].
To assess the precise biovar and the different haplotypes
of B. suis biovar 2 strains isolated, a multiplex PCR [34]
and PCR-RFLP of omp31, omp2a and omp2b genes
[35,36] were used. The corresponding biovars of the two
B. melitensis and B. abortus strains isolated were identified by agglutination with monospecific A and M antisera, and growth patterns in culture media containing
Thionine and Basic Fuchsin (20 μg/ml) after incubation
with and without CO2 atmospheres [32].
Statistical analyses

We used Sterne’s exact method (up to N = 1,000), or
adjusted Wald method (N > 1,000) to estimate apparent
prevalence confidence intervals [37]. Apparent prevalence comparisons among categories were done with
homogeneity tests. The Mantel test was used to assess
the spatial association between brucellosis apparent prevalence in wild boar across different sampling sites. Calculations were done with the PASSAGE software [38].
Quantitative exploratory analysis of risk factors for
brucellosis apparent prevalence was carried out at two
different geographic scales (peninsular and regional)
using two-stage analyses. First, the associations between
all the hypothesized risk factors and apparent prevalence
were analyzed using single factor generalized models.
Factors that captured the effect of any set of highly correlated variables for which P < 0.1 were selected for
inclusion in the multivariate models (Table 3). In a second step, the selected variables were then jointly evaluated in a multiple logistic model. The individual iELISA

result (N = 3,883) was the response variable (binomial,
i.e. antibody presence or absence). Since sampling across
different populations was not homogeneous in relation
to age and sex, statistical analyses were conducted at the
individual level to control for them. Age was included as
a continuous discrete explanatory variable and sex was
included as a categorical binomial explanatory variable.
We used a stepwise strategy to obtain the final model.
Statistical significance was assumed wherever P < 0.05.
We used the SAS statistical package.
In the Peninsular scale model we controlled for the
effect of the Bio-region by including it as categorical
random variable. Factors tested are listed in Table 3.
In the smaller geographical scale model (Ciudad Real
province, Bio-region 3), we restricted our analysis to

wild boar sampled on 20 sites, that were well characterized regarding habitat characteristics (e.g. estate-related
environmental conditions, land cover and habitat structure) and relevant wildlife management factors such as
fencing, supplemental feeding, watering sites, and estimated abundance [39]. The variables tested are shown
in Table 3.
Hunting season (from 2000-2001 to 2008-2009) and

gold standard populations in domestic goats and its phylogenetically related Capra pyrenaica counterpart is shown
in Figure 1. As seen in this figure, a relatively wide range
of % OD were resulting in 100% sensitivity and specificity
with the gold standard populations tested, and this picture
was similar when using gold standard sera from the cattle,
sheep and pig populations used as reference controls. The
corresponding cut-offs for the different wild animal species tested were 50% OD (for all wild ruminant species)
and 40% OD (for wild boar), considering that the resulting
sensitivity and specificity with the corresponding gold
standard populations was always 100%.
The relative specificity of the iELISA versus the culture results obtained with the 50 iELISA negative wild
ruminants tested (Table 2) was adequate since no positive isolations were obtained in these animals. The relative specificity versus the culture results was also
adequate in wild boar, since only one B. suis biovar 2
strain was isolated from the cultured specimens of the
50 iELISA negative animals tested.
Studies in wild ruminant species

Our results revealed no or only very limited antibody
responses to infections by smooth Brucella species in Iberian wild ruminants (Table 2). Anti-Brucella antibodies
were detected in chamois, red deer, and to a lesser extent,
the Iberian wild goat. The highest apparent prevalence
(0.8%) was identified in chamois, being essentially detected

in the animals living in the Pyrenean Mountains, in Bioregion 2.
Altogether, the overall estimated apparent prevalence in
wild ruminants was as low as 0.4% (95% CI range 0.30.6%), and no significant inter-species differences (Chisquare = 10.2, 6 d.f., P > 0.05) or spatial aggregation (data
not shown) were evidenced. However, slightly higher
apparent prevalence was observed locally. As an example,
the percentage of red deer positive reactors reached maximum value of 1.9% (3 out of 158 animals tested; 95%CI
0.5-5.5) in the Garcipollera reserve (Pyrenees, Bio-region
2), and 0.8% (16 out of 1899 animals tested; range 0.5-1.4)
in the Montes Universales reserve (Bio-region 4).
Only two out of the 93 animals submitted to bacteriological analyses (one from a clinical case, 42 from iELISApositive animals, and 50 from ELISA-negative animals,
Table 2) resulted in Brucella positive culture. One of the
strains identified (B. melitensis biovar 1) was isolated from
the clinical case, a severely ill Iberian wild goat buck found
in Albacete province (Bio-region 4), and that resulted positive in the iELISA. The other strain isolated (B. abortus
biovar 1) came from a hunter-harvested red deer stag,
from Montes Universales reserve in Teruel province (Bioregion 4), and found also positive in the iELISA.
Studies in wild boar

In strong contrast with results found in wild ruminants,
wild boar showed a high apparent prevalence of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/10/46

brucellosis (33%; 95%CI 31.6-34.4; see also Additional
file 1), in all Bio-regions tested (Figure 2 panel A). The
highest apparent prevalence (average 46% with some
populations reaching over 80%) was found in Bio-region
3 (Figure 2 panel A). The remaining Bio-regions showed
lower but still high values (average 26%; Figure 2 panel
A). No statistically significant spatial association was
found by Mantel test (Pearson r = -0.10, N = 68; P =
0.99).
A total of 539 necropsy samples from iELISA positive
wild boar were submitted to bacteriological culture
(Table 2). One hundred and four isolates (representing
19.3% of the animals tested) were obtained from these
seropositive animals cultured, while only 1 of the 50
iELISA negative wild boar tested resulted in positive culture, being this difference statistically significant (P <
0.001). All isolates were identified as Brucella suis, and
the multiplex PCR identified patterns consistent with
those characteristic of B. suis biovar 2. The PCR-RFLP
of omp2a, omp2b and omp31 genes resulted in three different B. suis biovar 2 haplotypes (Figure 2 panel C).
Type A strains (N = 57) were found widely distributed
throughout Bio-regions 1, 2 and 3, whereas type C (N =
46) and B (N = 1) strains were restricted to Bio-regions
2 and 3, respectively (Figure 2 panel B).
Table 4 shows the variables included in the final largescale model. The probability of wild boar testing positive
in the iELISA was affected by age (Chi-square = 42.3, 3
d.f., P < 0.001; Figure 3 panel A), age-by-sex interaction,
rainfall, Bio-region and month. By contrast, apparent
prevalence was not affected by sex (males 35.8%, 95%CI
33.3-38.5; females 36.5%, 95%CI 34.0-39.0). Apparent
prevalence increased during the hunting season reaching
maximum levels in February (Figure 3 panel B). Apparent prevalence in wild boar also varied among Bioregions (Chi-square = 183, 4 d.f., P < 0.001), Bio-region
3 showing almost the double of apparent prevalence
than the other Bio-regions.
Table 5 shows the 6 variables included in the final
regional-scale model. The probability of testing positive
in the iELISA was affected by age-by-sex interaction,
sampling month, and the number of open-air bred pigs
per square Km in the sampling municipality. Fifty eight
additional variables resulted not statistically significant
in the first analysis and thus, not selected for the model
(Table 3).

Discussion
We developed and validated a multi-species immunosorbent assay and applied it to determine the apparent prevalence and distribution of brucellosis in wild ungulates
from the Iberian Peninsula. Our results showed that
wild ruminants do not play a relevant role in the maintenance of B. abortus and B. melitensis infections. In

Page 7 of 14

contrast, the wild boar was identified as an important
threat for B. suis infection.
The quality of the diagnostic methodology used is of
paramount importance to assess the prevalence of wildlife
diseases [28]. Due to the lack of brucellosis tests validated
for wildlife species, the most recommendable approach
for studies to determine brucellosis prevalence in wildlife
should be based in the use of classical serological tests
such as the Rose Bengal (RBT), which has been widely
validated in the domestic animal species phylogenetically
related with wild ungulates, and extensively used worldwide [40]. These classical tests, however, require samples
of a very high quality to avoid haemolysis problems.
However, gathering high quality serum samples devoid
from haemolysis is frequently impossible in standard
wildlife sampling procedures, particularly those based on
hunted specimens. To circumvent this problem, many
recent brucellosis studies in wildlife have been based on
immunosorbent assays -ELISA- [17,41,42]. One of the
advantages of this serological test is that the degree of
haemolysis of the serum samples does not affect significantly the ELISA performance [43]. Due to the absence
of specific conjugates against the immunoglobulin isotypes of the different wildlife species, indirect ELISAs
have not been widely used, and most of studies have
been based on the use of competitive ELISAs, which are
potentially able to identify specific anti-Brucella antibodies in all animal species [28,44-46]. However, due to the
absence of adequate gold standard sera, most studies in
wildlife have been performed using the protocols (i.e.,
serum dilution, antigen concentration, cut-off, etc) as
recommended by manufacturers in domestic livestock
[14,17,47], and therefore without adequate validation for
the corresponding wild species tested. Moreover, the problem of the false-positive serological reactions induced by
gram-negative bacteria sharing common epitopes with
Brucella [48,49], is also an important issue to properly
assess brucellosis prevalence. Hence, recent studies suggest the need for better diagnostic tools to obtain reliable
results in serological studies on brucellosis in wildlife
[17].
The best gold standard known in brucellosis diagnosis
is the isolation of the bacteria. However, individual bacteriology is cumbersome, unpractical and very expensive
to be used as the unique test to determine the prevalence of brucellosis in animal populations. Thus, the
most recommendable approach is a combination of serological and bacteriological studies, such as those conducted here. We developed an iELISA using an antigen
sharing the major common surface epitopes present in
all smooth Brucella species [50,51], allowing the diagnosis of infections induced by B. abortus, B. melitensis and
B. suis. The lack of availability of polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies raised to detect specifically the

immunoglobulin isotypes of wildlife species was overcome by using protein G as a conjugate. This reagent
has been reported suitable in wildlife for detecting antibodies to Brucella [52,53] and other pathogens [54,55].
Due to the absence of gold standard sera from culture
positive and brucellosis free wild animals, we validated
our iELISA using gold standard sera from the closest

phylogenetically related domestic species. The adequate
relative sensitivity of the iELISA with respect to the bacteriological status of the animals was confirmed in wild
boar, in which the number of strains isolated from seropositive animals was relatively high (Table 2), being
comparable to those obtained in similar studies conducted in the EU [52].

The success for bacteriological isolation depends on
the quality of the samples cultured. Unfortunately, in
our study it was not always possible to obtain necropsy
samples of proper quality, which probably decreased the
final sensitivity of the bacteriological methods applied.
This can explain the relatively high number of samples
from iELISA positive animals that resulted in negative
culture. Moreover, the relative specificity of the iELISA
versus culture results was also adequate since only one
out of the 50 iELISA negative animals tested yielded a
positive culture. However, this iELISA negative serum
from an infected wild boar could also be due to a recent
B. suis infection in which antibodies of the IgG isotypes
(the only ones detected by protein G) had not yet been
produced, or simply, as a consequence of a human error
in sampling or identification.
The relative sensitivity of the iELISA developed could
not be properly assessed in wild ruminants due to the
low apparent prevalence figures detected and, accordingly, the low number of iELISA positive samples cultured (Table 2). The only two animals in which field
Brucella strains were isolated resulted positive in the
iELISA. Finally, no brucellae were isolated from the 50
iELISA negative wild ruminants tested, this result supporting the adequate relative specificity of the serological test developed. Therefore, this iELISA should be
considered as adequate enough for detecting Brucella
antibodies in the wild species studied.
At least for the species with large sampling sizes
(Table 2), it can be concluded that wild ruminants are
not a significant potential source of B. abortus and B.
melitensis infections for livestock in the Iberian Peninsula. However, data on species with a limited sample
size, such as Barbary sheep (N = 8) and mouflon (N =
75), are not enough to support that general conclusion.
The finding of the B. melitensis infected Iberian wild
goat in a locality with no active sampling stresses, however, the importance of setting up passive wildlife surveillance networks.
The small variations in the geographical distribution
of seropositive wild ruminants can reflect sampling
biases rather than real differences in apparent prevalence. However, the relatively high apparent prevalence
found in some areas could be also related with the high
prevalence of brucellosis in domestic species reared in
extensive breeding systems. As an example, the percentage of red deer and chamois positive reactors reached
maximum values in some areas of the Pyrenees (Bioregion 2), and red deer in the Montes Universales
reserve (Bio-region 4), that were coincident with some
brucellosis outbreaks taking place in domestic sheep and
cattle in these mountain areas during the 2002 and 2004
seasons (Gobierno de Aragón, Annual Animal Health
Report, unpublished data).

Current knowledge on B. abortus epidemiology in the
Yellowstone area strongly suggests that artificial management including crowding and supplemental feeding
influences the dynamics of wildlife brucellosis [13]. The
very low apparent prevalence of brucellosis in Iberian
wild ruminants may be explained by a couple of nonmutually excluding hypotheses. First, the relatively low
overall prevalence of brucellosis in domestic ruminants
in Spain makes the transmission to wildlife highly
improbable, despite the existence of important risk factors such as overabundance [27]. Second, artificial feeding in southern Spain takes place mostly in summer,
once the lambing/calving season is over. Thus, abortions
occurring at winter feeding sites as in elk in the Yellowstone area [13], are unlikely. This is consistent with
recent results on the effects of management on elk
behaviour and brucellosis transmission [56].
In strong contrast with the situation in wild ruminants, the wild boar population was found seriously
affected by B. suis biovar 2 infection. The general apparent prevalence figures found herein (Table 2) were similar to those indicated in other European reports
[10,14-17,57]. However, apparent prevalence close to
100% was recorded locally (Figure 2). Bio-region 3, the
area where game is more intensively managed through
fencing, feeding and translocation, was the region with
the highest apparent prevalence (Figure 2 panel A). This
Bio-region concentrates practically the whole Iberian
censuses of domestic Iberian pigs reared in fully out
door breeding systems.
The absence of sex effects on brucellosis apparent prevalence in wild boar (Table 3) was not surprising, since similar results have been found also in other diseases [39,58].
However, we found at both geographical scales a significant effect of the sex-by-age interaction on the apparent
prevalence of brucellosis (Table 3). This effect can be
explained by sex and age related differences in wild boar
behaviour [59]. While females live in matriarchal groups,
adult males live solitary and only contact with these
matriarchal groups during the mating season [60]. Apparent prevalence observed among adult wild boar was higher
than that found in younger age classes, as expected by the
higher participation in reproduction by adults [61].
In wild boar, positivity to several other infectious
agents has been linked with density, spatial aggregation
or artificial management (e.g. Aujeszky’s disease [61,62];
Bovine tuberculosis [39]; Porcine circovirus type 2 [58]).
However, no relationship between apparent prevalence
and wild boar management or density risk factors has
been evidenced in this study. There is no clear explanation for this finding, and further research is needed to
better identify the factors modulating B. suis infection.
Several authors have suggested that spillover from
wild boar and European hares to domestic pigs could be

Muñoz et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2010, 10:46
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/10/46

a frequent event, and the explanation of the re-emergence of brucellosis due to B. suis biovar 2 in outdoor
reared pigs in EU countries [63,64]. Historical contact
between free ranging Iberian domestic pigs and wild
boar could have boosted wild boar infection with B. suis
biovar 2 in the Iberian Peninsula. As indicated above,
Bio-region 3 is the Spanish region with more open-air
bred domestic pigs [26], and in which the apparent prevalence figures in wild boar were maximal (Figure 2). In
the small scale study carried out in this Bio-region 3, a
positive relationship between apparent prevalence in
wild boar and the density of open air bred Iberian pigs
was evidenced (Table 5). This may contribute to explain
the important prevalence of brucellosis reported in Iberian pig farms in the last years in Spain [24,65]. Accordingly, having in consideration the close genetic
characteristics of the strains isolated in Spain [25], our
study confirms that domestic Iberian pigs reared outdoor and wild boar share the same brucellosis infection
due to B. suis biovar 2. Three out of the five wild boar
estates showing the highest apparent prevalence were
fully open and sharing pastures with free-ranging
domestic pigs.
In an attempt to further characterise the B. suis biovar
2 infection in wild boar, a DNA-based study was applied
to all strains isolated (Figure 2 panel C). None of the
three B. suis haplotypes identified (A, B and C; Figure 2
panel C) were coincident with the molecular patterns
characteristic of the B. suis biovar 2 Thomsem reference
strain (Figure 2 panel C). However, these three haplotypes were consistent with those previously identified in
domestic pigs and wild boar in Spain, Portugal and
other European countries [24,66]. The B. suis strains
previously isolated from pigs and wild boar in the Iberian Peninsula corresponded exclusively to both A and B
haplotypes, and with a neat predominance of type A (32
strains) versus type B (10 strains) [24]. In agreement
with this, the type A strains isolated (57 strains) were
largely predominant on type B (only one strain isolated)
in our study (Figure 2, panel C), and were widely distributed in Bio-regions 1, 2 and 3 (Figure 2, panel B).
The haplotype C had never been reported previously in
the Iberian Peninsula, but it has been reported in
domestic pigs from France and Croatia and also in wild
boar from France, Italy and Switzerland [24]. Surprisingly, this haplotype C was found in similar proportions
as haplotype A (Figure 2, panel C). However, and interestingly, this haplotype was restricted exclusively to Bioregion 2 (Figure 2, panel B). This can explain the
absence of previous reporting of this particular haplotype in Spain since none of the papers published were
dealing with strains isolated from this Bio-region.
Altogether, it can be concluded that B. suis biovar 2
strains isolated from Iberian wild boar are spatially

Page 11 of 14

structured. This structuring was conserved despite frequent translocations taking place for hunting purposes
[67].
In contrast with the situation reported in France [68],
wild boar were capable to maintain B. suis biovar 2
infection independently of the existence of European
brown hares. Interestingly, the unique B. suis biovar 2
strain isolated from European brown hare in Spain [25]
was showing a molecular pattern different from the
three haplotypes identified in this study in wild boar
(J.M Blasco, unpublished results). This hare strain was
showing also different restriction patterns from those
identified in the B. suis biovar 2 Thomsen reference
strain and other B. suis biovar 2 strains isolated from
hares in France, which show common patterns with
those identified in wild boar (B. Garin-Bastuji, personal
communication). This suggests that at least in Spain, the
B. suis biovar 2 haplotypes infecting European brown
hares and wild boar may be different. However, this
must be confirmed in further studies using larger numbers of animals. The possible role of the Iberian hare
(Lepus granatensis) in B. suis biovar 2 epidemiology is
currently unknown. No isolation of B. suis biovar 2 has
been reported in Iberian hares but no adequate studies
are available. Suitability of Iberian hare habitat, meaning
open, flat, sparsely-forested Mediterranean agrosystems,
was selected in the first step of the analysis, but not in
the final model. Its weak link with wild boar apparent
prevalence may be due to a correlation between Iberian
hare habitat suitability and Bio-region 3. A similar
explanation can be given for the inclusion of rainfall in
the large-scale model, having in consideration that rainfall is more abundant in the North (e.g. Bio-region 1)
than in Bio-region 3 (Table 1).
Data provided herein suggest that B. suis biovar 2
infection can be maintained in wild boar in an independent epidemiological cycle to that taking place in
domestic pigs. The period of the year (month of sampling) was a significant factor affecting apparent prevalence (Tables 4, 5), suggesting that the reproductive
season may influence brucellosis spreading among wild
boar. An alternative explanation could be related with
differences in host-specific behaviour, for example
regarding carrion consumption from gut piles during
the hunting season (October to February).

Conclusions
In summary, we conclude that free-living wild ruminants are not a significant brucellosis reservoir in the
Iberian Peninsula but conversely, wild boar is an important threat regarding B. suis biovar 2 infection. This
represents an important hazard particularly for the Iberian pig population reared in out door breeding systems,
but the entry of the disease in the highly intensified pig

Muñoz et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2010, 10:46

industry should not be disregarded. This situation could
become of great concern if brucellosis control programs
in domestic pigs are envisaged.
