Abstract
Background: Previously, a database characterizing examples of Embryophyte gene family lineages
showing evidence of positive selection was reported. Of the gene family trees, 138 Embryophyte
branches showed Ka/Ks>>1 and are candidates for functional adaptation. The database and these
examples have now been studied in further detail to better understand the molecular basis for plant
genome evolution.
Results: Neutral modeling showed an excess of positive and/or negative selection in the database
over a neutral expectation centered on the mean Ka/Ks ratio. Out of 673 families with assigned
structures, 490 have at least one branch with Ka/Ks >>1 in a region of the protein, enabling a
picture of selective pressures delineated by protein structure. Most gene families allowed
reconstruction back to the last common ancestor of flowering plants (Magnoliophytes) without
saturation of 4- fold degenerate codon position. Positive selection occurred in a wide variety of
gene families with different functions, including in the self incompatibility locus, in defense against
pathogens, in embryogenesis, in cold acclimation, and in electrontransport. Structurally, selective
pressures were similar between alpha-helices and beta- sheets, but were less negative and more
variant on the surface and away from the hydrophobic core.
Conclusion: Positive selection was detected statistically significantly in a small and nonrandom
minority of gene families in a systematic analysis of embryophyte gene families. More sensitive
methods increased the level of positive selection that was detected and presented a structural basis
for the role of positive selection in plant genomes.

Background
The search for lineage- specific genes and phenotypically
important lineage- specific evolution has intensified with
the increasing number of genome sequences, driven
through population genetic (intra- specific) analysis of
SNPs and through inter- specific molecular evolutionary
analysis [1]. Gene duplication has classically been viewed

as a source of evolutionary innovation [2]. Differing views
have emerged as to the role of gene duplication in driving
evolutionary novelty, including concerted evolution in
tandemly repetitive families, mediating genetic robustness, subfunctionalization, and neofunctionalization de
novo or involving pre-adaptation [3-7]. In both paralogs
(emerging from lineage- specific gene duplication events)

and in orthologs, phenotypically important changescan
emerge along a specific lineage via changes in gene expression, in alternative splicing, in coding sequence evolution,
or through a host of other mechanisms (see [8] for a discussion). This study will focus mostly on coding sequence
evolutionary dynamics.
Amino acid substitutions in a protein sequence can be
advantageous, neutral or deleterious to the organism.
There are several links in this process. An individual substitution can effect individual protein folding or function.
The individual protein then interacts with other molecules in the execution of cellular and organismal functions. These functions are selectable as they differentially
effect the organism's ability to survive, mate, and reproduce in competition with other individuals in the species,
as modulated by the effective population size of the species. On top of this, environments can change, changing
the structure and optima in the fitness landscapes with
time (giving temporal variation to the flatness/ruggedness
of the fitness landscape).
Even without environmental change, the nature of this fitness landscape is open for debate. Driven by the clocklike evolution of many gene families, the view that a large
number of substitutions are neutral or nearly neutral on a
flat fitness landscape emerged ([9], see [10] for a review).
An alternative view to account for this is presented
through a selectionist interpretation of a rapidly changing
fitness landscape driven by strong selective pressures on
protein stability and dynamics [11,12]. Evidence for this
view comes from the metastability of proteins. However,
it has been shown that the metastability of proteins can
emerge as a neutral product of the selection process [13].
This has led to yet another hybrid view, where protein
sequences take neutral walks through sequence space,
punctuated by rarer adaptive changes. The positive selective effects can be dictated by simple compensatory covariational changes, but can also be explained by true
environmental adaptation.
In examining the evolution of individual sites, the molecular clock frequently breaks down. A gamma distribution
has been used to model the distribution of rates across
sites to characterize the differences in site-specific selective
pressure [14]. More recently, it has been proposed that a
single gamma distribution may not be adequate and sites
shift co-evolutionarily through evolution in a process
called heterotachy [15]. The complexity of this process has
even led some to believe that biology has no underlying
rules or mechanisms and no models are possible (see for
example [16]). Ignoring this last view, we seek to obtain
an overview of the substitutional process and characterize
the positive selection that has been detected in embryophytes to shed light on the evolutionary process.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/12

Several methods have been developed to detect positive
selection in protein-encoding genes (for a review, see
[17]). One way to evaluate the selective pressures on protein evolution is to compare the rate of synonymous and
non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions. Ks is the estimated number of synonymous changes per synonymous
site and corresponds to the rate of amino acid- neutral
evolution. Ka, on the other hand, is the number of nonsynonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site.
Under neutral protein- level evolution Ka should be equal
to Ks and hence the ratio Ka/Ks = 1. Deviations from this
mark selective pressures at the protein level. It should be
noted that Ks itself can be under selective pressures that do
not act on Ka, like selection for optimal expression level
based upon codon use and tRNA concentration [18].
However, this effect is not expected to generate a large
false positive rate in the use of Ka/Ks to detect positive
selection.
A Ka/Ks ratio < 1 indicates negative (purifying) selection.
The criterion for positive (adaptive) selection is Ka/Ks>1.
This is a quite stringent criterion of positive selection,
when averaged over an entire gene and is likely to miss
certain cases where positive selection is operating (even
with more powerful approaches [19]). The method used
to calculate the Ka/Ks ratio is averaged over time and so
negative selection over the majority of time covering a
long branch can mask a short period of positive diversifying selection. Similarly, the method averages over all sites,
including those in the hydrophobic core that are frequently under very negative selective pressure to retain a
folded scaffold. To avoid that problem, in a straight -forward approach, one can use a sliding window to detect
selection (one- dimensional window analysis [20-22]).
This approach is designed to detect selective sweeps,
where additional mutations hitchhike to fixation together
with a positively selected residue. On the other hand, this
method will miss strong selective pressures acting on individual regions of a protein driven structurally or functionally. Therefore one can take advantage of a known threedimensional structure of the protein of interest and group
sites according to their proximity in the structure, estimating Ka/Ks in different regions [23,24]. This 3D windowing
method works by sliding a sphere of defined radius
through a three dimensional structure and calculating Ka
and Ks within each sphere for each branch of a three
dimensional structure. If the sequence divergence within
a family is small, it can generally be assumed that the
structure will have changed little over the course of evolution within the family and homology model generation is
not necessary. In that case, a solved 3D structure is only
needed for one member of a close gene family.
The analysis of the evolution of plant gene families has
been limited to a few selected cases where adaptive evolu-

tion has been suspected: the self- incompatibility locus
proteins in Solanaceae [20], S- phase kinase-associated
protein 1 (SKP1) [25], trypsin inhibitors [26,27], the
anthocyanin pathway [28,29], and chitinase genes [30].
Other studies focused on specialized genera and discovered adaptive evolution in, for example, cytochrome c oxidase of bladderworts [31]. The release of the fullgenome
sequences of Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress; Arabidopsis)
[32] and Oryza sativa (rice) [33,34] brought a whole new
dimension into the field, including the study of gene and
genome dynamics [35,36]. Comparing a selection of Arabidopsis lyrata (lyrate rocketcress) ESTs with the whole
genome sequences from Arabidopsis, Barrier and coworkers [37] discovered that 14 out of 304 orthologous
genes revealed signs of adaptive evolution.
Analyzing the data in The Adaptive Evolution Database
(TAED) [38], we studied 87 protein families with at least
one branch showing a Ka/Ks>>1. Further analysis provided both a characterization of selective pressures and
substitution rates, including as dictated by structure using
the 3D windowing approach described above.

Results
From 138,662 Embryophyte genes from GenBank release
136, 4,216 gene families were built in TAED. The ratios of
non- synonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitution rates (Ka/Ks) cover a range from 0.00 to 7.21 per
branch with an average value of 0.21 ± 0.04 (Figure 1).
Modeling shows that the database contains more negative
and/or positive selection than the neutral expectation

selection). After manual curation of the automated
results, 87 families showed Ka/Ks>>1. Of these, 53 families were pairs of putative proteins or proteins of
unknown function. Most of these pairs originated from
the genome annotations of Arabidopsis and rice.
Although most of these pairs originated from the above
genome annotations, they were all confirmed by an EST in
at least one species (and conservation across species without introduction of spurious stop codons) and therefore
were presumed to be real rather than annotation artifacts.
41 of the 53 pairs were even confirmed by EST detection
in at least two species. Future embryophyte gene and
genome sequencing in these families will create a fuller
picture of these evolutionary events.
8 sequence pairs and 26 families with 3 or more
sequences of 'known' function showed Ka/Ks rate ratios
significantly greater than 1 (Table 1). The highest values
were recorded for a ferredoxin in the sequence pair Zea
mays (maize) and rice (7.21 ± 0.47) and a pair of mannose
binding lectins in rice and Hordeum vulgare (barley; 5.93 ±
0.28).
We also calculated Ka/Ks rate ratios for families where a
structure existed in PDB at a maximal distance of 70 PAM
units. The values in the 10Å windows calculated cover a
range from 0.00 to 27.46 with an average value of 0.35 ±
0.20 (Figure 2). Out of 673 families, 490 had at least one
branch with Ka/Ks>>1.
The gene families with high Ka/Ks values covered a wide
range of cellular functions, including at the self incompatibility locus and at shoot elongation (Figure 3). In the global analysis more than 65% of the families under positive
selection were of unknown function. 11% had a catalytic
activity and 6% were involved in some kind of binding
(DNA or protein). When the large number of proteins of
unknown function were excluded from GO annotation
categorization, enzyme inhibitors, and genes with nutrient reservoir activity, cell wall organization and biosynthesis, and cellular response to water deprivation
functions were over- represented in the high Ka/Ks dataset. When 3D windowing was used (Figure 4), then proteins with catalytic activity, and those involved in protein
biosynthesis, development, intracellular transport, RNA/
DNA metabolism, and organelle organization and biosynthesis joined the list of over- represented GO terms.
Some examples of defense – related proteins were
detected, although surprisingly, defense- related proteins
in general were not significantly over- represented in the
high Ka/Ks dataset.
Within the self incompatibility locus, several RNases seem
to have been under positive selection. In Solanaceae, this
family has 25 branches with values significantly above 1.

Table 1: A list of Embryophyte gene families with high Ka/Ks values detected using whole gene averaging is shown. The p- value and
expected rate of false positive detection given multiple tests per detected branch hypothesis (Bon*) are shown as a measure of
statistical significance. Statistical significance is measured against simulated proteins evolved according to measured parameters
rather than against evolved pseudogenes evolving neutrally at the amino acid level (as is sometimes used as a null model in
evolutionary studies). The null distribution is therefore centered at 0.21 rather than 1.0.

In Rosaceae four high values occurred on branches leading to Pyrus pyrifolia (sha li) (1.18 ± 0.02), to Crataegus
monogyna (hawthorn) (1.20 ± 0.02 and 1.10 ± 0.01), and
to a clade containing Malus x domestica (apple), Crataegus
monogyna and Sorbus aucuparia (rowan) (1.04 ± 0.01). A
family of cysteine rich S- locus proteins [39] from Brassica
species had 11 significant branches. An S- locus F- box
protein in Prunus mume (Japanese apricot) showed allelic
diversity [40] and we found a Ka/Ks value of 1.31 ± 0.01
on the branch to protein b.

Other families under positive selective pressure are found
in plant defense mechanisms. In the chitinase III family of
Poaceae a branch of 1.08 ± 0.01 leading to rice was
observed. The neighboring branch led to a clade containing other rice sequences and Triticum turgidum (poulard
wheat). The Triticum gene is annotated as xylanase inhibitor. The chitinase A and B genes were found in family
9484 and showed similarly elevated values on branches to
maize as previously reported [30].

and between the class V thionins and the purothionins in
Triticeae (wheat, oat, barley; 1.30 ± 0.03). A flower- specific gamma thionin in Solanaceae showed a value of 1.29

jasmonic acid, i.e. upon wounding of the plant by herbivory. Genes from Solanum tuberosum (potato) and Solanum

Several Late Embryogenesis Abundant proteins with high
Ka/Ks rate ratios were also observed. LEA proteins are
involved in desiccation tolerance in the drying seed. The
highest value was found for proteins from Glycine max
(soybean) and Arabidopsis in a subfamily of the D113
proteins (1.91 ± 0.08). Another family included proteins
probably involved in cold- response from bread wheat
and Cicer arietinum (chick- pea) at a value of 1.78 ± 0.07.
The third candidate for adaptation on LEA proteins was
the PACCAD clade of grasses containing e.g. maize [42].

nigrum (black nightshade) showed a value of 1.03 ± 0.01
on the branch to potato.
Proteinase IV is a cysteine proteinase with a preference for
glycyl bonds from the latex of papya [45] and had a value
of 1.05 ± 0.01 in Caricaceae on the branch to Carica candamarcensis (mountain papaya).
Other families showing signs of adaptive evolution were
found in plant development and intracellular transport.
Cytochrome P450 proteins are involved in steroid synthesis and oxygenation reactions. In rice, a cytochrome P450like protein was separated by a branch with a value of 1.06
± 0.01 from a clade with Arabidopsis, rice, and Musa acuminata (banana). Dof zinc finger transcription factors are
plant specific proteins and showed a Ka/Ks value of 1.14
± 0.06 in the Magnoliophyta pair Arabidopsis and barley.
The phytochrome family is involved in light perception
and plant development [46]. Within Coniferales, a branch
leading to Cephalotaxus fortunei (Fortune's plum yew) with
a Ka/Ks value of 1.12 ± 0.01 was observed.
Two families of lipid transfer proteins in monocotyledons
also showed signs of positive selection. The first family is
root specific and had a Ka/Ks ratio of 1.26 ± 0.03 on a
branch towards rice. The second family had two branches
under positive selection. The first branch within Triticeae
had a value of 1.04 ± 0.02 and led to bread wheat and
poulard wheat. The second branch is in Poales and led to
Poaceae (rice, barley) with a value of 1.43 ± 0.03.
TIM23 is a family of mitochondrial inner membrane proteins involved in the translocation of proteins in to the
mitochondrial matrix. There are generally three isoforms
in each species. The branch leading to rice isoform 3
showed a Ka/Ks value of 1.12 ± 0.06.

Ferredoxin is a soluble low molecular weight protein that
mediates transfer of one electron from a donor to an
acceptor. It is involved in a broad spectrum of redox
metabolism in plastids and mitochondria. The extreme
value of 7.21 ± 0.47 separated the sequence pair of maize
and rice.
Beta expansins and xyloglucane endotransglycosylases are
proteins involved in shoot elongation. Both genes seem to
have been under positive diversifying selection in the
monocot Schedonorus pratensis (meadow ryegrass). The
beta expansins have a high Ka/Ks value of 1.21 ± 0.01 in
comparison to bread wheat. And the xyloglucane
endotransglycosylase Xet2 has a value of 1.02 ± 0.01 compared to barley.
In the 3D- windowing approach, 49% of the families with
nucleotide substitution rate ratios above 1 had catalytic
activity and only 10% were of unknown function. Binding
activities occurred in 17 % of the families (Figure 4). The
largest number of additional functions observed to have
undergone positive selection compared to the global
sequence analysis, were hydrolases and MADS- box transcription factors. These proteins have defined specific
selectable binding pockets.
In Table 2 we show ratios of identical four- fold degenerate codons for the 10 most populated nodes in the embryophyte tree of life in a pairwise analysis. This shows that
even without considering phylogeny, the average family
can be analyzed back through the last common ancestor
of flowering plants (Magnoliophytes).
In examination of general structural constraints on
sequence evolution as seen in Table 3, the hydrophobic
core has the strongest negative selection, while residues of
intermediate solvent accessibility and those on the surface
showed less negative selective pressures with larger vari-

ances of selective pressure. No significant differences were
seen between secondary structural elements (data not

Discussion
The database underlying the systematic study performed
here contains 4216 gene families. In a global sequence
analysis, 87 of these families showed at least one branch
with a Ka/Ks ratio above 1. Most of the gene families identified to be under positive selective pressure were just
sequence pairs. The majority of these pairs came from the
genome annotations of the only two fully sequenced
genomes of Arabidopsis and rice. This is also the reason
why a lot of these pairs were of unknown function. Furthermore, the two genomes were from quite distant species: Arabidopsis is a dicotyledonous plant, while rice a
monocotyledonous plant, and they shared a last common
ancestor about 135 – 250 Mya [47]. This point in Table 2
did not, on average, show saturation in a pairwise comparison of sequences.
In the future, more embryophyte genomes will be fully
sequenced and this will be reflected in the database that
was used for this study. This will eliminate the need to
include potentially lower quality EST sequences in the
analysis to enrich phylogenetic coverage. The number of
species with ESTs is currently much higher than the
number of species with full cDNA sequences. In addition,
the EST database covers a broader spectrum of cellular
functions than the fully sequenced known genes. However, it is anticipated that the general picture of embryophyte coding sequence evolution will remain robust as
underlying datasets become fuller.
Most of the gene families we found have molecular functions that are known to be under positive selective pressure. The self- incompatibility locus (S- locus) in
flowering plants is a highly polymorphic region that
inhibits self- fertilization. The genes in this region are
under a high diversifying selective pressure, as Clark and
Kao already showed for Solanaceae [20]. Mating and sexual selection are classic examples of an evolutionary arms
race.

Defense genes were also expected to show up in our analysis, as they are involved in the cellular arms race (another
classic example) against pathogens, and different species
show resistance to different pathogens. Individual defense
gene examples were detected, but this was not general in
a statistically significant way. The functions involved
among those detected include chitinases, proteinases,
proteinase inhibitors, and lectins. The chitinase III family
in our database showed a high Ka/Ks branch to a rice gene,
other genes in this clade are annotated as xylanase inhibitors. Further analysis on the sequences and especially
their biochemical function will have to show if this clade
is working as a chitinase or/and as a xylanase inhibitor in
vivo and what causes this functional change.
Among the defense related genes we can also find the
lectins, which are a quite heterogeneous family of carbohydrate binding proteins involved in defense against herbivory and probably cellular signaling [48]. Other lectins
are used as storage in leguminous seeds, where they can
act as major food allergens in humans.
The results from the 3D- windowing show a quite different pattern of cellular functions under selective pressure
than the global analysis (Figures 3 and 4). Some of this is
due to functional sampling bias in PDB. However, the
increased detection of positive selection using this
approach may be linked to regions having undergone true
functional change. It has been proposed that many proteins can change function under positive selection using
only a small number of residues [49]. Alternatively, it
might be taken as evidence for structural co- evolution in
a heterotachy model (some structural co-evolution occurs
allosterically- see [50] for example). Interestingly, applying a method that searches for evidence of multiple
gamma distributions to characterize a gene family does
not show a significant correlation between shifting gammas and Ka/Ks>>1 [[51], Pierre Pontarotti, personal communication]. This lack of a significant correlation remains
unexplained, as a correlation would be expected if both
methods are detecting the same signal of positive diversifying selection leading to functional shifts.
The distribution of non- synonymous to synonymous
nucleotide substitution rate ratios in the database from

BMC Plant Biology 2006, 6:12

0.00 to 7.21, with an average of 0.21 ± 0.04 shows a strong
negative selection on most branches in our gene families.
The simulated sequences created with the same average
Ka/Ks ratio has a much narrower distribution, with many
fewer examples of Ka/Ks>1 (Figure 1). This indicates an
excess of negative and positive selection acting on the
embryophyte tree of life. Comparing the data from the
3D- windowing to the global sequence analysis, we see a
similar distribution of values in both cases, with some
additional positive selection occurring in the 10 Å windows, shifting the average value to 0.35 ± 0.20. These windows tended to correspond with regions of proteins that
were more solvent accessible, consistent with the results
seen in Table 3. It should be emphasized that the same
codon positions can occur in multiple windows and that
more windows contain surface positions than windows
containing only hydrophobic core residues. In addition to
the greater resolution to detect positive (and negative)
selection with a greater variance of Ka/Ks ratios, the asymmetrical distribution of windows can explain the increase
in the average Ka/Ks value (see [24] for a discussion of the
statistical properties of this method).
In general, the 3D windowing approach offers greater
power to detect regions where positive selection may have
occurred, as proteins evolve new functions in specified
regions of proteins (for example binding pockets) while
retaining the same fold and hydrophobic core. 3D windowing is especially attuned to detecting the signal from
the region undergoing neofunctionalization without averaging the signal together with that from the highly conserved core and folding- critical residues.
The analysis of the 10 most populated nodes for the fraction of identical four- fold degenerate codons in a pair
wise comparison of sequences, shows, that saturation is
not reached on average nodes as far back as the last common ancestor of flowering plants 135 to 250 million years
ago [47]. This allows us to compare the sequences without
ancestral sequence reconstruction on most Magnoliophyte families, including the split between Arabidopsis
and rice. Further, using reconstructed ancestral sequences
has been shown to increase the evolutionary time that can
be accessed without saturation, dependent upon the tree
topology and articulation, as reflected in individual
branch lengths [52]. There is, of course, a large degree of
variation between families and this must be evaluated on
a family by family basis.
This study has characterized a snap shot of the evolutionary process acting upon higher plant gene families. We
find a large degree of non-random variation in the selective process across gene families, including an excess of
positive selection in some functions characterized by an
evolutionary arms race. Examining evolution in the con-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/12

text of three dimensional structure adds power to the analysis in detecting additional positive selection and
displaying the complexity of the selection process. Future
work will extend this analysis to enhance our view of both
the general evolutionary process and of the functions that
are shifting through protein coding gene sequence as
closely related species diverge.

Conclusion
Positive selection was detected in specific gene families
along specific lineages providing a set of candidate genes
for functional adaptation that warrant further experimental study. Further, this set of genes represented a small but
nonrandom and statistically significant part of plant
genome evolution. This global picture, in combination
with studies at the population genetic level are providing
a general picture of the role of selective forces in plants in
shaping biodiversity through lineage- specific processes.

Methods
The TAED database was built as described in Roth et al.
[38]. 138,662 embryophyte sequences longer than 10
amino acids from 4,568 species were extracted from GenBank release 136 [53]. After an all-against- all BLAST
search [54] global PAM distances were calculated for each
hit using Darwin [55]. Families were built by single linkage clustering from sequences annotated as complete,
with pairwise PAM distances of 100 PAM units above a
relative length threshold. For each family, a multiple
sequence alignment was calculated using POA [56]. Phylogenetic trees were estimated by Bayesian inference using
MrBayes [57]. A novel soft parsimony approach [58] was
used to simultaneously root the trees and map them onto
the NCBI taxonomy. Distant families were split based on
alignment quality as measured in the percentage of gaps
and where the oldest node in the tree was identified as a
duplication event rather than a speciation event. This
served to increase alignment quality, a possible source of
false positive positive selection. For each branch of every
phylogenetic tree, Ka/Ks ratios were calculated using a previously established ancestral sequence reconstruction and
counting- based approach (see [59-61]) with a Ks lower
cut- off of 0.05. Branches were preliminarily considered
significant if Ka- V(Ka)>Ks+V(Ks) and at least two nonsynonymous substitutions occurred along the branch.
This statistical assessment was refined through evaluation
with a neutral null hypothesis, as described below. The
procedure described above automatically generated the
TAED database and hits were manually curated for this
study. Manual evaluation of positively selected genes
involved examination of the alignments, where in families with branches with Ka/Ks>1 and alignments where
some sequences had a high percentage of gaps, the effect
of these sequences on the alignment and subsequent calculation of Ka/Ks ratios was evaluated.

PDB- structures were assigned to families at a distance of
70 PAM units. For each family with a structure, a new multiple sequence alignment was calculated included the
structure. From this, sequences were threaded through the
structure and contact maps with a radius of 10Å were calculated. Then Ka/Ks ratios were determined within these
10Å- windows for each sphere along each branch of every
phylogenetic tree [24]. Significant branches were selected
as previously described [24].
To compare the results with a null (actually a combination of neutral and negative selection in the absence of
positive selection) model, we used Evolver from the PAML
package [62]. Families were generated with non-Ka/Ks
parameters sampled proportionately from the distribution obtained by codeml (PAML) analysis of all TAED
families and with the amino acid distribution derived
from TAED as a whole. Trees and branch lengths were randomly selected from the distribution in the database, and
Ka/Ks was set to the mean value of the database (0.21).
Ka/Ks values were then calculated for these simulated
families as described above. The simulated dataset was
used to calculate both p- values and an expected false positive rate, given multiple tests (equivalent to the Bonferroni correction multiplied by the number of tests) to
assess statistical significance. Many of these whole gene
calculations will likely be unambiguous true positives
when more sensitive methods that look at sequence subsets (like [24]) are employed. Employing a null model
that is based upon positive selection free parameters estimated from comparative genomic data rather than a null
model based upon pseudogenes (which these are not) is
expected to give a more realistic (less overly conservative)
picture of statistical significance, even though this has not
traditionally been employed in evolutionary studies.
Saturation of synonymous sites was calculated as the fraction of identical four- fold degenerate codons in a
sequence pair if at least five shared codons occur. These
pairwise values were projected onto the node of the species tree that joined them from the mapping of the gene
family tree to the species tree. From these pairwise values,
average gene saturation at every node in a gene family tree
was calculated. Then these nodes were projected onto the
corresponding node in the embryophyte tree of life. This
is different from the along- branch calculation used in
TAED to discard saturated datapoints, but is given as an
estimate of how far back (on average), pairwise analysis
enables estimation of Ks.
367 families in TAED with close structural homologs in
PDB were used to categorize general structural properties
of sequence evolution. Using DSSP, both the secondary
structural elements and solvent accessibility of each residue site were identified [63]. After partitioning residues

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/12

into secondary structural categories and solvent accessibility categories, Ka/Ks calculation was performed in the 367
families over each branch for each partition and averaged
values compared.
To determine which GO terms [64] were over- represented
among the gene lineages having undergone positive selection, the functional annotations of the gene family dataset
as a whole and the global and tertiary windowing high Ka/
Ks datasets were compared to GO, and gene families
assigned to a small number of selected GO terms. Overrepresentation was determined by examining the ratio of
GO term frequency per positively selected branch to GO
term frequency in the total set of test branches in the
TAED database.
