Abstract
Background: TreeBASE, the only data repository for phylogenetic studies, is not being used
effectively since it does not meet the taxonomic data retrieval requirements of the systematics
community. We show, through an examination of the queries performed on TreeBASE, that data
retrieval using taxon names is unsatisfactory.
Results: We report on a new wrapper supporting taxon queries on TreeBASE by utilising a
Taxonomy and Classification Database (TCl-Db) we created. TCl-Db holds merged and
consolidated taxonomic names from multiple data sources and can be used to translate
hierarchical, vernacular and synonym queries into specific query terms in TreeBASE. The query
expansion supported by TCl-Db shows very significant information retrieval quality improvement.
The wrapper can be accessed at the URL http://spira.zoology.gla.ac.uk/app/tbasewrapper.php
The methodology we developed is scalable and can be applied to new data, as those become
available in the future.
Conclusion: Significantly improved data retrieval quality is shown for all queries, and additional
flexibility is achieved via user-driven taxonomy selection.

Background
Systematics aims to increase our understanding of biological diversity by identifying and classifying organisms and
using phylogenies to understand the relationships
between organisms. The field has developed very elaborate and sophisticated tools for phylogeny construction,
and practitioners have been very active in building new,
better and faster algorithms [1,2]. However, this has not
been matched with database development for long term
access and storage of the phylogenies produced by these
algorithms. Although much of the data used in phylogenetic analysis is acquired from databases in other fields,

particularly specimen data from museum collections [3]
and sequence data [2] such as those available at NCBI [4],
the results of phylogenetic analysis are not as easily accessible. Mostly, phylogenetic data are retrieved through literature searches and remain buried in the pages and
supplementary material sections of the journals in which
they are published. This inaccessibility of data compounds the practicality of its use and limits the full potential of information reuse. Projects such as the Tree of Life
[5]http://www.tolweb.org/tree face significant data accessibility issues.

The Tree of Life aims to build a complete phylogenetic tree
of the world's biodiversity, and to ultimately describe the
history of life on earth. The informatics requirements are
considerable, as the available data collections grow in size
and complexity. Confronting the information explosion
requires creative new approaches to facilitating the use of
that information. Finding information in complex data
sets becomes increasingly difficult as the data grow, therefore data search and discovery needs to be timely, intuitive
and precise. Data retrieval through meaningful queries [6]
is paramount to the successful fulfilment of the ever more
sophisticated data requirements of the systematics community. A phylogenetic data repository [7] should have a
good understanding of the organisms that are represented
in the phylogenetic trees and support searches using species and higher taxa names. However, currently this is not
the case. TreeBASE [8] is currently the only repository for
phylogenetic analyses. Here we show that data retrieval
using taxonomic names as query terms is inadequate.
In the GenBank http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank
sequence data base, which contains the NCBI taxonomy,
a query can be performed to retrieve all insect sequences
or all Drosophila sequences. TreeBASE, however, does not
contain a taxonomy and queries selecting all Drosophila
studies or phylogenetic trees for insects are not easily specified. The inclusion of a taxonomic infrastructure within
TreeBASE is essential to support such queries.
To address the problem of TreeBASE querying, we
designed a taxonomic data warehouse combining taxonomic names and classification data that can be superimposed on TreeBASE to enable hierarchical and linguistic
query expansion. Our hypothesis was that data integration in a warehouse would also provide breadth of coverage for taxon names by combining data from multiple
sources.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. The next section provides background on taxonomy and its uses in
systematics. An outline of the user requirements and a
description of TCl-Db, the data warehouse built as a taxonomic infrastructure for TreeBASE, and the methods of
query expansion are then given. Finally, we show retrieval
problems experienced by TreeBASE users through an analysis of the query logs from TreeBASE. We conclude that
data retrieval difficulties are in part due to the lack of taxonomic intelligence in TreeBASE, and we demonstrate
improved data retrieval based on the use of TCl-Db and
the software infrastructure we created, as compared to
results delivered by Phylofinder [9].
Taxonomy
Taxonomic data are produced by the processes of Naming,
which involves attaching a label to a concept for the pur-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/93

poses of communication, and Classification, that is arranging similar concepts together for the purpose of
organisation. The name provides a handle on the biological organism and the position in the classification provides knowledge of the organism in terms of its similarity
to others [10]. This section gives a brief overview of the
difficulties users experience when utilising taxonomic
data.
The taxonomic classification system is an information
storage and retrieval system [11], originally designed to be
easily memorised [12]. Taxon names serve two roles; the
name represents an organism that was described and
named by a taxonomist and the name is also placed in a
hierarchy to relate the organism to the tree of life. This
duality presents difficulties in the use of taxonomic
names. The interdependence between the name and the
classification, the fact that names are not necessarily
unique to one organism and also that the placement of an
organism's name into the hierarchy is not fixed, all complicate the use of taxonomic names for information storage and retrieval. Compounding this is the distributed
nature of the data. The taxonomy field uses over 200
information systems http://data.gbif.org/datasets/. This
number will continue to grow as herbariums and museums digitise their collections [13] and make their data
accessible on the web. Although taxonomy has firmly
taken its place as a digital science, data accessibility continues to cause difficulty; with the distribution there is
also the heterogeneity of the data and the lack of one all
encompassing taxonomic reference. Given that the
amount of data is growing and the data is in constant flux,
it is unlikely that it will be possible to agree on a 'unitary
taxonomy' [14]. However, a single all encompassing data
portal is achievable [15], and this challenge is being
addressed by GBIF [16] and projects such as the Encyclopaedia of Life [17].
Most taxonomic data systems were developed to meet particular requirements in their use or data scope. Taxonomic
data is, by its nature, distributed. The data produced from
taxonomic research tends to follow a particular focus, a
group such as insects or birds, or a geographical location,
or a period in history. There is significant heterogeneity in
the data models and storage formats of the databases and
the interfaces provided to access the data. The taxonomic
community have established the Taxonomic Databases
Working Group (TDWG) to address data standards, data
integration and interoperability. This effort is beginning
to alleviate some of the accessibility and interoperability
problems experienced by users [18]. Taxonomic data are
also not easily deployed outside the systems in which they
are stored. This is due to the nature of taxonomic names.
As stated in [19], taxa are not facts like the data in most
other databases, instead, taxa are hypotheses which are

"proposed, used, modified, and then perhaps discarded,
as evidence dictates". The classification of an organism is
based on a set of criteria selected by the expert taxonomist.
Not only do these criteria change, for example, sequence
versus morphology, [20], but also different criteria are
used by different taxonomists (different morphological
characteristics can be given different weights).
Additional complications arise from the addition of new
data as new organisms are discovered, and taxonomic
revisions that are made to update existing groups. There
can be, at any one time, more than one accepted taxonomic opinion on the name and classification of an
organism. This complicates the use of taxon names as
search terms, as the meaning of the names can change. For
example, in situations where a name has changed for taxonomic reasons, such as Diomedea albatrus which was
changed to Phoebastria albatrus [21], additional support is
needed to recognise that relevant data may be attached to
both of these terms. When the user performs a search on
Phoebastria albatrus, should any data associated with
Diomedea albatrus also be returned? Similarly, when a user
performs a search on a vernacular term 'short-tailed albatross', is it assumed that the system should translate this
term to the appropriate Latin names, i.e. Phoebastria
albatrus and Diomedea albatrus? Also, when a search is performed on the term Aves, we need to know whether the
user requires the NCBI meaning of the term or the ITIS
[22] meaning of the term. It is not surprising that at the
time of development the TreeBASE developers shelved
these taxonomic issues. It is now timely and important to
address the taxonomic requirements of TreeBASE, given
that the system is in the process of being overhauled by
the CIPRES project [23].
CIPRES, CyberInfrastructure for Phylogenetic RESearch
have taken over responsibility for TreeBASE and as part of
their database research programme, they plan to overhaul
the database to enable more complex queries than those
currently available in TreeBASE. The new version of TreeBASE is named TreeBASE2 and the published Entity-Relationship model contains a taxon module from which it
appears that the taxonomic data will be curated from
external data sources. However, the documentation does
not suggest that hierarchical queries will be directly supported by the TreeBASE2 schema. In addition to
TreeBASE2, the CIPRES project have two other research
programmes: algorithms for phylogenetic reconstruction
and visualisations; and a modelling programme that aims
to build mathematical models that can be used to test
phylogenetic reconstructions. The project aims to build a
complete infrastructure of data and algorithms for the systematics community.

Systematics
Like taxonomists, most systematists focus their research
on a particular group. For these scientists the taxonomic
requirements are fairly manageable, and usually involve
the most up-to-date checklists. Most scientists are adept at
keeping up-to-date with the literature in their area and for
the most part they produce their own data. Some systematics studies, however, go beyond the usual boundaries of
collecting data and building trees. Two examples are
cospeciation analysis [24] and the study of species richness [25]. A cospeciation study usually follows two taxonomic schemes: one for the host species, and one for the
parasites. Parasites are of particular interest in systematics
because of the shared history of the host and the parasite
[24,26]. The analysis involves comparing the phylogenies
of the parasite and the host. These phylogenies either need
to be collected from the literature or built from morphological or sequence data. For the data that are collected, literature searches are normally conducted using the species
or higher taxa names as the search terms. Similarly, a
study of the parasite species richness of a group of organisms also uses two taxonomic schemes and involves collecting data using taxon names as search terms [27]. These
examples exemplify that more studies now require gathering, not just previously published data in order to stay upto-date, but also, data collection for further analysis.
Another example, where collecting data is integral to the
study, is in building super trees [28,29].

Within super tree analyses, data from several studies are
gathered using taxon names as search terms. Once these
data are collected, the taxonomic names across these data
need to be synonymised. Usually, this is done through
one authoritative source, for example, Beck et. al. [30]
used Mammal Species of the World [31]; and Thomas et.
al. [32] used the taxonomy of Sibley and Monroe [33].
Where one such data source exists, this is a simple task,
however, the time is approaching when super trees go
beyond the use of one taxonomic source [5].
The main use of taxonomic data outside its immediate
user community is in information retrieval, as the examples above show. Names are used as the keys to retrieve
data [34-36]. Currently, no one taxonomic data provider
supports the needs of the systematics community. Despite
TreeBASE being the only repository for phylogenetic data,
systematists prefer to gather the data they require for their
analysis through literature searches. In most cases, once
data are retrieved, the search results are examined by eye
to determine if they contain the phylogenetic data of
interest. Since TreeBASE does not provide a complete phylogenetic data resource, literature searches still have to be
performed to ensure thoroughness. Unlike the major
sequence databases, phylogenetic tree data does not have
to be deposited in a database before it can be published.

Currently, the deposition of data in TreeBASE has been
voluntary. Also, TreeBASE is not exploited fully because
data are difficult to retrieve using search terms that are
intuitive to users. Although TreeBASE provides a taxon
name search, the returned data are often incomplete. Our
hypothesis was that an integrated taxonomic data source
could alleviate the problems of using taxonomic names to
retrieve data from TreeBASE. Using taxon queries performed on http://www.treebase.org, we show a significant
improvement in data retrieval when the same queries
were expanded using TCl-Db tables linked to TreeBASE.
The following sections describe the taxonomic requirements of TreeBASE, and follow on with a description of
TCl-Db, the data warehouse that was developed to meet
these needs.
Taxonomic Requirements of TreeBASE
TreeBASE [8] is a phylogenetic and evolutionary information store containing phylogenies for more than 100,000
taxa. Despite the intrinsic taxonomic content, at design,
the developers of TreeBASE purposely excluded taxonomy
[8]. The TreeBASE interface http://www.treebase.org supports six query types: author, citation, study accession
number, matrix accession number, taxon and structure.
The taxon search, however, does not perform adequately,
as it does not effectively support higher taxa queries or
synonym and vernacular queries.

From a biologist's perspective, the taxon search option
does not return the expected results. The query term 'Aves'
currently returns 5 studies (S281, S880, S296, S1166,
S433). On closer inspection, there are many more studies
containing Aves (birds) within TreeBASE, for example the
search term Gallus returns a further 2 studies (S1522,
S606) and Diomedea returns 1 more study (S351). Similarly, the search term Puffinus returns no studies, however,
using the search terms Puffinus tenuirostris or Puffinus
gravis, the study S714 in which they are located is
returned. The species Puffinus gravis is also contained in
the study S351, however, a search using the taxon name is
not successful because the node in the tree is labelled
'Puffinus gravis U74354'. These examples show that
higher taxa terms such as 'Aves' and Puffinus are not being
expanded to include the scientific names they subsume.
Queries performed on TreeBASE return only data where
the search term matches exactly a term contained in the
study. As such, the term 'birds', which is the vernacular
associated with Aves, returns no data because it is not contained in any study. Similarly, the name Phoebastria
albatrus, does not return the study S714 in which the currently accepted valid name Diomedea albatrus, exists. The
taxonomic content and structure of TreeBASE does not
support these queries, as query terms are not expanded to
include associated terms and, as a result, only partial
results are returned. The current data retrieval options

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/93

within TreeBASE pose a problem for the research community who commonly use taxonomic names as search
terms. The research hypothesis studied in this paper is that
data retrieval from TreeBASE can be improved by the
inclusion of a taxonomic and linguistic infrastructure (a
dictionary of synonyms and vernaculars).
The taxonomic requirements that TreeBASE should support are: 1) search terms should expand to include subordinate terms in the classification if they are higher taxa, 2)
vernacular queries should be supported and expand
appropriately to include the data linked to the scientific
names, and 3) any given query should also expand to
include data associated with synonyms and out of date
usage of a taxon name. These queries are currently not
supported by TreeBASE. The developers of TreeBASE purposely excluded taxonomy [8] because there were too
many difficulties for a small development team to overcome. The inclusion of a taxonomic infrastructure still
poses several challenges. The distributed nature of taxon
names and the many data sources in which these are held
is a significant problem, as few sources cover the breadth
of taxonomic coverage required by TreeBASE. Also, each
taxonomic data source uses a particular classification
scheme supporting specific taxonomic opinions. Not only
do data sources differ in the content they deliver but, even
those with similar content may follow different taxonomic opinions and therefore deliver very different classification schemes.
These challenges may be addressed by combining the content of multiple taxonomic data sources and integrating
the data into a form that will enable the taxon query
extensions we postulate. TCl-Db, a Taxonomy and Classification Database, was developed to increase the accessibility and transparency of taxonomic data by integrating
data from the available data sources. It was designed to
provide a taxonomic infrastructure to TreeBASE and supports the queries systematists wish to perform.

Construction and content
TCl-Db, a Taxonomy and Classification Database
TCl-Db provides a merged view of taxonomic data
through a single point of access. The database integrates
taxonomic data from several distributed data sources.
Architecturally, it forms a warehouse in which taxonomic
names from the prominent taxonomic data sources ITIS
[22], NCBI [37] and Sp2000 [38] are replicated and maintained in a common structure. These were selected as data
sources because of their data content and the ease of
downloading and replicating the data structure. Several
Aves Checklists [39-43] were made available to us from
the early bird project [44], these were initially added in
order to evaluate the potential of TCl-Db for data cleaning. Additional checklists data that were requested were

Mammal Species of the World [31] and the taxonomic
data from GRIN, Germplasm Resources Information Network [45]. A full list of contributing data sources is given
in Table 1.
TCl-Db was designed at the early stages of this project,
between 2003 and 2004. A full description of the database
design and implementation, and an Entity Relationship
Diagram (ERD) can be found at http://spira.zool
ogy.gla.ac.uk/doc.php. The design phase of TCl-Db identified the entities that support the requirements presented
at the start of this section. The entities are as follows. A
NAME represents a taxon name. SYNONYMNAME is a taxon
name that, although once used as a valid name, was
replaced with a new valid name. VERNACULARNAME represents a name used in common language to represent an
organism. NAMESOURCE represents the data source from
which each NAME entity originated. TREE represents a classification that can be built based on data from a NAMESOURCE and NODES represent the structure of the TREE. The
physical database design, implemented using the Oracle
database management system [46], is shown in Figure 1.
The many to many relationship between NAME and NAMESOURCE is resolved with an association entity, ASSERTION.
As well as ensuring the taxonomic names in TCl-Db are
tightly bound to their data sources, the ASSERTION entity
also increases transparency, by making conflicts and differences between data sources more obvious. This is useful when comparing the composition and data quality of
data sources.
The design ensures that each taxon name entering the
warehouse is tightly linked to its data source and data

source classification. This supplements the concept of
data provenance [47,48] and is achieved through the
attribute dbsource_id. The dbsource_ids are the database
identifiers used at the database source, for example the
ITIS dbsource_id for Aves is 174371. These identifiers
were stored so that they could be used to link back to the
original data source.
Hierarchical Query Support
To support hierarchical queries on TreeBASE, TCl-Db
stores multiple classifications giving users the option to
choose which hierarchy to traverse in a query. An example
of a hierarchical query is the family name Crocodylidae. In
a hierarchical query this search term would include all the
subordinate terms within this family name, i.e., the genera and species names.

TCl-Db supports three forms of hierarchical queries:
Nested sets [49], Materialized Paths [50] and Oracle's
'Connect By' [51]. The calculation of the Nested set and
Materialized Path data is depicted in Figure 2. Figure 2a is
an example hierarchy with the nodes numerically
labelled. The same tree is depicted in Figure 2b, with the
nodes labelled with their materialised path and Figure 2c
is the summativity representation. Nested sets (Figure 2c)
represent a tree using two numbers a left_id and a
right_id, the columns left_id and right_id in table NODE
(see Figure 1). These left_id and right_ids (nested sets) are
calculated using the summativity representation given in
Figure 2c. For example, Nodes 10 and 11 are contained
within Node 4 which is contained within Node 1. The
nested sets reflect this containment, Node 1 having the
largest (most inclusive) set of 1, 22. Node 4 has the set

Figure Database Tables
TCl-Db 1
TCl-Db Database Tables. TCl-Db tables represent the database implementation. PK means primary key, FK means foreign
key, U stands for a uniqueness constraint, and I indicates an integrity constraint (in the table ASSERTION there is a check constraint on the column dbsource_id). In database terminology tables are called relations and columns are called attributes, while
the other concepts express integrity constraints which guarantee data quality. Here, we use the terms tables and columns
when we refer to the physical model which additionally includes a number of materialised views and database functions and
procedures. Those are used during database updates, to keep track of unique identifiers and to maintain referential integrity.

(16, 21) which, includes its children Nodes 10 (17,18)
and 11 (19,20). The hierarchical query to select all children of node 4 is a simple numerical calculation, see Additional file 1 (Query 1) for an example SQL query using the
nested set left_id and right_id. This query uses the function GET_NAME_TEXT which for a given taxon, returns the
children of that taxon within the specified hierarchy.

using materialised paths). The SQL query uses the property that each node inherits its parent path, therefore all
children of a node can be selected based on its path being
a prefix of the path of its parent. This query uses an additional function GET_ID which returns name_id for a given
name, simplifying the query so that it does not require any
table joins.

The materialized paths are calculated through a tree walk
where a count is incremented as a node is encountered
within each level and a new count is created when moving
down a level. For example, the root of the tree, the uppermost level, has the path 1/ and the level below inherits
this root path and an additional count reflecting their
position below the root. For the two nodes below the
root, the path 1/1 is given to Node 2 and 1/2 to Node 4.
Nodes 10 and 11 are a level below Node 4 and gain their
parent path 1/2 and a new count indicating their location
within their parent path thus giving them the paths 1/2/1
and /1/2/2, and so on. Materialised paths are stored in the
NODE table in the column path as shown in Figure 1, (see
Additional file 1, Query 2, for an example SQL query

Finally, columns name_id and parent_name_id in the
table NODE are used by the 'Connect By' clause (see Additional file 1, Query 3). This method uses the hierarchical
relationship modelled as a self-referencing relation. This
is the simplest method of modelling the hierarchical relationship between nodes, however, the 'Connect By' clause
is specific to Oracle. The addition of the nested sets and
materialized paths makes the database portable to other
database management systems such as MySQL or PostgreSQL.
Vernacular Queries and Query Expansion Techniques

valid names through the table VERNACULARS. This supports
query expansion of synonyms and vernaculars to Latin
names. An example query for the term 'crocodiles' is
shown in Additional file 1 as Query 4.

Utility
TCl-Db was used to test the following hypothesis: Data
retrieval using taxonomic search terms in TreeBASE can be significantly improved by using a data warehouse of integrated
taxonomic names and their classifications.
Data Sets
The data sets used in this study are summarised in Table
2. The upper section of Table 2 refers to data in the databases TCl-Db and TreeBASE. The lower section of Table 2
refers to data from the TreeBASE query log and the AOL
query log. We see within this table that, 29,035 TreeBASE
taxa (within the local version of TreeBASE database) were
mapped to TCl-Db taxa, and the number of taxon queries
from the TreeBASE query log that mapped to the data
within TCl-Db were 27,239.
Data Retrieval from TreeBASE
TreeBASE Taxon Search Log
The TreeBASE web interface, available at the URL http://
www.treebase.org, allows users to conduct taxon queries,
queries by a specific matrix identifier, study or tree identifier. These queries return the phylogenetic studies that
contain the term that was used in the search. In this study
the database structure of TreeBASE was replicated locally
so that SQL queries could use the tables within both TreeBASE and TCl-Db.

The taxon queries on TreeBASE came from a script given
to us by the TreeBASE developers. The script returned all
queries performed using the taxon field in the TreeBASE
user interface. These queries and the number of times
these queries had been performed were loaded into a
database table and given unique identifiers. The data were
initially trimmed to remove trailing spaces. Duplicates

were removed and so were other non taxon searches, such
as queries based on TreeBASE identifiers. There were also
several searches for study authors which were removed by
comparing the queries to the author names stored in TreeBASE. GenBank Accession number queries were also
removed from the data set. The remaining 62,126 queries
were then mapped to TCl-Db giving 27,239 distinct taxon
queries. Using these 27,239 queries, we compare the data
returned in response to the queries directly against a local
copy of TreeBASE, downloaded in 2006, and through the
wrapper software which uses both TreeBase and TCl-Db.
The number of queries that do not return any TreeBASE
data is significantly higher than the number of queries
that do (16,018 against 11,221). Approximately 50% of
the queries posed on TreeBASE were higher taxa queries
(of rank genus and above) while 28% were species queries. Of the valid name queries posed against TreeBASE,
71% do not return data, with 94% of the vernacular and
85% of the synonym queries also returning no data. This
analysis of the query logs shows that users have been experiencing very poor data retrieval.
TCl-Db hierarchical query expansion improves data retrieval
Tables 3 and 4 compare the query effectiveness of TreeBASE alone and TreeBASE terms expanded with taxonomy
data from TCl-Db with regard to genus queries in Table 3
and higher taxa in Table 4. Overall, for 6,622 genera queries that return no data in TreeBASE, hierarchical query
expansion via TCl-Db produces 1,127 trees. The most significant improvement in the number of trees found is

The number of species within each genus for ITIS, NCBI and Sp2000. Each source shows varied species content for each genus, most notably for
Pinus and Drosophila. The last two columns are: the number of trees returned for the genus queries performed directly on TreeBASE; and the
number of additional trees returned using species names found using all three classifications in a hierarchical query in TCl-Db.

which returns two trees. While vernaculars are not the
most frequently used search terms, TCl-Db allows these
terms to expand to Latin names. For example, 'acacia'
(Latin Robinia pseudoacacia) returns no data in TreeBASE,
while the Latin term, related to acacia, returns 2 trees, and
'yeast' (Latin Saccharomyces cerevisiae) has no direct hits in
TreeBASE, but returns 70 trees when TCl-Db is used (a
similar observation was made by Jensen et al in [6]). In
TCl-Db, the inclusion of the alternative Latin names significantly improves the quality of data retrieval. For those
queries that translate to higher taxa names, data retrieval
can be further enhanced by performing a hierarchical
query.
Expanding search terms with synonyms also improves
data retrieval. There were 868 synonym queries that
returned no data using TreeBASE. In response to these
queries, TCl-Db returned 594 trees by expanding the
search term with valid names linked to synonyms.
An alternative query log from AOL [52] was analysed for
taxon searches. Taxon searches were extracted from this
log for the purposes of providing a test set of queries that
can be used to test our TCl-Db TreeBASE wrapper. Surprisingly, from the AOL data we see that vernacular queries
were only marginally more frequent than scientific name
queries (see Table 2) i.e. 3590 against 3076 out of the
8281 AOL taxon queries.

TCl-Db Provides Taxonomic Awareness for TreeBASE
The lack of taxonomic content in TreeBASE is responsible
for poor data retrieval. Previous studies have also highlighted this. The taxon names in a 2004 snapshot of TreeBASE were mapped previously to the databases IPNI, ITIS,
NCBI, and uBio in TBmap [53], and this work comments
on the importance of internal consistency within a database system and the requirement for data validation. TClDb can also be used for this purpose and part of that analysis was replicated here in an automated way. Through SQL
queries we mapped 28,876 TreeBASE taxa to taxa in TClDb. The distribution of TreeBASE names, grouped by taxonomic rank, is shown in Table 6. This shows that the
majority of TreeBASE names are species, while the majority of queries performed on TreeBASE are higher taxa. It is
not surprising, therefore, that data retrieval is poor. The
lack of taxonomic support in TreeBASE means that queries
do not return data because the query terms are not understood by the system. One way to improve this, as shown
above, is to increase 'the vocabulary' of the database. The
superimposition of a taxonomy onto the TreeBASE structure makes sure the queries are understood by the system
and makes it significantly more user friendly.

Although a number of integrated database systems
already exist and store names from multiple sources, the
classifications of those names are not stored and a user
cannot freely choose the classification that suits their work

Expanding query terms hierarchically increases the number of trees returned from TreeBASE. The first column shows the count of trees found in
TreeBASE. The remaining columns show the number of trees returned using hierarchical query expansion on TreeBASE using Sp2000, ITIS and
NCBI classifications. The table highlights the importance of including more than one hierarchy. For instance, the query 'Metazoa' returns no data
when using the ITIS or Sp2000, and 1014 when using NCBI. Also, for 'Fungi' we see that NCBI and ITIS differ. In some cases the hierarchical query
failed, denoted with an X. For example, as the term 'Archaea' is both a genus and superkingdom in SP2K, the hierarchical query fails.

best. TCl-Db was developed because Sp2000 and uBio
could not meet the requirements we gathered. The specific
shortcoming of Sp2000 was that it did not support multiple classifications, while uBio could not effectively link to
TreeBASE. However, uBio extended its services to include
classifications [54] which is accessible only through a web
service.
TCl-Db supports a number of novel functions not included
within other systems. First, it performs hierarchical
searches through a choice of three classifications. Providing a higher taxon name as a query returns names contained within the hierarchy. Second, it expands terms
(with synonyms and vernaculars) to include valid names
that are associated with them. These queries are similar to
'drill down' browsing searches and 'fuzzy' queries using
generalised terms. These queries are supported by a local
copy of TreeBASE accessed through a web based wrapper.

The interface to TCl-Db provides both a search form (Figure 3) and a classification browse page (Figure 4) which
returns either TreeBASE treeids or studyids which link to the
current online TreeBASE interface via hyper links. The web
interface enables the user to enter vernacular names as
search terms. These searches return a list of linked taxon
names from which the user can select. For example, entering the search term 'birds' will return a link to the term
'Aves'. The search form also enables the user to use an
approximate spelling, as in Google's 'did you mean' link.
For example, the search term 'Caenorabditis' returns no
data but suggests 'Caenorhabditis' as an alternative. Hierarchical queries are also supported. Once a search term is
entered, the system returns a list of classifications. Once a
classification is selected, the query expands to subordinate
terms within the classification and each term is searched
through TreeBASE. Additionally, a browse function is supported. It allows the users to first select which hierarchy

they wish to browse (ITIS, NCBI or Sp2000), and then
select the taxon for which they want to retrieve data.

Discussion
The version of TreeBASE on which this analysis was based
is to be replaced by CIPRES as TreeBASE2 [23]. Although
a prototype was due for release in July 2006, it is not available yet. The new improved TreeBASE schema has a Taxon
module which looks to rectify many of the data retrieval
issues currently experienced by users. It is difficult to see
from the available documentation and schema exactly
how hierarchical and vernacular queries will be supported
in TreeBASE2, and until the system comes online, our web
application makes clear the advantages of supporting
taxon queries, and the benefits of query expansion.
Phylofinder [9] also shows how data retrieval can be
improved with the inclusion of a taxonomy. It uses the
NCBI classification and makes use of TBmap [53] to deal
with taxa names that are not included in NCBI. On the
whole, Phylofinder does improve data retrieval, however,
the inclusion of just one classification limits the higher
taxon queries that can be performed to only those

TreeBASE taxon content within the TreeBASE taxon query log. The
difference between the distribution of taxon names in TreeBASE and

TreeBASE are species (left) while the types of queries performed on

included in NCBI and TBmap. Table 7 shows a selection
of higher taxa terms from the ITIS classification, and
shows that data retrieval in Phylofinder is still limited, as
for instance the query 'Craspedomonadales' returns no
hits in Phylofinder and 35 when TCl-Db is used, and
'Pinales', with no hits in Phylofinder, brings 37 trees when
routed via TCl-Db. This is partly due to the fact that
TBmap has a restricted scope, as not only is the mapping
based on a 2004 snapshot of TreeBASE, but also the mappings are limited to the taxa contained in TreeBASE. As a
result, many higher taxa queries are not well supported.
Although TCl-Db, uses a 2006 snapshot of TreeBASE it is
only marginally outperformed by Phylofinder which uses
a more recent version of TreeBASE. The queries 'Aves' and
'Puffinus', exemplified originally, return 1 more tree and
6 more trees respectively in Phylofinder. The inclusion of
more than one classification scheme and the support for
vernacular queries make the approach used by TCl-Db
superior to that used by Phylofinder. Phylofinder is based
on mappings that are already out of date, therefore, its
shelf life is limited, whereas TCl-Db performs mappings
to TreeBASE automatically, and, therefore, will be able to
provide a more useful resource in the long term.

Future work
Data Freshness
One of the challenges is data maintenance within TCl-Db.
Even though the system was developed with TreeBASE as
the primary source of phylogeny data, there may be other
database systems that could benefit from the inclusion of
a taxonomy. We need to keep data sets current for the system to be useful in the long term and to other consumers.
Updates to NCBI and ITIS classifications have been performed manually and the process has highlighted maintenance issues that need to be addressed to support
automated updates which would keep the data current.

This is the focus of current work. Currently data updates
are performed when requested, we endeavour to update
the ITIS and NCBI data at least yearly. The addition of new
or updated checklist data can be added on request.
Semantic Web Technologies
The core of TCl-Db work is data integration. From the
database perspective, data warehousing and data integration [55] involve gathering data from several silos and
mapping those into a common schema. Integration is
achieved by issuing queries on this common structure. On
the web, however, data are not integrated physically but
are linked using URLs, which provides a certain degree of
flexible adjustment, as sources evolve. In the next generation of the web, resources, given correct meta-data [56],

could be linked automatically via ontological annotations
[57]. Semantically annotated data will have meaning to
computers and not just to the users browsing them [58],
which enables automatic data matching, integration and
translation. Semantic web technologies should be able to
support automated linking of phylogenetic and taxonomic resources [59]. Making taxonomic data interoperable [60] would be of great benefit, as it would remove the
need for carefully orchestrated updates, which would be
replaced by distributed web querying. Also, the distributed nature of systematics lends itself to the semantic web
ethos. Potentially, semantic web technologies will reduce
the need for data warehousing, and replace the centralised
approach to data management with a distributed one
[61]. The future development of TCl-Db will make use of

semantic technologies for data integration and support
greater interoperability of taxonomy and phylogeny systems.

Conclusion
The lack of taxonomic intelligence in TreeBASE makes
data retrieval ineffective in some cases. Our hypothesis
that data retrieval can be improved through the inclusion
of taxonomic meta-data is well substantiated. We clearly
show that where TreeBASE finds little data, TCl-Db delivers improved results. TCl-Db provides an infrastructure
supporting effective data retrieval within TreeBASE by
using taxon names as search terms. The analysis we pre-

sented shows the importance of this meta-data in supporting queries found in query logs. Additionally, via the
inclusion of vernaculars and synonyms, additional data
can be found in TreeBASE. The use of an amalgamated taxonomy data warehouse also addressed the issues of taxonomic coverage and the differing opinions in taxonomy,
and supports the comparison of taxonomy and data coverage in several contexts.
