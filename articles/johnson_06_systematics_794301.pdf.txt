Abstract
Background: Populations of the Oriental White-backed Vulture (Gyps bengalensis) have declined by over 95% within the past
decade. This decline is largely due to incidental consumption of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory veterinary pharmaceutical
diclofenac, commonly used to treat domestic livestock. The conservation status of other Gyps vultures in southern Asia is also
of immediate concern, given the lack of knowledge regarding status of their populations and the continuing existence of
taxonomic uncertainties. In this study, we assess phylogenetic relationships for all recognized species and the majority of
subspecies within the genus Gyps. The continuing veterinary use of diclofenac is an unknown but potential risk to related species
with similar feeding habits to Gyps bengalensis. Therefore, an accurate assessment of the phylogenetic relationships among Gyps
vultures should aid in their conservation by clarifying taxonomic uncertainties, and enabling inference of their respective
relatedness to susceptible G. bengalensis.
Results: Phylogenetic results using mitochondrial cytB, ND2 and control region sequence data indicate a recent and rapid
diversification within the genus Gyps. All recognized species formed monophyletic groups with high statistical support, with the
exception of the Eurasian Vulture, for which specimens identified as subspecies G. fulvus fulvescens appear closely related to the
Himalayan Vulture (G. himalayensis). In all analyses, the earliest divergence separated the Oriental White-backed Vulture from
other Gyps taxa, with the next diverging taxon being either the African White-backed Vulture (G. africanus), or the Himalayan
Vulture. All analyses supported a sister relationship between the Eurasian Vulture (G. f. fulvus), and Rüppell's Vulture (G.
rueppellii), with this clade being sister to another consisting of the two taxa of "Long-billed" Vulture (G. indicus indicus and G. i.
tenuirostris), and the Cape Vulture (G. coprotheres). These molecular phylogenies strongly support the treatment of indicus and
tenuirostris as separate species, as does morphological data showing that these two taxa of similar overall size differ in
proportions, especially in rostral, alar, and pedal characters. In addition, grouping of bengalensis and africanus together in the
genus Pseudogyps, as historically proposed, is not upheld based on mitochondrial data.
Conclusion: Both molecular and morphological data provide strong support for considering the "Long-billed" Vulture to be
comprised of two species (G. indicus and G. tenuirostris), and further analysis is warranted to determine the taxonomic
distinctiveness of G. f. fulvescens. Our phylogenetic analyses and conservative estimates suggest the diversification of Gyps taxa
to be within the past 6 million years. Diclofenac susceptibility has been previously demonstrated for four Gyps species (G. indicus,
G. fulvus, G. africanus, G. bengalensis), and the phylogenetic position of these species each forming a sister relationship with at
least one of the remaining species, support concern that other Gyps taxa may be susceptible as well. Determining genetic and
evolutionary distinctiveness for Gyps lineages is increasingly important as a breeding program is being established to prevent
extinction.

Background
Three Old World vulture taxa in the genus Gyps have
recently been listed as critically endangered by The World
Conservation Union [1]. These are the Oriental Whitebacked, or White-rumped Vulture (G. bengalensis) and two
taxa long treated together as "Long-billed" (G. indicus indicus and G. i. tenuirostris) Vultures. All three share similar
feeding behaviours, typically scavenging the soft tissues of
large mammals [2,3]. This behaviour, along with their
propensity to form colonies or aggregate at carcasses in
large feeding groups often near human settlements, has
likely contributed to their recent precipitous decline. Population declines (> 95%) of these three taxa over the past
decade have been well documented. Gyps bengalensis, in
particular, were abundant as little as ten years ago in both
Pakistan and India, with nesting densities recorded as
high as 12 nests/km2 in Keoladeo National Park in northern India [4-9]. In fact, their decline as a significant scavenger has likely led to associated changes within their
environment and has implications for human health and
disease [8-11].
Oaks et al. [12] identified the apparent cause for this
decline in G. bengalensis as diclofenac, a non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical commonly used to
treat domestic livestock. Vultures consume diclofenac in
the carcasses of treated animals, and then experience renal
failure and visceral gout followed by mortality within 48
hours of ingestion [12-14]. The toxicity of this drug to
non-domesticated animals other than Gyps vultures is not
known; however, direct evidence indicates that diclofenac
causes mortality in at least four of the Gyps taxa (e.g., G.
bengalensis, G. i. indicus, G. fulvus fulvus, and G. africanus)
[12,14,15].
What has been missing up to this point in Gyps conservation efforts is detailed consideration of their phylogeny
and taxonomy. Taxonomic uncertainties remain, and
resolving them can help the scientific and conservation
communities in identifying and recognizing taxa at risk,
in identifying their critical habitats and geographic ranges,
and in promoting policies to benefit species welfare. Having well supported phylogenies and resultant taxonomies
can also be useful for assessing priority in allocating limited funds for captive breeding and other conservation
efforts [see [16-18]]. The extent of diclofenac susceptibility among species is not well known, though it is not
unreasonable to suspect a phylogenetic component. Thus,
phylogenies can help set priorities for testing susceptibility among close relatives with similar life histories.
Species traditionally treated within Gyps are: the African
White-backed Vulture (G. africanus), Cape Vulture (G.
coprotheres), and Rüppell's Vulture (G. rueppellii) in Africa;
the Oriental White-backed, or White-rumped, Vulture (G.

bengalensis), Long-billed Vulture (G. indicus), and Himalayan Vulture (G. himalayensis) in Asia; and the Eurasian
Vulture (G. fulvus) in Europe, Africa and Asia [19-22] (Fig.
1). As treated in these sources, Gyps indicus, G. rueppellii,
and G. fulvus are polytypic. In a number of earlier references, G. bengalensis and G. africanus have been classified
together as a separate genus, Pseudogyps, due primarily to
a smaller body size and a reduced number of rectrices (12
vs. 14) compared to other Gyps taxa [3,23-25]. In addition, proposals have been made to consider the "Longbilled" Vulture as two separate species based on morphological differences [26-31], and the taxonomic status of
the two subspecies of Eurasian Vulture (G. f. fulvus and G.
f. fulvescens), as well as their characteristics and geographic
distribution are unclear. To date, taxonomic relationships
among Gyps taxa, including subspecies relationships,
remain to be assessed with molecular sequence characters,
and the validity of fulvescens, which has not been considered in recent times [27,28,32], clearly warrants further
study.
Here we assess phylogenetic relationships among all currently recognized Gyps species using molecular methods.
Some taxa from this genus have been incorporated previously in molecular phylogenetic studies [33-35]; however,
none of these studies included all recognized Gyps taxa.
Indeed, G. indicus (including tenuirostris), G. himalayensis,
and G. f. fulvescens have never been included in a molecular phylogenetic study. Therefore, this is the first attempt
to ascertain Gyps systematics based on samples of all recognized species using molecular techniques. We include
morphological data and analyses to further investigate
taxonomic status of the two "Long-billed" Vulture taxa (G.
i. indicus and G. i. tenuirostris).

Results
Sequence characteristics
Among 60 representative individuals from the genus Gyps
using complete mitochondrial (mt) cytochrome B (cytB)
sequence data (1024 bp), 27 unique haplotypes were distinguished based on 81 variable sites (76 transitions and
five transversions). Combined analysis of 2092 characters
from mt cytB and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2
(ND2), from a smaller set of individuals (n = 20), identified 16 unique haplotypes based on 131 variable sites
(121 transitions and 10 transversions) among ingroup
taxa. For 400 bp of mt control region (CR), 15 unique
haplotypes were identified for 20 individual Gyps vultures,
including 29 variable sites (25 transitions, four transversions and one indel). When CR was combined with corresponding cytB and ND2 sequence data, 19 unique
haplotypes based on 160 variable sites were observed
among 20 individual Gyps vultures. Uncorrected percent
sequence divergence between taxa was similar across loci
with CR showing slightly higher divergence estimates;

Nucleotide composition varied slightly between cytB and
ND2 with both loci displaying lower levels of guanine (13

and 10%, respectively) and higher levels of cytosine (34

possessed lower levels of guanine (19%); however, it differed from cytB and ND2 in showing higher levels of
thymine (32%) nucleotides. Tests for departure from

for all three loci analyzed separately or combined (χ2, P >
0.05).
Phylogenetic analyses
The AIC identified the GTR+G model of sequence evolution [36] for analyses of both cytB and ND2. When partitioned by codon position, GTR+G, HKY+I, and HKY
models were selected for each successive codon position
(1st, 2nd, and 3rd, respectively) for cytB, and HKY+G,
HKY+I, and GTR+I models were selected for each successive codon position for ND2. The CR was analyzed with
equal weights among characters in all analyses. The same
topology was found in both MP and Bayesian analyses

irrespective of utilizing codon positions for the Bayesian
cytB analyses and also for each of the two multi-locus
datasets; however, the mixed models provided increased
support indices at most nodes for all data sets, and therefore, only the support indices while utilizing codon partitions are shown for the Bayesian results (Figs. 2, 3).
Regardless of dataset (single or multi-locus), monophyly
of the genus Gyps and each species was strongly supported
with high bootstrap support and posterior probabilities
for each clade (Figs. 2, 3). The high number of nucleotide
differences consistently observed between taxa further
highlight these diagnostic relationships (Table 1). No geographic partitioning was observed within species or sub-

and G. f. fulvus; data not shown). However, within G. indicus, the Long-billed (G. i. indicus) and the Slender-billed
(G. i. tenuirostris) vultures formed two separate monophyletic clades with high statistical support. Similarly,
representative individuals of the two subspecies of Eurasian Vulture, G. f. fulvus and G. f. fulvescens were phylogenetically distinct; however, they were not placed as sister
taxa. Both fulvescens samples clustered with the Himalayan Vulture (G. himalayensis; Figs. 2, 3). One of the two
birds identified as G. f. fulvescens had an identical CR hap-

lotype and differed by a single nucleotide from four of the
six and all of the himalayensis haplotypes in cytB and ND2,
respectively (Table 1; Additional file 1). DNA extractions
for these taxa were conducted separately with multiple
independent PCR amplifications to verify these results
and to help rule out the possibility of contamination.
There were a few differences in sister relationships among
Gyps species when comparing results from different datasets (i.e., whether analyses were conducted for each locus
separately or combined with others; Figs. 2, 3). The CR

analysis identified monophyletic species similar to cytB
and ND2; however, further resolution was limited with all
species forming a single polytomy (tree not shown).
When ND2 was analyzed separately (tree not shown), its
topology was identical to that provided by the combined
cytB and ND2 results (Fig. 3), while the topology for cytB
alone differed from results given by the multi-locus datasets. In all analyses, the earliest divergence separated G.
bengalensis from all other Gyps taxa; however, whether the
next divergence is for G. africanus or G. himalayensis/G. f.
fulvescens varies by dataset analyzed, with G. africanus
divergence supported as the second divergence within
Gyps by cytB and ND2 combined as well as the cytB, ND2
and CR combined dataset. All analyses supported a sister
relationship between G. f. fulvus and G. rueppellii, with this
clade sister to a clade consisting of G. i. indicus, G. i. tenuirostris, and G. coprotheres, and with the latter taxa forming
a polytomy in the combined cytB and ND2 analyses without CR (Fig. 3A). In the multi-locus dataset including the
CR (Fig. 3B), G. i. tenuirostris and G. coprotheres are posited
as sisters with only weak statistical support.

Long-billed Vulture morphological analyses
Although the two taxa long classified as subspecies of
"Long-billed" Vulture (G. i. indicus and G. i. tenuirostris)
are similar in overall size, they differ markedly in proportions (Table 2). The rostrum of tenuirostris is much longer
than that of indicus (as shown by culmen length and bill
length from gape), while in indicus the rostrum is deeper
and broader (as shown by bill width, bill depth, and maxilla depth). The longer skull and mandibular symphysis of
tenuirostris is probably also a reflection of its relatively
longer bill. The nostrils (nares length) of indicus are much
longer than tenuirostris (reflecting the ovate shape of the
nostril of indicus vs. the round nares of tenuirostris). In
wing proportions, the "arm" (ulna length) and alula of
tenuirostris are longer than for indicus while the "hand"
(wing length) is longer in indicus. Lengths of individual
primaries measured from the carpal joint did not differ
significantly between the taxa and are not presented here.
For the pes, most elements of tenuirostris are significantly
longer than those of indicus, with the exception of the
claws of digits 1 and 2, whereas pedal elements of indicus
are proportionately more similar to those of tenuirostris in
width and breadth measures.

In a Principal Components Analysis (PCA), Factor 1 was a
highly significant (P ≤ 0.001) shape axis distinguishing
indicus and tenuirostris specimens (Table 3). Variables with
high positive loadings on PCA Factor 1 were lengths of
culmen, bill from gape, mandibular symphysis, alula, tarsus, tarsus proximal, tarsus distal, toes (pes digits), and
depth of the claw of digit III. These variables contrasted
with the strongly negatively loading nares length, and to a
lesser extent with bill width, outer rectrix length, and
width of the claw of digit III. Although the first six factors
had eigenvalues above 1, component loadings of indicus
and tenuirostris were significantly different only on Factor
1. Nevertheless, on this axis they were significantly different and readily distinguished (Fig. 4).

Discussion
Our objective in this study is to resolve phylogeny and taxonomic uncertainties for Gyps taxa, in order to inform current conservation efforts. By using museum specimens as
DNA sources along with tissues obtained from the field,
we sampled representatives of all generally recognized
Gyps taxa with emphasis on those geographically distributed in south Asia; the primary area experiencing recent,
drastic population declines. Our analyses support two
changes to the traditional taxonomy for Gyps. First, two
individuals identified as G. f. fulvescens were most closely
related to G. himalayensis (Figs. 2, 3). Relatively high divergence estimates among all G. fulvus individuals (1.5–
2.5%, Table 1) and relatively low divergence estimates
between G. f. fulvescens and G. himalayensis (0.0–0.6%)
reflect this phylogenetic result. Additional sampling and

analyses for G. f. fulvescens are needed to verify these
results. Second, our analyses based on both morphological and molecular data indicate the phylogenetic distinctiveness of the Long-billed and the Slender-billed
Vultures, supporting their taxonomic treatment as distinct
species (e.g., G. indicus and G. tenuirostris, respectively) as
recommended previously [29-31]. Mensural analyses
show that indicus and tenuirostris differ significantly in
proportions, especially of the head, wing, and pes (Table
2), and all individuals in each taxon are clearly separated
on at least one axis in a PCA (Table 3). In our molecular
analyses, pairwise sequence divergences between G. indicus and G. tenuirostris are similar to their respective divergence estimates from G. coprotheres (Table 1), and to those
reported between various other broadly recognized species within the family Accipitridae [35]. These results
highlight the utility of molecular phylogenetic methods in
identifying independent evolutionary lineages within a
group that has a long history of taxonomic uncertainty
[3,27,28,32-35,37-39], and, furthermore, help identify
and resolve problematic specimen identifications (i.e., fulvescens; see also [17,40]).

The phylogenetic relationships found among Gyps vultures were largely the same for the different methods and
mt datasets. Despite our finding of monophyly for the
majority of Gyps species, relatively small sequence difference estimates (0.5–3.8%; Table 1) separating some
named species made determination of sister relationships
difficult, and multiple relationships were unresolved due
to low nodal support. This suggests that the Gyps study
taxa stem from relatively rapid and recent diversification
events. If we use a generally supported avian mtDNA
divergence rate for coding regions ranging from 1.6 to
5.0% change per million years (see [41]), our mt cytB and
ND2 sequence divergence estimates (GTR+G; 0.8–3.4%),
indicate that the radiation of Gyps vulture study species
occurred 0.2 to 2.1 million years ago. These estimates
must be considered with caution as they assume clock-like
rates of sequence change, which is known to be violated
in comparisons of some avian taxa and genes (e.g. [4245]). However, we were not able to reject a hypothesis of
clock-like behavior for our particular Gyps sequence dataset using a log likelihood ratio test (-ln Lclock = 3743.13, ln Lnon-clock = 3731.94; 2Δln L = 22.38; d.f. = 18; P > 0.05).

tion in feeding behavior among Gyps vultures is thought
to have evolved due to their close association with ungulate populations, particularly migratory populations in
Africa and Asia. In fact, the observed temporal and geographic diversification of Gyps vultures coincides with the
diversification of Old World ungulates, especially in the
family Bovidae [46-50], and the expansion of grass-dominated ecosystems in Africa and Asia (see [51]). These
close associations likely played a significant role in the
adaptation and rapid diversification of Gyps vultures.
Indeed, Houston [2] proposed that their large body size
and ability to soar over large distances in search for food
are related to the associated migrant distributions and seasonal fluctuations in mortality of ungulates, and that they
have consequently become incapable of actually killing
their own prey (see also [52]).

Factors 1 and 2 for external mensural characters of
Gyps indicus and G. tenuirostris. Gyps indicus and G. tenuirostris are significantly different (P ≤ 0.001) on Factor 1. Individuals with strongly positive scores on Factor 1 are
tenuirostris, which have longer tarsi and toes, but narrower
and longer rostra relative to indicus.
Even if we assume that the above divergence rates are too
high (see [45]), a lower rate (e.g., 0.6% per million years)
still yields divergence times that are quite recent (< 5.7
million years).
These divergence estimates do not necessarily correspond
with geographic proximity or the current distributions of
species. For example, divergence estimates between G.
indicus and both G. coprotheres and G. rueppellii are relatively low (0.9–1.3%; cytB & ND2 combined), yet the species compared occupy different continents. In contrast,
divergence estimates between species with geographically
proximate distributions, G. coprotheres and G. africanus in
Africa and G. i. tenuirostris and G. himalayensis in South
Asia (see Fig. 1) are relatively high (2.9–3.2% and 2.8–
3.1%, respectively).
The historic radiation of this genus likely evolved in environmental conditions that no longer exist to the same
extent throughout their current distributions. Gyps species
are unique among Old World vultures in that they feed
exclusively as scavengers, whereas other vultures are also
known to kill their prey on occasion or, rarely, to feed on
fruits (i.e., Gypohierax angolensis; [2,3,21]. This specializa-

Both molecular and morphological data provide strong
support for considering the "Long-billed" Vulture (G. indicus) to be comprised of two species, the Long-billed Vulture (G. indicus) and the Slender-billed Vulture (G.
tenuirostris), with both considered critically endangered by
the IUCN [1]. We found non-monophyly for our set of
Eurasian Vultures, with both G. f. fulvescens individuals
appearing more closely related to G. himalayensis than to
G. f. fulvus, suggesting a topic for further analysis. Our
phylogenetic analyses indicate the oldest divergence
among Gyps species to be between G. bengalensis and the
others, and conservative estimates suggest the diversification of Gyps taxa to be within the past 6 million years.
The scavenging lifestyle of Gyps vultures and the decline of
their historical food sources has likely contributed to their
increased dependence on habitats heavily impacted by
humans (see [3]). Many Gyps vulture populations have
become increasingly dependent on domesticated animals,
especially cattle, and this has contributed to their catastrophic decline in Pakistan and India, due to their secondary exposure to the veterinary pharmaceutical drug
diclofenac (see [12,13,15,53]). Gyps bengalensis was fairly
recently described as the most abundant large bird of prey
in the world [4], yet, in as little as ten years, this species
has become exceedingly difficult to find in the wild (see
[54] for current trends).
Determining genetic and evolutionary distinctiveness for
Gyps lineages is increasingly important as a captive-breeding program is being established to prevent G. bengalensis
extinction and other Gyps taxa are considered to be at risk
or of uncertain status. Diclofenac susceptibility has been
previously demonstrated for four Gyps species (G. indicus,
G. fulvus, G. africanus, G. bengalensis [12-15]), and the relative recency of diversification and the phylogenetic position of these four known susceptible species each forming

a sister relationship with at least one of the remaining taxa
in this genus, support concern that the other Gyps taxa
may be susceptible as well (see also [11,14]). The most
obvious long-term solution to prevent their extinction is
the immediate removal of diclofenac as a veterinary drug
for domestic livestock. A recent study reported on findings
suggesting that an alternative drug called meloxicam may
serve as a surrogate to diclofenac without causing harm to
Gyps vultures [11]. Fortunately, India has since banned
the manufacture and use of diclofenac [55]; however, the
drug is still available for veterinary use in Pakistan and
vulture populations continue to decline.

Methods
Taxon sampling, DNA extraction, amplification and
sequencing
To infer phylogenetic relationships among Gyps taxa, a
total of 60 individuals were sampled throughout a large
proportion of their geographic range with emphasis on
south Asia (Fig. 1; additional file 1). At least two individuals were sampled from each of the recognized species or
subspecies [19-21] with some taxa having as many as 14
representative individuals depending on the particular
locus utilized in the analyses (see additional file 1). In an
attempt to prevent confusion, we have elected to use "vultures" for the common names used herein, rather than
those often used in which certain species are referred to as
"griffons". This is because our phylogenetic results clearly
demonstrate that "griffons" sensu lato [[20,21]; but see
[3,22]] are not a monophyletic group unless, of course, it
is restricted to a single taxon. Outgroup taxa for mt cytB
and ND2 phylogenetic analyses included the Hooded
Vulture (Necrosyrtes monachus), Red-headed Vulture (Sarcogyps calvus), Monk Vulture (Aegypius monachus), Lappetfaced Vulture (Torgos tracheliotos), and White-headed Vulture (Trigonoceps occipitalis) (see [35]). For analyses including mt CR sequence data, the outgroup taxa were
restricted to N. monachus and S. calvus due to difficulties

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/65

in alignments and presence of indels associated with the
other outgroup taxa.
Total genomic DNA was extracted from blood or from
toe-pad tissue for museum specimens using a DNeasy Tissue Extraction Kit (QIAGEN Inc.). All work with museum
samples was conducted in a facility used only for ancient
DNA work at the University of Michigan Museum of Zoology, with protocols developed for ancient DNAs (e.g.,
[56,57]). PCR amplifications were performed with Platinum Taq (Invitrogen) using primers designed for mt cytB,
ND2 (L5219/H5766 and L5758/H6313; [58]), and
approximately 400 basepairs (bp) from the 5' end of the
control region (Table 4). We obtained nucleotide
sequences for cytB, ND2 and control region from 67, 26,
and 22 representative individuals, respectively, including
outgroup taxa (see additional file 1). Potential contamination was carefully monitored through the use of multiple extraction and PCR controls. PCR products were
directly sequenced in both directions with ABI Big Dye
Terminator chemistry, resolved on an ABI 3730 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems), and deposited in
GenBank [GenBank:DQ908960–DQ909007].
Alignment and phylogenetic analysis
Sequences were aligned by eye. No indels were observed
in cytB or ND2, and the few indels observed in the control
region were readily resolved in alignments, excluding
three of the outgroup taxa (see above). We used both maximum parsimony (MP) and Bayesian inference using
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling
approaches to reconstruct phylogenies. Analyses were
conducted using samples for each locus separately and
combined (cytB/ND2 and cytB/ND2/CR). MP trees were
inferred using PAUP* 4.0b10 [59], and all character-state
changes were equally weighted. All MP analyses were heuristic with starting trees obtained by random taxa addition
with 100 replicates, TBR branch swapping, and support
values for clades were calculated from 1000 bootstrap replicates.

Bayesian analyses were implemented using MrBayes v.
3.0B4 [60,61]. A number of recent studies have shown
that partitioning data by codon position or gene region
can produce less biased posterior probability estimates
and allow a better fit between particular models and their
corresponding sequence data [62-64]. Therefore, the bestfit model of evolution was determined by Akaike information criterion (AIC) in Mr. ModelTest v. 2.0 [36] with bestfit models assessed using information from codon nucleotide positions for cytB and ND2 separately, and equal
weights among nucleotide positions given for the CR (see
Results). All Bayesian analyses were run for six million
generations, of which the first 50 000 generations were
discarded before determining posterior branch probabili-

ties. Four chains in the Bayesian MCMC analyses were
used in each of four independent runs. Each of the independent runs converged on similar optimal log likelihood
scores and identical tree topologies. The criterion of
monophyly was used for diagnosing distinctive evolutionary units and for assessing taxonomic associations.
Long-billed Vulture morphological analyses
External measurements of indicus and tenuirostris were
taken to the nearest 0.1 mm using digital calipers. Measurements taken were: skull length, which is from distal tip
of culmen to caudal end of cranium (only taken on specimens for which the rear cranium was not removed, determined by palpation); culmen length from the caudal edge
of the cere; bill width and depth measured just proximal
of the cere; greatest depth of the maxilla; nares length,
which is the length of the nostril taken from the internal
rim; gape width taken at the caudal limit of the rictus; bill
length from gape, which is measured from the caudal
limit of the rictus to the distal tip of the culmen; mandibular symphysis length measured from its caudal-most to
distal-most limits; tail length from the base (junction of
feather and skin) of the central rectrix; outer rectrix length
from its base; length of ulna; wing and alula lengths from
carpal joint; greatest tarsus length, proximal breadth, minimum shaft breadth, and distal breadth; lengths of each
pedal digit measured in plantar aspect from the proximal
limit of metatarsus I to the proximal limit of the claw;
lengths of each claw measured from proximal to distalmost limits; and maximum width and depth of pes digit 3
claw.

We conducted Principal Components Analyses (PCA) for
the morphological measurements to assess potential phenotypic distinctiveness of indicus and tenuirostris using a
correlation matrix in Systat 8.0. Sexes were pooled as preliminary univariate statistical analyses and PCA showed
no differences in size between the sexes, and because sex
was not identified for many of the museum specimens for
these two taxa. Measurements were also tested for significant differences using two-sample t-tests using the program Systat 8.0, with P-values ≤ 0.001 indicating
significance after correcting for multiple comparisons
