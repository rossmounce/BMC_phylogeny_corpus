Abstract
Background: The multiplicity or loss of the vitellogenin (vtg) gene family in vertebrates has been
argued to have broad implications for the mode of reproduction (placental or non-placental),
cleavage pattern (meroblastic or holoblastic) and character of the egg (pelagic or benthic). Earlier
proposals for the existence of three forms of vertebrate vtgs present conflicting models for their
origin and subsequent duplication.
Results: By integrating phylogenetics of novel vtg transcripts from old and modern teleosts with
syntenic analyses of all available genomic variants of non-metatherian vertebrates we identify the
gene orthologies between the Sarcopterygii (tetrapod branch) and Actinopterygii (fish branch). We
argue that the vertebrate vtg gene cluster originated in proto-chromosome m, but that vtg genes
have subsequently duplicated and rearranged following whole genome duplications. Sequencing of
a novel fourth vtg transcript in labrid species, and the presence of duplicated paralogs in certain
model organisms supports the notion that lineage-specific gene duplications frequently occur in
teleosts. The data show that the vtg gene cluster is more conserved between acanthomorph
teleosts and tetrapods, than in ostariophysan teleosts such as the zebrafish. The differential
expression of the labrid vtg genes are further consistent with the notion that neofunctionalized Aatype vtgs are important determinants of the pelagic or benthic character of the eggs in
acanthomorph teleosts.
Conclusion: The vertebrate vtg gene cluster existed prior to the separation of Sarcopterygii from
Actinopterygii >450 million years ago, a period associated with the second round of whole genome
duplication. The presence of higher copy numbers in a more highly expressed subcluster is
particularly prevalent in teleosts. The differential expression and latent neofunctionalization of vtg
genes in acanthomorph teleosts is an adaptive feature associated with oocyte hydration and
spawning in the marine environment.

Background
A defining feature of the early development of non-eutherian vertebrates is a cleidoic egg endowed with variable
amounts of yolk. Until very recently, the major products
of the vitellogenin (vtg) genes that encode yolk proteins
have been considered to be simple precursors of the
energy reserve of vertebrate eggs, but the latest studies
have demonstrated several non-nutritional roles for Vtg
[1,2]. Similarly, the recent observation that remnants of
vtg genes exist in Eutheria, including humans, but have
sequentially been lost through co-evolution with casein
genes [3] elegantly demonstrated that the three known vtg
genes in birds represent a conserved gene complement. In
a previous study, Finn & Kristoffersen [4] proposed a
model for the evolution and neofunctionalization of vtg
genes in acanthomorph teleosts. We identified vtgC as an
ancestral gene, and argued that the dual vtgAa/vtgAb system, first noted by La Fleur et al. [5] was derived from a
single form, the A-type vtg. In this model, the separation
of the vtgC- and vtgA-type genes occurred following the
second round (R2) of whole genome duplication (WGD).
Subsequently vtgA duplicated and formed paragolous
vtgAa and vtgAb genes in acanthomorph teleosts. This phylogenetic model has been corroborated by other investigators [6]. Most recently however, Babin [7] has provided a
syntenic map of vertebrate vtg genes, which shows that the
three forms of vtg are encoded in a vtg gene cluster (VGC)
in non-eutherian vertebrates. A major goal of the present
study was to integrate the statistical, biochemical and
physical models of vtg gene evolution in vertebrates.
Through a series of studies, we and other laboratories have
shown that the pelagic nature of a marine teleost egg is an
evolved feature [4] that primarily results from the maturational influx of water due to differential degradation of
VtgAa-type yolk proteins (Yp), and the temporal insertion
of novel aquaporins (Aqp1b) in the microvillous portion
of the plasmalemma [8-10]. The neofunctionalization of
the vtgAa form in acanthomorph teleosts, has sensitized
the heavy chain domain (LvH-Aa) to catheptic proteolysis
that generates a large organic osmolyte pool of free amino
acids (FAA) in the ovulated egg [1,9,11-19]. In contrast
the LvH domains derived from vtgAb and vtgC genes may
be partially cleaved, but remain mostly intact following
the maturational proteolytic event, and thus contribute
minimally to oocyte hydration [1,12,14,17,18]. In teleosts that spawn benthic eggs (benthophils), a character
that we have argued to be the ancestral condition due to
an ancient freshwater heritage (Finn & Kristoffersen,
2007), Yps may be cleaved or partially processed to generate a small pool of FAA during oocyte hydration [6,2024].
In order to reconcile the differences in the phylogenetic,
biochemical and syntenic models we have examined the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/2

evolution and expression of the vtg gene complement in
modern (Perciformes: Labridae) and old (Clupeocephala:
Clupeidae) teleosts that spawn pelagic and benthic eggs.
We were interested in determining how the expression of
different vtg transcripts relates to the character of the egg
in a single family of closely related teleosts, and whether
lineage-specific gene duplication resulted in neofunctionalization of the Aa-type vtgs. To determine the orthologies
and ancestry of the novel labrid vtg genes cloned in the
present study, we anchored the results of phylogenetic
inference with the syntenic arrangement of genomic vtgs
in model vertebrates. This approach allowed us to identify
the proto-chromosomal origin of the VGC that is conserved between the Actinopterygii (fish branch) and the
Sarcopterygii (tetrapod branch). It further allowed us to
conclude that neofunctionalization of the vtgAa genes in
acanthomorph teleosts occurred long after the duplication event.

Results and discussion
Multiple transcripts
A total of eleven vtg transcripts (six full-length and five
partials) were cloned from vitellogenic livers of the labrid
species investigated (Fig. 1). NCBI BLAST searches of the
deduced proteins verified that all sequences are members
of the Vtg family. Four distinct vtg cDNA sequences were
cloned from rock cook (Centrolabrus exoletus) and
goldsinny wrasse (Ctenolabrus rupestris), two of which
(cevtgAb1 and crvtgAb1) were entirely novel for vertebrates. Three transcripts (lmvtgAa, lmvtgAb2 and lmvtgC)
were obtained from cuckoo wrasse (Labrus mixtus).
Repeated attempts using gene-specific primers to extract a
second vtgAb-type transcript from livers of cuckoo wrasse
did not yield any novel transcripts. The deduced amino
acid sequences of the full-length rock cook and cuckoo
wrasse Vtgs revealed that the VtgAa and VtgAb products
are complete pentapartite type proteins (NH2-LvH-PvLvL-β'-CT-COO-) while VtgC belongs to the phosvitinless
class of Vtg (NH2-LvH-LvL-COO-) [25].

Since it is now postulated that the vertebrate vtg gene complement represents a conserved cluster in Sarcopterygii
(the tetrapod branch) and Actinopterygii (the fish branch)
[7], we aligned the longest partial segment of the labrid
sequences to the genomic variants in chicken (Gallus gallus) and medaka (Oryzias latipes), respectively (Fig. 2). Relative homology scores of the aligned amino acids and
codons revealed three forms with highest identity to
medaka olvtgAa1, olvtgAb and olvtgC, respectively (Fig. 3).
The relationship between the teleost and chicken genes
was less obvious, with essentially equal identity scores for
the ggvtgII and ggvtgIII products. Interestingly, GgvtgI had
slightly lower scores to the teleost C-type products compared to the Aa- or Ab-type products over the aligned LvH
sub-region (Fig. 2). This suggests that despite their orthol-

ogy (see below) the minor ggvtgI and vtgC genes have
functionally diverged in association with the loss of the
phosvitin (Pv) and C-terminal domains in teleosts.
Within the labrid species, sequences had highest identities
to their homologs in closely related goldsinny wrasse.
Since only a single Ab-type transcript was detected in
cuckoo wrasse, and it showed 100% identity to the novel
cevtgAb2 and crvtgAb2 sequences over the ~250 aligned aa
and ~750 aligned nt (Fig. 3), we named the cuckoo wrasse
Ab-type sequence lmvtgAb2.
To further classify the labrid vtgs, we conducted large-scale
phylogenetic analyses of the deduced amino acid and
codon alignments of available (genbank) and novel
genomic (ensembl) variants. For the genomic variants, we
identified three genes in 3-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus
aculeatus), torafugu (Takifugu rupribes) and spotted green
pufferfish (Tetraodon nigriviridis), respectively, and four
genes in medaka, of which two have been independently
sequenced (see Additional file 1). In zebrafish eight genes
are found in the genome, of which several have been fully
[26] or partially sequenced [27], and each of which is
expressed and deposited in the growing oocyte [28]. Validation of the tree topology was achieved through multiple
methods of phylogenetic inference. Each method consistently clustered the labrid sequences as three forms: vtgAa,
vtgAb and vtgC, respectively (Fig. 4). For Bayesian, maximum parsimony and neighbour-joining analyses the
majority of branches were supported by 100% posterior
probabilities, and 100% bootstrap values, respectively,
with only minor branch rearrangements within gene
groups. These data verify that three forms of vtg exist with
acanthomorph teleosts, two within protacanthomorph
teleosts [29], and three within ostariophysan teleosts. The

data further revealed that a fourth novel gene in medaka
is an Aa-type product, and we thus classified it as olvtgAa2.
In a separate study, we have identified three novel gene
variants in a basal clupeocephalan teleost, the Atlantic
herring (Kristoffersen et al. unpublished data). These
Atlantic herring transcripts clustered as a basal node to all
ostariophysan vtgs in full agreement with the clupeocephalan phylogenetic rank.
The present analyses thus fully corroborate our earlier
study of vertebrate vtgs [4] wherein the major and minor
transcripts cluster according to taxonomic group. We further verified the inferred duplication of the vtgAa and
vtgAb clusters using the method of Zmasek and Eddy [30].
Hence the tree topology is inconsistent with the syntenic
arrangement of vertebrate vtg genes, and suggests that different functions have evolved within the major clades.
Specifically for acanthomorph teleosts, the LvH-Aa
domains have evolved a sensitivity to acidic degradation
following activation of V-class proton pumps during
oocyte maturation [1,9,11-13,15,17,18]. The data for
labrid teleosts that spawn benthic and pelagic eggs support this view [[19,20], see below].
In order to understand the disparity between the phylogenetic and syntenic arrangement of vertebrate vtg genes, we
increased the phylogenetic data set to include all known
sarcopterygian vtgs (108 sequences, containing ~370 k
nt), including amphibian, bird, reptile and platypus variants. In addition we examined the syntenic positions of
vtg genes within non-metatherian vertebrates. The larger
data set did not affect the topology of the teleost branches,
but did place ggvtgI and the partial platypus transcript
(ENSOANT00000031211) at the base of the tetrapoda
and closer to, but on a separate branch to teleost vtgC var-

of
ENSOANT00000013101-ENSOANT00000013100)
clustered as a basal node to ggvtgIII and ggvtgII, but after
amphibian variants. These findings agree with the recent

studies of Brawand et al. [3] and Babin [7] who demonstrated that three genes exist in monotremata and are
putative orthologs of the three bird genes. Since these latter platypus genes are not yet localized to any chromosome, but are annotated in contigs 49.51 and 49.49,

respectively, it was not possible to discern their true
orthology, or syntenic arrangement in relation to chicken.
However, by combining the results of the present phylogenetic data with the syntenic positions of the chicken and
teleost vtgs, it can be stated that teleost vtgC genes are the
putative orthologs of ggvtgI, and that teleost vtgAa and
vtgAb genes are the putative orthologs of ggvtgII and ggvtgIII, respectively.
Previously we showed that the evolution of Vtg subdomains is neither clock-like, nor under strong functional
constraint [4]. We further highlighted the disparate retention of the sub-domain structures of the mature proteins.
Teleost VtgC proteins have all lost the highly phosphorylated polyserine Pv region and the C-terminal domains
that are homologous to human VWFD. In chicken, however, all three Vtgs, including GgvtgI, are complete type
proteins containing all encoded domains. The same
appears to be true for other tetrapod Vtgs, exemplified by
amphibia and the platypus, although Brawand et al. [3]
have shown that premature stop codons or indels have led
to loss of function in ggvtgII/III orthologs in the platypus.
The loss of sub-domains in teleosts is not restricted to the
VtgC class. Amongst all ostariophysan teleosts, which represent the second largest superorder of fishes [31-33], the
major gene expressed encodes a truncated form of Vtg that
lacks the Vwfd region [26,27,34-36]. However, a complete-type gene is present in zebrafish as vtg2, and a novel

juxtaposed gene (vtg8) encodes a protein that lacks the Pv
and CT domains, i.e. a tripartite protein (NH2-LvH-LvL-β'COOH). To address the vtg orthologies in Ostariophysi,
we thus included all known zebrafish coding variants in
the phylogenetic data set and examined their loci.
Unlike other acanthoperygian and sarcopterygian animals
for which genomic data are available, the chromosomal
loci of zebrafish vtgs are complex. Seven genes (vtg1, vtg2,
vtg4, vtg5, vtg6, vtg7 and vtg8, hereafter called ZfVTG1-8)
are located in a tight cluster on Dre22 (bp 23,098,595 –
23,301,096), while vtg3 is located on Dre11 (bp
26,086,024 – 26,105,006). However, none of the
upstream or downstream genes that flank the ggvtgII/III or
vtgAa/Ab clusters in sarcopterygians or teleosts, respectively, are currently annotated on Dre22. The ZfVTG1-8
cluster thus represents an island of vtg genes that has
either lost the flanking genes, or translocated from
another chromosome such as Dre11. Alternatively, the
chromosomal loci may reflect the remnants of WGD,
where differential loss via diploidization [37-39], or
germline fusion and fission events have only left traces of
the ancestral condition [40-42]. Indeed Kasahara et al.
[40] have argued that Tni1 in spotted green pufferfish,
which has retained the VGC, is derived from fusion of
proto-chromosomes f, g and m, while Ola4 in medaka,
which also has retained the VGC, is derived from protochromosome m. Interestingly medaka Ola17 which has

lost the VGC, but retained the flanking genes, and Ola20
which also is derived from proto-chromosome m, as are
Tni6 and Tni15 in spotted green pufferfish are the likely
genomic remnants of the lost VGC paralogons. In
zebrafish the derivatives of proto-chromosome m have
translocated to Dre6, 8, 11 and 22, and fission variants
have been retained in Dre2 and 24 [40]. Thus orthologs of
the genes that flank the VGC in chicken should be localized in these chromosomes. This happens to be the case
(Fig. 5). However, since none of the orthologs that flank
the chicken VGC are annotated on Dre22, deciphering the
orientation of the ZfVTG1-8 remains challenging. The

synovial sarcoma, X breakpoint 2 interacting protein
(Ssx2ip) that is juxtaposed to GgvtgII and OlvtgAa1, as in
all other vertebrates [7], is currently annotated in scaffold
Zv7_NA1811 in zebrafish. A BLAST search for this protein
revealed multiple hits throughout the genome. However,
one hit (e = 5.2 × 10-6) was found on Dre22 at position 7.4
Mb. We have therefore oriented the ZfVGC1-8 as shown
in Fig. 5, which also corresponds to the increasing bp
positions observed in other vertebrates.
To ascertain the local cis-duplication events, we integrated
the results of the phylogentic analyses. The topology of

the vertebrates. Arrows infer the likely direction of duplication or rearrangement. Labrid vtgs are shown on dashed lines since
no genomic data are currently available for linkage maps. The ZfVTG1-8 cluster is preliminary oriented according to increasing
bp loci and a BLAST hit for the Ssx2ip protein. The rearrangement of the genes to different chromosomes is consistent with
their origin in protochromosome m [see [40]]. Linear representations of the sub-domain structures of each type of Vtg are
shown for clarity.

the ZfVTG1-8 shown in Fig. 4 precisely replicates the chromosomal loci of each gene in the genome shown in Fig. 5.
This is also true for the meadaka VGC, where olvtgAa2 represents an internal duplication of the independently
sequenced olvtgAa1 (Q8UW88_ORYLA). In fact each of
the major genes that are expressed in vertebrates are
located at the outer edge of the ggvtgII/III and vtgAa/Ab
VGC. This arrangement appears to have implications for
the differential expression of the cluster, where cis-regulatory elements associated with estrogen induction [43,44]
and recruitment of the transcription initiation complexes
are concerned.
In zebrafish, vtg1 is the major gene, which can be
expressed at levels 100 – 1000× higher than other variants
[27]. Similarly, in other teleosts, expression ratios of the
Aa- or Ab-type vtgs vary according to species
[1,12,24,25,45-47]. This is also true for the major ggvtgII
gene in chicken [48]. Previously we have shown that in
goldsinny wrasse, extreme levels of Aa-type Yps are incorporated in the growing oocyte [19]. These Yps are substantially degraded to FAA during pre-ovulatory maturation,
leaving only a lipovitellin light chain (LvL-Aa) fragment
for embryonic development. Due to the neofunctionalization of VtgAa [4], the degree of Yp proteolysis may depend
upon the relative expression levels of each vtg, and it has
been predicted that a dynamic expression ratio of vtgAa
and vtgAb forms should exist in relation to ambient temperature and salinity, egg size and the presence of oil globules [25]. To investigate this possibility, we performed
Northern blots of hepatically expressed transcripts in the
three labrid species (Fig. 6).
The selected model of labrid teleosts are best known for
their cleaning behaviour, a character that is currently
being exploited as an environmentally-friendly means of
biological control of ectopic parasites in mariculture.
Members of this family, the third largest of vertebrates
[49] with more than 600 species in 82 genera [50] are also
known for their remarkable sex lives [51], where sex
change, transvestitism and male-dominated parental care
is prevalent. Although only one species spawns pelagic
eggs in the temperate coastal waters of our Norwegian
study area, it is noteworthy that all labrid teleosts are
marine species, with the vast majority spawning pelagic
eggs in a subtropical environment [52]. An understanding
of the differential expression in the non-disrupted vtggene complement in this family of fishes is an important
step towards development of sex-specific molecular markers for this group.
Probes were designed from the highly conserved N-terminal area of each cDNA sequence and their gene specificity
verified by subsequent cloning and sequencing. With the
exception of crvtgAb2, a single band of relevant size was

detected after hybridization in each species. Although several levels of regulation lie between an expressed hepatic
transcript and deposited Yp product in the growing
oocyte, it is noteworthy that vtg band intensities were
highly correlated to the type of Yp deposited in the
oocytes and the pelagic or benthic nature of the spawned
egg. For the goldsinny wrasse, which spawns pelagic eggs
and generates the largest pool of FAA during oocyte hydration, an exceptional level of vtgAa is expressed in the liver
compared to the other vtg transcripts. These data strongly
support our earlier findings where virtually all of the
oocyte Yps are maturationally proteolysed to FAA that

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:2

subsequently drive the osmotic flow of water into the
highly hydrated egg [19]. In the benthophil rock cook,
more even band intensities of the four vtg transcripts are
found, although higher levels of vtgAa are also expressed
in this species. The rock cook is a close relative of the corkwing wrasse (Crenilabrus melops), which generates a small
pool of FAA from partial Yp proteolysis during oocyte
hydration [20]. We have recently conducted a proteomic
analysis of the oocyte and egg Yps in the rock cook and
cuckoo wrasse and found that moderate oocyte hydration
is associated with proteolysis of mainly vtgAa derived Yp
products (Kolarevic unpublished data). In cuckoo wrasse,
a species that spawns benthic eggs and shows very limited
maturational proteolysis, higher levels of VtgAb-type Yps
are deposited in the oocyte. These latter observations are
further supported by the fact that although greater
amounts of RNA were inadvertently loaded in the vtgAa
lane, the vtgAb2 band had the highest intensity. The significance of higher expression levels of Ab-type vtgs relates to
the fact that these genes have not neofunctionalized [4]
and their Yp products remain mostly intact in the
hydrated egg as the major protein reserve for the developing embryo. Taken together, these data are in line with the
notion that differential expression of non-neofunctionalized and neofunctionalized vtgs in acanthomorph teleosts
is related to the benthic or pelagic character of the
spawned egg.

Conclusion
We find that labrid teleosts differentially express up to
four vtg genes that are orthologous to an ancient vtg gene
cluster that existed prior to the separation of Actinopterygii from Sarcopterygii. With the exception of zebrafish, the
vertebrate vtg gene cluster remains linked on single chromosomes that arose in close association with the second
round of whole genome duplication (WGD) >450 million years ago. Our model for lineage-specific duplication
of the major vtg genes in teleosts shows that they comprise
a variable subcluster. The copy number of this variable
subcluster, which comprises the ggvtgIII/vtgAb and ggvtgII/
vtgAa orthologs, is likely to be the combined result of the
third round of WGD in teleosts with subsequent gene loss
due to chromosomal rearrangements followed by lineagespecific gene duplications. The topology of the phylogenetic tree for the 8 zebrafish vtg genes precisely replicates
their chromosomal loci in the genome and suggests that
lineage-specific duplications can occur within the teleost
subcluster. The expression data for the labrid transcripts
demonstrated that the more ancestral vtgC genes that are
orthologous to chicken ggvtgI are the least expressed and
we argue that these minor genes have functionally
diverged in the teleost lineage due to loss of the Pv and Cterminal domains. In the closely related family of labrid
teleosts, the expression ratios of the major vtgAb and neofunctionalized vtgAa transcripts reflect the benthic or
pelagic character of the spawned egg.

Methods
Samples
Mature female cuckoo wrasse (Labrus mixtus), rock cook
(Crenilabrus exoletus) and goldsinny wrasse (Ctenolabrus
rupestris) were collected using traps and gill nets in the costal waters near Bergen, Norway. Fish were transported live
to the laboratory and maintained in fish tanks. Later they
where euthanized in accordance with the International
Guiding Principles for Biomedical Research Involving
Animals as promulgated by the Society for the Study of
Reproduction. Subsequent sampling of livers and ovaries
was performed in a cold room (4°C). Pre-hydrated
oocytes (PH ooc) and ovulated eggs (OV egg) were dissected from the ovaries and processed as described previously [19].
cDNA cloning
Total RNA was isolated from vitellogenic livers of three
rock cook females using RNAeasy kit (Qiagen). Extracts
were subsequently mixed together for single strand 3' and
5'-cDNA synthesis using Smart Race cDNA Amplification
kit (Clonetech, http://www.clonetech.com). The alignment of Finn & Kristoffersen [4] was used to select areas
that were specific to each form of vtg. Gene specific primers (GSP) (see Additional file 2) subsequently designed
from nt sequences of red seabream vtgAa, vtgAb and vtgC
(primers P1, P11 and P21) were then used to run 3' and
5'-RACE polymerase chain reactions (PCR) as recommended by the manufacturer.

A PCR product of approximately 4000 bp was amplified
using sense primer P1. It was cloned and sequenced as
described previously [19]. Three sense primers (P2–P4)
designed from a partial rock cook sequence were used in
addition to M13 vector primers to obtain the sequence of
the cloned product. In order to sequence the remaining Nterminal area of this gene, a new antisense GSP (P5) was
constructed from the aforementioned sequence. The
RACE PCR product (~1300 bp) was cloned and bi-directionally sequenced.
An antisense GSP for red seabream vtgAb (P11) was used
in a 5'-RACE PCR together with single stranded rock cook
5'-cDNA giving ~800 bp long PCR product. After cloning
and sequencing, two different ESTs were identified to
match the N-terminal end of vtgAb in other teleost species
using BLAST. To verify that the ESTs represent two novel
products, the same experiment was conducted with new
total RNAs that were extracted from two females and independently used for single strand cDNA synthesis. PCR
products from both reactions were gel-purified, cloned
and sequenced giving the same two distinct vtgAb
sequences. Full sequence of vtgAb1 was achieved by
primer walking with five sense rock cook GSPs (P12–
P16). An additional sense GSP (P17) was used to obtain
the remaining part of the partial vtgAb2 sequence.

Cloning of vtgC was accomplished using an antisense GSP
made from red seabream nt sequence (P21) and a sense
primer (P22) designed from rock cook ESTs. A PCR product of approximately 3500 bp was amplified using the latter primer and was sequenced with M13 vector primers
and three additional sense primers (P23–P25).
The same extraction procedures and sequencing strategies
were employed to retrieve full-length sequences of three
different vtg forms in cuckoo wrasse. Cloning of PCR
products amplified with the same red seabream GSPs (P1,
P11 and P21) as for rock cook, gave partial sequences that
were used to construct new vtgAa (P6–P10), vtgAb (P18–
P20) and vtgC (P26–P29) primers. Subsequent PCR reactions, cloning and sequencing of new PCR products were
done as described above. Despite using GSPs for both
vtgAb types in rock cook wrasse (P12 and P13), only a single vtgAb2 transcript was obtained.
Northern blots
Total RNA was extracted from each of the labrid teleost
livers, as described above, and electrophoretically fractioned in 1% agarose gels containing formaldehyde
(6.7%), stained with ethidium bromide solution to visualize rRNAs and blotted onto a Hybond-N nylon membrane (Amersham) by capillary transfer in 10 × SSC and
covalently linked to the membrane by exposure to the UV
light. Membranes were prehybridized in hybridization
buffer (PerfectHyb™ Plus, Sigma) at 68°C for 60 min
before being hybridized with denatured and labeled 32PcDNA probes (Strip-EZ DNA, Ambion) overnight as
described previously [53].

Four vtg gene specific probes for rock cook and three for
cuckoo and goldsinny wrasse ranging is size from 602 to
736 nt were constructed from the N-terminal regions. To
verify probe specificity, each was sequenced following
amplification, gel purification, and excision. Blots were
rinsed two times with 2 × SSC/0.1% SDS for 5 min and
once with 1 × SSC/0.1% SDS for 15 min at the room temperature. Additional washing was done with 0.1 × SSC/
0.1% SDS twice for 10 min at 68°C. In order to detect the
signals, membranes were exposed to Kodak's BioMax MS
film for 2 hr.
Phylogenetic analyses
Multiple sequence alignments of the deduced amino acids
were used to generate codon alignments of the sequenced
transcripts as described previously [4]. In order to determine gene orthologies, vtg genes from each of the currently sequenced teleost genomes were accessed from the
ensembl servers (zebrafish, medaka, 3-spined stickleback,
torafugu and spotted green pufferfish: ensembl release 49,
May 2008). For zebrafish, 8 genes were identified using
the graphical view and contiguous alignments of transcripts, of which 2 are located in genbank (see Additional

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/2

file 1 for accession numbers). For medaka, Babin [7]
annoted 5 genes on chromosome 4, however, we only
found evidence of 4 vtg genes, 3 of which are located
between bp 9,868,166 – 9,974,743. A novel construct
(olvtgAa2)
was
assembled
from
transcripts:
ENSORLESTT00000013001,
ENSORLT00000007668,
ENSORLESTT00000012994, ENSORLESTT0000001296
7, ENSORLESTT00000012953 that encoded a protein of
1671 aa. Similarly, a novel construct for 3-spined stickleback (gavtgAb) was assembled from transcripts
ENSGACT00000012852 and ENSGACT00000012880
located between bp 12,491,853 – 12,515,240 in group
VIII. To provide greater statistical support, the novel
sequences from the labrid species were aligned with the
genomic variants and other vertebrate taxa for which vtg
sequences are known (see Additional file 1).
Phylogenetic reconstruction was performed using Bayesian (Mr Bayes 3.1.2: 4 × mcmc chains, 1,000,00 generations, sample frequency 100, burnin 3500; [54],
maximum parsimony and neighbour joining (PAUP
4.0b10: 1,000 bootstraps; [55]) analyses of the amino
acid and codon alignments, and maximum likelihood
analyses of the codon alignments as described by Finn &
Kristoffersen [4].
