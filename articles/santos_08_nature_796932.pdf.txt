Abstract
Background: An understanding of the evolution of global transcription regulators is essential for
comprehending the complex networks of cellular metabolism that have developed among related
organisms. The fur gene encodes one of those regulators – the ferric uptake regulator Fur – widely
distributed among bacteria and known to regulate different genes committed to varied metabolic
pathways. On the other hand, members of the Actinobacteria comprise an ecologically diverse
group of bacteria able to inhabit various natural environments, and for which relatively little is
currently understood concerning transcriptional regulation.
Results: BLAST analyses revealed the presence of more than one fur homologue in most members
of the Actinobacteria whose genomes have been fully sequenced. We propose a model to explain
the evolutionary history of fur within this well-known bacterial phylum: the postulated scenario
includes one duplication event from a primitive regulator, which probably had a broad range of cofactors and DNA-binding sites. This duplication predated the appearance of the last common
ancestor of the Actinobacteria, while six other duplications occurred later within specific groups
of organisms, particularly in two genera: Frankia and Streptomyces. The resulting paralogues
maintained main biochemical properties, but became specialised for regulating specific functions,
coordinating different metal ions and binding to unique DNA sequences. The presence of syntenic
regions surrounding the different fur orthologues supports the proposed model, as do the
evolutionary distances and topology of phylogenetic trees built using both Neighbor-Joining and
Maximum-Likelihood methods.
Conclusion: The proposed fur evolutionary model, which includes one general duplication and
two in-genus duplications followed by divergence and specialization, explains the presence and
diversity of fur genes within the Actinobacteria. Although a few rare horizontal gene transfer events

have been reported, the model is consistent with the view of gene duplication as a main force of
microbial genomes evolution. The parallel study of Fur phylogeny across diverse organisms offers
a solid base to guide functional studies and allows the comparison between response mechanisms
in relation with the surrounding environment. The survey of regulators among related genomes
provides a relevant tool for understanding the evolution of one of the first lines of cellular
adaptability, control of DNA transcription.

Background
Fur proteins form a ubiquitous family of metal-responsive
transcription factors known to regulate the transcription
of several different genes in many diverse bacterial lineages. Upon binding to a metal ion, a conformational
change is induced in the Fur regulator that promotes interaction with a cognate DNA sequence, typically known as
a Fur or iron box [1]. Initially, Fe (II) was thought to be the
only metal able to play this role. In fact, Fur was initially
characterised as being an iron-responsive regulator of ferric iron uptake systems in Escherichia coli [2,3], hence its
name. However, several studies have shown that Fur can
bind other metals – besides iron – as co-factors, and thus
the range of known regulated genes became broader than
what was initially thought. Fur will bind Fe (II) and regulate iron homeostasis in several organisms [2,4-8]. However, in addition to iron, different Fur homologues
specifically require other divalent metals, including Zn2+,
Ni2+, Mn2+ or Co2+, in order to bind to their cognate promoter targets [9-11]. These transition metal ions are considered fundamental for bacterial growth, given that they
perform various essential functions in cellular metabolism. However, most of them are toxic at elevated levels.
Therefore, a strict balance between their uptake and efflux,
effected by metalloregulators like Fur, is essential for
homeostasis [12-15]. Excess amounts of these metal ions
elicit a number of stress conditions inside the cells, particularly oxidative stress [16]. Accordingly, some Fur-like
proteins, through sensing the availability of their specific
metal co-factor, are sensitive to the redox status of the cell,
establishing a relationship between these regulators and
the oxidative stress response [17-20].
Recent publications support a major role for Fur in the
regulation of various environmental conditions including
acid shock response, detoxification of oxygen radicals,
production of toxins and virulence factors, and several
other metabolic functions ([1] and references therein).
Particularly during pathogenic infections, iron and possibly other metals become generally unavailable. Therefore,
bacterial metalloregulatory proteins including Fur are
often crucial in pathogenesis processes. These observations have led to a growing recognition of the importance
of Fur as a global transcriptional factor.

Among the Fur-like proteins, those responding to oxidative stress by regulating a downstream catalase-peroxidase
have been the most studied in the Actinobacteria [19,2124]. However, despite detailed knowledge on catalaseperoxidase regulation and the variety of functional and
structural studies on numerous microorganisms, very little is known about the origin and molecular evolution of
fur. The increasingly recognised importance of Fur as a virulence factor [24-26] and as a potential target for novel
antibiotics [10,25] would be better addressed with a
deeper knowledge on its evolutionary history. The enormous diversity of Fur in terms of both required co-factors
and regulated genes has led to several efforts to organise
the family [9,27].
The phylum Actinobacteria is comprised of Gram-positive
bacteria with an overall high Mol% G+C content. The primary habitat for many of these bacteria is the soil, where
they degrade organic compounds and play an important
role in mineralisation. The lineage also contains important secondary metabolite-producers and several important pathogens and symbionts. The latter groups include
the mycobacterial agents of tuberculosis and leprosy and
the nitrogen-fixing plant microsymbionts Frankia spp.,
among other ecologically and economically important
microorganisms [28]. Actinobacteria also inhabit aquatic
systems, while others are associated with extreme environments such as acidic thermal springs [29], Antarctic regolith [30] or gamma [31] and UV irradiated biotopes [32].
The ability to inhabit these different environments probably selects for the capacity to sense and cope with a wide
range of metals, for which regulators of the Fur family are
important. It is this diversity of habitats and lifestyles that
makes Actinobacteria such an excellent subject for an evolutionary study of a global regulator like Fur.
The diversity of genes encoding regulators in a genome
defines an organism's ability to adjust to the surrounding
environment. Therefore, towards a parallel vision of the
different organisms and their conserved response mechanisms, we have undertaken a phylogenetic approach to
the Fur family using Actinobacteria as the model clade,
intending to extend and complement previous functional
and structural studies in an evolutionary perspective. We
have analysed the factors that shaped Fur regulatory functions in different bacteria in order to create a bridge

between origin and cellular role. An hypothesis that clarifies the presence and diversity of the Fur homologues in
Actinobacteria is presented, leading to a stable protein
family division based on functionality and phylogeny.
Furthermore, a relationship is established between each
organism's ecological niche, genome size, and number of
Fur homologues.

Results and Discussion
Overview of Fur homologues
To describe the phylogenetic history of the Fur regulators,
and knowing by previous reports that organisms may
have more than one Fur, only completely sequenced
actinobacterial genomes present in the NCBI (National
Centre for Biotechnology Information) database (March/
2007) were used. Since regulatory proteins are small and
not highly conserved, the Fur homologues included in
this study were chosen based not only on sequence similarity/identity values, but also on the presence of specific
residues necessary for the in vivo regulatory activity of Fur.
Functional studies on Streptomyces reticuli FurS have
shown the importance of five key residues: C96 and C99
are involved in reversible S-S bond formation, Y59 is
required for DNA binding and C96, H92 and H93 are
implicated in zinc coordination [20]. These residues were
conserved not only in the closely related mycobacterial
FurA, but also in the more distantly related Escherichia coli
Fur, making them good indicators to validate the occurrence of a Fur homologue.

An initial BlastP screening against each of the 36 actinobacterial genomes yielded 82 putative homologues. These
sequences were aligned with S. reticuli FurS to check for
the presence of the above mentioned key residues [see
Additional File 1]. Two putative homologues were eliminated at this stage, the Mjls_1895 from Mycobacterium sp.
JLS, that lacks all the key residues, and the Rxyl_1224 from
Rubrobacter xylanophilus DSM 9941, that lacks one of the
histidines. Conversely, Lxx02790, from Leifsonia xyli
subsp. xyli str. CTCB07, has an H instead of the Y59. Since
histidines and tyrosines are both polar and have similar
properties, this homologue was nevertheless retained.
Also retained were a number of homologues that presented the two histidines corresponding to H92 and H93
in the form HXH. The remaining 80 sequences were distributed as listed in Table 1: five genomes had four Fur
homologues, ten genomes had three, eleven genomes had
two, eight genomes had one, and finally two genomes did
not present any Fur homologue.
fur genes as part of a paralogous gene family
Since multiple fur homologues are present in many
genomes, it seems logical that duplication and divergence
from a common ancestor gene have occurred during their
evolution. To test this hypothesis and to analyse the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/185

degree of similarity and identity among the different
homologues, a multiple alignment was done using ClustalX [see Additional File 2] and a phylogenetic tree was
computed using the Neighbor-Joining (NJ) method (Fig.
1). The distribution of the evolutionary distances and the
tree topology strongly suggest that a duplication event
took place before the divergence of the actinobacterial lineages, implying that two paralogues were already present
in the last common ancestor. Duplication of fur after
divergence would have yielded a tree more closely resembling the 16S tree (Fig. 2A). However, this pattern was not
observed. Instead, homologues within each genome are
almost always separated by a node close to the root, while
orthologues from different organisms cluster together,
with strong bootstrap support.
Modelling fur evolution
We propose a duplication-based model to explain the
evolutionary history that took place leading to the various
fur genes in the Actinobacteria (Fig. 2B). According to this
scenario, the ancestral organism possessed a regulator that
had affinity for several metals and that could bind to various DNA sequences. This ancestral fur gene underwent a
paralogous duplication event, giving rise to homologues
designated as A and B in the Figs. 1 and 2. After the lineage
leading to Frankia diverged, the initial fur gene underwent
a second paralogous duplication event in this specific lineage, giving rise to the C homologue. Finally, in the progenitor of Streptomyces, the A homologue underwent a
third paralogous duplication leading to the D homologue. The E homologues (Fig. 1), which are only present
in seven copies, apparently had a different origin and will
be discussed below.

These duplication events were followed by specific losses
and further duplications that likely modulated the
response capacity of each organism to the particular set of
evolutionary pressures that characterise its ecological
niche. Based on the model described above, one would
expect to find one homologue of each kind in each taxon.
While the B homologue was generally conserved – there
are only two losses recognizable in R. xylanophylus and in
Tropheryma spp. – the A homologue was the object of several duplications and losses. This pattern suggests that the
selective pressures acting on this homologue were more
variable than the ones affecting the B homologue. Seven
organisms have two A homologues and one organism has
three A homologues (Table 1). Based on the principle of
parsimony, and looking at the 16S tree (Fig. 2A), one can
postulate four gains to explain these nine additional A
homologues (Fig. 2): one in the common ancestor of M.
smegmatis, Mycobacterium JLS, Mycobacterium KMS, Mycobacterium MCS and M. vanbaaleni; one in the common
ancestor of N. farcinica and Rhodococcus RHA1; one M.
smegmatis and another in Nocardioides. Given the synteny

duplication events are the most parsimonious explanation. This issue will be further discussed below. On the
other hand, thirteen organisms do not retain the A homologue, which can be explained by eight independent gene
losses (Fig. 2): one in the common ancestor of B. adolescentis and B. longum; one in the common ancestor of C.

Taking the two major groups originating from the first
duplication, one can speculate why A homologues are
subjected to such strong and diverse selective forces when
compared to the more conserved B homologues. As mentioned previously in the introduction, A homologues have
been extensively studied in several Actinobacteria, and at
least in Mycobacterium and Streptomyces spp. they control
the transcription of a downstream catalase-peroxidase,
having therefore a major role in the oxidative stress
response. Given that this kind of stress is inherent to all
oxygen-consuming organisms and able to affect many
molecules inside a living cell, it is not surprising to find

that anti-oxidant mechanisms and their regulators are
quite sensitive to evolutionary pressures related to each
specific ecological niche. Since orthologues most likely
retain their function across different species, it is reasonable to argue that the A homologues are involved in oxidative stress response regulation. On the other hand, B
homologues may either be involved in regulating a cellular function more conserved across organisms, or its
involvement in cellular metabolism is not as broad as in a
situation of oxidative stress, and therefore these homologues are more stable across organisms throughout geological time.
The E group of sequences likely originated from three
HGT (horizontal gene transfer) events: one to the Streptomyces ancestor (originating SCO4180 and SAV_4029),
and then from that to the Frankia – Acidothermus common
ancestor (originating Acel_0061, Franean1_6149,
Francci3_2661 and FRAAL2798) and to Nocardioides
(originating Noca_4251) in two separate horizontal transfers. These transfers would include the fur and the surrounding genes which, in parallel with the fur-katG case,
could be putatively regulated by Fur constituting an
operon. In the common ancestor of Frankia CcI3 and
ACN14a, a reshuffling of the genome could be responsible for disrupting of the genomic context, which is maintained among Noca_4251, Acel_0061, Franean1_6149,
SCO4180 and SAV4029 (Fig. 3). This hypothesis can
explain both the presence and the synteny encountered
among these genes, and is supported by their %GC values
– FRAAL2798, Francci3_2661, SAV4029 and SCO4180
have a %GC value that deviates from the genome (Table
1). Lastly, with the exception of A. cellulolyticus, all these
organisms inhabit soil ecological niches which facilitates
the occurrence of HGT.
Finally, the R. xylanophilus homologues are the only ones
that are not considered in our model – they seem to have
been acquired independently from other Actinobacteria
by three individual HGTs. In fact, their %GC values are
different both among the sequences and comparing with
the genome. A single HGT followed by duplication is also
an hypothesis to be considered, especially since it is
known that laterally transferred genes have higher rates of
duplication [33].
In order to validate the NJ results and to evaluate the
strength of the proposed model, a Maximum-Likelihood
(ML) tree was computed [see Additional File 3]. The outcome of it corroborates the NJ phylogeny. Despite the fact
that the ML tree is not completely resolved, having 14.8%
unresolved quartets, it is clear that the groups identified
by NJ are maintained, as well as the relations between
them. In fact, the C group of homologues emerges from a
node close to the root, while the D group of homologues

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/185

is related to the A group, which suggests that C had its origin by duplication of the ancestor gene while D had its
origin on a duplication of the A.
From Actinobacteria to the big picture
One interesting question regarding evolution of Fur in
Actinobacteria is whether the first duplication occurred in
the ancestor of the Actinobacteria, or if it was an earlier
event that would have appeared in other lineages. To
address this question, we randomly selected three different species from each Eubacteria group (except in cases
like Acidobacteria where fewer than three genomes are
available) and investigated the presence of Fur homologues combining a relaxed BlastP screening against each
genome individually with annotation information. The
resulting sequences were aligned with the Fur homologues from the Actinobacteria [see Additional File 4] and
a NJ tree was computed [see Additional File 5]. The first
bifurcation of this tree divides it into two major groups:
one of them contains the actinobacterial A homologues
and the other contains the actinobacterial B homologues,
indicating that the initial duplication occurred in the
eubacterial common ancestor. This tree also supports a
common origin for the E group of homologues, which are
clustered together and separated from the other actinobacterial groups. Multiple origins for this group, either by
HGT or duplication, would result in the distribution of
these homologues all through the tree. Their clustering
shows that either they resulted from a common duplication that was lost in all the other Actinobacteria, or, more
parsimoniously, that they resulted from the described
HGT. The R. xylanophylus homologues appeared later,
which results in a scattered distribution in the tree, supporting an origin in independent HGT events.

Interestingly, previously published work concerning the
evolutionary history of Fur and other iron and manganese-responsive transcriptional regulators in alphaproteobacteria [34] indicates that most of bacteria in this lineage
have only one Fur, involved in iron homeostasis regulation, which evolved towards a manganese-homeostasis
regulator (Mur) in Rhizobiales and Rhodobacteraceae.
However, and in the same study, another regulator
present in some of the alphaproteobacteria and named Irr
was characterised and considered to be part of the Fur
superfamily. Putative Irr-binding sites have been found
upstream of genes encoding iron-homeostasis and ironcontaining proteins, in particular catalase-peroxidases,
suggesting that this regulator might functionally correspond to the actinobacterial oxidative stress-related Fur.
Although Rodionov et. al (2006) have studied the Fur/
Mur phylogeny separately from the Irr one, the fact that
they are placed in the same superfamily suggests a common origin, thus supporting the hypothesis that the first
Fur duplication occurred in the eubacterial common

ancestor, from which a group related with oxidative stress
response has emerged.

differences than those generated from recent duplication
events.

Duplicate to evolve
The proposed evolutionary scenario for fur is consistent
with the current view of gene duplication as a major
means of microbial genome evolution [35]. It has been
suggested that broadly functional genes are more easily
duplicated than functionally established ones, and that
the modifications that follow the duplications should
provide the appearance of new functional specificities. In
fact, although paralogues and orthologues have the same
general function, paralogues usually differ in specific biochemical details such as the primary target or a required
co-factor [36]. Thus, it is reasonable to conceive that an
ancestral fur gene, encoding a Fur protein with a broad
range of DNA-binding motifs and ionic co-factors,
through duplication and divergence, gave rise to the modern fur genes, now optimised and specialised.

Genomic context
In support of the proposed evolutionary model, it can be
observed that several fur orthologues are located in equivalent regions of their genomes (Fig. 3). Syntenic genes
reveal the core chromosomal segments present in a common ancestor, encoding a high proportion of essential
gene functions and presenting a significantly lower HGT
rate [37]. These syntenic regions are evidence for a group
with a common origin, and were considered significant
whenever at least two genes remained contiguous across
different chromosomes [37]. The high degree of synteny
observed for the fur orthologues points toward an early
origin. The identification of the regulators that were lost
or gained in each specific case may provide clues concerning the metabolic properties and pathways that are common to the lineage and those which specificity is more
species-related.

Consistent with the described model are the results of
independent biochemical characterization of three of the
S. coelicolor homologues: one of them (SCO0561 – group
A) is able to bind in vitro several divalent metals (Ni2+,
Mn2+, Zn2+ and Fe2+) and regulates the downstream catalase-peroxidase in a redox-dependent manner [22]; a second (SCO4180 – group E) binds specifically Ni2+ and
regulates the transcription of a FeSOD and a cluster of
genes related to nickel-uptake [9]; and the third
(SCO5206 – group D) binds metals yet to be identified,
responds to the redox changes of the cell and regulates a
monofunctional catalase [18]. In the same way, the biochemical characterisation of the Fur homologues in M.
tuberculosis have shown that the A homologue (Rv1909c)
regulates the downstream catalase-peroxidase in the presence of metals and in a redox-dependent manner [21,24],
while the B homologue (Rv2359) binds Zn2+ and is likely
involved in the regulation of genes responsible for zincuptake [10]. Thus, the main function – transcription regulation – is maintained among paralogues and orthologues. However, functional specificities such as the metal
coordinated and the genes regulated are only maintained
within orthologues (SCO0561 and Rv1909c), and diverge
in the paralogues of the same organism (SCO0561/
SCO4180/SCO5206 and Rv1909c/Rv2359). As might be
expected, paralogues resulting from recent duplications
are more similar than more ancient ones. In fact,
SCO5206, which according to the present model is predicted to be the result of a duplication of the A homologue, is functionally closer to its correspondent A
paralogue (SCO0561) than to the others. Although they
regulate different genes, both are functionally related to
oxidative stress response and dependent on the redox status of the cell. Paralogues from older duplication events
have had more time to evolve and have accumulated more

Correlation between genome size, ecological niche and Fur
homologues
Assuming that genome size is somehow related to the
selective pressures acting upon an organism, and that Fur
is a global transcriptional regulator able to sense different
metals and to regulate the expression of different genes,
we argue that the larger the genome size and the underlying selective pressures, the higher is the need for Fur regulators and the lower the pressure toward gene loss. Indeed,
the number of Fur homologues tends to increase with
increasing genome size. As seen in Table 1, organisms
with genomes smaller than 2 Mbps have no Fur homologues, organisms with genomes between 2 and 5 Mbps
have 1 or 2 Fur homologues, while organisms with
genomes between 5 and 7 Mbps have 3 Fur homologues
and organisms with genomes between 7 and 9 Mbps have
4 Fur homologues, with seven exceptions:A. cellulolyticus,
M. avium 104, M. ulcerans, Nocardioides JS614, Rhodococcus
RHA1, R. xylanophilus and S. avermitilis. This relation finds
support in statistical analysis: the Pearson Product
Moment Correlation was calculated using genome size
and number of Furs as variables, and the result was 0.823,
statistically different from 0 with α = 0.05.

T. whipplei spp. is an interesting case. Adaptation to a
strictly host-adapted lifestyle has led to gene loss and several metabolic pathways, namely those related to amino
acid biosynthesis and energy production, have been lost
[38]. In this scenario, the need for regulators is reduced,
leading to the loss of Fur proteins. On the other hand, the
ecological niche occupied by each organism may explain
the seven exceptions noted above. A. cellulolyticus, Nocardioides JS614, and R. xylanophilus have one more Fur than
predicted by their chromosome size. While the first organ-

ism is a thermophile and the second one inhabits the soil,
the third organism exhibits high tolerance to radiation.
These considerable stressful situations may have imposed
selective pressures that maintained an extra fur homologue in the chromosome, despite its size. On the other
hand, M. avium 104 and M. ulcerans have one less homologue than predicted by their chromosome size. This may
be explained by the fact that these organisms are host
associated: it is known that host-associated bacteria tend
to undergo a genome reducing process. Finally, Rhodococcus RHA1 and S. avermitilis also have one less homologue
than predicted by their chromosome size. There is no
obvious explanation for these cases.
Frankiae, a group of plant microsymbionts able to fix
atmospheric nitrogen, illustrates what is stated above.
Recently, three Frankia strains have been sequenced,
ACN14a, EAN1pec and CcI3, and the presence of a high
number of transcriptional regulators has been noted [39].
Interestingly, these genomes present highly divergent
sizes: ACN14a has a genome of 7.5 Mbps, encoding 6711
proteins; EAN1pec has a genome of 9.0 Mbps, encoding
7976 proteins; and finally, CcI3 has a genome of 5.4
Mbps, encoding 4499 proteins. One possible explanation
proposed to account for the differences in genome size is
related to the variation in their lifestyles. While ACN14a
and EAN1pec survive well in the soil, CcI3 appears to be
undergoing a genome reducing process, becoming more
and more dependent on the plant symbiont and less able
to survive by itself [39]. The increased gene contents of
ACN14a and EAN1pec provide a variety of "extra" genes
that allow these strains to survive in a variety of soils and
in symbiosis. CcI3 is apparently losing its ability to survive in the free-living state so selective pressures are lower
and fewer regulators are needed. This is clearly in agreement with the number of Fur homologues that were identified for each strain:Frankia ACN14a and EAN1pec have
4 homologues each, while CcI3 has only 3.
Alternative hypotheses
As mentioned above, there are nine gains of the A homologue that cannot be explained by the proposed model.
Although four independent duplications appear as the
most parsimonious explanation for their origin, the
hypothesis of HGT should also be considered, especially
since six out of the nine homologues have a %G+C content different from the genome (MSMEG_6383,
Mjls_5253, Mkms_4974, Mmcs_3447, nfa3250 and
Noca_0874). The presence of synteny within at least one
of the groups of homologues (MSMEG_6253, Mjls_5253,
Mmcs_4885, Mkms_4974) favours the hypothesis of
duplication but it does not exclude HGT, since the transfer
of entire chromosomal fragments (instead of single
genes) is possible.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/185

On the other hand, one of the factors that limits HGT is
that the transferred genes must outcompete indigenous
ones, which are already part of a complex and adapted
network, in order to be fixed in the genomes [40,41]. One
expects essential regulatory genes to be stable during evolution. In fact, it is not simple for a regulator like fur to be
horizontally transferred, enter a complex network, and
establish itself as a major regulator. Furthermore, recent
work has suggested that HGTs seldom affects orthologues
[42]. Therefore, due to the number of the fur homologues
in the genomes, their synteny and their nature as global
regulators, explaining the presence of these genes by HGT
should be used with care, and consequently %G+C value
alone should not be the exclusive argument to sustain a
HGT situation.
Regarding the E sequences, the situation is inverted.
Besides %G+C values, other factors seem to favour HGT.
One could hypothesise three independent duplication
events as the origin of these genes: in the Streptomyces
ancestor, in the Frankia – Acidothermus common ancestor
and in Nocardioides. However, the presence of synteny
across these different groups – and not only within them,
as happens in the duplicated A homologues – indicates a
common origin for all of the genes that constitute them,
excluding the three independent duplications as well as
three independent HGTs. Another explanatory hypothesis
would include a single genomic duplication in the last
common ancestor of the organisms involved. However,
this last common ancestor is actually the last common
ancestor to most of all the other Actinobacteria considered, and so the possibility of duplication would imply a
high rate of gene loss. In fact, and in terms of number of
evolutionary steps, the 3 in-tandem described HGT is the
most parsimonious explanation for this group of genes.

Conclusion
The abundance of fur genes in Actinobacteria and their
phylogenetic relationship points towards early duplications in the evolution of these regulators, along with additional HGT and later intra-species duplications. A strong
synteny between fur orthologues regions is consistent
with the proposed model and supported by functional
studies. These observations provide clues for future studies concerning the importance of Fur in regulating other
systems besides oxidative stress in organisms inhabiting
diverse ecological niches and under dissimilar selective
pressures. Furthermore, they help to differentiate between
the basic essential processes and the species-specific ones.
Exploring the phylogeny of regulators at the same time as
their functionality and the organisms' ecology is a promising strategy to explore how different bacteria adapt to
their various habitats and lifestyles by a fine-tune control
of DNA transcription.

Methods
Blast searches and sequences retrieval
In order to identify all the fur homologues in the completely sequenced actinobacterial genomes present in
NCBI database (March/2007), a two-step approach was
used. Initially, BlastP analyses were performed against
each genome individually, using Frankia alni ACN14a
FRAAL3168 as the query sequence: only hits with an evalue below or equal to e-05 were retained for further
analyses. Afterwards, the retrieved sequences were aligned
with Streptomyces reticuli FurS (CAA74697), in order to
check for the presence of five key residues shown by D.
Ortiz de Orué Lucana et al. (2003) to be essential for Fur
functionality: cysteines 96 and 99, histidines 92 and 93
and tyrosine 59.
Multiple alignments and phylogenetic trees
Multiple alignments were performed using ClustalX 1.81
[43] with all the default parameters. The data set included
the Fur homologues' amino-acid sequences, with or without Archaeoglobus fulgidus DSM 4304 Fur (NP_071057) as
the outgroup, and 16S ribosomal RNA nucleotide
sequences [see Additional File 6] retrieved from each
genome page on NCBI. The resulting alignments were
used to generate phylogenetic trees by the Neighbor-Joining (NJ) method [44] using the same software, and by the
Maximum Likelihood (ML) method [45] using Tree-Puzzle 5.2 [46]. Bootstrap values were calculated for the NJ
trees using 10000 replicates to evaluate the robustness of
the nodes [47].

For the ML analysis, the evolution model used was the
WAG model [48], selected by Tree-Puzzle as being the one
that best described our data. The parameter estimation
was exact and used quartet sampling (for substitution
process) and NJ data (for rate variation). The chosen tree
search procedure was Quartet Puzzling and 50000 puzzling steps were computed in order to obtain the consensus tree.
Trees were visualised by NJPLOT [49] and PhyloDraw 0.8
[50].

Synteny analyses
For each fur homologue, the adjacent regions were visually inspected in order to detect the presence or absence of
synteny. The inferred amino acid sequences for the 4
genes found upstream and downstream of each fur were
used as query in a BlastP search against all the sequenced
actinobacterial genomes, and those with e-values below e05 were analysed to determine if any hit corresponded to
a gene-encoding protein occupying a similar position relative to a fur orthologue in another organism.
