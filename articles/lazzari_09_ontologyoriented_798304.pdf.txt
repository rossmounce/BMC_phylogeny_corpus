Abstract
Background: Two complete genome sequences are available for Vitis vinifera Pinot noir. Based on
the sequence and gene predictions produced by the IASMA, we performed an in silico detection of
putative microRNA genes and of their targets, and collected the most reliable microRNA
predictions in a web database. The application is available at http://www.itb.cnr.it/ptp/grapemirna/.
Description: The program FindMiRNA was used to detect putative microRNA genes in the grape
genome. A very high number of predictions was retrieved, calling for validation. Nine parameters
were calculated and, based on the grape microRNAs dataset available at miRBase, thresholds were
defined and applied to FindMiRNA predictions having targets in gene exons. In the resulting subset,
predictions were ranked according to precursor positions and sequence similarity, and to target
identity. To further validate FindMiRNA predictions, comparisons to the Arabidopsis genome, to
the grape Genoscope genome, and to the grape EST collection were performed. Results were
stored in a MySQL database and a web interface was prepared to query the database and retrieve
predictions of interest.
Conclusion: The GrapeMiRNA database encompasses 5,778 microRNA predictions spanning the
whole grape genome. Predictions are integrated with information that can be of use in selection
procedures. Tools added in the web interface also allow to inspect predictions according to gene
ontology classes and metabolic pathways of targets. The GrapeMiRNA database can be of help in
selecting candidate microRNA genes to be validated.

Background
In plants, microRNAs (miRNAs) act as key regulators of
several developmental pathways as well as of other molecular mechanisms, such as response to stress, or to environmental changes [1,2]. Plant miRNAs bind preferentially
RNA transcripts of transcription factors, usually inducing
their degradation. The events that lead to miRNA biogenesis are not completely elucidated, but critical steps are
known, such as transcription by RNA polymerase II (POLII) that produces primary miRNA transcripts (pri-miRs),
cleavage of the pri-miRs to produce precursors (pre-miRs),
and cleavage of precursors to obtain the miRNA:miRNA*
duplexes. The two cleavage steps in animals are performed
by the Drosha and Dicer enzymes. In plants no Drosha
homologue has been detected, while homologues to
Dicer were found in the nucleus as well as in the cytoplasm, suggesting that Dicer-like enzymes are involved in
both cleavage steps [3]. Pre-miR stem-loop structures can
be considered the hallmark of miRNAs and, because of
this, methods for in silico detection of microRNAs in plant
genomes are mainly based on their identification. Unfortunately, plant miRNA hairpins share their features with
other classes of non-coding RNAs, like siRNAs, as well as
with pseudo-hairpins that are present in the genome, particularly in repeat-rich regions. In animals, miRNA hairpins are shorter than in plants, being characterized by
quite long loops and short stems. This helps discriminating between miRNAs and other hairpin-forming non-coding RNAs. Plant miRNA hairpins have an extremely
variable length, spanning from about 60 to 500 bps, with
an average of 160 nucleotides, and contain short loops
and long stems. Furthermore, they do not exhibit preference with respect to the bulges position in the pre-miR
structure [4]. This situation complicates the task of distinguishing pre-miRs from the other hairpin-forming noncoding RNAs, and leads to a very high proportion of false
positives. Therefore, additional features distinctive of
miRNAs must be considered. Conservation of mature
miRNA sequences across species is a valuable source of
validation. Although plant hairpin sequences are known
to generally exhibit very low levels of sequence conservation (because the structure is usually more relevant than
the nucleotide sequence), mature miRNA sequences are
highly conserved even in phylogenetically distant species
[5]. Nonetheless, conservation across species does not
allow to identify species-specific miRNAs, thus, other features have also to be considered to discriminate among in
silico predictions.
In grape, a set of 140 miRNAs has been inferred by similarity to already known plant miRNAs, and positioned on
the Pinot noir genome sequence that was produced by the
Genoscope Consortium [6]. In this paper we present the
results of a de novo identification of miRNA genes and targets in the IASMA Pinot noir genome [7] that, with respect

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/82

to the Genoscope genome, presents a much greater level
of heterozygosity. Results from our analyses are stored in
the GrapeMiRNA web database.

Construction and content
MicroRNAs in silico detection and de novo predictions
selection
The second assembly of the high quality draft genome
sequence of a cultivated clone of Vvi Pinot Noir that was
produced at the IASMA [7] was used as reference
sequence. Gene positions on the genome, as well as
intron/exon boundaries and information concerning
repeats and other features were based on gene predictions
that were carried out at the IASMA. The FindMiRNA algorithm [8] was employed to scan the grape genome for the
presence of putative miRNA::target couples. FindMiRNA
identifies putative miRNA genes in intergenic regions,
with targets in gene sequences. In our analysis, putative
miRNA genes were searched on both strands in the intergenic regions, while putative miRNA targets were searched
within the gene sequences, encompassing 300 bp of both
upstream and downstream boundaries. Repeats, tRNAs
and low quality regions were masked prior to the analysis.

The FindMiRNA analysis produced 785,441 microRNA
predictions. These were parsed and used to populate a
MySQL database. As expected, the number of predictions
obtained with FindMiRNA greatly exceeded the expected
ratio of miRNAs in the grape genome, necessitating the
application of a selection procedure to reject the less reliable hits. A first filtering step was performed applying low
stringency filters to four parameters. We selected ≤ -28
kcal/mol as the lowest stability limit for the predicted
miRNA-target pair as estimated by FindMiRNA from the
minimum free energy (MFE) of the miRNA::target duplex,
and ≥ 45 bps as the limit for precursor length. Only miRNAs with percentages of G+C content between 33 and 65
were considered. Furthermore, based on the assumption
that plant miRNAs are likely to have an uracil residue at
the 5' end of their mature sequence [9], only the predictions having an uracil at the 5' end or in its boundaries
(bases -2, -1, 0, +1 and +2 with respect to the predicted
mature miRNA 5' end) were retained in the filtered database. The tolerance in uracil position was adopted to overcome the inability of FindMiRNA to precisely assign the
position of the miRNA 5' end. After this selection step, the
resulting subset contained 227,369 predictions (less than
30% of the total predictions), and was used to populate
the 'mirna' database table. Classification of predictions
with respect to the target position (in exons, introns, or in
5' or 3' UTRs) was performed, and predictions in the
mirna table were flagged accordingly. 5' or 3' position of
the predicted mature miRNAs on precursor sequences as
well as the precursor strand carrying the mature miRNA
were also inferred and added to the database. To further

investigate FindMiRNA predictions we proceeded with
two additional parallel analyses, the former based on
comparative genomics (see later), and the latter on distinctive sequence and structural features of the hairpins.
The experience of Kwang Loong and Mishra [10,11] in
identifying features crucial for miRNA distinction allowed
us to apply to our predictions five parameters having precise confidence intervals both in vertebrates and plants.
Among the precursor features of Kwang Loong and
Mishra, we selected length, G+C percentage, MFE of the
hairpin secondary structure normalized according to the
precursor length (MFEs), MFEs/G+C content percentage
(MFEI), and base-pairing propensity (P(S)): i.e. the percentage of nucleotides forming complementary base pairings within the hairpin structures. Considering that in
plants miRNAs mostly target gene exons, we focussed our
attention on the 54,143 predictions having targets in
exons (referred to as 'exon predictions', and stored in the
'mirna_exon' database table), and calculated values for
these parameters to be added to the database. Self containment scores were also calculated with the Selfcontain
algorithm [12]. The property of self containment can be
defined as the tendency for an RNA sequence to maintain

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/82

the same optimal secondary structure regardless of
whether it exists in isolation or is a substring of a longer
sequence of arbitrary nucleotide content. MiRNAs are
known to have very high self-containment scores (an average of 0.9, the score ranging from 0 to 1) when compared
to other functional RNAs.
To define grape-specific confidence intervals for all the
parameters calculated on FindMiRNA exon predictions,
we downloaded the complete Vvi miRNA dataset available at miRBase version 12.0 [13] (based on the Vvi Genoscope genome), to be used as the reference dataset for
thresholds setting. The 140 Vvi miRNAs were inspected
according to the seven parameters chosen for prediction
selection, and thresholds were set for each parameter as to
retain most of the miRBase miRNAs (Table 1). Applying
these cutoffs to FindMiRNA exon predictions, 5,778 predictions were selected (less than 13% of the total exon
predictions) and included in the 'selected predictions'
dataset. As miRNA detection was carried out on both
strands of the genome, FindMiRNA selected predictions
encompassed 2,500 and 3,278 miRNA genes on the grape
forward and reverse genome strands, respectively. In sev-

eral instances, the hairpin structure was present on both
strands in the same region, resulting in multiple predictions for the same genome position. Unfortunately, positions that refer to the same genome region in forward and
reverse orientation are not easily recognizable in FindMiRNA outputs, as reversed-complementary genomic
contigs are re-numbered in 5'-3' direction. As a consequence, it can be assumed that the overall number of
genome positions where predictions of miRNA genes
were recovered is less than 5,778.

point of view, the two analyses are not equivalent. BLAST
analysis highlights matches with not more than three
external mismatches on the full miRNA sequence, regardless of the presence of a hairpin in the region. PrecExtract
takes into account miRNA-like secondary structures but
with our low stringency settings allows up to four terminal
mismatches (two at each end). Merging the two analyses,
hits that fall in putative hairpins and having not more
than three terminal mismatches are retrieved. These miRNAs can be considered good candidates for validation.

Comparing predictions to the Arabidopsis and grape
Genoscope genomes
The PrecExtract program [8] allows to scan other genomes
with FindMiRNA predictions. PrecExtract doesn't take
into account putative miRNA::target pairings, but it
detects mature miRNA sequences proposed by FindMiRNA that fall in a genome region hosting a hairpin
structure that satisfies a maximum energy threshold and
has at least 70% of the mature miRNA and its complement binding. We used PrecExtract to compare the 5,778
selected predictions to the Arabidopsis thaliana (At) and to
the grape Genoscope genomes as downloaded from the
TAIR [14] and Genoscope [15] web sites, respectively.
Searching for full-length identities between predicted
miRNAs and the other genomes, only a limited number of
hits was retrieved. Conversely, when PrecExtract considered core sequences of predicted miRNAs where two bases
both at the 5' and 3' end were removed, a more consistent
number of hits was obtained (354 and 691 for At and
grape Genoscope, respectively), several with more than
one match with the compared genomes. The dramatically
higher number of hits retrieved using miRNA core
sequences can be explained considering that FindMiRNA
assigns with a low degree of precision the miRNA 5' end,
as clearly stated by FindMiRNA authors. Based on this, we
preferred to run PrecExtract on miRNA core sequences
rather than allowing mismatches all along the miRNA
sequence.

Comparing predicted precursors to grape EST sequences
In plants, pri-miRs are produced by POL-II and are capped
and polyadenylated [17]. Pri-miRs are processed and converted to pre-miRs, that are subsequently cleaved to generate miRNA:miRNA* duplexes. Being polyadenylated,
primary miRNA transcripts should be recoverable in EST
collections. Even if previous studies suggest that miRNAs
should constitute nearly 1% of predicted protein-coding
genes [18], their representation in EST datasets is usually
much lower, being under 0.01% [5].

In parallel to the PrecExtract analysis, comparison of predicted mature miRNAs to the At and Genoscope genomes
was also carried out with BLAST [16]. Only full-length
BLAST similarities with fewer than three mismatches in
the 5' and/or 3' ends and no gaps were taken into account,
and 218 and 173 hits were retrieved for the At and Genoscope genomes, respectively. MiRNAs retrieved both by
the PrecExtract and BLAST analyses were 81 for the At
genome and 106 for the Genoscope genome, and only 28
showed matches with both methods on both genomes
(IDs: 47802, 47806, 91434, 129414, 144854, 184639,
215697, 217048, 229160, 233378, 272542, 275873,

665068, 702837, 715369, 733207). From the biological

The current explanation is that the procedures that are carried out during EST libraries preparation contribute to
lower the amount of cloned miRNA precursors. Furthermore, the possible rapid processing of pri-miRs in the cell
may also contribute to the decreased representation of
their transcripts in cDNA libraries. Translation of pri-miRs
leads to short peptides that cannot be annotated against
conventional protein databases. Even considering the
over-mentioned problems, identification of miRNA precursors in ESTs is a tool which can improve knowledge of
miRNA biogenesis. In Arabidopsis, evidence of the presence of more than one miRNA within a single transcript
has been provided by Zhang et al [5], suggesting that also
in plants clustered miRNAs can be transcribed as polycistrons, as already observed in animals [19-22].
At the DFCI grape gene index (VvGI) [23], 78,976 unique
sequences that encompass 347,879 EST and 25,497 ET
sequences are available. This collection represents a comprehensive overview of the grape transcriptome, and it
thus merits scanning for the presence of miRNA precursors. We compared FindMiRNA putative selected precursors to the VvGI dataset by BLASTn, and recovered 152
ESTs perfectly matching 359 predicted precursors, reflecting both the redundancy that is intrinsic to the FindMiRNA output, as well as the possibility to recover the
same precursor in more than one genome position. We
annotated the matching ESTs and retrieved eight ESTs
without similarity to the NCBI nr protein database, suggesting that predictions that match these ESTs are good
candidates for validation (Table 2). Of the 32 precursors
matching the un-annotated ESTs, two were flagged as
miR-172, one as miR-159 and one as miR-397 (see later).

Predictions matching the VvGI un-annotated ESTs. VvGI identifiers are given in the leftmost column, together with the classification as singlet or
contig, as from the VvGI dataset. In the rightmost column, predictions matches to known miRNAs are displayed.

In most cases, more than one precursor matching the
same EST in almost fully overlapping regions was recovered, due most probably to the abundance of predictions
proposed by FindMiRNA. No transcripts containing more
than one miRNA or more copies of the same miRNA were
detected.
Predictions matching ESTs corresponding to known proteins need to be checked with caution. The consideration
of a sample subset, in fact, indicated that these predictions
are likely to reflect problems in gene assignments. For
instance, the 89 predictions ranked in Contig6 according
to precursor similarity should be discarded, because their
putative precursors are part of a gene sequence not recognized by gene predictors because the start of the contig lies
within the gene coding sequence. When compared to the
NCBI protein nr database, both the homologous EST and
the genomic region encompassing the putative precursors
showed a significant homology with the Populus tri-

chocarpa CCHC-type integrase: a zinc finger, retroviraltype protein. As multiple copies of this gene or its paralogs
can be retrieved in the genome, multiple putative targets
were spotted by FindMiRNA, and a high number of false
predictions were generated. Predictions matching to
annotated ESTs were not removed from the database, but
were flagged with the EST name.
Positioning of known miRNAs on the grape genome
Four BLAST analyses were carried out to compare FindMiRNA predictions to known miRNAs that are collected
in miRBase: mature miRBase sequences were blasted versus FindMiRNA mature sequences, target sequences, and
precursor sequences, and miRBase precursor sequences
were blasted versus the IASMA Pinot noir genome. Following this last comparison, positions of precursors on
the genome were retrieved and compared to positions of
precursors identified by FindMiRNA, and predictions having mature sequence boundaries internal to the miRBase

Page 5 of 13

BMC Plant Biology 2009, 9:82

precursor genomic position were flagged in the database.
Three out of the four BLAST analyses were performed
using the Vvi miRBase dataset, while BLAST versus FindMiRNA precursor sequences was carried out using the
whole miRBase mature sequence dataset, completed with
the new Arabidopsis miRNAs proposed by Rajagopalan et
al [9]. In spite of this, no significant matches to additional
miRNA families, apart from those present in the Vvi dataset, were retrieved. In all BLAST analyses only full length
homologies with no gaps and not more than three mismatches were retained. On the whole, 65 predictions
showing similarity with Vvi miRBase entries were
retrieved, encompassing 17 out the 28 miRNA families
that are represented in Vvi miRNAs (Table 3).
Comparison between FindMiRNA and miRBase precursors sharing an overlapping genome position revealed differences in sequence length. By a large majority, miRBase
sequences are longer. The difference is in part explained
considering that miRBase stem-loop sequences include
the pre-miR and some flanking sequence of the presumed
primary transcript, whereas FindMiRNA predictions
describe only the putative pre-miR sequences. In this case,
similarity in our predictions both at the precursor and at
the mature miRNA level were found. In other instances,
similarity was evident only at the precursor level. This was
the case when putative mature sequences different from
those collected in miRBase were proposed by FindMiRNA
in regions suitable to form more than one hairpin structure. A third situation corresponds to similarities encountered only across mature sequences. This could be
explained by the fact that two different genomes were considered, with the IASMA one having a much greater level
of heterozygosity, where differences in precursor
sequences can exist as alternative haplotypes.
Comparing all miRBase mature sequences to FindMiRNA
precursors with our thresholds (not more than three mismatches and no gaps with the full-length mature
sequence) matches to all the 28 represented miRNA families were originally retrieved, involving 121 predictions.
Hits to 12 families were discarded following our further
analysis, where only matches with positions not more
than three bps distant from the precursor 5' or 3' end were
retained (table 3). When the discarded dataset – encompassing predictions with hits to miRBase mature
sequences internal to the core of the precursor sequence –
was analyzed according to more stringent criteria, and
only full-length perfect matches were considered, matches
to three miRNA families (miR151, miR153 and miR170)
were lost, while matches to eight other families, apart
from those presented in Table 3, were still recovered. It is
worth noting that four of these families (miR132,
miR136, miR140 and miR157) are not included in miRBase for Vvi. A possible explanation for this situation is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/82

that the involved predictions fall in genomic regions that
are prone to form hairpin structures, and FindMiRNA
failed to recover the ones leading to the matching mature
sequences. Reasons for this failure could be for example
ascribed to missing corresponding target sequences.
To further investigate the prediction accuracy of FindMiRNA combined with the chosen selection parameters
and thresholds, covariance models from 46 known microRNA families were deduced from RFam 8.1 [24] and used
to search the grape genome for homologues to known
structural RNA families with the Infernal software package
(data not shown) [25]. Infernal results were compared to
FindMiRNA predictions according to the genome coordinates, but even if many of the similarities identified by
BLAST were confirmed, no additional significant hit was
retrieved.
Analysis of genes involved in microRNA biogenesis
In the grape IASMA genome, 56 genes showing homology
with Arabidopsis Dicer-like proteins (DCL1, DCL2, DCL3
and DCL4), Argonaute (AGO1, AGO2, AGO4, AGO6 and
AGO7), Hyponastic Leaves 1 (HYL1), Nuclear RNA
Polymerase D (NRPD1a and NRPD2a), RNA-dependent
RNA Polymerase (RDR2 and RDR6), Zwille (ZLL), and
PAZ domain-containing protein/piwi domain-containing
protein were identified by BLASTp (E-value < e-11) [3]. In
plants, messages for Argonaute and other biogenetic and
effector proteins (i.e. DCL1) are considered as conserved
miRNA targets, together with messages for a variety of
transcription and stress response factors [9]. The selected
predictions dataset was scanned for the presence of putative miRNAs targeting the 56 over-mentioned genes, and
five predictions were retrieved (IDs: 42291, 238196,
385559, 474626, and 761661), all targeting genes belonging to the Argonaute family, and none matching known
miRNAs. The 42291 and 761661 predictions refer to the
same putative miRNA, targeting two different Argonaute
genes carrying identical target sites. An Arabidopsis
homolog to this miRNA was retrieved both by PrecExtract
and by BLAST. An Arabidopsis homolog was identified by
PrecExtract also for prediction 385559, that in addition to
targeting the AGO1 gene also targets a second gene coding
for a Pentatricopeptide (PPR) repeat-containing protein.

In recent studies, Rajagopalan et al. [9] provided evidence
of the presence of a miRNA gene (miR838) overlapping
DCL1 intron 14. Thus, we decided to perform a FindMiRNA run to detect eventual putative miRNAs in the
introns of the 56 genes involved in miRNA biogenesis,
with targets in grape gene exons. The same thresholds that
were used to prepare the selected_predictions dataset were
applied to the FindMiRNA output, and 99 predictions –
giving rise to 17 precursors similarity groups – were
retrieved and stored in the selected_intron_predictions

Predictions matches to known miRNAs according to the four adopted procedures. Datasets used for BLAST comparisons are given in column
headers.

table. Among these, no prediction matching either the
new miRNAs described by Rajagopalan et al. or the miRBase dataset was recovered. Intron predictions are available at the GrapeMiRNA web site.
Predictions ranking
In order to investigate the prediction dataset with respect
to the distribution of miRNA genes in the genome and to
recognition of target genes, ranking of predictions was
necessary. Predictions were grouped according to target
identity, precursor position in the genome, and precursor
sequence similarity, and results were stored in the database. Ranking according to target identity allows identifying different miRNAs that bind identical targets, as well as
different grape genes that share common miRNA targets
and genes with multiple copies of the same target. Identical target ranking produced 864 groups encompassing
3,026 out of the total 5,778 predictions, the other 2,752
remaining ungrouped. Thus, the selected predictions
encompass 3,616 different putative targets (864 + 2,752).
The second procedure, that was carried out with an inhouse developed script, aimed at the identification of precursors with start positions within 3 bp in the genome.
780 groups encompassing 2,228 predictions were
obtained, while 3,550 precursors remained ungrouped.
This means that according to their position in the grape
genome, the selected predictions can be ranked in 4,330
groups (780 + 3,550). Predictions ranking according to
precursor similarity was performed with CAP3 (Parameters: -p 98 -o 25) [26]. This procedure identifies miRNAs
that are present in more than one genome position. Of
course, multiple predictions generated by FindMiRNA for
regions where more hairpin structures are putatively
present fall in the same precursor similarity group, but
should be considered alternative structures of the same
putative miRNA and not multiple independent miRNAs.
Ranking predictions according to precursor similarity
resulted in 857 groups encompassing 4,060 predictions
(2,233 of which also belonging to position groups): in
total, 2,575 similarity groups were obtained (857 groups
+ 1,718 ungrouped precursors). Combining results from
the three procedures, an exhaustive view of miRNA genes
and targets distribution across the genome was obtained.
It is worth noting that precursor predictions that fall in the
same genome region but on opposite strands cannot be
grouped with the position ranking tool, but fall into the
same precursor similarity group.

As an example, we report here the analysis of one of the
most numerous groups obtained by similarity ranking of
precursor sequences (precursor_Contig207). This similarity group contains 73 miRNA predictions targeting 32
genes, with 24 different putative targets (i.e. it encompasses targets from 24 target ranking groups). The overall
predictions are ranked in 16 precursor position groups.
Some of these groups have consecutive numbers, indicating that they fall in genomic regions where multiple consecutive hairpin structures are present, all passing the
selected parameter cutoffs, with very close start positions
but spanning a region wider than three base pairs. These
are proposed by FindMiRNA as possible miRNA genes. If
consecutive position groups are further ranked, and corresponding predictions on reversed genomic contigs are
also merged, seven groups are obtained, which can be
assumed to correspond to seven similar miRNA genes
present in different genomic regions. 25 out of the 32 target genes associated to precursor_Contig207 are annotated as putative non-LTR retroelement reverse
transcriptases, one as an ankyrin-repeat containing protein and one as DNA-directed RNA polymerase, while the
5 remaining genes do not have a significant annotation.
Due to the redundancy of predictions, target genes are targeted by one to seven putative miRNA genes, but they
mainly contain single targets, or two tandem targets separated by about 100 base pairs.
An example of identical target grouping is CL863. This
group includes 56 predictions referring to a couple of
genes (fgenesh.VV78X016421.10_1 and fgenesh. VV78X
210321.6_1), both annotated as receptor protein kinaselike proteins. The two genes bear the same target in similar
positions (from bp 3383 to 3401 for the former, and from
bp 3377 to 3395 for the latter) and are putatively targeted
by 28 miRNA genes that are interspersed all along the
genome. None of these miRNA genes seems to be
repeated in tandem, as only one genomic contig includes
two miRNA copies, and these are very distant one from
the other. All putative mature miRNAs are on the forward
strand of the respective gene, at the 5' end.
Structuring the GrapeMiRNA web database: the text
search interface
Considering the large amount of data stored in the
GrapeMiRNA database, a web interface was prepared to
provide free access to all information. Our intention was
Page 8 of 13
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Plant Biology 2009, 9:82

to produce a web site with tools and facilities to allow
users to retrieve information according to multiple criteria. With this aim, we focussed on two main aspects:
retrieval of predictions according to their features and
parameter values, and retrieval of predictions according to
biologically relevant features of the targeted genes. Even if
the GrapeMiRNA database contains all the predictions
that were produced by FindMiRNA, the online version is
limited to the 5,778 selected exon predictions that are
supposed to represent the most reliable subset of the total
FindMiRNA output (Table 4). At the GrapeMiRNA web
site a text search page is available where users can perform
queries on a number of fields. Queries can be restricted to
subsets of predictions (i.e. predictions with homologues
in the At or Genoscope genomes, or matching already
known Vvi miRBase miRNAs), or to selected ranking
groups. In query outputs a table is displayed including the
most relevant information for each prediction matching
the query terms. PrecExtract results are included in the
output, when present, as well as the number of matches
retrieved by BLAST in comparisons between FindMiRNA
mature miRNAs and the At and the Genoscope genomes.
Predictions matching EST sequences are flagged with the
name of the corresponding sequence, and matches to Vvi
miRNAs included in miRBase are also given. In the output
table, miRNA predictions matching the query terms are
displayed. It is worth noting that predictions having more
than one hit to other genomes by PrecExtract are proposed in multiple lines. Thus, the number of retrieved hits
can be larger than the number of corresponding predictions. In the output, links to other web pages are provided,
where particular aspects are deepened. For instance, clicking on the target gene name of each prediction leads to a
page where the FindMiRNA output is displayed, together
with the miRNA, miRNA* and precursor sequences, and
the hairpin secondary structure, produced on the fly by
RNAFold [27] (Figure 1). Conversely, a click on the links
that are given in the 'Position assembled precursors', 'Similarity assembled precursors' and 'Target ranking group'

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/82

columns leads to tables containing all the predictions
matching the selected ranking group. Furthermore, in the
'Similarity assembled precursors' pages, precursor
sequences are displayed in multifasta format, and CAP3
[26] (parameters: -p 96) is run on the fly on the similaritygrouped precursors to display alignment results.
A group of options included in the text search page allows
to select predictions according to the targeted gene features. In the 'text search' page, targeted genes can be
retrieved according to their annotation, or to their best
BLAST hit ID. Furthermore, the possibility to retrieve
grape targeted genes belonging to metabolic pathways of
interest is also implemented. Query outputs can be downloaded or directly visualized with ordinary spreadsheets.
At the text search page, an option is given to visualize the
predictions contained in the selected_intron_predictions
table (i.e. predictions in introns of genes involved in
miRNA biogenesis), or the table can be downloaded in
Excel-compliant format.
Statistics on ontologies distribution
With the aim to allow investigating predictions according
to the annotation, ontology class, or metabolic pathway
of targets, a procedure was set to relate grape genes to corresponding UniProt [28], Gene Ontology (GO) [29,30],
and KEGG pathways [31] identifiers (IDs).

The 33,514 genes predicted by the IASMA on the Pinot
noir genome were annotated by BLASTx (e-value cutoff: e10) versus a customized version of the UniProtKB database
[28], where entries from genome sequencing projects having non-descriptive annotations and entries lacking crossreferences to GO IDs were discarded. 26,962 significant
hits were retrieved, representing the 80.45% of the total
gene predictions. Based on GO IDs that are associated to
UniProt IDs, significant best BLAST hits can be used to
classify grape genes in ontology classes.

The GrapeMiRNA web interface
The GrapeMiRNA web interface. An example of output display at the GrapeMiRNA web database.
Based on data contained in the Gene Ontology Annotation (GOA) Database [32] and in the Gene Ontology
Database [29], Perl scripts were prepared to create a local
database with all the protein-GO associations including
no-direct links due to "is_a" relations among different GO
elements. Information contained in the database tables

was used to produce statistics on the ontologies distribution. According to the distribution of GO IDs in the GO
Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG), statistics were created representing the participation of the grape gene set in the different GO categories. As for the grape genes collection, GO
statistics were also created for the putative target genes

dataset that was deduced from FindMiRNA output. Each
time a gene is targeted by a FindMiRNA prediction, it is
included in this dataset, so that genes that are targeted
more than once are represented in multiple copies. Comparing distributions of hits in GO classes from the two sets
of statistics allows to highlight over- or under-targeted categories, and to retrieve corresponding predictions. In the
GrapeMiRNA web tool, graphical display and browsing of
ontology classes is obtained via the PHP-based web interface, that produces graphical bars and matching ontologies percentages upon users' requests. GO classes are
represented as proportional bars, carrying aside the percentage of hits matching each class. Bars can be clicked to
move hierarchically across categories, and hits matching
each category can be retrieved. To facilitate picking up of
GO categories where statistically significant differences
between the two datasets are observed, a chi-squared analysis was performed on a generic GO slim [33], and a table
of results is published at the corresponding web page. In
the table, the number of hits for each dataset matching the
GO categories contained in the GO slim, normalized to a
sample dataset of 30,000 sequences, is displayed. In the
table nodes, links to the corresponding proportional bars
are active, so that retrieval of matching hits is granted.
UniProt identifiers associated to annotated grape
sequences were used to relate sequences to the 345 molecular pathways that are described at the KEGG Pathway
database [31]. UniProt-pathway inter-relationships were
deduced from association files available at the KEGG ftp
site.

Utility and discussion
De novo microRNA identification and predictions
selection
The FindMiRNA algorithm was used to predict putative
miRNAs and their targets in the grape genome. FindMiRNA identifies miRNA-like hairpin structures in intergenic regions having putative targets in genic sequences,
and its output is thus independent from comparative
genomics approaches. To assess the presence of predictions that are conserved across species, FindMiRNA's
authors implemented the PrecExtract program, that looks
for the presence of putative pre-miRs having the same
mature sequences as those predicted by FindMiRNA in
other genomes. Unfortunately, plant pre-miRs share their
features with other non-coding RNAs and other types of
foldback elements, so these structures are also reported in
FindMiRNA output together with putative miRNAs, as no
other miRNA-distinctive feature is taken into account during the FindMiRNA analysis. Furthermore, difficulties are
encountered by the program in assigning the 5' end of the
miRNA sequence based on miRNA-target base pairing. As
a result of these considerations, the FindMiRNA output
contains a plethora of predictions that need to be vali-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/82

dated with complementary methods to select the most
reliable miRNA-like structures. In recent years, knowledge
about miRNA structure and features has been expanded,
and new parameters can be adopted to discriminate
among predictions. Applying combined filters to our predictions dataset, only about 0.74% of the original FindMiRNA predictions was selected. Among the parameters
that were adopted to discriminate among predictions, the
self-containment score was the most efficient in slashing
the predictions number. The resulting dataset still contains a significant intrinsic redundancy, due to the fact
that multiple predictions are produced in overlapping
regions when more than one hairpin structure can be predicted, or when miRNA-like structures are detected on
both genomic strands. According to these assumptions,
predictions ranking was mandatory. The three ranking
procedures that were applied to the dataset of selected predictions allow not only to focus on miRNA-containing
genomic regions, but also to focus on genes sharing the
same targets or on miRNA families.
Predictions validation by comparison to other sequences
After selection of predictions according to their sequence
and structural features, an effort was made to classify predictions and to validate FindMiRNA combined with the
adopted parameters and thresholds as effective instruments for de novo identification. Comparisons of predictions with previously described miRNAs, EST sequences
and other genomes were performed with the dual aim of
in silico validation and individuation of good candidates
for in vitro analysis. The selected predictions dataset contains members from only 17 out the 28 miRNA families
that are reported for grape in miRBase. Even if all the
grape miRBase mature miRNA sequences can be recovered
by BLAST analysis on the IASMA Pinot noir genome (data
not shown), FindMiRNA and further prediction selection
with our thresholds failed to recover more than one third
of the represented miRNA families. Nonetheless, it is
worth noting that searches for homologues to known
structural RNA families that were carried out with Infernal
confirmed these results without identifying possible
members from further miRNA families (data not shown).
This problem can partially be ascribed to sequence or gene
prediction differences between the two grape genomes,
but it is likely that part of the missing families are not
detected due to procedural problems. An insight in the
'mirna' database table reveals that no additional miRNA
family is reported with respect to those included in the
'selected_predictions' table, thus failure in their detection
cannot be ascribed to excessively stringent cutoffs.

Comparisons of FindMiRNA predictions with the At and
grape Genoscope genomes by PrecExtract and BLAST were
performed to validate predictions as cross-species conservation is an established trait for miRNAs. Nonetheless, the

Page 11 of 13
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Plant Biology 2009, 9:82

independency of the FindMiRNA algorithm from crossspecies validation grants the possibility to recover speciesspecific miRNAs, that are not detected by comparative
genomics-based approaches. 858 predictions having
matches with almost one of the two compared genomes
were individuated by PrecExtract, 189 of which were also
confirmed by BLAST. By comparison of FindMiRNA output precursors with ESTs, 32 putative precursors matching
eight un-annotated ESTs were identified. These are likely
to correspond to miRNA genes which pri-miRs were
cloned to ESTs.

Conclusion
Even if the adopted procedure was not sensitive enough to
recover all known miRNA families in the IASMA genome,
among the selected predictions a significant number of
homologues to the At and Genoscope Pinot noir genomes
was recovered, and precursors sharing their sequence with
putative priMIRs that were cloned to ESTs were also
retrieved. According to these results, we can assume that it
is likely that predictions available at the GrapeMiRNA
web site contain a discrete number of good candidates for
validation. Nonetheless, eventual in vitro validation studies must take into account the possibility that mature
miRNA sequences proposed by FindMiRNA could be
almost in part imprecise, and their boundaries should be
carefully inspected or broadened.
The GrapeMiRNA public interface was structured to allow
researchers to focus on genomic regions or targeted genes
of interest, and retrieve corresponding miRNA predictions. Even if predictions require validation and must be
inspected with caution, we believe that the computational
effort that was required to perform the FindMiRNA analysis and the accessory analyses that were carried out to
enrich predictions-related information cannot be easily
reproduced without the aid of sophisticated hardware
configurations. The overall procedure that led to the completion of the GrapeMiRNA web database involved the
preparation of several parsers, scripts and accessory programs that allowed extracting relevant results from programs' outputs and organizing them in the database
tables. The FindMiRNA, PrecExtract and Infernal analyses
were carried out on a computer cluster, using a significant
number of nodes. Further tools were developed to relate
predictions to information concerning targeted genes,
including the statistical analysis on distribution of grape
genes and putative target genes in ontology classes. The
resulting database includes a significant amount of data
that can be of use in mining miRNA distribution across a
plant genome and in selecting candidate miRNAs for in
vitro validation.
