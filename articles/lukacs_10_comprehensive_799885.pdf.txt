Abstract
Background: We have previously sequenced more than 500 kb of the duplicated MHC class I regions in Atlantic
salmon. In the IA region we identified the loci for the MHC class I gene Sasa-UBA in addition to a soluble MHC
class I molecule, Sasa-ULA. A pseudolocus for Sasa-UCA was identified in the nonclassical IB region. Both regions
contained genes for antigen presentation, as wells as orthologues to other genes residing in the human MHC
region.
Results: The genomic localisation of two MHC class I lineages (Z and S) has been resolved. 7 BACs were
sequenced using a combination of standard Sanger and 454 sequencing. The new sequence data extended the IA
region with 150 kb identifying the location of one Z-lineage locus, ZAA. The IB region was extended with 350 kb
including three new Z-lineage loci, ZBA, ZCA and ZDA in addition to a UGA locus. An allelic version of the IB region
contained a functional UDA locus in addition to the UCA pseudolocus. Additionally a BAC harbouring two MHC
class I genes (UHA) was placed on linkage group 14, while a BAC containing the S-lineage locus SAA (previously
known as UAA) was placed on LG10. Gene expression studies showed limited expression range for all class I genes
with exception of UBA being dominantly expressed in gut, spleen and gills, and ZAA with high expression in blood.
Conclusion: Here we describe the genomic organization of MHC class I loci from the U-, Z-, and S-lineages in
Atlantic salmon. Nine of the described class I genes are located in the extension of the duplicated IA and IB
regions, while three class I genes are found on two separate linkage groups. The gene organization of the two
regions indicates that the IB region is evolving at a different pace than the IA region. Expression profiling,
polymorphic content, peptide binding properties and phylogenetic relationship show that Atlantic salmon has only
one MHC class Ia gene (UBA), in addition to a multitude of nonclassical MHC class I genes from the U-, S- and
Z-lineages.

Background
Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules have important roles in presenting antigens to
immune cells thereby enabling the organism to discriminate between self and non-self. In humans, the MHC
genomic region is a gene dense region covering more
than 4 Mb and encodes MHC class I and II molecules
in addition to numerous other immune related molecules. The classical MHC region is located on chromosome 6, while duplicated regions are found on
chromosomes 1, 9 and 19, resulting from two whole* Correspondence: unni.grimholt@bio.uio.no

genome duplications [1]. The primary form of the MHC
class I molecule consists of an alpha chain, stabilized by
a b2-microglobulin (b2 m) molecule.
MHC class I molecules are at present divided into two
main categories; classical MHC class I (or Ia) and nonclassical MHC class I (or Ib) where the latter category
contains a multitude of molecules with various ligand
binding abilities. MHC class Ia molecules are extremely
polymorphic and expressed in most cells where they
present self and nonself peptides primarily to CD8+
T-cells. In humans the MHC class Ia molecules are
encoded by the HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C loci. The
MHC class Ib molecules are less polymorphic and have
a more restricted tissue distribution. The MHC class Ib
family include the peptide binders like HLA-E, HLA-F,

HLA-G. Additionally lipid binders like CD1, non-ligand
binders like MIC-A/B and HFE, and other molecules
like MR1, ZAG, FcRn and ULBP have features of MHC
class Ib character. An emerging view on the MHC class
Ib molecules are their prominent role bridging the
innate and acquired immunity [2].
Teleost fishes also display a wide variety of MHC class
I molecules, and earlier reports classify these genes into
the U-, Z- and L-lineage based on evolutionary relationship [3,4]. However information regarding polymorphic
content, expression patterns and ligand binding are
mostly lacking for these MHC class I genes. The broad
U-lineage is present in most teleosts, covering both
MHC class Ia and Ib sequences. Z-lineage molecules
have now been identified in a multitude of teleosts
[4-6]. L-lineage molecules are so far only found in salmonids and cyprinids, and represent highly divergent
class Ib genes [3].
All teleost fishes have their MHC class I and II
regions located on different linkage groups [7,8], an
event thought to have emerged by a genome duplication
event early in the teleost evolution [9]. A unique salmonid specific genome duplication event occurring 60 mya
[10,11] resulted in a duplicated MHC class I region
residing on different chromosomes in salmonids [8,12]
and the two regions are denoted class IA and class IB
[11,13]. The classical UBA locus in addition to a ULA
locus lacking a transmembrane region reside in the IA
region, while a class Ib pseudolocus UCA was found in
the Atlantic salmon IB region [13]. This is in contrast
to what was found in rainbow trout, where the IA
region only contained a UBA locus and the IB region
contained three expressed nonclassical genes (UCA,
UDA and UEA) in addition to one UFA pseudolocus
[11]. Studies by Kiryu et al and Miller et al [14,15]
revealed the existence of additional MHC class I loci in
salmonids (UGA, UHA and ZE), although the genomic
location of these loci remained unclear. Additionally, a
class I molecule first reported by Shum et al. [16], was
defined as if belonging to the U-lineage (UAA), despite
its phylogenetic divergence from traditionally U-lineage
molecules. An equally divergent class I molecule defined
as the L-lineage was reported by Dijkstra et al [3] in
rainbow trout, Atlantic salmon, zebrafish and fathead
minnow.
Here we describe the genomic organization of U-, Z-,
and S-lineage MHC class I genes in Atlantic salmon,
where SAA (S-lineage) replaces the UAA nomenclature
because of its distant phylogenetic relationship to any
other class I molecules. Additionally expression profiling, polymorphism, peptide binding properties and
phylogenetic relationship were studied to further characterize the MHC class I molecules.

Results and discussion
Characterization and sequencing of BAC clones

An Atlantic salmon BAC library was screened with
probes for UHA, UAA and ZE, and positive BACs were
ordered into contigs using restriction fragment analysis
together with GRASP HindIII fingerprint information.
After PCR verification that the BACs contained
sequence of interest, 184H23 and 114L13 were chosen
as sequencing candidates for UHA and UAA respectively. We rename UAA to SAA (see arguments below)
and will use this definition throughout the paper.
The ZE positive BACs clustered into two contigs and
were shown to represent extensions of sequenced BACs
in the duplicated MHC class I regions based on fingerprint data [13]. 129P21 was chosen from the IA region,
while 68O19 for the IB region. 439H13 was later chosen and sequenced to obtain a continuous sequence of
the IB region and the overlapping sequence of 439H13
and 68O19 showed 100% sequence identity over 11055
bp. An overview of the genomic position of all
sequenced BACs covering the IA and IB regions is
shown in Figure 1.
In our previous study we identified two BACs (439J08,
357C09) positive for an allelic version of the IB region
since PCR analysis revealed that these two BAC clones
possessed different UCA-like sequences [13]. Thus they
were chosen as sequencing candidates. Additionally we
chose to sequence a BAC that was PCR positive for
UGA (222F07).
The BACs 439J08, 222F07, 184H23, 114L13 and
357C09 were initially sequenced using 454 technologies.
Later Sanger shotgun libraries were made and
sequenced to close gaps for 439J08, 114L13 and
184H23. The remaining BAC clones 129P21, 439H13
and 68O19 were subjected to Sanger sequencing only.
Our additional sequence data i.e. 129P21 extends the
Atlantic salmon IA region to cover 650 kb, while the IB
region being extended with 222F07, 439H13 and 68O19
now covers 870 kb. 439J08 was indeed an allelic variant
of the previously IB representative 8I14, with an insertion of 50 kb that increased the total described IB region
to 920 kb.
To identify the genomic location of the SAA and
UHA positive BACs they were mapped in a mapping
reference panel to linkage groups 10 and linkage group
14 respectively [17] (Additional File 1). The IA region
containing the classical locus UBA resides on linkage
group 15 while the nonclassical IB region is located on
linkage group 3 [13]. An association between linkage
groups and chromosomes can be found in Phillips et al
[18].
The BAC clones were submitted to Genbank and have
the following accession numbers 114L13 [134379 bp,

Genomic surroundings of Atlantic salmon U-, S-,
and Z- lineage genes

We have used nomenclature with IA covering the UBA
locus region and IB for the duplicated UCA/UDA
region. New genes identified here will be named accordingly; the IA genes are given an extension of a (e.g.
RING1a) and the IB genes have an extension of b (e.g.
RING1b). Previously identified MHC class I molecules
from the Z-lineage have been termed ZE with allelic
extensions. We here propose that the four Z-lineage loci
should be named with three letters as used for other
MHC class I genes i.e ZAA; first letter - describing lineage, second letter - increasing letters A, B, C and D to
reflect locus and the last letter - A for alpha chain.
A MHC class I gene residing in 114L13 was originally
defined as UAA in rainbow trout by Shum [16]. Here
we rename this gene to SAA to visualize the fact that
this molecule shows very low identity to other U-lineage
molecules (this nomenclature will also be used for the
rainbow trout molecule, i.e. Onmy-SAA). We propose
that the lineage should be designated as S as this class I
lineage was first described in salmonids. The gene organization of U-, S- and Z-lineage containing regions are
shown in Figure 1. 439J08 represents an allelic version
of the IB region residing on LG3 thus denoted LG3-2.
Genes for ZAA, ATF6a and TNXBa were found in the
extended IA region. The IB region was extended with
genes for UGA, RING1b, RPS18b, VPS52b, VHSVb,
ATF6b, TNXBb, PSMB7, CENPA, ZBA, ZCA, ZDA,
ATAD2, ZHX1, ZHX2. We also found four almost identical genes in the extended IB region which had several
EST matches [ex. Genbank: EG844714] and we define
them as Hypothetical (Figure 1) as their functions are
currently unknown. The three first genes were 100%
identical on a protein level, while the last gene contained one amino acid substitution. Genes identified in
114L13 on LG10 were SAA, VWA5A, VWA5A-homolog,
AKT2, and in 184H23 two UHA genes (UHA1 and
UHA2) were identified in addition to AhR1, AhR2,
AGPAT3 and PDXK.
The gene TNXB was found in both the IA and IB
regions, being an Atlantic salmon ortholog of a gene
residing in the extended human MHC class III region.
TNXB is a member of the tenascin family of extracellular matrix glycoproteins, which has anti-adhesive effects
and functions in matrix maturation during wound

healing [19]. ATF6 was also identified in both regions.
The human ATF6-beta (CREBL1) is located close to
TNXB on chromosome 6, while ATF6-alpha is located
on chromosome 1. ATF6-beta functions as a transcription factor in the unfolded protein response pathway
during endoplasmatic reticulum stress [19].
We also found genes in the IB region that we have previously found in the IA region; RING1, RPS18, VPS52
and VHSV. Some of these genes were quite divergent
from their IA counterparts with 91%, 100%, 75% and 70%
amino acid identity respectively. VPS52 in the IB region
is probably a pseudogene, since the gene only consisted
of 293 amino acids (aa) compared to 773 aa in IA. However, VPS52 showed 100% identity toward a predicted
CDS in Genbank [ACM08348], thus indicating that this
IB genes is still expressed. VPS52 in humans is located
on chromosome 6 in a head-to-head orientation with the
gene encoding ribosomal protein S18.
The ATAD2, ZHX1 and ZHX2 genes identified in the
extended IB region have an identical gene orientation as
that found on human chromosome 8. ATAD2 belongs
to a large family of ATPases and these proteins often
perform chaperone-like functions that assist in the
assembly, operation and disassembly of protein complexes [19]. Members of the zinc fingers and homeoboxes gene family (i.e. ZHX1 and ZHX2) are nuclear
homodimeric transcriptional repressors that interact
with the A subunit of nuclear factor-Y (NF-YA) and
contain two C2H2-type zinc fingers and five homeobox
DNA-binding domains [19].
We found a cDNA match for PSMB7 (proteasome
subunit Z; [Genbank: BT046757]) which is a subunit of
the 20S proteasome subunit complex in the IB region.
Perhaps a duplicated PSMB7 gene exists in Atlantic salmon as another sequence [Genbank: ACI68005] showed
68% identity on the protein level. PSMB7 is located on
chromosome 9 in humans and on chromosome 21 in
zebrafish (i.e. the gene is not MHC linked) as the
human and zebrafish MHC region resides on chr.6 and
chr.19 respectively.
Genes identified in the UHA and SAA positive BACs
were two AhR genes, AGPAT3 and PDXK in 184H23
and VWA5A and AKT2 in 114L13. The AhR2 gene
shows high similarity towards a Genbank mRNA
sequence ([Genbank: AY219864]; more than 99% identity), but lacks exon1 and 2. Hansson et al described
three Atlantic salmon AhR2 genes (alpha, beta and
gamma) and two AhR1 genes (alpha and beta), all containing a minimum of 11 exons [20]. Either the two
lacking AhR2 exons are located upstream of 184H23 or
this gene is a pseudogene with a functional copy somewhere else. We found no matching EST for the predicted AhR1 gene which we then define as a
pseudogene.

AGPAT3 and PDXK have also been identified in zebrafish located on chromosome 1. AGPAT3 shows 83%
identity to one Genbank EST [Genbank: ACI33566]
whilst another EST clone [Genbank: DW540133] shows
93% identity suggestive of a duplicated locus elsewhere.
This gene is highly conserved with the salmon sequence
displaying more than 74% identity towards orthologs in
mammals such as human, horse and pig. AGPAT3 is
involved in the second step in the de novo phospholipid
biosynthetic pathway where AGPAT3 is an acyltransferase that converts lysophosphatidic acid into phosphatidic acid [19]. PDXK phosphorylates vitamin B6, a step
required for the conversion of vitamin B6 to pyridoxal5-phosphate, an important cofactor in intermediary

metabolism [19]. We found two copies of VWA5A,
which Martin et al show might function as a candidate
tumor supressor gene in man and the gene is located on
human chromosome 11q23-q24 [21].
Table 1 shows alternative nomenclature and matching
ESTs for described genes. Other open reading frames
were also identified, but they were associated with transposon related repetitive elements.
Atlantic salmon MHC Class I genes

In the IA region only one new MHC class I locus was
identified (ZAA). In the IB region, a functional UDA
locus was identified 50 kb upstream of the UCA pseudo
locus in addition to the UGA locus and three Z-lineage

loci (ZBA, ZCA and ZDA). Figure 2 shows exon and

MHC class I genes from the U-, Z- and S-lineages.
U-lineage
Sasa-UDA and Sasa-UCAψ

The 439J08 BAC is an allelic version of the IB region
previously sequenced and represented by the BAC 8I14
[13]. Previously we identified only one MHC class I
gene, the UCA pseudo locus in the IB region. A similar
pseudo locus was also identified in the allelic 439J08
BAC showing 93% sequence identity towards the UCAψ
in 8I14. We thus named the previously reported UCA
allele UCAψ *0101, whilst the allele in 439J08 is named
UCAψ *0201. The UCAψ *0201 allele contains an identical internal stop codon as in UCAψ *0101 allele making
this a pseudogene as well. The UCAψ *0201 allele in
439J08 shows 93% sequence identity towards the UCAψ
*0101 allele in 8I14.
439J08 contains a duplicated MHC class I locus residing approximately 50 kb upstream of UCAψ *0201,
which we named Sasa-UDA. Dijkstra et al. [22] found a
similar haplotype variation in rainbow trout. We found
an EST match for this UDA locus [Genbank:

GE768625], which is fully intact and expressed. The
439J08 UDA allele shows 95% sequence identity towards
the UCAψ *0101 allele in 8I14. Sasa-UDA showed 90%
identity towards rainbow trout UDA*0301 [Genbank:
AY523671] and 89% identity to Onmy-UCA*0301 [Genbank: AY523661]. Only a limited polymorphism was
observed in the few EST or full-length cDNAs available
for UCA and UDA sequences. Further studies are
needed to assess the polymorphic content for Atlantic
salmon UCA and UDA loci in comparison to what Dijkstra et al. described in rainbow trout [22].
Comparing the region between UCAψ and COLLA2,
there is approx 98% identity between the 8I14 (LG3-1)
and 439J08 (LG3-2) sequences, while the 439J08
sequence upstream of the UCA locus has no identity to
8I14 apart from the UDA locus. Sequence comparison
shows that there is 100% identity for the other encoded
proteins in 439J08 and 8I14. The partial sequence of
357C09, being an extended version of 439J08, did contain genes for TAPBP, DAXX, ZBTB22, KIFC1, FLOT1
and TUBB upstream of the UDA locus similar to what
is found in the IA region. As the 357C09 sequence consists of 20 unlinked contigs the exact organization of
these genes in the IB region remains unknown.

Sasa-UGA

The Sasa-UGA locus is inserted in the IB region
between the genes for SLC39A and RING1. Multiple
salmon ESTs matched this locus [Genbank: CB498868
and CA043257] and assembled together (GRASP cluster
280267) they provide a full-length Sasa-UGA cDNA
sequence with 81% sequence identity towards rainbow
trout UGA [Genbank: AAP04358].
Sasa-UHA

The two Sasa UHA genes identified in 184H23 were
named UHA1 and UHA2 and both loci have matching
ESTs. The duplicated UHA1 and UHA2 loci both
showed more than 93% identity towards ESTs previously
named UHA and UHB by Miller et al [15]. A distinct
difference between UHA1 and UHA2 is a three nucleotide insertion (an extra amino acid) in the a2-domain in
UHA2. UHA1 and UHA2 are oriented in the same
direction and show high similarity towards each other,
but approximately 40-50% identity towards other
U-linage molecules. Two different ESTs matching the
UHA1 locus were identified, and they are most likely
splice variants. UHA1*0101 [Genbank: EG787974] contains 10 exons, while UHA1*0201 [Genbank: DW548896]
contains 7 exons, with the last exon containing only a
stop-codon. UHA1*0201 contains an inserted exon consisting of 32 bp after the a3 domain (exon4), which contributes to an earlier stop in the CDS compared to
(UHA1*0101). The nomenclature used for these splice
variants is only temporary, awaiting a nomenclature
debate.
S-lineage

The SAA locus identified in 114L13 showed 96% aa
identity to Onmy-SAA*0101 [Genbank: AAB57877], and
we found a matching Atlantic salmon EST [Genbank:
DY713846]. As mentioned above, the salmonid SAA
sequence shows very little similarity towards other
U-lineage genes, with for instance approx 30% identity
to Sasa-UBA alleles. Sasa-SAA*0101 is a compact class I
gene with small intron sizes compared to the other
MHC class I genes. Sasa-SAA*0101 contains the same
characteristics as Onmy-SAA*0101 [16] with six exons
and five introns, and an incapacitated transposable element in intron 3.
Z-lineage

We found 4 Z-lineage genes, one in the extended IA
region and three in the extended IB region and this is in
accordance with Miller et al [15] who identified four
different ZE exon 2 sequences. The previously reported
Atlantic salmon Sasa-ZE*0101 sequence [Genbank:
DQ099914] shows 91% sequence identity towards the
IA linked ZAA locus, and most likely emerged from this
locus. The ZAA sequence in the 129P21 BAC is named

Sasa-ZAA*0201, while the previously reported sequence
Sasa-ZE*0101 should be renamed Sasa-ZAA*0101.
We have also identified matching EST clones for ZBA
[Genbank: DY730127 and EG827413] and ZCA [Genbank:
DY740683 and DW559009] making these bona-fide genes,
while ZDA lacks the leader peptide suggestive of a pseudogene. ZBA*0101 and ZCA*0101 show 96% sequence
identity over 918 bp, while the remaining 3’ sequence
shows little sequence identity.
Comparing the separate exons of all the Z-lineage
genes (ZAA, ZBA, ZCA, ZDAψ), the highest sequence
identity overall was found in exon2 and exon3, ranging
from 89-96% identity for exon2, 84-92% identity for
exon3, while exon4 showed 69-86% identity (data not
shown). Comparing the different exons of ZBA*0101
and ZCA*0101 we found 95%, 92% and 86% identity in
exon2, exon3 and exon4 respectively. They are all orientated in a head to tail fashion.
The exon-intron organization of the four Z-lineage
MHC class I genes are quite different with 5, 6, 4 and 4
exons for ZAA, ZBA, ZCA and ZDAψ respectively. The
connecting peptide, transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail
domains are all encoded by exon 5 in ZAA. In ZBA, this
region in encoded by exons 5 and 6 where the transmembrane region has been lost. In ZCA, the 4th exon is
larger than for any other class I gene and encodes the
a3 domain in addition to the connecting peptide, transmembrane and cytoplasmic region. However this exonintron organization is truly unorthodox. A sequence
comparison of the ZBA sequence with the genomic
region downstream of the ZCA a3 domain showed that
a similar exon-intron organisation as in ZBA could be
identified for ZCA as well. Thus the ESTs identified for
the ZCA gene could be splicoforms.
Phylogenetic analysis of fish MHC class I molecules

The MHC class I amino acid sequences from the U-, S-,
Z- and L-lineages in addition to MHC class I sequences
from various fishes, man and shark were used to draw a
phylogenetic tree (Figure 3 and Additional File 2). With
bootstrap values ranging from 90-100% the U, Z, L and S
sequences form distinct clusters. Most published fish class
I sequences belong to the U-lineage, while the Z-lineage
so far contains sequences from fewer teleost species
including the pufferfish family, zebrafishes, carp and
Japanese flounder. L-lineage class I molecules are so
far only identified in zebrafish, fathead minnow and
salmonids, while class I sequences from the S-lineage are
only found in catfish and salmonids.
Among the Atlantic salmon U-lineage class I sequences
there is a close relationship between the Sasa-UBA and
Sasa-ULA suggesting that ULA is a recent duplication
of UBA. An ULA homolog is so far not identified in
rainbow trout. Sasa-UDA and Sasa-UGA cluster on

separate nodes together with their rainbow trout homologs. Overall, the U-lineage sequences from all teleosts
cluster together with their taxonomic superorder
families, that is; acanthopterygii, protacanthopterygii and
ostariophysi. One exception is the Sasa-UHA1 and
Sasa-UHA2 that branch off early on a separate node
from all other U-lineage sequences, showing a more distant phylogenetic relationship. Whether the UHA
sequences diverged this early as the phylogenetic tree
indicates stands as an open debate as the UHA genes
are located on a separate linkage group (LG14), suggesting a separate evolutionary origin from the other U-lineage located on linkage group 3 and 15. Interestingly, the

a3 domain (exon 4) of the UHA molecules shows very
low amino acid conservation in comparison to other
U-lineage genes. Likewise, the human nonclassical gene
MR1 [23], show a similar identity in the a1 and a2
domains towards the classical counterparts (HLA-A,
HLA-B and HLA-C) while the a3 domain is more divergent. The functional relevance of this lack of conservation remains unknown.
The Z-lineage molecules also cluster together with
their taxonomic superorder families, although including
fewer sequences than the U-lineage sequences. So far
the Atlantic salmon is the only teleost species reported,
with 3 different expressed Z-lineage genes.

The Atlantic salmon S-lineage molecule shows a close
relationship to the Onmy-SAA molecule. Based on their
sequence identity, both molecules seem to have evolved
very little following the divergence of these two species
[24].
Expression of Atlantic salmon MHC class I genes

One of the definitions of a MHC class Ia gene is that it
is expressed in most tissues. To investigate the expression patterns of Atlantic salmon MHC class I molecules,
blood, foregut, hindgut, head kidney, gills, spleen, liver,
eye, tongue, skin, muscle, heart and brain samples were
taken from three Atlantic salmon individuals and analyzed for gene expression by quantitative real-time PCR
(Figure 4). To evaluate the expression patterns from the
heart, blood was included as sample to differentiate
between the expression patterns in heart structural
tissue.
Highest expression for UBA was observed in foregut,
hindgut, spleen and gills, while moderate expression was
observed in blood and heart. Lowest expression was
observed in tongue, liver and brain. Without using an
absolute quantification method i.e. including a standard
curve, it is not possible to compare different genes for

Page 9 of 17

same tissues, however the transcriptional level of other
MHC class I genes were low in comparison to UBA
with the exception of UGA in blood. In general, the
high expression of UBA in comparison to the other
MHC class I genes, is also supported by hits found in
databases. Various BlastN, BlastX, and TBlastN searches
in Genbank [25] and cGRASP [26,27] using UBA
sequences hit numerous sequences, while blasting with
other U-, S-, or Z-lineage sequences results in generally
few hits.
We found that ULA had highest expression in tongue,
and lower in skin and heart. In contrast to our results,
Miller et al [15] found that ULA was only weakly
expressed in posterior kidney in un-infected fish, while
expression was up-regulated in IHNV-infected liver,
brain and eye tissues. They did not detect expression in
the heart of un-infected nor infected tissues. UDA
showed little variation in expression patterns between
the different tissues tested. The remaining nonclassical
U-lineage class I genes, UHA1, UHA2 and UGA all
showed the highest expression in blood.
Expression analysis of the Z-lineage genes showed that
ZAA had highest expression in blood, while lower
expression in the heart, spleen, gills and hindgut. ZBA

was 2-fold more expressed in the heart than in the
spleen, but lower in the other tissues. The Z-lineage
genes seem ubiquitously expressed in most tissues tested
similar to that observed by Miller et al [15]. Little difference in expression patterns for the various tissues was
observed for the SAA gene.
Both ULA and ZBA lack transmembrane, connecting
peptide and cytoplasmic domains and probably are
secreted MHC class I molecules. Based on their expression patterns they could have specific functions in the
heart. The Z-lineage expression such as ZAA in blood
and heart, and ZBA in the heart, suggest interesting
functions to be unravelled.
During the initial studies we checked the PCR products amplified during realtime PCR on agarose gels,
and observed that products for UHA1 contained two
bands that were equally expressed, with exception in
muscle where the smallest band was missing. Sequencing of these PCR products showed that the largest fragment represented the UHA1*0201 allele with the
additional exon, while the smallest PCR product represented the UHA1*0101 allele.
We have only investigated un-stimulated tissues, and
it is most likely that the expression patterns would be
different in stimulated tissues. Based on expression patterns and polymorphic content only UBA can be classified as a true classical MHC class I gene, while the
others should be classified as nonclassical MHC
molecules.
Structure and function of Atlantic salmon MHC
class I molecules

Structure and composition of MHC class I genes are
quite variable both within and between vertebrate
groups, with the a1a2 domains containing most of the
polymorphism. In mammals, the presence of nine evolutionary conserved sites within the a1a2 domains have
been defined as residues that anchor the peptide [28,29].
These residues are highly conserved in classical as well
as in most nonclassical molecules like HLA-E, HLA-F
and HLA-G. The set of residues in mammals are
YYYYYYTKW, while in non-mammalian vertebrates it
has changed slightly to YYYYRFTKW [16,23]. Deduced
Atlantic salmon MHC class I amino acid sequences
identified in our BACs in addition to a sequence belonging to the L-lineage (LBA) [Genbank: DY733800 and
GO062643] were aligned with human MHC class I
sequences (Figure 5). Presence of conserved peptide
anchoring sites for all Atlantic salmon class I sequences
including human, chicken and shark are summarized in
Table 2.
For the MHC class I UBA locus we included two
highly divergent alleles, where UBA*0301 contains the
non-mammalian motif while UBA*1001 differ in one

Page 10 of 17

residue, A7. One or rarely two substitutions of these
conserved residues have also been observed in both
human and mouse MHC class Ia sequences [28,29]. The
ULA locus described as a secretory class I molecule due
to a missing transmembrane domain [13], does display
the conserved motif for non mammalian vertebrates,
and may thus still bind peptides. The two UHA loci
have one residue different from the classical UBA locus
at F59. A tyrosine/phenylalanine substitution is common
amongst non mammalian vertebrates, and may not
interfere with binding capacity. The UDA and UGA
have two and three residues different from UBA. These
are not conservative substitutions (e.g. Y/F), and most
likely influence peptide-binding. Overall it seems like all
the U-lineage sequences in Atlantic salmon are able to
present peptides based on these nine anchor residues.
Both SAA and LBA sequences have quite different
residues in some or all of these positions when compared against the UBA classical class I sequences. Seven
of the nine residues are found to differ from the nonmammalian motif in SAA sequences, while all of the
nine residues are found to differ in LBA sequences. In
mammals, the class Ib molecule CD1, known to bind
lipid and glycolipid ligands do not contain this peptide
binding motif [2]. Thus it is likely that SAA and LBA
binds non-peptide ligands or none at all as the mammalian class Ib molecules MIC-A/B and HFE. In rainbow
trout, Shum et al concluded that Onmy-SAA (similar to
Sasa-SAA) has properties indicative of a particularly
divergent class Ib gene [16].
The Z-lineage sequences also follow the non mammalian motif with the exception of one common different
residue, F171. Three amino acids downstream of F171,
all Z-lineage sequences have a tyrosine (Y) residue
which might function as the conserved peptide anchoring residue. This has also been observed in cyprinid
class I ZE sequences which suggests that use of the tyrosine Y174 might affect and extend the peptide binding
groove, leading to binding of somewhat larger peptides
[5]. Another possibility is that a substitution of a tyrosine (Y) residue by a phenylalanine (F) in position Y171
may not have major implications for the ability to bind
peptide termini since most non mammalian MHC class
Ia sequences have a similar substitution of a tyrosine
residue by a phenylalanine residue at position Y123.
In humans there is a stretch from aa 231-244 in the
class I a3 domain known to interact with b2 m [30]. In
this region, the UHA and all Z-, S- and L-lineage
sequences have a specific motif, P235, Y241 and R244,
which may influence the association with b2 m. Atlantic
salmon express up to twelve different b2 m molecules
(unpublished data), which group into two lineages, BA1
[Genbank: AF180478] and BA6 [Genbank: AF180484]
which may stabilize different MHC class I sequences;

[Genbank: AF034316] and HLA-A2 [Genbank: AAA76608].

one lineage may bind to UHA, Z-, S- and L -lineage
molecules and the other b2 m lineage may bind and stabilize the remaining U-lineage molecules that also show
a conservation in this region. In humans, there are also
at least four class Ib molecules that do not bind b2 m
(MICA/B, EPCR, ULBP and ZAG) [2]. Future studies
are needed to clarify b2 m binding of salmonid MHC
class I molecules.
Other features that are shared between the Atlantic
salmon class I molecules and nearly all MHC class Ia
and Ib molecules of other vertebrates, include 4 conserved cysteine residues located in the a2a3 domains
forming disulfide bonds within theses domains and the
highly conserved FYP motif at positions 208-210 aa in
the a3 domain [28]. Most class I sequences contain an
N-linked glycosylation site near the end of the a1
domain. The amino acid residues which correspond to
the CD8 binding site of the HLA-A locus are at positions 223-229 in the Atlantic salmon sequences. Both
classical and some nonclassical mammalian MHC class I
molecules have a well conserved negatively charged
CD8 binding site in the a3 domain (ca.218-226). Here
the Atlantic salmon classical UBA molecules have an
acidic stretch consisting of 4 negatively charged aa (D
or E), also found in the ULA, UGA and UDA molecules.
The UHA1 and UHA2 molecules consist of 2 and 3
negatively charged aa respectively. The SAA molecule
has 1, while the Z molecules has from 2 to 3 negatively
charged aa in the this region. Both CD8a and CD8b
chains have been described in the Atlantic salmon [31].

The CD8 molecule can be expressed both in a homodimeric and heterodimeric form, where the latter is most
expressed in mammals, preferably in circulating lymphocytes. The lower acidic content in this region for the
UHA, SAA and Z molecules may influence the lymphocyte interactions in contrast to the higher acidic content
for UBA, ULA, UGA and UDA molecules.
Having classified the Atlantic salmon class I molecules
into functional categories based on traditional criterions,
the functional properties of these molecules still remain
unclear. Sasa-ULA and Sasa-ZBA exists in a soluble
form, while the Sasa-UHA1 locus expresses both membrane bound and a soluble variant as a result of alternative splicing, leading to loss of the Tm/Cyt domain by a
frame shift. In humans, both MHC class Ia and Ib molecules are also known to exist in soluble forms. The classical HLA-A, -B and -C loci express soluble variants
that play a role in cell death of activated T cells [32].
Another example is the human non-classical HLA-G
molecules that exist in several different isoforms both
membrane bound and secreted forms where the soluble
variant is caused by alternative splicing where the Tm/
Cyt domains are deleted [33]. The soluble HLA-G is
found expressed specifically in placental tissue and is
secreted during pregnancy [34] and also thought to be
involved in inducing apoptosis in activated maternal
CD8+ T cells [35]. The functional relevance of soluble
class I molecules remain to be established in fish.

Conclusion
Here we describe the genomic organization of U-, Z-,
and S-lineage MHC class I molecules in Atlantic salmon. Nine of the described class I genes are located in
the extension of the duplicated IA and IB regions, while
three class I genes are found on two separate linkage
groups. The gene organization of the two regions indicates that the IB region is evolving at a different pace
than the IA region. The IB region contains 3 chitin
synthase genes not present in the IA region. Four gene
duplications are seen for both a hypothetical protein as
well as for the Z-lineage genes, a phenomenon not
found in the IA region. There is also haplotypic UCA/
UDA variation while the UEA and UFA genes residing
in the rainbow trout IB region have been lost since
Oncorhynchus and Salmo split, which probably was
around 15-20 mya. The functional consequence of this
evolution remains to be established. Expression profiling, polymorphic content, peptide binding properties
and phylogenetic relationship show that Atlantic salmon
has only one expressed MHC class Ia gene (UBA), in
addition to a multitude of nonclassical loci from the U-,
S and Z-lineages. Further studies are needed to verify
the functional properties of the MHC class Ib molecules
in teleost.

Methods
BAC library screening

An Atlantic salmon CHORI-214 bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library was obtained from BACPAC
Resources, Children’s Hospital Oakland Research Institute [36]. The library consisted of approximately
299,000 recombinant clones, representing 18-fold genome coverage and an average insert size of 188 kb [37].
Putative full length cDNA sequence information for the
S. salar SAA, UHA and ZE genes were obtained from
GRASP EST clustering database [26,27] and used for
primer design. Probes specific for the SAA, UHA and
ZE genes were PCR amplified (primers listed in Table 3)
from a Head Kidney cDNA pool, purified from agarose

Page 13 of 17

gel slices with the GeneClean III Kit (Qbiogene) and
verified by sequencing. Probes were radioactive labelled
with a32P-CTP (Amersham) using Rediprime Random
Labelling Kit (Amersham), including spermine precipitation of labelled DNA. Filter hybridizations were conducted as described by CHORI. Probed BAC library
filters were stored in Phospho-image cassettes for 2-24
hours and hybridizations visualized by a Typhoon Phospho Image Scanner (Amersham).
Characterization of BACs

SAA, UHA and ZE positive BAC clones were ordered
into contigs by GRASP HindIII fingerprint information

from each contig, followed by BAC DNA isolation
described by CHORI. Positive BAC clone DNA from
selected BACs were then PCR amplified with the SAA,
UHA, ZE primers (Table 3) to verify that these BACs
contained sequence of interest.
454 shotgun pyrosequencing

The shotgun sequencing protocol using the 454 sequencing system (454 Life Science, USA) was performed
according to manufactures protocol. Briefly, to generate
the GS FLX shotgun library, the isolated Atlantic salmon
BAC DNA was sheared into fragments, to which process
specific A and B adaptors were blunt end ligated. After
adaptor ligation, the fragments were denatured and clonally amplified via emulsion PCR, thereby generating millions of copies of template per bead. The DNA beads
were then distributed into picolitre-sized wells on a fibreoptic slide (PicoTiterPlate™), along with a mixture of
smaller beads coated with the enzymes required for the
pyrosequencing reaction. The four DNA nucleotides
were then flushed sequentially over the plate. Light signals released upon base incorporation were captured by a
CCD camera, and the sequence of bases incorporated per
well was stored as a read. DNA extractions were performed in our lab, while library generation and sequencing were performed at Royal Institute of Technology,
Dept of Biotechnology (Stockholm, Sweden) and CEES,
University of Oslo (Oslo, Norway). Assembly of the 454
reads were performed with Newbler.
BAC shotgun library and sequencing

The selected BACs were subjected to a shotgun sequencing approach and procedure is described in [13]. After
sequencing run, bases were called using Phred [39,40].
High quality sequencing reads were assembled using
Phrap [41], and viewed and edited using Consed [42].
Autofinish [43] was used for closing gaps by designing
gap-closing primers with subsequent direct sequencing
on BAC DNA or PCR amplification and PCR product
sequencing. The BAC sequences were submitted to
Genbank and given the following accession numbers:
114L13 [Genbank: FJ969488], 184H23 [Genbank:
FJ969489], 439J08 [Genbank: FJ969490], 68O19 [Genbank: GQ505860], 439H13 [Genbank: GQ505859] and
129P21 [Genbank: GQ505858].
Bioinformatics

DIGIT [44] and GENSCAN [45] were used to predict
novel genes and to identify open reading frames. Dotter
[46] was used to compare the BAC sequence to itself as
well as to other BACs and to identify duplicated regions.
Vista was used for sequence comparisons [47]. Blast
searches identified possible functions of predicted genes

Page 14 of 17

[48,49]. Sim4 [50] and Spidey [51] were used to adjust
exon and intron boundaries aligning EST/cDNA
sequences [26,27] to the BAC sequences. GRASP repeatmasker was used to identify repeats [52,53]. Multiple
sequence alignments of the assumed or verified
expressed exons were done using ClustalX [54] followed
by manual inspection. TMHMM Server v. 2.0 was used
for prediction of transmembrane domains for the MHC
class I genes [55-57].
The amino acid sequences were aligned using Clustal
W and inferred by ProTest [58] to find the best-fitting
model of evolution (JTT, with an estimated alpha parameter to 1.827, a gamma distribution of rates between
sites of 4.0 and a proportion of Invariable Sites of 0.012).
Phylogenetic analysis was performed using PhyML 3.0
[59], a fast and accurate maximum likelihood heuristic
method, starting from the BIONJ tree under the parameters estimated by ProtTest. Tree stability was assessed
by means of a bootstrap analysis with 100 cycles. A phylogenetic tree was also created using neighbour-joining
method in MEGA version 4 [60]. Consensus trees were
based on 1000 bootstrap replications and reported with
the bootstrap support values (in percent) indicated above
the respective nodes. Gaps were removed and phylogenetic data reported using the Poisson correction model
with uniform rates across all sites.
Mapping the BACs 114I13 and 184H23 in Atlantic salmon

The sequences of the BACs 114I13 and 184H23 were
screened for suspected and known repetitive elements in
salmonids using a salmonid-specific repeat masker [52].
The resulting sequences were subsequently searched for
the presence of microsatellites using a Perl script created
in Davidson Lab. 21 and 17 microsatellites were identified in 114I13 and 184H23, respectively. Primer3 software [61] was used to design primers that would amplify
the microsatellites containing the largest number of
repeats. Several of these primer pairs were tested on the
parents of the Atlantic salmon SALMAP mapping
families, Br5 and Br6 [62,63], to determine which are
informative. PCR amplifications were carried out in 6 uL
reaction volumes in thin walled tubes using a Biometra
T3 or T3000 Thermocycler. The reaction contained:
20 ng DNA, 1 × PCR buffer, 0.05 mM dNTP, 0.2 μM of
the forward primer, 0.5 μM of the reverse primer, 0.5 μM
of -21M13 primer (5’-TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-3’)
labeled with HEX- or 6-FAM at the 5’ end, and 0.25 U of
Taq polymerase (Qiagen). Touchdown PCR was performed as follows: a 2 min initial denaturation step at 94°
C, then a cycle consisting of a denaturation step of 94°C
for 30 seconds, annealing for 30 seconds and an elongation step at 72°C for 30 seconds. The initial annealing
temperature of 60°C was decreased by 0.5°C every cycle
to 50°C, and then held at 50°C for an additional 14 cycles.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/154

The amplification products were analyzed using an ABI
377 DNA sequencer. The inheritance patterns of two of
these microsatellite markers, Ssa10083BSFU from 114I13
and Ssa10084BSFU from 184H23, were examined in the
SALMAP mapping families. Pair-wise linkage analysis
was performed using the LINKMFEX software package
with a LOD score 4 threshold [64]. Table 3 show the primer sequences of genetic markers used to place 114I13
and 184H23 on the Atlantic salmon linkage map [17].
Gene expression analysis

The study was conducted in agreement with the provision enforced by the National Animal Research Authority (NARA) [65]. mRNA was extracted from Atlantic
salmon tissues of 3 fishes (foregut, hindgut, head kidney,
gills, spleen, liver, eye, tongue, skin, muscle, heart, brain
and blood) using QuickPrep micro mRNA Purification
Kit (GE Healthcare Life Science). 1 μl of mRNA sample
was used for quantification with Nanodrop spectrometer
(Nanodrop Technologies, DE). All samples were DNase
treated using Turbo DNA-free™ (Ambion, Austin, TX,
USA). Gene specific PCR primers (Table 3) were
designed manually for the amplification of approximately 100-150 bp fragments and synthesized by ProOligo (Paris, France). The amplicons were, when possible,
placed over introns and product size and specificity was
confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis (Gel logic 200
Imaging system, Kodak) and sequencing. cDNA synthesis were performed with Ready-To-Go T-Primed First
Strand Kit (Amersham, USA) Quantitative real-time
PCR was conducted on an ABI7700HT (Applied Biosystems, USA). Reactions were performed in 20 μl including 1 μl cDNA (~6 ng of mRNA) using PowerSYBR
Green PCR Master Mix according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Applied Biosystems). PCR parameters were
95°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles consisting of
95°C for 15 s, 60°C at 30 s and 72°C at 60 s. A dissociation analysis was performed for each sample to check
for unspecific amplification. Relative expression of
mRNA in relation to the housekeeping gene elongation
factor 1a (EF1A) was calculated using the ΔCT method
[66]. Data from real-time RT-PCR are presented as the
Mean Relative Expression by calculation of mean 2-ΔCT
× 100 for the three fishes used, with three independent
samples from each tissue from each fish.
