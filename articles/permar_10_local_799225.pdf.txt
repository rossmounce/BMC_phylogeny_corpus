Abstract
Breast milk transmission remains a major mode of infant HIV acquisition, yet anatomic and immunologic forces
shaping virus quasispecies in milk are not well characterized. In this study, phylogenic analysis of envelope
sequences of milk SIV variants revealed groups of nearly identical viruses, indicating local virus production. However, comparison of the patterns and rates of CTL escape of blood and milk virus demonstrated only subtle differences between the compartments. These findings suggest that a substantial fraction of milk viruses are produced
by locally-infected cells, but are shaped by cellular immune pressures similar to that in the blood.
Findings
While transmission via breastfeeding remains a significant mode of infant HIV acquisition, the mechanisms of
this transmission are not well understood. The level of
both cell-free and cell-associated virus in milk have
been linked to the risk of HIV infection of breastfeeding
infants [1-3]. Therefore, viral variants in the milk are a
likely source of transmitted virus.
Recent studies suggest that mucosal compartments are
distinct from systemic compartments in their HIV/SIVspecific immune responses and virus quasispecies [4-8].
The immune response in milk may shape compartmentspecific virus, as seen in other anatomic compartments
such as semen and cervicovaginal fluid [6,9-11]. One
study of the genetic diversity of milk virus suggested a
difference in the dominant virus species in milk and
peripheral blood [4]. A second study subsequently
reported that the predominant virus in blood and milk
were genetically similar, suggesting an equilibrium of
virus between these compartments [12]. Thus, the production site of the virus transmitted via breastfeeding
and the selection pressures that shape its genetic composition are not well understood.

It is well established that HIV/SIV-specific cellular
immune responses are critical for control of systemic
virus replication [13] and progression to AIDS [14].
While HIV/SIV-specific cellular immune responses have
been identified in milk [15,16], the role of these
responses in containing local virus replication is
unknown. Immunodominant cytotoxic T lymphocyte
(CTL) epitopes of SIV and HIV are under significant
cellular immune pressure, leading to distinct mutations
within these epitopes that facilitate virus escape from
CTL recognition. Therefore, the rate at which these
CTL escape mutations occur within a virus population
may be indicative of the magnitude of the cellular
immune pressure in that compartment. However, rates
of CTL escape of mucosal and systemic virus quasispecies have not previously been compared. As the proportion of SIV-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes is two to three
times higher in milk than in blood during acute SIV
infection [15], a faster rate of CTL escape of the milk
virus quasispecies than that in blood would indicate that
this immune response in milk is acting on locally replicating virus.
The SIV-infected rhesus monkey model of HIV pathogenesis is an excellent model in which to study virusspecific immune responses and virus evolution in mucosal compartments, including breast milk [15]. In the present study, we sought to evaluate genetic similarities

between virus quasispecies in blood and milk of chronically SIVmac251-infected rhesus monkeys through phylogenetic comparison of SIV envelope (env) sequences.
We then compared the rate of CTL escape of two
Mamu-A*01-restricted immunodominant epitopes (Tat
TL8 and Gag p11C) in blood and milk virus. Animals
were maintained in accordance with the guidelines of
the “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals”
(National Research Council, National Academic Press,
Washington, D.C., 1996).
Groups of identical or nearly identical viruses in breast
milk of chronically SIV-infected, lactating rhesus monkeys

Cell-free and cell-associated SIV env amplicons were
sequenced from plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMC), breast milk supernatant, and breast milk
cells obtained from 3 chronically SIV-infected, lactating
rhesus monkeys within a 7 day period between 1 and
1.5 years after SIVmac251 infection. SIV env cassettes
containing the env open reading frame were amplified
by single genome amplification (SGA) to reduce the
possibility of PCR-induced recombination during amplification [17]. A nested PCR was performed on end-point
diluted virus cDNA, extracted as previously described
[15], with primers: outer forward (5’ - GAAAGGCTGTAGATGTCTAGG - 3’), outer reverse (5’ - CTCATCTGATACATTTACGGGG - 3’), inner forward (5’ GGGTAGTGGAGGTTCTGGAAG - 3’), inner reverse

(5’ - CCCTACCAAGTCATCATCTTC - 3’) (GenBank
D01065). Total SIV copy numbers measured by quantitative RT-PCR [15] ranged from 6.9 × 103 to 1.5 × 106
copies/ml (3.3 × 103 to 2.2 × 105 total copies measured)
in breast milk and from 5.25 × 105 to 2.1 × 107 copies/
ml (4.7 × 10 4 to 1.8 × 10 6 total copies measured) in
plasma. These total SIV copy numbers were measured
in the animals at the time of collection of the samples
used for sequencing. Sequences were trimmed to the
start codon of ENV and to the 3’ region of env with
unambiguous sequencing for each amplicon within the
same monkey (length: 2397-2559 base pairs) and aligned
using ClustalW version 2 [18]. PhyML version 3.0.1 [19]
was used to infer the evolutionary model parameters
and phylogenetic trees. For each analysis, a GTR+I+G
model (general time reversible model with invariant
sites and gamma-distributed site-to-site rate variation)
was used. Bootstrap support was based on 100 resamplings. Bayesian posterior probabilities were calculated
using MrBayes version 3.1.2 [20] with chains of 2.1 to 3
× 107 iterations and 25% burn in (Fig. 1).
Overall, the range of nucleotide sequence diversity of
cell-free milk virus (monkey 206 = 1.03%, monkey 257 =
0.76%, monkey 403 = 0.75%) was similar to that in the
cell-free blood virus (monkey 206 = 1.1%, monkey 257 =
0.85%, monkey 403 = 0.73%). Strikingly, groups of identical or nearly identical cell-free envs were identified in
milk of all animals, while this was not observed for

sequences are indicated with closed and open squares, respectively, and cell-associated and cell-free milk virus quasispecies env sequences are

plasma-derived cell-free env sequences. These groups of
envs were either identical or differed by a single nucleotide (0 - 0.04% nucleotide difference) and comprised
one-third to three-quarters of the cell-free milk virus
amplified in each animal (monkey 206 = 38.1%, monkey
257 = 76.5%, monkey 402 = 73.3%). Moreover, in animal
402, a single breast milk cell-associated virus variant had
a sequence identical to that of a cluster of cell-free milk
viruses, which suggests that the clonal amplification of
cell-free milk virus variants is produced by a small number of productively-infected, resident cells. In fact, our
findings are consistent with a recent report that actively
replicating virus in breast milk evolves under drug pressure that is distinct from that in the plasma [21]. Thus,
locally-produced virus is likely the major source of virus
present in breast milk.
However, we did not observe phylogenetic evidence of
compartmentalization of blood and milk virus quasispecies, as the blood and milk viral variants were interspersed in the phylogenetic tree of sequences derived
from each monkey. While the milk viruses did not cluster in the phylogenetic trees, all animals exhibited significant compartmentalization between blood and milk
cell-free virus quasispecies as determined by the SlatkinMaddison compartmentalization test of the minimum
possible number of inter-compartment migration events
compared to the distribution of migration events in
1000 randomized trees [22,23] implemented by HYPHY
software [24] (monkey 206: p = 0.001; monkey 402: p =
0.003; monkey 403: p = 0.001). When repeated identical
and nearly identical sequences were removed from the
data set subjected to the Slatkin-Maddison analysis, significant compartmentalization between blood and breast
milk was only evident in animal 206 (monkey 206: p =
0.006; monkey 402: p = 0.795; monkey 403: p = 0.505).
Therefore, whether breast milk and blood represent distinct anatomic compartments for SIV in the setting of
chronic infection remains an open question.

Rate of CTL escape at immunodominant epitopes Tat TL8
and Gag p11C in breast milk virus

As a robust SIV-specific CD8+ T lymphocyte response
occurs in breast milk during acute SIV infection, we
investigated whether CTL escape of two Mamu-A*01restricted immunodominant epitopes Tat TL8 and Gag
p11C occurred at a different rate in milk and blood
virus quasispecies. The Tat TL8 epitope was amplified
by SGA with primers described above (6 to 31 amplicons per compartment). The Gag p11C epitope was
analyzed by SGA with primers: outer forward (5’ GTCTGCGTCATCTGGTGCATTC - 3’), outer reverse
(5’ - TGTTTGTTCTGCTCTTAAGCTTTTGTAG - 3’),
inner forward (5’ - CAAAACAGATAGTGCAGAGACACCTAGTG - 3’), inner reverse (5’ GAAATGGCTCTTTTGGTCCTT - 3’). Virus quasispecies with at least one nonsynonymous mutation within
an immunodominant epitope was defined as a CTL
escape variant. CTL escape at the Tat TL8 epitope
occurs rapidly in the blood so that all virus quasispecies
have a mutated Tat TL8 epitope by day 28 of infection
[25], whereas CTL escape at the Gag p11C epitope
occurs much later due to structural constraints on the
virus at that epitope [26,27].
CTL escape occurred in milk virus at both the Tat
TL8 and Gag p11C epitope with patterns of epitope
position mutations similar to those that occurred in the
blood virus (data not shown). Although there were
subtle differences in the rate of CTL escape of the milk
and blood virus populations, these did not achieve statistical significance. At day 18 after infection, a lower
proportion of virus remained wild type at the Tat TL8
epitope in blood (median = 34.3%; range = 12.5% 90.9%) than in breast milk (median = 67.6%, range =
31% - 100%) of all monkeys (Table 1). However, CTL
escape at the Tat TL8 epitope occurred in all virus variants from both compartments by day 28 after infection
in all monkeys.

We used the Spearman’s rank correlation test to
determine if the proportion of virus variants with CTL
escape of Tat TL8 at day 18 after SIV infection was
associated with the proportion of Tat TL8-specific CD8
+ T lymphocytes or the magnitude of the milk virus
load [15]. The proportion of virus with evidence of CTL
escape in the milk virus population most strongly correlated with the peak milk virus load (R 2 = 0.986, p =
0.083). Therefore, the slightly slower rate of CTL escape
mutation of the Tat TL8 epitope in milk is likely a
result of a lower rate of virus replication in the breast
milk compartment.
As predicted by previous studies of CTL escape at
the Gag p11C epitope, CTL escape at the Gag p11C
epitope occurred at amino acid position 2 during
chronic infection in both blood and milk virus populations (between weeks 17 and 46 after SIV infection)
[27]. Interestingly, CTL escape appears to have
occurred more quickly at Gag p11C in milk than in
blood of 2 of 4 monkeys included in this study. The
majority of the milk virus quasispecies was mutated at
Gag p11C by week 37 in monkey 206 and week 41 in
monkey 257, whereas the majority of blood virus quasispecies remained wild type at Gag p11C until week
45 and 46, respectively (Table 2) We were unable to
detect more rapid CTL escape at the Gag p11C epitope in the milk virus population in one rapid progressor monkey who died less than one year after SIV
inoculation (animal 403) and one monkey that was not
lactating at the time of Gag p11C CTL escape (animal

402). In addition, there was no detectable correlation
between the proportion Gag p11C-specific CD8+ T
lymphocytes or milk virus load and the rate of Gag
p11C CTL escape in milk using nonparametric linear
regression analysis.
In summary, CTL escape of milk virus occurred with a
pattern and rate similar to that seen in blood virus, suggesting that similar cellular immune pressures shape
virus quasispecies evolution in these compartments.
While SIV-specific CD8+ T lymphocyte responses during acute SIV infection appear in milk concurrently with
the reduction of milk virus load from peak [15], we
were not able to demonstrate that the high proportion
of SIV-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes observed in milk
drives earlier CTL escape of milk virus. However, the
small number of evaluated monkeys and restricted sampling schedule make it difficult to demonstrate distinct
rates of CTL escape in blood and milk virus. Although a
limited number of animals were included in this study,
clonal amplification of virus in milk and not in plasma
of all animals studied suggests that replication of breast
milk virus occurs locally.
