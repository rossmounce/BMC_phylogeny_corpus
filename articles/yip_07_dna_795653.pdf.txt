Abstract
As adulterated and substituted Chinese medicinal materials are common in the market, therapeutic
effectiveness of such materials cannot be guaranteed. Identification at species-, strain- and localitylevels, therefore, is required for quality assurance/control of Chinese medicine. This review
provides an informative introduction to DNA methods for authentication of Chinese medicinal
materials. Technical features and examples of the methods based on sequencing, hybridization and
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are described and their suitability for different identification
objectives is discussed.

Background
Chinese medicinal materials have long been used for disease prevention and therapy in China and are becoming
increasingly popular in the West [1-3]. The annual sales of
herbal medicines have amounted to US $7 billion in
Europe and those in the United States increased from US
$200 million in 1988 to more than US $3.3 billion in
1997 [4]. Despite the belief that Chinese medicines are of
natural origin which have few adverse effects, there have
been numerous reports on adverse effects associated with
herbal remedies [5]. One possible cause is the variable
quality of both crude medicinal materials (plants, fungi,
animal parts and minerals) and Chinese proprietary medicines. Many substitutes and adulterants are in the market
due to their lower costs or misidentification caused by
similarity in appearance with their authentic counterparts.
It is particularly difficult to identify those medicines
derived from processed parts of organisms and commercial products in powder and/or tablet forms. Some of the
adulterants or substitutes caused intoxications and even
deaths [6-8]. Moreover, it is also common for several spe-

cies to have the same name [9-12]. Inadvertent substitution of these species can also lead to intoxication [13].
Adulterants and substitutes may have completely different
or weaker pharmacological actions compared with their
authentic counterparts; even different species of the same
genus may have totally different actions. For example,
Panax ginseng (Renshen), considered to be 'hot', is used in
'yang-deficient' conditions, while Panax quinquefolius (Xiyangshen) [14], considered to be 'cool ', is used in 'yin-deficient 'conditions. Authentication of Chinese medicinal
materials is the key to ensure the therapeutic potency,
minimize unfair trade and raise consumers' confidence
towards Chinese medicine in general.
Locality-level identification is also of great importance to
ensure highest therapeutic effectiveness. 'Daodi' is a Chinese term describing the highest quality of herbal materials that are collected from the best region and at the best
time [15]. Chinese medicinal materials cultivated in different localities differ in therapeutic effectiveness. For
example, it is well accepted that Atractylodes macrocephala

(Baizhu) grown in Jiangning, Jiangshu province, China is
more effective than those grown in Zhejiang and Jiangxi
provinces [16]. Condonopsis pilosula (Dangshen) grown in
Shanxi province is generally considered to be more potent
than those grown in other provinces [16]. Furthermore,
samples from the same localities are probably of the same
strains; therefore, origin identification helps select the
best strains of Chinese medicinal materials. There have
been a number of studies investigating medicinal materials grown in different geographical regions. Codonopsis
pilosula (Dangshen) [16], Panax notoginseng (Sanqi) [15],
Bufo bufo gargarizans (Chansu) [17] and Paeonia lactiflora
(Baishao, or Chishao) [18] are just a few examples.
DNA methods for identification of Chinese medicinal
materials
One of the most reliable methods for identification of
Chinese medicinal materials is by analyzing DNA that is
present in all organisms. DNA methods are suitable for
identifying Chinese medicinal materials because genetic
composition is unique for each individual irrespective of
the physical forms of samples, and is less affected by age
[19], physiological conditions, environmental factors [2022], harvest [19], storage and processing [23-31]. DNA
extracted from leaves, stems or roots of a herb all carry the
same genetic information [32]. In general, extracted DNA
is stable and can be stored at -20°C for a long period of
time (about 3–5 years), hence eliminating the time constraint in performing the analysis. A small amount of sample is sufficient for analysis and this is advantageous for
analyzing medicinal materials that are expensive or in
limited supply [32,33].

In terms of the mechanisms involved, DNA methods can
be classified into three types, namely polymerase chain
reaction (PCR)-based, hybridization-based and sequencing-based.
PCR-based method
PCR-based methods use amplification of the region(s) of
interest in the genome; subsequent gel electrophoresis is
performed to size and/or score the amplification products.

PCR-based methods have the advantage of requiring tiny
amounts of samples for analysis due to the high sensitivity
of PCR. However, PCR inhibitors (e.g. polyphenols, pigments and acidic polysaccharides) may be present in DNA
samples, thereby hampering amplification. Moreover,
PCR is prone to contamination because of its high sensitivity [34]. DNA from contaminating bacteria or fungi in
some improperly-stored medicinal samples may be coamplified if the stringency used is not high enough.

PCR-based methods include sequence characterized
amplified regions (SCAR), amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS), simple sequence repeat (SSR) analysis and DNA fingerprinting methods.
DNA fingerprinting
DNA fingerprinting refers to simultaneous analysis of
multiple loci in a genome to produce a unique pattern for
identification. These methods include PCR-restriction
fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), randomprimed PCR (RP-PCR), direct amplification of length polymorphism (DALP), inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR),
amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and
directed amplification of minisatellite-region DNA
(DAMD). Except PCR-RFLP and DAMD, these methods
share the following characteristics:

• Suitable for Chinese medicinal materials which lack
DNA sequence information, as they do not require prior
sequence knowledge
• Large numbers of loci can be screened in a short time
• Require DNA of good quality, in terms of DNA integrity
and the absence of PCR inhibitors
• Unknown origins of the sequences
• Can be used to show the phylogenetic relationships
among organisms within the same genus
PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP)
PCR-RFLP uses endonucleases to digest PCR products of
regions with sequence polymorphisms. By using an endonuclease which recognizes and cleaves at the polymorphic
sites, the digestion of a longer PCR fragment into smaller
fragments will change the banding pattern. PCR-RFLP has
been used for authentication of Panax species [14,35,36],
Fritillaria pallidiflora [37], Atractylodes species [38] and differentiation of Codonopsis from their adulterants [39].

Screening PCR products by using various restriction
enzymes can be an alternative of sequencing to find out
polymorphic regions among samples [34,40]. This
method is more reproducible than random priming methods, but it is limited by the degree of polymorphism
among individuals within a species [25]. The loss of
restriction sites associated with degraded DNA, creation or
deletion of restriction sites due to intra-specific variation
[34], and the presence of enzyme inhibitors may lead to
incomplete digestion.
Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP)
AFLP involves restriction of genomic DNA and ligation to
adapters, selective amplification of restriction fragments

http://www.cmjournal.org/content/2/1/9

using primers containing the adapter sequences and selective bases at the 3' terminals, and subsequent gel analysis
of the amplified fragments [41]. The number of resulting
fragments in this multi-locus approach is determined by
the number and composition of selective nucleotides as
well as the complexity of the genomes. Polymorphisms
detected may be caused by a single nucleotide change at
the restriction site or 3' end of the primer binding site,
insertions and deletions as well as rearrangements. It has
been used for authentication [42] and studying genetic
diversity [43-46] of Chinese medicines.
AFLP combines the advantages of the reliability of RFLP
and the power of PCR. The high reproducibility resulting
from stringent reaction conditions enables the use of polymorphic bands in developing cultivar-specific probes,
which can then be used for easy identification [47]. By
using adapter sequences, fingerprints can be generated
without prior sequence knowledge. The number of amplified fragments can be controlled by changing the restriction enzymes and the number of selective bases and thus
this method is suitable for DNA of any origin and complexity. It is efficient in revealing polymorphisms even
between closely related individuals [48]. The number of
polymorphisms per reaction can be higher than RFLP or
RAPD [47,49]. Three steps and four different primers are
required for analysis of complex genomes [48]. Imperfect
ligation or incomplete restriction of DNA will lead to artifactual polymorphisms because of partial fragments [48].
Moreover, if the sequence homology between two organisms is less than 90%, their fingerprints will share very few
common fragments [50].
Random-primed PCR (RP-PCR)
RP-PCR involves amplification at low annealing temperatures using one or two random primers in each PCR reaction to generate unique fingerprints (Figure 1). At reduced
stringency, the arbitrary primers bind to a number of sites
randomly distributed in the genomic DNA template
although the primer and the template sequences may not
be perfectly matched. Each anonymous and reproducible
fragment is derived from a region of genome that contains, on opposite DNA strands, two primer binding sites
located within an amplifiable distance from each other.
Polymorphisms are resulted from sequence differences
which inhibit primer binding or interfere with amplification. The presence or absence of bands is scored and the
results can be used for calculating genetic distances [5153] and constructing phylogenetic trees [18,54] to study
the relationships among samples.

Techniques based on this concept include arbitrarily
primed PCR (AP-PCR) [55], random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) [56] and DNA amplification fingerprinting (DAF) [57]. AP-PCR employs primers of

approximately 20 nucleotides long and only two relaxed
PCR cycles while RAPD employs primers of 10 nucleotides long and all the PCR cycles are relaxed, and DAF
employs primers of 5–8 nucleotides long and all the PCR
cycles are relaxed with lower stringency than that of
RAPD. AP-PCR results are the most reproducible among
these three methods.
As any part of the genome, including non-coding regions,
may be amplified, these methods can be used to discriminate between closely related individuals. RP-PCR have
been used for marker-assisted selection in breeding [58],
identification at the individual, variety, strain and species
levels [51,59-62], study of genetic diversity [63,64] and
differentiation of cultivated and wild samples [18,65,66].
It has been used to authenticate Chinese medicines
[51,52,67-69] and identify their geographical origins
[16,18,53,70,71].
RP-PCR is a quick and easy method to screen a large
number of loci for DNA polymorphisms in a single PCR.
Polymorphic markers can be generated rapidly without
sequence information. The marker sequences obtained
from RP-PCR can also be used to design specific oligonucleotides to be used in SCAR assay [72]. Moreover, any
single primer can be used, including those for specific PCR
amplification or sequencing. However, there are some
limitations in RP-PCR. Firstly, it is sensitive to the reaction
conditions, including the amounts of templates [73-75]
and magnesium ions [76,77], the sequences of primers
[78-81], the presence of glycerol [82] and the quantity and

quality of the polymerase [83]. Thermocyclers may also
influence the banding patterns due to their different ramp
time from the annealing step to the extension step
[84,85]. Therefore, results generated with different reaction conditions cannot be compared directly. Secondly,
the reproducibility of RP-PCR patterns can be influenced
by the quality, quantity and purity of DNA templates
[86,87]. Some researchers consider this to have a more
significant effect to reproducibility than other factors such
as enzyme quality or buffer conditions which may affect
only the relative intensities of bands, but do not cause a
band to appear or disappear [88]. The number of bands
produced can be greatly increased by adding bovine
serum albumin (BSA), which prevents various contaminants in impure DNA from binding to Taq polymerase
[89] thereby stabilizing the polymerase [90]. This method
is, therefore, unreliable for identification of medicinal
materials with impure or degraded DNA [91] caused by
processing or long storage time. Amplification should be
performed using DNA templates at two concentrations
with at least two-fold difference [92] to ensure reproducibility of the results. Thirdly, as arbitrary primers and low
stringencies are used, DNA from any organisms including
DNA from contaminants can be amplified, thereby contributing to the banding pattern. Fourthly, as different loci
in the genome have different degree of homology among
samples (e.g. coding regions are more conserved), the
number of loci to be included should be large enough to
reveal differences in the whole genome. Fifthly, fragments
of the same size in the fingerprints are not necessarily the
same sequence [93]. It should not be assumed that bands
of a similar size are homologous sequences, especially
when distant species are being examined. The extent of
polymorphism is indicated by the presence and absence
of bands of particular sizes and thus applying RP-PCR on
high taxonomic levels leads to an increase in variance of
genetic distance estimates.
Direct amplification of length polymorphism (DALP)
DALP uses a selective forward primer containing a 5' core
sequence (e.g. M13 universal sequencing primer) plus
additional bases at the 3' end and a common reverse
primer (e.g. M13 reverse primer) to generate multibanded
patterns in denaturing polyacrylamide gel [48]. For identification of fragments having two different ends, two PCR
reactions are performed for each sample, with each reaction containing either of the primers labeled. The common bands in both labeled reactions are the products
having two different ends. Any of these bands can be
excised from the gel and sequenced directly using forward
or reverse primers. After sequencing the polymorphic
bands among the samples, species- or strain-specific primers can be designed. These specific primers can then be
used for mono-locus amplification (i.e. sequence-tagged
site) (Figure 2). DALP is similar to AP-PCR except that it

DALP. DALP employs two separate PCRs, each containing
one of the primers labeled, for each sample. After separation
in denaturing polyacrylamide gel, bands shared by the two
reactions are products with different primers at both ends.
These bands are compared with those of other samples in
order to find the polymorphic bands among the samples. Polymorphic bands can be excised from the gel and sequenced
directly using either of the primers.

uses higher stringency (i.e. higher annealing temperature,
lower concentration of magnesium ion and fewer cycles).
At this stringency, a given arbitrary primer will anneal to
fixed sites across experiments [48]. Moreover, the polymorphic bands can be sequenced directly to further
design species- or strain-specific primers, whereas in APPCR the two ends of the products contain the same primer
sequence. For this reason, AP-PCR products cannot be
sequenced directly (Figure 1). DALP has been used to
detect polymorphisms between species [48,94] and
between strains [48] and to authenticate Panax ginseng
(Renshen) and Panax quinquefolius (Xiyangshen) [95]. It has
also been used in mapping for marker-assisted selection
in breeding [96].
Identification of polymorphic products can be done easily
by searching in public sequence databases. However, each
sample must be subject to two separate PCR reactions by
alternative labeling of the two primers. This requires an
additional step apart from identifying polymorphic bands

among samples. Unlike RP-PCR, much time and effort are
required in screening for suitable primer pairs and optimizing primer ratio [97].
Inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSR)
ISSR [98] employs a primer containing simple repeat
sequences for PCR amplification to generate fingerprints
(Figure 3). The primer can be 5' or 3' anchored by selective
nucleotides to prevent internal priming of the primer and
to amplify only a subset of the targeted inter-repeat
regions, thereby reducing the number of bands produced
by priming of dinucleotide inter-repeat region [98-100].
Therefore regions between inversely oriented closely
spaced microsatellites are amplified [101]. This method
relies on the existence of 'SSR hot spots' in genomes
[98,101]. It has been used in the authentication of Dendrobium officinale (Tiepi Shihu) [102] and in the studies of
genetic variations and relationships [103-106].

As simple sequence repeats exist in any genome, this
method allows fingerprints to be generated for any organism. However, the primers may anneal to sequences other
than microsatellites of the desired repeats as in RAPD
[99]. Moreover, the banding patterns can be affected by
magnesium ion concentration, thermocycler and annealing temperature in use [102]. Compared to SSR markers,
ISSR markers are not locus-specific and anonymous bands
are produced in the fingerprints [101].
Directed amplification of minisatellite-region DNA (DAMD)
Minisatellites are also known as variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR). They are similar to microsatellites
except that the repeat unit sequence is longer than 10 bp
(the distinction between microsatellites and minisatellites
is often arbitrary with repeat units between 8 and 15 bp
[107]). DAMD [108] is a DNA fingerprinting method

http://www.cmjournal.org/content/2/1/9

based on amplification of the regions rich in minisatellites at relatively high stringencies by using previously
found VNTR core sequences as primers (Figure 1). It is
employed in identification of species-specific sequences
[109]. The method has been used for authentication of
Panax ginseng (Renshen) and Panax quinquefolius (Xiyangshen) [42] and characterization of varieties [78] and cell
lines
[110].
Similar to SSR, minisatellites are present in all organisms,
making it possible to apply this method to any genome.
Examples include plants such as mulberry [78] and
oilseed [109], mushrooms Agaricus bisporus and Pleurotus
[111], animals such as human, snake and mouse [110],
insects such as mosquito and moth. This method is more
reproducible than RAPD due to the longer primers used
[111]. However, similar to ISSR, it only reveals polymorphisms in the regions rich in repetitive sequences, while
RP-PCR can represent the polymorphisms of the whole
genome [78]. Moreover, polymorphic sequence must be
obtained by cloning polymorphic bands prior to sequencing because of the same primer sequences at both ends of
the PCR product.
Sequence characterized amplified regions (SCAR)
SCAR [72] can be used for detection or differentiation of
samples by using specific primers designed from polymorphic RAPD [72,112] or ISSR [113,114] fragments for PCR,
leading to positive or negative amplification in target-containing and non-target-containing samples respectively
[112,115] or amplification products of different sizes in
the case of closely related samples [91,116]. This method
has been used for authentication of Panax [91] and crocodilian species [115], and for discrimination of Artemisia
princeps (Kuihao) and Artemisia argyi (Aiye) from other
Artemisia herbs [112].

SCAR markers are more reproducible than RAPD markers,
and they are straightforward for data interpretation. As little DNA is required for PCR, DNA extraction must be performed on a sample representative of the mix in order to
accurately detect a target in a mixture. Prior sequence
information (i.e. sequencing the polymorphic fragments)
is required for designing the primers flanking the polymorphic region. As PCR inhibitory effects of ingredients
in Chinese medicine can lead to false negative results,
amplification of a control fragment using the same DNA
template [114,115] or spiking control DNA amplifiable
by the same primers to the sample DNA should be performed to ensure that the quality of sample DNA is suitable for PCR.
Amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS)
ARMS [117] is also known as allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR)
[118]. It refers to PCR amplification using primers which
differ in the 3' terminal for distinguishing related samples.
This method is based on the fact that mismatches at the
last base(s) at the 3' terminal of primers can lead to failure
in PCR [119,120]. It has been used to identify Panax species [121] and Curcuma (Ezhu) species [122] using primers
based on chloroplast trnK and nuclear 18S rRNA genes.
ARMS based on mitochondrial cytochrome b gene has been
used for detection of tiger bone DNA [123]. It has also
been used for distinguishing Myospalax baileyi [124] and
gecko [125] from their substitutes and adulterants.

This method is simple, rapid and reliable [117]. However,
as the absence of bands is also considered as a positive
result for detection experiments, appropriate positive controls should be included to show that the reagents have
indeed worked properly and that the PCR process was not
problematic. PCR inhibitory effects leading to false negative results can be identified by parallel testing of samples
spiked with tiny quantities of pure target DNA to demonstrate the level of detection [123].
Simple sequence repeats (SSR) analysis
SSR analysis is also referred to as simple sequence length
polymorphism (SSLP). SSR [126,127] is also known as
microsatellites, short tandem repeats and sequence-tagged
microsatellite sites (STMS) which are short tandem
repeats of 2–8 nucleotides [128,129] or 1–6 nucleotides
[130-132] widely and abundantly dispersed in most
nuclear eukaryotic genomes [130,133,134]. Changes in
repeat numbers at SSR loci are much more frequent than
normal mutation rate [101,135,136] because of slippage
[133,136-138] and recombination [133,138-140]. The
different numbers of repeating units (alleles) in polymorphic loci lead to variation in band sizes (length polymorphism) when specific flanking primers designed based on
conserved sequences are used for amplification of the loci
in organisms of the same species. The presence or absence

http://www.cmjournal.org/content/2/1/9

of each allele at each locus can be scored digitally. Figure
3 shows the procedural differences between ISSR and SSR.
SSR analysis has been applied in authentication of ginseng [25,141]. In SSR analysis, Panax quinquefolius (Xiyangshen) showed different allele patterns compared with
those of Panax ginseng (Renshen). Moreover, cultivated
and wild Panax quinquefolius (Xiyangshen) can be distinguished from each other [141]. This method has also been
used in characterization of germplasm resource of Gastrodia elata (Tianma) [142] and studying genomic variation
in regenerants of Codonopsis lanceolata (Dangshen) [104].
Due to its ability for analysis at low taxonomic levels, it
has been applied to breeding programs [143].
SSR loci are highly polymorphic [101,144]. In bread
wheat, loci with 4 to 40 alleles have been found for 480
varieties [145], with an average of 16.4 alleles. It is possible to multiplex 17 loci in a single PCR reaction [146]. As
the primers are designed according to conserved
sequences, they may be successfully applied for related
species [147,148] and sometimes across genera
[147,149]. Moreover, the primers can be accessible to
other laboratories via published primer sequences [150152]. Besides the advantages of employing PCR and the
high reproducibility, this technique can be fully automated (including automated sizing of PCR products by
fluorescence-based detection) and fitted into large-scale,
high throughput authentication centers [25].
Size differences can also be caused by insertions and deletions, and duplication events in the flanking sequences
[153-155]. However, high initial investment and technical expertise are required for development of SSR markers
[156-158]. Although SSR markers can be identified by
screening DNA [150,159,160] or EST sequence databases
[161-163], sequence information is not available for most
Chinese medicinal species. Without sequence information, SSR marker development involves either constructing enriched genomic libraries [142,147,149,164], ISSR
genomic pools [165,166] or Southern hybridizationscreened RAPD genomic pools [167,168] followed by
cloning and sequencing. However, the identified loci may
not be polymorphic or informative [169]. Moreover, null
alleles (i.e. loss of PCR products occurring due to mutations in the primer binding sites) may be encountered
[143,150,158] even when using SSR markers developed
from the same species [170].
Sequencing-based methods
Much information can be obtained from DNA sequences
[34]. DNA sequences can be used for studying phylogenetic relationships among different species [70,171,172].
Sequencing also allows detection of new or unusual species [34,173]. Another advantage of using sequencing for

http://www.cmjournal.org/content/2/1/9

species identification is that the identities of adulterants
can be identified by performing sequence searches on
public sequence databases such as GenBank. By database
searching, Mihalov et al. [174] successfully identified soybean substituted for ginseng (Panax species) in commercial samples. However, prior sequence knowledge is
required for designing primers for amplification of the
region of interest [34].
DNA sequencing can be used to assess variations due to
transversions, transitions, insertions or deletions. Different regions in the genome evolve at different rates, which
are useful for identification at different taxonomic levels
[33]. Regions that do not code for proteins are under
lower selective pressure and thus can be more variable.
The more variable is a particular region, the more closely
related individuals can be differentiated by this region.
Regions commonly used include rRNA genes, mitochondrial genes and chloroplast genes [175]. There are more
than 100 copies of these genes in a cell, which evolve
inter-dependently (i.e. concerted evolution [176-178],
previously known as horizontal evolution [179] in the
case of rRNA genes, and homoplasmy [180,181] in the
cases of mitochondrial and chloroplast genes). Thus,
methods using these regions are highly sensitive and
amplifications are facilitated. This is also advantageous
during PCR amplification of medicinal samples with
degraded DNA because the presence of one full-length
copy in a reaction is theoretically enough for amplification. Moreover, the conserved sequences flanking the
genes are useful for designing 'universal' primers to be
used for amplifying and sequencing the genes from many
species [182-185].
rDNA sequences have been used for studying Chinese
medicines such as Panax species [35,186-188], Eucommia
ulmoides (Duzhong) [189], Cordyceps (Dongchongxiacao)
species [190], Dendrobium (Shihu) species [191],
Myospalax baileyi [192] and Ligusticum chuanxiong
(Chuanxiong) [193]. The chloroplast sequences have been
used for studying Curcuma (Ezhu) species [194], Panax
notoginseng (Sanqi) [67,188], Adenophora (Shashen) species
[195] and Atractylodes (Cangzhu) species [38]. The mitochondrial sequences have been used for studying Bungarus
parvus [196], Hippocampus species [197] and turtle shells
[198].
Hybridization-based methods
Nucleic acid hybridization is a process in which two complementary single-stranded nucleic acids anneal into a
double-stranded nucleic acid through the formation of
hydrogen bonds. DNA hybridization has been used for
detection of Dendrobium (Shihu) species by incorporating
a species-specific region of reference samples on a glass
slide and subsequent hybridization of the region ampli-

methods for (a) species and (b) locality/strain levels.
a) For species level, SCAR and ARMS are suitable for detection of a target species or differentiation of species within the
same genus. Microarray hybridization is suitable for detection
of species within a list of suspected ones. Sequencing of species-specific regions is suitable for identification of samples
with its species totally unknown. b) For locality or strain
level, species identification should be performed first. Then,
depending on whether prior sequence knowledge is available
and the integrity of the DNA samples, different methods can
be applied. SSR analysis and sequencing of strain-specific
sequences are suitable for samples with primer sequences
already available and SSR analysis is especially suitable for
samples with DNA of low integrity. For samples without
prior sequence knowledge, SSR marker development followed by subsequent SSR analysis can be applied for DNA
samples of low integrity, while AFLP, RP-PCR, ISSR, DALP
and DAMD can be applied for DNA samples of high integrity.

[200], it has also been used to identify Fritillaria (Chuanbeimu) species [201] and toxic Chinese medicinal materi-

Ref

The polymorphisms in the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 sequence among the samples
can be shown using various restriction enzymes to create species-specific
RFLP profiles. Ten per cent of contamination of P. ginseng was detected
from P. quinquefolius sample.
Based on the 18S rRNA gene, three Panax species gave species-specific
electrophoretic profiles by PCR-RFLP and expected fragments
corresponding to each species were detected only under defined
conditions by mutant allele specific amplification (MASA, i.e. ARMS)
analyses.
A ginseng sample showed fragments distinctive from the other two
samples of the same country but different locality origins.

Polymorphic bands unique to P. ginseng and to P. quinquefolius and bands
common to them were identified. P. ginseng samples from different farms
in China and Korea are homogeneous genetically. P. quinquefolius from
different sources are much more heterogeneous.
Similarity among the DNA of ginseng plants analyzed was low.

A 725 bp band was present in the elite strain Aizu K-111 (now called
Kaishusan) while the other strains did not always show this band.
Cluster analysis of the patterns showed that the genetic relationship
between different strains of Da-maya group is closer than those strains of
E-maya group.
Fingerprints for P. ginseng or P. quinquefolius were basically consistent
irrespective of plant source or age compared to the very different
fingerprints from adulterants. The degree of similarity of the fingerprints
confirmed that P. ginseng is more closely related to P. quinquefolius than it is
to P. notoginseng.
Oriental ginseng from two sources produced nearly identical fingerprints.
Two American ginseng samples gave fingerprints distinctive to the species
with two primers tested but polymorphic and significantly different
fingerprints with one of the primers tested. Therefore, the American
ginseng samples were supposed to be from different strains.
A DALP fragment was found present in all P. ginsengs but absent in all the
P. quinquefolius examined. The species-specific band was converted to
sequence-tagged site (i.e. amplification by specific primers giving a speciesspecific band) for quick authentication.
A polymorphic AFLP band in P. ginseng contains a minisatellite which can
be used in DAMD analysis to authenticate the two tested ginsengs.
There is a 25 bp insertion in P. ginseng for a polymorphic RAPD fragment.
By using primers designed based on this polymorphic fragment, P.
quinquefolius and P. ginseng can be differentiated. Amplification on four
other Panax species and two ginseng adulterants gave markedly different
products.
Five sets of species-specific primers with two pairs in each set were
designed. Two expected fragments, one from trnK gene and another from
18S rRNA gene, were observed simultaneously only when the set of
species-specific primers encountered template DNA of the corresponding
species.
Using nine of the 16 screened loci, Chinese ginseng was differentiated
unambiguously from the American samples. Some of the informative loci
showed different allelic patterns among ginsengs from different farms.
American ginseng had a different allele pattern (allele frequency in an
American ginseng population of 34 cultivated and 21 wild ginseng) in two
microsatellite loci compared with that of the Oriental ginseng (six from
China and South Korea). Cultivated and wild American ginseng were
distinguished.
The sequences of the 18S rRNA region of 3 Panax species have different
base substitutions at four nucleotide positions. By the polymorphism, the
ginseng species from commercial samples were identified.
The sequences of the ITS and 5.8S coding region were used to reconstruct
the phylogenetic relationships among twelve Panax species. P. quinquefolius
was suggested to be more closely related to the eastern Asian species
than P. trifolius. Previous suggestions about monophyly of P. ginseng, P.
notoginseng and P. quinquefolius were not supported by the ITS data.
Several biogeographical implications were inferred from the results.

The nuclear 18S rRNA and chloroplast matK genes of 18 samples of Panax
notoginseng and its processed material Sanqi (Radix Notoginseng) were
found to be identical regardless of cultivar origin. Thus the same strain
should be used in cultivation for conservation of the species.
Notoginseng and its adulterants were differentiated on the basis of their
sequence variation in the nuclear ribosomal RNA small subunit (18S
rRNA) and chloroplast matK gene.

The nuclear ITS and chloroplast rbcL regions were amplified using
universal primers and then sequenced using nested ginseng-specific
primers. All the samples including five root samples, thirteen powder
samples and six capsule samples were identified as American or Korean
ginseng except a capsule and a tablet that were identified as soybean, by
using the universal primers for sequencing. They could not be sequenced
by the nested primers.

The results obtained from Panax do not represent Chinese medicines. The results of specific techniques depend on their conditions (e.g. primers and
magnesium concentration).

als such as Datura (Yangjinhua) species [202,203], Pinellia
(Banxia) species [33,202] and others[202,204].
With DNA hybridization, detection from a variety of possible species is feasible [204]. Detection of the presence of
multiple species in admixtures [205,206] and in a wide
range of commercially processed, heated and canned food
products have also been demonstrated [206-208]. Moreover, DNA hybridization has been used to identify organisms of different breeds [209]. If the probes are
oligonucleotides shorter than 100 bases, hybridization is
possible even after a considerable level of DNA degradation [34]. However, a relatively large amount of DNA is
required and the process is time-consuming (because the
hybridization step typically requires overnight incubation) [34] and labor-intensive compared to PCR-based
methods. If the experimental conditions are not stringent
enough, cross-hybridization with highly similar but not
identical targets may also occur [204,210,211], resulting
in false-positive results. Furthermore, only a limited
number of probes can be applied in one hybridization
experiment [212,213] for most hybridization methods. As
a result, much time has to be spent on testing a large
number of probes and checking for false-positives and
false-negatives. Despite the fact that microarray hybridization has a high throughput, it is still quite expensive.
Comparison of methods
Level of identification
The level of identification by a certain method largely
depends on its targeted region in the genome and its
mechanism and principle of analysis. Species-specific
regions, such as internal transcribed spacers (ITS) and 5S
rRNA spacer regions of ribosomal DNA, mitochondrial
cytochrome b and chloroplast trnL-trnF spacer regions, have
been used for species-level identification by sequencing

[53,70,174], microarray hybridization [199,204] and PCR
[123]. SCAR, in which the species-specific bands generated from fingerprints are used for primer construction
[91,112], is applicable to species-level identification.
However, techniques based on differences of several
bases, such as ARMS and PCR-RFLP, can be applied to species-level identification or lower even when more conserved genes are employed, as long as sufficient
polymorphic nucleotides can be found in the genes. For
example, 18S ribosomal gene has been used for PCR-RFLP
for differentiation of Panax ginseng (Renshen) from 4 localities [36]. The chloroplast trnK gene and the nuclear 18S
rRNA gene have been used for ARMS to identify Panax
species [121] and Curcuma (Ezhu) species [122].
Except for PCR-RFLP, fingerprinting methods can only be
used to discriminate among closely related individuals,
mostly on population [214,215], strain and locality
[36,53,59,62] levels. However, if scoring of bands for further processing is not required, fingerprinting methods
can be applied in differentiation at the species level
[51,60] by banding pattern comparison with reference
materials.
SSR analysis can be used in identification of species within
the same genus [25,141], at the variety and cultivar level
[143,145,216] as well as at the individual level [217,218].
It is not used for comparing species of different genus
because the sequences of the amplification products can
be quite different even if the primers can successfully
amplify PCR products [153,219]. ISSR involves amplification of regions between SSR loci and can be used for
authentication at population [102,220,221] and species
levels [222,223].

Figure 5
Comparison of various regions for use on various taxonomic levels (adapted from [244-246])
Comparison of various regions for use on various taxonomic levels (adapted from [244-246]). The thickness of
the lines represents how frequently the regions are used for identification at the levels. The exact taxonomic levels that the
regions can be applied to depend on the selected method. Successful application on a species does not guarantee successful
application on other species at the same taxonomic level. For nuclear DNA regions, 18S and 5.8S regions are usually used for
identification to the order or family levels and 26S is usually used for the order level down to the species level. The two ITS
regions and the 5S spacer region are commonly used for identification at the species level, but they can also be applied down
to the population/strain/variety level. For chloroplast DNA regions, 16S is suitable for the order level, while rbcL, atpβ and ndhF
are suitable for the levels from order to species. The trnL intron, trnL-trnF spacer and matK regions can be applied to the levels
from order to population/strain/variety, but the former two are more commonly used for the levels from family to species,
while the latter is commonly used for the levels from order to subspecies. The atpβ-rbcL region can be used for the levels from
genus to population/strain/variety, but it is more commonly used for the levels from genus to subspecies. For mitochondrial
regions, cytochrome b and the control region can be used for identification at the levels from species to population/strain/variety, but the former is more commonly used for the species level and the latter is more commonly used for the subspecies level
and lower.
Choice of method
Table 1 summarizes the methods mentioned in this article. Each method has its own advantages and limitations.
Decisions as to which method to use should be based on
the aim, the DNA quality of the obtained sample and the
cost of implementation (e.g. whether prior sequence
knowledge is obtainable and required). A diagram showing the technical considerations affecting the choice of
method is provided in Figure 4. Besides method selection,
choosing a suitable DNA region for analysis is also crucial

in obtaining good results (Figure 5). It should be noted
that the exact taxonomic levels the regions can be applied
to depend on the choice of method, and that successful
application on a species does not guarantee successful
application on other species at the same taxonomic level.
Problems faced for using DNA in identification
While DNA methods are excellent for identifying Chinese
medicinal materials of various forms, certain problems
remain to be solved. DNA degradation is common for

Page 11 of 19

Chinese Medicine 2007, 2:9

those materials that have been heat-treated [123,224-226]
by frying, sun-drying, oven-drying or milling without
cooling, treated with various chemicals and stored for a
long time in various conditions. This problem may be
overcome by choosing more degradation-tolerant methods, one of which is employing multi-copy genes (e.g.
ribosomal and mitochondrial genes) [227] so that the
chances of getting some full-length copies are higher. The
mitochondrial genes are also suitable because mitochondria are relatively intact during processing [228]. Another
approach is to analyze small regions of DNA by methods
such as SSR analysis [229,230], which may target
sequences as short as several tens of base pairs of DNA and
the chances of breakage within the target region are minimal [231-233]. Hybridization is also useful in identification of degraded DNA [206,207].
The presence of PCR inhibitors is a problem. Chinese
medicinal materials are usually (1) plants that may contain phenolic compounds, acidic polysaccharides and pigments, (2) fungi which may contain acidic
polysaccharides and pigments, or (3) animal remains
which may contain fat and complex polysaccharides.
Choosing the most suitable DNA extraction procedures
for the types of samples may help eliminate the PCR
inhibitors [234-237]. Other possible solutions are diluting the extracted DNA and adding PCR enhancers.

authentication of Chinese medicinal materials can be
solved.

Conclusion
Authentication of Chinese medicinal materials is important for ensuring safe and appropriate use of Chinese
medicines, ensuring the therapeutic effectiveness, minimizing unfair trade and raising consumers' confidence
towards Chinese medicines. It also plays an important
role in the modernization, industrialization and internationalization of Chinese medicine. DNA methods are reliable approaches towards authentication of Chinese
medicinal materials. While their abilities in identification
at various levels (e.g. species, strain and locality levels)
may vary, they are used in identification of samples in any
physical forms and provide consistent results irrespective
of age, tissue origin, physiological conditions, environmental factors, harvest, storage and processing methods
of the samples. The low requirement of sample quantity
for analysis is of particular importance for quality control
of premium medicinal materials and for detecting contaminants. For future development, it is necessary to compile a reference library of Chinese medicines with genetic
information, especially for endangered species and those
with high market value and/or with possible poisonous
adulterants
[243].

Abbreviations
Contamination by non-target DNA of bacteria, fungi or
insects due to improper storage or by other medicinal
materials in formulations is another challenge. This creates the biggest problem for fingerprinting methods
because the DNA of the contaminants will be amplified.
This may be overcome by using methods specific for the
target such as ARMS and SCAR. If the region of analysis is
species-specific and the stringency is high enough, microarray analysis is also an alternative for studying DNA mixtures [199,238]. However, DNA degradation by microbes
cannot be avoided in contaminated samples [239].

5S spacer 5S rRNA gene spacer

DNA information is not directly correlated with the
amounts of active ingredients. However, genetic data have
its own advantages (as discussed above) over other methods for authentication and identification.

AS-PCR allele-specific PCR

There are successful cases of using DNA methods to identify Chinese medicines, such as Panax [174,186,240]
(Table 2), crocodilian species [115] and Dendrobium
(Shihu) species [200,241] in commercial products. DNA
methods can also be used to identify components in concentrated Chinese medicine preparations in which the
components have been grounded, boiled, filtrated, concentrated, dried and blended [242]. By applying appropriate methods and regions of genome, problems in
