Abstract
Background: The variable region-containing chitin-binding proteins (VCBPs) are found in
protochordates and consist of two tandem immunoglobulin variable (V)-type domains and a chitinbinding domain. We previously have shown that these polymorphic genes, which primarily are
expressed in the gut, exhibit characteristics of immune genes. In this report, we describe VCBP
genomic organization and characterize adjacent and intervening genetic features which may
influence both their polymorphism and complex transcriptional repertoire.
Results: VCBP genes 1, 2, 4, and 5 are encoded in a single contiguous gene-rich chromosomal
region and VCBP3 is encoded in a separate locus. The VCBPs exhibit extensive haplotype variation,
including copy number variation (CNV), indel polymorphism and a markedly elevated variation in
repeat type and density. In at least one haplotype, inverted repeats occur more frequently than
elsewhere in the genome. Multi-animal cDNA screening, as well as transcriptional profilingusing a
novel transfection system, suggests that haplotype-specific transcriptional variants may contribute
to VCBP genetic diversity.
Conclusion: The availability of the Branchiostoma floridae genome (Joint Genome Institute, Brafl1),
along with BAC and PAC screening and sequencing described here, reveal that the relatively limited
number of VCBP genes present in the amphioxus genome exhibit exceptionally high haplotype
variation. These VCBP haplotypes contribute a diverse pool of allelic variants, which includes gene
copy number variation, pseudogenes, and other polymorphisms, while contributing secondary
effects on gene transcription as well.

Background
The variable region-containing chitin-binding proteins
(VCBPs), that have been identified in protochordates, represent a phylogenetically ancient example of a highly
diversified family of immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF)
variable (V)-type encoding immune-type genes [1,2]. Several features of VCBPs, including the presence of two VLIKE DOMAINS [3], distribution into characteristic subgroups, specific expression in the gut and focal regions of
sequence hypervariation, are consistent with a role in
immune-type recognition [4]. Hypervariation in VCBPs
was described initially as a population phenomenon in
which each additional study animal was observed to possess at least one allele not observed previously [2]. The
extraordinarily high degree of sequence polymorphism in
VCBPs is consistent with a considerable repertoire of recognition specificities [2]. Certain other features of VCBPs,
including the position of the hypervariable regions, which
are displaced relative to the V-DOMAINS of immunoglobulins (Ig) and T-cell receptors (TCR), as well as the apparent lack of a contiguous J region, are seemingly
inconsistent with basic features of Ig and TCRs [3,5-7].
The solved structure of a VCBP reveals that the regions of
sequence hypervariation map to a contiguous surface that
is distinct from those involved in conventional antigen
binding, recognition of viral proteins or binding of superantigens by mammalian Ig or TCR [8]. Furthermore, the
structural analysis indicates that a structure emulating a J
region is present. In this manuscript, sequencing and
detailed annotation of the VCBP gene loci has been carried out and interpreted within the context of the first
draft of the amphioxus genome (Joint Genome Institute,
Brafl1). The results define the haplotypic complexity of
VCBPs and identify several features of proximal chromosomal regions that could potentially relate to the high
level of sequence polymorphism associated with this multigene family.

Results
Screening of a genome library with VCBP probes
In order to eliminate assembly artifacts as well as other
inconsistencies noted on inspection of Brafl1 and to
achieve the level of refinement required for unequivocal
assignment of haplotypic variation in VCBP loci, specific
reference genome BAC clones were sequenced (Table 1
and Additional file 1: Table S1 and Table S2) and assembled. The reference genome BAC sperm library was
screened using probes specific for VCBPs 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
subgroups [1]. Additional VCBP genes and alleles were
recovered from a multi-animal PAC library (see Additional file 1: Table S1 and Table S2). VCBP2 and VCBP5,
closely related subgroup genes, are more distantly related
to VCBPs 1, 3, or 4 but share the same domain structure.
VCBP5 consists of an N-terminal [D1] V domain of the
VCBP2-type but possesses a distinct (VCBP5-type) C-ter-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/9/78

minal [D2] V domain and a [D3] chitin binding domain
(CBD) [1]. Probes specific for VCBP2 and VCBP5 cohybridize consistently, indicating close physical linkage
(Fig. 1 and Additional file 2). Probes specific for VCBP1
and VCBP4 co-hybridized in some but not all BACs; other
BAC clones hybridize only with VCBP1 probes and are not
linked to BACs encoding VCBPs 1 and 4 (Fig. 1). VCBP3specific probes did not hybridize to VCBPs 1, 2, 4 or 5containing BACs.
VCBP2/5 cluster
The VCBP2/5 locus is of particular interest owing to the
complex polymorphism reported for these genes [2] (see
Additional file 1: Table S3 and Table S4). Conventional
sequencing, restriction fragment hybridization patterns
and directed PCR approaches indicate that BAC 63n5 and
BAC 43b24 define an ~315 kb contig to which BAC 62d19
is allelic across the VCBP2/5 cluster, defining the first two
haplotypes, A and B (Fig. 1 and Additional files 2, 3, 4).
The typical organization of the VCBP2/5 cluster in the
genome reference animal comprises one VCBP2 flanked
by a pair of paralogous VCBP5 genes, referred to hereafter
as genes 5a, 2b, and 5b, respectively (Fig. 1), and share
similar exon/intron organization (Fig. 2 and Additional
file 1: Table S1). This designation differentiates the first
and second VCBP5 genes, which differ markedly. The
VCBP2/5 gene clusters from the BACs exhibit marked haplotypic variation that extends to include miscellaneous,
unrelated coding regions (see Additional files 2, 3, 4).
Based on haplotypes A-C, the VCBP2/5 cluster ranges in
size from 25–40 kb and exhibits inter- and intragenic variation. Large indels that include the presence/absence
and/or the expansion/shrinkage of repeats and fragments
of mobile elements are evident (Fig. 3 and Additional files
2, 3, 4).

This assembly is inconsistent with Brafl1 that predicts two
VCBP5 pseudogenes (consisting of missing or disrupted
exons), both flanking an intact VCBP2 gene. The repetitive
nature of some segments of the VCBP2/5 genetic region,
which includes three large flanking repeat regions (see
Additional files 2, 3, 4), likely confounded the correct
assembly, as reported for other genomes [9]. An additional open reading frame (ORF) encoding a VCBP5-type
CBD is positioned 100 kb distal to the VCBP2/5 cluster,
immediately adjacent to the middle repeat in BAC contig
63n5-43b24 (see Additional file 2). BAC contig 63n543b24, which represent the allelic counterpart to
scaffold_295 across the VCBP2/5 gene cluster, can be
assigned to scaffold_82 (2.39 mb), which spans ~100 kb
of scaffold_295, extending it 2.1 mb downstream (Fig. 1
and Additional file 4).
PAC 37d15, recovered from a pooled animal library, was
used to characterize a third VCBP2/5 cluster defining a

Genomic organization of VCBP1, 2, 4, 5 and VCBP3
Genomic organization of VCBP1, 2, 4, 5 and VCBP3. A. Overlapping scaffolds_295 and 82 represent VCBP haplotypes
B and A, respectively; assemblies are based on Brafl1, which was corrected from sequencing of BAC clones 62d19, 63n5-43b24
and 100J9. Information also derives from sequencing of additional BACs and PACs. VCBP1/4 is represented by a pair of artifactual gene duplicates on scaffold_295. BAC 100j9 possesses the second set of VCBP1/4 gene pairs (see Additional files 5 and 6)
incorrectly assembled onto scaffold_295; correct assignment is scaffold_869 (haplotype A) (dotted arrow; authors note:
assembly correction). The first set of VCBP1/4 genes on scaffold_295 is supported by direct PCR and limited DNA sequencing
from BAC 5h9 (data not shown). The contiguous genetic region defined by haplotypes A (scaffold_82) and B (scaffold_295)
spans ~1.5 Mb. PAC 37d15 (independent animal) represents haplotype C and possesses a VCBP2 CNV (VCBP 2a*); PAC
34i17, not shown, represents a unique VCBP1/4 haplotype. Shaded box (labeled YR) represents a Ngaro-like tyrosine recombinase retroposon gene (see text). Pseudogenes (Y) are indicated while intergeneic distances are in kb (1,000 base pairs) but
not to scale. Transcriptional orientation is indicated by directionality of gene boxes; a and b designations reflect paralogous
relationships. B. VCBP3 is located on scaffold_1; an independent PAC allele (see Additional files 7 and 10) exhibits allelic variation. Screening of the BAC library revealed two VCBP3 alleles localized to BACs 90f15 and 54h3 (see Additional file 8). CHEF
analyses (not shown) and extensive BAC library screening are inconsistent with linkage between the VCBP1/4 and 2/5 clusters
and the VCBP3 gene.

new haplotype (haplotype C). Accurate assembly of this
sequence required restriction fragment mapping,
sequencing of PCR-generated fragments and deletion subcloning. Three (99% identical) copies of an ~4.3 kb repeat
with open reading frames related to non-LTR LINE-like
elements are encoded within three introns of the VCBP
genes, in which a portion of an additional (upstream)
VCBP2 paralog also was identified (Additional file 1:
Table S1). The 37d15 haplotype arrangement is likely
VCBP 2a, 5a, 2b, 5b. Although an orthologous allele of
this additional VCBP2 gene (i.e., a four gene haplotype) is
not present in the genome reference animal, additional
copies of VCBP2 or VCBP5 genes have been noted in large

scale screenings of additional animals (L. Dishaw, unpublished) and likely represent VCBP2/5 copy number variants (CNVs).
VCBP1 and 4 genes
BAC 100j9 (VCBP1+/4+) encodes single VCBP1 and
VCBP4 genes in opposing transcriptional orientation (Fig.
1). One set of VCBP1/4 genes was defined in the reference
genome based on: restriction mapping, directed PCR,
additional DNA sequencing of an ~4–8 kb sub-library and
dot plot pairwise comparisons (Fig. 1 and Additional files
5 and 6). Restriction mapping and light sequencing of
PAC 34i17 and several other VCBP1 and VCBP4 positive

Haplotypes and gene naming are consistent with Figure 1, where a, b, c, etc. are paralogous VCBP genes. In the absence of known genetic linkage,
haplotypic assignment of VCBP3 alleles is not clear, relative to the other VCBPs, see Figure 1. Haplotype X is an independent animal from the same
multi-animal library from which haplotype C was acquired, yet no relationship between the haplotypes is discernable. Accession numbers and
downloadable sequences are available in Additional file 1. Note1 BAC support was not pursued for VCBP1b and VCBP1c. Note2 VCBP1d is a five
exon pseudogene. BAC support was not pursued; a VCBP5-like pseudogene consisting of only the CBD exon is also present on haplotype A and B
but not listed here, see Additional file 1.

BACs (alternative alleles) are consistent with allelic variation across the VCBP1/4 locus (Additional file 1: Table
S1). In addition to the tightly linked VCBP1/4 pair, a single pseudogene, as well as two other VCBP1 genes, are
upstream and downstream to the VCBP2/5 cluster, respectively, on the same chromosomal region (Fig. 1 and Additional file 1).
BAC 100j9 (VCBP1+/4+) and 62d19 (VCBP2+/5+) span
two regions of the VCBP-containing scaffold_295 (1 mb).
Based on sequence data acquired here (Additional files 5
and 6), the VCBP1 and VCBP4 genes found on BAC 100j9
were misassigned to scaffold_295 as a duplicated set in
the initial assembly of the amphioxus genome (Brafl1);
this region of the scaffold represents the allelic counterpart (BAC 5h9). However, BAC 100j9 can be placed accurately on a short scaffold_869 that is allelic to
scaffold_295 across the VCBP1/4 genetic region (Fig. 1).
VCBP3 gene
BACs that hybridize with a probe complementing VCBP3
do not co-hybridize with probes complementing VCBPs
1, 2, 4 or 5 and thus are likely not physically linked to

these latter VCBP genes (Fig. 1 and Additional files 7 and
8). The initial genome assembly indicates a single allele of
a single copy gene for VCBP3 on scaffold_1, suggesting a
lack of polymorphism. Restriction mapping, primerdirected PCR and limited sequencing were used to screen
the VCBP3+ BACs of which BAC 90f15 and BAC 54h3 are
allelic. PAC 30b18 encodes a distinct third allele of VCBP3
(Additional file 1).
VCBP3 is distinguished from the other VCBP genes in its
genomic organization. Specifically, [D2] V is encoded in
two versus three exons as seen in the other VCBP genes
(Fig. 2). Complete or partial exons, some of which encode
canonical splice sites, were identified in intronic regions
and exhibit extensive sequence identity to adjacent predicted coding exons (data not shown). Furthermore, two
additional chitin-binding domains (CBDs) map downstream from the CBD that is proximal to the V-encoding
exons (Fig. 2). The three exons encoding CBDs are divergent from each other and in some cases possess both
acceptor splice and termination signal sequences. Complementary DNA (cDNA) that incorporates the third
downstream CBD exon was recovered by RT-PCR using

Figure 2
Schematic representation of the exon/intron organization of VCBP genes
Schematic representation of the exon/intron organization of VCBP genes. VCBPs belong to five subgroups, each
gene encodes three domains; a pair of V-LIKE DOMAIN [3], designated as [D1] and [D2] V domains, and a C-terminal chitinbinding domain (CBD). VCBP2 and VCBP5 are related closely and share the same overall exon/intron organization; the other
VCBPs are more distantly related. A hyper-polymorphic region is localized to the second exon (EX2, shaded) encoding the Nterminal region of the [D1] V domain of VCBP2 and VCBP5. Additional polymorphisms have been noted (not shown) in various exons among different VCBP subgroup alleles. Exon and intron sizes are to scale or marked by (//). Lengths in nucleotides
are indicated directly below exons and introns. Secretion signals are encoded by EX1. Termination exons end in (*). All VCBP
exons utilize splicing frame 0 (sf0) (Aide-memoire, Splicing sites, http://www.imgt.org/), see Additional file 1: Table S1. One
representative allele was chosen for illustration purposes, and selected if the same exon/intron characteristics were observed
in at least two other alleles; alleles are: VCBP5S1*02, VCBP4S1*02, VCBP1S1*02, and VCBP3S1*02, respectively (see Additional file 1: Table S1). VCBP3 alleles possess additional, distantly related CBD-encoding ORFs (grey boxes). Some of these
appear to have splice signals and one version represents an out-of-frame splice variant. A similar sequence was recovered from
the transcription products of PAC 30b18 expression in a 293T transfection assay (see text). Variation in exon sizes and extensive variation in introns exists across most alleles and is noted (see text). Domains [D] are specified as: white diamond = [D1]
V, white triangle = [D2] V and white star = [D3] CBD; stop codons are indicated by (*).

RNA isolated from haplotypically-distinct animals. The
cDNA possess a premature stop codon at the CBD splice
junction; however, a pair of polyadenlyation signals are
encoded that would give rise to an mRNA encoding both
[D1] and [D2] V domains (unpublished).
Additional CBDs throughout the amphioxus genome
Queries of the amphioxus genome reveal a variety of
genetic regions encoding CBD-related ORFs. VCBPs 2, 4
and 5 contain exons encoding type-2 version (i.e.,
ChtBD2) CBDs; VCBPs 1 and 3 contain exons encoding

CBM_14-type CBDs and are related to those identified in
peritrophins (glycoproteins associated with the chitinrich gut environment of insects). The amphioxus genome
includes >250 CBD -encoding ORFs distributed over 31
scaffolds, of which most of these are of the CBM_14-type,
depending on search criteria and queries. Approximately
70 of these ORFs can be retrieved using default expect values for BLAST and the VCBP3 CBD exons as queries. The
remaining CBM_14-type CBDs are related more distantly.
Most CBDs are encoded by a single ORF; however, several
were split in two. This latter feature is more difficult to

Allelic polymorphism across the VCBP2/5 gene cluster
Allelic polymorphism across the VCBP2/5 gene cluster. A. Genomic profile (using Gestalt viewer) of BAC 62d19, indicating the location of inverted repeats (IRs) in the context of other genomic features. The top two graphs represent the CpG
contrast values (observed/expected) and the G+C percentage (green – below 43%, blue – between 43% and 50%, red – above
50%), both shown as deviations from the regional average. The middle section represents features with directionality: features
above the black midline are in the forward strand, while those displayed under the midline are in the reverse strand of the
sequence. The various tracks depict interspersed repeats (SINEs in red, LINEs in green, DNA and LTR elements in brown,
other repeats in purple), inverted repeats (IRF: blue blocks represent the repeats, diagonal lines connect the corresponding
repeats on opposite strands) and gene predictions by GenScan. The bottom section is the sequence scale, in kb. B. Dot plot
comparison against the corresponding region from BAC contig 63n5-43b24 (y-axis) reveals extensive haplotype variation (diagonal line breaks), much of which is associated with indel polymorphism. The VCBP2/5 cluster is boxed in B and the center
repeat (darkened square in B) is oriented with the corresponding region of the Gestalt genome viewer (A). A large break is
highlighted and corresponds to three large inverted repeats (dark blue) within the VCBP2 gene. Note: in order to conserve
space, dot plot cropped to reflect area surrounding VCBP genes. C. Calculated polymorphism (SNP; indels count as single base
change, see text) across the corresponding region in (A) and (B). The results are summarized as average match, mismatch and
mutated over the entire BAC: 87.7% of the aligned nucleotides are identical between the two sequences, but only 7.6% of the
aligned nucleotides are different. The discrepancy is due to the presence of gaps. Accounting for mismatched nucleotides,
those in front of small gaps, and counting every larger indel (>2 bp) as a single change results in 8.6% mutated between the two
sequences. Sequences are shown in same orientation as Figure 1. Matched: number of nucleotides aligned and identical; Mismatched: number of nucleotides aligned, but different; Mutated: combined mutation as insertion, deletion and point mutation

detect and could result in a significant undercount in the
actual number of CBDs. While the actual number of functional CBD exons in amphioxus is currently unknown, a
variety of randomly chosen CBD-encoding ORFs revealed
sequences encoding chitinase-like proteins when used as
queries against the JGI gene models (Brafl1, predicted
gene models). The functional relevance of the additional
CBDs in amphioxus is unknown, but a variety of antimicrobial properties have now been described for CBD-containing proteins from both animals and plants [10-14].
Using the same search criteria, 12 CBDs can be identified
in the genome of the cnidarian, Nematostella vectensis [15],
whereas the sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (Echinoderm; earlier diverging deuterostome), appears to lack
CBD-containing proteins altogether. Approximately 35–
40 CBDs can be identified in, Ciona intestinalis, a urochordate that has three VCBP genes related to amphioxus
VCBP3. In Ciona, most of the CBD-encoding DNA segments appear to be fragmented, while the full-length CBD
ORFs appear to belong to, or are derived from, VCBPrelated genes.
Pseudogenes and other features of the VCBP locus
The chromosomal region encoding the VCBP2/5 haplotypes has been characterized further using various combinations of database searches (BLAST), gene prediction/
modeling, and repeat masking. A high density of nonVCBP-related full-length and fragmented genes (see Additional file 1: Table S5) across the VCBP genetic region is
evident and their content may vary due to large haplotype-specific indels. Relatively few VCBP pseudogenes
have been identified in the amphioxus genome outside of
allelic scaffold_295 or scaffold_82. A recombined, paralogous VCBP4 gene, in which the [D1] V exons are downstream of the exon encoding the CBD, is predicted from
scaffold_466. A JGI-modeled transcript (Brafl1_ 104535)
across this VCBP4, which also encodes a C-terminal
region with four membrane-spanning units, has not been
recovered using RT-PCR approaches. Likewise, a paralogous VCBP1 (JGI, Brafl_87305) can be modeled from
scaffold_160. In this case, a coding region is predicted that
includes two novel domains, both a death effector
domain (DED)-like and death-like domain, followed by a
single VCBP1-type V domain and a C-terminal CBD. It has
not been possible to detect a transcript corresponding to
this prediction from RT-PCR experiments using tissues
from pooled animals. Based on the current assembly
(Brafl1), an additional paralogous VCBP1 pseudogene,
missing a portion of the coding region, is positioned
upstream of the VCBP1/4 genetic region in Fig. 1. No
other VCBP genes (including pseudogenes) have been
identified in the draft sequence of the amphioxus
genome. BAC screening did not identify any genes that
were not localized in the initial draft genome assembly.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/9/78

An Ngaro-like retrotransposon, which contains three
ORFs coding for putative gag, reverse transcriptase/ribonuclease and tyrosine recombinase [16], is found in the
vicinity of the VCBP2/5 cluster (haplotype B; see Additional file 9). Although several other Ngaro-like retrotransposons or their relics can be found distributed
throughout the amphioxus genome, the arrangement of
split direct repeats found in the VCBP2/5 cluster is distinct
from those found in other regions of the amphioxus
genome, as well as in other invertebrate genomes. Preliminary PCR data (not shown) suggests that this retroposon,
unlike other features of the VCBP haplotypes (see below),
is not haplotype-specific.
Haplotype-specific variation across the VCBP2/5 gene
cluster
As indicated previously, the VCBP2/5 cluster is of particular interest in terms of allelic variation. Pairwise sequence
comparison of the BAC and PAC clones, employing dot
plot analysis and pairwise alignments reveals that frequent sources of variation across the entire length of VCBP
haplotypes are large (> 3 bases; up to several kilobases)
and small (1–3 bases) indel polymorphisms. These can
include coding regions and/or (conserved) non-coding
segments (NCS), defined as fragments of sequences that
are either unique to the locus (i.e., haplotype-specific) or
are conserved perfectly throughout the genome (Fig. 3
and Additional files 2, 3, 4 and 10). Additional genomic
PCR comparisons have revealed a variety of shared indels
across haplotypes (data not shown), some of which are
predicted to affect gene structure and regulation, as well
transcription (Fig 4, see below). The calculated polymorphism (SNPs & indels count as single change) across the
region encompassing the VCBP2/5 cluster is 8.6% (Fig.
3C), as compared to 6–7% across the genome, the highest
polymorphism rate observed in sequenced metazoan
genomes [15]. PCR genotyping of additional animals
(data not shown), using primer sets derived from the three
VCBP2/5 haplotypes described here, reveals extensive variation in genomic PCR-product size and, in some cases,
absence of detectable product (L. Dishaw, unpublished).
This latter effect is potentially due to either large inserts
(indels) that preclude amplification or sequence variation
that leads to primer incompatibility. As regards this latter
point, appropriate controls were included to confirm PCR
reliability. The VCBP2/5 cluster of haplotype B
(scaffold_295) exhibits a higher frequency and density of
inverted repeats (IRs) than is seen in the rest of the
genome (Fig. 5A), whereas the density of tandem repeats
is consistent with the observed genome-wide densities
(Fig. 5B). The IR density of haplotype A (scaffold_82)
from the genome reference animal is more consistent with
the overall genome, suggesting that IR density is haplotype-dependent. This level of variation in repetitive ele-

signal peptide spliced into a C-terminal CBD termination
exon (see Fig 4).

Haplotype-specific exchanges alter gene structure and
transcriptional potential
Extensive indel variation is a feature of the VCBP gene
clusters. PCR haplotyping reveals sequence variation patterns that are consistent with exchange of sequence segments from elsewhere in the genome across haplotypes.
Full-length gene comparisons across the VCBP2/5 clusters
of haplotypes A, B and C described here reveal diverse
indels that could influence gene structure and regulation.
For example, two nearly identical copies (in opposing orientations and with a short spacer region) of a single exon
gene fragment orthologous to ribonucleotide reductases
are present in VCBP 5a of BAC contig 63n5-43b24 (haplotype A). A hybrid transcript of ribonucleotide reductase
and 3' region of VCBP 5a is predicted (Fig. 4).

The third haplotype of the VCBP2/5 cluster represented by
PAC 37d15 (i.e., haplotype C), isolated from a separate
animal, also has haplotype unique features (Fig. 4 and
Additional file 10 part C). Three nearly identical copies of
a large (4.3 kb) non-coding sequence with ORFs that are
distantly related to non-LTR LINE-like elements have been
identified. Two copies are in opposing orientations in two
different introns of the 5a gene; the third copy is located
in an intron of the VCBP 2b gene, in the same orientation
as the second copy in 5a (Fig. 4). A typical VCBP5 transcript, as well as a second transcript containing a haplotype-specific repeat-related ORF (99 amino acids) that is
spliced into the coding region of the [D1] V domain, are
predicted from gene modeling. No significant transcriptional variants are predicted that incorporate fragments of
the second and third copies of the repeat, which are in
inverse orientation. One alternative VCBP 5b transcript is
predicted that includes an atypical 65 amino acid spacer
region between the [D2] V domain and the CBD. This
additional ORF is derived from yet another haplotypespecific insert within that intron.

Three long sequence insertions are present in VCBP 5a
and 2b of BAC 62d19 (haplotype B) (see Fig. 4). One of
the introns of the 5a gene includes a ~1.2 kb reverse transcriptase/endonuclease-type sequence, an intron in the
VCBP 2b gene contains an ~3 kb insert and another downstream intron contains an additional ~6 kb insert. Both
inserts encode small ORFs related to gypsy-type retroelement sequences. The three inserts also include pairs of
large IRs (Fig. 3). This IR pair is absent in the VCBP2/5
cluster of the other two haplotypes A and C and is not
found elsewhere in the genome. Exon prediction and gene
modeling across the 5a gene of 62d19 predicts a typical
VCBP 5a transcript and one alternative splice variant,
which would lengthen the [D2] V domain through an
ORF contributed by the haplotype-specific insert. Other
gene models outside of the immediate boundary of the
VCBP2/5 locus predict a VCBP5 transcript encoding two
N-terminal short chain dehydrogenase/male sterility
domains. The short chain dehydrogenase/male sterilitycoding region is separated by ~3 kb immediately
upstream of the VCBP cluster and potentially contributes
an additional/alternative transcriptional start site.
Another haplotype-specific insert, which contributes yet
another ORF to one of the modeled transcripts described
above for the 5a gene, is found in the same upstream
region of the 63n5-43b24 haplotype (Fig. 4).
Two versions of VCBP 2b can be modeled for BAC 62d19,
which includes segments of the two large haplotype-specific inserts described above. One form includes a splice
variant that encodes a haplotype/insert-specific spacer
between the two V domains. The other form gives rise to
two additional transcripts: 1) a truncated version of VCBP
2b (two V domains) possessing an insert-specific ORF, an
early termination and a poly-A signal; and 2) a transcript
possessing an insert-specific (alternative) 5' start site and

Transcriptional potential of the VCBP gene cluster
Rare transcripts and/or alternative splice variants can be
lost or under-represented in total RNA isolated from animal tissues. Human 293T cells effectively transcribe most
foreign gene sequences and effect appropriate RNA splicing (e.g., based on previously characterized transcripts;
Dishaw unpublished; see Methods). In order to address
the potential functional consequences of haplotypic variation on the transcription of VCBPs, 293T cells were transfected with specific BAC or PAC clones; VCBP+ transcripts
were cloned and sequenced. PAC 37d15 is of particular
interest owing to its unusual repeat content and likely status as a copy number variant (CNV) haplotype. Analysis
of PCR products recovered from 293T cells transfected
with PAC 37d15 reveal the predominant expression of
full-length versions of VCBPs (mostly from VCBP 2b and
5b), as well as a variety of shorter, alternatively spliced
variants, including sequences that integrate components
of the 37d15-specific LINE-like repeat (Fig. 4). Certain
variants represent splice products across two genes. In several cases, fragments of what were thought to represent
non-coding sequence, including the haplotype-specific
LINE-like repeat, are transcribed independently or are
integrated into the VCBP transcript. Other unusual transcriptional variants, many with mis-sense mutations that
are spliced out of frame, could represent "background"
transcriptional noise. It is unlikely that these all represent
functional molecules; however some transcription products may be involved in the regulation of expression of the
VCBP genes. Additional screening will be required to ver-

floridae genome. Scaffold_295 (haplotype B) possesses a higher density of IRs than most other scaffolds of related size (and
larger) in the amphioxus genome, including scaffold_82 (haplotype A). A large density of the IRs is clustered in the VCBP-associated regions of scaffold _82 (_82b). B. A similar analytical approach was used to compare the distribution and density of tandem repeats. Tandem repeat density in the VCBP locus is consistent with other areas of the genome and are not found to be

ify the degree to which haplotype variation contributes to
transcriptional variation.

Discussion
Genomic features of VCBPs
Some of the VCBP genetic regions proved unusually complex to assemble; however, two major overlapping scaffolds consisting of an ~1.5 Mb chromosomal span
encoding VCBPs 2/5, 1 and 4 and a separate scaffold
(without any evidence for linkage to the primary locus)
encoding VCBP3 can be defined. In general terms, the
VCBP genes are interspersed among a variety of unrelated
genes. Genes and gene fragments are encoded across the
entire length of the locus, in both directions, and within
the intergenic and intronic regions of VCBPs. Additional
gene fragments and non-coding regions identified within
the VCBP genetic regions are distributed across the population as haplotype-specific indels.

By reference to the haplotypes defined in the BAC and
PAC sequences reported here, the amphioxus genome
assembly (Brafl1) [15] exhibits: allelic swaps, inversions
and artifactual fragmentation (i.e., misassemblies). The
accurate assembly of these haplotypes is confounded by
the high density of a variety of repeat types, including microsatellites, other tandem repeats, fragments of (in some
cases, complete) mobile elements, as well as a large
number of IRs (see below). Assembly is confounded further by tight clustering of related paralogous VCBP genes
separated from other VCBPs by large gene-rich intergenic
distances (see Additional file 1: Table S5).
Haplotype-variation includes gene CNV
The amphioxus reference genome (haplotypes A and B
from a single individual) possesses three genes in the
VCBP2/5 cluster in a 5, 2, and 5 pattern. Annotation of the
same region from a separate haplotype in, PAC 37d15,
reveals a fourth upstream tightly linked gene (fragment)
of the VCBP2-type, consistent with a VCBP 2, 5, 2 and 5
cluster. Subsequent molecular genetic analyses reveal that
variation in gene copy number not only is common in
VCBPs of the 2 and 5 type, but also among VCBP3 genes
(data not shown). These findings are consistent with previous observations that some animals possess more than
the six alleles of the VCBP2/5-type [2] (and unpublished).
CNVs likely are significant factors in both additional
germline complexity and transcriptional diversity.
Haplotype variation affects transcriptional potential
Across haplotypes, indel variation, mutation, mobile elements (e.g., interspersed repeats), and genetic exchanges
could significantly affect gene structure (and function) by
the addition and/or removal of splice sites, upstream regulatory sites, or ORFs. In order to explore this hypothesis,
a simple in vitro assay was developed that involves analy-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/9/78

sis of transcripts from BAC or PAC templates transfected
into human 293T cells. RT-PCR of the resulting transcripts
reveals diverse products, including variants possessing
haplotype-specific segments and others possessing in
frame stop codons or frameshifts at the alternative splice
junctions. Some of these haplotype-restricted transcripts
may be functionally relevant. Contribution of novel ORFs
from interspersed repeats, for example, has been termed
"exonization," and recent evidence suggests this phenomenon can play a significant role in modifying transcriptional diversity [17-22]. The transcriptional potential of
each haplotype has not been examined exhaustively; however, it is likely that haplotype-specific variation contributes to transcriptional diversity (Fig. 4) to a varying degree
in the population.
Haplotype-specific indels can affect gene structure and
activity
Across haplotypes, indels can consist of large non-coding
segments (NCS). These NCS can persist as single haplospecific elements or have broad distributions throughout
the genome (i.e., equivalent to typical repeat elements).
Furthermore, certain NCSs, which can be conserved across
some taxonomic lineages, have been shown to serve a
variety of regulatory functions [23-27]. Extensive haplotype variation, in the form of large indels, could result
from frequent population level genetic exchanges across
haplotypes via yet undetermined mechanisms. These
indels can affect gene content and expression by mobilizing, altering, contributing/removing both splice (e.g.,
cryptic splice signals) and start/stop signals. Haplotypespecific indels have been shown to influence gene activity,
polymorphism, and overall stability of other gene loci
[28-30]. If VCBPs function specifically in nonself recognition, shifts in allele frequencies potentially may factor in
population-level responses to emerging pathogens
[24,31,32].
Inverted repeats and haplotype variation
Genome-wide comparisons of various repeat types indicate that the density of IRs (Fig. 5A) is higher in VCBPrelated genetic regions than elsewhere in the genome. This
phenomenon varies across sequence haplotypes (Fig. 5A
and Additional file 10) and is supported by genomic
screening with additional animals (data not shown). Furthermore, the VCBP2/5 BAC and PAC haplotypes possess
unique sets of extended (large) IRs (palindromes; Additional file 10 part A-C). Palindromic sequences have been
shown to induce gene amplifications [29,30] or mitotic
(e.g., somatic) double-strand break-induced recombination [33]. Haplotype variation-induced structural modifications, particularly those associated with IRs or other
haplotype-specific intragenic insertions, could influence
transcription (i.e., pre-mRNA structural changes) and contribute to diversity and/or gene inactivation. In addition,

BMC Genetics 2008, 9:78

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/9/78

haplotypic variation of this type is subject to cumulative
effects [34,35] (Fig. 4). The presence/absence of palindromic sequences (or other IRs) across haplotypes suggests
that some are genetically unstable [36,37], adding an
additional layer of complexity to VCBP gene function and
polymorphism.

ranged from ~39–55 kb for PACs and ~100–185 kb for
BACs. PAC and BAC DNA [56] were restriction digested
and biotin end-labeled to resolve haplotypic differences.
Digested DNA was also Southern blotted and hybridized
with gene-specific probes to further resolve physical relationships (Fig. 1 and Additional file 1).

Repetitive elements, such as IRs, can target a chromosomal region for recombination; as the density of repeats
increases, the affected genetic region is associated with
increasing instability [38-42]. Furthermore, haplotypespecific indel variation, promoted and/or accentuated by
interspersed repetitive elements (or their relics), could
drive the polymorphism of the VCBP genes by disrupting
the homogenizing effects of gene conversion [43-48]. In
the case of the VCBP2/5 cluster (Fig. 1), VCBP 5b is most
likely homogenized by gene conversion; VCBP 2b, and to
a much greater extent, VCBP 5a, are not and instead are
experiencing rapid allelic divergence.

BAC/PAC sequencing
BAC and PAC genomic DNA was isolated with the NucleoBond DNA isolation kit (Clontech Laboratories/Macherey-Nagel). BAC clone 100j9 was sheared into ~3.5 kb
and ~6 kb (average insert length) fractions, subcloned
into the TOPO Shotgun Subcloning Kit (Invitrogen) and
sequenced. Shotgun style sequencing and the Staden
package (Gap4 assembly module) were employed to
assemble BAC 100j9 contigs. Ambiguities and/or low coverage regions, as well as non-overlapping segments, were
resolved by PCR amplification and sequencing, employing the BAC clones as templates. Genomic reference BACs
and PACs were sequenced initially at JGI and the University of Oklahoma Genome Center, respectively. Owing to
multiple assembly ambiguities, it was necessary to independently reassemble both BACs and PACs (see below).
BAC 63n5, 43b24, 62d19 and PAC 37d15 sequences were
assembled in Phrap (version 0.990329) using default
parameters. The assembly was viewed and edited in
Consed [57].

Conclusion
Library screening, selective sequencing, and genomic PCR
of amphioxus have revealed exceptionally complex VCBP
haplotypes, characterized by extensive indel variation, elevated variation in repeat type and density, and CNV. Relationships between these sequences and transcription
potential are suggested. Based on resolution of several
haplotypes, readout of their transcriptional potential and
definition of relationships between genomic content and
sequence variation, it is apparent that discrete haplotypespecific features of the genome coincide with extensive
allelic variation of VCBP genes. At this point it appears as
if the evolution of the VCBPs parallels that described for
vertebrate MHC regions [49,50] as well as the NK cell
(KIR) receptors [51,52]; such effects may mirror at the heritable population level some of the characteristics that are
achieved at the somatic level in vertebrates.

Methods
Bacterial artificial chromosome and P1 artificial
chromosome library screens
Specimens of the Florida lancelet, Branchiostoma floridae,
were collected along the coastline of Tampa Bay. Genomic
DNA was isolated from pooled animals (N = 7) and a P1
artificial chromosome (PAC) library was constructed [5355]. A bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library was
constructed from the sperm of the single animal (BAC
PAC Resources, Oakland, CA) and used as the genomic
resource animal (CHORI-302) [2]. This library coverage is
~17-fold; filter arrays were screened using 32P-labeled
probes complementing different VCBP coding regions
[1,2]. Probes complementing the VCBP1,4+ BAC were
based on the 5' and 3' distal sequences of VCBP1,4+ PAC
34i17. The insert lengths of Not I-digested PAC and BAC
clones were inferred initially from CHEF analysis and

Sequencing and sequence analysis
The fidelity of draft 1.0 of the amphioxus genome (Brafl1,
JGI) across VCBP loci was verified from constituent BAC
clones using various combinations of PCR-based
approaches: BAC end sequencing, primer-directed
sequencing, deletion subcloning and restriction fragment
prediction strategies.

RT-PCR-recovered cDNAs and deduced polypeptide
sequences were analyzed with Sequence Manipulation
Suite http://bioinformatics.org/sms2/[58], the EMBOSS
package of sequence tools [59] via the web portal, http://
liv.bmc.uu.se/emboss/, and BLAST searches [60] of
locally-maintained databases. Subsequent alignments
(cDNA or polypeptides) were constructed with CLUSTAL
X [61]. Routine sequence comparisons as well as exon
identification and gene annotation (using VCBP cDNA as
queries) from genomic sequences were performed with
local iterations of the BLAST package against local databases possessing complete BAC and PAC assemblies. Features of deduced polypeptide sequences were derived with
BLASTP, and domains were identified via Pfam http://
pfam.janelia.org/hmmsearch.shtml and the NCBI conserved domain database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi. Genomic sequences were aligned
primarily using a pairwise approach with the NeedlemanWunsch algorithm (employed locally with the Emboss

genomic regions were compared using a variety of dot
plot approaches (Emboss package), primarily using a window size of 11.

the amphioxus genome as apparently repetitive (in 1.34
million segments). We consider this extended library as
better suited for analysis, as it will minimize false positives from uncharacterized interspersed repeats.

Genomic annotation and gene prediction
Genomic position and intron/exon annotation of the
VCBP genes were determined initially using local BLAST
searches with VCBP cDNAs (VCBPs 1–5, accession no.
AF520472.1
(VCBP1S1*01),
AF520473.1
(VCBP2S1*01),

(VCBP3S1*01),
AF532182.1
(VCBP4S1*01),
AF532183.1
(VCBP5S1*01), respectively) as queries onto BAC and
PAC sequences. The VCBP gene and allele assignment is
according to IMGT-ONTOLOGY rules [3]. Since an
exhaustive EST library for the genome resource animal is
lacking, e.g., only some and incomplete VCBPs are found
[62]http://amphioxus.icob.sinica.edu.tw/ and because
the VCBP genetic regions of the genome (Brafl1) reflect a
variety of misassembly-associated artifacts that contribute
to incorrect gene modeling, the VCBP genes described in
this manuscript were computationally predicted from the
supporting BAC and PAC clones. These predicted transcripts (see Additional file 1: Table S1) were compared to
our extensive in-house cDNA collection, and, when possible, validated with cDNA recovered from multi-animal
screenings. These and any additional genes from the BAC
and PAC clones were predicted and compared first using
BLASTX (NCBI) and then by creating gene models for
BLASTP
searches
using:
GenScan
[63]http://
genes.mit.edu/GENSCAN.html, GeneID [64,65]http://
genome.imim.es/software/geneid/geneid.html,
FGENESH and FGENESH+ http://linux1.softberry.com/
all.htm or genomescan [63,66]http://genes.mit.edu/
genomescan.html. Details of splicing were visualized
using Splign [67]. Additional genomic annotation and the
GESTALT maps from Fig. 3 (and Additional file 10) were
created via the GESTALT workbench [68]http://db.sys
temsbiology.org/gestalt/.

A preliminary round of comparative analyses was accomplished first using ten randomly selected Branchiostoma
BAC clones deposited in the NCBI database and later
extended to the whole genome assembly. More thorough
genome-wide comparisons where made with Tandem
Repeat
Finder
http://tandem.bu.edu/trf/trf.down
load.html and Inverted Repeat Finder http://tan
dem.bu.edu/irf/irf.download.html software packages.

Genetic polymorphism and repeat analysis
Several categories of repetitive DNA were identified initially using RepeatMasker http://www.repeatmasker.org/
and the einverted program of the Emboss package. Since
the public repeat library for Branchiostoma is very limited
(library release 20061006, including 176 ancestral and
ubiquitous sequences and just 11 lineage-specific
sequences), the amphioxus genome was analyzed using
RepeatModeler
Open-1.0.3
http://www.repeatmas
ker.org/RepeatModeler.html, a de novo repeat family
identification and modeling package. This resulted in the
definition of an uncurated, extensive library of putative
amphioxus repeats. While the previous public library
masked just 2.7% of the amphioxus genome (in 0.24 million segments), the new repeat library identifies 25.7% of

The density of polymorphisms along the VCBP locus was
mapped using FastA [69] to align the sequences between
annotated interspersed repeats in one sequence, to the
complete locus in the other sequence. Repeats were identified using RepeatMasker version open-3.1.9, RM database version 20071204; corresponding repeats between
the two sequences were identified by matching genomic
sequences between consecutive alignments, and the
genomic alignments were completed by aligning the
matched repeats. In this way, aligning similar, but irrelevant repeats, was avoided. Once two genomic sequences
were aligned, indels and mismatches in all aligned segments (counting indels longer than two bp as single
events) were tallied into overlapping 5 kb windows, with
a window jump of 1 kb. Mutation counts (mismatches
plus indels) were normalized by the actual amount of
aligned sequence in each window.
The genome-wide repeat density for various repeat types
was estimated by analyzing the 3,032 scaffolds in the
amphioxus genome draft (Brafl1) using the Inverted
Repeats Finder software [70] with the following parameters: match = 2, mismatch = 3, delta = 5, match probability
= 80, indel probability = 10, minscore = 10, maxlength =
10000, maxloop = 10000, and -l to exclude lowercase
interspersed repeats from k-tuple matches. The resulting
compilations of inverted repeats (IRs) were consolidated
by filtering out alternative, overlapping IRs; those with
higher scores were retained. The amphioxus genome
(Brafl1) was analyzed in a similar manner using the Tandem Repeats Finder software [71]. Parameters are: match
= 2, mismatch = 7, delta = 7, match probability = 80, indel
probability = 10, minscore = 50, and maxperiod = 500.
The resulting lists of tandem repeats (TRs) were considered by filtering out alternative, overlapping TRs, keeping
those with longer word sizes. For each genomic scaffold,
the total numbers of observed IRs and TRs and the scaffold length were tallied. Since the last 600 kb of
scaffold_82 overlaps the region of interest, scaffold_82
was split into two parts (scaffold_82a and scaffold_82b)
and the IRs and TRs were tallied separately. The IR and TR

analyses were performed after masking the amphioxus
genome with first the limited RepeatMasker library and
then with the extended RepeatModeler library. A comparison of the two sets of alternative results showed no discrepancy when studying TRs, and more significant results
when studying IRs on the RepeatModeler-masked genome
sequence. These results highlight the importance of
appropriate masking of interspersed repeats prior to
downstream analyses.
BAC and PAC expression in HEK 293T cells
To help predict the transcriptional potential of VCBP
genetic regions, amphioxus-specific PAC or BAC DNA
clones were selected and expressed in stable lines of
human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells. PAC clone
37d15 encodes a particularly unusual haplotype and was
used to characterize transcriptional repertoires. Human
HEK 293T cells were grown to 95% confluence on 10 cm
plates and transfected (10–30 ug per 10 cm plate) with
unmodified NucleoBond-purified (Clontech) BAC or
PAC DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After
72 hrs, total RNA was isolated from the cultures, treated
with DNase, reverse transcribed and amplified using
primers to known genetic regions. Primers were anchored
in either the VCBP chitin-binding domain (CBD) or at the
poly-A tail (e.g., oligo-dT primer) and at the upstream signal peptide-encoding region (forward or sense primer).
PCR products were size-verified and subsequently cloned
by direct-PCR cloning. Nylon lifts of recombinant bacterial clones, hybridized with 32P-labeled VCBP-specific oligonucleotides, were size-selected by PCR, and sequenced.
