Abstract
Background: The phylogenetic position of pycnogonids is a long-standing and controversial issue
in arthropod phylogeny. This controversy has recently been rekindled by differences in the
conclusions based on neuroanatomical data concerning the chelifore and the patterns of Hox
expression. The mitochondrial genome of a sea spider, Nymphon gracile (Pycnogonida,
Nymphonidae), was recently reported in an attempt to address this issue. However, N. gracile
appears to be a long-branch taxon on the phylogenetic tree and exhibits a number of peculiar
features, such as 10 tRNA translocations and even an inversion of several protein-coding genes.
Sequences of other pycnogonid mitochondrial genomes are needed if the position of pycnogonids
is to be elucidated on this basis.
Results: The complete mitochondrial genome (15,474 bp) of a sea spider (Achelia bituberculata)
belonging to the family Ammotheidae, which combines a number of anatomical features considered
plesiomorphic with respect to other pycnogonids, was sequenced and characterized. The genome
organization shows the features typical of most metazoan animal genomes (37 tightly-packed
genes). The overall gene arrangement is completely identical to the arthropod ground pattern, with
one exception: the position of the trnQ gene between the rrnS gene and the control region.
Maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference trees inferred from the amino acid sequences of
mitochondrial protein-coding genes consistently indicate that the pycnogonids (A. bituberculata and
N. gracile) may be closely related to the clade of Acari and Araneae.
Conclusion: The complete mitochondrial genome sequence of A. bituberculata (Family
Ammotheidae) and the previously-reported partial sequence of Endeis spinosa show the gene
arrangement patterns typical of arthropods (Limulus-like), but they differ markedly from that of N.
gracile. Phylogenetic analyses based on mitochondrial protein-coding genes showed that
Pycnogonida may be authentic arachnids (= aquatic arachnids) within Chelicerata sensu lato, as
indicated by the name 'sea spider,' and suggest that the Cormogonida theory – that the pycnogonids
are a sister group of all other arthropods – should be rejected. However, in view of the relatively
weak node confidence, strand-biased nucleotide composition and long-branch attraction artifact,
further more intensive studies seem necessary to resolve the exact position of the pycnogonids.

Background
Pycnogonids, or sea spiders, comprising about 1163
extant species [1], are a special group of exclusively marine
arthropods that are distributed from the intertidal zone to
the abyssal depths in all the seas around the world. The
pycogonids are traditionally classified as a sister group or
even an ingroup taxon of euchelicerates, which comprises
the arachnids, xiphosurans and extinct eurypterids [2,3].
However, the phylogenetic position of pycnogonids has
been vigorously debated during the last two centuries, as
summarized in a recent review of pycnogonid affinities by
Dunlop and Arango [4]. According to this review, there
have been a number of controversial hypotheses related to
this issue. The pycnogonids have been regarded as either
degraded crustaceans [5,6], a transitional form between
crustaceans and arachnids [7-9], an isolated group unrelated to other arthropods [10-12], a sister group of aquatic
arachnids or mites within Chelicerata [13-15], a sister
group of euchelicerates [3,4,16,17], or a sister group of all
other extant euarthropods (encompassing chelicerates,
myriapods, crustaceans and hexapods) [18-20]. Because
of rapid methodological improvements in phylogenetic
systematics and related fields such as developmental biology, molecular biology and computational biology (bioinformatics), recent phylogenies have continuously
attempted to resolve this issue and have eliminated many
of the possible hypotheses, leaving only the two most
plausible to be examined: namely that pycnogonids are
either a sister group of euchelicerates or a sister group of
euarthropods.
Pycnogonids have continually been recovered as a sister
group of euchelicerates not only by a convincing autapomorphy – 'chelicerae/chelifore'- between the pycnogonids
and euchelicerates, but also by a number of cladistic and
phylogenetic studies based on molecular data (DNA or
amino acid sequences), combined morphological and
molecular data, Hox expression data and immunohistochemical data [4,21-32].
On the other hand, the hypothesis that the pycnogonids
are a sister group of euarthropods (all extant arthropods
except for pycnogonids) was initially formally proposed
by Zrzavy et al. on the basis of all the available morphological and gene sequence data [18]. They named the
clade of euchelicerates and mandibulates (excluding Pycnogonida) "Cormogonida;" they share the putative
autapomorphic characteristic of a gonopore on the trunk.
Pycnogonids have multiple gonopores on the bases of
their legs. Although some authors have recovered this
relationship [14,19,20,33,34], the presence of gonopores
on the trunk in Cormogonida has been doubted as a plesiomorphic character [4].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/343

Interestingly, a detailed neuroanatomical study of the
Anoplodactylus sp. protonymphon lava [20] suggested that
the chelifore of euchelicerates is not homologous to the
chelicerae of pycnogonids, but rather that it is homologous to the protocerebral appendages ("great appendages") proposed for ancestral arthropods [35,36]. These
authors suggested that the pycnogonids are a sister group
of all the euarthropods. However, more recent studies of
Hox expression patterns in Endeis spinosa [29,30] refuted
the result of the neuroanatomical study [20]. The Hox
expression data suggested that all the anterior-most
appendages of all extant arthropods (chelifore of pycnogonids, chelicerae of euchelicerates and the first antennae
of mandibulates) are homologous and deutocerebral,
indicating that protocerebral appendages have been lost
in all extant arthropods.
In recent years, comparison of complete mitochondrial
genomes has become a very powerful tool for reconstructing arthropod phylogeny [15,37-41]. Mitochondrial
genomes contain a variety of useful phylogenetic information, such as gene orders and orientations, alternative start
codons of protein-coding genes, transfer RNA and ribosomal RNA secondary structures, genetic code variations,
and features of the control region for genome replication
and transcription [42]. Typical metazoan mitochondrial
genomes are circular, 14–16 kb in size, and encode 13
proteins, large and small subunit ribosomal RNAs (rrnL
and rrnS) and 22 tRNAs [38,43]. The 13 polypeptides are
involved in ATP synthesis coupled to electron transfer
during O2 consumption [ATP synthetase subunits (atp6
and atp8), cytochrome C oxidase subunits (cox1-cox3),
apocytochrome b (cob) and NADH dehydrogenase subunits (nad1-nad6 and nad4L)].
Approximately 1014 complete mitochondrial genome
sequences have been determined to date from metazoa
including 243 protostomes (126 arthropods, 21 nematodes, 4 annelids, 33 mollusks, 16 platyhelminthes, 3 brachiopods, 1 echiuran, 1 bryozoan, 1 acanthocephalan and
2 chaetognaths, 24 cnidarian, 1 onychophoran, 4 placozoan, 5 poriferan, 1 priapulidan) and 771 deuterostomes
(752 chordates, 16 echinoderms and 2 hemichordates, 1
xenoturbella) (GenBank status on June, 2007). Of the
metazoan mitochondrial genomes sequenced, 126 were
from arthropods (65 hexapods, 34 crustaceans, 4 myriapods and 23 chelicerates). In pycnogonids, a partial mitochondrial genome for E. spinosa (family Endeidae) was
reported by Hassanin [15] and a complete mitochondrial
genome sequence for N. gracile (family Nymphonidae) by
Podsiadlowski and Braband [44]. According to these
recent reports, phylogenetic analyses of protein-coding
genes show that pycnogonids may be associated with
Acari (ticks and mites), although the authors acknowl-

edged that the result may be due to a long-branch attraction artifact and higher A+T content.
The N. gracile mitochondrial genome has a peculiar gene
order with extensive inversion of protein-coding genes
and translocations of 10 tRNA genes, which are not typically found in arthropods [44]. These peculiar characteristics are probably restricted to the N. gracile lineage, since
the partial E. spinosa mitochondrial genome possesses the
arthropod ground pattern of mitochondrial gene arrangements. Furthermore, the N. gracile branch on the phylogenetic trees presented by Podsiadlowski and Braband [44]
was very long, as was also the case for Acari. This may have
given rise to an artifactual relationship between Acari and
Pycnogonida, which suggests that N. gracile may not be an
appropriate representative of the pycnogonids. Thus,
additional pycnogonid mitochondrial genomes must be
sequenced if such information is to be used to address the
problem of the phylogenetic position of pycnogonids
[45,46].
In this study, we present a complete new pycnogonid
mitochondrial genome from a sea spider, Achelia bituberculata, belonging to the family Ammotheidae, which combines a number of anatomical features considered
plesiomorphic with respect to other pycnogonids. The
genome is characterized and compared to those of other
arthropods, including two pycnogonids, N. gracile and E.
spinosa. We attempt to use the data obtained in this study
to address the long-standing and hotly-debated issue of
the phylogenetic position of pycnogonids.

Results and discussion
Genome organization
The mitochondrial genome of A. bituberculata is 15,474
bp in length, which is similar to those of arthropod mitochondrial genomes (Table 1). It includes 13 protein-coding genes (cox1-cox3, nad1-nad6, nad4L, atp6, atp8 and
cob), 22 tRNA genes (trnA, trnR etc.), two ribosomal RNA
genes (rrnL and rrnS) and one large non-coding region [=
a plausible control region (CR); 977 bp], as typically
found in metazoa (Fig. 1 and Table 2). The components
are compactly juxtaposed. There are even some overlapping nucleotides between trnC and trnW (1 bp), nad3 and
trnA (3 bp), and trnE and trnF (1 bp) (Table 2). The order
and orientation of the gene arrangement pattern is identical to that of a horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus, except
for the position of the trnQ gene (Fig. 2).
Comparison of gene arrangements
As shown in Fig. 2, the mitochondrial gene arrangement
of A. bituberculata was compared with that of L.
polyphemus, which is considered a putative ground pattern
for arthropods [38], and with those of two sea spiders, N.
gracile and E. spinosa. The identical gene arrangement pat-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/343

tern shown in A. bituberculata and L. polyphemus except for
the trnQ gene is an interesting feature because the other
sea spider, N. gracile, has an extensive inversion (from trnI
to cox2) and ten tRNA gene translocations (Fig. 2). The
partial genome of E. spinosa has the same gene arrangement pattern as those of L. polyphemus and A. bituberculata.
The trnQ gene in A. bituberculata is located between rrnS
and the control region (CR). It is found between trnIand
trnM in most arthropods [38]. Comparisons among the
trnQ positions in arthropods (Fig. 3) show that the rrnStrnQ-CR arrangement in pycnogonids is also found in the
jumping spider Habronattus oregonensis (Araneae, Salticidae) [47] and in a collembolan, Tetrodontophora bielanensis
[48]. A similar pattern (rrnS-trnI-trnQ-CR) is also observed
in the Chinese earth tiger spider Ornithoctonus huwena
(Araneae, Theraphosidae) [47]. However, collembolans
and spiders are not closely related, and another terrestrial
spider (Heptathela) and another collembolan (Gomphiocephalus hodgsoni) have the Limulus-like arthropod ground
pattern (trnI-trnQ-trnM). Thus, the rrnS-trnQ-CR arrangement found in a pycnogonid (A. bituberculata), a collembolan (T. bielanensis) and two terrestrial spiders (H.
oregonensis and O. huwena) is likely to be homoplastic.
Further intensive comparative studies are needed to examine whether the rrnS-trnQ-CR pattern is indeed a homoplastic feature or an important phylogenetic marker.
Furthermore, A. bituberculata and N. gracile have two different anticodon-possessing trnL genes, marked L1 and
L2, which have the same orientations and positions as
those in most other chelicerates and myriapods. Directly
abutted tandem arrays of two trnLs between rrnL and nad1
(rrnL-L1-L2-nad1) are also observed in other metazoan
phyla [49,50]. In Pancrustacea (= Hexapoda and Crustacea), L1 is generally located between rrnL and nad1, and
L2 between cox1 and cox2 [50]. The rrnL-L1-nad1 and cox1L2-cox2 arrangement patterns are considered to be critical
evidence for a monophyletic origin of pancrustaceans
other than the chelicerates and myriapods in arthropods.
Therefore, the finding of the rrnL-L1-L2-nad1 arrangement
in pycnogonids rejects the view that pycnogonids have
crustacean affinities [5-9], generally regarded as an oldfashioned hypothesis today.
Base composition and codon usage pattern
As shown in Table 1, the overall A+T content in the mitochondrial genome of A. bituberculata is 77.0% (+ strand: A
= 38%; C = 12%; G = 11%; T = 39%). This A+T content is
much higher than those in L. polyphemus (67.6%) and the
scorpions (64.5 and 67.0%), but is similar to those in
Acari and Araneae (69.8–80.0%), including N. gracile
(76.6%).

a indicates gap nucleotides (positive value) or overlapped nucleotides (negative value) between two adjacent genes.
* Incomplete termination codon, which is probably extended by post-transcriptional adenylation.

Metazoan mitochondrial genomes usually present a clear
strand bias in nucleotide composition [15,44]. Table 3
shows the AT- and CG-skews of each of the 13 proteincoding and 2 ribosomal RNA genes and those of the
whole genome (total) in A. bituberculata mitochondria.
The results show no marked strand-bias in nucleotide
composition. The AT-skew for all genes is negative
whether they are on the (+) or the (-) strand. The CG-skew
is positive for four genes and negative for five on the (+)
strand. The CG-skew for all six genes on the (-) strand is
negative. This is totally different from the clear strand-bias
observed in N. gracile.

Investigation of the anticodon and codon usage patterns
in the protein-coding genes of the A. bituberculata mitochondrial genome indicates that the nucleotides in the
3rd codon position are primarily 'A' or 'T' rather than 'C'
or 'G'. Codons composed of only 'A' and 'T' are predominantly used, which seems to reflect the high A+T bias composition of the entire genome. A strong preference for
A+T-rich codons is found in A. bituberculata as in mitochondrial protein-coding genes in general (Table 4). For
example, the most frequently-used codons are L(UUA)
(367 times) and I(AUU) (365 times). Additional file 1
shows the usage of leucine and serine codons in chelicer-

There was no overlap between these genes. They account
for 76% of the entire mitochondrial genome length. In
terms of the lengths of individual protein-coding genes, A.
bituberculata has relatively short atp8 (45 aa) and nad3
(104 aa) compared to other chelicerates (including N.
gracile) and myriapods [See Additional file 2]. In contrast,
the nad4 gene of A. bituberculata (454 aa) and N. gracile
(460 aa) and nad6 of A. bituberculata (163 aa) are larger
than those in the other species. While nad6 is dramatically
reduced in N. gracile (125 aa), that in A. bituberculata is
similar in size (163 aa) to the other chelicerates (141~158
aa).
Amino acid usages and A+T contents of mitochondrial
protein-coding genes were compared with those of chelicerates [See Additional file 1]. Greater numbers of Asn
(216 aa) and Met (363) are used than in the other chelicerates. The A+T content of the third codon positions of
the 13 protein-coding genes is 85.99%, which is lower
than in N. gracile (90.50%) and higher than in L.
polyphemus (74.70%).

A circular map of the complete mitochondrial
genome of the sea spider Achelia bituberculata (Family Ammotheidae). Protein and rRNA genes are abbreviated as follows: atp6 and atp8 (genes for ATPase subunits 6
and 8), cox1-cox3 (genes for cytochrome C oxidase subunits
I-III), cob (gene for apocytochrome b), nad1-nad6 and nad4L
(genes for NADH dehydrogenase subunits 1–6 and 4L), and
rrnS and rrnL (genes for 12S and 16S rRNAs). All the 22
tRNA genes are located among protein- and/or tRNA-coding
genes. The tRNA genes are named using single-letter amino
acid abbreviations, with the exception of those coding for
leucine and serine, which are named L1 for the tRNALeu(UUR)
(anticodon TAA) gene, L2 for the tRNALeu(CUN) (anticodon
TAG) gene, S1 for the tRNASer(UCN) (anticodon TGA) gene
and S2 for the tRNASer(AGN) (anticodon GCT) gene. The

ates and pycnogonids and reveals some interesting features in the usage of L(UUR) and L(CUN). Totals of 415
and 414 L(UUR) codons are used in A. bituberculata and
N. gracile, respectively, which are the highest usage patterns of these codons in the chelicerates observed to date.
A total of 125 L(CUN) codons are used in A. bituberculata
(73 in N. gracile), similar to the usage patterns in Araneae
and Acari (105~214) but different from those in L.
polyphemus (259) and scorpions (241~287). That is, the
L(CUN) codon frequency in A. bituberculata is similar to
that in Araneae and Acari.
Protein-coding genes
The aggregate length of all the 13 protein-coding genes is
11,112 bp [A+T 8,446 bp (76%), G+C 2,666 bp (24%)].

The start and stop codons of the 13 protein-coding genes
of the A. bituberculata mitochondrial genome were identified by comparison with those of other known arthropods; particular attention was given to the amino acid
sequence alignment in order to identify the most likely
codon in ambiguous situations. As shown in Table 2, the
start codons of 12 mitochondrial of the protein-coding
genes (excluding cox1) are 'ATN', which is typical of most
metazoan mitochondria [43]: 'ATG' is the start codon for
nad2, nad4L, nad6, cox2, cox3 and cob; 'ATT' is the start
codon found in nad5 and atp6; and 'ATA' is the start codon
for nad1, nad3, nad4 and atp8. A less typical 'GAT' start
codon appears in the remaining cox1 gene. On the other
hand, only four of the protein-coding genes are terminated with a complete stop codon: 'TAA' in nad4L and
cox3 and 'TAG' in nad1 and nad3. The remaining eight
genes are terminated using truncated stop codons that are
presumably completed by post-transcriptional polyadenylation [51]: 'TA' for nad4 and nad6, and 'T' for nad2,
nad5, cox1, cox2, cob, atp6 and atp8.
Transfer RNA genes
All 22 of the tRNAs typically found in metazoan mitochondrial genomes were identified in A. bituberculata. All
these genes are located among protein- and/or rRNA-coding genes (Fig. 1 and Table 2). Twenty-two putative secondary structures were predicted from the tRNA gene
sequences (Fig. 4). Most of the tRNAs are capable of forming the typical clover-leaf structure, with the exception of
tRNAAla (which lacks both the DHU and TψC arms),
tRNASer(AGN), tRNATyr and tRNAVal (which lacks only the
DHU arm). The lengths of the TψC and DHU arms in the
18 tRNAs with a stable clover-leaf shape range from 4 to

Comparison of the mitochondrial gene arrangements of three sea spiders, Achelia bituberculata,

arrangements in A. bituberculata (complete) and E. spinosa
(partial) are the same as the arthropod ground pattern
shown in L. ployphemus, except for the unexpected placement of trnQ (Q) in A. bituberculata. In N. gracile, however, the
gene arrangement differs markedly from the other two pycnogonids. The two trnL1 and trnL2 genes are marked by L1
and L2, respectively. L1 and L2 in A. bituberculata and N. gracile

12 bp, and the variable loops range in size from 4 to 5 bp.
tRNASer(AGN) with an unpaired DHU arm has been
reported in the mitochondrial genomes of a number of
metazoa including the sea spider N. gracile [44], the centipede Scutigera coleoptrata [52], the jumping spider Habronattus oregonensis [47], the nematodes Caenorhabditis
elegans and Ascaris suum [53] and the annelid Lumbricus
terrestris [39]. The DHU arm of tRNAAla in N. gracile does
not form a stable stem; however, the other two tRNAs,
tRNATyr and tRNAVal, are folded into typical clover-leaf
shapes [44].
Twenty of the 22 tRNAs have a completely matched 7-bplong amino-acyl stem, and the remaining two, tRNAGlu
and tRNATyr, have a single mismatch within the stem.

to the typical arthropod trnI-trnQ-M arrangement between
nad2 and the CR, the trnQ gene in A. bituberculata is found
between rrnS and the CR. Such trnQ translocation appears in
the two terrestrial spiders, O. huwena and H. oregonensis, and

tRNAMet) have a single mismatch within this stem. It is not
uncommon for some mitochondrial tRNAs to have stem
mismatches, which are probably repaired by a post-transcriptional editing process [54].
The tRNA anticodon sequences in A. bituberculata (Table
4) are identical to those of the corresponding tRNAs of
other metazoans with the exception of tRNAlys and
tRNASer(AGN). tRNAlys and tRNASer(AGN) in both A. bituberculata and N. gracile possess 'UUU' and 'UCU' anticodons,
respectively, instead of 'CUU' and 'GCU', which are more
commonly found in invertebrates and some vertebrates
[44,55].

Ribosomal RNA genes
The trnV gene separates rrnS from rrnL, as in most arthropods. The sizes of rrnS and rrnL are approximately 1,210
bp and 776 bp, respectively [See Additional file 3]. These
are similar to the centipedes Lithobius forficatus (1,188 bp
and 763 bp) and Scutigera coleoptrata (1192 bp and 766
bp), but are slightly shorter than those of L. polyphemus
(1,296 bp and 799 bp). Compared with that in arachnids,
the length of rrnL in A. bituberculata is similar to those in
four species of Acari (1,199 bp in Amblyomma triguttatum,
1,214 bp in Ixodes holocyclus, 1,212 bp in Ornithodoros
moubata and 1,190 bp in Rhipicephalus sanguinensis) and
larger than those in three terrestrial spiders (1,048 bp in

O. huwena, 1,018 bp in H. oregonensis and 1,101 bp in H.
hangzhouensis). On the other hand, rrnS in A. bituberculata
is larger than those in four species of Acari (693 bp in A.
triguttatum, 716 bp in I. holocyclus, 686 bp in O. moubata,
687 bp in R. sanguineus), and three terrestrial spiders (668
bp in O. huwena, 619 bp in H. oregonensis, 698 bp in H.
hangzhouensis). The A+T contents of rrnL and rrnS are
78.7% (A, 505 nts; T, 447 nts) and 78.0% (A, 313 nts; T,
295 nts), respectively. These account for over 77% of the
entire A. bituberculata mitochondrial genome. The rrnL
gene of A. bituberculata has the highest similarities with
those of N. gracile (59.5%) and L. polyphemus (57.3%),

polyphemus (50.1%).
Control region
A large noncoding region [= a plausible control region
(CR); 977 bp] is found between trnQ and trnI. It includes
three tandem repeats, the first and second of which are
completely identical in length (315 bp) and sequence
(Fig. 5A). However, the third repeat (282 bp) is 33 bp

shorter than the other two at the 3'-end, and one nucleotide is different in the 315-bp repeat (Fig. 5A). The
repeats have unique stem and loop structures that may
play key roles in controlling the replication and transcription of the mitochondrial genome (Fig. 5B). The A+T content of the CR is 79%, which is similar to those of most
chelicerates (Table 1).

The inclusion of Pycnogonida within Arachnida
As shown in Fig. 6, phylogenetic analyses based on the
amino acid sequences of 12 protein-coding genes for 30
arthropods and 4 outgroups (1 onychophoran, 2 annelids
and 1 mollusk) as shown in Table 1 indicate that Pycnogonida, including A. bituberculata and N. gracile, are clustered together (BPML = 100, BPBI = 100, BPP = 1.0), and
located within the monophyletic Chelicerata (BPML = 85,
BPBI = 92, BPP = 1.0). L. polyphemus appears to be a sister
of all the other chelicerates (= Arachnida). Although a
monophyletic Arachnida (Scorpiones, Araneae and Acari)
including Pycnogonida is supported by node confidence
values that are very low (BPML = 55, BPBI = 48), Scorpiones
are placed as the most basal arachnids and Pycnogonida,
Araneae and Acari form a monophyletic group (BPML = 80,
BPBI = 73, BPP = 0.99); Pycnogonida is identified as a sister group of the clade of Araneae and Acari within Arachnida.

When the onychophoran Epiperipatus biolleyi is employed
as a single outgroup, the resultant tree [See Additional file
4] is the same as Fig. 6 in the position of pycnogonids
within Arachnida, although arthropod monophyly is not
supported. The two pycnogonids examined, A. bituberculata and N. gracile, are clustered together (BPML = 100, BPBI
= 100, BPP = 1.0) within the monophyletic Chelicerata
(BPML = 92, BPBI = 92, BPP = 1.0). Pycnogonida again
appears as a sister group of the clade of Araneae and Acari
(BPML = 72, BPBI = 73, BPP = 0.99).
Two previous studies based on the mitochondrial genome
sequences of E. spinosa [15] and N. gracile [44] indicated
that the Pycnogonida-Acari affinity might have resulted
from biased features such as the strand-biased nucleotide
contents and long-branch attraction. Interestingly, the A.
bituberculata mitochondrial genome shows no marked
strand-bias nucleotide composition (Table 3). Since most
of the other chelicerates and N. gracile have strand-biased
nucleotide contents [44]as well as extremely long
branches on the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 6), the possibility
remains that the appearance of Pycnogonida within
Arachnida may result from artifacts of analysis due to the
strand-biased and long-branching patterns.
To test whether the inclusion of Pycnogonida within
Arthropoda results from long-branch attraction artifacts,
we removed 9 long-branch taxa – all 7 Acari members and
2 terrestrial spiders (H. oregonensis and O. huwena) – from
the dataset for the tree in Additional file 4. 1, and then
conducted a new phylogenetic analysis with 21 ingroup
and 1 outgroup taxa [See Additional file 5A]. We then
removed N. gracile as well because of its long branching
pattern, and reconstructed a new phylogenetic tree with
only 20 ingroup and 1 outgroup taxa [See Additional file
5B]. In addition, we removed the 7 pancrutacean taxa and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/343

1 onychophoran from the data sets including the 22 and
21 taxa, and then reconstructed additional phylogenetic
trees with only 14 and 13 taxa, respectively [See Additional file 5C and 5D]. In the subsequent ML analyses,
while Onychophora was used as an outgroup for the first
and second reduced datasets including 22 and 21 taxa, the
4 remaining pancrustaceans were used as outgroups for
the analyses with only 14 and 13 taxa. Although the longbranch taxa were removed, the ML trees inferred from the
four different reduced alignment data sets showed that the
pycnogonids are consistently clustered with the terrestrial
spider H. langzhouensis [See additional file 5A, C, D],
except for the ML tree with the 21 taxa in which A. bituberculata appears as a sister group of euchelicerates [See Additional file 5B].
The present findings conflict with the two major hypotheses that Pycnogonida is a sister group of the monophyletic Euchelicerata (= Arachnida + Xiphosura) or that
it is a sister group of the monophyletic Cormogonida (=
Euchelicerata + Myriapoda + Pancrustacea). Nevertheless,
the inclusion of Pycnogonida within Arachnida is compatible with some previous analyses based on combinations of 253 morphological characteristics and molecular
data (complete 18S rDNA and the D3 region of 28S
rDNA) [14], and the mitochondrial protein-coding genes
[15,44], which indicated that Pycnogonida appears
within Arachnida. More recently, Mallatt and Giribet [31]
on the basis of nearly-complete 18S and 28S rDNA
sequences, and Giribet et al. [32] on the basis of parsimony analyses of combined data for 7 nuclear genes, 2
mitochondrial genes and 375 morphological characters,
both showed that Pycnogonida is united with Chelicerata
with very weak support and Cormogonida is strongly
rejected. The present result is consistent with theirs in that
Cormogonida is rejected and Pycnogonida has an affinity
with Chelicerata. However, they did not suggest that Pycnogonida may possibly be included within Arachnida;
many morphological taxonomists may not agree with this
point of view. Thus, it is likely that the inclusion of Pycnogonida within Arachnida, deduced only from mitochondrial genome data [15,44], will remain an open question.
In addition, Scorpiones are often considered to be "one of
the most primitive arachnids" because they possess a
number of plesiomorphic character states, even though
their phylogenetic position remains controversial. Recent
publications based on mitochondrial protein-coding
genes [56,57] show that Scorpiones is a sister group of all
other arachnids (Acari and Araneae). The present result
(Fig. 6) is consistent with previous reports [56,57] showing that Scorpiones is a sister group of the clade of Pycnogonida plus Araneae plus Acari.

genes of 30 arthropods and 4 non-arthropods. The pycnogonids Achelia bituberculata and Nymphon gracile appear within
the monophyletic Chelicerata with high node confidence values. Scorpiones are placed as the basal arachnid group. The inclusion of Pycnogonida within Arachnida is shown in this tree. The monophylies of Pancrustacea (Crustacea plus Hexapoda) and
Myriochelata or Paradoxopoda (Myriapoda and Chelicerata) are strongly supported. The numbers above/below the branches
indicate the node confidence values: BPML (bootstrap proportion in the maximum likelihood analysis), BPBI (bootstrap proportion in Bayesian inference) and BPP (Bayesian posterior probability) in order. The tree was obtained from a final alignment
2232 aa sites in length (refer to Materials and Methods for more detailed information). The log likelihood value of the best tree
is -72575.641555. For more detail information about the taxon, refer to Table 1.

The tree in Fig. 6 shows the paraphyly of Myriapoda [58];
the placement of Collembola as a sister of all other pancrustacean taxa [41]; the monophyly of Myriapoda and
Chelicerata (= Myriochelata or Paradoxopoda) [15,16,40,
59];and the monophyly of Pancrustacea [15,16,19,50].
Complete mitochondrial genome sequences need to be
determined from another important sister group (Tardigrada) of the arthropods in order to elucidate the deep
arthropod phylogeny, including the phylogenetic position of pycnogonids.

Conclusion
This study presents the complete sequence of the mitochondrial genome from a pycnogonid, A. bituberculata
(Family Ammotheidae). This complete sequence and a
previously-reported partial sequence of Endeis spinosa
show the typical gene arrangement patterns of arthropods
(Limulus-like), but they differ from that of N. gracile. Thus,
it is most likely that the peculiar arrangements found in N.
gracile are only present in the family Nymphonidae or
even in the genus Nymphon. Phylogenetic trees based on
amino acid sequences deduced from mitochondrial protein-coding genes showed that Pycnogonida may be
authentic arachnids (= aquatic arachnids) within Chelicerata, as indicated by the name 'sea spider', and suggest
that the Cormogonida theory, which considers the pycnogonids a sister of all other arthropods, should be rejected.
However, since node confidence values supporting the
Pycnogonida inclusion within Arachnida are slightly low
and the possibility of long-branch attraction artifact still
remains, further more intensive studies seem necessary to
resolve the problem.

sc, 68°C for 5~13 min; 20 cycles at 94°C for 15 s, 50°C

The PCR reactants were loaded on a 0.7% agarose gel and
stained with ethidium bromide to visualize the bands
using an ultraviolet transilluminator. PCR products of
approximately 5 kb (rrnL-cox1) and 11 kb (cox1-rrnL) covering the entire mitochondrial genome were observed.
The two PCR products were purified using the PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN Co., Germany) and were ligated with
the pGEM T-easy vector (Promega Co., USA). The ligation
mixtures were transformed into Escherichia coli host strain
DH5-α. Correct recombinant clones were selected by the
blue/white colony selection method using X-gal and
IPTG. Plasmid DNA was extracted using the AtmanBio
plasmid purification kit (Takara Co., Japan), which was
used for all subsequent sequencing reactions.
Sequencing and sequence analysis
Both strands of the purified plasmid DNA were sequenced
using a primer-walking strategy. The sequencing reactions
were performed using the dideoxy-nucleotide termination
method with the big-dye terminator system and an
ABI3700 model automatic sequencer. The complete pycnogonid mitochondrial genome [GenBank: AY457170]
was annotated using several stand-alone programs including Clustal X [63] and GeneJockey II v. 1.6 (Biosoft Inc.,
UK) and the BLAST web-based program. Thirteen proteincoding genes and two rRNA genes were identified by their
sequence similarities to previously published genes.
Potential secondary structures of 18 of the 22 tRNAs were
identified using tRNAscan-SE v. 1.1 [64], and those of the
other 4 by eye (trnA, trnS2, trnY and trnV).

Methods
Specimen collection and DNA extraction
The pycnogonid A. bituberculata was collected from the
intertidal zone of the East Sea (Pohang) in Korea. This
specimen was immediately fixed in 70% ethanol and
brought to our laboratory where it was preserved in absolute ethanol and stored at -20°C. The specimen was
washed with distilled water, and total cellular DNA was
extracted from a single individual using the DNeasy Tissue
Kit (QIAGEN Co., Germany).
PCR amplification and cloning
The entire mitochondrial genome was amplified by two
polymerase chain reactions (PCR) using the following
previously-reported primers: 16SB 5'-CCG GTT GAA CTC
AGA TCA-3' [60] and HCO2198 5'-TAA ACT TCA GGG
TGA CCA AAA AAT-3' [61] for 11 kb amplification, and
16SA 5'-CGC CTG TTT ATC AAA AAC AT-3' [62] and
LCO1490 5'-GGT CAA CAA ATC ATA AAG ATA TTG G-3'
[61] for 5 kb amplification. PCR amplification was performed using the Expand High Fidelity PCR Kit (Roche
Co., Germany). The PCR protocol was as follows: 1 cycle

Phylogenetic analysis
For the present phylogenetic analyses we employed 30
arthropod ingroup taxa and 4 outgroup taxa, as listed in
Table 1. The amino acid sequences of the 13 protein-coding genes were used. The 13 multiple alignment subsets of
these sequences were created using a Clustal X multiple
alignment program [63] under the default option. Only
well-aligned, conserved alignment sites were extracted
from each alignment subset using the Gblock program
[65] with the default option. The atp8 gene was excluded
from the following analyses because it is very variable in
sequence and too short in length, so no region was
selected by the Gblock program. The extracted conserved
blocks were subsequently concatenated into a unified,
single large alignment set with the Gblock program. Phylogenetic analyses inferred from nucleotide sequences are
not presented because the resultant trees are unresolved in
deep branches in spite of removing 3rd-codon positions. It
is likely that amino acid sequences are considered more
appropriate for resolving deep branching patterns in this
study.

The refined alignment (2232 aa positions in length) was
subjected to two different tree-making algorithms: the
maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI)
methods. Rather than using hierarchical likelihood ratio
tests to select the best fitting model for the evolution of
sequences, and to calculate the related parameter values (I
and Γ), ProtTest ver. 1.3 [66] was used under Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) because it has several important
advantages [67]. Among the 36 models implemented in
this program, the best-fitting model selected was mtREV
[68] with among-site substitution-rate heterogeneity
described by a gamma distribution (Γ = 0.86) and a fraction of sites constrained to be invariable (I = 0.19). The
ML analysis was carried out using PHYML v2.4.4 [69]. The
bootstrap proportions (BPML; 100 replicates) of the ML
tree were obtained by the fast-ML method using PHYML.
BI analysis was carried out using the MrBayes v3.0b4 program [70] with the following options: 1,000,000 generations, 8 chains (2 hot and 6 cold) and a burn-in step of the
first 50,000. Node confidence values of the BI tree were
presented with Bayesian posterior probabilities (BPP). We
applied bootstrap re-sampling procedures to the Bayesian
approach since it is known that posterior probabilities
place excessive confidence on a given phylogenetic
hypothesis. Bayesian bootstrap proportions (BPBI) were
calculated as follows: 100 bootstrapped datasets were generated with the SEQBOOT program under the PHYLIP
package Version 3.6b [71], and then each dataset was analyzed by MrBayes v3.0b4 [70], with four independent
Markov chains run for 500,000 Metropolis-coupled
MCMC generations, with tree sampling every 100 generations and a burn-in of 10,000 trees. Finally, the 100 Bayesian majority rule consensus trees were used to construct
the BBP consensus tree with the CONSENSUS program
using the PHYLIP package Version 3.6b [71].

dataset (log likelihood value = -41668.552731); (D) 13 arthropod taxa
– additional removal of N. gracile from the (C) dataset (log likelihood
value = -40520.848760). The numbers above the branches are the node
confidence values obtained with 100 bootstrap replicates. The PhyML program was used to reconstruct the ML trees. In (A) and (B), an onychophoran, Epiperipatus biolleyi, is used as an outgroup, and in (C) and
