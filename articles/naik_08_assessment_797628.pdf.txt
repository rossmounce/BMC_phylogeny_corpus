Abstract
Background: Phosphorus is an essential macronutrient for the growth of plants. However, in
most soils a large portion of phosphorus becomes insoluble and therefore, unavailable to plants.
Knowledge on biodiversity of phosphate-solubilizing fluorescent pseudomonads is essential to
understand their ecological role and their utilization in sustainable agriculture.
Results: Of 443 fluorescent pseudomonad strains tested, 80 strains (18%) showed positive for the
solubilization of tri-calcium phosphate (Ca3(PO4)2) by the formation of visible dissolution halos on
Pikovskaya's agar. These phosphate solubilizing strains showed high variability in utilizing various
carbon sources. Numerical taxonomy of the phosphate solubilizing strains based on their carbon
source utilization profiles resulted into three major phenons at a 0.76 similarity coefficient level.
Genotypic analyses of strains by BOX (bacterial repetitive BOX element)-polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) resulted into three distinct genomic clusters and 26 distinct BOX profiles at a 80%
similarity level. On the basis of phenotypic characterization and 16S rRNA gene phylogenetic
analyses strains were identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. mosselii, P. monteilii, P. plecoglossicida,
P. putida, P. fulva and P. fluorescens. These phosphate solubilizing strains also showed the production
of plant growth promoting enzymes, hormones and exhibited antagonism against phytopathogenic
fungi that attack on various crops. Gene specific primers have identified the putative antibiotic
producing strains. These putative strains were grown in fermentation media and production of
antibiotics was confirmed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and high performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC).
Conclusion: Present study revealed a high degree of functional and genetic diversity among the
phosphate solubilizing fluorescent pseudomonad bacteria. Due to their innate potential of
producing an array of plant growth promoting enzymes, hormones and antifungal metabolites these
phosphate solubilizing strains are considered to play a vital role in plant growth promotion, disease
suppression and subsequent enhancement of yield.

Background
Phosphorous deficiency is a major constraint to crop production. Plants absorb only inorganic form of phosphorous and the level of inorganic phosphorus is very low in
the soil because most of the phosphorous is present as
insoluble forms. Agricultural soils possess considerable
accumulation of phosphorous due to the regular excessive
applications of chemical fertilizers. The overuse of chemicals and chemical fertilizers has led to the lethal consequences to useful arthropods and other beneficial
microbes as well as led to soil pollution. A large proportion of these fertilizers added to the soil are also converted
to insoluble form and become unavailable to plants [1].
Microorganisms have the ability to solubilize the insoluble phosphates and maintain the soil health and quality
[2]. Bacteria use several direct and indirect mechanisms of
action to improve plant growth and health. Mechanisms
such as phosphate solubilization [3], aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase [4], nitrogen cycle
[5] and phytohormone production [6] are considered as
popular mechanisms. Beneficial effects of phosphate solubilizing bacteria to crops have been documented well
[1,7,8]. It is believed that microbial solubilization of
phosphate in soil was correlated with the ability of
microbes in producing selected organic acids and or extracellular polysaccharides [3,9]. This hypothesis has been
corroborated by cloning pyrroloquinoline (PQQ) synthase [10-12] and gabY genes involved in gluconic acid
production. Gluconic acid is the principal organic acid
produced due to direct oxidation of glucose by Pseudomonas which was found to be involved in phosphate
solubilization [13].
Among phosphate solubilizing bacteria, fluorescent pseudomonads that colonize aggressively the plant roots have
been considered as an important group of bacteria due to
their biofertilizing and biocontrol properties. In many
occasions, plant growth promoting rhizobacteria often
exhibit the production of antimicrobial metabolites,
which take part in suppression of diseases caused by soilborne phytopathogens [6,14,15] as well as involve in the
induction of systemic resistance against insects and nematodes [16-18]. Selective strains of fluorescent pseudomonad bacteria have also been reported for
biodegradation of agricultural pollutants [15,19] as well
as for weed control in agricultural fields [20-22]. These
bacteria have been considered as an important bioinoculants due to their innate potential to produce plant growth
promoting hormones and enzymes [6,16,23-25]. Though
the bacteria belonging to Mesorhizobium, Rhizobium, Klebsiella, Acinetobacter, Enterobacter, Erwinia, Achrobacter,
Micrococcus, Aerobacter and Bacillus have been reported as
phosphate solubilizers, strains belong to pseudomonads
are considered as efficient phosphate solubilizers [26].

Rice and banana are most important food crops of the
world and are widely grown in developing countries. Fungal pathogens are important production constraints of
rice, banana and other crops. Indiscriminate use of fungicides in agriculture is known to be hazardous to the environment and lethal toward other beneficial organisms; it
can lead to the development of resistance against target
organisms. Microbial solubilization of phosphorus, biodegradaton of chemical pollutants and biocontrol of
plant pathogens are cost-effective, novel biological restoration and ecofriendly techniques. Considering the multiple applications of phosphate solubilizing fluorescent
pseudomonads it is essential to study their diversity,
which will be useful in designing strategies to use these
native strains as bioinoculants for sustainable and organic
agriculture without causing harm to the environment and
farmers. The objective of the present investigation was to
study the genetic and functional diversity of phosphate
solubilizing fluorescent pseudomonads associated with
rhizospheric soils of rice and banana by an array of in vitro
assays, gene amplification techniques, fermentation
methods and chromatographic analyses. Taxonomic affiliation of bacteria was done on the basis of 16S rRNA gene
similarity and molecular phylogenetic analyses.

Methods
Isolation of fluorescent pseudomonad strains
Rhizospheric soil samples of rice (Oryza sativa L.) and
banana (Musa spp. AAA) were collected from agricultural
fields located at Puducherry, India. Samples were stored at
4°C before being processed within 24 h of collection. The
soil was sand clay loam and its characteristics were as follows; pH 7.3, 74 μg g-1 nitrogen, 2.9 μg g-1 phosphorus,
5.29 μg g-1 potassium, 0.2 mOhms cm-1 of electrical conductivity (EC). Isolation of fluorescent pseudomonad
bacteria from rhizospheric soil was performed as
described earlier [25]. Briefly, soil suspension was
obtained by shaking 10 g of soil sample having roots with
tightly adhering soil in 90 ml of 0.1 M MgSO4.7H2O
buffer for 10 min at 180 rpm on a rotary shaker. Resulting
suspensions were serially diluted and 0.1 ml aliquots of
each dilution were spread onto King's medium B (KB)
agar in triplicates. After incubation at 28°C for 2 days, fluorescent pseudomonad colonies from replicate plates
were identified under UV light (366 nm). Purified single
colonies were further streaked onto KB agar plates to
obtain pure cultures. Stock cultures were made in Luria
Bertani (LB) broth containing 50% (w/v) glycerol and
stored at -86°C.
Screening of phosphate solubilizers and estimation of
phosphate solubilization
To detect the phosphate solubilizing bacteria, strains were
streaked onto Pikovskaya's agar medium, which contains
(per liter): 0.5 g yeast extract, 10 g dextrose, 5 g Ca3(PO4)2,

BMC Microbiology 2008, 8:230

0.5 g (NH4)2SO4, 0.2 g KCl, 0.1 g MgSO4.7H2O, 0.0001 g
MnSO4.H2O, 0.0001 g FeSO4.7H2O and 15 g agar. After 3
days of incubation at 28°C, strains that induced clear
zone around the colonies were considered as positive
[27]. Determination of phosphate solubilizing activity by
the strains was carried out following standard method
[28]. Briefly, cells were grown in liquid medium (pH 7.0)
at 28°C up to 10 days and on 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 day an aliquot of 5 ml was collected and cells were removed by centrifugation at 9,000 g for 20 min. Soluble free phosphate
in culture supernatant was estimated from the absorbance
values obtained using the calibration curve with KH2PO4
at 600 nm for each strain. Also, pH variation in Pikovskaya's medium during the growth of each strain was
also observed.
Phenotypic characterization of phosphate solubilizing
bacteria
In order to determine the phenotypic diversity of 80 phosphate solubilizing bacteria characterization was done on
the basis of fluorescence on King's B (KB) medium, levan
formation, gelatin liquefaction, nitrate reduction and
growth at 4°C and 42°C [29,30]. In order to identify fluorescence of the strains, overnight grown cells on KB agar
medium were visualized under UV light (366 nm).
Gram's reaction was determined by the KOH technique
[31]. Briefly, visible amount of overnight grown cells from
agar plate was smeared (1–2 cm2 area) onto glass slide
containing loopful (3 mm) of 3% aqueous KOH solution.
Gram negative strains were identified as viscous gel that
string out along with the loop. To test the presence of cytochrome oxidase, bacterial culture grown for 24 h on nutrient agar (NA) supplemented with 1% glucose was used. A
loopful cells were rubbed onto a filter paper impregnated
with 1% (wt/vol) aqueous N,N,N',N'-tetra-methyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride solution. A change in the
color of the cultures to deep purple within 10 s was registered as a positive result. Presence of arginine dihydrolase
and levan sucrase was tested on Thornley's medium and
NA supplemented with arginine and sucrose (20 g l-1),
respectively [29].

Carbon utilization profiles were tested using Hicarbohydrate™ kit as descried by the manufacturer (Himedia Laboratories, Mumbai, India). Cells were grown in nutrient
broth to reach density of 0.5 O.D. at 600 nm. An aliquot
of 50 μl of this suspension was inoculated to each well of
Hicarbohydrate™ kit, incubated at 30°C for 24 h and the
results were registered according to the instructions of the
manufacturer. The experiment was done with three replicates. On the basis of data derived from the carbon source
utilization profiles, a matrix with binary code composing
positive (1) and negative (0) values was made. SIMQUAL
program was used to compute the symmetric matrix in the
form of average taxonomic distances. Sequential, agglom-

erative, hierarchical and nested (SAHN) clustering was
used for the cluster analyses [32]. Dendrogram was constructed from the similarity matrix by the unweighted pair
group with mathematical averages (UPGMA) using
NTSYS-pc2.02a (Exeter software, New York, USA) numerical taxonomy and multivariate analysis system.
BOX-PCR based genotypic analysis
Bacteria were cultured in LB broth at 28°C for 18 h and
the total genomic DNA was extracted as described [25].
The BOX-A1R (5'-CTACGGCAAGGCGACGCTGACG-3')
primer for genotypic analysis [33] was synthesized by
Integrated DNA Technologies Inc. (Coralville, IA, USA).
PCR reaction (50 μl) contained 50 pM of primer, 50 ng of
genomic DNA, 1× Taq DNA polymerase buffer, 1 U of Taq
DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI), 0.2 mM of
each deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP), and 1.5 mM
MgCl2. Amplification was performed in a DNA thermal
cycler (2400 cycler, Perkin Elmer International, Rotkreuz,
Switzerland) programmed with an initial denaturation at
95°C for 7 min, 30 cycles at 94°C for 1 min, 53°C for 1
min, and 65°C for 8 min, with an extension at 65°C for
15 min. A 10 μl of PCR product was separated using 1.5%
agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide in 1× tris acetate ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (TAE). The image of
the gel was digitized by using BIO-CAPT system (Vilber
Lourmat, France) and stored as TIFF files. BOX-PCR band
profiles were detected by QuantityOne program (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, CA, USA). Computer assisted analysis of
genomic fingerprints was performed by using the BIOGENE software program v11.02 (Vilber Lourmat, France).
Similarity matrices of whole densitometric curves of the
gels tracks were calculated by using the Dice coefficient.
Cluster analysis of similarity matrices was performed by
the un-weighted pair group with mathematical average
(UPGMA) algorithm.
16S rRNA gene amplification, sequencing and
phylogenetic tree analysis
Amplification of 16S rRNA gene was performed from the
genomic DNA of strains using universal primers fD1 (5'GAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCA-3') and rP2 (5'-ACGGCTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3') [34]. PCR cocktails (50 μl) contained 50 pM of primer, 50 ng of genomic DNA, 1× Taq
DNA polymerase buffer, 1 U of Taq DNA polymerase
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA), 0.2 mM of each dNTP, and
1.5 mM MgCl2. Amplification was performed in a DNA
thermo cycler (2400 cycler, Perkin Elmer International,
Rotkreuz, Switzerland) at 94°C for 3 min, followed by 30
cycles of 10 s at 94°C, 1 min at 56°C and 30 s at 72°C
with an extension of 72°C for 5 min. A 5 μl aliquot of
each amplification product was electrophoresed on a
0.7% agarose gel in 1× TAE buffer at 50 V for 45 min,
stained with ethidium bromide and the PCR products
were visualised with a UV transilluminator. PCR products

were purified using Quick PCR purification column
(Promega, Madison, USA). Purified PCR products were
sequenced with automated DNA sequencer with specific
primers using the facility at Macrogen Inc. (Seoul, Korea).
To perform molecular phylogenetic analyses, reference
sequences required for comparison were downloaded
from the EMBL database using the site http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank. All the sequences of
16S rRNA were aligned using the multiple sequence alignment program CLUSTAL W [35]. The aligned sequences
were then checked for gaps manually, arranged in a block
of 600 bp in each row [36] and saved as molecular evolutionary genetics analysis (MEGA) format in software
MEGA v3.0. The pair wise evolutionary distances were
computed using the Kimura 2-parameter model [37]. To
obtain the confidence values, the original data set was
resampled 1000 times using the bootstrap analysis
method. The bootstrapped data set was used directly for
constructing the phylogenetic tree using the MEGA v3.0
program for calculating the multiple distance matrixes
[38]. The multiple distance matrix obtained was then used
to construct phylogenetic trees using neighbor-joining
(NJ) method [39].
Nucleotide sequence accession numbers
The nucleotide sequences of 16S rRNA were deposited in
GenBank. The accession numbers of the 16S rRNA nucleotide sequences of the strains are presented in Additional
file 1.
Production of other plant growth promoting enzymes and
hormones
Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)
Production of IAA was determined following the standard
method [40]. Briefly, overnight grown single colony was
streaked onto LB medium agar, which contains (per liter):
10 g tryptone, 5 g yeast extract, 5 g NaCl, 15 g agar
amended with 5 mM L-tryptophan, 0.06% sodium
dodecyl sulphate and 1% glycerol. Plates were overlaid
with sterile Whatman no. 1 filter paper (82 mm diameter)
and bacterial strain was allowed to grow for 3 days at
28°C. After incubation, the paper was removed and
treated with Salkowski's reagent [41] having the formulation of 2% of 0.5 M ferric chloride in 35% perchloric acid
at room temperature for 60 min. In a Petri dish, the filter
papers were saturated by soaking in Salkowski's reagent
and the production of IAA was identified by the formation
of a red halo on the paper immediately surrounding the
colony.
Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase
The ACC deaminase activity was determined as described
earlier [16] on Dworkin and Foster (DF) minimal salts
medium, which contains (per liter): 4 g KH2PO4, 6 g
Na2HPO4, 0.2 g MgSO4.7H2O, 2 g glucose, 0.2 g; 2 g glu-

conic acid and 2 mg citric acid with trace element solution
(1 mg FeSO4.7H2O, 10 μg H3BO3, 11.19 μg MnSO4.H2O,
124.6 μg ZnSO4.7H2O, 78.22 μg CuSO4.5H2O and 10 μg
MoO3). Filter sterilized ACC solution (3 mM) was spread
over the agar plates, allowed to dry for 10 min and inoculated with bacterial strains. Observation of the growth
made after 2 days incubation at 28°C as described earlier
[4].
Siderophore
Production of siderophore by the strains was determined
using the FeCl3 test and the chrome azurol S agar assay.
Briefly, inoculum (10 μl) of bacterial strains dropped
onto the center of a CAS plate. After incubation at 25°C
for 3 days, siderophore production was assessed on the
basis of change in color of the medium from blue to
orange [42-44].
Production of fungal cell wall degrading enzymes
Protease
The protease activity was determined using skim milk agar
medium, which contains (per liter): 5 g pancreatic digest
of casein, 2.5 g yeast extract, 1 g glucose, 7% skim milk
solution and 15 g of agar. Bacterial cells were spot inoculated and after 2 days incubation at 28°C proteolytic
activity was identified by clear zone around the cells [45].
Chitinase
The chitinase activity of strains was tested on chitin agar
medium, which contains (per liter): 1.62 g nutrient broth,
0.5 g NaCl, 6 g M9 salts, 8 g colloidal chitin and 15 g agar.
Bacterial cells were spot inoculated and after 5 days incubation at 30°C, chitinase activity was identified by clear
zone around the cells [17].
Production of other beneficial enzymes
Cellulase
Strains were screened for cellulase production by plating
onto M9 medium agar amended with 10 g of cellulose
and 1.2 g of yeast extract per liter. After 8 days of incubation at 28°C, colonies surrounded by clear halos were
considered positive for cellulase production [23].
Pectinase
Pectinase production was determined using M9 medium
amended with 4.8 g of pectin per liter. After 2 days of incubation at 28°C, plates were flooded with 2 mol l-1 HCl
and strains surrounded by clear halos were considered
positive for pectinase production [23].
Test for antagonism
Strains were tested for in vitro antagonism towards fungal
pathogens by following standard co-inoculation technique on potato dextrose agar (PDA) [36,46]. Fungal phytopathogens, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense FOC

UV irradiation at 254 nm [48]. PLT spots were detected by
spraying with an aqueous 0.5% (wt/vol) Fast Blue RR salt
solution 0.5% (wt/vol) and the PRN spots were detected
by spraying the TLC plates with 2% p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde dissolved in the ethanol-sulfuric acid (1:1 vol/
vol). Detection and quantitative determination of antibiotics was done by analytical HPLC (Shimadzu, Kyoto,
Japan) as described [36]. Production of hydrogen cyanide
(HCN) was determined by growing bacteria on KB agar
medium supplemented with 4.4 g l-1 glycine. A piece of filter paper impregnated with picric acid and sodium carbonate (0.5% and 2%, respectively) was placed in the lid
of each Petri dish. Petri dish was sealed with parafilm and
incubated at 28°C for 96 h. The production of cyanide
was identified by the change in the color of filter paper
from yellow to orange-brown [47].

Results
Isolation and screening of phosphate solubilizing bacteria
and estimation of phosphate solubilization
Of the 443 strains, 80 strains (18%) produced phosphate
solubilization on Pikovskaya's agar medium by inducing
clear zones (Fig. 1). The solubilization of tri-calcium
phosphate was estimated for all strains. Soluble phosphate was estimated to be 29 to 105 μg ml-1 on 10 days of
inoculation. A significant reduction in pH of Pikovskaya's
liquid medium from pH 7.4 to pH 4.8 was observed on 10
days of incubation [See Additional file 2].

Phenotypic characterization of phosphate solubilizing
bacteria
Out of 443 fluorescent pseudomonad strains tested, 80
strains showed phosphate solubilization potential. These
phosphate solubilizing strains were Gram-negative,
motile, rod shaped and tested positive for cytochrome
oxidase, arginine dihydrolase, strains showed variability
for traits such as gelatin hydrolysis, levan production and
growth at 4°C and 42°C. All phosphate solubilizing
strains utilized dextrose, galactose, mannose and citrate
but exhibited varying degree of utilization towards other
carbon sources such as lactose, xylose, fructose, melibiose,
L-arabinose, glycerol, ribose, α-methyl-D-mannoside, xylitol, esculin, D-arabinose, malonate, sorbose, trehalose,
sorbitol, mannitol, adonitol and glucosamine. These
strains did not utilize maltose, sucrose, inulin, salicin,
dulcitol, inositol, α-methyl-D-gluconate, rhamnose, cellobiose, melazitose, xylitol and ONPG. Numerical analysis of phenotypic characteristics revealed a high degree of
polymorphism. All phosphate solubilizing strains were
grouped into 3 major phenons at 0.76 similarity coefficient level (Fig. 2). The similarity coefficient range among
phosphate solubilizing strains was 0.57 to 1.00. Phenons
I, II and III consist a total of 61, 3 and 16 strains, respectively.
BOX-PCR based genotypic analysis
The cluster analysis based on the pair-wise coefficient similarity with UPGMA of BOX-PCR resulted into 3 distinct
genomic clusters and at a 80% similarity coefficient generated 26 distinct BOX profiles (Fig. 3). A total of 20
strains were grouped into cluster I which shared 40% similarity with other strains. Cluster III consisted of 2 strains
and a large number of strains grouped in cluster II comprising 58 strains. All the strains showed wide variations
in fingerprinting pattern due to their high degree of
genetic variability and distributed into different clusters.
On the basis of these results, present study identified a
high degree of genetic variability among different species
of phosphate solubilizing fluorescent pseudomonads.

P. mosselii and P. aeruginosa were identified. Phylogenetic
analyses of the 80 fluorescent pseudomonad strains based
on the NJ method with 1000 bootstrap sampling were
resulted into 3 major clusters (Fig. 4). Of the 80 strains,
cluster I formed with 58 strains, cluster II formed with 8
strains and cluster III formed with 14 strains. A total of 36
strains belong to P. monteilii, 10 strains belong to P. plecoglossicida, 12 strains belong to P. putida, 7 strains belong

(See Additional file 1; Fig. 4).
Production of plant growth promoting enzymes, hormones
and fungal cell wall degrading enzymes
All the strains tested positive for the production of
siderophore on the basis of change in colour of the CAS
medium from blue to orange. Of the 80 phosphate solubilizing strains, 39 strains (49%) showed positive for the
production of plant growth-promoting hormone, IAA.
The ACC deaminase was observed in 13 strains (16%) by
their growth on Dworking and Foster (DF) minimal
medium containing ACC. Of the 80 strains, 22 strains
(28%) showed proteolytic activity by inducing clear zones
around the cells on skim milk agar medium, 7 strains
(9%) showed chitinase activity by inducing clear zones
around the cells on chitin agar medium, 33 strains (41%)
produced pectinase and 25 strains (31%) produced cellulase [See Additional file 1].
Test for antagonism
Of the 80 phosphate solubilizing strains, 33 strains (41%)
showed antifungal activity towards phytopathogenic
fungi used in the study [See Additional file 3]. Strains
induced growth-free inhibition zones (diameter) ranging
from 10 to 36 mm towards phytopathogenic fungi.
Screening of putative antibiotic producing strains by PCR
Genomic DNA of strains when tested as templates using
gene-specific primers, 12 strains (FPB16, FPB17, FPB51,
FP2, FP3, FP5, FP7 FP10, FP14, Pw70, Pw71 and Pw72)
amplified the DNA fragment of 745-bp of DAPG, 10
strains (FPB15, FPB16, FPB74, FPB75, FP2, FP3, FP5, FP7,
FP14 and FP15) amplified the DNA fragment of 719-bp of
PRN, 6 strains (FP2, FP3, FP5, FP7, FP9 and FP14) amplified DNA fragment of 779-bp of PLT and 6 strains (FPB18,
FPB52, FPB75, Pw60, Pw61 and FP15) amplified DNA
fragment of 1,150-bp of PCA (C, D).
Production quantitative determination of antifungal
metabolites
The putative antibiotic strains identified by PCR were subjected to fermentation and antifungal metabolites such as
DAPG (yellowish white), PCA (greenish yellow), PRN
(light yellow) and PLT (yellowish white) were detected in
the production cultures. TLC and HPLC analyses confirmed the production of PCA, DAPG, PLT and PRN by the
strains. The retardation factor (Rf) values were found to be
0.77 for DAPG, 0.53 for PCA, 0.80 for PRN, 0.50 for PLT
as determined by co-migration with pure standards.
Strains grown in fermentation cultures yielded PCA (20 to
1124 μg ml-1), DAPG (13 to 93 μg ml-1), PLT (3 to 9 μg
ml-1) and PRN (3 to 41 μg ml-1). HPLC analyses of active
fractions of antibiotics yielded similar retention time to
that of the standard antibiotics. PCA was detected at 257

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/230

nm with a retention time 4.94 min, DAPG was detected at
270 nm with a retention time 10.77 min, PLT was
detected at 255 nm with a retention time of 17.6 min and
PRN was detected at 220 nm with a retention time of 27.5
min. Of the 80 strains, 20 strains (25%) produced HCN
[See Additional file 1].

Discussion
Phosphorus is considered as an essential macronutrient
and a great portion of phosphorus from chemical fertilizers becomes insoluble by its conversion into calcium or
magnesium salts in soils and become unavailable to
plants. Soil microorganisms involve to transform the
insoluble forms of phosphorus into soluble forms and
thus influence the subsequent availability of phosphate to
plant roots are considered essential [49,50]. Phosphate
solubilizing microorganisms have been employed in agriculture and horticulture and have been considered very
important due to their potential of ecological amelioration. It is believed that microbial mediated solubilization
of insoluble phosphates in soil is through the release of
organic acids microbial metabolites [51-53]. However, in
addition to acid production, other mechanisms can cause
phosphate solubilization [54]. Phosphate solubilization
has been reported to depend on the structural complexicity and particle size of phosphates and the quantity of
organic acid secreted by microbes [55].
Fluorescent pseudomonads often predominant among
plant rhizosphere associated bacteria [24,56]. Plant
growth promoting rhizobacteria are classified into two
different groups such as strains that have the capability of
synthesizing phytohormones and strains that have the
ability to suppress the growth of phytopathogens [57].
Fluorescent pseudomonads enhance plant growth by
improving soil nutrient status, producing plant growth
hormones, enzymes and suppressing the growth of phytopathogenic fungi [56,58]. Plant growth promoting
rhizobacterial types of fluorescent pseudomonads use one
or more mechanisms of direct or indirect in improving
plant growth. These mechanisms can probably be active
simultaneously or sequentially at different stages of plant
growth. This group of bacteria exhibits multiple functional traits such as solubilizing of inorganic phosphate
and iron, production of vitamins, phytohormones and
antimicrobial metabolites. They are capable of improving
plant nutrients uptake, tolerance to stress, salinity, metal
toxicity and pesticide. Fluorescent pseudomonad strains
such as P. fluorescens NJ101 [14], P. fluorescens EM85 [59],
P. fluorescens [60], Pseudomonas spp. [61,62], P. chlororaphis, P. savastanoi, P. pickettii [23] and P. corrugata [63]
have been reported as phosphate solubilizers.
In the present investigation, out of 443 fluorescent pseudomonad strains screened, 80 strains have been identified

Page 10 of 14

BMC Microbiology 2008, 8:230

as phosphate solubilizers. These strains were taxonomically described as different fluorescent pseudomonad species such as P. monteilli, P. putida, P. plecoglossicida, P.
fluoresens, P. fulva, P. monteilli and P. aeruginosa on the
basis of 16S rRNA gene sequencing and subsequent
molecular phylogeny analysis. Phenotypic analyses as
well as 16S rRNA and BOX-PCR based genotypic analyses
revealed a high degree of diversity among phosphate solubilizing bacteria reported in this study. Significant
decline in the pH of the culture medium by strains was
observed during mineral phosphate solubilization, which
suggested the microbial production of organic acids [64].
Although phosphate solubilization is not necessarily correlated with acidity, from the data present in this study
relationship could be ascertained between the acidity of
medium and the release of soluble phosphates. Estimation of phosphate solubilization of strains by other methods has been reported to be between 200 to 805 μg ml-1
[65]. In an earlier study, P. fluorescens strain NJ-101 isolated from agricultural soil was reported to release 74.6 μg
ml-1 soluble phosphate from inorganic phosphate [14]
and in the present study, up to 105.3 μg ml-1 soluble phosphate was estimated. We have found that 49% of the
strains produced IAA and 16% of the strains produced
ACC deaminase. It is reported that the ACC deaminase
producing bacteria increase root elongation and seed germination by lowering plant ethylene levels [24,66]. Specific strains of fluorescent pseudomonad bacteria
indirectly influence the plant health by preventing the deleterious effects of phytopathogenic microorganisms
through the production of antibiotics, cell wall degrading
enzymes, HCN metabolite and siderophores [56,57]. Production of HCN by P. fluorescens CHAO was recognized as
a biocontrol factor, against plant pathogenic fungi [67].
Production of antibiotics by fluorescent pseudomonads
considered important in suppression of phytopathogens.
Recently, P. aeruginosa PUPa3, a new strain from rice
rhizosphere with potential for fungal antibiosis and biofertilizing traits has been identified from our laboratory
[25]. All the strains reported in this study produced
hydroxamate siderophores as evidenced on FeCl3
amended CAS agar medium, production of an array of
phytohormones and antifungal metabolites. Microbial
production of antibiotics, PCA (2 to 3 mg ml-1), DAPG
(0.5 to 3 mg ml-1), PLT (1.5 to 2 μg ml-1) and PRN (0.54
mg ml-1) by biofertilizing and biocontrol strains have
been reported in earlier studies [68-70]. In the present
study the production of PCA (20 to 1124 μg ml-1), DAPG
(13 to 93 μg ml-1), PLT (3 to 9 μg ml-1) and PRN (3 to 41
μg ml-1) by phosphate solubilizing fluorescent pseudomonads has been reported. Strain efficiency and variations in the fermentation conditions often result in an
alteration in antibiotic production. Considering the quantity of antibiotics by plant growth promoting and biocon-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/230

trol strains of fluorescent pseduomonads reported by
other inverstigators [68-70], strains reported in this study
may be considered as non-pathogenic to plants and antagonistic bacteria against phytopathogenic fungi. Strains
reported in this study utilized several carbon sources as
identified by Hi-carbohydrate™ kit test. Utilization of variety of carbon sources by the strains may play an important
role in adapting to a variety of crop plants and soil types.
The IAA hormone is known to have dual role in influencing plant growth, by involving in the biocontrol together
with glutathione-s-transferases in defense-related plant
reactions and inhibits the germination of spore and
growth of mycelium of different pathogenic fungi [71,72].
Martinez Noel et al. (2001) showed that the IAA supply to
excised potato leaves reduced the severity of the disease
provoked by Phytophthora infestans [73]. In present investigation, we have identified the spectrum of bacterial
antagonism by measuring the inhibition zones of mycelial radial growth in plate assays. These antagonistic
strains also showed production of IAA, fungal cell wall
degrading enzymes, such as cellulases, proteases and chitinases which are known to be involved in antagonistic
activity against phytopathogenic fungi and insects
[74,75]. Selective microbial producers of chitinase are also
reported to be the efficient phosphate solubilizers [76].
Phosphate solubilizing fluorescent pseudomonad strains
reported in this study may solubilize insoluble compounds due to the excretion of organic acids. Production
of antimicrobial metabolites and organic acids is essential
to decrease soil pH, which plays a major role in solubilization of phosphates and other nutrients.
Characterization of phosphate solubilizing fluorescent
pseudomonad bacteria is required to study their ecological role in soil. Fluorescent pseudomonad strains reported
in this study with phosphate solubilization potential and
ability to excrete phytohormones and antimicrobial
metabolites may be used as plant growth promoting bacteria and biocontrol agents in sustainable agriculture.

Conclusion
Phosphate solubilizing fluorescent pseudomonad bacterial strains with their multifunctional properties will
attract more attention in the field of biofertilization and
biological control. Present investigation revealed the
microbial diversity of fluorescent pseudomonads with
innate potential of mineralizing phosphate, plant growth
promoting traits and biocontrol properties. Knowledge
generated on biodiversity of phosphate solubilizing bacteria will be useful to design strategies to use these strains
as inoculants in sustainable and organic agriculture.
