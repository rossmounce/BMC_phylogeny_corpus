AutoantibodiesC. burnetiiQ fever.

Abstract
Recent reports have shown that some of the immunological aspects of Q fever, a rickettsiosis
caused by Coxiella burnetii, could be related to self-antigen responses. The aim of this study was to
determine the specificity of the autoantibody response of patients with acute and chronic Coxiella
infections. Smooth muscle and cardiac muscle-specific autoantibodies were observed in significant
percentages in acutely or chronically affected Q fever patients when compared to healthy
volunteers. Moreover, the incidence of cardiac muscle-specific autoantibody was significantly higher
among chronically ill patients compared to acutely ill patients. Moreover, a band of 50 kD of a HeLa
extract was detected in most of the sera of individuals with chronic infections and previous
sequence analysis suggests that this antigen presents a high degree of homology with the human
actin elongation factor 1 alpha. Further research would be necessary to confirm if antibodies to
human cytoskeletal proteins could be of clinical importance in chronically infected Q fever patients.

Background
Q fever is a worldwide distributed human rickettsiosis
that was described by Derrick in 1937. Burnett in Australia
and Cox in the United States first isolated its etiological
agent almost simultaneously so it was referred to as Coxiella burnetii [1,2]. Q fever infection is usually asymptomatic or acute self-limited but Coxiella is an intracellular
bacterium that may persist within host macrophages leading to chronic complications such as endocarditis, hepatitis, meningitis, bone infections or chronic fatigue

syndrome [3-6]. Diagnosis of Q fever is usually based on
serological procedures because isolation of the bacterium
is difficult and hazardous and requires level 3 biosafety
laboratories [7]. Unique to Coxiella is its antigenic phase
variation that appears to involve changes on lipopolyssacharide [2,4,8]. Virulent phase I bacteria are isolated from
natural infection while avirulent phase II occurs after
serial passages. Although the factors that determine the
clinical presentation of Q fever are still not well understood, variation in C. burnetii strains, route of infection,

host immunity and size of the inoculum have been implicated in disease evolution [2,4,5].
Autoimmune diseases are defined as the pathologic
sequelae of autoimmune responses. The precise mechanisms by which they are induced are still under discussion, but genetic, hormonal and environmental factors
have all been implicated [9,10]. The idea that infectious
agents may represent one of the major environmental factors initiating autoimmune responses is now generally
accepted and the mechanisms of induction are currently
being re-examined [11-13]. Intracellular microorganisms,
particularly those associated with persistent or latent
infection, have developed strategies to modulate immune
responses and hence survive within host cells [14]. Under
these circumstances, these microorganisms would not
only initiate but also sustain an anomalous reaction that
would lead to the appearance of autoimmune features in
predisposed patients. Molecular homology with host
sequences, polyclonal stimulation of B and T clones,
cytokine stimulation, over expression of major histocompatibility complex molecules (MHC II), antigen modification and host cell damage with the release of self-antigens,
are the most commonly described mechanisms that could
lead to autoimmune responses due to infectious agents
[11,13,15-17]. Links between autoimmunity and infection have been described in several situations, as in the
case of myocarditis following coxsackievirus and trypanosomal infections [18-20], rheumatic fever in relation to
streptococci [21], ankylosing spondylitis and klebsiella

[22], reactive arthropathies and Epstein Barr viruses
[23,24] and recently heart disease and chlamydia [25].
Direct evidence that confirms the diagnosis of autoimmune diseases requires test that are still beyond the capacity of most clinical laboratories so autoimmune disease
diagnosis is frequently based on circumstantial evidence
[26], such as the demonstration and quantitation of the
various autoantibodies.
In Q fever patients, the immune responses elicited by C.
burnetii are associated with inflammatory responses, rheumatoid factor, cryoglobulins or immune-complexes
[8,27]. Antibodies to cardiolipin, nuclear antigens, leukocyte, platelet, mitochondrial and smooth muscle antigens
are commonly found in chronically infected patients
[1,8,27]. The study of IgG subclass distributions has
revealed a significant increase in IgG1 and IgG3 levels in
sera of patients similarly to those described in some
autoimmune diseases [28]. Based on all these findings it
could be proposed that some pathological aspects of the
long-term chronic Q fever disease, such as heart disease,
could be induced or maintained by autoimmune mechanisms. The aim of this study was to characterize the specificity of the autoantigens recognised by circulating
antibodies in sera of patients with acute and chronic Coxiella infections and identify differences between chronic
diseases with and without cardiac involvement. This may
bring new insights to the mechanisms of induction of possible auto-reactive cardiac complications.

Methods
Study Subjects
The work was done in accordance with the regulations of
internal review board of the Institute of Health, Carlos III.
Spain. The patients and volunteers gave a written
informed consent on the use of their sera to participate in
the study, which was approved by the Human Research
Committee.

Serum samples of patients with Q fever. Convalescent sera
from 58 serologically confirmed acute (n = 24) and
chronic (n = 34) Q fever cases were studied. All patients
were adults, equally divided between males and females,
aged 26 – 60 years (mean 45 years). Diagnosis was done
by immunofluorescence using phase I and phase II Coxiella antigens. A serum sample with phase II IgG titre ≥
200 and phase II IgM ≥ 50 was considered acute and a
serum sample with a phase I IgG titre ≥ 800 was classified
as chronic [1,2]. All chronic cases had phase I IgA antibodies titre ≥ 50 [29]. Patients with acute infection had fever
and/or atypical pneumonia but those demonstrating serological evidence of chronic Q fever disease could be
divided in two groups: those with cardiac involvement (n
= 26) or those with other pathologies (hepatic diseases,
fever or bone disease) (n = 8).

Normal control group
Twenty serum samples from healthy volunteers were studied, (males 10, females 10) aged 18 – 36 years (mean 29
years).
Detection of autoantibodies by indirect
immunofluorescence (IIF)
Cryostat sections of monkey cardiac muscle (The Binding
Site, UK) were used as a substrate to determine cardiac
muscle antibodies (CMA). Sections of rat liver, kidney or
stomach (BioSystems, Sp) were used as a substrate to
detect specific antibodies (anti-parietal cell, PCA, and
anti-smooth muscle, ASMA). Human carcinoma cell line
(Hep-2) (MarDx Carlsbad, USA) was used as a substrate to
study anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA). Anti-neutrophil
antibodies (ANCA) were screened using neutrophil slides
(The Binding Site, UK) and anti-double-stranded DNA
antibodies (dsDNA) were assayed using Crithidia luciliae
slides (MarDx Carlsbad, USA).

IIF was done as previously described [30]. Briefly, sera of
patients were diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS)
pH 7.4 (1:40 in ANCA and Hep-2 slides, 1:20 in CMA,
dsDNA and rat liver, kidney and stomach slides) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with each of the
sections. Bound antibodies were detected with a fluorescent rabbit anti-human IgG immunoglobulin (Dako,
DK). After each incubation, the slides were washed three
times for five minutes with PBS. After the final wash, the
slides were mounted in 70% glycerol in PBS and examined in a Leitz Diaplan fluorescence microscope. Slides
were coded and scored blind by two independent examiners.

Detection of HeLa antigens specific autoantibodies by
Western blot
Assay was carried out using methods previously described
[31,32]. Briefly, HeLa cells were cultured at 37°C in 5%
CO2 to logarithmic phase in RPMI 1640 supplemented
with 10 % heat inactivated fetal calf serum, 1 % glutamin,
10 U/ml penicillin and 60 µg/ml streptomycin. Then, the
cells were incubated for 30 min at 4°C in lysis buffer (1 %
Nonidet P-40, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 1
mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 µ/ml aprotinin, 1
µ/ml pepstatin, 1 µ/ml leupeptin and 2 mM EDTA). After
centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatants
were stored at -80°C. Protein concentration was determined by BCA assay (Pierce, Pennsylvania, USA). About
400 µg of HeLa whole cell extracts were separated on 12
% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were electrotransferred to polyvinyl difluoride (PVDF) or nitrocellulose membranes in a
semi-dry system for 1 h at 5.5 mA/cm2 in carbonate
buffer, however ethanol 20 % (v/v) was added instead of
methanol. Membranes were soaked for 1 hour in PBS-5 %
bovine serum albumin (BSA) and incubated overnight
with sera diluted 1:100 in PBS-BSA. After washing, the
membranes were incubated for 1 hour with an alkaline
phosphatase-conjugated anti-human IgG antibody (The
Binding Site. UK) at 1:8000 dilution. After three washes,
antigen-bound antibody was visualised with nitroblue
tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4chloro-3-indolyl phosphate
(Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA) following manufacturer's
instructions.
Protein isolation and N-terminal sequence analysis
HeLa proteins were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to PVDF membranes as described above.
The membranes were then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 and destained in 50 % methanol. The
proteins of interest were cut out from the air-dried membrane and incubated for 30 min with 0.5 % polivinilpirrolidone-40 in 100 mM acetic acid, digested at a enzymesubstrate ratio 1:20 in weight with trypsin in 100 mM
sodium bicarbonate at pH 8.2, and then incubated in acetonitrile 95:5 (v/v) for 16 hours at 37°C. After centrifugation at 12.000 × g for 10 min the digestion mixture was
acidified with 2 % trifluoroacetic acid and the supernatant
injected in a C18 Vydac 2.1 × 250 mm microbore column
(Beckman HPLC "System Gold") at a flow rate of 0.15 ml/
min in a chromatographic gradient of 7% acetonitrile and
0.09 % of trifluoroacetic acid in water. For peptide microsequencing a pulse liquid phase automatic sequencer was
used (Applied Biosystems model 473). Sequence homologies obtained with the other proteins were analysed with
FASTA and TFASTA programs using the update database
from Swissprotein and GenEMBL.

Results obtained with representative sera from each group are depicted. Location of the 50 kD bands are indicated.

Data analysis
The results of IIF were analysed using Fisher's exact test
whenever appropriate. The overall difference was considered significant when p < 0.05.

Results
Detection of autoantibodies by IIF
The substrate specific responses detected in sera of
patients with acute and chronic Q fever infections are
shown in Table 1.

A total of 54.2% of patients with acute infection had
demonstrable responses to at least one of the antigens
tested. One patient had antibodies to dsDNA and three
had ANCA or ANA but only ASMA and CMA were detect-

able in a significant number of patients (29.2 % and
12.1% respectively).
On the other hand, 67.2% of the patients with chronic Q
fever infections showed positive results by IIF, most of
them to various antigens tested and no differences were
found between patients with or without cardiac involvement. Three patients (8.8%) elicited antibodies to dsDNA
or parietal cells, four had ANCA (11.8%) and five ANA
(14.7%), and, as in acute patients, the presence of ASMA
was detected in a significantly higher percentage of sera
(26.5%). CMA were found in 13 patients (38.3%) and
both fibrillar and sarcolemma fluorescence stains were
found (figure 1). The high frequency of CMA-specific antibody response detected on chronically infected patients

was statistically significant (p < 0.05) as compared to
patients with acute infection. Sera samples from healthy
controls showed no reactivity at the dilutions tested.
Detection of antibodies by Western blot and sequence
analysis
Fourteen different HeLa bands, with molecular masses
ranging from 20 to 100 kD, were detected by Western
blot. Normal sera showed minimal if any reactivity with
HeLa proteins. Twelve patients with acute Coxiella infections (57%) showed antibodies that reacted with one to
three different bands per sample. By contrast, twenty-five
sera of patients with chronic Coxiella infections (75%)
showed antibody reactivities to a broad spectrum of up to
seven different proteins. A predominant and consistent 50
kD band was observed in 14 of the patients with chronic

infections (42%) and in 3 of the acute cases (14%) (Figure
2). No reactivity to this band was found in healthy controls. Sequence analysis of a fragment of this 50 kD protein showed a 98% homology with human elongation
factor 1 alpha (Figure 3).

Discussion
It must be noted that the presence of natural autoantibodies is a normal feature in sera of healthy individuals and
their presence may only be circumstantial or transitory.
Such natural autoantibodies are usually present at low
titre, have poor affinity for their corresponding antigen
and usually belong to the IgM class. In autoimmune diseases, self-antigens are recognised by pathological autoantibodies with specificities that differ from those that may
occur naturally in healthy humans [26].

As in other infectious diseases, some immunological
aspects of the host response to Coxiella in patients with Q
fever could be related to self-antigen responses. In our
hands, the presence of PCA, ANA, dsDNA and ANCA does
not seem to clearly correlate with any of our group of
patients and could be only circumstantial. Only ASMA
and CMA antibodies were found in a significant percentage of acute and chronically infected Q fever patients as
compared to the normal population. In the literature,
CMA have rarely been found in normal individuals and
their presence has been associated with autoimmune
myocarditis, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy or rheumatic carditis [33-37]. Many different specificities have
been described but mitochondrial and contractile cytoplasmic proteins such as myosin or actin seem to be
widely implicated [33,38]. CMA detection following
microbial infections has been related to the release of antigens after tissue damage, but in some cases, as in chlamydia infections, Chagas disease, post-streptoccocal
rheumatic fever or coxsackie myopericarditis, molecular
homologies between host antigens and the etiological
agent have been described [11,18,21,25]. CMA presence
in the sera of Q fever patients without cardiac involvement was unexpected and suggested that they were not
elicited by tissue damage. The possible existence of molecular homologies between coxiella and host antigens was
studied by immunoblotting with human HeLa extracts.
Results revealed that sera from most of the chronically
infected patients and some of acute patients reacted
strongly with a 50 kD antigen. Preliminary results of the
sequence analysis of an internal fragment of this protein
showed molecular homology with human elongation factor 1 alpha. This ubiquitously expressed protein is phylogenetically conserved and an abundant member of the
actin binding proteins family, responsible for binding the
aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosome during polypeptide
elongation [39-41]. It co-localises intracellularly with the
F-actin and is related to changes in the actin cytoskeleton.
High levels of its expression are correlated with cell proliferation, oncogenic transformation, metastasis and are
been considered a molecular market for injured muscle
[42,43] and it has been described as a common IgG autoantibody target in atopic dermatitis and Felty's syndrome
[44,45].
This preliminary study shows that, as in other infectious
diseases, patients with Coxiella infections have an autoantibody profile with specificities that resemble those found
in autoimmune disease. Further studies would be needed
to evaluate whether these findings could only be considered a circumstantial evidence of natural response or have
pathological implications.
