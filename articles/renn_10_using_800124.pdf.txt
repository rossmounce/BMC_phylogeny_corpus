Abstract
Background: Genome-wide analysis of sequence divergence among species offers profound insights into the
evolutionary processes that shape lineages. When full-genome sequencing is not feasible for a broad comparative
study, we propose the use of array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) in order to identify orthologous
genes with high sequence divergence. Here we discuss experimental design, statistical power, success rate, sources of
variation and potential confounding factors. We used a spotted PCR product microarray platform from Drosophila
melanogaster to assess sequence divergence on a gene-by-gene basis in three fully sequenced heterologous species
(D. sechellia, D. simulans, and D. yakuba). Because complete genome assemblies are available for these species this study
presents a powerful test for the use of aCGH as a tool to measure sequence divergence.
Results: We found a consistent and linear relationship between hybridization ratio and sequence divergence of the
sample to the platform species. At higher levels of sequence divergence (< 92% sequence identity to D. melanogaster)
~84% of features had significantly less hybridization to the array in the heterologous species than the platform species,
and thus could be identified as "diverged". At lower levels of divergence (≥ 97% identity), only 13% of genes were
identified as diverged. While ~40% of the variation in hybridization ratio can be accounted for by variation in sequence
identity of the heterologous sample relative to D. melanogaster, other individual characteristics of the DNA sequences,
such as GC content, also contribute to variation in hybridization ratio, as does technical variation.
Conclusions: Here we demonstrate that aCGH can accurately be used as a proxy to estimate genome-wide
divergence, thus providing an efficient way to evaluate how evolutionary processes and genomic architecture can
shape species diversity in non-model systems. Given the increased number of species for which microarray platforms
are available, comparative studies can be conducted for many interesting lineages in order to identify highly diverged
genes that may be the target of natural selection.
Background
Comparison of genomic DNA sequence among closely
related strains or species is a powerful approach with
which to identify heterogeneity in evolutionary processes
such as selection, mutation rates, and rates of introgression, as well as to unmask phylogenetic relationships.
However, even with the recent advances in DNA
sequencing technology and rapidly dropping costs, complete genome sequence data are not readily available for
many closely related eukaryotes that serve as model sys* Correspondence: renns@reed.edu

tems for organismal evolution [but see [1,2]]. As an alternative, comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) offers
a means to estimate sequence divergence.
Although the use of genomic DNA (gDNA) hybridization for phylogenetic analyses and genome-wide estimation of sequence similarity date to long before vast
amounts of sequence data became available [e.g. [3,4]],
this approach has experienced a renaissance with the
development of genomic tools, specifically microarrays.
On a relatively coarse level, array-based CGH (aCGH)
has been widely applied to identify chromosomal aberrations underlying cancer [for review see [5]]. When gDNA
isolated from a tumor is competitively hybridized against
gDNA isolated from normal tissue, genomic regions that

have been deleted in the genome of the tumor cells will
fail to hybridize to the array features while genomic
regions that have been duplicated (amplified) in the
genome of the tumor cells will hybridize at a ratio of 2:1
(or greater). At a finer level of resolution, modifications of
this technique have allowed microarray-based genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms within and
between populations [e.g. Arabidopsis: [6], stickleback
fish: [7]]. Array-based techniques can also be applied to
genome-scale comparisons between closely related species (or strains) in order to conduct a (nearly) complete
analysis of sequence divergence on a gene-by-gene basis.
Unlike microarrays designed for genotyping known
polymorphisms [reviewed by [8]] or re-sequencing
[human: [9], Arabidopsis: [10]], microarrays designed for
gene expression studies can also be used to compare the
genomic content (in coding sequence) of closely related
species. In a typical experiment, gDNA from the platform
species (from which the microarray was constructed) is
compared on the array to gDNA from another (heterologous) species of interest. This technique has been used to
reveal genomic regions likely involved in an organism's
ability to inhabit a specific environment [Chlamydia trachomatis tissue specificity: [11], Sinorhizobium meliloti
root symbiont: [12], Clostridium difficile host specificity:
[13]], pathogenicity [Yersinia pesits: [14,15], Mycobacterium tuberculosis: [16], Vibrio cholerae: [17]], genomic
duplications and deletions associated with population
divergence and speciation [Anopheles gambiae: [18,19]],
and genomic regions that differentiate humans from
other primate species [20,21]. While most studies rely
only on presence or absence metrics, a few studies have
suggested that the relationship between hybridization
signal ratio using aCGH and nucleotide identity is
roughly log-linear [11,22]. Using this relatively inexpensive approach, it is possible to identify rapidly evolving
genes [Paxillus involutus: [23]] and in some cases lend
insight to phylogenetic relationships [Shewanella: [24],
Salmonella: [25], Saccharomyces: [26]]. While the majority of these examples derive from studies in microbes, the
technique is amenable to genomes of any size. It must be
noted, of course, that array-based comparisons do not
reveal the actual genomic sequence for the novel genes of
interest. Instead, an estimate of sequence identity is
obtained at a price and effort far below that of whole
genome sequencing.
In the present study, we examine the relationship
between hybridization ratio and sequence divergence
using a cDNA microarray constructed for D. melanogaster. The availability of complete genome assemblies
[27] for Drosophila melanogaster as well as three other
Drosophilid species, D. simulans, D. sechellia (both 2-3
MY diverged relative to D. melanogaster) and D. yakuba

Page 2 of 12

(10-15 MY diverged relative to D. melanogaster)[28] provides us with a unique opportunity to demonstrate the
degree to which hybridization ratio reflects underlying
sequence divergence. It is not our goal to devise an
explicit model to explain variation in hybridization due to
other sequence characteristics; rather, we demonstrate
success rate, discuss the effects of a few characteristics
contributing to variation in hybridization kinetics, and
provide an example for the use of aCGH that can be
applied to non-model organisms.
We show that sequence divergence between orthologous genes can be successfully detected for closely and
not so closely related species. Approximately 40% of the
variation in gDNA hybridization ratios can be explained
by sequence divergence, as measured by nucleotide dissimilarity between sequences. Other sequence-specific
characteristics also explain part of the variation in
hybridization ratio, and become more prominent with
increased sequence divergence. Similarly, technical variation increases with increasing sequence divergence; however, this last source of variation can be overcome with
increased replication. We demonstrate the potential for
functional analysis and the generation of testable hypotheses based upon hybridization statistics for Gene Ontology annotation.

Results and Discussion
Detection of reduced hybridization

In order to identify array features for which hybridization
strength was reduced in each of three heterologous Drosophilid species, two direct comparisons to D. melanogaster were performed. After filtering for unusable array
features (low quality or intensity), approximately 80% of
the array features were available for analysis in each species. From these data we identified array features for
which the genomic DNA hybridization signal for each
species was reduced compared with D. melanogaster. As
predicted by their divergence time relative to D. melanogaster, the fraction of array features that showed a statistically significant reduction in genomic hybridization
signal relative to D. melanogaster was similar for D.
sechellia (45.4%) and D. simulans (55.8%), and was considerably greater for the more distant D. yakuba (70.6%)
(P < 0.1 FDR corrected) (Table 1). This result, a first for
this degree of divergence among multicellular organisms
with complex genomes, is consistent with that obtained
by Edwards-Ingram et al. [26]. These authors showed that
the "molecular taxonomy" of yeast (Saccharomyces sensu
stricto) as determined by aCGH using a binary presenceabsence and parsimony-based method closely matched
the phylogeny inferred from the complete genome
sequences [29]. Similarly, the neighbor-joining and parsimony-based trees constructed with aCGH data from dif-

phylogenetic hypotheses inferred from genomic
sequence [30].
Detection of sequence divergence

In order to test the ability to detect highly diverged
sequences with aCGH, we used BLAST to query the full
genome assemblies of each of the heterologous species
with the predicted D. melanogaster probe sequences to
provide a measure of sequence divergence for comparison to the array-based measures. The percent nucleotide
similarity of the top BLAST hit for the heterologous species to the probe sequence is termed the "percent identity" (%ID). Therefore, a lower %ID represents greater
sequence divergence between the heterologous species
and D. melanogaster for that particular array feature. We
asked to what extent statistical analysis of aCGH results
recovered the actual sequence divergence between the
species examined. The majority of the array features for
which hybridization was significantly reduced (P < 0.1
FDR corrected) in the heterologous species relative to D.
melanogaster are truly diverged in the heterologous species examined (Figure 1). As can be seen in Figure 1, the
proportion of features identified as diverged by aCGH

increased dramatically from 97 %ID to 92 %ID, with the
relationship between %ID and proportion identified as
diverged plateauing at either extreme. On average, 84% of
the orthologs that share less than 92 %ID to D. melanogaster showed significantly reduced hybridization. For
orthologs between 92 - 97 %ID, approximately 50% had
significantly reduced hybridization, and at 97 %ID and
greater an average of only 13% of features had significantly reduced hybridization. Fitting a logistic curve to
these data, we estimated the limit of detectable sequence
divergence as the %ID for which there is a 50% chance of
a feature being called diverged by aCGH analysis (ID-50)
[similar to power analysis techniques, e.g. [31]]. The ID50 was similar for all three heterologous species (D.
sechellia: 95.5 %ID; D. simulans: 94.7 %ID; D. yakuba: 94
%ID). It should be noted that, in general, these levels will
vary depending on array quality and replication.
Relationship between sequence divergence and
hybridization ratio

The majority of aCGH studies, even in microbes, aim to
identify only presence or absence of orthologs. Such studies generally employ one of two assignment strategies.
The first strategy employs a cut-off threshold derived

from a separate characterized strain or other published
results [32,33]. The second strategy analyzes each hybridization dataset according to its intrinsic experimental
variability [e.g. GACK: [34], GENCOM: [35]] in order to
determine presence or absence. However, beyond a
binary assignment, a more descriptive relationship
between sequence divergence and hybridization ratio is
possible. For example, Kim et al. [34] defined a transition
zone for those genes thought to be present but highly
diverged. For two genes, studied in seven microbial species, a linear relationship was found between the log
hybridization ratio and percent divergence [24]. Similar
studies conducted with species of the genus Bartonella
[36] or strains of Chlamydia [11] also found a linear relationship between log hybridization ratio and percent
sequence divergence and noted deviation from the linearity of the relationship for orthologs with < 75 %ID, of
which there were few in our study.
In order to quantify the extent to which hybridization
ratio depicts the true underlying sequence divergence, we
measure the correlation between these two measures. For
all three species comparisons, a linear regression of %ID
and log2 hybridization ratio showed a strong and highly
significant correlation (D. sechellia: Multiple R2 = 0.3257,
P < 2.2e-16; D. simulans: Multiple R2 = 0.2920, P < 2.2e16; D. yakuba: Multiple R2 = 0.4083, P < 2.2e-16) (Figure
2), with the data for D. yakuba showing the strongest correlation. The apparent decrease in correlations (lower R2)
seen for D. sechellia and D. simulans compared to that for
D. yakuba reflects the increased range of feature
sequence divergence of D. yakuba orthologs, in addition
to the contribution of technical variation rather than
actual sequence variation for the less diverged D. sechellia
and D. simulans orthologs.

Sources of variation and statistical power

While technical variation in hybridization ratios exists
even for within-species experiments (where sample and
probe sequences are almost identical), previous work has
suggested that this variation increases as sequence identity decreases [e.g. [22,37]]; however, this relationship has
not been fully investigated. Here, with the incorporation
of additional replicates and the consideration of variation
due to hybridization kinetics, we expand our understanding of the sources of variation that cause the hybridization ratio for individual features to deviate from the value
predicted by the linear regression.
To test whether increased technical replication reduces
technical variation, we focused on D. yakuba, which
offers the greatest range of sequence divergence relative
to D. melanogaster. We included six additional D. yakuba
vs. D. melanogaster hybridization experiments (for a total
of eight arrays) and repeated the analysis with all possible
two, four, and six array combinations as well as using the
full complement of eight heterologous aCGH experiments. As expected, for a given statistical threshold,
increased technical replication resulted in an increase in
the fraction of features that were detected as diverged and
an increase in ID-50, our measure for the limit of detectable sequence divergence (see above) (Table 2). Interestingly, the R2 value for the regression model of
hybridization ratio on %ID was not substantially affected
by the increased replication, yet the accuracy of sequence
identity estimates for individual array features improved,
as demonstrated by the decreased standard error of the
fitted value (Figure 3). This effect was stronger for array
features of 70 - 80 %ID than for features of 90 - 95 %ID.
This observation has important implications for experimental design. While orthologs of greater sequence
divergence are easily identified, even with few technical

replicates, an accurate estimate of their sequence identity
requires additional hybridizations. With eight technical
replicates, an additional 5% of the variation in hybridization ratio can be attributed to %ID. The remainder of the
variation (i.e. deviation from the regression line) is likely
due to the individual characteristics of the sequence differences between the heterologous species and the platform species.
Variation in DNA hybridization kinetics has been
shown to increase with sequence divergence [22]. Such
variation can be caused by any of several physical characteristics of - or differences between - sample DNA and
probe DNA (including presence/absence of introns, GC
content, distribution of sequence variation, length of
probe, and length of sequence alignment). While minor

differences between technical replicates account for the
proportion of the total variation that is due to technical
error, the proportion of the total variation that is due to
DNA hybridization kinetics manifests as a deviation from
the regression line (Figure 4A). When DNA sequence
characteristics produce increased hybridization strength,
the hybridization ratio for the array feature in question is
expected to be greater than the value predicted by the
regression model for %ID. Conversely, when DNA
sequence characteristics produce decreased hybridization strength, there is an expected decrease in hybridization ratio for that array feature. Even though it was not
our goal here to devise an absolute metric that accounts
for all possible sources of variation, we explored the relative contribution of technical variation and variation due
to hybridization kinetics.
The magnitude of the variation due to technical error is
measured by the SD of the fitted value for the hybridization ratio of each feature. The magnitude of the variation
due to DNA hybridization kinetics is measured by the
standard deviation (SD) of the residuals from the regression line (estimated as the median absolute residual
divided by 0.6745). Based on the 8-array D. yakuba vs. D.
melanogaster dataset, we found that hybridization ratios
for features representing conserved orthologs (greater
than ~95 %ID) were more affected by technical error,
whereas those of more diverged orthologs (less than ~95
%ID) were more strongly influenced by DNA hybridization kinetics (Figure 4B). Both technical error and variation due to DNA hybridization kinetics increase with
greater sequence divergence.
To demonstrate how physical characteristics other than
%ID can contribute to DNA hybridization kinetics, we
considered GC content of the D. melanogaster probe (GC
content), the length of the D. melanogaster probe (probe
length), and the percent of the D. melanogaster probe
length over which the heterologous sequence can be
aligned (percent alignment length). We incorporated
these variables into the linear regression model of hybridization ratios vs. %ID to D. melanogaster (hybridization

yakuba and D. melanogaster dataset. Both GC content
and percent alignment length were significant in the
model, and there was a significant interaction effect of
GC content and %ID (Table 3). To assess the relative
effect size for these explanatory variables, the response
and explanatory variables were standardized such that
the mean of each variable was 0 with a standard deviation
of 1. The effect size for GC content decreased with

increasing %ID, yet it retained a positive effect on hybridization ratio (Figure 5). There was also a positive effect of
percent alignment length on hybridization ratio, although
unaffected by %ID. At lower levels of divergence (greater
than 85 %ID), percent alignment length had a greater relative effect size than GC content (Figure 5). Since high
GC content is likely to produce a more stable bond
between two DNA strands, it is not surprising that a
higher GC content of the array probe would produce a

sequence analysis (in multiple individuals) would be necessary to further investigate any genes of interest identified by this method (e.g., synonymous vs. nonsynonymous substitutions).
Example analysis 1: constraint within Gene Ontology
categories

Figure 5 Standardized effect sizes of probe characteristics across
%ID of D. yakuba to D. melanogaster. P-values for the partial correlations of GC content, probe length, and relative alignment length of
probe sequence to D. yakuba sequence are from the (non-standardized) regression model (Table 3). GC content and percent alignment
are always positively correlated with hybridization ratio, and GC content has a significant interaction with %ID (the effect sizes decrease
with increasing %ID).

stronger bond with a diverged sequence than would be
seen at low GC content, with conserved GC regions contributing extra stability to the otherwise weak bond. It is
interesting that this effect is even more pronounced at
higher levels of divergence, supporting the hypothesis of
stabilization of weak bonds.
It is also intuitive that percent alignment length would
be positively correlated with the D. yakuba vs. D. melanogaster hybridization ratio, as it is another measure of
divergence that is not taken into consideration by %ID. A
complete alignment indicates low divergence, whereas an
incomplete alignment indicates substantial divergence.
The absence of a strong correlation between relative
alignment length and hybridization ratio may be due to
insertions in the heterologous sequence that result in
reduced hybridization strength and inflated relative
alignment length (even above 100%). Our goal in discussing these variables is to demonstrate the complexity of
hybridization kinetics without devising a precise metric.
For that reason we did not include other possible explanatory variables, such as insertions, deletions, GC content
of the heterologous sample, or even the presence of paralogs, in our discussion. These factors undoubtedly will
contribute to studies in non-model species; however,
without full genome sequence, little benefit would be
gained from an explicit model. We see aCGH as an efficient and inexpensive method for identifying highly
diverged genes among species for which little or no
genomic sequence information is available. Direct

Data from aCGH can be used to uncover trends among
functional gene categories. Categories that are found to
be either more diverged or conserved can provide
hypotheses about which functions and pathways are
under stabilizing or directional selection. Using the Gene
Ontology (GO) framework, we can statistically test for
over- or under-representation of specific biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components
(Figure 6). Deviations from the null hypothesis (i.e. equal
representation) might suggest directional selection or
evolutionary constraint.
We tested for under-representation of GO categories
among the genes determined by aCGH to be diverged in
D. yakuba (D. melanogaster-biased). Of the 7009 D. melanogaster-biased features with FlyBase gene IDs (representing 6094 genes), approximately half had GO
annotations. Several GO categories were found to be
under-represented, indicating increased sequence conservation and possible constraint of these processes,
functions, and components in the D. yakuba lineage (see
Additional file 1; representatives with asterisk on Figure
6). Molecular functions that were found to be under-represented in the set of diverged genes include GTPase and
ATPase activities, NADH dehydrogenase activity, hydrogen ion transport activity, and acid-amino acid ligase
activity as well as general ligase activity. Underrepresented biological processes include translation, ATP synthesis-coupled
electron
transport,
oxidative
phosphorylation, protein transport, actin-filament-based
processes, cell-cell signaling, including synaptic transmission, and several processes associated with development
(instar larval or pupal development, organ development
and organ morphogenesis, eye development, and sensory
organ development more generally). Finally, underrepresented cellular components include those associated with
the proton-transporting ATPase, cytosol, ribosome, lipid
particle, clathrin-coated vesicle, cytoplasmic vesicle, and
the synapse. Overall, 111 out of 4874 GO categories that
were tested (2.3%) were under-represented (i.e. more
conserved) than would have been expected by chance (P
< 0.01). As demonstrated in this example analysis, categories involved in very fundamental processes (ie. protein
synthesis and transport, basic metabolic activity, development, and synaptic function) are likely to be more constrained.
In this example, we used GO annotations specifically
for Drosophila genes. However, this strategy can also be

based on DNA sequence similarity between array features and annotations (which are primarily derived from
standard model organisms). Despite the ascertainment
bias inherent to GO terms, which is largely due to the
nature of hypothesis-driven research conducted in model
organisms, this approach allows rigorous statistical analysis for over- and under-representation of particular
molecular functions, biological processes, and cellular
components [for example, see [38]]. Also, applying GO
terms reduces the complexity of the data, avoids experimenter bias in cross-referencing between experiments
and species, and facilitates comparisons of experimental
results obtained in different organisms and/or with different platforms.
Example analysis 2: highly diverged genes

Genes that have high divergence among species can be
identified as those with substantially reduced hybridization ratios. We focus on array features with greater than
four-fold reduction in hybridization ratio for D. yakuba.
Among these 1686 highly D. melanogaster biased features, representing 145 genes with GO annotations, six

GO categories were found to be overrepresented, including peptidase activity, serine hydrolase activity, sensory
perception of taste, and three parent GO terms (P < 0.01).
The enrichment for D. melanogaster-biased features suggests that genes in these categories are either highly
diverged or are deleted in D. yakuba.
Among these 145 highly diverged genes with GO annotations, there were 47 that showed a four-fold reduction
in hybridization strength relative to D. melanogaster in all
three study species. This set of putatively highly diverged
genes includes those with annotations to 94 different GO
terms, including cell adhesion, zinc ion binding, and protein serine/threonine kinase activity (Table 4). Analysis of
%ID of the array feature sequence and the top BLAST hit
to the heterologous genome confirms that most of these
features have a high level of sequence divergence from D.
melanogaster in all three species or have no significant
BLAST hit to the heterologous genome (e-value < 10-14),
suggesting high sequence divergence or deletion. These
data can also be analyzed according to other annotation
schemes, and signatures of selection can be addressed
with the cloning and sequencing of candidate genes in
non-model organisms.

Conclusions
The results presented here demonstrate that aCGH can
robustly detect genes that are highly diverged in a given
species compared with one for which a microarray platform is available. Our use of a D. melanogaster microarray to estimate sequence divergence on a gene-by-gene
basis for three fully sequenced heterologous species
allowed for a proof-of-principle for this approach and
allowed us to explore the success and biases inherent in
this technique. We found a consistent and linear relationship between array hybridization ratio and sequence
divergence between the sample and the platform species.
The limit of detectable sequence divergence depends on
the power of the experiment. While the power can be
increased with additional technical replicates, there will
still be a subset of diverged genes that escape detection
due to other specific hybridization kinetics of the sample
DNA to the array feature. This technique is generally
applicable, even though thresholds, correlation strengths,
and appropriate divergence distances may differ for different array platforms (cDNAs, long or short oligonucleotides). As the number of microarray platforms available
for non-traditional model species is continually increasing [axolotl: [39], dolphin: [40], butterfly: [41,42], coral:
[43], many fish species, for review: [44], crustaceans: [4547]], researchers focusing on these and related model systems will continue to benefit from the relatively low cost
of array hybridizations. Rapid advances in next-generation sequencing technology notwithstanding [2,48],
aCGH provides an effective alternative to de novo
sequencing of a large number of complex eukaryotic
genomes.
Methods
Array Production

We used a Drosophila melanogaster microarray with
~22,000 features containing PCR products (~500 base
pairs long) generated from custom primers designed to
predict open reading frames [[33]; GEO platform number
GPL6056]. The microarray was printed on poly-L-lysine
slides (Thermo Scientific) in a 48 pin format using an
OmniGrid-100 arrayer (GeneMachines). Following
hydration, snap drying and UV cross-linking, the slides
were blocked with succinic anhydride and sodium borate
in 1-Methyl-2-Pyrrolidinone, rinsed, dried according to
standard procedure [49] and stored dry until used.
Sample Preparation and aCGH

Isogenic Drosophila melanogaster, D. simulans, D.
sechellia and D. yakuba strains (Dmel\y;cn;bw;sp,
Dsim\w [501], Dsec\Robertson3C, Dyak Tai18E2) were
obtained from the Tuscon Drosophila stock center (now
known as the San Diego Drosophila Species Stock Center). Genomic DNA was isolated from ~100 Drosophila

Page 10 of 12

males of each stock according to a standard ProteinaseK/
Phenol:Chloroform protocol. DNA quantity and purity
was assayed (via Nanodrop 1000) prior to and after DNA
size reduction using a Hydroshear (Genome Solutions/
Digilab) with a standard orifice set to maximal possible
shearing speed (13) for 20 cycles (maximal shearing
speed varies with individual orifice). This treatment
resulted in fragments of 500 bp - 2 kb as determined by
gel electrophoresis, visualized with ethidium bromide.
Two micrograms of sheared genomic DNA was fluorescently labeled through incorporation of Cy3 or Cy5
labeled dCTP (Amersham) in a Klenow fragment (Invitrogen; Bioprime) reaction of 35 microliters according to
manufacturer's protocol. Labeled sample DNA was purified by size exclusion on YM-30 filters (Eppendorf ) and
appropriate samples were combined. Hybridizations proceeded for ~16 hours at 65°C in a 3.4× SSC, 0.15% SDS, 1
mM DTT hybridization buffer. Male D. melanogaster
samples were used in competitive hybridizations with
two male D. sechellia samples, two male D. simulans samples and two male D. yakuba samples, incorporating dye
swaps to account for dye bias. These aCGH hybridizations were analyzed for the ability to detect significantly
diverged genes. An additional six D. melanogaster versus
D. yakuba aCGH hybridizations were available in order to
asses the effect of increased technical replication. For this
power analysis, only genes located on the autosomes were
used because a subset of the hybridizations involved D.
yakuba female genomic DNA of the same strain.
Microarray Data Analysis

Hybridized arrays were scanned with an Axon 4000B
scanner (Axon Instruments) using Genepix 5.0 software
(Axon Instruments). All raw array data have been submitted to GEO database (dataseries number GSE18416 sample number GSM459056-67). Features of poor quality
(signal intensity < 2 standard deviations above background) and those of potentially erroneous sequences
(mismatch between initial PCR product sequence prediction and current D. melanogaster database; refseq_rna
12/2008) were excluded. Features were only considered in
the analysis if they survived these technical filters on multiple arrays for a given species comparison. Raw data
from Genepix was imported into R, and LIMMA [50] was
used to apply a background correction ("minimum") and
within-array intensity normalization ("loess"). Because we
expect the normalization of cross-species arrays to be
affected by a substantial number of diverged genes in the
non-platform species [51], we performed the withinarray normalization using a set of ~1000 genes highly
conserved (greater than ~95% sequence identity; determined with NCBI BLAST to Genbank) among D. melanogaster D. simulans and D. yakuba. A linear model was
fitted to the data using "lmFit", and "eBayes" provided

error shrinkage towards a pooled estimate of variation
[52]. Array features were tested for hybridization ratios
that were significantly different from equal as assessed
after a FDR multiple testing correction at P < 0.1 [53].
The Gene Ontology analysis was conducted in GOstats
[54], using features with FlyBase IDs, as listed in the GEO
platform.

Genomic Sequence Divergence

The sequences of the D. melanogaster probes were predicted by blasting primers from the D. melanogaster
probe (GEO Profiles accession: GPL6056) against the D.
melanogaster Release 5 assembly and searching for
unique and proximal (within 600 base pairs of each other)
targets. We queried the resulting sequences against the D.
simulans and D. yakuba NCBI genomes (chromosome)
using "megablast" (2009) and against the full chromosome sequence assemblies for D. sechellia downloaded
from flybase.org (release 1.3). From each heterologous
genome, the top BLAST hit to each array feature (threshold e-value 10-14) was used to obtain the percent similarity between the two sequences and the length of the
alignment.
