Pseudogenes as an alternative source of natural
antisense transcripts
Enrique M Muro*, Miguel A Andrade-Navarro

Abstract
Background: Naturally occurring antisense transcripts (NATs) are non-coding RNAs that may regulate the activity
of sense transcripts to which they bind because of complementarity. NATs that are not located in the gene they
regulate (trans-NATs) have better chances to evolve than cis-NATs, which is evident when the sense strand of the
cis-NAT is part of a protein coding gene. However, the generation of a trans-NAT requires the formation of a
relatively large region of complementarity to the gene it regulates.
Results: Pseudogene formation may be one evolutionary mechanism that generates trans-NATs to the parental
gene. For example, this could occur if the parental gene is regulated by a cis-NAT that is copied as a trans-NAT in
the pseudogene. To support this we identified human pseudogenes with a trans-NAT to the parental gene in their
antisense strand by analysis of the database of expressed sequence tags (ESTs). We found that the mutations that
appeared in these trans-NATs after the pseudogene formation do not show the flat distribution that would be
expected in a non functional transcript. Instead, we found higher similarity to the parental gene in a region nearby
the 3’ end of the trans-NATs.
Conclusions: Our results do not imply a functional relation of the trans-NAT arising from pseudogenes over their
respective parental genes but add evidence for it and stress the importance of duplication mechanisms of genetic
material in the generation of non-coding RNAs. We also provide a plausible explanation for the large transcripts
that can be found in the antisense strand of some pseudogenes.

Background
Non-coding RNA transcripts have emerged as an important type of regulatory molecules [1,2], in particular,
Natural Antisense Transcripts (NATs) that can bind by
partial complementarity to sense RNA transcripts to
modulate their processing [3,4]. Their generation and
mechanism of action are different to those of miRNAs,
which are processed into shorter 21 nt products and
have possibly less specific effects [5].
Complementarity to target transcript, which is a
requirement for a NAT to have an effect, is evident if
the NAT is expressed in cis to the sense transcript (that
is, the NAT is located in the antisense strand of its target sense transcript), but this ties the evolution of both
the sense transcript target and its cis-NAT [6].
Trans-NATs, on the other hand, are transcribed from
a sequence that it is not located in the same genomic

locus of their target and can then evolve separately constrained only by keeping a complementary region to the
target gene [7]. Against accumulating evidence about
trans-NATs, the puzzle remains of how relatively large
and specific complementary regions can arise to form
such anti-sense transcripts. A possibility that we raise
here is that given a parental gene regulated by a cisNAT, the duplication of the genomic fragment including
the cis-NAT may result in a pseudogene holding an
active copy of the cis-NAT, which is naturally a transNAT of the parental gene. Then, evolution can eliminate any of the NATs or tune their expression differently. More generally, the formation of any pseudogene
results in complementary regions to the parental gene
which, if combined with elements of transcriptional control antisense to the pseudogene, can conceivably lead to
the generation of a trans-NAT antisense the pseudogene
that is a potential regulator of the parental gene.
Antisense transcription from pseudogenes in mammals was discovered in human [8] and mouse [9], but

strongest Poly-Adenylation Signals (PAS: “AAUAAA”
and “AUUAAA”) found within 30 nt of their 3’-end
[17], splicing signals and cDNA-end poly-A tracts.
We then aligned the trans-NAT to its homologous
region in the antisense strand of the parental gene (see
Figure 1). The goal is to study the position of the mutations that appeared in the trans-NAT region after the
pseudogene formation. In most cases (77 cases out of
87, see Methods) the alignment on the parental gene
included the region that surrounds the PAS of the
trans-NAT. In 15 cases we found ESTs in the parental
gene region that suggested the expression of a cis-NAT
equivalent to the observed trans-NAT.
To study the patterns of evolution of the 77 transNATs that fully aligned to the parental gene, we generated a histogram that describes the sequence identity
between the pseudogene region originating the transNAT and the parental gene (Figure 2). Neutral evolution
would be indicated by a flat distribution of identity,
whereas variations from this distribution should show
selection pressure for some sequence features that
would point to functionality [18]. Most of the contribution to this observation is due to a lower occurrence of
indels (Additional file 1: figure S1).
The plot shows a region of higher identity extending
about 50 nt upstream the PAS of the trans-NATs
expressed antisense to pseudogenes. This implies that a
lower than expected level of mutations appeared in a
region nearby the 3’ end of the trans-NATs after the
pseudogene formation Such selection pressure to preserve a region of complementarity to the parental gene
suggests that these transcripts may be functioning as
regulators of the parental gene. These results are not
too sensitive to the quality of the alignment between
EST and pseudogene (See Additional file 2: Figure S2).
In the next paragraphs we show some examples of the
trans-NATs expressed in antisense to pseudogenes
found in this study in more detail. Details about these
examples and about the complete set are in Additional
file 3 and 4: Tables S1 and S2.

with unknown function. Although it has been estimated
that up to 20% of human pseudogenes can originate
transcripts [10] there is little evidence of such transcripts having an effect in the expression of the parental
genes or any other functionality for that matter [11].
Possibly, the best characterized example is the neuronal
nitric oxide synthase gene (nNOS) in the central nervous system of the snail Lymnaea stagnalis. In this case,
the nNOS pseudogene is itself a trans-NAT that inhibits
the expression of nNOS [12], and this trans-NAT is
expressed in a conditioning-dependent manner indicating a role in learning and long-term memory [13].
Other less-direct evidence of transcription from pseudogenes with an effect on the expression of their parental
genes was given by the finding of pseudogenes that are
the source of dsRNAs regulating gene expression in
mouse oocytes [14,15]. Expression of possible siRNAs
from pseudogenes has also been studied in rice [16].
An explanation for this small number of cases could
be that the evolution of a functional trans-NAT from
the antisense strand of a pseudogene eventually erases
the traces of the pseudogene; therefore, the possibility of
observing a trans-NAT related to a pseudogene could
be transitory in evolutionary terms. For this reason, an
exhaustive study of the database of transcripts to find
and analyze the expression and sequence of antisense
transcripts from pseudogenes is necessary to show evidence of these mechanisms.
We identified pseudogenes with transcription from their
antisense strand; by definition, these are complementary
to the parental gene of the pseudogene and can be defined
as trans-NATs of that parental gene. Then, we studied the
alignment between the DNA sequence the trans-NAT is
transcribed from and the parental gene. In particular, we
obtained the distribution of the mutations that appeared
in the trans-NAT after the pseudogene formation. We
observed distinctly a higher similarity between the
sequences in a 50 nt region nearby the 3’ end of the antisense transcript. This shows an increased selection pressure to keep the similarity between the pseudogene and
the parental gene in the region that corresponds to the
end of the trans-NAT and suggests a functional association between the trans-NATs and the parental gene.

parental gene without cis-NAT evidence

Results
We found 87 transcripts expressed antisense of human
pseudogenes by analysis of the expressed sequence tag
(EST) database (see Methods section). These transcripts
are complementary to the parental gene and are by definition trans-NATs. The ESTs used as evidence were
selected to align significantly better to the pseudogene
than to any other genomic location. The direction of
their transcription was verified using as evidence the

AI803540 (446 nt, from a library pooled from human
melanocyte, fetal heart, and pregnant uterus) aligns antisense to a pseudogene (chromosome 3, 75,547,155 75,547,600; UCSC hg18 genome version equivalent to
NCBI Build 36.1) and has a PAS “AATAAA” at position
75,547,171 (Figure 3). The region of the pseudogene originating this trans-NAT aligns to the 6th intron of the
parental gene (ALG1) in chromosome 16 (5,068,153 5,068,597). The identity between the pseudogene and
the parental gene regions is 95% all over the 446 nt of

the EST, but the parental gene lacks the equivalent PAS
due to two mutations ("AGTGAA”).
In agreement to this, there is no cDNA evidence of
the expression of a cis-NAT in the corresponding region
of ALG1. We propose that EST AI803540 represents a
trans-NAT that could interact with the pre-mRNA of
ALG1. Another 5 ESTs support AI803540. ALG1
encodes a protein glycosyl transferase that was associated to a severe congenital disorder of glycosylation
producing death in early infancy [19].

is taken downstream the 5’-end of the EST -100 nt; no region of
high conservation is present. Values are averaged in a window of

statistically significant (p-value = 4.482 × 10^-7 from a KolmogorovSmirnov test).

AA897638 (400 nt, from a library pooled from fetal
lung, testis, and B-cells) aligns antisense to a pseudogene (chromosome 9, 87,585,882 - 87,586,276) and has
a PAS at position 87,585,900. The corresponding pseudogene region is 98.5% identical to a region less than 70
Kb away (85,646,797 - 85,647,191) that includes an exon
from gene KIF27 (encoding kinesin family member 27)
and flanking regions. Additional EST evidence supports
the expression of both the trans-NAT from the pseudogene and of a cis-NAT from the parental gene using the
equivalent antisense PAS (with 2 and 4 ESTs, respectively). KIF27 is a homolog of Drosophila melanogaster
Costal-2, and as such it is expected to participate in the
Hedgehog signaling pathway, but its activity has not
been yet experimentally studied.

Figure 3 A trans-NAT expressed antisense of a pseudogene. (A) Genomic features in a region of human chromosome 3 (negative strand,
coordinates decrease from left to right). EST AI803540 is expressed in this region from positions 75,547,155 to 75,547,600 and represents a transNAT expressed antisense of a pseudogene. Another five ESTs have an identical or very close 3’-end position and support the same antisense
transcript. “Pooled” indicates that the EST was obtained from pooled human melanocyte, fetal heart, and pregnant uterus. (B) This genomic
region is highly identical to the parental gene region in Chromosome 16, from positions 5,068,153 to 5,068,597, as indicated by sequence
alignment (partially represented in the figure). The PAS of the trans-NAT ("AATAAA”, in yellow) is not conserved in the parental gene. (C) The
region of similarity is located in an intron of gene ALG1 and it is antisense of the direction of transcription. No evidence of antisense
transcription was found in this region of the parental gene and some mutations happened in the positions aligning to the PAS of the trans-NAT.

A trans-NAT expressed antisense of a pseudogene whose
3’-end region does not align to the parental gene

AA906308 (277 nt, from a library pooled from fetal
lung, testis, and B-cells) aligns antisense the pseudogene
to chromosome 17 (22,116,782 - 22,117,058) with PAS
“AATAAA” at position 22,117,040. Another 3 ESTs support this trans-NAT 3’ end. It is expressed in antisense
of a processed pseudogene of gene WEE1, and aligns
(with > 90% identity) to exons 9 and 10 of this gene in
chromosome 11 (9,564,608 - 9,564,869) but not to the
intron spanning them. The WEE1 gene encodes the
wee1 tyrosine kinase [20], a key G2 phase cell cycle regulator. AA906308 aligns well to the WEE1 gene except
for its 3’-end. In agreement to this, no evidence of cisNAT expression was found in the parental gene.
Comparisons to other organisms show that this processed pseudogene is also present in chimpanzee (in this
case with two copies in chromosome 17) and orangutan
(three copies in chromosome 17), but not in the rhesus
macaque (Macaca mulatta). Therefore, it seems that
there is selection pressure to generate copies of this
pseudogene in the Hominoidea lineage, and trans-NATs

to WEE1 may exist in other organisms, possibly in multiple copies. The next example, illustrates a case of multiplicity of antisense trans-NATs from multiple
pseudogene copies with more abundant evidence.
An ensemble of trans-NATs expressed antisense of
multiple pseudogene copies

Trans-NATs expressed antisense of pseudogenes can be
duplicated through events of genomic duplication. We
illustrate this with EST AA149869, located in chromosome 17 (42,479,675 - 42,480,254), which represents a
trans-NAT with support from another 15 ESTs from
different tissues (adult eye, fetal, and glioblastoma) that
terminate at the same PAS. AA149869 is highly complementary to nine regions in chromosome 17, five of
them in antisense to introns of four homologous protein
coding genes of uncharacterized function: (LRRC37A3,
LRRC37A2, LRRC37A and LRRC37B) and one pseudogene (LRRC37B2). Therefore this transcript could
potentially regulate four genes. Three of those have evidence of expression of the corresponding antisense cisNAT. Further EST evidence suggests an additional

trans-NAT in chromosome 17 with homology to EST
AA149869. The possible regulatory interactions between
such a matrix of four human genes, three cis-NATs and
two trans-NATs seems complex.
Examination of the genomes of other organisms shows
the existence of equivalents of these pseudogenes in
chromosome 17 of both the chimpanzee and the orangutan, and in chromosome 16 of the rhesus macaque
(Macaca mulatta), and no significant similarity in other
organisms such as the marmoset (a primate) or rodents
(mouse, rat, and guinea pig) (sequences are available as
Additional file 5). The phylogenetic analysis of the pseudogene sequences (not shown) suggests multiple independent replications of this pseudogene along the
Catarrhini lineage.

Discussion
We have collected evidence of the expression of transcripts antisense of pseudogenes, which would be transNATs of the corresponding parental genes. Some of
these transcripts are supported by one single EST and
we do not expect that all transcripts collected will represent true transcripts. However, even though our collection may contain false positives, when considered
collectively our study indicates that these trans-NAT
sequences have higher similarity to their parental genes
in the region 50 nt upstream their 3’ ends. This similarity is distinctively higher than the sequence identity
between pseudogenes and parental genes observed
further upstream that region (Figure 2). This suggests
that many of these transcripts are under selective pressure, evidenced by a mutation rate in that region lower
than in other parts of the pseudogene; one possible
interpretation of this observation is that many of these
trans-NATs are expressed and therefore that pseudogene formation results in the generation of trans-NATs
that could be functional.
Some cases where cis-NAT evidence was found in the
parental gene suggest that a trans-NAT can result from
the pseudogenization of a gene with an already existing
cis-NAT; we found 15 cases where EST evidence shows
that such transcript antisense the parental gene is
expressed. On the contrary, in 17 of the cases analysed,
mutations of the corresponding PAS in the parental
gene suggest that further evolution led to the inactivation of an original cis-NAT while the trans-NAT in the
pseudogene was maintained (Figure 3).
Pseudogene trans-NATs that arise by genetic duplication of entire cis-NATs likely conserve surrounding cisregulatory motifs that control their epigenetic regulation
and their specific expression. Evidence in this direction
is given by the observation that in our selection of pseudogenes with trans-NATs, the fraction of duplicated
pseudogenes is dominant, as opposed to what was

Page 5 of 7

observed for the total set of human pseudogenes we
used as source (See Table 1): formation of a duplicated
pseudogene includes the introns of the gene and is
more likely to include both the cis-NAT and its surrounding control regions.
Ten trans-NATs expressed antisense of pseudogenes
that lack sequence similarity in their 3’-end to the
parental gene suggest an alternative mechanism of
pseudogene trans-NAT production. The example presented (an antisense transcribed from a processed
pseudogene of gene WEE1) has levels of above 90%
identity to the sequence antisense of two consecutive
exons of the parental gene spanning more than 150
nt. The region of the pseudogene corresponding to
the 3’ end of this trans-NAT has no significant similarity to the parental gene. One possibility is that
there was an original cis-NAT in the parental gene
whose 3’-end was deleted after the production of the
pseudogene and the subsequent evolution of the
trans-NAT. Other possibilities are that the trans-NAT
was formed by the insertion of the processed pseudogene on an existing transcription unit or that the
trans-NAT regulatory regions arose de novo for the
pseudogene. At this point, we cannot provide evidence for any of these possibilities.
We have presented examples showing selective pressure acting along the Hominoidea lineage for the duplication of genes and their cis-NATs and trans-NATs in
particular chromosomal regions. Such may result in
ensembles of genes commonly regulated by groups of
NATs generated in their vicinity. Several such regions
with a high rate of local duplications have been
described and their evolution among primates is under
study but it is not yet clear whether they are accidents
of evolution or confer a selective advantage [21].

Conclusions
Our observations support pseudogene formation as a
mechanism of functional trans-NAT generation. Our set
of examples adds evidence for the importance of duplication mechanisms of genetic material for the generation of non-coding RNAs and gives a plausible
explanation for the generation of relatively large complementary transcripts like trans-NATs.

Methods
The genome-wide (Build NCBI 36.1) set of human pseudogenes was obtained from (http://www.pseudogene.
org/ downloaded on 22 Feb 2008) [22]. This version of
the database contained 20,625 pseudogenes. Of those,
20,197 were associated to a parental gene annotated
with an Ensembl gene id http://www.ensembl.org. Of
those, 2,022 (10%) were unprocessed pseudogenes,
10,346 (51%) were processed and 7,829 (39%) were
ambiguous (see Table 1). A total of 4,484 different parental genes were obtained that had a valid Ensembl
gene identifier and a unique location in autosomes 1-22
and chromosomes × and Y.
The EST libraries offer a resource to study the expression of hundreds of thousands of transcripts. It is possible to deduce their relevance and cleavage by analysis of
redundant EST sequences and of genomic PAS [17].
EST cDNA libraries are produced using priming to the
poly-A tail of the transcript and therefore ESTs will generally not represent the totality of the transcript but its
3’ end, up to around 800 nt.
To search for ESTs representing transcripts antisense
to pseudogenes, we selected ESTs from the GenBank
database (through the UCSC Genome Browser; http://
genome.ucsc.edu/) that aligned to any one of the pseudogenes as deduced by alignment (BLAT score/qSize >
= 0.90 and pid > = 90%) of the EST to the genome.
This avoids the need to consider polyA or RNA editing.
We then selected ESTs antisense to the pseudogene.
The sense of the EST was evaluated by the presence of
one of the two strong PAS signals ("AAUAAA” or
“AUUAAA”) within 30 nt of the end of the transcript
[17], splicing signals and cDNA end poly-A tracts. For
the sake of confidence, the PAS is identified in the EST
and also in the antisense sequence of the pseudogene. A
total of 1,044 ESTs where selected using these
conditions.
In order to make sure that the genomic origin of the
ESTs is from the pseudogene, and not from the parental
gene or any other genomic location, we discarded those
that had multiple alignments to the genome according
to the UCSC criteria (with an alignment having a base
identity level within 0.5% of the best and at least 96%
base identity with the genomic sequence). We preserved
349 ESTs. Three further ESTs were eliminated because
the pseudogene overlapped with its parental gene.
We clustered the 346 transcripts according to their
PAS into 182 groups of ESTs ending in the same PAS.
These groups originated from 116 different pseudogenes
corresponding to 103 different parental genes. The EST
in each of the 182 clusters with the best alignment to
the pseudogene (according to UCSC Genome Browser’s
sorting of BLAT results) was chosen as representative.

Page 6 of 7

We aligned the corresponding genomic sequences of
the 182 representative ESTs to their corresponding parental genes using BLAT, and excluded all those that did
not align significantly. We ended up with 87 transNATs located in 61 pseudogenes related to 58 parental
genes (see Additional file 3 and 4: Tables S1 and S2). Of
the pseudogenes, 80% were unprocessed, 15% were processed and 5% were ambiguous (see Table 1). For the
analysis of the distribution of mutations along pseudogenes presented in figure 2 we excluded the 10 cases for
which the region that surrounded the PAS in the pseudogene did not align to the parental gene. These cases
are indicated with a 1 in the column 10 of the Additional file 3: Table S1 and their alignments to the parental can be seen in the Additional file 4: Table S2. In
addition, since we have focused the analysis on the
description of the mutations in the sequence of the
pseudogenes respect to the parental genes, insertions in
the parental gene were not considered.
