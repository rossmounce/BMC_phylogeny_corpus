Abstract
Background: The phylum Verrucomicrobia is a divergent phylum within domain Bacteria including
members of the microbial communities of soil and fresh and marine waters; recently extremely
acidophilic members from hot springs have been found to oxidize methane. At least one genus,
Prosthecobacter, includes species with genes homologous to those encoding eukaryotic tubulins. A
significant superphylum relationship of Verrucomicrobia with members of phylum Planctomycetes
possessing a unique compartmentalized cell plan, and members of the phylum Chlamydiae including
human pathogens with a complex intracellular life cycle, has been proposed. Based on the
postulated superphylum relationship, we hypothesized that members of the two separate phyla
Planctomycetes and Verrucomicrobia might share a similar ultrastructure plan differing from classical
prokaryote organization.
Results: The ultrastructure of cells of four members of phylum Verrucomicrobia – Verrucomicrobium
spinosum, Prosthecobacter dejongeii, Chthoniobacter flavus, and strain Ellin514 – was examined using
electron microscopy incorporating high-pressure freezing and cryosubstitution. These four
members of phylum Verrucomicrobia, representing 3 class-level subdivisions within the phylum, were
found to possess a compartmentalized cell plan analogous to that found in phylum Planctomycetes.
Like all planctomycetes investigated, they possess a major pirellulosome compartment containing
a condensed nucleoid and ribosomes surrounded by an intracytoplasmic membrane (ICM), as well
as a ribosome-free paryphoplasm compartment between the ICM and cytoplasmic membrane.
Conclusion: A unique compartmentalized cell plan so far found among Domain Bacteria only
within phylum Planctomycetes, and challenging our concept of prokaryote cell plans, has now been
found in a second phylum of the Domain Bacteria, in members of phylum Verrucomicrobia. The
planctomycete cell plan thus occurs in at least two distinct phyla of the Bacteria, phyla which have
been suggested from other evidence to be related phylogenetically in the proposed PVC

(Planctomycetes-Verrucomicrobia-Chlamydiae) superphylum. This planctomycete cell plan is present in
at least 3 of 6 subdivisions of Verrucomicrobia, suggesting that the common ancestor of the
verrucomicrobial phylum was also compartmentalized and possessed such a plan. The presence of
this compartmentalized cell plan in both phylum Planctomycetes and phylum Verrucomicrobia suggest
that the last common ancestor of these phyla was also compartmentalized.

Background
The phylum Verrucomicrobia forms a distinct phylogenetically divergent phylum within the domain Bacteria, characterized by members widely distributed in soil and
aquatic habitats. Cells of some species such as Verrucomicrobium spinosum and Prosthecobacter dejongeii possess cellular extensions termed prosthecae and cells of other
strains occur in an ultramicrobacteria size range [1,2]. Verrucomicrobia are significant for our understanding of
both bacterial evolution and microbial ecology. At
present, six monophyletic subdivisions (subphyla,
classes) are recognized within the phylum Verrucomicrobia
on the basis of 16S rRNA gene library studies [3,4]. There
are more than 500 different verrucomicrobia 16S rRNA
gene sequences in publicly-accessible databases, but only
a handful of these represent cultivated strains. The verrucomicrobia pose interesting evolutionary questions –
members of at least one genus, Prosthecobacter, possess
genes for a homolog of eukaryotic tubulin, unknown in
other prokaryotes, along with the bacterial tubulin-like
protein FtsZ. Verrucomicrobium spinosum possesses a FtsZ
divergent from those in other phyla of the domain Bacteria [5-8]. In addition, some members of the verrucomicrobia have been recently found to oxidize methane and use
methane as a sole source of carbon and energy, making
them the only known aerobic methanotrophs outside the
proteobacteria, and the only extreme acidophilic methanotrophs known [9-11]. They are thus significant for our
understanding of the evolution of methanotrophy and C1
transfer biochemistry.
It has recently been proposed that the phyla Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia and Chlamydiae of the domain Bacteria form a superphylum called the PVC superphylum,
which may also include the phyla Poribacteria and Lentisphaerae. The Planctomycetes, Chlamydiae Verrucomicrobia/
Lentisphaerae grouping is supported by 16S and 23S rRNA
sequence analysis [12,13]. Another study based on both
phylogenetics of concatenated protein datasets and
shared conserved inserts in proteins has supported the
link between the phyla Verrucomicrobia and Chlamydiae
[14]. Other studies based on either 16S and 23S rRNA
gene sequences [15], or individual or concatenated protein sequences [16,17], have shown no specific relationships between the three phyla, Verrucomicrobia,
Planctomycetes and Chlamydiae. However, for one of these
studies [15] sequences from some superphylum lineages

were not yet available and thus sequence selection may
have influenced tree topology. In another of these studies
[17], the inability to detect the PVC superphylum may
have resulted from a loss of resolution due to editing concatenated sequence data to allow inclusion of a wide
range of taxa including those of Eukaryotes. It is known
that all members of the phylum Planctomycetes so far
examined possess a characteristic cell plan involving compartmentalization of the cell cytoplasm by an intracytoplasmic membrane (ICM) separating the cytoplasm into
two regions, the inner ribosome-containing pirellulosome and the less central ribosome-free paryphoplasm
[18,19]. The term "pirellulosome" was first introduced to
describe a major nucleoid-containing cell compartment
of planctomycetes bounded by an internal membrane, the
intracytoplasmic membrane (ICM). A ribosome-free
"paryphoplasm" region surrounds the pirellulosome and
is separated from it by the ICM [18]. Based on the proposed relationships between the three lineages, we
hypothesized that members of Planctomycetes and Verrucomicrobia might share a similar ultrastructure plan. This is
investigated in this study using transmission electron
microscopy incorporating techniques such as high pressure freezing, cryosubstitution and freeze fracture, to
examine four verrucomicrobia representing three of the
six subdivisions.

Results
By applying high-pressure freezing, cryosubstitution and
freeze-fracture techniques, internal compartmentalization
of the cell has been observed in four representatives of the
phylum Verrucomicrobia. The four species examined, Verrucomicrobium spinosum, Prosthecobacter dejongeii, Chthoniobacter flavus, and verrucomicrobia strain Ellin514,
represent four genera and three distinct subdivisions (1, 2
and 3) of the phylum. Cells of all four species were examined after high-pressure freezing and cryosubstitution or
after preparation of replicas of freeze-fractured cells. Cells
of all four displayed features that are consistent with compartmentalization of the cell cytoplasm by internal membranes.

bacterium are clearly visible in cells of Verrucomicrobium
spinosum, such as a nucleoid, cytoplasmic membrane
(CM) and a cell wall. However, an internal membrane surrounds a region containing the nucleoid and ribosomelike particles, which thus forms a membrane-bounded
compartment similar to the planctomycete pirellulosome.
This internal membrane has the typical trilaminar structure of a classic bilayer unit membrane seen via electron
microscopy of thin-sectioned cells, i.e., two dense layers
on either sides of an electron-transparent layer. The mean
membrane width (7.0 nm ± 1.1 S.D.) is consistent with
that typical for unit membranes [20]. This pirellulosomelike compartment in V. spinosum is filled with particles
with an electron density and diameter consistent with the
classical characteristics of ribosomes and is surrounded by
a ribosome-free region (i.e., with no electron-dense particles of characteristic diameter and shape) equivalent to
the paryphoplasm cell compartment of planctomycetes
[18]. In most cells, the paryphoplasm is markedly different in texture and electron density to the cytoplasm in the
pirellulosome (Fig. 2). In addition to the major pirellulosome compartment containing the nucleoid, there are
also apparently separate smaller membrane-bounded vesicle-like compartments in some cells (Fig. 2), often seen
within the prosthecal extensions. These do not contain

nucleoid, but are filled with ribosome-like particles. The
texture of the small compartments and the pirellulosome
cytoplasm are similar and this texture differs from that of
the paryphoplasm. These small membrane-bounded
compartments outside the nucleoid-containing pirellulosome may represent extensions of the main pirellulosome, since the cell is only viewed in two-dimensional
section.

fibrillar nucleoid located in the major membranebounded pirellulosome compartment, as indicated by a
high number of gold particles deposited in this region
(Fig. 3). Due to the absence of osmium tetroxide during
cryosubstitution, the paryphoplasm is unstained and relatively electron-transparent in these cells.

Cell compartmentalization in Prosthecobacter dejongeii
Prosthecobacter dejongeii also shares the basic cell plan possessed by the Planctomycetes. A typical prosthecobacter cell
shape and a distinctive prostheca can be easily recognized
in Fig. 4. High-pressure frozen and cryosubstituted preparations of cells of Prosthecobacter dejongeii also revealed
internal compartmentalization consisting of a major single membrane-bounded region containing the fibrillar
nucleoid and all the ribosome-like particles of the cell
(Figs 4, 5). An ICM with a mean width of 5.0 nm ± 0.5
S.D. surrounds and defines this nucleoid- and ribosomecontaining region. In some cells there appeared to be
more than one of these membrane-bounded compartments, but closer examination revealed a connection
between the compartments, which thus appear to represent one major membrane-bounded compartment rather
than separate compartments (Fig. 4). Other regions of the
cell were apparently ribosome-free and formed a cell compartment in between the ICM and the cytoplasmic membrane and cell wall. This compartment is equivalent to the
paryphoplasm of planctomycetes, and in Prosthecobacter

In addition to the compartmentalization by an internal
membrane, Verrucomicrobium spinosum also contains a
condensed fibrillar nucleoid, confined within a localized
region of the pirellulosome. The distinctive multiple prosthecae of Verrucomicrobium spinosum can also be seen (Fig.
1A).
Examination of a freeze-fracture replica of Verrucomicrobium spinosum clearly confirms the presence of a major
intracytoplasmic membrane (ICM) seen in a fracture
along its surface and the presence of a paryphoplasm
external to this ICM (Fig. 1B). Freeze-fracture also clearly
confirms the presence of the cytoplasmic membrane,
which is seen in fracture along its surface as distinct from
the surface-fractured ICM and separated from it by the
cross-fractured paryphoplasm (Fig. 1B).

cells appears to surround the cell rim but also can occur as
regions extending from the cell rim through the cell centre
(Fig. 4 and Fig. 5). These appear to separate membranebounded ribosome-containing regions in cells where several of these appear to occur (Fig. 4 and 5). However, narrow extensions of ribosome-containing cytoplasm seem
to connect such superficially separate membranebounded regions, suggesting there is only one major
membrane-bounded ribosome and nucleoid-containing
organelle. The complexity of the way in which the ICM
can enclose the membrane-bounded ribosome-containing region within the ribosome-free paryphoplasm (that
is, the way in which the paryphoplasm can surround the
ICM) is illustrated in Fig. 5, where there is a large invagination of paryphoplasm at one cell pole and where continuity of this region with the outer rim of paryphoplasm is
apparent. Thus, the underlying topology of the cell plan in
Prosthecobacter is that of a large ribosome- and nucleoidcontaining compartment equivalent to the planctomycete
pirellulosome, bounded by a single ICM membrane separating that compartment from a ribosome-free paryphoplasm.

Cell compartmentalization in Chthoniobacter flavus
In high-pressure frozen and cryosubstituted Chthoniobacter flavus, as in V. spinosum and P. dejongeii, cells were
found to possess two major compartments separated by a
membrane analogous to those characteristic of the planctomycete cell plan. The larger compartment, equivalent to
a planctomycete pirellulosome bounded by the ICM, contains a condensed fibrillar nucleoid that can enclose large
electron-dense granule-like structures (Fig. 7). The smaller
paryphoplasm-equivalent compartment surrounds the
pirellulosome and lies between the ICM and the CM.

In high-pressure frozen and cryosubstituted strain
Ellin514, known to be a representative of subdivision 3 of
the phylum Verrucomicrobia, cells were also found to possess a major pirellulosome compartment separated by an
ICM from an outer paryphoplasm, again analogous to the
planctomycete cell plan (Fig. 8). The pirellulosome compartment possessed a condensed fibrillar nucleoid associated with electron-transparent oval granules, and was
filled with polyhedral bodies of varying electron density.
Ribosomes were not clearly visible and the polyhedral
bodies seem to occupy most of the pirellulosome.

We have demonstrated that all four members of the phylum Verrucomicrobia examined, Verrucomicrobium spinosum, Prosthecobacter dejongeii, Chthoniobacter flavus, and
verrucomicrobia strain Ellin514, share a basic cell plan
analogous to that found in members of the phylum Planctomycetes. This cell plan is characterized by compartmentalization of the cell cytoplasm by a major cell organelle
bounded by a single membrane containing all the cell
DNA in a fibrillar condensed nucleoid, as well as ribosome-like particles. This major membrane-bounded
organelle is equivalent to the pirellulosome of planctomycetes, and its bounding membrane is equivalent to the
intracytoplasmic membrane (ICM) defined in planctomycetes as surrounding the pirellulosome [18]. Consistent with the structural analogies between verrucomicrobia
and planctomycetes, the ribosome-free region between
the ICM of the pirellulosome and the cytoplasmic membrane in verrucomicrobia can be considered equivalent to
the paryphoplasm of planctomycetes. The verrucomicrobial cell plan is most similar to the simplest planctomycete cell plan seen in Pirellula staleyi, Blastopirellula marina
[18] and Rhodopirellula baltica. There is no indication of a
single membrane-bounded organelle not containing a
nucleoid such as the anammoxosome of anaerobic
ammonium-oxidizing bacteria, a group thought to represent some of the most deep-branching Planctomycetes or
even a separate phylum-level lineage within the PVC
superphylum [21,22] and which share a cell plan including the pirellulosome with planctomycetes [23-25]. However, the small membrane-bounded regions of ribosomecontaining pirellulosome cytoplasm within paryphoplasm in V. spinosum resemble features of a pirellula-like
planctomycete cultured from a Mediterranean sponge
[26]. The cell plan determined in verrucomicrobia was
revealed using a cryosubstitution method for preparation
of cells before thin-sectioning for electron microscopy, a
method comparable to those used previously for establishing the planctomycete cell plan [18,27].
Cells of all the species of verrucomicrobia examined here
using high-pressure freezing followed by cryosubstitution
also possess condensed nucleoids, which is another feature of similarity to the ultrastructure of planctomycetes.
All planctomycetes appear to possess condensed nucleoids when cryofixed cryosubstituted cells are examined
[18]. Cryosubstitution, unlike conventional chemical fixation, is not expected to yield such condensation as an
artifact of fixation [28-30]. This contrasts with the appearance of nucleoids in cryofixed cells of other bacterial species such as Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, where a
'coralline' nucleoid extending through the cell cytoplasm
is found [28,29]. Chromatin-like nucleoids have been
reported in "Candidatus Xiphinematobacter", symbionts

BMC Microbiology 2009, 9:5

of nematodes belonging subdivision 2 of Verrucomicrobia
[4], and also in epixenosome symbionts belonging to subdivision 4 [31], although in both cases these were examined only using chemical fixation. The condensed
nucleoids of all the species examined here often contained
granules of varying electron density. Such granules within
nucleoids have been noted to occur within cryo-fixed cells
of Deinococcus radiodurans vitreous sections examined by
cryoelectron microscopy [32].
V. spinosum and P. dejongeii are members of subdivision 1
(class Verrucomicrobiae) of the phylum Verrucomicrobia [1].
There is another member of the phylum Verrucomicrobia,
Rubritalea squalenifaciens, isolated from the marine sponge
Halichondria okadai and belonging to subdivision 1 Verrucomicrobia, which seems to possess the planctomycete-like
cell plan in an accompanying published figure, but this
interpretation was not made by the authors [33]. The
planctomycete cell plan has also been observed in symbiont bacteria studied directly in sponge tissue [34]. Some
of those from the sponge Haliclona caerulea include cells
with multiple prosthecae and in which both ICM and
riboplasm were recognized [35]. These bacteria may be
verrucomicrobia or prosthecate alphaproteobacteria, with
the ultrastructure suggesting the former. At least 3 species
of verrucomicrobial subdivision 1 thus appear to possess
the planctomycete cell plan. C. flavus is a member of subdivision 2 (class Spartobacteria) [36], and Ellin514 is a
member of subdivision 3 [37] so that we have determined
the planctomycete cell plan to be present in at least 3 distinct subdivisions of the phylum Verrucomicrobia. This cell
plan may occur widely among distinct subdivisions of the
phylum Verrucomicrobia, which could suggest that the
common ancestor of the verrucomicrobial phylum was
also compartmentalized and possessed such a plan. The
planctomycete cell plan thus occurs in at least two distinct
phyla of the Bacteria. These phyla have been suggested to
be related phylogenetically in the so-called PVC superphylum [12,38]. Members of the phylum Poribacteria, also
postulated to belong to the PVC superphylum, have been
proposed to be compartmentalized [38], and our electron
microscopy examination of thin sections of cells of Lentisphaera araneosa, prepared via high-pressure freezing
(unpublished data), indicates that at least one member of
the phylum Lentisphaerae within the PVC superphylum
[39] also possesses compartmentalized cells with the
planctomycete plan. This plan seems to be shared by
members of the PVC superphylum, and it is possible that
a common compartmentalized ancestor of the superphylum may have shared the planctomycete cell plan. Other
proposed members of the superphylum, such as members
of the phylum Chlamydiae, should also be examined for
such a cell plan. Interestingly, Parachlamydia acanthamoeba, a chlamydial organism which occurs as an
endosymbiont of free-living amoebae, possesses one stage

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/5

of its life cycle, the crescent body, which seems to display
internal membranes and a cell plan in thin sections consistent with verrucomicrobial and planctomycete plans
[40], but this needs to be confirmed using cryo-fixation
preparative methods.
Chemically fixed cells of extremely acidophilic methanotrophic members of the phylum Verrucomicrobia forming
a new subdivision within the phylum have been reported
to possess unusual internal structures, including polyhedral bodies and tubular membranes, when thin sections
are viewed by transmission electron microscopy [9,10]. It
is not possible from those micrographs to deduce any
clear relationship of these structures to a planctomycete
cell plan, but it is possible that when these strains are prepared by high-pressure freezing they will also be shown to
possess such a plan. The internal membrane structures
seen sometimes in cells of the methanotrophic verrucomicrobial strain V4 have been suggested to house particulate
methane monooxygenase enzymes, as in other known
methanotrophs. However, the occurrence of intracytoplasmic membrane similar to those of planctomycetes
and in the chemoheterotrophically-grown verrucomicrobia strains studied here suggest that verrucomicrobial
internal membranes need not always be associated with a
particular metabolism.
The structure of 'epixenosome' verrucomicrobia symbionts of the ciliate Euplotidium, members of subdivision 4
of verrucomicrobia, is complex and there has been no suggestion of compartmentalization by internal membranes.
However, these cells have so far only been examined by
chemical fixation [31]. The structure of the cells of these
organisms should be re-examined via cryo-fixation based
techniques to determine their consistency with the model
proposed here for the verrucomicrobial cell plan, since it
is possible that the complex structures found may be
accompanied by internal membranes when methods
more suitable for their preservation are used.

Conclusion
A unique cell plan so far found only within the phylum
Planctomycetes of the Domain Bacteria, and which challenges our concept of the prokaryote cell plan, has now
been found in a second bacterial phylum – phylum Verrucomicrobia. The planctomycete cell plan thus occurs in at
least two distinct phyla of the Bacteria, phyla which have
been suggested from other evidence to be related phylogenetically as members of the proposed PVC superphylum.
This planctomycete cell plan is present in at least 3 of the
6 subdivisions of the Verrucomicrobia, suggesting that the
common ancestor of the verrucomicrobial phylum was
also compartmentalized and possessed such a plan. The
presence of this compartmentalized cell plan in both phylum Planctomycetes and phylum Verrucomicrobia suggests

BMC Microbiology 2009, 9:5

that the last common ancestor of these phyla was also
compartmentalized. Cell compartmentalization of this
type may thus have significant meaning phylogenetically,
and can act as a clue to the meaning of deeper evolutionary relationships between bacterial phyla. Its occurrence
in a second phylum of domain Bacteria extends and reinforces the challenge to the concept of prokaryotic organization already posed by planctomycete cell organization.
Definitions of the prokaryote depending on absence of
membrane-bounded organelles may require further reexamination, a process already underway [41-43]. Such
compartmentalized cell plans may have phylogenetic and
evolutionary significance of relevance to such problems as
the origin of cell compartmentalization in eukaryotes and
the origin of the eukaryotic nucleus. In summary, the cell
plan shared by all members of the phylum Planctomycetes
so far examined appears also to be shared by several members of the phylum Verrucomicrobia, suggesting that such a
plan may be common to these distinct bacterial phyla,
and that the common ancestor of these relatively closely
related phyla may have also possessed this plan.

Methods
Bacteria and culture conditions
Verrucomicrobium spinosum was grown on MMB medium
[44] and incubated aerobically at 28°C. Prosthecobacter
dejongeii and Chthoniobacter flavus were grown on DM agar
medium [45] both incubated aerobically at 28°C. Strain
Ellin514 was grown in VL55 broth medium and incubated aerobically at 28°C [46].
High-pressure freezing and cryosubstitution
Bacteria cultures were high-pressure frozen with liquid
nitrogen using a BalTec HPM-010 or a Leica EMPACT 2
high-pressure freezer. The frozen samples were kept and
stored in a 2-ml tube containing liquid nitrogen before
cryosubstitution was carried out.

The frozen sample was transferred to a microfuge tube
containing 2% (wt/vol) osmium tetroxide in acetone and
cryosubstituted in a Leica AFS. The sample was warmed
from -160°C to -85°C over 1.9 h (rate 40°C/h), held at 85°C for 36 h, then warmed from -85°C to 20°C over 11
h (4°C/h). The high-pressure frozen and cryosubstituted
samples were then processed into EPON resin and
ultrathin-sectioned using a Leica Ultracut Ultramicrotome
UC61. The cut sections were placed onto a formvar-coated
copper grid and stained with 5% (wt/vol) uranyl acetate
in 50% ethanol and with lead citrate.
Freeze fracture
Verrucomicrobium spinosum cells were swabbed off a plate
and resuspended in 20% (vol/vol) glycerol for 1 hr. After
rapid freezing, cells were freeze-fractured using a Balzers
BAF 300 Unit. Fracturing was performed at -120°C, and 3

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/5

nm of platinum/carbon was shadowed onto the samples
at an angle of 45°. A 25 nm layer of carbon was then evaporated on top of this. Samples were taken from the freeze
fracture unit and thawed. The replicas were cleaned in
25% chromic acid for 3 days, rinsed 3 times in distilled
water and picked up onto 200 mesh copper grids.
Immunolabelling of double-stranded DNA
Ultrathin-sections of high-pressure frozen and cryosubstituted V. spinosum and P. dejongeii cells on carbon-coated
copper grids were floated onto drops of Block solution
containing 0.2% (wt/vol) fish skin gelatin, 0.2% (wt/vol)
BSA, 200 mM glycine and 1 × PBS on a sheet of Parafilm,
and treated for 1 min at 150 W in a Biowave microwave
oven. The grids were then transferred onto 8 μl of primary
antibody, (mouse monoclonal IgG anti-double-stranded
DNA (abcam) diluted 1:500 in Block solution), and
treated in the microwave at 150 W, for 2 min with microwave on, 2 min off, and 2 min on. The grids were then
washed on drops of Block solution 3 times, and treated
each time for 1 min in the microwave at 150 W, before
being placed on 8 μl of goat anti-mouse IgG 10 nm-colloidal gold antibody (ProSciTech) diluted 1:50 in Block solution and treated in the microwave at 150 W, for 2 min
with microwave on, 2 min off, and 2 min on. Grids were
washed 3 times in 1 × PBS, each time being treated for 1
min each in the microwave at 150 W, and 4 times in water
for 1 min each in the microwave at 150 W. The grids were
dried and stained with 1% (wt/vol) aqueous uranyl acetate. Three negative controls were carried out for this
experiment. Firstly, anti-GFP antibody, an antibody
which targeted an antigen not expected to occur in Verrucomicrobia, was used as the primary antibody. Secondly,
the block solution with no antibody of any type was used
in place of the primary antibody. Thirdly, sections were
treated with DNase before the labeling procedures. Two
replicates per species were performed for the immunogold
labeling experiment.
Transmission electron microscopy
All high-pressure frozen and cryosubstituted sections and
freeze-fracture replicas were viewed using a JEOL 1010
transmission electron microscope operated at 80 kV.
Images were captured using iTEM 5.0 universal TEM
image platform software. The resulting files were annotated and resolution adjusted for final image production
using Photoshop CS.
