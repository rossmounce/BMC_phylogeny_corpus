Anthrax phylogenetic structure in Northern Italy
Giuliano Garofolo1*, Luigina Serrecchia1, Michela Corrò2 and Antonio Fasanella1

Abstract
Background: Anthrax has almost disappeared from mainland Europe, except for the Mediterranean region where
cases are still reported. In Central and South Italy, anthrax is enzootic, but in the North there are currently no high
risk areas, with only sporadic cases having been registered in the last few decades. Regional genetic and molecular
characterizations of anthrax in these regions are still lacking. To investigate the potential molecular diversity of
Bacillus anthracis in Northern Italy, canonical Single nucleotide polymorphism (canSNP) and Multilocus variable
number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) genotyping was performed against all isolates from animal outbreaks
registered in the last twenty years in the region.
Findings: Six B. anthracis strains were analyzed. The canSNP analysis indicates the presence of three sublineages/
subgroups each of which belong to one of the 12 worldwide CanSNP genotypes: B.Br.CNEVA (3 isolates), A.Br.005/
006 (1 isolates) and A.008/009 (2 isolate). The latter is the dominant canSNP genotype in Italy. The 15-loci MLVA
analysis revealed five different genotypes among the isolates.
Conclusions: The major B branch and the A.Br.005/006 were recovered in the Northeast region. The genetic
structure of anthrax discovered in this area differs from the rest of the country, suggesting the presence of a
separate and independent B. anthracis molecular evolution niche. Although the isolates analyzed in this study are
limited in quantity and representation, these results indicate that B. anthracis genetic diversity changes around the
Alps.

Introduction
Bacillus anthracis, the etiological agent responsible for
anthrax, is a Gram-positive spore-forming bacterium.
The disease affects many wild and domesticated animals,
and all mammals are potentially susceptible to infection
[1]. Its virulence properties characterize the course of
the disease, which typically is rapidly lethal for the host,
particularly in herbivorous mammals [2]. Humans are
less susceptible and are considered incidental hosts, but
the zoonotic potential of anthrax is well known [3]. Epidemiological data demonstrate that anthrax is now rare
in Italy. However, during the period 1969-1997, 27
human deaths were registered across the country [4],
indicating a natural endemic area. Improved sanitation,
systematic use of the vaccine by veterinarians [5] and
new breeding systems have contributed to a drastic
reduction in the incidence of the disease in Italy. No
human deaths have been reported since 1997. Today in

Italy anthrax predominantly affects livestock in pastures
in the Southern regions, but is infrequent in the Northern regions [6,7].
The study

Molecular diversity in Italian strains of B. anthracis was
initially studied in 2005 using eight variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) loci [6], primarily to investigate
strains from the Anthrax Reference Institute of Italy
repository, which covers South and Central Italy. Highly
resolving molecular techniques have now been developed that allow the phylo-geographic patterns of
anthrax to be understood better [8,9]. Local knowledge
of anthrax is vastly improved [10-12]. In recent years,
outbreaks have been recorded in the Northeastern [13]
and Northern [14] regions of Italy. Unfortunately,
because of the ephemeral cycles of this disease, it is not
always possible to establish the full extent of anthrax
distribution in specific regions. However, analysis of natural anthrax epidemics can provide insights into the
relationship between patterns of spread and genetic

changes that have accumulated over time in these
regions.
In 2005, on a typical alpine farm in the province of
Bolzano, an outbreak involved two cattle, four goats and
one sheep, and one suspected human case. In 2006,
there was a bovine anthrax case in the province of Belluno in the Italian Alps, and in 2008 nine cattle died
from anthrax in a 10 day period in the Mugello region
in the province of Florence (Tuscany). One strain was
isolated from each of the above outbreaks.
The phylogenetic relationship between these isolates
and other archival Italian isolates was determined using
13 canonical SNPs (canSNPs) and 15 VNTR markers
(MLVA15) as described by Van Ert et al. [15]. The
archived samples included two strains from the province
of Verona (Veneto), from outbreaks occurred in 1992
and 1995, and one from the province of Pavia (Lombardy), from a 1989 outbreak (Figure 1). These additional samples allowed a more comprehensive
comparison to be carried out and provided an improved
phylo-geographic pattern concerning the incidence of
anthrax in northern Italy.
The analysis (Table 1) demonstrated that Northern
Italy has three different sub-lineages/sub-groups of the
12 worldwide canSNP genotypes previously described
by Van Ert et al. The CanSNP analysis showed that
isolate 050 (Verona) belonged to sub-group 005/006 in
the A lineage and that the three isolates, 049 (Verona),
187 (Bolzano) and 188 (Belluno), belonged to the subgroup B.Br. CNEVA in the smaller B lineage. Isolates,
187 and 188, were isolated at different sites but have
the same MLVA type, although they differ from isolate
049 from Verona (Table 2). The isolates 145 (Florence)
and 183 (Pavia) belonged to CanSNP sub-group A.

Br.008/009 but had two different MLVA types (Tables
1 and 2).

Discussion and conclusion
Fasanella et al. [6] suggested that the dominant phylogenetic group in Italy belongs to the previously described
Cluster A1.a [16], which is now classified as part of the
sub-group A.Br.008/009 [15], also known as the Trans
Euro Asian (TEA) group, in the A lineage. Our datum is
consistent with the overall presence of this particular
sub-group throughout the majority of Europe and
regions of Asia [10]. In the regions of Tuscany and
Lombardy, the TEA group was recovered indicating that
it belongs to the major Italian sub-group. We also identified two new MLVA genotypes (Table 2) which are
not present in the Italian database (data not shown).
While these relatively “modern” isolates do not necessarily represent a diverse A.Br.008/009 sub-group, they do
reinforce the hypothesis that the TEA sub-group in Italy
constitutes part of the historical spread of anthrax
across Europe and Asia [10].
The results also demonstrate that in a relatively small
area in Northeast Italy, unique genotypes were recovered from the major B. anthracis worldwide clonal A
and B lineages. These isolates were distinctive from the
A.Br.008/009 TEA branch that dominates throughout
Europe and Asia. These data suggest that the Italian
Alps may share a unique environmental niche and
phylo-geographic pattern representative of the B.Br.
CNEVA sub-group (previously identified as B2 cluster
[16]). This proposition is supported by reports that this
lineage is present in the French Alps [17], Germany and
Croatia [15]. Isolates from the B.Br.CNEVA (B2) subgroup are almost entirely restricted to Europe. This may
indicate the presence of a common environment or corridor that could have allowed this unusual lineage to
persist in livestock and wildlife in the French and Italian
Alps. A small number of naturally occurring isolates
may represent previous “anthrax regions”, where a lineage may have continued to recycle over long periods of
time despite the lack of incidents in the more visible
domesticated populations. In addition, the identification
of two new MLVA15 types among the three strains analyzed from the B.Br. CNEVA lineage with three alleles
of difference may suggest a longer history for this lineage in the area, although only SNP analysis based on
whole genome sequencing could confirm this
hypothesis.
More puzzling is the recent discovery of the A.Br.
005/006 sub-group in Northeast of Italy, which suggests
that the history of anthrax in Italy is complex and is
likely to have involved the introduction and re-introduction of this disease through repeated human activity led
by the trading of commodities. This sub-group is well

Numbers of tandem repeats in each locus for Bacillus anthracis isolates are reported. The copy numbers for each locus are calculated as (amplicon size -offset)/
repeat size. The amplicon sizes were determined and calculated using ABI 3130 genetic analyzer and rounded with GeneMapper software using a binning code
from the Italian genotype database. Offset and repeat sizes are available online [18]http://minisatellites.u-psud.fr/GPMS/.

represented in Africa but rare in Europe. Its presence in
the Northeastern territories of Italy could be related to
trade exchanges dating back to the Maritime Republics
period (Middle Ages), when city states competed for
trade and commerce throughout the Mediterranean.
This highlights the possibility that this rare, predominantly African, lineage could have become present in
this small region of Italy owing to an oddity in how
goods were traded from Africa to Northern Italy.
It is particularly interesting that, in a small area of
Northeast Italy, B. anthracis presents with major genetic
variability, suggesting the presence of a different environment that permits rare and unusual lineages to
survive.
