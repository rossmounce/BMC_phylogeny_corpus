Abstract
Background: The dynamics of gene evolution are influenced by several genomic processes. One
such process is retrotransposition, where an mRNA transcript is reverse-transcribed and
reintegrated into the genomic DNA.
Results: We have surveyed eight vertebrate genomes (human, chimp, dog, cow, rat, mouse,
chicken and the puffer-fish T. nigriviridis), for putatively retrotransposed copies of genes. To gain a
complete picture of the role of retrotransposition, a robust strategy to identify putative retrogenes
(PRs) was derived, in tandem with an adaptation of previous procedures to annotate processed
pseudogenes, also called retropseudogenes (RψGs). Mammalian genomes are estimated to contain
400–800 PRs (corresponding to ~3% of genes), with fewer PRs and RψGs in the non-mammalian
vertebrates. Focussing on human and mouse, we aged the PRs, analysed for evidence of
transcription and selection pressures, and assigned functional categories. The PRs have significantly
less transcription evidence mappable to them, are significantly less likely to arise from alternativelyspliced genes, and are statistically overrepresented for ribosomal-protein genes, when compared
to the proteome in general. We find evidence for spurts of gene retrotransposition in human and
mouse, since the lineage of either species split from the dog lineage, with >200 PRs formed in mouse
since its divergence from rat. To examine for selection, we calculated: (i) Ka/Ks values (ratios of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions in codons), and (ii) the significance of conservation of
reading frames in PRs. We found >50 PRs in both human and mouse formed since divergence from
dog, that are under pressure to maintain the integrity of their coding sequences. For different
subsets of PRs formed at different stages of mammalian evolution, we find some evidence for nonneutral evolution, despite significantly less expression evidence for these sequences.
Conclusion: These results indicate that retrotranspositions are a significant source of novel
coding sequences in mammalian gene evolution.

Background
Genes are subject to many different processes that give rise
to novel sequences, such as segmental and local duplication, gene conversion, and retrotransposition. The extent

to which these different processes contribute to gene evolution is unclear. In the present paper, we focus on the
phenomenon of gene retrotransposition. Retrotransposition
entails the reverse transcription of an mRNA transcript

and the subsequent re-integration of the resulting cDNA
into genomic DNA, in germ-line cells [1]. There is substantial genomic evidence for large-scale retrotransposition of mRNAs in mammalian genomes, from detection
of thousands of apparent retropseudogenes in human,
mouse and rat [2-4]. Such retropseudogenes (RψGs) are
decayed or disabled gene sequence copies (typically bearing frameshifts and stop codons) that demonstrate the
hallmark characteristics of retrotransposition, namely lack
of introns of the parental gene, and also 3' polyadenine
tails, if formed more recently [5]. Other features include
short direct repeats flanking the sequence (for young retrotranspositions) [6], frequent 5' truncations, and
genomic location different from that of the parent gene
[2,3]. It has been demonstrated experimentally that RψGs
can be formed through the action of LINE-1 reverse transcriptases [7]. The computational comparison of LINEs
and RψGs also supports the generation of RψGs by LINEs
[8]. The poly(A) tails and frequent truncations found at
the 5' end in the RψGs are typical for LINEs [2]. Moreover,
they share similar structures, including a common
TT|AAAA insertion motif [8].
Since the substantial majority of these retrosequences bear
disablements (frameshifts and stop codons), or have
codon substitution patterns indicative of decay [9,5,3],
gene retrotransposition appears generally to lead to nonfunctional sequences that decay in the genomic DNA as
evolution progresses [10,2,9]. However, even though the
promoters of these gene retrosequences are not transferred, a small minority of them appears to be transcribed
[11]. For the human genome, there is a small population
of at least ~200 transcribed processed pseudogenes, which
have the symptoms of a lack of coding ability despite evidence of transcription, and are significantly likely to be
found near others genes (as would be expected if they are
co-opting promoters) [11].
Generation of a new functional gene is also a possible outcome of retrotransposition [10]. There is an increasing
number of transcribed, functionally characterized genes
in mammalian and invertebrate animal genomes reported
to bear the characteristics of retrosequences [12]. Over
ninety such retrogenes have been annotated in the human
and mouse genomes [13]. Most of the functional retrogenes identified are expressed in testis and may have provided important raw material for rapid testis evolution in
primates [12].
Here, to derive an overview of the role of gene retrotransposition in the genome evolution of vertebrates, and particularly mammals, we derive and apply a robust procedure to
annotate gene retrotranspositions, built on our previous
analyses of retropseudogenes [11,3,2,14]. Our strategy
incorporates a new rapid procedure for annotating retro-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/308

copies in the genomic DNA, in tandem with a pipeline to
identify them in existing gene annotations. This PR annotation pipeline incorporates aging of the sequences
through evolutionary rate analysis relative to putative parents and their orthologs, as well as analysis of the chromosomal milieus of these sequences and their putative
parents. We find evidence for, on average, several hundred
PRs in each proteome. Focussing on human and mouse,
we find evidence for spurts of gene retrotransposition in
both human and mouse, since divergence from dog. A
small number (>50) of PRs have formed in both mouse
and human since divergence form dog, that show signs of
being under selection to maintain their coding sequences.

Methods
Genome data
The genome sequences and annotations of seven organisms analyzed in this paper (human, dog, cow, mouse, rat,
chicken and Tetraodon nigriviridis), were downloaded
from the Ensembl Web site [15], in January 2005. Version
2.1 of the chimpanzee assembly (downloaded in April
2006) was also used. Putative retrogenes (PRs) were identified in the annotated proteomes of eight vertebrates
using the pipeline in Figure 1. This procedure is described
in detail below. In tandem, putative retropseudogenes
(RψGs), and additional PRs outside of current protein
annotations, were assigned using a modification of previous procedures (Figures 1 &2) [14,2]. Genes from which
PRs and RψGs are thought to have originated are called
parent genes.
Rapid identification of retropseudogenes (RψGs)
Retropseudogenes were annotated on the Ensembl
genome versions used in this present analysis, using the
rapid improvement of previous procedures to identify retropseudogenes described above (summarised in Figure 2)
[11,5,14,2,3].
Identification of putative retrotransposed genes (PRs)
(1) Homology detection: Each proteome was compared
against itself using BLAST to find similarities with e-value
≤ 10-4 [16]. Any match to a potential pseudogene contaminant in the proteome annotations was removed (Figure
1).

(2) Exon seam analysis: Exon boundary information for
each protein was extracted from the appropriate Ensembl
genome annotation files. The positioning of exon boundaries in encoded protein sequences, i.e., 'exon seams', was
then deduced [11]. Using the positioning of exon seams,
the BLAST matches between proteins were filtered to pick
out alignments between a protein encoded by a multipleexon gene, and a single exon of another gene. To define
PRs, the length of the exon was required to be between 0.9
and 1.1 of the whole length of the multiple-exon protein.

value ≤ 10-4 over ≥ 0.5 of the length of the OR, since recent
olfactory receptors (ORs) have probably originated from
different mechanism other than retrotransposition [2].
Olfactory receptor sequences were taken from ORDB [18].

tests for local gene order and chromosomal milieu.

(This is stricter than the criterion of 0.7 of the length used
for annotation of retropseudogenes [2]).
(3) Assignment of parent genes: To assign parent genes to
PRs, we calculated substitution rates at synonymous
codon sites (i.e., Ks values) for all matches to PRs using the
package PAML, for all instances where the amino-acid
sequence identity for the pair of sequences is ≥ 70%. The
sequence with the smallest Ks value was chosen as the
'parent gene'. For sequence identities <70%, saturation of
substitutions is likely [17], and so the sequence with the
highest BLAST bitscore in alignment with the PR was chosen as the putative parent.
(4) Additional filtering: In addition, PRs were discarded if
they matched olfactory receptors (ORs) with BLAST e-

(5) Local gene order test for similarity of the chromosomal
milieus for PRs and parent genes: To check that the PRs did
not arise from local or segmental duplication, we derived
a 'local gene order' test. For this test, we compared the
chromosomal milieus of PRs and parents for significant
similarity, as follows. Proteins encoded by genes adjacent
to PRs in the chromosomes were BLASTed against the corresponding proteins from genes adjacent to putative parents, for a given window (wgenes) of number of genes in
either direction (5' and 3'). A wgenes size of 7 (the PR or parent, plus 3 genes in either direction), with an allowance
for one gap between the positions of matches within
wgenes, was found to be suitable. The number of significant
homologous matches Nhomologs (BLAST e-value ≤ 10-4,
sequence identity >40%, and match ≥ 0.6 length of both
PR and parent) between the milieus of PR and parent was
tallied. An expected benchmark distribution for Nhomologs
was derived for the chromosomal milieus of 1,000 randomly-sampled pairs of proteins that have any significant
BLAST match to each other (e-value ≤ 10-4). From examination of this distribution, we found that 80% of such
random pairs have Nhomologs <1, and 87% have Nhomologs ≤ 1.
We thus chose Nhomologs = 1, as a suitable threshold for local
similarity arising from duplication of genomic DNA.
However, the results differ little if a threshold of Nhomologs
= 0 is used. This procedure was applied to the genomes of
the human and mouse. Interestingly, application of this
criterion resulted in the exclusion of many sequences with
large individual exons (PRs with FLEparent ≥ 0.8; 36/86 =
42% of those excluded), that may be false positives in our
data set of PRs. A large fraction of these sequences (68%)
tend to have long, tandem arrays of Zn-finger domains
covering more than a third of their sequences (Additional
File 1).
Additional filtering and annotation
The following additional analysis was performed on the
PRs:

(i) Fraction of largest exon in parent: We calculated the fraction of the length any parent gene that is taken up by its
largest exon. This is denoted FLEparent. We found that there
is no peculiar tendency for the parents of PRs to have a single large exon (which would yield a tendency for high FLE
values) [Additional File 1].
(ii) Overlap with retropseudogenes annotations: Retropseudogenes were annotated on the Ensembl genome versions
used in this present analysis, using the rapid improvement
of previous procedures to identify retro(pseudo)genes

described above. Any PR that overlapped one of these
annotations was flagged (Table 1).

The bi-directional best hits method is a common procedure for guarding against considering paralogs.

(iii) Filtering for potential transposable elements (TEs): Each
proteome was compared using TBLASTN to libraries of
transposable elements taken from the RepeatMasker distribution [19], using an e-value threshold of ≤ 10-4. Any
proteins containing SINEs, or near-complete matches to
LINEs (≥ 0.8 of their lengths), were labeled as potentially
TE-containing.

Analysis of Ks and Ka/Ks values, and derivation of genomeand lineage-specific gene lists
The package PAML [20] was used to calculate maximumlikelihood Ka, Ks and Ka/Ks values for pairs of sequences
(either PR versus computed ancestral sequences, or PR versus parent). In addition, branch-specific maximum-likelihood Ka/Ks values were calculated for three-way
alignments of PR, parent and parent's orthologs from
another close species.

(iv) Whether single-exon gene or multiple-exon gene: The PRs
were labeled as either single-exon genes or part of multipleexon genes.
Orthologs
Orthologs of parent genes were identified using the bidirectional best hits method, using BLAST (e-value ≤ 10-4,
amino-acid sequence identity ≥ 40% and requiring the
alignment to cover ≥ 0.6 of the lengths of each sequence.

We applied three different strategies based on analysis of
Ks, to determine lists of genome-specific and lineage-specific PRs. For example, for the human genome, we calculated human-specific lists relative to the chimpanzee
genome. Also, we calculated primate-specific lists for
human plus chimpanzee, relative to a mammalian outgroup, such as dog or cow. To determine genome-specific
lists of PRs, we investigated each of the following three

(1) The distribution of Ks values for orthologous genes in
the two organisms was calculated, and the median value

ortholog])/2 ;
Lineage-specific lists were derived in a similar fashion.
Additional File 2 shows how these three methods overlap
which each other. Based on the overlaps observed, we
used Method (3) for further analysis.
Analysis of reading frame conservation
We assessed the reading frame conservation (RFC) in
sequences using simulations of insertion and deletion
governed by power-law insertion/deletion (indel) statistics [4]. Power-law statistics for indels were extracted from
recently-formed RΨGs having ≥ 85% amino-acid identity
with their parent sequences. Power-law relationships were
fitted, omitting points for any indels of size 3n, with n any
positive integer. Expected ratios for insertions versus deletions were taken from this data; the expected number of
indels per nucleotide substitution for several mammals

was culled from the literature [21,22]. The program
DNADIST [23] was used to calculate the nucleotide-level
divergence of the PRs from ancestral sequences (calculated using PAML [20]; see section on Ka/Ks analysis
above). This divergence value is used as a target in simulations. For each PR, repeated simulations of the evolution
of the ancestral sequence towards present-day, for 1000
iterations, was performed using a Kimura two-parameter
model. In each case, the resulting simulated protein coding sequence was marked for frame disablements (stop
codons and frameshifts). PR sequences whose simulations yielded frame-disrupted sequences ≥ 99% of the
time were labeled as having significant RFC.
Assignment of functional categories
GO (Gene Ontology; [24]) functional categories were
taken from the annotation files provided on the Ensembl
[15] and Gene Ontology websites [25]. Further GO term
annotations were derived by mapping functional GO
annotations for the PDB (also downloaded from the GO
website) onto Ensembl protein annotations, using 50%
sequence identity and 0.8 fractional sequence coverage
(for the protein domain) as thresholds, using alignment
made by the program BLASTP (e-value ≤ 0.0001) [16].
These thresholds were benchmarked on the complete
SCOP protein domain sequence database [26], to give a
2% false positive rate for GO term transfer.
Mapping of cDNAs/mRNAs
Refseq mRNAs and complete Unigene consensus
sequences were downloaded from the NCBI website [27],
for both human and mouse. These were mapped to the
coding sequences of Ensembl gene annotations, using

particular, we focused on the mammals, to analyse the
ages of putative retrogenes (PRs), to derive genome- and
lineage-specific lists and to check for spurts of gene retrotransposition activity. We then examined for evidence of
transcription (mRNA and cDNA mapping), involvement
in alternative splicing, selection pressures (significant Ka/
Ks values and reading-frame conservation), and for functional categorizations of parent genes.

sequence identity over ≥ 0.99 of the sequence length of
the cDNA or mRNA, after removal of any polyadenylation, were retained. Further restriction of analysis of
cDNA/mRNA mappings to those that do not match their
putative parent sequences with >95% sequence identity,
does not change the trends reported with regard to transcription evidence reported below.

Results and discussion
The pipelines for annotating the complement of gene retrotranspositions (both retropseudogenes (RψGs) and putative retrogenes (PRs)) were applied to eight vertebrates. In

Overview of gene retrotranspositions in vertebrates
Our analysis suggests that up to ~3% of the genes encoded
in a vertebrate genome contain a PR (Table 1), with the
smallest percentages in the chicken and puffer fish T.
nigroviridis. By comparison, mammalian genomes have
~2,000–5,000 retropseudogenes (RψGs), that have at
least 70% of the coding sequence of their parent genes,
again with smaller numbers in non-mammal vertebrates
(just 644 RψGs in T. nigroviridis) (Table 1). These results
together indicate that there has been less, recent gene-retrotransposition activity in the two non-mammal vertebrates. These observations tally well with other evidence
for less retrotransposition activity in chicken and Tetraodon. In chicken, there appear to be little or no SINEs [28],
and only ~8% of the genomic DNA is comprised of the
CR1 ('chicken repeat 1') LINE-1 [28,29], whose reverse
transcriptase is thought not to copy polyadenylated
mRNAs [29]. In Tetraodon, <1% of the genome is comprised of retrotransposons, so gene retrotransposition
should consequently be less likely [30]. For the eight
genomes studied here, there are no significant linear correlations between the number of genes or proteins from a
genome, versus the number of PRs, or RψGs (data not
shown). Small percentages of the PRs could be classified
as homologs of retrotransposed transposable elements,
such as LINEs (2–12%), or as overlapping pseudogene
annotations (4–13%).

As described in detail in Methods, we applied a 'local gene
order' test, to set aside any PRs that may have arisen
through local or segmental duplication, specifically for
the human and mouse genomes (Table 1). This filter
allows for at most one homologous protein encoded
within a window of +/-3 genes along the genomic DNA
(i.e., Nhomologs ≤ 1) (Table 1). The substantial majority of
human and mouse PRs pass this filter (80–87%).
Ages of primate and rodent gene retrotranspositions
How old are these PRs? Is there any evidence for spurts of
gene retrotransposition activity in mammalian evolution?
To answer these questions, we examined the distribution
of Ks values for PRs compared to their assigned parent
genes, in the human and mouse genomes. (Only PRs passing the local gene order test, with threshold Nhomologs ≤ 1
were analysed.) Ks is the rate of synonymous substitutions
per synonymous site in codons, and has been generally

used to age coding sequences. From comparing Ks values
for PRs, their parents, and orthologs of their parents, we
have also been able to derive lists of genome-specific and
lineage-specific PRs (Figure 4; see Methods for details).
In human PRs, we see that there is a bimodal distribution
of Ks (Figure 3A). The median Ks values for lists of PRs
that are human-specific or that have otherwise been formed
since divergence from dog, are labelled on the Ks histogram. The peak at Ks ~0.06–0.08 corresponds approximately to the median Ks value for PRs formed between
human divergence from dog and from chimpanzee. This
peak has been noted previously in analyses of retropseudogenes and total retrosequence populations [2,3,12],
peaking at approximately the point of human lineage
divergence from the New World Monkeys, some ~40 million years ago [3]. The peak at 0.0–0.02 (containing 21%
of PRs) obviously corresponds to human-specific PRs.
Some of these PRs may simply be too young to differentiate as a PR or retropseudogene (They have not been
around long enough to acquire (apparent) reading-frame
disablements.) Evidence for selection pressures on these
sequences is discussed below.
By comparison, in the rodents, there is more, very recent
gene retrotransposition activity. In mouse, we find proportionately more, genome-specific PRs (relative to rat),

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/308

with 44% having Ks ≤ 0.02 (Figure 3B). In the two
rodents, mouse and rat, there are >200 genome-specific
PRs, compared to ~40 in each of the primates human and
chimp. However, setting aside genome-specific examples,
there are more gene retrotranspositions appearing in the
primate lineage since its divergence from the dog or cow
lineage (Figure 4).
These observations are in keeping with the apparent
maintenance of greater levels of LINE and SINE retrotransposition activity in the rodents [31,32]; also, they tally
well with previous observations for a general fall-off in
such retrotransposition activity in the primate lineage
[2,33].
Transcription evidence
Focussing on human and mouse, we examined the proportion of PRs that could be mapped to a complete Unigene consensus cDNA or a complete Refseq mRNA from
the NCBI ([27]; see Methods for details). For both organisms, we found that the PRs have significantly less mapping of this transcription evidence (P < 0.001, using the zscore for distribution of the sample mean). For human,
only 23% of human PRs mapped to a Refseq mRNA or
Unigene cDNA consensus sequence (compared to 41%
for the whole proteome). This may be due to lower transcription levels, because they are novel gene sequences

Figure 4
Lineage-specific lists of PRs
Lineage-specific lists of PRs: The number of species-specific PRs relative to other species. PRs specific relative to other species were obtained by comparison of Ks between the PR and its parent and the Ks between the parent (KsPR_parent) and the
ortholog of the parent in the other species (Ksparent_ortholog). PRs with KsPR_parent <Ksparent_ortholog were defined as specific PRs relative to the other species. Only PRs which amino acid identity to parents is more than 70% and have an ortholog in other species were subjected to this calculation. Orthology criteria used are 40% identity over 60% length overlap. 'Human-specific' and
'Chimp-specific' PRs are those formed since the species diverged from each other; similarly, for 'Mouse-specific' and 'Rat-specific' PRs. 'Other primate-specific' are any other PRs formed in human or chimp since divergence from dog (in bold typeface),
or from cow (in italic typeface); similarly, for 'Other rodent-specific'.

genomic location of their parent genes [11]. This general
reduction in transcription is also to be expected, if some
of the sequences are recent pseudogenes without disablements.
In addition, we examined how many PRs arise from alternatively-spliced genes. To do this, we cross-referenced the
PR data with alternative splicings classified in the Alternative Splicing Database (ASD) at the EBI [34]. We found
that 24% of genes for human PRs arose from an alternatively spliced gene, compared to 59% of genes overall (significantly less, P < 0.001 using the z-score for distribution
of the sample mean). A significant reduction in representation from alternatively-spliced genes was also observed
in mouse (4%, compared to 29% overall).

of transcribed PRs (purple bars in Figure 5A), compared to
those without transcription evidence (blue bars in Figure
5A). There are relatively very few transcribed PRs with
high sequence identities (i.e., that formed relatively
recently). The bimodal character of these plots may arise
because some of the PRs: (i) are in a younger population
of PRs that are not under selection pressures, but which
have not accumulated deleterious mutations, simply by
chance; i.e., they are pseudogenes without disablements;
or (ii) are in a state of relaxed selection, and thus concomitantly have low transcription levels. Similarly, only a
small fraction of the PRs calculated to have formed since
divergence from the dog lineage (Figure 4), in either
human (15/207, 7%) or mouse (20/292, 7%), are transcribed (significantly less, P < 0.05 using χ2 tests for both
cases).

We examined the divergence of PRs from their putative
parents, in the context of transcription evidence. This is
illustrated in Figure 5 for those PRs that pass the local gene
order test for both mouse and human, with Nhomologs ≤ 1.
In human, there is a marked difference in the behaviour

Ka/Ks and reading frame conservation (RFC) analysis
Is there any evidence for selection pressures on the PRs in
human and mouse? We investigated this question for PRs
that have been formed in human and mouse, since their
divergences from dog. One standard indicator of selection

pressures is the Ka/Ks ratio. This is the number of nonsynonymous mutations per non-synonymous site, over
the number of synonymous mutations per synonymous
site, in codons. Negative (or 'purifying') selection in a specific lineage is indicated by a value significantly <1.0,
where positive ('diversifying') selection is demonstrated
by a value significantly >1.0. We calculated Ka/Ks values
for PRs relative to ancestral sequences for the parents of
the PRs (see Methods for details). We tested whether any of
these Ka/Ks values were significantly < or >1.0 by generating 500 random pairs of sequences as diverged as the PR
and ancestral sequence (to calculate expected means and
standard deviations for the Ka/Ks values), and then deriving a P-value for the observed Ka/Ks.
Strikingly, when we correct for multiple hypothesis testing
in the Ka/Ks calculations, we find only one PR sequence
(formed since divergence from dog) that is under significant selection at the codon level in the human genome,
and none in the mouse genome. (The one significant
human example is a PR under purifying selection, from a
family of proteins with the GTP-binding SAR1 domain.)
In addition, we calculated the distribution of Ka/Ks values
from directly comparing the PRs versus their parents. From
this specific sort of comparison, the neutral expectation
for Ka/Ks is not ~1, because of non-synonymous mutations accumulating in the parent genes [2]. A significant
excess of Ka/Ks values <0.5, however, may be indicative of
purifying selection in the data set. For comparison, we
also similarly calculated a Ka/Ks distribution for RψGs versus their respective parents, carefully parsing out disablements (frameshifts and premature stop codons) from the
RψG sequences. This Ka/Ks distributional analysis is performed for both human and mouse (Figure 6). For human
(Figure 6A), we find no significant excess of PRs with Ka/

Ks values <0.5 relative to RψGs, either for the whole data

contrary to a previous report [12] (χ2 test or Fisher's exact
test). This distribution is thus consistent with a set of

* The most abundant Gene Ontology 'molecular function' terms are listed for each set of sequences, in decreasing order of abundance. The GO
term number and a brief description are followed by the number of occurrences (in brackets). Significant overrepresentation of GO terms was
calculated as described previously using binomial statistics, using a Bonferroni correction for multiple hypothesis testing (P' < 0.05) [37]. 'Structural
constituent of the ribosome' (in italics) is the only term that is significantly overrepresented in all of the three putatively retrotransposed sequences.
** 'Structural constituent of the ribosome' remains the most abundant GO category in this column when PRs from parents with large exons (FLE>0.67)
are removed, or a more stringent Nhomologs threshold of = 0 is used.

largely neutral retrotranspositions, behaving like RψGs.
However, for mouse-specific PRs, there is a significant
excess with Ka/Ks <0.5 (P ≤ 0.001, χ2 test and Fisher's exact
test) (Figure 6B), indicating that some of these mouse PR
sequences are under purifying selection.
Conservation of open reading frames without disablements (frameshifts or stop codons), can also be an indicator of coding ability [12,35,36]. We derived a method for
assessing significant conservation of open reading frames,
using simulation with power-law insertion/deletion
(indel) statistics [4]. Using simulations with calculated
neutral rates of substitution, insertion and deletion, the
likelihood of conservation of an open reading frame without interruption by frameshifts and stop codons, can be
determined (see Methods for details). To give sufficient
power, a P-value threshold of ≤ 0.01 was used as an indicator for significant reading-frame conservation (RFC).
This calculation is complementary to the Ka/Ks analysis.
The results are listed Table 2. Even though there were no
significant Ka/Ks values in mouse, we find over 30 mousespecific PRs that have significant reading frame conservation, and a further 17 that were formed since divergence
from dog (Table 2). In human, we find in total, 59 PRs
with significant RFC, that have arisen since divergence
from dog (Table 2). A phylogenetic tree for an example of
one of the mouse PRs with significant RFC, which is
homologous to citrate synthase, is depicted in Additional
File 3, with a depiction of the chromosomal milieu of this
PR and of its parent in Additional File 4. Two further representative examples of human PRs are also shown in
Additional File 4 (one with significant RFC and the other
without), with varying degrees of age and transcription
evidence.
These results are evidence for conservation of protein
open reading frames, even though we found no evidence
for purifying selection from examination of the sequences
individually for Ka/Ks. This would arise if the PRs were
generally under relaxed or positive selection pressures at
the codon level. The existence of relaxed selection is consistent with the markedly low numbers of PRs found to be
transcribed in both human and mouse, particularly those
that were formed since divergence from dog.
Out of those with significant RFC, is there any evidence
for non-neutral Ka/Ks trends? We checked for significant
excess of PRs with Ka/Ks values <0.5, > 0.5, <1.0 or >1.0
for each of the subsets listed (Table 2). In the human lineage, we find a significant excess of PRs with Ka/Ks >0.5
(40/59, P < 0.05, χ2 test and Fisher exact test, compared to
an expectation from RψG sequences) formed between
divergence from dog and from chimp. This non-neutral
trend is suggestive of positive selection distributed

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/308

throughout this specific subset population of RψG
sequences. Out of the other subsets listed in Table 2, the
only other significant non-neutral Ka/Ks tendency is for
an excess of mouse-specific PRs to be under purifying
selection (26/35 having Ka/Ks <0.5, compared to an
expectation from RψG sequences, P < 0.05, χ2 test and
Fisher exact test).
Functional categories
To assess whether the PRs and RψGs have any unusual
functional associations, we assigned functional categories
using the Gene Ontology (GO) functional classification
(Table 3). As noted previously, 'Structural constituent of
ribosome' is a prevalent functional category for RψGs
[2,3,14]. Noticeably, for mouse, there are more retropseudogenes in metabolic categories, than in human (Table
3). A notable prevalence indicative of origin in retrotransposition, 'structural constituent of ribosome', occurs in the
top ten of all PR (sub)sets, and is ranked number one for
PRs formed since divergence from dog, for both mouse
and human (Table 3). 'Structural constituent of ribosome' is
also the only Gene Ontology term that is statistically overrepresented in all of the retrotransposed gene sets listed
(Table 3 legend; P' <0.05, using binomial statistics and a
Bonferroni correction for multiple hypothesis testing
[37]). The functional category preferences are not caused
by over-representation of any one parent, since when representations of PRs on a parent-by-parent basis are tallied
up, we find only a very small number of parents giving rise
to five or more PRs (Suppl. Table 1); the substantial
majority of parents have only one PR offspring (286/353
[81%] for mouse, and 279/347 [80%] for human).

Conclusion
We have developed two parallel pipelines for the annotation of putative retrogenes (PRs) and retropseudogenes
(RψG) in whole genomes. The new pipeline for retropseudogene annotation employs length-based heuristics to
speed up the processing of sequence alignment data. We
used these pipelines on the vertebrates here, but they are
readily applicable to any genome and its set of gene/protein annotations. Genome analysis is constantly in flux,
and so obviously, as vertebrate genome assemblies and
their annotations are streamlined further, we will be further able to refine our retrotransposition analyses, to
remove any errors from missing gene annotations, small
genome assembly gaps, etc.
We focussed on the annotation of retro(pseudo)genes in
mouse and human. We were particularly interested in the
retro(pseudo)genes formed since divergence from an 'outgroup' genome, that of the dog. We found evidence for
excess, recent gene-retrotransposition activity in both
human and mouse, since their divergences from the dog
lineage. We find some evidence for selection on PRs at dif-

ferent phases of mouse and human genome evolution. In
human, there is statistical evidence for non-neutral evolution (suggestive of positive selection), for population of
PRs that have significantly conserved reading frames and
that formed since divergence from the dog lineage. Also,
we found that, human PRs formed since divergence from
the dog lineage have significantly less transcription evidence, which is consistent with the possibility that they
are pseudogenes, or in some intermediate phase of
relaxed selection. Such a state of low expression coupled
with relaxed selection may also arise for alternativelyspliced exons [38,39]. In summary, our genomic analysis
suggests that some human PRs, formed since divergence
from the dog lineage, are undergoing a form of non-neutral evolution, but the majority are either young pseudogenes (that are undisabled simply by chance), or lowlyexpressed coding sequences in a state of 'relaxed' selection.
