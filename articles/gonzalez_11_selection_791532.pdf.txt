Selection and geographic isolation influence
hummingbird speciation: genetic, acoustic and
morphological divergence in the wedge-tailed
sabrewing (Campylopterus curvipennis)
Clementina González1,2, Juan Francisco Ornelas1*, Carla Gutiérrez-Rodríguez1

Abstract
Background: Mesoamerica is one of the most threatened biodiversity hotspots in the world, yet we are far from
understanding the geologic history and the processes driving population divergence and speciation for most
endemic taxa. In species with highly differentiated populations selective and/or neutral factors can induce rapid
changes to traits involved in mate choice, promoting reproductive isolation between allopatric populations that
can eventually lead to speciation. We present the results of genetic differentiation, and explore drift and selection
effects in promoting acoustic and morphological divergence among populations of Campylopterus curvipennis, a
lekking hummingbird with an extraordinary vocal variability across Mesoamerica.
Results: Analyses of two mitochondrial genes and ten microsatellite loci genotyped for 160 individuals revealed
the presence of three lineages with no contemporary gene flow: C. c. curvipennis, C. c. excellens, and C. c. pampa
disjunctly distributed in the Sierra Madre Oriental, the Tuxtlas region and the Yucatan Peninsula, respectively.
Sequence mtDNA and microsatellite data were congruent with two diversification events: an old vicariance event
at the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (c. 1.4 Ma), and a more recent Pleistocene split, isolating populations in the Tuxtlas
region. Hummingbirds of the excellens group were larger, and those of the pampa group had shorter bills, and
lineages that have been isolated the longest shared fewer syllables and differed in spectral and temporal traits of a
shared syllable. Coalescent simulations showed that fixation of song types has occurred faster than expected under
neutrality but the null hypothesis that morphological divergence resulted from drift was not rejected.
Conclusions: Our phylogeographic analyses uncovered the presence of three Mesoamerican wedge-tailed
sabrewing lineages, which diverged at different time scales. These results highlight the importance of the Isthmus
of Tehuantepec and more recent Pleistocene climatic events in driving isolation and population divergence.
Coalescent analyses of the evolution of phenotypic traits suggest that selection is driving song evolution in
wedge-tailed sabrewings but drift could not be rejected as a possibility for morphological divergence.

Background
Mesoamerica is considered one of the largest and most
important biodiversity hotspots in the world, based
mainly on the global proportion of vertebrate endemism
and the loss of the original primary vegetation cover [1].
Nonetheless, the processes influencing the evolutionary
history and diversification within the region are not well

been a key land bridge for biotic migrations between
North and South America (see for example [2]), and a
significant pulse of avian interchange and further radiation occurred in concert with the Isthmus of Panama

maintaining population divergence, are expected to have
influenced historical patterns of diversification and the
evaluation of such patterns can provide guidance for
the preservation and management of genetic diversity
and endemism in the region [5]. The Mesoamerican

highlands have featured recently in vertebrate mitochondrial DNA phylogeographic studies [6-11]. These studies
observed a point of divergence at the Isthmus of
Tehuantepec, most noticeably in the rodents and birds
that inhabit the mesic highlands. The Isthmus of
Tehuantepec, a geologically complex zone that has
undergone continental uplift and sea level oscillation
since the late Miocene [12,13], has been considered a
major biogeographic barrier [14]. The temporary isolation of populations from either side of the isthmus
owing to oceanic incursions, and the emergence of the
Sierra de los Tuxtlas in the late Pliocene -a volcanic
massif 200-250 km away from the Sierra Madre Oriental- along with changes in local environmental conditions that accompanied late Pleistocene glacial cycles,
may also explain patterns of biotic diversification in this
region.
The wedge-tailed sabrewing (Campylopterus curvipennis), a sexually monochromatic, size dimorphic hummingbird species complex commonly found in montane
cloud forests and humid tropical forests [15], offers an
excellent system for addressing questions about historical biogeography and speciation of Mesoamerican biota.
It is one of the few hummingbird species known for
both the lowlands and montane region with a geographical disjunction at the Isthmus of Tehuantepec [15]:
populations in the foothills of the Atlantic slope of the
Sierra Madre Oriental (from south Tamaulipas to north
Oaxaca) (SMO), and the Tuxtlas region (Sierra de los
Tuxtlas and Sierra de Santa Marta) and a small area on
the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (Jesús Carranza and Uxpanapa) (TUX), are separated from those found from
northeastern Chiapas to central-south of the Yucatan
Peninsula (YUC) (Table 1) [15]. Across their geographic
range, they display subtle variation in plumage coloration and bill and body size, which has lead taxonomists
to name three subspecies: Campylopterus curvipennis
curvipennis (SMO), C. c. excellens (TUX) and C. c. pampa
(YUC) [16]. Wedge-tailed sabrewings are remarkable
among hummingbirds both because they are one of
c. 30 out of 320 extant hummingbird species known as
lek breeders [17], and because of their elaborate singing
displays [18]. In addition, there are marked regional differences in their vocalizations, most noticeably in the
introductory syllable and syllable repertoire [18]. Their
complex syllable structure exhibits geographic variation
that ranges from differences between neighboring males
within a lek to differences between lek members separated by several kilometers [18,19].
Species with highly differentiated populations may
represent the early stages of the speciation process. In
these populations, drift, ecological selection or both
can induce changes in traits involved in mate choice,
promoting reproductive isolation between allopatric

[20-23]. The sole action of drift and mutation can promote phenotypic differentiation or reproductive isolation
[24]. In contrast, ecological speciation can occur when
divergent selection pressures act generally on the

morphological or behavioral characters of species distributed on heterogeneous habitats, where gene flow
among locally adapted populations is reduced [25]. For
acoustic traits, microclimate and vegetation structure
can be important selective pressures on the transmission
of acoustic traits of birds living in different habitats
[26,27]. Another possibility is that within populations,
stochastic changes in traits driven by processes such as
sexual selection promote reproductive isolation between
geographically isolated populations where divergent natural selection is not acting [28,29].
To better understand the patterns of diversification and
endemism in Mesoamerica, we use mitochondrial
(mtDNA) and nuclear (microsatellites) DNA data to
infer the processes behind the evolutionary history of
C. curvipennis. The use of both bi-parentally inherited
molecular markers with different mutation rates is important because it allows us to make inferences at different
temporal scales and provides more reliable insight into the
historical processes involved in the evolution of taxa than
studies based on the analyses of a single marker do. In
addition to genetic data (mtDNA and microsatellites as a
proxy for neutral processes; [30]), we used morphological
and acoustic data along with information about the habitat
(climate and topography) to examine the relative roles of
drift and selection in driving population divergence. The
specific goals of this study were to: (i) examine the patterns of genetic variation and demographic history of
C. curvipennis populations, (ii) infer the processes behind
its evolutionary history, specifically assessing the role of
the Isthmus of Tehuantepec as a barrier, and (iii) evaluate
the role of drift and selection in driving phenotypic (morphology and song) divergence in wedge-tailed sabrewings.
Patterns resulting from intraspecific geographical variation
in phenotypic traits and genetic markers should provide
insights into the factors driving population differentiation
and ultimately speciation in Mesoamerica.

Results
Sequence variation and phylogenetic analyses

From 160 wedge-tailed sabrewings we obtained mtDNA
sequences that contained 81 polymorphic sites (38 in the
ATPase and 43 in the control region) of the 1,407 bp of
the genes analyzed. No insertions or deletions were present; therefore, variants were identified based solely on
nucleotide substitutions. Sixty-three haplotypes were
identified for the 22 wedge-tailed sabrewing populations.
Haplotype and nucleotide diversity are summarized in
Table 2. Haplotype proportion relative to the number of
samples per population was more than 50% in most
cases, indicating high haplotype diversity. No differences
between populations were evident. Nucleotide diversity
was low, indicating little variation between sequences
from the same population.

The consensus tree obtained from Bayesian inference
clustered the haplotypes into two main well-supported
clades (posterior probabilities of 1.0), corresponding to
disjunct western (curvipennis, SMO) and eastern
(pampa, YUC) groups on either side of the Isthmus of
Tehuantepec (Figure 1). Haplotypes of the excellens
group from the Tuxtlas region were clustered in a wellsupported clade nested within the poorly resolved SMO
clade.
Assuming a constant molecular clock and rates of 2
and 5% divergence per My, for the ATPase coding
region BEAST estimated that the SMO and TUX clades
diverged from the YUC clade 1.47 (0.35-3.42) and 0.52
(0.13-1.21) Mya, respectively. These results suggest that
the split between the Sierra Madre Oriental and Yucatan
Peninsula clades may have occurred during the midPleistocene. With respect to SMO, for the TUX clade
the constant clock TMRCA estimated divergence times
of 614,000 (0.12-1.55 Mya) and 202,000 (0.05-0.47 Mya)
years ago for 2 and 5% substitution/My, respectively.
This implies that the split between the TUX and SMO
clades may have occurred more recently in the late
Pleistocene.
Phylogeographic and genetic structure

The haplotype network showed a strong phylogeographic structure among three groups (SMO, TUX,
YUC), but not among populations or areas within the
SMO (nSMO, cSMO, sSMO) (Figure 2). Of the 63 haplotypes obtained, 44 were private to SMO populations.
The most frequent haplotype was shared by samples
from all of the SMO populations, and the rest were low
frequency haplotypes (Figure 2). Seven haplotypes were
private to the Tuxtlas region, and are separated from
the SMO haplotypes by five mutational steps. The
remaining haplotypes (12) were exclusively found in
populations from the Yucatan Peninsula, and formed a
separate network (Figure 2).
The AMOVA results revealed significant genetic differentiation at every hierarchical level. When grouped
by geographic areas (nSMO, cSMO, sSMO, TUX, and
YUC; see Table 1 and field procedures for the definitions) most of the variation (85%) was explained by differences among areas, whereas variation among
populations within areas (0.92%) and variation within
populations (13.94%) only explained a small percentage
of the total variation (Table 3). The same pattern was
observed when grouped by subspecies (curvipennis,
SMO; excellens, TUX; and pampa, YUC) with the highest percentage of the variation being explained by differences among groups (90.41%) and the lowest by
differences among populations within groups (0.55%;
Table 3). FCT values for both analyses were very high
(Table 3) indicating high levels of genetic differentiation

among areas and groups. Pairwise comparisons of FST
among sampling localities ranged from 0.003 for Aqm/
Ama to 0.95 for UG/Gar and were significant in most
cases between sampling localities from the TUX region
and the other localities, and for the YUC region and the
other localities [Additional file 1]. Comparisons between
sites located in the same geographic area (SMO, TUX,
YUC) were not significant [Additional file 1].
Microsatellite markers

Across all sampling localities, the number of alleles per
locus varied from 4 to 20, and within localities across all
loci this number varied from 13 to 62 (mean alleles per
locus, 1.3-6.2) (Table 2). Observed heterozygosity values
did not consistently deviate from H-W equilibrium.
Only four localities were not in H-W equilibrium after
Bonferroni corrections at locus CACU13-2 and one
locality at locus CACU13-7 (Table 2) probably due to
the presence of null alleles. No significant linkage

disequilibrium was detected in any of the populationloci comparisons after Bonferroni corrections.
Significant genetic subdivision was detected among
sampling localities (global RST estimate ± SE, 0.085 ±
0.0021, P < 0.0001), but not among sampling localities
within the fragmented areas of the SMO (global R ST
estimate ± SE, -0.020 ± 0.0021, P > 0.05). Pairwise FST
and RST were quantitatively similar but we only report
RST values because the stepwise mutation model implemented in this estimate is more appropriate for microsatellites [Additional file 1]. Pairwise R ST values among
sampling localities ranged from 0.001 for Xil/Ord to
0.42 for Risc/Nov. As with the pairwise FST values for
the mitochondrial genes, estimates of RST were significant for almost all comparisons between localities from
TUX versus the rest of the localities and comparisons
between localities from YUC versus the rest after Bonferroni corrections. Values from comparisons between
sampling localities within SMO were not statistically

significant. Comparisons between samples from Bec and
Gar (from the YUC region) versus the rest were not significant in most cases after Bonferroni corrections probably due to sample size, affecting statistical power.
The phenogram constructed with pairwise RST, recovered sampling localities from the YUC group clustering
together in a basal position followed by the TUX and the
SMO groups [Additional file 2]. Within the SMO group,
samples from the northern limit of the distribution
(Tamaulipas) are clustered together, as are samples from
San Luis Potosi (central distribution). However, localities
from the southern distribution (Veracruz and Puebla) are
scattered throughout the tree [Additional file 2].
Results of the STRUCTURE analysis corroborated
population substructure. Using all genotypes together
the log likelihood was highest for K = 6; however, when
ΔK is calculated the break in the slope of the distribution of L(K) was at K = 2 (Figure 3). One cluster
includes populations from the Yucatan Peninsula (YUC),
and the other includes samples from populations from
the TUX and SMO groups (Figure 3). However, in the
clustering pattern at K = 3, samples were assigned with
high probabilities to three clusters, corresponding to the

(TUX and SMO); in the analysis where the TUX samples were excluded two clusters were detected for the
SMO samples with no evidence of genetic clustering at
this level. These results suggest a hierarchical clustering
pattern where YUC samples are highly divergent and
samples from TUX are sub-structured in a cluster that
contains samples from SMO.
Among-group comparisons of gene flow (M) from the
MIGRATE analysis ranged from 0.49 (TUX to YUC) to
1.98 (TUX to SMO), however, all comparisons were less
than or not significantly greater than 1.0 (Table 4).
None of the comparisons among genetic groups indicate
contemporary gene flow, suggesting that the Isthmus of
Tehuantepec is preventing gene flow between populations on either side of the isthmus, and that the more
recently divergent populations from the Tuxtlas region

and SMO also have interrupted gene flow. Estimates of
M among populations were only significantly greater
than 1.0 between those within the SMO (M values ranged between 1.4 and 2.3) and the direction of gene flow
was asymmetric in most cases. The direction was mainly
northwards from sSMO to cSMO, and only in few cases
did gene flow reached populations on the northern limit
of the distribution (Ciel, GF). Estimates of gene flow
between populations of different genetic groups were
not significantly greater than 1.0.
Our simulations to test whether genetic groups might
have originated in the face of gene flow were consistent
across replicates, and produced confident posterior
probability peaks for the parameters estimated. When
testing for migration following the split between the
SMO and TUX groups, migration rates were higher
than 1 in the SMO-TUX direction (m = 1.416, 90%
highest posterior density (HPD), 0.004-4.21) and close
to 1 in the opposite direction TUX-SMO (m = 0.91,
90% HPD, 0.007-4.47), suggesting that divergence took
place in the presence of gene flow from the SMO to the
Tuxtlas region. In contrast, low migration rates following the split were estimated for populations east and
west of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (west: m = 0.52,
90% HPD, 0.003-1.27; east: m = 0.36, 90% HPD, 0.0021.23), indicating that the population split occurred in
the absence of gene flow, i.e. this geographic barrier was
not permeable to migrants. Assuming a mutation rate
for microsatellites of 2.96 × 10-3, estimates of effective
population size indicate that the ancestral population
was significantly larger (3,924 individuals, 90% HPD,
2,598-19,005) than the populations after divergence. The
TUX group had the lowest population size (103.88 individuals 90% HPD, 38.01-259.3) followed by YUC (175.67
individuals 90% HPD, 96.28-282.93) and SMO (326.01
individuals 90% HPD, 203.54-474.66).
Morphological and acoustical variation

The MANOVA showed significant lineage differences in
male morphology (Wilks’ Lambda, F6,222 = 33.77, P =
0.0001), and these differences were significant for each
morphological variable (one-way ANOVAs: wing chord

González et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:38
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/38

F2,113 = 16.71, P = 0.0001; tail length F2,113 = 48.45, P =
0.0001; culmen F 2,113 = 57.58, P = 0.0001, SMO n =
106, TUX n = 6, YUC n = 16; Figure 4). The relationship between culmen length and wing chord (as a measure of body size; r = 0.38, P < 0.0001) was further
examined for possible allometric effects using the residuals of this relationship, and the differences between
lineages were maintained (F2,113 = 48.33, P < 0.0001).
For females the MANOVA also showed significant lineage differences (Wilks’ Lambda, F6,42 = 3.89, P < 0.005),
and the results of the univariate ANOVAs were all significant (wing chord F2,23 = 10.17, P < 0.001; tail length
F2,23 = 11.94, P < 0.0005; culmen F2,23 = 4.65, P < 0.05,
SMO n = 21, TUX = 11, YUC n = 5; Figure 4). Overall
these results are congruent with previous subspecific
designation based on bill and body size [31,32], indicating that individuals from the excellens group (TUX) are
significantly larger than those of the curvipennis (SMO)
and pampa (YUC) groups, and that pampa individuals
have shorter bills.
A total of 344 syllable types were detected across populations. Songs were very versatile and no successive syllable repetitions were detected except for vocalizations
recorded in the YUC region from the C. c. pampa

Page 7 of 19

lineage, where individuals commonly repeated one of the
syllables three times in succession (Figure 5). Based on
vocal similarity measures (syllable type sharing), individuals from each sampling locality were clustered accordingly (Figure 5). In addition, the analysis showed
individuals from the YUC lineage group together in a
basal position followed by individuals from the TUX and
SMO lineages (Figure 5). On average populations from
SMO shared a lower proportion of syllable types with the
TUX and YUC lineages (0.062 ± 0.018), than within any
other locality from the SMO (0.145 ± 0.037). Despite the
great syllable diversity observed across populations and
regions, there were some syllables shared by all recorded
individuals, whereas other were shared only by members
from populations from the SMO. Regarding acoustic
measurements of the common syllable, the first three
PCs accounted for 53% of variation (PC1 = 24.4%, PC2 =
18.2%, PC3 = 10.4%). One-way ANOVAs yielded significant group differences in the first PC (PC1, F 2,74 =
107.05, P < 0.0001), but not in the second and third
(PC2, F2,74 = 2.13, P > 0.05; PC3, F2,74 = 1.01, P > 0.05
SMO n = 66, TUX = 6, YUC n = 5). PC1 was mainly
explained by minimum and peak frequency of note 1,
duration of note 3, and frequency range, peak frequency
and duration of note 4.
Comparisons between morphological, acoustic, habitatrelated, and genetic distances

C. curvipennis lineages. Boxplots show the 10th, 25th, 50th
(median), 75th, and 90th percentiles. Values above the 90th and
below the 10th percentile are plotted as open circles. Illustrations
correspond to C. c. curvipennis (A), C. c. excellens (B) and C. c. pampa
(C) taken from the Handbook of the Birds of the World [32].

Mantel tests showed a strong positive correlation
between genetic (pairwise FST) and morphological distances for males (r = 0.42, P < 0.05), even when controlled for geographic distance (r = 0.38, P < 0.05).
However, the relationships between pairwise RST and
morphology were not significant. In the case of females
none of the relationships were significant. Regarding
acoustic distances, Mantel test showed a strong positive
correlation between genetic and song sharing distance
(FST: r = 0.72, P < 0.05; RST: r = 0.71, P < 0.05), and also
for the genetic and common syllable distance (FST: r =
0.72, P < 0.01; RST: r = 0.72, P < 0.01). These relationships were maintained when geographic distance was
accounted for (song sharing: FST, r = 0.50, P = 0.05; RST,
r = 0.51, P < 0.05; common syllable: FST, r = 0.44, P <
0.05, R ST, r = 0.44, P = 0.01). These analyses indicate
that more genetically divergent lineages shared fewer
syllable types, and differed acoustically in the common
syllable, independently of distance. Lastly, we did not
find a significant relationship between morphological
and acoustic distances versus habitat-related (climate
and topography) distances for either males or females.

sizes of sequences corresponding to the three genetic
groups in which morphological characters are fixed
(Tux, Ciel, Nov) were used to differentiate the roles of
selection and genetic drift in morphology evolution. If
morphological characters, assumed to be encoded by
nuclear genes, have sorted significantly faster than
mtDNA haplotypes, then the hypothesis of divergent
selection rather than that of drift is supported. The
observed s value for reconstructed trees was equal to 2
when considering three populations for morphology
characters. The upper 95% CL for time since population
divergence was 3N e generations assuming a dichotomous branching model of divergence and 3.3N e

generations assuming a simultaneous model. When
branch lengths were reduced four times to mimic
nuclear genes, an s value of 2 occurred in one third of
the simulated trees for dichotomous branching, and in
one fifth of the simulated trees for simultaneous branching. There is a high probability (P > 0.05) that nuclear
genes would be fixed in these populations under neutrality, suggesting that drift cannot be rejected as a possibility for morphological divergence [Additional file 3].

roles of selection and genetic drift in song evolution.
The observed s value for reconstructed trees was equal
to 8 when considering four populations for vocal characters. The upper 95% CL for time since population
divergence was 0.48Ne generations assuming a dichotomous branching model of divergence and 0.68Ne generations assuming a simultaneous model. When branch
lengths were reduced four times, an s value of 3
occurred in none of simulated trees, suggesting that
there is a very low probability (P < 0.0001) that nuclear
genes would be fixed in different populations under
neutrality [Additional file 3]. In this case the hypothesis
of divergent selection rather than that of drift is
supported.

Discussion
Phylogeography and evolutionary history

Phylogeographic analyses on mtDNA sequence data and
microsatellites were highly congruent identifying three
wedge-tailed sabrewing lineages: the pampa group in
the Yucatan Peninsula, the curvipennis group along the
Sierra Madre Oriental, and the excellens group in the
Tuxtlas region. The patterns of genetic differentiation
inferred here for C. curvipennis are consistent with the
results for other codistributed avian species in montane
cloud forests of the Sierra Madre Oriental and the Tuxtlas region such as Chlorospingus ophthalmicus [9] and
Buarremon finches [11]. Even though the TUX mtDNA
haplotypes formed a clade nested within the more
diverse haplotype clade of the Sierra Madre Oriental,
these haplotypes are not shared with individuals from
any other population, and are separated by several
mutational steps from the SMO haplotypes. This suggests that not enough time has elapsed for lineages to
sort out the formation of two reciprocally monophyletic
clades [33]. Similarly, the cluster analysis with microsatellites identified the pampa group when K = 2 and
excellens when K = 3, indicating a lesser degree of divergence between the TUX and SMO genotypes in comparison to those of YUC. Consistent with the lack of
haplotype sharing and high pairwise R ST values, the
results of gene flow measures based on microsatellites
indicate that the SMO, TUX and YUC populations
exchange no migrants. Both mtDNA and biparentally
inherited microsatellite loci are spatially structured
between allopatric populations of wedge-tailed sabrewings suggesting that gene flow is restricted and that
C. c. curvipennis, C. c. excellens, and C. c. pampa constitute genetically unique populations.
It is possible that allopatric fragmentation has affected
the genetic structure of wedge-tailed sabrewings.
Although the existence of several mutational steps in a
haplotype network is indeed indicative of allopatric fragmentation, it could also result from non-sampled

Page 9 of 19

haplotypes from intermediate populations. The latter is
not the case here, as we sampled populations covering
the entire geographical range of the species complex
[Additional file 4]. In addition, the possibility that allopatric fragmentation has been a historical process causing the pronounced mtDNA divergence between the
pampa and the curvipennis-excellens groups is consistent with the hypothesis that the Isthmus of Tehuantepec was a major vicariant event and has been a
significant habitat barrier to dispersal, as observed in
previous mtDNA phylogeographical studies with montane bird species [7,9-11]; however, our study is the first
to document the impact of this barrier in a species complex with lowland populations on either side of the isthmus. The isthmus, formed by the superposition of three
distinct tectonic episodes, has been exposed to continental uplift and sea level oscillation since the late Miocene (c. 6 Ma; [12]), periodically encroaching upon or
retreating from the coastal plains, with the peak in sea
level occurring at the end of the Pleistocene [34]. The
phylogeographic breaks in our genetic data suggest a
split between the SMO-TUX and YUC clades in the
mid-Pleistocene (1.4 - 0.56 Ma) toward the end of the
Isthmus of Tehuantepec’s process of formation. Despite
the variability in date estimation using the coalescence
approach, our divergence time estimates point to the
Pleistocene epoch, and these estimates are consistent
with the timing of one of the two pulses of diversification proposed by Barber and Klicka [14] across the isthmus for a community of montane bird species. Our
results from gene flow and isolation with migration
(IMa) support the role of the isthmus as an effective
barrier in which no migration occurred during genetic
divergence.
Regarding the most recent divergence between the
SMO and TUX populations, the oscillations in climate
during the Pleistocene caused a considerable expansion
in the range of highland habitats and their descent to
lower elevations [35,36]. These repeated altitudinal upand downslope migrations of montane forest during glacial periods probably connected the cloud forests of the
SMO with the TUX montane region, and as temperatures increased, the redistributed forested habitat caused
the isolation of the TUX populations. This idea is supported by our results from IMa, which suggests that this
vicariant event occurred in the face of gene flow, from
populations of the SMO to those of the Tuxtlas region,
but not in the opposite direction, indicating that the
connection of the forests allow individuals to disperse
towards the Tuxtlas region. However, estimates of contemporary migration rates indicate that contemporary
gene flow is restricted between these two groups. The
current distribution of coastal plain along the Gulf of
Mexico, which surrounds and isolates the Tuxtlas region

González et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:38
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/38

from the Sierra Madre Oriental, could be a dispersal
barrier between wedge-tailed sabrewing populations.
Because microsatellites have a faster mutation rate than
mitochondrial genes and therefore these markers have
very different temporal scales of inference, our measures
of gene flow based on microsatellite loci indicate that
contemporary gene flow is prevented by both barriers
(the isthmus and the coastal plain). The absence of suitable habitat on the coastal plains along with the presence of pastures and savanna-like habitats in the
isthmus region likely prevents population expansion that
could result in secondary contact between the SMO,
TUX and YUC populations. Hence, gene flow would
require long distance dispersal for wedge-tailed sabrewings to overcome these barriers.
Morphological and acoustical variation: the role of drift
and selection

Morphological data for both males and females indicated that individuals from TUX were significantly larger than those from SMO and YUC, and individuals
from SMO and TUX had longer bills than those from
YUC. The lack of correspondence between climate and
topographic conditions and morphological traits suggests that weak habitat selection pressures have been
shaping morphological divergence. This inference should
be made with caution, considering that habitat structure
was characterized using only ground-based interpolated
climate and topography data. Information about vegetation structure obtained using satellite and airborne
remotely sensed images would offer a more powerful
way for testing adaptive and nonadaptive hypotheses
concerning the evolutionary processes that operate
across the environmentally heterogeneous space occupied by wedge-tailed sabrewings. However, these data
require substantial processing for applications in spatial
analyses and are sensitive to cloud contamination [37];
these data may not be useful for regions with cloud forest and rainforest.
When conducted a coalescent-based test using
mtDNA sequence data to evaluate whether the observed
phenotypic differentiation can be attributed to drift or
some form of selection, we could not reject the possibility of drift in driving morphological differentiation of
the SMO (C. c. curvipennis), TUX (C. c. excellens), and
YUC (C. c. pampa) populations. Besides, independently
of geographic distance, a significant positive relationship
between genetic and morphological distances was found
highlighting the idea that drift might facilitate phenotypic divergence when acting in concert with selection
[38,39]. The increase in body size in small peripheral
populations can be driven by random genetic drift
[38-40]. In addition, the effective population size of
wedge-tailed sabrewings in the TUX region is one-third

Page 10 of 19

and one-half smaller compared to the SMO and YUC
groups, respectively. Another possible explanation for
the increased body size of the TUX individuals is the
relaxed competition for resources that is expected on
islands [40] or in isolated populations such as those in
the TUX region, which are competing for resources
with fewer hummingbird species. If so, this would suggest that individuals from the TUX region have evolved
independently and unconstrained by the evolutionary
events that occurred in the other regions [38].
The increase in culmen length in the SMO and TUX
regions may indicate selection-driven divergence, and
the effect of adaptation to local resources (e.g. flower
size and shape) through natural selection. Differences in
culmen length are congruent with the differences in
habitat characteristics of the Yucatan Peninsula (drier
deciduous tropical forests at a much lower elevation)
compared to the higher altitude and wetter habitats of
the Sierra Madre Oriental and the Tuxtlas region, suggesting that populations adapted to different ecological
conditions, including perhaps the presence of flowers
with longer corollas. Differences in environmental variables provide the potential for ecological differentiation
where different selection pressures might act to shape
the relationship between pollinator and plant species
[41]. However, a comparative study involving traits of
flowers with hummingbird pollination syndrome occurring in each region and the culmen characteristics of
hummingbirds using those resources need to be done.
The divergence of mating-related acoustic signals has
been described as being shaped by habitat-dependent
selection in many bird species [42-47], because sounds
with certain features are better transmitted in some
environments than others. In wedge-tailed sabrewings,
some populations live in different habitats with divergent environmental conditions, most markedly in the
pampa lineage from the Yucatan Peninsula whose individuals live in deciduous tropical forest at a lower altitude and much drier conditions than populations from
the other lineages, which inhabit cloud or tropical forests at higher altitudes that have wetter conditions.
However, we found no significant correlations between
acoustic and habitat-related distances (climate and topographic variables), which suggest that these conditions
play a minor role in shaping song divergence.
In contrast, we found a strong acoustic divergence
pattern in syllable sharing between SMO populations
and also between geographic areas, the latter corresponding to the genetic differentiation among the three
lineages of wedge-tailed sabrewings. Each lineage had an
exclusive assemblage of syllable types, and song sharing
was lower between than within lineages. Also, the
acoustic traits of a common syllable were more divergent between than within lineages. The coalescent

González et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:38
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/38

analysis to evaluate whether vocal differentiation can be
attributed to drift or selection, suggested that the fixation of song types assumed to be encoded by nuclear
genes, has occurred faster than expected by genetic
drift, providing evidence that selection is driving song
evolution in wedge-tailed sabrewings. In lek-breeding
systems where male birds are exposed to strong sexual
selection pressures, the use of certain song types over
others could increase their adaptation to social conditions and/or reproductive success. Although song could
potentially play a role in increasing genetic polymorphisms and generating reproductive isolation and speciation through sexual selection [21,48,49], further
evidence of female preference for local male signals over
foreign ones is needed to fully demonstrate that sexual
selection is causing speciation in wedge-tailed sabrewings (see [50]). An alternative cause of divergence of
songs in wedge-tailed sabrewings is reinforcement selection against maladaptive hybridization, being song a
sexually selected mechanism to maintain reproductive
isolation in case of secondary contact [51]. However, it
is unlikely that the wedge-tailed sabrewings from these
populations come into contact owing to the lack of contemporary gene flow shown in this study, which indicates a historically low potential for hybridization.
The positive relationship between genetic and acoustic
distances suggests that independently of geographic distance, the most genetically distant lineages shared fewer
vocal elements and differed in the acoustic traits of the
common syllable. This relationship is expected under a
drift model of song evolution, where acoustic divergence
is higher between populations that have been genetically
isolated for the longest time [45]. As in songbirds, song
is learned in hummingbirds [52]. Likely song traits are
culturally transmitted through imitation, and learning
errors or innovations (new syllables) across generations
can provide an important source of variation [21,53]
affected by processes similar to those driving genetic
variation, such as drift or selection [54]. In the case of
drift, dialects or song variation at spatial scales could
arise from a process of cultural diversification where
random song mutations are produced by copy errors
[55]. It has also been suggested that song learning may
increase the rate at which genetic predisposition to
learn or prefer certain songs evolves in allopatry [56].
Our data suggest that besides the role of selection in
song divergence, these long time isolated lineages may
have limited acoustic contact, probably resulting in a
low level of repertoire syllable sharing. Despite the long
isolation, individuals of the three lineages share some
syllable types suggesting that their complex songs have
conservative vocal elements retained through generations, and that non-shared syllables were gained or lost
during the isolation and selection process.

Conservation recommendations

The information generated by our study allows us to
make the following conservation recommendation. The
genetic differentiation among the three genetic groups
revealed from the mtDNA analyses suggests that these
groups have been genetically isolated for a long period
of time. This genetic isolation and the lack of contemporary gene flow among these groups were also supported by the microsatellite data. In addition, the
ancestral effective population size was larger than the
size of either genetic group after splitting as revealed by
IMa analysis. Because SMO, YUC and TUX are distinct
genetic groups with no genetic connection among them,
conservation plans should consider the sites within each
of them as independent, and future management plans
should focus on conserving the genetic diversity of the
three genetic groups.
Conservation of the Tuxtlas region is particularly
important due to the restricted distribution of the excellens group, the relatively small effective population size
(one-third of that from SMO), and because the accelerated deforestation rates in the Tuxtlas region [57] is a
threat to the unique genetic diversity of this group and
possibly that of other endemic forms. Although populations within each of the genetic groups showed similar
levels of genetic diversity, erosion of genetic variation is
more likely to occur in the TUX group and thus conservation plans are of particular relevance for this geographic area. The mountains of this region, isolated
from other mountain systems, arose from volcanic activity in the Oligocene, where oceanward orographic uplift
produced one of the wettest climates in Mesoamerica
[58]. This region contains one of the most diverse avifaunas in the northern Neotropics and, due to physical
isolation it has been considered an important region of
endemism [59]. Considering the alarming rate of deforestation in the Neotropics, the preservation of the montane and tropical forest in this region is urgently
needed. To this end, the study of other co-distributed
taxa to cover the phylogeography of Mesoamerica is
warranted. This would shed light on any shared patterns
of colonization and isolation in Mesoamerica and contribute to our understanding of the processes and
responses of organisms to the environmental changes
that drive population differentiation in this region.

Conclusions
The genetic and phylogeographic analyses of this study,
based on mtDNA and microsatellites, uncover the presence of three lineages of Mesoamerican wedge-tailed
sabrewings that exhibit no contemporary gene flow.
These correspond to the disjunct distribution of populations at the Sierra Madre Oriental, the Tuxtlas region,
and the Yucatan Peninsula. Our results highlight the

González et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:38
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/38

importance of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in generating
population divergence c. 1.4 million years ago without
gene flow during the process of divergence, as well as
more recent climate events during the Pleistocene in
driving isolation and population divergence of wedgetailed sabrewings with gene flow from the SMO to the
Tuxtlas populations. Coalescent analyses of the evolution of phenotypic traits suggest that the fixation of
song types has occurred faster than would be expected
by genetic drift, suggesting that the action of selection is
driving song evolution in wedge-tailed sabrewings. However, the role of drift in driving morphological divergence could not be rejected. Finally, considering the
accelerated deforestation rates in the Neotropics the
conservation of the montane and tropical forest in this
region is needed, and special attention must be paid to
small isolated areas with genetic uniqueness such as the
Tuxtlas region.

Methods
Field procedures and feather sampling

For genetic analysis, based on the disjunct geographical
distribution of the species complex [15,32], we sampled
160 individuals from 22 populations during the 2006, 2007
and 2008 Campylopterus curvipennis breeding seasons,
covering the entire geographical range of the species complex: (i) 15 populations of C. curvipennis curvipennis
(SMO), (ii) three populations of C. curvipennis excellens
(TUX), and (iii) four populations of C. curvipennis pampa
(YUC) (Table 1 Figure 2). The populations of the SMO
group were sampled from three disjunct areas along
the Sierra Madre Oriental: (i) three populations from
southern Tamaulipas and northern San Luis Potosí
(nSMO herein); (ii) three populations from southern
San Luis Potosí and Hidalgo (cSMO herein); and (iii)
nine populations from Puebla and central Veracruz
(sSMO herein) (Table 1 Figure 2). Most of the curvipennis SMO populations are located in the understory
of cloud forest or second-growth vegetation at a higher
elevation (270-1,500 m above sea level) where the temperature is lower. The excellens TUX populations are
located in wetter semideciduous tropical forests at a
lower elevation (c. 260-1,000 m above sea level), and
those of the pampa YUC populations are in drier
deciduous tropical forests at a much lower elevation
(c. 60-250 m above sea level) and higher temperatures
(Table 1). Birds were captured in mist nets and the
two outer tail rectrices were collected for subsequent
genetic analysis before released. Research reported
here was performed with the approval of the Mexican
government (INE, SEMARNAT, SGPA/DGVS/02038/
07), the UNAM Graduated Studies Committee (Doctorado en Ciencias Biomédicas), and followed the
Guidelines for the Use of Wild Birds in Research

proposed by the Ornithological Council. We also
obtained tissue samples from three congeners to
be used as outgroups in the phylogenetic analysis
(Campylopterus rufus, C. hemileucurus and C. largipennis) (see Acknowledgments for tissue loans).
Three body measurements were obtained from mistnetted hummingbirds using a dial caliper to an accuracy
of 0.1 mm and a wing ruler: exposed culmen (from the
base of the bill to the tip of the upper mandible), wing
chord (the distance from the carpal joint to the tip of
the longest primary), and tail length (from the base of
the uropygial gland to the tip of the longest rectrix). All
measurements were taken by CG. Sex determination
was carried out in the laboratory by means of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers 2550F [60]
and MSZ1R [61]. González and Ornelas [19] have
further detailed amplification conditions. Because males
were not captured in the Tuxtlas region, we used data
measurements taken by Lowery and Dalquest [62] from
six males at the same collecting sites. To confirm the
feasibility of these data and the possibility of combining
them with ours, we compared the measurements in
males and females from San Luis Potosí taken by these
authors with data taken by us at the same locality. Also
we compared the published measurements taken of
females from those in the Tuxtlas region with our own
data. As we did not detect significant differences
between the two sources of measurements (data not
shown) we used the published measurements of males
from the Tuxtlas region in subsequent analyses.
Acoustic recordings were made for 64 males (557
recordings, ca. 9 recordings per bird) at 11 of the
22 sampled populations (Table 1). Song recordings
were made with a Marantz PMD660 portable solidstate recorder and a Sennheiser MKH-70 directional
microphone.
Mitochondrial DNA sequencing and microsatellite
genotyping

We extracted genomic DNA from one of the feather
samples using chelex (5%, [63]), and that from tissue
samples using the DNA easy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen, Inc.), following the recommended protocol. We
used PCR to amplify two mitochondrial genes. The
ATPase 6 and 8 coding region (875 bp), which includes
two partially overlapping mitochondrial genes, was
amplified using primers L8929 and H9947 [64]. The
first domain of the control region (532 bp) was amplified using primers ARCO1F (5’ AATTTTATGGTGTTT
GTGTGTGAA 3’) and ARCO1R (5’ ACCCTAGCACAACTCGCACT 3’) designed for this study from an
Archilochus colubris D-loop and the complete tRNAPhe gene sequence, and a partial 12 S ribosomal RNA
gene sequence (GenBank accession EF520732.1).

Amplification reactions (25 μl total volume) contained
0.72× buffer, 3.5 mM MgCl2, 0.14 mM of each dNTP,
0.2 μg/μl of BSA, 0.3 μM of each primer, 0.05 U Taq
(Promega), and 2-5 μl of genomic DNA. PCR reactions
were performed in a 2720 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems) or in an Eppendorf Mastercycler thermocycler
with the following temperature profile: initial denaturation at 94°C for 5 min; 35 cycles consisting of denaturation at 94°C for 1.5 min, annealing at 53-60°C for 1 min
and an extension of 1.5 min at 72°C; and a final extension of 72°C for 7 min. PCR products were visualized
on a 1% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide, purified with the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen,
Inc.) and sequenced using the Big Dye cycle terminator
kit. Sequences were visualized in a 310 automated
sequencer (Applied Biosystems) and by Macrogen Inc.
ATPase genes were sequenced in both directions and
the control region only in the reverse direction using
primer ARCO1R except when ambiguities were present
in the sequences. Sequences were edited using
SEQUENCHER 4.8 demo (Gene Codes) and then manually aligned with SE-AL 2.0a11 [65]. All unique
sequences used in this study have been deposited in the
GenBank under accession nos. HQ380686-HQ380755.
Samples were genotyped at 10 polymorphic microsatellite loci designed specifically for Campylopterus curvipennis ([66], GeneBank accession nos. GQ294539GQ294550). PCR conditions and fragment sizing are
fully described in Abdoullaye et al. [66].
Analysis of mtDNA sequence data

We reconstructed intraspecific phylogenetic relationships
among haplotypes using Bayesian inference in MRBAYES
3.12 [67]. Data were partitioned into two matrices, one
corresponding to 875 bp of ATPase 6 and 8 and the
other to 532 bp of control region. MODELTEST 3.7 [68]
was run for each partition to choose the model of molecular evolution that best fit our sequence data. The best
model for ATPase under the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) was HKY + G (base frequencies: A, 0.3588; C,
0.1664; G, 0.2373; T, 0.2376; gamma distribution shape
parameter = 0.1825; transition/tranversion ratio = 6.22),
and for the control region was TrN + I (base frequencies:
A, 0.3688; C, 0.1564; G, 0.2470; T, 0.2278; proportion of
invariable sites = 0.6869). We ran the analysis for 10 million generations using four chains (twice), sampling every
100th generation. We plotted the number of generations
versus likelihood scores to check stationarity. Trees prior
to stationarity were discarded as burn-in (25%), and the
remaining were used to generate a consensus tree, later
visualized in FIGTREE 1.2.3. We used three congeners as
outgroups (C. rufus, C. hemileucurus, and C. largipennis)
to root the tree. Alignment for the phylogenetic analyses
is included as an additional file [Additional file 5].

In the absence of appropriate internal calibration
points for many groups of birds, the 2% divergence-perMy clock calibration has been widely used. However,
the degree of heterogeneity of molecular evolution rates
across lineages and genetic loci could confound the
accuracy of divergence time estimates, making the use
of the 2% rule controversial [69-71]. In a more recent
study, however, Weir and Schluter [72] cross-validated
90 avian clock calibrations (including one for hummingbirds) for cytochrome b obtained from fossil records
and biogeographical events, demonstrating support for
the 2% rule across taxonomic orders. Similar substitution rates have been described for other protein-coding
mitochondrial DNA markers such as ATPase and ND2
[5,73-75]. Nevertheless, in order to minimize potential
biases of this calibration, we calculated divergence times
using two rates for the ATPase coding region data (0.02
and 0.05 substitutions/site/My) as suggested by Tarr
and Fleischer [76], Milá et al. [77], and Barber and
Klicka [14]. Uncertain homology arising from hypervariability or heteroplasmy in non-protein coding mitochondrial control region could confound measures of
molecular clock estimates [77,78], so we did not estimate divergence time for that locus. Time to the most
recent common ancestor (TMRCA) was estimated for
the resulting clades using a Bayesian MCMC sampling
approach with BEAST 1.4.2 [79]. TMRCA estimates
were obtained using a relaxed clock model with lognormally distributed and uncorrelated rates of substitution between branches. No topological constraints were
used allowing topological uncertainty to be taken into
account. The model of evolution determined by MODELTEST under BIC (HKY+G for ATPase), was used for
the analyses, and all other priors were set as default
values in the program BEAUTI 1.4.7 that was used to
create the XML files for input into BEAST. We ran
BEAST for 10 million generations sampled every 1,000
generations, with the first 10 percent of the sampled
points removed as burn-in. We obtained TMRCA estimates employing a range of 2 - 5% My to convert
TMRCA to millions of years ago.
A statistical parsimony haplotype network was
obtained using the program TCS 1.2.1 [80] using the
95% connection probability limit. Some ambiguities
were detected in the networks (loops), and were broken
according to three criteria (frequency, topology and geography), as proposed by Pfenninger and Posada [81].
We assessed the genetic variation within populations
by calculating the haplotype diversity (Hd) and nucleotide diversity (π). To estimate population genetic structure we conducted an analysis of molecular variance
(AMOVA). We used the model of molecular evolution
of Tamura and Nei with a gamma shape parameter =
1.2757 for the combined data set, to estimate genetic

González et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:38
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/38

distances. A total of 16,000 permutations were estimated
to determine the AMOVA’s significance. Two AMOVAs
were run, grouping sampling sites based on the fragmented geographical range of wedge-tailed sabrewings
(Table 1 Figure 2), and grouping sampling sites into
subspecific groups (SMO, TUX, and YUC). Genetic differentiation among populations was determined with F
statistics and pairwise FST. Differences between populations were tested using 10,000 permutations among
populations with Fisher’s exact test. Genetic diversity
estimates, AMOVAs and pairwise FST were performed
in ARLEQUIN 2.0 [82].
Analysis of microsatellite data

Expected and observed heterozygosity and mean number of alleles per locus (allelic diversity) were calculated
in GENEPOP 3.4 [83]. Allelic richness, a measure of the
number of alleles per locus among populations independent of sample size, was calculated with the program
FSTAT 2.9.3. Microsatellite genotypes were tested for
linkage disequilibrium between pairs of loci and for
departures from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE)
within populations and loci in GENEPOP. Bonferroni
corrections were applied to correct for multiple simultaneous comparisons [84].
To investigate population genetic structure we calculated global and pairwise RST [85] and pairwise FST [86]
in RSTCALC 2.2 [87] and ARLEQUIN, respectively.
Differences between populations were tested using
10,000 permutations with a Fisher’s exact test. To
represent the relationships between localities we constructed a neighbor-joining tree using R ST pairwise
values in PAUP 4.0 [88].
To examine geographic patterns of population genetic
substructure, we performed Bayesian genetic clustering
using STRUCTURE 2.2.3 [89], which is used to infer the
most likely number of genetic clusters (K) through the
multilocus genotypic data. We ran STRUCTURE without population information under the admixture model
with correlated allele frequencies. Ten independent
chains were run for each K, from K = 1 to K = 10. The
length of the burn-in was 500,000 and the number of
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) replications after
the burn-in was 1,000,000. To determine an accurate
number of clusters we calculated the statistic ΔK based
on the rate of change in the log probability of data
between successive K values following Evanno et al. [90].
Contemporary gene flow (M) among populations, and
groups of populations, defined by mtDNA and microsatellite analyses, was estimated with a maximum likelihood coalescent approach using microsatellite data and
MIGRATE v. 3 [91]. The first genealogy was started
with a random tree, and initial theta and migration rate
(M) parameters were obtained from F ST calculations.

Page 14 of 19

We ran 10 short (30,000 genealogies sampled) and three
long chains (800,000 genealogies sampled), after discarding the first 20,000 genealogies as a burn-in.
Both mtDNA and microsatellite genetic analyses
indicated three genetically diverged groups. We investigated whether these groups of populations had
diverged in the face of gene flow by using IMa [92].
We performed two different tests, one involving populations from more recently diverged SMO and TUX
populations, and the other involving populations east
and west of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. IMa is based
on a Bayesian coalescent implementation of a model in
which an ancestral population splits into two populations that may exchange genes in both directions at
unequal rates during divergence. We performed preliminary simulations to specify the appropriate priors for
each analysis, and ran three replicates with different
random seed numbers with burn-in periods of
3,000,000 steps and 50,000,000 steps in chain following
burn-in. We obtained estimates of migration rates
between populations (m1, m2), and effective population
sizes (q) from the ancestral population and after the
split occurred between the two groups in both analyses.
Estimates of migration rates were converted to the
effective number of immigrants per generation by
using estimates of theta. For estimates of effective
population sizes of each genetic group we assumed a
mutation rate per generation of 2.96 × 10-3 [93].
Morphological and acoustical variation

To examine differences in morphological variation
between groups of the C. curvipennis complex, we performed a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA)
with the three measurements taken as dependent variables, and lineages (see below) as fixed factors. One-way
ANOVAs followed the MANOVA to determine lineage
differences for each variable. To meet parametric analysis
assumptions, variables were log transformed, but untransformed data are reported in figures. These analyses were
performed for each sex separately due to size dimorphism
using SUPERANOVA (Abacus Concepts, Inc).
We generated spectrograms of recordings using
RAVENPRO V. 1.4 http://www.birds.cornell.edu/raven
with the parameters fully described in González and
Ornelas [19]. We used syllabic units throughout the
wedge-tailed sabrewing repertoire for population comparisons, and syllables were visually classified by structure on printed spectrograms by CG (see [19] for
details). To assess acoustic structure among groups, we
performed hierarchical cluster analyses based on a presence/absence matrix of syllable types for each of 64
individuals, where each entry consists of 0 or 1. We
used the unweighted pair group method of arithmetic
averages (UPGMA) and the Jaccard similarity measure

González et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:38
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/38

to construct a dendrogram. As syllabic composition
between individuals and localities is extremely variable
[18,19], we took measurements from a common syllable
emitted by all individuals from all localities to compare
the temporal and spectral traits of song. The common
syllable was randomly chosen from each individual and
the duration (s), minimum frequency (kHz), bandwidth
(kHz) and peak frequency (kHz) were measured. As this
syllable has several elements (notes), we took the same
measures for two of their elements (numbers 1 and 2,
Figure 6), and the duration of another element (number
3, Figure 6). Principal component analysis (PCA)
reduced the 13 variables taken from this syllable, and
further one-way ANOVAs with uncorrelated factor
scores were used to determine group differences for the
first three PC components. PCAs and cluster analysis
were performed in SPSS v.11.0.2 (SPSS, Inc.), and ANOVAs in STATVIEW (Abacus Concepts, Inc).
Comparisons between morphological, acoustic, habitatrelated, and genetic distances

We used climate and topographic variables across all 22
sampling localities to test for habitat selection acting on
morphology and acoustic traits. We used these variables
as a broad level approximation of habitat and ecological
variation potentially related to availability of floral nectar
resources (see also [41,45]). We extracted 19 climate
variables from WorldClim, a global climate database
with a spatial resolution of c. 1 km2 [94], in combination
with elevation, slope, and the compound topographic
index (CTI; a function of upstream contributing area
and slope that reflects tendency to pool water), all from
the Hydro-1K dataset [95] for each geographic point

Page 15 of 19

where samples were obtained for genetic analysis. The
WorldClim database provides high-resolution climate
matrices that capture climate variability and also
extreme or limiting climate factors.
We followed Ruegg et al. [45] to examine the relationships between morphology, acoustic, habitat-related (climate) and genetic distances. Namely, we performed a
series of simple and partial Mantel tests using IBD [96],
assessing the significance levels of association between
matrices with 1,000 randomizations. Morphological and
habitat-related (climate) distances between populations
were calculated as a dissimilarity matrix with Euclidean
distance scaling to values between 0 and 1. Acoustic distance matrices were built as follows. For song sharing
data (presence/absence syllable types), we estimated the
pairwise Jaccard similarity coefficient between individuals among sampling localities. This coefficient was
calculated in ESTIMATES v. 8.0.0 [97] and values were
subtracted from 1 to change it to a dissimilarity matrix.
For the distance matrix of the common syllable measurements, we first performed a discriminant function
analysis (DFA) using locality as the grouping variable,
and the distance between localities was estimated as the
Euclidean distance between group centroids for the first
discriminant functions, and variables scaled to values
between 0 and 1. Dissimilarity matrices and DFA were
performed in SPSS 11.0.2. To test for the vicariancedrift model, we compared the matrices of morphology
(for males and females separately) and acoustic distances
(syllable sharing and acoustic measurements distance
matrices) versus genetic distances (FST for sequence data
and RST for microsatellites), controlling for geographic
distance with partial Mantel tests. To test for the habitat-selection model, we compared matrices of morphology and acoustic distances (acoustic measurements)
with habitat-related (climate and topography) distances.
The role of drift and selection: a coalescent test

Figure 6 Measurements taken from a common syllable emitted
by every individual recorded.

In order to test whether the degree of male phenotypic
differentiation (vocal and morphological characters) was
caused by drift or divergent selection, we performed an
indirect coalescent-based simulation method developed
by Masta and Maddison [30]. Because sexual selection
by female choice reduces the amount of time needed for
fixation of male phenotypic characters, without reducing
the effective population size of neutral mitochondrial
genes, Masta and Maddison’s method tests statistically
whether the rate of fixation of mitochondrial sequences
differ from those of male phenotypic characters. This
method assumes that nuclear genes code for the phenotypic character of interest (in our case, body size measurements and predisposition to learn certain song
type), and asks whether the degree of fixation of phenotypes observed is likely to occur under the assumption

González et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:38
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/38

of neutrality (see also [50,98]). We performed the HKA
neutrality test for each set of sequences, to determine
whether the genes were appropriate neutral markers.
In order to implement this method with our data, we
performed two different analyses: in the first analysis for
morphological characters we considered three representative populations (a higher number of populations
increases the complexity of simulations; [30]) corresponding to the three genetic groups (Tux, Ciel and
Nov). Because the use of continuous characters in phylogenetic studies can be problematic, we converted the
morphological measurements into discrete characters
states for this analysis. We constructed the character
states of each of the continuous variables (wing chord,
tail length and culmen) using the gap-weighting method
in which the observed variation is divided into a number
of segments of equal size (five character states), giving
large weights to large differences in individual measures
and small weights to small differences [99]. Continuous
characters were coded as follows: wing chord, 0: 62-63
mm, 1: 64-66 mm, 2: 67-68 mm, 3: 69-71 mm, 4: 72-74
mm; tail length, 0: 47-49 mm, 1: 50-53 mm, 2: 54-55
mm, 3: 60-61 mm, 4: 63-64 mm; culmen, 0: 20-22 mm,
1: 23-24 mm, 2: 25-27 mm, 3: 27.5-28 mm, 4: 28.5-30
mm. The character states were fixed for the three populations considered: Nov, intermediate in size with short
bill (wing chord: 0, 1; tail lengh: 0, 1; culmen: 0,1); Ciel,
intermediate in size (wing chord: 0, 1; tail lengh: 1, 2;
culmen: 2, 3); Tux, large in size (wing chord: 2, 3, 4; tail
lengh: 3, 4; culmen: 3, 4). In the second analysis for
vocal variation, we considered four populations in which
vocal characters are fixed (Ciel, Ord, Tux and Nov);
vocal traits were coded as presence/absence of introductory syllable type. In both analyses tests were performed
alternatively by means of two assumptions of population
divergence, dichotomous branching and simultaneous
divergence.
We first calculated the s statistic of Slatkin and Maddison [100], a measure of incomplete lineage sorting
among populations, for maximum parsimony trees
inferred from the analysis of mtDNA sequences (results
not shown); larger s values indicate greater levels of
incomplete lineage sorting, suggesting a more recent
population divergence, and smaller s values indicate
lower levels of incomplete lineage sorting suggesting
older population divergence. Then, we compared the
observed s value against s values obtained from simulated trees to estimate time since population divergence.
This comparison was performed with computer simulations generating 10,000 gene trees within a population
tree by gene coalescence. We set N e = 500 in each
population (as suggested by Masta and Maddison, [30]),
and through simulations the upper 95% confidence limit
was estimated for the number of generations since

Page 16 of 19

population divergence that would be expected to give
the observed s value. Finally, simulations of nuclear gene
trees were run to estimate the probability of complete
fixation of morphological (s = 2) and vocal (s = 3) characters. Estimates of generations since population divergence were divided by four considering that nuclear
genes have four times the population size of mitochondrial genes. Estimates of s, branch lengths and coalescent simulations were performed in MESQUITE v. 2.73
[101].

phenotypic traits. Estimates of s of Slatkin and Maddison from 10,000
coalescent simulated gene trees to test the probability of complete
sorting of vocal characters (A and B) and morphological characters (C
and D) in wedge-tailed sabrewing populations. Regarding vocal
characters, there is a low probability of fixation in nuclear genes under
neutrality regardless of the assumption of dichotomous branching (A) or
the simultaneous model of divergence (B). In contrast, the probabilities
that nuclear genes would be fixed under neutrality are high for
morphological characters, regardless of the assumption of dichotomous
branching (C) or the simultaneous model of divergence (D). This
suggests that divergent selection has caused the pattern of vocal
variation among populations, but the null hypothesis that morphological
divergence resulted from drift was not rejected. Arrows indicate the
expected value of s in a completely sorted tree.
