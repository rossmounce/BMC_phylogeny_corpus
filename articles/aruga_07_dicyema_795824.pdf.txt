Abstract
Background: Dicyemid mesozoans (Phylum Dicyemida) are simple (8–40-cell) cephalopod
endoparasites. They have neither body cavities nor differentiated organs, such as nervous and
gastrointestinal systems. Whether dicyemids are intermediate between Protozoa and Metazoa (as
represented by their "Mesozoa" classification) or degenerate species of more complex metazoans
is controversial. Recent molecular phylogenetic studies suggested that they are simplified
bilaterians belonging to the Lophotrochozoa. We cloned two genes developmentally critical in
bilaterian animals (Pax6 and Zic), together with housekeeping genes (actin, fructose-bisphosphate
aldolase, and ATP synthase beta subunit) from a dicyemid to reveal whether their molecular
phylogeny supported the "simplification" hypothesis, and to clarify evolutionary changes in dicyemid
gene structure and expression profiles.
Results: Genomic/cDNA sequence analysis showed that 1) the Pax6 molecular phylogeny and Zic
intron positions supported the idea of dicyemids as reduced bilaterians; 2) the aa sequences
deduced from the five genes were highly divergent; and 3) Dicyema genes contained very short
introns of uniform length. In situ hybridization analyses revealed that Zic genes were expressed in
hermaphroditic gonads, and Pax6 was expressed weakly throughout the developmental stages of
the 2 types of embryo and in the hermaphroditic gonads.
Conclusion: The accelerated evolutionary rates and very short and uniform intron may represent
a part of Dicyema genomic features. The presence and expression of the two tool-kit genes (Pax6
and Zic) in Dicyema suggests that they can be very versatile genes even required for the highly
reduced bilaterian like Dicyema. Dicyemids may be useful models of evolutionary body plan
simplification.

Background
Dicyemid mesozoans (Phylum Dicyemida) are typically
found in the kidneys of cephalopod mollusks [For general
reviews on Dicyemid, [1]]. They have neither body cavities nor differentiated organs, such as nervous and gastrointestinal systems (Fig. 1A). Their life cycle consists of

two phases (Fig. 1B). One is the vermiform stage, in which
the dicyemid exists as a vermiform embryo formed asexually from an agamete to form worms in the renal sac of the
host. The other is the infusoriform larva, which develops
from a fertilized egg produced around hermaphroditic
gonads called infusorigens and can escape from the host

into seawater. How the infusoriform larvae enter the vermiform stage in the new host is unknown. However, high
population density in the cephalopod phase may cause
the shift from an asexual mode to a sexual mode of reproduction. Notably, both fertilization and embryonic development occur within the worm body. The viviparous
mode of reproduction makes this organism a good subject
for developmental analysis [2].

The original classification of dicyemids as Mesozoa
reflects their intermediate position between the Protozoa
(unicellular eukaryotic organisms) and Metazoa (multicellular animals) in body organization. The phylogeny of
the dicyemids is controversial, and some researchers consider that dicyemids represent truly primitive multicellular organisms. However, several zoologists regard the
simple body plan of dicyemids as the result of specialization of parasitism [references in [1]]. Recent molecular
studies suggest that dicyemids are not truly primitive ani-

mals. 18s rDNA phylogenetic analyses by Katayama et al.
[3] showed that the dicyemids belong among the bilateria, and from the structure of the amino acid (aa)
sequence in the carboxy-terminal flanking region of the
Antennapedia protein in Dicyema orientale, Kobayashi et
al. [4] suggested their affinity to the Lophotrochozoa. A
limited number of genes are available for phylogenetic
analysis, and the phylogenetic relationships of the
dicyemids will need further evaluation when the
sequences of more genes become available.

cDNA and genomic DNA. Both genomic and cDNA fragments containing entire open reading frames were cloned
and sequenced to reveal the entire aa sequences encoded
and the exon-intron boundaries (Fig. 2). Two types of Zic
and actin genes were identified; they were termed ZicA/
ZicB and actin1/actin2, respectively. In the course of the
cloning procedure, we fortunately obtained sequences
representing 2 more genes, the housekeeping genes ATPS
and aldolase, both of which were fully cloned to supplement the analysis (Fig. 2).

If reduction of body plan complexity secondary to parasitism truly happened in dicyemids, we expect to find
genomic features in the dicyemid genome that are associated with the adaptive simplification of body organization. However, such features have not been described in
dicyemids. In broader terms, the genomic basis of the simplification that occurs during the course of evolution is
poorly understood.

We first examined the conserved domains of the putative
aa sequence of Dicyema Pax6 (408 aa), which contained
two conserved domains, the paired box domain (PD,
cd00131.3) and homeodomain (HD, cd00086.3), as do
Pax6 proteins from other animals. Both domains act as
DNA-binding domains. Alignment of the putative aa
sequences of the Dicyema Pax6 PD (Fig. 3A) and HD (Fig.
3B) with those of known metazoan Pax sequences

To determine the genomic changes that may occur during
the simplification of body organization, we focused on
Pax6 and Zic (both of which encode proteins that regulate
developmentally critical processes in diverse bilaterians)
in dicyemids. Pax6 plays key roles in the development of
sensory organs and the nervous system [reviewed in [5]].
In particular, Pax6 is a master gene in eye development in
both vertebrates and Drosophila. In contrast, Zic family
proteins have diverse roles [reviewed in [6,7]]. In vertebrates, they are crucial for embryonic patterning as well as
neural tube formation, neural crest generation, and mesodermal segmentation. In urochordates, Zic proteins are
required for cell fate decisions for differentiation into various cell lineages, including nerve, muscle, and notochord
tissues. In protostomes, Zic genes are essential for embryonic segmentation, midgut morphogenesis, adult head
formation in Drosophila [8-10], and vulva formation in
Caenorhabditis [11]. Both Pax6 and Zic have structurally
related genes in cnidarians; the possible involvement of
these cnidarian genes in developmental processes analogous to those controlled by their triploblast homologs has
been proposed [12,13].

revealed marked similarity among these domains. DNAinteracting aa residues have been determined in human
PAX6 PD by a crystal structure analysis [14]. Conservation
between the human and Dicyema sequences was more
strongly observed in the DNA-contacting aa residues (36/
37) than in non-contacting residues (64/92) (P < 0.001 by
Fisher's exact test), suggesting the functional importance
of the former type of residues. aa sequences other than
those of PD and HD showed no clear similarity to those
encoded by other Pax6 orthologs (data not shown).
Dicyema ZicA (340 aa) and ZicB (340 aa) showed strong
similarity to each other (87% aa matching over the entire
proteins). A homology search analysis with Zic family
proteins in other species revealed that the region of greatest similarity was confined to a zinc finger (ZF) domain
comprising tandem repetitions of 5 C2H2 ZF motifs
(ZF1–5) (Fig. 4 and data not shown); other regions,
including the Zic-Opa-Conserved (ZOC) and ZF-N-terminal flanking-Conserved (ZFNC) domains, lacked noteworthy similarity with other Zic family members [15]. In
the multiple alignment of ZF and ZFNC from various species (Fig. 4), Dicyema ZicA and ZicB showed clear similarity to other Zic proteins in the ZF2–5 region, which is
strongly conserved among all Zic proteins identified so
far. The number of aa residues between the two cysteines
of the ZF1 C2H2 motif was 15. This structure is analogous
to those of other Zic proteins that have highly variable
numbers in this region [ranging from 6 to 38 in15] and is
different from those of Gli/Glis proteins (4 in the corresponding region), which share similar ZF domain
sequences with Zic family proteins.
We identified two Dicyema actin genes that encode actin1
(332 aa) and actin2 (376 aa) proteins (data not shown).
The difference in sequence length reflects the presence or
absence of an N terminal region, and the homology in the
overlapping region was 89% at the aa level.
Exon-intron organization of the Dicyema genes
In total, there were 16 spliceosomal introns in the protein
coding regions of the 7 genes (Fig. 2). The size of the
introns was a surprising feature, as they were generally
short and distributed over a narrow range (mean length,
26.2 ± 1.9 nucleotides, n = 16; Fig. 2). This intron length
may be representative of the major population of intron
sizes in dicyemids.

The positions of introns in the conserved domains of
ZicA, ZicB, and Pax6 were identical to those previously
identified as evolutionarily conserved intron positions in
each gene family [15-18]. The Dicyema ZicA and ZicB
genes both possessed a single intron in the center of the
evolutionarily conserved ZF domain (Figs. 2, 4). The positions of these introns corresponded to that of the A-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/201

intron, which was conserved in all 32 Zic genes from 7 different bilaterian phyla but was not found in the 8 cnidarian Zic genes evaluated [15]. Dicyema Pax6 had 7 introns
(a-g) in the putative protein-coding region (Figs. 2 and 3).
Of the 7 introns, one (a) was located in PD and 2 (c, d)
were in HD. The positions of these 3 introns matched
those of the introns of evolutionarily conserved Pax genes
from a broad range of eumetazoans [17-19].
Phylogenetic analysis utilizing the Dicyema aa sequences
We next tested whether the Dicyema sequences obtained
are useful to understand the phylogenetic position of
Dicyema. All of the deduced aa sequences were subjected
to molecular phylogenetic analyses based on the neighbour-joining (NJ), Bayesian inference (BI), and maximum
parsimony (MP) methods. A support for the bilaterian
origin was obtained in the case of the Pax6 molecular phylogeny.

The metazoan Pax family sequences can be classified into
five groups [20]. For the molecular phylogenetic analysis
of Dicyema Pax6, we first used 129–130 aa PD sequences.
Dicyema Pax6 sequences, previously known Pax6
sequences, and representative Pax sequences from the
other groups. The phylogenetic trees by BI (Fig. 5A) and
NJ [see Additional file 1] methods, commonly grouped
Dicyema Pax6 with other Pax6 sequences. We also performed the analysis using the concatenated PD and HD
sequences (194 aa) from Pax6 family and its closest relatives, cnidarian and placozoan PaxB sequences (Fig. 5B).
Dicyema Pax6 was grouped with Pax6 family commonly in
the BI (Fig. 5B), NJ [see Additional file 1], and MP [see
Additional file 1] trees. Deciphering more detailed phylogenetic position within the bilaterian was not possible in
the current analysis.
To confirm the robustness of the trees, we replaced the
Dicyema branch to other places in the BI tree, and performed the likelihood ratio test developed by Shimodaira
and Hasegawa [21,22]. The results indicated that the
placement of the Dicyema branch to other bilaterian
clades did not significantly worsen the tree except placing
in urochodate clade whereas its relocation to non-Pax6
clades worsen the likelihood scores (Tables 1 and 2).
In comparison to the Pax6, molecular phylogenetic analysis of Zic and the three house keeping proteins did not
provide us any insights concerning the phylogenetic position of Dicyema (Fig. 6) [see Additional file 1]. In the case
of Zic NJ tree (Fig. 6), Dicyema was grouped with diverged
type Zic protein [15]. However, the phylogenetic relationship of diverged type of Zic proteins are highly mixed up
with low statistical support.

Accelerated evolutionary rate in Dicyema species
While conducting the molecular phylogenetic analysis, we
noticed that the Dicyema genes were always placed with
long branches in the phylogenetic trees. To test whether
the evolutionary rate in Dicyema was higher than those of
the other groups of animals, we compared the number of
substituted aa residues with the number of bilaterian
ancestor aa sequences predicted by the ANCESCON program [23]. For this purpose, the available sequences from
major bilaterian phyla were collected from the NCBI databases, excluding paralogs to uniformly represent phylogenetic variances. The comparative analysis included the 7
sequences encoded by the 5 gene groups (Fig. 7). Among
the bilaterian orthologs, the aa sequence of the 3 housekeeping genes (actin, ATPS, and aldolase) from Dicyema
generally showed the highest degree of sequence divergence from the putative bilaterian ancestor sequences
(Fig. 7C,D,E). The differences in the aa substitution frequencies between the Dicyema and the other bilaterian
sequences were statistically significant (actin, P < 1 × 1037; ATPS, P < 1 × 10-7; aldolase, P < 1 × 10-10, by chisquared tests). The divergence rates of the Dicyema actin
sequences were particularly high [5.3 or 3.9 times (actin1
and actin2, respectively) higher than the means of the
other bilaterian sequences], compared with those of ATPS
and aldolase (2.1 and 1.7 times higher, respectively).

The Dicyema Pax6, ZicA, and ZicB aa sequences had divergence rates 3.6, 2.1, and 2.3 times higher than the means
of these sequences in the other bilaterians, supporting the
hypothesis that the sequence divergence rate is increased
among the proteins encoded by Dicyema genes. However,
in the case of Zic and Pax6, the divergence rates varied
among the bilaterian phyla. The variance in divergence
rates over all of the common animal taxa differed strongly
between Zic and the 3 housekeeping proteins [actin, P =
0.0056 (n = 10); ATPS, P = 0.057 (n = 8); aldolase, P =
0.0126 (n = 9) in F-tests].
Expression patterns of ZicA, ZicB, Pax6, and actin
One of our main interests was the role of Pax6 and Zic in
these highly simplified animals. To obtain clues, we
examined the spatial expression profiles of these genes in
Dicyema bodies. Dicyemid ZicA and ZicB were expressed
in the hermaphroditic gonads (infusorigens) within the
axial cells (Fig. 8A,D). No expression was detected in the
embryonic stages (Fig. 8B,C). Pax6 was detected weakly
throughout the developmental stages of the 2 types of
embryo and in the hermaphroditic gonads, frequently
only in the sperm (Fig. 8E). Thus, the hermaphroditic
gonads expressed Pax6, ZicA, and ZicB most clearly (Fig.
9).

In contrast to the highly restricted expression of Zic genes,
actin1 was expressed widely: in the agamete, hermaphroditic gonad, and the 2 types of developing embryo (Fig.
8F,G). actin2 showed an expression pattern very similar to
that of actin1 (data not shown). In the hermaphroditic
gonads (Fig. 8F), actin1 expression was detected in the
sperm and the early-stage primary oocytes. In the developing infusoriform embryos, actin1 transcript was detected
in blastomeres in the vegetal hemisphere of the embryo
from the early to middle stages of development (Fig. 8F).
In the late developmental stages, expression was restricted
to the urn cells that consisted of the internal mass of the
embryo (Fig. 8F). In the vermiform embryos, actin1 was
expressed in the presumptive peripheral cells and agametes within the axial cell of the embryo (Fig. 8G).

Phylogenetic position of dicyemids
Recent phylogenetic analysis of Pax genes revealed five
main classes of Pax genes (Pax4/6, Pax2/5/8/B, PaxA/C/
Pox-neuro, Pax1/9, and Pax3/7/D) [12,20]. In a comprehensive analysis [20], Pax6 and Pax4 homologues are limited to bilaterians and mammalians, respectively, even
though a cnidarian genome project is completing [24].
Based on these backgrounds, we think that the grouping
of the Dicyema Pax homologue with bilaterian Pax6 genes
in this study supports the bilaterian origin of Dicyema.

NJ tree based on metazoan Zic-related aa sequences
NJ tree based on metazoan Zic-related aa sequences. NJ tree of Zic was drawn by MEGA3 [43] by using Zic ZF core
sequences (double underlined region in Fig. 4). The evolutionary distances were determined using the JTT matrix [46]. The
internal labels indicate the percentage value of bootstrap test (1000 replicates). Scale bar represents evolutionary distance in
substitutions/aa residue. Classification of Zic genes according to a previous study [15] is indicated by broken line and arrows.

In addition to the Pax6 phylogeny, the presence of introns
at bilaterian-specific positions in the ZicA and ZicB ZFencoding domains also favors the idea that dicyemids
have bilaterian ancestry. Taken together with the results of
previous molecular phylogenetic studies (18S rDNA [3],
Antennapedia orthologue [4]), we can conclude that
dicyemids are members of the Bilateria, and that dicyemids are simplified bilaterian animals. In fact, the infusoriform larvae of dicyemids have a bilateral body plan (Fig.
1). This feature seems to represent the true level of organization in dicyemids, because these larvae are free-swim-

ming, whereas the adult stages are restricted to the renal
organs of host cephalopods [25]. The bodies of the adult
stages might have been simplified as a reflection of their
specialization to their parasitic habitat – the tubular
spaces of cephalopod renal organs [26].
Although we tried to delineate in more detail the origin of
Dicyema by using other Dicyema sequences, including concatenated ones, the attempt was unsuccessful (data not
shown). The difficulty seems to lie mainly in the highly
diverged nature of the Dicyema sequences. Molecular phy-

Accelerated molecular evolution of dicyemids
The five Dicyema sequences obtained in this study generally showed higher aa sequence diversification rates than
the mean rates of other bilaterian orthologs. In a recent
study, Thomas et al. [27] revealed that marked rate variations exist among the Echinodermata, Arthropoda, Mollusca, Annelida, and Platyhelminthes. They suggested that
the existence of a strict molecular clock cannot be
assumed for the Metazoa. The fact that we found general
acceleration of the divergence rate in Dicyema may support this idea.

abolic rate and shorter generation time may result in more
mutations); and (2) differences in the proportion of
mutations that become fixed in a population (e.g., species
with smaller population sizes are expected to have faster
rates of molecular evolution). In the case of dicyemids,
both remain plausible, because only self-fertilization
occurs in dicyemids [28,29]. However, we can at least
speculate that the presence of an asexual reproductive
cycle may accelerate the accumulation of mutations,
because a recent study showed that transition to asexuality
leads to an excess number of aa substitutions in a microcrustacean, Daphnia pulex [30]. Other possibilities, including shorter generation time and higher metabolic rate,
remain open.

There are two circumstances under which lineage-specific
differences in divergence rates may arise [27]: (1) alteration in the mutation rate of the species (e.g. a higher met-

Short and similarly-sized introns in dicyemids
Another critical finding about the Dicyema genome was
the consistently short length of the introns in dicyemid

There is currently no definitive answer to the biological
significance of the smallness and uniformity of these
intron sizes. However, we noticed that more extreme cases
of intron size reduction appear in the nucleomorph of the
alga Bigelowella natans [34]. The nucleomorph is a vestige
of the eukaryotic cell nucleus after an endosymbiotic
process in which one eukaryotic cell is engulfed by
another. The sizes of the 852 introns in the Bigelowella
natans nucleomorph genome are limited to either 18, 19,
20, or 21 bp. Considering the analogous situation
between endosymbiosis and parasitism, the shortening of
the introns in dicyemids may reflect a high level of selective pressure to reduce unnecessary expense (such as long
introns) during the course of adaptive simplification. The
size reduction may be facilitated by a lack of the need for
the presumptive cis-regulatory elements essential for
adapting to various environments.

genes, especially compared with other eumetazoans. Size
distribution analyses have revealed that the mean lengths
of human, Ciona, and Drosophila introns peak at 87, 60,
and 57 bp, respectively [31]. Dicyema introns were even
smaller than the average introns of fungi (Schizosaccharomyces pombe, 93 bp; Aspergillus, 72 bp) [32]. A recent study
showed that the ciliated protozoan Paramecium tetraurelia
has 20- to 35-bp introns (average size, 24.8 bp; n = 1061)
[33]. This is very close to our mean intron size for Dicyema
(26.2 bp). Although the intron size varies in the eukaryotes, Dicyema may belong to the lowest group.

Gene-to-gene variation of the divergence profile across
metazoan phyla
The actin sequences showed particularly strong diversification between Dicyema and other eumetazoa. This finding
surprised us, because actin genes are widely conserved in
eukaryotes, including in fungi and plants, in which Pax6
or Zic homologs have not yet been identified. Dicyema
actin was expressed in the agamete, hermaphroditic
gonad, and the developmental stages of the 2 types of
embryo. Actin bundles play a role in many cellular processes, such as cell division. This suggests that more transcripts of actin may be required for cell division and
cleavage during embryogenesis than in the external structure of the worms (calotte and peripheral cells). The actin
bundles also contribute to cell movement; actin expression was therefore detected in unflagellated sperm in the
dicyemids. Considering the essential role of actin in determining cell shape in multicellular animals, it is tempting
to speculate that a reduction in somatic cell number, as is
seen in Dicyema, may reduce the evolutionary constraint
on actin protein structure.
Pax6 and Zic genes in the highly simplified metazoa
Our major interest was in the features of Dicyema Pax6 and
Zic, which are utilized in the developmental processes of
many bilaterians. In this context, they can be regarded as
"toolkit genes [35]," like the genes encoding Hox, parahox, and other developmentally critical transcription factors. Our most important finding may be the presence of
both genes in the dicyemid. These genes could have been
lost in the course of evolution. In particular, Pax6 is
widely involved in photosensing organ development in
bilaterians [5]. However, Pax6 PD/HD and Zic ZF were
fairly well conserved, and their diversification rates were
comparable to those of ATPS and aldolase and lower than
that of actin.

Figure 9 patterns of ZicA, ZicB, Pax6, and actin in developmental processes of D. acuticephalum
Expression
Expression patterns of ZicA, ZicB, Pax6, and actin in developmental processes of D. acuticephalum. The development of the hermaphroditic gonad, vermiform embryo, and infusoriform embryo is based on Furuya et al. [50, 51, 52].

Based on their expression profiles, the products of ZicA
and ZicB may have a similar role in the hermaphroditic
gonad within the axial cell. Dicyema Zic genes may therefore be associated with gametogenesis or the differentiation of gametes.
Dicyema Pax6 was detected throughout the developmental
stages of the 2 types of embryo and in the hermaphroditic
gonads. The location of this expression suggests that
Dicyema Pax6 has few specific roles, such as the genetic
control of eye development and neurogenesis. In this
regard, previous studies showed various roles Pax6 in
eumetazoan development. In Caenorhabditis elegans, its
Pax6 homologue (vab-3) is required for the cell fate decision of a male specific blast cell lineage [36], and the control of hermaphrodite gonad size and shape [37]. In
planarians, Pax6A is expressed not only in their nervous
system but also in a non-cephalic parenchyma that gives

rise to ventral marginal adhesive zone and is dispensable
for eye regeneration [38]. Together with our results, the
phylogenetic role of Pax6 may not be limited to the nervous system and photosensing organs.
The maintenance of the two toolkit genes in Dicyema that
lack photosensing organs or nervous systems suggests that
these genes possess unexpected versatility in the development of multicellular animals. The common expression of
Pax6 and Zic in Dicyema hermaphroditic gonads suggests
that they can be involved even in the most fundamental
and indispensable function in multicellular animals, i.e.
gametogenesis.

Conclusion
The results in this study can be summarized as follows: 1)
the Pax6 molecular phylogeny and Zic intron positions
supported the idea of dicyemids as reduced bilaterians; 2)

Page 12 of 16

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:201

the aa sequences deduced from the 7 Dicyema genes were
highly divergent in comparison to those from bilaterians;
3) dicyemid genes contained very short introns of uniform length; and 4) ZicA and ZicB were expressed in hermaphroditic gonads, and Pax6 was expressed weakly
throughout the developmental stages of the 2 types of
embryo and in the hermaphroditic gonads. The accelerated evolutionary rates and very short and uniform intron
may represent a part of Dicyema genomic features. The
presence and expression of the 2 tool-kit genes (Pax6 and
Zic) in Dicyema suggests that they can be very versatile
genes even required for the nervous-system-or-photosensing-organ-lacking bilaterian.

Methods
Animals
Dicyema acuticephalum was obtained from the renal organs
of Octopus vulgaris purchased at a fish market in Osaka,
Japan. The bodies of D. acuticephalum, which are 200–800
μm long, consist of a central cylindrical cell (the axial cell)
and a single layer of 18 ciliated external cells (the peripheral cells; Fig. 1). In the anterior region, 8 peripheral cells
form the calotte, which inserts the anterior region of the
body into the crypts or folds in the renal organs of the host
cephalopod. Species identity was confirmed by 18S rDNA
phylogeny (AB266027, data not shown).
Cloning and sequencing
Dicyemids were collected from the renal organs of the
octopus with pipettes. Contaminating host tissues in the
dicyemid suspension were removed with pipettes under a
stereoscopic microscope. The isolated dicyemids were
washed several times with artificial seawater.

Genomic DNA and total RNA were extracted as described
[39]. For both nucleic acids, glycogen was used during
precipitation to increase recovery. The cDNA fragments
for Pax6, Zic, and actin were amplified by PCR using universal primers [15,40,41]. In a pilot molecular phylogeny
analysis, it was clear that these genes were not orthologs
of any other paired domain-containing genes (e.g. Pax2/
5/8) or ZF motif-containing genes (e.g. Gli and Glis) (data
not shown). On the basis of the sequences initially identified, 3' RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA-ends) PCR
was done with a 3'-Full RACE Core Set (Takara BIO, Shiga,
Japan). In the course of above PCR analyses, we obtained
ATP synthase beta subunit and fructose-bisphosphate aldolase
as PCR products of mispriming. Their nucleotide
sequences were determined and deposited in DDBJ database. We considered that the cloned ZicA, ZicB, Pax6, and
actin1 and actin2 cDNAs represented major molecular species in D. acuticephalum, because all of the PCR fragments
(at least 15 for each gene) generated by universal primers
contained sequences nearly identical to the first fragment
we obtained. The 5' flanking genomic sequences were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/201

cloned with a DNA Walking SpeedUp Kit (Seegene, Seoul,
Korea). Putative exons were identified by the open reading frame search program in DNASISPro (Hitachi Software Engineering, Tokyo, Japan) and by their similarity to
homologs in other bilaterian species. Finally, entire coding regions were amplified from both cDNA and genomic
DNA by using a pair of PCR primers that amplified the
deduced open reading frames of the genes. The PCR products were cloned into pGEMT Easy Vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The nucleotide sequences were determined on
the basis of the sequencing of at least 4 independent
clones. 18S ribosomal DNA was cloned as described [15].
The sources of the cloned sequences were verified by
highly stringent Southern blot analysis using genomic
DNAs from both D. acuticephalum and the cephalopod
Octopus ocellatus (data not shown).
Molecular phylogenetic analysis
Deduced aa sequences were subjected to phylogenetic
analysis. The other sequences were collected from NCBI
database. The lists of the sequences with their species
identity and accession number are indicated in Tables (see
Additional file 2). . Sequences were aligned by using
CLUSTALW [42] implemented in MEGA3 [43]. Regions
with insertions or deletions resulting from the program
were omitted by visual inspection. BI analysis was done
with MrBayes 3.1.2 [44,45]. In BI analysis, we used an
empirical model (JTT matrix, [46]) with Inv+gamma,
alpha shape parameters, and aa frequencies estimated
from the data. We ran 1,000,000 generations with 1 cold
and 3 incrementally heated Markov chains, random starting trees for each chain, and sampling of trees every 100
generations. 50% major-rule consensus trees were constructed from the samples of stabilized trees. NJ and MP
analyses were done with MEGA3.1 [43]. NJ tree was based
on the distance calculation with JTT matrix [46] after
removing position containing gaps (complete deletion
option) for genes other than Zic genes, or after removing
only in pairwise sequence comparisons (Pairwise deletion
option) for Zic genes. For the NJ trees and MP tree analyses, the statistical significance of the branches obtained
was calculated according to a bootstrap test [47] with
1000 repetitions. The alternative tree analysis was done as
described [48]. Briefly, alternative trees were constructed
by RETREE program, and the log-likelihood values were
calculated by PROML program, taking into account sitespecific rate differences using a gamma correction. Both
programs are implemented in PHYLIP program package
[49]. The statistical significance was determined by Shimodaira-Hasegawa test [21,22] implemented in PHYLIP.

For the aa substitution rate analysis, ancestral aa
sequences for each protein were deduced by the ANCESCON program, a distance-based program that gives more
accurate ancestral sequence reconstruction than do PAML,

PHYLIP, and PAUP* at large evolutionary distances
[23]with all of the bilaterian sequences. We used
MEGA3.1 to calculate the pairwise distance. For the test of
heterogeneity of variance (F-test), the aa substitution frequencies were first normalized by [(total aa numbers in
the sequence) × (1-Pinv)].
Whole-mount in-situ hybridization analysis of dicyemids
Parts of the cDNA fragments were ligated into pBluescript
II KS vector, and we used this plasmid to synthesize a Dig
(digoxygenin)-labeled RNA probe. Dig-labeled RNA
probes were made by in vitro transcription from the linearized plasmid with a Dig RNA labeling kit (Roche). T7 or
T3 RNA polymerase (Roche) was used in the in vitro transcription to synthesize an antisense RNA probe for hybridization.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/201

anti-Dig antibody (Roche) was added at 1/2000 volume
of the suspension of dicyemids. The antibody reaction
was conducted overnight at 4°C. The dicyemids were then
washed in PBT for 15 min at room temperature 4 times.
After this, they were washed twice in a detection buffer
(100 mM Tris-HCl [pH 9.5], 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM
MgCl2) for 15 min at room temperature. After these
washes, the dicyemids were immersed in BM purple solution (Roche) to detect the alkaline phosphatase activity.
We also conducted control experiments in the absence of
probe or in the presence of a probe [DDBJ accession no.
AB299857] that gave a spatially restricted signals. The specificity of the signals was checked with these two controls
in each hybridization analysis.

In each step, it took 15 min to form a drop of dicyemids
in the bottom of each microtube. Dicyemids were washed
5 times and then fixed overnight at 4°C in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.5 M NaCl and 0.1 M MOPS buffer. After
fixation, the dicyemids were dehydrated in an ethanol
series (30%, 50%, 70%) for 10 min each and the dicyemids were stored in a 70% ethanol up-series at -30°C.
Dicyemids were hydrated in an ethanol down-series
(70%, 50%, 30%) for 5 min each, and were washed 3
times in PBT (phosphate buffer saline [PBS] with 0.1%
Tween 20). The hydrated dicyemids were partly digested
by protease K (0.5 mg/mL in PBS) for 15 min at 37°C.
After digestion, the dicyemids were washed in PBT and
then fixed in 4% para- formaldehyde in PBS for 60 min at
room temperature. After fixation, the dicyemids were
washed 4 times in PBT for 5 min at room temperature.
After washing, they were incubated in the following serial
steps: in 50% hybridization buffer (5 × SSC, 1% SDS, 50%
formamide) in PBT for 10 min at room temperature; in
hybridization buffer for 10 min at room temperature; and
in hybridization buffer for 1 h at 50°C. After incubation,
the Dig-labeled RNA probe was added to the hybridization buffer and the mixture incubated overnight at 50°C.
The dicyemids were washed in the following serial steps:
in 5 × SSC – 50% formamide – 1% SDS for 20 min at
50°C; in 2 × SSC – 50% formamide – 1% SDS for 20 min
at 50°C; in 2 × SSCT (2 × SSC and 0.1%Tween) for 15 min
at 50°C twice; in 1 × SSCT (1 × SSC and 0.1% Tween) for
15 min at 50°C twice; in 0.5 × SSCT (0.5 × SSC and 0.1%
Tween) for 15 min at 50°C twice; and in 0.2 × SSCT (0.2
× SSC and 0.1% Tween) for 15 min at 50°C twice. After
these washes, the dicyemids were washed for 5 min in a
blocking buffer containing 2% BM blocking reagent
(Roche); they were incubated in the blocking buffer for 60
min and then placed at 4°C for 10 min before the addition of antibody. An alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated
