Abstract
Background: SERPINE2, one of the potent serpins belonging to the plasminogen activator (PA) system, is involved
in the tissue remodeling. We previously demonstrated the expression patterns of Serpine2 in the mouse placenta
and uterus, indicating that Serpine2 is a major PA inhibitor in the placenta and uterus during the estrous cycle,
pregnancy, and lactation. In this study, we further investigated the expression pattern of SERPINE2 in the human
placenta and explored possible functional roles of SERPINE2 in regulating trophoblast activity.
Methods: Placental tissues from various trimesters were collected for real-time reverse-transcription polymerase
chain reaction quantification. Immunohistochemical staining was performed in placental tissues to assure
localization of SERPINE2. SERPINE2 small interfering (si) RNA was applied to suppress its expression in villous
explants and extravillous trophoblast-like 3A cells. Subsequent experiments to evaluate SERPINE2 levels, villous
outgrowth, trophoblast invasion, and tube formation were performed.
Results: SERPINE2 messenger RNA was detected in the human placenta during pregnancy with the highest levels
in the third trimester. The SERPINE2 protein was present in villous syncytiotrophoblasts and trophoblasts of
chorionic villi for anti-SERPINE2 immunostaining. Extravillous trophoblasts in the chorionic plate and basal plate
confronting the invasive face of anchoring villi were also positive. In most decidual cells, SERPINE2 was observed in
the cytoplasm. In addition, fibrinoid deposit was weakly immunoreactive. Introduction of SERPINE2 siRNA into
villous explants and trophoblast cells led to significantly reduced villous outgrowth, and trophoblastic migration
and invasion. Moreover, capillary-like network formation of 3A cells in Matrigel was greatly attenuated by SERPINE2
siRNA and SERPINE2 antiserum.
Conclusions: These data identify the temporal and spatial SERPINE2 distribution in the human placenta and
suggest its possible role in modulating tissue remodeling of extravillous trophoblasts in the placenta during
pregnancy.

Background
SERPINE2, also called protease nexin-1 and glial-derived
neurite promoting factor, is a 44-kDa member of the
serine protease inhibitor (SERPIN) superfamily. It was
shown to be a potent inhibitor of the urokinase-plasminogen activator (uPA), tissue-type PA (tPA), thrombin,
trypsin, factor XIa, and prostasin [1-5].

SERPINE2 is widely expressed in various tissues,
including endothelial cells, fibroblasts, smooth muscle
cells, tumor cells, glial cells, neurons, and placental cells
[6-9]. Expression patterns of SERPINE2 in the placenta
are quite dissimilar in different species. Expression levels
of SERPINE2 in the monkey endometrium and placenta
during early pregnancy were below the level of detection
[10]. In rats, Serpine2 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was only detected in endometrial stromal cells of
the uterus, particularly at the time of implantation [11].

It was reported that SERPINE2 is highly expressed in
the human placenta throughout pregnancy [12].
We demonstrated that Serpine2 is extensively
expressed in various cell types in the mouse placenta
and uterus, and in the human uterine endometrium
[13,14]. In the murine uterus and placenta, it was prominently expressed in decidual stromal cells, metrial
glands, endometrial epithelium, trophoblasts of the
labyrinth, and spongiotrophoblasts during gestation. In
humans, the SERPINE2 protein is highly expressed in
the endometrium during the secretory phase [14]. These
findings suggest a role for SERPINE2 in modulating tissue remodeling during implantation. Although SERPINE2 was found to be expressed by trophoblasts in
various animals, the temporal expression of SERPINE2
in the human placenta during gestation still remains
unclear [12].
Recent reports on human cancers indicated that SERPINE2 levels were elevated in pancreatic tumors [15],
breast tumors [16], colorectal tumors [17], oral squamous carcinomas [18], and liposarcomas [19]. In contrast, the physiological function of SERPINE2 in
placental extravillous trophoblasts that possess “pseudomalignant” features is less well documented [20].
In addition to previous findings of the relatively abundant levels of SERPINE2 in female reproductive tissues,
existing microarray gene expression profiles of normal
human tissues deposited in the NCBI GEO database
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/; GDS596, GDS1096,
and GDS3113) show that the placenta expresses the
highest levels of SERPINE2 among all probed tissues
except seminal vesicles. In the present study, we investigated the spatiotemporal expression of SERPINE2 in the
human placenta. Further, knock-down experiments with
SERPINE2 were performed to examine if the suppression of SERPINE2 in villous explants and trophoblast
cells could modulate trophoblast invasion in vitro.

Methods
Placental tissue collection

Human placental tissues from the first (7~12 wk of
gestation; n = 5), second (13~24 wk of gestation; n = 4),
and third trimesters (31~38 wk of gestation; n = 10)
were obtained from the Department of Obstetrics and
Gynecology, Mackay Memorial Hospital. Signed, written
consent was obtained from each patient before sample
collection. The use of placental tissue specimens and
the consent forms were approved by the Institutional
Review Board of Mackay Memorial Hospital. Tissues
were collected and washed three times in sterile saline,
then they were (a) fixed in 10% neutral formalin (Merck,
Darmstadt, Germany), embedded in paraffin, (b) stored
in either RNAlater (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) at -80°C
for subsequent RNA extraction, and/or (c) finely minced

with a surgical knife and resuspended in culture medium (Medium 199 containing 10% fetal calf serum
(FCS), penicillin/streptomycin, and amphoteracin B).
Cell/explant culture and treatment

3A cells, derived from first-trimester human trophoblast
by SV40 ts30 transformation [21], were purchased from
ATCC (CRL-1584; Rockville, MD, USA). Cells were cultured in medium 199 (M199, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) supplemented with 10% FCS (Invitrogen) and 100
IU/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), and maintained at 37°C in 5% CO 2 . Preparation of placental
explants was performed as described elsewhere [22]. Villous tips were dissected under a microscope to approximately 2~3 mm 3 and incubated for 16 h in culture
medium at 37°C and 5% CO 2. An extracellular matrix
(ECM) gel solution was prepared using 1 ml neutralized
collagen I (4 mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO,
USA) mixed with 1 ml Matrigel (10 mg/ml, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). The ECM gel for explants
was formed by adding 85 μl of the ECM solution onto
the surface of 6-well culture dishes (Nunc, Roskilde,
Denmark). After hardening of the gels, the villous tips
(explants) were put on top of the gel and immersed in
medium for 2~4 h to allow adherence to the ECM.
Explants were then flooded with 1 ml M199 medium in
the absence or presence of small interfering RNA
(siRNA). Three ECM gels in each well containing 9~12
and 30~36 explants of each placenta were utilized. Four
placentas (with respective gestational ages of 9, 12, 16,
and 20 wk) were subjected to explant culture. Villous
outgrowth and migration of trophoblasts were evaluated
following a previously published protocol [23]. Briefly,
the explant morphology was carefully analyzed by two
observers to judge explant outgrowth. The numbers of
outgrowth sites of villous explants were recorded at 72
h. Migration of trophoblast cells in the ECM was scored
at 120 h on a scale of 0-5 (0, no migration; 1, one or
two sites of localized migration; 2, several sites of localized migration; 3, moderate migration; 4, moderate to
extensive migration; and 5, extensive migration from
several sites around the explant).
SERPINE2-targeted siRNAs and corresponding
scrambled siRNAs were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
(for sequences see Additional file 1, Table S1). 3A cells
(3 × 106) were transiently transfected with 0.05 μM of
siRNAs using the Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)
reagent, whereas villous cultures directly gained 1 μM
siRNAs by an active transport mode [24]. After 24 h of
transfection, 3A cells were trypsinized for subsequent
experiments, including RNA extraction following a
reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR), wound-healing assay, invasion assay, and tube formation as described below. During the culture of

Chern et al. Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology 2011, 9:106
http://www.rbej.com/content/9/1/106

explants, the medium was collected at 16 and 24 h for
the Western blot analysis. At the end of the experiment,
explants were harvested and processed for Western blotting, RNA extraction, and RT-PCR.
A batch of explants (at a gestational age of 14 wk) was
cultured for 10 days in Matrigel to allow the ECM gel
shank. The gel containing villi was fixed in 10% neutral
buffered formalin for 24 h and processed for the immunohistochemical analysis.
Immunocytochemistry

Immunocytochemical staining was performed as previously described [14]. Briefly, placental tissues were collected, fixed in neutralized formalin, embedded in
paraffin, and cut into 5-μm sections. After the sections
were deparaffinized and hydrated, they were treated
with 3% hydrogen peroxide in phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS, Invitrogen) for 15 min to quench any endogenous
peroxidase activity, then blocked with 10% normal goat
serum in PBS for 1 h. Immunocytochemistry for the
SERPINE2 and trophoblast-specific CK7 marker was
performed on tissues using anti-SERPINE2 antiserum
(1:700) [14] and anti-human CK7 (1:100) (Dako, Copenhagen, Denmark) in blocking solution at 4°C for 16 h.
Negative controls were performed by replacing primary
antibodies with serum pretreated with SERPINE2-conjugated beads at the same concentration. After washing,
slides were treated with biotin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG; ~3 μg/ml) (Zymed, San
Francisco, CA, USA). Slides were then incubated with
horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated streptavidin
(~1 μg/ml) (Zymed) in the blocking solution for 40 min
at room temperature. Protein signals were detected by
3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (Zymed) staining. Slides were
then counterstained with hematoxylin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) and photographed using a
Zeiss AxioImager Z1 microscope system (Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with a digital camera and an automated
acquisition system (TissueGnostics, Vienna, Austria).
RNA isolation and real-time RT-PCR

Total RNA of placental tissues and 3A cells was
extracted using a QuickPrep RNA extraction kit (GE
Healthcare Life Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden). To examine
SERPINE2 gene expression, an RT-PCR was conducted.
PCR primers (for sequences see Additional file 1, Table
S1) were designed to cross the junction between the
exon and intron. Four micrograms of total RNA was
reverse-transcribed using an iScript complementary
DNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The PCR
was performed in a total volume of 20 μl, and 25 ng of
cDNA was added to the PCR mix made with 2-fold premix containing fluorescein (Kapa SYBR Fast qPCR Kit,

Page 3 of 10

KAPA Biosystems, Woburn, MA, USA). Amplification
conditions were as follows: 95°C for 10 min, and then
40 cycles at 95°C for 15 s and at 60°C for 1 min using
the CFX96 real-time PCR system (BioRad) in triplicate.
The PCR amplification efficiency for each gene was
tested to be sure it was equivalent to that of RPLPO
mRNA examined in a cDNA dilution series. Product
purity was checked through a melting curve analysis at
the end of the real-time PCR. The accuracy of the PCR
products was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Relative
gene expression levels were determined using the
threshold cycle (CT) method (2-ΔΔCt method) with reference to the endogenous RPLPO control [25]. Gene
expression was normalized to RNA loading using primers for RPLPO as an internal standard.
Western blot analysis

Tissue extract proteins were separated by sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSPAGE) on a 4%~15% gradient gel (Invitrogen) and were
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunostaining. Membranes were blocked with 10% (w/v) skim
milk in PBS (blocking solution) for 2 h, and then incubated with anti-SERPINE2 antiserum (1:3000) or monoclonal anti-b-actin (1:5000, Sigma-Aldrich) in blocking
solution for 1 h at room temperature. After gentle agitation in four changes of PBS for 15 min each, the membranes were immunoreacted with HRP-conjugated goat
anti-rabbit IgG (1:10000, GE Healthcare Life Sciences)
or HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:15000; GE
Healthcare Life Sciences) in blocking solution for 1 h.
Immunoreactive bands were revealed using an enhanced
chemiluminescence (ECL) substrate according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA).
Collected medium (25 μl) from explants and 3A cell
cultures were subjected to Blue Sepharose (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) chromatography to remove albumin
and analyzed by Western blotting. Residual albumin was
taken as the loading control and immunodetected by a
rabbit anti-BSA polyclonal antibody (1:2500, GeneTex,
San Antonio, TX, USA).
Invasion assay

Invasion assays were carried out using Matrigel Invasion
Chambers (BD Biosciences). Briefly, cells transfected
with siRNAs (scrambled or SERPINE2) were trypsinized
and seeded on Matrigel inserts in triplicate at a density
of 5 × 104 cells/well in 200 μl of culture medium. Following an incubation period of 48 h, the filter inserts
were removed and washed three times with PBS. Cells
were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Merck) and
stained with hematoxylin for 3 min. Cells on the upper
side of the transwell membrane were removed with a
cotton tip swab. Cell numbers on the filters were

Chern et al. Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology 2011, 9:106
http://www.rbej.com/content/9/1/106

counted under a microscope (IX71, Olympus, Tokyo,
Japan).
Migration scratch assay

3A cells with or without siRNA treatment were harvested after 24 h of transfection, seeded into 10-cm
dishes, and grown to about 95% confluence. A wound
about 1 mm wide was created on cell monolayers by
scraping them with a pipette tip. The dishes were
washed with PBS to remove detached cells and incubated for 16 h at 37°C in the culture medium. After
incubation, images were taken on an inverted light
microscope (Olympus IX71) equipped with a digital
camera. For quantification, these images were analyzed
with the TScratch software tool [26]. This free software
is able to automatically measure the area occupied by
cells in the image. The cell-free area correlated with the
ability of 3A cells to migrate into the scratch, and closure of the controls was used for normalization.
In vitro angiogenesis assay (tube-formation assay)

Matrigel was thawed on ice overnight, and 10 μl was
pipetted with ice-cold pipette tips into the lower chambers of an angiogenesis slide (IBIDI, München, Germany) and allowed to harden for 30 min at 37°C. Then,
7500 cells with or without siRNA treatment were
seeded on the chamber and incubated overnight in the
absence or presence SERPINE2 anti-serum (1:100) in
the medium. Images were taken using an Olympus
DP71 microscope with a camera system and analyzed
using Image-Pro Plus software vers. 6.0 (Media Cybernetics, Houston, TX, USA). Network formation was
quantified by measuring the branch point, and total
cord lengths were compared between silenced and nonsilenced cells.

Immunohistochemistry was used to localize SERPINE2
in placental tissues obtained from the second trimester
(n = 3). SERPINE2 protein expression was visible in
extravillous trophoblast cells and decidual cells of the
chorionic plate (Figure 1B). However, it was strongly
expressed in villous syncytiotrophoblasts, cytotrophoblasts, decidual cells, extravillous trophoblasts anchoring
the villous cell column (av-cc) adjunction zone, spiral
arteries, and decidual stroma cells (Figure 1C, D). The
immunoreaction was evident in extravillous trophoblasts
invading the basal plate, where cytoplasm of most decidual cells were positively stained (Figure 1D). No detectable signal was found in septal endometrial stromal cells
or mesenchymal cores of chorionic villi. Lower immunoreactivity was observed in fibrinoid deposits (Figure
1D). CK-7-positive extravillous trophoblasts were
observed in the cell column (Figure 1E). Syncytiotrophoblasts and cytotrophoblasts in floating villi were strongly
positive for SERPINE2 (Figure 1F, upper-left panel).
Furthermore, most endothelia of spiral artery were both
SERPINE2 and CK-7 positive (Figure 1F, lower panels).
However, when slides were immunostained with control
antiserum, no signal was detected (Figure 1G).
Villous explants

Results

Villous explant culture on Matrigel was demonstrated as
an in vitro model that allows the study of extravillous
trophoblast outgrowth, migration, and invasion during
the first trimester of gestation [22]. We preliminarily
found that more SERPINE2 proteins were secreted into
the culture medium during the outgrowth of explant
villi and the invasion of trophoblasts (Figure 2A). Villi
embodied within the shrunken gel (Figure 2B) at 10 d
were examined with an immunohistochemical analysis.
Trophoblasts with SERPINE2 staining had migrated,
invaded, and formed networks among the gels (Figure
2C-F).
The trophoblast-derived cell line, 3A-sub E (3A)
[21,27], was applied for the in vitro studies of SERPINE2
in extravillous trophoblasts. Of note, 3A cells express
HLA-G, CD9, and CK-7 mRNAs, which are characteristics of invasive extravillous trophoblasts [27,28], as
shown by an RT-PCR study (Additional file 2, Figure
S1). Furthermore, SERPINE2 mRNA levels in 3A cells
resembled those of the first trimester placenta tissue
(data not shown).

Statistical analysis

Data are expressed as the mean ± standard error of the
mean (SEM). Results were subjected to a statistical analysis by Student’s t-tests as appropriate using Prism 5.0c
(GraphPad Prism, San Diego, CA, USA), and significance was accepted when p < 0.05. * p < 0.05; ** p <
0.01; *** p < 0.001. All experiments were repeated three
or more times with similar results.

We analyzed the expression of SERPINE2 in human placentas from various trimesters (n = 5, 4, and 10 for the
first, second, and third trimesters, respectively) at the
mRNA level by real-time RT-PCR. The level of SERPINE2 mRNA was about 2.7-fold higher in the third trimester compared to the first trimester (Figure 1A).

In our examination of the effect of siRNA-mediated
downregulation of SERPINE2 (Figure 3), both mRNA
and protein levels of ex vivo villous cultures and 3A
cells were specifically suppressed. A scoring scale is illustrated (Additional file 3, Figure S2) to show explant
outgrowth and invasion of trophoblasts. The depletion

of SERPINE2 substantially suppressed villous outgrowth
and the invasion of trophoblasts in ECM gels (Figure 4).
Cells deprived of SERPINE2 exhibited reduced migration
and invasion (Figure 5). Wound-healing assays demonstrated that SERPINE2 siRNA reduced the motility of
3A cells on plastic (Figure 5A). Compared to the controls, SERPINE2-silenced cells were significantly less
migratory (52.7% ± 5.9% vs. 34.8% ± 7%, p < 0.01). Likewise, siRNA reduced the invasion of 3A cells through
Matrigel-coated transwells (Figure 5B). The percentage
of cells reaching the undersurface of the membrane had
decreased to 70.4% (p < 0.01) after 48 h. To exclude
that the effects of siRNA on invasion/motility were
caused by a decrease in the proliferative capacity of

cells, accumulative cell numbers were determined (Additional file 4, Figure S3).
Tube-formation assay

Extravillous trophoblast cells were found to develop
endothelial cell-like behavior when cultivated on a
matrix such as Matrigel. They migrated in the matrix to
form networks of tube-like structures [29,30]. Similar
phenomena were obtained from cultures of 3A cells on
Matrigel (Figure 6A, lower panel). mRNA levels of SERPINE2 in 3A cells cultured on Matrigel were promoted
to about 3.1-fold compared to cells cultured on plastic
as control (Figure 6B). Secreted SERPINE2 was analyzed
and found elevated during capillary formation (Figure

6C). We used 3A cells and an angiogenesis slide coated
with Matrigel to investigate the effect of inhibiting SERPINE2 on cell network formation. Compared to the
controls, the number of networks and total length of
capillaries were significantly reduced in the subset treated with SERPINE2 siRNA and in the subset incubated
with SERPINE2 anti-serum (Figure 6A, upper panel).
Immunofluorescent staining was also performed to
assure the localization of SERPINE2 in the formed capillary tubes (Additional file 5, Figure S4).

Discussion
In this study, we demonstrated that SERPINE2 was
extensively expressed in several cell types that exist in
the human placenta. It was highly expressed in syncytiotrophoblasts, cytotrophoblasts, and extravillous trophoblasts in the placenta, while it was relatively weakly
expressed in decidual cells (Figure 1D). These results
were similar to a previous report on the term human

placentas [12] which showed strong SERPINE2 immunofluorescence in amnion, chorion, and trophoblastic
epithelia; lower intense and interspersed signals in
decidual cells and stroma. We further specified the colocalization of SERPINE2 and invaded extravillous trophoblasts at the basal plate and the endothelium of the
spiral artery. Recently, we demonstrated that Serpine2
was extensively expressed in labyrinthine trophoblasts,
spongiotrophoblasts, and decidual cells, but was less
expressed in giant cells in the mouse placenta. The
expression pattern of the placental SERPINE2 protein
greatly differs in various species. In rhesus monkeys,
SERPINE2 protein expression in the compartments of
the endometrium and placenta was lower or undetectable [10]. However, the SERPINE2 protein is extensively
expressed in human and murine placentas.
Interestingly, the pattern of SERPINE2 expression in
the human placenta presented here during gestation
parallels circulating uPA and tPA levels during pregnancy [31,32]. However, SERPINE2 has broad-spectrum
activity specific to serine proteases, including trypsin,
thrombin, factor XIa [4], and prostasin [5]. The question
of what the cognate protease is in the human placenta
needs to be further investigated.

Serine proteases and their cognate inhibitors were
documented to play key roles in matrix remodeling and
degradation in the uterus. Accordingly, a well-regulated
balance between levels of protease and its inhibitor during endometrial matrix remodeling and restricted trophoblast invasion are essential for a successful
pregnancy [33]. We herein showed that downregulation
of SERPINE2 mediated by siRNA effectively suppressed
the outgrowth of villous explants and tended to inhibit
extravillous trophoblast invasion (Figure 4). In trophoblast-derived 3A cells, SERPINE2 siRNA significantly
impaired both migration and invasion (Figure 5). It
seems that the depletion of SERPINE2 disturbs the balance between proteases and protease inhibitors, causes a
shift in the ECM profile, and further affects the activity
of trophoblasts.
During the first trimester of pregnancy, spiral
arteries transform into wide-caliber, low-resistance vessels, extravillous trophoblasts invade through the
maternal decidua to the spiral arteries, and then differentiate into tube structures, lining the artery walls with
endothelial cells. Blockage of SERPINE2 inhibited 3A
cell formation of capillary-like networks in Matrigel
(Figure 6B), suggesting that SEPINE2 is essential for
invading trophoblasts to develop vasculogenic mimicry.
We therefore propose the following scenario for the
regulation of extravillous trophoblasts in tissue remodeling by SERPINE2. SERPINE2 in the ECM establishes a micro-environment that facilitates trophoblast
cell migration, and further promotes trophoblast cells
aligning with themselves or with the maternal endothelium to establish vasculature structures via an
unknown signaling pathway. Additionally, SERPINE2
in the ECM may originate from trophoblasts themselves or from maternal decidual cells in a coordinated
manner.
Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1 or SERPINE1), the phylogenetically closest relative of SERPINE2, is more deeply studied, as exemplified by a
body of published work [34]. Actually, SERPINE1
mRNA seems to be the major PA inhibitor in the
human placenta (our unpublished data). The uPAuPAR system and PAI-1 are undoubtedly associated
with malignances through regulating tumor cell proliferation, migration, invasion, metastasis, and apoptosis
[35-38], although contrary to what would be expected
for the function of a cellular protease inhibitor. Likewise, SERPINE2 is reported to be upregulated in various tumors [15-19]. Further studies of serine
proteases and cognate inhibitors’ effects on placental
tissue development will greatly enhance our understanding of the physiological and pathophysiological
mechanisms of tissue remodeling.

Conclusions
SERPINE2 is highly expressed in the human placenta
during pregnancy. Blockage of SERPINE2 results in inhibition of extravillous trophoblast activity in vitro, including migration, invasion, and tube formation. Taken
together, these data suggest that SERPINE2 plays important roles in modulating placental tissue remodeling
during pregnancy. Our studies may provide helpful
insights into the roles of SERPINE2 in placental
remodeling.
