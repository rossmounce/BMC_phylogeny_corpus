Filoviruses are ancient and integrated into
mammalian genomes

Abstract
Background: Hemorrhagic diseases from Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus (Filoviridae) infections can be dangerous to
humans because of high fatality rates and a lack of effective treatments or vaccine. Although there is evidence that wild
mammals are infected by filoviruses, the biology of host-filovirus systems is notoriously poorly understood. Specifically,
identifying potential reservoir species with the expected long-term coevolutionary history of filovirus infections has
been intractable. Integrated elements of filoviruses could indicate a coevolutionary history with a mammalian
reservoir, but integration of nonretroviral RNA viruses is thought to be nonexistent or rare for mammalian viruses (such
as filoviruses) that lack reverse transcriptase and replication inside the nucleus. Here, we provide direct evidence of
integrated filovirus-like elements in mammalian genomes by sequencing across host-virus gene boundaries and
carrying out phylogenetic analyses. Further we test for an association between candidate reservoir status and the
integration of filoviral elements and assess the previous age estimate for filoviruses of less than 10,000 years.
Results: Phylogenetic and sequencing evidence from gene boundaries was consistent with integration of filoviruses in
mammalian genomes. We detected integrated filovirus-like elements in the genomes of bats, rodents, shrews, tenrecs
and marsupials. Moreover, some filovirus-like elements were transcribed and the detected mammalian elements were
homologous to a fragment of the filovirus genome whose expression is known to interfere with the assembly of
Ebolavirus. The phylogenetic evidence strongly indicated that the direction of transfer was from virus to mammal.
Eutherians other than bats, rodents, and insectivores (i.e., the candidate reservoir taxa for filoviruses) were significantly
underrepresented in the taxa with detected integrated filovirus-like elements. The existence of orthologous filoviruslike elements shared among mammalian genera whose divergence dates have been estimated suggests that
filoviruses are at least tens of millions of years old.
Conclusions: Our findings indicate that filovirus infections have been recorded as paleoviral elements in the genomes
of small mammals despite extranuclear replication and a requirement for cooption of reverse transcriptase. Our results
show that the mammal-filovirus association is ancient and has resulted in candidates for functional gene products
(RNA or protein).
Background
The ongoing threat of emerging hemorrhagic diseases
has made the search for reservoir species with a history of
coevolution with filoviruses a priority [1,2]. Outbreaks of
filovirus infections are known from Africa and the Phillipines [3-5] and, in some cases, the mortality of primates
is so severe as to raise concerns of extinction [5]. Bats are
considered a candidate for a reservoir based on the detection of filovirus-specific RNA, antibodies, and viral parti* Correspondence: djtaylor@buffalo.edu

cles [1,6-10]. Still, the average seroprevalence in tested
bats is much smaller than expected (usually < 5%) for
large colonies of a main reservoir [6], and the ability of
bats to maintain a persistent hypovirulent infection is
unknown. Rodents and insectivores (shrews) have further
been proposed as the leading candidates for filovirus reservoirs by modeling, the detection of filovirus RNA, and
in one specimen, the potential detection of a DNA copy
[2,11]. Rodents (mice and guinea pigs) share one
expected feature of coevolution -- asymptomatic infections from wild-type filoviruses [12]. However, a reservoir role for rodents and shrews has been questioned
because only one study has detected filovirus RNA frag-

ments in these small mammals, and many more outbreaks than observed are expected from a rodent
reservoir that is commensal with humans [7]. Moreover,
no live viruses, filovirus particles or antibodies to filoviruses have been found in rodents or shrews. Distinguishing principal reservoir species from "spillover" infections
remains a challenge.
Filoviruses are a family of non-segmented negative
sense RNA viruses with filamentous virions (Fig. 1). The
protein-coding genes in the filovirus genomes (3'-NP,
VP35, VP40, GP, VP30, VP24, and L protein-5') have a
transcriptional gradient from NP to L protein [13]. The
two major evolutionary groups of filoviruses have been
assigned to the genera Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus.
Filoviruses are estimated to have diverged for less than
10,000 YA [14]--about the same timescale as the rise of
agriculture. Although high mutation rates in RNA viruses
have shrouded nearly every interfamilial relationship, the
Order Mononegavirales, which contains Filoviridae, is an
exception [13]. Here, filoviruses show significant
sequence similarity to some of the Paramyxoviridae such
as Morbillivirus (e.g. measles and Rinderpest viruses)
[15]. Notably, the N-terminal 450 amino acid residues of
NP, which is examined in the present study, shows significant conservation among the Mononegavirales and is
needed for self-assembly of the nucleoprotein [16].
There are now several cases in eukaryotes where nonretroviral integrated RNA viruses (NIRVs) have been
detected [17,18]. Still, this type of transfer is believed to
be extremely rare in mammals [17,19] because the process requires the cooption of reverse transcriptase and
perhaps replication within the nucleus. The sole mammalian example is bornavirus, which is unique among RNA
viruses of animals in developing persistent infections
within the nucleus. The study of NIRVs requires an evolutionary approach where the direction of transfer is
tested. Evolutionary comparisons among NIRVs have
been carried out for the Totiviridae in yeast [20], and the
Bornaviridae in mammals [17]. In the Totivirus system

Results and Discussion
tBLASTn with Marburgvirus NP amino acid sequence
yielded matches with low expect values (as low as 10-49),
indicating that similarity is unlikely to be a chance result.
We found twenty matches with expect values less than
the standard "significance" value of 10-5 (see Fig. 2). The
tammar wallaby, (Macropus eugenii) showed the strongest similarity (49.4% identity) and also had at least 12
different strong sequence matches. The little brown bat
(Myotis lucifugus) had four significant matches, while the
guinea pig (Cavia porcellus), Ord's kangaroo rat (Dipodmys ordii), the common shrew (Sorex araneus), and the
gray short-tailed opossum (Monodelphis domestica;
Chromosome 2) each had single matching sequences
with expect values <10-5. Another marsupial, the common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) had six
strong matches from the Expressed Sequence Tags (EST)
database. All but three of these sequences (including the
EST matches) had at least one apparent disruption of the
open reading frame (ORF). tBLASTn with the L protein
yielded one value with a low expect value (10-74), the gray
short-tailed opossum (Monodelphis domestica; Chromosome 3). A tBLASTn search using the best matching placental mammal match from the original NP search as a
query sequence also yielded strong matches in mammals:
the pygmy hedgehog tenrec (Echinops telfairi), the mouse
(Mus musculus) and the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus).

there strong support for the direction of transfer from
virus to fungus, and a role for the expression of NIRVs in
viral interference has been proposed [20]. We proposed
that NIRVs are more common than presently known and
might be detected in other systems with persistent infections of non-retroviral RNA viruses. As part of a search
for NIRVs in NCBI databases we found strong BLAST
matches of NP sequences from filoviruses to translated
genomic sequences from small mammals. We aimed to
test if these sequence similarities might indicate NIRVs of
filoviruses.

Figure 2 Midpoint rooted maximum likelihood phylogram of nucleoprotein (NP) amino acid sequences from filoviruses, morbilliviruses
and related mammalian genomic and EST sequences. Branches with more than two sequences and strong support (at least 90 for bootstrap or
95 for Bayesian posterior probability) have values shown above the branch (in the order of approximate likelihood ratio tests, Bayesian Posterior Probabilities, and non-parametric bootstrap values). Parentheses contain GenBank Accession numbers and are followed by the range of the sequence for
nucleotide submissions. Red filled branches indicate clades of viruses (Mononegavirales), black filled branches indicate mammalian sequences, and
blue filled lines indicate expressed sequence tags. Geographic origins are given in parentheses adjacent to species names. Shaded cartoons indicate
outlines of species represented in the analysis.

The filovirus-like EST nucleotide sequences from the
common brushtail possum had a BLAST match to a single region of the wallaby genome with longest match
(DY609334) having a 78% identity (9% of mismatches are
gaps) for 662 bases.
We tested for integrated DNA based copies of the filovirus-like sequences in the two mammals with the most
copies, the tammar wallaby and the little brown bat. We
designed PCR primers from mammalian genomic
sequence flanking the longer BLAST matches and carried
out PCR amplification of DNA extractions from different
specimens than used for existing genome projects. Our
sequence of the tammar wallaby had only a single transition difference from the genome project sequence. The
sequence of the little brown bat from Minnesota (FMNH
172384) had a similarity of 96% with four indels compared to contig (AAPE01196249) from the existing
genome. To test for the presence of a filovirus-like DNA
sequence in an additional insectivorous bat, we extracted

DNA from a specimen of big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus). Using primers designed from the little brown bat,
we again obtained PCR product and sequence. In this
case, the identity between the sequences of the two genera of bats was 87% with 11 indels. In each case the similarity of the new sequences obtained from DNA to
genomic sequence is consistent with an integrated filovirus-like DNA copy in these mammalian genomes.
We next carried out a phylogenetic analysis of the NP
and L protein amino acid sequence alignments with
Mononegavirales (paramyxovirids and filovirids) to
assess the direction of the transfer. Because the L protein
gene is known to be the most conserved gene in the
Mononegavirales, a large number of BLAST matches
with expect values <10-5 was found between the families
of Mononegavirales in L protein compared to the NP. The
midpoint rooted maximum likelihood (ML) phylogram
placed the potential mammalian NIRVs within the
Mononegavirales, and revealed that the mammalian

sequences are more closely related to filoviruses than to
Paramyxoviruses (Figs. 2, 3). Indeed the L protein-like
sequence from Monodelphis was more closely related on
the best ML tree to Marburgvirus than to other known
filoviruses (i.e., Ebolavirus) (Fig. 3). This result suggests
that the most recent integration of filoviruses from our
data involves South American marsupials. The NP analysis also revealed that the South American Monodelphis is
more closely related to known filoviruses than to other
mammalian sequences (Fig. 3 and Additional file 1: Fig.
S1). Although many of the sequences are of different
lengths in the NP alignment (Additional file 2: Fig. S2), it
is now well known that sequences of very different
lengths can be accurately placed on phylogenies [21].
However, there could be long-branch effects or alignment
effects for the NP phylogeny as the exclusion of the distantly related Morbillivirus sequences yielded the same
mammalian paraphyly, but increased the support values
(Fig. 4). For both genes, the placement of the mammalian
NIRVs with the filoviruses (i.e. within Mononegavirales)
had maximum support for each measure of reliability.
The placement and the strong support values for this
node are consistent with the direction of transfer from
viruses (Mononegavirales) to mammalian genomes.
Endogenous reverse transcriptase activity has been
shown experimentally to integrate non-retroviral RNA

viruses in mammals [17,22] and may have played a role in
filovirus integration. Interestingly, the closest flanking
coding regions of integrated filovirus-like elements to at
least five of the NIRV's of Macropus, and the separate NP
and L-like NIRVs of Monodelphis, are truncated or disrupted non-LTR retrotransposons of the LINE-1 family.
Our results represent the first case of NIRV formation in
mammals with a virus that has extranuclear replication
[17].
The observation that most of the mammalian
sequences have ORF disruptions and possess only truncated NP-like genes (Fig. 1) is also inconsistent with a
transfer from mammals to virus. Only Monodelphis has
more than one different filovirus-like gene (Additional
file 3: Fig. S3) and these (the NP and L protein-like
sequences) are on separate chromosomes. The apparent
genic bias of NIRVs for the NP gene could have a biological explanation. Because of the transcription gradient in
the Mononegavirales, the most common primary transcript is NP [13]. We also note that experimental expression of an N-terminal portion of the Ebolavirus NP gene
(from residue 1-450 in wildtype NP) that is positionally
homologous to the region of NP spanned by mammalian
NIRVs (from residue 18-405 in wildtype NP, NP_066243)
is sufficient to inhibit the formation of Ebolavirus minigenomes in a dosage specific fashion [23]. A background

transcription bias could account for overrepresentation
in NIRVs of NP, but such a bias fails to explain the N-terminal bias within the NIRVs of NP. The bias is consistent
with the experimental filoviral interference mechanism
involving the N-terminal of NP.
Despite ORF disruptions, it is clear that at least some
mammalian filovirus-like NIRVs of NP are expressed. In
the marsupial Trichosurus, we detected six different NPlike ESTs (EC302609, DY609334, EC300968, EC310159,
DY613238, EC352436) from three tissue-specific cDNA
libraries: liver, spleen/lymphatic system and gonads.
These tissues play an important role in the pathology and
replication of filoviruses [24]. We did not detect the
NIRV in the cDNA libraries made from brain, whole
embryo, kidney, uterus/reproductive tract, or gut tissues.
Still, non-functional pseudogenes can be transcribed by
interactions with neighboring functioning loci [25]. We
tested for selective maintenance of codon structure in the
filovirus-like NIRVs as a further indication of function.
Comparisons of rates of amino-acid changing substitutions (dN or Ka) to rates of silent substitutions (dS or Ks) do

bear the signature of selective codon maintenance or
purifying selection. Non-functional regions should conform to neutral expectations where dN = dS and dN/dS = 1
[26]. For regions undergoing purifying selection, the
silent substitution rate should prevail whereby dN-dS << 0
and dN/dS << 1. The codon-based test of neutrality using
the model of Kumar (which accommodates transition/
transversion rate bias) indicates that silent mutations are
significantly overrepresented in an alignment of filoviruslike NIRVs (dN-dS = -9.427, P < 0.001) [27]. Likewise,
Bayesian calculations of site-specific Ka/Ks using evolutionary models that accommodate codon usage differences [28], reveal a prevailing pattern of values
significantly less than 1 (Fig. 5). Under a model that
allows purifying, neutral and positive selection (Model
M8), the distribution of Ka/Ks peaks at about 0.4. For the
M8 model, 67 percent of these alignment sites (and all of
the M7 sites) have upper 95 percent confidence limits for
<1. While these Ka/Ks values are larger than is typical of
strong purifying selection, they are markedly less than

1.0 that is reported for disrupted transcribed pseudogenes in mammals [29]. Even though there appears to be
selection for preserving codons, the tests cannot differentiate between past and present function. Moreover, the

products need not be protein-based -- RNA interference
products can elicit codon-like selection to interact with
protein-coding genes [29]. The functionality and potential role of NIRVs in the well-known resistance to filoviruses of some NIRV-containing mammals (mice and
guinea pigs) will have to be addressed with experiments.
More than one endogenization is required to account
for the paraphyly of mammals and the paraphyly of marsupials with filoviruses. The finding of a monophyletic
clade for placental mammals with samples from several
continents requires a single ancient integration with several losses of NIRV signal or multiple integrations of a
related virus in unrelated mammal groups (Fig. 6). A single origin for eutherian NIRVs is supported by the rarity
of the process -- endogenization of non-retroviral RNA
viruses with extranuclear replication is previously
unknown in mammals. Ancient transcribed pseudogenes
>100 million years old are known from mammals [29]
and the primate bornavirus integration is believed to be
older than 40 million years [17]. Although much of the
deeper groupings have weak support and there has been
gene duplication, there are some well-supported groupings that agree with mammalian phylogeny. The strongly
supported groups are the two bat genera, the genera of
mouse-like rodents, and the Australian marsupials,
Trichosurus and Macropus. These genera of marsupials
are believed to have shared a common ancestor from 39
to 52 million years ago [30]. A clear indicator of antiquity
is the syntenous genomic location of a rat and mouse filovirus-like NIRV (Fig. 7A, B). These are the same copies
that have a sister group relationship (Fig. 2). It is unlikely
that integration of filovirus NP genes at the same
genomic position occurred independently in rats and
mice. The rat-mouse orthology provides a minimum date
of NIRV formation at 12 to 24 MY [31,32]. Of the species
with filovirus-like elements only the rat, mouse and
Monodelphis have detailed chromosomal maps, but further mapping and taxonomic sampling will permit a more
robust assessment of the age of eutherian NIRVs. Still, we
conclude that the association between filoviruses and
mammals is likely to be 10's of millions of years older
than the previous estimate. Filoviruses join bornaviruses
as the only demonstrated prehistoric non-retroviral RNA
viruses.
The eutherian orders with NIRVs of filoviruses closely
match the proposed candidate reservoir groups of bats,
rodents, and insectivores [1,2] (Fig. 6). This pattern is not
a sampling artifact that we can attribute to the available
genome assemblies. Seven of the ten genomes (including
the Big Brown bat) sampled from predicted reservoir
orders had integrated filoviruses, while only 1 of 27 from
non-candidate eutherian orders had detected integrated
filovirus-like elements (Fisher's exact test, two-tailed p
value = 0.00003). The sole eutherian species from a non-

Figure 6 Summary graph showing mammalian genomes assayed for filovirus-like elements and the phylogenetic distribution of the mammals with filovirus-like elements. Red shading indicates that species with detected filovirus-like elements fall into a marsupial and a eutherian
group. The platypus genome was also assayed but is not depicted here. The mammalian phylogeny is based on a composite of recent studies
[30,44,45].

candidate group to have a potential NIRV was the pygmy
hedgehog tenrec, which is the Afrotherian small insectivore analog on the island of Madagascar. The three
assemblies of genomes from candidate orders that lacked
apparent NIRVs were the ground squirrel (Spermophilus
tridecemlineatus), the European hedgehog (Erinaceus
europaeus) and the fruit bat (Pteropus vampyrus). At
present it is unclear why some small mammal groups
(bats, rodents, insectivores and marsupials) appear to
have an association with filoviruses. Still, the study of
filovirus-like NIRVs could have predictive value for identifying filovirus reservoirs, ancestral proteins, outbreak
modeling, undetected lineages of filoviruses and virulence in mammalian species. For example, the close relationship of South American and expressed Australian
marsupial filovirus-like NIRVs with rapidly evolving African filoviruses now makes it more likely that the New
World harbors undetected filoviruses or has acted as a
source region for extant filoviruses.

Conclusions
Our findings indicate that filovirus infections are
recorded as paleoviral elements in the genomes of small
mammals. These elements are candidates for functional
gene products (RNA or protein). The integration is unex-

pected because filoviruses lack reverse transcriptase and
the ability to replicate within the nucleus. Our results
indicate that the association of mammals with filoviruses
is likely tens of millions of years older than previously
thought.

and 72°C for 2 min, and final extension at 72°C for 5 min.
PCR products were purified and sequenced by the University of Washington High Throughput Genomics Facility. Geneious 4.8 was used to assemble and edit
electrophoregrams. New sequences from this study have
been named as endogenous filovirus-like NP elements
(EFLNP) and assigned the following Genbank accession
numbers: HM545133-HM545135.
Bioinformatics

Initial searches for sequence similarity to filoviruses used
protein sequences from genes of Marburgvirus
(NC_001608.3) as a query with tBLASTn in the WGS
database and the EST database and BLASTp in protein
database of NCBI. A second tBLASTn in the same databases used the best scoring non-viral sequence of placental mammals as a query. A third search used the EST
nucleotide sequences Trichosurus as a query for the
nucleotide and WGS databases. Nonviral subject
sequences with expect values of E < 10-5 and two different
sequences from each of the five known species in the

Filoviridae were retained for alignment. A search constrained to Mononegavirales NCBI Genomic Reference
Sequences Marburgvirus (NC_001608.3) found two species of Morbillivirus had expect values below 10-5
(Rinderpest virus, and Measles virus) that were retained
for alignment. L protein sequences searches used a similar strategy but many more Paramyxoviruses had a significant match to Marburgvirus. We retained 19 different
Paramyxoviruses for alignment with filovirus and the
mammal sequence using BLAST explorer [33].
For genome assembly sequences, the sequence boundaries and translations identified by tBLASTn were used to
retrieve nucleotide sequences and assemble amino acid
sequences. MAFFT [34] was used to align the protein
sequences for all analyses using the default parameters.
The NP alignment was trimmed to the range of the mammalian filovirus-like sequences and the L protein alignment which had a mosaic of conserved and length
variable regions was trimmed by Gblocks [35] (with gaps
allowed).

Phylogenetic estimates were obtained with a maximum
likelihood optimality criterion (PhyML [36] and RAxML
[37]) and Bayesian MCMC methods [38]. Models were
chosen according to the best available optimal model
from Prottest [39] (ML) or using a mixed model prior for
amino acids (Mr.Bayes). Reliability was assessed by nonparametric bootstrapping (ML), approximate likelihood
ratio tests (aLRT: SH like tests), and posterior probabilities. Prottest determined that the LG+G+F model was the
best fit with the AIC criterion for the L protein alignment
and the JTT+G model was the best fit for the NP alignment. We therefore carried out maximum likelihood
analysis using these models. However, as RAxML does
not accommodate the LG model we used the next best fit
model of RtREV+G+F for the RAxML of L protein [40].
For bootstrapping, RAxML estimated the number of
pseudoreplicates. For PhyML, both SPR and NNI search
algorithms were used with five random starting trees. For
Bayesian analysis, a million Markov chain Monte Carlo
generations were initially carried out and convergence
metrics were assessed. If the average standard deviation
of split frequencies <0.01 and a plot of log-likelihood
scores versus generation time as consistent with convergence, then we culled the burn-in set of half of the trees
and calculated the posterior probabilities. We added
500,000 MCMC generations at a time until convergence
metrics were satisfied.
Tests of neutral evolution were carried out using both
approximate methods (Codon-based Z test with Kumar
model [27] that accommodates transition-transversion
ratio bias) and Bayesian methods [28] of estimating sitespecific Ka/Ks. For input, codon alignments were estimated using PAL2NAL [41] from a subset of sequences
from the amino acid sequence alignment. We used only
one sequence per species in the alignment. As both
MEGA and Selecton require continuous ORF's, disrupted
codons were replaced with gaps. For the Bayesian estimate of Ka/Ks, an ML tree was input after estimating with
PhyML and a GTR+G model. Site-specific Ka/Ks values
were culled from the Macropus sequence sites, which
reduced the influence of alignment end gaps on the estimates. A histogram of the Ka/Ks values was created in
PASW statistics 18.
To evaluate orthology between rat and mouse NIRVs,
we used genomic BLAST searches and visualized the
matches and annotations on the NCBI chromosome
maps. Whole chromosome comparisons of larger orthologous blocks were assessed using the Cinteny server [42]
and Roundup database [43].
