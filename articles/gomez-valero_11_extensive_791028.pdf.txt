Abstract
Background: Legionella pneumophila is an intracellular pathogen of environmental protozoa. When humans inhale
contaminated aerosols this bacterium may cause a severe pneumonia called Legionnaires’ disease. Despite the
abundance of dozens of Legionella species in aquatic reservoirs, the vast majority of human disease is caused by a
single serogroup (Sg) of a single species, namely L. pneumophila Sg1. To get further insights into genome
dynamics and evolution of Sg1 strains, we sequenced strains Lorraine and HL 0604 1035 (Sg1) and compared them
to the available sequences of Sg1 strains Paris, Lens, Corby and Philadelphia, resulting in a comprehensive
multigenome analysis.
Results: We show that L. pneumophila Sg1 has a highly conserved and syntenic core genome that comprises the
many eukaryotic like proteins and a conserved repertoire of over 200 Dot/Icm type IV secreted substrates.
However, recombination events and horizontal gene transfer are frequent. In particular the analyses of the
distribution of nucleotide polymorphisms suggests that large chromosomal fragments of over 200 kbs are
exchanged between L. pneumophila strains and contribute to the genome dynamics in the natural population. The
many secretion systems present might be implicated in exchange of these fragments by conjugal transfer.
Plasmids also play a role in genome diversification and are exchanged among strains and circulate between
different Legionella species.
Conclusion: Horizontal gene transfer among bacteria and from eukaryotes to L. pneumophila as well as
recombination between strains allows different clones to evolve into predominant disease clones and others to
replace them subsequently within relatively short periods of time.

Background
Legionella pneumophila is the etiologic agent of Legionnaires’ disease, an atypical pneumonia, which is often
fatal if not treated promptly. However, it is principally
an environmental bacterium that inhabits fresh water
reservoirs worldwide where it parasitizes within free-living protozoa but also survives in biofilms [1-3]. Since L.
pneumophila does not spread from person-to-person,
humans have been inconsequential for the evolution of
this pathogen. Instead, the virulence strategies of L.
pneumophila have been shaped by selective pressures in

aquatic ecosystems. Indeed, the co-evolution of L. pneumophila with fresh-water amoebae is reflected in its
genome sequence. The analysis of two L. pneumophila
genomes identified the presence of an unexpected high
number and variety of eukaryotic-like proteins and proteins containing motifs mainly found in eukaryotes [4].
These proteins were predicted to interfere in different
steps of the infectious cycle by mimicking functions of
eukaryotic proteins [4]. For several of these eukaryotic
like proteins it has been shown recently that they are
secreted effectors that help L. pneumophila to subvert
host functions to allow intracellular replication [5,6].
The possibility that L. pneumophila has acquired at least
some of these genes through horizontal gene transfer
from eukaryotes has been suggested by two studies [7,8].

Plasticity is another specific feature of the L. pneumophila genomes as integrative plasmids, putative conjugation elements and genomic islands were identified. In
addition to DNA interchange between different bacterial
genera and even domains of life, horizontal gene transfer within the genus Legionella and within the species L.
pneumophila has been reported. For example a 65-kb
pathogenicity island described first in L. pneumophila
strain Philadelphia [9] is present in several L. pneumophila strains and also in other Legionella species like L.
anisa [10]. Another example is the particular lipopolysaccharide cluster of serogroup 1 strains that has been
detected in L. pneumophila strains of different lineages
and genetic backgrounds [10]. L. pneumophila has all
necessary features for incorporating foreign DNA, as
these bacteria are naturally competent and possess an
intact recombination machinery [11,12]. These findings
suggest that the L. pneumophila genomes are very
dynamic and one would expect that horizontal gene
transfer and recombination events play an important
role in their evolution.
However, different analyses like early studies applying
multilocus enzyme electrophoreses (MEE) supported a
clonal population structure of L. pneumophila [13]. Two
recent reports using genetic profiling based on six or
three genetic loci, respectively concluded also that L.
pneumophila shows a clonal populations structure
[14,15] although the presence of few recombination
events was not ruled out. Later the analysis of the dotA,
mip and rpoB genes in different isolates suggested for
the first time that recombination may play some role in
L. pneumophila evolution [16-18] and a more in depth
analysis using over 20 loci suggested that recombination
events might be more frequent than was previously
thought [19]. However, comparisons of these studies are
difficult due to different sampling and different analysis
methods used. Furthermore there may be a bias associated with some of the genes selected in these studies
like intergenic spacer regions or genes under positive
selection that may lead to artefactual effects in detecting
recombination. To solve these problem efforts have
been undertaken recently to homogenize the results
obtained for different species to allow comparisons [20].
These authors report for L. pneumophila a low recombination rate like for the obligate pathogens Bordetella
pertussis or Bartonella henselae. In contrast Coscolla
and colleagues suggest a more important role for
recombination at the intergenic level [21].
These different results and the fact that a globally distributed L. pneumophila clone implicated in Legionnaires’ disease has been described [10] may suggest that
the role of recombination is not relevant. However, the
description of clonal complexes is not incompatible with
high recombination rates. Transient clones may appear

Page 2 of 24

within a recombining population [22], in particular if
clones with high disease prevalence appear, as this
seems to be the case for some L. pneumophila strains.
These clones are often vastly over-sampled due to their
clinical importance and show strong clonality. Thus, this
may be correct for this subgroup, but it may not be
representative for the population. Indeed when analyzing
over 200 clinical and environmental L. pneumophila
strains, significantly less diversity was found among the
clinical isolates [23].
In this study we investigated the genome dynamics
and evolution of the species L. pneumophila by analyzing horizontal gene transfer, mobile genetic elements
and recombination on a genome-wide level. We undertook this analysis based on six complete genome
sequences four of which are the previously published
reference genomes of L. pneumophila Paris, Lens [4],
Corby [24] and Philadelphia [25] and two that were
sequenced in this study. The newly sequenced strains
were selected according to epidemiological features that
might be reflected in their genomes and should thus
allow to study genome dynamics with respect to virulence. Strain Lorraine is rarely isolated from the environment but its prevalence in human disease is
increasing considerably in the last years [26]. In contrast, L. pneumophila strain HL 0604 1035 has been frequently isolated from a hospital water system since over
10 years but has never caused disease. Analysis of these
six strains identified a highly conserved and syntenic
core genome and a diverse accessory genome. Furthermore, it showed that recombination events and horizontal gene transfer are frequent in L. pneumophila.
Horizontal gene transfer from eukaryotes as well as
recombination between strains were identified suggesting that L. pneumophila genomes are highly dynamic, a
feature allowing different clones to evolve into predominant disease clones and others to replace them subsequently within relatively short periods of time.

Results and discussion
The L. pneumophila core genome comprises over 2400
conserved genes that are highly syntenic

To get comprehensive insight into the genetic basis,
evolution and genome dynamics of L. pneumophila Sg1,
the strains responsible for over 90% of disease worldwide, we analyzed six completely sequenced genomes.
The strains selected are all of Sg1, have endemic and/or
epidemic character (e.g. Paris, Lorraine or Philadelphia)
were isolated in different countries (France, England,
Spain, US) and in different years. Two strains were
newly sequenced for this study (Lorraine and HL 0604
1035), the other four L. pneumophila genomes (Paris,
Lens, Philadelphia, Corby) have been published previously [4,24,25]. The genomes of L. pneumophila

Lorraine and HL 0604 1035 consist each of a single circular chromosome of 3.4 Mb. Strain Lorraine also contains a plasmid. As shown in Table 1, the main features
of the six L. pneumophila genomes analyzed (e.g. genome size, GC content and coding density), are highly
conserved. The core genome of the six L. pneumophila
genomes comprises 2434 genes, which represents about
80% of the predicted genes in each genome. Furthermore, the gene order is highly conserved as the 260 kb
inversion in strain Lens with respect to the other strains
is the only exception. When comparing the strains two
by two, in average 90% of the genes are present in both
strains (Figure 1). However, when determining the nonorthologous genes specific of each genome and not present in the remaining 5 strains, each strain contains
between 136 (strain HL 0604 1035) and 222 (strain
Corby) strain specific genes mainly encoded on mobile
genetic elements. Taken together, the L. pneumophila
genomes have a highly conserved and syntenic backbone
and a highly dynamic accessory genome of about 300
genes each mainly formed by mobile genetic elements,
genomic islands and genes of unknown function. The
complete annotation of these six genomes is available in
a new data base resource that we have set up, LegionellaScope https://www.genoscope.cns.fr/agc/microscope/
about/collabprojects.php?P_id = 27 and at the Institut
Pasteur, LegioList http://genolist.pasteur.fr/LegioList/.
The species L. pneumophila has a highly conserved core
genome
a) Most eukaryotic like proteins are conserved in all L.
pneumophila genomes

The presence of proteins with high similarity to eukaryotic proteins or proteins with domains preferentially or
only present in eukaryotic genomes are a particular feature of L. pneumophila [4]. However, the criteria for
identifying these proteins were never clearly defined. To
analyze their evolution and possible origin in depth we

have thus developed an automatic and systematic
method to identify eukaryotic like proteins according to
defined criteria. Previously we had identified eukaryotic
like proteins in L. pneumophila as proteins with the

Figure 1 Shared and specific gene content of 6 L. pneumophila
genomes. Each petal represents a genome with an associated
color. The number in the center of the diagram represents the
orthologous genes shared by all the genomes. The number inside
of each individual petal corresponds to the specific genes of each
genome with non-orthologous genes in any of the other genomes.
The small circles inside of each petal represent the percentage of
shared genes (total number divided by the number of genes in the
smallest genome) between the genome of this petal and the
genome represented by the color of the small circle. Yellow circle
inside orange petal means that there are 88% of genes shared
among Corby and Lorraine.

highest similarity score to eukaryotic proteins according
to BLAST results, or by identifying eukaryotic domains
[4]. However, due to constantly growing databases
BLAST results are changing. Furthermore, recent analyses of amoeba-associated bacteria, in particular symbionts of amoeba have shown that they also contain
eukaryotic like proteins, suggesting multiple origins of
these proteins in prokaryotes [27]. To get a more complete picture of eukaryotic like proteins of L. pneumophila and also to include those proteins that might have
been transferred independently to different amoeba
associated bacteria we defined a eukaryotic like protein
as i) a protein having a better normalized blast score
against eukaryotic sequences than against prokaryotic
ones and ii) a protein that did not show BLAST results
against neither Legionella spp. nor other bacterial species for which resistance to amoeba infection has been
demonstrated (see material and methods). Applying
these criteria we identified 46 proteins with putative
eukaryotic origin, of which 17 are described here for the
first time (Table 2). Given the fact that these proteins
were probably acquired by HGT one would expect high
diversity in the repertoire. However, our analyses
revealed a considerable conservation as more than 50%
(26) are conserved in all six L. pneumophila strains,
indicating an ancient transfer. Furthermore, they show
89-99% nucleotide identity, probably due to high selection pressure for their maintenance. Thus most of these
proteins belong to the core genome, indicating that
their acquisition has taken place before the speciation of
L. pneumophila. These 26 proteins might have allowed a
common Legionella ancestor to colonize an intracellular
niche or to adapt better to the intercellular environment
of a specific protozoan species leading to the evolution
of the species L. pneumophila. Interestingly, 19 of these
26 proteins are also conserved in L. longbeachae, which
might thus be those indispensible for intracellular replication of Legionellae (Table 2) [28].
b) Eukaryotic protein motifs are highly conserved among
the L. pneumophila genomes

A second class of eukaryotic proteins of L. pneumophila
is carrying domains predominantly present in eukaryotic
proteins. To systematically identify these proteins we
used the Interpro database comprising 10 different
domain search programs [29]. This allowed to identify
the L. pneumophila proteins carrying eukaryotic
domains in the newly sequenced strains Lorraine and
HL 0604 1035 as well as to identify previously not
reported motifs. Similarly to the above described eukaryotic like proteins over half of the eukaryotic domain
coding proteins are conserved in all six genomes and
over 80% are conserved when two genomes are compared (e.g. 33 of the 39 proteins containing an eukaryotic motif in strain Lens are present also in strain Paris).

Page 4 of 24

Moreover half of them share very high nucleotide identity of in average 98%-100% (Table 3) again suggesting
high selection pressure to maintain them.
Our approach identified also new eukaryotic domains
like spectrin repeats. The spectrin repeat forms a threehelix bundle and was reported primarily in the animal
kingdom [30]. These repeats act as modules building
long, extended molecules that also serve as a docking
surface for cytoskeletal and signal transduction proteins.
In L. pneumophila it is present in up to eight proteins
of each strain (Table 3) and all spectrin repeat proteins
are predicted to be secreted Dot/Icm substrates [31-33].
Another interesting domain is the RAS GEF domain
that is present in two proteins encoded by strain Paris
one of which (Lpp0350) is conserved in the six strains
analyzed. Ras-GEFs are small GTPases typically present
in eukaryotes that are involved in numerous cellular
processes like gene expression, cytoskeleton re-organization, microtubule organization and vesicular and nuclear
transport [34]. GEFs (GDP-GTP exchange factors) regulate Rabs, GTP-binding proteins with conserved functions in membrane trafficking [35]. Interestingly,
according to the Pfam database Ras-GEF domains in
bacteria are only present in Legionella, Parachlamydia
acanthamoebae and Protochlamydia amoebophila, all of
which are amoeba-associated bacteria.
Coiled-coil domains have been identified previously in
the L. pneumophila genomes as this motif can be found
in all kingdoms of life. However extended coiled-coil
domains are largely absent from bacterial genomes but
are typical for archaea and eukaryotes. We thus
searched the L. pneumophila genomes and 29 other
genomes of bacterial pathogens or bacteria present in
the aquatic environment (Table 4) for proteins with five
or more coiled coil domains. Interestingly, Legionella
spp, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa contain the highest percentage of proteins with
extended coiled-coil domains (6-11 domains) compared
to the number of predicted proteins encoded in their
genome and only P. aeruginosa and L. pneumophila
encode proteins containing more than 10 coiled-coil
domains (Table 4). Most of these Legionella proteins are
predicted substrates of the Dot/Icm secretion system
[31-33,36]. This suggests that large coiled-coil domains
are specific adaptations to the eukaryotic cell probably
implicated in interactions with host proteins.
c) High selection pressure acts on the Dot/Icm T4SS and its
substrates

Central to the pathogenesis of L. pneumophila are the
dot/icm loci, which together direct assembly of a type
IV secretion apparatus [37,38]. Although all L. pneumophila strains investigated to date contain the complete
dot/icm loci, sequence variations among the dot/icm
genes among different L. pneumophila strains have been

*Substrates of the Dot/Icm secretion system according to previous publications; orthologs proteins where the corresponding motif was not present in the other
genome; § eukaryotic like proteins newly identified in this study; numbers, nucleotide identity with respect to the L. pneumophila Philadelphia gene; L.lo,
Legionella longbeachae

reported [39]. The dot/icm loci of the six strains analyzed here exhibited a very high nucleotide conservation
of 98-100% among orthologs except for dotA, icmX and
for icmC of strain Corby that is shorter and more divergent (84% nucleotide identity) as compared to icmC of
strain Paris. These results indicate that strong negative
selection acts on these genes (Table 5).
Since the identification of RalF [40], numerous
approaches have been used to identify Dot/Icm translocated substrates. Currently 278 proteins of L. pneumophila have been described as being transloctaed by the
Dot/Icm T4SS system [7,31,32,41-44]. Analysis of their
distribution among the six L. pneumophila strains
reveals a very high conservation, as 206 of the 278 substrates are present in all six strains. Nearly all of them
show a nucleotide similarity of 95-100% and only nine
are specific to strain Philadelphia (Additional file 1,
Table S1). Furthermore, only 34 of the 278 substrates of
strain Philadelphia are missing in strain Paris, 30 in
strain Lorraine or 25 in strain HL 0604 1035 (Additional
file 1, Table S1). Thus, although high redundancy seems
to be present in the repertoire of Dot/Icm effectors, the
strong conservation of nearly all of them in all genomes,
argues for their mutual importance for the L. pneumophila life cycle,
Rare exceptions are RalF and AnkB/Lpp2028. The
nucleotide sequence of ralF of strain Philadelphia is
only 85% similar to the ralF genes of the other strains
and is 72 nts (24aa) shorter. A similar situation is seen
for lpg2144/ankB that is 54 nts (18aa) longer in strain
Philadelphia and Lens than in strain Paris and Corby.
This is surprising, as the C-terminal region of AnkB of
strain Philadelphia contains a eukaryotic prenylation
CAAX motif mediating posttranslational modification of
effector proteins, important for intracellular replication
of L. pneumophila. Lipidation facilitates the localization
of this effector protein to host organelles and serves as a
docking platform for ubiquitinated proteins [45,46].
Thus in strain Paris and Corby other proteins might
take over this function. Taken together, this analysis
suggests that over 200 of the Dot/Icm substrates of L.
pneumophila have been present or have been acquired
before the speciation and that such a large repertoire of

effectors is indeed necessary for intracellular replication
and adaptation to the specific protozoan hosts.
The species L. pneumophila has a highly dynamic
accessory genome
a) A wide variety of T4ASSs and conjugative elements
contribute to genome plasticity

Based on sequence comparisons, T4SSs are categorized
according to their similarity to the A. tumefaciens VirB/
D4 system into type IVA (type F and P) and type IVB
secretion systems [47]. T4ASSs resemble the VirB/D4
system of A. tumefaciens, whereas T4BSS proteins are
more distantly related to the VirB/D4 proteins [48].
T4SSs are involved in effector translocation, horizontal
DNA transfer to other bacteria and eukaryotic cells, in
DNA uptake from or release into the extracellular
milieu or in the spread of conjugative plasmids [49].
Genome sequence analyses suggest that for L. pneumophila T4SSs play an important role for adaptation and
virulence as each genome encodes several T4ASSs in
addition to the essential T4BSS Dot/Icm discussed
above. We identified in each strain either F-type or Ptype T4ASSs or both. Figures 2 and Figure 3 show the
organization of the structural genes encoding these systems, their organization and their localization (chromosomal or plasmid). The F-type T4ASSs are all predicted
to encode a complete T4SS core as well as the essential
gene products for pilus assembly and mating pair stabilization that appears to be involved in DNA transfer.
They show homology and colinearity with the tra-region
of the E. coli F plasmid [50] and with the recently
described tra region of Rickettsia belii [51]. In L. pneumophila strain Philadelphia (Tra5) and L. longbeachae
strain NSW (Tra6), where the system has a chromosomal localization, it is inserted in a tRNA gene and flanking repeats are present as well as a gene coding for an
integrase, suggesting that these T4SSs are mobile (Figure
2). Furthermore, comparison of amino acid identities
revealed that the Tra- region on the L. pneumophila
strain Paris plasmid (Tra1) shows much higher identity
with the Tra region located on the L. longbeachae plasmid (Tra4) than with those of the different L. pneumophila strains (Paris-Tra1, Lens-Tra3 or Lorraine-Tra2)

(Figure 2). Thus these systems seem to be transferred
horizontally via plasmids but are also able to integrate
in the genome similar to what was reported for the Lvhregion [52].
The F-type T4SS encode long, flexible pili that allow
donors to mate in liquid and on solid media with equal
efficiencies [53]. In contrast P-type T4SS like described
in P. aeuroginosa encode short and rigid conjugative pili
that allow surface mating. Homologues to this system
are also present in the Legionella genomes. They were
initially described in two genomic islands of L. pneumophila strain Corby (Figure 3; Trb1 and Trb2) [54]. We
show here that they are also present in the chromosomes of L. pneumophila strain Lorraine (Trb3) and L.

longbeachae NSW150 (Trb4) (Figure 3). Again for all
T4SS regions flanking repeats are found suggesting
mobility, and protein identity values and GC-content
values of the tra-trb genes are higher than the genomic
average (38%), supporting again horizontal and not vertical transmission.
Another intriguing feature of these regions is that several transposases and phage related proteins are present
in each of the tra clusters as well as genes coding for
homologues of a putative phage repressor protein
(PrpA) and for homologues of LvrA, LvrB and LvrC,
first described for the Lvh region of L. pneumophila.
LvrC is a homologue of CsrA, a protein crucial for the
regulation of the switch between replicative and

transmissive phase of L. pneumophila [55]. It is tempting to assume that these CsrA homologues are implicated in the regulation of the mobility of these islands.
Possibly, dependent on the growth phase and/or on
metabolic cues L. pneumophila might excise these
islands as multiple copies could be advantageous in certain conditions, or perhaps allow high frequencies of
DNA transfer leading to fast and efficient adaptation to
new conditions. The genomic features of these islands
suggest a particular mechanism of mobility, which will
be interesting to investigate.
b) The L. pneumophila genomes encode systems specific for
protection against invading DNA and stabilization of large
genomic fragments

Bacteria have developed multiple methods of protection
against mobile genetic elements or bacteriophages. An
example for acquired phage specific immunity is clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats
(CRISPR) loci [56]. Another type of protection may be
conferred by toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems. Bacterial TA
systems are small genetic modules composed of a toxin
and antitoxin. While toxins are always proteins,

antitoxins are either RNAs (type I and III) or proteins
(type II) [57]. These systems were first described for
being dedicated to plasmid maintenance. Several lines of
research indicate that chromosomal TA systems might
serve as protection against mobile genetic elements such
as plasmids and phages. However, recent studies have
shown that type II systems are also involved in the stabilization of large genomic fragments and of integrative
conjugative elements [57]. Interestingly, type II TA systems are thought itself to be part of the mobilome and
to move from one genome to another through horizontal gene transfer [57].
Genome analyses identified several TA and CRISPR
systems. Interestingly, we identified only type II TA systems of which all except two are in a chromosomal
location (Table 6). However, of the 18 chromosomal
encoded TA systems identified at least 14 are located on
putative genomic islands or mobile genetic elements.
The two most frequently found TA systems in the L.
pneumophila genomes are homologues of the HigAB
and RelEB systems. HigAB was first described in the
Vibrio cholerae superintegron where it encodes mRNA

cleaving enzymes and can stabilize plasmids [58]. RelEB
was shown, when introduced into the E. coli chromosome to prevent deletion of flanking DNA and thus to
diminish large scale genome reduction [59]. The same
function was shown for the ParED system of Vibrio vulinificus, homologues of which are also present in one of
the L. pneumophila genomes (Table 6). Thus, the different L. pneumophila TA systems might be important for
stabilization of plasmids and integrative conjugative elements and for protection against invasion of plasmids,
phages, or other mobile genetic elements.
The CRISPR/cas system was shown to provide resistance against invading viruses and plasmids and has
been identified in many bacteria and archea [60].
CRISPR/cas loci are also present in the L. pneumophila
genomes of strains Paris, Lens, Alcoy and 130 b but are
absent from strains HL06041035 and Lorraine. According to the cas genes, the CRISPR locus of Paris is closely
related to that of strain 130 b. In contrast the one of
strain Lens located on the plasmid is closely related to
the chromosomal CRISPR locus of strain Alcoy as previously described [61]. Strain Lens carries a second
CRISR locus on the chromosome; however, it does not
seem to be functional like the one encoded by strain
Alcoy. Probably strong protection against invading
phages is not extremely important, as not all L. pneumophila strains contain CRISPR loci. This may be related
to their intracellular life style or that despite their widespread occurrence in aquatic environments only few
bacteriophages that specifically infect Legionella seem to
exist [62].
c) Accessory genome of strains Lorraine and HL 0604 1035

In order to get insight in the genetic basis of the two
newly sequenced strains, possibly implicated in their different disease frequencies (Lorraine is an newly emerging endemic clone and strain HL 0604 1035 is a L.
pneumophila Sg1 strain never isolated from disease) we
analyzed the specific gene content of each of these
strains more in depth. Strain HL 0604 1035 contains 92
and strain Lorraine 148 genes without homology to any
gene of the other five L. pneumophila strains sequenced
of which the majority (60 in strain HL 0604 1035 and
73 in strain Lorraine) code for proteins of unknown
function (Additional file 2, Tables S2 and additional file
3, Table S3). Among the genes in these two genomes
that lack an ortholog in the other sequenced L. pneumophila genomes, about 50% are clustered on three large
genomic islands. One genomic Island (GI-HL1) of 45 kb
spans from lpv2637 to lpv2691. It is bordered by a Met
tRNA gene and encodes a phage related integrase. A
second putative mobile element (GI-HL2) of 27 kbs
contains the region from lpv0193 to lpv0226. It is bordered at one side by an integrase and a reverse transcriptase (lpv0225) and on the other side by a prophage

Page 14 of 24

Rac integrase and a phage excisionase. Strain Lorraine
contains also a large genomic island (GI-Lo1) of 69 kb
that spans from lpo2442 to lpo2531. It is inserted in a
Met tRNA gene, contains a phage related integrase and
flanking repeats of 72 nts. Additional, smaller genomic
islands seem to be present, however, their borders are
difficult to define. Thus most of the strain specific genes
seem to be acquired by HGT through mobility of genomic islands.
Only for few of the specific genes a putative function
can be predicted like genes coding for proteins involved
in sugar and nucleotide metabolism, for uridine diphosphoglucuronate 5’-epimerase or for an UDP-glucose 6dehydrogenase. Furthermore a specific ANK motif containing protein and a leucine reach repeat protein are
present in strain HL 0604 1035. In strain Lorraine we
identified mainly specific metabolic enzymes like a putative flavanone 3-dioxygenase, an enzyme involved in flavonoids metabolism and in biosynthesis of
phenylpropanoids, which are secondary metabolites of
plants and algae. In addition, lpo2614 is predicted to
encode a kynurenine-oxoglutarate transaminase, an
enzyme that is part of the tryptophan metabolism and
lpo2960 codes for a putative glycolate oxidase that catalyses the conversion of glycolate and oxygen to glyoxylate and hydrogen proxide. lpo2502 codes a homologue
of CsbD, a general stress response protein of Bacillus
subtilis [63]. However, the best BLASTp hit is with the
Protochlamydia amoebophila homologue, an Acanthamoeba sp. symbiont [64]. Probably this gene has been
acquired by HGT between these two bacteria within
their amoeba host. Quite surprisingly, we identified a
gene coding a putative methyl-accepting chemotaxis
sensory transducer (lpv1770) although all L. pneumophila strains analyzed to date do not encode chemotaxis
systems. This gene shares 71.34% amino acid identity
with Llo3301 of L. longbeachae a protein that is part of
its chemotaxis system [28] also present in L. drancourtii
[65]. Probably a common ancestor encoded a chemotaxis system that was lost in L. pneumophila through a
deletion and degradation process.
d) Shared genome of the epidemic strains Paris and
Lorraine

A search for genes shared by the two endemic strains
but absent in all other strains identified only three genes
that fulfilled these criteria and for which a function
could be predicted. These encode the alpha, beta and
gamma subunits of a putative thiocyanate hydrolase
(lpo1236, lpo1237, lpo1238 and lpp1219, lpp1220,
lpp1221). Most interestingly, these strains are both common in France and strain Paris is also world-wide distributed [10] suggesting a better niche adaptation.
Indeed, thiocyanate compounds are used for cleaning
water circuits and these strains are thus probably able to

Gomez-Valero et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:536
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/536

better resist these treatments [66]. Furthermore, strain
Alcoy that is responsible for several outbreaks and many
cases of Legionnaires’ disease in Spain, also contains
these genes [61]. The genes coding the putative thiocyanate hydrolase have a GC content of 41-43%, which is
significantly higher than the average G+C content of the
L. pneumophila genome, which is 38%. When searching
for the closest homologues according to BLAST
searches we identified them in the genomes of Rhodococcus opacus strain B4 and Nocardia farcinica spp.
These two are high G+C Gram-positive bacteria belonging to the Actinomycetales, which are phylogenetically
not closely related to Legionella suggesting that L. pneumophila acquired these genes by horizontal gene
transfer.
Taken together, the analysis of the accessory gene
content showed again that L. pneumophila genomes
show high plasticity due to mobile genetic elements and

Page 15 of 24

HGT. No specific virulence related genes explaining
their different disease frequencies have been identified.
However, the identification of a specific thiocyanate
hydrolase might explain the wide distribution of strains
Paris and Lorraine as it may allow them to better
adapted to artificial water systems.
Evolutionary genomics
Phylogenetic reconstruction reveals extensive recombination

To analyze the relationship among the six different L.
pneumophila strains a phylogenetic reconstruction was
done based on a multilocus sequence (MLSA) approach
using 31 genes selected according to Zeigler [67] (Table
7 and Additional file 4, Table S4). These 31 genes were
chosen as they had been shown to be powerful for predicting the relatedness of bacterial genomes [67]. The
phylogeny obtained from their concatenated alignment
showed a well-resolved topology with bootstrap values

over 50%. To ascertain the reliability of the obtained
phylogenetic tree we established individual phylogenies
for each of the 31 genes. Surprisingly, the incongruence
among several gene trees was high. In addition the Consense program results did not support any node to at
least 50%. To further investigate these results we undertook a second analysis using a Shimodaira-Hasegawa
test and compared the topologies of the individual alignments of each gene and the concatenated alignment of
the 31 genes. As shown in Additional file 5, Table S5
the likelihood-based SH test for alternative tree topologies identified striking discordances. A possible explanation for the identified incongruences among the
phylogenies obtained in our study is the presence of
recombination events.
With the aim to explore whether recombination events
are present in the selected genes we undertook an in
depth analysis using the program RDP [68]. Indeed, the
analysis of individual genes identified intragenic recombination in 9 of the 31 genes (Table 8). Numerous additional recombination events were detected with the
concatenated alignment of the 22 genes for which no
intragenic recombination had been shown (Table 8). To
minimize false positive recombination events only those
that were supported by at least two of the six methods
used in RDP were taken into account. However, except
one, all were supported by at least three methods. No
artifacts resulting of positive selection should be included
in this analysis since all of the genes are either informational or operational (housekeeping). Most interestingly,
four of the genes in which intragenic recombination was
detected are housekeeping genes (pgk, atpD, ffh, metK).
Housekeeping genes allow to estimate the extent of
recombination within bacterial species since presence of
recombination in such “normally recombination free
genes” is indicative of a high rate of recombination [22].
Similarly antigen-coding genes of Legionella were
reported to show recombination events [18,69] and certain other genomic regions [17,19,70-72]. Another example of intragenic recombination in L. pneumophila is the
rtxA gene that contains a long tandem repeated domain
of variable copy number and sequence [4,10,73]. rtxA of
strain Lorraine and Corby share the same repeats,
whereas the other strains have unique types of repeats.
However, when including the newly sequenced strains
Lorraine and HL 0604 1035 we found that repeats of the
same type are shared by HL 0604 1035 and Philadelphia
and by Lorraine and Lens (Figure 4 and Additional file 6,
Table S6), further substantiating high intragenic recombination among strains.
To reconstruct the phylogenetic history of the species
L. pneumophila we used thus the concatenated alignment of the 31 genes described above. It gave a topology
with high bootstrap support, however recombination

Page 16 of 24

bias may result in high support for the wrong tree. To
avoid possible bias we thus analyzed the concatenated
alignment of the 31 genes using a split tree decomposition that allows a more realistic representation of the
phylogenetic relationships. Furthermore we constructed
a classical bifurcating tree using the highest possible
number of genes [all orthologs among the six strains
with (1867 genes) and without (2434 genes) L. longbeachae as outgroup]. As shown in Figure 5 the Splits
Decomposition phylogeny is network-like suggesting
incompatible partitions within sequence data, which
commonly arise from recombination. Although the phylogeny based on the orthologous genes can also be
affected by recombination, the high number of informative sites included in this data set, should allow recovering the correct history of the species as it has been
shown previously for other closely related bacterial species [74].
Taken together, in contrast to previous studies, which
reported that the species L. pneumophila is a clonal
population [13,14] our results show clearly that a high
recombination rate shapes the L. pneumophila genomes.
This finding is in line with the natural competence of L.
pneumophila. However, some worldwide distributed L.
pneumophila clones have been described (e.g. [10]), suggesting that L. pneumophila is able to develop a unique
genetic population structure within a particular region
or environment as reported recently [72].
Recombination of large chromosomal regions of over 200
kbs among L. pneumophila strains

Our recombination analysis revealed not only intragenic
recombination events but also intergenic recombination
as recombination was detected when using the entire
alignment even with only recombination free genes
(Table 8). This finding may be explained by the recombination of fragments encompassing several genes or
multiple recombination events involving smaller tracts
along the genome. To test this hypothesis we used a
method recently developed for the analysis of Streptococcus agalactiae genomes [75]. In order to identify patterns of recombination, nucleotide substitutions between
strains were counted in sliding windows across the previously defined core chromosome representing 15 possible pair wise comparisons. Each pair wise comparison
revealed highly conserved regions (<0.05% polymorphism on average) and less-conserved regions (>0.7% polymorphism),
suggesting
the
occurrence
of
recombinational exchanges. When analyzing the different strains in depth we identified in each genome several regions with very low polymorphisms (below 0.05%)
suggesting that DNA exchange of these fragments has
occurred between the different L. pneumophila strains.
Most interestingly, the two French strains Paris and HL
0604 1035 that are present since several years in France

have very low polymorphism and thus seem to have
been exchanged between them (Additional file 7, Figure
S1). In contrast when comparing strain Lens with the
other 5 genomes analyzed here, very few regions with
low polymorphism, two with strain HL 0604 1035 and
one with strain Lorraine, were detected. Furthermore,
no DNA exchanges seem to have occurred with strains
Corby, Philadelphia or Paris. This indicates that strains

that are frequent in the same environment (e.g. strain
Paris and HL 0604 1035) show high rates of DNA
exchange probably by conjugation as suggested for
Streptococcus agalactiae [75] and Enterococcus fecalis
[76]. In contrast strain Lens, which has been identified
to date only twice, in Lens (France) and in Germany,
very few DNA transfers with the studied L. pneumophila
strains seem to have taken place. Furthermore, some
regions may be transferred also between several strains.

sequences where the same color corresponds to the same type of repeat. Discontinues lines indicate that the exact number of repeats has not
been defined.

Figure 6 shows the distribution of single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) along 330 kb of the genome of
L. pneumophila HL 0604 1035, Philadelphia and Lorraine as compared to the same region in the genome of
strain Paris. We identified a region of 213 kbs a SNP
frequency of 0.005%. Except an indel of 158 bs that
shows higher polymorphism, only 11 SNPs are present
in this region. This fragment may have evolved by conjugative transfer and recombination between strains Philadelphia and Paris. Among others, this region carries
the genes necessary for lipopolysaccaride biosynthesis,
that are also part of the smaller fragment that has been
exchanged with strain HL 0604 1035. Our analyses suggest, that in addition to frequent intragenic recombination also recombination and horizontal transfer of large
chromosomal fragments is taking place and shapes the
chromosomes of L. pneumophila.

Conclusion
Analysis of the genome sequences of six L. pneumophila
strains shows that the genomes of this environmental
pathogen evolve by frequent HGT and high

recombination rates. Most interestingly, these events
take place between eukaryotes and prokaryotes and
among different strains and species of Legionella. A genome-wide map analysis of nucleotide polymorphisms
among these six strains demonstrated that each chromosome is a mosaic of large chromosomal fragments from
different origins suggesting that exchanges of large DNA
regions of over 200 kb have contributed to the genome
dynamics in the natural population. The many T4SS
might be implicated in exchange of these fragments by
conjugal transfer. Plasmids also play a role in genome
diversification and are exchanged among strains and circulate even between different species of Legionella.
Importantly, plasmids seem to excise and integrate into
the genome probably depending on environmental cues.
However, L. pneumophila encodes also several toxin
anti-toxin that might help to stabilize certain mobile
genetic elements. In the near future, the analyses of 100
s of genomes thanks to new generation sequencing
combined with molecular studies should provide further
clues about the genetic mechanisms and the evolutionary forces that shape the Legionella genomes.

Methods
Bacterial strains and sequence accession numbers

The strains sequenced in this study are L. pneumophila
strain Lorraine [EMBL: FQ958210, EMBL:FQ958212]
and L. pneumophila HL 0604 1035 [EMBL:FQ958211].
Strain Lorraine was isolated in 2004 from a patient and
was recently described as a newly emerging endemic
clone [26]. L. pneumophila strain HL 0604 1035 (ST
734, Bellingham subgroup of the Dresden panel) was
isolated in 2006 from a water supply system in a French
hospital that it is colonizing since more than 10 years.
Sequencing and assembly

The complete genome sequence of L. pneumophila
subsp. pneumophila strain HL06041035 (A) and strain
Lorraine (B) were determined using a Sanger/pyrosequencing hybrid approach. A shotgun library was constructed with 10kb size fragments, obtained after
mechanical shearing of the total genomic DNA, and
cloned into vector pCNS (pSU derived). Sequencing with
vector-based primers was carried out using the ABI 3730
Applera Sequencer. A total of 20736 (A) and 21888 (B)
reads (~4 fold-coverage) were analyzed and assembled
with 502731 (A) and 555541 (B) reads (~15 fold-coverage) obtained with Genome Sequencer GS20 (Roche
Applied Science). For the assembly, we used the Arachne
“HybridAssemble” version (Broad Institute, http://www.
broad.mit.edu) that combines the contigs obtained with
454 sequencing with Sanger reads. To validate the assembly, the Mekano interface (Genoscope), based on visualization of clone links inside and between contigs, was
used to check the clone coverage and misassemblies. In
addition, the consensus was confirmed using Consed
functionalities http://www.phrap.org: the consensus quality and the high quality discrepancies. The finishing step
was achieved by PCR, primer walking and in vitro transposition technology (Template Generation System™ II
Kit; Finnzyme, Espoo, Finland), and a total of 930 (A)
and 999 (B) sequences (109, 165 and 656 respectively for
L. pneumophila subsp. pneumophila strain HL06041035
and 62, 204 and 733 respectively for L pneumophila
subsp. pneumophila str. Lorraine) were needed for gap
closure and quality assessment.
Sequence analysis and annotation

The two newly sequenced L. pneumophila genomes
were integrated into the MicroScope platform [77] to
perform automatic and expert annotation of the genes,
and comparative analysis with the other L. pneumophila
strains already published. In addition the annotations of
the previously published genomes were updated. The
system integrates, for each predicted gene, the results of
multiple bioinformatics methods (Blast result on

Page 20 of 24

UniProt and specialized genomic data, InterPro, COG,
PRIAM, synteny group computation using the complete
bacterial genomes available at NCBI RefSeq, etc; more
information on the syntaxic and functional annotation
process is given in [78]). In addition, many genomic and
metabolic comparative tools are also available [77]. For
details see https://www.genoscope.cns.fr/agc/microscope/home/index.php.
Definition of orthologous genes

To define orthologous chromosomal genes among the
different L. pneumophila strains, pseudogenes and
mobile elements were not taken into account due to the
difficulty of ortholog assignment for these genes. Putative orthologous relations were defined as gene couples
fulfilling two criteria: (i) having a bidirectional best hit
(BBH) with an alignment threshold of 55% identity over
at least 60% of the query sequence and target size (ii)
and being in synteny. Subsequently, putative genes without any orthologous relation due to reduced identity
percentage were integrated in a pre-existing orthologue
group if they were flanked by orthologous genes showing gene order conservation (microsynteny). A final step
of manual curation was carried out for each doubtful
case.
Sequence alignments

For each gene of the selected data set, the nucleotide
sequence was aligned based on the amino acid sequence
using tranalign/EMBOSS package http://emboss.sourceforge.net/. Subsequently genes were concatenated in different data sets.
Identification of eukaryotic like proteins and eukaryotic
domain carrying proteins

Eukaryotic domains were identified by analyzing the
results obtained for all genes using the Interpro database
that is integrated in MAGE. For the identification of
eukaryotic like proteins we developed a new method.
First we constructed two databases, one containing all
and only eukaryotic sequences retrieved from public
databases and a second one containing all and only prokaryotic sequences. From the second database we
excluded the proteins of bacterial genera for which
eukaryotic like protein-domains have been found in
high proportions (e.g. parasites of protozoa) or bacterial
genera that are reported to establish a symbiotic relationship with amoeba (for a detailed list see Additional
file 8, Table S7). Those proteins, that showed a better,
normalized blast score against eukaryotic proteins than
to those present in the prokaryotic database were
retrieved as eukaryotic like proteins. Parameters established for blast were: minimum identity: 25%; minimum

Gomez-Valero et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:536
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/536

ratio avec query: 60%; minimum ratio avec target: 50%.
The final results were manually checked.
Phylogenetic Analysis

For phylogentic reconstruction of the L. pneumophila
strains analyzed in this work several data sets were used:
(i) 31 housekeeping genes described to be essential for
all prokaryotes were selected based on the study of Zeigler [67] (Table 7 and Additional file 9, Figure S2) for a
multi locus sequence analysis (MLSA) approach for
which gene each was analyzed individually and as a concatenated alignment, (ii) a concatenated alignment of
2434 orthologous genes present in all analyzed L. pneumophila strains (iii) a concatenated alignment of 1867
orthologous genes present in all analyzed L. pneumophila strains and in the selected out group, Legionella
longbeachae strain NSW150. An analysis of genetic
divergence was performed using DNAsp vs 5.00.07 [79]
using the 31 selected housekeeping genes. For phylogenetic reconstruction maximum likelihood (ML) methods
were used to infer phylogenetic relationships for all data
sets. Prior to ML analyses, a DNA substitution model
for each gene or data set was selected using Modeltest
v3.06 [80] and the Akaike information criterion. ML
heuristic searches were performed using 500 random
taxon-addition replicates with tree bisection and reconnection (TBR) and branch swapping. ML bootstrap support was determined using 1000 bootstrap replicates.
The ML best trees were rooted on L. longbeachae when
added. A network reconstruction was done for the same
data set (i) using SplitsTree4 (version 4.10) [81]. The
NeighborNet method and the GTR distance model were
used to create the network.
Congruence test

The 31 genes selected for a MLST approach were tested
for the significance of topological differences in the
obtained phylogenetic trees using several methods. The
first approach was based on the consensus of individual
gene trees. The consensus tree was inferred using the
CONSENSE program in the PHYLIP package http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html applying the
extended majority rule. Secondly we tested the significance of topological differences in phylogenetic trees
using the Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) test. The SH test
compares the likelihood score (-lnL) of a given data set
across its ML tree versus the -lnL of that data set across
alternative topologies, which in this case are the ML
phylogenies for other data sets. The differences in the
-lnL values are evaluated for statistical significance using
1000 replicates based on resampling estimated with the
log-likelihood (RELL) method (PAUP version 4.0b10;
http://paup.csit.fsu.edu/. We applied the test using all

Page 21 of 24

the trees obtained with individual genes, with the concatenated alignment against the alignment of each individual gene and with the alignment of all the 31 genes
concatenated.
Recombination analysis

The 31 genes selected for a MLST approach and its corresponding concatenated alignment, were screened for
the presence of putative recombination events by using
RDP 2.0b08 [82]. This program identifies recombinant
sequences and recombination breakpoints applying several methods. We selected six of them; two phylogenetic
methods (which infer recombination when different
parts of the genome result in discordant topologies):
RDP [68], 2000) and Bootscanning [83]; and four
nucleotide substitution methods (which examine the
sequences either for a significant clustering of substitutions or for a fit to an expected statistical distribution):
Maxchi and Chimaera [84], GeneConv [85] and Sis-scan
[86]. We considered only those recombination events in
our analysis that were identified by at least two methods. The common settings for all methods were (i) to
consider sequences as circular, (ii) a statistical significance of P < 0.05, and (iii) a Bonferroni correction for
multiple comparisons implemented in RDP.
