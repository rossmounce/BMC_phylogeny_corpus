Y-chromosome phylogeny in the evolutionary net
of chamois (genus Rupicapra)
Trinidad Pérez1, Sabine E Hammer2, Jesús Albornoz1 and Ana Domínguez1*

Abstract
Background: The chamois, distributed over most of the medium to high altitude mountain ranges of southern
Eurasia, provides an excellent model for exploring the effects of historical and evolutionary events on
diversification. Populations have been grouped into two species, Rupicapra pyrenaica from southwestern Europe
and R. rupicapra from eastern Europe. The study of matrilineal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and biparentally
inherited microsatellites showed that the two species are paraphyletic and indicated alternate events of population
contraction and dispersal-hybridization in the diversification of chamois. Here we investigate the pattern of
variation of the Y-chromosome to obtain information on the patrilineal phylogenetic position of the genus
Rupicapra and on the male-specific dispersal of chamois across Europe.
Results: We analyzed the Y-chromosome of 87 males covering the distribution range of the Rupicapra genus. We
sequenced a fragment of the SRY gene promoter and characterized the male specific microsatellites UMN2303 and
SRYM18. The SRY promoter sequences of two samples of Barbary sheep (Ammotragus lervia) were also determined
and compared with the sequences of Bovidae available in the GenBank. Phylogenetic analysis of the alignment
showed the clustering of Rupicapra with Capra and the Ammotragus sequence obtained in this study, different
from the previously reported sequence of Ammotragus which groups with Ovis. Within Rupicapra, the combined
data define 10 Y-chromosome haplotypes forming two haplogroups, which concur with taxonomic classification,
instead of the three clades formed for mtDNA and nuclear microsatellites. The variation shows a west-to-east
geographical cline of ancestral to derived alleles.
Conclusions: The phylogeny of the SRY-promoter shows an association between Rupicapra and Capra. The
position of Ammotragus needs a reinvestigation. The study of ancestral and derived characters in the Ychromosome suggests that, contrary to the presumed Asian origin, the paternal lineage of chamois originated in
the Mediterranean, most probably in the Iberian Peninsula, and dispersed eastwards through serial funding events
during the glacial-interglacial cycles of the Quaternary. The diversity of Y-chromosomes in chamois is very low. The
differences in patterns of variation among Y-chromosome, mtDNA and biparental microsatellites reflect the
evolutionary characteristics of the different markers as well as the effects of sex-biased dispersal and species
phylogeography.

Background
Phylogenetic relationships within and between animal
species often depend on the markers studied, as different genes might have different modes of transmission
and different histories [1-3]. In addition, hybridization
can result in discordant phylogenies between markers.
Increasing evidence points to a contribution of reticulate

evolution to the speciation process [4-7]. In this context,
information on the phylogenies of different markers for
closely related species and subspecies is important to
the study of processes underlying speciation [8].
The study of chamois (Rupicapra spp.) allows exploring the effect of historical and evolutionary events on
diversification. It is distributed over most of the medium
to high altitude mountain ranges of southern Eurasia
(Figure 1). At present, chamois populations are classified
into two species, R. pyrenaica and R. rupicapra [9], on
the basis of morphological and behavioral characters:

R. rupicapra

Figure 1 Geographic distribution of the subspecies of the genus Rupicapra. Sampling sites are indicated by circles. The map was modified
from the distribution map on the IUCN Red List [73].

Rupicapra pyrenaica (with the subspecies parva, pyrenaica and ornata) from southwestern Europe, and R.
rupicapra (with the subspecies cartusiana, rupicapra,
tatrica, carpatica, balcanica, asiatica and caucasica)
from central and southeastern Europe and western Asia
[10]. Analysis of genetic variation in a limited number
of subspecies for allozyme loci [11], minisatellites [12],
RFLPs of mitochondrial DNA [13] and the major histocompatibility complex [14,15] provided some support
for this classification. However, the nominal species are
paraphyletic for mtDNA [16,17].
The Quaternary glacial ages probably had a major
effect on the phylogeography and evolution of the genus
Rupicapra, as it did on other animals in Eurasia [18-21].
The Rupicaprini are thought to have originated in Asia
during the Miocene period and the sudden appearance
of Rupicapra fossils in Europe during the middle Pleistocene age has been interpreted as resulting from immigration from the east during a cold climatic phase [21].
In contrast with the fossil record, the divergence
between the main mtDNA clades has been estimated
around 1.5-3 mya [16,17,22-25] but this cannot be
directly assumed to be the divergence time between species. The mitochondrial phylogeny showed three main
lineages, originating during the Early Pleistocene [16,17].
Nuclear microsatellite genotypes formed three clearly
defined groups as well; however those groups did not
exactly match the mitochondrial lineages but are closer
to morphology and taxonomic classification. The phylogeographic patterns suggest an evolutionary history with
range contractions and expansions related to climatic
oscillations during the Quaternary period and reflect a
major effect of the Alpine barrier on west-east differentiation. The contrasting phylogenies of mtDNA and

nuclear microsatellites for populations of Chartreuse
and the western Alps indicated events of range overlap
and hybridization among highly divergent lineages in
the central area of the distribution. Both markers
showed differentiation between all pairs of populations
[16,17,26] and a geographic signature in the distribution
of variability, suggesting that differentiation occurred
without major migrations.
To further elucidate the processes leading to the origin and diversification of Rupicapra, we studied the Ychromosome. The Y-chromosome is paternally inherited
and does not undergo recombination at meiosis, providing a marker to study male dispersal [27-29]. The study
has the dual purpose of studying the patrilineal phylogenetic position of chamois, compared with Capra, Ovis
and Ammotragus, and the male dispersal within the
genus Rupicapra. We present the analysis of a sequence
of a fragment of the SRY gene promoter together with
two male-specific microsatellites UMN2303 and
SRYM18, in a sample set of 87 males, 40 of R. pyrenaica
and 47 from R. rupricapra, which covers the entire distribution range of chamois. Comparison of the geographic distribution of male-specific markers with
mtDNA lineages (defining matrilines) and autosomal
markers (biparentally inherited) allows us to follow the
evolutionary history of Rupicapra in the context of the
climatic oscillations of the Pleistocene age.

Results
SRY promoter sequences

We have amplified and sequenced 569 nucleotides corresponding to a fragment of the SRY gene promoter
from 52 male chamois, 24 of the subspecies R. pyrenaica
(14 parva, 6 pyrenaica and 4 ornata) and 28 of R.

rupicapra (5 cartusiana, 6 rupicapraW, 6 rupicapra CE,
3 tatrica, 3 carpatica, 2 balcanica, 1 asiatica and 2 caucasica). The alignment resulted in only two haplotypes,
one in R. pyrenaica and the other in R. rupicapra.
These haplotypes differ only in one nucleotide (site 267
in our alignment), which is A in the haplotype pyrenaica
and G in rupicapra.
To investigate the evolutionary history of the Y-chromosome of Rupicapra, the two haplotypes were aligned
with the sequences of other Bovidae available in the GenBank, Ammotragus lervia, Capra hircus, Ovis aries and
Bos taurus (see Table 1). In addition, two individual
Ammotragus lervia have been sequenced in our laboratory and both had identical sequence with a deletion of
44 nucleotides with respect to the rest of Bovidae. The
aligned dataset contains 531 nucleotides (481 nt, indels
excluded) with 78 variable sites of which 34 are fixed and
44 are variable among Caprinae. The phylogenetic relationships were studied using Neighbor-Joining, Maximum Likelihood, Maximum Parsimony, or Bayesian
approaches under different models of nucleotide substitution, either the simple model of Jukes-Cantor or the
substitution model that describes better the substitution
pattern of the dataset, a Tamura 3-parameter model [30]
with non-uniformity of evolutionary rate among sites
(T92+G). The three parameters were nucleotide frequencies 0.3392 for A and T, 0.1608 for C and G, Ts/Tv ratio:
1.6281 and rate heterogeneity: 0.4762. For the construction of the Bayesian tree, the model of nucleotide substitution was HKI+G (also appropriate to describe the
observed substitution pattern since it has the second lowest BIC score obtained with MEGA) and the parameters
were obtained by the program BEAST itself. There were
36 parsimony-informative sites. Model-free Parsimony
Analysis performed with MEGA led to three equally parsimonious trees with a total length of 87 steps. The different methods of tree construction all led to topologies

grouping Ovis with the published sequences of Ammotragus and the other grouping Rupicapra, Capra and the
sequence of Ammotragus obtained in this work. The relationships within this second group varied, depending on
the method used for tree construction, and they were
poorly supported. All the 10 different Bovidae sequences
present, like pyrenaica, A in site 267 in our alignment,
suggesting that this is the ancestral haplotype.
The estimated divergence time of the two Rupicapra
haplotypes from the SRY promoter sequence was 655
kya (95% CI: 10-1,611). The mean substitution rate per
nucleotide calculated with TRACER from the MCMC
samples was 2.09E-3 ± 1.08E-5 per million years.
Y-chromosome microsatellites

Out of 14 microsatellite markers tested, only UMN2303
and SRYM18 produced male-specific products.

Amplification from 87 males, 40 of R. pyrenaica and 47
from R. rupricapra, revealed two different length fragments for UMN2303 and seven for SRYM18 (Table 2).
For each microsatellite, fragments within each length variant were further analyzed by cloning and sequencing, and
the architecture was compared with their homologous loci
in other Bovidae. The UMN2303 repeated motif was
found to be [TTTTG]n differing from the repeat [TG]n
reported in Bos taurus. Rupicapra pyrenaica presented
two alleles, 125 and 130, differing in one repetition, and R.
rupicapra was monomorphic, with only the 125 allele.
The microsatellite SRYM18 lacks the pentanucleotide
[TTTTG] and the dinucleotide [TG] motifs common in
sheep [31] and instead presents a trinucleotide [TTC]m
and a mononucleotide [T]n motifs. Rupicapra pyrenaica
haplotypes were [TTC]mA[T]n and R. rupicapra haplotypes were [TTC] m [T] n , these two structures were
reported in Ammotragus lerviae (Acc. N° DQ272449) and
Ovis aries breed Balami (Acc. N° DQ272459.1), respectively. Combinations of variation in number of repeats in
both motifs in R. rupicapra resulted in homoplasy, where
PCR products with the same size had different sequence
architecture. The trinucleotide motif, [TTC]m, was polymorphic in the species R. rupicapra but not in R. pyrenaica while the mononucleotide motif was polymorphic in
both subspecies (Table 2).

Network of Y haplotypes

Altogether, ten haplotypes could be differentiated in the
Rupicapra genus (Table 2). Total Y-chromosome haplotype diversity was 0.82 with on average one distinct haplotype over 8.7 individuals (87/10). Three private
haplotypes were found in west chamois R. pyrenaica,
giving a haplotypic diversity of 51.50% and the other
seven haplotypes were private of the east chamois R.
rupicapra with a diversity of 74.69%.
The network of haplotypes (Figure 3) revealed two
haplogroups that concur with the taxonomy of chamois.
These two clades are separated by two nucleotide substitutions (one in the SRY promoter and one in the
SRYM18 microsatellite) and a mean distance of 2.11
microsatellite repeats. The connections between haplotypes show a strong geographic signal with links always
between neighboring populations. The same network is
obtained whether or not the nucleotide substitutions are
included.

Discussion
Analysis of chromosome Y presented a pattern of variation different from the one obtained from either mitochondrial or biparental nuclear DNA, both on diversity
as well as on the spread and geographic boundaries of
dispersion. However, the east/west phylogeographic

accounted for by the different subspecies is represented in different colors as in Figure 1. Different types of mutations in each branch are
represented by different symbols (white square: SNP; black squares with a number inside: microsatellites with mononucleotide [1], trinucleotide

signal in the distribution of haplotypes is present again
and once more the suture zone places in the Alps. It is
remarkable that, contrary to mtDNA and autosomal
microsatellites that formed three clades (although not
exactly concordant), the variation for the Y-chromosome
conforms to the two species currently accepted, Rupicapra pyrenaica and R. rupicapra. This could explain the
concurrence of coat patterns, cranial morphometry and
several courtship behavioral patterns in Iberian and
Apennine chamois [10,21,32] that remained unexplained
from the study of mtDNA and nuclear microsatellites
[33].
Phylogenetic relationships between chamois and other
caprini

The phylogeny of SRY promoter shows an association
between Rupicapra, Capra and the Ammotragus
sequence obtained in this work (Ammotragus 2). This
association concurs with the relationships revealed from
the study of the complete mitochondrial genome [34].
Previously, Meadows and Kijas [35] reported a very
close relation between the SRY promoter of Ammotragus (Ammotragus lervia 1 in Table 1 and Figure 2) and
Ovis, but we found 15 differences (3.33%) between this
previously reported sequence and the new sequences
produced in our laboratory (Ammotragus lervia 2 in
Table 1 and Figure 2). This large difference is not
expected between two individuals of the same species.
In contrast, the reported sequence of Ammotragus presents only 4 differences (0.83%) with Ovis canadensis.
Our sequence has been obtained from good quality samples (muscle) from two specimens (both repeated twice)

with identical results. So, we think that the sequence
reported by Meadows and Kijas could be contaminated
with DNA of Ovis canadensis. An alternative interpretation to take into account is the polyphyly of Ammotragus. The affinities of Ammotragus with either Capra or
Ovis have been widely discussed in the literature as it
exhibits a particular combination of goat-like and sheeplike characters [36]. The structure of the microsatellite
SRYM18 of west chamois is identical to Ammotragus
and different to most Ovis, but the African breed Balami
of O. aries shares the repeat structure with Ammotragus
and Rupicapra. This observation had lead Meadows and
Kijas [31] to hypothesize the possible gene flow from
Barbary to domestic sheep. The observed similarities
between Ammotragus lerviae and the genus Rupicapra
and the apparent spread of male chamois south to north
reopen the question of the possible position of Ammotragus as an ancestor of the Caprinae [37]. It can also
be noted that Rupicapra and Ammotragus have similar
karyotype with 58 chromosomes [38]. Additional studies
of Y-chromosome phylogenies of Caprinae could offer
very important information to clarify this issue.
Patrilineal phylogeography of chamois

When comparing the phylogenetic trees based on
mtDNA or the sequences of the SRY promoter (Figure
4), a clear difference emerges. All the Rupicapra belong
to one unique clade for the SRY promoter while three,
well differentiated, clades formed for mtDNA. The
observed number of substitutions per nucleotide
between the pairs of species Ovis-Rupicapra, CapraRupicapra and Ovis-Capra for the sequences of mtDNA

branches is indicated in parentheses.

in our former study [17] were 0.1125, 0.1264 and 0.1186
respectively to be compared with 0.0520, 0.0346 and
0.0489 substitutions per nucleotide respectively for the
SRY promoter sequence. The distance between pairs of
species for mtDNA is about two or three times that of
the SRY promoter, consistent with observations in other
mammals including humans [39-42]. The level of differentiation among Y-chromosomes in chamois is remarkably low. The haplogroups Y-Rpyr and Y-Rrup within
the Rupicapra genus differ by one single nucleotide,
leading to an estimated average number of substitutions
per nucleotide of 0.0019 that is 24.6 times lower than
the average distance between the three clades of
mtDNA (0.0468). The time of divergence between the
SRY haplotypes estimated from the phylogenetic tree
places the split 655 kya, in the middle of the Pleistocene.
Thus, all modern chamois seem to descend of one very
young male lineage. The low diversity in the number of
microsatellite repeats, both between species and within
species, compared with the Y-specific evolutionary
mutation rate of 2.6 × 10 -4 mutations per generation
[43], gives further support to this interpretation. Thereafter, our data suggest that the divergence of Y-chromosomal variants took place well after the divergence of
mtDNA lineages [17,22,44], in a period compatible with
the sudden appearance of Rupicapra fossils in Europe
[21].
The examination of the Y-chromosome network of
haplotypes offers insight into the patrilineal history of
dispersion. There is an association between the network
of haplotypes and geography (see Figure 3) with a westeast cline of ancestral to derived chromosomes and the
signature of the Alpine barrier. Attending to the SNP in

the SRY promoter it can be noted that the haplogroup
Y-Rpyr presents the ancestral plesiomorph state (A in
position 267 in our alignment), shared by all the other
species in the phylogeny, while the haplogroup Y-Rrup
has the derived state G (transition A > G). Regarding
the SNP in the microsatellite SRYM18, Y-Rpyr presents
the nucleotide A like Ammotragus, hence it could be
assumed to represent the ancestral state, while Y-Rrup
presents T (transversion A > T). From here we propose
that one of the haplotypes of the Y-pyr group represents
the ancestral state. The pattern of microsatellite variation within each haplogroup also supports this interpretation as explained below. First, let us recall that the
mutation profiles of microsatellites depend on the size
of the repeat motif, the rate of mutation of pentanucleotides is about half of that of trinucleotides, and mononucleotide repeats present a very high mutation rate
[45]. Our data on pentanucleotide, trinucleotide and
mononucleotide difference between R. pyrenatica and R.
rupicapra in number of repeats (0.65, 1.13 and 4.55,
respectively) concur with this observation. Hence,
microsatellites with longer motifs retain a stronger phylogenetic signal than shorter ones. It has been shown
that in microsatellites with few repetitions, mutation is
biased towards increase in number of repeats [46,47].
Attending to the network of haplotypes, it can be seen
that Rpyr2, sampled from R. p. pyrenaica and R. p.
parva, presents the lowest number of repeats for all, the
penta, the tri and the mononucleotide motifs, this is
probably the closest to the basal haplotype. The number
of repeats of the pentanucleotide microsatellite
UMN2303 is variable only in western chamois, the allele
130, with one additional repeat is found in R. p.

Pérez et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:272
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/272

pyrenaica and R. p. parva. The number of trinucleotide
repeats and mononucleotide repeats of SRYM18
increases west to east. The mononucleotide motif seems
to have suffered mutations forth and back in the eastmost populations.
We conclude that the patrilineal dispersion of Rupicapra was south-west to north-east. The cline of ancestral
to derived chromosomes could be originated by serial
funding events, probably related to the glacial-interglacial cycles of the Quaternary. Male dispersion could
start from the Iberian Peninsula or from Italy (Figure 5)
to the east and the two haplogroups differentiate one to
each side of the Alps. The lower number of repeats
points to haplotype Rpyr2 present in Iberia as the closest to the ancestor. Alternatively, the haplotype Rpyr3
in the center of the network and differing from Rpyr2
solely in the mononucleotide could be also a good
candidate.
Differences between markers in patterns of variation and
the evolutionary history of chamois

The discordant patterns of mtDNA and autosomal
microsatellites that have been described in a previous
study [17] indicated the occurrence of hybridization
among divergent lineages of chamois in the central area
of the distribution. Chromosome Y data add complexity
to this mosaic; the geographical sorting of variation for
the different kind of marker is summarized in Figure 5.
The three kinds of markers have specific evolutionary
characteristics that need to be taken into account to
explain differing variation patterns [27]. These differences are on (1) mutation rates, (2) selection, (3) effective population size and (4) dispersal. (1) Being the Y a
male-specific chromosome, and given that the mutation

Page 7 of 12

rate is higher in males than in females [48], we would
expect higher divergence for Y-chromosome than for
autosomal microsatellites; our data are contrary to this
expectation. (2) Positive selection could act on the
whole Y-chromosome and, given that the Y-chromosome does not recombine, it will be selected as a block
in a selective sweep with the consequence of homogenization [28]. In addition, the lack of recombination must
be responsible for the effect known as Muller’s ratchet,
the random accumulation of deleterious mutations that
cannot be removed by recombination [49,50]. Selection
against these mutations further reduces variability.
Selection has been proposed as the main factor to
explain low levels of genetic variability in the Y-chromosome [51] and must contribute to the reduced variability
among Y-chromosomes in chamois. A similar pattern
was found in Ursidae where Y-chromosome genes have
fewer substitutions than expected in external branches
[41]. (3) The chromosome Y and mtDNA both have
effective population size of one quarter of that of an
autosome because they are haploid and transmitted by
one sex, but the effective population size of Y-chromosome must be lower because the variance in number of
descendants is larger in males than in females, especially
in a polygynous species. Hence, the Y-chromosome is
more prone to genetic drift effects. However, genetic
drift cannot be invoked as the main cause for the Ychromosome phylogeography because in such case no
such strong geographical signal would be expected. (4)
Differences in male and female dispersal can be related
to different patterns of variation for patrilineal, matrilineal and biparental markers. Recent migration of males
could be responsible of the low Y-chromosome diversity
observed.

Taking into account the above considerations,
together with the assumed Asiatic origin of Rupicapra
and the similarity of the Y-chromosome of Rupicapra
and Ammotragus, we propose two speculative hypotheses to explain the observed results: a) The Rupicapra
genus has its origin in southern Europe and spread west
to east. The differences in divergence between mtDNA
and Y-chromosome are due to the particular evolutionary characteristics of the Y-chromosome, or b) males
from an ancestral population highly differentiated from
a second ancestral taxa present in Europe entered from
the south, hybridizing and spreading westwards. Under
the first hypothesis, the origin of the genus Rupicapra
needs to be placed in south Europe from where it
spread eastwards. This is contrary to the general belief
that chamois, as caprines in general, originated in Asia
[21] but, following Ropiquet and Hassanin [23], this
hypothesis is not really supported by the fossil record.
These authors propose that caprines originated in the
Mediterranean islands during the Miocene and from
here may have invaded Africa, Europe and Asia after the
Tortonian salinity crisis (7.8-7.6 mya) or after the Messinian salinity crisis (6-5.3 mya). The similarity among Ychromosomes under this hypothesis must be attributed
to male dispersal and female phylopatry, together with
selective sweeps and purifying selection that acted over
the chromosome as a whole. The second hypothesis is
the hybridization between two ancestral Caprinae in the
beginning of the evolutionary history of the genus Rupicapra. The hybridization between highly divergent
lineages at speciation of Rupicapra had been previously
hypothesized after the observation of a pseudogene of
cytochrome b from a highly divergent lineage in the
nucleus of present day chamois [24,37,52]. An ancestral
Caprinae related with Ammotragus could have reached
the south Mediterranean, most probably the Iberian
Peninsula, and hybridize with the ancestral Rupicapra
female. The dispersal of species across the strait of
Gibraltar during Pleistocene has been proposed for
other vertebrates [40,53,54] and has been related to the
substantially lower sea level associated with major Pleistocene glaciations [40]. New male Y-chromosome
lineages would have dispersed during the Pleistocene,
replacing older ones. Hybridization, after secondary contact among related taxa, has been inferred in the evolution of the genus Capra [55] as well as in the evolution
of some species of Bos [56] and has been recently
observed between native and introduced species of Cervus in Scotland [57]. It can be added that hybrids from
Ammotragus male and Capra female have been artificially obtained [58]. Many recent studies have shown
contrasting phylogenies for different kinds of markers
that lead to the view of hybridization as an important
mechanism in the evolution of animal species [5,7].

Our results on Y-chromosome reconcile the sudden
occurrence of Rupicapra in the middle-late Pleistocene
with the existence of very old mtDNA lineages. In addition, the proposed migration of chamois west to east
can explain the reported more conservative features of
R. pyrenaica [33]. The alternative hypotheses presented
here can be tested in future research that includes the
comparative study of chromosome Y in a broader representation of Caprinae and additional nuclear sequences
of the different populations of Rupicapra to search for
the signature of possible hybridizations.

Conclusions
The Y-chromosome is highly informative to follow the
dispersal of populations of Caprinae. The phylogenetic
analysis of the SRY gene promoter shows an association
between Rupicapra, Capra and Ammotragus, not in
agreement with a previous report, which grouped
Ammotragus with Ovis. The structure of the SRYM18
microsatellite of Rupicapra is equal to Ammotragus and
the African breed Balami of O. aries. The patrilineal
relationships of Caprine deserve a reinvestigation.
Within Rupicapra, the diversity of Y-chromosomes is
very low. The combined data define 10 Y-chromosome
haplotypes forming a west-to-east geographical cline of
ancestral to derived alleles. Haplotypes form two haplogroups, which concur with taxonomic classification,
instead of the three clades formed for mtDNA and
biparental microsatellites. We propose that, contrary to
the presumed Asian origin, the paternal lineage of chamois originated in the Mediterranean, most probably in
the Iberian Peninsula, and dispersed eastwards through
serial funding events during the glacial-interglacial
cycles of the Quaternary. The differences in patterns of
variation among Y-chromosome, mtDNA and biparental
microsatellites reflect the evolutionary characteristics of
the different markers, as well as the effects of sex-biased
dispersal and species phylogeography.
Methods
Sampling, DNA extraction and sex determination

Samples of the 10 recognized subspecies of chamois
were collected from 1992 until the present, covering the
distribution range of the genus Rupicapra (see Figure 1)
and have previously been analyzed for autosomal microsatellites and mtDNA [16,17,26]. For large populations,
where hunting is allowed, samples were either of muscle
or skin preserved in 96% ethanol by gamekeepers, or
teeth from skulls sent to taxidermists. For protected
populations, samples were obtained from animals found
dead; tissues, as well as their conservation method, were
diverse (hair, bone, salted skin and muscle in ethanol)
and were sent by biologists. Two muscle samples of
Barbary sheep (Ammotragus lervia) one from Sierra

Espuña (Murcia, Spain) and the other from Caldera de
Taburiente (La Palma, Canary Islands, Spain) were
included.
Due to the different origin and type of the material
included in this study, different methods of DNA isolation were used. DNA from bones or teeth was extracted
by a method modified from Catanneo et al. [59] as
described [26]. For soft tissue samples, DNA was
extracted either with the phenol/chloroform method
[60] using Chelex, following Estoup et al. [61] or using
the ‘DNeasy Tissue kit’ (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).
Finally, 56 of the 215 samples were collected and the
DNA was extracted in the laboratory of Vienna (Austria) following the protocol described in the Genetic
Analysis Manual (LI-COR, Inc. 1999), followed by a
standard phenol/chloroform extraction and DNA precipitation procedure [60].
We determined the sex of each individual sampled
using the SE47/SE48 sex identification primers [62].
SE47/SE48 primers amplify one DNA fragment for
females (indicating the presence of X-chromosome) and
two for males (indicating the presence of a X and a Y
chromosome). Reactions were performed in a final
volume of 20 μl containing 2 μl (≈ 40-70 ng) DNA, 0.5
mM of each primer, 1x PCR Buffer, 200 mM of each
dNTP, 2.5 mM MgCl2 and 1 U of Taq DNA polymerase
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Amplification was carried
out in PE GeneAmp PCR 9700 thermal cycler (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with an initial step of 5
min at 94°C, 35 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 60°C and
1 min at 72°C, followed by 5 min at 72°C. PCR products
were visualized on 2% agarose gels, pre-stained with
ethidium bromide. We tested 222 samples, 135 were
discarded either because they were from females (83
samples) or they did not amplify (52 samples), and 87
male samples, 40 from R. pyrenaica and 47 from R.
rupicapra were used in the study of Y-chromosome.
Chromosome Y genotyping

A total of fourteen Y microsatellite loci and six Y-chromosome sequences were tested on chamois for amplification and male specificity (Pérez et al. in preparation).
Only two microsatellites, one bovine UMN2303 [63]
and one ovine SRYM18 [31] and one male specific
sequence, a fragment of the 5’-promoter of the sex
determining region Y (SRY) gene amplified with primers
designed from Ovis [31], gave consistent male-specific
products and were chosen for further analysis.
The microsatellite loci UMN2303 and SRYM18 were
amplified in 20 μl PCR reactions containing 2 μl (≈ 4070 ng) DNA, 0.5 mM of each primer, 2.5 mM MgCl2,
1x PCR Buffer, 200 mM of each dNTP, 2.5 mM MgCl2
and 1 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The annealing temperature was 55°C for

Page 9 of 12

SRYM18 and 58°C for UMN2303. Fluorescently labeled
forward primers were used. Amplification was carried
out using the PE GeneAmp PCR 9700 (Applied Biosystems). PCR products were checked in a 2% agarose gel
and the product diluted up to 100-fold depending on
the signal intensity. One microlitre of the dilution was
added to a 12 μl mix of formamide and ROX 400HD
(12:0.2) and loaded on an automatic sequencer ABI310
(Applied Biosystems). Microsatellite patterns were
examined both visually and using GENESCAN ANALYSIS 3.1 and GENOTYPER 2.5 software (Applied
Biosystems).
Sequencing was carried out either cloning the PCR
products (UMN2303 and SRYM18 STR loci) or directly
(SRY promoter). When cloning was needed, products of
amplification were purified using GFX PCR DNA and
Gel Band Purification Kit (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK), and they were directly cloned into the
PMOSBlue vector (Amersham Biosciences) and transformed into MOSBlue competent cells according to the
supplier’s specification. Clones were screened for inserts
of the expected size by PCR amplification with the universal primers M13 and T7. For selected clones, plasmid
DNA was prepared for sequencing following Sambrock
et al. [64]. For direct sequencing PCR-amplified products were purified with the Exo-SAP-IT kit (USB Corporation, Cleveland, OH). Sequencing reactions were
performed for both strands using the appropriate primers and the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing
Kit (Applied Biosystems). Sequencing products were
purified with isopropanol precipitation and sequenced in
an ABI 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The
raw sequence data were analyzed using the ABI Prism
DNA Sequencer Analysis software v3.4.1. After the
occasional observation of differences among the number
of mononucleotide repeats in the sequences from
SRYM18, the determination of allele size and sequence
was repeated for a subset of 16 samples. The results on
allele size were always repeatable while the sequences
presented errors due to slippage. Hence, the number of
mononucleotide repeats was adjusted according to allele
size.
Phylogenetic analysis of SRY promoter sequences

The SRY promoter sequences were manually aligned
and edited using MEGA5 [65]. The two different haplotypes identified in Rupicapra plus the sequence of
Ammpotragus lerviae were submitted to NCBI GenBank
(accession numbers in Table 1). The phylogenetic relationships of these haplotypes with the available
sequences of other Caprinae in the GenBank, Capra,
Ovis and Ammotragus were investigated using the
sequence of Bos taurus as outgroup. Neighbor-Joining
(NJ), Maximum Parsimony (MP), Maximum-Likelihood

Pérez et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:272
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/272

(ML) or Bayesian approaches were used under different
models of nucleotide substitution. All positions containing gaps were eliminated. A Neighbor-Joining (NJ) tree
of haplotypes based on the simple Jukes-Cantor distance
was constructed with MEGA. The reliability of the
nodes was assessed by 1,000 bootstrap replicates [66].
Additionally, the optimal substitution model was determined with MEGA 5 using the Bayesian Information
Criterion [67]. We used this model to analyze phylogenies both by NJ and Maximum Likelihood (ML) using
the Close-Neighbor-Interchange method as tree searching strategy. The topology of the tree was further investigated by model free Maximum Parsimony (MP) as
implemented in MEGA, using the Max-mini branchand-bound algorithm. The MP consensus tree was
inferred from 1000 bootstrap replicates. Bayesian analysis was conducted using the Monte Carlo Markov
Chains (MCMC) method implemented in BEAST v1.6.1
[68]. A relaxed lognormal model of lineage variation
and a coalescent prior with constant size, appropriate
when the alignments contain multiple intraspecific
sequences, were assumed. The model of nucleotide substitution was HKI+G (also appropriate to describe the
observed substitution pattern since it has the second
lowest BIC score obtained with MEGA). The empirical
nucleotide sequences and a gamma distribution of site
heterogeneity with 5 categories of substitution rates
were set as priors. Two replicates were run for 25 million generations with tree and parameter sampling every
1,000 generations. Subsequently, the sampling distributions of the two different replicates were combined
using LogCombiner and the resulting samples were
summarized using the software TreeAnnotator, using a
burnin of 2,500 and under the maximum clade credibility option. The percentages of samples recovering any
particular clade represent the clade posterior probability.
Trees were visualized and edited with FigTree [69].
Divergence time between the two haplotypes of chamois was estimated with BEAST after the analysis of the
sequences of Bos, Ovis, Capra and Rupicapra. The
sequences of Ammotragus were not included in this
analysis because of the inconsistence of its phylogenetic
position that we found in the previous analysis. The
conditions of the runs were as before and a relaxed
uncorrelated molecular clock was employed. As calibration we used the divergence times of Bovidae (mean
25.8 mya, standard deviation [SD] 0.6 mya), Caprinae
(mean 14.1 mya, SD 1.1) and Capra-Ovis (11.5 mya, SD
0.9) following Hernández-Fernández and Vrba [70] as a
normal distribution prior. We placed monophyly constrains on the group Caprinae and on the groups Ovis,
Capra and Rupicapra. The mean rate of nucleotide substitution and its standard deviations were obtained from
the Bayesian MCMC sampled values using the program

Page 10 of 12

TRACER. The analysis was repeated using the Yule speciation model as prior to check for the effects of the
assumed model in the estimate. In addition, the time of
divergence was also estimated using only one Ovis and
one Capra sequence (five sequences in total) to check
for the effects of having more than one sequence per
species on the estimated time of divergence.
Y microsatellite statistical analyses

We typed 87 individuals (40 of R. pyrenaica and 47 of R.
rupicapra) for the microsatellites UMN2303 and
SRYM18 according to size. The SRYM18 microsatellite
was found to be compound of two repeated motifs and
one SNP. The SNP was treated as a binary trait and the
variations in the number of repetitions of the two motifs
were treated as two markers. Thus microsatellite individual genotypes were arranged in a matrix of 3 repeated
motifs per 87 individuals.
Descriptive statistics analysis was performed with
MSAnalyzer v3.12 [71]. We calculated for each repeated
motif, in an EXCEL worksheet, the absolute difference
in number of repeats (Dad) between the pair of species
and its variance to check for differences associated to
the length of the repeated motif.
The evolutionary relationships between the haplotypes,
of the microsatellite markers alone or the combined
haplotypes including binary data (one SNP on the SRY
promoter and other SNP in the SRYM18 microsatellite),
were analyzed by a Median-Joining network [72] constructed with NETWORK 4.6 (Fluxus Technology Ltd.).
This method differs from traditional ones by allowing
extant haplotypes to occupy internal nodes. The parameter ε was set to zero (default) to obtain a sparse
spanning network. Haplotype components were
weighted (w) according to its mutability, increasing
weight for the components with lower mutation rate.
The weights were as follows: SRYM18 [T]n, w = 1;
SRYM18 [TTC]m, w = 2 and UMN2303 [TTTTG]m, w
= 3 for the microsatellites. In the network of haplotypes
including SNPs as well as microsatellite mutations, the
weight for the binary data was set to w = 4.
