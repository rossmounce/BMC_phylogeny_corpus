Abstract
Background: large scale and reliable proteins' functional annotation is a major challenge in
modern biology. Phylogenetic analyses have been shown to be important for such tasks. However,
up to now, phylogenetic annotation did not take into account expression data (i.e. ESTs,
Microarrays, SAGE, ...). Therefore, integrating such data, like ESTs in phylogenetic annotation could
be a major advance in post genomic analyses. We developed an approach enabling the combination
of expression data and phylogenetic analysis. To illustrate our method, we used an example protein
family, the peptidyl arginine deiminases (PADs), probably implied in Rheumatoid Arthritis.
Results: the analysis was performed as follows: we built a phylogeny of PAD proteins from the
NCBI's NR protein database. We completed the phylogenetic reconstruction of PADs using an
enlarged sequence database containing translations of ESTs contigs. We then extracted all
corresponding expression data contained in EST database This analysis allowed us 1/To extend the
spectrum of homologs-containing species and to improve the reconstruction of genes' evolutionary
history. 2/To deduce an accurate gene expression pattern for each member of this protein family.
3/To show a correlation between paralogous sequences' evolution rate and pattern of tissular
expression.
Conclusion: coupling phylogenetic reconstruction and expression data is a promising way of
analysis that could be applied to all multigenic families to investigate the relationship between
molecular and transcriptional evolution and to improve functional annotation.

Background
The "in silico" functional annotation of proteins generated by large scale sequencing projects is an important
challenge in biology. Here we propose a rigorous protocol
for multigenic families' annotation.

1/Importance of phylogenetic reconstruction
Because important functions are conserved during evolution, the first step in analysis is to determine homologous
sequences. More specifically, orthologs are more likely to
share the same function while paralogs can undergo funcPage 1 of 13

Phylogenetic tree built with PAD and NR database, with Danio-rerio's PAD sequence in out-group. This tree is
the fusion on the NJ topology, of three phylogenetic trees built based on Neighbour Joining (NJ) [36], Maximum Parsimony
(MP) [39], and Maximum Likelihood (ML) [40] methods. The tree is labelled npl-A at the first root (for Nj, mP, mL, with All
topology congruence tests passed). For each node, bootstrap values are reported for each npl method. A "*" means that the
bootstrap value was under 50%. PAD protein from Danio-Rerio is co-orthologous to all others PADs. In mammals five groups
of orthologs are found, named PAD-1, PAD-2, PAD-3, PAD-4 and PAD-6. PAD-2 paralogy group is the best conserved as it
evolved slower than the others.

tional shifts. Developments and improvements in database similarity search programs such as BLAST [1] allowed
the rapid identification of potential homologous
sequences and therefore allowed functional prediction of
several thousand of genes and proteins present in databases. However, the closest BLAST is often not the nearest
neighbor [2]. Indeed, similarity-based approaches do not
consider all the information from comparative and evolutionary biology. They do not differentiate between
orthologs and paralogs among homologs. So, phylogenetic approaches, taking into account duplication and
speciation events are necessary to robustly produce functional annotation of new, uncharacterized proteins [3-8].
2/Necessity to enlarge databases
For proteins' phylogenetic reconstruction, protein databases containing the proteomes of completely sequenced
species along with individually submitted protein
sequences are usually used (Ensembl protein db, NCBI
Protein db etc...) [9,10]. Yet, the vast majority of species
are not fully sequenced and most of their protein
sequences are still unknown. However, a lot of transcriptional information is carried by growing gene expression
databases, concerning normal or pathological tissues
(Expressed Sequence Tags from NCBI, TIGR, GeneNote,
Gepis etc...) [11-14]. These mRNAs could be used for
(total or partial) reconstruction of unknown proteins in
"not yet sequenced" species. In parallel, translation of EST
contigs can be used to enlarge the spectrum of species containing homologs when one analyses a protein family.
3/Importance of expression patterns' determination for an
accurate annotation
It should be noted that phylogenetic analysis can only
give information at the biochemical function level. Furthermore, while orthologs can have very similar "molecular function", they can exhibit different "macroscopic
functions", due to a transcriptional shift for example. To
produce an accurate proteic functional annotation, one
must have complete sequence information given by phylogenetic reconstruction, with expression patterns analysis.
This is the second reason why using data from expression
databases is interesting. Analysis of expression divergence
between paralogs and orthologs have been recently published in Human and Mouse. It appears that gene expression profiles diverge between paralogs. Orthologs can
diverge in their expression pattern too [15]. Moreover,
orthologs that have undergone recent duplication have
less strongly correlated expression profiles than those that
have not [16]. Up to now, there is no study examining
expression divergence between homologs that takes into
account a broad spectrum of species and after a phylogenetic reconstruction.

4/Our approach
We present here a new way to functionally annotate proteins in silico, taking into account all these concepts. In a
first step, we reconstructed the phylogeny of a protein
family, using an enlarged database containing 1/full
length proteins from NCBI NR protein database [10] and
2/translation of EST contigs from NCBI dbEST database
[11]. We used a new software platform, FIGENIX [17],
adapted to this kind of phylogenomic reconstruction. In a
second step, we created an automated pipeline to couple
these phylogenetic reconstructions with expression pattern data. We then compared the evolution rate of the different paralogous sequences with their patterns of
expression.

We validated this approach with the peptidyl arginine
deiminase multigenic family. These genes encode peptidyl arginine deiminase proteins (PADs) that are implied
in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), a systemic autoimmune
disease that primarily manifests as a chronic symmetric
polyarthritis which gradually destroys articular cartilage
and bone [18,19]. PADs transform Arginine residues into
Citrulline in a calcium-dependant manner [20]. It was
recently shown by a case-control linkage disequilibrium
study that PAD type 4 is a susceptibility locus for rheumatoid arthritis in a Japanese population [21]. These data
were not retrieved in a Caucasian population [22]. Up to
now, no phylogenomic annotation coupled with expression data of this protein family has been proposed. We
believe this analysis will shed new light on this incompletely characterized gene family.

Results
1/Phylogenetic reconstruction (See material and methods
for process)
First, we built a phylogenetic tree with full length PAD
proteins (from NCBI NR protein database) (Figure 1). We
found five paralogs of PAD proteins (types 1, 2, 3, 4, 6)
encoded by five different genes as previously described
[23]. We found PAD members in Birds (Gallus gallus),
Amphibians (Xenopus laevis) and Teleosteans (Danio
rerio). This tree supported by high bootstrap values suggested the following steps for evolution of PAD genes in
craniates: PADs' common ancestor was present as far back
as in the last common ancestor of Teleostean and Mammals. PAD-2 first diverged by duplication from the common ancestor before the radiation of mammals.

We next built a phylogeny with the same protein dataset
completed by additional proteins built from translations
of EST contigs. First, BLAST searches on EST databases
allowed us to identify other species in which PAD proteins
are likely present. We found PADs in additional Teleosteans (Fugu rubripes, Salmon, Ictularus punctatus, Onchorynchus-mykiss,
Gasterosteus
aculeatus)
and

Cephalochordates (Branchiostoma Floridae). Because ESTs
are not full length sequences, they can not be used in this
raw state to reconstruct a phylogenetic tree. To correct for
this, we built larger sequences by merging ESTs relative to
the same gene into contigs. EST contigs were translated
and included in a local database and used for phylogenetic reconstruction along with protein from NCBI NR
database. Because ESTs contigs often do not correspond to
full length transcripts, we had to build several trees with
alignment only on parts of the protein (five artificial
domains). A tree built for each domain is available in
additional file online [see additional file]. Some ESTs
could not be integrated into a contig (these ESTs are called
singletons) and were used in this state as sequence queries
to reconstruct a phylogeny. An example of a tree built with
a singleton (an Amphioxus sequence) is shown in Figure
2.
All the trees built with partial sequences were validated
only if they were in agreement with the topology of the
reference tree (Figure 1). This allowed us to classify all the
contigs and singletons into paralogy or orthology groups.
This analysis allowed us to propose a more detailed evolutionary story for the PAD genes: the common ancestor
of the PAD gene was at least present in the common ancestor of the Euchordates (Cephalochordates and Craniates)
(see tree of life in Additiona file online). It means that the
PAD gene present in Amphioxus is co-orthologous to all
PADs (as this is also the case for PAD genes in Teleostan).
Analysis of trees' topologies allowed us to conclude that
duplications of PADs certainly occurred after the speciation of craniata or more probably after the speciation of
Sarcopterygian, but before the mammals' radiation. So,
phylogenetic trees including translated EST contigs
allowed us to enlarge the dataset of species and to classify
these "new proteins" into a paralogy group.
When looking at the branches lengths, which are directly
correlated with the sequence evolution rate, it appeared
that some members of PAD genes evolved faster than the
others. Branches lengths were longer within the PAD-6
paralogy group (Homo sapiens/Mus musculus/Rattus
norvegicus PAD-6) whereas branches lengths were the
shortest within the PAD-2 paralogy group (Homo sapiens/Mus musculus/Rattus norvegicus PAD-2). It simply
means that the similarity between species is higher for
PAD-2 than it is for PAD-6. This indicates that PAD-2s'
group is the most highly conserved. Furthermore, the distance from the common ancestor is lower for PAD-2s'
group than it is for the others, suggesting that PAD-2's
group has been submitted to high negative selective pressure and has probably retained the ancestral biochemical
function.

2/Coupling expression pattern with phylogenetic
classification
The phylogenetic reconstruction allowed us to classify all
the contigs or singletons in phylogenetic groups for the
PADs phylogeny. We then developed software agents to
extract transcriptional data (pattern of tissular expression)
from the NCBI dbEST database [11]. We first normalized
expression data (relative to the number of clones in each
library), because expression data are not normalized in
NCBI dbEST. We then built a table classifying ESTs according to their position in the tree (group of paralogs,
orthologs or co-orthologs) and to the tissue in which they
are expressed. Results are illustrated in a simplified Figure
7. Raw data are in Table 2 [see Additional file]. Given the
current EST coverage, we focused on human and mouse.
The bias could occur when, say, the coverage of the
zebrafish is much lower than Human or Mouse. EST data
are all represented in the table, but statistical analysis took
into account only Human and Mouse data. For Homo
sapiens and Mus musculus, data are congruent with
expression patterns data available on UniGene [24].

Coupling phylogenetic classification with expression data
permitted us to perform updated footprints of the transcriptional pattern for each paralogs group in this multigenic family. One group of paralogs, PAD-2, showed a
broad tissular expression. As the expression pattern was
different across paralogous PAD genes, we could only
compare a few tissue types for differential levels of expression. The statistical test described by Audic and Claverie
[25] was used. Significant differences (p > 95%) were
shown in thymus, whole blood, lung, inner ear, mixed
liver and spleen library and leucocytes (see Figure 7).
3/Coupling sequence evolution rate and expression
pattern
When observing tissue distribution, we noticed that it was
conversely correlated (Correlation coefficient R = 0.76) to
sequence evolution rate (branches lengths) (see Figure 4).
This was remarkable when we compared branches lengths
and tissue distribution between PAD-2 (shortest
branches, broadest tissue distribution) and PAD-6 (longest branches, more limited tissue distribution) (see Figure
3 and Figure 4).

Discussion
1/Using phylogenomics and data from EST databases
Using EST data to complete data from protein databases is
commonly performed. Yet, if one uses only the best
BLAST hits approach to classify ESTs data, there is a large
risk of misclassification into paralogy or orthology
groups. Thus, expression data for a given paralogy group
could be undermined by the wrong assignment of EST
data into a group. In our example, we found additional
expressed sequences from Teleostean and Cephalochor-

dates in EST databases. When performing analysis with
reciprocal best BLAST hit on NR protein database; EST
from Amphioxus (cephalochordates) and Teleostean is
classified as an ortholog of PAD-2 only, but not as a coortholog of all PADs as is shown by phylogenetic analysis.
This illustrates why phylogenetic reconstruction is essential for accurate EST analysis and able to better avoid misclassification. Our approach enlarges the dataset of
homologs-containing species and robustly and accurately
classifies multigenic family members into paralogy and
orthology group. Comparison of our results to those of
Chavanas et al. [23], showed that our method allowed a
more complete reconstruction of these genes' evolutionary histories, including a broader spectrum of species
(such as cephalochordates). Our evolutionary scenario of
duplications which occurred after the radiation of mammals is consistent with the co-localization of PAD genes in
the same genomic region (1p35 in Human, chromosome

4E1 in Mus musculus and chromosome 5q36 in Rattus
norvegicus), which suggests cis-duplications.
Notice that one third of reliably-inferred alternative
mRNA isoforms are candidates for nonsense-mediated
mRNA dacay (NMD), an mRNA surveillance system [26].
These transcripts, rather than being translated into proteins, are expected to be degraded and may be subject to
regulated unproductive splicing and translation. In our
study, we did not take into account this NMD-type alternative splicing, and took all information (assembling all
exons) to reconstruct the most parsimonious story of a
gene family. however, when looking at the overall data,
we could suppose that some EST found in some tissus are
not translated into protein but are regulatory elements.
Phylogenetic trees show that some PAD family members
evolve faster than others, with the longest branches

lengths seen in the PAD-6 paralogy group and the shortest
branches lengths in the PAD-2 paralogy group. These data
suggested that PAD-2s have probably kept the ancestral
function and that other PADs may have run a neofunctionalization, still unknown. For example, the biochemical condition (Calcium concentration or pH) for enzyme
activation could be different according to each PADs.
Such an hypothesis has just been supported by
Yamamoto's group who showed small different enzymatic properties between PAD-2 and PAD-4 [27].
Any kind of expression data could be used to enhance the
accuracy of the analysis. The method used by Xun Gu et al.
and developed in Genetics [28] and PNAS [29] is particularly interesting because they used microarray data in
yeast to develop a statistical framework for studying the
evolution of genes after duplications. On the basis of a
Bayesian-based method, they reconstructed the evolutional trace of expression diversity after gene duplication.
Their conclusions are in agreement with ours, showing
that the expression of duplicate genes tends to evolve
asymmetrically, one copy maintaining the ancestral
expression profile while the others evolve rapidly.

2/When analyzing transcriptional data (Figure 7), we confirmed that transcriptional shift occurred between paralogs as previously shown [15,30]. PAD-2 shows a
widespread expression whereas PAD-6 is expressed essentially during embryonic development. PAD-3, -4 and -1
have a restricted expression pattern (respectively thymus,
eye, skin, ear and uterus for PAD-3, thymus, bone marrow, skin, breast, lung spleen, aorta and vein for PAD-4
and eye and skin for PAD-1). For orthologous genes, it is
very difficult to compare different tissues in different species because 1/analysis is never done under the same
experimental conditions and 2/one can never be sure that
tissues evolved under the same physiological conditions
in the different species.
3/Our analysis allowed us to correlate (R = 0.76) sequence
evolution rate and tissular expression distribution of paralogs (figure 3 and 4). It is interesting to notice that
shorter branches lengths are correlated with ubiquitous
tissular expression. One can hypothesize that one copy
(PAD-2) has probably kept the ancestral function, with
ubiquitous expression. Other copies may have slightly different biochemical function, and underwent shifts in their

expression pattern which is different and more limited.
These data are consistent with studies showing that housekeeping genes evolve more slowly than tissue specific
genes, and are under stronger specific constraints [31,32].
Our data suggest that the same phenomena could exist in
multigenic families but, it must be confirmed in other
examples.

Conclusion
We believe our method of adding ESTs and expression
data to phylogenetic analysis provides a new way to annotate multigenic families. More than classical phylogeny, it
allows highlighting of transcriptional shifts between paralogs. It shows that functional shifts can occur in differential tissue expression rather than in biochemical function
of the protein. It also shows a correlation between lower
sequence evolution rate (branches length) and larger tissular expression distribution. For drug development, it
points out the fact that when one analyses an orthologous
protein in a species phylogenetically close to humans, one
should keep in mind that tissular distribution of a protein
can be different between species before extrapolation of
the function to human.
This type of analysis is in its infancy and must be extended
to other multigenic families and to all kinds of expression
databases, including database where expression data are
normalized such as in UniGene, SAGE and Micro arrays.
In the future, the availability of more and more sequence
information from different species will enable tracing a
genome's evolutionary history, down to the expression
data level, with more accuracy.

Methods (cf. Figure 5)
1-Phylogenetic reconstruction with full-length proteins,
from NCBI NR database
PAD-2 was chosen as the query sequence for the first phylogenetic analysis. To build the phylogeny, the following
steps, as described elsewhere [4] were used:
BLAST
Search BLAST hits on NR protein database [10] with evalue filter set to 1e-4.
Multiple alignment
Elimination of sequences disturbing alignments and doubles. Calculation of an alignment with CLUSTALW software [33]. Elimination of large gaps. Domains searching
with HMMPFAM software [34]. Composition test for residues on Tree-Puzzle [35]. For each domain, elimination
of non-monophyletic "repeats" in a tree built with
NEIGHBOR JOINING algorithm on CLUSTALW software
[36]. Elimination of sequences with divergent residue
composition by using the amino-acid composition test
from TREE-PUZZLE software [35].

Elimination of sites not under neutrality (fast evolving
sites) by statistical methods for testing functional divergence after gene duplication [37].
Selection of congruent domains with HOMPART test
from PAUP package [38], and building of a new alignment by merging preserved parts of domains' alignments.

Tree building
From this alignment, three phylogenetic trees were generated using the following methods: Neighbor Joining [36],
Maximum Parsimony in Paup [39], Maximum Likelihood
in Puzzle [40]. By comparing topologies of these trees
with PSCORE command (Templeton winning sites test
[41,42]) from PAUP package and Kishino-Hasegawa test
[43] from TREE-PUZZLE package, production of a fusion
of these trees in a unique consensus tree according to the
results of these tests.

Comparison of this fusion tree with the NCBI tree of life,
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/taxdmp.zip,
allowed deducing paralogous and orthologous proteins,
using the algorithm described by Zmasek et al. [44]. Trees
were rooted with the midpoint method. A fusion of the
congruent three trees is noted NPL-A at the first root (for
Nj, mP, mL, with All topology congruence tests passed).
Respective bootstrap values are noted in front of each
node.
Analysis of the tree and rerooting
Our phylogenies are built with the midpoint method
rooting. In order to avoid misclassification induced by fast
evolving sites, sites which are not under neutrality are generally eliminated, using statistical methods for testing
functional divergence after gene duplication [37]. In the
phylogenetic "tree of reference", fast evolving sites could
not be removed by Gu software because not enough
sequences were present in the different paralogy groups.
So, the PAD-6 paralogy group, which evolved faster than
the others was automatically placed in out-group to equilibrate the tree. This was not necessarily reflective of the
true evolutionary history of the PAD family. Indeed, when
looking at the branches lengths between species belonging to the same paralogy group, particularly Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus and Homo sapiens, we can deduce
that duplication of the PAD ancestor occurred after the
separation of Sarcopterygii and Actinopterygian. All of the
species external to these groups in the tree of life were
placed in out-group.

Indeed, if one placed PAD-6 in the out-group, the conclusion concerning PAD' evolutionary events would change.
One would conclude that PADs duplicated before separation of Euchordates, but not after the emergence of Sarcopterigian. In this hypothesis, Cephalochordates and
Teleosteans PADs reside in the PAD-2 paralogous group.
This scheme is based on the hypothesis that PAD-6, -1, -3,
-4 were all lost during evolution in Teleosteans and
Cephalochordates. The tree built with PADI-6 in the outgroup is farless parsimonious with regards to evolutionary
events and is deducted from too many supposed gene
losses. The same conclusions could be arrived at with
other PAD groups placed in the out-group. So, a second

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/153

tree, more parsimonious regarding evolutionary events
was built with an out-group species rooting (Figure 1).
All this phylogenetic reconstructions were performed with
the FIGENIX automated platform [17].
2-Building the tree including translations of ESTs contigs
In a second step, the tree was completed with sequences
extracted from EST database.
BLAST
We first searched by BLAST request in NCBI dbEST database, sequences similar to PADs (result: 411 hits for e
value 1e-4).
Creation of a local database
These short ESTs were put in a local database. This local
database was then completed by mRNA (CDS) of completely sequenced proteins (NCBI protein db).
Contigs generation
Because ESTs are not full length mRNAs of known proteins, they cannot be included in a phylogenetic building
in this raw state. We built a specific protein database using
EST clustering. In order to reduce sequencing error, 10%
of the EST sequence length was eliminated from each tip
and only the 500 core central nucleotides were kept. Each
species' EST group was analyzed with CAP3 (ESTs clustering software) [45] to produce RNA contigs (30 contigs
constructed, 17 singletons). These RNA sequences were
translated into proteins (6 open reading frames).
Phylogenetic reconstruction
Phylogenetic reconstruction was performed with the same
method as described above. The phylogenetic analysis was
at first built with the whole PAD-2 protein as the query
sequence.

Some short sequences (not full length contigs) were eliminated during the phylogenetic process. For these
sequences, phylogenetic trees were built using five arbitrary created domains of PAD-2 (three equal sequences
and two overlapping sequences), used as the sequence
query (Figure 6).
Using this method, most of the proteins translated from
EST contigs could be analyzed and classified in a group of
paralogs. However, 15 sequences were not overlapped by
these arbitrary domains. These singletons were analyzed
as sequence query in separated phylogenies. The trees
were validated only if their topologies were similar to the
topology of the reference tree (Figure 1). As an example,
we provide a tree built with a protein from an Amphioxus
PAD EST singleton (Figure 2). EST contigs incorporated in
the trees are grouped with complete sequences (ex: contig:

14-1 in Mus musculus was close to complete PAD-3 protein of Mus musculus. It means that contig 14-1 contains
ESTs from PAD-3 protein). Five trees built with this
method are available on the supplementary material on
line.
Transcriptional pattern analysis
Phylogenetic analysis allowed classification of each EST
into a paralogy group. Information concerning tissue or
organ provenance is given for each EST in the NCBI dbEST
database [11]. We developed software "agents" in FIGENIX platform to automatically collect information corresponding to each EST. This expression information is:
ESTs content of each contigs and tissue or organ expression corresponding to each EST. These data were pooled
and classified in a summarizing table (Figure 7). For an
accurate analysis of expression, we normalized expression
data relative to the number of clones in each library
(results are given in number of hit for 1 000 000 clones).
Data were congruent with expression profile available for
Homo sapiens and Mus musculus available in UniGene
[24].
Differential expression significance and data consistency (See Figure
7 and Table 2 in supplementary material on line)
In order to compare the expression levels from EST libraries between the different paralogous copies of PAD genes,
we used the statistical test described by Audic and Claverie
[25]. For each tissue type and cell category, we compared
the EST expression data (number of hits/number of clones
in the considered library) for a given species between the
different paralogous copies of PAD genes.

When a library was shared between two paralogous copies, we directly compared the two ratios. The threshold
used for differential expression was set to p > 95% either
for under or over expression.

When several different libraries were hit by a PAD gene for
a given tissue or cell type, we first checked whether each
library was consistent with all the other ones by applying
the same statistical test [25]. When a given library was different from more than 50% of other libraries (using a
threshold of p < 60% for over or under expression), we
removed the significantly different library.
Only tissue and cells not associated with a pathological
state were considered for comparison, as expression can
be altered in cancers and other diseases. Similarly, genetically modified or selected mice variants were removed
from the comparison as they may not reflect normal
expression.
