Abstract
Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for majority of liver cancers and is the leading cause of
cancer related death in Asia. Like any other cancer, HCC develops when there is a mutation to the cellular
machinery that causes the cell to replicate at a higher rate and results in the loss of apoptosis. Therefore, a delicate
balance between the expression of various genes involved in proliferation and apoptosis decide the ultimate fate
of the cell to undergo rapid proliferation (cancer) or cell death.
Results: The benzothiazole based compounds exhibited effective cytotoxicity at 4 μM concentration and have
shown G1 cell cycle arrest with decrease in levels of G1 cell cycle proteins such as cyclin D1 and Skp2.
Involvement of tumour suppressor proteins such as PTEN and p53 was studied. Interestingly these compounds
displayed decrease in the phosphorylated forms of AKT, p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 which play a vital role in cell
proliferation. Compounds have exhibited strong and significant effect on the expression of micro RNAs such as
miR-195a & miR-101-1 which regulate hepatic cell proliferation.
Conclusions: The cell cycle arrest and apoptotic inducing nature of these compounds was revealed by FACS, BrdU
cell proliferation and tunel assays. Compounds affected both tumour suppressor proteins as well as proteins that
are involved in active cell proliferation. Micro RNAs whose target is Cyclin D1 such as miR-195a and miR-101-1 that
is required for growth of hepatoma cells was drastically affected. These compounds caused apoptosis by activating
caspase-3 and PARP.

Background
Hepato cellular carcinoma (HCC) is one among the
most prevalent and lethal cancers in humans [1] and is
the fifth leading cause of cancer across the world.
Majority of the patients with HCC do not survive
because of the frequent recurrence of tumour and
metastasis. With the recent developments in the field of
molecular oncology, researchers have focussed their

efforts towards the control of HCC [2,3]. The key signalling molecules that are frequently activated and
involved in human hepatoma are Ras, ERK (extracellular
signal regulated kinase) and AKT [4]. Phosphotidyl inositol-3-kinase (PI3K/AKT) constitute an upstream
important pathway that regulates the processes of cell
growth, metabolism, proliferation and apoptosis [5].
Mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) such as
ERK1/2, JNK (c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase), and p38
MAPK belongs to serine/threonine kinase protein family
that mediates the intracellular signals in response to various extracellular stimuli. Among these, ERK 1/2 mainly
functions in controlling cell division and is considered
to provide survival signals that can lead to rapid rate of

cell proliferation [6]. Hence inhibitors of ERK are being
explored for their anti-cancer properties.
Earlier studies have indicated that HCC may be the
cumulative result of inactivation of tumour suppressor
gene and activation of multiple oncogenes [7]. PTEN
and p53 mainly functions as tumour suppressors and
regulate the process of apoptosis [8]. Apoptosis is a programmed cell death which is characterized by events
like cytoplasmic shrinkage, chromatin condensation,
plasma membrane blebbing, exposure of phosphotidyl
serine (PS) of the cell membrane from interior to exterior [9]. Resistance to apoptosis was reported to be a significant factor for hepato-carcinogenesis [10]. Thus
compounds having apoptotic inducing nature will certainly play a crucial role in preventing the rapid cell proliferation and ultimately hepatocarcinoma.MicroRNAs
(miRNAs) are a class of phylogenetically conserved
short RNAs that suppress protein expression through
base-pairing with the 3’-untranslated region (3’-UTR) of
target mRNA. MicroRNAs are known to play important
roles in cell growth, differentiation, proliferation and
apoptosis. MiRNAs associated with tumourigenesis act
as either tumour suppressors or oncogenes [11] and are
used as potential diagnostic or therapeutic targets in
cancer treatment [12]. Although aberrant microRNA
(miRNA) expression has been observed in different
types of cancer, their pathophysiological role and their
relevance to tumourigenesis are still largely unknown.
Drastic downregulation of miR-195a, miR-101-1 has
been observed in hepatoma (metastasis) [13,14].
YM-201627 (YM), a 2-arylimidazo [2,1-b][1,3]benzothiazole derivative, was identified as an inhibitor of
VEGF-stimulated angiogenesis and is thought to play a
critical role in tumour growth and metastasis [15,16].
To increase the cytotoxicity of hepatic cancer cells we
have synthesised two analogs 3-(morpholinomethyl)-2phenyl-7-methyl-imidazo[2,1-b]benzothiazole (A3) and
3-(4-(2-pyridinyl)piperazinomethyl)-2-phenylimidazo
[2,1-b]benzothiazole (A4) (Figure 1A).
Earlier studies have demonstrated the anti-angiogenesis nature of YM compound in HUVEC cells but a
detailed study regarding the pathway has so far not been
carried out. In the present study we have focussed
mainly on the pathway targeted by benzothiazole conjugates which results in effective cytotoxicity in hepatoma
cells by modulating the expression of both oncogenic
and tumour suppressor proteins.

Figure 1 Effect of benzothiazole based compounds on cell
viability. (A) Chemical structures of YM, A3 and A4 compounds. (B)
The HepG2 cells were subjected to compound treatments YM, A3,
A4 at 4 and 8 μM concentrations for 24h. MTT assay was carried out
and the O.D a 570 nm values are recorded which represents viable
cells left over after compound treatment. Each experiment was
conducted three times. The p values are derived in compound
treated cells and are statistically significant when compared to
control untreated cells. ** indicates p < 0.05 and *** indicates p <

these compounds caused 50% cell death and upon
increase of concentration to 8 μM, we observed 25%
more increase in cell death (Figure 1B). To study the
apoptosis inducing nature of these compounds, the cells
were stained with Hoechst nuclear staining dye wherein,
apoptotic cells have shown a typical blebbing nature.
Nearly 50% cells undergo apoptosis in both A3 and A4
treated cells (Figure 2) with clear DNA fragmentation
which is the characteristic feature of apoptosis as
observed by performing Tunel assay (Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling) a common method for detecting DNA fragmentation that
results from apoptotic signalling cascades (Figure 3A).

Figure 2 Immunofluorescence studies to observe apoptotic related morphological changes in cells treated with benzothiazole based
compounds. HepG2 cells were grown in DMEM medium with 10% FBS for over night time period. Conjugates (YM, A3 and A4) were treated at
4μM for 24 h time period. YM is the standard drug. The cells were then washed, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with nuclear dye
Hoechst. The slides were then examined by fluorescence microscopy and photographed. Cells with signs of apoptosis (blebbing) were observed
in YM, A3, and A4 compound treated cells when compared with untreated cells (C). The p values are derived in compound treated cells and are

were treated with compounds YM, A3 and A4 for 24 h.
Treatment of cells with compounds A3 and A4 caused
G1 cell cycle arrest, whereas YM the standard drug has
caused G2/M cell cycle arrest. The percentage of cells in
the G1 phase was 87 and 90 in case of A3 and A4 compound treated cells respectively. YM has shown 25% cells
in G2/M phase and control untreated cells have shown
69% and 21% in G1 and G2/M phases respectively (Figure 3B). The G1 cell cycle arrest caused by A3 and A4
compounds were further confirmed by BrdU cell proliferation assay which reveals whether the cells are arrested
in G1 or progressing to S phase of cell cycle. Here the

control and YM treated cells have not shown any change
in the O.D values whereas A3 and A4 treated cells have
shown reduction, confirming the G1 phase arrest caused
by these compounds (Figure 3C).

Cyclin D1 and Skp2 are the critical regulators of G1 to

The fragmented DNA was bind to antibody conjugated to FITC. The fluorescence was detected and imaged using confocal microscope. The
results obtained were the mean of three independent experiments and were found to be statistically significant with p-value <0.001. (B) FACS
analysis was conducted after treatment of HepG2 cells with compounds YM, A3, A4 at a final concentration of 4 μM for 24 h.The standard
compound used here in this study YM. YM has shown G2/M cell cycle arrest. A3 and A4 compounds have shown clear G1 cell cycle arrest. Each
experiment was repeated three times and the results were statistically significant with p-value <0.01 for YM, <0.001 for A3 and A4. (C) The
HepG2 cells were treated with YM, A3 and A4 compounds for 24 h. The cells were subjected to BrdU incorporation where in proliferating cells
from G1 to S-phase of cell cycle accumulate more BrdU than those of G1 arrested cells. Here the BrdU antibody was added and was detected
by secondary HRP antibody. O.D at 450 nm will give the amount of BrdU incorporated. The p values are derived in compound treated cells
when compared to control cells and are statistically significant with the p-value of <0.01 for A3 and <0.001 for A4.

Figure 4 Effect of benzothiazole based compounds on cell cycle regulatory proteins Cyclin D1, Skp2 in HepG2 cells. HepG2 cells treated
at 80% confluency with YM, A3 and A4 at 4 μM concentration for 24 h. The total cell lysates were isolated and analysed by immunoblotting
with anti-CyclinD1, anti-Skp2. YM is the positive control. b-actin was used as loading control. Western blots were representative of three
independent experiments. C represents control untreated cells. The molecular weight of CyclinD1 and Skp2 were 35, 47 KDa. Each experiment
was repeated three times and densitometric analysis was done. Results were statistically significant with p-value <0.001 for A3 and A4 when
compared to control.

to western blot analysis using antibodies against Cyclin
D1 and Skp2. A drastic reduction in the protein levels
of Cyclin D1 and Skp2 in A3 and A4 treated cells compared to untreated control but not in YM indicated the
occurrence of G1 cell cycle arrest (Figure 4).
Benzothiazole based compounds activate tumour
suppressor proteins p53 and PTEN

P53 and PTEN are tumour suppressor proteins that
control the apoptotic event. p53 function is crucial in

multicellular organisms, where it regulates cell cycle and
thus functions as a tumour suppressor that is involved
in preventing cancer. PTEN is one of the most commonly lost tumour suppressors in human cancer. In
order to understand the effect of these compounds on
tumour suppressor proteins HepG2 cells were treated
with compounds YM, A3 and A4 for 24 h and cell
lysates were subjected to western analysis. An increase
in the expression of both these proteins was seen upon
treatment of the compounds (YM, A3 and A4) in comparison to control untreated cells indicating an effect in
the upregulation of both the genes.
Apart from acting as tumour suppressor, PTEN can
negatively regulate the activity of AKT through its lipid
phosphatase function by dephosphorylating AKT at Ser473
[17]. As expected there was a significant reduction in the
levels of phosphorlyated form of AKT (ser 473) in YM, A3
and A4 compound treated cells compared to untreated
control cells. The expression of PTEN was further confirmed by carrying out immunofluoresence experiment in
A4 (the effective compound) treated cells along with
untreated control using PTEN antibody. A clear increase in
the amount of fluorescence produced by staining with
PTEN antibody in compound treated cells compared to
untreated controls was observed (Figure 5 &6).
Effect of Benzothiazole based compounds on Ras and
MAP Kinase family proteins

Figure 6 Immunofluorescence based studies of PTEN after
treatment with benzothiazole based compounds. HepG2 cells
were grown in 10% FBS containing medium in coverslips and
treated with 4 μM of effective benzothiazole compound (A4). Cells
were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence study as
described in material and methods. Images were captured in
confocal microscopy. The pattern of staining was also recorded.
Control: represents untreated cells.

The activation of Ras is the first and foremost event in
HCC [18] whose activation is known to regulate cell
cycle progression through its interference with cyclins
and cell cycle inhibitors. [19]. MAP kinase proteins constitute a serine threonine kinase protein family that
decide the fate of cells either towards proliferation or
differentiation [20,21]. Thus we checked the expression
of k-Ras and p38 MAPK in untreated and compound

Figure 5 Western blot analysis of tumour suppressor proteins (p53, PTEN) and PTEN dependent Akt phosphorylation in benzothiazole
based compound treated cells. HepG2 cells were treated with benzothiazole based compounds for 24 h and cell lysates were subjected to
western blot analysis using antibodies specific to p53, PTEN and Akt Ser 473. b-actin was used as loading control. The molecular weights of p53,
PTEN and Akt ser 473 are 53, 47 and 65 KDa. The western blot experiments were repeated three times and densitometric analysis was carried
out. The results were statistically significant with p-value <0.001 for A3 and A4 when compared to control.

(YM, A3 and A4) treated cells. Total RNA was isolated
and RT-PCR was carried out using primers against Ras
and p38MAPK genes. Drastic decrease in Ras mRNA
level with no change in the levels of MAP Kinase transcript was observed in compound treated cells in comparison with untreated control cells (Figure 7).
Previous studies have shown that proteins of MAPK
family such as ERK1/2 and p38MAPK get activated
upon phosphorylation and are responsible for rapid cell
proliferation [22]. Therefore, we also quantitated the
protein levels of p38 MAPK, ERK1/2 as well their active
forms (i.e phosphorylated forms). Interestingly no
change in the levels of MAPK and ERK1/2 was observed
while the active phosphorylated forms were decreased
revealing that these compounds have an inhibitory role
on cell proliferation (Figure 8).
Cytotoxicity induced by benzothiazole based compounds

The process of apoptosis is controlled by a diverse range
of cell signals, which may originate either extracellularly

(extrinsic) or intracellularly (intrinsic). To understand
the mechanism underlying cell death we first studied
the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. HepG2 cells were
treated with YM, A3 and A4 compounds at 4μM concentration for 24 h. Total cell lysates were obtained and
western blot analysis was carried out using antibodies
against active caspase-3 and cleaved PARP. An increased
level of expression of both active caspase -3 and cleaved
PARP in case of YM, A3 and A4 treated cells indicated
the role of mitochondria in this apoptotic event via
intrinsic pathway (Figure 9).
Effect of benzothaizole based compounds on miR-195a
and miR-101-1

Growing evidence indicate that deregulation of a class of
non coding RNAs termed as microRNAs (miRNAs) contribute to tumourigenesis. Inhibition or alteration of
miRNA expression in cancer cells impacts gene expression and affects cell proliferation and survival. Altered
expression of miRNAs such as miR-101-1, miR-122a,

compounds (YM, A3 and A4) at a final concentration of 4 μM for 24 h. After treatment total RNA was isolated and RT-PCR was conducted. The
PCR products were separated on 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized under U.V. light. GAPDH was used as loading control. Each
experiment was repeated three times. The gel pictures here were representative of three independent experiments and densitometric analysis
was done. The results were found to be statistically significant when compared to control (p-value<0.001).

S phase transition, while ectopic expression of miR-101
dramatically suppressed the ability of hepatoma cells to
form colonies [13,14]. Since both the compounds (A3,
A4) have exhibited G1 cell cycle arrest, we were interested to check the expression of miR-195a and miR101-1in the compound treated cells when compared to
untreated control cells. HepG2 cells were treated with
compounds A3 and A4 for 24 h at 4 μM concentration.
The expression pattern of both the miRNAs was studied
by Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) analysis using
specific primers. Surprisingly a 2- fold increase in the
level of miR-101-1 and 5- fold increase in the level of
miR-195a were observed in the case of effective (A4)
compound treated cells when compared to untreated
control cells. An almost similar result was observed in
case of A3 treated cells. These results clearly show the
regulatory role of benzothiazole compounds on cell
cycle and apoptosis by modulating the non-coding
RNAs that eventually lead to cell death (Figure 10).
Figure 8 Effect of benzothiazole based compounds on ERK and
MAPK proteins that play vital role in cell proliferation. HepG2
cells were treated with compounds YM, A3 and A4 for 24 h. The
total lysates were harvested and analysed by immunoblotting with
anti-ERK, phosphorylated ERK (Thr 202/Tyr 204), anti-p38 MAPK,
phosphorylated form of p38 MAPK (Thr 180/Tyr 182) anti- bodies.
YM serves as positive control. b - actin was used as loading control.
Western blots were representative of three independent
experiments. The expression of phosphorylated ERK and MAPK were
found to be down regulated. C: represents control untreated cells.
The molecular weights of ERK1/2, Phospho ERK1/2, p38MAPK and
phosphop38MAPK were 42/44 KDa, 42/44KDa, 43 KDa and 43 KDa
respectively. The western blot analysis was repeated thrice and
densitometric analysis was done. The results were statistically
significant with p < 0.001 for A3 and A4 with regard to ERK1/2
phosphorylation and p < 0.05, p < 0.001 for p38 MAPK
phosphorylation for A3 and A4 respectively.

miR-195, miR-21, miR-214, miR-373, miR-22, miR-221,
miR-223 and miR-224 were observed in hepatocarcinoma. Recent studies have highlighted the importance
of miR-195 that target cyclin D1 which regulate the G1-

Discussion
Liver cancer is fatal and occurs commonly in Asian
countries [23]. Hepato cellular carcinoma is characterised by rapid growth rate, strong malignancy, easy
invasion, metastasis and poor prognosis. The development of chemotherapeutic agents that cause apoptosis
and reduce mortality have been increasingly appreciated
as ideal compounds for management of this cancer [24].
We have synthesised analogs of benzothiazoles (A3, A4)
and carried out detailed biological study in order to
understand the key signalling molecules that are affected
and are responsible for the cytotoxic nature. In the present study benzothiazole conjuagates (A3 & A4) have
shown profound cytotoxicity (50% of cell death) at 4μM
concentration as observed by MTT based cell viability
assay. The apoptosis inducing nature of the compounds
was clearly demonstrated by Hoechst nuclear staining as
well as tunnel assay which revealed blebbing and DNA
fragmentation that occurred during cell death. The

cleaved PARP. YM is the positive control. b-actin was used as loading control. The results obtained were from three independent experiments
and are statistically significant at p < 0.001 for compound A4.

Figure 10 Effect of benzothiazole based compounds on microRNAs miR-195a, miR-101-1. The HepG2 cells were treated with compounds
A3 and A4 at 4 μM concentration. Total RNA was isolated and the RNA was poly A tailed using Poly A polymerase and were subjected micro
RNA specific RT-PCR study. Equal mRNA was used for the study. Each experiment was repeated three times. The results obtained were from
three independent experiments and are statistically significant at p < 0.001 for compound A4.

FACS analysis of A3 and A4 compound treated cells
indicated G1 cell cycle arrest nature which was further
confirmed by BrdU cell proliferation assay. The G1 to S
phase transition of cell cycle is mainly controlled by
proteins such as Cyclin D1 and Skp2. Perturbations in
Cyclin D1 and its impact on hepatocarcinoma has been
widely observed in 30 different hepatoma types [25].
Where as Skp2 plays a prominent role in the process of
degradation of the tumour suppressor proteins such as
Foxo that controls the G1 to S phase transition. In our
study we found drastic down regulation of Cyclin
D1and Skp2 proteins after compound treatment there
by revealing G1 cell cycle arrest nature of the benzothiazole based compounds (Figure 4).
It has been reported that hepato-cellular carcinoma is
the final event of inactivation of tumour suppressor
genes such as PTEN and p53 that controls cell proliferation and death [7,8]. Upon compound treatment upregulation of PTEN and p53 protein levels was observed
by western analysis. This data has been further supported by the fact that increased p53 level resulted in
increased binding of p53 to PTEN promoter and controls both the transcriptional and translational regulation of PTEN gene which aids in increased rate of
apoptosis [26].
Increased PTEN, apart from acting as tumour suppressor negatively regulates AKT activity (i.e AKT phosphorylation) and cause apoptosis [27]. Moreover AKT
physically associates with MDM2 and phosphorylates at
serine residue which helps in nuclear translocation
thereby causing degradation of p53 [28]. In the present
study we observed increased PTEN which causes
decreased AKT activity (phosphorylation) and finally
leading to p53 activation. Another important protein
family that plays a major role in the formation, migration, invasion and maintainence of hepatocarcinoma is
MAPK protein family. Mitogen activated protein kinase

(MAPK) family members such as MAPK and ERK1/2
are important proteins that functions as intracellular signal transducers which enter into the nucleus upon phosphorylation [22] and induce genes involved in the
process of proliferation and differentiation [22] &[21].
Interestingly treatment of HepG2 cells with the compounds (A3 & A4) resulted in the decrease of phosphorylated forms of P38 MAPK and ERK1/2 proteins
thus controlling active cell proliferation.
Recent studies have indicated that micro RNAs are
directly involved in many different kinds of cancers such
as lung, breast, brain, liver, colon and leukemia. More
than 50% of miRNA genes are located in cancer associated genomic regions or in the fragile sites suggesting
that miRNAs may play a vital role in the pathogenesis
of human cancers [29]. Interestingly degradation of
microRNAs has been frequently observed in tumour tissues [30,31]. In 80-90% of hepato cellular carcinoma
(HCC) cases microRNAs such as miR-195 and miR-1011 were found to be down regulated. Ectopic expression
studies of miR-195 caused G1/S phase block by targeting cyclin D1 [13] whereas miR-101-1 dramatically suppresses the ability of hepatoma cells to form colonies
and develop tumours [14]. Upon compound treatment
(A3 and A4) the expression of miRNAs (miR-195, miR101-1) was significantly increased and thus has potential
implication in the treatment of hepatoma. Previous studies [32-34] have shown the role of caspase-3 and cleavage of PARP in the process of apoptosis. The
benzothiazole compounds in the present study have also
shown the involvement of mitochondria through the
activation of caspase-3 and PARP proteins.

Conclusions
Benzothiazole based compounds (A3, A4) exhibited high
cytotoxic activity as observed from the MTT studies.
Cell cycle analysis has shown the G1 cell cycle arrest

nature of the compounds and was further confirmed by
BrdU cell proliferation assay. Our compounds A3 and
A4 regulate cell cycle by affecting cyclin D1 and Skp2
that play a vital in controlling G1-S phase of cell cycle.
The balance between genes involved in cell proliferation
and tumour suppression regulate the events of tumourigenesis or apoptosis. Compound treated cells have
exhibited increased levels of tumour suppressor proteins
PTEN and p53. The phosphorylated (active) forms of
ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK protein levels were decreased in
compound treated cells which led to control of cell proliferation. The levels of microRNAs such as miR-195a,
miR-101-1 were elevated in A3 and A4 compound treated cells compared to control untreated cells. These
compounds caused cell death involving mitochondria as
the major organelle with the activation of active caspase-3 and PARP proteins. Thus these benzothiazole
based conjugates have potential implications in control
of hepato-cellular carcinoma.

Methods
Cell culture

Human hepato-carcinoma cell line HepG2 purchased
from American Type culture collection was maintained
in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen), supplemented with 2 mM glutamax (Invitrogen), 10% fetal calf serum and 100 U/ml Pencillin and
100 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate (Sigma). The cell line
was maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere
containing 5% CO2 in the incubator.

washed with PBS and incubated with 1 mg/ml RNase A
solution (Sigma) at 37°C for 30 min. Cells were collected
by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 5 min and further
stained with 250 mL of DNA staining solution [10 mg
of Propidium Iodide (PI), 0.1 mg of trisodium citrate,
and 0.03 mL of Triton X-100 were dissolved in 100 mL
of sterile MilliQ water at room temperature for 30 min
in the dark]. The DNA contents of 20,000 events were
measured by flow cytometer (DAKO CYTOMATION,
Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). Histograms were analyzed
using Summit Software.
Tunel assay

Tunel assay was conducted by using the Apoalert DNA
fragmentation Assay kit (Clone tech) according to manufacturer instructions. This kit detects the apoptosisinduced nuclear DNA fragmentation that is based on
fluorescence. The assay is based on the principle of
terminal deoxy nucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated
dUTP nick-end-labelling (i.e TUNEL). TdT catalyzes
incorporation of fluorescein-dUTP at the free 3’-hydroxyl ends of fragmented DNA. Flourescein-labeled DNA
can be detected via confocal microscopy.
BrdU Cell Proliferation Assay

Cell viability was assessed by MTT assay, a mitochondrial function assay. It is based on the ability of viable
cells to reduce the MTT to insoluble formazan crystals
by mitochondrial dehydrogenase. HepG2 cells were
seeded in a 96-well plate at a density of 10,000 cells/
well. After overnight incubation, cells were treated with
compounds YM, A3 and A4 at 4 and 8 mM concentration and incubated for 24 h. Medium was then discarded and replaced with 10 μL MTT dye. Plates were
incubated at 37°C for 2 h. The resulting formazan crystals were solubilized in 100 μL extraction buffer. The
optical density (O.D) was read at 570 nm with micro
plate reader (Multi-mode Varioskan instrument-Themo
Scientific).

This assay was carried out by using the 5-Bromo 2deoxyuridine (BrdU) cell proliferation assay kit (Millipore) to assess the effect of YM, A3 and A4 compounds
on the proliferation of HepG2 cells. 1 × 104cells were
seeded and allowed to grow for 24 h. BrdU was added
and allowed to incorporate for 5 h followed by the addition of test compound (YM, A3 & A4) at concentration
of 4 μM for 24 h. Fixation was done for 30 min at room
temperature. The cells were then washed, anti-BrdU
antibody was added which binds to BrdU that was
incorporated in the cell. After 1 h incubation, 100 μl
anti-BrdU goat anti-mouse horse raddish peroxidise
(HRP)- conjugated secondary antibody (1:2000) was
added and incubated for 30min. Washing procedures
were followed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. TMB substrate (100 μl) was added, incubated for
another 30min at room temperature and O.D values
were taken at a wave length of 450nm. Lower O.D
values reflect lower BrdU concentrations in the sample
and thus an indirect depiction of a low cell proliferation
rate.

Cell Cycle Analysis

Immunofluorescence

5 × 105 HepG2 cells were seeded in 60 mm dish and
were allowed to grow for 24 h. Compounds A3, A4 and
YM were added at a final concentration of 4μM to the
culture media, and the cells were incubated for an additional 24 h. Cells were harvested with Trypsin-EDTA,
fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol at 4°C for 30 min,

Human hepato-carcinoma HepG2 cells were seeded on
cover slips and treated with benzo-thiazole based compounds at concentration of 4 μM for 24h. After treatment, cover slips were fixed with a paraformaldehyde
solution (4% in 1× PBS) for 20 min at room temperature. Cell permeabilization was achieved by

MTT assay

administration of a Triton X-100 solution (0.2% in 1×
PBS) for 5min. Further the cover slips were kept overnight in 100% methanol at 4°C. Subsequently, cover
slips were blocked with a 1% BSA solution for 60min
and then incubated with anti PTEN (1:100) antibody at
room temperature for 2h. The slides were washed three
times each of 5min with PBST. Then cover slips were
incubated with a FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary
antibody (Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories Inc.,
Pennsylvania, USA) for one hour and cover slips were
washed three times with PBST solution and mounted
with DAPI/PI solution. Finally, cells were observed
under confocal microscope (Olympus FV1000). Images
taken were processed with the support of the flow view
version 1.7 c software program.
Protein extraction and Western blot analysis

Total cell lysates from cultured HepG2 cells were
obtained by lysing the cells in ice-cold RIPA buffer
(1XPBS, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate and 0.1%
SDS) and containing 100 mg/mL PMSF, 5 mg/mL
Aprotinin, 5 mg/mL leupeptin, 5 mg/mL pepstatin and
100 mg/mL NaF. After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for
10 min, the protein in supernatant was quantified by
Bradford method (BIO-RAD) using Multimode Varioskan instrument (Thermo-Fischer Scientifics). Fifty
micrograms of protein per lane was applied in 12%
SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the protein was transferred to polyvinylidine difluoride (PVDF)
membrane (GE Biosciences). The membrane was
blocked at room temperature for 2 h in TBS + 0.1%
Tween20 (TBST) containing 5% blocking powder (Santacruz). The membrane was washed with TBST for 5
min, primary antibody was added and incubated at 4°C
overnight (O/N). ERK 1/2, ERK Phos (Thr 202/Tyr
204), Phos p38 (Thr 180/Tyr 182), P38MAPK, active
caspase-3 and Cleaved PARP antibodies were purchased
from Cell Signalling, USA. P53 and Cyclin D1antibodies
were purchased from Santa Cruz, PTEN and Skp2 antibodies were purchased from Abbiotec Company. Akt
Ser 473 antibody was purchased from (Millipore). The
membrane was incubated with corresponding horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (1:2000)
(Santa Cruz) at room temperature for 1h. Membranes
were washed with TBST three times for 15 min and the
blots were visualized with chemiluminescence reagent
(Thermo Fischer Scientifics Ltd.). The X-ray films were
developed with developer and fixed with fixer solution.

Hoechst. Nuclear morphology of the cells was observed
under confocal microscope.
Semi-quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR (RT-PCR)

Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, USA) and reverse transcribed into cDNA using
superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen life technologies). The PCR was carried out with specific primers such as K-Ras, MAPK (Table 1) in Takara
Bioscience PCR machine. The products were electrophoresed on agarose gel (1%) followed by staining with
ethidium bromide and visualized under U.V. light. The
signal intensity of respective bands was measured by
means of the quantity one version 4.1.1 soft ware using
BIORAD image analysis system (CA, USA).
MicroRNA Expression profiling

Total RNA was isolated from control and compound
(A3 and A4) treated cells. Equal amount of DNase-treated RNA was Poly A tailed using Poly A Polymerase
and oligo dT adapter was used to synthesise the cDNA.
RT-PCR reaction was set up using universal reverse primer and miRNA specific forward primer. The temperature conditions are 50°C for 2min, 95°C 10min, followed
by 40 cycles of (95°C 15sec, 60°C 1min).
Statistical Analysis

Statistical Analysis was performed using the graph pad
software to evaluate the significant difference between
the control and treated samples. All variables were
tested in three independent experiments. The results
were reported as mean ± SD. * indicates p < 0.05, **
indicates p < 0.01 and *** indicates p < 0.001.
