among the native rats of Australia

Abstract
Background: The genus Rattus is highly speciose and has a complex taxonomy that is not fully resolved. As
shown previously there are two major groups within the genus, an Asian and an Australo-Papuan group. This
study focuses on the Australo-Papuan group and particularly on the Australian rats. There are uncertainties
regarding the number of species within the group and the relationships among them. We analysed 16
mitochondrial genomes, including seven novel genomes from six species, to help elucidate the evolutionary
history of the Australian rats. We also demonstrate, from a larger dataset, the usefulness of short regions of the
mitochondrial genome in identifying these rats at the species level.
Results: Analyses of 16 mitochondrial genomes representing species sampled from Australo-Papuan and Asian
clades of Rattus indicate divergence of these two groups ~2.7 million years ago (Mya). Subsequent diversification
of at least 4 lineages within the Australo-Papuan clade was rapid and occurred over the period from ~ 0.9-1.7 Mya,
a finding that explains the difficulty in resolving some relationships within this clade. Phylogenetic analyses of our
126 taxon, but shorter sequence (1952 nucleotides long), Rattus database generally give well supported species
clades.
Conclusions: Our whole mitochondrial genome analyses are concordant with a taxonomic division that places the
native Australian rats into the Rattus fuscipes species group. We suggest the following order of divergence of the
Australian species. R. fuscipes is the oldest lineage among the Australian rats and is not part of a New Guinean
radiation. R. lutreolus is also within this Australian clade and shallower than R. tunneyi while the R. sordidus group is
the shallowest lineage in the clade. The divergences within the R. sordidus and R. leucopus lineages occurring
about half a million years ago support the hypotheses of more recent interchanges of rats between Australia and
New Guinea. While problematic for inference of deeper divergences, we report that the analysis of shorter
mitochondrial sequences is very useful for species identification in rats.

Background
Rattus is the most speciose genus among mammals with
some 66 described species [1]. The genus is thought to
have originated in the general region of the Indonesian
Islands with subsequent dispersal into continental Asia,
New Guinea and Australia [2]. Over the last five million
years (My) a combination of tectonic and climatic
change meant that this geographic region experienced
major fluctuations in sea level and in the extent of

emergent land mass [3]. These changes provided opportunities for dispersal and speciation within Rattus.
Previous studies [4,5] based on mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA) identified two major groups within Rattus.
These are the Asian group, comprising rats from Southeast Asia and Island Southeast Asia, and the AustraloPapuan group comprising rats from Australia and New
Guinea. The Asian group includes the three most widely
distributed rat species, Rattus rattus and Rattus norvegicus which were dispersed around the world via European sailing ships [6] and Rattus exulans which was
transported throughout the Pacific by prehistoric peoples [7]. The Australo-Papuan group of rats are largely
restricted to Australia and New Guinea with the

exception of Rattus praetor that also occurs in the Solomon Islands in addition to New Guinea. In addition
subfossil remains of this rat have been found at archaeological sites as far east as Fiji indicating that prehistoric
peoples in all likelihood transported it into the Pacific
[8]. While the Robins et al. [4] study shows good species
resolution among the rats of Australia the deeper relationships were not well resolved. The focus of this
investigation is to use mtDNA, including whole mitochondrial genomes, to help evaluate these evolutionary
relationships and to date the divergences among the
Rattus species of Australia.
Rattus has been included in other recent molecular
phylogenetic analyses. Jansa et al. [9] investigated relationships among endemic rodents in the Philippine
Islands, using single nuclear (exon 1 of IRBP) and mitochondrial (cytochrome b (cyt b)) markers, but they
included only one species from the Australo-Papuan
group. Rowe et al. [10] sampled broadly among the
genera of murine rodents with the aim of inferring relationships among the “Old Endemics” of the AustraloPapuan, or Sahul, region. Their use of six nuclear (exon
10 of GHR, exon 11 of BRCA1, the single large exon of
RAG1, intron 3 and flanking regions of BDR, exon 1 of
IRBP and intron 2 and flanking regions of ATP5) and
six mitochondrial markers (the genes cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI), cytochrome c oxidase subunit II
(COII), ATPase 8 and cyt b, plus the two tRNA’s
between COI and ATPase 8) enabled the resolution of
deep divergences but their inclusion of only three Rattus
species means that there is little overlap with our study.
Most recently Pagès et al. [11] developed a large dataset
of Rattus and related species based on one nuclear
(exon 1 of IRBP) and two mitochondrial markers (cyt b
and COI). That study, however, focussed on the species
found in Southeast Asia and did not include any of the
species endemic to the Australo-Papuan region.
There has been considerable debate regarding the
number of rat species in Australia and New Guinea and
the relationships among them. Taylor and Horner [12]
revised the systematics of the native Australian rats and
recognized five species R. fuscipes, R. leucopus, R. lutreolus, R. sordidus and R. tunneyi. Based on a multivariate
analysis of craniometric data Taylor et al. [13] included
R. fuscipes and R. leucopus within a clade containing
New Guinean native rat species whereas the other
Australian native rat species (R. sordidus, R. tunneyi and
R. lutreolus) formed a separate but deeper clade. A phylogeny based on isozyme electrophoresis of 55 loci of
the Australian Rattus species, together with R. norvegicus and R. rattus as outgroups, [14] showed similarities
with the phenogram of Taylor et al. [13] with R. lutreolus diverging early, followed by R. tunneyi and lastly a
more recent divergence of a clade containing R.

sordidus, Rattus colletti and R. villosissimus. This study
was unable to resolve the deeper relationships among R.
fuscipes, R. lutreolus and R. leucopus and since it did not
include rats from New Guinea it could not address the
relationship between R. fuscipes and the New Guinean
rats.
In the recent taxonomic study by Musser and Carleton [1] the rats of Australia and New Guinea are divided
into two groups. The Rattus fuscipes species group comprises four of the five Australian native rats described by
Taylor and Horner [12] while the fifth, R. leucopus, is
placed among the New Guinean species in the Rattus
leucopus species group. Musser and Carleton [1] and
Baverstock et al. [14] give R. colletti and R. villosissimus
full species status whereas Taylor and Horner had classified them both as sub-species of R. sordidus. The Rattus leucopus species group of Musser and Carleton [1]
comprises the 14 species; Rattus arfakiensis, Rattus arrogans, Rattus giluwensis, Rattus jobiensis, R. leucopus,
Rattus mordax, Rattus niobe, Rattus novaeguineae, Rattus omichlodes, R. praetor, Rattus richardsoni, Rattus
steini, Rattus vandeuseni and Rattus verecundus. Of the
Australian and New Guinean species, only two are
known to occur in both regions and the results of the
craniometric study of Taylor et al. [13] strongly supported the hypothesis of Tate [15,16] that R. sordidus
colonised southern and south-eastern New Guinea from
Australia, and R. leucopus colonised Cape York in
north-eastern Australia from New Guinea. The presence
of ephemeral land bridges between Australia and New
Guinea, especially in the area of the Torres Strait, is
believed to be associated with glaciation cycles during
the last 2.6 - 3 million years and would have provided
opportunities for such faunal interchange [17,18]. Aplin
(quoted by Musser and Carleton [1] pg 1462), suggested
on the basis of preliminary cyt b data that “members of
the R. fuscipes and the R. leucopus groups each may
represent discrete radiations, albeit closely related and
with some exchange across the Torres strait.” Aplin’s
[17] schematic phylogeny, although it included some
New Guinean Rattus species, was similar to that of
Baverstock et al. [14]. Aplin placed R. lutreolus basal in
the clade containing R. tunneyi, R. sordidus, R. colletti
and R. villosissimus and did not resolve the position of
R. fuscipes. He stated that although both positions were
uncertain R. fuscipes was probably more closely related
to the New Guinean rat cluster and R. lutreolus to the
Australian rat cluster. It is thus fair to say that there is a
need for further clarification of the relationships within
this speciose group.
In an earlier study Robins et al. [4] used three mitochondrial regions (D-loop, cyt b and COI) to identify
Rattus species. Several well-defined clades were recovered. In many cases these corresponded to named

Robins et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:375

species, that is all members of the clade had the same
species label assigned at source by either the collector
or the museum. In some cases, clades contained multiple species labels, possibly resulting from misidentification, faulty taxonomy or biological processes such as
introgression. All 16 clades were assigned a name, as
shown in Figure two of Robins et al. [4], effectively making them operational taxonomic units (OTUs) although
10 of these names corresponded well to a species. These
OTUs are also used in this paper.
From the sample base of the OTUs in Robins et al. [4]
six rats were chosen for whole mitochondrial genome
analysis and together with data from GenBank divergence times and relationships among five Rattus species
were inferred [5]. That 2008 study, however, included
only one rat species from the Australo-Papuan region.
To increase our understanding of the relationships
among the rats of this region we sequenced seven whole
mitochondrial genomes from six Rattus species from the
Australo-Papuan clade; R. fuscipes, R. lutreolus, R. sordidus, R. tunneyi, R. villosissimus and two samples of R.
leucopus (one originating from Australia and one from
New Guinea). We have again chosen rats from the sample base of Robins et al. [4] except for the more recently
acquired samples of R. lutreolus and R. villosissimus. We
have sequenced whole mitochondrial genomes from
four species unique to Australia and two occurring in
both Australia and New Guinea. We used these data
together with data from GenBank to estimate divergence
times and to examine the evolutionary relationships
among the Australian rats. We have compared the phylogenies inferred from whole mitochondrial genomes
(n = 16) with those obtained by analysing the hypervariable region of the D-Loop together with two mitochondrial gene regions (cyt b and COI) from the same
sample set and also from a much larger sample set (n =
126). Here we show that the use of this subset of the
mitochondrial genome, while generally reliable for species identification is inadequate for dating or resolving
deeper relationships. Our analyses of 16 whole mitochondrial genomes, on the other hand, have made a
substantial contribution to our understanding of the
relationships among the Australo-Papuan Rattus species
and the timing of their divergences.

Methods
Whole mitochondrial genomes were obtained from
seven rats representing six different species (see sample
details in Table 1). The species were R. fuscipes, R. leucopus, R. lutreolus, R. sordidus, R. tunneyi, and R. villosissimus. Two specimens of R. leucopus (one from New
Guinea and the other from Australia) were processed
because this species occurs in both New Guinea and in
the Cape York region of Australia. These seven novel

Page 3 of 16

genomes were compared with other available whole
mitochondrial genomes from wild caught rats. There are
a number of mitochondrial genomes available from
highly inbred strains of R. norvegicus (e.g., 10 of the 12
genomes from Schlick et al. [19]) which we did not
include in the analysis. DNA was extracted from an
additional two samples of R. lutreolus and three samples
of R. villosissimus (see sample details in Table 2). Three
mitochondrial regions were sequenced from these samples (750 bp of COI, 762 bp of cyt b and 585 bp of Dloop) and analysed together with the dataset from
Robins et al. [4].
DNA was extracted from liver or muscle tissue using
the High Pure PCR Template Preparation Kit (Roche).
Mitochondrial DNA was amplified in four overlapping
long range pieces from 4 to 6 kb in length. See Table 3
for amplicon length and primer details. Long range PCR
was performed using the DNA polymerase Taq and protocols of the Expand Long Template PCR System
(Roche). For short-range PCR the amplification reactions contained: TrisHCl pH 8.3 10 mM; KCl 50 mM;
forward and reverse primers at 0.5 μM each; dNTPs at
0.15 mM each; 0.5 U of Taq polymerase; 1 μL of DNA
template. We used a standard 3-step amplification protocol: 94°C, 3 min, 35 cycles of: 94°C, 30 s, 60°C, 30 s,
72°C, 1 min followed by 1 cycle of 72°C, 5 min and a
hold at 15°C. PCR products were visualized and quantified on ethidium bromide stained 1% agarose gels using
a low mass ladder from Invitrogen for comparison and
purified using either ExoSAP-IT™ from USB Corporation
or band cut and column cleaned using the QIAquick
Gel Extraction Kit™ from QIAGEN.
All sequencing was done by The Allan Wilson Centre
Genome Service at Massey University, Palmerston
North, New Zealand. The long range products from
each sample except R. fuscipes which was sequenced as
part of a separate experiment, described in McComish
et al. [20] were pooled and processed for sequencing
using the multiplexed sequencing kit from Illumina. A
75-bp single read run was performed on an Illumina
Genome Analyser GAII (Illumina, Inc.) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. After sequencing, the resultant images were analysed with the proprietary Illumina
pipeline (version 1.4). This resulted in approximately
964 Mb of sequence, with 90% of clusters passing the
initial filtering step. Reads for each sample were
trimmed at the 3’ end by 5, 10, 15 and 20 bases. Assemblies were made using Velvet 0.7 [21] with a range of
hash lengths from 33 to 63 and a minimum k-mer coverage of 5×. Maximum contig lengths and N50 values
were tabulated, and the best assembly for each sample
was selected for further analysis. Assembled contigs
were aligned to the R. praetor mitochondrial genome
using Geneious 4.7 [22].

Sanger sequencing was used to sequence both ends of
each long range fragment to check consistency and to
complete the coverage of the mitochondrial genomes. It
was also used to sequence the three mitochondrial
regions of the additional samples of R. lutreolus and
R. villosissimus. Sanger sequencing was carried out using
the BigDye Terminator version 3 sequencing kit, the
GeneAmp PCR System 9700 and a capillary ABI3730
DNA Analyser, all from Applied Biosystems. The final
assembly of each mitochondrial genome was carried out
in Sequencher™ (Gene Codes Corporation).
Sequence Alignments

Three main datasets were assembled. The whole genome (WG) dataset (for the alignment see Additional File
1) contained mitochondrial DNA sequences from the
genomes of 13 species and included the vole (Cricetidae)
and mouse (Muridae) as outgroups (Table 1). The dataset includes 12 mitochondrial genome proteins, rRNA
and tRNA coding sequences, totalling 14,471 nucleotides
after manual alignment. The D-loop was excluded

because of difficulty in alignment. The sequence for protein coding gene ND6 was also excluded because it is
encoded on the mitochondrial L-strand. The sequence
alignment was partitioned into the three codon positions, RNA stem regions and RNA loop regions. As in
the previous work of Robins et al. [5], the third codon
positions were coded as purines or pyrimidines (RYcoded) because it was demonstrated there that these
positions had a higher substitution rate than the other
partitions and substitution models did not sufficiently
account for saturation at these sites at deeper levels in
the tree. RY-coding greatly reduced saturation in 3 rd
codon transitions, removed highly significant composition bias and provided better phylogenetic resolution,
even within Rattus [5]. Compositional heterogeneity is a
recognised problem in mitochondrial genome analysis
and for a more detailed discussion of the issues see [23]
and other references therein.
A second alignment was assembled from three genomic regions (3G), comprising 126 sequences, spanning
672 bp of cyt b, 702 bp of the COI and the

RY-encoded data. Consequently we created four alignments. The first used the complete alignment from
Additional File 6 (1-1182 bases), and the second used a
short alignment (bases 1-713). In the third and fourth
alignments the data from both the complete and the
short alignment were partitioned into codon positions 1
+2 (unencoded) and codon position 3 (coded as RY).
These codon-partitioned alignments were trimmed by
40 bases at the 3’ end to remove the non-coding tRNA
region from the sequences leaving bases 41-1182 and 41

hypervariable region of the D-loop, for a total length of
1952 bp. This dataset which includes Mus as the outgroup extends that of Robins et al [4] by the inclusion
of sequences from seven new samples, three of R. lutreolus and four of R. villosissimus (for sample details see
Tables 1 and 2). The vole outgroup was not included
because of the difficulty in aligning the D-loop. This
alignment was analysed in three ways: with three partitions (codon positions 1+2, codon position 3 as RY, and
all other positions see Additional File 2), with each
genomic region as a separate but unencoded partition
(Additional File 3), and as a concatenated sequence with
no partitions. The coding of sequence labels in the
nexus files to species names and GenBank accessions is
given in Additional File 4.
A third alignment (3G-WG) was created (Additional
File 5) by extracting the 3G regions from the specimens
in the WG dataset. This enabled us to assess whether
the differences in the results obtained using the WG
and 3G datasets were due to the specimens or to the
genomic regions used.
Of the gene regions that we have sequenced, cytochrome b is the most widely represented among rodent
species in GenBank. To test whether the AustraloPapuan clade was monophyletic we assembled a rodent
alignment of cytochrome b sequences from 245 representatives of Rattus sensu lato [24] (see Additional File
6). This included our data as well as additional data
deposited in GenBank by Pagès et al. [11], Jansa et al.
[9], and Rowe et al. [10]. The sequences from the various studies tended to be either ~700 or ~1200 bp in
length. Further we wished to use both unencoded and

The optimal substitution model was determined in previous work [5] to be GTR + I + G 4 . This model was
used in partitioned maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference analyses. ML analyses were performed on
the WG dataset with PAUP* [25] and RAxML [26].
Other exploratory ML analyses were performed using
PHYML [27]. Phylogenetic trees were estimated from
the WG, 3G, 3G-WG and the four rodent cytochrome b
alignments under Bayesian inference with MrBayes [28].
For the WG dataset, three Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) chains for each of two independent runs proceeded for 8,500,000 generations with trees being
sampled every 5000 generations. The burnin length
1,500,000 was determined by examination of -lnL versus
MCMC generation plots and sampling efficiency within
Tracer 1.5 [29]. For the 3G and 3G-WG datasets, three
MCMC chains for each of two independent runs were
sampled for 10,000,000 generations with trees sampled
every 1000 generations. The burnin length of 100,000
generations was chosen by the same method.
In addition to the three phylogenetic trees estimated
from each of the WG, 3G and 3G-WG datasets, estimations were made using ML for alignments based on single gene regions from both the WG and 3G datasets. In
all, 18 tree topologies were obtained for the species
represented in the WG dataset. Support in the WG
dataset among these alternative topologies was examined using the Kishino-Hasegawa (KH) [30] and
approximately unbiased (AU) [31] tests within the
CONSEL program [32]. Sitewise log likelihoods were
combined from the GTR + I + G4 (CF87 + I + G4 for
RY-coded data) maximum likelihood (ML) analyses run
in PAUP* for each of the separately run partitions.
We assessed variation along the genome in the
strength of support for the two main topologies, that
with the clade comprising R. lutreolus, R. sordidus, R.
tunneyi and R. villosissimus (Figure 1) or that with the
clade comprising R. fuscipes, R. leucopus and R. praetor
(Figure 2B) as a more recent divergence. The whole
genome alignment was subdivided into 1000 bp sections, and an ML bootstrap analysis performed on

each non-partitioned section using PHYML and the
GTR+G+I model of evolution. We estimated the frequency of each clade for each region among the bootstrap trees.
BEAST [33] was used to apply Bayesian inference to
the estimation of divergence dates within the phylogenies of the WG, 3G and 3G-WG species. For the WG
dataset, as in previous work [5], a partitioned analysis
was performed in which codon positions 1 and 2 were
combined, RNA stem and loop partitions were combined and codon position 3 was coded as RY, to counteract the effects of rate heterogeneity and substitution
saturation at hypervariable sites. The MCMC chain was

run for 10,000,000 generations, with both trees and ages
sampled every 5,000 generations. The “relaxed” clock
method was used in which rates along branches are distributed according to a lognormal distribution [34]. For
the 3G and 3G-WG datasets, a partitioned analysis was
performed in which codon positions 1 and 2 were combined, codon position 3 was coded as RY and all other
sites formed the third partition. A birth-death model of

Figure 2 (A) Bayesian Inference chronogram and (B) ML and MrBayes tree estimated for the three genome region (3G) dataset. Clades
are individually colored, and labelled according to the “phylogenetic species” identified in Robins et al [4]. The grey bars represent the 95%
credible intervals for tMRCAs for Rattus clades from BEAST. In the BEAST tree (A), the outgroup has been removed, the Asian and the AustraloPapuan clades are constrained to be monophyletic and a prior is assigned to the root age as described in the text. The ML and MrBayes tree
(B) is labelled with bootstrap support (BS) and the Bayesian posterior probability (BPP) at each node (BS/BPP). The mouse outgroup has been
removed to improve legibility. Sequences marked with * are from the WG dataset.

clade credibility trees with node heights set to the median of sampled values using TreeAnnotator [33].
We applied age constraints on two nodes to calibrate
our BEAST analysis of the WG dataset: the split
between Muridae (mouse plus rats) and Cricetidae
(vole), that is the root node, and the split between Mus
and Rattus within Muridae. As in previous work [5] we
used the recommendations of Benton and Donoghue
[35] for the minimum and maximum age constraints of
the mouse-rat divergence. They state that current
research suggests that the split between Mus and Rattus
is early in the evolution of Murinae but not basal in the
divergence of the clade. They recommend a lower
bound of 12.3 Mya since this is the oldest record of
Progonomys, the genus assumed to contain the common
ancestor of Mus and Rattus and an upper bound of 11
Mya which is based on records of the extinct genus
Karnimata which is believed to be on the lineage leading to Rattus. These bounds were used respectively for
the middle 95% of the normally distributed prior. The
Mus plus Rattus clade was enforced relative to the vole
which is in agreement with all recent molecular and
morpological interpretations. A uniform prior from 11
to 34 Mya for Muridae (mouse and rats) versus Cricetidae (vole) provided a calibration on the root that is very
conservative at both the upper and lower bounds (see
[36]).
The chronogram obtained (as described above) from
BEAST for the 3G dataset contained unrealistically old
ages for the nodes in the tree and a topology that differed markedly from that estimated for the WG dataset.
Consequently, to test the effect of substitutional saturation, a further BEAST analysis was performed using a
coalescent prior and constant population size. Here, the
Mus outgroup was removed because of the long branch
lengths between Mus and Rattus and potential saturation in the hypervariable region of the D-loop. The
Asian and Australo-Papuan clades were each constrained to be monophyletic and the age of the root, the
age of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) for
Rattus, was assigned a lognormal prior based on the
empirical results from the WG analysis.

dataset was used. Differences in the relationships among
Australian species were also inferred when New Guinean sequences were included in the analysis of Australian species. The greatest uncertainty in relationships
among the Australian species was due to different root
placements being optimal for the Australo-Papuan clade
in some analyses of the different datasets. As we discuss,
these observations are consistent with expectations for
rapid speciation [37,38].
The whole genome (WG) dataset

The trees estimated by ML and Bayesian inference from
the WG dataset have the same topology (Figure 1) with
the minor exception of differences in the branching
order among the R. norvegicus sequences. The topological relationships within the clade of Asian species (R.
exulans, R. norvegicus, R. rattus and R. tanezumi) are
the same as previously recovered [5]. The AustraloPapuan species (R. fuscipes, R. leucopus, R. lutreolus, R.
praetor, R. sordidus, R. tunneyi and R. villosissimus)
form a sister clade to the Asian clade. Overall eighteen
hypotheses regarding the relationships among the Australo-Papuan clade of Rattus were tested using the
CONSEL program. The log-likelihood differences
between the optimal topology and the other hypotheses
of relationship for the WG data are given in Table 4.
The relationships represented in Figure 1 had the highest likelihood, but four other topologies were clearly not
significantly poorer and a fifth was only marginally not
significantly poorer. Common features of the five best
trees include a) the early divergence of R. praetor and
R. leucopus from the other lineages, and b) the late
divergence of R. sordidus and R. villosissimus. Trees in
which R. praetor diverge late (e.g. 12, 16, 18 ) are much
poorer than the best trees.
The Australo-Papuan clade has strong support from
both ML and Bayesian inference (Figure 1). Within the
Australo-Papuan clade, the analyses of the WG dataset
indicate support for R. sordidus and R. villosissimus as
sister taxa, with the inclusion of R. lutreolus, R. tunneyi
and then R. fuscipes as one moves back in time. The
order of divergence of R. praetor and R. leucopus is somewhat uncertain; the time interval between the dates of
divergence is small and ML bootstrap support is weak.

Topology

Three mitochondrial gene (3G) region (Cyt b, COI, D-Loop)
datasets

Three datasets were used for phylogenetic reconstructions. These differed in their extent of taxon sampling
and in their sequence length (whole mitochondrial genomes (WG): 16 taxa 16293-16309 characters; three
genomic regions (3G): 126 taxa 1952 characters; whole
mitochondrial genomes trimmed to three regions (3GWG): 16 taxa 1952 characters). As described below,
similar but different topologies were inferred for relationships among the Asian clade when the larger taxon

Phylogenetic analysis of the 3G dataset obtained from
ML and MrBayes analyses, when the codon positions
are partitioned and RY encoding used, returned the
same topology (Figure 2B) corresponding to topology 12
in Table 4 where, as a member of the PNG I clade,
R. praetor diverges recently and R. lutreolus, R. sordidus,
R. tunneyi and R. villosissimus have more basal positions. This topology is not supported by the WG dataset
(see Figure 1).

A slightly different topology again was found when the
3G dataset was analysed with MrBayes without RY
encoding, either with the alignment partitioned by
region or simply concatenated. Here, the order of divergence of R. leucopus and R. praetor is reversed, and R.
lutreolus and R. tunneyi form a clade. This corresponds
to topology 4 of Table 4.
The major differences in tree topology inferred from
the 3G dataset, as compared with the WG dataset, may
derive from the impact of the many additional
sequences in the 3G dataset or from the reduction in
the number of genomic regions and partitions, and the
inclusion of the hypervariable D-loop. To test this possibility, the 3G dataset was pruned of all sequences not in
the WG dataset. For the tree returned by a BEAST analysis of this 3G-WG dataset (Figure 3A; topology 16 in
Table 4), the unrooted topology of the Australo-Papuan
clade is highly similar to that shown in Figure 1. It differs only in the position of R. praetor, however, the root
of the Australo-Papuan clade is placed differently. Both
ML and MrBayes estimations of the phylogenetic tree
produced a topology (Figure 3B) with notable differences in the positions of the root of the AustraloPapuan clade and of R. tunneyi (topology 18 in Table 4).
The frequency along the genome for the two topologies, that with the clade comprising R. lutreolus, R. sordidus, R. tunneyi and R. villosissimus (Figure 1) or that

with the clade comprising R. fuscipes, R. leucopus and R.
praetor (Figure 2B) as a more recent divergence is summarized in Figure 4. The support for these clades is
highly variable along the genomes. The fragment containing the D-loop provided the strongest support for
the (R. fuscipes, R. leucopus and R. praetor) clade.
Further, it contained strong support for the (R. lutreolus,
R. sordidus, R. tunneyi and R. villosissimus) clade. The
sections containing the COI and Cyt b genomic regions
provided only weak support for either of these clades.
Another approach to testing the effects of the gene
regions used was to remove the outgroup and constrain
the height of the tree. This will reduce the possibility of
misplacing the root of the Australo-Papuan clade as a
result of long branch attraction relative to the outgroup
and stochastic artefacts. It will also diminish the influence of hypervariable regions of the sequence. The
topology returned from this analysis (Figure 2A) was
very similar to, and not significantly different from, that
obtained in the WG analysis (Figure 1), corresponding
to topology 2, or marginally topology 1, in Table 4.
In summary, both the 3G and 3G-WG datasets gave
topologies significantly different from that obtained using
the WG dataset when Bayesian inference (both BEAST
and MrBayes) or maximum likelihood was used to analyse
partitioned and RY-coded datasets. Reducing the effects of
the outgroup or the hypervariable regions enabled us to

recover the WG topology. Consequently we can infer that
it was the use of only these three limited genomic regions,
rather than the inclusion of many additional sequences,
that led to the inference of a different topology from the
3G dataset than from those of the pruned 3G-WG and the
WG datasets. Nevertheless our analyses of the 3G dataset
provided generally well supported species clades which are
useful for species identification.
The four cytochrome b alignments returned very similar results. We provide the tree with species clades collapsed for greater legibility in Additional File 7 and as a

full tree file in Additional File 8. In each analysis the
order of divergence was Maxomys deepest followed by
Micromys, Niviventer and Leopoldamys. The AustraloPapuan rats always formed a well-supported monophyletic clade. The clades representing Bandicota, Berylmys,
Tarsomys, Limnomys, R. norvegicus and its sister species
R. nitidus, and the remaining clade of Asian rats were
each observed consistently with high support. However,
the relationships among them were unstable and were
not resolved with high posterior probability or bootstrap
support (results not shown).

that the sum of the bootstrap proportions can exceed 100% when both clades occur in a tree as in the D-loop region of the genome.

Dates of Divergence

The addition of seven genomes has made more recent
the estimated MRCAs within the Rattus genus when
compared with previous work [5]. The median age of
the split between the Asian and Australo-Papuan clades
is estimated to be 2.7 Mya (95% credible interval 1.7 3.9 Mya). Our previous estimate of this date, based on
eight Asian rat genomes but only a single genome from
the Australo-Papuan clade (R. praetor), was near the
upper bound at 3.8 Mya. Similarly, the previous estimate
of tMRCA of the Asian clade, at 3.1 Mya, falls near the
upper bound of the estimate obtained here with median
2.3 and 95% credible range 1.4 - 3.3 Mya. The MRCA
for the Australo-Papuan clade is 1.66 Mya, and the
most recent divergence within that clade, between
R. sordidus and R. villosissimus, is estimated to be
approximately 500,000 ya (Table 5).
When the dates of divergence were estimated for the
3G dataset, nodes in the tree were more than twice as
old as when estimated using the WG dataset. However,
when the MRCA for Rattus was constrained, the ages of
the divergences in the Australo-Papuan clade (Figure
2A) more closely resembled those obtained from the
WG dataset.
The estimates of the node ages obtained using the 3GWG dataset (Figure 3) are comparable but slightly older
than those obtained from the whole genome. The Asian
- Australo-Papuan split is at 3.2 Mya as compared with
2.7 Mya, and the Australo-Papuan clade has a MRCA of

1.87 Mya as compared with 1.66 Mya from the whole
genome. In contrast, the deeper splits within the Asian
clade have nearly the same estimated age. The divergence of R. norvegicus is estimated to be 2.28 Mya, as
compared with 2.25 Mya, and the divergence of R. exulans from the other Rattus at 1.81 versus 1.77 Mya when
the whole genome was used.

Discussion
Whole mitochondrial genomes have been used to infer
phylogenetic relationships in a wide range of organisms
e.g., mammals [39-43], birds [44], fish [45] and worms
[46]. Phylogenies based on mitochondrial genomes are
effectively gene trees and so may not recover the true
species tree [47]. While it may be useful also to develop
phylogenies based on nuclear markers, there are several
reasons why the use of whole mitochondrial genomes
provide good indicators of species history. The mitochondrial genome, being haploid and lacking recombination, effectively has four-fold lower coalescence times
relative to diploid nuclear genes. This gives much
greater phylogenetic resolution than slower evolving
nuclear genes. Hence mitochondrial genomes are
expected to be good indicators of species history.
Our phylogeny estimated from the WG dataset (Figure 1) is well resolved except for the relative positions
of R. leucopus and R. praetor. The top six observed tree
topologies (Table 4) have one or the other of these two
species diverging earliest in the Australo-Papuan clade.

Median estimates (Mya) with 95% credible limits for the MRCA of the Australo-Papuan clade of Rattus species and the divergences within that clade (Figure 1).

Both species diverge earlier than any of the Australian
native rats and there is marginally more support for
R. praetor diverging earliest. This phylogeny clarifies the
relationships among the rats of the Rattus fuscipes species group and is consistent with the taxonomy of Musser and Carleton [1]. The occurrence of R. villosissimus
and R. sordidus as sister species in a shallow divergence
is concordant with the phenetic results of Taylor et al.
[13], and the phylogenies of Baverstock [14] and Aplin
[17]. The more recent divergence of R. lutreolus compared with R. tunneyi differs from these earlier phylogenies where R. lutreolus is either basal to R. tunneyi
[13,17] or in an unresolved polytomy that includes R.
fuscipes and R. leucopus [14]. In our phylogeny the position of R. lutreolus within the Australian native rat clade
supports Aplin’s [17] view that this rat is more closely
related to Australian than to New Guinean rats. The
position of R. fuscipes basal in our Australian native rat
clade but a more recent divergence than that of R. leucopus differs from the results of Taylor et al. [13] whose
phenogram shows R. fuscipes within a clade of New
Guinean rats and diverging earlier than the New Guinean species R. leucopus.
Our choice of samples for whole mitochondrial genome analysis was influenced by our confidence in the
correct assignment of species to those samples. Where
there was congruence between the named species and
the phylogenetic clades we were confident in the identifications. In Robins et al. [4] we discussed the difficulties
that arose when OTUs contained heterogeneous collections of named species. These names were assigned by
either the museum or the collector. The source of such
heterogeneity could be misidentification, faulty taxonomy due to the plethora of synonyms used for Rattus
species, hybridisation, incomplete lineage sorting or
some combination of the above. Pagès et al. [11],
although they explicitly avoided rats from the AustraloPapuan clade, reported a similar problem. They identified a heterogeneous clade (R3) that was similar to, and
where they incorporated data from Robins et al. [4],
essentially the same as the diardii clade (Figure 2)
therein. In this paper we again resolved the diardii

clade. When Pagès et al. [11] considered the same species as we, their genetic based species identifications are
largely congruent with ours. This finding supports the
usefulness of shorter mitochondrial sequences for species identification. Of the 14 Rattus specimens we used
for the whole mitochondrial genomes, 11 were from
homogeneous clades. The exceptions were the exulans
clade which from a total of 21 samples contained two
almost certainly misidentified samples and two New
Guinean clades PNG I and verecundus. Our New Guinean species clades are all problematic and to resolve
the conflict DNA is needed from specimens that have
accurate morphological identifications. All six of the
specimens of R. praetor that we have processed fell into
the PNG I clade and we used one of these samples to
represent the clade. At this time we have insufficient
information to account for the heterogeneity of this
clade although some possibilities are discussed in Robins
et al. [4]. The Australian Rattus specimens on the other
hand all fell into well supported homogeneous clades
thus the phylogenetic assignment of species was in
agreement with that of the museum or collector.
Our cytochrome b analyses generally gave robust species clades. Further, the Australo-Papuan rats were in a
well-supported and monophyletic clade in all analyses.
However, the relationships within Rattus sensu stricto
[24], especially among Bandicota, Berylmys, the Philippine endemics (Tarsomys, Limnomys and Rattus everetti)
and the main Asian and Australo-Papuan clades of Rattus, were poorly resolved. On the other hand, the deeper
relationships within Rattus sensu lato were wellsupported. Pagès et al. [11] stated that they did not
obtain a robust phylogeny when they analysed cytochrome b alone. Interestingly, even when they analysed
three concatenated genes (one nuclear and two mitochondrial) they were unable to place Bandicota conclusively within or sister to Rattus. Thus the currently
available data is insufficient to address the question of
monophyly within Rattus as a whole.
The ancestral node in the Australo-Papuan clade differed with the genomic regions used. The inclusion of
the hypervariable D-loop (Figures 2B and 3) moved the

Robins et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:375
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/375

root deeper into the clade, relative to its placement
when the whole genome was used (Figure 1) or when
the MRCA of Rattus was constrained (Figure 2A). It is
likely that the differences arise from substitution rate
differences between D-loop and the rest of the genome.
The hypervariable nature of the D-loop, with the potential for substitution saturation, also contributed to the
inflation (two- to three-fold increase) of dates of divergence in the unconstrained BEAST tree based on the
3G dataset compared with that of the WG dataset.
Although the deeper branching orders are uncertain
within the Australo-Papuan clade for the 3G and the
3G-WG phylogenies (Figures 2 and 3) the Australian
native Rattus species, including the newly added
R. lutreolus and R. villosissimus samples fall into well
differentiated clades reinforcing the usefulness of shorter
mitochondrial DNA sequences for species identification
[48]. The position of two samples from New Guinea,
misidentified as R. rattus and labelled as OTU rattus II
in Figures 2A and 2B, as sister to R. villosissimus which
is in turn sister to R. sordidus suggests that these samples are in fact R. villosissimus. The usefulness of these
shorter sequences, however, to elucidate deeper evolutionary relationships or to date divergences is expected
to be limited given the difficulties in inferring species
relationships for rapid radiations [37,38]. The deeper
branches of the Australo-Papuan clade in Figures 2 and
3 are all quite short, indicative of a period of rapid
diversification, but the branching pattern varies with the
methods used and no one pattern is well supported. It
is possible that the inclusion of one or more nuclear
markers could help resolve this pattern and is an
approach to be pursued in the future, however, given
their greater effective population size and longer coalescence times, nuclear genes are likely to be less powerful
in resolving the order of divergences. They will, however, provide evidence regarding whether mitochondrial
gene trees provide accurate estimates of the deeper species relationships [e.g., [49]].
The dates inferred from the WG dataset analysis are
congruent with earlier studies. Jansa et al. [9], using just
the IRBP nuclear gene, estimated a date of 3-4 Mya for
the origin of a clade containing R. exulans, R. tanezumi
and, R. preator (sic). This is the equivalent of our 2.7
Mya split between the Asian and the Australo-Papuan
clade (See Figure 1). When Jansa et al. [9] included both
IRBP and cyt b data in their analysis the age of the
nodes increased three fold and when cyt b alone was
used the ages increased four fold. We had a similar problem with the 3G dataset which when analysed in
BEAST, without the constraints described in the methods, returned dates that were almost three fold older
than those returned by the WG dataset. It is worth noting also that we observed slightly older dates ~4.6 Mya

Page 13 of 16

(unpublished data) for the Asian/Australo-Papuan split
on standard (ACGT) coding, compared with ~3.51 Mya
obtained when we RY coded our 2008 [5] whole mitochondrial dataset. Rowe et al. [10] included three Rattus
sp. in their analyses of the old endemic murines of the
Sahul. They recovered evidence for the Asian/AustraloPapuan split with R. leucopus and R. villosissimus forming a sister pair relative to R. norvegicus. Although they
did not report a chronogram, we can obtain a rough
estimate of the age of the MRCA for Rattus from their
Figure 4. The depth of the MRCA of Rattus was 26% of
the depth of the closest dated node (B) in its ancestry
(their Table 1), giving an estimated age of 2.52 (2.26 2.81) Mya. This date is concordant with our estimate of
2.7 Mya.
Our dates are also consistent with the earlier study of
Robins et al. [5]. Whilst the node dates obtained from
our WG BEAST analysis are all slightly younger than
the equivalent ones from the previous study they are
within the 95% credible intervals of the 2008 study.
Since we have increased the sample size of the Australo-Papuan clade representation from one to eight the
dates we report here are more reliable. These younger
dates align more closely with those from the L1 (LINE1, long interspersed repeated) retrotransposable elements study of Verneau et al. [24] who estimated the
timing of several major speciation events within Rattus
sensu stricto of which the two most recent are relevant
to our study. The first at ~2.7 Mya gave rise to five
lineages one of which led to R. fuscipes (the only representative of the Australian and New Guinean rats in
their study) and another led to Asian Rattus species.
This divergence is the equivalent of the split between
our Asian and Australo-Papuan clades also dated at
~2.7 Mya.
The five lineage speciation events described by Verneau et al. [24] and the origin of the Australo-Papuan
and Asian clades all estimated at ~2.7 Mya coincided
with Pleistocene Ice Age events. The onset of the Pleistocene glaciation cycles was at about 3 Mya [50] and by
2.6 Mya the Pleistocene Ice Age was well established
[51]. Major changes occurred in climate and available
land in the region encompassing Island Southeast Asia,
New Guinea and Australia. Such changes, for example
at the highest glacial maxima New Guinea, Australia,
and the islands of Misool, Waigeo, the Aru archipelago
and Tasmania formed a single land mass[18], would
have provided routes for dispersal and subsequently
opportunities for speciation in Rattus. Also during the
same time period, there was considerable dispersal of
marsupials (bandicoots, dasyurids, phalangerid possums,
and kangaroos) between New Guinea and Australia but
diversification was more limited [52]. We can speculate
that there was greater niche overlap between the newly

Robins et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:375
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/375

migrated and endemic marsupials while Rattus was not
so ecologically constrained. Glacial cycling with some 20
cycles in the last two million years continued to contribute to ongoing climate and sea level changes [17,50]
and during this time radiation also continued in Rattus.
The more recent speciation events described by Verneau et al. [24] were a radiation in the Asian Rattus
clade. Verneau et al’s [24] study included 12 Asian Rattus species and four of these are represented in our
study; R. norvegicus, R. exulans R. rattus and R. tanezumi. Their divergence estimates were in the time period 1.2 Mya to about 0.5 Mya. Our results are
reasonably concordant with but probably more reliable
than theirs because their analysis assumed a fixed rate
molecular clock. In their L1 study the timing of the
divergence of the R. norvegicus lineage at ~1.8 Mya
compares with ~2.3 Mya in our study; R. exulans at ~1
Mya compares with our ~1.7 Mya and the divergence
between R. rattus and R. tanezumi at 0.5 Mya compares
with ours at ~0.3 Mya. The divergences in our Australo-Papuan clade occur over a similar time period (1.7
Mya - 0.5 Mya) as that in the Asian clade. R. praetor
diverged at ~1.7 Mya, R. leucopus at ~1.6 Mya, R. fuscipes at ~1.4 Mya, R. tunneyi at ~1 Mya, R. lutreolus at
~0.9 Mya and the sister species R. sordidus and R. villosissimus at ~0.5 Mya. Despite the uncertainty in assigning the order of the deepest divergences in our
Australo-Papuan clade, which is exacerbated by the relatively short time frame of ~0.2 My in which they
occurred, the overall pattern from the WG and the 3G
datasets suggests that the founding Rattus lineages
reached New Guinea by at least 1.7 Mya and Australia
by 1.4 Mya with further diversification occurring in both
areas between ~1 - 0.5 Mya.
When sea levels were as little as 10 m below present
land bridges would have connected New Guinea and
Australia at the Torres Strait [53]. These land bridges
which have occurred intermittently have also provided
opportunities in more recent times for the reinvasion
and subsequent isolation of rats between New Guinea
and Australia in the Torres Strait area. In our phylogeny
R. sordidus and R. villosissimus diverged most recently
in the Australian Rattus clade. This position is consistent with an Australian origin of R. sordidus. In contrast
the R. leucopus lineage diverged earlier than any of the
native Australian rats thus supporting a New Guinean
origin. The recent split between the Australian and New
Guinean sister lineages at ~0.6 Mya suggests an invasion
of Australia by R. leucopus followed by isolation. Our
findings, therefore, support the Torres Strait faunal
interchange hypothesis first put forward by Tate [15,16]
with later support from Taylor and Horner [12], Taylor
et al. [13] and Aplin [17].

Conclusions
Although Rattus is a problematic genus and further
investigations of the Australo-Papuan group are needed
to resolve the relationships of the Rattus species of New
Guinea we have clarified the pattern and timing of
divergences among the Australian rats. Our whole mitochondrial genome analyses are concordant with Musser
and Carleton’s [1]Rattus fuscipes species group and
resolve the positions of R. fuscipes and R. lutreolus
within it. Our findings suggest that Rattus invaded Australia from New Guinea about 1.4 Mya and that this
was followed by a period of rapid speciation. Our results
also support and suggest a date of ~0.5 Mya for the
hypothesized [15,16] more recent invasions across
Torres Strait of R. sordidus into New Guinea and R. leucopus into Australia.
