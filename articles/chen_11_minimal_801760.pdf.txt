Minimal regulatory spaces in yeast genomes
Wei-Hua Chen1, Wu Wei1 and Martin J Lercher2*

Abstract
Background: The regulatory information encoded in the DNA of promoter regions usually enforces a minimal,
non-zero distance between the coding regions of neighboring genes. However, the size of this minimal regulatory
space is not generally known. In particular, it is unclear if minimal promoter size differs between species and
between uni- and bi-directionally acting regulatory regions.
Results: Analyzing the genomes of 11 yeasts, we show that the lower size limit on promoter-containing regions is
species-specific within a relatively narrow range (80-255 bp). This size limit applies equally to regions that initiate
transcription on one or both strands, indicating that bi-directional promoters and uni-directional promoters are
constrained similarly. We further find that young, species-specific regions are on average much longer than older
regions, suggesting either a bias towards deletions or selection for genome compactness in yeasts. While the
length evolution of promoter-less intergenic regions is well described by a simplistic, purely neutral model, regions
containing promoters typically show an excess of unusually long regions. Regions flanked by divergently
transcribed genes have a bi-modal length distribution, with short lengths found preferentially among older regions.
These old, short regions likely harbor evolutionarily conserved bi-directionally active promoters. Surprisingly, some
of the evolutionarily youngest regions in two of the eleven species (S. cerevisiae and K. waltii) are shorter than the
lower limit observed in older regions.
Conclusions: The minimal chromosomal space required for transcriptional regulation appears to be relatively
similar across yeast species, and is the same for uni-directional and bi-directional promoters. New intergenic
regions created by genome rearrangements tend to evolve towards the more narrow size distribution found
among older regions.

Background
Expression of a gene requires a functional promoter
region 5’ of the coding sequence. Promoter regions
encompass the binding sites for DNA polymerase, usually
accompanied by cis-regulatory sequences. It is likely that
this regulatory information - including spacers and the 5’
untranslated region (UTR) - needs a minimum length of
DNA sequence. In most cases, promoter regions will not
overlap with the coding or UTR regions of neighbouring
genes, both because of functional constraints and because
transcription of the neighbour gene would interfere with
transcription initiation at the promoter [1,2]. A lower
size limit for promoter regions can thus be obtained
from the length distribution of promoter containing

regions located between the coding sequences of gene
pairs (inter-CDS regions).
We can classify inter-CDS regions according to the relative orientation of the two genes flanking the region. First,
the two genes can be located on the same strand, and
will thus be transcribed uni-directionally (®® or ¬¬,
Figure 1). This type of inter-CDS region will contain the
promoter for one gene, which flanks the region with its 5’
end. Second, the two genes can be transcribed divergently
(¬®), with the promoter region(s) of both genes located
in the inter-CDS region. The two flanking genes can have
two fully independent promoter regions, or one shared
promoter region may act bi-directionally [3-5]. Finally, the
two flanking genes may be transcribed convergently
(®¬), and in this case the inter-CDS region does not
contain a promoter. When examining our hypothesis of a
minimal regulatory/promoter space, the size distributions
of these promoter-less ‘convergent’ regions can be used as
a Null expectation. If non-functional yeast DNA tends to

be removed either by selection or by a mutational bias [6],
then convergent inter-CDS regions should on average be
shorter than either ‘uni-directional’ or ‘divergent’ regions,
and they should not have a ‘hard’ lower limit.
In genomes that contain many repetitive and non-functional sequences, such as the human genome, few interCDS regions come close to the lower limit indicative of a
minimal promoter space. For our question it is hence
desirable to study compact genomes. Unicellular yeasts
are ideal for this purpose, as a large number of yeast genomes has been sequenced, and as these species typically
have small genomes with short inter-CDS regions. Below,
we therefore concentrate on Saccharomyces cerevisiae
and its relatives.
Genomic rearrangements may often create inter-CDS
regions that are substantially shorter or longer than the
inter-CDS regions that were broken up. If a resulting promoter region is too short, this will result in functional
impairment (e.g., because individual sites involved in polymerase binding are missing or are too close to each other).
It is conceivable that sometimes this impairment is outweighed by accompanying expression changes that are
advantageous [7], and such an imperfect promoter region
may still spread through the population. In such cases, we
expect that the promoter region will be extended through
insertions over evolutionary time to regain optimal functionality. Conversely, newly created regions may also be
unusually long; while this may not affect promoter function, we expect a length reduction over time, either due to
a mutational bias towards deletions [6] or due to selection
for genome compactness. Overall, we expect that evolutionarily young inter-CDS regions may have a different
length distribution compared with older regions [1]. We
therefore focus on old inter-CDS regions throughout most

of this study, which are more likely to represent the equilibrium size distribution.
By far the strongest predictor of gene neighbourhood
conservation is intergenic or inter-CDS distance [8]. This
is consistent with a purely mechanistic (non-selective)
model of rearrangements, and indicates that most rearrangements between genes are neutral. Under this model,
long regions are most likely to disappear during evolution, and the size distribution of inter-CDS regions
should evolve towards an equilibrium state. Below, we
find that a very simple neutral model is indeed capable of
explaining the variation of length distributions with evolutionary age of the convergent inter-CDS regions, but
fails to fully capture the dynamics of promoter containing
regions in most species.
In this paper, we thus analyse the length distributions of
inter-CDS regions across yeast species to examine the following questions: (i) are promoter-containing regions
longer than promoterless regions, indicating a minimal
promoter length?; (ii) does minimal promoter size differ
between uni-directional and divergent regions?; (iii) does
minimal promoter size differ between species?; and (iv)
can the size distribution of inter-CDS regions be explained
by a simplistic neutral model of rearrangements?

Results
We identified inter-CDS regions flanked by protein coding genes in 11 fully sequenced and well-annotated
yeast species [9,10]. Regions flanked by tandemly duplicated genes may be under special forms of selection [11]
and may hence evolve differently; these regions were
removed from further analysis.
Inter-CDS regions that were recently formed by genomic rearrangements may not have had time to evolve

Chen et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:320
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/320

towards their ‘optimal’ length [1]. For each examined
yeast genome, we therefore focused first on ancestral
(’old’) regions, i.e., those that have an orthologous interCDS region in another yeast species (see Materials and
methods); all other inter-CDS regions are labelled
‘young’.
A narrow, species-specific length distribution in inter-CDS
regions lacking promoters

It is generally assumed that most cis-regulatory
sequences are organized into promoter regions located
directly 5’ of their regulated genes. Accordingly, few cisregulatory sequences should be found in inter-CDS
regions flanked by the 3’ ends of convergently transcribed genes. We thus expect that such ‘convergent’
inter-CDS regions have no hard limits on their size distribution. Furthermore, if DNA insertions and deletions
were selectively neutral and unbiased in these regions,
then length changes per unit time via indels should be
proportional to the region length (as each nucleotide
would have the same chance of being an insertion or
deletion point). On log-scale, such random length
changes over time would be additive, and we hence
expect a log-normal distribution of lengths under these
conditions. In agreement with this expectation, Figure 1
and Additional file 1 show approximately log-normal
length distributions for old convergent regions in all 11
examined yeast species.
Mean inter-CDS length of convergent pairs is fairly
similar across species, ranging from 153 bp in Kluyveromyces waltii to 316 bp in Saccharomyces bayanus
(Table 1). Lengths within one species typically vary by a
factor of two (standard deviation 0.30-0.45 on the log10scale). This relatively narrow range indicates that each
yeast has its species-specific equilibrium length of convergent regions. A ‘soft’ lower limit >0 bp is likely due
to the 3’ UTRs, and may further be enforced by the
avoidance of transcriptional interference between the
flanking genes (see [2] and references therein). An
equally soft upper limit may result from a bias towards
deletions (rather than insertions) in non-functional
DNA [6], but may also stem from a higher probability
of rearrangements in longer regions [8] (see below).
A lower limit on the length of promoter-containing
regions

If successful transcription initiation and regulation
requires a minimal set of cis-regulatory nucleotides, we
expect that regions neighbouring at least one 5’ CDS
end require a minimal length. Consistent with this
expectation, Figure 1 and Additional file 1 show that in
all examined species, there are practically no old unidirectional or divergent inter-CDS regions shorter than
approximately 130 bp (see Table 1 for summary

Page 3 of 10

statistics of the length distributions and Additional file 2
for statistics of underrepresentation of old uni-directional and divergent pairs at short distances). This lower
size limit appears to be species-specific within a relatively narrow range, varying between approximately
80 bp and 260 bp.
Interestingly, across all species, the lower size limit is
very similar between uni-directional and divergent interCDS regions (Figure 1, Additional file 1 and Table 1).
This is consistent with the existence of bi-directional
promoters in yeast [5], which initiate transcription in
both directions. Our results then suggest that minimal
bi-directional promoters require the same space as do
minimal uni-directional promoters.
In each species, promoter-containing regions are on
average at least twice as large as convergent inter-CDS
regions; in some cases, the lower size limit of promotercontaining regions coincides with the peak of the convergent length distribution. This difference supports the
requirement of promoter-binding and cis-regulatory
sites as the cause for the minimal length of promotercontaining regions, and hence justifies our approach a
posteriori.
The length distribution of old uni-directional inter-CDS
regions can be approximated reasonably well by a log-normal distribution, with two small deviations (Figure 1 and
Additional file 1). The left slope of the logarithmic length
distribution, which corresponds to the minimal length, is
usually steeper than the right slope; the latter probably
does not reflect a hard limit. Furthermore, the right tail is
elevated, indicating an excess of longer regions. It is possible that these long regions harbour unusually large numbers of cis-regulatory nucleotides, or that they contain
other un-annotated functional sequences.
Similar length distributions for all but the youngest interCDS regions

The age of inter-CDS regions can be approximated by
the divergence time of the last common ancestor of the
query genome and the most distal genome with an
orthologous inter-CDS region. We reconstructed the
phylogenetic relationships of the 11 yeast genomes using
Schizosaccharomyces pombe as an outgroup (Additional
file 3), and then classified the S. cerevisiae inter-CDS
regions into three age groups (see Materials and
methods).
As shown in Figure 2, the minimal length of promoter-containing regions is very similar across all but the
youngest age groups, suggesting that this minimum
length is maintained by selection. The youngest age
group shows a much broader length distribution, suggesting that these regions did not have enough time to
evolve towards the equilibrium distribution seen for
older regions. Consistent with Figure 1, the minimal

Figure 2 Minimal length of inter-CDS regions doesn’t increase with the age of the regions. Depending on the phylogenetic distance to
orthologous neighbouring gene pairs, we classified inter-CDS regions in S. cerevisiae into four age groups: ‘young’, ‘plain old’ (PO), ‘very old’ (VO),
and ‘extra old’ (XO) (see Methods). (A) regions flanked by divergently transcribed genes; (B) regions flanked by uni-directionally transcribed
genes; (C) regions flanked by convergently transcribed genes. The length distributions of all three ‘old’ age groups are very similar, except for the
‘divergent’ regions, where the relative weight shifts from the higher to the lower peak with increasing age.

Chen et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:320

length appears to be very similar between uni-directional and divergent regions in each age class.
Minimal inter-CDS length is correlated with genome size
and total intergenic space

In the presence of either a bias towards deletions or
selection for genome compactness, we expect a strong
correlation between total intergenic space and minimal
promoter size. Furthermore, as genome size is the sum
of gene-coding and intergenic space, we also expect
minimal promoter size to be correlated with genome
size. Indeed, minimal promoter length across the 11
yeast species is well predicted by total intergenic space
(Pearson’s correlation coefficient R = 0.87, p = 0.00058)
and by genome size (R = 0.81, p = 0.0025). In contrast,
we find no significant correlation between minimal promoter length and the number (R = -0.21, p = 0.54) or
total length (R = 0.22, p = 0.52) of protein-coding genes.
Two types of divergently transcribed regions with
different conservation

While the logarithmic length distributions of both the
uni-directional and the convergent regions can be
approximated reasonably well by a single Gaussian, this
is not the case for the divergent regions. The latter
appears bi-modal, and is fitted significantly better with
two independent Gaussians (ANOVA: P < 10-100 for the
logarithmic length distribution of old divergent regions
in each species, comparing fits of 1 and 2 Gaussians; see
Additional file 4). The left peak roughly coincides with
the single peak of the uni-directional regions, suggesting
that it may contain a single promoter region that acts bidirectionally. Conversely, it appears likely that the longer
divergent regions contain two (at least partially) independent promoter regions.
Interestingly, while the minimal length does not vary
between age groups, the relative weight of the two peaks
for divergent regions shifts from longer regions to short
regions with increasing age (Figure 2A). If the two peaks
indeed correspond to bi-directional and independent promoters, this suggests that gene pairs linked by a bi-directional promoter are strongly conserved in evolution, as
expected. This observation is consistent with previous studies, which found that most highly conserved inter-CDS
regions in fungi tend to be bi-directional [12].
Young promoter-containing regions are also rarely short
in most species - S. cerevisiae and K. waltii being notable
exceptions

So far, we have restricted our analyses to old inter-CDS
regions, i.e., those for which an orthologous region can
be found in another yeast species. We now switch our
attention to young (species-specific) inter-CDS regions.
The length distributions of promoter-containing young

Page 5 of 10

regions also respect the minimal length derived from old
inter-CDS regions in all species - with the exception of
S. cerevisiae and K. waltii (Figure 1 and Additional file 1).
Both of the latter species show an excess of very short
regions (<100 bp).
Due to the inclusion of close relatives of S. cerevisiae
and K. waltii (Saccharomyces bayanus and Kluyveromyces
thermotolerans, respectively - see Additional file 3) in our
study, ‘young’ genes in these two species are indeed
younger than ‘young’ genes in the other species examined, except for the sibling species themselves. Thus, if
selection is responsible for the removal or extension of
short upstream regions, it may simply be that selection
has not had enough time to act in these very young sets
of inter-CDS regions (although in this case we might
expect similar patterns in the sibling species). Furthermore, a recent population expansion in S. cerevisiae during its co-evolution with human agriculture [13] may
have reduced selection against slightly deleterious short
upstream regions in this species.
Young regions are more variable in size and tend to be
longer

As evident from Figure 1, young inter-CDS regions are
more variable in size and tend to be longer [1], regardless
of gene orientation (see also Additional file 1 and Table 1).
Thus, it appears that genomic rearrangements often create
inter-CDS regions that are longer than the genomic mean.
To reach the observed distribution of older regions over
evolutionary time, these new, long regions must disappear
again. This can either happen through the deletion of
non-functional nucleotides, or through renewed rearrangement of the long regions.
It is noteworthy that the length difference between
young and old inter-CDS regions tends to be larger for
divergent compared to uni-directional regions. This is
likely a consequence of the fact that most newly created
divergent regions contain two (largely) independent promoter regions; conversely, old regions often contain one
bi-directional promoter (Figure 2), and hence require
less space on average.
A simple neutral model of distance-dependent
rearrangements

In a careful study, Poyatos and Hurst [8] found that by far
the strongest predictor of gene neighbourhood conservation in yeasts was inter-CDS length. This suggests a predominantly neutral model of gene rearrangements, where
non-homologous recombination is approximately equally
likely at each (non-functional) nucleotide. Such a simple
model necessarily ignores the importance of genomic
neighbourhoods; e.g., neighbouring genes may be co-regulated through changes in chromatin state [14,15], or may
be co-localised in regions of high or low recombination

Chen et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:320
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/320

rate [16]. However, it may be that these neighbourhood
effects are the exception rather than the rule [8], and it
hence appears fruitful to examine if the simple neutral
model is able to explain the observed differences between
the length distributions of young and old inter-CDS
regions.
Thus, we employed a simulation in which the probability that an inter-CDS region is broken up depends
only on its length. We start from the total observed
length distribution (combining old and young regions)
of a given species, using this as an approximation to the
total length distribution in the common ancestor of the
species and its closest relative in our dataset. We then
test if random rearrangements can reduce this total
‘ancestral’ distribution to the distribution seen for old
regions now (i.e., those regions that survived from the
common ancestor). In each time step, we randomly
chose an inter-CDS region and removed it from the distribution with a probability proportional to its length;
this simulates rearrangements, where ancestral regions
are destroyed to create new regions. This random
removal was repeated until the number of rearrangements was identical to the lower bound on the number
of rearrangements in the real data, i.e., until we removed
Nyoung regions. It has to be pointed out that our model
is very simplistic, not only in its assumption that rearrangements are strictly proportional to the length of the
inter-CDS region. Importantly, length changes also
occur through insertions and deletions; these are
ignored here.
If the model approximately reflects the underlying biology, then the simulated length distribution should closely
match the length distribution of old inter-CDS regions.
As evident from Figure 3 and Additional file 5, this is
indeed the case for convergent regions. In contrast, the
fit is less good for the two types of promoter containing
regions in most species. In almost all species, the
observed old length distributions show an excess of long
inter-CDS regions that is not captured in the simulations
(Figure 3 and Additional file 5; see also Additional file 6
where the model doesn’t require an ‘unbreakable’ promoter region). Thus, some long regions appear to be maintained by stabilising selection. In addition, S. cerevisiae
and K. waltii show a dearth of very short regions in the
real data compared to the simulations. This suggests that
either the real ancestor did not have a similar number of
very short young regions as the extant species, or that
these regions were preferentially removed or extended by
natural selection.
The distribution of repeat regions does not bias our
results

Repeat-sequences (e.g., TY elements) in inter-CDS regions
may serve as hot-spots for non-homologous

Page 6 of 10

recombination. Their presence may therefore modify gene
neighbourhood in a non-random, non-selective manner.
However, all results presented above remain essentially
unchanged after excluding repeat-containing inter-CDS
regions identified using RepeatMasker [17] (data not
shown). Thus, genomic repeats appear not to be driving
the evolution of intergenic length distributions.

Discussion
Promoter-containing inter-CDS regions harbour cisregulatory elements that are essential for transcriptional control and initiation. The required number of
cis-regulatory nucleotides (including spacers) may vary
according to the complexity of expression patterns
among genes. However, this will depend on how
expression signals are integrated along the hierarchy of
transcriptional regulators. For example, a transcription
factor may be induced according to complicated combinatorial cues by a variety of environmental signals.
This single transcription factor may then simply transfer these integrated signals to all its regulatory targets
- all the cis-regulatory complexity is then accounted
for by the promoter region of the transcription factor,
allowing for complex expression patterns with simple
cis-regulatory sites for the majority of genes.
We therefore expect that many genes require little
more than a minimal promoter configuration (although
some genes still require complicated regulation, consistent with the slight excess of very long regions compared
to our simple simulations). However, it appears highly
likely that successful (and orderly) initiation of transcription still requires a certain minimum of cis-regulatory
sites. That this is indeed the case is evidenced by the
length distributions of inter-CDS regions in Figure 1 and
Additional file 1, which appear truncated at low distances
for uni-directional and divergently transcribed regions,
i.e., those regions containing promoters.
Many eukaryotic promoters initiate transcription on
both strands, even if transcription often stalls in one
direction [3,4]. Consistent with this observation, we find
that the length distribution of divergent regions is bimodal, with a shorter peak that roughly co-incides with
the single peak of uni-directional regions. These peaks
likely represent optimized regulatory spaces for shared
promoters in divergent pairs and single promoters in
uni-directional pairs, respectively. The coincidence of the
two peaks results in very similar minimal inter-CDS
lengths in the two types of regions.
In S. cerevisiae, a canonical promoter of ~140 bp
upstream to transcription start sites (TSS) was previously
described [18]. This distance plus two times the median
5’UTR length (68 bp [19]) coincides perfectly with the
first peak of the old divergent regions (those that are conserved in other yeast species; Figure 4), supporting our

distributions are shown separately for young gene pairs (those without neighbouring orthologs in any other yeast species) and for older gene
pairs. Red lines are predictions for the ‘old’ distributions from a simulation of neutral rearrangements of the total distribution (see Materials and

interpretation that the peak indeed represents the optimized regulatory space. We obtained a similar size of
optimized regulatory space using 5’UTR median length
published in [20] (Figure 4, grey vertical line). Not surprisingly, this optimized distance (140 + 68*2 = 276 bp)

is somewhat longer than the minimal space of 172 bp we
identified in S. cerevisiae, which represents the lower
limit of a functional promoter space.
What is puzzling is that in two species, S. cerevisiae
and K. waltii, some evolutionarily young gene pairs get

Subtracting the mean length of promoter-less inter-CDS
regions in each species (Table 1) results in an estimate
of minimal promoter length of 54-225 bp. Note that the
average size of promoterless convergent regions has a
similar coefficient of variation across species (standard
deviation/mean = 0.35) as uni-directional (0.32) and bidirectional regions (0.30); this similarity suggests that
the observed differences across species may reflect different patterns of genome evolution rather than differences in promoter organisation. Thus, yeast promoters
appear to require a minimal length of 115 ± 50 bp,
regardless of whether they initiate transcription on one
or on both strands.

Figure 4 Minimal length is shorter than the optimized
regulatory space. Shown here is the length distribution of
divergent regions in S. cerevisiae that are conserved in other yeast
species. The minimal length of 172 bp is defined by the lower limit
of the length distribution (Table 1) and plotted in red; the
coincidence of the first peak with a canonical promoter space of
140 plus two times of median length of 5’UTRs (blue vertical line)
defines putative optimized regulatory space and is longer than the
minimal distance. This optimized space is slightly shorter if it’s
calculated using another source of 5’UTR median length (grey
vertical line) [20] but still longer than 172 bp.

away with much shorter promoter regions (Figure 1).
These are not pseudogenes, as there is unequivocal evidence for their expression (data not shown). It is conceivable that despite some functional impairment, these
recently created short promoter regions might still provide a selective advantage (e.g., by elevating co-expression between neighbours, or by disturbing the
expression of one gene by its neighbour [7,21]); in this
case, we would expect the promoter regions to grow
over time to allow better transcription initiation and/or
regulation. Conversely, it is possible that the short promoter regions present in the published genome
sequences are in fact slightly deleterious; they may have
survived due to population expansions (as during the
co-evolution of S. cerevisiae with human agriculture), or
they may even be polymorphic in the respective
populations.

Conclusion
In this study we show that the minimal chromosomal
space is required for transcriptional regulation in yeast
species; while the minimal length varies between yeast
species, this variation is relatively small. The position of
the left edge of the distribution varies between 78 bp
and 255 bp (Figure 1, Additional file 1, and Table 1).

Methods
Sequences and inter-CDS regions

We downloaded protein sequences and genome annotations for eleven yeast species (Kluyveromyces lactis , Ashbya gossypii, Saccharomyces kluyveri, Kluyveromyces
waltii, Kluyveromyces thermotolerans, Zygosaccharomyces
rouxii, Kluyveromyces polysporus, Candida glabrata, Saccharomyces castellii, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces bayanus) from the Yeast Gene Order Browser
[9,10]. We defined neighbouring gene pairs as proteincoding genes that are direct chromosomal neighbours,
with no intervening genes and no overlap of the transcripts. We grouped gene pairs (and the intervening
inter-CDS regions) into one of three types according to
the relative orientations of the genes: convergent (®¬),
uni-directional (®® or ¬¬), and divergent (¬®) [2].
We calculated inter-CDS distances using open-reading
frame (ORF) boundaries. We identified putative tandem
duplication genes based on BLAST searches and removed
those pairs with bitscore ≥50.
Age of inter-CDS regions

We used INPARANOID [22] to identify pairwise orthologous relationships for protein sequences between any
two yeast genomes, and retained orthologous groups
with 100% bootstrap support for subsequent analysis.
For each of the 11 species, we then searched ancestral
inter-CDS regions in the other 10 species. We considered a region conserved only if both flanking genes had
orthologs in the other genome, and if those orthologs
were also direct neighbours in the same orientation; the
corresponding inter-CDS regions were then considered
orthologs.
To reconstruct the phylogenic relationships among
downloaded yeast species, we selected ~40 universal single-copy marker genes previously suggested by Ref. [23],
and aligned each ortholog set using MUSCLE [24]. We
concatenated the resulting multiple-sequence alignments,
elimated poorly aligned and divergent regions using
Gblocks [25], and then used the maximum-likelihood

approach implemented in PHYML [26] to reconstruct
the phylogenetic tree. We used the parameters described
in Ref. [23] for all programs. To root the tree, we used
Schizosaccharomyces pombe [27] as an outgroup; we
downloaded its protein sequences from Sanger (http://
www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/S_pombe/) in April 2010. The
resulting tree is shown in Additional file 3.
We then classified the inter-CDS regions in S. cerevisiae
into four age groups, according to the most distal genomes
in which conserved neighbourhood was found. ‘young’
regions are those without conservation in any other species; ‘plain old’ (PO) are regions with orthologs in S. bayanus or S. castellii; ‘very old’ (VO) are regions with
orthologs in any of C. glabrata, K. polysporus and
Z. rouxii; and ‘extra old’ (XO) are those regions with
orthologs in any of K. thermotolerans, K. waltii, S. kluyveri,
A. gossypii and K. lactis (see Additional file 3 for more
detailed information on their phylogenetic relationships).

each pair, we calculate the probability that it will be broken up in the given time interval as P = p × length
(Model B: effective length); then we draw a random number r between 0 and 1 and put the pair into a list of ‘surviving’ pairs if r <P. We repeat this simulation until the
final list contains Nold regions. The complete simulation
is repeated 10 times, and the simulated length distributions shown are averaged over the 10 simulation runs.

Modelling long-term genome rearrangements

Intergene distance is by far the strongest predictor of gene
neighbourhood conservation in S. cerevisiae [8]. This is
consistent with a simple neutral model in which rearrangements are equally likely at each inter-CDS nucleotide.
We performed simulations to test if this model is sufficient
to explain the difference in the length distributions of
young and ancestral inter-CDS regions even when ignoring other factors contributing to length evolution.
We used two versions of the model: in Model A (results
shown in Additional file 6), the probability that a neighbouring gene pair is broken up depends only on the total
distance between the coding sequences. In Model B
(shown in the main text), we assume that rearrangements
within the promoter region are strongly deleterious, and
that rearrangements therefore only occur at nucleotides
outside the promoter region. To approximate this effect,
we assume that rearrangement probability is proportional
to the length of the inter-CDS region minus the minimal
promoter length in Table 1 (’corrected’ length).
In a given genome, we have Ntotal = Nyoung + Nold interCDS regions. On the terminal branch of the phylogenetic
tree, Nyoung new pairs were formed by breaking up the
same number of ancestral (old) pairs. We assume that the
inter-CDS length distribution is in equilibrium, i.e., the
length distribution at the ancestral node was identical to
the total length distribution observed now. We then set
the probability that each inter-CDS nucleotide becomes
the point of a rearrangement to p := Nyoung divided by the
sum of all inter-CDS lengths (Model B: p := Nyoung divided
by the sum of all corrected lengths).
We start with the complete set of all Ntotal inter-CDS
regions (assumed to describe the length distribution in
the ancestor that divides old from young regions). For
