Conclusions: This study shows a strongly conserved genomic distribution of OR genes between
dog and human, suggesting that OR genes evolved from a common mammalian ancestral repertoire
by successive duplications. In addition, the dog repertoire appears to have expanded relative to that
of humans, leading to the emergence of specific canine OR genes.

Olfactory receptor (OR) genes were first discovered in Rattus
norvegicus in 1991 by Buck and Axel [1]. They belong to the
G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily, which is character-

ized by seven hydrophobic transmembrane domains. In
mammalian genomes as many as 1,000 OR-encoding genes
are predicted, comprising 3-5% of the total gene content

Results: In this study, 817 novel canine OR sequences were identified, and 640 have been
characterized. Of the 661 characterized OR sequences, representing half of the canine repertoire,
18% are predicted to be pseudogenes, compared with 63% in human and 20% in mouse.
Phylogenetic analysis of 403 canine OR sequences identified 51 families, and radiation-hybrid
mapping of 562 showed that they are distributed on 24 dog chromosomes, in 37 distinct regions.
Most of these regions constitute clusters of 2 to 124 closely linked genes. The two largest clusters
(124 and 109 OR genes) are located on canine chromosomes 18 and 21. They are orthologous to
human clusters located on human chromosomes 11q11-q13 and HSA11p15, containing 174 and
115 ORs respectively.

Background: Olfactory receptors (ORs), the first dedicated molecules with which odorants
physically interact to arouse an olfactory sensation, constitute the largest gene family in
vertebrates, including around 900 genes in human and 1,500 in the mouse. Whereas dogs, like many
other mammals, have a much keener olfactory potential than humans, only 21 canine OR genes
have been described to date.

superfamily, also known as the olfactory subgenome [4]. Each
OR gene consists of a single coding exon of about 1 kilobase
(kb). Conserved regions that encode transmembrane
domains 3 (TM3) and 7 (TM7) have been used to design
degenerate oligonucleotides that are specific for the OR gene
superfamily. Using such primers, a number of OR gene
sequences have been cloned from several other mammalian
species such as human [5-7], mouse [8], dog (Canis familiaris) [9] and pig [10], as well as fishes and amphibians [1114]. The consensus sequence in Drosophila melanogaster is
distinct, and the coding region can be split by introns [15,16].
This is also the case in Caenorhabditis elegans, in which
some 600 chemoreceptor sequences have been found by systematic searches of the complete genome sequence [17,18].
By mining the genome sequence, more than 900 human OR
genes have been identified at more than 100 chromosomal
locations, on all human chromosomes except 20 and Y [7,19].
The proportion of pseudogenes is estimated to be at least 53%
[19], recalculated to 63% (this work) from the HORDE 39 version (Human Olfactory Receptor Data Exploratorium [20]).
In the mouse, approximately 1,400 OR genes have been identified at more than 40 chromosomal locations, on all but
chromosomes 12 and Y, with the fraction of pseudogenes estimated to be 20% [21,22]. At the outset of this work, only 21
canine OR sequences were present in GenBank [5,9,23].
Twelve of these were known to be expressed in the olfactory
epithelium [5,23], the other nine in dog testis [5,9]. Five of
these had been mapped using the RHDF5000 radiation
hybrid (RH) panel (RH dog fibroblasts, irradiated at a dose of
5,000 rad) [24,25]. The olfactory sensitivity of dogs is known
to be much higher than that of humans [26]. While the capacity of dogs for finding hidden objects (drugs, mines, truffles)
or buried people can be enhanced by intensive training, physiological reasons must also be considered. In addition to anatomic differences such as the size of the olfactory epithelium
surface - the canine olfactory epithelium is about 20 times as
large as in humans [27,28] - the number, diversity and
expression level of OR genes could also be considered as distinctive characteristics. To understand dogs' high olfactory
capability better, we investigated the dog olfactory repertoire
at the gene level, and have identified a total of 817 new canine

http://genomebiology.com/2003/4/12/R80

OR sequences. Of these, 180 were isolated by PCR-screening
of dog genomic DNA with degenerate oligonucleotides and
637 were retrieved from a 1.2-times sequence assembly of the
dog genome. To date, the number of known dog OR genes is
838.

Results
Identification of canine OR sequences
Canine OR sequences were cloned following PCR amplification of dog genomic DNA with a set of primers designed to
amplify various regions between TM3 and TM7. Using five
different primer pairs, 774 clones were obtained. Sequencing
showed a certain level of redundancy, with only 190 unique
sequences, of which 10 correspond to OR genes previously
identified [5,9,23]. A consensus sequence was derived from
an alignment of all known human OR sequences, and was
used to screen a database of sequences derived from 1.2-times
coverage of the dog genome. Fragments of 737 unique OR
genes were identified, of which 100 corresponded to PCRscreened ORs. This combination of approaches has provided
sequence information for 838 unique canine OR genes.

RH mapping of the OR sequences
Specific markers could be defined for 562 OR sequences that
were mapped on the RHDF5000 panel. Two-point analysis,
computed using the MultiMap software on the latest RH map
containing 3,270 markers [29], provided lod-scores with
neighboring markers. Details are available on the website
[30] and can also be found in Additional data file 1. As shown
in Figure 1, the dog OR sequences are spread over 24 of the 40
chromosomes (see Additional data file 3). Three RH groups,
containing 2, 2 and 11 OR sequences, were not attributed to
any chromosome, and eight OR markers remained unlinked.
The mapped OR genes are distributed over 37 chromosomal
regions, in 33 clusters of 2-124 genes, and four isolated OR
genes. Two canine chromosomes (17 and 29) contain only one
OR gene, 20 canine chromosomes contain 3 to 65, while two
canine chromosomes (18 and 21), contain 124 and 109 OR
genes respectively, and constitute the two largest clusters of
OR genes in the dog genome. These two chromosomes alone
contain 41% of the mapped canine OR sequences.

Characterization of OR pseudogenes
Following careful visual inspection of sequencing traces,
translation of OR nucleotide sequences showed an uninterrupted open reading frame (ORF) for 417 of 661 fully characterized OR sequences. For the other 244, apparent insertions,
deletions or substitutions caused frameshift mutations and/
or in-frame stop codons. However, by sequencing PCR products of 142 putative pseudogenes, each derived from several
DNA sources, 75 were confirmed as pseudogenes, and 67
were reclassified as genes. For the remaining 102 sequences,
the apparent mutations could not be checked owing to their
proximity to the sequence ends. Therefore, the status of these
sequences could only be inferred.
Among the sequences harboring a single mutation, only 30%
were confirmed as pseudogenes. Sequences with two, or more
than two, mutations were confirmed as pseudogenes in 72%
and 97% of cases respectively. For the 102 unverified
sequences, 81 have a single mutation, 12 have two mutations,
and 9 have more than two mutations. Considering the percentages found on checked sequences, the number of true
pseudogenes in these 102 sequences is estimated to be (81 ×
30%) + (12 × 72%) + (9 × 97%) = 42. This figure is likely to be
an overestimate, as apparent mutations that are close to the
ends of sequences are more likely to be due to sequencing
errors than those that are detected in the middle of the
sequencing traces.
Nevertheless, a conservative estimate for the number of pseudogenes in the fraction of analyzed ORs is 117 (75 + 42), or
approximately 18%. The OR sequences that were screened for
mutations represent only half of the complete ORFs. Consequently, the presence of additional mutations outside the
sequenced regions cannot be excluded. However, as a large
proportion of pseudogenes tend to contain several mutations
that are evenly distributed along their ORF, the probability of
mutation(s) located only in the non-sequenced regions is low.
Indeed, for 54 full-length OR sequences that were checked by
resequencing, we found only six pseudogenes (11%), with
numerous mutations spread throughout the ORF. In summary, the value of 18% pseudogenes is considered to be a conservative estimate.

Canine OR classification
For 403 OR canine sequences, the regions encompassing
TM2 and EC2 (140 amino acids) were aligned, and a phylogram was constructed ([30] and see Additional data file 4).
This identified 51 families and 202 subfamilies. In common
with human and mouse, the canine OR families are separated
into two classes. Classes I and II are composed of 10 and 41
families respectively. Each family contains between 1 and 35
genes, representing between 1 and 11 subfamilies.

Human OR classification
We retrieved 906 human OR sequences from the HORDE38
version [20]. Of these, 714 sequences, spanning the TM2 to

http://genomebiology.com/2003/4/12/R80

EC2 regions, were aligned and used to construct a phylogram
([30] and see Additional data file 5) using the same method as
for the canine OR sequences. We identified 61 families, separated in two classes as expected [19]; 10 families for class I,
and 51 families for class II. Families contain between 1 and 93
OR sequences, and are divided into a total of 285 subfamilies.
Interestingly, 111 subfamilies contain only pseudogenes.

Discussion

A first set of 180 novel ORs was identified after PCR-amplification of canine genomic DNA with degenerate primers. A
conserved motif was also used to retrieve fragments of 737 OR
genes from a database of whole-genome shotgun sequence
data. Using BLAST [31] this conserved motif identified 794 of
906 unique human OR genes (HORDE, version 39; p < 0.3).
Together with the estimated genome coverage of the canine
1.2-times shotgun sequence data (0.70), and the probability
of identifying a complete consensus sequence (45 bases)
within an average sequence read (576 bases; 0.92), it can be
estimated that the complete canine OR gene repertoire is
approximately 1,300 genes. This estimate is consistent with
the expansion of the canine repertoire relative to human, as
observed for some of the largest clusters (see below). The
canine OR sequences described here are derived from
approximately half of the canine OR repertoire, and are representative of the complete repertoire. This hypothesis is
reinforced by the phylogenetic analysis and mapping data
discussed below.

Canine and human OR pseudogenes
The present study showed that, in the fraction of canine ORs
analyzed, 18% are estimated to be pseudogenes - a similar
percentage to that found in the mouse OR repertoire (20%)
[22] but much lower than the 63% calculated from the
HORDE 39 version [20] for the human repertoire (our
present work). This feature could at least partly explain the
difference in olfaction between macrosmatic and microsmatic
species.
A detailed analysis of the distribution of the pseudogenes
throughout the canine genome showed that they are spread
over all chromosomes harboring OR sequences. In contrast to
a rather even distribution of pseudogenes within most of the
clusters, the two largest clusters on canine chromosomes 18
and 21 harbor only 4% and 10% pseudogenes, respectively. In
comparison, such a low fraction of pseudogenes was not
observed in the largest orthologous mouse clusters [22]. At
the family level, a rather uneven distribution of pseudogenes
was noted. Three families (named 16, 26 and 38) contain up
to 43% pseudogenes, while eight other families (named 6, 11,
18, 27, 32, 41, 42 and 51) harbor only 5% pseudogenes.
In humans, an overall even distribution is observed: small
clusters (< 10 genes) and isolated genes (totaling approximately 300 sequences) have a high level of pseudogenes

information

Thirty-three OR clusters, and four isolated genes, have been
identified in the canine genome. This compares with 80 clusters, and 62 isolated genes, in the human genome. The difference in cluster numbers is likely to be at least partly due to the
difference in the resolution of the two methodologies used for
their identification. Human clusters were defined after
genome sequencing, and any genes or group of genes separated by more than 1 megabase (Mb) were considered as independent clusters [19]. In contrast, the identification of canine
clusters is based on RH-mapping data. Consequently, in

interactions

Orthologous dog and human clusters

Despite the fact that only half the canine OR genes have been
identified, we frequently observed the presence of an equal or
higher number of genes in the canine clusters compared to
their human orthologous clusters (Table 1). In common with
mouse, this result reflects the existence of a larger canine repertoire relative to human. Two large canine clusters, located
on canine chromosome 20, are good examples of the human/
canine OR repertoire evolution. These two clusters, containing 21 and 44 sequences, have a similar composition, with
genes from families 16, 40 and 41, suggesting a cis-duplication. These two clusters correspond to two human orthologous clusters (19@12.2 and 19@19.8 [20]). However, these
human and canine clusters differ in two respects. First, the
two canine clusters contain more genes than their orthologous human clusters (44 and 21 in dog versus 14 and 14 in
human), another example of OR gene expansion in the canine
genome. Second, whereas canine gene family 41 is restricted
to canine chromosome 20, the orthologous human family is
scattered in 13 different chromosomes, with most of them
pseudogenes (see above). Thus, whereas in dog it appears that
only a cis-duplication event gave rise to two paralogous clusters, in human there appear to have been several additional
trans-duplication events. As in the dog genome, murine OR
genes of family 41 are all located on mouse chromosome 9, in
the region syntenic to that on canine chromosome 20.

refereed research

Apart from class I genes, which are all located on canine chromosome 21, gene families of more than five genes are in most
cases (17 families out of 22) scattered over several genomic
locations; for example, members of the canine-specific family
38, of which 17 genes are mapped, are dispersed over eight
chromosomal regions. In contrast, the 32 mapped sequences
of family 41 are all located on canine chromosome 20 (in two
clusters). At the level of subfamilies, and taking a threshold of
three mapped genes per subfamily, 77% are chromosome specific, and even cluster specific. This is similar to the 73%
found with the human classification made in the present
work.

Evolution of the OR repertoire

deposited research

Canine OR families and canine clusters

On the basis of synteny data and nucleotide sequence similarity, dog and human clusters were paired whenever possible,
resulting in the pairing of 20 canine clusters to 29 human
clusters. Surprisingly, no human orthologous clusters were
found for 13 canine clusters, containing 2-16 genes. Apart for
the three canine clusters attributed to unlinked RH groups,
and for which no synteny information could be used, the
other 10 canine clusters appear to be dog specific. Two of
these are located on each of canine chromosomes 10 and 15,
and one on each of chromosomes 1, 3, 6, 8, 30 and X. Interestingly, there are no OR clusters in the human orthologous
regions of canine chromosomes 1, 3, 8, 15, 30 and X, or in the
mouse orthologous regions of canine chromosomes 1, 3, 6, 8,
10, 30 and X. This indicates locations where canine-specific
expansion of the OR repertoire has occurred. Among those,
clusters on chromosomes 3, 8 and 10 contain members of
canine-specific family 38.

reports

For comparison of the two classifications, we constructed a
phylogram containing both human sequences (714) and
canine sequences (403). Generally, human and canine families are intermingled with class I and class II branches well
separated (see Additional data file 6). For class I, no human
or dog families appear to be species specific. In contrast, for
class II, one dog family (number 38), which contains 26
sequences and is spread over chromosomes 3, 8, 10, 27 and
29, appears to be dog specific as no human counterpart has
been found. On this phylogram, one human family (number
41, named 7 by Glusman et al. [19]) is particularly large, containing 93 OR sequences as compared to 35 in the dog. This
family was shown to have expanded in humans and to consist
of a large number of pseudogenes [19].

many cases, a canine cluster can correspond to several human
clusters. In addition, owing to the complete identification of
the human OR repertoire, several small human clusters presently have no canine counterpart. This is likely to reflect the
fact that only half of the canine repertoire has been identified
and the probability of having mapped isolated genes or small
clusters is lower than for larger clusters. As already noted for
the mouse OR repertoire [22], it seems clear that there are far
more isolated genes in the human genome than in the mouse
and canine genomes.

reviews

The higher number of human subfamilies observed in the
phylograms (285 in human versus 202 in dog) is partly due to
the higher number of human pseudogenes that are evolving
more rapidly than functional genes, and tend to be fractionated into specific subfamilies (see Additional data file 5). In
addition, the number of canine subfamilies is likely to
increase as the full repertoire of canine genes is identified.

(78%), whereas the largest clusters on human chromosome 11
contain 56% pseudogenes (compared with a mean value of
63% for the whole repertoire). The pseudogene distribution
within families is relatively uniform, except for family 41
(named family 7 by Glusman et al. [19]), which contains 87%
pseudogenes.

manually in specific regions of the query sequence (see Additional data file 2) and were then submitted to the program
Primer3 [38]. RH mapping was performed on the
RHDF5000 radiation hybrid panel as described previously
[24]. To ensure that a given mapped marker actually corresponds to the gene sequence from which the primers had
been derived, PCR products from two positive hybrid cell
lines, as well as from the positive dog DNA control, were
sequenced and compared with the original clone sequence.
Statistical analysis of the RH data was performed using the
MultiMap package [39] as described in Mellersh et al. [40].

information

Dog DNA was extracted from the MDCK cell line as described
previously [25]. A PCR amplification mix was made from 25
ng dog DNA, 0.5 U AmpliTaq Gold polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), 1.2 µM of each degenerate
primer (OR3p [5], OR5A, OR5B, OR3B [6], OR3.1, OR7.1
[12]), 0.25 mM of each dNTP (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA), 1x buffer and 3 mM MgCl2 for OR3.1 and
OR7.1 primers or 2 mM MgCl2 for the others primers in a final
volume of 50 µl. PCR cycling conditions were 40 cycles at
94°C for 30 sec, 45°C (or 35°C) for 45 sec, 72°C for 1 min, with

A database of canine genomic sequence is maintained by The
Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR). Sequence data was
originally obtained from plasmid libraries of small (2 kb) and
medium-sized (10 kb) genomic DNA inserts prepared from a
male standard poodle, and sequenced at Celera Genomics, as
described previously for the human genome [35]. The
sequence data consists of 6.2 million reads (average read
length, 576 bases), representing approximately 1.2x sequence
coverage of the haploid canine genome (3 Gb [36]). The reads
were assembled with Celera Assembler [35], and the assembly output consisted of 1.09 million contigs (mean length
1,393 bases; mean content 4.9 reads per contig) and 0.85 million singletons. These were searched for sequences that
encode peptides that share similarity with the conserved peptide sequence, MAYDRYVAICXPLHY (single-letter aminoacid code), using tblastn (p < 0.3). Selected assemblies, or
unassembled reads, were then searched against the nr
sequence database of GenBank. Canine sequences that were
more similar to known ORs than to any other classes of gene
were selected for further analysis.

Materials and methods

PCR products were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and cloned using the pCR 2.1TOPO Vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Clones were transferred from agar plates into 96-well microplates containing
PCR mix. PCR of inserts was performed in a final volume of
20 µl using PU and PR primers (1.2 µM each), 1U Taq
polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI), 0.25 mM of each dNTP,
1x buffer and 2 mM MgCl2. Amplification was checked by
electrophoresis in a 2%-agarose gel in 0.5x TBE. Inserts were
sequences using PU and PR primers and the Dye-T chemistry
on an ABI prism 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA). The sequences were analyzed by the Phred/
Phrap and Consed software [32-34].

deposited research

As we have shown here, the dog OR repertoire appears to be
around 30% larger than in humans, and has a much lower
percentage of pseudogenes. This could increase the number
of functional OR genes in dogs versus humans by approximately twofold - a parameter that is likely to contribute to the
wider range of odorant molecules that can be detected by
dogs.

Cloning and sequencing

reports

Several elements such as the size of the olfactory epithelium,
the density of neuronal cells and the number of ORs that they
express on their surface, as well as the size of the olfactory
bulb, have to be taken into consideration when comparing the
sensory capacities of different mammals. The dog olfactory
epithelium, although variable in size between different
breeds, can express up to 20 times more ORs than that of
humans. Undoubtedly, this contributes to the ability of dogs
to detect odorant molecules at a much lower concentration
[26,27]. In addition to the anatomical differences, one could
hypothesize differences at the level of transcription, such as
the use of different transcription 5' start points and/or the
implications of splicing events affecting the 5' untranslated
region. The binding affinity of odorant molecules for their
cognate OR is also likely to be an important variable that
could explain both the difference in sensing abilities between
human and dogs, and within dog breeds (if they express different alleles of the same OR). Unfortunately, no information
is yet available on the extent of OR allelic polymorphisms.

Conclusions

Quignon et al. R80.7

comment

This can be seen as a consequence of the fact that the same
cluster organization exists in the human and dog genomes,
and when several clusters are localized on the same chromosome they tend to be in close proximity, thus forming a region
of limited size whose synteny was not disrupted during evolution. In all, the present study shows a similar clustered
genomic organization of OR genes in dog, mouse and human,
raising the question of the relative importance of gene
number, pseudogenization and gene transcription regulation
to explain the greater olfactory capacity of macrosmatic
mammals (mouse and dog) versus a microsmatic mammal
(human).

Characterization of the sequences
Sequences were translated using the program 'Traduction
multiple' at the Infobiogen site [41]. Pseudogenes were scored
when frameshift(s) and/or in-frame stop codon(s) were
observed. When possible, mutation(s) were verified on different DNA samples (MDCK cell line, fibroblasts used to construct the RH panel, and mongrel dog lymphocytes).

Classification of the OR sequences
Alignment of dog OR protein sequences between TM2 and
EC2 was performed with CLUSTALW [42] using standard
parameters. Pseudogenes were also included after artificial
elimination of the frameshift mutations to restore the ORFs.
The dog b3-adrenergic receptor sequence (GenBank U92468)
was used as outgroup and for rooting. The phylogram was
constructed using the neighbor-joining method implemented
in CLUSTALW. The sequences were classified in families and
subfamilies using the criteria of Ben-Arie et al. [6]; that is, a
family is defined as a group of sequences with greater than
40% amino-acid sequence identity (ASI), and a subfamily
with greater than 60% ASI.
