Abstract
The human papillomavirus type 16 E5 protein (HPV16 E5) is 83 amino acids in length and contains
three well-defined hydrophobic regions. The protein is expressed at very limited amounts in
transfected cells and the absence of specific antibodies has strongly hampered functional analyses.
To investigate the relationship between structure and function we have synthesized a codonadapted version of the gene (hE5) and prepared a series of N-terminal and C-terminal deletions.
Immunofluorescence analyses show colocaliation of the protein with calnexin, an ER marker, EEA1, an early endosomes marker, and Lamp-2, a lysosomal marker. No major colocalization was found
between hE5 and the Golgi marker 58 K. Whereas deletions at the C-terminal end of the protein
do not greatly alter the localisation pattern, deletion of the first hydrophobic region results in loss
of colocalisation with the ER, early endosomes and lysosomes. Further, we show that while the
complete E5 protein confers to HaCaT cells the property to grow in an anchorage-independent
manner, deletion of the first hydrophobic region results in loss of growth in soft agar. We conclude
that the first hydrophobic region of the E5 protein largely determines the biological properties of
the viral protein.

Background
Certain papillomaviruses (PVs) present a coding region
between the E2 and L2 open reading frames. The proteins
herein encoded are usually named E5, although they can
be classified into four different types according to their
phylogeny and to their correlation with abnormal growth
[1]. HPV16 E5 is the prototype of the E5-α group, and is
the most investigated E5 protein. The HPV16 E5 is 83

amino acids in length and mainly localises in the Golgi
apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum [2-4].
The cellular effects associated to the expression of
HPV16E5 are multiple [5]. Experimental work has demonstrated that HPV16 E5 binds the 16 K proteolipid subunit of the membrane proton pump, although this
binding does not appear to be responsible for the E5mediated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overPage 1 of 10

Virology Journal 2008, 5:30

activation [4,6,7]. The binding region has been mapped to
amino acids 54 to 78 [8] or to amino acids 41 to 54 of the
E5 protein [7], and in both cases this binding was unrelated to the overactivation of the EGFR. In addition, data
have been published showing that HPV16 E5 binds the
platelet-derived growth factor as well as the EGF receptors,
although contradictory results have been reported [9,10].
Regarding the interaction of the E5 proteins with the
immune system, it has been proposed that its expression
blocks the transport of the major histocompatibility complexes to the cell surface [11,12], either by direct interaction with the heavy chain of the human leucocitary
antigen molecule [13] or indirectly via interaction with
calnexin [14]. Finally, it has been suggested that many of
the multiple and disparate effects associated to E5 could
eventually arise from modifications in membrane composition and dynamics subsequent to protein expression
[15].
The strong hydrophobicity of the protein and the absence
of valuable specific antibodies have hampered E5
research. Most of the experimental work with the protein
has been performed using a tagged gene and antibodies to
the ligated epitope. In addition, the rare use of the viral
codons by mammalian cells makes expression of the protein very weak, thus difficulting the identification of the
epitope-tagged proteins as well as the analysis of its putative biological effects. In most cases, expression has been
limited to the demonstration of the corresponding RNA
[16]. For these reasons, the group led by Schlegel synthesized an E5 gene adapting the codon usage to that found
in mammalian cells [17]. Using this "codonadapted" gene
they observed a strong expression of the protein and
found that the protein mainly localised in the endoplasmic reticulum [17]. This contrasts with other published
results using the "wild-type" codons showing a clear colocalisation of the E5 protein with markers specific for the
Golgi apparatus [2].
Hydropathic analysis of the protein reveals three hydrophobic regions [1], the first being considered to be the
putative transmembrane region, although no experimental work has so far demonstrated this point (see [18] for
BPV1 E5). At the HPV16 E5 C-terminal end, a short
hydrophilic tract seems to be involved in protein-protein
associations and also to be responsible for the activity of
the viral protein towards the EGF receptor [7,8].
We have performed a series of experiments aiming to analyse the correlation between the primary structure of the
protein and its cellular localisation and biological function. For this, deletions encompassing fragments of the Nterminal or C-terminal ends of the E5 protein were constructed, and the cellular localisation and biological
effects of these modified genes were analysed. Our results

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/30

indicate that the first hydrophobic region of HPV16 E5
determines the subcellular localisation of the protein,
despite no canonic localisation signal can be identified.
Finally, cells transformed with the full-length HPV16 E5
gene were able to grow in an anchorage-independent
manner, whereas transformants lacking the first hydrophobic domain do not grow in soft agar.

3.1 Results
3.1. Preparation of recombinants and expression of the
proteins
A recombinant containing the human codon-adapted
sequence of HPV16 E5 (hE5), an α-type E5 protein [1]
(EF463082) was cloned into the vector pFlag-CMV4
(Sigma). Cloning was performed deleting the methionine
start codon of the viral protein and ligating the rest of the
E5 gene the vector Flag epitope. The HPV16 E5 protein is
83 amino acids long, with three well-defined hydrophobic regions (Fig. 1). In an initial series of experiments, we
produced series of deletions starting at the first viral
amino acid after methionine and with stop codons at
amino acids histidine 75 (hE5H75), arginine 58
(hE5R58), or arginine 30 (hE5R30). N-terminal deletions
were prepared starting at amino acids 30 (R30hE5) or 58
(R58hE5) and ending at amino acid 83.

To analyse expression of the protein mutants, HEK-293T
cells were transfected with pFlag-CMV4 recombinants and
24 hours later protein extracts were prepared. The proteins
were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and
blotted with antiflag antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2, all
recombinants were expressed in HEK-293Tcells albeit
with different efficiencies. Whereas deletion hE5R58 was
strongly expressed, deletion R30hE5 was expressed at
much lower levels. No protein could be observed using
deletion R58hE5. Results concerning this mutant will
therefore not be considered in this manuscript.
These results were reproducible when using different DNA
batches and performing the transfections on different
days, suggesting that the differences observed among the
deletions are of intrinsic nature and not experimental artefacts.
3.2. Cellular localisation of wild-type and mutant E5α
proteins
It has been reported that, when expressed from a codonadapted gene, the E5α protein is mostly localised at the
endoplasmic reticulum [17]. To identify the cellular compartment where the deletions were located, we used
immunofluorescence colocalisation experiments via specific antibodies against markers for the Golgi apparatus
(58 K), the early endosomes (EEA-1), the endoplasmic
reticulum (calnexin), and the lysosomes (LAMP-2).

cloned into the Eco Rl-Bam Hl restriction sites of the vector pFlag-CMV4. In all cases the start methionine amino acid was
deleted. All recombinants were confirmed by sequencing.

In full-length transfectants carrying the codon-adapted
version of the gene a strong colocalisation with calnexin
was found (Fig. 3A), consistenly with previous reports
[14]. This contrasts with the distribution detected when
the full-length gene carrying the viral codons was transfected. In this case almost no colocalisation with calnexin
was observed (Fig. 4), also consistently with previous
reports [2]. Further, all Cterminal deletions showed a
strong colocalisation with calnexin. Surprisingly, no colocalisation was found between the N-terminal mutant
R30hE5 and calnexin, indicating that the mutant protein
is not localised in the ER (Fig. 3B).
Our immunofluorescence analyses further demonstrate
that neither the codonadapted full-length gene nor any of
the codon-adapted deletion mutants colocalised with the
58 K marker for the trans-Golgi (Fig. 3A, B, Fig. 5). This

again contrasts with the picture observed when the fulllength viral gene was transfected, where colocalisation of
E5 and 58 K was observed (Fig. 4).
Clear colocalisation with EEA-1 was found for both the
full-length gene and the Cterminal deletions, indicating
the presence of the protein in the early endosomes.
Finally, a strong colocalisation of the wild type protein
and deletion hE5H75 with Lamp-2 was observed, suggesting that degradation of the protein -or at least of this particular deletion- takes place in the lysosomes (Fig. 5).
Interestingly, no colocalisation with any of the markers
used could be demonstrated for mutant R30hE5 (Fig. 3B),
despite the clear expression of the protein as demonstrated in the Western blots (see Fig. 2). The immunofluorescence pictures suggest that this mutant protein is
associated to some membranous structures and not ran-

domly distributed in the cytosol (Fig. 3B). A summary of
the immunofluorescence data is shown in table 1.
3.3. Growth in soft agar
Expression of HPV16-E5 in primary keratinocytes from a
codon-adapted gene does not result in alterations of ligand-mediated EGFR phosphorylation, PI 3-K or c-Src activation but promotes anchorage-independent growth in
soft agar [19]. Thus, we chose keratinocyte growth in soft
agar as a read-out for the biological activity of the protein
and the corresponding deletions. HaCaT cells were transduced with retroviruses carrying the complete gene or the
different deletions, plated onto soft agar, and 21 days later
colony number and size were scored. The values obtained
for colony size followed a exponential decrease-like distribution, but could not be properly fitted to any reasonably
simple function (an example is shown in Fig. 6C). We
have therefore addresed the statistic comparisons by
means of robust estimators (Huber estimator for central
tendency and median absolute deviation for dispersion)
and by means of robust comparisons (Wilcoxon-MannWithney test).

Non-transduced HaCaT cells were only marginally able to
grow under non-adhesive conditions, confirming published reports [20]. An interesting observation in this
experiment was that both genes, codon-adapted and original viral codons, stimulated growth in soft agar to similar
extents, despite the differences in protein expression and
in subcellular localisation. As shown in Fig. 6, the fulllength genes as well as the deletions investigated, with the
exception of deletion R30hE5, increased the number of
colonies and the colony size of keratinocytes growing in
soft agar. The effect of the empty vector on colony formation was noteworthy. As shown in Fig. 6A, HaCaT cells
transduced with the empty pLXSN retroviral vector were
able to form colonies in softagar, albeit the size did not
differ from the untransduced controls (p = 0.1121, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test).
Analysis of the colony size revealed that cells transduced
with a codon-adapted E5 gene were larger than cells transduced with the wild-type gene (p = 3.285e-3, WilcoxonMann-Whitney test) (Fig. 6B). All three codon-adapted Cterminal deletions induced also the growth of larger colo-

nies than the wild-type gene, and showed no statistical
significant differences in size compared to the full-length
codon-adapted transductants. Finally, the few colonies
grown after transduction with the N-terminal deletion
hR30E5 were did not differ in size from control HaCaT
cells (p = 0.907, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test).
In summary, keratinocytes transduced with constructs
encompassing the first hydrophobic region of HPV16 E5
showed increased growth under anchorageindependent
conditions. Furthermore, full-length codon-adapted
transductants gave rise to more colonies and to larger colonies than full-length wild-type HPV16 E5 transductants.

4. Discussion
In this communication we present experimental evidence
demonstrating expression in HEK-293T cells of a codonadapted version of the HPV16 E5α protein, as well as of a
series of N- or C-terminal deletions. Expression of mutant
protein hR58E5 could not be demonstrated in western
blots. Whether the failure to identify expression of this
mutant is due to inherent protein instability is unknown.

Immunofluorescence experiments with markers specific
for different cellular compartments show colocalisation of
HPV16 hE5α with calnexin, indicating that the protein is
mainly localised at the endoplasmic reticulum. This finding is in agreement with previous results obtained also
using codon-adapted versions of the E5 gene [14,17].
Interestingly, these results contrast with published reports
showing the protein mainly associated with the Golgi
apparatus [2,3]. It must be noted however that the initial
reports refer to genes encoding the original, non-humanadapted viral codons. A possible explanation for this difference may lie in the large amounts of E5 protein synthesised from the codon-adapted genes, which will probably
accumulate in the ER with the cell being unable to further
transport the protein to the Golgi compartment. Similar
remarkable shifts in cellular localisation and/or function
have also been reported for the L1 [21], E6 [22] and E7
[23] proteins from different PVs after humanisation of the
codon usage. Experimental differences between the effects
of the expression of wild-type and humanised PV genes
highlights again the physiological importance of the
biased codon usage in PVs [24,25]. The colocalisation

demonstrated for E5α with the early endosomal marker
EEA-1 is most interesting since a physical association
between HPV16 E5α and the 16 K subunit of the proton
ATPase has already been demonstrated. This association
has been made responsible for the modulation of the

internal pH value of the endosomes [4,6]. In addition, the
presence of HPV16 E5α in early endosomes is in agreement with the functional observation of an E5-dependent
pH alteration in endosomes, as previously described
[17,26].

Figure localisation of hE5 protein and deletions expressed from codon-adapted genes
Cellular 5
Cellular localisation of hE5 protein and deletions expressed from codon-adapted genes. HaCaT cells were transfected with the complete gene or with the deletions hE5H75, hE5R30 or R30hE5. Colocalization with markers specific for
Golgi (58 K, pictures b, c), early endosomes (EEA1, pictures e, f) or lysosomes (Lamp-1, pictures h, i) was analysed by double
immunofluorescence. Overlays are shown in pictures c, f and I, respectively.

The observation that the presence of the first hydrophobic
region is necessary for localisation of the protein to the
ER, early endosomes or lysosomes is noteworthy, mainly
because of the lack of a canonical signal peptide. Deletion
of the first 30 amino acids (recombinant R30hE5) results
in changes in both localisation pattern and biological
effects of the protein. This mutant showed no loss colocalisation of the Flag epitope with 58 K, calnexin, EEA-1 or
Lamp-2. Moreover, in the anchorageindependent growth
experiments this mutant strongly inhibited colony growth
and the size of the few growing colonies was clearly
reduced in comparison with that of the full length gene.
Further, the immunofluorescence pictures showed a
punctuated distribution for this mutant, suggesting that

the protein was associated with some kind of vesicular
structure, although we were not able to identifiy it.
The results shown in this communication demonstrate
that the expression of theHPV16 E5 protein increases the
number and the size of HaCaT cell colonies growing in
soft-agar. The results were the same for both the wild-type
version of the E5 gene and for a codon-optimised version,
despite strong differences in expression intensity between
these two genes. This suggests that the amount of
expressed E5 protein is not decisive for colony number
but determines the number of cells and therefore the colony size (see Fig. 6). The data here detailed represent the
first quantitative description of the ability of HPV16 E5 to

Page 8 of 10

Virology Journal 2008, 5:30

promote growth in soft agar. A previous qualitative
description in the same sense had been provided by
Suprynowicz and coworkers, in primary keratinocytes
[19]. The effects of HPV16 E5 on uncontrolled cell growth
and malignisation seem therefore to be multiple. Thus,
although an increased expression of the protein seems to
shorten the in vitro life span of primary keratinocytes
[17], the expression of HPV16 E5 allows human keratinocytes to grow in soft agar ([19] and the present paper).
Finally, as a correlate at the organismic level, the expression of HPV16 E5 in transgenic mice leads to the development of endophytic papillomas, precursors to
carcinomas, and contributes to the promotion and progression stages of carcinogenesis [27].
Regarding the dissection of the differential implication of
the three transmembrane domains of HPV16 E5 in the
biological effects of the protein, our finding that Nterminal deletion mutant R30hE5 was unable to promote
growth in soft-agar is interesting since this mutant did not
show colocalisation with any of the markers used in our
immunofluorescence experiments. The molecular mechanisms responsible for this effect are unknown. Computer
analysis of the protein identifies the first hydrophobic
region of HPV16 E5 as a putative trans-membrane segment [1,28]. It may be speculated that interactions of with
other membrane proteins determine the biological activity of the viral protein. This is further supported by
recently published work showing that E5 interacts in the
ER with calnexin through the first hydrophobic segment
[14]. This interaction results in retention of the HLA class
I molecules in the Golgi apparatus, with concomitant
down-regulation of its plasma membrane expression
[11,13,14].
Thus, we can conclude that the first 30 amino acids of the
HPV16 E5α protein play a crucial role in the biological
properties of the protein. This region determines cellular
localisation of the protein, binding to the chaperone calnexin, and anchorageindependent growth in a human
keratinocyte cell line.

Materials and methods
Recombinants
The nucleotide sequence of the codon-adapted HPV16 E5
gene was synthesized in vitro adapting the wild type
codons to the human codon usage (GeneArt, Regensburg), and the corresponding sequence has been deposited in GenBank under EF463082. The full-length gene
and deletions encompassing different fragments of the
protein were cloned into the Eco RI-Bam Hl sites of
recombinant pLXSN (Fig. 1). For immunofluorescence
and western blot experiments, hE5 sequences were cloned
into the vector pFlag-CMV4. For comparing subcellular
distribution of the codon-adapted genes and the original

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/30

viral sequence, a GFP-E5 fusion recombinant was synthesized by ligating the E5 wild-type coding region to the Cterminal end of the green fluorescence protein gene of the
pEGFP vector [3].
2.2. Cell culture, transfections, and transductions
HaCaT cells, an immortalized human keratinocyte cell
line, were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10 %
FCS and antibiotics. Transfections with the pCMV4
recombinants were performed using Lipofectamine 2000
as indicated by the manufacturer. 24–48 hours after transfection the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Double immunofluorescence was performed using polyclonal
antibodies against the Flag tag, and monoclonal antibodies against the 58 K Golgi protein (Sigma-Aldrich), endoplasmatic reticulum marker calnexin (Santa Cruz), the
lysosomal marker LAMP-2 (antibody H4B4, University of
Ohio) and the early endosomal marker EEA-1 (Transduction Laboratories). Pictures were obtained using a confocal microscope LEICA DMRBE.

For the analysis of protein expression, recombinants were
transfected into HEK-293T cells. 24 hours after transfection protein extracts were prepared and immunobloted
with antibodies to the Flag epitope. Reacting bands were
revealed with ECL.
HaCaT cells were transduced with retroviruses as
described [29]. In brief, retroviruses were generated in
Phoenix cells transfected with the corresponding recombinants. The cell supernatants containing the retroviruses
were used to transduce HaCaT cells in the presence of
polybrene. After 24 hours growth, 800 μg/mL of the selection antibiotic G-418 were added and the cells were further cultured for the desired time.
2.3. Anchorage-independent growth
The growth characteristics of transduced HaCaT cells
under anchorage-independent conditions were analysed
by growing the cells in soft agar. 2 × 104, 5 × 104 or 105
cells transduced with the corresponding retroviral constructs were suspended in 2× MEM containing 20 % FCS
and mixed with the same volume of 0.7% agar at 42°C.
Cells were plated onto 0.5% agar in medium and then
overlayed with 200 μL of medium containing G-418 (800
μg/μL) and 50 ng/mL EGF. Each point was performed
twice in triplicate. The experiment was repeated twice
using different retroviral supernatants and different keratinocyte cultures. Each point thus gathers information
from at least 12 agar plates. Colony number and size were
scored after 3 weeks growth, using crystal violet staining
and the ImageQuant software (Amersham). Due to the
non-normal distribution of the colony size, the robust
Huber estimator was used for central tendency. Comparison among colony size values was performed with the
