Abstract
Background: The availability of sequences from whole genomes to reconstruct the tree of life has
the potential to enable the development of phylogenomic hypotheses in ways that have not been
before possible. A significant bottleneck in the analysis of genomic-scale views of the tree of life is
the time required for manual curation of genomic data into multi-gene phylogenetic matrices.
Results: To keep pace with the exponentially growing volume of molecular data in the genomic
era, we have developed an automated technique, ASAP (Automated Simultaneous Analysis
Phylogenetics), to assemble these multigene/multi species matrices and to evaluate the significance
of individual genes within the context of a given phylogenetic hypothesis.
Conclusion: Applications of ASAP may enable scientists to re-evaluate species relationships and
to develop new phylogenomic hypotheses based on genome-scale data.

Background
In the post-genomic era, the necessity of developing automated methods for the construction and updating of
matrices for complete genome-level phylogenetic analyses
of the tree of life have been acknowledged [1]. However,
to date a solution for automating gene partition based
approaches has been lacking. The main impetus for automated phylogenetic matrix construction is related to the
fact that contemporary phylogenetic matrices used to
approach the tree of life experience "growing pains" in
two dimensions as a result of modern genomics: first, the
number of taxa with sequence information "grows" and
second the number of data partitions or kinds of genome

sequence information "grows" as partial or full genome
sequences of species become available.
Several bottlenecks exist in the data acquisition pipeline
that can prevent easy construction and updating of phylogenetic matrices. Matrix assembly at the genome scale
involves the acquisition (through sequencing or download from databases) of hundreds to thousands of gene
regions for the taxa of interest, the formatting of these
sequences for use in an alignment program, aligning
them, and finally the export of the data partitions into formats used by phylogenetic analysis packages. A phylogenetic analysis package (such as PAUP* [2]) can then be
used to infer the phylogenetic tree from the combined

matrix. To automate matrix assembly and facilitate the
calculation of character-based assessments of tree reliability relative to each of the constituent data partitions, we
have developed the Automated Simultaneous Analysis
Phylogenetics (ASAP) tool.
While separate analysis of individual gene regions has
been used to identify conflicting gene regions, e.g.
through the calculation of incongruent length differences
[3,4], to suggest their exclusion from a combined analysis,
the examination of hidden support in the context of a
simultaneous analysis has shown that even these "conflicting" gene regions have hidden support for the simultaneous analysis tree [1,5,6]. ASAP can be used to perform
a number of the requisite analyses to calculate hidden
support through the generation and execution of PAUP*
command. The approach begins by first performing a heuristic tree search for the simultaneous analysis tree. Effective search of tree space for large matrices would
preferably be implemented (e.g., using the parsimony
ratchet [7]) and there are plans to incorporate such methods into future versions of ASAP. After the generation of
the simultaneous tree, ASAP calculates the partitioned
branch support (PBS), which identifies the relative contribution of data partitions to branch support within a
simultaneous analysis framework. Derived from branch
support (BS), in which comparisons are made between
the length of the best tree(s) and the shortest trees lacking
a given node, PBS is calculated by subtracting the length
of the partition on the best tree (LSA; based on the simultaneous analysis of the entire data matrix) from its length
on the shortest trees (LSA-N; based on simultaneous analysis) lacking a given node:
PBS = LSA-N - LSA
The difference in lengths is the contribution of a given
partition to branch support at that node on the simultaneous analysis tree. PBS can be positive (indicating character
support), negative (indicating conflict), or zero (indicating neither support nor conflict). The sum of PBS for all
partitions at a node is equal to BS at that node. Next, the
hidden support (HS) is quantified by ASAP as the difference between the BS for a given node in the simultaneous
analysis tree (BSSA) and the sum of the BS values for that
node in each of the separately analyzed partitions (BSP):
HS = ∑BSSA - ∑BSP
Similarly, partitioned hidden support (PHBS) is equal to
the PBS (PBSNP; for a given partition at a given node)
minus the BS for that node in a separate analysis of that
partition (BSN):

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/103

The sum of the PHBS values across all partitions for a
given node is equal to the HBS at that node. The calculation of HS is perhaps the most labour intensive since in
each gene region must be analyzed and BS support calculated separately and logged for comparison to the supports calculated for the simultaneous analysis. ASAP saves
the results of the calculations into a tab-delimited file,
organized by the nodes on the simultaneous analysis tree,
which can be imported into popular spreadsheet applications, like Excel. The tab-delimited file contains the support values for each partition at a given node, and can be
sorted or filtered from within a spreadsheet application
(e.g., one might identify those partitions that contribute
the highest support for a given node, versus those that
contribute the least).

Implementation
ASAP is implemented as a series of Perl scripts, and can be
installed in most OS X or UNIX environments. This implementation was used to reliably reproduce previously
reported gene/partition analyses [8]. Download and
installation instructions, along with sample data sets
based on previously published gene/partition data sets,
are available at the project Website.
ASAP can be incorporated into Websites that serve as
repositories for the growing phylogenetic hypotheses generated by the tree of life projects, where specialists can
scrutinize the phylogenetic hypotheses and where matrices can be downloaded for further detailed examination.

Results & Discussion
ASAP takes as input a series of systematically annotated
FASTA files (where each file represents a single data partition) or a list of NCBI accession numbers. As graphically
depicted in Figure 1, ASAP takes these types of input and
systematically generates a NEXUS file with the requisite
PAUP* commands to demarcate individual data partitions and accounts for disparities in the data (such as in
the cases for missing taxa or missing genes). The resulting
NEXUS file is usable by many popular phylogenetic analysis packages, and also organized in a manner to facilitate
manual inspection and further curation of the matrix.
ASAP can accommodate both aligned and unaligned
sequence data (a subroutine of ASAP will take unaligned
sequences and align them using a wide array of sequence
alignment tools, by default ASAP is designed to work with
MUSCLE [9]). For many researchers, the automation of
matrix generation of multiple data types across any
number of taxa will facilitate more complete phylogenetic
inquiries. As more data are made available from new
genome sequencing projects, automated matrix updating
can readily be generated using ASAP.

Overview of ASAP Data Flow
Overview of ASAP Data Flow. Data originate in the form of either a collection of systematically annotated FASTA files (1),
a NEXUS file with partitions delineated using the CharPars command (2), or a list of NCBI GI/Accession numbers that are
organized according to partitions (3). An alignment tool, such as MUSCLE, is applied to unaligned data (A). At this stage, ASAP
will assemble a NEXUS file that is a compilation of all the data partitions and performs a tree search to generate a simultaneous
analysis tree (4) as well as the requisite tests to determine the hidden branch supports on this tree (5). The results of the hidden branch supports are saved to a tab-delimited text file that can be imported into popular spreadsheet applications like
Microsoft Excel.

Our approach offers a solution that can be incorporated
into pipelines of computer software that automatically
scans existing databases, incorporates orthologous
sequence information into a "growing" matrix, performs
phylogenetic analysis and assesses the affect of the growth
of the matrix on the overall phylogenetic hypothesis using
a range of data types [10,11]. Importantly, ASAP is not
constrained to doing analyses exclusively with molecular
data, since a complete phylogenetic analysis may include
additional data types such as morphological, behavioral,
or ecological characters that are usually coded as discrete
character state information.
A number of character-based analyses of the concatenated
matrix can be implemented in ASAP, such as partition heterogeneity tests, partitioned Bremer support, bootstrap,
jackknife and Bayesian probabilities. These important
character-based metrics can be calculated in either a parsimony or likelihood framework. To demonstrate the flexibility of ASAP, we have also incorporated a function to
explore how data partition incongruence can be incorporated into the ASAP platform. Other methods of assessing
robustness, character support and Bayesian analyses can
also be easily interfaced with ASAP and are in preparation

as part of the ASAP pipeline. Separate analysis of individual gene regions has been used to identify those regions
that conflict with respect to phylogenetic signal (through
the calculation of incongruence length differences [3,4] –
ILDs). ILD techniques have been extended to identify congruent gene partitions [12]. In contrast to the generally
conservative methods for identifying congruent partitions
(e.g., via the mILD application [13], incongruence can
also be examined through the use of hidden support [6].
ASAP was designed to calculate hidden support through
the generation and execution of PAUP* commands.
The approach begins by first performing a heuristic tree
search for the tree best supported by the concatenated
gene/partition analysis. After a tree is generated from the
concatenated gene/partition matrix, ASAP calculates the
partitioned branch support (PBS), which identifies the
relative contribution of each of the data partitions to the
overall branch support for the concatenated tree on every
branch of that tree. PBS can be positive (indicating character support), negative (indicating conflict), or zero
(indicating neither support nor conflict). The sum of PBS
for all partitions at a node is equal to the Branch or Bremer
support (BS) at that node. The hidden branch support at

a node (HBS) and the partitioned hidden branch support
(PHBS) are also quantified by ASAP. Hidden support is
the amount of character support that a data set has that is
present because of the concatenation of gene partitions.
The PHBS values at a node are simply the amount of hidden support for a node partitioned to the various genes or
genomic regions used in the analyses. The sum of the
PHBS values across all partitions for a given node is equal
to the HBS at that node. The calculation of HBS is most
labor intensive since each gene region must be analyzed
and BS calculated separately and logged for comparison
to the supports calculated for the simultaneous analysis.
ASAP saves the results of the calculations into a tab-delimited file, organized by the nodes on the concatenated
matrix ('simultaneous') analysis tree, which can be
imported into popular spreadsheet applications, like
Microsoft Excel. These data can then be used to characterize individual genes and genomic regions for their congruence with the overall evolutionary history of the
organisms in the analysis.

sive task of generating matrices and performing the requisite steps to perform a simultaneous analysis for multipartition data sets. The current implementation of ASAP
(written in Perl) interacts with recent versions of PAUP*,
and produces results in a format that can be imported into
popular spreadsheet applications like Microsoft Excel for
subsequent examination.

As ASAP is character based, the phylogenomic trees constructed using ASAP can be used not only to resolve phylogenetic relationships based on genome scale data, but
can also be used to identify the genes and characters associated with the evolution of species and traits. A distancebased approach (e.g. Neighbor Joining or UPGMA) may
not allow one to readily use such phylogenomic
approaches for gene discovery in the way that can be
accomplished with ASAP. These character-based methods
allow the researcher to examine the specific gene regions
and which individual characters that provide support or
conflict with the overall topology of a tree generated from
a concatenated matrix. While ASAP is able to assemble
large multi-gene matrices for genomic analyses for us in
PAUP*, for example, there remain challenges to the analyses of large data sets which would require heuristic rather
than exhaustive searches. For this reason, by default, ASAP
analysis command files implement rigorous heuristic
searches and can accommodate methods such that the
parsimony ratchet [8].

At face value, in the case of conflict, this information can
be used to identify regions of interest for additional data
gathering. The use of these metrics may not be confined to
the examination of evolutionary biology hypotheses – an
examination of conflict on a simultaneous analysis tree
could, for example, identify gene regions whose history is
in conflict with phylogenetic history for possibly inferring
lateral gene transfer events, or specific characters that
could be targeted for loss of function studies.

The automated simultaneous analysis phylogenetics
