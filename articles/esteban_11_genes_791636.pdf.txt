Genes in the terminal regions of orthopoxvirus
genomes experience adaptive molecular
evolution
David J Esteban* and Anne P Hutchinson

Abstract
Background: Orthopoxviruses are dsDNA viruses with large genomes, some encoding over 200 genes. Genes
essential for viral replication are located in the center of the linear genome and genes encoding host response
modifiers and other host interacting proteins are located in the terminal regions. The central portion of the
genome is highly conserved, both in gene content and sequence, while the terminal regions are more diverse. In
this study, we investigated the role of adaptive molecular evolution in poxvirus genes and the selective pressures
that act on the different regions of the genome. The relative fixation rates of synonymous and non-synonymous
mutations (the dN/dS ratio) are an indicator of the mechanism of evolution of sequences, and can be used to
identify purifying, neutral, or diversifying selection acting on a gene. Like highly conserved residues, amino acids
under diversifying selection may be functionally important. Many genes experiencing diversifying selection are
involved in host-pathogen interactions, such as antigen-antibody interactions, or the “host-pathogen arms race.”
Results: We analyzed 175 gene families from orthopoxviruses for evidence of diversifying selection. 79 genes were
identified as experiencing diversifying selection, 25 with high confidence. Many of these genes are located in the
terminal regions of the genome and function to modify the host response to infection or are virion-associated,
indicating a greater role for diversifying selection in host-interacting genes. Of the 79 genes, 20 are of unknown
function, and implicating diversifying selection as an important mechanism in their evolution may help characterize
their function or identify important functional residues.
Conclusions: We conclude that diversifying selection is an important mechanism of orthopoxvirus evolution.
Diversifying selection in poxviruses may be the result of interaction with host defense mechanisms.

Background
Poxviruses are a family of double stranded DNA viruses
that infect diverse host species. The genus Orthopoxvirus includes Variola (the causative agent of smallpox),
Vaccinia (the smallpox vaccine), Monkeypox, an emerging human pathogen, and Cowpox.
Poxviruses are among the largest and most complex of
all animal viruses, some expressing over 200 genes [1].
A large fraction of the coding capacity of the genome is
for processes essential for viral replication, such as virion assembly, transcription and replication. Unlike other
DNA viruses, poxviruses replicate in the cytoplasm and
therefore encode all genes necessary for DNA

replication and transcription. These essential genes are
highly conserved throughout the poxvirus family and in
orthopoxviruses these core genes form a continuous
block in the center of the linear genome [2,3].
Flanking the central region, the terminal regions of
orthopoxvirus genomes show divergence among different genera, among species within a genus, and even
among strains of the same species [4]. Many of these
genes are non-essential for virus replication in cell culture but are virulence factors that mediate interactions
with the host cell or immune system in their natural
host. These include immune evasion genes that inhibit
cytokines [5], inhibit the interferon response [6], or
block apoptosis [7]. Many of these are host species specific, indicating adaptation to the specific host response
to infection.

Analysis of the content and organization of the orthopoxvirus genome implicates gene gain and loss as major
mechanisms in their evolution [8]. Cowpox virus strain
Brighton Red (CPXV-BR) has a “master set” of genes; all
other orthopoxviruses have a smaller subset of those
genes. Thus it is likely that as the orthopoxviruses
evolved and diversified into different hosts, some genes
were lost while those that were retained adapted to the
specific host. The sequence conservation of the core
genes may be the result of stringent structural or functional constraints on these core proteins. Host-response
modifier genes in the terminal regions, however, may be
more able to change and thus show greater sequence
divergence. As such, we were interested in understanding the role of adaptive molecular evolution in poxvirus
genes and the selective pressures that act on genes in
different regions of the genome. Adaptive molecular
evolution, or diversifying selection, is a key mechanism
for species divergence and identifying proteins or specific residues experiencing diversifying selection may be
important in understanding gene function.
Diversifying selection can be detected by measuring
the ratio of non-synonymous/synonymous mutation
fixation rates (ω = d N /d S ) [9-11]. Codons experience
continual nucleotide substitutions as a result of errors in
replication. Substitutions that result in synonymous
mutations are selectively neutral. However, non-synonymous mutations can occur and become fixed as a
result of selection. In purifying selection (ω < 1), a
higher rate of synonymous than non-synonymous mutations occurs, suggesting stringent structural or functional constraints on the amino acid. In neutral
selection (ω = 1) a change to a different amino acid has
neither a positive nor negative effect on the protein. In
diversifying selection (ω > 1) the rate of fixation of nonsynonymous mutations is greater than the rate of fixation of synonymous mutations, indicating adaptive
molecular evolution.
In this study we analyzed a set of 175 orthopoxvirus gene
families using CPXV-BR as a reference genome to determine the selective pressures acting upon them. We show
that diversifying selection occurs most strongly in the
terminal regions of the genome. The results of this study
may help identify important functional regions in genes of
known or unknown function, and may help categorize
genes of unknown function as host-interacting genes.

Results
Gene families

The data set collected from the Viral Bioinformatics
Resource Centre database contained 19,874 chordopoxvirus gene sequences. After the removal of identical
sequences, 7758 unique sequences from 103 viruses
remained (Additional file 1). Sequences were parsed into

Page 2 of 12

380 gene families of which 214 were present in the
CPXV-BR genome.
The CPXV-BR genome encodes 235 genes belonging to
214 gene families. Of the 214 gene families, 38 were
excluded from the analysis (Additional file 2). 16 gene
families (containing a total of 37 genes) were excluded
because they were duplicated in the genome and therefore have the potential for differential evolutionary pressures on each paralog. 17 families with fewer than 6
sequences were excluded, since too few taxa in the dataset results in poor power to identify amino acid sites
under diversifying selection [12]. Gene family size in the
final dataset ranged from 6-69 sequences. 6 gene families
were removed because of difficulty in generating a reliable alignment, fragmentation of the gene in CPXV, or
excessive computational time required for analysis due to
large family size and length of genes. The final dataset
had a total of 175 gene families, comprising a total of
6058 sequences analyzed (Additional file 3). CPXV-BR is
used as the reference strain for the purposes of referring
to gene names, codon positions and genome organization, however, because the analysis is performed on gene
families, not single gene sequences, the results apply to
homologous genes of all poxviruses used in this study.
Treelength (S), measured as the number of substitutions per codon in the tree, can be used as a measure of
sequence divergence in the gene family. Genes with treelengths that are too short (S < 0.11) are insufficiently
divergent for this analysis [12]. All genes included in this
analysis had S > 0.11. S values ranged from 0.225 to
43.02, with only three above 30 (Additional file 3). Genes
found to be under diversifying selection (see below) were
distributed throughout the range of treelengths.
The length of CPXV genes ranged from 42 to 1286
codons, with the majority having a length of less than
400 codons, and only 5 greater than 800 codons. Genes
found to be under diversifying selection were distributed
throughout the range (data not shown).
Diversifying selection

We wanted to determine which genes in poxvirus genomes showed adaptive molecular evolution (diversifying
selection). To do this, we used site models of codon evolution to determine the rate of fixation of synonymous and
non-synonymous mutations that can identify the presence
of an amino acid site (codon) class under diversifying
selection. Codon models use a statistical distribution to
describe the variation in ω among sites, and make no
assumptions about which sites are under diversifying
selection. Site models permit differing dN/dS ratios at each
codon, and because selective pressures are expected to
vary across amino acids, this approach has high power to
detect diversifying selection in genes [11]. Each gene
family was analyzed for evidence of diversifying selection

Esteban and Hutchinson BMC Genomics 2011, 12:261

by testing if the data fits a null model (which does not
allow for sites under diversifying selection) better than an
alternative model, which does allow for sites under diversifying selection. Two model comparisons were applied:
M1a vs. M2a, M7 vs. M8, where M1a and M7 are null
models and M2a and M8 are alternate models. A log likelihood ratio test was then applied to determine whether
allowing for a site class with ω>1 results in a significantly
better fit of the model to the data.
Evidence for diversifying selection was considered to
be strong where both comparisons were found to be significant at p < 0.05. 25 genes were identified by both
models as having an amino acid site class experiencing
diversifying selection (null models rejected, p < 0.05)
(Table 1). With model M8 (a less conservative model)
an additional 54 genes were identified as having sites
experiencing diversifying selection (null model rejected,
p < 0.05), for a total of 79 genes under diversifying
selection (Additional file 4). All significant genes under
model M2a were also significant under model M8,
except one (Unknown YMTV120.5L).
Alternative models M2a and M8 allow for the existence of a codon site class under diversifying selection.
The proportion of sites that fall into this site class provides insight into the selective pressure experienced by
the gene. For each gene, the proportion of sites that are
under diversifying selection was determined (Additional
file 5). Among the genes for which the diversifying
selection models showed a significantly better fit of the
data, the proportion of sites under diversifying selection
ranged from 0.1% to 14.6% (model M2a) and 0.1% to
29.5% (model M8). A gene does not necessarily need a
large proportion of sites under diversifying selection to
fit the alternative model better. In many genes, a large
proportion of amino acids may be virtually invariable
due to structural or functional constraints, while diversifying selection occurs at only a few key sites. For example, the F6L homolog (unknown function) has a small
proportion of sites under diversifying selection (2.9%),
while the mitochondrial associated apoptosis inhibitor
has a large proportion of sites under diversifying selection (14.0%) and for both the null model was rejected.
Using the CPXV-BR genome as a reference for gene
positions within the genome, we noted a distinct pattern
of genes with a high proportion of sites under diversifying selection being located closer to the termini of the
genome, as well as a tendency for significant genes
(model M2a) to be located in the terminal regions (Figure 1). A centrally located core set of 90 genes is present in all chordopoxvirues [2]. A chi square test
revealed that genes experiencing diversifying selection
identified by model M2a were significantly more likely
to be found among the 85 terminally located less conserved genes (c 2 = 12.56, df = 1, p < 0.05). The 79

Page 3 of 12

genes identified by model M8 however were proportionately distributed between the core and less conserved
genes (c2 = 0.05, df = 1, p > 0.05).
The non-synonymous/synonymous rate ratio (ω = dN/
dS ) is an important indicator of selective pressure at the
protein level. The dN/dS ratio of a gene is calculated as
the average of the ω of each codon in the gene. A higher
dN/dS ratio suggests a greater role for diversifying selection in the molecular evolution of the gene. Again we
note that genes with high dN/dS ratios are located in the
termini of the genome (Figure 2). Some significant genes
have an average dN/dS ratio less than 1, indicating that
diversifying selection has occurred in these genes, but
not sufficiently to cause the average to be greater than 1.
These genes may have only a small proportion of amino
acids under diversifying selection or a larger proportion
that experiences weaker diversifying selection.
The d N /d S ratio of the site class under diversifying
selection (ω2) was also determined (Additional file 5).
This value is a measurement of the intensity of diversifying selection within that site class. For example, Semaphorin (CPXV-BR-182) experiences very strong
diversifying selection (ω2 = 10.417) in only a small proportion of total sites (2.7%). The F7L homolog (CPXVBR-055, unknown function) also has a site class experiencing diversifying selection (ω2 = 8.343), however this
slightly weaker selection is spread over a greater proportion of sites (12.9%). For this reason, diversifying selection cannot be identified solely on the basis of quantity of
sites experiencing diversifying pressure along the gene,
but also the strength of the pressure acting on these
genes. A few genes have ω2 > 1 but the data do not fit
the diversifying selection model significantly better than
the null model, indicating that a site class under diversifying selection likely does not exist for these genes.
Function and localization of genes under diversifying
selection

The 79 genes identified were broadly categorized by
function and localization (Table 1, Additional file 4 and
Figure 3) based on annotation in the Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center curated genes database [13] and
several reports on poxvirus genomes [1,14,15]. The largest category is that of genes of unknown function (20
genes), but many host response modifiers or host-range
genes (16 genes) were also found. Enzymes and structural components were also identified. Classified by
localization, 36 of the proteins under diversifying selection have been found to be virion associated (Figure 3B
and 3C). Localization in the virion was determined from
two proteomics studies [16,17] and previous literature
[1]. All of the proteins of unknown function, and most
(81%) of the host response modifiers are not found in
the virion. 18 out of 25 (72%) of the enzymes involved

in DNA or RNA metabolism, as well as the majority of
proteins used to assemble or form the structure of the
virion (87%) are found in the virion. Focusing on the 25
genes identified by both models, host-response modifiers
and genes of unknown function make up the largest
proportions, 36% and 40%, respectively (Figure 3A). Of
the 6 remaining genes, 5 are found in the virion (Thymidine kinase is not found in the virion).
Identification of specific residues under diversifying
selection

For each gene identified as experiencing diversifying
selection, the posterior probabilities of each site falling

into the three categories were calculated using a Bayes
empirical Bayes (BEB) analysis [18]. For each gene, every
codon was assigned to either the purifying, neutral or
diversifying site classes. Two examples are shown: the
Interleukin-18 binding protein (IL-18BP) (Figure 4A)
and the mitochondrial associated apoptosis inhibitor
(Figure 4B). As with most genes, most codons of the IL18BP gene are under purifying selection, with a small
proportion under neutral or diversifying selection. For
example, the posterior probabilities for site W124 are
0.000, 0.057, and 0.942 for purifying, neutral and diversifying selection, thus the site is highly likely to be under
diversifying selection. A total of 8 specific sites are

conserved C-terminal domain of the mitochondrial associated apoptosis inhibitor, and an additional 2 are in the

file 6 and Additional file 7.

Discussion
In this study we analyzed a large set of poxvirus genes
with the purpose of identifying genes experiencing adaptive molecular evolution. Of 235 genes in the Cowpox
virus genome, 175 were analyzed using phylogenetic
analysis of maximum likelihood (PAML) and subsequently analyzed by Bayes empirical Bayes to determine
the probability of each codon falling into the three

possible site classes of purifying, neutral or diversifying
selection. We identified 79 genes under diversifying
selection, representing 45% of the analyzed genes in the
genome. Of those, 25 (14% of genes analyzed) were
identified with both models, indicating high confidence.
Thus we identify diversifying selection as an important
mechanism of evolution in poxviruses.

Analysis of genes spanning the CPXV genome
revealed that diversifying selection is a more important
mechanism of molecular evolution in the genome’s
terminal regions than in the central genes. This may be
due to diversifying pressures applied by host interactions. Among different orthopoxvirus species and even
strains, terminal regions are more diverse both in gene

content and gene sequences [2]. Many terminally
located genes are host response modifiers that directly
interact with components of the host immune response
or cellular response to infection. Grouping the genes
identified in this study into broad functional categories
(Figure 3), we identified several host response modifiers
and host range genes that have sites under diversifying
selection. These may be sites that are involved in hostspecific interactions, demonstrating adaptation to the

Page 7 of 12

virus’s particular host. Previous studies have also
demonstrated diversifying selection in poxvirus host
response modifying genes [19-21]. The current study
uses the largest dataset providing the most comprehensive analysis of diversifying selection in poxvirus genomes. Among the host response modifiers identified
were several secreted immunomodulators (IL-18 binding
protein, IL-1 beta receptor and IFN gamma receptor)
that are known to contribute to virulence [22-24].
Genes that modulate the cellular response to infection
were also identified, including the mitochondrial associated apoptosis inhibitor, an inhibitor of the protein
kinase R (PKR) response to double stranded RNA, a ubiquitin ligase, and an inhibitor of Toll-like receptor signaling [25-28].
In addition to host response modifying genes, we
also showed, using model M8, that genes involved in
viral replication and virion structure experience diversifying selection, possibly due to their protein products
being packaged in the virion. A proteomics study [17]
identified 75 viral proteins in the VACV virion, 18 of
which are present at abundances greater than 1% of
the weight of the virion. Of those, 6 were identified in
the current study, including the major core protein
(A4), the most abundant protein in the virion by
weight. Further, the immune response to poxvirus
infection induces the formation of neutralizing antibodies to several virion membrane proteins [29,30]. We
identified 3 known major targets of neutralizing antibodies: an immature virion membrane protein (A7,
CPXV-BR-154), carbonic anhydrase (D8, CPXV-BR129) and an enveloped virion protein (B5, CPXV-BR205). Thus detection of diversifying selection is not
limited to host response modifying genes but more
broadly to genes whose products interact with the
host, such as major antigens.
Designation of families in the VOCs database was
based on a BLAST expect value of 10-17, thus families
are likely to be composed of orthologs [2]. Horizontal
gene transfer (HGT) is recognized as a factor in evolution of poxvirus genomes. It is possible that some of the
genes within a gene family may not be orthologs if they
arose through multiple independent horizontal gene
transfer events. Several lines of evidence are needed to
demonstrate HGT, including phylogenetic clustering of
the gene in taxa unrelated to the genome under study.
The origins of most poxvirus genes are unknown,
although most chordopoxvirus genes show greater similarity to eukaryotic genes than to other viral genes [31].
Full phylogenies of each poxvirus gene family are
needed to determine if multiple horizontal gene transfer
events have occurred within the family. Such research is
underway and will be valuable in further interpretation
of the current data.

indicated below the axis.

Like highly conserved amino acids, variable positions
under diversifying selection may indicate functionally or
structurally important positions. Computational identification of amino acids under diversifying selection has
revealed important functional or antigenic sites in several studies [32,33]. One of the genes identified in this
study was the Interleukin-18 binding protein (IL-18BP),
which was previously shown to attenuate the immune
response in mice [22]. The crystal structure of the
Ectromelia virus (ECTV) IL-18 binding protein was
recently determined [34]. Bayes empirical Bayes analysis
demonstrated that most residues are under purifying
selection, while some are neutral and a few are under
diversifying selection (Figure 4). The crystal structure
and previous mutagenesis studies [35] identified contact
residues important in binding the ligand, IL-18. Most of
these residues were found to be under purifying selection, supporting a requirement for conservation of these
residues to maintain function. Interestingly, 2 residues

shown through crystallography to be contacts in the
binding interface were also identified as being under
diversifying selection (D48 and I115 in CPXV-BR, E48
and L115 in ECTV). Both of these residues interact with
binding site C on human IL-18 [34]. Evidence of diversifying selection in these positions may suggest a role for
these residues in adaptation to IL-18 of the specific host
species of the virus.
Another important host response modifying gene that
we identified is the mitochondrial associated apoptosis
inhibitor (F1L in VACV-Cop). Apoptosis is an important cellular response to infection that serves to limit
viral replication through removal of infected cells. F1L
inhibits apoptosis through binding to the pro-apoptotic
protein Bak [36,37] thereby inhibiting the permeabilization of the mitochondrial membrane, a critical step in
apoptosis. Interaction with Bak is via Bcl2-like homology
(BH) domains that are highly divergent but nonetheless
form characteristic BH domain folds [37]. Among the

Esteban and Hutchinson BMC Genomics 2011, 12:261
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/261

poxviruses, the C-terminus (containing the BH domains)
of the F1L family is highly conserved. There are 7 residues under diversifying selection located in this domain
(Figure 4B). Of those, 2 residues identified in this study
are located in the BH domains. BH3 and BH1, primarily
located on alpha helices a2 and a5, make up the BH3
binding pocket responsible for binding Bak [37]. One
residue (A173 CPXV) identified in this study, corresponding to A144 in the F1L homolog of Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA), is located in the binding pocket
and was shown by mutagenesis to increase binding affinity if mutated to phenylalanine. M124 in CPXV (I95 in
MVA) is located in a2 and therefore could be involved
in ligand binding or in determining the shape of the
pocket. Another 3 sites under diversifying selection are
located immediately C-terminal to BH2. Overall, the
capacity of the Bayes empirical Bayes analysis to identify
residues known to be important in protein function,
such as in the IL-18BP and mitochondrial associated
apoptosis inhibitor, suggests that it may be valuable to
test other predicted sites across the genome for their
role in protein function.
The identification of host-interacting genes in poxviruses as ones experiencing adaptive molecular evolution is consistent with the findings of several other
studies identifying genes involved in the “host-pathogen
arms race” or other co-evolutionary processes and is
seen throughout nature. Chitinase and other plant
defense proteins show evidence of diversifying selection,
and mutagenesis studies have confirmed the functional
importance of the identified sites [32,38]. The wsp gene
of the bacterium Wolbachia, which encodes an outer
membrane protein, shows evidence of diversifying selection when in a parasitic relationship with arthropods,
but not in a mutualistic relationship with nematodes
[39]. In other viruses, all the major genes of HIV
[40,41], and the capsid protein of Foot-and-Mouth Disease virus (FMDV) [33] experience diversifying selection.
Importantly, the amino acids identified computationally
in the FMDV capsid are known to be antigenic sites
identified by monoclonal antibody escape mutants [33].
In host species, diversifying selection has been shown in
the antigen recognition sites of the major histocompatibility (MHC) gene [42,43].
As has been demonstrated with the FMDV capsid protein [33], interaction between an antigen and the
immune response can drive diversifying selection. Several studies have found evidence of diversifying selection
in surface proteins on viruses, including HIV env, influenza hemagglutinin, and others [44-46]. Recent proteomics studies have identified the major and minor virionassociated proteins [16,17]. In this study, 39% of the
genes identified are associated with the virion (Figure 3).
Virion structural components and virion-associated

enzymes may have greater exposure to antibody
responses, leading to diversifying selection.
A few small whole genomes have been analyzed for
diversifying selection, showing that diversifying selection
can play strikingly different roles in the molecular evolution of organisms. A study of Picornaviridae shows evidence of diversifying selection in structural proteins but
not in non-structural proteins [47]. Only a few codons
in the astrovirus genome are under diversifying selection
[48], while 9-38% of sites in human rhinoviruses experience diversifying selection [49]. The poxvirus genome is
significantly larger than any other viral genome analyzed
by this method, and the results indicate a more important role for diversifying selection in poxvirus genome
evolution than in other viruses. This may be related to
the large size of the poxvirus genome and the large
number of accessory “non-essential” genes such as the
host-response modifiers or the large number of encapsidated proteins. Over 1700 genes of the Streptococcus
genome were analyzed and approximately 8% of the
genes were found to be under diversifying selection [50].
Of those, 29% are related to virulence, and many others
show tissue specific expression during invasive disease.
A large fraction of poxvirus genes under diversifying
selection are also known to be virulence factors, echoing
the findings in Streptococcus.
In Streptococcus, several essential core function genes
were identified, indicating that virulence is more complex than simply the presence of pathogen associated
genes [50]. Similarly, analysis of E. coli genomes found
29 genes common to pathogenic and non-pathogenic
strains which showed evidence of diversifying selection,
and many of which are involved in functions like DNA
metabolism and nutrient acquisition [51]. Several core
poxvirus genes, not typically thought of as virulence factors, were also found to be under diversifying selection
in the poxvirus genome. Some (but not all) of these are
packaged in the virion and may be exposed to the host
antibody response. However, this suggests that other
poxvirus systems, in addition to manipulation of the
host response, may be important in virulence. In
attempting to explain virulence differences between
strains of poxviruses, it may therefore be important to
consider not only major genomic differences such as
gene complement, but also diversifying selection in well
conserved genes.

Conclusions
The identification of 79 genes in the orthopoxviruses
that experience diversifying selection implicates this as a
major mechanism of poxvirus evolution. Because many
of these genes either interact with host defense mechanisms or may be targets of the immune response, interaction with the host may be the basis for adaptive

molecular evolution. Understanding the mechanisms of
poxvirus evolution may shed light on important aspects
of poxvirus biology such as adaptation of monkeypox
virus to become more sustainable in human populations.
Combined with experimental data, identification of sites
under diversifying selection may be important in guiding
future mutagenesis studies, as these residues may be
important in host specific interactions such as proteinprotein contacts or immune epitopes. Further, many
genes with unknown or poorly defined functions were
shown to have sites under diversifying selection. These
data may provide a basis for investigating the function
of these as host-interacting proteins or virulence factors,
and may identify highly conserved functional residues or
diverse host-specific residues that are of particular
interest.

Methods
Sequence selection and alignment

A subset of viruses of the Chordopoxvirus subfamily was
selected based on close phylogenetic relationships [4].
Fully sequenced genomes of the Orthopoxvirus, Leporipoxvirus, Yatapoxvirus, Capripoxvirus, Suipoxvirus and
Mule Deer pox genera were used (Additional file 1,
Table S1). Other Chordopoxvirus genera were excluded
because their sequences were typically too divergent to
generate reliable alignments and have very different %
GC content compared to other poxviruses. Gene
families were defined by the Viral Orthologous Clusters
(VOCs) database [2]. CPXV-BR virus was used as a
reference genome; all gene positions used are those in
CPXV-BR, and only gene families with a member in
CPXV-BR were used in the analysis. Gene families with
duplicated genes (paralogs) and gene families that contained less than 6 genes were excluded.
All protein and nucleotide sequences were acquired
from the VOCs database. Using perl scripts, identical
nucleotide sequences and their corresponding amino
acid sequences were removed and then parsed into their
respective gene families. Codon based alignments of
nucleic acid sequences of gene families were generated
using PRANK [52]. PRANK has been shown to generate
more reliable alignments resulting in fewer false positives than other alignment programs [53].
Tree construction

Maximum likelihood trees were constructed from the
nucleotide alignments using the DNAml executable
within the PHYLIP program. The trees were used as
starting points for subsequent analysis using PAML4.
Detection of evolutionary pressures with PAML4

Each gene family was analyzed using the codeml program within the PAML4 package [54] to assess the

Page 10 of 12

selective forces acting on the genes. Codon based
models were used since they have the greatest power
to detect differing selective pressures acting on a protein [10,11]. To identify the presence of a codon site
class under diversifying selection, two separate site
model comparisons were used. In the first, the null
model M1a, which allows for two site categories, ω =
0 and ω = 1, was compared to the alternative model
M2a, that has an additional site class in which ω is
allowed to exceed 1. In the second comparison, the
null model (M7) that allows for sites with 0 < ω < 1,
was compared to the alternative model (M8) that
allows for an additional site class in which ω may
exceed 1. Each gene family was analyzed on a 156
core cluster composed of 2.2GHz AMD Opteron
cores. The computational time taken for each gene
family varied by the number of sequences per gene
family and the length of the sequences and ranged
from several minutes to 31 days. Perl scripts were
then used to compile results.
Differences in log likelihood values between null and
alternative hypotheses were analyzed using the Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) and the resulting values compared to appropriate chi squared values to determine
significance, using a confidence threshold of p < 0.05
and df = 1.
Bayes empirical Bayes

For genes in which the alternative model showed a significantly better fit of the data, Bayes theorem [18] was applied
to calculate the posterior probability that each site belongs
to a particular ω class. This was performed through the
codeml executable of the PAML4 package [54].
