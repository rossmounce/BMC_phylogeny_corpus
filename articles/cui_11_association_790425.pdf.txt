and ofloxacin resistance levels in Mycobacterium
tuberculosis isolates from East China in 2009

Abstract
Background: This study aimed to analyze the association of mutation patterns in gyrA and gyrB genes and the
ofloxacin resistance levels in clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates sampled in 2009 from East China.
Methods: The quinolone resistance-determining region of gyrA/B were sequenced in 192 M. tuberculosis clinical
isolates and the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 95 ofloxacin-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates were
determined by using microplate nitrate reductase assays.
Results: Mutations in gyrA (codons 90, 91 and 94) and in gyrB (G551R, D500N, T539N, R485C/L) were observed in
89.5% (85/95) and 11.6% (11/95) of ofloxacin-resistant strains, respectively. The gyrB mutations G551R and G549D
were observed in 4.1% (4/97) of ofloxacin-susceptible strains and no mutation was found in gyrA in ofloxacinsusceptible strains. The MICs of all ofloxacin-resistant strains showed no significant difference among strains with
mutations at codons 90, 91 or 94 in gyrA (F = 1.268, p = 0.287). No differences were detected among strains with
different amino acid mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining region of gyrA (F = 1.877, p = 0.123). The
difference in MICs between ofloxacin-resistant strains with mutations in gyrA only and ofloxacin-resistant strains
with mutations in both gyrA and gyrB genes was not statistically significant (F = 0.549, p = 0.461).
Conclusions: Although gyrA/B mutations can lead to ofloxacin resistance in M. tuberculosis, there were no
associations of different mutation patterns in gyrA/B and the level of ofloxacin resistance in M. tuberculosis isolates
from East China in 2009.

Background
Fluoroquinolones (FQs), such as ofloxacin (OFX), levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, are widely used anti-tubercular therapeutic agents for the treatment of multidrugresistant tuberculosis (MTB) [1]. In mycobacteria, FQs
bind to DNA gyrase and inhibit DNA replication [2].
This mechanism has been verified by the structural analysis and functional analysis of enzymes of M. tuberculosis (MTB), including DNA gyrase [3,4]. These studies
showed that the MTB strains with wild-type gyrA/B
genes were highly susceptible to FQs. Moreover, a murine model study showed that low-level FQ resistance
could be overcome with the use of high dose moxifloxacin [5].

Since FQs are often prescribed as broad-spectrum
antibiotics for the treatment of undiagnosed respiratory
infections, and because TB patients are not treated normatively, FQ-resistant TB has become more prevalent
[6]. With the occurrence of extensively drug-resistant
TB in recent years, concerns about FQ-resistant TB
have been raised [7-9]. Reports show that the majority
(approximately 50%~90%) of FQ-resistant MTB isolates
carry mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining
region (QRDR) of the gyrA gene [2,10-15], and that a
small number have mutations in the gyrB gene [16,17].
Much research has focused on the mutations in gyrA/
gyrB of MTB to determine the drug susceptibility to
FQs [15,18]. A correlation between quinolone susceptibility patterns and nucleotide sequences in the A and B
subunits of DNA gyrase in 14 mycobacterial species has
been described [19]. There are, however, no data on the
correlation between quinolone susceptibility patterns

and gyrA/gyrB mutations in MTB clinical isolates. This
study aimed to investigate whether different mutations
in gyrA/gyrB could lead to different levels of FQ-resistance in MTB strains. We analyzed the association of
OFX resistance levels and the characterization of different mutations in gyrA/gyrB related to this resistance in
clinical MTB isolates from East China.

Methods
Strain selection

A total of 192 MTB clinical isolates were collected from
epidemiologically unlinked pulmonary TB patients in
East China in 2009. The epidemiological selection was
analyzed by IS6110 restriction fragment length polymorphisms [20]. All MTB strains were identified by biochemical methods and by PCR detection based on
primers derived from IS6110 [21]. All samples were
tested for OFX-resistance by the MGIT 960 method
(Becton & Dickinson) and a total of 95 OFX-resistant
MTB strains were selected at random. Ninety-seven
OFX-susceptible MTB strains were also selected at random from all of the OFX-susceptible strains. The MTB
H37Rv strain (ATCC 27294) was used as the reference
control. The study was approved by the ethics committee of Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital. Written informed
consent was obtained from all the participants.
Drug susceptibility analysis

The drug susceptibility test (DST) of selected strains
was carried out by the MGIT 960 method [22,23].
OFX (Sigma Aldrich Co., St Louis, USA) was dissolved
in 0.1 M NaOH and diluted in purified water. The
stock solutions were made at a concentration of 10 g/L
and sterilized using a 0.22 μm polycarbonate membrane filter (Camghwohill, Co. Cork, Ireland). The
stock solutions were stored at -70°C in small aliquots
for up to 6 months. Frozen drug solutions were
thawed once and then discarded. The OFX test concentration was 2 mg/L.
MIC determination

The MIC determination of selected strains was carried
out by using a microplate nitrate reductase assay (NRA),
as described by Kumar et al [24]. The final concentrations of OFX ranged from 0.125 mg/L to 64 mg/L.
DNA extraction

One ml of MTB suspension collected from a MGIT
960 control tube was transferred to a 1.5 ml tube and
centrifuged at 10,000 g for 5 min. The supernatant was
discarded and the sediment was re-suspended in 50 μl
DNA extraction solution (0.04% NaOH, 0.1% SDS and
15% Chelex-100 chelating resin) and mixed by vortexing. Subsequently, the tube was incubated at 100°C for

Page 2 of 5

15 min and centrifuged at 13,000 g for 10 min after it
had cooled. Finally, the supernatant was transferred to
another 1.5 ml tube and preserved at -20°C until
further use.
PCR

GyrA was amplified with the use of the gyrAF (5’- AGACACGACGTTGCCGC- CTG-3’) and gyrAR (5’- CTGAC
CCGTTGGCCAGCAGG-3’) primers. GyrB was amplified
with the use of the gyrBF (5’- GCGCTGACGTC
GGTGGTGAA-3’) and gyrBR (5’- ATTCCGGGTCACTGCGCTGC-3’) primers. These primers were
designed by Primer-BLAST software with reference to the
gyrA (GenBank accession no.: NC_000962.2) and gyrB
(GenBank accession no.: NC_000962.2) gene sequences of
MTB. The sizes of the amplified fragments were 530 bp
for gyrA and 772 bp for gyrB.
Sequencing

PCR products were purified and sequenced by Sangon
Biotech (Shanghai, China). DNA sequences were analyzed with MegAlign 5.01 software (Demonstration System DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, USA).
Statistical analysis

SPSS software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used
for the statistical analysis. The MICs of OFX-resistant
MTB strains with different mutations in gyrA or gyrB
were compared by the analysis of variance (ANOVA)
test.

Results
Mutations were observed in the QRDRs of gyrA/gyrB in
87 out of 95 (91.6%) OFX-resistant MTB strains, apart
from a S95T mutation in gyrA, which was a natural
polymorphism [25] that occurred in both OFX-resistant
and OFX susceptible strains in this study. No mutations
were observed in the QRDRs of gyrA/gyrB in 8 out of
95 OFX-resistant MTB strains (8.4%) except for the
S95T mutation in gyrA. The MICs of 97 OFX-susceptible strains were less than 2 mg/L while the MICs of 95
OFX-resistant strains were ≥2 mg/L.
Mutations were observed in the QRDR of gyrA in 85
of the 95 (89.5%) OFX-resistant strains, while none of
the OFX-susceptible strains displayed any mutations.
The most common single nucleotide mutation sites
were codons 94, 91, and 90 and, in total, the relative frequencies of these codons were 56.8% (54/95), 6.3% (6/
95) and 25.3% (24/95), respectively. There was one
OFX-resistant strain with two mutations (codons 90 and
94) in gyrA.
GyrA mutations and MICs of the 85 OFX-resistant
MTB mutants are shown in Table 1. The OFX MICs of
strains with mutations at codon 94 ranged from 2 mg/L

to 32 mg/L, with a median of 4 mg/L. The OFX MICs
of resistant strains with mutations at either codon 90 or
91 ranged from 2 mg/L to 16 mg/L (median, 4 mg/L).
The OFX MICs of three OFX-resistant groups with different single codon mutations in gyrA were analyzed by
ANOVA, which showed no statistically significant difference among the three groups (F = 1.268, p = 0.287). The
difference of OFX MICs of seven OFX-resistant groups
with different amino acid mutations (A90V, S91P,
D94A, D94G, D94N, D94Y, D94F) in gyrA were also
analyzed by ANOVA, which also showed no significant
differences (F = 0.829, p = 0.551). The difference of
OFX MICs of five OFX-resistant groups with different
amino acid mutations at codon 94 (D94A, D94G, D94N,
D94Y, D94F) in gyrA showed no statistical significance
(F = 0.455, p = 0.768).
Mutations were observed in the QRDRs of gyrB in 11
of the 95 (11.6%) OFX-resistant strains. The single
nucleotide mutation sites were in codons 551, 500, 539
and 485, according to the GenBank CAB02426.1 numbering system. In total, the relative frequencies of these
codons were 3.2% (3/95), 4.2% (4/95), 2.1% (2/95) and
2.1% (2/95), respectively. The MICs and the mutations
of gyrA of OFX-resistant strains with mutations in gyrB
are shown in Table 2. There were two OFX-resistant
strains with only mutations in gyrB, one at codon 485
and one at codon 500. Amino acid mutations were
observed in QRDRs of gyrB in 4 of the 97 (4.1%) OFXsusceptible strains. These mutations were from Gly
(GGG) to Arg (AGG) at codon 551 in three samples
and from Gly (GGC) to Asp (GAC) at codon 549 in one
strain. There was also a single silent mutation from Ile
(ATC) to Ile (ATT) at codon 457 in one OFX-susceptible strain.
The MICs of OFX-resistant strains with mutations in
gyrA only and without mutations in gyrB were compared
with the MICs of OFX-resistant strains that had mutations in both gyrA and gyrB. The difference in MICs of
the two groups were analyzed by ANOVA, which

showed no statistical significance between the two
groups (F = 0.549, p = 0.461).

Discussion
Previous studies have shown that the level of drug resistance of MTB is linked to gene mutations. Huitric et al.
described that most rpoB mutations are correlated with
high-level resistance against rifampicin and that a lower
level of resistance was associated with mutations in
codon 522 of rpoB [26]. Kim et al. showed that mutations in codon 315 of katG were associated with high
levels of isoniazid resistance, whereas a mutation in the
inhA promoter region was associated with low-level
resistance to isoniazid [27].
Mutations in short regions of gyrA, known as QRDR,
have been associated with FQ resistance in MTB [28].
Several studies [10,11,13] have analyzed the mutations
in the gyrA gene in clinical isolates of MTB. Most of
these studies focused on the frequency of the mutations
in gyrA/gyrB genes in FQ-resistant MTB strains. There
are, however, no data on the association of mutations in
gyrA/gyrB and FQ resistance levels in MTB isolates.
Only Yin et al. have shown conclusively that different
substitutions of amino acid 94 resulted in different levels
of levofloxacin resistance [17].
In this study, mutations of gyrA were proven to be the
cause of primary OFX-resistance, but an analysis of relationships between different amino acid mutations in
gyrA and the MICs of OFX-resistant MTB strains by
ANOVA showed no significant differences among the
different mutants. This suggests that different amino
acid substitutions at codons 90, 91 or 94 in gyrA bring
the similar level of OFX-resistance in MTB strains, but
do not contribute different level of OFX-resistance. Sun
et al [29] detected the OFX MICs of laboratory-selected
OFX-resistant MTB strains but did not analyze the

Cui et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2011, 11:78
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/11/78

relationship between different amino acid mutations in
gyrA and the MICs of OFX-resistant MTB strains. We
did this analysis for laboratory-selected OFX-resistant
MTB strains and clinical isolates by ANOVA based on
the data from their study. Our analysis showed no significant difference in the relationship between the
amino acid substitution and the OFX MIC for both
laboratory-selected OFX-resistant MTB strains (F =
0.091, p = 0.997) and clinical isolates (F = 2.023, p =
0.080). This is consistent with our findings in this study.
However, the conclusions from both this study and the
one by Sun et al. were made on only the single amino
acid modification in gyrA in OFX-resistant isolates.
The relationship between two concurrent amino acid
mutations in gyrA and the MICs of OFX-resistant
MTB strains needs to be further investigated. Our
findings differed from the results of the study by Yin
et al. [13], which may have been due to the different
optical conformation of OFX and levofloxacin leading
to different mechanisms by which OFX and levofloxacin bind to DNA gyrase A. In this study, the gyrA
S95T was detected in all OFX-susceptible isolates and
OFX-resistant isolates as a natural polymorphism, and
in fact gyrA S95T is a phylogenetically informative
polymorphism [30].
Some reports have shown that a small number of FQresistant MTB isolates have mutations in the gyrB gene,
including those at codons 485, 486, 500, 509, 521, 538,
539, 540, 543 550 and 577, amongst others according to
the numbering system used in this study [10,16,17,31,32].
There were only a few gyrB mutations that were present
in FQ-susceptible MTB isolates and little evidence exists
to show that mutations in gyrB are related to FQ resistance. In this study, a 772 bp fragment of gyrB was
sequenced that included the codons in which mutations
have been reported [10,17,31,32]. Some reported mutations, such as R485C and D500N [16,17], were also identified in OFX-resistant MTB strains in this study, but
weren’t detected in OFX-susceptible strains. Moreover,
two OFX-resistant MTB strains in this study only carry
mutations in gyrB at codons 485 and 500, respectively,
but not in gyrA; the same mutations were found in MTB
clinical isolates from Uzbekistan, Vietnam and Thailand
[16,17,31]. In this study, the OFX-resistant MTB strain
with a mutation at codon 539 in gyrB had a mutation
A90V in gyrA, which was also the case in Vietnam [17].
This suggested there may be a potential relationship
between these two mutations in gyrA and gyrB in the
mechanism of MTB resistance to OFX. This evidence
also suggests that mutations at codons 485, 500 and 539
induce resistance to OFX.
The R485L mutation found in this study differed from
the R485C mutation described by Feuerriegel et al. [17],
which had polymorphisms within codon 485. In this

Page 4 of 5

current study, the novel mutation of codon 551 was identified in both OFX-resistant and OFX-susceptible MTB
strains and the novel codon 549 mutation was identified
in gyrB in OFX-susceptible MTB strains, which supported the hypothesis that the mutations at codons 549
and 551 are not related to OFX resistance in MTB
strains. Although the data from this study suggested that
the mutations at codons 549 and 551 seemed not to lead
to the resistance to OFX in MTB isolates, it was not possible to hypothesize whether the same mutations would
have importance in the resistance of other FQs. For
example, one strain that has a N533T mutation in gyrB,
was susceptible to OFX but resistant to moxifloxacin and
gatifloxacin in the study by Groll et al [32]. Although the
mutation sites in gyrB that relate to FQ resistance are
still unclear in MTB strains, the present data show that
OFX-resistant strains with mutations only in gyrA do not
differ from OFX-resistant MTB strains with mutations in
both gyrA and gyrB. In this study, the relationships
between mutations in gyrB and OFX resistance in MTB
isolates remain hypothetical. We are currently performing experiments, including cloning mutations in the
reference strains, which will verify the effect of gyrB
mutations on OFX resistance in MTB strains.

Conclusions
Our findings confirm that the susceptibility or resistance
to OFX of most MTB strains can be determined by
mutations in the QRDRs of gyrA and gyrB, but the level
of resistance to OFX for OFX-resistant isolates could
not be predicted based on the mutation patterns in the
gyrA and gyrB genes. Furthermore, our findings indicate
that not all the patterns of mutation in genes related to
drugs reflect the resistance level of the corresponding
drug for MTB drug-resistant isolates, whereas the patterns of gene mutations related to rifampicin and isoniazid resistance did reflect the resistance level of other
drugs.
