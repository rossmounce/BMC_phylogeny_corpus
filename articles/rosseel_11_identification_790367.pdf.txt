of paramyxoviruses in mallard ducks (Anas
platyrhynchos) using random access amplification
and next generation sequencing technologies

Abstract
Background: During a wildlife screening program for avian influenza A viruses (AIV) and avian paramyxoviruses
(APMV) in Belgium, we isolated two hemagglutinating agents from pools of cloacal swabs of wild mallards (Anas
platyrhynchos) caught in a single sampling site at two different times. AIV and APMV1 were excluded using
hemagglutination inhibition (HI) testing and specific real-time RT-PCR tests.
Methods: To refine the virological identification of APMV2-10 realized by HI subtyping tests and in lack of
validated molecular tests for APMV2-10, random access amplification was used in combination with next
generation sequencing for the sequence independent identification of the viruses and the determination of their
genomes.
Results: Three different APMVs were identified. From one pooled sample, the complete genome sequence (15054
nucleotides) of an APMV4 was assembled from the random sequences. From the second pooled sample, the
nearly complete genome sequence of an APMV6 (genome size of 16236 nucleotides) was determined, as well as a
partial sequence for an APMV4. This APMV4 was closely related but not identical to the APMV4 isolated from the
first sample. Although a cross-reactivity with other APMV subtypes did not allow formal identification, the HI
subtyping revealed APMV4 and APMV6 in the respective pooled samples but failed to identify the co-infecting
APMV4 in the APMV6 infected pool.
Conclusions: These data further contribute to the knowledge about the genetic diversity within the serotypes
APMV4 and 6, and confirm the limited sensitivity of the HI subtyping test. Moreover, this study demonstrates the
value of a random access nucleic acid amplification method in combination with massive parallel sequencing.
Using only a moderate and economical sequencing effort, the characterization and full genome sequencing of
APMVs can be obtained, including the identification of viruses in mixed infections.

Background
A large number of viruses of humans and animals are
classified in the family Paramyxoviridae [1]. Their single
stranded, unsegmented, RNA genomes of negative
orientation vary in length from 13-19 kb and contain 610 genes encoding up to 12 different proteins [1]. Avian
paramyxoviruses (APMV) are frequently isolated from

domestic and wild birds throughout the world. Recently
they are classified in the genus Avulavirus of the subfamily Paramyxovirinae, family Paramyxoviridae [2].
Ten serological types (APMV1-10) of APMVs are
described so far based on hemagglutination inhibition
(HI) and neuraminidase inhibition tests [3-5]. APMV1,
including Newcastle disease virus (NDV, defined in [6])
is the most characterized among all APMV types
because it can cause severe disease outbreaks in poultry.
In contrast to the well-studied APMV1 or NDV, very

little is known about the biological characteristics,
pathogenicity, and diversity (both genetic and antigenic)
of other APMV serotypes 2-10. APMV types 2, 3, 6 and
7 have been associated with disease in domestic poultry
[7-13]. APMV6 viruses have been associated with mild
respiratory disease and decreased egg production in turkeys [14]. APMV3 and APMV5 (Kunitachi virus) caused
severe pulmonary disease in wild birds [15,16]. Other
serotypes, including APMV4, 8, 9 and 10 have been isolated from ducks, waterfowls, and other wild birds with
no clinical signs of disease [3,5,17-20]. APMV4 viruses
have been isolated predominantly from feral birds of the
order Anseriformes [21,22] and from commercial ducks
and geese, presumably as a result of their direct contact
with feral waterfowl [21,23,24]. Experimental infection
of chickens with APMV4 and APMV6 showed mild
respiratory pathology, suggestive of possible viral disease
in poultry [8,25].
Molecular characterization through whole genome
sequencing of APMV2-10 remains technically challenging because these viruses are poorly represented in
public sequence databases, complicating the design of
sequencing primers. Recent efforts to sequence whole
genomes of representative strains for all serotypes
(APMV2 [26], APMV3 [27,28], APMV4 [29,30], APMV5
[31], APMV6 [25,32], APMV7 [33], APMV8 [34],
APMV9 [35], APMV10 [5]) have significantly contributed to our understanding of the Avulavirus genus genome organisation. However, further studies are needed
to explore the diversity within the serotypes.
Random access sequencing using sequence independent single primer amplification was previously
described for NDV genome sequencing [36], based on
resource demanding sequencing of high number of
cloned random amplicons to achieve completion of a
genome. This protocol contains efficient steps to enrich
viral nucleic acids and deplete contaminating and host
sequences, including size selective filtration and extensive nuclease treatments [36,37]. It was also used for the
molecular identification of an APMV in penguins [5]
where existing protocols did not allow a starting point
for primer walking. This resulted in the identification of
a new serotype, APMV10.
Massive parallel sequencing technologies were developed to accommodate the need of higher sequencing
capacity and lower costs per nucleotide for large genome
sequencing projects [38]. One main advantage of these
second generation sequencing technologies is the possibility to sequence DNA samples without any prior knowledge of the sequence, which is required for priming [38].
During a wildlife screening program for avian influenza A viruses (AIV) and APMVs, we isolated two
hemagglutinating agents from two pools consisting of
each four cloacal swabs of wild mallards. The birds were

caught in a same location at two different times. AIV
and APMV1 were excluded using HI testing and specific
real-time RT-PCR tests. To refine HI test based identification of these viruses and in lack of validated molecular
tests for APMV2-10, this study applied random access
amplification in combination with next generation
sequencing for the sequence independent identification
of the viruses and the determination of their complete
genome sequences.

Results
Identification and genome sequence of avian
paramyxoviruses

Two pooled samples, consisting of each four swab samples from wild mallards, were positive for hemagglutinating agents without inducing mortality of embryonated
chicken eggs. AIV and APMV1 could be excluded using
specific real-time RT-PCR tests (data not shown) and HI
tests using reference sera for AIV and APMV1. The HI
assays with reference sera specific for APMV2-9 identified sample mallard/Belgium/15129/07 as APMV4 positive and sample mallard/Belgium/12245/07 as APMV6
positive. A cross reactivity with the APMV2 reference
serum P/Robin/Hiddensee/57 was observed for both
samples, but not with another APMV2 reference serum
P/chicken/Yucaipa/Cal/56. The HI titers for the APMV3
and APMV7 reference sera showed for sample mallard/
Belgium/15129/07 the borderline value of 16, still we
considered this as nonspecific reactivity (Table 1).
Combining the advantages of random amplification
and massive parallel sequencing, 5225 and 12310
sequence reads were produced from the library resulting
respectively from sample mallard/Belgium/12245/07 and
mallard/Belgium/15129/07. More than 95% of these
reads were specific for APMVs, and host-derived or
contaminating sequences were negligible.
Assembly of random generated sequences for sample
mallard/Belgium/15129/07 produced a 15054 nucleotides (nt) contig representing the complete genome
sequence of an APMV4. APMV4/mallard/Belgium/
15129/07 (APMV4-BE15129) was assembled from 9767
sequence reads of raw data (APMV4/KR/YJ/06 [GenBank:EU877976] used as reference in the reference
assembly). Assembly of 4715 sequences generated for
sample mallard/Belgium/12245/07 produced a nearly
complete (98.89%) APMV6 genome of length 16236 nt
(APMV6/mallard/Belgium/12245/07; APMV6-BE12245).
APMV6/Goose/FarEast/4440/2003 [GenBank:EF569970]
was used as a reference sequence in this reference
assembly. Surprisingly, APMV4 sequences were also
identified in sample mallard/Belgium/12245/07.
APMV4/KR/YJ/06 [GenBank:EU877976] was used as a
reference and 21 sequences mapped to various regions
(total of 2977 nt representing 19.75% of the APMV4

The virus has a genome length of 15054 nt as previously
described for APMV4 viruses, consisting of six transcriptional units (Table 2) encoding from 3’ to 5’ the NP
(nucleoprotein), P/V/W (phosphoprotein and additional
proteins through RNA editing), M (matrix), F (fusion),
HN (hemagglutinin-neuraminidase) and L (large polymerase) proteins. The 3’ leader and 5’ trailer sequences
of the genome were respectively 55 nt and 17 nt in
length. Gene start and gene end sequences were as previously described for APMV4 [30]. The NP protein
encoded a 457 amino acids (aa) protein, as previously
described for other APMV4. The P gene encodes a 393
aa phosphoprotein. A putative RNA editing site at genome position 2057-2065 (5’AAAGGGGGG-3’) was identified, where insertion of one non-templated G residue
would encode a 224 aa V protein. Alternatively, the
insertion of two non-templated G residues would result
in a putative W protein of 137 aa. The matrix gene
open reading frame (ORF) encodes a 370 aa long matrix
protein, unlike the 367 aa or 369 aa previously described
for APMV4 genomes [29,30]. The lengths of the other
proteins encoded by their ORF’s are the same as previously described for APMV4 (F 566 aa; HN 569 aa; L
2211 aa). The fusion protein has a monobasic cleavage
site (DIQPR↓F).

genome sequence). The APMV4 virus was named
APMV4/mallard/Belgium/12245/07 (APMV4-BE12245).
Unfortunately the original individual cloacal swabs were
no longer available at the time of the genetic analysis, so
we could not find out which of the four animals in the
pool were infected and whether we were dealing with a
mixed infection of one bird. The missing 1.11% of the
APMV6 genome represents two small internal gaps and
some nucleotides (24 nt at 5’ and 37 nt at 3’) at the genome termini. A low coverage at the genome termini was
also observed for the fully sequenced APMV4 genome
(41 terminal 5’ nt and 42 terminal 3’ nt, with depth ≤ 3×).
Database accession numbers

The consensus sequences were submitted to GenBank
under the following accession numbers: JN571485
(APMV4/mallard/Belgium/15129/07, complete genome),

Genomic features of APMV6/mallard/Belgium/12245/07

The genome length of 16236 nt is consistent with that of
“class I” of APMV6 [32], containing seven transcriptional
units (Table 3) encoding from 3’ to 5’ the NP, P/V/W, M,
F, SH (small hydrophobic protein), HN and L proteins.
The F protein has a monobasic cleavage site, PEPR↓L.
The 3’ leader and 5’ trailer sequences of the genome were
respectively 55 and 54 nt in length. Gene start and gene
end sequences were as previously described for APMV6

Phylogenetic analysis based on F and HN proteins

Phylogenetic trees based on amino acid sequence alignments of the F and HN proteins clearly classify
APMV4-BE15129 and APMV6-BE12245 within respectively serotype APMV4 and APMV6 (Figure 1 and 2).
APMV6-BE12245 is most closely related to the “class I”
of APMV6 viruses described by Xiao and colleagues
[32]. This is confirmed by its high whole genome
nucleotide sequence identity with APMV6/Goose/FarEast/4440/2003 (GenBank:EF569970; Table 4). The F and
HN amino acid sequences of APMV4-BE15129 are most
closely related to APMV4/KR/YJ/06 (GenBank:
EU877976), which is confirmed by a high whole genome
nucleotide homology to this virus (Table 5). APMV4BE15129 is more closely related to both previously
sequenced APMV4 whole genomes than these are to
each other (Table 5).
Although no complete F and HN sequences were
available for APMV4-BE12245 (in sample with APMV6BE12245), we included the partial sequence information
in the phylogenetic analysis using pairwise deletion of
positions with gaps and missing data. This may have
resulted in biased distance estimations. However, there
are clear indications that although it is most closely
related to APMV4- BE15129, it is not identical. This is
also evident from nucleotide sequence identity calculated over all available sequence information (2977 nt)
for the partial genome APMV4-BE12245 (Table 6). The
partial sequence APMV4-BE12245 is 98.4% identical to
APMV4- BE15129 considering all positions allowed by
the partial sequence of APMV-BE12245. In contrast, its
identity with previously sequenced APMV4 genomes is
only 97.5% (APMV4/KR/YJ/06; GenBank:EU877976)
and 90.9% (APMV4/duck/Hong Kong/D3/75; GenBank:
FJ177514).

Discussion
Wild birds are increasingly recognized as a reservoir for
important livestock diseases. This has been extensively
shown for avian influenza A viruses (AIV) and to a lesser degree for avian paramyxoviruses of serotype 1
(APMV1). Moreover, other viruses, including APMV210 have been shown to circulate in wild birds. Some of
these viruses have been shown to infect poultry species
and induced major outbreaks in flocks.
Apart from the well-characterized serotype APMV1
associated with the economically important Newcastle
disease in poultry, knowledge of the antigenic and
genetic diversity in the APMV serotypes of the genus
Avulavirus is limited. The determination of complete
genome sequences of an additional APMV4 and
APMV6 widens our understanding of the genetic diversity in these serotypes. Interestingly, we could identify
two different viruses from single pooled samples. In one
tested pool of four cloacal swabs, taken in beginning of
September, at least one of the four animals was infected
with an APMV4. In the other tested pool, taken at the
end of this month in the same capture location, two different APMV serotypes APMV6 and APMV4 were identified. The latter APMV4, although closely related to the
APMV4 in the first pool, was not identical to it. Contamination artifacts during virus isolation are very unlikely to have occurred as the two APMV4 viruses
characterized in this study are not identical based on
the sequence information (2977 nt partial sequence of
APMV4-BE12245) obtained, and no other APMV4
viruses were manipulated in the laboratory.
It is difficult to assess whether both APMV4 viruses
characterized in this study fall within the normal range of
quasispecies genetic variation. This is because of the limited availability of sequence information for this serotype
and the lack of studies investigating the genetic variability
within circulating populations of paramyxoviruses. To
prove the economic feasibility of the method of random
amplification combined with deep sequencing, the number of sequence reads per sample was intentionally kept

below 10 000 in this study. This turned out to be sufficient for the completion of the APMV4 genome in one
pool. In the mixed APMV infected pool, this number of
reads did not allow the determination of the last 1.11% of

the APMV6 genome because part of the sequencing
effort resulted in 19.75% of the genome of a co-infecting
APMV4. Most probably, the APMV4 virus was present
in a lower amount in the original samples, and a higher

number of sequence reads would have resulted in completion of the APMV6 genome. However, we cannot fully
exclude preferential growth of either virus during virus
isolation or a slight bias in our random amplification

protocol. This means that quantitative statements about
the relative presence of either virus in the original pooled
sample based on the distribution of sequence reads are
not possible. As the original swabs were no longer

Sites with missing data were deleted from the alignment

another APMV2 reference serum P/chicken/Yucaipa/
Cal/56 did not show cross reactivity with these samples,
which makes the HI subtyping interpretation difficult. In
the context of mixed infections, where it’s likely that
one virus has a higher concentration than the other,
genetic information seems more informative for the
identification. Further studies are obviously needed to
gain insight in the genetic and antigenic diversity of
APMV2-10.
Recently Xiao and colleagues [32] increased the
amount of whole genome sequences available for
APMV6 to six, identifying two classes with APMV6.
APMV6 class I isolates differed less than five % from
each other but differed 29-31% to the single class II isolate IT4524-2. The additional APMV6 genome identified
in this study clustered within class I, maintaining the
separation with class II (31% distance) while slightly
increasing the genetic diversity within class I to a maximum of 8% distance.
On the other hand, whole genome sequences of only
two representative strains of APMV4 have been
reported so far [29,30]. The complete genome of
APMV4-BE15129 determined in this study further
extends our knowledge of this serotype. This additional
APMV4 complete genome does not increase the maximum genetic distance previously documented within the
APMV4 serotype. The genetic distance now ranges from
two to eight % nucleotide sequence distance (based on
only three complete genome sequences). The amount of
sequence data compared to APMV1 remains low and
further studies are needed to get a better estimate of
genetic diversity within serotypes APMV2-10. The
sequencing methodology used in this study may facilitate this.
The genome length of 15054 nt for APMV4 and
16236 nt for APMV6 complies with the ‘rule of six’ for
efficient genome replication of Paramyxovirinae [40].

available, we could not determine (1) in which proportion
the two viruses were present in the original sample/pool
before the propagation in eggs, (2) which of the four animals in the pool were infected and (3) whether we were
dealing with a mixed infection of one bird. Moreover, the
analytical sensitivity of the method remains to be determined and may limit the applicability to field samples
containing relatively high virus titers. The presented
methodology has the potential to identify viruses present
in minor proportions in a pooled sample, and mixed
infections in single samples. Clearly our methodology,
using a sequence independent methodology for genome
determination, has allowed the detection of sequence
information from both viruses without bias. In contrast,
the use of serotype specific tests such as HI or serotype
specific PCR methods may fail to characterize the full
complexity of an isolate. Further passage of “double isolates” may give a selective advantage to either virus, changing the biological properties of the isolate, as was
suggested by Shihmanter and colleagues [39]. They
described that an APMV1 had a selective advantage over
co-infecting APMV viruses during passaging in embryonated chicken eggs.
Our genetic identification of the APMVs revealed
some difficulties in the HI based identification of
APMVs other than APMV1. The APMV6 reference
serum did detect the APMV6 virus in sample 07/12245
(titer 1/64) and the APMV4 reference serum detected
the APMV4 virus in sample 07/15129 (titer 1/128).
However, the HI test failed to detect the APMV4 virus
co-present at low titer with the APMV6 virus in pooled
sample 07/12245. This most likely indicates that our
molecular method is much more sensitive to the identification of viruses present at very low concentrations.
Additionally, a cross reactivity with the APMV2 reference serum P/Robin/Hiddensee/57 was observed for
both samples (titer 1/32 or 1/64 - Table 1). However

Sites with missing data were deleted from the alignment

The genomic characteristics and genome organizations,
including putative mRNA editing of the P gene, are as
previously described for APMV4 and APMV6 genomes
[29,30,32,33]. Further variability in protein length of the
APMV4 M protein was shown. Variability in the intergenic sequence length, as is known for the genus Avulavirus, was also confirmed here. A monobasic fusion
protein cleavage site was present in both viruses. However, fusion protein cleavage site sequences in APMV2-9
are not necessarily predictive of protease activation phenotype [33], as it is in Newcastle disease virus [41].
Interestingly, the terminal amino acid of the fusion protein cleavage site of APMV4/mallard/Belgium/15129/07
is a phenylalanine. As previously shown for other
APMV4 [29,30], this did not require an exogenous exonuclease for in vitro replication on chicken embryonic
fibroblasts [29]. A phenylalanine at this position is
known to contribute to the in vitro growth characteristics and in vivo pathogenicity of velogenic Newcastle
disease [4]. Further in vivo and in vitro phenotypic characterization of this virus would be interesting.
This study clearly demonstrates the value of a sequencing strategy combining next generation sequencing and
random access amplification for the identification and
whole genome determination of APMVs. Although the
method allows sequencing of complete APMV genomes,
an unequal distribution of sequencing depth results in
low coverage at the genome termini when only a modest
sequencing effort is applied. Efforts to optimize the
homogenous distribution of sequencing reads along the
genome and to determine the optimal sequencing effort
for reproducible whole genome sequencing, could
further improve the applicability of the method. Previous studies determining complete genomes of
APMV2-9 often relied on a round of amplification using
degenerated or custom designed oligonucleotides, followed by primer walking [29,31-35]. The use of random
access amplification alleviates the problem of oligonucleotide design in a context of poor representation in
sequence databases. Moreover, it allows for the identification of potential co-infection with other APMVs or
other viruses without methodological bias. Sequence
independent single primer amplification (SISPA) was
originally described by Reyes and Kim [42]. It was later

modified to include enrichment steps for viral nucleic
acids using filtration and nuclease treatment (DNaseSISPA, [36,37]). Miller and colleagues [5] used a similar
approach for the identification and sequencing of a new
serotype of APMV10 in penguins. Unlike their method,
that relied on the molecular cloning and sequencing of
hundreds of random amplicons, this study used the
power of next generation to provide the necessary
sequence information. The preparation of a next generation sequencing library includes the process of emulsion
PCR, which isolates single DNA molecules on beads and
clonally amplifies them ([38], reviewed in [43]). There is
no longer a need for molecular cloning and the generated random amplicons can directly be processed in the
sequencing library workflow. An additional advantage is
that this methodology avoids biological biases induced
by the virological analysis of mixed infections.

Conclusion
Within a single sampling location, three different
APMVs were identified in wild mallards using random
access amplification in combination with next generation sequencing. From one pooled sample, the complete
genome sequence of an APMV4 was assembled from
the random sequences. From a second pooled sample,
the nearly complete genome sequence of an APMV6
(genome size of 16236 nt) was determined, as well as a
partial sequence for an APMV4 closely related but not
identical to the APMV4 virus isolated from the first
sample.
These data further contribute to the knowledge about
the genetic diversity within serotypes APMV4 and
APMV6. Moreover, this study demonstrates the value of
a random access nucleic acid amplification method in
combination with massive parallel sequencing for the
characterization and full genome sequencing of APMVs.
Moreover, the sequence independent nature of this
method allows the detection of potential co-infections
with other viruses and is applicable to other viruses.
Methods
Viruses

Two non-characterized APMVs (mallard/Belgium/
12245/07 and mallard/Belgium/15129/07) were isolated

Rosseel et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:463
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/463

from two pools consisting of each four cloacal swabs
from healthy wild mallard ducks according to standard
diagnostic procedures (OIE, diagnostic manual 2005/94/
CE). The wild birds were caught in a funnel trap located
along a pond at 20 km SE of Brussels in Belgium. The
trap was visited every two to three days during the
entire survey period. All new birds were ringed,
weighted, the wings measured, and a cloacal swab was
collected. A maximum of four cloacal swabs from the
same bird species, sex and sampling time were pooled
for laboratory analysis.
HI-tests

Briefly, the hemagglutination (HA) titer of the different
viruses was standardized to a concentration of four units
of HA activity/25 μl to perform the test (methodology
according to Council Directive 92/66/EC (1992)). All HI
tests referenced in this study were conducted with the
AIV and APMV1-9 reference sera provided by the European reference laboratory VLA (Weybridge, U.K.). The
titer of a serum is defined by the last dilution giving a
complete inhibition of HA. A titer below 16 is considered
as negative and a titer above or equal to 16 is considered
as positive. Absence of APMV1 was confirmed using specific real-time RT-PCR assays (data not shown).
Random access to viral nucleic acids using DNAse I SISPA

Virus particles from samples mallard/Belgium/12245/07
and mallard/Belgium/15129/07 were purified starting
from one ml of allantoic fluid. This was first centrifuged
at 3, 200 × g for 15 minutes at four°C to remove cell
debris. The supernatants were then filtered at 3, 000 × g
for eight minutes or longer at four°C (200 μl/filter)
using 0.22 μM filters (Ultrafree-MC GV sterile, Millipore) to remove remaining cell fragments and bacteria.
The resulting eluates were subsequently subjected to
nuclease treatment with 100 U of DNase I (New England Biolabs) at 37°C for one hour to remove all nucleic
acids that are not protected within virions. The resulting
virion-enriched samples were used for viral RNA extraction using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Sequence independent single primer amplification
(SISPA) was performed essentially as previously
described [36] with some modifications. Briefly, the
extracted RNA was converted into single-stranded
cDNA using the Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche) and one μM (final concentration) random primer FR26RV-N (5’GCC GGA GCT CTG CAG
ATA TCN NNN NN 3’, [36,37]). Ten μl extracted RNA
was denatured at 95°C for five minutes in the presence
of primer FR26RV-N, immediately followed by cooling
on ice. The remaining reagents were added. The 20 μl
reaction mix contained 1× Transcriptor Reverse

Page 9 of 11

Transcriptase Reaction Buffer, dNTP mix (1 mM final
concentration each), 20 U Protector RNase Inhibitor,
ten units Transcriptor Reverse Transcriptase and one μl
PCR-grade H2O. The reaction was incubated at 25°C for
ten minutes followed by 50°C for 60 minutes. After a
reverse transcriptase inactivation step at 85°C for five
minutes and chilling on ice, 2.5 U of 3’-5’ exo- Klenow
Fragment of DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs)
were added for second strand synthesis using random
primer FR26RV-N for one hour at 37°C. An enzyme
inactivation step was performed at 75°C for ten minutes.
Five microliters of the reaction mix was used as template for a subsequent PCR amplification. The 50 μl
reaction mix consisted of 1× AmpliTaq Gold® 360 DNA
buffer, 2.5 mM MgCl2, dNTP mix (0.2 mM final concentration each), 2.5 U AmpliTaq Gold® 360 DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems), 32.7 μl RNase free water
and 1.6 μM FR20RV primer (5’-GCC GGA GCT CTG
CAG ATA TC-3’, [36,37]). This PCR primer is complementary to the amplification tag of FR26RV. The reaction was incubated at 95°C for ten minutes, 40 cycles at
95°C for one minute, 48°C for one minute and 72°C for
two minutes followed by a final elongation for seven
minutes at 72°C.
The random amplified DNA fragments were visualised
on a one % agarose gel. Fragments of 400-1000 base
pairs (bp) were excised and purified from the gel with
the High Pure PCR Product Purification Kit (Roche).
The purified PCR fragments were quantified by spectrophotometry (Nanodrop-1000).
Sequencing

Five micrograms of size selected (400-1000 bp) purified
random amplified DNA was sequenced on a GS FLX
(Roche, Mannheim, Germany) by the Genomics Core of
the University Hospital, University of Leuven, Belgium.
They used multiplex identifier (MID) identification during library preparation (standard Roche MID tag
sequences) and GS FLX Titanium series reagents
(Roche, Mannheim, Germany) according to their standard procedures, aiming for 5000-10000 reads per
library. Briefly, adaptors including standard MID tag
sequences (for our samples RL3 and RL10) were ligated
to the size selected double stranded DNA library (Rapid
Library Preparation Method Manual, GS FLX Titanium
Series reagents, Roche, Mannheim, Germany), followed
by single stranded DNA library isolation and library
quality assessment and quantitation. The resulting
libraries were then pooled with other MID identified
libraries and emulsion PCR clonal amplification was
performed as described by the provider. The amplified
libraries were then loaded on a Pico Titer Plate for
sequencing by the Genome Sequencer FLX. Data were
provided to the authors by secured ftp-server.

DATA Analysis

The obtained raw sequence data were assembled using
SeqMan NGen® version 3.0 (DNASTAR, Madison, WI,
USA). The reads were trimmed to remove primer
sequences as well as low quality ends. Standard assembling and filtering parameters were used. First we performed a de novo assembly and entered the resulting
contigs (i.e. sets of overlapping sequence reads) into a
Blastn similarity search against public sequence databases (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi; [44]) for
identification. When we identified a certain APMV serotype, we used the blast hit with the highest identity of
the biggest APMV contig as reference genome for a
subsequent reference assembly with the same raw data
set. The resulting reference assembly was used to obtain
a complete genome consensus sequence. The sequence
reads contributing to the consensus were also checked
for variability. When at a certain position along the consensus two different nucleotides were present, the variability was indicated as an ambiguous nucleotide when
the minor nucleotide exceeded the threshold of one
third of the reads.
Analysis of the virus specificity of the protocol

Sequences failing to align with the used reference genome were subjected to a metagenomics assembly in
SeqMan NGen. The obtained contigs containing more
than two sequence reads were identified with megablast http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi. Sequences
were classified as previously described [36]. Briefly,
viral blast results were considered reliable if the best
hit had an E-value less than 10-25. Non-viral sequences
were identified as Gallus gallus (chicken embryos were
used for virus isolation), other birds, bacteria, ... if
their best hit was below an E-value of 10-10. If no blast
results were found or the E-value was below the 10-10
cut off value, the sequences were not given a specific
designation.
Phylogenetic analysis

Consensus sequences were edited, aligned and translated, and sequence identities were calculated using
Bioedit v 7.0.5.3 http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/bioedit/bioedit.html[45]. Nucleotide (nt) sequence identities with
selected complete genome sequences were determined
(GenBank accession codes: EU877976, FJ177514,
EF569970, NC003043, GQ406232, EU622637). Amino
acid (aa) alignments (ClustalW algorithm) using all
available complete coding sequences for the F and HN
genes of APMV4 (GenBank accession codes FJ177514,
EU877976) and APMV6 (GenBank accession codes
EF569970, NC003043, EU622637, GQ406234,
GQ406233) and selected sequences representative of
other APMV serotypes (GenBank accession codes

bootstrap analysis (1000 replicates) using the neighbourjoining of the Poisson-corrected values for aa differences. All positions containing alignment gaps and missing data were eliminated only in pairwise sequence
comparisons, allowing the inclusion of the incomplete
