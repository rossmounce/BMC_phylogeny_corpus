Abstract
Background: Vertebrate classic cadherins are divided into type I and type II subtypes, which are
individually expressed in brain subdivisions (e.g., prosomeres, rhombomeres, and progenitor
domains) and in specific neuronal circuits in region-specific manners. We reported previously the
expression of cadherin19 (cad19) in Schwann cell precursors. Cad19 is a type II classic cadherin
closely clustered on a chromosome with cad7 and cad20. The expression patterns of cad7 and
cad20 have been reported previously in chick embryo but not in the developing and adult central
nervous system of mammals. In this study, we identified rat cad7 and cad20 and analyzed their
expression patterns in embryonic and adult rat brains.
Results: Rat cad7 protein showed 92% similarity to chick cad7, while rat cad20 protein had 76%
similarity to Xenopus F-cadherin. Rat cad7 mRNA was initially expressed in the anterior neural plate
including presumptive forebrain and midbrain regions, and then accumulated in cells of the dorsal
neural tube and in rhombomere boundary cells of the hindbrain. Expression of rat cad20 mRNA
was specifically localized in the anterior neural region and rhombomere 2 in the early neural plate,
and later in longitudinally defined ventral cells of the hindbrain. The expression boundaries of cad7
and cad20 corresponded to those of region-specific transcription factors such as Six3, Irx3 and Otx2
in the neural plate, and Dbx2 and Gsh1 in the hindbrain. At later stages, the expression of cad7 and
cad20 disappeared from neuroepithelial cells in the hindbrain, and was almost restricted to
postmitotic cells, e.g. somatic motor neurons and precerebellar neurons. These results emphasized
the diversity of cad7 and cad20 expression patterns in different vertebrate species, i.e. birds and
rodents.
Conclusion: Taken together, our findings suggest that the expression of cad7 and cad20
demarcates the compartments, boundaries, progenitor domains, specific nuclei and specific neural
circuits during mammalian brain development.

Background
In the early neural plate, the brain primodium is subdivided into several domains, i.e., neuromeres, to generate

regional differences and units [1]. The hindbrain primordium is morphologically divided into lineage-restricted
functional metameric units called rhombomeres [2]. NeuPage 1 of 19

roepithelial cells are initially scattered in the hindbrain
neuroepithelium, but are sorted gradually into each compartment [3]. In the forebrain, that consists of the diencephalon and telencephalon, the primordium is
longitudinally divided into prosomeres, which are
defined by the expression border of various transcription
factors such as homeodomain (HD) proteins [4,5], and a
lineage restriction of neuroepithelial cells between each
subdivision has been reported in the caudal diencephalon
of the chick embryo [6]. In each region of the hindbrain
and spinal cord, the neuroepithelium is also regionalized
into basal and alar plates, which are separated at a groove
called the sulcus limitans. Several molecular makers, e.g.,
HD transcription factors, subdivide the neuroepithelium
into several discrete progenitor domains that give rise to
different types of neurons along the dorsoventral (D-V)
axis [7].
Previous studies demonstrated the expression of cadherin
superfamily genes encoding cell adhesion molecules in
the brain and the spinal cord, with distinct expression patterns that correspond with the subdivisions of the brain
and the spinal cord [8-12]. These studies proposed that
cadherin-mediated differential cell affinity establishes various compartments and regionalizes the neuroepithelium. Vertebrate cadherin superfamily genes are
categorized into subfamilies, such as classic cadherins,
protocadherins, and desmosomal cadherins [13]. Classic
cadherins have cadherin-repeats in an extracellular region
called EC (extracellular cadherin) domain and associate
with β-catenin and p120-catein in the cytoplasmic
domains that connect to the actin cytoskeleton [13]. The
EC1 domain of classic cadherin shows adhesive properties
that enhance the homophilic binding of cadherin. Classic
cadherins are categorized into type I and type II groups
with or without conserved amino acids, His-Ala-Val
(HAV) within EC1 domain [14]. The adhesive affinities of
type I cadherins have been studied extensively. Cells
expressing single type I cadherin, such as E-cadherin or Ncadherin, prefer to adhere to those expressing the same
cadherin via homophilic interaction rather than heterophilic binding. For example, the neuroectoderm is segregated from the ectoderm by distinct affinity of N-cadherin
and E-cadherin during the formation of the neural tube
[15]. In contrast, R-cadherin and N-cadherin, which are
type I cadherins, interact in a heterophilic manner [16],
and the adhesive interaction between individual subtypes
of type II cadherin is not always homophilic in nature
[17]. Therefore, the complexity of homophilic and/or heterophilic interactions between each type II cadherin subtype may be involved in several developmental processes
beyond tissue segregation during early embryogenesis.
F-cadherin (F-cad), a member of type II classic cadherins,
is expressed in the area adjacent to the sulcus limitans, the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/8/87

boundary between the basal and alar plates, which
restricts positioning of neuroepithelial cells in Xenopus
embryos [18,19]. In the chick neural tube, cadherin7
(cad7) is expressed not only in migratory neural crest cells
but also in the domain ventral to the sulcus limitans of the
neural tube [20-22]. R-cadherin (R-cad) and cadherin6
(cad6) are expressed in the primodia of the mouse cerebral
cortex and striatum, respectively, and their differential cell
affinities mediate segregation at the corticostriatal boundary [23]. Other subtypes of classic cadherins also have
multiple functions in the developing and adult brain,
such as involvement in neuronal migration and connectivity of specific neuronal circuits, and synaptic formation
in the brain. For example, cad6, cad8 and cad11 are
observed in specific neural circuits [24,25], and α N-catenin and N-cadherin, which are localized in the pre- and
postsynaptic regions, modulate dendritic spine formation
in an activity-dependent manner [26]. So far, more than
20 members of type II classic cadherin have been identified. In Schwann cell precursors, we reported previously
the expression of rat cad19 gene [27], which is a type II
subtype clustered with cad7 and cad20 on chromosome
13. In mice, cad7 is expressed only in adult tissues [28],
whereas cad20, a F-cad homologue, is expressed in early
neural tissues [28,29]. However, little is known about the
expression patterns of cad7 and cad20 in the developing
and adult rodent brains. In this study, we focused on cad7
and cad20 genes and analyzed their expression patterns in
the developing and adult rat brains. The results showed
that the expression borders of cad7 and cad20 corresponded with those of regional compartments and
boundaries, which were marked with the expression of
region-specific transcription factors. Cad7 and cad20 were
also expressed in neurons of several nuclei that form the
cerebellar/precerebellar circuitry in the late embryonic
and adult hindbrain. The results suggest the contribution
of cad7 and cad20 in the formation of compartment/
boundary and specific neuronal circuitry in the rat hindbrain.

Results
Isolation of rat cad7 and cad20
To examine the expression of rodent homologues of chick
cad7 and Xenopus F-cad, we searched for rat genome
sequences orthologous to chick cad7 and Xenopus F-cad.
We found highly conserved sequences on rat chromosome 13p12 and cloned cDNAs covering open reading
frames (ORFs) of putative rat cad7 and cad20 proteins by
RT-PCR (Fig. 1A, B, Table 1). Classic cadherins consist of
EC domains (or cadherin repeats), a transmembrane
domain, and cytoplasmic domains. The putative ORF of
rat cad7 encoded 785 amino acids and the protein
showed 92% similarity with chick cad7 [20], and 96%
similarity with human cad7 [17,30] (Fig. 1A). The putative ORF of rat F-cad encoded 801 amino acids, and the

protein had 76% similarity with Xenopus F-cad [18] (Fig.
1A), 86% similarity with chick MN-cadherin (MN-cad)
[31,32] and 95% similarity with human CDH20, a homologue of F-cad [30] (Fig. 1A). β-catenin and p120 catenin
binding sites were conserved within the cytoplasmic
domains of rat cad7 and cad20 proteins, which showed
72% and 63% identities, respectively (Fig. 1A). The EC1
and EC2 domains of cad7 and cad20 proteins were highly
conserved with 82% identities (Fig. 1A). These results
indicate that our two-cloned type II classic cadherins are
homologues of chick cad7 and Xenopus F-cad.
Human CDH7, CDH19 and CDH20 genes are clustered
on chromosome18q22-p23 [30]. Accordingly, we examined whether similar gene clusters are conserved in the rat,
mouse and chick genomes. Cad7 and cad20 genes were
closely localized in the same chromosome with cad19
(Fig. 1B). It is noteworthy that in the chick genome, the
position of cad7, MN-cad and cad19 [33] gene cluster on
chromosome 2 is different from that of cad7 and cad20 on
human, rat, and mouse genomes (Fig. 1C, Table 1).
Region-specific expression of cad7 in the developing rat
embryo
We first examined the expression patterns of cad7 in the
rat embryos by whole mount in situ hybridization. Expression of cad7 mRNA appeared at the edge of the anterior
neural plate at embryonic day (E) 9.5–9.75 and in the lateral plate at the posterior region (Fig. 2A–C). At E10.5 (12
somites stage), rostral expression of cad7 was exclusive to
the presumptive forebrain, midbrain and caudal neural
tube, and then was strongly identified at the edge of the
neural plate, which corresponds to neural crest cells (Fig.
2D, D'). Cad7 was expressed in migrating neural crestderived cells in the cephalic region (Fig. 2D'), but disappeared at later stages. At E11.5, cad7 was expressed in the
rostral brain regions including the telencephalon, diencephalon and midbrain, and the sharp posterior border of
the expression apparently corresponded to the midbrain/

hindbrain boundary (MHB) (Fig. 2E). In the caudal hindbrain and the spinal cord, cad7 was expressed in the dorsal
neuroepithelium but no expression was noted in the roof
plate (Fig. 2F, G). Cad7 expression also appeared in the
olfactory epithelium, retina, dorsal area of the otic vesicle
and the pharyngeal groove at E11.5 (Fig. 2E). At E12.0, the
pattern of cad7 expression was similar to that at E11.5
(Fig. 2H). At E12.5, cad7 expression extended to the cerebral cortex, the diencephalon including the presumptive
pretectum (p1), thalamus (p2) and prethalamus (p3),
and the dorsal midbrain (Fig. 2I). Immunostaining of the
chick diencephalon with antibody against cad7 showed
that cad7 expression demarcated the pretectum, ventral
thalamus and the zona limitans intrathalamica (ZLI) but
not the dorsal thalamus [34], suggesting that the cad7expressing diencephalic region is not conserved in ZLI and
dorsal thalamus in the rat and chick. Previous studies
demonstrated the expression of cad7 in chick neural crestderived cells including Schwann cells and their precursors
[20,21]. In E12.5 rat embryo, cad7 mRNA was undetectable in the dorsal root ganglia and neural crest-derived
migrating cells at the trunk level (Fig. 2J). We further
examined cad7 expression in Schwann cell precursors at
E14.5 [27]. We performed in situ hybridization on serial
sections for cad7 and Sox10, a maker of neural crestderived cells [35], and immunostaining of the same sections with β-tubulin antibody (Tuj1) to detect the nerve of
motor neurons (Fig. 2K–N). In contrast to the expression
of Sox10 in Schwann cell precursors on the motor nerve,
cad7 was not expressed in these cells (Fig. 2K and 2M).
These results suggest that rat cad7 gene is activated in the
central but not peripheral nervous system during neural
development.
Expression borders of cad7 and cad20 are adjacent to
those of transcription factors in the early neural plate
Since previous reports suggested cadherins expression in
specific regions corresponding to prosomere and rhombomere compartments [36,37], we next examined the

expression borders of cad7, cad20 and compared their
expressions with those of transcription factors showing
region-specific expression patterns at early development
stages. At E10.0 (6-somites stage), cad7 expression became
restricted to the anterior region including the forebrain
and caudal hindbrain (Fig. 3A). The anterior border of
cad7 in the hindbrain corresponded to that of Krox20 (Fig.
3B, C), a zinc-finger transcription factor, at rhombomere
3 (r3) [38]. The expression of cad20 was more restricted in
the anterior region and overlapped with the expression of
Six3 [39], a HD protein (Fig. 3D, E). A previous report
showed that the prospective position of the zona limitans
intrathalamica (ZLI) is demarcated by the expression
boundaries of Six3 and Irx3, HD transcription factors, in
the chick embryo [40]. Since the posterior border of cad20
expression was adjacent to the anterior border of Irx3 (Fig.
3F–H), cad20 expression indicates the prospective position of ZLI in the rat neural plate.
Next, we compared the expression domains of cad7 and
cad20 with those of transcription factors at E10.5 stage
(10–12 somite stage). Otx2 and Gbx2 are HD transcription factors that establish the MHB with mutual repression [41]. Remarkably, the posterior border of cad7
expression corresponded with the MHB (Fig. 3I, M). The
second domain of cad20 was identified in the hindbrain
in r2 region at areas positive for Gbx2 (Fig. 3K, L and 3N)
whilst the expression of Otx2 was excluded (Fig. 3J, N). At
E10.5, the posterior border of cad20 in the forebrain
became sharper (Fig. 3O). These results indicate that the
expression borders of cad7 and cad20 correspond to the
prosomere and rhombomere boundaries in the early neural plate.
Cad7 and cad20-expressing domains correspond to
progenitor domain boundary along the D-V axis
The hindbrain and spinal cord are subdivided into the
basal plate and alar plate, which give rise to both motor/
interneurons and interneurons, respectively. The boundary between these plates (known as the sulcus limitans) is
visualized as a groove at the apical surface of the neural
tube [42]. Previous reports suggested that the dorsal borders of Xenopus F-cad and chick cad7 correspond with the
position of the sulcus limitans as defined by HD transcription factors [18,19,22], suggesting that the basal/alar
boundary can be detected by differential expression of
type II cadherin subtypes as molecular makers. Therefore,
we investigated whether rat cad7 and cad20 mark the alar/
basal boundary and discrete progenitor domains in the
developing hindbrain. At E11.5 prior to differentiation of
interneurons [43], cad7 mRNA was expressed in dorsal
progenitor cells at r6-7 in the hindbrain (Fig. 4A), and
cad20 was longitudinally expressed in the midline of the
hindbrain neuroepithelium at r1-6 (Fig. 4C). To examine
the correlation between the expression domain and pro-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/8/87

genitor domains, which are subdivided by the different
expression patterns of HD proteins [7,43], we performed
in situ hybridization using probes for Gsh1 and Dbx2
[44,45]. Double staining for cad7 and Dbx2 in E11.5
embryos indicated that the ventral border of cad7 was
adjacent to the dorsal border of Dbx2-domain (Fig. 4B).
Although cad20 was somewhat expressed in the domain
ventral to Gsh1-domain, the dorsal border of cad20 overlapped with the Gsh1-domain (Fig. 4D).
Even at E12.5, the expression domain of cad7 was clearly
maintained in neuroepithelial cells in the dorsal hindbrain (Fig. 4E). The ventral border of cad7 coincided with
the dorsal border of Dbx2, and the cad7 domain partially
overlapped with the progenitor domains of the dorsal
Lbx1-expressing interneurons [46] (Fig. 4F–H). Remarkably, a narrow longitudinal stripe of cad20 expression
appeared in the ventral region of the hindbrain (Fig. 4I, J).
This pattern was similar to the ventral expression of cad20
in the mouse embryo [28]. To elucidate the relationship
between the expression domain of cad20 and the neural
progenitor domain, we compared the expression of cad20
with several progenitor domain markers. The results
showed similar expression patterns for transcription factor Gata2 in cad20 domain and the V2 interneuron progenitor domain (Fig. 4K, L) [47]. Cad20 expression was
also detected in BrdU-incorporated S-phase cells (Fig. 4L).
Taken together, these results suggest that cad7 and cad20
are expressed in different progenitor cells in the developing hindbrain.
Cad7 expression delineates rhombomere boundaries
In the hindbrain, cells at the interface between each rhombomere are specialized as rhombomere boundary cells.
Interestingly, the expression of cad7 was observed in the
rhombomere boundary regions (Fig. 5A), while cad20 was
continuously expressed along the r1–r7 with low level in
r7 at E11.5 (Fig. 5B). In the caudal hindbrain, the expression of cad7 was downregulated in the ventral domain
(Fig. 5A). In addition to longitudinal expression in the
middle domain throughout the r1-7, cad20 specifically
marked r4 at E11.5 (Fig. 5B). At E12.5, the cad7 expression
was restricted to the rhombomere boundaries and to the
dorsal region of the hindbrain (Fig. 5C). The transcripts of
cad7 were accumulated in the cell body of boundary cells
that are located in the apical side (Fig. 5E). The expression
of cad20 was restricted in the ventral domains of the hindbrain (Fig. 5D). These results suggest possible distinct
affinity of neuroepithelial cells mediated by cad7 and
cad20 in the developing rat hindbrain along the A-P axis.

F and G), and part of cad7-expressing progenitors gives rise to Lbx1-positive dorsal interneurons (Dl4-6) (H). The expression
of cad20 in the middle domain of the hindbrain gradually disappears at E12.5 (I), and another expression domain of cad20 also
appears in a more ventral region (arrow in I and J). K-L: BrdU detection after in situ hybridization. The domain of cad20expressing cells corresponds to that of cells expressing Gata2, a V2 interneuron lineage maker (brackets in K and L), and cad20

Islet1/2 in motor neurons, cad7 and cad20 were apparently expressed in the hypoglossal somatic motor nuclei
(nXII) (Fig. 6B, C, E). At E18.5, cad7 expression extended
beyond the nXII into the vagus motor nuclei (nX) (Fig.
6G). Cad20 was still expressed in the nXII at E18.5 (Fig.
6H). Cad7 was also expressed in the dorsal region includ-

ing the nucleus of solitary tract (Sol) and in the intermediate reticular zone (IRt) (Fig. 6G).
In the caudal hindbrain, the migratory stream to form

certain makers including HD transcription factors such as
Pax6 [49]. Pax6 is essential for the development of the cerebellum and formation of precerebellar nuclei [49-51]. At
E18.5, Pax6 was expressed in the external cuneate nucleus
(ECN) and the lateral reticular nucleus (LRT) (Fig. 6F, J,
L). Interestingly, cad7 transcripts were also detected in the
pes, ECN and LRT but not in the lower rhombic lip (LRL)
(Fig. 6G, K, M, O). Cad7 mRNA expression was also
detected in the cad6-expressing medial accessory olive
(MAO) [25] but not in other parts of the inferior olive
nucleus (IO) (Fig. 6I and 6G), and in the pontine nucleus

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/8/87

(PN) and the reticular nucleus (RT) (Fig. 6A, B and Fig.
7A, B). We demonstrated previously that XII motor nuclei,
ECN and PN were missing in the Pax6 homozygous
mutant rat (rSey2/rSey2) [51,52]. In fact, the expression of
cad7 was not detected in normal positions of the nXII,
ECN or PN of rSey2/rSey2 embryo, although the expression
was normally detected in LRT and MAO (Fig. 6P, Q, S and
Fig. 7D). Furthermore, cad20 expression in the normal
position of the nXII was not detected in rSey2/rSey2
embryo (Fig. 6R).

Cad7 expression in the external germinal layer of the
cerebellum
Next, we examined the expression of cad7 in the developing cerebellum. At E20.5, cad7 expression overlapped with
that of Pax6 in the external germinal layer (EGL) containing progenitors of granule cells that later migrate inwards
from EGL (Fig. 7A, B, E, F, M, N). On the other hand, cad7
expression was not detected in the upper rhombic lip
(URL) (Fig. 7F), but was identified in the deep cerebellar
nucleus and the epithelium of the anterior hindbrain (Fig.
7J and 7L), which differed from the expression of Pax6
(Fig. 7I and 7K). Previous studies in the chick cerebellum
at later embryonic stages have shown that cad7 transcripts
are restricted to the Purkinje cell layer and internal granular layer (IGL) and are not in the EGL [53], and that the
immunoreactivity of cad7 protein is absent in the ventricular zone of the developing cerebellum [54]. Considered together, the results suggest diversity of cad7
expression patterns in the chick and rat cerebellum.

It is has been reported that Pax6 regulates cell adhesion in
the cerebral cortex [55,56] and cerebellar granule cell precursors [57]. R-cadherin is a downstream gene of Pax6 in
the ventricular zone of the developing cerebral cortex
[55]. Cad7 expression was still detected in EGL cells of the
Pax6 homozygous mutant rat (Fig. 7D and 7H). These
results suggest that cad7 expression in EGL is regulated by
a Pax6-independent pathway.
Cad7 and cad20 expression in the adult brainstem and
cerebellum
In the adult brain, the precerebellar neurons and cerebellar granule cells make synaptic connections. Since cad7
was expressed in both precerebellar neurons and progenitors for granule cells, we examined its expression in these
neuronal cells in the brainstem and cerebellum of the
adult rat (Fig. 8). Cad7 was expressed in IGL, which contains granule cells, but not in Purkinje cells (Fig. 8E and
8G). We also observed scattered cells expressing cad7 at
high levels in IGL (Fig. 8G). Cad7 was also expressed in
PN and RT, ECN and LRT (Fig. 8I–P) but not in IO (Fig.
8M). On the other hand, cad20 was expressed in the IGL
but not in the precerebellar nucleus (Fig. 8F, H). The
expression of cad7 and cad20 in nX and nXII was maintained in adulthood (Fig. 8A and 8B). These results suggest that the expression of cad7 demarcates the
precerebellar/cerebellar system in both embryonic and
adult brain.

Discussion
Expression of cad7 and cad20 in early brain subdivision
Wizenmann and Lumsden analyzed rhombomere cells of
the chick embryo by re-aggregation assay and were the
first to report that segregation of rhombomere neuroepithelial cells between even and odd rhombomeres was

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/8/87

probably mediated by calcium-dependent molecules such
as cadherins [58]. However, the candidate cadherin molecules expressed in specific rhombomeres or rhombomere
boundary cells have not yet been identified in the chick
embryo. On the other hand, other studies reported R-cad
mRNA expression in the midbrain and odd number of
rhombomeres, as well as cad6 expression in even number
of rhombomeres in the mouse neural plate [36,37]. Interestingly, in our analysis, we found specific expression of
cad20 in the r2 of the rat embryo at E10.5 (Fig. 3) and that
the posterior limit of cad7 expression was consistent with
that of Otx2 at E10.5 (Fig. 3). Taking into consideration
the transient expression of R-cad and cad6 at early stages
and distinct cell adhesiveness of different cadherins, it is
conceivable that classic cadherin subtypes including
cad20 are involved in segregation of cells at the interface
between rhombomeres in rodent embryos. Taken
together, it is likely that distinct cadherin subtypes mediate compartmentalization, although further studies are
needed to confirm this conclusion.
Lineage restriction of neuroepithelial cells in diencephalic
subdivisions has been elucidated in the chick embryo
[6,59]. The chick diencephalon is firstly subdivided into
three regions; the presumptive pretectum, dorsal thalamus, and ventral thalamus. Previous studies suggested
that differential expression of types I and II cadherins
demarcates diencephalic subdivisions in the chick and
mouse embryos [11,12,34,60]. In the present study, the
expression of cad7 overlapped with that of cad20 in the rat
neural plate in the forebrain region. Furthermore, a previous cell lineage analysis suggested that the midbrain/diencephalon boundary restricts cell mixing [61,62], and that
cad6 delineates the midbrain/diencephalon boundary in
the mouse neural plate [62]. In fact, the posterior border
of cad7 became clearer at E11.5 compared with at E10.5
and the sharp expression boundary was maintained at
E12.5 as in the case of Otx2 expression (Fig. 2E, I). Otx2
regulates the cell adhesion property of neuroepithelial
cells in mice [37], and overexpression of Otx can induce
cell aggregation in zebrafish embryos [63]. ZLI is not a cell
population derived from specialized cells at p2/3 boundary, but is itself a compartment that originates from the
area that does not express Lunatic fringe (L-fng) [64]. The
p2/3 border is demarcated by the expression of Six3 and
Irx3 in the early neural plate [40], where ZLI is established. However, in the early neural plate, whether the p2/
3 boundary restricts cell mixing has not been elucidated in
both avian and rodent embryos. Interestingly, we found
that the posterior border of cad20 expression was consistent with the p2/3 border, which is mediated by mutual
repression of Six3/Fez1/Fez like1 and Irx3/Irx1 (Fig. 3)
[40,65]. Our finding suggests the involvement of cad20
restricted expression in establishment of ZLI-signalling
centre formed at the p2/3 boundary.

Expression of cad7 and cad20 in the hindbrain progenitor
domains and rhombomere boundary
Although the hindbrain and spinal cord are subdivided
into the basal and alar plates at the sulcus limitans defined
by a morphological groove in the vertebrates, a recent
study using molecular markers has shown that the basal/
alar boundary corresponds to the dorsal border of cad7
expression in the chick neural tube [22]. Our study
showed that longitudinal expression of cad20 resembles
those of chick cad7 and Xenopus F-cad at the hindbrain
level (Fig. 4) [18,20] and that the sulcus limitans in the rat
hindbrain is somewhat related to the expression of cad20.
Remarkably, along the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis, cad20
mRNA expression was gradually downregulated in the
basal plate from r7 to the spinal cord, and restricted in V2
interneuron progenitor cells (Fig. 5). Moreover, the cad7expressing domain continued through the caudal hindbrain to the spinal cord (Figs. 2, 4 and 5), suggesting that
the basal/alar boundary could be established or maintained by distinct cadherin subtypes in the rostral hindbrain and spinal cord. It was noteworthy that both cad7
and cad20 were expressed at r6 in E11.5 along the D-V axis
(Fig. 4), and double staining for Dbx2/cad7 and Gsh1/
cad20 showed partial overlap of cad7 and cad20 expression at r6 level in the E11.5 hindbrain (Fig. 4). Since heterophilic adhesion has been reported within distinct type
II cadherins [17], and EC1, which is a critical sequence for
calcium-dependent adhesion, is highly conserved
between cad7 and cad20 proteins (Fig. 1), determination
of the adhesion properties of cad7 and cad20 proteins
should be the next research priority.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/8/87

boundaries implicates differential cell adhesiveness
between boundary and non-boundary cells in maintenance of boundary cells. Considering the expression of
cad7 in ZLI, a boundary in the chick diencephalon [34],
our findings could be interpreted to mean that cadherinmediated cell-to-cell contact serves to restrict intermingling of boundary cells and compartment cells, thereby
maintaining boundary regions.

In the ventral spinal cord and hindbrain, transcription factors such as Pax, Nkx and Dbx families regulate the formation of progenitor domains by HD codes and specification
of neuronal subtypes by mutual repression activities
[7,43]. In the chick spinal cord, ectopically expressed Pax7
can repress cad7 in the ventral region and Shh can induce
cad7 in the dorsal region [66]. Therefore, it is possible that
rat cad7 and cad20 are regulated by Shh signalling pathway.

Expression of cad7 in precerebellar neurons and
cerebellum during late embryonic and adult periods
Interestingly, the expression of cad7 and cad20 mRNAs in
the neuroepithelium disappeared by E14.5, and their
expression was detected in postmitotic neurons in the
pons and medulla oblongata (Figs. 6 and 7). Previous
studies reported that cadherins also contribute to cell
migration in the brain [48]. In the cerebellum, Purkinje
cells are generated from epithelial progenitor cells and
migrate to the deep layer [71]. Experimentally, cad7 and
cad6b-overexpressed progenitor cells preferentially
migrated into Purkinje cell domain, which endogenously
expresses these cadherins in the chick cerebellum [72].
The lower RL cells generate four types of precerebellar
neurons to form the pontine, reticulotegmental, lateral
reticular and external cuneate nuclei [73,74]. These
precerebellar neurons project to the granule cells in the
cerebellum [71]. The dorsal cells of the caudal hindbrain
generate the inferior olive neurons, and express cadherin
subtypes, e.g., cad6, cad8 and cad11 [23,24]. Interestingly,
at later stages, we observed switching of cad7 expression
from epithelial cells to migrating postmitotic neurons.
Although the expression of various cadherin subtypes in
precerebellar neurons had been reported previously [48],
the expression of cad7 was more specifically detected than
that of other cadherins in all precerebellar nuclei. Neurons expressing cad7 (X/XII cranial motor neurons, pontine and external cuneate neurons) aggregated at late
embryonic stages (Figs. 6 and 7), suggesting the involvement of cad7 in cell sorting mechanisms, in agreement
with the functions of type II classic cadherin subtypes in
the chick spinal cord [31].

A previous study indicated that segregation of boundary
cells is mediated by radical fringe-mediated activation of
the Notch signalling pathway in the zebrafish hindbrain
[67]. In the mouse, although three fringe genes are not
expressed at rhombomere boundaries [68], expression of
Hes1, a target gene of Notch signalling, persists at high
levels in boundary cells in the hindbrain [69]. Rhombomere boundary cells exhibit a static feature contrary to
rhombomere centre cells, i.e., a slow rate of proliferation
and interkinetic nuclear migration, and their nuclei are
located on the ventricular surface [70]. Since cad7 expression in rhombomere boundaries actually starts after the
formation of boundaries, such expression at rhombomere

We found sparse cad7 expression in precerebellar neurons
in the adult hindbrain (Fig. 8). The cadherin-catenin complex including N-cadherin/αN-catenin is involved in the
formation of synaptic contact [26,75]. Furthermore,
recent studies have shown that type II subtypes, cad11 and
cad13, also have specific roles in synaptic function including modulation of long-term potential and neurotransmission [76,77], and that cad8 has an important role in
transmission of sensory information from sensory neurons to the dorsal horn neurons in the spinal cord [78].
Therefore, the expression pattern of cad7 in the hindbrain
and cerebellum suggests that cad7 may physiologically
modulate the cerebellar/precerebellar neural circuitry.

Genomic organization of cad20/cad19/cad7 cluster and
expression among different species
Cadherin family genes evolutionally duplicated [79] and
formed as several clusters on chromosomes [80,81]. In the
human genome, CDH5 (VE-cad)/CDH1 (E-cad)/CDH3
(P-cad) and CDH8/CDH11/CDH13/CDH15 are located
on chromosome 16q21/22 [80], and CDH20/CDH19/
CDH7 are clustered on 18q22-23 [30]. Comparison of the
expression of such clustered cadherin genes among distinct species is important in order to identify common
control element. However, our results showed that the
distribution of rat cad7 and cad19 to that of cad20 was
inconsistent with the localization of their homologues in
the chick (Fig. 1, Table 1). Chick cad7 is also expressed in
neural crest-derived cells as well as in the ventral neural
tube [20,21]. Our previous and present studies showed
that cad19 but not cad7 was expressed in the neural crest
cell lineage at the trunk level in the rat [27], suggesting
that the distribution of cad7 and cad19 genes is associated
with their expression patterns. However, the expression of
chick cad19 was detected in part of neural crest-derived
cells and neural tube but not in the dorsal domain and
rhombomere boundary cells in the hindbrain (our
unpublished observation). Taken together, our analysis
suggests that the expression patterns of clustered cad20/
cad19/cad7 genes are regulated by species-specific gene
regulatory elements in avian and rodent embryos, which
is in contrast to the highly conserved expression patterns
of HD protein genes in the central nervous system.

Conclusion
The present study demonstrated that cell populations that
express cad7 and cad20 are diversified in the rat and chick.
The expression of these cadherin subtypes demarcates
compartments, boundaries, progenitor domains, specific
nuclei and circuits during mammalian hindbrain development.

Methods

National Institute of Health guidelines for care and use of
laboratory animals. The Committee for Animal Experiments of Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine
approved the experimental procedures described in this
study. The midday of the vaginal plug was designated as
embryonic day 0.5 (E0.5). Pregnant Sprague-Dawley (SD)
rats were purchased from Charles River Japan. Pax6
homozygous mutant rat embryos were obtained by crossing of male and female Small eye rat heterozygotes (rSey2/

base at UCSC Genome Bioinformatics. cDNA fragments
encoding ORF of rat cad7 and cad20 were amplified by RTPCR using oligonucleotide primers designed based on the
identified rat genomic sequences. Total RNA taken from
the head including the hindbrain of E12.5 rat embryos
was purified with RNeasy column (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and cDNA was synthesized using oligo dT primer
and reverse transcriptase (Superscript II, Invitrogen, San
Diego, CA). The primer sets were as follow: 5' fragment of
cad7 (1–1467: 5'-ATGAAGCTGGGCAAAGTGGAG-3' and

bar was set to represent 10% differences.
Cloning of rat cDNAs encoding transcription factors
To obtain rat Gsh1, Krox20 and Gbx2 cDNAs, the corresponding genomic sequence was amplified by genomic
PCR using oligonucleotide primers. Rat Dbx2 and Lbx1
cDNAs were amplified by RT-PCR using mRNA prepared
from E12.5 SD rat embryos. Primer sets were designed
based on the sequences, which are homologous to mouse

numbers are AB197922 (rat Gsh1), AB264614 (rat
Krox20), AB266843 (rat Gbx2), AB121147 (rat Dbx2) and
AB197923 (rat Lbx1).
Whole-mount in situ hybridization
Whole-mount in situ hybridization was performed as
described previously [27,52]. Dissected embryos were
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA)/phosphate buffered
saline (PBS) overnight at 4°C. Digoxigenin (DIG)labelled riboprobes were synthesized by in vitro transcription with DIG RNA labelling mix (Roche, Mannheim,
Germany) and T3 or T7 RNA polymerase (Promega). All
synthesized probes were purified with Quick Spin Columns G-25 (RNA) (Roche) to remove unincorporated
nucleotides. For detection of cad7 mRNA, three kinds of
probes transcribed from different cad7 cDNA fragments
(1–460, 567–1460 and 1992–2361) were used in hybridization. To detect cad20 mRNA, four kinds of probes transcribed from different cad20 cDNA fragments (1–546,
1051–1497, 1639–1956 and 2014–2403) were mixed in
hybridization. Two-colour whole-mount in situ hybridization was performed using the protocol described on the
internet
http://www.anat.ucl.ac.uk/research/sternlab/
INSITU.htm. For double colour detection, fluoresceinlabelled riboprobes for Dbx2, Gsh1, Otx2 and Gbx2 were
generated with fluorescein RNA labelling mix (Roche),
and simultaneously hybridized with DIG-labelled cad7 or
cad20 riboprobes, respectively. After the first colour reaction with alkaline phosphatase (AP)-conjugated anti-DIG
antibody (1:5000, Roche) and NBT/BCIP (Wako Pure
Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan), embryos were fixed
in 4% PFA/PBS at room temperature overnight and incubated in TBST containing 0.1% Tween20 at 65°C for 1
hour to inactivate AP completely. The second colour signal was detected with AP-conjugated anti-fluorescein antibody (1:5000, Roche) and INT/BCIP (Roche). Drs. I.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/8/87

Matsuo, A. Mansouri and P. Gruss kindly provided mouse
Otx2, Six3 and Irx3 cDNAs for synthesis of riboprobes,
respectively. Images were recorded by cooled colour CCD
camera (Penguin 600CL, Pixera, San Jose, CA).
In situ hybridization
In situ hybridization using frozen sections of embryonic
tissues was performed as described previously [43]. E12.5
whole rat embryos and heads of E14.5 and E18.5 embryos
were fixed in 4% PFA/PBS overnight at °C. For fixation of
E20.5 rat foetuses, the brains were dissected and fixed
without the pia mater in 4% PFA/PBS overnight. Embryos
and foetuses were embedded with optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound (Sakura, Tokyo) and cut into
12 μm sections with a cryostat (Leica, Nussloch, Germany). DIG-labelled riboprobes were synthesized with T3
or T7 (Promega) or SP6 (Takara Shuzo, Ohtsu, Japan)
RNA polymerase and hybridized to sections. To detect the
expression of cad7 mRNA, two kinds of riboprobes of cad7
were generated from different cDNA fragments (1–1467
and 1447–2361), and mixed in hybridization. Riboprobes of cad20 were synthesized by from two cDNA fragments (1–1071 and 1051–2450), and used
simultaneously in hybridization. Mouse Gata2, rat cad6/
K-cad [82] and rat Sox10 cDNAs were kindly provided by
Drs. M. Yamamoto, M. Tanaka and M. Wegner, respectively. For in situ hybridization of the adult brain, 8-weekold male adult rats (postnatal day 60) were deeply anesthetized and decapitated. Brains were immediately dissected out and frozen on powder dry ice. The brains were
cut into 14 μm sections, and were post-fixed in 4% PFA/
PBS for 15 minutes at room temperature. Sections were
acetylated with tri-ethanoamine, HCl and acetic acid for
10 min. The following strategies of hybridization and
staining were performed according to the protocol
described for embryonic tissues except for changing the
concentration of AP-conjugated anti-DIG antibody
(1:2000). Images were recorded with colour CCD camera
(HC-25000 3CCD, Fuji, Tokyo).
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry using frozen sections was performed as described previously [52]. Embryos and foetuses were fixed as described above for in situ
hybridization. Antigen-enhanced sections, which were
boiled in 0.1 M citric acid solution in a microwave, were
incubated with anti-Pax6 rabbit polyclonal antibody [62]
(1:500) and anti-Islet1/2 mouse monoclonal antibody
(D.S.H.B, 40.2D6, 1:100), which were diluted with 2%
goat serum/TBST overnight at 4°C. As secondary antibodies, biotin-conjugated affinity purified anti-rabbit IgG
(dilution, 1:200, Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories,
West Grove, PA) and anti-mouse IgG donkey antibodies
(1:200, Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA)
were used. Signal was enhanced by combination of ABC

kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and enhanced
DAB kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). After in situ hybridization
for Sox10 and cad7, sections were incubated with antineuron-specific class III β-tubulin antibody (1:2000, Tuj1,
MMS-435P, Covance, Madison, WI), and the signal was
detected by using Cy3-conjugated affinity purified antimouse IgG donkey antibody (1:400, Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories). Images were recorded with AxioPlanII and AxioCamMRm (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany).
BrdU labelling using whole embryo cultures
Short pulse labelling of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU, Sigma
Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) for cultured rat embryos was
performed as described previously [43]. E12.5 rat
embryos were precultured for 1 hour and BrdU solution
was directly added to the culture medium. Embryos were
exposed to BrdU for 20 min and fixed in 4% PFA/PBS.
After detection of Gata2 mRNA by in situ hybridization,
sections were treated with 2N HCl solution for 15 min at
37°C and neutralized in TBST. Sections were incubated
with anti-BrdU mouse monoclonal antibody (BectonDickinson, Mountain View, CA, 1:50), and the signal was
detected with ABC kit and enhanced DAB kit.
