Abstract
Background: The fungus-growing ant-microbe symbiosis consists of coevolving microbial
mutualists and pathogens. The diverse fungal lineages that these ants cultivate are attacked by
parasitic microfungi of the genus Escovopsis. Previous molecular analyses have demonstrated strong
phylogenetic congruence between the ants, the ants-cultivated fungi and the garden pathogen
Escovopsis at ancient phylogenetic levels, suggesting coevolution of these symbionts. However, few
studies have explored cophylogenetic patterns between these symbionts at the recent phylogenetic
levels necessary to address whether these parasites are occasionally switching to novel hosts or
whether they are diversifying with their hosts as a consequence of long-term host fidelity.
Results: Here, a more extensive phylogenetic analysis of Escovopsis lineages infecting the gardens
of Apterostigma ants demonstrates that these pathogens display patterns of phylogenetic
congruence with their fungal hosts. Particular clades of Escovopsis track particular clades of
cultivated fungi, and closely-related Escovopsis generally infect closely-related hosts. Discordance
between host and parasite phylogenies, however, provides the first evidence for occasional hostswitches or acquisitions of novel infections from the environment.
Conclusion: The fungus-growing ant-microbe association has a complex coevolutionary history.
Though there is clear evidence of host-specificity on the part of diverse Escovopsis lineages, these
pathogens have switched occasionally to novel host fungi. Such switching is likely to have profound
effects on how these host and parasites adapt to one another over evolutionary time scales and
may impact how disease spreads over ecological time scales.

Background
Most parasites are intimately dependent on one or a few
hosts. Because of this host fidelity, parasites are expected
to track speciating hosts by speciating themselves. This
process, known as cospeciation, will lead to cocladogenesis, the topological matching of symbiont phylogenies.

Parasite and host phylogenies are rarely identical, however; forces such as duplication (parasite speciation in the
absence of host speciation), sorting events (host speciation without commensurate parasite speciation), and
host-switching (parasites begin to use a new host) [1,2]
can generate discordance between the phylogenies of

hosts and their symbionts. Despite these complications,
congruent phylogenies are known in host-parasite associations [3-5] and in host-mutualist associations as well [68].
The fungus-growing ant-microbe symbiosis is a novel
example of a system in which cocladogenesis occurs
between a host and both its mutualistic and parasitic symbionts. Research over the last decade has demonstrated
the congruence of the phylogenies of fungus-growing
ants, the fungi that they cultivate (i.e., their fungal cultivars) and the cultivar-attacking pathogen Escovopsis at
ancient phylogenetic levels [9-11]. Genetic analyses of
more recently diverged, younger lineages demonstrate discrepancies between ant and cultivar associations, which
are likely due to a combination of lateral transfer of cultivars between colonies and occasional domestication of
free-living fungi by the ants [12-15]. To date, the two published phylogenetic studies of the Escovopsis-cultivar association indicate no discordance between the phylogenies
of the cultivars and Escovopsis [10,16].
Ancient codiversification of fungus-growing ants and their
cultivars is driven by the intimate dependence of the ants
on fungus as their primary food source and the intimate
dependence of the fungus on ants for protection, nutrition and dispersal [17]. In ants, the ability to cultivate
fungi for food arose only once, about 50–60 million years
ago, and gave rise to roughly 200 described, extant species
of fungus-growing ants (Tribe Attini)[18]. The long coevolutionary history of these mutualists has led to the specialization of each ant species on the cultivation of a
unique, narrow range of cultivated fungi, most of which
are in the family Lepiotaceae. As depicted in Figure 1A,
these lepiotaceous cultivars form two morphologically
and molecularly distinct groups ('G1' and 'G3'; [9]). There
has been one switch to a distantly related cultivar; most
ants in the genus Apterostigma now cultivate fungi in the
family Pterulaceae [19], which is distantly related to the
family Lepiotaceae. The pterulaceous cultivars fall into
two monophyletic, morphologically distinct cultivar
groups ('G2' and 'G4' in Figure 1A; [11]). One Apterostigma species, A. auriculatum, has retained the ancestral
state of growing lepiotaceaous cultivars [11].
Currie et al. [10] demonstrated that, at ancient levels, the
phylogeny of Escovopsis (Ascomycota: Hypocreales) (Figure 1B), a genus of specialized, highly pathogenic microfungi that attack the ants' fungal cultivars, matches that of
the ants' diverse cultivars and consequently that of the
ants themselves. Escovopsis has only been found associated
with nests of attine ants. Upon establishing infection,
Escovopsis consumes the ants' cultivated fungi and can devastate attine colonies [20-22]. Though infection rates vary
across host species, infections are prevalent in colonies of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/88

many attine genera throughout their geographic ranges
[16,20,21]. Escovopsis is thought to track the cultivars
because of the coevolutionary specialization of each Escovopsis lineage on attacking and overcoming defenses of
only a narrow range of cultivar hosts [16,23].
Ancient phylogenetic congruence between cultivars and
Escovopsis suggests that these pathogens may be tightly
tracking their speciating hosts by speciating themselves,
and that Escovopsis lineages have not switched to novel
cultivar hosts over evolutionary time. To test for hostswitching, however, it is necessary to include extensive
sampling across the diversity of both hosts and symbionts. Previous studies of Escovopsis host-fidelity have
included few samples of Apterostigma-associated Escovopsis
despite the fact that they are an extremely diverse group of
fungus-growing ant pathogens. Currie et al. [10], the most
extensive phylogenetic analysis of Escovopsis to date,
included only two Apterostigma-associated Escovopsis,
which were morphologically similar and were isolated
from ant colonies that raised closely-related fungi. Not
surprisingly, these isolates formed a single monophyletic
"Apterostigma Escovopsis" clade (Figure 1B). However,
unlike the other fungus-growing ant genera, which each
raise cultivars in a single cultivar group, Apterostigma ants
raise cultivars in three groups (G2, G3 and G4 in Figure
1A), which are each attacked by morphologically distinct
Escovopsis types[23]. More extensive sampling of these
diverse Apterostigma pathogens, therefore, can reveal the
extent to which Escovopsis species are host-faithful, tracking their particular hosts without host-switching.
Through extensive geographic sampling and phylogenetic
analysis of Apterostigma-associated Escovopsis, we ask
whether host and pathogen phylogenies are still congruent when genetic analyses are extended to include the
diversity of the Apterostigma-associated Escovopsis. First, do
Apterostigma-associated Escovopsis form a monophyletic
clade as the Apterostigma ants do, or are Apterostigma-associated Escovopsis polyphyletic like their cultivars? Second,
do the Apterostigma Escovopsis form three distinct clades
that correspond to the three cultivar groups (G2, G3 and
G4) raised by the different species of Apterostigma ants?
Based on earlier findings that Escovopsis is highly cultivartype specific [16], we hypothesize that more extensive
sampling will reveal that the Apterostigma-associated
Escovopsis are not monophyletic like their associated anthosts, because the Escovopsis that infects lepiotaceous
Apterostigma cultivars (i.e. the cultivars raised by A. auriculatum) will be more closely-related to Escovopsis isolated
from lepiotaceous gardens of non-Apterostigma ant species
than to Escovopsis isolated from pterulaceous Apterostigma
gardens (Figure 1C). This would support findings of Currie et al. [10], depicted in Figure 1B, that the pterulaceousattacking Escovopsis form a monophyletic clade distinct

Current symbiont phylogenies and hypothesized Escovopsis relationships. (a) Cultivar phylogeny simplified from [911] (b) Escovopsis phylogeny from [10]. This phylogenetic reconstruction, the most complete to date, includes very few Apterostigma-associated pathogens.

from the Escovopsis that infects lepiotaceous cultivars, but
would contradict their findings of complete congruence
between ant, cultivar, and Escovopsis phylogenies. We further hypothesize that more extensive sampling will reveal
that pterulaceous-attacking Escovopsis will fall into two
clades associated with the two pterulaceous cultivar
groups (G2 and G4). Overall, in looking at the fungusgrowing ant-microbe symbiosis as a whole, we predict
four host-specific Escovopsis clades that are each specialized at attacking one of the four known fungus-growing
ant cultivar groups (G1, G2, G3 and G4) (Figure 1C).

Results
Diversity of Apterostigma-associated Escovopsis
Of 623 colonies from which microbes were sampled, at
least one fungal symbiont (either cultivar or Escovopsis)
was isolated from each of 410 colonies. For the purpose of
this study, based on field identification of the ants, garden
architecture and growth form of cultivar isolates, each col-

ony was classified as either a G2, G3 or G4 colony, which
raise respectively G2, G3 and G4 cultivars (see introduction).
Escovopsis infection of these 410 colonies was common
and pathogen phenotypes were diverse. G2 colonies and
G4 colonies had much higher infection rates than G3 colonies (G-test with Yate's Correction: G2 vs. G3, G = 36.0,
df = 1, p < 0.0001; G4 vs. G3, G = 6.3, df = 1, p < 0.0001;
G2 vs G4, G = 0.1, df = 1, p = 0.8). More than 50% of G2
and G4 colonies were infected with at least one Escovopsis
type, whereas only 11% of G3 colonies were infected
(Table 1). Escovopsis samples isolated from infected colonies were classified into four morphotypes based on
spore-color: brown, yellow, white and pink. These types
have different micromorphological conidiophore structures (Currie, unpublished) and likely represent different
Escovopsis lineages. In the absence of proper species
descriptions, we will refer to the different Escovopsis line-

ages by their characteristic spore-color (white, pink, yellow, brown). While white and pink Escovopsis were each
specific to a single cultivar group, brown Escovopsis
infected both G2 cultivars and G4 cultivars, and yellow
Escovopsis infected both G2 cultivars and G3 cultivars. The
yellow Escovopsis isolates associated with these two clades,
however, are micromorphologically distinct from one
another (Currie, unpublished) and likely are two separate
species. A small percentage of colonies (10% of G2 colonies) were infected by multiple Escovopsis morphotypes
(Table 1).
Phylogenetic relationships of Apterostigma-associated
Escovopsis
The results of parsimony, likelihood and Bayesian analyses were highly concordant. Three well supported clades
were identified that correspond to brown, white and pink
Escovopsis (Figure 2). Yellow Escovopsis is not monophyletic; G2-attacking yellow Escovopsis is genetically distinct from the single isolate of G3-attacking yellow
Escovopsis. Overall, as predicted, these diverse Apterostigma-associated Escovopsis do not form a monophyletic
clade. Both the yellow and pink Escovopsis isolated from
Apterostigma colonies with G3 cultivars are nested within
other G3-attacking Escovopsis and are distinct from other
Apterostigma-associated Escovopsis. Contradictory to our
predictions, G2-attacking and G4-attacking Escovopsis do
not form separate, monophyletic clades. Within the
brown Escovopsis, there are two clades of G4-associated
Escovopsis.
Parametric-bootstrapping
verified
the
polyphyly of isolates of G4-associated Escovopsis. The null
hypothesis of a single origin of G4-associated Escovopsis
was rejected at p < 0.001. This implies that brown Escovopsis has switched multiple times between G2 and G4 hosts.

Discussion
Phylogenetic patterns of the fungus-growing ant microbe
symbiosis reveal a coevolutionary history of host-fidelity
punctuated by occasional host-shifts. All known Escovopsis
lineages have some limitation to their host-range. For
example, we here show that pink Escovopsis attacks only
lepiotaceous G3 cultivars (including A. auriculatum's cultivars), white Escovopsis attacks only G2 cultivars, and
though Escovopsis with yellow spores attacks both G2 and
G3 cultivars, the yellow Escovopsis lineages associated with
each of these host groups are morphologically and genetically distinct (Figure 2). Despite this specificity, however,
there is not complete congruence of host and pathogen
phylogenies as suggested by previous studies [10], indicating that Escovopsis host ranges have shifted and may continue to shift (Figure 3). This complex history parallels
that of other symbiotic associations in which extensive
sampling reveals that codiversification is interrupted
often by host-switches [13,24-26]. In fact, it appears that
the cases where cocladogenesis persists over evolutionary

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/88

time are mostly vertically-transmitted endosymbionts
[27-30], whereas most ectosymbionts, such as Escovopsis
and the fungal cultivar, show patterns of switching and
absence of strict cocladogenesis with their hosts.
Adaptive processes may explain the host-fidelity of most
Escovopsis types, which leads to the host-specific Escovopsis
clades revealed here. Gerardo et al. [23] demonstrated
through microbial bioassays that Escovopsis lineages are
attracted to chemical signals released by their host cultivars. For example, in microbial bioassays, isolates of yellow Escovopsis from G2-Apterostigma colonies grow more
rapidly towards chemical signals produced by G2 than by
G4 and G3 cultivars, which is consistent with the hostrange of yellow Escovopsis. Unlike yellow Escovopsis, brown
Escovopsis from G2-Apterostigma colonies is equally
attracted to G2 and G4 cultivars. It is possible that this
host-attraction would make it easier for brown Escovopsis
to switch between G2 and G4 hosts than it would be for
yellow Escovopsis to switch between hosts, because brown
Escovopsis would be equally likely to move through G2
and G4 fungal gardens, find healthy cultivar and establish
infection. This is consistent with the phylogenetic results
here, where is seems that brown Escovopsis has switched
between G2 and G4 hosts.
Microbial bioassays have also revealed that cultivars can
defend themselves against some Escovopsis but not others
[23]. G3-Apterostigma cultivars can inhibit isolates of both
brown Escovopsis and G2-associated yellow Escovopsis but
cannot inhibit isolates of pink Escovopsis, possibly explaining why brown and G2-associated yellow Escovopsis do not
attack G3 cultivars in nature, while pink Escovopsis does.
Brown and yellow Escovopsis are not, however, inhibited
by most isolates of G2 and G4 cultivars, explaining why
natural infection is possible in these host-parasite combinations. Overall, both cultivar defense against Escovopsis
and Escovopsis' attraction to host cultivars may maintain
Escovopsis' specialization and prevent rampant hostswitching.
Because Escovopsis species are host-specific, we hypothesized that wider sampling of Escovopsis would reveal four
Escovopsis clades that correspond to four cultivar and ant
clades (Figure 1). However, contradictory to our hypothesis (Figure 1c), G4-associated Escovopsis are not monophyletic (Figure 3b). Furthermore, there is a lack of
congruence of cultivar and Escovopsis phylogenies at
deeper nodes (Figure 3). Whereas previous analyses [911] have indicated that Apterostigma ants, their pterulaceous cultivars and their associated Escovopsis are distantly-related to the highly-derived leafcutter ants and
their associated microbes (including G1 cultivars), some
Apterostigma-associated Escovopsis lineages, namely brown
Escovopsis, are sister to the Escovopsis attacking G1 cultivars

Escovopsis types are identified here according to spore-color. 1 For the G2-cultivar colonies, the number of infections based on spore-color exceeds
the number of total infections because many colonies were infected with two or three Escovopsis types. 2 Though sharing a similar spore-color, the
G2-attacking and G3-attacking yellow Escovopsis have distinct micromorphologies (Currie, unpublished).

(fig 3b). This suggests that an Escovopsis lineage switched
between these two distantly-related, ecologically-distinct
fungal hosts (i.e. Apterostigma colonies and leafcutter colonies).

Methods

Discordance of host and pathogen phylogenies suggests
that Escovopsis lineages have switched hosts over the evolutionary history of their host association, but the available evidence does not allow inference regarding the
frequency at which switching occurs. It is also unclear
whether switching involves the acquisition of novel Escovopsis strains by the ants from their environment, or
whether it involves the direct transmission of Escovopsis
between colonies by some unknown mechanism. Further
research on the exact mechanism of Escovopsis transmission would be helpful in revealing the likelihood of pathogen exchange between colonies containing distantlyrelated cultivars.

Collections and infection prevalence
From 2001–2004, we sampled 632 Apterostigma colonies
collected across their geographic range in order to isolate
fungal symbionts (cultivar and Escovopsis). All fungi were
cultured following procedures of [16]. Escovopsis samples
from Panama, Costa Rica, and Argentina were maintained
as live cultures on potato dextrose agar with 50 mg/L each
of penicillin and streptomycin until spores and mycelium
could be directly frozen at -80 degrees. Fungal samples
from Ecuador were only temporally maintained live after
collection and were then stored in 95% alcohol prior to
export from the country. DNA extraction of frozen samples followed a CTAB extraction protocol modified from
[31].

Conclusion
Phylogenetic analyses coupled with extensive sampling of
host and parasites reveal a more complete picture of the
complexity of the Escovopsis-cultivar association in colonies of fungus-growing ants, which consists of specialized
pathogen species that occasionally switch between distantly-related hosts. Clades of closely-related Escovopsis
attack specific cultivar groups, causing the matching of
cultivar and Escovopsis phylogenies at some scales. Discordance of host-parasite phylogenies, however, arises
due to host-switching (Figure 3). These results reveal the
need for additional sampling across the fungus-growing
ant microbial symbiosis as a whole. To date, there has not
been extensive sampling and analysis of the pathogens
that attack the diverse G3 cultivars grown by many fungus-growing ant species [13]. There are also few published
genetic analyses of the cultivars of the leafcutter ants, agricultural pests in much of the Neotropics, and the leafcutter-associated Escovopsis. Broad sampling and genetic
analyses across the symbiosis will give insight into how

labile these associations are over both ecological and evolutionary time.

Infection prevalence in the three colony-types (G2, G3
and G4) was determined by dividing the number of colonies infected with Escovopsis by the total number of colonies from which either Escovopsis or cultivar was
successfully isolated (colonies from which no microbes
were isolated were excluded from these analyses). We
then used log-likelihood ratio tests (a.k.a. G-tests) to compare rates of infection across colony-types. These tests
were performed in R (ver 2.3.1, [32]) using the function
g.test.r [33] with the William's correction applied.
Samples for phylogenetic reconstruction
To determine the relationship amongst Escovopsis strains
isolated from Apterostigma spp. colonies, samples for phylogenetic reconstruction were selected to include all Escovopsis morphotypes isolated from Apterostigma spp.
colonies. Because colonies with G2 cultivars are commonly found and are frequently infected with Escovopsis,
we sequenced more Escovopsis strains from G2 (n = 44)
than from G3 (n = 5) or G4 (n = 4) colonies. We also

Comparison of cultivar and Escovopsis phylogenies
Figure 3
Comparison of cultivar and Escovopsis phylogenies. (a) Cultivar phylogeny as in Figure 1A. (b) Escovopsis phylogeny synthesized from Figure 2. * indicates fungal symbionts from Apterostigma colonies. Clades of Escovopsis corresponding to cultivar
clades suggests coevolutionary specialization of the pathogen, but discordance of the host and pathogen phylogenies as a whole
suggests occasional host-switching by Escovopsis during the evolutionary history of the association.

sequenced one yellow-spored Escovopsis sample isolated
from a Cyphomyrmex longiscapus colony for comparison
with other yellow Escovopsis included this study. Sequencing targeted a 987 nucleotide stretch spanning 1 exon of
nuclear elongation factor-1 alpha (EF-1 α) using PCR
primers EF1-983F and EF1-2218 as well additional internal sequencing primers EF1-6mf and EF1-6mr [16]. All
sequences
are
deposited
in
Genbank
[GenBank:DQ848156 – DQ848209].
In the final alignment, we included five previously
sequenced Apterostigma-associated Escovopsis [GenGenBank:AY172619,
GenBank:AY172618,
Bank:AY629395–AY629397] as well as sequences of

Sequences were assembled in SeqMan II (ver 5.05, DNASTAR), aligned using Clustal W WWW [34]and edited manually in MacClade (ver 4.06, [35]).
Phylogenetic analyses and hypothesis testing
Parsimony analyses were performed in PAUP* (ver
4.0b10, [36]) using heuristic searches with TBR branch
swapping and 10,000 random addition sequence replicates (multrees = yes). In order to obtain estimates of
clade support, non-parametric bootstrapping was performed with heuristic searches of 5000 replicate datasets
and 10 random addition sequence replicates per dataset
(multrees = no).

For maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses, a model
of sequence evolution was estimated for the data set using
MODELTEST ver. 3.7 [37]. The chosen model, K81uf +
pinvar + Γ, was used for all maximum likelihood analyses
and parametric hypothesis testing. Because it is not possible to implement this model in Mr. Bayes, a more complex model of sequence evolution, GTR + pinvar + Γ, was
used in all Bayesian analyses.
For maximum likelihood analysis, we performed a successive approximation search using PAUP* to estimate the
topology [38]. Starting parameter values estimated from a
parsimony tree (TBR branch swapping, 100 random addition sequence replicates, multrees = no) were used in an
initial maximum-likelihood search. Parameters were then
re-estimated from the resulting tree and the search was
repeated with these new parameters. This procedure was
repeated until the resulting tree was identical in topology
to that from the previous iteration. Non-parametric bootstrapping was performed with heuristic searches of 1000
replicate datasets starting from a neighbor-joining tree
(multrees = yes).
For Bayesian analyses, using Mr. Bayes (ver 3.0b4, [39]),
four separate Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) runs
were performed starting from random trees for each of
four simultaneous chains. Runs were five million generations with a burn-in of 100,000 generations, default prior
distribution for model parameters, and the differential
heating parameter set to 0.2. The joint posterior probabilities and parameter estimates of each run were congruent,
suggesting the chains were run for a sufficient number of
generations to adequately sample the posterior probability landscape.
Phylogenetic analysis with no topological constraints
indicated two origins of G4-associated Escovopsis (Figure
2). To test the hypothesis of monophyly of Escovopsis isolated from G4 colonies, we compared the observed, optimal tree (alternative hypothesis) to trees constrained to
represent the null hypothesis of a single origin of G4

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/88

Escovopsis. Sequence evolution parameters were estimated
by using maximum likelihood under the K81uf + pinvar +
Γ. We used parametric bootstrapping procedures to evaluate 500 simulated datasets generated using Seq-Gen (ver
1.2.5, [40]).
