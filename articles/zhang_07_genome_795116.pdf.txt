Abstract
Background: Genetic analysis of Escherichia coli O157:H7 strains has shown divergence into two
distinct lineages, lineages I and II, that appear to have distinct ecological characteristics, with lineage
I strains more commonly associated with human disease. In this study, microarray-based
comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was used to identify genomic differences among 31 E.
coli O157:H7 strains that belong to various phage types (PTs) and different lineage-specific
polymorphism assay (LSPA) types.
Results: A total of 4,084 out of 6,057 ORFs were detected in all E. coli O157:H7 strains and 1,751
were variably present or absent. Based on this data, E. coli O157:H7 strains were divided into three
distinct clusters, which consisted of 15 lineage I (LSPA type 111111), four lineage I/II (designated in
this study) (LSPA type 211111) and 12 lineage II strains (LSPA 222222, 222211, 222212, and
222221), respectively. Eleven different genomic regions that were dominant in lineage I strains
(present in ≥80% of lineage I and absent from ≥ 92% of lineage II strains) spanned segments
containing as few as two and up to 25 ORFs each. These regions were identified within E. coli Sakai
S-loops # 14, 16, 69, 72, 78, 83, 85, 153 and 286, Sakai phage 10 (S-loops # 91, 92 and 93) and a
genomic backbone region. All four lineage I/II strains were of PT 2 and possessed eight of these 11
lineage I-dominant loci. Several differences in virulence-associated loci were noted between lineage
I and lineage II strains, including divergence within S-loop 69, which encodes Shiga toxin 2, and
absence of the non-LEE encoded effector genes nleF and nleH1-2 and the perC homologue gene
pchD in lineage II strains.
Conclusion: CGH data suggest the existence of two dominant lineages as well as LSPA type and
PT-related subgroups within E. coli O157:H7. The genomic composition of these subgroups
supports the phylogeny that has been inferred from other methods and further suggests that
genomic divergence from an ancestral form and lateral gene transfer have contributed to their
evolution. The genomic features identified in this study may contribute to apparent differences in
the epidemiology and ecology of strains of different E. coli O157:H7 lineages.

Background
Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) are associated with gastrointestinal and systemic illness in humans. This illness
can range in severity from uncomplicated diarrhea to
hemorrhagic colitis and the sometimes fatal hemolytic
uremic syndrome [1-3]. EHEC strains possess a number of
common virulence traits, such as the production of one or
more types of antigenically distinct Shiga toxins (Stx1 and
Stx2), a large plasmid that encodes an enterohemolysin,
and a chromosomal gene cluster termed the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) that is found in most, but not all
EHEC serotypes [4,5].
E. coli O157:H7 is the EHEC serotype most often associated with disease outbreaks and with the onset of severe
disease in the U.S., Canada, Japan, and the U.K. [2,3].
Genomic sequencing of two outbreak-related E. coli
O157:H7 strains, Sakai and EDL 933, revealed that there
are many phage-related sequences and genomic islands
scattered throughout the chromosome of this organism
and that many of these genetic elements encode potential
virulence attributes [6-9]. These E. coli O157:H7-specific
genomic segments are dispersed throughout 177 different
regions of a common genomic backbone that is shared
with the distantly related E. coli K-12. Known as S-loops
and O-islands (OI) in Sakai and EDL933 strains, respectively, some of the regions must be responsible for the virulence characteristics that were acquired during evolution
of E. coli O157:H7.
E. coli O157:H7 strains are believed to comprise a clonal
complex of related genotypes that are found worldwide
[10]. It has been suggested that E. coli O157:H7 arose
from the enteropathogenic E. coli serotype O55:H7
through sequential acquisition of virulence traits and
serotype change [11-13]. A step-wise evolution of E. coli
O157:H7 from enteropathogenic E. coli O55:H7 was
recently proposed, based on the properties of specific
existent strains that carry intermediate characteristics and
are presumed to represent intermediates in the evolution
of this EHEC serotype [11,13]. The proposed evolutionary
pathway includes lysogenization by an stx2-converting
phage followed by a shift in serotype from O55 to O157
brought about by acquisition of the O157 gnd-rfb locus
[14]. The EHEC large plasmid was then acquired by the
organism and the ability to ferment sorbitol was lost. The
sorbitol-non-fermenting O157:H7 ancestor was subsequently lysogenized with an stx1-converting phage and,
finally, acquired a frameshift mutation in the uidA gene,
resulting in loss of β-glucuronidase activity [11]. The
validity of this stepwise model is supported by recent
comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) studies using
E. coli O157:H7 whole genome-based oligonucleotide
microarrays [13].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/121

It is well recognized that E. coli O157:H7 populations
have a bovine reservoir and that the organism is likely
adapted for life in the ruminant gastrointestinal tract [1518]. Using Octamer-Based Genome Scanning (OBGS),
Kim et al., showed that Stx-producing, β-glucuronidase
and sorbitol-negative E. coli O157:H7 strains have
diverged into two distinct lineages, lineages I and II, and
that descendants of these two lineages appear to have distinct ecological characteristics [19,20]. Populations of the
two lineages are widespread in cattle in both the U.S. and
Australia, suggesting that these two lineages have been
disseminated throughout the global cattle population
[20]. Analysis of a set of nearly 1,500 E. coli O157:H7
strains showed that lineage I strains are more commonly
associated with human disease than lineage II strains, suggesting that there may be differences in virulence characteristics or transmissibility between these two taxonomic
groups of E. coli O157:H7 strains [21].
Although high resolution comparative studies have indicated that prophages are associated with divergence of E.
coli O157:H7 strains [6], systematic analysis of genetic distinctions between lineage I and lineage II strains has only
recently been undertaken. We [22] and others [23] have
recently reported that the Q anti-terminator gene found
upstream of the stx2 operon in E. coli O157:H7 differs
between lineage I and II strains. Possession of the stx2
gene is thought to be associated with the occurrence of
more severe disease, such as hemolytic uremic syndrome,
caused by EHEC strains [24]. In addition, Dowd and
Ishizaki [25] recently used oligonucleotide mini-arrays to
compare expression of a set of 610 genes between three
lineage I and three lineage II strains, noting differential
expression of stx2 as well as a number of other potentially
virulence-associated genes under anaerobic growth conditions. Collectively, these published studies suggest that
these lineages are genetically distinct and that lineage-specific genetic differences may be responsible for phenotypic differences between members of these two lineages.
To systematically identify lineage-specific genome segments, microarray-based CGH was used in this study to
catalogue genomic alterations that are unique to lineage I
or lineage II strains. The oligonucleotide microarray was
based on the genome sequences of two lineage I, human
outbreak-related E. coli O157:H7 strains, Sakai [9] and
EDL933 [7] and the nonpathogenic E. coli K12 (MG1655)
strain [26] and it was used to probe the genomes of a collection of E. coli O157:H7 strains. Although significant
strain-strain variation was observed, our focus was on
genome alterations that were conserved within different
strains of a given lineage. Regions of divergence identified
by CGH were then cloned and sequenced to gain additional insight into the genomic differences between the
two lineages. The results of the study show that many lin-

eage-specific differences in genomic content involve genes
that are known or potentially virulence-associated. These
findings may be used to identify candidate genes that
could confer lineage-specific traits related to unique ecological or virulence characteristics.

Results
Validation of microarray data by comparison with
sequence data
In the CGH experiments, 6,057 probes from the MWG E.
coli O157:H7 array set hybridized with a mixture of
labelled DNA from the three reference strains (K12, Sakai,
and EDL933) yielded adequate signals and these probes
were used for all subsequent analysis. For E. coli O157:H7
EDL933, 5221/5261 (99.2%) of the probes with 100 %
identity to the corresponding sequence gave the expected
results (Table 1). Among the 40 probes that were expected
to hybridize but did not with DNA from E. coli O157:H7
strain EDL933, 13 (0.25%) were negative and 27 (0.5%)
were uncertain according to the GACK analysis. While for
the E. coli O157:H7 Sakai strain only 4951/5335 (93%) of
the probes with 100 % identity to the corresponding
sequence gave the expected results. For strain Sakai, 39
(0.7%) were negative and 345 (6%) were uncertain based
on GACK analysis. However, twenty-one of the probes
with 100% identity to E. coli Sakai sequence that did not
generate a positive signal with E. coli Sakai DNA were
homologous to ORFs in S-loop#108 [9]. This S-loop is
equivalent to OI#57 in E. coli O157:H7 EDL933. PCR
experiments revealed that the Sakai strain used in this
study has a deletion of these ORFs in S-loop#108 while
the corresponding OI in EDL933 was intact (data not
shown).
Genomic variability in lineage I and lineage II E. coli
O157:H7 strains
In order to distinguish lineage-specific differences from
strain-strain variability, multiple strains belonging to
three different genotypic groups were tested. Our strain set
included fifteen different LSPA genotype 111111 strains
(lineage I), four different LSPA type 211111 strains (designated lineage I/II in this study) and 12 different lineage
II strains of LSPA types 222222, 222221, 222212, and
222211. Characteristics of the strains used in the study are
presented in Table 2, and data from microarray hybridization experiments with these E. coli O157:H7 strains are

presented in the supplemental material [see Additional
file 1]. A total of 4,084 of the 6,057 probes hybridized
with all E. coli O157:H7 strains tested, indicating that this
set of genes likely represents the conserved core genome
of the ancestral E. coli O157:H7 population that has been
maintained during its evolution. There were 222 probes
that hybridized only with DNA from E. coli K12 and not
with any of the E. coli O157:H7 strains tested, including
two probes (ECs1372 and b1894) that were expected to
hybridize with EDL933 and Sakai DNA, based on
sequence identity. The remaining 1751 probes showed
significant variability in microarray hybridization signals
among E. coli O157:H7 strains (Table 3), and the ORFs
that they represent were designated as variably absent or
present (VAP).
Of these 1,751 VAP, 79 hybridized with only one of the 31
E. coli O157:H7 strains tested and 662 hybridized with all
but one of the 31 E. coli O157:H7 strains tested. Initial
functional classification of the 1751 VAP genes showed
that 506 (29%) were encoded by prophage or phage-like
elements found in the K-12, EDL933 and Sakai genomes
and 615 (35%) were located within K-island (KI), Oisland (OI), or S-loop genomic islands [7,9,26]. The distribution of VAP genes in the genomes of E. coli EDL933
and Sakai and the percentage of the 31 E. coli O157:H7
strains that were divergent for each gene were plotted (Figures 1 and 2). In this study, "lineage-specific" refers to the
presence of single ORFs or ORF clusters exclusively in a
given lineage, while "lineage-dominant" refers to the presence of single ORFs or ORF clusters in ≥80% of the strains
of one lineage and their absence from ≥90% of strains of
other lineages.
Lineage- and phage type-specific and lineage and phage
type-dominant ORFs
A total of 132 of the 1,751 VAP ORFs were either specific
or dominant to a lineage, LSPA type or PT (Table 4, Figure
3).
i) S-loop#14/OI#7
Three lineage I and lineage I/II-specific ORFs, ECs0237,
ECs0238, and ECs0239, were identified in S-loop#14/
OI#7 by CGH (Table 4). The nucleotide sequence [GenBank:EF112439] of this region in the lineage II strain FRIK
920 was homologous to Sakai sequence, except that a

stretch of DNA extending from the 3' end of ECs0237 to
the 5' end of ECs0242 was missing. The missing ORFs
encode rearrangement hot spot (rhs) proteins and hypothetical proteins in E. coli Sakai.
ii) S-loop#16/OI#8
Eight E. coli S-loop#16/OI#8 ORFs were identified as
being lineage I and lineage I/II-specific by CGH (Table 4).
S-loop#16 corresponds to tandem prophages Sp1 and Sp2
in E. coli Sakai, and the majority of lineage I and lineage I/
II-specific ORFs in this region were homologous to
prophage genes. Repeated attempts to amplify the divergent region in S-loop#16 by long template PCR with FRIK
920 DNA were unsuccessful.
iii) S-loop#69/OI#45
S-loop#69/OI#45 corresponds to the stx2-converting bacteriophage Sp5, in E. coli Sakai. CGH revealed that this
region was not only highly divergent but also showed lineage- and LSPA type -dominant patterns of divergence
(Table 4). Among the 31 E. coli O157:H7 strains examined, only lineage I strain 97701 (PT14) did not have a
positive signal for stx2 A and B subunit genes. In 97701,
other ORFs in this region were also divergent suggesting
that bacteriophage Sp5 was not present in its genome.

There were two clusters of lineage and LSPA type divergent
ORFs in S-loop#69. The first cluster, consisting of ORFs
ECs1160 to ECs1163 located upstream of the stx2 genes in
E. coli Sakai, was missing in all four lineage I/II and the 12
lineage II strains but was conserved in all lineage I strains
except strain 97701. The ORFs within this cluster encoded
putative bacteriophage proteins and hypothetical proteins.
The second cluster of divergent ORFs in S-loop#69/OI#45
consisted of 21 ORFs, that were missing in 11 out of 12
lineage II strains and present in all four lineage I/II strains

and 14 of 15 lineage I strains. These lineage I-dominant
ORFs were located downstream of the stx2 genes and
encoded putative bacteriophage proteins and hypothetical proteins and correspond to the late region of Sp5 of
Sakai. PCR primers that flank S-loop#69, were used to
amplify the corresponding DNA fragment in the lineage II
E. coli strain FRIK 920. The nucleotide sequence of the
amplicon showed that Sakai Sp5 prophage is not integrated into the chromosome at this site in E. coli FRIK 920.
iv) S-loop#72/OI#43, 48
S-loop#72 in E. coli Sakai, which corresponds to duplicate
OI#43 and OI#48 in E. coli EDL933, consists of the degenerate prophage SpLE1 in Sakai. S-loop#72 and OI#43,48
are also called tellurite resistance- and adherence-conferring islands because they contain genes responsible for
these phenotypes [27]. Putative virulence-associated ORFs

located outside of the lineage I and lineage I/II-specific
cluster, including the urease genes (ECs1321-ECs1327),
genes for tellurite resistance (ECs1351-ECs1358), and iha
(IrgA homologue adhesin) (ECs1360) [27,28], were
found by CGH to be conserved in all E. coli O157:H7
strains tested. However, 12 ORFs within S-loop#72 were
lineage I and lineage I/II-specific (Table 4). The nucleotide
sequence [GenBank:EF112440] of the FRIK 920 amplification product obtained for this region had high similarity to the E. coli Sakai sequences, except that a segment
10.8 kb from the 3' end of ECs1377 to the 5' end of
ECs1391 was missing. The missing region includes two
putative transposases ECs1380 and ECs1381, which were
not identified by CGH. With the exception of ECs1382,
which encodes a HecB-like protein, and ECs1388 (pchD),
a PerC-homologue [29], all other lineage I and lineage I/
II-specific ORFs in this region encode hypothetical proteins.

2 Divergent

v) S-loop#78/OI#51
S-loop#78/OI#51, which corresponds to prophage Sp7 in
Sakai, contained a cluster of 21 ORFs, located between
ECs1574 and ECs1600 of E. coli Sakai, that was absent
from all lineage II and lineage I/II strains but present in all
lineage I strains (Table 4). The S-loop#78 divergent ORFs
encoded hypothetical proteins of unknown function and
putative bacteriophage-associated proteins. Another ORF
present in this region, ECs1588 (pchE) [29], which
encodes a PerC-homologue, was present in all lineage I
and lineage I/II strains but not ten of the twelve lineage II
strains tested. Repeated attempts to amplify the divergent
region in S-loop#78 by long template PCR with FRIK 920
DNA were unsuccessful.
vi) S-loop#83/OI#55
A cluster of 15 lineage I and lineage I/II-specific ORFs,
ECs1691-ECs1705, were detected across S-loop#83/
OI#55 and its surrounding sequences (Table 4). Five ORFs
within the boundaries of S-loop#83, ORFs ECs1693ECs1697, are homologous to the prrA-modD-yc73-fepC
gene cluster located on the pyelonephritis and cystitis
pathogenicity island of uropathogenic E. coli CFT073,
which was proposed to be involved in iron uptake in this
strain [30]. The S-loop#83 ORFs ECs1698-ECs1699
located immediately downstream from this gene cluster

are also conserved in E. coli CFT073 and encode putative
transport proteins that may be involved in iron transport.
Two lineage I- and lineage I/II-specific ORFs located
upstream of S-loop#83 encoded hypothetical proteins,
and five lineage I- and lineage I/II-specific ORFs located
downstream of S-loop#83 encoded components of the E.
coli phosphotransferase system (PTS), or PTS-dependent
dihydroxyacetone kinase enzymes. These are ECs1701
and ECs1702, which together are homologous to the periplasmic trehalase treA in E. coli K12 [26], ECs1703, a putative PTS system enzyme I ycgC gene, and ECs1704 and
ECs1705, which encode putative dihydroxyacetone
kinase genes dhaK1 and dhaK2.
The PCR fragment amplified with DNA from FRIK 920
showed that both the lineage I- and lineage I/II-specific
ORFs identified by CGH as well as two putative transposases were missing. The FRIK 920 sequence [GenBank:EF112438] also showed that a portion of E. coli K12
DNA sequence (K12 coordinates 1250409–1253544) that
was absent from E. coli Sakai was present in the chromosome of FRIK 920. The E. coli K12 sequence in this region
contained portions of b1201 and b1202 ORFs, which
encode a PTS-dependent dihydroxyacetone kinase operon
regulator dhaR and a protein of unknown function with

both Pertactin adhesin and autotransporter domains,
respectively.
vii) S-loop#85/OI#71
Two lineage I- and lineage I/II-specific ORF were detected
in S-loop#85/OI#71, which corresponds to Sakai
prophage Sp9 (Table 4). The recently described non-LEE
encoded effectors nleA, nleH1-2 and nleF are encoded by
ORFs ECs1812, ECs1814 and ECs1815, respectively,
within this S-loop [31-33]. Although ECs1814 and
ECs1815 were lineage I and lineage I/II-specific, ECs1812
was present in all E. coli O157:H7 strains tested. Repeated
attempts to amplify this divergent region in S-loop#85 by
PCR with FRIK 920 DNA were unsuccessful.
viii) Sp10
The Sakai prophage Sp10 region, which is described as a
hypervariable locus in EDL933, contains S-loops 91, 92,
and 93. Sixteen ORFs within this prophage were observed
to be lineage I-specific and one lineage-dominant (Table
4). This region of divergence in lineage I/II and lineage II
strains extends from the prophage integrase ECs1929 to
the hypothetical protein ECs1955. Most of the downstream ORFs in prophage Sp10, however, are not represented in the MWG microarray, so it could not be
determined if these ORFs were present or absent in the E.
coli O157:H7 strains tested. Based on DNA sequence analysis [GenBank:EF112441], the region corresponding to
Sp10 in E. coli Sakai DNA was missing entirely from lineage II strain FRIK 920. This prophage contains predominantly ORFs that encode for hypothetical proteins and
bacteriophage-associated proteins. Other ORFs of interest
within this region include ECs1941 and ECs1942, which
encode proteins with low homology to bacteriophage regulatory proteins, and ECs1989, which encodes a putative
Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase.
ix) S-loop#153/OI#93
S-loop#153/OI#93 corresponds to the stx1-converting
prophage Sp15 in E. coli Sakai. All lineage I/II and lineage
II strains and the lineage I PT14 strain LRH6 were divergent in Sakai ORFs ECs2989 to ECs2995 within Sloop#153 (Table 4). The ORFs ECs2989 and ECs2993
encode putative regulatory proteins, while the others
encode hypothetical proteins of unknown function or
prophage-related proteins. Repeated attempts to amplify
this divergent region in S-loop#153 by PCR with FRIK 920
DNA were unsuccessful. However, nucleotide sequence
analysis of DNA amplified from the region extending
from the flanking region to within the stx1-converting
prophage showed that integration site of the prophage to
be the same in both the lineage II strain FRIK 920 and lineage I strain Sakai (data not shown).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/121

x) S-loop#286/OI#172
S-loop#286/OI#172 corresponds to a cryptic prophagelike element SpLE5 in E. coli Sakai. Ten ORFs in this region
in Sakai and EDL933 were present in all lineage I/II strains
and all lineage I strains except those of PT 31 but not lineage II strains (Table 4). The corresponding region [GenBank:EF112443] in E. coli FRIK 920 was homologous to E.
coli Sakai DNA sequence but was missing the DNA segment corresponding to the SpLE5 element (from ECs5242
to ECs5252). The divergent SpLE5 ORFs include bacteriophage-associated genes and several genes encoding
hypothetical proteins of unknown function. One of these
hypothetical genes, ECs5250, was shown through transposon mutagenesis to be required for intestinal colonization in calves [34]. Another ORF, ECs5252, is a putative
transcriptional regulator.
xi) KI#71, KI#121, and E. coli genomic backbone
Four ORFs in K-island (KI) #71 (b1142, b1147, b1148,
and b1152) and four ORFs in KI#121 (b2360, b2361,
b2362 and b2363) were identified as being present in all
lineage II strains but not lineage I strains. Only the two
ORFs in KI#121 (b2360, b2361) were also present in lineage I/II strains. All of these ORFs above encode hypothetical proteins of unknown function (Table 4).

Two ORFs, b1201 and b1202, which were located on the
conserved E. coli genomic backbone, were only found in
E. coli K12 and E. coli O157:H7 lineage I/II and lineage II
strains (Table 4). ORFs b1201 and b1202 encode a putative sensor-type regulator and a putative adhesion and
penetration protein, respectively. Lineage I strain E. coli
Sakai possesses truncated versions of these ORFs.
Two other ORFs found in the E. coli genomic backbone,
b1519 and b1520, were lineage I and lineage I/II-specific.
These ORFs encode a putative trans-aconitate methyltransferase enzyme and a hypothetical membrane protein
of unknown function. DNA sequence analysis [GenBank:EF112442] demonstrated that these two ORFs were
incomplete in lineage II strain FRIK920.
Lineage, LSPA type and phage type distribution of ORFs in
other virulence-related genomic islands
All genes in S-loop#205/OI#122, which encode two toxins and a PagC-like virulence factor, were conserved
among all E. coli O157:H7 strains, except for ORF
ECs3861. This ORF, which encode a putative adherence
factor, was divergent in the lineage II strain FRIK 920. In
S-loop#225/OI#138, which contains genes for a fatty acid
biosynthesis system, only the putative acyl carrier gene
ECs4328 showed variation, and this variation was not lineage-related. All other ORFs in S-loop#225/OI#138 were
conserved across all E. coli O157:H7 strains examined. In
the LEE-containing S-loop#244/OI#148 [5,31], all ORFs

non-LEE encoded effectors nleH1-2 (ECs1814) and nleF
(ECs1815) of S-loop#85 [31,32] and putative transcriptional regulator pchD (ECs1388) of S-loop#72 [29], were
both lineage I and lineage I/II-specific (see above). Other
virulence-associated genes, such as espF (ECs2715), enterotoxin-encoding sen (ECs3855), porcine EPEC O45 paa
gene homologue (ECs1772), and calcium-binding and
heat-extractable autotransporter gene cah (ECs1396),
were present in all of the E. coli O157:H7 strains examined
[37-41].

were conserved across all E. coli O157:H7 strains examined, except for five ORFs encoding hypothetical proteins
within the prophage SpLE4 region of the LEE (ECs4534,
ECs4535, ECs4537, ECs4542, and ECs4544), which
encode a putative integrase and genes for hypothetical
proteins of unknown function. These ORFs were missing
in seven lineage II strains (LRH13, R1797, EC2000623,
EC20000703, EC20020119, FRIK1985, and EC970520).
The conserved LEE genes included eae, which encodes γintimin, tir (translocated intimin receptor), map (mitochondrial-associated protein), the genes for the type III
secretion system (escCDFJRSTUV, cesDT, and sepDLQZ),
and genes encoding the system's other secreted proteins
(espA, espB, espD, and espF) [35]. Homologues of non-LEE

Genomic characteristics of the lineage-specific segments
To visualize the distribution of the lineage-specific and
lineage-dominant genome segments, the segments were
mapped onto the O157:H7 strain Sakai genome using
Microbial Genome Viewer [42] along with plots of Codon
Adaptation Indices (CAI) and GC content. As shown in
Figure 3, the lineage-specific segments (denoted by letters
a-o) are distributed throughout several segments of the
genome, with two main clusters (cluster c-j and cluster mb). Correlation exists between positioning of the lineagespecific segments and the origin and terminus of chromosome replication. Nearly half of the lineage I-specific segments (c-j) are concentrated in a 1.0 Mb segment of the
genome that includes the replication terminus (at position 1.9 Mb) while several segments in the m-n region are
likewise clustered near the replication origin, positioned
at 4.8 Mb. However, there appears to be some bias in the
distribution of the lineage-specific segments with respect
to the two replichores, with segments n-h occurring
within replichore 2 while only segments i-m are found in
replichore 1. Replichore 1 is 290 Kb longer than replichore 2 in the Sakai genome sequence [9], which is a lineage I strain, and it is possible that symmetry is a driving
force in shaping the genomes of the lineage II strains.
Genomotyping of E. coli O157:H7 strains
A dendrogram based on the Pearson correlation analysis
of microarray data for all 31 E. coli O157:H7 strains is presented in Figure 4. Three distinct groups of strains, corresponding to lineage I, lineage I/II (LSPA 211111/PT2) and
lineage II (LSPA types 222222, 222221, 222211, and
222212) strains are evident. The three PT31 strains within
lineage I are grouped close to each other in the dendrogram. In contrast, PT14 and PT23 strains (the predominant strains in lineage I and lineage II groups,
respectively) display variable genetic distances with
respect to other strains of the same PT and other strains of
different PTs within the same OBGS lineage.

Discussion
To our knowledge this is the first time that CGH has been
applied to such a diverse collection of E. coli O157:H7

Page 10 of 16

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:121

strains. Results of this study suggest that CGH is a robust
and discriminating method for comparing large numbers
of E. coli O157:H7 strains. Twenty-one of the oligonucleotides with divergent signals for Sakai DNA formed part of
the S-loop#108/OI#57 genomic island which was confirmed to be missing from both of the Sakai strains in our
collection (data not shown), suggesting that this element
was lost during storage or subculture in the laboratory.
There are a number of phage-related ORFs in S-loop#108
(Sp12), and the contribution of this gene cluster, if any to
the survival and/or virulence of E. coli O157:H7 strains in
nature is unknown. The high level of agreement between
the CGH hybridization signals observed and the expected
results for ORFs that were reported to be present and those
that were reported to be divergent suggests that CGH is a
reliable method of determining genomic composition.
Furthermore, all areas of lineage I-specific divergence were
in clusters of two or more ORFs, so it seems unlikely that
the divergent regions observed in this study are a result of
printing or hybridization errors.
An additional line of evidence in support of the reliability
of the CGH data was obtained from parallel selective subtractive hybridization (SSH) studies conducted by our
research group [43]. CGH identified all of the nine lineage
I-dominant chromosomal genomic regions identified by
SSH as well as two additional ones. Finally, in several of
the areas where lineage I-specific divergence was inferred
using CGH, sequence differences between these two lineages were verified following amplification, cloning and
sequencing of DNA from the lineage II E. coli strain FRIK
920. Taken together, these findings represent a rigorous
and comprehensive validation of the CGH data presented
in this study.
The CGH data presented in this study provide evidence of
both regions of genomic stability and regions of genomic
variability that exist within populations of E. coli
O157:H7. A total of 4084 oligonucleotides hybridized
with DNA from all of the 31 E. coli O157:H7 strains
tested. The ORFs which hybridized with these oligonucleotide probes approximate the conserved portion of the E.
coli O157:H7 genome and likely include the core genes
required for survival of this bacterial pathogen [44,45].
Wick et al identified 4230 conserved genes in E. coli
O157:H7(:H-) and closely related E. coli O55:H7 strains
using the same oligonucleotide set that was used in this
study [13], however, a very limited number of O157 and
O157-related strains were examined in the latter study. In
contrast, Dobrindt et al. identified 3100 core genes in the
genomes of 26 E. coli strains of different serotypes associated with both intestinal and extra-intestinal illness [44].
It would seem reasonable to hypothesize that the larger
the collection of strains from a specific E. coli serotype and
the more diverse the collection of E. coli strains, the fewer

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/121

core genes and the more VAP genes that would be encountered.
A total of 1751 VAP ORFs were identified in E. coli
O157:H7 strains in the present study. These ORFs existed
as clusters across the E. coli Sakai and EDL933 chromosomes (Figures 1 and 2). The number of VAP ORFs identified in this study was significantly higher than that
identified in the CGH study by Ogura et al. [46] which
employed an E. coli Sakai-based microarray to examine
genomic variability within eight human E. coli O157:H7
isolates. The higher number of VAP ORFs observed in this
study, likely reflects the higher number of strains tested,
the inclusion of both human and bovine-derived strains,
and the fact that the MWG microarray used in this study is
based on ORFs from E. coli O157:H7 Sakai and EDL933
strains and an E. coli K12 strain rather than just E. coli
Sakai.
In addition to genomotyping an extensive collection of E.
coli O157:H7 strains, we used CGH to compare the
genomic profiles of E. coli O157:H7 lineage I, lineage I/II
and lineage II strains. These observations extend well
beyond those obtained from previous E. coli K12 and
O157:H7 microarray studies [13,44-46] and other
genome analysis techniques such as WGPCR Scanning
[47]. CGH shows promise as a method that can not only
verify the existence of the lineages and categorize strains
into subtypes, but also of providing insight into specific
genetic differences that could be related to differences in
their ecology and evolution. The 132 VAP ORFs that were
differentially distributed between the two OBGS lineages
were of particular interest in this study, since these ORFs
likely confer to strains possessing them the unique ecological or virulence characteristics associated with these lineages.
These 132 lineage-divergent VAP ORFs were clustered
within several chromosomal regions, many of which were
associated within E. coli O157:H7 Sakai and EDL933 Sloops and OIs.
Prophage were originally suspected as either causing or at
least correlating with divergence of the genomes in lineage
I and lineage II strains [19] and other studies have shown
that prophage regions of the genome are highly polymorphic in different O157:H7 strains [47-51]. It is therefore
not surprising that many of the VAPs occur within
prophage segments because these elements have significant homology to other prophages in the genome, making
them hotspots for recombination. Moreover, these
regions of the genome also are topologically distinct. The
results of distribution mapping of the lineage-specific
VAPs (Figure 2) also implies bias, suggesting that genome
symmetry may be superimposed onto homology and

O157:H7 strains
The dendrogram generated by CGH analysis of E. coli
The dendrogram generated by CGH analysis of E.
coli O157:H7 strains. Data generated from two arrays for
each strain have been averaged and analyzed with acuity 3.1.
The 6057 locus tags of open reading frames of three E. coli
strains (EDL933, Sakai, and K12 MG1655) in the image were
organized alphabetically. The dendrogram was generated by
hierarchical cluster analysis (Pearson correlation) of log2
(RAT2N) of each strain with Acuity 3.1. In the colour

corresponds to spots that are absent (divergent) with high
certainty, the brightest red indicates spots that are present
(conserved) with the greatest certainty, the black indicates
spots that are uncertain or slightly divergent.
topology as driving forces shaping the genome during
divergence of the two lineages. When combined with the
fact that some of the genes present in the affected
prophage or pathogenicity islands could influence expression of virulence genes (e.g. the perC-like genes ECs1388
and ECs1588), it seems reasonable to conclude that multiple evolutionary forces may be working on these
genome segments.
For many of these divergent regions, a bias in PT was also
evident. Divergent ORFs identified in S-loops 69, 78, and
153 and in Sp10 (S-loops 91, 92 and 93) were absent in
all lineage II strains. Similarly, lineage I PT31 strains and
lineage II strains also lacked the same ORFs in Sloop#286. Lineage I/II strains were all of the same LSPA
type, 211111, and of PT 2 and formed a distinct cluster in
a dendrogram based on the Pearson correlation analysis
of microarray data for all 31 E. coli O157:H7 strains (Figure 4). PT23 was the most common PT of lineage II strains
included in this study. All PT23 strains from Canada
grouped together within the lineage II cluster on this dendrogram, despite different isolation dates, host origins,
and geographic origin within Canada. In contrast to the
apparent clonality of PT2, PT31, and PT23 strains, strains
of PT14, the predominant lineage I PT, were highly divergent on this dendrogram and some PT14 strains appeared

to be closely related to other PTs, such as PT87, PT21, and
PT31. These results suggest that there is a relationship
between genomotype and lineage and between genomotype and some PTs for E. coli O157:H7 strains, however, a
larger number of strains from different geographical
regions need to be examined to verify these relationships.
The lineage, LSPA type and PT-specific and lineage, LSPA
type or PT-dominant VAP ORFs identified in this study
were associated with several known or suspected virulence
genes, including regions of divergence within S-loop 69,
which encodes Stx2. A number of studies have shown
divergence in the structure of prophages encoding Stx
genes in E. coli O157:H7, their insertion sites within the
genome, and the type and level of toxin produced
[22,47,50,52,53]. In addition to this, the absence of the
non-LEE encoded effector genes nleH1-2 and nleF and the
perC homologue gene pchD in lineage II strains are likely
to affect their phenotype. However, further study is
required to determine the precise role of these differences
in the genomes E. coli O157:H7 lineage I and lineage II
strains on their ecology and virulence.

Conclusion
CGH was used to evaluate genomic variability within a
collection of 31 E. coli O157:H7 strains. A total of 4084
ORFs were detected in all of the strains, suggesting that
they represent core genes conserved in all E. coli O157:H7
strains. Among the 1751 VAP ORFs were clusters of ORFs
associated with bacteriophages and other genetically
mobile elements. Several clusters of ORFs were lineagespecific or dominant. A number of the genes within lineage-specific or dominant ORF clusters have been associated with virulence in E. coli O157:H7. Nucleotide
sequencing of lineage-specific or dominant regions in the
lineage II E. coli FRIK 920 confirmed that the alterations in
the genome detected by CGH are the results of genomic
deletions or insertions. The genomic composition of these
strains within lineages and subgroups suggests that both
genomic divergence from an ancestral form and the lateral
transfer of gene clusters have contributed to their evolution.

Methods
Bacterial strains and preparation of genomic DNA
The 15 lineage I (including EDL933 and Sakai strains for
which the genomic sequence has been determined) (LSPA
111111), four PT 2 (LSPA 211111) strains and 12 lineage
II (LSPA 222222) E. coli O157:H7 strains included in this
study were obtained from a variety of human and bovine
sources (Table 2). OBGS types of all 31 strains were determined as previously described [19]. Phage typing of E. coli
O157:H7 isolates was carried out as described previously
[54]. The E. coli strains were grown overnight in 45 mL of
Brain-Heart-Infusion (BHI) broth. The cultures were centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 minutes and the pellet was

dissolved in 15 mL of 10 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH
8.0), 1 mM EDTA, 100 μg/mL proteinase K and 0.5% SDS.
This suspension was incubated at 50°C for 2 h and
extracted with an equal volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). Following centrifugation for 10
min at 8000 rpm, the upper phase was removed and precipitated by adding 0.1 volume of 3 M NaOAc (pH 5.2)
and 2 volumes of 99% ethanol. The DNA precipitate was
then spooled out of the solution using a sterile glass rod,
washed with 70% ethanol, and dissolved in 5 mL of TE
(10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) buffer.
Array preparation
Corning Ultra-Gap II slides (Corning, Acton, MA) were
spotted with the MWG E. coli O157:H7 array set (MWG
Biotech). The MWG array consists of 6167 50-mer oligonucleotides covering the genomes of E. coli K-12
(MG1655) [26] and E. coli O157:H7 strains Sakai (RIMD
0509952) [9] and EDL933 (ATCC700927) [7]. Prior to
use, each array was pre-hybridized at 50°C in a solution
of 5× SSC, 0.1% SDS and 0.1% BSA for one h, washed
completely in dH2O, rinsed with isopropanol, and then
centrifuged and dried.
Hybridizations
5 μg of test genomic DNA was digested with EcoRV and
PstI restriction enzymes, 3 μg of which was labelled with
ULYSIS Alexa Fluor 647 dye (Invitrogen, Burlington,
ON.). The laboratory strain E. coli K-12 (MG1655) and the
two sequenced O157:H7 strains, Sakai (RIMD 0509952)
and EDL933 (ATCC700927), were digested in an analogous fashion, and 1 μg of each was combined and labelled
with Alexa Fluor 546 to create the reference DNA (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON). Unincorporated dye was removed
using Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Mississauga,
ON), according to the manufacturer's instructions, and
the DNA eluted in 30 μl of TE (10/1) buffer. Labelled
DNA was vacuum-dried and resuspended in 20 μl dH2O.
A 70 μl hybridization solution consisting of 30% formamide, 5× SSC, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mg/ml sonicated salmon
sperm DNA, and equal amounts of test and reference
DNA, each containing at least 30 pmol of incorporated
dye, was denatured at 95°C for 5 min and briefly centrifuged to collect the contents. DNAs were hybridized to the
array overnight (~16 hours) at 42°C and washed according to the modified Corning method (Corning). Arrays
were scanned with a GenePix 4000B scanner (Axon
Instruments, Redwood City, CA) and processed using
GenePix Pro 5.0. Two slides were hybridized per strain
with two dye-swap repeats per slide.
Microarray data analysis
Microarray data were normalized using the Ratio-based
and Lowess method in Acuity 3.1 (Axon instruments)
before analysis. The normalized data for all 31 strains

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/121

were converted to log2 (Fluor 647/Fluor 546) in Acuity 3.1
and subsequently analyzed in Microsoft Excel. Control,
blank, and test spots with a mean intensity below that of
the mean of all negative controls were removed from the
analysis. The arithmetic mean of the remaining spots
across the four duplicates was taken to construct the dataset. Acuity 3.1 was then used to construct a Pearson centred hierarchical dendrogram and GACK (Genomotyping
Analysis by Charles Kim) [55] was used to generate a cut
off value for identifying the presence or absence of genes.
Identification of lineage- and phage type-dominant ORF
clusters
The presence or absence of each ORF was compared for all
15 lineage I, 4 lineage I/II and 12 lineage II E. coli
O157:H7 strains included in the study, and ORFs that
were variably absent and present (VAP) within this strain
collection were identified. The proportion of strains of
each OBGS lineage and phage type (PT) containing each
VAP ORF was determined. ORFs that were present in
100% of strains in a lineage or PT and absent in all strains
of the other lineage or PTs were designated as lineage or
PT-specific. ORFs that were present in greater than 80 % of
strains in a lineage or PT and absent in greater than 92 %
of strains of the other lineage or PTs were defined as lineage or PT-dominant.

For visualization of VAP distribution, each locus tag was
given a binary score, 1 for presence and 0 for absence
based on GACK analysis. A single composite table was
generated for all strains and sorted in Microsoft Excel to
identify lineage-specific polymorphisms. This generated a
set of 132 loci showing a lineage-specific distribution. The
binary distribution was then represented in RGB format
(1 = green, 0 = red), converted to a single text file, and the
file uploaded and represented on the Microbial Genome
Viewer [42].
DNA sequences from the lineage-conserved regions flanking lineage and PT-dominant regions were used to design
primers for PCR amplification, cloning and DNA
sequence analysis of these divergent regions (Table 5).
DNA from the lineage II strain E. coli FRIK 920 was used
to amplify divergent regions corresponding to E. coli Sakai
S-loops 14, 16, 69, 72, 78, 83, 153, and 286, backbone
regions b1519-b1520 and SP10. These divergent regions
were amplified by PCR using AmpliTaq® polymerase
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) or long template
PCR using the Advantage™ 2 PCR Kit (BD Biosciences
Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and then cloned into the pGEMT Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI), the pCR 2.1 TOPO
TA vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), or the Expand cloning kit (Roche Applied Science). The primers and annealing temperatures used in these reactions are summarized
in Table 5. The cloned sequences were analyzed on an ABI
