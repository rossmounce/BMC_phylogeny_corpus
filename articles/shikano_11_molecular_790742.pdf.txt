Molecular sexing and population genetic
inference using a sex-linked microsatellite
marker in the nine-spined stickleback
(Pungitius pungitius)
Takahito Shikano*, Gábor Herczeg and Juha Merilä

Abstract
Background: Sex-specific DNA markers can serve as tools for molecular sex identification, as well as for population
genetic inferences. We investigated the potential utility of a microsatellite marker located on sex chromosomes for
molecular sexing of Fennoscandian nine-spined sticklebacks (Pungitius pungitius). In addition, we assessed the
patterns of allelic differentiation between X and Y chromosomes across the populations to examine if the sex
chromosomes had been highly differentiated prior to the postglacial recolonization of Fennoscandia.
Findings: A clear and consistent sex difference in allele size distribution was observed at the Stn19 locus
throughout the 15 populations investigated. Males were distinguishable by the presence of distinct male-specific
alleles, which were lacking in all females. There was no indication of recombination between sex and the Stn19
locus in the 647 individuals tested. The degree of genetic differentiation between the X and Y chromosomes was
much higher than that of interpopulation differentiation in the respective chromosomes.
Conclusions: Our results indicate that the Stn19 locus can be used for molecular sex identification in
Fennoscandian nine-spined sticklebacks. The consistent pattern of high allelic differentiation between the X and Y
chromosomes in these populations suggests that the sex chromosomes were already highly differentiated prior to
the postglacial recolonization of Fennoscandia.

Background
Unlike mammalian or avian species, fish exhibit diverse
sex-determination systems [1]. Even though many fish
do not possess heteromorphic sex chromosomes, genetic
sex determination has been found in a wide variety of
fish species [1]. This was initially demonstrated in species displaying sex-linked phenotypic traits such as skin
pigmentation or coloration [2-5]. Similarly, sex-linked
allozyme markers have been identified in some fish species [e.g. [6-8]]. Nevertheless, it is important to note
that sex-linked phenotypic traits or allozyme markers
are not necessarily encoded by sex-linked genes, since
the sex linkage can be a consequence of sex-specific
gene expression of autosomal genes [1]. In contrast,

DNA polymorphisms are not affected by altered physiological and environmental conditions, and thus are better suited for sex identification. DNA markers tightly
associated with phenotypic sex have been reported in
several fish species [9-13]. Such DNA markers can serve
as simple and reliable diagnostic tools for sex identification of immature individuals.
Sex-linked DNA markers can also provide significant
insights into demographic history and phylogenetic relationships among populations. In particular, polymorphic
Y chromosome markers are useful in tracing paternal
lineages in wild populations [14,15]. In humans, Y chromosome markers have been employed for the evaluation
of the origin of non-African populations and sex-biased
migration [16,17]. Despite their advantages, the utility of
Y chromosome polymorphisms is limited to humans
and some other mammals [15]. This is partly due to the
difficulty of discovering polymorphic Y chromosome

markers for organisms in which sex chromosomes are
not highly differentiated [15]. As such, few studies have
been conducted on phylogenetic and population genetic
analyses using polymorphic Y chromosome markers in
fish [18].
Sticklebacks (Gasterosteidae) are widely used as model
organisms in evolutionary biology [19-21]. The ninespined stickleback (Pungitius pungitius) is a cold-water
adapted species having a circumpolar distribution in the
Northern Hemisphere and is found in a wide variety of
habitats [19]. This species possesses a heteromorphic
XY chromosome pair corresponding to three-spined
stickleback linkage group 12 [22,23]. Microsatellite analyses have revealed a high degree of genetic differentiation between the X and Y chromosomes over most of
their length in nine-spined sticklebacks (T. Shikano, Y.
Shimada & J. Merilä, unpublished). This implies that
microsatellite markers can be used as a diagnostic tool
for sex identification in this species. However, the practical utility of this approach needs to be validated as the
results were obtained using only two particular populations. The necessity of such a validation is exemplified
by previous studies that have demonstrated populationspecificity of molecular sex identification [10,11,24].
We investigated the potential utility of a microsatellite
marker located on sex chromosomes for molecular sex
identification in a large number of Fennoscandian ninespined stickleback populations. These populations are
highly subdivided from each other as a result of their
postglacial colonizations following the last glacial maximum (ca. 12 000 years ago) [25]. We therefore hypothesized that similar patterns of allelic differentiation
between X and Y chromosomes would be observed
across the populations if the sex chromosomes had been
highly differentiated prior to postglacial recolonization.
To gain insights into sex chromosome differentiation
and population history, we also assessed the degree of
genetic differentiation between and within the sex chromosomes across the populations using the sex-linked
microsatellite marker.

Materials and methods
Samples

A total of 647 adult fish were collected with seine nets
or minnow traps from 15 locations, comprising three
coastal, two lake and 10 pond sites in Fennoscandia
(Figure 1; Table 1). Phenotypic sex was initially determined by visual inspection (i.e. nuptial coloration of
males and gravidity of females; 603 specimens) or by
examining gonads (44 specimens) after the fish had
been anesthetised with an overdose of MS-222 (tricane
methanesulphonate). All procedures were performed
under license from the Animal Experiment Board in
Finland (ELLA; STH379A). Total DNA was extracted

from fin clips using a silica-fine based purification
method [26] following proteinase K digestion.
Genotyping

We surveyed genomic locations of the 11 three-spined
stickleback microsatellite loci previously tested in ninespined sticklebacks [27] by subjecting these flanking
sequences to BLASTN searches against the three-spined
stickleback genome [28]. The microsatellite locus Stn19
[29] was mapped to three-spined stickleback linkage
group 12, which corresponds to sex chromosomes in
the nine-spined stickleback [22,23]. We genotyped this
marker in 647 individuals (399 phenotypic females and
248 phenotypic males) from the 15 populations listed in
Table 1. The forward primer (5’-ACAGGCATGAATGACACTGG-3’) was labelled with a fluorescent dye,
and the 5’-end of the reverse primer (5’-GATGAGCACAACACCTGAGC-3’) was modified with a GTTT-tail
[30]. Polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) were carried
out using the Qiagen Multiplex PCR Kit (Qiagen) in
10 μl reaction volumes containing 1× Qiagen Multiplex
PCR Master Mix, 0.5× Q-Solution, 2 pmol of each primer and approx. 10-20 ng of template DNA. The reactions were performed by the following cycle: an initial
activation step at 95°C for 15 min, followed by 30 s at
94°C, 90 s at 53°C and 60 s at 72°C for 30 cycles with a
final extension at 60°C for 5 min. PCR products were
visualized with a MegaBACE 1000 automated sequencer
(Amersham Biosciences) and their sizes were determined with ET-ROX 550 size standard (Amersham

Biosciences). Alleles were scored using Fragment Profiler 1.2 (Amersham Biosciences) with visual inspection
and manual corrections of alleles.
Data analyses

Expected heterozygosity and FIS were calculated according to population and sex using FSTAT 2.9.3 [31]. The
significance of FIS was determined by 10 000 permutations. Sequential Bonferroni correction was applied to
minimize type I errors [32]. To identify X and Y chromosomal alleles, genotypic frequencies and allele size
distributions were compared between females and
males. The degree of genetic differentiation in X and Y
chromosomal alleles - both within and among populations - was evaluated using the (δμ)2 distance, which is
the squared difference in the number of microsatellite
repeats [33]. This analysis was performed for the X and
Y chromosome alleles identified in males, using Microsatellite Analyzer 4.05 [34]. Since two populations (FIPOR and SE-SKA; see also Results) were solely comprised of females (phenotypic and genotypic), these
populations were excluded from this analysis. A
UPGMA dendrogram was constructed from the (δμ) 2
distances using Populations 1.2 [35].
We note that the accuracy of phenotypic sexing was
critical to our inference, and therefore specific care was
taken to ensure that phenotypic sexes were correct. In
our initial screen, 37 (5.7%) individuals showed a mismatch between phenotypic and genotypic (see below)
sex. All the mismatches corresponded to individuals
that had been sexed on the basis of visual criteria; reexamination of these individuals by gonadal inspection
confirmed their true sex, which matched the genotypic
sex perfectly.

Results
Across the 15 populations, a total of five alleles were
found at the locus Stn19 (Table 1). The number of
observed alleles was three in females and four in males.
In each population, one or two alleles were observed in
females, whereas two to four alleles were detected in
males (Table 2). No polymorphism was found in two
populations (FI-POR and SE-SKA), from which only
phenotypic females were available (Table 2). FIS values
were nonsignificant for females in all populations (P >
0.05; Table 2). In contrast, all males were heterozygous
at this locus, and accordingly, most populations exhibited significant negative FIS values in males (P < 0.05;
Table 2).
Allele size distributions were clearly different between
the sexes, and this pattern was consistent throughout
the 15 populations (Figure 2). Only shorter (154, 158
and 160) alleles were identified in females, whereas both
shorter and longer (174 and 176) alleles were detected
in males (Figure 2). In fact, all males possessed one
short and one long allele. Therefore, these longer alleles
can be inferred to be located on the Y chromosome.
Assuming that the longer alleles are located on the Y
chromosome, the number of alleles observed on this chromosome was one or two in each population (Table 2).
Similarly, one or two alleles were observed in each population for the shorter alleles, which are presumed to be
located on the X chromosome (Table 2). Polymorphism
for Y chromosomal alleles was found only in one population (SE-BOL; Table 2). The number of alleles observed in
each population was slightly but significantly larger in the
alleles putatively located on the X chromosome than those
on the Y chromosome (paired t-test, t12 = 2.31, P < 0.05).
X chromosomal alleles were polymorphic in four out of

(RU-LEV; Table 2).
The (δμ)2 distance was much larger between the X and
Y chromosomal alleles than among alleles within each
chromosome (Additional file 1). The UPGMA dendrogram constructed from the (δμ)2 distances showed two
major clusters corresponding to the X and Y chromosomal
alleles across the populations (Figure 3). The (δμ)2 distance between the X and Y chromosomal alleles was 64.0
to 81.0 in each population with a mean of 71.4 (SD = 6.9).

Discussion
Our results demonstrated a clear and consistent difference in allele size distributions at the microsatellite locus
Stn19 between sexes in a number of Fennoscandian
populations. Males were distinguishable by the presence
of distinct sex-specific alleles (174 and 176), whereas
females were characterized by the absence of these
alleles. Given the male heterogamy in this species [36],
these male-specific alleles should be located on the Y
chromosome. Since the observed pattern was consistent
in a large number of individuals from various populations, allelic variation in this locus can be used as a diagnostic tool for sex identification in immature individuals,
as well as in adults when phenotypic criteria are deemed
to be unreliable. In our experience, phenotypic sexing by
using external criteria is not possible at juvenile stages,
and will sometimes lead to errors even in adult fish.

Despite our large sample size, we did not find any
indication of recombination between the sex-determination locus and the Stn19 locus. Consistent patterns of
sex-linked allelic differentiation were observed for other
microsatellite loci located on the sex chromosomes
independent of their physical location (T. Shikano, Y.
Shimada & J. Merilä, unpublished). Therefore, distinct
allelic divergence at the Stn19 locus between the sex
chromosomes could be due to suppression of recombination between these chromosomes rather than due to
tight physical linkage between the Stn19 locus and the
sex-determination locus. Indeed, the sex chromosomes
of nine-spined sticklebacks are cytogenetically distinguishable [36]. Thus, both molecular and cytogenetic
characteristics indicate that sex chromosomes are highly
differentiated from each other in this species. Yet, the
fact that Stn19 and other sex-linked microsatellite loci
(T. Shikano, Y. Shimada & J. Merilä, unpublished) maintain homologous amplification sites between the X and
Y chromosomes suggests a high level of DNA similarity
between these chromosomes. In the case of humans,
where sex chromosomes initiated differentiation 240320 million years ago [37], X and Y homologous microsatellite markers have been developed in limited homologous regions of these chromosomes [38-41].
Since northern Europe was covered by the continental
ice sheet until approximately 12 000 years ago, ninespined sticklebacks must have colonized Fennoscandia
after the last glacial maximum. Based on an analysis of
autosomal microsatellite markers, Fennoscandian populations are highly differentiated from each other perhaps
due to founder effects following postglacial colonization
[25]. Our study demonstrated that the level of genetic
differentiation between the X and Y chromosomes was
much larger than the interpopulation differentiation in
the respective chromosomes. Because the patterns of
allelic differentiation between the X and Y chromosomes
were consistent in all populations, it is obvious that the
sex chromosomes had been highly differentiated prior to
the postglacial recolonization of Fennoscandia.
The usefulness of homologous microsatellite markers
in X and Y chromosomes for the inferences of population history and sex-specific genetic structuring has
been proposed in human studies [40,42-44]. Our results
showed that the level of genetic variability in the X
chromosome was lower in northern Fennoscandian
populations as compared to those from central and
southern Fennoscandia. This is consistent with a previous study that found a northward reduction in genetic
variability at autosomal microsatellite loci [25]. In contrast, the level of genetic variability in the Y chromosome was consistently low in all populations. Similarly,
mitochondrial DNA analyses revealed that one haplotype is widely distributed throughout the populations in

Page 5 of 6

the study area, suggesting that these populations share a
common ancestry [25]. Hence, the low genetic variability of the paternal lineage supports the conclusion
obtained from the maternal lineage. Further studies with
more markers for the paternal lineage will be necessary
to better evaluate this point, as well as to address sexspecific processes shaping population structure.

Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated that the microsatellite locus Stn19 shows sex-specific allelic differences in a
large number of Fennoscandian nine-spined stickleback
populations. Thus, this marker can be used for the sex
identification of immature individuals, as well as adults
when visual criteria are deemed to be unreliable. The
consistent patterns of allelic differentiation between
these chromosomes across the populations suggest that
the sex chromosomes of nine-spined sticklebacks had
been highly differentiated prior to the postglacial recolonization of Fennoscandia.
