Abstract
Background: Stable isotope probing (SIP) technique was developed to link function, structure and activity of microbial
cultures metabolizing carbon and nitrogen containing substrates to synthesize their biomass. Currently, available
methods are restricted solely to the estimation of fully saturated heavy stable isotope incorporation and convenient
methods with sufficient accuracy are still missing. However in order to track carbon fluxes in microbial communities
new methods are required that allow the calculation of partial incorporation into biomolecules.
Results: In this study, we use the characteristics of the so-called 'half decimal place rule' (HDPR) in order to accurately
calculate the partial13C incorporation in peptides from enzymatic digested proteins. Due to the clade-crossing
universality of proteins within bacteria, any available high-resolution mass spectrometry generated dataset consisting
of tryptically-digested peptides can be used as reference.
We used a freely available peptide mass dataset from Mycobacterium tuberculosis consisting of 315,579 entries. From
this the error of estimated versus known heavy stable isotope incorporation from an increasing number of randomly
drawn peptide sub-samples (100 times each; no repetition) was calculated. To acquire an estimated incorporation error
of less than 5 atom %, about 100 peptide masses were needed. Finally, for testing the general applicability of our
method, peptide masses of tryptically digested proteins from Pseudomonas putida ML2 grown on labeled substrate of
various known concentrations were used and13C isotopic incorporation was successfully predicted. An easy-to-use
script [1] was further developed to guide users through the calculation procedure for their own data series.
Conclusion: Our method is valuable for estimating13C incorporation into peptides/proteins accurately and with high
sensitivity. Generally, our method holds promise for wider applications in qualitative and especially quantitative
proteomics.

Background
An important aspect of microbial ecology is to link specific microorganisms to microbially-driven processes in
the natural environment [2]. Indeed, these questions can
be addressed with more accuracy by using isotopically
labeled substrates to follow metabolic carbon flux within
microbial cultures. Subsequently, the incorporation of the
label into the biomass may be followed by analysis of
either fatty acids [3], deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) [4] or
ribonucleic acid (RNA) [5]. Unfortunately, those techniques are limited in their ability to resolve low levels of

isotopic labeling and their absolute incorporation. Essentially, the information about low level labeling as well as
the assignment of distinct incorporation levels to various
species is needed in order to understand the metabolic
interdependencies within complex microbial communities.
To overcome the drawbacks of other calculation methods, we recently developed a new protein-based stable
isotope probing (Protein-SIP) technique [6]. A brief overview of the workflow is displayed in Figure 1. In short,
the incorporation of stable e.g.13C and/or15N isotopes
from a substrate was used to pinpoint the metabolically
active species within a consortium. Different species
incorporate different degrees of the stable isotopes into
their biomass according to their physiological ability and

Figure 1 Schematic overview about the workflow of analysis. (A) Assimilation of heavy stable isotopes into the biomass of various species depends on the turnover and the interaction activity of the species. The incorporation of stable13C isotopes from a substrate can be used to pinpoint
the metabolically active species within a consortium. The different incorporations are indicated by various amounts of label (gray-color scale). (B) After
cell harvesting and protein extraction, samples were tryptically digested and analyzed by MS. The isotopologues shifted to a higher mass range due
to their incorporation of heavy labeled carbon into the proteins. A higher level of incorporation indicates a faster growth rate and/or a primary role in
the degradation of the labeled substrate within the food web. (C) The incorporation of heavy stable isotopes into peptides/proteins can be estimated
using the HDPR. (D) Peptides can be used to obtain phylogenetic information (in case of unique peptides), for structural analysis, and for physiological
information about the actual state of the microbial cells. (E) Based on this information, C-fluxes and food web structures can be elucidated and may
further help to reconstruct the interaction of microbial communities.

their activity (Figure 1A), which can be detected on peptide/protein level [7]. After cell harvesting and protein
extraction, samples were analyzed by various proteomic
and mass-spectrometry techniques. Due to the isotopic
abundance of13C and/or15N, several isotopic envelopes
can be detected by high-resolution mass spectrometry
(MS) [8,9]. As expected, the isotopologues shifted to a
higher mass range due to the incorporation of heavy
labeled carbon into the proteins, as shown in the MSspectrum in figure 1B. The12C-containing peptides are
shown at the left hand side of each spectrum. A higher
level of incorporation, as shown in the right spectra of
part B, indicates a faster growth rate and/or an increased
substrate usage of the carbon source of species. In order
to assign these activities to different species, two steps
have to be applied (i) the light peptides have to be identified by Tandem-MS (mass spectroscopy) and further
assigned to the bacterial taxon and (ii) the heavy stable
isotope incorporation has to be determined.
One method of calculation is to compare12C and13C
isotopologue distributions in one MS-spectrum and
estimate13C incorporation by calculating the mass difference between the monoisotopic12C mass peak and the
highest mass peak of the13C isotopologue. This procedure depends on a proper pre-fractionation, since the
corresponding mass peaks can be rather difficult to identify. Alternative calculation methods are necessary to find
the matching pairs at low incorporation levels [10].
Therefore, an improved method based on the comparison of theoretical and experimentally determined isotopic envelopes of peptides with known sequences was
developed [11,12]. However, both methods require a priori peptide identification to accurate determine the
dynamic labeling of heavy stable isotopes. In order to reliable quantify partial13C incorporation into peptides, we
developed a method based on the "half decimal place
rule" (HDPR) (Figure 1C). Information about the
dynamic incorporation levels in proteins from different
microbial species can be used to elucidate the structure
and function of the microbial community (Figure 1D).
With this information, the carbon fluxes throughout the
community may be followed and enables to deduce species interactions and activities (Figure 1E) [13,14].
In this study, we describe a new and easy-to-apply algorithm for the determination of absolute heavy stable isotope incorporation (13C) into peptides/proteins by taking
advantage of high-resolution MS data [15,16], and the
characteristic pattern arising from the decimal residuals
of incorporated heavy stable carbon isotopes [17]. Annotated sequence information for measured peptides is no
longer necessary for the calculation of13C incorporation
that is an important consideration when analyzing uncultivable or incompletely sequenced bacteria. Moreover, we

provide an easy-to-apply script set written in the statistical programming language R [18], enabling scientific
researchers to calculate13C incorporation into peptides/
proteins.
Theoretical background

In the past, mass spectrometers suffered from their low
resolution and accuracy, restricting the possibility to predict chemical element contents based on the mass signals. Higher accuracy allows to create exact fitting curves
describing the behavior of a mass signal as a function of
both the mass and the e.g. sulfur content [19]. With upcoming of high resolution MS devices, a linear relationship between tryptic peptide masses and the decimal
residuals (=digits behind the mass' decimal point) has
been firstly observed by Mann [20] (for additional references see [19,21]). Closer investigation of this mass mapping phenomenon by Schmidt et al. [17], led to the
definition of the linear relationship of tryptic peptides
and the corresponding decimal places, the so-called "half
decimal place rule" (HDRP).
This rule declares that the decimal place of a tryptic
peptide is near the half of the first digit for tryptic peptides in the range of 500-1,000 Dalton (Da), near the half
of the first two digits for the range of 1,000-1,999 Da and
again near the half of the first digit for masses from 2,0003,000 Da. The rule was found to be helpful for e.g. the
detection of non-peptide contaminants in mass spectrometric measurements and the recalibration of peptide
masses [17]. Since only the digits behind the decimal
point are necessary as information in order to identify
some artifacts of tryptic peptides.
During the metabolic incorporation of13C amino acid
precursors into proteins,13C atoms are gradually
replaced12C atoms. This elemental substitution increases
each peptide mass by exactly 1.003355 Da (= the difference between12C and13C atomic mass) per substituted
carbon atom. In terms of decimal places for peptides,
each incorporated heavy carbon atom result in a mass
shift of exactly 0.003355 Da. Applying the HDRP to partly
or fully labeled peptides, the linear relationship between
peptide masses and their decimal places will result in an
increase of the corresponding slope. The steepness of the
slope increases in proportion with the amount of incorporated heavy stable isotopes. This effect can be used for
the exact estimation of the amount of incorporation for
any given set of measured peptide masses. The detection
of these small mass shifts, however, requires highly accurate measurements. This is now possible with modern
mass spectrometers such as a fourier transformation ion
cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR), linear ion trap with an
Orbitrap (LTQ-Orbitrap) or quadruple time-of-flight (QTOF) instrument.

sequences (0 atomic %13C incorporation), (B) fully labeled (100 atomic

Therefore, we developed a semi-automatic and more
flexible approach. Each point cloud was separated by a
standard classification method using k-means clustering.
Prior to clustering, we transformed the original mass values in relation to their decimal residual values by the following equation,
PMTrans = PM − 1800 ⋅ D R

(1)

where PM Trans = transposed peptide masses, PM = peptide masses, and DR = decimal residuals producing a plot
as given in Figure 3. The value of 1,800 within the formula (1) was iteratively estimated. Gradually increase of
this value made the bands steeper until reaching a maximal vertical position at a value of about 1,800. A value
greater than 1,800 made the bands tilt towards the opposite direction. The following classification was conducted

1.0

Direct plotting of peptide masses against their decimal
residuals would result in regular, diagonal linear shaped
patterns (Figure 2). With increasing peptide masses, also
their decimal residuals increase until they approach values close to 1. With further increasing, the decimal residuals start with values of 0 again. In order to obtain a
continuous plot, the points of the second band had to be
added on top of the first, and those of the third band on
top of the second etc. by subsequently adding 0, 1, 2, etc
Dalton to the residuals of each band.
However, due to slight deviations from linearity caused
by the amino acid residues, an overlap of the bands
occurs (indicated by vertical lines in Figure 2A), disabling
a direct distinct and straightforward separation. Moreover, increasing substitution of peptides with heavy
stable13C isotopes does not only result in an alteration of
the slope becoming steeper, but also produces a continuous and gradual shift of the band along the m/z axis.

Since proteogenic amino acids are universal within all
bacterial species, any high-resolution dataset can be used
for referencing the theoretical decimal place calculation
(as reference data and for calibration). An existing tryptic
peptide dataset of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv
was used [22] that originally contained ~4,000 encoding
genes of which 3,924 were identified as proteins [23]. The
complete FASTA protein dataset is freely available from
the Sanger Institute [24]. After a tryptic in-silico digest by
MS-Digest [25], peptides between the mass range m/z
300-6,000 were considered for further analysis, resulting
in 315,579 peptide fragment sequences. Further, we
restricted the dataset to include only those tryptic peptides with a ChemScore ≥ 10 (ChemScore = sum of total
free protein binding energy (for further details see [2628]) and without missing cleavage sites or modifications.
After this screening, the dataset was reduced to 90,637
remaining peptide sequences containing lengths between
2 and 40 amino acids. The monoisotopic mass of each
sequence was calculated with given atomic masses of12C
= 12.000000 Da,14N = 14.003074 Da,16O = 15.994915
Da,1H = 1.007825 Da,32S = 31.972071 Da to obtain the
masses of 'light' (0 atom %13C incorporation) amino
acids. Subsequently, by counting the numbers of carbons
for each sequence and replacing the12C mass for the
heavier13C (13.003355 Da), a dataset for the theoretical
100 atom %13C incorporation was obtained. The advantage of calculating the weight by counting C atom numbers is that the same procedure can be used to easily
calculate a wide range of different13C incorporation levels.

using the Hartigan and Wong algorithm for k-means
clustering [29] with three (0; 2,000; 4,000 Da) and four (0;
1,600; 3,200; 4,800 Da) pre-set clustering centers for the
'light' (no13C incorporation) and 'heavy' (complete13C
substitution) dataset. For the clustering, pre-set center
mass values do not have to be overly accurate since the
precise numbers are automatically determined during the
clustering procedure from actual group means [30].
Finally, the original peptide masses were taken and
ranked according to cluster affiliation of the corresponding transformed mass values. In a next step, 0 Da was
added to the peptide mass values belonging to the first
cluster, 1 Da was added to the values of the second cluster
and so on. Plotting these new mass values versus their
decimal residuals resulted in the final straight plot (Figure 4).
Data plotting and linear slope estimation

Following this principle for peptide masses relating to 0
atom % and 100 atom %13C incorporation, two uniformly
increasing point clouds with dissimilar slopes were produced (Figure 4). For both datasets, a fit on a linear
model given by DR = b*PM with b equal to the slope value
and an intercept of zero was carried out. The slope value
b was estimated by adjusting the slope and minimizing
the error sum of squares (SSE) of the decimal residual
deviations:

with DR = decimal residual, PM = peptide mass, and n =

100 atom %13C incorporation were estimated with an
accuracy of 6 decimal digits and served as references for
partial13C incorporation calculation.
All methods described above are summarized as easyto-follow R-scripts which can be run under the statistical
platform R [18]. 'Script 1' enables calculation of own reference dataset for 0% atom and 100% atom13C from any
other protein mass dataset while reference slope calculation of can be done with help of 'Script 2'. Both scripts
can be downloaded under [1].
Calculation of13C incorporation from practical mass
spectrometric measurements

In order to estimate13C incorporation from experimentally derived datasets, processing occurred as described
above. However, k-means clustering with very small datasets sometimes failed, because the algorithm required
that at least one data point in each cluster to be present.
In order to circumvent this difficulty, a set of dummy data
containing one data point with values at the exact centers
were added. Prior to13C incorporation calculation, those
dummy points are removed again and, thus, have no
influence on the following calculation.
In a second step, a linear fitting was conducted. While
the standard linear fit by minimizing SSE is sufficient for
large datasets, it is not feasible for smaller datasets like
many user data consisting of relatively few peptide
masses. Moreover, these data are often irregularly distributed and can contain outliers with extreme values characterized by strong deviations from linearity. In such cases,
standard linear fitting is neither appropriate nor robust.
Moreover, commonly applied SSE-based methods rely on
the assumption that data residuals are normally distributed that, within user data is rarely found in practice.
With datasets containing high variability and/or outliers,
classical linear approximation methods often perform
poorly [32,33]. Therefore, we applied the more accurate
and robust linear fitting algorithm (rlm) provided by the
MASS package [30] in R that are better suited for small
and highly variable datasets.
The rlm fitting approximation is using an iterative process examining which points cause strong shifts in the

We developed an easy-to-use R script for the estimation of13C atom % incorporation for user datasets which
can be downloaded under [1] as 'script 3'.
User data have to be provided as an ASCII .txt file. The
file should have the values of the peptide masses containing one peptide mass (z = 1 after deconvolution) per line
with no header and/or row names. Measurements can be
provided with comma or point decimal markers.
During the run of the script, a window opens and the
user has to indicate where the ASCII.txt file is located.
The file should have the values of the peptide masses containing one peptide mass (z = 1 after deconvolution) per
line with no header and/or row names. After selecting the
file, the calculation starts immediately and results in a
scatter-plot with lines displaying the 0 atom % and 100
atom % incorporation reference lines, the user's peptide
masses, the fitting line of the data with the standard error
as quality proxy, and the estimated incorporation including the standard error estimation (Figure 5). In a loop
process, the estimation of multiple measurement campaigns can be carried out.
Accuracy of the method

In order to determine the minimal number of needed
peptide masses with an estimated incorporation accuracy
of less than 5%, we additionally calculated an in silico
peptide dataset with 50 atom % isotope incorporation of
M. tuberculosis. We sub-sampled then the two already
existing 0 and 100 atom, and the newly created 50%13C
datasets by randomly drawing groups of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50,
60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 200, 300, 500, and 1,000 theoretical
peptides across all peptide lengths with no repetition for
100 replications. For each within-group sub-sample, we
calculated the median and the standard error of each subgroup. A resulting box-and-whisker plot for each drawing

General applicability of the method

The general applicability of our method was tested using
a dataset from Pseudomonas putida ML2 growing on
fully labeled13C-benzene (0.6 mM) until the stationary
growth phase. The detailed experimental conditions are
explained by Jehmlich et al., [6]. After protein extraction,
peptides were analyzed by nano-LC-LTQ Orbitrap-MS.
From these dataset, information form 150 trypticallydigested peptide masses were taken and the heavy stable
isotopes incorporation was estimated.

Results and Discussion
Data processing

For the calibration of the unlabeled and completely
labeled incorporation, a dataset of M. tuberculosis containing atomic masses of > 90,000 peptide fragments were
used. Plotting unlabeled peptide masses directly against
their decimal residuals. As a result, up to m/z values of
~2,000 a first point cloud increased linearly with corresponding decimal residuals approaching values close to 1
(Figure 2A). When the decimal residuals reaching 1, the
next residual digits start to fill up and thus start at 0
again. Therefore, increases across values of 1 leads to the
development of the next point cloud with values close to
0. For m/z ranges between 300 and 5,000, new point

dastic characteristics. The initially compact plot becomes
more dispersed at higher peptide masses, with higher
inclination from the ideal linearity. However, peptide
masses have increased variance; (ii) since the used database also contains short-chained amino acid sequences,
the point clouds also become less dense with increasing

clouds begin. Especially, for fully labeled peptide masses,
these breaks occur at slightly lower values of ~1,800 Da,
~3,200 Da, and ~4,800 Da, since overall slopes of scatter
plots here become slightly steeper (Figure 2B). However,
variations in the molecular composition of each theoretical peptide mass impeded a simple separation into groups
in order to create a continuous linear plot. Therefore,
transient transformation using formula (1) was required.
During the transformation process, peptide masses with
small residual values (i.e. those close to 0) are comparatively altered very little, while those with big values (close
to 1) experience strong shifts towards the ordinate and
thus result in the expected increase of slope steepness for
each group (Figures 3A and 3B). Subsequent to transformation with formula (1), allows straightforward separation of the point clouds for both the unlabeled and the
fully labeled dataset, and the clustering algorithm was
able to separate all data points into distinct classes. Misgrouping occasionally occurred with higher peptide
masses, where points become more dispersed within the
group. However, misgrouping occurred only in less than
0.1% of all data points.
After separation into groups, and the addition of 0, 1, 2
and 3 Da according to the group affiliation of each data
point, two separated linear point clusters with distinctive
slopes were obtained (Figure 4). Two characteristics can

estimated as b0% = 5.1357e-4 and for the fully labeled dataset b100% = 6.3347e-4. These two values were used in further calculations as our standards for the 0 atomic % and
100 atomic % incorporation.
By applying formula (4), we were able to calcuate
incomplete heavy stable isotope incorporation into peptides of user data. However, standard linear fitting
depending on minimizing SSE turned out to be strongly
influenced by outliers. Strong deviation of the expected
slope caused by outliers occurred most frequently in scenarios with inhomogeneous distribution of the measurements along the m/z range. In the presence of outliers,
especially with high values, traditional methods are inefficient and biased because the least squares predictions
are often heavily dragged towards these outliers. While
every added point in the traditional SSE method has a
direct influence on the slope, SSE has a breakdown point
value of 0 and signifying that every added point has the
same influences on the slope value. Our recommended
robust linear model algorithm has a breakdown point
value of 0.5, meaning that at least 50% of the data need to
be altered to cause the slope estimation to change. Thus,
when peptide masses with high mass strongly deviated
from the linear reference slope, the final slope completely
affected by these values. Using the robust linear fitting
(rlm) algorithm, the slope for the calculation can only
altered if more than 50% of all used data points varied.
Therefore, the rlm algorithm is more robust and stable if
outliers are used in the dataset.
Accuracy of method

The accuracy of incorporation is strongly depends on the
considered number of peptide masses. As expected, the
accuracy was very poor with small datasets (when using
only 10-30 peptide masses). The prediction accuracy was
only < 25% at known 0, 50, and 100 atom %13C incorporation (Figure 6). However, after including more than 50
peptides, the prediction asymptotically approached less
than 10% precision. After incorporation of about 100
peptide masses, the accuracy became better than 5%.
However, the inclusion of more peptide masses (> 200)
did not improve the accuracy further.

General applicability of the method

The method can be applied to a broad range of bacterial
taxa. Data from other bacteria than the M. tuberculosis
reference strain proved also to be very successful. In
order to validate the method, we used peptides of the
bacterium P. putida ML2 grown on fully labeled substrate
in a batch culture. Obtained mass spectra were analyzed
by a LTQ-Orbitrap and the incorporation of13C into the
peptides was calculated applying our method. After data
points fitting a graph with a slope of 6.2910e-4 was generated that corresponds to 97.3% ± 0.3%13C incorporation.
This value of13C incorporation is quite comparable with
other MS-based methods where the labeling efficiency
was estimated as 98.6% ± 0.2% for13C labeled peptides
[35]. However, in comparison of our algorithm with other
MS-based methods, generally for the latter a much higher
effort for estimating incorporation values is needed.

Conclusion
We demonstrated that our method can be used to estimate the13C incorporation into peptides/proteins accurately and sensitively. The method requires about 100
peptide masses in order to achieve an accuracy of less
than 5%.
Generally, our method holds promise for wider applications in qualitative and quantitative proteomics. Comprehensive proteomic analyses of mixed communities would
enable microbial ecologist to link community composition, physiology, function, ecology, interaction, and evolutionary processes [36]. Metaproteome analyses were
performed by either gel-based [37] or by LC-MS based
approaches [38] and would go one-step further with the
combination of metabolic labeling and proteome analysis
(Protein-SIP) by obtaining the metabolic activity of various species in microbial communities.
