gene sets in the genus Neisseria: insights
gained from the genome of Neisseria
lactamica isolate 020-06

Abstract
Background: The genus Neisseria contains two important yet very different pathogens, N. meningitidis and
N. gonorrhoeae, in addition to non-pathogenic species, of which N. lactamica is the best characterized. Genomic
comparisons of these three bacteria will provide insights into the mechanisms and evolution of pathogenesis in
this group of organisms, which are applicable to understanding these processes more generally.
Results: Non-pathogenic N. lactamica exhibits very similar population structure and levels of diversity to the
meningococcus, whilst gonococci are essentially recent descendents of a single clone. All three species share a
common core gene set estimated to comprise around 1190 CDSs, corresponding to about 60% of the genome.
However, some of the nucleotide sequence diversity within this core genome is particular to each group,
indicating that cross-species recombination is rare in this shared core gene set. Other than the meningococcal cps
region, which encodes the polysaccharide capsule, relatively few members of the large accessory gene pool are
exclusive to one species group, and cross-species recombination within this accessory genome is frequent.
Conclusion: The three Neisseria species groups represent coherent biological and genetic groupings which appear
to be maintained by low rates of inter-species horizontal genetic exchange within the core genome. There is
extensive evidence for exchange among positively selected genes and the accessory genome and some evidence
of hitch-hiking of housekeeping genes with other loci. It is not possible to define a ‘pathogenome’ for this group
of organisms and the disease causing phenotypes are therefore likely to be complex, polygenic, and different
among the various disease-associated phenotypes observed.

Background
Comparison of the genomes of related bacteria that
exhibit distinct pathogenic phenotypes can identify the
genetic traits required for invasion and elucidate key
steps in the evolution of virulence. The genus Neisseria,
which comprises Gram negative oxidase positive diplococci that colonise the mucosa of humans and animals,
provides an excellent model for this type of study as it
includes species that are never or rarely pathogenic and
two human pathogens of global significance, Neisseria

meningitidis (the meningococcus) and Neisseria
gonorrhoeae (the gonococcus) [1]. Neisseria lactamica is
closely related to the pathogenic Neisseria [2,3] and, like
them, is only ever isolated from humans; consequently,
a number of studies have been undertaken to compare
the non-pathogen N. lactamica with meningococci and
gonococci in the hope of identifying key genetic determinants of meningococcal or gonococcal disease [4-13].
Phenotypically, the gonococcus is the most divergent
of the three organisms as it colonises the urogenital
tract and can be considered to be an obligate pathogen
of the mucosal surface that occasionally causes disseminated infection [14]. The meningococcus and N. lactamica are more similar in their life histories: both are

obligate commensal inhabitants of the human nasopharynx that establish long-term normally asymptomatic
colonisation. Carriage of N. lactamica is high in infants
and young children and declines as the age of the
human host population rises. The converse is true for
the meningococcus, the carriage prevalence of which is
low in infants and young children but rises with host
age, generally reaching its highest in adolescents and
young adults [15,16]. Unlike N. lactamica, which is only
anecdotally associated with invasive disease [17-19], the
meningococcus can be a dangerous pathogen occasionally invading the nasal mucosa to cause septicaemia and
meningitis [20]. Although devastating for the patient,
neither of these syndromes is of any benefit to the
meningococcus itself as they do not normally lead to
onward transmission of the bacterium, which is therefore best categorised as an ‘accidental pathogen’ [21].
Nonetheless, meningococcal disease is a global phenomenon which, in some settings, occurs in large outbreaks
[22]. The idea that the colonisation of children with
N. lactamica plays a role in the development of immunity to the meningococcus [23-25] has further stimulated comparative investigations of these two organisms
and anti-meningococcal vaccines based N. lactamica
have been proposed at various times [26,27].
The meningococcus, gonococcus, and N. lactamica
are closely related at the genetic level [2] and appear to
have recently descended from the same ancestral population. Multilocus studies have indicated that these are
maintained as separate populations by the absence or
low frequency of genetic exchange among them,
although rates of recombination within each of the
microbiological species groups are high [3] and some
genetic sequences are shared among species groups.
The low genetic diversity observed at seven housekeeping genes of the gonococcus is consistent with this
organism having evolved from a single clone that changed niche from the nasopharyngeal to the urogenital
tract [28]. N. lactamica and meningococcal populations,
on the other hand, are more diverse and both populations consists of a number of clonal complexes, each
comprising related genotypes [29,30]. In the case of the
meningococcus, some of these, the so-called hyperinvasive lineages, are particularly associated with invasive
disease [31]. Knowledge of the population structures of
these organisms has been used to design studies of the
genetic elements that are involved in virulence
[4,8,13,32], but to date a pathogenic genotype has yet to
be determined and it seems probable that the invasive
phenotype of the hyperinvasive genotypes is complex
and polygenic. Here we examine the genealogical relationships among the three species, describe the determination and annotation of the first complete genome
sequence of N. lactamica (isolate 020-06) and discuss

the insights that this provides into the evolution of the
pathogenic Neisseria.

Methods
Genealogical relationships among species

Relationships among N. meningitidis, N. lactamica and
N. gonorrhoeae were investigated by an analysis of
nucleotide sequences from 19 housekeeping gene loci.
The loci included were those used for Neisseria MLST
(abcZ, adk, aroE, fumC, gdh, pdhC, and pgm) [29,33]
supplemented with 12 additional loci (aspA, carB, dhpS,
glnA, gpm, pilA, pip, ppk, pykA, rpiA, serC, talA) with
alleles generated as described previously [34]. The
analysis included data from 52 N. lactamica isolates,
comprising 46 unique seven locus sequence types (STs)
sampled from a population of 271 isolates used to analyse diversity in N. lactamica [30], 20 isolates representing 20 unique STs (one ST from each clonal complex
and two STs not belonging to clonal complexes) from
the 107 N. meningitidis isolates originally used to define
MLST [29], and subsequently analysed at additional loci
[34], and seven complete Neisseria genomes downloaded
from publicly available databases. These genomes
include: meningococcal isolates Z2491 (serogroup A,
ST-4 complex) [35], MC58 (serogroup B, ST-32 complex) [36], FAM18 (serogroup C, ST-11 complex) [37],
053442 (serogroup C, ST-4821 complex) [38], a14 [13],
and gonococcal isolates FA1090 (The University of
Oklahoma, U.S.A), and NCCP11945 [39]. All isolates
used (Additional file 1) have been deposited in the Neisseria PubMLST database: http://pubmlst.org/neisseria/,
which is searchable by publication record.
Genealogies were constructed with CLONALFRAME
version 1.1 [34,40] using 50000 burn-in iterations and
50000 Monte-Carlo Markov Chain iterations. The
results from eight runs were combined to achieve maximum robustness and the 75% consensus tree was
viewed using MEGA version 4.0 [41]. To add support to
the species-specific clustering, neighbour-joining trees
were drawn from the same data using MEGA version
4.0 and Split Decomposition was carried out using SplitsTree version 4.10 [42]. MEGA version 4.0 was used to
determine p distances.
Determination of the complete genome sequence of N.
lactamica 020-06

The genome was sequenced to an approximately 10-fold
shotgun sequence, totaling 42232 end sequences, from
pUC19 (with insert sizes of 1.4-2 kb; 2-2.8 kb and 3-3.3 kb
respectively. 2.8-3.3 kb), and pMAQ1Sac_BstXI (with
insert sizes of 5.5 kb-6; 9-10 and 10-12 kb respectively)
genomic shotgun libraries using big-dye terminator chemistry on ABI3730 automated sequencers. End sequences
from large insert BAC libraries in pBACe3.6_BamHI with

Bennett et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:652
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/652

an insert size 15-18 kb were used as a scaffold. This generated an approximate 1-fold coverage from 4670 end
sequences). All repeat regions and gaps were bridged by
read-pairs or end-sequenced polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) products again sequenced with big dye terminator
chemistry on ABI3730 capillary sequencers. The sequence
was manipulated to the ‘Finished’ standard [43].
Annotation and genome comparison

An automatic gene prediction program (Glimmer3) [44]
was used to identify coding regions. Putative orthologues were identified by reciprocal-best-match FASTA
searches between N. lactamica 020-06 and meningococcal strain FAM18 amino acid sequences with cut-offs of
80% sequence length and 30% identity. The complete
genome was annotated manually using the genome
viewer Artemis [45]. The N. lactamica genome sequence
was compared to genomes from N. meningitidis (Z2491,
MC58, FAM18, 053442 and a14) and N. gonorrhoeae
(FA1090, NCCP11945) using the Artemis comparison
tool (ACT) [46]. The Dot plot figure was generated
using MUMmer version 3.22 [47] and indicates matching sequences, with codirectional and reversed regions
of synteny shown in red and blue, respectively. The figure is a plot for multiple query sequences (other Neisseria) and one reference sequence (N. lactamica) where
each reference/query comparison gives its dotplot.
The genome sequences were aligned to start/finish at
the origin of replication. The comparative analysis of the
core gene dataset was carried out using an in-house
pipeline of all-against-all best reciprocal FASTA
searches that outputs the respective percentage (pairwise) identity. The analysis and annotation of repeat
families in N. lactamica, was carried out implementing
a hidden Markov model based methodology, as previously described [37].

Results and Discussion
Genealogical relationships of N. lactamica, N. meningitidis,
and N. gonorrheoae

The nucleotide sequences of 19 housekeeping genes
from 52 N. lactamica, 25 meningococcal and two gonococcal isolates were used to generate a genealogy with
the CLONALFRAME algorithm [40]. ClonalFrame uses
a statistical algorithm that infers clonal relationships
while taking into account the effect of homologous
recombination. This algorithm clustered the isolates into
three groups, each corresponding to one of the microbiological species (Figure 1). These groups were also evident from other clustering algorithms, including
neighbour joining trees and split decomposition (Additional file 2). Neighbour joining trees for each of the
individual loci mostly replicated the same groups with
some inconsistencies (Additional files 3, 4 and 5); for

example, the genealogy for the dhps locus did not
show species-specific clustering for N. meningitidis and
N. lactamica, which might suggest horizontal genetic
exchange between species. As dhps encodes dihydropteroate synthase, and sulphonamide resistance is
mediated by altered forms of this enzyme [48], positive
selection may promote recombination at this locus.
However, no dhps alleles were shared among the three
species.
The nucleotide sequence diversity for the 19 loci
among the species groups as assessed by pairwise
p-distances was similar, ranging from a p-distance of
0.053 between the meningococci and the gonococci to a
p-distance of 0.073 between N. lactamica and N. meningitidis. The diversity within each of the groups, measured by the same means, was also similar among the
N. lactamica isolates (average p-distance of 0.026) and
the meningococcal isolates (average p-distance of 0.032)
and appreciably lower between the two gonococcal isolates (p-distance of 0.06). These data support the conclusions reached from seven-locus multilocus sequence
typing (MLST) and multilocus enzyme electrophoresis
studies that the three microbiological species represent
valid functional and taxonomic groups [3,28] notwithstanding their close genetic similarity [2], which is consistent with recent divergence.
For the isolates included in this analysis, the number
of fixed nucleotide differences greatly exceeded the
number of shared polymorphisms in comparisons
between the gonococci and meningococci (147 fixed differences, 33 shared polymorphisms) and the gonococci
and N. lactamica isolates (316 fixed differences, 11
shared polymorphisms). This contrasted with comparisons of the meningococcal and N. lactamica isolates,
where the number of fixed differences (118) was much
smaller than the number of shared polymorphisms
(435). Taken together these data indicate that all three
species groups share an ancestral population, with
the gonococcus likely to be descended from a single
member of that population. N. gonorrhoeae does not
exchange genetic material with other Neisseria frequently but, unlike other pathogens that have emerged
by a similar process [49,50], genetic material is regularly
exchanged among gonococci such that their populations
do not have a clonal structure [51,52]. Present day
meningococcal and N. lactamica populations, on the
other hand, have diverged from the ancestral population
without undergoing a severe bottleneck and now represent distinct species groups, with the nucleotide
sequence diversity in their housekeeping genes exhibiting extensive shared ancestry.
In the current analysis there were only two cases of
alleles shared among the different species groups, both
at the pykA locus. The pykA-7 allele was present in 5

Figure 1 Genealogical relationships of Neisseria isolates inferred from 19 loci. CLONALFRAME trees were drawn from the sequences from
19 housekeeping gene fragments from 79 isolates. These include the eight complete Neisseria genomes, 20 isolates representing 20 unique
seven locus STs (one ST from each clonal complex and two STs not belonging to clonal complexes) from the meningococcal collection used to
validate the MLST scheme [29], and 51 N. lactamica isolates, comprising 46 unique seven locus STs sampled from a population used to analyse
diversity in N. lactamica [30]. N. lactamica clonal complexes are circled. N. lactamica (Nla) = red, N. meningitidis (Nme) = blue, N. gonorrhoeae
(Ngo) = green.

meningococcal isolates and one N. lactamica isolate and
the pyKA-24 allele was present in one meningococcal
isolate and one N. lactamica isolate. In the N. lactamica
020-06 genome this locus is immediately adjacent to an
orthologue of gene NMB0088 in the meningococcal MC
58 genome, which encodes a putative immunogenic
outer membrane protein orthologous to the FadL potential vaccine component of Escherichia coli [53]. This
observation complements previously published evidence
for the hitch-hiking of housekeeping alleles with antigen
alleles promoting genetic exchange among meningococci
and N. lactamica [54], although such hybrids as do
occasionally arise appear to be less fit and are purged by

purifying selection [55]. In conclusion, while genetic
exchange between meningococci and N. lactamica has
been reported for a number of genes under positive
selection [55,56], the two groups remain distinct as a
result of limited genetic exchange among housekeeping
genes [3], which is consistent with the species status of
these organisms. Frequent horizontal genetic exchange
among groups would prevent speciation, or if it occurs
after the speciation event, would lead to a ‘despeciation’
process, as has been proposed recently for the gastric
pathogens Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli
[57]. There is no convincing evidence of such a process
occurring among the Neisseria.

As with meningococci, N. lactamica isolates are currently assigned to clonal complexes on the basis of their
seven locus sequence types [30]http://neisseria.org/nm/
typing/mlst/. These clonal complexes comprise a central
genotype ST and STs that share identical alleles for at
least four of the seven MLST loci in the central genotype. At the time of writing, six N. lactamica clonal
complexes had been identified, each named after the
central genotype of the complex (the ST-595, ST-613,
ST-624, ST-640, ST-1494 and ST-1540 clonal complexes), five of which were represented in the genealogical analysis reported here. Members of the same clonal
complexes were consistently clustered together in the 19
locus genealogy, indicating the general robustness of the
assignment of clonal complexes on the basis of seven
loci. The genealogy did, however, suggest that some of
the genealogical groups were larger than the currently
defined clonal complexes and also indicated the existence of several other clonal complexes, currently represented by one or a few sequence types (Figure 1). The
star phylogeny of N. lactamica is redolent of that of the
meningococcus [34] and consistent with both species
exhibiting a clonal complex population structure, comprising groups of related isolates that cannot be genealogically linked to each other as a consequence of high
rates of intra-species horizontal genetic exchange
[33,34,58].
On the basis of these analyses there was no a priori
reason to choose a member of one particular clonal
complex over any other for genome sequencing,
although it was considered desirable to choose a recent
bacterial isolate that had not been maintained in the
laboratory for long periods of time and one that represented a common and widespread genotype. For these
reasons, isolate 020-06, obtained from a six-week-old
child from the UK in 1997 was chosen as the most
appropriate candidate for genome sequencing. This isolate has ST-640, the central genotype of a clonal complex from which members have been isolated in the UK

[30] and four other countries (unpublished data). The
MLST profiles for these isolates can be viewed at:
http://pubmlst.org/neisseria/[59].

Comparison of the genome sequence of N.
lactamica isolate 020-06 with other Neisseria
genomes
General features and gene order

The complete genome sequence of isolate 020-06 was
determined by capillary-based whole-genome shotgun
with standard finishing procedures. It has been deposited in GenBank with the accession number FN995097.
The genome comprised a circular chromosome of
2,217,455 bp in length, with a GC content of 52.27%.
These features were very similar to those of the published meningococcal and gonococcal genomes which
ranged from 2,145,295 bp to 2,272,351 bp in length,
with a GC contents ranging from 51.53% - 52.68%. The
numbers and distribution of DNA uptake sequences
(DUS, 2244), Correia elements (138), and dRS3 repeats
(297) were broadly similar to those seen in the other
published Neisseria genome sequences and have been
used to suggest that genetic exchange represents a conservative rather than diversifying force in the Neisseria
[60]. The number of predicted coding sequences (CDSs)
identified in the genome of 020-06, at 2018, was also
similar to the number identified in the other genomes,
which ranged between 1976 and 2662 CDSs, although
this number is not necessarily directly comparable
owing to differences in the annotations of the published
and unpublished genome sequences [13,35-39] (Table 1).
In addition, a plasmid of 3,151 bp in length was present,
similar to N. lactamica plasmid pNL18.2 [61]. Plasmids
are relatively common in N. lactamica and the gonococcus, although rarely seen in meningococci [61].
Whole genome comparisons of gene order showed
that, with the exception of an inversion of 404215 bp
around the terminus of genome replication, the genome
sequence of N. lactamica 020-06 was essentially

co-linear with that of meningococcal isolate Z2491 (Figure
2A). The larger inversion was also evident in comparisons
of the N. lactamica genome with the genome sequences of
the remaining meningococcal genomes examined, those of
isolates MC58, FAM18, a14, and 053442, one of the two
gonococcal isolates, NCCP11945, but not the genome of
isolate FA1090. Other than these changes in gene order,
all of which maintained features such as GC skew (Additional file 6), there were no consistent changes in co-linearity among any of the Neisseria genomes examined
(Figure 2B). Although the total number of completely
assembled genomes available remains small, these comparisons suggest that there is a consensus genome order,
described previously for N. meningitidis [37], for all three
Neisseria species examined here. This is essentially the
gene order seen in meningococcal isolates Z2491, a14,
053442, and FAM18. Most of the large-scale departures
from this consensus are present in only one meningococcal genome examined so far and may be particular to that
isolate alone or that isolate and its close relatives. Such
rearrangements, frequently observed in bacteria [62] may
well be biologically neutral or artifacts of growth in the
disease state [63] or pure culture. One exception to this
was the large rearrangement around the terminus that is
present in the N. lactamica isolate and one gonococcal
isolate (FA1090). The very close relationship of all gonococci (Figure 1), suggests that this inversion may have
occurred more than once in the history of the genus, but
more genome data are required to definitively answer this
question. There is consequently no evidence to suggest
that gross genome rearrangements have played a role in
the emergence of pathogenicity in the Neisseria as there is
no consistent pattern of genomic rearrangements among
non-pathogenic and pathogenic Neisseria, as have been
observed in some other groups containing bacterial pathogens [64], although a role of such rearrangements in the
emergence of clonal complexes cannot be excluded on the
basis of information currently available.
Gene content and core genome

Of the 2018 N. lactamica CDSs identified, 1447 (72%)
were assigned to functional categories. Of the remaining
CDSs, 421 (21%) were not assignable to a known function and 150 (7%) were categorized as conserved
hypothetical proteins. Comparisons with the genomes of
N. meningitidis Z2491, MC58, FAM18, 053442, a14,
and N. gonorrhoeae genomes FA1090 and NCCP11945
showed a similar distribution of functions (Figure 3).
Changes in gene content among the different genome
sequences were confined to CDSs classified as involved
in transport and metabolism. These were relatively overrepresented among those CDSs present in other Neisseria, but absent in N. lactamica. They were also
underrepresented among those only present in the

Page 6 of 14

N. lactamica genome. CDSs of unknown function were
overrepresented in the N. lactamica genome and underrepresented in the core genome. A total of 1190 (59%)
of the N. lactamica CDSs were present in all the seven
completed genomes available at the time of writing
(Table 1) and these can be regarded as an estimate of
the core genome for these three species (Additional file
7). This may actually be an underestimate of the core
genome as this dataset was automatically produced and
not manually curated. Therefore mis-annotations in any
of the genomes would mean that the genes involved
might automatically be excluded. The core genome of
N. meningitidis alone has been estimated to consist of
1706 genes when the genomes of Z2491, MC58 and
FAM18 were examined [8] and approximately 1300
genes when seven meningococcal genomes were examined [65]. The latter estimate is very similar to the core
genome proposed for the three species here and, given
that the number of core genes in purely meningococcal
comparisons is likely to reduce as more genomes
become available, suggests that the core genome,
amounting to some 60% of the total genome, is common to all three species.
The draft genomes sequences of eight human Neisseria commensal species have been compared to eleven
previously sequenced Neisseria genomes [66] and a
Neisseria core genome of 896 genes was defined, consisting mainly of housekeeping genes. This analysis,
however included Neisseria elongata, which is more distantly related to the meningococcus than the other Neisseria commensals analysed, and is an unusual member
of the genus in that it is rod-shaped, in contrast to
other Neisseria spp. which are diplococcic. This species
also shares fewer core genes with the pathogenic species
than the other commensals. Further studies, involving
more commensal genomes will help define further the
core Neisseria genome and may also alter the species
definitions of organisms currently defined as Neisseria.
For the core genome defined here CDSs ranged from
36.4% to 100% amino acid identity. However, 1180 of
these CDSs had greater than 70% amino acid identity
among all the genomes examined. The ten CDSs that
had less than 70% amino acid identity to the corresponding CDSs in isolate Z2491 included seven that
were classified as transport/membrane proteins; one
unknown protein; a 3-oxoacyl-(acyl carrier protein)
synthase II protein; and putative ribonuclease BN. However, the lower identity was not consistent across the
genomes. For example, the transferrin-binding protein B
(TbpB) in Z2491 was greater than 70% identical to the
corresponding proteins in the other genomes except for
the genomes of the two serogroup C meningococci
(FAM18 and 053442). Whereas the TbpB in isolate
053442 was 67.3% identical to the Z2491 TbpB, the

FAM18 TbpB was only 41.7% identical. Previous work
has determined that there are two tbpB isotypes, with
isotype 1 solely identified among N. meningitidis isolates
belonging to the ST-11 clonal complex [67], of which
isolate FAM18 is a member. The CDS encoding the
porin protein PorB also showed differing degrees of
identity among the genomes, with the FAM18 porin
having the least identity to Z2491 (61.8%). The PorB
proteins are known to be diverse [68] with the FAM18
porin belonging to class PorB2 and the Z2491 porin
belonging to class PorB3.
Pair-wise comparisons of the 1190 core CDS
sequences from meningococcal isolate a14 against each
of the remaining genomes generated a profile of relatedness that was concordant with the microbiological
species groups (Figure 4). All five meningococcal isolates were identical at 72 loci, with many of these loci
encoding ribosomal proteins (Additional file 7). By
contrast, a total of 30 N. lactamica 020-06 and 29
gonococcal FA1090 CDSs were identical with their
orthologues in Z2491. As the threshold of identity was

lowered, these relationships were retained, with all four
meningococcal genomes showing close relationships to
the genome of isolate Z2491 and the N. lactamica and
gonococcal genomes showing lower numbers of CDSs
at each level of sequence identity, with all genomes
converging at >70% identity for 1180 CDSs. These relationships were consistent with the CLONALFRAME
genealogy obtained from the 19 locus analysis (Figure
1) and provided no support for the idea that the acapsulate ST-53 meningococcal isolate a14 was more closely related to N. lactamica and N. gonorrhoeae than
the encapsulated meningococci [13,65]. Therefore,
although 60% of the CDSs present in a given Neisseria
genome appear to be common to all three species, and
there is a high level of shared ancestry among meningococci and N. lactamica, the core genomes of each
species are characterized by particular sequence poylmorphisms. Again, this is consistent with the results of
the 19 locus analysis and provided more evidence for
lack of frequent inter-species genetic exchange among
the core genomes of these organisms.

The accessory genome

The remaining 40% of the N. lactamica 020-06 genome
represents the ‘accessory genome’ made up of elements
that are not present in all Neisseria isolates. Comparisons with the seven available complete genomes
revealed very few genes that were unique to N. lactamica, although this list is likely to change as data accumulates from more genomes. These included the lacZ
and lacY genes, which confer the lactose fermenting
phenotype after which the bacterium is named, and
which replace a haemolysin found in meningococci and
gonococci [7]. The low GC content of these genes suggests that they may have been acquired from an unrelated oropharyngeal bacterium. Other genes unique to
N. lactamica, which may have been horizontally
acquired after speciation, include four genes putatively
involved in phosphorylcholine biogenesis (licA, licB, licC
and licD), which may have been acquired by horizontal
exchange from Haemophilus influenzae [69]; slpA,
which encodes a putative AAA+ATPase, and slpB,
which encodes a putative subtilisin-like protease; two
low GC content genes that are present in a small number of N. lactamica strains and one Neisseria sicca
strain [11]; and several genes that encode putative adhesins (Table 2).
There were several genes not present in meningococci
and gonococci which may have been lost by these
organisms on speciation, including those encoding: a

putative toxin-antitoxin system (RelEB) [70] and seven
CDSs encoding hypothetical proteins not found in the
pathogenic Neisseria upstream of these loci; a putative
TonB-dependant receptor that is also present in a number of other Neisseria species (Neisseria cinerea
ATCC14685, Neisseria sicca ATCC29256, Neisseria subflava NJ9703, Neisseria flavescens NRL30031, Neisseria
mucosa ATCC25996 sequenced at the Genome Sequencing Center at the University of Washington and
available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The N. lactamica genome appears to have two different copies of
genes encoding putative L-lactate permeases. One
(NLA16970), encodes an L-lactate permease similar to
those found in N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis and
the other (NLA5610) is present only in N. lactamica
020-06 and other genomes of commensal Neisseria
(N. lactamica ATCC 23970, N. cinerea ATCC14685,
N. sicca ATCC29256 , N. mucosa ATCC25996, sequenced
at The Genome Sequencing Center, University of
Washington). Downstream of NLA5610 are genes that
encode two putative TonB dependant receptors: NLA5590
which is present in pathogenic and commensal Neisseria,
and NLA5600, which has only been found in N. lactamica
020-06 and commensals sequenced at The Genome
Sequencing Center, University of Washington (N. lactamica N. cinerea, N. sicca, N. mucosa, N. subflava, and N.
flavescens). These two genes may have been deleted from
the meningococcal and gonococcal genomes, as the GC

content of these sequences in N. lactamica 020-06 did not
suggest horizontal genetic exchange.
Although N. lactamica is distinct from N. gonorrhoeae,
there are some similarities between the two species. The
most obvious is the lack of capsule in both N. lactamica
and N. gonorrhoeae. In addition, the putative toxin-antitoxin system FitAB is present in N. lactamica and N.
gonorrhoeae but not N. meningitidis. A gonococcal
mutant that lacks fitAB grows normally extracellularly,
but has an accelerated rate of intracellular replication
with a concomitant increase in the rate at which this
mutant traverses a monolayer of polarized epithelial cells
[71]. As N. meningitidis lacks both FitA and FitB, intracellular replication and intracellular trafficking may be
greater in meningococci. NLA13470 and NLA13480
(putatively azlC and azlD respectively) are also present in
N. gonorrhoeae. In N. meningitidis, azlC is truncated and
azlD is not present, suggesting this region has been disrupted in N. meningitidis. A list of genes present in
meningococcal genomes Z2491, MC58, FAM18, and the
gonococcal genome FA1090, but absent from N. lactamica 020-06 is included in Additional file 8.
Out of a total of 134 candidate meningococcal virulence genes proposed previously, 115 (86%) have been
shown to be present in the genomes of three meningococcal isolates from asymptomatic carriage (a14, capsule
null; a153, serogroup 29E; and a275, serogroup W-135)
[13]. A total of 78 (58%) of these genes were present in
the N. lactamica 020-06 genome (Additional file 9). The
remaining 56 ‘N. meningitidis specific’ genes were not
found in all meningococcal genomes and some were
present as putative pseudogenes [13]. Functional genes
found in all the meningococcal genomes analysed to
date but not found in N. lactamica 020-06 included:
lgtA, opcB, porA, fetB2, frpA, frpC, iga1, sodC, gna1870,
natC and nlp; however, gna1870 appeared to be present
in other N. lactamica isolates (our unpublished data)
and many of the other genes may yet be found in
N. lactamica isolates that have not been sequenced.
There is an iga2 gene present in N. lactamica
(NLA19200); however, this gene has a ~708 bp insertion
relative to the iga2 gene in the pathogenic Neisseria and

bears no resemblance to the gene that encodes the IgA
protease, which is implicated in pathogenesis.
These analyses confirm that the majority of the accessory genome is shared among all three Neisseria species,
probably by horizontal genetic exchange, and that a
‘pathogenome’ of accessory genes, which explains differences in the pathogenic phenotypes among these organisms cannot readily be defined. Some of the shared
CDSs have previously been described as ‘putative virulence genes’ but these are better thought of as genes
that confer fitness benefits to transmission only in certain circumstances or genetic backgrounds and which
affect the probability of causing invasive disease only
incidentally [13]; indeed, many of these genes have now
been identified in the complete genome of N. lactamica
020-06 and other N. lactamica isolates [7]. As meningococcal-specific sequences are thought to represent only
about 5% of the genome of N. meningitidis [72], differences in virulence among isolates and species is likely to
be due to subtle changes in their genetic organisation
and in their alleles, making the determination of what
constitutes a pathogenic phenotype complex for these
organisms. This observation is consistent with the conclusions of a previous micro-array-based study, which
suggested that a complex integrated network of genes,
regulation and diversity of function in common genes
could be responsible for the behavioural differences
among N. lactamica, N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae. Consequently, for these organisms it is not possible to attribute the emergence of an invasive
phenotype to a single event, a single gene set, or loss or
gain of a single function [7].

Conclusion
Comparisons of the genome of N. lactamica 020-06
with those of the meningococcus and gonococcus provide further detail as to how three closely related biological species, each with distinct genetic and phenotypic
characteristics have emerged from a single ancestral
population [28]. All three have retained very similar
genomes in terms of overall composition, size, and
architecture, suggesting that this divergence is relatively

Bennett et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:652
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/652

recent. The most likely scenario for the emergence of
the gonococcus remains the invasion of a single clone
into a novel niche, the urogenital tract. This argument
is strengthened by the presence of porA, gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (ggt) and opc pseudogenes in
N. gonorrhoeae genomes [73-75]. Speciation of N. lactamica and N. meningitidis has followed a different path,
with the two populations diverging without a bottleneck
event, therefore retaining substantial shared ancestral
diversity. It has been proposed that the species
N. meningitidis emerged at the same time that meningococcal disease was first described in 1806 [13,76], but
this is highly conjectural as commensal meningococci
are likely to have been in existence for many thousands
of years. It is unclear how gene flow between these
groups was disrupted sufficiently for the emergence of
distinct species [77], but perhaps this was a consequence
of specialisation in the colonisation of different host age
groups. There is little evidence of frequent genetic
exchange among the present day populations except for
genes under positive selection, mostly those encoding
variable antigens [54,56]. Occasionally housekeeping
alleles adjacent to genes under positive selection are
exchanged as a consequence of hitchhiking [54], but
overall the species groups are coherent. The observed
infrequent inter-species genetic exchange among housekeeping genes is supported by an estimate of the average
size of an imported genetic fragment which is 1100 bp
[78], larger than the average gene length in the meningococcal genome (852 bp) [35]. If inter-species genetic
exchange was frequent among housekeeping genes, gene
replacements and therefore the sharing of alleles among
species would be common. This clearly is not the case
here and proving that horizontal exchange has occurred
can be difficult as it requires more evidence than shared
polymorphisms alone, which may have been inherited
vertically from the ancestral population.
Recombination has erased any phylogenetic signal
within each of these species groups at most housekeeping loci. For the single clone origin gonococcus, relatively little variation has accumulated in housekeeping
genes but that which has, has been extensively reassorted. In meningococci and N. lactamica, extensive
genetic diversity, much of it inherited from the common
ancestral gene pool, is organised into clonal complexes,
each associated with particular alleles at each of the
housekeeping gene loci analysed to date. Unlike the
polymorphisms, these alleles appear to post-date speciation. The core genome is very similar in terms of orthologous genes among all three species and estimates of
the three species and meningococcal core genome of
~1200 and ~1300 [65] CDSs respectively, are also very
similar. This suggests that there are few differences in
the core genomes of these three species and few core

Page 11 of 14

genes are limited to just one species group. This is also
true of the accessory genome, the majority of which is
shared among the three species. Genetic variation is not,
however, evenly distributed among all three species,
with the core genomes exhibiting distinct polymorphisms (Figure 4). Thus it appears that sequence variation
in housekeeping genes, notwithstanding appreciable
shared history, is particular to each species. This may be
due to coherence imposed by recombination, or it may
represent co-evolution within the housekeeping genes of
each species group, which could help to maintain distinct groups if hybrids that contain sequence diversity of
more than one group are less fit for host-to-host
transmission.
There has been a consistent temptation to map an
evolutionary path from the acapsulate Neisseria species,
including N. lactamica and the gonococcus, via capsule
null (cnl) meningococci to capsulate and therefore invasive meningococci [13]; however, there is no genealogical support for this view (Figure 1) and phylogenetic
trees presented as providing evidence have been misinterpreted in that the position of a cnl meningococcus
marginally closer to a long branch leading to N. lactamica and gonococci does not provide strong evidence
for this process [13]. It is also the case that members of
characteristically cnl meningococcal clonal complexes
[79], such as the ST-53 complex which is represented in
this analysis by the complete genome of isolate a14, can
acquire a capsule and cause invasive disease. Indeed, the
first representative of the ST-53 complex to be isolated
was a serogroup C-expressing meningococcus from a
case of invasive disease [80]. The data are, therefore,
more consistent with the capsule region genes spreading
though the meningococcal population post speciation by
an infectious genetic exchange process, which has not
reached fixation [81,82]. Thus the cnl is the ancestral
state of the meningococcal population but meningococci
with the cnl do not represent ancestors of present day
capsulate meningococci.
The search for a ‘pathogenome’ for the pathogenic
Neisseria remains frustratingly, perhaps permanently,
incomplete. Unlike the enteric bacteria, where transferable genetic elements that encode virulence factors
(’pathogenicity associated islands’, PAIs), are associated
with particular strains that cause given disease syndromes [83], the genetics of pathogenicity in the Neisseria is more complex, with pathogenicity-associated
genes distributed throughout the genome. Meningococcal population diversity is structured into clonal complexes, some of which, the hyperinvasive lineages, are
more likely to cause invasive disease than others [22].
The capsule is the primary virulence determinant, but
whilst this is necessary it is not sufficient to cause disease [84]. Other virulence determinants, such as the

Bennett et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:652
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/652

MDA phage [32] and haemoglobin receptor (HmbR)
[85] are widely and unpredictably distributed among
meningococci and non-pathogenic Neisseria, indicating
the hyperinvasive phenotype is probably encoded by different genetic elements in different meningococcal
lineages. If, as has been recently suggested, clonal complex structure in the meningococcus, and by extension
in N. lactamica, is a consequence of the selection of
genetic types that are suited to particular micro-niches
[86], then the increased probability of invasion will be
generated in different lineages by different combinations
of genetic traits. If this is indeed the case, then the
genetic basis of the meningococcal hyperinvasive phenotype will only become evident by the exploitation of parallel sequencing technologies [87] in whole-genome
analyses of large collections of Neisseria isolates that are
representative of diverse genotypes and phenotypes [88].
