Abstract
Background: Cichlid fishes are notorious for their wealth of intra- and interspecific colour
pattern diversity. In Lake Tanganyika, the endemic genus Tropheus represents the most impressive
example for geographic variation in the pattern and hue of integument colouration, but the
taxonomy of the over 100 mostly allopatric colour morphs remains to a large degree unresolved.
Previous studies of mitochondrial DNA sequence data revealed polyphyly of the six nominally
described species and complex phylogeographic patterns influenced by lake level fluctuations and
population admixture, and suggested the parallel evolution of similar colour patterns in divergent
evolutionary lineages. A gene tree of a rapidly radiating group may be subject to incomplete and
stochastic lineage sorting, and to overcome this problem we used multi-locus, nuclear AFLP data
in comparison with mtDNA sequences to study diversification, migration and introgression in
Tropheus colour morphs in Lake Tanganyika.
Results: Significant incongruence between phylogenetic reconstructions from mitochondrial and
AFLP data suggested incomplete sorting of mitochondrial haplotypes as well as frequent
introgression between differentiated lineages. In contrast to the mitochondrial phylogeny, the AFLP
phenogram was largely congruent with species classifications, colour pattern similarities, and in
many cases also with the current geographic distribution of populations, and did not produce
evidence of convergent colour pattern evolution. Homoplasy in the AFLP data was used to identify
populations that were strongly affected by introgression.
Conclusion: Different evolutionary processes were distinguished by the combination of
mitochondrial and AFLP data. Mitochondrial phylogeographic patterns retained signals of largescale migration events triggered by historical, major lake level fluctuations, whereas AFLP data
indicated genetic cohesion among local groups of populations resulting from secondary contact of
adjacent populations in the course of the more frequently occurring, minor lake level fluctuations.
There was no support for the parallel evolution of similar colour patterns in the AFLP data. Genetic
signatures of introgression and hybridisation detected in several populations suggest that lake level
fluctuations drove the stunning diversification of Tropheus morphs not only through population
fragmentation, but also by promoting hybridisation between differentiated morphs in secondary
contact.

Background
Incongruence among gene trees is a widespread phenomenon in phylogenetic studies of recently and rapidly radiating species [1-7]. Mitochondrial DNA markers have
several evolutionary properties that make them suitable
for phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies, but inferences within and between closely related species can be
misled by introgression and incomplete lineage sorting
[2,8-10]. In recent years, the amplified fragment length
polymorphism technique (AFLP, [11]) has found application in evolutionary studies to resolve phylogenies both at
the intraspecific population level as well as between several million year old lineages [12-16]. In cichlids and
other rapidly diversifying taxa, where speciation events
often precede fixation of alleles within a species (e.g. [9]),
the combined analysis of numerous AFLP markers
recently has been shown to overcome the problems of
incomplete sorting of alleles between speciation events
[12,17-21].
The tribe Tropheini comprises a highly diverse assemblage
of cichlid fishes endemic to Lake Tanganyika that radiated
from a riverine ancestor and evolved into the most abundant group in the rocky littoral zone [22,23]. As a sister
group to the Tropheini, the remaining "modern haplochromines" (sensu [23]) also originated in Lake Tanganyika and later dispersed through the rivers of eastern
Africa to colonise the younger lake basins of Lakes Malawi
and Victoria [23]. The genus Tropheus represents the most
impressive example for the phenomenon of geographic
variation in body colour pattern in Lake Tanganyika's
cichlid species, and over 100 mostly allopatric colour variants are recognised [24,25]. Due to their diversity, Tropheus represent a promising system for studies of colour
pattern evolution, and for the same reason, specimens of
the genus have become extremely popular among
aquarists. So far, six nominal species have been described
based on morphological characters (T. moorii BOULENGER, 1898; T. annectens BOULENGER, 1900; T. duboisi
MARLIER, 1959; T. brichardi NELISSEN and THYS VAN
DEN AUDENAERDE, 1975; T. kasabae NELISSEN, 1977
and T. polli AXELROD, 1977; [26]). However, there are no
scientific data on the distribution of the species around
the lake, and many Tropheus populations from different
regions of the lake cannot be unequivocally identified to
species [26]. Due to the uncertainties in the species-level
taxonomy of the genus and the high level of colour pattern diversity on small geographic scales, populations are
generally identified by their locality rather than by species
(e.g. [27]), and this practice is also adopted in the present
work. The popularity of Tropheus recently prompted
attempts to improve the taxonomic coverage of the genus,
which were presented in the popular literature but have
not been validated by scientific studies. For example, in
addition to the scientifically described nominal species,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/137

Konings [24] suggested five taxa (T. sp. "black", T. sp.
"red", T. sp. "Ikola", T. sp. "Mpimbwe") and proposed
assignments of populations to the different species based
on phenotypic traits such as body shape and coloration.
Schupke [25] described more than 100 Tropheus populations and arranged them into 13 colour lineages.
The evolution and phylogeographic history of the genus
was investigated in four studies that were based on mitochondrial sequence data and revealed highly complex patterns of lineage distribution [27-30]. One concurrent
finding of these studies was the paraphyletic status of the
genus, as T. duboisi represents a distinct unit, which is not
in a sister group relationship to the remaining species of
the genus Tropheus. Sturmbauer et al. [27] defined 12
mitochondrial lineages based on a phylogenetic reconstruction using a parsimony method implemented in TCS
[31], which have evolved in the course of two major radiations about 700–945 Ka and 399–540 Ka. Both diversification events could be correlated to extreme changes of
lake level, and a lowstand of Lake Tanganyika in the recent
past (11–17 Ka; [32]) might have shaped the present distribution of lineages.
Lake level fluctuations displace benthic populations and
entail cycles of population admixture and isolation, and
indeed, several Tropheus populations comprise a mixture
of different mitochondrial lineages, indicating introgression during secondary admixis of formerly differentiated
populations. Mitochondrial haplotype sharing across
opposite shorelines further testifies that lineages were able
to cross the lake along the ridges between the lake basins
during periods of low lake level [27]. Despite the historically unstable population distribution along the shore,
Tropheus populations display high levels of genetic structure across very short geographic distances in both mitochondrial and nuclear markers ([33] and unpublished
data). Gradual among-population differences in colour
pattern generally increase with geographic distance
between populations, and major habitat barriers (like
sandy bays) often separate phenotypically highly distinct
morphs (see Fig. 1 for a map of Lake Tanganyika and Tropheus colour morphs). However, populations displaying
similar colour patterns are not always closely related in
terms of mtDNA phylogenetic reconstructions, which suggests introgression among lineages and convergent evolution of colour patterns in the genus. Only recently,
hybridisation has been proposed as an important factor
for the generation of diversity in animals [7], and recent
phylogenetic studies showed that introgression has
occurred between distinct lineages within the cichlid species flocks and even might have given rise to hybrid speciation in some cases [6,18,34-36]. Some of the colour
pattern diversity in Tropheus may well be due to the introgression events indicated by mitochondrial data.

To overcome the limitations of phylogenetic inference
from a single gene, both AFLP and mtDNA sequence data
were collected from Tropheus populations around Lake
Tanganyika. Mitochondrial and nuclear-multilocus tree
reconstructions were tested for consistency, and hypotheses based on previous mtDNA studies, such as introgression patterns and convergent evolution of certain colour
patterns, were evaluated with respect to the AFLP data. The
different information provided by the two marker systems
was used to address different processes affecting the evolutionary history and current phylogeography, such as
large-scale migration and hybridisation between colour
morphs. Due to the uncertainty of species-level taxonomy
in Tropheus, we apply Harrison's [37] definition of hybridisation as "the interbreeding of individuals from two populations, or groups of populations, which are
distinguishable on the basis of one or more heritable characters". Finally, the molecular data were compared to current species assignments and to the suggested
classifications of Konings [24] and Schupke [25].

Results
Mitochondrial sequence relationships
The 117 samples included in this study represent 9 of the
12 previously defined mitochondrial lineages based on
parsimony network clusters reconstructed in the program
TCS (Fig. 2; [27]). The topologies of the trees derived by
Bayesian inference (Fig. 2, 117 samples) and a NJ analysis
(117 samples; [see Additional file 1]) were consistent with
the NJ topology inferred in a comprehensive analysis of
462 Tropheus samples [27]. Differences between tree
topologies concern nodes with little support from posterior probability and bootstrap values. Fifty-nine of the
samples presented here were not included in the dataset
of Sturmbauer et al. [27] and a description of their positions in the phylogenetic reconstructions is presented as
supplementary information [see Additional file 2].

As previously observed (e.g. [27,28]), the mitochondrial
phylogenetic reconstruction of Tropheus populations was
in several instances inconsistent with the geographic distribution of populations on the one hand and with colour
pattern similarities among populations on the other
hand. Figure 2 shows that there is little agreement
between mitochondrial sequence relationships and suggested species assignments [24] and colour lineage classifications [25].
AFLP genotype clusters
AFLP data were obtained with ten primer combinations
and consisted of 914 fragments (146 constant, 687 parsimony informative and 81 parsimony-uninformative
sites). The resulting tree topology was markedly different
from the mtDNA-based reconstruction. ShimodeiraHasegawa [38] LRT found the difference of 904 likelihood

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/137

units between mtDNA and AFLP topologies to be significant (P < 0.05).
Unlike the mitochondrial sequence phylogeny, the AFLP
phenogram revealed clusters of phenotypically and, in
part, geographically close populations (Fig. 1, Fig. 3). Four
major clades could be identified: The basal clade (AFLP 1)
comprised a heterogeneous group of samples from geographically quite distant localities, whose populations
have been assigned to T. brichardi (northern basin:
Nyanza Lac, Bulombora, Kabimba and Halembe, southern basin: Ulwile Island, Namansi and Nvuna Island).
Clade AFLP 2 contained T. polli sampled from Ikola at the
eastern shore of the central basin as well as T. "Kongole"
from Kavala Island at the southwestern shoreline of the
northern basin, which phenotypically closely resemble T.
polli. Clade AFLP 3 comprised the colour morphs displaying a dark body colour with a conspicuous yellow or red
band or with blotches – e.g. the popular T. "Kaiser" and
"Kirschfleck" – as well as the newly described morph "red
belly" from Mabilibili with a less contrast rich colour pattern. Within this clade, the populations from Kiriza,
Mboko, Bemba and Rutunga in the north, and from Ikola
and the Kungwe mountain range in the east were grouped
in two sister sub-clades consistent with their geographic
distribution. Finally, clade AFLP 4 unites the T. moorii
populations from the southern basin of the lake with Tropheus from Mpimbwe splitting at the base. Within AFLP 4,
the T. moorii populations were grouped according to their
geographic range and phenotypic conformity (Fig. 1), but
statistical support for these subclades was weak. In more
detail, the red-coloured morphs from Chisanze to Livua
grouped together in one subclade. The colour morphs
with a yellow blotch on their body side (Kasakalawe to
Kala) were grouped as a subclade sister to the colour
morphs displaying a bluish body colour (Katukula to
Chaitika). The population in Katoto is apparently an
admixture of both morphs [33]. "Yellowish" morphs
from Lufubu, Kabeyeye and Inangu were placed in the
"bluish" subclade, whereas the yellow Ilangi morph was
resolved as sister group to the clade that unites "bluish"
and "yellow-blotch" morphs with more "red-brownish"
populations from Wapembe and Namansi and from
Kalya further north.
Samples from the same population always belonged to
the same major AFLP clade even when they were not
grouped next to each other, whereas they were often distributed across several mtDNA lineages. Suggested species
assignments [24] and colour lineage classifications [25]
by and large agreed with AFLP clades (Fig. 3; see Discussion).

Signals of introgression and hybridisation: AFLP homoplasy
excess test and mitochondrial relationships
Hybrid genotypes contain AFLP-fragments from both
parental clades, which appear as homoplasies and reduce
bootstrap support for the parental clades [7]. Hence,
removal of hybrid taxa from the phylogenetic analysis will
increase bootstrap values for the parental clades significantly beyond any changes in bootstrap support induced
by removal of any other non-hybrid taxa. Such changes in
bootstrap support caused by the removal of any random
clades could, for example, be due to retained ancestral
polymorphism in the data set. The procedure of removing
various different clades from the analysis therefore serves
to distinguish signals of hybridization from signals of
ancestral polymorphism. Note that ancestral polymorphism, introgression involving several clades as well as
homoplastic mutations will prevent bootstrap support
values for a parental clade from reaching 100% even when
the hybrid taxon is removed from the data set. Furthermore, it is theoretically possible that a "hybrid" signal in
the AFLP data is solely due to retained ancestral polymorphism, when drift was much weaker in some populations
than in others.

We removed each of the 51 population samples at a time,
and calculated bootstrap support for 15 nodes in the
taxon reduced data set. Additionally, in two instances, several populations were removed at once (samples of the
four yellow coloured morphs from Ilangi, Inangu, Kabeyeye and Lufubu; and samples of T. polli from Ikola North
together with T. "Kongole" from Kavala Island). The
homoplasy tests identified a number of potentially introgressed populations, which is in line with the interpretation of the published mtDNA based phylogeographic data
claiming that very few populations experienced longer
periods of independent evolutionary history. This made
reconstruction of possible hybrid parents very difficult in
most cases, as parental populations of hybrid taxa were
probably often themselves affected by introgression. Figure 4 shows boxplot diagrams of the distribution of bootstrap values obtained from the 53 taxon-reduced runs for
selected examples, which were interpreted as possible
hybrid origin of or substantial introgression into the
taxon whose removal caused the significant increase in
bootstrap support of a node. See Figure 3 for positions of
the nodes mentioned in the following text. The geographic distribution, mitochondrial lineage assignment
and phenotype of the populations involved in the here
described examples of introgression is given as supplementary information [see Additional file 2].
Removal of the Tropheus "red belly" individuals resulted
in a rise of the bootstrap value at node 8a2 from 418 to
948 (Fig. 3 and 4A), which strengthens support for
nuclear genetic cohesion of this – phenotypically plausi-

ble – group. Our data suggest that the "red bellies" represent a hybrid morph with one parent in the AFLP-3 clade
– likely a T. "Kirschfleck" –, but the AFLP data failed to
pinpoint the second candidate parent clade. Removal of
the yellow coloured morphs sampled near the Lufubu
estuary (Fig. 4B) increased the bootstrap values at node 1
("bluish" + "yellow-blotched", from 154 to 666), node 1a
("bluish", from 14 to 240), node 2 (from 219 to 776) and
node 4a ("red", from 266 to 427), and slightly raised support at node 1b ("yellow-blotched", from 518 to 621).
These homoplasy signals together with mitochondrial
haplotype composition of the "yellow" morphs [see Additional file 2] suggest ancient introgression between the
"red" and "bluish" morphs. The removal of individuals
from Livua (Fig. 4C) resulted in a rise of bootstrap values
at nodes 4b ("red" morphs, from 588 to 885) and 5 (from
205 to 554), and removal of Chisanze samples from the
AFLP dataset (Fig. 4D) had strong effects on the bootstrap
values of node 4a ("red", from 266 to 453), node 4b
("red" without Livua, from 588 to 800) and node 3 (306
to 557). Both cases are suggestive of introgression
between distinct lineages. The population at Katoto,
which is located near a bay that separates "bluish"and
"yellow-blotched" morphs, has been assumed to originate
from an admixture of the two morphs, since it displays an
intermediate colour pattern and contains haplotypes from
both sides of the bay [33]. In the AFLP analysis, the
removal of the two samples from Katoto caused a slight
increase of the bootstrap value at node 1b (the "yellowblotched" clade) from 518 to 665 (Fig. 4E), which was
beyond the bootstrap value fluctuations caused by
removal of other taxa. Although the signal is weak, it is
consistent with introgression of the "yellow-blotched"
morph into the Katoto population.
There was no significant increase in bootstrap support for
nodes 5a, 8, 8a, 10 and 11 in any of the taxon-reduced
runs.

Discussion
Our results demonstrate a high degree of incongruence
between mtDNA derived and nuclear based phylogenetic
reconstructions, suggesting incomplete lineage sorting
and introgression in the course of the evolution of the
genus Tropheus. Alternatively, sex-biased dispersal behaviour could have contributed to the observed disparities.
However, congruent genetic structure was detected in
mitochondrial haplotype and nuclear microsatellite data
in a population genetic analysis (unpublished data),
which indicates that, at least on small geographic scales,
both sexes show concordant dispersal behaviour. Incomplete lineage sorting is not uncommon in the rapidly
diversifying lacustrine cichlids of East Africa, and was, for
example, demonstrated in phylogenetic studies on Lake
Victoria cichlids [39] and the Mbuna cichlids of Lake

Malawi [12,40-42]. The importance of incomplete lineage
sorting and/or hybridisation has also been discussed for
Lake Malawi non-Mbuna cichlids [43] and the Lake Tanganyika cichlid species assemblage [9,44], in particular
with respect to the tribes Eretmodini [34], Lamprologini
[6,36,45,46] and Perissodini [47]. Given the rapidity of
the mitochondrial lineage diversification in the genus Tropheus in combination with population displacements and
admixtures triggered by lake level fluctuations [27], it is
reasonable to expect signals of both incomplete lineage
sorting and introgression in the genetic data.
The phylogeographic distribution of the mitochondrial
haplotypes of Tropheus populations is highly complex.
Distribution ranges of mitochondrial lineages overlap in
several regions of the lake and distinct mtDNA lineages
often comprise populations from geographically very distant localities and with distinct phenotypes (Fig. 2; see
also [27]). Additionally, mitochondrial sequence relationships are much at odds with suggested species delineations in the scientific as well as in the aquarist literature
[24] and with a proposed classification of the genus into
lineages based on colour pattern similarities ([25]; Fig. 2).
In contrast, the phenogram based on AFLP data (Fig. 3) is
largely congruent with species classifications (e.g. T. brichardi in clade AFLP 1, T. polli in clade AFLP 2), colour pattern similarities (AFLP 3 and sub-clades in AFLP 4), and in
many cases also with the current geographic distribution
of populations (sub-clades in AFLP 3; AFLP 4 and subclades therein; Fig. 3). Besides the recently discovered "red
belly", the morphs included in clade AFLP 3 were classified as T. sp. "black" and T. sp. "ikola" (consisting of the
"Kaiser" morph from Ikola) by Konings [24], and
Schupke [25] elaborated an even more fine-scale subdivision of this clade into four colour lineages. Mitochondrial
sequences of these morphs were resolved in different lineages, and suggested convergent evolution of the conspicuous colour pattern. In contrast, the AFLP data indicate
monophyletic ancestry of the geographically disjunct, but
phenotypically similar populations around Bemba in
northern Lake Tanganyika, and along the Kungwe mountain range in the central lake basin, and furthermore signal genetic cohesion between the similarly coloured
populations within each region (see Fig. 1 and 3). The
separate taxonomic placement of the "Kaiser" morph
from Ikola outside T. sp. "black" is not supported by our
data.
Within clade AFLP 4, there was no bootstrap support for
the relationships between subclades. This lack of AFLPbased resolution may reflect a high frequency of introgression among the populations inhabiting the shallow
southern tip of Lake Tanganyika. Here, even rather minor
lake level fluctuations must have displaced littoral populations, which were forced to follow the shifting shoreline,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/137

and thus induced admixture of several previously isolated
populations. Likewise, the populations from the shallow
northern tip of the lake (samples from Kiriza, Mboko,
Bemba and Rutunga in AFLP 3) were not resolved by
locality within their clade, probably due to the same reason. Additionally, sampling sites along the southern
shoreline were more densely distributed than in other
regions, and signals of introgression between neighbouring populations were therefore picked up more readily.
Nevertheless, although significant bootstrap support is
lacking, the grouping of the southern populations within
clade AFLP 4 is consistent with the geographic distribution and the phenotypic similarities, and by and large
identifies the "red" morphs, the "bluish" morphs and the
"yellow-blotched" morphs as differentiated units with
genetic connectivity within colour morphs. Still, the distinction of T. sp. "red" from T. moorii [24] is not fully supported by our data.
In contrast to the continuous geographic distribution of
clade AFLP 4 containing the southern populations, the
three other clades have a fragmented distribution along
the lakeshore, which follows from the disjunct distributions of the species joined into these clades [24]. The processes leading to the patchy distributions of these species
remain puzzling, but may be consequences of colonisation waves following lake level fluctuations and competitive interactions between differentiated colour morphs
and species [27].
Despite the disparities between mtDNA and AFLP data,
both marker types supply valuable and complementary
phylogenetic and phylogeographic information. Whereas
AFLP data for the first time demonstrated the genetic
cohesion of some Tropheus taxa, the mitochondrial data
provided details about the colonisation history of the
genus Tropheus and revealed multiple waves of diversification and dispersal (see also [27]). For example, mitochondrial data give evidence of migration across the lake or
into distant populations on the same lakeshore, where the
introgressed mtDNA haplotypes occasionally persisted
and sometimes even drifted to high frequencies [27]. In
the multi-locus AFLP data, the signal of individual migration events was lost through recombination, whereas the
genetic continuity between neighboring populations and
the common ancestry of phenotypically discernible clades
becomes visible. Large-scale migrations are probably associated with isolated periods of severe lake level lowstands
[27]. Similarly, the gene flow between adjacent populations along a stretch of shoreline indicated by AFLP data
is likely to occur in a punctuated fashion, when occasional
drops of the lake level impose secondary contact, rather
than by ongoing dispersal, as populations have been
shown to be genetically differentiated at distances of less
than 10 km [33].

In recent studies of cichlids, hybridisation has been
advanced as an additional pathway for the generation of
novel taxa [6,7,18,35,46], and hybrids have been
observed in nature [e.g. [36,48,49]]. Usually, hybrids are
first recognised by their intermediate colour patterns or
body shape, but in the case of Tropheus, the great wealth of
intergradient colour morphs complicates a phenotypic
detection of potential hybrids. The AFLP data revealed
numerous potential cases of hybridisation and introgression between morphs, which may have given rise to novel
morphs in some instances. Positive colour-assortative
mating between highly distinct Tropheus morphs in secondary contact has recently been demonstrated in a population consisting of artificially admixed morphs, but
reproductive isolation was weak between less distinct
morphs [50], and similar results were obtained in laboratory mate choice experiments (Egger et al. unpublished
data). Under natural conditions, genetic evidence for the
admixture of morphs displaying distinct colour patterns
exists in the population of Katoto, while examples for the
maintenance of a reproductive barrier between very distinct phenotypes is found in the sympatric T. sp. "black"
and T. polli from Ikola North, and in the sympatric occurrence of "Kirschfleck"-morphs with T. polli and T. brichardi
in different regions of the lake. Hybridisation between
very distinct morphs could also have been promoted by
turbid water conditions such as in river estuaries or caused
by strong rainfalls, like it is known for Lake Victoria cichlids [48]. There is some evidence in our data that the yellow morphs near the Lufubu River estuary are strongly
influenced by high levels of introgression from the neighboring "bluish" and "red" morphs or even may have originated from hybridisation between these morphs. In
laboratory experiments, "bluish" and "red" morphs mate
assortatively (Egger et al. unpublished data), but variables
such as visibility and resource distribution may have considerable impact on mate choice in the field.

Conclusion
We conclude that the combination of mitochondrial and
AFLP data provides valuable information on different
processes affecting the evolutionary history of Tropheus.
Mitochondrial phylogeographic patterns retained signals
of large-scale migration events triggered by major lake
level fluctuations, whereas the genetic cohesion among
local groups of populations indicated by AFLP data results
from gene flow between adjacent populations brought
about by relatively frequent minor lake level fluctuations.
Introgression and hybridisation between differentiated
populations, morphs and species was evident in both
types of molecular data, and we suggest that lake level
fluctuations drove the stunning diversification of Tropheus
morphs not only through population fragmentation, but
also through hybridisation between differentiated
morphs in secondary contact.

Methods
Taxon sampling and DNA extraction
We obtained genetic data from 117 Tropheus individuals
originating from 51 localities, covering almost the entire
shoreline of Lake Tanganyika. Denser sampling along the
southern shoreline reflects the political situation in the
countries bordering the lake (see Fig. 1). Fish were either
collected in the field or purchased from ornamental fish
importers. Samples and sampling localities are given in
Figure 1 and a supplementary table [see Additional file 3].
DNA was isolated from ethanol-preserved fin-clips or
white muscle tissue using proteinase K digestion followed
by a high-salt extraction technique [51]. DNA concentration was measured using the Fluoroskan Ascent FL-System. All samples were adjusted to a concentration of 60
ng/μl.
mtDNA sequence analyses
Previous studies of mitochondrial phylogeography in Tropheus by Sturmbauer and Meyer [28], Sturmbauer et al.
[30], Baric et al. [29] and Sturmbauer et al. [27] have accumulated 5' partial control region sequence data for more
than 450 Tropheus samples. Fifty-eight of these published
sequences were used in this study [see Additional file 3],
and additional sequences from 59 individuals were
obtained as follows. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR),
purification of PCR products, and sequencing followed
the protocol described in Duftner et al. [52]. The primers
used for PCR and sequencing were L-Pro-F [53] and TDKD [54]. DNA fragments were purified with Sephadex™ G50 (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's
instruction and visualized on a 3130 × l capillary
sequencer (Applied Biosystems).

DNA sequences were aligned by eye using the Sequence
Navigator software (ver. 1.0.1 Applied Biosystems). The
alignment comprised 367 bp, with 243 constant sites, 27
parsimony-uninformative characters and 97 parsimonyinformative characters. Empirical base frequencies in this
data set were A = 0.3540, C = 0.2206, G = 0.1308, T =
0.2946. Phylogenetic relationships among the 117 samples used in the present study were estimated by a Bayesian method of phylogenetic inference using MrBayes
(ver. 3.0b4 [55]), applying the substitution model HKY,
as suggested by Modeltest (ver. 3.06 [56]), with T. duboisi
as outgroup. Posterior probabilities were obtained from a
4,000,000 generation Metropolis-coupled Markov chain
Monte Carlo simulation (ten chains; chain temperature,
0.2) with parameters estimated from the data set. Trees
were sampled every hundred generations and the first
20,000 trees were excluded as burn-in to allow likelihood
values to reach stationary. The resulting tree (Fig. 2) serves
to represent the mitochondrial structure and diversity of
Tropheus populations as resolved in Sturmbauer et al. [27].
Additionally, NJ was run in PAUP* (ver. 4.0b10, [57])

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:137

under the HKY+I+G [58] substitution model as estimated
on the data by Modeltest (invariable sites, 0.47, gamma
shape parameter, 0.90), with T. duboisi as outgroup.
Previous work [27] combined mtDNA control region
sequences of 462 Tropheus samples into a neighbour joining (NJ) tree, and classified samples into mitochondrial
lineages corresponding to unconnected networks resolved
by a phylogenetic reconstruction using a parsimony
method implemented in TCS (ver. 1.13 [31]). The phylogenetic analysis of the 117 samples included in the
present work was conducted in order to enable a comparison between AFLP data and the documented mitochondrial diversity of Tropheus, and to illustrate references to
the mtDNA phylogeography published in [27].
AFLP analysis
AFLP genotypes were obtained from the same 117 individuals as used for the mitochondrial analysis, except for
four samples from Zongwe and Livua, which had to be
replaced by alternative samples from the same locations,
because the DNA previously used for mtDNA sequencing
was of insufficient quality for AFLP genotyping. Restriction digestion of 60 ng of genomic DNA was performed in
a total volume of 50 μl using 0.5 μl MseI (10 units/μl, New
England Biolabs), 0.25 μl EcoRI (200 units/μl, New England Biolabs), 5 μl enzyme buffer (10×), 0.5 μl BSA
(100×) and high performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) water, and incubated for three hours at 37°C. For
adaptor ligation, 1 μl EcoRI-adaptor (50 pmol/μl), 1 μl
MseI-adaptor (5 pmol/μl), 1 μl T4 ligase buffer, 0.2 μl T4
DNA ligase and 6.8 μl HPLC water were added to the
product of the restriction digestion and incubated over
night at 22°C. The ligation products were subsequently
diluted to 180 μl using HPLC water. The preselective
amplifications contained 3 μl of the diluted ligation product, 0.4 μl each of EcoRI and MseI preselective primers (10
μM), 2 μl 10× MgCl2 buffer, 2 μl 10× dNTP mix (10 μM)
and 0.6 μl Taq DNA polymerase (5 units/μl, BioTherm™)
in a final volume of 20 μl. The preselective primers consisted of the adaptor primer sequence with a single selective nucleotide at the 3' end (EcoRI-pre: A, MseI-pre: C).
The preselective PCR used the following temperature profile: 2 min at 72°C followed by 20 cycles of 20 sec at
94°C, 30 sec at 56°C, and 2 min at 72°C, then a holding
step at 60°C for 30 min. PCR products were diluted 1:10
for selective amplification. For selective amplifications we
used the following ten primer combinations: EcoRI-ACA/
MseI-CAA, EcoRI-ACA/MseI-CAG, EcoRI-ACA/MseI-CAC,
EcoRI-ACA/MseI-CAT, EcoRI-ACT/MseI-CAT, EcoRI-ACT/
MseI-CAA, EcoRI-ACT/MseI-CAG, EcoRI-ACT/MseI-CAC,
EcoRI-ACG/MseI-CTG, EcoRI-ACT/MseI-CTG. The PCR
cocktail contained 1 μl of the diluted preselective PCR
product, 6.3 μl HPLC water, 0.8 μl 10× dNTP mix (10
μM), 1 μl 10× MgCl2 buffer, 0.4 μl Taq DNA polymerase

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/137

(5 units/μl; BioTherm™), 1 μl selective MseI primer (10
μM) and 1 μl selective EcoRI primer (1 μM) labeled with
the fluorescent dye FAM. The temperature profile for the
selective PCR was as follows: 2 min at 94°C followed by
10 cycles with 20 sec at 94°C, 30 sec at annealing temperature, which decreased in each cycle by 1°C from 65°C to
56°C, and 2 min at 72°C. The PCR continued for 25
cycles with 20 sec at 94°C, 30 sec at 56°C, and 2 min at
72°C, followed by a holding step at 60°C for 30 min. All
amplifications were performed on a GeneAmp PCR system 9700 (Applied Biosystems). Selective amplification
products were visualized on an ABI 3130 × l automated
sequencer (Applied Biosystems) along with an internal
size standard (GeneScan-500 ROX, Applied Biosystems).
Raw fragment data were analyzed using Genemapper (ver.
3.7, Applied Biosystems). Automated analysis with a fluorescent threshold value set to 40 units yielded 2694 fragments, but the results were compromised by the fact that
the restriction and ligation reactions had been carried out
in two batches, as ten DNA samples became available
only when the first batch of samples had already been
processed. We detected a small number of fragments that
were fixed in one batch of samples but missing from the
other, which resulted in the clustering of those individuals
that had been processed together. The second restriction
and ligation batch also contained 6 replicate samples that
had already been processed in the first set of reactions,
which allowed us to identify and exclude the artifact,
batch-specific fragments. Consequently, the dataset does
not include bands with fixed presence in one batch of
samples and fixed absence in the other batch. Furthermore, we found automated scoring problematic with
respect to fragments that show gradual intensity differences between samples, as in such cases, any detection
threshold must be arbitrary. Consequently, presence and
absence of peaks were scored by eye in the Genemapper
software within a range of 100–500 bp, and only distinct,
major fragments were considered and assembled as a
binary (1/0) matrix. In a few cases, fragments were scored
as missing data when character states could not be determined unambiguously. Manual scoring yielded a lower
number of marker bands than automated scoring, but
data quality was substantially improved by this approach.
Manually scored genotypes of replicates matched to a
level of 96%. The resulting data matrix consisted of 914
fragments in 117 samples.
The program Treecon (ver. 1.3b [59]) was used to construct a NJ tree from a pairwise distance matrix [60]. As
with mtDNA analyses, three samples of T. duboisi were
used as outgroup taxa. Bootstrap values from 1000
pseudo-replicates were calculated to assess support for the
reconstructed tree topology. There is no explicit consensus
in the literature with regard to the most appropriate tree

reconstruction method for AFLP data. With the present
data set, the use of a different distance estimator [61] for
NJ analysis and tree reconstruction by parsimony criteria
yielded the same major clades as the here presented tree.

Differences between the mtDNA and AFLP tree topologies
were statistically evaluated using the Shimodeira-Hasegawa [38] likelihood ratio test as implemented in PAUP*
(ver. 4.0b10, [57]).
Testing for homoplasy excess
A tree-based method [7] was performed to test for homoplasy excess introduced by hybridisation and introgression. Theoretically, the inclusion of a hybrid taxon into a
multi-locus phylogeny introduces homoplasy with clades
that include the hybrid parents. Removal of the hybrid
taxon should therefore decrease the amount of homoplasy in the dataset and increase bootstrap support for
clades containing hybrid parents or their descendents.
Conversely, removal of non-hybrid taxa should not affect
the bootstrap support of other nodes. One population
sample at a time was removed from the data, and bootstrap support for 15 nodes in the AFLP tree (see Fig. 3) was
computed. This procedure yielded a distribution of bootstrap values for each of the 15 nodes, which was analysed
by the method of boxplots. Values more than 3 interquartile ranges away from the box were considered significant
outliers.
