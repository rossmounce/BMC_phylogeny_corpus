Abstract
Background: YKL-40 has been implicated as a mediator of collagen synthesis and extracellular
matrix re-modeling as well as mitogenesis. Elevated serum levels of YKL-40 have been associated
with worse survival in a variety of malignancies including breast cancer. We wished to determine
if immunohistochemically detected expression had prognostic implications in breast cancer.
Methods: A prospectively collected database of breast cancer patients treated at the University
Hospital of Newark was used for analysis. Immunohistochemistry was performed on archived
tumor tissue from 109 patients for whom full clinical information and follow up was available.
Results: YKL-40 expression was noted in 37 patients (34%). YKL-40 immunoreactivity significantly
correlated with larger tumor size, poorer tumor differentiation, and a greater likelihood of being
estrogen and/or progesterone receptor negative. No significant correlation was demonstrated
between YKL-40 status and nodal stage. At a mean follow up of 3.2 years, disease-free survival was
significantly worse in the subset of patients whose tumors demonstrated YKL-40 expression
compared to the non-expressors. In multivariate analysis, YKL-40 status was independent of Tstage and N-stage in predicting disease recurrence.
Conclusion: Immunoreactivity for YKL-40 was a significant predictor of breast cancer relapse in
this subset of patients. This was independent of T or N-stage and suggests that tumor
immunohistochemistry for this protein may be a valuable prognostic marker in breast cancer.

Background
YKL-40 was first discovered as a 40 kDa protein secreted
by the MG63 human osteosarcoma cell line [1]. It was
subsequently found to belong to a family of "ChitinaseLike Proteins" (CLP), named for their structural similarity
to bacterial chitinases, although lacking their characteristic enzymatic activity. The family is notable for being

highly phylogenetically conserved, thus not surprisingly,
some of its members have been found to be fundamental
mediators of collagen synthesis and extracellular matrix
re-modeling as well as mitogenesis [2]. Although the
unique functions of YKL-40 are unknown, its putative
involvement in human disease seems to be protean. It has
been implicated as playing a role in such diverse processes

as bacterial sepsis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory
bowel disease, cirrhosis, and cancer [3-7]. Serum levels of
YKL-40 have been found to be elevated in a number of different human malignancies including those of breast,
ovarian, colon, CNS, bone, and skin origin; this finding
has invariably been associated with poor prognosis [821]. The sheer diversity of these cancers suggests that this
protein may play a fundamental role in the neoplastic
process.
Breast cancer afflicts approximately 200,000 women per
year in the United States and is the second leading cause
of cancer death in this country [22]. Traditionally, primary
tumor size and presence or absence of axillary lymph
node metastases are considered the most important factors determining prognosis. Other factors such as degree
of tumor differentiation and expression of estrogen and
progesterone receptors also have prognostic import,
although they are not usually used in clinical staging. In
the past decade, numerous studies have reported that
amplification/overexpression of the transmembrane protein kinase Her2/neu, may be associated with a more
aggressive phenotype [23]. Although controversy persists
as to this finding's true prognostic importance [24], this
issue has largely been rendered moot by the recent demonstration of therapeutic efficacy of a monoclonal antibody directed against Her2 in patients with Her2-positive
breast cancers [25-27]. The relatively new technology of
microarray analysis [28,29] may offer further insight into
new molecular prognostic markers/therapeutic targets, as
it is becoming clear that this is the next evolutionary leap
in cancer treatment. YKL-40 holds great promise in this
regard; this assertion is supported by the finding that elevated levels of this protein are associated with poor outcome in women with invasive breast cancer [11,12,14]
and ovarian cancer [15]. Heretofore, these studies have
been mainly done with ELISA of patient sera. A previous
immunohistochemical survey of breast cancer tissue demonstrated expression in over 70% of the samples, but the
clinical significance of this finding was not reported [30].
In the present study, we also wished to determine the
expression pattern of YKL-40 in breast cancer tissue, and
further ascertain whether this had prognostic implications
similar to what was found with data from patient sera.

Materials and methods
Between May 1999 and June 2006, we prospectively collected and collated data on 265 women who underwent
operative therapy for breast cancer at University Hospital
in Newark. Of these, 215 patients had invasive disease
(81%) and 50 patients (19%) had pure ductal-carcinomain-situ (DCIS). Of the patients with invasive disease, we
had full clinical follow-up, tissue availability, and YKL-40
immunohistochemical data on 109 patients. These
patients made up the cohort for the present study. Institu-

tional Review Board approval was obtained via Protocol #
0120030318.
Patient and tumor characteristics
Median age for the 109 patients in our study was 52 years.
The study group was predominantly Black (N = 65, 60%)
and Hispanic (N = 35, 32%), reflecting the nature of our
patient population. The remainder of the cohort was Caucasian (N = 7, 6%), Asian (N = 1, 1%), and Arabic (N = 1,
1%). Breast conserving surgery was performed in 51
patients (47%), while 42 had mastectomy (38%) and 16
underwent mastectomy with immediate reconstruction
(15%). Sentinel node staging was performed in 76
patients (70%). Sixteen patients were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to surgery. Most patients
(83%) were T1 or T2 with median tumor size being 2.5
cm. The majority of tumors (57%) were either poorly or
moderately differentiated (degree of tumor differentiation
was determined by Bloom-Richardson grade whenever
possible [31]). Over half the cohort (54%) presented with
node-positive disease. The median number of positive
nodes for node-positive patients was 2. The median
number of nodes harvested for patients undergoing complete axillary lymphadenectomy was 21. Sixty-seven
patients (62%) were estrogen-receptor positive by immunohistochemistry. Her2 status was documented with a
combination of immunohistochemistry and fluorescence
in-situ hybridization analysis (FISH). Tumors that were
strongly positive by immuno-staining were classified as
positive without further analysis; if the immunohistochemical results were weak or equivocal, FISH was performed. Using this algorithm, Her2 overexpression was
noted in 29 patients (27%). Patient and tumor characteristics and how they relate to YKL-40 status are summarized in Table 1. Mean follow-up was 3.0 years. Survival
was analyzed via the method of Kaplan-Meier [32]. Statistical significance was determined by chi-square analysis,
log rank testing, and the Cox regression model.
Immunohistochemistry
Representative tumor blocks were pulled and histology of
all cases was reviewed (MH). Almost all the cases were
from surgical excision specimens Immunohistochemistry
was performed as follows. A conventional peroxidase
staining technique was performed using rabbit polyclonal
YKL-40 antibody (Quidel® Corporation, Santa Clara, CA).
Briefly, the slides were deparaffinized and endogenous
peroxidase was quenched with 3% hydrogen peroxide.
Antigen retrieval was performed using Target Retrieval
Solution (DAKO Cytomation®) in a steamer for 40 minutes, and then placed into TBS (tris-buffered saline) for at
least 5 minutes. The DAKO auto-stainer was used for the
following steps: after applying 100 microliters of primary
antibody (YKL-40, at original concentration of 1 mg/ml
used at 1:160 dilution) for 15 minutes, Envision + Rabbit

kit HRP-labeled polymer (DAKO Cytomation®) was used
for the secondary antibody and incubated for 30 minutes.
The final detection was performed by using DAB as the
chromogen with hematoxylin (3%) used as the counterstain. A glioblastoma multiforme was used as positive
control (immunoreactivity is noted in the tumor
cells)[10]. For every case, a negative control without a primary antibody was used. In addition, fibroblasts and
blood vessels were used as internal negative controls. Positive staining was recognized as brown color in the cytoplasm of tumor cells.

Results
All immunohistochemical evaluation and scoring was
performed by one of the authors (MH). Evaluation was
always performed in an area of tumor where malignant
cells were the most abundant. YKL-40 immunoreactivity
was recognized as brown staining within cells, and was
localized mainly to the cytoplasm of tumor cells (Figure
1). The staining intensity was more or less equal between
the tumors and thus was not included as a scoring criterion. The number of reactive cells per specimen was variable, ranging from only a few per slide to more diffuse

staining in focal areas of the tumor. No case, however,
demonstrated immunoreactivity in all tumor cells, consistent with previous reports of expression in cancer tissues [10,30]. We arbitrarily stratified these results on a
scale of 0–2: a score of 0 denoted no detectable expression, 1 denoted "weak" expression (≤10 immunoreactive
cells/tumor), and 2 denoted "strong" expression (>10
immunoreactive cells/tumor). A score of 1 or 2 was considered a "positive" result. Using these criteria, YKL-40positive tumors were found in 37 patients (34%). Among
the positive cases, 28/37 (76%) were considered "strong"
expressors (score of 2).
We subsequently correlated the experimental findings
with the clinical characteristics of our patient cohort. No
significant difference was noted in the mean age of the
patient subset with tumors in which YKL-40 was detected
vs. the control group (52.3 years vs. 53 years, respectively). Furthermore, incidence of expression was not significantly different between invasive ductal vs lobular
cancers. In contrast, several primary tumor factors associated with poor prognosis were found to correlate significantly with YKL-40 immunoreactivity (Table 1). Mean
size of cancers in which the antigen was detected was 4.0
cm compared to 2.7 cm for those in which it was not (p <
.05). Furthermore, the incidence of YKL-40 detection
notably increased with worsening tumor differentiation
(p < .001). Nearly 70% of YKL-40-positive tumors were
poorly differentiated compared to only 18% of controls.

http://www.wjso.com/content/5/1/17

The former group was also significantly more likely to be
estrogen and progesterone receptor negative (p < .01).
Factors demonstrating no significant correlation to YKL40 status included presence or absence of axillary lymph
node metastases, nodal stage (N0 – N3), or number of
positive nodes in patients with node-positive disease.
There was also no association between YKL-40 and Her2
immunoreactivity. These findings did not change when
the weak YKL-40 expressing tumors (N = 9) were classified
as "negative."
At a mean follow up of 3.2 years (median 2.7 years, range
0.4 – 7.3 years), actuarial 5-year disease-free survival
(DFS) for the entire cohort was 66%. Factors that significantly predicted poor outcome on univariate analysis
included primary tumor size, nodal stage, and immunohistochemically detectable YKL-40 expression. Degree of
tumor differentiation was of borderline significance (p =
.05). ER, PR, and Her2 status were not predictive of disease relapse on this cohort, perhaps due to the relatively
limited follow up. For patients with YKL-40-positive
tumors, median DFS was only 3.8 years (patients with
non-expressing tumors had not yet reached median, Figure 2). Significant univariate factors associated with poor
DFS were then examined by multivariate analysis using
stepwise forward Cox regression, and demonstrated that
YKL-40 status was independent of tumor size and nodal
stage in predicting disease recurrence. Of note, although
the numbers are small, no difference in survival was noted

between patients having tumors with strong YKL-40
expression (N = 28) and those having tumors with weak
expression (N = 9).

Discussion
In our study, we found that expression of YKL-40 was
detected in about one-third of archived breast cancer tissue specimens surveyed using immunohistochemical
analysis. We noted cytoplasmic localization of the antigen
within tumor cells, a finding consistent with that reported
in a similar study of glioblastomas [10] and a previous
survey of breast cancers [30]. This seems consistent with
the fact that YKL-40 is a secreted protein and has been
detected in sera of cancer patients. Although the number
of immunoreactive cells per specimen was variable, this
tumor-to-tumor variability in YKL-40 expression was not
associated with any difference in its prognostic efficacy,
that is, cancers with only sparse expression (score 1) associated with outcome that was similar to cancers with more
diffuse expression (score 2). Our results differ somewhat
from that of Roslind et al [30] in that we found a much
smaller fraction of breast cancer specimens in which YKL40 was detected (71% vs. 34%). This difference may simply be attributable to methodological discrepancy, however, the latter figure seems to be more consistent with the
serum data in which 19–30% of breast cancer patients
were found to have elevated levels of the antigen [11,14].
Clinical correlation in our study showed that YKL-40 antigen detection was associated with larger tumor size,
poorer tumor differentiation, and a higher likelihood of
estrogen and progesterone receptor negativity. Furthermore, YKL-40 immunoreactivity was a predictor of poor

http://www.wjso.com/content/5/1/17

disease-free survival in both univariate and multivariate
analysis, being independent of both T- and N-stage. These
results are in concordance with the serum data where high
YKL-40 levels were predictive of worse outcome that also
was independent of more traditional prognostic indices
such as T and N stage [11,12,14]. There are, however,
some notable differences between the serum studies and
our results. The study by Johansen and colleagues showed
a significant correlation between high serum YKL-40 level
and node positivity, but no difference with intrinsic primary tumor factors such as size, grade (degree of differentiation), and estrogen receptor positivity [11]. Our results
were essentially contrary: we found no statistical correlation with nodal disease however, there was a high degree
of association with the above negative prognostic indices
characteristic of the primary tumor (Table 1). These findings may indicate that the serum and immunohistochemical data, although both prognostically significant in
determining outcome, may give different information.
The immunohistochemical findings may be more
strongly associated with intrinsic biology of the primary
tumor, while the serum data may be more informative of
nodal and distant metastasis [11,12,14]. Unquestionably,
these two clinical phenomena are intimately related, so it
will be useful in the future to clinically correlate the results
of combined serum and immunohistochemical data from
the same patients.
Our report does have some obvious limitations. The
cohort size is relatively small and predominantly made up
of women from ethnic minorities. The majority were
Black females, a group that some have suggested may have
an inherently worse breast cancer survivorship [33,34].
Furthermore, because of the relative immaturity of our
database, the length of follow-up was somewhat limited.
Clearly, the results will require confirmation using greater
patient numbers, longer periods of observation, as well as
a patient population that is more reflective of the entire
ethnic spectrum of women afflicted with breast cancer.
However, despite these caveats, we feel that the findings
are notable, and lay fertile ground for future studies of
YKL-40 and its role in breast cancer progression.

Conclusion
Immunoreactivity for YKL-40 was a significant predictor
of breast cancer relapse in this subset of patients. This was
independent of T or N-stage and suggests that tumor
immunohistochemistry for this protein may be a valuable
prognostic marker in breast cancer
