Abstract
An understanding of the nature of the chromosomes of the filariae is expected to greatly assist the
future interpretation of genome data. Filarial development is not eutelic, and there does not seem
to be a fixed number of cell divisions in the way that there is in Caenorhabditis. It is not clear whether
the chromosomes of the filariae have localized centromeres or whether they are holocentric. Sex
determination is by a chromosomal "balance" X0 system in most filariae, but in some
Onchocercidae there has been a chromosomal fusion to create a neo-XY system. It is presumed
that the molecular basis of sex determination in filariae is similar to Caenorhabditis. The ancestral
karyotype of the filariae is probably 5A+X0, but in some Onchocercidae this has been reduced to
4A+XY, and in O. volvulus and O. gibsoni it has been further reduced to 3A+XY. Onchocerca volvulus
and O. gibsoni both have supernumary (B-) chromosomes and in O. volvulus there is a single active
nucleolus organising region near the middle of the long autosome.

Background
Filariae and other nematodes have small genomes relative
to other multicellular eukaryotes. Onchocerca volvulus and
Wuchereria bancrofti have estimated haploid genomes of
1.5 and 0.81 × 108 nucleotide pairs respectively [1], and
this corresponds, for example, to genome sizes of 30 and
2.78 × 108 in humans and Anopheles gambiae respectively
[2]. Because of the small genome size, the chromosomes
of the filariae are correspondingly small. This makes it difficult to see their gross morphological features, which are
at the limits of resolution of the light microscope, and
consequently the cytogenetics of the Filariae have not
been well studied. However, the physical structure of the
chromosomes is a reflection of the organisation of the
DNA and its genetics. For example, the chromosomes
determine the number of linkage groups and the pattern
of sex linkage, and how this can vary between species. The
interpretation of the available nuclear genome sequence

of Brugia malayi and the expressed sequence tag (EST)
libraries for Onchocerca volvulus, Onchocerca ochengi,
Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, Dirofilaria immitis and
Litomosoides sigmodontis [3] as well as any possible O. volvulus genome sequencing project will be helped by an
understanding of their chromosomes.

Eutely, centromeres and sex determination
The observations of Goldschmidt [4] established the idea
that postembryonic growth in nematodes occurred without further cell division, and this became known as eutely.
For more than 70 years this idea became established in the
general literature (for example, [5]), but it is now clear
that there are many species where it is not true. For example in Caenorhabditis elegans there is a 1.47-fold increase in
the number of somatic nucleii [6] and in Romanomermis
culicivorax there is an 8-fold increase during the parasitic
phase [7]. However, these two species contrast another

feature of nematode development. In C. elegans it is clear
that there is a fixed number of cell divisions (including
post-embryonic cell divisions) during development leading to a constant number of somatic nucleii in the adult
[6]. This is not true of R. culicivorax where the number of
somatic nucleii varies and is correlated with adult size [7].
There have been no specific studies of these patterns in
Filariae, but Bain [8] has reported somatic cell divisions in
developing larvae of O. volvulus in the vector. Furthermore, counts of lacto-acetic orcein stained nucleii [9] of
intrauterine microfilariae and infective L3 larvae of O. volvulus have indicated a mean of 280 nucleii in microfilariae
and approximately 900 in L3s [10]. It is clear that the concept of eutely can not be applied to filariae, because there
is obviously an increase in cell number between these two
post-embryonic stages. It is also unlikely that filariae have
a fixed number of cell divisions because larvae at the same
stage of development were found to show variation in
numbers of somatic nuclei [9].
It seems that most nematodes probably have holocentric
chromosomes (the chromosomes attach to the meiotic
and mitotic spindle microtubules along their whole
length, instead of this function being concentrated into a
single centromere) [11]. A consequence of this is that broken fragments of chromosomes can still assort regularly at
cell division. However, it is clear that the trichurids (at
least) have normal (localised) centromeres, but the situation is not well understood for the filariae. Procunier and
Hirai [12] interpreted their mitotic and meiotic metaphases from O. volvulus and O. gutturosa in terms of localised centromeres, but it is not obvious that their drawn
figures are correct interpretations of their photographs,
and they explained that "the position of the centromere is
not always obvious" and in the longest chromosome its
position "appears to vary between individuals". The chromosomes of the filariae are very small, difficult to interpret and no other authors have directly addressed this
issue. However, the orientation of the chromosomes at
metaphase has been remarked upon. Delves et al. [13]
showed that synaptonemal complexes were present in
early female meiosis of Dirofilaria immitis, but at metaphase I the chromosomes appeared to be pairing end to
end. This was particularly obvious for the X chromosome
pair (which is the longest chromosome in D. immitis)
because a more normal side by side pairing was observed
in only 10% of ova. This same end to end pairing is apparent in the photographs of other authors for other filariae
(for example [14]). In most animals meiotic metaphase
chromosomes show evidence of crossing over (which is
the visible manifestation of recombination), but this is
not obvious for filariae. Procunier and Hirai [12] interpreted their figures to show crossing over, but no other
authors have done so, and it is not clear whether this is
due to the small size of the chromosomes or some more

http://www.filariajournal.com/content/4/1/10

fundamental biological reason. In any case, recombination is expected to occur in filariae because they have synaptonemal complexes [13] and recombination has been
proven in some other nematodes such as Caenorhabditis
[15], and Globodera [16].
Some nematodes such as Strongyloides exhibit forms of
parthenogenesis, and a few such as Mermis subnigrescens
have environmental sex determination (dependant upon
the number of mermithids parasitising a particular insect
host). However, amongst the vertebrate parasites chromosomal sex determination seems to be the rule. And there
seems to be an X0 system in all species where it is known
except the Oxyuridae (which have a system of haplo-diploidy), Ascaridae (which have multiple sex chromosomes) and Filarioidea (where some species of
Onchocercidae have an XY system). It is clear that the X0
system is fundamental to nematodes (including the filariae), and the few XY systems which occur amongst the
filariae are secondary derivatives. In other organisms with
X0 sex chromosomes, such as Orthoptera, the fusion of an
autosome to the X chromosome to create a neo-XY is very
well documented [17]. Genetically, an X0 sex determining
system has to be a 'balance' system, and there is a good
understanding of the molecular basis of sex determination in Caenorhabditis (which has an X0 system, with X0
males and XX hermaphrodites) [18], and it is probable
that filariae are basically similar.

Chromosome numbers and karyotype evolution
Table 1 summarises all published records of filarial karyotypes, and there are apparently three basic types, 5A+X0,
4A+XY and 3A+XY. There are a few exceptions in the literature, and it is not always clear the extent to which these
might be errors resulting from the difficult nature of filarial chromosomes, or indicative of natural variation. Litomosoides sigmodontis has been reported to have either
5A+X0 (new unpublished data, see Figure 1) or 4A+X0
[19,20]. In view of the karyotypes of other X0 species it is
likely that 5A+X0 is correct, and 4A+X0 is either the result
of natural variation for an autosome-autosome translocation or a mistake (due to small difficult chromosomes).
Indeed, there are clearly six chromosomes present in some
of McLaren's [20] illustrations. Similarly Taylor [19]
reported Dirofilaria immitis to have 4A+X0, whilst other
authors reported 5A+X0 [20] or 4A+XY [21,13]. It is possible that this reflects natural variation within Dirofilaria,
but Taylor [19] did not have access to a past body of published work that later cytogeneticists have been able to
build upon, and it seems most likely that 4A+X0 was a
mistake. Post et al. [22] reported that Onchocerca tarsicola
from Germany was 4A+XY (i.e. n = 5), but the same species from Sweden was n = 3. This difference was attributed
to possible intraspecific geographic variation. Most
authors agree that O. volvulus has 3A+XY (i.e. n = 4).

However, Basáñez et al. [23] reported n = 4 or 5, and
Miller [24] reported n = 5. It is likely that these reports are
the result of B-chromosome variation (see below), but
this can not explain the old report by Salazar Mallen et al.
[25] of n = 2. In the absence of corroborating evidence this
report might be thought of as an error resulting from the
experimental use of tissue sections, which is an older
cytogenetic technique that is more problematic than the
newer squash techniques [26].
Figure 2 shows the likely karyotype evolution in the filariae. 5A+X0 is likely to be ancestral because the X0 sex
chromosome system is the almost universal sex chromosome system amongst nematodes (see above), and hence

the XY system is almost certainly a derived (neo-XY) system, resulting from the fusion of an autosome to the old
X-chromosome. There are a number of chromosomal
mechanisms for such a fusion [27]. If the chromosomes
have localized centromeres a Robertsonian translocation
is most likely (i.e. one that occurs at the centromere so
that the resultant fragments still have a single centromere
and hence can disjoin regularly at meiosis and mitosis). If
the chromosomes are holocentric almost any sort of
fusion can occur, because all fragments will show
centromeric activity and can disjoin regularly. In support
of the postulated fusion (by whatever chromosomal
mechanism), the five autosomes and the X-chromosome
of the 5A+X0 species are all approximately the same size

that one of the autosomes is clearly the largest chromosome, and presumably the autosome-autosome fusion
product.

worm, showing five or six condensed chromosomes
(arrowed).

The pattern of karyotype evolution (Figure 2) is likely to
reflect organismal evolution and indicate taxonomic relationships. All species of filarioids which have been examined for their chromosomes are from the family
Onchocercidae, and from three subfamilies, Setariinae
(Seteria spp), Dirofilariinae (Dirofilaria and Loa) and
Onchocercinae (all other species in Table 1). The presumed ancestral state (5A+X0) occurs in the Setariinae,
most of the Onchocercinae and Loa loa (but not Dirofilaria). Current phylogenetic opinion has been unable to
resolve the major clades of the Onchocercinae, which
reduce to a star polytomy [28]. Loa forms a clade from this
unresolved polytomy, but Dirofilaria is consistently
grouped along the Onchocerca clade. The reduction to
4A+XY has occurred in both Dirofilaria and Onchocerca,
and hence it supports the molecular data, but it also indicates that the Onchocerca/Dirofilaria clade is most closely
related to the Wuchereria/Brugia clade because it is found
in both.
The observation that O. volvulus apparently shares the
same karyotype as O. gibsoni, but not O. ochengi or O.
dukei, might be taken as evidence for a close phylogenetic
relationship, and Muller [29] also considered that O. volvulus was most closely related to O. gibsoni on the basis of
the structure of the cuticle. However, Bain [30] held that
O. volvulus was taxonomically more closely related to O.
ochengi, and recent molecular phylogeny reconstruction
using the 12s, 16s and ND5 mitochondrial genes very
strongly supports this view (Morales Hojas, Cheke and
Post, unpublished data). If this is true, it would indicate
that the similar karyotypes of O. volvulus and O. gibsoni
have been produced by two different fusion events (which
may not even have involved the same pairs of autosomes),
and this is likely to be reflected in the precise position of
the translocation breakpoints at the molecular level.

as each other, whereas in the 4A+XY species the four autosomes and the Y-chromosome are of comparable size,
whereas the X-chromosome (which would be an X-autosome fusion product) is visibly larger. The 3A+XY karyotype observed in O. volvulus and O. gibsoni is likely to have
been derived from the 4A+XY karyotype by a fusion
between two autosomes [12]. The relative sizes of the different chromosomes are consistent with this hypothesis in

B-chromosomes and nucleolus organising region
Both O. volvulus and O. gibsoni have B-chromosomes
[12,14]. These are supernumery chromosomes which are
not present in every individual, and when they are present
they can be haploid, diploid, triploid, tetraploid, etc, in
different individuals. The origin and subsequent evolution of B-chromosomes is a long-standing problem in
genetics [31]. B-chromosomes can have definite phenotypic affects, but it has always been unclear whether this
was the result of specific genes or a mere consequence of
the presence of an extra chromosome. It is largely
unknown whether B-chromosomes carry genes and
whether those genes are repeated elsewhere in the more
constant part of the genome. In any case, if the origin of

Filaria Journal 2005, 4:10

the 3A+XY karyotype was the result of some sort of autosome-autosome fusion this would result in one new large
autosome (see Figure 2), and possibly a small chromosomal fragment [27]. The exact nature of the fragment will
depend upon the exact nature of the fusion and there are
a number of potential chromosomal mechanisms, which
partly depend upon the exact nature of the chromosomes.
Procunier and Hirai [12] interpreted the B-chromosomes
of O. volvulus as chromosomal fragments which resulted
from a Robertsonian translocation (i.e. a translocation at
the site of the centromere in a species with localised centromeres) which resulted in a new large autosome and a
small chromosomal fragment. In such cases, both products would be able to assort regularly because both would
have a centromere. If Onchocerca have holocentric chromosomes, any chromosome fragment will show centromeric activity and disjoin regularly.
There have been no attempts to characterize the different
chromosomes of any filariae using chromosome banding
or molecular cytogenetics. The only differences that have
been noted are size differences and sex chromosome differences (see above). However, There has been one
unpublished study of silver staining of O. volvulus (Post &
Bella, unpublished data). Silver staining is a technique
that stains the nucleolus and hence reveals the active
nucleolus organising regions, which is where the active
ribosomal genes (rDNA) are found [32]. In O. volvulus
there was a single nucleolus organizing region, situated at
the centre of the long autosome (Figure 3). There may be
other inactive clusters of rDNA elsewhere in the genome,
and it is interesting to note that rDNA has sometimes been
implicated at the sites of chromosome mutations (such as
translocations) in other organisms such as humans [33].

Conclusion
1. Eutely is certainly not a characteristic of filarial development, and there does not seem to be a constant number of
somatic cells at different developmental stages. However,
it is still possible that the rather constant pattern of cell
lineages seen in Caenorhabditis is present in filariae in
some more flexible form.
2. Although some authors have interpreted their metaphase chromosome figures as indicating localised centromeres this is unusual in nematodes, which usually
have holocentric chromosomes. Meiotic metaphase chromosomes exhibit an unusual appearance of end to end
pairing in filariae, which is not consistent with having a
localised centromere. The nature of the centromere in
filariae remains to be resolved.
3. Sex determination in filariae is chromosomal and fundamentally of the X0 type, although in some species of the

Onchocercidae this has been secondarily modified into a
neo-XY system by the fusion of an autosome onto the old
X chromosome. X0 sex determination is genetically a
balance system, and likely to be similar to that described
at the molecular level in Caenorhabditis.
4. The primitive karyotype of the Filarioidea is presumed
to be 5A+X0, because the X0 chromosomal sex determining system seems to be almost universal amongst nematodes in general. However, in some Onchocercidae there
has been an X-autosome fusion to produce a neo-XY system with four autosomal pairs (4A+XY). In O. volvulus and
O. gibsoni there has been a further fusion of two autosomes to yield a karyotype of 3A+XY. This second step
might have occurred independently in the two species.
5. Both O. volvulus and O. gibsoni have B-chromosomes,
probably resulting from the autosome-autosome translocation which reduced the karyotype to n = 4. However,
nothing is known about these chromosomes in terms of
their genetics or potential phenotypic effects.
6. In O. volvulus there is a single active nucleolus organizing region (where the active rDNA occurs) near the centre
of the long autosome, near the site of the chromosomal
fusion event.
