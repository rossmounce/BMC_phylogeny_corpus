Abstract
Background: Mature saturated brine (crystallizers) communities are largely dominated (>80% of cells)
by the square halophilic archaeon "Haloquadratum walsbyi". The recent cultivation of the strain HBSQ001
and thesequencing of its genome allows comparison with the metagenome of this taxonomically simplified
environment. Similar studies carried out in other extreme environments have revealed very little diversity
in gene content among the cell lineages present.
Results: The metagenome of the microbial community of a crystallizer pond has been analyzed by end
sequencing a 2000 clone fosmid library and comparing the sequences obtained with the genome sequence
of "Haloquadratum walsbyi". The genome of the sequenced strain was retrieved nearly complete within this
environmental DNA library. However, many ORF's that could be ascribed to the "Haloquadratum"
metapopulation by common genome characteristics or scaffolding to the strain genome were not present
in the specific sequenced isolate. Particularly, three regions of the sequenced genome were associated with
multiple rearrangements and the presence of different genes from the metapopulation. Many transposition
and phage related genes were found within this pool which, together with the associated atypical GC
content in these areas, supports lateral gene transfer mediated by these elements as the most probable
genetic cause of this variability. Additionally, these sequences were highly enriched in putative regulatory
and signal transduction functions.
Conclusion: These results point to a large pan-genome (total gene repertoire of the genus/species) even
in this highly specialized extremophile and at a single geographic location. The extensive gene repertoire
is what might be expected of a population that exploits a diverse nutrient pool, resulting from the
degradation of biomass produced at lower salinities.

Background
Extreme environments provide simplified microbial communities which may be usefully compared and contrasted
with more complex ecosystems. Community complexity
is often assessed in terms of the diversity of phylogenetic
markers such as 16S ribosomal RNA – but generally we do
not know the extent to which organisms with identical or
very similar sequences for phylogenetic sequences differ
in other shared genes and in gene content. Indeed, complete genome sequences for multiple strains of the same
species (usually cultivatable pathogenic organisms) often
reveal widely different gene complements [1-4]. Genes
present in only a few strains of a species have been
described as "accessory or adaptive", since they do not
appear to be essential for cell survival, but instead provide
the possibility to adapt to environmental fluctuations (for
example, use different nutrients) [5]. Knowledge about
accessory gene pools (their sizes and compositions) will
be essential in areas from ecology (how many different
phenotypes can be encompassed by cells carrying this
marker) to biotechnology (gene diversity available for
exploitation).
One approach to assessing a species' or accessory gene
pool is to compare a sequenced genome to a metagenomic sequence database obtained from an environment
in which that organism dominates. In this way the usual
biases and limitations associated with comparing different isolates from the same species by complete genome
sequencing and/or substractive or microarray hybridization are avoided. A recent paper describing an acid mine
drainage biofilm metagenome using shotgun cloning and
sequencing detected very little gene content diversity
among two dominant species in the community [6]. Our
results suggest a different pattern for saltern crystallizers.
Saltern crystallizers (NaCl saturated) have been studied
extensively by molecular methods and prove to be among
the simplest known communities in terms of species composition by both classical microbiological and molecular
methods [7-12]. The saturated NaCl concentrations
together with high levels of magnesium inhibit the growth
of all but the most resilient hyperhalophilic archaea and
bacteria [13]. A number of molecular approaches have
shown that the dense prokaryotic populations (reaching
up to 108 cells per ml) are largely dominated by members
of the recently cultivated square-shaped archaeon "Haloquadratum walsbyi" [7-9,11,14]. This organism was first
described in 1980 before the recognition of the domain
Archaea and was for a long time known as "Walsby's
square bacterium" [15]. The species appears cosmopolitan: 16S rDNA sequences retrieved from these haloarchaea do not diverge by more than 1.6% worldwide,]:
Spanish and Australian isolates [16] differ only in two
nucleotides across the whole 16S rRNA gene [17]. The

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/171

peculiar morphology of this organism (square flattened
cells of 2–5 μm sides) permits enrichment by filtration ;
smaller rod and spiral-shaped cells pass through a 2 μm
pore size filter and the square-shaped cells are retained.
The genome of the Spanish isolate HQSB001 has been
fully sequenced and annotated and we had access to the
annotated genome of this strain [18].
In this work we isolated biomass from a saltern crystallizer
with the aim of retrieving mostly "H. walsbyi"- related
material, and compared the recovered gene diversity with
that of the sequenced strain's genome, isolated specifically
from this same pond two years earlier [17]. The results of
this study, which involved end-sequencing of ca. 2000
fosmid clones suggest that "H. walsbyi" shares a large
accessory gene pool that could easily exceed the size of the
sequenced strain's genome.

Results
Metagenomic library coverage and taxonomic diversity
The crystallizer pond populations from which this DNA
was extracted has been the focus of a series of molecular
studies over the last 12 years, and we have substantial
information regarding the prokaryotic composition of
this particular pond [7,8,10-12,14,19-21]. However, the
microbial community could be affected by long term or
seasonal changes so we used PCR amplification, cloning
and sequencing to characterize the specific sample used
for metagenomic library construction and as a control for
the suitability of the filtration method used for sample
fractionation (see materials and methods). We sequenced
about 40 cloned 16S rDNA genes from each fraction (2
μm and 0.2 μm). As expected the proportion of "Haloquadratum"-related clones was appreciably higher in the 2
μm fraction (66% of the total of the clones) than the 0.2
μm fraction (50%). Additionally, Salinibacter ruber, the
other major component of the community [22] was effectively removed from the 2 μm fraction (2% of the total
clones in the 2 μm filter versus 15% on the 0.2 μm filter)
which is confirmed in the fosmid library analysis (see
below). As expected, the diversity of both Archaea and Bacteria was very restricted. "Haloquadratum"-related clones
were predominant in the archaeal primers clone library.
Out of 40 clones 27 were highly similar to "Haloquadratum" seven were similar to Haloarchaeon CSW2.24.4 [GenBank: AY498650], an isolate from a crystallizer pond in
Victoria, Australia [23], three were similar to Halosimplex
carlsbadense and three were similar to Halorubrum tibetense.
Among the "Haloquadratum"-related clones the variability
was extremely low, with most sequences diverging less
than 1%. Moreover these clones were highly related (≥
98.8%) to sequences retrieved from the same pond by
PCR amplification twelve years ago [7]. Overall, the
"Haloquadratum" affiliated 16S rDNA gene sequences
retrieved from this pond in different surveys and with dif-

ferent methodologies were highly conserved, and never
diverged more than 1.6%, reflecting the high degree of
homogeneity of the 16S rRNA genes of this species and/or
the stability of the population in this crystallizer.
The fosmid library constructed from the 2 μm fraction was
composed of ca 2000 clones with an average insert size of
35 Kb. Thus, the total amount of cloned environmental
DNA is in the order of 70 Mb. Given that the genomic
diversity of this environment was previously calculated to
be to 7 E. coli genome equivalents (i.e. 30 Mb) by DNA/
DNA reassociation [24] the size of the library was considered sufficient to cover the numerically dominant "Haloquadratum" related lineages. PCR screening of the
metagenome library revealed eight 16S rRNA genes, five
of which were highly related to "Haloquadratum walsbyi"
(4 were 100% identical and one had six nucleotide differ-

ences in a 500 bp fragment). Of the remaining three, two
were related to Haloarchaeon CSW4.24.4 [GenBank:
AY498650] and one to the genus Halosimplex. Fosmids
that contained one of the rRNA operons of "Haloquadratum" (02B08 and 07B05), were fully sequenced and compared with the "H. walsbyi" strain HBSQ001 genome [25].
The similarity is very high throughout this fragment indicating how highly conserved this part of the genome is
(Figure 1). Strain HBSQ001 was isolated two years before
the samples used in this study were obtained. Every year
the crystallizer ponds are emptied to harvest the salt and
then refilled with water from lower salinity ponds. Therefore the environmental DNA and the strain do not come
from the same body of water although the location is the
same.

Analysis of the library by fosmid end-sequencing
For this work fosmids ends were sequenced using vector
primers. We regularly obtained sequences over 500 nucleotides and the success rate was acceptable (~74%). In total
2948 individual end sequences were determined with an
average size of 818 bps, generating ca 2.4 Mb of DNA
sequence data. Given the availability of the complete "H.
walsbyi" strain HBSQ001 genome sequence [25], comparison of the metagenome library was straightforward (Figure 2). One thousand and twenty-nine sequences (1029)
with more than 94% nucleotide identity to the HBSQ001
genome were considered as bona-fide "H. walsbyi"
(belonging to lineages closely related to the sequenced
strain). This range of sequence similarity is commonly
observed with groups designated as "species" by other criteria [26]. Another set of 261 sequences with 80% to 94%
identity to the HBSQ001 genome was categorized as
"Haloquadratum". Finally, 173 sequences with no similarity to the HBSQ001 genome on one end of the fosmid
insert, but in which the other end showed >80% DNA
identity with HBSQ001 were given the "Haloquadratum"scaffold (Hq-scaffold) tag. The majority of these 173
sequences have a low GC content, which is characteristic
of genes in the sequenced HBSQ001 genome and which is

unlike all other known haloarchaeal and hyperhalophilic
bacterial genomes [12]. The fosmids depicted in Figure 3
and indeed of most sequences in the metagenome library
(Figure 4) have this unique and defining characteristic.
Most of these fosmid inserts had sequences at both ends
with high similarity to HBSQ001. Assuming that fosmid
inserts are shorter in length than 60 Kb and may correspond to identical regions on the HBSQ001 genome, synteny between the cloned environmental DNA fragments
and HBSQ001 could be assessed. We identified 457 fosmids in which both ends had hits located at less than 60
Kb apart (average 35.2 Kb) and with >80% DNA identity
(average 96.4%). Concatenation of the sequences from
these syntenic fosmid inserts would have allowed the
reconstruction of more than 92% of the HBSQ001 chromosome, with an average coverage of 5.7X (Figure 5). This
analysis also identified 66 fosmid inserts in which both
ends have at least 80% DNA identity to HBSQ001 but
which are more than 60 Kb apart on the HSBQ001
genome. Indeed, the average distance between the corresponding HBSQ001 sequences was 589 Kb, indicating
that large genomic rearrangements had taken place in the
HBSQ001 genome or the genome from which the fosmid

insert came. Rearrangments seemed to correlate somewhat with DNA divergence since 24% (30 out of 123) of
the fosmid inserts with at least one end having between
80% and 94% identity with the strain HBSQ001 were
rearranged, compared with only 9% (37 out of 402) of
those in which both ends had >94% DNA identity.
The 173 fosmids having similarity to HBSQ001 at just one
end must represent borderline sections in the genomes of
the metapopulation where synteny with the sequenced
strain is broken. The location of these sequences, plus the
sequences from the 66 fosmid inserts in which there is
greater than 60 Kb between HBSQ001 homologs were
plotted onto the HBSQ001 genome (Figure 5). Results
from this analysis indicate that the distribution of these
discontinuities is widespread in the genome, but is by no
means random and there may be rearrangement "hotspots". A GC content plot for the HBSQ001 genome
shows two relatively "choppy" regions (large high and
low peaks) each about 0.5 Mb interspersed with relatively
"calm" regions with fewer and smaller peaks. The frequency of the discontinuity events is correlated with larger

amplitude variance in the GC content (Figure 5). In particular, a large segment of 541 Kb starting at position 543
Kb, contains only 11 discontinuities (on average, one per
49.2 Kb) in spite of being heavily covered in the metagenome library, whereas the contiguous 324 Kb region,
within the first choppy region, contains 37 discontinuities
(one per 8.5 Kb). A lack of synteny is also associated with
the low level of HBSQ genome coverage from the environmental library (Figure 5). This observation is consistent
with these regions being present in the sequenced strain
but not in many of the environmental lineages. The accessory gene pools of pathogenic bacteria are also found in
regions of atypical GC content [27].
Taking advantage of the fact that HBSQ001 has an average
GC-content that is nearly 20% lower than all other known
hyperhalophiles, we also identified metagenomic
sequences as coming from "Haloquadratum" by analyzing
their GC-content (Figure 3 and 4) [28]. Establishing an
upper cut-off value of 55%, allowed categorization of 414
sequences with no similarity to the HBSQ001 genome
(which has a GC-content lower than 55%) as most likely

belonging to "Haloquadratum" lineages. Trinucleotide
analysis (Figure 6) shows that a clear majority of these
"low-GC" sequences possess a "H. waslsbyi"- like sequence
signature, supporting our hypothesis that most of these
indeed consist of sequences found associated with cells
within the "Haloquadratum" population. These 414
sequences together with the 173 sequences previously
identified as Hq-scaffold must represent the accessory
pool for this species in this specific environment since
they are not present in the sequenced strain and therefore
cannot be essential for its survival and contained only
within certain lineages of the environmental diversity of
the species. Hereafter we will refer to this combined set as
the "accessory sequence pool".
It is also noteworthy that we found 17 fosmids with high
similarity (at least at one end to the Salinibacter ruber
genome. The only other organism to which similarities
over 94% nucleotide identity to protein coding genes were
found.
Functional analysis of the accessory gene pool
As expected, a majority of fosmid-insert ends with high
DNA sequence identity to the HBSQ001 genome (~1200)

also had a best amino-acid BLAST hit to putative proteins
in HBSQ001. These sequences represent a bit more than
28% of its genome and have an average amino acid identity greater than 91%. Most interesting are the sets of endsequences lacking DNA similarity to HBSQ001 but in the
"accessory sequence pool". Among the 587 such
sequences, 232 (40%) had best hits to putative "H. walsbyi" (average aa. identity of 61%) or other haloarchaeal
genes, 51 (9%) were similar to other archaea or bacteria,
and another 304 (52%) had no hit in public databases.
One hundred and twenty-four of these 304 sequences had
predicted ORFs of 100 amino-acids long or longer. A low
theoretical pI value, which is characteristic of halophilic
proteomes [29] was found for a majority of these predicted ORFs, indicating that at least some of them may be
translated into functional proteins.
Functional category distribution analysis of the 283 accessory gene pool sequences, strain HBSQ001, "H. walsbyi"
fosmid-ends, and "Haloquadratum" fosmid-ends, revealed
important differences in several categories (Figure 7).
Indeed, some "core" functional categories are clearly
underrepresented in the "accessory sequence pool", such
as that of transcription, translation, and energy metabo-

Distribution of the fosmid-end sequences along the HBSQ001 chromosome showing coverage and discontinuities. Position for each fosmid-end is obtained from the best blast hit between the fosmid-end and the HBSQ001 chromosome.
'GC-HBSQ001' consists of the number of guanine (G) and cytosine (C) nucleotides out of every 10 nucleotide on the
HBSQ001 chromosome (averaged over 10 Kb). At any corresponding nucleotide position on the HBSQ001 genome (x-axis):
'coverage' consists in the number (averaged over 10 Kb) of fosmids from the library where both ends have more than 80%
DNA identity to HBSQ001 and for which distance between corresponding BLAST hit positions on the HBSQ001 genome is
smaller than 60 Kb; discontinuities consist of the number (averaged over 60 Kb) of 1) fosmid end sequences with more than
80% DNA identity to HBSQ001 but for which the other end gives no hit to HBSQ001 and 2) fosmids for which distance
between corresponding BLAST hit positions on the HBSQ001 chromosome is greater than 60 Kb. "Choppy" regions are highlited by a grey background.

lism. Conversely "peripheral" functional categories such
as signal transduction and gene regulation are overrepresented in that set, as well as IS-encoded transposases, conserved hypothetical proteins and sequences with illdefined function (miscellaneous). Unexpectedly a relatively large number of cell-envelope components were
also detected in this gene pool.

Discussion
During the last few years there has been a dramatic change
in the understanding of the dynamics of microbial
genomes. The tradition established by the first population
genetics studies carried out in the 1980's was to consider
that mutation was the driving factor in bacterial adaptation and diversification, as is the case in model metazoan
and plant organisms. However, comparative genomics
has changed this view, indicating that indeed the main
variable that allows adaptation to different niches is the
presence of variable gene pools in different strains. These
so-called accessory pools are involved in differences in
pathogenecity and many other properties that are strainspecific [29,30]. Most of the information obtained in this

field derives from comparing different isolates from the
same designated species. The problem with using single
isolates is that there is always a certain bias of isolation
and it is difficult to infer how representative such isolates
are of their natural populations. This is particularly an
issue when dealing with non pathogenic organisms with
which there may also be considerable microdiversity in
the sample or habitat [3,31]. So far, the most thorough
attempt to retrieve information from directly sequencing
an environmental DNA dominated by one species indicated very little variability in gene content among the lineages present in it [6] although a considerable sexual
exchange was detected among lineages within the population.
Our study hints to a potentially large gene reservoir in the
saltern habitat. The roughly 1/3 of sequences retrieved
with high GC values and no similarity to either "Haloquadratum" or Salinibacter (or to any GenBank entry) belong
with all probability to other haloarcheal (or bacterial)
species present in the crystallizer that had not been
detected previously by 16S rDNA amplification and

sequencing, T-RFLP or FISH and demonstrate the limitations of these techniques. Still approximately 2/3 of the
fosmid library most likely belong to "H. walsbyi" or closely
related lineages, as shown by the similarity of the 16S
rRNA genes retrieved from the library, the percent GC and
trinucleotide frequency values and, in many cases, the
high similarity to the sequenced strain HBSQ001. In this
sense it is remarkable to observe that nearly identical
sequences were found for the two completely sequenced
fosmid inserts that contained rRNA ribosomal operons.
This, together with the virtual retrieval of the near complete HBSQ001 genome, hints to the permanence of a "H.
walsbyi" backbone genome with a high degree of conservation. But it is also apparent from this work that there are
other lineages sharing the environment that differ in (i)
synteny (ii) gene content and probably also (iii) pool of
paralogous genes. Some "choppy" clusters rich in transposable elements found in the HBSQ001 strain appear to
be underrepresented in the population captured in the

fosmid library. On the other hand, many genes present in
the library also appear to be absent from the sequenced
"H. walsbyi" isolate. The architecture of the metagenome
would be as depicted in Figure 5. The fraction of genes
(about 80% of a typical strain genome size) that is shared
by most (or all) the lineages would represent the "core"
genome [27] of the species. This core contains the genes
that provide essential cell biology functions and in which
variation would be deleterious (see below). On the other
hand, certain regions at relatively conserved locations of
individual genomes contain highly variable sets of genes,
which we identify as "accessory". Although such genes
represent a minority for any specific individual genome
(about 20%) the total number of genes contained within
this variable compartment could be very large (in the
present case not less than 3 Mb or a genome equivalent).
The large fluctuations with respect to the average genome
GC content (together with the study of the corresponding
regions of the HBSQ001 genome) suggest an involvement

of IS elements and phage related genes in the the evolutionary dynamics of this accessory gene pool.
The salterrn crystallizer studied is barely 20 cm deep and
no benthic communities are known. Still, this environment could offer a variety of microniches. Suspended
particules could harbor different microbiota, with different nutrional characteristics, as has been demonstated for
open-ocean environments [32,33]. Diel and seasonal
cycles might generate ecological diversity, and the complexity of the nutrient pool in the crystallizers is great. The
major nutrient source would be dead and lysed cells of the
eukaryotic alga Dunaliella, which is the primary producer
at lower salinities. Full utilization of this complex
resource would require either an enormous genome
encoding all required metabolic pathways or a diverse
pool of lineages each with slightly different degradative
properties.
Our data suggest that there is indeed a diverse pool of lineages. The enrichment in signal transduction (environmental sensing) and gene regulation in the accessory pool
(that is among genes found only in some strains) suggests

a key role in microadaptation to slightly different niches.
Transcriptional regulators or signal transduction could
produce diversity in the response to environmental
change that might optimize resource exploitation under
varying conditions. This is particularly remarkable for a
non motile organism like "Haloquadratum". The production of gas-vesicles must provide some control over cell
location in their habitat, but the responses to environmental gradients must be rather limited. Less expected but
also present among accessory genes were those encoding
cell envelope components which might be involved in
phage evasion (there are no other predators in the crystallizer). Suggestive as these correlations are, we cannot at
the moment discount the possibility that many of the differences in gene content are effectively neutral, and only
observable because of a high rate of DNA exchange [3].
Our results contribute to an appreciation of the problems
associated with assembling complete genome of any single uncultured strain in such a complex community of
related strains, for example when shotgun strategies are
used [34,35]. Conserved genes can be identified and conserved regions might be mapped, but lack of synteny and

variable gene content in other regions would preclude the
scaffolding of any complete genome. Thus complete
sequencing of the genomes of selected isolates in pure culture remains a valuable and possibly essential adjunct to
metagenomic studies such as ours.

Conclusion
Nearly all of the genes in the genome of the sequenced
strain "Haloquadratum walsbyi" (HBSQ001) were recovered from our environmental DNA library, and many of
our fosmids exhibited synteny with that genome.
HQSB001 was isolated from the same saltern as our environmental DNA samples but two years before.
The pan-genome of this metapopulation in this specific
habitat and location contains at least another genome
equivalent (ca 3 Mb) in addition to the genome of the
sequenced strain
The differential gene content is found associated mostly
with regions of atypical GC content and a high frequency
of phage/IS elements, suggesting an involvement of such
elements and horizontal gene transfer in the maintenance
of the accessory gene pool. The accessory genes often
appear to be involved in regulation and signal transduction, underscoring the importance of these processes in
the adaptation of specific lineages to specific heterotrophic microniches in this nutrient rich habitat.

Methods
Sampling, DNA extraction and 16S rRNA gene PCR
amplification, clone libraries construction and sequencing
The sample used to construct the genomic and the clone
libraries was collected from the crystallizer pond CR30 in
the multi-pond saltern "Bras del Port" located in Santa
Pola (Alicante, Spain, 38° 12' N, 0° 36' W) in November
2002. The salinity was measured in situ with a hand refractometer (Atago). The sample was prefiltered through a filter paper to remove the biomass of small eucaryotic
organisms (e.g. mosquitoes and copepods) and other particles in suspension. Then it was left still at room temperature for two hours in order to recover the green alga
Dunaliella salina, very abundant in the environment at the
time of the sampling, from the surface of the bottle by
aspiration. The sample was then filtered sequentially
through 2 μm (Isopore, Millipore) and 0.2 μm pore size
filters Durapore, Millipore). Filters were stored at -80°C
until DNA extraction. Thawed filters were cut with a sterile
razor blade in small pieces and vortexed in 2 ml of sterile
water in 15 ml conical base polypropylene centrifuge
tubes. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube, and
0.1 vol of 10% sodium dodecil sulphate and proteinase K
(0.5 mg/ml) were added. The tubes were incubated at
55°C for 2 h and in a boiling water bath for 2 min. The
lysates were extracted twice with phenol-clhoroform-iso-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/171

amyl alcohol (25:24:1) and once with chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (24:1). The purified nucleic acids were
concentrated by ethanol precipitation, resuspended in
sterile Milli-Q water and stored at -20°C.
PCR 16S rRNA gene amplification was carried out using
the 16S rDNA archaeal-specific primer 21F (TTCCGGTTGATCCTGCCGGA) and 16S rDNA bacterial-specific
primer ANT1 (AGAGTTTGATCATGGCTCAG) and using
the universal primer S, as reverse (GGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT) for both. Two independent PCR reactions for
each primer combination (Archaea and Bacteria domain)
were carried out under the following standard conditions:
35 cycles (denaturation at 94°C for 15 s, annealing at
55°C for 30 s, extension at 72°C for 3 min) preceded by
2 min denaturation at 94°C and followed by 5 min extension at 72°C. PCR products obtained of each primer combination were purified with Qiaquick PCR purification kit
(Qiagen). Clone libraries were constructed using the Topo
TA cloning system (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer
recommendations. The plasmids of positives clones were
extracted and measured with Hoescht fluorescent dye. The
concentration of the plasmid/PCR product was adjusted
to 0.075 pM in 6 μl by dilution with sterile water. The
sequencing reaction was performed by PCR amplification
in a final volume of 10 μl using 0.05 pM of plasmid, 4
pmoles of primer, and 1 to 3 μl of Big Dye Terminators
premix, according to Applied Biosystems protocol. After
heating to 98°C for 5 min, the reaction was cycled as follows: 30–40 cycles of 30s at 96°C, 30s at 55°C, and 4 min
at 60°C (9700 thermal cycler AB). Removal of excess of
Big Dye Terminators was performed by ethanol precipitation. The samples were dried in a vacuum centrifuge, dissolved in 10 μl of formamide, loaded onto an Applied
Biosystems 3730 sequencer and run for 2 hours. For
sequencing, primers B1055 (for bacterial clones) and
Arc915 (for archaeal clones) were used.
Genomic library construction
Our environmental genomic library was constructed with
DNA corresponding to the >2 μm biomass fraction. We
started from an initial amount of ~3.5 mg of DNA, as estimated by comparison with different amounts of linear T7
DNA in agarose gels. DNA was broken by mechanical
shearing and fractionated in a 0.8% low-melting point
agarose gel after DNA ends were repaired (EpiFOS™ Fosmid Library Production Kit, Epicentre). The band corresponding to 35–45 Kb DNA fragments was cut from the
gel, digested with gelase and cloned in the 7500 bp-EpiFOS™-5 Fosmid Vector (Epicentre). The ligated fosmids
were packaged in phage particles and used to transfect E.
coli EPI100™ (Epicentre). A total of 2000 fosmid clones
were obtained in this way, i.e. an initial library of 70–80
Mb, assuming an average insert size of 35–40 Kb.

End sequencing of fosmids clones
The DNA from fosmid clones was prepared using the
Eppendorf Perfectprep-96 BAC DNA Extraction Kit
(Brinkmann) and the quality of DNA was checked on a
1% agarose gel after a NotI digestion. The sequencing
reactions were performed using approximately 500 ng of
template with half-strength ET Terminator reactions
(Amersham Biosciences) in both forward and reverse
directions. The reaction products were cleaned and analyzed using a MegaBACE 1000 DNA Sequencer (Amersham Biosciences). Primers used: T3 and T7 (AAT TAA
CCC TCA CTA AAG GG and GTA ATA CGA CTCACT ATA
GGG C respectively) (Integrated DNA Technologies).
Metagenomic library screening and sequencing of fosmid
clones containing 16S rRNA genes
The library was pooled in groups of 48 clones (50 μl of
each clone) that served for PCR screening. The fosmids
were extracted with Qiaprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen)
and resuspended in 50 μl of sterile Milli-Q water. The PCR
screening and 16S rRNA gene sequence was carried out as
above. Eight pools gave expected-size (~1.5 Kb) amplification products. Further PCR screening of individual clones
integrating these pools led to the identification of eight
archaeal 16S rDNA-containing fosmid clones. The eight
amplicons were fully sequenced using primers 21F, 640R
(GGATTTCACTCCTACCCC),
958R
(ACCGGCGTTGACTCCAATT), and 1492R. From these, only clones
02B08 and 07B05 affiliated to "Haloquadratum walsbyi",
were fully sequenced (Genome Express), DNA was purified from a 1 ml overnight culture. A shotgun library was
generated by subcloning mechanically sheared DNA
(2.5–5 Kb) into pUC18. Inserts were sequenced with vector primers using a MegaBase 4000 capillary sequencer
(Amershan Biosciences).
Fosmid end sequences DNA-analysis
The BLAST program blastn [36] was used to compare the
end sequences against the complete genome sequence of
"Haloquadratum walsbyi" [25]. The following blast parameters were used: "-q -1 -r 1 -F F". All sequences with a blast
hit to HBSQ001 of at least 100 base pairs and more than
94% DNA-DNA identity were categorized as "H. walsbyi",
>94%" while hits to HBSQ001 of at least 100 bps and
between 80% and 94% DNA-DNA identity were classified
as "Haloquadratum". These cutoffs of 80% and 94% were
chosen based on the distribution of the blast hits (Figures
2, 3). For some fosmids, a significant (>100 bps, >80%
identity) hit was found only at one end. In those cases, the
other end sequence, although it did not show DNA similarity to the genome sequence of "H. walsbyi", was
assigned to belong to a set of "Haloquadratum" -scaffold
sequences. Finally each of the remaining sequences were
binned as either "low-GC" (GC-content less or equal to
55%) or "high-GC" (GC-content greater than 55%), based

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/171

on the analysis of GC-content distribution of end
sequences, which clearly showed two sets with nearly no
overlap, one peaking around 48%, the average GC-value
of "Haloquadratum", and another less sharp peak around
64%, close to the average GC-value of most other known
hyperhalophiles. Several perl scripts were written to investigate the distribution of hits along the "H. walsbyi" chromosome. A perl program was also written to perfom
trinucleotide analysis, based on the formula described in
[37]. Multidimensional scaling of trinucleotide signatures
to 2-dimensions was performed using the software RuG/
L04 [38]. Fosmid end sequences have been deposited in
GenBank with accession numbers
DU824018 to
DU826964.
Fosmid end sequences functional analysis
The program BLAST blastx (translated DNA vs protein)
was used to extract functional information from end
sequences. All end sequences were blasted against the nr
database and against "Haloquadratum". All hits below 30
amino acids or with an e-value greater than 10e-5 were
considered non-significant, and all hits with a score below
80 or with a best hit to eukaryotes were manually verified.
For each sequence where a significant hit could be found,
another round of BLAST was performed on parts of the
sequence not covered by the best blast hit. Preliminary
analysis of the results of this additional gene fragments
showed that they did not impact the results significantly
and so they were ignored in the final results compilation.
Functional categories for ORFs with a best match in
HBSQ001 were assigned based on the HBSQ001 genome
annotation [25]. The functional category was assigned
manually for all other hits, using the HBSQ001 categories
as a template. For end sequences without hit to any
known sequence, the large ORFs (>100 a.a) were identified using getorf program from EMBOSS package [39].
Isoelectric point calculations were made using the
Sequence manipulating suite web interface [40].
Analysis and annotation of fosmids 02B08 and 07B05
Potential ORFs for the two complete fosmids 02B08 (38.7
Kb) and 07B05 (42.5Kb) were extracted using the gene
finding program glimmer [41]. Spacers were subsequently
blasted against the nr public database to ensure that no
ORF had been missed. The HBSQ001 genome annotation
was also helpful in confirming potential ORFs, start positions and annotation for the two fosmids. DNA similarity
comparisons between the two fosmids and with
HBSQ001 was performed using the BLAST program
blastn, with parameters "-q -1 -r 1 -F F".
