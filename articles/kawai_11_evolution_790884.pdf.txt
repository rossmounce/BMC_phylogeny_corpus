Abstract
Background: The genome of Helicobacter pylori, an oncogenic bacterium in the human stomach, rapidly evolves
and shows wide geographical divergence. The high incidence of stomach cancer in East Asia might be related to
bacterial genotype. We used newly developed comparative methods to follow the evolution of East Asian H. pylori
genomes using 20 complete genome sequences from Japanese, Korean, Amerind, European, and West African
strains.
Results: A phylogenetic tree of concatenated well-defined core genes supported divergence of the East Asian
lineage (hspEAsia; Japanese and Korean) from the European lineage ancestor, and then from the Amerind lineage
ancestor. Phylogenetic profiling revealed a large difference in the repertoire of outer membrane proteins (including
oipA, hopMN, babABC, sabAB and vacA-2) through gene loss, gain, and mutation. All known functions associated
with molybdenum, a rare element essential to nearly all organisms that catalyzes two-electron-transfer oxidationreduction reactions, appeared to be inactivated. Two pathways linking acetyl~CoA and acetate appeared intact in
some Japanese strains. Phylogenetic analysis revealed greater divergence between the East Asian (hspEAsia) and
the European (hpEurope) genomes in proteins in host interaction, specifically virulence factors (tipa), outer
membrane proteins, and lipopolysaccharide synthesis (human Lewis antigen mimicry) enzymes. Divergence was
also seen in proteins in electron transfer and translation fidelity (miaA, tilS), a DNA recombinase/exonuclease that
recognizes genome identity (addA), and DNA/RNA hybrid nucleases (rnhAB). Positively selected amino acid changes
between hspEAsia and hpEurope were mapped to products of cagA, vacA, homC (outer membrane protein), sotB
(sugar transport), and a translation fidelity factor (miaA). Large divergence was seen in genes related to antibiotics:
frxA (metronidazole resistance), def (peptide deformylase, drug target), and ftsA (actin-like, drug target).
Conclusions: These results demonstrate dramatic genome evolution within a species, especially in likely host
interaction genes. The East Asian strains appear to differ greatly from the European strains in electron transfer and
redox reactions. These findings also suggest a model of adaptive evolution through proteome diversification and
selection through modulation of translational fidelity. The results define H. pylori East Asian lineages and provide
essential information for understanding their pathogenesis and designing drugs and therapies that target them.

Background
Genome sequence comparison within a species can
reveal genome evolution processes in detail and provide
insights for basic and applied research. For bacteria, this
approach has been quite powerful in revealing horizontal gene transfer, gene decay, and genome rearrangements underlying adaptation, such as evolution of
virulence [1]. Comparison of many complete genome
sequences is feasible through innovations in DNA
sequencing.
Helicobacter pylori was the first species for which two
complete genome sequences were available [2]. This
species of ε-proteobacteria causes gastritis, gastric (stomach) ulcer, and duodenal ulcer, and is associated with
gastric cancer and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue
(MALT) lymphoma [3,4]. Animal models show a causal
link between H. pylori and gastric cancer [5,6]. Recent
clinical work in Japan suggests that H. pylori eradication
reduces the risk of new gastric carcinomas in patients
with a history of the disease [7].
H. pylori shows a high mutation rate and an even
higher rate of homologous recombination [8]. Phylogenetic analysis based on several genes revealed geographical differentiation since H. pylori left Africa
together with Homo sapiens [9]. The analysis indicated that the East Asian type (hpEastAsia) is classified into at least three subtypes: East Asian
(hspEAsia), Pacific (hspMaori) and native American
(hspAmerind) [9,10]. The East Asia subtype (hspEAsia) may be related to the high incidence of gastric
cancer in East Asia [4].
H. pylori CagA is considered to be a major virulence
factor associated with gastric cancer. CagA is delivered
into gastric epithelial cells and undergoes phosphorylation by host kinases. Membrane-localized CagA mimics
mammalian scaffold proteins, perturbs signaling pathways and promotes transformation. CagA is noted for
structural diversity in its C-terminal region, which interacts with host cell proteins. It is classified into Western
and East Asian types, with higher activities associated
with the latter [11]. The East Asian CagA-positive H.
pylori infection is more closely associated with gastric
cancer [12]. Geographical differences have also been
noted for other genes [13-17].
To fully characterize these bacteria (hspEAsia subtype
of H. pylori) and to study underlying intraspecific
(within-species) evolutionary processes in detail at the
genome sequence level, we determined the genome
sequence of four Japanese strains and compared them
to available complete H. pylori genome sequences. The
sequences of the Japanese strains and two Korean
strains were different in gene content from the European and West African genomes and from the Amerind genome. Unexpectedly, divergence was seen in

genes related to electron transfer and translation fidelity,
as well as virulence and host interaction.

Results
The complete genome sequences of four H. pylori
strains (F57, F32, F30 and F16) isolated from different
individuals in Fukui, Japan were determined. We compared 20 complete genomes of H. pylori (the 4 new genomes and 16 genomes in the public domain; Table 1),
focusing on their gene contents.
Japanese/Korean core genomes diverged from the
European and then the Amerind

A phylogenetic tree was constructed from concatenated
seven genes atpA, efp, mutY, ppa, trpC, ureI and yphC,
which were used for multi-locus sequence typing
(MLST) [18] and phylogenetic analyses [19,20]) (Additional file 1 (= Figure S1)). The tree showed that the 6
East Asian strains, the 4 Japanese strains (F57, F32, F30
and F16) and the 2 Korean strains (strain 51 and strain
52), are close to the known subpopulation hspEAsia of
hpEastAsia, whereas 4 strains (Shi470 [21], v225d [22],
Sat464 and Cuz20) are close to another subpopulation of
hpEastAsia, hspAmerind. Strains 26695, HPAG1, G27,
P12, B38, B8 and SJM180 were assigned to hpEurope.
Strains J99 and 908 were assigned to hspWAfrica of hpAfrica1. PeCan4 was tentatively assigned to hspAmerind
although it appears to be separate from the above 4
hspAmerind strains and somewhat closer to other subgroups (a subgroup of hpEurope, hspMaori and a group
of “unclassified Asia” in the HpyMLST database [18]).
We deduced the common core genome structure of
these 20 genomes based on the conservation of gene order
using CoreAligner [23] (Table 1). CoreAligner determines
the set of core genes among the related genomes not by
universal conservation of genes but by conservation of
neighborhood relationships between orthologous gene
pairs allowing some exceptions. As a result, CoreAligner
identified different numbers of core genes among strains
(1364-1424), which reflect deletion, duplication and split
of the core genes in the individual strains.
For phylogenetic analysis among the strains, we further
extracted 1079 well-defined core orthologous groups (OGs)
as those that were universally conserved, non-domainseparated, and with one-to-one correspondence (see
Methods). The concatenated sequence of all well-defined
core OGs resulted in a well-resolved phylogenetic tree
(Figure 1). The tree was composed of two clusters, one
containing the Japanese, Korean and Amerind strains and
the other containing the European and West African
strains. The tree strongly supported a model in which the
Japanese/Korean strains (hspEAsia) and the Amerind
strains (hspAmerind) diverged from their common ancestor, which in turn diverged from the ancestor shared by

detection of split genes, partially deleted genes and partially duplicated genes (detailed in Methods). Their features will be explained in the next five sections.

the European strains (hpEurope) long before. This conclusion is robust, as shown by the high bootstrap values of
the internal nodes, primarily because the tree is composed
of a large quantity of sequence information with approximately 1400 genes. The Japanese and Korean strains were
not separated into two clusters. PeCan4 appeared diverged
from the other four hspAmerind strains as expected from
the result of the phylogenetic analysis based on the 7
genes described above. SJM180 appeared diverged from
the other hpEurope strains in the well-defined core genebased tree.
Phylogenetic profiling to identify gene contents of
hspEAsia

To thoroughly characterize the gene contents specific to
the Japanese/Korean (hspEAsia) strains, we conducted
phylogenetic profile analysis using the DomClust

Differences in outer membrane proteins and related
proteins in the number of loci of gene families and in
alleles at each locus

One of the emerging features of the East Asian (hspEAsia) strains is the change in the number of loci of some
of the outer membrane protein (OMP) families. We
detected five OMP genes (gene families; oipA, hopMN,
sabAB, babABC and vacA-2) with the number of loci
different between the hspEAsia and hpEurope strains
(Table 2). In all but one gene family, the difference in
the number of locus was the result of gene decay in the
East Asian (hspEAsia) strains.
The notable exception was oipA, for which a secondary locus was found in hspEAsia (6/6 strains) and hspAmerind (5/5), but not in hpEurope (0/7) or hspWAfrica
(0/2). This increase of the secondary locus can be
explained by a novel DNA duplication mechanism associated with inversion [25]. The two hopMN loci in
hpEurope (7/7 strains) and hspWAfrica (1/2) were
reduced to one locus in the hspEAsia (6/6) and hspAmerind (5/5). This loss was likely caused by the same
duplication mechanism [25].
For the babABC family, the babC locus [26] was
empty in all the hpEastAsia strains (6/6 hspEAsia and 5/
5 hspAmerind) as well as from all the hspWAfrica
strains (2/2) and two hpEurope strains (B38 and B8).
This is in contrast to the presence of three loci in the
other (5/7) European strains (Table 2).
The strain J99 carried a sabA gene (jhp0662) at the
sabA locus and a sabB gene (jhp0659) at the sabB locus
[27]. All the hpEurope strains but the strain B38 (6/7)
and this hspWAfrica strain (J99) had these two loci,
whereas all the hpEastAsia strains but the strains 52 and
PeCan4 (5/6 hspEAsia and 4/5 hspAmerind) lacked
sabB locus (Table 2). These hpEastAsia strains all carried a sabA gene at the sabA locus. Genes of hpEurope
differed among strains. Three strains (HPAG1, G27 and
SJM180) carried a sabA gene at the sabA locus and a
sabB gene at the sabB locus, as J99. The strain 26695
carried a sabA gene at both the sabA and sabB loci,
whereas the strain P12 carried a sabB gene at both the
loci. The strain B8 carried a sabA gene at the sabA
locus and a hopQ gene at the sabB locus, along with
another hopQ gene at the hopQ locus.
Some of these genes (oipA, babA and babB) and homAB
genes were previously reported to diverge between the
East Asian and Western strains [13,14,17]. Difference in

g) hopQ gene. Two hopQ copies exist, one at sabB locus and the other, as in other strains, at the hopQ locus.
h) From the description of the reference [139], the sequence might not represent a complete genome, although it is deposited as a complete circular genome in
GenBank. Hence, care should be taken in interpreting the results.
Relevant information about each family from draft sequence of the Japanese strain 98-10 (NZ_ABSX01000001.1- NZ_ABSX01000051.1) [143] are as follows: oipA/
oipA-2, with at least one copy, although the exact copy number cannot be determined because of a short contig encoded only the oipA gene but not the
flanking region; hopM locus, +? (partial sequence at an end of the contig); hopN locus, not applicable because it was at an end of contigs (hopN fragment is
deposited but the sequence was partial at both ends of the contig, preventing locus assignment); babA/babB/babC, A?/?/? (babA at babA locus but partial at an
end of the contig; babB and babC loci, not applicable because they were at ends of contigs; babB sequence was partial at both ends of the contig, preventing
locus assignment); sabA/sabB, +/-; vacA-2, x; nucG split as in the other hspEAsia strains; Molybdenum-related function, x.

the number of copies of homAB genes between East Asian
and Western strains was reported [17].
For hopMN, two gene types (hopM and hopN) have
been recognized [26,27]. Phylogenetic network analysis
revealed two variable regions within the hopMN family
(region II and IV; Figure 2). Combining the two types of
two variable regions defined four main gene types, of
which two corresponded to hopM and hopN. The two
types in region II were designated m1 and m2 (m for
mid). The types in region IV were designated c1 and c2
(c for C-terminus); c3 was another variant type in region
IV, composed of parts of c1 and c2. In this designation,
previous hopM and hopN genes correspond to

hopMNm1-c1 and hopMNm2-c1, respectively. All
hpEastAsia strains except the strains 52 and PeCan4 (9/
11) carry sequence type c2 at region IV. The c3 variant is
observed in J99, PeCan4 and SJM180 (Figure 2A and 2F).
Three vacA paralogs and vacA itself were found in
26695 [28]. Those paralogs share the auto-transporter
domain at the C-terminus with vacA [28]. A large deletion
in vacA-2 (HP0289) (approximately 2400 amino acids)
was found in all the hspEAsia strains except the strain 51
(5/6) (Table 2 and Additional file 2 (= Table S1)).
It was described earlier that horA OMP locus in 26695
is composed of two open reading frames (ORFs)
(HP0078/HP0079) whereas that in J99 is composed of

one ORF (jhp0073) [27]. The horA locus in all the
hspEAsia strains shows apparent gene decay by fragmentation through various mutations (Figure 3).
Whether the genes in the other strains are functional is
not known.
A putative periplasmic endonuclease gene (nucG,
HP1382) was split in all the hspEAsia strains examined
(Table 2 and Additional file 2 (= Table S1)). Detailed
analysis revealed that the split was mediated by recombination between short similar sequences [25].
Massive decay of molybdenum-related genes for twoelectron reduction-oxidation reactions

Figure 3 Fragmentation of horA OMP gene through various
mutations in the hspEAsia strains. Genes homologous to horA in
J99 (jhp0073) are classified by the number of ORFs. Numbers
indicate coordinates on the genome sequence. Nucleotide similarity
between each pair of strains is indicated by gray parallelogram. The
state in strain 98-10 is: two ORFs.

Unexpectedly, our profiling suggested that functions
related to molybdenum (Mo) were lost specifically in the
hspEAsia strains (Table 3 and Additional file 2 (= Table
S1)). The trace element Mo is essential for nearly all
organisms [29]. After transport into the cell as molybdate,
it is incorporated into metal cofactors for specific enzymes
(molybdo-enzymes) that catalyze reduction-oxidation
(redox) reactions mediated by two-electron transfer.
In the 20 H. pylori genomes, the only gene for molybdoenzymes identified was bisC. At least one gene in each of
the three Mo-related functions, Mo transport, Mo cofactor
synthesis and a Mo-containing enzyme, decayed in all
hspEAsia strains (Table 3 and Figure 4). Detailed analysis
of nucleotide sequences revealed a mutation in 10 of 12
Mo-related genes in some of the hspEAsia strains (Table 3
and Additional file 3 (= Table S2)). The occurrence of
apparently independent multiple mutations (Additional
file 3 (= Table S2)) suggests some selection against use of
Mo in the hspEAsia strains. All other strains but P12 possessed all intact genes. The strain P12 had a truncation of
moaD (Additional file 3 (= Table S2)). Tungsten sometimes substitutes for Mo, but genes for known tungstate/
molybdate binding proteins (TupA and WtpA) were not
found in the H. pylori genomes.
The sequences in the four Japanese strains were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the primers listed in the Additional file 4 (= Table S3).
The Mo-related genes were in a list of “chronic gastritis-associated” genes [30], primarily because they are
absent from three Amerind strains from the Athabaskan
people [31]. The 5 Amerind strains analyzed in the present study are different from the three Amerind strains
in this respect. This difference could reflect the later
migration of the Athabaskans to the Americas [32].

acetyl~CoA. Two pathways connect acetyl~CoA and
acetate (Figure 5A). In anaerobic fermentation, acetyl~CoA is converted into acetate by phosphoacetyl
transferase (pta product) and acetyl kinase (ackA product) with generation of ATP (anaerobic pta-ackA
pathway) [33]. The intermediate acetyl~P, a highenergy form of phosphate, likely serves as a global signal. Although these reactions are reversible, assimilation of acetate may be irreversibly mediated by
acetyl~CoA synthetase (acoE product) by the generation of acetyl~CoA, which enters the TCA cycle to
generate energy under aerobic conditions (aerobic
acoE pathway).
It has been suggested that strain 26695 (hpEurope)
carries a mutation in pta for the former pathway
whereas strain J99 (hspWAfrica) lacks acoE for the latter [28,34]. All European strains in this study (7/7) had
at least one inactivated pta and ackA gene through a
variety of mutations (Figure 5C). Two of five Amerind
strains, PeCan4 and Cuz20, also had a mutated pta
and ackA, whereas the other 3/5 Amerind, 2/2 African,
and 3/6 hspEAsia strains had a pta and ackA intact
but had a deletion of acoE. Exceptions to such apparent incompatibility between the two pathways were
found for 3/4 of the Japanese strains (F16, F30 and
F57), which had intact genes for both pathways (Figure
5BCD). The sequences in the four Japanese strains
were confirmed (see Methods and Additional file 4 (=
Table S3)).

A gene for an amino acid utilization

An ortholog of jhp0585 in J99 is absent from 26695 [2].
An ortholog is present in the six other hpEurope strains
and both hspWAfrica strains, but absent from all
hpEastAsia strains (hspEAsia and hspAmerind) (Additional file 2 (= Table S1)). It encodes a homolog of 3hydroxy-isobutyrate dehydrogenase and the related betahydroxyacid dehydrogenase (COG2084). The 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase degrades the branched-chain
amino acid valine. H. pylori requires branched amino
acids for growth. It is not known what the substrates or
products of reactions catalyzed by this gene product are,
or the biological relevance of its distribution.
Gene contents unique to other groups

Phylogenetic profiling involving four groups (6 hspEAsia, 5 hspAmerind, 7 hpEurope, and 2 hspWAfrica
strains) (Additional file 2 (= Table S1), second sheet)
revealed the following group-specific genes:
(i) tas (HP1193) for aldo-ketoreductase was present in
all hpEurope strains except one (HPAG1) and one
hspWAfrica strain (J99), but was absent from all hpEastAsia strains (hspEAsia and hspAmerind). Aldo-keto
reductases (AKRs) constitute a large protein superfamily
of mainly NAD(P)-dependent oxidoreductases involved
in carbonyl metabolism [35]. This gene is fragmented in
H. acinonychis strain Sheeba [36].
(ii) homB encoding an outer membrane protein was
present in all but two (B8 and SJM180) hpEurope

agreement with an earlier study [17].
(iii) trl was detected in all hpEastAsia (hspEAsia and
hspAmerind) strains and 2/7 hpEurope strains (26695
and HPAG1). It is present between tRNA(Gly) and
tRNA(Leu), and co-transcribed with tRNA(Gly) [37]. It
is found in roughly half the clinical isolates in Ireland
[37]. Its homologs are present at two loci in 26695
[38].

(iv) A part of xseA for Exonuclease VII large subunit
was duplicated in all the hspAmerind strains but the
strain PeCan4. Escherichia coli exonuclease VII
degrades single-stranded DNA and contributes to
DNA damage repair and methyl-directed DNA mismatch repair to avoid mutagenesis [39-41]. This part
of xseA was present in the neighbor of 3 other genes
in these hspAmerind strains. These 4 genes may form
a genomic island.

in H. pylori [43].

Prophage-related genomic islands and other mobile
elements

Except for the cag pathogenicity island (cagPAI), five
genomic islands (GIs) were identified in the genomes of
the four Japanese strains (Table 4, Figure 6 and Figure
7). In F32, the cagPAI was flanked by a 44-bp direct
repeat, which extended the 22-bp sequence found in the
other strains (Table 4). This length of sequence identity
would allow homologous recombination [47] leading to
the excision of cagPAI flanked by the repeat.
A GI found in strain F16 lacked similarity to known
GIs of H. pylori whereas the other four GIs were homologous to transposable elements TnPZs, as recently
reported [48,49]. The GI in F16 appears to be a remnant

of a prophage inserted into a restriction-modification
system (Figure 6A). It is homologous to the 5’-half of
the Hac II prophage found in H. acinonychis Sheeba.
The F16 GI appeared to have lost its 3’-half, presumably
through deletion mediated by the inserted IS605 copy.
The GI included putative phage integrase genes
(HPF16_0475 and HPF16_0476) that suggest the mobility of this region, and a DNA primase gene
(HPF16_0468). The gene (HPF16_0469) next to the
DNA primase gene had weak sequence similarity to a
putative phage helicase gene (ORF35 of bacteriophage
phi3626, e-value 5e-5 by TBLASTN against phage
nucleotide database), which can be assumed to be the
primase-helicase system found in several bacteriophages

such as T3, T4, T7 and P4 [50]. Recently, a partial Hac
II prophage region was reported for another H. pylori
strain [51].
The other four GIs in the other three strains had
sequence similarity to TnPZs [48]. One GI in F57 was
entirely homologous to the type 1 TnPZ inserted into
the coding region for a DNA methyltransferase with 8bp target duplication (5’ ACATTCTT) (Figure 6B). The
GI in F32 appeared to have been deleted by a type 2
TnPZ (Figure 7B). Among the Korean strains, a Type 2
TnPZ was observed only in strain 51.
The plasmid in F32 (pHPF32) was similar in sequence
to known theta replication plasmids with a RepB family
(Rep_3 superfamily) replication protein and R3 iterons
[52-54].
The plasmid in F30 (pHPF30) was similar to a group
of previously characterized H. pylori plasmids such as

strain. The sequence of Type 2 TnPZ of Shi170 is deposited under the accession number [GenBank:EU807988] [48] (Table 4).

pHel4 in H. pylori [52,55]. This carries genes for microcin (7-aa peptide; MKLSYRN), MccB (microcin C7 biosynthesis protein), MccC (microcin C7 secretion
protein), MobBCD (for plasmid mobilization), a replication initiator protein, and two relaxases. When compared to other related plasmids, a substitution in mobB
and a deletion covering several small ORFs were seen.
Homologous plasmids are found in G27 (pHPG27 [56]),
P12 (HPP12 [49]), and v225d [22]. HPAG1 [30], B8
[57], PeCan4 and Sat464 carry a similar plasmid without
the MccBC genes.
Insertion sequences (ISs) were searched for in the
Japanese strains using GIB-IS [58]. An apparently intact
known IS was detected in two strains: IS607 in F16;
IS605 in F32.
Divergence of genes between the East Asian (hspEAsia)
and the European (hpEurope) strains

We systematically examined the amino acid-based phylogenetic trees of the orthologous genes (gene families)
common to the six hspEAsia genomes and the seven
hpEurope genomes. Trees of 687 OGs were selected
with genes of the hspEAsia strains forming a sub tree
with no genes of the hpEurope strains and vice versa.
Each of the orthologs was plotted according to two distance parameters: da for the hspEAsia-hpEurope divergence and db for intra-hspEAsia divergence (Figure 8A).
An hspEAsia-hpEurope divergence greater than twice
that of the well-defined core tree (da*) was seen in 47
gene families (Table 5 and 6; genes of those orthologs in
each strain are listed in Additional file 5 (= Table S4)).
These genes were further divided by the intra-hspEAsia
divergence (db) into zone 1 (lowest divergence), zone 2
(average divergence) and zone 3 (highest divergence)
(Figure 8B). Six typical trees are depicted in Figure 8C.
The cagA tree (e) (zone 3) has large da and db values
and a low db/da value, primarily because of the divergence in a C-terminal region of the ORF. This region,
including sequences known as EPIYA (Gln-Pro-Ile-TyrAla) motif, is involved in host interaction [22,59]. The
tree here is consistent with previous results [22].
This tree-based analysis effectively extracted known
pathogenesis-related genes (Table 5 and Table 6) as discussed below. The list also included several genes
related to antibiotics. Amino acid alignments (Additional file 6) located the divergent sites. The distribution
pattern of these sequences suggests a possible relationship between structure and function as detailed below
for each protein. The divergence could be related to differential activity and adaptation.
The variable da for an orthologous group is expected to
be sensitive to the presence of a member with an exceptional phylogeny. The strain B8, assigned to hpEurope in
this work (Additional file 1 (= Figure S1)), has been

Page 13 of 27

adapted to a mongolian gerbil [57]. The strain SJM180,
also assigned to hpEurope based on the tree of seven
MLST genes (Additional file 1 (= Figure S1)), clustered
with hspWAfrica strains rather than with hpEurope
strains in the tree of the well-defined core genes (Figure
1). To examine robustness of the above classification into
diverged genes, the same analysis was conducted using
the 6 hspEAsia strains and 5 hpEurope strains excluding
B8 and SJM180 (Additional file 7 (= Table S5)). These
two analyses used all the 20 strains, because we expected
inclusion of the hspAmerind and hspWAfrica strains
may provide better classification of the sub trees. In addition to these two analyses, analysis with the 6 hspEAsia
and 7 hpEurope strains or with the 6 hspEAsia and 5
hpEurope strains was carried out, which allowed assignment of a bootstrap value to the branch separating the
hspEAsia and hpEurope strains. Comparison of these 4
analyses is summarized in Additional file 7 (= Table S5).
The four sets of results agreed rather well, especially for
those genes with larger da value: 34 among the 47 genes
in Table 6 were extracted in all the 4 analyses. The bootstrap value supported the separation of hspEAsia and
hpEurope well in most cases, with the bootstrap value ≥
900 in 41 among the 47 genes.
Positively-selected amino-acid changes between the East
Asian (hspEAsia) and European (hpEurope) strains

Divergence could be adaptive or neutral. We searched
for sites where the hspEAsia-hpEurope changes in
amino acids were positively selected [60] and found that
7 of 47 genes passed the likelihood test (Table 7; red
dots in Figure 8B). These selected sites were mapped on
the coding sequences (Figure 9A). For CagA, several
sites were found outside the area of EPIYA segments.
Three-dimensional structure was available for mapping some of the selected sites for three of these genes
(Figure 9B). The three-dimensional structure of part of
VacA, the p55 fragment, is determined [61]. S793A
mapped on the surface of the p55 at its C-terminal
region (Figure 9B). Deletion of the p55 region reduces
VacA binding to cells [62], so S793A might affect cell
binding of the hspEAsia and hpEurope strains. Two
selected residues of HpaA-2 were mapped (Figure 9B).
The residue (H211) corresponding to the selected residue H174 of H. pylori MiaA mapped to the alpha helix
10 of E. coli MiaA [63,64] (Figure 9B).
Diverged genes and possible biological significance

We explored the possible biological significance of the
observed divergence in genes in Table 6 using gene and
protein properties, as summarized in Table 5.
Known virulence genes

Four genes in Table 6, cagA, vacA, hcpD and tipa, are
virulence genes.

CagA is introduced in the Background section and
discussed above in the section “Divergence of genes
between the East Asian (hspEAsia) and the European
(hpEurope) strains”. VacA is another important

virulence protein [65]. The hcpD (HP0160) is a member
of the Hcp (H. pylori cysteine-rich protein) family,
which contains repeat motifs characteristic to the eukaryotic Sel1 regulatory proteins, is secreted and interacts

with the host immune systems [16]. Geographical divergence and positive selection for amino acid changes in
this family, including HcpD, are reported [16]. HP0596
encodes tumor necrosis factor alpha-inducing protein
(Tipa), a DNA-binding protein [66]. This enters the gastric cells and induces TNF-alpha, an essential cytokine
for tumor promotion.
The cagA gene is discussed above in the section
“Divergence of genes between the East Asian (hspEAsia)
and the European (hpEurope) strains”. The vacA gene
showed a qualitatively similar pattern of intra-hspEAsia
divergence and overall divergence as cagA (Figure 8C
(d)). The overall tree pattern was consistent with previous studies (for review, see [67]). Intra-hspEAsia divergence was large for hcpD. Positively-selected residues of
cagA and vacA are described above.
Outer membrane proteins

Nine genes in Table 6 are outer membrane protein
genes (Table 5).
The vacA gene is discussed above. vacA-4 is a vacA
paralog. The hpaA-2 is of unknown function [68], but is
a paralog of hpaA [27] which is essential for adhesion
[69]. The homA/B genes are homologs of homC and
known to have diverse copy number and genomic localization in Western and East Asian strains (Table 1) [17].
OipA (also known as HopH) induces IL-8 from host
cells [70]. Geographical divergence of oipA has been
reported [14].
The hpaA-2 showed a very large hspEAsia-hpEurope
divergence (the largest da value; Figure 8B and Table 6).
Intra-hspEAsia divergence was intermediate for oipA/
oipA-2 (Table 6).
The d a value (hspEAsia-hpEurope divergence) of
homC (0.0325) was larger than the threshold distance
(Table 6). Moreover, the homC genes of all hpEastAsia
and hpAfrica1 strains but the strain 52 were greatly
diverged from those of the hpEurope strains and the

strain 52: distance 0.1387 for this separation was comparable to the largest da values for hpaA-2 and cagA.
Diverged residues were clustered in a specific region.
Positively selected amino-acid changes of the putative
homC product were identified (Table 7 and Figure 9).
The hopJ and hopK genes (HP0477 and HP0923) were
similar within each strain but different between strains
[26,27]. This earlier observation, seen for 26695, J99 and
HPAG1, was confirmed with the other genomes except
for 908 and B8. This similarity of hopJ and hopK genes
in one strain is likely to be caused by concerted evolution by homologous interaction, possibly with selection.
The babA and alpA genes were not included in the
687 OGs that showed complete separation between
genes of the six hspEAsia strains and those of the seven
hpEurope strains on the phylogenetic tree. BabA binds
to Lewis b antigens [71,72]. Geographic variation of
BabA has been reported [13]. AlpAB proteins are necessary for specific adherence to human gastric tissue [73].
In the East Asian strains but not the Western strains,
AlpA activates NF-B-related pro-inflammatory signaling pathways [74].
The reason that the babA is not in Table 6 was
mainly because babA genes of the hpEurope strains B8
and SJM180 grouped together with the hspEAsia strains
(Additional file 7 (= Table S5)). The alpA in the hpEurope strain SJM180 grouped with the hspEAsia strains
(Additional file 7 (= Table S5)).
Lipopolysaccharide synthesis and Lewis antigen mimicry

Three genes in Table 6, futA, futB and HP1105 (designated here as agt), are related to lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) synthesis and Lewis antigen mimicry.
The lipopolysaccharides of H. pylori are important for
host interaction. H. pylori can express Lewis and related
antigens in the O-chains of its surface lipopolysaccharide that mimic the hosts. O-chains are commonly composed of internal Lewis X units with terminal Lewis X

or Lewis Y units or, in some strains, with additional
units of Lewis a, Lewis b, Lewis c, sialyl-Lewis X and H1 antigens, as well as blood groups A and B, producing
a mosaic of antigenic units [75]. The activity and specificity of the fucosyltransferases may vary between the two
paralogs in one strain, as well as between the orthologs
in different strains [76]. Mechanism of these changes is
phase variation involving simple repeats and longer
repeats [77,78]. Such diversity could be adaptive and
related to differences in pathogenicity [79].
The two fucosyltransferase genes (futA = HP0379,
futB = HP0651) showed large hpEurope-hspEAsia divergence (the 4th largest da value), as reported earlier [15].
Intra-hspEAsia divergence was large for them (in zone
3). HP1105 (agt) was b-1,3-N-acetyl-glucosaminyl transferase gene for LPS synthesis. Another transfereasea-

1,6-glucosyltransferase gene (HP0159 = rfaJ-1) was in
the list of 6 hspEAsia - 5 hpEurope comparison (Additional file 7 (= Table S5)).
Transport

Four genes in Table 6, sotB, secG, yajC, comH and cvpA,
are related to motility and chemotaxis.
The sotB gene was similar to genes for sugar efflux
transporters and multi-drug resistance transporters
(COG2814, TIGR00880). SecG forms the machinery for
protein translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane
[80]. YajC is a member of the preprotein translocase
machinery, SecDF-YajC. SecDF-YajC inhibits disulfide
bond formation between two SecG molecules [81].
ComH is essential for natural transformation [82]. Its
putative N-terminal secretion signal suggests that it is
either anchored in the cytoplasmic membrane or

[85]. The maf gene encodes a member of motility accessory family of flagellin-associated proteins implicated in
flagellar assembly [86]. The cheY gene (HP1067)
encodes a response regulator of a two-component signal
transduction system regulating chemotaxis [84]. CheY
does not act as a transcriptional activator. Instead, when
activated, it interacts directly with the flagellar motorswitch complex, causing a clockwise rotation of the flagella that results in cell tumbling.
Intra-hspEAsia divergence was very small for cheY
(Table 6 and Figure 8C (a)). It would be interesting to
see whether this divergence is related to differences in
chemotaxis.

is suggested to encode a membrane protein required for
colicin V production/secretion [83].
The secG homolog, mHP1255, showed divergence
focused around residues 150-160. The nucleotide
sequence AAAGAGAAG encoding Lys-Glu-Asn was
present once in hpEurope and hspWAfrica strains
whereas repeated 2 to 4 times in tandem in all hpEastAsia strains (4 in F16, 3 in Sat464, and 2 in the others).
Positively-selected amino-acid changes of the putative
sotB product were identified (Table 7). Of these, W186Y
lay at the end of a transmembrane helical region away
from the substrate tranlocation pores.
Motility and chemotaxis

Four genes in Table 6, fliT, fliK, maf and cheY, are
related to motility and chemotaxis.
The fliT product is a flagellar chaperone [84], whereas
the fliK product controls the hook length of flagella

Seven genes in Table 6, fixQ, fixS, frxA, hypD, hydE, pgl
and nuoF, are related to electron transfer.
Aerobic respiration in H. pylori has been analyzed
experimentally and by genome sequences. A cb-type
cytochrome c oxidase is the sole terminal oxidase present in H. pylori [87]. FixQ (= CcoQ) is a component of
the oxidase. The fixS gene likely encodes the cation
transport subunit of the oxidase [34]. It has been proposed that FixS plays a role in the uptake and metabolism of copper required for oxidase assembly [87].
Aerobic respiration results in production of toxic superoxide at this terminal oxidase, which is involved in bacterial death [88]. The frxA gene, NAD(P)H-flavin
oxidoreductase, is involved in redox of flavins, which are
important electron transfer mediators [89]. Reduced flavins reduce ferric complexes or iron proteins with low
redox potential. FrxA is one of the enzymes that make
H. pylori sensitive to metronidazole [90]. H. pylori is
capable of hydrogen oxidation [87]. HypD is involved in
maturation of the [NiFe] H2-uptake hydrogenase, and
catalyzes insertion and cyanation of the iron center [91].
The hydE gene is also necessary for the hydrogenase
activity [92]. The pgl gene (HP1102) encodes a 6-phosphogluconolactonase, which catalyzes the second step of
the phosphopentose pathway. This phase of the phosphopentose pathway generates reducing power in the
form of NADPH and is important in other organisms in
defense against reactive oxygen species and oxidative
stress response [93,94].
Intra-hspEAsia divergence was very small for fixQ
(Figure 8C (b), Table 5 and Table 6).
Translation

Four genes in Table 6, miaA, tilS, def, and prmA, are
important for translation.
MiaA and TilS affects translation fidelity [95-97].
MiaA isopentenyl-tRNA transferase modifies the
tRNAs that read codons starting with U to minimize
peptidyl-tRNA slippage in translation. TilS, the tRNA
(Ile2) lysidine synthetase, modifies cytidine to lysidine
(2-lysyl-cytidine) at the first anticodon of tRNA(Ile2),

Kawai et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:104
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/104

thereby switching tRNA(Ile2) from a methionine-specific to an isoleucine-specific tRNA. Def removes a formyl group from the N-terminus of a nascent
polypeptide and is a potential drug target [98]. PrmA
is a trimethyltransferase that methyates multiple residues in the N-terminal domain of ribosomal protein
L11, a universally conserved component of the large
ribosomal subunit [99].
There was evidence that divergence in miaA was
adaptive (Table 7), and the relevant amino acid residue
was mapped on the structure (Figure 9B ii), as described
above. Intra-hspEAsia divergence was not large for def
(located in zone 2), whereas large for miaA (in zone 3).
Nucleases

Four genes in Table 6, addA, rnhA, rnhB and hsdR, are
nucleases.
AddA (AdnA, PcrA) is a RecB-like helicase that promotes DNA recombination repair and survival during
colonization [100]. Upon encounter with a DNA double-strand break, E. coli RecBCD enzyme degrades nonself DNA, but repairs self DNA marked by a genomic
identification sequence through RecA-mediated homologous recombination. The identification sequence varies
among bacterial groups [101] and can be altered by a
mutation in RecBCD [102].
The rnhA and rnhB genes encode RNase HI and
RNase HII, which hydrolyze RNA hybridized to DNA.
Their biological role remains unclear, although they
affect DNA replication, repair and transcription
[103,104].
An AT-rich region of the addA gene linking the helicase domain and the nuclease domain showed an interesting divergence: the sequence AAAGAAAG(T/C)AAA
encoding Lys-Glu-Ser-Lys was repeated in tandem 2 to
8 times in the hspWAfrica and hpEurope strains but
was absent or present only once in the hspEAsia strains.
The hspAmerind strains have a single copy (4 strains)
or two copies (1 strain).
Cell division

Gene ftsA encodes an actin-like, membrane-associated
protein that interacts with the tubulin-like FtsZ protein,
helps it assemble into the Z ring, anchors it to the cytoplasmic membrane, and recruits other proteins for cell
division [105]. It is a potential drug target [106].
Amino acid

The ilvE gene (HP1468) encodes a branched-chain
amino acid aminotransferase that generates glutamic
acid from branched-chain amino acids (valine, leucine,
isoleucine) that are essential to H. pylori. We do not
know whether its divergence is related to loss of
jhp0585, encoding a branched-amino-acid dehydrogenase, in all hpEastAsia strains (see above), or whether it
is related to a possible geographical divergence in the
amino acid content of food.

Discussion
We closely compared complete genome sequences
through phylogenetic profiling, phylogenetic tree construction, and nucleotide sequence analysis. The results
distinguished decaying from intact genes and revealed
drastic evolutionary changes within the H. pylori species.
Our results clearly define the H. pylori East Asian lineage as distinct at the genome level from the African,
European or Amerind lineages (Table 2). The East
Asian lineage consists of Japanese and Korean genomes
and corresponds to hspEAsia in the phylogenetic tree of
the concatenated seven genes used for multi-locus
sequence typing. The hspEAsia and hspAmerind
lineages form a phylogenetic group hpEastAsia. The outstanding differences are in proteins related to: (i) hostinteraction; (ii) electron transfer and redox metabolism;
and (iii) translation fidelity.
Host-interaction proteins

Many of the virulence factors show wide divergence
between hspEAsia and hpEurope, most likely because of
co-evolution with the host. We anticipate that the list of
well-diverged genes (Table 6) is enriched for host-interaction and potential virulence genes. We detected positively-selected amino-acid changes in two virulence
factors: cagA and vacA (Table 7).
Many OMP families showed loss of one of their resident loci (hopMN, babABC, sabAB), whereas one family
(oipA) showed duplication of its locus. Some OMP
genes showed internal deletions (vacA-2) or interallelic
homologous recombination (hopMN). A group-specific
repertoire was seen for other OMP genes (homB, hopZ
and hopQ), for other criteria. We also found substantial
hspEAsia-hpEurope divergence in many OMPs (Table
5). The OMPs play important roles in host interaction
such as adhesion to the host cells and induction of
immune responses [26]. For example, OipA induces IL8 from host cells [70]. Systematic decay of OMP genes
occurred during adaptation of H. pylori to a new host of
large felines, generating the new species of H. acinonychis [36]. Hence, the above OMP changes might reflect
selection and/or fine regulation in host interaction, and
more specifically, may help avoid the host immune system. At least two OMPs show evidence for positive
selection (Table 7). We do not yet know whether these
OMP changes are related to immune response or adhesin activity.
Lewis antigen mimicry is important for gastric colonization and adhesion. The mimicry affects innate
immune recognition, inflammatory response, and T-cell
polarization. Long-term infection by H. pylori might
induce autoreactive anti-Lewis antigen antibodies [107].
Divergence in transferase genes for LPS biosynthesis
may have resulted from co-evolution with the host

Kawai et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:104
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/104

immune system and could be related to changes in
Lewis antigens in human populations. For example, the
Le(a+b+) phenotype is almost absent in Caucasian persons whereas it occurs with a higher frequency in the
Asian population [108]. This might be related to differences in pathogenicity and adaptation [109].
Changes in transporter genes, the loss of a putative
amino acid utilization gene, divergence in a branched
chain amino acid metabolism gene, differences in acetate metabolism genes, and divergence in motility and
chemotaxis genes could also be related to host interaction, because these are related to the stomach environment. An interesting question is if these changes are
related to variation in human diets.
Electron transfer

Several key electron transfer components were diverged
between hspEAsia and hpEurope. The multiple and
drastic changes in redox metabolism were unexpected.
The systematic decay of all Mo-related genes through
mutations in all (6/6) hspEAsia strains was the most
striking. We do not know whether our findings reflect
the biased environmental occurrence of Mo or the dietary habits of human populations. The richest sources of
Mo include legumes, cereal grains (and baked products),
leafy vegetables, milk, beans, liver, and kidney, whereas
fruits, stem and root vegetables, and muscle meats are
poor Mo sources [110].
The BisC homolog, the only molybdoenzyme found in
the H. pylori genome, is similar to a number of periplasmic reductases for alternative oxidants such as dimethylsulfoxide or trimethylamine N-oxide [87]. Western
strains of H. pylori might be able to use N- and/or Soxide as an electron acceptor in energy metabolism in
addition to oxygen and fumarate. One hypothesis about
decay of the Mo-related genes is that this anaerobic
electron transport system became maladaptive in the
East Asian lineage. One possibility is the radical reaction
mediated by MoaA in molybdopterin synthesis is dangerous in the presence of oxygen. This could explain the
observed changes in oxidative phosphorylation and acetate metabolism.
A candidate for the BisC substrate is an oxidized form
of methionine, free or within a protein. Methionine is
sensitive to oxidation, which converts it to a racemic
mixture of methionine-S-sulfoxide (Met-S-SO) and
methionine-R-sulfoxide (Met-R-SO) [111]. The reductive
repair of oxidized methionine residues performed by
methionine sulfoxide reductase is important in many
pathogenic bacteria in general, and specifically for H.
pylori to maintain persistent stomach colonization
[112,113]. H. pylori methionine sulfoxide reductase
(Msr, HP0224 product) is induced under oxidative stress
control and can repair methionine-R-sulfoxide but not

Page 20 of 27

the S isomer, even though it is a fusion of an R-specific
and an S-specific enzyme [114]. BisC from other bacteria can reduce and repair the S but not the R form
[111].
If the sole function of BisC is to repair methionine-Ssulfoxide, another means to repair methionine-S-sulfoxide may have appeared in the East Asian H. pylori, for
example by higher expression of Msr. In this case, BisC
may have been inactivated because Mo-related reactions
were no longer necessary. The substitution by a DNA
element downstream of the msr gene in the hspEAsia
strains (5/6, all but strain 52) could be involved in the
hypothesized methionine-S-sulfoxide repair activity of
its product.
Another possibility is decrease of oxidative stress generating methionine-S-sulfoxide in the East Asian H.
pylori. Oxidative stress is induced by acid exposure, and
msr is among the oxidative stress genes induced by acid
[115]. H. pylori infection has different effects on acid
secretion in Europe and Asia [116]. In Europe, antralpredominant gastritis with increased acid secretion is
frequent, whereas in Asia, pan-gastritis and subsequent
atrophic gastritis with decreased acid secretion are common. The decrease in acid experienced by East Asian H.
pylori lineages may have decreased their methionine-Ssulfoxide and made its repair by BisC unnecessary.
Downregulation of some of the Mo-related genes in a
European strain under acidic conditions may be related
to their decay [30]. Downregulation may occur to avoid
the possible toxic effects of Mo metabolism under conditions of acid adaptation.
Taken together, our results led us to predict that the
East Asian H. pylori strains are different from the European strains in electron transfer reactions and
responses to oxygen and acid. Possibly related to this
alteration in redox is the presence of the two acetaterelated pathways in 3 out of 4 Japanese strains. These
are expected to be able to switch from acetate fermentation to acetate utilization under aerobic conditions, as
seen for E. coli [117]. The European strains, some of the
hspAmerind strains, and the other hspEAsia strains may
be regarded as mutants that lack the pta-ackA pathway
and the supposedly important acetyl~P signal. Global
effects of these defects on chemotaxis, nitrogen and
phosphate assimilation, osmo-regulation, flagellar biogenesis, biofilm development, and pathogenicity are
expected, based on the various phenotypes of E. coli
strains defective in these genes [33].
Translation fidelity

Translational proteins also diverged between hpEurope
and hspEAsia strains. MiaA (tRNA delta(2)-isopentenylpyrophosphate transferase) and TilS (tRNA lysidine
synthetase) affect accuracy in elongation. The amino-

Kawai et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:104
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/104

acid change in MiaA turned out to be adaptive (Table
7). TilS affects translation efficiency at various stages.
Ambiguity in translation is proposed to be important in
the evolution of novel proteins by generating phenotypic
and genetic diversity in the proteome for selection
[118]. This role of ambiguity is similar to the evolutionary role of genome-wide modulation of mutation rates
by genes such as mutS [119].
Implications for medicine

East Asian (Japanese/Korean) H. pylori appear to be
quite different from European H. pylori. Our results
provide a solid starting point for understanding the
biology, host interaction, and pathogenesis of the East
Asian H. pylori, which in most previous works were
inferred from a European strain. Divergences included
virulence, cell surface-related, and drug target genes.
These results will affect our strategy in developing
effective therapies and drugs. Questions raised by our
findings include whether East Asian VacA (Figure 9B)
interacts with host cells in the same way as European
VacA.
The diverged gene frxA is associated with resistance to
antibiotics metronidazole [120], which is frequently used
in H. pylori eradication. The divergence in the frxA
could affect resistance to this group of drugs in various
ways. More generally, if redox metabolism differs
between hspEAsia and hpEurope strains, the same drug
might produce different effects, depending on intra-bacterial redox reactions.
The diverged genes included two potential drug targets (def and ftsA), so drugs that target these proteins
may have different effects in East Asian and European
strains. We do not know, for example, whether anti-H.
pylori drugs designed from structure of European Def
[98] will be as effective against East Asian H. pylori.
Remaining questions

Clearly, many studies are needed to answer these and
other questions raised by the genomics results presented
here. Phylogenetic analysis in the present study used
OGs where genes of hspEAsia were clustered separately
from those of hpEurope. Some genes do not share this
topology, as suggested above for acoE deletion and
hopMN recombination. We plan to study the distortion
in the tree. We focused on differences between a limited numbers of strains from each group. However,
there are variations within East Asian strains (Table 5).
Further experimental examination of the divergence
within hspEAsia, and between hspEAsia and the other
strains are necessary to understand their divergence in
detail. Such examination might reveal complexity in
evolution and will be the subject of a separate study.
The mechanisms underlying the variation, such as

Page 21 of 27

mutations and rearrangements, will be a subject of a
separate study [25].

Conclusions
Taking advantage of the extreme genome plasticity of H.
pylori, we demonstrated how drastically a genome can
change during evolution within a species. Our results
revealed drastic changes in proteins for host interaction
and electron transfer and suggested their importance in
adaptive evolution. These results define the H. pylori
East Asian and Western lineages at the genome level,
enhance our understanding of their host interaction,
and contribute to the design of effective drugs and
therapies. The approach of fine comparative analysis of
closely-related multiple genomes may reveal subtle but
important evolutionary changes in other populations.
Methods
H. pylori culture

Four strains were isolated from patients with diffuse
type gastric cancer, intestinal type gastric cancer, duodenal ulcer, and gastritis (F57 [121], F32, F30 and F16
[122]). The ABO blood groups of the hosts were: F57,
B; F32, A; F30, O; F16, B. Studies were performed
according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and consent obtained from each individual after a
full description of the nature and protocol of the study.
Gastric biopsy specimens from each patient were
inoculated onto a trypticase soy agar (TSA)-II/5% sheep
blood plate and cultured under microaerobic conditions
(O2, 5%; CO2, 15%; N2, 80%) at 37°C for 5 days. A single
colony was picked from each primary culture plate,
inoculated onto a fresh TSA-II plate, and cultured
under the conditions described above. A few colonies
were picked from each plate and transferred into 20 ml
of Brucella broth liquid culture medium containing 10%
fetal calf serum, and cultured for 3 days under the conditions as described above. A part of the liquid culture
sample was stored at -80°C in 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 20% glycerol. DNA from
each H. pylori isolate was extracted from the culture
pellet by the protease/phenol-chloroform method, suspended in 300 μl of TE buffer (10 mM Tris HCl, 1 mM
EDTA) and stored at 4°C for PCR analysis and nucleotide sequencing.
Genome sequencing

The genome sequences of H. pylori strains F16, F30, F32
and F57 were determined by a whole-genome shotgun
strategy. We constructed small-insert (2 kb) and largeinsert (10 kb) plasmid libraries from genomic DNA, and
sequenced both ends of the clones to obtain 26,112 (F16
and F57), 30,720 (F30) and 33,792 (F32) sequences
using ABI 3730xl sequencers (Applied Biosystems), with

Kawai et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:104
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/104

coverage of 10.0 (F16)-, 11.5 (F30)-, 12.7 (F32)- and 10.0
(F57)-fold. Sequence reads were assembled with the
Phred-Phrap-Consed program, and gaps were closed by
direct sequencing of clones that spanned the gaps or
with PCR products amplified using oligonucleotide primers designed against the ends of neighboring contigs.
The overall accuracy of the finished sequence was estimated to have an error rate of less than 1 per 10,000
bases (Phrap score of ≥40). Sequences of the molybdenum-related genes and the genes in the acetate pathway
of the four Japanese strains were verified by resequencing PCR fragments directly amplified from genomic
DNA (primers are in Additional file 4 (= Table S3)).
The genome sequences of other strains were obtained
from National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) [123]. Accession numbers are in Table 1.
Gene finding and annotation

We used the same protocol to identify genes in the four
new strains and 16 other complete genomes (Table 1;
gene assignment differences are in Additional file 8 (=
Table 6)).
Protein-coding genes were identified by integrating
predictions from programs GeneMarkS [124] and
GLIMMER3 [125]. All ORFs longer than 10 amino acids
were searched using BLASTP [126] against two databases, one composed of genes of 6 H. pylori genomes in
RefSeq database at NCBI ("close” database), and the
other composed of genes of 300 complete prokaryote
genomes (one genome per one genus) available at the
end of 2008, except for those in the Helicobacter genus
("distant” database). When the predicted start position
differed in GeneMarkS and GLIMMER3, assignments
were made by consensus of hits, with consensus against
the “distant” database taking priority over the “close”
one. The consensus start position among bidirectional
best hits with 50% or more amino acid sequence identity
for each matched region for each genome pair was
determined by majority rule. Overlap of genes was
resolved by comparing the results from four prediction
programs. Genes encoding fewer than 100 amino acids
and predicted only by Glimmer3 were dropped except
for the microcin gene.
tRNA genes were detected using tRNAscan-SE [127].
rRNA genes were identified based on sequence conservation. Putative replication origins were predicted by
GC-skew (window size 500 bp, window shift 250 bp).
Core genome analysis

The common core structure conserved among 20 H.
pylori genomes was identified based on conservation of
gene order among orthologs using the CoreAligner
program [23] implemented in the RECOG system.
Briefly, CoreAligner identifies the genomic core of the

Page 22 of 27

input genomes by taking the longest path of the neighborhood graph that consists of conserved neighborhood gene pairs, which are defined as pairs of OGs
that are within a neighborhood of 20 genes in at least
half of the genomes. For this analysis, we used as input
a set of OGs generated by the DomClust program [24]
(see “Phylogenetic profile analysis” section below for
details about identification of OGs by DomClust).
Absence of a gene in some genomes (at least half of
the genomes) in each OGs among the core is allowed.
In addition, as identified OGs are at the domain level,
if a counterpart of a gene in one genome is split in
another genome, different number of genes can participate in the OGs in different genomes. Thus, the number of core genes in each genome can vary. Still, the
numbers of core genes varied less (1364-1424; SD =
13.5) than the total number of genes among the strains
(1465-1593; SD = 33.9) (Table 1). Among those core
OGs, 1079 OGs were universally conserved (conserved
in the all genomes), non-domain-separated, with oneto-one correspondence, and designated “well-defined
core OGs”. Those 1079 OGs were used for phylogenetic analysis (Figure 1). Nucleotide sequences of
genes in well-defined core OGs were aligned by the
Mafft program [128], from which conserved blocks
were extracted by the Gblocks program [129].
Phylogenetic profile analysis

Phylogenetic profiling was carried out using the set of
OGs generated by DomClust [24]. We identified OGs
with East Asian-specific features as those whose phylogenetic profiles were highly correlated to the template
pattern (taking 1 for hspEAsia and 0 for hpEurope). The
DomClust clustering program can identify OGs at the
domain level, and was used to identify genes truncated
in particular strains. Clustering was performed based on
PAM (point accepted mutation) distance rather than
score to ensure proper evaluation of evolutionary distances, even if one gene was truncated; in the latter
case, scores may underestimate evolutionary relatedness.
To clarify differences in gene-splitting patterns among
strains, we did not use DomClust options to suppress
domain splitting.
To identify genes with characteristic patterns of
hspEAsia strains, we constructed a phylogenetic profile
for each OG as a vector of examined property values (e.
g., number of domains or number of duplications). For
surveying patterns of gene splitting and deletion, a phylogenetic profile was constructed for each OG using the
number of domains for each gene that resulted from the
clustering. For surveying patterns of gene duplication, a
phylogenetic profile was constructed using the number
of duplicated genes (in-paralogs). To find OGs with a
characteristic hspEAsia pattern, equality of the medians

Kawai et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:104
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/104

among different populations was tested by KruskalWallis test. Tests between East Asian and European
strains used the six hspEAsia strains and the seven
hpEurope strains. Tests among four subpopulations
used six hspEAsia, five hspAmerind, seven hpEurope,
and two hspWAfrica strains.
Phylogenetic network analysis of the hopM/N family
was carried out using NeighborNet [130] implemented
on SpritsTree [131].
Analyses of molybdenum-related genes

H. pylori protein sequences were searched against the
CDD conserved protein domain database, by RPSBLAST [132]. Protein families extracted from the search
results for Mo-cofactor synthesis or binding domain
were: PF03404 (Mo-co_dimer), PF03205 (MobB),
PF02738 (Ald_Xan_dh_C2), PF01568 (Molydop_binding), PF02730 (AFOR_N), PF02597 (ThiS), PF03454
(MoeA_C), PF06463 (Mob_synth_C), PF03453 (Moe
A_N), PF01315 (Ald_Xan_dh_C), PF01493 (GXGXG),
PF02579 (Nitro_FeMo-Co, PF01967 (MoaC), PF03459
(TOBE), PF02391 (MoaE), PF00384 (Molybdopterin),
PF04879 (Molybdop_Fe4S4), PF02665 (Nitrate_red_gam), PF00174 (Oxidored_molyb), PF00994 (MoCF_biosynth), PF03473 (MOSC), PF02625 (XdhC_CoxI),
PF01314 (AFOR_C), PF01547 (SBP_bac_1) (pfam name
in parentheses). Homologs of two molybdoproteins
[133] that were not detected in the above protein
families were absent in the H. pylori genomes.
bisC was the only molybdoenzyme gene in the 20 H.
pylori genomes with detected domains PF01568 (Molydop_binding) and PF00384 (Molybdopterin). A multidomain TIGR00509 (bisC_fam) was also detected in bisC.
Analyses of horizontally transferred regions

GIs were detected by searching for regions that fulfilled
the conditions of: (i) longer than 5 kb; (ii) continuous
ORFs not perfectly conserved in all 20 H. pylori strains;
and (iii) whole regions assumed as extrinsic by Alien
Hunter [134]. Counterparts of detected GIs in Amerind
strains were previously reported as TnPZ [48,49].
Genes with a large distance between East Asian and
European strains

OGs diverged between six hspEAsia and seven hpEurope strains were screened based on two values related
to their phylogenetic tree. The da value was the distance
between the last common ancestral (LCA) node of
hspEAsia and the LCA node of hpEurope. The db value
was the average distance of hspEAsia from its LCA
node. OGs with hspEAsia-diverged genes were screened
by introducing the following conditions (with hspAmerind omitted): (i) OGs in which all the hspEAsia genes of
the OG formed a sub tree without any hpEurope genes

Page 23 of 27

in the phylogenetic tree; (ii) OGs universally conserved
(not less than 12 of the 13 genomes; not less than 10
among 11 genomes for comparison of 6 hspEAsia and 5
hpEurope strains in Additional file 7 (= Table S5)); (iii)
genes with no domain fusion/fission event among the
13 genomes (within ± 20% of the mean length of the
OG, measured in amino acid residues); (iv) d a value
greater than twice the d a value of the concatenated
well-defined core tree (of amino-acid sequences)
(denoted as d a *; with the resulting cutoff of d a >
0.02324; 1079 OGs; see “core genome analysis” section
above). Among 1248 OGs that satisfied the criteria (ii)
and (iii), 692 OGs satisfied the criteria (i), that is, complete separation of genes of hspEAsia from those of
hpEurope. The db* ± sd values in logarithmic scale, corresponding to 0.00550 and 0.0231 (db* = 0.01128) in the
original scale, were used as threshold values for the
three zones (N = 687; five OGs with d b = 0 were
excluded from 692 OGs satisfying the above criteria (i)(iii)).
Amino acid sequences of the genes were aligned by
the einsi command of the MAFFT program [128], from
which a neighbor-joining tree was constructed by the
ClustalW program [135].
A branch-site likelihood ratio test of positive selection
was carried out using PAML [60] based on the multiple
alignment by the einsi command of MAFFT [128]. Only
residues aligned at the same site by the einsi command
and by PRANK (with codon option) [136] were considered. Positively-selected residues were mapped on the
p55 structure of VacA using PyMol).
Statistics

The equality of means for phylogenetic profiling
between East Asian and European strains was tested by
Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance by ranks, a
non-parametric method for testing equality of population medians among groups. The tests were conducted
using the R statistics package [137].
