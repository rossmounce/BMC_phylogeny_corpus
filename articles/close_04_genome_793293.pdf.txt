Abstract
Background: Heterocellular hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH) is a common
multifactorial trait characterized by a modest increase of fetal hemoglobin levels in adults. We
previously localized a Quantitative Trait Locus for HPFH in an extensive Asian-Indian kindred to
chromosome 6q23. As part of the strategy of positional cloning and a means towards identification
of the specific genetic alteration in this family, a thorough annotation of the candidate interval based
on a strategy of in silico / wet biology approach with comparative genomics was conducted.
Results: The ~1.5 Mb candidate region was shown to contain five protein-coding genes. We
discovered a very large uncharacterized gene containing WD40 and SH3 domains (AHI1), and
extended the annotation of four previously characterized genes (MYB, ALDH8A1, HBS1L and
PDE7B). We also identified several genes that do not appear to be protein coding, and generated
17 kb of novel transcript sequence data from re-sequencing 97 EST clones.
Conclusion: Detailed and thorough annotation of this 1.5 Mb interval in 6q confirms a high level
of aberrant transcripts in testicular tissue. The candidate interval was shown to exhibit an
extraordinary level of alternate splicing – 19 transcripts were identified for the 5 protein coding
genes, but it appears that a significant portion (14/19) of these alternate transcripts did not have an
open reading frame, hence their functional role is questionable. These transcripts may result from
aberrant rather than regulated splicing.

Background
The hemoglobinopathies represent the most common
category of clinically significant inherited disorders, causing a huge burden on global health [1]. Despite the appar-

ently simple Mendelian inheritance of α- and βthalassemia and sickle cell disease (SCD), a significant
variation in clinical severity is observed. It is now evident
that the genetic background of affected individuals

Page 1 of 14

BMC Genomics 2004, 5

imparts a substantial portion of the variation in clinical
phenotype [2]. In particular, a number of studies have
shown that an increased fetal hemoglobin (HbF; α2γ2)
response in conjunction with either sickle cell disease or
β-thalassemia has an ameliorating effect on the clinical
disease [3,4]. This has prompted intensive investigations
on γ-globin gene regulation, the outcome of which may
provide insights for the therapeutic augmentation of HbF
as treatment for the β-hemoglobinopathies.
All normal adults continue to synthesize small quantities
of HbF; the residual amounts of HbF are restricted to a
subset of erythrocytes termed F cells [5]. Surveys have
shown that the distribution of HbF in adults is continuous
and varies considerably (>20 fold) between individuals
[6]. The heritability of FC levels has been estimated to be
0.89 in the European population [7]. Whilst environmental influences – including age [8] and sex [8,9] – account
for a proportion of this variation, family studies have
demonstrated a strong genetic component of this variation [6]. These genetic influences include DNA sequence
variants in-cis to the β-globin complex such as the C→T
single base substitution at position -158 in the promoter
of the Gγ-globin gene (referred to as the Xmn1-Gγ site
[7,10]). The major proportion of the variance in HbF,
however, is due to trans-acting factors [11]. About 10–
15% of individuals have levels of HbF > 1% and up to 5%
of total hemoglobin. Such individuals with modest
increases in HbF are considered to have heterocellular
HPFH in which there is uneven distribution of HbF
among the erythrocytes (hence heterocellular) [12]. It is
likely that several quantitative Trail Loci (QTLs) contribute to the HbF levels in heterocellular HPFH, unlike the
rare pancellular HPFHs which are inherited in a Mendelian fashion as alleles of the β-globin complex, caused

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/33

either by extensive deletions of the β-globin cluster or
point mutations in the γ-globin promoter [12]. Heterozygotes for such pancellular HPFHs have a clearly defined
phenotype of substantially increased HbF levels of 10–
35% which is homogenously distributed among the red
blood cells (hence 'pancellular').
Our group mapped a QTL for heterocellular HPFH in a
very large Asian-Indian pedigree [13,14]. The kindred was
initially identified through the proband who – despite
being homozygous for β°-thalassemia, with a complete
absence of adult hemoglobin (HbA; α2β2) – had an
extremely mild clinical phenotype which was the result of
substantially raised HbF expression. The family was later
characterized as a 210 member Asian-Indian kindred with
heterocellular HPFH, β-thalassemia and α-thalassemia
segregating through seven generations [15]. A genomewide linkage search was performed on this family, leading
to a significant linkage (Lod score = 12.4) between the
chromosomal region 6q22.3-q24 and increased HbF
expression [14,15]. In collaboration with the Sanger Centre, Cambridge, we assisted in the construction of a highdensity BAC/PAC physical map covering the candidate
interval [16]. The sequence for this candidate interval was
subsequently produced by the Human Genome Mapping
Project [17]. This paper describes a detailed annotation of
the 1.5 Mb candidate interval, which was subsequently
used to direct our mutation analysis studies in the AsianIndian family.

Results
The annotated candidate interval is represented pictorially
in Figure 1, detailing the approximate location of the five
protein-coding genes and four RNA genes.

Characterization of the candidate interval
The candidate interval is localized to the cytogenetic "Gband" 6q23.2 on chromosome 6, comprising 1571770 bp
(~1.5 Mb) of DNA defined by the markers D6S270
(Z16636) and DbAD6 (AJ606363). The extent of the candidate interval was defined by haplotype analysis that has
been previously published [16], and that has been further
refined to reduce the candidate interval. The telomeric
boundary is now defined by the novel microsatellite
marker DbAD6 (data not shown). This marker is within
the 1st intron of the gene PDE7B, such that only the promoter and exon 1 of this gene remain within the candidate interval. The GC content of the candidate region is
approximately 0.39 and the repeat content is approximately 44%, both of which are less than the genome average (0.41 and 50%, respectively). High GC and repeat
content are positively associated with gene density [17],
which suggests that the candidate interval is gene poor, an
assumption which proved to be correct. The candidate
interval was subjected to analysis for repetitive RNA
encoding gene families. tRNAscan-SE [18] revealed no evidence for tRNA genes within the candidate interval, and
no rRNA or micro RNA genes were identified by means of
homology searches.
Genes
All genes were thoroughly annotated using a strategy
which was based on manual inspection of public data
sources to inform laboratory experiments. This combined
a mixture of EST driven transcript identification, gene prediction and comparative genomics to identify transcripts.
RT-PCR was used to confirm the existence of any putative
transcripts deriving from these methods. Finally, where
necessary, RACE (Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends) was
then used to obtain full-length cDNA for previously unidentified transcripts. This thorough annotation strategy
was performed in an attempt to exhaustively clone and
characterize all the transcripts within the candidate interval, including those that may be novel, expressed at a lowlevel or restricted to a specific tissue. The results of this
analysis is described below, initially on a gene-by-gene
basis, followed by the overall results for EST and comparative approaches.
MYB
MYB is a well-characterized nuclear transcription factor,
expressed to some degree in most major hematopoietic
lineages (for review see [19]). The genomic locus of MYB
is comprised of 15 exons spread over approximately 48.5
Kb in the center of the candidate interval [20]. This locus
expresses a 3.2 Kb mRNA, with the major human product
of MYB being a 636AA, 80 kDa protein. Various putative
splice variants of MYB have been reported in the literature
[20-23], although other than the "exon 9A" splice variant
[21,24,25], their existence is controversial. This exon 9A

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/33

splice variant produces a larger 89 kDa protein which is
the result of an addition of 363 bp between exons 9 and
10 (exon 9A); with this variant representing less than 10–
20% of the total MYB protein in all cell types examined
thus far. Within this work, the exon 9A splice variant is
referred to as "Exon 9Aii", due to the confusion in the literature between exon 9A (exon 9Aii) and a different exon
9A splice variant annotated on the sequence U22376
(referred to herein as exon 9Ai)
Further to the characterized exon 9Aii alternate transcript,
several other MYB transcripts have been reported in the
literature and public DNA databases. As a means to comprehensively annotating the gene, we tested the existence
of all suggested putative splice variants of MYB by RTPCR. These splice variants were suggested from a number
of different resources and are detailed in table 1. We
designed primers to test the existence of these transcripts
by RT-PCR such that PCR products spanned an exon
boundary, with one primer in a known (major transcript
exon) and the other primer positioned in a putative alternate exon. PCR results for all transcripts that showed a
positive result in a reasonable number of cycles (<35) are
shown in Figure 2. All positive PCR products were
sequenced across the splicing junctions and confirmed to
represent the expected MYB alternate splice variant.
This strategy confirmed the existence of eight MYB splice
variants including the primary transcript. Seven of these
are listed in table 1 (Exon 8', Exon 8A, Exon 9Ai, Exon
9Aii, Exon 10A, Exon 13A, and Exon 14A), and the full
sequences for each splice variant can be obtained from the
listed accession numbers. Furthermore, sequencing of the
PCR products revealed that Exon 8' (which uses an alternate splice donor in exon 8, producing a MYB exon 8
which is 9 bp smaller) and Exon 8A appear to be commonly expressed together, providing a ninth splice variant
which contains both Exon 8' and Exon 8A (AJ606321).
The arrangement of these splice variants is illustrated in
Figure 3A.
Interestingly, all the variants involved alternate splicing
events at the 3' end of the gene. This region correlates with
the transactivation and negative regulatory domains of
the gene, suggesting that different splice variants may
interact with different protein partners. Conversely, the 5'
end of the gene (relating to the DNA binding domain)
appears completely invariant. It is possible that some of
these splice variants represent low-level aberrant transcription and are of questionable biological significance.
For example, only exon 9Aii and exon 8' splice variants
contain a full protein coding region, whereas all other
alternate splice variants introduce a premature stop
codon.

The putative alternate splice variant is indicated in the 1st column, and the subsequent columns indicate lines of evidence that suggested the
existence of this splice variant. The literature references and accession numbers for previously reported splice variants are provided. Ensembl
transcripts were observed on the v.9.30a.1 (2/12/2002) Ensembl release. Gene predictions were suggested by Genscan, Fgenesh++ or Twinscan,
and conserved regions were classified as intronic sequence of >70% homology over 100 bp with the syntenic mouse region. The RT-PCR primer
sequences used to test the existence of each alternate exon are listed, followed by a column indicating whether this splice variant was detectable by
RT-PCR, and the associated PCR conditions. The final column provides the accession number of our sequences for the confirmed alternate splice
variant.

HBS1L
HBS1L was originally identified during a comparative
genome hybridization study searching for chromosomal
imbalances in pancreatic adenocarcinoma [26]. Whilst
MYB was identified as the most likely candidate oncogene
in this study, HBS1L was also discovered among the co-

amplified genes in the chromosomal region of 6q24. The
product of the HBS1L gene was shown to encode a 648AA
polypeptide, with a predicted molecular mass of around
75 kDa. Phylogenetic studies suggested that HBS1L may
be associated with translating ribosomes and aid in the

passage of the nascent polypeptide through the ribosome
channel. Alternatively, it may bring the amino-acyl-tRNA
to the ribosome [27,28].
Of the 85 EST sequences representing HBS1L, 76 confirmed the existence of the previously identified primary
transcript (NM_006620) [26]. Furthermore, our analysis
of EST data revealed the use of three alternate polyadenylation signals, of which the middle signal would appear

to be primarily utilized (producing a longer transcript
than the reference transcript NM_006620). This is evidenced by both EST data and the 3 kb product size
observed by Northern by both ourselves (data not shown)
and others [28]. The full 7162 bp cDNA, with all three
poly(A) recognition sites annotated has been submitted
(AJ459826).

EST analyses followed by EST re-sequencing (as described
in the later section) and RT-PCR revealed the existence of
an exon 4A alternate splice variant, which contained precisely the same four first exons as the major, published
HBS1L transcript. However, the transcript utilizes an alternate fifth exon "exon 4A", in which it terminates (missing
the subsequent exons 5–18 of the primary transcript).
This results in a 2800 bp cDNA (AJ459827), with the
putative translation product encoding a 667AA protein.
The exon 4A sequence contains an open reading frame
resulting in an additional 489AA which are unique to this
splice variant. However, the exon 4A protein sequence is
novel with no significant homologies, and its function is
entirely unknown. The structure of the HBS1L gene is
detailed in Figure 3C.
ALDH8A1
ALDH8A1 was originally identified using a functional
approach to identify genes responsible for 9-cis-retinal
metabolism [29]. The ALDH8A1 gene produces 2551 bp
mRNA expressed in a variety of tissues including the erythroid and bone marrow. ALDH8A1 [29] is represented by a
2551 bp cDNA (AF303134), comprising 7 exons spread
over ~30 kb. Although we found no evidence for alternate
splicing of this gene, the publication of the ALDH8A1
gene [29] discusses the existence of an alternate transcript
which skips exon 6. The structure of ALDH8A1 is detailed
in Figure 3D.
PDE7B
PDE7B [30,31] localizes to the distal (telomeric) extremity of the candidate interval, with only the promoter and
first exon of the gene localized within the candidate interval. Due to this, extensive characterization of the gene was
not performed and the gene has been thoroughly
described elsewhere [30,31].
AHI1
The novel, previously uncharacterized gene AHI1 was
originally identified through numerous EST homologies
to the corresponding genomic interval. EST data revealed
the presence of 7 transcripts, two of which were experimentally verifiable by RT-PCR. The primary transcript
(AJ459824) is a 5538 bp cDNA encoded by 28 exons
spread over nearly 215 kb of DNA around the center of the
candidate interval. This represents a huge gene (the average genomic extent is around 14 kb). A predicted CpG
island exists which overlaps exon 1 of the gene. The
encoded polypeptide is a 1197 amino acid protein with a
predicted molecular weight of ~136 kDa. It contains six Gprotein WD40 repeats in the region of exons 13–18 and a
Src-homology 3 (SH3) domain in the region of exon 23
and 24. The N-terminus of the protein is novel, with the
only significant homolog being an uncharacterized
mouse gene (BAB24355). The existence of WD40 repeats

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/33

and an SH3 domain suggests that AJ459824 interacts with
other proteins, possibly in the formation of large, transient multiprotein complexes. The diverse cellular roles of
SH3 and WD-repeats precludes functional assignment of
this gene.
The alternate splice variant 2 (AJ459825), which is 3654
bp, includes an alternate exon "22A" in which the transcript terminates (Figure 3B). This results in a protein containing the G-protein WD40 repeats, but missing the SH3
domain, suggesting that the two domains may function
independently. Furthermore, RT-PCR and RACE investigation revealed a third gene variant (AJ606362). This was
identical to the full-length transcript (AJ459824) in every
respect except that it skipped exon 2. Further to the alternate splice variants, EST data revealed the use of an alternate polyadenylation signal on the major transcript
(AJ459824).
The expression of AHI1 was investigated experimentally
and electronically. The gene would appear to be widely
expressed, with detectable expression in all tissues tested
by RT-PCR (small intestine, spleen, bone marrow, thymus, colon, testes and liver) except fetal liver (data not
shown). "Digital differential display" generated from the
source tissue of representative EST sequences [32], confirmed our experimental data, that this gene is widely
expressed in kidney, germ cell, prostate, testis, uterus,
whole embryo, brain, stomach, colon, pituitary, cervix,
ovary, ear, eye, and lung.
EST based gene finding
EST re-sequencing was employed as a strategy for garnering further information concerning putative transcripts.
As EST sequence generally represents a small part of the
entire EST clone sequence (around 200–500 bp of publicly available sequence data, compared to clone lengths
of up to and over 2 Kb), the full EST insert can be
sequenced to extend the available sequence for each putative transcript. This strategy can therefore obtain the maximum quantity of information from an existing, cheap
and readily available resource.

Strong EST homologies (greater than 95% identity over
>100 bp) were identified by BLAST search [33] against the
candidate interval sequence. By reference to the UniGene
database [34], non-redundant clusters of ESTs were identified. These ESTs were assembled into an electronic contig using the contig assembly program Sequencher
(GeneCodes). From each cluster of ESTs, the most appropriate clone (the most protruding, large insert clone) from
each unmapped end of the cluster was selected and
ordered from the IMAGE (Integrated Molecular Analysis
of Genomes and their Expression) consortium [35]. All

potentially useful EST sequences – which could provide
novel sequence information – were then sequenced.
In total, approximately 13,000 EST sequences were found
to be highly homologous to the candidate interval. However, the vast majority of these represented homology to
the five pseudogenes within the candidate interval (briefly
discussed later) and could be immediately discounted
from providing useful information. A further five EST
clusters represented the genes MYB, HBS1L, ALDH8A1,
PDE7B and AHI1, and the results of their respective EST
analysis were included earlier with reference to each gene.
After subtracting the known genes and the pseudogenes, a
total of approximately 500 ESTs localized to the candidate
interval, represented by 100 EST clusters. Of these 500
ESTs, 104 were deemed suitable for full-insert sequencing
(based on insert size and position in EST contig; listed in
table 3 (see additional file 1). Of the 104 sequenced ESTs,
7 contained a wrong, unexpected insert. The remaining 97
clones were sequenced to produce a total of 17 Kb of novel
sequence data (i.e. potential transcript sequence data
which was not previously available in any public database
repository), confirming that EST re-sequencing is a viable
method for generating novel transcript information. Furthermore, in six instances the novel EST sequence data
revealed previously unidentified exons of a transcript.
Due to the large numbers of artifacts present in EST libraries (e.g. partially spliced RNA species, chimeras and contamination from various sources including genomic DNA
[36-39]), we concentrated efforts on those EST transcripts

that both exhibited exon structure and were completely
homologous to the candidate interval. The uncharacterized EST clusters chiefly represented probable genomic
contamination, with a smaller number representing
chimeras.
This revealed 16 spliced, non-chimeric EST clusters, which
were tested for expression by RT-PCR against a panel of
cDNA tissues (fetal liver, erythroid, Lymphoblastoid cell
line, spleen, stomach, thymus, small intestine, colon,
bone marrow, testes and plasmid DNA from the cognate
EST as a positive control). RT-PCR primers were designed
such that the PCR product spanned an exon boundary, so
that amplification from any contaminating genomic DNA
could be eliminated. This experimentally verified the
expression of four EST clusters.
To obtain full-length transcripts for these experimentally
verified genes, we utilized the Clontech SMART-RACE system (primers sequences listed in the materials and methods). This produced full-length transcript information on
the four genes, and revealed 11 splice variants of these
genes. Table 3 lists the sizes, accession numbers and cDNA
tissues that revealed detectable expression of these
transcripts.
Analysis of these EST transcripts revealed that none contained a full-length open reading frame (see table 2), and
there were no significant homologies to known genes.
Therefore it is suggested that these transcripts either
encode functional RNAs or represent aberrant transcription. We should add that the evidence of many of these

The genes have been named 1–4 for the purposes of this paper, with each gene being subdivided into separate transcripts (e.g. splice variants). The
"Expression verified in" column lists which tissues we have verified the expression of the transcripts by RT-PCR (from a cDNA panel including Fetal
Liver, Erythroid, Lymphoblastoid cell line, Spleen, Stomach, Thymus, Small Intestine, Colon, Bone Marrow, Placenta and Testes). The final column
lists the longest Open Reading Frame identified in each cDNA, defined as the longest uninterrupted stretch between a methionine and a stop
codon.

transcripts was purely derived from testes, a tissue previously associated with unusual transcripts that appear to be
non-functional or aberrant versions of functioning genes
[40,41]. The fact that a number of recent publications
[42,43] have described testis-specific transcripts (some
lacking ORFs) without mentioning the possibility of aberrant transcripts suggests that this area is worthy of further
investigation and dissemination by the scientific
community.
A further possibility is that non-coding RNA gene 4 is an
antisense transcript of PDE7B, due to its location in the
reverse orientation of intron 1 of PDE7B. However, it is
more likely to have an unrelated function due to the nonoverlapping intron/exon structure.
Comparative genomics
A novel comparative genomic strategy was used in an
attempt to identify any genes which may have been
missed using conventional approaches. PipMaker [44]
was used to compare the candidate interval with the syntenic mouse region (on chromosome 10); all regions that
had retained over 70% homology with the mouse within
a sequence of 100 bp in length, but did not overlap the
known genes, were identified. This homology cut-off has
previously been deemed acceptable [45,46] and in-house
analysis revealed that this level had a very high sensitivity
for the known genes in the candidate interval, whilst not
detecting a large number of surplus homologies. We
based our gene finding strategy on the assumption that
some of these human-mouse homologies may represent
exons of undiscovered genes. Although a significant proportion of these homologies would be expected to
represent regulatory elements, it is impossible to hypothesize which of the conserved blocks are expressed or regulatory. Therefore an inclusive strategy was designed that
tested all homologies for expression without prior
assumptions.

At the given cut-off, a total of 271 homologies were
detected, with 59 overlapping known exons (~22%) and
68 located within introns of genes (~25%). A total of 144
homologies did not overlap known genes. Working on
the assumption that some of these novel homologies may
overlap undiscovered exons, we subjected the sequence of
these homologous regions to the GeneSplicer [45]
program. This predicted any potential splice sites within
these putative exons, and thus delimited the range of the
putative homologous exons. These predicted exons were
then tested for expression using an RT-PCR based strategy.
RNA from a panel of tissues (lymphoblastoid cell line,
erythroid, bone marrow, spleen, fetal liver, liver and testes) was first DNAseI treated prior to reverse transcription.
The cDNA was shown to be free from residual DNA con-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/33

tamination by the negative results of PCR with a panel of
STS across the candidate interval (data not shown).
Primer pairs for each putative homologous exon
(designed within the predicted splice sites; table 4 (see
additional file 3)) were then tested for expression against
the cDNA panel by RT-PCR, with genomic DNA as a positive control. Conserved regions that mapped within the
extent of any of the known genes were not subject to RTPCR. This was because such RT-PCR experiments could
give a positive result due to the presence of partially processed heterogeneous nuclear RNA (i.e. unspliced intronic
sequence). Therefore the outlined strategy does not have
the power to identify putative genes that are localized
within the introns of the known genes.
Figure 5 (see additional file 2) provides a PIP-plot of the
candidate interval, annotated with the positions of genes
and repetitive sequences, and overlaid with a summary of
the experimental results. The detailed experimental results
of this analysis are presented in Figure 4. The data revealed
the positive expression of 12 conserved regions and weak
positive PCR results for another 38 conserved regions, out
of a total of 144 tested homologous regions. Several of
these positive results (in the region of homology numbers
2→8) appeared to be from the same small region (<100
kb) at the centromeric side of the candidate interval and
all expressed in the spleen. The other positive results were
distributed across the candidate interval in no clear pattern, with the only other notable result being homology
233 which was positive in all tested tissues. To further
investigate the existence of a gene expressed in the spleen
at the left-hand side of the candidate interval, we
attempted amplification spanning the relevant expressed
homologous regions. This involved using e.g. the forward
primer of homology 2 versus the reverse primer of homology 3, to see if a PCR product could be amplified, suggesting that these homologies were separate exons of the same
gene. All such combinations of PCR primers positive from
the comparative analysis were performed in an attempt to
elucidate any possible gene structure. However, all PCRs
were negative (data not shown), therefore the existence of
such a gene is questionable. Additionally, the existence of
the other positive results spread over the candidate interval remains unexplained. All these positive results could
represent intergenic transcription [47,48]. Furthermore,
the majority of the conserved sequences were confirmed
as not being expressed in the cDNA panel, suggesting that
their functional conservation may be related to control of
gene expression. However, the cDNA panel was biased
towards tissues of relevance to this study (i.e. red cell haematology) and it is therefore possible that some of these
homologies may represent genes expressed in untested
tissues.

Figure 4
Results of comparative genomic analysis
Results of comparative genomic analysis. Each column of the figure represents a region of homology from the 6q23 candidate
interval with the mouse syntenic region (over 70% homology and 100 bp). These putative exon sequences are numbered from
1 to 238 at the bottom of each column. Conserved sequences corresponding to regions of a known gene were not included in
the analysis, accounting for the missing numbers. As the conserved regions are not spread evenly across the candidate interval,
the scale is variable but indicated above the table every 0.1 Mb. The locations of the known genes are also indicated above the
table. The results of RT-PCR against the panel of cDNA tissues are indicated by black blocks for positive and gray block for
weakly positive. Each row represents the results for each tissue and is indicated at the left: Spleen, EBV = Lymphoblastoid cell
line, Erythroid, BM = Bone Marrow, Liver, FL = Fetal Liver.

Pseudogenes
All pseudogenes within the candidate interval represented
processed pseudogenes, which are thought to arise by
genomic integration of cDNA sequences generated by
reverse transcription of an RNA transcript. Such pseudogenes are generally not transcribed because of a lack of
functional promoters or other regulatory elements.

Five processed pseudogenes exist within the candidate
interval – GAPD (NM_002046), HMGA1 (NM_002128),
CGI-27 (NM_016139), LOC51142 (NM_016139) and
FAM8A1 (NM_016255), indicated in Figure 1. The combined evidence of a disrupted ORF and lack of transcription provides substantial verification that the

pseudogenes are not being transcribed. It is worth noting,
however, that a central exon (exon 4) of RNA gene 1 has a
small overlap (~100 bp) with HMGA1 pseudogene. The
functional significance of this is not known.

Discussion
Nine genes were discovered in a region encompassing
approximately 1.5 Mb of chromosome 6q23 using an
integrated in silico and 'wet biology' approach with comparative genomics. These 9 genes produced a total of 30
different transcripts (around three different transcripts per
gene) which is much higher than recent estimates of alternative splicing [49], a reflection perhaps, of the thorough
annotation strategy that was used here.

Page 9 of 14

BMC Genomics 2004, 5

The majority of the discovered alternate transcripts are
unlikely to be functional at the protein level. This is due
to the alternate exons interrupting and truncating the
open reading frame. Of the 19 alternate splice variants of
the 5 protein coding genes, only MYB exon 9A, MYB exon
8', HBS1L exon 4A, AHI1 exon 22A and the AHI1 transcript that skips exon 2 contain either further novel protein coding information or a complete open reading
frame, suggesting that these splice variants are also protein
coding. Truncation of the ORF in the majority of splice
variants (particularly MYB) does not necessarily exclude a
functional role for these alternative variants. For instance,
the RNA could produce a shorter protein product, or
could be involved in the control of gene expression.
Recent evidence suggests that at least one third of alternative splice variants produce transcripts with premature
stop codons, and that these transcripts may be involved
with regulated unproductive splicing and translation
(RUST). This mechanism of coupling of alternative splicing and nonsense mediated decay (NMD) may be a common and underappreciated means of regulating protein
expression [50].
Further to the questionable nature of these alternate splice
variants, there were four other non-coding RNA genes discovered in the candidate interval. The prevalence and
importance of such transcripts has been grossly underestimated until recently and such genes would appear to be
more common in genomic regions subjected to thorough
annotation [51-53]. In particular, the most powerful
approaches currently available (tiling paths of oligonucleotide microarrays) have revealed that around half of transcription occurs outside of any annotated genes, with such
transcripts having lower and more limited expression. A
large proportion of these transcripts appear to be non protein-coding, corroborating our findings [54-56]. Such
results suggest that even thorough annotation may not
uncover all transcriptional activity.
The short ORF of the non-coding transcripts does not preclude the hypothesis that these genes could in fact be protein coding, due to the existence of genes encoding very
short proteins [57]. To question the validity of these genes
further, we overlaid the exon sequence of these transcripts
with the comparative mouse data. For all the non-coding
transcripts, only a single exon of transcript 3 contained
70% identity over 100 bp with mouse sequence (homology 32 in Figure 5). Furthermore, these non-coding
sequences were compared to the non-human EST databases by BLAST search to identify if any homologous
genes existed in other species. Again, the only significant
homologies were identified for transcript 3. This included
two homologies with rat EST sequences (AA997847; 85%
identity over 227 bp, and AI235855; 82% identity over
227 bp) and one homology with a mouse EST sequence

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/33

(BY735461; 86% identity over 227 bp). This is strong evidence that sequence from transcript 3 is biologically
relevant and conserved through evolution. However, the
homologous ESTs represent anonymous, short sequences
that are entirely uncharacterized and do not contain long
open reading frames. Despite strong evidence of the functional nature of at least one of these apparently non-coding sequences, this lack of information precludes any
functional assignment.
A range of techniques had been used to generate the transcripts in this region, each of which had various merits.
We found resources such as ensembl, UCSC genome
server and the NCBI map viewer invaluable, each providing a good overview of biologically relevant data within
the candidate interval. However, whilst such data is rarely
totally incorrect, it is error prone and requires manual
inspection and confirmation. The homology and EST data
provided a second tier of valuable information. Whilst
much of this information overlapped known genes, both
sources recognized apparently functional alternate transcripts and novel genes that would have otherwise been
missed. Because the annotations based on these
approaches are biased strongly in favor of protein-coding
transcripts, a large proportion of non-coding RNAs could
still be missed, as demonstrated by recent studies using
high-density oligonucleotide arrays [54-56].
The detailed transcript map is presently being used as a
guide for mutation analyses in the Asian-Indian kindred
[13], with the aim of identifying the specific genetic lesion
responsible for raised fetal hemoglobin expression.
Whilst we are making no assumptions concerning the
gene responsible, it is possible to use functional and
bioinformatic information for prioritisation. In particular, MYB, a haematopoietic-specific transcription factor, is
known to influence proliferation, differentiation and cell
cycle progression and therefore presents itself as the most
obvious candidate. However, the presence of SH3 and
WD40 repeats in AHI1 suggests that it is involved with
protein-protein interactions and could, potentially influence a diversity of cellular functions, therefore it remains
a good candidate gene. The other three protein-coding
genes appear to be the least viable candidates – PDE7B
contains only one exon within the candidate interval,
ALDH8A1 is not expressed in the candidate tissue (erythroid cells) and HBS1L is a translation elongation factor.
We are currently in the process of analysing all the protein
coding genes for mutations and have initiated in-vitro cellular studies to examine protein function.

Methods
Bioinformatic analysis of candidate interval
All described analysis were performed on the NCBI assembly 29 of human chromosome 6, with the candidate

Page 10 of 14

BMC Genomics 2004, 5

region located to 146786098-148413740 bp of this
assembly. The syntenic mouse region (for PIP analysis)
comprised the reverse complement of chromosome 10:
20172930-21905929 bp on the MGSCv3 build. Initial
analysis of the genomic region included analysis of GC
content using the EMBOSS [58] program "geecee" and
analysis of repeats using RepeatMasker [59]. BLAST
searches were performed using default parameters for
nucleotide sequences against the human nucleotide database [33] and the miRNA registry [60]. For the
identification of human EST homologies, BLAST searchers
were performed using default parameters against the
human EST database. Strong EST homologies (greater
than 95% identity over >100 bp) were identified by parsing the results using an in-house Perl script.
Annotation of individual candidate genes was achieved
using a combination of Ensembl [61] and the UCSC
genome browser [62], with the gene predictions in table 1
being derived from these genome browsers.
PCR amplification of short products
PCR reactions were of a total volume of 15 µl or 50 µl,
with a template of approximately 50 ng genomic DNA, 1
ng Plasmid DNA or 50 ng cDNA, 5–10 pMoles of the forward and reverse PCR primers, 0.1 mM of each dNTP
(Boehringer Mannheim), 1.5–2.5 mM MgCl2, and 1U of
TaqGold DNA polymerase (PE Biosciences). Typical thermal cycling parameters consisted of an initial denaturation step of 94°C for 10 mins, followed by 30–35 cycles
of denaturation (94°C for 1 min), annealing (50°–60°C
for 1 min) and extension (72°C for 1 min), and a final
extension of 72°C for 5 mins. 1–10 µl of PCR product was
resolved on a 0.8–2% agarose gel containing Ethidium
Bromide (EtBr) by electrophoresis.
RNA samples
The following human total RNA samples were purchased
from Clontech: Bone marrow, colon, small intestine,
spleen, stomach, thymus, testes and human fetal liver.
Placental RNA was included with the clontech SMARTRACE kit (described later). Erythroid progenitor RNA was
obtained using the Fibach culture [63] and B-cell RNA
from EBV cell lines using standard methodologies. RNA
was prepared by guanidinium-thiocynate phenol-chloroform extraction [64].
Synthesis of first-strand cDNA
Reverse transcription (RT) reactions were performed by
initially mixing 1 µg of RNA, 0.5 µg oligo(dT) primer or
0.2 µg random hexamer in a total of 10 µl, incubating at
70°C for 5' and chilling on ice. The following components were then added; 4 µl of 5 × reaction buffer, 2 µl 10
mM dNTP mix, 1 µl (20 u) ribonuclease inhibitor and
nuclease free deionized water to 19 µl. The random

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/33

hexamer reaction was incubated at 25°C for 5 min and
the Oligo(dT) reaction incubated at 37°C for 5 min. 200U
(1 µl) of SuperScript II (GibcoBRL) was added to each
reaction, followed by incubation at the appropriate temperature for the enzyme for 1 hour. The reaction was
stopped at 70°C for 10 mins followed by pooling of the
random hexamer and oligo(dT) reactions of the same
sample. For RT-PCR, 1 µl of first strand cDNA was utilized
as template in standard PCR reactions.
Sequencing IMAGE EST clones
Plasmid DNA for IMAGE clones was prepared using the
Qiagen plasmid mini-prep spin kit according to the manufacturer's conditions, and sequencing was performed
using Perkin Elmer BigDye terminator chemistry under
standard conditions.
RACE
All RACE reactions were carried out using the Clontech
SMART RACE cDNA Amplification Kit, according to the
Clontech manufacturer's guidelines. These RACE products
were gel purified and cloned directly using the TOPO TA
type PCR kit for sequencing (Invitrogen life technologies),
prior to sequencing of cloned inserts by BigDye terminator chemistry (Applied Biosystems). For some transcript
sequences the 3' end of the transcript was already known
due to the presence of poly(A) tails and signals, so only 5'
RACE was required. In the case of transcript 1, a second,
nested RACE primer was used to get the full-length transcript. The primers used for RACE extension of transcript
sequences are as follows:

Non-coding transcript 1-5'-RACE: TGTGTAGTCAAGTCCAGTCATCAGCAG,
1-5'RACE2:
AGACTGTTCCCGCTCGCGTGGCCG, Non-coding transcript 2-3'RACE: TATTGACACGGCGCTACCACGGG, Non-coding

CATCATCTTCCCCTGTTTGTTAGCTT, Non-coding transcript 3-3'-RACE: ATGGAACAGACTAGAAGGAC, Non-coding transcript 3-5'-RACE:
AGTGCCACCTGACCGCTTGA, Non-coding transcript 45'-RACE: GCAAGGTGGTGTCAACATGGTAGG
Comparative genomic analysis
Initial comparative genomic analysis was performed using
PipMaker [44], with the following syntenic sequences
used for analysis: 1) human chromosome 6:146786098148413740 bp from NCBI assembly 29 and 2) mouse
chromosome 10:20172930-21905929 bp from MGSCv3
and the PipMaker options "search one strand" and
"chaining". The "concise" output file from PipMaker was
parsed with in-house Perl scripts to select all homologies
with >70% homology over 100 bp, to remove all homologies which overlapped with known genes in the candidate interval, and to extract DNA sequences for each of
these selected homologous sequences. These sequences

were analyzed with GeneSplicer [65] (with options set at
-e 1 -a 1), and the region on which RT-PCR primers were
designed reduced to within the best predicted splice site.
All primers were then designed by eprimer3 for RT-PCR
(table 4 (see additional file 3)).
