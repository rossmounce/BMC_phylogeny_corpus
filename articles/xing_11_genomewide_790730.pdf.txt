Abstract
Background: Auxin signaling is vital for plant growth and development, and plays important role in apical
dominance, tropic response, lateral root formation, vascular differentiation, embryo patterning and shoot
elongation. Auxin Response Factors (ARFs) are the transcription factors that regulate the expression of auxin
responsive genes. The ARF genes are represented by a large multigene family in plants. The first draft of full maize
genome assembly has recently been released, however, to our knowledge, the ARF gene family from maize
(ZmARF genes) has not been characterized in detail.
Results: In this study, 31 maize (Zea mays L.) genes that encode ARF proteins were identified in maize genome. It
was shown that maize ARF genes fall into related sister pairs and chromosomal mapping revealed that duplication
of ZmARFs was associated with the chromosomal block duplications. As expected, duplication of some ZmARFs
showed a conserved intron/exon structure, whereas some others were more divergent, suggesting the possibility
of functional diversification for these genes. Out of these 31 ZmARF genes, 14 possess auxin-responsive element in
their promoter region, among which 7 appear to show small or negligible response to exogenous auxin. The 18
ZmARF genes were predicted to be the potential targets of small RNAs. Transgenic analysis revealed that increased
miR167 level could cause degradation of transcripts of six potential targets (ZmARF3, 9, 16, 18, 22 and 30). The
expressions of maize ARF genes are responsive to exogenous auxin treatment. Dynamic expression patterns of
ZmARF genes were observed in different stages of embryo development.
Conclusions: Maize ARF gene family is expanded (31 genes) as compared to Arabidopsis (23 genes) and rice (25
genes). The expression of these genes in maize is regulated by auxin and small RNAs. Dynamic expression patterns
of ZmARF genes in embryo at different stages were detected which suggest that maize ARF genes may be
involved in seed development and germination.

Background
Auxin signaling plays a vital role in plant growth and
development processes like, in apical dominance, tropic
responses, lateral root formation, vascular differentiation, embryo patterning and shoot elongation [1]. At the
molecular level, most of these processes are controlled

by the auxin-response genes [2,3], and auxin responsiveness is conferred to these genes by conserved promoter
elements, including TGA-element (AACGAC), AuxRRcore (core of the auxin response region, GGTCCAT)
and AuxRE (auxin response element, TGTCTC).
Among these, the AuxRE promoter elements are bound
and activated by a plant-specific transcription factors
which are called as Auxin Response Factors (ARFs)
[4-8]. An ARF protein contains a DNA-binding domain
(DBD) in the N-terminal region, a middle region that
functions as an activation domain (AD) or repression
domain (RD) [9,10], and a carboxyl-terminal dimerization domain (CTD) that are similar to those found in

the C terminus of Aux/IAAs, which is a protein-protein
interaction domain that mediates the homo- and heterodimerization of ARFs and also the hetero-dimerization
of ARF and Aux/IAA proteins [9-14].
It has been reported that, the ARF proteins are
encoded by a large gene family, with 23 and 25 members in Arabidopsis and rice, respectively [15,16].
Expression analysis suggested that these genes are, in
general, transcribed in a wide variety of tissues and
organs, with an exception of ARF gene cluster on Arabidopsis chromosome 1, which appears to be restricted to
embryo genesis/seed development [15]. Classical genetic
approaches have led to the identification of ARF gene
functions in plant growth and development. For example, arf mutations caused the change in gynoecium patterning (AtARF3) [17-19], impaired hypocotyls response
to blue light, growth and auxin sensitivity (AtARF7)
[20-24], formation of vascular strands and embryo axis
formation (AtARF5) [25], suppression of hookless phenotype and hypocotyl bending (AtARF2) [26-28], hypocotyl elongation, and auxin homeostasis (AtARF8)
[29,30]. Moreover, the mutants of AtARF sister pairs
generally exhibit a much stronger phenotype than that
of single mutants, suggesting that closely related AtARFs
have somewhat redundant roles in Arabidopsis [15]. In
rice, antisense phenotype of OsARF1 gene showed
stunted growth, low vigor, curled leaves and sterility,
suggesting that the gene is essential for vegetative and
reproductive development [31].
Genetic divergence between Arabidopsis and rice ARF
gene family investigated by genome-wide analysis
revealed that most of the rice OsARFs are related to
Arabidopsis ARFs and fall into sister pairs as in Arabidopsis [16,32]. The first assembly of maize genome
sequence has recently been published [33], however, to
the best of our knowledge, the maize ARF gene family
(ZmARF genes) has not been characterized in detail. In
this article, we provide detailed information on the
genomic structures, chromosomal locations, sequence
homology and expression patterns of 31 maize ARF
genes. In addition, the phylogenetic relationship between
ARF genes in Arabidopsis, rice and maize were also
compared, which will help future studies for elucidating
the precise roles of ZmARFs in maize growth and
development.

Results
Identification and chromosomal localization of maize ARF
genes

Extensive searches of public and proprietary transcript
and genomic databases, by using all previously reported
ARF proteins from other species as BLAST queries,
identified a total of 31 maize ARF genes that have
complete sequences in respective bacterial artificial

chromosome (BAC) clones. Among these full-length
coding sequences of 13 ZmARF genes (ZmARF1, 3, 9,
10, 12, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 25, 27 and 30) were further
confirmed by RT-PCR amplification, cloning and
sequencing (Additional file 1). The full length coding
sequences of the ZmARF genes ranged from 1389 bp
(ZmARF31) to 3450 bp (ZmARF20) with the deduced
proteins of 462 to 1149 amino acids (Table 1).
The nearest genetic markers for each ARF gene were
determined from maize BAC contigs and positioned on
maize genetic map. It was found that these 31 ZmARFs
were mapped on 9 out of 10 maize chromosomes, except
for chromosome 7. Six ZmARFs were present on chromosome 3; 4 on chromosomes 2, 4, 5, 6 and 10; 2 on chromosomes 1 and 8; only one on chromosome 9 (Table 1,
Figure 1). In addition, six ZmARF sister pairs were
mapped on the same duplicated chromosomal blocks that
has been described previously [34] (Table 1).
The predicted molecular weights of the 31 deduced
ZmARF proteins ranged from 50.55 kDa (ZmARF31) to
127.47 kDa (ZmARF20) (Table 1). Pair-wise analysis of
ZmARF protein sequences indicated that the overall
identity fell in a range within 1.9% (between ZmARF28
and ZmARF31) to 54.3% (between ZmARF11 and
ZmARF26) (Additional file 2). Moreover, multiple protein sequence alignments were performed using the
CLUSTAL_X program to examine structural features of
these 31 maize ARF genes. The results revealed that all
the ZmARF proteins contained a highly conserved region
of about 320 amino acid residues in their N-terminal portion corresponding to the DNA-binding domain (DBD)
of Arabidopsis ARF family. Except ZmARF 5 and 31, the
other ZmARF proteins contained a carboxyl-terminal
domain (CTD) related to domains III and IV found in
Aux/IAA proteins (Additional file 3).
It has been reported that the middle region of ARFs
function as activation or repression domains [35].
Transfection assays with plant protoplasts indicated that
AtARF1, 2, 3, 4, and 9 are repressors [35,36], among
which AtARF1 contain middle region rich in proline (P),
serine (S) and threonine (T). AtARF5, 6, 7, 8 and 19,
which contain middle region rich in glutamine (Q), are
activators [37,38]. The detailed sequence analysis of all
31 deduced ZmARF proteins revealed that PST rich
middle regions were found in ZmARF6, 10, 13, 14, 25
and 28, indicating that these genes are more likely to
act as repressors. While Q rich regions were found in
ZmARF1, 3, 9, 16, 18, 19, 22, 27 and 30, implying that
these genes are probable transcriptional activators
(Additional file 3).
Phylogenetic analysis and genomic structure of ZmARFs

Bayesian phylogenetic analysis was performed and the
31 ZmARF proteins were classified into six classes:

and VI(AtARF7/19-like), with each class containing 5, 8,
7, 2, 6 and 3 members, respectively (Figure 2A). It was
worthy to note that in the joint phylogenetic tree most
of the ZmARF proteins fell as related sister pairs (Figure
2A), viz. ZmARF2 and 17, 3 and 30, 4 and 29, 5 and 31,

6 and 14, 8 and 15, 10 and 25, 12 and 24, 13 and 28, 19

and quadruplets in the case of ZmARF9, 16, 18 and 22.
The intron/exon structures of ZmARF genes were
determined by alignment of cDNA to genomic
sequences. This sequence analysis revealed that introns
were found in coding sequences of all the ARF genes

and the number of exons varied from 2 to 14 (Figure
2B). As expected, most ZmARF genes in the same sister
pair or triplets showed similar distribution of intron/
exon, whereas the others were more divergent in genomic structure, suggesting that these sister pair genes lies
in duplicated genomic regions (Figure 2B).

The annotated ARF gene family in Arabidopsis and rice
enabled us to determine the phylogenetic relationship
between dicot and monocot ARF proteins. A phylogenetic
tree constructed using the protein sequences of 31 ZmARFs,
25 OsARFs and 23 AtARFs depicted that all of these 79
ARF proteins were also divided into six classes (Figure 3).

To determine whether the increased miR167 level
could cause the degradation of transcripts of the six
potential targets (ZmARF3, 9, 16, 18, 22 and 30), we
generated miR167 overexpressing Zong3 lines and the
presence of transgene was confirmed by PCR amplifications of bar gene (Figure 4A). We then analyzed mRNA
levels of these genes in roots of 8-day-old seedling in
wild type and miR167 overexpressing Zong3 lines (Figure 4B). The results of real-time RT-PCR exhibited that
mRNA abundance of ZmARF3, 9, 16, 18, 22 and 30 in
three independent transgenic lines decreased markedly
as compared with wild type, indicating that post-transcriptional regulation by small RNAs may play an
important role in regulating the expression of ZmARF
genes (Figure 4B).

1,000,000 iterations; Numbers on the nodes indicate clade credibility
values; The gene classes were indicated with the same categories
and colors as in Figure 2.

Prediction of potential targets for small RNA

Previous studies have revealed that several ARF genes
are targets for small RNAs. For example, AtARF6 and 8
are miR167 targets [39-41] while AtARF10, 16, and 17
are miR160 targets [40,42,43]. AtARF2, 3 and 4 are targets for trans-acting-small interfering RNA 3 (TAS3 tasiRNA) [40,44]. In this study, putative small RNA target
sites were searched by using the miRanda software. 18
out of 31 ZmARF genes were predicted to be the potential targets of small RNA and the number of target
genes for miR160, miR167, TAS3 ta-siRNA was 7, 6 and
5, respectively (Additional file 4).

To determine the response of ZmARF genes to exogenous auxin stimuli, their expression patterns in seedling
roots at 1, 2 and 3 hours after 5 μM aNAA treatment
were investigated using real-time RT-PCR and fold
induction relative to water-treated controls for each
time point were calculated. This analysis revealed that,
with an exception of ZmARF31, all other genes were
expressed in seedling roots, among which 7 genes
(ZmARF3, 8, 13, 15, 21, 27 and 30) were up-regulated
and 2 genes (ZmARF5 and 18) were down-regulated by
exogenous auxin treatment across all time points. In
addition 7 genes (ZmARF4, 11, 19, 24, 25, 26 and 29)
were up-regulated by auxin after 1 h treatment but
down-regulated later. In contrast, 3 genes (ZmARF1, 9
and 16) were down-regulated over the first 2 h of treatment but up-regulated after 3 h of auxin treatment. The
other 11 ZmARF genes also displayed diverse expression
pattern in response to auxin treatment, indicating the
complexity of auxin-regulated gene expression of
ZmARF genes (Figure 5). Interestingly, the relative
mRNA abundance of some ARF genes, for example
ZmARF1, 7 and 16, were also altered dramatically in
water treatment, indicating that these genes may be
responsive to water logging.
Putative promoter sequences (1500 bp upstream the
5’UTR region) of ZmARFs were obtained from the draft
maize genome sequence. Database search of plant promoters (PlantCARE) [45] detected one or more auxin
response elements in some of these putative promoters.
Notably, three auxin response elements (2 TGA-elements and 1 AuxRE) were detected in the promoter
region of ZmARF15 gene, consistent with its significantly increased mRNA accumulation following auxin
treatment. However, out of 31 ZmARFs genes, auxin
response elements were detected only in promoter

regions of 14 ZmARFs genes (Additional file 5). Thus,
the relationship between auxin-response elements and
auxin inducibility of ZmARF genes remains unclear and
need to be further investigated.

Recently, functional analysis has revealed that some ARF
genes in Arabidopsis play important role in seed development and germination [28,46]. As a result, we focused
on the study of expression patterns of ZmARF genes in
embryos during seed development and germination (Figure 6). Expressions of all 31 ZmARF genes were
detected but they exhibited dynamic expression patterns,
of which 16 genes (51.6%) showed peak expression in
embryos at 24 h after imbibition. In addition, the
expression patterns of duplicated ZmARF genes also
varied considerably. For example, the expression level of
ZmARF1 gene was much higher than that of its sister
gene ZmARF20 and the time point of peak expression
was also different for ZmARF2 and ZmARF17. It is
worthy to note that the relative mRNA abundances of 8
ZmARF genes in dry mature embryos were higher than
in immature embryos which further increased during
seed germination (Figure 6). We observed that the
mRNA accumulation of ZmARF2 gene peaked in dry
mature embryo but declined after seed imbibition (Figure 6). RT-PCR analysis of embryos (15d after pollination) and two vegetative tissues (8-day-old seedling
leaves and roots) detected transcripts of ZmARF genes
with an exception of ZmARF31 in 8-day-old seedling
leaves and roots (Additional file 6).

Discussion
Characterization of an expanded ARF gene family in
maize

It is believed that the long evolutionary periods experienced by a particular organism is the cause of having
multiple members in the specific gene family [16,47].
Several rounds of whole genome duplication have been
reported in the maize genome [48]. In this study, we
identified and characterized 31 maize ARF genes
through genome-wide analysis, suggesting that maize
ARF gene family was expanded compared to Arabidopsis
(23) and rice (25) [15,16]. Phylogenetic analysis revealed
that maize ARF gene family contained ten sister pairs,
two triplets and one quadruplet. However, none of these
pairs were genetically linked to each other on their corresponding chromosomal locations. On the other hand,
all closely linked ZmARF loci such as ZmARF3 and
ZmARF4 on chromosome 2; ZmARF17, 18, 19 and 20
on chromosome 5 and ZmARF29, 30 and 31 on chromosome 10 were not paired together into the same sister groups. Moreover, at least six ZmARF sister pairs
mapped on the same duplicated chromosomal blocks
(Table 1) [34]. Thus, the expansion of maize ARF gene
family could be explained by the ancient tetraploid
ancestry of maize, in which genome duplication
occurred after divergence from the common ancestor of
rice and maize, followed by subsequent diploidization en
route to modern maize [49-51].
Expression divergence between duplicated ZmARF genes

The presence of duplicated ZmARF genes raises the
question about their functional redundancy. According

Figure 5 Fold induction of ZmARF genes response to exogenous auxin stimuli. For maize inbred line B73, 8-day-old primary roots were
harvested after0, 1, 2 and 3 hours of incubation in 5 μM aNAA and distilled water. Relative mRNA abundance of each gene was normalized
with b-Actin gene, with the exception of ZmARF31 (No signal detected in this tissue). Paired t-test was used to determine the significance of
differences of relative mRNA abundance between auxin treatment and water control at each time point, and fold induction with significant
difference was listed at the top of column.

to the evolutionary models, duplicated genes may
undergo different selection processes: nonfunctionalization where one copy loses the function, hypofunctionalization where expression/function of one copy decreases,
neofunctionalization where one copy gains a novel function, or subfunctionalization where the two copies partition or specialize into distinct functions [52-54]. These
evolutionary fates may result in divergence of expression
patterns or protein structure. Evidence for divergence
between the duplicate genes could be inferred from
expression pattern of ZmARF5 and 31 genes. ZmARF5
was highly expressed in seed embryos during germination but the transcript of ZmARF31 was very low. In
addition, possible subfunctionalization shifts the expression pattern trends of gene pairs. For example, the

mRNA abundance of ZmARF2 peaked in dry mature
embryo but ZmARF17 was highly expressed in embryos
at 24 h after seed imbibition.
Regulation of ZmARF gene expression

Since ARFs are transcription factors that regulate
expression of auxin response genes, it would be interesting to determine the response of ZmARF gene to auxin
treatment. It has been reported that Arabidopsis ARF4,
5, 16 and 19 and rice OsARF1 and 23 transcripts
increased slightly in response to auxin, while OsARF5,
14 and 21 decreased marginally [15,16,55-57]. In the
present study, we found that most of the ZmARF genes
were responsive to exogenous auxin treatment but the
auxin responsive elements were only detected in

Figure 6 Expression profiling of ZmARF genes in embryos during seed development and germination. For maize inbred line B73, seed
embryos of 15 and 20 days after pollination were harvested from greenhouse-grown plants which were planted in a sand/peat under 15 h of
light (25°C) and 9 h of dark (20°C) conditions, and embryos were detached from seeds at 0, 12, 24 and 48 h after imbibition in a chamber at
25°C with 12 h light/dark cycle (12 h day/12 h night).

promoter region of 14 ZmARF genes. Therefore, the
underlying mechanism for auxin inducibility of ZmARF
genes needs to be elucidated.
There is a growing body of work showing the posttranscriptional regulation of ARF transcript abundance
by micro-RNAs (miRNA or miR) and trans-acting-small

interfering RNAs (ta-siRNA) [42]. Regulation of AtARF6
and 8 by miR167 is important for development of
anthers and ovules [39-41,58], regulation of AtARF17 by
miR160 is important for Arabidopsis growth and development [40] and regulation of AtARF10 and 16 by
miR160 plays a role in root cap formation [40,56]. The

regulation of AtARF3 and 4 targeted by TAS3 ta-siRNAs
is required for proper leaf development [59] and juvenile
to adult phase changes [60-62]. The target sites of these
three small RNAs were also detected in maize ARF
genes, and are widely conserved in dicots and monocots.
Furthermore, our transgenic analysis exhibited that
increased miR167 level could cause degradation of transcripts for six potential targets (ZmARF3, 9, 16, 18, 22
and 30), indicating that ZmARF genes showed posttranscriptional regulation. However, we found that the
expression patterns of ZmARF genes which contained
the same target sites varied considerably in embryos
during seed development and germination, for example
the expression of ZmARF11, 12, 23, 24 and 26 with two
potential TAS3 ta-siRNAs recognition sites. Thus, we
speculate that some unidentified factors may also play a
role in regulating expression of these genes, which could
be highly specific to a selected tissue type or developmental program with the possibility that miRNA and
tasiRNA may have functions in very discreet regions.

germination, reaching its peak in embryos after 24 h of
seed imbibition and decreased in later stage, whereas
ZmARF2 showed high transcript accumulation in dry
seed embryos. In addition, dynamic expression patterns
were also observed for other ZmARF genes. Collectively, we speculate that ZmARF genes may be involved
in diverse aspects of developmental processes during
seed germination.

Potential functions of ZmARF genes during seed
development

Methods

Seed development is considered as a physical link
between parents and sporophytic generation in plants
[63]. Auxin signaling is thought to play an important
role in embryo development. For example, a higher
level auxin is detected in root apex and ends of cotyledon primordia from heart to mature embryo in Arabidopsis [64]. Defects in Arabidopsis embryo patterning
was observed in arf5 mutants, which enhanced in
arf5arf7 double mutants [65]. In this study, seven
ZmARF genes, including ZmARF1, 10, 13, 14, 18, 22
and 25, appeared to be constitutively expressed in
developing embryos, whereas the transcripts of other
ZmARF genes exhibited dynamic expression patterns,
suggesting the partitioning of functions between these
genes in embryo development.
In most flowering plants, seed germination is the
first and may be the foremost growth stage in the
plant’s life cycle. Genetic evidence supporting a role of
ARF genes in germination has been obtained from the
analysis of regulation of AtARF10 by miR160 [46]. It
has been reported that transgenic seeds of Arabidopsis
expressing a miR160-resistant form of AtARF10
(mARF10) are hypersensitive to germination inhibition
by exogenous ABA, whereas ectopic expression of
miR160 results in a reduced sensitivity to ABA [46]. In
the present study, ZmARF2, 5, 8, 15, 17 and 21 are
predicted to be the targets for miR160, which falls in
the same subfamily with AtARF10, 16 and 17. Expression analysis demonstrated that mRNA accumulation
of ZmARF3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 21,
22, 25, 28 and 30 gradually increased during seed

A local implementation of NCBI BLASTX was used for
sequence searching. All publicly known ARF genes
from Arabidopsis (AtARF1-AtARF23) [15] and rice
(OsARF1-OsARF25) [16] were used in initial protein
queries. Maize (Zea mays) proprietary ESTs and their
assemblies, publicly available ESTs, CDS, GSS, BACs,
and The Institute for Genomic Research genomic GSS
assemblies AZM_4, AZM_5 http://maize.tigr.org/, and
MAGI_4 http://magi.plantgenomics.iastate.edu/ were
the source for sequences [33]. All potential hits to conserved regions of ARF gene family were assembled and
additional rounds of searching were performed to
achieve the most possible complete genomic and/or
transcript sequences. The Pfam database http://pfam.
sanger.ac.uk/search was used to confirm each predicted
ZmARF protein sequence as an auxin response factor
protein. In addition, full length coding cDNA
sequences of 11 ZmARF genes (ZmARF1, 3, 7, 9, 11,
14, 17, 20 22, 24 and 30) were further confirmed by
RT-PCR amplification, cloning and sequencing.

Conclusions
Maize ARF gene family is expanded as compared to
Arabidopsis and rice reflecting a succession of maize
genomic rearrangements and expansions due to extensive duplication and diversification that frequently
occurred in the course of evolution. The expressions of
maize ARF genes are regulated by auxin and small
RNAs. Dynamic expression patterns of ZmARF genes in
embryo at different stages were observed, which suggest
that these genes may be involved in seed development
and germination.

the total RNA was confirmed by electrophoresis in 1%
formamide agarose gel. For each plant tissue sample, 2
μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA in
20μl reaction using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega Corporation, USA). Reverse transcription was

performed at 37°C for 60 min with a final denaturation
step at 95°C for 5 min.
RT-PCR amplification, cloning and sequencing

RT-PCR amplification conditions were optimized from
the method described from the previous study [66]. The
primer information is given in Additional file 1. For
gene cloning, PCR amplified samples were separated in
1.0% agarose gel, purified with Sephaglas BandPrep kit
(Amersham Pharmacia, USA), cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega Corporation, USA) and sequenced by an
ABI PRISM 3730 capillary sequencer (PE Applied Biosystem, USA) using an ABI Prism Dye Terminator

by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation [70] and
the transgenic lines were confirmed by PCR primers (5’GGTGGACGGCGAGGTCGCCG-3’ and 5’-TCGGTG
ACGGGCAGGACCGG-3’) specific to bar gene.
For expression analysis, roots of Zong3 (wild type) line
and three homologous pre-MIR167b overexpressing
lines (pUBI::MIR167b-22, -36 and -47) were harvested
from 8-day-old seedlings grown in a container with tap
water under 16 h of light (25°C) and 8 h of dark (20°C).
Seedlings were grown in a completely randomized
design and three batches of seedlings were used as separate biological replicates. Relative mRNA abundances of
six AtARF6/8-like ZmARFs (ZmARF3, 9, 16, 18, 22 and
30) were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR.
Auxin treatment

All the sequenced contigs of B73, representing the 10
maize chromosomes, have been physically constructed
and are publically available. The BAC based physical
map generated by fingerprinted contigs http://www.genome.arizona.edu/fpc/maize/WebAGCoL/WebFPC/ was
used to find the nearest available markers to position
ARF genes on the genetic IBM2 map http://www.maizegdb.org. The distinctive name for each of the ZmARFs
identified in this study was given according to its position from the top to the bottom on the maize chromosomes 1 to 10.

Seeds of maize inbred line B73 were placed embryo side
down on two pieces of Whatman No. 1 filter paper
placed in a plastic Petri dish. After overnight imbibition,
maize seeds were transferred into a container with tap
water and grown in a chamber at constant temperature,
(25°C) relative humidity (80%), and subjected to 12 h
light/dark cycle (12 h day/12 h night) for 8 days, then
transferred to a 5 μM aNAA solution. Control plants
were grown in distilled water. Primary roots were isolated after 0, 1, 2 and 3 h of aNAA exposure and from
control plants at the same time points and three replicates were harvested for RNA extraction.

Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of ZmARFs

Tissue preparations

The exon/intron structures of the ZmARF genes were
determined from alignments of cDNA and genomic
sequences using gene structure displayer http://gsds.cbi.
pku.edu.cn/. The identification of small RNA target sites
in ZmARF genes was performed by using miRanda software http://www.miranda-im.org/. Multiple-sequence
alignments of ZmARF proteins were carried out using
the Clustal_X (version 1.83) program [67]. The protein
sequences of Arabidopsis and rice auxin response factors
were obtained from the TIGR database and phylogenetic
analysis was performed with MRBAYES 3.1.2 program
[68] by Bayesian method [69] and the bootstrap test was
carried out with 1,000,000 iterations.

For maize inbred line B73, embryos of 15 and 20 days
after pollination were harvested from greenhouse-grown
plants in a sand/peat under 16 h of light (25°C) and 8 h
of dark (20°C), and seed embryos at 0, 12, 24 and 48 h
after imbibition in a chamber at 25°C with 12 h light/
dark cycle (12 h day/12 h night) were detached from
seeds. Eight-day-old seedling leaves and roots were harvested for expression analysis.

Generation of Ubi::MIR167b maize transgenic plants and
expression analysis of ZmARFs

A 426 bp fragment for the pre-MIR167b precursor was
amplified from maize inbred line Zong3 with the genespecific primers (5’-GAGGATTGTTTACGCCACCTT3’ and 5’-GGAGAGAATTGAAAGAGAGAGAGGAG3’). This DNA fragment was verified by sequencing, and
ligated into the plant transformation vector pCAMBIA3300, downstream to the ubiquitin promoter. This
construct was introduced into maize inbred line Zong3

Real-time RT-PCR analysis

Five commonly used housekeeping genes of maize
(Additional file 7) were evaluated by geNorm algorithm
[71]. Initial steep decrease in average M value of each
gene is shown in Additional file 8, which firmly demonstrates that b-Actin is the most stable control gene (with
the lowest M value). Real-time RT-PCR reactions were
performed according to previous study [72], b-Actin was
used as an internal control. Details of primers used in
this study are given in Additional file 9, and 2μl aliquots
of the cDNA were subjected to expression analysis. The
reaction conditions were as follows: 94°C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles at 94°C for 30 s, 55-65°C for 30 s,
72°C for 30 s, and a final extension of 72°C for 5 min.
Quantification of results were obtained by CFX96™
