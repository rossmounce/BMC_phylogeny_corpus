Abstract
Background: Introgressive events (e.g., hybridization, gene flow, horizontal gene transfer) and incomplete lineage
sorting of ancestral polymorphisms are a challenge for phylogenetic analyses since different genes may exhibit
conflicting genealogical histories. Grasses of the Triticeae tribe provide a particularly striking example of
incongruence among gene trees. Previous phylogenies, mostly inferred with one gene, are in conflict for several
taxon positions. Therefore, obtaining a resolved picture of relationships among genera and species of this tribe has
been a challenging task. Here, we obtain the most comprehensive molecular dataset to date in Triticeae, including
one chloroplastic and 26 nuclear genes. We aim to test whether it is possible to infer phylogenetic relationships in
the face of (potentially) large-scale introgressive events and/or incomplete lineage sorting; to identify parts of the
evolutionary history that have not evolved in a tree-like manner; and to decipher the biological causes of genetree conflicts in this tribe.
Results: We obtain resolved phylogenetic hypotheses using the supermatrix and Bayesian Concordance Factors
(BCF) approaches despite numerous incongruences among gene trees. These phylogenies suggest the existence of
4-5 major clades within Triticeae, with Psathyrostachys and Hordeum being the deepest genera. In addition, we
construct a multigenic network that highlights parts of the Triticeae history that have not evolved in a tree-like
manner. Dasypyrum, Heteranthelium and genera of clade V, grouping Secale, Taeniatherum, Triticum and Aegilops,
have evolved in a reticulated manner. Their relationships are thus better represented by the multigenic network
than by the supermatrix or BCF trees. Noteworthy, we demonstrate that gene-tree incongruences increase with
genetic distance and are greater in telomeric than centromeric genes. Together, our results suggest that
recombination is the main factor decoupling gene trees from multigenic trees.
Conclusions: Our study is the first to propose a comprehensive, multigenic phylogeny of Triticeae. It clarifies
several aspects of the relationships among genera and species of this tribe, and pinpoints biological groups with
likely reticulate evolution. Importantly, this study extends previous results obtained in Drosophila by demonstrating
that recombination can exacerbate gene-tree conflicts in phylogenetic reconstructions.

Background
When reconstructing the phylogeny of a biological
group it is implicitly assumed that species split in a
tree-like manner and that all characters (e.g., all genes
in the genome) reveal the same genealogical history that
has occurred in each lineage after the split from a common ancestor. When these two assumptions are met

phylogenetic trees inferred from one or a few genes can
be used as proxies of the species tree. However, recent
studies have shown that trees inferred from different
genes may conflict with each other and that violation of
these assumptions is more common than previously
thought [1-10].
Incongruence may appear among gene trees for various
reasons. If the genes used to infer the phylogenetic relationships among genera and species are sampled from
introgressed portions of the genome produced by hybridization, gene flow or horizontal gene transfer, the trees
obtained likely reflect the history of the introgression

rather than the history of lineage splitting [11,12]. The
genealogical histories of individual genes may also be
misleading due to retention and stochastic sorting of
ancestral polymorphisms caused by incomplete lineage
sorting. This is especially likely when the effective population size of a given lineage is large with respect to the
time elapsed since divergence [13-15]. In this case,
genetic drift is unlikely to have brought alleles to fixation
before subsequent divergence [1,6]. Finally, gene duplication followed by gene loss may lead to incongruence
because paralogous gene copies are incorrectly inferred
to be orthologous [16].
Whatever their origin, incongruences among gene
trees require careful attention for several reasons. First,
they affect the interpretation of morphological and
molecular patterns of evolution. Second, they maintain
extensive instability in taxonomy. Third, they complicate
the choice of wild taxa as sources of novel genes in
breeding programs (e.g., genes conferring resistance to
pathogens, tolerance to salt, low temperatures and
drought). Finally, uncertainty in phylogenetic relationships may lead to inadequate conservation decisions (e.
g., the protection of particular species or habitats).
In prokaryotes, some authors argue that numerous
hybridizations and gene transfers preclude the possibility and the meaning of a tree-like representation of a
species history [17,18]. In plants too it has been argued
that, in some cases, reticulate evolution is more appropriate than a tree-like description [19]. On the contrary, other authors argue that despite incongruences it
is possible to reconstruct phylogenies and tree-like histories [20,21]. Among angiosperms, Triticeae grasses
provide a particularly striking example of incongruence
among gene trees, suggesting reticulate evolution [22].
This tribe comprises species of major economic importance, including wheat, barley and rye. In recent years,
attempts to try and sort out the phylogenetic details of
the group, based on analyses of single-copy nuclear
genes [23-26], highly repetitive nuclear DNA [27],
internal transcribed spacers [28], and chloroplastic
genes [29-31], failed to lead to any consensual definition of clades. Current evidence suggests that different
portions of the nuclear and chloroplastic genomes
have different genealogical histories. Because published
trees are in conflict for almost all taxon positions we
do not know whether the historical relationships
among the genera and species of this tribe can be
resolved, or not, in a tree-like manner and, if so, what
are the real phylogenetic relationships. In this paper,
we use the most comprehensive molecular dataset to
date in Triticeae, including 27 gene fragments, with
the aim to (i) reconstruct a multigenic phylogeny of
this tribe, (ii) quantify tree incongruences, and (iii)
explore possible factors affecting incongruence,

including the frequency of recombination, chromosomal location and evolutionary rate.

Methods
Species Studied and Loci Sampled

Nineteen diploid species, spanning 13 genera of Triticeae, were analyzed. These species were selected because
they belong to most phylogenetic clades recognized so
far [22,26,29] and represent most of the diversity of
diploid genera (68% according to [22] and [32]), life
styles (annual and perennial), mating systems (self-compatible and self-incompatible), and geographic origin
(Europe, Middle East, Asia, North America and Australia). One or two accessions per species were obtained
from the United States Department of Agriculture
(USDA), National Plant Germplasm System (available at
http://www.ars-grin.gov/npgs/index.html), making a
total of 32 accessions (Table 1). Although Bromus is
supposed to be the closest outgroup of Triticeae
[26,33,34], to simplify primer design we preferred to use
Brachypodium distachyon, a more distant species for
which the complete genome is available [35]. As the
ingroup topology may depend upon the choice of a single outgroup, Zea mays and Oryza sativa were also
incorporated as additional, more distant outgroups. The
choice of distant outgroups may increase the number of
homoplasies. However, owing to the selective constraints
likely acting on the coding sequences we used (see
below), it is likely they have been affected by low substitutional saturation and hence by a low homoplasy level.
Orthologous coding sequences (cDNA) of one gene
fragment from the chloroplast (MATK) and 26 nuclear
gene fragments located on three different chromosomes
(out of the seven chromosomes representative of Triticeae) were sequenced for each accession (Table 2;
GenBank: HM539308-HM540073). Sequences of B. distachyon were obtained from the US Department of
Energy Joint Genome Institute http://www.jgi.doe.gov/.
Sequences of Z. mays and O. sativa were obtained from
the GenBank.
RNA Extraction, cDNA Synthesis, PCR Amplification and
Sequencing

Total RNA was extracted from 100 mg of young leaves
using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). cDNA was
synthesized from this RNA using oligo-dT primers with
the Reverse Transcription System kit (Promega), following the manufacturer’s protocol. For each gene fragment
a couple of primers were designed on conserved regions
identified based on alignments of barley and wheat EST
(Additional file 1, Table S1). PCR amplification was
performed on cDNA and amplification products were
purified with the AMPure kit (Agencourt). Sanger
sequencing was performed on amplicons with the same

was used with 1.0 μl of BidDye v3.1 enzymatic reaction
mix. The reactions were purified with the CleanSEQ kit
(Agencourt) and separated on a 3130×l Genetic Analyzer (Applied BioSystems).
Orthology Determination and Location of Loci on the
Triticeae Genome

Because no genome of Triticeae species has been
sequenced yet the orthology of the 27 sequenced gene
fragments was established indirectly. Two observations
strongly suggest the uniqueness of our sequences in the
genome. First, all the sequenced loci are present in single copy in rice and B. distachyon, two species whose
complete genomes are available. Second, according to

EST data, they are expressed in one copy in diploid barley and in three copies in hexaploid wheat, which suggests the existence of a single copy per genome. The
probability that our sequences coexist with paralogs is
therefore limited.
From the 26 sequenced nuclear loci, 21 were derived
from the rice chromosome 1, known to be collinear
with the wheat chromosome 3B [36-38]. We assumed
that chromosomal locations are mostly conserved across
Triticeae [36-40] and used the location of rice orthologs
as a proxy of their chromosomal position. Moreover, we
checked that using B. distachyon as reference did not
alter the estimated physical position. The relative distance to the centromere of each gene fragment was then
computed assuming that the chromosome fraction
separating them from the centromere was proportional
in rice chromosome 1 and Triticeae chromosome 3
[36,38]. The centromere is located around 17 Mb from
the telomere of the short arm in rice and 388 Mb in
wheat [36,41].
Wheat has a strong recombination gradient [41,42],
like other Triticeae species [39,43,44], which fits a positive exponential function from centromeres to telomeres
[45]. The 21 loci located on chromosome 3 were thus
suitable candidates to study the impact of recombination
intensity in gene evolution. These loci were classified as
centromeric (physical distance < 70% of chromosome
arm), for which recombination is low, and telomeric
(physical distance > 70% of chromosome arm), which
concentrate most recombination events [45]. Due to the
strong non-linear relationship between the physical and
genetic map, the genetic distance along the chromosome
was approximated according to reference [45]. Akhunov
et al. [45] estimated the centimorgan per mega base
(cM/Mb) ratio as a function of the percent of chromosome arm. To obtain the genetic distance in cM, we
integrated the equation given in figure 1 in [45] and
multiplied the result by the arm length:
Genetic distance (cM) = L(0.15x − 0.39x2 + 0.57x3 ), (1)

where L is the length of the chromosome arm (388
Mb for the short arm and 437 Mb for the long arm;
[41]) and x is the relative distance to the centromere.
To follow the evolution of recombination along the
chromosome, positive (respectively negative) distances
were assigned to the long (respectively short) chromosome arm.
In addition to the 21 nuclear loci located on chromosome 3, two loci corresponding to the hardness gene
(PinA and PinB; [46]), one gene fragment corresponding
to a eukaryotic initiation factor involved in translational
regulation (eIFiso4E), and two gene fragments involved
in the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway (CRTISO and

Individual Gene Trees

Raw sequence data were aligned with the Staden Package
[48] and the resulting alignments were manually
corrected. Alignments for individual loci were analyzed
using maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian
approaches. ML analyses were conducted using the best-

fitting model of sequence evolution, based on Akaike
Information Criterion (AIC) using ModelTest 3.7 [49]
(Table 3). PAUP* 4.0b10 [50] was used to obtain the
highest-likelihood phylogenetic trees (heuristic search
with neighbor-joining starting tree, tree bisection-reconnection branch swapping and 100 bootstrap replicates).
Bayesian analyses were performed with MrBayes 3.1.2
[51,52] with the following priors: Dirichlet priors (1,1,1,1)
for base frequencies and (1,1,1,1,1) for General Time
Reversible (GTR) parameters scaled to the G-T rate, a
uniform (0.05,50) and (0,1) priors for the gamma (Γ)

shape and the proportion of invariable sites (I), and
an exponential (10.0) prior for branch lengths. Metropolis-coupled Markov Chain Monte Carlo analyses
(MCMCMC) were run with random starting trees and
five simultaneous, sequentially heated independent chains.
Analyses were run for 10,000,000 generations. We used
the BPCOMP program implemented in PhyloBayes 2.3c
[53] to determine appropriate convergence of the chains
(i.e., the maximum difference [maxdiff] between posterior
probabilities attached to the same clade as evidenced by
independent chains is < 0.10). A burn-in was discarded
after identifying the stationary phase.
Multigenic Trees and Network

We obtained a multigenic, supermatrix tree by concatenating alignments of all 27 loci (24,652 bp). ML analysis
of this supermatrix was performed in the same way as
individual locus alignments using a GTR+Γ+I model.
Bayesian inference was performed by partitioning the

concatenate alignment on the basis of individual loci
using a GTR+Γ+I model. Chains were run for
10,000,000 generations.
Multigenic, Bayesian Concordance Factors (BCF) were
estimated using BUCKy 1.3.1 [54]. BCF estimates the
degree of conflict of individual gene trees and accounts
for all biological processes resulting in different phylogenies (e.g., introgression, incomplete lineage sorting). We
summarized information from five MCMCMC chains
obtained in individual locus analyses with MrBayes and
removed 50% of the samples from each chain as burnin. Then, BCF were estimated using six a priori levels of
discordance among loci (a = 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10 and 100)
and 1,000,000 generations in each run.
Supermatrix and BCF analyses provide powerful
means of using the evidence from all characters in the
final estimation of the phylogenetic tree [55]. However,
they implicitly assume that species split in a tree-like
manner, which would not be the case when hybridization and/or lineage sorting have played an important
role in the history of a group, as seems to be the case in
Triticeae. To identify regions of the phylogeny of Triticeae that have not evolved in a tree-like manner, we
constructed a multigenic network summarizing information conveyed by individual gene trees. The 27 gene
trees were modified using the PhySIC_IST preprocess of
source trees [56]. This preprocess aims at reducing
source tree conflicts by eliminating a topological resolution when it is significantly less frequent in source trees
than an alternative conflicting resolution. We applied a
correction threshold of 0.9 to only keep strongly supported incongruences. Then, a network displaying all
clades present in at least one among the modified gene
trees was computed using the Cass algorithm [57]
implemented in Dendroscope 2 [58], inputted with the
Z-closure of the modified trees [59].
Incongruence Quantification

The level of incongruence among individual gene trees
and the two multigenic trees was first assessed by Shimodaira and Hasegawa tests [60]. The Shimodaira and
Hasegawa test, based on sequence alignments, was used
to compare majority-rule consensus tree topologies
obtained with PAUP* for individual genes and the topologies of the supermatrix and BUCKy trees. Polytomies
were randomly resolved by bipartitions using the multi2di function implemented in the APE package [61] of
R 2.9.1 [62]. This was done because polytomies were
strongly penalized in the log-likelihood score. Indeed, if
polytomies are left unresolved it is not possible to determine whether significance of Shimodaira and Hasegawa
tests was due to the fact that an alternative topology
was more (or less) likely than a given tested topology or
simply because it was more (respectively less) resolved.

Page 6 of 17

In all cases, when polytomies were kept the supermatrix
and BUCKy trees resulted in higher log-likelihoods, consistent with the fact they are fully resolved. Shimodaira
and Hasegawa tests were run using a GTR+Γ+I model in
the BASEML program implemented in PAML 4.1 [63].
In addition, we used the c 2 test of the PhySIC_IST
preprocess [56] to identify triplets of leaves observed in
the multigenic trees that were strongly rejected by the
27 bootstrap gene-tree collections. A strong rejection
was defined as follows: denoting Rs the set of triplets of
a multigenic tree (supermatrix or BUCKy), and Rb the
set of triplets of the 2,700 bootstrap gene trees (100 per
locus), a triplet of Rs was said to be strongly rejected if
it contradicted at least one triplet of Rb and failed the c2
test described in [56] with a threshold of 0.9. Using this
procedure we counted the number of strongly rejected
triplets a taxon belongs to.
To quantify the degree of incongruence between individual gene trees and the two multigenic trees, we
defined a triplet-based distance between a given multigenic tree (Ts) and the forest (Fj) of 100 bootstrap trees
obtained for locus j. To put it simply, the triplet distance represented the percentage of triplets that were
resolved differently by a multigenic tree (supermatrix or
BUCKy) and a given gene tree. In order to separate the
signal of this locus from potential stochastic errors, we
focused on triplets that appeared more than 50% of
times in Fj. This threshold has the advantage of keeping
one and only one resolution per group of 3 species.
Defining a threshold at 60% does not qualitatively alter
our results (results not shown).
We denoted Neq(Ts ,Fj ) the number of retained triplets
of Fj that had the same resolution as Ts, and Ndiff (Ts ,Fj )
the number of retained triplets of F j with a different
resolution. We defined the distance between the tree Ts
and the forest Fj, denoted d(Ts, Fj), as the triplet fit dissimilarity (1 minus the triplet fit similarity [64]) between
the triplet set of Ts and the retained triplets of Fj:
d(Ts , Fj ) =

Ndiff (Ts ,Fj )
Neq(Ts ,Fj ) + Ndiff (Ts ,Fj )

.

(2)

Using similar procedures, we computed the triplet distance between all pairs of the 21 individual loci located
on chromosome 3. We defined a triplet-based distance
between each pair of forests Fi and Fj, where Fi and Fj
were, respectively, the forests of 100 bootstrap trees
obtained for loci i and j. As above, we focused on triplets that appeared more than 50% of times in each forest in order to eliminate potential stochastic errors. The
distance d(Fi, Fj) between Fi and Fj is defined as:
d(Fi , Fj ) =

Ndiff (Fi ,Fj )
Neq(Fi ,Fj ) + Ndiff (Fi ,Fj )

.

(3)

In this way, we obtained a symmetric distance matrix
(M) with 21 rows and 21 columns, where each entry Mij
contained the triplet distance between loci i and j. This
matrix was used in the analysis of gene-tree incongruence and recombination (see below).
Analyses of Patterns of Incongruence

In order to understand the origin of incongruences, we
correlated triplet distances between individual loci and
the multigenic trees (d(Ts, Fj) in equation 2) to relevant
phylogenetic parameters, including alignment length,
average evolutionary rate (estimated with the super-distance matrix method [65]), and shape parameter a of
the gamma distribution (obtained in ML analyses of
individual loci). We also tested if incongruences were
positively correlated with recombination by using the 21
loci located on chromosome 3. This correlation is
expected whatever the origin of tree incongruence.
Indeed, following interspecific hybridization, recombination is necessary for genes of one species to introgress
into the genome of the other species. Alternatively,
because the effective population size is expected to be
smaller in low than in high recombining regions [66,67],
coalescence is expected to be quicker and lineage sorting more complete when recombination is low. We thus
tested if the triplet distance was lower in centromeric
than in telomeric regions by fitting a quadratic regression of d(Ts, Fj) on the genetic distance. We performed
the same analyses on the aforementioned phylogenetic
parameters because recombination could affect incongruences indirectly through these parameters (e.g.,
higher evolutionary rates in high recombining regions).
In addition, we tested whether the distribution of incongruences differed significantly between centromeric and
telomeric loci located on chromosome 3. To this end, we
estimated the triplet distance per pair of loci by distinguishing chromosome arms (short, long) and regions (centromere, telomere). Note that we did not mix loci located
on different arms. Then, we obtained the difference in
medians of the two distributions. To test whether this difference was statistically significant, we performed 10,000
replicates by permuting loci on each arm and recalculated
the difference in medians at each permutation. The median difference observed with the actual dataset was compared with those observed in the permutated datasets.
Finally, closely linked loci more likely share a common
genealogical history than distant loci [13]. To test this
hypothesis we constructed a matrix of genetic distance
between pairs of loci for the 21 genes located on chromosome 3. We correlated this matrix with the matrix of
incongruences by pairs (Mij) and tested the significance
of the correlation by performing 10,000 permutations of
locus locations on each chromosome arm (avoiding permutation from one arm to another).

Escobar et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:181
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/181

Statistical analyses were performed with R 2.9.1 [62]
and analysis of the distribution of incongruences in centromeric and telomeric loci was performed with Mathematica [68].

Results
Numerous Incongruences among Individual Gene Trees

The best models describing the evolution of individual loci
are presented in Table 3 and the corresponding trees in
Additional files 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,
16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 and 28, Figures
S1-S27. Phylogenetic reconstructions using individual loci
produce variable topologies. Often, relationships among
genera and species are incongruent among individual loci.
The positions of Pseudoroegneria and Hordeum are
not stable among individual gene trees: in some cases,
Pseudoroegneria branches in basal positions (e.g.,
LOC_Os01g01790, LOC_Os01g09300, LOC_Os01g24680,
LOC_Os01g55530, LOC_Os01g56630, LOC_Os01g62900,
eIFiso4E), whereas in other cases it branches within
more recently diverging clades (e.g., LOC_Os01g11070,
LOC_Os01g13200, LOC_Os01g39310, LOC_Os01g53720,
LOC_Os01g61720, LOC_Os01g68770, LOC_Os01g73790,
CRTISO, PinA, PSY2, MATK). Likewise, Hordeum, a
genus thought to be one of the deepest among Triticeae
[29,30,33], sometimes branches into quite terminal
positions (LOC_Os01g01790, LOC_Os01g11070, LOC_
Os01g21160, LOC_Os01g24680, LOC_Os01g37560,
LOC_Os01g48720, LOC_Os01g53720, LOC_Os01g55530,
LOC_Os01g56630, LOC_Os01g68770, LOC_Os01g70670,
LOC_Os01g73790, PSY2, eIFiso4E, and CRTISO). Several
other odd relationships involving different taxa are displayed by individual gene trees (Additional files 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22,
23, 24, 25, 26, 27 and 28, Figures S1-S27). In general, individual gene trees have shorter internal branches than
terminal branches (i.e., low treeness). In addition, support
values (bootstrap values and posterior probabilities) of
deeper nodes are weaker than those of more recent nodes.
Similar observations were made in previous studies [22].
Multigenic Analyses: a more Resolved Picture

The supermatrix tree obtained with the concatenation of
all loci (~25 Kb) provides a much more resolved picture
than individual gene trees. ML and Bayesian analyses
are consistent and produce very similar trees. According
to these trees, we distinguished 5 to 7 clades depending
on posterior probability or bootstrap supporting values
(Figure 1). The first divergent group within Triticeae is
Psathyrostachys (clade I), followed by Hordeum (clade
IIA) and Pseudoroegneria (clade IIB). The internal
branches are quite short compared with the terminal
branches, suggesting that cladogenesis occurred in rapid
succession. Two well-supported clades diverge at this

Page 7 of 17

point. The first is formed by Australopyrum (clade IIIA),
Henrardia and Eremopyrum bonaepartis (clade IIIB),
and Agropyrum and E. triticeum (clade IIIC). The second consists of Dasypyrum and Heteranthelium (clade
IV), on the one hand, and Secale, Taeniatherum, Triticum and Aegilops (clade V), on the other hand.
BUCKy retrieves a unique topology irrespective of the
different a priori levels of incongruence (a varying from
0.1 to 100), although mean sample-wide concordance
factors (i.e., the proportion of the dataset that supports
a bipartition) diminish with increasing a (Figure 2,
Table 4). There is agreement between the estimated
sample-wide and the extrapolated genome-wide concordance factors (i.e., the proportion of the whole genome
that agrees with a given bipartition) and both concordance factors are higher in terminal than in deeper
branches. The BCF tree is congruent with the supermatrix tree in several respects. First, Psathyrostachys (clade
I) and then Hordeum (clade IIA) are the first divergent
genera within Triticeae. Second, clade V is retrieved
although branching within this clade changes relative to
the supermatrix tree: Secale and Taeniatherum branch
together, T. monococcum branches sister to Ae. tauschii,
and Ae. speltoides and Ae. longissima group together.
Third, monophyly of clade III is confirmed in this analysis although with alternative branching: Henrardia and
E. bonaepartis (clade IIIB) are the first divergent taxa,
and Australopyrum (clade IIIA) branches sister to Agropyron and E. triticeum (clade IIIC). However, a major
discrepancy between this tree and the supermatrix tree
is worth noting: Pseudoroegneria does not group with
Hordeum but sister to Dasypyrum. Consequently, Heteranthelium branches at the base of clade V and these
two new inferred clades (Pseudoroegneria-Dasypyrum
and Heteranthelium-clade V) are closely related to each
other. Despite differences among the supermatrix and
BUCKy trees, the resolution and support gained with
multigenic approaches compared with single-locus analyses are remarkable. Differences among trees are mainly
due to uncertainty in the position of Pseudoroegneria.
The multigenic network displays most of the relationships present in the supermatrix and BUCKy trees (Figure 3). In addition, it points to the less resolved parts of
the phylogeny that mainly correspond to nodes with low
support. Psathyrostachys and Hordeum are the deepest
genera of Triticeae. Their divergence occurs in a treelike manner as do relationships within clade III. Note
that the topology of clade III is the same between the
multigenic network and the BUCKy tree. Uncertainties
for inter-clade relationships mainly involve Dasypyrum
and Heteranthelium but only few alternatives are proposed by the network analysis. Finally, branching of
most species in clade V is quite variable and this
instability is better taken into account by the network

BUCKy). Overall, the network analysis reveals a general
tree-like divergence history of the Triticeae with local
episodes of reticulate evolution.
Patterns of Incongruence among Trees

One of the most puzzling results obtained in this study
is the numerous incongruences among individual gene
trees. In most cases, Shimodaira and Hasegawa tests
confirm that, regarding a given locus alignment, the corresponding gene tree has a significantly higher log-likelihood than that of other individual gene trees. However,

in most cases, differences between individual gene trees
and the two multigenic trees (supermatrix and BUCKy)
are not statistically significant (Table 5). This suggests
that the splitting histories of species lineages depicted
by the supermatrix or BUCKy trees are reasonable compromises of individual gene tree scenarios.
In order to quantify topological incongruences, we
estimated triplet distances among individual gene trees,
as well as between each individual gene tree and the
two multigenic trees, as described in Incongruence
Quantification in the Methods section. The average triplet distance between individual gene trees (in absolute

average triplet distance between individual gene trees and
the supermatrix tree is 0.21 ± 0.10 (0.08-0.50) and the
average triplet distance between individual gene trees and
the BUCKy tree is 0.25 ± 0.09 (0.07-0.43). In addition, we
counted, for each accession, the number of triplets that
are observed in individual gene trees and strongly
rejected by the two multigenic trees. Excepting the two
Psathyrostachys accessions, all other taxa are involved in
several strongly rejected triplets (Table 6). Pseudoroegneria is often the most incongruent genus (13% or 24%
of all incongruences according to the BUCKy or supermatrix tree, respectively). Whereas Aegilops/Triticum species are not especially incongruent with the supermatrix
tree (16%), they are highly incongruent with the BUCKy

tree (35%). Conversely, Hordeum is involved in many
incongruent triplets when the supermatrix tree is used
(20%) but is only involved in as few as 1% of incongruent
triplets when the BUCKy tree is considered. Results are
similar when we remove the outgroups (Zea, Oryza and
Brachypodium) and re-root the trees with Psathyrostachys
(results not shown). This demonstrates that incongruences are not due to the difficult positioning of the
root of the trees.
The Effect of Recombination on Incongruences

We performed several tests to understand the origin of
incongruences among gene trees. First, we tested if variation in incongruence could be explained by the nature
of the phylogenetic signal. After correlating the triplet

distance between individual genes and the two multigenic trees (supermatrix and BUCKy) with relevant phylogenetic parameters per locus, we only detect a
significant positive correlation between the average evolutionary rate and triplet distance separating individual
gene trees from the supermatrix tree (Spearman’s rho =
0.42, P = 0.03), although not with the BUCKy tree (rho
= 0.21, P = 0.28). Next, we investigated the effect of
recombination. Recombination does not significantly
affect any phylogenetic parameter (P > 0.5 in all correlations; results not shown). In contrast, it affects incongruences in three ways. First, incongruences are
significantly greater in telomeric than in centromeric
loci (respective medians = 0.511 and 0.429, P = 0.028;
Figure 4A). Second, loci located close together on the
chromosome tend to have more similar genealogical

histories than distant loci (Figure 4B; rho = 0.22,
P = 0.026). Third, although the statistical significance is
low (possibly because of the small number of genes we
sampled), incongruences between individual gene trees
and the two multigenic trees tend to increase with the
genetic distance between pairs of loci, that is, with the
likelihood of recombination (P = 0.09 for the supermatrix tree; P = 0.10 for the BUCKy tree; in the two cases
we removed one potential outlier; Figure 5). Note that
similar qualitative patterns are observed when using a
more restrictive cut-off to keep incongruences (triplets
that appeared more than 60% of times in the 100 bootstrap trees rather than 50% of times), although the statistical significance disappeared (results not shown).
Again, this is possibly due to the limited number of
genes we sampled.

Discussion
Multigenic Phylogeny of Triticeae

Up to date, morphological and molecular analyses have
failed to infer a reliable phylogeny of the Triticeae. Many
previous phylogenetic reconstructions were based on a
limited number of genes, in most cases only one (see references above). The many conflicts among published trees,
combined with poor resolution of branching among genera and species, prevented a clear picture of the relationships among members of this tribe from emerging.
Moreover, it was not possible to conclude whether reticulate evolution is the dominant rule in this tribe, so that

reconstructing a resolved phylogeny is hopeless, or
whether multigenic approaches could solve the problem.
Thanks to the largest dataset used so far in this tribe (27
genes), we show that combining information from several
loci located on different chromosomes and cellular compartments (nucleus and chloroplast) enable the identification of major clades. Although the branching position of
some groups remains uncertain (e.g., Pseudoroegneria), the
two multigenic trees and the multigenic network enabled
us to resolve most parts of the Triticeae phylogeny.
Some incongruence persists in our analyses. They are
represented in the phylogeny by low support values

(bootstrap, posterior support and concordance factors)
and are summarized within the multigenic network. Figures 1, 2 and 3 show that Psathyrostachys branches sister
to the remaining Triticeae, followed by the sequential
branching of Hordeum. Some previously published phylogenies recognized the early divergence of Psathyrostachys
and Hordeum, including nuclear [23,27,33] and chloroplastic DNA analyses [29,30], although many other studies disagreed [24,26,28,32,33]. Here, Psathyrostachys is
involved in no incongruence (Table 6) and the branch
leading to the rest of the tribe is among the longest internal branches. This clearly indicates that this genus is the
sister group of all other Triticeae.
Our dataset does not allow us to resolve the position of
Pseudoroegneria. No study has raised the possibility that
it branches out with Hordeum, as proposed by the

supermatrix tree, and only one study suggested that Pseudoroegneria could group with Dasypyrum, as proposed by
the BUCKy tree, although support for this relationship
was low [69]. Other studies proposed that Pseudoroegneria could branch sister to Taeniatherum and/or Australopyrum [23,24,33], Heteranthelium [26] or Aegilops
[32]. In other cases its branching pattern was unstable
[22,29] and it was even considered paraphyletic [30,70].
Consistent with the difficult positioning of this genus, the
supermatrix tree groups it with Hordeum with a rather
weak bootstrap support (0.69), although maximal posterior probability (1.00), conflicting with the BUCKy tree.
More strikingly, the three Pseudoroegneria accessions are,
in general, involved in more incongruent triplets than
other accessions (Table 6). This could be due to a strong
capacity of introgression during divergence of this group

and/or a large ancestral population size. In agreement
with the first hypothesis, Pseudoroegneria and Hordeum
hybridized and were at the origin of the species-rich allotetraploid genus Elymus [23,30]. If recent interspecific
introgression were responsible for the incongruence pattern we observed it would likely proceed via polyploids
because all genera investigated here are currently intersterile [71-74]. Polyploids could serve as bridges of genes
between diploid species [22]. Alternatively, if rapid radiation followed by incomplete lineage sorting were the
main factors contributing to incongruence, one would
expect deep branches to be short and less supported than
external branches. This is basically what we observe in
individual gene trees and the supermatrix tree. The relatively strong support obtained in the supermatrix analysis
is due to accumulation of phylogenetic signals when

factors, hybridization and incomplete lineage sorting
of ancestral polymorphism, contributed to the pattern
of incongruence and the unstable positioning of
Pseudoroegneria.
Phylogenetic positions of all other genera and species
varied in previous studies and no consensus emerged. In
the present study we find strong support for clades III
and V, although branching order varied depending on
the multigenic tree. Overall, our results suggest rapid
radiation following -or concomitant with- divergence of
clade III (grouping Agropyron, Australopyrum, Eremopyrum and Henrardia).

Our results provide strong evidence of incongruence
among individual gene trees, unraveling a complex biological reality where different portions of the genome

Locus (chromosome 3)

Figure 5 Effect of recombination on incongruences. Relationship
between the triplet distance between individual gene trees and the
two multigenic trees (supermatrix tree in A; BUCKy tree in B) as a
function of the genetic distance between genes located on
chromosome 3. The triplet distance between individual gene trees
and the multigenic trees is the percentage of triplets of accessions
that were resolved differently by a multigenic tree and a given
gene tree. Solid line: best fit using all points; dashed line: best fit
without a potential outlier (filled point). The genetic distance is
connected to the chromosomal position according to the
schematic diagram presented in C (red point: centromere; dark blue:
centromeric regions; light blue: telomeric regions). D. Degree of
incongruence among pairs of loci relative to the genetic distance
on chromosome 3. Colors represent the degree of incongruence
(white: no incongruence; red: strongest incongruence).

exhibit different histories (their own evolutionary histories). We analyze the pattern of incongruence and pinpoint the role of recombination and gene location on it.
We demonstrate that physically close loci are more
likely to share a common history than distant loci. More
interestingly, loci located in centromeric regions tend to
be more congruent with one another than loci located
in telomeric regions. A similar correlation was found in
Drosophila at the kilobase scale, the scale of linkage disequilibrium in this group [13]. In contrast, the mosaics
of conflicting genealogies observed in Oryza (rice) were
randomly distributed across the genome [75]. It could
be surprising that the correlation we observe holds at
the scale of the whole chromosome 3 (~1 Gb; [38]). Several non-exclusive reasons could explain this pattern.
First, the recombination gradient along chromosomes is
very steep in all Triticeae, including wheat [42,43,45],
rye [76] and Aegilops speltoides [44]. For instance, along
chromosome 3B in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum),
the cM/Mb ratio spans about two orders of magnitude
(from 0.01 to 0.85; [41]). Accordingly, in bread and
durum wheat (T. aestivum and T. durum, respectively),
linkage disequilibrium decays slowly over several cM
[77]. Despite the impressive chromosome size, linkage
disequilibrium could be high in centromeric regions
because recombination is strongly reduced (see [78] for
a study on chromosome 3B). However, the level of linkage disequilibrium is low in barley [79]. This discrepancy highlights the need for studying linkage
disequilibrium patterns in Triticeae in more detail. Second, centromeric genes may have a lower local effective
size than telomeric genes because of hitchhiking effects
due to the lack of recombination [66,67]. In agreement
with this prediction, the levels of diversity positively correlate with the proxy of recombination in Aegilops: the
RFLP polymorphism is 1.5 to 25 times higher in telomeric than in centromeric regions [80]. Consequently,
ancient polymorphisms would be less completely sorted
in genes located in high recombining than in low
recombining regions. Finally, recombination could play
an important role in introgressive events between species. For instance, genes located in high recombining
regions would introgress easier than genes located in
regions of low recombination.
There is no straightforward way to distinguish whether
the overall pattern of incongruence in Triticeae is produced by incomplete lineage sorting or a form of introgression (e.g., gene flow proceeding via polyploids).
Methods that enable introgression and incomplete lineage sorting to be distinguished [81] require the estimation of population sizes and divergence times for all
branches of the species phylogeny. This information
cannot be obtained in Triticeae without making
strong assumptions. More knowledge about population

parameters and divergence times is necessary to distinguish between these two sources of tree incongruence in
this tribe.

Conclusions
Our study contributes two important aspects for
research in Triticeae in particular, and for the broad
phylogenetic community in general. First, we show that
in spite of strong tree conflicts not all clades of Triticeae
are affected by introgression and/or incomplete lineage
sorting. Notably, Psathyrostachys, Hordeum and genera
in the clade III (including Agropyron, Australopyrum,
Eremopyrum and Henrardia) diverge in a tree-like manner, a result that was not supported by previous studies.
Because the evolution of Pseudoroegneria and genera in
clades IV (Dasypyrum and Heteranthelium) and V
(Secale, Taeniatherum, Triticum and Aegilops) is more
reticulated than in other clades, the multigenic network
better reflects their phylogenetic history than do the
supermatrix or BUCKy trees. Second, we demonstrate
that recombination could be an important evolutionary
force in exacerbating the level of incongruence among
gene trees. It would be worthwhile estimating the frequency of recombination of genes used in future phylogenetic studies in order to assess the generality of the
pattern previously observed in Drosophila and now evidenced in Triticeae.
