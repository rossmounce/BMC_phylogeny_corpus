Abstract
Background: It is becoming apparent that perhaps as much as half of the genome of the human
blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni is constituted of mobile genetic element-related sequences. Nonlong terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons, related to the LINE elements of mammals, comprise
much of this repetitive component of the schistosome genome. Of more than 12 recognized clades
of non-LTR retrotransposons, only members of the CR1, RTE, and R2 clades have been reported
from the schistosome genome.
Results: Inspection of the nucleotide sequence of bacterial artificial chromosome number 49_J_14
from chromosome 1 of the genome of Schistosoma mansoni (GenBank AC093105) revealed the
likely presence of several RTE-like retrotransposons. Among these, a new non-LTR
retrotransposon designated SR3 was identified and is characterized here. Analysis of gene structure
and phylogenetic analysis of both the reverse transcriptase and endonuclease domains of the
mobile element indicated that SR3 represented a new family of RTE-like non-LTR
retrotransposons. Remarkably, two full-length copies of SR3-like elements were present in BAC
49-J-14, and one of 3,211 bp in length appeared to be intact, indicating SR3 to be an active non-LTR
retrotransposon. Both were flanked by target site duplications of 10–12 bp. Southern hybridization
and bioinformatics analyses indicated the presence of numerous copies (probably >1,000) of SR3
interspersed throughout the genome of S. mansoni. Bioinformatics analyses also revealed SR3 to be
transcribed in both larval and adult developmental stages of S. mansoni and to be also present in the
genomes of the other major schistosome parasites of humans, Schistosoma haematobium and S.
japonicum.
Conclusion: Numerous copies of SR3, a novel non-LTR retrotransposon of the RTE clade are
present in the genome of S. mansoni. Non-LTR retrotransposons of the RTE clade including SR3
appear to have been remarkably successful in colonizing, and proliferation within the schistosome
genome.

Background
Schistosomiasis is considered among the most important
of the tropical diseases in terms of morbidity and mortality, ranking only behind malaria [1]. International efforts
are underway to sequence the entire genomes of two of
the three major schistosome species, S. mansoni and S.
japonicum [2]. It is anticipated that an enhanced understanding of the schistosome genome will aid in the control of this disease, including the development of vaccines
and new anti-parasite medications [3]. Up to half of the
schistosome genome may be composed of repetitive
sequences, including LTR and non-LTR retrotransposons,
mobile genetic elements that transpose through an RNA
intermediate (reviewed by Brindley et al. [4]). Mobile
genetic elements are drivers of genome evolution [5,6]. In

addition to this role, from a practical perspective mobile
genetic elements offer potential as transgenesis vectors
[7]. Problematically, however, their interspersed, repetitive nature can impede progress during genome sequencing using shotgun sequencing approaches through the
confounding effects of their repetitions on sequence
assembly algorithms [8,9]. For these and other reasons,
we and others have been characterizing the retrotransposons of the schistosome genome [10-15]. Here we
report a novel non-LTR retrotransposon termed SR3, a
member of the RTE clade of non-LTR retrotransposons,
from the genome of S. mansoni. Based on the multi-copy,
interspersed nature of SR3, and the presence of other RTE
elements characterized previously from the genomes of
schistosomes, it appears that members of the RTE clade

may be the most common and successful of the non-LTR
retrotransposons to have colonized the genomes of these
metazoan parasites.

Results and Discussion
New retrotransposons identified in bacterial artificial
chromosome 49_J_14 from the genome of S. mansoni
BLASTn searches revealed the presence of reverse transcriptase (RT)-encoding sequences in the S. mansoni bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) number 49_J_14 [16],
the entire sequence of which has been deposited in GenBank with accession number AC093105 by El Sayed and
co-workers [3]. Annotation provided with GenBank
AC093105 indicated that the sequence included in BAC
49_J_14 is from chromosome 1 of the genome of S. mansoni. Inspection of the nucleotide sequence of BAC
49_J_14, of ~123 kb in length, indicated the presence of a
number of discrete retrotransposons. One of these
encodes a novel long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon, which we have described in a recent report [11] (Fig.
1). In addition, at least three non-LTR retrotransposons
appeared to be located in BAC 49_J_14. One of these
appeared to be a degenerate copy of an SR2 element. SR2
elements are non-LTR retrotransposons of the RTE clade
[17] which are present in high copy (estimated at up to
10,000 copies) in the genome of S. mansoni [10,18]. This
fragment of SR2 was located between nucleotide residues
numbers 11,176 and 13,119 of BAC 49_J_14 and, more
specifically appeared to be located within intron number
1 of the gene encoding cytosolic Zn/Cu superoxide dismutase [19]. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the Cu/Zn superoxide
dismutase gene is present in BAC 49_J_14 between residues 8,020 and 16,898 of BAC 49_J_14. The copy of SR2
in the intron of the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase gene is
~1,830 nucleotides (nt) in length, and included regions
encoding the retrotransposon RT domain (Fig. 1). Over
the putative RT-encoding region, the sequence was 47%
identical to the RT sequence of SR2. At only ~1.8 kb in
length, and since full-length copies of SR2 are ~3.9. kb in
length [18], this appears to be a truncated copy of SR2 that
is unlikely to be autonomously mobile. In like fashion to
the location of this truncated copy of SR2, copies of other
SR2 elements (and indeed other retrotransposons) have
been identified previously in introns of other S. mansoni
protein encoding genes [20,21].
SR3 represents a new family of non-LTR retrotransposon
from the genome of S. mansoni
In addition to the fugitive LTR retrotransposon [11], and
the truncated copy of SR2, at least two other retrotransposons were readily identifiable in BAC 49_J_14. The first
of these was located between nt 346 and 3,552 (i.e., 3,207
bp in length), and the second between nt 97,832 and
101,042 (3,211 bp in length). Comparison of the
sequences of these two prospective retrotransposons

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/154

revealed that they were closely related to one another and
appeared to represent discrete copies of a novel family of
retrotransposons. We have termed the new retrotransposon SR3, whose phylogenetic analysis indicated a new
family of the RTE clade of non-LTR retrotransposons (see
below). (SR3 stands for Schistosome Retrotransposon 3
because two other non-LTR retrotransposons described
previously from S. mansoni are termed SR1 and SR2
[18,22]). (A recent article, published after this present
report was submitted for publication, identified a SR3-like
element in the S. mansoni transcriptome, termed Perere3, and also identified several other novel retrotransposons
[15].) For convenience of description, we refer here to the
copy of SR3 resident between nt 346 and 3,552 of BAC
49_J_14 as SR3-left and the other copy between nt 97,842
and 101,042 as SR3-right, because they are located on the
left and right sides of the BAC as in Figure 1. The fulllength SR3-left and SR3-right elements were comprised of
a single, read through open reading frame (ORF) encoding two functional domains similar to apurinic-apyrimidic (AP) endonuclease (EN) and RT, in that order. The
element terminated with a short repeat sequence,
(TAAG)4 or (TAAG)5 (Fig. 1). The nucleotide and deduced
amino acid sequences of the SR3-left and SR3-right copies
are provided in Additional files 1 and 2, respectively.
The sequence of 3,211 bp long SR3-right element translated into a single, deduced open reading frame (ORF) of
922 amino acid residues that did not include any apparent frameshift or stop codon mutations (Additional file
2). By contrast, the deduced ORF of SR3-left was interrupted by stop codons at amino acid positions 719 and
913 of the ORF (Additional files 1, 3). SR3-right has a
longer terminal repeat unit than SR3-left, (TAAG)5 compared with (TAAG)4, which accounts for the difference in
total lengths of the two copies (3,207 and 3,211 bp). (By
contrast, comparison of the ORFs of Perere-3 (Accession
CAJ00236.1) and the SjR2 retrotransposon (AY027869)
of S. japonicum, with the deduced ORFs of both SR3-left
and SR3-right revealed that the similarity extends well
beyond the predicted ORF of 922 deduced amino acids of
SR3-right [not shown]. Whereas this suggests the possibility of premature stop codon in the SR3 copies presented
here, it may also simply reflect phylogenetic relatedness in
the carboxy-terminal encoding regions and 3'UTRs of
these elements.) Nonetheless, SR3-left and SR3-right are
very similar to each other in sequence, with the ORFs
region exhibiting 94 % identity and 97 % similarity over
the predicted ORF of 922 residues (Additional file 3).
Together, these findings suggest that both SR3-left and
SR3-right are full-length copies and, moreover, that SR3right is an intact, putatively functional and active copy,
capable of autonomous retrotransposition activity. It was
remarkable not only that two copies (SR3-left and SR3right) of this retrotransposon reside in close proximity to

Schematic representation of the structure of non-LTR retrotransposons of the RTE and CR1 clades, including RTE-1 from
Caenorhabditis elegans, SR2 and SR3 from Schistosoma mansoni, CR1 from Gallus gallus, and Perere-5, and SR1-like retrotransposon from S. mansoni. (The structure of a full-length copy of SR1 has not been reported [15, 22].) The sequence motifs of the 3'termini are shown, along with positions of enzymatic domains, EN (endonuclease) and RT (reverse transcriptase). The RTE-1
element (3291 bp) illustrated here includes the 3'-UTR so that it is longer than the 3258 bp, described in Malik and Eickbush
[17] (which included only the region between the 5'-end and the termination codon).

each other in the region of the S. mansoni genome represented by BAC 49_J_14, but also that both copies are fulllength and intact or close to intact. Most copies of nonLTR retrotransposons are 5'-truncated, due to deficits in
their elongation processes, and generally include deletions or insertions (indels), and are thereby rendered inactive [6,23,24].
Four other non-LTR retrotransposons have been reported
from the genome of S. mansoni. These are SR1 and Perere,
discrete members of the CR1 clade, and SR2 and Perere-3,
members of the RTE-1 clade [14,15,18,22]. SR3 was dissimilar to these non-LTR retrotransposons reported previously from the genome of S. mansoni: when compared
with the deduced amino acid sequence of the ORF of SR3,
SR1 shared 23 %/ 38 % amino acid sequence identity/
similarity with SR3, Perere shared 22 %/35 % identity/
similarity, SR2 shared 39 %/55 % identity/similarity and
Perere-3 shared 78 %/88 % amino acid sequence identity/
similarity with SR3 (not shown). Together, these differ-

ences indicated that SR3 was a novel element distinct
from these other schistosome non-LTR retrotransposons.
SR3 represents a new member of a family of the RTE-1
non-LTR retrotransposons
The predicted RT domain of SR3 was aligned with orthologous domains of numerous other non-LTR retrotransposons including representatives from 11 clades of nonLTR retrotransposons, as defined by Eickbush and colleagues [25,26]. Phylogenetic comparison of the RT
domains of these diverse elements revealed that the closest relatives of SR3 were ShR3 from S. haematobium and
Perere-3 from S. mansoni, with close identity also to
AC150430 element from Branchiostoma floridae, SR2
from S. mansoni, SjR2 from S. japonicum and also to RTE1 from Caenorhabditis elegans (Figure 2; and Additional
file 4), placing SR3 in the RTE-1 clade of non-LTR retrotransposons. In like fashion, a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the EN domain of eight clades of nonLTR retrotransposons. The topography of the EN tree, and

Page 6 of 14

BMC Genomics 2005, 6:154

the position of SR3 within the RTE clade, was similar to
the topography represented on the RT-based tree, confirming both the inclusion of SR3 as an RTE clade element
and that SR3 and SR2 were discrete families of RTE-like
retrotransposons (Figure 3; and Additional file 5). Indeed,
in the EN tree, SR3 was more closely related to RTE-1 of C.
elegans than to SR2 of S. mansoni (Figs. 2, 3).
Structure of SR3
Youngman et al. [27] provided the first report of a RTE retrotransposon, from the genome of C. elegans. RTE clade
elements display a broad host range, having been
described from numerous invertebrate and vertebrate
taxa, and from algae and flowering plants [14,15,17,18].
RTE-1 encodes a 1,066-amino-acid ORF containing both
apurinic-apyrimidic endonuclease and reverse-transcriptase domains. A possible first ORF of only 43 amino
acids overlaps with the larger ORF and may be the site of
translation initiation. Members of the RTE clade are characterized by unusually short 3' untranslated regions that
are predominantly composed of AT-rich trimer, tetramer,
and/or pentamer repeats [17]. RTE-derived SINE elements
are also found in mollusc and flatworm genomes.

In addition to the demonstration by phylogenetic analyses targeting both the RT and EN domains that SR3 is an
RTE like element, we compared the structural motifs and
domains of SR3 with RTE-1 of C. elegans and SR2 of S.
mansoni in order to confirm the identity of SR3 as an RTE
clade non-LTR retrotransposon. First, the three elements
were of generally similar length; 3,291 bp for RTE-1 of C.
elegans [17], 3,913 bp for SR2 [18], and 3,211 kb for SR3right. Second, the length of the ORF was somewhat similar; 1066, 1016, and 922 amino acids for RTE-1, SR2, and
SR3 respectively. The RTE-1 and SR2 elements may also
contain a short ORF upstream of the major ORF, although
this has not been confirmed by functional analysis
[17,18,25]. Third, the 3'-UTRs of RTE clade elements are
usually short in length and terminate in several tetrameric
or pentameric, A-rich repeats. SR3 conformed to RTE-1 in
this regard, with SR3 exhibiting a short 3'-UTR of 177 bp
in length and terminating with several copies of the
tetramer, TAAG (Fig. 1; Additional files 1, 2).
A schematic comparison of the structures of RTE-1, SR2,
SR3, CR1, and an SR1-like element, Perere-5 [15,22], is
presented in Figure 4. In summary, the SR3 elements of S.
mansoni conform in all respects to the generalized structure of the RTE clade of non-LTR retrotransposons. Moreover, as with other RTE elements, SINE-like elements
reported from schistosomes may be derived from SR3-like
elements [4].

SR3 is present in genomes of other schistosome species
Investigation of SR3 sequences in the genomes of other
human schistosomes by BLAST search analysis revealed
many sequences similar to SR3 in the transcriptomes of S.
japonicum (e.g., GenBank AY810372, AY915175,
AY813885 and AY915893). In addition, when the nucleotide sequence of SR3-right was employed as the query in
BLASTx analysis against the GenBank non-redundant
database, SR3-like sequences were identified within
introns 1 and 6 of the gene encoding S. haematobium acetylcholinesterase (AChE) (GenBank AY167025) [28]. The
two copies are similar in sequence (~70% identical), both
copies are 5' truncated, and both include regions encoding the RT domain of the retrotransposon (not shown).
The fragment within intron 1 was located between nt
1,023–2,474, and the fragment in intron 6 was located
between nt 18,742–20,658. The predicted RT domain of
the SR3 like element from S. haematobium (termed
ShR3) was included in the phylogenetic tree presented in
Fig. 2 and was found to be phylogenetically similar to SR3
from S. mansoni. The presence of SR3 elements in other
schistosome species can be explained by vertical transmission from a progenitor schistosome species [29], given
that vertical transmission is the expected route of transmission of non-LTR retrotransposons [24].
Numerous copies of SR3 are interspersed throughout the
genome of S. mansoni
Southern hybridization analysis revealed that multiple
bands of digested genomic DNA of S. mansoni hybridized
to the SR3 specific probe, indicating the presence of
numerous copies of SR3 in the S. mansoni genome (Fig.
5, lanes 1 and 2). Hybridization to the gDNA fragments
released by double enzyme digestions revealed an even
more smeared pattern (Fig. 5, lanes 3, 4), clearly suggesting that SR3 elements have interspersed throughout the
genome of S. mansoni. In addition, a bioinformatics analysis using the approach of Copeland et al. [13] was used
to estimate copy number of SR3 by comparisons with reference copy number estimates of other mobile genetic elements and genes reported previously. BLASTn searches
were undertaken using the nucleotide sequences of these
reference genes and the complete nucleotide sequence of
SR3-right. Because the construction of the S. mansoni
BAC library (from which BAC 49_J_14 was isolated)
involved partial digestion of the genomic DNA with Hind
III [16], genes without Hind III sites will be underrepresented in the BAC end sequences. Accordingly, since
sequenced BAC ends from this library constitute a large
proportion of the genomic S. mansoni sequences in the
public domain, we used only genes containing Hind III
sites as reference sequences. As shown in Table 1, the
number of hits for SR3, 110, was higher than the number
of hits for the single-copy cathepsin D gene (0 hits) and
for three high copy number retrotransposons Boudicca

Genomic DNA was cleaved with endonucleases Hind III (lane
1), BamH I (lane 2), EcoR I plus Xba I (lane 3) and Hind III plus
Xho I (lane 4). Molecular size standards in kilobase pairs (kb)

longer than lanes 3 and 4.)

(100 hits, 1,000–10,000 reported copies), SR2 (102 hits,
1,000–10,000 copies), and SR1 (104 hits, 200–2,000
reported copies) but lower than that for the multiple-copy
28S ribosomal RNA gene (157 hits) (100–200 copies).
Although it is difficult with these available data to obtain
a good estimate of the number of copies, however a comparison with the other 3 retrotransposons would give a
tentative copy number for SR3 of between 1,000 and
10,000.

SR3 is transcribed in all developmental stages of S.
mansoni
The nucleotide sequences of the full length of SR3-left and
SR3-right elements were employed as query sequences for
BLAST searches of the GenBank EST database of S. mansoni sequences. The database includes more than 160,000
EST sequences from six developmental stages of S. mansoni – egg, miracidium, cercaria, germball (= sporocyst),
schistosomulum, and mixed sex adults [30]. Significant
hits were found to ESTs from all six of these stages (not
shown). Representative accession numbers of the positive
matches are presented in Additional files 6 and 7, along
with brief details of the regions where the matches were
located and statistical significance of the matches. In brief,
positive ESTs spanning all of the 5'UTR, 3'UTR, EN and RT
were located in most of these developmental stages. Based
on these findings, it appeared that SR3 was expressed in
developmental stages throughout the life cycle of S. mansoni.
SR3 integration sites
In order to investigate the nature of integration sites or target sequences of the new retrotransposon within the schistosome genome, five kilobases of nucleotide sequences
flanking the 5'- and 3'-UTRs of both SR3-left and SR3right were employed as queries to search the GenBank
non-redundant nucleotide and protein databases, and the
GSS and EST entries for S. mansoni. These searches
revealed no significant matches to any sequences encoding genes of Schistosoma species (not shown). However,
they did reveal that SR3 elements appear to target AT-rich
sites, as indicated in Figure 6, a similar preference to L1
retrotransposons within the human genome [31,32].
More specifically, the average AT content of the integration sites of the 21 copies of SR3 shown in Figure 6 was 68
% AT. Whereas target site specificity does not appear to be
stringent for SR3, it can be expected to reflect the recognition sequence of the SR3 endonuclease. For example, L1
elements apparently integrate at numerous sites in the
genome because the endonuclease of L1 preferably
cleaves DNA at the short consensus sequence, 5'-TTTT/A3', where/designates the cleavage site [31,33].

To propagate, non-LTR retrotransposons employ their EN
and RT enzymes respectively to nick a genomic target site
and reverse transcribe the retrotransposon, integrating the
element into a new genomic locus [33-35]. This process is
termed target-site-primed reverse transcription. For the L1
elements in the human genome, a new L1 insertion is usually flanked by short direct repeats derived from the target
DNA locus upon L1 integration [32,36]. These repeats are
called target site duplications (TSDs), and can range from
several to several hundred nucleotides in length [32,37].
Interestingly, both SR3-left and SR3-right are flanked by
TSDs of 10 and 12 bp, respectively; TAGTGGCTAATCT for

SR3-right and CGCTCTTAAA for SR3-left (Fig. 6). The presence of these TSDs provides further indication, along with
their intact structure, of recent activity of these two copies
of SR3 localized in BAC 49_J_14 [see [32]]. Apparently
unlike SR3, and certainly unlike L1, some other clades of
non-LTR retrotransposons exhibit extreme target site specificity, the well-known examples being the R2 and R4 elements which are found exclusively in the ribosomal RNA
genes of insects (e.g., Bombyx mori, Drosophila melanogaster) and nematodes (e.g., Ascaris lumbricoides) or in
simple repeats (e.g., the Dong element from B. mori) [25].
Nonetheless, as noted above, we have detected the presence of SR3 of S. haematobium within introns of the AChE
gene [28], and in addition, other RTE elements have been
reported from gene-rich sites of the schistosome genome.
The degenerate copy of a non-LTR retrotransposon, SR2
[18] in BAC clone BAC 49_J_14 has integrated into intron
1 of the Zn-Cu superoxide dismutase (SOD) gene of S.
mansoni (Figure 1). SR2 from schistosomes has been
recorded from several other target genes including 28 kDa
glutathione S transferase [18], cathepsin D [20] and the
UTR of heat shock protein 70 [10]. Furthermore, the RTE1 retrotransposon of C. elegans was found inserted in the
intron of pim related kinase-1 (prk-1) gene [27]. Thus,
although SR3 and other RTE clade retrotransposons do
not exhibit tight target site specificity, they seem to prefer
to integrate into AT-rich sites and, in addition, are frequently found in introns and other-non coding areas of
protein encoding gene loci.

Conclusion
A new non-LTR retrotransposon, SR3, is reported from the
genome of the human blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni.
Numerous copies of SR3 are interspersed throughout the
S. mansoni genome, and given the apparently intact
sequence of the SR3-right copy of SR3 located in BAC
49_J_14 and the presence of transcripts from at least six
developmental stages of S. mansoni, SR3 appears to be an
active or recently active retrotransposon. This element is

also present in the related human schistosomes, S. haematobium and S. japonicum. Based on phylogenetic comparisons of both the reverse transcriptase and endonuclease
domains, SR3 represents a distinct family of RTE elements, discrete from the SR2 family described previously
from schistosomes [18]. While there are numerous nonLTR retrotransposons in the schistosome genome, most
elements so far described belong either to the RTE clade or
CR1 clades [4], both of which are considered to be more
advanced clades of non-LTR retrotransposons with progressive features including lack of target site specificity
and an ORF encoding endonuclease and reverse transcriptase, respectively [25]. The presence of these and the
apparent absence of some other clades of non-LTR retrotransposons should be informative in understanding the
influence of mobile genetic elements in shaping the schistosome genome and its evolution and in studies of the
phylogeny of schistosomes and related taxa. Finally, for
studies with transgenesis of schistosomes, it may be possible to adapt an active copy of SR3 – such as SR3-right – for
the introduction of transgenes into the schistosome
genome in similar fashion to the adaptation of L1 elements of humans for studies on the movement of LINE
elements in cultured human cell lines [23,37,38].

Methods
Bioinformatics approaches for detection of mobile
sequences in the schistosome genome
The keyword phrase <Reverse Transcriptase> was used as
the query to search the EST_others and GSS databases at
GenBank for novel schistosome sequences associated
with mobile genetic elements. Schistosome RT-like
sequences that were retrieved were employed subsequently to search for matches in the GenBank non-redundant sequence database using BLASTn, BLASTx and/or
tBLASTn [39]. Sequences of the previously characterized
schistosome retrotransposons including Gulliver, pido,
SjR2 of S. japonicum [4] and Boudicca [12] also were
employed as queries. In addition, retrotransposon integration sites were investigated by interrogation of the S.

Institute, Hinxton, U.K [40].
Parasites and parasite DNA
The life cycle of Schistosoma mansoni (NMRI strain, of
Puerto Rican origin) was maintained at the Queensland
Institute of Medical Research, Brisbane, Australia using
experimentally infected mice and albino Biomphalaria
glabrata snails. Genomic DNAs (gDNAs) of adult mixed
sex parasites perfused from mice and cercariae (shed from
snails) of S. mansoni were extracted using Qiagen's
Genomic Tip-100 system according to the manufacturer's
instructions.

Southern hybridization
Thirty micrograms of S. mansoni gDNA was cleaved with
restriction enzymes Hind III, EcoR I, BamH I and Xho I.
Digested gDNA was fractionated through 0.8% agarose
gel and then was transferred to nylon membrane
(Hybond-N+, Amersham Biosciences) by capillary action
[41]. Southern hybridization analysis was performed
using a horseradish peroxidase labelled probe and the
ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was incubated in hybridization medium (provided
with kit) supplemented with the labeled probe overnight
at 42°C, after which the membrane was washed in 0.4%
SDS, 0.5× SSC at 42°C (two washes, 20 min. each) and
subsequently in 2× SSC at room temperature (two washes,

5 min. each). The retrotransposon-like gene probe was
amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with specific primers using S. mansoni gDNA as a template. Specific primers targeting the amplification of the RT domain
of SR3 were SR3-forward, 5'-GAAGATTTGGGAAGAGGAACA and SR3-reverse, 5'-AACGATGCTCCCCAGATAAT
(spanning nucleotides 1,809–2,622, Additional file 1).
The SR3-right gene probe was amplified using specific
primer SR3 forward (same as for the SR3-left probe) and
SR3-right reverse 5'-CAACGATGCTCCCCAGGTACTTG
(nt 1,809–2,622). Probes were sized in gels, isolated and
purified before use. These probe sequences have been
assigned GenBank accession numbers DQ008120 and
DQ008121 for the SR3-left- and SR3-right-based probes,
respectively.
Sequence analysis and phylogenetic analysis of new
retrotransposons
The amino acid sequences of the functional domains of
both RT and EN of both copies of the new non-LTR retrotransposon were aligned to other non-LTR retrotransposons by the ClustalW method [42] using BioEdit
software [43] and optimized gaps and errors were referenced to conserved domains defined by Malik et al. [25].
Edited sequence alignments of the RT and EN domains
were analyzed for phylogenetic relationships using the
PHYLIP package [44]. Phylograms were generated and
assessed for bootstrap values of 1,000 replicates using the
neighbor-joining method with assistance from SEQBOOT
and NEIGHBOR in the PHYLIP software suite [44]. Trees
were displayed by TreeView [45]. Sequences used in the
phylogenetic analyses were obtained from the GenBank,
EMBL and PIR databases. They included family representatives from 11 major clades of non-LTR retrotransposons
[25]. RT sequences of Group II introns from bacteria and
EN sequences from bacteria were used as outgroups for
the RT and EN trees, respectively. The names and accession numbers of the aligned sequences were: SR1

Copy number estimation
Estimates of the copy number of the SR3 retrotransposon
were established by a comparative bioinformatics
approach [12-14] wherein BLAST analysis of the BAC-end
database of S. mansoni genomic sequences targeted more
well-characterized retrotransposable elements from S.
mansoni, and some other reference genes, for which copy
numbers have been reported. These included the Boudicca and Sinbad LTR retrotransposons [12,13], the nonLTR retrotransposons SR1 and SR2 [18,22], the 18S ribosomal RNA genes, a middle repetitive element [46], and
cathepsin D, a single copy gene [20]. The NCBI database
was searched by BLAST using the sequences of these
mobile genetic elements and some other genes of S. mansoni, all of which included at least one Hind III site. Specifically, the Advanced BLAST function was used, set to
search only the S. mansoni sequences in the GSS database
(Limit by Entrez Query: <Schistosoma mansoni [organism]>), and with the E (Expect) value at 0.000001. This
stringent cutoff value was used to minimize the chance of
counting other RTE-1-like elements in the total copy
number of SR3. Since the formula for E is based not only
on the bit scores of the local alignment of each pair of
sequences, but also on the lengths of the subject and
query [47], no additional correction was made for the
length of the query sequence. Only hits with a Blast score
of ≥100 were counted.
Investigation of integration sites
Five kilobases of the sequence flanking both 5'- and 3'-termini of SR3-left and SR3-right were employed as queries
in BLAST searches of the non-redundant and dbEST GenBank databases limited by the organism [Schistosoma
mansoni]. Sequences flanking additional copies of SR3
identified in other GenBank entries were also used as queries in BLAST searches to investigate the target site of SR3
integration. Multiple sequence alignments of integration
