Abstract
Background: Tardigrades represent an animal phylum with extraordinary resistance to
environmental stress.
Results: To gain insights into their stress-specific adaptation potential, major clusters of related
and similar proteins are identified, as well as specific functional clusters delineated comparing all
tardigrades and individual species (Milnesium tardigradum, Hypsibius dujardini, Echiniscus testudo,
Tulinus stephaniae, Richtersius coronifer) and functional elements in tardigrade mRNAs are analysed.
We find that 39.3% of the total sequences clustered in 58 clusters of more than 20 proteins. Among
these are ten tardigrade specific as well as a number of stress-specific protein clusters. Tardigradespecific functional adaptations include strong protein, DNA- and redox protection, maintenance
and protein recycling. Specific regulatory elements regulate tardigrade mRNA stability such as lox
P DICE elements whereas 14 other RNA elements of higher eukaryotes are not found. Further
features of tardigrade specific adaption are rapidly identified by sequence and/or pattern search on
the web-tool tardigrade analyzer http://waterbear.bioapps.biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de. The
work-bench offers nucleotide pattern analysis for promotor and regulatory element detection
(tardigrade specific; nrdb) as well as rapid COG search for function assignments including speciesspecific repositories of all analysed data.
Conclusion: Different protein clusters and regulatory elements implicated in tardigrade stress
adaptations are analysed including unpublished tardigrade sequences.

Background
Tardigrades are small metazoans resembling microscopic
bears ("water-bears", 0.05 mm to 1.5 mm in size) and live
in marine, freshwater and terrestrial environments, especially in lichens and mosses [1-3]. They are a phylum of
multi-cellular animals capable of reversible suspension of
their metabolism and entering a state of cryptobiosis
[4,5]. A dehydrated tardigrade, known as anhydrobiotic
tun-stage [6,7], can survive for years without water. Moreover, the tun is resistant to extreme pressures and temperatures (low/high), as well as radiation and vaccuum [813].
Well known species include Hypsibius dujardini which is
an obligatory parthenogenetic species [14]. The tardigrade
H. dujardini can be cultured continuously for decades and
can be cryopreserved. It has a compact genome, a little
smaller than that of Caenorhabditis elegans or Drosophila
melanogaster, and the rate of protein evolution in H. dujardini is similar to that of other metazoan taxa [15]. H.
dujardini has a short generation time, 13-14 days at room
temperature. Embryos of H. dujardini have a stereotyped
cleavage pattern with asymmetric cell divisions, nuclear
migrations, and cell migrations occurring in reproducible
patterns [15]. Molecular data are sparse but include the
purinergic receptor occuring in H. dujardini [16].
Milnesium tardigradum is an abundant and ubiquitous terrestrial tardigrade species in Europe and possibly worldwide [17]. It has unique anatomy and motion
characteristics compared to other water bears. Most water
bears prefer vegetarian food, M. tardigradum is more carnivorous, feeding on rotifers and nematodes. The animals
are really tough and long-living, one of the reasons why
M. tardigradum is one of the best-studied species so far.
Questions of general interest are: How related are tardigrade proteins to each other? Which protein families provide tardigrade-specific adaptations? Which regulatory
elements influence the mRNA stability? Starting from all
published tardigrade sequences as well as 607 unpublished new sequences from Milnesium tardigradum, we
analyse tardigrade specific clusters of related proteins,
functional protein clusters and conserved regulatory elements in mRNA mainly involved in mRNA stability. The
different clusters and identified motifs are analysed and
discussed, all data are also available as a first anchor to
study specific adaptations of tardigrades in more detail
(Tardigrade workbench). Furthermore, the tardigrade
analyzer, a sequence server to analyse individual tardigrade specific sequences, is made available. It will be regularly updated to include new tardigrade sequences. It has
a number of new features for tardigrade analysis not available from standard servers such as the NIH Entrez system
[18]: several new species-specific searches (Echiniscus tes-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/469

tudo, Tulinus stephaniae), additional new sequence information (M. tardigradum) and pattern-searches for
nucleotide sequences (including pattern search on nonredundant protein database, NRDB). An easy search for
clusters of orthologous groups (COG, [19]) different from
the COGnitor tool [20] allowing tardigrade specific COG
and eukaryotic COG (KOG) searches is also available.
Furthermore, a batch mode allows a rapid analysis of up
to 100 sequences simultaneously when uploaded in a file
in FASTA format (for tardigrade species or NRDB).
Two fifths of the tardigrade sequences cluster in longer
protein families, and we hypothesise for a number of
these that they are implicated in the unique stress adaptation potential of tardigrades. We find also ten tardigrade
specific clusters. The unique tardigrade adaptions are furthermore indicated by a number of functional COGs and
KOGs identified here, showing a particular emphasis on
the protection of proteins and DNA. RNA read out is specifically regulated by several motifs for mRNA stability
clearly overrepresented in tardigrades.

Results and Discussion
We analysed all publicly available tardigrade sequences
(status 9th of April 2009) as well as 607 unpublished M.
tardigradum sequences from our ongoing transcriptome
analysis.
Major tardigrade protein clusters of related sequencesimilar proteins
All available tardigrade sequences were clustered by the
CLANS algorithm [21]. Interestingly, 39.3 % of the predicted proteins (mainly EST-based predictions) cluster in
just 58 major families, each with at least 20 sequences [see
additional file 1: Table S1]. These include 4,242 EST
sequences from a total of 10,787.

Using these clusters, a number of tardigrade-specific adaptations become apparent (Table 1 [and additional file 1:
Table S1]): the clusters include elongation factors (cluster
12), ribosomal RNAs and proteins (cluster 1, 4, 32 and
56) which are part of the transcriptional or translational
machinery. Cluster 5 (chitinase binding domain [22])
could provide membrane and structural reorganization or
immune protection (e.g. fungi) according to homologous
protein sequences characterized in other organisms.
Other clusters show protein families related to the tardigrade stress adaptation potential, e.g. ubiquitin-related
proteins (cluster 14; maybe stress-induced protein degradation) and cytochrome oxidase-related proteins (cluster
2, suggested to be involved in respiratory chain).
Moreover, proteins responsible for protein degradation
(cluster 15) were found as well as proteins regulating

peptidases (cluster 16). Cluster 23 consists of 53 heat
shock proteins which are involved in many stress response
reactions [23]. Few diapause specific proteins (cluster 24)
are known from other animals. Diapause is a reversible
state of developmental suspension. It is observed in
diverse taxa, from plants to animals, including marsupials
and some other mammals [24] as well as insects (associated molecular function varies but involves calcium channel inhibition [25]) and should here support the tun
formation or regulate other (e.g. developmental) metabolic inactive states. Furthermore, proteins involved in
storage or transportation of fatty acids also seem to be
important (cluster 31, [26]). Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) protein expression seems to be linked to desiccation stress and the acquisition of desiccation tolerance
in organisms [27] e.g. nematodes [28,29] and rotifers
[30]. Thirty-one LEA type 1 family proteins were found in
cluster 38.
LEA proteins are wide-spread among plants and synthesized in response to certain stresses [31,32]. The LEA type
1 family is well known in higher plants (rice, maize, carrots) to be synthesized during late embryogenesis and in
ABA stress response. It includes desiccation-related protein PCC3-06 of Cratersostigma plantagineum. LEA type 1
family occurs in bacteria (e.g. Haemophilus influenzae, Dei-

nococcus radiodurans), but is atypical for animals. However, this is an animal example where LEA family type 1 is
well represented and forms a full cluster.
Moreover, ten clusters (8, 18, 19, 30, 33, 35, 37, 42, 51,
55) consist of proteins which seem to be specific for tardigrades. These show no significant homology to known
proteins.
Functional clusters of stress-specific adaptations present in
tardigrades
To gain a systematic overview of involved tardigrade functions, all available tardigrade sequences were classified
species-specific according to COG functional category
[19,20] as well as according to COG number and molecular function encoded. Note that in this section "protein"
implies one type of protein. A COG or KOG comprises
often several sequences from different tardigrades.
Prokaryotic (COG) and eukaryotic (KOG) gene clusters
were compared (Table 2; details on the WEB http://water
bear.bioapps.biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de/). Again, several tardigrade-specific adaptations stand out, e.g. highly
represented COGs regulate translation elongation factor
and sulfate adenylate transferase and a strong ubiquitin
system. There are many cysteine proteases (21 proteins).
For redox protection there are 14 thioredoxin-domain

containing proteins and 75 Heme/copper-type cytochrome/quinol-like proteins as well as ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunits (15 proteins). There are ten proteins
involved in seleno-cysteine specific translation [33,34]. In
eukaryotes, selenoproteins show a mosaic occurrence,
with some organisms, such as vertebrates and algae, but
notably also tardigrades, having dozens of these proteins,
while other organisms, such as higher plants and fungi,
having lost all selenoproteins during evolution [34].
Membrane GTPases (25 proteins) are often of Lep A
(leader peptidase [35]) type in tardigrades. In general,
members of the GTPase superfamily regulate membrane
signaling pathways in all cells. However, LepA, as well as
NodO, are prokaryotic-type GTPases very similar to protein synthesis elongation factors but apparently have

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/469

membrane-related functions [35]. It is interesting to
observe this prokaryotic-type GTPase in tardigrades. We
suggest that it will have similar function as known in
other organisms and thus ensure protein translation
(elongation factor) coupled to membrane integrity and
possibly cytoskeletal rearrangement which would again
boost the tardigrade resistance to stress.
The KOGs show similar highly represented families and
adaptations. Abberant proteins are rapidly recognized by
ubiquitination-like proteins (220 proteins) and ubiquitin-ligase related enzymes (71 proteins) as well as proteasome regulatory subunits (85 proteins). For protein
protection and refolding disulfide isomerases (26 proteins) and cyclophilin type peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases (43 proteins; KOG 0879-0885) are available.
Connected to redox protection are also thirty AAA+type
ATPases and three peroxisome assembly factor 2 containing proteins (KOG0736). This broad effort in protein protection is further supported by molecular chaperones
(HSP70, mortalins and other; total of 50 proteins) and
chaperonin complex components (32 proteins;
KOG0356-0364). There are six superoxide dismutases
and six copper chaperons for thioredoxins (37 proteins),
glutaredoxin-like proteins (nine) and ten thiodisulfide
isomerases as well as 52 glutathione-S-transferases. We
found 22 hits to helicases. Tardigrade DNA protection is
represented by 52 proteins of the molecular chaperone
DNA J family: proteins of the DNA J family are classified
into 3 types according to their structural domain decomposition. Type I J proteins compose of the J domain, a glyrich region connecting the J domain and a zinc finger
domain, and possibly a C-terminal domain. Type II lacks
the Zn-finger domain and type III only contains the J
domain [36,37]. The latter two are referred to as DnaJ-like
proteins. Analysis of the domains present in tardigrade
proteins by SMART [38] and Pfam [39] searches reveals
only the J domain and in some cases a transmembrane
region, identifying them as type III DnaJ-like proteins. For
further information on these COGs/KOGs see Table 3.
Moreover, undesired proteins can be rapidly degraded by
cathepsin F-like proteins (31 proteins) or L-like proteins
(46 proteins). There are several calcium-dependent protein kinases (25 proteins; KOG0032-0034) and actinbundling proteins. According to this observation calcium
signaling should be implicated in adaptive rearrangement
of the cytoskeleton during tardigrade rehydration. The
cytoskeleton is a key element in the organisation of
eukaryotic cells. It has been described in the literature that
the properties of actin are modulated by small heat-shock
proteins including a direct actin-small heat-shock protein
interaction to inhibit actin polymerization to protect the
cytoskeleton [40,41] (compare with the CLANS cluster 24
(Diapause proteins) found in the above analysis).

(see abbreviations) and the COG/KOG annotation.

Translation in tardigrades includes polypeptide release
factors (71 proteins) and proteins for translation elongation (77 proteins). There are about 80 GTP-binding ADPribosylation factors. The secretion system and Rab/Ras
GTPases are fully represented (183 proteins). Seventeen
tubulin anchor proteins show that the cytoskeleton is well
maintained. Finally, we find 14 TNF-associated factors
and 34 apolipoprotein D/lipocalin proteins.
Typical motifs in tardigrade mRNAs
The regulatory motif search showed a number of known
regulatory RNA elements involved in tardigrade mRNA
regulation (Table 4 for H. dujardini and M. tardigradum).
Certainly it can not be formally ruled out that some of
these elements work in a tardigrade modified way. Similarly, there are probably further patterns which are tardigrade specific, but not detected with the UTRscan software
[42] applied for analysis.

The RNA elements found include the lox-P DICE element
[43] in H. dujardini as top hit with as many as 1,269 ESTs
(23.6% of all H. dujardini EST sequences). The cytidinerich 15-lipoxygenase differentiation control element (15LOX DICE, [44]) binds KH domain proteins of the type
hnRNP E and K (stronger in multiple copies), mediating
mRNA stabilization and translational control [43].
Furthermore, a high number of mRNAs contains K-Boxes
(cUGUGAUa, [45]) and brd Boxes (AGCUUUA, [46]). All
these elements are involved in mRNA storage and mRNA
stability. These two elements are potential targets for miRNAs as shown in Drosophila melanogaster [47].
However, in the two tardigrade species compared, only 16
of 30 well known RNA elements are found, suggesting a
clear bias in tardigrade mRNA regulation. For example,
the widely used AU rich elements in higher organisms
[42] such as vertebrates are absent in tardigrades [see additional file 1].
Regulatory elements in tardigrade mRNA are probably
important for their adaptation, in particular to support
transformation to tun stage and back to active stage again.
The list of RNA elements found can be compared for
instance to our data on regulatory elements in human
anucleate platelets [48] where mRNAs have to be stockpiled for the whole life of the platelet. Due to this comparatively long life, a long mRNA untranslated region is
important in these cells. The same should apply to tardigrade mRNAs, since their average UTR is predicted to be
long. A different stock-piling scenario occurs in unfertilized eggs, but due to developmental constraints, here
localization signals are often in addition important for
developmental gradients. We tested for these in tardigrades but did not find a high representation of localization motifs.

considered 5,378 ESTs in H. dujardini. 2 We considered 607 ESTs
in M. tardigradum. 3 The number of hits is followed by the number of
mRNAs with this hit in brackets to indicate multiple hits.

Web-tool tardigrade analyzer
We created a convenient platform to allow rapid sequence
comparisons of new protein sequences, in particular from
new sequencing efforts in tardigrades, to our database by
applying rapid heuristic local alignment using BLAST [49]
and allowing to search in selected species.

A batch mode allows the analysis of up to 100 sequences
simultaneously when uploaded in a file in FASTA format.
Output data are displayed according to an enhanced
BLAST output format with graphical illustrations. Low
expected E-values result for searches using the option of
our tardigrade specific databases: a more specific smaller
database reduces the probability of false positives. As an
alternative for general sequence analysis, a search against
the non-redundant database of GenBank can be performed. This takes more computational power and yields
higher E-values, however, it identifies functions for most
sequences. An additional useful feature is to scan all available data for peptide motifs or PROSITE signatures using
a "pattern" module [additional file 1: Fig. S1] or assign
potential functions by COGs [19]. The first is helpful to
recognize tardigrade proteins in cases where the tardigrade sequence has diverged far, and only critical residues
for function are still conserved as motif signatures. It can
also be applied to search for regulatory RNA motifs such
as polyadenylation sites (e.g. AAUAAA or AAUUAA) or recognize promotor modules such as the glucocorticoid
receptor element (GRE; palindromic pattern: AGAA
CAnnnTGTTCT). For this purpose, both, the tardigrade
sequences and the non redundant database can be
searched (e.g. to look for stress-specific regulatory RNA
elements; [additional file 1, Fig. S2]).

Functional clusters by CLANS of sequence related proteins
Functional clusters by CLANS of sequence related
proteins in tardigrades. All available [see additional file 1:
Figure S5] tardigrade protein sequences were clustered in a
3D sphere according to their sequence distance and were
projected to the paper plane. Individual protein functions are
colored [for color code see additional file 1: Table S1] and all
listed in Table 1. Functional clusters appear as patches of an
individual color. Color code and clusters can be interactively
examined at the Tardigrade workbench http://waterbear.bioapps.biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de and are given in [additional file 1 Table S1]. figure1.pdf

Interestingly, this nucleotide (RNA or DNA) specific
option is not available on some common servers, e.g. the
PHI-BLAST [50] server at NIH. Further options include a
user-defined database [additional file 1: Fig. S3] and interactively animated stress clusters (Figure 1).

mRNA polyadenylation sites are rapidly identified e.g. in
H. dujardini mRNAs [additional file 1: Fig. S4]. Similarly,
other mRNA 3'UTR elements can be identified, e.g. AU
rich sequences mediating mRNA instability or regulatory
K-boxes (motif cUGUGAUa, [45]) in tardigrades.

The
tool
http://waterbear.bioapps.biozentrum.uniwuerzburg.de/ allows rapid searches for tardigrade specific sequences, e.g. molecular adaptations against stress
[see additional file 1 for screenshots and a tutorial]. For
instance, a search for trehalase sequences shows no trehalase mRNA in the H. dujardini sequences. In contrast, there
are several heat shock proteins in tardigrades, an example
is HSP90 proteins (identified by sequence similarity as
well as by a pattern hit based approach using the PROSITE
entry PS00298 with the signature Y-x[NQHD][KHR]- [DE]- [IVA]-F- [LM]-R- [ED]; Table 5).
Specific COGs are also rapidly assigned for any desired
sequence. This includes the option to map the query
sequence of interest to any of the known tardigrade specific COGs. Furthermore, nucleotide patterns such as

Implications
Tardigrades show a surprising large amount of related
sequences. Certainly, one has to correct for a few genes
sequenced from many lineages for phylogenetic studies in
tardigrades (cytochrome c, rRNA etc.) However, despite
this, a number of tardigrade-specific clusters still remain.
Furthermore, Table 1 shows that most of the annotated
clusters are stress-related.

Looking at specific protein functions, both COG and KOG
proteins show that tardigrades spend an extraordinary
effort in protein protection, turnover and recycling as well
as redox protection. Some other specific adaptations
become apparent also from Table 2, but the complete
extent of these adaptations is unclear given the limited

sampling of available tardigrade sequences. Furthermore,
protection of DNA is critical as it has been shown that tardigrade tuns accumulate DNA damage which first has to
be repaired before resurrection occurs [51,52]. Taking this
into consideration, DNA J proteins were investigated in
more detail since proteins of this family are well represented in tardigrades, including several COGs and KOGs.
Several data underline the extremely high resistance of tardigrades to temperature, pressure and radiation as well as
a high repair potential regarding DNA [11,51]. Thus, we
suggest that the high repair potential is also mediated by
this well represented protein family. Phylogenetic analysis
(Table 3) shows that these proteins are represented by several KOGs as well as the classic COGs in tardigrades. In
particular, the first three KOG families are also used in M.
tardigradum, where extreme stress tolerance requires
strong repair mechanisms [17]. Furthermore, all these tardigrade proteins in Table 3 are small, having neither zincfinger domains nor low complexity regions, but instead
consisting of single DNA J domains which would always
place them in type I (subfamily A) of DNA-J like proteins.
This suggests that the direct interaction with DNA-J like
proteins is the key molecular function.
Finally, we could show that there are 16 regulatory elements used in tardigrade mRNA, while a number of other
elements known from higher eukaryotic organisms and
vertebrates is not used. It is interesting to note that the elements often used in tardigrades are all involved in regulation of mRNA stability. Thus, they may be implicated in
stage switching, as presumably in the initial phases of the
tun awakening or tun formation, new supply of mRNA is
turned off and instead regulation of synthesized mRNA
becomes important.
In addition, and for further research we supply the web
tool tardigrade analyzer. There are a number of alternative
tools available, e.g. from NCBI http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/. However, we offer some species-specific
searches not available from these sources as well as RNA
and promotor pattern search (not only for tardigrades but
also for NRDB; not available from NIH). Furthermore,
there are functional COG prediction as well as new,
unpublished tardigrade sequences from M. tardigradum,

all above reported data including the reported sequences
and detailed functional clusterings as well as regular server
updates. A better understanding of the survival mechanisms in these organisms will lead to the development of
new methods in several areas of biotechnology. For example, preservation of biological materials in situ, macromolecules and cells from non-adapted organisms [53]. This is,
of course, only a first and very general overview on potential tardigrade specific adaptations, more species-specific
data will be considered as more information becomes
available.

Conclusion
Tardigrade genomes invest in stress-specific adaptations,
this includes major sequence related protein clusters,
functional clusters for stress as well as specific regulatory
elements in mRNA. For further tardigrade genome analysis we offer the tardigrade workbench as a flexible tool for
rapid and efficient analysis of sequence similarity, protein
function and clusters, COG membership and regulatory
elements.

Methods
Tardigrade-sequences
The cosmopolitan eutardigrade species M. tardigradum
Doyére 1849 (Apochela, Milnesidae) was cultured. Tardigrades were kept and reared on petri dishes (diameter: 9.4
cm) filled with a small layer of agarose (3 %) (peqGOLD
Universal Agarose, peqLAB, Erlangen, Germany) and covered with spring water (Volvic™ water, Danone Waters
Deutschland, Wiesbaden, Germany) at 20 ± 2°C and a
light/dark cycle of 12 h. Rotifers Philodina citrina and nematodes Panagrellus sp. were provided as food source, juvenile tardigrades were also fed with green algae
Chlorogonium elongatum. For all experiments adult animals
in good physical condition were taken directly from the
culture and starved for three days to avoid preparation of
additional RNA originating from not completely digested
food in the intestinal system. For an overview of RNAs
present both in active and tun stage we used a mixture of
the same number of animals.

Total RNA extraction was performed using the QIAGEN
RNeasy®Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The cDNA

synthesis was reversed transcribed using 1 μg total RNA by
the Creator™ SMART™ cDNA Library Construction Kit
(Clontech-Takara Bio Europe, France). The resulting
cDNA was amplified following the manufacturers protocol and cloned into pDNR-Lib cloning vector. The resulting plasmids were used to transform Escherichia coli by
electroporation. Sequencing of the cDNA-library was
done by ABI 3730XL capillary sequencer (GATC Biotech
AG, Konstanz, Germany). All obtained EST sequences
were deposited with Genbank including dbEST databank.
Nucleotide sequences from other tardigrades were collected from Genbank. For H. dujardini, the best represented species, we composed 5,235 ESTs. We stored H.
dujardini as well as all published sequences of other tardigrade species (e.g. T. stephaniae, E. testudo, M. tardigradum,
R. coronifer) in a database (10,787 sequences including
translated sequences, details in [additional file 1], status
on April, 2009).
CLANS clustering
For a systematic overview on tardigrade specific adaptations we first clustered all published tardigrade nucleotide
sequences into functional clusters (Figure 1) using the
Cluster analysis of sequences (CLANS) algorithm [21]. All
sequences were clustered in 3D space using 0.001 as an Evalue cut-off for TBLASTX all-against-all searches. [additional file 1: Fig. S4].

Tardigrade workbench
The tardigrade workbench is implemented in Perl using
the Bioperl modules [54]. NCBI BLAST program of 2.2.17
is involved in the software package. A database of Postgresql 8.1.9 is applied to manage the tardigrade entries so
as to accelerate the searching queried by investigators. The
COG cluster information is automatically updated each
week and warehoused on the server. In addition, the run
of tardigrade workbench requires an Apache server, a
linux system of at least 2 GB memory is highly recommended.

Authors' contributions
FF did tardigrade protein data analysis including CLANS
clustering and RNA motif analysis. CL established the current version of the tardigrade workbench including programming new routines, data management and
nucleotide motif analysis. AS did the initial setup of the
server, of the virtual ribosome and the CLANS clustering.
DB, JE, MS and MF participated in tardigrade data analysis. TM gave expert advice and input on statistics, RS gave
expert advice on tardigrade physiology and zoology. TD
led and guided the study including analysis of data and
program, supervision, and manuscript writing. All authors
participated in the writing of the manuscript and
approved the final version.

Additional material

Identification of regulatory elements
For this the ESTs of H. dujardini and M. tardigradum were
systematically screened using the software UTRscan [42].
This software screens 30 regulatory elements for RNA regulation with a focus on 3' UTR elements and stability of
mRNA. The default settings for batch mode were used and
all reported elements were collected.
COG clustering and identification
In order to acquire a systematic overview of the functionalities, we used the latest version of COG/KOG databases
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/COG and the BLAST hits from
both nucleotide search and protein search were clustered
according to their COG ID. Searches were carried out in
parallel on all the tardigrade species including M. tardigradum, H. dujardini, E. testudo, T. stephaniae and R. coronifer.
The results are summarized in a table shown in the tardigrade analyzer, the background color from cold to warm
(blue to red) indicates the cluster size, which enables an
easy comparison. Moreover, users are allowed to click the
COG ID and the hit number. The server then reports the
corresponding sequence ID, description, conservation
and the homologous entries recorded in the database. The
server with its data is automatically updated bi-monthly
according to the latest tardigrade databases.
