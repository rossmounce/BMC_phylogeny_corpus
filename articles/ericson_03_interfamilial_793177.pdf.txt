Abstract
Background: Phylogenetic hypotheses of higher-level relationships in the order Charadriiformes
based on morphological data, partly disagree with those based on DNA-DNA hybridisation data.
So far, these relationships have not been tested by analysis of DNA sequence data. Herein we
utilize 1692 bp of aligned, nuclear DNA sequences obtained from 23 charadriiform species,
representing 15 families. We also test earlier suggestions that bustards and sandgrouses may be
nested with the charadriiforms. The data is analysed with methods based on the parsimony and
maximum-likelihood criteria.
Results: Several novel phylogenetic relationships were recovered and strongly supported by the
data, regardless of which method of analysis was employed. These include placing the gulls and allied
groups as a sistergroup to the sandpiper-like birds, and not to the plover-like birds. The auks clearly
belong to the clade with the gulls and allies, and are not basal to most other charadriiform birds as
suggested in analyses of morphological data. Pluvialis, which has been supposed to belong to the
plover family (Charadriidae), represents a basal branch that constitutes the sister taxon to a clade
with plovers, oystercatchers and avocets. The thick-knees and sheathbills unexpectedly cluster
together.
Conclusion: The DNA sequence data contains a strong phylogenetic signal that results in a wellresolved phylogenetic tree with many strongly supported internodes. Taxonomically it is the most
inclusive study of shorebird families that relies on nucleotide sequences. The presented
phylogenetic hypothesis provides a solid framework for analyses of macroevolution of ecological,
morphological and behavioural adaptations observed within the order Charadriiformes.

Background
The order Charadriiformes (shorebirds) comprises 343
species divided into 18 families (sensu del Hoyo et al [1],
whose taxonomic nomenclature is followed here, Table
1). Following Peters [2] the families are placed in three
suborders; Alcae, Lari and Charadrii. The Alcae contains a

single family, Alcidae (auks, puffins, murrelets and allies),
while the Lari is comprised of the Stercorariidae (skuas
and jaegers), Laridae (gulls), Sternidae (terns and noddies) and Rynchopidae (skimmers) The largest and most
diverse assemblage is the Charadrii comprising the
remaining 13 families.

Morphological support for monophyly of the Charadriiformes is weak and conflicting hypotheses of charadriiform relationships have been proposed based on analysis
of morphological, osteological, and genetic characters. In
a detailed osteological study of the order, which included
227 charadriiform taxa, Strauch [3] identified three lineages, Alcae, Scolopaci and Charadrii (Fig. 1). The Scolopaci comprised the Jacanidae (jacanas), Rostratulidae
(painted snipe), Scolopacidae (sandpipers, stints, snipe,
curlews and allies) and Thinocoridae (seedsnipe). The
Charadrii comprised the Dromadidae (Crab Plover), Haematopodidae, Ibidorhynchidae, Recurvirostridae, Burhinidae, Glareolidae, Charadriidae, Chionidae (sheathbills),
Stercorariidae, Laridae, Sternidae and Rynchopidae while
the Alcae comprised only the Alcidae. Strauch's [3] analysis could not resolve the affinities between the three lineages but reanalyses of the data by Mickevich and Parenti
[4], Björklund [5] and Chu [6] identified Alcae as the
basal lineage. Additionally, Björklund's [5] reanalysis
placed the Charadriidae within the Scolopaci suggesting it
formed a monophyletic clade with the Scolopacidae, Jacanidae and Rostratulidae. Consistent with the osteological
data, Jehl's [7] analysis of downy young plumage patterns
within the Charadrii supported a relationship between the
Haematopidae, Ibidorhynchidae, Recurvirostridae, Burhinidae, Glareolidae and Charadriidae.
Sibley and Ahlquist [8] using DNA-DNA hybridisation
data for 69 charadriiform identified only two major lineages; the Scolopaci of Strauch [3] together with Pediono-

midae (plains-wanderer) and an expanded Charadrii
comprising the remaining families (Fig. 2). A protein
allozyme study by Christian et al. [9] also confirmed that
the Burhinidae, Haematopodidae, Recurvirostridae and
Charadriidae represented an assemblage distinct from the
Scolopacidae. The protein study could not confirm a close
association between the Laridae and the Charadriidae
assemblage or between the Scolopacidae and Jacanidae,
but did suggest a sister relationship between the Lari and
the Glareolidae.
While in broad agreement with the studies of Strauch [3]
and Chu [6] the DNA-DNA hybridisation data of Sibley
and Ahlquist [8] did not identify auks (Alcidae) as a separate lineage instead placing them as the sister taxon to
gulls, terns, skimmers and skuas. Moreover, alternative
relationships were recovered from the data when different
tree-building algorithms were applied. This resulted in the
gulls and their allies being placed as the sister group to the

sandpiper-like birds rather than to the plover-like birds
(op. cit. fig. 337). Several other differences occur between
the results produced by the various datasets. For example,
the Scolopacidae was found to be monophyletic in the
analyses of Strauch [3] and Sibley and Ahlquist [8], while
Chu [6] and Mickevich and Parenti [4] found the scolopacids to be paraphyletic. Obviously, the higher-level
phylogeny of the shorebirds is still ambiguous. In this
paper we investigate if DNA sequence data can be used to
produce a more robust hypothesis of charadriiform
relationships.
The choice of molecular markers becomes critical when
old divergences are studied. Although the times of divergences among the extant charadriiform lineages are
largely unknown, fossils of extinct groups commonly
referred to the order Charadriiformes occur already in
deposits dated to the Late Cretaceous [10]. The oldest fossils assigned to modern families of charadriiforms date
from the late Tertiary [11,12]. It can thus be safely
assumed that some branches in the phylogenetic tree for
these taxa date back to the early Tertiary, if not longer. This
is in agreement with the assumption, based on biogeogra-

phy and molecular-clock models, that the evolution and
diversification of several orders and families of extant
birds have occurred in the late Cretaceous or Early
Tertiary, some 100 to 50 mya [13–17]. It should be noted,
however, that estimates of divergence times based on the
fossil record are generally lower than those based on
molecular data [18].
The old age of many bird taxa presents one explanation of
why their higher-level systematic relationships have been
difficult to resolve using mitochondrial sequence data
[16,19,20]. The mitochondrial genes most commonly
used in these studies (cytochrome b and 12S) are normally assumed to evolve at a rate of ~1% per million years
[21]. It has been argued that the cytochrome b gene gives
reliable information in birds only for divergences younger
than 9 million years [22], i.e. evolutionary events considerably younger than the evolution of most modern orders
and families. Thus, to use DNA sequence data to resolve
higher-level branching patterns among birds requires
molecular markers that evolve considerably slower than
the mitochondrial genome.
In recent years nuclear genes have been utilized for this
purpose. The most commonly used nuclear markers are
the protein-encoding c-myc, RAG-1, and c-mos genes with

the former two evolving at rates 4 to 12 times slower than
the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene in the same taxa
(Ericson pers. obs.). The evolutionary rates of these genes
may, however, be too slow for many studies as the
number of mutations observed to accumulate between
evolutionary branching events can be very low. This
results in short internodes with poor statistical support in
the phylogenetic tree, which in turn makes the phylogenetic hypotheses weak. To enhance studies of mediumold (ca 20–60 my) divergences in birds it is desirable to
find molecular markers with slightly faster evolutionary
rates than the protein-encoding nuclear genes used so far,
and introns in nuclear genes may provide such markers.

gruence between individual gene trees increases the probability that they represent the true evolutionary history of
the group.

Herein we use an intron positioned in the myoglobin
gene, which has proven especially useful to resolve relationships among passerine birds [23–25], in addition to
the protein-encoding RAG-1 gene. By using two independent molecular markers we can also compare the phylogenetic signal produced by each genic region. While a
tree based on a single gene or region may be misleading
purely because of stochastic factors [26,27], observed con-

Despite sequencing in both directions with several primers, certain nucleotide positions could not be determined
unambiguously. This relates to 24 positions in the RAG-1
sequences (0.1%), and 48 positions in the myoglobin
sequences (0.3%). The observed polymorphisms may be
due to true heterozygosity in the individual, but also to
PCR or sequencing artefacts.

Results
Molecular variation and base compositions
A segment of 930 homologous base pairs from RAG-1 was
obtained from all taxa with no indels detected. Sequences
for the myoglobin intron II ranged from 693 base pairs
(Alca torda, Larus fuscus) to 734 base pairs (Afrotis atra).
The intron exhibited several indels, of which two were
phylogenetically informative (one between positions 38
and 48, and the other between positions 532 and 544).

After alignment the data matrix consisted of 1692 base
pairs, of which 930 base pairs derive from RAG-1 and 762
base pairs from myoglobin intron II. In RAG-1, 644
positions (69%) were constant, 164 (18%) were variable
but not phylogenetically informative, while 122 (13%)
were potentially informative. In myoglobin intron II 395
positions (52%) were constant, 207 (27%) variable but
not phylogenetically informative, and 160 (21%) were
potentially informative.
Sequence distances and patterns of substitutions
In RAG-1 the uncorrected sequence divergences between
charadriiform taxa ranged from 0.1% (Catharacta vs. Stercorarius) to 7.1% (Chionis vs.Thinocorus) (Table 2, see
Additional file 1). Divergences between charadriiform
taxa and the columbiforms (dove and sandgrouse) and
gruiforms (bustard and crane), ranged from 2.4% to
7.1%. Generally, larger distances were observed in comparisons involving the outgroup megapod and screamer
(5.5% to 9.7%). The corresponding ranges in sequence

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/3/16

divergences for myoglobin intron II were from less than
0.1% (Catharacta vs. Stercorarius) to 10.3% (Cursorius
vs.Jacana) within the charadriiforms, from 6.1% to 14.6%
between the charadriiforms and the columbiforms and
gruiforms, and from 9.5% to 17.1% in comparisons
involving the outgroups (Table 2, see Additional file 1).
The pairwise sequence divergences were higher, on average, in myoglobin intron II than in RAG-1.
Neither RAG-1, nor myoglobin intron II, showed any sign
of saturation with both transitions and transversions linearly related to the observed pairwise sequence distances,
with no obvious tendency to level off (Figs. 4,5). A plot of
the pairwise, uncorrected sequence distances observed in
RAG-1 and myoglobin intron II, respectively, showed an
almost linear relationship between the two genic regions
(Fig. 6). The slope of the regression line estimated to fit
these data indicates that the myoglobin intron II evolves
at a rate that is about 60% faster than that in RAG-1.

Phylogenetic relationships
Parsimony and maximum-likelihood analyses of the
combined sequence data yielded virtually identical tree
topologies, as did the parsimony analyses of the individual genic regions (Figs. 7,8,9). The parsimony analyses
yielded four most parsimonious trees (length 1128 steps,
consistency index [CI] 0.71, retention index [RI] 0.60) for
the combined data set, 72 most parsimonious trees
(length 483, CI 0.70, RI 0.60) for RAG-1, and 76 most parsimonious trees (length 639, CI 0.72, RI 0.61) for
myoglobin intron II. Bootstrap values and Bayesian support values are indicated in the trees.

Monophyly of the Charadriiformes (sensu [1]) is strongly
supported by the combined data set, with a bootstrap
value of 94% in the maximum parsimony (MP) tree (Fig.
8), and a 100% Bayesian support in the maximum-likelihood (ML) tree (Fig. 7). Neither the sandgrouse (Pteroclididae) nor bustard (Otididae) clustered within the
Charadriiformes, nor does either taxon unambiguously
form the sister-group.

There is strong bootstrap support in both the parsimony
and maximum-likelihood analyses for a division of the
order into two major clades. The first consists of
sandpiper-like birds (representing the families Scolopacidae, Jacanidae, Rostratulidae, Thinocoridae) along with
gulls and their allies (Laridae, Sternidae, Rynchopidae,
Stercorariidae), auks (Alcidae) and the coursers (Glareolidae). The second consists of plover-like birds
(representing Charadriidae, Haematopodidae, Recurvirostridae) along with the sheathbill (Chionidae) and
thick-knee (Burhinidae).
Within the first clade, two subclades are evident. One,
comprising Alcidae, Stercorariidae, Laridae, Sternidae,
Rynchopidae, and Glareolidae is strongly supported (MP:
100%, Bayesian: 100%) and defined by a synapomorphic
indel between positions 532 and 544 in the myoglobin
intron II. Relationships within this clade cannot be determined with certainty, but there is support (MP: 61%,
Bayesian: 100%) for a dichotomy between Glareolidae
and the rest. This dichotomy is also supported by a

synapomorphic indel, between positions 38 and 48 of the
myoglobin intron II. The second subclade comprises the
family Scolopacidae (Arenaria, Calidris, Tringa, Phalaropus,
Gallinago) that is sistergroup to a clade consisting of
Jacanidae, Thinocoridae and Rostratulidae. The relationships within Scolopacidae are more difficult to determine

although Gallinago is identified as the sister to all the others, in both trees. The relationships between Jacanidae,
Thinocoridae and Rostratulidae cannot be established,
although they appear to constitute a monophyletic group.

Rostratulidae group together, with Thinocoridae as their
sister. The low nodal support values indicate that the relationships between these three taxa are effectively
unresolved in the present analyses. Furthermore, Alcidae
is the sister to Glareolidae in the myoglobin tree, and to
Stercorariidae in the RAG-1 tree, but neither suggestion
receives bootstrap support.

Maximum parsimony analysis
Maximum parsimony analysis Strict consensus tree calculated from the four most parsimonious trees (length 1116
steps, CI 0.71, RI 0.60) based on the combined data set.

Within the second major clade a relationship between
Burhinidae and Chionidae was strongly supported (MP:
99%, Bayesian: 100%), and a lineage including Charadriidae, Vanellidae, Recurvirostridae and Haematopodidae
(MP: 94%, Bayesian: 100%) constitutes their sistergroup.
The family Charadriidae is not recovered as monophyletic. Instead, Charadrius (Charadriidae) and Vanellus
(Vanellidae) group together, with Recurvirostra (Recurvirostridae) and Haematopus (Haematopodidae) as their sister. Pluvialis (considered as belonging to Charadriidae)
falls outside these four taxa.
There are two contradictions between the trees based on
RAG-1 and myoglobin intron II, respectively (Fig. 9).
According to the myoglobin intron II tree, Jacanidae and
Thinocoridae constitute one group, and this group is the
sister to Rostratulidae. In the RAG-1 tree, Jacanidae and

Utility of the RAG-1 and myoglobin intron II sequences
Both nuclear DNA regions examined here were suitable
for phylogenetic analyses at this taxonomic level as neither showed any sign of saturation in the present data set.
This was expected for RAG-1 based on previous results
obtained for analyses of avian data sets [24,28–30] but
was unexpected for the non-coding myoglobin intron II.
Slade et al. [31] and Lessa [32] have previously advocated
the use of nuclear introns as markers for resolving patterns
of intra-specific differentiation in vertebrates and this
approach has been adopted in population genetic studies
of birds [33,34]. More recently, nuclear introns have been
used to reconstruct species-level phylogenies [35–41].
Their application at this taxonomic level is supported by
comparative studies, which suggest that beta-fibrinogen
intron 7 contains similar phylogenetic signal to the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene in birds [36]. Based on these
limited findings, saturation of nuclear intron sequences
and poor phylogenetic resolution might logically be
expected to occur at higher taxonomic levels. This was not
observed for myoglobin intron II in the present data set,
which examined intra-ordinal relationships. Despite its
non-coding function myoglobin intron II appeared to
evolve at a rate only about 60% faster than that of the
RAG-1 gene.
Phylogenetic relationships
The analysis of the concatenated nuclear DNA sequences
strongly supports monophyly of the charadriiform order,
albeit that the two genes provide markedly less support
when analysed individually. Contrary to certain previous
suggestions [11,42,43] there is no support for the placement of the sandgrouse or bustard within the
charadriiforms. Neither do the data provide strong support for a link between the Columbiformes and Charadriiformes with the two columbiform outgroups (Pterocles
and Scardafella) occurring basal in the maximum-likelihood tree and as part of an unsupported basal polytomy
in the maximum-parsimony analysis.

The charadriiform families clearly divide into three clades
consistent with DNA-DNA hybridisation data although
the relationships among these clades differ from those
reported by [8]. One of the best-supported groupings of
charadriiform families in the present analysis consists of
the Lari (gulls, terns, skimmers and jaegers) along with the

Comparison between the two gene trees
Comparison between the two gene trees Strict consensus trees from parsimony analyses of the RAG-1 and the
myoglobin intron II data sets, respectively. The RAG-1 tree is calculated from the 72 most parsimonious trees (length 483

0.62).

Alcae (auks, puffins, murrelets and allies) and glareolids
(coursers and pratincoles). This group constitutes the
Laroidea of [8] and has never been suggested as forming a
monophyletic group on the basis of morphology. The
auks and their allies, considered basal in morphological
analyses [4–6], are clearly nested within the Lari and form
the sister group to the Stercorariidae (skuas and jaegers) in
most analyses. The Glareolidae are basal in this group.
Although the taxonomic boundaries of the Glareolidae
have been disputed it is most often considered to include
six genera Glareola, Cursorius, Rhinoptilus, Smutsornis, Stiltia

and Pluvianus, of which only two were studied herein.
Given the uncertainty about the monophyly of
Glareolidae, it is worth noting that the DNA-DNA hybridization study included two other glareolid genera (Glareola and Stiltia) than those used herein (Cursorius and
Rhinoptilus).
Relationships within the Lari are not firmly resolved by
the present data, although the relationships suggested,
with the skimmers (Rynchopidae) as sister to gulls and
terns (Laridae and Sternidae) and skuas (Stercorariidae)

Page 9 of 14

basal are identical to the results based on DNA-DNA
hybridization and consistent with the morphological
analyses of Schnell [44,45]. In comparing 51
measurements from skeletal elements among 93 species
of jaegers, skuas, gulls, terns, and skimmers, Schnell concluded that skimmers are most similar to terns, and that
the differences between jaegers and gulls are greater than
those between gulls and terns.
The remaining Charadrii families included in this study
divide into two clades, one comprising the sandpiper-like
birds (Scolopacidae, Jacanidae and Thinocoridae), and
the other the plover-like birds (Charadiidae,
Recurvirostridae, Haemtopodidae) along with sheathbills
(Chionidae) and thick-knees (Burhinidae). The sandpiper-like birds unambiguously form the sistergroup to the
Lari-Alcae-glareolid clade with strong bootstrap support
in both methods of analysis (MP: 81%, Bayesian: 100%).
This systematic arrangement is rather unusual. Based on
morphology, the gulls and allies have traditionally been
placed together with the plover-like birds [3,6], a relationship also suggested by UPGMA analysis of DNA-DNA
hybridization data [8]. However, the application of an
alternative clustering algorithm (FITCH) to the DNADNA hybridization data groups the gull and allies with
the sandpiper-like birds [[8]: fig. 337], in accordance with
the results of the present study.
The clade containing the sandpiper-like birds includes a
well-supported, monophyletic group of scolopacid taxa,
and a likewise well-supported group consisting of the
jacana, painted snipe and seedsnipe. Relationships
among the latter three taxa are unresolved although maximum-likelihood analysis, skeletal morphology [3] and
the down patterns of the young [7] suggest a closer relationship between jacanas and painted-snipes. Their sister
clade includes all scolopacid representatives included in
the study with the snipe (Gallinago) as the basal taxon and
a sister-relationship between the turnstone (Arenaria) and
sandpiper (Calidris) recovered in all analyses. These scolopacid relationships agree well with the results based on
DNA-DNA hybridization data. Neither the low (60%)
support for this clade in the maximum-likelihood analysis, nor the likewise low (0.3) delta-T50 value in the study
of the DNA-DNA hybridization data, allow strong
hypotheses about the evolutionary relationships between
phalaropes, shanks, and other scolopacids to be
formulated.
The remaining clade containing the plover-like birds
(plover, lapwing, avocet and oystercatcher), sheathbill
and thick-knee is basal in the phylogeny. The intra-relationships of this clade match closely those suggested by
DNA-DNA hybridization data, and only the position of
the plover Pluvialis differs. In the DNA-DNA hybridization

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/3/16

study Pluvialis groups adjacent to a clade containing the
plover (Charadrius) and lapwing, while the present data
places it basal to all other plover-like birds including the
oystercatcher and avocet. The distinctiveness of Pluvialis
and its basal position relative to other plover-like birds is
also supported by the allozyme data of [9]. It is highly
unexpected that the oystercatchers and avocets should be
nested within the Charadriidae, as suggested by the
present data, and this issue needs further investigation.
The analysis of the sequence data places a clade with the
thick-knee and sheathbill as the sistergroup to the ploverlapwing-oystercatcher-avocet group, but the branch
leading to this larger clade is short and receives no statistical support. The relationship between the thick-knee
(Burhinus) and sheathbill (Chionis) is well supported,
however. As with many other systematic relationships
supported by the DNA sequence data analysed herein, the
grouping of the thick-knee with the sheathbill is unexpected when morphology and general behaviour are
taken into consideration. However, the same relationship
is strongly suggested by Paton et al. [46] who analyzed
DNA sequences obtained from the complete RAG-1 gene.

Conclusions
The DNA sequence data obtained from two segments of
the nuclear genome provides independent estimates of
the phylogenetic relationships of the charadriiform birds.
The great similarity between the two resulting phylogenies
suggests that the concatenated data set can be used to infer
the true evolutionary history of the group. Parsimony and
maximum-likelihood analyses of the combined
sequences resulted in a well-resolved phylogenetic tree
with many strongly supported internodes. The DNA
sequence data suggests that the order Charadriiformes is
monophyletic, and that the sandgrouses and bustards are
not part of it. It is also suggested that the order be divided
into two major groups. In the first, a clade of gulls, terns,
skimmers, auks and jaegers forms the sistergroup of the
coursers and pratincoles, while another clade, consisting
of scolopacids (sandpipers and allied groups), jacanas,
painted-snipes and seedsnipes, constitutes the sistergroup
of them. The second major group of charadriiform birds
consists of, on one hand, the plovers, lapwings, oystercatchers and avocets, and the thick-knees and sheathbills
on the other. The presented phylogenetic hypothesis provides a solid framework for analyses of macroevolution of
ecological and behavioural adaptations observed within
the order Charadriiformes.

Materials and Methods
Taxon selection
23 individuals representing 15 of the 18 families of the
order Charadriiformes were selected for study (Table 3).

ocally demonstrated by morphology, we also included
representatives of two taxa that have been proposed to be
close to the shorebirds, or nested within them [cf.
[11,42,43]]. These are a sandgrouse (Pterocles gutturalis,
Pteroclididae) and a bustard (Afrotis atra, Otididae). As
the alternative systematic positions of these two taxa are
with the pigeons and the gruiform birds, respectively, two
representatives of these were also included (Scardafella
squammata, Columbidae, and Grus canadensis, Gruidae). As outgroups, we include a screamer (Chauna
torquata, Anhimidae) and a megapod (Alectura lathami,
Megapodiidae) which are members of the Galloanserae,
the presumed sistergroup to Neoaves (sensu [47]) to
which the shorebirds belong.
Extraction, amplification, and sequencing
DNA was extracted from tissue or blood specimens using
the QIAamp® DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN®) following the
manufacturer's recommendations, or by standard techniques of Proteinase K/SDS digestion followed by phenol

chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, as
described in [48]. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
amplifications were carried out with Ready-To-Go® PCR
Beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden),
with 1 µl of each primer, 22 µl distilled water, and 1 µl
template. Different combinations of four primers: R17,
R22, R50, and R51 were used for the amplification of
RAG-1 [28,29] using a step-down PCR protocol. This
involved an initial soak at 94°C for 5 min, followed by
four cycles of 94°C for 40 s, 63°C for 60 s, and 72°C for
60 s, followed by four cycles at 60°C annealing and 32
cycles at an annealing temperature of 55°C with the same
temperatures and intervals. There was a final soak; 72°C
for 5 min. Myoglobin intron II was amplified using the
primer Myo2 in combination with Myo3F or Myo3
[31,49]. For some taxa nested PCR was used, whereby the
Myo2/Myo3 amplicon was re-amplified with Myo2/
Myo3F. Thermocycling procedures for the myoglobin
intron began with a soak at 94°C for 5 min, followed by

Page 11 of 14

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2003, 3

40 cycles of 94°C for 40 s, 59°C for 40 s and 72°C for 5
min and completed with a final soak at 72°C for 5 min.
The products from the PCR were purified using
QIAquick™ PCR purification Kit (QIAGEN®), and then
sequenced with Perkin Elmer Applied BioSystems 377
automated fluorescent sequencing instruments, and Perkin Elmer Applied BioSystems PRISM terminator cycle
sequencing kits, with AmpliTaq FS polymerase with
BigDye terminators. Both strands were sequenced.
Sequencing of myoglobin intron II was performed using
the primers Myo2, Myo3F, Myoint.c and Myoint.nc
[25,31,49]. The segment corresponds to the region
between positions 303 (exon 2) and 400 (exon 3) in
humans (GenBank XM009949) and includes the complete intron II, as well as 13 and 10 base pairs of the
flanking exons 2 and 3, respectively [49]. RAG-1 was
sequenced using the primers R50, R51, R52, and R53 [29].
The fragment obtained corresponds to positions 1054–
1983 in the published chicken sequence [50].
Sequences for Chauna torquata and Alectura lathami have
been published previously [28,30,51]. New sequences
were deposited in GenBank (AY339073-AY339126).
Data analysis
The multiple segments obtained by sequencing with different primers were assembled to complete sequences
using SEQMAN II™ (DNASTAR®). When nucleotides
could not be unambiguously determined the IUB coding
system [52] was used. The combined sequences were then
aligned by eye with MEGALIGN™ (DNASTAR®). The
sequences are deposited in GenBank (accession numbers
AY339073-AY339126).

MEGA 2.0 [53] was used to determine nucleotide variation and divergence values. To investigate the extent of
saturation in RAG-1 and the myoglobin intron the
number of transitions and transversions were plotted
against uncorrected sequence divergence (p-distance).
This was done to determine whether RAG-1 should be
partitioned in order to down-weight saturated positions
and to assess the phylogenetic usefulness of the non-coding myoglobin intron at these taxonomic levels. In
addition, the pairwise uncorrected sequence divergences
for the two genic regions were plotted against each other
to compare their evolutionary properties.

bisection-reconnection (TBR) branch-swapping. Ten
random additions were performed to reduce the risk of
finding local optima only. Data were unweighted and
coded as unordered. Gaps were treated as missing values.
Strict consensus trees were generated and nodal supports
estimated with 1000 bootstrap replicates with a 50%
majority rule applied.
MODELTEST 3.06 [55] was used to choose the model of
substitutions for the maximum-likelihood analysis of the
combined data set. This program determines the simplest
model of evolution that cannot be rejected in favour of a
more complex one that gives a significantly better tree.
The model chosen for the analysis was the GTR + Γ + I
time-reversible model for nucleotide substitutions, with
six types of substitutions and the proportions of invariable sites and shape parameter alpha estimated (I = 0.212
and α = 1.105). These estimates were used in a heuristic
search with TBR branch-swapping. Ten random additions
of taxa were performed. A Bayesian inference analysis was
performed using MRBAYES 2.01 [56], with the Markov
chain Monte Carlo method. 400,000 generations were
run and every hundredth tree after stabilisation was saved.
The remaining 3000 trees were imported into PAUP*
4.0b10 [54], and posterior probabilities were obtained
from the 50% majority-rule consensus tree calculated
from these.

Added in proofs
An analysis of DNA sequences of the entire RAG-1 gene (c.
2.9 kb) obtained from representatives of a similar set of
taxa as studied herein will shortly be published by Paton
et al. [46]. The two studies are entirely independent but
arrive at very similar conclusions about phylogenetic relationships within the Charadriiformes. The studies
complement each other despite having analyzed partly
overlapping DNA sequences obtained from the RAG-1
gene. Although we studied a shorter stretch (930 bp) of
the RAG-1 gene than did Paton et al., we also included
information from a second nuclear marker (myoglobin
intron II). The low degree of conflicts observed between
the RAG-1 and myoglobin gene trees, along with the general agreement between the studies of Paton et al. and ourselves, lend confidence to the hypothesis that the
observed phylogenetic patterns accurately reflect the evolutionary history of the shorebirds.

Authors' contributions
Parsimony and maximum-likelihood analyses were performed using PAUP* 4.0b10 [54], designating Chauna
torquata and Alectura lathami as outgroups. Parsimony
analyses were performed for the two genic regions separately, and for both genic regions combined. Searches for
most parsimonious trees were done under the heuristic
search option, with random additions of taxa and tree
