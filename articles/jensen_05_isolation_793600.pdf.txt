Abstract
Background: The population genetic pattern known as "isolation by distance" results from
spatially limited gene flow and is a commonly observed phenomenon in natural populations.
However, few software programs exist for estimating the degree of isolation by distance among
populations, and they tend not to be user-friendly.
Results: We have created Isolation by Distance Web Service (IBDWS) a user-friendly web
interface for determining patterns of isolation by distance. Using this site, population geneticists can
perform a variety of powerful statistical tests including Mantel tests, Reduced Major Axis (RMA)
regression analysis, as well as calculate FST between all pairs of populations and perform basic
summary statistics (e.g., heterozygosity). All statistical results, including publication-quality scatter
plots in Postscript format, are returned rapidly to the user and can be easily downloaded.
Conclusion: IBDWS population genetics analysis software is hosted at http://phage.sdsu.edu/
~jensen/ and documentation is available at http://www.bio.sdsu.edu/pub/andy/IBD.html. The source
code has been made available on Source Forge at http://sourceforge.net/projects/ibdws/.

Background
The term "isolation by distance" (IBD) was first used by
Sewall Wright [1,2] to describe patterns of population
genetic variation that derive from spatially limited gene
flow. IBD is defined as a decrease in the genetic similarity
among populations as the geographic distance between
them increases. Statistical tests for IBD can be conducted
using populations or individuals as the units of replication, although analyses at the individual level typically
utilize spatial autocorrelation statistics [3]. When individuals can be grouped into populations, it is possible to calculate 1) a matrix of genetic similarity or distance between
all population pairs for comparison with 2) a matrix of
pairwise geographic distances. A nonparametric Mantel
test is typically used to test for non-random associations

between these two matrices. Bohonak [4] has also suggested performing statistical tests of the IBD slope and
intercept using bootstrapped pseudoreplicates, and
recently, Yang [5] has developed a likelihood-based
approach for IBD analysis. The ever-growing volume of
population genetic data and a continued desire to interpret spatial processes make computational tools for rapidly identifying patterns of isolation by distance highly
desirable.
In this paper we describe a sophisticated, yet user-friendly,
Common Gateway Interface (CGI) implementation of
statistical software for detecting IBD patterns. Isolation by
Distance Web Service (IBDWS) is a major expansion and
upgrade of Isolation By Distance (IBD), a standalone

computer program written in C and originally compiled
for Windows and Macintosh [4]. IBDWS includes the following highly useful features for analysis of genetic structure in natural populations:
(1) Analysis of raw data: For a raw data set with codominant markers (e.g., microsatellites), IBDWS calculates
basic summary statistics including heterozygosity, FST
between all pairs of populations, and standard transformations of FST.
(2) Statistical tests: IBDWS performs Mantel tests, partial
Mantel tests, reduced major axis (RMA) regression of IBD
slope and intercept, and error estimation for slope and
intercept using multiple methods.
(3) Simple form interface: Various parameters (e.g.,
number of randomizations) are easily configured on the
IBDWS front page and are checked for validity.
(4) Analysis selection: Multiple analyses may be performed via checkbox selections.
(5) Publication quality graphics: IBD scatter plots are generated in Postscript format for download and further
modification.
(6) Rapid analysis: IBDWS is hosted on a fast server with
minimal wait times (see Results and discussion).
The majority of these features were not included in IBD.
Additionally, IBDWS includes thirty-one updates and bug
fixes to the original IBD statistical package. Altogether,
these changes make IBDWS a major advancement on the
original release in terms of both performance and utility.

Implementation
IBDWS was written in C++, compiled with the Unix g++
compiler, and runs on a server using Apache 2.0.50 and
Fedora Linux. Postscript file plotting capability (see
below) was implemented using CGraph, a C++ plotting
library. The UNIX command "convert" is called by IBDWS
to create a JPEG for web-based viewing from the postscript
file. Both files are held on the server for 24 hours until
routine deletion.
Depending on the specific configuration options, IBDWS
performs four primary functions. The first is generating
standard summary statistics from raw data (if provided).
These include a matrix of the genetic distance FST [1]
between all pairs of populations, and several standard
transformations of this statistic [see [6,7]]. Second, the
scatter plot of genetic vs. geographic distance is generated
in JPEG format (for viewing on the web page) and in vector-based Postscript format (for downloading and manip-

ulating in a graphics design program). The Reduced major
axis regression line overlays the plot (see Figure 1). An
algorithm that evaluates the range of values on each axis
chooses an appropriate set of evenly spaced units for
labelling.
Third, IBDWS assesses whether there is a statistically significant relationship between the genetic distance (or similarity) matrix and the comparable matrix of geographic
distances. As in other software applications, a Mantel test
[8] is used to test this relationship, as it properly accounts
for the population as the unit of replication, rather than
population pairs (i.e., the matrix entries). In addition,
IBDWS calculates the slope and intercept of the IBD relationship using reduced major axis (RMA) regression. RMA
regression is more appropriate than standard linear regression when both the dependent and the independent variables are measured with error. Error for the slope and
intercept are estimated using standard linear approximations, using a one-delete jackknife across population
pairs, and by bootstrapping pseudoreplicates over independent population pairs (see [4] and the online IBD manual). The final two methods are preferred, as they correctly
treat the population as the unit of replication. Figure 2
provides examples of IBDWS statistical output.
Different researchers have recommended logarithmic
(base 10) transformation of genetic distance, geographic
distance or both, prior to IBD analysis [6,9]. IBDWS automatically performs each of these transformations and provides an interface that switches among the four possible
scatter plots.

Results and discussion
Input
IBDWS analyzes genetic data with or without corresponding geographical information. Without geographic distances, summary statistics can be calculated from raw data
sets that include diploid genotypes at one or more loci.
These statistics include heterozygosity, and estimates of
genetic similarity between all population pairs. The additional input of geographic distance between all population pairs facilitates the variety of IBD calculations
described above. The geographic distance matrix can be
calculated using simple Euclidean distances, or with more
complex algorithms that follow biologically relevant
landscape features. Input data can be uploaded as an
ASCII text file or the data can be inserted into an HTML
form on the IBDWS web page (Figure 3). White space
delimiters are used between fields. If the population
genetic distance matrix is entered directly (rather than
individual-level data), the input file may be in matrix or
list format (examples of each are provided on the IBDWS
home page). Indicator labels (e.g., GENETIC_DISTANCE,
GEOGRAPHIC_DISTANCE) are required to separate

geographic distances, replacement values for undefined
transformations, and the number of bootstrap randomizations per analysis (up to 30,000).
Output
A full analysis of raw data for six loci, two to three alleles
per locus, and 326 individuals required an average wait
time of 10 seconds. When an input without any geographic distances is used, wait times are negligible. If raw
genotypic data are supplied, IBDWS returns an HTML
table with basic summary statistics, the genetic distance
FST between all population pairs, the genetic similarity statistic M [6] between all population pairs, and Rousset's [7]

distance FST / (1 - FST) if desired. If geographic distances
are included, IBDWS will display a scatter plot of genetic
distance vs. geographic distance for all pairs of populations, and overlay the RMA regression line (Figure 1). If
log-transformation of the data is selected, a pull-down
menu below the plot allows the user to choose data sets
with one or both axes log-transformed. Clicking on any
plot downloads a Postscript version to the user's computer. Statistical analyses of the IBD relationship, including
Mantel tests, partial Mantel tests (if appropriate) and the
RMA regression analyses described above, are summarized in HTML tables as well. A summary of all analyses
can downloaded as a static HTML file, or a tab-delimited

Future developments
At present, IBDWS requires the user to calculate all pairwise genetic distances between populations for DNA data
sets. In future versions, we plan to include algorithms for
calculating genetic distances using both sequence and
allelic data, including genetic distances based on phylogenetic trees under different models of evolution. When
implemented, the user will simply have to supply the raw
data and geographic distances before calculations are performed. IBDWS will also be updated with new population
genetics analyses as they become available.

Conclusion

5.

In summary, IBDWS is a substantial expansion of the previous PC-based versions of IBD, providing geneticists with
a simple interface, multiple statistical calculations, rapid
analysis, and high-quality graphics. It will be useful to a
significant number of molecular ecology, conservation
genetics, population genetics and genomics researchers,
and will be updated with newer analyses in the future.
