Abstract
Background: Small bacterial RNAs (sRNAs) have been shown to participate in the regulation of gene expression
and have been identified in numerous prokaryotic species. Some of them are involved in the regulation of
virulence in pathogenic bacteria. So far, little is known about sRNAs in Bordetella, and only very few sRNAs have
been identified in the genome of Bordetella pertussis, the causative agent of whooping cough.
Results: An in silico approach was used to predict sRNAs genes in intergenic regions of the B. pertussis genome.
The genome sequences of B. pertussis, Bordetella parapertussis, Bordetella bronchiseptica and Bordetella avium were
compared using a Blast, and significant hits were analyzed using RNAz. Twenty-three candidate regions were
obtained, including regions encoding the already documented 6S RNA, and the GCVT and FMN riboswitches. The
existence of sRNAs was verified by Northern blot analyses, and transcripts were detected for 13 out of the 20
additional candidates. These new sRNAs were named Bordetella pertussis RNAs, bpr. The expression of 4 of them
differed between the early, exponential and late growth phases, and one of them, bprJ2, was found to be under
the control of BvgA/BvgS two-component regulatory system of Bordetella virulence. A phylogenetic study of the
bprJ sequence revealed a novel, so far undocumented repeat of ~90 bp, found in numerous copies in the
Bordetella genomes and in that of other Betaproteobacteria. This repeat exhibits certain features of mobile
elements.
Conclusion: We shown here that B. pertussis, like other pathogens, expresses sRNAs, and that the expression of
one of them is controlled by the BvgA/BvgS system, similarly to most virulence genes, suggesting that it is
involved in virulence of B. pertussis.

Background
Small bacterial RNAs (sRNAs) have recently been shown
to participate in the regulation of gene expression, and
have been identified in numerous prokaryotic species
[1-4]. They act mainly by antisense base pairing with
their target mRNAs, often within a complex comprising
the Sm-like RNA chaperone Hfq [5-7] or by direct binding to proteins resulting in the modulation of their activity [8,9]. Some sRNAs are involved in the regulation of
virulence in several pathogenic bacteria [10-16]. These
sRNAs function either directly on virulence genes or on
their regulators. They act in parallel with protein regulatory systems in order to fine-tune the expression of

virulence genes. For example, the Staphylococcus aureus
RNAIII regulatory RNA is the effector molecule of
the quorum sensing system arg, composed of a twocomponent system (ArgA/C) sensing a small autoinducing peptide, which binds and activates ArgC. This autoinducing peptide is processed from the propeptide
(ArgD) by the peptidase (ArgB) [17].
In this work we focused on the pathogenic bacterium
Bordetella pertussis, the causative agent of whooping
cough, which remains an important global health problem,
with up to 300,000 annual deaths and approximately 45
million cases each year [18,19]. Most deaths occur in
young, unvaccinated children, but the incidence is also
increasing in vaccinated populations, with regular epidemic outbreaks since the 1990 s [20-22]. Several causes
have been attributed to this resurgence, including
increased awareness and improved diagnostics of the

disease, waning of vaccine-induced immunity and pathogen adaptation [19,22].
A large proportion of Bordetella genes undergo a
change in their expression during the infectious cycle
[23-25] some of which correspond to phenotypic modulation under the control of a two-component system
named BvgA/BvgS (reviewed in [26]). In this system BvgS
acts as a sensor anchored in the inner membrane and
BvgA as the transcriptional activator [27,28]. So far, little
is known about sRNAs in Bordetella and their potential
role in virulence or adaptation. Only three Bordetella
sRNAs have been identified, the 6S RNA [29], the
tmRNA [30] and a sRNA discovered by serendipity and
lying in the opposite direction of the bvgA/S mRNA 5’
untranslated region (UTR) [31,32]. The aim of this study
was to scan the B. pertussis genome in order to identify
potential sRNAs and to investigate whether some of
them might be related to bacterial virulence. We used a
general bioinformatics approach [33] and predicted 20
locations putatively bearing sRNA genes in intergenic
regions (IGR) of the B. pertussis genome. Transcription
was confirmed by Northern blot analyses for 13 of these
locations. We further studied the expression of these new
sRNAs under phenotypic modulation and showed that
one of them is under the control of the BvgA/BvgS system, suggesting its role in virulence.

Methods
Bacterial strains and growth conditions

The genome sequences of B. pertussis TohamaI, Bordetella
parapertussis 12822, Bordetella bronchesipteca RB50 [34]
and Bordetella avium N197 [35] were used in the computational analyses.
B. pertussis BPSM, a streptomycin-resistant derivative of
TohamaI [36], and BPLOW, an avirulent bvgAS deletion
mutant [37], were grown as previously described [24]
at 37°C in modified Stainer-Scholte medium, containing
100 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma Chemicals). Cultures were
stopped either at early (OD 600 nm ~ 0.9), exponential
(OD600 nm ~ 1.8) or stationary phase (OD600 nm ~ 3.8) by
adding 2 ml of 5:95 (v:v) phenol/ethanol to 8 ml of culture
medium. After centrifugation for 8 min. at 2800 × g the
pellets were stored at -80°C until further use.
For phenotypic modulation a 630-ml culture was grown
in the same conditions until an OD600 nm of approximately
0.7. The culture was then split into three, and phenotypic
modulation was induced by adding 40 ml of a pre-warmed
125 mM nicotinic acid (20 mM final concentration) or
40 ml of pre-warmed 300 mM MgSO4 (48 mM final concentration) in the two first sub-cultures. The third subculture served as control and received 40 ml of sterile
water pre-warmed at 37°C. Culturing was then continued
at 37°C, and samples were taken for RNA extraction, just

before induction (t = 0) and at t = 1 min., 10 min., 1 h,
2 h, 6 h, 10 h and 30 h post-induction.
In silico search of sRNAs

The bacterial genome sequences and annotation files
were obtained from the NCBI databases [38] and from
the Sanger Institute [39]. Gene coordinates were used to
extract IGRs using a parser in Perl. Homologous regions
of these IGR sequences were searched in different bacterial genomes using local BLAST. Hits presenting more
than 60% sequence identity over at least 70 nucleotides
were analyzed further. A multiple alignment of these
homologous regions was then obtained using ClustalW.
These alignments were used to evaluate secondary
structure conservation and thermodynamic stability
using the software “RNAz” developed by Washietl et al.
[33,40].
RNA extraction and Northern blot analyses

The bacterial pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of
1 mg/ml Lysozyme (Sigma Aldrisch). Total RNA was
then extracted using the TRI Reagent kit (Ambion), following the recommendations of the supplier. The RNA
quality was checked using Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies) before denaturation and electrophoresis (10 μg
per lane) on a 10% acrylamide:bis-acrylamide (37.5:1)
denaturing gel in 0.5 × TBE buffer in the presence of 8 M
urea. The RNA was then transferred onto BrightStar Plus
(Ambion) nylon membranes and UV-crosslinked. Biotinylated oligonucleotides (see Additional file 1, table S1),
designed using FastPCR [41], were then used for hybridization in Northern Max buffer (Ambion), and the blots
were developed by chemiluminescent detection using the
BrightStar Biodetect kit (Ambion).
Local DNA alignment

Homology searches were performed with the program
YASS [42] in local using the default parameters.
For the similarity search of the bprJ1 sequence, the program YASS was used on the web server [43] using the
default parameters, except for the ‘Hit criterion strategy’,
which was set on ‘double hit’. The sequence of the IGR
containing bprJ1 (between positions 3605200 and 3605405)
was searched for homology in the B. pertussis genome. The
homologous regions were then aligned using ClustalW,
and the sequence closest to the consensus sequence (i.e.
the sequence from position 2208359 to 2208448) was used
as a query for the search in all bacterial genome sequences.
For the global sequence similarity search, the B. pertussis IGR sequences longer than 140 nucleotides and
not containing tRNA or rRNA genes were compared
using YASS with all complete bacterial genome
sequences available in GenBank, except those of the

Bordetella genus. Hits with a score >50 and with >70%
identity were considered further.

Results and discussion
In silico prediction of sRNAs and validation by Northern
blot analysis

Except for the 6S RNA [29], the tmRNA [30] and a small
RNA transcribed in antisense to the bvgA mRNA [31,32],
no sRNA has been identified so far in Bordetella. We used
the ‘RNAz’ algorithm [33], which is based on a search for
structure conservation between closely related bacterial
genomes. Predictions using different combinations of betaproteobacteria genomes resulted in various numbers of
candidates. We choose to work on a prediction obtained
comparing genomes of B. pertussis Tohama I, B. bronchiseprica RB50, B. parapertussis 12822 and B. avium 197N.
This search resulted in the prediction of 23 sequences for
potential sRNAs in the B. pertussis genome (see Additional
file 1, table S2 for the detailed list of predictions). The
same search strategy using only B. pertussis Tohama I,
B. bronchiseprica RB50 and B. parapertussis 12822
resulted in 657 predictions. Among the 23 predicted
sequences, the position of the 6S RNA gene was correctly
designated (predicted coordinates from 3246822 to
3246972, real coordinates from 3246812 to 3246993), as
well as the position of 2 riboswitches already described in
the Rfam database [44]. The first, GCVT, is selectively
triggered by glycine [45] and controls the translation of
the aminomethyltransferase mRNA (BP0195). The second
riboswitch belongs to the flavin mononucleotide (FMN)
class [46] and regulates the translation of ribB (BP0471).
Validation by Northern blot analysis

All 23 predicted regions, except the ones of the GCVT
riboswitch, the FMN riboswitch and the 6S RNA, were
tested for transcription of small-size RNA by Northern
blot analyses. Biotinylated oligonucleotide probes were
designed for both strands of the 20 predicted regions (see
probe sequences in Additional file 1, table S1) and used to
test the presence and orientation of short transcripts in
Northern blot analyses. As a positive control, an additional
probe was designed that corresponds to the sRNA characterized by Scarlato et al. [31,32]. When total RNA
extracted from B. pertussis cultures stopped at an ODs600
nm of 0.9, 1.8 or 3.6 was analyzed, 13 positions in addition
to the positive control showed evidence of transcription
(see Additional file 1, figure S1). The transcription profile
of these 14 genomic regions was further analyzed for the
kinetics of expression over 30 h of culture [from OD600 nm
~0.7 to ~7.9] (Figure 1). All the bands clearly detected in
the Northern blots in the validation experiments (Figure 1
and Additional file 1, figure S1) and in the phenotypic

Page 3 of 13

modulation experiments (see below) were considered as
transcripts. Each detected transcript was labeled with a
capital letter. A number was added after the letter to discriminate transcripts in case of multiple bands (e.g. TranscriptA1, TranscriptA2). Locations for which transcription
was detected on both strands were distinguished with an
apostrophe, e.g. TranscriptM, TranscriptM’ (Figure 1 and
Table 1).
The analysis of five genomic positions resulted in the
detection of 2 bands (transcripts A1 and A2, D1 and
D3, E1 and E2, L1 and L2, N1 and N2), indicating the
presence of two overlapping transcripts of different
lengths, as has been seen for several sRNAs of Pseudomonas aeroginosa[47] and for Escherichia coli IstR1 and
IstR2, which have each a specific function and are generated from separate promoters but share a common 5’
end [48]. Alternatively, these bands could be the result
of a post-transcriptional processing of a single RNA
transcript [47].
Some transcripts were only produced during the exponential phase (transcripts A1, A2 and F). Transcript D1
was expressed at higher levels during exponential phase
compared to the early and stationary phases, whereas
Transcript D2 did not show any significant modification
of expression during growth. This observation rules out
the possibility that Transcript D1 is the precursor of
Transcript D2, and argues that the two transcripts are
independent and under the control of different factors.
In contrast, Transcripts A1, A2 and Transcripts F1, F2,
are expressed at similar levels during the different
growth phases. They may therefore each be produced
from a unique RNA and subsequently processed into a
shorter version. Finally, two regions gave rise to a transcript from both strands. Transcripts L1 and L’ are transcribed respectively from the lagging and leading strand
template of predicted region 3811548-3811699. Transcripts M and M’ are transcribed respectively from the
lagging and leading strand template of predicted region
3896371-3896457. In both cases, the two transcripts had
the same apparent size (~80 nucleotides for transcripts
L1 and L’ and ~190 nucleotides for transcripts M and
M’). For these two pairs of transcripts, the biotinylated
probes used to detect transcription on both strands
were designed approximately at the same coordinates,
indicating that the observed transcripts are complimentary to each other for most of their lengths (Figures 1
and 2B).
Most regulatory sRNAs are synthesized as discrete
transcripts under the control of dedicated promoter and
terminator sequences. However, some bacterial regulatory elements correspond to sequences at the 5’ or 3’
UTRs of mRNAs that can adopt different conformations

in response to environmental signals. This is the case
for autoregulatory motifs and riboswitches [49]. Some of
these regulatory elements can, under specific conditions,
cause transcriptional arrest (reviewed in [50]). In order
to test whether some of the transcripts detected in this
study are abortive, processed or degraded forms of the
5’UTR or 3’UTR of their neighboring genes, a control
RT-PCR was carried out on transcripts which were in
close vicinity of and in the same orientation as their
neighboring 5’ or 3’ ORF (see Additional file 2, figure S2
and table S3). All detected transcripts were found to
result from independent transcription, except for Transcript B, which was linked to the transcription of the
downstream gene rpsB (BP1419), encoding the 30S ribosomal protein S2. The function of S2 is still uncertain. It
may potentially act as a bridge between the 16S RNA
and ribosomal protein S1 [51]. The ORF of rpsB genes
have recently been shown to be preceded by a conserved
specific motif in the 5’UTR, which could be a cis-

regulatory element binding to the S2 protein for an
autoregulatory control of its own synthesis [52]. The
existence of Transcript B suggests that in B. pertussis
the 5’UTR of rpsB contains a cis-regulatory element
inhibiting the full-length transcription of the mRNA, as
it has been demonstrated for other ribosomal protein
genes [53,54].
Finally, the coding potential of all transcripts was
evaluated by a search for potential coding sequences in
their genomic regions using the program ‘ORF Finder’
of the NCBI [55] (data not shown). As the B. pertussis
genome appears to be under-annotated when the EasyGene prediction is compared to the RefSeq annotation
[56], we also looked for predicted coding sequences or
neighboring genes with alternative start codons in
these genomic regions, using the prokaryotic gene-finder algorithm EasyGene. No coding sequences were
predicted in the transcribed regions, even for the longest ones.

are located in IGR of various lengths, comprised
between 206 bp and 783 bp. They have no apparent
preference for lagging or leading strand templates, but
they are preferentially located on one of the two replichores (79%) (See Figure 2A). These characteristics are
similar to those of the E. coli sRNA genes [57].
Some of the B. pertussis sRNA genes (BprC, I and N)
are very close to or overlap adjacent ORFs in the opposite orientation and thus are likely to act on their
mRNA, whereas others are more distant from the adjacent ORFs and/or in the same orientation (See Figure
2B). The potential mRNA targets of all sRNAs were predicted using TargetRNA algorithm [58]. The predicted
gene targets were compared to documented targets of
sRNAs from other bacteria. However, none of the

(see Additional file 1, table S2) and the apparent lengths of the
transcripts on the Northern blots. In case of multi-band detection
only the longest transcript is represented.

Nicotinic acid induction
In view of these observations we conclude that all
detected transcripts are genuine sRNAs and were therefore named Bordetella pertussis RNAs (BprA1, A2, B, C,
...). The rpsB gene probably contains in its 5’UTR an
autoregulatory element, and BprB most likely results
from the inhibition of transcription of the rpsB mRNA.
The validated sRNA genes are scattered throughout the
B. pertussis chromosome (Figure 2A). The location of
these sRNA genes relatively to their neighboring genes
was determined by the biotinylated probe coordinates
and the apparent sizes on the Northern blots (Figure 2B).
Features of the B. pertussis sRNAs

Specific and general features of the B. pertussis sRNAs
were further analyzed and compared with those of other
bacterial sRNAs. The genes of the B. pertussis sRNAs

predicted B. pertussis mRNA targets was orthologous to
a sRNA target from another bacterium (data not
shown). Similarly, orthologous genes of the B. pertussis
sRNA-flanking genes were searched in the Rfam and
Noncode databases, as some sRNAs are cis-encoded
antisense or cis-acting elements. The only product mentioned in these databases is the ribonuclease E gene
(ortholog to BP0475), which flanks bprA and is in the
same orientation. BprA might therefore be the 5’UTR
cis-acting element of the ribonuclease E gene (rne
5’UTR), which codes for a key enzyme in the mRNA
degradation pathway, including its own. This rne 5’UTR
element acts as a sensor of the cellular RNase E concentration and allows for auto-regulation of its mRNA
degradation [59].
Phenotypic modulation of B. pertussis sRNAs

may potentially be under the control of the two-component system BvgA/S and therefore potentially be

involved in Bordetella virulence regulation, phenotypic
modulation was induced by adding nicotinic acid or
MgSO 4 in the growth medium in order to switch the
bacteria from the virulent (Bvg+ phase) to the non-virulent phase (Bvg - phase) [60,61]. The modulation of
expression was monitored by Northern blot analyses for
up to 30 h after induction (data not shown) and the
expression profiles were compared to those of the noninduced culture. One sRNA, BprJ, showed a change in
its expression compared to the control culture. The 80nucleotides band detected in the non-modulated culture
did not change after phenotypic modulation, but a second band of approximately 200 nucleotides appeared 6
h and 10 h after induction of phenotypic modulation by
MgSO4 and nicotinic acid, respectively (Figure 3). This
new band is indicative of longer transcript overlapping
the 80-nucleotide transcript and appears to be specific
for the non-virulent phase (Bvg- phase). According to
the nomenclature adopted above, this second transcript
was named BprJ2 to distinguish it from the 80-nucleotides transcript, which was named BprJ1.
To confirm that this new transcript is under the control of the BvgA/BvgS system, its expression was monitored by Northern blot analysis in the avirulent BPLOW
mutant in which part of the bvgA-bvgS operon had been
deleted [37]. BprJ2 was also detected in the BPLOW
RNA (Figure 4), confirming its vrg (virulence repressed
gene) feature. The other vrgs of B. pertussis mainly
encode cell-envelope, small-molecule degradation or
hypothetical proteins [23,24] and include the previously

vrg73 genes [62].
Identification of a novel Betaproteobacteria repeated
element

A local DNA sequence analysis using YASS showed that
the bprJ1 and bprJ2 genomic region contains a
sequence, from coordinates 3605317 to 3605401, highly
repeated in the Bordetella (see Additional file 1, list S1)
and in several other Beta-proteobacteria genomes (Table
2). We named it therefore Beta-proteobacterial repeat
element (BRE). This repeated element is found as a fulllength sequence of ~90 bp or as partial but conserved
sequence (between ~60 and ~40 bp) with a maximum
number of 29 repeats (with scores > 50 and > 70% identity) in the genome of Polaromonas sp. JS666 (see Additional file 1, table S4). All identified repeated elements
were located in chromosomal DNA, usually in IGRs,
although some overlap ORFs at their 5’ or 3’ ends by a
few bases. Surprisingly, some of the repeats are located
entirely within coding sequences.
Some IGRs and ORFs contain more than one BRE (a
maximum of 8 repeats was observed in B. bronchiseptica
between BB2301 (sphB3) and BB3202) organized in tandem with no or only a few nucleotides between each
repeat. The complete and partial BRE sequences are
scattered around the chromosomes of B. pertussis, B.
bronchiseptica, B. parapertussis and B. avium (Figure 5).
An analysis of the Bordetella BRE sequences revealed 44
full-length repeats, ranging from 75 to 91 bp in length,
and 1 partial repeat of 50 bp. They exhibit an average
GC-content of 69.0% (ranging from 63.7% to 78.9%),
which is higher than the average GC-content of IGR
sequences (62.9% for IGRs ≥ 10 bp) and slightly higher
than the average GC-content of the complete genome
sequences (67.7%). The orientations of the repeats,
inferred by the transcriptional orientation of bprJ1 and
bprJ2, are not co-orientated with the direction of the
replication fork.
The genetic context, i.e. the nature and orientation of
the BRE flanking genes, is only moderately conserved
between B. pertussis, B. bronchiseptica and B. parapertussis (see table 3). For instance, only 4 (#1, 3, 4 and 6)
out of the 9 loci from B. pertussis, B. bronchiseptica or
B. parapertussis show conservation of the genetic context in the 3 genomes (table 3). None of the genetic
contexts is conserved in the B. avium genome (loci #10
to 13).
For some loci the numbers of tandem repeats vary
between the different genomes. For example, locus #3
contains 2 repeats in B. pertussis (between BP1793
and BP1794, lexA), 4 in B. parapertussis (between

Page 8 of 13

BPP2022 and BPP2023, lexA) and 3 in B. bronchiseptica (between BB2270 and BB2271, lexA) (table 3, Figure 5). Locus #2 is conserved only in B. pertussis and
B. bronchiseptica. It has 2 repeats in B. pertussis
(between BP1110, sphB3, and BP1111) and 8 in B.
bronchiseptica (between BB2301, sphB3, and BB2302).
Two out of 8 loci in B. bronchiseptica (loci #7 and 8)
have no homologous locus in the other genomes, and
1 out of 5 loci in the B. parapertussis genome (locus
9) has no homologous locus in the other genomes. A
multiple alignment analysis on the Bordetella repeats
shows a high level of conservation within the genus,
as well as more widely within the all Betaproteobacteria class (Figure 6).
Several small repeats have been documented over the
years in other prokaryotic species, including ERICs in
enterobacteria [63-65], NEMIS in Neisseria spp.
[66-68], the BOX and RUP elements in Streptococcus
pneumoniae[69-71], MIRUs in Mycobacterium tuberculosis[72] and the bcr1 element of Bacillus cereus
[73,74]. These repeats often feature characteristics of
mobile elements and have a role in mRNA stabilization, transcription termination or promoter activity.
BRE, described for the first time in this study, needs
further investigation before we can suggest any potential function. Its heterogeneous chromosomal distribution and the fact that it is sometimes found in
multiple copies at a same locus might imply a mobility
or a past-mobility property. A preliminary search for
BRE in sequences of other strains of B. pertussis,
B. bronchiseptica and B. parapertussis revealed the presence of variable numbers of the repeat at the same
locus among different strains (data not shown). This
qualifies BREs as Variable Number Tandem Repeats
(VNTR). This feature was verified using a VNTR analysis program [75], and most of identified loci were
correctly predicted as VNTR, except for locus 3 in B.
pertussis and B. bronchiseptica, and for locus 4 in B.
bronchiseptica (data not shown). Additional investigations are under progress to assess BRE as potential
genotyping markers.

Conclusion
B. pertussis and B. parapertussis, the second agent of
whooping cough-like disease, have evolved relatively
recently from a B. bronchiseptica-like ancestor, but
these species have remained clonal, with a very limited
number of B. pertussis-specific genes [76,77]. It is established that B. pertussis evolution and adaptation to
humans occurred mainly through gene loss and recombination of the chromosome rather than through acquisition of new genes that would promote human

infection [34]. It has also been suggested that certain
genes are expressed differently in B. pertussis and in
B. bronchiseptica, and that this difference might be
responsible in part for infection in humans [78]. Such
differences in expression may rely on classical base substitutions or indels in promoter regions of these genes
but perhaps also on the specific action of unidentified
regulatory molecules, such as sRNAs. In this study we

have shown that B. pertussis, like other pathogens,
expresses sRNAs and that the expression of one of
them, BprJ2, is under the control of the BvgA/BvgS system. This sRNA and others, identified in this study or
yet to be identified, could be important regulators for
B. pertussis virulence acting either under the control of
BvgA/BvgS as co-regulators or as independent virulence
regulators.
