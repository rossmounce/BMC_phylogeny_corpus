Comparative genomics of Escherichia coli isolated
from patients with inflammatory bowel disease

Abstract
Background: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is used to describe a state of idiopathic, chronic inflammation of
the gastrointestinal tract. The two main phenotypes of IBD are Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). The
major cause of IBD-associated mortality is colorectal cancer. Although both host-genetic and exogenous factors
have been found to be involved, the aetiology of IBD is still not well understood. In this study we characterized
thirteen Escherichia coli strains from patients with IBD by comparative genomic hybridization employing a
microarray based on 31 sequenced E. coli genomes from a wide range of commensal and pathogenic isolates.
Results: The IBD isolates, obtained from patients with UC and CD, displayed remarkably heterogeneous genomic
profiles with little or no evidence of group-specific determinants. No IBD-specific genes were evident when
compared with the prototypic CD isolate, LF82, suggesting that the IBD-inducing effect of the strains is
multifactorial. Several of the IBD isolates carried a number of extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC)-related
virulence determinants such as the pap, sfa, cdt and hly genes. The isolates were also found to carry genes of
ExPEC-associated genomic islands.
Conclusions: Combined, these data suggest that E. coli isolates obtained from UC and CD patients represents a
heterogeneous population of strains, with genomic profiles that are indistinguishable to those of ExPEC isolates.
Our findings indicate that IBD-induction from E. coli strains is multifactorial and that a range of gene products may
be involved in triggering the disease.

Background
The term inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is used to
describe a state of idiopathic, chronic inflammation of
the gastrointestinal tract. The two main phenotypes of
IBD are Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis
(UC). CD is characterized by granulomatous inflammation and may affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract
but is particularly prevalent in the ileocaecal area. UC,
on the other hand, which is associated with extensive
epithelial damage, crypt abscesses and significant neutrophil infiltration, is colon-specific. Patients suffering
from extensive ulcerative colitis or colonic CD have a
10-fold increased risk of developing colorectal cancer,
the major cause of IBD-associated mortality. The prevalence of IBD is 1-20 cases per 100,000 individuals and

up to two million people are estimated to be affected by
IBD worldwide [1,2]. IBD is more prevalent in developed countries than in developing countries, which has
given rise to a number of theories regarding the significance of dietary preferences for the development and
exacerbation of IBD [3-5].
Although the aetiology of IBD is still not well understood, it is generally believed that both host, environmental and microbial factors are involved. Several
host-genetic factors (e.g. NOD2/CARD15) and exogenous factors (e.g. diet and smoking) have been identified
[6]. Growing evidence also indicates that IBD results
from an inappropriate immune response to the intestinal flora in genetically susceptible individuals. Animal
models have shown that colitis does not occur in
germ-free environment, but can be induced by the
addition of bacteria [7,8]. The large intestine and colon
are heavily colonized by microorganisms. While the
bacteria associated with the intestinal flora are usually

associated with a commensal lifestyle and form symbiotic multi-species communities, these bacteria may
in some cases cause disease. There is mounting evidence that the composition of the microbiota in
patients suffering from IBD is abnormal, and that the
biodiversity is lower than in healthy subjects [9]. A
range of bacterial species have been implicated in IBD,
including Escherichia coli. Several studies have
reported increased levels of E. coli in IBD tissues
[10-12]. IBD patients have also been found to display
increased serum immune-reactivity against E. coli as
compared to healthy control subjects [13]. The identification of specific E. coli isolates with adherent and
invasive capabilities in relation to CD patients has led
to the coining of a new E. coli pathotype, the adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC) [14]. The complete genome
sequences of the prototypic CD E. coli isolate, LF82, as
well as one other CD isolate, NRG857c, were recently
published [15,16] and may pave the way for an
increased understanding of the involvement of AIEC in
IBD. Interestingly, studies with various probiotic
microorganisms, including E. coli Nissle 1917, have
shown that some probiotics may have a positive effect
on inflammatory bowel disease [17-19]. This effect
might be due to bacterial competition [20].
We have previously described the design and application of a 31-genome CGH microarray of E. coli [21,22].
In this study we have used this array to examine the
genomic profile of a range of IBD isolates. We recently
characterized a set of E. coli strains isolated from IBD
patients [23]. Here we present a detailed comparative
genomics study of these strains. We show that IBD isolates represents a heterogeneous population of strains,
which display a remarkable resemblance with ExPEC
isolates. Given that most ExPEC isolates originate from
the intestinal tract, where they normally are present
only in low numbers, it is conceivable that in IBD
patients these clones are overrepresented.

Results
Genomic profiling of IBD-related E. coli isolates

The comparative genomic analysis included five ulcerative colitis (UC) isolates, eight Crohn’s disease (CD) isolates and the prototypic uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC)
strain CFT073 (Table 1). Based on the CGH data, we
initially sought to compare the IBD isolates with respect
to their overall genomic profile. Interestingly, the comparison did not reveal the presence of two distinct subpopulations, i.e. UC and CD; rather it grouped the
strains primarily according to their phylogenetic group
(Figure 1). The only exception to this pattern was UC
isolate p22, a group B2 isolate, which clustered most
closely with UC isolate p19B, a group D strain. Therefore, based on the overall genotype, the UC and CD

strains were indistinguishable. This clearly shows that
the single most important determinant for the genomic
profiles of IBD isolates is their phylogenetic group origin. With the exception of p22, this also suggests that
the presence of horizontally acquired genetic segments
does not generally obscure the phylogenetic signal.
Within each phylogenetic group, some clustering
according to disease was observed, although the relatively small number of isolates limits the delineation.
Combined, the data shows that bacterial isolates from
UC and CD display remarkably heterogeneous genomic
profiles.

IBD-specific markers

The implication of a specific E. coli pathovar (or pathovars) in the aetiology of IBD has remained elusive,
mostly due to the lack of definable IBD marker genes.
Recently, the complete genome sequences of two AIEC
strains, i.e. LF82, a prototypic CD strain, and CD strain
NRG857c, were published [15,16]. This may pave the
way for a more systematic search for genetic determinants which can help to classify these pathogens. In
order to look for commonalities between LF82 and the
IBD isolates used in this study, we compared the
inferred genomic sequence of our IBD strains with that
of LF82. Initially this led us to examine the prevalence
of LF82-associated genomic islands among the IBD isolates. Several of the genomic islands of LF82 appeared
to be quite conserved among the IBDs, whereas others
were less prevalent, or even LF82-specific (Figure 2).
None of the isolates were found to carry to the GILF82-pheU island (mainly hypothetical proteins of
unknown function) or the -1 prophage element, while
most of the isolates were predicted to carry the high
pathogenicity island (HPI), or PAI-II. The HPI island,
which encodes yersiniabactin, is particularly prevalent

among ExPEC isolates, and is known to contribute to
the persistence of CFT073 in the urinary tract (murine
model) [24]. The remaining islands were present in
some, but not in all IBD isolates, clearly illustrating the
heterogeneity of the population. Although each of these
islands may contribute to the pathogenesis or fitness of
LF82, most are clearly not descriptive of IBD isolates in
general.
The complete genome sequence of LF82 allowed
Miquel et al. to identify 115 LF82-specific genes by
comparison with other sequenced E. coli genomes.
However, the requirement or contribution of these
genes to the pathogenesis of LF82 remains unknown, as
does the general prevalence of these genes among IBD
isolates. Of the 115 genes, 22 are shared by the other
sequenced AIEC strain NRG857c. We analysed the
CGH data to examine the prevalence of these genes
among our IBD strains. Of the 115 LF82-specific genes,
57 were represented on the CGH microarray. Of these
only seven were found present in one or more IBD
strains examined, and none were present in all strains.
Among the 22 genes, which were shared by NRG857c,
only two genes were predicted present (and then only in

The ability to adhere to and colonize epithelial surfaces
is a critical step in the development of many bacterial
infections. Although the role of mucosa-associated E. coli
in the development or exacerbation of IBD remains controversial, the association of E. coli isolates with the mucosal surface is intimately linked with the disorder(s). In
order to determine the general adhesion and virulence
potential of the IBD isolates, the genomic profiles were
examined for a number of known and putative colonization and virulence factors. Several fimbrial operon genes
were found among the isolates, which could contribute to
adhesion of these strains (Table 2). Interestingly, the
majority of the isolates were predicted to carry P-fimbriarelated genes; also, two UC and five CD isolates showed
positive haemagglutination (Table 3). Other adhesionrelated genes identified among some of the isolates
included the sil genes (adhesin for cattle colonization),
shlA (autotransporter), a filamentous haemoagglutinin and
hek (adhesion determinant) (Additional file 1, Table S1).

a single isolate). This clearly reveals that these genes are
most likely strain-specific rather than IBD-specific
genes. Although some LF82-specific genes that were not
present on our microarray might be prevalent among
IBD isolates, our results suggest that it may be very difficult to identify IBD-specific genetic markers.

Same results were obtained by both CGH analysis and genome sequence

Present/ absent calls are based on the entire fimbrial operons. Some

The isolates were also found to carry a number of biofilmrelated genes such as the fim, flu and csg genes encoding
type 1 fimbriae, Ag43 (autotransporter protein) and curli,
respectively (Table 3). There is mounting evidence that
bacterial biofilms plays an important role in intestinal
colonization and there is a growing interest in the role of
biofilm formation in inflammatory bowel disease [25].
However, there was little if any indication that the IBD
isolates displayed any consistently better biofilm-forming
capacity in vitro in LB than isolates obtained from healthy
control individuals (Figure 3). Several of the isolates also
carried a number of genes related to invasion, including
ibeA, invA and tia (Additional file 1, Table S1).
Classical virulence genes

The IBD isolates did not carry any of the classical virulence determinants characteristic of intestinal pathogenic E. coli (Table 4). This correlates well with
previous studies, which have also found little evidence
of the involvement of specific types of intestinal E. coli
pathotypes in the etiology of IBD [26]. However, several
of the UC strains were found to carry the hly genes and
displayed haemolytic activity (Table 3).

Other virulence and fitness factors

In order to look for other potential genetic markers of
IBD, we compared the inferred genomic profiles of the
isolates with a range of sequenced commensal strains
belonging to different phylogenetic groups. Initially we
looked for genes that were present in all the IBD isolates but absent in the six commensal strains selected
for the analysis (i.e. MG1655 (A), HS (A), IAI1 (B1),
SE11 (B1), ED1a (B2) and SE15 (B2)). We also looked
for genes common to all isolates within each disease
category. No probes could specifically differentiate the
UC and the CD isolates from the commensal strains.
The UC isolates shared only one gene that was not present among the six commensal strains (i.e.
ECIAI39_1981, encoding a hypothetical protein of bacteriophage origin). In CFT073, this gene is located in

PAI-CFT073-icdA. Even within each phylogenetic group,
only a few genes were conserved. Among the group A
strains, only three genes were identified that were not
present among the commensal group A strains, including two hypothetical proteins and a putative TonB-like
protein. Among group B2, only the ECIAI39_1981 gene
was identified. This clearly shows that the IBD isolates
represent a heterogeneous population.
Given the heterogeneous nature of the genomic profiles, we proceeded to compare each individual isolate
with the commensal strains (Additional file 1, Table
S1). Except for the adhesin- and toxin-encoding genes
already mentioned, several of the isolates were also
predicted to carry lateral flagella. Interestingly, p22
was also found to carry the genes for lateral flagella, a
trait which appears to be particular prevalent among

group D strains. This may give some indication as to
why this strain grouped with the D strains rather than
the B2 strains (Figure 1). Several of the isolates were
found to carry genes relating to propandiol utilization;
however, none of the isolates were predicted to carry
all of the pdu operon genes. Interestingly, several of

the IBD isolates carried the gipA gene, a Peyer’s
patch-specific virulence factor, which is also present in
LF82. A few isolates also carried vapA, coding for a
putative virulence associated protein, as well as a
range of ExPEC-related virulence genes (see subsequent section).

UC- and CD-specific genes

The manifestations of UC and CD are distinctly different, as are the pro-inflammatory mediators seen in the
two IBD phenotypes. We therefore decided to compare
the genomic profiles of the two groups to see whether
the E. coli isolates associated with UC and CD would
display divergent genotypes. Overall, there were no
genes that could entirely differentiate one group from
the other, although a few probes were more associated
with one group than the other (Additional file 2, Table
S2). This clearly highlights the heterogeneity of the
populations. It should be noted that isolates were not all
obtained from the same origin, which could affect the
analysis.
Similarity to UTI isolates

Previous studies have shown that many IBD isolates carry
a range of ExPEC-associated virulence determinants.
Therefore, the IBD genomic profiles were compared with
the CGH data obtained for a range of clinical ExPEC isolates (in this case UTI and urosepsis isolates). Based on
their overall genomic profiles, there was no clear delineation between the various disease groups. The phylogenetic
analysis grouped the isolates mainly according to their
phylogenetic group, and little if any grouping of the IBD
isolates was observed (Figure 4). We subsequently examined the prevalence of a range of CFT073-associated
islands among the IBD isolates. CFT073 carries a number
of well-characterized genomic islands [24], which are all
represented on the CGH microarray. Interestingly, several
of the IBD isolates were predicted to carry a number of
these islands, some of which are not present in the
sequenced commensal isolates, such as the CFT073
islands located at aspV, serX, serU, asnW (pks), cobU,
metV and leuX (Figure 5). The pks island, encoding the
machinery for the synthesis of colibactin (capable of inducing breaks in double-stranded DNA in eukaryotic cells),
was present in three of five UC isolates, while only two of
eight CD isolates carried this island. A few of the UC isolates were predicted to carry PAI-CFT073-serU, which
have previously been shown to encode an immuno-modulatory protein TcpC, which is important for upper urinary
tract infections [27,28]. Several of the IBD isolates also carried PAI-CFT073-pheV and PAI-CFT073-pheU, which
encode P fimbriae and haemolysin; some strains were also
found to express the phenotypes associated with these factors (Table 3). A few CD isolates carried GI-CFT073-selC.
In accordance with the presence of a range of UPEC-associated islands, the IBD isolates were also predicted to carry
and express a number of ExPEC virulence/fitness genes
(Tables 2, 3 and 5). The presence of a number of CFT073associated PAIs and expression of ExPEC virulence genes
among the IBD strains clearly reveals that the IBD strains
strongly resemble ExPEC strains.

Discussion
The data presented here shows that E. coli IBD isolates
represent a heterogeneous population, and that the single most important determinant for the genomic profile
of the isolates is their phylogenetic group origin. The
data also suggests that it may be difficult to identify
IBD-specific, or even CD- or UC-specific, genetic markers. This correlates well with previous reports of
Crohn’s disease and colon cancer isolates, which also
showed that these isolates by no means represent uniform populations [29]. The results may also explain why
the pursuit for IBD-specific genetic determinants among
E. coli isolates essentially has remained fruitless. However, although no IBD-specific markers could be identified in this study (taking into account 57 of the 115
LF82-specific genes previously identified), it cannot be
excluded that the LF82-specific genes that were not
represented on the chip, or other E. coli genes missing

on the chip, could be IBD-specific. As with many pathogens, virulence is often multifactorial and made up by
an assortment of diverse virulence factors. The LF82specific genes may therefore still prove to be important
for the IBD-inducing capacity of that particular strain.
Nevertheless, it indicates that it may be difficult if not
impossible to find unique IBD genes. Our findings indicate that IBD-induction from E. coli strains is multifactorial and that a range of gene products can trigger the
disease. The apparent lack of IBD- and group-specific
genetic determinants among the isolates also suggests
that the host-microbe interactions and the altered environment of the gut likely play the most important roles
in the aetiology of IBD. Due to the predisposition of the
patient, the bacterial colonization may invoke an autoimmune reaction, which escalates, leading to the clinical
symptoms of IBD.
The prevalence of various adhesive structures among
the isolates varied considerably. Only relatively few fimbriae-encoding genes were shared by all isolates, even
within each disease category. Type I fimbriae has previously been shown to be important for the invasive and
adhesive characteristic of the prototypic AIEC strain
LF82 [30]. It targets the carcinoembryonic antigenrelated cell adhesion molecule 6 (CEACAM6) that is
expressed on the apical side of ileal epithelial cells [31].
The high level of ileal colonization that is observed in
CD patients may be linked to an abnormal expression of
CEACAM6, indicating the presence of predisposing

Page 8 of 12

factors [31]. Interestingly, while most of the IBD isolates
examined in this study were found to carry the fim
genes, far from all were able to agglutinate yeast. It
therefore seems likely that some of the isolates achieve
adherence be means of other surface structures. Interestingly, several strains were found to carry and express
P-fimbriae. While usually associated with UTI strains, P
fimbriae can promote intestinal colonization [32,33].
However, whether P fimbriae or any of the other adhesive structures carried by these IBD isolates contributes
to adherence in the IBD-inflicted gut, remains to be
determined.
In recent years, there has been a growing appreciation
of the importance of biofilm formation in the development and exacerbation of a range of chronic infections.
This prompted us to evaluate the biofilm formation
capacity of our IBD isolates. Previous studies have suggested that AIEC strains may be more efficient biofilm
producers than non-AIEC isolates [25]. However, in this
study there was no indication that the IBD strains displayed superior biofilm capacities to the non-IBD control strains. There was also no correlation between the
active or inactive state of the diseases, and the biofilm
production displayed by the isolates. Experimental differences and strains variations (incl. demographic origin)
may explain such discrepancy. We have also not focused
specifically on AIEC strains, unlike the previous study.
Most of the IBD isolates studied here were found to
carry, and express, a number of genetic markers that are
associated with ExPEC isolates. ExPEC, which predominantly belong to the phylogenetic groups B2 and D, are
generally believed to originate from the gut, where they
represent a small fraction of the E. coli flora. It might be
conceivable that ExPEC-like strains are overrepresented
in the microbiota of IBD patients, possibly due to the
altered gut environment caused by the underlying
genetic and environmental factors. This correlates well
with the finding that the levels of strains belonging to
group B2 are increased in IBD patients as compared
with control subjects [23]. E. coli strains belonging to
group B2, and to some extent group D, are known to
carry a number of virulence and fitness genes that are
not present in strains belonging to groups A and B1.
ExPEC strains are associated with a number of extraintestinal infections like urinary tract infections, meningitis, pneumonia and wound infections. ExPEC strains are
also usually regarded as being incapable of intestinal
infections [34,35]. Meanwhile, they are good long-term
colonisers of the human gut and about 20% of E. coli
gut isolates are ExPEC strains. Paradoxically, IBD-associated strains seem to be the only ExPEC-type strains
that are associated with intestinal infections (such as CD
and UC). Our data suggests that these strains are not
genetically distinct from other ExPEC strains.

Conclusions
Collectively, our findings indicate that IBD-associated
E.coli represent a heterogeneous population of strains,
whose genomic profiles greatly resembles that of
ExPEC isolates. Arguably, our findings indicate that
IBD-induction from E. coli is multifactorial and that
different combinations of gene products may trigger
the disease in a complex interplay with host parameters and environmental cues. Nevertheless, it still
remains to be determined whether IBD-associated E.
coli are directly involved in the pathogenesis of IBD or
whether their presence is simply a result of the inflammatory response and the altered microbial environment of the IBD gut.
Methods
Bacterial strains and growth media

The strains used in this study are described in Table 1.
HM95, HM154, HM413, HM419, HM580, HM605 and
HM615 were kindly provided by Barry J. Campbell [36].

Two well-characterized E.coli strains, Nissle 1917 and
MG1655, were included as controls in the phenotypic
experiments [37,38]. All cultivations were performed in
modified LB medium [39] or ABTG with 0.02% casamino acids. All strains were grown in modified LB medium prior to genomic DNA isolation.
Microarray design and sample preparation

The detailed design of the CGH custom microarray has
been described elsewhere [21]. The 31 E. coli genomes
used for designing the microarray included the prototypic CD strain LF82 and several ExPEC isolates, such as
uropathogenic and avian pathogenic E. coli strains, as
well as other pathogenic E. coli strains (e.g. EHEC) and
a number of K-12 isolates. The microarray consisted of
134,285 probe sets (of 50-75mers) representing 16,098
E. coli target genes. The genomic DNA was isolated
using the “IllustraTM bacterial genomicPrep Spin Kit”
(GE Healthcare, 28-9042-58), and the samples were
diluted to the recommended concentration. Sample

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/316

preparation was then carried out using the NimbleGen
Arrays User’s Guide for CGH analysis. All isolates,
except the reference strain CFT073, were run as single
samples. The supporting microarray data have been
deposited in ArrayExpress (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/
arrayexpress) with the accession numbers E-MEXP3090, E-MEXP-3089 and E-MTAB-212.
CGH data analysis

Data analysis was performed in R (statistical software),
using the ‘oligo’ package for analysis of oligonucleotide
arrays at the probe-level (Bioconductor) [40]. The RMA
algorithm was used to perform background subtraction,
normalisation and expression calculation (output in the
log2 scale). Blast atlases were created using the GeneWiz whole genome visualization tool [41]. Hierarchical
agglomerative clustering was performed in R, using the
‘hclust’ clustering method, an euclidean distance measure and the complete genomic profile of each strain
(log values for all genes represented by more four or
more probes). For interpretation of the CGH data, the
following cut-off values (log values) were selected for
presence/absence call of the individual probes: 6-8 negative, 8-10 borderline/unknown and 10-12 positive. The
cut-off values were selected based on comparison of the
CGH data obtained for CFT073 (run in triplicates) and
the known genome sequence of this strain.
Phylogenetic group determination

For identification of phylogenetic group associations, a
triplex PCR method was employed, using primers targeting two genes (chuA and yjaA) and one anonymous
DNA fragment (TspE4.C) [42].
Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using Fischer’s exact
test when appropriate.
Biofilm formation in microtitre plates

Cells were grown overnight in LB and used to inoculate
flat-bottomed, non-treated 48-well plates (Nunc) to an
OD600 of 0.05. The microtitre plates were incubated statically at 37°C for 16 hours, and the biofilm stained with
0.1% crystal violet for 15 min. Excess dye was removed
by washing with PBS. Crystal violet was then solubilised
by the addition of 96% ethanol and A595 was measured.
All experiments were repeated at least three times.
Yeast agglutination and haemagglutination tests

The presence of type 1 fimbriae was assayed by the ability of the bacteria to agglutinate yeast cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) on glass slides. Ten µl of fresh
overnight cultures were mixed with 10 µl 5% yeast cells.
The experiment was repeated after the cells had been

Page 10 of 12

washed and resuspended in LB containing 50 mM
methyl-a-D-mannopyranoside.
The capacity of bacteria to express P fimbriae was
assayed by haemagglutination with human type A red
blood cells (RBCs). RBCs were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 10 µl of 5% RBCs were
mixed with a single bacterial colony (freshly grown on
LB plates) suspended in PBS on glass slides. Any strain
showing positive haemagglutination was tested again
after 30 min incubation with 1% D-mannose to rule out
type 1 fimbriae and to further support that agglutination
was likely mediated by P fimbriae.
Motility on LB plates

One µl of overnight culture was stabbed into LB plates
containing 0.3% agar. The distance of migration (the
diameter of the ring around the inoculation site) was
measured after 16 h of incubation at 37ºC. The assay
was performed in duplicates and repeated twice.
Haemolytic activity on blood agar plates

Isolated colonies were spot inoculated and production of
haemolysin was detected by determining a zone of lysis
under each colony on tryptone soya agar plates with
sheep blood (Oxoid Deutschland GmbH) after overnight
incubation of the tested strains. The assay was repeated
independently twice.
Congo Red-binding assay

The ability to express curli fimbriae was evaluated by
streaking each strain on modified LB-agar plates (without NaCl) containing 0.004% Congo Red (CR) and
0.002% Coomassie Brilliant Blue G. CR binding was
indicated by the presence of red or pink colonies after
incubation overnight at 37°C. The assay was performed
in duplicates and repeated independently twice.
