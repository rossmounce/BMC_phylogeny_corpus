Abstract
Background: Sperm morphology can be highly variable among species, but less is known about
patterns of population differentiation within species. Most studies of sperm morphometric
variation are done in species with internal fertilization, where sexual selection can be mediated by
complex mating behavior and the environment of the female reproductive tract. Far less is known
about patterns of sperm evolution in broadcast spawners, where reproductive dynamics are largely
carried out at the gametic level. We investigated variation in sperm morphology of a broadcast
spawner, the green sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis), within and among spawnings of an
individual, among individuals within a population, and among populations. We also examined
population-level variation between two reproductive seasons for one population. We then
compared among-population quantitative genetic divergence (QST) for sperm characters to
divergence at neutral microsatellite markers (FST).
Results: All sperm traits except total length showed strong patterns of high diversity among
populations, as did overall sperm morphology quantified using multivariate analysis. We also found
significant differences in almost all traits among individuals in all populations. Head length, axoneme
length, and total length had high within-male repeatability across multiple spawnings. Only sperm
head width had significant within-population variation across two reproductive seasons. We found
signatures of directional selection on head length and head width, with strong selection possibly
acting on head length between the Pacific and West Atlantic populations. We also discuss the
strengths and limitations of the QST-FST comparison.
Conclusion: Sperm morphology in S. droebachiensis is highly variable, both among populations and
among individuals within populations, and has low variation within an individual across multiple
spawnings. Selective pressures acting among populations may differ from those acting within, with
directional selection implicated in driving divergence among populations and balancing selection as
a possible mechanism for producing variability among males. Sexual selection in broadcast spawners
may be mediated by different processes from those acting on internal fertilizers. Selective
divergence in sperm head length among populations is associated with ecological differences among
populations that may play a large role in mediating sexual selection in this broadcast spawner.

Background
Spermatozoa are the most morphologically diverse cells,
yet they all have the same basic function: to fertilize an
egg. Variation in sperm shape among species can often be
attributed to sexual selection mediated by sperm competition [1-8] (but see [9]), but variation within species has
been more difficult to explain. Male-to-male variation in
sperm morphology has been documented in many species
spanning a wide range of mating systems [10,11]. Functional studies investigating the within-species association
between sperm length and fertilization success have
found an advantage of larger sperm [12-16], but sometimes the race goes to the short [17]. Most often, though,
no evidence is found for an intraspecific association of
sperm morphology and sperm competition [18-27]. Thus,
it remains unknown if selection is acting on sperm morphology in a similar way within and between species, or if
sperm are evolving under complex, possibly contextdependent selective regimes that vary among species and
populations [16,17,28].
Most studies of sperm variation focus on organisms with
internal fertilization, where sperm act in the context of an
environment controlled by the female reproductive tract
[10,16,17]. In such cases, sperm competition is dependent on multiple matings by the female and may be influenced by efforts of males to displace sperm from prior
matings or to guard females against subsequent matings
[29]. There may also be indirect effects of males on female
behavior [30].
Some external fertilizers can likewise have complex mating systems with mate choice, male-male competition,
and alternative male mating strategies [7,21,26]. However, fertilization dynamics of broadcast spawning organisms may face different selective rules. Mating occurs
when typically sessile or sedentary adults release their
gametes into the environment, resulting in external fertilization, and has been best studied in marine systems.
Some species, particularly invertebrates, have a limited
behavioral repertoire as adults and exhibit little behavioral mate choice. In dioecious species, female multiple
mating is controlled largely by the density of males in her
vicinity, and competition between males is relegated to
the level of the gamete. Sperm competition may be high
when synchronous spawning occurs in dense aggregations
[31,32], but intensity of sperm competition (as a function
of sperm density), and therefore sexual selection, may
vary over small spatial and temporal scales with changes
in population density. Furthermore, fertilization conditions may be additionally influenced by variation in factors including wave action [33,34], temperature [35-37],
or egg size [34,38], creating a selective mosaic in which no
single sperm type is universally preferred. Sperm variation

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/283

among species of broadcast spawners is well-described
[39-42] and can be associated with egg size and developmental mode [40]. While little is known about evolutionary forces acting on sperm morphology within a broadcast
spawning species, they are certainly more related to ecological environmental variation rather than to conditions
within a female reproductive tract.
A basic question is whether sperm morphology of a
broadcast spawner varies substantially among males, as
has been found in both internal and other external fertilizers [10,11]. Additionally, does sperm morphology vary
among populations, a pattern that precedes species-level
divergence? We address these questions in the green sea
urchin (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis), by examining
variation in five sperm morphometrics within and among
Pacific, West Atlantic and East Atlantic populations. We
also assess the stability of sperm parameters over time
within an individual across multiple spawnings and
within a population across two reproductive seasons.
In order to determine if selection is driving populationlevel divergence in sperm morphology, we compare quantitative genetic divergence in sperm traits (QST) with a neutral expectation of differentiation under genetic drift,
estimated by divergence at neutral microsatellite loci (FST
[43-46]). The comparison of QST with FST is a useful tool
for identifying local adaptive differentiation in fitnessrelated quantitative traits, because it allows us to test a
hypothesis of selection against three predictions [44]. If
sperm morphology is neutrally divergent among populations, we would expect to see comparable patterns of variation at both sperm morphometrics and neutral
microsatellites (QST = FST). If sperm traits are under directional selection for different optima among populations,
quantitative trait divergence should be higher than
expected under neutrality (QST > FST). Finally, if sperm
traits are evolving under homogenizing selection, population means should be more similar than expected under
neutrality (QST <FST), though this conclusion is much
more difficult to obtain with confidence. QST-FST analysis
has been applied in a wide range of taxa to address diverse
questions in evolutionary biology, e.g., [47-49].
Here, we show that sperm traits have diverged strongly
among populations as well as among individuals within
populations. At the same time, sperm morphology exhibits low variation within individual males across multiple
spawnings. We detect directional selection on sperm traits
for different population means, especially in sperm head
length between the Pacific and West Atlantic populations.
Patterns of pairwise divergence among populations suggests that ecological variables may be playing a large role
in sperm evolution of this broadcast spawner.

Results and Discussion
Variation within males
We tested sperm from multiple spawnings of males held
in culture in 2006 and 2007. Among 15 males measured
every two weeks two to five times (average = 3), head
length, axoneme length and total length did not differ significantly among spawning events (Table 1; for brevity,
only head length shown in Figure 1A). However, head
width and midpiece area showed significant within-individual variation over time. Repeatability ranged from 0.2
to 0.77, with the highest repeatabilities obtained for head
length, axoneme length and total length (Table 2). These
repeatabilities are estimates of the upper limit of broadsense heritability and were used in the calculation of QST
for each trait.

Within-male variability in sperm morphometry as measured by within-male CV did not differ for the three populations for any trait except head width (F = 8.92; P <
0.0001). CV of head length among males within a population showed a clinal pattern with lowest among-male
variability in the Pacific and highest in the East Atlantic. In
all other traits, the West Atlantic had the highest variability among males, with the lowest in Norway. Head width
was an exception, with the lowest variability among males
in the Pacific. In general, patterns of variability within and
among individuals were comparable for all traits and all
populations, but midpiece area in the East Atlantic was an
order of magnitude more variable within males than
among males. In fact, midpiece area in all populations
was much more variable than the other traits, with CV's
within males of 47.8 in the Pacific, 62.1 in the West Atlantic and 31.7 in the East Atlantic. Among-male CV's for
midpiece area were 33.1 in the Pacific, 42.5 in the West
Atlantic, and 5.6 in the East Atlantic.
In our study, we found strong evidence that sperm morphology is controlled more by developmental factors during spermatogenesis than ambient environmental
conditions. We examined repeatability for West Atlantic
males that were removed from the field and placed into a

common laboratory environment. All sea urchins were
spawned upon arrival from the field, so the first spawning
should reflect sperm morphology under the native ecological conditions of the population. Individuals were usually spawned repeatedly over a time period exceeding the
expected 21-day duration of a spermatogenic cycle ([50];
i.e., every two weeks for up to eight weeks). The result of
repeatable sperm morphology, despite a change in environmental conditions between the field and the lab, suggests that differences between males are intrinsic
properties of those males and not dominated by environmental effects. Furthermore, consistency in sperm morphology between 2006 and 2007 samples, despite
differences in laboratory conditions of temperature and
light regime, lend additional evidence to this conclusion.
Understanding how size in sperm cells is controlled
between males, and how intra-individual variance is limited will require a closer look at the molecular mechanisms controlling spermatogenesis in this system.
Ejaculate and sperm traits in fish have been shown to
adjust in response to change in social status and therefore
risk of sperm competition [51]. In addition, male fowl
exhibit phenotypic plasticity in ejaculate size [52-54] and
sperm velocity [55] under varying risk of sperm competition and depending on female number, quality and mating history. It is possible that similar plasticity exists in sea
urchins, perhaps in response to population density, but
because the captive environment was held constant for
the duration of the study, we were unable to assess any
plasticity in sperm morphology relative to sperm competition risk (e.g., density).
Variation among males
We found highly significant variation among individuals
within all three populations for all sperm traits (Table 1;
head length shown in Figure 1B) with the exception of
midpiece area in the East Atlantic population (F5,130 =
0.76, P = 0.58). Significant correlations among males were
also found between head length and width (r = -0.379, P
= 0.0006), head length and axoneme length (r = -0.349, P

Results for trait differences between measurement events (Measure), 2006 and 2007 West Atlantic sperm traits (Year), among spawnings within an
individual (Spawn), among individuals within populations (Pacific, West Atlantic, East Atlantic), and among populations (Pop). For HW, individual
differences within West Atlantic reported for 2006 and 2007, respectively, and Pop reflects separate accounting for the West Atlantic population
by year. Sperm traits are head length (HL), head width (HW), axoneme length (AL), total length (TOTAL), midpiece area (MA).

< 0.0001), and head width and midpiece area (r = 0.565,
P < 0.0001; Table 1).
An evolutionary process separate from that acting among
males may influence the developmental system that produces sperm within a male. Significant differences in
sperm morphological variation among males coupled
with high repeatability provide strong support for the
hypothesis that males control sperm morphology around
an individually based mean. Yet, there is some variation
within a spawning, and the CVs of sperm size within a
male are comparable to those among males within a population.
Variation among populations
Population means were different for all sperm traits
except total length (F2,76 = 2.9, P = 0.06), including head
length, head width, axoneme length and midpiece area
(Table 1). Sperm heads in the Pacific are long (mean head
length = 6.95 μm, SD = 0.29) and narrow (mean head
width = 1.60 μm, SD = 0.07) but in the East Atlantic, they
are short (mean head length = 5.74 μm, SD = 0.44) and
wide (mean head width = 1.94 μm, SD = 0.12), with the
West Atlantic having an intermediate head shape (mean
head length = 6.22, SD = 0.36; mean head width = 1.64,
SD = 0.13; Table 3). Axoneme length was longest in the
Pacific and shortest in the East Atlantic and negatively correlated with head length (Table 1), resulting in an overall
equality of total length in all three populations. Head
length was the only trait with significantly different means
for all populations, according to a Tukey test (Table 4).
Head width was significantly different only in the East
Atlantic population, and axoneme length increased from
west to east, with the West Atlantic not significantly different from the Pacific or East Atlantic populations. Midpiece
area was distinct only for the West Atlantic population
(Table 4).

Multivariate canonical discriminant analysis found significant among-population variation for overall sperm morphology, with two canonical variables (Figure 2; Wilks'
lambda = 10.68, P < 0.0001). CAN1 accounted for 75.7%
of the variation and had highest raw canonical coefficients
for head length, axoneme length, and total length (Additional file 1). Pairwise Mahalanobis distances among the
three populations showed Pacific sperm morphology to
be most divergent from the East Atlantic, with the West
Atlantic showing approximately equal divergence from
both the Pacific and the East Atlantic (Additional file 2).
Population trait means did not differ in the West Atlantic
between 2006 and 2007 for all traits except head width
(Table 1), suggesting that the population means for most
sperm traits are stable over at least two reproductive seasons. Further research is needed to determine longer-term
persistence of measured population means for this and
the other populations.
To date, investigations of variation in sperm morphology
among populations are limited, but population-level variation has been found across a wide range of taxa. A study
of two closely related Drosophila species found significant
differences in sperm length among individuals and populations in both species [56]. A study in Drosophila subobscura found population differences in sperm head length
but not total length [57], and [58] found significant variation among males in total length within and among four
populations of a frog.
In S. droebachiensis, substantial sperm differences among
populations could be derived from a number of causes.
The Atlantic populations probably originated from an
invasion from the Pacific 3.5 million years ago with the
opening of the Bering Strait [59]. Since that time, the western Atlantic population has received substantial influx
from the Pacific [60], while the eastern Atlantic population has remained largely separated [61]. This demographic history is reflected in its population genetics [62],
with an FST between the Atlantic populations of 0.204 and
between the western Atlantic and Pacific of 0.014. In contrast, the two Atlantic populations are more similar to
each other in overall sperm morphology than they are to
the Pacific (Table 4). In particular, QST divergence between
the Pacific and West Atlantic exceeds their pairwise FST by
a factor of 47, more than an order of magnitude higher
than for the other population comparisons and traits (Figure 3).
Ecological differences among populations do a better job
than genetic relationships at explaining the pattern of variation in sperm head length. In the Pacific, S. droebachiensis is embedded in a complex community that includes 2–
4 congeners, some of which may act as competitors for

resources. In these Pacific habitats, S. droebachiensis is currently at lower population densities than the shallow
water congeners, S. purpuratus and S. franciscanus [34], and
has been characterized as a species that is sperm-limited in
its spawning events [34,63]. In the Atlantic, on the other
hand, S. droebachiensis can form dense stands of urchins
that are capable of monopolizing the sea floor and stripping the habitat of macroalgae [64,65]. In such areas of
high population density, sperm competition will be
stronger than in most Pacific areas. The ecological similarity of the two Atlantic populations is more closely associated with the morphological similarity of sperm head
length between these two populations relative to the
Pacific. Increasing the sample size of the east Atlantic dataset and further study of historical population sizes may
provide a clearer pattern of any association between
sperm head morphology and population density among
the study populations. In addition, experimental fertilization trials will be needed to test for any functional significance of these differences.
Evolutionary processes responsible for the observed
sperm morphological variation among males may be illuminated by examining similar patterns in other male
reproductive traits. In particular, the gamete recognition
protein bindin shows strong differences between species
as well as between some populations ([66-68] but also
has high levels of polymorphism among individuals. Bindin has been shown to be evolving under balancing selection, mediated by sex-dependent, frequency-dependent,

and density-dependent selection in the red sea urchin (S.
franciscanus) [69,70], and the context-dependent nature of
bindin's fitness effects may explain both its rapid evolution and high allelic diversity [71]. If balancing selection
is also acting on sperm morphology, we might see high
morphological diversity within populations (as shown
here). We would also expect fitness effects of sperm traits
to be context dependent. These different contexts may be
characterized by variation in population density (and
therefore risk of sperm competition), egg morphology
and/or turbulence due to wave action, but further experimental evidence is needed.
Alternatively, sperm morphological traits may be evolving
neutrally among males within populations of S. droebachiensis. Determination that intraspecific variation is
under selection will require further comparisons with
other species that occur at higher abundances (e.g., S. purpuratus and S. franciscanus) and an understanding of the
dynamics of sperm precedence in males with different
sperm head sizes.
Inferring selection by comparing QST and FST
Heterozygosities and tests of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for the East Atlantic and Pacific populations are as
reported in [62] for the Vestfjorden, Norway and San Juan
Channel, Washington populations, respectively. The West
Atlantic population had a heterozygote deficit at two loci
(Loc76 and Loc63) and between 16 and 23 alleles per
locus with an average of 18.75. Global FST was 0.159, with
pairwise FST's of 0.014 between the Pacific and West Atlantic, 0.318 between the Pacific and East Atlantic, and 0.203
between the two Atlantic populations.

Quantitative genetic divergence among populations
exceeded microsatellite divergence for most sperm traits.
Average QST for the sperm traits was 0.41, with a standard
error of 0.10, as compared with FST of 0.159. ANOVAs of
trait divergence from which variance components were
obtained for calculating QST were significant for all traits
except total length. QST's for head length (QST = 0.57; P =
0.028), head width (QST = 0.65; P = 0.017), and midpiece
area (QST = 0.50; P = 0.043) were significantly higher than
FST, based on tail probabilities of QST on a chi-squared FST

distribution ([72]; Table 2), although these results are not
significant after Bonferroni correction.
Calculation of population pairwise QST and FST shows that
marginal signatures of selection at the global level are
driven entirely by highly significant quantitative trait
divergence between the Pacific and West Atlantic. Sperm
head length (QST/FST = 42.76; PX2 = 6.20 × 10-11), axoneme
length (QST/FST = 19.87; PX2 = 8.28 × 10-6) and midpiece
area (QST/FST = 33.62; PX2 = 6.68 × 10-9), are most divergent, in comparison with a pairwise FST of 0.0136 (Figure
3).
We used repeatability of sperm traits as an estimate of the
upper limit of broad-sense heritability in our calculations
of QST; the actual narrow-sense heritability for the sperm
traits may be substantially lower. However, heritability of
sperm morphometrics has been measured directly in a

number of other species and has been found to be generally high. For example, heritability of sperm head length
has been estimated to be 0.48 in zebra finches [73] and
0.72 in rabbits [74], comparable to our upper limit estimate of 0.77.
Nevertheless, the use of repeatability in the calculation of
QST requires discussion of two key points. First, because
repeatability is an upper limit on heritability, these QST
estimates represent their lower limit given the observed
phenotypic population differentiation and are therefore
not expected to further approach FST. Our estimates of QST
are thus very conservative, because heritability appears in
the denominator of the QST calculation and therefore has
an inverse relationship with QST (Figure 4). Using repeatability as an upper limit on heritability means that our QST
estimates represent a lower bound. Over all possible values of h2, QST remains above FST for all sperm traits except

total length, though both axoneme length and midpiece
area approach FST as h2 reaches 1 (Figure 4).
Second, FST and QST normally follow a chi-squared distribution ([72]), but QST as estimated using repeatability,
which estimates broad-sense heritability, no longer follows the same theoretical rules as a QST estimated with an
estimate of narrow-sense heritability. We can still calculate the tail probability of a point estimate of QST on our
chi-squared distribution of FST, but we are unable to make
any more rigorous statistical tests that take the distribution of QST into account. This limitation also applies to the
analysis of pairwise QST and FST.

As a more general precautionary note, our results, and
those of many QST-FST comparisons, should be interpreted
with a degree of caution. First, the chi-squared approximation of the FST distribution holds best when FST is less than
0.1 [72]. While our observed global FST of 0.159 may still
reasonably follow a chi-squared distribution, the predictive capability of this model is diminished. Furthermore,
an excess of QST over FST may be obtained from selection
acting not on the traits under study but on genetically correlated traits [72]. Finally, both FST and QST are historical
signatures of genetic divergence accumulated over time
and are therefore unable to identify contemporary selection. Indeed, a result of QST > FST may result from selection

or a response to past selection; these two possibilities cannot be differentiated by this analysis. Estimates of contemporary selection in this system may be especially
useful, if evolution of sperm morphology is influenced by
conditions controlling sperm competition that change on
an ecological timescale. In short, the comparison of QST
and FST is a relatively blunt tool in evolutionary biology
that can allow us to rule out genetic drift as a mechanism
for quantitative trait differentiation and identify interesting traits for further study. The implications of directional
selection derived here are preliminary at best and require
more in-depth and rigorous analyses of selection for validation and detailed characterization.
Head length and total length
Of all sperm traits examined, head length was the only
measurement to show stability over time within an individual as well as within a population, strong variation
among males within all populations, and strong differentiation among all populations. Head length also had a
strong signature of directional selection both at the global
and population pairwise levels. Patterns of head elongation among sea urchin species are associated with the evo-

lution of large eggs and direct development [40] (also see
[42]), suggesting a mechanical role for sperm head shape
in penetrating the egg's thick jelly coat. In other externally
fertilizing taxa, phylogenetic comparisons show more
ambiguity in an association between sperm morphology
and egg morphology, with a positive relationship found
in frogs [7], but not in fish [4,6]. In addition, sperm head
shape, along with relative flagellum length, is positively
correlated with risk of sperm competition across frog species [7]. The only evidence for a direct correlation between
function and morphology within a species with flagellated sperm has been found in an internal fertilizer, the
red deer [75]. Velocity is known to predict fertilization
success in a wide variety of taxa [21,76-78], including sea
urchins [79], and head shape in broadcast spawners could
play a role in swimming speed under different biomechanical conditions (e.g., turbulence, water velocity).
Total sperm length, on the other hand, showed no significant divergence or directional selection among populations. Other studies using phylogenetic contrasts and
direct experiments also fail to find a significant relationship between indices of selection, such as sperm competi-

tion, with sperm total length [18-23]. This lack of selective
signal, may be due to opposing evolutionary forces acting
on different subcomponents of sperm, such as head
length and axomenal length that comprise total length.
The negative correlation that we found between these two
measurements (Table 1) underscores the importance of
measuring subcomponents of sperm in addition to total
length.

Conclusion
We found highly significant differences in sperm morphology among individuals within all populations for
almost all traits, as well as strong population-level differentiation for head length, axoneme length, and midpiece
area. At the same time, most traits showed low variation
among multiple spawnings within a male. These results
suggest that sperm morphology tends to be developmentally stable over time, while evolutionary forces are maintaining high levels of variation among individuals and
populations of S. droebachiensis. Comparison of QST with
FST suggests that directional selection may be acting
among populations for overall sperm morphology, especially between the Pacific and West Atlantic populations,
in which sperm evolution has greatly outpaced neutral
genetic divergence.
Directional selection for different means between populations of broadcast spawners could be driven by a wide
variety of ecological differences, such as population density as a result of community structure. Individual males
also differ in sperm size within populations, suggesting
that selection on sperm traits is not only directional but
may also involve balancing selection for traits that are
most successful in different environments. Males from
many species show this pattern in reproductive traits, suggesting that balancing selection, if acting, is not mating
system-specific. It is also possible that variance between
populations and species is under selection but that variance between males is drifting neutrally. The underlying
genetic and developmental architecture that leads to variance between males in sperm morphology are largely
unknown but represent a key area of research in elucidating the evolution of complex morphological phenotypes.

Methods
Obtaining and preparing samples
We examined sperm morphology in green sea urchins
(Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis) from three populations,
from the eastern Pacific (Friday Harbor, Washington,
USA), West Atlantic (Woods Hole, Massachusetts, USA)
and East Atlantic (Bødo, Norway). Individuals were
obtained from the Pacific and West Atlantic from January
to April 2006 and from the West Atlantic from February to
April 2007. Sperm samples from the East Atlantic population were kindly provided by Nils Hagen in March 2006.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/283

In 2006, adult S. droebachiensis were maintained at 14°C
in outdoor seawater tanks under the local natural light
regime at Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove, California, USA and fed giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) ad libitum. These individuals were reproductively active until
late April. In 2007, a different cohort of adults was kept in
an indoor seawater facility maintained at 8°C under a
daily cycle of 13 hours of light and 11 hours of darkness.
These individuals were also fed kelp ad libitum and were
reproductively active through mid-June. Comparison of
sample means between the different treatment conditions
of 2006 and 2007 were done for the West Atlantic population using a t-test (see Data analysis section below).
Sea urchins were induced to spawn by injecting 0.55 M
KCl. Most individuals were spawning on arrival after shipment, allowing a baseline measurement of sperm morphology before placement in common tanks. Dry sperm
was collected off gonopores using a pipettor with a widebore tip, diluted 1:50 or 1:100 in filtered sea water (FSW),
and fixed in a final concentration of 1% paraformaldehyde and 9.25% FSW.
Sperm fixation, microscopy and morphometrics
Ten μl of fixed sperm were pipetted on a slide, and a cover
slip was applied and sealed with nail polish. Individual
spermatozoa were visualized using differential interference light (DIC) microscopy with a Zeiss Axioplan DIC
microscope at 250× to 1000× magnification. Digital
micrographs were taken using an Olympus E330, E995 or
E4500 digital camera. Measurements on images were
obtained using ImageJ software (available at http://
rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/) and converted from units of pixels to
microns based on a scale specific to the focal length of the
camera and the ocular magnification. Scales were calculated using a stage micrometer (SPI Supplies, ser. no.
CS2397).

We measured five sperm traits: head length, head width,
axoneme length, total length, and midpiece area (Additional file 3). All spermatozoa chosen for measurement
appeared normal with a visible endpiece to ensure presence of the entire axoneme. Total length did not include
the endpiece. In 2006, we measured these traits for 15
males from the eastern Pacific, 22 males from the West
Atlantic and six males from the East Atlantic (19–27 spermatozoa each). We also measured 33 males from the West
Atlantic in 2007 (ten spermatozoa each) to assess annual
variation in that population. All sperm measurements
were repeatable across two measurement events (Table 1)
at the α = 0.05 level after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons [80].
Data analysis

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:283

ated in SAS v. 9.1 (SAS Institute 2002), and only midpiece
area data were log-transformed. All statistical analyses
described below were performed in SAS, and Bonferroni
correction was applied for each analysis. Repeatability of
sperm measurements across two separate measurement
events was determined for five males (ten spermatozoa
each) from all three populations, using repeated measures
ANOVA. We also spawned 15 males from the west Atlantic population (from both 2006 and 2007) every two
weeks a total of two to five times and measured ten to 25
sperm from each spawning event to evaluate individual
variation through time. These data were also analyzed
using repeated measures ANOVA. We estimated correlations between pairwise individual trait means across the
entire dataset using Pearson correlation coefficients. We
also estimated coefficients of variation (CV) within and
among males for all populations.
We examined the 2006 and 2007 spawning seasons in the
west Atlantic population for differences in sperm morphology using a two-sample t-test and determined that
only head width was significantly smaller in 2007 than in
2006 (Table 1). For this trait, subsequent analyses considered the 2006 and 2007 samples separately for the West
Atlantic population. We used ANOVA to examine differences among individuals for each population separately
as well as among populations, using individual means.
Post-hoc multiple comparisons tests for differences of
population means were performed using Tukey tests for
all sperm traits. In order to account for population differentiation of multivariate sperm morphology, we performed a canonical discriminant analysis (PROC
CANDISC; SAS v. 9.1), which asks if sperm from all populations are morphologically indistinguishable overall.
We tested the hypothesis that the amount of divergence in
sperm traits among populations was significantly higher
than we would expect for neutral variation, indicating
directional selection for different trait means among populations. This test of selection was performed for each
sperm trait by comparing quantitative genetic divergence
or QST with FST at neutral microsatellite markers. QST was
estimated from descriptive components of variance
obtained by analysis of variance, computed using RANDOM in PROC GLM in SAS and Type III sums of squares
accounting for unbalanced design. QST was calculated as
V

GB
Q ST = V +2V
[44], where VGB is the among-populaGB
GW

tion variance for quantitative traits, and VGW is the average
within-population genetic variance.VGW, in turn, was
computed as the product of the trait heritability (h2) and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/283

the within-population component of variance (VW): VGW
= h2VW.
We derived our estimates of heritability for each sperm
trait from our measurements of repeatability, calculated
using morphometric data from multiple spawnings of the
same male [81]. Repeatability was determined using variance components of among-spawnings ANOVA and represents the maximum value of the broad-sense heritability
of a trait [82]. Heritability is inversely related to QST due to
its position in the denominator of the QST equation. As a
result, the estimates of QST calculated using repeatability
are very conservative and represent a lower limit on possible QST's over the range of heritability from 0 to 1, given
the observed among-population trait divergence.
FST at four neutral microsatellite markers was estimated
using AMOVA in Arlequin v. 2.000 [83] from published
[62] and unpublished data (J. Addison) for the San Juan
Islands, Washington, USA (n = 41); Isle of Shoals, New
Hampshire, USA (n = 144); and Vestfjorden, Norway (n =
79). All of these sites are geographically identical or proximate to those from which adults were obtained for the
sperm variation data. While FST was not estimated from
the same individuals from which sperm measurements
were taken, both the sperm morphometric and microsatellite datasets were derived from the same geographic
populations. The West Atlantic population had the largest
distance between sampling localities of the two datasets,
but previous research has shown that the West Atlantic
region experiences high levels of gene flow [62]. Therefore, we do not expect these two localities (Isle of Shoals,
New Hampshire and Woods Hole, Massachusetts) to be
significantly genetically distinct. We did not obtain a
standard error for FST, because jackknifing cannot be done
over only three populations. Mitochondrial DNA has also
been used to estimate FST [84,85], but these genes represent a single locus that may not be evolving under neutrality [86] and so were not included in this analysis.
We tested the hypothesis that our estimates of QST were
significantly different from the neutral model represented
by FST. Because FST estimates can be highly variable among
neutral loci, it is best to compare QST not to a mean FST but
to a distribution of possible FST's [72]. The distributions of
neutral FST and QST have been shown to follow a chisquared distribution under a wide range of demographic
scenarios [72]. As a result, we can compare the QST-to-FST
ratio to a chi-squared distribution with (ndemes - 1) degrees
of freedom, according to the statistic (ndemes - 1)QST/FST
[72], where ndemes is the number of demes. The p-value
associated with this statistic gives the probability that the
observed QST falls within the distribution of FST. A significant p-value for a sperm trait would indicate that it has a

low probability of being selectively neutral and a high
probability of evolving under directional selection.
To test for an effect of low sample size in the East Atlantic
population, we performed a Bartlett's test for homogeneity of variances among all populations for each sperm
trait. None of the sperm traits examined showed significant differences in variance among the populations, suggesting that although the East Atlantic sample size is
small, there was no associated increase in variance. Most
of the statistical tests performed in this study are based on
ANOVA, which assumes equal variance among samples.
Thus, we do not feel that the small sample size of the East
Atlantic population has compromised our results in any
way.
