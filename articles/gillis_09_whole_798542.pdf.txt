Abstract
Background: GATA transcription factors influence many developmental processes, including the
specification of embryonic germ layers. The GATA gene family has significantly expanded in many
animal lineages: whereas diverse cnidarians have only one GATA transcription factor, six GATA
genes have been identified in many vertebrates, five in many insects, and eleven to thirteen in
Caenorhabditis nematodes. All bilaterian animal genomes have at least one member each of two
classes, GATA123 and GATA456.
Results: We have identified one GATA123 gene and one GATA456 gene from the genomic
sequence of two invertebrate deuterostomes, a cephalochordate (Branchiostoma floridae) and a
hemichordate (Saccoglossus kowalevskii). We also have confirmed the presence of six GATA genes
in all vertebrate genomes, as well as additional GATA genes in teleost fish. Analyses of conserved
sequence motifs and of changes to the exon-intron structure, and molecular phylogenetic analyses
of these deuterostome GATA genes support their origin from two ancestral deuterostome genes,
one GATA 123 and one GATA456. Comparison of the conserved genomic organization across
vertebrates identified eighteen paralogous gene families linked to multiple vertebrate GATA genes
(GATA paralogons), providing the strongest evidence yet for expansion of vertebrate GATA gene
families via genome duplication events.
Conclusion: From our analysis, we infer the evolutionary birth order and relationships among
vertebrate GATA transcription factors, and define their expansion via multiple rounds of whole
genome duplication events. As the genomes of four independent invertebrate deuterostome
lineages contain single copy GATA123 and GATA456 genes, we infer that the 0R (pre-genome
duplication) invertebrate deuterostome ancestor also had two GATA genes, one of each class.
Synteny analyses identify duplications of paralogous chromosomal regions (paralogons), from single
ancestral vertebrate GATA123 and GATA456 chromosomes to four paralogons after the first
round of vertebrate genome duplication, to seven paralogons after the second round of vertebrate
genome duplication, and to fourteen paralogons after the fish-specific 3R genome duplication. The
evolutionary analysis of GATA gene origins and relationships may inform understanding vertebrate
GATA factor redundancies and specializations.

Background
Most animal genomes include multiple GATA transcription factor genes with widely conserved developmental
roles[1]. Within vertebrates, GATA transcription factors
are required for the proper specification of cardiac and
blood cell lineages, for the induction and differentiation
of endoderm and mesendoderm, and in cell movement
during gastrulation and neural projections. In Xenopus laevis, overexpression of GATA4, 5, or 6 can induce endoderm formation [2]. Similarly, the nematode GATA456
ortholog end-1 is necessary and sufficient to generate E or
endodermal cell fate in C. elegans, and it also can induce
endoderm when ectopically overexpressed in Xenopus [3].
The GATA transcription factor family is a relatively small
and evolutionary tractable gene family, with only six
members present in mammals, five in insects, and eleven
in the nematode C. elegans. This gene family has undergone significant expansion in bilaterians compared to
lower metazoans. For example, only a single GATA gene
has been found in two cnidarian genomes currently
sequenced [4].
Previous studies have demonstrated that the six vertebrate
GATA factors comprise two classes of evolutionarily
related genes, a GATA-1, -2, -3 class and a GATA-4, -5, -6
class [5]. These two GATA factor groups can be identified
throughout bilaterian animals, suggesting that the last
common ancestor of protostome and deuterostome
genomes contained at least two GATA genes, with both a
GATA123 and a GATA456 ortholog. Our recent survey of
GATA genes from the whole-genome sequence of multiple protostome genomes has identified at least four GATA
genes in every currently available protostome genome,
with gene duplications having occurred only within the
GATA456 class [6].
In contrast, two basal deuterostomes (invertebrate relatives of chordates), the echinoderm Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and the urochordate Ciona intestinalis, encode just
two GATA transcription factor genes, similar in number to
the predicted ancestral bilaterian state [5,7]. However,
these GATA genes are highly divergent in sequence and
bear only faint resemblance to the two GATA classes typical of most animal genomes. Indeed, a recent phylogenetic study of this gene family [8] concluded that the
small GATA gene repertoire of two in S. purpuratus and C.
intestinalis, relative to the eleven nematode and six vertebrate GATA genes, resulted from secondary and independent losses of GATA genes in these lineages. In addition to
the uncertainty about their GATA gene origins, both echinoderms and urochordates have undergone exceptional
shifts in their developmental modes relative to other deu-

terostome phyla. Thus it has remained difficult to ascertain the number, structural features, and roles of the
ancestral deuterostome GATA gene complement.
Deuterostomes include several major groups of invertebrate and vertebrate animals (Figure 1) [9-17]. The first
major deuterostome division occurred between ambulacrarians (echinoderms and hemichordates) and chordates.
The chordates then split into three groups: cephalochordates, urochordates, and vertebrates. Recent studies indicate that urochordates are the closest outgroup to
vertebrates [18], although urochordates are extremely
diverged on both molecular and morphological levels
[19]. The first split of vertebrates occurred between jawless
and jawed vertebrates (agnaths and gnathostomes), followed with the divergence of jawed vertebrates into cartilaginous and bony fish (chondrichthyes and osteichtyes).
There are two major groups of extant bony fish, ray-finned
and lobe-finned, with the former having given rise to teleost fish and the latter to tetrapods.
There is ample evidence for multiple rounds of whole
genome duplication in vertebrate lineages. Two genome
duplication events are thought to have occurred near the
base of the vertebrate lineages. The first genome duplication event (1R) has been proposed to occur prior to the
divergence of jawed and jawless vertebrates, with a second
genome duplication event (2R) occurring only in jawed
vertebrates lineage [20]. However, a more recent survey of
multiple lamprey and hagfish gene families concluded
that the ancestor of extant jawless vertebrates also underwent two whole genome duplication events, suggesting
that two rounds of whole genome duplication occurred
very early in the vertebrate lineage [21]. Finally, an additional whole genome duplication event (3R) appears to
have occurred in ray-finned fish [22-24]. During each of
these genome duplication events, two paralogous chromosomal regions (paralogons) would be created from
each pre-duplication chromosomal region, and each paralogon would initially contain a single paralog for each
pre-duplicate gene. Therefore, for each 0R (pre-duplicate)
deuterostome gene, there could be maximally two
genome-duplicated paralogs in 1R animal genomes, four
in 2R genomes, and eight in 3R genomes, though neutral
drift should quickly eliminate most of duplicated paralogs
[25-27]. We refer to paralogs resulting from genome
duplication events as ohnologs, following the convention
suggested by K. Wolfe [28] in honour of Susumu Ohno,
who first proposed the occurrence of these genome duplication events during key transitions of vertebrate evolution [26,27]. Because vertebrate genomes contain six
GATA factor genes, compared to only two in two different
deuterostome invertebrate genomes, it has been suggested

that the GATA transcription factor gene family may have
expanded in vertebrates by the retention of ohnologous
genes [5,7].
To more conclusively address the ancestral deuterostome
condition, we have identified the GATA transcription factor complement within the whole genome sequence of
two additional and less derived invertebrate deuterostomes, the hemichordate Saccoglossus kowalevskii and the
cephalochordate Branchiostoma floridae. These analyses
include nine diverse vertebrate genome sequences, and
address gene phylogeny using both gene sequence and
genomic context comparisons. Importantly, one well-conserved GATA123 gene family member and one well-con-

served GATA456 family member was found within each
invertebrate deuterostome genome analyzed. Thus our
study provides the strongest evidence yet that the ancestral
deuterostome genome contained two distinct GATA
genes, one GATA123 homolog and one GATA456
homolog, from which every deuterostome GATA gene
including the vertebrate complement originated. We conclude that hemichordates and cephalochordates have
retained members of both GATA classes. These analyses
further indicate that all vertebrate GATA genes retain conserved syntenic ohnologs, supporting the hypothesis that
the expansion of the vertebrate GATA family has resulted
almost exclusively from whole-genome duplication
events.

Results
Identification of hemichordate and cephalochordate
GATA sequences
While we recently concluded that the genome of the
ancestor to both deuterostomes and protostomes
encoded two GATA transcription factors [6,7], another
group [8] suggested that at least five GATA factors were
encoded by the genome of the last common ancestor of
fruit flies, nematodes, and vertebrates, with subsequent
losses occurring in some deuterostome lineages (see Introduction). To further address this issue, we have identified
GATA factor gene sequences from the available genomes
of two additional deuterostome invertebrates, the cephalochordate Branchiostoma floridae and the hemichordate
Saccoglossus kowalevskii.

In the cephalochordate B. floridae genome sequence, with
8.1Ã coverage, we could identify only two GATA factor
genes. tBLASTn analysis of the B. floridae trace archives
was conducted with local BLAST servers [29] to identify
~136 amino acid (AA) fragments from two distinct GATA
genes. An initial reciprocal blast suggested that these fragments encode distinct GATA1/2/3 and GATA4/5/6
orthologs, and this initial assignment was also supported
by the phylogenetic analyses below; therefore we refer to
these as BfloGATA123 and BfloGATA456. These fragments
encode a highly conserved dual zinc finger domain [5-7]
within three exons (Figure 2). Two genomic scaffolds were
identified from the pre-release genomic assembly JGIassembled genome containing these fragments http://
genome.jgi-psf.org/Brafl1/Brafl1.home.html. By conducting bl2seq sequence comparisons on larger regions of
these scaffolds, less conserved 5' and 3' ends of each gene
encoding the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of each
protein was identified.
In a BLASTn search of these two predicted BfloGATA genes
against sequenced EST libraries, 19 ESTs were identified
for the BfloGATA123, defining the full length mRNA for
this gene (1419 NT, 478 AA). Confirmation of the transcription of the BfloGATA123 gene was made by PCR
amplification of a predicted 772 nucleotide (nt) fragment
with gene specific primers from a gastrula/neurula cDNA
library.
For the BfloGATA456 ortholog, we were unable to identify any EST from the pre-release database. We therefore
defined a gene model for the 5' domain through the conserved dual zinc finger domain based on sequence comparison to human and Platynereis GATA sequences. Gene
specific primers were designed to a predicted 5' start
codon, and the conserved dual zinc finger domain. Two
clones were isolated via PCR from a Bflo cDNA library,
with 859 and 874 nucleotide inserts. Using the Splign
program [30], these fragments both aligned to the same

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/207

region of JGI:scaffold 160, and are presumably alternative
splice forms. These splice forms are identical with the
exception of alternative seconds exons, with the smaller
splice form incorporating a novel exon that eliminates the
first zinc finger domain.
In the genomic trace archive of the hemichordate Saccoglossus kowalevskii, with 7Ã coverage, we have used our
Gene Family Finder program (see Methods) to computationally identify two orthologs. A reciprocal blast analysis
suggested these to be a single GATA123 ortholog and a
single GATA456 ortholog, which held true with the additional phylogenetic analyses below, and we have therefore
named these SkowGATA123 and SkowGATA456, respectively. Through comparisons to the BfloGATA gene
sequences, four exons from each SkowGATA (Figure 2)
were identified. Within SkowGATA123, two exons encode
the conserved first and second zinc fingers, as well as two
exons 5' to the conserved zinc finger domain. No additional 3' exon sequences were identified, including the 3'
conserved domain exon described for other GATAs, but it
is possible that this sequence is divergent or not represented in the current trace archive. For SkowGATA456,
three exons that encode the first zinc finger, second zinc
finger, and a 3' conserved lysine-rich region from the conserved dual-zinc domain were identified, as well as an
additional single large 5' exon.
In summary, we have found that two additional deuterostome invertebrate genomes each have only two GATA
transcription factors genes, further supporting our previous conclusion that the last common ancestor to all deuterostomes had only two GATA factor genes.
Identification of additional vertebrate GATA factors
To further investigate the expansion of GATA factors in
vertebrates, we conducted exhaustive searches for GATA
factor members within nine vertebrate genomes, including five teleost and four tetrapod species, again using in
silico searches of annotated proteins and whole genome
contigs, as well as genomic trace files, to identify the complete GATA complement for each genome. Each of the
tetrapod genomes were found to contain six GATA factors
genes, consistent with previous studies [5,8]. However, we
also identified seven or eight GATA factor genes in each of
the teleost genomes examined (Figure 3, 4, 5). The expansion from two pre-genome duplication (0R) GATA factors, to six GATA factors in the tetrapod (2R), and eight in
the teleost (3R), is consistent with GATA family growth
via genome duplication.
Identification of class specific motifs
We next examined the cephalochordate and hemichordate GATA genes to determine if they include GATA123and 456-class specific conserved coding sequence motifs,

identified in a previous study [7]. BfloGATA123 exhibits
one of the most complete and well conserved set of
ortholog-specific motifs from our data set (Table 1 and
Figure 2), containing all 7 previously identified motifs,
which exhibit 38â76% amino acid identity with at least
one other example of that motif. BfloGATA456 contains
all 4 motifs identified within human GATA456 orthologs,
and an additional N-terminal motif previously only identified in the Platynereis PdumGATA456, the sea urchin
SpurGATAe, and the sole anemone GATA NvecGATA.
Similar to BfloGATA456, SkowGATA456 includes 3 N-terminal motifs identified within human GATA456
orthologs, and an additional N-terminal motif previously
identified only in the Platynereis PdumGATATA456, the
sea urchin SpurGATAe, and the sole anemone GATA
NvecGATA. No SkowGATA123 conserved C-terminal
motifs were detected, but all five previously identified
motifs N-terminal to the zinc finger domains could be
identified.
Conserved splice site boundaries within the two
deuterostome GATA classes
To further analyze deuterostome GATA gene family members, we next examined conservation of exon/intron structures. The genome assemblies were compared to the
translated amino acid sequence to map splice sites and
exon/intron boundaries. When the B. floridae cephalochordate and S. kowalevskii hemichordate GATA genes
were compared to their human, fish, and sea anemone
orthologs, we found all of the genes contain two internal
introns that divide the conserved dual-zinc finger domain
into first zinc finger, second zinc finger, and 3' lysine rich
encoding exons (Figure 2). The positional conservation of
these two introns correlates with the high conservation of
the dual zinc-finger domain, relative to the rest of the protein, in almost all animal GATA transcription factors [6].
Thus, an ancestral exon/intron structure of the core conserved DNA binding domain has been retained in both
deuterostome GATA123 and GATA456 gene families.

We also identified differences in the exon/intron boundaries of GATA123 and GATA456 genes, 5' and 3' of the conserved dual-zinc finger regions. These differences produce
distinctive exons that encode the class specific N- and Cterminal motifs [7]. The cephalochordate BfloGata456,
the hemichordate SkowGATA456, and the echinoderm
GATA456 ortholog SpurGATAe, as well as the human
HsapGATA4, 5, and 6 genes and the zebrafish DrerGATA5
and 6 genes, all have a single exon 5' of the zinc finger
domain exons, with this one exon encoding all of the
identified GATA456 motifs. However, BfloGATA123,
SkowGATA123, and the human and zebrafish GATA 1, 2
and 3 genes all are encoded by two 5' exons, with two conserved motifs located within the first exon and three

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/207

within the second. A comparison to the motifs shared
with NvecGATA found that this intron has been observed
only within bilaterian GATA123 factors [6]. We therefore
suggest that the single 5' exon in GATA456 genes may represent the ancestral condition for all GATA genes, and that
a subsequent intron insertion occurred shortly after the
duplication of the ancestral GATA gene in the GATA123
lineage.
In contrast to their 5' exons, the 3' structure of the deuterostome GATA123 genes is more conserved than the 3'
structure of the GATA456 genes. The analyzed cnidarian,
echinoderm, cephalochordate, and vertebrate GATA123
orthologs each have only a single large 3' exon (though we
have not yet found any 3' exons in the hemichordate
SkowGATA123), and all of these orthologs contain two
identifiable conserved motifs in this region. In contrast,
the 3' ends of the GATA456 genes are more variable, and
no conserved motifs have been identified among these
genes; human and zebrafish GATA 5 and 6 genes, and the
zebrafish GATA 4 gene, are split into 3 short exons, the
first of which is conserved in the cephalochordate
BfloGATA456. These additional two 3'-most exons appear
to be diagnostic for vertebrate GATA456 genes. However,
the echinoderm GATA456 ortholog has two large 3'
exons, while only a single short 3' exon can be identified
in the hemichordate or cephalochordate GATA456
orthologs, though these identifications may not be complete due to a lack of sequence conservation in these
regions. Thus, it appears that lineage-specific acquisition
of 3' exon/intron structure and sequence divergence has
occurred for GATA456 factors, whereas the GATA123 factors appear to retain a 3' structure similar to that of the
sole anemone NvGATA gene. Our analysis of the classspecific features, including both conserved amino-acid
motifs and intron/exon boundaries, provides further support to the view that all deuterostome GATA genes are
members of either the GATA123 for the GATA456 subfamilies.
Prediction of an additional 5' exon in the S. purpuratus
GATA123 gene (GATAc)
Because two 5' exons are conserved in chordate and hemichordate GATA genes, and because echinoderms are a sister group to the hemichordates, we were surprised that
only one 5' exon was described in the previously characterized echinoderm GATA123 ortholog, SpurGATAc. Furthermore, motifs encoded by the 5' most exon in other
deuterostome GATA123 genes are also present in protostome GATA123 orthologs [7], suggesting that either the
S. purpuratus GATAc gene lost its first exon at some point,
or that the gene is currently incorrectly annotated. Using
tBLASTn searches of the S. purpuratus genomic sequence
with the 5' exon from BfloGATA123, but not with those
from other deuterostome GATA123 genes, we identified a

Phylogeny of deuterostome GATA123 and GATA456 subfamilies
Phylogeny of deuterostome GATA123 and GATA456 subfamilies. Phylogenetic trees for GATA123 genes (a) and
GATA456 genes (b). Branch support is given in both posterior probabilities from a Bayesian analysis (bold) or from the
approximate likelihood ratio test chi-square parameter (regular). Both trees are rooted using the Platynereis ortholog. Species
names are as follows; Bflo-Branchiostoma floridae (cephalochordate), Drer-Danio rerio (zebrafish), Ggal-Gallus gallus (chicken),
Gacu-Gasterosteus aculeatus (stickleback), Hsap-Homo sapiens (human), Olat-Oryzias latipes (medaka), Skow-Saccoglossus kowalevskii (acorn worm), Spur-Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (sea urchin), Pdum-Platynereis dumerilii (annelid), Regl-Raja eglanteria
(skate), Trub-Takifugu rubripes (fugu), Tnig-Tetraodon nigroviridis (tetraodon), Xtro-Xenopus tropicalis (frog).

Syntenic4genes with GATA123 locus from seven vertebrate sequences
Syntenic genes with GATA123 locus from seven vertebrate sequences. Gene names given from ENSEMBL, location
on chromosome represented in megabase. The colored blocks represent syntenic genes are part of paralogy groups syntenic
with other GATA loci, following the color scheme in Figure 6.

207 base pair (bp) region with significant (p = .002) similarity, approximately 18 kilobase (kb) upstream of the
current exon 1 in the SpurGATAc gene. This sequence
includes an open reading frame of 69 residues with an Nterminal motif 64% identical in amino acid sequence to
the corresponding motif in BfloGATA123 (27% to
PdumGATA123., 50% to NvecGATA123., 56% to
MmusGATA2). However, this open reading frame begins
abruptly within this motif and does not include a 5' start
codon. This result appears to be consistent with tBLASTn
searches of the S. purpuratus genomic trace archive
directly, in which 22 of 23 traces identified containing this
ORF also have a stop codon at the same position [*QVDVYYHH.], suggesting that this stop codon is not a
sequencing error. Therefore, there could be an additional

short 5' exon that we have not found, or perhaps this exon
has degenerated and is now a pseudo-exon.
Molecular phylogenetic analysis of deuterostome GATA
genes
To better define the relationships between all deuterostome GATA factors, we conducted a series of molecular
phylogenetic analyses. We first analyzed the complete set
of the collected GATA factors, using the conserved zinc
finger domains and aligning newly identified factors to a
previously defined alignment [6]. These analyses consistently resolved GATA123 and GATA456 subfamilies (Additional File 1), but could not fully resolve relationships
within the GATA123 and GATA456 clades. Alignments of
GATA123 and GATA456 full length protein sequences

were highly variable and generated results similar to those
obtained using the conserved zinc finger domain only
(data not shown).
Alignments that compared only GATA123 or only
GATA456 subfamily members resulted in greater convergence of the gene tree to the species tree (Figure 3a/b). We
found that invertebrate GATA123 and GATA456 genes
formed separate clades outside of the vertebrate GATA123
and GATA456 clades, respectively, consistent with the 2R
origin of the additional vertebrate GATAs. Within the
individual vertebrate clades, there was a clear separation
of tetrapod and teleost genes, and only minor changes to
the species tree were observed within these groupings
(compare Figure 3 to Figure 1). Outside of vertebrates, the
cephalochordate GATA genes BfloGATA123 and
BfloGATA456 group with the ambulacrarian orthologs

(hemichordates and echinoderms), but this is likely due
to the high degree of conservation and low level of divergence for both the hemichordate and cephalochordate
genes.
Our results also suggest distinct ancestral relationships
within each vertebrate GATA class. Within the GATA123
class (Figure 3a), a closer relationship was observed
between the GATA2 and GATA3 members, to the exclusion of a more rapidly evolving GATA1 group. In contrast
to previous results [5], and consistent with other recent
results [8], a closer relationship between the GATA5 and 6
groups, to the exclusion of the GATA4 group, was
observed within the GATA456 class.
In conclusion, these molecular phylogenetic analyses support the presence of two classes of GATA factors through-

Dual-ZF Domain

The percent identity shared between motifs and conserved domains from cephalochordate (Bf), hemichordate (Sk), and echinoderm (Sp) GATAs

out deuterostomes. Deuterostome invertebrates possess
single GATA123 and GATA456 genes, and the deuterostome GATA gene family has expanded in a manner consistent with several rounds of whole genome duplication
at the base of the vertebrate lineages. See the Discussion
for further consideration of these results.
Syntenic conserved paralogs and the identification of
genome-duplicated GATA paralogons
Based on the above analysis, we hypothesize that (i) the
last common ancestor to all deuterostomes had one
GATA123 gene and one GATA456 gene within its
genome, and (ii) multiple rounds of whole genome duplication account for the expansion of vertebrate and teleost
GATA genes. If this hypothesis is correct, then we should
be able to detect duplicated GATA paralogonsâconserved,
syntenic paralogs associated with the corresponding paralogous GATA lociâwithin the vertebrate evolutionary lineage. To test this prediction, we characterized the adjacent

genomic regions for each vertebrate GATA locus, searching for examples of tightly linked loci that have been
duplicated together as a result of whole chromosome
duplications. Although a superficial analysis of conserved
synteny has been published [8], which describes a 'segregation' of vertebrate GATA genes on multiple chromosomes, we now describe deeper syntenies of orthologs
across species and paralogs within species, and use this to
completely describe the paralogons and their context during genome duplication events.
In support of GATA gene family expansion via genome
duplication, we found numerous gene families with conserved synteny across the GATA loci. We first described
genes syntenic with GATA123 and GATA456 loci across
each of the vertebrate species (Figures 4, 5, Additional
Files 2, 3 &4; see Methods). This data was used to identify
gene families with paralogs syntenic in multiple GATA
loci in fish and/or tetrapod species (Figures 6b, 7b). These

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:207

results allowed us to define the predicted GATA paralogons within each vertebrate genome. Overall, thirteen
ohnologous gene families were identified as shared
between at least two of the four paralogous GATA1/2/3
regions (Figure 6a, Figure 4). Likewise five gene families
are shared between the paralogous GATA 4/5/6 regions
(Figures 5, 7a). Thus, all vertebrate GATA genes are
located within extensive paralogons providing strong support for an origin of the vertebrate GATA gene complement by whole genome duplication events from two
ancestral GATA loci, one GATA123 gene and one
GATA456 gene.
By comparing the differential pattern of gene loss versus
gain between the GATA paralogons within and among
these vertebrate species, we infer the evolutionary birth
order of the GATA paralogons by determining the most
parsimonious pattern of ohnolog retention (Figures 4, 5,
6a, 7a). In this analysis, we describe clade-specific conserved losses of duplicated paralogs, though it is also formally possible that these 'losses' may represent the
translocation of a pre-duplication gene into or out of a
paralogon prior to a gene duplication event. Nevertheless,
all cases are phylogenetically informative.
For the GATA123 family (Figure 6a), we conclude that the
initial 1R duplication of the ancestral GATA123 paralogon generated a GATA1/1-ogm (ohnolog gone missing,
see [31]) and a GATA2/3 paralogon, and was followed by
seven subsequent paralogous gene losses. The GATA1/1ogm paralogon lost four ohnologs, whereas the GATA2/3
paralogon lost three ohnologs (for lost ohnolog identities, see legend of Figure 6). Furthermore, within the
GATA2/3 paralogon the ITIH gene apparently underwent
a tandem local duplication, before the 2R duplication,
resulting in the ITIH1/2/3 genes and the ITIH4/5 genes.
Following the 2R duplication, the GATA1 paralogon
duplicated to generate two distinct paralogons, GATA1
and GATA1-ogm (ohnolog-gone-missing, as the second
GATA1 ohnolog has been lost), while the GATA2/3 paralogon gave rise to the distinct GATA2 and GATA3 paralogon. After the 2R duplication of both GATA1/1b and
GATA2/3 paralogons, only seven paralogous gene losses
are required to explain the inferred composition of the
four resulting ancestral vertebrate GATA123 paralogons.
According to our scenario, the GATA1 paralogon lost one
ohnolog, the GATA1-ogm paralogon lost three ohnologs
(including a second GATA1), the GATA3 paralogon lost
three ohnologs, and the GATA2 paralogon lost none.
For the GATA456 family, we propose that the initial 1R
duplication generated a GATA5/6 paralogon and a
GATA4/4-ogm paralogon (Figure 7). This 1R duplication
was followed by a severe reduction of the GATA4/4-ogm
paralogon resulting in a minimum of three gene losses

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/207

within this paralogon. In contrast, no gene losses occurred
within the 1R GATA5/6 paralogon. We speculate, that
subsequently the 2R duplication generated the GATA5
and GATA6 paralogons, and the relatively diminished
GATA4 and GATA4-ogm paralogons. Due to the extensive
loss of ohnologs in the latter two, we have been unable to
identify a paralogous region representing the GATA4-ogm
paralogon. However, our current analysis indicates that
one ohnolog is missing from the GATA5 paralogon, and
one ohnolog is missing from the GATA6 paralogon, with
each of these two ohnologous genes being retained within
the GATA4 paralogon. In contrast three pairs of ohnologs
are shared between GATA5 and GATA6 paralogons.

Discussion
Invertebrate deuterostomes genomes encode sole
GATA123 and GATA456 orthologs
To examine the evolution of GATA transcription factors in
deuterostomes, including vertebrates, we searched for and
identified single-copy GATA123 and GATA456 orthologs
in two basal deuterostomes, the cephalochordate Branchiostoma floridae and the hemichordate Saccoglossus kowalevskii. Single-copy GATA123 and GATA456 orthologs
have also been identified in two other basal deuterostomes, the echinoderm Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and
the urochordate Ciona intestinalis. However, the B. floridae
and S. kowalevskii genes are more conserved in sequence
compared to the previously described invertebrate deuterostome GATA genes. This conservation includes near
complete sets of GATA123 and GATA456 class specific
sequence motifs [7], and conserved intron/exon boundaries in the gene regions that encode these motifs. Our findings confirm previous phylogenetic inferences that the
genome of the last common ancestor to all deuterostomes, like the bilaterian ancestor, encoded one GATA123
and one GATA456 transcription factor, with subsequent
duplications giving rise to the multiple family members
present in vertebrate deuterostome genomes.
Reconstructing the ancestral exon/intron structure and
evolution of the GATA gene
By comparing the exon/intron structures of deuterostome
GATA genes, we can infer the structure of the ancestral
deuterostome (Ud) GATA orthologs, as well as the ancestral eumetazoan (Em) ortholog. All three of these genes
contained a conserved dual-zinc finger domain encoded
in three central exons, which encode the first zinc finger,
second zinc finger, and a lysine-rich region. However, the
3' and 5' regions appear to vary among these genes. We
infer that both the EmGATA and the UdGATA456 genes
included a single 5' exon to this conserved domain, while
the UdGATA123 gene contained two 5' exons. As conserved sequence motifs can be identified within the two 5'
exons of the GATA123 genes, and also within the single
5'exon of the sole Nematostella GATA gene, we infer that

Evolution of GATA1/1b/2/3 chromosomal regions. Evolutionary scenario leading to the expansion of the chordate
GATA123 paralogon into the four GATA1, 2, 3, and 1b paralogons during two rounds of genome duplication (a). The reconstructed GATA paralogon(s) for the vertebrate ancestor is shown after the 1R genome duplication (light grey box), or the 2R
genome duplication events (medium grey box). Paralogs in the 0R vertebrate genome that can be strongly inferred when
present in both the GATA1/1-ogm paralogon and the GATA2/3 paralogon (represented by diamond), or when synteny is also
conserved in the cephalochordate genome (downward-pointing triangle); otherwise it is not clear if these genes were translocated independently into the 1R paralogons. Changes to the paralogons from the inferred 2R state of the last common bony
fish/tetrapod ancestor (medium grey box) to the extant amniote or teleost state (dark grey box) (b). Three red bars across the

the 5' region of the UdGATA123 gene gained an additional intron.
Although the 5' exon-intron structure of UdGATA456 is
more similar to the NvecGATA exon/intron structure, the
3' end of GATA456 orthologs exhibits more variable features. Both the NvecGATA and the GATA123 genes terminate with the third exon of the conserved domain, while
GATA456 orthologs contain a truncated third conserved
domain exon as well as one or more novel 3' exon(s). This
third-conserved domain exon encodes ~27 conserved
amino acids of a lysine rich region. However, the
GATA123 and NvecGATA genes encode a less-conserved
terminal end with two C-terminal motifs. In comparison,
this lysine-rich exon is shorter in GATA456 orthologs than
in the GATA123 or NvecGATA genes, and lacks C-terminal
sequence motifs. Furthermore, GATA456 genes contain
novel exon(s) 3' to the conserved domain, and we have
been unable to identify conserved motifs from this additional region, suggesting that the 3' region has undergone
significant evolutionary change in GATA456 paralogs.
All vertebrate GATA456 genes have lost the ancestral Nterminal motif N1, which is present within deuterostome
invertebrate GATA456s, and within the protostome annelid Platynereis dumerilii GATA456 ortholog. A BLAST
search of the human N-terminal region against the NR
protein database fails to find this motif in any vertebrate
GATA transcription factor, suggesting that this motif may
have been lost early in vertebrate evolution.
Greater sequence conservation of GATA123 orthologs
Comparison of different deuterostome GATA genes to the
sole cnidarian GATA (NvecGATA) gene also suggests that
GATA123 genes are more slowly evolving then their
GATA456 counterparts. This can be seen both in the
higher percent identity shared between the conserved
domains of the deuterostome GATA123 and NvecGATA
genes (Table 1), the high affinity of the BfloGATA123 with
the NvecGATA, and the total number of common motifs
we can identify. Perhaps GATA123 genes are more constrained due to their retention of a deep ancestral function, while the GATA456 class might be more diverged
due to the selection or incorporation of bilaterian or phylum specific roles. This view is consistent with previous
comparisons of the GATA gene complement in multiple
protostome genomes. Almost all protostomes possess a
single copy, more slowly evolving GATA123 gene,
whereas the GATA456 genes expanded in many protostomes by sequential tandem duplications and subsequent modifications to their gene structure [6]. However,
the expression patterns currently described for deuterostome and cnidarian GATA factors are not consistent with
retention of a deep ancestral function within the
GATA123 class. Whereas NvecGATA mRNA is largely

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/207

restricted to the endoderm in the cnidarian Nematostella
[4], with only a small ectodermal expression domain, the
vertebrate GATA-1, -2, and -3 are expressed and function
mostly within ectodermal tissues and blood, but not in
the endoderm [1]. However, GATA gene expression has
not been examined in many cnidarian species, and thus
any inference of any ancestral GATA function deeper in
animal phylogeny than bilaterians is still premature.
Expansion of vertebrate GATA transcription factor genes
during two rounds of whole genome duplications
Our previous work and this analysis suggest that the last
common ancestor to both protostomes and deuterostomes had single GATA123 and GATA456 genes. But
these two GATA classes have undergone distinct expansions using different mechanisms during the subsequent
evolution of different animal phyla. In protostomes, only
the GATA456 class appears to have undergone expansion,
at least in part by tandem duplications within individual
chromosomes. By contrast, in vertebrates, both the
GATA123 and the GATA456 family have expanded
through the retention of duplicated GATA genes that originated during two rounds of whole genome duplication
[32]. Our molecular phylogenetic analysis, and our analysis of conserved syntenic paralogs, both support expansion by whole genome duplication and furthermore
suggest a specific evolutionary order for these duplication
events (compare scenarios in Figure 6a and 7a to the
clades defined in Figure 2).

Our molecular phylogenetic analysis of GATA123 genes
(Figure 3a) reveals a closer relationship between GATA2
and GATA3 orthologs, to the exclusion of a more rapidly
evolving GATA1 group. It is not surprising that the GATA2
and GATA3 genes show more affinity to each other, as
GATA1 appears to be a fast-evolving ortholog relative to
other vertebrate GATAs. Nevertheless, these relationships
are further supported by the retention of more syntenic
paralogs between the GATA2 and GATA3 loci, then
between the GATA1 and either GATA2 or GATA3 loci.
However, the conservation of syntenic paralogs between
GATA1 and either GATA2 or GATA3 strongly supports
common evolutionary origin of all three from an ancestral
GATA123 paralogon. We therefore conclude that GATA2/
3 and GATA1 intermediates were generated after the 1R
vertebrate genome duplication, and that one GATA1
ohnolog (chromosomally-duplicated paralog) was lost
after the 2R duplication.
In contrast to previous results [5] but consistent with
other more recent results [8], our molecular phylogenetic
analysis suggests a closer relationship between the GATA5
and 6 groups, to the exclusion of the GATA4 group. However, despite the differing outcomes in previous molecular
phylogenetic analyses, our synteny analysis is consistent

Evolution of GATA4/5/6 chromosomal regions
Evolution of GATA4/5/6 chromosomal regions. The evolutionary scenario describes losses and gains of paralogous
genes near GATA456 during two rounds of genome duplication. (a) The duplications of the 0R chordate GATA456 paralogon
are shown for the three GATA4, 5, and 6 paralogons (the GATA4b paralogon could not be identified). The reconstructed
GATA paralogon(s) for the vertebrate ancestor is shown after the 1R genome duplication (light grey box), or the 2R genome
duplication events (medium grey box). Paralogs in the 0R vertebrate genome can be strongly inferred when present in both the
GATA4/4-ogm paralogon and the GATA2/3 paralogon (represented by diamond); otherwise it is not clear if these genes were
translocated independently into the 1R paralogons. (b) Progression from the inferred 2R state of the last common vertebrate

CABLES2), abhydrolase domain containing proteins (ABHD1/ABHD3), and sox transcription factors (SOX7/SOX18).

with our phylogenetic analysis, and further supports a
closer relationship between the GATA5 and 6 groups. We
conclude that the 1R genome duplication produced
GATA4 and GATA5/6 intermediates, and an additional
GATA4-ohnolog had been lost after the 2R genome duplication.
Additional gene duplications in teleosts
We also find evidence for additional teleost-specific
ohnologs in the GATA123 lineage, but not in the
GATA456 lineage corresponding to an additional round
of genome duplication at the base of teleost fish. This evidence stems from both overlaying the species phylogeny
on the gene phylogeny (compare Figure 1 to Figure 3) to

find additional 3R duplicates, but more conclusively from
the comparisons of duplicated paralogons. In all, four
additional teleost paralogs have been identified, and two
of these paralogs clearly resulting from larger chromosomal duplications.
The topology of our molecular phylogenetic analysis (Figure 3a) indicates a teleost-wide duplication of the GATA2
gene into separate GATA2a and GATA2b genes, most
likely originating from the 3R teleost-specific genome
duplication event. Although the topology of zebrafish
GATA2b within the tree is slightly off, possibly due to its
long branch indicating its derived sequence, the presence
of conserved syntenic genes between the tetrapod GATA2

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:207

paralogon and the teleost GATA2a and GATA2b paralogons strongly suggests that these duplicated via a chromosomal duplication.
The zebrafish genome also contains a second GATA1
duplicate that appears to originate from the 3R duplication. Although only found in zebrafish, our phylogenetic
analysis suggests that this GATA gene may have resulted
from the 3R duplication, and was secondarily lost early in
the ancestor of all other teleost. This view is consistent
with zebrafish being the most basal member of the fish
species represented in this analysis. However, this view is
also supported by the presence of two identifiable GATA1
paralogons within each teleost fish genomes (Figure 4,
Figure 6b, Additional File 4), although the second GATA1
gene is missing in these additional teleost paralogons with
the exception of zebrafish.
Although we see no evidence for additional teleost
GATA456 ohnologs from a 3R round of genome duplication, the Tetraodon (green spotted pufferfish) genome
does contain two GATA5 paralogs. However, the topology
of our molecular phylogenetic analysis suggests a more
recent origin via a Tetraodon-specific gene duplication, as
opposed to retained genome duplicate.
Our analysis of conserved synteny demonstrates the presence of additional duplicated paralogons, even when a
second GATA paralog is not identified (see Additional File
4 for complete Discussion). Therefore, our data based on
the comparative analysis of GATA paralogons in vertebrates strongly supports a third genome duplication event
(3R) at the base of teleost fish.
It is notable that so many (6/8) of these GATA transcription factors were retained after the first two rounds of
genome duplication on the base of the vertebrate branch.
In comparison, a recent analysis from the cephalochordate genome could identify retention of genome duplicated paralogs in only about one quarter of all human
gene families, with a much smaller fraction containing
multiple ohnologs [33]. Furthermore, only 2/6 ohnologs
(GATA1a/1b, zebrafish GATA2a/2b) were retained after
an additional teleost-specific whole genome duplication
event. Apparently, the integration and preservation of
GATA transcription factors into the gene regulatory networks was a more probable outcome after the two early
rounds of whole genome duplication (1R and 2R), and
less likely after the third round (3R). In addition, after
these early genome duplications at the base of the vertebrate lineage, the GATA gene family has remained static in
most vertebrate species. After the 2R duplication event, all
of the examined tetrapods maintained exactly six GATA
transcription factor genes. After the teleost-specific 3R
genome duplication, only a single gain of a GATA5 dupli-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/207

cate in Tetraodon, and a loss of the GATA2b ohnolog in the
ancestor of the acanthopterygian fish, has occurred.
The presence of two distinct GATA factor classes in basal
deuterostomes, and their subsequent expansions in vertebrates, informs the understanding of studies indicating
functional redundancy within each GATA class. For example interfering with the function of all three GATA456
orthologs in Xenopus laevis embryos results in a much
more severe endoderm defect than does an inhibition of
the function of only one or two of them. Similarly, reducing the function of only one or two GATA456 paralogs
only partially blocks cardiac mesoderm induction in both
zebrafish and Xenopus [2,34,35]. The overlapping expression domains in the CNS for the GATA2 and 3 [36] and in
hematopoietic lineages for GATA123 orthologs [1] may
suggest that these GATA factors also have redundant functions. Similarly, the GATA123 and GATA456 gene families in nematodes are both highly redundant in their
requirements. The use of C. elegans GATA456 gene duplicates at multiple nodes and levels in an endodermal gene
regulatory network provides the furthest understood
model so far for retention, cooption, and integration of
gene duplicates within a gene network over evolutionary
time [37].
While these gene expansions and functional redundancies
can complicate studies of GATA functions, both the hemichordate and the cephalochordate posses only single copies of each GATA factor class. Both of these basal
deuterostomes also exhibit many widely conserved morphological features that are thought to resemble the
ancestral states for both deuterostomes and chordates,
respectively (reviewed in [38-41]). Thus these basal deuterostomes are appealing model organisms in which to
investigate conserved functions for the GATA123 and
GATA456 classes of developmental regulatory transcription factors.

Conclusion
The above molecular phylogenetic analyses, as well as
comparisons of conserved intron/exon structure and
sequence motifs, demonstrates that the last common
ancestor to all deuterostomes had only two GATA factor
genes, one GATA123 and one GATA456 gene, within its
genome. These analyses confirm that the GATA family of
transcription factors has expanded via whole genome
duplications in vertebrates. During the 1R and 2R genome
duplication, this family expanded to three GATA123 and
three GATA456 genes that are conserved across vertebrates. The 1R genome duplication gave rise to GATA1
and GATA2/3 paralogs, as well as GATA4 and GATA5/6
paralogs, while single GATA ohnologs were lost from the
GATA1 and GATA4 lineages after the 2R event. In addition, the teleost 3R genome duplication has resulted in 1

or 2 additional GATA123 duplicates in fish species. Both,
our molecular phylogenetic analysis and conserved paralogon analysis are in support of the same birth order and
relationships between GATA123 and GATA456 subfamilies members.

3' regions based on our in silico predictions. These fragments appear to be alternate splice forms, with the smaller
clone (BfloGATA456-isoform b) encoding an alternative
second exon, resulting in the loss of the first zinc finger in
this isoform.

The identification of single GATA123 and single
GATA456 orthologs in the more conserved hemichordate
and cephalochordate genomes highlights how these basal
deuterostomes may provide useful model systems for
investigating conserved GATA factor requirements without the functional redundancies observed in vertebrates.
Additionally, although this paper focuses on GATA factor
gene relationships, our analysis has also identified eighteen other gene families contained within paralogous gene
groups. The reconstructed evolutionary history of these
vertebrate GATA paralogons provides a new basis for
understanding the origin and evolution of these paralogous gene families as well.

For BfloGATA123 PCR amplified a 772 base pair fragment
(corresponding to nt129â1070 of the published
BfloGATA123 cDNA) using nested gene specific primers
F1BfG123 (BfGATA123 â F129) 5'-AGACATCGACGTGTTCTTCCACCA-3'; F2BfG123 (BfGATA123 â F300) 5'CATGCAGTGGATCGAGAGTACCAA-3'; R1BfG123 (Bf

Methods
Identification of Branchiostoma floridae GATA
sequences
Initial identification of two GATA gene fragments was
conducted using tBLASTn analysis of the B. floridae trace
archive. These fragments were used to search for the chromosomal regions containing these sequences in the draft
genome (1.0) of B. floridae. BfloGATA123 was found on
JGI_Scaffold27 (2842113â2842359), as well as an allelic
copy on JGI_Scaffold 383; in the newer version (2.0), only
one BfloGATA123 containing contig was found (on
Bf_V2_141).
BfloGATA456
was
identified
on
JGI_Scaffold160 (117014â51465), as well as an additional allelic copy on Scaffold_714; two allelic contigs
were also found in the second assembly (on Bf_V2_327
and Bf_V2_265. Additional sequence on the 5' and 3' ends
were identified via BLAST 2 Sequences (bl2seq) [42] comparisons against GATA123 and GATA456 orthologs from
Platynereis, S.purpuratus, and vertebrate GATA sequences.
We also identified 19 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) for
the single BfloGATA123 gene, which allowed a precise
definition of the full-length coding sequence of this gene
(1419 NT, 478AA). No published ESTs were available for
the predicted GATA456 sequence.

We amplified by PCR these two GATA fragments from a B.
floridae gastrula-neurula stage cDNA library, generously
provided by James Langeland [43]. For BfloGAT456, we
isolated two different sized clones (859 nt and 874) using
the following primers: F1BfG456 (BfloGATA456-'MYQ')
5'-ATGTACCAGAATCACTCCGTCGCG-3';
R1BfG456
(BfloGATA456- '3'aln') 5'-ATTACTGGTGCTAGTTGGAGGCTTGC-3, designed to conserved regions from the 5' and

Identification of Saccoglossus kowalevskii GATA
sequences
A bioinformatics pipeline, Gene Family Finder (GFF), was
developed to facilitate the identification of gene-family
members within genomic trace archives, and used to
search for GATA genes from the hemichordate Saccoglossus
kowalevskii (Additional File 5). This tool takes a user protein sequence, and compares this to a local genomic trace
DNA BLAST database using protein-translated nucleotide
(tBLASTn) comparison. The program then clusters all the
initial hits into unique groups of redundant traces by taking into account the greater divergence between nucleic
acid sequences relative to amino acid sequence. Our program iterates through the initial hit list, performing a
BLASTn search on the hit identifying overlapping traces
based upon an e-value cut off. These overlapping traces
are then collected into their own unique hit file, and used
to remove these traces from the initial results list. These
unique-hit redundant traces are assembled into a larger
DNA contig using the CAP3 program [44]. These contigs
are compared to the input sequence using the bl2seq program, and these results are parsed to display both the
aligned region, and translation(s) of the contig based
upon significant bl2seq identified frames. To test the utility of this program, we compared the results of previous
analyses [6], and were able to identify conserved open
reading frames (ORFs) for the complete GATA gene complement in various protostome species. In addition, we
confirmed the utility of GFF to identify very divergent
GATA sequences in whole genome trace archives of the
urochordate Oikopleura dioica, that exhibits one of the
most divergent invertebrate deuterostome genome
sequences. GFF was able to identify two divergent GATA
gene family members orthologous to the GATA gene complement found in two urochordates C.intestinalis and
C.savingii (data not shown). Searching the current trace
archive of S.kowalevskii from the NCBI trace archive

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:207

(8,246,246 sequences; last updated April 9, 2008) we
identified a total of 8 ORFs that belong to a sole
SkowGATA123, and a sole SkowGATA456 gene.
Identification of vertebrate GATA sequences
Protein sequences were collected from ENSEMBL database (v52) for four tetrapods, frog (Xtra-Xenopus tropicalis), chicken (Ggal-Gallus gallus), mouse (Mmus- Mus
musculus), and human (Hsap â Homo sapiens), as well as 5
teleost species, zebrafish (Drer â Danio rerio), medaka
(Olat â Oryzias latipes), stickleback (Gacu â Gasterosteus
aculeatus), fugu (Trub â Takifugu rubripes), and tetraodon
(Tnig â Tetraodon nigroviridis), and was combined with our
own annotated sequences for a hemichordate (Skow â
Saccoglossus kowalevskii), lancelet (Bflo â Branchiostoma
floridae) and a polychaete (Pdum â Platynereis dumerilii).
In cases where a single gene encoded multiple transcripts,
we selected the protein that appeared to be most complete, e.g. most closely followed the ancestral intron/exon
pattern (described below). Each of the vertebrate genomes
was searched again using tBLASTn analyses, to add additional unannotated GATA factors from these genomes
(primarily from fish species). We used our gene family
finder program to further probe the zebrafish genome
(which could identify all eight zebrafish GATA factors).
Additional sequences were collected from the NCBI protein database for single GATA factors isolated from the
hagfish (Ebur â Eptatretus burgeri) and skate (Regl â Raja
eglanteria), and for the previously identified chicken
GATA1 cDNA sequence. The chicken GATA1-cDNA
appears to be missing in the current chicken assembled
genome, and cannot be identified via tBLASTn searches of
the genomic trace sequence, along with many other genes
syntenic with this region of human and mouse chromosome X. The lack of this entire chromosomal regions, but
the presence of a chicken GATA1-cDNA sequence and
other cDNAs syntenic with the GATA1-paralogon (see
Additional File 4), suggests that this region may have been
missed during sequencing of the chicken genome.
Phylogenetic analysis
Protein sequences from each vertebrate and invertebrate
deuterostome genome (excluding the highly divergent
Urochordate genes) were aligned using MUSCLE [45],
and an initial round of phylogenetic analysis (data not
shown) was used to divide the sequences into either
GATA123 or GATA456 transcription factors. These files
were then re-aligned using MUSCLE to improve subfamily
alignments.

Topology of the phylogenetic trees were generated from a
Bayesian analysis with MrBayes (version 3.1 parallel, on
an eight processor linux system) [46], using the Gamma
rate parameter and the WAG model, and is based upon
the consensus tree of two converged runs of 3,000,000

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/207

generations using 4 chains, burnin of 500,000 generations; branch support represent posterior probabilities. A
maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis was conducted using PHYML-alrt (v2.4.4) [47,48], using the WAG
model, 4 substitution rate categories, and maximum-likelihood estimates for the gamma distribution parameters
and proportion of invariable sites. Branch support is given
via the approximate likelihood test Chi-square based parametric branch supports.
Motif and splice site analysis
GATA123 and GATA456 motifs outside of the conserved
dual-zinc finger domain were identified as described previously [7], and were manually aligned to the S. kowalevskii and B. floridae orthologs. A motif was identified if it
shared at least a 20% pairwise identity with another example of that motif. Splice boundaries were identified by
using the Splign program [30].
Synteny analysis
To examine the GATA genomic microenvironment, we
identified genes syntenic with 6 GATA loci across chicken,
mouse, and human (amniote) chromosomes. This was
done using the ENSEMBL genome browser (release 52),
selecting the ContigView for each of the 6 human GATA
loci, and then using the view syntenic location option
with either chicken (Gallus gallus) or mouse (Mus musculus). As the gene order was largely consistent across all
three amniote vertebrates, an ancestral amniote chromosomal region for each of the six GATA loci was based upon
their order first in the human genome, and then by their
location in mouse or chicken (if absent from human);
however, using chicken or mouse first results in a very
similar gene order suggesting that all of three species
largely retained their ancestral synteny for this region.

We then proceeded to identify orthologs of genes syntenic
around the human GATA loci from three fish species;
zebrafish, medaka, and stickleback, using a reciprocal best
BLAST hit (RBH) prediction database [29]. Additionally,
we used the ENSEMBL BioMart (V52), starting with genes
from the human chromosomal regions identified above,
to collect human paralogy annotations as well as orthology annotations in seven analyzed vertebrate genomes.
Similar analyses were conducted to compare the 6 human
and 12 zebrafish GATA loci to current Branchiostoma
genome assemblies (V1.0 and V2.0), though only a limited number of syntenic genes were identified between
vertebrates and cephalochordates.
