Abstract
Background: Current information about the expansion of Bantu-speaking peoples is hampered by the scarcity
of genetic data from well identified populations from southern Africa. Here, we fill an important gap in the analysis
of the western edge of the Bantu migrations by studying for the first time the patterns of Y-chromosome, mtDNA
and lactase persistence genetic variation in four representative groups living around the Namib Desert in
southwestern Angola (Ovimbundu, Ganguela, Nyaneka-Nkumbi and Kuvale). We assessed the differentiation
between these populations and their levels of admixture with Khoe-San groups, and examined their relationship
with other sub-Saharan populations. We further combined our dataset with previously published data on Ychromosome and mtDNA variation to explore a general isolation with migration model and infer the
demographic parameters underlying current genetic diversity in Bantu populations.
Results: Correspondence analysis, lineage sharing patterns and admixture estimates indicate that the gene pool
from southwestern Angola is predominantly derived from West-Central Africa. The pastoralist Herero-speaking
Kuvale people were additionally characterized by relatively high frequencies of Y-chromosome (12%) and mtDNA
(22%) Khoe-San lineages, as well as by the presence of the -14010C lactase persistence mutation (6%), which likely
originated in non-Bantu pastoralists from East Africa. Inferred demographic parameters show that both male and
female populations underwent significant size growth after the split between the western and eastern branches
of Bantu expansions occurring 4000 years ago. However, males had lower population sizes and migration rates
than females throughout the Bantu dispersals.
Conclusion: Genetic variation in southwestern Angola essentially results from the encounter of an offshoot of
West-Central Africa with autochthonous Khoisan-speaking peoples from the south. Interactions between the
Bantus and the Khoe-San likely involved cattle herders from the two groups sharing common aspects of their
social organization. The presence of the -14010C mutation in southwestern Angola provides a link between the
East and Southwest African pastoral scenes that might have been established indirectly, through migrations of
Khoe herders across southern Africa. Differences in patterns of mtDNA and Y-chromosome intrapopulation
diversity and interpopulation differentiation may be explained by contrasting demographic histories underlying the
current female and male genetic variation.

Background
Among the complex series of demographic events that
shaped the patterns of human genetic variation in Africa,
the massive dispersal of Bantu-speakers stands as one of
the most impressive examples of human migration. Both
linguistic and archeological evidences suggest that the
spread of Bantu languages started about 4000 years ago in
the adjacent grasslands of Cameroon-Nigeria and
involved large movements of farmers carrying an agricultural tradition especially well-suited to the climate conditions prevailing in subequatorial Africa [1,2]. According to
a widely accepted dispersion model, one major population movement involved the expansion of ancestors of
East Bantu speakers along the northern fringe of the African rain forest into the interlacustrine areas surrounding
Uganda [1-3]. Another important movement is thought to
be linked to the early penetration of ancestors of West
Bantu speakers into the wet coastal areas of the central
African forest, beyond the Cameroon plateau [2]. More
recent major expansions would include the migrations of
West and East Bantu speakers into the dry territories
located beyond the southern borders of the rain forests,
which eventually culminated with the diffusion of Bantu
languages across southern Africa [1,2]. However, this
basic representation of the major trends of Bantu dispersals has not remained unchallenged [3-5], and many specific details of the migration dynamics leading to the
emergence of widespread Bantu-speaking communities
are still poorly understood [3].
Genetic data have great potential for unraveling the complex population history underlying Bantu expansions, but
there are a number of difficulties related to sampling coverage and parameter estimation that need to be overcome.
So far, most of the available genetic information has been
gathered in phylogeographic studies of Y-chromosome
and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation. These studies identified several mtDNA haplogroups likely to be
associated with the Bantu migrations that trace their
ancestries to different geographic regions of Africa [6]. In
contrast, the great majority of Bantu Y-chromosome lineages were found to belong to a single widespread haplogroup (E3a), which seems to have overrun most preexisting diversity [7-9]. Recently, a few studies have begun
to address more detailed aspects of regional mtDNA variation by increasing both the resolution of sequence data
and the density of population sampling [10,11]. However, in spite of this progress, current understanding of
Bantu expansions is still hampered by lack of sampling of
crucial regions in subequatorial Africa. The area of Angola,
in particular, has remained persistently underrepresented
in most studies of African genetic variation [12]. Although
new genetic data has become available from Kimbundu
and Bakongo speakers from northern Angola and Cabinda [13,14], no information exists on the broad area

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/80

encompassing the dry woodlands to the south of the
Cuanza river, which is critical for understanding the push
of West Savanna Bantu-speaking peoples out of the rain
forest into the arid steppes of southwestern Africa.
Being exposed to the effects of the Benguela current,
southern Angola provided a new environment characterized by increasing levels of aridity that challenged the progression of the agricultural lifestyle that had
predominated in the well irrigated lands of the Congo
basin [1,2]. Faced with this environmental shift, some
groups, like the Ovimbundu, settled the high grounds of
the Bié plateau where they could find areas of relatively
fertile soil and higher rainfall [2]. In the coastal areas, and
further to the south, settlements had to be limited to
major river valleys and subsistence economies became
increasingly dependent on cattle raising. The Herero, the
Ovambo and the Nyaneka-Nkhumbi are examples of such
Bantu groups in southwestern Angola and form a broad
cultural and economic cluster relying on cattle raising to
various degrees [15,16]. Among them, the Herero are the
most exclusively pastoral of all Bantu peoples from southwestern Africa and penetrated well into the arid regions of
the Namib Desert where they shared their mode of life
with neighboring non-Bantu Khoe cattle herders [17].
This cultural and geographical proximity between Bantu
and Khoisan-speaking groups poses intriguing questions
about the development of the Southwest African pastoral
scene and the nature of the interactions between the vanguard of West Bantu speakers and the non-Bantu peoples
from the desert. For example, the role played by Khoe
herders in the adoption of the present pastoral specialization of Bantu speakers is still not clear [18]. Moreover, the
relative isolation of Southwest Africa from the major East
African pastoral centers represents an important challenge
for the identification of the migration routes that led to
the emergence of a cattle-herding zone in the southwestern periphery.
Here we present an analysis of the western edge of the
Bantu expansions based in the study of Y-chromosome,
mtDNA and lactase persistence genetic variation in West
Savanna Bantu-speaking groups from southwestern
Angola. We analyzed the data in the context of regional
and continental genetic diversity by assessing the differentiation between these populations and their levels of
admixture with Khoisan-speaking groups, and by examining the relationship between southwestern Angola and
other areas of Africa. Furthermore, we combined our dataset with published data on Y-chromosome and mtDNA
variation from Southeast Africa to explore a general isolation with migration (IM) model [19,20] and infer key
demographic parameters underlying the history of Bantu
expansions.

Methods
Population Samples
Buccal swabs were collected from 54 Kuvale, 153
Nyaneka-Nkhumbi, 21 Guanguela, 96 Ovimbundu, and
45 Bantu-speaking individuals with other ethnic affiliations. Individuals were grouped according to self-identified ethnicity, and only samples from unrelated
individuals were included in the study. Samples were collected after informed consent in donors' hometowns and
villages located in the administrative province of Namibe,
southwestern Angola (Figure 1A). Besides including the
original core area of Herero-speaking peoples, the province is presently inhabited by different ethnic groups due
to relatively recent migrations from surrounding areas.

The groups included in our sample represent WestSavanna Bantu-speaking populations [22] from the
southwestern edge of the Bantu expansions (Figure 1A)
and rely on different combinations of agricultural and
pastoral lifeways. The Ovimbundu form the largest ethnolinguistic cluster in Angola, making up 35% of the total

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/80

population. Their original core area was located in the Bié
plateau, but they underwent a series of southward expansions that considerably enlarged their territory and are
presently one of the major groups inhabiting Namibe
[15,16] (Figure 1A). Traditionally, most Ovimbundu
groups practiced mixed farming and kept livestock. However, cattle raising was not crucial for subsistence and few
families owned large herds [15]. The Nyaneka-Nkhumbispeaking groups, who have also spread to present-day
Namibe, originally settled the area located West from the
middle Cunene River, including the Huíla plateau in the
eastern limit of the Namibe province (Figure 1A). These
peoples are agro-pastoralists that depend in part on cultivation, but keep large cattle herds and use dairying products as an important source of subsistence [16,23]. The
Kuvale people dwell in the arid lowland areas of the
Namibe province and are one of the most representative
Herero-speaking groups from Angola [17] (Figure 1A).
Like other groups included in the Herero cultural division,
they are semi-nomadic cattle herders and rank among the
most exclusively pastoral peoples of southwestern Africa.

The Ganguela-speaking peoples originally settled southeastern Angola, which is well removed from Namibe (Figure 1A). However, during the Angolan civil war many
Ganguela families flew to neighboring countries and to
other regions of Angola, including Namibe. The Ganguela
originally included a number of scattered farming communities that were split by the southern expansion of the
Chokwe peoples in the 19th century. The populations that
remained in the western side of the Chokwe penetration
progressively adopted cattle and became mixed farmers
[16].
Laboratory methods
mtDNA
We have sequenced both hypervariable segments I (HVSI; positions 16024–16400) and II (HVS-II; positions 73–
340) of the mtDNA control region. MtDNA sequencing
was performed as described previously [14]. All HVS-I and
HVS-II sequences are shown in Additional file 1. To assign
mtDNA sequences to previously defined haplogroups, we
initially followed established criteria based on HVS-I
sequence variation [6,24] updated as recently discussed
[25]. Occasional ambiguities in these assignments were
resolved by additional typing of a selected set of four diagnostic restriction fragment length polymorphisms
(RFLPs): 3592 HpaI (absent in L3), 2349 MboI (present in
L3e), 10084 TaqI (present in L3b) and 8616 MboI (absent
in L3d). After this initial assignment step, we used the
available information on HVS-I and HVS-II variation provided by published complete mtDNA sequences to refine
and/or rename the classifications according to the most
recently updated mtDNA phylogeny [26] (see Additional
file 1). For the sake of comparison we refer to the HVS-Ibased nomenclature throughout the article.
Y-chromosome
To characterize the nonrecombining portion of the Ychromosome (NRY) we genotyped 9 unique event polymorphisms (UEPs; M2, M35, M60, M91, M112, M150,
M213, YAP, SRY4064) and 11 short tandem repeats
(STRs; DYS19, DYS389I, DYS389II, DYS385, DYS390,
DYS391, DYS392, DYS393, DYS437, DYS438, and
DYS439). The DYS385 locus consists of a duplicated tetranucleotide STR region and was omitted from some analyses. Except for YAP, UEPs were typed by direct sequencing
of PCR products. Primer sequences and protocols are provided upon request. Short tandem repeats were typed with
the Promega Powerplex Y System. All Y-chromosome
combined haplotypes, defined by UEP and STRs, are
shown in Additional file 2. For the sake of comparison
NRY haplogroups based on the UEP variation were
named according to the Y-chromosome Consortium
guidelines [27,28], but we also provide haplogroup
names according to a most recent update [29], which in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/80

our dataset essentially involves the renaming of haplogroup E3a as E1b1a (see Additional file 2).
Lactase persistence
Lactase persistence was screened by direct sequencing of a
359 bp PCR fragment located within intron 13 of the
MCM6 gene, which contains all single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that have been so far associated with
lactase persistence in human populations: G/C -14010; T/
G -13915; C/T -13910; and C/G -13907 [30-32] (see Additional file 3 for typing details). In addition to the southwestern Angolan sample, we further typed the lactase
persistence-associated SNPs in a total of 111 Bantu speaking individuals belonging to 11 different population
groups from Mozambique: 3 Chopi, 4 Chwabo, 19
Makhwa, 15 Makonde, 15 Ndau, 11 Nyanja, 15 Ronga, 2
Sena, 15 Shangaan, 1 Shona and 11 Tswa.
Data analyses
Summary statistics for mtDNA and Y-chromosome haplotype variation, and Tajima's D and Fu's Fs tests were calculated and performed with the ARLEQUIN 3.11 software
package [33]. Analyses of molecular variance (AMOVA) to
evaluate the apportionment of genetic variation were also
performed using ARLEQUIN 3.11. Correspondence analysis based on mtDNA and Y-chromosome haplogroup frequencies was performed using the POPSTR program [34].

Population cross-comparisons for the mtDNA data were
restricted to the 16090–16365 HVS-I sequence range and
were based in an assembled dataset comprising approximately 5400 mtDNA profiles from 73 populations (Figure
1B and Additional file 4). For the NRY data, cross-population comparisons were based either on UEP-defined haplogroups or on higher resolution haplotypes defined by a
subset of 7 STR loci (DYS19, DYS389I, DYS389II,
DYS390, DYS391, DYS392, DYS393) common to all samples assembled in a database of about 5072 haplotypes
from 72 populations (see Additional file 5). Networks of
NRY haplotypes and mtDNA sequences were constructed
using the NETWORK 4.5 software [35]. For NRY haplotypes, the reduced-median [36] and median-joining [37]
algorithms were applied sequentially and differential microsatellite weighting was used to resolve extensive reticulation at microsatellite loci. Weights for each
microsatellite were inversely proportional to the ratio of
the variance displayed by each marker within the respective haplogroups and the average variance value across
loci in those haplogroups. For mtDNA sequences, the
median-joining algorithm [37] was used without further
weighting. Ages of mtDNA and NRY lineages were estimated with the ρ (rho) statistic [38] using NETWORK 4.5,
assuming 25 years per generation, a mtDNA control
region mutation rate of μ = 7.55 x 10-6 per nucleotide per
generation, based in a recent Bayesian estimate [39], and

the following NRY-STR per generation mutation rates
[40]: μDYS19 = 0.0017; μDYS389I = 0.0019; μDYS389II = 0.0023;
μDYS390 = 0.0023; μDYS391 = 0.0035; μDYS392 = 0.0006;
μDYS393 = 0.0007.
Admixture proportions were estimated with the
ADMIX2.0 program [41]. MtDNA-based estimates were
calculated from haplogroup frequencies without taking
into account molecular distances between haplogroups.
NRY-based estimates were calculated from the frequency
of haplotypes defined by STR loci DYS19, DYS389I,
DYS389II, DYS390, DYS391, DYS392, and DYS393, not
taking into account molecular distances between haplotypes.
We have also attempted to infer the key demographic
parameters of Bantu expansions by analyzing our NRY
and mtDNA data from southern Angola together with
additional data from Southeast Africa (see Additional files
4 and 5) within the framework of a general isolation with
migration (IM) model [19,20], using the IMa program
[42]. The IM model describes the historical demographic
properties of two related populations that may have varied in size after diverging from a single ancestral population, with bidirectional migration occurring at constant
rate following the initial split [19,20]. Thus, we reasoned
that this framework could be applied to populations
located in the two opposite edges of the Bantu expansions
in order to analyze the split between the eastern and western streams of Bantu dispersals after a common origin in
an area likely to be located in West-Central Africa (see
Additional file 6). The model has six parameters whose
posterior probability distributions can be estimated by
using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach
implemented in the IMa computer program [42]: effective
population sizes for both extant (N1 and N2) and ancestral
(NA) populations, time since divergence (t) and migration
rates in both directions (m1 and m2). These demographic

terms are obtained by conversion from estimated basic
parameters that are scaled by the mutation rate (per locus
per generation): θA = 4NA μ; θ1 = 4N1 μ; θ2 = 4N2 μ; t = tμ;
m1 = m1/μ; m2 = m2/μ. The mtDNA dataset consisted of
724 HVS-I 276 bp-long sequences ranging from positions
16090 to 16365, including 358 sequences from southwestern Angola, collected in the present study, and 366
assorted sequences from different ethnic groups from
Mozambique and Zimbabwe (see Additional file 4). The
NRY data consisted of 348 haplotypes defined by 7 STR
loci totaling 236 Y chromosomes from the present Angolan sample and 112 chromosomes from Mozambique
(see Additional file 5). Parameter conversions were done
by using the aforementioned mtDNA control region and
NRY STR mutation rates. After preliminary runs to determine plausible uniform prior ranges, the IMa program
was run for at least 10 million steps after 100000 steps of
burn-in with 8 Metropolis-coupled chains, with geometric
heating. For each dataset at least two independent replicates were performed using the same running options and
a different random seed to assess convergence of the
parameter estimates. MtDNA sequences were assumed to
mutate under the Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano (HKY) finite
sites mutation model [43]. Mutation in NRY STRs was
modeled by the stepwise mutation model (SMM). The
mode of each marginal posterior distribution generated
by the program was considered a point estimate of the
corresponding parameter value. Reported parameter estimates are means from replicate runs.

gest that subsistence economy and population history had
a measurable impact in the demography of the peoples
from southern Angola. The semi-nomadic Herero-speaking Kuvale pastoralists display the lowest value of θk (=
14.61), and fail to reveal any significant signal of population expansion, as reflected by the nonsignificance of both
Tajima's D and Fu's Fs tests (Table 1). By contrast, the
Ovimbundu and the Nyaneka-Nkhumbi agro-pastoralist
groups exhibit higher levels of haplotype diversity and
have significantly negative Fs values that are consistent
with a history of demographic expansion. In order to confirm that the differences in Fs values were not influenced
by sample size, we recalculated the Fs values in random
subsamples of the Nyaneka-Nkhumbi and the Ovimbundu that matched the lower sample sizes of the
Ganguela (N = 21) and the Kuvale (N = 54). For N = 21,
Fs values remained significant for the Ovimbundu (Fs = 6.57; P = 0.01) but became nonsignificant for the
Nyaneka-Nkhumbi (Fs = -3.97; P = 0.06). With N = 54, Fs
values remained significant both for the Ovimbundu (Fs
= -24.42; P = 0.00) and for Nyaneka-Nkhumbi (Fs = 11.40; P = 0.008), suggesting that the absence of traces of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/80

population expansion in the Kuvale is not attributable
their lower sample size.
Haplogroup composition
To investigate the relationship between Namibe and other
African populations, a correspondence analysis based on
mtDNA haplogroup frequencies was performed using
contextual samples from different Sub-Saharan regions
(Figure 1B; Additional file 4). The southern African KhoeSan samples distort the correspondence analysis (data not
shown) due to their genetic uniqueness (high frequencies
of haplogroups L0d/k) and were excluded from further
analysis in order to achieve better resolution of the genetic
relationships among populations.

Figure 2A shows the results of the correspondence analysis
after exclusion of the Khoe-San samples. To facilitate
graphical display, populations from Southeast Africa,
which are known to be genetically homogeneous [6], were
pooled into a single group. Samples from the northern
Angolan regions of Cabinda and Luanda (here designated
as Angola) were also combined. The pooled sample from

Namibe lies in a cluster including most West-Central African populations, Angola and Southeast Africa. Pygmies
display unusually high frequencies of haplogoup L1c and
are clear genetic outliers. Despite some genetic continuity
between West-Central and West Africa, the geographic
regions of West-Central, West and East Africa seem to be
well correlated with mtDNA variation, as populations
from different regions tend to cluster around different
coordinates. Furthermore, when populations were classified by four major geographic regions (West, East, Southeast and West-Central Africa) and two additional outlier
ethnic groups (Pygmies and southern African Khoisanspeakers), AMOVA analysis showed that 14.2% of the variability lies between groups, 4.8% among populations
within groups and 81% within populations (all P values
<0.01).
Most mtDNA haplotypes that are commonly found in
Sub-Saharan populations were also observed in Namibe
(see Additional file 1; Figure 2C). The most frequent
(>5%) haplogroups were L0d (6%), L0a1 (9%), L0a2
(8%), L1c1 (8%), L1c2 (7%), L2a1 (10%), L3e1 (9%),
L3e2 (7%) and L3f (6%). Haplogroup L1c1a, which is typical of Pygmy populations from Central Africa [10,11],
was virtually absent from our sample (see Additional files
1; Figure 2C). The relatively high frequency of the typical
Khoe-San L0d haplogroup contrasts with previous findings from northern Angola [13,14] but compares with
observations in Bantu groups from Southeast Africa
[6,44]. However, this haplogroup is not evenly distributed
in the Namibe samples and reaches much higher frequencies in the Kuvale (22%; Figure 2D) than in other groups.
When correspondence analysis is focused on the four populations from Namibe (Figure 2B) the genetic peculiarity
of the Kuvale caused by the high frequency of L0d
becomes obvious.
Patterns of lineage sharing
In order to analyze the likely origin of mtDNA sequences
from southwestern Angola, we used the comparative
mtDNA African dataset (see Figure 1B and Additional file
4) to study the patterns of HVS-I lineage sharing between
Namibe and other Sub-Saharan populations. Although
restriction of population cross-comparisons to the HVS-I
control region increases the number of available samples,
it is important to note that some matches may involve
sequences that are phylogenetically unrelated. However,
these cases are expected to seriously bias the conclusions
only if convergence episodes are non-randomly distributed across lineages.

We evaluated the patterns of haplotype sharing using
matching scores based both on individual sequences and
on haplotypes. Matching scores based on individual
sequences count the number of individuals from Namibe

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/80

with at least one match in a given African region. Matching scores based on haplotypes, count the number of different haplotypes from Namibe with at least one match in
a given African region. We found that 76% of all individual sequences and 53% of the different haplotypes sampled in Namibe match at least one sequence from
elsewhere. Figure 3 shows the distribution of shared lineages across different Sub-Saharan populations. As much
as 96% of all individual mtDNAs from Namibe that were
found to be shared with other African populations had
matches with West-Central Africa, or with regions up
north in Angola (Cabinda and Luanda), which lie close to
plausible migration paths between West-Central and
Southwest Africa (Figure 3A). Lineage sharing with either
West or East Africa is significantly lower and represents
37% and 60%, respectively, of all shared sequences from
Namibe. Although lineage sharing between Namibe and
the southeastern Africa is high (Figure 3), ~97% of the
observed matches were found to be also shared with WestCentral Africa. The link between southwestern Angola and
West-Central Africa is not restricted to haplogroups that
are thought to have originated in this region, like L1c or
L3e [6,24]. Even shared sequences belonging to haplogroups that may trace their phylogenetic origin back to
regions outside West-Central Africa were found to match
sequences that occur around this area (see Additional file
7). Consideration of shared haplotypes instead of individual sequences replicates these overall sharing trends (Figure 3B).

Lineage sharing with Pygmies and southern African
Khoisan-speaking peoples is low (Figure 3). Even the
sequences that belong to the typical Khoe-San L0d haplogroup did not match any Khoisan-speaking population
from the database. However, network analysis clearly
shows that the Angolan L0d lineages are phylogenetically
related to other typical Khoe-San sequences from southern Africa (see Additional file 8). We have attempted to
calculate the age of the unmatched L0d lineages by estimating the average number of mutational changes to their
closest southern African ancestor, using the ρ statistic
(data not shown). Estimated ages were found to vary
between 4816 (± 4816) and 17308 (± 9667) years.
Admixture analysis
Although patterns of lineage sharing suggest that a substantial fraction of the mtDNA pool from southwestern
Angola may have derived from West-Central Africa,
important contributions from other regions cannot be
firmly ruled out due to the relatively low proportion of
lineages that are shared exclusively with each of several
potential source areas (Figure 3). To complement the
study of matching patterns, we used an explicit model of
admixture [41] in which the southwestern Angolan population was considered to be a hybrid containing variable
contributions from five different parental regions and
populations (Table 2): West Africa, West-Central Africa,
East Africa, Pygmies and the southern Africa Khoe-San
(see Additional file 4). This model oversimplifies the
complex demographic scenarios underlying the Bantu
migrations by assuming that the Namibe pool was instantaneously created by combining different proportions of
parental populations. However, the location of Namibe in
a border of the Bantu expansion range, where different
populations could have merged, seems to justify the use of
this admixture model as an exploratory tool to assess the
relative contribution of different putative source regions.

Despite being associated with high standard deviations,
estimates of the admixture proportions are consistent

with a major (0.74 ± 0.15) contribution of West-Central
Africa to the southwestern Angola mtDNA pool (Table 2).
Contributions from West Africa (0.04 ± 0.07), East Africa
(0.04 ± 0.06) and the Pygmies (0.05 ± 0.05) seem to have
been residual and significantly lower than that from
southern African Khoisan-speaking peoples (0.13 ± 0.02).
Moreover, it is interesting to note that the calculated contribution from the Khoe-San in each population group
shows a stepwise increase that appears to be correlated
with the degree of dependence on animal husbandry of
the different groups: Ganguela (0.03 ± 0.02) < Ovimbundu (0.07 ± 0.03) < Nyaneka-Nkhumbi (0.12 ± 0.03) <
Kuvale (0.33 ± 0.08). The relatively low standard deviations associated with these estimates reflects the high levels of differentiation of the Khoe-San, showing that the
use of an admixture model is more adequate when parental populations have remained isolated for a long time.
Y-chromosome
Haplotype diversity
In accordance with the trend observed for mtDNA (Table
1), NRY diversity in STR-defined haplotypes loci was
found to be lower among the Kuvale (θk = 24.6) than in
the Nyaneka-Humbi (θk = 60.3) and the Ovimbundu (θk
= 61.1), revealing a consistent pattern of population size
reduction and genetic drift in the Kuvale group.
Haplogroup composition
Figure 4A displays the results of a correspondence analysis
based on SNP-defined NRY lineages, summarizing the
genetic relationships between Namibe and other subSaharan populations. Populations where the majority of
NRY lineages belong to haplogroup E3a-M2 -including
Namibe, northern Angola (Cabinda), West-Central Africa
Bantu groups, West Africa and the Pygmies- are clustered
together (Figures 4A and 4C). West-Central African populations located in the upper-right quadrant of the correspondence analysis plot are non-Bantu populations from
Northern Cameroon with high frequencies of C, FR haplogroups. South African and East African Khoisan-speak-

ing groups lie close to each other in the lower-right
quadrant, which groups populations where B2b-M112
and E3b-M35 haplogroups are common, including all
samples from East Africa (Figures 4A and 4C). A single
West African pooled sample from Mali (coded as 12 in
Figure 1B; see Additional file 5) is also located in the
lower-right quadrant due to a high frequency of E3b-M35.
However, due to paraphyly of the E3b-M35 clade [45], the
sharing of E3b-M35 may not indicate a close genetic relationship between East Africa populations and the West
Africa sample. When populations were classified into the
same major groups defined for mtDNA (West Africa, East
Africa, Southeast Africa, West-Central Africa, Pygmies and
southern African Khoisan-speakers), AMOVA analysis
showed that 18.2% of the variability lies between groups,
18.8% among populations within groups and 62.3%
within populations (all P values <0.01). This apportionment reflects the high levels of genetic heterogeneity
observed in populations from the same broad geographic
area.
Although the majority (~80%) of Y-chromosome lineages
in southwestern Angola belong to haplogroup E3a-M2

(Figure 4C; see Additional file 2) the distribution of the
remaining lineages is not uniform across the Namibe
samples (Figure 4D). The small sample from the
Ganguela has E(xE3a, E3b) lineages that are less common
in the other groups, while the Kuvale and the the
Nyaneka-Nkhumbi carry the B2b-M112 haplogroup,
which is known to be frequent both in Pygmies and
Khoisan-speakers [8,9,46]. Figure 4B emphasizes the
influence of the E(xE3a, E3b) and B2b minor haplogroups
in separating the Ganguela and Kuvale from the NyanekaNkhumbi and the Ovimbundu. This local pattern is
remarkably congruent with that obtained with mtDNA
(Figure 2B).
Patterns of lineage sharing
To study the patterns of lineage sharing in the Y-chromosome, we used the populations from the comparative NRY
African dataset with reported haplotype data for a common set of seven STR loci (see Additional file 5). Due to
the high level of convergent evolution among NRY haplotypes based on this limited subset of STRs, the possibility
of phylogenetically unrelated matches cannot be completely ruled out, as for mtDNA.

Approximately 75% of the total number of Y chromosomes and 52% of different haplotypes from southwestern Angola had at least one match with another African
population. As observed for mtDNA, most Y-chromosome matches involved West-Central Africa (92% of
shared Y chromosomes; 81% of shared haplotypes; Figure
5). Levels of Y-chromosome sharing with Southeast Africa
were also high (72% of Y chromosomes; 42% of haplotypes), but ~97% of these individual matches (85% of different haplotypes) were shared with West-Central Africa.

number of mutational changes to the closest southern
African ancestor were found to vary between 19445 (±
13749) and 29168 (± 20624) years.
Admixture analysis
As for mtDNA, we used an explicit admixture model to
infer the relative contributions of different African regions
to the sampled southwestern Angola Y-chromosome
pool. However, admixture calculations based on the fre-

sharing between individual Y chromosomes A) and haplotypes B) from southwestern Angola and from other population groups in Africa. Only Y chromosomes or haplotypes
that were found to be shared between southwestern Angola
and at least one other African population were included in
the calculations. Haplotypes were defined by STR loci
DYS19, DYS389I, DYS389II, DYS390, DYS391, DYS392,
DYS393. Abbreviations are the same as Figure 2.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/80

quencies of SNP-defined haplogroups lead to estimates
that were associated with high standard deviations and
often exceeded the 0–100% range under different combinations of parental populations. As these implausible
results were likely to be due to the high similarity of haplogroup frequency profiles of West and West-Central
Africa, both dominated by the E3a-M2 haplogroup, we
performed a higher resolution analysis using the frequencies of haplotypes defined by a common set of 7 STR loci
(see Additional file 5). At this level of resolution, the E3aM2 haplotype subset defined by alleles 15-21-10-11-13 at
loci DYS19, DYS390, DYS391, DYS392 and DYS393,
which has been considered a founder lineage of Bantu
expansions [7], has very different frequencies in WestCentral (~0.24) and West Africa (~0.08).
To perform the STR-based admixture reanalysis, we
excluded all haplotypes that did not reach a minimal 0.02
frequency threshold in at least one source region or in the
whole Namibe sample. West-Central Africa and West
Africa were the only supported source regions in most calculations (Table 3), with West-Central Africa providing
the major admixture contribution (0.88 ± 0.19), as
observed for mtDNA. Only the Nyaneka-Nkhumbi
showed a signal for a possible Khoe-San contribution
(0.12 ± 0.17), but we note the large standard deviation
associated with this calculation.
Lactase persistence
Given the well known association between lactose tolerance and pastoralism [47], we reasoned that the study of
lactase persistence mutations in Namibe might be informative for exploring historical links between southwestern
Bantu cattle herders and other pastoral communities elsewhere in Africa. To this end, we screened our sample for
all SNPs that are currently known to be associated with
lactase persistence in human populations. We found that
the -14010C allele, which is most frequent in Nilo-Saharan and Afro-Asiatic populations from Kenya and Tanzania (32–42%, [32]), was present at lower frequencies in
the Ovimbundu (1%), the Nyaneka-Nkhumbi (3%) and
the Kuvale (6%). By contrast, we could not find any
lactase persistence-associated allele in an additional sample of 111 individuals from several ethnolinguistic groups
in Mozambique.
Estimation of demographic parameters
Table 4 displays the estimated terms for the basic demographic parameters of the IM model using NRY and
mtDNA datasets from Southwest Angola and Southeast
Africa, assumed to represent the endpoints of the western
and eastern branches of the Bantu migrations, respectively
(see Additional file 6). Independent runs based on the
NRY dataset converged on the approximate marginal posterior probability distributions for all parameters of the

was found for the migration rate parameter from Southwest to Southeast Africa (m2, 2N2m2) under reasonable
computation times using the mtDNA dataset (see Additional file 11). Therefore, we chose to present separately
the outcome of individual runs with different probability
density peaks for this parameter (Table 4).

about one half that from the Southwest (N1~10000,
N2~5000; Table 4), while current population sizes estimated from the mtDNA data are similar in both edge populations (N1 and N2 ~30000; Table 4). Current population
sizes based on Y-chromosome estimates lie on the lower
range of reported African-specific population size, while
current population size estimates from the mtDNA are in
the upper range of reported values from African populations [49]. Ancestral population sizes inferred from the Ychromosome (NA~1200) and mtDNA (NA~7100) are also
different.

Estimated current population sizes (N1 and N2) are 4 to 8
fold higher than ancestral population sizes (NA) showing
that the dispersal of Bantu speaking groups involved both
significant size growth and geographic expansions. Population growth could actually have been even more
marked, if bottlenecks occurring at the formation of
daughter populations caused initial size reductions [48].
There are important differences in the estimates based in
the mtDNA and NRY datasets. The Y-chromosome-based
estimate for the current Southeast Africa population size is

With regard to migration, all Y-chromosome runs consistently yielded values close to zero (see Additional file 10),
corresponding to the first bin of the surveyed parameter
space (Table 4). In contrast, population migration rates
inferred from mtDNA are high (2N1m1 and 2N2m2 > 15;

In all cases, 2N2m2 estimates (migration from Southwest
into Southeast) were found to be consistently higher than
2N1m1 (migration from Southeast into Southwest), but
this observation must be regarded with caution, since
2N2m2 estimates from independent runs failed to converge to a single maximum (see Additional file 11).
Although the credibility intervals obtained in different
runs were quite similar, migration rate distributions were
typically two-peaked. While a fraction of the runs yielded
a major peak for lower 2N2m2 values (~35), in other cases
the pattern reversed and the major peak corresponded to
unusually high 22Nm2values (~180) (Table 4; Additional
file 11).
In order to overcome the limitations of single locus estimates, we have also generated inferences based on the
combined mtDNA and NRY datasets (Table 4; Additional
file 12). Joint estimates of population sizes support a 5fold growth after population splitting (N1and N2 ~7000;
NA~1300; Table 4). Divergence time estimates were
remarkably consistent with the archeological data (t =
4000 years; Table 4), while migration rates from the western to the eastern branch remained difficult to resolve,
reflecting the uncertainty associated with mtDNA dataset
(Table 4; Additional file 10).

Discussion
Southwest Angola in the African context
It is generally accepted that the mtDNA pool of Bantu
speaking populations comprises a diverse set of lineages
that trace their phylogeographical ancestry into three
major sub-continental regions: West Africa, East Africa
and West-Central Africa [6,11,24]. In spite of the growing
knowledge about the ultimate regional sources of Bantu
mtDNA lineages, the understanding of the major demographic processes that led to the assemblage and distribution of these diverse regional contributions among the
different areas of the Bantu-speaking universe is still far
from being complete. Our analysis shows that haplogroups currently associated with the Bantu mtDNA pool
from southwest Angola reflect the combination of different regional contributions generally observed in most
Bantu-speaking populations [6,11,24]. However, both the
patterns of lineage sharing and admixture estimates from
different potential source populations strongly suggest
that the bulk (~75%) of mtDNA variation in southwestern Angola can be traced back just to West-Central Africa,
in areas that are adjacent to the original heartland of
Bantu expansions [2]. The only additional region with a
significant (~13%) genetic contribution to Southwest
Angola was southern Africa, indicating that most extant
mtDNA variation from southwestern Angola may have
simply resulted from the encounter of an offshoot of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/80

West-Central Africa with autochthonous Khoisan-speaking peoples from the south.
It is, therefore, likely that the occupation of Southwest
Africa has been preceded by a period of assemblage of
diverse mtDNA contributions up north, in West-Central
Africa, followed by subsequent migrations from specific
dispersal centers into the southwest. According to linguistic and archeological evidences, a likely dispersal center to
Angola would have been located in savanna areas just
south of the equatorial forest, around the Tshikapa site,
where premetallurgical Bantu speakers originating in
Cameroon/Gabon might have acquired iron technology
and livestock from eastern Bantu peoples, before proceeding to the southwest [21,50]. The location of this center
on the southern savanna edge of West-Central Africa
would explain the lack of Pygmy L1c1a lineages in
Angola, in contrast with the areas closer to Cameroon and
Gabon where gene flow from Pygmies was more important [11].
In contrast with the collection of diverse haplogroups that
is generally found in the maternal pool, the NRY haplogroup composition is highly homogeneous in most
potential source areas of Bantu dispersions, due to the
predominance of haplogroup E3a-M2 in West and WestCentral Africa [8,9,51]. However, STR-defined haplotypes
yielded sufficient resolution to allow discrimination
between Y-chromosome contributions from West and
West-Central Africa and reveal a link between southwestern Angola and West-Central Africa that is remarkably
congruent with the results from the mtDNA dataset.
Southwest Angola in the local and regional contexts
Despite the substantial differences between their levels of
haplogroup variation, both NRY and mtDNA data concurred in showing that the populations sampled in
Namibe are clustered together with other Bantu groups
from elsewhere. Within the local context of southwestern
Angola, the divergence of the Herero-speaking Kuvale
from other population groups was found to be associated
with the lack of signals of demographic expansions (Table
1), suggesting that this differentiation was shaped by
increased genetic drift. Evidence for reduced levels of
mtDNA diversity that are likely to have been caused by
recent bottlenecks were previously described in Herero
populations from Namibia and Botswana, and seem to be
a pervasive feature of these groups [52,53]. However, it is
difficult to know to what extent the present diversity patterns reflect the traditional semi-nomadic pastoral way of
life of the Herero or were caused by population size reductions ensuing recent conflicts with colonial rulers [54-56].
Moreover, it is not clear whether genetic drift was sufficient to generate the divergence among Herero-speaking
groups that is evidenced by comparisons between the

Page 12 of 18
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:80

Kuvale from Angola and the Herero from Namibia, which
are believed to be the most representative population of
the group [17,56]. In fact, while our Kuvale sample is
essentially composed of mtDNA haplogroups that are
commonly found in other Bantu populations from
Angola (Figure 2 and Additional file 1), earlier data indicates that the Herero from Namibia display an unusually
high (~50%) frequency of haplogroup L3d [57,58], which
was not found in the Kuvale and is known to be much less
common in most Bantu populations [6]. This pattern may
imply that the broad Herero cultural division encompasses a very heterogeneous set of population groups with
no obvious common origin.
A further feature of the genetic composition of the Kuvale
that is not paralleled by the Herero from Namibia is their
substantial levels of assimilation of Khoe-San lineages
(Table 2). In fact, while Khoe-San lineages were absent in
sampled Y chromosomes from the Namibian Herero [59]
and may represent at most 8% of their mtDNA pool
[57,58], typical Khoe-San mtDNA L0d and NRY B2b haplogroups reached 22% and 12% frequencies, respectively,
in the Kuvale (Figures 2 and 4). Other sampled Bantu
groups from southern Angola that are not as cattle
dependent as the Kuvale exhibit much lower levels of
Khoe-San lineage assimilation (Figure 2, Table 2 and
Additional file 1), suggesting that most gene flow
occurred between the herding Khoe peoples and the herding Bantu, probably due to the similarity of their social
organization. Given the lack of shared haplotypes
between Namibe L0d and B2b haplotypes and the
sequences available in databases of Khoisan-speaking
populations, we have estimated the ages of the introgressed lineages in order to assess the time depth underlying their present differentiation. In spite of their large
uncertainty, coalescent estimates pointed to ages ranging
from 4816 (± 4816) to 29168 (± 20624) years, which consistently pre-date the expected arrival time of Bantu-speaking populations to southwestern Africa [1,2]. Thus, it is
likely that the divergence of these lineages occurred prior
to the recent Bantu expansion. In this context, it is tempting to speculate that the unmatched Angolan L0d and B2b
lineages may represent a legacy of the original speakers of

The presence in Namibe of the -14010C lactase persistence mutation, which had only been previously found in
Kenya and Tanzania [32], raises intriguing questions
about the relationships between the East and Southwest
African pastoral scenes. The simplest explanation for this
observation would be the occurrence of a direct link
between the two regions, leading to the introduction of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/80

the -14010C mutation in southwestern Angola, most
likely by incoming East Bantu migrants originating in East
Africa (Figure 6A). However, it is difficult to explain how
the -14010C mutation could have spread from a putative
Kenyan/Tanzanian center of origin into the remote areas
of southwestern Angola without reaching neighboring
regions in Mozambique, where no lactase persistence variants could be found. We thus favor an alternative hypothesis that takes into account the association between the
frequency of the -14010C variant, the levels of Khoe-San
lineage assimilation and the degree of dependence on pastoralism observed in the populations from southwestern
Angola (Figure 6). According to this interpretation, the 14010C allele could have been brought to southern Africa
by migrant Khoe cattle herders that had previously made
contact with Nilotic or Cushitic pastoralists from East
Africa. Subsequent interactions in southwestern Angola
would have transferred the mutation to Bantu herders
concomitantly with mtDNA and Y-chromosome lineages
that are specific of the Khoe-San. Under this framework, it
is conceivable that the first Bantu speakers arriving in
southern Angola acquired cattle only after contact with
the Khoe people. Three major lines of evidence support
the Khoe-San mediated transfer of the -14010C allele.
First, archeological, linguistic and ethnographic data suggest that herding Khoe peoples expanded into southern
Africa 2000 years ago from areas around the upper Zambezi River, where they may have acquired pottery and livestock from East African pastoralists spreading as far south
as Central Zambia [1,2,63]. Second, a recent analysis of
NRY lineages from southern and eastern Africa has
defined a new haplogroup (E3b1f), shared by Khoe-San
and non-Bantu East Africans, whose distribution is consistent with a Bantu-unrelated demic diffusion of pastoralism from East into southern Africa, which may have
started 2000 years ago [45]. Third, and as noted before
[32], early reports on lactose tolerance based in physiological tests indicate that Khoisan-speaking people may have
moderate levels of lactase persistence [64]. Future studies
of lactase persistence based on haplotype resolution of
flanking regions may shed light on the levels of genetic
differentiation between variants that are presently shared
by the compared populations.
The demography of Bantu expansions
We have attempted to infer basic demographic properties
of Bantu expansions using the framework of the IM model
by assuming that populations located in the southwestern
and southeastern edges of sub-equatorial Africa encompass the deepest branches of Bantu divergence after a common origin in West-Central Africa.

A major advantage of the IM class of models is the ability
to disentangle the effects of evolutionary factors that are
typically confounded in summary statistics based in equi-

librium models [19,20,48]. However, like other modelbased approaches, the IM framework relies on a number
of simplifying assumptions that may be violated by
empirical datasets. There are at least two assumptions that
may influence the validity of parameter estimates in the
context of the Bantu expansions. First, the model does not
take into account the effects of gene flow from third party
populations, whereas Bantu-speakers did undergo
regional interactions with local non-Bantu groups that
may distort the interpretation of inferred parameter values. Moreover, gene exchange involving unsampled
demes lying between the two edge populations may affect
inferences on the true patterns of migration, including the
degree of asymmetrical gene flow [65]. A second limiting
assumption is that the ancestral population is assumed to
be unstructured and to have persisted in isolation for a
long time before population splitting [66]. However the
patterns of mtDNA variation suggest that the Bantu
expansions might have been preceded by complex femalemediated population dynamics involving lineage assemblage in West-Central Africa and the formation of an
admixed ancestral population that had no time to achieve
panmixy before the expansion. It is possible that the

implausibly high divergence time inferred from our
mtDNA dataset (t~25000 years; Table 4) was influenced
by this kind of older population structure, reflecting lack
of panmixy in the ancestral population. In contrast, the
more consistent divergence time estimate inferred from
the Y-chromosome data (t~2000 years; Table 4) may be
related to the erasure of previous ancestral variation that
seems to have caused the current predominance of haplogroup E3a-M2, leading to a better fitting of the Y-chromosome data to the model. A further limitation lies in the
lack of a geographical specific framework accounting for
the spatial expansion of Bantu-speaking peoples.
In spite of these caveats, several consistent results could be
found, showing that the analyses presented here do provide informative parameter estimates that may be contrasted in the future with other inferential frameworks and
empirical datasets. Our joint estimation of the time of
split between the two edges of Bantu migrations (t~4000
years; Table 4), inferred from clearly resolved posterior
density peaks, is remarkably consistent with archeologybased estimates for the onset of the dispersion of Bantu
speaking peoples across Africa [1,2]. On the other hand,

comparisons between estimates based on the NRY and
mtDNA data reveal clearly contrasting patterns between
the historic demographic parameters of male and females
that may account for key present-day properties of Bantu
genetic variation.
Previous comparative studies on Y-chromosome and
mtDNA variation in Africa provided evidence for sex
biased demographic patterns, including the observation
of different levels of correlation between genetic, linguistic and geographic variation [59], as well as the finding
that interpopulation differentiation measured by Fst estimators is higher for the Y-chromosome than for the
mtDNA in food-producing societies [67]. The latter pattern was interpreted as the result of higher migration rates
and/or effective sizes in females than in males. More
recently, a resequencing study of mtDNA and Y-chromosome stretches, performed in the same set of sub-Saharan
African populations, has found that signals of population
expansion in food-producing populations, including one
combined Bantu sample, were limited to the mtDNA,
while Y-chromosome data better fit models of population
stationarity [68]. We found evidence for a demographic
expansion both using the Y-chromosome and the mtDNA
datasets (Table 4). However, since we used a different
inferential framework, a different set of populations and
distinct types of genetic information, it is difficult to evaluate the causes of this discrepancy. In any case, our inferences based on the IM model seem to confirm and extend
the previous trends by showing that expanding Bantu
females most likely had both greater population sizes (N)
and higher migration rates (m) (Table 4).
As previously proposed [67,68], it is likely that cultural
practices like polygyny, leading to a lower male effective
size, and patrilocality, leading to a higher female migration rate, were the major driving forces underlying the
observed patterns of genetic variation in current Bantu
speaking populations. However, it is important to stress
that differences in migration rates among Bantu populations do not necessarily imply differences in the ability to
advance and settle new territory. Thus, the higher mobility
of females does not mean that males advanced slower
than females during the range expansion of Bantu populations, but simply that females were more likely to
migrate across the different settlements that were progressively established as the Bantu dispersions unfolded.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/80

ples out of the rain forests was preceded by the assemblage
of diverse mtDNA contributions in West-Central Africa, a
process that was not paralleled by the Y-chromosome, in
which lineage extinction must have prevailed. Estimates
of demographic parameters have shown that contrasting
patterns of female and male genetic variation were a pervasive feature of Bantu expansions, characterized by lower
male than female effective sizes and migration rates. Local
interactions between the western vanguard of the Bantu
migrations and Khoisan-speaking peoples from the arid
regions of the South were essentially mediated by Bantu
pastoral peoples like the Herero-speaking Kuvale, who
share aspects of their social organization with Khoe cattle
herders from adjacent areas. We hypothesize that the East
African lactase persistence -14010C mutation has been
carried to southern Africa by Khoe herders who contacted
East African pastoralists and subsequently transferred the
mutation to Bantu cattle herders in the course of genetic
interactions in the Southwest.

Conclusion
Based on patterns of lineage sharing and admixture estimates, our analysis provides evidence that most genetic
variation from southwestern Angola is likely to have
derived from West-Central Africa. The differences in the
amount of haplogroup variation between the mtDNA and
Y-chromosome data suggest that the push of Bantu peo-
