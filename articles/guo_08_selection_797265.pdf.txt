Abstract
Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) posttranscriptionally down-regulate gene expression by
binding target mRNAs. Analysis of the evolution of miRNA binding sites is helpful in understanding
the co-evolution between miRNAs and their targets. To understand this process in plants a
comparative analysis of miRNA-targeted duplicated gene pairs derived from a well-documented
whole genome duplication (WGD) event in combination with a population genetics study of six
experimentally validated miRNA binding sites in rice (O. sativa) was carried out.
Results: Of the 1,331 pairs of duplicate genes from the WGD, 41 genes (29 pairs) were
computationally predicted to be miRNA targets. Sequence substitution analysis indicated that the
synonymous substitution rate was significantly lower in the miRNA binding sites than their 5' and
3' flanking regions. Of the 29 duplicated gene pairs, 17 have only one paralog been targeted by a
miRNA. This could be due to either gain of a miRNA binding site after the WGD or because one
of the duplicated genes has escaped from being a miRNA target after the WGD (loss of miRNA
binding site). These possibilities were distinguished by separating miRNAs conserved in both dicots
and monocot plants from rice-specific miRNAs and by phylogenetic analysis of miRNA target gene
families. The gain/loss rate of miRNA binding sites was estimated to be 3.0 × 10-9 gain/loss per year.
Most (70.6%) of the gains/losses were due to nucleotide mutation. By analysis of cultivated (O.
sativa; n = 30) and wild (O. rufipogon; n = 15) rice populations, no segregating site was observed in
six miRNA binding sites whereas 0.12–0.20 SNPs per 21-nt or 1.53–1.80 × 10-3 of the average
pairwise nucleotide diversity (π) were found in their flanking regions.
Conclusion: Both molecular evolution and population genetics support the hypothesis that
conservation of miRNA binding sites is maintained by purifying selection through elimination of
deleterious alleles. Nucleotide mutations play a major role in the gain/loss of miRNA binding sites
during evolution.

Background
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenously encoded small
RNAs that play important roles in regulation of gene
expression in animals and plants. The majority of known
mature miRNAs are about 20–24 nucleotides long and
have been identified in a wide range of eukaryotes, such as
fruit fly, nematode, zebrafish, chicken, mouse, human,
Arabidopsis, maize and rice (reviewed by Bartel [1]). In
rice, at least 76 miRNA families consisting of 269 members have been reported (miRBase, Release 11.0, http://
microrna.sanger.ac.uk; [2]) and recently, another 39 new
miRNA families have been identified from developing rice
grains [3]. Identification of target genes is an essential step
in determining the biological functions of miRNAs. Since
plant miRNAs recognize their target mRNAs by near-perfect base pairing, computational sequence similarity
searches can be used to identify potential targets [4-7].

An ancient polyploid origin of the rice genome has been
well documented [16-20]. The whole genome duplication
(WGD) event occurred ~70 million years ago, predating
the divergence of cereals (50 million years ago; [21]) from
their common ancestor, but postdating the moncot-dicot
divergence (~200 million years ago; [22]).
In this study, the evolutionary pattern of miRNA binding
sites in rice was investigated using two different
approaches (see Figure 1 for the flow chart): a molecular
evolutionary investigation based on WGD paralogs targeted by known rice miRNAs and a population genetics
investigation of six experimentally validated miRNA binding sites. Both investigations revealed a highly conserved
miRNA binding site and strong evolutionary selection on
miRNA binding sites in rice.

Results and discussion
Selective constraint is defined as the factor by which evolutionary divergence of a functional sequence is reduced
due to the action of purifying selection [8]. The basis of
the estimation of selective constraint is the comparison of
the relative divergence of putatively constrained segments
of the genome with that of linked, putatively neutrally
evolving sequences. By comparing homologous segments,
nucleotide and/or insertion/deletion substitutions are
assumed to fall into two classes: neutral, evolving at the
same rate as the neutral sequence; or strongly constrained,
in which mutations are eliminated unconditionally by
natural selection. It is assumed that homologous segments that show significant similarity are under strong
selective constraints, while other sequences lacking similarity are evolving free from selective constraints. Based on
this assumption, several methods for estimation of selective constraint have been proposed and applied to the
coding and non-coding DNAs in invertebrates and mammals (e.g. [9-11]). By comparing recent segmentally
duplicated genes we found that strong purifying selection
applies to non-coding sequences in rice [12]. Selective
constraint has also been detected based on population
genetics data from SNP projects in human [9,13,14]. An
evolutionary model has been proposed which hypothesises that deleterious SNPs can be observed in nature but
most of them will be prevented from reaching a high frequency or going on to be fixed [13]. Thus, regions under
purifying selection should have less segregating sites compared with the linked neutral site, which can tolerate deleterious mutations. For example, analysis of the
distribution of fitness effects on new mutations in the
conserved non-coding sequences in mammals has
revealed weak purifying selection [15], whereas in
humans, purifying selection is stronger in the conserved
miRNA binding sites than in other conserved sequence
motifs in the 3' UTRs [13].

Prediction of miRNA targets located on WGD genes
At least nine duplicated blocks from an ancient WGD with
retained syntenic duplicate gene copies have been
reported [16-20]. A total of 1,331 paralogous gene pairs
(Additional file 1) derived from the WGD that occurred
~70 million years ago (mya) was determined following
the methods of Guo et al. [12] and Lin et al. [23] from the
51,369 annotated non-transposable element-related rice
genes (TIGR Release 5; Figure 1). One hundred and fourteen rice miRNA families, including 76 from miRBase
(Release 11.0, http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk; the predicted
miRNAs miR413-420 and miR426 were not included)
and 39 newly identified miRNA families [3] were used to
predict target genes located on the 1,331 duplicated gene
pairs following the method of Rhoades et al. [4] and
Schwab et al. [7], which are based on additive, positiondependent mismatch pair penalties. A total of 29 gene
pairs from the 1,331 duplicated gene pairs were predicted
(see Methods). Of the 29 pairs, 17 have a miRNA binding
site on only one of the two duplicated paralogs (Additional file 2) and other 12 have the same miRNA binding
site on both duplicated paralogs (Additional file 3). The
29 gene pairs were used for subsequent analysis.

To estimate the accuracy of the predicted miRNA binding
sites in the 29 gene pairs or 41 genes, a comparison
between the miRNA dataset and a random dataset was carried out using the method developed by Rhoades et al. [4].
For each authentic miRNA, ten cohorts with randomly
permuted sequences that had identical sizes and compositions as the authentic miRNAs were constructed. Using
the same prediction method for the authentic miRNA, its
ten cohorts were searched for complementary sites within
the WGD genes using the PatScan program under the
same empirical parameters. The result indicated that substantially more complementary sites were found for the
authentic miRNA than for its randomized sequences

to analyze a selection of the miRNA target genes and the gain or loss of miRNA binding sites. a: the rice genome annotation by
the TIGR; b: empirical parameters: no mismatch at positions 10 and 11; no more than one mismatch at positions 2–12; no
more than two consecutive mismatches downstream of position 13; c: 76 miRNAs from miRBase (Release 11.0, http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk) and 38 newly identified miRNAs [3]; d: see Additional file 8; e: see Additional file 4.

(3.1:48, false positive rate = 0.061). The result suggests
that most of the predicted complementary sites should be
authentic targets of miRNAs. The predicted miRNA target
genes were grouped into functional categories (TIGR GO

annotation) and it was found that transcription factors
(41%) are the most abundant target genes. These results
suggest that the predicted miRNA target genes provide a
reliable dataset for the following analysis.

non-binding regions, nucleotide polymorphisms of six
experimentally validated miRNA target genes (Additional
file 4) were investigated in the cultivated and wild rice
populations. Genomic fragments of 650–850-bp containing the binding sites of the miRNAs (miR156::Os08g398
90, miR159::Os01g59600, miR390::Os02g10100, miR39
5::Os03g09930, miR408::Os03g15340 and miR820a::Os
03g02010) were amplified and sequenced (Accession nos.
EU382760–EU382980). It was found that the SNP density was significantly constrained in the miRNA binding
sites compared to their flanking regions in all target genes
of the six miRNAs (Table 2). For example, we failed to
detect any segregating site in the miRNA binding sites
while 9.31 SNPs/kb or 0.20 SNPs/21-nt, and 5.59 SNPs/
kb or 0.12 SNPs/21-nt were found at the 5' and 3' flanking
regions, respectively. The average nucleotide diversity (π)
of the miRNA binding sites (0) is lower than those of their
flanking regions (1.53–1.80×10-3) in both the cultivated
and wild rice populations (Table 2; Additional file 5), suggesting a stronger selection on the miRNA binding sites, a
result consistent with that observed in our analysis of
duplicated genes. Our results also suggest that the purifying selection is still dominates in cultivated population of
rice even although rice has undergone recent strong
domestication selection.

Selection on microRNA binding sites
Evolutionary changes to miRNA binding sites in rice were
investigated through approaches of molecular evolution
using the well documented genome duplicated gene pairs
targeted by known rice miRNAs and population genetics
using a wide range of cultivated and wild rice accessions,
respectively (Figure 1).

To detect selection pressure in the regions containing the
miRNA binding sites, we divided a miRNA target gene
into three parts: the miRNA binding site, its 5' and 3'
flanking regions. For each region, the synonymous (Ks)
and non-synonymous (Ka) substitution rates between the
two duplicated genes of the 29 gene pairs were estimated.
It was found that the Ks in the miRNA binding site and its
5' and 3' flanking regions were 0.209, 1.329 and 1.772,
respectively (Table 1). A significant reduction in synonymous nucleotide substitute rate was detected in the
miRNA binding site compared with its 5' or 3' flanking
region (non-parametric Wilcoxon test:
V = 403, p-value = 5.533e-06 and V = 406, p-value =
3.995e-06 for the 5' and 3' flanking regions of the miRNA
binding site, respectively). A similar result was also
observed for the non-synonymous nucleotide substitution rate. These results suggest that the miRNA binding
site is more conserved than the regions flanking it; hence
there is a stronger selection on the miRNA binding sites
than on regions surrounding the miRNA target sites during co-evolution of miRNAs and their target genes. The
ratio of Ka/Ks is usually used to characterize selective evolution of sequences: Ka/Ks ratios of less than 0.25 indicate
purifying selection, values of 1 suggest neutral evolution,
and values greater than 1 indicate positive selection [24].
Apparently, purifying selection was observed in rice
miRNA target sites and their nearby flanking regions
(Table 1). It should be noted that the false positive rate of
9.2% for the predicted miRNA target sites could weaken
but not bias our results, because the selection pressure on
the falsely predicted miRNA binding sites is expected to be
same as that on their flanking regions

Polymorphism data are generally only informative for
weak selective effects in recent evolution (such as in the
rice lineage), whereas divergence data are potentially
informative for stronger selective effects and more distant
evolutionary events (e.g. ~70 mya) [13]. From divergence
data, we have found the presence of an extensive silent
nucleotide reduction within miRNA binding sites compared with their flanking regions. SNP density in the
miRNA binding sites was also lower than that in their
flanking regions. Both of the results strongly suggest that
purifying selection played a major role in maintenance of
the conservation of miRNA binding regions to meet the
requirement of miRNA-target base pairing for target recognition in the binding regions. The same situation of purifying selection on miRNA binding sites via a population
genetics investigation was also reported in natural Arabidopsis population recently [25]. Additionally, conservation of miRNA target sites between distantly related plant
species has been suggested in previous studies [26-28].

Population genetics is a useful tool to detect the evolutionary selection on miRNA target loci [13]. To test
whether nucleotide polymorphism frequency in the
miRNA binding sites differs significantly from that in the

The gain and loss of miRNA-target interaction sites
The gain and loss of miRNA-target interaction sites are
two important processes during co-evolution of a miRNA
and its target(s). The duplicated genes from the WGD provide an opportunity to study the gain/loss dynamics of
miRNA binding sites after a duplication event in rice. As
mentioned above, of the 29 duplicated gene pairs harbouring miRNA binding sites, 12 pairs have miRNA binding sites on both paralogs, indicating that these genes
most likely had been regulated by miRNAs or gained their
miRNA binding sites before the WGD and that their
miRNA binding sites were maintained after the WGD. For
the remaining 17 WGD gene pairs only one paralog of the
pair is targeted by a miRNA, indicating a gain or loss of
miRNA target or a gain of miRNA itself after the WGD
event. For a given miRNA, no matter its interaction with
target genes predated divergence of dicots and monocots
or after the divergence of dicots and monocots but predating the rice WGD event, if all of its target genes belong to
a gene family and some family members do not have
miRNA binding sites, this would be evidence for loss of a
miRNA binding site after the WGD event, whereas a
miRNA binding site on only a single gene of a gene family
might indicate an acquisition of miRNA function through

gain of miRNA binding site (for the existing miRNAs) or
evolving of a new miRNA after the WGD event.
All these scenarios were evident in our analysis. miR397 is
conserved in dicots and targets L-ascorbate oxidase precursors [29]. Phylogenetic analysis of the target gene family (TIGR ID 3735), with their orthologs from Arabidopsis
and pinus as outgroups, indicated that interactions
between miR397 and its targets predated the WGD (Figure 2; Additional file 6). At least four genes of two pairs
(Os05g38390/Os01g62600
and
Os01g62480/
Os05g38420) were derived from the WGD (Additional
file 1, 2, 3). There is only one mismatch at position 3
between miR397 and its binding site in Os05g38420
which has been experimentally validated target of miR397
[29], while up to five mismatches are present in the potential miR397 binding site of Os01g62600, which was not a
target based on our prediction criteria (Figure 2B). The
result suggests that the WGD paralog Os01g62600 has
most likely lost its interaction with miR397 or escaped
from the control of miR397 after the WGD.
miR156 and miR535 are all conserved in dicots and were
predicted to target only one member of their respective

target gene families (Additional file 6), suggesting potential gains of binding sites after the WGD. As an example,
the putative gain of miR535 binding site was shown in
Additional file 7. No sequence similarity was observed
between the new target families and the ancestral targets
of the conserved miRNAs, indicating they are independent of each other in phylogenetic relationship. This
implies gain of a target site via a mechanism not involving
inverted repeat derived miRNA/target pair formation [30].
Fahlgren et al. [31] identified recent MIRNA loci by comparing similarity between MIRNA foldback arms and protein-coding genes. No evidence can be found to support
the origin of those conserved miRNAs from their new target families using the method of Fahlgren et al. [31].
Above observations suggest the idea of gain of a target site
unrelated to the ancestral ones of the miRNA, a mechanism that is not reported yet. In our data set, all rice-specific miRNAs were predicted to target only one WGD
paralog in a single gene family (Additional file 6), which
clearly indicate that both miRNAs and their targets arose
after the WGD.
The gain or loss rate of the miRNA-target interaction sites
after the genome duplication event in rice was estimated.
Allowing p to be the proportion of gain/loss of the miRNA
binding sites between the duplicated genes, we have p =
17/(12 × 2 + 17) = 0.415, where 17 is the gain or loss
number of the miRNA binding sites, 12 × 2 is the number
of conserved miRNA binding sites in two paralogs (Figure
1). Then the expected gain or loss rate of the miRNA binding site can be estimated as the following:

μ = p/2t = 0.415/(2 × 70 × 106) = 3.0 × 10-9 gain/loss per
year, where t = 70 million years
In rice, Lin et al. [23] estimated that the gain/loss rate of
introns is 3.61 × 10-10 per intron per year. A similar gain/
loss rate of introns in Arabidopsis, 2–3 × 10-10~12, has also
been reported [32]. Compared with the rate of introns, the
gain/loss rate of miRNA binding sites in rice is at least one
order higher. It seems to be that relatively long sequences
and a complex mechanism might be involved in gene
structure evolution. Therefore, it should be more difficult
to change a gene structure than a miRNA binding site.
In order to determine the potential mechanisms for the
gain/loss of miRNA binding sites, we further investigated
and checked the alignments of binding regions in the 17
WGD gene pairs. No gap was found in alignments of 12
(70.6%) gene pairs, suggesting that nucleotide mutation
was the main evolutionary force in the gain/loss of
miRNA binding sites. Our results indicated that nucleotide mutations together with insertions/deletions are
responsible for the gain/loss of miRNA binding sites during co-evolution of miRNAs and their target genes.

Conclusion
Investigations of both the molecular evolution of WDG
gene pairs and population genetics of wild and cultivated
rice indicate that pervasive purifying selection might be
the major selection constraint for maintenance of the conserved interaction between miRNAs and their binding
sites in rice. Our results also revealed that these interactions is a dynamic process because some conserved miRNAs lost their putative target genes derived from the WGD
and some conserved miRNAs acquired new target genes,
which are usually unrelated to those ancestral targets, after
the WGD. The gain/loss rate was estimated to be 3.0 × 109 gain/loss per year, with nucleotide mutations playing a
major role in the gain/loss of miRNA target sites during
evolution.

Methods
Plant materials
Forty-five Oryza accessions were selected from a wide
range of geographical locations to represent a broad range
of the genetic diversity within cultivated rice (O. sativa)
and its wild ancestor, O. rufipogon. Detailed information
of the 30 domesticated lines (15 indica and 15 japonica
cultivars) and 15 wild lines, which were provided by International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) or China Rice
Research Institute, is shown in Additional file 8.
PCR and DNA sequencing
To investigate sequence variation in the miRNA-targeted
protein-coding genes among the selected rice lines, a 650–
850 bp genomic fragment that covers the miRNA binding
site was amplified from each accession. Primers (Additional file 4) were designed based on the genomic
sequence of japonica cultivar Nipponbare using Primer3
[33]. The primers were compared to the rice genome
sequence to ensure their specificity. Genomic DNA was
extracted from fresh rice leaves using a cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) protocol [34]. PCR reactions
were carried out on a thermocycler (Eppendorf) under the
following conditions: 95°C for 5 min, followed by 35
cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 53°C
for 30 s and extension at 72°C for 90 s, with a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. PCR products were visualized on
0.8% agarose gel. A product of expected size was amplified from each sample. The amplified products were purified using glassmilk PCR purification kits (BioDev-Tech,
China). Purified PCR products were first directly
sequenced from both ends using the forward and reverse
primer. The PCR products that were failed in direct
sequencing were cloned into pGEM-T Easy Vector
(TaKaRa) and at least three independent clones were
sequenced. Total about 500 PCR products were successfully amplified and sequenced. All sequences have been
deposited into GenBank with accession numbers
EU382760–EU382980.

Identification of the genomic duplicated gene pairs
A total of 51,369 non-transposable element-related rice
protein sequences (Release 5) were downloaded from the
Rice Genome Annotation of TIGR (The Institute of
Genomic Research, http://www.tigr.org). Whole genome
duplicated gene pairs were identified using a reciprocal
BLASTP [35] search with E-value less than 1e-14 within a
distance of 200 kb between collinear gene pairs [12,23].
The dataset containing 285 duplicated gene pairs from
chromosomes 11 and 12, which were resulted from a
recent duplication about 7 million years ago [36], was
excluded. The final dataset contains 1,331 gene pairs
(Additional file 1) derived from the WGD.
Prediction of miRNA binding sites on the duplicated gene
pairs
In total, 114 rice miRNA families, 76 (not including
miR413-420 and miR426 predicted based on similarities
to the predicted Arabidopsis miRNAs) from miRBase
(Release 11.0, http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk; [3]) and 39
newly identified miRNA families [3] were used to predict
miRNA targets using PatScan [37] on the 1,331 duplicated
gene pairs or 2,662 genes following the method of
Rhoades et al. [4] and Schwab et al. [7]. G:U and other
noncanonical pairs were treated as mismatches. Empirical
parameters used in this study: no mismatch at positions
10 and 11; no more than one mismatch at positions 2–12;
no more than two consecutive mismatches downstream
of position 13. The cut-off vale 4.0 was used. Finally, a set
of 29 WGD gene pairs, 17 with miRNA binding sites predicted on only one paralog of the gene pair (Additional
file 2) and 12 with miRNA binding sites predicted on both
paralogs of the gene pair (Additional file 3) were retained
and used for further analysis (Figure 1). As a control, complementary sites were also predicted for 10 cohorts that
had identical sizes and base compositions to the miRNAs
used but their sequences were randomly permuted.
Sequence substitution, divergence and phylogenetic
analysis
Two protein sequences of each gene pair were aligned
using the global sequence alignment program NEEDLE in
the EMBOSS package [38]. The alignment result was used
to guide the alignment of their corresponding nucleotide
sequences, and gaps in the alignment were trimmed. Each
gene was then divided into three portions: the 5' flanking
region, the miRNA binding site and the 3' flanking region.
To detect sequence divergence of each parts in each gene
pair, we estimated synonymous (Ks) and non-synonymous (Ka) substitution rates by using the Yang-Nielson
maximum-likelihood method, implemented in the YN00
program of the PAML package [39]. Synonymous sites
considered to be of saturation (Ks > 5.0) were discarded.

Clustal W [40] was used to align multiple sequences for
the construction of phylogenetic trees. Neighbor-joining
phylogenies based on the Kimura 2-parameter distance
matrix were generated by MEGA version 3.1 [41]. Bootstrap confidence values were obtained by 1000 replicates
and were shown. The determination of other family members of miRNA-targeted genes followed the TIGR' annotation ftp://ftp.tigr.org/. Watterson's estimator of θ [42] and
the average pairwise nucleotide diversity π [43] were estimated using DNASP version 4.10.2 [44].
