Abstract
Background: G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute a large family of integral
transmembrane receptor proteins that play a central role in signal transduction in eukaryotes. The
genome of the protochordate Ciona intestinalis has a compact size with an ancestral complement of
many diversified gene families of vertebrates and is a good model system for studying
protochordate to vertebrate diversification. An analysis of the Ciona repertoire of GPCRs from a
comparative genomic perspective provides insight into the evolutionary origins of the GPCR
signalling system in vertebrates.
Results: We have identified 169 gene products in the Ciona genome that code for putative GPCRs.
Phylogenetic analyses reveal that Ciona GPCRs have homologous representatives from the five
major GRAFS (Glutamate, Rhodopsin, Adhesion, Frizzled and Secretin) families concomitant with other
vertebrate GPCR repertoires. Nearly 39% of Ciona GPCRs have unambiguous orthologs of
vertebrate GPCR families, as defined for the human, mouse, puffer fish and chicken genomes. The
Rhodopsin family accounts for ~68% of the Ciona GPCR repertoire wherein the LGR-like subfamily
exhibits a lineage specific gene expansion of a group of receptors that possess a novel domain
organisation hitherto unobserved in metazoan genomes.
Conclusion: Comparison of GPCRs in Ciona to that in human reveals a high level of orthology of
a protochordate repertoire with that of vertebrate GPCRs. Our studies suggest that the ascidians
contain the basic ancestral complement of vertebrate GPCR genes. This is evident at the subfamily
level comparisons since Ciona GPCR sequences are significantly analogous to vertebrate GPCR
subfamilies even while exhibiting Ciona specific genes. Our analysis provides a framework to
perform future experimental and comparative studies to understand the roles of the ancestral
chordate versions of GPCRs that predated the divergence of the urochordates and the vertebrates.

Background
On a taxonomic and phylogenetic scale, Ciona intestinalis
is a protochordate belonging to the ascidian class of urochordates that diverged from a lineage leading to the vertebrates approximately 520 million years ago [1]. This

extant ascidian occupies a crucial place in the "Tree of life"
as an out-group to the vertebrates and hence studies
addressing evolutionary aspects of Ciona have the potential to offer insight into some of the most intriguing questions about the origin of the vertebrates from a chordate

lineage. Recent genomic analysis has shown that the urochordates, and not cephalochordates, are the closest
extant relatives of vertebrates [2]. As an added advantage,
this ascidan is also amenable to experimentation and even
has a century old history of being used for embryological
studies [3]. A translucent morphology, availability of
developmental mutants, established transgenic experimental procedures, EST databases and quickly spawning
embryos are just a few advantages that make Ciona a
favourite model system for developmental biologists.
Ciona has a compact genome size of about 160 million
base pairs and contains approximately 16,000 proteincoding genes [4].
GPCR based signal transduction is ubiquitous in eukaryotic genomes and forms the basis of detection of diverse
environmental cues such as odorant molecules, amines,
peptides, lipids, nucleotides and photons. A common
structural feature of GPCRs is the presence of a highly conserved architecture of seven stretches of transmembrane
spanning residues linked by alternate extracellular and
intracellular loops. The diversity among GPCRs primarily
stem from the presence of characteristic N-terminal extracellular domains and C-terminal intracellular domains
and to a relatively lesser extent from the connecting loops
which share limited sequence similarity. A number of
fully sequenced genomes have been mined for their repertoire of GPCRs and comparative phylogenetic studies
described for Homo sapiens [5], Tetraodon nigrovirdis [6],
Anopheles gambiae [7], Gallus gallus [8], Rattus rattus [9],
Mus musculus [10], Drosophila melanogaster [11] and Branchiostoma floridae [12].
On the basis of a large scale phylogenetic analysis, GPCRs
in human and subsequently in many other genomes have
been classified into five major families (GRAFS);Glutamate (G), Rhodopsin (R), Adhesion (A), Frizzled/Smoothened
(F), and Secretin (S) [5,6,8-12]. We denote the family
names in italic with an initial capital letter to avoid possible confusion with for example, the rhodopsin receptor.
HMMs (Hidden Markov Models) derived from the GRAFS
classification system, along with the HMMs of other nonGRAFS families of GPCRs have been used to tract putative
GPCRs from 13 completely sequenced genomes (including Ciona) into specific families and subfamilies. The
analysis revealed that GRAFS families can be found in all
bilateral species suggesting that they arose before the split
of nematodes from the chordate lineage [13]. A recent
review details progress in mining the gene repertoire and
expressed sequence tags (ESTs) for GPCRs in several completed genomes [14].
The Ciona genome provides scope for identification of
GPCRs that are analogous in function to its vertebrate
counterparts. This provides a resource for comparative

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/129

analysis aimed at assigning function to putative gene
products [15]. Furthermore, comparative protein domain
analysis as implemented in evolutionary trace methods
can identify functional interface residues essential for ligand binding and subsequent signalling events [16]. Identification of conserved domains and/or novel GPCRs and
their ligands are of major interest in light of the well-recognized roles of GPCRs in clinical medicine [17-19]. Furthermore, the repertoire of GPCRs in Ciona could provide
insights into some of the intriguing questions in evolutionary biology about the origins and evolution of the
GPCR signalling system in a protochordate and its further
diversification into the vertebrate lineage. Ciona possesses
organ systems are homologous to vertebrate heart, thyroid, notochord and pineal systems [20,21]. Our comparative genomic analysis could now serve as a basis for
carrying out molecular genetic studies in Ciona to address
many functional and regulatory aspects of GPCR associated vertebrate organ development and physiology.
Finally, it is also important to note that such genome-wide
comparisons may provide some wrong conclusions about
orthologous relationships in individual cases and results
from such analysis are best used as complementary tools
for carrying out specific experimental studies.
Here, we describe the repertoire of GPCRs in the Ciona
intestinalis genome and provide a comparative perspective
to the GRAFS families, including a detailed analysis of the
LDLRR-GPCR (Low-density lipo-protein receptor repeat
containing GPCR) family in Ciona.

Results
Our aim was to generate an independent data set of the
repertoire of Ciona GPCRs and thereupon, using phylogenetic approaches provide a comparative genomic perspective of the salient features observed in the repertoire. In
order to generate the complete set of putative GPCRs, we
adopted a comprehensive strategy wherein predicted 6/7/
8 transmembrane receptor sequences identified from the
JGI (Joint Genome Institute, USA) Ciona proteome was
subjected to an array of similarity and pattern search analysis for GPCR specific features. The hits from these search
methods were further subjected to phylogenetic analyses
(Figure 1). Such a process identified 169 putative GPCRs
that represent ~1.1 % of the total number of gene products predicted from the Ciona genome. The proportion of
GPCRs to the genome size is therefore comparable to
those predicted in vertebrate and insect genomes [13]. To
the best of our knowledge, manual searches revealed only
30 unique Ciona GPCR sequences to be present in the current updated public sequence repositories. The Ciona
GPCRs identified are summarized in Table 1 and Table 2.
The complete list of Ciona GPCR sequences identified
through this study is available as Additional data file 1.

sequences and the hits were taken for comparison against GPCRDB and against customized HMMs and PSSMs of GPCR families/subfamilies using an array of similarity/pattern search tools like BLASTP, HMMPFAM and RPS-BLAST. Subsequently, a
number of phylogenetic analyses were performed on the sequences identified as putative GPCRs.

HMM based genome-wide GPCR surveys have been previously carried out in 13 genomes, including that of Ciona
[13]. While this HMM based study provided a broad overview of the repertoire of GPCRs in the Ciona genome, an
independent large-scale molecular phylogenetic treatment with respect to the tunicate GPCRs has not emerged
and awaits investigation. GPCR features reflecting highly
specialized ascidian specific biology are usually evident
from such phylogenetic analysis. Of particular interest are
whole-genome orthology and paralogy comparisons that
are not evident from the previous HMM based search
approach [13]. A table describing orthology and paralogy
observations identified in Ciona GPCRs through our comparative genomic studies is provided [Additional data file
2: sheet 1]. Our phylogenetic study also provides the first
ever insight into Ciona specific protochordate GPCR repertoire apart from vindicating the presence of the five
major GRAFS families (Figure 2). Homologs of the chemosensory GPCRs from nematodes, plant GPCRs, Yeast
Pheromone receptors, gustatory and olfactory receptors
from insects were not identified. 66 clear orthologs of
human GPCRs could be identified in Ciona based on phylogenetic analysis.
Since EST evidence covers three quarters of the predicted
Ciona genes, we also identified EST matches for the 169
putative GPCRs using TBLASTN with a stringent cut off E-

value of 1e-15. Except for 12 of the 169 sequences, the rest
of the GPCRs had at least one EST match. EST matches for
these receptors were sorted as being derived from different
developmental stages including fertilized egg, tailbud
embryo, larval, embryo, gastrula and neurula, cleavage/
cleaving stage, Stage 3, directional larva, young adult,
juvenile and mature adult stage as well as adult tissues like
heart, neural complex, gonad, digestive, blood/haemocytes, endostyle and testis [Additional data file 2: sheet 2].
A preliminary observation from the EST table also showed
that as many as 133 receptors had at least one match that
could be recovered in the ten different developmental
stages of Ciona at the cut off E-value of 10-15, suggestive of
a role for these GPCRs in developmental processes.
The Rhodopsin Family (116 members)
The Rhodopsin family in Ciona includes 116 receptors that
constitute about 68% of the entire GPCR repertoire. The
Rhodopsin family has analogous subfamily level representatives among the four main groups, termed α-, β-, γ-, and
δ-group, which in turn are subdivided into 13 major subfamilies in humans [5]. At the individual gene level, 39
out of the 116 Rhodopsin receptors display a clear human
ortholog. However, unlike in the human Rhodopsin family, distinct clustering into the four major groups was not
observed in Ciona. This is only expected since it is known

Our large-scale phylogenetic analysis of Ciona Rhodopsin
family with annotated receptors from other genomes
revealed the presence of 9 of the 13 subfamilies described
for the human Rhodopsin family (Figure 3). One noteworthy finding in the Ciona Rhodopsin repertoire is the identification of an innovative low-density lipoprotein receptor
repeat containing GPCR cluster (LDLRR-GPCR). The
LDLRR-GPCRs, the Ciona LGR-like sequences (Leucine
rich repeat containing GPCRs) and the GLHRs (Glycoprotein hormone receptor) clustered into one main branch
with a high bootstrap support (999 out of 1000 NJ trees)
(Figure 3). For the sake of clarity in discussions, the Rhodopsin phylogenetic representation is split into two sub-

sets, one comprising the LDLRR-GPCR/LGR-like set of
receptors and the other consisting of the non-(LDLRRGPCR/LGR-like) cluster. Among the non-(LDLRR-GPCR/
LGR-like) set of sequences, the melanocortin receptors of
the α-group, the classical chemokine receptors (CCRs,
CXCRs), melanocyte-concentrating hormone (MCHR)
subfamilies of the γ-group and the purine (PUR), MASrelated receptor (MRG) and olfactory subfamilies of the δgroup are conspicuously absent. As many as 23 receptors
could not be included in any subfamily with significant
phylogenetic support. These sequences were thus designated as "Other Rhodopsins". Rhodopsin subfamily members that could not be annotated at the individual gene
level due to lack of support via cross-genome phylogenetic
clustering were deemed as "Unclassified Rhodopsins". The
"Unclassified Rhodopsins" are different from the "Other Rhodopsins" in that most of these "Unclassified Rhodopsins"
could be included into individual Rhodopsin subfamilies
when analyzed with limited number of sequences, but in
a larger data set do not give stable or consistent topology.

Phylogenetic relationship between GPCRs in Ciona and other genomes
Phylogenetic relationship between GPCRs in Ciona and other genomes. The figure illustrates the presence of representatives of Glutamate, Rhodopsin, Adhesion, Frizzled, and Secretin family members in Ciona. Two sequences that are homologous to cAMP and Methuselah GPCRs are also represented. The position of the Rhodopsin family was established by including
15 receptors from the Rhodopsin family. The divergent, "Other/Unclassified" GPCRs known to lack reliable homologs from other
species or which are fast evolving, are excluded from the final representation. For display reasons bootstrap values are not represented in the figure. Instead, the corresponding tree file in standard Newick format is provided [Additional data file 5]. For
Figure 2, and Figures 3, 5 and 6, the multiple sequence alignment was built taking into account terminally truncated TM spanning regions, while the consensus phylogenetic tree was calculated using NJ method on 1000 replicas of the dataset. Ciona
GPCR taxons are represented in numerals as per numbering in Additional data file 2. Abbreviations for known GPCRs are as
described in [5, 6, 8, 9] and based on Swiss-prot IDs. Ciona GPCRs that deviate from the predicted 7TM structure are marked
using a '#' symbol.
Since several of these "Unclassified Rhodopsins" and "Other
Rhodopsins" appear to be Ciona specific and were divergent
from the Rhodopsin subfamilies in other genomes, they
were excluded from the final phylogenetic representation
to avoid tree artefacts.
The LDLRR/LGR-like/GLHR cluster (32 members)
Ciona shows a novel lineage specific expansion and innovation in the LDLRR-GPCR/LGR-like/GLHR Rhodopsin
cluster with 32 receptors, 30 of which are similar to the
human INSL3/relaxin binding GPCRs in their TM regions.
Of the 32 receptors in this cluster, two sequences were
found
to
be
LGR-like
(ci0100148288
and
ci0100151424), with Leucine-rich repeat domains (LRR)
observable in their N-termini. The sequence
ci0100148288 possesses five LRR domains and was iden-

tified as a candidate INLS3/Relaxin GPCR-like based on
conserved domain database searches. The sequence
ci0100151424 is an N-terminal LRR containing GPCR
that does not bear any significant similarity to INSL3/
Relaxin binding GPCRs in its TM region. One glycoprotein
hormone
receptor
could
be
recovered
(ci0100133821) and was identified as an ortholog of
LHCGR (Lutenizing hormone/chorio-gonadotropin
receptor).
It is noteworthy that as many as 14 out of the 32 receptors
apart from bearing sequence similarity to INSL3/relaxin
binding GPCRs in their TM region, comprise of a low density lipoprotein receptor Class A domain (LDL-A) represented either singly or in 2–10 multiple tandem repeats at
the N-termini [Additional data file 3]. In contrast to other

Figure 3
Phylogenetic relationship between non-(LDLRR-GPCR/LGR) Rhodopsin receptors in Ciona and other genomes
Phylogenetic relationship between non-(LDLRR-GPCR/LGR) Rhodopsin receptors in Ciona and other
genomes. All members of the Ciona Rhodopsin subfamilies except for the LDRR-GPCRs/LGRs were included with closely
related sequences from other genomes to construct the phylogenetic tree. To ascertain the phylogenetic position of Ciona
LGR-like/LDLRR-GPCR cluster, 10 of those sequence members were added for tree reconstruction and later the branches
removed from the final representation to be replaced by an arrow. The divergent "Other/Unclassified Rhodopsins" known to lack
reliable homologs from other species, or which are fast evolving were excluded from the final representation. For display reasons boot strap values have not been shown. Instead, the corresponding tree file in standard Newick format is attached [Additional data file 6]. Ciona GPCRs that deviate from the predicted 7TM structure are marked using a '#' symbol.

vertebrate LGRs (LGR7/LGR8) where a single LDL-A module at the N terminus of the ectodomain is followed by
multiple LRRs and 7 TM helices, the 14 Ciona LDLRRGPCR family members lack LRRs [22] [Additional data
file 3]. Also notable is the fact that this unique domain
organisation of LDL-A domain tandem repeats in Ciona
has been reported only in snail LGR that contains tandem
repeats of LDL-A domains in addition to multiple LRR
domains [23] [Swiss-Prot: GR101_LYMST]. 14 additional
sequences belonging to this subfamily possess shorter Nterminal regions that do not contain any explicitly recognizable domains while bearing INSL3/Relaxin binding
GPCR-like TM regions [Additional data file 3]. These
sequences are therefore not authentic N-terminal associated "Leucine Rich Repeat containing GPCRs" and hence
been designated as "Unclassified LGR-like". It is possible
that the 14 "Unclassified LGR-like" sequences are fragmentary or incompletely modelled at the N-termini. At

least one instance of an incorrectly aligned domain architecture in a LDL-A domain bearing GPCR was revealed
(ci0100131758) after a BLAT of the sequence was performed against the Ciona genome. A proposed correct
model is provided in the Additional data file 1.
A phylogenetic analysis was carried out to resolve the relationship between the human LGRs (LGR 7/LGR 8), the
snail LGR, the 14 Ciona LDLRR-GPCR family members
(excluding
an
incorrectly
aligned
member:
ci0100131758) and the one candidate INSL3/Relaxin
binding GPCR-like sequence (ci0100148288). The unifying theme among all these receptors is their INSL3/
Relaxin binding GPCR-like TM region. This phylogenetic
tree was rooted using a human LHCGR and a Ciona
orphan LGR-like (ci0100151424) that are distantly
related to these sequences [Figure 4]. The receptors in this
data set were truncated to include only the sequence of the

intervening TM 1- TM 6/7 region. This truncation was carried out to eliminate the variabilities in the number of
LDL-A and LRR tandem repeats.
Phylogenetic analysis shows that the human LGRs, the
snail LGR, the 14 Ciona LDLRR-GPCRs and the one Ciona
INSL3/Relaxin GPCR-like (ci0100148288) clustered into
one group separately from the distantly related human
LHCGR and the Ciona LGR-like outgroup suggestive of a
common evolutionary origin to the INSL3/Relaxin GPCRlike 7 TM region. Furthermore, the domain analysis also
suggests that the 14 Ciona LDLRR-GPCRs and the one candidate Ciona INSL3/Relaxin GPCR-like seem to have
evolved independently of the human LGRs and the snail
LGR in the non-TM N-terminal regions.
The Glutamate family (8 members)
Many Glutamate (GLR) receptors are crucial modulators
involved in neurotransmission. Most of these receptors
have long N-termini that serve to bind a cognate ligand
[24]. The Ciona Glutamate family clustered with a strong
bootstrap support (998/1000) separating the cluster from
its closest neighbours (Figure 2). Phylogenetic analysis
revealed that the Ciona genome contains 8 members of
the Glutamate family. These receptors represent all of the
GLR subfamilies with the exception of Taste (TAS1) receptors. Human orthologs for Calcium-sensing receptor
(CASR), Retinoic acid inducible GPCR (RAIG), Metabotropic glutamate receptor (GRM) and GABA receptors
could be identified in Ciona with significant sequence
similarity. Among the Ciona GLRs, the CASR
(ci0100130340) homolog displayed the highest identity
to the human counterpart CASR (34.7%). ESTs for the
metabotropic GABAB related receptor (ci0100152670)
could be retrieved from the neural-complex tissues in
Ciona, suggesting similar roles for this receptor in synaptic
function as proposed in vertebrates [Additional data file 2:
sheet 2].
The Secretin family (8 members)
The Secretin family includes receptors for calcitonin
(CALCR), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIPR2), glucagon-like peptide (GLPR), pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), the parathyroid hormone
receptor (PTHR) and several other related peptides as well
as hormones [5]. The Ciona Secretin family received very
high bootstrap support (999 out of 1000 NJ trees) (Figure
2). 8 GPCRs could be identified in Ciona and are related
to the vertebrate Secretin family with which they shared
high sequence similarity. The phylogenetic clustering also
supports possible specific gene duplication events for
three pairs of sequences, evident from the high bootstrap
support (>80%) for the tree nodes for the pairs
(ci0100139945/ci0100151327),
(ci0100145252/
ci0100145281), and (ci0100145584/ci0100145837).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/129

This is consistent with the recent report on the evolution
of Secretin family receptors in Ciona [25]. The gene pair
(ci0100139945/ci0100151327) clusters with the PTHR
subfamily of receptors, while the pair (ci0100145252/
ci0100145281) clusters with GLPR group. The remaining
pair (ci0100145584/ci0100145837) clusters with the
CRHR group, whereas ci0100141310 and ci0100141557
appear to be orthologs of GLPR and CALCR/CALCRL
respectively (Figure 2). Among Secretin receptors, the
Ciona PTHR homologs (ci0100139945/ci0100151327)
showed the highest sequence identity (37% identity to
PTHR1 in both cases) to their human counterparts (Additional file 4).
The Frizzled/Smoothened family (4 members)
The Ciona proteome data set contains 4 members of the
Frizzled/Smoothened GPCR family each of which have at
least 6 TM regions. The Ciona Frizzled receptor cluster
branched out with a very high bootstrap support (100%)
in NJ trees (Figure 2). Frizzled receptors have been shown
to couple with G-proteins after activation by Wnt, a glycoprotein ligand and are known to play a key role in tissuepolarity and cell signalling [26,27]. The Frizzled family is
a recently identified group among the GPCRs, although its
origin can be traced back to the arthropods. Ciona possesses a clear one-to-one ortholog each for human FZD3,
FZD5 and FZD10 apart from a smoothened-like (SMOH)
ortholog. The conserved (K-T-X-X-X-W) motif required for
Wnt/β-Catenin signalling pathway can be observed two
amino acids after the seventh transmembrane helix in all
the recovered Ciona Frizzled receptors [28]. An alignment
of the TM regions of the Frizzled ortholog pairs (FZD) of
humans and Ciona revealed that they are very well conserved with identities in range of ~48–60 %. The SMOH
receptor shares ~57 % identity with its Ciona ortholog
(ci0100150930) in the TM region. However, the Taste2
(TAS2) receptors seem to be absent in Ciona.

In a separate analysis, we identified four more Ciona Frizzled family members (ci0100152761, ci0100150136,
ci0100138855 and ci0100153324) that were fragmentary
models with less than 4 TM regions. These fragmentary
sequences were not included in the final Ciona GPCR
dataset for better handling of the MSA (Multiple sequence
alignment) data for subsequent phylogenetic studies.
The Adhesion family (30 members)
The Ciona genome includes 30 Adhesion family members
and is the second largest group of GPCRs after the Rhodopsin family. This family is characterized by long N-termini that contain multiple functional domains with
adhesion-like motifs that are often sites of glycosylation
events [29]. It is noteworthy that Ciona with a relatively
smaller genome possesses as many Adhesion members as
any of the other larger vertebrate genomes [5,6,8]. The

Page 8 of 19

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:129

density (number of Adhesion genes/genome size) of GPCR
Adhesion family is 1 gene/~5 Kb in Ciona whereas it is 1
gene/~90 Kb for human. This denser Ciona GPCR group
relative to human genome is also accompanied by a lack
of clear-cut homology to human Adhesion GPCRs. Among
all the major family clusters in our analysis, the Adhesion
family received the lowest bootstrap support (401 out of
1000 NJ trees) (Figure 2). Of the 30 Ciona receptors identified, 6 showed unambiguous orthologous relationship
with human members in a large scale comparison of the
Adhesion GPCRs of the two genomes (data not shown).
Ciona Adhesion members that received complete support
from its human counterparts were included in the final
representation (Figure 2). The human genome contains
33 Adhesion receptors that display a phylogenetic clustering into eight main groups (I-VIII) [29]. Ciona orthologs
of the human Adhesion subfamilies includes one representative (ci0100145494) of the HE6/GP126 cluster
(human group VIII), one representative (ci0100130008)
of the GPR123-125 cluster (human group III) and one
ortholog (ci0100132112) of the CELSR genes (human
group IV) [29]. The remaining 3 receptors
(ci0100137028, ci0100140016 and ci0100150579) are
orthologous to the LEC subfamily of human Adhesion
group I.
A search for potential orthologs of the remaining 24 Ciona
receptors using PIPEALIGN and further phylogenetic
analysis with top hits from the search failed to identify
unambiguous orthologs when performing both NJ and
Maximum Likelihood analysis. Adhesion GPCRs that
could not be assigned specific subfamilies due to lack of
support in cross-genome phylogenetic analysis were
deemed as "Unclassified Adhesion". 21 of the 24Ciona
"Unclassified Adhesion" models had only the GPS proteolytic domain in the N-termini. Among the remaining
three "Unclassified Adhesion" receptors, ci0100130017 had
a LRR domain while ci0100132869 and ci0100131580
protein models possess EGF repeats in the N-termini.
A phylogenetic analysis of the Ciona Adhesion GPCRs was
performed on the region from the TM 1 to TM 7 of the
receptors. The analysis revealed that the Ciona Adhesion
family clustered into five different groups each receiving
more than 75 % bootstrap support in (1000 bootstraps)
NJ trees (Figure 5). The five clusters were denoted as
Group I to Group V. This group assignment of the Adhesion GPCRs is Ciona specific and is independent of the
human Adhesion groups referred to by Bjarnadottir et.al.,
2004 [29]. 16 Ciona Adhesion receptors could be included
into these five groups reflecting a probable paralogous
relationship between the groups. The remaining Adhesion
receptors remain as outgroups and do not cluster with sufficient phylogenetic support with other Ciona members.
The phylogenetic analysis indicates that Ciona Adhesion

Phylogenetic relationship within the Ciona GPCR set
of Adhesion receptors. A phylogeny of Ciona Adhesion
GPCRs shows the presence of five different paralogous clusters (group I- group V). Tree branches that support the five

repertoire constitutes a very diverse set of receptors sharing relatively poor sequence identity (Figure 5). The three
members in Group III share the least identity (20%) while
the two members in Group V were the most identical
(89%). The Group V receptors are presumably gene duplication events as evident from the high bootstrap support
(100%) of that node. Three members belonging to Group
II share 25 % identity, while the five members of the
Group I and the three members in Group IV share 23 %
and 25 % identities respectively. In all cases, only the

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:129

identities within the TM regions were considered. Group
IV constitutes receptors that are orthologous to human
LEC/ETL subfamily of receptors. In addition to the gene
pair (ci0100152766/ci0100130804) in Group V, our
analysis also lends support to a hypothesis of two more
probable gene duplication events for the tree nodes
(ci0100130776/ci0100139268) and (ci0100134612/
ci0100152008) (Figure 5). Sequence alignment of the TM
regions revealed that the ci0100130776/ci0100139268
pair receptors were 57% identical while the
ci0100134612/ci0100152008 pair shares an identity of
52 %.
Specialized tunicate GPCRs
Our analysis revealed that the Ciona genome contains at
least two representatives that could not be classified as
unambiguous orthologs of the GRAFS families. These
include one receptor (ci0100132129) that is similar to the
protist Dictyostelium cAMP/Crl GPCR family and while the
other receptor (ci0100150391) is homologous to the
insect related Methuselah protein. The two Ciona receptors cluster with the corresponding cAMP and Methuselah
GPCRs in a cross-genome phylogenetic analysis with a
strong bootstrap support of 769 and 739 respectively,
(out of 1000 replicates) in NJ trees (Figure 2). cAMP
receptors in Dictyostelium discoideum mediate the coordinated aggregation of individual cells into a multi-cellular
organism and regulate the expression levels of a number
of developmentally regulated genes [30-32] while Crl
receptors are implicated in cell growth regulation and tip
formation in developing aggregates [33]. The Methuselah
GPCR in Drosophila plays a role in ageing and increased
resistance to several forms of stress including heat, starvation and oxidative damage [34]. The cAMP/Crl receptors
are believed to be represented exclusively in protists, plant
and fungal kingdoms while the Methuselah GPCR is
thought to be present only in insects.

A BLASTP search for closest homolog of the Ciona cAMP
GPCR-like sequence in the non-redundant NCBI database
revealed that the Ciona sequence is most identical to predicted proteins in sea anemone (Nematostella vectensis)
[Swiss-Prot: A7SN55] and Danio rerio [GenBank:
XP_001332705] with an overall sequence identity of 42%
for both cases. The recovered Nematostella sequence was
observed to have only 5 TM regions. An alignment of the
Ciona receptor and its sea anemone homolog showed an
identity of nearly 37% when only the TM regions were
considered. Among the Dictyostelium cAMP/Crl family
members, the Ciona sequence ci0100132129 shows best
identity with CARC (~21% identical in the TM regions),
while the best identity among the Crl members is CrlA
(~19 % identical in TM regions). Likewise, a BLASTP
search with the Ciona Methuselah-like homolog
(ci0100150391) with other insect genomes revealed that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/129

it is ~23% identical in the TM region to a MTH 10-like
receptor
in
the
Apis
mellifera
genome
(PIR:UPI0000DB6BC5). However, the ectodomain that
characterizes the Drosophila Methuselah GPCR is absent in
the Ciona homolog.

Discussion
Our phylogenetic analysis includes a collection of 169
putative Ciona GPCR sequences and highlights in detail
the remarkable level of orthology between the protochordate and vertebrate GPCRs. Our analysis clearly suggests
that a majority of the identified Ciona GPCRs have a clear
vertebrate and in particular, a human homolog at the level
of the major GRAFS subfamilies. Our results also show
that at the individual gene level there are as many as 66
clear orthologs of human GPCRs in Ciona (Additional file
5). Given that Ciona possesses ancestral GPCR versions of
the higher vertebral counterparts, there are also remarkable instances of lineage specific evolution as seen in the
Rhodopsin and Adhesion families. From a protochordate
perspective, the major differences from the human GPCRs
in the Ciona repertoire can be attributed to the presence of
23 "Other Rhodopsins", the Ciona specific gene innovations
of the LDLRR-GPCR cluster (14 sequences) and the unusually large Adhesion family (24 Unclassified Adhesion
sequences). The presence of many "Unclassified/Other"
GPCRs for which reliable orthologs could not be identified (via phylogenetic analysis) in other species, indicate
that these are most likely ascidian specific genes. The other
possibility is that these genes are evolving at a rapid rate,
so much so that reliable orthologs could not be detected.
In our final analysis and depiction of phylogenetic trees,
we chose not to include these sets of "Unclassified/Other"
sequences to avoid artefacts that can arise out of including
sequences that are either evolving at a rapid rate or for
which intermediate homologs could not be identified.
Instances of incomplete/poorly modelled genes can also
be a cause for the failure to detect reliable homologs for
many of these GPCRs. With further sequencing and analysis of GPCRs in other protochordate genomes, it is likely
to become clear if these genes are indeed protochordate
related diversifications.
Our analysis of the Ciona GPCR family suggests that while
the number of Adhesion receptors are comparable to that
in vertebrates, the other GPCR families/subfamilies
excepting that of the LDLRR-GPCRs, are represented at
nearly 2 to 5 fold fewer numbers compared to the humans
[Table 1, Table 2]. This observation is only expected for a
genome that is 20 times smaller than the human genome.
The Rhodopsin Family
Among the Rhodopsin receptors, the human α- and βgroup subfamilies are analogously represented in Ciona
while among the seven subfamilies of the human γ- – and

Page 10 of 19

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:129

δ-groups, orthologs of the PUR, classical CHEM, MCHR
and MRG receptor subfamilies could not be identified by
phylogeny (Additional file 6). Simple BLAST searches
identified many Ciona receptors as being similar to chemokine receptor cluster, but they did not receive sufficient
support in the phylogenetic analysis. These were annotated as "Unclassifed Chemokine receptor cluster-like". It
is possible that these are highly divergent homologs of the
chemokine receptor cluster genes. The absence of a clear
classical chemokine (CCRs, CXCRs) receptor ortholog in
Ciona agrees with previous finding that the evolution of
chemokine receptors arose after the split of the vertebrates
from the protochordate lineage [35].
Ciona has two representatives belonging to the prostaglandin receptor cluster. Although Drosophila has one remote
homolog of a prostaglandin receptor, a readily recognizable homolog of a vertebrate-like prostaglandin is first
observed only in the protochordate lineage. The sequence
identities of Ciona prostaglandin receptors with human
PTGER4 range from ~21 – 23%. Prostaglandin receptors
mediate a wide variety of actions and play important
physiological roles in the cardiovascular and immune systems and in pain sensation in peripheral systems [36].
Reliable ESTs can be recovered from neural tissues for the
PTGER homolog (ci0100153844) suggesting that these
receptor homologs are involved in neural tissue physiology [Additional data file 2: sheet 2].
Among the peptide receptors, Ciona has a single copy of
an authentic Tachykinin receptor which has been proposed to play an important role in feeding and sexual
behaviour of the ascidians [37]. Furthermore, putative
receptors for peptides like GnRH, Cionin (CCK/gastrinrelated peptide), Oxytocin/Arginine-vasopressin and
Hypocretin/Orexin were recovered in Ciona [Additional
data file 2]. Among the Ciona GPCRs the GnRH receptor
remains the best studied and is the only known example
of an authentic protochordate gonadotropin receptor to
date [38]. A GnRHR- like protein in Drosophila was later
found to be activated by AKH, a peptide structurally similar to GnRH, thus making Ciona the only available protochordate model to possess authentic GnRHRs [39]. So far,
three GnRHR-like Ciona homologs have been found to be
active in assays and are known to stimulate both the cAMP
and IP3 signalling pathways. A cannabinoid receptor
homolog
(ci0100149095)
and
a
receptor
(ci0100136887) that is most closely related to the lysophospholipid receptors were also identified. We could not
recover cannabinoid receptor homologs from the
genomes of protostomes, while homologs were found in
echinoderms suggesting that these receptors have their
origins in a common deuterostomal ancestor to echinoderms and chordates. ESTs for the EDG homolog
(ci0100136887) were recovered from blood cells/haemo-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/129

cytes suggesting that these receptors may have a role in the
nervous system similar to that observed for vertebrate
EDG receptors [40,41].
Structural Innovations in the Ciona LDLRR/LGR-like/
GLHR Rhodopsin cluster
Ciona shows a notable lineage specific gene innovation
and gene expansion (14 confirmed members) of the
LDLRR-GPCRs (Low density lipoprotein receptor repeat
containing receptors). These receptors have TM regions
that are homologous to vertebrate INSL3/Relaxin binding
GPCRs. Lineage specific gene expansions have long been
observed in several cases including that of the opsin and
fish odorant receptor expansions in puffer fish [6] and
trace amine receptor expansion in zebrafish [42]. The
LDLRR-GPCR subfamily in Ciona displays an unusual
combination of LDL-A domain tandem repeats in the Ntermini. Although the presence of a single LDL-A domain
in GPCRs was first observed in mammals, our unpublished study shows that the LDL-A domain repeats in
GPCRs exist in protostomes (Molluscs, Arthropods) and
in early deuterostomes like echinoderms (Strongylocentratus purpuratus) and Ciona suggesting that the origin of
these receptors can be traced back to a common bilateral
ancestor. The presence of LDL-A repeats in mosaic proteins has long been known and is an example that supports the exon shuffling theory [43,44].

Based on phylogeny and domain architecture analysis we
propose that while the signatures for the LDL-A domain
and LRR domain containing Rhodopsin subfamily first
arose in a bilateral metazoan ancestor, this subfamily has
undergone several lineage specific innovations at the level
of the combinations and tandem repeats of these
domains. Our analysis suggests that the 14 Ciona LDLRRGPCRs (in which the LRR domains are absent) have
evolved divergently as a group [Figure 4, Additional data
file 3]. This divergence is evident in the phylogenetic analysis of the TM regions of this group with those of the snail
and human LGRs (Figure 4). It is possible that changes in
the TM regions presumably accommodates for the
changes that have occurred in the Ciona primary ligand
binding N-terminal region that contain LDL-A domains
but lack LRRs.
In vertebrate INSL3/relaxin binding GPCRs, a combination of a single cysteine-rich LDL-A domain and multiple
LRRs at the ectodomain site is necessary for ligand binding, receptor activation and further downstream signalling from these receptors [45]. Receptors that lack the
LDL-A domain were found to bind relaxin, but were unable to effect cAMP accumulation [46]. The LRR region in
the ectodomain is essential for binding of glycoprotein
hormones [47]. Notwithstanding the incomplete
sequence information in the case of the 14 "Unclassified

Page 11 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:129

LGR-like" sequences that do not have any identifiable
domains at the N-termini, it is evident that the architecture of the 14 confirmed Ciona LDLRR-GPCRs that lack
LRR domains is very different from vertebrate type C LGRs
(LGR7/LGR8). These receptors are thus functionally unrelated to vertebrate INSL3/relaxin peptide binding receptors.
A typical cysteine-rich LDL-A domain found in human
LDL receptor and human LDL Receptor related Protein
(LRP) consists of ~40 amino acids containing six cysteine
residues at fixed positions with the region between the
fifth and sixth cysteines rich in aspartic and glutamic acid
residues. These acidic residues in LDL receptors are known
to interact with basic amino acids in lipoproteins [48,49].
The human LDL receptor contains at least 7 class A repeats
[50,51] while the LRPs contain clusters of 2, 8, 10 and 11
repeats [52]. Furthermore, in the LRPs, these repeats bind
to large protein complexes like the α2 macroglobulin-protease complexes and urokinase-type plasminogen activator-plasminogen activator inhibitor (uPA-PAI) [53,54]. A
majority of LDL-A-like repeats in the 14 Ciona LDLRRGPCRs conform to the classical LDL-A repeat structure. It
is thus tempting to speculate that these domains are crucial for the specific function of the receptors and that these
receptors likely bind to lipoproteins or large protein complexes as ligands, analogous to the classical human LDL
receptor. This hypothesis based on comparative domain
analysis may serve as a pointer towards further molecular
studies. A similar hypothesis that the snail GRL101 receptor which contains both LDL-A and LRR repeats might be
a member of a putative class of GPCRs that directly transduce signals carried by large extracellular (lipo)protein
(complexe)s, has been proposed earlier [23]. The differences between the snail LGR-like and the Ciona LDLRRGPCRs lie in the possibility that the snail receptor which
contains LRRs can potentially offer a different ligand presentation mechanism compared to the Ciona receptors that
lack LRRs.
Although direct evidence of lipoproteins as GPCR signalling agents is not available, previous evidence suggests
that LDL molecules at physiological concentrations can
activate phosphatidylinositol signalling and mobilization
of calcium from intracellular stores in the absence of LDL
receptor mediation [55,56]. Similarly, HDL stimulation
of cAMP formation has also been demonstrated [57].
However, to the best of our knowledge, no authentic
GPCR has been demonstrated to bind to lipoproteins as
signalling molecules and therefore it should be a crucial
step forward to de-orphanize this family of GPCRs in
Ciona. A search of the Ciona EST database for matches to
the novel Ciona LDLRR-GPCR protein models revealed
that a majority of the hits are derived from the blood tissue and haemocytes [Additional data file 2: sheet 2]. Iden-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/129

tification of three putative Ciona orthologs of vertebrate
INSL-relaxin-like genes has recently been reported [58].
Furthermore, the authors hypothesize that the Ciona
INSL/RLN orthologs most likely interacts with a Ciona
RTK-receptor and not a GPCR and the receptor switch
from RTK-receptor to a GPCR occurred after the split of
Ciona from the common lineage leading to the vertebrates
[58]. From our own analysis of the 32 Ciona receptors in
the LDLRR-GPCR/LGR-like/GLHR cluster, we found two
LRR bearing LGR-like sequences (ci0100148288 &
ci0100151424). Conserved domain searches of these two
receptors further narrowed down only one candidate
INSL3/relaxin receptor-like (ci0100148288) sequence. A
phylogenetic analysis of Ciona sequence (ci0100148288)
with vertebrate type C INSL3/Relaxin receptors (Figure 4)
revealed that the Ciona receptor is not orthologous to vertebrate type C LGRs and is therefore unlikely to bind to
vertebrate INSL3/Relaxin versions. Our analysis does not
however exclude the possibility that the two LGR-like
Ciona sequences (ci0100148288 & ci0100151424) can
bind to the Ciona INSL-relaxin orthologs.
The Ciona GPCR Adhesome
Unlike vertebrates which possess multiple functional
Adhesion N-terminal domains that include lectin, cadherin and laminin domains among others, the Ciona
GPCR adhesome possesses a less complex domain organisation with a single GPS domain in 21 out of 30 receptors. Furthermore, these receptors did not correspond
with any clear ortholog in other vertebrates. Orthologs for
the vertebrate CELSR, LEC, GP123-GP125 and HE6 class
of receptors could be observed but orthologs of other
Adhesion members previously documented in human are
missing.

The ligands and biological functions of Adhesion GPCRs
are largely unknown. Orthologs belonging to the CELSR,
HE6 and GP123/124/125 subfamilies have only a single
representative in Ciona making it an interesting model for
studying the roles of these GPCRs. The CELSR family of
GPCRs in mammals play a possible functional role in the
developmental processes of the brain and the peripheral
nervous system [59]. Although a search of the Ciona EST
database did not reveal any analogous distribution of
CELSR homologs in neural tissues, this does not necessarily exclude its expression in these regions. The Ciona
CELSR model showed maximum (~34%) identity with
human CELSR2 while displaying a remarkable level of
conservation in the N-terminal domain architecture. The
Ciona CELSR homolog contains 9 cadherin domain
repeats, 2 laminin G-like motifs, 1 laminin EGF-like
motif, 7 EGF-like calcium binding motifs and the characteristic GPS domain identical to that in human CELSR2.

Among mammalian LEC receptors, LEC1 and LEC3
expression is abundant in the brain tissue [60]. LEC1
binds to α-latrotoxin and has a role in exocytosis of the
synaptic vesicles [61]. The other vertebrate LEC homologs
are unable to function as a-latrotoxin receptors and their
physiological roles remain unknown. Ciona also has at
least three phylogenetically identifiable LEC homologs for
which reliable ESTs can be recovered from the gastrula
and neurula, cleavage stage embryo and tail-bud embryo
developmental stages suggestive of a role for these receptors in developmental processes [Additional data file 2:
Sheet 2]. It should be interesting to explore the presence
of LEC homologs in neural tissues of Ciona to compare
biochemical roles of LEC GPCR biology between vertebrates and protochordates. As many as three gene duplication events can be suspected in the Ciona GPCR adhesome
(Figure 5). Ciona can be a very good model where the
developmental role of Adhesion orthologs can be investigated at the single cell level because the larvae contain
approximately 2600 cells and the lineage of the embryonic cells giving rise to different tissue types has been well
determined [62].
The cAMP GPCR-like and Methuselah-like GPCR in Ciona
The cAMP/Crl GPCRs belong to an ancient family of
GPCRs with homologs observed in the protists, fungi and
plants as reported in the Pfam database [63]. However,
authentic cAMP GPCRs have been characterized only in
the protist Dictyotelium discoideum [64]. The Ciona cAMP
GPCR-like sequence shows best identity with predicted
hypothetical proteins in Danio rerio and Nematostella vectensis. The top hit in a search with the Ciona cAMP GPCRlike sequence (ci0100132129) in the PRINTS database
was the Dictyostelium cAMP receptors (CARs) with
matches for 4 out of 7 sequence motifs and an E-value of
1.6e-05 [65]. The next best hit was the GABAB GPCR of the
Glutamate family with matches for 2 out of 14 sequence
motifs and an E-value of 23. A recent study on the GPCR
repertoire in the Branchiostoma floridae genome reports
two cAMP GPCR-like sequences with limited sequence
identities [12]. The ESTs for the Methuselah-like sequence
(ci0100150391) were found only in the adult digestive
gland suggesting a possible role for this GPCR in digestive
processes. [Additional data file 2: sheet 2].

Although the putative non-GRAFS Ciona GPCRs
ci0100132129 and ci0100150391 cluster with cAMP and
Methuselah GPCR families with significant bootstrap support, they share only limited sequence identities (~19–25
%) with homologous members of their respective families. Evidently, sequence homology at these levels does
not imply functional homology. It is possible that these
sequences are highly divergent homologs of the cAMP and
Methuselah GPCR families. The recovery of Ciona ESTs for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/129

both receptors confirmed that these genes are endogenously expressed. [Additional data file 2: Sheet 2].
GPCR Orthologs of human disease genes
Ciona has representatives of GPCRs that are associated
with diseases in humans. Among the 15 monogenic
GPCR disease genes known to date, Ciona has orthologs of
6 receptors [Table 3]. The motivation for identification of
these GPCR orthologs is to facilitate the conception of
studies that will have implications for human health. For
example, the mammalian CASR gene is known to be
expressed in parathyroid glands and its loss in parathyroid
gland in mice is implicated in hypercalcemia, hyperparathyroidism and growth retardation [66]. Similarly,
monogenic mutations of the PTHR1 gene is known to be
involved in chondrodysplasia and multi-organ disorders,
while monogenic mutants of Vasopressin receptor
(AVPR2) are implicated in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
[67]. EST matches for CASR, PTHR1 and AVPR2 orthologs
can be recovered in Ciona [Additional data file 2: Sheet 2].
The tunicate can thus prove an excellent model to probe
the roles of these genes. Although physiological roles of
these receptors may differ between humans and Ciona,
studying their roles at the biochemical and genetic level in
Ciona will potentially pave the way for a better understanding of its vertebrate counterparts.
Sequence conservation of Ciona PTHRs
A particular instance of orthology that will provide clues
for the physiological roles of ancestral GPCRs is the PTHR
orthologs in Ciona that share a high sequence identity
with both vertebrate PTHR-1 and PTHR-2. PTHR-1-ligand
interactions and their mechanism of action in vertebrates
are well understood. PTHR-1 is abundantly expressed in
bones and kidney and is known to play an important role
in mediating PTH regulated mineral ion homeostasis and
endochondral bone formation [68]. Mutations in vertebrate PTHRs and ligands are linked to a number of genetic
diseases affecting skeletal development and calcium
homeostasis [69]. Hence, the discovery of homologs for
these receptors in a protochordate system is of special
interest. Unlike PTHR-1, which is ubiquitously expressed,
PTHR-2 is expressed in brain, testis, placenta and cardiac
endothelium. The physiological roles of PTHR-2 however,
are not clearly established [68].

A multiple sequence alignment of Ciona PTHRs with those
of vertebrates reveal several conserved motifs [Additional
data file 4]. The sequence conservation across many functionally important residues responsible for ligand binding
and downstream G-protein coupling makes it likely that
the putative Ciona PTHRs can cross-react specifically with
mammalian PTH/PTH related peptides and can signal
downstream by coupling to G-proteins. Interestingly,
Ciona PTHR homologs exhibit high sequence conserva-

tion across sites known to be associated with Blomstrand's
[70-72] and Jansen's syndrome in humans [73-75]. The
absence of defined N- and C-terminal regions in Ciona
PTHR homologs again seem to be a result of incomplete
modelling and a clear picture should emerge with further
refinement of the genome or through experimental studies. Information from the existing protein models
(ci0100139945 and ci0100151327) should prove useful
for performing experiments addressing the physiological
roles of these receptors in a protochordate and its evolution in subsequent lineages.

Conclusion
A genome-wide analysis of the repertoire of putative
GPCRs in Ciona intestinalis was carried out, revealing
many intriguing aspects of ascidian GPCR evolution.
While as many as 39% of Ciona GPCR sequences are
orthologous to vertebrate GPCR subfamilies, a substantial
number seem to represent invertebrate-chordate related
diversification. The observation of orthologs of several
GPCRs related to vertebrate heart and neural tissue physiology raises the possibility that genetic studies of Ciona
GPCRs can be exploited to assess the functions of complementary higher vertebrate genes. The availability of Ciona
EST hits with matches for 133 of the 169 putative GPCRs
will facilitate further studies to elucidate their functional
roles. The compact GPCR repertoire in the Ciona model
also presents fewer complications in terms of functional
redundancy and offers an advantage to study the evolution and function of these receptors. In summary, our
analysis leads the way towards understanding the invertebrate-chordate GPCR signalling system and helps identify
candidate vertebrate GPCR homologs in Ciona to be
selected for functional studies.

Methods
Description of Ciona intestinalis sequence data set
The official version of the Ciona intestinalis JGI v2.0 database was used as the source for obtaining the complete
proteome [76]. The current size of this tunicate assembly
is 173 Mb with approximately 94 Mb of the assembly
being mapped to chromosomes, while the remaining 45
% of the genome is included in scaffolds. The proteome
dataset includes 15,852 proteins and sequences in the current version include both automated and to a lesser
extent, manually curated annotations. A CD-HIT [77] was
performed on the proteome set with 99% identity cut-off
to obtain a non-redundant dataset that is devoid of splice
variants, duplicates and polymorphisms. Non-redundancy of the data set was also verified by a manual check.
Prediction of Transmembrane regions
Transmembrane regions in the Ciona proteome were predicted using secondary structure predictions tools like
HMMTOP [78], TMHMM [79] and SOSUI [80] with
default settings. A majority of known GPCRs acquire maximum coverage in the 7 TM domain prediction analyses
[6]. Since the default settings have been known to underpredict or over-predict TM segments, peptides covering
the entire range of 6, 7 and 8 TM domains were retrieved
using each of the above programs. The predicted
sequences recovered from these programs were later clustered and any redundancy in the (6–8) TM data set was
removed. This resulted in 645 unique putative GPCR
sequences that were analyzed for GPCR specific patterns
using a variety of similarity and pattern search tools in a
concerted and comprehensive manner. The strategy to
identify protein models with 6/7/8 transmembrane
regions while missing out on fragmentary or incomplete
GPCR models from the JGI Ciona proteome allows for a

better handling of the putative GPCR data set for multiple
sequence alignment and phylogenetic studies.
Identification of GPCRs using HMMPFAM
Customized HMM models for all known GPCR families/
subfamilies recognized by the GPCRDB [81], were constructed from ClustalW version 1.83 [82] generated multiple
alignments
using
HMMBUILD
and
HMMCALIBRATE programs of HMMER package version
2.3.2 [83]. HMMPFAM program was used to query a database of custom-built GPCR HMMs and all (6–8) TM Ciona
queries that returned hits with an E-value better than 0.01
were extracted. The HMM files and seed alignments are
available upon request. Default settings were used in all
HMMBUILD and HMMCALIBRATE model builds.
Identification of GPCRs using RPS-BLAST
Position Specific Scoring Matrices (PSSMs) for all GPCR
families/subfamilies recognized by the GPCRDB were
generated using BLASTPGP program [84]. A collection of
these GPCR PSSMs was then formatted using FORMATRPSDB to construct RPS-BLAST databases. All GPCR
family specific PSSMs were generated with known GPCR
sequences being used in a two-round iteration search
against the corresponding GPCR family-specific database
obtained from GPCRDB. For example, a CLASS A (Rhodopsin) Amine family PSSM is generated by BLASTPGP
using a set of known CLASS A Amine GPCRs as a query
against a CLASS A amine database with two rounds of iteration (-j option). FORMATRPSDB operations were carried
out with default settings. GPCR family or subfamily specific PSSMs are available upon request. The Ciona (6–8)
TM data set was searched against a database of custommade GPCR PSSMs by an RPS-BLAST search with a cut-off
at E = 0.001 and the best hits were recovered.
Identification of GPCRs using BLASTP
GPCR sequences were downloaded from the ftp site of
GPCRDB and BLASTP [85] similarity comparisons were
performed using the Ciona (6–8) TM dataset as query with
an E-value = 10-12. Ciona queries that returned hits better
than the cutoff were extracted into a temporary file.
Identification of remote homologs
In order to identify homologs for receptors that did not
identify themselves with any human sequence, we performed PIPEALIGN searches. PIPEALIGN [86] is a web
service that enables collection of potentially homologous
sequences based on the query through a series of automated and integrative profile based search steps and
finally presents the retrieved hits clustered into subfamilies in the context of a multiple sequence alignment
(MSA). The MSA cluster results from PIPEALIGN proved
to be a good starting point from which closest neighbours
could be identified with a quick-fire NJ or ML analysis.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/129

The nearest neighbour (the species adjacent to the query
through the least number of internal nodes or in the case
of a tie, via the shortest branch length) from such an analysis was identified and hand picked for inclusion into the
final analysis.
For example, a typical identification of Ciona cAMP
GPCR-like and Methuselah-like receptors was carried out
by performing searches of these sequence queries on the
web-versions of PIPEALIGN, Interproscan [87] and
BLASTP (Blastp of Uniref100 database [88]). The hits
from these searches were used for a preliminary NJ and
ML analysis. After a manual check of the alignment for the
hits, the nearest neighbour from such an analysis was then
included into the final representative phylogenetic tree
reconstruction.
Orthology assignment using BLASTP and phylogenetic
methods
Human GPCR sequences were obtained from Fredriksson
et.al [5] as well as from the GPCRDB. Ciona protein models that were returned as hits based on similarity/pattern
searches (HMM/BLASTP/RPS-BLAST) were compiled
together into one dataset. This initial dataset includes
many redundant sequences identified simultaneously by
two or more similarity/pattern searches. The final nonredundant Ciona GPCR dataset consisted of 169 proteins.

To ensure that orthology assignments are sound, a twoway BLASTP search was initially performed followed by
phylogenetic analysis. Both Ciona-human and humanCiona BLASTP searches were carried out resulting in the
identification of sequences that were the top hits to each
other. Orthologs were also detected based on crossgenome phylogenetic analysis of the human-Ciona GPCR
datasets. The final orthology assignment was arrived at
based on a consensus of the BLASTP/Reverse BLASTP
results and the cross-genome phylogenetic analysis [Additional data file 2: sheet 1]. This final orthology assignment
was also independently verified by searches of the Ciona
sequences against conserved domain databases (Interproscan) and stand-alone local GPCR HMM databases.
Identification of genomic positions of GPCRs using
TBLASTN
The best Ciona genome positions were identified for each
Ciona GPCR using TBLASTN with an E-value cut off at 105. All hits were manually inspected and the best genomic
positions providing entire coverage of each query was
extracted and imported in Excel sheets. [Additional data
file 2: sheet 1]

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:129

EST-hits and tissue/developmental stage based expression
data
The entire UniGene database of Ciona was downloaded
from the ftp site [89] and locally installed. Ciona GPCR
sequences were queried against the UniGene database
using TBLASTN with the E-value set at 1e-15. The identifiers of the EST-hit collection were imported in an excel
sheet and categorized based on their derivative developmental stage/tissue source to assist in gene finding and
transcriptome analysis. [Additional data file 2: sheet 2]
Phylogenetic Methods
Based on the initial Ciona-human BLASTP searches, Ciona
GPCRs were broadly divided into Rhodopsin families and
subfamilies and non-Rhodopsin receptors. The broadly
separated GPCR families were then combined with their
related GPCRs from either human or other species. MSAs
were then performed using MAFFT version 5 [90] with
protein weight matrix JTT200 and employing the E-INS-I
strategy with a gap opening penalty of 1.53 and offset
value of 0.123. All phylogenetic analyses shown arise out
of consideration of only the terminally truncated TM
spanning regions. Deviant branches were analysed and
the corresponding sequences checked for false positives
by looking for GPCR specific signatures or through Interproscan searches. The GRAFS (Glutamate, Rhodopsin, Adhesion, Frizzled, Secretin) dataset, the GPCR adhesome, the
cAMP GPCR analysis and the non-(LDLRR-GPCR/LGRlike) Rhodopsin subsets were bootstrapped 1000 times
using SEQBOOT from the PHYLIP package [version] [91].
The alignments were then used for subsequent distance
matrices (JTT matrix) calculation by PROTDIST to obtain
1000 matrices. To obtain unrooted trees, neighbour-joining method was employed (NEIGHBOR) and a consensus
of 1000 neighbour trees was arrived at using CONSENSE.
The topology and phylogenetic support for the above
mentioned tree representations was also verified using
TREE-PUZZLE analysis. The divergent "Unclassified/Other"
GPCRs were removed from the final data set to avoid tree
artefacts [92].

Maximum likelihood tree of the LGR-like/LDLRR-GPCR
cluster was obtained after performing 10,000 quartet puzzling steps with TREE-PUZZLE [version 5.2] [93] using a
percentage of invariant sites to be estimated and eight rate
categories to describe among-site rate variation with the
shape parameter estimated from the data and employing
VT (Mueller-Vingron 2000) substitution model. The NJ
trees were visualized and edited using SPLITSTREE version
4 [94] and the TREE-PUZZLE trees were visualized using
Tree view [95]
