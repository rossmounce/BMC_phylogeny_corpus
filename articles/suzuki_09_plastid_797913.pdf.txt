Abstract
Background: Plastids arose from a free-living cyanobacterial endosymbiont and multiply by binary
division as do cyanobacteria. Plastid division involves nucleus-encoded homologs of cyanobacterial
division proteins such as FtsZ, MinD, MinE, and ARC6. However, homologs of many other
cyanobacterial division genes are missing in plant genomes and proteins of host eukaryotic origin,
such as a dynamin-related protein, PDV1 and PDV2 are involved in the division process. Recent
identification of plastid division proteins has started to elucidate the similarities and differences
between plastid division and cyanobacterial cell division. To further identify new proteins that are
required for plastid division, we characterized previously and newly isolated plastid division
mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana.
Results: Leaf cells of two mutants, br04 and arc2, contain fewer, larger chloroplasts than those of
wild type. We found that ARC2 and BR04 are identical to nuclear genes encoding the plastid
chaperonin 60α (ptCpn60α) and chaperonin 60β (ptCpn60β) proteins, respectively. In both
mutants, plastid division FtsZ ring formation was partially perturbed though the level of FtsZ2-1
protein in plastids of ptcpn60β mutants was similar to that in wild type. Phylogenetic analyses
showed that both ptCpn60 proteins are derived from ancestral cyanobacterial proteins. The A.
thaliana genome encodes two members of ptCpn60α family and four members of ptCpn60β family
respectively. We found that a null mutation in ptCpn60α abolished greening of plastids and resulted
in an albino phenotype while a weaker mutation impairs plastid division and reduced chlorophyll
levels. The functions of at least two ptCpn60β proteins are redundant and the appearance of
chloroplast division defects is dependent on the number of mutant alleles.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that both ptCpn60α and ptCpn60β are required for the
formation of a normal plastid division apparatus, as the prokaryotic counterparts are required for
assembly of the cell division apparatus. Since moderate reduction of ptCpn60 levels impaired
normal FtsZ ring formation but not import of FtsZ into plastids, it is suggested that the proper
levels of ptCpn60 are required for folding of stromal plastid division proteins and/or regulation of
FtsZ polymer dynamics.

Background
All plastids trace their origins to a primary endosymbiotic
event in which a previously nonphotosynthetic protist
engulfed and enslaved a cyanobacterium. Over time, most
of the genes once present in the endosymbiont have been
lost or transferred to the host nuclear genome; those
nuclear-encoded proteins used by the plastid are translated by the host and targeted back into the organelle to
express their functions [1,2]. Consistent with this scenario, plastids are never synthesized de novo and they cannot multiply independently. Their continuity is
maintained by the division of preexisting plastids, which
is performed and controlled by proteins encoded in the
nuclear genome [3-6].
Consistent with the endosymbiotic origin of plastids,
molecular genetic studies in A. thaliana have defined several nucleus-encoded homologs of cyanobacterial cell
division proteins that function in plastid division in photosynthetic eukaryotes [7-13]. Plastid division requires
assembly of FtsZ1 and FtsZ2, homologs of the tubulinlike bacterial protein FtsZ, into a ring structure at the midplastid division site [14-16]. The FtsZ ring is localized to
the midplastid through the activities of MinD and MinE
[9-12] and is thought to be stabilized by the J-domain-like
protein ARC6 [13]. Mutations in several other cyanobacteria-derived genes, such as Giant Chloroplast 1 [17,18] and
Crumpled Leaf [19], also cause defects in plastid division,
although their roles in the division process are still not
known.
Plant-specific proteins (dynamin-related GTPase protein,
PDV1 and PDV2) also regulate chloroplast division [2022]. Division involves the assembly and constriction of
the endosymbiont-derived FtsZ ring on the stromal surface of the inner envelope membrane and the plant-specific dynamin ring on the cytosolic surface of the outer
envelope membrane. This coordination is mediated by
the outer envelope spanning proteins PDV1 and PDV2,
and inner envelope spanning protein ARC6 [23]. As
above, recent studies identified several additional components of the plastid division machinery. However, several
other proteins that are involved in bacterial cell division
[24] are not found in plants, and there are still unidentified arc (accumulation and replication of chloroplasts)
loci that impair chloroplast division in A. thaliana [25],
suggesting that there are still unidentified components of
the plastid division machinery. In order to identify new
plastid division proteins, we are using forward genetics
approaches.
By characterizing plastid division mutants, we found that
the cyanobacteria-derived chaperonin proteins ptCpn60α
and ptCpn60β are required for proper plastid division in
A. thaliana. The A. thaliana genome encodes several members of the ptCpn60α and ptCpn60β families and our

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/38

analyses suggest that at least two ptCpn60β proteins have
redundant functions. Moderate reduction of ptCpn60β
protein levels impaired plastid division while severe loss
abolished greening of plastids, suggesting that the level of
ptCpn60β is important for proper plastid division. Since
chaperonin proteins have been shown to be required for
assembly of the division apparatus in bacteria [26,27],
their activities in the division machinery are conserved
between bacteria and plastids.

Results

Mutations in ptCpn60α and ptCpn60β impair plastid
division
In order to find new proteins required for plastid division,
we screened 22,650 A. thaliana Activation Tagging Lines
[28]. By microscopic observation of leaf cell chloroplasts,
we found twenty-five mutant lines with chloroplasts that
were significantly altered in number and size within single
cells as compared with those in the wild type [29]. Among
these mutants, one line, br04, which contained enlarged
chloroplasts, was characterized in this study (ptcpn60β1-1;
Figure 1B). The growth of br04 was slightly slower than
that of the wild type while the mutant plants were fertile.
All the F1 progeny, after crossing br04 with wild type, displayed normal chloroplast morphology. In F2 progeny,
the chloroplast-division phenotype segregated in approximately a 3:1 ratio (wild type:br04). These results indicated that the chloroplast-division phenotype of br04 is
recessive and that the phenotype is caused by a mutation
in a single genomic locus.

Because the T-DNA insertion in br04 did not co-segregate
with the mutant phenotype in the F2 population, we identified the mutation by map-based cloning. br04 bears a
single nucleotide insertion in At1g55490, which encodes
a plastid chaperonin 60β (ptCpn60β1) (Figure 1G). The
nucleotide insertion produced a premature stop codon in
the second exon (Figure 1G). To confirm that the mutation in At1g55490 is linked to the chloroplast-division
phenotype, we observed another T-DNA insertion mutant
in the same gene (SAIL_852_B03; ptcpn60β1–2; Figure
1G). The mutant displayed a chloroplast-division defect
similar to that of br04 (Figure 1C). Because two independent mutant alleles of At1g55490 showed chloroplast division defects, we conclude that At1g55490 is identical to
br04 and is required for plastid division.
Supporting the above relationship between ptCpn60β and
plastid division, map-based cloning of the previously isolated chloroplast division mutant arc2 [30] revealed a
mutation in At2g28000, which encodes ptCpn60α. Leaf
mesophyll cells in arc2 mutants contain fewer and larger
chloroplasts than those in wild type cells ([30], Figure 1E),
similar to br04. The arc2 mutation bears a single nucleotide
substitution, which converts Ala-342 to Val in At2g28000
(Figure 1H). In addition, a genomic copy of At2g28000

complemented the chloroplast-division defect in arc2 (Figure 1F), indicating that ARC2 is identical to At2g28000.
These results indicate that ptCpn60α as well as ptCpn60β
proteins are required for normal plastid division.

Moderate reduction of ptCpn60α or ptCpn60β activity
causes defects in chloroplast division while severe
reduction abolishes greening
A previous study showed that a T-DNA insertion null
mutant of ptcpn60α (schlepperless, At2g28000) had a defect
in embryo development and greening of plastids [31]. In
contrast, arc2, a missense allele, germinated normally,
though it showed a dwarf phenotype later in development. br04 (At1g55490) also germinated normally, consistent with previous observations of another null allele of
At1g55490, lesion initiation 1 (len1) [32]. Although leaves
of len1 had wrinkled irregular surfaces and displayed
lesion formation under short-day conditions, under longday conditions similar to those used throughout our
study, these phenotypes were not observed and the plants
showed a dwarf phenotype similar to that of br04 [32]. We
hypothesized that the differences in phenotypes resulted
from remnant ptCpn60α activity in the case of arc2 and
redundant ptCpn60β proteins in the case of br04.

To address the above possibilities, we first analyzed
ptCpn60 proteins in A. thaliana by phylogenetic analyses.
The results showed monophyly of six A. thaliana proteins
with cyanobacterial chaperonin 60 proteins (Figure 2). Of
these, two proteins, including At2g28000, were grouped
as ptCpn60α (we named them ptCpn60α1 and
ptCpn60α2), and four proteins, including At1g55490,
were grouped as ptCpn60β (ptCpn60β1 through
ptCpn60β4). These results are consistent with a previous
classification [33]. Further, our phylogenetic analyses
indicated that there are two types of cyanobacterial chaperonin 60 proteins, GroEL-1 and GroEL-2, and that only
one group, GroEL-1, gave rise to ptCpn60α and ptCpn60β
in land plants and green algae (Figure 2).
Next, we compared the phenotypes of arc2 (a missense
allele, ptcpn60α1-1) and a T-DNA insertion mutant
(ptcpn60α1–2, SALK_006606, Figure 1H) of ptCpn60α1
(At2g28000) (Figures 3A to 3C). In contrast to arc2, seedlings of the insertion mutant exhibit an albino phenotype
and the growth of this mutant was severely suppressed
(Figure 3C), similar to that of schlepperless, another T-DNA
insertion null allele [31]. By microscopy, we observed
small and colourless plastid-like organelles in leaf cells,
but no developed chloroplasts (Figure 3C). When a
genomic fragment bearing the ptCpn60α1 (At2g28000)
gene was introduced into the mutant, the phenotype was
complemented (Figure 3D). These results indicate that
loss of ptCpn60α1 abolishes greening of plastids. In support of this conclusion, the amount of chlorophyll
extracted from true leaves of arc2 was less than that of wild
type (Figure 3E), although the arc2 cells contained green
chloroplasts that showed defects in division (Figure 3B).
The above observations of two ptcpn60α1 mutants suggest
that complete loss of ptCpn60α1 activity fully abolishes
greening of plastids while the weaker arc2 allele, though

probably retaining residual activity of ptCpn60α1, still
confers chloroplast division defects.
We addressed possible functional redundancy among
ptCpn60β proteins. The phylogenetic analyses showed
that ptCpn60β1 (br04, At1g55490) has the closest evolutionary relationship with ptCpn60β2 (At3g13470) (Figure 2) and a BLAST search showed 92% identity between
the two amino acid sequences. In order to assess whether
ptCpn60β2 protein is also required for plastid division
and/or plastid development and whether the functions of
ptCpn60β1 and ptCpn60β2 proteins are redundant, we
observed a T-DNA insertion mutant of ptCpn60β2
(SALK_014547, ptcpn60β2). Although the mutant did not
exhibit plastid division or embryo development defects
(Figures 3F7 and 3G7), the ptcpn60β1-1 (br04) ptcpn60β2
(SALK_014547) double mutant exhibited small, albino
seedlings (Figures 3F9 and 3G9), similar to the ptcpn60α1
T-DNA mutant (ptcpn60α1–2, Figure 3C). Since the
ptcpn60β1-1 (br04) and ptcpn60β2 (SALK_014547) single
mutants did not show the albino phenotype (Figures 3F3
and 3F7), the above results indicate that ptCpn60β1 and
ptCpn60β2 are redundant.
To further examine the redundancy between the two
ptCpn60β proteins with regard to plastid division and
greening, we observed all possible combinations of the
ptcpn60β1-1 and ptcpn60β2 mutations (i.e. combinations
of wild-type, heterozygous and homozygous mutations)
(Figures 3F to 3H). All combinations except the double
homozygote germinated normally (Figure 3F), while leaf
chlorophyll content was reduced depending on the
number of mutant alleles (Figure 3H).
Similar to the chlorophyll content, the plastid division
defect was dependent on the number of mutant alleles
(Figure 3G). Other than the double homozygous mutant,
all
combinations
containing
the
ptcpn60β1-1
homozygous mutation (Figures 3G3 and 3G6) and the
combination of the ptcpn60β1-1 heterozygous mutation
and ptcpn60β2 homozygous mutation (Figure 3G8)
showed a large-chloroplast phenotype, while the size and
number of chloroplasts were normal in other combinations (Figures 3G1, G2, G4, G5 and 3G7). These results
suggest that ptCpn60β1 and ptCpn60β2 have redundant
functions in plastid division. Similarly to ptcpn60α (Figures 3B and 3C), severe mutation of ptCpn60β fully abolishes greening of plastids. In contrast, weaker mutations
in ptCpn60β partially affect greening while chloroplast
division is defective even under these conditions.
ptCpn60α and ptCpn60β are required for proper FtsZ ring
formation
To confirm the reduction of ptCpn60β proteins in
ptcpn60β mutants and further examine localization of the
proteins, we prepared antibodies using recombinant

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/38

ptCpn60β1. On immunoblots, the antibodies detected a
single band of ~60 kDa, close to the predicted size of the
ptCpn60β proteins (the predicted transit peptide was
omitted for calculation of the molecular mass, Figure 4A).
When the same amount of total protein extracted from
whole plants was examined, the intensity of the band was
reduced in the ptcpn60β1-1 mutant (br04) relative to that
in the wild type. However, a residual band was detected,
similar to a previous report that anti-spinach ptCpn60β
antibodies recognized residual ptCpn60β in the
ptcpn60β1-1 mutant (len1, null mutant) [32]. The intensity of the residual band was further reduced in the
ptcpn60β1-1 ptcpn60β2 double mutant (Figure 4A), suggesting that the antibodies recognize both ptCpn60β1
and ptCpn60β2 (predicted sizes of ptCpn60β1,
ptCpn60β2, ptCpn60β3, and ptCpn60β4 without their
transit peptides are 547, 547, 567, and 574 amino acids,
respectively [33].) and confirming reduction of total
ptCpn60β protein level in these mutants. Since the antibodies still detected a faint band at the same position on
the gel in the double mutant (Figure 4A), they may also
recognize ptCpn60β3 and/or ptCpn60β4. In the immunoblot analysis, there was little difference in the intensity
of the band between wild type and ptcpn60β2. This is
probably because the ptCpn60β2 protein level is lower
than the levels of the other ptCpn60β proteins, as suggested by RT-PCR analyses showing that the ptCpn60β2
transcript level is lower than that of ptCpn60β1 (Figure
4B).
In contrast to the reduction of ptCpn60β, levels of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco)
large subunit and FtsZ2-1 were not altered in the ptcpn60β
mutants (Figure 4A). In addition, the size of FtsZ2-1 in the
mutant was the same as that of mature protein in the wild
type. These results indicate that nucleus-encoded FtsZ2-1
is properly imported into the plastids and processed in the
ptcpn60β mutants.
In order to examine the relationship between ptCpn60
proteins and chloroplast division, we first examined the
localization of ptCpn60β by immunofluorescence microscopy using the anti-ptCpn60β antibodies in the wild
type. The fluorescence signal was detected specifically in
chloroplasts but was not detected by preimmune antisera
or secondary antibodies alone (not shown). The fluorescence signal detected by the antibodies was spattered
throughout the chloroplasts and no specific localization
at the division site was observed (Figure 4C).
To assess how ptcpn60 mutations affect the chloroplast
division machinery, we examined the localization of the
chloroplast division FtsZ proteins in the ptcpn60α1-1 and
ptcpn60β1-1 mutants by immunofluorescence microscopy
using anti-AtFtsZ2-1 antibodies. In the wild type, FtsZ2-1
localizes in a single ring at the chloroplast division site as

reported previously (Figure 4B, [14]). In contrast, the
enlarged chloroplasts in both the ptcpn60β1-1 (br04) and
ptcpn60α1-1 (arc2) mutants contained abnormally long,
disordered FtsZ filaments (Figure 4C), indicating that FtsZ
ring formation is perturbed in both mutants.

Discussion
In this study, we showed that both ptCpn60α and
ptCpn60β are required for plastid division as well as for
greening of plastids. The results also indicate that the
mutant phenotypes vary depending on the severity of the
mutations. In addition to defects in plastid division,
ptCpn60 mutants exhibited dwarfed or other developmen-

tal defects [31,32] (Figure 3). A similar situation was
observed in the crumpled leaf (crl) mutant, which also
showed both plastid division defects and abnormal development [19]. Because both ptCpn60 and CRL [19] function in chloroplasts and, in our screening, several mutant
plants that showed abnormal morphology contained
chloroplasts of normal size, it is unlikely that the developmental defects are the cause of the observed chloroplast
division defects.

eronin function have been well studied mainly using the
chaperonin of Escherichia coli, GroE [34]. The GroE chaperonin functions as a large complex consisting of multiple
60-kD GroEL and 10-kD GroES subunits [34]. Although
in vitro studies have clarified the mechanism of GroEL as
a molecular chaperone, the in vivo roles are poorly understood. GroE is essential for the viability of E. coli [35] and
this is partly because GroE is required for cell wall synthesis. In addition to the cell lysis phenotype of GroEdepleted E. coli, it has been reported that cells with
impaired GroE exhibit filamentous cell morphology
owing to defects in cell division [27]. The filamentous
phenotypes were also observed in GroE-depleted Caulobacter crescentus and Streptococcus mutans, suggesting that
GroE plays a universal role in cell division in bacteria
[36,37].
Plastid Cpn60 proteins are homologs of bacterial GroEL
and phylogenetic studies indicate that plant Cpn60 proteins evolved from GroEL proteins in the cyanobacterial
ancestor of plastids ([33], Figure 2). Previous studies
showed that depletion of ptCpn60 proteins in A. thaliana
results in abnormal development of embryos and plastids
[31] and cell death in some growth conditions [32].
Although severe mutations in ptCpn60 genes resulted in
albino and dwarf seedlings, we found that weaker mutations confer defects in plastid division. Even though plastid chaperonins are expected to be involved in several
processes occurring in plastids as are bacterial chaperonins, our results suggest that one of the roles of the chaperonins is related to plastid division and that the role in
division is conserved between bacteria and plastids. It is
also known that plastid chaperonins are different from E.
coli GroE in that plastids contain two distinct proteins,
ptCpn60α and ptCpn60β, both of which are expressed in
all tissues [31,38]. Despite the difference, our results
showed that both ptCpn60α and ptCpn60β are required
for plastid division.
In our analyses, depletion of ptCpn60 proteins did not
alter the level of plastid FtsZ. The size of the FtsZ protein
in the mutants was the same as that in wild type, indicating that the transit peptide was cleaved and the protein
was imported into plastids. Both in E. coli [26] and A. thaliana chloroplasts (Figure 4B), normal FtsZ ring formation
is impaired in the respective chaperonin mutants even
though FtsZ protein levels are normal (Figure 4A). These
results suggest that ptCpn60 proteins are not required for
import of plastid division proteins into plastids. Rather, it
is suggested that ptCpn60s are required for assembly and/
or maintenance of the plastid division apparatus after
import of the components into plastids [8-10,13]. However, the mechanistic basis of the chloroplast division
defect remains unclear. The abnormally long, disorganized FtsZ filaments observed in the ptcpn60 mutants
resemble the reported FtsZ2 localization patterns in an

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/38

ftsZ1 null mutant [39], an ftsZ1 antisense line [14], and in
a line overexpressing ARC6, which functions in part to stabilize FtsZ polymers [13]. The ptcpn60 FtsZ morphologies
are distinct from those observed in minD [40] (multiple
closed FtsZ rings with multiple constriction), minE [40],
arc6 [13] (many fragmented short FtsZ filaments), pdv1,
pdv2 and arc5 [22] (multiple rings or spirals at the constriction site) mutants. The mutant phenotypes suggest
that reduced ptCpn60 levels result in excessively stable
FtsZ filaments, though whether this is through a direct
effect on FtsZ or a regulator of FtsZ assembly, and whether
the effects result from misfolding of some proteins in the
mutant backgrounds or loss of another activity of
ptCpn60, remain to be determined. Whatever the mechanism, the results provided evidence of a role for the
ptCpn60 chaperone system in the regulation of FtsZ polymer dynamics in vivo.
We compared the effects of several combinations of
ptCpn60β alleles. The appearance of the chloroplast division phenotype depends on the number of disrupted alleles of ptcpn60β. For example, chloroplast size and number
in the ptcpn60β1-1 heterozygote and ptcpn60β2 homozygote were normal, but combining these alleles
(ptcpn60β1-1 heterozygous ptcpn60β2 homozygous
mutant) impaired chloroplast division (Figure 3G8). The
lack of an obvious phenotype in ptcpn60β2 is probably
because the level of total ptCpn60β decreased little in this
mutant (Figure 4C). The results suggest that ptCpn60β1
and ptCpn60β2 have redundant functions and that the
plastid division defects in the ptcpn60β mutants are due to
decreased ptCpn60β dosage. Thus far, several plastid division proteins of cyanobacterial origin, such as FtsZ, MinD,
MinE, ARC6, and GC1, were identified [7-13,17]. Studies
showing that the stoichiometry among these proteins is
tightly maintained in plants [41] and that moderate loss
or overexpression of FtsZ, MinD and MinE impairs plastid
division [11,42,43] suggest that normal plastid division
requires the presence of the proper stoichiometric relationship among plastid division proteins. The observed
defects in plastid division in a series of ptcpn60β mutants
even in the presence of wild type ptCpn60β alleles (Figure
3G) may reflect disruption of the stoichiometric relationship of functional plastid division proteins due to misfolding in the mutants after import from the cytosol.
Studies using E. coli showed preferential localization of a
population of GroEL at division sites by immunofluorescence labelling [26]. In our immunofluorescence analyses, however, ptCpn60β proteins are spattered throughout
the chloroplasts of A. thaliana and we could not observe
predominant localization of the protein at the division
site. This observation is perhaps because of the existence
of several chloroplast proteins which require Cpn60 proteins for their folding. In fact, many proteins other than
division proteins have been identified as possible targets
Page 8 of 12

BMC Plant Biology 2009, 9:38

of bacterial GroEL as below. Despite of this observation, it
is still possible that a portion of the ptCpn60 pool interacts with the plastid division machinery. A study in E. coli
further suggested that the division protein FtsE is a target
substrate of the GroE system [27]. In contrast, FtsE is missing in plant and algal genomes [44], suggesting that the
plastid Cpn60 system targets a different plastid division
substrate(s). Proteome-based analyses in E. coli identified
~300 proteins that interact with GroE, including the cell
division proteins FtsE, FtsA, FtsI, and FtsZ [45-47]
although GroE-dependent folding of FtsA, FtsI, and FtsZ
has not been examined. Of these, only FtsZ is conserved
in plant genomes, raising the possibility that FtsZ might
be a target of Cpn60 in the plastid.
Several other molecular chaperone proteins have been
shown to function in plastids, such as HSP100 [48] and
HSP70 [49], but there is limited information about their
substrates [50]. Although it is known that functional specificity of Hsp70 is mediated by specialized co-chaperones, how and what kinds of proteins GroE/Cpn60
recognize in vivo is little understood [51]. Further studies
on the interaction between GroEL and plastid division
proteins in vivo, such as co-immunoprecipitation and
FRET analyses, would shed light on the role of ptCpn60 in
the assembly and/or maintenance of the plastid division
machinery.

Conclusion
Our results show that cyanobacteria-derived ptCpn60α
and ptCpn60β proteins are required for plastid division.
FtsZ ring formation in plastids, but not import of FtsZ into
the plastids, was perturbed in ptcpn60a and ptcpn60β
mutants, suggesting that ptCpn60 proteins are required
for assembly of the cyanobacteria-derived part of the plastid division machinery subsequent to import of plastid
division proteins, all of which are encoded in the nucleus.
Although plants have several members of the ptCpn60α
and ptCpn60β family, we found that moderate reduction
of ptCpn60 level results in impaired plastid division and
reduction of chlorophylls. The results suggest the existence of mechanisms that regulate the levels of the
ptCpn60 family of proteins in plastids.

Methods
Plant Materials and Growth Conditions
The T-DNA insertion lines SAIL_852_B03 and
SALK_014547 were provided by the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC). Seeds were surface-sterilized,
sown on Murashige and Skoog agar plates, and stratified
at 4°C for 48 h in the dark before germination. All plants
were grown in growth chambers under white fluorescent
light (a cycle of 16-h light/8-h dark) at 21°C. Seedlings
were transferred to soil 2 to 4 weeks after germination and
were grown under the same conditions.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/38

Isolation of br04 Mutant
A. thaliana Activation Tagging Lines ([28]; provided by
RIKEN BioResource Center) were germinated and grown for
3 weeks as described above. Tips of expanding leaves were
cut and chloroplasts were observed with Nomarski differential interference optics. Among 22,650 lines observed, the
size and number of chloroplasts were significantly altered in
25 lines compared to those in the wild type [29]. One recessive mutant was analyzed further in this study.
Map-Based Cloning of br04 and arc2
The br04 and arc2 [30] mutations were mapped with
molecular markers based on a cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence [52] and simple sequence length polymorphisms [53]. We used some markers listed on The
Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR; http://
www.arabidopsis.org); other markers were designed
based on polymorphisms listed at TAIR http://www.arabi
dopsis.org/Cereon/ in the Monsanto SNP and Ler
Sequence Collection.

The BR04 (Col-0 background) homozygous mutant was
crossed with Landsberg erecta wild-type plants to generate a
mapping population. Analyses using 24 F2 progeny with
the br04 phenotype showed that the mutation is located in
a region of 1.26 Mb on chromosome 1 (between polymorphisms CER 458759 and CER 460336). Using 600 F2
plants, we fine-mapped the br04 mutation to a 112 kb
region on chromosome 1, which contains 28 genes
(between polymorphisms CER 479886 and CER 446782).
The br04 mutation was found in At1g55490 by sequencing.
arc2 (Ler background) was crossed with Col-0 wild-type
plants to generate a mapping population of 308 F2
mutants identified based on their pale phenotype and
enlarged chloroplasts. The pale phenotype was confirmed
by measuring relative chlorophyll levels in planta using a
Minolta SPAD-502 chlorophyll meter [54]. We mapped
the arc2 locus to a 129 kb region on chromosome 2,
which contains 18 genes. The arc2 mutation was found in
At2g28000 by sequencing.
DNA Constructs and Plant Transformation
For the arc2 complementation construct, a genomic fragment containing the annotated ARC2 open reading frame
flanked by 1.2 kb at the 5' end and 0.4 kb at the 3' end was
amplified by PCR using the primers 5'-CGTTTCAATCACAACCACTCA-3'
and
5'-AGTGGTTCCAACGAGTCTGA-3'. A gel-purified fragment was cloned into
pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega), excised with NotI, and
then transferred into pMLBART [14]. The final construct
was transformed into arc2 plants.

All constructs were transferred to Agrobacterium tumefaciens and introduced into A. thaliana plants as described

[22]. T1 plants were selected by resistance to glufosinate
and used for further analyses.
Microscopy
For observation of chloroplast size, tips from expanding
leaves were cut and fixed with 3.5% glutaraldehyde in
water for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated in
0.1 M Na2-EDTA pH 9.0, for 30 min at 55°C. Samples
were analyzed with Nomarski differential interference
contrast optics.

Localization of ptCpn60β and FtsZ2-1 was examined by
immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-ptCpn60β
and anti-FtsZ2-1 antibodies as described [14].
Phylogenetic analyses
Deduced amino acid sequences encoded by the 82 GroEL
and Cpn60 genes (gi numbers or locus IDs are indicated in
Figure 2 and Additional file 1) were aligned using CLUSTAL W [55] and the alignment was refined manually.
Gaps were deleted and 490 conserved sites were used for
the phylogenetic analyses. Bayesian inference was performed with the program MrBayes version 3.1.2 [56] with
WAG+I+G4 model. For the MrBayes consensus trees,
1,000,000 generations were completed with trees sampled each 1,000 cycles. Maximum likelihood trees were
constructed using RaxML version 7.0.4 [57] with the WAG
matrix of amino acid replacements assuming a proportion
of invariant positions and four gamma-distributed rates
(WAG+I+G4 model). The local bootstrap probability of
each branch was calculated by 100 replications.
Measurement of chlorophyll content
Chlorophyll was extracted from true leaves of ~5 week-old
plants in chilled 80% acetone. Chlorophyll content was
measured spectrophotometrically as described [58].
Analyses of gene expression by RT-PCR
Total RNA of A. thaliana was extracted from ~3 week-old
plants using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). DNase-treated
RNA was reverse-transcribed with oligo dT (15) primer,
and the resulting cDNA was used as template for PCR. The
same regions (the same size) of the ptCpn60β1 and
ptCpn60β2 cDNAs were simultaneously amplified by the
same primer set (5'-AAGCTCTCTGGTGGAGTTGC-3' and
5'-CCTGAGTTGTCCATTGGGTT-3'). In order to distinguish the two products, amplified cDNA was treated with
ClaI, which cuts ptCpn60β1 but not ptCpn60β2 because of
a polymorphism between the two sequences.

5'-CCGTTTCAATATTAGCCTATCTCCTC-3'. A gel-purified
fragment was cloned into the TOPO cloning vector (Invitrogen) and 6 × His fusion polypeptides were expressed in
Escherichia coli, purified and used as antigens. AntiptCpn60β was affinity-purified from antisera using the
recombinant ptCpn60β coupled to a HisTrap NHS-activated HP (GE Healthcare).
SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were carried out as
described previously [22].
