Abstract
Background: This study explored co-receptor usage and prediction of V3 genotyping algorithms in HIV-1 subtype
B’ from paid blood donors experienced anti-retroviral therapy in Chinese central province in order to design
effectively therapeutic regimen.
Methods: HIV-1 strains were isolated in treatment HIV-1 infections and treatment-naïve HIV-1 infections, then coreceptor usage of HIV-1 strains was identified based on Ghost cell lines using flow cytometry. HIV-1 V3 region was
amplified and submitted into web-server (WebPSSM and geno2pheno) to predict HIV-1 co-receptor usage. The
feasibility of prediction HIV-1 usage with Web-server assay was analyzed by comparing prediction of V3 genotyping
algorithms with HIV phenotype assay based on Ghost cell line.
Results: 45 HIV-1 strains and 114 HIV-1 strains were isolated from HIV-1 infections exposed anti-retroviral therapy
and treatment-naïve, respectively. 41% clinical viruses from ART patients and 18% from treatment-naïve patients
used CXCR4 as co-receptor. The net charge in the V3 loop was significantly difference in both groups. The
sensitivity and specificity for predicting co-receptor capacity is 54.6% and 90.0% on 11/25 rule, 50.0% and 90% on
Web-PSSMx4r5, 68.2% and 40.0% on Geno2pheno[co-receptor].
Conclusion: Dual/mixed/X4 co-receptor utilization was higher in ART patients than treatment-naïve patients. It is
should paid attention to predicting HIV-1 co-receptor usage based on V3 genotyping algorithms in HIV-1 subtype
B’ from paid blood donors experienced anti-retroviral therapy in Chinese central province.

Background
HIV-1 enters a host cell using the CD4 receptor and coreceptors including the CXCR4 and/or CCR5. In general,
R5-tropic strains using CCR5 as co-receptor are responsible for the early stage of infection, while mixed or dualtropic R5/X4 strains using both CXCR4 and CCR5 as
co-receptor, and X4 using CXCR4 co-receptor are
detected in more advanced disease stages, and are believed
to be associated with more rapid CD4 + T cell decline and
accelerate disease progression to AIDS[1]. However the
X4 viruses usually coexist with R5 viruses in the viral

swarm[2]. There are still 50% patients with late stage HIV1 B infection having only R5 viruses detectable in treatment-naïve HIV-1 patients[3] but not other HIV-1
subtypes [4,5]. The mechanisms that prompt the evolution
towards CXCR4 strains from CCR5 strains are not fully
understood. Meanwhile, there were different point of
views about HIV-1 co-receptor usage after the patients
experienced highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).
After HAART therapy (59 months [6-240 months]), HIV1 co-receptor usage was fairly stable[6]. But, some drugs
are duty to the preferential suppression of CXCR4-special
strains of HIV-1[7].
The third variable loop (V3) sequence of HIV envelope
is the major domain associated with HIV co-receptor
usage[8]. In general, when the amino acids at codons 11

and/or 25 within the V3 loop is positive charged, the HIV
strains usually use CXCR4 as co-receptor. Therefore the
11/25 charge rule is a simple genotypic method to be
predicted HIV co-receptor usage. Subsequently, several
genotyping algorithms based on V3 loop for predicting
HIV co-receptor usage have been published, such as
neural networks(NN), decision tree support vector
machines(SVM)[9], Position Specific Scoring Matrix
approach (PSSM)[10]. However, it reports that current
V3 genotyping algorithms are inadequate for predicting
X4 co-receptor usage in clinical isolates[11].
Since the first co-receptor antagonist——Maraviroc
against HIV-1 was approved in the United States in
2007, which blocking HIV-1gp120 from binding to
CCR5, thereby preventing HIV-1 into the host cell. It
could effectively inhibit CCR5-tropic strain but not
CXCR4-tropic strain, and is a promising agent for treatment-experienced patients infected with multidrug-resistant CCR5 strain[12]. It is necessary to know HIV-1 coreceptor usage before Maraviroc is applied to clinical.
Therefore, we collected HIV-1 infections experiencing
treatment with reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and isolated HIV-1 strains from HIV-1 infections to evaluate
the feasibility that predictes HIV-1 co-receptor usage
based on V3 genotyping algorithms.

Results
Clinical and general characterization of subjects and viral
subtype

45 HIV-1 strains were isolated in treatment HIV-1infection from Anhui (22 strains) and Henan (23 strains)
provinces. The mean age was 41 years (26-61 years), 25
(60%) of them was women, 17(40%) male. The mean
CD4 + T count was 169 (7-901) per μl of whole blood,
while the mean plasma viral load (VL) was 4.9(2.7-6.6)
log10 HIV-1 RNA copies per ml. The mean treatment
time was 26 (6-48 months), of which 23 (51%) patients
were from Henan, treatment regimen for the AZT +
DDI + NVP; 22 (49%) were from Anhui, treatment regimen for D4T + DDI + NVP (see table 1). All the HIV-1
strains were HIV-1 subtype B’ (Thai B, a subset of subtype B) through phylogenetic analysis of V3 region gene.
The phylogenetic tree showed that they are close to B.
FR.HXB2 (HIV-1 subtype B) and closer to B.CN.RL42
(Thai B’, a clade of HIV-1 B) (see Figure 1).
114 subtype HIV-1 B’ strains were isolated in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infections in Anhui province. Their
mean age was 43 years (26-67 years old), of which 42
(36%) were women, male 72 (64%). The CD4 + T count
was 354 (6-917) per μl of whole blood, and the VL was
4.7(2.6-7.5)log10 HIV-1 RNA copies per ml(see table 1).
All patients were infected by HIV-1 subtype B’ variants
through phylogenetic analysis of HIV-1 gene sequence
[3,13,14].

Association of HIV-1 co-receptor usage with clinical
characteristics

Compared with treatment-naive participants, a higher
percentage of HIV-1 strains in treated participants were
harboring dual/mixed/X4-tropic viruses (51.1% vs. 18%)
(See table 2). To further analyze association of HIV-1
co-receptor usage with clinical characteristics, CD4 + T
cell count or VL was stratified and the discrepancy was
analyzed using the Mantel-Haenszel test. After adjusted
by CD4 + T cell count or VL, the HIV-1 co-receptor
usage was difference between treatment-naïve and ART
group(p < 0.05; see table 2). HIV-1 X4 co-receptor
usage utilization has higher percentage in ART group
than treatment-naïve group, and increased with CD4 +
T cell count decrease and with VL increase (Figure 2).
In treatment groups, there is no association between
HIV-1 co-receptor usage and therapeutic regimens (p >
0.05). Also, when treatment time was stratified (treatment time < 18 months as a group, 18 months = <
treatment time < 30 months as second group, and treatment > = 30 months as the third group), there was no
evidence for association between treatment time and
HIV-1 co-receptor usage (P > 0.05)(see table 2).
Association of HIV-1 co-receptor usage with V3 loop
sequence

81 sequences of V3 region from the 114 treatment-naïve
patients and 42 sequence of V3 region from 45 ART
patients were amplified. According to the formula (V3
net charge = (R + K)-(D + E)), net charge of V3 loop
was calculated. In the formula, the R and K was short
for argentine and lysine, respectively; D and E short for
aspartic acid and glutamic acid, respectively. In the ART
group, the net charge of V3 loop was distributed from 2
to 7(4.33 ± 1.34), of which 4.86 ± 1.25 for X4/R5 strain,
3.75 ± 1.21 for the R5 strain. In the treatment-naïve

group, net charge of V3 was distributed from 2 to 7(4.02
± 1.02), of which 4.53 ± 0.74 for X4/R5 strain, 3.91 ±
1.05 for R5 strain (see table 3).
In both ART and treatment-naïve group, number of
net charge of V3 for R5-tropic viruses distributed mainly
below 4, which frequency is more than 70%. However,
number of net charge of V3 for X4-tropic viruses distributed mainly above 4 in treatment-naïve group, above
5 in ART group (see table 3).

HIV-1 co-receptor usage was predicted based on genotypic algorithm including 11/25 charge rule, Webserver
(Web-PSSM x4r5 and Geno2pheno [coreceptor] ), which is
called HIV-1 co-receptor genotype. The consistency
between genotype and phenotype of co-receptor usage
was evaluated among ART population. The sensitivity
and specificity for predicting X4 capacity is 54.6% and
90.0% on 11/25 rule, 50.0% and 90% on Web-PSSMx4r5,
68.2% and 40.0% on Geno2pheno[coreceptor](see table 4).

Discussion
In 1993, HIV-1 infection of paid blood donors in the
central Chinese province of Henan and Anhui provinces
constitutes a major epidemic in China[15]. In September
2003, the “Four Frees and One Care” policy was implemented, which provided free antiretroviral drugs in
above areas[16]. In this article, we report that a largescale study of HIV-1 co-receptor usage and their prediction based on V3 genotyping algorithms in population
who were infected by paid blood donors in Henan and
Anhui province. However, there is limited information
to know X4-to-R5 switch of HIV-1 in this population
after antiviral therapy. Therefore, the present study was
based on the characterization of specimens collected
from 45 subjects experienced ART and 114 treatmentnaïve subjects between 2005 and 2008. All the viruses
isolated from ART and treatment-naïve population in
this study are HIV-1 B’ subtype. The combination of B’
viral subtype and Chinese host’s genetic background has
likely provided a unique situation for the understanding
of HIV-1 co-receptor usage and their prediction based
on V3 genotyping algorithms in a particular population
who infected though paid blood donation and then
experienced ART.
In present study, co-receptor usage of HIV-1 in
patients with and without treatment on HAART was
detected based on Ghost cell lines (phenotypic assays).
The results showed that the HIV-1 CXCR4 utilization
among antiretroviral therapy HIV-1 infected patients
was higher than in the treatment-naïve population,

implying that it should pay attention to the choice of
co-receptor antagonists after the treatment failure on
HAART. The present study was in agreement with
Hunt’s results that there is more widely X4-tropism
strain in antiretroviral-experienced patients[17]. When
CD4 + T cell count or VL was stratified, the HIV-1 coreceptor usage was difference between treatment-naïve
and ART group. HIV-1 CXCR4 utilization has higher
percentage in ART group than treat-naïve group, and
increased with CD4 + T cell count decrease and with
VL increase in both group. Usually, the CXCR4 utilization is higher in more advanced disease stages. There is
a report that some drugs are duty to the preferential
suppression of CXCR4-special strains of HIV-1[7], However, the frequency of CXCR4 utilization in the two
therapeutic regimens (AZT + DDI + NVP or D4T +
DDI + NVP) is no difference in our study, This study
could not found any association between treatment time
with CXCR4 utilization, which agreed with other report
[6]. HIV-1 R5 to X4 switch is dynamic processes during
the interaction between HIV-1 variation and host
immune. Of course, it does not exclude the reason that
the criterion that the participants in ART group would
initiate antiretroviral therapy is that their CD4 + T
counts must be blow 200 cells/μl in China.
Number of net charge of V3 plays an important role
in detecting viral R5-to X4 co-receptor switch. 70% R5tropic viral net charge of V3 distributed below 4 whatever exposed to drug or not. However, there is more
than 60% for X4-tropic viruses which number of net
charge of V3 distributes mainly above 4 in treatmentnaïve group, above 5 in ART group, For exception,
there is not any X4-tropic viruses which the number of
net charge of V3 is below 4 in treatment-naïve group,
whereas there is 18.2% X4-tropic viruses which the
number of net charge of V3 is below 4 in ART group,
suggesting the number of net charge of V3 is not available for co-receptor prediction of HIV-1 B’ subtype
exposed to drug.
V3 loop, as the major determinant of viral tropism, is
a base of lots of prediction essays of co-receptor usage,

Qu et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:280

for example, networks(NN), decision tree[9], support
vector machines(SVM) [9], Position Specific Scoring
Matrix approach (PSSM)[10]. In this study, PSSMx4/r5,
geno2pheno[coreceptor] and 11/25 charge rule were chosen to assess the concordance with phenotype assay.
The specificities and sensitivities in our study is lower
than Garrido’s study that the specificities for detecting
HIV-1 B X4 variants are 92%(PSSM x4/r5 ), 88%(geno2pheno[coreceptor]), and the sensitivities are 90%(PSSMx4/
r5) and 90% (geno2pheno[coreceptor])[18], but higher than
Whitcomb’s study that the specificities for detecting
HIV-1 B X4 variants are more than 90%(PSSMx4/r5, geno2pheno[coreceptor], 11/25rule). And the sensitivities are
merely 30.5%(11/25rule), 24.5%(PSSMx4/r5) and 44.7%
(geno2pheno[coreceptor])[11]. The reason for this difference is different method for detecting HIV-1 co-receptor phenotype. Anyway, all the studys reach an
agreement that current V3 genotyping algorithms are
inadequate for predicting X4 co-receptor usage in clinical isolates.

HIV-1 isolation from patients’ PBMCs

Primary HIV-1 strains were isolated by co-culturing
PBMCs from infected individual and those from two or
more from healthy individuals after phytohaemagglutinin(PHA)-stimulation. The co-culture was incubated in
growth RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10%
fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml
streptomycin, 2.9 mg/ml L-glutamine and 100 IU
recombinant IL-2 (Roche Diagnostic,Sigma) as previously described[19]. Cultures were maintained by regular addition of uninfected stimulated PBMCs and fresh
media. Culture supernatants were collected once a week
to measure p24 production levels using a commercial
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit
according to the instructions from the manufacturer
(BioMerieux, Marcy-l’Etoile, France). Virus culture
supernatants with p24 consentations higher than 2 ng/
ml were aliquoted and stored in liquid nitrogen until
being used.
Detection of HIV-1 co-receptor usage

Conclusions
In summary, the study shows that prevalence of dual/
mixed/X4 HIV-1 strain among ART participants is
higher than among treatment-naïve participants. V3
genotyping algorithms for predicting HIV-1 co-receptor
usage is not enough for HIV-1 B’ subtype from patients
experienced ART.
Methods
Study population

All the subjects were recruited from HIV-1 infected
former blood/plasma donors (FBDs)[13] in the central
China. The population with experienced antiretroviral
therapies were pre-selected HIV-1-infected patients,
who participated in a multicenter AIDS Cohort Study
in Anhui and Henan provinces of China during 20052008. While the HIV-1 infections without treatment
was selected from Anhui province, who were
recruited as cohort study of CIPRA (Comprehensive
International Program of Research on AIDS) in 20052007.
The blood from all the subjects was collected for viral
load, CD4 + T count detection and the peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for isolating primary HIV
strains. All subjects signed informed consent forms
before blood collection. This study was approved by the
Institutional Research Ethics Committee of Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention in China. The
viral load were tested with COBAS AMPLICOR™ techniques and Analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Alameda, CA).
The count of CD4 + T and CD8 + T lymphocytes was
performed by flow cytometry (EPICS-XL, Coulter) with
TruCount package from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA).

GHOST cells, expressing CD4 while expressing CXCR4
or CCR5, were seeded in 24-well plates (Corning Inc,
Spain) at the density of 1×105 cells/well*0.5 ml. On the
following day, the monolayers, about 70% confluent, were
infected with virus stocks (200 μl/well) in the presence of
8 μg/ml DEAE-dxtran to enhance the infective efficiency.
After 48 hours, cells were harvested and analyzed with
flow cytometer (Elite ESP, Beckman Coulter, Germany)
and a total of 10,000 to 15,000 events were scored. We
expected an approximately 10 fold shift in mean GFP
fluorescence of infected cells over uninfected cell[20].
The Ghost-R5 and -X4 cells infected with HIV-1 SF33 ,
HIV-1 Ba-L and HIV-1IIIB were positive controls and the
cells without HIV-1 infection were negative control.
Amplification for HIV-1 V3 loop

RNA was extracted from HIV isolates using a RNA Mini
Kit (QIAGEN, Germany). Nested polymerase chain reaction was used to sequence the V3 region using the
external primers 44F/35R(5’-ACAGTRCARTGYACACATGG-3’/5’-CACTTCTCCAATTGTCCITCA-3), and
the internal primers 33F/48R(5’-CTGTTIAATGGCAGICTAGC-3’/5’-RATGGGAGGRGYATACAT-3’). The
responsive and cycling parameters were set according to
the Takara Ex Taq PCR kit’s specification. The PCR
products were purified (Gel Extraction Kit, QIAGEN,
USA) and then were done for sequencing on an ABI
377 Sequencer (Applied Biosciences) and analyzed
sequence using Mega soft[21].
Bioinformatic prediction

After alignment, sequences with positively charged
amino acids at codons 11 and/or 25 within the V3 loop

Qu et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:280
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/280

were classified as having an 11/25 genotype. Then the
HIV-1 strain with 11/25 genotype was believed as
CXCR4 or CXCR4/CCR5 strain.
Based on HIV-1 V3 loop sequence, HIV-1 co-receptor
usage were analyzed using published genotypic algorithm such as PSSMX4/R5 http://indra.mullins.microbiol.washington.edu/webpssm/[22], and geno2pheno
[coreceptor] http://coreceptor.bioinf.mpi-inf.mpg.de/[23].
Statistical analysis

In this study, age, CD4 + T count and treatment time
was indication as mean or median and range, and virus
load was transformed to log10. The age, CD4 + T count
or VL difference between ART and treatment-naïve
were performed by using T test, and the distribution of
gender between two groups was performed by using chi
square test. All the statistical analysis was done on SPSS
software (V13.0), and a P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
