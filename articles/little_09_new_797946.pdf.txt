Abstract
Canine hepatozoonosis is caused by Hepatozoon canis and Hepatozoon americanum, apicomplexan
parasites transmitted to dogs by ingestion of infectious stages. Although the two agents are
phylogenetically related, specific aspects, including characteristics of clinical disease and the natural
history of the parasites themselves, differ between the two species. Until recently, H. canis infections
had not been clearly documented in North America, and autochthonous infection with H. americanum
has yet to be reported outside of the southern United States. However, recent reports
demonstrate H. canis is present in areas of North America where its vector tick, Rhipicephalus
sanguineus, has long been endemic, and that the range of H. americanum is likely expanding along
with that of its vector tick, Amblyomma maculatum; co-infections with the two organisms have also
been identified. Significant intraspecific variation has been reported in the 18S rRNA gene sequence
of both Hepatozoon spp.-infecting dogs, suggesting that each species may represent a complex of
related genogroups rather than well-defined species. Transmission of H. americanum to dogs via
ingestion of cystozoites in muscle of infected vertebrates was recently demonstrated, supporting
the concept of predation as a means of natural transmission. Although several exciting advances
have occurred in recent years, much remains to be learned about patterns of infection and the
nature of clinical disease caused by the agents of canine hepatozoonosis in North America.

Background
Hepatozoon canis has long been recognised to infect and
cause disease in dogs in Asia, southern Europe, the

Middle East, Africa and South America. In 1978, cases of
hepatozoonosis were recognised for the first time in the
southern United States and initially attributed to a more

pathogenic strain of H. canis [1]. However, subsequent
work demonstrated that the causative agent was a distinct
species, H. americanum, and the disease induced became
known as American canine hepatozoonosis [2-6]. The life
cycle of both H. canis and H. americanum involves a tickdefinitive host, where fertilisation, oocyst formation and
sporogony occur, and a canine or other mammalian intermediate host, in which merogony and gamont formation
occurs [7]. Gamonts are acquired by ticks during feeding,
but sporozoites are released to infect the intermediate
host only upon ingestion of the infected tick itself [8].
Although somewhat similar in overall life cycle, the two
Hepatozoon spp. reported from dogs differ in several ways,
including aspects of the clinical disease they cause in
dogs, the species of tick used as a definitive host and their
geographic distribution.

Clinical features of canine hepatozoonoses
Dogs with American canine hepatozoonosis present with
severe, febrile disease characterised by lethargy, myalgia,
lameness and mucopurulent ocular discharge. Radiographs may reveal periosteal proliferation of long bones.
A profound neutrophilic leukocytosis is often present, but
gamonts are only rarely found in blood smears [9]. In
contrast, dogs with canine hepatozoonosis caused by
H. canis are often clinically normal or develop only mild
disease. With high parasitemia or in cases of co-infection
with other tick-borne disease agents, dogs with H. canis
may develop mild to severe clinical disease characterised
by fever, lethargy and emaciation. Osteoproliferative
lesions are only rarely described with H. canis infection
[10], and thus radiographs are usually unremarkable.
Leukocyte counts are also usually normal or only slightly
elevated, and gamonts are numerous, infecting as many as
100% of neutrophils observed [7].

Tick vectors and geographic distribution of agents
Hepatozoon americanum
The definitive host and tick vector of H. americanum is
Amblyomma maculatum, the Gulf Coast tick, which in
North America was historically limited to areas along the
Gulf Coast and southern Atlantic coast [11]. This tick has
also been reported from Central America and northern
South America [12]. Reports of H. americanum infection
in dogs outside of the U.S. are lacking, although one
survey of wildlife described an 18S rDNA sequence 97%
similar to that of H. americanum from a crab-eating fox
from Brazil [13]. In recent decades, the range of
A. maculatum has expanded northward with populations
now established in areas of Oklahoma, Kansas, Kentucky
and some other states [12,14]. In addition, H. americanum
has been reported from California, Washington and
Vermont [15], states outside the recognised range of the
tick vector, presumably due to relocation of infected dogs
from endemic areas.

Hepatozoon canis
The main vector of H. canis is Rhipicephalus sanguineus, the
brown dog tick, although other ticks have also been
reported as hosts [16-20]. Rhipicephalus sanguineus is
found in temperate and tropical regions worldwide, and
cases of H. canis have been reported from southern
Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East and South America
[7]. However, prior to 2008, H. canis had not been
definitively identified in dogs or wild canids in North
America. Since that time, H. canis has been confirmed in
30 dogs in the United States by PCR, 14 of which were
also infected with H. americanum [15,21], and identified
in 5 dogs on the Caribbean island of Grenada [22].
Gamonts, presumably H. canis, were also identified on
blood smear from one dog from the U.S. that had been
PCR-confirmed as infected with H. canis, but not
H. americanum [15]. Infection has also been identified by
sequence-confirmed PCR in a grey fox from Georgia
(M. Yabsley, pers. comm.), further supporting the
interpretation that this organism is present and actively
transmitted to canids in North America.

Intraspecific variation
The only Hepatozoon species described from dogs to date
are H. canis and H. americanum; both have variation in
reported 18S rRNA gene sequences [21,23]. Although
complete sequence data is available from only 2 dogs,
identity among the 18S rDNA fragments reported from
dogs infected with H. americanum ranges from 92.7-99.6%
[21]. Among H. canis sequences, the identity reported is
97-100% [21,23]. Although strain variations likely
account for the differences in sequence of 18S rRNA gene,
the genogroup clusters from the sequence data available
to date do not appear to correspond with geographic
location of the dogs or severity of disease seen (data not
shown). Acquisition of larger data sets with detailed
information on clinical and travel history of the dogs will
be necessary to more fully understand the significance, if
any, of the sequence variation seen.

Novel transmission routes
In both the H. canis and H. americanum systems, dogs
have been shown capable of infecting immature ticks with
gamonts that develop to infectious oocysts and are able to
infect a new dog upon ingestion [24]. For H. canis, dogs
are likely the preeminent reservoir host because the
preferred vector tick, R. sanguineus, feeds preferentially on
dogs in all three active life stages [25]. A variety of species
of fox have also been reported infected with H. canis [13],
and thus wild canids may play a role in maintaining a
source of infection in nature. In contrast, immature
A. maculatum are more frequently found feeding on
ground-dwelling birds, rodents and rabbits than on
canids, although all three stages have been reported from
coyotes [11]. Infection of wild coyotes with H. americanum

in A. maculatum-endemic areas has been documented
[26,27]. Coyotes have been shown to be experimentally
susceptible to infection and disease and are capable of
infecting immature ticks [27,28]. However, the predominance of immature A. maculatum on other vertebrate
species led to persistent questions about the role hosts
other than canids may play in creating a source of
infection for ticks [6,9].
Results from recent experiments confirm the validity of
these suspicions. Ingestion of H. americanum sporozoites
was shown to lead to the development of cystozoites in
muscle tissue of cotton rats [29]. Muscle from infected
rats was infectious to a dog, inducing the characteristic
clinical disease of American canine hepatozoonosis [30].
Similar experiments with H. americanum in the past using
muscle from infected dogs failed to result in transmission
[2,31], and although monozoic cysts have been described
in dogs infected with H. canis [32], to our knowledge no
feeding experiments to evaluate their infectivity have been
reported. Despite testing a number of animals in endemic
areas, naturally occurring infection with H. americanum in
wild rodents, rabbits or vertebrates other than canids has
not yet been demonstrated ([33]; K. Allen, unpub. data),
but evidence is mounting to support the role of wild
vertebrates as an important paratenic host for this
parasite. Transplacental infection has also been shown to
occur with H. canis [34], but this transmission route has
not been seen in H. americanum.

Conclusions
Although these new data are exciting, many important
questions remain about canine hepatozoonosis in North
America. The variation in 18S rDNA sequence reported
from infected dogs suggests that multiple strains or
species of Hepatozoon, which could vary in their pathogenicity and life history patterns, may be infecting and
causing disease in dogs [21]. Discovery of an infectious
cystozoite stage in rodents suggests vertebrates other than
canids could prove to be important in maintaining
H. americanum infections in nature by serving as paratenic
hosts that infect dogs through predation [29,30]; the
ability of other vertebrates to infect immature ticks
remains to be determined, as does the role, if any, of the
monozoic cyst form described in dogs with H. canis [32]
in transmitting infection. In addition, defining the extent
to which H. canis infects dogs in North America is of great
interest. In contrast to those caused by H. americanum,
H. canis infections are often clinically inapparent,
particularly in otherwise healthy dogs [7], and thus this
agent may be more common in dogs in this region than
currently realised. The presence of a number of other
endemic tick-borne infections, including anaplasmosis,
babesiosis, borreliosis, ehrlichiosis and Rocky Mountain
spotted fever [35-37], provides ample opportunity for co-

infection and more severe disease. The agents of
hepatozoonosis, like those of other vector-borne diseases,
present international challenges; these important questions can be addressed only through sustained collaboration between veterinarians and parasitologists
worldwide with expertise in H. canis and H. americanum.

This work reviews recent findings from a collaborative
effort among researchers at Oklahoma State University
that identify and characterise Hepatozoon sp. infections in
dogs and other animals with molecular techniques (SEL,
KEA) and classical studies to describe lesions and parasite
