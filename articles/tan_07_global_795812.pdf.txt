Abstract
Background: Nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeat (NBS-LRR)-encoding genes comprise the largest class of plant
disease resistance genes. The 149 NBS-LRR-encoding genes and the 58 related genes that do not encode LRRs represent
approximately 0.8% of all ORFs so far annotated in Arabidopsis ecotype Col-0. Despite their prevalence in the genome
and functional importance, there was little information regarding expression of these genes.
Results: We analyzed the expression patterns of ~170 NBS-LRR-encoding and related genes in Arabidopsis Col-0 using
multiple analytical approaches: expressed sequenced tag (EST) representation, massively parallel signature sequencing
(MPSS), microarray analysis, rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) PCR, and gene trap lines. Most of these genes
were expressed at low levels with a variety of tissue specificities. Expression was detected by at least one approach for
all but 10 of these genes. The expression of some but not the majority of NBS-LRR-encoding and related genes was
affected by salicylic acid (SA) treatment; the response to SA varied among different accessions. An analysis of previously
published microarray data indicated that ten NBS-LRR-encoding and related genes exhibited increased expression in
wild-type Landsberg erecta (Ler) after flagellin treatment. Several of these ten genes also showed altered expression after
SA treatment, consistent with the regulation of R gene expression during defense responses and overlap between the
basal defense response and salicylic acid signaling pathways. Enhancer trap analysis indicated that neither jasmonic acid
nor benzothiadiazole (BTH), a salicylic acid analog, induced detectable expression of the five NBS-LRR-encoding genes
and one TIR-NBS-encoding gene tested; however, BTH did induce detectable expression of the other TIR-NBS-encoding
gene analyzed. Evidence for alternative mRNA polyadenylation sites was observed for many of the tested genes. Evidence
for alternative splicing was found for at least 12 genes, 11 of which encode TIR-NBS-LRR proteins. There was no obvious
correlation between expression pattern, phylogenetic relationship or genomic location of the NBS-LRR-encoding and
related genes studied.
Conclusion: Transcripts of many NBS-LRR-encoding and related genes were defined. Most were present at low levels
and exhibited tissue-specific expression patterns. Expression data are consistent with most Arabidopsis NBS-LRRencoding and related genes functioning in plant defense responses but do not preclude other biological roles.

Background
Over 40 plant resistance (R) genes that are effective
against diverse pathogens and pests, including bacteria,
fungi, viruses, nematodes, and insects, have been cloned
from both monocot and dicot plant species. These R genes
can be divided into at least five classes based on the structure of their encoded proteins [1-4]. Genes encoding
nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeat (NBS-LRR)
proteins are the most prevalent and can be divided into
two major groups based on the encoded N-terminal
domains and differences in the NBS domain, as well as
several subgroups [5-8]. One major group predominantly
encodes a coiled coil domain at the N-terminus (CC-NBSLRR or "CNL"; e.g. RPS2 and RPM1), whereas the other
group has an N-terminal domain with similarity to the
cytoplasmic domain of Drosophila and human Toll-like
receptor (Toll-interleukin-1 receptor-like (TIR) domain;
TIR-NBS-LRR or "TNL"; e.g. L6, N and RPP5). In the Arabidopsis Col-0 genome 149 NBS-LRR-encoding genes (55
CC-NBS-LRR and 94 TIR-NBS-LRR) and an additional 58
related genes that do not encode LRRs have been identified [7,9]. Based on phylogenetic analysis, protein motif
comparisons, and intron positions, four CNL subgroups,
eight TNL subgroups, and a pair of divergent "NL" proteins have been identified in Arabidopsis [7,10]. These
NBS-LRR-encoding genes are distributed as single genes,
clusters, and superclusters in plant genomes [5,7,10,11].
Disease resistance is the predominant function so far
demonstrated for plant NBS-LRR-encoding genes [2].
How NBS-LRR proteins function in disease resistance is
still under investigation [8]. In addition to directly detecting pathogen ligands, R proteins may also monitor
('guard') the status of the targets of pathogen virulence
effectors, or the cellular consequences of the actions of
these proteins [2,12-16]. The LRR domains may be
involved in protein-protein interactions and at least partly
determine resistance specificity [17-27]. Polymorphism in
the TIR region has also been shown to affect resistance
specificity [23,28]. In addition to their role in determining
the recognition specificity, the LRR domains may also participate in defense signaling through both intra- and intermolecular interactions [27,29-32]. NBS regions contain
several conserved motifs and are homologous to the NBARC (nucleotide binding domain shared by Apaf-1, some
R genes and Ced-4) domain of some eukaryotic cell death
effectors such as Apaf-1 and Ced-4 [33]. The NBS domains
of two NBS-LRR proteins, tomato I2 and Mi-1, have been
demonstrated to be able to bind and hydrolyze ATP [34]
and the ATP binding form is the active configuration of
the I2 protein [35], suggesting that the NBS domain functions as a molecular switch in signal transduction eliciting
the defense response. The role of CC-NBS and TIR-NBS
proteins that lack an LRR domain is unknown but they

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/56

may function as adaptor proteins similar to Myd88 in
mammalian systems [9].
Over 14 NBS-LRR-encoding genes that confer resistance
against bacterial, Oomycete, fungal, or viral pathogens
have been isolated from Arabidopsis (Table 1). The
majority of the subgroups of NBS-LRR-encoding genes
contain at least one known R gene or its closest homolog
in the Col-0 genome, suggesting that the majority of NBSLRR-encoding genes could be involved in resistance.
However, some of the smaller and more divergent subgroups do not contain a known resistance gene and there
is limited evidence for the involvement of NBS-LRR proteins in other aspects of plant biology, such as plant development. A T-DNA insertion mutant of an Arabidopsis
TIR-NBS-LRR-encoding gene has altered shade avoidance
as well as disease susceptibility [36]. The adenylyl cyclase
(AC) gene cloned from maize pollen plays a role in pollen-polarized growth, for example, and has sequence similarity to NBS-LRR-encoding genes [37]. The tomato I-2
gene (CNL type) is expressed at the site of lateral root formation suggesting that it may have functions in addition
to pathogen recognition [38]. The other four protein
classes that include R gene products also contain proteins
that participate in other processes, such as two receptorlike kinases, CLAVATA1 and brassinosteroid insensitive1
(BRI1), that are involved in development and hormone
reception, respectively, and another receptor-like protein,
CLAVATA 2, which functions in plant development [3942]. Analysis of the expression patterns of NBS-LRRencoding genes in Arabidopsis may provide clues as to
their functions.
Although an increasing number of R genes are being
cloned, little is known about the regulation of plant R
gene expression. RNA gel-blot analyses have detected low
levels of transcripts for most cloned R genes in unchallenged plants [1,38,43-48]. However, the expression of
few R genes has been investigated in detail. Seven TIRNBS-LRR-encoding R genes (L6, Rpp5, N, M, RPS4, RAC1,
and Bs4) have been shown to encode two or more transcripts [46,49-54]; however, the role of alternative splicing
in disease resistance is unknown. The alternative transcripts of tobacco N gene and Arabidopsis RPS4 are
known to be important for the defense responses mediated by these two R genes [50,52]. Rare alternative splicing
has been found for CC-NBS-LRR-encoding R genes. In
common bean, the alternative transcripts were identified
for CC-NBS-LRR-encoding gene JA1tr and the alternative
splicing is not regulated by pathogen infection [55].
Induction of resistance gene expression by pathogen
infection has only been reported for a very small number
of R genes, such as sugar beet Hs1pro-1, barley Mla, rice Xa1,
and Xa27 [56-59]. The induction of a recently cloned rice
Xa27 gene, encoding a protein with no homology with

other R proteins, at the site of pathogen infection is correlated with resistance [59]. The expression of some NBSLRR-encoding R genes have been shown be affected by
factors other than pathogen infection, such as tissue type,
developmental stage, or environmental conditions
[38,60-62].
The methods for analysis of gene expression have
advanced from single-gene approaches to a variety of global transcript profiling technologies [63,64]. Large scale
expressed sequence tag (EST) sequencing [65] and serial
analysis of gene expression (SAGE, [66]) allow quantitative evaluation of gene expression but are less informative
than massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS;
[67,68]). MPSS generates millions of tags proximal to the
3' ends of transcripts in a stoichiometric manner; therefore the relative abundance of each transcript can be
assessed in each sample and rare transcripts and previously unidentified genes can be detected. It is, however,
costly and few samples can be analyzed. Microarrays
allow an intermediate number of samples to be analyzed
but require a priori knowledge of the genes expressed
unless tiling arrays are used [69,70]. Current challenges in
using microarray analysis include application of appropriate statistical approaches to identify significant changes in
expression and making informative comparisons across
diverse microarray datasets as well as integrating the
microarray data with expression information derived
from other approaches [71,72].

In this paper, we describe multiple genomic approaches to
characterize the expression of NBS-LRR-encoding and
related genes in Arabidopsis. These approaches included
representation in EST libraries, MPSS, microarray experiments, gene trap lines and RACE-PCR. The transcript
structure was defined for over 80 genes. We determined
the level, tissue specificity and possible inducibility of
expression for ~170 NBS-LRR-encoding and related genes.
Most of the NBS-LRR-encoding and related genes investigated were expressed at low levels and with variable tissue
specificities. As previously observed for known R genes,
expression of these genes was induced during the plant
defense response in only a minority of the cases examined. This study provides the foundation for further functional analysis of individual genes.

Results
Representation in Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) libraries
We examined the frequency with which NBS-LRR-encoding transcripts were present in EST collections at several
times during our study. In April 2002, a total of 181,406
Arabidopsis sequences from the NCBI EST database were
searched for similarity to the spliced genomic ORFs and
genomic sequences of 170 NBS-LRR-encoding and related
genes. ESTs were detected for about half (98) of these 170
genes; most genes (81) had five or less representatives per
gene. At these low frequencies other expressed NBS-LRRencoding and related genes could have gone undetected
in this depth of EST sampling. Therefore more efficient
and sensitive methods were used to analyze the expression of NBS-LRR-encoding and related genes. When the

same analysis was repeated in July 2006, 622,792 Arabidopsis EST sequences were searched for similarity to 172
NBS-LRR-encoding and related genes. ESTs were detected
for only about two thirds (120) of the 172 genes analyzed.
Most of these (94) still had ten or fewer representatives
per gene (Table 2; detailed information in additional file
1 and online database [73]).
Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS) analysis
The expression of 170 NBS-LRR-encoding and related
genes was then determined by utilizing the DuPont MPSS
database for Arabidopsis and the public Arabidopsis
MPSS database ([74-77]). On average, there were approximately one million tags in each of the 22 DuPont libraries (Table 3) and about two and half million tags in each
of the seventeen libraries generated by Meyers et al. (Table
4). These tags represent all the transcripts in a given sample and the frequency of each tag is correlated to the
expression level of each represented gene.

Most of the 170 NBS-LRR-encoding and related genes
were detected in at least one library and at low levels (1 to
991 adjusted parts per million (adjPPM) or transcripts per
million (TPM) compared to reference genes such as EF-1α
(769 to 4061 adjPPM) and ACT-2 (6–2925 adjPPM) (reference genes used in [9]). The most highly expressed NBSLRR-encoding or related gene was At3g04210 at a level of
991 TPM in the library made from leaves 52 hours after
treatment with salicylic acid (S52). The second most
highly expressed gene (683 TPM) was At1g72900 in the
library made from callus (CAS). The gene with highest
expression in untreated Arabidopsis tissues was

At3g04210, which was expressed at 322 TPM in a library
made from leaf (LES). Other genes were expressed at
much lower levels than these two genes. About half of the
genes (73) were expressed at very low levels of less than 32
adjPPM or TPM. Expression of only 11 genes was not
detected in any of the 37 MPSS libraries. The genes exhibiting higher levels of expression in the MPSS analysis, for
example At4g33300 and At3g50950, were also well represented in the EST dataset. Expression of 17 of the 21 predicted or potential pseudogenes in Col-0 genome [7] was
detected in at least one MPSS libraries generated from tissue of Col-0.
The total number of NBS-LRR-encoding and related genes
expressed varied widely between MPSS libraries from 101
detected in the Col-0 leaf library (LEF), to 15 detected in
the library made from Col-0 late stage developing seeds
(Ase2lm-la). On average, each gene was present in only 15
of the 39 libraries (Additional file 1). The four most prevalent genes, At1g61190, At1g61300, At1g59124, and
At3g07040, which all encode CC-NBS-LRR proteins, were
detected in 37 out of 39 libraries studied.
Most NBS-LRR-encoding and related genes exhibited different levels of expression in different tissues, at different
developmental stages or in different genotypes of Arabidopsis (Additional file 1). Forty NBS-LRR-encoding and
related genes were expressed at a higher level in callus
than in any other tissues examined in the public Arabidopsis MPSS database. Some genes were preferentially
expressed in aerial plant parts (e.g. At5g44870, 58 TPM in
leaf and 2 TPM in root), while others were root-specific

flowers (e.g. At1g63740, 52 TPM in flower, 17 TPM in silique, and less than 5 TPM in root, leaf and callus). Some
were induced in response to a chemical or hormone (e.g.

and the eight TNL subgroups of NBS-LRR-encoding genes
identified by Meyers et al. [7], a wide variety of gene
expression patterns were observed (Additional file 1).
Consequently, no correlation was detected between gene
expression pattern and position on the phylogenetic tree.
There was also no obvious correlation between chromosomal location and expression pattern (Additional file 1).
One hundred and twenty NBS-LRR-encoding or related
genes (two divergent NLs, 32 CNLs, two CNs, one NL (CC
type), one NBS (CC type), 63 TNLs, five TNLX, two
TNTNL, two TTNL, one NL (TIR type), two XTNX, and
seven TNs) studied were represented by more than one
MPSS tag (Additional file 1). Multiple tags can be detected
for one gene when alternative splicing results in different
stop codons and polyadenylation sites or when the polyadenylation site varies either side of a Sau3A site [9]. A
total of 72 genes showed possible alternative polyadenylation. Twelve of these genes showed possible alternative splicing because some of the tags detected were
located at splice sites or within introns; 11 out of these 12
genes were of TNLs rather than CNLs, consistent with the
multiple introns in TNL-encoding genes and a paucity of
introns in CNL-encoding genes. Alternative splicing was
confirmed by RACE-PCR and subsequent sequencing for
four of these genes: At1g63750, At4g16860 (RPP4
homolog in Col-0), At4g16950 (RPP5 homolog in Col-0),
and At5g46270. The failure to detect alternative transcripts for the other eight genes may have been due to tissue specificity or low abundance of the alternatively
spliced transcripts. For other genes with multiple tags
detected, some were due to shifts in the polyadenylation
site and some were due to the tags representing several
members of a gene family.
Microarray analysis
To examine expression under a different range of conditions than those from which the MPSS libraries had been
made, the expression of NBS-LRR-encoding and related
genes was also analyzed using data from Affymetrix
microarrays that were generated as components of two
larger studies [78,79]. Both of these experiments utilized
the whole genome array (ATH1; Affymetrix), which contained 152 probe sets representing 162 NBS-LRR-encoding and related genes which were located on the
phylogenetic tree generated by Meyers et al. [7], including
13 known resistance genes (RPP8 is not represented on
this array) or their homologs in Col-0.

In one experiment, changes of expression of NBS-LRRencoding and related genes in response to application of
0.3 mM salicylic acid (SA) were analyzed in seven Arabidopsis accessions (Col-0, Cvi-1, Est, Kin-0, Mt-0, Tsu-1,
and Van-0) as part of a study to identify expression level
polymorphisms as described in [79] and ELP website [80].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/56

Re-analysis of this data revealed that approximately twothirds of the NBS-LRR-encoding and related genes were
expressed above the detection threshold in the control
Col-0 sample (in at least one of the three replicates collected 4 hours post treatment with 0.02% silwet). The
expression of nine genes, At1g57630, At1g59124,
At1g72900,
At1g72910,
At3g04210,
At3g50950,
At4g16950, At4g33300, and At5g45510 in at least one of
the three control Col-0 samples was higher than the average of present signal in the corresponding control Col-0
sample. Based on their expression levels in the control
samples, most of the 162 NBS-LRR-encoding and related
genes (138 probe sets out of 152 probe sets) exhibit significant differences in their expression levels between at least
one pair of Arabidopsis accessions, suggesting the natural
variation in expression of NBS-LRR-encoding genes
between different accessions.
The expression levels of the majority of NBS-LRR-encoding and related genes were not significantly altered by the
SA treatment compared to control samples harvested at
the same timepoints; however, the expression of 15 genes
(three CNLs (At3g14470, At5g04720, and At5g66900),
one CN (At5g45490), one CNX (At5g66630), seven TNLs
(At1g17600, At3g44630, At4g12010, At4g16860 (RPP4
homolog), At5g36930, At5g41740, and At5g46520), two
TNs (At1g66090 and At1g72900), and one divergent NL
(At5g45510)) was significantly induced in Col-0 plants 4
hours after SA treatment (Additional files 1 and 2). In
addition, the expression of four NBS-LRR-encoding and
related genes (two TNLs (At3g44400 and At4g36150),
one TN (At3g04210), and one CNL (At3g50950)) was
down-regulated in Col-0 plants 28 hours after SA treatment. These four genes also showed increases in their
expression 4 hours after SA treatment though not to a statistically significant extent.
The expression of different NBS-LRR-encoding and related
genes was affected at different time points after SA treatment in the various Arabidopsis accessions (Additional
file 2). A total of 33 probe sets exhibited differential
expression in response to SA treatment in at least one Arabidopsis accession. Some NBS-LRR-encoding genes exhibited similar responses to SA treatment across different
accessions though some do not. For example, the expression of one CNL-encoding gene, At1g12280, was downregulated both in Est 4 hours after SA treatment and in
Van-0 28 hours after SA treatment. One CNL gene,
At4g14610, showed elevated expression 4 hours after SA
treatment in Kin-0 and Tsu-1. One CNL gene, At5g66900,
showed elevated expression in five Arabidopsis accessions, Col-0, Kin-0, Mt-0, Tsu-1, and Van-0, 4 hours after
SA treatment but down-regulated expression 28 hours
after SA treatment in Van-0 only.

In order to compare the SA responses to changes of expression during the basal defense response, we reanalyzed the
data set on the response to flagellin generated by Zipfel et
al. [78] using the same procedures as used above. In this
analysis, less than half of the NBS-LRR-encoding and
related genes (69) were expressed above the detection
threshold in at least one of the two control wild-type
Landsberg erecta (Ler) samples. The expression of ten
NBS-LRR-encoding and related genes (five CNLs
(At3g07040 (RPM1), At3g50950, At4g26090 (RPS2),
At4g33300, and At5g04720), three TNLs (At1g56510,
At1g56540, and At5g22690), and two TNs (At1g72900
and At1g72940)) was induced by flagellin treatment in
wild-type Ler. Interestingly, out of these ten NBS-LRRencoding and related genes, one gene, At1g72900, was
also induced in Col-0 and Van-0 4 hours after SA treatment; one gene, At5g04720, was also induced in Col-0
and Mt-0 4 hours after SA treatment; two genes,
At4g33300 and At1g56510, were also induced in Mt-0 4
hours after SA treatment; and one gene, At3g50950,
exhibited down-regulated expression in Col-0 28 hours
after SA treatment, suggesting the interaction between
plant basal defense response and SA pathway (Additional
file 2).
Overall, the expression patterns of the NBS-LRR-encoding
and related genes detected in the above microarray experiments were generally consistent among array experiments. Most genes were detected as expressed at low levels
and not induced by treatment with defense signals.
Five of the mRNA samples that were used to generate the
Arabidopsis MPSS libraries described above (LEF, CAF,
INF, ROF, and SIF MPSS libraries; [75-77]) were also analyzed using ATH1 arrays to cross-validate the two
approaches. The expression patterns of the NBS-LRRencoding and related genes detected in the microarray
experiment were generally consistent with the MPSS data
(Table 2; Additional file 1). These 162 genes showed different expression levels in different tissues. For example,
both the MPSS data and Affymetrix array data indicated
that At4g16990 has its highest expression in leaf, lower
expression in flowers and siliques, and its lowest expression in callus and root. Most genes were usually the most
highly expressed in callus; expression levels in flowers and
siliques were similar (Figure 1). Forty-six of the 67 genes
with undetectable levels of expression in the leaf sample
in the microarray analysis had 0 MPSS tags in the leaf
MPSS library (LEF), while 75 of the 95 genes detected by
microarray analysis had more than one tag in the MPSS
leaf library. For 88 NBS-LRR-encoding and related genes
which are represented by unique MPSS tags and probe sets
on the ATH1 array, Spearman rank correlation test
showed a good correlation between MPSS data and

Reporter gene traps
We attempted to use enhancer and gene trap lines in parallel to the above global analyses, to gain information on
cell-specific expression patterns for individual NBS-LRRencoding or related genes and to investigate their inducibility in greater detail. Gene traps and enhancer traps contain insertions of the β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene
under the control of no promoter or a minimal promoter
respectively [81-83]. The expression pattern of a gene with
a reporter gene inserted within it or nearby can be monitored via expression of the reporter gene. Gene trap and
enhancer traps also allow the analysis of the mutant phenotypes resulting from the disruption of chromosomal
genes [81-84].

the Ds insertion lines from Singapore IMA (Institute of

Molecular Agrobiology, [86]) were searched in 2002 for
insertions in NBS-LRR-encoding and related genes using
BLAST. Ten enhancer trap lines and three gene trap lines
were identified with insertions into NBS-LRR-encoding or
related genes. The insertion sites and orientations were
confirmed for seven enhancer trap lines with insertions
into five NBS-LRR-encoding genes and two TIR-NBSencoding genes (Table 5, Figures 2 and 3). No gene trap
lines were confirmed.
The expression pattern of the corresponding NBS-LRRencoding and related gene in each confirmed enhancer
trap line was analyzed using GUS staining and quantitative GUS assays of seedlings and five-week old plants. No
GUS activity was detected histochemically in whole seedling, leaves, roots, flowers and stems of any of the five
NBS-LRR and one TIR-NBS enhancer trap lines. This indicated that the low levels of expression detected in the
microarray and MPSS experiments for these genes were
below the detection threshold of GUS assays in these
enhancer trap lines. We found no evidence that any specific cell types exhibited localized, high levels of expression as has been observed for insertions into some other
types of genes [81,87,88]. In the enhancer trap line with
an insertion into a TIR-NBS-encoding gene, At1g72910,
there was very faint blue color throughout the leaf after
staining for GUS activity. This low level of GUS activity
was confirmed using a GUS quantitative assay (Figure 4).
At1g72910 was one of the more highly expressed genes
detected in the MPSS libraries and microarray data in Col0 leaves (Table 5). These data indicate the threshold necessary for histochemical detection of gene activity in gene
trap lines.
These seven NBS-LRR-encoding and related genes were
not induced by either salicylic acid (SA) or flagellin treatments in the above microarray experiments. To investigate
the possibility that detectable changes in expression

occurred transiently at time points not examined in the
microarray experiments, jasmonic acid (JA) or benzothiadiazole (BTH) was applied to each of the enhancer trap
plants. Neither GUS staining nor quantitative GUS assays
provided evidence of induced expression of any the five
NBS-LRR-encoding genes and one TIR-NBS-encoding
gene in response to BTH or JA (data not shown). The
expression of At1g72910, on the other hand, was induced
approximately two-fold five days after treatment with
BTH (Figure 4), although significant induction by SA had
not been detected in the microarray analysis. To examine
the possibility that changes in expression occurred in a
restricted number of cells at sites of pathogen penetration,
each of the seven enhancer trap plant was challenged by
P. syringae pv. tomato strain DC3000 carrying avrRpt2 or
avrRpm1. All lines showed a similar hypersensitive
response (HR) as wild-type Landsberg erecta (Ler) plants,
which is the genetic background of the enhancer and gene
trap lines. There was no observable localized induction of
GUS gene expression in the infiltrated area that reacted to
the pathogen.
Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) analysis
The expression of NBS-LRR-encoding and related genes
was further studied using RACE-PCR as a sensitive qualitative method to detect expression as well as to define the
5' and 3' ends of the transcripts. Confirmation of transcript boundaries was a prerequisite to studies of gene
function because approximately a third of the NBS-LRRencoding and related genes in the public database were
previously annotated incorrectly and therefore had to be
corrected by manual re-annotation [7]. The sequences of
our 5' and 3' RACE products were compared with the Arabidopsis genomic sequence to determine the initiation
and termination sites of each transcript (Additional file 1
and online database [73]).

The distribution of CC-NBS-LRR-encoding and related genes
The distribution of CC-NBS-LRR-encoding and related genes
analyzed on neighbor-joining tree generated by Meyers et al.
[7]. The genes studied by RACE are indicated by black
arrows, the genes analyzed using RT-PCR are displayed in
bold italic, and NBS-LRR-encoding and related genes with
enhancer trap insertions are marked in bold. Other figure
denotations are as described in Meyers et al. [7].

A total of 109 NBS-LRR-encoding and related genes were
analyzed using total RNA extracted from leaves of Col-0 as
template. At least one RACE product was detected for 81
genes (for 26 out of 35 CNL genes and for 38 out of 50
TNL genes analyzed; Table 2). Both 5' and 3' products
were detected for 68 of these 81 genes. Only 5' products
were detected for another six genes and only 3' products
for an additional seven genes. Neither 5' nor 3' products
were detected for the other 28 genes; the lack of expression of six of these 28 genes in leaves was confirmed using
RT-PCR with primers that should have amplified an internal region of the transcript (Figures 2 and 3, Table 2).
RACE for six NBS-LRR-encoding genes that were not
detectable in leaves from four-week old plants was also
conducted using total RNA extracted from seven-day old
seedlings as templates. RACE again failed to detect expression of five of these genes, At2g17050, At3g46730,
At4g08450, At4g09360, and At4g27190. RACE products
were only detected for At1g65850 in seedlings. For two
NBS-LRR-encoding genes, At3g44400 and At4g33300,
RACE was also performed using the total RNA extracted

from flowers as templates in addition to the templates
generated from leaf and young seedlings. The RACE
results revealed that the expression of these two NBS-LRRencoding genes showed different expression pattern in
leaves, seedlings, and flowers. At4g33300 was expressed
highest in seedlings, and then the flower and leaf tissues,
while At3g44400 was expressed higher in leaves than in
flowers.
For the above RACE-PCR products, the length of the 5'
UTR ranged from zero to 241 bp (average = ~50 bp); most
5' transcription start sites were within 100 bp of the ATG
start codon. There was some variation in the transcription
initiation site and often multiple initiation sites were
detected for each gene. The length of the 3' UTR ranged
from 6 bp to 896 bp and most 3' UTRs were several hundred bp long (average = ~250 bp). The most common variation in 3'UTRs was due to alternative polyadenylation
sites. Comparison of RACE and genomic sequences
revealed that 15 genes contained introns in their 5' or 3'
UTR regions. Seven genes had one intron and one had two
introns in their 5' UTRs. Six genes had one intron and one
had three introns in their 3'UTRs. The presence of introns
in either 5' or 3' UTRs has also been indicated in the TAIR
database [89]. Six out of eight genes which have introns in
their 5' UTR according to our RACE results have also been
annotated as having introns in the TAIR database, and
similarly five out of seven genes which have introns in 3'
UTR have also been so annotated in the TAIR database.
Sequence analysis of the RACE-PCR products revealed
that the annotations of 12 NBS-LRR-encoding and related
genes in the TAIR database were incorrect or at least inconsistent with our experimental data (Additional file 1).
These genes had been annotated with incorrect transcript
initiation or termination sites, different splicing sites, or
extra exons. The RACE-PCR products validated the previous manual re-annotations for six genes [7]. The errors in
the other six genes had not previously been detected.
These six genes had different splicing events from those
predicted. RACE-PCR data also revealed the presence of
alternative splicing in the 5'UTR of At1g10920 and 3'UTR
of At1g72860, in addition to the four genes which were
indicated by MPSS data as exhibiting alternative splicing
and had been confirmed by RACE-PCR and sequencing.

Discussion
Our comprehensive expression analysis revealed that the
majority of NBS-LRR-encoding and related genes in Arabidopsis were expressed at low levels and unexpectedly that
many exhibited tissue-specific expression patterns (Additional file 1). The expression of some but not the majority
of NBS-LRR-encoding and related genes was affected by
treatments with defense signaling chemicals. The expression pattern of most of the previously uncharacterized

The genes studied by RACE are indicated by black arrows, the genes analyzed using RT-PCR are displayed in bold italic, and

NBS-LRR-encoding and related genes resembles that of
known R genes and therefore is consistent with these
genes also functioning in disease resistance.

Consistency between different analytical approaches
The different analytical approaches varied in their sensitivity and accuracy, but the expression data obtained from
each approach were generally consistent. Both MPSS and

microarrays were the most efficient genome-wide transcript profiling methods and they correlated well. MPSS
has several advantages over microarray analysis. MPSS is
more sensitive and accurate, since MPSS provides quantitative assessment of the abundance of each transcript as
opposed to the hybridization intensity generated for each
probe set in the microarray analysis. MPSS is particularly
advantageous for genes that are expressed at low levels
and therefore tend to be more affected by background
noise in microarray analysis. For example, both
At5g45230 and At1g17600 were expressed at undetectable levels in microarray analysis of leaf tissue; however,
based on MPSS data, At1g17600 was expressed clearly
higher than At5g45230 in the leaf library (14 vs 0 TPM)
(Additional file 1). MPSS can also distinguish multi-gene
family members better than microarrays and therefore
decrease cross-hybridization problems, which is more
common in microarray analysis. Inconsistencies between
MPSS and microarray data could have been due to crosshybridization problems in the microarray analysis or due
to some MPSS tags representing several gene family members that had high sequence similarity. In addition,
sequencing errors in the current Arabidopsis genome
assembly may have caused incorrect assignment of some
MPSS tags and thus inaccurate determination of expression. While MPSS has the above advantages, its technical
accessibility and high cost limit its widespread use,
although these issues may be ameliorated with the latest
sequencing technologies. Microarrays therefore remain a
useful complement to investigate situations for which
MPSS data do not exist until other high throughput

Expression levels of NBS-LRR-encoding genes
The majority of NBS-LRR-encoding and related genes
examined in this study were expressed at low levels in
unchallenged plants similar to what has been observed for
most cloned plant R genes. Significant changes in expression of most NBS-LRR-encoding and related genes including the known R genes were not detected during plant
defense responses or treatments with two defense signaling molecules, SA or JA. Other recent RNA profiling experiments also failed to detect differential expression of R
genes [90,91]. Similarly, in another microarray experiment performed to study gene expression changes during
the resistance response, none of the Arabidopsis NBSLRR-encoding genes showed significant expression
changes during the plant defense response mediated by
RPS2, RPM1, RPS5, or RPS4 (A. Bent et al., unpublished).
This lack of induction of gene expression during plant
defense response resembles that of most known plant R
genes. Although it is still not clear how plant R proteins
function in the plant defense response, it is clear that they
act at an early step in defense signaling pathways, either as
primary recognition molecules or accessory proteins [1416,92-94]. Low levels of constitutive expression of R proteins are consistent with a constitutive ability to recognize
the pathogen infection and induce downstream defense
responses.

There are, however, several indications of transcriptional
control of R gene expression. At least a subset of R genes
are induced above their low levels of constitutive expression during the elicitation of basal resistance; the expression of RPS2, RPM1, and eight other NBS-LRR-encoding
and related genes was induced by the bacterial flagellin
peptide, flg22 [78]. This can be thought of increasing the
general sensitivity of the plant to detect potential pathogens. Our analysis also revealed that fifteen NBS-LRRencoding and related genes in wild-type Col-0, including
the Col-0 homolog of RPP4, were induced 4 hours after
treatment with SA; also several other genes were induced
by SA in other accessions. Interestingly, out of the fifteen
NBS-LRR-encoding and related genes induced by SA in
Col-0, two genes also exhibited elevated expression
induced by flg22. This overlap suggests interactions
between plant basal defense response and SA signaling
pathways. The MPSS data indicated that expression of
many NBS-LRR-encoding and related genes was also
affected by plant developmental stage or treatments with
sucrose or the plant hormone ABA. In addition, our gene
trap studies of a limited number of R gene related
sequences demonstrated the induction of the expression
of one TIR-NBS-encoding gene, At1g72910, by the SA
homolog, BTH. A previous transcript profiling experiment

Page 11 of 20

BMC Plant Biology 2007, 7:56

in Arabidopsis also revealed the expression of several
NBS-LRR-encoding and related genes was altered during
defense response to cucumber mosaic virus strain Y; the
expression of one TIR-NBS-LRR-encoding gene,
At1g56510, and one TIR-X-encoding gene, At1g65400,
was down-regulated, and that of two other TIR-X-encoding genes, At1g72940 and At1g72920, was induced [95].
These results all provide evidence for regulation of R gene
expression during plant defense response and the induction of enhanced levels of defense-related surveillance in
response to biotic challenge.
Tissue specificity
An unexpected result from the current study was the frequent tissue-specific expression patterns exhibited by
NBS-LRR-encoding and related genes. Both the MPSS data
and the microarray data demonstrated that many NBSLRR-encoding and related genes showed tissue specificity.
Some genes were mainly expressed in aerial parts of
plants, while some genes were specifically expressed in
roots. Others appeared to be developmentally regulated.
These patterns of differential expression suggest either
that NBS-LRR-encoding and related genes function in
resistance to a variety of pathogens that attack different
parts of the plant, or that some NBS-LRR-encoding and
related genes function in different plant biological processes. Previous to our studies there was little data on the
tissue specificity of known R genes. All of the 14 known
NBS-LRR-encoding R genes or their Col-0 homologs analyzed in our study exhibited tissue specific gene expression. Interestingly, the tomato NBS-LRR-encoding R gene,
I-2, is expressed at the site of lateral root formation indicating that it might have a role in lateral root initiation in
addition to disease resistance [38].
Alternative transcripts
Alternative splicing was detected for several NBS-LRRencoding genes. Twelve NBS-LRR-encoding genes showed
evidence of alternative splicing based on the locations of
MPSS tags and four of these genes, including the Col-0
homologs of two known R genes, RPP5 and RPP4, were
confirmed by RACE-PCR and subsequent sequencing. The
alternative transcripts of two genes (At1g63750 and
At4g16860) encode truncated proteins containing only
the majority of TIR domain and lacking both the NBS and
LRR domains. The alternative transcript of At5g46270
encodes a truncated protein lacking most of the LRR
domain, while alternative transcripts of At4g16950
encode TIR-NBS-LRR proteins with only the last few
amino acids altered. The alternative splicing in At1g10920
and At1g72860 which was revealed by RACE-PCR occurs
in the 5' or 3'UTR and therefore does not change the
amino acid sequence; however, such alternative splicing
could affect transcript stability and therefore the expression level. Alternative splicing has been reported for seven

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/56

known TIR-NBS-LRR-encoding R genes and one CC-NBSLRR-encoding R gene [46,49-55]. Based on alignments of
genomic sequences with full-length cDNA and EST
sequences, 1186 Arabidopsis genes in the TIGR database
[96] have been annotated as undergoing splicing variation
and have been classified into five different types of splicing variants. Although ten NBS-LRR-encoding or related
genes are included in these 1186 genes, only one gene was
identified as exhibiting alternative splicing by MPSS or
RACE analysis in our studies. A recent extensive computational analysis [97] identified alternative splicing events
in 4707 Arabidopsis genes including 16 NBS-LRR-encoding and related genes. Seven out of these 16 genes were
also identified in TIGR database; however, only two out of
these 16 genes were also detected as showing alternative
splicing by MPSS or RACE analysis in our studies. This
inconsistency may be due to RACE and MPSS tending to
analyze sequences at the ends of transcript or due to the
lack of sampling the appropriate tissues or conditions.
Together, these data indicate that at least 22 TIR-NBS-LRRencoding, one TIR-NBS-encoding, one divergent NBSLRR-encoding, and eight CC-NBS-LRR-encoding genes
exhibit alternative splicing in Arabidopsis.
The role of alternative splicing in plant R genes is unclear.
The splice variants might interact with the full length R
protein and have a regulatory role in disease resistance as
has been suggested for the tobacco N and Arabidopsis
RPS4 genes. This is similar to the role of alternative splicing in animal toll-like receptor (TLRs) [98]. The alternative transcript of the tobacco N gene is induced by
challenge with tobacco mosaic virus and the ratio of the
two transcripts appears to be critical for resistance [50,99].
The presence of both full-length and alternative transcripts of Arabidopsis RPS4 is necessary for the RPS4mediated defense response [52,100]. However, the alternative transcripts of flax L6 and tomato Bs4 seem not to be
important for the resistance that these genes mediate
[49,54].
One of the TIR-NBS-encoding genes, At1g72910, may
function in plant defense response as indicated by the
induction of its expression by a SA analog, BTH. Similarly,
six TIR-NBS-encoding genes, At1g17610, At1g66090,
At1g72890, At1g72900, At1g72950, and At3g04210, may
also function in plant defense response since their expression was affected by SA treatment in at least one of the
seven Arabidopsis ecotypes studied. Two TIR-NBS-encoding genes, At1g72900 and At1g72940, may function in
plant basal defense response since their expression was
induced by flagellin. In the Arabidopsis Col-0 genome,
there are 21 TIR-NBS-encoding genes that have similar
structures as the alternative transcripts of the tobacco N,
flax L6 or Arabidopsis RPS4 genes [9]. These might func-

tion similarly to the alternatively transcribed variants of
TIR-NBS-LRR-encoding genes.
Post-transcriptional regulation
R genes do not need to be induced at the transcriptional
level in order to alter resistance against pathogens. There
are likely to be multiple levels of negative regulation to
prevent the inappropriate activation of R proteins in the
absence of pathogen that would be deleterious to plants
due to the high cost of the defense response and pathogen-independent cell death. There may also be feedback
loops controlling the R gene expression and the extent of
HR.

Our study analyzed steady state mRNA levels, which may
not reflect protein abundance. Further work is required to
identify whether there are differences in the polysomal
fraction and what post-translational modifications occur.
The expression of several R genes has been reported to be
regulated at the post-transcriptional level. The transcript
of Arabidopsis RPM1 remains at a low level before and
after pathogen attack; however, the RPM1 protein is
degraded during HR [101]. The expression of Xa21 gene
transcript is independent of plant developmental stage,
though the Xa21-conferred resistance is developmentally
regulated [102].
Data from animal systems have demonstrated the
involvement of the 5'UTR in controlling translation and
tissue specific expression [103,104]. Several plant R genes
contain introns and/or upstream open reading frames
(uORFs) in their 5'UTR including barley Mla6 and Arabidopsis RPP1-WsB and RPP1-WsC [19,105]. Our RACE
analysis revealed that fifteen out of the 81 NBS-LRRencoding and related genes analyzed contained introns in
their 5' or 3' UTRs. These 5'UTR features may be indicative
of post-transcriptional regulation of these genes.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/56

between transcript and protein levels will likely be
informative as will the characterization of the spectrum of
genes induced downstream of each major clade of NBSLRR-encoding genes.

Methods
Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) analysis
EST representation for each Arabidopsis NBS-LRR-encoding or related gene was obtained by searching the NCBI
EST database using the predicted cDNA sequence or
genomic sequence (plus 500 bp upstream and downstream of the predicted start and stop codons) of each
NBS-LRR-encoding or related gene [7] using BLAST [106].
As of July 14th, 2006, this database contained a total of
622,792 Arabidopsis EST sequences including: short, single read cDNA sequences, cDNA sequences from differential display experiments and RACE analyses, and cDNA
sequences from full-length cDNA clones from RIKEN
(The Institute of Physical and Chemical Research, Japan)
[107]. All Arabidopsis ESTs with matches of greater than
80% identity to NBS-LRR-encoding and related genes
were investigated. EST representation was determined
based on the alignment between ESTs and the genomic or
cDNA sequence of the corresponding gene and usually
showed > 97% sequence similarity. Each potential representative EST was compared against the complete Arabidopsis genomic and spliced sequences using TAIR BLAST
tool [108] to confirm that it was the best match to the represented gene. The ESTs showing best match to a specific
NBS-LRR-encoding or related gene but with sequence
identity less than 97% due to obvious sequencing difficulties were also counted. The ESTs that showed the same
level of sequence similarity to several closely related family members were counted for each represented gene. A
similar analysis was also performed earlier in April 2002
except that FASTA [109] was used to search for sequence
similarity. The NCBI EST database contained about
181,406 Arabidopsis sequences at that time.

Conclusion
Transcripts of most NBS-LRR-encoding and related genes
analyzed were present at low levels in unchallenged
plants. Many showed tissue specific expression patterns.
Transcript levels of the majority of NBS-LRR-encoding
and related genes were not altered during the plant
defense response or by treatments with plant defense signaling molecules; however, the expression of several
genes was altered and may be indicative of altered levels
of surveillance by the plant. Our data are consistent with
the primary function of the majority of NBS-LRR-encoding and related genes being plant resistance; however, this
does not preclude their involvement in functions other
than pathogen recognition.
Future studies on the significance of tissue specificity, the
roles of alternative transcripts and the relationship

Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS) data
MPSS provides a comprehensive assessment of gene
expression by generating short sequence tags, each 17 to
20 bp long, produced from a defined position (usually the
first Sau3A restriction site 5' to the polyadenylation site of
a transcript) within each transcript [67,68]. The expression level of each gene in a sample is determined by
counting the number of diagnostic sequence tags representing the transcript of a particular gene.

The DuPont MPSS database contained expression profiles
generated from 22 Arabidopsis MPSS libraries. Half were
constructed from Arabidopsis ecotype Columbia (Col-0)
or Landsberg erecta (Ler) tissues collected at different
developmental stages and half were constructed from wild
type or mutant Col-0 or Ler ecotype plants treated with

BMC Plant Biology 2007, 7:56

various chemicals or hormones including abscisic acid
(ABA), dexamethasone (DEX), or sucrose (Table 3). Each
library contained approximately one million 17 bp tags.
Seventeen additional MPSS libraries were made from various Arabidopsis Col-0 tissues (callus, flower, leaf, silique,
and root from wild-type or flowering mutants) or salicylic
acid (SA) treated leaf tissues and displayed in the public
MPSS database (Table 4, [74-76]). Each of these public
libraries contained about two and half million 17 bp tags.
For the analysis of the DuPont MPSS data, searches were
performed using the genomic sequence for each NBS-LRRencoding or related gene plus 500 bp upstream and downstream of the predicted start and stop codons. In a few
cases the additional flanking sequence overlapped adjacent genes with small intergenic regions; however, these
were manually checked and did not contain expressed
tags that could have biased the analysis. Each expressed
tag was also compared against the complete Arabidopsis
genomic and spliced sequences using TAIR BLAST tool
[108] to confirm the correct match to the designated gene;
only matches to the sense strand were used in the calculations of transcript abundance. The frequency of each tag
was counted and then normalized in parts per million
(PPM) to calculate the abundance of each transcript in the
sample. The PPM values were adjusted (adjPPM) to
account for potential sequencing errors (described in [9]).
The possible alternative polyadenylations caused by alternative splicing and variable stop codons were predicted
based on the tag location. For the Arabidopsis MPSS data
generated by Meyers et al. [75,76], a basic query was performed for each gene based on gene "At" number (gene
identifier) against the 17 MPSS libraries. To allow comparisons among libraries, the signature frequencies were
normalized to transcripts per million (TPM). For genes
associated with multiple expressed signatures, the sum of
abundance for all expressed signatures, including the signatures with more than one hit to the Arabidopsis
genome, was used to indicate the abundance of each transcript in the sample.
In order to investigate potential correlations between gene
expression and phylogenetic position, the expression level
and tissue specificity of each NBS-LRR-encoding or related
gene was compared with the phylogenetic tree described
previously [7]. To investigate potential correlations
between gene expression pattern and chromosomal location, these NBS-LRR-encoding and related genes were
sorted by their gene identifiers, which usually reflects their
chromosomal locations, and then the expression pattern
of NBS-LRR-encoding and related genes was visually compared to their locations on this sorted gene list.

Microarray analysis
Concurrent global expression experiments using ATH1
Affymetrix arrays provided the opportunity to assess the
expression patterns of NBS-LRR-encoding and related
genes.

The experiment analyzing the response to applications of
salicylic acid (SA) was described in [79]. Six-week old
plants from seven Arabidopsis thaliana accessions (Col-0,
Cvi-1, Est, Kin-0, Mt-0, Tsu-1, and Van-0) were sprayed
with 0.3 mM SA in 0.02% Silwet L77. Plants treated with
0.02% Silwet L77 were used as controls. The aerial parts of
the plants were harvested 4, 28 or 52 hours later. Each
treatment and time-point was replicated three times. Gene
expression levels were assayed using the Affymetrix ATH1
GeneChips. The ATH1 array contains approximately
22,000 genes including 152 probe sets representing 162
NBS-LRR-encoding and related genes based on Affymetrix
annotation [110]. Raw data (CEL files) were imported
into GeneChip® Operating Software data base (GCOS).
Transcript abundances for all probe sets on the Affymetrix
ATH1 GeneChips array were analyzed using GCOS. GCOS
was also used to assess the presence or absence of a given
transcript (P, present; A, absent; M, marginal) for each
probe set. To allow direct comparison between chips, raw
signals were globally scaled so that the mean expression
level of each array was equal to an arbitrary target intensity
of 500. The scaled signals were then imported into Excel
for further analysis.
Raw array data (CEL files) of another experiment [78]
studying flagellin treated Arabidopsis plants were
obtained from ArrayExpress [111]. In this experiment, the
Ler accession of Arabidopsis seedlings were treated with
10 μM flg22 peptide and plantlets analyzed 30 minutes
after treatment. GCOS was used to extract the expression
signal and assign a present or absent call for each gene represented by a probe set on the ATH1 array. The data was
processed in the same manner as for the SA induction
experiment: raw signals were globally scaled to a target
intensity of 500 for direct comparison.
Microarray analysis was also performed on the same five
total RNA samples used for generating five of the 17 public MPSS libraries. Gene expression levels were also
assayed using the ATH1 arrays. Complementary RNA
labeling, hybridization, and signal acquisition were performed according to the manufacturer's guidelines
(Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Affymetrix Microarray Suite
version 5.0 (MAS 5.0) was used to control washing, scanning and data-preprocessing steps. Raw CEL files were
then imported into GCOS and GCOS was used to extract
the expression signals and assign a present or absent call.
To allow direct comparison across chips, raw signals were
globally scaled to a target intensity of 500.

BMC Plant Biology 2007, 7:56

All data analysis was subsequently performed using GeneSpring GX 7.3.1 software (Agilent Technologies, Santa
Clara, CA). The raw output signals from GCOS, without
scaling and normalization, were used as input for analysis
in GeneSpring GX. The raw signals were first normalized
using the 50th percentile of all measurements on a given
chip and then the median measurement of each gene was
adjusted to 1. In order to identify differentially expressed
genes in response to SA or flagellin, a list of probe sets
showing reliable and detectable expression was first established using several criteria. Probe sets were retained if
they were called as present or marginal by GCOS in both
replicates (or two out of three replicates) of at least one of
the two comparison conditions, their coefficient of variation (CV) were less than 0.3 in at least one of the two comparison conditions, and they exhibited at least two fold
changes. Starting from this list of genes, the genes exhibiting a significant expression change in a given treatment
were identified as those genes passing the parametric test
(Welch t-test) in GeneSpring GX, without assuming equal
variances and with multiple testing correction (Benjamini
and Hochberg False Discovery Rate), and a P-value threshold of 0.1. The log-transformed normalized signals were
used when performing these parametric tests.
The expression level polymorphism between seven Arabidopsis accessions for each NBS-LRR-encoding gene was
determined using ELP Finder tool [112]. Affymetrix ATH1
GeneChip probeset IDs were entered as query and the
average expression value for each gene in a given accession
with the standard error was returned. The results of pairwise t-tests between the accessions selected were also
returned.
The possible correlation between MPSS and microarray
data was analyzed using Spearman rank correlation test
conducted in SAS9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). The MPSS
and microarray data analyzed using this test was generated from the same leaf sample and only the 88 NBS-LRRencoding and related genes that had unique representative Affymetrix probe sets and MPSS sequence tags were
included.
Plant materials and growth conditions
Arabidopsis Col-0 plants used for Rapid Amplification of
cDNA ends (RACE) analysis were grown in soil (Premier
Pro-Mix B mix) in controlled-environment chambers at
21°C with 50% humidity, on a 16 hr light/8 hr dark cycle,
and under 100 to 120 μEi illumination.

The gene trap and enhancer trap lines (Landsberg erecta
(Ler) background) were obtained from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) or Singapore Institute of Molecular Agrobiology (IMA) [85,86]. The seedlings from each
gene trap line were first selected on 1/2 MS medium agar

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/56

plates with 50 μg/ml kanamycin and then the surviving
seedlings were transferred to soil. These plants were grown
in controlled-environment chambers with the same conditions as above.
Analysis of gene trap lines
The gene traps lines carried the β-glucuronidase (uidA)
reporter gene at sequence-characterized positions [81-84].
The genomic sequences of 207 NBS-LRR-encoding and
related genes were searched against the flanking sequence
databases of Gene Trap lines generated at Cold Spring
Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) [85] and Ds insertion lines
generated at Singapore Institute of Molecular Agrobiology
(IMA) [86] using BLAST [106]. For each trap line, tissue
PCR [113] was performed to confirm the insertion site
and determine the orientation of the inserted element by
using a gene-specific primer and a uidA specific primer.

To study the induction of NBS-LRR-encoding gene expression, jasmonic acid (JA; 500 μM) was dissolved in 10% v/
v ethanol and sprayed onto five-week old plants in sterile
containers. Benzothiadiazole (BTH; 1.2 mM) was dissolved in water with a wettable powder carrier (same
amount of carrier as BTH) and similarly sprayed onto the
five-week old plants in sterile containers. Treatments with
10% v/v ethanol or the wettable powder carrier were used
as controls for each experiment. Whole plants were collected at different time points from 0, 24, and 48 hrs, to 5
days after each treatment and then subjected to GUS histochemical staining and GUS activity assays. Each gene
trap plant was also challenged with P. syringae pv. tomato
strain DC3000 carrying avrRpt2 or avrRpm1 which caused
a hypersensitive response (HR) in wild-type Col-0 and Ler
plants. The HR response was examined at 16 hours, 1 day
and 2 days after pathogen infiltration and GUS staining
was performed at the same time.
Histochemical staining for GUS activity was performed
according to a slightly modified protocol from [114,115].
Plant tissues were immersed in the GUS staining solution
(100 mM sodium phosphate (pH7.0), 2 mM K3Fe(CN)6,
2 mM K4Fe(CN)6, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100,
100 μg/ml chloramphenicol, with 1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-glucuronide cyclohexylammonium
salt (X-gluc, Gold Biotechnology Inc., St. Louis, MO,
U.S.A.). The plant tissues were incubated with GUS staining solutions at 37°C for 24 hrs.
GUS activity was quantified fluorometrically using 4methylumbelliferone glucuronide (MUG, Sigma) as a
substrate as described by Jefferson et al[114]. Reactions
were performed in 200 μl of extraction buffer (50 mM
NaPO4 pH7, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1%
Sodium Lauryl Sarcosine, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol)
containing 1.1 mM MUG and stopped after 1 h incuba-

tion at 37°C by addition of 800 μl 0.2 M Na2CO3. The fluorescence was calibrated using 4-methylumbelliferone
(MU, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). Total protein was determined using Bradford reagents and BSA as a standard
[116].
Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE)-PCR
RACE-PCR was performed with the Marathon™ cDNA
Amplification Kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA
was extracted from the leaves of about four-week old wildtype Arabidopsis Col-0 plants, seven-day old seedlings, or
flower tissues using the TRIzol procedure (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA). Template mRNA was then purified from
total RNA using Dynabeads® Oligo (dT)25 (Dynal Biotech,
Lake Success, NY, USA). RACE-PCR products were cloned
into the pCR®2.1-TOPO® vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) and sequenced. Sequence data were analyzed using
BLAST and Sequencer 3.1 (GeneCodes, Ann Arbor, MI).
All RACE sequences were deposited into NCBI GenBank
under accession numbers from ES444179 to ES444640
and from EX654484 to EX654486.
Reverse Transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)
RT-PCR was carried out using Advantage™ RT-for-PCR Kit
(Clontech, Mountain View, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers were designed to amplify
regions containing an intron in order to distinguish
genomic DNA contamination from gene transcripts.
