hot spots

Abstract
Background: Systematic mutagenesis studies have shown that only a few interface residues termed hot spots
contribute significantly to the binding free energy of protein-protein interactions. Therefore, hot spots prediction
becomes increasingly important for well understanding the essence of proteins interactions and helping narrow
down the search space for drug design. Currently many computational methods have been developed by
proposing different features. However comparative assessment of these features and furthermore effective and
accurate methods are still in pressing need.
Results: In this study, we first comprehensively collect the features to discriminate hot spots and non-hot spots
and analyze their distributions. We find that hot spots have lower relASA and larger relative change in ASA,
suggesting hot spots tend to be protected from bulk solvent. In addition, hot spots have more contacts including
hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and atomic contacts, which favor complexes formation. Interestingly, we find that
conservation score and sequence entropy are not significantly different between hot spots and non-hot spots in
Ab+ dataset (all complexes). While in Ab- dataset (antigen-antibody complexes are excluded), there are significant
differences in two features between hot pots and non-hot spots. Secondly, we explore the predictive ability for
each feature and the combinations of features by support vector machines (SVMs). The results indicate that
sequence-based feature outperforms other combinations of features with reasonable accuracy, with a precision of
0.69, a recall of 0.68, an F1 score of 0.68, and an AUC of 0.68 on independent test set. Compared with other
machine learning methods and two energy-based approaches, our approach achieves the best performance.
Moreover, we demonstrate the applicability of our method to predict hot spots of two protein complexes.
Conclusion: Experimental results show that support vector machine classifiers are quite effective in predicting hot
spots based on sequence features. Hot spots cannot be fully predicted through simple analysis based on
physicochemical characteristics, but there is reason to believe that integration of features and machine learning
methods can remarkably improve the predictive performance for hot spots.

Background
A lot of biological processes are regulated or performed
by protein-protein interactions [1-5]. Elucidating the
molecular mechanism of proteins interactions is a key
topic in protein function study. Hence, to fully understand or control biological processes, we need to probe
the principles of protein-protein interactions. However,
the affinity and specificity in protein-protein interfaces

are still poorly understood and many fundamental problems are yet to be solved. In the past years, much
efforts have been directed towards the characteristics of
protein-protein interfaces, such as electronics interaction, van der Waals forces, shape complementary, residue frequencies, residue-residue contact preferences,
and so on [6-12]. Our understanding of protein-protein
interfaces benefits greatly from structural analysis, biophysical, or biochemical properties of protein-protein
interfaces. Importantly, it has been pointed out that only
a few interface residues are central to the binding energy
of protein-protein complexes [13,14]. Identifying some

key residues that are responsible for protein association
can provide important clues for drug design or the
causes of many diseases, and a stepping-stone for
important applications such as interface redesign.
Large-scale mutation studies have indicated that, “hot
spots"- the subset of interface residues, bear most of
energetic cost of binding [13-15]. Alanine scanning
mutagenesis is the most widely used technique for identifying hot spot residues. When these hot spot residues
have been mutated to alanine, they would lead to a
striking loss in binding free energy [14]. The role of
residues surrounding hot spots has not been well understood until now, and these residues perhaps create a suitable environment for the binding of subunits [14,16,17].
Many studies have demonstrated that most interface
residues could be mutated without changing the affinity
of proteins complexes [13,18]. Systematic analyses have
shown that hot spot residues are abundant in Tyr, Trp,
and Arg [14,19]. Lise et al [20] have analysed the distribution of amino acids in hot spots, and found that Trp,
Tyr, and Lys appear more frequently in hot spots, which
is similar to Bogan’s conclusion [14]. It has been shown
that hot spots are not evenly distributed along the protein interfaces; rather they are clustered within locally
tightly packed regions in the core of the interface.
Within the dense clusters, they form a complicated network of interactions and consequently contribute to the
stability of the complex; however the contributions of
independent clusters are additive [21].
Our major focus in this study is to computationally
predict these hot spots in protein-protein interfaces.
The prediction of hot spot residues is a difficult but significant problem. As we all know, alanine scanning
experiments are time consuming, labor-intensive, and
unfeasible on a large scale. Fortunately, computational
and theoretical approaches can predict protein-protein
interactions sites based on sequence or structure data
[22-38]. They can provide valuable information that are
complementary to experiments, and give insight into the
nature of macromolecular complexes association. Currently, these prediction methods are mainly based on
the differences between the characteristics of interface
and non-interface residues. However, these approaches
cannot predict what residues contribute significantly to
the binding free energy. The reason is that, there are no
general patterns of physicochemical features, such as
evolutionary conservation score, accessible surface area,
or secondary structure that can be used for predicting
hot spots [15,19,39,40]. Although hot spots cannot be
well explained through simple analysis based on the
physicochemical characteristics of protein complexes,
we still have reason to believe that more computational
and theoretical methods will successfully predict them.
Some approaches based on rigorous theoretical analysis,

but that are validated against the large body of available
experimental data, will eventually provide us with a
comprehensive understanding of hot spots. Even in
advance of such understanding, new experimental techniques will enable development of therapeutics that specifically target protein interfaces hot spots [17].
In recent years, with the growth of experimental data,
an increasing number of computational approaches have
been developed to predict hot spots in protein-protein
interfaces. One class is based on the energy such as
computational alanine scanning approach, which uses
free energy functions (including van der Waals potentials, electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonds, and desolvation energy) to calculate the change of binding free
energy [41-47]. A second class combines various features of residues with machine learning approaches.
Darnell et al [48,49] used decision tree approach to predict protein-protein interaction hot spots based on the
shape specificity and biochemical contact. Cho et al [50]
performed feature selection from 54 multifaceted features using decision tree, and then modeled protein-protein interaction hot spots using support vector machine.
Lise et al [20] developed a hybrid scheme to identify hot
spots. They considered the basic energy terms as input
features of machine learning models such as Support
Vector Machines and Gaussian Processes. This approach
combines the strengths of machine learning and energybased methods. In other approaches, Li et al [51] identified hot spot residues at protein-protein interface by
examining inter-sidechain interactions. Grosdidier et al
[52] predicted hot spots using Normalized Interface Propensity (NIP) values derived from rigid-body docking
simulations with electrostatics and desolvation scoring.
Finally, hot spots predictions from evolutionary information such as sequence profile and evolutionary conservation score have also been reported [29,39,53,54]. The
structural and physicochemical features are informative,
and it has been pointed out that each feature cannot
solely define hot spots.
Here, we develop a new method, sequence-based support vector machines (SVMs), to identify hot spots in
protein-protein interfaces. Different features are combined to improve the hot spots prediction performance.
These various features are extracted from protein
sequences and structures. It is found that the combination of sequence-based features surpasses other combinations in prediction performance. The structure-based
method has also relatively high predictive accuracy. We
compare our proposed method with other machine
learning models and two energy-based approaches. The
results demonstrate that our approach is remarkably
accurate than other approaches for identifying hot spots.
Specifically, our method achieves a precision of 0.69, a
recall of 0.68, an F1 score of 0.68, and an AUC of 0.68

Chen et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2011, 12:311
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/311

on independent test set, respectively. In two case studies, our approach outperforms two energy-based
approaches with high accuracy.
Additionally, we also analyze the distributions of some
features between hot spots and non-hot spots. Our
results show that lower relASA and larger relative
change in ASA are critical for hot spots distinguishing
from non-hot spots. In Ab+ dataset (all complexes), the
statistically differences in conservation score and
sequence entropy between hot spots and non-hot spots
are not significant. However in Ab- dataset (excluding
antigen-antibody complexes), there are significant differences. Interestingly, single conservation score or
sequence entropy is not a good feature discriminating
hot spots from non-hot spots. The performance is
remarkably improved when both of them are combined
with other features.

Methods
Training set

The data set includes 25 protein complexes whose
three-dimensional structures are available from Protein
Data Bank [55]. Alanine mutation data are collected
from the Alanine Scanning Energetics database
(ASEdb) [18], the Binding Interface databases (BID) [56]
and previous publications [57-62]. To ensure that our
data set is sufficiently diverse, we calculate the sequence
identity using the PISCES sequence culling server [63].
The sequence identity of at least one protein involved
less than 35% is required as in the procedure of previous
studies [48,64]. The resulting data set consists of 377
mutated interface residues from 25 protein complexes.
The 25 protein structures with resolution ≤3 Å in our
data set are listed in Additional file 1: Table S1. The ΔΔ
G values (the difference in binding energy between wildtype and mutated protein complex) are also reported in
Additional file 1: Table S1. The interface residues are
defined as those having ΔASA ≥1 Å2 as the definition
adopted by Cho [50]. When a residue with ΔΔ G ≥ 1
kcal.mol-1 is defined as a hot spot residue, 377 interface
residues contain 182 hot spots and 195 non-hot spots.
An independent test set

In order to validate our model, an independent test set
is collected from the BID. The test set is selected for
identical sequence in a similar manner to the training
set. Each protein structure has experimentally mutated
data but not with ΔΔ G values. In the BID, the effect of
a mutation is classified as Strong, Intermediate, Weak,
Insignificant, Negative-weak, or Negative-strong. When
both strong and intermediate mutations are considered
as hot spots, the test data contains 23 complexes including 148 alanine-mutated residues, of which 80 residues

Page 3 of 14

are hot spots and 68 residues are non-hot spots. The list
of test set is available in Additional file 2: Table S2.
Collection of features
Relative change in ASA and relASA

The solvent accessible surface area (ASA) of each residue is calculated using the program NACCESS [65]
with a probe ball radius of 1.4 Å. The ΔASA is the ASA
change of a residue upon protein complex formation
from monomer state, ΔASA = ASAmonomer - ASAcomplex,
the ASA of a residue in the monomer and complex
form, respectively. A residue with ΔASA≥1 Å2 is defined
as an interface residue. The relative change in ASA for a
residue is calculated as follows: ΔASA%= (ASAmonomer ASAcomplex )/ASAmonomer × 100%. A previous study also
referred to this relative surface area burial [50]. Those
absolute change in ASA (ΔASA) and solvent accessibility may distinguish hot spots from non-hot spots with a
limited capacity. Instead, we use this relative surface
burial, simply expressed as ΔASA%. The relative ASA
(relASA) of each residue in complex is calculated as the
accessibility compared to the accessibility of that residue
type in an extended ALA-x-ALA tripeptide (for amino
acids) [66].
Biochemical contacts

The WHAT IF Servers [67] is used to assess non-covalent interactions in protein complexes. Three types of
non-covalent interactions are recorded: hydrogen bonds,
salt bridges, and atomic contacts. A hydrogen bond is
identified by an optimizing hydrogen-bond networks
model [68]. The number of hydrogen bonds that a residue makes with its binding partner is regarded as the
residue’s hydrogen bond feature. If the distance between
a negative atom and a positive atom, one from each
side, is less than 7 Å, a salt bridge is evaluated. The
number of salt bridges that a residue contacts with its
binding partner is considered as the residue’s salt
bridges feature. If the distance between two atoms, one
from each side, is less than 0.25 Å, an atomic contact is
identified. Similarly, the number of atomic contacts
between a residue and its binding partner is regarded as
the residue’s atomic contacts feature. The biochemical
contacts feature has been used in [48] to predict hot
spots.
Physicochemical characteristics

The six physicochemical characteristics of an amino acid
are hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, polarity, polarizability, propensities, and average accessible surface area.
Deng et al have predicted the protein interaction sites
by the physicochemical features and other features [32].
The values of six physicochemical characteristics for
each residue are obtained from the AAindex database
[69,70].

Evolutionary conservation score

Evolutionary conservation score is based on the phylogenetic relations between its close sequence homologues. More conserved positions have higher scores. In
this study, we use the color scale to represent the conservation score (e.g. 9-conserved, 1-variable). The evolutionary conservation profiles are obtained from ConSurf
Server Database [71]. Similar amino acid sequences in
PDB [55] are collected by using PSI-BLAST [72,73] and
aligned using MUSCLE [74,75]. The evolutionary conservation of each amino acid position in the alignment
is calculated by the Rate4Site algorithm [76,77]. This
algorithm takes into account the phylogenetic relations
between the aligned proteins and the stochastic nature
of the evolutionary process.
Sequence entropy

Sequence entropy value for each residue is obtained
from HSSP database [78-81]. The sequence entropy
shows the conservation at each residue position in a
multiple alignment. Every value is normalized over the
range 0-100, and the lower sequence entropy values are,
the more conserved positions are [82].
Sequence profile

Sequence profile is obtained by PSI-BLAST [72] searching against NCBI non-redundant database. The BLOSUM62 substitution matrix and E-value threshold of
0.001 are chosen as parameters. In other words,
sequence profile is a Position-Specific Scoring Matrix
(PSSM), which is a type of scoring matrix and taken
from multiple sequence alignment. In this matrix, amino
acid substitution scores are given separately for each
position in a protein multiple sequence alignment.
PSSM scores are generally shown as positive or negative
integers. Positive scores indicate that the given amino
acid substitution occurs more frequently in the alignment than expected by chance, while negative scores
indicate that the substitution occurs less frequently than
expected. The profile value is normalized in the range
0-1 according to the proposed method by Kim et al [83]:
⎧
if x ≤ −5
⎨ 0.0
(1)
f (x) = 0.5 + 0.1x if −5 < x < 5
⎩
1.0
if x ≥ 5
Wherex is the original value from position specific
scoring matrix.
Support vector machine models

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) [84] are a class of
supervised learning algorithms, and can learn a linear
decision boundary to discriminate different classes with
maximum margin. In bioinformatics and computational
biology areas, SVMs have received more and more
attentions. For example, SVMs have been applied in the

prediction of protein interaction sites and hot spots
[20,32,34,36,50].
In the standard SVM, the decision function sgnf((wx)

In our experiment, SVM classifiers are constructed
using each feature or the combinations of different features. And we find that the best results are obtained
with the radial basis function as the kernel and a set of
sequence-based features. The SVM classifiers are
implemented on Matlab platform. For each classifier,
we use a grid search to determine the optimal values
of regularization parameters C and g. The predictive
performance of our approach is evaluated by self-consistency test and ten-fold cross-validation test on training set. Also, we validate our approach on an
independent data set.
Evaluation of prediction results

Firstly, the predictive performance of the proposed
method is evaluated by self-consistency test on training
set. Then, 10-fold cross -validation test is used to evaluate the performance of our method. The data set is randomly divided into ten equal subsets. For each time,
nine subsets are used as training data and the remaining
subset is used as test data. The following measures are
used to evaluate the performance: precision, recall, F1
score, and AUC.
Precision (P) = TP/ (TP + FP)

(5)

Recall (R) = TP/ (TP + FN)

(6)

F1 = 2PR/ (P + R)

(7)

In above equations, TP, FN, TN, and FP are true positives, false negatives, true negatives, and false positives,
respectively. Precision is the fraction of predicted hot
spots that are true hot spots. Recall is the fraction of
true positive hot spots that are predicted hot spots. F1
score is a measure to balance recall and precision rates.
In addition, we plot receiver operating characteristics
(ROC) curve to evaluate performance. A ROC curve is
plotted with true positives rate versus false positives rate
for different classification thresholds. The normalized
area under a ROC curve (AUC) can measure the classifier’s performance.

Results
Statistics on the relASA

The distributions of relASA for each reside in hot spots
and non-hot spots are calculated. The average relASA of
each amino acid in hot spots and non-hot spots is
shown in Figure 1. Because other amino acids are
mutated into alanine, alanine doesn’t appear in our data
set. In 19 common amino acids, only G doesn’t appear
in non-hot spots of our data set. As shown in Figure 1,
except I, Y, and C, the average relASA of each residue
in hot spots is lower than that of each residue in nonhot spots. Our results are in good agreement with previous studies, which indicates that hot spots are buried
in the complexes (lowASA) [21]. Bogan & Thorn [14],
in their influential study hot spot anatomy, noted that
hot spots tend to cluster in the center of the interface
rather than at the rim, and largely protected from contact with bulk solvent.
Statistics on relative change in ASA

Figure 2 The relative change of each amino acid in hot spots
and non-hot spots. For each type of residue, its average
percentage of change in ASA in hot spots or non-hot spots is
shown.

Statistics on biochemical contacts

We analyze the relative difference in ASA for each residue type in hot spots and non-hot spots. The results are
shown in Figure 2. We find that except G, L and C, the
average percentages of change in ASA for hot spots are
higher than that of non-hot spots. This suggests that the
degree of change in ASA for hot spot residues is stronger. After protein-protein binding, the hot spot residues
may disappear on the surface and participate in contacting with residues from partners. Cho el at [50] have
chosen this feature to study proteins interaction hot
spots, and found that relative surface area burial can distinguish hot spots from non-hot spots.

We only focus on three kinds of biochemical contacts:
hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and atomic contacts. As
can be seen from Figure 3, the average numbers of
three classes for hot spots are higher than those of nonhot spots. Hydrogen bonds and salt bridges contribute
significantly to the binding free energy. As we all know,
electrostatics interactions owe to salt bridges forming.
Electrostatics energy and hydrogen energy are important
energy terms in free energy calculation.

Figure 1 Averages of relASA for amino acids in hot spots and
non-hot spots. For each type of residue, the average value of its
relative ASA in hot spots or non-hot spots is calculated. In 19 amino
acids, only G doesn’t appear in non-hot spots of our dataset.

Figure 3 The biochemical contacts in hot spots and non-hot
spots. The average number of biochemical contacts in hot spots or
non-hot spots including hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and atomic
contacts is shown respectively.

Statistics on the distributions of amino acids

The distributions of amino acids in hot spots and non-hot
spots are shown in Figure 4. Amino acid residues F, P, I, L,
and W appear more frequently in hot spots. This indicates

Figure 4 Distributions of 19 amino acids in hot spots and nonhot spots. For each type of residue, its percentage among all the
residues that are designated as hot spots or non-hot spots is
displayed

that hot spot residues are more likely to be hydrophobic.
This is consistent with the O-ring hypothesis that bulk solvent is occluded from hot spots [14]. Amino acids S, T, N,
and Q occur more frequently in non-hot spots. This indicates that non-hot spots are more likely to be polar. However, polar residue Y is exceptional, and hot spots are
enriched in Y. Amino acid Y can form aromatic π-interactions, and has large hydrophobic surface. In addition, Y is
capable of forming one hydrogen bond. Hot spots are also
abundant in charged residues D and R. Both of residues
can form salt bridges across protein-protein interfaces. As
shown in Figure 3, the average number of salt bridges for
hot spots is larger than that of salt bridges for non-hot
spots.

averages for hot spots and non-hot spots are 4.46 and
4.08, respectively. The statistically difference in conservation score between hot spots and non-hot spots is
insignificant (p -value = 0.14). It is probably that Ab+
dataset includes antigen-antibody complexes, and antibodies must be diversified and easily mutated to recognize externally different antigens. Therefore,
evolutionary conservation score may not be a better predictor in distinguishing hot spots from non-hot spots
only by itself. Interestingly, when analyzing Ab- dataset
(excluding antigen-antibody complexes), we find that
the difference in conservation score between hot spots
and non-hot spots is statistically significant (p-value =
10-4). The mean values for hot spots and non-hot spots
are 5.63 and 4.28, respectively. In this case, hot spots
are more conserved than non-hot spots. These results
are displayed in Figure 5a. But the evolutionary information is insufficient to predict hot spots in protein interfaces. It can combine with other features to improve the
predictive performance of models.
Statistics on the sequence entropy

We also analyze sequence entropy. As can be seen from
Figure 5b, not only Ab+ dataset but also Ab- dataset
has the similar trend, that is the mean value of sequence
entropy for hot spots is lower than that of sequence
entropy for non-hot spots. In Ab+ dataset, the p-value
of the difference in sequence entropy is 0.36 (Table 1),
which indicates that this feature doesn’t differ significantly between hot spots and non-hot spots. In Abdataset, however p-value for sequence entropy is 1.1 ×
10 -3 , implying the difference between hot spots and
non-hot spots is statistically significant.
Training SVM models for different feature combinations

Statistics on the evolutionary information

In general, hot spot residues are more conserved than
non-hot spot residues. However, our results show that
hot spots are not more conserved than non-hot spot
residues (Table 1). In Ab+ dataset (all complexes), the

In many studies on predictions of protein interaction
sites, different features have been combined to improve
the performance of models. These features combinations
are as follows: evolutionary profile and accessible surface
area (ASA) [85]; physicochemical features, evolutionary

conservation score, amino acid distance and position
specific scoring matrix (PSSM) [33]; sequence profile
and evolutionary rate [23]; PSSM, ASA, and normalized
atom contacts [32]; ASA, secondary structure, conservation score, and sequence/spatial distance [36]; temperature factor, sequence profile, and ASA [34]. On the
other hand, predictions of hot spots with structurebased or sequence-based methods are also paid more
attention. Gao et al analyzed hot spot residues at protein-protein interfaces by using hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic, and van der Waals interaction [86]. Grosdidier
and Fernandez-recio applied computational docking to
identify hot spots [52]. A good example of sequencebased methods is the one proposed by Ofran and Rost
[29]. In their experiment, evolutionary profile, predicted
secondary structure, and accessibility to the solvent
were combined to predict hot spots. All features were
generated from amino acid sequences, suggesting that
hot spots have been carved into sequence information
without structure features. There are many studies with
combinations of structure-based features, sequencebased features, and physicochemical features [48,50,87].
Following above mentioned publications, we combine
different features to train predictive models. Moreover,
we compare single feature models to illustrate the discrimination performance of each feature. In total the
training set comprises 377 mutations, of which 182
mutations correspond to hot spots. We train different
SVM classifiers with different feature combinations. As
we know, the structure information sometimes cannot
be obtained since many structures of proteins have not
been resolved. In PDB, there are 68,840 structures until
Oct 26 th , 2010. On the other hand, the evolutionary
information is also unavailable if homologous proteins
don’t exist. To handle this problem of incomplete information, we construct two models: sequence-based SVM
model and structure-based SVM model. The sequencebased model utilizes physicochemical features, PSSM,
evolutionary conservation score, and sequence entropy,
which comprises no structure information. And the
structure-based model uses physicochemical features,
ASA, and biochemical contacts without sequence information. The prediction results are compared by precision (P), recall (R), F1-score (F1), and AUC (area under
ROC curve). In our work, F1 and AUC bear importance,
since F1 score measures the balance precision and recall
rates and AUC is independent of any decision threshold.
The detailed results of self-consistency test on training
set are listed in Table 2, and the ROC curves are displayed in Figure 6. The results of 10-fold cross-validation test are reported in Table 3, and the ROC curves
are displayed in Figure 7. On 10-fold cross-validation
test, we try many other feature combinations, but only
give the better results.

It can be seen that evolutionary conservation score
plays a less important role in predicting hot spots.
When compared with other features or feature combinations, the results obtained only from this feature are
the least successful, with F1 = 0.33 and AUC = 0.59
with self-consistency test on training set. And on 10fold cross-validation test, the F1 is 0.34 and the AUC is

sequence entropy, there is at least 55% increase in F1
and 37% increase in AUC on self-consistency test. Similarly, the F1 increases from 0.34 to 0.65 and the AUC
increases from 0.51 to 0.68 on 10-fold cross-validation
test. Among sequence-based feature combinations, this
feature combination mentioned above outperforms
other sequence features combinations. The accessible
surface area (ASA) feature performs better in predicting
hot spots both on self-consistency test (F1 = 0.68 and
AUC = 0.72) and 10-fold cross-validation test (F1 = 0.61
and AUC = 0.62). This suggests that a hot spot residue

must be protected from bulk solvent (low relASA) [14],
and might have largely relative change in ASA [50]. To
our enjoyment, the combination of ASA, biochemical
contacts, and physicochemical features performs better
than feature ASA alone. The AUC has 5% and 8%
increase on self-consistency test and 10-fold cross-validation test, respectively. The other feature related to
structure is biochemical contacts. This term comprises
hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and atom contacts. Hot
spots have more biochemical contacts than non-hot
spots, because they contribute significantly to the binding free energy of complexes. The combination of ASA,
biochemical contacts, and physicochemical features
obtains the best performance among structure-based
feature combinations. The F1 and AUC of this combination are 0.68 and 0.77 on self-consistency test, respectively. On 10-fold cross-validation test, this combination
also obtains better results (F1 = 0.61 and AUC = 0.70).
In conclusion, the sequence-based model obtains better
performance both on self-consistency test (F1 = 0.88
and AUC = 0.96) and 10-fold cross-validation test (F1 =
0.65 and AUC = 0.68); the structure-based model is
inferior both on self-consistency test (F1 = 0.68 and
AUC = 0.77) and 10-fold cross-validation test (F1 = 0.61
and AUC = 0.70). The combination of all six features
also obtains a better performance with F1 = 0.84 and
AUC = 0.91 on self-consistency test. And on 10-fold
cross-validation test, all features model achieves the best
performance (F1 = 0.66 and AUC = 0.72). The analyses
above indicate that, there is no single feature that makes
a dominant contribution. Rather, it seems that the features in different combinations are complementary, and
that the exploration of these complementarities might
be very helpful for probing hot spots. It also supports
the claim that there are no general patterns of hydrophobicity, shape or charge that can be used to easily
detect hot spots [15,17].
We have also computed the contribution ratio of each
feature in sequence-based model on 10-fold cross-validation test. Deleting one feature at a time can lead to
some decrease in F1 score (see Table 4). Among
excluded features, the physicochemical feature can make
more decrease in F1 (ΔF = 0.06). The evolutionary

conservation score shows a less contribution ratio in
sequence-based model (ΔF = 0.01).
Comparison with other methods on independent test set

To further validate the effectiveness of this sequencebased SVM approach, we compare our predictions with
the predictions of other machine learning approaches
on the same test set. This independent test set is
obtained from Binding Interface Database (BID) [56],
and contains 80 hot spots and 68 non-hot spots. These
machine learning approaches are implemented on Weka
platform [88]. We report the detailed results in Table 5.
As observed from comparisons among these machine
learning methods, the best prediction, in terms of F1
score, is achieved with RBFNNetwork method (F1 =
0.66). Nevertheless, these machine learning methods do
not outperform SVMs approach (F1 = 0.68). The reason
behind the differences of predictive performance possibly lies in the unbalanced distribution of two classes
and the inapplicability of data set to some methods.
Comparing with previously related studies on hot
spots prediction is difficult, probably because data sets,
hot spots definition, and evaluation measures are different. Moreover, it’s not fair to compare the predictive
power of methods based only on the quoted results.
Therefore, we compare our prediction results with two
energy-based methods Robetta [41] and FOLDEF [45],
which are available via the internet on their web servers.
The Robetta method is designed to predict the actual
value of ΔΔG on the basis of a free energy function. In
the original study, predicted and experimental hot spots
are defined as those residues with ΔΔG ≥1 kcal.mol-1.
We adopt this definition of a hot spot when training
our model. The FOLD-X energy function (FOLDEF)
method is developed to estimate the importance of the
interactions which contribute to the stability of proteins
and protein complexes. This method utilizes a full
atomic description of the structure of the proteins. Also,
it is based on energy function that takes into account
different energy terms and predicts the change in
Table 5 Prediction results of machine-learning methods
on independent test set

interaction energy [45]. In FOLDEF computation results,
a threshold of 1 kcal.mol-1 is used to define predicted
hot spots. The predicted results on independent test set
are listed in Table 6. The F1 score is an effective metric
to balance precision and recall rates, and gauges the
relationship between them. The predictive performance
of Robetta on independent test set is as follows: P =
0.66, R = 0.49 and F1 = 0.56. The FOLDEF method
achieves an inferior result, with P = 0.50, R = 0.44 and
F1 = 0.47. The sequence-based SVM method has the
best results (F1 = 0.68). Cho’s method gets the F1 of
0.57 on independent test set for the hot spots definitions
of ΔΔG ≥1 kcal.mol-1.
Prediction examples

The X-ray crystal structure of a complex of EMP1 with
the extracellular domain of the erythropoietin (EPO)
receptor (EPO binding protein, EBP) (PDB: 1EBP) was
previously reported by Livnah et al [89]. EMP1 is a peptide that is one of a series of related peptides discovered
by phage display methodology, and possesses effective
erythropoietin (EPO) mimetic action. Erythropoietin
(EPO) is a hormone which regulates the cell proliferation and differentiation. EPO competes with EMP1 for
receptor binding. Four residues in EPO receptor were
analyzed through alanine scanning mutagenesis, and
three out of four were found to be important for binding [90]. Experimentally identified hot spot residues in
EPO receptor are F93, M150 and F205. T151 is experimentally assayed as a non-hot spot residue (from BID).
The sequence-based SVM approach predicts two of
three hot spots correctly (F93 and F205) and one nonhot spot (T151, see Figure 8a). While only one hot spot
is incorrectly predicted as non-hot spot (M150). This
corresponds to a better result with P = 1, R = 0.67, and
F1 = 0.8. However, Robetta and FOLDEF methods predict M150 as hot spot correctly and other residues as
non-hot spots.
A second example is the protein complex formed by
beta-catenin and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)
(PDB: 1JPP) [91]. Beta-catenin is a cytosolic protein
which has essential roles in cell adhesion and in the
Wnt signaling pathway. The adenomatous polyposis coli

Red residues are actual hot spots predicted correctly. Blue residues

spot predicted as hot spot.

(APC) tumor suppressor protein plays a critical role in
regulating cellular levels of the oncogene product betacatenin [92]. Beta-catenin has six experimentally identified hot spots (K345, W383, R386, K435, R469, and
H470) and one non-hot spot (K354). Among seven residues, K345, K354, W383, and R386 form a cluster;
K435, R469, and H470 form another cluster. Five of the
six residues as hot spots (K345, W383, R386, K435, and
R469) are predicted correctly, and one hot spot is incorrectly predicted as non-hot spot (H470). Whereas, one
non-hot spot residue are incorrectly predicted as a hot
spot (K354) (see Figure 8b). Our approach achieves a
result with P = 0.83, R = 0.83, and F1 = 0.83. Robetta
identifies all seven residues as non-hot spots. FOLDEF
predicts K435 as a hot spot correctly and the rest as
non-hot spots.

Discussion
Many studies on the same problem of hot spots prediction have been published in the past years
[20,40,48,50,64]. In these publications, hot spots are
defined as those alanine mutations for which ΔΔG ≥2
kcal.mol-1. With this definition, our original training set
comprises 84 hot spots and 293 non-hot spots. As mentioned above, comparing different approaches based on
the quoted results is problematic as the definition of hot
spots, data sets and evaluation measures used differ. It is
not entirely fair to assess which methods perform better.
Taking the Robetta for example, this method achieves
F1 = 0.47 on our new training set (a threshold of ΔΔG
≥ 2 kcal.mol -1 ). The reported F1 score of Robetta in
[20,48,50] and [64] on their respective training set are
0.49, 0.49, 0.55 and 0.59, respectively. This suggests that
there will be different results with the same method on

Page 10 of 14

different training sets. Because of many differences,
these methods can not be compared directly on the
basis of the obtained results alone. Nonetheless, for
completeness we compare our approach with two recent
publications [50,64], Robetta and FOLDEF. The results
are reported in Table 7. On the 2 kcal.mol-1 training set,
for the balance of data set we train our sequence-based
method on the training set containing 84 hot spots and
84 selected non-hot spot with a lower ΔΔG. The predictive performance of our method has been estimated to
be P = 0.78, R = 0.80 and F1 = 0.79 on 10-fold crossvalidation test. On training set, the sequence-based
SVM achieves the best results (F1 = 0.79). While on
independent test set, Tuncbag’s method [64] obtains a
better performance with F1 = 0.65. The results for
sequence-based method appear comparable to those
reported in Tuncbag’s paper. While Cho’s method performs better than two energy-based methods both on
training set and independent test set.
Through comparisons of the results for different models, the sequence-based method has been found that its
predictive performance is comparable to that of all features used method. However, the sequence-based model
comprises only physicochemical features, position specific scoring matrix (PSSM), evolutionary conservation
score, and sequence entropy without structure information. These features may be complementary, contain
more hot spots’ information, and depict the nature of
hot spot residues. Thus, they can predict hot spots with
better predictive performance. In a recent study [93],
Westhead et al have shown that simple sequence-based
features contain insufficient information and do not predict protein-protein interactions. However, these
sequence features used in our work are not simple
amino acid sequence, and they are derived from
sequences.
We note that the evolutionary conservation score may
not be a better predictor in distinguishing hot spots
from non-hot spots by itself. In Ab+ dataset (all

complexes), the statistically difference in conservation
score between hot spots and non-hot spots is insignificant (p-value = 0.14). However, the difference in conservation score between hot spots and non-hot spots is
statistically significant (p-value = 10-4) in Ab- dataset
(excluding antigen-antibody complexes). When combined with other features, they can predict hot spots
with better performance. As mentioned above, these features may be complementary and provide more amount
of information. The predictive performance of the
model based on evolutionary conservation score feature
has been analyzed in Ab+ dataset (F1 = 0.34). Additionally, we have analyzed the predictive performance of the
conservation score based method in Ab- dataset (F1 =
0.45, the data isn’t listed). This suggests that evolutionary conservation score is not a good predictor when
considering antigen-antibody complexes. As we all
know, antibodies are easily mutated and diversified to
neutralize various antigens.
We have analyzed the propensities of hot spots in
antibody-antigen complexes and antibody proteins. In
antibody-antigen complexes, hot spots are abundant in
W, Y, and Q. While in antibody proteins, hot spots are
enriched in I, N, and Q. Because there is a small number of antibody-antigen complexes in alanine scanning
databank. These analyses are only based on our collecting data set. With the increase of alanine scanning data
for antibody-antigen complexes, we may predict the hot
spots in antibody-antigen complexes in the future.
In order to compare different models on a baseline,
we have randomly selected 182 residues as hot spots
from 377 interface residues and the rest are labeled as
non-hot spots. With 10-fold cross-validation test, we
have performed 10 times in whole experiment, and
computed the equal value of each evaluation measure.
The results are listed in Table 8. The F1 of sequencebased SVM is higher than that of random model (Δ F1
= 0.17) on 10-fold cross-validation test, and the difference is statistically significant (p-value = 0.003). Similarly, the F1 of structure-based SVM and all features
SVM are also higher than that of random model (Δ F1
= 0.13 and 0.18, p-value = 0.02 and 0.002). These results
indicate that three models obtain better predictive performance compared with a random model. Among
these three models, all features-based SVM achieves the

Conclusions
In this work, we have presented a computational
method, sequence-based SVM which combines strengths
of machine learning and sequence information, to identify hot spots in protein-protein interfaces. The properties characterizing hot spot residues are various, and are
not completely utilized by any one model [48]. Firstly,
we analyzed the distributions of some features between
hot spots and non-hot spots. We found that hot spots
have lower relASA and larger relative change in ASA,
suggesting hot spots tend to be protected from bulk solvent. With respect to biochemical contacts, hot spots
have more contacts including hydrogen bonds, salt
bridges, and atomic contacts, which favoring complexes
formation. Not only conservation score but also
sequence entropy doesn’t differ significantly between hot
spots and non-hot spots in Ab+ dataset. When antigenantibody complexes are removed, there are significant
differences in two features between hot pots and nonhot spots (p-value = 10-4 for conservation score and pvalue = 1.1 × 10-3 for sequence entropy).
The combinations of different features have been
explored as input vectors of machine learning method
such as SVMs. We have noted that the sequence-based
SVM approach exceeds other combinations of different
features, with P = 0.69, R = 0.68, F1 = 0.68, and AUC =
0.68 on independent test set. Compared with several
machine learning approaches, the sequence-based SVM
approach is superior for identifying hot spots with reasonably predictive performance. In addition, the presented method is shown to exceed the prediction
powers of two energy-based hot spots prediction
approaches, for example, the Robetta and FOLDEF
methods. Finally, we report two prediction examples:
EMP1/EPO receptor complex and beta-catenin/adenomatous polyposis coli complex. The results indicate that
our approach outperforms two energy-based approaches
with high performance.
The sequence-based SVM method we have outlined
here will assist in exploring protein interfaces and is a
valuable tool capable of selecting target residues for alanine mutation, which is a complement to experimental
investigation. This approach can predict hot spots without prior structural knowledge of the complex. Encouragingly, two previous studies have been reported in
predicting hot spots based on sequence information
[29,52]. Future progress depends as much on the application of novel computational approaches for analyzing
protein interfaces and expanding the databank of alanine
mutation [17]. Although systematic mutagenesis is currently expensive and time-consuming to perform, it is

Chen et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2011, 12:311
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/311

conceivable that recent developments in these aspects
may greatly accelerate the process. On other hand, hot
spots cannot be explained through simple analysis based
on physicochemical characteristics, but there is reason
to believe that more thorough computational
approaches will succeed in capturing their essence [17].
For the future work, more efficient features will be
explored and many machine learning methods will be
used. The integration of features and machine learning
methods will provide important insights in the field of
drug discovery.
