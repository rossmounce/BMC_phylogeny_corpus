The CRF domain defines Cytokinin Response Factor
proteins in plants
Research article

Abstract
Background: Cytokinin Response Factors (CRFs) are a small subset of AP2/ERF transcription factor genes shown in
Arabidopsis to regulate leaf development as part of the cytokinin signal transduction pathway. This study examines the
phylogenetic distribution of CRF genes in other plant species, and attempts to identify the extent of sequence
conservation and potential gene function among all CRF genes.
Results: We identified CRF genes in representatives of all major land plant lineages, including numerous flowering
plant taxa in addition to the model systems in which ERF genes have been catalogued. Comparative analysis across this
broader sampling has identified strongly conserved amino acid motifs other than the AP2/ERF domain for all CRF
proteins as well as signature sequences unique to specific clades of CRF genes. One of these motifs, here designated as
the CRF domain, is conserved in and unique to CRF proteins distinguishing them from related genes. We show that this
novel domain of approximately 65 amino acids is found in CRF proteins from all groups of land plants and only in CRF
genes. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that the evolution of CRF genes has included numerous duplication events. In
this phylogenetic context we examine protein evolution including the gain and loss of accessory domains, correlate
these molecular evolutionary events with experimental data on cytokinin regulation and speculate on the function
and evolution of the CRF domain within AP2/ERF transcription factor proteins. We also tested a prediction drawn from
the phylogenetic analyses that four CRF domain containing genes from Tomato, previously unexamined for cytokinin
response, are transcriptionally inducible by cytokinin, supporting the link between CRF genes, CRF-specific domains
and cytokinin regulation.
Conclusion: CRF genes can be identified in all lineages of land plants, as a distinct subset of AP2/ERF proteins
containing a specific and unique CRF domain. The CRF domain can be used to identify previously unclassified
predicted genes or genes identified only as members of the AP2/ERF protein family. CRF domain presence and
phylogenetic relatedness to known Arabidopsis CRF genes predicts gene function to some extent.
Background
AP2/ERF proteins comprise one of the largest families of
transcription factors in plants and are defined by the
presence of an AP2 DNA binding domain of around 68
amino acids. This protein family can be broadly divided
into those proteins with two AP2 domains, e.g. the eponymous floral patterning gene APETELA2, and those with
a single AP2 domain such as the Ethylene Response Factors (ERFs) [1-5]. To date, all of the proteins containing a
canonical AP2 DNA binding domain have been identified
in land plants, but more divergent AP2 homologues have

been hypothesized for cyanobacteria, ciliates and viruses
[3,6]. The AP2 DNA binding domain has been shown to
interact with slightly varied DNA sequences depending
on its exact composition e.g. DREB subfamily members
have been shown to bind DRE/CRT cis-acting elements
and ERF subfamily members have been shown to bind
GCC box cis-acting elements [2,7]. Through these interactions AP2/ERF genes control a variety of developmental and environmental response processes in plants.
The ERF subfamily comprises the majority of all AP2/
ERF proteins in Arabidopsis (83%), rice and other
sequenced plant genomes. They are further distinguished
from single AP2 domain-containing proteins by the
absence of a B3 domain, a feature reserved for the class of
genes designated as RAV proteins [2,5,8]. Through

whole-genome analyses of Arabidopsis, Populus and rice,
the ERF subfamily has been divided into 12 more or less
distinct subgroups [2,5,8,9]. Several genes in Arabidopsis
from the ERF subgroup B-5 (also known as subgroup VI)
have recently been identified as cytokinin regulated transcription factors or CRFs [10]. Although CRF genes have
been examined in a preliminary way in Arabidopsis and
homologs have been identified in rice there has been little
done to establish their presence at a broader phylogenetic
scale or to examine basic aspects of molecular evolution
such as potentially conserved motifs within these proteins.
In this study we set out to better understand the function of CRFs and CRF related proteins in other species,
we have examined in detail the protein sequence of these
group members and compared them to similar proteins
in rice and a wide range of other plant species. These
analyses have identified two domains other than the AP2
binding domain that are commonly present in these protein sequences, including one domain that is specific to
this group of proteins and conserved throughout land
plants. We have designated this novel group-specific
domain the CRF domain and further analyzed it in proteins from numerous plant taxa. The presence of this
domain in all land plant lineages has allowed an evolutionarily broad consensus sequence to be defined. Using
this consensus sequence we have been able to further
classify several ERF genes as belonging to the CRF subgroup, and show that four such CRF genes in Tomato previously unexamined for cytokinin response are cytokinin
inducible. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of these
sequences, their relationship to the AP2 domain, and
evolutionary implications are discussed.

Results
We have identified a large number (over 100) of AP2/ERF
genes from diverse land plant lineages that are orthologous to a set of genes from Arabidopsis known as Cytokinin Response Factors or CRFs.
Sequence analysis and alignment of CRF genes or genes
containing a CRF domain, as designated below, was initiated with the six previously identified CRF genes from
Arabidopsis, CRF1-6, and two closely related Arabidopsis
genes, At1 g71130 and At1 g22985, that we now designate
CRF7 and CRF8, respectively. These sequences in addition to previously identified CRF gene homologs from
Rice, as seen in Nakano et al., 2006 [8], allowed us to generate a basic consensus sequence that we used to gather
further CRF sequences through a series of BLAST analyses. Additional searches with a representative species
sequence within genus or specific genome sequencing
efforts allowed us to generate a broader CRF protein consensus sequence, the CRF domain of which is presented
in Figure 1. Sequences are identified simply by their

generic name followed by a number if more than one was
identified per genus, unless previously designated a name
or for the Solanum lycopersicum or SlCRFs (SlCRF1 also
previously designated as PTI6 is from SGN-U314347,
SlCRF2 is from SGN-U329134, SlCRF3 is from SGNU344182, and SlCRF4 is from SGN-U331355), with full
gene names included see Additional File 1. These results
show that CRF genes are present throughout land plants
and always consist of a novel N-terminal CRF motif/
domain, an AP2-DNA binding domain near the middle of
the protein, and in roughly half of the sequences a putative kinase phosphorylation site in the C-terminal region.
CRF Protein Domains

The AP2 domain as has been previous detailed for CRF
protein members is centered on the base amino acid
sequence AAEIRD**RR*R*WLGT*DTAEEAA where the
underlined WLG amino acids are absolutely required for
AP2/ERF domain binding to DNA and the * represent
non-specifically conserved amino acids [2,8].
While the specific sequence found in CRF protein
members for this domain is quite similar to previously
described alignments using ERF proteins from Arabidopsis and Rice, as seen in Nakano et al., 2006 [8], we have
shown it to be present far beyond these two species, in
fact occurring throughout land plants. While AP2
domains in general maintain a number of conserved
amino acids that are required for their function, there is
also specificity within a domain that can in some cases
determine DNA sequence binding specificity. A prime
example is the difference between the conserved amino
acid sequence VAEIRE from the CBF/DREB subfamily of
ERF proteins and AAEIRD from the ERF subfamily
resulting in binding to DRE/CRT or GCC box cis-elements respectively [2]. The sequence of the AP2 domain
found in this study of CRF proteins, indicates that they
belong to the ERF protein subfamily, but also indicates a
higher level of specificity within this group.
We have also identified a novel domain of approximately 65 amino acids that is present in all CRF proteins
throughout all land plants, that we have designated as the
CRF domain. The consensus sequence of this domain
along with a sequence alignment from representative species is shown in Figure 1, broken into two parts the core
CRF domain of about 40AA (Figure 1B) and the TEH
region of about 13 AA that precedes the core domain in
nearly all sequences belonging to the TEH clade of CRF
genes (Figure 1C, Figure 2).
The CRF domain is found in the N-terminal region of
the protein and is always accompanied by an AP2-DNA
binding domain, roughly 60 AA C-terminal to the CRF
domain position (Fig 1A). Therefore, CRF domain containing proteins, or CRF proteins are a subset of AP2/ERF
proteins. We have identified CRF domain proteins in liv-

erworts, mosses, lycopods, ferns, conifers and all major
lineages of flowering plants. CRF domain containing
genes were not found in any species of green algae including the completely sequenced genomes of Chlamydomonas, Micromonas (2 spp.) and Ostreococcus, despite the
presence of clearly identifiable AP2/ERF domain proteins
in these genomes. Additionally, while highly divergent
AP2/ERF-like domains have been detected in some bacteria, no recognizable CRF domains were found in any
sequence searches outside of the land plants mentioned
above, suggesting that they are unique in their occurrence
within this group.
In an attempt to ascribe a specific function to the CRF
domain, we performed a motif analysis of the CRF
domain sequence. This revealed no similarity to any
motifs or domains of known function. The best similarity
identified in BLAST analysis, which is very weak, is to the
C-terminal region of potassium voltage-gated channel
subfamily S member 3 proteins Kv9.3 such as KCNS3
from Humans. However, the region of similarity on the
potassium channel protein resides at the very end of the
C-terminal of the protein that is not involved in channel
structure, protein-protein interaction, or potassium
movement, but is in a variable region of unknown func-

tion [11]. There is within the C-terminal region of the
CRF domain a stretch of amino acids rich in lysines and
arginines, which in are often involved in nuclear localization of proteins. However, there is no apparent alignment
of amino acids in the CRF domain that corresponds to
such known nuclear localization signal. A best guess at
CRF domain function from a basic analysis of the eight
members with a CRF domain that have any ascribed
function, would suggest a role in cytokinin regulation,
since the six CRFs from Arabidopsis appear to be regulated by that hormone [10]. It is also possible that the
CRF domain may be connected to pathogen resistance, as
two (non Arabidopsis) CRF domain genes, Pti6 from
tomato and Tsi1 from tobacco, have been linked to pathogen resistance in gene overexpression studies [12-14].
Another possibility is that the CRF domain functions as a
protein-protein interaction domain, allowing CRF
domain containing proteins to form hetero or homodimers with each other or themselves.
One other small motif: SP(T/V)SVL was identified in
roughly half of the CRF proteins for which we have identified full-length sequences. While a part of this motif has
been previously noted for a few species we found that this
conserved six AA motif occurs in CRF genes across a

broad range of land plants including Selaginella [8,9].
This motif is predicted to function as a putative MAP
kinase phosphorylation site [8,9]. Unlike the CRF
domain, the SP(T/V)SVL motif is not specifically linked
to either the AP2 or CRF domains (Figure 1). This SP(T/
V)SVL motif can be found in 33 other non-CRF proteins
in Arabidopsis alone with a variety of functions, including
several different types of transcription factors. Interestingly, about half of the genes whose protein contains this
domain have also been shown to have altered expression
through cytokinin treatment or in a cytokinin mutant
background, suggesting that CRF proteins in general may
have a role in cytokinin response (Additional File 2).
Phylogenetic Analysis of CRF proteins

CRF proteins from a wide range of land plant lineages can
be readily aligned at the protein sequence level and were
submitted to various phylogenetic analyses. This result is
shown in the neighbor joining (NJ) tree in Figure 2 with
species denoted as is Figure 1 and full gene names
included in Additional File 1. In this tree there are two
distinct clades that we have denoted as A and B, each of
which contain sequences from diverse flowering plant
lineages, with sequences from the relatively earlier
branching land plant lineages at the base of the tree. This
division of CRF genes into A and B clades is coincident
with the presence or absence of a specific set of amino
acids in the beginning of the CRF domain, here referred
to as the TEH region. The TEH region of the CRF domain
is well conserved and unique, found only in the CRF
domains of clade A proteins, with some variability in size
and sequence (Figure 1).
Within individual plant species, A clade, TEH proteins
appear to be about twice as numerous as B clade: Arabidopsis (8 A clade members: 4 B clade members), Rice (6
A clade: 3 B clade), Vitis (6 A clade: 4 B clade), Populus (8
A clade: 3 B clade). Not surprisingly, A clade CRF
sequences are identified in BLAST analyses roughly twice
as frequently as those B clade members without a TEH
region. A somewhat similar distinction of clades was
observed in a cluster analysis using only the AP2 domain
of all ERF proteins in Arabidopsis and separately in Rice
(Nakano et al., 2006). In these studies the 'A clade' members in each species were identified as part of one of the
major subgroups of ERF proteins (group VI) with the 'B
clade' proteins being relegated to a smaller, related or like
group to these members (group VI-L). The within-clade
similarity of amino acid sequence across either the AP2
or CRF domain is quite marked and easily discerned by
eye.
As there has not been a previous analysis of CRF
domain proteins containing monocots and eudicots, it is
interesting to note that within the distinct A and B clades
there is an additional, clear division of sequences between

Page 5 of 10

monocots and eudicots, particular true for the CRF proteins in clade A (Figure 2). In clade B this appears to also
be the general rule, with the one exception of a 'misplaced' Vitis CRF sequence.
The clustering analyses suggest that a number of duplication events accompanied the phylogenetic history of
CRF proteins. The particularly striking A/B clade duplication appears to predate the divergence of monocots,
magnoliids and eudicots, but happened at some point
after the origin of flowering plants. Within each of the A
and B clades there are additional duplication events that
occurred prior to the branching off of the eudicots, leaving multiple clades of rosid, asterid and caryophyllid
sequences in each. Finally, there are a number of species
specific duplications that have generated only slightly differentiatied copies of CRF-domain loci. Interestingly,
within sequenced genomes there are no known examples
of CRF genes having arisen from tandem duplications,
but this may change with the increasing number of plant
genomes being sequences. The possibility of some subfunctionalization or specialization of any of these CRF
subclades will be an interesting area of future research.
Cytokinin regulation of previously unexamined CRFs

We attempted to make use of the phylogeny of so many
newly identified CRF genes to further our understanding
of potential CRF gene function. We examined four, previously unexamined CRF genes from Tomato that we predicted, based on their phylogenetic placement, to possess
possible cytokinin regulation.
Specific primers were generated for each gene such that
RT-PCR could be performed on cDNA made from RNA
transcripts from Tomato leaves with and without a cytokinin treatment. For simplicity we have further designated each of the four Tomato unigene constructs
representing these genes as Solanum lycopersicum or
SlCRFs (SlCRF1 also previously designated as PTI6 is
from SGN-U579886, SlCRF3 is from SGN-U573201,
SlCRF4 is from SGN-U574151, and SlCRF5 is from SGNU583231). We were able to detect transcript from each of
the four SlCRFs in a range of tissues (data not shown), but
decided to focus on cytokinin expression in leaves. Transcript levels for all four SlCRFs were found to be induced
in Tomato leaves treated for 2 hours with 5 Î¼M cytokinin
(benzyladenine) vs. a carrier control DMSO (Figure 3).
This induction is similar to some of the previously examined Arabidopsis CRFs and suggests that each of these
SlCRF genes is regulated by cytokinin [10]. Not only is
this a novel function not previously ascribed to any of
these genes, but it is the first ascribed gene function for
SlCRF3, 4, and 5. This highlights the potential power of a
broad phylogenetic framework for determining function
of previously unknown genes.

Discussion
In this study we define a subset of AP2/ERF proteins
known as CRF or Cytokinin Response Factor proteins
after the six members of this group from Arabidopsis
(CRF1-6). CRF proteins can be characterized by the presence of two domains, a specific variant of AP2/ERF DNA
binding domain near the middle of the protein and a
novel domain at the N-terminal end that is unique to CRF
genes. Additionally, in many CRF proteins there is also a
putative kinase phosphorylation motif in the C-terminal
half of the sequence.
The novel CRF domain is present in all CRF proteins,
always found in the N-terminal region and always paired
with a distinct AP2 DNA binding domain sequence. Identification of CRF proteins can be made using either of the
AP2 or CRF domain alone. Previous phylogenetic studies
of ERF proteins examining just the AP2 domain do return
a cluster of proteins that possess the CRF domain. Interestingly, while AP2 domains are found in a wide range of
plants and even some bacteria without a CRF domain, the
CRF domain is never found in any protein without an
AP2 domain [3,6]. Proteins that contain the CRF domain
make up about 10% of Arabidopsis ERF proteins (12/122),
6.5% of rice ERF proteins (9/137), and 6.5% of Populus
(11/168) [2,5,8]. Additional estimates of the CRF domain

abundance in other plant species are difficult to make
without a large scale study of ERF proteins or a
sequenced genome, but numbers appear to reside in a
similar range of 5-10% of ERF proteins.
The CRF proteins appear to be unique to land plants.
Despite the availability of several fully sequenced green
algal genomes, CRF domain containing genes could not
be identified in this lineage. In searching for such, we
assumed that moss and bryophyte CRF domain
sequences would make the best BLAST queries, although
even those may have not been similar enough to any algal
CRF domains to get a hit. AP2 domain containing genes
are present in green algal genomes but examination of
several of these [15] did not reveal any ERF type genes in
these organisms.
Flowering plant CRF proteins roughly fall into two large
clades, A and B, according to distance and parsimony
analyses (Figure 2). That diverse species of flowering
plants i.e. both monocots and eudicots, occur in each of
these clades suggests a relatively early divergence of the
two CRF lineages.
Clade A contains approximately twice as many CRF
genes for numerous plant species as the B clade. Previous
examinations of then unknown CRF proteins from larger
scale analyses of the entire ERF protein family, have
hinted at such a discrepancy for some species but lacked
resolution of clade A and B members [2,5,8]. Our analysis
of a wide range of species strongly suggests that B clade
CRFs, while slightly divergent from A clade members,
clearly belong to the CRF group and not any other ERF
sub-group.
An additional motif found in a number of CRF proteins
is the amino acid sequence SP [T/V]SVL in the C-terminal end of the protein downstream of the AP2 domain.
Although this motif is found in all of the previously
described Arabidopsis CRF genes, similar genes from rice
(subgroup VI), and both Tomato Pti6 and Tsi1 it is not
ubiquitous among CRF proteins occurring in roughly half
of the CRFs identified here for which full length sequence
is available [8,12,13]. Additionally, in contrast to the CRF
domain, a SP [T/V]SVL motif is known to occur in a
number of proteins outside of the AP2/ERF family,
including Phosphatididylinositol transferases, Universal
stress proteins, LRR/extensions, and Myb and Zinc Finger transcription factors. There are 33 non-CRF proteins
that fall into this category in Arabidopsis alone. Interestingly, several of the members of this group have also been
shown to have effects on leaf development like the CRF
genes, including Early Phytochrome Responsive1 (EPR1),
Longifolia (LNG1 and LNG2) and Growth Regulating
Factor3 (GRF3) (Additional File 2). While the effects of
leaf development vary among this group it is revealing
that nearly 30% of Arabidopsis proteins with this motif
can be linked to leaf development. Perhaps more signifi-

cant is the apparent link between this motif and regulation by the hormone cytokinin, as nearly half of the nonCRF genes (14 of 30) that contain this motif and have
been examined on Affymetrix microarray experiments,
show altered transcription levels by treatment with cytokinin or in cytokinin mutants (Additional File 2). It is possible that the SP [T/V]SVL motif functions as a putative
MAP kinase and/or casein kinase 1 phosphorylation site,
as part of this motif has previously been described as
such [8,9]. Such a function may serve to link CRFs to
cytokinin regulation as phosphorylation is an essential
part of other members of the cytokinin signaling pathway
[16].
It is currently unclear as to the exact function of CRF
proteins. Only eight have been experimentally examined
prior to this report: CRF1-6 from Arabidopsis, PTI6 from
Tomato, and TSI1 from Tobacco. While all CRFs possess
an AP2/ERF binding domain and are most closely related
to Ethylene Response Factor (ERF) proteins directly
involved in ethylene response, there is no evidence that
CRFs are linked to ethylene save the putative ability of
their AP2 domain to bind to the ethylene response element, GCCGCC. None of the Arabidopsis CRF genes
show any transcriptional change in response to ethylene
or in ethylene mutant backgrounds in microarray experiments. Additionally, CRF1-6 mutants bear little resemblance to classic ethylene mutant phenotypes and show
no sign of variation in ethylene levels, even in analysis of
triple mutant knockout lines [[17], Rashotte and Kieber,
unpublished result].
One potential role of CRF genes could be in cytokinin
regulation as all six Arabidopsis CRF proteins examined
have been shown to be regulated by cytokinin in terms of
their intracellular, particulary nuclear localization - presumably the site of action for these transcription factors
[10]. However, only three of these six CRF genes, CRF2,
CRF5, and CRF6 are regulated by cytokinin transcriptionally and the other three do not show any transcriptional regulation by cytokinin as examined in microarray
experiments [10,18,19]. Future study at the protein level
has yet to determine if the other Arabidopsis CRF proteins are similarly cytokinin regulated, and none of the
newly discovered CRF proteins identified in other plant
species here have been examined in this manner to date.
Only one study prior to this one has examined cytokinin regulation at the transcriptional level outside of Arabidopsis, Hirose et al., 2007 [20]. This study in rice used
microarrays to examine global expression patterns of
genes regulated by cytokinin application and in a cytokinin response regulator overexpressing plant. While this
work did identify several highly related ERF family genes
that are induced by cytokinin similar to the CRFs, and
supports the general role of ERFs in cytokinin regulated
processes, the induced ERF genes in rice do not contain

Page 7 of 10

either a CRF domain or a SP(T/V)SVL motif in their protein sequences [20]. The cytokinin induced ERF genes are
related to CRFs, but lack CRF domains and have been
placed by sequence analyses into different subgroups
after careful examination (group B-3 or VII vs. group B-5
or VI [2,8,20]). Further examination of the other members of this group and of just the CRF domain alone are
needed to determine if this domain is specifically
involved in cytokinin regulation of these proteins.
Despite the current lack of evidence it is an attractive
hypothesis that the CRF domain is somehow involved in
cytokinin regulation.
Mutational analysis of CRF genes is likewise limited to
studies in Arabidopsis although a RNAi knockout of Tsi1
was generated in tobacco [10,21]. The study of mutants in
CRF1 to CRF6 genes has indicated a possible role in cotyledon, leaf, and embryo development in addition to their
link to cytokinin [10]. There are no specific reports of
additional phenotype alterations in any of the other Arabidopsis genes containing a CRF domain or in any other
species to date, although this is may be due to either a
lack of mutants, lack of study, or potentially redundant
nature of CRF genes as seen in Arabidopsis.
In order to further examine if cytokinin does play role
in the regulation of newly 'discovered' CRF proteins outside of Arabidopsis we examined four CRF genes identified in this study from Tomato. We chose these Tomato
genes as it allowed for the examination of both a known
CRF protein, PTI6 that we also designate SlCRF1, and
three novel proteins, SlCRF3-5, none of which had previously been examined for cytokinin or any other response.
An analysis of SlCRF transcripts in Tomato leaves in the
presence and absence of cytokinin treatment shows that
all four SlCRFs are induced by cytokinin to varying
degrees (Figure 3). This significant result shows that
SlCRFs are truly regulated by cytokinin, at least at the
transcriptional level, and suggests that CRF proteins may
generally play a role in cytokinin regulation. It is interesting that all the SlCRFs show transcriptional cytokinin
regulation, when not all Arabidopsis CRFs are known to
be transcriptionally regulated, especially since all CRF
domain containing genes in rice appear to not show this
regulation as seen in one microarray examination [10,20].
Additional putative functions for CRF proteins including links to pathogen response and salt stress come from
the two other CRF proteins that have been previously
examined in some detail for function, Pti6 from Tomato
and Tsi1 from Tobacco [12,13]. Pti proteins Pti4/5/6 are
known to interact with Pto Kinase that is directly linked
to pathogen response, as this is how they were originally
identified [12]. All three of these Pti proteins are also ERF
proteins, yet only Pti6 can be classified as a CRF protein.
While it is unclear how these Pti proteins act with Pto
kinase in pathogen response, it appears that the CRF

Rashotte and Goertzen BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:74
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/74

domain is not essential of that interaction. Not only do
both Pti4 and 5 lack that domain, but an examination of
the yeast-two hybrid analyses to determine what parts of
the Pti proteins are required to interact with the Pto
kinase showed that the initial 48 amino acids of Pti6, containing at least half of its CRF domain, was not necessary
[12]. Tsi1 has been linked by transcript induction to high
salt stress and bacterial pathogen resistance in 35S overexpressing Tsi1 transgenic plants and to similar stresses
in Tsi1:RNAi plants [13,21]. Interestingly, Park et al., 2001
also found that the AP2 domain of Tsi1 was able to bind
both the GCC box involved in ethylene response and also
the CBF/DREB cis-element involved in drought stress
response. This would suggest the involvement of the AP2
domain in the salt stress response of Tsi1. Together these
analyses of Pti6 and Tsi1 clearly indicate a role of these
proteins in pathogen response. This suggests that pathogen response may be a larger function for the CRF group
of proteins, although there is little evidence to suggest
any CRF proteins other than Pti6 and Tsi1 are involved in
pathogen responses as evidenced from the lack of
response in several pathogen response microarray analyses of Arabidopsis CRF genes. Response to salt stress
could also a part of CRF protein function as Tsi1 has been
shown to function in that area and there is some microarray data that a few Arabidopsis CRF genes could be
involved, but little is known beyond that. A more detailed
analysis of pathogen and salt stress responses will have to
be made before any clear function can be ascribed to this
group of proteins or genes, but as members the members
of this group are now defined it should be easier to compare and compile these and other potential functions in
the future.

Conclusions
We have defined a distinct subgroup of AP2/ERF proteins
comprised of over 125 members from a wide range of
land plants that we designate as CRF proteins. These proteins can be specifically characterized by a conserved,
novel domain unique to this group, designated as the CRF
domain, which is always found in a N-terminal position
to an additionally CRF-specific AP2 DNA binding
domain. Many CRF proteins also contain a putative phosphorylation motif in their C-terminal end. Distance and
parsimony analyses of the CRF and AP2 domain
sequences of these proteins suggest that there are two
major lineages of flowering plant CRFs, here designated
clade A and B. Additional support for the distinction of
these two clades is provided by the presence of the TEH
region, an N-terminal extension of the CRF domain that
is found only in clade A proteins. There are roughly twice
as many CRF clade A sequences as clade B available in
databases and the same 2:1 ratio is seen in several fully
sequenced genomes.

Only limited functional analyses have been performed
on the eight previously known CRF proteins, those suggesting potential roles in cytokinin regulation, pathogen
response or salt stress. An examination of four newly
identified CRFs from Tomato (SlCRFs) revealed that they
are also induced by cytokinin, further supporting the idea
that CRF proteins may function in general in cytokinin
regulation. Additional work on more CRF proteins is
needed to determine the overarching function of this
group.

Methods
Database searches

Putative CRF genes were identified in sequence databases
with BLAST searches using blastx, tblastn and tblastx.
Additionally, iterated profile searches were conducted
using PSI-BLAST (Position-Specific Iterated BLAST).
CRF, TEH, and AP2 domains from diverse CRF genes (as
they were discovered), and variously broad consensus
sequences of each of these domains were used as query
sequences in multiple searches. All sequence databases
were also queried using HMMER3 software that employs
hidden Markov probabilistic models capable of detecting
remote homologs [22]. Default settings of the various
BLAST programs were used except for the low complexity
filter and compositional adjustments. In searches for
divergent homologues, the statistical significance threshold for reporting matches was raised, word size decreased
to 2, and matrix and gap costs varied. NCBI NR/NT, EST,
GSS, HTGS and WGS databases as well as trace archives
and several (not yet NCBI accessioned) ongoing sequencing project databases were searched for CRF domain proteins. To identify putative CRF genes belonging to the
earliest branching lineages of land plants, BLAST searches
were performed in an iterative fashion i.e. successively
'deeper' hits representing earlier branching lineages were
used as queries in five additional round of searches.
Sequence analyses

Motif detection was performed with MEME (MEME version 4.1.0, http://meme.sdsc.edu/meme/) [23].
All CRF domain containing proteins were aligned across
their TEH, CRF, AP2 domains and 3' regions where possible. Amino acid alignments were performed in ClustalX
2.0 using all default options with manual adjustments
where necessary. Only CRF and AP2 domain regions were
included in phylogenetic analyses, and the final alignment
of 136 sequences contained 85 characters, alignment available from the authors upon request.
Phylogenetic analyses were performed in PAUP*
v.4.0b11 [24] using both the Neighbor Joining method and
also Maximum Parsimony (MP) as an optimality criterion
for tree evaluation. The heuristic search strategy involved
thousands of random sequence addition replicates with

tree bisection-reconnection (TBR) branch swapping. To
assess support for each node, bootstrap analyses [25] were
performed using 1000 pseuodreplicates and 10 random
addition replicates with TBR branch swapping within each
bootstrap replicate. Specific Genebank accessions reference for species labels in Figure 2 are shown in Additional
File 1.
Examination of SlCRF gene transcripts

Tomato seedlings (Solanum lycopersicum v. moneymaker)
were germinated in Sunshine Mix #8, initially grown for 10
days in a growth chamber at 16 h light at 22C and 8 h dark
at 18C and then transferred to a greenhouse maintained at
24C. To examine cytokinin regulation, leaves from a 20
day old plant were excised and placed in water and gently
shaken for 1 hour at which point either 5 Î¼M cytokinin
(benzyladenine) or the carrier solvent DMSO was added
with shaking allowed to continue (after Rashotte et al.,
2003[19]). After a 2 hour treatment leaves were patted dry
and RNA was extracted by flash freezing and grinding tissue in liquid nitrogen prior to extraction using a Qiagen
RNeasy kit. RT-PCR (25 cycles) was performed using this
tissue-derived RNA via a Qiagen One Step RT-PCR kit
with gene specific primers for each SlCRF and beta-tubulin. This was repeated on three biological samples, with a
representative outcome shown in Figure 3. Primers are as
follows. SlCRF1 (SGN-U579886, PTI6) forward 5'
