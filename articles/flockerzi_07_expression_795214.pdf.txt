Abstract
Background: The human genome comprises numerous human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs)
that formed millions of years ago in ancestral species. A number of loci of the HERV-K(HML-2)
family are evolutionarily much younger. A recent study suggested an infectious HERV-K(HML-2)
variant in humans and other primates. Isolating such a variant from human individuals would be a
significant finding for human biology.
Results: When investigating expression patterns of specific HML-2 proviruses we encountered
HERV-K(HML-2) cDNA sequences without proviral homologues in the human genome, named
HERV-KX, that could very well support recently suggested infectious HML-2 variants. However,
detailed sequence analysis, using the software RECCO, suggested that HERV-KX sequences were
produced by recombination, possibly arising ex vivo, between transcripts from different HML-2
proviral loci.
Conclusion: As RT-PCR probably will be instrumental for isolating an infectious HERV-K(HML2) variant, generation of "new" HERV-K(HML-2) sequences by ex vivo recombination seems
inevitable. Further complicated by an unknown amount of allelic sequence variation in HERVK(HML-2) proviruses, newly identified HERV-K(HML-2) variants should be interpreted very
cautiously.

Background
About 8% of the human genome is composed of
sequences with retroviral origin. Among those, human
endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are remnants of ancient
exogenous retroviruses that infected germ line genomes
followed by fixation of proviruses in the population millions of years ago. It appears that most HERV families
formed in ancestral species during relatively short time
periods, and creation of new proviruses then ceased.
Therefore, most HERV families' proviruses accumulated
numerous nonsense mutations that rendered them defective both regarding coding capacity for retroviral proteins
and transcriptional activity [1-3]. The so-called HERVK(HML-2) family, in short, HML-2, is exceptional in several aspects. HML-2 is transcribed in a variety of human
tissues [4]. In germ cell tumors HML-2 expression is
highly upregulated [5]. Several HML-2 proviruses in the
human genome encode functional Gag, Pro, Pol and/or
Env proteins, or even appear fully intact [6-8]. Furthermore, an additional protein from an HML-2 splice product, Rec, may be involved in germ cell tumorigenesis [9].
Several HML-2 loci are evolutionarily old. Those so-called
HERV-K(OLD) loci typically harbor a 96 bp insertion
within the gag gene [10]. In contrast, a number of HML-2
loci appear evolutionarily much younger. They are present
in the human genome but not in the chimpanzee or other
apes' genomes, so that they very likely formed after the
evolutionary split of human from chimpanzee
[6,8,11,12]. Such young HML-2 loci either exist as proviruses or as solitary LTRs, the latter being the result of
homologous recombination between the LTR's of a provirus, leaving one LTR behind.
The source of evolutionarily young and reasonably intact
HML-2 sequences is hitherto unknown. Based on HML-2
sequence analysis, Belshaw et al. suggested an infectious
pool of endogenous HML-2 proviruses that has persisted
within the primate lineage throughout the past 30 million
years. HML-2 sequences from that infectious pool sporadically reinfected and formed new proviruses in the human
germ line, where some proviruses became fixed in the
population. However, an infectious HML-2 variant has
not been isolated so far, and it is unclear whether infectious HML-2 variants exist in humans to this day [13,14].
If it still existed, the exact nature of that variant, in terms
of its actual sequence, remains unspecified. We report
here analysis of mysterious HML-2-like sequences, named
HERV-KX, that we isolated in the course of an HML-2
expression study. Employing the recently developed software RECCO [15], we revealed that HERV-KX sequences
very likely are ex vivo recombination products between
transcripts from different HML-2 proviruses.

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/4/1/39

Generation of recombinants in the course of reverse transcription of RNA and subsequent PCR is a well known
phenomenon. Retroviral reverse transcriptase (RT) is
known to switch templates both in vivo and ex vivo [1620]. While template switches of retroviral RT's are critical
for retrovirus biology, RT template switches occuring ex
vivo and thus producing sequence artifacts in molecular
biology experiments have been described [21-24]. PCR is
also prone to generate chimeric products [25,26].
Our results underline that the pursuit for a replicating
HML-2 variant requires caution as to the interpretation of
newly identified HML-2 sequences. Such caution is not
only required when studying transcribed HML-2
sequences, but also when studying transcripts from other
HERV families and other repetitive sequences in general.
Furthermore, since detection of recombination events in
candidate sequences can be computationally difficult, and
since other software tools in our hands failed to produce
similar results for our dataset, RECCO is a valuable software tool for examining such new sequences.

Results
Nature of HERV-KX sequences
In the course of an HERV-K(HML-2) expression study, we
analysed, in total, 642 HML-2 cDNA sequences that were
derived from various human tissues. About 95% of cDNA
sequences could be unambiguously assigned to individual HML-2 proviral loci. Details for that part of the analysis will be reported elsewhere (Flockerzi et al., manuscript
in preparation). In contrast, about 5% of cDNA sequences
could not be definitely assigned to particular HML-2 loci
in the human genome sequence. Their sequences were
either similar to evolutionarily older HERV-K(OLD) proviruses, or to "modern" HERV-K(HML-2) proviruses, in
that they displayed or lacked, respectively, a 96 bp
sequence within the gag gene region [10]. We defined
cDNA sequences as HERV-KX when they displayed in initial analysis 18 or more nt differences to the most similar
HML-2 proviral locus. That number was based on
observed nt differences of assignable cDNA sequences and
should be taken as somewhat arbitrary due to the lack of
defined criteria for HERV-KX sequences (see below).
HERV-KX cDNA sequences displayed on average 37.5 (SD
16.2) nt differences from their most similar HML-2 locus.
The most divergent HERV-KX sequence in our analysis
displayed 62 (9%) nt differences to its best match. Compared with each other, HERV-KX sequences were heterogeneous in sequence as well (Figure 1). We did not
identify an HERV-KX sequence twice. Thus, HERV-KX
sequences comprised a diverse group of HML-2 (-like)
sequences.

human genome. The majority of cDNAs displayed between zero and a few differences to the best match, and were thus assignable to specific HML-2 loci. A minority of cDNAs displayed a greater number of dissimilarities to the best match and were thus
not assignable with confidence to specific HML-2 loci. HERV-KX sequences were defined as displaying 18 or more nucleotide
differences to the best matching HML-2 locus. (B) Sequence divergence of HERV-KX sequences in comparison to selected
HML-2 reference sequences from the human genome, depicted as a neighbour joining-tree of the absolute number of nucleotide differences between sequences. For the sake of clarity, phylogenetically more distant HML-2 reference sequences were
not included in the tree, as they were less similar to HERV-KX sequences than the reference sequences included in the tree.
Proviral reference sequences are given as "xx_xxx" (see text). Positions with gaps were excluded in pairwise sequence comparisons.

Test sequences were created in silico by combining sequence regions of assignable HML-2 cDNA sequences, with the aim to construct recombination events between
transcripts from corresponding HML-2 loci. Pairwise comparisons, using the in-house Bio-Python script Locus-Assigner, were then performed for test and reference
sequences. Column 1 denotes the cDNA sequence name. Column 2: best matching HML-2 proviral locus according to pairwise sequence comparisons with Locus-Assigner.
The numbers given here disregard the PCR primer binding regions, and therefore are, for HERV-KX sequences B262, B12 and 93, below the <18 nt differences-threshold
initially set for HERV-KX (see text). Due to the lack of a HERV taxonomy, and for the sake of simplicity, HML-2 proviral loci have been numbered artificially in this paper, with
the first number indicating chromosomal location of the locus, and the second number being a consecutive number without further connotation. Column 3: nucleotide
differences to best match. Column 4: number of recombinations according to RECCO. Column 5: proviral loci involved in recombination(s). More than one locus is given
when different loci displayed identical (dis)similarities. Column 6: regions where recombination(s) occured, with the 5' end of the RT-PCR product being defined as nucleotide
+1. Column 7: nucleotide differences to individual HML-2 loci. Column 8: p-values of particular predicted recombinations. Column 9: nucleotide differences remaining after
considering recombination(s) (see text).

RECCO analysis of test sequences
To characterize the nature of HERV-KX sequences, we
investigated whether HERV-KX sequences showed signs of
recombination events. Using the approach described in
Materials and Methods, and in the Additional information [see Additional file 1], we first evaluated the power
and sensitivity of the recombination detecting software
RECCO [15] in our specific sequence context. For this purpose, we analysed HML-2 test sequences that were combined in silico from assignable cDNA sequences from
different HML-2 proviruses, and thus generated one or
two recombination events in a background of imperfect
cDNA-provirus matches. For all those sequences RECCO
was able to identify recombination events as well as
regions where recombinations had "taken place" (Table
1). We then analysed assignable HML-2 cDNA sequences
that very likely had not undergone recombination events.
For all of those sequences, RECCO did not suggest recombination events (data not shown). Thus, RECCO detects
recombination events in HML-2 sequences with high sensitivity, yet, does not falsely predict recombinations.
Comparison of RECCO with other recombination
detection software
We also tested other recombination detection software,
e.g. RDP2 [27] and TOPALi [28]. We analyzed the artificial
recombinant
sequences
"B86_B107"
and
"B112_B131" that showed particularly strong recombination signals in RECCO analysis (Table 1). TOPALi apparently did not correctly score gaps; it detected the 96 bp
insertion between nucleotide 68 and 163 as a recombina-

tion for both sequences. Interestingly, TOPALi identified
the true recombination breakpoint when we removed
most sequences from the alignment that are not involved
in the recombination and collapsed gap regions as much
as possible. RDP2 could roughly identify the breakpoint
location in the full alignment, but did not assign parental
sequences correctly (data not shown). In summary, the
size of the dataset and the number of gap regions made
the analysis very difficult for current recombination detection programs.
RECCO analysis of HERV-KX sequences
Using RECCO, we analysed HERV-KX sequences in comparison to respective HML-2 proviral sequences in the
human genome. All HERV-KX sequences were predicted
by RECCO to consist of two to three different HML-2 proviral sequences, thus having undergone one or two,
respectively, recombination events. For two sequences,
alternative predictions, further reducing the number of
nucleotide differences, involved four different proviruses,
thus involving three recombination events (Table 2).
Recombinations within three exemplary cDNA sequences
can be portrayed as follows. HERV-KX sequence "B270",
displaying 39 nt differences to its best match, was predicted to be comprised of sequences from a provirus on
chromosome 7 and two different proviruses on chromosome 3. Recombinations were predicted to have occured
between nt 267 and 273 and between nt 583 to 712 of the
cDNA, resulting in an explanation with zero nt differences. HERV-KX sequence "94", displaying 26 nt differences to its best matching provirus on human

RECCO-based explanation of HERV-KX sequences as recombination products
RECCO-based explanation of HERV-KX sequences as recombination products. Based on RECCO analysis, HERVKX sequences can be explained as recombination products between transcripts from different HML-2 proviral loci. Three
examples of HERV-KX sequences were multiply aligned with HML-2 proviral sequences, the transcripts of which served as
template for recombination events. HERV-KX sequence "93" was generated by one recombination event involving two loci.
HERV-KX sequence "B270" was generated by two recombination events involving three loci. HERV-KX sequence "94" was
generated by two recombination events involving two different proviral templates. Probable recombination regions are indicated by medium grey background. Light and dark grey background indicates proviral templates. Localization of the RT-PCR
amplicon and the 96 bp sequence (see text) within the HML-2 gag gene/provirus is depicted above the sequence comparisons.

occured between nt 415 and 422, and between nt 583 and
651, resulting in an explanation with zero nt differences.
Finally, HERV-KX sequence "93", displaying 13 nt differences to its best match, was predicted to be comprised of
proviruses on human chromosome 7 and 21, with a
recombination between nt 583–610, and resulting in an
explanation with 1 nt difference remaining (Figures 2 and
3). For all HERV- KX sequences, on average 35 (SD 15.5)
nt differences could be reduced to 2.6 (SD 3.4) nt differences when considering RECCO predictions for recombinations. Those numbers are in ranges typically observed
in our analysis for best matches of assignable sequences,
where, on average, 4.5 (SD 3.7) nt differences remained
between cDNA and best match. Of further note, because
we defined HERV-KX sequences as displaying 18 or more

nt differences to the best match, it is possible that there are
further recombined cDNAs with corresponding signals
among the sequences with <18 nt differences.
Taken together, RECCO analysis indicates that HERV-KX
sequences are due to recombination events and that
HERV-KX sequences are not represented in the human
genome assembly because of that.

Discussion
The nature of HML-2 sequences having formed evolutionarily young HML-2 proviruses in the human genome
remains speculative. Based on HML-2 sequence analysis,
Belshaw et al. put forward a replication-competent, infectious variant that occasionally (re-)infects humans and
thus forms new proviruses, some of which became fixed
in the population [13]. However, the sequence of such a
variant and its current host(s) remains unknown. As

Retrovirology 2007, 4:39

reported just recently, engineered HML-2 consensus
sequences, named Phoenix and HERV-K_CON, are infectious and form new proviruses. However, as long as a naturally occuring infectious variant has not been identified,
it is not clear how similar in sequence Phoenix or HERVK_CON would be to that variant [29,30]. Eventually, it
will be essential to demonstrate by molecular genetic
means the naturally occurring variant.
In the course of an investigation of expression patterns of
HERV-K(HML-2) proviruses in various human tissues, we
encountered among all sequenced cDNA's about 5% of
so-called HERV-KX cDNA sequences displaying high similarities to HML-2, yet, without definite proviral homologues in the human genome. In comparison to each
other, HERV-KX sequences were heterogeneous.
In principle, HERV-KX sequences might corroborate the
hypothesis of a replication-competent HML-2 variant.
HERV-KX sequences were not isolated from every individual and might represent rare allelic variants or newly
formed proviruses in the investigated tissue specimen.
And, HERV-KX sequence heterogeneity might imply a
quasispecies-like nature of infectious HML-2 variants.
Some HML-2 loci indeed exist as allelic variants, consisting of tandem proviruses or full-length versus solitary
LTRs, or being present at, or absent from a genomic locus
[31-34]. However, it is very unlikely that as many HML-2
proviruses as represented by HERV-KX sequences went
unnoticed so far. Alternatively, HERV-KX sequences could
also stem from a new, recombined, transcriptionally
active provirus that had formed after reverse transcription
(including template switches in vivo) of HML-2 RNAs
within an HML-2-encoded retroviral particle. If so, one
would expect to repeatedly isolate a new, defined cDNA
sequence from that provirus, just as we repeatedly isolated
transcripts from known HML-2 proviruses. However,
HERV-KX sequences were heterogeneous among each
other and we did not identify a new cDNA population
from a new HML-2 provirus (see Fig. 1A). Also, we isolated HERV-KX sequences from RNA from brain, that does
not express detectable amounts of HML-2 Gag protein,
and thus retroviral particles (M. Sauter, unpublished
results).
Of greater significance, closer inspection of HERV-KX
sequences with the recombination-detecting software
RECCO strongly indicates that HERV-KX sequences are
mosaics between different HML-2 proviruses and therefore can be interpreted as recombinants between different
transcribed proviruses and with varying recombination
breakpoints--thus explaining HERV-KX sequence heterogeneity. Even though it is possible to argue for a few
HERV-KX sequences about weak recombination signals
that only save a few differences between cDNA and provi-

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/4/1/39

ral sequences, nearly all analyzed HERV-KX sequences
show a clear signal for at least a single recombination
event.
Our study does not formally exclude recombinations
between HML-2 sequences occuring in vivo. However,
because of above described findings, we conclude that isolated HERV-KX sequences are very unlikely to stem from
allelic polymorphisms of HML-2 loci, or from new,
recombined proviruses that formed in the investigated tissue sample. Recombinations are very likely due to ex vivo
recombination.
There are two opportunities for ex vivo recombination in
the course of the experiment. First, during cDNA generation, reverse transcriptase could have switched from an
RNA template from one HML-2 provirus to an RNA template from another HML-2 provirus, forming a chimera
between two different HML-2 proviruses. Second, during
PCR, incompletely polymerised DNA single-strands could
have reannealed with an incomplete DNA single-strand
from another HML-2 provirus and were then polymerised
until the end, likewise forming a chimera. Both mechanisms of ex vivo recombination have been studied in detail
recently, and are known to produce chimeric sequences
[16-21,25,26]. HERV-KX sequences could have been produced either by one, or by a combination of both mechanisms. In this context, we were able to produce 10.5% of
recombinant gag sequences in a separate ex vivo experiment by in vitro transcribing different HML-2 gag
sequences, followed by RT-PCR on mixed RNA, cloning of
RT-PCR products, and screening for recombinants utilizing restriction enzymes sites present in one or the other
gag sequence [see Additional file 1].
Our findings are significant for the identification of an
infectious HML-2 variant. Generation of ex vivo recombination products in analogous experimental studies seems
almost inevitable.
Results from such studies should therefore be interpreted
very cautiously concerning isolation of new HML-2 (-like)
sequences. That is, it will be difficult to nambiguously
demonstrate an infectious HML-2 variant just by RT-PCR.
In addition, after taking recombination into account,
remaining nucleotide differences between experimental
and reference sequences, as observed for a few HERV-KX
sequences, are no strong arguments for having isolated an
infectious HML-2 variant. First, RT, PCR and sequencing
errors must be considered. Second, recent work from our
group demonstrated for the HERV-K(HML-2.HOM) provirus several haplotypes on the single nucleotide level that
severely affected coding capacity of proviral gag, pro and
pol genes [33]. Similar findings were reported for HML-2
env sequences [35]. It seems reasonable to assume that

Page 9 of 12

Retrovirology 2007, 4:39

other HML-2 proviruses likewise comprise numerous alleles on the DNA sequence level, thus contributing to the
observed remaining nucleotide differences.
Taken together, since there is strong evidence that HERVKX sequences are due to ex vivo recombination events, it
seems unlikely that HERV-KX sequences are indeed portions of a replication-competent, infectious HML-2 variant.
In the light of computational difficulties of detecting
recombination events in biological sequences, our study
furthermore demonstrates that RECCO is a valuable software tool to detect or to potentially exclude such ex vivo
recombination events. This is not only true for studies on
the HML-2 family but also for other HERV families, ERVs
in other species and other classes of repetitive elements.

Conclusion
RT and PCR experiments will probably be instrumental to
examine presence of a recently proposed replicating and
infectious HERV-K(HML-2) variant in human individuals.
Both RT and PCR generate ex vivo recombination products
that may not be recognized as such, thus pretending new
HML-2 variants that falsely corroborate replicating and
infectious HML-2 variants. Using the software RECCO,
recombination products may be discerned from true
sequences with less difficulty. As for HML-2 sequences
without recombination signals, allelic variation of HML-2
loci on the nucleotide level should be taken into account
before treating them as instances of replicating and infectious HML-2 variants. Besides, our findings may be taken
as a reminder of potential pitfalls when investigating
repetitive sequences.

Methods
Generation of HML-2 cDNA sequences
Generation and analysis of HML-2 cDNA sequences is
described in more detail elsewhere (Flockerzi et al., manuscript in preparation). In brief, cDNA sequences were
amplified by RT-PCR from total RNA isolated from
human tissue specimens. PCR primers encompassed a gag
gene region of 637 bp, with respect to the previously published HERV-K(HML-2.HOM) sequence [10]. That gag
gene region also includes a 96 bp sequence that is missing
in evolutionarily young HML-2 loci but is present in evolutionarily older, so-called HERV-K(OLD) loci [10]. RTPCR products were cloned into pGEM T-Easy (Promega),
and inserts from a number of positive clones were
sequenced using vector-specific primers. Poor quality
sequence reads were not further analysed. Using the inhouse Bio-Python script Locus-Assigner, that basically
performs pairwise sequence comparisons and catalogues
numbers of differences between cDNA and reference
sequences (described in more detail in Flockerzi et al.,

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/4/1/39

manuscript in preparation), we assigned cDNA sequences
to their corresponding HML-2 provirus utilizing nucleotide differences between the various HML-2 proviruses.
HERV-KX candidate sequences, that could not be assigned
to individual HML-2 loci, were further substantiated by
sequencing both strands and generating a consensus
sequence for each.
HERV-KX sequences reported in this study were isolated
from RNA from different human specimens, such as
human brain and germ cell tumor tissue.
Characterization of HERV-KX sequences and analysis with
RECCO
We analysed HERV-KX sequences for various aspects, such
as sequence divergence from known HML-2 sequences
and between each other, length of open reading frames,
nucleotide substitution patterns, and potential recombination events. Eventually, only results from the latter
analysis proved to be meaningful, and are presented here.
We employed the software RECCO [15], version 0.92, to
examine each HERV-KX sequence for potential recombination events. As reference sequences for recombination
analysis we used corresponding gag gene regions from the
HML-2 proviruses published in the human genome reference sequence. A previously described allelic HML-2 provirus, HERV-K113 [32], that is not present in the human
genome reference sequence, was also included. A manually optimized multiple alignment of those HML-2
sequences served as reference sequence dataset for
RECCO. To derive p-values for predicted recombinations
we used the DNA mutation cost setting of RECCO and
performed 1000 permutations.

Test sequences for RECCO analysis were generated by
combining in silico sequence portions from assignable
cDNAs from different HML-2 proviruses, thus resembling
HERV-KX-like recombination products.
