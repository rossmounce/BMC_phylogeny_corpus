Abstract
Background: In circulating influenza viruses, gradually accumulated mutations on the glycoprotein hemagglutinin
(HA), which interacts with infectivity-neutralizing antibodies, lead to the escape of immune system (called antigenic
drift). The antibody recognition is highly correlated to the conformation change on the antigenic sites (epitopes),
which locate on HA surface. To quantify a changed epitope for escaping from neutralizing antibodies is the basis
for the antigenic drift and vaccine development.
Results: We have developed an epitope-based method to identify the antigenic drift of influenza A utilizing the
conformation changes on epitopes. A changed epitope, an antigenic site on HA with an accumulated
conformation change to escape from neutralizing antibody, can be considered as a “key feature” for representing
the antigenic drift. According to hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays and HA/antibody complex structures, we
statistically measured the conformation change of an epitope by considering the number of critical position
mutations with high genetic diversity and antigenic scores. Experimental results show that two critical position
mutations can induce the conformation change of an epitope to escape from the antibody recognition. Among
five epitopes of HA, epitopes A and B, which are near to the receptor binding site, play a key role for neutralizing
antibodies. In addition, two changed epitopes often drive the antigenic drift and can explain the selections of 24
WHO vaccine strains.
Conclusions: Our method is able to quantify the changed epitopes on HA for predicting the antigenic variants
and providing biological insights to the vaccine updates. We believe that our method is robust and useful for
studying influenza virus evolution and vaccine development.

Background
Influenza viruses occur all over the world and cause significant morbidity and mortality [1]. The surface proteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are
the primary targets of the protective immune system. In
circulating influenza viruses, gradually accumulated
mutations on the HA, which interacts with infectivityneutralizing antibodies, lead to the escape of immune
system (called antigenic drift). The antibody recognition
of HA is highly correlated to the conformation changes
on the antigenic sites (epitopes). To quantify a changed

epitope escaping from neutralizing antibodies is the
basis to study the antigenic drift for the vaccine development [2-5].
Most of methods measuring the antigenic variances on
HA focused on amino acid position mutations, such as
hamming distance [6] or phylogenic distance [2]. An
antibody often utilized complementarily-determining
regions (CDRs) to bind two specific sites (called epitopes) on the antigen (HA) [7]. The HA consists of five
epitopes and each epitope has ~20 structural neighbour
amino acids locating on the protein surface [8].
Recently, few studies discussed the relationships
between the epitopes and vaccine efficiency [9].
Here, we have proposed a method to identify the antigenic drift of influenza A by quantifying the conformation

change of an epitope. Our method is able to predict antigenic variants of a given pair HA sequences which are
often a vaccine strain and a circulating strain. Our model
was evaluated to measure the antigenic drifts and vaccine
updates on 3,331 circulating strains (from year 1982 to
2009) and to predict the antigenic variants on two data
sets (i.e. 343 and 31,878 HI assays). These results demonstrate that our model is able to reflect the biological meanings and can explain the selections of WHO vaccine
strains.

Materials and methods
Figure 1 presents the overview of our method for the
antigenic drift of human influenza A (H3N2) viruses by
quantifying changed epitopes. We first identified the critical amino acid positions based on both the antigenic
variant and genetic diversity. We then measured a changed epitopes by calculating the accumulated conformation change based on amino acid mutations on an
epitope. Finally, we evaluated our model for predicting
antigenic variants and selecting the WHO vaccines.
Changed epitopes

The changed epitope is the core of our method. Here,
we defined a changed epitope as follows: an antigenic

Page 2 of 10

site (epitope) on HA with accumulated amino acid
mutations induces the conformation change to escape
from the neutralizing antibody. The conformation
change of a mutation depends on its position on HA
structure and the mutation rate during 40 years.
A changed epitope can be considered as a “key feature”
for measuring antigenic variants of a pair HA sequences.
Here, a changed epitope can be used to predict antigenic variants and antigenic drifts for the selections of
vaccine strains. The definition of five epitopes including
131 positions was proposed by Wilson et al. [8] and
Bush et al.[2].
Data sets

To describe and evaluate the ability of the changed epitopes for predicting antigenic variants, we collected
hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays, describing the
antigenic variants and similar viruses of the current
global influenza surveillance system. The HI assay
describes whether one (e.g. circulating) strain will be
recognized by an antibody against the vaccine strain.
We collected 343 H3N2 virus HI assays (Data available
at http://gemdock.life.nctu.edu.tw/influenza/File1.xls)
with 125 HA sequences from Weekly Epidemiological
Record (WER) [10], World Health Organization (WHO)

collaborating center [11] and related publications
[12-14] (Table S1 in additional file 1). Each pair includes
the HI assay value (i.e. antigenic distance) and a pair of
HA sequences (329 amino acids). In general, an influenza vaccine should be updated if an antigenic distance
is more than 4.0 between the current vaccine strain and
the circulating strain in next season [3][15]. Among 343
pairs of HA sequences, 225 pairs with antigenic distance
≥ 4 are considered as “antigenic variants” and 118 pairs
are considered as “similar viruses”. For example, the
antigenic distance of the pair HA sequences, A/England/
42/72 and A/PortChalmers/1/73, is 12 and this pair is
considered as “antigenic variants”. Conversely, the antigenic distance of the pair HA sequences, A/Wuhan/359/
95 and A/Nanchang/933/95, is 1 and this pair is considered as “similar viruses”. In addition, we prepared
another HI assay data set to independently evaluate our
model for predicting antigenic variants proposed by
Smith et al.[3]. We assume that a virus-pair in the same
antigenic group is considered as a “similar viruses” pair
and a virus-pair in different groups is considered as
“antigenic variants” pair. Finally, we yielded 31,878 HI
measurements from the supporting materials [3].
To study the antigenic drifts and WHO vaccine updates,
we collected 3,331 HA sequences (Data available at
http://gemdock.life.nctu.edu.tw/influenza/File2.xls) from
influenza virus resource [16] and influenza sequence database [17]. These sequences were assigned into 38 influenza
seasons according to their collection dates.
Identify antigenic critical positions on HA

Recently, we proposed a method to identify antigenic
critical positions [5] by utilizing both antigenic variants
and genetic diversity. The Shannon entropy and information gain (IG) were used to measure genetic diversity
and antigenic discriminating score for amino acid positions on HA, respectively. Here, we based on these rules
to select 64 amino acid positions as the critical positions
(Table S2 in additional file 1).
Models for antigenic variants based on changed epitopes

To address the issue of measuring accumulated mutations on an epitope to escape from neutralizing antibody, we proposed 4 models considering the number of
amino acid mutations on 329 amino acids and 64
selected critical positions of HA (Table 1). Models one

and two regarded an epitope as “changed” if there are
more than 1 and 2 mutations within an epitope, respectively, based on 329 amino acids. A changed epitope of
Model three is defined as two amino acid mutations on
64 critical positions. Models one, two, and three
regarded a pair HA sequences as “antigenic variants” if
there are more than two changed epitopes. Conversely,
one changed epitope is viewed as “similar viruses”.
Model four treated one changed epitope (A or B) as
“antigenic variants”. Epitopes A and B, which are near
to the receptor binding site, often play the key role for
escaping from neutralizing antibody. Here, the epitopes
A and B (denoted as “B+”) were regarded as “changed”
if there are more than 2 and 3 mutations, respectively.
For the pair A/Mississippi/1/85 and A/Leningrad/360/86
(Table 2), the numbers of mutations were 1, 3, 0, 1, and
1 on epitopes A, B, C, D and E, respectively. The numbers of changed epitopes for Models one and two are 4
(epitopes A, B, D, and E) and 1 (epitope B), respectively.
Models three and four regarded the epitope B as a changed epitope because these three mutations (i.e. positions
156, 159 and 188) were the selected critical positions.
Finally, we compared our models with two related
methods [4,8] for predicting antigenic variants. Wilson
& Cox [8] suggested that a viral variant usually contains
more than 4 residue mutations located on at least two
of the five epitopes. Lee & Chen [4] proposed a model
based on the hamming distance (HD) of 131 positions
on five epitopes to predict antigenic variants. Their
models predicted a pair of HA sequences as “antigenic
variants” if the number of mutation is more than 6.
Variant ratio for measuring the antigenic drift

We used the variant ratio (VR) to measure the vaccine
V
efficiency on year y. The VR is defined as VR(y) = Nyy ,
where Ny is total number of circulating strains in the
year y and Vy is the number of circulating strains which
are “antigenic variants” against the vaccine strain in the
year. Here, we considered an influenza vaccine should
be updated and the antigenic variants are emerging if
the VR value is ≥ 0.5.

derived from 343 HI assays, and high entropies, which
were calculated using 125 HA sequences. 64 positions
on HA were selected as critical positions (Table S2 in
additional file 1). Among these 64 critical positions, 54
positions locate on the epitopes (54/64) and 53 positions
locate on the HA surface (Fig. 1B). Additionally, 13 and
42 of these 64 critical positions were the positive selections [2] and cluster substitutions [3], respectively.
Changed epitopes for antigenic variants

Currently, several methods measured a changed epitope
to escape from neutralizing antibody [8]. Here, we utilized the degree of accumulated mutations within an
epitope to evaluate a changed epitope according to 329
positions and 64 selected positions. Figures 2 and 3
show the relationships between changed epitopes and
antigenic variants on 4 models.
Models one and two: Changed epitopes on 329 positions

Figures 2A (Model one) and 2B (Model two) show the
relationships between number of changed epitopes and
“antigenic variants” on 343 pair HA sequences with HI
assays. Among these 343 pairs for Model one, the changed epitopes of 225 “antigenic variants” pairs range
from 1 to 5 and the changed epitopes of 118 “similar
viruses” pairs range from 0 to 5. Among 34 similar
viruses with more than 4 changed epitopes for Model
one, we observed the following results: (1) the average
number of changed epitopes was 4.2; (2) the average
number of changed epitopes with only one mutation
was 2.02 and 33 pairs have more than one changed epitope with only one mutation. For example, the virus
pair, A/PortChalmers/1/73 and A/Singapore/4/75, has
four changed epitopes with one mutation (i.e. Epitopes
A, C, D, and E) (Table 2). In general, these 34 similar
viruses should be regarded as “antigenic variants”
because there are more than four changed epitopes.
This result shows that the Model one is not reasonable.
For Model two, the average number of changed epitopes was 2.2 for these 34 similar viruses. According to
the distribution (Figure 2B), Model two achieved the
highest accuract if more that two changed epitopes was
considered as “antigenic variants”. The accuracies were
74.9% (257/343) and 92.2% (29410/31878) for predicting
antigenic variants on the training set and independent
set, respectively. This result was similar to the previous
work [8].
Model three: Changed epitopes on 64 selected positions

Model three considered a changed epitope when the
number of mutations on the 64 selected critical positions is more than 2. In Model two, the numbers of
“antigenic variants” and “similar viruses” with ≥ 3

Page 5 of 10

changed epitopes were 119 and 16, respectively
(Fig. 2B). The averages of changed epitopes with ≥ 2
mutations on 329 positions for “antigenic variants” and
“similar viruses” were 3.8 and 3.2, respectively. The
averages of changed epitopes with ≥ 2 mutations on 64
selected critical positions for “antigenic variants” and
“similar viruses” were 3.2 and 1.5, respectively (Fig. 2C).
These results show that Model three using mutations
on 64 critical positions is better than Model two to discriminate “antigenic variants” from “similar viruses”. For
the “similar viruses”, A/Alaska/10/95 and A/France/75/
97, there are 12 mutations to drive zero changed epitope
because no epitope with ≥ 2 mutations on selected 64
positions (Table 2).
Three HA/antibody complex structures can be used to
provide structural evidences for the changed epitopes
[18] (Fig. S1 in additional file 1). Among these complexes, two antibodies bind to epitopes A and B (PDB
code 1KEN [19] and 2VIR [20]), while the third binds to
epitopes C and E (PDB code 1QFU [21]). The antibodies
consistently bind to two epitopes and this result agrees
to Models two and three. HA/antibody structures and
Models two and three show that two position mutations
often induce the conformational change of an epitope to
escape from the antibody recognition. However, the
numbers of changed epitopes of 48 “similar viruses”
pairs are 2 (35 pairs) and 3 (13 pair) for Model two
(Fig. 2B). Conversely, 14 “similar viruses” pairs have
more than 2 changed epitopes for Model three (Fig. 2C).
Model four

Among 72 “antigenic variants” pairs with one changed
epitope based on Model three, 70 pairs change on epitopes A or B. The single changed epitope on A or B,
which can cause “antigenic variants”, agreed to HA/antibody complex structures and the experiments. The
receptor binding site, surrounded by epitopes A and B,
is a basis for HA protein for the neutralizing mechanism
[19,22] (Fig. 1B).
Based on this observation, the epitopes A and B play a
key role for neutralizing antibodies. Model four based
on Model three considered a pair HA sequences as
“antigenic variants” when ≥ 2 changed epitopes or ≥ 1
changed epitope on A or B. In Model four, a pair HA
sequences with ≥ 3 mutations on 64 critical positions
for the epitope B is regarded as “antigenic variants”.
Thus, we annotated a virus-pairs with single changed
epitope on A or B as “1+” type (Fig. 3D). For example,
the pair, A/Guizhou/54/89 and A/Beijing/353/89, occurs
the changed epitope on A (i.e. mutation positions 135,
144 and 145) (Table 2). The accuracies of Model four
were 81.6% and 94.0% on the training set and independent set, respectively. This model outperformed two

respectively.

compared methods, i.e. Wilson & Cox (89.7%) [8] and
Lee & Chen (92.4%) [4], on the independent data set
(Fig. S2 in additional file 1).
In the HA/antibody structure complex (PDB code
1KEN [19]), the antibody binds on epitopes A and B
using two CDRs (i.e. CDR1 and CDR3) on the heavy
chain and one CDR (i.e. CDR2) on the light chain
(Fig. 4). The interface of antibody and HA consists of 13
and 5 contacted residues locating on epitopes B and A,
respectively. Among these 13 positions, 7 positions were
selected as critical positions. Based on Model four, 46
“antigenic variants” pairs have one changed epitope B
with 3 mutations on epitope B, denoted as “B+”. This
result suggested a single changed epitope B can cause
antigenic variants. For example, the pair virus strains,
A/NewYork/55/2004 and A/Anhui/1239/2005, have
three critical mutations on epitope B (i.e. positions 156,

160 and 193) (Table 2). According to the HA/antibody
structure (Fig. 4), the residue 156 interacts to CDR2
(position 55 on the antibody) and the residue 193 interacts with three residues on CDR2 (positions 50, 55 and
57) and one residue on CDR3 (position 105). This structure suggested that mutations on residues 156, 160 and
193 can induce the conformation change on epitope B
to escape from CDR2 and CDR3 of the neutralizing
antibody.
Antigenic drift and epitope evolution

We utilized the changed epitopes to study the antigenic
drift on 3,331 circulating strains ranging from 1982 to
2009 (38 influenza seasons). One of WHO surveillance
network’s purposes is to detect the emergence and
spread of antigenic variants that may signal a need to
update the composition of influenza vaccine [1,3]. Here,

we considered an emerging antigenic variant according
to WER strain, which was the dominant strain in each
influenza season [6] (Table S1 in additional file 1). For a
selected season, we applied Model four, measuring
changed epitopes for the pairs between the vaccine and
circulating strains for “antigenic variants”, and the variant ratio (VR) to detect the emerging antigenic variants.

the next season (Fig. 5A). For example, the 85-86 season, 80% of the circulating strains with changed epitope
“B+” (Fig. 5B), is the first emerging antigenic variants
and the WER strain updated in the next season (i.e.
from A/Mississippi/1/85 to A/Leningrad/360/86). In
addition, among seven “emerging antigenic variants”
seasons (matching WHO vaccine updates), four seasons
(i.e. 89-90, 91-92, 95-96 and 02-03) matched the antigenic cluster transitions proposed by Smith et al. [3].
The other three seasons, which were detected by one

changed epitope on A or B, are consistent to the WER
strain updates (i.e. 87-88, 85-86 and 99). These results
suggested that “emerging antigenic variants” with ≥ 2
changed epitopes may cause the major antigenic drift
while “emerging antigenic variants” with one changed
epitope on A or B may cause the minor antigenic drift.
To observe the epitope evolution, Figure 5B illustrates
the hamming distance (HD) on 64 critical positions of
five epitopes. For example, the VR of the season 85-86
was 0.8 (Fig. 5A) and the epitope with the largest HD
was epitope B (HD is 3.4). For 16 seasons with WER
strain updates, the average HDs of epitopes A, B, C, D
and E were 1.2, 2.1, 0.4, 0.4 and 0.5 respectively. These
results showed that epitopes A and B change more frequently in vaccine update seasons and they play a key
role for antigenic drift.

Discussion
According to the distribution of antigenic variants of
Model four (Fig. 3D), it is interesting that the major
pairs (209/225 pairs) of the antigenic variants have the
changed epitope on epitopes A or B which are closed to
the receptor binding site. Furthermore, many experiments suggested that the occlusion of the receptor binding site by antibodies bound to the HA molecule forms
the dominant neutralizing mechanism [19,22]. These
results implied that a pair of viruses often is “similar
virus” if the epitopes A and B are not changed.
Among 225 “antigenic variants” pairs, 13 pairs have no
changed epitopes (Table S3 in additional file 1). 11 pairs
of these 13 pairs have contradict antigenic types by two
antiseras, which suggested a more powerful experimental assay is required to verify the antigenic types. For
example, the antibody against the A/Alaska/10/95 strain
can’t inhibit the A/Idaho/4/95 strain; while the antibody
against the A/Idaho/4/95 strain inhibits the A/Alaska/
10/95 strain.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates our model is robust and feasible for quantifying the changed epitopes. According to
the distribution of antigenic variants in HI assays and
HA/antibody complex structures, we found that two
critical position mutations with high genetic diversity
and antigenic scores can induce the conformation
change of an epitope. Epitopes A and B, closing the
receptor binding site of HA, play a key role for neutralizing antibodies. In addition, two changed epitopes
often drive the antigenic drift and can be used to
explain the selections of 24 WHO vaccine strains.
We believe that our method is useful for the vaccine
development and studying the evolution of human
influenza A virus.
