Abstract
Background: DNA melting curve analysis using double-stranded DNA-specific dyes such as
SYTO9 produce complex and reproducible melting profiles, resulting in the detection of multiple
melting peaks from a single amplicon and allowing the discrimination of different species. We
compare the melting curves of several Naegleria and Cryptosporidium amplicons generated in vitro
with in silico DNA melting simulations using the programs POLAND and MELTSIM., then test the
utility of these programs for assay design using a genetic marker for toxin production in
cyanobacteria.
Results: The SYTO9 melting curve profiles of three species of Naegleria and two species of
Cryptosporidium were similar to POLAND and MELTSIM melting simulations, excepting some
differences in the relative peak heights and the absolute melting temperatures of these peaks.
MELTSIM and POLAND were used to screen sequences from a putative toxin gene in two different
species of cyanobacteria and identify regions exhibiting diagnostic melting profiles. For one of these
diagnostic regions the POLAND and MELTSIM melting simulations were observed to be different,
with POLAND more accurately predicting the melting curve generated in vitro. Upon further
investigation of this region with MELTSIM, inconsistencies between the melting simulation for
forward and reverse complement sequences were observed. The assay was used to accurately type
twenty seven cyanobacterial DNA extracts in vitro.
Conclusion: Whilst neither POLAND nor MELTSIM simulation programs were capable of exactly
predicting DNA dissociation in the presence of an intercalating dye, the programs were successfully
used as tools to identify regions where melting curve differences could be exploited for diagnostic
melting curve assay design. Refinements in the simulation parameters would be required to account
for the effect of the intercalating dye and salt concentrations used in real-time PCR. The agreement
between the melting curve simulations for different species of Naegleria and Cryptosporidium and the
complex melting profiles generated in vitro using SYTO9 verified that the complex melting profile
of PCR amplicons was solely the result of DNA dissociation. Other data outputs from these
simulations were also used to identify the melting domains that contributed to the observed
melting peaks for each of the different PCR amplicons.

Background
Differentiation of PCR products using DNA melting curve
analysis was first demonstrated by Ririe et al [1] with the
double-stranded DNA-specific dye SYBR Green I and has
since seen widespread adoption in real-time PCR applications [2]. Melting curve analysis provides immediate practical benefits in real-time PCR, obviating the need for gel
electrophoresis by providing a reproducible signature of
the amplified DNA sequence that may be used for typing
PCR products [1]. Typing is typically achieved by examining the first derivative of the melting curve and identifying
the characteristic "melt peak" (Tm), which is the temperature at which the rate of fluorescence change (DNA denaturation) is highest and is observed in the raw data as a
sudden decrease in fluorescence [1].
Relatively few melting curve assays are based on the melting profile of the entire PCR product, with many measuring the melting of specific probes from the region of
interest, typically targeting single nucleotide polymorphisms (eg. fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET)
probes [3]). Whole product melting curve analysis with
SYBR Green I has been used to a lesser degree in diagnostic
assays for cancer treatment monitoring [4] and pathogens
[5-9]. Almost without exception, these assays produce
simple melting curves which result in a single peak [4-9];
however, melting curve analysis need not be limited to
product differentiation on the basis of a single peak and
associated Tm. Wittwer et al [10] identified two melting
domains in a 550 bp amplicon of the hydroxytryptamine
receptor 2A gene and amplicons with multiple melting
domains have been used to differentiate species of Giardia
(660 bp amplicon from the gdh gene) [11] and Naegleria
(350 – 400 bp amplicons from the intergenic spacer
region) [12].
The idea that large double-stranded DNA fragments of
several kilobases may contain several melting domains is
not new [13], and was pursued for many years by Poland
[14] and others [13-22]. This body of work has provided
several important insights into the process of DNA melting: that it is co-operative [13,14]; that it is both sequence
and nucleotide position dependent [20]; and that it is also
subject to smaller local effects [21,22]. The possibility that
multiple melting domains existed in DNA fragments less
than a single kilobase does not appear to have been examined in these studies.
Two publicly available bioinformatic resources have been
developed to model DNA melting: POLAND [23] and
MELTSIM [24]. We evaluate the ability of these programs
to simulate melting curves for the intergenic spacer region
from three species of the waterborne protozoan Naegleria
and a segment of 18S rDNA from two species of Cryptosporidium. We also describe the use of these resources to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/107

design an informative melting curve assay for two different species of toxic cyanobacteria in silico and then physically test the assay in the laboratory to confirm assay
performance with real samples.

Results
Comparison of simulated and experimental melting curves
for protozoa
The SYTO9 melting curves of amplicons from the intergenic spacer region of N. australiensis, N. fowleri and N.
lovaniensis were very distinct as previously reported [12],
with multiple peaks differing in shape and height: the N.
australiensis amplicon melted with a single sharp peak (Fig
1G); the N. fowleri amplicon melted with three peaks all at
different heights (Fig 1A); and the N. lovaniensis amplicon
melted with two peaks, the first approximately double the
amplitude of the second (Figure 1D). When the sequence
of each Naegleria amplicon was subjected to a melting
simulation using the POLAND (Figure 1C, F, I) and
MELTSIM (Figure 1B, E, H) programs, the predicted melting curves were similar to the profiles obtained using
SYTO9. The number of melt peaks and the separation of
these peaks were consistent between the simulation programs and the physical data resulting from real-time PCR
melting curve analysis. The The predicted relative peak
heights (height of a given peak relative to the other peaks
for a given template) for N. fowleri and N. lovaniensis did
not exactly match the physical data (Figure 1A, D),
although the MELTSIM profiles (Figure 1B, E) appeared to
be a closer prediction compared to POLAND (Figure 1C,
F). The values of the Tms predicted by either program did
not match the Tms obtained by DNA melting curve analysis using SYTO9. The melting maps (Tm predicted for each
base position (or domain) versus base position) were similar for the POLAND first order reaction (Fig 1C, F) and
MELTSIM (Figure 1B, E) predictions for N. fowleri and N.
lovaniensis, but slightly different for N. australiensis, particularly in the region at around 250 bp. In the case of MELTSIM, the melting map did not cover the entire amplicon
and appeared to be truncated at 357 bp for N. fowleri and
298 bp for N. lovaniensis and N. australiensis.

A segment of 18S rDNA from Cryptosporidium parvum and
Cryptosporidium muris, approximately 300 bp, was amplified and melted in the presence of SYTO9. The differentiated melting curves resulted in complex profiles that
allowed the ready differentiation of these two species,
with C. muris producing 2 peaks with Tms of 75.5°C and
83.5°C (Figure 2D) and C. parvum producing a peak at
73.8°C and a peak with a shoulder at 80.8°C and 83.0°C
respectively (Figure 2A). The standard deviation in Tm
observed between replicates (n = 4 for each species) was
less than 0.3°C (data not shown). In the case of the C. parvum sequence there was a subtle difference between the
POLAND (Figure 2C) and MELTSIM (Figure 2B) predic-

tions, with a difference between the position and height of
the second peak and its shoulder. The MELTSIM profile
more closely matched the observed profile (Figure 2A).
The melting profiles predicted C. muris by MELTSIM (Figure 2E) and POLAND (Figure 2F) were the same as each
other and similar to the observed profile (Figure 2D) in
terms of the number of peaks and spacing between peaks.
In both cases the peak heights and absolute values Tms differed between the in vitro and in silico profiles. The melt
maps predicted by each program were similar to each
other for C. parvum (Figure 2B, 2C) and C. muris (Figure
2E, F); however, the MELTSIM maps were again truncated,
here at 238 bp.

To establish that the observed similarity in predicted and
actual meting curves was not a "dye-specific" phenomenon, N. australiensis, N. fowleri and N. lovaniensis amplicons were purified and added in equal amounts (ng) to a
solution containing PCR buffer, MgCl2 and one of four
different double-strand DNA-specific binding dyes:
SYTO9 [11], SYBR Green I [1], LC Green [10] and SYTO59
(Monis and Rasmussen unpublished). Whilst each of the
dyes was used at an optimum concentration, analysing
the melting curves under otherwise standard conditions
limited any variability that may be contributed by differing reaction conditions or PCR amplification. The comparison of melting curves for each of the Naegleria test

map for each sequence (base position versus predicted Tm) determined by MELTSIM is indicated by magenta circles. The equivalent profiles calculated by POLAND are indicated by blue plus signs or red squares for first order and second order reactions

amplicons using the four dyes (Figure 3A–D) with melting curve simulations generated by POLAND and MELTSIM showed good agreement in the number of peaks and
the peak separation for each of the dyes. The shape of the
peaks and peak height were somewhat variable when different dyes were compared, qualitatively most different in
the SYBR Green I melting curve (Figure 3B).
When comparing the melting curves for purified Naegleria
amplicons with post-purification SYTO9 addition (Figure
3A) and for Naegleria template amplified in the presence
of SYTO9 (Figure 1A) the number of peaks, peak shape
and peak separation were similar. Peak heights were also
similar with the exception of the first and second peaks in
the melting curve for the N. fowleri amplicon. The Tm of
the peaks differed only slightly.
Use of simulation software to identify diagnostic profiles
for delineation of cyanobacterial species and comparison
with experimental melting curves
To test the utility of the melting simulation programs for
the design of diagnostic melting curve assays, POLAND
and MELTSIM were used to screen the DNA sequences of

the cynD/AoaB gene, a part of the gene cluster implicated
in the production of the toxin cylindrospermopsin in the
cyanobacteria Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii [25] and Aphanizomenon ovalisporum [26], respectively. In screening the
cynD/AoaB gene sequences, a 267 bp segment that was
predicted to differentiate the two species was identified
and resulted in different melting curve simulations for
POLAND (Figure 4C, F) and MELTSIM (Figure 4B, E). The
POLAND algorithm generated two peaks for the C. raciborskii sequence (Figure 4C) and one for the A. ovalisporum
sequence (Figure 4F), whilst the MELTSIM program generated one peak with a shoulder on the right hand side for
A. ovalisporum (Figure 4E) and a single major peak with a
minor peak and extended shoulder on the right hand side
for C. raciborskii (Figure 4B). As observed with the previous simulations the melt maps generated by MELTSIM
and POLAND were similar but the MELTSIM map
appeared to stop at 238 bp.
Flanking primers were designed for the 5' and 3' ends of
this segment, where the sequences were identical between
the two different cyanobacterial species. The primers were
used to amplify template DNA from these species in the

Figure 3 of melting profiles obtained using different intercalating dyes and purified Naegleria amplicons
Comparison
Comparison of melting profiles obtained using different intercalating dyes and purified Naegleria amplicons.
First derivative plots for purified amplified DNA from Naegleria fowleri (red line), Naegleria lovaniensis (blue line) and Naegleria
australiensis (black line) melted in the presence of either SYTO9 (A), SYBR Green (B), LC Green I (C) or SYTO59 (D).

presence of SYTO9, and the resulting 267 bp amplicons
were analyzed by melting curve analysis (Figure 4A, D),
producing profiles matching the POLAND melting simulations in terms of the number and separation of melt
peaks and relative peak heights. The values of the Tms predicted by either program did not match the Tms obtained
by DNA melting curve analysis using SYTO9.
The SYTO9 melting curve assay for the cynD/AoaB gene
was used to type a set of 27 cylindrospermopsin-producing and non-toxin producing cyanobacterial DNA extracts
(Table 1). A total of 17 of the 27 extracts contained the
putative toxin gene and were rapidly genotyped into two
groups on the basis of the melting curve analysis.

Discussion
Complex melting profiles resulting in multiple melting
peaks provide a superior tool for identification of species
or characterization of amplicons compared with simple

profiles that result in only a single peak. In addition to Tm,
both the number of peaks and relative peak heights can be
used as additional diagnostic characters to facilitate identification. Until this study, a systematic method for developing such assays had not been reported. The ability to
simply submit a DNA sequence to melting simulation
software and generate a useful prediction of the likely realtime PCR melting curve profile in silico was an interesting
possibility that we firstly explored using existing SYTO9
melting curve assays that resulted in complex melt profiles. Melting curves for the intergenic spacer region from
each of the three Naegleria species had clearly distinct profiles (N. australiensis one peak; N. lovaniensis two peaks;
and N. fowleri three peaks) and in each case the number of
peaks and the separation of the peaks were predicted by
the POLAND [23] and MELTSIM [24] programs, with the
MELTSIM simulations providing a more accurate predictor of relative peak heights for the Naegleria amplicons.
Similarly, melting curves of a segment of 18S rDNA from

Comparison of real-time PCR and simulated melting profiles for different cyanobacterial species. Plots (solid

(A, B, C) and Aphanizomenon ovalisporum (D, E, F) for either DNA amplified and melted in the presence of SYTO9 (A, D) or
melting simulations conducted using the amplicon DNA sequences and either MELTSIM (B, E) or POLAND (C, F) respectively.
The melt map for each sequence (base position versus predicted Tm) determined by MELTSIM is indicated by magenta circles.
The equivalent profiles calculated by POLAND are indicated by blue plus signs or red squares for first order and second order
reactions respectively.

C. parvum and C. muris resulted in distinct profiles that
were predicted by the simulation programs, with MELTSIM providing a better prediction of the C. parvum melting
curve. In both cases the actual Tms determined using
SYTO9 melting curve analysis were generally 3 – 5°C
higher than the predicted Tms.
The difference observed between the experimental and
predicted Tms is expected considering that the thermodynamic values used in the simulations for base pair stabilities or base stacking are based on empirical data
determined for specific salt concentrations in the absence
of any intercalating dyes (eg. Blake and Delcourt [20]).
Considering the nature of the interaction between intercalating dyes and dsDNA [27] it would be expected that
intercalating dyes are likely to increase the Tm, and this is
what is observed for the experimental data compared with
the melting simulations. While it would be useful for the
simulations to more accurately predict the Tm under realtime PCR conditions (for the programs to be used as a

assay design tools), in practice this will be difficult considering that different dyes might interact with DNA differently and that the interaction might be affected by the
ratio of dye:DNA molecules.
The close agreement in the Naegleria SYTO9 melting curve
profiles and melting simulations generated using
POLAND or MELTSIM was not limited to the use of
SYTO9. Three other double-stranded DNA-specific dyes
were combined with purified Naegleria test amplicons, in
addition to SYTO9; and resulted in melting curves with
the same number of peaks and similar peak separation to
simulations generated by POLAND and MELTSIM.
Between-dye comparisons demonstrated that relative
peak height varied slightly between dyes, most obviously
for the N. fowleri melting curve, whilst the shape of the
peaks was most obviously different when SYBR Green I
was used. The melt map of the N. fowleri sequence suggests that the first 75 base-pairs of the sequence represent
the melt domain contributing to the first peak. This region

Typing of cylindrospermopsin-producing and non-producing cyanobacterial strains using a SYTO9 melting curve assay for the cynD/AoaB gene
designed in silico using the POLAND software. The Tm for each melt peak observed in cynD/AoaB positive samples is reported to one decimal place.
All cynD/AoaB negative samples are indicated by "-". Toxin production confirmed by LC-MS with a detection limit of 0.2 μg/L ([34]).

is AT-rich (73% A+T) which, considering the GC-preference of SYBR Green I [10,28], may explain the loss of this
peak for the SYBR Green I melting curve.
To test the utility of the POLAND and MELTSIM programs
for in silico melt curve assay design we chose a target gene
of more than 6 Kb, cynD/AoaB, implicated in the biosynthesis of the cyanotoxin cylindrospermopsin [25,29]. The
program interface for both melt simulation algorithms
permits submission and analysis of only one sequence at
a time. This limitation meant that sequences could only
be screened by visually identifying regions of sequence
polymorphism in a multiple alignment of the cynD/AoaB
gene homologues, then manually submitting individual
polymorphic regions to melt simulation. Screening
sequences firstly with POLAND, we identified a 267 bp
sequence segment that generated distinctly different melt
profiles depending on the origin of the sequence: two
melt peaks for cynD from C. raciborskii and one peak for
AoaB from A. ovalisporum. When these two sequences were
submitted to MELTSIM the simulation likewise predicted
one melt peak for AoaB sequence; however, only one melt
peak was predicted for cynD sequence, although the Tm
was different to the AoaB sequence and there was a sub-

peak/shoulder that was not present in the AoaB profile.
The substantial differences in the simulated melting
curves for the cynD sequence were surprising when compared to the melting simulations for the Naegleria and
Cryptosporidium amplicons, where POLAND and MELTSIM predictions were similar except for fine scale changes.
Comparison between these simulations and actual SYTO9
melting curve analysis of the cynD amplicon leaves no
doubt that the POLAND program is clearly better enabled
to model the melting in this case.
The underlying basis for the differences observed between
MELTSIM and POLAND are likely embedded in the way
the two programs implement the Poland algorithm and
incorporate the thermodynamic parameters used for base
stacking, loop opening and closing and so on. A difference
between MELTSIM and POLAND is the base pair stability
parameters that they use, with POLAND using the values
determined by Blake and Delcourt in 1998 [20], whereas
the Windows release of MELTSIM uses parameters determined by the authors of the software in 1995. Preliminary
comparisons using Linux compilations of MELTSIM [30]
incorporating either the 1995 or 1998 stability parameters
suggest that there is little difference between predictions

using either set of parameters on cynD and AoaB
sequences, with the same major peak identified and only
minor differences in other regions of the profile (data not
shown).
Examination of the melt maps generated by MELTSIM
show that the predicted melt peaks correlate with
sequence domains comprising runs of 50 or more base
pairs with the same or similar Tm, resulting in a peak with
a height proportional to the relative size of the domain. In
contrast, the POLAND melt peaks appear to correspond
with domains identified from the melt map generated
using second order reaction probabilities. This causes
POLAND to overestimate peak heights in some instances
(eg Figure 1C, 1F, 2C) but ironically also appears to be
why POLAND was able to predict two peaks for the cynD
amplicon.
Interestingly, the melt profile of C. parvum has a similar
overall shape to the predicted profile for cynD. A difference between these two sequences is that the lower Tm
domain in C. parvum is at the 3' end whereas it is at the 5'
end in cynD. Analysis of the reverse complement of cynD
(such that the melt map would be more comparable with
C. parvum) yielded a different melt profile to the original
with a much more obvious second peak half the height of
the first peak (data not shown), more similar to the
observed profile. This finding is surprising, especially considering that the melt map of the reverse complement
appeared to be similar to the original except for the orientation and for the fact that the entire reverse complemented 3' end was included in the melt map (it was
truncated in the original analysis because the MELTSIM
melt map stopped after 238 bp). This raises the possibility
that some data might be missing from the MELTSIM simulation, resulting in the loss of part of the domain and the
subsequent failure to detect the second peak. Analysis of
the reverse complementary sequences of C. parvum and N.
fowleri resulted in no change to the profiles, although the
Tm of the main C. parvum peak shifted slightly to the right
by approximately 1°C (data not shown).
The truncation of the MELTSIM melt map appears to be
caused by rounding during the calculation of domain
sizes. The maximum number of domains per block
(sequence) is 60, and it appears that MELTSIM calculates
block size by dividing the sequence length by the number
of domains per block and rounding the resulting number
down to the nearest whole number. The melt map only
allows plotting of 60 domains, which in the case of the
sequences used in this study meant that sequences were
truncated at approximately 240, 300 or 360 bp. Preliminary experiments conducted using a Linux compilation of
MELTSIM [30], modified to use the 1995 parameters and
to allow >60 domains, allowed the melt map to be cor-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/107

rected by setting the number of domains to be one less
than the sequence length (ie domain size = 1 bp), providing the melt map for the entire sequence (data not
shown). This modification did not appear to have any
effect on the predicted melting profile for cynB, suggesting
that MELTSIM does not use the melt map output directly
in the prediction of the melting curve.
The differences in the melting curves for the cynD/AoaB
amplicons, initially identified by melting curve simulation, were exploited in a diagnostic assay to type known
strains of cyanobacteria that produce the cyanotoxin
cylindrospermopsin. Actual amplification of the expected
267 bp amplicon indicated that the strain was potentially
toxic and the melting curve analysis confirmed that the
correct product had been amplified and also typed the
strain according to its genus. The Tm for each of the melt
peaks observed was very uniform and divided the strains
into two distinct groups. The melting curve analyses for C.
raciborskii and A. ovalisporum were completely concordant
with taxonomic classification. Notably, two Anabaena bergii strains were observed to bear sequences similar to the
AoaB gene on the basis of the SYTO9 melting curve analysis. Later phylogenetic investigation of these strains using
several highly conserved sequences confirmed that these
were initially misidentified and were actually A. ovalisporum (data not shown). Whilst the assay proved to be
highly informative for isolated cyanobacterial strains, it
may also be used for routine testing of environmental
samples, since cases of algal blooms that contain more
than one species of cylindrospermopsin-producing
cyanobacteria are rare (Dr. Peter Baker pers. comm.). The
possibility also remains open that single filaments of
cyanobacteria may be taken from a live environmental
sample, extracted and the DNA amplified by real-time
PCR.
Sampling extant sequence polymorphism by melting
curve analysis of whole products and using the melting
curve "signatures" for biotyping may be less discrete than
melting curve analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) (e.g. using oligonucleotides for FRET).
However, for some applications, such as species identification, the use of whole product melting curve analysis
may be preferred because it is more tolerant to any small
sequence differences that might result due to intraspecific
variation. In addition, identification using whole product
melting curve profiles is likely to be more robust than a
SNP because by its nature a SNP is relying on only a single
character difference for identification, whereas multiple
character differences are usually required to change the
melting curve profile of a larger fragment. The POLAND
or MELTSIM programs will in their present form be useful
as a guide to melt curve assay design but with some further
refinement might be adapted into dedicated melting curve

assay design software that provides access to the full richness of informative sequence polymorphism already
present in sequence databases.

Conclusion
Multiple melting domains in a melting curve provide a
rich source of information for typing samples. Computeraided melting simulation provides a gateway to the
exploitation of this information. The demonstration that
melting curve assays can be designed reliably in silico may
stimulate more widespread use of whole product melting
curve analysis and ultimately lead to dedicated melting
curve assay design software.

Methods
Microbial strains and culturing
The cyanobacteria C. raciborskii and A. ovalisporum were
cultured as described by Wilson et al [29] and the protozoa N. australiensis, N. fowleri and N. lovaniensis were prepared by aseptic transfer of a single plaque to a 1.5% nonnutrient agar plate (Oxoid, Adelaide, Australia) supplemented with 300 μL E. coli (3 × 1010 cells/ml) in sterile
saline. All subcultures were derived from the Australian
Water Quality Centre Culture collection. C. parvum
oocysts (Swiss cattle C26) were purchased from the
Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, Murdoch University, Perth, Australia. C. muris oocysts were
kindly provided by Dr Una Ryan.
DNA extraction
For cyanobacterial cultures, sub-samples of 1 ml were
taken from densely grown cultures and pelleted by centrifugation at 14000 RPM for 10 min in a Sigma 1–15 Microfuge (Sigma, Germany). The supernatant was removed by
sterile pipetting and DNA extracted from the remaining
pellet using the QIAamp DNA Minikit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the Tissue Extraction protocol supplied by the manufacturer. For Naegleria cultures, a
loopful of cells was aseptically transferred from the edge
of a plaque into 20 μL of Instagene (Bio-Rad USA) and
DNA extracted from the cells according to the protocol
supplied by the manufacturer. Oocyst DNA was extracted
by 5 cycles of freeze thawing in liquid nitrogen followed
by Instagene extraction following the manufacturer's
instructions.
Amplification and melting curve analysis in the presence of
SYTO9
PCRs were performed using a Rotor-Gene 3000 (Corbett
Research, Sydney, Australia). Cryptosporidium 18S rDNA
was amplified as described by Keegan et al [31], except
that the Taqman probe was excluded and SYTO9 was
added at a final concentration of 2.5 μM. Naegleria PCR
was performed as described by Robinson et al [12].
Cyanobacterial PCRs were performed in 25 μL reaction

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/107

volumes containing variant amounts of genomic DNA,
500 nM of forward and reverse primer (Geneworks, Australia), 0.2 μM deoxynucleotide triphosphates (Promega,
USA), 1 × Platinum Taq PCR buffer (Invitrogen, USA), 1
U of Platinum Taq (Invitrogen, USA), 2.5 μM SYTO9 and
4 mM MgCl2 (Invitrogen, USA). For cyanobacterial templates, the thermal cycling conditions included an initial
denaturation at 94°C for 2 min, followed by 50 cycles at
94°C for 5 s and 60°C for 25 s, with data acquisition on
the FAM channel following the 60°C anneal/extension
step. The amplified PCR products were visualised on 1.5%
agarose gels stained with Gelstar (Cambrex Bio Science,
USA) to check product formation and sizes of the products were estimated from a DNA molecular weight
marker: pUC19/HpaII digest (Geneworks, Australia).
Melting curve conditions included an initial hold step of
70°C for 1 min, followed by temperature ramping of
0.5°C/30 s to 99°C. SYTO9 was detected in the FAM
channel (excitation at 470 nm, detection at 510 nm) using
a gain setting of 2. Melting curves were initially visualised
using the Rotor Gene Analysis software (version 6) with
the digital filter set to none. For preparation of graphs data
were exported from Rotor Gene experiment files into Origin 7 (OriginLab Corporation) and lines were drawn
through points using a b-spline.
Melting curve analysis of Naegleria DNA amplified in the
absence of DNA binding dye
Naegleria DNA was amplified as described above except
that SYTO9 was omitted from the reaction mixture.
Amplicons were purified using Montage PCR purification
columns (Millipore, USA) according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. Purified amplicons amplified
from the same template were pooled and the mass of
DNA in each of the pools calculated by UV spectrophotometric analysis using a GeneQuant Pro (Biochrom, UK).
The mass of DNA in each of the pools was adjusted to 30
ng/μL. For the melting analysis, all reactions were melted
with 25 μL total reaction volumes containing 120 ng of
test amplicon DNA, 2.5 mM MgCl2 (Perkin-Elmer, USA),
1 × PCR buffer II (Perkin-Elmer, USA) and either 0.25 ×
SYBR Green I (Invitrogen, USA), 1 × LC Green (IT Biochem, USA), 2 μM SYTO 9 (Invitrogen, USA) or 2 μM
SYTO 59 (Invitrogen, USA). Melting curve conditions
included three repetitions of the following cycle: two initial hold steps for 1 min each, 95°C then 60°C, followed
by temperature ramping of 0.5°C/30 s from 70 to 99°C.
SYTO9 and LC Green were detected in the FAM channel
(excitation at 470 nm, detection at 510 nm) at a gain of 6
and 10 respectively, SYBR Green I was detected in the
SYBR channel (excitation at 470 nm, detection at 585 nm)
at a gain of 7.33 and SYTO59 was detected in the Cy5
channel (excitation at 625 nm, detection at 660 nm) using
a gain setting of 8.67. Melting curves were visualised by

the analysis software (Rotor Gene Analysis Software 6.0
build 34) with the digital filter set to none. The purified
amplicons used in the melting analyses were visualised on
1.5% agarose gels as described above to confirm that the
amplicons were single products of the correct sizes.
Melting simulations
GenBank accession numbers for DNA sequences used in
the computer simulations are: AJ132027 (Naegleria fowleri
NG166), AJ132034 (Naegleria australiensis LSR34),
X96569 (Naegleria lovaniensis F9, which is identical to
Naegleria lovaniensis NG034), AF093496 (Cryptosporidium
muris), AF040725 (Cryptosporidium parvum), AF395828
(Aphanizomenon ovalisporum, nucleotides 3975 – 4242)
and DQ531847 (Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii). Where
required, sequences were truncated to remove sequences
outside of the region bounded by the primers. Melting
simulations were performed using the POLAND program
[32] and the MELTSIM for Windows program [33].
Poland was set to use the Blake and Delcourt model for
melting [20], and both programs were set to simulate
melting curves between 60°C and 90°C, incrementing by
0.5°C, with a fixed salt concentration of 75 mM NaCl.
Critical output data relevant to this study were the "differentiated hypochromicity at 260 and 282 nm (dA/dT) vs.
temperature" plot and the first and second order reaction
stack indices for temperature pf 50% probability for
POLAND and the "theta (the calculated fraction of base
pairs remaining in a helical state) vs. temperature" plot
and melt map plot for MELTSIM.
