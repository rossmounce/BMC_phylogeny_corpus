Abstract
Background: The fox tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis has foxes and other canids as definitive host and
rodents as intermediate hosts. However, most mammals can be accidental intermediate hosts and the larval stage
may cause serious disease in humans. The parasite has never been detected in Sweden, Finland and mainland
Norway. All three countries require currently an anthelminthic treatment for dogs and cats prior to entry in order
to prevent introduction of the parasite. Documentation of freedom from E. multilocularis is necessary for
justification of the present import requirements.
Methods: The probability that Sweden, Finland and mainland Norway were free from E. multilocularis and the
sensitivity of the surveillance systems were estimated using scenario trees. Surveillance data from five animal
species were included in the study: red fox (Vulpes vulpes), raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides), domestic pig,
wild boar (Sus scrofa) and voles and lemmings (Arvicolinae).
Results: The cumulative probability of freedom from EM in December 2009 was high in all three countries, 0.98
(95% CI 0.96-0.99) in Finland and 0.99 (0.97-0.995) in Sweden and 0.98 (0.95-0.99) in Norway.
Conclusions: Results from the model confirm that there is a high probability that in 2009 the countries were free
from E. multilocularis. The sensitivity analyses showed that the choice of the design prevalences in different
infected populations was influential. Therefore more knowledge on expected prevalences for E. multilocularis in
infected populations of different species is desirable to reduce residual uncertainty of the results.

Background
The fox tape worm Echinococcus multilocularis (EM) is
a parasite of public health significance. The life cycle
involves foxes and other canids as definitive hosts and
rodents as intermediate hosts [1] although many other
mammals species can be aberrant intermediate hosts
(Figure 1). Humans become infected via the oral route,
probably via contaminated hands after handling infected
canids, contaminated plants or soil or through eating
contaminated berries [1,2]. Human infection with EM
can result in alveolar echinococcosis, a serious disease.

If untreated the mortality exceeds 90% within 10 years,
if treated the survival rate after five years increased to
88% [3].
EM is endemic in large parts of Europe [1] and the
parasite is increasingly reported from countries near
Sweden, Finland and Norway [4-7]. There is evidence
that the parasite may be emerging in Europe [3,8-11].
EM is notifiable in humans and animals and has never
been found in Sweden, Finland and mainland Norway.
This favourable situation is probably largely attributed
to the fact that this area is geographically isolated from
countries where EM has been detected in combination
with stringent import regulations including a requirement for anthelminthic treatment of companion animals

(i.e. cats, dogs and ferrets). Furthermore EM has not
been reported from adjacent areas of Russian Karelia,
and according to Henttonen et al. [12], in all probability
not on the Kola Peninsula. In Sweden, Finland and Norway, the climate is favourable for EM and susceptible
hosts occur [13], hence it is possible that EM could be
established if accidentally introduced. Once established
in an area it is considered impossible to eradicate EM
because of the sylvatic life cycle [14].
The present EU regulation allows Sweden, Finland,
UK, Ireland and Malta to maintain national rules for the
entry of companion animals over a transitional period to

protect them from imported EM infections. In addition
Norway (mainland) considers itself free from EM and
has separate import regulations for pets from countries
other than ones mentioned above. However, these special requirements may be costly and laborious for the
pet owner and could be considered disproportionate. If
a country wants to maintain stricter national import
regulations for dogs and cats than EU generally, it
should be able to plausibly demonstrate its freedom
from EM. The aim of this study was to assess the EM
status of Sweden, Finland and mainland Norway using
past surveillance data. The study shows that there is a

high probability that the three countries were free from
EM in 2009.

Methods
Design of the study

The probability that Sweden, Finland and mainland
Norway are free of EM and the sensitivity of the surveillance systems for EM, i.e. the probability of case detection, were estimated using the method described by
Martin et al. [15]. By use of modelling, the method
allows combining results from several independent components of a complex surveillance system into a single
measure; i.e. the sensitivity of the combined surveillance
activities. The model can be graphically presented by
scenario trees (Figure 2) that contain infection and
detection nodes, and illustrate all possible pathways
from the starting point (the population is infected) to
the outcome (negative or positive test results) [15]. The
model is based on two key assumptions: All results of
the surveillance system are negative, i.e. disease is not
detected, and the specificity of the surveillance system is
100%, i.e. each surveillance system component (SSC)
(Table 1) is defined to include any necessary follow-up
testing of potentially false positive results [15]. In the
present study, the method was extended to combine
information from surveillance systems in up to five different populations. A design prevalence was specified
for each population surveyed (see further explanation
below). Given the defined design prevalences (P*) the
probability of freedom by country was calculated. The
study period was from 1 January 2000 to 31 December
2009 and the surveillance for each year was modelled
separately.

Design prevalence

The design prevalence P* is the probability that an animal is infected given that the infection is present in the
country. For each species, a separate design prevalence
was specified (Table 3) based on prevalence estimates
previously published. For foxes and raccoon dogs a
design prevalence of 1% was used in agreement with the
suggestions for harmonized monitoring of EM within
the European Union [16].
For pigs the design prevalence was based on results
from surveys for EM performed by inspection of pig
livers at the slaughter house. In Hokkaido, between
1983 and 2007, approximately 0.1% of slaughtered pigs
were reported to have livers with lesions due to EM
[14,17,18]. In Lithuania, lesions due to EM were found
in 0.5% of pigs (n = 612) from small family farms [19]
and in Switzerland, livers from 10% of fattening pigs (n
= 90) raised outdoors, originating from six farms with a
high proportion of condemned livers, had EM lesions
[20]. As these estimates originate from (high) endemic
areas it was expected that the prevalence at the country
level would be lower. Based on expert opinion, it was
decided to use 10% of the lowest estimate, i.e. 0.01% as
the design prevalence for the whole country.
Reports of EM found in wild boars [21,22] were not
considered sufficient for estimation of the design prevalence. However, wild boars are expected to be more
exposed to EM than domestic pigs, hence it was decided
to use twice the design prevalence of pigs, i.e. 0.02%.

The prevalence estimates of EM in voles are reported
to vary between as well as within species [23,24]. The
common vole (Microtus arvalis) and water vole (Arvicola amphibious previously called A. terrestris) are considered to be the most important intermediate hosts in
Central Europe [23-25]. Water vole is common in Nordic countries, but common vole does not occur in Sweden and Norway and has a very limited distribution in
Finland. However, other Microtus species do occur in
the area. Most of the rodents of this study (70-90%)
were bank voles (Myodes glareolus), and the prevalence
was set to fit that species. The reported prevalence estimates for this species varied from 2.4% to 10.3%
[26-28]. In accordance with the reasoning for pigs, the
design prevalence was set to 10% of the lowest estimate,
i.e. 0.24%.
Test sensitivity

The sedimentation and counting technique (SCT) is
considered the reference test for EM in definitive hosts.
The sensitivity has been estimated to be 98% to 100%
[24,29]. However the lower bound for the sensitivity
(98%) as estimated by Eckert [30] was considered to be
too high for a country where EM has never been diagnosed and therefore the personnel being less experienced (personal communication, Dan Christensson). In
the present study, the sensitivity of SCT was therefore
described with a Pert distribution with the parameters
(0.9, 0.98, 1) [31].
The coproantigen ELISA (CoA) was estimated to have
a sensitivity of 83.6% when investigating 87 wild foxes of

Page 4 of 13

which 55 were found positive in the SCT test [32]. In
foxes with a detected parasite burden of > 21 worms the
sensitivity of CoA reached 93.3%, but in foxes with ≤ 20
worms it was only 40% [32]. The sensitivity was
described with a Pert distribution with parameters (0.40,
0.84, 0.93). The same estimates for sensitivity for CoA
were used for foxes and raccoon dogs as the excretion
of coproantigen is not expected to vary significantly
between these species [33].
The overall diagnostic sensitivity of the modified taeniid egg isolation from faeces [34,35] and multiplex PCR
[36,37] used in Norway was described by Pert distribution with the parameters 0.29, 0.5 and 0.72 [38]. In Finland, a modified taeniid egg isolation (McMaster with
sucrose, specific gravity 1.25) was used with a sensitivity
that was assumed to be 35% of the method used in Norway [19].
Meat inspectors in Sweden, Norway and Finland are
not expected to be familiar with the white nodular
lesions in the pig liver caused by EM. The pathological
characteristics in pigs, an aberrant intermediate hosts,
differ from rodents, the natural intermediate host. Most
of the detected lesions have been described as small and
calcified and may look similar to non-essential lesions
such as “white spots” caused by passage of ascarid larvae
[17]. Therefore the probability that EM lesions would be
detected during meat inspection was estimated to be
approximately 0.1 and was described by a Pert distribution with parameters 0.01, 0.1 and 0.2. The probability
of taking a sample for further examination varies among
the countries. In Norway, laboratory examination of
samples is free only when a notifiable disease is suspected and the probability that a sample would be taken
was considered to be very low and was described by a
Pert distribution with parameters 0.1, 0.2 0.3, based on
estimates from meat inspectors. In Sweden and Finland,
the probability of sampling was expected to be higher as
all samples can be submitted for further examination
without any costs. However, as the probability is difficult
to estimate, a conservative approach was chosen and the
estimate for Norway was used for all three countries
(Table 3).
Identification of EM lesions in pigs and wild boars by
histological examination can be very difficult as older
lesions very often are calcified and only fragments of the
laminated layer of the parasite can be found. It can be
expected that such lesions will not be identified by
pathologists unfamiliar with EM. If a PCR is done on all
putative lesions, the sensitivity of laboratory examinations is estimated to be a minimum of 80%, most likely
90% and a maximum of 95% (personal communication,
Peter Deplazes). However, as EM has never been diagnosed in any of the three countries, it cannot be
expected that all potentially suspect lesions will be

submitted for further examination by PCR. The probability of diagnosing EM, if an EM lesion was sent to
the lab, was estimated to be rather low and was
described by Pert distribution with parameters (0.1, 0.4,
0.5) (Table 3). In wild boars, meat inspection is usually
performed by laymen and the overall sensitivity of meat

inspection was considered to be lower, we assumed it to
be 50% of the sensitivity in domestic pigs.
In Finland, voles were dissected as part of regular
long-term surveillance of small rodent populations by
the Finnish Forest Research Institute. Voles were dissected by experienced biologists paying special attention

to liver lesions. Thus, parasitic cysts were reliably investigated and identified at the species or genus level by
morphology, sometimes also genetically for Taenia phylogenetics [39]. Consequently, the sensitivity of dissections, i.e. the probability of detecting a liver lesion due
to EM, is estimated to be high and was described by
Pert distribution with parameters (0.8, 0.9, 0.99) (personal communication, Heikki Henttonen) (Table 3). As
the dissections of rodents in Sweden were performed by
laymen, the sensitivity was estimated to be 10% compared to the estimate in Finland (Table 3).
Probability of introduction

In Sweden and Norway, dogs that are introduced from
countries where EM is endemic and that do not comply
with import requirements, are considered to be the most
important pathway for introduction of EM. In Finland,
the risk of introduction by wildlife is also considered
important as EM is now present in neighbouring Estonia
[40]. The annual risk of introducing at least one infected
dog to Sweden has, depending on the degree of compliance with the import requirements, been estimated to be
0.64, 0.45 and 0.13 assuming 90%, 95% or 99.9% compliance, respectively [41]. The degree of compliance is

unknown. In the UK it is estimated to be approximately
95% to 96% (personal communication, Tonima Saha).
A risk of introduction of minimum of 0.13, most likely
0.45 and a maximum of 0.64, based on a 99%, 95% and
90% compliance was therefore used in this study.
The probability of establishment was considered to be
dependent on the probability of infected dogs excreting
eggs and the probability of excreted eggs starting an
endemic cycle. Of the total infection period in dogs of
approximately 120 days, the prepatent period constitutes
approximately 28 days and the effective patent period
approximately 43 days (95% CI 21.9-93.1) [33,42]. Therefore, it was assumed that dogs imported after 71 (28+43)
days post infection would excrete very few eggs and were
assumed to not initiate an endemic cycle. Consequently,
approximately 60% (71/120) (95% CI 42% (49.9/120)
-100% (121/120) of imported infected dogs would excrete
sufficient eggs for initiating an endemic cycle. Furthermore, it was expected that the risk of initiating an endemic cycle would differ depending on the presence and
number of suitable hosts. As no data were available, it
was estimated that 50% (minimum 30% and maximum
70%) of infected dogs would excrete eggs in areas suitable

Wahlström et al. Acta Veterinaria Scandinavica 2011, 53:9
http://www.actavetscand.com/content/53/1/9

to initiate an endemic cycle. Hence, the risk of introduction and establishment by dogs was described as a conditional probability parameterised with:
Pert(0.13, 0.45, 0.64) × Pert(0.42, 0.6, 1) × Pert(0.3,
0.5, 0.7) Where Pert(0.13, 0.45, 0.64) is the risk of introduction, Pert(0.42, 0.6, 1) is the probability that an
introduced infected dog would excrete eggs and Pert
(0.3, 0.5, 0.7) is the probability that an endemic cycle is
initiated given introduction of an infected dog excreting
eggs (Table 3). The estimated total number of dogs in
Norway and Finland are approximately 50% and 75%,
respectively, of the Swedish populations and the number
of dogs entering the country was assumed to be proportional to the total number of dogs in each country.
Therefore, the risk of introduction of EM by dogs was
assumed to be 50% and 75% of the Swedish risk for
Norway and Finland, respectively. EM is present in Estonia south of Finland and infected foxes or raccoon dogs
may carry the infection to Finland via the Karelian Isthmus (> 300 km) or in midwinter by passing over frozen
Gulf of Finland (52-120 km). This risk is dependent on
number of host-related and environmental factors difficult to assess. However, the risk was considered less
than that of numerous imported dogs and was estimated
on average to be 50% of the risk of dog import.
Calculation of surveillance system sensitivity

The sensitivity was calculated annually for each surveillance system component (SSCSe Sp ) and then for the
whole surveillance system (SSSe).
Surveillance system component sensitivity

The annual sample sensitivity, i.e. the sensitivity for each
sample of animals (Sa) within an animal species tested
with test (t) given that the species was infected at the
design prevalence for that species (P*Sp), was calculated as:
Sa s Se Sp ,t ,y  1  [(1  Se t  P *Sp ) ^ (N s ,Sp ,t ,y )]

Where Sas is the sample s, Set is the sensitivity of the
test t, Ns, Sp, t, y is the number of animals in the sample s
of species Sp tested with test t in year y (Table 3) and
P*Sp is the design prevalence for the species Sp (Table 2).
The annual sensitivity for SSC for a single species and a
single year, i.e. the probability of a positive test result in
at least one individual animal in any of the samples of
animals tested that year, was calculated according to the
binomial distribution. For a SSC with two samples tested
with different tests the sensitivity was calculated as:
SSCSe Sp ,y  1

[(1  Sa s1Se Sp ,t1,y )  (1  Sa s 2Se Sp ,t 2,y )]

Where 1- SasSeSp,t,y is the probability of not detecting
EM in the sample s of animals of species Sp tested with
test t in year y.

Calculation of the probability of freedom from EM in the
country

The probability that the country is free from EM was
calculated using Bayes theorem [15]. The posterior
probability of freedom from infection (corresponding to
the negative predictive value of a diagnostic test) was
calculated for each of the 10 years as:
PostPFree y  1  PriorPInf y / (1  PriorPInf y  SSCSe y )

Where PriorPInfy is the pre-surveillance probability
that the country is infected and SSCSey is the sensitivity
of all SSCs in year y. Although the infection has never
been recorded in Sweden, Finland and Norway, a noninformative prior probability of infection (0.5) in January
2000 was used, assuming no prior information about the
disease status. The SSCSey i.e. the sensitivity of all SSCs
in year y, was calculated according to the binomial
distribution:
5

SSCSe y  1 

  1  SSCSe 
Sp , y

Sp 1

Where 1- SSCSeSp, y is the probability of not detecting
EM in species Sp during year y.
The probability of introduction (PIntro) during one
year y represents the probability that disease is introduced in the country and established at the design prevalences (P*). Either the infection may occur from a
starting point of complete absence or the infection level
may increase from some low level (<P*) to exceed P*
during the next year, y+1. The prior probability that the
country is infected at the beginning of y+1 is given by
the function [15]:
PriorPInf y 1  PostInf y  PIntro y 1  ( PostPInf y  PIntro y 1)

Where PriorPInfy+1 is the prior probability of infection
in year y+1, PostInfy is the posterior probability of infection in year y and PIntro y+1 is the probability of introduction in year y+1.
Scenario analysis

A scenario analysis was performed by running two “whatif” scenarios to evaluate the effect of changes in the input
variables on the probability of freedom: i) The prior
probability of infection was decreased from 0.5 to 0.2 to
include prior knowledge of absence of human cases,
ii) The design prevalence for foxes was decreased from
1% to 0.5% and 0.05%. These estimates reflect the lowest
prevalence estimate found in the literature [43,44] and
10% of the lowest reported prevalence in accordance
with reasoning for the other species included in the
study. Furthermore two “what-if” scenarios were run to

Wahlström et al. Acta Veterinaria Scandinavica 2011, 53:9
http://www.actavetscand.com/content/53/1/9

evaluate the effect on the sensitivity of the surveillance
system in the surveyed species: i) the sensitivity for dissection of rodents in Sweden was increased to Pert(0.8,
0.9, 0.99), i.e. the same as used for Finland, reflecting dissections performed by experts and ii) the probability of
detecting EM lesions in pigs, the probability of submitting a suspected lesion to the laboratory and the probability of diagnosing a submitted sample at the laboratory
was increased to Pert(0.4, 0.5, 0.6), Pert(0.8, 0.9, 0.99) and
Pert(0.8, 0.9, 0.95) respectively. These values reflect what
could be expected following the education of meat
inspectors and assuming that all suspected lesions were
tested with PCR.
Stochastic simulation

The model was developed using Excel 2007 (Microsoft
Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA) and @RISK, (Palisade, Newfield, NY, USA). The model was run with
5000 iterations for each scenario.

Results
Probability of freedom from EM

The cumulative probability of freedom from EM in
December 2009 was high in all three countries, 0.98
(95% Credibility Interval 0.96-0.99) in Finland and 0.99
(0.97-0.995) in Sweden and 0.98 (0.95-0.99) in Norway.
Results from the model indicate that the probability of
freedom in Finland has been high since 2000, in Sweden
since 2001 and in Norway since 2007 (Figure 3).
Surveillance system sensitivity

The estimated annual sensitivity of the surveillance system in Finland was high during the whole study period,
in Sweden and Norway it was high from 2001 and 2007
respectively (Figure 3). In Finland surveillance in rodents
was the component with the highest sensitivity followed
by surveillance in foxes and raccoon dogs. In Sweden
and Norway surveillance in foxes was the component
with the highest sensitivity (Figure 4). The annual sensitivity of the surveillance system component for rodents
during years 2005 to 2007 and raccoon dogs during
years 2008 and 2009 in Sweden was approximately 0.2
(Figure 4A). The annual sensitivity for components
domestic pigs and wild boars was below 0.01 in all
countries except Sweden where the sensitivity in wild
boars increased over the years from < 0.01 to 0.03 in
2009.
Scenario analysis

By reducing the prior probability of infection in the year
2000 to 0.2, the probability of freedom became slightly
higher during the first years of the study period but it
did not have any impact on the probability of freedom
at the end of 2009. In Sweden the probability of

Page 8 of 13

freedom in 2000 increased from 0.53 (Figure 3A) to
0.82. In Norway, the probability of freedom between
2000 and 2006 varied between 0.47 - 0.66 (Figure 3C)
and increased to 0.74 - 0.81 when using a lower prior
probability of infection. For Finland and for the remaining years in Sweden and Norway, when the sensitivity of
the surveillance systems as well as the probabilities of
freedom were high (Figure 3), reducing the prior probability of infection did not have any major impact on
the probability of freedom. When the design prevalence
in foxes was decreased from 1% to 0.5% and 0.05%, the
probability of freedom in 2009 decreased to 0.95 and
0.54 for Sweden and 0.90 and 0.35 for Norway while it
remained at 0.98 in Finland. By increasing the sensitivity
of the surveillance in rodents in Sweden to the same
level as in Finland, the annual sensitivity of this surveillance system component increased from 0.20 to 0.88 in
the period 2005 to 2007. Finally, increasing the overall
sensitivity of meat inspection in pigs from 0.007 to 0.4
and in wild boars from 0.004 to 0.2 increased the annual
sensitivity of the surveillance system component pigs
and wild boars to approximately 0.3 and 0.85 in Sweden
(Figure 5). In Finland and Norway it was low, < 0.2 and
< 0.1 in pigs and wild boars.

Discussion
The results of the model confirm that there is a very
high probability that Sweden, Finland and mainland
Norway are free from EM at the set design prevalences.
Even though the surveillance differs between countries
as seen in table 2, the most significant contribution to
this conclusion originates from the surveillance of foxes
in all three countries. However, in Finland the raccoon
dog SSC and the vole SSC also had a very high sensitivity. This highlights that additional species to foxes and
raccoon dogs as suggested in the EFSA report [16] can
also be important in surveillance systems for EM. The
sensitivity of pig SSC and wild boar SSC was low in all
three countries. This is in contrast to Japan where meat
inspection of pigs is considered highly informative to
monitor the presence of EM [14]. However, when the
sensitivity of meat inspection for pigs and wild boars
was increased to 0.4 and 0.2 the annual sensitivity of
these SSCs in Sweden increased up to approximately 0.3
and 0.8 respectively (Figure 5). This could be achieved
by educating meat inspectors and laymen performing
meat inspections in wild boars. Wild boars are especially
interesting as they are more exposed to faeces from wild
carnivores and reports from the literature show that
lesions due to EM can be found in this species [21,22].
In this study this was reflected by using a higher design
prevalence in wild boars compared to pigs. Therefore,
surveillance in wild boars might be valuable for documenting EM status in the areas were wild boars are

present, i.e. in the southern half of Sweden, south of
latitude 61°N and to some extent also in southeastern
Finland where the small wild boar population is slowly
increasing. In Norway, this mode of surveillance is not
yet feasible due to very low numbers of wild boars in
nature. As wild boar carcasses usually are inspected by
laymen, it will be crucial to document their competence

in identifying EM lesions for such a surveillance strategy
to get international acceptance. The results of this study
are based on many assumptions. When data from literature were lacking, estimates based on expert opinion has
been used. To avoid over estimate of the probability of
freedom, precaucionary estimates were often used.
Therefore, it was concluded that the main results of this

study would still be valid, although other experts may
give different estimates.
The European Food Safety Authority’s recommendations for a surveillance programme to document freedom
from EM [16] are based on surveillance in foxes or raccoon dogs only. However, EM has a life cycle involving
several species and the first reported detection of EM in

a country has been both in the main hosts such as foxes
and in intermediate hosts such as voles or humans [45].
In this study, information from several species was combined into one measure for the probability of freedom of
the country. Thereby, when documenting disease freedom, the number of samples per species can be adjusted
so that the most cost-efficient samples are collected.

Figure 5 The annual sensitivity of surveillance systems for
Echinococcus multilocularis assuming increased sensitivity of
meat inspection. The study period is from January 2000 to
December 2009 and includes surveillance of five different species in
Sweden.

In the present study the scenario analysis showed that
lowering the prior probability of infection, reflecting
absence of human cases of AE, increased the probability
of freedom during the first years of the study period but
it did not have any impact on the probability of freedom
in 2009. However if the sensitivity of the surveillance
system had been lower, the effect of using a lower prior
can be expected to be higher. It was concluded that
absence of cases of AE, given an efficient surveillance
system and compulsory notification, is important when
demonstrating freedom from EM.
The choice of design prevalence is a crucial part to
demonstrate freedom from infection as a “higher” level
of surveillance is needed to demonstrate freedom from
infection at a lower design prevalence [15]. This relation
was highlighted in the scenario analysis in the present
study, showing that the probability of freedom decreased
when the design prevalence in foxes was decreased.
When defining the target design prevalences, international standards should preferably be used [15]. However, as the design prevalences used in standards vary
greatly between diseases and as no standards for EM
exist, a design prevalence of 1% for foxes or raccoon
dogs as suggested by EFSA, was used in the present
study [16]. It could however be questioned if the same
design prevalence, as suggested in the EFSA report,
should be used for foxes and raccoon dogs as the prevalence in raccoon dogs are reported to be lower compared to foxes [46-48]. However, the diet of raccoon
dogs is highly variable and differs geographically [49]. In
Finland, the proportion of mammals in their diets
appears to be higher than in Germany and Lithuania
[49] and voles as food are almost equally frequent for
raccoon dogs as for foxes in Finland [50]. Consequently,
the same P* was used for both canid species in this

Page 11 of 13

study. For the remaining species, the use of 10% of the
lowest prevalence estimate found in literature can be
regarded as a precautionary estimate based on expert
opinion.
Although surveillance of disease occurrence in different species has been included in studies to document
freedom [51], to the authors’ knowledge, combining
results of surveillance for one disease in a number of
different species using separate design prevalences has
not previously been used. However, more knowledge on
the expected prevalences of EM in different species is
necessary to optimize the surveillance when using surveillance data from several species to document disease
freedom.
In our model, the annual probability of introduction
and establishment of EM was assumed to be rather high
in all three countries (Figure 3) which might seem to
contradict the results of the study showing that all three
countries most probably are free from EM. This might
be explained by EM already being introduced and established, but at a prevalence below the design prevalence.
If EM was introduced the geographical spread may be
very slow as reported from Japan [14]. Another possible
explanation is that the risk of introduction and establishment is overestimated. The probability of introduction and establishment is based on a risk assessment for
EM introduction to Sweden [41]. The true number of
dogs introduced is not known and the risk assessment
uses a conservative estimate that may be too high.
Furthermore, the report does not differentiate between
animals imported and animals in transit, the latter probably constituting in a smaller risk of excreting eggs in
the environment. No data were available on the risk of
establishment given introduction of an infected canid.
However, the estimate used in the study may be too
high as dogs travel freely between other European countries and EM is not reported to be present in all these
countries. It was therefore concluded that the estimated
combined risk of introduction and establishment may be
too high.
According to the EFSA report, the sample size needed
to document freedom from EM infection, i.e. to detect a
prevalence of 1% with 95% confidence [16], can be collected during a five-year period, without taking into
account the risk of introduction. Therefore, the surveillance systems designs assessed in this study more than
fulfills the recommendations provided by the EFSA.

Conclusions
Results indicate that there is a high probability that Sweden, Finland and mainland Norway were free from E.
multilocularis by the end of 2009 based on surveillance
results collected from January 2000 to December 2009.
The study showed that the method described by Martin

Wahlström et al. Acta Veterinaria Scandinavica 2011, 53:9
http://www.actavetscand.com/content/53/1/9

et al. could be successfully applied using surveillance
data from several animal species to quantify the probability of disease freedom and to estimate the sensitivity
of the surveillance systems. The scenario analyses
showed that the choice of the design prevalences was
important for the result and that more knowledge is
needed on expected prevalences of E. multilocularis in
infected populations of different species.
