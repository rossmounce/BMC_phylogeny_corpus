Mitochondrial genes support a common origin
of rodent malaria parasites and Plasmodium
falciparum’s relatives infecting great apes
Samuel Blanquart1,2,3* and Olivier Gascuel1

Abstract
Background: Plasmodium falciparum is responsible for the most acute form of human malaria. Most recent studies
demonstrate that it belongs to a monophyletic lineage specialized in the infection of great ape hosts. Several other
Plasmodium species cause human malaria. They all belong to another distinct lineage of parasites which infect a
wider range of primate species. All known mammalian malaria parasites appear to be monophyletic. Their clade
includes the two previous distinct lineages of parasites of primates and great apes, one lineage of rodent parasites,
and presumably Hepatocystis species. Plasmodium falciparum and great ape parasites are commonly thought to be
the sister-group of all other mammal-infecting malaria parasites. However, some studies supported contradictory
origins and found parasites of great apes to be closer to those of rodents, or to those of other primates.
Results: To distinguish between these mutually exclusive hypotheses on the origin of Plasmodium falciparum and
its great ape infecting relatives, we performed a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis based on a data set of three
mitochondrial genes from 33 to 84 malaria parasites. We showed that malarial mitochondrial genes have evolved
slowly and are compositionally homogeneous. We estimated their phylogenetic relationships using Bayesian and
maximum-likelihood methods. Inferred trees were checked for their robustness to the (i) site selection, (ii)
assumptions of various probabilistic models, and (iii) taxon sampling. Our results robustly support a common
ancestry of rodent parasites and Plasmodium falciparum’s relatives infecting great apes.
Conclusions: Our results refute the most common view of the origin of great ape malaria parasites, and instead
demonstrate the robustness of a less well-established phylogenetic hypothesis, under which Plasmodium
falciparum and its relatives infecting great apes are closely related to rodent parasites. This study sheds light on the
evolutionary history of Plasmodium falciparum, a major issue for human health.

Background
Malaria is an overwhelming public health problem all
over the world. It kills one to three million people
annually and infects 200 to 500 million others [1].
Human malaria is induced by infections caused by a
range of eukaryotic protists belonging to the phylum
Apicomplexa. These organisms possess an endosymbiont
of red algal origin [2] derived into an apical organelle,
the apicoplast. This organelle is specialized in host cell
invasion [3]. Within Apicomplexa, malaria parasites, also

called Haemosporidia, are characterized by their infection of vertebrate hosts, haemoglobin digestion, and a
complex life cycle involving dipteran vectors feeding
from their vertebrate hosts’ blood [4].
Haemosporidia include the genera Leucocytozoon (bird
parasites), Haemoproteus and Parahaemoproteus (Sauria,
i.e. bird and reptile parasites), Plasmodium (saurian and
mammalian parasites) and Hepatocystis (mammalian
parasites) [4-6]. These five genera have long been
defined by their morphological differences (e.g. storage
of products of haemoglobin degradation in the case of
Haemoproteus, Parahaemoproteus, Plasmodium and
Hepatocystis), variations in their life cycle (e.g. asexual
replication stage in erythrocytes for Haemoproteus,
Parahaemoproteus and Plasmodium) and host and

vector specificity [4,5,7,8]. However, studies which
attempted to link these phenotypic and life history traits
with molecular data concluded that the latter provide
deeper insight into the evolutionary history of Haemosporidia, and allow the identification of cryptic species
which cannot be distinguished using only microscopy
observations [9,10]. The increasing availability of molecular data has enabled numerous studies of Haemosporidia phylogeny, improving our understanding of the
evolutionary history of malaria parasites.
To date, five Plasmodium species have been shown to
cause human malaria: P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae, P. ovale and P. knowlesi [11-14]. P. falciparum has
stimulated the interest of the scientific community, largely because it is the most virulent, but also because of
the very high A+T contents of its genome. Indeed, it
has an average content of 80% A+T over its nuclear
genome, with intergenic regions frequently displaying
more than 90% A+T [15]. Furthermore, the question of
the origin of P. falciparum is intriguing: its 18 S rRNA
gene diverges strikingly from that of the other Plasmodium species which infect primates, of which four cause
human malaria [16-19]. Another parasite of interest is P.
reichenowi, which infects chimpanzees. P. reichenowi has
long been the only known close relative of P. falciparum
[6,18-24]. However, since 2009, it has been recognized
that both P. falciparum and P. reichenowi belong to a
wider monophyletic lineage of parasites specialized in
the infection of great ape hosts: gorilla, chimpanzee,
bonobo and human [25-28].
Despite intense efforts to obtain accurate molecular phylogenies, the position of P. falciparum and of great ape
malaria parasites within Haemosporidia remains unclear.
In recent decades, many molecular phylogenies have been
produced which clustered P. falciparum (alone, or with P.
reichenowi) closer to avian than to mammalian parasites
(Figure 1A). This led to the hypothesis of a recent switch
from avian to human (and great ape) hosts, rather than a
shared ancestry of P. falciparum and other mammalian
malaria parasites [16-19,21,29-35]. However, it has

recently been recognized that, in these early works, the
clustering of P. falciparum with avian malaria parasites
may have resulted mainly from stochastic noise due to the
insufficient number of sequences analyzed [35]. More
recent studies relied on larger data sets and demonstrated
that all malaria parasites known to exclusively infect mammals, including P. falciparum, are monophyletic
[6,20-28,36]. Hence, this monophyletic clade of mammalian malaria parasites includes (i) a lineage infecting great
apes [25-28], (ii) a distantly related and less specialized
lineage infecting primates [11], (iii) a third lineage of
rodent parasites [6,37], and (iv) species of the Hepatocystis
genus infecting bats and primates [5,6,21]. Most studies
inferred great ape parasites to be a sister-group to all other
mammal parasites [6,20-22,24,25,27,28,36] (Figure 1B).
However, a few studies yielded contradictory results. Some
suggested that great ape parasites could be closer to other
primate parasites [14] (Figure 1C), while others suggested
that great ape parasites could be related to rodent parasites
[23,27] (Figure 1D).
In the present study, we distinguished between these
mutually exclusive hypotheses to identify the origin of
Plasmodium falciparum and other great ape parasites.
We analyzed three genes from 33 publicly available complete Haemosporidian mitochondrial genomes, as well as
51 additional sets of one to three mitochondrial genes
from Hepatocystis and Plasmodium species infecting
various mammalian and saurian hosts. Concatenated
nucleotide and amino-acid alignments were analyzed
using various probabilistic models of sequence evolution,
applying both maximum-likelihood (ML) and Bayesian
inference (BI) methods. Statistical measurements of
fit and posterior predictive experiments enabled the adequacy of model assumptions to the data to be checked.
We also evaluated the robustness of the obtained phylogeny to the taxonomic sampling by removing and adding
taxa. Our phylogenetic analyses provide robust support
for a close relationship between great ape and rodent
parasites (Figure 1D).

In this study, we analyzed coding genes from the
33 complete Haemosporidian mitochondrial genomes
available in 2009 (see Methods and Additional file 1,
Table S1). Each genome includes only three coding
genes. In this section, we describe the general features
of the resulting alignments.
In the three concatenated genes and 33 taxa data set,
54% of the 1099 amino-acid sites, and 51% of the 3308
nucleotide sites were constant. The nucleotide and
amino-acid alignments are thus highly conserved. Genes
displayed the typical pattern in which substitution rates
are higher at the third and first codon positions, and

Blanquart and Gascuel BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:70
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/70

lower at the second codon positions. The first and second codon positions are highly conserved (55% and 77%
of constant positions, respectively) and the saturation
plot indicates that they are slightly saturated (slopes of
0.19 and 0.89 respectively, Additional file 2, Figure S1).
Although third codon positions evolved more rapidly
and are thus more saturated (20% of constant sites,
slope of 0.09, Additional file 2, Figure S1), another standard test for saturation (PAUP 4.0 [38], partition-homogeneity test by codon position) indicated that they are
not significantly more saturated than the first and second codon positions (p = 1).
The nucleotide data set had a 74% A+T content and
was compositionally homogeneous (p = 0.83, PAUP c2
test of compositional homogeneity across taxa). However,
the amount of A+T and the compositional homogeneity
differed strikingly depending on the codon position. First
and second codon positions displayed relatively low A+T
contents (68% and 64% respectively) and were homogeneous (p = 1, PAUP c2 test of compositional homogeneity across taxa). In contrast, third codon positions had a
high A+T content (89%) and were compositionally heterogeneous (p = 0, PAUP c2 test of compositional homogeneity across taxa). This difference in composition
between codon positions suggests that the typical drift of
Haemosporidian species toward A+T richness was negatively selected at first and second codon positions and
less constrained at third positions, most likely due to
constraints at the protein level.
Standard phylogenetic analyses

Phylogenetic reconstructions in this section were
obtained with the most widely used models, which have
both maximum-likelihood (ML) and Bayesian implementations. MrAIC [39] estimated that, among 56 models of nucleotide substitution, the best AIC score [40]
was achieved by the most general homogeneous and
reversible model (GTR, “general time reversible” [41]),
combined with four discrete gamma categories of “rates
across sites” [42], plus an additional rate category for
invariant sites (model GTRnt + Γ4 + I, where subscript
nt stands for nucleotides). This model was also selected
by MrAIC with individual codon positions. We used the
PhyloBayes 3.0 software [43] for Bayesian analyses,
which does not implement the invariant rate category.
Bayesian analyses of nucleotide alignments were thus
performed under the GTRnt + Γ4 model.
ML and Bayesian analyses of the nucleotide data set
under GTRnt + Γ4 + I and GTRnt + Γ4 models, respectively, strongly supported a clade containing the 20
mammal infecting Plasmodium species (Figure 2)
[6,20-25,27,28,36]. The mammal malaria parasite clade
comprises three strongly supported main lineages. One
lineage is specialized in infecting great ape hosts and

Page 3 of 15

includes P. falciparum, P. reichenowi and P. gaboni
[25-28]. The second lineage is characterized by African
and Asian primate hosts and comprises 14 Plasmodium
species [11]. The third lineage includes P. berghei,
P. yoelii and P. chabaudi, the African rodent malaria
parasites [37]. Most interestingly, the two lineages of
great ape and rodent parasites clustered together with
strong posterior probability (PP = 0.99, Figure 2). ML
analysis also yielded significant support for this clade
(Shimodaira-Hasegawa-like support SH = 0.93, bootstrap
support BS = 0.82, Table 1).
First and second codon positions, and third codon
positions were analyzed separately, using the same models of nucleotide evolution as previously. Both data sets
supported, although weakly, a clade containing great ape
and rodent malaria parasites, hereafter denoted “monophyly of great ape and rodent parasites” (Additional file
3, Table S2, column “Rodent”).
Finally, ProtTest [44] determined that the best fit to the
amino-acid alignment was provided by the JTT + Γ4 + I +
F model [45]. We used the JTT + Γ4 model for the Bayesian analysis of the amino-acid alignment. The monophyly
of great ape and rodent parasites received weak SH and
bootstrap support (SH = 0.46, BS = 0.41), but relatively
high posterior probability (PP = 0.92, Table 1).
SH and BS supports are more conservative than posterior probabilities, which are generally expected to be
higher [46,47]. Moreover, given the high level of conservation of protein and individual codon position alignments (see above), the complete nucleotide alignment is
expected to provide more phylogenetic signal and higher
supports. Thus, all previous results are congruent, with
differing but explainable levels of confidence, and support a monophyly of great ape and rodent parasites.
Assessment of model violation and robustness to the
model choice

To evaluate the influence of potential model violations, we
used improved Bayesian models implemented in PhyloBayes 3.0 software [43]. The fits of these additional models
to the data were measured using cross-validated likelihood
(see Methods and Additional file 4, Table S3). Moreover,
we applied posterior predictive tests which measure the
model ability to accurately reproduce observed features of
the data (see Methods and Additional file 5, Table S4). In
this section, we only comment on experiments where posterior predictive tests were not rejected (i.e. there was significant violation of model assumptions). In this case, we
conclude that a specific feature of the data is correctly
anticipated by the model assumptions.
We wanted to evaluate the potential effects of site
saturation on our estimates. Site-heterogeneous mixture
models such as “CAT” [48] (see Methods) efficiently
deal with violations caused by high saturation levels

[48,49]. However, this model might lack resolution
power, especially in the case of small data sets [48]. In
addition, we wanted to measure the potential effect of
compositional biases on our estimates. Consequently, we
analyzed data sets under the time-heterogeneous model
“BP” [50,51], which is designed to deal with compositional heterogeneity across taxa (see Methods).
Saturation in the nucleotide alignment

Among the three additional models considered, CAT +
GTRnt + Γ 4 [43] (see Methods) yielded the best fit to

the nucleotide data set, and it outperformed GTRnt + Γ4
by 103 points of cross-validated likelihood (Additional
file 4, Table S3). Moreover, posterior predictive tests
showed that this model correctly anticipated the level of
saturation of the nucleotide data set (p > 0.28, Additional file 5, Table S4). This suggests that the CAT +
GTRnt + Γ4 model is not misled by site saturation. CAT
+ GTR nt + Γ 4 strongly supported the monophyly of
great ape and rodent parasites, considering either all

(see Additional file 6, Figure S2), or third codon positions (PP = 0.92 and PP = 0.65 respectively, Additional
file 3, Table S2).
Compositional heterogeneity in the nucleotide alignment

Third codon positions were compositionally heterogeneous (see above c2 tests), and they carried 54% of variable sites. Hence, potential convergence of sequence
compositions could have misled the previously used
time-homogeneous models [50-52]. Interestingly, posterior predictive tests showed that the compositional
heterogeneity across taxa of first and second codon
positions was correctly anticipated under the timehomogeneous models GTRnt + Γ4 and CAT + GTRnt +
Γ4 (p > 0.44, Additional file 5, Table S4), suggesting that
these models are relatively robust to compositional
changes in this data set.
The time-heterogeneous model GTRnt + BP + Γ4 [50]
(see Methods) explicitly accounts for variations in composition across taxa. It correctly anticipated the
observed compositional heterogeneity, considering either
all, first and second, and third codon positions (p >
0.11, Additional file 5, Table S4), suggesting that this
model is unlikely to be misled by compositional heterogeneity across taxa. The monophyly of great ape and
rodent parasites was strongly supported under the
GTR nt + BP + Γ 4 model, considering either all codon
positions (PP = 0.95, Table 1), first and second, or third
codon positions (PP = 0.99 and PP = 0.72 respectively,
Additional file 3, Table S2).
Model violations in the amino-acid alignment

According to the analysis of the amino-acid data set,
methodological bias may arise from the use of the universal replacement model JTT. The peculiar A+T rich
composition of Haemosporidian genes could lead to
slightly different estimations for the exchange rate parameters and hence alter the probability of clustering

great ape and rodent parasites together. Accordingly, we
used the GTRaa model (where subscript aa stands for
amino acids) which does not rely on a pre-estimated
replacement matrix like JTT. The GTR aa + Γ 4 model
strongly supported the monophyly of great ape and
rodent parasites (PP = 0.98, Table 1).
Cross-validations indicated that, among the 12 alternative models, the site-heterogeneous model CAT + JTT +
Γ 4 [43] (see Methods) provided the best fit to the
amino-acid data set (Additional file 4, Table S3).
According to posterior predictive tests, this model correctly anticipated the saturation level observed in the
data (p > 0.07, Additional file 5, Table S4). Moreover,
the site- and time- heterogeneous model CAT + BP +
Γ4 [51] (see Methods) correctly anticipated the level of
saturation of the amino-acid data set (p = 0.41). However, the posterior predictive test for compositional heterogeneity across taxa was rejected under CAT + BP +
Γ4 (p = 0.02), although as expected, this model anticipated compositional heterogeneity better than do timehomogeneous models (p = 0.001, Additional file 5,
Table S4). Both the two last models moderately supported the monophyly of rodent and great ape parasites
(PP = 0.80 and PP = 0.75 under CAT + JTT + Γ4 and
CAT + BP + Γ4 respectively, Table 1). In both cases, few
variable amino-acid positions are interpreted under
highly parameter rich models, and moderate support is
therefore to be expected.
Most importantly, all results in this section are congruent with our initial estimate. This suggests that measured
model violations do not significantly bias the relationship
of great ape parasites among mammal parasites. In other
words, the monophyly of great ape and rodent parasites
appears to be robust to the choice of the model, as well
as to its assumptions and dimensionality.
Robustness to taxon sampling

To avoid possible biases resulting from an ad hoc set of
sequences, it is important to assess the robustness of
this phylogenetic association with respect to taxon selection, which was achieved by analyses of 30 different
taxonomic samples. Among previously considered data
sets, the complete nucleotide data set had the highest
number of variable positions to interpret (1627), and
our experiments showed that it is unlikely to induce
strong model violation, whatever the phylogenetic
model considered. Hence, in the following sections, we
present phylogenetic analyses of complete nucleotide
alignments performed under models GTR nt + Γ 4 + I
(ML) and GTRnt + Γ4 (Bayesian inference).
Robustness to taxon removal

First, we checked the influence on phylogenetic reconstructions of the selected great ape parasites. According
to the initial taxon selection, this lineage includes

Blanquart and Gascuel BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:70
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/70

P. falciparum, P. reichenowi and P. gaboni. Six additional combinations of these three taxa were devised
(see Methods). The weakest (but still relatively high)
support for the monophyly of great ape and rodent
parasites was obtained when P. reichenowi was considered as the only representative of its lineage (PP = 0.93,
SH = 0.78, BS = 0.68, Additional file 7, Table S5). Second, we devised six combinations of the three rodent
parasites, P. berghei, P. yoelii and P. chabaudi. The data
set with P. berghei as the only representative of its lineage yielded the weakest support for the monophyly of
great ape and rodent parasites (PP = 0.56, BS = 0.52,
Additional file 7, Table S5), and the ML tree weakly
supported the alternative hypothesis of a monophyly of
primate and rodent parasites (i.e. Figure 1B, SH = 0.05).
Third, six combinations of primate parasites were considered. Only the combination with African primate
parasites (P. gonderi and P. DAJ-2004) as the only representatives of their lineage supported the alternative
hypothesis of a monophyly of primate and rodent parasites (i.e. Figure 1B, PP = 0.85, SH = 0.26, BS = 0.48,
Additional file 7, Table S5). The five other combinations
of primate parasites supported the monophyly of great
ape and rodent parasites (PP > 0.96, SH > 0.60, BS >
0.71, Additional file 7, Table S5). Finally, we investigated
the robustness to the taxon composition of the outgroup
(i.e. mammal and saurian parasites were considered as
ingroup and outgroup, respectively). All six devised outgroups yielded high support for the monophyly of great
ape and rodent parasites (PP > 0.98, SH > 0.64, BS >
0.74, Additional file 7, Table S5).
Hence, with the exception of three taxonomic samples, in which (i) P. reichenowi, (ii) P. berghei and (iii) P.
gonderi and P. DAJ-2004 were considered as the only
representatives of their respective lineages, all other 21
combinations of taxa provided good support for the
association of great ape and rodent parasites (PP > 0.96,
SH > 0.60, BS > 0.71, Additional file 7, Table S5).
Robustness to taxon addition

First, (i) 8 CytB genes from great ape parasites, (ii) 10
pairs of CytB and Cox1 genes from rodent parasites
and, (iii) 27 pairs of CytB and Cox1 genes from Plasmodium species infecting a wide range of sauria hosts
(Additional file 8, Table S6) were added in turn to the
initial 33-taxon data set. The association of great ape
and rodent parasites was still strongly supported (PP >
0.99, SH > 0.77, BS > 0.78, Additional file 7, Table
S5), and the lineages of great ape, rodent, and mammal parasites were each still shown to be monophyletic (PP = 1).
Second, all previous taxa were analyzed together (33
taxa + 8 great ape + 10 rodent + 27 saurian parasites),
yielding a 78-taxon tree. The monophyly of great ape

Page 6 of 15

and rodent parasites was still strongly supported (PP =
0.99, SH = 0.86, BS = 0.76, Additional file 7, Table S5).
Third, we added six Hepatocystis species to the initial
33-taxon nucleotide data set. These six parasites were
monophyletic (PP = 1). They clustered within the clade
of mammal parasites, which was then composed of four
monophyletic main lineages. The monophyly of great ape
and rodent parasites was weakly supported (PP = 0.40,
SH = 0.05, BS = 0.38), but this low support was entirely
due to high uncertainty with respect to the position of
Hepatocystis within mammalian malaria parasites. Indeed,
Hepatocystis were located, with weak support, in five
positions on trees in which great ape and rodent parasites
were located close together (e.g. Hepatocystis as a sistergroup to great ape parasites: PP = 0.28, BS = 0.28, or to
rodent parasites: PP = 0.31, BS = 0.29). We evaluated
posterior and bootstrap support for the great ape being
close to, but not necessarily monophyletic with, rodent
parasites (i.e. the great ape plus rodent parasite lineage
could also include Hepatocystis). When support was
summed over the three possible positions of Hepatocystis
relative to the association of great ape and rodent parasites, then parasites of great apes and of rodents were
located close together with strong support (PP = 0.99
and BS = 0.87, Additional file 7, Table S5).
Fourth, the six Hepatocystis species were analyzed
simultaneously with all the previous 78 taxa, yielding an
84-taxon tree (Figure 3). A strict monophyly of great
ape and rodent parasites was weakly supported (PP =
0.28, SH = 0, BS = 0.31), due to high uncertainty with
respect to the position of Hepatocystis (e.g. Hepatocystis
as a sister-group to great ape parasites: PP = 0.36, BS =
0.25, or to rodent parasites: PP = 0.35, BS = 0.25). However, disregarding the exact position of Hepatocystis,
great ape and rodent parasites were located close
together with high support (PP = 0.99, BS = 0.75, Additional file 7, Table S5).
Thus, all six previous additions of mitochondrial genes
did not alter the result indicating a likely close phylogenetic relationship of great ape and rodent parasites.
Overall, statistical supports averaged over the 30 taxonomic samples considered in this section showed a
robust relationship of great ape and rodent parasites
(PP = 0.95, SH = 0.81, BS = 0.78) . This suggests that
this relationship does not depend solely on the selection
of the taxa we considered here. However, the uncertainty concerning the exact position of Hepatocystis species within mammal parasites challenges the above
mentioned monophyly of a clade only comprising parasites of great apes and of rodents, because it would be
possible for Hepatocystis to cluster within that clade.
Nonetheless, whatever the true position of Hepatocystis
may be, it does not contradict our main result indicating

Comparison with previous studies

In previous studies, the hypothesis of great ape parasites
being a sister-group to all other mammal parasites was
defended by analyses of mitochondrial genes
[6,21,22,24,27,35] or complete mitochondrial genomes
[24,25,28], of nuclear coding genes [53] and ribosomal
RNA [20], or by combining genes from nuclear and
mitochondrial genomes with genes from the apicoplast
genome [36]. Moreover, considering different rooting
assumptions breaking the monophyly of mammal parasites, this result was also obtained through analyses of
nuclear 18 S rRNA [11,18], nuclear genes [29,32,34] and
mitochondrial cytochrome b genes [21].
Most of these studies of the Haemosporidia phylogeny
relied on a single gene, and only a few taxa data sets,
which might lack phylogenetic signal [35]. In contrast,
two recent studies analyzed larger data sets. The first
study analyzed a large number of taxa (40), but few concatenated genes (4) [36], whereas the second focused on
a large number of genes (104), but considered very few
taxa (8) [53]. Next, we suggest possible reasons for the
disagreement between the results of these two studies
and ours.
Comparison with a taxa-wide phylogenetic analysis

As a general guideline, wider taxon sampling usually
helps to resolve phylogenies more accurately, provided
enough genes are available to overcome stochastic noise,
and are also sufficiently conserved to avoid systematic
errors [54]. In line with this idea, Martinsen et al. [36]
analyzed four concatenated genes for a relatively wide
sample of 40 taxa. Among the previous works, their
experimental conditions are thus the closest to ours.
But, intriguingly, our results do not confirm theirs. We
suggest that the disagreement between the two studies
is due to several factors, the first being the differences
in the phylogenetic markers analyzed.
Both Martinsen et al. [36] and our study considered
CytB and Cox1 mitochondrial genes. However, Martinsen et al. [36] additionally analyzed adenylosuccinate
lyase (ASL) and caseinolytic protease C (ClpC) genes,
whereas we analyzed the third mitochondrial gene Cox3.
In order to compare global rates of evolution between
these genes, we measured the total lengths of gene trees
[55], for a common sub set of eight taxa (P. falciparum,
P. reichenowi, P. vivax, P. knowlesi, P. berghei, P. chabaudi, P yoelii and P. gallinaceum). Our values indicate
that the ASL genes evolved 3 to 5 times faster than the
slowest evolving genes: ClpC, Cox1 and Cox3 (Figure 4).

that great ape parasites are unlikely to be a sister-group
to all other mammal parasites [6,20-22,24,25,27,28,36]
(Figure 1B), but instead, probably share a more recent
common ancestor with rodent parasites [23,27] (Figure

P yoelii and P. gallinaceum. Vertical lines: lengths of 8-taxa trees for
CytB, Cox3 and Cox1 mitochondrial genes, and of 7-taxa trees, for

of lengths of 8-taxa trees over the 104 orthologous nuclear genes
of Dávalos and Perkins [53].

The signal to noise ratio is expected to be higher for
slowly evolving phylogenetic markers, and fast rates of
evolution generally reduce the accuracy of inferred phylogenetic trees [49,56]. In addition, we considered ASL
and ClpC genes of 18 and 27 taxa respectively, for taxonomic samples as close as possible to our originally
selected 33 taxa (Additional file 9, Table S7). The
rapidly evolving gene, ASL, did not support a monophyly of mammal parasites, suggesting strong systematic
errors (Additional file 10, Figure S3). In contrast, the
slow evolving gene, ClpC, supported this monophyly (PP
= 0.99, SH = 0.94, BS = 0.51), but did not support any
particular position of P. falciparum within mammal
parasites (Additional file 11, Figure S4). However, a
recent study of 14 ClpC genes supported a common
ancestry of great ape and rodent parasites [57].
Moreover, most CytB, ClpC and ASL sequences analyzed by Martinsen et al. [36] were partial CDS. Thus,
even considering four genes, their alignment covered
2334 nucleotide sites, representing 70% of the 3308
nucleotide sites considered in the present study. Finally,
they considered fewer mammalian malaria parasites
than we did (11 taxa in the study of Martinsen et al.
[36], versus 20 to 44 taxa in our work), and they considered P. falciparum as the only representative of the lineage of great ape parasites, together with P. vivax and P.
knowlesi as the only representatives of primate parasites.
All these differences in experimental conditions (i.e.
saturation of ASL gene, fewer sites, fewer mammal

parasites close to P. falciparum) could together contribute to the difference between the results of Martinsen
et al. [36] and ours.
Comparison with a genome-wide phylogenetic analysis

Dávalos and Perkins [53] extracted a set of 104 putative
orthologous nuclear genes from the eight complete genomes of Plasmodium species sequenced to date (P. falciparum, P. reichenowi, P. vivax, P. knowlesi, P. berghei, P.
chabaudi, P yoelii and P. gallinaceum). Their phylogenetic analyses of individual genes displayed discrepancies
with respect to the inferred trees. Approximately half
the 104 genes supported a monophyly of primate and
rodent parasites (Figure 1B) [6,20-22,24,25,27,28,36].
Alternative hypotheses of a monophyly of great ape and
primate parasites (Figure 1C) [14], and of great ape and
rodent parasites (Figure 1D) [23,27], were each supported by nearly a quarter of these 104 genes. Interestingly, for the same reduced sample of eight taxa, our
phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial genes, taken
separately, displayed comparable discrepancies (Table 2).
Moreover, the supports obtained showed a near-random
resolution of the internal branch of the 8-taxon individual gene trees. This suggests that, rather than showing
a global preference of individual genes for the monophyly of primate and rodent parasites, the analysis of
individual genes by Dávalos and Perkins [53] might have
been strongly influenced by stochastic noise.
Increasing the amount of signal by concatenating
genes helps to alleviate the effects of stochastic noise.
The analysis of the three concatenated mitochondrial
genes, for the eight taxa, supported the monophyly of
great ape and rodent parasites (PP = 0.97, SH = 0.58, BS
= 0.65; Table 2). In contrast, the concatenation of the
104 nuclear genes yielded strong support for the monophyly of primate and rodent parasites [53] (Figure 1B).
We estimated the total tree lengths of each of these

104 genes, as well as of their concatenation. First,
mitochondrial genes evolved as slowly as the 1 fraction
3
of the 104 nuclear genes which displayed the slowest
rate of evolution (Figure 4). Second, total tree length
estimated for the 104 gene concatenation indicated a
fast average rate of evolution, about two times faster
than that of the three mitochondrial genes. These observations confirm the fact that mitochondrial genes
are well conserved, and corroborate the conclusion of
Dávalos and Perkins [53] indicating that most of their
104 genes are highly saturated and evolved relatively
fast. Thus, the monophyly of primate and rodent parasites (Figure 1B), obtained by the latter authors from a
large concatenation of 104 genes, most likely results
from systematic errors that may be due to the high
saturation level of most genes [53,58], but also presumably to the small sample of only eight taxa [54].
Comparison with two corroborated studies

In contrast, our results support a common origin of
great ape and rodent parasites (Figure 1D). This corroborates results of a recent study published by Perkins
[23] who, to the best of our knowledge, was the first to
mention this hypothesis. This author sequenced seven
new mitochondrial genomes and reconstructed the phylogeny of a sample of 24 taxa. A similar phylogeny was
also obtained from 38 partial CytB sequences [27]. However, the two previous studies did not discuss the
robustness of this result, but instead suggested it should
be considered with caution [23,27], as most previous
studies of mitochondrial genes supported a monophyly
of primate and rodent parasites (Figure 1B) [6,21,22,24,
24,25,27,28,35].
However, in our results, this hypothesis never
obtained significant statistical support: at most, it
reached PP = 0.35 and BS = 0.57 with the 33-taxon
amino-acid alignment (Additional file 3, Table S2,

column “Primate+Rodent”), and it obtained averaged
supports of PP = 0.05, SH = 0.01 and BS = 0.20 over
the 30 additional taxon samples considered (Additional
file 7, Table S5, column “Primate+Rodent”).
Interestingly, each time the monophyly of great ape
and rodent parasites (Figure 1D) was not significantly
supported, the only alternative hypothesis which could
not be statistically rejected was the monophyly of primate and rodent parasites (i.e. support for “Primate
+Rodent” in Additional files 3 and 7, Tables S2 and S5,
where PP > 0.05). Moreover, nine additional samples of
19 taxa were drawn so that trees would display long
branches, and we obtained five trees in which great ape
parasites were shown to be a sister-group to primate
and rodent parasites (Additional file 12, Table S8). This
suggests that the monophyly of primate and rodent
parasites (Figure 1B), rather than the monophyly of
great ape and rodent parasites (Figure 1D), might result
from the effect of long branch attraction. Thus, the
slight tendency of mitochondrial genes to weakly support a monophyly of primate and rodent parasites, along
with differences in taxon sampling and gene selection,
could explain the disagreements between our results
and most previous studies.

Conclusions
With special focus on the still unclear phylogenetic
position of great ape parasites, which include Plasmodium falciparum [25-28], in this study, we explored the
phylogeny of Haemosporidian species by analyzing their
mitochondrial genes. We showed that these genes have
evolved relatively slowly and are mostly compositionally
homogeneous, which characterizes them as potentially
accurate phylogenetic markers. Corroborating many
results obtained over the past few years, we obtained a
monophyly of mammalian malaria parasites. Within that
clade, we observed four main host-specialized lineages
of parasites: Plasmodium species infecting (i) primate,
(ii) rodent and (iii) great ape hosts, and (iv) Hepatocystis
species infecting bats and primates. The inferred relationships within host-specialized lineages of Plasmodium
parasites are congruent with the literature [11,26,37].
Hepatocystis species have received little attention to
date. According to our results, these parasites may have
diverged within mammalian malaria parasites, but their
exact origin remains unclear. Our results support a
common ancestry of great ape and rodent parasites (Figure 1D). We showed that this phylogenetic relationship
is robust to various experimental conditions, demonstrating that it is unlikely to arise from an artefact of
tree reconstruction.
Our study focused on mitochondrial genes. Nevertheless, it is still unclear if mitochondrial genomes match

Page 10 of 15

the Haemosporidian species tree or not [23]. This question could be answered by comparing the respective
phylogenies of the three genomes hosted by Haemosporidian species (i.e. phylogenies of the mitochondrial,
nuclear and apicoplast genomes). However, appropriate
data sets for phylogenetic reconstruction of nuclear and
apicoplast genomes are not yet available. A successful
strategy for resolving a gene- and taxa- wide phylogeny
would involve targeted sequencing of identified slowly
evolving genes from the apicoplast and nuclear genomes. Careful phylogenetic analyses of such new and
accurate phylogenetic markers will likely help to definitely resolve the phylogenetic origins of Plasmodium
falciparum and other great ape parasites.

Methods
Mitochondrial gene and protein alignments

Complete mitochondrial genomes of 33 Haemosporidian
parasites [22,23,25,59-66] were downloaded from the
NCBI website (Additional file 1, Table S1). Available
taxa included four Leucocytozoon species infecting birds
[23,66]. These parasites are the closest relatives of other
already identified Haemosporidia [6], and were used as
outgroups. We collected mitochondrial genomes of four
Haemoproteus and Parahaemoproteus species [23,62],
and of five Plasmodium species [22,23,62,65] infecting
saurian hosts (birds and reptiles). We collected a set of
20 mitochondrial genomes of mammal malaria parasites,
including those of three rodent [59], three great ape
[25,60,61] and 14 primate parasites [22,63,64].
Mitochondrial genomes of Haemosporidian species are
vestigial and have a typical length of 6, 000 base pairs
[67,68]. They form linear concatemers, each repeated
unit encoding fragments of ribosomal genes together
with three coding genes involved in the electron transport chain: cytochrome b and cytochrome oxidase subunits I and III (denoted as CytB, Cox1 and Cox3,
respectively). Both nucleotide coding sequences and
their translations into amino acids were retrieved
according to annotated CDS. No annotation of the
mitochondrial genes was available for Plasmodium relictum jb5, Parahaemoproteus jb1.JA27 and Parahaemoproteus jb2.SEW5141. In this case, gene sequences were
extracted manually and unambiguously, given the high
conservation level of start and end positions shared by
all 30 other annotated genes.
Nucleotide sequences were aligned using MACSE
(Ranwez V, Harispe S, Delsuc F, and Douzery EJP,
“MACSE: Multiple Alignment of Coding Sequences
accounting for frameshifts and stop codons”, manuscript
in preparation). This method computes the alignment of
coding nucleotide sequences with respect to their possible translations. It attempts to minimize the occurrence

Blanquart and Gascuel BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:70
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/70

of frameshifts and stop codons. We applied the relevant
codon table, as indicated on the NCBI website [69].
MACSE identified and corrected three long frameshifts
in the Cox3 gene of P. berghei, and in CytB genes of
Ha. columbae and L. caulleryi. These frameshifts
resulted in erroneous translations of the corresponding
publically available amino-acid sequences. Consequently,
we used the translated alignment computed by MACSE,
rather than the alignment of the official NCBI translations. Individual gene and protein alignments were filtered with Gblocks 0.91 [70], and allowing a maximum
of half gap states per site (option -b5 = h). Filtered
alignments of nucleotide and amino-acid sequences
were finally concatenated. This yielded two concatenations, one of 3308 nucleotide sites (number of nucleotide sites for CytB: 1125, Cox1: 1434, Cox3: 749), and
one of 1099 amino-acid positions. The assembled data
sets are available at the following URL: http://www.

Phylogenetic inferences
Description of phylogenetic models

Data sets were analyzed under various probabilistic models of molecular evolution. We applied the JTT [45]
replacement model to the amino-acid data set. We
applied the most general time reversible model GTRnt,
where subscript nt denotes nucleotides, to the nucleotide
data sets [41]. These substitution models were run using
both maximum-likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference
(BI) methods. This allowed for the use of different statistical supports with different meanings, and comparison of
the phylogenies estimated with the two approaches.
ML phylogenetic reconstructions were performed
using PhyML 3.0 [47]. Irrespective of the substitution
model (GTRnt, JTT) used for the analysis, the phylogenetic model additionally involved four discrete categories of gamma distributed rates across sites (denoted
+ Γ4, [42]), plus an invariant site category (denoted +I).
The proportion of invariant sites and the shape parameter of the gamma distribution were estimated from
the data. When the nucleotide data sets were analyzed,
all eight free parameters of the GTRnt substitution models were estimated from the data (GTRnt + Γ 4 + I, 10
degrees of freedom). In the case of the amino-acid alignment analyzed under JTT, stationary probabilities were
set to empirical frequencies of amino acids measured
over the whole data set (JTT + Γ4 + I + F, 21 degrees of
freedom). Note that these models were identified as the
available ML models that best fit the sequence alignments, according to the AIC criterion [40].
Bayesian phylogenetic reconstructions were performed
using PhyloBayes 3.0 [43]. For all Bayesian experiments
performed in this study, two independent MCMC chains
- each starting from a random point - were run for up

Page 11 of 15

to 100, 000 cycles. One MCMC sample was saved every
10 cycles, and the first 500 samples were discarded as
“burnin”. The eight free parameters of GTRnt and the
amino-acid frequencies of JTT (19 free parameters),
were estimated from the data.
We also applied more general and parameter rich
models of evolution, implemented in a Bayesian framework. We used GTR aa , where subscript aa indicates
a GTR model dedicated to amino-acid sequences. This
model directly estimates the exchange rate parameters
from the data (208 degrees of freedom). Models JTT
and GTRaa homogeneously apply a single substitution
model to the whole data set. However, in some cases,
this parameterization is prone to violations by the data,
resulting in wrong phylogenetic inferences [51]. Consequently, we applied the site-heterogeneous mixture
model CAT to the amino-acid alignment, which implements a mixture of stationary probability vectors across
sites [48]. The CAT model was combined with free
(+GTRnt ) or empirical (+JTT) relative exchange rates,
applied to the nucleotide and amino-acid alignments,
respectively. Both CAT + GTRnt and CAT + JTT models
were combined with discretized gamma rates across
sites (+ Γ 4 ). Finally, we analyzed both nucleotide and
amino-acid alignments under time-heterogeneous models of evolution. The BP model component allows for
changes over time of the substitution model stationary
probabilities and hence, estimates the compositional
drift of the sequences [50]. We applied the GTRnt + BP
+ Γ 4 [50] and the CAT + BP + Γ 4 [51] models to the
nucleotide and the amino-acid alignments, respectively.
Additional models with Bayesian implementations
were compared using cross-validation (see below). In
addition to the + Γ4 model of rate variation across sites,
we applied a covarion model (+COV) which enabled us
to estimate site specific rate variations (i.e. heterotachy)
[71]. In addition to JTT and GTRaa, we considered the
MtREV [72] empirical rate matrix. Finally, in addition to
the mixture model CAT, we considered the empirical
mixture models UL2 and UL3 [73]. These components
allowed 13 and 3 models of evolution to be derived and
applied to amino-acid and nucleotide alignments,
respectively.
Cross-validation experiments

The fit of the models implemented in a Bayesian framework was estimated by cross-validation, as implemented
in PhyloBayes 3.0 [43]. Ten replicate data sets were randomly drawn. The learning part of each replicate data set
comprised 90% of the sites of the whole alignment. The
10% of remaining sites were used to compute the crossvalidated likelihood. The tree topology was considered as
a free parameter. Note that, for computational reasons,
fits of time-heterogeneous models GTRnt + BP + Γ4 and
CAT + BP + Γ4 were not evaluated.

Posterior predictive experiments

Taxon sampling

Model violations were measured by posterior predictive
experiments, as implemented in PhyloBayes 3.0 [43]. We
applied a test statistic measuring the compositional heterogeneity across taxa. The test statistic “composition”
was defined as the maximum of the c2 distances separating each sequence composition from the composition of
the whole data set [52]. We applied two test statistics to
measure site saturation. The test statistic “site diversity”
measures the mean state diversity across sites [48] (e.g. a
constant site has a diversity of 1). The test statistic
“homoplasy” considers the averaged number of convergence and reversion events per site, as displayed by
inferred stochastic mapping [49]. A posterior predictive
test compares the value VO of a test statistic measured
given the observed data, to the distribution of that test
statistic measured over simulated replicate data sets. Each
replicate data set was simulated given an a posteriori
drawn sample of parameters. The p-value indicates the
probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as VO,
under the null hypothesis stating that the model assumptions are true. Failure to reject a posterior predictive test
indicates that the model assumptions allow to realistically
reproduce the observation VO based on real data.

Let A and B each be a monophyletic lineage within a
phylogenetic tree, and let them form a well-supported
monophyletic clade A + B according to an initial sample
of taxa. To ensure that the target relationship between
A and B does not result from stochastic noise (lack of
signal) or systematic error (model violation), we checked
its robustness to taxon sampling (e.g. [49]). Given a lineage C (possibly equal to A or B) including k taxa, we
checked that every combination of 1 to k - 1 taxa of C
yielded a congruent phylogeny with respect to the phylogenetic relationship A + B. If lineage C was composed
of too many taxa, we selected only a few relevant taxon
combinations among all those available.
We focused on the robustness of the association of lineage A: great ape parasites, with lineage B: rodent parasites.
Each of these two lineages was considered in turn as a
sampled lineage C. According to our initial selection of 33
taxa, both these lineages were composed of 3 taxa and, 6
combinations of single or pairs of representatives were
considered. We also considered in turn the group of primate parasites (14 taxa) and the saurian parasite outgroup
(13 taxa) as sampled lineages C. For each of these sampled
lineages, only 6 combinations of single or pairs of subgroups were considered. For the 14 primate parasites, the
3 sub-groups were: (a) P. malariae and P. ovale (infecting
humans), (b) P. gonderi and P. DAJ-2004 (African primate
parasites), and (c) 10 Plasmodium species infecting Asian
primates (Additional file 1, Table S1). For the 13 saurian
parasites, the 3 sub-groups were (a) the 5 Plasmodium
species, (b) the 4 Haemoproteus and Parahaemoproteus
species, and (c) the 4 Leucocytozoon species (Additional
file 1, Table S1). All these 24 sub data sets were obtained
from the nucleotide alignment by simply discarding the
relevant sequences without renewed aligning.
Finally, up to 51 malaria parasites were added to the
initial selection of 33 taxa. We aligned all 84 taxa following the alignment procedure described above. Note
that for CytB, 38 of the 51 additional sequences were
partial CDS (see Additional file 8, Table S6). In order to
retain more sites, complete and partial CytB genes were
filtered separately with Gblocks, and then manually reassembled into an 84-gene alignment. All 6 additions of
taxa to the 33-taxon data set were obtained from the
whole concatenation of genes of the 84 taxa by discarding the relevant sequences.

Saturation plot

Saturation of the phylogenetic signal of each codon position was illustrated by a saturation plot [74]. For each pair
of taxa in an alignment, we plotted their “pairwise similarity distance” (i.e. y-coordinates: number of sites displaying
different states, normalized by the alignment length), versus the distance separating these two taxa along the tree
branches (i.e. x-coordinates: the sum of branch lengths
from the two taxa to their common ancestor). We used a
fixed tree topology estimated from all codon positions
(Figure 2). Branch lengths and other model parameters
were evaluated according to separate codon positions.
Estimation of tree node supports

Under ML analysis, statistical support of tree branches
was estimated from 1000 bootstrap replicates and, in
addition, using the Shimodaira-Hasegawa-like test (SH)
implemented in PhyML 3.0 [47,75]. Bayesian analysis
classically provides a collection of samples drawn from
the a posteriori distribution. The posterior probability of
observing a given phylogenetic association between two
lineages is then approximated by its frequency among
sampled trees. Given a monophyletic target lineage A (e.
g. great ape parasites), we extracted from a tree collection the list of all its N different sister-groups Bn (e.g.
rodent parasites). We then computed the frequency
PA+Bn : the posterior support of clade A + Bn (e.g. great
ape plus rodent parasites). The same approach was used
for the bootstrap support, but not for the SH support
which applies only to clades that belong to the ML tree.
