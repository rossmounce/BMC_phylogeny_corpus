Strong functional patterns in the evolution of
eukaryotic genomes revealed by the
reconstruction of ancestral protein domain
repertoires
Christian M Zmasek, Adam Godzik*

Abstract
Background: Genome size and complexity, as measured by the number of genes or protein domains, is
remarkably similar in most extant eukaryotes and generally exhibits no correlation with their morphological
complexity. Underlying trends in the evolution of the functional content and capabilities of different eukaryotic
genomes might be hidden by simultaneous gains and losses of genes.
Results: We reconstructed the domain repertoires of putative ancestral species at major divergence points,
including the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA). We show that, surprisingly, during eukaryotic evolution
domain losses in general outnumber domain gains. Only at the base of the animal and the vertebrate sub-trees do
domain gains outnumber domain losses. The observed gain/loss balance has a distinct functional bias, most
strikingly seen during animal evolution, where most of the gains represent domains involved in regulation and
most of the losses represent domains with metabolic functions. This trend is so consistent that clustering of
genomes according to their functional profiles results in an organization similar to the tree of life. Furthermore, our
results indicate that metabolic functions lost during animal evolution are likely being replaced by the metabolic
capabilities of symbiotic organisms such as gut microbes.
Conclusions: While protein domain gains and losses are common throughout eukaryote evolution, losses
oftentimes outweigh gains and lead to significant differences in functional profiles. Results presented here provide
additional arguments for a complex last eukaryotic common ancestor, but also show a general trend of losses in
metabolic capabilities and gain in regulatory complexity during the rise of animals.

Background
Eukaryotic organisms exhibit an enormous diversity on
many different levels [1]. Besides vast variance in size,
appearance, ecology, and behavior, they also display
massive variation in their morphological and behavioral
complexity, ranging from unicellular protists to basal
animals, such as Trichoplax adhaerens with no internal
organs and only four different cell types [2] to mammals
with multiple internal organs, a complex nervous system, and around 210 different cell types [3,4]. Yet, the
number of protein coding genes present in eukaryotic

Research Institute, 10901 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA

genomes remains remarkably constant and does not
appear to correlate with perceived morphological and
behavioral complexity. For example, the human genome
is estimated to be composed of around 20,500 protein
coding genes [5], whereas the simple roundworm
Caenorhabditis elegans possesses about 19,000 protein
coding genes [6], and the morphologically more complex fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has a genome of
only about 14,000 genes [7]. In order to explain this so
called ‘gene-number paradox’ [8], numerous hypotheses
have been put forward. For instance, dramatic differences in morphological complexity, given relatively similar numbers of protein coding genes, have been
explained with an increasing role of non-coding RNA
transcription (for example, [8,9]), alternative splicing

[10], transposable elements [11], detailed transcriptional
control enabling a tight temporal and spatial control of
gene expression [12], the complexity of domain organization of proteins [13,14], and expansion of select gene
families [15,16].
While biologists have long been enthralled by the vast
diversity found amongst modern eukaryotes, the underlying evolutionary history that led to this vast diversity
is at least equally fascinating and is likely to help our
understanding of extant organisms and their molecular
biology. An intuitive view of eukaryote evolution is that
the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) was ‘simple’ and that accretion of features over time led to complex, multicellular organisms, such as plants and
animals. Recently, an increasing number of studies are
surfacing that suggest that many aspects of the LECA
might not have been ‘simple’ and that it probably
already had many features commonly associated with
modern eukaryotes [17]. For example, recent work suggests that the LECA already had an endomembrane system with near modern complexity (reviewed in [18]), as
well as a complex cell division machinery [19]. Numerous studies show that the LECA also had a relatively
large number of genes and that gene loss is a likely a
significant contributor to the composition of modern
genomes [16,20-22].
A succinct way to describe the functional potential of
large groups of genes, such as complete genomes or
metagenomes, is to list and analyze the set of recognized
domains present in proteins encoded by the genes in a
given group. Recently, a term ‘domainome’ was proposed for such sets [23]. Protein domains are minimal
structural and evolutionary units in proteins, retaining
their structure and usually their function even when
being part of proteins with different domain architectures [24]. Information about recognized protein
domains is collected in public resources such as Pfam
[25] or InterPro [26], which also provide information
about functions of individual domains (if available), both
in the form of short narratives as well as mappings into
formalized functional classifications, such as the gene
ontology (GO) [27].
In this work, we investigate the evolution of the
domain repertoires of eukaryotic genomes. To gain a
more complete picture of this evolution, we reconstruct the domainomes of ancestral species at important branching points of the eukaryotic tree of life,
such as the LECA and the Urbilateria (the last common ancestor of protostome and deuterostome animals). While parts of putative genomes for relatively
recent ancestral species have been reconstructed successfully (such as for the ancestor of placental mammals [28]; reviewed in [29]), due to vastly greater
evolutionary distances and such effects as domain

shuffling, we chose to reconstruct ancestral protein
domain sets (domainomes) as opposed to complete
sets of genes or entire genomes.

Results
Protein domain composition of extant and ancestral
genomes

We analyzed complete sets of predicted proteins for
114 eukaryotic genomes, including 73 from opisthokonta (38 metazoa, 1 choanoflagellate, and 34 fungi), 3
from amoebozoa, 17 from archaeplastida, 16 from
chromalveolata, and 5 from excavate, thus covering 5
of the 6 eukaryotic ‘supergroups’ [30,31] (we were
unable to obtain any complete genomes for the ‘supergroup’ Rhizaria [32]), for the presence of protein
domains, as defined by Pfam [25] (Figure 1; Additional
file 1) The number of distinct protein domains varies
from roughly 2,000 in the free living unicellular ciliate
Paramecium tetraurelia to 3,140 in one of the simplest
multicellular animals, Trichoplax adhaerens, to about
4,240 in humans (Figure 2c; for detailed counts see
Additional files 2, 3, and 4). These numbers follow the
expected trend of genomes of more complex organisms
containing more domains; however, they include many
apparent contradictions where more morphologically
complex organisms contain fewer domains than less
complex ones. To understand the evolutionary history
of the observed domain distribution in extant species,
we reconstructed the domain content of ancestral genomes, specifically those lying at internal nodes corresponding to major branching points in the evolution of
eukaryotes. Since independent evolution of the same
domain more than once is highly unlikely, we used
Dollo parsimony, which, when applied to domain content, states that each domain can be gained only once,
and seeks to minimize domain losses, to reconstruct
the Pfam domain repertoire of ancestral eukaryotes
[33-38] (Figure 2).
The evolution of most eukaryotic groups is dominated by
protein domain losses and not by domain gains

While the number of distinct domains found in extant
species shows a weakly growing trend (with outliers)
with the apparent morphological complexity (Figure 2c;
for detailed counts see Additional file 2), comparing
these numbers to those for the inferred ancestral genomes shows that the evolution of eukaryotes is defined
by a balance between domain losses and gains, with the
latter dominating at almost every branch of the tree of
life (Figure 2b; Additional files 3 and 4). Unexpectedly,
with a repertoire of about 4,400 distinct domains the
LECA already had a large domain repertoire, that is, larger than any of the currently existing species. The two
significant exceptions to this trend are the rise and early

evolution of multicellular animals, roughly 650 to 500
million years ago, and the origin of vertebrates, around
450 million years ago losses (divergence time estimates
are from [39]) - in these two cases domain gains significantly outnumber. Interestingly, the early evolution of
the two major groups of bilaterians, the deuterostomes
and protostomes are associated with a particularly high
number in lost domains (about 366 losses and 11 gains
for deuterostomes and 252 losses and 16 gains for
protostomes).
Less extensive domain losses in lophotrochozoans than in
ecdysozoans

Our results show that some lineages went through a
massive loss of domains. This phenomenon has been
noticed previously for ecdysozoans in general, and for
nematodes in particular [21,40-42]. In contrast, the
other major group of protostomes, the lophotrochozoans, went through a less extreme gene loss when compared to last common ancestor of deuterostomes and
protostomes (the Urbilateria). The domainome of the
lophotrochozoan ancestor, reconstructed from the
domainomes of three free living lophotrochozoans, two
annelids (the polychaete worm Capitella teleta and the
leech Helobdella robusta) and one mollusk (the snail
Lottia gigantea) is larger than that of ecdysozoans, and
the numbers of domains gained and lost relative to the
Urbilateria are smaller (Table 1). This further confirms
earlier speculation that lophotrochozoans are less
derived from the Urbilateria than ecdysozoans [41].
An unexpectedly large domainome in the sea anemone
Nematostella vectensis

Another striking finding is the comparatively large
domain repertoire of the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis (Starlet sea anemone) [43], especially relative to protostomes. Cnidarians are relatively simple in their
morphology, having around 10 cell types [4], compared
to protostomes, which are estimated to have between 30

and 50 distinct cell types [44]. This morphological simplicity of cnidarians clearly is not reflected in the genome content of N. vectensis, as its number of domains
(approximately 3,700) is comparable to that of lophotrochozoans and surpasses all ecdysozoans analyzed here.
This unexpected ‘genomic’ complexity (as opposed to
morphological complexity) of N. vectensis (and likely
other cnidarians as well) has also been noted on the
level of regulatory networks (for example, in [45,46]).
This is the best example illustrating a recurrent observation that the number of distinct protein domains is a
poor predictor for morphological complexity.
Functional consequences of domain gains and losses

As seen for the example of Nematostella and other outliers (Figure 2c; for detailed counts see Additional file 2),
numbers of distinct domains do not correlate with complexity amongst eukaryotes. A likely explanation for this
paradox may lie in the distribution of functions of
domains, rather than in their numbers. To make inferences about the functional aspect of domain gains and
losses, we defined functional profiles of domainomes by
assigning individual domains with functions from the GO
classification [27]. This allowed us to define a functional
profile for each extant and inferred ancestral domainome,
as well as for each set of gained and lost domains on
every branch of the eukaryote tree of life (for details see
the Materials and methods section). The first finding is
that the functional profiles of sets of domains lost and
gained at most branching points differ drastically: on the
path leading from the LECA to mammals, domains with
regulatory functions exhibit a net gain, while domains
with metabolic functions show a net loss (Table 2). This
effect is strongest for mammals and less pronounced for
other metazoans. In contrast, for all other groups of
eukaryotes, both regulatory domains and metabolic
domains show a net loss, although with the net loss for
regulatory domains being significantly smaller than that
for metabolic domains. For instance, during flowering

plant (Magnoliophyta) evolution, regulatory domains
show an average, per branch, net loss of 5.6, and metabolic domains exhibit a net loss of 18.8. For mushrooms
with complex fruiting bodies (homobasidiomycetes) [47],
these values are 9.3 for net losses of regulatory domains,
and 38.5 for net losses of metabolic domains.
Applying GO term enrichment analysis, as commonly
employed for microarray analysis [48], to the functions
of lost and gained domains enabled us to obtain a more
detailed view of the interplay between domain losses
and gains (Tables 3 and 4). Within an overall increase
in domains involved in regulation, our results show that
animal evolution on a genome level is specifically associated with enrichment of protein domains involved in
DNA-dependent transcriptional regulation, cell-matrix
adhesion, apoptosis (programmed cell death), signal
transduction (for example, G-protein coupled receptor
protein signaling, mitogen-activated protein kinase
kinase (MAPKK) activity), and various aspects of
immune system functions (in particular cytokine and
major histocompatibility complex-related domains).
While most of the enriched categories can be classified
as ‘regulatory’, some ‘metabolic’ categories are also
enriched. In particular, a number of domains involved
in mitochondrial electron transport appeared at the root
of the bilaterian tree, and domains involved in lipid
catabolic process appeared during the evolution of the
first chordates. On the other hand, domain losses during
animal evolution are predominantly associated with
amino acid biosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism.
The only exception to this trend is an unexpected loss

of numerous domains with functions in DNA-dependent
transcriptional regulation during the evolution of the
amniote ancestor. Figure 3 shows the effects of these
gains and losses on the composition of the ancestral
genomes during animal evolution (for lists of individual
domains and their corresponding GO terms, see Additional files 5 and 6). The most drastic changes occurred
around the rise of the first animals, whereas after the
appearance of the first tetrapods, changes on the functional level of the genome are minimal. Most categories
involved in regulation show an increase over time, with
most of the effect seen during the rise of the first animals, followed by a more gradual increase. In contrast,
categories involved in metabolism almost show a mirror
image, an accelerated loss during the evolution of the
first animals. The most drastic losses are in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. As expected, vitamin
and cofactor biosynthesis also show significant losses.
The only metabolic category that remains unchanged is
nucleotide metabolism.
Alternative topologies of eukaryotic tree of life

It is important to stress that all the calculations presented so far critically depend upon the exact topology
of the eukaryote evolutionary tree used for the parsimony based inference of ancestral domainomes. Additional files 7, 8, 9, and 10 show the results for different
models for the eukaryote tree, and are discussed below.
Classifying eukaryotes by the functional profiles of their
genomes reproduces the tree of life

Figure 4 shows a representation of the eukaryotic evolutionary tree in which the usual time and taxonomic axes
are replaced by axes representing the percentage of
domains involved in signal transduction and the percentage of domains with catalytic activity. Interestingly, this
results in a graph clearly separating most major groups
of eukaryotes. From this graph it is apparent that, on a
functional level, vertebrate genomes (shown in red), as
well as those of certain unicellular, chiefly parasitic,
organisms, especially Kinetoplastida (for example, the
sleeping sickness parasite Trypanosoma brucei) and

Percentage of domains involved in signal transduction

Figure 4 Classifying eukaryotes by the functional profiles of their genomes. A two-dimensional plot of regulatory function versus catalytic
activity percentages for ancestral and extant domainomes.

Metamonada (for example, the Giardiasis agent Giardia
lamblia) from the Excavata group [49] (shown in purple), and Aconoidasida (for example, the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum) from the Alveolata group
(shown in brown) are the most derived relative to the
LECA. On the other hand, this graph differs from the
eukaryotic evolutionary tree in that some groups that
are closely related appear quite distant, most strikingly
seen in the large separation between fungi and animals,
with fungi having the highest percentage in catalytic
activity and animals having among the lowest. It is also
noteworthy how similar all vertebrate genomes are to
each other on this level, despite roughly 400 million
years since the separation between ray-finned fish and
tetrapods [39], especially compared to the big ‘jumps’
between vertebrates and the deuterstome ancestor and
between the animal ancestor and the choanoflagellata/
animal ancestor.
Gut microbes complement human reduced metabolic
capacity

One of the interesting questions one may ask is how the
modern organisms compensate for the functionality of
protein domains that were ‘lost’ compared to their ancestors, especially among basic metabolic functions. An intriguing possibility is that some of this functionality may be

provided by symbiotic microbes. In a preliminary calculation we show that a ‘meta-organism’ containing a superset of protein domains found in the human genome and
in the genomes of the two common gut commensals,
Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Eubacterium rectale,
very closely resembles the LECA in its profile of metabolic domains (Additional file 11). Interestingly, none of
the known symbionts alone is able to provide such compensation, which agrees well with the observation that a
‘minimal functional gut microbiome’ consists of these
two bacteria [50].

Discussion
The results presented here indicate that although novel
domains do appear throughout eukaryote evolution, this
is offset, and usually overshadowed, by domain losses.
The weak trend of the increase of the number of
domains as a function of morphological complexity
appears to be a consequence of larger losses for some of
the morphologically simpler species. Overall, the number of distinct domains remains surprisingly constant
and varies between 3,500 and 4,000 for most branches
of the eukaryotic tree of life. It is important to remember that our estimates represents a lower bound for the
domain repertoire for both the ancestral and extant genomes, since our analysis does not take into account

Zmasek and Godzik Genome Biology 2011, 12:R4
http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/1/R4

extinct domains, domains not present or detected in any
of the analyzed genomes nor as yet unidentified
domains. Since the Pfam database does not yet cover
the complete protein domain universe (especially so for
domains specific to poorly studied organisms), at this
point covering around 60% of most eukaryotic genomes,
we expect the number of domain gains to grow with
more complete versions of Pfam. However, we don’t
expect this would reverse our findings presented here.
To test this, we compared the analysis presented here,
which uses the current version of Pfam (24.0) with over
10,000 domain models, with results obtained with previous versions of Pfam. While the overall number of
domains significantly increases with each release of
Pfam, often by >20% with each release, overall tendencies are independent of the Pfam version used (for
examples, see Additional file 12, which contains select
data from an analysis using Pfam version 22.0).
The minimal domain repertoire for a eukaryotic organism

The domain repertoires of the ciliates Paramecium tetraurelia and Tetrahymena thermophila, with about 2,080
and 2,190 distinct domains, respectively, while not the
smallest of the genomes analyzed here, are the smallest of
the free living organisms in this analysis, as all species with
smaller domain sets are primarily parasitic (such as the
cattle parasite Theileria parva, with of a domain repertoire
size of only about 860). Interestingly, while the domain
repertoire of P. tetraurelia is small, its gene number of
around 40,000 is very high. It has been shown that the
genome of P. tetraurelia is the result of at least three successive whole-genome duplications [51], explaining the
low number of distinct domains in a large genome, containing, presumably, a high degree of redundancy. Similarly, T. thermophila also has a high gene count, around
27,000, yet this seems to be due to numerous small duplication events, as opposed to whole genome duplications
[52]. It has also been found that T. thermophila shares
more orthologous genes with humans than are shared
between humans and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae
[52], despite fungi being phylogenetically closer to humans
than ciliates - another finding supporting a genomically
complex LECA and significant and lineage-specific loss of
genes, and thus domains, during eukaryote evolution.
Horizontal gene transfer

Horizontal gene transfer clearly has the potential to result
in misleadingly inflated domain counts of ancestral species. Despite being more common in eukaryotes than previously thought, most known cases of horizontal gene
transfer in eukaryotes involve bacteria as donors [53-55].
To avoid the possible effects of domains transferred from
prokaryotes to eukaryotes, we performed the reconstruction analysis under exclusion of bacterial and archaeal

Page 9 of 13

genomes. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility
that, especially for unicellular eukaryotes, a limited number of domains are present due to horizontal gene transfer.
For this reason we focused most of our subsequent functional analyses on multicellular animals, since we are not
aware of any reports showing gene transfer within animals.
Effects of the model of eukaryote evolution

Clearly, domain content of ancestral genomes and the
overall pattern of domain gains and losses are dependent on the details of the eukaryotic evolutionary tree
used for the Dollo parsimony based reconstruction.
There is an ongoing controversy concerning the details
of the phylogenetic tree of eukaryotes (for example,
[56]). In the results reported so far we have used a
newly emerging paradigm according to which eukaryotes can be classified into two larger clades, the unikonts and the bikonts [57]. However, in order to assess
the robustness of our results, we also performed all analyses with two alternative versions of the eukaryotic tree
of life. The results for the alternative trees are presented
in the additional material. The first one is a tree that
follows the unikonta/bikonta deep split but differs in the
animal sub-tree, where it follows the coelomata hypothesis instead of the more recent ecdysozoan hypothesis
(see the ‘coelomata’ tree in Additional files 7 and 9)
[58]. Interestingly, trees with an ecdysozoan clade consistently had a lower cost under Dollo parsimony than
more traditional topologies (with a cost of 73,363 for a
ecdysozoan model versus 74,433 for a coelomata
model), adding further support to the ecdysozoan
hypothesis. The second alternative tree, referred to in
the following as ‘crown group’, differs more significantly,
by essentially placing all protists outside of the plant/
animal/fungal subtree (see Additional files 8 and 10).
The domain gain and loss numbers based on the ‘coelomata’ tree do not show any significant differences from
the results presented in the main text: the origins of
deuterostomes and protostomes are still associated with
large losses and lophotrochozoans appear less derived
then arthropods and nematodes.
As expected, results based on the ‘crown group’ eukaryote tree appear to lead to strongly different domain
counts for the LECA (1,825, as opposed to 4,431). However, this result is based primarily on a clade of Metamonda, namely Giardia lamblia and Trichomonas
vaginalis, both human parasites, at the base of the tree.
Clearly these two parasites are highly derived and unlikely to exhibit much resemblance to the LECA [59].
Moving from the LECA towards metazoans, the domain
count for predicted ancestral species rapidly increases,
and as a soon as a tree includes at least one free living
species, the amoeba Naegleria gruberi, the domain
count of the ancestral eukaryote (2,801) approaches the

Zmasek and Godzik Genome Biology 2011, 12:R4
http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/1/R4

mean for extant nematodes (2,980). On the other hand,
while the topology of the eukaryote tree of life used
influences domain counts close to the root, it has no
significant effect on the results concerning the functional dynamics of eukaryote genomes during evolution.
Finally, we would like to point out that the model shown
in Figures 1 and 2 is controversial mainly due to uncertainty regarding the placement of Rhizaria. Since our analysis does not include any genomes from this group, this
controversy has no bearing on the results presented here.
The second controversy is regarding the placement of
haptophytes (a phylum of algae), which in the model used
here are considered part of Chromalveolata, but which
according to recent results might form a clade with
Archaeplastida [60]. In our analysis, haptophytes are
represented by only one genome, Emiliania huxleyi, the
placement of which on the tree of life has no measurable
effect on the results presented here (data not shown).
Further studies

Clearly, studies such as the one presented here will be
more accurate and informative once more eukaryote
genomes have been released covering the tree of life
more uniformly, since there is currently still a bias
towards commercially important species as well as traditional model organisms. For example, for animals, an
increased coverage of lophotrochozoans would be desirable. Improved sampling over species space is also
expected to go hand in hand with increased coverage of
domain space by Pfam and similar databases.

Conclusions
In this work we show that domain losses during eukaryote evolution are numerous and oftentimes outnumber domain gains. This, combined with estimates for
large numbers of domains present in ancestral genomes, is an additional argument for a complex LECA.
The functional profiles of gained and lost domains are
very different; for instance, during animal evolution
gained domains involved in regulatory functions are
enriched, whereas lost domains are preferentially
involved in metabolic functions, especially carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. This makes it seem
likely that animals over time outsourced a portion of
their metabolic needs. Clustering inferred ancestral
domainomes according to their functional profiles
results in graphs remarkably similar to the eukaryotic
tree of life.
Materials and methods
Protein predictions for 114 completely sequenced eukaryotic genomes were obtained from a variety of sources;
for details, as well as information regarding numbers of
protein predictions, see Additional file 1.

The domain repertoire for each genome was determined by hmmscan (with default options, except for an
E-value cutoff of 2.0 and ‘nobias’) from the HMMER
3.0b2 package [61] using hidden Markov models from
Pfam 24.0 [43]. In a second step, the hmmscan results
were filtered by the domain specific ‘gathering’ (GA)
cutoff scores provided by Pfam, followed by removal of
domains of obvious viral, phage, or transposon origin
(such as Pfam domain ‘Viral_helicase1’, a viral superfamily 1 RNA helicase). In case of overlapping domains,
only the domain with the lowest E-value was retained.
Based on these preprocessing steps, a list of domains
was created for each of the 114 genomes and, together
with each of the three eukaryotic evolutionary trees
described in the text, used for a Dollo parsimony [62]
based inference of ancestral domain repertoires. The
results of this step are lists of gained, lost, and present
domains for each ancestral species.
In order to assess the robustness of our results relative
to preprocessing steps, we also performed our analyses
with a variety of different parameter combinations, such
as uniform E-value based cutoffs ranging from 10 -4 to
10-18, as well as domain specific ‘noise’ (NC) and ‘trusted’
(TC) cutoff values from Pfam, with or without overlap
and/or viral domain removal. We were unable to find a
combination of these settings that would significantly
change the numbers presented here and invalidate our
conclusions. For example, Additional file 12 shows select
domain counts for a variety of cutoff values. While, as
expected, the absolute counts of domains are dependent
on the cutoff value(s) used, overall tendencies (such as
the LECA having an inferred domainome similar in size
to that of extant mammals, and significant domain losses
at the roots of deuterstome and ecdysozoa subtrees) are
independent of the cutoff values used. Additional file 13
shows detailed gain and loss numbers under a uniform
E-value-based cutoff of 10-8.
Pfam domains (lost, gained, and present) where
mapped to GO terms by using the ‘pfam2go’ mapping
(dated 2009/10/01) provided by the GO consortium [7].
GO term enrichment analysis for gained and lost
domains was performed using the Ontologizer 2.0 software [63] with the Topology-Elim algorithm [64], which
integrates the graph structure of the GO in testing for
group enrichment. Enrichments are calculated relative
to the union of all Pfam domains (with GO annotations)
present in all genomes analyzed in this work. As summarized in Additional file 14, we tested whether different calculation methods in the Ontologizer 2.0 software
(such as ‘Topology-Weighted’, ‘Parent-Child-Union’ or
‘Parent-Child-Intersection’ instead of ‘Topology-Elim’
[65]), as well as different approaches for multiple testing
correction, would lead to noticeable different conclusions regarding enriched GO categories at various points

Zmasek and Godzik Genome Biology 2011, 12:R4
http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/1/R4

during animal evolution. While the level of detail is
dependent on the calculation method used (for example,
‘Parent-Child-Union’ and ‘Parent-Child-Intersection’
methods in general lead to very broad terms, whereas
the other methods give more specific results), the results
for each setting show predominantly gains in regulatory
functions and losses in metabolic processes during animal evolution.
The preprocessing steps, the Dollo parsimony
approach, and basic ancestral GO term analyses, were
performed by software of our own design [66].
