Abstract
Background: Treatment of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection has been hampered by
the absence of a specific combination antiretroviral treatment (ART). Integrase strand transfer
inhibitors (INSTIs) are emerging as a promising new drug class for HIV-1 treatment, and we
evaluated the possibility of inhibiting FIV replication using INSTIs.
Methods: Phylogenetic analysis of lentiviral integrase (IN) sequences was carried out using the
PAUP* software. A theoretical three-dimensional structure of the FIV IN catalytic core domain
(CCD) was obtained by homology modeling based on a crystal structure of HIV-1 IN CCD. The
interaction of the transferred strand of viral DNA with the catalytic cavity of FIV IN was deduced
from a crystal structure of a structurally similar transposase complexed with transposable DNA.
Molecular docking simulations were conducted using a genetic algorithm (GOLD). Antiviral activity
was tested in feline lymphoblastoid MBM cells acutely infected with the FIV Petaluma strain.
Circular and total proviral DNA was quantified by real-time PCR.
Results: The calculated INSTI-binding sites were found to be nearly identical in FIV and HIV-1 IN
CCDs. The close similarity of primate and feline lentivirus IN CCDs was also supported by
phylogenetic analysis. In line with these bioinformatic analyses, FIV replication was efficiently
inhibited in acutely infected cell cultures by three investigational INSTIs, designed for HIV-1 and
belonging to different classes. Of note, the naphthyridine carboxamide INSTI, L-870,810 displayed
an EC50 in the low nanomolar range. Inhibition of FIV integration in situ was shown by real-time PCR

experiments that revealed accumulation of circular forms of FIV DNA within cells treated with L870,810.
Conclusion: We report a drug class (other than nucleosidic reverse transcriptase inhibitors) that
is capable of inhibiting FIV replication in vitro. The present study helped establish L-870,810, a
compound successfully tested in human clinical trials, as one of the most potent anti-FIV agents ever
tested in vitro. This finding may provide new avenues for treating FIV infection and contribute to
the development of a small animal model mimicking the effects of ART in humans.

Background
Animal models have been essential for preclinical testing
of antiretroviral strategies. Macaques infected with the
simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) chimera
are a well established model, which recently provided the
first proof of concept for an antiretroviral effect of integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) in vivo [1]. The
simian model can be used, however, only by institutions
able to support the high costs of primate facilities. Moreover, SHIV-infected macaques may represent an ethical
problem, and the obstacles to obtaining permission to
conduct research in primates have recently been intensified [2].
Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)-infected cats have
been proposed as an alternative/complementary animal
model for HIV-1/AIDS [3,4]. Cats are easier to house and
maintain, due to long adaptation to coexistence with
humans [5]. Moreover, easy access to naturally infected
animals could allow a better estimate of the impact of a
treatment on different circulating viral strains.
FIV is phylogenetically (though not antigenically) related
to HIV-1 [3]. Although vaccines designed for FIV cannot
directly be transferred to HIV-1, the feline model may find
an application in preliminarily testing the general validity
of an approach to vaccination [6], or to test the feasibility
of lentiviral eradication strategies.
A major limitation of the feline model is, however, the
absence of treatments mimicking the sustained effects of
combined antiretroviral therapies (ART) in humans. Similarly to HIV-1, FIV was shown to respond to nucleosidic
reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors (NRTIs) [7,8]. However, FIV is not inhibited by non-nucleosidic RT inhibitors
(NNRTIs) [8,9] and protease inhibitors (PIs) acting on
HIV-1 [8,10], although the latter drug class was found to
inhibit a wide range of non-HIV-1 targets [11-14]. The
absence of at least two drug classes inhibiting FIV hampered the possibility of using combination ART in the
feline model.
INSTIs represent a highly promising new drug class for
HIV-1/AIDS, and at least three such drugs have shown
potent antiretroviral effects in human clinical trials

[1,15,16]. The anti-HIV-1 potency of INSTIs at least equals
that of NNRTIs and PIs [1,15]. FIV IN was characterized in
the last decade [17,18]. Similar to HIV-1 IN, the FIV protein catalyzes 3' end processing, 3'end joining and disintegration of proviral DNA [17,18] (the biological
significance of the last of these reactions is as yet unknown
[1]). The reactions are absolutely dependent on divalent
cations, Mn++ or Mg++ [17]. The substrate specificity of FIV
IN is relaxed, and the protein was found to be active on
oligonucleotides containing sequences derived from the
U5 end of HIV-1 and murine leukemia virus (MLV) [17].
The enzyme structure of FIV IN is similar to that of HIV-1
IN; and it is organized in C- and N- terminal domains, and
a catalytic core domain (CCD). The C-terminal domain is
likely to be involved in target (i.e., cellular) DNA binding.
In contrast to what was reported for other retroviral INs,
deletion of the C-terminal domain does not abrogate the
catalytic activities of FIV IN, although the efficiency of the
3' processing and strand transfer reactions is decreased in
the truncated forms. Similar to other retroviral INs, FIV IN
is likely to act as a multimer [17]. At this time, the threedimensional (3D) structure of FIV IN is unknown, as is
the response of FIV to INSTIs. In the present paper, we
focus our attention on the CCD, because it is the protein
portion principally involved in binding of INSTI drugs to
proviral DNA/IN complexes, as shown in previous studies
on HIV-1 IN [1,19-22].
We here describe the first three-dimensional (3D) model
for FIV IN CCD, and show that the catalytic site of FIV IN
is nearly identical to that of the HIV-1 ortholog. Amino
acids calculated to be involved in drug binding are highly
conserved between HIV-1 and FIV INs. Moreover, INSTIs
inhibit FIV replication in cell cultures as efficiently as HIV1 replication. The possibility of targeting a second FIV
enzyme with antiretroviral drugs may provide a basis for
the design of an ART for FIV.

Results and discussion
Clustering of lentiviral enzymes
To determine which of the non-primate lentivirus IN
CCDs might have the closest similarity to the HIV-1 IN
CCD, a phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequences
of lentiviral IN CCDs was carried out. We chose to use
amino acid rather than nucleic acid sequences because
Page 2 of 13

Retrovirology 2007, 4:79

open-access databases do not report the IN CCD nucleic
acid sequences for some important members of the Lentivirus genus. Moreover, our phylogenetic analysis was
intended to analyze the similarities of the CCDs of the
mature lentiviral proteins, rather than to reconstruct a
phylogeny of the Lentivirus genus. We found that the IN
CCDs of feline lentiviruses are more closely related to
those of the HIV/SIV group than any other non-primate
lentiviral IN CCDs (Fig. 1). This result is supported by the
significant bootstrap values obtained (Fig. 1).

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/4/1/79

Previous analyses based on the entire pol gene or the entire
IN region produced different results, showing the feline
lentiviruses, ungulate lentiviruses and the HIV/SIV group
as equally distant from one another [23,24]. The results of
the present study are likely to be attributed the fact that 1)
we used the isolated CCD; 2) amino acid sequences facilitate the discovery of similarities in the mature proteins by
excluding silent mutations that may have occurred during
phylogenesis. Be that as it may, the finding of a significant
clustering of primate and feline lentivirus IN CCDs
encouraged us to further analyze the similarities of HIV-1
and FIV IN CCDs.
Amino acid conservation between HIV-1 and FIV integrases
Drug resistance studies and site-directed mutagenesis
showed that mutation of any of five HIV-1 IN amino acids
(i.e., T66, E92, F121, Q148, and N155) confers significant
cross-resistance to INSTIs [1,25-27]. Drug resistance
mutations N155H and Q148R were shown to hamper
INSTI binding to HIV-1 IN, by either decreasing the affinity of IN/proviral DNA complexes for INSTIs (N155H) or
affecting assembly of proviral DNA (Q148R) [27]. Previous computational simulations conducted by one of us
suggest that T66, E92, F121, and N155 are involved in
important interactions of HIV-1 IN with the antiretroviral
drugs [22].

virus (RSV) [PDB: 1ASV] served as outgroup. Sequence
adopted: equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) [Swiss-Prot:
P11204]; Jembrana disease virus, belonging to the bovine
immunodeficiency virus (BIV) group [REFSEQ:
NC_001654.1]; human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV1) [PDB: 1BL3C]; simian immunodeficiency virus, host:
macaque (SIV-mac) [PDB: 1C6VC]; feline immunodeficiency
virus, host: domestic cat (FIV-Fca) [REFSEQ: NP_040973.1];
feline immunodeficiency virus, host: Pallas' cat (FIV-Oma)
[GenBank: AAB49923]; puma lentivirus (FIV-Pco) [GenBank:
AAA67168]; caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus (CAEV)
[Swiss-Prot: P33459]; visna lentivirus [Swiss-Prot: P23427].

To analyze differences between HIV-1 and feline lentiviruses at these amino acid positions, we performed alignments of the HIV-1 IN CCD sequence with selected
sequences of INs from highly divergent feline lentiviruses.
The amino acid positions corresponding to T66, E92,
F121, Q148, and N155 in HIV-1 IN were found to be
highly conserved between HIV-1 and feline lentiviruses
(Fig. 2). These amino acids are also conserved in simian
immunodeficiency virus (SIV) IN (susceptible to INSTIs
[26]) but not in Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) IN (which is
not inhibited by INSTIs [26]). As regards the less important primary drug resistance mutations of HIV-1 IN, i.e.
S147, S153 and E157, only the amino acid corresponding
to HIV-1 IN S147 is conserved in FIV IN. These amino
acids, however, do not confer cross resistance to the different INSTIs and were shown to confer low-level resistance
only to the quinolonic INSTI, namely elvitegravir [25].
Moreover, apart from S147, these amino acids are not
even conserved in SIVmac IN, which is known to be fully
susceptible to important classes of INSTIs such as diketo
acids and naphthyridine carboxamides [26].
Recent phylogenetic analyses suggest that feline lentiviruses are monophyletic [28]. Therefore, the amino acid
conservation shown by the highly divergent sequences
examined in the present study most likely includes the
majority of feline lentiviruses. For example, the key residues for response to INSTIs are conserved not only in the

dence for susceptibility of FIV to INSTIs. Indeed, other
amino acids that are not conserved between HIV-1 and
FIV may contribute to conformational differences and be
capable of limiting susceptibility to INSTIs.

We conclude that FIV and HIV-1 INs share conservation of
some amino acid residues important for response to INSTIs. This finding per se, however, could not be used as evi-

In-silico modeling of FIV integrase catalytic core domain
complexed with the transferred strand of proviral DNA
and molecular docking of antiretroviral drugs
Starting with conservation of important HIV-1 and FIV IN
residues, we built a 3D model of IN CCD of the Petaluma
strain of FIV (FIV-Pet) by homology with HIV-1 IN CCD.
Homology modeling of FIV IN CCD based on a crystal
structure of its HIV-1 counterpart was encouraged by the
high level of conservation of the 3D structures of the catalytic sites of retroviral INs and the related enzyme Tn5
transposase. Homology modeling is a viable technique in
the absence of crystal structures of a given protein, and
helps in predicting the 3D structure of a macromolecule
with unknown structure (target) by comparing it with a
known template from another, structurally highly similar,
macromolecule. In general, 30% sequence homology is
required for generating useful models. Here, the sequence
identity between target and template was 44%. As a template structure, we chose the subunit C of the structure of
HIV-1 IN CCD described by Maignan et al. [29] Similarly
to all HIV-1 IN structures complexed with metals, the
structure of Maignan et al. presents only one of the (likely)
two metal ions in the catalytic cavity, but, differently from
other published HIV-1 IN CCD structures, displays a well
ordered catalytic triad [29]. Another reason for considering the structure of Maignan et al. for our homology modeling purpose was the presence of the entire flexible loop
(amino acids 140–152) in chain C. The flexible loop is
often absent from published IN CCD structures or in positions which likely do not reflect that assumed in vivo. In
chain C of the structure of Maignan et al., the flexible loop
connects two CCD subunits in a dimer that may have biological significance, as the distance between the two active
sites corresponds to 18 Å, approximately one half turn of
a Watson-Crick-Franklin DNA helix (i.e., the distance at
which the two antiparallel strands of acceptor DNA are
simultaneously nicked during strand transfer) [22]. Thus,
the flexible loop is, in this case, likely to be in a position
reflecting that assumed in pre-integration complexes [22].

The FIV-Pet IN CCD was thus modeled using chain C of
the structure of Maignan et al. as a template. The resulting
model was subjected to energy minimization, and Ramachandran analysis was done to validate the model.
Results showed that the sequence of FIV-Pet IN CCD was
consistent with the 3D folding of HIV-1 IN CCD: 95% of
the residues were in Ramachandran-favored position and
5% were in Ramachandran-allowed positions [see Additional file 1]. When HIV-1 and FIV IN CCD structures were
superimposed, all amino acids facing the catalytic cavity
were similar, except for HIV-1 IN Y143, which is substituted with a glycine in FIV (Figs 2 and 3A).
As INSTIs were shown to require proviral DNA to bind to
HIV-1 IN [1,27], a model for the FIV IN CCD complexed

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/4/1/79

with the transferred strand of proviral DNA was prepared
to simulate INSTI binding to the catalytic cavity of FIV IN.
Briefly, the homology-based model for FIV IN CCD was
superimposed to a crystal structure of Tn5 transposase
complexed with transposable DNA [PDB: 1MM8] (the
structural similarities between the catalytic cavities of Tn5
transposase and retroviral INs have been previously
described [20,22,30]). The 3' filament of transposable
DNA (corresponding to the transferred strand of retroviral
DNA) and the metal ion coordinating the 3' DNA
hydroxyl were transferred to the FIV IN CCD model. The
terminal dinucleotide was manually corrected to 5'-CA-3'
(i.e. the highly conserved dinucleotide at the 3' end of
integrated lentiviral DNA; see Fig. 3A), and the DNA-coordinating Mn++ ion was corrected to a Mg++ type, i.e. the
metal likely to be present in vivo [1]. The E152 sidechain
was brought to metal-coordinating position, as previously
described for a two-metal model of HIV-1 IN CCD [22].
The position of the second Mg++ ion likely to be important
for INSTI binding (i.e., that between residues corresponding to D64 and D116 of HIV-1 IN [1,20,22]) was deduced
from the HIV-1 IN CCD structure of Maignan et al. [PDB:
1BL3].
Docking simulations of compounds (8,9), namely,
respectively, CHI1019 and L-870,810 (see Fig. 4), were
conducted using the genetic algorithm GOLD. These compounds are representative of two important classes of INSTIs. CHI1019 is a novel diketo acid, which was recently
designed by some of us and shown to inhibit HIV-1 replication in vitro [31]. L-870,810 is a naphthyridine carboxamide developed by Merck researchers, which was the first
INSTI to furnish proof of concept for an antiretroviral
effect in humans [1,26]. We found that the structures of
the investigational INSTIs allowed docking at the FIV IN
catalytic cavity (Fig. 2B–C ). The INSTIs displayed high
GOLD fitness scores (> 60; data not shown), which are in
our experience significantly associated with enzyme
inhibitory interactions [22]. We conclude that the calculated structure of the catalytic cavity of FIV IN complexed
with the transferred strand of proviral DNA is sterically
consistent with docking of INSTIs.
Both compounds interacted with the two metals within
the catalytic cavity. In both cases, the metal-interacting
groups were consistent with the pharmacophoric groups
described in the 'classic' studies on HIV-1 IN (i.e., a γ-keto
α-enol carboxylate for the diketo acid, and a β-enol carboxamide plus a lonely pair donor nitrogen for the naphthyridine carboxamide [1,26]). Table 1 summarizes the
most important interactions between ligands and FIV INDNA complex, considering the residues included in a distance of 5.0 Å starting from the center of the ligand. Of
note, interacting residues include FIV IN T59, E85, F114
and N147, which correspond to HIV-1 IN T66, E92, F121

solution.

between D66 and D116 were present as well, but were
provided by oxygens in the substituents [22]. Similar
docking solutions were obtained also in the present study
but had lower GOLD fitness scores (data not shown). Differences between the present study and the previous one
can be attributable to differences between the predicted
folding of FIV IN and the 3D structure of HIV-1 IN, or
between the 5CITEP molecule mimicking proviral DNA
and the proviral DNA model proposed in the present
study. On the other hand, it is possible that both docking
poses coexist in vivo, given the alternative binding modes
crystallographically documented for other ligands.
In vitro activity of integrase inhibitors in FIV-infected cell
cultures
If our model for the FIV IN/INSTI interaction is correct,
INSTIs designed for HIV-1 should also inhibit FIV replication in cell cultures. For this purpose, feline lymphoblastoid MBM cells were acutely infected with FIV-Pet in the
presence or absence of different concentrations of
CHI1019 or L-870,810. The NRTI abacavir was used as a
positive control for FIV inhibition due to its known antiFIV effects [7]. As expected, abacavir efficiently abated FIV
replication (P = 0.0053; t-test for regression) with a 50%

and 1 µM, respectively, did not inhibit FIV p24 production in FL-4 cells harboring copies of integrated FIV DNA
(data not shown). We conclude that the test compounds
inhibit FIV replication pre-integrationally as effectively as
reported for HIV-1. Small differences in the EC50 in HIV-1
and FIV assays are likely to be attributed to the different
tests and cell lines adopted.
Quantification by real-time PCR of viral DNA products in
the presence of integrase inhibitors
If INSTIs indeed inhibited IN strand transfer within the
acutely FIV-infected cells, circular forms of proviral DNA
should accumulate intracellularly, as previously reported
using HIV-1-infected cells [26]. To investigate this effect in
FIV-infected cell cultures, we set up and performed quantitative real-time PCR assays to measure total and circular
FIV DNA forms [see Additional file 2]. This PCR assay can
detect and quantify the total viral DNA (represented by a
153 bp IN CCD fragment), and the circle structure (represented by a 173 bp fragment at the circle junction). The
real-time PCR assays developed were found to be reliable
and reproducible [see Additional file 3]. To measure the
effects of INSTI treatment on viral DNA products, we
infected the MBM cells with FIV-Pet in the presence or

effective concentration (EC50) below 0.625 µM (data not
shown). Likewise, CHI1019 inhibited FIV replication in a
concentration-dependent manner (P = 0.0142; t-test for
regression) with a calculated EC50 of 3.16 µM (1.0–5.6
µM; 95% confidence limits/CL) at seven days post-infection (Fig. 5A). Similar EC50 values had previously been
reported in HIV-1-infected cell cultures (2.4 µM [31]). The
concentration of CHI1019 decreasing MBM cell viability
by 50% (CC50 ≅ 42.8 µM; data not shown) was approximately one order of magnitude higher than the EC50, in
line with that reported for human lymphoblastoid MT-4
cell line (49.2 µM [31]). The selectivity index of CHI1019
for FIV-Pet was thus calculated to be 13.4. Similar results
were obtained using the non-fluorinated analogue
CHI1010 (data not shown). Naphthyridine carboxamide
L-870,810 also inhibited FIV replication in a concentration-dependent manner (P = 0.0005; t-test for regression).
L-870,810 acted as a more potent inhibitor of FIV replication as compared to the diketo acids, the EC50 residing in
the low nanomolar range (mean: 2.4 nM; 95%CL: 1.0–4.5
nM Fig. 5B). These results are in line with the EC50 values
reported in HIV-1 infected cell cultures (ranging from 4 to
15 nM [26]). No toxic effects were observed using L870,810 at concentrations up to 10 µM. In full agreement
with results obtained with HIV-1 [26], the selectivity
index of L-870,810 was in the order of approximately 104,
making it one of the most potent anti-FIV agents ever
tested in vitro.

103 in L-870,810-treated cells at 12 h post-infection,
means ± S.D., two experiments), thus showing that this
drug does not interfere with reverse transcription or any of
the steps of FIV replication preceding it. In contrast, the
circular proviral DNA increased proportionally over time
in L-870,810-treated cells (Fig. 6). This result provides
additional evidence that L-870,810 inhibits FIV infection
at the level of retroviral integration.

Conclusion
To sum up, the results of the present study strongly suggest that FIV IN is susceptible to INSTIs designed for HIV1. There was a good agreement between the results of the
bioinformatic analyses of FIV IN and those of the biological assays. These findings may enhance our knowledge of
this class of enzymes, which represents a new important
target in treatment of HIV-1/AIDS.
Susceptibility of FIV to INSTIs has important implications
for continuing research with FIV as an animal model for
lentiviral infections. Of course, trials in FIV-infected animals are required before extending the conclusions of the
present study to in-vivo settings. If in-vivo experiments
should confirm FIV susceptibility to INSTIs, this animal
model could allow studying the long-term effects of drug
treatment on viral persistence or emergence of resistant
isolates. The FIV model would have the advantage of
being low cost and easily accessible.

practice. Therefore, the present study may also provide the
bases for providing a potential treatment to alleviate disease and prolong survival time of infected pet cats. For
example, L-870,810, an INSTI successfully tested in
humans, used in combination with NRTIs active on FIV
could lead to an ART equivalent for feline AIDS.

Methods
Sequences and viral isolates
All amino acid sequences of lentiviral INs were retrieved
from the U.S. National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website [32] except for the pol sequences of
FIV-M2 and FIV-M3 isolates. FIV-M2 and FIV-M3 were isolated from two naturally infected cats living in Pisa, Italy.
Based on gag and env sequencing, the two viruses were
classified as FIV-Fca Clade B [33]. FIV-Fca is the feline lentivirus circulating in domestic cats [28]. By limiting the in
vitro cultivation in feline lymphoblastoid MBM cells to at
minimum (see below), these isolates retained most of the
features (i.e. high resistance to antibody-mediated neutralization, pathogenicity) typical of the field isolates [34].
For the present study, the genomic DNA of FIV-M2- and
FIV-M3-infected MBM cells was extracted with the
QIAamp blood kit (Qiagen, Milan, Italy) and PCR-amplified with primers encompassing the whole pol gene.
Amplicons were then sequenced by cycle sequencing
using an automated DNA sequencer (GE Healthcare,
Milan, Italy). Primers used for amplification and sequencing and PCR amplification profiles are available upon
request by e-mail. Sequences are being submitted to GenBank.
Phylogenetic analysis
Sequences were aligned using Clustal-X [35], and then the
amino acid alignment was manually edited in order to
maximize positional homology using the Bioedit program (version 7.0.9.0) [36]. Gaps were removed from the
final alignment. Phylogenetic trees were generated with
the F84 model of substitution using neighbor-joining
method. The statistical robustness and reliability of the
branching order within each phylogenetic tree were confirmed with a bootstrap analysis using 1000 replicates. All
calculations were performed with PAUP* software, version 4.0b10 (D. L. Swofford, Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA) [37].
Molecular modeling
Reference 3D structures of HIV-1 IN CCD [PDB:1BL3] and
Tn5 transposase [PDB: 1MM8] were retrieved from the
Protein Data Bank (PDB) [38] through the NCBI website
[32]. For homology modeling, target and template
sequences were aligned using CLUSTALX. The alignment
was then submitted electronically to the Swiss Model
server [39], which automatically generates a homology
model based on the template structure. Energy computa-

tions were done in vacuo using the GROMOS96 implementation of the Swiss PDB Viewer (SPDBV) program
(Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics) [39]. Energy minimization was carried out by 20 cycles of steepest descent, and
minimization stopping when the ∆ energy was below 0.05
kJ/mol, as previously described [22]. Hydrogens were
added using VEGA ZZ (University of Milan, Italy; freely
available at: [40]). The model was then submitted to the
MolProbity server [41] for Ramachandran analysis.
To obtain structural alignments, the α-carbons of the
highly conserved catalytic triads were initially superimposed using SPDBV, which minimizes the root-meansquare distance (RMSD) between the corresponding
atoms using a least square algorithm [39]. Using the
default matrix embedded in the program (with open and
extended gap penalties of 6 and 4, respectively), the calculation was extended to neighboring atoms until the maximum number of aligned atoms with the lowest RMSD was
obtained. The SPDBV software was used to visualize the
superimposed structures and transfer selected items from
one structure to another. Nucleic acid structures were corrected manually using VEGA. The same program was also
used to add hydrogens to the nucleic acids.
The docking platform was further improved using the
option' prepare file for docking programs' available at the
WHAT-IF web interface [42], which performs a small regularization of submitted structures. The protein file was
eventually converted to mol2 format using Mercury (v.
1.4.2; Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre/CCDC,
Cambridge, UK).
Ligand 3D structures were initially generated as pdb files
using the CORINA web interface [43], on the basis of the
SMILES strings published in the NCBI website. The program VEGA was adopted to assign the correct bond types.
The compounds were considered in their keto-enol tautomeric form, since it has been clearly established that these
molecules mainly exist in this form in solution (reviewed
in: [1]). Moreover, both ionic forms were generated for
the carboxylic acid and enol groups of compounds. Using
the default parameters in the VEGA program, force fields
and charges were assigned according to AMBER and
Gasteiger algorithms, respectively, and the molecules were
energy-minimized by 50 cycles of conjugate gradients, as
previously described [22]. Minimization was stopped
when the RMSD between two subsequent solutions was
lower than 0.1 Å. Energy minimized ligands were then
saved as mol files [22].
Automated docking studies were then performed using
the genetic algorithm GOLD (Genetic Optimization for
Ligand Docking) (v. 3.1; CCDC), according to a protocol
previously validated by some of us [20,22]. The binding

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/4/1/79

site was initially defined as all residues of the target within
10 Å from the metal atom coordinated by aspartate residues corresponding to HIV-1 IN D64 and D116, and later
automated cavity detection was used. GOLD score was
chosen as fitness function and the standard default settings were used in all calculations. For each of the 10 independent genetic algorithm runs, a default maximum of
10,000 genetic operations was performed, using the
default operator weights and a population size of 100
chromosomes. Default cutoff values of 2.5 Å for hydrogen
bonds and 4 Å for Van der Waals interactions were
employed. The two metal ions were set to allow hexavalent coordination according to a Mg2+ type (i.e. the metal
thought to act as a co-factor in vivo). Carboxylate and carboxamide substituents on aromatic rings were allowed to
rotate. Early termination was allowed for results differing
by less than 1.5 Å in ligand all atom RMSD.
The target/ligand complexes obtained were optimized
using the force field CHARMM [44] by two sets of minimizations: the first one was carried out using the steepest
descent algorithm with 1000 maximum interactions until
the RMSD was 0.1, while the second minimization was
performed using the conjugated gradients algorithm,
again with 1000 maximum interactions until the RMSD
was 0.1.
Post-docking analysis was carried out using SILVER
(CCDC).
Drugs
The synthesis of CHI1010 and CHI1019 was performed as
previously reported [31] and summarized in Fig. 4. 5Chloro-1H-indole (1) was 3-acetylated (2) by reaction
with acetyl chloride using diethylaluminum chloride as
catalyst and then N-alkylated by treatment with the suitable benzyl bromide in the presence of sodium hydride to
give the corresponding 3-acetyl-1-benzyl-1H-indole (3–
4). These derivatives were successively condensed with
diethyl oxalate and a catalytic amount of sodium methoxide to give ethyl esters (5–6). This reaction was performed
under microwave irradiation: reaction times were strikingly reduced (i.e. 4 min.), yields were almost quantitative. Finally, deketoesters were converted by basic
hydrolysis into the corresponding acids (7–8). L-870,810
(purified powder) was a gentle gift of Merck and Co.
(West Point, PA).
Test for detection of activity of integrase inhibitors in vitro
Inhibition of FIV replication was assessed in the feline
lymphoblastoid MBM cells, a CD3+, CD4-, and CD8- T
lymphocyte cell line originally established from an FIVnegative and feline leukemia virus-negative cat [45]. Cells
were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum, 5 µg of concanavalin A, and 20

U/ml of human recombinant interleukin-2 (Roche Diagnostics, Milan, Italy). Viral stocks of FIV-Pet were obtained
from the chronically infected feline T-lymphocyte FL-4
cells [46], as previously described [47].
In the uninfected controls, drug cytotoxicity and CC50 values were determined by trypan blue exclusion, by the MTT
method and by propidium iodide staining, according to
standard techniques previously validated in our hands
[48].
Virus inhibition assays were performed in 96-well microplates with 105 MBM cells and 200 FIV-Pet infectious
doses/well. Briefly, MBM cells resuspended in 100 µl of
culture medium were mixed with an equal volume of
medium containing the virus and decreasing concentrations of CHI1010, CHI1019, L-870,810 or abacavir at
which no toxic effects had been observed. Cells were then
incubated at 37°C for 4 h. Cells were then washed to
remove the excess virus and grown in fresh medium with
the above-mentioned drug concentrations. At day 4, 100
µl of supernatant was collected from each well and
replaced with fresh medium plus test compounds. Cultures were stopped on Day 7, and virus released in supernatant was monitored for FIV p25 capsid protein content
as described using commercially-available FIV p25 ELISA
kits (Cell Biolabs, Inc., San Diego, CA), following the
manufacturer's instructions. Each drug concentration was
tested in triplicate. Inhibition of viral replication was calculated as percent reduction of mean p25 concentration
in wells inoculated with FIV and the drug, compared to
mean p25 readouts in wells inoculated with FIV alone.
To test the dose-dependence of inhibition of virus or cell
growth, serial concentrations of the antiretrovirals were
plotted against the percentage-of-inhibition values as previously described [48]. An appropriate transformation
such as Log or logit was used to restore normality. The logit
of a number x between 0 (0%) and 1 (100%) was defined
as: logit x = Log [x/(1-x)]. The line that best fitted the points
was calculated by the least squares method. t-tests were
used to analyze slope values (t-test for regression). The
EC50 and CC50 values, means and 95% confidence limits,
were deduced from the regression line and transposed
onto a linear scale. Calculations were conducted using the
GrapPad software (V. 4.0; GraphPad Software, Inc., San
Diego, CA).
Quantitative real-time PCR assays
To quantitate total and circular proviral DNA, 12 h- and
24 h-old FIV-infected MBM cell cultures (106/sample)
were harvested, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and
treated with 500 units of DNaseI (Roche Diagnostics) at
37°C for 1 h prior to DNA extraction. DNAs were prepared by the standard protocol for DNA extraction from

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/4/1/79

cells with the Nucleospin Blood Quick Pure kit (Macherey-Nagel GmbH, Düren, Germany) according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
For PCR assays, two different primer pairs were designed
from the FIV-Pet nucleotide sequence (accession number
M25381). The primer pair 5'-AGGGAACCCACAGTCACAAG-3' (position 4829–4848)/5'-GCCATCCCTCCTATCCTACC-3' (position 4987–4968) and 5'CTTGAGGCTCCCACAGATACAAT-3' (position 9367–
9389)/5'- GTTCGTAAACAGTCCCTAGTCC -3' (position
66–45) allowed the amplification of 159 bp in the pol
gene (IN core region) and 173 bp of the proviral DNA circle respectively.
A sybergreen real-time PCR assay was set up to detect and
quantify the viral DNA using LightCycler instrument
(Roche Diagnostics, Germany). To this aim, a recombinant plasmid carrying the 159 bp pol fragment obtained
from genomic DNA of chronically FIV-Pet infected FL-4
cells, was generated by cloning the amplicon into pGEM
T-easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI). PCR reaction was
carried out in glass capillary tubes (Roche Diagnostics)
containing 150 ng of genomic DNA, 7. 5 µl of 2X commercial ready-to-use PCR master mix sybergreen (QuantiTect sybr green PCR kit, Qiagen, GmbH, Germany), and
0.5 µM of primers (15 µl final volume). Thermal cycling
conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95°C
for 15 min, followed by 45 amplification cycles at 94°C
for 15 s, 56°C for 20 s, and 72°C for 20 s. Fluorescence
was measured on F1 channel at each extension phase, and
the amplification was followed by a melting program,
which started at 94°C for 3 s, 65°C for 10 s and then
increased to 92°C at 0.1°C/s, with the fluorescence signal
continuously monitored on-line.
Ten-fold serial dilutions (from 107 to 102 copies) of the
recombinant plasmid previously characterized were used
as standards in all experiments. Samples, PCR-negative
control (ultrapure water PCR grade) and DNA standards
were run in parallel and in triplicate.
For the quantitative interpretation of the LightCycler
results the "fit point method" algorithm was used, as previously described [49]. A calibration curve was generated
from amplification of standard serial dilutions, and
threshold cycle (Ct) values were determined and plotted
against plasmid copy numbers. Variation over time of the
proportion of circular forms of proviral DNA was assessed
by Bonferroni's posttest following two-way ANOVA.
