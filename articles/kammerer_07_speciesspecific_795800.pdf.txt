Abstract
Background: Although the impact of pathogens on the evolution of the mammalian immune system is still under
debate, proteins, which both regulate immune responses and serve as cellular receptors for pathogens should be
at the forefront of pathogen-driven host evolution. The CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) gene family codes for
such proteins and indeed shows tremendous species-specific variation between human and rodents. Since little is
known about the CEA gene family in other lineages of placental mammals, we expected to gain new insights into
the evolution of the rapidly diverging CEA family by analyzing the CEA family of the dog.
Results: Here we describe the complete CEA gene family in the dog. We found that the gene coding for the
ITIM-bearing immunoregulatory molecule CEACAM1 gave rise to a recent expansion of the canine CEA gene
family by gene duplication, similar to that previously found in humans and mice. However, while the murine and
human CEACAMs (carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules) are predominantly secreted and
GPI-anchored, respectively, in the dog, most of the CEACAMs represent ITAM-bearing transmembrane proteins.
One of these proteins, CEACAM28, exhibits nearly complete sequence identity with the ligand-binding N domain
of CEACAM1, but antagonizing signaling motifs in the cytoplasmic tail. Comparison of nonsynonymous and
synonymous substitutions indicates that the CEACAM28 N domain is under the strongest purifying selection of
all canine CEACAM1-related CEACAMs. In addition, CEACAM28 shows a similar expression pattern in resting
immune cells and tissues as CEACAM1. However, upon activation CEACAM28 mRNA and CEACAM1 mRNA
are differentially regulated.
Conclusion: Thus, CEACAM1 and CEACAM28 are the first paired immune receptors identified within the CEA
gene family, which are expressed on T cells and are most likely involved in the fine-tuning of T cell responses. The
direction of gene conversion accompanied by purifying selection and expression in immune cells suggests the
possibility that CEACAM28 evolved in response to selective pressure imposed by species-specific pathogens.

Background
The evolution of immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF)
members is largely influenced by the nature of their ligands. The extracellular part of IgSF members which are
predominantly expressed in the nervous system are well
conserved, while the extracellular domains of members
expressed by immune cells or cells involved in reproduction tend to diversify much more rapidly [1]. The CEA
gene family, which belongs to the IgSF, is a tandemly clustered multigene family. Such gene families are subject to
rapid evolution due to ongoing gene duplication, deletion
and mutational events [2]. At present, the CEA family is
subdivided into two main subgroups: the CEA-related cell
adhesion molecule (CEACAM) and the pregnancy-specific glycoprotein (PSG) subgroups. The CEACAM subgroup in humans consists of 12 members composed of a
single immunoglobulin variable (IgV)-like N-terminal
(N) domain followed by zero to six Ig constant (IgC)-like
domains of A and B subtypes and one member which consists of two IgC-like domains and two IgV-like domains,
one at each end of the molecule. CEACAM1, CEACAM3,
CEACAM4, CEACAM18, CEACAM19, CEACAM20 and
CEACAM21 are transmembrane molecules while CEA/
CEACAM5, CEACAM6, CEACAM7, and CEACAM8 are
linked to the cell membrane via glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors and CEACAM16 is most likely a
secreted molecule. For CEACAM1 (also known as CD66a,
BGP and C-CAM105) and the recently discovered
CEACAM16, CEACAM18, CEACAM19 and CEACAM20,
but not for other family members have orthologs been
identified in rodents[3]. In addition to these orthologs,
the transmembrane-bound CEACAM2 (in mice),
CEACAM17 (in mice and rats) and the secreted members
CEACAM9, CEACAM10, CEACAM11 CEACAM12,
CEACAM13, CEACAM14, CEACAM15 (in mice and rats)
exist in rodents[3,4]. In mice, rats and cattle, at least two
CEACAM1 alleles each have been identified, which differ
considerably in their N domain sequences[5]. No such
allelic variation has been observed in humans. The PSG,
which are specifically expressed in the trophoblast, are the
most abundant fetal proteins in the maternal bloodstream
during late human pregnancy. The PSGs are thought to
play a pivotal role in the regulation of the maternal
immune response to the fetal semi-allograft[6]. The diversity of the CEACAM/PSG family of proteins is further
enhanced by species-specific differential splicing of several family members[7]. As expected from the variable
structure of the CEA family members, these molecules
have diverse functions. It is well established that various
CEA family members play crucial roles in cell-cell adhesion, tumor development, angiogenesis, insulin metabolism, reproduction and, as more recently realized, in
immunity[8]. CEACAM1 functions as a natural killer cell
inhibitory receptor[9,10], regulates T and B cell proliferation [11,12], induces dendritic cell maturation[13] and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/196

facilitates granulocyte and monocyte survival [14,15]. In
addition, CEACAM3, CEACAM6 and CEACAM8 were
found to be pivotal for the regulation of granulocyte activation in humans[16]. While human CEACAM1 contains
two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs
(ITIM) in its cytoplasmic domain, one CEACAM1 ITIM is
replaced by an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch
motif (ITSM) in mice and rats. Human CEACAM3 and
possibly CEACAM4, CEACAM19 and CEACAM20 harbor
functional immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation
motifs (ITAM) in their cytoplasmic tails [17,18]. In contrast, except for CEACAM19 and CEACAM20 no such
ITAM-containing CEA family members exist in rodents.
Remarkably, several pathogens namely, Neisseria sp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis in
humans[19-21] and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) [22]
use CEACAMs to anchor themselves to or to invade host
cells. In addition, it has been suggested that bacterial pathogens can down-regulate immune functions by binding to
CEACAM1 on CD4+ T lymphocytes and signaling via the
CEACAM1 ITIM motif [23]. It was recently proposed that
the human granulocyte-specific CEACAM3 functions as a
specifically adapted single-chain ITAM-dependent phagocytic receptor involved in the clearance of CEACAM-binding bacteria by human granulocytes[24]. This indicates
that fixation of genes in the human genome coding for
ITAM-bearing CEACAMs can be the result of a selective
pressure mediated by CEACAM-binding pathogenic
microbes. In contrast, one of the two allelic variants of
murine CEACAM1 exhibits a significant lower virus receptor activity suggesting that, in mice, mutations in the
CEACAM1 gene rather than the fixation of an activating
virus receptor were acquired to evade pathogen attack. The
availability of a high-quality draft genome sequence of the
domestic dog (Canis familiaris) [25] provided the possibility to analyze the complete CEA gene family in a third
mammalian order. Here we show that in the dog multiple
ITAM-bearing CEACAM1-related CEACAMs evolved and
that CEACAM28 and CEACAM1 have undergone concerted evolution by gene conversion. Based on sequence
analyses and comparison of expression profiles we suggest
that CEACAM28 and CEACAM1 are paired activating and
inhibitory immune receptors involved in the regulation of
T cell responses. The possibility that sporadic recurrence
of selective pressure mediated by species-specific pathogens was the driving force for the evolution of multiple
ITAM-bearing CEACAM1-related CEACAMs in the dog is
discussed.

Results
Identification of the canine CEA gene family cluster
In an effort to identify all CEA gene family members in the
dog genome we employed the BLAST program to search
the GenBank and Ensemble databases (CanFam 1.0, July
2004) using cDNA nucleotide sequences from all known

human and mouse CEA family members as query
sequences. The human and mouse CEA gene families are
located within the expanded leukocyte receptor complex
on chromosome 19q13 (Figure 1A) and chromosome 7,
respectively. This approach yielded the sequences of the
CEACAM1, CEACAM16, CEACAM18, CEACAM19 and
CEACAM20 orthologs. Their predicted full length mRNA
sequences (Additional file 1) encode proteins with
domain organizations identical with their human and
murine
counterparts:
CEACAM16
(N1-A-B-N2);
CEACAM18 (N-A-B-TM-Cyt); CEACAM19 (N-TM-Cyt);
CEACAM20 (truncated N-A1-B1-A2-B2-TM-Cyt)[3]. Like
their mouse and human counterparts, both CEACAM19
and CEACAM20 contain presumed ITAM consensus
sequences in their cytoplasmic domains. However, like in
mouse, no CEACAM19 cytoplasmic domain exon 1
present in human CEACAM19 was found [3]. As for
human CEACAM18, no cytoplasmic domain exon could
be identified due to its small size and lack of corresponding EST sequences. In a second round of search we used
the BLAST program and cDNA nucleotide sequences from
the identified orthologous canine genes to screen the GenBank and Ensemble databases. This strategy was
employed in order to identify dog-specific genes which
have evolved after the separation of the dog and primate/
rodent lineage. This approach led to the identification of
7 additional CEACAM genes (CEACAM23-CEACAM29)
using CEACAM1 nucleotide sequences as query
sequences. CEACAM23, CEACAM24, CEACAM25,
CEACAM29, CEACAM28 and CEACAM1 are arranged
between XRCC1 and LIPE, while CEACAM26 and
CEACAM27 are located between CD79A and TGFβ1 on
the opposite strand (Figure 1). Surprisingly, no genes corresponding to the PSG genes were found. The murine Psg
genes are located between Hif3a and Pglyrp1 spanning
nearly 1.8 Mbp. In dog, however, the distance between
HIF3A and PGLYRP1 comprises only 0.1 Mbp which rules
out the presence of a larger set of genes between these
marker genes. Similarly, there is not enough space
between XRCC1 and CEACAM23 (0.2 Mbp) to accommodate an expanded PSG gene family as found in humans at
the corresponding chromosomal locations location where
the distance is approximately 1 Mbp (Figure 1B). The
canine CEACAM gene loci on dog chromosome 1 exhibit
a similar arrangement to that found for the human CEA
gene family on chromosome 19 but it is partially different
from that of the murine CEA gene family on chromosome
7 (Figure 1B).
Identification of exons coding for the cytoplasmic domain
of CEACAM1-related CEACAMs
In order to identify the very short cytoplasmic exons of the
CEACAM1-like genes which cannot be localized by direct
search strategies we first localized the transmembrane
exons of all CEACAM genes using transmembrane exon

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/196

sequences of the human and mouse CEACAM genes as
query sequences. Surprisingly, the 6 predicted transmembrane domain exons of the CEACAM1-related canine
genes clustered with the sequences of the transmembrane
domain exons of human CEACAM3, CEACAM4 and
CEACAM21 which are connected to cytoplasmic domain
exons encoding a C-terminal ITAM motif (CEACAM3 and
CEACAM4) or a homologous truncated cytoplasmic
domain with a premature stop (CEACAM21). The
sequence of the transmembrane exon of canine
CEACAM1 clustered with transmembrane sequences from
murine Ceacam1 and Ceacam2 and with a group of exons
coding for hydrophobic GPI signal peptides from human
CEACAM1,
CEACAM5,
CEACAM6,
CEACAM7,
CEACAM8 (Figure 2A and data not shown). CEACAM5CEACAM8 GPI signal peptide exons are thought to have
evolved from the transmembrane exon of an ancestral
CEACAM1 by introduction of a stop codon [26].
CEACAM1/Ceacam1 and Ceacam2 encode cytoplasmic
domains which contain ITIM motifs. Taken together, this
indicates that TM and cytoplasmic domain exons are
exchanged together during evolution and predicts the
presence of ITAM signaling motifs rather than ITIM in the
cytoplasmic tails of the dog CEACAM23-CEACAM25,
CEACAM28 and CEACAM29 molecules. Subsequently,
we screened about 2,000 bp of nucleotide sequence
downstream of the predicted canine transmembrane
domain exons for the presence of the short cytoplasmic
exons. Indeed, small cytoplasmic domain exons similar to
the ones found in human CEACAM3 and CEACAM4
could be identified, which encode ITAM motifs close to
the C-terminal end (Figure 2B). Although homologous
cytoplasmic domain exons 1–3 are present in CEACAM29
the loss of the splice donor site in the cytoplasmic domain
exon 3 leads to read through into the adjacent intron and
truncation by a stop codon following after five codons.
CEACAM26 and CEACAM27 probably represent pseudogenes due to multiple deletions in their extracellular (in
particular N exons) and cytoplasmic domain exons (Figure 3).
Relationship of the canine primordial CEACAM genes with
human and murine counterparts
To determine the degree of relatedness between the primordial canine CEACAM genes with the orthologous
genes in mice and man, the nucleotide and encoded
amino acid sequences of the leader, the IgV-type N
domain, the IgC-type A and B domains, the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic domain exons were
compared (Table 1). The degree of sequence identity
between corresponding extracellular Ig-type domains in
dog, humans and mice varies greatly at the amino acid
sequence level. The lowest value is observed for
CEACAM1 N domains (56% and 42% for human and
mouse, respectively), the highest for the CEACAM16 N2

Cloning of full-length canine CEACAM1-related cDNAs
and identification of splice variants
Based on the genomic sequence information we designed
gene-specific primers for the amplification of full length
CEACAM1-related cDNAs from total RNA, isolated either
from liver or spleen. In the published genomic dog
sequence, one nucleotide is missing from the A1 exon of
canine CEACAM1. Cloning and sequencing of full length
CEACAM1 clones from a mix-breed dog revealed a complete 279 bp CEACAM1 A1 exon. In total, we could iden-

tify 6 different CEACAM1 splice variants. The largest clone
contains an open reading frame of 1563 bp coding for a
521 amino acid protein. Comparisons with CEACAM1
from other species identified the cloned canine CEA family member unequivocally as CEACAM1. It is composed
of a leader sequence, four extracellular immunoglobulinlike domains (N, A1, B and A2), a transmembrane
domain and a cytoplasmic domain (Figure 4). The cytoplasmic domain contains an N-terminal ITIM and a C-terminal ITSM motif similar to that found in the long
CEACAM1 isoforms of mouse, rat and cattle. According to
the nomenclature system for the CEA family, the longest
canine CEACAM1 splice variant was designated

Expansion of ITAM-bearing CEACAM1-related CEA family members in dog. (A) Relationship of transmembrane
domain and hydrophobic GPI signal peptide-encoding exon sequences of human and canine CEA family members. The nucleotide sequences of the transmembrane domain exons and exons encoding the GPI signal peptides of human CEA family members were aligned and the results displayed as rooted dendrogram. Three groups can be discriminated: the transmembrane
domain sequences of the orthologous genes (CEACAM18, CEACAM19 and CEACAM20) form pairs, CEACAM3, CEACAM4
and CEACAM21 sequences are clustered together with the dog CEACAM1-related sequences (red box) and the GPI signal
sequences are most closely related to the CEACAM1 transmembrane exon sequence (blue box). All transmembrane domain
exons boxed red are followed by exons encoding cytoplasmic domains with an ITAM except for CEACAM21 and CEACAM29.
Their cytoplasmic domains terminate prematurely due to a stop codon at the end of cytoplasmic domain exon 2 and loss of the
splice donor site in cytoplasmic domain exon 3 with subsequent read-through into the following intron, respectively. (B)

Exon arrangement of canine CEACAM1-related genes
Exon arrangement of canine CEACAM1-related genes. The exon types are indicated by differently colored boxes. 5'and 3'-UTR are shown as gray, IgV-like domain exons as red, IgC-like domain exons as blue and transmembrane domain exons
as black boxes. The exons encoding the cytoplasmic domain with an ITIM or an ITAM motif are shown in red and blue, respectively. The size of the 3'-UTR is inferred from the position of the first putative polyadenylation signal sequence (AATAAA) after
the stop codon. The presence of deletions/insertions in exons causing reading frame shifts or mutational corrupted splice
donor and acceptor consensus sequences are indicated by an asterisk. No leader exon could be identified for CEACAM23
because of a sequence gap (indicated by brackets) in the publicly available genomic sequences. The genes are arranged in the
order and orientation as found on dog chromosome 1.

CEACAM1-4L (GenBank accession no. DQ975208). The
mRNA encoding the splice variant with the short cytoplasmic tail CEACAM1-4S (GenBank accession no.
DQ975209) differs from CEACAM1-4L mRNA by the
absence of the 53 bp nucleotide cytoplasmic domain
exon1 that leads to a frame shift and to the use of a TGA
stop codon in cytoplasmic domain exon 2 as found for
CEACAM1 of other species. Splice variants without the A1
and the B domain designated CEACAM1-2L (GenBank
accession no. DQ975210) and CEACAM1-2S (GenBank
accession no. DQ975211) also exist as well as two splice
variants without IgC-like domains [CEACAM1-1L (GenBank accession no. DQ975212) and CEACAM1-1S (GenBank accession no. DQ975213)]. Furthermore, we have

cloned the most abundant full length CEACAM23,
CEACAM24, CEACAM25, and CEACAM28 cDNAs. The
CEACAM23 cDNA (GenBank accession no. EF137906)
corresponds to the longest mRNA splice variant predicted
from the genomic sequence of the boxer breed and exhibits an identical nucleotide sequence. CEACAM23 encodes
four extracellular Ig-like domains, a transmembrane
domain and a cytoplasmic tail which harbors a typical
ITAM motif (N-A1-B-A2-TM-Cyt1-Cyt4; Figure 4). The
major CEACAM24 cDNA encodes a protein with an N and
a transmembrane domain (GenBank accession no.
EF137907). The cytoplasmic domain does not contain the
expected ITAM motif due to the presence of the unspliced
intron between the predicted cytoplasmic domain exons 3

The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of leader (L), IgV-like domain (N1, N2), IgC-like domain (A1, A2, B1, B2), transmembrane domain (TM)
and combined cytoplasmic domain exons (Cyt) were compared pairwise using the ClustalW software (Weight Matrix BLOSOM). The degree of
identity is indicated in % (amino acid sequence identity in brackets).

and 4. The cloned CEACAM25 splice variants also code
for proteins with only one N domain followed by a transmembrane domain. Three out of four clones encode cytoplasmic domains which contain the predicted ITAM motif
(GenBank accession no. EF137908). In one clone, the
absence of the 53 nucleotide cytoplasmic domain exon 1
leads to a frame shift and the usage of an alternative stop
codon located in cytoplasmic domain exon3 (GenBank
accession no. EF137909). Using supposedly CEACAM28specific primers, two products were amplified which differ
in their length by 276 bp. Cloning and sequencing
revealed that the CEACAM28 gene codes for a protein
with one N domain, two A domains, a transmembrane
domain and a cytoplasmic tail which contain an ITAM
motif (GenBank accession no. EF137910). The sequence
of the cDNAs cloned from the smaller PCR product was
different from all genomic sequences published either for
the boxer or the poodle breed and, therefore, was named
CEACAM30. The differences are more or less randomly
distributed within the whole coding region which consists
of an N, A, transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain
region. Two CEACAM30 splice variants were identified,
both containing an ITAM motif in the cytoplasmic tail.
They differ, however, in the usage of alternative splice
acceptor sites of the cytoplasmic domain exon 1 (GenBank accession nos. EF137911 and EF137912) (Figure 4).
Relationship of CEACAM1-like genes and CEACAM1
To analyze the evolutionary relationship of the newly discovered CEACAM genes, multiple nucleotide sequence
alignments of Ig domain exons of human and dog
CEACAM genes were performed and phylogenetic trees
constructed. As expected, the N domain sequences of the
orthologous
genes
(CEACAM16,
CEACAM18CEACAM20) clustered pairwise, while all new canine N
domain exon sequences (CEACAM23-CEACAM30) clustered with that from dog CEACAM1 (Figure 5A). Similarly, the primate-specific CEACAM1-related N domain
nucleotide sequences (CEACAM3-CEACAM8) clustered

with the human CEACAM1 N domain exon sequence
except for CEACAM21 N. The close relationship between
the new dog CEACAM genes and dog CEACAM1 could
also be demonstrated when the A and B domain exon
nucleotide sequences were compared (Figure 5B). Nine of
the 17 IgC-like domains of the new CEACAM1-related
canine molecules are of the CEACAM1 A2 type and five
each were of the CEACAM1 A1 and B type (Figure
5B).CEACAM23 appears to be the only CEACAM1-related
gene which contains all extracellular domain exons
present in CEACAM1, in particular three IgC-like domain
exons (A1, A2 and B). All other members of this subgroup
either lack one of these exons or contain exons corrupted
by nonsense, frame shift or splice site mutations leading
to smaller predicted proteins (Figure 3, 4). Assuming that
the N domain is the most relevant domain for ligand
interaction, the ligand specificity of CEACAM28 seems to
be most closely related to that of CEACAM1. The N
domain amino acid sequence of CEACAM28 differs from
that of CEACAM1 in only two positions. These amino acid
changes do not affect the center of the CFG face, a topological N domain region of CEACAM members essential
for ligand and pathogen interactions (Figure 6A,B). Interestingly, CEACAM28 lies next to CEACAM1 in the
CEACAM1 gene cluster which hints to an evolutionary
recent duplication event (Figure 1B). CEACAM25 is the
most distant CEACAM1 relative within the group of
CEACAM1-related genes, sharing only 66% of its N
domain exon encoded amino acid sequence (Figure 5A,
6A; Table 2). Most of the amino acid sequence differences
cluster to the CFG face of the N domains, indicating a positive selection for ligand diversification. To test this possibility, we calculated the ratio of nonsynonymous (Ka) to
synonymous (Ks) nucleotide substitution rates on the
branches of an N exon phylogenetic tree. The lowest Ka/
Ks ratio (0.1) is observed for CEACAM28. This indicates
that the CEACAM28 N domain is under purifying selection. For all other canine CEACAM1-related CEACAMs,
the N domain amino acid changes appear to evolve neu-

since the corresponding Ka/Ks values are close to 1 or
higher (Figure 6C).

Figure organization of dog CEACAM1-related protein
splice variants
Domain 4
Domain organization of dog CEACAM1-related protein splice variants. The domain organization has been
predicted by data mining based on genomic databases and
was confirmed by RT-PCR amplification, cDNA cloning and
sequencing. The number of Ig-related domains and the presence of either a long (L) or short cytoplasmic domain (S) are
indicated above the schematic representation of the proteins. Potential signal consensus motifs in the cytoplasmic
domains are indicated as red (ITIM), yellow (ITSM) and blue
dots (ITAM). Potential N-glycosylation sites are indicated by
lollipops, disulfide bridges by SS.

ITAM-bearing CEACAM1-related genes are expressed by
cells of the immune system
To identify the CEACAM gene expression pattern and
splice variants, their nucleotide sequences were aligned,
and regions of the transmembrane domain-encoding
exons with sequence differences were selected to design
primers that are specific for each of the CEACAM1-related
cDNAs except for CEACAM28 and CEACAM30 which
were amplified with a common primer pair (Table 3). The
primers were used to amplify cDNAs from individual
CEACAM by RT-PCR from RNA isolated from liver, bone
marrow, spleen, purified peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMC), and granulocytes (Figure 7). Except
CEACAM29, all analyzed CEACAM1-related genes,
(CEACAM1, CEACAM23, CEACAM24, CEACAM25,
CEACAM28, and CEACAM30) were found to be expressed
in spleen. CEACAM1, CEACAM24, CEACAM25,
CEACAM28 and CEACAM30 transcripts were detected in
bone marrow and CEACAM1, CEACAM24, CEACAM28
and CEACAM30 mRNAs in PBMC. Granulocytes express
in addition to different CEACAM1 splice variants (preferentially with the long cytoplasmic tail) all the ITAM-bearing molecules except CEACAM23. In liver, the presence of
mainly CEACAM1 and CEACAM23 transcripts could be
demonstrated. CEACAM26 and CEACAM27 are not
expected to be expressed because the sequences of essential exons appear to be corrupted (see above).
Expression of CEACAM1 and CEACAM28 by T cells upon
activation
To further analyze the expression of CEACAM1-related
CEACAMs by immune cells, we isolated T cells from
PBMC by MACS sorting using CD4- and CD8-specific
mAbs. This procedure resulted in a purity of the T cell populations of >97%, as determined by flow cytometry (data
not shown). Activation of T cells by the various stimuli
was controlled by analysis of blast formation using flow
cytometry (Figure 8A). RT-PCR analysis demonstrated
that resting T cells express CEACAM1, CEACAM28 and
CEACAM30 mRNA simultaneously. In addition, expression of these CEACAMs was also found in T cell-depleted
PBMC, which are mainly composed of Bcells (Figure 8B).
Stimulation of PBMC with anti-CD3 mAb or IL-2 had
only a minor effect on CEACAM1 expression in T celldepleted PBMC (data not shown) and T cells. In contrast,
the content of CEACAM28 mRNA seem to be reduced in
T cells upon activation (Figure 8B). In unstimulated T cells
the CEACAM1/CEACAM28 cDNA ratio was < 3 whereas
the ratio was > 7 and > 11 in T cells stimulated with IL-2
and anti-CD3 mAb, respectively (Figure 8C). The content

Relationships of dog CEA gene family members. N domain exon nucleotide sequences from all CEACAM members of
the human and dog CEA gene families (A) or dog CEACAM exons encoding IgC-like domains (B) were aligned and the results
depicted as rooted dendrograms. Human and dog N domain exon sequences from CEACAM1-related genes are shown in blue
and red, the ones from other CEACAM genes in black. The CEACAM1-like gene IgC type domain B, A1 and A2 type nucleotide sequences are depicted in magenta, dark and light green, respectively. Sequences from presumed pseudogenes are
marked by shading. Note that the primordial N exon sequences are most closely related with their respective orthologous
counterpart sequences (except for the primate-specific CEACAM21), while the human and canine CEACAM1-related N exon
sequences cluster with that of members of the same species. Interestingly, CEACAM28 contains two CEACAM1 A2 type
domains (A1, A2) which has not yet been observed for other CEA family members.

Relationships of the N-domains of dog CEA gene family members
Relationships of the N-domains of dog CEA gene family members. (A) The mature N domain amino acid sequences
of the dog CEACAM1-related CEA family members were aligned using the ClustalW program provided at the NPS server.
Identical amino acids are shown in red, conservatively exchanged amino acids in blue and green and non-conservative changes
in black. (B) The amino acid sequence positions which differ between CEACAM1 and the CEACAM1-related N domains
(shown in red) are mapped to 3-D ribbon models calculated using the Geno3D-release 2 program. The models are shown with
the CFG sheet in front (left model) and facing to the left (right model). (C) The ratios of non-synonymous and synonymous
mutation in the N domain exons (small black numbers at the branches of the dendrogram) are close to one or higher (except
for the nearly identical CEACAM1 and CEACAM28 sequences). This indicates selective pressure for divergence of N domain
sequences during evolution. Hsa, Homo sapiens; Cfa, Canis familiaris.

of CEACAM30 mRNA remained unaltered in T cells upon
stimulation (Figure 8B).
CEACAM1 and CEACAM28 are paired immune receptors
created by gene conversion
The near identity of the N domains between CEACAM1
and CEACAM28 is most likely due to a recent gene conversion event. Indeed, we could identify a 2,332 bp
genomic region in CEACAM1 which shows 99% identity
with the corresponding region of CEACAM28. The high
similarity of this segment starts at position -984 of the 5'flanking region and ends at position 114 of the intron
between the Ndomain and the A1 domain exons (Figure

9A). Upstream of this segment, the sequence similarity
between homologous regions of CEACAM28 and
CEACAM1 (~1,200 bp) drops to 80%. The downstream
homologous region of ~1,700 bp demarcated by a SINE
element in CEACAM28 exhibits a similarity of 92%. The
occurrence of such a regionally restricted gene conversion
event is also supported by the high degree of amino acid
sequence similarity of the leader (100%) and N domain
(98%). The A1 and A2 domains of CEACAM28 encoded
outside of the conserved genomic region share only 88%
and 86% of their amino acid sequence with that of the
homologous CEACAM1 A2 domain (Figure 9B). These
data suggests that the similarity between CEACAM1 and

CEACAM1-related transcripts were identified by RT-PCR
using gene-specific primers which are located in the N

Discussion
Recent molecular studies have established strong evidence
for four primary, superordinal mammalian clades: Afrotheria, Xenarthra, Euarchontoglires and Laurasiatheria

[27,28]. The CEA gene family is well known in primates
(humans) and rodents (mice and rats). However, both
orders belong to the same principal lineage of placental
mammals, the Euarchontoglires. Since carnivores belong
to the Laurasiatheria clade, we expected to gain new
insights into the evolution of the rapidly diverging CEA
family by analysis of the CEA family of the dog. First of all,
identification of CEACAM1, CEACAM16, CEACAM18,
CEACAM19 and CEACAM20 orthologs in the dog
genome at corresponding chromosomal locations,
strongly indicates that the CEA gene family of the common ancestor of Euarchontoglires and Laurasiatheria consisted of at least five genes. It remains to be seen whether
species which represent older mammalian lineages like
Afrotheria, marsupials and monotremes contain the same
set of primordial genes. Furthermore, the findings of this
work supports our previous hypothesis that CEACAM3CEACAM8, CEACAM21 and CEACAM9-CEACAM15,
CEACAM17, none of which is present in the dog genome
(Figure 2A and data not shown), represent primate and
rodent-specific genes, respectively [3]. The ancestral members of the CEA gene family are located in three different
loci (Figure 1). While CEACAM16, CEACAM19 and
CEACAM20 are close together (CEACAM16 and
CEACAM19 are next to each other), CEACAM1 is separated from this locus by more than 1 Mbp and
CEACAM18 is displaced into the SIGLEC gene cluster in
humans, mice and dogs.
Out of these ancestral genes, probably only CEACAM1
ancestors gave rise to massive gene expansions in a orderspecific manner [3]. The CEACAM1-related genes form
compact clusters next to CEACAM1 and near the CD79A
gene. In rodents even a third locus (around the Hif3a
gene) has been encroached by amplified CEACAM1related genes. With analysis of the CEA family in a third
order (carnivores), the inversion event observed for the
chromosomal region flanked by Cd79a and Lipe can now
be decided to have happened in the rodent rather than in
the primate lineage, since the order of genes in this locus
is conserved between humans and dogs (Figure 1).
CEACAM1-related genes can be subdivided into the PSG
and the CEACAM subgroup genes. The birth of the ancestral PSG has been estimated to have occurred some 90 Myr
ago [29], approximately the time of rodent-primate divergence[30]. The rapid, independent expansion of the
human and mouse PSG gene families occurred through
further gene duplication and exon shuffling events [3133]. Surprisingly, we did not find any PSG gene in the dog
genome indicating that the PSG function exerted in primates and rodents is dispensable for the dog, possibly
because dogs have an endotheliochorial placenta type
which is different from the hemochorial placentae of primates and rodents[34]. Semi-allogeneic fetal trophoblast

Expression of the paired receptors CEACAM1 and CEACAM28 in stimulated T cells
Expression of the paired receptors CEACAM1 and CEACAM28 in stimulated T cells. RNA was isolated from purified lymphocyte populations. CEACAM1 and CEACAM28 transcripts were identified by RT-PCR. Gene-specific primers
located in the N domain and transmembrane exons were used for CEACAM1 cDNA amplification. The primers for
CEACAM28 cDNA detection coamplified CEACAM30 cDNA due the close relatedness of the two genes. For comparison,
GAPDH cDNA (226 bp) was amplified from the same cDNA samples. (A) Activation of T cells was controlled by determining
blast formation by flow cytometry. Blast formation characterized by cell enlargement is demonstrated by an increase of the forward scatter of the T cells (encircled cell populations) (B) The products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis in the
presence of ethidium bromide and visualized by UV illumination. The amount of cDNA was quantified by endpoint determination with the Quantity 1® software. Note the increase of the CEACAM1/CEACAM28 cDNA ratio after stimulation of T cells
with IL-2 and CD3 (C).

results in an average amino acid identity of about 54%
between human and mouse orthologs [1]. The conservation of the CEACAM1 N domain, most relevant for pathogen and cell-cell interactions [37], lies within this range,
with an amino acid identity of 56% (dog versus human)
and 42% (dog versus mouse). This is consistent with the
notion that CEACAM1 plays a key role in various functions of the immune system[8]. In contrast, between
mouse and human CEACAM16, CEACAM18 and
CEACAM19 orthologs, the N domain amino acid identities are higher ranging from 60% to 91%, which argues for
non-immunological functions, especially for CEACAM16,
which exhibits an overall amino acid sequence identity of
about 90% (Table 1).

gene conversion
CEACAM1 and CEACAM28 genomic regions involved in
CEACAM1 and CEACAM28 genomic regions
involved in gene conversion. The 2332 bp genomic
region of CEACAM1 which covers nearly 1 kb of the 5'-flanking region (5'-FR), the leader exon (L), intron 1 (IntI), the N
domain exon (N) and part of intron 2 (Int II) is highly conserved in CEACAM28 (99%) and, therefore, probably participated in a recent gene conversion event. The homologous
sequences upstream and downstream from the conserved
region are less conserved (80% and 92%, respectively) (A).
This can also be deduced from the degree of conservation of
the amino acid sequences encoded by the leader, N and A
domains which is much less outside of the gene conversion
region. Note that CEACAM28 contains two A2 type
domains (B).
cells are less invasive and concomitantly less prone to
encounter the maternal immune system in endotheliochorial placentae in comparison to the hemochorial placentae where the trophoblast cells are bathed in maternal
blood[35]. Therefore, PSG could be involved in the regulation of trophoblast invasion and/or modulation of the
maternal immune system as has been suggest
before[3,36]. Alternatively, the function of the PSG could
have been taken over by an unrelated gene family due to
functional convergence at the molecular level, similar to
that found for natural killer (NK) cell receptors, where
killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) and Ctype lectin-like receptors (Ly49) are used in primates and
rodents, respectively.
In contrast to the PSG, the CEACAM subgroup of canine
CEACAM1-related genes underwent a recent expansion
similar to that found in primates and rodents. In general,
IgSF members which are expressed by leucocytes are
diverging rapidly within their extracellular domains. This

The dog CEACAM1-related genes are arranged head to
tail, like the KIR genes in the human KIR locus[38,39].
Such an arrangement was found to facilitate unequal
crossing over leading to gene expansion and generation of
multigene families [40]. Furthermore, the KIR gene family
is subject to birth-and-death evolution, domain shuffling
and mutational changes [41]. Our analyses indicate that
the CEA gene family evolved similarly. One characteristic
for this kind of evolution is the presence of multiple pseudogenes, which also exist within the canine CEACAM1like gene locus (CEACAM26, CEACAM27).
This type of evolution also facilitates a mechanism for
qualitatively changing a receptor's signaling potential. A
number of type I transmembrane IgSF members including
CEACAMs and KIRs are composed of an amino-terminal
extracellular "environmental sensor" and a carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic tail which can contain either inhibitory
(ITIM) or activating motifs (ITAM or a positively charged
amino acid in the transmembrane region permitting coupling with activating adaptors such as DAP12[42]). Unequal crossing-over at such gene loci encompassing the
corresponding exons could result, in a single step, in genes
encoding receptors with a drastically changed signaling
potential by combining the same extracellular domain
with a cytoplasmic tail of opposite function. This allows
rapid adaptation to environmental changes and the creation of so-called paired immune receptors. An example for
such a mechanism is found for the KIR gene KIR3DL/S,
where either an inhibitory variant or an activating variant
encoding KIR gene is found in different human individuals at the same locus[43]. In addition, a change in the
receptor's signaling potential which may be the result of
an arms race between pathogens and the host immune
system has been reported recently for mice. The murine
cytomegalovirus (MCMV) induces in infected cells expression of the virus-encoded GPI-anchored m157 protein,
which binds to the activating, DAP12-associating killer
receptor Ly49H in MCMV-resistant mice leading to
NKcell-mediated cytotoxicity. MCMV-susceptible mouse

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:196

strains do not have Ly49H but the extracellularly very similar ITIM-bearing Ly49I protein which has inhibitory killer
cell receptor activity. Binding of m157 to LY49I in such
mice may inhibit NK cell cytotoxicity thus rendering the
mice susceptible to MCMV infection[44]. It was suggested
that the activating receptor gene was derived from the
gene encoding the inhibitory receptor to counteract a
virus that exploits the inhibitory receptor during infection
and that this mechanism may apply to many other activating receptors that have inhibitory counterparts[45,46].
However, recently it was shown for the human SIGLEC5
and SIGLEC14 genes that the direction of gene conversion
that generates paired immune receptors is not always the
same. This indicates that also other needs drive the evolution of paired receptors like the fine tuning of immune
responses [45]. Host-pathogen interactions involving
both proteins with ITIM or ITAM signaling motifs have
also been reported for humans. The primate-specific
CEACAM1-related protein CEACAM3 which contains an
N domain closely related to that of CEACAM1 (88%
amino acid sequence identity) and a cytoplasmic tail with
an ITAM is exclusively expressed in granulocytes. Due to
its close relatedness with the ITIM-bearing gonococcal
receptor CEACAM1 it can act as decoy receptor for Neisserial pathogens and is able to induce clearance of gonococcal infections by granulocytes. Mutational analyses
demonstrated that the cytoplasmic ITAM is instrumental
for this process [24].
To our knowledge, CEACAM1 and CEACAM28 represent
the first paired coexpressed immune receptors which contain antagonizing ITIM and ITAM (and not just a transmembrane domain with a positively charged amino acid
which serves as a docking site for ITAM-containing adaptor molecules, like DAP12) in their respective cytoplasmic
tails. CEACAM28 was probably formed from a
CEACAM29 ancestor by a recent gene conversion encompassing the leader and the N exon from CEACAM1. The
latter exon encodes the region most instrumental for ligand and pathogen binding in CEACAM molecules. Several findings, presented here, argue for a role of
CEACAM28 as a CEACAM1 decoy receptor in the dog.
First, the direction of the gene conversion was most likely
from the inhibitory receptor to the activating receptor, second, the Ka/Ks ratio of the N domain exons of these family members is indicative for a purifying selection,
whereby the specificity of the putative CEACAM1 ligand is
probably conserved for CEACAM28, third, the amino acid
changes observed for the CEACAM28 N domain most
likely have no effect on the structure of that part of the N
domain shown to be the pathogen binding site in human
and mouse CEACAM1 and fourth, is expressed by
immune cells (T, probably B and/or NK cells and granulocytes), a prerequisite for a defense function against a putative pathogen. Based on a highly similar amino acid

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/196

sequence and expression pattern CEACAM30 can be envisioned to also function, like CEACAM28, as a decoy receptor.
However, this hypothesis raises questions about the driving force behind the fixation of the other ITAM-bearing
CEACAM1-related genes in the dog. Most likely, selective
pressure by pathogens changes with time. In times where
the selective pressure exerted by pathogens on a receptor
system is low, Darwinian selection will act and change the
specificity of a receptor now possibly recognizing an
endogenous ligand. Once the receptor has gained a new
function it also can change the signaling properties which
may explain why older i.e. more diverged ITAM-bearing
receptors e.g. like CEACAM24 and CEACAM29 have lost
the ITAM or have gained new splice variants which do not
contain an ITAM.

Conclusion
Taken together, the presence of multiple CEACAM1related dog CEACAMs with ITAMs could reflect a repeated
arms race between species-specific pathogens and the dog
immune system. Fixation and expression by effector cells
of ITAM-containing CEACAMs would result from either
bacterial pathogens binding to CEACAM1 or viruses
which induce the expression of CEACAM1 ligands by
infected cells as found for MCMV. This putatively pathogen-driven evolution of the CEA gene family led to the
development of the CEACAM1/CEACAM28 receptor pair
which could also be involved in the fine tuning of T cell
responses.

Methods
Cells and tissues
Different canine tissue samples were collected from
healthy mix-bread dogs and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and
granulocytes were isolated from blood of healthy mixbread or beagle dogs by density-gradient centrifugation
through Ficoll-Paque (GE Healthcare, Freiburg, Germany). Granulocytes located on top of erythrocytes were
harvested and remaining erythrocytes were lysed (ammonium chloride buffer).

Stimulation of PBMC with PHA (2 µg/ml for 72 hr), CD3
(CA17-2A12;[47]) (0,5 µg/ml for 96 hr) and human IL-2
(200 U/ml for 7 days) was performed at a concentration
of 5 × 105 cells/ml in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10%
fetal calf serum (FCS "Gold"; PAA Laboratories, Coelbe,
Germany), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100
µg/ml streptomycin, non-essential amino acids and 1 mM
sodium pyruvate (GIBCO/Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). T cells were isolated from either stimulated or
unstimulated PBMC by positive MACS sorting following
the manufacturer's instructions (Miltenyi Biotec, Ber-

gisch-Gladbach, Germany). Stimulated and unstimulated
PBMC were incubated with mouse anti-canine CD4
(CA13-1) and rat anti-canine CD8 mAbs (Dog 10-8)[48]
and subsequently with bead-coupled anti-mouse Fc mAb
which also reacts with rat IgG.
Flow cytometric analyses
For surface staining, cells were suspended in PBS/0.3%
(w/v) BSA supplemented with 0.1% (w/v) sodium azide.
Cells were incubated with 0.5 µg/106 cells of the relevant
mAb for 30 min at 4°C. Cells were washed twice and analyzed with a FACScan (BD Biosciences, Mountain View,
CA). Dead cells were excluded by propidium iodide staining. The following reagents and mAbs from Serotec were
used: FITC-conjugated anti-CD3, FITC-conjugated antiCD4 and PE-conjugated anti-CD8α.
Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis
Total RNA extraction was performed using either the TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Karlsruhe, Germany) or the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany)
according to the manufactures' protocols. One µg of total
RNA was used for cDNA synthesis by reverse transcription
(RT) in a total volume of 20 µl using either the Reverse
Transcription System® (Promega, Mannheim, Germany)
or the First-Strand cDNA Synthesis® Kit (MBI Fermentas,
St. Leon-Rot, Germany). The RT product (1 µl) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with Taq
polymerase (Qiagen). After an initial denaturation step at
95°C for 45 s, 35 PCR cycles (denaturation: 95°C, 30 s;
annealing: 60°C, 1 min; extension: 72°C, 1.5 min) and a
final extension step at 72°C for 15 min were performed.
The primers were designed using the Primer3 software.
Gene-specific primers were selected that exhibited > 2
mismatches at the 3'-end of the oligonucleotide to all
other members of the canine CEACAM family, except for
CEACAM28 and CEACAM30 (see below). The primers
were validated by eye using multiple nucleotide sequence
alignments of the aforementioned CEA family members.
The primer sequence and the predicted sizes of the amplified products are summarized in Table 3. Canine GAPDH
cDNA was amplified using GAPDH.dogforward 5'GCCAAAAGGGTCATCATCTC and GAPDH.dog reverse
5'-GCCCATCCACAGTCTTCT primers at a annealing temperature of 56°C and 30 cycles. Eight µl of each PCR were
analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1.8 % agarose gel and
visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The amount of
cDNA was quantified by endpoint determination with the
Quantity 1® software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Munich, Germany).
Cloning and sequence determination of dog CEACAM1
and related cDNAs
Based on published genomic sequences and comparison
with human CEACAM1 the 5'- and the 3'-untranslated

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/196

regions of canine CEACAM1 were predicted and used to
design primers for amplification of full length cDNA
(CEACAM1cf-5i and CEACAM1cf-3i; Table 3). These
primers introduced HindIII and XbaI restriction sites at the
5'- and 3'-ends of the PCR products, respectively. PCR was
performed with cDNA from dog liver using Pfu DNA
polymerase according to the protocol supplied by the
manufacturer. After electrophoretic separation, 6 distinct
ethidium bromide-stained DNA fragments were excised
from the agarose gel and purified using the Perfectprep®
Gel Cleanup Kit (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). The
full length cDNAs were digested with HindIII and XbaI
and cloned into the pRc/CMV expression vector. Plasmid
DNA isolated from 12 clones were analyzed by PCR and
sequencing. Full length cDNAs of CEACAM23,
CEACAM24, CEACAM25, CEACAM28 and CEACAM30
were cloned using the TOPO TA Cloning® Kit (Invitrogen
Life Technologies). PCR was performed with cDNA from
dog spleen using Taq polymerase (Qiagen) and the
CfCEACAM1-5i-f forward primer for all CEACAMs combined with gene-specific reverse primers from the 3'untranslated regions (UTR; Table 3).
Biocomputing
Sequence similarity searches were performed using the
NCBI BLAST tools [49] and Ensembl BLAST/SSAHA
search programs[50]. For the identification of CEACAM
genes not yet annotated in the dog genome, sequences
from human and mouse CEACAM and PSG cDNAs were
run against the WGS databases or whole genome
sequences. Multiple sequence alignments were performed
and phylogenetic trees were constructed with ClustalW[51] using default parameters.

The three dimensional structures of CEACAM N domains
were modeled using the Geno3D-release 2 software based
on the published crystal structure of the murine
CEACAM1 N-A2 fragment[37,52]. Leader and transmembrane domains were identified with the aid of programs
SignalP and TMHMM, respectively. The NetPhos 2.0
server was used to produce neural network predictions for
serine, threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation sites in
the cytoplasmic domains of canine CEACAMs[53]. Comparison of the number of nonsynonymous substitutions
per nonsynonymous site (Ka) with the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (Ks) was performed with the Ka/Ks Calculation Tool [54]. The
substitution rate ratio Ka/Ks measures the molecular
selective pressure. If Ka/Ks = 1, the amino acid changes are
neutral and will be fixed at the same rate as silent mutations. If Ka/Ks < 1, the amino acid changes are deleterious
and purifying selection will reduce the fixation rate. If Ka/
Ks > 1, the amino acid changes are evolutionarily advantageous and positive selection will increase the fixation
rate.
