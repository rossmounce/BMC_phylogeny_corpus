Abstract
Background: The plant hormone auxin directs many aspects of plant growth and development.
To understand the evolution of auxin signalling, we compared the genes encoding two families of
crucial transcriptional regulators, AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR (ARF) and AUXIN/INDOLE-3-ACETIC
ACID (Aux/IAA), among flowering plants and two non-seed plants, Physcomitrella patens and
Selaginella moellendorffii.
Results: Comparative analysis of the P. patens, S. moellendorffii and Arabidopsis thaliana genomes
suggests that the well-established rapid transcriptional response to auxin of flowering plants,
evolved in vascular plants after their divergence from the last common ancestor shared with
mosses. An N-terminally truncated ARF transcriptional activator is encoded by the genomes of P.
patens and S. moellendorffii, and suggests a supplementary mechanism of nuclear auxin signalling,
absent in flowering plants. Site-specific analyses of positive Darwinian selection revealed relatively
high rates of synonymous substitution in the A. thaliana ARFs of classes IIa (and their closest
orthologous genes in poplar) and Ib, suggesting that neofunctionalization in important functional
regions has driven the evolution of auxin signalling in flowering plants. Primary auxin responsive
gene families (GH3, SAUR, LBD) show different phylogenetic profiles in P. patens, S. moellendorffii
and flowering plants, highlighting genes for further study.
Conclusion: The genome of P. patens encodes all of the basic components necessary for a rapid
auxin response. The spatial separation of the Q-rich activator domain and DNA-binding domain
suggests an alternative mechanism of transcriptional control in P. patens distinct from the
mechanism seen in flowering plants. Significantly, the genome of S. moellendorffii is predicted to
encode proteins suitable for both methods of regulation.

Background
The evolution of signal transduction pathways since the
divergence of plants and animals has been influenced by

very different selection pressures. Hormone signalling,
though analogous in both kingdoms, differs in the signalling molecules employed as well as in their perception

and mode of action. Plants are adapted to a sessile lifestyle, being able continuously to form new organs during
their postembryonic development. This process, in addition to embryonic development, is closely associated with
specific growth regulators, effective at low concentrations.
The signalling pathways of these growth regulators (also
known as phytohormones) are relatively well understood,
but their evolution, as well as their relationship to the evolution of embryonic and post-embryonic development in
the plant kingdom, is less clear [1].
Auxin, one such phytohormone, is a principal regulator of
growth and development in flowering plants [2], quickly
triggering the transcription of auxin-responsive genes
[3,4]. Proteins of two related families, AUXIN RESPONSIVE FACTOR (ARF) and AUXIN/INDOLE-3-ACETIC
ACID (Aux/IAA), act together to regulate this transcription
[5,6]. In flowering plants, ARF proteins possess a conserved DNA-binding domain which recognizes auxin
responsive elements (AuxREs): short motifs which are
found in the promoter sequences of many auxin-responsive genes [7,8]. Most ARFs, and all Aux/IAAs also contain
a conserved dimerization domain which mediates protein-protein interactions within and between both protein
families [9,10]. The middle region which joins ARF DNAbinding and dimerization domains is highly divergent
and may be glutamine (Q) rich [11]. Those ARFs which
contain such Q-rich regions are thought to be activators of
gene transcription [11,12]. Conversely, those ARFs which
repress gene transcription lack glutamine (or in one case
methionine) -rich regions.
The N-terminal region of Aux/IAA proteins contains two
other domains: domain I and II. Domain I contains a
short amphiphilic repression motif, which binds to the
co-repressor TOPLESS, enabling Aux/IAAs to repress ARF
function [13,14]. Domain II contains a degron: a motif
sufficient to signal Aux/IAAs for proteasome-mediated
degradation [6,15,16]. Specific point mutations in
domain II confer strong, auxin insensitive phenotypes
[17].
At low cellular auxin concentrations, Aux/IAA proteins
dimerize with ARF transcriptional activators, repressing
their activity [18]. Auxin itself can bind at the interface of
Aux/IAA proteins and TIR1-family F-box proteins, components of specific SCF E3 ubiquitin ligases, directly promoting their interaction. Accordingly, at high cellular auxin
concentrations, Aux/IAAs are ubiquitinated and subsequently degraded [19-21]. Degradation of Aux/IAA proteins then allows ARF-mediated, auxin-dependent gene
transcription.
Physcomitrella patens (a moss), Selaginella moellendorffii (a
vascular non-seed plant) and angiosperms diverged from

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/126

each other at between 700 and 450 million years ago [22].
The genomes of both P. patens and S. moellendorffii encode
all the proteins necessary for this primary auxin response
[23,24]. Furthermore, P. patens has been shown to both
synthesize auxin, and respond to exogenously applied
auxin [25,26]. Here we use the complete genomic
sequences of P. patens and S. moellendorffii to address how
a relatively simple signalling mechanism has evolved into,
in flowering plants, a central regulator of many essential
and diverse developmental processes. A driving force of
this evolution has been positive Darwinian selection.
Such positive selection is a measure of the adaptation of
amino acid sequences following a gene duplication event.
The unambiguous indicator of positive selection, a high
ratio of non-synonymous (dN) to synonymous (dS)
nucleotide substitutions, was detected in the flowering
plant ARFs.
Based on a comparative analysis of the fully-sequenced
genomes of P. patens, S. moellendorffii, and selected flowering plants, we are able to draw conclusions about ancestral auxin target genes and signalling mechanisms, and
about the pressures which have driven the radiation of
auxin-signalling genes in flowering plants.

Results and discussion
Endogenous auxin is a widely used signalling molecule in
vascular plants, but is also found in bryophytes, algae and
prokaryotes [25]. In the present study, we identify similarities and differences between the auxin signalling components in moss and flowering plants by comparing the fully
sequenced genomes of P. patens with those of model flowering plant species. Additional support, where appropriate, is drawn from the genome of S. moellendorffii, a
vascular non-seed plant. Here we present an analysis of
two gene families central to auxin signalling: the ARFs,
encoding transcription factors, and Aux/IAAs, encoding
their repressors. We also analyze three families of primary
auxin responsive genes, which are among the first targets
of auxin-induced transcription in flowering plants.
Aux/IAA
The P. patens genome encodes three Aux/IAA proteins
(PpAux/IAA) (Figure 1). These proteins, at between 484
and 503 amino acids, are significantly longer than all 29
A. thaliana Aux/IAA (AtAux/IAA) family members (the
longest of which, IAA9, consists of 338 amino acids). The
three Aux/IAAs of S. moellendorffii vary in length between
170 and 421 amino acids. Aux/IAA proteins typically
comprise four domains: domain I confers the proteins'
transcriptional repressor function, domain II is a degradation motif, and domains III and IV form a protein dimerization domain, evolutionarily related to the C-terminal
dimerization (CTD) domain of ARF proteins.

which contain no apparent functional domain I motif.
These proteins may function as competitive regulators of
the auxin response. Gaining empirical functional evidence on these proteins will allow hypotheses on their
evolution to be tested.

Phylogenetic relationship of A. thaliana, S. moellendorffii and P. patens Aux/IAA proteins (Bayesian
inference). The presence of the domain I motif is marked.

Domain I
In all but one Arabidopsis Aux/IAA protein, domain I contains a sequence of amino acids reminiscent of an ERFassociated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motif. This
LxLxL domain I motif interacts directly with TOPLESS
(TPL), a transcriptional co-repressor. This interaction
leads to a repression of the ARF-dependent transcription
of a reporter gene driven by the DR5 promoter, a synthetic
auxin-sensitive marker containing repeated TGTCTC
auxin response elements (AuxREs) [13,14].

PpAux/IAAs do not contain an LxLxL motif in domain I.
Instead they all contain a similar LxLxPP motif (Figure 1,
Additional file 1). A corresponding and overlapping LxLxLxPP motif was found in three AtAux/IAAs (IAA18, 26 and
28), forming a cluster with good bootstrap support (Figure 1, Additional file 1). The genome of S. moellendorffii
encodes three Aux/IAA proteins, one of which contains an
LxLxPP motif in domain I. The other two contain the
LxLxL motif typical of flowering plants (Figure 1, Additional file 1). The genes containing LxLxL motifs found in
domain I of S. moellendorffii and flowering plants do not
form monophyletic groups. Therefore the motif is likely
to have become established at least twice in each lineage.
Of the 35 Aux/IAAs encoded by the Populus trichocarpa
genome, 27 are predicted to contain an LxLxL motif and
six an LxLxPP motif [27]. In rice, it is predicted that 27 out
of 33 Aux/IAAs contain an LxLxL motif; of these, two contain an LxLxLxPP motif. In rice, one Aux/IAA contains
LxLxPP (Table 1). At present, there is no evidence that this
LxLxPP motif, in any species, represents a functional
repression domain. There are also no experimental data
available which test the role of flowering plant Aux/IAAs

There is one homologous position for the EAR-like motif
of domain I. Based on the alignment of A. thaliana, S. moellendorffii and P. patens Aux/IAAs (Additional file 1) this
domain I motif can be expanded to LXL [A, G] [L, P] [P, G,
S, T]. This allows the detection of domain I in all
sequences tested of these three species. If expanded further, an [L, I]X [L, I] [A, G] [L, P] [P, G, S, T] motif can,
according to our present knowledge, be used to detect
domain I in all land plant Aux/IAAs. This analysis does
not preclude the possibility that other non-homologous
domains serving a similar function are also present.
Mutations in the leucine positions of the domain I motif
of Arabidopsis have been shown to result in significantly
weaker repression of ARF-mediated transcription to Aux/
IAA proteins [14]. Nevertheless, the widespread conservation of the LxLxPP sequence suggests it is a functional
motif. The predicted presence in P. patens of two TPL-like
transcriptional co-repressors (Additional file 2) also suggests the LxLxPP motif is able to inhibit (at least to some
extent) ARF-mediated transcription. In flowering plants,
however, the LxLxPP sequence appears to have been
superseded by the LxLxL domain (Additional file 1).
Notably, the genome of S. moellendorffii encodes proteins
predicted to contain both motifs. Although the relative
efficiency of domain I-dependent transcriptional repression in non-seed plants (via the LxLxPP motif) and flowering plants (via the LxLxL motif) is not possible to assess
with the data that are currently available, it is highly significant, as they would be expected profoundly to influence the role of auxin-dependent transcriptional
activation.
Domain II
The alignment of domain II from several Aux/IAA proteins indicates that not all 13 amino acids of the consensus sequence, which in flowering plants mediate the
specific proteasomal degradation of Aux/IAAs in response
to auxin, are faithfully conserved (Additional file 3). Nevertheless, a central core of five residues, representing
amino acids 4–8 (GWPPV), is required for targeted protein degradation [16]. Though not sufficient to confer protein instability to a luciferase reporter fusion on its own,
the functionally essential central motif (which can be represented by VGWPP [L, V, I]) is conserved in all Aux/IAAs,
including those from P. patens and S. moellendorffii (Additional file 3).

* The number of ARFs and Aux/IAAs from Kalluri et al. [27] is shown in brackets.
** In addition, one A. thaliana ARF, ARF5, has a methionine-rich middle region.

Aux/IAAs are degraded after domain II binds to the TIR1
family of F-box proteins [19-21]. The presence of the core
motif of domain II and four paralogs of the Aux/IAA-specific TIR1 family of F-box proteins (Additional file 4) in P.
patens, suggests that PpAux/IAAs are degraded in an auxindependent manner. Homology modelling has shown that
the auxin binding pocket of PpTIR1 is intact [26].
Together, these data suggest that auxin-mediated targeted
protein degradation is relevant in P. patens, and that the
relatively slow response of P. patens to auxin [28,29] is not
due to an impaired ability to degrade Aux/IAAs in
response to auxin.
Diversification of Aux/IAA
The dramatic radiation of Aux/IAA genes in land plants
(from three in P. patens to 29 in A. thaliana, 35 in P. trichocarpa and 33 O. sativa) (Figure 1, Table 1) underpins a
corresponding increase in the complexity of auxin signalling. After the separation of lycophytes and seed plants,
the Aux/IAA family in the A. thaliana lineage was
expanded by 25 additional duplication events (Additional
file 5). To test whether this radiation has been driven by
neofunctionalization at the amino acid level (for example
in response to specific changes in ARF protein structures),
rates of positive selection were measured [30]. Specifically, we applied a likelihood ratio test (LRT) to selected
Aux/IAA sub-families of A. thaliana and P. trichocarpa, and
compared data fits to two models: M1 vs. M2 and M7 vs.
M8 (Table 2; Additional file 6, A). A comparison of these
models measures the likelihood that differences in nonsynonomous/synonomous substitution ratios happened
by chance. For Aux/IAA proteins, no significant differences between test and null hypotheses were found in any
of the data sets tested.

Aux/IAA genes have been retained in the A. thaliana
genome at a high rate. A two-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) test of microarray data has previously shown
that the gene expression patterns of Aux/IAA sister pairs of
A. thaliana are significantly different [31]. We extended
this analysis by widening the conditions tested. Two-way
ANOVA results for ten pairs of Aux/IAA genes are reported
as graphs of expression levels at 63 conditions in Additional file 7, A–J (after [32]). All ten sister pairs of Aux/IAA
showed significant gene (G), sample (S), and gene by
sample (GxS) effects (Additional file 7, A–J).
Aux/IAA genes have radiated through segmental duplication events [33]. In P. trichocarpa and O. sativa, both ARF
and Aux/IAA gene families have been expanded, also
largely due to segmental duplication [27,34,35]. After
such events, the gradual appearance of deleterious mutations generally leads to the loss of one of the duplicated
genes [36]. If both gene copies are retained, there is a
higher probability that mutations leading to a split in the
expression pattern of the ancestral gene between duplicated genes, rather than mutations that lead to a new function in one copy, have occurred [37]. Such a split can
occur through changes in transcription-factor binding
sites within promoter regions that result in differential
expression of the two gene copies. We therefore conclude
that changes in expression pattern have driven Aux/IAA
radiation. Indeed, when compared to amino acid substitution rates, changes in expression pattern contribute
more to Aux/IAA function [38,39]. Studies in P. trichocarpa [27] also showed that genes of the expanded
PtIAA3 subgroup, which is represented by six members,
are differentially transcribed. These data lend further support to the hypothesis that the diversification of Aux/IAA

family members in flowering plants has been sustained by
changes in their expression patterns.

llendorffii- and P. patens-specific subclasses are not
monophyletic.

ARF
In A. thaliana, all ARFs contain a DNA binding domain,
but some lack a C-terminal dimerization domain (CTD).
The genomes of S. moellendorffii and P. patens also encode
ARFs with C-terminal truncations, as well as those with Nterminal truncations. All of these variants are discussed
below.

In addition, P. patens and S. moellendorffii each encode one
C-terminally truncated ARF with no CTD (Figure 2, Figure
3, Table 1). Flowering plants encode more CTD-truncated
ARFs. This trend is seen in A. thaliana (4 out of 23 ARFs),
O. sativa (6 out of 25 ARFs) and P. trichocarpa (6 out of 39
ARFs) (Table 1). Diversification of CTD-truncated ARFs in
flowering plants suggests a role for auxin-independent
regulation of auxin responsive genes.

Full-length and C-terminally truncated ARFs
To examine evolutionary relationships among P. patens
(PpARF), S. moellendorffii (SmARF) and A. thaliana
(AtARF) ARF proteins, a rooted phylogenetic tree was constructed from the alignment of the predicted protein
sequences of the 12 PpARFs, the 7 SmARFs and the 23
AtARFs predicted to contain a DNA binding domain
(DBD). All 42 ARF genes analysed could be grouped into
five major classes (Figure 2). In addition to the five previously described classes of ARFs [35], we detected an additional cluster of four P. patens genes and one cluster of two
S. moellendorffii genes, each with good bootstrap support.
Six PpARFs are similar to subclass IIa (AtARF5-8 and 19)
and two are similar to class III (AtARF10, 16 and 17).
PpARFs, therefore, fell into one of three classes (Figure 2).
As in P. patens, S. moellendorffii has representatives of subclass IIa (three genes) and class III (two genes). The S. moe-

Full-length ARF transcriptional activators
In A. thaliana, the first transcriptional response to exogenously applied auxin is a rapid up-regulation of auxinresponsive genes [4]. The so-called middle regions (MRs)
of five AtARFs of sub-class IIa (AtARFs 5, 6, 7, 8 and 19)
mediate this transcription [11]. All five of these MRs (as
defined by the region between the CTD and DBD) are significantly longer than those of all other ARFs, with the
exception of AtARF2 [40]. PpARFs and SmARFs of class IIa
also contain an extended MR (Additional file 8 and 9). A
second feature of the MRs of those AtARFs which function
as transcriptional activators is a relatively high proportion
of glutamine residues (except for AtARF5) (Additional file
9 and 10). The MRs of canonical PpARFs of this group
contain fewer glutamine residues than their vascular plant
counterparts at between 7.8 and 10% of all amino acid
residues, compared to between 17.1 and 22.3 for the Q-

rich ARFs of A. thaliana. PpARFs are unidentifiable as Qrich both by the normalized amino acid frequency used
for Additional file 10 and by a PROSITE domain search.
Nevertheless, these MRs all contain a higher proportion of
glutamine residues than all but two of the repressor
AtARFs (Additional file 9). Given the character states of
the MR length (Additional file 8) and glutamine content
(Additional file 10) in the phylogenetic tree, a single gain
of the domain (basal to the cluster starting with AtARF7
and 19) seems to have occurred. The MR seems to have
been
secondarily
reduced
in
one
SmARF
(Selmo1_2_438333) and secondarily expanded in
AtARF2. The subsequent enrichment of the MR with
glutamine residues apparently evolved several times independently within the genes containing the prolonged MR.
S. moellendorffii contains three class IIa canonical ARF
transcriptional activators. These proteins all contain an
extended, Q-rich MR. The simultaneous appearance of an
LxLxL motif in S. moellendorffii Aux/IAAs allows the possibility that this motif co-evolved with the appearance of
canonical Q-rich ARFs.
The exogenous application of auxin to P. patens has been
shown to have only a weak effect on the expression of
transgenic flowering plant auxin-responsive markers
[28,29,41]. In contrast, auxin-responsive transcription in
A. thaliana is observed rapidly, and at relatively low auxin
concentrations [4,42]. The slower response in P. patens
could be due to a number of reasons relating either to an
inability of the moss to recognize auxin-responsive flowering plant promoter elements, or to a slower auxin
response in P. patens per se. Direct experimental evidence
is needed if we are to state firmly that there is indeed a
slower auxin response in P. patens, and that this is due to
a relatively weak activation of gene transcription by ARFs.
However, the observations that i) the LxLxPP motif of
Aux/IAA domain I has been gradually replaced by an
LxLxL motif in most flowering plants Aux/IAAs, ii) Q-rich
ARFs and the LxLxL EAR-like domain appear together in S.
moellendorffii, iii) mutations in the canonical LxLxL motif
confer weaker transcriptional repression in A. thaliana
[14], and iv) there is a relatively slow transcriptional
response of P. patens to auxin together lead us to hypothesize that the Q-enriched subclass IIa ARFs of P. patens are
moderate rather than strong transcriptional activators.
N-terminally truncated ARFs are candidate trans-acting ARF
regulators
Two proteins encoded by the P. patens genome,
Phypa_171888 and Phypa_170581, contain both a CTD
and an extended Q-rich MR (at 14.0 and 14.5% Q) (Figure 3, 4). However, neither protein contains a recognizable DNA-binding domain (DBD); both gene models were
manually checked for accuracy. This phylogenetic analysis
placed both truncated P. patens proteins in class IIa with

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/126

AtARF transcriptional activators 6, 7, 19, 5 and 8. The
genome of S. moellendorffii also encodes two DBD-truncated ARFs in a monophyletic group with N-terminally
truncated P. patens ARFs. Artificially truncated AtARF5, 6,
7 and 8 proteins (with their DNA-binding domains
removed) have previously been shown to activate strongly
(15- to 20-fold) transcription of an auxin-responsive
reporter gene by dimerizing with canonical ARFs [11].
Therefore, it is possible that the activation of an auxin
response in P. patens could be relayed by a CTD-dependent heterodimerization between a DBD-truncated ARF
and a canonical ARF (Figure 5[1]).
The presence of DBD-truncated Q-rich ARFs allows an
alternative transcriptional control, alongside the evolution of a functional motif in domain I of Aux/IAAs. Such
an N-terminal truncation enables the spatial separation of
transcription-activating MRs and DBDs by the competitive inhibition of ARF CTDs by Aux/IAAs (Figure 5[1]). A
functional domain I-motif would not be necessary for
such inhibition. Since such an inhibitory mechanism is
not able to separate the DNA-binding and activation
domains present in a single ARF, we hypothesize that a
strong selection pressure on domain I of Aux/IAAs for the
efficient recruitment of transcriptional co-repressors
could have been a feature of Aux/IAA evolution after the
appearance of canonical Q-rich ARFs. This hypothesis
would predict that at least two mechanisms have evolved
through which the evolution of a strong ARF activation
domain has been accommodated: firstly, the appearance
of a strong Aux/IAA repressor domain, as seen in flowering plants, and secondly, the spatial separation of the ARF
activation domain from the DNA-binding domain, as
seen in P. patens. Notably, S. moellendorffii is predicted to
employ both.
A second group of proteins with an N-terminal truncation
is encoded by the genomes of P. patens and S. moellendorffii (Table 1, Figure 3, Figure 5[2]). Here the truncation is
larger, and the encoded proteins are predicted to have neither a DBD-domain, nor a middle region. We propose
that proteins of this group act as auxin-independent competitive inhibitors of ARF dimerization, inhibiting both
potentiation (via ARF-ARF dimerization) and repression
(via ARF-Aux/IAA dimerization) of the auxin response.
Evolution of ARF activators
To test whether positive selection, and therefore possible
neofunctionalization, has driven evolution within the
extended ARF MR of class IIa, we compared the relative
rates of synonymous and non-synonomous substitutions
in full-length coding sequences from all ARFs of two fullysequenced dicotyledonous species: A. thaliana and P. trichocarpa. A likelihood ratio test (LRT) was applied to
selected ARF sequences from A. thaliana and P. trichocarpa

(MLEs) of parameters under model M2a and M8 are listed
in Table 3, together with the sites inferred to be under positive selection by the Bayes empirical Bayes (BEB)
approach. For node ARF12, both M2a and M8 have significantly higher likelihood values than their corresponding
null models M1a and M7, suggesting the presence of sites
under positive selection. For node ARF7, M8 (but not
M2a) had significantly higher likelihood values than its
corresponding null model M7 (Table 3). Consequently,
this model identified 24 sites under positive selection (21
sites are presented in Additional file 11), all within the
extended MR (Table 3), supporting the hypothesis that

positive selection within the MR plays a role in neofunctionalization, possibly directly influencing the acquisition
of a transcriptional activation function. It is however possible that positive selection influences an unrelated function of the MR. For example, the MR may influence
protein stability, as is the case for the MR of ARF1 [43].
Yet, if the enrichment of glutamine is important for transcriptional activation, the fact that 14 of the 24 sites under
positive selection in the MR encode a glutamine in at least
one protein clearly argues for the involvement of positive
selection in the acquisition of that particular function.

ARF7 and ARF19 dimerize with Aux/IAAs to regulate the
expression of partially overlapping sets of auxin-responsive genes in the control of lateral root development and
gravitropism [44]. However, ARFs do not only dimerize
with Aux/IAAs. In Arabidopsis, a member of a second
class of transcription factors, MYB77, interacts with the
CTD ARF7 to control auxin-responsive gene expression
and lateral root number [45]. Therefore a third interaction, besides DNA or Aux/IAA interaction, influences ARF
evolution. As the interaction between MYB77 and ARFs
occurs with the ARF CTD, it cannot explain positive selection within the proteins' MR. It does, however, represent
a precedent for Aux/IAA independent protein-protein
interactions (and possible subsequent post-translational
modification) influencing protein function within the
ARF7 node, and the presence of, as yet unconsidered, evolutionary pressures influencing ARF function.
Evolution of ARFs which lack a Q-rich middle region
In contrast to the relatively constant numbers of class IIa
ARF transcriptional activators encoded by the genomes of
P. patens, S. moellendorffii and A. thaliana (six, three and
five respectively), the number of ARF repressors has
increased from five and four in P. patens and S. moellendorffii to fourteen in A. thaliana. There is only one P. patens-specific and one S. moellendorffii-specific ARF class,
whilst there are three flowering plant-specific sub-classes
(class Ia, class Ib and class IIb) indicating that evolution
within flowering plants has favoured strongly the diversification of auxin-regulated repressor ARFs (Figure 2).

Two polyphyletic groups of ARF lacking a Q-rich region
can be differentiated: those with a CTD and those without. This suggests at least two distinct mechanisms of tran-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/126

scriptional regulation. ARFs which lack a CTD are
responsible for the auxin-independent (or basal) regulation of auxin-responsive genes (Figure 5[4]). These ARFs
cannot interact with Aux/IAAs and therefore their transcriptional activity is independent of cellular auxin concentration. However, identity within their DNA-binding
domain suggests they are able to bind to auxin responsive
promoter elements. The second type of ARF has a CTD
and is, at least according to the accepted paradigm, able to
dimerize with Aux/IAAs [9,18,46] (Figure 3, 5[3]). Phosphorylation of ARF2 (a full length ARF) by BIN2, a kinase
involved in brassinosteroid-dependent transcription
decreases its ability to bind DNA [47]. This path for crosstalk between two hormone signalling pathways (auxin
and brassinosteroid) represents a precedent for ARF
repressors to perform in other signalling functions.
After analysis of all genes encoding A. thaliana ARF transcriptional repressors, positive selection was only
observed in the ARF12 node (Class Ib), where little is
known about protein function (Additional file 6, B). In
this class, single knockouts do not show obvious aberrant
phenotypes [44], and the generation of double knockout
lines has been hampered by the genes' close proximity on
chromosome 1.
Class Ib ARFs are absent from the P. trichocarpa and O.
sativa genome, raising the possibility of a specific role
within the order Brassicales [27,35]. Positive selection
does not prove the acquisition of novel and specific function in the class Ib ARFs of A. thaliana. However, together
with the subgroup's rapid and significant diversification,
followed by the retention of duplicated genes, it suggests
neofunctionalization. Any putative new function is also
likely to be related to the amino acid residues under positive selection in the middle region of the protein, possibly
facilitating new protein-protein interactions, protein stability, or post-translational modifications.
Auxin-independent regulation of ARF activity
ARFs without a CTD cannot dimerize with Aux/IAAs and
are therefore not expected to be regulated directly by
auxin. But is auxin-independent ARF signalling relevant to
flowering plants, or is ARF function dependent on a functional CTD? CTD-deficient arf mutants do indeed have
aberrant phenotypes. Four ARF proteins which lack a CTD
are predicted to be encoded by the A. thaliana genome. Of
these, ARF3 mutants show pleiotropic effects in flower
development [48]. Plants expressing a miRNA-resistant
version of a second CTD-deficient ARF, ARF17, have
increased ARF17 mRNA levels and display dramatic developmental defects. These include embryo and emerging
leaf symmetry anomalies, leaf shape defects, premature
inflorescence development, altered phyllotaxy, reduced
petal size, abnormal stamens, sterility, and root growth

Figureof auxin signalling in A. thaliana, S. moellendorffii and P. patens
Model 5
Model of auxin signalling in A. thaliana, S. moellendorffii and P. patens. (1) In P. patens and S. moellendorffii, N-terminally
truncated Q-rich MRs are predicted to dimerise with full length ARFs to mediate transcription in the presence of auxin. In the
absence of auxin, Aux/IAAs inhibit this interaction. Dimirization between other canonical ARFs is also possible. (2) A. thaliana,
S. moellendorffii and P. patens full-length ARFs have a MR that is not Q-rich, which can dimerize with either truncated regulatory
ARFs in an auxin-independent manner (in P. patens and S. moellendorffii), (3) or with Aux/IAAs in an auxin dependent manner (A.
thaliana, S. moellendorffii and P. patens). (4) A. thaliana, S. moellendorffii and P. patens C-terminally truncated ARFs mediate transcription in an auxin-independent manner. (5) A. thaliana and S. moellendorffii ARFs with Q-enrichment in their MR. These ARFs

defects [49]. The search for alternative mechanisms of ARF
regulation has centred on small RNAs. Two P. patens ARF
transcripts (Phypa_159688 and Phypa_171197), both
encoding full-length ARFs (Figure 4), have been identified
as targets of small RNAs [50]. Regulation of ARFs by
miRNA in A. thaliana can be considered as auxin-independent because auxin treatment does not alter appreciably miR160, miR164, and miR167 accumulation, at least in
seedlings [49]. In A. thaliana, mRNAs encoding two out of
the four ARFs which have no CTD have also been identified as targets of small RNAs: ARF3 is the target of
AtTAS3a-c and ARF17 is the target of miR160 [50]. Small
RNAs do not only target transcripts of ARFs without a
CTD, but also Aux/IAA-binding ARFs. The regulation of
ARF activity is therefore complex and involves the integration of auxin-dependent and auxin-independent mechanisms (Figure 5). miRNAs are also potentially important
regulators of cross-talk between auxin and other signalling

pathways, for example between auxin and abscisic acid
[51].
Auxin-independent, cell-dependent regulation of auxin
signalling activity has previously been identified as an
important factor in plant development [52]. Indeed,
endogenous small regulatory RNAs seem to play a relatively important role in the regulation of ARF gene expression [53]. For example, in A. thaliana the expression
pattern of both ARF6 and ARF8 (involved in female and
male reproductive organ development) is controlled by
miR167, with miRNA160 also involved in the control of
ARF expression in P. patens and A. thaliana as well as in S.
moellendorffii, suggesting a conserved mechanism of ARF
post-transcriptional regulation [52,54]. The P. patens
genome encodes a surprisingly diverse population of miRNAs. However, in contrast to ARF and Aux/IAA genes, the

number of miRNAs conserved between P. patens and A.
thaliana is relatively large [55].
Primary auxin response genes
Primary auxin response genes (those genes whose expression is directly regulated by ARFs) can be grouped into
three major families: Aux/IAAs, GH3s and SAURs.
Recently, transcription of certain LOB domain (LBD) genes
has also been shown to be rapidly and specifically up-regulated by auxin [4,56]. All four of these major gene families are represented in the genomes of P. patens and S.
moellendorffii. However, a detailed analysis of their
response to auxin application is precluded by the lack of
global transcriptional data from these species.

Microarray analysis has showed that, in A. thaliana, only
the transcription of group II GH3 genes (which encode
auxin conjugating enzymes) is regulated by auxin [4] Similarly, in O. sativa, the transcription of GH3 genes which
were most strongly up-regulated in response to auxin
treatment also belong to group II [57]. The P. patens
genome contains two genes that are homologous to the
GH3 family of flowering plants. Both conjugate IAA to
amino acids, with PpGH3-2 showing a far broader range
of substrate specificity than PpGH3-1 [58]. Surprisingly,
the moss GH3 genes form a common clade with the group
I genes of A. thaliana, and not with those encoding the
auxin conjugating enzymes of group II. Furthermore, the
clades are separated by a relatively high genetic distance,
suggesting that they diverged a relatively long time ago
(Additional file 12). Auxin application increases tran-

scription of specific flowering plant GH3 genes of group
II. This increase has never been demonstrated in P. patens
[59]. The genome of S. moellendorffii is predicted to
encode one group II GH3 enzyme, and one protein
belonging to group I (Additional file 12). The remaining
19 SmGH3 genes cannot be clearly assigned based on phylogeny. The transcriptional response to auxin of these
genes has never been tested.
P. patens GH3 enzymes are nevertheless able to conjugate
auxin. Direct measurements of auxin conjugates in moss
plants have give valuable insights into the developmental
role of auxin conjugation by GH3s. P. patens plants lacking both GH3 enzymes, when grown on IAA, still conjugate auxin. These results suggest other classes of enzymes
may also conjugate auxin in P. patens [58].
Based on phylogeny P. patens GH3s are more closely
related to GH3-11 of A. thaliana, which catalyses the synthesis of jasmonic acid conjugates [58,60]. P. patens plants
lacking the GH3-2 gene show an increased sensitivity to
high jasmonic acid concentrations, suggesting a potential
role for jasmonic acid conjugation as well for this enzyme
[58]. A broad substrate specificity of GH3-2 in P. patens
could suggest that the enzyme has retained this characteristic from the common ancestor of all land plants.
In flowering plants, SAUR genes are a diverse family of
unknown function with differing responsiveness to auxin
[4]. The P. patens genome contains 18 SAUR genes (A.
thaliana approximately 70), which cluster in two groups

Page 11 of 16
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:126

with low bootstrap support (Additional file 13). All
AtSAUR genes of group A are auxin-responsive [4,62].
This group shows relatively high similarity to nine
PpSAUR genes (albeit with low bootstrap support) (Additional file 13) and therefore could participate in the auxin
response in P. patens. The LOB domain family of transcription factors also contains important auxin-responsive signalling proteins. In P. patens, the LBD gene family has 17
members, forming five clades (Additional file 14). One
clade, encoding four LBDs (Phypa_18666, 7278, 25219
and 48669), is monophyletic with important auxinresponsive regulators of lateral root formation in A. thaliana, LBD16 and 29 [56], and therefore represents candidates for P. patens auxin primary response, an attractive
target for future research.

Conclusion
It is clear that auxin signalling is responsible for many
aspects of vascular plant growth and development. In this
manuscript, we demonstrate that the genome of P. patens
encodes all of the basic components necessary for an
auxin response. We also suggest that the evolution of an
alternative, competitive mechanism of transcriptional
control in P. patens, involving the truncation of ARF transcriptional activators, substitutes for a mechanism which,
in S. moellendorffii and flowering plants, confers a rapid
auxin response.
However, without a systematic analysis of the auxin transcriptional response in P. patens and S. moellendorffii it
remains difficult to assess (i) whether these plants are
capable of rapidly synthesizing specific mRNAs in
response to auxin in the same manner as flowering plants,
and (ii) the role any such response plays in auxin homeostasis and plant development.
It is, however, clear that an expansion of the Aux/IAA gene
family accounts for much of the diversification of auxin
signalling proteins in flowering plants. Furthermore, the
smaller size of many gene families relevant to auxin signalling in P. patens is probably correlated to the lower
structural complexity of this plant. This correlation is
especially pronounced in Aux/IAA gene families.
Auxin and its polar transport are crucial factors in flowering plant development, and have come to direct many
processes which are not relevant to mosses such as apical
dominance, formation and maintenance of shoot and
root apical meristems and vascular differentiation. Mosses
nevertheless require auxin for cell differentiation and division. Understanding the differences in the underlying
mechanisms of auxin signalling, which drive these different physiological processes, and of their evolutionary relationship, will be a fascinating challenge for the future.

Domain annotation and multiple sequence alignments
Protein domain architectures of the ARF and Aux/IAA candidate hits were annotated using the Pfam [64] Hidden
Markov Profiles (HMMs) PF02362.12 (B3, representing
the DBD), PF06507.4 (Auxin_resp), PF02309.7
(AUX_IAA, representing the CTD) and the PROSITE [65]
profile PS50962 (IAA_ARF) using the hmmpfam and the
ps_scan tools and applying each domain profile's "trusted
cutoff" as filtering criteria. To extract CTD domain region
from both, ARFs and Aux/IAAs (CTD+), the FASTA output
option of ps_scan was used. CTD+ domain sequences
were aligned with MAFFT L-INSI [66], ProbCons, Muscle
and T-coffee and subsequently combined into an optimal
alignment using the combiner function of T-coffee [67].
Full-length multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) were
calculated using Dialign [68]. Full-length MSAs including
the protein domain annotation were visualized and manually inspected and curated using the Jalview [69] alignment editor. In order to generate data for the domainbased phylogenies, the full-length MSAs were clipped to
either the N-terminal DNA-binding (DBD; extending the
B3 + Aux_resp domain matches) or the C-terminal interaction domain (CTD; extending the Aux_IAA domain
matches) regions, according to the domain annotation
and alignment quality. Proteins missing both individual
domains were discarded and the clipped MSAs were realigned using the MAFFT [66] L-INSI algorithm.

Bayesian inference was performed using MrBayes for the
clipped Aux/IAA and the CTD+ MSA with 2 runs with a
mixed model prior, a proportion of invariable sites and
gamma distribution for a maximum of 2,000,000 using a
temperature of 0.2 and a sampling rate of 5. Maximum
Likelihood (ML) and Neighbor Joining (NJ) phylogenies
were calculated for the full-length Aux/IAA MSA and the
clipped MSAs for the DBD, the ARF-specific CTD and the
CTD including the Aux/IAAs (CTD+). Bootstrapped
(100×) NJ trees were calculated using a modified version
of the quicktree software [70], with the Scoredist [71]
matrix. ProtTest [72] was used to select the most appropriate evolutionary model for ML inference (DBD:JTT+G;
CTD:JTT+G; Aux/IAA:JTT+G+F). Bootstrapped (100×)
best-known likelihood topologies were calculated using
the parallelized version of RAxML [73]. Generally, phylogenetic trees were rooted by midpoint-rooting. The CTD,
as the common feature of both families, was used to root

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/126

the ARF and AUX/IAA trees. To infer the history of duplications and losses, the CTD+ phylogeny was reconciled
with Notung [74], as used in [75-77] applying the species
tree (Phypa, (Selmo, Arath)).
Character state analyses
The MR was defined as the region between DBD and CTD,
or in case of a lack of the DBD as the region from the Nterminus to the start of the CTD. The length of the MR was
transformed into a continuous character matrix comprising eight characters. Q-rich regions were represented by
the amino acid frequency normalized to the length of the
MR. The resulting character matrix was analyzed using the
Mesquite [78] analysis tool "Trace Character History" on
the basis of the Notung reconciled CTD+ MrBayes phylogeny. Nucleotide alignments of coding sequences were performed on the basis of protein alignments. The protein
sequences were aligned with MAFFT [69]. DAMBE 4.5.55
[79] was used to translate protein alignments to nucleotide alignments.
Statistical tests for positive selection
We applied the codon-based substitution model of Yang
et al. [80] to identify amino acid sites under positive selection using PAML3.14 [81]. First, we ran a test for the existence of sites with a dN/dS ratio > 1 by using a likelihood
ratio test (LRT) to compare null models M1a and
M7(beta) (that do not allow for sites with dN/dS >1) with
alternative models M2a (PositiveSelection) and
M8(beta&ω). If the LRT difference was statistically significant we identified the sites that were under positive selection. Naïve empirical Bayes (NEB) and Bayes empirical
Bayes (BEB) approaches were used [82] to calculate the
posterior probability that each site belongs to a particular
site class. Sites with high posterior probabilities from the
class with ω>1 were inferred to be under positive selection.
Microarray experiments
The microarray gene expression data for paralogous pairs
of Aux/IAA genes were analyzed in 63 diverse samples [32]
(in our analysis, we included only data generated from
wild type plants). gcRMA normalized data were used [32].
Three biological replications were used to generate the
data sets. To identify which components contribute to
expression pattern divergence within each duplicate pair,
the two-way ANOVA used by Duarte et al. [31] to partition the gene (G), sample (S), and gene by sample interaction (GxS) effects was extended to all 63 microarray
samples. Analysis was done using Statistica 5.0.
