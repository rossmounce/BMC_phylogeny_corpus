Conclusion: These observations imply that members of the Ub family had already formed strong
functional associations with E1-like proteins, UBC/E2-related proteins, and JAB peptidases in the
bacteria. Several of these Ub-like proteins and the associated protein families are likely to function
together in signaling systems just as in eukaryotes.

interactions

Results: We systematically analyzed prokaryotic Ub-related β-grasp fold proteins using sensitive
sequence profile searches and structural analysis. Consequently, we identified novel Ub-related
proteins beyond the characterized ThiS, MoaD, TGS, and YukD domains. To understand their
functional associations, we sought and recovered several conserved gene neighborhoods and
domain architectures. These included novel associations involving diverse sulfur metabolism
proteins, siderophore biosynthesis and the gene encoding the transfer mRNA binding protein
SmpB, as well as domain fusions between Ub-like domains and PIN-domain related RNAses. Most
strikingly, we found conserved gene neighborhoods in phylogenetically diverse bacteria combining
genes for JAB domains (the primary de-ubiquitinating isopeptidases of the proteasomal complex),
along with E1-like adenylating enzymes and different Ub-related proteins. Further sequence analysis
of other conserved genes in these neighborhoods revealed several Ub-conjugating enzyme/E2ligase related proteins. Genes for an Ub-like protein and a JAB domain peptidase were also found
in the tail assembly gene cluster of certain caudate bacteriophages.

Background: Ubiquitin (Ub)-mediated signaling is one of the hallmarks of all eukaryotes.
Prokaryotic homologs of Ub (ThiS and MoaD) and E1 ligases have been studied in relation to sulfur
incorporation reactions in thiamine and molybdenum/tungsten cofactor biosynthesis. However,
there is no evidence for entire protein modification systems with Ub-like proteins and
deconjugation by deubiquitinating enzymes in prokaryotes. Hence, the evolutionary assembly of the
eukaryotic Ub-signaling apparatus remains unclear.

Background

Volume 7, Issue 7, Article R60

Iyer et al.

The ubiquitin (Ub) system is one of the most remarkable protein modification systems of eukaryotes, which appears to
distinguish them from model prokaryotic systems. The modification of proteins by Ub or related polypeptides (Ubls) has
been detected in all eukaryotes studied to date and is comprised of conserved machineries that both add Ub and
remove it [1,2]. The Ub-conjugating system consists of a
three-step cascade beginning with an E1 enzyme that uses
ATP to adenylate the terminal carboxylate of Ub/Ubl and
subsequently transfers this adenylated intermediate to a conserved internal cysteine in the form of a thioester linkage. The
E1 enzyme then transfers this cysteine-linked Ub to the conserved cysteine of the E2 enzyme, which is the next enzyme in
the cascade. Finally, the E2 enzyme transfers the Ub/Ubl to

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/7/R60

the target polypeptide with the help of an E3 enzyme [1,3].
The E3 enzymes of the HECT domain superfamily contain a
conserved internal cysteine, which accepts the Ub/Ubl
through a thioester linkage and finally transfers it to the εamino group of a lysine on the target protein. The E3 ligases
of the treble-clef fold, namely the RING and A20 finger superfamilies, appear to facilitate directly the transfer of Ub to the
lysine of target protein, without forming a covalent link with
Ub/Ubl (Figure 1) [4,5].
The proteins modified by ubiquitination might have different
fates depending both on the specific Ub or Ubl used, and the
type of modification they undergo [6,7]. Mono-ubiquitination
and poly-ubiquitination via G76-K63 linkages play regulatory
roles in diverse systems such as signaling cascades,

Results and discussion

deposited research

As a result of this analysis we were able to identify several new
members of the Ub-like fold in prokaryotes as well as functionally associated components such as E1-like enzymes, JAB
hydrolases, and E2-like enzymes, which appear to interact
even in prokaryotes to form novel pathways related to eukaryotic Ub signaling. We not only present evidence that there are
multiple adenylating systems of Ub-related proteins in
prokaryotes, but also we predict intricate pathways using
JAB-like peptidases and E2-like enzymes in the context of
diverse Ub-related proteins.

reports

Homologs of other central components of the eukaryotic Ubsignaling pathway have also been detected in bacteria, such as
the TS-N domain found in prokaryotic translation factors,
which is the precursor of the helical Ub-binding UBA domain
[32-34]. Similarly, members of the papain-like fold, zincinlike metallopeptidases, and the JAB domain superfamilies
are also abundantly represented in prokaryotes [10-16,35].
However, to date there is no reported evidence of functional
interactions of any of the prokaryotic versions of these
domains with endogenous co-occurring counterparts of Ub/
Ubls and their ligases in potential pathways analogous to
eukaryotic Ub signaling. Thus, despite a reasonably clear
understanding of the possible precursors of Ub/Ubls and the
E1 enzymes, the evolutionary process by which the complete
eukaryotic Ub-signaling system as an apparatus for protein
modification was pieced together remains murky. To address
this problem we conducted a systematic comparative
genomic analysis of the Ub-like (also referred to as the βgrasp fold in the SCOP database [36]) fold in prokaryotes to
decipher its early evolutionary radiations. We then utilized
the vast dataset of contextual information derived from newly
sequenced prokaryotic genomes to identify systematically the
potential functional connections of the relevant members of
the Ub-like fold and other functionally associated enzymes
such as the E1/MoeB/ThiF (E1-like) family.

Identification of novel prokaryotic ubiquitin-related
proteins

Genome Biology 2006, 7:R60

information

We investigated the origin of Ub and the Ub signaling system
as a part of a comprehensive investigation into the evolutionary history of the Ub-like (β-grasp) fold (unpublished data).
Earlier studies had shown that ThiS and MoaD are the closest
prokaryotic relatives of the eukaryotic Ub/Ubls both in structural and in functional terms [27,28]. Structural similaritybased clustering using the pair-wise structural alignment Zscores derived from the DALI program, as well morphologic
examination of the structures, showed that several additional
members of the β-grasp fold prevalent in prokaryotes are
equally closely related to the eukaryotic Ub/Ubls. The most
prominent of these was the RNA-binding TGS domain, which
was previously reported by us as being fused to several other
domains in multidomain proteins such as the threonyl tRNA
synthetase, OBG-family GTPases, and the SpoT/RelA like

interactions

Although the entire Ub system with the apparatus for conjugation and deconjugation has only been observed in the
eukaryotes, several structural and biochemical studies have
thrown light on prokaryotic antecedents of this system. Most
of these studies are related to the experimental characterization of the key sulfur incorporation steps in the biosynthetic
pathways for thiamine and molybdenum/tungsten cofactors
(MoCo/WCo). Both these pathways involve a sulfur carrier
protein, ThiS or MoaD, which is closely related to the eukaryotic URM1 and bears the sulfur in the form of a thiocarboxylate of a terminal glycine, just as the thioester linkages of Ub/
Ubls formed in the course of their conjugation [23,24]. Furthermore, both ThiS and MoaD are adenylated by the
enzymes ThiF and MoeB, respectively, prior to sulfur acceptance from the donor cysteine [25-29]. ThiF and MoeB are
closely related to the Ub-conjugating E1 enzymes, and all of
them exhibit a characteristic architecture, with an amino-terminal Rossmann-fold nucleotide-binding domain and a carboxyl-terminal β-strand-rich domain containing conserved
cysteines [25]. Interestingly, in the case of the thiamine pathway, it has been shown that ThiS also gets covalently linked to
a conserved cysteine in the ThiF enzyme, albeit via an acylpersulfide linkage, unlike the direct thioester linkage of the
E1-Ub covalent complex [26,27] (Figure 1). However, no
equivalent covalent linkage between MoaD and MoeB has
been reported [30] (Figure 1). There are other specific similarities between the eukaryotic Ub/Ubls and ThiS/MoaD,
such as the presence of a conserved carboxyl-terminal glycine
and the mode of interaction with their respective adenylating
enzymes [23,25]. These observations indicated that core components of the eukaryotic Ub-signaling system and the interactions between them were already in place in the prokaryotic
sulfur transfer systems, and implied direct evolutionary connection between them [25,31].

comment

chromatin dynamics, DNA repair, and RNA degradation.
Poly-ubiquitination via G76-K48 linkages is one of the major
types of modification that results in targeting the polypeptide
for proteasomal degradation [7]. Other polyubiquitin chains
formed by linkages to K29, K6, and K11 are relatively minor
species in model organisms and are poorly understood in
functional terms. Similarly, modification by Ubls such as
SUMO, Nedd8, URM1, Apg8/Apg12, and ISG15 have specialized regulatory roles in the context of chromatin dynamics,
RNA processing, oxidative stress response, autophagy, and
signaling [8,9]. The Ub modification is reversed by a variety
of deubiquitinating peptidases (DUBs) belonging to various
superfamilies of the papain-like fold and pepsin-like, JAB,
and Zincin-like metalloprotease superfamilies [10-16]. Of
these the most conserved are certain versions of the papainlike fold and the JAB superfamily metallo-peptidases, which
are components of the proteasomal lid and signalosome [1720]. The JAB peptidases are critical for removing the Ub
chains before the targeted proteins are degraded in the proteasome [21,22].

ppGppp phosphohydrolases [37] (also see SCOP database
[36]). The β-grasp ferredoxin, a widespread metal-chelating
domain, is also closely related, but it is distinguished by the
insertions of unique cysteine-containing flaps within the core
β-grasp fold that chelate iron atoms [38]. Other versions of
the β-grasp fold closely related to the Ub-like proteins are the
subunit B of the toluene-4-mono-oxygenase system (for
example, PDB: 1t0q) [39], which is sporadically encountered
in several proteobacteria and actinobacteria, and the YukD
protein of Bacillus subtilis and related bacteria (PDB: 2bps)
[40] Table 1.
In order to identify novel prokaryotic Ub-related members of
the β-grasp fold we initiated transitive PSI-BLAST searches,
run to convergence, using multiple representatives from each
of the above mentioned structurally characterized versions.
Searches with the TGS domains and ThiS or MoaD proteins
were considerably effective in recovering diverse homologs
with significant expect (e) values (e ≤ 0.01). Searches from
these starting points were reasonably symmetric; thus,
searches initiated with various ThiS or MoaD proteins
detected eukaryotic URM1, representatives of the TGS
domain, as well as the β-grasp ferredoxins. Likewise, searches
initiated with different representatives of the TGS domains
also recovered ThiS, MoaD, and representatives of the βgrasp ferredoxins. These searches also recovered several previously uncharacterized prokaryotic proteins in addition to
the above-stated previously known representatives of the Ublike fold. These included several divergent small proteins
equally related to both ThiS and MoaD, the amino-terminal
regions of a group of ThiF/MoeB-related (E1-like) proteins
from various bacteria, the amino-terminal regions of a family
of bacterial RNAses with the Mut7-C domain, the amino-terminal region of the family of tail assembly protein I of the
lambdoid and T1-like bacteriophages, and the RnfH family,
which is highly conserved in numerous bacteria.
For example, searches initiated with the Thermus thermophilus MoaD homolog (gi: 46200137) recovered the tail
protein I of the diverse caudate bacteriophages belonging to
the lambda and T1 groups (for example, lambda tail protein I,
e = 10-3, iteration 2). A search using the Desulfovibrio desulfuricans MoaD homolog (gi: 78219906) recovered the aminoterminal domains of an Azotobacter Mut7-C RNase (e = 10-8,
iteration 2; gi: 67154055), the TGS domain of Chlamydophila
threonyl tRNA synthetase (iteration 3, e = 10-3; gi: 15618715),
RnfH from Azoarcus (iteration 3, e = 10-3; gi: 56312934), and
a E1-like protein from Campylobacter jejuni (e = 0.01, iteration 11; gi: 57166736). Searches with the YuKD protein from
low GC Gram-positive bacteria consistently recovered a
homologous domain in large actinobacterial membrane proteins (e = 10-3-10-4 in iteration 4).
We prepared individual multiple alignments of all of the
novel families of proteins containing regions of similarity to
the Ub-like β-grasp domains and predicted their secondary

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/7/R60

structures using the JPRED method, which combines information from Hidden Markov models (HMMs), PSI-BLAST
profiles, and amino acid frequency distributions derived from
the alignments. In each case the predicted secondary structure of the region detected in the searches exhibited a characteristic pattern with two amino-terminal strands, followed by
a helical segment and another series of around three consecutive strands. This pattern is congruent with that observed in
the Ub-like β-grasp proteins (see SCOP database [36]) and
was used as a guide, along with the overall sequence conservation, to prepare a comprehensive multiple alignment that
included all of the major prokaryotic representatives of the
Ub-like β-grasp domains (Figure 2). Examination of the
sequence across the different families revealed a similar pattern of hydrophobic residues that are likely to form the core
of the β-grasp domain, as suggested by the structures of ThiS,
MoaD and URM1, and a highly conserved alcohol group containing residue (serine or threonine) before helix-1. A similar
secondary structure and conservation pattern was also found
in two additional Ub-related protein families that we recovered using contextual information from analysis of gene
neighborhoods and domain fusions (Figure 2; see the following two sections for details). Taken together, these observations strongly support the presence of an Ub-related β-grasp
fold in all of the above-detected groups of proteins.
Like the ThiS, MoaD, and URM1 proteins, the phage tail
assembly protein I (TAPI) and one of the other newly detected
Ub-related families also exhibited a highly conserved glycine
at the carboxyl-terminus of the β-grasp domain, suggesting
that they might participate in similar functional interactions
with other proteins or undergo thiolation (Figure 2). The
remaining newly detected members, while exhibiting similar
overall conservation to that of the above families, do not contain the glycine or any other highly conserved residue at the
carboxyl-terminus of the domain. Individual families also
possess their own exclusive set of highly conserved residues,
suggesting that each might participate in their own specific
conserved interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids.

Identification of contextual associations of prokaryotic
ubiquitin-related proteins and their functional partners
Detection of architectures and conserved gene neighborhoods
Different types of contextual information can be obtained by
means of prokaryotic comparative genomics and used to elucidate functionally uncharacterized proteins. First, fusions of
uncharacterized domains or genes to functionally characterized domains or genes suggest participation of the former in
processes similar to those of the latter. Second, clustering of
genes in operons usually implies coordinated gene expression, and conserved prokaryotic gene neighborhoods are a
strong indication of functional interaction, especially through
physical interactions of the encoded protein products. The
power of contextual inference, especially for the less prevalent protein families, has been considerably boosted due to
the enormous increase in data from the various microbial

several cases the ThiS and MoaD are fused to ThiG and MoaE
(Figure 3), which respectively are their functional partners in
the transfer of sulfur to the substrates (Figure 1). We also
noted that a distinct version of ThiS is fused to the carboxylterminus of the sulfite reductase in certain actinobacteria (for
example, Nocardiodes and Acidothermus cellulolyticus),
whereas MoaD might be fused to aldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductase (Azoarcus; Figure 3). Another newly characterized family of Ub-domains typified by the protein mlr6139
from Mesorhizobium loti (gi: 14025878) is characterized by
three tandem repeats of the Ub-like domain (Figure 3; see
below for details).

Common architectural themes in prokaryotic ubiquitin-like proteins

deposited research

Accordingly, we set up a protocol to identify comprehensively
the network of contextual connections centered on the
prokaryotic Ub-related proteins detected in the above
searches, and used it to infer the functional pathways in
which they participate. We first determined the complete
domain architectures of all the Ub-like proteins using a combination of case-by-case PSI-BLAST searches and searches
against libraries of position specific score matrices (PSSMs)
or HMMs of previously characterized protein domains. We
then established the gene neighborhoods (see Materials and
methods, below) for these Ub-like proteins and found a
number of conserved neighborhoods containing genes for
specific protein families often co-occurring with the Ub-like
proteins. Each of the families belonging to the conserved
neighborhoods were used as starting points for further PSIBLAST searches to identify homologous proteins in prokaryotic genomes. These homologs were then used as foci to identify any conserved gene neighborhoods occurring with them.
This way we built up a comprehensive set of conserved gene
neighborhoods for the Ub-like proteins as well as their putative functional partners and their homologs, which were
identified via contextual analysis. As a result we identified
several persistent architectural and gene neighborhood

Although the individual genes occurring in this conserved

Conserved gene neighborhoods related to the thiamine biosynthesis
pathway

The ThiS protein is highly conserved in all of the major bacterial and archaeal lineages, suggesting that it may be traced
back to the last universal common ancestor (LUCA). In most
bacterial lineages ThiS is encoded within a large operon
including several other genes for thiamine biosynthesis.
These include genes encoding proteins for both the major
branches of the thiamine biosynthetic pathway (for instance,
the aminoimidazole ribotide utilizing branch with ThiC and
ThiD, and the sulfur transfer and hydroxyl-ethyl-thiazole
forming branch with ThiS, ThiG, ThiO, ThiH) and the stem
combining the products of branches to form thiamine phosphate (ThiE; Figure 4) [50].

In the proteins typified by the Thermotoga maritima
TM_0779, the amino-terminal Ub-like domain is linked to a
carboxyl-terminal Mut7-C RNAse domain and a zinc ribbon
domain (Figure 3) [47]. Iterative sequence profile searches
with the Mut7-C domain as a query recovered the previously
characterized PIN (PilT-N) RNAse domains with significant e
values (e < 10-3). The two domains share an identical pattern
of conserved catalytic residues, suggesting a similar enzymatic mechanism [48]. In the actinobacteria, the YukD-like
β-grasp domain is fused to an integral membrane domain
with 12 transmembrane helices (Figure 3). The TGS domain,
as previously reported, was almost always found in various
RNA-binding multidomain proteins; hence it is not discussed
here in detail [37]. Likewise, the architectures of β-grasp
ferredoxins, which are typically found as a part of multidomain oxido-reductases, have previously been considered in

adenylating enzyme ThiF (approximately 20%). This is not
surprising, given that ThiF and ThiG compete for ThiS to catalyze two successive steps in the sulfur incorporation process
[25,51]. Very rarely, ThiS may also be coupled with ThiC (for
example, Cytophaga hutchinsonii). The genes for the group
of ThiF proteins containing a fused Ub-like domain at their
amino-termini (see above) typically co-occur in predicted
operons with standalone ThiS genes (Figure 4). This suggests
that their fused Ub-like domain plays a role different from the
standalone ThiS protein. However, in a single case (Pelobacter propionicus), the Ub-like domain-ThiF fusion proteins do not occur in an operon with other thiamine
biosynthesis genes, instead co-occurring with O-acetylhomoserine sulfhydrylase and cysteine synthase (Figure 4). Similar

operonic association of ThiS alone, or ThiS and ThiG with
genes for cysteine biosynthesis such as cysteine synthase, and
sulfite transporter genes are also seen in Pelodictyon and
Chlorobium (Figure 4 and Additional data file 1). These represent multiple independent associations of thiamine biosynthetic genes with sulfur assimilation and cysteine
biosynthesis genes, which is consistent with the fact that
cysteine is the sulfur donor for the ThiS thiocarboxylate.
The genes of the archaeal ThiS orthologs are not found in any
conserved gene neighborhoods, and this is consistent with the
previously noted absence of ThiF and ThiG orthologs in the
archaea, and the presence of an alternative branch for
hydroxyl-ethyl-thiazole biosynthesis [50]. This observation

This implies that both ThiS and MoaD had probably diverged

of ThiS for a sulfur transfer system in thiamine biosynthesis
emerged early in the bacterial lineage, only after it had split
from the archaeal lineage. In contrast, the deployment of
MoaD in Mo/W cofactor biosynthesis appears to have happened in the LUCA itself. The Mo/W cofactor biosynthesis

including those involved in using the GTP precursor (MoaA
and MoaC); the MoeB, MoaD and MoaE products, which are
downstream of the former and involved in molybdopterin
biosynthesis; and MoeE, MogA, MobD, and the MOSC
domain proteins, which are involved in formation of MoCo/
WCo and its terminal derivatives (Figure 4, Table 1 and
Additional data file 1) [52-54]. Although the predicted operons exhibit variability across prokaryotes in terms of the different genes included in them, the core conserved gene
neighborhood in bacteria contains the genes for MoaD and
MoaE, which together constitute the molybdopterin (MPT)
synthase, which transfers the sulfur from the MoaD thiocarboxylate to the precursor Z (cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate) to form MPT [52,55] (Figures 1 and 4). In a few cases
MoaD may be adjacent to the gene for MoeA, which acts on
the product downstream of the reaction catalyzed by the MPT
synthase. MoaD, unlike ThiS, is rarely found immediately
adjacent to the gene for its adenylating enzyme, MoeB (Figure
4). This distinction may be related to experimental results,
which indicate that MoaD and MoeB do not form a covalently
linked persulfide or thioester complex, unlike ThiS and ThiF
or the Ub/Ubl and the E1s (Figure 1) [30].
A distinct set of MoaD genes are found strictly adjacent to
genes encoding an aldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductase
(AOR) in a sporadic group of phylogenetically distant archaea
and bacteria (Table 1), suggesting that they might constitute a
mobile gene cluster. Additionally, these gene neighborhoods
often include MoeB and occasionally other cofactor biosynthesis genes such as MoaA and MoaE, and a pyridine disulfide
oxidoreductase in close vicinity to MoaD and the AOR genes
(Figure 4). In some organisms this MoaD containing gene
cluster is distinct from the MoCo biosynthesis operon found
elsewhere in the genome of the same organism. Experimentally characterized versions of these AORs have been shown
to utilize a tungsten-containing variant of the cofactor [56].
Taken together, these observations suggest that these AOR
linked MoaD genes might specifically participate in the synthesis of molybdopterin for WCo generation for the AORs.

Other potential novel pathways involving ThiS/MoaD-like proteins
and E1-like enzymes
Beyond the above-stated predicted operons, with the bona
fide ThiS/MoaD and the ThiF/MoeB enzymes involved in
conventional thiamine and MoCo/WCo biosynthesis, we also
recovered several other predicted bacterial operons encoding
homologous proteins. These gene clusters typically encode a
ThiS/MoaD related protein and an E1-like enzyme related to
ThiF/MoeB with a carboxyl-terminal rhodanese domain, but
they do not contain any genes encoding other components of
the two cofactor biosynthesis pathways (Figures 3 and 4, and
Table 1). The bacteria that contain these predicted operons
also contain independent thiamine or molybdenum operons,
highlighting the functional distinctness of the pathways
encoded by these gene neighborhoods (Table 1). Interestingly, this class of predicted operons also often contains a

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/7/R60

gene encoding a standalone version of the JAB metallopeptidase, which forms a monophyletic clade within the tree of all
JAB domains (Figures 4 and 5; see Materials and methods,
below, for details). There are at least five distinct subtypes of
this class of gene neighborhoods, which exhibit a sporadic
distribution across phylogenetically diverse bacteria, suggesting possible dispersion through lateral gene transfer (Table 1
rows 4a-4e and Figure 4). One of these subtypes of gene clusters has been shown to encode components of the biosynthetic pathway for the siderophores and secreted protective
compounds PDTC (pyridine-2,6-bis[thiocarboxylic acid])
and quinolobactin in Pseudomonas stutzeri/P. putida and P.
fluorescens, respectively [57,58]. Our analysis of gene neighborhoods revealed that related conserved gene neighborhoods are also found in several distantly related
proteobacteria, such as Ralstonia solanacearum and Nitrosomonas europaea, suggesting that such compounds might
be widely produced (Table 1 row 4a and Figure 4).
There are considerable differences in the genes and corresponding biosynthetic pathways (related to amino acid biosynthetic pathways) producing the basic molecular skeleton
of each of these metabolites. For example, in the case of quinolobactin a xanthurenic acid skeleton is used, whereas in the
case of PDTC a dipicolinic acid skeleton is used (Figure 1)
[57,58]. However, all of these operons contain a conserved
core of genes whose products catalyze the critical sulfurylation step required for the production of all of these compounds [57,58]. This core group encodes a carboxylate AMP
ligase, which adenylates a carboxylate group on the precursor, and proteins for a sulfur transfer system that forms a thiocarboxylate group from the carboxy adenylate produced by
the AMP ligase (Figure 1). The proteins of the sulfur transfer
system include an E1-like protein with a carboxyl-terminal
rhodanese domain, a ThiS/MoaD-like protein, and a protein
with a JAB metallopeptidase domain (Figure 4). The first two
enzymes are likely to participate in a sulfur transfer pathway
similar to those seen in the conventional thiamine and MoCo/
WCo pathways, with the rhodanese domain probably
abstracting the sulfur from a small molecule donor such as
cysteine (as in the case of ThiI), and the E1-like protein adenylating and transferring the sulfur to the ThiS/MoaD-like
protein to form a terminal thiocarboxylate (Figure 1).
Most other predicted operon subtypes of this class appear to
exhibit different variants of the core sulfur transfer system
seen in the above-described siderophore biosynthesis gene
clusters (Table 1 and Figure 4). A simple subtype seen in a

ever, these gene neighborhoods always contain a SirA
(cysteine containing domain 1 [CCD1]) protein, which was
predicted to play a role similar to that of rhodanese [59]
(Table 1 row 4e and Figure 4). These observations suggest
that these gene clusters are principally involved in the assimilation of sulfur from sulfate/sulfite and that this sulfur might
be terminally transferred to the ThiS/MoaD-like proteins
encoded by them.

The exact function of this protein tail assembly is unclear, but
it is not incorporated into the mature tail. Analysis of the gene
neighborhoods revealed that TAPI is most often flanked by
the genes encoding the TAPK protein, with JAB and NlpC/
P60 peptidase domains, and the TAPJ protein, which is
required for host specificity (Table 1 row 5 and Figure 4). The
JAB domains found in these gene associations are also a part
of the monophyletic clade, including those from the abovedescribed class of gene neighborhoods. Variants of this
organization lacking either of the two flanking genes are seen
in a few phages/prophages, and in a small group of phages
TAPI is flanked by a version of TAPK containing only an
NlpC/P60 peptidase domain (Figure 4). It is possible that the
latter versions are actually degenerate variants of the former
versions and are typical of integrated prophages.

Predicted gene clusters coding E1-like proteins, E2 (UBC)-like
proteins, JAB peptidase, and novel Ub-like proteins
A number of sets of predicted operons, each with a distinctive
sporadic distribution across several phylogenetically distant
bacteria and encoding proteins with JAB domain and E1-like
enzymes, were recovered in our search for conserved gene
neighborhoods. E1-like enzymes in these gene neighborhoods
never contained a carboxyl-terminal rhodanese domain.
However, they were typically fused, either at the amino-terminus or the carboxyl-terminus, to the JAB domain. In the
instances in which they were not fused to the JAB domain,
there was always a JAB domain protein encoded by the
immediately adjacent gene in the predicted operon (Table 1
rows 6a-6e and Figure 4). One group of proteins, typified by
an E1-like protein fused to a JAB domain at the carboxyl-terminus, also contained an additional conserved amino-terminal domain, with a conserved histidine and cysteine (for
example, Mdeg02000735 from Microbulbifer degradans, gi:
48864353; Table 1 row 6a and Figure 3). Iterative PSI-BLAST
searches with the alignment of this domain as a seed recovered eukaryotic E2 (ubiquitin conjugating enzymes [UBC])
enzymes as hits with significant e values (e = 10-3, iteration 3).
The predicted secondary structure of these domains was congruent with that of eukaryotic E2 domains, with a four-strand
β-meander and two flanking helices on either side [61]. Furthermore, the conserved histidine and cysteine of the bacterial proteins also precisely matched the cognate active site
residues of the eukaryotic E2 enzymes, suggesting that the

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/7/R60

amino-terminal domains of the bacterial domain are
homologs of the E2 enzymes and likely to possess similar
activity (Figure 6).
In addition, each set of these predicted operons contained a
distinct group of genes that almost exclusively co-occurred
with a particular operon type. Based on the different groups
of co-occurring genes, we were able identify at least five major
operon types (Table 1 rows 6a-6e and Figure 4). These groups
of co-occurring genes encoded several conserved uncharacterized proteins, whose evolutionary relationships we systematically investigated using sequence profile searches,
secondary structure prediction, and matches to libraries of
profiles and HMMs for various previously characterized
domains.
The first of these operon types exhibited a very simple organization, usually with two genes. One of them encoded the triple module protein, with amino-terminal E2-like and E1-like
domains followed by a carboxyl-terminal JAB domain (Figure
3). The second gene in the operon encoded a specialized version of the metallo-β-lactamase domain (Table 1 row 6a and
Figure 4). Another operon group typified by a conserved gene
neighborhood from the Escherichia coli integrative and conjugative element (ICE) [62] and related mobile elements was
found to contain a nucleotidyl transferase of the polymerase
β-fold [63], in addition to the genes encoding the E1-like and
JAB domain proteins (Table 1 row 6b and Figure 4). Like the
E1-like proteins from the first group of conserved gene clusters the E1-like proteins of this group also show a fusion to an
E2-related domain with a conserved active site cysteine (Figure 6). Similarly, a conserved operon group prototyped by a
gene neighborhood from the megaplasmid NGR234 of Rhizobium sp. contains genes encoding two conserved uncharacterized proteins, one of which is predicted to contain a metalbinding domain based on the conserved pattern of two
cysteines, a histidine, and an acidic residue (Table 1 row 6c
and Figure 4). We observed that the E1-like proteins encoded
by both of these operon types contained an additional aminoterminal domain with a conserved cysteine. Sequence
searches with this amino-terminal region recovered the UBClike E2 domains from a variety of eukaryotes. The best hit to
these domains was from a profile of the E2-like proteins and
included a match to the conserved cysteine (P < 10-5 match for

this cysteine containing motif in a Gibbs sampling search,
with the MACAW program, including a wide range of known
E2 domains). Secondary structure prediction for this
conserved domain also showed complete congruence with the
known structure of the E2 fold, suggesting that these aminoterminal domains fused to the E1-like enzymes are also
homologs of the eukaryotic E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes
(Figure 6).
A fourth operon type found in several diverse bacteria (Table
1 row 6d) typically contained three additional genes in the
conserved gene neighborhood, in addition to the genes of the
JAB domain and E1-like proteins (Figure 4). Furthermore,
the JAB domain has an amino-terminal α + β domain that has
a strictly conserved arginine and tryptophan residue (JAB-N;
Figure 3). The first of these encodes a small protein with a
highly conserved glycine at the carboxyl-terminus. Secondary
structure prediction revealed that this small protein has a
progression of structural elements identical to that seen in the
β-grasp fold (Figure 2). The conservation pattern in this protein also strongly resembles that seen in the known β-grasp
domains, and sequence-structure threading using the PHYRE
program also recovered β-grasp proteins (for example, ThiS
and PDB: 1tyg) as the best hits, suggesting that these are small
standalone Ub-like proteins. The second protein encoded by
this operon type was found to encode a largely α-helical protein with absolutely conserved charged and polar residues,
suggesting that it might be an uncharacterized enzyme. The
third conserved protein from these gene neighborhoods contained a conserved cysteine and gave significant hits to the
profiles of the E2 Ub-conjugating enzymes, with the alignments spanning the conserved cysteine (Figure 6). This
relationship was also supported by their predicted secondary
structure and general conservation pattern. Although these
proteins did not have the conserved histidine at the position
often encountered in most E2 enzymes, they had an absolute
conserved histidine further downstream (Figure 6). Mapping
of the sequences of representatives of this family of proteins
on the structures of E2 enzymes showed that this downstream
histidine from the helix would be positioned very close to the
active site histidine of the classical E2 enzymes (Figure 6).
This would mean that these proteins are likely to effectively
contain an active site similar to the classical E2 enzymes.
The fifth operon type is found sporadically in most proteobacterial lineages, cyanobacteria, and certain actinobacteria
(Table 1 row 6e). Usually these gene neighborhoods contain
two or three genes in addition to the central gene for an E1like enzyme, which in most cases contains a JAB domain
fused to the amino-terminus of the E1-like module. However,
in a subset of bacteria the E1-like protein contains a fusion to
an uncharacterized amino-terminal domain in place of the
JAB domain (Figure 2). The conservation pattern of this
domain is unrelated to that of the JAB domain, but it contains
several conserved charged residues, making it tempting to
speculate that it might perform a function analogous to the

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/7/R60

JAB domains. The other gene found in all gene neighborhoods of this type encodes a protein containing one to three
repeats of an approximately 70-75 amino acid domain. The
conservation pattern is similar to that seen in Ubls, and the
predicted secondary structure of this domain exhibits a progression completely congruent to other β-grasp fold domains
(Figure 2). Consistent with this, sequence-structure threading with the PHYRE program recovered the structures of the
ThiS/MoaD proteins as the top hits (for example, PDB: 1tyg).
These observations strongly suggest that this group of proteins is comprised of one or more Ub-like domains Table 1.
Furthermore, we noted that these predicted β-grasp domain
proteins might also be fused with either of two unrelated
carboxyl-terminal domains (Table 1). The first of these
domains is a small domain of about 75 residues exhibiting a
conservation pattern and secondary structure progression
similar to the Ubls (Figure 2). These domains also recovered
ThiS/MoaD as their best hits in sequence-structure threading
with the PHYRE program, implying that it might form the
third Ub-like domain in a subset of these proteins. The second
carboxyl-terminal domain found in a mutually exclusive subset of these proteins also occasionally occurs as a standalone
protein encoded by a separate gene sandwiched between the
genes for the multi-β-grasp domain protein and the JAB + E1
domain proteins (Figure 3). Profile searches with an alignment of this domain recovered hits to the E2 enzymes and the
eukaryotic RWD domain [61,64], which contains a catalytically inactive version of the E2 fold as the best hits (e about
0.01-0.005). This relationship was also supported by the congruence of the predicted secondary structure of these
domains with that of the E2 and RWD domains [61]. Like the
eukaryotic RWD domains, these bacterial domains also
lacked the conserved cysteine residue, implying that they are
likely to be catalytically inactive representatives of the E2-like
fold (Figure 6). The above operon type was also seen to
encode another conserved protein with a C-x(3)-C-x(35-38)H-x(2)-C signature (Figure 4). The predicted secondary
structure of this potential metal-binding signature is consistent with proteins containing a Zn finger domain, perhaps of
the treble-clef fold.

The RnfH associated conserved gene neighborhoods
and other miscellaneous conserved gene
neighborhoods
The RnfH protein is highly conserved across the β/γ proteobacteria (Table 1 row 8), and in each of these instances it
occurs in a strongly conserved gene neighborhood also containing genes for a START domain protein, the transfer
mRNA (tmRNA) binding protein SmpB, and a small membrane protein of unknown function SmpA. In this gene neighborhood we observed that the predicted promoter (or
transcriptional regulatory regions) for the SmpB, the START
domain protein, and RnfH appear to be shared in a small
intergenic segment, with the former gene being transcribed in
the opposite direction to the latter two (Figure 4). This neigh-

Much of the above-described diversity of prokaryotic functional systems involving Ub-signaling related proteins
remains experimentally unexplored. However, the syntactical
features of the domain architectures and conserved gene
neighborhoods provide some hints regarding the general
functional properties of these systems (Figures 4 and 7). One
of the most striking features is the dichotomy in distribution,
operon organization, and domain architectures of the ver-

One of the most interesting features of these predicted functional systems is the presence of the JAB domain (Figure 5),
which is universally conserved in eukaryotes and is the primary deubiqutinating peptidase/isopeptidase associated
with the proteasome [21,22] (Figure 6). The association of the
JAB peptidase with just an Ub-like protein with a carboxylterminal glycine in the phage tail assembly gene clusters
strongly implies that the two domains form a functional unit
even in the prokaryotes. It is quite probable that the phage
TAPI is processed by the peptidase domains of TAPK, with
the JAB probably releasing the Ub-like domain by cleaving at
the point of the carboxyl-terminal-most glycine of the Ub
domain. A similar function may be envisaged for the JAB
domain in the organisms where ThiS or MoaD is fused to
some other proteins; it might cleave off the Ubl-like moiety
and generate a free carboxyl-terminus for sulfur transfer.
However, the strong association of the JAB with sporadically
distributed operon types related to the Pseudomonas
siderophore biosynthesis pathways is more mysterious.
Based on the complete absence of JAB proteins in the thiamine and MoCo/WCo pathways, we predict that in the pathways in which the E1-like enzyme is found in association with
the JAB domain it functions via a mechanism distinct from
that used by classical ThiF or MoeB. This mechanism is likely
to be closer to the Ub transfer reaction of bona fide eukaryotic
E1s, wherein the ThiS/MoaD or any other associated Ub-like
protein is directly linked to a cysteine in the E1-like enzyme by
a thioester linkage. In this situation, it is likely that the E1-like
enzyme also transfers the covalently linked Ub-like protein to
amino groups of lysines in particular target proteins. These
linkages (equivalent to the isopeptide linkages of eukaryotic

sions involved in thiamine and MoCo/WCo biosynthesis and
majority of other predicted operons (Table 1 and Figure 4).
The former set of operons is highly conserved and is present
across most bacterial and several archaeal lineages, which is
suggestive of a pattern of vertical inheritance from LUCA or
early in bacterial evolution. The other types of abovedescribed predicted operons are instead sporadic in their distribution and found patchily across phylogenetically unrelated bacteria (Table 1). The former types do not contain a
single instance of a gene encoding a JAB domain protein or a
fusion to a JAB domain. In contrast to the thiamine and
MoCo/Wco operons, the majority of other gene neighborhoods code a JAB domain protein along with an E1-like
enzyme and/or Ub-like protein (Figure 4 and Table 1). A
subset of these, namely those involved in the biosynthesis of
siderophore-like compounds and those associated with sulfur
assimilation and cysteine synthase, are linked with genes
encoding metabolic enzymes. This suggests a role for them in
the biochemistry of sulfur transfer, albeit in pathways that are
likely to be distinct from the thiamine and MoCo/WCo (Figure 1). The other gene neighborhoods exhibit no major links
to metabolic enzymes, suggesting that they might specify
standalone regulatory pathways.

reviews

In addition to this, there other gene clusters encoding Ubrelated β-grasp domain proteins, such as the Tmo and YukD
associated conserved gene neighborhoods. The Tmo operon
encodes the toluene monooxygenase complex in several bacteria (Figure 4, Table 1 row 10). TmoB, the Ub-related protein
of this complex, has been shown to be a subunit of the toluene/o-xylene mono-oxygenase hydroxylase, which binds a
distinct conserved exposed ridge on the catalytic subunit
[39]. However, it does not affect the activity of the enzyme in
vitro and its exact role in the complex remains unknown. The
predicted operons coding the Ub-like YukD proteins are
found in several low GC Gram-positive bacteria, and we discovered additional homologs of them in actinobacteria (Figure 4, Table 1 row 11). In both of these bacterial taxa, the YukD
protein is found in the neighborhood of the ESAT-6 export
system (which at its core consists of a α-helical polypeptide),
the virulence protein ESAT-6, and an FtsK-like ATPase that
pumps these polypeptides outside the cell [67-69]. The actinobacterial YukD is always fused to a transmembrane domain
consisting of 12 transmembrane helices. Additionally, the
actinobacterial gene clusters contain a subtilisin-like protease
(mycosin), members of the α-helical PE family, and the membrane-associated PPE family of proteins. The predicted operons of the low GC Gram-positive bacteria instead contain an
S/T kinase and a membrane protein prototyped by the bacillus YueB protein (Figure 4). Experimental investigations
showed that the YukD protein is not covalently conjugated
with other proteins [40]. Our analysis of the gene neighborhood suggests that they may be involved as an assembly factor
or structural component of the ESAT-6 polypeptide export
system that might export a range of virulence factors in mycobacteria and potential signaling molecules in low GC Grampositive bacteria.

The potential regulatory pathways defined by conserved gene
neighborhoods that combine JAB and E1-like domain proteins often encode their own Ub domain proteins and
homologs of the eukaryotic Ub conjugating E2 enzymes.
Given the presence of E2 homologs, it is quite likely that these
are indeed dedicated protein-modifying systems that add the
associated Ub-like proteins or the available ThiS/MoaD to
target proteins. In these cases we predict that the JAB domain
is likely to be important for both processing the Ub-like proteins and removing them from the target proteins, thus con-

stituting a genuine bacterial version of the eukaryotic Ubsignaling system. The operon type prototyped by the E. coli
ICE element also encodes a nucleotidyl transferase (Figure 4
and Table 1 row 6b), which might provide an additional protein modification like its homolog the uridylyl transferase,
which modifies glutamine synthase [63,70]. It is particularly
interesting to note that some of these systems contain proteins with two to three tandem repeats of the Ub-like domain
(reminiscent of the eukaryotic poly-ubiquitin) or RWD
domain-like inactive versions of the E2-like fold, which probably bind the Ub moieties (Figures 1 and 6, and Table 1 row

The identification of numerous prokaryotic systems containing proteins related to ubiquitin, E1, E2, and the JAB domain,
beyond the previously known versions found in the thiamine
and MoCo/WCo biosynthesis operons, throw considerable
light on the emergence of the eukaryotic Ub-signaling system
(Figure 7). Among the oldest versions of the Ub-fold are the
TGS domains that are traced back to LUCA and bind RNA
[37,77]. This suggests that the Ub-like versions of the β-grasp

Evolutionary implications of prokaryotic cognates of
the ubiquitin-signaling system

The operon and domain architecture evidence suggests that
reaction mechanisms similar to the eukaryotic E1 enzymes
emerged next in specialized versions of the E1-like/Ub-like
protein pairs found in the prokaryotes. These systems also
added a JAB domain protein, probably in a role similar to that
of their eukaryotic counterparts. The sequence and organizational diversity of the E1-like, E2-like, and Ub-like proteins
from these remarkable bacterial systems is much higher than
that seen in their eukaryotic cognates. This suggests that
these systems probably first diversified in bacteria, and were
acquired by the eukaryotes during their emergence via the
symbiotic process involving the α-proteobacterial precursor
of the mitochondrion. This is consistent with the frequent
presence of the more complex Ub-signaling related systems
in α-proteobacteria (Table 1). On the face of it, the E3
enzymes such as the RING domain and the HECT domain
appear to be eukaryotic innovations. However, it cannot be
ruled out that the additional uncharacterized proteins, such
as the above-described Zn finger protein encoded in the bacterial gene neighborhoods (Figure 4 and Table 1), act as E3like adaptors. However, it is clear that the core of the Ub
transfer system, as well as the main peptidase required for its
removal, namely the JAB domain, were already linked as a
functional complex in the bacteria, before the emergence of
the eukaryotes. The bacteriophage tail assembly system contains an NlpC/P60 peptidase, typically fused to the JAB
domain (Figure 3), which might also be involved in processing the Ub-related protein. Given that the NlpC/P60 peptidase contains a papain-like fold also found in most of the
eukaryotic DUBs, it is possible that the functional association
between Ub-like domains and the papain-like peptidase

reports

Other tantalizing, but uncertain, links between components
of the bacterial Ub-like systems and protein stability are suggested by some of the conserved gene neighborhoods. The
operon that encodes a JAB domain protein, an Ub-like
protein related to ThiS/MoaD and ClpS, is one such (Figure 4
and Table 1 row 4d). The ClpS domain recognizes the aminoterminal domain of proteins targeted for destruction and
links them to the protein-degrading ClpAP machine in bacteria and the RING finger E3 ligase of the eukaryotic N-recognins [75,76]. It is possible that this system may be involved
in modification of proteins by an Ub-like modification before
linkage by ClpS for degradation. A more enigmatic case is
offered by the linkage between RnfH and SmpB; here apparently no Ub-like transfer system is involved. However, the
tight neighborhood association with SmpB suggests that
RnfH could in principle, under as yet unstudied conditions,
interact with the tmRNA and influence protein stability.

domain. This is also supported by the observation that versions related to ThiS/MoaD, like the one fused to the Mut7-C
RNAse domain (Figure 3), are also likely to participate in a
RNA-binding function (Figure 7). Such a function might also
hold for the RnfH protein, which is most closely related to the
TGS domains (Figure 2). However, it is also clear that the
MoaD and ThiS versions were also present in LUCA, implying
that the divergence between sulfur carrier and RNA-binding
versions occurred before the LUCA. The analysis of the
phyletic patterns of the predicted operons suggests that the
sulfur carrier version was a part of molybdenum metabolism
in LUCA itself, whereas its recruitment for thiamine biosynthesis happened at the base of the bacterial tree. Likewise, at
least a single representative of the E1-like enzymes had differentiated from the remaining Rossmann-type folds, through
the acquisition of a distinct carboxyl-terminal module, by the
time of the LUCA. Even in these two ancient pathways there
appears to have been a progressive increase in the complexity
of the reaction catalyzed by the E1-like enzyme on the Ub-like
protein. Originally, it appears to have been merely an adenylation reaction, as has been suggested for the MoeB-MoaD
pair [30]. However, the ThiS-ThiF pair involved an additional
formation of a covalent persulfide linkage between the E1-like
enzyme and the Ub-like protein (Figure 1).

reviews

The predicted biochemical functions of these systems and the
mobile gene clusters encoding β-grasp or JAB domain proteins are entirely unrelated. However, it is quite possible that
in a general sense, like the two former systems, these gene
clusters also maintain themselves by providing the cell with
oppositely directed activities. Accordingly, we speculate that
the JAB domain and the E1 + E2 complex provides a system
that uses an endogenous ThiS/MoaD protein or the distinct
Ub-like protein encoded by the mobile operon to alternately
modify or de-modify cellular target proteins. This system
might provide a means of regulating target protein stability
and maintains itself by either acting as an addiction system
like the toxin-antitoxin systems or as a means of protection
against invasive replicons as the restriction-modification
systems.

or absence even within closely related strains of same organism, and indeed some of them are borne by conjugative
mobile elements (Table 1). This pattern of mobility is reminiscent of some other conserved operon systems such as the

prokaryotic systems and protein degradation via ATPdependent proteolytic machines are less clear, although there
are some hints that the prokaryotic Ub-like domains might
even play a role in such a process.

Conclusion

By performing a systematic search for Ub-like domains in
bacteria we identified several novel domains with diverse
domain architectures. We present evidence that there are several predicted bacterial operons, beyond those specifying the
previously well characterized thiamine and MoCo/WCo biosynthesis systems that encode Ub-related, JAB domain, and
E1-like and E2-like proteins. These gene neighborhoods
exhibit several distinct organizational themes, each of which
is likely to specify a distinct functional system. Some of these
systems are likely to possess the capacity to transfer Ub-like
protein moieities onto target proteins via a relay of E1-like
and E2-like proteins. This is the first report of a genuine
prokaryotic ubiquitin-like signaling system, and we suggest
that these systems were the precursors to the eukaryotic Ubsignaling system. We hope this report may stimulate experimental analysis of these bacterial systems and thereby throw
light on the emergence of a signaling system that was hitherto
considered the unique property of the eukaryotes.

Materials and methods

The nonredundant (NR) database of protein sequences
(National Center for Biotechnology Information [NCBI],
NIH, Bethesda, MA, USA) was searched using the BLASTP
program [78]. A complete list of these genomes and the predicted proteomes of prokaryotes used in this analysis in fasta
format can be downloaded from the Complete Microbial
Genomes database at the NCBI [79]. Additional sequences,
from microbial genomes that have been sequenced but not
completely assembled and submitted to the GenBank database, were also used in this analysis. A list of these
prokaryotic genomes, from which sequences have been
deposited in GenBank, can be accessed from the Draft Assembly Sequences database at the NCBI website [80]. Gene
neighborhoods were determined using a custom script that
uses completely sequenced genomes or whole genome shot
gun sequences to derive a table of gene neighbors centered on
a query gene. Then the BLASTCLUST program was used to
cluster the products in the neighborhood and establish conserved co-occurring genes. These conserved gene neighborhood are then sorted as per a ranking scheme based on
occurrence in at least one other phylogenetically distinct lineage ('phylum' in the NCBI Taxonomy database), complete
conservation in a particular lineage ('phylum'), and physical
closeness (<70 nucleotides) on the chromosome indicating
sharing of regulatory -10 and -35 elements. Putative promoter
regions were predicted if required by scanning for the consen-

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/7/R60

sus of the -10 and -35 elements in the predicted upstream
regions.
Profile searches were conducted using the PSI-BLAST program with either a single sequence or an alignment used as
the query, with a default profile inclusion expectation (e)
value threshold of 0.01 (unless specified otherwise), and was
iterated until convergence. For all searches involving membrane-spanning domains we used a statistical correction for
compositional bias to reduce false positives due to the general
hydrophobicity of these proteins [81]. The library of profiles
for various signaling domains was prepared by extracting all
alignments from the PFAM database [82] and updating them
by adding new members from the NR database. These
updated alignments were then used to make HMMs with the
HMMER package [83] or PSSMs with PSI-BLAST.
Multiple alignments were constructed using the T_Coffee,
MUSCLE, and PCMA programs followed by manual adjustments based on PSI-BLAST results [84-86]. The GIBSS sampling method, as implemented in the MACAW program, was
used for the identification and statistical evaluation of conserved motifs in multiple protein sequences [87,88]. All
large-scale sequence analysis procedures were carried out
using the TASS package (Anantharaman V, Balaji S, Aravind
L; unpublished data). Structural manipulations were carried
out using the Swiss-PDB viewer program [89]. Searches of
the PDB database with query structures were conducted
using the DALI program [90,91]. Protein secondary structure
was predicted using a multiple alignment as the input for the
JPRED program, with information extracted from a PSSM,
HMM, and the seed alignment itself [92]. Similarity-based
clustering of proteins was carried out using the BLASTCLUST
program [93]. Sequence-structure threading was carried out
using the PHYRE and 3DPSSM programs [94]. Phylogenetic
analysis was carried out using the maximum-likelihood,
neighbor-joining, and least squares methods [95-97]. Briefly,
this process involved the construction of a least squares tree
using the FITCH program or a neighbor joining tree using the
NEIGHBOR program (both from the Phylip package) [95],
followed by local rearrangement using the Protml program of
the Molphy package [96] to arrive at the maximum likelihood
tree. The statistical significance of various nodes of this maximum likelihood tree was assessed using the relative estimate
of logarithmic likelihood bootstrap (Protml RELL-BP), with
10,000 replicates. Text versions of all alignments reported in
this study can be obtained in the Additional data file 1.
