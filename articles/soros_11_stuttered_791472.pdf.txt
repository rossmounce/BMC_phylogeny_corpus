Abstract
Background: Various functional resonance imaging, magnetoencephalographic and lesion studies suggest the
involvement of the insular cortex in the control of swallowing. However, the exact location of insular activation
during swallowing and its functional significance remain unclear.
Case presentation: Invasive electroencephalographic monitoring was performed in a 24-year-old man with
medically intractable stereotyped nocturnal hypermotor seizures due to a ganglioglioma. During stimulation of the
right inferior posterior insular cortex with depth electrodes the patient spontaneously reported a perception of a
“stutter in swallowing”. Stimulation of the inferior posterior insular cortex at highest intensity (4 mA) was also
associated with irregular and delayed swallows. Swallowing was not impaired during stimulation of the superior
posterior insular cortex, regardless of stimulation intensity.
Conclusions: These results indicate that the right inferior posterior insular cortex is involved in the neural circuitry
underlying the control of swallowing.

Background
Swallowing is a complex sensorimotor function involving the coordinated activation of orofacial, pharyngeal,
laryngeal, respiratory, and esophageal muscles. Although
once attributed to brainstem circuits, electrophysiologic
studies in animals [1], and functional brain-mapping in
humans [2-4] have also implicated a distributed corticalsubcortical network in swallowing neural control involving the bilateral primary sensorimotor cortex, premotor
and cingulate motor areas, frontoparietal operculum,
and the insula (for review, see [5-7]). The notion of a
cortical-subcortical network controlling swallowing is
further supported by lesion studies in humans [8-11].
Although various lines of evidence, supported by
functional resonance imaging [3,12], magnetoencephalography [13] and lesion data [8], point at the involvement of the insular cortex in the control of swallowing,
the exact involvement of the insula and its functional

significance remain unclear. While the right anterior
insula has been particularly implicated in swallowing
impairment [11,14], brain-imaging studies of swallowing
have reported both anterior and posterior insular activation. A recent quantitative meta-analysis of swallowrelated brain activity reported high activation likelihood
in the right anterior insular cortex for water swallowing,
and in the right posterior insula for voluntary saliva
swallowing [15].
Studying swallowing neural control is not only
important for basic neurophysiological research but
also from a clinical perspective because injury to the
central nervous system such as stroke frequently
results in significant swallowing impairment [16].
Indeed, brain injury can give rise to severe and protracted swallowing impairment, which necessitates tube
feeding. Current understanding of the neuropathophysiology of swallowing impairment, the neuroplastic
mechanisms underlying swallowing recovery, as well as
the principles of swallowing rehabilitation is limited
(for review, see [17]).

potential impact of surgery on swallowing, the patient
swallowed a continuous water infusion (1 ml/s) delivered
manually to the mouth via a catheter-tipped syringe.
During water swallowing, electrodes S-pIC (superior posterior insular cortex) and I-pIC (inferior posterior insular
cortex) were stimulated individually with increasing stimulation intensities. Swallowing was recorded from the
output of a laryngeal movement sensor.
Stimulation with electrode I-pIC at 4 mA was associated
with a dysrhythmic pattern of swallowing as indicated by
irregular and delayed swallows (Figure 2A). Moreover, at
all intensity levels of stimulation with electrode I-pIC, the
patient spontaneously reported a perception of a “stutter
in swallowing”. In contrast, swallowing was not impaired
during stimulation with S-pIC, regardless of stimulation
intensity (Figure 2B). EEG recordings revealed that all epileptic spikes and seizures originated from the right inferior
posterior insular cortex.
The tumor was surgically removed after invasive electroencephalographic monitoring and diagnosed as a
ganglioglioma, a mostly benign neoplasm arising from
ganglion cells. Gangliogliomas are often located in the
medial and lateral temporal lobes, superior and middle
temporal gyri, parahippocampal gyrus and amygdala
[19], but can be found anywhere in the brain. Gangliogliomas are a frequent cause of intractable epilepsy [20].
The patient has been seizure free after removal of the
ganglioglioma.

Case presentation
Electrical stimulation of the right posterior insular
cortex was performed in a 24-year-old right-handed
man who developed medically intractable epilepsy at the
age of 17 years and who was referred for invasive electroencephalographic monitoring and pre-surgical mapping. He was suffering from stereotyped nocturnal
hypermotor seizures nearly every night. His neurological
examination was normal. MRI of the brain showed a
well-circumscribed tumor (18 × 12 × 11 mm) in the
right posterior insular cortex (Figure 1A).
Pre-surgical electric stimulation was performed using
depth electrodes that were implanted in the right posterior insular cortex, above and below the tumor (1 mm
diameter size; Ad Tec Medical Instrument Corp.,
Racine, WI, USA) [18]. The depth electrodes were
inserted stereotactically using a Leksell stereotactic
frame and a Stealth station planning system (MedtronicSofamor Danek, Minneapolis, MN, USA). The depth
electrode lines had 8 contacts (each 2 mm long) separated by 2 mm. A transopercular approach was used to
implant the depth electrodes in the right insular cortex
above and below the lesion. The distal electrode contacts of each depth line were located within the right
posterior insular cortex. Location of the electrode contacts was confirmed by fusing a pre-implantation MRI
to a post-implantation CT scan with the aid of a volumetric mutual information algorithm using the Atamai
software (Atamai, Inc., London, ON, Canada; Figure 1B).
High frequency (50 Hz) bipolar electric impulses were
applied at four different intensity levels (1, 2, 3 and 4
mA) with a pulse duration of 0.3 ms over 2 s (Grass
Technologies, West Warwick, RI, USA). To assess the

The insula is a phylogenetically old, as well as cytoarchitectonically and functionally diverse area, integrating

brain. Lesion studies [11,14] and functional brain imaging
[12] have suggested that the anterior insular cortex is
involved in the control of swallowing. The anterior insula
has been implicated in the processing of visceral sensation from the pharynx [21], esophagus and gastrointestinal tract [22], vibrotactile stimulation [23], gustation
[24], olfaction [25], and emotions such as disgust [26].
Other fMRI studies, however, reported swallow-related
activation of the posterior insula [3], which is involved in
autonomic regulation [18,27], including heart rate and
respiration. Consistent with this, a meta-analysis of swallow-related brain imaging implicated both the anterior
and posterior insula in swallowing [15].
Notwithstanding the possibility that slow tumor
growth may have engaged compensatory swallowing
mechanisms [28], the present finding that electrical stimulation of the right inferior posterior insula disrupts
rhythmic water swallowing provides further evidence
that the posterior insular cortex is involved in the neural
circuitry underlying the control of swallowing.
Our results are consistent with previous cortical stimulation studies of the posterior insular cortex which
resulted in visceral sensations and interference with
swallowing [29]. Recently, detailed mapping of the insular cortex in epilepsy patients has been performed using
electrical stimulation [30,31]. In 50 patients, electrical
stimulation of the anterior and posterior insular cortex

elicited 125 clinical responses, 22% of which involved a
viscerosensory effect. Half of these viscerosensory
responses consisted of sensations of unpleasant laryngopharyngeal constriction [30]. In one patient, spontaneous seizures originated from the right anterior insular
cortex and quickly propagated to the right posterior
insular cortex [30]; these seizures began with strong laryngeal discomfort and an unpleasant sensation of constriction, similar to the viscerosensory sensations elicited
by electrical stimulation [30]. Another insular mapping
study, again using electrical stimulation in epilepsy
patients, reported that insular stimulation evoked sensations of a pharyngeal constriction and a sensation of
swallowing associated with mastication [31].
The strong representation of viscerosensory afferents
in the insular cortex, as indicated by electrophysiological
recordings [30] and functional neuroimaging data [21],
as well as the importance of upper airway sensory input
for the control of swallowing [32], raises the possibility
that the disruption of water swallowing observed in our
patient may have been related to oropharyngeallaryngeal sensory alterations, such as discomfort or constriction, elicited by the electrical stimulation. Although
our patient did not report isolated upper airway sensations
during the stimulation protocol, it is conceivable that disruption of oropharyngeal-laryngeal sensory processing
may have interfered with normal water swallowing and

created the impression of “stuttered swallowing”. Alternatively, disruption of water swallowing in the present case
may have occurred due to an effect of insular stimulation
on swallowing motor execution. Further studies are
required to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the swallowing phenomena documented in this clinical case.
