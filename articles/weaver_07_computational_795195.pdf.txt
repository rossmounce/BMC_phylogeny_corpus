Conclusion: Computational approaches successfully identified miRNAs in the honey bee and
indicated previously unrecognized miRNAs in the well-studied Drosophila melanogaster genome
despite the 280 million year distance between these insects. Differentially transcribed miRNAs are
likely to be involved in regulating honey bee development, and arguably in the extreme
developmental switch between sterile worker bees and highly fertile queens.

interactions

Results: Three independent computational surveys of the assembled honey bee genome identified
a total of 65 non-redundant candidate miRNAs, several of which appear to have previously
unrecognized orthologs in the Drosophila genome. A subset of these candidate miRNAs were
screened for expression by quantitative RT-PCR and/or genome tiling arrays and most predicted
miRNAs were confirmed as being expressed in at least one honey bee tissue. Interestingly, the
transcript abundance for several known and novel miRNAs displayed caste or age-related
differences in honey bees. Genes in proximity to miRNAs in the bee genome are
disproportionately associated with the Gene Ontology terms 'physiological process', 'nucleus' and
'response to stress'.

refereed research

Background: Non-coding microRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators of gene expression in
eukaryotes. Insect miRNAs help regulate the levels of proteins involved with development,
metabolism, and other life history traits. The recently sequenced honey bee genome provides an
opportunity to detect novel miRNAs in both this species and others, and to begin to infer the roles
of miRNAs in honey bee development.

Background

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play pivotal roles in diverse biological
processes through post-transcriptional regulation of gene
expression. These short (approximately 22 nucleotide (nt))
non-coding RNAs repress protein synthesis by binding to
partially complementary sites in the 3' untranslated regions
(UTRs) of target genes [1-3]. MiRNAs affect biological phenomena such as cell proliferation, embryo and tissue differentiation [4], morphological change [5], and apoptosis, aging
and life span [6]. Overall, miRNAs appear to regulate much of
the coding transcriptome, influencing the spatial and temporal expression patterns of thousands of genes in plants, nematodes, insects, and vertebrates [7,8]. The pervasive influence
of miRNAs exerts strong selective pressures on nucleotide
sequences. Either positive selection for, or negative selection
against, miRNA target sites can be detected in the 3' UTRs of
most genes [9,10].
MiRNA sequences are often, but not invariably, highly conserved across great evolutionary distances, allowing identification of nearly identical short oligonucleotides that affect
gene expression in species as divergent as worms and man
[11]. This extraordinary sequence conservation may be indicative of extraordinary functional conservation, or some other
exceptional evolutionary constraint. For instance, because a
single miRNA may regulate hundreds of genes, mutation of a
mature miRNA sequence could pleiotropically affect the
expression breadth and specificity of many gene targets [12].
Thus, preservation of miRNA function in the wake of miRNA
mutation would require coordinated compensatory mutation
of each of its target's 3' UTRs - predicted to be an exceedingly
rare confluence of events. Consequently, the sequence, structure and some functions of miRNAs may be conserved [13],
while the specific gene targets and regulatory networks of
particular miRNAs may exhibit significant interspecies variation [14].
The recently sequenced honey bee genome [15] provides an
opportunity to detect novel miRNAs in this species and others, and to begin to infer the roles of miRNAs in key life history traits of honey bees, such as the development of fertile as
well as sterile ('worker') individuals. Here we present the
results of three independent computational surveys and transcriptional evidence for known and novel miRNAs. We suggest several novel miRNA candidates in honey bees. Some of
these novel miRNAs appear to have been overlooked in analyses of the well-studied insect Drosophila melanogaster and
other genomes.

Results
Computational identification of putative miRNAs
We exploited the whole genome assembly of the honey bee to
predict candidate miRNAs. Three non-exclusive sets of
miRNA candidates were compiled. First, honey bee
sequences homologous to miRNAs listed in miRBase [16]

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/6/R97

were identified (HOM). Second, microconserved-sequence
elements (MCEs), continuous sequences of lengths 22
through 29 nt that are common to and precisely conserved in
all three of the Apis mellifera, D. melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae genomes, were catalogued [17].
Finally, slightly longer bee sequences (75-90 nt) sharing
structural features characteristic of miRNAs and aligning well
with similar sequences in Drosophila - an approach we call
stem-loop scanning (SLS) - identified another set of putative
honey bee miRNAs. This approach does not simply flag
regions with propensity to form stem loop structures of
appropriate length because there are thousands of such
regions in the 235 Mb of the sequenced honey bee genome.
Instead, Smith-Waterman alignments to regions of the Drosophila genome likely to form pre-miRNA structures were
used to filter and refine the list of putative SLS candidates in
honey bee.
Each putative miRNA precursor (pre-miRNA) identified by
any method was folded to verify the thermodynamic propensity of the pre-miRNA sequence to adopt appropriate hairpin
secondary structure - and to verify that the mature miRNA
resided in the stem of the hairpin. We identified putative
canonical honey bee miRNAs, but the MCE and SLS methods
also suggested a number of possible new miRNAs, present
but previously unrecognized in other genomes.
Consolidation of output from the MCE and homology-based
miRNA search methods provided a final set of 65 unique
miRNA candidate loci with 66 unique predicted miRNA models for experimental evaluation - including the best 25 predictions generated by MCE. This final set of 65 miRNA loci
included 6 putative miRNAs identified by either homology or
MCE methods, but also by the SLS process. However, none of
the candidates identified only by SLS were among the final set
of 65, or tested for expression in this study. Honey bee
miRNA candidates, including some potentially novel miRNAs
and a few honey bee orthologs of known miRNAs, are listed in
Additional data file 1. There were two variant mature and precursor miRNA models predicted by MCE and HOM for one of
the predicted miRNA loci. For each candidate honey bee
miRNA model, Additional data file 1 gives the prediction
method (HOM, MCE and/or SLS), miRBase designation if
available, sequences of the putative mature honey bee miRNA
and putative precursor region, genomic coordinates of each
occurrence of mature and putative precursor miRNA
sequences within the bee genome assembly release 4, location
relative to coding sequence (CDS) of the honey bee official
gene set [18] (intergenic, intronic, or overlapping a CDS), GC
content of the GC content domain in which the miRNA is
embedded (described in [15]), and folding energies. Folded
precursors for some of the novel miRNAs are shown in Additional data file 8.

Validation of honey bee miRNA candidates by RT-PCR

However, the complex overlap and antisense orientation of
these two predictions, and binding sites for both F- and D+
within each of C5152a and C5152b, prevent us from excluding
the possibility that only one is actually expressed in both
sense and antisense orientations.

We also analyzed the results of two whole-genome honey bee
tiling array experiments for evidence that our candidate miRNAs were expressed. Using RNA pooled from multiple tissues
and stages, genome-wide transcription, including intergenic
regions, was evaluated by hybridization to 36-mer probes.
Two strand-specific 36 nt oligonucleotide probes for every 46
bp of the honey bee genome were arrayed. The whole genome
tiling array was hybridized in two separate experiments with
two different pooled polyadenylated RNA samples; but the
second experiment contained pooled RNA enriched for brain
and thorax.
For each candidate miRNA, tiling probes in a genomic region
containing its precursor sequence flanked by 50 bases on
both 5' and 3' ends were examined. A miRNA was considered
expressed if at least one probe within the chosen region measured signal above 90% of all tiling probes from the entire
genome. Twenty-six miRNAs, listed in Additional data file 6,
measured strong signal in either of the tiling array
experiments and six in both. Among the latter six, C4222,
C6617 and ame-mir-100 exhibited differential signal strength
in the two tiling array experiments.

interactions

Tiling array experiments measure genome-wide expression
patterns in an unbiased manner. In several organisms, signals from tiling arrays were observed in numerous noncoding
regions of the genome, suggesting the presence of noncoding
RNA, including tRNAs. Notably, tRNAs are approximately
the same size as miRNA precursors [21]. However, neither
pre-miRNAs nor mature miRNAs will be polyadenlylated.
Thus, use of polyA RNA in these experiments therefore biased
the RNA samples against mature miRNAs. Consequently,
failure of some RT-PCR validated miRNAs to be detected as
tiling array signals is not surprising. Conversely, there was
difficulty in assigning statistical significance to the observed
tiling array signals because the array experiments were
designed to detect longer protein-coding genes. Therefore,
there were too few probes (approximately 3-4) for each

C5152a and C5152b are discrete miRNA predictions in physical proximity on opposite strands (shown in Additional data
file 1) and both yield good hairpin predictions (Additional
data file 8). C5152b is similar, but not identical, to Drosophila
dre-ame-190. :Expression of C5152a and C5152b by RT-PCR
was tested using multiple primers, and both F- and D+ primers showed expression (Additional data file 3). Primers F- and
D+ were designed to amplify the mature miRNAs predicted
for C5152a and C5152b, respectively (Additional data file 2).

deposited research

We found 25 potentially novel miRNAs by MCE, of which 17
were tested by qRT-PCR. Twelve of these were expressed in
one or more tissues, stages, castes or pooled RNA samples,
while four had no detectable expression (C2327, C4131,
C5267 and C6617). Nevertheless, three of the RT-PCR negative candidates showed evidence of transcription in the tiling
array data (C4131, C6617 and C5267).

Overall, we provide evidence of transcription for most of the
novel MCE predictions, including roughly two-thirds of novel
candidates amenable to RT-PCR testing. Predicted expression levels were correlated between assays involving RNA
extracts biased toward small species using either selective
precipitation or electrophoretic separation (Table 1; Additional data file 3). Additional candidates will likely be confirmed as having transcription using other techniques and
honey bee tissues or life stages.

reports

Table 1 shows normalized expression levels across a pool of
larvae and adult bee samples for 30 candidate miRNAs. Some
candidates were queried with multiple primers in order to
test for strand-based expression and to distinguish between
expression of precursor and mature miRNA sequences, leading to a total of 45 presented primers. Another 23 primers
either generated artifactual PCR products in water or oneprimer controls, or failed tests of amplification linearity. In
general, candidates tested with forward and reverse primers
showed much higher expression of one strand. As a methodological control showing strand specificity, primers for two
variants of U4 spliceosome RNA (C5581a and C5581b)
showed strong expression in the predicted reverse direction
while a forward-oriented primer for C5581b showed almost
no expression. Expression for this locus was marginal when
the narrow (enriched for 18-30 nucleotide (nt) species) RNA
pool was queried. Primers that matched mature miRNAs
tended to generate stronger signal, especially when testing
the gel-purified (18-30 nt) RNA extractions. Alignments of
the tested primers to candidate miRNAs appear in Additional
data file 2 and a gel showing quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)
products from the 18-30 nt size selected RNA is found in
Additional data file 9.

reviews

A variety of techniques are available for miRNA detection and
validation, including hybridization techniques such as Northern blots and techniques using PCR (reviewed in [19]). We
employed the RT-PCR technique described by Shi and Chang
[20] to verify transcription of many of the candidate honey
bee miRNAs we describe. In brief, this protocol invokes the
polyadenylation of extracted RNA (in our case, after sizeselection for small RNA species by either glass-fiber substrate
binding or separation using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) followed by reverse-transcription primed by a poly(T)
adapter. MiRNA-specific forward primers are then paired
with a primer complementary to the RT adaptor for quantitative PCR amplification.

GO analysis revealed the following: 'Physiological process' as
the only GO term overrepresented among genes <10 kb from
bee miRNAs in every replicate experiment; 'Response to
stess' overrepresented in every replicate experiment for genes
<20 kb from bee miRNAs; no GO term overrepresented in
every replicate <50 kb from bee miRNAs; 'Nucleus' overrepresented in every replicate <100 kb from bee miRNAs. Running GeneMerge on a negative control set consisting of
randomly selected bee genes yielded no GO terms with significant Bonferroni corrected E-scores.

refereed research

We reasoned that an analysis of overrepresented Gene Ontology (GO) [24] terms associated with genes near miRNAs
might offer additional insights into function for some bee
miRNAs, and allow us to examine broad patterns of functional conservation between bee miRNAs and Drosophila
miRNAs. We first determined the GO slim terms (a more general subset of GO terms) associated with the Drosophila
ortholog of each bee gene [15]. Then using GeneMerge [25],
we determined GO slim terms that were overrepresented
among the set of bee genes occurring <10, <20, <50 or <100
kb from a predicted mRNA, compared with the set of all bee
genes with Drosophila orthologs. Because some bee genes
have multiple orthologs to Drosophila, and to ensure that our
GO enrichment analysis was not biased by random selection
of one to many fly orthologs of bee gene near miRNAs, we performed ten GeneMerge replicate experiments at each distance and report only GO terms whose Bonferroni corrected
E-socres were less than 0.05 in all ten replicates.

Gene Ontology analysis

reports

MiRNAs are often clustered within the genomes of mammals
and flies, and this clustering is often associated with co-transcription of miRNAs and genes with which they are in close
proximity [22]. The co-transcription of miRNAs and nearby
genes may also reflect coordinate regulation of miRNAs and
nearby genes. In particular, intronic miRNAs are often,
though not invariably, coordinately expressed with their host
gene and transcribed as a single primary transcript [23]. In
support of the postulated role of miRNAs in regulating the
alternative developmental trajectories associated with caste
differentiation, we examined the functional role of honey bee
official gene set genes in which intronic honey bee miRNAs
are embedded [18]. Given the paucity of direct functional evidence for most genes in honey bees, we relied upon a comprehensive set of computational orthologs described elsewhere
[15]. We discovered several notable relationships that will
merit additional investigation. First, there were associations
with fundamental cellular machinery of growth and development. Ame-mir-34, ame-mir-277 and ame-mir-317 all occupy
intron 3 of GB10191. GB10191 is the ortholog of Rbp8 in Drosophila, and RPB8 in humans - part of the RNA polymerase
II core complex and intimately involved in all transcriptional

Intriguingly, the functional processes of other genes hosting
intronic miRNAs suggest some bee miRNAs may be implicated in important but more complex caste differences. For
instance, novel candidate miRNA C689 is found within
GB10066, the bee ortholog of neuroligin, implicated in nervous system development. Novel miRNA C1504 is embedded
in GB11212, whose Drosophila ortholog is involved in the dorsal/ventral patterning, expressed in wing discs, and negatively regulated by Ultrabithorax. Candidate C5267 is
contained in GB15446, whose Drosophila homologs are regulators of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoters,
and involved in eye development and other morphogenic
interactions. Novel candidate C5599 is found within
GB14516, the ortholog of Dll (Distalless), which has transcription factor activity and is intimately involved in proximal/distal pattern formation and morphogenesis, especially
antennae and genitalia formation. Bee miRNAs may also be
involved in programming behavioral response repertoires, as
GB15597 harbors miRNA C4222, and its fly ortholog is eag,
implicated in behavioral responses, including sensory perception of smell and flight.

comment

We hypothesized that miRNAs might be involved in the dramatic developmental fate changes associated with the switch
from a reproductive female to a sterile worker female caste.
Accordingly, RNA was isolated from various tissues and
stages of both queen and worker honey bees and characterized by RT-PCR. Figure 1 and Additional data file 10 contrast
expression levels for a subset of the candidate miRNA loci in
adult head, thorax, abdomen and whole pupae, for both
queens and workers. Several candidates showed differential
expression between queens and workers in the abdomen,
arguably the body part that is physiologically most distinct
between these castes due to their different fecundity. Candidate loci ame-mir-9a, C3345, and C5152 were more strongly
expressed in worker abdomens, while C1504 and ame-mir-71
were more strongly expressed in queen abdomens. Ame-mir71 also had far stronger expression in developing (pupal)
workers than in queens and in worker thoraces. A more complete summary of RT-PCR experiments for this subset is
shown in Additional data file 4. In agreement with our
hypothesis that computationally predicted honey bee miRNAs could be implicated in bee development, and particularly
in the changes that characterize alternative fates of worker
and queen, many miRNAs display tissue, stage or casterelated expression patterns. Additional data files provide the
values of RT-PCR transcription estimates for pooled RNA
(Additional data file 3) and additional queen/worker samples
(Additional data file 4), primer sequences employed for
experimental evaluation (Additional data file 5), and alignments of the primers to the precursor sequences (Additional
data file 2).

We detected transcription of mature miRNAs as well as some
pre-miRNAs. Generally, putative mature miRNA transcript
abundance exceeded the level of precursor transcripts. Primers for mature miRNAs also tended to show the strongest
effects of transcript direction (for example, ame-mir-279;
Table 1), and retained strand-specific expression levels when
the 18-30 nt RNA pool was assayed. Nevertheless, tests at a
number of candidate miRNAs indicated fairly similar (<5fold difference) transcription levels for both RNA strands (for
example, ame-mir-1). Due to the small sample sizes, we have
highlighted only the more extreme expression differences,
although, as has been shown in expression studies of protein-

The honey bee genome [15] offers a rich resource for investigation of the genomic networks and emergent systems that
characterize sociality and enable coherent operation of the
complex web of interactions in the hive. However, the significant level of sequence divergence of honey bee from Drosophila and mosquito, and the absence of closely related
genome sequences suitable for phylogenetic shadowing can
impede genomic comparisons involving bees. We turned evolutionary distance to our advantage, reasoning that strongly
conserved sequences in an appropriate length range (MCEs)
might represent previously undiscovered miRNAs (the MCE
algorithm) [17]. In addition, we exploited the secondary
structure characteristics of most confirmed miRNAs, and the
conservation of core microprocessor components in bee, like
Drosha, to identify other candidates that would adopt pre-

The SLS output contained five predictions with significant
similarity to the HOM output (ame-mir-13a, ame-mir-276,
ame-mir-305, ame-mir-92 and ame-mir-9a) and only two
predictions with significant similarity to the top 25 MCE candidates, both of which were variants of C5152. Of these SLS
predictions, only ame-mir-9a and C5152 were tested for
expression by RT-PCR, and both were validated. The tiling
array evidence we accumulated also suggests that mir-305 is
expressed. The SLS output included several novel pre-miRNA
predictions that contained apparent repeat motifs and are
unlikely to be true miRNAs. However, other SLS candidates
may represent new miRNAs and future experiments will
more systematically assess evidence of expression for some of
them.

Discussion

Among those novel miRNA predictions we tested, we
observed only one false positive candidate identification by
MCE. C5581 was predicted as a miRNA, but that sequence is
homologous to a U4 splicing RNA. There was one case in
which two methods predicted slightly different miRNAs at
overlapping genomic coordinates. Mature ame-mir-137,
identified by HOM, is completely identical over the 22 nt that
it overlaps with the 27 nt of mature C5303, predicted by MCE.
We observed two cases where different miRNA predictions
occurred at overlapping genomic coordinates, but the opposite strand: C5152a/C5152b (primers F- and D+) and amemir-9b/ame-mir-79. In both cases, at least one of the opposing strand pair was identical or similar to a known mature
miRNA. Predicted ame-miR-9b and ame-mir-79 are identical
to known miRNAs. Predicted mature C5152b is similar, but
not identical to Drosophila dme-mir-190; C5152b is longer
than dme-mir-190, and differs at only three nucleotides internally. These may be examples of miRNA sense/antisense
transcription.

Compared to bee, there were far more GO terms that were significantly enriched among genes near miRNAs in the Drosophila genome. For example, four GO slim terms
('Development', 'Morphogenesis', 'RNA binding' and 'Signal
transduction') were overrepresented in all replicates at every
distance in Drosophila, and there were 29 GO terms significantly enriched among genes <100 kb from fly miRNAs
(Additional data file 7). In contrast, in the bee genome, there
were no GO terms enriched at every distance, and only 1 GO
term ('Nucleus') enriched among genes <100 kb from bee
miRNAs. This disparity between bee and Drosophila is likely
caused by the increased sensitivity in the Drosophila experiment compared to the bee experiment. The Drosophila
experiment used Drosophila GO annotations directly,
whereas the bee experiment relied on the existence and detection of Drosophila orthologs for each bee gene.

miRNA hairpin structures, and produce significant SmithWatermann alignments between putative bee and Drosophila
miRNAs (the SLS algorithm).

reviews

To compare GO terms associated with these miRNAs in bee
and fly, we conducted a similar analysis of Drosophila genes
near miRNAs. We obtained GO slim terms associated with
Drosophila genes occurring <10, <20, <50 or <100 kb from
Drosophila orthologs of these bee miRNAs, and ran GeneMerge to find overrepresented GO terms. As before, only GO
terms whose Bonferroni corrected E-scores were less than
0.05 in all ten replicate experiments are reported. The GO
experiment data are summarized in Additional data file 7.
Interestingly, the GO term 'Physiological process', which was
overrepresented among bee genes <10 kb from miRNAs was
also overrepresented among Drosophila genes <20, <50 and
<100 kb from miRNAs. As before, running GeneMerge on a
negative control set consisting of randomly selected Drosophila genes yielded no GO terms with significant Bonferroni corrected E-scores.

encoding transcripts in bees, even subtle differences in transcript abundance could play important roles in development.
It is possible that actual mature miRNA for those candidates
that did demonstrate expression may differ slightly from the
mature miRNA we predicted. For example, a variant of the
primer for candidate ame-mir-7 (ame-mir-7.F) indicated a
very strong transcript level, while a primer with one more 3'
nucleotide (T; miR-7M112R) gave no product. Thus, we
showed that our RT-PCR technique was very sensitive to
small primer sequence differences, as shown in plant miRNAs by Shi and Chang [20].
Likewise, the strongest expression product observed
(C5560F) was primed by a forward primer that stopped one
base short of the 5' end of the predicted mature miRNA (Additional data file 2). Because it is possible that the actual novel
mature miRNA sequences may differ slightly from the
sequence of the candidate mature miRNA primers we tested,
we cannot unequivocally reject those candidate miRNAs for
which we did not obtain reproducible expression patterns.
Honey bee genomic study is still young, but initial observations offer some clarity and focus for further investigation.
First, with a few notable exceptions (for example, odorant
receptor genes and genes involved with innate immunity),
there are as yet few potential relationships between gross
genomic features and the social organization of bees [15]. In
fact, the emergence of social life and its manifestation in bees
may rely mainly on fairly subtle genomic interactions that
affect gene network organization, regulation and expression
patterns. In support of this hypothesis, previous work suggests that the development of distinct reproductive castes
(workers and queens) in honey bees reflects the differential
regulation of well-established developmental genes, rather
than that of a parallel set of caste-specific genes [26,27].
We submit that miRNAs and their combinatorial interactions
with overlapping and independent target gene sets may offer
a tractable means to aid the evolution of sociality, by stabilizing the alternative developmental programs that generate
distinct castes from a uniform genetic groundplan. Thus, the
evolution of distinct reproductive and sterile castes might
proceed from the loss or acquisition of miRNA binding sites
in the 3' UTRs of particular genes by drift or selection, coupled with divergent temporal or spatial expression of miRNAs
between workers and queens. In fact, it has recently been suggested that miRNAs may be understood as contributing to
canalization and genetic buffering of gene regulatory networks by interacting with transcription factors in coherent
and incoherent feed-forward loops to stabilize phenotypic
variability [28]. However, we need not posit that miRNAs act
as direct switches for differential developmental pathways.
The same canalizing effect could be achieved with miRNAs
acting as global regulators of tissue identity and gene expression breadth and specificity. Indeed, the properties that make
miRNAs attractive candidates as stabilizers of phenotypic

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/6/R97

variability would also allow miRNAs to modulate emergence
of different phenotypes upon alternative spatial or temporal
expression in different castes. Two candidates showed especially strong expression differences between identical tissues
from bee queens and workers (Figure 1). Ame-mir-9a.F was
expressed most strongly in worker versus queen thorax and
abdomen. Candidate 5152a was overexpressed in queen versus worker head, then showed the opposite pattern in the
abdomen.
We also present many unrecognized miRNAs in honey bee
and show that some of them, as well as other canonical miRNAs, appear to be transcribed in a stage-, tissue- or caste-specific manner (Figure 1). In fact, the genomic location of many
of the most strongly caste, stage or tissue biased miRNAs,
coupled with known functional activities of some miRNAs in
other species, orders and phyla, allow inferences regarding
the roles these caste- or stage-biased miRNAs may play in
honey bees. For instance, we find that ame-mir-9a is among
the most strongly caste-biased miRNAs, with much higher
expression levels in adult worker thorax and abdomen than
similar queen tissues, but higher levels of mir-9a occur in
queen pupae (Figure 1). Interestingly, mir-9a controls sensory organ precursors (SOPs) in Drosophila, with loss of mir9a function resulting in ectopic production of SOPs, while
overexpression of mir-9a yields a severe diminution of SOPs.
Mir-9a is also expressed at high levels in epithelial cells adjacent to SOPs in proneural clusters, suppressing sens through
miRNA/target interactions in the sens 3' UTR, and inhibiting
neuronal fate in non-SOP cells [29]. This suggests possible
roles for ame-mir-9a in influencing caste differences in honey
bees. Another example is C1504.F, which is expressed in
higher levels in queens than workers (Figure 1) and is nested
within the honey bee ortholog of the RNA binding protein
gene, CG32062. Expression of CG32062 in Drosophila is
dependent upon Notch-mediated signaling from the DorsoVentral organizer (D/V) boundary, and repressed by the
homeotic gene, Ultrabithorax. The product of CG32062 likely
constitutes a second long-range D/V morphogen, independent of Wingless (Wg) [30]. MiRNAs in other organisms are
often organized in clusters that lie in physical proximity in the
genome, and may be present in multiple copies too. In D. melanogaster, the proapoptotic K-box miRNA mir-2, and mir-13
occur jointly. The same relationship holds in bees, and amemir-71 is also present within this same region (Table 1). In
fact, even with a relatively fragmented genome consisting of
over 9,000 scaffolds, we can discern that the honey bee harbors several linked sets and/or multiple copies of miRNAs.
They include ame-mir-1, which is near ame-mir-133. We note
that mir-1 and mir-133 are co-located in physical proximity in
organisms as diverse as honey bees, frogs, mice and men, and
are well-documented regulators of myogenesis in other
organisms [31]. Ame-mir-1 and ame-mir-133 may exhibit
similar functions in honey bees. Other examples of clustered
miRNAs or multicopy miRNAs include: novel miRNA C5152a
antisense to C5152b; novel C5303 overlapping ame-mir-137;

ame-mir-9b overlapping the ame-mir-79 locus, but on the
opposite strand; ame-mir-12 near ame-mir-283; ame-mir275 near ame-mir-305; ame-mir-277 near ame-mir-317 and
ame-mir-34; C1504 near ame-mir-375; and ame-let-7 on the
same scaffold as ame-mir-100. Two of the most interesting
cases involve multiple miRNAs in the introns of single genes.
Ame-mir-277, ame-mir-317 and ame-mir-34 occur in the
same intron of GB10191 - a core component of the RNA
polymerase II complex. Finally, three copies of ame-mir-2,
plus one instance each of ame-mir-13a and ame-mir-71, all
occur within intron 3 of GB15727 - a serine/threonine phosphatase lost from Drosophila, but with both vertebrate and
more ancient metazoan orthologs.

morphism between highly fertile, long-lived queens and
largely sterile workers. Differences in miRNA expression
observed in homologous tissues of queen and worker may
help provide insights into gene regulation during the remarkable developmental switch characterizing caste differences in
the honey bee.

Our first strategy for identifying novel miRNAs invoked
BLASTN searches of known miRNAs from miRBase release
8.0 [16] against the honey bee genome (Assembly release 4.0)
using wordsize 7 and E-score threshold ≤0.1. These searches
identified several hundred candidate bee miRNAs with significant matches to miRNAs from other species. A sliding window of 110 nt with increments of 3 nt was scanned along the
sequences extracted at 100 nt upstream and downstream of
each match. Windows were scored for folding energy (at least
25 Kcal/mol) using RNAFOLD [32], then for base pairing and
position of putative mature miRNA along the stem. Candidates with at least 16 bases paired to the opposite strand were
considered putative mature regions. Windows that passed
this scoring scheme were visually inspected for proper
folding.

information

For the third strategy we applied a novel algorithm, SLS, to
the entire honey bee genome to identify sequences that would
adopt appropriate hairpin secondary structure. In the SLS
method, overlapping 100 nt segments of the genome are analyzed for sequences that can form loops similar to those seen
in known miRNAs. In detail, each 100 nt segment was aligned
to its reverse complement using a modified Smith-Waterman
alignment algorithm (G::T pairing was penalized less than
other mismatches). Good alignments were tested to determine if they would form a stem and a loop with size typical of

interactions

Our second strategy relied on three-way, all against all,
genomic comparisons of D. melanogaster, A. gambiae and A.
mellifera to identify probable honey bee miRNA candidates
[17]. Hundreds of microconserved MCE sequences identified
in this way included more than 40% of previously validated
Drosophila miRNAs, and this set seems likely to contain
additional and novel miRNAs shared by bee and Drosophila.
The secondary structural features of known pre-miRNAs in
Drosophila are expected to be characteristic of novel premiRNAs of bee as well, because the genes involved in processing primary RNA transcripts into mature miRNAs in Drosophila are conserved in honey bee. Consequently, secondary
structures of candidate bee miRNA precursors were screened
for proper folding and thermodynamic stability typical of
Drosophila miRNA precursors, and putative mature miRNAs
were eliminated if they did not lie within the stem regions of
the pre-miRNA hairpins, according to the criteria previously
proposed by Ambros et al. [33]. Ground-state energies and
structures were computed with the Vienna Package [34].

Not surprisingly, the honey bee genome contains numerous
candidate miRNAs that can be identified by computational
methods. We show that some honey bee candidates identified
in this way have been overlooked in other genomes. Some
novel and canonical miRNA transcription levels differed
strongly across the tested tissues and samples. Honey bees
and other social insects are defined by a developmental poly-

reports

The sensitivity of the GO experiment in bee was limited by a
number of factors. The GO analysis considers only those bee
genes with recognizable orthologs in Drosophila, and the GO
annotation for bee genes was always based upon functional
evidence from Drosophila. Furthermore, in honey bee, the
GeneMerge E-score for GO terms present in every experiment
varies somewhat depending upon the particular Drosophila
ortholog selected for use in GeneMerge, at least when there is
more than one Drsophila ortholog. While 'Development',
'Morphogenesis', 'RNA binding' and 'Signal transduction'
were overrepresented in every Drosophila experiment at all
distances, there are no GO terms overrepresented in every
bee experiment at each distance. Therefore, we suggest that
the lack of enrichment for these same GO slim terms in the
bee experiment may reflect the lack of a complete gene list in
honey bee, the paucity of direct functional evidence for honey
bee genes, and the reliance upon Drosophila orthology and
GO annotation for bee genes. As honey bee genome annotation and functional genomics proceeds, further GO analysis
may reveal additional functional attributes for honey bee
miRNAs.

Weaver et al. R97.9

reviews

That fact that we found three GO terms ('Physiological process', 'Nucleus' and 'Response to stress') that were overrepresented among genes near miRNAs in both the Drosophila and
bee genome demonstrates that some miRNAs function in the
same or similar functions in Drosophila and bee. Furthermore, this result allows us to ascribe roles for honey bee miRNAs in processes relevant to these GO terms. Future studies
of the specific genes near these miRNAs and annotated with
these GO terms may help elucidate how these miRNAs function in honey bee.

known miRNAs. Specifically, stems had to be 20-25 bp, and
loops had to be 4-35 nt. Candidate sequences were then subjected to thermodynamic testing using Mfold [35] to determine free energy values. Those with folding energies less than
-20 kcal/mole were discarded. This entire process was performed on both the honey bee and Drosophila genomes.
Putative miRNAs from honey bee that aligned well to putative
miRNAs from Drosophila were saved as candidate miRNAs.

Transcriptional analyses: RT-PCR
RNA was extracted and enriched for short transcripts using a
variant of the RNAqueous (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) protocol. Honey bee tissues (head, thorax, and abdomen from
queens and workers, and whole bodies from queen and
worker prepupae) were ground in 200-600 μl lysis grinding
buffer depending on tissue volume. This suspension was
diluted in an equal volume of 64% EtOH and then spun
through the provided filter columns. The flow-through, containing smaller RNA species, was then mixed with a 70% volume of isopropanol and passed through a second filter
column in order to trap the now-precipitated small RNAs.
After prescribed wash steps, RNA was eluted from this second
column in 50 μl sterile H2O. RNA size range and quantity was
estimated using an Agilent 9000 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). A second extraction was carried out as above for queen and worker head, thorax, and
abdomen, as well as third-instar larvae and prepupal bees.
This extraction was separated using a 15% denaturing (TBEurea) polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
RNA species 18-30 nt in length were cut from the gel, eluted
as a group using a FLASHPAGE mini-electrophoresis unit
(Ambion), purified by EtOH precipitation, and resuspended
in 50 μl sterile H2O.
Contaminating DNA was removed by exposing 2 μg of each
total RNA pool to 10 U DNaseI with appropriate buffer
(Ambion) in the presence of 20 U RNAsin (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Samples were incubated 1 hour at 37°C,
then 75°C for 15 minutes. Polyadenylated tails were added to
all transcripts using a 15 μl reaction containing 2 μg total
RNA, 2 U E-PAP enzyme with appropriate 1× buffer
(Ambion), 4 mM MnCl2, and 1.7 mM ATP. Samples were
incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. cDNA was prepared from 0.4 μg
polyadenylated RNA template in a 15 μl reaction containing
10 pmol oligo-dT linker (5'GCG AGC ACA GAA TTA ATA CGA
CTC ACT ATA GGT12 VN) and 2 mM dNTP. The reaction was
heated to 70°C for 10 minutes and placed on ice. After preheating to 42°C for 2 minutes, 4 μl of reverse transcriptase
mix, containing 50 U Superscript II in appropriate buffer and
reagents (Invitrogen) was added. Synthesis was carried out at
42°C for 50 minutes, followed by 15 minutes at 70°C.

based on the predicted mature or precursor RNA sequences
(Table 1). The 25 μl reaction mixes consisted of 1 U Taq DNA
polymerase with appropriate buffer (Roche), 1 mM dNTP
mix, 2 mM MgCl2, 1× SYBR Green dye (Molecular Probes,
Eugene, Oregon, USA), 10 nM Fluorescein calibration dye
(Biorad), and 0.2 μM of each forward and reverse primer. The
thermal program for all reactions was 95°C for 30 s followed
by 40 cycles of (95°C for 30 s, 60°C for 30 s, 72°C for 30 s,
76°C for 10 s immediately after the extension step for fluorescence capture). Melt-curve analysis and agarose gel analyses
were used to test whether PCR products were the appropriate
size (gel products 60-80 bp, dissociation temperatures 7681°C). In addition, qPCR runs using negative (no template)
templates, as well as miRNA forward primers without the
adaptor primer, were used to exclude primers that showed
signs of spurious amplification (n = 23).
Threshold cycle (CT) values for each miRNA were subtracted
from the mean CT values for all miRNAs surveyed in a given
cDNA. Amplification efficiency (serial dilution) analyses suggested that these PCR reactions were highly efficient and,
accordingly, relative abundances were calculated as 2δCT.
While the low replicate number precludes statistical analyses,
means and standard deviations are presented for the two
sample replicates in order to indicate sample variability.

Gene ontologies of miRNA-regulated genes
To determine the functional categories of bee and fly genes
under control of miRNAs, we looked for GO terms [24] overrepresented among genes in close proximity to putative miRNAs in the Drosophila and bee genomes. GO slim terms and
annotations for D. melanogaster genes generated at FlyBase
[36] were obtained from the Gene Ontology Consortium website [37]. GO terms were assigned to genes of the honey bee
Official Gene Set [18] using D. melanogaster orthologs,
which were identified as described by the Honey Bee Genome
Sequencing Consortium 2006 [15]. In cases where more than
one fly ortholog existed for a given bee gene, a random fly
ortholog was selected independently in each replicate experiment. GeneMerge [25] was then run using test sets of genes
<10 kb, <20 kb, <50 kb or <100 kb from putative miRNAs
and their associated GO slim terms, and a population set consisting of all mapped bee genes with fly orthologs (for the bee
experiment) or all mapped fly genes (for the fly experiment).
Ten replicate experiments were conducted for both fly and
bee analyses, and only GO terms whose Bonferroni corrected
E-scores were less than 0.05 in all ten replicate experiments
were considered significantly overrepresented. For negative
control experiments, GeneMerge was run on a test set of randomly selected bee or fly genes equal in number to the set of
bee or fly genes <10, <20, <50 and <100 kb from a putative
miRNA.

The above cDNA was diluted 1:5 and used as the template for
amplification in an iCycler real-time PCR thermalcycler (Biorad, Hercules, CA, USA). Gene specific primers for approximately two thirds of the putative miRNAs were designed

comment

The following additional data are available with the online
version of this article. Additional data file 1 provides a complete listing of candidate miRNAs, including miRBase designation, the sequence of the putative mature honey bee
miRNA, the sequences 110 nt up- and downstream of each
mature miRNA candidate (putative precursor region), the
genomic coordinates of each occurrence of mature and putative precursor miRNA sequences within the bee genome
assembly release 4, whether the candidate miRNA is intergenic, intronic, or overlapping a CDS, the GC content of the
GC content domain in which the miRNA is embedded
(described in [15]), and folding energy. Additional data file 2
provides alignments of primers to precursor miRNAs. Double
strands of precursors are shown, with mature miRNA indicated as lower case embedded in the sense strand, which is
otherwise uppercase. Note that reverse primers are shown in
the 3' to 5' direction, to show alignment to the sense strand.
Additional data file 3 provides qPCR expression results from
gel-purified 18-30 nt RNA extractions from pooled tissues
(head, thorax, and abdomen from queens and workers, and
whole bodies from queen and worker prepupae). The ID column corresponds to gel lanes in part b in Additional data file
9. CT is a predetermined threshold at which fluorescence from
PCR products exceeds background fluorescence. Additional
data file 4 provides mean expression values for queen and
worker honey bee tissue-specific samples. Additional data file
5 provides the primers employed in expression analyses, and
expression estimates for pooled samples. Additional data file
6 provides miRNA tiling array probes with hybridization signal in the top 10% of tiling array results in two independent
experiments. The RNA sample from array B had a higher concentration of bee brain and thorax than the first. Additional
data file 7 provides GO analysis of genes located within 10, 20,
50 and 100 Kb of miRNAs. There is a different worksheet containing the results of 10 replicates each, for honey bee and
Drosophila. Each worksheet provides E-score, Bonferroni
Corrected E-score, and GO term. Additional data file 8 shows
folded hairpins for precursors of novel honey bee miRNAs.
Additional data file 9 provides two figures: Figure A shows a
15% PAGE separation of small-enriched RNAs from honey
bee queen head, thorax, and abdomen, and worker head, thorax, and abdomen. RNA sized at 18-30 nt was excised from
the gel and purified for qPCR as described in the text. The left
lane shows a 10 nt RNA size marker, with the 10 nt band at
bottom left. Figure B shows the size variation of PCR products
generated from small-enriched RNA pools and candidate
primers. Most products were approximately 75-90 bp in
length. Alphanumeric label refers to sample ID as described
in Additional data file 3. Additional data file 10 shows normalized expression across worker and queen samples for
additional miRNA candidates. Values indicate relative
expressions levels as log10 scale, with SD for three sample replicates, as described in the text.
