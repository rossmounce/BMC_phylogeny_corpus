Abstract
Background: In San Luis Potosí City cervical infection by human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16)
associated to dysplastic lesions is more prevalent in younger women. In this work HPV16 subtypes
and variants associated to low-grade intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), high-grade intraepithelial lesions
(HSIL) and invasive cervical cancer (ICC) of 38 women residing in San Luis Potosí City were
identified by comparing their E6 open reading frame sequences.
Results: Three European (E) variants (E-P, n = 27; E-T350G, n = 7; E-C188G, n = 2) and one AAa variant (n = 2) were identified among the 38 HPV16 sequences analyzed. E-P variant sequences
contained 23 single nucleotide changes, two of which (A334G, A404T) had not been described
before and allowed the phylogenetic separation from the other variants. E-P A334G sequences
were the most prevalent (22 cases, 57.9%), followed by the E-P Ref prototype (8 cases, 21.1%) and
E-P A404T (1 case, 2.6%) sequences. The HSIL + ICC fraction was 0.21 for the E-P A334G variants
and 0.00 for the E-P Ref variants.
Conclusion: We conclude that in the women included in this study the HPV16 E subtype is 19
times more frequent than the AA subtype; that the circulating E variants are E-P (71.1%) > E-T350G
(18.4%) > E-C188G (5.3%); that 71.0% of the E-P sequences carry the A334G single nucleotide
change and appear to correspond to a HPV16 variant characteristic of San Luis Potosi City more
oncogenic than the E-P Ref prototype.

Background
Human papillomavirus (HPV) types differ from each
other by at least 10% of the L1 gene open reading frame
(ORF) sequence [1,2]; differences among subtypes are
2%–10%, and less than 2% among variants [1,3-6]. E6

gene sequences can also be used to identify HPV types,
subtypes and variants [7].
Persistent infection by high risk-HPV, among which
HPV16 is the predominant type, can progress to invasive

cervical cancer. The risk of cervical cancer increases with
certain HPV16 subtypes [8,9] whose prototype is the
European (E-P Ref) subtype [7,10]. Sixty-percent of invasive cervical cancer cases in Mexican women 35 years old
or younger are attributed to the Asian-American (AA)
HPV16 subtype [11-13], whereas in invasive cervical cancer cases of younger women in Mexico City the AA subtype is 21 times more frequent than the E subtype [14].
Invasive cervical cancer is a public health problem in the
state of San Luis Potosí, whose mortality rate in 2005 was
above the national average and occupied the tenth place
among the 32 federated states [15]. In San Luis Potosí
City, the state capital, infection by HPV16 has the highest
prevalence [16] and precancerous and cancerous lesions
of the cervix are more prevalent in the youngest women
(R. López-Revilla and L. Rosales-Ortuño, unpublished
data), suggesting that a more oncogenic HPV16 variant
may be circulating there.
In this work we identified the HPV16 subtypes and variants in cervical precancerous and cancerous lesions from
women residing in San Luis Potosí City by comparing the
amplified E6 ORF sequences with those of the HPV16
classes represented in GenBank.

Results
Study population
The 38 women included in the study were randomly
selected among San Luis Potosí City residents with cervical infection by HPV16 demonstrated by nested PCR
amplification of the E6 ORF [16]. Their age range was 22
to 45 years (mean ± SD = 33.2 ± 5.9 years). Twenty seven
(71.1%) had low-grade squamous cervical intraepithelial
lesions (LSIL), eight (21.1%) had high-grade squamous
cervical intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), and three (7.9%)
had invasive cervical cancer (ICC).
Identification of HPV16 subtypes and variants
The 5'-termini of the deposited sequences were aligned to
start at nucleotide 83 of the E-P genome, the first one of
the ATG start codon of the E6 open reading frame (ORF),
and their upstream portions were ignored. Lengths of the

deposited sequences ranged from 337 to 576 bp (average
= 541 bp). All sequences were longer than the 477 bp
expected for the complete E6 ORF, except HPV16-27 (377
bp), HPV16-9 (436 bp), and HPV16-21 (465 bp). The
GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession numbers of the 38
sequences of this study, EU880235 to EU880272, are
depicted in Table 2.
HPV16 subtypes and variants were identified by comparing their sequences with that of the E6 ORF of the HPV16
E-P Ref prototype variant [7]. The HPV16 subtypes identified are listed in Table 2. The predominant one is the
European subtype (E) with 36 cases (94.7%); the two
cases of the Asian-American (AA) subtype represent 5.3%
of the total (Table 2).
The frequency of HPV16 variants identified is shown in
Fig. 1. For the E subtype the most frequent was the E-P Ref
variant with 27 cases (71.1%) followed by the E-T350G
variant (seven cases, 18.4%) and the E-C188G variant
(two cases, 5.3%). AA-a was the only AA variant (two
cases, 5.3%).
Novel HPV16 E6 variants identified
In the E6-HPV16 ORF sequences, 24 single nucleotide
changes that had not been described before were found
(Table 3); 21 of them (13 substitutions, 6 insertions, 2
deletions) appeared once in nine sequences; the remaining three were observed in two sequences. The A404T
change was observed in a single E-P variant.

In 13 sequences there was a deletion of two neighboring
bases (AC) located in nucleotide positions 56 and 57,
immediately before the ATG protein start codon. The
A334G synonymous substitution was found in 22
sequences, located next to nucleotide 335, commonly
used for subtype-variant identification.
Amino acid sequences of the E6 oncoprotein encoded by
the samples analyzed were compared with the E-P Ref
sequence to identify non synonymous mutations (Table
3). E-T350G variants had the expected substitution of leucine for valine at position 83 (L83V). The expected amino

HPV16 variants identified In San Luis Potosi City. The
sequences of two cases corresponded to the AA-a variant of
the Asian-American subtype whereas the 36 remaining cases
corresponded to the European subtype (E). Within the E
subtype the predominant variant was E-P (n = 27), followed
by variants E-T350G (n = 7) and E-C188G (n = 2).

acid changes were also found in AA-a (Q14H; H78Y;
L83V) and E-C188G variants (E20Q; L83V). Deletion of
nucleotide 484, identified in one of the two AA-a variants
implies the frameshift in the E6 ORF starting at amino
acid 127. The A404T change identified in a single sample,
produced the I101F change. The C37A change identified
in an E-P variant produced the change Q91K. The C206T
change present in an E-T350G variant generated a stop
codon instead of amino acid 35 and T351A caused the
L83E change in the same sample. The C173A substitution
produced the H24N change in one sequence, and the
A182T the I27L
changes
in
another one.
Phylogenetic analysis
Identical dendrograms were generated with the 38 E6-2
nucleotide sequences using the Phylip and MEGA programs. Comparing all sequences it was not possible to
resolve the A404T non synonymous mutation as a group
independent of the E-P Ref sequence. A tree was thus constructed with the six E6-HPV16 ORF sequences representing each of the variants identified, including those
containing the single nucleotide changes A334G and
A404T. The optimal tree with branch length = 0.01907
was drawn to scale with the same evolutionary distance
units used to infer the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2). In this
way the AA-a variant and the three known E-P variants (EP Ref, E-T350G and E-C188G) could be related, with two

Phylogenetic treeORF sequencesvariants formed with six repPhylogenetic tree of the HPV16 variants formed with
six representative E6-2 ORF sequences. Numbers to
the right of each branch indicate the identity of the cervical
samples; the name of the variant is at the right of the identity
number. Capital letters to the extreme right indicate the
HPV16 European (E) or Asian-American (AA) subtype to
which the variants belong. This optimal phylogenetic tree was
constructed to scale, with branch lengths having the same
units as the evolutionary distances used to infer them. Note
that sequences with the A334G and A404T single nucleotide
changes (framed) identified for the first time in this work, as
well as the already known C188G, T350G variants are close
to the E-P Ref (P) prototype variant.

The proportion of HSIL and ICC lesions ("HSIL + ICC
fraction") associated to the 19 A334G variants (0.21) was
clearly higher than that associated to the eight E-P Ref variants (0.00). Although the HSIL + ICC fraction was even
higher for the AA-a, E-T350G and E-C188G variants, the
number of samples of these variants were too small to
reach definitive conclusions on their oncogenicity (Table
4).

Discussion
HPV16 is the viral type with the highest association to
HSIL and ICC; it was one of the first HPV's to be
sequenced [17,18], and it is well known that infection by
certain HPV16 subtypes and variants can lead to faster disease progression in younger women [19,20].

HPV subtypes have been identified by comparing the
sequences from the E6 and L1 genes and of the long control region (LCR). In the case of HPV16 the E6 gene is frequently used because a short and continuous fragment of
its sequence contains sufficient information to identify all
the subtypes and variants that have been described
[10,21-24]. HPV16 subtypes differ in prevalence, biochemical and biological properties (e.g., replication and
expression of AA E6 and E7 oncogenes is more efficient)
with uncertain implications in cervical cancer aetiology
[12,25-27].
In this work, the first to approach HPV molecular phylogeny in Central Mexico, we identified HPV16 subtypes and
variants by comparing the E6 ORF sequences [7]. Through
the use of nested PCR enough E6-2 DNA was obtained to
sequence the amplified samples. Amplicon length was
heterogeneous because the length of the product ends is
variable with the sequencing method used [28]. Sequence
analysis confirmed that all samples correspond to HPV16,
supporting the specificity of the PCR-RFLP method [29]
we used for genotyping [16].
Among the HPV16 E6-2 amplicon sequences, 36 corresponded to the E subtype and two to the AA subtype. No
African subtypes were identified, as has been the case in
previous studies performed in Mexico City [12,14].
Berumen et al. [14] found a 1.1% prevalence of the
HPV16 AA subtype in controls and 23.2% in ICC cases in
Mexico City, whereas del Refugio Gonzalez-Losa et al.
[12] did not find the HPV16 AA subtype. These differences
are probably due to the severity of the lesions included
since the group of samples analyzed by Berumen et al.
[14] had ICC, whereas in this work LSIL predominated.
We identified four HPV16 variants in San Luis Potosi City:
E-P (n = 27, 71.1%), E-T350G (n = 7, 18.4%), E-C188G (n
= 2, 5.3%) and AA-a (n = 2, 5.3%), whereas Berumen et al.
[14] observed frequencies of 47% for the E-T350G and
8% for the E-350T variants. The contrast in the variety of
subtypes and variants found by us probably derive also
from differences in the kind of lesions as observed above;
however, it cannot be ruled out that specific population
features can be involved, since we have already found
divergence among HPV type frequencies in the neighboring Mexican states of San Luis de Potosí and Guanajuato
[16] which also differ from those observed in Mexico City
[12,14].
Besides the known point mutations characteristic of the
HPV16 variants identified by us, we detected 24 novel single nucleotide changes, two of which appeared in a considerable proportion of the sequences analyzed. The non
synonymous A404T substitution, observed only in one

http://www.infectagentscancer.com/content/4/1/3

sequence close to the E-P Ref, generates the I101F amino
acid change in the E6 protein. The second most frequent
novel change, observed in 13 cases (34.2%), consists in a
deletion of two contiguous bases (AC) in the nucleotide
positions 56 and 57 located in the 5'-untranslated region
of the E6 gene.
The synonymous A334G, the most frequent of the novel
single nucleotide changes found in 22 E subtype
sequences (57.9%) is phylogenetically close to the E-P Ref
prototype and appear to identify an HPV16 variant characteristic of the region. The E-P A334G variant appears to
be more oncogenic, because the proportion of HSIL and
ICC lesions were clearly higher for them than with the EP Ref variants (Table 4). To verify if E-P A334G sequences
indeed correspond to a new variant, the complete viral
genome must be cloned and sequenced [1].

Conclusion
HPV16 subtypes and variants infecting the cervix of 38
women from San Luis Potosí City, Mexico, were identified
by comparing the sequences of E6 ORF nested PCR products; 36 sequences corresponded to the E subtype and two
to the AA subtype.
Three variants of the E subtype were identified: E-P (n =
27, 71.1%), E-T350G (n = 7, 18.4%), E-C188G (n = 2,
5.3%). The only AA variant identified was AA-a (n = 2,
5.3%).
Besides the known point mutations of the E variants identified, 24 novel single nucleotide changes were detected.
The most frequent of the novel changes, found in 19 E
subtype sequences, is the synonymous A334G which
appears to identify an HPV16 variant characteristic of the
region.
The second most frequent novel change, observed in 13 E
subtype sequences, is a deletion of two contiguous bases
(AC) in nucleotide positions 56 and 57 of the E6 5'untraslated region.

Methods
DNA from cervical scrapings
Randomly selected cervical lesion samples from 38
women residing in San Luis Potosí City, with HPV16
infection diagnosed in our laboratory [16], had been
obtained by one of us (JOV) at the Colposcopy Clinic,
Secretaría de Salud, San Luis Potosi City.

Each scraping was taken with an endocervical brush
('cytobrush') that was immediately inserted into a 5 mL
polypropylene tube (Nalge Nunc, Rochester, NY) containing 1 mL phosphate buffered saline (PBS: 137 mM NaCl,

2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 2 mM KH2HPO4, pH 7.4)
supplemented with sterile 25 mM disodium ethylenediaminotetraacetate (EDTA), pH 8.0 (PBS-EDTA). Once
detached from the cytobrush and suspended in the PBSEDTA vehicle, each sample was fixed by addition of 1.5
mL 96% ethanol and processed to extract DNA on the
same day or up to 30 days after being kept at room temperature. Reagents were purchased from J.T. Baker (Xalostoc, Mexico) unless other source is specified.
To extract the DNA, each fixed sample was mixed by vortexing and 1 mL transferred to a 1.5 mL tube and spun in
a Hettich Mikro 20 microcentrifuge (Cologne, Germany)
for 5 min at 13,000 rpm (16,250 × g). The supernatant
was discarded by decantation and to each pellet were
added 500 μL of Tris-EDTA-saline (TES: 10 mM Tris-HCl;
2 mM disodium EDTA, 0.4 M NaCl, pH 8.0 at 25°C), 50
μL of 10% sodium dodecyl sulphate and 20 μL of proteinase K (20 mg/mL). Mixtures were incubated at 55°C for
3 h, at the end of which 150 μL of 5 M NaCl were added
and centrifuged again for 15 min. Each supernatant was
aspirated and transferred to a tube to which 577 μL cold
isopropanol were immediately added and then left stand
for 10 min at 4°C to precipitate the nucleic acids. The
tubes were centrifuged again for 10 min and the supernatants discarded by decantation. Each pellet was washed by
vortexing with 1 mL of 70% cold ethanol and centrifuged
for 10 min at 10,000 rpm (9,615 × g) and room temperature. Supernatants were discarded by aspiration and the
pellets dried out by inverting the tubes for 15 min on a
paper towel. Each pellet was dissolved with 50 μL TE (10
mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM disodium EDTA, pH 8.0 at 25°C).
DNA quality was verified by electrophoretic analysis in
1% agarose gels with TAE buffer (40 mM Tris-acetate, 1
mM disodium EDTA, pH 8.2 at 25°C). Two-μL from each
sample were applied to gels which were run at 60 V for 90
min. λ-phage DNA digested with Hind III (Sigma-Aldrich,
Mexico) was used as marker. After staining for 20 min
with ethidium bromide (1 μg/mL) gels were transilluminated with ultraviolet light and their fluorescence
recorded with the Bio-Rad ChemiDoc EQ (Hercules, CA)
photodocumenter.
DNA was quantified by fluorometry with the PicoGreen
dsDNA Quantitation kit (Molecular Probes; Eugene, OR)
by interpolation in a standard curve containing up to 50
ng of λ-phage DNA. To each well of a black FIA 96 well
plate (Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhausen, Germany) 198 μL
of the assay solution (PicoGreen diluted 1:400 in TE) and
2 μL of standard DNA or problem samples were added,
and their fluorescence determined using a 485 nm excitation filter and a 535 emission filter in the GENios Pro
fluorometer (Tecan Systems, San Jose, CA) with the Magellan 4 software.

Direct and nested PCR
Nested PCR was used to generate enough DNA to
sequence the E6-HPV16 ORF [16]. The E6-1 product
(~650 bp) was preamplified with the LCRS/E7AS primer
pair in the first reaction (PCR1), and the E6-2 product
(~626 bp) with the E6F/PU-2R16 primer pair in the second reaction (PCR2) (Fig. 3, Table 1). PCR1 mixtures of
50 μL contained 2 mM MgCl2, the four deoxinucleotide
triphosphates (0.4 mM each), forward and reverse primers (0.6 μM each), 1.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase and 25
ng of cervical DNA in 200 mM Tris-HCl 500 mM KCl, pH
8.4. Mixtures were preamplified by incubation in a Touchgene Gradient (Techne) thermocycler with initial denaturation at 94°C by 4 min, 40 cycles of amplification (1 min
denaturation at 94°C, 1 min annealing at 55°C 1 min
extension at 72°C) and 10 min final extension at 72°C.
To generate E6-2, to PCR2 mixtures (same composition as
PCR1 mixtures except for primers and DNA) 1 μL of each
preamplified PCR1 mixture was added as template.
Amplification products were electrophoresed in high-resolution sodium borate (SB)1% agarose gels [30].

The intensity of E6-2 bands generated by nested PCR was
highest in the presence of 2 mM MgCl2, which was used
in all subsequent amplification experiments. In a pilot test
E6-2 bands were amplified by direct PCR in positive controls (pHPV16 and pHPV18) and in 23 out of 28 (82.1%)
cervical samples. In view of these results we decided to
amplify all samples through nested PCR.
E6-1 was preamplified in PCR1 mixtures with the LCRS/
E7AS primer pair and E6-2 in PCR2 mixtures with the
internal E6F/PU-2R16 primer pair. In this way conspicuous E6-2 bands were obtained from all samples with

yields sufficient (> 1500 ng) to sequence the amplicons
(Fig. 4).
The pHPV16 and pHPV18 plasmids containing the complete genomes of HPV16 and HPV18 respectively,
donated by Dr. Alejandro García Carrancá (Instituto
Nacional de Cancerología, Mexico City), were used as
positive controls. PCR mixtures without DNA were used
as negative controls.
Identification and phylogeny of HPV16 subtypes and
variants
The DNA purified with the Wizard kit (PCR Preps DNA
Purification Systems, Promega, Madison, WI) from 40 μL
of PCR2 mixtures was used to sequence the positive and
negative strands of E6-2 amplicons with the method of
Sanger et al. [28] at the National Laboratory for Genomic
Biodiversity (Guanajuato campus of CINVESTAV, Mexico) and compared with the E6 ORF of the major HPV
branches (E, AA, Af1, Af2) by multiple alignment with the
ClustalW v1.82 software [31]. Viral subtypes and variants
were identified by comparing the E6-HPV16 ORF nucleotide sequences published by Yamada et al. [7]. Allocation of nucleotide and amino acid positions in the E6HPV16 ORF was based on the nucleotide sequences [32].
Amino acid sequences of the E6 oncoprotein were predicted with the Translate program tool of the ExPASy database [33].

Their evolutionary history was inferred using the UPGMA
method [13]. Evolutionary distances were computed
using the 2-parameter method [34] whose units are the
number of base substitutions per site. Codon positions
included were first + second + third + noncoding. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated
from the dataset (complete deletion option); there were a
total of 477 positions in the final dataset. Phylogenetic
analyses were conducted in MEGA4 [35].
