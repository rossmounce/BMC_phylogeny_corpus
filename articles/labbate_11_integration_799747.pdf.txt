Integration of a laterally acquired gene into a cell
network important for growth in a strain of Vibrio
rotiferianus
Maurizio Labbate1, Yan Boucher2, Piklu Roy Chowdhury1 and Hatch W Stokes1*

Abstract
Background: Lateral Gene Transfer (LGT) is a major contributor to bacterial evolution and up to 25% of a
bacterium’s genome may have been acquired by this process over evolutionary periods of time. Successful LGT
requires both the physical transfer of DNA and its successful incorporation into the host cell. One system that
contributes to this latter step by site-specific recombination is the integron. Integrons are found in many diverse
bacterial Genera and is a genetic system ubiquitous in vibrios that captures mobile DNA at a dedicated site. The
presence of integron-associated genes, contained within units of mobile DNA called gene cassettes makes up a
substantial component of the vibrio genome (1-3%). Little is known about the role of this system since the vast
majority of genes in vibrio arrays are highly novel and functions cannot be ascribed. It is generally regarded that
strain-specific mobile genes cannot be readily integrated into the cellular machinery since any perturbation of core
metabolism is likely to result in a loss of fitness.
Results: In this study, at least one mobile gene contained within the Vibrio rotiferianus strain DAT722, but lacking
close relatives elsewhere, is shown to greatly reduce host fitness when deleted and tested in growth assays. The
precise role of the mobile gene product is unknown but impacts on the regulation of outermembrane porins. This
demonstrates that strain specific laterally acquired mobile DNA can be integrated rapidly into bacterial networks
such that it becomes advantageous for survival and adaptation in changing environments.
Conclusions: Mobile genes that are highly strain specific are generally believed to act in isolation. This is because
perturbation of existing cell machinery by the acquisition of a new gene by LGT is highly likely to lower fitness. In
contrast, we show here that at least one mobile gene, apparently unique to a strain, encodes a product that has
integrated into central cellular metabolic processes such that it greatly lowers fitness when lost under those
conditions likely to be commonly encountered for the free living cell. This has ramifications for our understanding
of the role mobile gene encoded products play in the cell from a systems biology perspective.

Background
The integron includes a site-specific recombination system that integrates and expresses genes present on
mobile elements called gene cassettes [1]. The integron
platform is defined by three characteristics: an integrase
gene (intI) whose product encodes a site-specific integrase, IntI, an attachment site (attI) at which point
DNA sequences are inserted and a promoter (Pc) which
expresses genes within the gene cassettes inserted at attI

[2]. Gene cassettes can be inserted into the integron as
individual units but multiple events can lead to large
tandem arrays. Integrons are best known for their role
in the spread of antibiotic resistance genes in clinical
environments [3]. These clinical integrons harbour 1-6
gene cassettes and are often associated with mobile elements such as resistance plasmids and transposons [3].
However, integrons are diverse genetic elements found
in approximately 10% of environmental bacteria [2]. In
these bacteria, integrons are found in chromosomal
locations and rarely carry antibiotic resistance gene cassettes indicating a general role in evolution.

Vibrio is a genus of highly adaptable bacteria found in
diverse marine-associated niches [4]. This adaptability is
partly driven by lateral gene transfer (LGT), a process
believed to be particularly important in this genus since
the recent finding that Vibrio cholerae and other vibrios
naturally take up DNA from the environment [5,6]. In
the vibrio, integron cassette arrays can comprise well in
excess of 100 cassettes [7]. Thus, the integron is a significant source of laterally acquired DNA in vibrio consisting of 1-3% of the total genome and generates
genetic diversity even among closely related strains [2].
For example, it is the only identified genomic region
that differs between some strains responsible for the
current V. cholerae pandemic [8]. It has also been
recently suggested that integron associated gene pools
in the vibrios are important in adaptation to local environmental and ecological conditions [9].
Recent additional studies have provided new insight
into the biology of vibrio integrons. The SOS stress
response induces transcription of the integron-integrase
increasing the rate of insertion, excision and shuffling of
gene cassettes [10]. Furthermore, the majority of gene
cassettes in a 116-cassette array [11] located in the
Vibrio rotiferianus strain DAT722 [12] were found to be
transcribed due to the presence of promoters distributed
throughout the array [13]. Thus, cassette transcription is
not absolutely dependent on being near Pc. Collectively
these findings suggest the integron provides a more prominent role in vibrio adaptation than previously
thought.
Approximately 75% of integron associated gene cassette products in Vibrio species are novel with the
remainder being designated with a putative function
based on the presence of known domains through in
silico analysis [2] or, to a very limited extent, by protein
structural analysis [14]. The novelty of gene cassette
products has made them difficult targets to study. However, like most mobile DNA, gene cassettes are believed
to provide their host with accessory phenotypes imparting a niche-specific advantage. The exemplar of this
phenomenon is antibiotic resistance, where most of the
genes driving resistance adaptation are highly mobile
[15]. This has also been supported by the handful of
novel gene cassettes that have been characterised proving them to be functional and include genes potentially
involved in pathogenesis in V. cholerae [14,16-18]. It is
easy to understand how a protein carrying out a single
biochemical reaction, for example the chemical inactivation of an antibiotic, can act in isolation and confer a
strong selective advantage when the containing cell is in
an environment where a toxic compound is present.
This argument can also be extended to self contained
sets of genes (operons) that encode pathways conferring
resistance to such things as mercury and chromate

which have also been captured and spread by mobilizing
elements. It is largely believed that highly mobile genes
would be confined to such function-types since laterally
acquired genes that influence core metabolic functions
are likely to lower fitness when first captured [19]. However we show here that at least one of eight novel cassettes associated with a vibrio integron encodes a
product that is integrated into cell membrane porin regulation such that its loss would impact on cell fitness
under physiological conditions that would normally be
encountered by the free living host.

Results
Deletion of cassettes reduces growth on some carbon
sources

To investigate how cassette genes may influence adaptation in their bacterial host, deletions of cassettes were
created in the integron cassette array of Vibrio rotiferianus DAT722. Two cassette deletion mutants within the
116-gene cassette array of Vibrio rotiferianus DAT722
were created (See Methods and Figure 1). These
mutants removed cassettes 8-60 (designated d8-60a) in
one case and cassettes 16-60 (d16-60) in the other. The
ability of these mutants to grow in various media were
tested and compared to the wild type parent (Figure 2).
It was found that both mutants were able to grow normally in a complete medium (LB20) albeit with a
slightly extended lag phase for d8-60a (Figure 2A). The
two mutants were also examined for growth in marine
minimal medium (2M salts, a medium that mimics marine seawater [20]) with glucose (Figure 2B) or pyruvate
(Figure 2C) as a sole carbon source. The growth of both
mutants was normal compared to wild type (Vibrio rotiferianus DAT722) in 2M + glucose as was also the case
for d16-60 in pyruvate. In contrast, d8-60a grew very
poorly with pyruvate as sole carbon source. Growth of
this mutant however could be restored on pyruvate with
the addition of glycine-betaine, a known osmoprotectant
(Figure 3). Glucose is also known to be a better osmoprotectant than pyruvate and we therefore tentatively
conclude that the poor growth of d8-60a in pyruvate is
a result of intolerance to osmotic changes and not a failure to extract carbon from this molecule. Further
growth experiments supported this hypothesis with
growth on other carbon sources that osmoprotect (eg
trehalose) compared to failure to grow on other nonosmoprotectants (aspartic acid, glutamic acid, succinate
and fumarate) (data not shown). These data suggested
that this cassette array may include encoded proteins
that integrate into and influence cellular processes more
broadly in contrast to possessing proteins involved in
single step secondary metabolism. Specifically, in
DAT722, at least one cassette product appears to influence normal growth under nutrient conditions

The numbers below each cassette indicates its position in the array relative to attI. The white (group 1) and grey cassettes (group 2) indicate the
two groups of paralogous cassettes described in the Materials and Methods section. Not all cassettes are shown with gaps of missing cassettes
marked with a ~ symbol. A 1834 bp DNA fragment consisting of, in order, a portion of the white paralogous cassette sequence (448 bp), the
aphA1 gene from pLOW2 (964 bp) and a portion of the grey paralogous sequence (410 bp) was cloned into the suicide vector pCVD442 to
create pMAQ1081 (B). Plasmid pMAQ1081 was conjugated into Vibrio sp. DAT722-Sm resulting in a single crossover at cassette 61 creating strain
MD7 (C). Counterselection of MD7 with sucrose medium resulted in isolation of deletion mutants that had undergone a second crossover with
cassette 15, creating mutant d16-60 and deletion of cassettes 16 to 60 (C, i), with cassette 7 resulting in mutants d8-60a, d8-60b and d8-60c and
deletion of cassettes 8 to 60 (C, ii).

analogous to those found in seawater, the natural freeliving environment for Vibrio rotiferianus.
To confirm that the dramatic reduction in fitness of
d8-60a was a result of the loss of a mobile cassette and
not the consequence of a spontaneous mutation elsewhere in the genome of the isolate selected for analysis,
two other independent mutants, d8-60b and d8-60c,
comprising loss of the same cassettes were constructed
and examined for their growth characteristics. The
results for these two mutants showed significant growth
impairment in minimal medium although not in a manner identical to d8-60a. In glucose, both d8-60b and d860c had significant lag phases of up to 14 hours compared to wild type DAT722 and d8-60a but thereafter
grew to achieve wild type cell densities at 24 hours (Figure 2B). In pyruvate, d8-60b and d8-60c showed
reduced growth rates compared to DAT722 although
they were significantly better than d8-60a (Figure 2C).
All three d8-60 mutants generated a minority of
microcolonies when streaked on LB20 complete medium (Figure 4). This suggested that the mutants had an
overall reduced fitness that was strongly selective for
mutants that compensated for loss of a function
encoded within the region deleted. The nature of these
compensating mutations may thus explain the variability

of growth seen between mutants in minimal medium. In
support of the notion that compensating mutations
were being selected out was the observation that cells
recovered from microcolonies that showed enhanced
growth showed wild type equivalent growth in minimal
medium + glucose. This is shown in cell lines d8-60b-S
and d8-60c-S in Figure 2D. Taking these data together
we suggest that an integron associated cassette product
participates in some aspect of cell metabolism that
directly or indirectly impacts on growth such that a secondary mutation(s) is required to maintain viability or
growth. This product must be encoded by one of the
genes located in cassettes 8 to 15 inclusive since the
smaller deletion encompassing cassettes 16-60 does not
display any of these effects (Figure 2).
Cassette deletions change the outermembrane protein
profiles of cells

Porins play a major role in controlling the permeability
of the outermembrane of Gram-negative bacteria.
Changes in porin composition affect the cell’s osmotic
balance and nutrient transport [21]. Therefore, it was
hypothesized that the likely osmotic shock of d8-60a in
2M + pyruvate and the growth defects of d8-60b and
d8-60c in 2M + glucose might be due to changes in the

composition of outermembrane porins. Outermembrane
protein profiles showed significant changes in the composition of porins in all three d8-60 mutants compared
to the wild-type using different growth media indicating
an inability of these mutants to regulate their porins
normally (Figure 5A, B and 5C). In 2M + glucose conditions, d8-60a showed slight decreases in four proteins
identified as VapA (the structural subunit of a twodimensional lattice in the outer membrane called the Slayer; band 1), maltoporin (band 2), OmpU porin (band
3) and an OmpU-like porin (band 4) compared to the
wild-type, consistent with the healthy growth of d8-60a
in this medium (Figure 5A). However, the changes in
regulation of porins in d8-60a was clearly observed
when grown in 2M + LB nutrients as it showed
increased amounts of VapA (band 1) and maltoporin
(band 2) and the presence of a putative porin (band 4)
not detected in the wild-type under these nutrient conditions (Figure 5C). This irregular regulation explained
the inability for d8-60a to grow in 2M salts without the
presence of an osmoprotectant such as glycine-betaine
or glucose to restore the osmotic balance.

The mutants d8-60b and d8-60c had very similar
porin profiles, a result consistent with the similar
growth phenotypes displayed by these mutants. In 2M +
pyruvate conditions, a significant down-regulation of the
maltoporin (band 2) and the OmpU-like porin (band 5)
but an up-regulation of OmpU (band 3) was observed
when compared to the wild-type (Figure 5B). In 2M +
LB nutrient medium, these mutants had reduced levels
of the maltoporin (band 2) and the presence of the
putative porin (band 4) protein in replacement of the
OmpU-like porin (band 5) compared to the wild-type
(Figure 5C).
Expression of a single gene cassette in trans maintains
normal growth after generation of strains with deleted
cassettes

Since mutant d16-60 (cassettes 16 to 60 deleted) had
normal growth phenotypes compared to the wild-type,
at least one cassette gene located between cassettes 7
and 16 has a strong pleiotropic affect. All eight cassettes
within this region, except cassette 11, encode small
hypothetical proteins with homology only to other

cassette proteins. Therefore, nothing could be inferred
regarding their putative function. However, cassette 11
includes a gene, encoding a 257 amino acid protein with
pfam http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/ identifying two domains;
1) an uncharacterized NERD domain at residues 31-150
that has weak homology to nucleases and is commonly
associated with other protein domains involved in DNA
processing [22], 2) a DNA-binding C4-zinc finger
domain at residues 216-257 found in topoisomerase I
proteins and involved in removing excessive negative
supercoils from DNA [23]. Based on this bioinformatics
analysis one possible biochemical function of the cassette 11 gene product is as a DNA topoisomerase. In
addition, experiments with a mutated topoisomerase I
(topA) gene have described phenotypes that are similar
to those observed in the d8-60 mutants. Most notably,
in characterized topA mutants, this includes the requirement for a compensatory mutation, emergence of spontaneous mutants and alterations in the composition of
outermembrane porin proteins [23-28].
To test for the cassette 11 gene product being responsible for the phenotype of the mutants described above,
the plasmid pMAQ1082 was constructed which comprises only this cassette gene cloned into the vector
pJAK16 (Methods). pMAQ1082 was then transformed
into the merodiploid strain MD7. MD7 has a complete

DAT722 cassette array and is the strain that was used
to create the original deletion mutants (Methods and
Figure 1). MD7/pMAQ1082 possesses a phenotype identical to that of DAT722 with respect to porin profiles
and growth in LB20 and 2M media. From this strain, a
deletion mutant was created, DAT722Δ/pMAQ1082
with the same cassettes deleted as strains d8-60a, b and
c. The strain DAT722Δ/pMAQ1082 had no major
growth defect (Figure 6) and possessed a wild type outermembrane protein profile in all tested media (Figure
5D, E, F). A slight decrease in growth rate was observed
in 2M + pyruvate (Figure 6), which may be explained by
the up-regulation of a protein (Figure 4F; marked with
an asterisk) that is likely due to cassette 11 being
removed from its native promoter.

Discussion
The integron/gene cassette system is broadly dispersed
amongst the Proteobacteria and is found in about 10%
of sequenced genomes [2]. In the vibrios it is ubiquitous
with arrays generally being especially large. Despite the

fact that the integron gene cassette “metagenome” pool
is very large [29,30], little is known about what the
encoded proteins do beyond the enormous contribution
some cassette proteins make to the antibiotic resistance
problem [31]. A conventional understanding of cell
metabolism would suggest they encode accessory phenotypes providing their host with a niche-specific advantage. Antibiotic resistance is a classic example of this
since cassettes containing antibiotic resistance genes
quite clearly provide a selective advantage in clinical
environments where antibiotics are frequently used [31].
These highly mobilized genes frequently cross phylogenetic boundaries and a single gene can protect a cell

from toxic compounds irrespective of the metabolic
context in which it finds itself. The same phenomenon
can extend to some adaptive genes that are part of a
“self contained” unit as is the case, for example, in operons on transposons that confer mercury resistance [32].
The vibrios represent a diverse group of marine
organisms and members of this group have very large
cassette arrays. A typical vibrio cassette array comprises
more than 100 novel genes [7]. Moreover, they represent the most dynamic component of the genome. In V.
cholerae, pandemic strains that are otherwise indistinguishable by most phylogenetic typing techniques can
still have very disparate cassette arrays [8]. Similarly,

this is true for enclosed symbiotic communities of
vibrios [33]. This highly mobile pool of genes, in a
metagenomic sense, therefore number in at least the
thousands and probably orders of magnitude more [29].
What do all these genes do? Many probably comprise
functions that are metabolically independent of the rest
of the cell in a manner analogous to antibiotic and
heavy metal resistance genes. However, we show for the
first time, that at least one mobile gene product can
influence other aspects of core cell metabolism. In
DAT722 this influence is such that at least one gene
within the deleted region is highly adapted to this cell
line to the extent that its loss reduces fitness to the
point where the host cell is barely viable. The target
gene or genes was contained to within a contiguous set
of eight cassettes within the DAT722 array. Each of
these cassettes contained a single predicted protein (Figure 1 and [11]). All of the predicted proteins are novel
in that identical proteins are not present in any other
known bacterium. Further, seven of the eight predicted
proteins are highly novel to the point where they can
only be described as hypothetical proteins. The remaining predicted protein, derived from cassette 11, is also
novel although it contains a domain related to the DNA
topoisomerase I family of proteins.
Although the precise function of this cassette protein
needs to be established experimentally, the data generated was consistent with the hypothesis that the cassette
11 gene product was integrated into an essential cell network in the wild type DAT722. In particular, the fact that
supplying this product alone in trans via pMAQ1082 preserved the wild type phenotype after subsequent deletion
of cassettes 8 - 16 unambiguously points to an essential
role in the cell porin regulatory network.

Conclusions
Overall, this study emphasizes the importance of LGT in
bacterial evolution and that this process can bring rapid
adaptation not only through acquisition of novel functional genes, but more importantly through gain of
genes that alter a cell’s regulatory network. Thus, mobile
genes can be adaptive over very short time scales such
that their loss can threaten the viability of the cell
through the disruption of a core metabolic process. This
is in contrast to the generally held view that mobile
DNA contributes to cell fitness by providing additional
protein/s that act largely independently of core cell networks. Also, this data reinforces the point that large
integron arrays are not solely dependent on Pc for transcription since this cluster of genes if relatively distal to
this promoter. It is clear therefore that despite the enormous increase in genomics and proteomic data in recent
years, much is still to be learnt about the full of gamut
of proteins necessary for important cell metabolic
processes.
Methods
Strains, growth conditions and DNA purification

Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are
listed in Table 1. Vibrio strains were routinely grown on
Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with 2% NaCl
(LB20). Escherichia coli strains were routinely grown on
Luria-Bertani medium. Growth curves of all vibrio
strains were conducted in 100 ml flasks containing 25
ml of medium. The inoculum was from overnight cultures grown in LB20 and then diluted to OD600 of 0.7
using 2% NaCl. Growth curve cultures were inoculated
at 1:100. In experiments comparing growth of the wildtype and deletion mutants with different carbon sources,
a marine minimal salts medium (2M) which mimics a
seawater environment [20] was used supplemented with
a carbon source (glucose and pyruvate at 11.1 mM and
20 mM respectively). Since growth of the d8-60 mutants
in 2M was dependent on the added carbon source, 2M
supplemented with LB nutrients (10 g tryptone and 5 g
yeast extract per litre) was used to compare the outermembrane protein profiles of all mutants. In vibrio,
kanamycin, chloramphenicol and streptomycin were
used at 100 μg/ml, 12.5 μg/ml and 25 μg/ml respectively. In E. coli, kanamycin, chloramphenicol and ampicillin were used at concentrations of 50 μg/ml, 25 μg/ml
and 100 μg/ml.
V. rotiferianus DAT722 was isolated from a mud crab
aquaculture tank in Darwin (Northern Territory, Australia) [11]. It was typed by multi locus sequence analysis
of the recA, pyrH, rpoA, topA, ftsZ and mreB genes
(data not shown). Transformation of E. coli XL1-Blue
was performed as previously described [34]. Genomic
DNA (gDNA) was extracted from overnight cultures

created by amplifying the cassette 11 gene from V. rotiferianus DAT722 using primers B-VSD11-F and PVSD11-R (Table 2). The resulting amplicon was directionally cloned in front of the lac promoter using
BamHI and PstI. pMAQ1082 was conjugated into MD7
in a triparental conjugation using RK600 as the helper
strain.
DAT722 cassette analysis and strain construction

The cassette array of DAT722 is fully sequenced [12]
and consists of 116 gene cassettes although there are 94
different cassette types due to the presence of paralogous cassettes [11]. For the deletion of cassettes by
homologous recombination, the presence of paralogous
cassettes in different positions of the array was
exploited. Two of the paralogous cassette types were
selected based on their position in the array. The first
paralogous cassette type (group 1) is in positions 6, 7,

15, 27, 49, 66, 71, 76, 77 and 111. The second paralogous group (group 2) is in positions 34, 61, 83, 87, 90,
93 and 105. Using fusion PCR, a 1834 bp DNA fragment consisting of, in order, a portion of group 1
sequence (448 bp), the aphA1 gene from pLOW2 (964
bp) and a portion of group 2 sequence (410 bp) was
amplified and cloned into pGEM-T Easy producing
pMAQ1080. The fragment was excised from
pMAQ1080 using salI and cloned into the salI site of
the sacB-counter selectable suicide vector pCVD442 to
create pMAQ1081. Homologous recombination (allele
replacement) was used to replace cassettes between
group 1 and group 2 cassettes with the 1834 bp fragment created by fusion PCR. Plasmid pMAQ1081 was
conjugated into DAT722-Sm using E. coli SM10 as a
donor with recombinants selected on LB20 medium
supplemented with 100 μg/ml and 25 μg/ml of kanamycin and streptomycin respectively. A merodiploid (designated MD7) was isolated with pMAQ1081 recombining
into cassette 61 of the integron cassette array (see Figure
1). An overnight culture of MD7 was inoculated into
fresh LB20 at a dilution of 10-6 and grown until turbidity was evident (~ 6 hours). For selection of double

cross-over recombinants, a dilution series of the MD7
culture was plated onto LB medium containing 0.4%
NaCl, 10% sucrose and 100 μg/ml kanamycin. Using primers targeting unique cassettes outside the expected
deletions (Table 2), colonies were screened for the presence of deletions between 6/7 and 61, 15 and 61, 27
and 61 and 49 and 61. In the case of the mutants d860a, d8-60b, d8-60c, all three generated identical length
PCR products by this method indicating identical deletion end points.
Membrane protein analysis

The outer membrane proteins (OMPs) were extracted
as previously described [35] using equal number of
cells (equivalent to 5 ml of cells diluted to an OD600 of
5.0). The membrane pellet was resuspended in 200 μl
of SDS sample buffer containing 5 mM tributylphosphine and 20 mM acrylamide for reduction and alkylation of proteins [36]. The solubilized proteins were
diluted 1:5 in SDS sample buffer and 5 μl subject to
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a Criterion
XT precast gel (4-12% Bis-Tris; Bio-Rad). Protein gels
were stained with Flamingo protein stain (Bio-Rad)
and imaged using a Pharos FX Plus Molecular Imager
(Bio-Rad). Flamingo stained protein gels were poststained with colloidal Coomassie G-250 stain and proteins of interest excised for identification by LC-MS/
MS as previously described [37]. PEAKS software
(Bioinformatics Solutions Inc.) was used to directly
search peptides against a protein sequence FASTA
output derived from the V. rotiferianus DAT722 genome [12]. The highest PEAKS score (percentage based
on a p-value < 0.05) was taken as the closest peptide
match. The full sequence of identified proteins is given
in the additional file 1.

Additional material
Additional file 1: lists the full sequence of outermembrane proteins
that showed changes in concentration between wild type DAT722
and the mutant d8-60a under particular growth conditions. Proteins
were identified via LC-MS/MS analysis as described in the methods.
