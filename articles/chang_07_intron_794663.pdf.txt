Abstract
Background: The somatic DNA molecules of spirotrichous ciliates are present as linear
chromosomes containing mostly single-gene coding sequences with short 5' and 3' flanking regions.
Only a few conserved motifs have been found in the flanking DNA. Motifs that may play roles in
promoting and/or regulating transcription have not been consistently detected. Moreover,
comparing subtelomeric regions of 1,356 end-sequenced somatic chromosomes failed to identify
more putatively conserved motifs.
Results: We sequenced and compared DNA and RNA versions of the DNA polymerase α (pol
α) gene from nine diverged spirotrichous ciliates. We identified a G-C rich motif aaTACCGC(G/
C/T) upstream from transcription start sites in all nine pol α orthologs. Furthermore, we
consistently found likely polyadenylation signals, similar to the eukaryotic consensus AAUAAA,
within 35 nt upstream of the polyadenylation sites. Numbers of introns differed among orthologs,
suggesting independent gain or loss of some introns during the evolution of this gene. Finally, we
discuss the occurrence of short direct repeats flanking some introns in the DNA pol α genes. These
introns flanked by direct repeats resemble a class of DNA sequences called internal eliminated
sequences (IES) that are deleted from ciliate chromosomes during development.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that conserved motifs are present at both 5' and 3' untranscribed
regions of the DNA pol α genes in nine spirotrichous ciliates. We also show that several
independent gains and losses of introns in the DNA pol α genes have occurred in the spirotrichous
ciliate lineage. Finally, our statistical results suggest that proven introns might also function in an IES
removal pathway. This could strengthen a recent hypothesis that introns evolve into IESs,
explaining the scarcity of introns in spirotrichs. Alternatively, the analysis suggests that ciliates might
occasionally use intron splicing to correct, at the RNA level, failures in IES excision during
developmental DNA elimination.

Background
Spirotrichous ciliates are intriguing because they carry out
elaborate genomic DNA rearrangements when they
develop their somatic nucleus, or macronucleus, from
their hereditary nucleus, or micronucleus. In the hereditary nucleus, macronuclear destined sequences (MDSs) in
the germline DNA are separated by noncoding, A-T rich,
internal eliminated sequences (IESs), each bounded by a
pair of direct repeats. Tens of thousands of IESs must be
removed during macronuclear development, while the
MDSs are "sewn together" leaving one copy of the pair of
direct repeats at the "stitch" (Fig. 1, see also Table 1). After
this event, the processed germline chromosomes undergo
first heavy fragmentation, then end-capping with telomeres, and finally differential replication, to give rise to the
macronuclear chromosomes or "nanochromosomes"
(Fig. 1). In spirotrichous ciliates, the order and orientation of MDSs in the micronucleus can be completely different than in the macronucleus, in the remarkable
illustration of "scrambled genes" [1].
The somatic macronucleus of spirotrichous ciliates contains millions of short macronuclear chromosomes ranging in size from ~400 to ~15,000 bp [2] and flanked by
(C4A4)nC4 telomeric repeats [3,4]. Macronuclear chromosomes often contain a single gene, although some cases of
multi-gene nanochromosomes have been reported [5-7].
A typical macronuclear chromosome contains the coding
region of a gene plus short noncoding regions at the 5'
and 3' ends.
Relatively little is known about the transcriptional structure and regulation of genes in spirotrichous ciliates,
including their promoter sequences, transcriptional start
sites, and signals that direct transcriptional regulation and
post-transcriptional processing. A study of 66 putative
protein-coding macronuclear molecules in spirotrichs
revealed that the 5' and 3' flanking sequences are less than
200 bp and A-T rich (> 70%) [8]. A more recent analysis
of 1,356 end-sequenced macronuclear chromosomes in S.
histriomuscorum (formerly Oxytricha trifallax) also yielded

similar conclusions [9], suggesting that signals for regulating transcription and/or translation, if any, are tightly
packed in relatively limited spaces compared to other
eukaryotes. However, the highly conserved eukaryotic
promoter sequence TATA(A/T)A(A/T) [10] has not been
consistently found in the 5' leader sequences, nor were
conserved polyadenylation signals found in the 3' trailer
sequences [2,8,11,12]. To date, only two cis-elements in
macronuclear chromosomes have been experimentally
confirmed: the heat shock responsive elements in Sterkiella nova (formerly Oxytricha nova)[13] and several
Euplotes species [14] and the chromosomal breakage signal in Stylonychia lemnae [15,16]. Other putative cis-motifs
deduced from multiple sequence comparisons include the
putative chromosomal breakage signal 5'-HATTGAAaHH3' (abbreviated using the IUPAC symbol H = not G) in
Euplotes crassus [17] and a conserved AAGATA sequence
present in 5' leader sequences of 24 completely sequenced
actin-encoding macronuclear chromosomes in spirotrichs
[18]. However, comparisons of more than 1,000 ends of
macronuclear chromosomes revealed no conserved motif
in the subtelomeric regions [9], with the exception of a
purine-bias in the first 50 bp that Prescott and Dizick proposed might signal a chromosomal breakage during
macronuclear development [19].
Spirotrichous ciliates generally contain few introns [2].
Known introns are present in both micronuclear and
macronuclear DNA and, like IESs, are also A-T rich but
bounded by canonical GT...AG splicing signals. An
extended spirotrich-specific intron consensus of
GTAAG...TAG has also been suggested [20,21]. Why
introns are scarce in these taxa is unknown. Thus the bioinformatic discovery of introns in the DNA polymerase
alpha gene [22] was unexpected.
In this study, we sequenced the genes and determined the
mRNA ends of nine diverged orthologs encoding the large
subunit of DNA polymerase alpha (pol α) in spirotrichous ciliates. We found a conserved motif aaTACCGCB
(B = not A) located upstream from the transcription start

development, long before transcription. Such a novel
pathway could explain the intron paucity observed in
spirotrichous ciliates. An alternative interpretation is that
some IESs might be selected to retain intron splicing signals, so that they can also be eliminated after transcription
if IES excision fails [22,23]. We have observed that IES
excision during macronuclear development is indeed
error-prone [23] (Mollenbeck et al. unpublished), which
makes such a mechanism for genome-wide intron/IES
surveillance appealing.

information is passed to soma (macronucleus). Genes, or

direct repeats (grey boxes). Intergenic noncoding sequences

site in each species. In addition, we also identified putative polyadenylation signals -10 to -15 bp upstream of the
polyadenylation sites. We experimentally confirmed that
introns in these genes were generally short, with the
exception of two longer introns in euplotids. By comparing the locations of these introns within the coding
region, our results suggest that independent gains/losses
of introns have occurred within the spirotrichous ciliate
lineage. Finally, we investigated the recurring and curious
observation in our data of direct repeats overlapping or
present near the exon-intron boundaries. Some of the
larger of these repeats are similar in length to those that
function in IES excision. We provide a statistical and bioinformatic analysis that shows that some of these direct
repeats are more common than expected when compared
to biologically constrained randomized genes. This result
could be interpreted as strengthening a recent hypothesis
(elaborated in [23]) that introns may evolve into internal
eliminated sequences (IES). This would lead to their deletion from somatic chromosomes during macronuclear

Features of the DNA polymerase α (pol α) gene of 9 ciliate
orthologs are listed in Figure 2. The macronuclear
sequences of this gene from two Euplotes spp. and
Eschaneustyla sp. are newly reported in this study. We
determined the mRNA ends from seven of the nine
orthologs and re-sequenced the corresponding macronuclear regions in order to avoid possible discrepancies
between RNA and DNA data due to strain differences or
alleles within a species. RNA samples from U. grandis and
Eschaneustyla sp. were not available; thus putative features
were inferred from sequence comparison to other species.
Conserved Motifs in 5' and 3' Flanking Regions of Nine Pol
α Orthologs
All transcription start sites (TSS) were found on adenosine
residues, preceded by a thymine base and followed by an
A-T rich region (Fig. 3a). With the exception of the TSS in
Holosticha, these sites are within the first 100 bp of subtelomeric DNA at the 5' end. In Holosticha, two other genes
are present on the same macronuclear chromosome,
upstream of the DNA pol α gene [6]. We searched 25 – 35
bp upstream of the TSS for "TATA box" sequences
(TATA(A/T)A(A/T)) [10] and found no strong match, in
agreement with conclusions of two previous studies
[8,11]. However, we consistently found one copy of a 9 bp
motif, aaTACCGCB, upstream of the TSS. This motif is
also present in U. grandis and in Eschaneustyla sp. (Fig. 2
and 3b). The distance between this motif and the TSS
ranges from 5 bp in E. octocarinatus to 34 bp in S. lemnae,
while the distance between the end of the 5' telomere and
the motif varies from 11 bp in Eschaneustyla sp. to 2,331 bp
in Holosticha sp., which contains 2 additional genes in this
region (Fig. 2; [6]). This motif was not present elsewhere
on either strand of the macronuclear pol α sequences, and
a search for this sequence in subtelomeric regions of 1,356
end-sequenced macronuclear chromosomes of S. histriomuscorum [9] also failed to identify more chromosomes
carrying this sequence (Cavalcanti and Chang, unpublished results). We detected no other significant motif by
aligning 5' non-coding leader sequences relative to the
TSS (Fig. 3a), the 9 bp motif (Fig. 3b), the ends of 5' telomeric sequences (Fig. 3c), or the putative AUG start
codons (Fig. 3d).

Figure 2of DNA polymerase α (pol α) genes from nine spirotrichous ciliates
Features
Features of DNA polymerase α (pol α) genes from nine spirotrichous ciliates. A schematic macronuclear DNA pol
α gene is shown in the inset. This is flanked by telomeres. The inset also shows the consensus sequence of the 5' conserved
motif (AATACCGCC), the transcription start site (right arrow), the putative translation start site (ATG), introns (3 found in
seven stichotrichous ciliates as small grey boxes and 2 in Euplotes spp. as small hatched boxes), the putative translation termination codon (STOP), the putative polyadenylation signal sequence (poly(A)), and the mRNA polyadenylation site (solid black diamond). Although relative positions of these features are shown, they are not drawn to scale. Italicized numbers indicate intron
lengths; allelic differences, when detected, are separated by "/". Numbers in the last column indicate the putative lengths
(number of amino acids) of DNA pol α proteins from each species. Other numbers represent the distances from one motif to
the next motif. For example, numbers in the first column represent distances from the 5' telomere to the 5' conserved motif.
The symbol "#" indicates that data were not available due to the unavailability of RNA, while a dashed line ("-") indicates that
the feature was not detected. Nucleotides in the 5' conserved motifs are shown as dots if they are identical to the consensus
AATACCGCC. For each species, only nucleotides that differ from this consensus sequence are shown, as well as nucleotides
that comprise the putative polyadenylation signal. A phylogenetic tree [18] is provided at the left of the figure for reference.
The lengths of the DNA pol α proteins, inferred from the
nine orthologs studied, vary from 1,403 aa in E. octocarinatus to 1,524 aa in S. lemnae (Fig. 2). However, the seven
conserved domains (I-VII) that characterize replicative
DNA polymerases [24,25] and five domains (A-E) identified in eukaryotic alpha-polymerases [26] are all present
in all nine genes described in this study. We note that a
second, in-frame stop codon, a conserved feature in the 3'
nontranslated region of 21 actin I genes in spirotrichs
[18], was only present in the DNA pol α gene of E. aediculatus. Tandem stop codons appear to be under selection in
yeast genomes to prevent read-through by a near-cognate
tRNA [27].

mRNAs contain the classic AAUAAA. Single nucleotide
variant AUUAAA and other potential sequences, including UAUAAA, AACAAA, UUUAAA, AAUAAG, AUUGAA,
GUUAAA, ACUAAA and others, may serve as alternate
poly(A) addition signals [33]. At least one of these putative signals is present in each of the DNA pol α mRNA
sequences, within the last 50 bp upstream of the poly(A)
site (Fig. 2). Another cis-element, a GU-rich or U-rich element downstream of poly(A) sites, has been shown to
help guide the cleavage of pre-mRNA at the 3' end before
poly(A) tail addition [34], and this element was also
found in all seven mRNA sequences in this study (data not
shown).

The mRNA polyadenylation (poly(A)) sites of all seven
DNA pol α genes were found at an adenine residue preceded by a thymine base, except in E. octocarinatus where
a cytosine base proceeded the adenine (data not shown).
Several previous studies have shown that the eukaryotic
poly(A) addition signal AAUAAA [28] is not universally
present within 50 bp upstream of the poly(A) sites
[8,11,12,18]. Similarly, in our study, only two out of the
seven DNA pol α mRNA sequences contain an AAUAAA
sequence (Fig. 2). However, recent studies of human [2932], mouse [32,33], and mammalian [29] expressed
sequence tag databases revealed that fewer than 66% of

Translation Initiation Sites and Introns
The translation initiation sites of spirotrich DNA pol α
genes have been the subject of some controversy [35].
Ribosomal frameshifting, which has been demonstrated
in Euplotes (for review, see [36]), or suppressed nonsense
mutations have been proposed to repair the 5' end of the
reading frame, which contains an in-frame stop codon
near the previously assigned translation initiation sites in
S. lemnae [35], S. histriomuscorum, and S. nova [37,38].
However, bioinformatic analyses suggested that two previously undetected 5' introns might provide a simple
alternative explanation instead. The evidence for short

introns came from analysis of patterns of synonymous
and nonsynonymous polymorphism [22] and divergence
among published macronuclear DNA sequence data
(including preliminary data reported in this study) in all
three possible reading frames, since the three exons occur
in different reading frames. cDNA sequencing confirmed
the presence of these introns. There are two phase zero
introns flanking the region encoding conserved domain A
in five stichotrichs: Holosticha sp., Uroleptus sp., P. weissei, S.
lemnae and S. histriomuscorum. While intron length varies
among these five species (Fig. 2), intron position is conserved in the protein alignment, with the first intron
found at QYQ|V(D/E)E and the second at KLD|PNE (data
not shown). With the exception of a hepta-nucleotide
sequence TGCGGTA found in the first intron in Holosticha, Uroleptus and Paraurostyla, there is no significant
sequence resemblance among "homologous" introns,
despite the A-T richness of the intron sequences (65–
88%). Through DNA sequence analysis, we infer the presence of the first intron in Eschaneustyla sp., but not the second intron. There is also no indication that either of these
two introns is present in the early diverged stichotrich U.
grandis.
We found only one intron in the 5' ends of DNA pol α
orthologs in E. aediculatus and E. octocarinatus. The position of these introns in the protein alignment is 10 nt (or
3.33 aa) downstream from the position of the first 5'
intron found in the other six stichotrichs (data not
shown). Moreover, the intron is 159 bp in E. aediculatus
and 1,271 bp long in E. octocarinatus (Fig. 2). To our
knowledge, 1,271 bp is the longest intron identified in
spirotrichous ciliates. We searched (blastn, blastx and
tblastx) [39] Genbank and found no significant match to
this long intron. It does not possess any detectable long
inverted repeats that are often associated with transposable elements in E. crassus [40,41], nor does it contain
ORFs longer than 70 aa. All introns in this study contain
the canonical GT...AG splicing signal, but not all contain
the putative extended splicing signal.
Upon removal of the intron sequences, we identified the
putative start codons in each of the DNA pol α genes, corresponding to the conserved ATG noted in [35], and we
also noted a conserved "MSD" at the very start of the translated protein. This motif is identical to the consensus
sequence derived from other eukaryotic orthologs
(KOG0970) [42], and we interpret this result as evidence
for the true initiation site in the ciliate proteins. There is
no indication of a programmed translational frameshift.
We identified one intron at the 3' end of the DNA pol α
gene in Uroleptus sp.. This intron is 33 bp with no in-frame
stop codon. We did not detect an intron at this position in
the ancestral species Holosticha, nor in the later diverged

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/6

Paraurostyla, Stylonychia or Sterkiella. However, the primary sequences of this gene in two other early diverged
species, U. grandis and Eschaneustyla sp., suggest the presence of a longer 3' intron at the same position (Fig. 2). We
also found one 3' intron in each of the two Euplotes
orthologs. However, the latter are 81 nt upstream of the
location of the 3' introns in three stichotrichs. It is therefore unlikely that the 3' introns in Euplotes and the three
stichotrichs descended from a common ancestor, since
this would require intron sliding.
Intron Genealogy Comparisons
We compared the intron positions in the nine spirotrich
orthologs and found evidence for independent intron
gain or loss in this collection of taxa. For example, the second 5' intron is present in five later diverged stichotrichs,
but absent from Urostyla, Eschaneustyla, and Euplotes (Fig.
2); the 3' intron in Euplotes is absent from seven stichotrichs; the 3' intron in Urostyla (Fig. 2), Eschaneustyla, and
Uroleptus is absent from the other six species (Fig. 2).
Notably, the DNA pol α gene contains three 5' introns in
the related alveolate Plasmodium falciparum [43] and two
in Toxoplasma gondii [44]. However, both of these apicomplexan DNA pol α proteins lack conserved domain A, precluding comparison of intron locations among all these
species based on amino acid alignment (Addis, unpublished results). The DNA pol α genes from these two apicomplexan parasites each contain one 3' intron, but their
locations are not conserved with each other, and both are
present further upstream than the 3' introns in this study
(Addis and Chang, unpublished results).
Statistical Significance of Direct Repeats Flanking Some
Introns
We noticed a tendency in our data for the presence of
direct repeats bridging exon-intron boundaries. Short
sequence repeats from four to eight nucleotides tend to
overlap with or lie near intron donor and acceptor splice
sites in six of the 14 introns we characterized (Table
2)[23]. The longer of these intron-flanking direct repeats
resemble the sequence structure of internal eliminated
sequences (IESs) that interrupt genes in the germline DNA
and are excised during macronuclear development in ciliates. Conventional IESs are always bound by pairs of
direct repeats, or pointer sequences, which are thought to
guide proper assembly of macronuclear-destined segments [1]. Moreover, both introns and IESs are A-T rich.
This resemblance raises the possibility that some introns
flanked by direct repeats could be removed at the DNA
level as IESs or vice versa, that some IESs could be removed
at the RNA level as introns. Not all introns or species had
intron-flanking repeats longer than 2 bp. However, for the
purposes of statistical analysis we report in Table 2 the
longest repeat that we could find in a 5 bp radius about
intron-exon boundaries. In Table 2, we note that all of the

three) are biologically significant in the sense that they
would preserve reading frame and not introduce stop
codons if they were spliced out as IESs. Furthermore, the
longer repeat pairs were generally unique in the macronuclear sequence and spanned only one macronuclear-destined segment (Table 2).
The question arises as to how likely such repeats would
occur by chance, given the other constraints that influence
these genes. The relevant constraints that we considered
were protein function, codon usage bias, and intron splicing. For repeats of length four or greater, we generated random exonic sequences by permuting codons among
synonymous sites, holding the translated amino acid
sequence fixed. We combined these with randomized
introns generated by permuting bases within each intron.
We considered three different levels of constraint from
intron splicing on donor and acceptor sites: no constraint;
canonical eukaryotic, which held the first and last two
bases of the introns fixed; and ciliate, which held the first
five and the last three bases of the introns fixed. We refer
to these as null models for calculating the probability of
repeats. For smaller repeats we computed the expected frequencies according to these null models exactly (see
methods).
All of the introns in our dataset contained canonical
eukaryotic splice signals 5'-GT...AG-3' but they did not
consistently contain the putative extended spirotrich ciliate splice signals 5'-GTAAG...TAG-3' referred to in [20,21].
Half of the introns in our dataset deviated from this
extended consensus at one or more nucleotides and every
site besides the first and last two bases was variable in at
least one of the the 14 introns. Therefore, because we

null model we considered is the canonical eukaryotic one.
Our null models make the following assumptions: fixed
amino acid sequences of the DNA pol α proteins in each
species; fixed codon usage bias in the genes of each species
with independent evolution of codons; and fixed base
composition of each intron independently with independent evolution of bases and possible splicing constraints.
We then measured in the null models for each of the 14
introns how often we observed exact repeats of any word
as long as or longer than the naturally observed repeats at
the exact same positions bridging the exon/intron boundaries. The relevant results are shown in Table 3, where in
each column, a False Discovery Rate (FDR) [45] is
reported for the multiple comparisons across introns.
Table 3 shows that repeats flanking the first and second
introns in Holosticha and the first introns in Uroleptus and
Urostyla are significantly rare in the eukaryotic splicing
constraint null model with a false discovery rate of 10%.
This implies that if the repeats flanking these four introns
were to be investigated further, the expected risk is less
than or equal to 10% that one of them is just a random
occurrence as represented in this null model. In contrast,
the eukaryotic splicing constraint null model could not be
rejected for the generally shorter repeats flanking the other
10 introns with this FDR. Although the first three introns
in Table 3 are homologous to each other, as are the last
two introns, the Benjamini and Hochberg procedure is
conservative when there is a positive dependency among
tests [46].

|| The values in italics were calculated exactly, multiplied by 105 and rounded; other values in upright face were calculated from permutation tests (N
= 100,000).

As mentioned, we also calculated the frequencies of
repeats in different null models of intron splicing constraints, one with no splicing constraints, and the other
with extended splicing constraints. Even with extended
"Ciliate" splicing constraints, the expected false discovery
rate rejecting the null model for the same four introns is
bounded by 25% (FDR ≤ 0.25). In fact, because of the evidence for this extended signal in our data and elsewhere
[20,21], the true result is likely to be bracketed by those
for the eukaryotic and ciliate extended models.
In all three null models we examined, the first Uroleptus
intron was more likely to be flanked by repeats than the
first Holosticha intron. The reason for this is that the Holosticha repeat contains a C, which is relatively rare in AT-rich
ciliate genes, where Uroleptus presents a T. The fact that
this substitution is mirrored in both repeat copies is consistent with their function in putative IES removal. Curiously, the TGTA repeats in the second Holosticha intron
were significant in the eukaryotic model, despite a length
of only four nucleotides. The reason for this is that the
intron in question contains only one G, other than that of
the intron splice acceptor. In fact, as discussed above and
shown in Table 2, this repeat pair would not preserve
frame if used in IES excision, nor does it lie within a single
macronuclear destined segment. Therefore we do not consider it likely to function in IES removal.

We extended our results by looking for occurrences of the
same repeat pair in the actual sequence data within 15 bp
windows surrounding the intron/exon boundaries. We
learned that these repeats occur only if they overlap the
intron/exon boundaries in our randomized sequences,
and almost always at exactly the same locations as in the
actual sequences. As such, the simulated repeats were
always frame-preserving when the natural repeats were
frame-preserving. In searching for any repeat pair as long
as or longer than those observed in the natural data, we
found such repeat pairs of any sequence to to be enormously common. Only the 8-bp Urostyla 3' intron repeats
were still significant by these criteria (data not shown).
However, all other repeats we studied, besides this one,
fall tightly over the intron-exon boundaries, making the
15 bp window not applicable.
It is interesting to ask under what conditions repeat
sequences in protein-coding regions can function dually
either in IES removal or intron splicing, while preserving
reading frame in both pathways. Considering only the
generic eukaryotic splice signals GT and AG (since AT-AC
introns have not been identified in ciliates), all possible
variations are shown in Table 1, along with the conditions
for such repeats to be frame-preserving. Pointer sequences
containing the word AGT are never frame-preserving. The
other two possibilities, words containing AG followed by
GT, and words containing GT followed by AG, place dif-

ferent requirements on the length of the intervening
sequence to be frame-preserving, as shown in Table 1.

Discussion
The macronucleus of spirotrichous ciliates contains more
than 20,000 short, linear DNA molecules flanked by C4A4
telomeric sequences (reviewed in [2]). These linear molecules form during macronuclear development by removing both inter- and intragenic spacer sequences from
germline micronuclear DNA and then stitching gene fragments together. As a result, they contain mostly coding
sequences with short flanking regions at both 5' and 3'
ends [8,9]. Each macronuclear molecule is also present in
multiple copies, ranging from 103 to 106 copies [2,47,48].
The advantage or disadvantage of this unorthodox genetic
system is unclear. In addition, little is known about the
molecular mechanisms that produce and regulate this system.
While the regulation of gene expression in spirotrichous
ciliates is poorly understood, and cis-elements, such as
promoter sequence(s), transcription factor binding sites,
and poly(A) signal(s) have been difficult to find
[8,11,12], most genes in spirotrichs have a consistent transcription start site (TSS) and poly(A) site [6,11]. Bender
and colleagues replaced the α-telomere binding protein
(α-TBP) gene in E. crassus with a gene for neomycin resistance and showed that this recombinant gene had the
same TSS as the wide type α-TBP gene [49]. Furthermore,
genes need to be precisely turned on and off during the ciliate life cycle, which suggests the existence of cis-elements
to guide and regulate gene expression.
In this study, we compared gene sequences for DNA
polymerase α from nine spirotrichous ciliates. We also
sequenced RNA versions of seven of these orthologs and
determined the mRNA 5' and 3' ends. We identified a
motif of aaTACCGCB present 5 – 34 nt upstream from the
TSS. This motif may serve one or more of the following
functions: (i) promoter; (ii) copy number regulation, (iii)
transcriptional regulator, (iv) chromosomal breakage signal. However, because this motif is absent from most
other sequenced macronuclear chromosomes (Cavalcanti
and Chang, unpublished results), it is unlikely to be a
chromosomal breakage signal. Furthermore, the previously identified chromosomal breakage signals HATTGAAaHH in euplotids [17,50] and TGAA in S. lemnae
[15,16] have no similarity to aaTACCGCB. While we have
no evidence to support or reject any of the other three
hypotheses, this motif is an excellent target for future
functional studies of macronuclear gene regulation.
Several attempts to identify the poly(A) signal located at
the 3' ends of macronuclear chromosomes have been
reported [8,11,12]. Perfect matches to the eukaryotic

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/6

poly(A) signal AAUAAA are not consistently found
upstream of the poly(A) sites. However, as many as 40%
of mammalian cDNA ends do not contain the AAUAAA
signal [29-33] and several single-nucleotide variants of
AAUAAA have been proposed as alternative poly(A) signals [33]. We searched for such sequences and found
examples 10 – 15 bp upstream from poly(A) sites in the
DNA pol α genes in six spirotrichs (vs. 32 bp upstream in
Uroleptus) (Fig. 2). In addition, the candidate poly(A)
motif (A/T)TAAAA derived from 27 Euplotes cDNA
sequences [11] and the putative poly(A) motif TAAAC in
S. lemnae [51] resemble the mammalian alternate signals.
These observations suggest that a poly(A) signal is present
at the 3' ends of most spirotrichous genes.
At 1,271 nt, the 5' intron in the DNA pol α gene in E. octocarinatus is approximately five times longer than the longest intron that has been previously reported in
spirotrichous ciliates. In addition to the intron paucity in
spirotrichs observed by Prescott [2], the spliceosomal
introns identified in spirotrichs and in Paramecium [52]
are generally shorter than 200 bp (for review, see [2]).
While most research has focused on asking why introns in
ciliates are short and how they are efficiently removed
[53,54], the limitation on intron size raises the question
of why long introns are rare in ciliates? A historical explanation could be that short introns were prevalent before
ciliates diverged from other eukaryotes. Alternatively,
there may be selective constraints that favor short introns
in ciliates. We tested whether the long intron in E. octocarinatus derived from a transposon, a pathway that has been
suggested by Rautmann et al. [55]. However, we detected
no long inverted repeats [40,41] nor any putative ORFs
that could partially encode a transposase [56]. Thus, the
presence of this exceptionally long intron poses a small
mystery.
We also noticed a quirky tendency of some introns in this
study to be flanked by direct repeats, reminiscent of the
pairs of pointer repeats that flank IESs and may facilitate
their removal. In some cases the observed repeats flanking
introns overlap intron donor and acceptor splice signals.
Five repeats we found of length five or greater were biologically significant, in that they would preserve protein-coding information if they were to function in IES removal,
and they also satisfy other criteria such as rarity in the
sequence and linear contiguity in a single macronucleardestined segment (Table 2). Furthermore, three pairs of
the five biologically significant repeats were also statistically significant by the permutation criteria and tests we
used to examine this question. The superficially "negative" result that arbitrary repeats are highly abundant in
randomized ciliate genes raises the question of how the
cell distinguishes those direct repeats that function as
pointers in IES removal from those that occur randomly,

and continually arise in evolution. The use of incorrect
pointers in IES excision would likely lead to premature
truncation of protein-coding sequences. Our results certainly suggest that further experimental pursuit of intron/
IES dual function could be fruitful.
It is tempting to speculate that some ciliate introns may
evolve into IESs by providing a nucleus for the evolution
of extended repeats, which then lead to the elimination of
the enclosed sequence during macronuclear development. This could help explain the observed intron paucity
and some intron loss in spirotrichs during evolutionary
time, as well as the shared locations of some introns and
IESs [23,57]. Table 1 defines the sequence length requirements under which, within a protein-coding sequence,
pointers that flank a nonscrambled IES might function
equivalently in intron splicing without disrupting frame.
This table may provide a useful way to study pointer
sequences (in nonscrambled repeats) with possible or historical dual function. A further implication of our findings
is that the proposed dual roles for such sequence repeats
offers the possibility for surveillance of failures in IES
removal. Examples of such a failure have been described
in [22,58] and (Mollenbeck et al., unpublished). We speculate that the opportunity for surveillance and correction
of errors could drive an advantage of dual function in
either direction: If intron splicing were error-prone, then
such circumstances could favor conversion of introns to
IESs. Conversely, surveillance of faulty IES excision via
sloppy intron removal would confer an advantage to the
organism as well, by providing a second chance to restore
reading frame.

Conclusion
Our results suggest that conserved motifs, perhaps participating in gene regulation, are present in both 5' and 3'
untranscribed regions of the DNA pol α genes. Our data
also suggest that several independent gains and losses of
introns in DNA pol α genes have occurred in the spirotrichous ciliate lineage. Finally, we found statistical and bioinformatic support for the hypothesis that direct repeats
flanking introns might have an additional function in IES
removal. This may favor the scenario in which introns
evolve into IESs, which would explain the observed ciliate
intron scarcity. Alternatively, some IESs might actually be
spliced as introns, as a back-up in case they fail to be
removed during macronuclear development. Further
experimental pursuit of both hypotheses would be fruitful, noting that the two scenarios are not mutually exclusive and that both may contribute to the evolvability and
robustness of information in ciliate genomes.

Methods
Cell Culture and DNA Isolation
Euplotes aediculatus, Eschaneustyla sp., Holosticha sp. [6],
Uroleptus sp. [23], and Paraurostyla weissei [23] were isolated from lakes and soils in Princeton area and characterized by morphologies to the genus level. Stylonychia
lemnae strain Y and Euplotes octocarinatus were generous
gifts from Dr. Hans Lipps. Sterkiella histriomuscorum strain
JRB310 was a generous gift from Dr. Glenn Herrick. DNA
of U. grandis was a generous gift from Dr. David Prescott.
Ciliate species were grown in conditions published elsewhere [6]. Macronuclei and micronuclei were separated
before subsequent DNA extraction following established
protocols [6].
Macronuclear DNA Polymerase α Genes
Parts of the macronuclear DNA polymerase α (pol α)
genes were first PCR amplified by using degenerate primer
sets published elsewhere [35,37]. The PCR products were
cloned, sequenced, and the newly obtained sequences
were used to design specific primers and PCR amplify to
5' or 3' ends of genes following our established telomere
suppression PCR protocol [6,59,60]. Genbank accession
numbers for macronuclear DNA pol α genes are: U. grandis type I: AY008387; U. grandistype II: AY008386[23];
Holosticha sp.: AY293851[6]; Uroleptus sp.: AY293852; P.
weissei: AY293806[23]; E. aediculatus: DQ060373; E. octocarinatus: DQ060372; Eschaneustyla sp.: DQ060374; S.
lemnae: AF194338[35]; S. histriomuscorum: U59426[37].
Genbank accession numbers for other eukaryotic DNA
pol α genes are: Plasmodium falciparum (PFD0590c); Toxoplasm gondii (AF093136).
RNA Isolation and Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends
Ciliate cells were fed with green algae one day prior to harvesting for RNA isolation. Cells were then concentrated by
filtering through 10 μM sieve (Sefar American). RNA was
extracted by using the Trizol LS reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. The quantity and
purity of RNA were assessed by measuring UV absorbance
at 260 nm/280 nm. 5'- and 3'- rapid amplification of
cDNA ends (RACE) were carried out by using the FirstChoice RLM-RACE kit (Ambion) following manufacturers'
protocols.
Sequence Analyses
The alignments of DNA poly α genes were generated by
using Accelrys (formerly GCG) software package.
Sequence management under Windows OS was assisted
by using the software Bioedit [61]. The 9 bp motif and
direct repeats flanking introns were identified by inspection of the sequence alignment. We investigated the ability of each repeat pair to preserve reading frame after
potential excision of their enclosed region as an IES. The
alignment was trimmed and separated into exon and

Biology Direct 2007, 2:6

intron portions in Seaview [62]. DNA conserved motifs
were calculated at [63].
Permutations and Statistical Tests
Programs were written in Perl to generate permutations of
the six sequences with observed intron-flanking repeats of
length four or greater according to different constraints
and to thereby test, by a randomization procedure, the
statistical significance of the occurrence of repeats surrounding introns. Sequence manipulation was done in
BioPerl [64]. Permutations were generated with the
Fisher-Yates
algorithm
implemented
in
Algorithm::Numerical::Shuffle [65]. For each intron and exon
of interest, sets of 10,000 or 100,000 random permutations were generated for statistical tests.

Codons were permuted within and among exons, preserving the amino acid sequence of the protein (using the
UAR:Gln genetic code) and the codon usage of the gene.
Bases were permuted within each intron either freely or
fixing bases inside splice junctions, so as to preserve their
lengths, base compositions, and potential splicing constraints.
For each repeat pair, permuted exons and introns were
combined to generate simulated genes in which the occurrence of repeats was monitored.
For other species and introns with shorter repeats, the
equivalent probabilities of repeats in our null models
were computed exactly by hand from the probabilities of
sampling words without replacement from multinomial
distributions based on intron compositions and the
codon frequencies of exons.
Definition and Calculation of "Frame-Preservation" of
Repeats Flanking Introns
Let φIntron be the phase on removal of an intron and φIES be
the phase after IES excision from repeats that flank such
an intron in such a way that this IES excision potentially
disrupts the splicing of that intron (a disrupting pair). We
say that the repeats are frame-preserving if φIntron = φIES. Let
the 5' and 3' coordinates of the intron be (i, j), the 5' coordinates of a disrupting pair of repeats be A and C, and the
5' coordinates of a differently located disrupting pair of
repeats be a and c. We then have φIntron = (j - i + 1)mod3,
and φIES = (C - A + 1)mod3 or φIES = (c - a + 1)mod3. If the
first pair of repeats are frame-preserving then (j - i +
1)mod3 = (C - A + 1)mod3, similarly for the second pair
of repeats. The quality of frame-preservation is transitive;
if both pairs of repeats are frame-preserving, then we
know that (c - a + 1)mod3 = (C - A + 1)mod3. Since both
(c - a + 1) and (C - A + 1) are congruent modulo 3, we
know by definition that (c - a - C + A)mod3 = 0. We used
this last relation to test whether permuted repeats were

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/6

frame preserving given that natural repeats are frame-preserving, without knowing the length or coordinates of the
introns.

Reviewers' comments
Reviewer's report 1
Alexei Fedorov, Department of Medicine, Medical University of Ohio (nominated by Manyuan Long)

This paper represents very interesting results and hypothesis, so I have no reservation in recommending it for publication. However, many places in this MS are not readerfriendly. I suggest a revision in the style of presentation
(Minor revision prior to publication). In a nutshell, only
a very small group of scientists have a good expertise in
ciliates. Thus, a good brief introduction to the problem is
desirable for a broader audience....
Author response: We have now reordered and rewritten the
background section for clarity and added a new figure (Fig. 1)
to help a general reader understand the problem.
On the other hand, when the authors start describing the
introns on page 8, they present half a page of irrelevant
discussion about suppression of non-sense mutations etc.
I think that it is a nice piece for a lecture on this material.
However, I was already overwhelmed by a number of specific details on the previous pages.
Author response: We have shortened this section by simply
presenting questions/hypotheses to be solved, followed by results.
At the same time, since not many people know about ciliates' introns, it would be desirable to describe their general features. Do they have canonical GT.. ..AG termini? Is
their splicing junction consensus similar to other species?

Page 11 of 15
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2007, 2:6

Author response: So far all spirotrich introns are found to
have canonical GT...AG termini, while extended signals for this
group have also been proposed of GTAAG...TAG. We have
included this information in the background and results sections.
In addition, there is much room for improvement of the
figures, in order to make them self-explanatory. Currently,
a reader would need to spend some time in order to
understand them.
Author response: The new figure 1 should be illustrative to a
general audience and helpful toward understanding figure 2.

Reviewer's report 2
John M. Logsdon, Jr., Department of Biological Sciences,
University of Iowa

Macronuclear copies of the DNA polymerase alpha gene
from nine phylogenetically-diverse spirotrich ciliates have
been analyzed here, including two new sequences for this
study. The authors analyzed RNA transcripts from seven
of these species in order to better understand cis-regulatory signals, and in doing so the authors have identified
some spliceosomal introns in these genes. The manuscript
details the analysis of conserved motifs, intron postions
and statistical tests to evaluate the relationship between
introns and internal eliminated sequences (IESs).
In a very straightforward manner, the results indicate
some clear sequence motifs that are likely involved in
transcription of these genes. This is a valuable contribution to the field since such signals are not well understood
in these organisms. These ciliates are also somewhat depauperate of spliceosomal introns, making the authors' discovery of 2 or 3 introns per gene of some interest on its
own. The presence of spliceosomal introns was verfied by
cDNAs in most cases and reveals five separate sites that
harbor introns. The two Euplotes species both have two
introns (at shared positions) that are not shared in position with the introns in the other species. The three
remaining introns are variably present among the other
seven species: two are widely present (6/7 and 5/7), and
one less widely (3/7). At face value, these data indicate
that introns are being gained and/or lost in this lineage.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/6

novel hypothesis for intron loss, but it does not seem to
explain many of their own observations. It is only the last
(most 3') intron that requires an inference of loss in this
dataset: this intron is present in Urostyla grandis,
Eschaneustyla sp., and Uroleptus sp., and missing in all of
the other taxa shown. Notably, this intron is missing in
Holostricha sp., and in the P. weissei/Sty. lemnae/Ste. histrio. clade which, given the phylogeny, would indicate its
separate loss in these two lineages. The other four introns
can be parsimoniously explained by single gains with no
losses.
Considering the putative intron losses from the Holostricha sp., and P. weissei/Sty. lemnae/Ste. histrio. clades,
there is available data from some of these species on the
micronuclear arrangement of this gene (PNAS 102:
15149). In these species, is there an IES in the same location as the "lost" intron? How about the other intron positions? In general, it might be useful to provide a "map" of
the IESs relative to the intron positions.
Author response: In the PNAS paper we did provide a map of
IES locations (where pointers are) relative to intron positions.
In some cases IESs coincide precisely with putative intron loss
positions, e.g. an IES in P. weissei is present at the same position of the 3' intron in Uroleptus; numerous IESs surround the
5' intron regions in U. grandis.
Also, the authors do not consider the converse idea: that
some intron gain could be explained by the coincidence
between splicing signals and IESs. That is, some unremoved IESs could function as spliceosomal introns.
Author response: Although we had included this alternative
interpretation in the conclusion, as it fits with our earlier work
on the subject (Ardell et al. 2003), it was not expressed clearly
enough in the version you reviewed. We agree with the reviewer
about the importance of this alternative hypothesis and have
now stated it more clearly throughout the paper.
Although the authors argue that one of these introns (the
first one) is shared between ciliates and animals (H.sapiens and C.elegans), the data presented are unconvincing.
The alignment segment shown (Fig 3A) does not allow a
clear assessment of homology of the residues involved.
For example, the following alternative alignment in which
a gap is shifted, seems possible:

In considering a possible mechanistic relationship
between spliceosomal introns and IESs, the authors evaluate some potentially shared signals between these processes. These statistical analyses suggest that introns
flanked with direct repeats (as sometimes occurs with
splicing signals) could be lost via IES excision (at the DNA
level). The results are consistent with this interesting and

eliminated during the development of the macronucleus,
in which parts of the DNA are removed. This resemblance
raises the possibility that the machinery that eliminates
these DNA sequences operates also on introns or vice
versa.

INTRON

ABOVE

The apparent gap in the C. elegans sequence casts doubt
on the alignment (and homology assessment) of the
intron-containing sites in animals. If the introns are not
shared between animals, then there is very little reason to
consider this position as "ancient" or even old. Thus, the
apparently coincident position in the ciliate and human
gene (which looks to be valid, given the alignment) would
more easily be explained as separate gains into that site. In
order to make a stronger case for the antiquity of this (or
any other) intron, a much more phylogenetically broad
survey of the available gene sequences and their introns
will need to be performed and presented. If so, a more
extensive alignment of the amino-acid sequences would
be needed to assess the homology inferences at each of the
intron-containing sites.

I have had some comments in an earlier version of this
manuscript, but those have all been dealt with. Certainly
in perspective of the enormous species diversity of ciliates
and in perspective of their genome size (some contain
more than 30.000 genes) there is relatively little known
about these species with their peculiar genome organization. That their IES machinery is somehow related to their
splicing machinery opens new possibilities for research.
Having said that, the statistical support for the "non"-randomness of the direct repeats that the authors observe
flanking the introns is rather weak. Furthermore not all
the introns are flanked by repeats. The authors first identify the repeats and then test their significance. Nevertheless, the hypothesis is tantalizing and I do hope the
authors will be able to find more support for it in future
studies.
Author response: We thank Dr. Huynen for his prompt
response and his suggestion. As stated above, we would conduct
a more extensive research with other genes.

Acknowledgements
As for the other introns that are nearby known positions
in orthologs from other species (as in Figure 3B), there is
simply no good reason to consider these introns as
homologous. There is very little (if any) support for the
idea of "intron-sliding" as a mechanism to explain discordant positions. Instead, separate intron gain at nearby
sites provides a better explanation for these data.

We thank Catherine A. Lozupone, Ed Curtis for sharing unpublished data;

The paper by Chang et al analyzes the DNA pol alpha
genes in a number of spirotrichous ciliates. By comparing
mRNA and DNA sequences the authors map the introns
for these genes. Furthermore they examine their single
gene chromosomes for the presence sequence motifs.
Most interesting is the observation that they observe a preponderance of direct repeats spanning the exon-intron
boundaries. Some of these resemble sequences that are
