Abstract
Background: ATP binding cassette (ABC) systems are responsible for the import and export of
a wide variety of molecules across cell membranes and comprise one of largest protein
superfamilies found in prokarya, eukarya and archea. ABC systems play important roles in bacterial
lifestyle, virulence and survival. In this study, an inventory of the ABC systems of Burkholderia
pseudomallei strain K96243 and Burkholderia mallei strain ATCC 23344 has been compiled using
bioinformatic techniques.
Results: The ABC systems in the genomes of B. pseudomallei and B. mallei have been reannotated
and subsequently compared. Differences in the number and types of encoded ABC systems in
belonging to these organisms have been identified. For example, ABC systems involved in iron
acquisition appear to be correlated with differences in genome size and lifestyles between these
two closely related organisms.
Conclusion: The availability of complete inventories of the ABC systems in B. pseudomallei and B.
mallei has enabled a more detailed comparison of the encoded proteins in this family. This has
resulted in the identification of ABC systems which may play key roles in the different lifestyles and
pathogenic properties of these two bacteria. This information has the potential to be exploited for
improved clinical identification of these organisms as well as in the development of new vaccines
and therapeutics targeted against the diseases caused by these organisms.

Background
The Burkholderia are non spore-forming, Gram-negative
bacteria. Burkholderia pseudomallei is a saprophytic bacillus
and the causative agent of the emerging infection melioidosis, an endemic disease in southeast Asia and Northern
Australia [1].Burkholderia mallei is an obligate pathogen of

solipeds and can infect humans although cases are rare
[2]. It is the causative agent of glanders, a disease that is
endemic in areas of Asia, the Middle East, Northern Africa
and the Mediterranean [3]. Both B. mallei and B. pseudomallei have been classified as category B threat agents by
the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

The reporting of the sequenced genomes of both B. pseudomallei strain K96243 [4] and B. mallei strain ATCC
23344 [5] has revealed that these bacteria are closely
related. Multilocus sequence-based typing has shown that
B. mallei is a clonal derivative of B. pseudomallei [6],
although significant differences exist between the
genomes of these organisms [4,5]. The B. pseudomallei
K96243 genome is 1.31 Mb larger than that of B. mallei
ATCC 23344 and 16% of chromosome 1 and 31% of
chromosome 2 of B. pseudomallei K96243 is unique with
respect to B. mallei ATCC 23344. In contrast, < 1% of chromosome 1 and only 4% of chromosome 2 of B. mallei
ATCC 23344 is unique with respect to B. pseudomallei
K96243. The acquisition of DNA is a feature of the
genome of B. pseudomallei K96243 [5], whilst the reduced
size of the B. mallei ATCC 23344 genome appears to be
related to a process of reductive evolution [4]. The difference in genome sizes may be related to differences in lifestyle observed between these two organisms. Specifically,
the greater number of genes in B. pseudomallei may reflect
the ability of the organism to survive in soil and water as
well as in a diverse range of mammalian and avian hosts
whereas B. mallei survives mainly within soliped hosts
and not in the environment [3]. Furthermore, comparative genomic analyses indicate that B. mallei may lack gene
products and pathways essential for survival in the environment whereas both organisms share other functional
pathways associated with virulence or drug resistance
[5,4].
ATP-binding cassette (ABC) systems are versatile transport
systems which vary greatly in size and generally function
to import or export a range of substances [7]. In pathogenic bacteria these systems can play important roles in
survival and pathogenicity [7]. The common feature of all
ABC systems is the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP by the highly
conserved ABC [8]. The ABC has three conserved motifs,
known as the Walker A and B sites, commonly found in
ATPases, and the linker peptide which has the signature
motif LSSGQ. The majority of ABC systems contain two
hydrophilic cytoplasmic domains (ABC domains) in association with two hydrophobic membrane-spanning
domains (IM domains). Import systems are specific to
prokaryotic organisms and contain ABC and IM domains
on separate polypeptide chains along with an extracytoplasmic binding protein (BP) for proper function. In
Gram-negative bacteria the BPs are located in the periplasm whereas in Gram positive organisms, these proteins
are anchored to the cellular membrane by an N-terminal
acyl glyceryl cysteine. An important role for bacterial ABC
import systems is in the import of iron-siderophore complexes, free iron and other iron bound complexes. Bacterial ABC import systems function in the acquisition of free
iron, iron-bound complexes, mono-and oligosaccharides,
organic and inorganic ions, amino acids and short pep-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/83

tidesmetals and vitamins [9]. In contrast, ABC systems
involved in export are found in both prokaryotic and
eukaryotic organisms contain IM and ABC domains fused
in a variety of conformations. Most export systems are
expressed as with the IM domain fused to the ABC either
N-terminally (IM-ABC) or C-terminally (ABC-IM). These
polypeptides homodimerise to form a functional system.
A great number are predicted to have a role in drug resistance [9], although a number have other functions such as
in the secretion of siderophores [10]. Other ABC systems
with roles regulatory functions such as DNA repair [9] do
not contain IM domains and often are comprised of two
fused ABC domains (ABC2). ABC systems are also
involved in toxin export and include the well-characterized system for haemolysin export in Escherichia coli
[11,12]. Recently, ABC system components have been
identified as potential vaccine targets due their cellular
location in or near bacterial membrane and their potential presentation to the host immune system [13].
The aim of this study was to carry out a detailed comparison of the ABC systems of the genomic sequencing strains
B. pseudomallei strain K96243 and B. mallei strain ATCC
23344. Reconstruction of the annotation of the ABC systems using uniform classification was undertaken in order
to give a precise prediction of ABC system complements.
Data obtained has the potential to provide new insights
into the types of proteins used for the survival and pathogenesis of these two related but functionally distinct
organisms.

Results and Discussion
The original annotations of ABC systems in the genomes
of B. pseudomallei strain K96243 and B. mallei strain ATCC
23344 are somewhat imprecise since a uniform nomenclature for these proteins was not used and functional
assignment varied considerably. Here we describe the
results of the reannotation and a comparison of the ABC
systems of both organisms. New information about the
predicted function of ABC systems along with similarities
and differences between the organisms has been achieved
through the use of the ABCISSE database. This approach
has enabled an improvement in the identification and
assignment of components of specific ABC systems with
uniform annotation and classification. A significant
advantage of this work, compared to the existing annotations, is the prediction of how the individual ABC system
components combine to form functional systems. In particular, ABC system-associated proteins are included
which are not encoded within short operons, but rather
are shown to be part of a system on the basis of similarity
to proteins with known or predicted function in a specific
system type. A complete inventory of the ABC systems of
B. pseudomallei strain K96243 and B. mallei strain ATCC
23344 is included as an additional file.

The ABC systems of B. pseudomallei
An analysis of the 7.2 Mb genome of B. pseudomallei strain
K96243 revealed a total of 338 ABC system-associated
open reading frames (ORFs) organised into 105 predicted
functional ABC systems. Of these, 70 systems (66.6%) are
encoded on chromosome 1 and 35 systems (33.3 %) are
encoded on chromosome 2 (Figure 1). Chromosome 1 of
B. pseudomallei K96243 represents 56% of the genome and
contains a higher proportion of coding sequences (CDSs)
than chromosome 2. Chromosome 1 also contains a
higher proportion of CDSs predicted to be involved in
core metabolic functions, whilst chromosome 2 preferentially encodes proteins with accessory functions [5]. Based
upon the analysis undertaken here chromosome 1 of B.
pseudomallei K96243 is predicted to encode 25 systems
that belong to 19 different families (and subfamilies)
which are not encoded on chromosome 2. In contrast,
chromosome 2 encodes only two predicted systems that
do not belong to families already encoded on chromosome 1.

The ABC systems of B. pseudomallei K96243 were classified
according to the format described by Dassa and Bouige [9]
including three main classes. Fourteen systems were
ascribed to class 1 (Figure 1) which is characterised by an
ABC domain fused to an IM domain and contains systems
predicted to function in the export of substances from
cells. Nine systems with a duplicated, fused ABC were
found to belong to class 2, with predicted functions in
antibiotic resistance via an undetermined mechanism or
intracellular regulatory processes. However, the majority
of ABC systems of B. pseudomallei K96243 (82 systems)
were found to belong to class 3, predicted to function in
import processes. These class 3 ABC systems could then be
further subdivided. Sixty-one systems were predicted to be
binding protein-dependent importers of known function
and eleven systems were predicted to be importers but of
unknown function. The remaining ten systems, although
clustered phylogenetically in class 3, failed to show signature sequences indicative of known import functions.
The large number of systems encoded on the B. pseudomallei strain K96243 genome perhaps reflects the diverse
environment in which the organism can survive [14]. The
acquisition of genomic material, including additional
ABC systems, during the evolution of B. pseudomallei may
have enhanced the capacity of this organism to survive in
different environments and in a range of mammalian
hosts [4]. With the exception of one putative monosaccharide import system, disrupted by an apparent deletion
of the ABC, the genome of B. pseudomallei strain K96243
was predicted to encode all of the systems present in B.
mallei strain ATCC 23344 (see additional file 1). In addition, B. pseudomallei strain K96243 was found to have a
further 29 predicted systems which are either absent or

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/83

predicted to be inactive in B. mallei strain ATCC 23344
(see additional file 1). The analysis also indicated that
some ABC systems may share the same function. This
higher level of redundancy and larger number of ABC systems in B. pseudomallei compared to B. mallei ATCC 23344
may contribute to the ability of B. pseudomallei may contribute to survive in a range of environments and hosts.
The ABC systems of B. mallei
B. mallei strain ATCC 23344 has a genome size of 5.8 Mb
and is predicted to encode a total of 275 ABC component
proteins forming 77 different ABC systems. Of these, reannotation identified 54 systems (70%) encoded on chromosome 1 and 23 systems (30%) encoded on
chromosome 2 (Figure 2). The class distribution of ABC
systems in B. mallei ATCC 23344 was found to be similar
to that observed in B. pseudomallei K96243 described
above. Specfically, 11 ABC systems of B. mallei ATCC
23344 are predicted to belong to class 1, 9 systems belong
to class 2 and have ABC 2 arrangement, and a total of 57
systems are predicted to belong to class 3. The distribution
of class 3 systems was also similar to that identified in B.
pseudomallei strain K96243 with 39 predicted import systems of known function, 10 predicted import systems of
unknown function, and 8 systems classified phylogenetically as class 3 but without a predicted functional mechanism.

B. mallei strain ATCC 23344 was found to have lost some
or all of the apparent redundancy observed in B. pseudomallei K96243, especially for the uptake of polyamines,
monosaccharides and polar amino acids, demonstrated
by a reduced number of B. mallei ABC systems in the class
3 MOI, MOS and PAO families compared to B. pseudomallei (Figures 1 and 2). As stated above, B. pseudomallei
strain K96243 encodes 27 more ABC systems than to B.
mallei strain ATCC 23344 (see Table 1). Three of these
ABC systems are located in the genome islands specific to
B. pseudomallei strain K96243 [5] which suggest that they
have been acquired since this organism diverged from B.
mallei. Comparison of the reannotated ABC system inventories reveals that the B. mallei ATCC 23344 genome completely lacks 14 of the remaining 24 systems, whist
another 7 systems are predicted to be inactive due to the
deletion of a gene encoding one ABC component. Three
other systems appear to be inactive due to the presence of
a predicted pseudogene within the each system. Although
some of the lost systems in B. mallei may be redundant
due to the presence of other similar systems, the loss of
other functional systems in B. mallei results in the complete absence of systems of particular families or sub-families. For example, B. mallei has no ABC systems for the
uptake of pyochelin, polar amino acid, or alkylphosphonate (see additional file 1). Thus, it is possible that these

allocrites may not be required by B. mallei in its reduced
lifestyle compared to B. pseudomallei.
Reannotation and phylogenetic classification of the ABC
systems of B. mallei strain ATCC 23344 has enabled the
prediction of new functions involved in lipid A, haemolysin or ornibactin export, drug resistance, lipoprotein
release and the import of iron (III), oligopeptides, or
aliphatic sulphonates for ABC systems previously annotated without predicted functions. Genome reduction in
B. mallei compared to B. pseudomallei appears to have
resulted in the loss of metabolic properties essential for
environmental survival [3]. In this context, the reduction
in the number of ABC systems encoded by B. mallei
described here may reflect the organism's ability to survive
in its specialized environment within an animal host and
concomitantly its inability to survive in the environment.
ABC systems involved in virulence and drug resistance
Pore-forming toxins such as haemolysin have been previously identified as important virulence factors in a range
of pathogens including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Corynebacterium diphtheriae [15]. The genome
of B. pseudomallei strain K96243 was found to encode

three systems for the export of haemolysin from the cell as
a result of the new reannotation and classification. The
genome of B. mallei strain ATCC 23344 encodes orthologs
of two of these systems. Interestingly neither B. mallei nor
B. pseudomallei have demonstrated haemolytic activity and
no haemolysins associated with these organisms have
been characterized yet. Nevertheless, these results open
the possibility that these Burkholderia strains may produce
haemolysin-type macromolecules which, for example,
could be expressed during the infection process within the
host. Other macromolecules such as LPS and capsule
polysaccharides have also been suggested to act as virulence factors in both B. mallei [16,17] and B. pseudomallei
[18-20], offering protection against antibody- and complement-mediated immune responses. Orthologs of ABC
systems predicted to be involved in the export of capsular
polysaccharide and LPS have been identified through
reannotation as present in B. pseudomallei K96243 and B.
mallei ATCC 23344 (see additional file 1).
The reannotation described here has identified both B.
pseudomallei and B. mallei ABC systems with predicted
roles in resistance to MLS (macrolides, lincosamide and
streptogramin), polyketide (such as rifamycin) and pep-

tide antibiotics (such as colistins). It is known that B. pseudomallei is intrinsically resistant to most penicillins
(although not β-lactams), first and second generation
cephalosporins, macrolides, rifamycins, colistins and
aminoglycosides [21]. Similarly, B. mallei is also resistant
to these antibiotics, with the exception of aminoglycosides [22]. The mutants which disrupt function of the B.
pseudomallei Resistance-Nodulation-Cell Division (RND)
superfamily BpeAB-OprA [23] and Amr-OprA [24] efflux
systems have both been shown to increase the susceptibility of this organism to aminoglycosides. B. mallei lacks an
Amr-OprA system which likely contributes to its sensitivity to aminoglycosides Comparisons of the ABC system
inventories here also indicate that a B. pseudomallei ABC
system predicted to be involved in antibiotic resistance,
but with no predicted specificity, is mutated in B. mallei
strain ATCC 23344. This mutation may also contribute to
the difference in antibiotic sensitivities observed between
B. mallei and B. pseudomallei (see additional file 1).
ABC systems involved in the iron acquisition
The reannotation and comparison of the ABC systems of
B. pseudomallei strain K96243 and B. mallei strain ATCC
23344 reveals differences between the two organisms in
the number of ABC systems potentially involved in the

acquisition of iron.B. pseudomallei strain K96243 encodes
eight predicted ABC iron acquisition systems whereas
only four of these systems are present in B. mallei ATCC
strain 23344 (Table 2). Two of these orthologous systems
are predicted to be involved in the direct uptake of iron
(III) from the environment, and the two other systems are
predicted to be involved in iron acquisition using
siderophores. About 15 years ago B. pseudomallei was
shown to produce a siderophore, under iron-limiting
growth conditions, which was named malleobactin [25].
It was subsequently shown that malleobactin acquires
iron from transferrin and lactoferrin [26]. Recently,
malleobactin was reisolated and shown, by mass spectrometry, to actually be composed of three compounds
[27]. Though no chemical structures of these compounds
have been determined yet, two of these compounds show
characteristics similar to the ornibactins from Burkholderia
cenocepacia [27,28]. Specifically, both B. pseudomallei
K96243 and B. mallei ATCC 23344 have an ABC system
annotated for export of ornibactin, and another system
associated with the import of ornibactin (although annotated for the import of hemin, this system is predicted to
interact with one of a number of siderophore receptors
including the ornibactin receptor). A recent comparative
microarray study revealed that under iron-limited growth

conditions ABC systems predicted to be involved in the
export of ornibactin and in the uptake of iron-ornibactin
complexes are up regulated in both B. pseudomallei
K96243 and B. mallei ATCC 23344 [29]. However, four
ABC iron acquisition systems present in B. pseudomallei
strain K96243 do not appear to be functional in B. mallei
strain ATCC 23344. Two of these systems, predicted to
function in the direct uptake of iron (III) and hemin from
the environment, are disrupted by pseudogenes in B. mallei ATCC 23344. In addition, the import of iron bound to
the siderophore pyochelin is predicted to be non-functional as a result of an apparent deletion of the pyochelin
outer membrane receptor. Finally, an additional ABC system involved in the export of pyochelin to the extracellular environment is completely absent from the genome of
B. mallei ATCC strain 23344. Notably, a global transcriptional analysis of RNA extracted from B. pseudomallei
under iron-limiting conditions shows upregulation of a
pyochelin receptor, as well upregulation of a siderophore
receptor designated for the import of malleobactin [27]
(see also Table 2). Furthermore, comparative microarray
data also shows that in iron-limited growth conditions,
pyochelin export and import systems are upregulated in

B. pseudomallei K96243 but not in B. mallei [29]. The ability to scavenge iron is particularly important for the survival of intracellular pathogens due to the low levels
available in the host cell environment. For example, Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been demonstrated primarily to
survive within host macrophages and iron uptake through
siderophores is required for growth and virulence in the
macrophage [30]. Iron-dependent regulation of virulence
has also been described for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a close
relative of B. pseudomallei, and involves the expression of
siderophores during iron-limited conditions which upregulate the expression of other virulence factors, including
haemolysin [31,32]. In addition, iron overload conditions such as β-thalassaemia may predispose patients to
infection with Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium
and other intracellular pathogens [30]. It is known that
the ability of B. pseudomallei to successfully establish an
infection may be dependent on its ability to scavenge iron
[33]. Thus, the comparatively reduced ability of B. mallei
to scavenge iron using its ABC systems may correlate with
the different lifestyle of this organism and may impact
upon its virulence properties. A detailed investigation of
the iron acquisition capabilities of B. mallei ATCC 23344

and B. pseudomallei K96243 and the influence of the ABC
systems on virulence would enhance the understanding
on the differences between these two organisms.

Interestingly, this process of reductive evolution still
leaves B. mallei with a considerably higher number of ABC
systems (77 in total) compared to the average number of
45 for obligate extracellular bacteria [35].

Conclusion
In this study the ABC systems of B. pseudomallei strain
K96243 and B. mallei strain ATCC 23344 have been reannotated using the ABCISSE database in order to provide
new information and a uniform annotation and classification of ABC systems in these organisms. The complete set
of ABC systems in B. mallei and B. pseudomallei is now
incorporated into the ABCISSE database [34]. The new
annotation has enabled a more detailed comparison to be
made of the numbers and types of ABC systems present in
these pathogenic Burkholderia species. The greater number
and redundancy of ABC systems in B. pseudomallei, including those systems associated with iron acquisition, may be
indicative of ability of this organism to persist and replicate in a greater variety of environments when compared
to B. mallei. It is also worth noting that genomes of these
bacteria encode a large number of ABC systems when
compared to the predicted numbers of ABC systems in
other organisms [35].B. mallei is an obligate mammalian
pathogen and as such is predicted to require a smaller
number of ABC systems. B. mallei is a recent divergent
from B. pseudomallei [6] and is undergoing a process of
reductive evolution [5] resulting in a reduced genome, a
reduced the number of ABC systems and limited ability to
survive in a variety of niches compared to B. pseudomallei.

The differences in ABC systems identified here from comparison the genomes of B. pseudomallei strain K96243 and
B. mallei strain ATCC 23344 may also be exploited for the
development of new diagnostic or clinical reagents specific for each organism. For example, the addition of primers targeted to the different ABC systems of each organism
could add another layer of accuracy to the existing PCRbased tests which use type III secretion systems [36] or 23S
rDNA [37] for identification. Furthermore, since ABC systems have also been identified as candidates for vaccine
development [13], the selection of outer membrane ABC
components from B. pseudomallei and B. mallei may represent good targets for the development of new vaccines
designed to provide protection against melioidosis or
glanders.

Methods
ABC systems in B. pseudomallei K96243 or B. mallei ATCC
23344 were identified on the basis of sequence homologies to proteins of ABC systems in other bacterial species.
Proteins were classified according to their predicted roles
as ABC system components. The complete CDSs (ORFs
likely to encode proteins) of B. pseudomallei K96243[5]or
B. mallei ATCC 23344[4] were used to query the ABCISSE

v3.2 database [34] which includes ABC protein classification and predicted function based on similarity to proteins with experimentally derived function. The query was
performed by using BLASTP [38], with a threshold e-value
of 10-6. A hit from this search was predicted to belong to
a given family (or subfamily) and to transport a specific
allocrite if the top ten hits belonged to the family (or subfamily) and were predicted to transport a specific allocrite.
An ABC system was defined as a series of contiguous ORFs
that shared the same family, subfamily and substrate.
Some additional ORFs were added to complete systems
on the basis of their strong similarity to a partner in the
system.

Some ABC systems were found to be located in the
genome islands which were previously identified in B.
pseudomallei K96243 [5]. The orthologous ABC system
component proteins of B. pseudomallei K96243 and B.
mallei ATCC 23344 were identified as proteins with > 90%
identity when the ABC proteins of B. mallei ATCC 23344
were compared by BLASTP [38].
