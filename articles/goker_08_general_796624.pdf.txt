Abstract
Background: Amongst the most commonly used molecular markers for plant phylogenetic
studies are the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacers (ITS). Intra-individual variability of
these multicopy regions is a very common phenomenon in plants, the causes of which are debated
in literature. Phylogenetic reconstruction under these conditions is inherently difficult. Our
approach is to consider this problem as a special case of the general biological question of how to
infer the characteristics of hosts (represented here by plant individuals) from features of their
associates (represented by cloned sequences here).
Results: Six general transformation functions are introduced, covering the transformation of
associate characters to discrete and continuous host characters, and the transformation of
associate distances to host distances. A pure distance-based framework is established in which
these transformation functions are applied to ITS sequences collected from the angiosperm genera
Acer, Fagus and Zelkova. The formulae are also applied to allelic data of three different loci obtained
from Rosa spp. The functions are validated by (1) phylogeny-independent measures of treelikeness;
(2) correlation with independent host characters; (3) visualization using splits graphs and
comparison with published data on the test organisms. The results agree well with these three
measures and the datasets examined as well as with the theoretical predictions and previous results
in the literature. High-quality distance matrices are obtained with four of the six transformation
formulae. We demonstrate that one of them represents a generalization of the Sørensen
coefficient, which is widely applied in ecology.
Conclusion: Because of their generality, the transformation functions may be applied to a wide
range of biological problems that are interpretable in terms of hosts and associates. Regarding
cloned sequences, the formulae have a high potential to accurately reflect evolutionary
relationships within angiosperm genera, and to identify hybrids and ancestral taxa. These results
corroborate earlier ones which showed that treelikeness measures are a valuable tool in
comparative studies of biological distance functions.

Background
Multicopy gene regions such as the nuclear ribosomal
DNA spacers may exhibit significant heterogeneity within
the same individual. Such intra-individual variability can
cause serious problems for phylogenetic reconstructions
that use a dichotomous tree as the general model of evolution, and has been generally referred to as "paralogy" [16]. The internal transcribed spacers ITS1 and ITS2 of the
nuclear DNA region encoding for the 18S-5.8S-25S ribosomal RNA cistron, the 35S rDNA are amongst the most
commonly used molecular markers for plant phylogenetic
studies [3,5]. As far as it has been studied, intra-individual
ITS variability is a very common phenomenon in plants
[7-24] and has been attributed to numerous causes, such
as (i) incomplete concerted evolution among the multiple
copies of 35S rDNA located within the same nucleolus
organizer region (NOR); (ii) the general potential of the
NOR regions for intragenomic recombination between
both parental chromosomes; (iii) ITS homoeology, i.e.
the persistence of two or more independently inherited
arrays of 35S rDNA as found for allopolyploids with more
than one NOR; (iv) ITS pseudogeny, i.e. the occurrence of
non-functional copies of rRNA genes, and (v) gene paralogy in a strict sense, i.e. the existence of several rDNA loci
coding for functionally differing rRNAs. Whereas incomplete concerted evolution, intragenomic recombination,
ITS homoeology and ITS pseudogenes have been documented in [[1,9,12,14,16,18,22,23] and [25]] (among
many others) and can be considered to be natural phenomena, paralogs have not yet been observed in the case
of the 35S rDNA, but have been observed in the case of
"oocyte-type" and "somatic" 5S rRNA genes active during
early development of Xenopus laevis [26-29].
Cloned sequence data that effectively cover the intra- and
inter-individual ITS variability of morphologically
defined taxa have been subject to detailed studies in
angiosperm genera such as Acer (Sapindales, Sapindaceae) [9,11,30], Fagus (Fagales, Fagaceae) [9,23,24,30]
and Zelkova (Rosales, Ulmaceae) [22]. Significantly high
ITS variability not linked to pseudogeny was found particularly in species that are considered to be diploid; hence,
other effects in addition to ITS homoeology were taken
into account for the observed heterogeneity. For Acer and
Fagus species, it could be shown that intra-individual ITS
variability contained strong taxonomic information: Morphologically distinguishable but closely related taxa
("species" or "subspecies") exhibited identical or highly
similar (< 1% sequence divergence) ITS variants in addition to taxon-specific ITS variants not found in the sister
taxon [9,11,23,24,30]. In particular, intra-individual ITS
variability in Fagus was found to be as high as or higher
than the overall interspecific divergence [23,24]. This puzzling observation fitted well with the fossil history of this
genus, which indicates several phases of unhindered hor-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/86

izontal gene flow among spatially and temporarily isolated "species" during the Tertiary, as well as known
ecological differences between the species [23]. In an
experimental approach, Grimm et al. [31] coded the
occurrence or lack of a certain nucleotide polymorphism
as phylogenetic characters for species-based matrices,
which were analysed with maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood. A nucleotide matrix comprising several
cloned ITS sequences per individual and a number of
individuals per morphologically defined "species" was
transformed into a matrix of characters of the "STANDARD" type of the NEXUS format used by PAUP* [32],
with the morphologically defined taxa and biogeographically circumscribed "populations" as Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs). Sites reflecting no polymorphism
(e.g., always "C") were coded as "0", whereas their polymorphic counterparts (e.g., "C" and "T") were coded as
"1". More complex variability patterns were coded using
up to eight character states. As a result, Grimm et al. [31]
inferred a more detailed molecular phylogenetic hypothesis than would have been possible by using the primary
(untransformed) sequence data, supporting the phylogenetic scenario predicted earlier [23].
Despite those promising results, the coding of the occurrence or loss of a nucleotide polymorphism as a phylogenetic character of a predefined species can be
methodologically critical. The mutational constraints
affecting intra- and inter-genomic competition among ITS
variants are not as well studied as the degree of intragenomic recombination. Knowing this could allow us to
decide if it makes sense to regard the occurrence (or lack
of) a nucleotide polymorphism as a character under maximum parsimony, and would be crucial to define the likelihood that such a polymorphism occurs quantitatively.
To minimize coding bias, Grimm et al. [9] relied on
detailed visual investigations of the nucleotide sequence
motifs and general polymorphic patterns (further details
given in [30]), a procedure which was extremely time-consuming and, to some extent, subjective. One could avoid
such problems if one could develop a function that allows
us to convert a data matrix of the clones into a data matrix
of the plant individuals (or of greater taxonomic units)
directly.
However, due to the multiple reasons for ITS polymorphism discussed in the literature (above), it is, at present,
hard to rely on an explicit statistical model of the evolution of multiple copies to infer the phylogeny of the individuals. For instance, Joly and Bruneau [33] described a
distance transformation method to include allelic variation in phylogenetic reconstruction, which can only be
applied if exactly one or exactly two alleles are present in
each individual. In contrast, our approach is based on the
notion that different biological phenomena can be

described in terms of hosts and their associates, and that
similar methodologies can be applied to solve questions
related to the different types of host-associate pairs. Hostassociate pairs are, for instance, areas and species, host
species and their parasite or mutualist species, or individual organisms and individual genes [34-36]. Methods
such as Brooks Parsimony Analysis (BPA) have been suggested as a means of inferring area cladograms from species trees as well as host trees from parasite or mutualist
trees [37-39]. In the following, we thus derive and empirically test approaches that could be applied directly (or
after minor modifications) to all kind of associate character data, be it morphological or sequence data of individuals in certain geographic areas or habitats, parasites or
mutualists on certain host organisms, or genes and
sequence variants present in certain individuals. The obvious advantage is that any method found to be useful for
cloned ITS sequences and plant individuals may also be
useful in other fields of research dealing with host-associate pairs [34-36].
In contrast to the original formulation of BPA [37], which
infers host trees from single to multiple associate trees, we
here will confine ourselves to distance methods in combination with phylogenetic networks for several reasons.
Firstly, both trees and networks can be inferred from distance matrices, but networks represent many evolutionary
processes in a more comprehensive manner than trees,
and evolution is not necessarily treelike [40-44]. For similar reasons, Joly and Bruneau [33] also relied on networks
in examining their distance transformation method for
allelic data. Whereas distance methods have already been
criticized for losing phylogenetic information more than
two decades ago [45], they may even represent the data
better than common character-based methods, particularly in combination with network analyses [44], which
could not yet well be combined with the maximum-likelihood criterion. Secondly, the phylogenetic quality (treelikeness) of distance matrices may be measured directly
without deriving a tree. Instead, helpful but apparently
underused indices such as Q values [46], Delta values [4749], or additivity (as implemented in OVW; [50]) can be
applied. Thirdly, congruence between datasets can be
tested directly on distance matrices [51,52]. While concordance between trees is mostly measured with formulae, such as the Robinson-Foulds distance [53], which
disregard branch length information and do not indicate
whether the similarity between the trees is significant
(e.g., [54]: p. 528–535), permutational regression
approaches for distance matrices [51,52] allow one to test
the null hypothesis of no congruence between the datasets. Even though permutational regression could be
applied to patristic (path-length) distances derived from
trees with branch lengths [55], it may be more appropriate
to use the "noisier" pair-wise phenetic distances (e.g.,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/86

[56]), particularly if they are not well represented by a tree
[40-44]. This is also more efficient, since inferring trees (as
two additional computational steps) can be omitted.
In principle, derivation of host from associate distance
matrices can be done by two means (Fig. 1). Either (i) the
associates' character matrix is converted to a character
matrix of the hosts, the latter being used to compute host
distances, or (ii) distances between the associates are computed from the associates' character matrix and the resultant distance matrix is converted to a distance matrix of the
hosts. An example of the latter approach, restricted to up
to two associates per host, is presented in the study of Joly
and Bruneau [33].
In the present study, we apply such functions to compute
distances between plant individuals as operational taxonomic units (as the hosts) from molecular data matrices
that exhibit significant intra-taxon sequence heterogeneity
reflected by cloned ITS data (as the associates). The quality
(treelikeness) of distance matrices is estimated using the
Delta value approach [47-49]. Delta values can also be calculated for individual taxa and may be indicative of
hybridization and/or recombination [49]. To identify the
distance formulae best suited for the tasks of interest, we
also investigate the correlation between the resultant distance matrices and matrices based on morphological distances as an external, independent dataset; this
investigation will include permutational statistical tests
[52]. Whereas morphological data are often regarded as
intrinsically inferior to molecular characters, more thorough analyses do not confirm that view [57]. In the context of a parsimony framework, congruence between
(molecular and/or morphological) datasets has been suggested as a selection criterion for character change costs in
sequence alignment and a subsequent tree search [58];
here, we use congruence to compare associate-host transformation methods. To be able to correlate morphology
and cloned ITS data covering the intra-individual variability of corresponding individuals, we focus on the abovementioned datasets of Acer section Acer [9], Fagus [23,59]
and Zelkova [22]. For these taxa, literature data indicate
that the respective patterns of morphological and ITS differentiation fit into uniform evolutionary and systematic
concepts, i.e., are qualitatively congruent (see above).
Thus, correlation of morphological and transformed
molecular matrices represents a natural means of quantitatively validating the proposed transformations.
We also test the sensitivity of each distance function
against sample numbers of associates per hosts (here, the
number of clones that represent an individual), making
use of the above-mentioned permutational test, and
against gap handling techniques (as "missing data" or as
a "5th state" over and above the four nucleotides). Finally,

Overview of the distance methods and the tests applied
Overview of the distance methods and the tests applied. The picture describes the pure-distance framework developed in the course of the present study for testing methods of deriving host character data and/or distance matrices from
associate character data. The location of the methods for character-character transformation (ENT, FRQ, CON, MOD) and
for distance-distance (MIN, PBC) transformation is indicated. Integrating the SIZ distances (that are biologically meaningless in
the case of cloned sequences) allows us to test for a potential sampling size bias. Abbreviations: CM, character matrix; DM, distance matrix. See the methods section for the abbreviations for the transformation methods.

the outcome of the analyses is discussed briefly in the light
of the evolutionary framework for each group, as established in the original literature, using a combination of
ITS data, morphology and fossil evidence. As additional
empirical tests, we apply the transformation functions to
the three datasets presented in [33]; the resulting networks
are compared to those obtained with the transformation
formula presented in Joly and Bruneau [33].
In addition to this empirical assessment of the distance
formulae, implementations of these algorithms are provided as executables for the three most popular operating
systems. Regarding Delta Values, we also provide a comprehensive implementation that significantly extends the
capabilities of the Python script used in [48], which is, to
the best of our knowledge, the only implementation available so far.

Results
Sampling size bias, distance quality and correlation with
morphology
Correlations of the transformed distances with SIZ distances, which were designed for detecting a potential bias
related to sampling size (i.e., the number of cloned
sequences obtained per plant individual), were statistically significant in some cases (SIZ distance matrices are

provided in Additional file 1; full correlation matrices,
including Spearman correlation values and permutational
probabilities as calculated with CADM, are provided in
Additional file 2). In Acer, a significant correlation
between PBC and SIZ distances was observed if a sampling size threshold of 2 was applied and gaps were
treated as missing character states; the correlation disappeared if the minimum number of associates required was
incremented by 1 (and therefore, we omitted plant individuals for which fewer than three sequences were
obtained). Whereas molecular distances inferred from
Fagus sequences never displayed significant correlations
with SIZ, the correlation of Zelkova SIZ and ENT distances
as obtained by treating gaps as missing character states
and by applying a threshold of 2 was significant, but this
also became insignificant if the minimum number of
associates required was increased. Therefore, in the following, we confined ourselves to the results obtained with
a threshold of 3, which resulted in host datasets comprising 39, 28 and 11 taxa for Acer, Fagus and Zelkova, respectively.
Regarding Delta values (DV) for entire distance matrices,
results differed between data sources (Fig. 2; all DV are
provided in Additional file 1, along with all the distance
matrices obtained). Acer distances showed relatively low

values, indicating high treelikeness; variability between
the different methods applied was low. The DV for Acer
distances were mostly located between 0.189 and 0.245,
and received higher values with ENT distances only. In
Fagus, the DV were much higher in general (0.214–0.346)
and displayed more differences between the distance
methods applied. In Zelkova, the overall highest treelikeness was observed (a DV of 0.132 was obtained with
MOD distances and gaps treated as a 5th character state),
but variability between the distance functions was also
highest (up to a DV of 0.314 for ENT distances combined,
with gaps treated as missing data).
The different character and distance transformation functions resulted in even more pronounced differences
regarding the treelikeness of the matrices (Fig. 3). ENT distances
rather

produced
high
DV
(0.293–0.329). Treelikeness of CON matrices was even
lower in some cases, whereas variability was much higher
(0.216 – 0.346). MIN and PBC DV were generally much
lower and similar in size to each other, but variability was
more pronounced in the latter. MOD and FRQ achieved
the lowest DV and were also similar in the variance of
their treelikeness. In general, DV were lower if distance

matrices were inferred and gaps were treated as a
5thcharacter state (Fig. 4).
The correlation between molecular and morphological
distances was significant at p = 0.01 in all cases except for
all Acer ENT distances as well as Zelkova ENT distances
combined with gaps treated as a missing character state;
these distances correspond to the correlation coefficients
below 0.3 in Fig. 5. In contrast to the results for treelikeness, on average, correlation values are highest for Fagus
and lowest for Acer. MIN/5th state for Fagus (0.818), FRQ/
missing for Zelkova (0.814) and PBC/missing for Acer
(0.677) received the best correlation with the corresponding morphological matrices.
Regarding the differences between the transformation
functions, the behaviour of the correlation coefficients
(Fig. 6) paralleled that of the DV: formulae that resulted
in lower DV also displayed higher correlations with the
morphological distances. The correlation was lowest in
the case of ENT (even though the variance is considerable), followed by CON. FRQ, MIN, MOD and PBC displayed relatively high correlation values, ranging from
0.516 (Acer/FRQ/5th state) to 0.818 (Fagus/MIN/5th state).

On average, correlation coefficients were higher if gaps
were treated as missing character states (Fig. 7), even
though the corresponding DV were lower.
Results obtained for North American Rosa sequences [33]
(the complete results are shown in Additional file 3) were
similar to those described above. With a single exception,
the DV were considerably larger for ENT than for the other
transformation functions (Fig. 8); MOD distance matrices
(equivalent to CON for up to two associates per host)
were somewhat less treelike than those of FRQ, MIN and
PBC. In the case of the Rosa datasets, treating gaps as a fifth
state resulted in a lower DV (not shown). Triose phosphate isomerase sequences resulted in less treelike matrices than glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and
malate synthase sequences (not shown).
Individual Delta values
The individual DV (iDV) based on the best performing
distance transformations (FRQ, MIN, MOD and PBC
combined with gaps treated as missing data) varied considerably between plant specimens (Table 1 and Additional file 4). Markedly increased iDV in Acer section Acer
were found in representatives of group B4 (A. saccharum
subspecies; accessions gd 1, ni A) and individual us 11 (A.
cf. monspessulanum; iDV > 0.28 with PBC, FRQ, MOD;
Table 1). The pattern was most pronounced in ni A (highest iDV) and us 11 (2nd highest iDV). Individuals of

potentially hybrid origin with homoeologous ITS
sequences showed medium to comparably low iDV, e.g.
A. × pseudo-heldreichii individual hd 1: 0.168 (FRQ) to
0.197 (PBC), xx 5 (A. monspessulanum with partly recombinant ITS): 0.169 (MOD) to 0.260 (MIN). In Fagus, iDV
were generally high (e.g., 0.224 to 0.379 for PBC). Above
average iDV were characteristic of individuals of F. hayatae, F. longipetiolata, F. lucida and F. sylvatica from Turkey
and Georgia, whereas below average iDV were typically
found in F. grandifolia and subgenus Engleriana (F.
japonica, F. engleriana). Zelkova had the lowest iDV (e.g.,
between 0.144 and 0.237 for PBC). Here, the MIN and
MOD transformations produced less treelike data (iDV >
0.20/0.19 respectively) than FRQ and PBC; based on PBC,
the only iDV exceeding 0.2 was confined to individual cp
2. The same individual also showed the maximum iDV
with FRQ, where all iDV were below 0.2. The hybrid individual se 2 (Z. cf. serrata, based on ITS: Z. schneideriana ×
Z. serrata) had low iDV with PBC and FRQ, and high or
even maximal iDV with MIN and MOD.
The iDV of the plant individuals mostly reflected the iDV
calculated directly from p distances between the cloned
sequences (treating gaps as missing data; also included in
Additional file 4). For Acer, all clones of the A. saccharum
subspecies (group B4) exhibited the largest iDV
(0.207–0.333), as did the clones of the individual us 11
(0.252 – 0.273). The same is true for chimeric (recom-

binant) clones (e.g., xx 3, xx 5, sv4b). In Fagus, a similar
correlation between iDV of clones and plant individuals
was found; for instance, the minimal iDV of 0.238 was
obtained for clones of gr-5104 (individual gr 51, F. grandifolia from Mexico) in contrast to 0.387 for the clone or618 (individual or 6, F. sylvatica from northwest Turkey).
For Zelkova, a comparison of iDV of clones with iDV of
plant individuals revealed that FRQ and PBC reflect a
major feature of the original character or distance data:
Four of the six clones representing cp 2 were among the
18 clones with iDV > 0.250, but only one clone of either
si 2 (highest iDV based on MIN) and se 2 (MOD) were in
this group.
Phylogenetic networks
Naturally, the similarity between the reconstructed networks correlates with the congruence between the underlying distance matrices. The four transformation methods
(FRQ, MIN, MOD and PBC) that resulted in high correlations with morphology and in low DV produced very similar Neighbor-Net splits graphs (details not shown, but
Additional file 1 contains all distance matrices calculated
for import in SplitsTree, as well as the pair-wise correlations between all distance matrices). In the following, we
thus focus on the description of the networks based on
PBC distances. The PBC-inferred network of Acer section
Acer (Fig. 9) exhibited two general elements. First, genetically unambiguous individuals (or local groups of co-

occurring, taxonomically identical individuals) clustered
according to their taxonomic affiliations ("species" and
"subspecies") and the intra-sectional groups A0 to B4 (Fig.
9). Each group, except for group B2, was characterized by
prominent parallel edges and a rather treelike appearance
in the corresponding portions of the graph. Second, three
individuals were placed as terminals of large box-like
structures: (1) hd 1, representing a putative hybrid of A.
heldreichii and A. pseudoplatanus (A. × pseudo-heldreichii),
(2) of 2, material from a historical herbarium sheet of A.
obtusifolium from Syria, and (3) sv4b, a morphologically
unequivocal A. sempervirens individual from Crete. All
three individuals were characterized by potential ITS
homoeologues [9]. Aside these two major features, the
following could be observed: The individual us 11, taxonomically treated as A. cf. monspessulanum, was placed
near the center of the graph; the most prominent edge
bundles related it to group B1 or A2. The center of the
graph was dominated by relatively short edges; however,
the two most prominent central edges related group B1 to
group B2, and group A1 to the (potential) outgroup A0.
In the PBC network of Fagus (Fig. 10), four major groups
could be distinguished. A long edge bundle distinguished
between the two subgenera Engleriana (F. engleriana, F.
japonica; I) and Fagus (all other species). Within the latter,
individuals representing the Northern American F. grandifolia (II) were clearly separated from the remaining Eura-

sian taxa. Of the Eurasian taxa, individuals of F. hayatae
and F. longipetiolata (III, except lo 1 and lo 2) were placed
next to each other as terminals of a pronounced box-like
substructure. All other individuals were organized in a
star-like manner; the longer proximal edge bundles further related both individuals of F. crenata (IV).
The PBC-inferred Neighbor-Net splits graph based on ITS
data of Zelkova (Fig. 11) had a "giraffe-like" general
appearance, reflecting a biogeographical differentiation
pattern. A prominent box-like structure (the "torso" of the
giraffe) was created by Z. carpinifolia from the Caucasus
(individual cp 2 made the "foreleg"), individuals representing the Chinese Z. schneideriana that made the "hind
legs" and "tail", and a French Z. cf. serrata cultivar (se 2)
and the Japanese-based Z. serrata (se 5) that formed the
backbone. The "head" of the splits graph giraffe was separated from the "torso" by a pronounced "neck" comprising the Mediterranean Zelkova individuals of the (very)
closely related species Z. abelicea and Z. sicula.
Regarding the Neighbor-Net splits graphs of the Rosa data,
we chose to depict the PBC network computed from
malate synthase sequences (Fig. 12) because an annotated
network inferred from the same sequence alignment using
a different transformation algorithm was shown in Fig. 5
of [33]. The resulting network topologies are fully com-

patible. Three lineages, alpha, beta and Rosa section Synstylae, were indicated in [33], all of which are recovered in
the PBC network (Fig. 12). Topological relationships
within and between these lineages as well as with the
remaining OTUs are also congruent with those obtained
by earlier works [33]. As in the case of Acer, Fagus and Zelkova, the correlation between FRQ, MIN, MOD and PBC
distances were high (almost always > 0.9), and the resulting splits graphs were similar to each other and those
obtained in [33] (not shown; splits graphs can be inferred
from the distance matrices contained in Additional file 3,
which also contains all correlation matrices).

Discussion
General applicability of the transformation formulae
Of the six character-character or distance-distance transformations examined in the course of the present study,
four (FRQ, MOD, MIN and PBC) performed well with
respect to both treelikeness of the resulting distance matrices and correlation with morphology. In the case of the
Rosa datasets, the resulting network topologies are fully in
agreement with those obtained by Joly and Bruneau [33],
who used a distance transformation function restricted to
up to two associates per host. In the following, we will
focus on the technical applicability of the six transformation formulae; we will also show that while some formulae that are characterized by a combination of reasonable

performance and apparent simplicity (such as FRQ and
MIN), others are less simple, but can be justified by their
relation to coefficients that are well-known from statistics
(ENT, MOD and PBC). Before, we note that the considerable agreement observed between four of the six transformation functions and the morphological distances also
confirms the use of latter as reference datasets. This is not
circular reasoning; rather, because congruence between
distinct data sources is a reliable indicator that they reflect
the same underlying evolutionary history (e.g., [50]), the
high quality of the morphological datasets [22,23,59] is a
necessary condition for obtaining high correlation values.
Obviously, both ENT and FRQ can be applied to each type
of discrete character data. Only in the case of quantitative
and continuous characters such as morphological measurements need they be replaced by other appropriate
character transformations. For instance, ENT could be
replaced by the standard deviation or the range as typical
parametric or non-parametric statistics for the variability
of a sample. In fact, the statistical justification of the
entropy formula (formula 1) requires some considerations from information theory but is as widely used as a
coefficient for the variability of discrete data as are the
aforementioned statistics for continuous data (e.g., [60]: p
209, 240). FRQ could be applied to quantitative, continuous characters after transforming them to discrete charac-

ters by means of partitioning them into several clusters.
However, since most molecular (e.g. aligned nucleotide or
amino acid sequences) and morphological characters (e.g.
coded as presence/absence or as multiple discrete states)
are represented as a set of discrete character states, ENT
and FRQ can be applied directly in most cases.
The unfavourable performance of ENT distances with
respect to both Delta values and correlation with morphology is no surprise. We presume that ENT distances
will always almost discard at least some phylogenetic
information and that they will usually discard more information than their counterparts such as FRQ. Thus, ENT
distances may not represent the best method to uncover
evolutionary relationships between hosts. However, they
may be of use to clarify if and to what extent the common
ancestry of the hosts is reflected by the variability of associate characters alone. For instance, the correlation
between Acer and Zelkova ENT distances and the corresponding morphological distances was extremely low and
mostly insignificant, whereas Fagus ENT distances significantly correlated with morphology (see Additional file 2).
This corroborates earlier studies which concluded that the
distribution and amount of intra-individual ITS variability in Fagus directly reflects phylogenetic relationships
[23,30,31].

when computing p distances. For further explanations, see legends to Figs. 2 and 5.

A further difference between ENT and FRQ is that ENT
may be generally more susceptible to sample size, as demonstrated by the significant correlation with SIZ distances
for our data. However, testing the correlation with SIZ represents an easy means to correct for a potential sample size
bias, because raising the minimum required number of
associates to 3 resulted in insignificant correlations of SIZ
distances with all other formulae. Of course, if the
number of associates has a biological meaning (as in case
of the Rosa data), the correlation with SIZ cannot be used
as a selection criterion. A drawback of ENT and FRQ is that
they cannot be combined with distance formulae (or
methods of phylogenetic inferences) that make use of an
explicit model of DNA (or amino acid) evolution (e.g.,
[54,61]). However, both transformation methods could
be combined with bootstrapping, the standard method in
phylogeny to obtain branch support values (e.g., [54,61]),
if an implementation is available to bootstrap continuous
characters (currently, this cannot be done with, for example, PAUP* [32].) In the case of FRQ, block bootstrapping
would need to be applied, treating each sequence of character state frequencies that was computed from the same
character within the original data matrix as a single, independent character. In the current study, for the reasons
provided in the background section, we have preferred
networks over trees and bootstrapping, and we have omitted any of the more complex models of nucleotide site
substitution, as explained in the methods section.

As in the case of ENT, the low performance of the CON
transformation is not surprising. Because character states
that only appear once receive the same weight than highly
frequent states, a considerable loss of information may
occur. If all possible character states are present in the set
of associates of a single host, loss of information is total
(resulting in "N" or "X" in the case of nucleotides). Naturally, this problem has been noted earlier [33]. In contrast
to ENT, CON keeps track of the actual character states
present and thus the results are better in general (Figs. 3,
6). However, CON cannot be used to assess the correspondence between associate character variability and
host phylogeny (as can ENT), and because character transformations that perform better regarding phylogenetic
reconstruction have been found, a biological justification
for the use of the CON transformation of associate characters is not obvious. In fact, CON has been included in the
current study mainly because it makes use of the standard
approach to compute consensus sequences and to compare its performance with that of other formulae qualitatively and quantitatively.
As expected, in the case of a minimum number of associates (three), MOD considerably outperforms CON. Determining the mode is the standard method of obtaining a
representative value from qualitative characters, as are the
mean and median statistics for continuous data (e.g., [60]:
p. 185; [62]: p. 48). Most probably, the loss of informa-

results of [9]: Individuals (bold labels) of the same taxon ('species') and intrasectional group (A0 to B4) cluster together. The
position of potentially hybrid individuals (hd 1, of 2, sv4b) is pronounced and is directly visible from the graph because of the
large proximal box-like portions. These hybrid individuals exhibit ITS clones of different evolutionary origin (ITS homoeologues), highlighted for the example of individual sv4b. Clones of this individual either represented A. ibericum-type or group
B1-type homoeologues. Related edge bundles (reddish, bluish) can be addressed in the graph. Green squares correspond to
individuals that exhibited recombinant (chimeric) clones (see text).

is reasonable to assume that, in general, MOD loses more
information than FRQ because MOD disregards all character states that occur with less than maximum frequency.
In case of Z. carpinifolia, differences between the iDV of
the cloned ITS sequences are less well preserved by MOD
(and MIN) than by FRQ (and PBC), as further discussed
below. This may be considered as preliminary evidence
for the differences between the four transformation methods regarding the loss of information, even though all perform well with respect to overall treelikeness and
correlation with independent morphological datasets. An
advantage of MOD (and CON) is that the same methods
of phylogenetic inference can be applied to transformed
as well as untransformed characters. Thus, the full range of

methods for phylogeny reconstruction, including Maximum Parsimony and Maximum Likelihood, are available,
which could also be combined with bootstrapping (as
implemented in, for example, PAUP* [32]) to obtain
branch support values (e.g., [54,61]).
The general applicability of the PBC distance formula is
demonstrated by its relationship to the Sørensen distance
(or similarity) coefficient familiar to ecology (e.g., [60]: p.
256 and 275; [63]). Sørensen distances are frequently
used to visualize relationships between habitats based on
the presence and absence of species. An extension of Sørensen's coefficient introduced by Odum, as well as by Bray
and Curtis, allows us to take species abundances into

account [60]: p. 265 and 287. Sørensen's coefficient is
known as an "asymmetric" distance coefficient, because
double absence of a species from two habitats is not taken
into account; rather, the Sørensen distance Dxy between
two habitats (hosts) x and y relates the number of species
(associates) axy present in both habitats to the number of
species present in x only (ax) and present in y only (ay) in
the following way (e.g., [60]: p. 256 and 275):
Dxy: = (ax + ay)/(2axy + ax + ay)

(4)

The denominator of the Sørensen distance (Formula 4) is
always identical to that of the PBC distance (Formula 3),
because PBC adds the number of rows to the number of
columns of the reduced matrix (see the methods section).
Thus, PBC counts associates that occur in both hosts
twice, and those that occur in only one of the two hosts
once, respectively. Importantly, the numerator of PBC
(Formula 3) becomes identical to that of the Sørensen distances if PBC is computed from a phylogenetically unin-

formative associate distance matrix that contains 0 in the
diagonal and 1 in all remaining fields. In that case, the
sum of the row minima is identical to ai because 0 is
added for each associate being identical and 1 is added for
each associate being different in the two hosts; the sum of
the column minima is identical to aj for the same reasons.
Of course, if a phylogenetically uninformative distance
matrix that contains any positive constant k other than 1
in the non-diagonal fields is used as input, the resulting
distance will be identical to k times the Sørensen distance;
this just represents a means of rescaling.
For these theoretical reasons, we conclude that PBC is a
biologically meaningful generalization of Sørensen's distance coefficient to take the phylogenetic relationships
between the associates into account. From the viewpoint
of the more general PBC formula (Formula 3), Sørensen
distances are a special case that is based on a distance
matrix that contains information only on identity (zero
distances) and non-identity (positive constant k as dis-

individual correlates perfectly with its genetic (considering the potential hybrid individual Zse 2) and evolutionary background,
as sketched in [22], and highlighted by coloured edge bundles. Further colours used are: • blue, edge bundle distinguishing
between the Chinese Z. schneideriana (and Zse 2 exhibiting Z. schneideriana-type ITS homoeologues) and the closely related
other species; • reddish, edge bundles reflecting the evolutionary pathway from Z. carpinifolia (primitive, shares edges with the
sister taxon Z. schneideriana) through Z. serrata (more derived, secondary reticulation with Z. schneideriana) towards Z. abelicae
and Z. sicula (most derived); • green, edge bundle that correlates with differential relationships between and among Eastern

tances) but no further information on phylogenetic relationships. Accordingly, the new distance formula
(Formula 3) has been christened "Phylogenetic Bray-Curtis" after another extension of Sørensen's coefficient by
Bray and Curtis (e.g., [60], p. 265 and 287), abbreviated
"PBC".
It is reasonable to assume that PBC does not suffer from
the limitations of ENT, FRQ, CON and MOD, as described
above. Even in the case of a large number of highly divergent associates, the most similar associates of the second
host will be determined by the PBC algorithm. Importantly, there is a difference in perspective compared to the
transformation function presented by Joly and Bruneau

[33]. Even if the latter was extended to more than two
associates per host, in the case of an equal number of associates, it would assume that each associate of the first host
can only be linked to a single associate of the second host.
If and only if this assumption is justified biologically, the
algorithm of Joly and Bruneau [33] or an extension of it
may be the preferred transformation. However, our more
general algorithms appear to work well with the Rosa datasets, for which the assumption is reasonable.
Like PBC, MIN is also justified by statistical considerations. Minimum, maximum and median are standard
non-parametric statistics (e.g., [60]: p. 185; [62]: p. 45),
but only the minimum can be applied directly in trans-

forming distances (see the methods section). MIN has an
advantage over PBC because it is simpler. However, it may
be hypothesized that MIN loses more information than
PBC because the latter considers a larger proportion of
values in the reduced distance matrix. As mentioned
above, results obtained for the iDV of Z. carpinifolia are in
agreement with that prediction. On the other hand, if the
original dataset consisted of several clearly distinct associate lineages, PBC would be heavily influenced by the loss
of all members of any of the associate lineages in one or
more hosts because the row or column minima would
increase considerably. This behaviour of PBC may be
desirable with many datasets, such as several independent
lineages of parasites on the same host lineage, as in the
original BPA approach to infer the host from associate
cladograms [37].
To solve other biological questions, MIN may be the more
appropriate transformation. For similar reasons, PBC is
more heavily influenced by sampling size than MIN, as
indicated by the significant correlation with SIZ observed
with a low threshold value. Both MIN and PBC could be
integrated in an analysis pipeline that makes use of standard phylogenetic techniques such as an explicit evolutionary model and bootstrapping (see above). In contrast to
CON and MOD, these methods would need to be applied

before transformation, not afterwards. Joly and Bruneau
[33] emphasized the combination of transformed datasets
from several loci for phylogenetic analyses. MIN- or PBCtransformed distance matrices would require averaging
[33], which can be done using a Perl script provided
together with the transformation programs (see below).
Integrating the transformed character obtained using
CON, MOD, FRQ and ENT for the same sets of hosts is
straightforward because the datasets just need to be concatenated and the number of characters updated.
Phylogenetic implications
The splits graphs based on FRQ, MIN, MOD and PBC distances are in agreement with the evolutionary frameworks
that have been proposed for Acer section Acer [9], Fagus
[23] and Zelkova [22]. Because congruence between these
distance matrices and morphology is well documented by
the correlation results, for more details the reader is
referred to the original literature. In the following, we will
focus on the evolutionary interpretation of the iDV
obtained from these distances and whether they are able
to recover treelikeness observed within the matrices of
cloned ITS sequences. As demonstrated below, networks
based on the four character or distance transformations
obviously have a high capability to deal simultaneously
with a couple of "paralogy" phenomena that interfere

Page 15 of 24

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:86

with phylogenetic tree-building, such as "recombinant"
accessions, ITS homoeologues and reticulate signal in
general. These considerations also corroborate earlier
results that DV are a valuable tool for comparative studies
of biological distance functions [48].
Individual Delta values and the recognition of ancestral
taxa
Two taxa in Acer section Acer show generally high iDV,
based on the original molecular distances between the
cloned sequences as well as on the distance transformations. These are representatives of A. saccharum and its
subspecies, and the A. cf. monspessulanum individual us
11. Grimm et al. [11] noted that Acer section Acer falls into
two major lineages: A. caesium and the Acer core clade,
which finds further support in cpDNA data [64]. Nevertheless, the ITS sequence structure hints towards A. caesium as the closest extant relative of the Acer core clade
[11,30]. According to [9], A. saccharum (group B4) is at the
tip of an isolated lineage that originated shortly after the
formation of the Acer core clade (respective section Acer).
Based on motif analysis, they showed that subspecies
grandidentatum is closer to the common ancestor of the
whole section than its eastern relatives and that it has
retained several plesiomorphic sequence characters. An
extant sister clade can not be identified. The high DV mirror this finding. Analogously, A. cf. monspessulanum shows
a largely "primitive" ITS sequence, from which all ITS variants of group B2 can be derived [9]. In a cladistic analysis,
an ancestor would be placed as sister taxon to all its offspring, thus producing a polytomy if more than one sibling is included in the dataset. In network analysis, several
incompatible phylogenetic splits are promoted, reflecting
a generally non-treelike mode of evolution in agreement
with the high iDV.

The comparably high DV found for Fagus are in agreement
with the observation that (molecular) evolution in this
genus is non-treelike in general [23,30]. Accordingly, the
ITS data accumulated a high amount of incompatible signals [24,31], which interfere with phylogenetic tree-building and result in high DV, but can be handled using
adapted analyses, as done in [31] and the present study.
Morphology and ITS motif analyses [31] have provided
evidence that Z. carpinifolia is a more primitive member of
that genus, and could be a remainder of the evolutionary
source (ancestral population) from which Z. serrata and Z.
abelicea-sicula have evolved. In analogy to A. cf. monspessulanum and A. saccharum (subsp. grandidentatum), the iDV
of Z. carpinifolia, based on the distances between the
clones, on FRQ and on PBC distances, are higher than
those of other individuals. This pattern is not apparent
with MOD and MIN distances, which may be caused by

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/86

greater loss of information in the case of the latter transformations (see above).
Transformed distances and the recognition of hybrids and
recombinants
Grimm et al. noted the existence of putative ITS homoeologues in a few individuals and documented "recombinant" (chimeric) clones in the case of Acer section Acer
[9]. In analyses based on the original cloned ITS data, the
putative ITS homoeologues of one individual were
grouped with the putative parental lineages. For example,
clones of the possibly hybrid "A. ×. pseudo-heldreichii"
(individual hd 1) were grouped either with clones of A.
pseudoplatanus (group A2) or of group A1 (A. heldreichii, A.
trautvetteri and A. velutinum). Potential hybrid individuals
(hd 1, of 2, sv4b) are directly identified in the splits
graphs inferred from PBC distances, as they are placed
between their putative parents; a large box-like structure
with two prominent edge bundles is produced (Fig. 9).

"Recombinant" clones that are likely to be the product of
PCR artefacts in the case of individuals with (potentially)
homoeologous rDNA arrays [25] can distort phylogenetic
trees and can induce a systematic attraction between distantly related lineages. In the case of Acer, four individuals
exhibited chimeric clones, three of which are included in
the present dataset (cf. [9]: Appendix B). From two A.
monspessulanum specimens (xx 3, xx 5), recombinants
between A. monspessulanum-and A. opalus-typical ITS variants were obtained; in the case of the A. sempervirens individual sv4b, a recombinant of A. sempervirens and A.
ibericum ("short variant") homoeologues was obtained.
The recombinant clones obtained from Acer individuals
do not have a distorting effect: In the case of xx 3 and xx
5, the recombinant clones are outnumbered and compensated for by A. monspessulanum-specific clones; in the case
of sv4b, the recombinant perfectly fits into the general
homoeologous situation.
Intra-individual ITS variability in Fagus is often as high as
inter-individual or interspecific ITS divergence. Accordingly, the resolution of the phylogenetic trees was found
to be low [24]; only detailed visual investigation of
selected sequence motifs and ITS variability patterns
[30,31] allowed us to infer a fully comprehensive evolutionary scenario in correlation with morphology and the
fossil record [23]. The resultant PBC splits graph highlights several aspects of this data structure. As in phylogenetic trees [22,24,30], F. engleriana clusters with F.
japonica, and individuals of F. grandifolia are clearly distinct from the remaining representatives of subgenus
Fagus. In contrast to the ML phylogram based on the original clones [23], the strongly ITS-polymorphic individuals
of F. hayatae and F. longipetiolata are grouped together
(except for lo 1 and lo 2), which is in agreement with the

results of the variability coding [31]. Individual lo 1 is
placed next to F. lucida, which is in agreement with [23],
who has noted that one F. lucida (not included in Fig. 10)
has ITS characteristics that are more similar to F. crenata
and F. sylvatica, whereas the other individual's (lu 1) ITS
sequences have some similarities to some clones of F. hayatae and F. longipetiolata. Due to the increased intra- and
inter-individual ITS variability in some provenances of the
Western Eurasian F. sylvatica such as Turkey and Georgia
[24], it was difficult to distinguish it clearly from its Japanese sister species, F. crenata [23,31]. This is, however,
accomplished by the PBC-inferred distance networks (Fig.
10).
Ancient hybridization was assumed for the mostly diploid
genus Zelkova [22]; however, the corresponding box-like
structures are not readily visible in the PBC distance-based
splits graph, because of the large box-like structure in the
center of the graph (the giraffe's "torso" in Fig. 11). This is
due to the fact that inter-taxonomic distances among
clones of different Zelkova species are generally lower
than, for instance, in Acer. In the former, apparently only
a few mutations were fixed during the evolution of the
modern species; accordingly, the Hamming distances
between the clones are comparably small, as are the resultant PBC distances between the individuals. Nevertheless,
the grouping of the "hybrid" and "non-hybrid" individuals is in perfect agreement with the proposed molecular
evolution of Zelkova ITS [22]. The Z. cf. serrata cultivar se
2, genetically a hybrid of Z. schneideriana and Z. serrata, is
placed in between Z. schneideriana individuals and the
"true" Z. serrata representative, se 5. The second potential
hybrid (cp 1) is represented by only two sequences in the
original data and, hence, is not included in Figure 4. The
"foreleg" position (Fig. 11) of the second Z. carpinifolia
individual (cp 2) correlates to the finding based on motif
analysis that the ITS of Z. carpinifolia is most similar to the
ancestor of all Zelkova species [22].

Conclusion
Four of the six formulae introduced in our study performed well in reconstructing the evolution of three
angiosperm genera from cloned ITS sequences and of Rosa
from three different coding loci. In conjunction with
Delta values, the formulae were also able to identify
hybrids and ancestral taxa in the ITS datasets. The four
best-performing transformation functions apparently
allow us to analyse datasets that present intrinsic problems for traditional reconstruction methods due to "paralogy" in molecular data, which range from ITS variability
as the result of incomplete concerted evolution and
homoeologous data reflecting reticulation, to gene paralogs as a consequence of gene duplication, not to mention
homoploid duplications, incomplete lineage sorting, fast
ancient radiations, etc.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/86

A pure distance-based framework was established in
which these transformation functions were assessed using
three different approaches (Fig. 1), and the results regarding performance were in agreement with each other and
also corresponded to the theoretical expectations. Furthermore, results obtained with the three Rosa sequence alignments were fully in agreement with an earlier study [33]
that used a less general transformation function. Therefore, the outcome of the current study presents more than
anecdotal evidence, even though only six underlying
sequence datasets were examined. Nevertheless, additional investigations are necessary to further our understanding of these and other host-associate transformation
functions. For instance, simulation studies could clarify
the relative performance of the methods under welldefined evolutionary scenarios. In any case, our study has
demonstrated that treelikeness measures such as Delta
values are likely to be a valuable tool in future comparative studies, not only regarding entire distance matrices
but also regarding the recovery of individual treelikeness
values after transformation to distances between the
hosts.
Furthermore, due to the generality demonstrated for the
transformation functions, they can be applied to a wide
range of biological problems that can be interpreted in
terms of hosts and associates. For instance, Göker et al. are
currently conducting a simulation study (which is not
based on an explicit model of parasite evolution, but uses
the approach of [56]) to assess the suitability of the PBC
function for testing global co-phylogenetic patterns
between hosts and parasites. Because of its closeness to
the Sørensen coefficient, the PBC approach lends itself to
use in ecology. In contrast to Sørensen distances, PBC
does not require knowledge of the taxonomic affiliation
of the sampled species in advance. Rather, it determines
the most similar specimens between two habitats automatically when computing pair-wise distances from the
reduced matrices (see below). PBC may thus be ideal for
cluster analyses of habitats from which large samples of
character data have been collected in a standardized manner, for instance, in the course of metagenomics projects
(e.g. [65] and references therein). MOD may be helpful in
phylogenetic studies to limit the number of OTUs by
replacing numerous associates (members of a predefined
taxon of a higher rank) with a single host (the respective
taxon), probably losing much less information than if
consensus or placeholder strategies were used. Various
applications are possible, and further transformation formulae are likely to be invented in future studies benefiting
from the general notion of associates related to their
hosts.

Methods
Molecular character data – cloned ITS sequence matrices
Our analyses make use of the ITS data matrices by Grimm
et al. for Acer section Acer [9], Denk et al. for Fagus [23]
and Denk and Grimm for Zelkova [22]. The assembled ITS
data cover genetic variability within the three model genera at different levels (intra-individual to inter-specific)
and were obtained mainly from individuals growing in
original stands. All individuals have been carefully revised
taxonomically and form the basis for the morphological
data matrices (in addition to individuals that were not
sequenced). All three ITS matrices contain data complicating phylogenetic tree-building, such as chimeric
sequences (potentially PCR-mediated recombinants in
Acer), significant intra-individual variability (incomplete
concerted evolution among ITS arrays in Acer, Fagus and
Zelkova), and ITS homoeologues (genetic hybrids in Acer
and Zelkova); the matrices comprise 242 (Acer), 137
(Fagus), or 55 (Zelkova) cloned sequences from 73 (Acer),
43 (Fagus), or 18 (Zelkova) individuals. That is, the
number of clones per individual ranges from 1 to 10
(Acer) or 1 to 5 (Fagus, Zelkova). The gaps present in these
matrices are relatively short (each gap is extended over
only few characters); hence, treating each single gap symbol as a 5th character state (see below) is unlikely to give
too much weight to gaps. ITS alignments in NEXUS format are included in Additional file 1; for accession numbers, clone labeling and additional voucher information,
refer to the original literature [9,22,23].
Morphological character data – independent set of data
matrices
For Acer section Acer, morphological characters related to
leaf anatomy and morphology of reproductive organs
(Table 2 in [9]) were assembled to discuss and interpret
the results of the molecular analyses in a spatio-temporal
framework, including evidence from the fossil record.
This information has been transformed into a matrix of
15 characters and 13 OTUs ("species"; Additional file 5)
using "STANDARD" characters [32] and differentiating up
to seven character states (T. Denk, GWG, person. comm.
2007). For Fagus and Zelkova, we relied on the published
data matrices of Denk ([59]: Table 4; 42 characters including features of leaf anatomy and morphology, cupule
morphology and pollen characteristics. See also [23]) and
Denk and Grimm ([22]: Table 4; 24 characters from leaf
morphology, leaf anatomy, wood structure and flower
and fruit characteristics). Characters of all three matrices
are defined to address the discrimination or overlap
between formerly recognized taxonomic entities ("species", "subspecies"); overlapping morphological features
are represented by polymorphic character states. Morphological matrices in NEXUS format are included in Additional file 2, for details of the characters, refer to the
original literature [22,23,59].

Character and distance transformations
To conduct and assess the transformations examined, four
computer programs were written by MG: G2CEF, which
converts associate to host characters; PBC, which converts
associate to host distances; EUKDIS, which calculates
Euclidean distances; and DIST_STATS, which calculates
Delta values. These programs have been implemented in
the Ada 2005 language, have been compiled for the three
main operating systems, and are freely available for download at [66]. The program versions used in the present
study are also included in Additional Data File 6. The programs are able to read data exported from PHYLIP [67] or
from PAUP* [32], which is currently the most popular
phylogeny software, and (apart from DIST_STATS) are
able to write data in formats readable by PAUP*, PHYLIP
and SplitsTree [44] (in the case of discrete character or distance data) as well as by PhyML [68] and RAxML [69] (in
the case of nucleotide character data). The programs can
read from standard input and write to standard output,
and can be used as stand-alone executables or integrated
in larger analysis pipelines. For instance, in the course of
our empirical assessments, they were called successively
by a UNIX shell script, which is less portable but is available from MG upon request.

There are basically two ways to derive a host distance
measure from the character data of the associates (Fig. 1).
The first approach consists of transforming the associates'
character matrix into a character matrix of the hosts and
then inferring a distance matrix from these characters. In
the following, we will describe four distance measures
which follow that approach and can be applied if, for
example, the associates' characters represent aligned
sequence data. An alternative family of methods computes pair-wise host distances directly from an associate's
distance matrix. The latter may represent phenetic distances derived from character data, or patristic (pathlength) distances [55] derived from an associate tree or
even from a list of taxonomic affiliations of the associates
[70]. Below, we also introduce two host distance measures
of the kind which can generally be applied.
A frequency (FRQ) character matrix is generated from
aligned sequences (or any other matrix of discrete characters) of the associate by converting the parts of each alignment (matrix) column that correspond to the identical
host into a vector representing the frequencies of each permitted character state (Fig. 13). Since unequal sampling of
the associates may frequently occur in empirical studies,
relative frequencies have to be used. The size of the resulting character matrix is the number of hosts times the
number of characters in the original associate matrix
times the number of valid character states (Fig. 13). Hosthost distances may then be computed from such a matrix
of quantitative, continuous characters using standard for-

mulae, among which, average Euclidean distances (e.g.,
[60]: p. 278) as implemented in EUKDIS probably represent the simplest and most natural approach. As in the
case of the transformations described below, states representing missing data are discarded by G2CEF before computing consensus sequences; the option -g regulates
whether gaps are treated as missing data.
Entropy (ENT) distances are based on a character matrix
representing the Shannon entropy [71] within each part
of an alignment column that belongs to the same host. If
q denotes the total number of character states and pi
denotes the relative frequency of character state i, the
Shannon entropy H (e.g., [50]: p. 240) is defined as

q

H=−

∑ p log p .
i

(1)

i

i =1

The size of an ENT character matrix is the number of hosts
times the number of characters in the original associate
matrix. As in the case of FRQ, variance in the sampling size
has to be accounted for. Thus, each entropy value is scaled
by dividing by the exact maximum possible entropy Hmax
for the given number of associates and valid character
states. Hmax can be computed with ease by generating an
artificial partial dataset in which the character states are
distributed as equally as possible among the set of associates. This implies that ENT is undefined if fewer then two
associates have been sampled from a host or else division
by zero would occur. As in the case of FRQ, average Eucli-

Figure 13
FRQ character transformation: a numerical example
FRQ character transformation: a numerical example.
This example illustrates the transformation of characters
according to FRQ: (a) hypothetical three-character nucleotide alignment for the associates A1 to A5; (b) distribution
of the associates on the hosts H1 and H2; (c) the three associate characters transformed to twelve (three times the
number of character states) characters of the host. The
standardized Euclidean distance between H1 and H2 calculated from these characters is 0.180.

dean distances can be computed from such a matrix if
characters with missing states are omitted from pair-wise
comparisons and the total number of characters (the
denominator of the distance function) is adjusted accordingly (-g option of the EUKDIS program). In contrast to
FRQ, ENT discards all information about the original
character state composition within each character and
each host's associates, and relies solely on the observed
variability within the respective character.
Consensus (CON) distances first apply ambiguity coding
to all character states present in the set of a single host's
associates and the respective character; in the case of DNA
data, the standard DNA nucleotide ambiguity coding is
applied. For example, if the individual's clones exhibit
either a "C" (cytosine) or a "T" (thymine) at a certain position, the individual's consensus nucleotide is "Y" (for
pyrimidine). Even though this kind of coding is confined
to DNA data, corresponding state recoding is possible
with each kind of qualitative data; for instance, in the
NEXUS standard as used by PAUP* [32], "Y" is just a
placeholder for "{CT}". Genetic distances based on consensus sequences can be calculated using the same variety
of approaches as for original sequences, based on more or
less complex statistical models of DNA evolution [54,61].
In the course of our analyses, we calculated simple uncorrected (Hamming) distances with PAUP* (DSET DIST =
P) because in preliminary analyses (not shown), we
observed that with the current data, the type of recoding
has a much greater effect on the correlation with reference
distances and on the Delta values than the nucleotide distance function applied. Furthermore, more complex models need not result in smaller Delta values [47,49] and the
Mantel test for congruence (e.g., [60]: p. 552; see below)
transforms distances to ranks, which would give identical
results for at least a considerable part of nucleotide distance formulae. Uncorrected distances that make use of
gap characters are not implemented in PAUP*. To examine the effect of considering gaps as a 5th character state
rather than as missing data, we therefore recoded the data
to "STANDARD" characters ([32]; FORMAT DATATYPE =
STANDARD), explicitly set the ambiguity code placeholders, and computed the mean distances (DSET DIST =
MEAN).
Mode (MOD) distances first determine the most frequent
value (i.e. the mode. See [60]: p. 185; [62]: p. 48) for each
host's associates and each character. If ties occur, a consensus character state is calculated from all modes using the
same algorithm as in the CON method (i.e., in the case of
nucleotide data, standard DNA ambiguity coding is
applied). CON, which uses all present character states;
and MOD, which considers only the modes, thus represent the two extremes of constructing a consensus charac-

ter state. Distances from MOD characters were computed
as for the CON method.

(a)

Another approach to derive a host distance measure from
character data of the associates is first to compute the distances between the associates, which are then transformed
to distances between the hosts. For the reasons provided
above and to increase the comparability between the following and the above-mentioned methods, we also considered uncorrected ("p") distances between the
associates only.
To determine the distance Dxy between two hosts x and y,
the first step in each of the following two distance formulae is to omit all rows which correspond to non-associates
of x from the associates' squared distance matrix and to
omit all columns which correspond to non-associates of y
from the matrix. Thus, a reduced matrix is obtained, the
size of which is the number of associates of x times the
number of associates of y. In the following formulae, let
dij be the distance between associates i and j, let Ax be the
complete set of associates of host x, and let Ay be the complete set of those of host y. The distance functions now
differ in how the distance between x and y is determined
from the distance values within the reduced matrix. The
MIN function computes their minimum:
Dxy: = min(dij|i ∈ Ax, j ∈ Ay)

(2)

If two hosts are characterized by exactly the same set of
associates, the minimum values are the diagonal zeros of
the associate distance matrix. This ensures that Dxy is
always zero if x and y are identical, a necessary prerequisite for considering a formula a distance function (e.g.,
[60]: p. 274). In contrast, formulae based on the arithmetic mean, the median or the maximum of the distance values contained in the reduced matrix do not have this
property. On the other hand, the MIN distance can be
zero between two hosts with different sets of associates
because a single shared associate will result in a zero value
present in the reduced matrix. Because the distance function described in [33] uses averaging, MIN results are different in the case of two associates per host, unless the
distances to the two distinct associates are identical. The
more elaborate PBC ("phylogenetic Bray-Curtis")
approach determines the mean of all row and column
minima, thus considering, for each associate of host x, the
most closely related (least distant) associate of host y
only, and vice versa:

Computation of PBC distances: a numerical example
Computation of PBC distances: a numerical example. This example illustrates the computation of PBC distances: (a) distances between the associates A1 to A6; (b)
distribution of the associates on the hosts H1 and H2; (c)
reduced matrix including in the rows associates of host H1
only and associates of host H2 only in the columns. The row
minima are 2, 0, and 2; the column minima are 2, 0, 6, and 6.
The PBC distance between H1 and H2 is (2+0+2+2+0+6+6)/
(3+4) = 18/7 = 2.571.

The symbol |Ax| denotes the number of members in Ax. A
numerical example for PBC is presented in Fig. 14.
According to Formula 3, Dxy is zero if and only if Ax and Ay
are identical because otherwise at least one of the row or
column minima, which have to be considered in the computation of the average, would be larger than zero. Other
properties of the PBC function, as well as the origin of its
name, are explained in the discussion section. The PBC,
applied to hosts with either one or two associates, is not
identical to the distance function described in [33] (which
cannot readily be generalized to more than two associates
per host) because the associate distance values to be averaged are selected in a different manner.
Distance quality estimation, correlation with external data
and detection of sampling size bias
The resultant distance matrices would allow us to infer
phylogenetic trees, e.g. by using the Neighbor-joining
algorithm [72]. However, for the reasons given in the
background section, we relied on the Neighbor-Net algo-

rithm [73,74] as implemented in SplitsTree version 4.8
[44] to compute splits graphs based on the resultant distance matrices.
Delta values [47-49] for the complete matrices as well as
individual OTUs (-i option) were computed with the program DIST_STATS. The DIST_STATS executables are
expected to give the same results for Delta values as the
Python script used in [48], but are expected to run much
faster (approximately by a factor of 30) because they are
written in a compiled language and the distance matrix is
stored in a linear array. Delta values are based on quartets
of taxa, and range between 0 (maximum treelikeness) and
1. Whereas Delta values (DV) are calculated by averaging
among all quartets in a dataset, individual Delta values
(iDV) are obtained by averaging among all quartets that
include the respective OTUs. There is exactly one DV per
distance matrix, but there are as many iDV as OTUs per
distance matrix; for further details, see [48] and [49].
For the correlation of molecular distance data with morphology, uncorrected distances were calculated with
PAUP* from the morphological matrices described above.
The congruence between distance matrices was assessed
using the CADM software [52]. Ordinary significance tests
cannot be applied because entries in a distance matrix do
not represent statistically independent characters. Hence,
CADM uses permutation (Mantel test; e.g. [60], p. 552) to
determine the significance of the Spearman's rank correlation between the distance matrices [51]; we used 999 permutations of the original matrices. (The software also
implements a test for the congruence of several matrices,
which was not applied.)
To detect a potential bias related to the sampling size, i.e.
the number of associates (clones obtained) per host
(plant individual), G2CEF and EUKDIS were used to calculate Euclidean distances between the numbers of associates per host. The resulting SIZ distance matrices were
included in the above-mentioned CADM permutation
runs, the rationale being that if any of the other distance
functions significantly correlated with the sample-size distances, the outcome needs to be considered as biased.
Based on preliminary observations, the complete set of
computations was conducted for minimum group size
values of 2, 3 and 4; hosts with a lower number of associates in the dataset were automatically removed prior to
analysis. These group-size thresholds can be applied automatically in both PBC and G2CEF (-m option). We determined the smallest threshold, for which a correlation of
SIZ significant at p = 0.05 with any of the other transformed distance matrices was not observed. Distances
matrices obtained with group sizes greater than this
threshold value were used for all visual comparisons of
networks and all boxplots.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/86

As an additional empirical assessment, and to compare
our results to those obtained by Joly and Bruneau [33], we
applied the six transformations to the three datasets examined therein, which were downloaded from [75]. The data
contain glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(matrix M2598; 66 sequences), triose phosphate isomerase (matrix M2600; 69 sequences) and malate synthase
(matrix M2599; 66 sequences) alleles obtained from
North American Rosa (Rosales, Rosaceae) individuals.
Since external independent datasets are unavailable for
these specimens, we treated them separately, confining
ourselves to calculating Delta values and visually comparing their networks to those presented in [33]. In contrast
to the Acer, Fagus and Zelkova datasets (in which the
number of associates per host is determined by the experimental success in PCR, cloning and sequencing) in the
Rosa datasets, the number of associates per host represents
the alleged number of alleles (one or two) per individual.
Therefore, for the Rosa data, the minimum number of
associates required was set to two and the sequences of the
single-allele host were duplicated. (This is necessary for
ENT only; the other transformations would give identical
results without duplication and with a threshold of one.)
Furthermore, because results are identical between CON
and MOD when there were one or two associates per
hosts, CON distances were not calculated.
