Abstract
Background: Shigella flexneri is one of the causative agents of shigellosis, a major cause of childhood mortality in
developing countries. Multilocus variable-number tandem repeat (VNTR) analysis (MLVA) is a prominent subtyping
method to resolve closely related bacterial isolates for investigation of disease outbreaks and provide information for
establishing phylogenetic patterns among isolates. The present study aimed to develop an MLVA method for S. flexneri
and the VNTR loci identified were tested on 242 S. flexneri isolates to evaluate their variability in various serotypes. The
isolates were also analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to compare the discriminatory power and to
evaluate the usefulness of MLVA as a tool for phylogenetic analysis of S. flexneri.
Results: Thirty-six VNTR loci were identified by exploring the repeat sequence loci in genomic sequences of Shigella
species and by testing the loci on nine isolates of different subserotypes. The VNTR loci in different serotype groups
differed greatly in their variability. The discriminatory power of an MLVA assay based on four most variable VNTR loci
was higher, though not significantly, than PFGE for the total isolates, a panel of 2a isolates, which were relatively diverse,
and a panel of 4a/Y isolates, which were closely-related. Phylogenetic groupings based on PFGE patterns and MLVA
profiles were considerably concordant. The genetic relationships among the isolates were correlated with serotypes. The
phylogenetic trees constructed using PFGE patterns and MLVA profiles presented two distinct clusters for the isolates
of serotype 3 and one distinct cluster for each of the serotype groups, 1a/1b/NT, 2a/2b/X/NT, 4a/Y, and 6. Isolates that
had different serotypes but had closer genetic relatedness than those with the same serotype were observed between
serotype Y and subserotype 4a, serotype X and subserotype 2b, subserotype 1a and 1b, and subserotype 3a and 3b.
Conclusions: The 36 VNTR loci identified exhibited considerably different degrees of variability among S. flexneri
serotype groups. VNTR locus could be highly variable in a serotype but invariable in others. MLVA assay based on four
highly variable loci could display a comparable resolving power to PFGE in discriminating isolates. MLVA is also a
prominent molecular tool for phylogenetic analysis of S. flexneri; the resulting data are beneficial to establish clear clonal
patterns among different serotype groups and to discern clonal groups among isolates within the same serotype. As
highly variable VNTR loci could be serotype-specific, a common MLVA protocol that consists of only a small set of loci,
for example four to eight loci, and that provides high resolving power to all S. flexneri serotypes may not be obtainable.

Background
Shigella flexneri, as well as S. dysenteriae, S. boydii, and S.
sonnei, are the causative agents of shigellosis, an acute
diarrheal disease common in developing countries. The
annual number of shigellosis cases throughout the world
has been estimated to be 164.7 million, of which 163.2
million were in developing countries, with 1.1 million
deaths, and 1.5 million in industrialized countries [1]. S.
flexneri is the predominant species in developing countries and the second most common in industrialized
countries [1,2]. S. flexneri comprises eight serotypes, 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, X, and Y, with at least 12 subserotypes, 1a, 1b,
1c, 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, 4a, 4b, 4c, 5a, and 5b [3,4], of which 2a
is the most prevalent subserotype in the world [1]. The X
and Y serotypes can be derived from some subserotypes of
serotypes 1, 2, 3, and 4, such as 2b, 4c and 5b for serotype
X and 1a, 2a, 4a and 5a for serotype Y, by losing the type
factor antigens [3-5]. Multilocus sequencing typing
(MLST) analysis has revealed that the S. flexneri serotypes
1-5, X and Y are evolutionarily more related than serotype
6 [6].
A variety of molecular typing tools have been developed
to access genetic relatedness among bacterial isolates. In
general, molecular markers with low variability can be
used to establish phylogenetic relationships among bacterial isolates evolved over longer time spans, and highly
variable markers are more useful to resolve closely related
isolates for the purposes of outbreak investigation and
disease surveillance. MLST, one of these molecular tools,
is a sequence-based method that has been successfully
applied to establish phylogenetic structure for some bacterial pathogens, such as Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae [7]. However, to public health
laboratories, MLST is not sufficiently discriminative in distinguishing closely related isolates for the epidemiological
investigation of clusters of infection. In contrast, pulsedfield gel electrophoresis (PFGE) is highly discriminatory
for many bacterial pathogens and has been adopted as the
standard typing method by an international molecular
subtyping network, PulseNet International, for foodborne
disease surveillance [8]. Although this method has been
proven by the PulseNet laboratories to be a powerful tool
for the routine subtyping of some foodborne bacterial
pathogens in detecting clusters of infection, PFGE is occasionally not discriminatory enough in distinguishing
some epidemiologically unrelated S. sonnei isolates. In
total, PFGE is suitable to resolve closely related isolates
but not an appropriate tool for establishing phylogenetic
relationships between bacterial isolates that have evolved
over a longer time span.
Multilocus variable-number tandem repeat (VNTR) analysis (MLVA) is prominent typing tool which has been
developed for a variety of bacterial pathogens [9-13]. This

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/278

method is based on variation in the number of repeats at
multiple VNTR loci, which can be highly variable or relatively stable. Study has demonstrated that MLVA based on
four to eight highly variable VNTR loci can exhibit a discriminatory power parallel to or higher than PFGE [14]
and that a method based on combined loci with different
variability values can be applied to establish phylogenetic
relationships among strains with different evolutionary
timescales [15]. In the present study, we aim to develop
and evaluate a MLVA method for fine typing and phylogenetic analysis of S. flexneri isolates.

Results
VNTR loci
In total, 36 VNTR loci were identified after testing 67
selected tandem repeat loci on nine S. flexneri isolates of
various subserotypes. The locations, copy number, and
sizes of amplicons for the 36 VNTRs in S. flexneri
sequenced strains 301, 2457T and 8401 and the gene or
encoding protein involved are listed in Table S1 (Additional file 1). Fifteen of the loci are located within pseudogenes. The 36 VNTR markers were analyzed on 242 S.
flexneri isolates of various serotypes and subserotypes. The
resulting data revealed that 28 of the 36 loci exhibited
100% typability (Table 1). Four loci (SF1, SF6, SF23 and
SF26) had a low typability rate that was primarily attributed to the absence of PCR amplicon from 103 4a/Y isolates, which had common origin. There were, respectively,
9, 26, 19, 13 and 3 polymorphic loci detected in serotype
groups 1a/1b/NT (non-typable serotype), 2a/2b/X/NT,
3a/3b, 4a/4b/Y and 6. There were three loci polymorphic
in four of the five serotype groups, nine in three serotype
groups, ten in two serotype groups and eleven in one serotype group. Three loci (SF20, SF28 and SF35) were not
polymorphic in any of the five serotype groups. Ten loci
bore alleles with a high copy number (м 6) of repeats
(Table 2). Of the 10 loci, one locus (SF3) was polymorphic in four serotype groups, 2 in three serotype groups, 4
in two serotype groups and 3 in only one serotype group.
Of the 10 VNTR loci, one that had low variability in the
serotype groups usually bore an allele with a low copy
number of repeats. SF12 was an exception; it had no polymorphism in the serotype groups 1a/1b/NT and 2a/2b/
X/NT, but it contained an allele with a high number (eight
copies) of repeats.
Phylogenetic relationships established using PFGE patterns
The PFGE analysis with NotI restriction enzyme identified
95 patterns among the 242 isolates. A dendrogram generated using the PFGE patterns is shown in Figure 1. The
dendrogram with detail information including isolate
code, PFGE code, serotype, year of isolation, MLVA code,
outbreak and origin other than Taiwan is shown in Figure
S1 (Additional file 2). Based on the serotypes and levels of
genetic similarity among the isolates, six clusters (C1 to

C6) and four singletons (S1 to S4) were designated. The
groupings were correlated with serotypes. The clusters C1
to C6, respectively, contained isolates of 4a/Y, 3a/3b, 1a/
1b, 2a/2b/X/NT, 6 and 3a. Isolates of serotype 3 were distributed in two distinct clusters, C2 (3a/3b) and C6 (3a).
The four single singletons were respectively assigned for
isolates with serotype Y, subserotype 2b, subserotype 4b,
and NT. S2 (2b), originated from Egypt, was far distant
from cluster C4 (2a/2b/X/NT). S4 (4b), originated from
India, was also distantly related from cluster C1 (4a/Y). A
serotype Y isolate and 102 subserotype 4a isolates within
cluster C1 was recovered from a prolonged shigellosis out-

break occurring in a long stay psychiatric center [16]; they
shared 76% or higher pattern similarity. These isolates
shared only 57% similarity with another subserotype 4a
isolate. The isolates within cluster C4 were further classified into three subclusters (C4a, C4b and C4c). Isolates
within each of the three subclusters shared 80% or higher
similarity. All the imported isolates in cluster C4 fell into
subcluster C4a. Subcluster C4c consisted of 10 serotype X
and two subserotype 2b isolates; the serotype X and one
subserotype 2b isolates were recovered from a shigellosis
outbreak.

Phylogenetic relationships constructed using MLVA
profiles
In total, 104 MLVA types were identified in the 242 isolates. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the MLVA
profiles and a minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithm.
The groupings established with MLVA profiles and PFGE
patterns were highly concordant, with 83.8% congruence.
On the basis of serotypes and the clusters established
using PFGE data, a MLVA cluster was defined for genotypes that differed at eight loci or fewer among the 36 total
loci. As a result, six MLVA clusters (MC1, MC2, MC3,
MC4, MC5 and MC6) and one singleton (MS2) were designated (Figure 2A). The groupings based on PFGE and
MLVA were almost consistent, except that the serotype Y
(S1) and subserotype 4b (S3) isolates were grouped into
cluster MC1 and the NT (S4) isolate was grouped into
cluster MC3. Cluster MC1 consisted of 107 subserotype
4a, two serotype Y and one subserotype 4b isolates. One
serotype Y and 106 subserotype 4a isolates were closely
related; the serotype Y isolate differed at only one locus
from the predominant type for subserotype 4a isolates.
The remaining subserotype 4a isolate differed at two loci
from a serotype Y (S1) isolate. The subserotype 4b (S3)
had a distance of at least seven loci from others within
cluster MC1. Cluster MC2 consisted of two subserotype 3a
and four subserotype 3b isolates; they were closely
related. One subserotype 3a isolate different at only two
loci from a subserotype 3b isolate. Cluster MC3 contained
three subserotype 1a, eight subserotype 1b and one NT
isolates. They formed three tight subclusters; one subcluster consisted of six subserotype 1b isolates, which were
recovered from an outbreak. Within this cluster, one subserotype 1a isolate differed at a single locus only from a
subserotype 1b isolate. Cluster MC4 consisted of 10 serotype X, 90 subserotype 2a, four subserotype 2b and one
NT isolates; they were relatively divergent. The three subclusters, C4a, C4b and C4c, designated on the basis of
PFGE similarity were indicated in Figure 2A. The isolates

in subcluster C4a showed a considerably diverse phylogenetic pattern; they were separated by subcluster C4b. The
imported isolates were distributed more closely than most
of others within this subcluster. The isolates in subcluster
C4b as well as those in subcluster C4c were grouped
tightly. Subcluster C4c consisted of 10 serotype X and two
subserotype 2b isolates; one subserotype 2b isolate displayed an identical profile with a serotype X isolate. MC6
consisted of six subserotype 3a isolates; they formed a relatively diverse phylogenetic pattern. The imported isolate
had a distance of at least eight loci from others within this
cluster.
Discriminatory power of PFGE and MLVA
PFGE, MLVA4 (an MLVA assay based on four most variable loci), MLVA8 and MLVA36 discriminated the total isolates into 95, 82, 90 and 104 genotypes, respectively
(Table 3). More genotypes were obtained by PFGE than
MLVA4 and MLVA8 but the level of discriminatory power
for MLVA4 and MLVA8 was, though not significantly,
higher than that for PFGE. For the panel of 90 diverse subserotype 2a isolates, MLVA4, MLVA8 and MLVA36 displayed better resolution than PFGE, though the difference
of discriminatory power was not significant. PFGE,
MLVA4 and MLVA36 divided the panel of 107 closelyrelated 4a/Y isolates into 19, 14 and 14 genotypes but the
two MLVA assays exhibited higher discriminatory power
than PFGE, though not significantly.
Subtyping of isolates from outbreaks
A total of 144 isolates recovered from eight shigellosis
outbreaks were used to evaluate the usefulness of MLVA in
discriminating isolates for disease outbreak investigation.
From outbreak A, 102 subserotype 4a and one serotype Y
isolates were recovered (Table 4), while 10 serotype X and
one subserotype 2b and were recovered from outbreak K.
Isolates from four outbreaks (A, B, D and K) displayed two

Isolates from four outbreaks (A, B, E and K) displayed two
or more MLVA types (Figure 2B). The isolates from outbreaks H and I, sharing a common PFGE pattern, had different MLVA types. The isolates from four outbreaks (C, D,
H and I) displayed only one MLVA type; notably, the isolates from these outbreaks were recovered over a short
time period. The 103 isolates for outbreak A, recovered
from a long-stay psychiatric nursing center over a long
time period (2001-2007), were chronically divergent; four
loci were variable among the isolates (Table 4). Outbreaks
B and K, which occurred in a military camp and a longstay psychiatric nursing center, respectively, lasted for
only a few days; however, the isolates were considerably
diverse. Four MLVA types were found in the six isolates
from outbreak B, with variations in two loci. Five MLVA
types were found in the 11 isolates from outbreak K, with
variations in four loci; a distance of three loci was seen
among the five types. The four isolates for outbreak E were
recovered over a period of six months; the first three isolates shared the same MLVA type but the one recovered
last differed at two loci from the first three.

level of genetic relatedness and serotypes. Isolates in each of
the three subclusters of cluster C4 shared at least 80% pattern similarity.

VNTR markers display a wide range of variability; combining VNTR loci with various variability values can be used
to discern various levels of genetic relatedness between
bacterial isolates. In our previous studies, we identified 26
VNTR markers for S. sonnei and evaluated the usefulness
of the MLVA method as a tool for fine typing and phylogenetic analysis of bacterial isolates [14,15]. These studies
indicated that MLVA based on four to eight highly variable loci is sufficient to resolve closely related isolates for
disease surveillance and investigations of outbreaks. In
contrast, combining loci with lower variability values are
suitable to establish clear phylogenetic patterns among
strains evolved over a longer time span. Theoretically, the
more number of loci are used, a higher discriminatory
power can be achieved and subtler phylogenetic relationships among bacterial strains can be established. Unlike S.
sonnei, which has only one serotype, S. flexneri has eight
serotypes with at least 12 subserotypes [3,4]. Since VNTR
markers can be serotype-specific, it is necessary to explore
more loci at the moment of development.
In order to identify as many VNTR markers as possible, we
explored VNTR candidates from the released genomic
sequences of S. flexneri and other Shigella species using the
VNTRDB computer program [17]. After testing 67 VNTR
candidates on nine isolates of different subserotypes, we
identified 36 loci that were polymorphic among the isolates. A further evaluation of the 36 loci on a total of 242
S. flexneri isolates from various serotypes and subsero-

that more variable loci could be found for the serotypes

Phylogenetic trees for Shigella flexneri isolates
Figure 2
Phylogenetic trees for Shigella flexneri isolates. The
phylogenetic trees are constructed with the MLVA profiles
using an MST algorithm for (A) 242 isolates and for (B) 144
isolates from eight outbreaks. (A) Six clusters, each includes
genotypes differing at eight loci or fewer among the 36 loci
with the closest one, are designated and marked by different
colors. The isolates in subclusters C4b and C4c defined by
clustering of PFGE patterns are marked in grey. The singletons and the minor serotypes or subserotypes within a cluster are marked. (B) Outbreaks are indicated by different
colors. Distances between outbreaks are numbered. A distance of one locus between two MLVA types is indicated by a
thick line, a distance of two loci by a thin blue line, and a distance of three loci by a red broken line. Distances of four loci
or greater are marked by a blue broken line. Distances
between two genotypes differing at 5 or more loci are numbered. The area of the circle is proportional to the number
of isolates belonging to the MLVA type.

types suggested that variability of some of the 36 loci
could be serotype-specific. For instance, seven loci (SF12,
SF16, SF19, SF23, SF25, SF29, and SF31) were not polymorphic among the diverse isolates within the 2a/2b/X/
NT group; but they were polymorphic among isolates in
the 3a/3b, 4a/4b/Y and 6 groups (Table 1). In addition,
SF25 and SF31 are highly variable in the 3a/3b group.
However, this observation of serotype specificity could be
biased because the number of isolates tested for a serotype
group was limited or may have been clonal. For the 2a/
2b/X/NT and 3a/3b groups, the isolates were relatively
divergent and more variable loci were therefore observed.
For the 1a/1b/NT, 4a/4b/Y and 6 serotype groups, the
number of isolates was either too small or most isolates

Many studies have indicated that MLVA is more powerful
than PFGE in discriminating bacterial isolates
[12][14][18]; thus, it can complement or replace PFGE as
a routine subtyping tool for outbreak investigation and
disease surveillance. In the present study we showed that
MLVA was able to discriminate isolates from two outbreaks that shared an indistinguishable PFGE pattern. For
the panel of 90 diverse subserotype 2a isolates, the MLVA
assays using four and eight most variable loci was able to
discriminate the isolates into more genotypes than PFGE,
although the discriminatory power was not significantly
greater (Table 3). A similar result was observed on a panel
of 107 closely related 4a/Y isolates. Although the MLVA
assay using four most variable loci discriminated the 107
closely related 4a/Y isolates into fewer genotypes than
PFGE, the discriminatory power for the MLVA4 assay was
higher than that for PFGE. As the resolving power of
MLVA to closely related isolates is primarily attributed to
highly variable VNTR markers [15], an MLVA assay based
on four to eight highly variable loci can display a resolving
power comparable to or higher than PFGE.
VNTR markers have various degrees of variability, making
MLVA as a useful molecular tool for phylogenetic study of
bacterial isolates. MLVA has been applied to investigate
the clonal relationships among isolates of Yersinia pestis
[19], N. meningitidis [13,20] and S. sonnei [15]. In the
present study, we used MLVA profiles to establish phylogenetic relationships among 242 S. flexneri isolates with
various serotypes. By defining a clonal group as one that
includes genotypes differing at eight loci or fewer between
the two closest genotypes, the grouping based on the
MLVA profiles is highly in agreement with that based on
the PFGE patterns (Figure 1 and Figure 2A). The analysis
based on MLVA profiles establishes clear phylogenetic
patterns among different serotype groups. The isolates of
serotype 3 are distributed into two distinct clonal groups,
suggesting that the MLVA method developed in this study
is also able to discern clonal groups among isolates within
the same serotype.
The phylogenetic analysis using MLVA profiles as well as
PFGE patterns also indicates that isolates with different
subserotypes within a serotype can be genetically more
closely related than those with the same subserotype. For
example, one subserotype 1a isolate in cluster MC3 is
more closely related to a subserotype 1b isolate than other
subserotype 1a isolates (Figure 2A). A similar result is also
observed between one subserotype 3a and one subserotype 3b isolates in cluster MC2. The analysis also indicates

Recently, Gorgé et al. [21] identified 15 VNTR loci by
exploring five genomic sequences of four Shigella species
for typing of Shigella spp. The 15 loci were evaluated on 89
isolates of E. coli and Shigella species including 19 S.
flexneri isolates of eight serotypes. Thirteen of the 15 loci
were polymorphic in the S. flexneri isolates. Of the 15 loci,
13 are included in the 36 loci identified in the present
study. Although MLVA based on the 15 loci could effectively distinguish between the isolates of four Shigella species and pathogenic E. coli, grouping analysis based on the
MLVA profiles was not able to distinguish among the four
Shigella species. Although MLVA may not be effectively to
establish phylogenetic relationships among isolates from
different species of the same genus due to the specificity of
VNTR markers; it can be a suitable phylogenetic analysis
tool for monomorphic bacterial species, such as S. sonnei
[15]. Our data indicate that the VNTR markers identified
in the present study are applicable to establish clear phylogenetic relationships among serotypes groups and discerning clonal groups among isolates within a serotype.
A total of 144 isolates from eight outbreaks were analyzed
using MLVA and PFGE in order to compare both genotyp-

ing methods in their ability to characterize isolates for disease outbreak investigation. MLVA was able to distinguish
PFGE-indistinguishable isolates from two S. flexneri 2a
outbreaks. MLVA also discriminated isolates from four
outbreaks into two or more genotypes. Theoretically, isolates collected from a prolonged outbreak, such as outbreak A, could have considerably been divergent, while
isolates from an outbreak lasting for a short time period
should have little variation. Strikingly, outbreaks B and K
do not follow this pattern. These outbreaks started and
ended within a few days but the isolates had showed considerably divergent. Several PFGE and MLVA genotypes
were detected among the isolates for each of the outbreaks
and no predominant type existed. This observation is difficult to explain. The strains could be hypervariable and
mutants could emerge very quickly in response to host
immunity, or the stains could have been circulating
silently in the institutions for a while.

Conclusions
A total of 36 VNTR markers were identified; they exhibited
different degrees of variability among various S. flexneri
serotype groups. VNTR locus could be highly variable in
isolates of a serotype but invariable in other serotypes. The
differences could be attributed to the fact that some of the
loci were serotype-specific, the isolates for a serotype
group analyzed were too clonal, or the number of isolates
for a serotype group was limited. MLVA based on four

highly variable loci is able to display a comparable resolving power to PFGE in discriminating isolates. MLVA is
also a useful tool for phylogenetic analysis of S. flexneri; it
can establish clear clonal patterns among serotype groups
and also discerned clonal groups among isolates within a
serotype, for example serotype 3. Isolates with different
subserotypes within a serotype can be genetically more
closely related than those with the same subserotype. Isolates that had different serotype but had closer genetic
relatedness than those with the same serotype were
observed between serotype Y and subserotype 4a, serotype
X and subserotype 2b, subserotype 1a and 1b, and subserotype 3a and 3b. As highly variable VNTR loci could be
serotype-specific, a common MLVA protocol that consists
of four to eight loci and that provides high resolving
power to all S. flexneri serotypes may not be obtainable.

Methods
Bacterial strains
A total of 241 S. flexneri isolates were collected in Taiwan
between 1995 and 2008, including serotypes and subserotypes 1a (3 isolates), 1b (8), 2a (89), 2b (5), 3a (8), 3b
(4), 4a (107), 4b (1), serotype X (10), Y variant (2), 6 (2)
and non-typable (NT) (2). One reference strain, S. flexneri
2a strain 2457T (ATCC 700930), was purchased from the
ATCC Global Bioresource Center. Among the isolates, 18
were recovered from patients infected during the travelling to Cambodia (4 isolates), China (6), Egypt (1), India
(3) and Indonesia (4), and 144 were recovered from eight
shigellosis outbreaks. Of the 107 subserotype 4a isolates,
102 were collected from a prolonged shigellosis outbreak
that occurred in 2001-2007 in a long-stay psychiatric
nursing center [16]; they were expected to be closely
related. In contrast, the serotype 2a isolates were chronologically divergent, even though 24 isolates were recovered from five shigellosis outbreaks.
PFGE
The PulseNet PFGE protocol for S. sonnei and other
enterobacteria was used for PFGE analysis [22] except that
5 U of NotI instead of XbaI was used for the restriction
digestion.
Identification of VNTR loci
Firstly, the three genomes of S. flexneri serotype 2a strain
301 (GenBank accession no. AE005674), S. flexneri serotype 2a strain 2457T (GenBank accession no. AE014073)
and S. flexneri serotype 5 strain 8401 (accession no.
CP000266) were explored for potential VNTR loci using
VNTRDB computer software developed by Chang et al.
[17]. As a result, 50 loci were selected for further evaluation. In order to maximize the number of VNTR markers
for S. flexneri, another search on five genomes of three
Shigella species, including S. dysenteriae strain Sd197
(accession no. CP000034), S. flexneri serotype 2a strains

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/278

301and 2457T, S. sonnei strains Ss046 (accession no.
CP000038) and 53G (Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute
http://www.sanger.ac.uk), was performed to explore
potential VNTR loci. Consequently, 17 additional loci
were selected for further evaluation. In total, 67 loci were
examined for their variability within nine S. flexneri isolates of various subserotypes by PCR amplification. To
perform PCR reactions, primers for the 67 loci were
designed using the Primer3 program available on the
website, http://frodo.wi.mit.edu. PCR reactions were carried out in a GeneAmp PCR System 9600 (Applied BioSystems). For PCR amplification, crude bacterial DNA was
prepared by the boiling method as described [14]. Each
10-μl PCR mixture contained 1x PCR buffer, 3 mM MgCl2,
0.2 μM of each primer, 200 μM of each deoxyribonucleotide, 1.0 unit of the recombinant SuperNew Taq DNA
polymerase (Jier Sheng Company, Taipei, Taiwan), and 1
μl of DNA template. The PCR reaction was performed
with a denaturing step at 94°C for 5 min, followed by 30
cycles of amplification at 94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 45 s, and
72°C for 45 s, and extended at 72°C for 5 min at the final
step. Loci with varied sizes among the nine isolates were
considered to be VNTR loci and the markers were used to
further analyze a total of 242 S. flexneri isolates.
MLVA
The primer sets for PCR amplification of 36 VNTR loci are
listed in Table S2 (Additional file 3). The forward primer
for each primer set was labelled at its 5' end with an ABIcompatible dye, 6-FAM, NED, VIC or PET by Applied BioSystems (Foster City, CA, USA). Nine multiplex PCR combinations were set for the analysis. PCR reactions were
performed as described above except that dye-labelled
primers were used. Occasionally, no amplicon was
detected for some loci by multiplex PCR; in these cases,
the loci were amplified individually. If no amplicon was
detected by amplification individually, DNA of the isolates prepared by a commercial kit (Geneaid, Taipei
County, Taiwan) was used for amplification. The PCR
products were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis on an
ABI Prism 3130 Genetic Analyzer with GeneScan 500 LIZ
Size Standard (cat # 4322682; Applied BioSystems) as
described [14].
Data analysis
PFGE images were analyzed using the fingerprint analysis
software BioNumerics version 4.5 (Applied Maths; Kortrijk, Belgium). A PFGE genotype was defined as a PFGE
pattern with one or more DNA bands different from the
others. A dendrogram constructed using the NotI-digested
PFGE patterns was generated by the UPGMA algorithm
with the Dice-predicted similarity value of two patterns at
1.0% pattern optimization and 0.8% band position tolerance. The number of repeat units for each allele was converted from the length of amplicon, saved as "Character

Type" in the BioNumerics database, and subjected to cluster analysis using the MST algorithm and categorical coefficient provided in the BioNumerics software. Creation of
hypothetical types (missing links) was allowed to introduce hypothetical types, group minimum size was set at 2
and maximum neighbour distance was set at 8. Alleles,
which contained imperfect repeat unit(s) due to deletion
or insertion, were designated by the lengths (in bp) of
amplicons. To compare the discriminatory power of PFGE
and MLVA with various combinations of VNTR loci,
Simpson's index of diversity (D) and 95% confidence
intervals (CI) were calculated according to the formulas as
the described [23,24]. The polymorphism of each locus
was represented by Nei's diversity index, calculated as 1-∑
(allelic frequency)2.
