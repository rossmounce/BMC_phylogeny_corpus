Abstract
Background: Mitogenomics data, i.e. complete mitochondrial genome sequences, are popular molecular markers used for
phylogenetic, phylogeographic and ecological studies in different animal lineages. Their comparative analysis has been used to
shed light on the evolutionary history of given taxa and on the molecular processes that regulate the evolution of the
mitochondrial genome. A considerable literature is available in the fields of invertebrate biochemical and ecophysiological
adaptation to extreme environmental conditions, exemplified by those of the Antarctic. Nevertheless, limited molecular data
are available from terrestrial Antarctic species, and this study represents the first attempt towards the description of a
mitochondrial genome from one of the most widespread and common collembolan species of Antarctica.
Results: In this study we describe the mitochondrial genome of the Antarctic collembolan Cryptopygus antarcticus Willem, 1901.
The genome contains the standard set of 37 genes usually present in animal mtDNAs and a large non-coding fragment putatively
corresponding to the region (A+T-rich) responsible for the control of replication and transcription. All genes are arranged in
the gene order typical of Pancrustacea. Three additional short non-coding regions are present at gene junctions. Two of these
are located in positions of abrupt shift of the coding polarity of genes oriented on opposite strands suggesting a role in the
attenuation of the polycistronic mRNA transcription(s). In addition, remnants of an additional copy of trnL(uag) are present
between trnS(uga) and nad1. Nucleotide composition is biased towards a high A% and T% (A+T = 70.9%), as typically found in
hexapod mtDNAs. There is also a significant strand asymmetry, with the J-strand being more abundant in A and C. Within the
A+T-rich region, some short sequence fragments appear to be similar (in position and primary sequence) to those involved in
the origin of the N-strand replication of the Drosophila mtDNA.
Conclusion: The mitochondrial genome of C. antarcticus shares several features with other pancrustacean genomes, although
the presence of unusual non-coding regions is also suggestive of molecular rearrangements that probably occurred before the
differentiation of major collembolan families. Closer examination of gene boundaries also confirms previous observations on the
presence of unusual start and stop codons, and suggests a role for tRNA secondary structures as potential cleavage signals
involved in the maturation of the primary transcript. Sequences potentially involved in the regulation of replication/transcription
are present both in the A+T-rich region and in other areas of the genome. Their position is similar to that observed in a limited
number of insect species, suggesting unique replication/transcription mechanisms for basal and derived hexapod lineages. This
initial description and characterization of the mitochondrial genome of C. antarcticus will constitute the essential foundation
prerequisite for investigations of the evolutionary history of one of the most speciose collembolan genera present in Antarctica
and other localities of the Southern Hemisphere.

Background
Mitochondria contain their own circular bacteria-like
genome (mtDNA) that is physically separated from that of
the cell nucleus. Metazoan mtDNA typically consists of a
covalently closed circular molecule, tightly packed with a
canonical set of 37 genes that encode for 13 inner membrane proteins, 2 ribosomal RNAs and 22 transfer RNAs.
These genes have no introns and, generally, few intergenic
spacers, the only exception being a large non-coding
region (A+T-rich region in hexapods) where essential regulatory sequences involved in the initiation of replication
and transcription have been identified [1,2]. The arrangement of genes along the mtDNA (gene order) is generally
conserved within major taxonomic groups, but can differ
extensively in specific lineages [3,4].
In the last few years, the genomic resources of public databases have accumulated a remarkable number of complete mitochondrial sequences for hexapods; these form
the largest data set of mitogenomic data available for
arthropods (59%: 81 of 151 sequences available in GenBank). Within Metazoa, the set of complete mtDNAs
known from hexapod species is outnumbered only by a
few vertebrate groups. Although numerically biased
towards the pterygote orders, hexapod mtDNA data have
been enriched recently with entries from the more basal
lineages (apterygote), a possible consequence of the growing interest in phylogenetic studies of insects and relatives
for the analysis of genome-level data sets [5-9]. At present,
10 complete (or almost complete) mtDNA sequences
have been determined for collembolan (springtail) species, although detailed descriptions and analysis have
been provided only for a minority. The "basic" arrangement of the 37 mitochondrial genes found in collembolan species generally resembles that usually considered
ancestral for Pancrustacea [8,10]. However, rearrangements of tRNA genes and/or molecular traces of duplication events appear to be more common than expected.
Focusing on Antarctic organisms, a remarkable feature,
the loss of nad6, has been reported for notothenioid
fishes; this unusual rearrangement has been tentatively
associated with heat production due to proton leakage, as
a possible physiological adaptation to cold environments
[11].
Collembola have been described as model organisms in
Antarctic terrestrial ecosystem studies, on account of the
extent of existing biochemical and ecophysiological
research, and their dominant role in Antarctic terrestrial
ecosystems [12]. In this study we describe the complete
mitochondrial genome of the Antarctic collembolan
Cryptopygus antarcticus, the first example from the family
Isotomidae and only the second (after Gomphiocephalus
hodgsoni; [5]) for an Antarctic species. Recently, molecular

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/315

phylogeographic studies based on mitochondrial haplotypes have contributed to the understanding of the evolutionary origins of species of the genus Cryptopygus [13].
Mitogenomics data for C. antarcticus will further contribute to studies of the patterns of distribution and the processes of colonization of the Antarctic collembolan fauna,
a subject of particular recent interest in the context of Antarctic phylogeography, carrying signals over multimillion
year timescales [14,15].

Results and Discussion
Gene content and genome organization
The mitochondrial genome of C. antarcticus is a closed circular molecule of 15,297 bp and contains the set of 37
genes usually found in metazoans [16] (Figure 1; GenBank accession number: EU016194). The gene order is
identical to Drosophila yakuba [17], and reflects the presumed ancestral condition for Pancrustacea. The majority
of genes are located on the plus or J-strand, the remainder
having opposite polarity and being oriented on the minus
or N-strand (Figure 1 & Table 1). There are four major
non-coding regions of 622, 123, 60 and 33 bp in length
that are located at the gene junctions rrnS/trnI, trnS(uga)/
cob, nad6/cob and trnE/trnF, respectively. The largest noncoding region most likely corresponds to the region (A+Trich region in insects) where in other hexapods the
sequences responsible for the initiation of transcription
and replication of the entire genome are found [1].
Gene initiation and termination
Canonical initiation codons (ATA or ATG), encoding the
amino acid methionine, are used in 9 PCGs (atp8, cob,
cox1, cox3, nad2–5 and nad4L), whereas four other genes
start with non-standard codons (atp6, cox2, nad1 and
nad6) (Table 1) as it often happens in animal mtDNAs
[18]. Only five PCGs terminate with the complete termination codon TAA (atp8, atp6, cox3, nad4L and nad6). In
all other cases, stop codons are truncated (T or TA) and
their functionality probably recovered after a post-transcriptional polyadenilation [19]. These abbreviated stop
codons are found in PCGs that are followed by a downstream tRNA gene, suggesting that the secondary structure
information of the tRNA genes could be responsible for
the correct cleavage of the polycistronic transcript. It is
noteworthy that in all cases an additional complete stop
codon is present a few bases downstream of the incomplete stop codon, as if a short overlap would be necessary
to stop the RNA polymerase in case translation should
begin before mRNA cleavage [3,20]. tRNA genes are usually interspersed among protein coding genes, their secondary structure acting as a signal for the cleavage of the
polycistronic primary transcript [19,22]. However, there
are also direct junctions between two PCGs (atp8/atp6,
atp6/cox3, nad6/cob and nad4L/nad4) where other cleavage
signals, different from tRNA gene secondary structures,

may be involved in the processing of the polycistronic primary transcript [23]. In this respect, hairpin structures, frequently observed at the 3'-end of a PCG abutting the 5'end of a neighbouring one, may serve as signal to direct
immature mRNA cleavage [24-26]. Experimental analyses
of cDNA pools have demonstrated that some mtDNA
genes (i.e.: atp8/atp6 and nad4L/nad4) are recovered as
bicistronic units in human HeLa cells [21] and in the dipteran Anopheles funestus [25]. In the C. antarcticus mtDNA,
with the single exception of cox3, a complete stop codon
(TAA) is only present when two PCGs abutt directly
(Table 1). The gene pair nad4L/nad4 is composed of a single in-frame coding unit (the two genes are separated by 6
nucleotides), whereas atp8 and atp6 overlap (7 nucleotides) as is almost universally found in metazoans [25].

Transfer RNAs
All the 22 tRNA genes typically found in metazoan mtDNAs were identified according to their secondary structure
and primary sequence of the corresponding anticodon
(Figure 2). The only peculiar feature is represented by an
additional (and apparently non-functional) copy of the
tRNA gene for the amino acid leucine (trnL(uag)P), that is
located within a non-coding spacer (123 bp) between
trnS(uga) and nad1 (Figure 1). This tRNA pseudogene may
represent the degenerating vestige of a duplication event
that occurred in collembolan mtDNA early in the evolution of the group, given that in the same position a similar
spacer is also present in G. hodgsoni [5] (50 bp) and Podura
aquatica [8] (150 bp). Other unusual features are the lack
of the DHU arm in trnS(gcu) and the reduction of the TΨC

models of holometabolan insects [30], and we therefore
made no attempt to reconstruct the structure of the rrnS
and rrnL rRNA here.

arm in trnG and trnV . Moreover, some tRNA genes have
few mismatches in the acceptor and/or the discriminator
arms (trnR, trnD, trnC, trnE, trnQ, trnH, trnL(uaa), trnLuag, trnK, trnS(gcu) and trnW). In similar cases (in metazoans but more commonly in plants and Protozoa) base
pairing is restored post- or co-transcriptionally with an
RNA-editing mechanism [27,28]. Overlaps between tRNA
genes were not frequent (4 instances) and then limited to
1 or 2 bases (Table 1).
Ribosomal RNAs
The putative secondary structures of the complete small
and large ribosomal subunits (rrnS and rrnL) have been
reconstructed for a limited number of insect species, and
detailed studies are essentially available only for Drosophila virilis, D. melanogaster [29] and Apis mellifera [30].
Within basal hexapod groups, the architectures of the
ribosomal subunits have been tentatively reconstructed
only for the two species Campodea fragilis and C. lubbocki
[31], and a more detailed analysis has been performed
only for domain III of the small RNA subunit of several
Arthropleona species [32]. Additional comparative analyses in basal hexapod lineages are required to allow an
accurate comparison with current secondary structure

A+T-rich region
Previous analyses of the Drosophila A+T-rich region identified the signals responsible for the origin of replication of
the major and minor strands (OJ and ON, respectively)
and confirmed that, at least in this genus, the mtDNA replicates with a strand-asynchronous, asymmetric mechanism [1]. Mapping of OJ and ON in Drosophila and other
insect A+T-rich regions has recently allowed the definition
of primary sequences and secondary structure elements
involved in the initiation of the replication process [1,3336]. In holometabolan insects, two distinct thymine
stretches, one located near trnI on the N-strand and
another in the center of the A+T-rich region on the Jstrand, appear to be responsible for OJ and ON replication,
respectively. Similarly, a thymine stretch plays an essential
role in the initiation of the replication system of the Light
strand (OL) in mammals (although in this case the two OR
are separated by 2/3 of the genome), and is also believed
to be involved in protein binding and primer RNA synthesis. Nevertheless, the conservation of thymine stretches
among insects appears to be a peculiarity of more derived
orders, with alternative sequences probably responsible
for OR in basal hexapod lineages [1].

The A+T-rich region of C. antarcticus is 622 bp; it shows six
"TA" tandem repeats of variable length (from 5 to 7 units)
and a low similarity in primary sequence with other collembolan specimens. The identification of sequences
homologous to those observed in holometabolan insects
involved in OR was not completely successful in defining
potential regulatory elements. In this respect, four thymine stretches of variable size (4 to 6) could be observed on
the N-strand, within 100 bp of trnI, but none of them
appears to correspond, in terms of size and position, to
that observed in Drosophila. In addition, in agreement
with previous reports [1] there is no thymine stretch
longer than 6 bp on this strand. Conversely, in the C. antarcticus J-strand, a longer thymine stretch (14 bp) is
present between nucleotides 14996 and 15009 and this
appears to be assimilable (both in primary sequence and
position) to the one observed in the central portion of the
Drosophila A+T-rich region. Similarly to Drosophila, this
portion of the C. antarcticus A+T-rich region may also act
as the ON, given that the motif "ACTATTT", frequently
present in Drosophila (in 8/12 different species; see: Figure
6, in [1]), is found 11 bp downstream of the 14-bp thymine stretch. If this evidence is confirmed by additional
data on basal hexapod mtDNA sequences, the role of conserved primary sequence stretches in the initiation of the
replication mechanism might be confirmed as a common
feature of all hexapod groups (at least for the N-strand),

from the most basal to the most derived lineages. The
presence of hypothetical secondary structures involved in
the initiation of the origin of replication process of the C.
antarcticus mtDNA is difficult to establish. In this species
the entire A+T-rich region can be folded in several paired
structures, and additional comparative studies will be
needed to clarify their role.
Non-coding regions
Unlike those of plants, animal mitochondrial genomes
are very compact, with a high proportion of coding vs
non-coding sequences [16,37]. Intergenic spacers are usually limited in number and size, and their occurrence is
believed to be the result of errors of the mtDNA replication system (i.e. duplication of parts of the mitochondrial
genomes, with redundant copies becoming pseudogenes
and disappearing). Apart from the A+T-rich region, the
largest (123 bp) non-coding sequence of the C. antarcticus
mtDNA is located between trnS(uga) and nad1. Within
this region, an additional copy of trnL(uag) (Figures. 1
and 2) can be identified. Given that a functional copy of
this gene is present in its canonical position between nad1
and rrnL genes (as in other arthropod mtDNAs), and that
there are several mismatches in the acceptor arm that
might compromise the correct folding into a typical cloverleaf structure, we believe that trnL(uag)P may represent
the molecular trace of an older duplication event that
occurred during the evolution of this species (there are
also alternative interpretations, see below). It is noteworthy that this genomic region is also subject to molecular
rearrangments in other collembolan species (i.e. one
tRNA translocation in Tetrodontophora bielanensis and Onychiurus orientalis) or shows intergenic spacers similar to
those observed in C. antarcticus (i.e. 48 bp in G. hodgsoni).
This observation suggests that the DNA fragment encompassing cob and nad1 may represent a "hot spot" for rearrangements in the collembolan mitochondrial genome,
and that either several taxa have independently undergone rearrangements or these have occurred before the
differentiation of the major collembolan lineages.

It is well known that tRNA genes are more prone to translocations than protein coding genes, with "hot spots" of
rearrangement being described in some lineages [38,39].
In the case of the collembolan mtDNA, we speculate that
a replication error (probably due to slipped strand mispairing) may have generated an intermediate state with at
least a duplicated copy of the trnL(uag) gene. Afterwards,
the superfluous copy(ies) may have been transformed
into a pseudogene, whereas the original copy could have
conserved its functionality (therefore leading to no
changes in the gene order). Presently, it is only possible to
conclude that: 1) similar (for size and position) intergenic
spacers have been also found in two species of the genus
Campodea (Diplura [31]), another basal hexapod group

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/315

probably as primitive as Collembola; 2) the gene junction
trnS(uga)/nad1 corresponds to the shift of the coding
polarity between two blocks of genes (nad6-cob-trnS(uga)
oriented on the J-strand, and nad1-trnL(uag)-rrnL-trnVrrnS on the N-strand). Interestingly, experiments conducted on transcriptional termination factors in D. melanogaster have identified the positions of some binding
sites that are responsible for the control of multiple transcription units on the mtDNA of this species [40]. One of
the most interesting results of these studies is that, unlike
human, and along with sea urchin mtDNA [41-44], in
Drosophila one of these terminator sites is not located at
the 3'-end of the ribosomal genes. Conversely, two
stretches of non-coding sequence would correspond to
the binding sites for the Drosophila mitochondrial transcription termination factor (DmTTF), a nuclear-encoded
protein involved in the processes of attenuation and/or
termination of mRNA transcripts [40]. Intriguingly, the
short stretches of non-coding sequences identified in Drosophila as DmTTF binding sites are located at the gene
junctions trnE/trnF and trnS(uga)/nad1, in the same positions where C. antarcticus shows intergenic spacers (Table
1). Not only their position is identical, but also these
sequences are located in a position of abrupt shift in the
transcription polarity of the mtDNA genes (a suitable
position for an attenuator/terminator of mRNA synthesis). Nevertheless, the non-coding regions of Drosophila
and C. antarcticus, show no discernible sign of homology,
leaving open the question of whether they do play the
same role. It should be noted, however, the signalling role
may be played by secondary structure motifs, like those
observed between trnS(uga) and nad1 in Collembola and
Diplura mtDNAs, rather than primary sequence.
Repeats and palindromic sequences
Two perfect palindromic sequences were observed. One is
38 bp long and spans the junction between the nad2 and
trnW (positions 1196–1233). The second is 18 bp long
and lies 42 bp from the 3'end of rrnS (14033–14050).

Three repeated sequences were found in different areas of
the genome. One is 22 bp long and encompasses the initial part of both trnL(uaa) and trnL(uag) (note that these
latter genes are oriented on opposite strands), from base 3
to base 24 (with one mismatch). Interestingly, although
duplication and remolding events of leucine tRNA genes
have probably occurred independently several times
within some major animal lineages [45], the observed 22
bp-long fragment is highly conserved in all collembolan
species investigated (data not shown) suggesting that primary sequence and precise conformation of this region is
important for the building of both tRNA genes and/or for
their interaction with the ribosomal complex.

A second perfect direct repeated sequence, 18 bp long, is
observed at 105 bp from the 3'-end of rrnS (14096–
14113), and at 7 bp from the 3'-end of nad6 (10309–
10327). A partially overlapping sequence of 17 bp is also
repeated in inverted orientation in the middle of the A+Trich region.
Base composition and codon usage
The mtDNA of many arthropod lineages is characterized
by a strong compositional bias showing high values of A%
and T% vs. G% and C%. This trend in nucleotide composition (A+T bias) is remarkable in some insect groups (i.e.
holometabolan orders) and, to a lesser extent, is also
apparent in the more basal hexapod lineages [31]. The C.
antarcticus mtDNA is 70.9% A+T-rich, and therefore in the
range observed for other collembolan species (A+T contents spanning from 65.5% to 74.1%) [5,8]. The observed
A+T content strongly influences the use of two- and fourfold degenerate synonymous sites in protein coding
genes, with relaxed pressure probably responsible for the
most frequent use of NNA and NNU codons (Table 2).

Another remarkable molecular feature of metazoan mtDNAs is the asymmetry in the composition of the nucleotide content between the two strands [46]. Usually, A%
and C% are higher than T% and G% on the J-strand
(appropriately named plus strand because of its positive
AT and CG skew), whereas the reverse is observed in the
N-strand (hence named minus strand). Asymmetry in
nucleotide composition among strands may be due to the
peculiar replication and transcription mechanisms [47].
In mammals, it has been demonstrated that the duplication of the mitochondrial genome (usually defined as the
'strand-displacement' or 'leading and lagging' model) is
asynchronous and requires extensive displacement of the
H strand, that therefore transiently is found in a singlestrand state ([48]; but see also alternative views in [49]).
The longer the time this strand is unpaired during replication (DSSH), the more pronounced is the compositional
asymmetry between H and L strands [50]. In the few cases
where mtDNA replication has been studied in insects
(essentially Drosophila), the mechanism is also "more
asynchronous" given that both origins of replication (ON
and OJ) are located in the A+T-rich region (rather than at
3/4 of the genome, as in the strand-displacement model
of replication) [1], and synthesis of the major coding
strand begins after 97% of the minor strand has been replicated [1,2,51]. Being the N-strand, during its singlestranded status, more prone to deaminations than double
stranded DNA, A→G and C→U transitions are more likely
to occurr. This mutational pressure generates inequalities
in the nucleotide composition between the two strands
with positive AT-skew and CG-skew values resulting on
the J-strand [20,47].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/315

Remarkable strand compositional biases have been previously observed in the mtDNA of some basal hexapod lineages [31,47,52]. In the J-strand of the C. antarcticus
cytosines are always more frequent than guanines, leading
to a positive CG-skew (0.148). Conversely, the AT-skew is
only moderately positive, as calculated over the entire
genome (0.058) and in III codon positions of the J-strand
PCGs (0.048), or negative, as calculated over entire PCGs
(-0.082 and -0.27 for protein coding genes oriented on
the J-strand and N-strand, respectively). On the other
hand, remarkable negative values of AT and CG skew are
observed on the N-strand (AT-skew = -0.27 and CG-skew
= -0.193, for all PCGs positions; AT-skew = -0.227 and
CG-skew = -0.189, for 3rd positions only). This latter bias
may be due to the high frequency of mutational events
leading to deamination of A and G nucleotides of the displaced N-strand, occurring during the replication of
mtDNA. Different rates of transitions (A→G < C→U;
[44]) may have eventually led to the asymmetry (negative
AT and CG skews) of nucleotide composition and to the
higher T% vs A% of PCGs oriented on the N-strand.
In this respect, the frequency of adenines and thymines is
approximately equal in the genes encoded on the J-strand,
whereas a higher percentage of A vs T (counting on the Jstrand) is observed in those oriented on the N-strand (Figure 3). If the strand displacement model of mtDNA replication described in mammals and Drosophila also holds
for Collembola, we can speculate that the block of genes
spanning from rrnS to trnF (all genes oriented on the Nstrand except for trnT, nad6, cob and trnS(uga); Figures 1
and 3) is more prone to the deamination type C→U than
the opposite strand (due to higher DSSH), and that transitions between C and T are more frequent than those
between A and G. Perhaps this trend, observed only in the
PCGs oriented on the N-strand, is dependent on a higher
number of mutations occurring during transcription,
rather than replication, and is consequently less etched in
the PCGs encoded on the J-strand. In addition, it has been
demonstrated that cytosine is the most unstable of the
four bases and the number of C deaminations is more
pronounced in single-strand DNAs [53].
The asymmetrical directional mutation pressure [54]
observed in the two strands strongly influences the codon
usage of PCGs oriented in opposite directions [55-57]. In
this respect, NNA and NNC codons are more frequent
than NNU and NNG in the PCGs encoded on the J-strand,
whereas the N-strand genes show exactly the opposite
trend (Figure 4). Codon usage may also be influenced by
other molecular processes such as translational selection
efficiency and accuracy [58], which apparently have a
stronger influence in organisms with rapid growth rates
[59]. In addition, recent analyses of codon usage in fourfold degenerate codons of mammal and fish mtDNAs

have demonstrated that there are context-dependent
mutational effects (correlations between pairs of neighboring bases). In this respect, the second codon position
base strongly influences the presence of a specific nucleotide at fourfold degenerate sites, and these latter are not
independent from the first-position nucleotide of the following codon [60].
Nucleotide variability of collembolan mitochondrial PCGs
The nucleotide variability of each mitochondrial PCG has
been estimated calculating gene-by-gene average values of
genetic distances (Appendix 1: dist.jpg), across all collembolan taxa for which full (or nearly complete) mtDNAs
are available (Appendix 2: list.exl). Distances values are
higher for nad2, nad3 and cob, suggesting these genes to be
the least conserved ones in the mtDNA of Collembola.
Conversely, the more conserved mitochondrial genes are
some of the cytochrome family (complexes 1 to 3) and
nad1. The distribution of the observed nucleotide variability is somewhat difficult to explain. However, according to
the proposed model of mtDNA replication mechanism
(studied for a restricted number of hexapods taxa [1]), the
genes located in the vicinity of the A+T-rich region remain
for a longer time in a single-strand state during the
mtDNA replication and therefore are more exposed to
hydrolytic and oxidative damages [50]. This interpretation could explain the high levels of divergence observed
for nad2. In addition, sites for the attenuation of the
mtDNA transcription mechanism [43] (i.e. located in the
vicinity of nad3 and cob) may also be important to
increase the mutation load for neighbour genes. Collectively, these DNA fragments are probably more prone to
higher substitution rates than the others due to their position along the mtDNA, although no experimental study
has been performed to sustain this hypothesis. Alternatively, structural constraints at the protein level may result

in site-specific selective pressures acting differently and in
a scattered manner along the mitochondrial genome, with
some genes bearing a higher mutational load than others.

Conclusion
The description and analysis of the complete mtDNA
genome sequence of C. antarcticus has led to new insights
on the mitogenomics of the group, and significantly
added to our knowledge on mitochondrial genomes from
species adapted to the Antarctic terrestrial ecosystem. Several peculiarities, such as nucleotide and strand-specific
compositional bias, the occurrence of truncated stop
codons of PCGs and the presence of mismatches and/or
incomplete tRNA arms, have been observed. However, no
distinguishing molecular features can be associated with
adaptation to the extreme polar environment. The gene
order is canonical, but two unusual and large non-coding
regions were observed in sites of abrupt shift of the coding
polarity. Such intergenic spacers may contain the regulatory signals involved in the replication and/or transcription of the mtDNA, although additional data will be
needed to better clarify their function. Segments of these
intergenic regions can apparently be folded in typical cloverleaf structures, and probably represent duplicated vestigial versions of at least one tRNA gene. This feature
seems to be shared by other collembolan mtDNAs, suggesting that the gene junction trnS(uga)/cob may represent
a "hot spot" for gene rearrangements in Collembola.

Methods

using standard protocols. Each resulting clone was
sequenced on both strands in a CEQ 8000XL automated
DNA Analysis System (Beckman Coulter). Eventually,
regions of "unsatisfactory coverage" and small gaps in the
sequences have been amplified and sequenced using
standards protocols and different Long-PCR amplifications as template. Sequences were manually corrected and
assembled with the software Sequencher 4.4.2 (Gene
Codes). Long-PCR products were composed with those
initially generated for short fragments to provide the complete genome sequence. Hence, the final assemblies were
based on a minimum sequence coverage of 5×, that is the
results of a pool of individuals, although only for a very
short portion of the molecule (essentially limited to small
fragments of cox1/cox2 and cob, given the supposed conservation of the amplified region of the rrnL). Screening of
nucleotide sequences, obtained from specimens of the
same locality, provides no extreme variability (essentially
limited to the 3rd codon positions) for either cox1/cox2
and cob fragments (data not shown).
Gene annotation and analysis
Genes encoding proteins, rRNAs and tRNAs were identified according to their amino acid translation or secondary structure features, respectively. Individual gene
sequences were compared with the homologous sequence
of other collembolan species available in GenBank and
inspected for the presence of gene overlaps, non-canonical start codons and truncated termination codons, and
unusual structures at gene junctions. The secondary structure of tRNA genes was manually reconstructed and rendered using the software Rna Viz 2.0 [62]. Nucleotide
variability of collembolan mtDNA (see Additional file 1:
dist.jpg) was assessed using thirteen alignments of the
PCGs. Basic sequence statistics and genetic distances
among collembolan genes were calculated using PAUP*
4b8 [63] (see Additional file 2: list.xls), whereas codon
usage and RSCU values were calculated using codonw
[64]. Strand asymmetry was measured using the formulas
AT-skew = [A%-T%]/[A%+T%] and CG-skew = [C%-G%]/
[C%+G%] [46,47]. The presence of repeated sequences
within non-coding fragments was studied using the mreps
software [65]. The presence of additional repeats and palindromic sequences was investigated using Blast, and hits
with e-value < 0,05 were retained for further analysis.

Graphical representation of the average nucleotide genetic distances calculated for every PCGs (y-axis) among the nine collembolan species (but,
ten sequences) for which is available a complete (or almost complete)
mtDNA. Genetic distances were calculated from 13 independent alignments (performed adjusting preliminary automated alignments obtained
using the software RevTrans [66]). The proportion of unalignable (green)
positions for each gene-based alignment (left side of x-axis) is depicted.
Genetic distances (right side of x-axis) were calculated under the Maximum Likelihood method. Model selection was performed gene-by-gene
using an identical tree adapted after [9]. The GTR+I+Γ always resulted
as the best fitting model (plus parameters used to accommodate rate heterogeneity among sites), with the only exception of atp8 (HKY+I+Γ).
Note that the proportion of the alignable sites for this latter gene is very
low (57/189), so that in this case the high average values of genetic distances (*) can not be considered reliable, likewise to previous analysis of
vertebrate mitochondrial genomes that also described the atp8 as the fastest-evolving mtDNA gene [50].
