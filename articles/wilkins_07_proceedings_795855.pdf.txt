Introduction
The Fourth Annual MidSouth Computational Biology and
Bioinformatics Society (MCBIOS-IV) conference was held
in New Orleans, Louisiana on February 1st–3rd, 2007. The
conference venue included two locations: the Lindy Boggs
Conference facility at the University of New Orleans
(UNO); and Dinner/Speaker venues in the French Quarter
– Broussard's of New Orleans and The House of Blues. The
conference featured three days of technical presentations,
with the third day partly devoted to a satellite Conference
on Nanopore Cheminformatics with an on-site demo
presentation of a nanopore detector (from the Research
Institute for Children and UNO Nanopore Cheminformatics/Biophysics Labs). The theme of this year's conference was "Computational Frontiers in Biomedicine".
At MCBIOS 2007, awards for outstanding poster presentations were given to the following students: In Poster Session I, 1st place went to 1st: Mutlu Mete of UALR, 2nd place
to William Sanders of MSU and 3rd place to Stephanie
Byrum of the UALR. In Poster Session II, 1st place went to
Matthew Landry of UNO, 2nd place to Terra Colvin, Jr. of
UALR, and 3rd place to Iftekhar Amin of UNO. 1st place

for outstanding oral presentation went to Vijayaraj Nagarajan of USM.

Proceedings summary
This year, 24 out of 31 submitted papers were accepted for
inclusion in the proceedings (77%), similar to the
number published in last year's Proceedings [1-21]. Each
of the papers was peer-reviewed by at least two members
of the program committee members and/or external
experts in the field. Our goal, as in past years, has been to
be inclusive yet rigorous in selecting only high-quality
papers. The general themes of this year's proceedings
papers fall into several categories:

Systems biology
One of the most important challenges of current miRNA
research is to decipher the "code" of miRNA regulation –
to find the connection between miRNA expression and
phenotypic changes. Gusev et al [22] report the results of
a systems biology based analysis of aberrantly expressed
miRNAs in five human cancers. Their findings suggest that
co-expressed miRNAs collectively provide a systemic compensatory response to the abnormal phenotypic changes

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8(Suppl 7):S1

in cancer cells by targeting a broad range of functional categories and signaling pathways affected in a particular
cancer.
One of the things evident from the Gusev et al study is that
there is a large body of microarray data that is becoming
available for analysis. As such, methods to begin inferring
regulatory networks from this data are important. In
another paper, Peng Li et al compare probabilistic
Boolean Network (PBNs) and Dynamic Bayesian Network
(DBNs) approaches to correctly inferring regulatory networks [24]. They find that PBNs can reduce the computational complexity, false positive and false negative errors
significantly, while DBNs can more accurately derive
genetic network interactions, but are more time-consuming.
While microarray technology is steadily improving, it still
suffers from noise; hence experiments are repeated several
times to reduce error. To reduce the amount of replication
necessary, Dozmorov et al [23] used F-tests against system-level noise to identify hypervariable genes from timecourse microarray experiments. This novel systems-biology approach to biological network reconstruction investigated urothelial cell response to infection with
Enterococcus bacteria. A complex response was mapped
out involving cytoskeletal rearrangement, immune
response, modulation of growth and cellular metabolism,
and Wnt signaling, as well as responses heretofore unrecognized because they involve poorly annotated genes.

[27] use artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict
which proteolytic peptides generated by a protein dataset
are likely to be detectable by mass spectrometry. The result
is an improved method for calculating protein coverage in
proteomics experiments and a mechanism for determining if proteins in specific pathways under study are likely
to be detected by mass spectrometry.
Bridges et al [28] develop & describe a system, ProtQuant,
to provide relative quantification of proteins in highthroughput proteomics samples (MudPIT) using labelfree quantification. ProtQuant differs from existing labelfree approaches in that it extrapolates the values of missing data points, where possible, from below-threshold
identifications. The Java-based tool has a graphical user
interface and accepts multiple file formats.

Cheminformatics
Four papers explore a new transduction-based nanopore
detector mechanism. The first [29] introduces the transduction detection method and shows results indicating
the applicability to examination of binding in individual
molecular complexes in very general circumstances. The
next [30] applies this method to the examination of binding for two DNA-protein binding interactions: (1) TBP –
TATA receptor binding, and (2) HIV Integrase – HIV DNA
Terminus binding. The method is also effective at detecting DNA-DNA binding interactions that occur with
annealing of DNA single-strand overhangs [31] as well as
protein-protein binding interactions for the medically
important case of antibody-antigen interactions [32].

OMICS
Biological analysis spans several different areas from the
genome/proteome to the metabolome, collectively
referred to as "omics" for the study of different biological
bodies. In one study, Schnackenberg et al [25] study agerelated differences in Sprague-Dawley rats by examining
changes in metabolite concentrations in their urine by
NMR and UPLC/MS. Their findings are in line with the
free-radical theories of aging, as they find a higher concentration of oxidized antioxidants in older rats. They also
examine the effects of data normalization procedures and
the impact on statistical analyses.
Nagarajan and Elasri [26] use bioinformatics approaches
to predict the structure and function of Msa, a novel gene
in the human pathogen S. aureus. Their combination of
methods suggests that Msa is membrane-bound with sites
for phosphorylation and protein-binding, suggesting it
plays a role in signal transduction, which is consistent
with its known activity as a modulator of the protein SarA.
Not all peptide fragments are represented equally in mass
spectrometry (MS) experiments. To help predict which
peptides might be lost or underrepresented, Sanders et al.

Machine learning based pattern recognition
Pattern recognition is a critical part of making sense of the
high-throughput data gathered in modern biomedical
experiments. Four papers explore the development of
machine learning based pattern recognition methods and
their application to resolving complex nanopore-transduction detector signals. The first [33] describes a new
Support Vector Machine (SVM) based method for clustering (unsupervised learning) – a marked departure from
the standard supervised-learning approach to SVMs. The
author's objective was to have a powerful, non-parametric, method for phase tracking on nanopore transduction
signals, a key requirement for extracting binding kinetics
from channel current signals. They also describe a new
form of Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that has the
strengths of the much more complex HMM-with-Duration (HMMwD) models, but at a computational cost
approximating the simpler HMM [34]. The goal is to
apply this method in a real-time pattern recognition
informed sampling process on the nanopore detector. The
third paper, [35], examines learning on exact HMMwD
models and their use in two-state signal decomposition.
The fourth paper, [36], explores (i) non-standard HMM

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8(Suppl 7):S1

implementations for improved feature extraction and
SVM classification performance, (ii) SVM classification
improvements resulting from introduction of a single
"spike density" feature; and (iii) SVM improvements
resulting from introducing a huge family of HMM transition probability features subsequently pruned by an AdaBoost Selection process.

Microarray studies
Rather than focus on refinement of methods, several
authors report the effectiveness and utility of existing bioinformatics approaches to better understand a biological
system. For example, Nan Mei et al [37] studied gene
expression changes in the livers of riddelline-treated Big
Blue rats. Standard analysis methods and popular pathway analysis software was used to determine that the
genes differentially expressed with significance were
mainly involved in cancer, tissue development, apoptosis,
cellular growth and proliferation, and others. The study
helped elucidate the mechanisms involved in toxicity and
carcinogenesis due to exposure to riddelline.
Guo et al. [38] used microarrays in conjunction with pathway analysis software to test the hypothesis that Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs), common in many plants, cause
liver toxicity and/or cancer in experimental animals. They
found that genes within carcinogenic pathways were disproportionately altered, supporting their hypothesis.
Circadian rhythms are generally associated with the sleep/
wake cycle, but also regulate many activities and affect the
expression pattern of practically all genes. Time-course
microarrays can potentially detect this baseline oscillation, which Ptitsyn and Gimble [39] use in an interesting
study on the leptin signaling system. This system is a
major regulator of energy metabolism, responsible to the
sensation of satiety after a meal. They observe tissue-specific alternative polyadenylation of SOCS3 transcripts,
whereby alternative transcripts different by the length of a
3' UTR oscillate in counter-phase. This study suggests a
mechanism that can provide a constant abundance of
transcript and volume of cytokine signal transduction
regardless of circadian time.

Genomic analysis
Identification of DNA binding sites for transcription factors (motifs) is important for a complete understanding of
co-regulation of gene expression, but has proven to be
quite challenging. Das and Dai [40] review previously
published algorithms for DNA motif finding. The algorithms reviewed are string-based, probabilistic, and
machine learning techniques that fall into three major
classes: Those that use promoter sequences of co-regulated genes from single genome, phylogenetic footprinting, and a hybrid of the two. Although there has been

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/S7/S1

substantial progress in this area within recent years and
algorithms work reasonably well for prokaryotic organisms, success with motif finding in eukaryotes has been
more elusive.
Loganantharaj et al [41] have proposed a general methodology for validating the effectiveness of phylogenetic profiling, using the Gene Ontology as the gold standard for
validating functional similarity among the genes in each
cluster. They demonstrated that phylogenetic profiling
technique showed poor performance in functional prediction in human and mouse. However, their empirical study
shows strong support for few cohesive functional groups
in each phylogenetic cluster. They concluded that phylogenetic profiling is still a very useful technique for predicting function of an unknown protein sequence.
Pirooznia et al [42] report the results of a large-scale EST
sequencing project for the earthworm, Eisenia fetida,
which is often used in toxicology studies. They describe
the sequencing and analysis of 3,144 new ESTs.

Miscellaneous
The insertion of new or altered genes into genomes is a
key step in many functional analysis studies, and it is
important to determine how many copies of each of these
transgenes are present. Yuan et al [43] report the development of a new statistical approach that facilitates a more
accurate transgene copy number estimation.
Ding et al [44] propose a new algorithm for divisive clustering, which is similar to bisecting k-median, but which
uses statistical spatial depth to identify the "center" of a
cluster. A new subcluster selection rule, Relative Average
Depth, is also introduced. In data sets that are noisy or
have high dimension and low sample size, which is common in gene expression data sets, the bisecting k-spatial
median algorithm does well compared to the componentwise bisecting k-median algorithm.
Cancer diagnosis usually begins with histopathological
examinations of tissue biopsies. These evaluations are
usually somewhat subjective and the growing number of
such images has provides an opportunity to test automated approaches to tissue sample categorization. Mete et
al [45] report a method for automated analysis of squamous cell carcinomas using a SVM. They report a classification accuracy of 96% on their test set, which is quite
promising for the future of histopathology.
