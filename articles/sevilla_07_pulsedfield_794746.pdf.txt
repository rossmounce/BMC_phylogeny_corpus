Abstract
Background: Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Map) causes paratuberculosis in
animals and is suspected of causing Crohn's Disease in humans. Characterization of strains led to
classify paratuberculosis isolates in two main types, cattle type strains, found affecting all host
species, and sheep type strains, reported affecting mainly sheep. In order to get a better
understanding of the epidemiology of paratuberculosis a large set of Map isolates obtained from
different species over the last 25 years have been characterized. Five-hundred and twenty isolates
from different hosts (cattle, sheep, goats, bison, deer and wild boar) and origins had been cultured
and typed by IS1311 restriction-endonuclease-analysis. Two-hundred and sixty-nine isolates were
further characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) using SnaBI and SpeI
endonucleases. Differences in strain isolation upon various media conditions were also studied.
Results: All bovines, 4 and 26% of Spanish sheep and goats, respectively, and the deer and wild
boar studied, carried IS1311-Cattle type strains. IS1311-Sheep type encompassed 96% and 74% of
Spanish sheep and goats, and all three Portuguese sheep. Thirty-seven distinct multiplex PFGE
profiles were found, giving 32 novel profiles. Profiles 2-1 and 1-1 accounted for the 85% of cattle
isolates. Ten distinct profiles were detected in Spanish sheep, none of them with an incidence
higher than 25%. Profile 16-11 (43%) and another three profiles were identified in Spanish caprine
cultures. The hierarchical analysis, clustered all profiles found in cattle, "wild" hosts and some small
ruminants within the same group. The other group included 11 profiles only found in Spanish sheep
and goats, including Spanish pigmented profiles. Differences in growth requirements associated
with isolate genotype were observed.
Conclusion: Cattle in Spain are infected with cattle type strains, while sheep and goats are mainly
infected with sheep type strains. Although 7H9 broth based culture media seem to broadly cover
the growth requirements of most Map strains, the use of various solid media is recommended to
reduce any recovery biases. High genetic homogeneity of isolates from cattle, and heterogeneity of
those from sheep and goats have been detected.

Background
Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Map) is an
obligate pathogen causing paratuberculosis in ruminants
and other animal species, and suspected of being responsible for Crohn's Disease in humans. Paratuberculosis
causes significant economic losses to farmers and is
becoming prevalent among livestock populations worldwide [1]. Strategies for paratuberculosis prevention and
control require an understanding of the epidemiology of
the disease. In particular, strain genotyping is a valuable
tool for epidemiological tracing of pathogenic microorganisms.
Map isolates are generally identified by acid fast staining,
the size of the bacilli, extremely slow growth, dependence
on mycobactin, and the presence of several copies of the
IS900 element in its genome. However, the description of
some Map strains that are not dependent on mycobactin
[2,3] and the presence of IS900-like insertion sequences in
bacteria other than Map [3-6] mean that more reliable
methods of characterization would be valuable. The most
commonly used typing method is the analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphism using IS900 specific
probes (IS900-RFLP). IS900-RFLP classified isolates from
cattle, sheep and goats into two major groups using BstEII
endonuclease [7]. These were called sheep (S) and cattle
(C) types because of their apparent predominance in
those host species. An intermediate (I) group was also
detected in two sheep from Canada. Strains from sheep
are difficult to culture [8,9], making further strain classification difficult. BstEII-C or cattle types have been
described in cattle from New Zealand, Australia, the USA,
Denmark, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Germany, France, Morocco, the United Kingdom, Austria,
Italy, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Argentina
and Norway [7,10-19]. These RFLP types have also been
found infecting sheep from Canada, the USA, the Czech
Republic, France, Greece, Australia, Spain and the United
Kingdom [7,15-18], and goats from New Zealand, Norway, Argentina, Germany, Denmark, Italy, the United
Kingdom, Australia and the USA [7,10-12,16-18]. These
strains have also been found in cervids from New Zealand, the Czech Republic, the United Kingdom and Argentina [14,16,20-22], in lagomorphs from Scotland and the
Czech Republic [13,21], in alpaca and rhinoceros from
Australia [11] and in Czech moufflon and wild boar [21].
In contrast, the literature contains little evidence of BstEIIS strains and BstEII-I strains being as distributed in animal
species: they have been reported in sheep from Canada,
New Zealand, the Faroe Islands, South Africa, Morocco
and Australia [7,10,11,17,19,23,24], in goats from New
Zealand and the Czech Republic [7,15], cattle from the
Czech Republic [15], and deer from New Zealand and the
Czech Republic [20,21]. IS1311 PCR-restriction endonuclease analysis (REA) [25] led to the identification of S

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/18

strains in Australian and Icelandic sheep and cattle [26]
and Spanish sheep and goats [27]. A recent study based on
IS1311 PCR-REA and other two PCR methods reported
infection of Spanish goats and bullfighting cattle with S
(Type I/III) strains [28].
Another promising technique for typing this parasitic bacterium is pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of digested
genomic DNA (PFGE). It has been useful for typing other
important mycobacteria including M. avium and M. tuberculosis [29-33]. Pigmented and non-pigmented isolates
from a wide variety of hosts and origins were analyzed by
SnaBI-SpeI PFGE in an effort to standardize the technique
for paratuberculosis strain typing [34]. Subsequently,
caprine isolates from Spain, Scotland and Norway were
analyzed [35]. Thus, 26 multiplex profiles have been
described and clustered into 3 major types. Other genotyping techniques have been investigated in an attempt to
improve upon the discriminatory power of RFLP and
PFGE [36-40]. However, some of them do not provide
enough additional information and others need to be validated with larger numbers of strains already characterized by RFLP and/or PFGE and from diverse host and
geographic origins to assess their value for further epidemiological studies on paratuberculosis.
There have been few studies reporting molecular characterization of Spanish paratuberculosis isolates [27,28,35].
Our aim in this work was to characterize by IS1311 PCRREA and PFGE typing a large set of Map isolates obtained
at Neiker from different species over the last 25 years to
serve as a basis for a better understanding of the epidemiology of paratuberculosis.

Results
All bovine isolates grew in 2–4 months on HEY, and some
cultured after 2002 also grew on LJ or in 7H11 with mycobactin J. Ovine isolates grew in 3–7 months on LJ, 7H11
(with or without mycobactin J) and/or 7H9 (with or without mycobactin J), but only from tissue samples. None of
the ovine samples used to inoculate HEY produced Map
colonies. Goat isolates grew in 2–7 months on the same
media as sheep isolates, and some of them were also successfully isolated on HEY. Mycobacterial cells were not
successfully propagated from several cases in small ruminants, although the presence of Map was identified on the
basis of acid fastness, IS900 and locus 251 PCR results,
and IS1311 PCR-REA result. Indian isolates grew in 2–4
months on HEY with no added pyruvate. Deer isolates
grew in 3 months on HEY and LJ, and wild boar isolates
grew in 2–3 months on HEY and 7H11 with mycobactin
J. The isolation media for cultures typed by PFGE are given
in Table 1. Subcultures in liquid medium of C and B
strains grew faster than those of S strains (data not
shown).

IS900 PCR and Locus 251 PCR
PCR amplification detected both IS900 and Locus 251 in
all 520 isolates used in the study. These findings and the
phenotypic characteristics (see "materials and methods"
section) allowed all bacterial isolates used to be identified
as Map.
IS1311 PCR-REA
The IS1311 insertion sequence was successfully amplified
from all isolates. Restriction analysis of amplicons
assigned each isolate to one of the 3 strain types previously described by this method. All bovine isolates, as
well as the deer and wild boar isolates, exhibited band
patterns corresponding to C type strains (Table 2). In contrast, 96.3% and 73.7% of Spanish sheep and goats,
respectively, gave isolates with banding patterns corresponding to the S type strains; all sheep isolates from Portugal were also classified in this group. The other Spanish
sheep (3.7%) and goats (26.3%) were infected by C type
strains. Interestingly, two goat flocks were infected by
both types, some goats carrying a C strain and others an S
strain. All isolates from Indian sheep and goats and from
American bison were typed as B strains.
SnaBI-SpeI PFGE analysis
Restriction endonucleases SnaBI and SpeI differentiated
26 and 24 pulsotypes, respectively (Figures 1 and 2). Thus,
a total of 37 different multiplex PFGE profiles were identified among the 269 Map isolates analyzed. Twenty-two
of the patterns identified with SnaBI (20–41) and 19 of
those obtained with SpeI (14–32) have not been described
previously; the two endonucleases together giving 32

novel PFGE multiplex profiles in our collection of isolates
(see Table 1 and Figure 3). Twenty-three different multiplex profiles were detected in Spanish cattle, 10 in Spanish
sheep and 4 in Spanish goats. Profiles 2-1 and 1-1
included 52.16 and 32.33% of cattle isolates, found in
58.02 and 30.53% of herds analyzed, respectively. The
calculated incidence for each of the other profiles identified in cattle was lower than 1%, except for profile 23-16
which included 3% of bovine isolates. In Spanish sheep,
strain type 39-17 was the most frequently found with four
isolates detected in 40% of ovine flocks. Four pigmented
sheep isolates exhibited novel restriction patterns (26-24
and 25-23), and accounted for the 23.5% of sheep isolates. The other types observed in Spanish sheep appeared
only once or twice. Profile 16-11 was found in three goats,
and profiles 2-1, 15-1 and 34-28 were identified in a single animal each. The two isolates from deer had profile
37-1, and the wild boar isolate was typed as 2-1. All the
Indian isolates gave the same multiplex profile regardless
of their host species. All bison isolates from USA were 2-1.
Several herds/flocks carried strains of different profiles: up
to 3 in 3 bovine herds and 3 sheep flocks (34 bovine
herds, 4 sheep flocks and 1 goat flocks gave more than one
isolate). Eleven bovine and one goat herds gave isolates
with two different profiles. The other flocks/herds each
gave isolates with a single multiplex pattern within the
same herd/flock. PFGE typing results according to host
species breeds are reported in Table 3.
In five cases, more than one isolate cultured from the
same animal was available. Two cows, one goat and one

deer yielded two isolates each one but the restriction patterns of isolates from the same animal were identical. In
contrast, an isolate cultured in 2002 from the feces of one
Holstein bull was of 1-1 type, whereas the two isolates cultured in 2003 from the small intestine and mesenteric
lymph nodes of the same animal, were of 2-1 and 28–30

previously and both profiles detected in pigmented isolates (25-23 and 26-24). The discriminatory power for this
PFGE strain typing method calculated as Simpson's Index
of Diversity, taking into account all isolates and profiles
described, was 0.693. The index value was 0.621 for Spanish cattle, and 0.666 for Spanish goats, but much higher,
0.865, for Spanish sheep.

Phylogenetic analysis of PFGE profiles and estimation of
genetic diversity
Phylogenetic analysis of the multiplex profiles obtained
produced a dendrogram with two main branches (Figure
3). One includes all profiles found in cattle, deer, wild
boar, Indian small ruminants and American bison, for a
total of 26 profiles. Previously described profiles 1-1, 2-1,
2–5, 2–10 and 15-1, were part of this group. The other
main branch includes 11 profiles only found in sheep and
goats from Spain, including the 16-11 profile identified

Discussion
Differences in the success of Map isolation and, more specifically, difficulties in culturing this micro-organism from
ovine specimens, have been repeatedly reported in many
countries (reviewed in reference [9]). Some authors suggest that different host species preferentially carry different strains, and the differing cultivation requirements of
these strains causes the divergent efficacy of isolating the
organism [2,7,10,41]. In contrast, other researchers did
not report any links between host species, strain type and/

or culture characteristics [16,17,34]. Our study does not
resolve this issue because we did not use the same methods for all cultures, and culture attempts were carried out
with the concrete objective of isolating Map from paratuberculosis-affected animal specimens received. Nevertheless, our results are consistent with other reports on the
comparison of different media for Map culture [9,42], and
confirm the existence of different culture requirements
according to Map type. IS1311 PCR-REA typing with our
collection of bovine isolates – presumably the least biased
due to its size and to the use of various culture media –
confirms the finding of a previous study [27]: Holstein,
Limousin and Pyrenean cattle in Spain are infected with C
type strains. These strains are more easily isolated on HEY
than on other solid media. This strain type was found only
in one of 27 isolates from Spanish sheep, the others, like
those from Portugal (n = 3) being S type. This indicates
that sheep in Spain and probably also in Portugal are
mostly infected with S strains. Some of these were isolated
with ease on 7H11 without mycobactin J, others on the
same medium with added mycobactin or on LJ with
longer incubation periods, and some grew in 7H9 culture
flasks (with or without mycobactin J). We did not obtain
any growth of such strains on HEY, but not all samples
were used to inoculate HEY slants. The single C type strain
isolated from sheep dates from 1993 and was cultured

only on LJ. Consequently, our study does not indicate
whether C strains can be readily isolated from ovine samples on HEY, but other authors report that this is feasible
[7,15]. Choy et al. [23] reported that it would appear that
the IS900-RFLP type is not correlated with the ability to
culture isolates, as uncultivable sheep isolates from intestinal-mucosal homogenates in Australia had the same pattern (S1) as those from New Zealand grown on HEY [7].
Other factors, including mycobacterial concentration,
contamination of inocula, susceptibility to hexadecylpyridinium-chloride (or other decontaminants) and/or
different phenotypic stages could also contribute to the
difficulty of culturing these strains. Only 26% of the Spanish goats analyzed were infected with strains belonging to
the C type: the other 74% had sheep (S) type paratuberculosis. The cultural characteristics of caprine isolates
depended on the strain type: C strains had bovine-like
characteristics and S strains had ovine-like characteristics.
This strain type distribution in goats disagrees with the
findings of other authors in Spain and other countries
[12,17,35] who report a very low incidence of S strains.
The proportion of S type isolates previously calculated
[28] for Spanish goats (24.7% of goat isolates and 39.1%
of flocks studied) is lower than that detected in our study
(73.7% of animals and 81.8% of flocks). These differences
may be due to a culture media bias, but epidemiological

reasons can not be ruled out. We found several goat flocks
infected with both C and S types, although this was not
the case for all farms or animal species studied. Our findings suggest that goats are highly susceptible to C, S and B
Map strains.
Although we describe numerous multiplex PFGE profiles,
nearly the 85% of bovine isolates belonged to only two
different profiles, 1-1 and 2-1. The homogeneity of
paratuberculosis isolates, especially bovine isolates, has
been described before [10-12,19,38,43]. Apparently, particular Map strains have developed the ability to infect a
wide range of types of cattle, and international trading has
favored the worldwide spread of these strains. This may be
accentuated by the genetic homogeneity of cattle as a
result of genetic improvement programs and international trading. Indeed, bovine genotypes highly susceptible to certain strains may have spread across the world,
and consequently the contact between other host species
and these strains would have increased proportionally.
We noted slight but interesting differences between strain
types found in different bovine breeds coming from the
same geographic area. Holstein cattle had the largest
number of different profiles (n = 18), but this is unsurprising because it was the most numerous breed. More
remarkable is the absence from Holsteins of 5 profiles
detected in other breeds. Limousine cattle carried more 21 type and less 1-1 type than Holstein cattle. In contrast,
the 1-1 strain was much more prevalent in Pyrenean cows.
Cattle destined to bullfighting came from a less represented geographic area. With the exception of one 2-1
type, strains isolated from these animals (n = 5) showed
rare profiles, suggesting a separate epidemiological context. This is in agreement with the results of the study by
de Juan et al. [28] reporting a high proportion of Type I/
III isolates in two bullfighting cattle farms. Type 2–10
detected in 2 bullfighting and 1 Holstein animal, has only
previously been reported in one goat from Norway [35].
The novel profile 2–25 was only isolated from two bullfighting animals. The differences of geographic origin of
isolates may contribute to the differences found between
cattle breeds, especially in bullfighting cattle.
The seven farms affected with 23-16 strains, are all in the
same geographic area, some being only 30 km apart, and
5 of them also share the same veterinarian. These strains
were isolated over several years (2000–2003) indicating
persistence in this ecosystem. According to the phylogenetic analysis, this is one of the strains more different
from the others in the bovine type sub-cluster. We are
investigating probable links in food and water resources
or historic introduction.
Ours is not the first description of mixed infection evidenced by isolation of different strains from the same ani-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/18

mal [11,15,19], and could be similar to Mycobacterium
avium polyclonal infections in human patients [44]. The
bull with 3 different strains belonged to a Holstein herd
with clinical paratuberculosis cases. The other two isolates
obtained from the herd were typed as 1-1 and 2-1. This is
consistent with types found in the bull, except for the extra
profile (28–30) which was not isolated in any other animal. Re-infection of the animal by different strain types is
the most probable explanation, because they were isolated from different biological samples and on different
sampling dates.
Strain diversity in the sheep population was high. All the
PFGE patterns of Spanish sheep isolates were different
from those found in cattle, except for one 2-1 strain from
a Rasa-Aragonesa sheep from Aragon. Pigmented isolates
exhibited novel restriction patterns designated 26-24 and
25-23. The first was found in Latxa flocks in Basque Country and Navarra. These were not related to the RasaAragonesa sheep from Aragon infected with the other pigmented profile. This is the first report of pigmented strains
in Spain. Pigmented strains were less prevalent than the
39-17 strain, found in Basque Country and Navarra. Three
flocks in neighboring locations in the main area of prevalence in sheep in Basque Country, gave 3 isolates per
flock. For each of the 3 flocks all 3 isolates differed from
each other, but 39-17 type was found in all of them.
The diversity index calculated for goats was low. However,
including goat isolates reported by de Juan et al. [35], the
index is 0.817. All isolates we cultured from goats, except
one (34-28), have profiles that have previously been
reported in this host species. The 16-11 type was observed
throughout Spain and in numerous goat breeds. We
detected the 15-1 type in goats in Cordoba (Andalucia),
and it is also detected in other breeds in Madrid. In conclusion, goats in Spain are affected with a wide range of
different strains, including C and S type strains.
Deer isolates had a novel profile (37-1) closely related to
the 15-1 type (see Figure 3), previously found in the same
area. Wild boar has carrion-eating behavior, and is a possible reservoir or vector of Map, which has been isolated
several times from this species [21,45,46]. However, there
is no evidence of diseased animals. The strain we isolated
from wild boar was 2-1 type, a strain type that is widely
disseminated. Cultures from India and bison isolates
from USA showed different multiplex profiles, indicating
they are different strains.
The phylogenetic dendrogram we constructed for our collection of paratuberculosis strains shows two distinct
branches. One comprises isolates from cattle sheep, goats,
deer, wild boar, and bison, whereas the other includes isolates only found in sheep and goats. This is in general

BMC Microbiology 2007, 7:18

agreement with previous work [34,35]. Our first branch
(isolates from cattle and other hosts) is the same as the
previously described Type II cluster, and IS900-RFLP Cattle types. The pigmented isolates from Scotland and Faroe
Islands were included in the Type I cluster. However, type
16-11 found later in Spanish goats, was not included in
Type I, and they were considered to be Type III. Our pigmented strain profiles clustered together with 16-11
strains and other isolates only found in sheep and goats.
It is not clear where these novel profiles should be incorporated, but apparently they are more closely related to
the 16-11 profile than to those previously described for
pigmented isolates. Other studies included both Sheep
and Intermediate IS900-RFLP types within the same cluster, composed of two different sub-clusters [11,16]. This
seems to be a more accurate approach because Type III
strains are very much closer to Type I than to Type II
strains. Our findings confirm the soundness of the classification proposed by de Juan et al. [28] into 2 major types
(Type I/III and Type II). These results suggest, however,
that the original classification into cattle (C) and sheep
(S) strains is more descriptive, has historic priority, and is
substantially confirmed by the associations between bacterial type and host species (Figure 4). It is also consistent
with the widely accepted practice in bacteriology of using
as species name the Latin name of the species in which the
parasite is found. Consequently, we strongly encourage
the use of this system with only two groups corresponding
to cattle and sheep.
The overall discriminatory power for this PFGE typing was
not high but acceptable (0.693). The problem with this

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/18

method appears to be the low degree of diversity of the
bovine isolates rather than a true lack of power of the typing technique. Multiplex PFGE seems to be one of the
most robust and reliable typing methods, because it
explores the entire genome and only depends on the specificity of restriction endonucleases used. Other
approaches depend on the distribution of repetitive DNA
fragments, random amplification of certain fragments or
on sequencing of variable repetitive regions; all these
approaches can suffer from problems of reproducibility or
reliability. However, PFGE is expensive and time consuming, in addition to the problem of obtaining typeable cultures. This method was unable to distinguish the IS1311B type found in bison (PFGE 2-1) from other IS1311-C
strains. The discrimination between IS1311-B and C is
important, because these B strains (from both India and
USA) share the phenotypic characteristic of preferring eggbased media without added pyruvate [27].

Conclusion
Improved liquid culture media (based on Middebrook
7H9) seem to be appropriate for primary isolation,
because they appear to provide the entire isolation
requirement spectrum of all strains. Nevertheless, we recommend the use of various solid media to avoid biases in
primary isolation, and subculture of liquid cultures (when
used for primary isolation) onto solid media to obtain
pure colonies. Alternatively, PCR-based differentiation of
strain type before culture inoculation may help to decide
the media to be used.
High homogeneity of isolates from cattle, and heterogeneity of those from sheep and goats have been detected.
Overall typing may need to be improved and this could be
done by including an additional endonuclease or complementary techniques. PCR-REA typing is a powerful technique because it can both confirm Map identity and
provide clear microbiological and epidemiological information. Systematic use of the more sophisticated PFGE
method does not seem to be of much more benefit: it provides genetic information which does not appear to be
clearly related to phenotypic properties but rather to limited epidemiologic details.

Sources and growth of isolates
Feces and tissue samples from cattle, sheep and goats were
collected for routine paratuberculosis confirmation and
for research purposes between 2000 and 2005. Twelve
samples from sheep and one from a goat date from 1984–
1999, and isolates obtained from these samples were
maintained as glycerol stocks at -80°C. Most strains were
from animals in northern regions of Spain, but strains
from other Spanish regions were also included (see Figure
5). Four-hundred and forty-four paratuberculosis isolates

BMC Microbiology 2007, 7:18

were recovered from cattle (n = 409; 178 herds), 27 from
sheep (n = 27; 15 flocks) and 21 from goats (n = 19; 11
flocks). Four of the ovine isolates were yellow pigmented
(Figure 6). Map was also cultured from one deer (2 isolates from 2 different tissue samples) and one wild boar.
Eight bovine cultures from Argentina, one from France
and 3 ovine cultures from Portugal were also included, as
well as isolates from American bison (n = 3) and Indian
sheep (n = 2) and goats (n = 8). Samples were processed
for culture of Map as described elsewhere [2]. Bovine samples were cultured on Herrold's egg yolk medium supplemented with mycobactin J (2 mg/l in all media containing
the mycobactin) (Allied Monitor, Inc., Fayette, MO, USA)
and sodium pyruvate (HEY). To avoid any bias in the
recovery of strains from cattle, additional tubes of mycobactin J-supplemented Lowënstein-Jensen medium (LJ)
were inoculated with bovine samples collected after 2002.
Some bovine samples were also used to inoculate Middlebrook 7H11 supplemented with 1% Middlebrook OADC
Enrichment (Becton, Dickinson and Company, MD, USA)
(7H11) and mycobactin J. Ovine and caprine samples
were cultured on HEY, on LJ and/or on 7H11 (alternatively with mycobactin J), depending on when they were
collected. Some of these cultures failed in the first attempt,
and material stored at -20°C was subsequently cultured
again on Middlebrook 7H9 broth supplemented with
OADC, 0.05% Tween 80 (Panreac Quimica SA, Barcelona,
Spain) (7H9) with or without added mycobactin J, and
then sub-cultured on 7H11. Indian samples were initially
grown on HEY without added pyruvate and bison samples
on LJ. Deer samples were cultured on HEY and LJ, and
wild boar samples on these two media and on 7H11 with
mycobactin J.
Cultures for PFGE
High quality DNA could not be prepared from all samples
due to loss of viability of some of the older isolates. Sufficient growth was obtained for PFGE typing with 232 isolates from cattle (n = 228; 131 herds), 17 isolates from
sheep (n = 17; 10 flocks), seven isolates from goats (n = 6;
5 flocks), two from deer, one from wild boar, three from
American bison and seven from Indian small ruminants
(two from sheep and five from goats). Nearly 85% of the
bovine isolates were from Holstein (dairy) cattle, 10%
from Limousin (beef) cows, 3% from Pyrenean (beef)
cows, and 2% from Lidia (bullfighting) cattle. Spanish
sheep were Latxa (dairy; n = 14), Rasa-Aragonesa (meat; n
= 2) and Carranzana (dairy; n = 1). Goat breeds were Payoya (dairy/meat; n = 3), Murciano-Granadina (dairy/
meat; n = 3) and Saanen (dairy; n = 1). The Indian sheep
(Muzzafarnagari) and goats (Barbari) were all meat
breeds.

ing acid fastness, and mycobactin dependence on eggbased media. Isolates were screened for the presence of
IS900 and Locus 251 [47] as follows. The method
described by Garrido et al. [48] was used to extract DNA
from single colonies or if there was no visible growth on
solid media from broth culture pellets obtained by centrifugation of 5 ml at 2000 × g for 15 min. A GeneAmp 9600
PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA)
with specific primers were used for amplification under
standardized conditions as described previously [47,48].
PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis in 2% (w/
v) agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide to
reveal DNA bands.
IS1311 PCR-REA
A segment of IS1311 element was amplified and digested
with HinfI and MseI (MseI only to rule out presence of
Mycobacterium avium subsp. avium) endonucleases as
described by Marsh et al. [25]. DNA fragments were separated by electrophoresis in 4% (w/v) agarose gels stained
with ethidium bromide. Isolates were classified as cattle
(C), sheep (S) or bison (B) Map types according to previously published criteria [25,49].
SnaBI-SpeI PFGE analysis
A protocol described previously [34] was used to prepare
mycobacterial DNA. Ten ml of 7H9 broth was inoculated
and incubated at 37°C in a static 25 cm3 cell culture flask
(Corning Inc., Corning, NY, USA). When sufficient
growth was observed at the bottom of the flask, the culPage 12 of 15

respectively. The electrophoresis time for SnaBI was 28 h
to allow rapid screening of isolates, and samples with different and/or doubtful patterns were then electrophoresed
for 40 h under the same conditions. Electrophoresis for
SpeI gels was for 23 h. The gradient applied was always 6
V/cm. DNA bands were visualized and photographed in a
Fluor-S MultiImager (BioRad) after ethidium bromide
staining. Nomenclature of novel patterns was as recommended elsewhere [34,35]. The first number refers to the
SnaBI profile and the second to the SpeI profile, giving
consecutive numbers to new profiles. Both molecular size
markers and ATCC 19698 SnaBI and SpeI profiles were
used as between-gel references for band identification.

ture was homogenized by vigorous shaking and the optical density measured using a Densimat (Bio-Mérieux,
Marcy L'Etoile, France). An appropriate volume of culture
was centrifuged at 2000 × g for 15 min, and the pellet
washed and resuspended in modified spheroplasting
buffer to obtain a bacterial suspension of approximately 6
× 109 bacteria/ml. This suspension was heated to 55°C
and mixed with an equal volume of molten 1.5% (w/v)
low-melting-point agarose (Biorad, Hemel Hempstead,
Hertfordshire, United Kingdom) in 50 mM EDTA, then
poured into plug molds (Biorad), and allowed to solidify
at 4°C. The plugs were incubated in a Tris-EDTA (10 mM
Tris-HCl and 1 mM EDTA; pH 8) lysis solution containing
1.5 mg/ml lysozyme at 37°C for 16–20 h. They were then
placed with ESP solution (0.5 M EDTA, 1% (w/v) lauryl
sarcosine and 1.5 mg/ml proteinase K) and incubated at
55°C for at least 3 days. The ESP solution was discarded
and the agarose plugs were washed in pH 8 Tris-EDTA 6
times for 20 min each. The plugs were equilibrated in the
restriction buffer supplied by the enzyme manufacturer (1
× NE buffer and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin; New
England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA, USA) and then subjected to digestion with 20 U of the appropriate endonuclease in fresh buffer at 37°C (SnaBI, 3 h; SpeI, overnight).
The plugs were placed in pH 8 Tris-EDTA and loaded into
a 1% (w/v) pulsed field certified agarose gel (Biorad).
Lambda midrange II PFG markers (New England Biolabs)
and the type strain ATCC 19698 were included in every
gel. Electrophoresis was carried out in a CHEF-DRII apparatus (BioRad). SnaBI restricted DNA was separated with
initial and final switches of 6.8 and 26.3, respectively, and
for separation of SpeI digests the values were 2.2 and 35.4,

Phylogenetic analysis of PFGE profiles and estimation of
genetic diversity
PFGE images were analyzed with the Quantity One Software package version 4.5 (BioRad). Similarities between
different multiplex profiles were calculated as Jaccard
coefficients on the basis of band presence/absence scores
with the SPSS software for Windows version 11.0 (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). An agglomerative hierarchical
cluster analysis of the data using the unweighted pair
group method with arithmetic averages was used to construct a dendrogram. Simpson's Index of Diversity was calculated as follows to compare the genetic diversity of the
isolates between host species and to asses the discriminatory power of the SnaBI-SpeI-PFGE typing: 1-[Σ(no. of isolates with a particular multiplex profile/total no. of
isolates)2]
