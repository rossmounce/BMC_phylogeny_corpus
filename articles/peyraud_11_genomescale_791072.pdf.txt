Abstract
Background: Methylotrophic microorganisms are playing a key role in biogeochemical processes - especially the
global carbon cycle - and have gained interest for biotechnological purposes. Significant progress was made in the
recent years in the biochemistry, genetics, genomics, and physiology of methylotrophic bacteria, showing that
methylotrophy is much more widespread and versatile than initially assumed. Despite such progress, system-level
description of the methylotrophic metabolism is currently lacking, and much remains to understand regarding the
network-scale organization and properties of methylotrophy, and how the methylotrophic capacity emerges from
this organization, especially in facultative organisms.
Results: In this work, we report on the integrated, system-level investigation of the metabolic network of the
facultative methylotroph Methylobacterium extorquens AM1, a valuable model of methylotrophic bacteria. The
genome-scale metabolic network of the bacterium was reconstructed and contains 1139 reactions and 977
metabolites. The sub-network operating upon methylotrophic growth was identified from both in silico and
experimental investigations, and 13C-fluxomics was applied to measure the distribution of metabolic fluxes under
such conditions. The core metabolism has a highly unusual topology, in which the unique enzymes that catalyse
the key steps of C1 assimilation are tightly connected by several, large metabolic cycles (serine cycle, ethylmalonylCoA pathway, TCA cycle, anaplerotic processes). The entire set of reactions must operate as a unique process to
achieve C1 assimilation, but was shown to be structurally fragile based on network analysis. This observation
suggests that in nature a strong pressure of selection must exist to maintain the methylotrophic capability.
Nevertheless, substantial substrate cycling could be measured within C2/C3/C4 inter-conversions, indicating that
the metabolic network is highly versatile around a flexible backbone of central reactions that allows rapid
switching to multi-carbon sources.
Conclusions: This work emphasizes that the metabolism of M. extorquens AM1 is adapted to its lifestyle not only
in terms of enzymatic equipment, but also in terms of network-level structure and regulation. It suggests that the
metabolism of the bacterium has evolved both structurally and functionally to an efficient but transitory utilization
of methanol. Besides, this work provides a basis for metabolic engineering to convert methanol into value-added
products.

Background
Methylotrophs are microorganisms able to grow on
reduced C1 compounds such as methane and methanol
as sole source of carbon and energy. Methylotrophy has
gained increasing interest over the past decade for both
basic and applied purposes, since methanol can be produced from diverse renewable sources and represents a
valuable feedstock for biotechnological applications
[1,2]. Recent progress in the biochemistry, genetics,
genomics, and physiology of methylotrophic bacteria has
shown that methylotrophy is a phenomenon much more
widespread and versatile than initially assumed [3]. The
phylogenetic distribution of methylotrophy is broad and
spans over a range of phyla and genera [3]. Methylotrophic bacteria are adapted to various lifestyles and
ecological niches (soil, water sediments, plant roots,
phyllosphere), and are involved in a number of important biological or biogeochemical processes, in particular
the global carbon cycle. Methylotrophy encompasses
diverse metabolic capabilities or behaviors that were
used to classify them, e.g. obligate vs facultative methyltrophy, heterotrophic vs autotrophic growth, aerobic vs
anaerobic metabolism. Such genetic and biochemical
diversity may explain the ecological success of methylotrophs, which can represent dominant microbial populations in specific environments, e.g. plant leaves [4].
From the biochemical point of view, methylotrophy
relies on specific pathways (C1 pathways) ensuring all
growth requirements. Energetic requirements are
enabled by dissimilation pathways, which involve a series of three basic steps: i) the oxidation of primary C1
substrates - methanol, methylamine - typically into the
toxic intermediate formaldehyde, ii) the oxidation of the
latter compound into formate, and iii) formate oxidation
into carbon dioxide (CO2). In addition, alternative dissimilation mechanism exist in which formate is not
involved. The assimilation of C1-units can be achieved
by different mechanisms starting from either formaldehyde (ribulose-monophosphate pathway, RuMP), CO 2
(Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle, CBB) or methylene-tetrahydrofolate (Me-THF) + CO 2 (serine cycle). Novel
enzymes, biochemical mechanisms, and metabolic pathways have been discovered, resulting in a more complete
description of methylotrophic pathways and their diversity. Interestingly, these findings do not modify our current view of the general organization of C1 pathways,
but show that many more alternative enzymes or pathways than initially assumed carry out each of the basic
steps of methylotrophy. Moreover, a growing number of
newly discovered methylotrophs have been investigated,
showing that different combinations of the various pathways can be found in nature, and leading to the concept
of a modular metabolism [5].

Considerable progress was made in the understanding
of the biochemistry and physiology of methylotrophy,
and valuable insights were obtained regarding the organization and operation of central carbon metabolism
[6-8]. However, a complete, system-level description of
methylotrophy metabolism is currently lacking. The
comprehensive understanding of bacterial physiology
requires a detailed knowledge of the complete metabolic
potential of the studied organism, but such knowledge is
currently missing and no genome-scale metabolic network has been so far established for any methylotrophic
bacterium. In consequence, little is currently known
about the network-scale organization of methylotrophy,
the specific properties of methylotrophic networks, and
how the methylotrophic capacity emerges from this
organization, especially in facultative representatives.
Among the recently sequenced organisms, the Alphaproteobacterium Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 is a
major model of methylotrophic bacteria. This facultative
methylotroph is able to grow on C1- but also on multicarbon (C2-C4) compounds. Methylobacterium spp. are
part of the abundant population of bacteria systematically found in the phyllosphere [4,9], where they benefit
from plant-derived methanol [10,11]. The biochemistry,
genetics, and physiology of M. extorquens AM1 has
been extensively investigated, and allowed the discovery
of major methylotrophic pathways, including the serine
cycle [12-14], the tetrahydromethanopterin (H 4MPT)dependent pathway for formaldehyde oxidation [15,16],
and of a number of novel enzymes or enzyme functions
(e.g., pyrroloquinoline quinine (PQQ)-dependent methanol dehydrogenase, formaldehyde activating enzyme,
methylene-H4MPT dehydrogenases coupled to pyridine
nucleotides, and formyl-methanofuran hydrolase). The
central metabolic pathways were progressively unraveled,
and the application of novel experimental strategies metabolic modeling, metabolic flux analysis, omics technologies - provided valuable insights into the topology
and operation of central carbon metabolism [6-8,17].
Finally, the pathway for methanol assimilation in M.
extorquens AM1 was recently completed with the discovery of the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway (EMCP), an alternative to the glyoxylate cycle for the synthesis of
glyoxylate, which encompasses an unusual series of 12
reactions where intermediates are all Coenzyme A (CoA)
esters [18,19]. Finally, the genome of this bacterium was
recently sequenced and annotated [20], providing inevitable information for genome-scale investigations.
In this work, we report on the integrated, system-level
investigation of the metabolic network of the facultative
methylotroph M. extorquens AM1, as a valuable model of
methylotrophic bacteria. In order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the biochemistry and physiology of

this bacterium, we first evaluated its complete metabolic
potential by compiling current biochemical knowledge
and genome annotation data into a comprehensive genome-scale representation of the metabolic network.
Then, we performed both in silico and experimental
investigations to identify the subnetwork operating during methylotrophic growth, in order to analyze structurally and functionally the system-level organization of
methylotrophy with an emphasis on the properties of the
organization of central carbon metabolism.

Results
Metabolic network reconstruction

The genome-scale (GS) metabolic network of M. extorquens AM1 was reconstructed according to previously
established guidelines [21]. The details of the process
are given in material and methods and are schematically
shown in Additional file 1. Briefly, the GS metabolic
network was obtained by integrating relevant information collected from i) genome annotation [20], ii) published physiological, genetic and biochemical studies in
M. extorquens AM1 and closely related organisms iii)

biochemical information contained in databases [22-24],
vi) complementary investigations (biomass quantification), and intensive refinement (Additional file 2, 3).
The chemical composition of M. extorquens AM1 cell
was determined experimentally or taken from available
literature (Table 1 and Additional file 4) and used to
define the biosynthetic needs and corresponding
pathways.
The refined reconstruction was converted into a mathematical model using CellNetAnalyser [25] and the network was checked for self-consistency and curated to
allow biosynthesis of all cell components from each of
the 12 carbon sources established for M. extorquens
(Additional file 5). In addition, flux balance analysis
(FBA) was used to calculate the theoretical maximum
growth yields for each carbon source. For methanol and
succinate, the theoretical maximum growth rates could
also be calculated and were in agreement with published
data (Additional file 5), showing the consistency of the
network with experimental observations. Last, the capability of the GS network to explain the oxidation of
carbon compounds [26] was validated (Additional file 5).

The final GS network (iRP911) contained 1139 unique
reactions and 977 metabolites, and was based on a
gene-to-protein-to-reaction (GPR) association network
that included 911 genes encoding 761 proteins (Table 2,
Additional file 2, 3). The confidence in the network
information was established by scoring the evidence currently available for each reaction [21]. The confidence
scores ranged from 0 (lowest) to 4 (highest), with the
latter being assigned to a reaction with direct evidence
for both gene product function and biochemical reaction
(Table 2). The average confidence score over the final
network score was 2.1.
Main features of the genome-scale metabolic network of
M. extorquens AM1

M. extorquens AM1 is a facultative methylotroph able to
utilize a relatively narrow range of substrates. The ability
to grow on C3 and C4 organic acids - e.g. lactate, pyruvate, succinate or malate - relies on the presence of common metabolic pathways, which include the tricarboxylic
acid (TCA) cycle, anaplerotic pathways, gluconeogenesis,
pentose-phosphate pathway (PPP), and Entner-Doudoroff
(ED) pathway (Figure 1). Growth on C1 compounds
relies on specific metabolic pathways that were resolved
for this bacterium in the past 50 years [5,16]. The first
step is the oxidation of primary C1 substrates - e.g.
methanol - to formate via methanol dehydrogenase and
the H 4 MPT-dependent C1 pathway. Formate is a key
branch-point to trigger the flow of carbon between dissimilation and assimilation. Dissimilation is achieved by
oxidation of formate into CO2. The assimilation of C1units requires the conversion of formate into methylene
tetrahydrofolate (Me-THF), since the spontaneous condensation of formaldehyde with THF was demonstrated
not to be significant [7]. In the serine cycle, Me-THF is
condensed with a C2 compound - generated from

glyoxylate - to build C3 compounds such as 2-phosphoglycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), which are
further carboxylated to form oxaloacetate (OAA) and
other C4 intermediates. The continuous operation of the
serine cycle requires the operation of the recently discovered EMCP which allows glyoxylate regeneration and
involves CO 2 fixation. These pathways are tightly
embedded into each other and the consequences of such
organization will be detailed later. The C2 compounds
used as carbon source enter metabolism at the level of
the EMCP, from which they feed the central pathways.
M. extorquens possesses also the ability to oxidize 26
additional compounds [26]. These compounds include a
significant number of sugars, mainly pentoses. The
reconstruction data suggest that such capability is due to
the occurrence of soluble sugar dehydrogenases able to
oxidize a wide range of pentoses and other sugars [27];
however, no assimilation processes were identified from
the genome annotation. The reconstructed network contains a potential pathway for the utilization of two sugars
(glucose and gluconate) as carbon source, although M.
extorquens is not known to grow on these compounds.
The identified pathway includes the periplasmic oxidation of glucose into gluconate, which could be internalized and catabolized through the pentose phosphate
pathway (PPP) or the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway.
The glycolytic pathways are quite well established (see
below) but the relevant sugar transport systems have low
annotation confidence scores. Further experimental
investigations will be necessary to determine whether M.
extorquens possesses or not the entire enzymatic repertoire for sugar utilization.
The detailed examination of the biosynthetic pathways
included in the GS network indicated incomplete lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis. The pathways for
keto-deoxyoctulosonate and lipid A synthesis and

assembly were found, but the genes encoding the
enzymes classically involved in heptose biosynthesis and
in sugar incorporation onto the lipid A were missing.
These observations suggest the occurrence of an unusual LPS structure in M. extorquens AM1. Consistently,
no heptose or galactose was detected from the hydrolysis of cell material (see above) though significant contents in rhamnose (8.9 ± 0.9%) and glucose (5.6 ± 0.5%)
were found. The GS network also included the biosynthetic pathways for carotenoids and bacteriochlorophyll
A. The biosynthetic pathway of bacteriochlorophyll was
complete in addition with the presence of the enzymes
of the photosystem I. Several degradation pathways are
missing in the GS network of M. extorquens, including
the degradation of amino acids - e.g. histidine, arginine,
tyrosine - and nucleotides. This is in agreement with
physiological data showing that the occurrence of these
compounds in the cultivation medium did not result in
detectable metabolic activity.
The GS metabolic reconstruction showed that M.
extorquens possesses a respiratory chain with alternative
systems for electron inputs and outputs (Additional file
6). A great variety of potential electron donors could be
identified, including a significant number of soluble
periplasmic dehydrogenases transferring electrons to
cytochrome c, including methanol dehydrogenase, formaldehyde dehydrogenase, and the already-mentioned
soluble sugar dehydrogenase. Three terminal oxidases
were also present, including two ubiquinol oxidases and
one cytochrome c oxidase, suggesting that M. extorquens can adapt an aerobic metabolism to different oxygen levels. Besides oxygen, nitrate might represent a
potential alternative electron acceptor.
Organization of central metabolic pathways

C1 assimilation ensures the conversion of the C1-unit
into precursor metabolites and involves a high number
of metabolic pathways like C1 pathways, serine cycle,
EMCP, TCA cycle, gluconeogenesis, anaplerotic reactions (Figure 1). They are connected by overlapping
metabolites and enzyme reactions. The most central
processes are interconnected cycles (serine cycle, TCA
cycle) or pathways (EMCP, anaplerotic reactions). The
serine cycle shares common reactions with gluconeogenesis (enolase), with the EMCP (malyl-CoA ligase, malylCoA lyase), with the TCA cycle (malate dehydrogenase),
and with amino acid metabolism (serine hydroxymethyltransferase). The EMCP shares also reactions with the
polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) biosynthesis (acetyl-CoA Cacetyltransferase, acetoacetyl-CoA reductase), the TCA
cycle (succinate dehydrogenase, fumarase), and fatty
acid degradation (hydroxybutyryl-CoA (HBCOA) dehydratase, hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase). The overall picture of M. extorquens central metabolism that

Page 5 of 22

emerges from these observations is an unusual series of
metabolic pathways and cycles that are tightly embedded
one into each other and allow operating almost as an
entity. The C3 (2PG, pyruvate and PEP) and C4 (OAA
and malate) intermediates play a critical role in the
overall network organization. They represent the
branching-points of the three main central metabolic
pathways, i.e. the serine cycle, the EMCP and the TCA
cycle, and of anaplerotic processes. Hence, they can be
generated by different metabolic routes [28]. Accordingly, seven different reactions allow the inter-conversion of the five compounds (Figure 1). These reactions
include processes inter-converting i) C3 into C3 (enolase, PEP synthase, pyruvate kinase), ii) C4 into C4
(malate dehydrogenase), iii) C3 into C4 (PEP carboxylase (PEPCL)), and iv) C4 into C3 (PEP carboxykinase
(PEPCK), malic enzyme). Moreover, the C3/C4 interconversions include either reversible reactions (2PG/PEP
and OAA/malate inter-conversion) or irreversible but
opposite reactions (PEP/pyruvate and PEP/OAA interconversions). The result is a dense sub-network of reactions that provides alternative pathways for the same
conversion [28] and the occurrence of potential substrate cycles [29].
Identification of the sub-network operating during
methylotrophic growth

The functional structure of the metabolic network operating during pure methylotrophic growth conditions of
M. extorquens, i.e. growth on methanol as sole source of
carbon and energy, was established by determining the
sub-network of the GS metabolic model that includes
all the reactions operating on methanol, thereafter
referred to as the ‘methylotrophic network’ (Additional
file 1). The identification of the methylotrophic and
non-methylotrophic reactions was based on both theoretical and experimental considerations, including i) physiological parameters ii) genetic and biochemical data,
iii) omics data (transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomics), and extensive refinement. The reactions were
confronted against all above criteria and were included
or excluded a based on multi-criterion consideration
and their overall score (Additional file 7). This reduction
step was also a pre-requisite for in silico analysis of the
methylotrophic network. The size of the GS model was
too big to apply Elementary Flux Mode (EFM) analysis,
a powerful tool to analyze the functional properties of
metabolic networks from their topology [30], due to
computational limitation. The Additional file 1 shows
the diagram of the reduction process which was carried
out in the following manner:

The determination of the methylotrophic network was
performed here to account for conditions where M.

extorquens cells were grown exponentially in a minimal
medium containing methanol as the sole added source
of carbon and energy, NH4Cl as nitrogen source, and
mineral salts, as described in material and methods.
Such growth conditions allowed three levels of reduction of the GS metabolic model. First, the processes

(transport and biochemical reactions) associated with
the utilization of compounds (e.g. carbon sources, nitrogen sources, etc) included in the GS network but not
occurring in the medium were removed. Similarly, the
pathways and transport systems associated with metabolic end-products included in the GS network but not

Peyraud et al. BMC Systems Biology 2011, 5:189
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/5/189

detected experimentally during methylotrophic growth
were removed. Quantitative 1H-NMR analysis of culture
supernatants collected after methylotrophic growth indicated that very few by-products accumulated in the
medium, and only at negligible levels, allowing the
removal of 187 reactions from the GS model. It was also
assumed that in exponentially-growing cells no biomass
degradation occurred, resulting in a further simplification of the network by removing the biochemical pathways specifically involved in the degradation or salvage
of macromolecular components. This simplification
resulted in the removal of 213 biochemical reactions.
Some reactions associated with macromolecule degradation could be potentially involved in other metabolic
processes, such as cofactor biosynthesis or recycling of
anabolic by-products. Some of these reactions - a total
of 13 - appeared to be relevant for growth on methanol
and were kept in the methylotrophic network.
ii) Genetic and biochemical data

Literature data were used to further substantiate the
methylotrophic network. More particularly, the phenotypes of gene deletion mutants were used to support the
reduction process. From currently available literature, a
total of 47 genes were shown to be essential during
growth on methanol. Some of these genes encode multifunctional enzymes, so that a total of 51 biochemical
reactions were associated with the 47 essential genes.
All monofunctional enzymes (42 reactions) were kept in
the methylotrophic model. For multifunctional enzymes,
it could not be determined at this stage which reaction
(s) was (were) responsible for essentiality, and other
considerations were applied before making a decision as
regard to their inclusion or exclusion of the methylotrophic network. In total, 2 reactions were excluded
from genetic data analysis.
The enzyme assays available in the literature were
considered to confirm the presence of biochemical reactions during methylotrophic growth, as well as their differential activities upon non-methylotrophic condition.
Additional biochemical information from in vitro assay
of particular reaction like spontaneous reaction or biochemical information in other microorganisms was used
to validate reaction occurrence. In total, 13 reactions
were excluded from biochemical data analysis.
iii) Omics data

The next reduction step was based on the comparison
of omics data - including transtriptomics [17,31], proteomics [31], and metabolomics data [17,32-35], collected for both methylotrophic-grown and nonmethylotrophic grown M. extorquens cells [17]. The
molecular components corresponding to each type of
omic data - e.g. protein for proteomics data - were kept
in the methylotrophic network when they were identified to occur in methanol-grown cells, and/or their

Page 7 of 22

content was significantly higher - at least twice higher than in non-methanol-grown cells, i.e. succinate-grown
cells. The score of components identified from transcriptomics (differential expression), proteomics (spectral counting, differential expression) and metabolomics
(identification) were assigned to their corresponding
biochemical reactions via the GPR association. Taken
together, the omics data were involved in the confirmation of the occurrence of 175 reactions, and the exclusion of 296 reactions. The final methylotrophic network
contained 717 reactions and 722 metabolites, associated
with 706 genes (Table 1, Additional file 7), and included
approximately two thirds of the components of the GS
network. To validate the topology of the methylotrophic
network, non methylotrophic reactions were constrained
to zero in the stoichiometric model of M. extorquens
metabolism, and the reduced model was used to simulate growth performance on methanol. FBA simulations
showed that the network supports a theoretical maximal
growth rate of 0.20 h-1, which is consistent with experimental values [36]. Moreover, this value was close to
the maximal growth rate calculated with the GS network (0.21 h -1 ), indicating that no significant growth
capacities were lost during the reduction of the GS network and furthermore suggesting that about one-third
of the total metabolic potential of the bacterium is not
required for growth on methanol.
Dissimilation capabilities of the methylotrophic network

The capability of methylotrophs to use methanol as sole
energy and carbon source relies on the occurrence of
both dissimilatory and assimilatory pathways, which fulfill all energetic and biosynthetic requirements, respectively. The reconstruction of the metabolic network of
M. extorquens gave the opportunity to analyze the (system-level) organization of the two types of processes in
this model methylotroph. Elementary flux mode (EFM)
analysis, a powerful tool to analyze the functionality of
metabolic networks from their topology [30], and FBA
simulations, were carried out. Dissimilation and assimilation processes were first analyzed separately.
Dissimilation processes were defined here as processes
resulting in the net conversion of methanol into CO 2
and allowing energy conservation. The main dissimilation route is known to be the stepwise oxidation of
methanol to CO2 using dedicated C1 pathways [5,15].
This process involves the periplasmic oxidation of
methanol into formaldehyde, which is further oxidized
to CO2 in the cytoplasm (see Figure 1). In this process
one cytochrome C and two nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) (NAD(P)H) are released, assuming
the pyridine nucleotide dependent formate dehydrogenase (FDH) operates. This ‘cytoplasmic’ route can fulfill
both adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and redox

requirements at the same time. In case cytochrome C
and NADH are reoxidized by the most effective oxidative phosphorylation mechanisms, a maximal yield of 5
ATP/methanol is predicted (Table 3). The additional
potential routes for methanol dissimilation within the
methylotrophic network could be detailed from the in
silico investigations (Table 3). A periplasmic route of
formaldehyde oxidation can be predicted in case methanol-dehydrogenase-like enzyme XoxF would act together
with a periplasmic formate dehydrogenase [37]. Such a
route would not generate NAD(P)H and hence could
only fulfill ATP requirements, albeit with reduced maximal yield (3 ATP/methanol). The network contains also
other potential alternative mechanisms for the complete
oxidation of methanol in which multi-carbon compounds are first generated and then completely oxidized
to CO 2 . These processes would result from the combined action of C1 assimilation pathways (enabling the
formation of multi-carbon compounds) and of catabolic
pathways where multi-carbon compounds are fully oxidized to CO2 (via the TCA cycle or other decarboxylation reactions). The latter processes are the main energy
conservation mechanisms upon utilization of C2 and
other multi-carbon compounds, and are likely to be
down-regulated during pure methylotrophic growth
conditions. Nevertheless, the in silico analysis shows
that the methylotrophic network contains the potential
for these indirect dissimilation routes. They are however
not efficient for energy conservation (Table 3) and are
unlikely to operate upon methylotrophy from the energetic point of view.

precursors (Table 4, Additional file 8). The serine cycle
was involved in all assimilatory EFMs except for MeTHF, which can be also generated directly in the C1
pathways. This observation was consistent with the key
role of the serine cycle pathway in methanol assimilation. The EMCP was involved in 93%, 95%, and 92% of
the EFMs generating Me-THF, acetyl-CoA, and (R)-3HBCOA, respectively. For all other carbon precursors,
including the serine cycle intermediate glycine and Lserine, all assimilatory EFMs required the EMCP. These
data emphasize the critical role of the EMCP (12 reactions), in addition to the C1 pathways (10 reactions) and
the serine cycle (9 reactions), in methanol assimilation.
Hence, the initial steps of C1 assimilation require the
consecutive but obligatory operation of a high number
of reactions. The minimal EFM length, representing the
smallest number of reactions needed to convert methanol into each carbon precursor, was calculated for each
of the 13 carbon precursors. The conversion of methanol into C3 compounds required at least 50 reactions,
and the minimal number of reactions required to convert methanol into E4P was 63. Even for Me-THF and
acetyl-CoA, the minimal EFM lengths were high (20 and
35, respectively). These data indicated that the primary
assimilation processes, ensuring the conversion of
methanol into carbon precursors, is a particularly complex process in M. extorquens AM1. Despite the complexity of methanol assimilation, the carbon precursors
are produced from methanol with carbon yields that are
similar to that observed on glucose for species like E.
coli and C. glutamicum.

Assimilatory processes

Interdependencies of dissimilatory and assimilatory
processes

The consequences of the particular organization of primary C1 assimilation in M. extorquens AM1 were analyzed by examining the processes allowing the
conversion of methanol into each of the 13 key carbon
precursors, including C1 (Me-THF), C2 (acetyl-CoA,
glycine), C3 (L-serine, pyruvate, PEP, glyceraldehyde-3phosphate), C4 (OAA, D-erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P),
3HBCOA), C5 (a-ketoglutarate, D-ribose-5-phosphate)
and C6 (D-glucose-6-phosphate (G6P)). The number of
EFMs ranged from 2018 to 6576 for the various carbon

The energetic efficiency of dissimilation processes determines the amount of energy available for assimilation
and hence is a critical parameter of methylotrophic
growth. The complete set of EFMs (152872) through the
methylotrophic network was analyzed to investigate the
relationships between dissimilation and assimilation
processes. The EFMs were classified according to their
biomass yields, and then to the various types of dissimilatory processes (Figure 2). In the EFM with the optimal

directly oxidized via C1 pathways and the remaining
was used for assimilation purposes. In a significant
number of assimilatory EFMs, methanol was entirely
oxidized to CO2 via the C1 pathways (Figure 2), meaning that no reduced carbon entered assimilatory pathways, and indicating that biomass could be fully

molecules enter the serine cycle to produce two glycine
molecules. One glycine is converted by the glycine cleavage complex into one CO2 and one Me-THF. The latter compound allows the conversion of the second
glycine molecule into serine, which is used in subsequent steps of the serine cycle, allowing both the regeneration of the initial acetyl-CoA molecule and enabling through the operation of the entire mechanism - the
formation of all carbon precursors needed for biosynthetic purposes. The overall carbon balance is 2 CO2 ®
1 glyoxylate. As this process requires the release of MeTHF via the glycine decarboxylase complex, it represents a distinct feature compared to the classical operation of the serine cycle. The carbon yield of the CO2assimilation process is significantly lower than observed
for methanol assimilation (40% vs 62%). The ATP needs
are twice higher (7.2 vs 3.8 mol · mol(carbon assimilated)-1 ), and the redox needs are two to three times
more elevated. Such high energetic costs can be covered
by methanol oxidation, but the overall CO2 assimilation
process is much less favorable than methanol assimilation. This CO2 assimilation process was not reported so
far and is a direct consequence of the capability of the
EMCP to ensure CO2 fixation.

Figure 3 EFM analysis of the balance between dissimilation
and assimilation in EMCP and ICL variants. The biomass-forming
EFMs were calculated and sorted according to the biomass yield
(from bottom to top, blue color scale). For each EFM, the flux
through the main dissimilatory processes (see text for details) were
extracted and plotted separately. Fluxes were expressed relative to
the rate of methanol uptake, and were plotted using a colour-scale
(black to green). First lane: cytoplasmic FDH, fdh(c); second lane:
periplasmic FDH, fdh(p); third lane: TCA oxidation of acetyl-CoA,
TCAc; fourth lane: other dissimilation process. A: EFMs calculated
with the methylotrophic network, which contains the ethylmalonylCoA pathway (EMCP). B: EFMs calculated with the network variant
where EMCP was replaced by the glyoxylate cycle (ICL variant).

The recently discovered EMCP is an alternative to the
classical glyoxylate cycle for the biosynthesis of glyoxylate from acetyl-CoA in organisms lacking isocitrate
lyase (ICL) [18,19,38]. To compare the metabolic properties conferred by the EMCP with that of the glyoxylate
cycle, we generated a variant of the methylotrophic network lacking the EMCP but possessing the glyoxylate
cycle. This was done by setting to zero the flux from
crotonyl-CoA to propionyl-CoA and by adding the ICL
reaction. Malate synthase, the enzyme of the glyoxylate
cycle that catalyzes the condensation of acetyl-CoA and
glyoxylate into malate, was not added since M. extorquens can use a combination of two enzymes to achieve
the same reaction [39], as described also in R. sphaeroids [40]. As expected, the glyoxylate cycle was essential
for methanol growth and was found in all assimilatory
EFMs. The maximal biomass yield predicted for the ICL
variant (0.41 g · g-1) was similar to that observed for the
EMCP variant yield (0.42 g · g-1). To obtain such maximal growth, the rate of methanol oxidation in the ICL
variant was smaller (61% vs 70%) and the NADPH
requirements lower than in the EMCP variant, showing
a higher energetic efficiency of the ICL variant. In contrast to the EMCP, the ICL variant was not found to
allow entire biomass formation from CO2.
To investigate the potential role of the EMCP in redox
balancing, we compared the capability of the two

Peyraud et al. BMC Systems Biology 2011, 5:189
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/5/189

metabolic network variants to respond to varying
NADPH production levels. FBA simulations were performed where the amount of NADPH produced by the
Me-H4MPT dehydrogenase MtdB [41], which can use
either NADH or NADPH, was varied from 0 to 15.0
mmol · g-1 · h-1 (0 to 100% of MtdB flux). For both the
EMCP and ICL variants, the absence of NADPH production in the C1 pathways can be compensated by
other NADPH-production systems, the PPP or malic
enzyme. The theoretical maximal growth rate increased
with NADPH production until a maximum is reached,
which represents the optimal balance between NADPH
production and growth. Maximal growth for the EMCP
variant was obtained at higher NADPH production level
than the ICL variant (9.0 vs 7.7 mmol · g -1 · h -1 ), in
agreement with the higher redox demand identified previously. The EMCP variant was able to maintain higher
growth rates when the NADPH production was further
increased. This capability was correlated with a significant increase of the EMCP flux. The increase in the
EMCP flux was accompanied by the truncation of the
serine cycle. Rather than being converted to OAA, PEP
is converted into pyruvate via pyruvate kinase, which is
further converted by pyruvate dehydrogenase into
acetyl-CoA, which enters the EMCP. This pathway generates ATP (via pyruvate kinase) and releases NADH
(via pyruvate dehydrogenase), resulting in a transhydrogenase-like mechanism where the redox equivalents are
transferred from NADPH to NAD+ in addition to the
transfer to CO2.
Fragility of the methylotrophic network

Robustness is an inherent property of a metabolic network and is defined as the capability of this network to
operate despite one - or more - reactions are removed.
The robustness of the methylotrophic network was analysed using minimal cut sets (MCSs), which correspond
to minimal combinations - singlets, pairs, triplets, etc of reactions whose removal blocks the operation of a
target metabolic function [42]. The identification of all
MCSs in a metabolic network allows the calculations of
the fragility coefficient (FC) of each reaction. The FC of
a reaction represents the probability that the metabolic
system fails to achieve the target function when the
reaction is removed. This approach was applied to analyze the robustness of the methylotrophic network using
growth as the target metabolic function. A significant
number of reactions (391) were found to have a FC of 1
and are therefore predicted to be essential (Additional
file 9). Among these 391 reactions, 30% are catalyzed by
multiple enzymes, indicating that enzyme redundancy is
significantly used to avoid metabolic resilience in M.
extorquens AM1. Most of the essential reactions (279)
were found in biosynthetic pathways, which is consistent

Page 11 of 22

with studies performed with other organisms. The FCs
of reactions found in central metabolism spanned over a
wide range of values but distributed heterogeneously
among metabolic pathways (Figure 4). Some processes,
such as the C1- and carbohydrate pathways, and C3/C4
interconversion reactions, had low FCs and hence were
predicted to be robust parts of the metabolism. Most
other parts of the central metabolism had high FCs and
hence were predicted to be fragile. Of the 84 reactions
of the central carbon metabolism, 40 were found to be
essential. The essential reactions concentrated in the
primary assimilation processes (Figure 4). Most reactions of the serine cycle (67%) and of the EMCP (100%)
were predicted to be essential for methylotrophic
growth, indicating the assimilation processes to be
highly fragile. The same observation holds true for gluconeogenesis. Because a particular reaction can be catalyzed by one or several enzymes, the essentiality of a
reaction does not necessarily mean that the removal by gene deletion - of one particular enzyme will be
lethal. Among the 40 essential reactions found in central
pathways, 29 were catalyzed by a single enzyme.
Accordingly, 19 of these genes have been studied experimentally, and 95% of them were shown to be lethal for
methylotrophic growth [43] (Additional file 10). For an
essential reaction with multiple enzymes, one isoenzyme
can compensate the lack of the other one(s). Genes
encoding isoenzymes are therefore predicted to be not
essential. However, mutant analysis showed that 4 out
of 11 essential reactions with multiple enzymes found in
primary assimilation processes, were encoded by gene
where deletion were lethal for growth on methanol.
This observation suggests that the products of these
genes play an essential role during growth on methanol
that cannot be compensated by the other potential
enzymes catalysing the same reactions, or that they have
different regulations, or both. Taken together, these data
showed that the main processes of methanol assimilation are highly fragile in M. extorquens AM1. The
robustness of the metabolism of M. extorquens AM1
was also calculated for a C2 compound (acetate), and
for a C4 compound (succinate). The data were compared to that calculated for E. coli using the model of
Klamt et al. [42,44]. The utilization of C2 compounds
like acetate relies on the EMC pathway in M. extorquens
and on the glyoxylate cycle in E. coli. Interestingly, the
metabolic robustness of the central metabolism upon
acetate growth was calculated to be lower in the former
organism compared to the latter. Upon growth on succinate, which does not rely on C1-associated pathways but
on common pathways (e.g. TCA cycle) that are similar
in the two organisms, metabolic robustness was calculated to be similar between the two organisms. These
observations suggest that metabolic fragility in M.

extorquens is mainly related to the nature and organization of C1 (& C2) pathways in this organism.
Distribution of metabolic fluxes during methylotrophic
growth

The distribution of metabolic fluxes during methylotrophic growth was determined using 13C-metabolic flux
analysis (13C-MFA). 13C-MFA was already successfully
applied to M. extorquens AM1, which provided valuable
insights into the operation of central pathways [8]. The
novel insights such as the operation of the EMCP [19],
the organization of central assimilatory pathways [17],
and the biomass composition (this study) necessitates
the reinvestigation of metabolic flux analysis in M.
extorquens AM1 during growth on methanol. To this
end, a series of 13C-methanol labeling experiments was
performed, and the isotopic information was monitored
by both mass spectrometry and two dimensional nuclear
magnetic resonance (2D-NMR) [45] (Additional file 11,
12). Such analytical combination provides critical information for the resolution of central pathways [19]. The
flux distribution obtained from these investigations is
displayed in Figure 5 and listed in Additional file 13,
and the fitting accuracy and sensitivity analysis are listed
in Additional files 12, 13, 14 and 15. The flux data
obtained in the present were significantly different from
that previously published [8]. This is mainly due to the
major advances made in the meantime in the description and understanding of M. extorquens metabolism,
and it is now known that the size and topology - and
hence the possible carbon flows - of central carbon
metabolism are more complete and much different than
previously assumed. For this reason they can be hardly
compared.
The flux data of Figure 5 indicated that 12.7 ± 0.6 mmol
· g -1 · h -1 of methanol, 84% of methanol consumed
(15.10 ± 0.60 mmol · g-1 · h-1), was directly oxidized to
CO2 within the C1 pathways. A release of CO2 was also
observed within biosynthetic pathways (2.6% of consumed methanol) and central metabolism (5.4%). The
release of CO2 in central metabolism was due to substantial fluxes through malic enzyme (0.36 mmol · g-1 ·
h -1 ) and PEPCK (0.26 mmol · g -1 · h -1 ), but was not
associated with dissimilation processes. Indeed, the TCA
contributed to only 1.1% of total CO2 release and operated in an incomplete and anabolic mode. The flux of
C1 assimilation via Me-THF was 2.4 ± 0.02 mmol · g-1 ·
h-1, which represents 16% of methanol uptake. The flux
data clearly showed the central role of the serine cycle
in distributing the carbon flow throughout the entire
metabolic network to fulfill the requirements in carbon
precursors. About 20% (0.5 mmol · g-1 · h-1) was directed towards gluconeogenesis and carbohydrate pathways,
and 30% was routed to the formation of pyruvate and

Page 13 of 22

TCA cycle intermediates. The release of acetyl-CoA by
the serine cycle was significant (1.80 mmol · g-1 · h-1).
The major part (1.4 mmol · g-1 · h-1) was recycled back
to the serine cycle by the EMCP, and the remaining was
used for anabolic purposes. The fixation of CO2 occurring within central pathways was calculated from the
difference between CO 2 -utilizing and CO 2 -releasing
fluxes, and was 2.4 mmol · g-1 · h-1. This value was similar to the rate of methanol assimilation via Me-THF (2.4
mmol · g-1 · h-1). These data were consistent with the
observation that 50% of the biomass carbon derived
from CO2 [7,46]. Such carbon balance can be obtained
in case two molecules of glyoxylate are generated per
turn of the EMCP [19], which requires that the propionyl-CoA produced in this pathway is not directly used
for anabolic purposes but converted into glyoxylate.
Accordingly, the replenishment of the glyoxylate pool
from propionyl-CoA was almost identical to the direct
release of glyoxylate within the EMCP (0.70 ± 0.02
mmol · g-1 · h-1). No flux was found through the glycine
cleavage complex, indicating that the CO2 assimilation
mechanism identified from EFM analysis was not operating during pure methylotrophy, for chosen cultivation
conditions. Surprisingly, a glycolytic flux through the
Entner-Doudoroff pathway was observed. This flux (0.08
± 0.02 mmol · g-1 · h-1) was low compared to the rate of
formate assimilation but was significant to fit the labeling data and represented about 14% of total pyruvate
synthesis. This observation indicated that some carbon
atoms were recycled through gluconeogenesis and glycolysis during methylotrophic growth.
The flux data provided valuable information regarding
the C3/C4 pathways. The synthesis of pyruvate, which is
required for various anabolic purposes, was proposed
earlier to proceed via the conversion of PEP into pyruvate, via pyruvate kinase [6]. The flux data showed that
pyruvate was synthesized by three different routes,
including pyruvate kinase, the ED pathway and malic
enzyme. The main flux was carried out by malic enzyme
(0.36 vs 0.13 mmol · g-1 · h-1). Moreover PEP synthase,
which catalyses the reaction opposite to pyruvate kinase,
is active and its flux (0.13 mmol · g -1 · h -1 ) is higher
than that of the latter enzyme. This observation indicated the occurrence of a substrate cycle between PEP
and pyruvate due to the parallel activity of pyruvate
kinase and PEP synthase, and in which 68% of pyruvate
is recycled. Three additional substrate cycles were
observed in this part of the metabolism. Two of them
were related to C3/C4 inter-conversions: i) PEP/OAA
cycling via PEPCL and PEPCK (13% of PEP recycled),
and ii) PEP/malate/pyruvate cycling via PEPCL, malate
dehydrogenase, malic enzyme and PEP synthase (4% of
PEP recycled via malate and pyruvate). The fourth substrate cycle was observed between malate and (acetyl-

Figure 5 Distribution of fluxes in the central metabolic network of M. extorquens AM1 upon methylotrophic growth. Carbon fluxes
were calculated from 183 isotopomer measurements (NMR + MS data) collected during steady-state growth of M. extorquens AM1 on [13C]methanol. Fluxes are given in mmol · g-1 · h-1, with standard deviations given below flux values. Exchange fluxes through reversible reactions are
given within brackets. The width of the arrows is proportional to the flux value.

CoA+glyoxylate). It relies on the reversible activity of
the malyl-CoA lyase [47] and on the parallel operation
of malate-CoA ligase and malyl-CoA thioesterase.
Malate-CoA ligase is responsible for the release of
glyoxylate and acetyl-CoA from malyl-CoA in the serine
cycle. Malyl-CoA thioesterase catalyzes the opposite
reaction. This enzyme is supposed to play a key role
during growth on multicarbon compounds, but its activity is not expected during methylotrophic growth.
Indeed, the enzyme activity is down regulated during
growth in the presence of methanol [48]. However, a
significant activity of this enzyme is still detected upon
methanol growth [48], and represents 22% of the activity
found on acetate. Such level of activity is likely to be
sufficient to maintain a flux in the reaction, thereby
resulting in substrate cycling. The flux data show not
only that the latter cycle operates in M. extorquens AM1
during growth on methanol, but also that the extent of
recycling is significant (32%). The energetic cost of
metabolite recycling within the four above-mentioned
processes was calculated from the flux data to be 1.3
mmol ATP · g-1 · h-1, with the most expensive one (0.8
mmol ATP · g -1 · h -1 ) being the malate/(acetyl-CoA
+glyoxylate) cycle. The energetic cost was calculated to
represent about 4% of the total production of ATP (29.3
ATP mmol · g -1 · h -1 ). This energetic expense might
represent a tradeoff between optimal metabolic efficiency and the ability to switch metabolic modes.
The total demand in NADPH during methylotrophic
growth could be calculated from the fluxes in NADPHutilizing reactions and biomass requirements, and was
5.6 mmol · g -1 · h -1 . The demand was mainly due for
formate assimilation (2.3 mmol · g-1 · h-1), biosynthetic
requirements (1.8 mmol · g-1 · h-1), and operation of the
EMCP (1.4 mmol · g-1 · h-1). The 13C-flux data showed
also that the two NADPH-forming reactions found
within central carbon pathways, i.e. isocitrate dehydrogenase and G6P dehydrogenase, contributed only negligibly (below 5%) to the total NADPH production.
Hence, most of NADPH is generated alongside formaldehyde oxidation. From these data it can be calculated
that the production of NADPH in the C1 pathway
should be 5.3 mmol · g-1 · h-1 to close the NADP balance. To evaluate the ATP balance, flux variability analysis and FBA simulations were performed in which the
methylotrophic network was constrained with the 13Cflux data, biomass requirements, experimental rates of
growth and methanol uptake, and maintenance energy.
Because the respiratory mechanisms by which the
reduced cofactors (NADH, cytochrome C) generated in
the C1 pathways are not clearly established in M. extorquens the ATP cannot be firmly established from the
flux data. Nevertheless, the simulations showed that, if
dissimilation proceeds via the cytoplasmic, NADH-

Page 15 of 22

dependent route at maximal ATP efficiency (Table 3),
then the total production of ATP (44 mmol · g-1 · h-1)
would be in large excess compared to the requirements
(29.3 mmol · g-1 · h-1).

Discussion
The genome scale metabolic network reconstructed in
this work offers an integrated view of the current metabolic knowledge of the methylotrophic bacterium M.
extorquens AM1. It provides new insights into the biochemistry of this organism and reveals the networkscale organization of metabolic processes as well as a
first evaluation of the complete metabolic potential of
this bacterium. The metabolic reconstruction allowed a
detailed picture of the central carbon metabolism of the
bacterium, which appears as a mosaic of common (TCA
cycle, anaplerotic processes, gluconeogenesis, PPP, ED
pathway) and specific (C1 pathways, serine cycle,
EMCP) pathways, enabling growth on C1 and multicarbon (C2 to C4) compounds. The core of the central
metabolism is organized as a highly unusual series of
tightly embedded metabolic cycles that operate as an
entity to achieve C1 assimilation during methylotrophic
growth. The ability to assimilate C1 compounds relies
on a complex metabolic machinery, in which the initial
steps - from methanol to biomass precursors - require a
particularly high number of reactions (e.g. at least 36
reactions to obtain acetyl-CoA). The entire process is
strongly reductive and energy-consuming. Most of these
reactions require enzymes and cofactors that are specific
to C1 - or C2 - growth, and must be biosynthesized for
the purpose of C1 or C2 utilization. Hence, the energetic costs for the biosynthesis and maintenance of this
machinery are likely to be substantial for the bacteria. In
addition, the network-scale analysis reveals that C1
assimilation is structurally fragile. Similarly to other
metabolically specialized microorganisms [49], the core
metabolism of M. extorquens is characterized by a high
fraction of reactions that are essential for methylotrophic growth (almost 50%). In such networks robustness arise usually from enzyme (and genetic)
redundancy, where multiple isoenzymes can catalyze
essential reactions [49,50]. The genetic or biochemical
deficiency in one isoenzyme can be compensated by
another one. Accordingly, the percentage of multiple
genes encoding essential reactions in specialized microorganisms is much higher than in generalist - or flexible
- organisms such as E. coli, B. subtilis or S. cerevisiae (>
30% vs 10% redundancy, respectively) [50]. The high
degree of redundancy (28%) observed in M. extorquens
confirms the specialized metabolism of this methylotroph. Furthermore, among the essential reactions with
multiple genes, a significant number of particular genes
were shown experimentally to be essential for growth

Peyraud et al. BMC Systems Biology 2011, 5:189
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/5/189

on methanol, suggesting that the alternative gene(s)
have different functions or regulations, hence are not
functionally redundant. Therefore, the number of genes
essential for methylotrophy is high, and the risk that a
gene mutation results in loss of methylotrophic capacity
is elevated. This could explain, in part, the successes in
the identification of such genes in the last 2 decades
[43]. The observations emerging from metabolic network analysis are highly consistent with experimental
evolution experiments in which a significant number of
clones collected after prolonged cultivation (1500 generations) on succinate lost their methylotrophic capacity
[36]. Taken together, available data suggest that a selection pressure is required to maintain methylotrophy in
M. extorquens, indicating that the bacterium encounters
frequently methanol in its natural environment and that
its usage provides critical advantage in terms of ecological competitiveness.
The metabolic reconstruction data indicate also that a
dense network of C3/C4 inter-conversions plays a critical role as a branch-point connecting specific and common pathways. Indeed, seven reactions interconnect
three C3 (2PG, PEP, pyruvate) and two C4 (malate,
OAA) intermediates, thereby strongly embedding the
serine cycle, the TCA cycle, anaplerotic processes, and
gluconeogenesis (via 2PG). Such topology allows a wide
range of alternative metabolic routes and provides metabolic flexibility. Van Dien et al. [6,28] have emphasized
the role of these processes in the metabolism of multicarbon compounds. During growth on C4 compounds
such as succinate, a functional TCA cycle is required
and the generation of acetyl-CoA is ensured by pyruvate
dehydrogenase. Hence, the conversion of C4 compounds
into pyruvate is critical and can be achieved by redundant routes. During methylotrophic growth - in which a
complete TCA does not operate -, the C3/C4 inter-conversions primarily ensure the opposite conversion of C3
intermediates into C4 intermediates in the serine cycle.
They provide also alternative metabolic routes for such
conversions, as observed with the significant conversion
of PEP into pyruvate via PEPCL, malate dehydrogenase,
and malic enzyme, though the role of this pathway is
still unclear. The most striking feature is, however, the
occurrence of substantial substrate cycling within the
C3/C4 inter-conversions upon growth on methanol. In
addition, substrate cycling was also observed between
C4 (malate) and C2 (glyoxylate + acetyl-CoA), at the
branch-point between the serine cycle, the TCA cycle,
the EMCP and anaplerosis. Substrate cycles are resulting
from the simultaneous operation of - non reversible opposite reactions or processes, at the expense of
energy. They can represent adaptation mechanisms
allowing fast switching of metabolic processes [17,29].
The nature of the substrates cycles observed predicted

Page 16 of 22

during methylotrophic growth indicated that the entire
set of reactions starting from PEP or pyruvate to acetylCoA and glyoxylate are operating as a fully reversible
process. As mentioned above, these processes are the
branching-point of the specific - i.e. serine cycle, EMCP
- and common - i.e. TCA cycle, anaplerotic processes,
and gluconeogenesis - pathways. They are also the starting point of a large number of biosynthetic routes, and
the entry point of the utilization pathways of all C1, C2
and C3/C4 carbon sources used by the bacterium.
Taken together, these data suggest that upon pure
methylotrophic growth the occurrence of substrate
cycling provides flexibility between specific and common
pathways, thereby allowing fast switching of the metabolism from methanol to alternative carbon substrates.
Though M. extorquens AM1 is considered to be a
methylotroph but not an autotroph, the in silico investigations revealed a potential of autotrophy in this bacterium, which relies on the unique property of the EMCP
to enable CO2 fixation. The CO2-fixation mode involves
a cyclic operation of both the EMCP and serine cycle to
generate one glyoxylate from two CO2. It can potentially
operate independently of methanol assimilation in M.
extorquens, but was not observed during methylotrophic
growth in our investigations. Because the genome of M.
extorquens contains the complete information for a
photosynthetic machinery, it is tempting to speculate
that this bacterium may operate in a photoautotrophic
mode. However, there is currently no experimental evidence of such behavior in M. extorquens. The question
of the role, benefit and conservation of this pathway in
M. extorquens and other organisms is still unclear. The
EMCP is more complex and energy-demanding than the
glyoxylate cycle though it provides a higher carbon balance for assimilation. In photosynthetic methanol utilizers, carbon dioxide functions as an electron sink for
the excess electrons in methanol [51]. It was recently
proposed that CO2 fixation could represent an alternative mechanism of cofactor recycling in bacteria [52].
The potential role of the EMCP in such mechanism was
recently shown from investigations of CBB mutants
defective for the reductive PPP pathway in acetategrown R. sphaeroides [53]. Our investigations show that
the EMCP can potentially play such a role in M. extorquens upon methylotrophic growth. If further investigations are required to determine the actual physiological
benefits of the EMCP in serine cycle methylotrophs, our
investigations show that this pathway can potentially
play the role of a redox-balancing mechanism or of an
autotrophic pathway.

Conclusions
The unusual organization of the central carbon metabolism of M. extorquens AM1 allows efficient utilization of

Peyraud et al. BMC Systems Biology 2011, 5:189
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/5/189

C1 compounds via highly specific - and fragile - pathways but is versatile enough around a flexible backbone
of C2/C3/C4 inter-conversions to allow switching to
other carbon sources. These observations showed that
the bacterium maintains active metabolic processes that
are not needed for methanol utilization but allow adaptation to other carbon sources. This hypothesis is consistent with the observation that methanol is produced
by plant with methanol release in the morning [54,55].
This work emphasizes that the metabolism of the bacterium is adapted to its lifestyle not only in terms of
enzymatic equipment, but also in terms of network-level
structure and regulation. It suggests that the metabolism
of the bacterium is adapted both structurally and functionally to an efficient but transitory utilization of
methanol. This work illustrates that the combination of
GS network modeling and experimental approaches provides novel insights into the biochemistry and physiology of methylotrophic bacteria, which could be
extended to obligate methylotrophs and to the comparison of serine cycle versus RuMP- and CBB-utilizing
methylotrophs. Methanol is currently regarded as a
highly attractive raw material for microbial bioprocesses
[56]. Comprehensive, system-level understanding of
methylotrophic metabolism is also expected to improve
the biotechnological value of methylotrophy, and this
knowledge will serve as a sound basis for a rational
remodeling of existing biosynthesis routes and for the
design of new synthetic pathways [1].

Methods
Network reconstruction

The genome-scale (GS) metabolic network of M. extorquens AM1 was reconstructed using procedures recommended for the generation of high-quality
reconstructions [21]. The detailed procedure is given in
Additional file 1. Briefly, the process of metabolic reconstruction included the following steps:
1. Generating a draft reconstruction. The genome
information was extracted from the MicroScope
database [57] on December 9th, 2009. Genes annotated for metabolic functions were selected and
assembled with biochemical information collected
from literature. The data were completed using
metabolic databases - mainly Metacyc [24], KEGG
[22] -. During the reconstruction process, systematic
Blast and interrogation of metabolic databases were
performed to refine weak - or missing - genome
annotation information or new published data. In
some cases this process leads to the re-annotation of
genes and the publicly available annotation was corrected accordingly.

Page 17 of 22

2. The reconstruction was refined from all genetic,
biochemical, and physiological data available for M.
extorquens and related species, metabolic (Metacyc,
KEGG) and transporter (TCDB, http://www.tcdb.
org/) databases, and from self-expertise on methylotrophy (Additional file 1). Metabolite information
such as the name, molecular formula and metabolic
database identifiers of compounds were included in
the network, and refined from available metabolomics data for 157 metabolites [35]. Neutral formulas
obtained from PubChem http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/ were used to validate reaction stoichiometry
(mass balancing) including proton balance.
3. Generation of a Gene-to-Protein-to-Reaction
(GPR) association network. The GPR association was
designed to describe explicitly all the relationships
between molecular species and functional activities.
Specific identifiers were assigned to enzymes, reactions and metabolites.
4. Gap-filling. A draft metabolic map, drawn using
the software Cytoscape [58], was used as starting
point for the gap filling process. Gaps were identified
from stand-alone reactions or metabolites, and from
missing connections in essential metabolic processes.
Spontaneous reactions, and reactions or transports
without associated genes in M. extorquens genome,
were added according to metabolic (Metacyc,
KEGG) and transport (TCDB) databases.
5. Conversion of the reconstruction into computational format. The reconstruction was loaded into
the software CellNetAnalyser [25]. The consistency
of the reconstructed network was evaluated from in
silico investigations (modeling) and from the ability
of the network to explain growth on the most studied carbon sources, namely methanol and succinate.
Experimental information [26] was used to identify
substrate utilization. Exchange reactions - i.e.
exchange with environment - were finally added corresponding to known substrates usage and minimal
medium composition.
6. Quality assessment. The quality of the reconstructed network was determined according to [21]
by assigning a confidence score to each individual
reaction, depending on the evidence for the presence
of the reaction, with the highest score given to
experimentally demonstrated reactions and the lowest score given to gap-filling reactions.
The detailed list of reactions, metabolites, and other
network components, and the GPR association network
are given in Additional file 2, 3. The computer model of
iRP911 written in Systems Biology Markup Language
(sbml) is given in the additional file 16.

Determination of the chemical composition of cells

iii) Carbohydrate content

M. extorquens AM1 was grown in fed-batch mode in
mineral medium containing methanol as sole carbon
and energy source, as described in [19]. For cell dry
weight (CDW) determination, 30 ml of culture were
centrifuged in a 50 ml falcon tube and washed with deionized water and dried to constant weight at 80°C. Falcon tubes were incubated for several days at 80°C prior
to use. For other measurements, cells were harvested by
centrifugation at 5000 g during 5 min. Cell pellets were
frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -20°C until
analysis.

the carbohydrate content was measured after hydrolysis
of the entire cell pellet. A two-step derivatization was
used to convert carbohydrates into oxime trimethylsilyl
derivates [61], which were analyzed by GC-FID. For glucose and rhamnose quantification, cells (1-3 mg CDW)
were directly subjected to 200 μl 2 M HCl at 80°C for 4
hrs or to 4 M HCl for 16 hrs for glucosamine quantification, respectively; carbohydrates were stable under
these conditions. After neutralization, 50 μl of 25 mM
lactose solution was added as an internal standard. Samples were vacuum-dried and derivatized for 40 min with
150 μl 0.5 M hydroxylamine·HCl in pyridine at 80°C.
After addition of 110 μl (trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamid
(BSTFA), samples were incubated for another 20 min.
Separation and quantification of the derivatives were
performed by GC-FID as described under lipids except
that column flow was set to 2.7 ml/min and temperature
gradient was run from 160°C to 310°C with 7°C per min.

i) Lipid content

whole cell hydrolysis with subsequent acid methylation
of fatty acids was carried out as described in [38] with
slight modifications. Cells (10-20 mg CDW) were hydrolyzed with 4 ml of 15% NaOH (w/v) in methanol/water
(1:1, v/v) for 30 min at 100°C. Fatty acid methyl esters
(FAMEs) were obtained by addition of 8 ml 6 M HCl/
methanol (13:11, v/v) and incubation for 2.5 hrs at 80°C.
An internal fatty acid standard (3 mg C15:0) was added
before hydrolysis for quantification purpose. The methylation yield was measured from the addition of a FAME
standard (3 mg C19:0 FAME) after the methylation step.
FAMEs were extracted with 5 ml hexane/methyl-tertbutyl ether (1:1, v/v) and washed with 6 ml 1% NaOH
in water (w/v). Extracted FAMEs were analyzed by gas
chromatography - flame ionization detector (GC-FID)
(Agilent Technologies 6850 with 7683B Series injector
and FID detector) and a HP-5 column, length 30 m, I.D.
0.25 mm, film 0.25 μm (Agilent Technologies). Helium
was the carrier gas with a column flow of 2.4 ml/min;
detector temperature was set to 300°C, and inlet to 250°
C. A temperature gradient was run from 190°C to 260°C
at 5°C per min. A sample volume of 1 μl was injected
with a spilt ratio of 30.
ii) Protein content

total proteins were quantified by the Biuret method [59],
using bovine serum albumine (2 mg/ml) as standard.
This method is independent of protein composition [60].
Cells were hydrolyzed in 0.75 ml 1N NaOH (1-2 mg/ml
CDW) at 100°C for 5 min. After addition of 0.25 ml of
2.5% CuSO4 (w/v), samples were centrifuged and absorption was measured at 550 nm. The composition in amino
acids of proteins was determined following hydrolysis in
6 M HCl at 110°C for 22 hours under argon samples
were dried and derivatized using the AccQ-Tag™ Ultra
derivatization chemistry (Waters Corp., Milford, MA,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s instruction.
Amino acid derivatives were separated by UPLC (Waters
Corp., Milford, MA, USA) using the AccQ-Tag™ Ultra
standard hydrolysate conditions. Amino acid derivatives
were detected by UV absorbance.

iv) Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) content

The measurement of the PHB content was performed
according to [62,63]. Cell pellets (3-4 mg) were lyophilized and subjected to acid methanolysis with 3% H2SO4
(v/v) in methanol/chloroform 1:1 (v/v) for 2.5 hrs at
100°C. Benzoic acid was added as an internal standard
prior methanolysis. Methyl-hyroxybutyryl monomers
were extracted after addition of water (20% v/v) and vigorous mixing, The organic phase was analyzed by GCFID with a DB-WAX column, length 15 m, I.D. 0.32
mm, film 0.5 μm. Column flow was set to 1.8 ml/min,
detector temperature to 270°C and inlet temperature to
240°C. A sample volume of 1 μl was injected with a
split ratio of 2. Temperature gradient was run from 90°
C to 230°C at 40°C/min.
v) DNA content

The DNA content was calculated from that in E. coli [64],
using appropriate corrections to account for the size of M.
extorquens genome and for its growth rate on methanol.
vi) RNA content

The RNA content was determined from the amount of
ribose released after acidic hydrolysis (2M HCl for 2
hrs), assuming that all ribose was derived from RNA.
The hydrolysis yield was determined from commercial
RNA and data were corrected accordingly. Ribose was
quantified as described under iii).
vii) Polyamine content

The polyamine content was calculated from that in E.
coli. The occurrence of putrescine in methanol-grown
M. extorquens cells was also confirmed by GC-MS-MS.
viii) Carotenoid content

Data were taken from [65]. Based on their experimentally determined chemical properties, they were assumed
to be spirilloxanthin-like carotenoids.

ix) Content in intracellular metabolites

Data - which included both the nature and amounts of
metabolites - were taken from [34,35], [32,33], [66], and
[7]. The amounts of Coenzyme A thioesters were determined by P. Kiefer (unpublished data). The content in
tetra-aminoptherin and related cofactors were obtained
from [7,66]. The contents in other cofactors were calculated from that in E.coli [64], using appropriate
corrections.

non-growth associated maintenance energy, i.e. 1.9

function.

viii) Inorganic ions

The amounts of inorganic ions were calculated from
that in E.coli [64], using appropriate corrections.
The complete details of the biomass composition of
M. extorquens, as they result from the above investigations or calculations, are given in Additional file 4.

The distribution of metabolic fluxes during methylotrophic growth was determined from 13C-labeling data
collected during steady-state growth of M. extorquens
on [13C]-methanol. The distribution of 13C-isotopomers
in metabolites can be accurately determined by NMR or
MS [45,68,69], alone or in combination [19]. Here the
13
C-isotopomers of proteinogenic amino-acids were
measured by the two methods. NMR spectra were monitored as described in [19] and LC-MS analysis were
performed using Rheos 2200 HPLC system (Flux Instruments) coupled to an LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific), equipped with an electrospray ionization probe and the amino acid were separated on a pHILIC column (150 × 2.0 mm, particle size
5 μm; Sequant, Umea, Sweden), following a procedure
described [34]. A total of 193 isotopomer data - including 137 NMR data plus 56 MS data - were collected
(Additional file 12). The metabolic network considered
for flux calculations contained 65 reactions - including 7
reversible reactions - describing M. extorquens central
metabolism, according to the topology of the methylotrophic network (Additional file 17). Flux calculations
were performed using the software 13C-Flux [70], which
uses both mass balances and carbon atom transitions to
describe the metabolic. The methanol uptake rate and
the requirements in biomass precursors, determined
from data in Additional file 4, 11, were constrained. The
confidence on the measured fluxes was determined
using the sensitivity analysis module of 13C-Flux.
Results were expressed as absolute fluxes in mmol.g-1.h1
+/- standard deviations.

Cultivation and labeling experiment

Batch cultivations (three biological replicates) of M.
extorquens AM1 were carried out at 28°C in minimal
medium, in a bioreactor (Infors-HT, Bottmingen, Switzerland), as described previously [19]. Cultivations carried out for the purpose of steady-state [13C]-methanol
experiments were performed like in [19]. The cultivations were aerated with 5% natural labeled CO 2 to
remove the 13CO2 produced by the bacteria from [13C]methanol. Under this condition, only 4.6 ± 0.4% of total
CO2 was found to derive from [13C]-methanol oxidation.
In silico calculations

The metabolic network - containing 1139 (m) reactions
977 (n) metabolites - was converted into a mathematical
model corresponding to a m × n matrix defining the
stoichiometric coefficient of reactions. Calculations of
steady-state fluxes were performed using the software
CellNetAnlyser [25] and Matlab (Mathworks, Inc.). Flux
Balance Analysis (FBA) calculations were performed
using various objective functions, as indicated in the
text. Despite the genome annotation revealed the occurrence of a potential photosynthetic machinery, all calculations were performed assuming that no photosynthesis
operated since no phototrophic behavior was reported
for M. extorquens. Calculation of EFMs in the methylotrophic network was performed using the solver EFMTool [67]. They were calculated assuming no
maintenance energy. To be compared with experimental
data, the obtain biomass yields (Y) of the EFMs were
calculated as following:
µmax
1000
Y = q ×µ
×
si

MWs
+ NGAMs

With μmax: theoretical maximum growth rate (calculated to be 0.201 for the methylotrophic network from

network. The graph displays the essentiality or dispensability of reactions
and showx the experimental evidence for gene essentiality. Reaction
essentiality was analyzed using Minimal Cut Set calculation [42] applied
to the set of EFMs [30] allowing biomass production from methanol.
Fragility Coefficients (FCs) were calculated from the MCSs [42]. Reactions
having a FC of 1 were identified as essential (red arrows), and reactions
with a FC < 1 were considered as dispensable (blue arrows). The enzyme
(s) catalyzing the network reactions are represented by boxes. The
experimental phenotypes of mutants affected for these enzymes are
displayed using a color code: red box: lethal phenotype, blue box: nonlethal phenotype, black box: no experimental data available. The

were normalized by the flux of entry of the C1-units in central
metabolism (SHMT: serine hydroxymethyltransferase). Flux distributions
were found to be similar except slight changes through the C3/C4
interconversions (pyruvate kinase (PK), pyruvate dikynase (PPDK), malic
enzyme (ME) and the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK)), and
through the Entner-Doudorof pathway.
