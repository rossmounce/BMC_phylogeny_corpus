Abstract
Background: The number of completely sequenced plastid genomes available is growing rapidly. This
array of sequences presents new opportunities to perform comparative analyses. In comparative studies,
it is often useful to compare across wide phylogenetic spans and, within angiosperms, to include
representatives from basally diverging lineages such as the genomes reported here: Nuphar advena (from
a basal-most lineage) and Ranunculus macranthus (a basal eudicot). We report these two new plastid
genome sequences and make comparisons (within angiosperms, seed plants, or all photosynthetic lineages)
to evaluate features such as the status of ycf15 and ycf68 as protein coding genes, the distribution of simple
sequence repeats (SSRs) and longer dispersed repeats (SDR), and patterns of nucleotide composition.
Results: The Nuphar [GenBank:NC_008788] and Ranunculus [GenBank:NC_008796] plastid genomes
share characteristics of gene content and organization with many other chloroplast genomes. Like other
plastid genomes, these genomes are A+T-rich, except for rRNA and tRNA genes. Detailed comparisons
of Nuphar with Nymphaea, another Nymphaeaceae, show that more than two-thirds of these genomes
exhibit at least 95% sequence identity and that most SSRs are shared. In broader comparisons, SSRs vary
among genomes in terms of abundance and length and most contain repeat motifs based on A and T
nucleotides.
Conclusion: SSR and SDR abundance varies by genome and, for SSRs, is proportional to genome size.
Long SDRs are rare in the genomes assessed. SSRs occur less frequently than predicted and, although the
majority of the repeat motifs do include A and T nucleotides, the A+T bias in SSRs is less than that
predicted from the underlying genomic nucleotide composition. In codon usage third positions show an
A+T bias, however variation in codon usage does not correlate with differences in A+T-richness. Thus,
although plastome nucleotide composition shows "A+T richness", an A+T bias is not apparent upon more
in-depth analysis, at least in these aspects. The pattern of evolution in the sequences identified as ycf15 and
ycf68 is not consistent with them being protein-coding genes. In fact, these regions show no evidence of
sequence conservation beyond what is normal for non-coding regions of the IR.

Background
In this paper we report the complete chloroplast genome
sequences of the angiosperms Nuphar advena (Nymphaeaceae) and Ranunculus macranthus (Ranunculaceae). The
Nymphaeaceae is placed very near or even at the base of
extant angiosperms [1-6], whereas the Ranunculus chloroplast genome represents the basal-most eudicot characterized to date [4,5]. Thus we add to the small number of
genomes not representing monocots or crown eudicots,
increasing our ability to compare genomes across all
angiosperms and determine general characteristics. Most
chloroplast genomes in angiosperms (reviewed in: [7-9])
range from 135 to 160 kb and exist, at least in part [10] as
single genome circles. In the majority of angiosperm chloroplast genomes two copies of a large inverted repeat (IR)
of about 25 kb separate the remainder of the genome into
two regions of unique DNA, the large (about 90 kb) and
small (about 20 kb) single copy regions (LSC and SSC,
respectively). Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), the first completely sequenced chloroplast genome [11], is most frequently used to contrast features of newly studied
angiosperm cpDNAs and is parsimoniously inferred to
represent the ancestral (or at least consensus) angiosperm
chloroplast genome in terms of gene content and organization [7,8]. This is reinforced by the similarity of the
tobacco cpDNA to the basal angiosperms, Amborella [12]
and Nymphaea [13], and the magnolids, Calycanthus
[14]Drimys, Liriodendron, and Piper [6]. In some derived
angiosperm lineages, this ancestral condition has been
somewhat or highly modified via inversions, gene losses,
presence or absence of ORFs and minor ycfs, and changes
in IR extent [8,9,15,16]. However, the tobacco-like pattern
is widely distributed in crown eudicots, e.g., Panax [17],
Eucalyptus [18], and Gossypium [19].
Comparative chloroplast genomics as well as detailed
characterizations of individual chloroplast genomes serve
as the basis for functional genomic studies [20] and can
direct attempts at chloroplast transformation for genetic
engineering [21]. In addition the chloroplast genome is
an important source of genetic markers for phylogenetic
analysis, population-level studies, genotyping and mapping that can be further exploited with additional
genomic characterization and comparison. Detailed comparisons of genomic sequence have the potential, for
example, to identify functional sequence outside of coding regions (promoters, terminators, replication origins,
etc.), test the reality of hypothetical protein coding
regions, make inferences about mutational rates and
mechanisms, and detect selective signatures in gene
sequences. Many fundamental aspects of the chloroplast
genome are poorly understood and incompletely
described. Here we use genomic comparisons to investigate the likelihood that ycf15 and ycf68 are not proteincoding genes, the occurrence of microsatellites or simple

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/174

sequence repeats (SSRs), the presence of somewhat larger
more complex repeats or small disperse repeats (SDR) and
how nucleotide composition contributes to patterns of
genome organization such as codon usage and repeat
structure.

Results and Discussion
Genomic characteristics, including IR extent
Both the Nuphar [GenBank:NC_008788] and Ranunculus
[GenBank:NC_008796] genomes exhibit the quadripartite structure common to most land plant genomes with
large and small single copy regions (LSC and SSC, respectively) separated by two copies of the IR. The Nuphar chloroplast genome (Figure 1) is 160,866 bp in total length;
the LSC is 90,379 bp, the SSC 18,817 bp and the two IR
copies each 25,835 bp in length. In Ranunculus (Figure 2),
the overall length is 155,129 bp with a LSC of 84,638 bp,
a SSC of 18,909 bp, and two IR regions each of 25,791 bp.
As is common to chloroplast genomes in general [5,6,9],
the nucleotide composition of both of these genomes are
biased towards A and T nucleotides, i.e., they are "A+Trich". Overall the Nuphar genome is 60.9% A+T and
Ranunculus 62.1% A+T. Different regions of the genome
vary in A+T content, but all partitions are A+T rich with
the exception of the two classes of RNA genes (Table 1).

Although the two copies of the IR were not sequenced
independently, the identity of the two copies could still be
assessed. All random reads generated from the two IR
regions falsely assemble in one location, but presumably
about half of the reads are sequenced from one copy of the
repeat and half from the other. If the two copies varied in
sequence, one would expect, on average, half the reads to
reflect one variant and half the other, but all reads that
assembled into this region for both Nuphar and Ranunculus were identical in sequence. In fact, throughout the
entire cpDNA of Nuphar, only one case of potential heteroplasmy was observed, where four reads indicated a run
of 10 As and four others indicated 11. In Ranunculus no
cases of high quality mismatch involving more than a single read were detected, even though multiple individuals
contributed to the sequencing template. Nucleotide polymorphisms in chloroplast DNA sequences have been
detected in several other groups. In the completely
sequenced Pelargonium genome [16], 11 polymorphisms
were detected and nine of these were located in the LSC.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to determine if the differences in Nuphar or Pelargonium represent heteroplasmy because multiple individuals were used in both
studies. Heteroplasmy in the chloroplast genome has
been detected in several other groups, including rice [22],
Medicago [23], and Senecio [24].
The IR extent in Nuphar and Ranunculus, as well as those
of the basal angiosperms sequenced by Goremykin et al

sequencing effort by PCR amplification and sequencing of
the boundary regions. Although all these genomes contain IRs similar in extent to those of Nicotiana and many

other angiosperms, some minor modifications were
detected (Figure 3). As is common among angiosperms, a
complete copy of ycf1 spans the SSC/IRA junction and the
5'end of the gene is duplicated at the SSC end of IRb.

Among the comparisons shown in Figure 3, the amount
of ycf1 that is duplicated ranges from 156 bp in Nymphaea
to 1,583 bp in Amborella. At the LSC end of the IR, there is
variation in these taxa over whether and how much of the
gene trnH is duplicated. No part of trnH is duplicated in
Calycanthus or Nicotiana but amounts ranging from one
bp in Nymphaea to the entire gene (plus 140 bp of IGS) in
Nuphar have been incorporated into the IR. The trnH gene
has also been incorporated in the IR of Drimys but not in
the other two recently sequenced magnoliid genomes, Liriodendron, and Piper [6]. Large or complex changes in the
extent of the IR should make distinctive markers of evolutionary lineages [25,26]. However, given the small size of
the changes discussed here and the relative ease of small
(~100 bp) movements of the IR boundaries [27], the
amount of ycf1 duplicated and the migration of trnH relative to the IR would not make very reliable phylogenetic
markers.

in spinach [29]. They concluded that the ycf15 sequence,
since it is highly conserved, probably has functional significance but probably does not code for a protein. Using
an alternative approach, Goremykin et al [14] compared
nucleotide substitution rates (dN/dS) in ycf15 and found
a ratio that suggests ycf15 is not a protein evolving under
evolutionary constraint.

Gene content, including ycf15 and ycf68
The gene content and arrangement of Nuphar and Ranunculus plastid genomes (Figs. 1, 2) are identical with each
other and with Nymphaea, Calycanthus, Amborella and
Nicotiana (among others) except for details of the IR
extent (described above), whether or not infA occurs as a
pseudogene (in Ranunculus and Nicotiana) or a functional
copy (the others listed), and the nature of ycf15 and ycf68
(see below). Seventy-nine different protein-coding genes
(including, in this count, four hypothetical genes, ycf1,
ycf2, ycf3, and ycf4), four rRNA genes and 30 tRNA genes
occur in these genomes. Eighteen of these genes contain
introns including two genes, clpP and ycf3, each with two
introns, and one gene, rps12, also composed of three
exons, but with the 5' exon separated from the two 3'
exons. These features are common characteristics of land
plant chloroplast genomes [9,28].

We examined the ycf2:trnL spacer region, where ycf15 is
located, in several chloroplast genomes, including Nuphar
and Ranunculus, to determine the distribution and nature
of ycf15 (Table 2). Schmitz-Linneweber et al. [29], based
on their small sample of taxa, suggested that the distribution of the interrupted versus uninterrupted ycf15
sequence, whether or not the sequence codes for a protein, might have phylogenetic significance. That indeed
appears to be the case; all taxa, among those we examined,
that contain an uninterrupted ycf15 motif are asterids and
no asterid has the interrupted form (although some lack
the 5' portion of the motif). We assume, based on the
sequence similarity of the intervening sequence, that the
Schmitz-Linneweber et al. [29] finding of lack of splicing
in Spinacia is likely to hold for other interrupted forms of
the motif. The existence of the widely distributed interrupted form suggests that this is not a protein-coding gene
in any of these genomes. If this truly is a protein-coding
gene in the asterids, we would have to imagine that pseudogenes (as the interrupted forms would be, see Figure 4)
are being retained, conserved over broad evolutionary distances, and either that the active form was inactivated
multiple times by the insertion of the same intervening
sequence at the same location or that an inactivated gene
was re-activated in the asterids through the excision of the
intervening sequence. Thus, we concur that ycf15 is
unlikely to represent a protein-coding gene and so we did
not annotate the sequence in either genome.

The hypothetical gene ycf15 was first identified as ORF87
in Nicotiana [11] and has been included in the annotation
of a subset of the completed land plant genomes. However, the validity of ycf15 as a protein-coding gene has
been questioned [14,18,29]. Schmitz-Linneweber et al
[29] found that the plastomes of Nicotiana, Epifagus and
Cuscuta contain intact copies of ycf15, whereas those of
Spinacia and Arabidopsis contain ycf15 as two pieces, with
the 5' and 3' sections separated by 250–300 bp of 'intervening sequence'. They reasoned that if ycf15 is a functional protein in spinach, then the intervening sequence
would need to be removed and the 5' and 3' sections
spliced in order to make a functional ycf15 mature transcript. If the intervening sequence were not removed,
numerous in-frame stop codons would lead to a truncated
protein (Figure 4). Reverse transcription experiments in
spinach determined that ycf15 was not spliced (although
it was transcribed) and so presumably was not translated

Similarly a second hypothetical protein-coding gene,
ycf68, also may not code for a protein. This conserved
motif has been reported in the trnI-GAU intron of rice
(ORF133), corn (ORF133), Pinus (ORF75a), Eucalyptus
(ORF113) and Nymphaea. Wheat and sugarcane also contain an ORF in this region apparently homologous to that
of rice and corn [30]. We did not find an equivalent
sequence in the chloroplast genome of any alga, which all
lack an intron in the trnI-GAU gene, or in Selaginella,
which lacks the trnI-GAU gene (Table 3). In the plastid
genomes of all other vascular plant taxa examined, a similar sequence occurs in the trnI intron but in the majority
of cases it contains numerous frameshifts and stop codons
(Figure 5). Based only on its length and lack of internal
stop codons, the ycf68 sequence could represent a functional protein-coding gene in the grasses, Nymphaeales,
and in the gymnosperms Pinus thunbergii and P. koraiensis.
However, in the others it can only be, at most, a pseudog-

junctions. In Calycanthus rpl2 is not in the IR. JSB occurs within ycf1 in all of the genomes but the amount of the 5' end of ycf1
that is duplicated ranges from 156 bp in Nymphaea to 1583 bp in Amborella. Eleven bp of ndhF is duplicated in Nuphar but none
of the other genomes shown have any duplication of the gene. JLA varies from including 5 bp of spacer downstream of trnH in
Nicotiana to the inclusion of trnH and an additional 140 bp upstream sequence in the IR in Nuphar.

Alignment of the ycf15 region in six representative angiosperms

ene. Again, it seems unlikely that a non-functional gene
could remain as conserved as the motif seen here over
such vast evolutionary distances. If the sequence has any
functional significance it must be other than coding for a
protein, for example, in intron excision or in gene regulation. We did attempt to detect relationships between the
conserved ycf68 motif and folding of the intron without
success (see methods). We did not include ycf68 in the
annotation of either Nuphar or Ranunculus.
To further investigate the properties of these two "ycfs" we
applied two additional approaches: 1) graphing codon
usage patterns, following Echols et al. [31], of these putative genes relative to that of known genes and non-coding
regions; and 2) comparing the level of conservation in the
ycf15- and ycf68-containing regions with other similar
regions using Mulan [32]. Codon usage results were
ambiguous (data not shown, see Methods). The Mulan
results, though intuitive, were instructive (Figure 6). We
compared the ycf15-containing intergenic spacer as well as
five other similarly sized IGS (two from the IR regions and
three from the LSC) to the homologous regions in Nicotiana, for each of 14 genomes (Figure 6 top). For ycf68, we

did similar comparisons, using Zea as the reference taxon,
of the trnI-GAU (ycf68-containing) intron, two other
introns from the IR and three introns from the LSC (Figure
6 bottom). In both cases, but especially for the intron
(ycf68) comparison, it can be seen that other IGS or intron
sequences are as (or even more) conserved as the ycf
regions and that non-coding sequences (introns or IGS)
are much more conserved in the IR than in the LSC. Thus,
it is seems likely that these regions (ycf15 and ycf68) are
conserved, not because they serve some function, but simply because they are in the inverted repeat; they simply
appear to code for a polypeptide chain of suggestive
length due to chance and are conserved across large evolutionary distances because of the especially low rates of
change within the IR [33].
Codon Usage
We examined codon usage patterns in Nuphar and Ranunculus for the 79 protein-coding genes (i.e., not including
the hypothetical genes, ycf15 and ycf68). We compared
start codon usage in ten representative genomes being
careful to compare homologous positions as much as possible. [This was straightforward among seed plants but

sometimes problematic with Huperzia.] For five genes in
each organism (with some but not all genes held in common), either ACG or GTG appear to be used as an alternative to ATG as the start codon, as is common for a variety
of genes in the plastid genomes of seed plants (Table 4).
In the pteridophytes, Huperzia (Table 4) and Adiantum
[34], even more genes (10 and 26, respectively) use alternative start codons, and the pteridophyte repertoire
includes GCG and ATT, in addition to ACG and GTG.
Overall codon usage in the Nuphar and Ranunculus
genomes (Table 5) is generally similar to that reported
from other genomes such as Panax [17], Lotus [35] and
Nicotiana [36]. As in these and other genomes [5,6,36-38]
where the genetic code is redundant, codons with a third
position nucleotide of A or T(U) are used more frequently
than those terminating in G or C (Table 5). The base composition at each of the three codon positions varies, with
the first position having the lowest proportion of A+T and
the third position the highest (Table 1). It has been suggested that codon usage patterns are driven by this composition bias [39,40]. However, when we apply methods
to assess the impact of nucleotide composition on codon

usage within Nuphar and Ranunculus, it appears that the
A+T-richness of the third position is at most a partial
influence on codon usage. We used CodonW [41] to calculate a variety of codon usage statistics that we then contrasted graphically (Figure 7). COrrespondence Analysis
of codon usage (COA) was calculated based on codon
usage as well as Relative Synonymous Codon Usage
(RSCU). In each case the first two axes together explained
only a modest amount of the variation (15–20%) and
plotting each of the 56 degenerate codons on the first and
second axes did not produce a pattern related to the A+Trichness of the third position in the codon sequence (Figure 7 top), except that codons ending in A or T are more
tightly clustered than the codons ending in G or C. These
results suggest that A+T-richness is not the most important factor in explaining variation in codon use. In addition we graphed each gene on the two axes ENc (the
effective number of codons) and GC3 (the G+C percentage at the third position) (Figure 7 middle). If codon
usage is random with respect to factors other than A+Trichness (i.e., GC content) of the third position, each gene
is expected to fall on the prediction line for ENc based
solely on its GC3 value [42,43]. Again our results reinforce

Alignment of the ycf68 region in 14 representative angiosperms
Figure 5
Alignment of the ycf68 region in 14 representative angiosperms. Amborella, Nuphar, Zea, and Spinacia represent the form that
includes intervening sequence. Codons highlighted in green represent start codons as annotated in the published grass
genomes (Zea, Saccharum, Oryza and Triticum) and Nymphaea. Gorymekin et al identified a later start codon in their annotation
of the Nymphaea ycf68 in order to maintain an open reading frame. Codons highlighted in red represent in frame stop codons
(in frame with the grass start codon in the initial part of the alignment and in frame with the Nymphaea start codon once that
point is reached). In either frame, these sequences, although largely conserved at the nucleotide level, are not open in most
taxa.

Sequence similarity comparisons of IGS and introns within the IR and the LSC
Sequence similarity comparisons of IGS and introns within the IR and the LSC. In both the top and bottom section, each 14
pairwise Mulan alignments is displayed as a histogram showing the similiarity (ranging from 50% to 100%) between each taxon
(A-N) and the reference (Nicotiana top or Zea bottom). The height of the blue histogram topped by the horizontal black lines
indicates the degree of similarity; similarity histograms are blue except where we have re-colored yellow the regions equivalent
to ycf15 (top) and ycf68 (bottom) to highlight those regions. [The black horizontal lines without blue bars subtending them
indicate short regions of similarity, basically SDRs. Red bars above the histogram indicate evolutionary conserved regions as
determined in Mulan.] In interpreting the diagram, essentially the more blue (or yellow) in a region, the more similar are the
two sequences. (Top) Comparisons, relevant to the conservation of ycf15, of six IGS regions from Nicotiana tobaccum were

Pseudogenes and ORFs were not included. Dashes in a cell indicate that that gene is absent from that genome.

the finding that factors other than nucleotide composition are operating in the plastid genome to select among
synonymous codons across genes, in that most points do
not fall on the prediction line. Other studies, for example
Wall and Herbeck's study of codon bias in the plastid gene
rbcL [44], also have found that codon usage patterns are
not explained by G+C patterns. Finally, we calculated
COA eigen values for each gene for the Nuphar or Ranunculus genome (based on codon usage, RSCU or amino
acid usage, the results are comparable although more
obvious for codon or amino acid usage). The eigen values
for the primary axes are higher (explain a higher proportion of the variation) than those seen for codons (about
25% in the case of the codon usage analyses) and plotting
each gene on the first two axes produces patterns (Figure
7 bottom) suggesting that different functional groups of
genes have different codon usage and amino acid usage
patterns as has been found in broader comparisons
[6,36]. Overall, although A+T-richness of the third position is the most obvious pattern observable in plastome
codon usage, other factors are important in determining
codon usage patterns in particular genes (and perhaps
genomes).
Comparisons of Nuphar and Nymphaea
Between the Nuphar and Nymphaea chloroplast genomes,
we compared each individual gene, intron or intergenic
spacer (IGS) region and calculated percent similarity
(Table 6, Figure 1). For summary calculations, only one
copy of each region in the IR was included and identities
for multiple introns within a single gene were calculated
separately. More than two-thirds of Nuphar regions match
the homologous region of Nymphaea at a similarity level

of 95% or higher; only 3% of the genomes fell below a
threshold of 70% identity. As expected, coding regions are
more highly conserved than IGS on average, although not
in all cases. All four genes for rRNAs are 100% identical
and those for tRNAs have at least 95% identity. Three protein-coding genes are 90–94% identical and all others are
at least 95% identical. In some cases IGS and introns are
more similar than coding regions – 60% of introns and
41% of IGS are at least 95% identical in sequence between
the two genomes. Interestingly, the distribution patterns
of the numbers of IGS and the numbers of introns in the
different percent identity categories appeared quite similar, suggesting that similar forces may impact both types
of non-coding sequences.
Detailed percent identity comparisons are rarely reported
for individual regions of entire chloroplast genomes. One
study compared sugar cane with rice, maize and wheat
and reported comparisons as one of three categories: 0–
30%, 31–79% and 80–100% [45]. As one might expect,
most of the regions fell into the latter category. Timme et
al. [46] compared sequence divergence in both coding
and non-coding regions between two completely
sequenced chloroplast genomes from representatives of
two of the subfamilies of Asteraceae. Their results showed
that intergenic spacer regions were nearly two times as
divergent as introns, and that the 10 most divergent coding sequences represent several different functional
groups, including photosynthetic genes, ribosomal proteins, and ndh genes. Another study compared divergence
within functional groups across four different species in
three genera of Solanaceae and found that RNA and
photosynthesis genes are the most conserved [47], con-

sistent with the results from a second Solanceae comparison based on individual coding regions [48]. Kim and Lee
[17], in their comparison of coding regions (omitting the
tRNA genes) from 16 fully sequenced vascular plant chloroplast genomes, found the four rRNA genes to be the
least divergent, followed by psbA, psbD, rps12, psbE, psbL
and petB. The most conserved coding regions in NupharNymphaea are similar in that the four rRNA genes, rps12,
psbL and petB are also among the most conservative genes
but differ in including petN, psbM, and rpl23 among the 10
most conserved coding regions.
We also examined indels (insertions and deletions)
between Nuphar and Nymphaea which, of course, are
much more likely to occur in IGS than in coding regions.
In our study, 88.6% of insertions and 89.9% of deletions
occurred in IGS (data not shown), comparable to results
from a similar comparison between sugarcane and maize
where 84.9% of insertions and 74.2% of deletions
occurred in IGS [45]. In another study, the comparison of
two varieties of rice (Oryza sativa) found 110 indels
between those two plastid genomes [49], whereas we
found almost four times as many (413), but, of course,
our taxa are less closely related. However a study comparing Atropa belladonna to Nicotiana tabaccum, a comparison
perhaps more comparable to ours, found 65 insertions
and 60 deletions equal to or larger than five bp in intergenic regions and introns [50], whereas we found 163
insertions and 206 deletions in Nuphar relative to Nymphaea. Together the combined lengths of the indels
account for 0.08% of the total genome length of Atropa
and 0.08% of the genome length in the rice comparison,
but 0.23% of the genomic length in the Nuphar-Nymphaea
comparison.

Only recently have plastome sequences been available for
closely related taxa, allowing for detailed comparisons
[46-48]. These comparisons suggest that non-coding
sequences within the genome evolve more rapidly in
terms of both substitution and indel mutations, although
this is not universally so (some non-coding sequences are
quite highly conserved). Comparisons across studies
show that some regions are consistently slow to evolve
and others commonly evolve at a higher rate but at least
minor differences are seen across these studies. Before
general patterns and processes can be identified more
genomic data allowing for such comparisons will need to
become available.
Repeat Analysis – Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs)
We screened for perfect SSRs in Nuphar, Ranunculus and 24
other chloroplast genomes (Table 7). We report the
number of mononucleotide repeats ≥ 8 nt, dinucleotide
repeats ≥ 8 nt (i.e., four repeat units), and trinucleotide
repeats ≥ 9 nt (i.e., three repeat units); hereafter referred to
collectively as the 8,8,9 SSRs. We also report the number
of longer repeats ≥ 10 nt/repeats for mononucleotide
runs, ≥ 10 nt (or five copies of the repeat unit) for dinucleotide repeats, and ≥ 12 nt (i.e., four copies of the repeat
unit) for trinucleotide repeats; referred to collectively as
the 10,10,12 SSRs. Of course, any particular threshold
(e.g., 8,8,9) is rather arbitrary and no consensus has developed on what nucleotide length or repeat unit number is
significant [51]. However, it has been suggested that SSRs
of length 8 nt or more (regardless of repeat motif) are
prone to slip-strand mispairing (SSM, thought to be the
primary mutational mechanism to affect SSRs), whereas
those of lesser length are not [52]. Elsewhere the critical
threshold is estimated at 7–10 bp [53]. Other workers

have chosen similar thresholds, of 8 or 10 nt, in their
reports [e.g., [54]]. The number of 8,8,9 SSRs vary from
152 in Pinus thunbergii to 393 in Lotus and comprise
between 1 and 2.5% of the chloroplast genome. The
number of 10,10,12 SSRs range from 16 in one of the rice
genomes to 113 in Medicago.
We calculated, based on the data presented in Table 7,
Spearman Rank Correlation statistics [using [55]] to look
for relationships between the number of short and long
SSRs and between genome size and the total number of
SSRs (Figure 8). If some genomes are generally more likely
to contain SSRs (due to differences in mutational biases or
selection pressures or other factors) and a common mechanism (or suite of mechanisms) controlled the likelihood
of SSR presence, then a correlation between short and
long SSRs would be predicted. Alternatively if some
genomes were predisposed to long SSRs whereas others
were less likely for SSRs to attain greater length, then no
correlation might be seen or even a negative correlation
might be observed. Genome size and total number of
SSRs should be correlated if SSRs occur randomly. Both
these comparisons showed a small but significant positive
relationship. Genomes with a higher number of "short"
SSRs (from the first to the second threshold) were more
likely to have a higher number of "long" SSRs (at or above
the second threshold) – Figure 8 (top), rs = 0.534, p =
0.009. Larger genomes were more likely to contain more
SSRs than smaller genomes – Figure 8 (middle), rs = 0.542,
p = 0.008 (rs = 0.524, p = 0.012 with Epifagus excluded).
Thus we can infer that the larger the genome the more
SSRs are to be expected and that "long" and "short" SSRs
most likely are simply points on a continuum evolving
under similar mechanisms. However these two factors
explain only a portion of the variance in SSR number.
For a subset of the chloroplast genomes, we conducted a
more detailed comparison of the SSRs (data shown in
additional file 1), including all of the then available basal
angiosperms and basal eudicots, plus a pteridophyte, a
conifer, two derived eudicots and one monocot. In these
comparisons we characterized repeats based on nucleotide composition in addition to length and number. We

then compared (data not shown) the predicted and
observed number of repeats of various types and the predicted and observed ratios between repeats of various
compositions. For all types of repeats, of all lengths and
all compositions, in all genomes, fewer SSRs were
observed than were predicted. In many cases the difference between the number of SSRs predicted and the
number observed was more than an order of magnitude.
For mononucleotide repeats in most angiosperms, the
ratio of A or T (W) containing runs to G or C (S) containing runs was not significantly different from the ratio predicted from the genomic base composition. However, in
the two Nymphaeaceae (Nuphar and Nymphaea), Pinus
and Huperzia, the observed ratio of W to S mononucleotide SSRs was significantly different from the predicted
ratio (Chi-Square test, p < 0.001). Interestingly the
observed ratio was skewed in favor of S (G and C) containing repeats. When predicted ratios of dinucleotide repeats
were calculated based on the overall nucleotide composition, all genomes showed a significantly biased ratio (Chisquare test, p < 0.001). In this case more WS SSRs were
observed than expected and fewer WW SSRs. When the
dinucleotide calculations were repeated based on the
genomic dinucleotide frequencies, the deviation of the
observed from the expected was less and for Arabidopsis
and Triticum was not significant. Again where there is a
deviation from expected, the WS category is elevated and
the WW category is reduced in the observed. Finally, in
calculations related to trinucleotide SSR compositions
and based on overall trinucleotide composition, all but
Arabidopsis and Triticum showed biased compositional
ratios. Bias was due primarily to fewer WWW SSRs than
expected. Thus, surprisingly, whenever the observed compositional ratio of SSRs was different from expectation
(the majority of cases), the deviation was due to a deficiency of W (A and T) containing repeats.
Other (non-plastid) genomes that are A+T rich have been
found to exhibit a strong overrepresentation of A or T
mononucleotide SSRs, e.g., Caenorhabditis elegans [56] and
Plasmodium falciparum [53] and various explanations for
this have been offered. Because A-T base pairs are held
together by two hydrogen bonds rather than three, A-T

containing repeats are easier to denature and therefore
perhaps more prone to slip-strand mispairing (SSM).
Other explanations include mutational bias (i.e., G-C to
A-T mutations being more likely than the reverse [56]),
involvement of A-T runs in gene regulation [53], and
regions being more mutagenic due to A-T runs (this
increased mutability being selected for in regions where
higher mutations rates would be advantageous [56,57]).
Although these proposals seem reasonable, SSRs (and
specifically A and T containing SSRs) are underrepresented in the plastid genomes in contrast also to the work
of Dieringer and Schlotterer [58] who found SSRs overrepresented when comparing nine nuclear genomes. They
predicted that the more biased from equal nucleotide
composition the genome the greater the density of microsatellites (either mono- or di- nucleotide SSRs in their
case). For the genomes considered in our detailed comparison, we tested for correlation between various aspects
of nucleotide composition and SSR frequency. Only A and
T mononucleotide repeat density correlated with genomic
nucleotide composition (Figure 8 bottom, rs = 0.81, p =
0.015). So this correlation can be seen even when the W
repeats are not over represented. G and C mononucleotide repeat density did not correlate with nucleotide

composition and di- and tri-nucleotide repeat densities
correlated neither with genomic frequencies nor with dior tri-nucleotide frequencies calculated over the entire
genome (data not shown). We note that GpC and CpG
based (SS) repeats are completely absent from all the plastid genomes examined. This may be the result of selection
against these motifs in addition to simple nucleotide
composition (these would be predicted to be very rare;
about one SS repeat of length 8 nt per genome on average)
as SS-based dinucleotide repeats are absent or strongly
underrepresented in other genomes as well [51,58,59].
Presumably some mechanism (mutational or selectional)
in the chloroplast genome is acting on the plastid
genomes such that many fewer SSRs are observed than
would be expected and that mechanism is acting more
strongly on W-containing repeats than S-containing ones.
In an alternative attempt to clarify underlying patterns
and mechanisms of SSR evolution, we compared the
10,10,12 SSRs between Nuphar and Nymphaea to determine how many of the SSRs were shared (determined by
identity of flanking sequence and repeat position as well
as repeat motif) between these two genomes from relatively closely related plants (additional file 2). The Nuphar

Page 16 of 27
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:174

genome contains more than twice as many 10,10,12 SSRs
as the Nymphaea genome – 52 in Nuphar, 23 in Nymphaea.
Sixty-six different 10,10,12 SSRs occur in the combined
set. The vast majority, but not all, of the SSRs occur in
non-coding DNA (55 in IGS, six in introns, and five in
coding regions). The majority (50 of 66) of these repeats
are shared between the two genomes; most are simply
lower than the reporting threshold in one genome or the
other. Of the 50 shared SSRs, only seven are the same
length in both genomes. Where the shared SSRs are of different lengths, in 18 cases length differences were due to
SSM, in 14 cases due to a nucleotide substitution, in four
cases due to an indel (a length mutation other than a
change in repeat unit number) and in eight cases due to a
combination of mechanisms. Of the 16 SSRs not shared,
14 were found only in Nuphar and only two in Nymphaea.
Thus, it appears that Nuphar is more likely to have these
SSRs and for the SSRs to be longer when they occur; in 30
of the 43 cases where shared repeats differ in length the
Nuphar SSR is longer.
It is thought that SSRs begin as random runs of nucleotides [51,60]. Any bias in mutation patterns or nucleotide
composition would make certain runs more likely. Then,
once present in a location, the repeat would grow via SSM
[51,57,58,60]. Longer SSRs lead to more stable heteroduplex intermediates, making SSM more likely [57]. However longer SSRs also have higher mutations rates [51].
One model of SSR evolution posits that the distribution of
repeat lengths in a genome represents an equilibrium
between SSM and point mutation [51]. In the NupharNymphaea comparison SSM and point mutation occur
with about equal frequency, consistent with this hypothesis. In terms of phylogenetic utility of SSR variation,
the Nuphar-Nymphaea comparison suggests that individual SSRs are stable at least over relatively short periods of
evolutionary time and that they do commonly vary in
repeat number. However the small size of most repeats
probably limits their utility and more needs to be known
about the specifics of SSR evolution before any phylogenetic utility can be fully realized. Understanding more
about the processes of SSR evolution will also help us
investigate possible selective or functional roles for these
motifs.
Repeat Analysis – Small Dispersed Repeats (SDR)
We also searched for SDRs in the plastomes of representative angiosperms. These repeats are based on a more
complex motif and are longer than SSRs. Our SDR analysis, within each of the eight genomes, identified 114–350
direct and inverted repeats 30 bp or longer with a
sequence identity of at least 80% (Figure 9). The number
of repeats was lowest in Nymphaea (114) and highest in
Arabidopsis (350). In most cases, the number of direct
repeats (62–208) was substantially higher than the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/174

number of inverted repeats (32–142). The vast majority
(84–97%) of the repeats were only 30–40 bp in length
and the longest repeat was 193 bp in Triticum.
Blast comparisons of the repeats identified in each of the
genomes were performed against all other genomes to
locate shared repeats with an e-value of 2. Although these
comparisons were performed using the repeats in each of
the eight genomes as the reference, we only present the
results (Table 8) using Nymphaea as the reference genome
because it had the fewest number of repeats and thus
would contain any repeats shared throughout all these
genomes. Overall, the analyses identified 83 groups of
shared repeats among these eight angiosperm chloroplast
genomes, ranging in length from 30 to 49 bp. The majority of the shared repeats were located within intergenic
spacer regions and introns. However repeats were sometimes found within genes and some cases represented
inter-tRNA similarities within different families of tRNA
genes. The largest shared repeat (49 bp) represents shared
sequence between psaA and psaB. In general, the longer
shared SDRs (36 – 49 bp) tend to have lower A+T-richness
(at the level of the genome or lower). However, most (68
of the 83) of the shared SDRs are short, between 30 and
32 nt in length. This class of SDRs shows the widest range
in A+T-richness (29% to 97%) but most exhibit A+T-richness of greater than 50%. Most shared SDRs are present in
only a small number of copies. Only two repeats occur
more than four times in the genomes (both are found in
introns and IGS and exhibit A+T richness less than that of
the genomes overall); one is 42 nt long (51% AT) and the
other, occurring about 10 times, is 40 nt long (54% AT).
Overall, no trends were detected between repeat location,
number, length, and A+T-richness.
Repeated sequences are generally considered to be
uncommon in chloroplast genomes with the notable
exception of the large IR present in most land plants [7].
Dispersed repeats are found more commonly in genomes
that have experienced changes in genome organization
[16,61,62], especially in highly rearranged algal genomes
[63,64]. A correlation between the number of repeats and
the extent of gene order change has been suggested for
algal genomes [64]. However, comparisons of completely
sequenced chloroplast genomes of the angiosperm families Fabaceae [65], Solanaceae [47], and Asteraceae [46]
have revealed the presence of numerous small repeats
scattered throughout these genomes even though these
genomes have few if any rearrangements. In each of these
families assessed by others, most of the repeats are 20 – 40
bp in length and they are located mostly in intergenic
spacer regions and introns, although several are located in
the protein-coding genes psaA, psaB, and ycf2. Our examination of repeats here in eight angiosperm chloroplast
genomes, representing a wider phylogenetic diversity than

that of earlier studies, identified numerous repeats in each
genome of a nature and pattern similar to those reported
by others based on narrower comparisons (Figure 9).
Again here, some of the shared SDR repeats, such as those
located in tRNA genes and those shared between psaA and
psaB, result from conserved sequence similarity of related
genes. The vast majority of the plastome SDRs are
restricted to intergenic spacer regions and introns and are
small in size. Earlier work suggesting that larger repeats
(of a size detectable via Southern Hybridization) are rare
in unrearranged plastid genomes is supported. However,
the pattern that seems to be emerging from all of these
analyses is that small SDRs in angiosperm genomes are
quite common and they tend to be located in the same
regions. The role of these conserved repeats is not known
but given that many of them are shared broadly and are
located in the same regions suggests that some may be
functional.

Conclusion
As additional chloroplast genomes from less-derived
angiosperm taxa are characterized we obtain a clearer picture of the ancestral plastid genome organization for
angiosperms. In large part these additional genomes
(reported here and by others) confirm that the Nicotiana
plastome is reasonably inferred to represent the ancestral
angiosperm for gene content and organization, although
perhaps not for exact IR boundaries. With notable exceptions, these features, seen in Nicotiana, are remarkably
conserved in most angiosperm lineages. The Nuphar
advena and Ranuculus macranthus chloroplast genome
sequences add to this growing body of data for reconstructing the evolution of plastid genomes. The Nuphar
genome, in addition, provided the opportunity for comparison with the relatively closely related Nymphaea alba
plastome sequence. This comparison confirmed views on
the conservative nature of the genome, with even some
IGS regions showing very high levels of nucleotide similarity. The Nuphar-Nymphaea comparison also supported
the view that SSR frequencies represent a balance between
two mutation types: SSM and substitutions. Detailed
comparisons among these and other genomes reveal
many differences and unexplained conservation of features that both remain to be understood. However, we are
able to suggest that the widely conserved sequences designated ycf15 and ycf68 are not protein-coding genes.
As has been noted many times elsewhere, chloroplast
genomes are biased towards A and T nucleotides, i.e., are
"A+T-rich", except for the RNA genes. Howe et al. [66] suggest that the A+T-richness of plastid genomes is the result
of endosymbiosis (or at least enhanced due to endosymbiosis). They argue that there might be a selective advantage for a particular protein-coding gene to be either A+Trich or G+C-rich and that each class of genes can be main-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/174

tained through compartmentalization in the different
genomes [66]. However, many other genomes, prokaryotic or eukaryotic, are as A+T-rich as (or even more biased
than) plastid genomes [31,53]. We suggest that the plastome A+T bias is relatively modest and results from a
slight mutation and/or error checking bias of the plastid
DNA polymerases or perhaps some selection for A and T
in otherwise neutral positions to increase ease of denaturation during replication or transcription. In any event, a
bias can be seen in overall composition, in the composition of the 3rd position of codons, and in which SSR
motifs are most abundant, among other aspects of the
genomic sequence. However on closer inspection A+T
richness does not correlate with variation in codon usage
or details of SSR abundance. We speculate that the interesting patterns are those that fail to track patterns of A+Trichness; for example, repeat sequences in non-coding
regions enriched for G and C are the ones more likely to
be functional and understanding the components of
codon bias that is not related to A+T-richness is more
likely to be significant.

Methods
DNA Sources
Leaf material of Nuphar advena (Aiton) W. T. Aiton was
obtained from a cultivated plant (vegetatively propagated
from wild material from Lake Moshanon, Center County,
PA) in the Biology Greenhouse at Pennsylvania State University. A voucher made from this same plant (collection
Claude W. dePamphilis 2001.301) was deposited at PAC.

Ranunculus macranthus Scheele leaf material was collected
from a wild population in Austin, TX. Leaves from multiple individual plants were combined to provide enough
material for the cpDNA isolations. A voucher was made
from a plant from this population and deposited in TEX.
Isolation Methods
Nuphar advena chloroplast DNA was prepared by the
sucrose gradient method [67]. However, the sucrose-gradient method did not yield pure enough cpDNA from
Ranunculus macranthus. Therefore, for Ranunculus macranthus the NaCl method [68] was used and yielded concentrated, sufficiently pure cpDNA and was used as the
sequencing template. Our isolation methods are
described in detail elsewhere [69].
Shotgun Sequencing and Finishing
Details of our methodology for producing finished
genomic sequences from the sequencing template
(cpDNA in this case) are provided in Jansen et al [69]. We
will provide an overview of our approach here.

Draft genomic sequence was prepared from the cpDNA
preparations at the DOE Joint Genome Institute. To do so,

Figure 9 of SDRs of different length classes found in eight different angiosperm plastid genomes
The number
The number of SDRs of different length classes found in eight different angiosperm plastid genomes. The majority of repeats
are 40 nt or less in length, but some genomes so have repeats that are longer. Triticum, the only genome to have repeats over
100 nt in length, is also the only genome to exhibit inversions changing aspects of gene order from the angiosperm consensus
order exhibited by Nicotiana (and the other genomes included.)

the DNA was sheared by passage through a narrow aperture and then fragments averaging 3 kb were selected from
an agarose gel and cloned into plasmids, which were then
used to transform E. coli. Clones were randomly selected
from these libraries and placed into 384-well plates and
templates amplified for sequencing using rolling circle
amplification. When sequenced, forward and reverse plasmid sequencing primers produced 500–750 bp of
sequence data (reads) from each end of the inserts. The
individual reads were then processed and assembled into
contigs using Phred and Phrap [70,71]. Four or five plates
(generating 768 reads each) provide 8–10× coverage if the
library is 60–80% cpDNA.

In the case of Nuphar, one library was constructed. The
sequencing reads from five plates assembled into a draft
genome composed of a single contig. In the case of Ranunculus, three libraries were constructed and fourteen plates
of sequence data were generated. These data assembled
into a draft genome composed of a single contig. The draft
sequences were then assessed visually using Consed [72]
to determine the level of quality of each nucleotide. Each
nucleotide in each read was assigned a quality score using
Phred [70]. Our minimum criterion was two reads with a
quality score of ≥ 20 for each position. At the vast majority
of positions this criterion was greatly exceeded, but occasionally areas of low coverage occurred and there were
some instances where the minimum criterion was not

met. In those cases, we designed primers to flank the
regions of these "quality gaps", PCR amplified a product
that contained the questionable nucleotide or nucleotides, and sequenced the PCR product until the criterion
was met. Five regions of low quality were confirmed in
this manner in Nuphar and two in Ranunculus.
We also confirmed the extent of the IR with a PCR and
sequencing strategy. In the shotgun sequencing approach,
the two copies of the IR are not sequenced separately. Like
the remainder of the genome, the sequence for the IR
region is built up via the overlap and assembly of the 500–
700 bp sequencing reads. Sequences derived from templates representing both copies of the IR assemble
together. The IR can be recognized generally in Consed as
the depth of sequencing reads doubles in that region and
the boundaries can be inferred where the two reads from
a single clone assemble far from each other. However to
precisely define the boundaries we designed primers to
amplify across each of the four IR-single copy junctions,
sequenced the PCR products and compared those
sequences to one another and to the draft genome. In this
manner we were able to confirm the precise location of
the IR-LSC and IR-SSC boundaries.
Annotation and related studies
We used DOGMA [73] as our primary tool for annotating
these two genomes. DOGMA uses BLASTX [74] to compare the genomic sequence against a custom database of
genes constructed using corrected annotations of 17 completely sequenced chloroplast genomes. This produces a

draft annotation that is then inspected using DOGMA's
tools for accurate assessment of the start and codon of
each gene and any contained exon-intron boundaries.
Because of the limitations of BLAST searches, small exons
(6–9 nucleotides) that occur in three chloroplast genes
cannot be found by DOGMA or by using other versions of
Blast searches, so these were located manually. Putative
gene and exon boundaries are determined by detailed
comparison with other annotated genomes and individual gene sequences; no expression or protein studies were
conducted to confirm the assignments.
Investigations of ycf15 and ycf68
To investigate the distribution and nature of ycf15, we
extracted the ycf15 sequence from the Nicotiana tabaccum
genome (NC_001879) and conducted pairwise BLAST
searches between this and each of the 63 then-available
complete chloroplast genome sequences. If any portion of
the ycf15 sequence was not detected in comparisons
against whole genome sequences, the ycf2:trnL spacer
region was extracted and just that portion of the genome
was compared to the Nicotiana ycf15 sequence. ClustalW
[75] alignments were also conducted to assess levels of
conservation in a subset of genomes.

Pairwise BLAST (bl2seq [76]) was also used to assess ycf68
distributional patterns, here using the ycf68 sequence
from Zea and Nymphaea against all 63 then-published
plastid genomes. Also, since ycf68 is found in the trnIGAU intron, it seemed possible that the conserved
sequence could be related to folding during excision. The

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:174

trnI-GAU intron was extracted using NCBI or DOGMA
from all the species listed in Table 3 that contain an intron
in trnI-GAU and folded using the web-based programs
mfold [77] and DINAmelt [78] using default settings. We
then examined the folding patterns to look for regions
with conserved folding domains. We saw no obvious correlation between the position of the region of sequence
similarity and the folding structure hypothesized by either
program.
Another method for investigating the functionality of an
ORF was designed by Echols et al. [31]. They looked at
codon usage in pseudogenes, genes, and intergenic
regions to determine how pseudogenes were evolving and
if amino acid frequency could be an indicator of the functionality of a conserved region of DNA [31]. They separately calculated the frequency of amino acids in coding,
noncoding, and known pseudogene sequences and then
graphed the results to display trends of usage in the three
sequence types. They found that the amino acid frequency
in pseudogenes was an exact intermediate between amino
acid frequency in known genes and intergenic DNA, and
argued that this method is a valid way to determine
whether or not a gene is functional [31]. We used this
method to investigate whether or not ycf15 and ycf68 had
amino acid frequencies similar to coding, noncoding, or
an intermediate to differentiate among the hypotheses
that the ycfs are genes, pseudogenes, or simply non-coding DNA. Algorithms from web-based suite of tools
BABEL [79] were used to calculate the frequency of amino
acids. For Ranunculus and Nuphar, we input all coding
DNA sequences and recorded the amino acid frequency.
We determined codon usage in the noncoding sequence
by averaging the codon usage for each reading frame (the
difference in frequency among the six reading frames is
minimal) to get a frequency estimate. BABEL tools [79]
were also used to calculate amino acid frequency in the
intron sequence of trnI-GAU and the ycf2:trnL-CAA intergenic region. These results were then graphed. In the
Echols et al. [31] analysis the amino acid frequency for
each amino acid was graphed in order of decreasing levels
of variation. We tried multiple methods for arranging the
amino acids including that of Echols et al., alphabetical,
high and low frequency, standard deviation of the frequency across all types of DNA, etc. We found that manipulation of the order of amino acids on the X-axis changed
the results so much that we could display evidence for any
of the hypotheses under consideration. Therefore, we do
not believe that this type of analysis is valid, at least not
with our data. Perhaps with the larger sample sizes, from
nuclear genomes, available to Echols et al. the approach is
more consistent.
We further investigated the characteristics of ycf15 and
ycf68 by comparing sequence similarity of the trnI-GAU

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/174

intron and the intergenic spacer between ycf2 and trnLCAA to other introns and intergenic spacers throughout
the chloroplast genome to see if the intergenic/intron
regions containing ycf15 and ycf68 are more conserved
than that of other noncoding DNA in the chloroplast
genome. We used the web-based program Mulan [32] to
compare noncoding DNA in our sequences to a reference
sequence – Nicotiana tabacum for ycf15 and Zea mays for
ycf68. Mulan performs pairwise sequence comparisons of
the input sequence to the chosen reference sequence. We
used the default setting of 100 for the ECR (evolutionary
conserved region) length, the minimum amount of base
pairs that have to align for similarity to register on the histogram, and 50 percent for the ECR similarity. The algorithm then returns graphical information about the
likeness of the input sequences to the reference sequence;
output is in the form of a histogram showing the similarity of the sequences from 50 to 100 percent. To see if
introns were commonly conserved at a level equivalent to
that represented by the ycf68 motif, we compared the
intron in trnI-GAU with a sample of other introns within
the inverted repeat (trnA-UGC and ndhB), and in the large
single copy region (trnG-UCC, trnL-UAA, and trnV-UAC).
To investigate conservation of the nucleotide sequence in
the ycf2:trnL intergenic spacer, relative to the ycf15 question, we compared it to intergenic DNA that is outside of
known operons in the inverted repeat (3'rps12:trnV-GAC
and trnN-GUU:ycf1) and the large single copy region
(rpoB:trnC-GCA, trnT-GGU:psbD, and psaA:ycf3).
Codon Usage
Alternative start codon usage was determined based on
published annotations with additional comparisons. All
genes annotated with an alternative start were aligned to
determine whether or not the start was homologous with
non-alternative start codons in other taxa. If the annotated
alternative start was the result of a longer or shorter annotation, the region homologous to the start codon of other
taxa was examined to determine whether or not the normal start codon was present.

Codon usage patterns for each genome were determined
using FREQSQ from BABEL [79] and CodonW [41]. The
predicted relationship of ENc and GC3 was determined
using Wright's equation as given by Novembre [43]. The
equation as printed in the Wright 1990 paper [42] contains a typographical error.
Nuphar-Nymphaea comparison
The complete chloroplast genome of Nuphar was subdivided into individual coding and non-coding regions,
and each region was compared against the entire Nymphaea genome using the BLAST2 algorithm [76] available
on the National Center for Biotechnology Information
website. The output files from BLAST2 were used to deter-

mine the percent similarity of each region. BLAST2
presents errors when one sequence under comparison
contains mononucleotide repeats with runs greater than
six nucleotides; n is indicated in place of each repeating
nucleotide at those positions and considered "nonmatching" in similarity calculations. These errors were
checked against the genome sequences and corrected
before calculations were made. Nucleotide sequence fragments that BLAST2 did not align (and did not show) were
scored as zeros and negatively affected the % identity
value. For example if only 425 of the known 450 nucleotides in a gene were aligned by BLAST2, and it was otherwise a perfect match, then the % identity would be 425/
450 or 94.4%. BLAST2 does not display insertions or deletion events (indels) of greater than 10 nucleotides; such a
disparity between the sequences would lead to the two
adjoining regions of similarity being displayed as separate
regions of identity.
We looked at indels as well as nucleotide similarity. We
characterized indels as insertions or deletions relative to
Nuphar. If Nuphar contained sequence for which there was
no equivalent in Nymphaea is was considered an insertion,
whereas if nucleotides in the Nymphaea sequence lacked a
Nuphar equivalent it was a deletion. We used BLAST2 [76]
to quantify indels in coding regions only. MULAN [32]
was used to produce a total genome alignment for Nuphar
and Nymphaea. Indels in the entire genome were quantified using this output. Simple subtraction of the coding
region indels from the total number of indels provided
the number found in intergenic regions. We quantified
indels of 5–9 bp, 10–19 bp and 20 or greater bp.
SSR Analysis
To locate and characterize SSRs in these genomes, we used
the Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) Extractor Utility [80].
We screened for all perfect mono-, di- and tri-nucleotide
repeats of length at least 8,8, or 9 nucleotides, respectively.
We also determined the number and nature of mono-, diand tri- nucleotide repeats of length at least 10, 10 or 12
nucleotides. In addition to analyzing SSR content of
Nuphar and Ranunculus, we examined the chloroplast
genomes of the other completely sequenced land plant
genomes available at the time of the analysis. These chloroplast genome sequences were obtained from GenBank
(accession numbers given in Table 7). To assess possible
relationships between the number of longer SSRs and the
number of shorter SSRs as well as the number of SSRs and
genome size and A+T-richness and frequencies of particular SSR motifs, we conducted Spearman rank correlation
tests using an online calculator [55]. Predicted numbers of
SSRs of particular composition were calculated based on
the underlying compositional nucleotide frequencies. For
example, if A+T frequency in the genome overall is 0.638
then the frequency of a mononucleotide repeat of length

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/174

8 nt would be (0.638)8 and the number of length 8nt A+T
SSRs expected would be the frequency* (genome length/
SSR length). To determine whether the composition of
SSRs deviated from expectation based on overall nucleotide, dinucleotide and trinucleotide frequencies of the
genomes (determined using FREQSQ [79]), we used a
Chi-square test. Predicted number of each class of repeat
was calculated as the ((expected frequency of a particular
type of repeat, calculated as just stated)/(total of expected
frequencies of all categories)) * observed total number of
repeats. For example, in Huperzia, which has an A+T frequency of 0.638 and a G+C frequency of 0.362, the
expected frequency of A+T mononucleotide repeats of
length 8 is (0.638)8 and of G+C 8 nt mononucleotide SSRs
is (0.362)8. The expected number of A+T mononucleotide
runs, given that 147 mononucleotide repeats of 8nt and
longer are observed in that genome, is (0.638)8/
((0.638)8*(0.362)8)*147 = 145.44. We did simplify the
calculations by basing our predictions on repeats of minimum length, which was also the mean and median
length (i.e., we considered all the repeats that we observed
to be of minimum length for these calculations).
SDR analysis
Shared and unique direct and inverted repeats were identified for eight angiosperm chloroplast genomes using the
Comparative Repeat Analysis program [81]. This program
uses REPuter [82] but it has two additional features: it filters out repeats that are contained entirely within other
repeats, and it identifies shared repeats among the input
genomes by Blasting the repeats from each genome
against all other genomes. For repeat identification, the
following settings were used: (i) minimum repeat size of
30 bp; (ii) 90% or greater sequence identity, based on
Hamming distance equal to 3; and (iii) an e-value of 2 for
Blast comparisons against the other genomes.
