Abstract
Background: The prophenoloxidase-activating (PO activating) system plays an important role in the crustacean
innate immunity, particularly in wound healing and pathogen defense. A key member of this system is
prophenoloxidase-activating enzyme (PPAE), which is the direct activator of prophenoloxidase (proPO). Despite
their importance in crustacean PO activating system, the studies on them remain limited.
Results: Here we report on a PPAE of white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei (lvPPAE1), which showed 94% similarity
to PPAE1 of Penaeus monodon. We found that lvPPAE1 in fluid hemocytes was down regulated after challenge by
Vibrio harveyi but was enhanced when shrimps were exposed to a bacteria-rich environment for long-term. In vivo
gene silence of lvPPAE1 by RNAi can significantly reduce the phenoloxidase activity (PO) and increase the
susceptibility of shrimps to V. harveyi. Although lvPPAE1 was down-regulated in fluid hemocytes by Vibrio
challenge, its expression increased significantly in gill after bacteria injection, which is the primary bacteriaclearance tissue.
Conclusion: Suppressed expression in fluid hemocytes and enhanced expression in gill indicates selectively
enhanced expression at the bacterial clearance site. This is a novel feature for PPAE expression. The results will
contribute to our understanding of the PO activating system in crustaceans.

Background
Innate immunity is of great importance to insects and
crustaceans because they lack antibodies [1]. Innate
immunity involves phagocytosis, encapsulation, hemocyte coagulation and activation of the prophenoloxidase
(proPO) or melanization cascade [2,3]. Activation of
proPO generates phenoloxidase (PO), which catalyzes
the oxygenation of monophenols to o-diphenols and the
oxidation of o-diphenols to the corresponding o-quinones [4]. These are reactive intermediates for melanin
synthesis and other physiological processes such as cuticle sclerotization, wound healing and pathogen sequestration [5].

In most cases, the proPO cascade is triggered by a
small amount of microbe-derived molecules such as
lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), b-1, 3-glucans, or peptidoglycan. Pattern-recognition proteins bind these molecules and initiate the proPO system through a quick
proteolytic cascade, and many proteins involved in the
proteolytic cascade are serine proteinases [6]. The final
serine proteinase that converts the inactive proPO into
its active form is called prophenoloxidase-activating
enzyme (PPAE) [5].
The proPO genes of insects and crustaceans have been
intensively studied [7-14], and models for the serine
proteinase cascades regulating proPO activation have
been studied in detail in some insects such as Manduca
sexta and Tenebrio molitor [15-23]. Studies on proPOactivating cascades are limited in crustaceans. Hitherto,
few PPAEs in crustaceans have been reported, except
for in crayfish, Pacifastacus leniusculus and shrimp,

Penaeus monodon [24-26]. In this study, the PPAE1 of
white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei was identified and
its expression feature was reported. The new findings of
the study will contribute to our understanding of PO
activating system of crustaceans.

Results
Isolation and lvPPAE1 sequence

The full-length lvPPAE1 cDNA was 1557 bp, with an
ORF of 1389, a 5’-UTR of 57 bp, and a 3’-UTP of 111
bp. The theoretical pI and Mw were 6.96 and 50.4 kDa.
The proteolytic activation site was found between
Arg228 and Ile229. The pI and Mw of activated
lvPPAE1 were 4.5 and 25.4 kDa. The lvPPAE1 protein
showed 94% identity to pmPPAE1 and 61% to plPPAE.
Three amino acid residues (H270, D319, and S412) corresponded to the catalytic triad of the SP domain and
another three amino acid residues (D406, S433, and
G435) to the substrate binding sites.
Multiple alignments between the sequences of
lvPPAE1, plPPAE, and pmPPAE1 showed that this gene
is relatively well conserved in crustaceans (Figure 1).
lvPPAE1 exhibited a typical clip-domain structure, composed of six cysteines at the N-terminus. Similar to
other crustacean PPAEs, a glycine-rich domain was
found between residues 40 and 130, with 17.6% glycines

Page 2 of 11

(16/91, pI = 12.2), and a proline-rich domain was found
between residues 194 and 226, with 39.4% prolines (13/
33, pI = 12.5).
lvPPAE phylogenetic analysis

A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighborjoining method (Figure 2) by comparing the deduced
amino acid sequence of the conserved SP domain to the
82 clip-domain serine proteinases showing the most
similarity or any reported PPAEs. The 83 proteinases
were separated into two main branches: one mainly
composed of insect prophenoloxidase-activating proteins
and the other composed of insect pro-clotting enzymes.
The PPAEs of crustaceans were classified into the second main branch and they shared the same and a
unique sub-branch. Except for seven pro-clotting
enzymes and five trypsins, the biological roles of the
clip-domain serine proteinases from the second main
branch are still unclear.
Tissue-specific gene expression in healthy shrimp and
bacteria-challenged shrimp

lvPPAE1 gene expression was analyzed by qRT-PCR.
lvPPAE1 in SPF shrimps was mainly expressed in hemocytes and gill, whilst low level was detected in the other
tissues. The relative expression in FHs was about 3.5-

relative expression level of lvPPAE1 in gill was as same
as that in FHs, which indicated an increase in the gill
(Figure 3). Gill samples from the challenged shrimps
were checked using microscope with phase contrast
mode. Intensive hemocyte aggregation was found in gill
canals (Figure 5A, B).

Temporal expression of lvPPAE1 corresponding to
bacterial challenge

Hemocytes and gill were sampled at each time point
after the challenge. qRT-PCR showed that the lvPPAE1
mRNA expression level began to decline in FHs in a
short time post challenge. This suppression became
more obvious after 4 hpc (hour post challenge); the

expression level decreased by 60% compared to the control (0 h). After 16 hpc, the expression recovered slightly
but then declined again and remained suppressed after
48 hpc. Multiple comparison between challenged and
saline injected groups at each time point showed the
suppression of lvPPAE1 were significant at 2, 4, 8 and
24 hpc. Temporal expression in saline injected shrimp
was not changed significantly. The two results, normalized to 18 s and b-actin separately, were well matched
(Figure 4A, B). However, the relative change in expression in gills was different. At 4 hpc, lvPPAE1 expression
in gill was significantly enhanced to about 2.5-fold than
that of the control (0 h). After a relative decline at 8
hpc, the expression level increased to 3-fold compared
to the control and the high expression was sustained for
48 hpc (Figure 5C).
Gene expression analysis in shrimp reared in different
bacterial environments

Vibrio in the biofloc and filtered seawater was calculated
following colony forming unit method after a 24-h culture. The Vibrio number in biofloc seawater was 3.5 ×
104 CFU/ml, whereas 45 CFU/ml were found in filtered
seawater (Figure 6A). The relative lvPPAE1 mRNA
expression level in FHs of shrimp reared in different
bacterial environments was analyzed by qRT-PCR. Five
samples were taken as replicates for expression analysis.
The relative lvPPAE1 mRNA expression level in shrimps
exposed to a higher bacteria environment was 2.5-fold

than that of those exposed to a lower level of bacteria
(Figure 6B).
RNA interference of lvPPAE1

qRT-PCR was used to detect the dsRNA interference
effect 12 and 24 h after the first dsRNA injection and 24 h
after the second injection. Total RNA extracted from the
hemocytes of gene-silenced shrimp was analyzed. RNAi
strongly inhibited lvPPAE1 expression. The amount of
mRNA decreased to less than 5% of the control 24 h after
the second lvPPAE1 dsRNA injection (0 h, Figure 7A).
Susceptibility of shrimp to Vibrio harveyi after gene
silencing

Susceptibility of shrimps to V. harveyi was tested after
gene silence. About 1 h after the challenge, shrimps in
the gene-silenced group began to show symptoms of
slowed mobility and imbalance, as well as mortality after
2 h. Saline-injected shrimp showed symptoms after at
least 4 h, and mortality began after 8 h. Mortality in the
saline pre-injected group reached about 50% after 48 h,
and all gene-silenced shrimp died within 24 h. No mortality was found in the saline-only injected group and
occasional mortality was found in the lvPPAE1 dsRNAonly injected group (Figure 7B).
PO activity assay

PO activity was analyzed in shrimp injected with genespecific dsRNA, GFP dsRNA, or saline solution. PO-

by approximately 50% compared to the saline-injected

to pmPPAE1 (94%), which is the terminal enzyme in the
prophenoloxidase-activating cascade [25,26]. Thus, we
named this gene lvPPAE1. Multiple alignment results
indicated that this gene is rather well conserved in crustaceans. Interestingly, phylogenetic analyses revealed
that all PPAEs in crustaceans branched off into the cluster of insect pro-clotting proteinases rather than insect
PPAEs. Besides with molecular structure deviation,
PPAEs in crustaceans can proteolyses proPO dependently [27], unlike most of insect PPAEs that need
cofactors to active proPOs [6]. Another major difference
between PPAEs in crustaceans and insects is the different regulation type to pathogen invasion. Three prophenoloxidase activating proteinase of the horn worm
Manduca sexta were reported to be stimulated or upregulated by injection of Micrococcus lysodeikticus or
Escherichia coli [17,28,29]. Five putative PPAEs of the
fly Drosophila were induced to higher levels after E. coli
and Micrococcus luteus infection [30]. Two potential

regulated by bacteria E. coli or M. luteus and parasite
Plasmodium berghei [31]. A prophenoloxidase activation
proteinase of the silk worm Samia cynthia ricini was
inducible by cell wall components of gram-positive bacteria [32]. Contrary to those insect PPAEs, The crayfish
PPAE transcript level was reported to be unaffected
upon Aeromonas hydrophila challenge [33]. The
pmPPAE1 transcript level in P. monodon was down
regulated 3-24 h after Vibrio injection [25]. In the present study, the lvPPAE1 transcript abundance was
reduced within 48 h after Vibrio challenge. All reported
crustacean PPAEs as well as our study showed their
transcript levels were either not affected or down-regulated within 48 h, contrary to PPAEs in insects that
were up-regulated or stimulated within 24 h after challenge. Dissimilarity in proteinase structures and functional features imply certain degree of difference exists
between crustaceans and insects for the prophenoloxidase-activating mechanism, particularly in the down
stream.

It has been reported that the PPAE1 mRNA of crustaceans were found specially in hemocyte and free from
other tissues [25]. Our tissue distribution analysis by
qRT-PCR also revealed that lvPPAE1 transcript level
was very low in muscle, antenna gland, nerve cord and
digesting system, and this minimum expression also
could be caused by a few amount of hemocytes penetrated into the tissues [5]. The most convincing proof
was that the lvPPAE1 transcript level in those tissues
didn’t change after bacteria challenge, suggesting that
these tissues were in fact free of lvPPAE1 transcripts.
This conclusion is in accordance with the previous
report [25]. However, it is notable that during bacteria
clearance process in shrimps, bacteria or foreign materials would be encapsulated by hemocytes to form hemocyte-foreign material aggregation and this kind of
aggregation happens mainly in gill, which is the main
bacteria or alien materials clearance site [34]. This phenomenon was also confirmed by our microscope observation (Figure 5A, B). In another word, gill is closely

related with hemocytic immunity in host defense of
shrimps. By sensitive qRT-PCR method, we successfully
found out the inevitable repercussion of this close relation: The lvPPAE1 mRNA transcripts represented a considerable level and even higher after Vibrio challenge.
Our RNAi experiment showed silence of lvPPAE1 significantly reduced the PO activity and increased the susceptibility to V. harveyi. qRT-PCR revealed shrimps
exposed in a bacteria rich environment for a long-term
presented a higher lvPPAE1 transcript level. Those
results suggested the importance of lvPPAE1 in the host
defense of L. vannamei. It is thus odd to find the
expression of lvPPAE1 was depressed when shrimps
tried to fight against the injected bacteria. Same phenomenon was found in another shrimp species P. monodon, yet the author didn’t give an explanation. Our
findings in gill gave a clue to answer the doubtful question. Although the transcript expression of lvPPAE1 in
gill was in fact due to the fixed hemocytes (GH), the
transcript level of GHs showed different regulation type
than in FHs. Contrary to the continuous dropping trend
in FHs, the transcript level of lvPPAE1 in gill was stimulated quickly and arrived to a peak at 4 h when the
depression in FHs was at the upmost degree. Higher
lvPPAE1 mRNA transcript level was maintained in gill
within 48 h when the lvPPAE1 was continuously
depressed in FHs. By now, a new conclusion was drawn
that the lvPPAE1 was not simply down-regulated by
Vibrio challenge but also up-regulated in bacteria clearance site. By the current data, it can not be asserted
that the overall lvPPAE1 transcript level was depressed
or enhanced shortly after the Vibrio challenge; we thus
call the expression feature as the “selective enhanced
expression”. Because the selective enhanced expression
in gill happens simultaneously with the suppression in
fluid hemocytes, the endogenous regulation mechanism
for the short time enhanced expression in bacteria clearance site is probably different from the enhanced
expression in FHs under a long-term, bacteria-rich
environment stress. Our current study on lvPPAE1 indicated that the endogenous regulation mechanism for
shrimp immunity is far from clarified.

Conclusion
A prophenoloxidase activating enzyme (lvPPAE1) of the
white shrimp L. vannamei was cloned and sequenced.
In vivo gene silence of lvPPAE1 significantly deduced
the PO activity and increased the susceptibility of
shrimps to gram negative bacteria V. harveyi. The overall tissue distribution analysis showed the lvPPAE1 was
mainly expressed in fluid hemocytes (FH) and gill due
to the aggregated hemocytes in canal (GH). The
lvPPAE1 expression was significantly enhanced in gill
within 2 h after V. harveyi challenge. In the case of FH,

Page 7 of 11

lvPPAE1 expression was suppressed within 48 h after a
single challenge, whereas higher expression was found
when shrimp was exposed to a high bacterial environment over the long term. The different gene expression
responses to bacterial challenge in FH and gill suggest
enhanced lvPPAE1 expression at the bacteria-clearance
site.
In conclusion, the lvPPAE1 is involved in melanization
cascade and plays an important role in shrimp host
defense against bacteria. The expression in FH was suppressed in a short term after V. harveyi challenge but
was up regulated under bacterial press for a long term.
The lvPPAE1 represents a feature of selective enhanced
expression in bacteria clearance site after challenge. This
is a novel characteristic for crustacean PPAEs
expression.

Methods
Animals, sample preparation and RNA preparation

Specific pathogen-free (SPF) L. vannamei (10 g ± 1.2 g
mean ± SD) were obtained from a biofloc water culture
system at the NFRDI (Seoul, Korea) and were maintained in filtered running seawater for two weeks, if
needed. All tissue preparations were performed as bellow: Tissues such as muscle, stomach, antenna gland,
nerve cord, intestine, hepatopancreas, or gill were
obtained by dissection. Hemolymph was collected from
the ventral hemolymph sinus of L. vannamei with a 3
ml RNase-free syringe containing on ice pre-cooled
anticoagulant (113 mM glucose, 27.2 mM sodium
citrate, 2.8 mM citric acid, and 71.9 mM NaCl). The
hemocyte cell pellet was collected by centrifugation at
700 × g and 4°C for 10 min followed by two rinses with
anticoagulant. All tissues were placed immediately in
200 μl RNA later reagents after preparation (Ambion,
Austin, TX, USA). Total RNA was extracted with the
RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and
further purified with DNase I (Qiagen), according to the
manufacturer’s protocol.
cDNA synthesis and rapid amplification of cDNA ends

The first-strand cDNA for 5’ rapid amplification of
cDNA ends (RACE) and 3’ RACE was synthesized separately with the SMARTer™ RACE cDNA Amplification
Kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA), according to
the user’s manual. The first-strand cDNA was diluted
20 times to serve as the RACE template. A degenerate
of the gene-specific primer lvPPAERACE3’ was designed
based on other crustacean PPAE sequences [25,26]. PCR
amplification was performed with the specific primer
and two universal primer provided by the kit. The
touchdown PCR conditions were as follows: five cycles
of 94°C for 30 s and 72°C for 3 min; five cycles of 94°C
for 30 s, 70°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 3 min; 25 cycles of

Jang et al. BMC Immunology 2011, 12:70
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2172/12/70

94°C for 30 s, 68°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 3 min. PCR
products were then subcloned into the TOPO vector
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and sequenced. The
fragment sequence was confirmed by the BLAST program on NCBI by comparison with other shrimp serine
proteases. A new primer, lvPPAERACE5’, was designed
based on the partial sequence of lvPPAE1. 5’ RACE was
performed with the new primer and universal primers
mentioned above with the same PCR conditions as 3’
RACE. Then the 5’ RACE product was subcloned into
the TOPO vector and sequenced. After the 5’ RACE
sequence was confirmed by BLAST, 3’ RACE fragment
and 5’ RACE fragment sequences were joined using the
Mega 4 program [35].
Sequence analysis

The open reading frame (ORF) of the gene was analyzed
by the ORF finder program on NCBI. The nucleotide
sequence and deduced amino acid sequences were analyzed by the BLAST program on NCBI. Multiple alignments were performed with the Clustal W2 program
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/clustalw2/, and the result
was viewed with Genedoc 2.7.0 [36]. A neighbor-joining
phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the SP
domain of the deduced amino acid sequences of
lvPPAE1 and the 82 clip-domain serine proteinases
showing highest similarity or the prophenoloxidase-activating proteins of insects using the Mega 4 program
[35]. The lvPPAE1 signal peptide was predicted with the
SignalP 3.0 server http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/. The theoretical isoelectric point (pI) and molecular weight (Mw) of the proteins were estimated online
http://isoelectric.ovh.org/.
Quantitative real-time PCR for mRNA detection

A Taqman probe-based quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) technique was taken to test the
lvPPAE1 transcript level. Tissue distribution or mRNA
expression under different circumstance stresses can
thus be evaluated by this method. A pair of gene-specific primers qRTPPAEf, qRTPPAEr and a Taqman
qRTPPAEp probe were designed from the full-length
lvPPAE1 cDNA sequence using PrimerExpress software
(Applied Biosystems Pty Ltd., Melbourne, Australia).
One-step qRT-PCR was accomplished with the One
Step PrimeScript™ RT-PCR perfect real time Kit
(Takara Bio). The reaction mixture consisted of 10 μl
2× One-Step RT-PCR Buffer III, 2 units of Takara Ex
Hot Start Taq enzyme, 0.4 μl reverse transcript enzyme
Mix II, and 0.4 μM each of forward primer, reverse primer, and Taqman probe in a final reaction volume of 20
μl. The PCR conditions were as follows: 42°C for 5 min,
95°C for 10 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 5 s and
60°C for 30 s. Fluorescent signal detection was started

Page 8 of 11

from the first cycle of the annealing stage. The 18 s
ribosomal RNA (18 s) and b-actin was taken as references with primers and probe shown in Table 1.
Vibrio challenge for temporal expression assay

V. harveyi KCCM 40866 obtained from the Korean Culture Center of Microorganism (KCCM) was used in a
preliminary challenge trial to determine its pathogenicity. Then it was further selectively enriched from the
hepatopancreas of freshly killed shrimp in the preliminary challenge on tryptic soy agar (Difco, Franklin Lakes,
NJ, USA) plate. Harvested bacteria were diluted with
physiological saline (154 mM) to an OD540 of 0.09 (106
CFU). The diluted bacteria (100 μl) were injected into
the third abdominal segment. SPF shrimps (about 10
gram) from biofloc culture system were raised in filtered
sea water for 2 weeks before challenge. One hundred
and twenty individuals were challenged and a control
group of 50 individuals were injected with the same
volume of saline. Gill and hemocyte were sampled at 0
h, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, 12 h and 48 h after bacteria or saline injection. Five shrimps for each group were sampled
as replicates at each time point separately. Temporal
expression was detected by qRT-PCR and the relative
expression data were analyzed by Dunnett’s t- test and
Tukey’s range test.
Vibrio count in biofloc and filtered sea water and
corresponding lvPPAE1 mRNA expression

Water samples (200 μl) from biofloc water or filtered
sea water were spread on 0.2% sodium-chloride thiosulfate citrate bile salt agar (Difco) and incubated at 28°C
for 24 h before the colonies were counted. Vibrio colony
numbers were counted three times everyday continuously for 4 days. Fluid hemocytes were extracted from
SPF shrimps (about 10 gram) raised in biofloc water culture system or filtered running seawater and the
lvPPAE1 mRNA level were measured and compared
with qRT-PCR. Five shrimps were sampled as replicates
from the two culture systems separately. The deference
of PO activity was analyzed by unpaired t-test for
unequal variance.
dsRNA production

First-strand cDNA was synthesized with the PrimeScript™ First-Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Takara Bio)
with the oligo dT Primer, according to the manufacturer’s protocol. A pair of forward and reverse primers
with a T7 promoter oligo anchor (dslvPPAEf,
dslvPPAEr) amplifying a fragment of 542 lvPPAE1
nuclei fragments was designed. The PCR amplification
was conducted with a reaction mixture of 2 μl 10× PCR
buffer, 1.6 μl dNTP mixture, and 0.1 μl ExTaq enzyme
with a final primer concentration of 0.4 μM. One μl

first-strand cDNA was added to make a final volume of
20 μl with PCR water. The PCR conditions were as follows: 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 59°C for 30 s, and 72°C
for 1 min 30 s. PCR fragments were purified by agarose
gel electrophoresis and subcloned into the TOPO vector
(Invitrogen). Sequences were confirmed by sequence
alignment and then used as the template for a secondary
PCR with T7 promoter primers only. The secondary PCR
product was then used as a template to produce dsRNA.
dsRNA was produced and purified using the RiboMAX™
T7 Express System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA),
according to the user’s manual. dsRNA concentration
was calculated by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm
with a spectrophotometer (Cary 100 scan spectrophotometer, Varian). An alien GFP protein sequence was
amplified with the PEGFP-1 (Clontech) reconstructed
vector, using the dsGFPf forward primer and the dsGFPr
reverse primer (encoding 303 nuclei), and the produced
dsRNA fragment was used as a control.
In vivo gene silencing

lvPPAE1 and GFP protein dsRNA were diluted in 0.9%
saline separately. Diluted dsRNA was injected into the
third abdominal segment using a 1 ml sterile hypodermic syringe with a 26 gauge needle. Approximately 1 μg
lvPPAE1 or GFP dsRNA was used per 1 g shrimp.
Another injection with the same amount of dsRNA was
performed 24 h later. The gene silencing effect was
tested by qRT-PCR.
Analysis of susceptibility to V. harveyi

Susceptibility of lvPPAE1 gene silenced or control
shrimp to V. harveyi was evaluated. SPF shrimps from
biofloc system were pre-raised in 26°C filtered sea water

for two weeks and used for experiment. Shrimps were
challenged simultaneously with the second dsRNA injection for gene silencing. Mortality of gene silenced or
control shrimp was monitored within 48 h. Two additional groups injected with only saline or only lvPPAE1
dsRNA were set as controls to determine mortality from
the procedure. Thirty individuals for each group were
used to calculate the mortality rate and the experiment
were repeated for three times.
Phenoloxidase activity assay

Hemolymph of shrimps from the gene silenced or control
group were extracted with anticoagulant buffer, centrifuged at 700 × g and 4°C for 15 min. The cell pellet was
rinsed twice with anticoagulant buffer, resuspended, and
centrifuged at 16000 × g and 4°C for 5 min. An aliquot
(500 μl) of ice-cold homogenizer buffer containing 10 mM
sodium cacodylate, 5 mM CaCl2, pH 7.0 (Sigma, Munich,
Germany) was added, and the cell pellet was homogenized
for 2 min at full speed to release the proteins. The cell
homogenate was then centrifuged at 10000 × g and 4°C
for 10 min, and the supernatant (LPS) was used for the
PO activity test. LPS (100 μl) and 50 μl laminarin (0.1 mg/
ml, Sigma) was mixed in a 96-well ELISA plate and incubated at 27°C for 10 min. L-3, 4-dihydroxyphenylalanine
(50 μl, 3 mg/ml) was added, and PO activity was measured
with an ELISA reader, using dynamic read style, for 20
min at room temperature. Absorbance at 490 nm was
measured from 10 to 20 min. Protein concentration was
measured with a BCA™ Protein Assay Kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). PO activity was calculated as OD490/mg
LPS protein/min. Data was analyzed by analysis of variance followed with Duncan’s multiple range test. Five
individuals were sampled as replicates.
