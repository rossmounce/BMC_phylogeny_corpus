Abstract
Background: Gene ortholog identification is now a major objective for mining the increasing
amount of sequence data generated by complete or partial genome sequencing projects.
Comparative and functional genomics urgently need a method for ortholog detection to reduce
gene function inference and to aid in the identification of conserved or divergent genetic pathways
between several species. As gene functions change during evolution, reconstructing the
evolutionary history of genes should be a more accurate way to differentiate orthologs from
paralogs. Phylogenomics takes into account phylogenetic information from high-throughput
genome annotation and is the most straightforward way to infer orthologs. However, procedures
for automatic detection of orthologs are still scarce and suffer from several limitations.
Results: We developed a procedure for ortholog prediction between Oryza sativa and Arabidopsis
thaliana. Firstly, we established an efficient method to cluster A. thaliana and O. sativa full proteomes
into gene families. Then, we developed an optimized phylogenomics pipeline for ortholog inference.
We validated the full procedure using test sets of orthologs and paralogs to demonstrate that our
method outperforms pairwise methods for ortholog predictions.
Conclusion: Our procedure achieved a high level of accuracy in predicting ortholog and paralog
relationships. Phylogenomic predictions for all validated gene families in both species were easily
achieved and we can conclude that our methodology outperforms similarly based methods.

Background
The availability of complete plant genomes for comparative analysis provides new perspectives in plant development and evolution which will allow an understanding of
major trends in plant evolution and species-specific adaptations. The evolutionary history of gene families can be
reconstructed and their importance in some morphological innovations evaluated. Sequencing plant genomes
along the evolutionary path will be very helpful in elucidating how modifications in expression of key develop-

mental genes and/or coding sequences during evolution
are somehow responsible for major trait changes or innovations. Up to now, the genomes of three dicotyledons (A.
thaliana [1], P. trichocharpa [2] and Vitis vinifera [3]), one
monocotyledon (O. sativa) [4] and a moss (Physcometrilla
patens [5]) have been fully sequenced. The comparison of
their gene repertories will help to formulate hypotheses
either on conservation or divergence for biological process among several species [6]. Moreover, comparative
analysis will be of crucial importance for all species of

agronomical interest in which functional analysis of genes
can be tedious. Annotation transfer from model species
will be the only way to assign a function to the majority of
genes in these species.
Two genes are considered to be orthologs if they are separated by a speciation event. Although this definition has
nothing to do with biological function, it is commonly
assumed that orthologs have equivalent functions in different species. Paralogs are homologs separated by duplication and may have biologically different functions. Coorthologs/Ultraparalogs are two or more genes in one species that are together orthologous to one or more genes in
another species (see [7] for a general discussion of these
definitions). Co-orthologs/Ultraparalogs have a strong
probability of sharing a very similar function in both
organisms. They are often related to phenomena of
genetic redundancy, especially when they result from
intra-species duplication by segmental and/or tandem
duplication. However, gene family evolution is not limited to duplication; it can also include gene loss and rearrangement. This complicates inference of orthologous
and paralogous relationships [8] and can even obscure the
definition of boundaries between species for prokaryotes.
Identifying orthologs and distinguishing them from paralogs is the key problem. How can we identify the set of
orthologs between two or more species? The method follows a two-step process. Firstly, protein sequences from at
least two organisms have to be grouped into evolutionarily-related gene families, since the majority of plant protein are encoded by members of multigene families. A
gene family is a cluster containing the complete set of
homologs and only homologs. The problem of accurate
clustering is complex. Most plant gene family databases
published so far are partial and contain only specific families (see for instance [9-11]). This clustering step is a critical issue as misassignment of weakly or non-homologous
sequences will generate a poorly resolved tree as these
sequences are not evolutionarily related. When an accurate catalogue of gene families across species is available,
the second step is to predict orthologous relationships
between family members both within a given family and
across species. Two methods are commonly used, one
based on similarity methods and another using phylogenetic analysis. Pairwise similarity comparisons are commonly achieved using BLAST [12] and have been used to
develop several ortholog databases [13-15]. For multigene
families with recent duplication events, similarity methods fail to distinguish paralogs from orthologs. On the
other hand, phylogenetic analysis of homologs is the
most straightforward way to identify orthologs. This strategy, applied to full genomes, was named phylogenomics
by Dr. Eisen [16,17]. Several powerful tools have recently
been developed specifically for phylogenomics, including

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/183

Resampled Inference of Orthologs (RIO) [18]. RIO uses a
procedure known as "tree reconciliation" and compares
the gene tree to the species tree topology. A minimal
duplication or speciation parsimony principle is then
applied to reconcile both trees [18]. Even if they have
greatly helped to automatically analyze full genomes, all
the phylogenetic methods available are less efficient than
similarity based methods [19,20], suggesting a complex
set of pitfalls in the phylogenetics approach that needs to
be overcome. A full methodology that can be applied on
raw data, i.e. using gene sequences of full plant genomes,
is still missing to our knowledge.
Thus, all methods for orthology prediction, pairwise comparison and phylogenomics suffer from important drawbacks and need to be improved. We developed a full
genome-wide phylogenomics procedure for plant
ortholog predictions including:
(i) An efficient methodology for gene family clustering of
complete genomes with semi-automatic curation.
(ii) A generic and optimized phylogenetic pipeline for
ortholog inference
(iii) A validation method using a test set of orthologs and
paralogs to demonstrate that our strategy outperforms
ortholog predictions of pairwise methods.
This procedure was successfully applied to predict
orthologs between complete Arabidopsis thaliana and
Oryza sativa genomes and will be a guideline for future
complete plant genomes ortholog predictions. Future
extensions of this procedure to integrate new plant
genomes are also discussed.

Results
Genome-wide search for plant homolog gene families
Genome-wide clustering of homologs in gene families
We first evaluated GCD [21] and PlantTribes [22] as gene
family databases for phylogenomic inference. These two
plant gene family databases were constructed recently
using an automatic clustering approach. The GCD database uses two complementary approaches to produce A.
thaliana/O. sativa clusters. The first applies BLASTCLUST
[12] while the second uses a PFAM domain combination
[23]. PlantTribes presents A. thaliana/O. sativa/P. Trichocarpa gene clusters developed with the TribeMCL software [24]. This method relies on the Markov cluster
(MCL) algorithm for the assignment of proteins to families based on pre-computed sequence similarity information. Transcription factor (TF) clusters from GCD and
PlantTribes were compared to 45 TF gene families of
DATF/DRTF [9,10]. DATF and DRTF are manually curated
plant transcription factor databases for A. thaliana [10]

and Oryza sativa [9] respectively. A simple parameter was
defined to compare completeness and presence of nonhomologous sequences in GCD and PlantTribes clusters.
Firstly, we identified the GCD and PlantTribes clusters
containing the largest number of sequences for each TF
family. A cluster was declared incomplete when the
number of sequences it contained was below 50% of that
in corresponding DATF/DRTF gene family. Similarly, a
cluster was declared to contain non-homologous
sequences when additional gene members represented
more than 50% of the original size of the gene family in
DATF/DRTF [9,10].
Different TF gene families were subdivided into several
clusters in GCD and PlantTribes. Even with the lowest
BlastClust identity parameter (35%) the cluster efficiency
of BlastClust was rather poor (Table 1). We found nine
incomplete families suggesting that most of the gene family members were separated into several small clusters.
The PFAM strategy was more efficient as only two families
were subdivided compared to DATF/DRTF. Several clusters contain non-homologous sequences in GCD and
PlantTribes. Six clusters, all containing multi-domain proteins, contained a large proportion of non-homologous
sequences in GCD (PFAM clustering strategy). As this
strategy groups sequences with a similar PFAM combination, this can lead to incorrect clustering when a domain
does not define itself as a gene family or when there is no
protein domain identified for a given gene family. In
PlantTribes, four families (Table 1) also contained nonhomologous sequences. Thus, we estimated that GCD
and PlantTribes could not be used directly for phylogenomic inference. TribesMCL performs better than the
BlastClust and PFAM approach, but there are still some
clusters subdivided in PlantTribes compared to DATF/
DRTF.
The incompleteness of TF in PlantTribes can be corrected
using relaxed TribesMCL parameters. Two major parameters are used for gene clustering in TribesMCL: the classical
BLASTALL E-value and the Inflation value. The Inflation
value is an indirect indication of "tightness" of clustering,
such that the higher the inflation, the more stringent the
clustering [24,25]. Several combinations of BLASTALL E
and Inflation values were tested. We evaluated the completeness of the automatic clustering procedure by comparing the TF families described in DATF and DRTF with
clusters automatically generated by the TribeMCL procedure with the relaxed parameters (BLASTALL = 10, I =
1.2). In the DATF and DRTF databases, 63 families of TFs
are described. The automatic clustering with relaxed
parameters procedure generated 45 families (71%) in full
concordance with DATF and DRTF databases (Additional
File 1) and all of the families identified as badly clustered

before (Table 1) in GCD and PlantTribes were correctly
assigned.
Manual curation and mapping of At/Os clusters to plant gene
families
Clusters generated by TribesMCL were manually mapped
to gene families using external evidence including various
databases (TAIR, DATF/DRTF, INTERPRO families,
KEGG) and in a few cases publications describing plant
gene families. Curation of the automatically generated
clusters was then always necessary; for instance in TF families, 14% of the clusters in one-to-one correspondence
with DATF/DRTF were identified at inflation values
greater than 1.2 (Additional File 1). Gene family assignment of several thousand clusters was done easily using a
custom annotation database developed specifically for
this purpose [26]. The curation procedure starts by analysing all clusters produced at the inflation value 1.2. For
instance, cluster 308 contains all TUB/TLP plant transcription sequences based on the INTERPRO domain
IPR000007 and was annotated as the TUB/TLP Transcription factor gene family (Figure 1A), while cluster 137 contains sequences from two separate gene families (Figure
1B) and thus does not represent a unique gene family. All
sequences in cluster 137 belong to two sub-clusters at a
higher inflation value (I = 2) and which correspond
clearly to two gene families: one composed of proteins of
unknown function DUF246 (INTERPRO family domain
IPR004348) and the Rhamnogalacturonate lyase family
(INTERPRO family domain IPR010325) (see Figure 1B).
Global family assignment followed a similar process: we
first curated all clusters generated at the lowest inflation
value (I = 1.2) and if a cluster clearly contained sequences
from different families, sub-clusters were curated. The
procedure was repeated until we obtained clusters matching gene families.

A total of 21,038 gene clusters were assembled using the
TribesMCL pipeline software at four levels of inflation. Up
to now, 6,421 clusters have been manually annotated
including 64 from DRTF [9] and DATF [10] TF databases,
492 from TAIR [27], 1,903 from the INTERPRO family list
[28] and 981 from the KEGG [29] database. The most
probable molecular function (or putative molecular function) was tentatively attributed to each gene family. During the manual curation, we also identified speciesspecific clusters (either O. sativa or A. thaliana). We considered that a cluster was species-specific if at least two
sequences belonging to a single species were grouped
together at the lowest inflation value (I = 1.2). As such, we
found 703 O. sativa and 116 Arabidopsis thaliana specific
clusters. In several cases, these families were already
defined as species-specific based on the family's INTERPRO domain. For example, the ASR family is missing in A.
thaliana and we identified an O. sativa specific cluster

clusters. Semi-automatic production of gene families was
easily achieved in a short time, creating the largest existing
catalogue of plant gene families (6421). All clusters from
A. thaliana and Oryza sativa containing more than three
sequences and generated at lower inflation values (I = 1.2)
were annotated. The full catalogue is accessible at GreenPhylDB database [26].
Genome-wide search for plant orthologs
Our goal was to design an optimal phylogenomics pipeline to predict orthologs not only between A. thaliana and
O. sativa, but also with other plant species. We had to
develop model alignments as we started from gene families and not from a source of curated alignment as in
PFAM [23]. One of the critical problems was to automatically eliminate and filter misannotated sequences in a
given gene family to build an optimal model alignment.
This filtering step eliminated alternatively-spliced products and misannotated or too highly divergent sequences.
The alignment procedure should allow alignment of conserved regions separated by large gaps, but also of relatively divergent sequences as most of the curated gene
families are multi-domain containing proteins. A specific

masking step had to be included in order to optimize the
alignment for phylogenetic construction by removing
poorly informative amino-acid positions.
Greenphyl phylogenomics pipeline
GreenPhyl is a pipeline written in Perl using 15 different
types of software, including several custom C software
programs (Figure 2). GreenPhyl input is a multi-fasta file
with gene identifiers tagged with a species code. As output, GreenPhyl generates all the ortholog predictions for
each sequence contained in the original multi-fasta file.
Compared to already published phylogenomic pipelines,
three steps were substantially modified.

Misclassified or incomplete sequences have significant
impact on phylogenomic constructions. These divergent
sequences are interpreted as sequences that evolve more
rapidly compared to other family members. This will
cause Long Branch Attraction (LBA) effects during tree
construction, either due to unequal rates of evolution or
annotation errors. Thus, they have to be automatically
identified and rejected for each family. We added an automatic filtering step combining the Muscle [30] and LEON

successively fixed as a "family model sequence" and tested
against all other family members using LEON. This
method, which gives as output a list of "non-homologous
sequences," has been applied to each analysed family. We
considered as non-homologous a gene rejected by more
than 96% of other family members. This filtering step
rejected on average 60% (computed on 56 TF families) of
misannoted TF sequences, based on the absence of the
typical TF INTERPO domain. For example, this method
rejects 100% of non-homologous sequences in the GRAS
family (8 sequences) and 85% in the MADS family (25

sequences). Sequences that shared a degenerate domain
or did not contain the typical domain were easily detected
by the LEON filtering system as they could not be aligned
correctly with other family members. This filtering system
also deals with multi-domain family problems. In the
MADS family for instance, the K-box domain
(IPR002487) is always associated with the MADS domain.
The LEON filtering system rejected the 10 sequences that
only present the K-box domain without the MADS
domain. Finally, for each locus, we kept only the splicing
form with the best similarity score with all other family

members as estimated by the Checksum value of the
multi-sequences Format (MSF).
Multi-alignment is one of the major steps in phylogenomic construction. The objective is to identify and align
the characteristic domains of the gene families. Many
alignment algorithms exist. Our objective was to select a
program able to align multi-domain families. We selected
MAFFT [32-34] with the E-INS-i option that can align conserved regions separated by large gaps or very divergent
sequences, a feature needed for multi-domain alignment
[35]. This method has been successfully tested (CPU time
and accuracy) by computer simulations and the BAliBASE
[36] benchmark tests in comparison with several existing
methods. The RASCAL program [37] was used to optimize
the multiple alignment produced by MAFFT. This
improvement was also quantified on a BAliBASE test set.
Moreover, MAFFT offers a range of multiple alignment
methods including alignment of a very large number of
sequences, a feature needed either for very large multigene
families or when a large number of species is employed.
Finally, we applied a masking procedure to the optimized
alignment to detect and remove amino acid columns/
positions containing either no or a low phylogenetic signal. Our workflow uses a modified version of the AL2CO
software for calculation of positional conservation [38].
The amino acid positions retained for phylogenetic constructions share a minimum conservation index of 2
together with a percentage of gaps below 50%. The multialignment process was designed to run with any kind of
gene family structure, from single domain to multidomain containing proteins. We additionally generated a
full-length HMM profile from the RASCAL optimised
alignment with the HMMER package [39] to provide a
simple way to identify new members of the gene family in
the future using a library of HMM profiles.
PHYML [40] is one of the fastest maximum-likelihood
tree reconstruction methods for generation of large trees
with an acceptable CPU computing time. PHYML first
constructs a BioNJ tree using the Neighbor-Joining tree
algorithm and then optimizes this tree to improve its likelihood by successive iteration. The SDI unrooted method
[41] from the RIO package [18] was used to root the generated gene trees. Finally, we looped DoRIO [18] on bootstrapped rooted trees for ortholog inference for each
sequence. We also developed a new plant species tree,
based on a RIO [18] published tree and including the top
100 plant species based on NBCI rankings using the
number of stored sequences in NCBI (see Additional files
2 &3).

Validation of the phylogenomics procedure using an ortholog test set
and comparison with pairwise methods
Even if the phylogenomics approach was theoretically the
most powerful methodology to predict orthologs, up to
now the most efficient approaches have been pairwise
methods [19,20]. In order to demonstrate that our phylogenomics methodology outperforms pairwise methods,
we compared ortholog predictions against a test set of
manually curated orthologs.

We first reviewed the literature to find ortholog evidence
between Oryza sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana (true positives). We then extracted and compared ortholog predictions for these genes from three methods, BBMH (Best
Blast Mutual Hits) and Inparanoid [42] which are methods based on pairwise comparisons and GreenPhyl (Table
2). A total of 35 true positive orthologous relationships
(according to our counting procedure: See Materials and
Methods) were selected from bibliographic references,
including 11 one-to-one, six one-to- two and two two-tothree relationships. GreenPhyl predicted 37 orthologous
relationships and missed three, Inparanoid predicted 23
and missed 14, while BBMH predicted only 17 orthologous relationships and missed 18. Thus, our phylogenomics pipeline outperformed Inparanoid and BBMH
methods, especially for several-to-several orthologous
relationships for which the similarity methods often miss
some or all ultraparalogs. Ultraparalog definitions from
Zmasek are as follows [18]: "Given a rooted gene tree with
duplication or speciation assigned to each of its internal
nodes, two sequences are ultra-paralogous if and only if
the smallest subtree containing them both contains only
internal nodes representing duplications" (see also materials and methods for Zmasek definitions).
We also identified 'true negative' orthologous relationships from the literature. These represent a set of genes
known to be species-specific with no orthologous relationships to the other species (Table 3). In this particular
case, GreenPhyl easily identifies ultraparalog relationships when no orthologs are detected. For example,
GreenPhyl predicted that LHS1 is a rice-specific gene associated with 2 additional ultraparalogs (Table 3). In Arabidopsis thaliana, the flowering locus (FLC) has no ortholog
in rice, but several closely related Arabidopsis thaliana ultraparalogs were identified (MAF-like for MADS affecting
flowering) and are known to be involved together with
FLC in the flowering pathway [43]. BBMH and Inparanoid
incorrectly predicted an orthologous relationship for the
Arabidopsis thaliana gene VRN1 (Table 3). These results
suggest that absence of prediction by GreenPhyl is correct
and this is a true negative. Moreover, GreenPhyl predicted
15 additional rice sequences as ultraparalogs.

Thus, our phylogenomics pipeline achieves the highest
number of ortholog predictions with good overlap of predictions by similarity methods. We ran the GreenPhyl
pipeline on 56 TF families (3314 genes) validated by our
clustering procedure and compared the results with Inparanoid and BBMH predictions (Figure 3, and see additional file 4). These analyses predicted a total of 1637
non-redundant ortholog relationships: 567 by BBMH,
732 by Inparanoid and 1280 by GreenPhyl. Since BBMH
only finds one-to-one (1/1) relationships, ortholog prediction using this method is obviously underestimated.
Inparanoid slightly outperforms BBMH by 22% while
GreenPhyl predicts approximately twice as many
orthologs when compared with any other similarity
method. In total, 77% of the 1637 ortholog predictions
are detected by GreenPhyl, 45% by Inparanoid and 35%
by BBMH. Moreover, 65% and 60% of the BBMH and
Inparanoid predictions are achieved by GreenPhyl, while

all similarity methods together can achieve only 40% of
the GreenPhyl predictions. GreenPhyl-specific predictions
represent the highest proportion of the non-redundant set
(775, 47%) followed by Inparanoid (155, 9.4%) and
BBMH (65, 4%).
As GreenPhyl detected a greater number of orthologous
relationships, we asked why it is more efficient than Inparanoid and whether these additional orthologs are bona
fide orthologs. Firstly, as the threshold applied for Inparanoid and GreenPhyl was arbitrary fixed at 50%, we asked
whether some of the orthologs specifically detected by
GreenPhyl or Inparanoid were in fine detected by the
other methods at slightly lower threshold values. A total
of 18% (141) of the supplementary orthologs, detected
originally by GreenPhyl, were identified by Inparanoid
using a 30% threshold. Similarly, 30% (87) of the

orthologs detected by Inparanoid are recovered by GreenPhyl using a 30% threshold.
Nevertheless, GreenPhyl detects 649 orthologous relationships never found by any similarity based method
even at lower thresholds. These GreenPhyl-specific predic-

tions could have two origins. They could be due to a more
efficient detection of complex orthologous relationships
corresponding to intra-specific duplications (Figure 4)
with multiple co-orthologs. Alternatively, these orthologs
could be totally new predictions. In order to obtain better
insight on specific ortholog prediction by GreenPhyl, we
classified these predictions in two classes:
(i) If one method predicts an n1/n2 orthologous relationship and the other method predicts an n3/n4 relationship,
then "extended orthologs" are n1/n2 relationships not
included in n3/n4 ones (see Figure 4).
(ii) If one method predicts an n1/n2 orthologous relationship never predicted by the other method, then the
new orthologs are considered as "in-specific orthologs"
We evaluated the number of 'extended' and 'in-specific'
orthologs for Inparanoid and GreenPhyl using the list of
56 TF families previously used (additional file 5). A total
of 680 orthologs (486 extended orthologs and 194 in-specific orthologs) predicted by GreenPhyl are missing in
Inparanoid while 171 (4 extended orthologs and 167 inspecific orthologs) predicted by Inparanoid are missing in
GreenPhyl. Strikingly, 2% (4) of the Inparanoid orthologs
missed by GreenPhyl are "extended orthologs" while 71%
(486) of the GreenPhyl orthologs missed by Inparanoid
are "extended orthologs". So GreenPhyl seems to deal better with more complex relationships and is able to identify co-ortholog relationships for each species.

Nevertheless, we decided to evaluate if these additional
co-orthologs correspond to true co-ortholog predictions.

tandem duplication information was downloaded from
TIGR and OryGenesDB, respectively (additional file 6)

and we evaluated how many of these intra-species duplications are detected as ultraparalogs and in-paralogs by
GreenPhyl and Inparanoid respectively. If most of the coorthologs detected specifically by GreenPhyl really correspond to intra-species duplications, we expect to identify
most of the tandem and segmental duplications as GreenPhyl Ultraparalog predictions. A total of 2228 ultraparalogs were recovered by GreenPhyl for the 56 TF families
(additional file 6). By data mining of TIGR and OryGenesDB datasets, we identified 705 and 211 segmental and
tandem duplicated genes in these 56 TF families. Approximately 70% of the segmental and 78% of the tandemlyduplicated genes were predicted to be ultraparalogs by
GreenPhyl as expected while Inparanoid detects only
7.5% of the segmental and 5.7% of the tandem duplications. These results suggest that GreenPhyl is more efficient than Inparanoid in identifying co-ortholog
relationships. Moreover, these results strongly suggest that
most of the specific orthologs predicted by GreenPhyl are
true co-orthologs resulting from intra-species duplications, most of which are missed by Inparanoid. These
results indirectly validate most of the specific co-orthologs
predicted by GreenPhyl and missed by Inparanoid.

Discussion
We have successfully developed a complete procedure for
ortholog prediction between complete Arabidopsis thaliana
and Oryza sativa genomes. Our strategy includes a simple
and fast semi-automatic clustering step and avoids most
of the common pitfalls of other clustering procedures.
Several others clustering procedures have been described.
For instance, RIO [18] starts from PFAM [23] as a source
of curated alignments. This strategy has several drawbacks. Firstly, PFAM domains do not always define gene
families, as several domains are in fact structural or repeat
domains (for instance Leucine Rich Repeat, LRR domain
PF00560). Moreover, some gene family members, even
for fully sequenced genomes, are not systematically integrated in PFAM. These missing members increase the
probability of generating pseudo-ortholog predictions as
they are equivalent to species specific gene loss (see
below). Moreover, PFAM clusters contain sequences from
bacteria, animals and plants. Tree constructions using
such a wide range of species can lower the efficiency of
ortholog predictions. Based on this, another strategy was
to develop a procedure for automatic clustering of full
genomes like GCD and PlantTribes. We demonstrated
that these methods are not directly suitable for phylogenomic analysis as they contain high proportion of clusters
with non-homologous sequences and/or incomplete gene

families (see results for GCD [21] and PlantTribes [22]
databases). A third solution, used, for instance for the
COG database [44], is to create groups of homologs by
manual inspection. This procedure is time consuming and
is efficient only for already well-defined gene families.
Using our simple semi-automatic procedure of clustering,
we easily achieved full A. thaliana/O. sativa cluster curation as gene families suitable for phylogenomics analysis.
These gene families are accessible at GreenPhylDB database [26]. Lastly, even when starting with complete
genome sequence, our clustering procedure applied in
complete genomes can also miss some genes either not yet
characterized or annotated. The only way to correct this
problem in future is to update the gene family clusters
using newly annotated sequences. Our methodology can
now be easily extended to other plant sequences and we
plan to release a new update of gene family clusters each
year as well as the gene family phylogeny in order to correct progressively clustering and orthologs predictions. A
simple way is to use the HMM gene family patterns generated on gene family model alignments to assign new plant
sequences to curated gene families.
We have developed a phylogenomic pipeline to analyse
curated gene families. Some gene models automatically
predicted from BAC/PAC sequences are inaccurately predicted, especially in O. sativa where the quality of genome
annotation is less accurate than in A. thaliana [45,46]. For
instance, some can still contain transposon elements.
Thus, our pipeline was specifically developed to reject
these sequences before gene multi-alignment to optimize
phylogenetic inference. Phylogenomics procedures,
including our procedure, generally do not account for
uncertainty in the sequence alignment. Several studies
(see for instance [47]), including a recent systematic evaluation of sequence alignment uncertainty for phylogenomics [48], have demonstrated that alignment method
has a considerable impact on tree topology. Even if we
solved partially this problem by automatically rejecting
highly divergent or missannoted sequences and if we
choose one of the best alignment software, a set of the
alignments generated will be inconsistent. This is neither
a problem a data quality nor a problem of alignment analysis but reflects the fact that the phylogenomics analysis
does not accommodate with alignment uncertainty [47].
A significant part of the genes will be hard to align and
this will result to uncertainty in phylogeny as well as in
orthologs inference. There is no simple solution to this
problem to date and this is clearly a limitation of the procedure for some of the gene families. A suggested way to
solve this problem is to consider alignment as a random
variable, a strategy developed into the statistical alignment procedure [49,50].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/183

The phylogenomic pipeline can then be applied directly
to a multi-fasta file containing sequences from any gene
family. We developed an extended species tree of life,
including 100 new plant species, for the tree reconciliation procedure of RIO based on NCBI taxonomy data (see
additional data file 1). Recently, several other tree reconciliation software programs have been proposed. These
methods do not deal with alignment bootstrapping, but
use Bayesian statistics [51] to infer orthologous relations.
They share several advantages compared to bootstrapping
procedures. They seem to outperform bootstrapping
methodology as Bayesian methods also tend to deal with
errors in data: a major drawback of all gene tree related
methods for ortholog prediction (see for instance [51]).
Introduction of bootstrapping alternatives like Bayesian
statistics for ortholog inference [51] will be tested and
implemented in the next release of the pipeline GreenPhyl
as we did not yet evaluated this strategy for genome-wide
detection of orthologs. The phylogenomic pipeline is
accessible as stand alone software [52]. We also recently
release a database, GreenPhylDB containing all the
precomputed orthologs predictions and the associated
tools [26].
We validated our phylogenomics prediction using three
curated test sets and demonstrated that our approach
clearly outperforms pairwise methods previously
described as the most efficient ortholog prediction tools
[19,20]. Gene tree construction is very sensitive to annotation errors and the efficiency of our phylogenomics
pipeline is mainly due to the sequences used and the
alignment filtering steps. They reject non-homologous or
dissimilar sequences before construction of the gene family alignment. Despite these validations on moderate samples, how many ortholog predictions represent 'true'
ortholog relations? There is no simple way to evaluate this
figure. Indeed, numerous evolutionary events including
horizontal gene transfer, gene loss, gene fusion and gene
fission can lead to pseudo-ortholog predictions [7]. For
instance, differential gene loss in a species can lead to
pseudo-ortholog predictions and the only way to infer
correct orthologous relationships is to reconstruct the evolution of the gene family including a larger sample of species.
Integrating new plant genomes is then not only needed to
correct for the pseudo-ortholog bias described above, but
it can also help functional transfer from and to model
plant species. Initially, we planned to cluster and run phylogenomic analyses in four plant genomes, but we rapidly
observed that annotation quality was a major limiting
point. Even for the O. sativa genome, we observed numerous misannotated sequences rejected by our filtering system such as transposon elements containing proteins or
truncated gene models that greatly hamper clustering and

ortholog inference. For instance, we only used the complete genome annotation of the japonica cultivar Nipponbare [4], presuming that the indica 93–11 indica WGS
genome annotations were less advanced [53] even if a new
release has recently been made available [54]. The introduction of newly sequenced genomes, most in the assembly phase, was delayed and we are currently testing two
different approaches to integrate new full plant genomes.
A first possibility is to produce new model alignments by
running the pipeline with A. thaliana, O. sativa and the
sequences coming from other genomes for each gene family. This strategy is time consuming to compute, and producing new fully bootstrapped alignments and matrix
genetics distances will rapidly become impossible for
large multigene families as new complete plant genomes
sequences are added. Introduction of bootstrapping alternatives like Bayesian statistics for ortholog inference [51]
will probably become more critical with this strategy.
Another simple method involving less computing time is
to build an alignment model only for a few plant species,
including A. thaliana and O. sativa, and re-align the new
family members. By using precomputed genetic distances,
these new sequences can be integrated into the previously
computed tree. This strategy was initially introduced in
RIO [18] and can probably safely be used to add a few
sequences in a model alignment. However, the validity of
this approach to integrate sequences for a larger sequence
sample needs to be tested, at least for large and small multigenic families. We are currently testing this strategy on a
large set of gene families before implementation of this
procedure. Nevertheless, currently any user can also
decide to run our standalone pipeline version on their set
of plant sequences.

Conclusion
We have developed a simple and fast procedure for
ortholog prediction between complete genomes, including semi-automatic gene family clustering and an optimised standalone phylogenomic pipeline. The
phylogenomic pipeline can be download at [52] or
request from the authors'. The precomputed ortholog predictions and curated gene families for the complete
genomes of A. thaliana and O. sativa are accessible at
GreenPhylDB, a database published in a companion
paper [26].

Arabidopsis thaliana [58] respectively. The full list of tandem duplicated genes was extracted from the 'paralog
clusters' feature layer of OryGenesDB [59].
Family clustering
Clustering
To begin, all protein sequences from Oryza sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana genomes were grouped into gene families
using TribeMCL [24]. This software uses a Markov cluster
(MCL) algorithm for grouping proteins into families
based on a pre-computed sequence pairwise similarity
matrix. We used several TribeMCL parameters Inflation
(1.2, 2, 3 and 5) and BLAST E-values (E = 10) for family
clustering. Then, for each sequence, low complexity
regions were masked using the CAST software [60].
Finally, InterproScan was used to identify protein
domains for all genes [28].
Filtering
We used an automatic filter to remove the most divergent
sequences inside each cluster. A pre-alignment was generated with the MUSCLE alignment software [30] to select
the optimal splice form using the best Checksum value.
Then, LEON [31] was used to remove highly divergent
sequences from the alignment. Each sequence was successively fixed as a "family model sequence" and LEON produced an output list of "non-homologous sequences." We
loop LEON for all the sequences of the family and automatically removed the sequences rejected by more than
96% of other family members.
Phylogenomic analysis
GreenPhyl Pipeline
Figure 2 summarizes the GreenPhyl workflow and the
description of softwares included in the pipeline.
Alignment
A full alignment with the filtered sequences was produced
with MAFFT using the E-INS-i MAFFT option [35]. The
RASCAL program [37] optimizes the multi-alignment
produced by MAFFT. We applied AL2CO software for calculation of positional conservation to mask the generated
optimal alignment [38]. The amino acid columns retained
for phylogenetic constructions shared a minimum conservation index of 2 together with a percentage of gaps below
50%.

Tree construction
PHYML [40] first constructs a BioNJ tree using the Neighbor-Joining tree algorithm and then optimizes this tree to
improve the likelihood at each iteration.
Identification of speciation and duplication events
We used the Resampled Inference of Orthologs (RIO) procedure to detect orthologs [18]. RIO is based on a bootstrap resampling method to check robustness of ortholog
predictions based on the phylogenetic tree. The SDI
unrooted algorithm [41] was first used to predict speciation and duplication events. Orthologs, ultraparalogs and
subtree-neighboring predictions for each sequence of the
tree were generated using the DoRIO procedure. We used
ATV JAVA software [61] to display phylogenetic trees with
the bootstrap values calculated by DoRIO. Paralog and
ortholog associations were considered to be significant if
the supporting bootstrap value is above 50%.
Phylogenomics concepts
There is more than just ortholog prediction, and three
new concepts were defined as super-orthologs, ultra-paralogs and subtree-neighbors by Dr Zmasek [18].
Super-orthologs
"Given a rooted gene tree with duplication or speciation
assigned to each of its internal nodes, two sequences are
super-orthologous if and only if each internal node on
their connecting path represents a speciation event."
Super-othologs are orthologs in one-to-one correspondence. Super-orthologs represent then a subset of its
orthologs for a given sequence. They have the highest
probability of sharing a similar function in several species
and can be used with high confidence for a direct annotation transfer.
Ultraparalogs
"Given a rooted gene tree with duplication or speciation
assigned to each of its internal nodes, two sequences are
ultra-paralogous if and only if the smallest subtree containing them both contains only internal nodes representing duplications." Ultraparalogs are mostly paralogs that
have undergone recent duplications in a given species,
either by tandem or segmental duplications. Annotation
transfert between ultraparalogs is more efficient than
between orthologous sequences. It is also relevant for
functional analysis as ultraparalogs likely share a similar
function and are often involved in functional redundancy
and/or neofunctionnalization.
Ortholog prediction by similarity methods
Reciprocal Best Hit (RBH) or Best Blast Mutual Hit (BBMH)
This blast-based method is currently the one most frequently used to find one-to-one relationships. It assumes
that a reciprocal best hit association between two species

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/183

proteins defines an ortholog pair. We downloaded 1/1
relationships obtained by BBMH from the OryGenesDB
database (E-value cutoff of 0.1) [59,62].
Inparanoid
Inparanoid is based on pairwise similarity values calculated in four ways: A/B, B/A, A/A, B/B. Orthologous
sequences were detected according to both homology and
length cut-off. Orthologs were clustered around the main
orthologs for each species (in-paralogs). A confidence
value based on bootstrapping technique was assigned for
each in-paralog relationship and for each ortholog group
itself. We ran Inparanoid [63] on Oryza sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana whole proteomes (91730 sequences). We
only retained ortholog predictions (in-paralogs and outparalogs) with a bootstrap threshold above 50%.
Ortholog counting procedure
In order to compare the different prediction methods
GreenPhyl, Inparanoid and BBMH, we assumed that predictions are identical between two or three methods when
several splice forms of the same locus are predicted as
orthologs. For BBMH, all the ortholog predictions are 1/1
relations, but for Inparanoid and GreenPhyl most of them
are n1 sequences of A. thaliana orthologs to n2 rice
sequences. The counting score of an orthologous relationship is computed as n1*n2.
Hardware
GreenPhyl runs on an AIX system at the National Computer Center of Higher Education [64] in a multi-job manner
using IBM P1600 Power4 node clusters of 16.

List of abbreviations used
BBMH: Best Blast Mutual Hit; RBH: Reciprocal Best Hit;
