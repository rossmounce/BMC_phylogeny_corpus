Abstract
We report on a rare case of pulmonary Nocardiosis and brain abscess caused by Nocardia
otitidiscaviarum in an elderly woman with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Taxonomic
identification involved phenotypic testing, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), and
complete 16S rRNA gene sequencing.

Case report
An 85-year-old female living in a rural area with a history
of hypertension, coronary disease, and severe to very
severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
was admitted to hospital with increasing dyspnea, cough,
whitish sputum, and pleuritic chest pain on her right side.
She had been on treatment with prednisone for eighteen
months, after which treatment was switched to deflazacort (15 mg/day) two months prior to suffer two COPD
exacerbations. At admission, the patient presented a Barthel Index of 60; her temperature was 37.3°C with 89%
oxygen saturation, while breathing ambient air. Spirometric examination demonstrated severe airway obstruction
with a forced vital capacity (FVC) of 1.2 L, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) of 0.53 L, and FEV1/FVC of
44%. She had diminished breathing sounds and inspira-

tory crackles in the lower half of both lungs. Physical and
neurological examinations were unremarkable.
Laboratory analyses yielded the following: hemoglobin
concentration, 10.7 g; WBC, 22800 (92% neutrophils, 2%
lymphocytes); platelet count, 518000; creatinine concentration, 0.92 mg/dl; glycemia, 180 mg/dl, and urinary protein, 80 mg/dl. Chest computed tomography (CT)
revealed an interstitial distribution of multiple pulmonary nodules, fluid in the major fissure, and a small pleural effusion (Figure 1A). A contrast-enhanced CT scan of
the head revealed three nodular lesions in the left frontoparietal lobe with perilesional vasogenic edema, highly
suggestive of brain abscess (Figure 1B).
Repeated sputum and blood cultures were negative. Pleural fluid was obtained by puncture and microscopic exam-

revealed
numerous
polymorphonuclear
leucocytes and modified acid fast positive, filamentousbranched, gram-positive rods. The growth from the specimen, which had been cultured on blood and chocolate
agar plates displayed dry, irregular, adherent, white colonies after 72 h incubation at 37°C. The isolate was initially characterized on the basis of routine phenotypic test
results such as colonial morphology, positive Gram stain;
positive catalase test; growth in nutrient broth with lysozyme; reduction of nitrate; hydrolysis of xanthine,
hypoxanthine and urea, and the inability to hydrolyze
casein and tyrosine [1]. The enzymatic profile obtained by
API ZYM (BioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) exhibited
negative reactions to valine arylamidase, N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase, and α-mannosidase. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed simultaneously by Kirby
Bauer disc diffusion [2] and E-tests (AB Biodisk, Sweden),
following the protocol described by Martin et al., 2004,
for other actinomycetes (Streptomyces) [3]. A suspension
of the microorganism, with turbidity equivalent to 1.0
McFarland standard, was inoculated (150 μl/plate) by
confluent swabbing on Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA)
plates. A maximum of two E-test strips were applied to
each MHA plate, which were then incubated at 35°C for 3
days. MICs were determined according to manufacturer's

guidelines. Susceptibility results were as follows: penicillin G > 256 μg/ml; ampicillin > 256 μg/ml; imipenem
0.75 μg/ml; vancomycin 32 μg/ml; erythromycin 64 μg/
ml; linezolid 0.5 μg/ml; trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) 0.75 μg/ml; gentamycin 0.25 μg/ml;
amikacin 0.75 μg/ml, and ciprofloxacin 0.50 μg/ml.
After a tentative diagnosis of pulmonary nocardiosis, the
patient was treated with TMP/SMX (2400/480 mg/day)
and imipenem (4 g/day iv) for ten days. However, due to
tonic-clonic convulsions, the imipenem was switched to
oral linezolid 600 mg/12 h and dexamethasone 10 mgbolus followed by 4 mg iv every 6 h. The patient developed anemia and thrombocytopenia after one week, and
linezolid was therefore discontinued. The patient expired
one month after admission. At autopsy, specimens from
pleural fluid and the cerebral abscess were taken and cultured. Nocardia growth was observed and confirmed by
subculture and microscopy: colonies had a brown velvety
appearance, branching filaments were visible microscopically (0.5–1.2 μm diameter), that often fragment into rodto coccoid shaped forms.
In order to characterize the Nocardia isolates from pleural
fluid and the brain abscess, the 16S rRNA gene (1500 bp)

was amplified. The 16S rRNA gene from both isolates was
amplified using the primers pA: 5'-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3' and pH: 5'-AAGGAGGTGATCCAGCCGCA3'. PCR was performed using a reaction mixture containing 1× PCR buffer; 0.2 mM (each) dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and
dCTP; 0.2 mM of each primer; 2 U of EcoTaq DNA
polymerase (Ecogen, TaKaRa Biotechnology, Japan), and
ultrapure water to a final volume of 50 μl. PCR amplification was performed in a DNA thermal cycler (MJ Research
Inc., MA, USA) and included initial denaturation at 94°C
for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of amplification (94°C
for 1 min, 57°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 2 min) followed
by a 10-min extension at 72°C. PCR products were visualized by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium
bromide staining. Bands corresponding to 16S rRNA gene
were purified using the GFX™ PCR DNA and Gel Band
Purification Kit (Amersham Biosciences, NY, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions. In order to obtain
preliminary information about both isolates the 16S
rRNAs were analyzed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) with HaeIII and AluI restriction endonucleases (TaKaRa Biotechnology) [4]. An aliquot of each
of the PCR-amplified 16S rRNA genes was digested at
37°C for 4 h and the resulting restriction fragments were
separated on a 3% agarose electrophoresis gel. The restriction patterns obtained after digestion were identical in
both strains (data not shown), strongly suggesting that the
two isolates corresponded to the same microorganism.
After that, and with the aim of confirming or refuting, the
identity between both isolates, the full 16S rRNA amplified genes were sequenced. Sequencing was performed
using the pA and pH primers (see above) and the BigDye®
Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit
using an ABI Prism™ 3100 Genetic Analyzer (PerkinElmer
Inc., NY, USA) to electrophorese the sequence product.
The Sequence Scanner v1.0 (Applied Biosystems Foster
City, CA, USA) and BioEdit (v5.0.6) programs were used
to analyze the sequence data thereby derived. Sequencing
data were queried against sequences in the GenBank
and
EMBL
http://
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
www.ebi.ac.uk/embl/index.html databases using the
BLASTN program. The partial sequences of the 16S rRNA
genes from these isolates (1,450 bp; GenBank accession
no. EU203569 and EU203570) shared maximum identity
(100%) with the 16S rRNA from Nocardia otitidiscaviarum
strain DSM 44565 (GenBank accession no. AF430068),
99.9% identity with N. otitidiscaviarum type strain DSM
43242T (GenBank accession no. AF430067) and 98%
with other Nocardia species such as Nocardia nova (GenBank accession no. AB162789). An alignment of the 16S
rRNA sequences from both isolates with DSM 43242T type
strain displayed a 99.9% identity (only one base difference). This allowed the identification of the pleural fluid
and the cerebral abscess isolates as N. otitidiscaviarum.

To further characterize taxonomically both Nocardia isolates, a phylogenetic tree of the 16S rRNA was constructed
by using sequences of several clinical Nocardia species.
Pairwise evolutionary distances were computed using
PHYML version 2.4.4 to find the maximum likelihood
(ML) tree. The robustness of the inferred tree was assessed
with bootstrapping (BP; 1000 pseudoreplicates) also
using PHYML http://phylemon.bioinfo.cipf.es/cgi-bin/
phyml.cgi (Figure 2). The N. otitidiscaviarum species isolated in this work (accession no. EU203569 and
EU203570) are grouped with another clinical isolates of
N. otitidiscaviarum (accession no. AF430068, AF430067).
The other N. otitidiscaviarum clinical species, and other
nocardiae species belong to different phylogenetic groups
(see Figure 2 and below).

Discussion
Nocardiosis is an acute or chronic infection caused by aerobic, soil inhabiting actinomycetes of the Nocardia genus.
Patients with nocardiosis are generally debilitated by
other underlying diseases such as cancer, pulmonary
tuberculosis, hematological malignancies, immunosuppressant therapy, or HIV infection [5,6]. Like the case we
report, some patients with pulmonary nocardiosis have
COPD and have often been treated with long-term, highdose corticosteroid therapy. Brain abscess usually arises
from hematogenous spread from a primary lung infection. Nocardial brain abscesses are uncommon (< 2%),
but are the most common non-pulmonary site in disseminated nocardiosis and have been recorded in between 10
and 15% of patients with this infection [5]. To date and
including our case, only six cases of central system nervous infection by N. otitidiscaviarum have been reported in
the literature [5,7-10], without any taxonomic characterization using molecular techniques such as 16S rRNA gene
sequencing.
N. otitidiscaviarum was first recognized in samples taken
from a Sumatran cavy or guinea pig with ear disease [11].
Infections due to N. otitidiscaviarum appear to be quite
rare (3%) compared to those caused by other Nocardia
species and no published reports of human infection
appeared until the mid 1960s. The first systemic infection
in humans was reported in 1974 [7,12]. This low incidence has been attributed either to reduced pathogenicity
or its lower prevalence in soil [5]. It is also possible that N.
otitidiscaviarum infections are more common, but not
properly diagnosed, as postulated by Patel et al., [13]. This
has also been the case with other Nocardia species [14,15].
The diagnosis of nocardiosis, based on conventional phenotypic characterization of the strains (chemotaxonomic,
morphology, etc) is very time consuming compared to
genotypic methods [16]. Sequence analysis of the 16S
rRNA gene has become the "gold standard" for identifying

nocardiae isolates at the species level [17]. In our study,
PCR amplification of the complete 16S rRNA gene and
subsequent RFLP analysis enabled us to obtain band patterns for comparison of the different isolates from the
same patient. A 16S rRNA phylogenetic tree has shown
that the N. otitidiscaviarum species isolated in this work
(accession no. EU203569 and EU203570) are grouped
with other clinical isolates of N. otitidiscaviarum (see
above and Figure 2), which correspond to well characterized collection strains (accession no. AF430068 and
AF430067). The two isolates obtained from the reported
patient exhibited identical 16S rRNA gene sequences to
the 16S rRNA gene of N. otitidiscaviarum strain DSM
44565 (accession no. AF430068) previously described as
genotype II of N. otitidiscaviarum [16]. Also, the comparison between 16S rRNA from both isolates and type strain
(accession no. AF430067) resulted in a 99.9% identity.
Therefore, both isolates can be named as N. otitidiscaviarum, although an unambiguous identification to the species level will require additional molecular biological and
phenotyping experiments. The other N. otitidiscaviarum
clinical species reported by other authors belong to different clusters: one comprised of four members (accesion
no. Z82237, Z82234, Z82238, Z82239) and another one
consisting of two (AB201303, AB201298) (Figure 2).
These clusters are separated from the cluster which harbour the N. ottidiscaviarum type strain, suggesting that
more in deep taxonomic studies of the clinically significant species are necessary [13].

lying conditions (the patient's age and chronic diseases),
as well as the development of severe intolerance to antimicrobials. Aspiration or excision of the abscess would
have been necessary to achieve a positive outcome.

TMP/SMX or minocycline are the most frequently used
antibiotics for nocardiosis treatment in localized or mild
cases. Combination therapy with a carbapenem or a thirdgeneration cephalosporin with or without amikacin is
generally recommended for severely ill patients or for
those with central system nervous involvement, in whom
mortality is close to 50% when sulfonamide monotherapy is received [18]. Nonetheless, clinical experience
with linezolid in nocardiosis is limited [19]. The MIC90 for
linezolid was ≤ 4 μg/ml against isolates of N. otitidiscaviarum [20]. This agent was successfully used to treat individuals with nocardiosis, including patients who had
failed therapy with other antimicrobials. These cases have
highlighted the excellent penetration of linezolid into cerebrospinal fluid after intravenous administration of the
drug every 12 h [19]. The overall mortality rate for nocardial brain abscess is 47.8% for N. asteroides infection [21].
In all reported cases of N. otitidiscaviarum brain abscess,
including our case, the patients died despite surgical and/
or antibiotic therapy [7-10] except one case [5] that survived following surgical excision and antibiotic treatment
with imipenem and TMP/SMX. Overall mortality in these
six cases was 83.3%. In the case we report there are, several
factors that may have contributed to the failure to cure the
disease, such as deterioration of this patient due to under-

In summary, to the best of our knowledge this is the first
reported case of N. otitidiscaviarum isolated from a patient
with pulmonary nocardiosis and brain abscess described
and characterized by complete 16S rRNA gene sequencing.
