Abstract
Background: Cichlid fishes have radiated into hundreds of species in the Great Lakes of Africa.
Brightly colored males display on leks and vie to be chosen by females as mates. Strong
discrimination by females causes differential male mating success, rapid evolution of male color
patterns and, possibly, speciation. In addition to differences in color pattern, Lake Malawi cichlids
also show some of the largest known shifts in visual sensitivity among closely related species. These
shifts result from modulated expression of seven cone opsin genes. However, the mechanisms for
this modulated expression are unknown.
Results: In this work, we ask whether these differences might result from changes in
developmental patterning of cone opsin genes. To test this, we compared the developmental
pattern of cone opsin gene expression of the Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus, with that of several
cichlid species from Lake Malawi. In tilapia, quantitative polymerase chain reaction showed that
opsin gene expression changes dynamically from a larval gene set through a juvenile set to a final
adult set. In contrast, Lake Malawi species showed one of two developmental patterns. In some
species, the expressed gene set changes slowly, either retaining the larval pattern or progressing
only from larval to juvenile gene sets (neoteny). In the other species, the same genes are expressed
in both larvae and adults but correspond to the tilapia adult genes (direct development).
Conclusion: Differences in visual sensitivities among species of Lake Malawi cichlids arise through
heterochronic shifts relative to the ontogenetic pattern of the tilapia outgroup. Heterochrony has
previously been shown to be a powerful mechanism for change in morphological evolution. We
found that altering developmental expression patterns is also an important mechanism for altering
sensory systems. These resulting sensory shifts will have major impacts on visual communication
and could help drive cichlid speciation.

Background
Cichlids are a group of rapidly diverging fishes from the
Great Lakes of Africa. Each lake harbors a separate
endemic radiation of hundreds of species, which have
evolved during its recent history. Cichlids are well known
for their diversity of feeding specializations and associated
trophic morphologies, as well as their beautiful array of
color patterns. We have found that their visual systems are
also highly diverse, with some of the most variable visual
pigments known in vertebrates [1,2].
Visual pigments comprise opsin proteins bound to a vitamin A-based chromophore, typically 11-cis retinal. The
amino acid sequence of the opsin determines the spectral
absorbance of the pigment. Spectral tuning of the pigment
occurs through amino acid substitutions at sites directed
into the retinal binding pocket [3]. Visual pigment
absorbance may be tuned to the environment, particularly
in aquatic systems. As water quality or depth varies, visual
pigments evolve to better match the surrounding light
field [4-7]. Owing to the tight correspondence between
opsin sequence and function, opsins are an excellent system for the study of molecular adaptation [8].
Vertebrates have one rod opsin and four classes of cone
opsins [3,9]. The cone opsin genes include very short
wavelength sensitive (SWS1), short wavelength sensitive
(SWS2), rhodopsin-like (RH2) and long wavelength sensitive (LWS) classes. Each covers a unique spectral range
[10,11]. Most fishes have opsin genes from each of these
opsin classes and can, therefore, produce visual pigments
covering a broad spectral range [12-18].
Cichlid fishes possess members of all four cone opsin
classes. Additional gene duplications in several of the
classes have produced seven distinct cone opsin genes
(SWS1, SWS2b, SWS2a, RH2b, RH2aβ, RH2aα and LWS).
Analysis of opsin protein expression in tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus, has shown that these seven genes produce visual pigments which are spectrally distinct from
each other [19]. The corresponding pigments in the Lake
Malawi cichlid Metriaclima zebra match their counterparts
in tilapia with only small spectral shifts (Table 1, see [1]).
Although sequence differences cause subtle changes in
opsin absorbance, rather drastic differences have been

detected in the visual pigments of Lake Malawi cichlids
[1,2,20]. Our previous work has shown that this results
from differential expression of unique subsets of the seven
cone opsin genes [1,21]. For example, M. zebra has visual
pigment peak absorbances (λmax) of 368, 488 and 535
nm, resulting from expression of SWS1, RH2b and RH2a
opsin genes (where RH2a includes both RH2aα and
RH2aβ). In contrast, Dimidiochromis compressiceps has λmax
of 447, 535 and 565 nm as the result of expression of the
SWS2a, RH2a and LWS opsin genes. We have also shown
that tilapia, an outgroup riverine cichlid, expresses each of
the opsin genes during some developmental stage. The
genes utilized by lake cichlids are, therefore, subsets of the
full opsin set retained by tilapia [19]. The mechanism
driving the gene expression changes is not known.
In this work, we examine whether differential expression
results from temporal changes in the developmental
sequence of opsin expression. Heterochronic change in
developmental patterning is a central idea linking evolution and development. Phenotypic diversity resulting
from heterochrony has been demonstrated elegantly for
morphological characters [22-26]. A textbook example is
salamanders of the genus Ambystoma. Here, a decoupling
of the developmental programs controlling body development and gonad maturation result in different adult
forms [27-30]. In neotenic forms, body development is
slowed relative to the gonads such that mature gonads
arise within a larval morphology. Plethodontid salamanders have direct developing forms, where the larval phase
is abandoned such that only adult morphologies occur
throughout development. These ontogenetic programs
can be summarized as differences in the rate or timing of
different aspects of development (Figure 1).
Although changes in developmental programs are most
often associated with morphological differences (size and
shape), heterochronic changes have been identified for a
variety of traits including bone ossification [31,32], brain
differentiation [33], pigment patterning [34] and social
behavior [35]. Sensory systems have not yet been examined in terms of heterochrony. However, the close association between visual system sensitivity and opsin gene
sequence makes this a natural system to examine the role
of developmental timing of opsin gene expression in sensory adaptation.

Impact of heterochronic changes in the rate of change or initial starting conditions of a developmental program on the ontogenetic progression of a phenotypic trait. In comparison with normal trait development (left), neotenic development shows a reduced rate of change (middle). Direct development (right) shows the adult condition at an early
stage with little change in trait value through time.
Studies have shown that visual pigments can differ
between larval and adult fishes [13,36-39] including
ultraviolet/violet pigment shifts in single cones [40-44]
and green/red pigment shifts in double cones [38,41,45].
These ontogenetic shifts could be adaptations to changes
in feeding behavior and/or the photic environment following metamorphosis. Shifts can also be more subtle,
such as the changes in temporal or spatial expression of
RH2 or LWS gene duplicates that are seen early in the
development of zebrafish, Danio rerio [14,46-49].
We do not expect cichlid visual pigments to change
through ontogeny for two reasons. First, cichlids develop
directly without any discrete metamorphosis. The young
are mouth-brooded and pass through three developmental stages: embryonic (up to hatching at day 5); larval
(from hatching to release from the mother's mouth, day
21); and juvenile (from release to sexual maturity at 6
months) [50,51]. Sexual maturity occurs at the same age
in tilapia and the Lake Malawi species. Second, there are
no dramatic changes in habitat, water quality or photic
environment as the fish develop. For most species, juveniles are released and mature in the same general location
where they were spawned. Previous cichlid studies support the developmental stability of the retinal mosaic with
no obvious morphological changes. The square retinal
mosaic of four double cones surrounding a single cone
occurs in O. niloticus [52], the Tanganyikan cichlid Astatotilapia burtoni [53] and the Lake Victoria species Haplochromis argens [54]. The mosaic is formed by day 5 or 6
and remains stable throughout development [53]. However, these studies did not examine opsin gene expression

or opsin proteins to test whether visual pigments varied
developmentally.
In this work, we used real-time or quantitative reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) [5557] to quantify the relative expression of cone opsin genes
through ontogeny. We compared the outgroup cichlid, O.
niloticus, with several species from Lake Malawi. We also
used microspectrophotometry (MSP) to confirm that in
tilapia, the genes detected by qRT-PCR correspond to visual pigments present in the retina. We were able to accurately quantify expression at multiple time points through
ontogeny. This enabled us to map the trajectory of opsin
gene expression during the first months of the life cycle
and to examine the role of heterochrony in visual sensitivity.

Results
Microspectrophotometry
MSP of adult O. niloticus revealed three cone morphotypes: single cones with a pigment λmax at 449 ± 5 nm and
double cones with a pigment λmax at either 542 ± 6 nm or
596 ± 6 nm. Tilapia utilize mixed chromophores consisting of retinal derived from both vitamin A1 (11-cis retinal) and vitamin A2 (3,4-didehydroretinal) [58]. Since
the most long wavelength sensitive A1-based pigments are
575 nm [10], the presence of a 596 nm pigment is consistent with a mixture of A1 and A2 retinal. Double cone
combinations included 542/542 (n = 3), 542/596 (n = 9)
and 596/596 (n = 7). Rods contained visual pigments
with a peak absorbance of 516 ± 2 nm.

MSP of larval and juvenile tilapia revealed a greater diversity of cone types. These included visual pigments from six
distinct spectral classes from the ultraviolet to the LWS
pigments (sample spectra shown in Addition file 1). Most
individuals had retina utilizing A1 chromophores,
although A1/A2 content differed between individuals
resulting in variation in λmax for a given cone type. As A1/
A2 shifts increase with wavelength, shifts were most significant for the LWS pigments. The distribution of cone
λmax did fall into groups, which were centered around the
λmax measured from protein expression of the tilapia cone
opsin genes reconstituted with the A1 chromophore [19].
Additional file 2 shows the distribution of cone λmax as
well as the λmax determined from the A1 reconstituted proteins and the expected shifts between A1 and A2 pigments
[59]. We used the expected A1/A2 sensitivities as well as
the observed groupings to sort the pigments into the following gene classes: SWS1 (<380 nm), SWS2b (410–440
nm), SWS2a (445–465 nm), RH2b (465–495 nm), RH2a
(500–545 nm) and LWS (>550 nm). Based on this sorting, we calculated the average peak λmax ± 1 standard deviation (SD) for each class and found they agreed with those
determined from protein expression and reconstitution
with 11-cis retinal (Table 1) [1,19], allowing for some A1–
A2 shift in the LWS class. We grouped the RH2a α and β
cones into one RH2a class as there was too much overlap
to separate them using MSP.
MSP measurements demonstrated the diversity of cone
types present in the retina. Based on the assignment of
cone λmax to opsin gene, we calculated the relative
amounts of opsin expression for each developmental
stage (Figure 2). These calculations assume that each cone
type expresses only one opsin gene. These relative gene
ratios were compared with those determined by qRT-PCR
for whole retinas (see below). The ratios were in qualitative agreement and support the idea that when a given
gene is transcribed, the corresponding protein is present
in the retina.
Cone opsin expression through tilapia ontogeny
Tilapia opsin expression is turned on by 5 days post-fertilization. This was determined by measuring RH2a and
LWS opsin relative to β-actin expression in whole tilapia
embryos. The LWS opsin to β-actin ratio increased from
0.0004 to 0.013 to 0.39 on days 3, 4 and 5. The average
LWS opsin/β-actin ratio during the first 20 days was 0.88
so that day 5 expression was 44% of the larval level. The
RH2a genes showed similar temporal results. Opsin
expression by day 5 is consistent with observations of
complete cone outer segments by day 5 in A. burtoni [53].

The dynamic changes in cone opsin gene expression
through tilapia development are shown in Figure 3. The
results from two tilapia broods agreed quite well and are

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/22

superimposed. Curves have been fitted to the data to summarize the gene expression trends (equations are provided in Additional file 3). The SWS1 and RH2b genes are
expressed strongly in the larval phase, but are not
expressed in adults. Expression of both genes steadily
decreases until day 60, when they are effectively turned
off. The SWS2b gene is weakly expressed at the earliest
times, peaks in expression around day 60, and then
decreases until it is turned off in adulthood. Expression of
the SWS2a gene does not turn on until day 36, after which
it increases steadily until the adult level is reached. RH2a
genes are expressed throughout ontogeny, but at low levels, while LWS increases in expression until it levels off
after day 60.
Analysis of the ontogenetic expression patterns using
analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that several of the
genes are correlated temporally. SWS1 and RH2b follow
similar time courses and are linearly correlated with each
other (r2 = 0.81). Both genes are inversely correlated with
LWS (SWS1 r2 = 0.79 and RH2b r2 = 0.93) and SWS2a
(SWS1 r2 = 0.59 and RH2b r2 = 0.78) genes. Finally LWS is
positively correlated with SWS2a (r2 = 0.79) and negatively correlated with RH2aα (r2 = 0.60). These close temporal associations suggest there may be genetic coregulation of these genes. This may be the result of the
genomic organization of these genes in tandem arrays
similar to the opsin genes of other fishes [14].
Comparison of tilapia qRT-PCR gene expression and MSP
Gene expression determined by qRT-PCR was compared
with MSP cone count results by averaging gene expression
from several individuals at ages comparable with the individuals examined by MSP (Figure 2). The gene expression
measured by qRT-PCR and inferred from MSP cone
counts agreed qualitatively at each of the four developmental stages. Whenever a given gene is expressed, we
detected the expected cone type using MSP. These developmental comparisons confirmed previous results, which
showed agreement between gene expression and the presence of corresponding cone types in adults (see [60] and
Carleton et al. unpublished). Therefore, qRT-PCR and
MSP provide consistent descriptions of which cones are
present at a given developmental stage.

We also quantitatively compared the MSP and qRT-PCR
results using regression analysis (Additional file 4). In
general, when a given gene's expression increases, more
cones are detected. However, the RH2a gene showed the
opposite trend, suggesting the qRT-PCR and MSP results
were not correlated perfectly. There are several reasons
why these two methods might differ quantitatively. First,
the fish examined by MSP and qRT-PCR came from different broods raised at different times. Second, MSP is not a
comprehensive method and inherently involves sub-sam-

During MSP, cells are identified based on cone morphology (single versus double) providing a link between visual
pigment absorbance and cone morphology. We can therefore draw additional conclusions about the progression of
gene expression in a given cone type. The 360 (SWS1),
425 (SWS2b) and 455 nm (SWS2a) pigments are all
expressed in single cones. Therefore, the qRT-PCR data
suggest that there is an ontogenetic progression in single
cones, from SWS1 to SWS2b to SWS2a. In double cones,
the 480 (RH2b), 525 (RH2a) and 560 nm (LWS) pigments are expressed. Since RH2a expression is relatively
constant, this suggests that expression of the RH2b gene is
replaced by LWS.
In tilapia, cone opsin gene expression reaches the final
adult complement of opsin genes at 225 days, or approximately 6 months (sexual maturity). At this point, the
SWS1, SWS2b, RH2b and RH2aβ genes are turned off and
SWS2a, RH2aα and LWS genes are on. Therefore, the
expression of these genes agrees with the observation of
three visual pigments in adults by MSP.

pling just a few cones from one or two parts of the retina.
Third, MSP convolves gene expression and chromophore
usage. This decreases the accuracy of making one-to-one
assignments of the cone class to the opsin gene expressed.
Fourth, since the photoreceptor outer segments turn over
every 2 or 3 weeks [61-63], MSP measures the protein
which has been produced during the preceding 2 or 3
weeks. Gene expression measures the genes that are being
expressed on a given day. Therefore, the two methods
measured proteins or genes across different time frames.
For all of these reasons, we use MSP only to make qualitative comparisons and to support the idea that expression
of a given gene indicates the presence of the corresponding cone protein at that life stage.

Cone opsin expression through ontogeny of Lake Malawi
cichlids
Ontogenetic plots of opsin gene expression in Lake
Malawi cichlids showed two different patterns, both of
which differ from that seen in tilapia. Species from the
rock-dwelling clade (M. zebra, Metriaclima benetos and
Labeotropheus fuelleborni) show one ontogenetic pattern
(see Figure 4 for data from M. zebra and Additional file 5
for data for M. benetos and L. fuelleborni). For single cone
genes, the SWS1 gene is turned on in larvae and although
it decreases somewhat, it is never turned off. The SWS2b
gene turns on slowly through development and then stays
on. No expression of the SWS2a gene is observed.
Although SWS2a could be expressed under some other
behavioral or reproductive state, it is possible that SWS2a
may now be a pseudogene in these species. We have
found missense mutations in SWS2a showing that it is a
pseudogene in the Tanganyikan cichlid, Neolamprologus
brichardi [64]. In double cones, the RH2b gene is turned
on and, although it decreases, it stays on into the adult
stage, following a pattern similar to SWS1. The RH2a
genes (α and β analyzed together) are highly expressed
while expression of LWS is quite low. These rock-dwelling
species, therefore, mimic the expression patterns of young
tilapia. They follow the gene progression pattern up
through about 40 days post-fertilization (dpf) in tilapia,
but stretch this progression out over their life cycle. The
Malawian rock-dwelling cichlids have altered their developmental pattern, slowing down the progression of opsin
gene expression. Another significant change is that the
RH2a and LWS genes have switched roles. In tilapia, LWS
is highly expressed and RH2a is expressed at a low level.

to have a pattern of gene expression similar to that in
adults.
In order to put the different gene expression patterns on a
biological scale, which can be plotted through development, we converted gene expression into average peak
wavelength of either single or double cones. This was
based on a weighting of the relative expression of each
gene and its peak spectral absorbance, determined from
protein expression (Table 1). For single cones, the SWS1,
SWS2b and SWS2a genes are expressed so that the single
cone λmax is given by

In the Malawian rock dwellers, RH2a is highly expressed

Species from the sand-dwelling clade (D. compressiceps

adults, with significant expression of only SWS2a, RH2a
and LWS. T. intermedius also shows strong similarities
between its larval, juvenile and adult expression patterns,
which center on SWS2a, RH2a and LWS expression.

function of age, to highlight the wavelength shifts that
occur through development. We have simplified the data
presentation in order to summarize all of the species on
one plot and highlight the trends in the data. For those
species where we have a significant number of data points
(tilapia, M. benetos, M. zebra, L. fuelleborni), we fitted the
raw data and plot only the fit curves for clarity (for example, fits from Figures 3 and 4, and Additional file 5; see
Additional file 3 for curve fits). For those species where we
had fewer data points, we included the raw data in the figure.
The data in Figure 6 map out how cone λmax varies
through ontogeny. For tilapia, opsin gene expression (Figure 3) shows that single cones progress from SWS1 (λSWS1
= 360 nm) to SWS2b (λSWS2b = 425 nm) to SWS2a (λSWS2a
= 456 nm). This gives an average λmax for tilapia single
cones (black line in Figure 6a) that starts at 360 nm and
increases through 425 nm at 60 dpf and ends at 456 nm
in adults (300 dpf). For tilapia double cones, gene expression goes from a mixture of RH2b and RH2aα in early
development to RH2aα and LWS in adults. In Figure 6b,
the average λmax starts at the average of these two double
cone pigments (λRH2b = 472 nm and λRH2a = 528 nm) and
ends with double cones with λmax close to that of the LWS
cones (λLWS = 561 nm). Tilapia, therefore, shows an obvious ontogenetic progression from low to high λmax in both
single and double cones.
The tilapia ontogenetic pattern differs significantly from
what we see for the Lake Malawi cichlids. M. zebra, M.
zebra 'gold', M. benetos and L. fuelleborni show λmax values
that start low in larvae and stay low or rise more slowly
than the tilapia progression. Therefore, they retain the
characteristics of tilapia larval/juvenile gene expression
patterns and can be considered neotenic, with decelerated
rates of opsin progression. Both single and double cone
λmax for D. compressiceps and T. intermedius start high early
in development and remains high into the adult stage,
similar to the λmax of tilapia adults. This suggests these
species have direct developing retinas, which express only
adult-like genes resulting in adult-like peak sensitivities.

Discussion
Differential gene expression, utilizing subsets of the opsin
genes, is a powerful mechanism by which the visual system can be tuned through development. In this work, we
used qRT-PCR to document the differential expression of
opsin genes during development in several cichlid species.
This study is one of the first to map out the trajectory of
opsin gene expression and to demonstrate that heterochronic shifts can occur in neural systems.

The tilapia visual system changes through ontogeny
Adult tilapia have a retina based on three spectral classes
of cones (449, 542 and 596 nm). The presence of three
spectral classes of cone is similar to that reported for other
African cichlids [1,2,60,65,66]. These three cone types are
a direct result of the expression of three cone opsin genes
in adults: SWS2a, RH2a and LWS genes [21].

Larval and juvenile tilapia express different subsets of the
opsins and have more complex visual pigment complements. There are periods when four opsin genes are
expressed and a brief period around 45–50 days when six
cone opsins are present. This dynamic progression of
expressed cone opsin genes starts with the short wavelength sensitive genes, SWS1 and RH2b, which are then
replaced with the longer wavelength sensitive juvenile
(SWS2b) and adult (SWS2a, LWS) genes. Ultraviolet/violet sensitivity occurs in many juvenile fishes, as well as
fishes that feed on plankton [37,67,68]. The expression of
the ultraviolet (SWS1) and then violet (SWS2b) sensitive
genes in the early life stages of tilapia may, therefore, be
important for successful foraging.
Another temporal change is that more of the double cones
become long wavelength sensitive as the LWS gene
becomes the dominant opsin expressed in double cones.
The shift toward longer wavelength sensitivity may help
tilapia adapt to the typically murky African riverine environment [69]. Riverine cichlids studied previously use
vitamin A2 chromophores, a factor which may be correlated with more turbid visual environments and selection
for longer wavelength sensitivity [6]. This agrees with our
previous observations of increases in LWS expression and
A2 chromophore use in cichlids from the murky habitats
of Lake Victoria [60].
Quantifying the temporal patterns of opsin gene expression reveals a dynamic visual system, which changes
through tilapia ontogeny. Previous morphological studies
indicate that the cichlid retinal mosaic is not restructured
through development [53,54], although additional studies are needed to confirm this. If this is true, then opsin
expression in individual photoreceptors must change
through time resulting in co-expression of more than one
visual pigment in a given cell for brief periods. Co-expression has been documented in certain rodents [70,71] and
other larval fishes [37,38,72]. In MSP of tilapia, we did
not find evidence for co-expression in single cones. However, MSP of the youngest fish is difficult as the cones are
quite small and we may not have had a high enough signal-to-noise ratio to distinguish between two pigments
with somewhat overlapping spectra. However, we did find
approximately 15 double cones at 30–35 dpf having dual
absorbance peaks at 490 and 560 nm, indicating expression of both RH2b and LWS genes. It was possible to

bleach the 560 and 490 nm pigments separately, confirming the presence of two distinct proteins. We therefore
suggest a model in which the retinal mosaic and its associated neural wiring remains constant, while the complement of cone opsins shifts from shorter to longer opsins
as the fish matures. Future work to localize opsins using in
situ hybridization is needed to confirm retinal spatial patterning and document the succession of opsin genes, in
particular photoreceptor cell types.
Lake Malawi opsin expression exhibits heterochrony
The Lake Malawi species all have the same seven cone
opsin genes possessed by their sister group, tilapia. However, the ancestral progression of gene expression has
been modified as they adapt to their unique ecologies.
Two different developmental patterns were identified
here. Larval Malawi rock dwellers express the short wavelength sensitive genes found in young tilapia fry and
either retain this larval gene set (M. zebra 'gold') or slowly
shift to the tilapia's juvenile gene set (M. zebra, M. benetos,
L. fuelleborni). This neotenic expression pattern enables
these species to retain the short wavelength sensitivities
found in young tilapia. The Malawian sand dwellers, D.
compressiceps and T. intermedius, have a different pattern.
They express the long wavelength sensitive genes, similar
to adult tilapia. However, they do not follow the same
complex ontogenetic progression from shorter to longer
wavelength sensitivities seen in tilapia. Instead, they follow a direct development path and express the long wavelength genes beginning in the larval stages.

These changes in developmental program may be an
adaptation to the constantly clear waters of Lake Malawi,
which is one of the clearest lakes in the world [69]. Fish
that inhabit a constant photic environment throughout
their life can use the optimal pigment set for those conditions, and may no longer need developmental shifts in
visual sensitivity. These developmental changes may also
have been driven by the specialized foraging behaviors of
these species. Most rock-dwelling cichlids are opportunistic zooplanktivores. Retaining the larval ultraviolet/violet
sensitivities into their adult stages may enable them to
feed more efficiently on zooplankton throughout their
lives [67,73]. The sand dwellers studied here are not
known for zooplanktivory and, therefore, may not need
ultraviolet/violet detection capabilities.
Role of heterochrony in sensory systems
This work documents the differing temporal pattern of
opsin gene expression in cichlid fishes. Opsin expression
can be dynamic, with a progression of different opsin gene
combinations from the larval to adult stages. However,
Lake Malawi cichlids have modified the developmental
program of their cichlid tilapia-like ancestor. Some
express the adult gene sets at larval stages while others

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/22

retain the larval genes into adulthood. These heterochronic shifts cause the large differences in adult sensitivities observed between closely related species [1,2,21].
Heterochrony is, therefore, a key mechanism by which
cichlid visual systems are tuned.
These differences have evolved among closely related species which have radiated in Lake Malawi within the last 1
million years. Figure 7 summarizes the cichlid developmental programs within a phylogenetic context including
results from Lake Victoria [60]. The rapid evolution of
these expression patterns suggests that regulation of the
different opsin genes is coordinated by a developmental
program that can be easily modified. Studies of additional
species are needed to determine how labile these heterochronic shifts are. However, it is clear from this work that
evolution can alter early developmental stages to shape
adult visual systems. Heterochronic shifts in gene expression are a powerful way to modify the senses.

Conclusion
Cichlids have diverse visual sensitivities which differ
between species. These sensitivities can vary through
development, with heterochronic shifts in developmental
patterning resulting in alternate adult sensitivities.
Changes in adult visual sensitivities could have important
implications for mate preferences, mate choice and ultimately cichlid speciation. If closely related species differ
in visual sensitivities, females with different visual prefer-

shows a progression from a larval (pink) to a juvenile (violet)
to an adult (blue) gene set. In contrast, cichlids from Lake
Victoria and sand dwellers from Lake Malawi have a direct
developing retina with only the adult gene set expressed
throughout life. Rock dwellers from Lake Malawi have a neotenic progression, retaining the larval gene set or progressing
slowly from larval to juvenile gene sets.

ences might prefer differently colored males as mates.
Work is in progress to determine whether closely related
species differ in visual sensitivities, how these sensitivities
relate to the spectral colors of males, and whether these
differences affect female mate preferences.

Methods
Fish species
Broods of seven different cichlid species were reared in
our tropical aquaculture facility according to approved
animal care protocols. Nile tilapia, O. niloticus, as well as
the Malawian species (D. compressiceps and T. intermedius)
were bred from commercial stocks while the Malawian
species (M. zebra, M. zebra 'gold', M. benetos and L. fuelleborni) were bred from wild caught stocks. Breeding groups
were housed in glass tanks and kept at 24–26°C under 14
hour:10 hour day:night light cycles. Light levels were 100
lux at the top of the rack, although this decreased by up to
50% for fish raised on lower levels. The day of breeding
was determined when the female's buccal cavity expanded
due to a clutch of eggs.
MSP
Adult tilapia were provided by the Northwest Fisheries
Unit of the National Marine Fisheries Service and examined at Friday Harbor. Tilapia at younger developmental
stages were raised in our tropical aquaculture facility. A
total of 15 individuals were sampled from four different
age classes: 20–26 dpf, 28–30 dpf, 40–48 dpf and >4
months in age.

MSP followed previous methods [38]. Fish were dark
adapted for at least 2 hours and anesthetized with MS222. Retinas were dissected under dim red light, placed in
buffered saline, teased apart and placed between two
quartz coverslips. Spectral absorbance curves from rod
and cone cells were obtained using a single-beam microspectrophotometer fitted with quartz optics. Photoreceptor absorbance was measured by scanning in both
directions from 750 to 350 nm and comparing with a
baseline scan. Pigments were confirmed by their photolability and outer segment dichroism [74]. The λmax was estimated by fitting them to a visual pigment template [75].
For each class of photoreceptor cells, the average λmax ± 1
SD was reported. Photoreceptor cell types were identified
by their morphological appearance on the microscope
stage.
qRT-PCR
For tilapia, a preliminary developmental series examined
whole embryos from day 2 up to day 25 to look at the
onset of RH2 and LWS opsin expression using β-actin for
normalization. Full developmental series were then examined for all opsins for two separate tilapia broods (approximately 60 individuals each). Developmental series for M.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/22

zebra, M. benetos and L. fuelleborni were examined from
single broods (approximately 30 individuals). Finally, a
few developmental time points were sampled for D. compressiceps, M. zebra 'gold' and T. intermedius. Either whole
eyes (fish <60 days) or retinas (>60 days) were examined
for one to three individuals at each time point in the
mbuna (rock dwellers) and one to seven individuals in
tilapia. As cichlid opsin expression has been shown to
have a circadian rhythm [76,77], all fish were sampled at
the same time of day, between 10 and 11 a.m. Fish were
euthanized with MS-222, decapitated and eyes or retinas
removed.
The qRT-PCR methods were similar to our previous studies [19]. Total RNA was extracted with Trizol (Invitrogen)
and quantified from the ratio of absorption at 260 and
280 nm. One microgram of total RNA was reverse transcribed using a poly T primer and Superscript III (Invitrogen) at 42°C to create a cDNA mixture. Parallel qRT-PCR
reactions were then set up using gene-specific Taqman
primers and probes [19,21]. The probes were located on
an exon-exon junction and no amplification was obtained
in the controls without reverse transcriptase enzyme. For
the Malawian species, the genetically similar RH2aα and
RH2aβ were analyzed together using primers that amplified both genes, so that qRT-PCR utilized six primer-probe
sets (SWS1, SWS2b, SWS2a, RH2b, RH2a and LWS). The
same procedure was used for tilapia, except that additional qRT-PCR reactions were performed using forward
primers, which distinguished between the RH2aα and β
genes [19]. For the earliest developmental series, β-actin
was used as a normalization gene with the following
primers and probe: forward CCCTGAGGCCCTCTTCCA;
reverse GATGCTGTTGTAGGTGGTTTCG; probe 6-FAMCCTTCCTTGGTATGGAATCCTGCGGA-Tamra. Real-time
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fluorescence was monitored during 40 cycles of PCR on a GeneAmp 5700
sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, 95°C for
15 seconds, 55°C for 30 seconds, 65°C for 60 seconds).
Critical cycle numbers were determined and used to calculate relative gene expression as a fraction of the total cone
opsin gene expression as in previous work [19]. Data were
collected for two or three replicates at each developmental
time point for each developmental series.

Distribution of λmax measured in the tilapia developmental series. The
number of cones in each 5 nm bin is indicated. The λmax for the A1 reconstituted pigments [19] are marked along the top of the figure as well as
the predicted λmax of the corresponding A2 pigments calculated using the
A1/A2 shifts of Harosi [59]. The boundaries defined by the A1 and A2
pigment λmax are shown by the arrows. This suggests that the shorter wavelength pigments are reasonably well resolved, but there are overlaps for the
RH2a (α and β) and LWS pigments. The assignment of these groups to
expression of a particular opsin gene is shown by color coding, with the
name of the particular opsin gene similarly colored. We further combine
the RH2aα and β cone pigments into RH2a for analysis of opsin gene
expression.

The equations used to fit the ontogenetic data for four of the cichlid species
examined where we had measured at least 10 time points. In these equations, y is the amount of gene expressed and t is the developmental age in
days. For tilapia, RH2aα and RH2aβ are measured separately, but for all
of the Malawian species, the sum of these two genes is combined as RH2a.
It is difficult to calculate R2 for exponential curves. However, to indicate
the quality of the data we calculate R2 for the logarithm of the exponential
curves (which are linear). Some data involve a rising and then falling part
to the curve. R2 is labeled by which part of the curve is used. For some of
the genes, there is very little expression (for example, SWS2a and LWS in
mbuna) or expression is fairly constant over all life stages (RH2a). For
these genes, the R2 values are very low as there is no correlation with age.
