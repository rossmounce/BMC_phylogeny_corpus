Abstract
Background: Astacins are a large family of zinc metalloproteases found in bacteria and animals. They have diverse
roles ranging from digestion of food to processing of extracellular matrix components. The C. elegans genome
contains an unusually large number of astacins, of which the majority have not been functionally characterized yet.
Results: We analyzed the expression pattern of previously uncharacterized members of the astacin family to try
and obtain clues to potential functions. Prominent sites of expression for many members of this family are the
hypodermis, the alimentary system and several specialized cells including sensory sheath and sockets cells, which
are located at openings in the body wall. We isolated mutants affecting representative members of the various
subfamilies. Mutants in nas-5, nas-21 and nas-39 (the BMP-1/Tolloid homologue) are viable and have no apparent
phenotypic defects. Mutants in nas-6 and nas-6; nas-7 double mutants are slow growing and have defects in the
grinder of the pharynx, a cuticular structure important for food processing.
Conclusions: Expression data and phenotypic characterization of selected family members suggest a diversity of
functions for members of the astacin family in nematodes. In part this might be due to extracellular structures
unique to nematodes.

Background
Astacins are a family of zinc metalloproteases. There are
several hundred astacins identified in a variety of different
species ranging from bacteria to humans (see [1,2] for
review). The first member of this family, a digestive
enzyme, was identified in the crayfish Astacus astacus [3].
A second member of the family, bone morphogenetic protein 1 (BMP-1), was found in vertebrates as a bone-inducing factor [4,5], illustrating the range of physiological
functions associated with these proteases. BMP-1 and its
Drosophila homologues, Tolloid and Tolloid-like are
among the best characterized members of the family (see
[6] for a recent review). BMP-1/Tolloid is conserved in
evolution and found even in cnidarians [7]. In vertebrates
it is involved in processing components of the extracellular
matrix, most notably fibrillar collagens, where it acts as
procollagen C-protease [8]. Additional substrates are
TGF-b inhibitors like chordin/SOG. Cleavage of chordin
by BMP-1 in the embryo leads to activation of the TGF-b

signaling pathway. This has been studied extensively in
Drosophila, where activation of the TGF-b decapentaplegic
(dpp) on the dorsal side is a key event in patterning the
dorso-ventral axis [9]. In vertebrates BMP-1 plays an additional role in the activation of two particular members of
the TGF-b family. It directly cleaves the prodomain of
myostatin and GDF11, leading to activation of these
growth factors [10,11].
A subgroup within the astacin family are meprins, which
are confined to vertebrates and found in the small intestine, kidney and skin, where they are thought to cleave
biologically active peptides, cytokines and components of
the extracellular matrix [12]. The discovery of the close
relationship between meprin and the crayfish astacin led
to the proposal to name this group of zinc metalloproteases “the astacin family” [13]. The remaining astacins
form a rather diverse group including digestive enzymes,
hatching enzymes and also the majority of the astacins
found in C. elegans [3,14]. C. elegans astacins have been
clustered into six subgroups based on their domain organization [14], specifically on domains found in the C-terminal extensions adjacent to the catalytic site. Members of

subgroup I (nas-1 to nas-5) have no additional domains
and subgroup II (nas-6 to nas-15) is characterized by the
presence of SXC/ShK toxin domains. Members of subgroup III (nas-16 to nas-30) typically have a single EGF
domain and a single CUB domain. Subgroup IV (nas-31
and nas-32) has a single SXC/ShK toxin domain in addition to the EGF and CUB domains, whereas members of
subgroup V (nas-33 to nas-38) have a TSP1 domain
instead. Subgroup VI (nas-39) consists of the single BMP1/Tolloid homologue in C. elegans.
Only a few C. elegans astacins have been functionally
characterized so far. hch-1/nas-34 is required for digestion of the outer eggshell and migration of a neuroblast
[15,16]. nas-36 and nas-37 are required for molting
[17,18]. They are expressed and probably secreted from
the hypodermis and are thought to digest components
of the cuticle to allow it to be shed. dpy-31/nas-35
mutants are embryonic lethal and have characteristic
cuticle synthesis defects [19]. DPY-31 is the only C. elegans astacin with a likely substrate identified. DPY-31 is
thought to be responsible for C-terminal cleavage of the
cuticular collagen SQT-3 [19], a function reminiscent of
the role of BMP-1 in cleaving fibrillar collagens in vertebrates [8]. DPY-31 from two parasitic nematodes,
H. contortus and B. malayi, has been shown recently to
have an evolutionary conserved function and a similar
range of protease activity [20].
To begin a characterization of the remaining members
of this family we first determined the expression pattern of
previously uncharacterized genes. We then tried to isolate
mutations in selected members of the different subfamilies
and were able to obtain mutations in nas-5,6,7,21 and 39,
representing all but one of the previously uncharacterized
subgroups. Mutant animals are viable in all cases indicating that none of these genes is essential for survival. nas-6
and nas-7 mutants show an incompletely penetrant slow
growth and partial larval arrest phenotype. A more
detailed examination of these animals revealed structural
defects in the pharynx, suggesting a role for these genes in
pharyngeal development. We were not able to detect any
obvious defects in mutants in nas-39 mutants, the only
C. elegans BMP-1/Tolloid homologue. The lack of phenotypes related to collagen processing or TGF-b signaling,
characteristic phenotypes of its homologues in Drosophila
and vertebrates, suggests that this gene, while structurally
conserved, has functionally evolved independently in
nematodes.

Results
Nematode astacin phylogeny

The C. elegans genome contains 40 astacin genes. In a
phylogenetic tree based on alignments of the protease
domain subgroups I and II cluster together and also subgroups III-V (Figure 1). A comparison with sequences of

Page 2 of 13

other nematodes like C. remanei, C. briggsae and
B. malayi shows that the astacin family has undergone significant evolution within the nematodes. The phylogenetic
analysis points to a complex evolutionary history within
the genus Caenorhabditis with multiple gene losses and
duplications (Figure 1). The genome of B. malayi, a
human parasite not closely related to C. elegans, contains
only 13 astacins. These represent five of the six subgroups.
Not found in B. malayi are a large number of members of
subgroup III as well as nas-39/BMP1/Tolloid. Recently the
genome sequences of several other nematodes have
become available [21-23]. A preliminary analysis reveals
the presence of about 53 astacins in Pristionchus pacificus,
about 30 in Meloidogyne hapla and about 37 in Meloidogyne incognita. This would support the idea of a more general expansion of this protein family within nematodes.
The recently sequenced genomes of the flatworms Schistsoma mansoni [24] and Schistosoma japonicum [25]
(phylum: Platyhelminthes) each contain only two astacins,
orthologs of nas-4 and nas-39 (Additional file 1, Table S1).
Astacins are expressed predominantly in tissues exposed
to the outside environment

We used two independent approaches to identify sites of
expression for previously uncharacterized members of
the astacin family: ‘green fluorescent protein’ (GFP)
reporter constructs (Figure 2; Tables 1, 2) and serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) of different developmental stages and embryonic tissues (Tables 3, 4). GFP
reporter constructs were generated by fusing putative
promoter regions with a cDNA encoding GFP. Transgenic animals were assayed for GFP expression. GFP
reporters for eight of the genes gave no detectable
expression (see Table 2). Some of the remaining astacins
showed expression in multiple tissues, but the majority of
the genes were expressed in only a few cells or cell types
(Table 1). Prominent sites of expression at the tissue and
organ level are the digestive system (pharynx and intestine) and the hypodermis, which express a large number
of astacins (Table 2). Notably underrepresented are
‘internal tissues’ like body wall muscle, the nervous system and reproductive organs (gonad, uterus). These tissues only express a few astacins. Expression within the
pharynx is essentially confined to two cell types, muscle
cells and marginal cells. Marginal cells lie between pharyngeal muscle cells and form an integral part of the pharyngeal myoepithelium. They are thought to provide
continuity and strength to the epithelium. Several astacins are expressed in various interfacial cells, many of
which are responsible for generating openings in the
body wall. Examples are the rectal and vulval epithelium,
sensory sheath and socket cells, the excretory duct cell
and the uterine-seam attachment (Table 2). Five astacins
are expressed in gland cells of the alimentary tract, nas-5
and nas-12 in pharyngeal glands and nas-2, nas-19 and

nas-25 in rectal glands, suggesting a putative role as
digestive enzymes.
Previously characterized astacins of subgroup V (hch-1/
nas-34, dpy-31/nas-35, nas-36,37,) are all expressed in the
hypodermis [16-19] and probably process cuticle components like cuticular collagens. We found eight more astacins expressed in hypodermis (Table 2). Four of those
belong to subgroup II and four belong to subgroup IV,
suggesting that certain members of these subgroups might
also be involved in processing cuticle components.
16 astacins across almost all subgroups are expressed in
the intestine, suggesting a possible role as food digestive

enzymes. With the exception of nas-16, all of these genes
are expressed outside the alimentary tract as well. Among
these are the characterized astacins dpy-31/nas-35 and
nas-37, for which no role in food digestion has yet been
proposed [17-19]. Members of subgroup I have no
domains in addition to the metalloprotease domain. They
might have broad substrate specificity, a characteristic feature of food digestive enzymes. While two members of
this subgroup are expressed in gland cells of the alimentary system (nas-2 and nas-5), or the gut (nas-2 and nas3), there is also specific expression of some members in
specialized cells like anterior hypodermal cells, arcade cells

In an independent approach expression data for astacins
was extracted from a number of SAGE experiments where
different larval stages and individual embryonic tissues
were sampled for general gene expression (Tables 3, 4).
Overall only a minority of the astacins is represented in

many/most
neurons

these libraries (14 out of 40). The sequencing depth of
these SAGE libraries is such that genes expressed at low
levels or in only a few cells are not necessarily represented
in the libraries. Nevertheless we did find representation
for three genes that did not give noticeable expression
with GFP reporters. nas-8 was found in the L1 stage
library, nas-38 in the L2 library and nas-29 in the embryo

and several larval stages. In all cases absolute expression
levels were very low with one to four tags per library.
A comparison of expression levels across developmental
stages revealed stage-specific changes for three astacins.
hch-1/nas-34 is strongly expressed in ooctyes and
embryos, as expected from its function as hatching
enzyme [16]. nas-9 and nas-11 are both predominantly
expressed in the third larval stage. Both genes are
expressed in the hypodermis and could play a role in
stage-specific processing of cuticle components.
Very few astacins are represented in SAGE libraries
from various embryonic tissues. hch-1/nas-34 is enriched
in embryonic hypodermal cells, again as expected from its
proposed function. The other astacins found in these
libraries show no strong tissue enrichment and are

generally found in those tissues that show GFP expression
in the corresponding reporter strain - with the exception
of a low level expression of nas-6, 7 and nas-11 in neurons, which was not seen with the GFP reporter expression constructs.
Functional analysis of astacin genes
nas-5,6 and 7

In order to study possible functions of astacins more
directly we attempted to isolate deletion alleles for several members of the family across the various subgroups. We were able to isolate deletions in nas-5,6,7,21
and nas-39, members of all but one of the previously
uncharacterized subgroups. All mutant strains were
viable and only one had obvious defects. nas-6(hd108)
mutant animals displayed a slow growth phenotype,

enrichment with respect to an embryonic library; only genes represented in embryonic library (contains all genes with tags in any of these libraries)

with a significant fraction of the animals not reaching
the L4 stage at normal speed (Table 5). About 10% of
the animals arrested development at various larval stages
and never reached the adult stage. Upon closer examination we detected defects in the pharynx of those more
slowly growing or arrested animals. Minor morphological abnormalities were apparent in the terminal bulb of
the pharynx (Figure 3B). More significantly, the grinder,
a cuticular tooth-like specialization in the lumen of the
terminal bulb, looked highly abnormal in slow-growing
animals (Figure 3C). The role of the grinder is to grind
up food (bacteria) before it is passed to the intestine.
The abnormalities in the grinder probably do not allow
an efficient processing of the food, which would explain
the slow growth or even arrest. Consistent with this idea
we find reduced pharyngeal pumping rates in slow
growing animals (Table 6). The degree of visible
abnormality in the grinder correlates with the slow
growth or arrest phenotype (stronger grinder defects
correlating with stronger growth defects). Grinder

defects are apparent in embryos suggesting that the
defect is developmental in origin.
Since the slow growth phenotype in nas-6 mutants is
incompletely penetrant and since nas-5 and nas-7 are
expressed in the pharynx as well, we investigated
whether double or triple mutant combinations enhance
the phenotype. We found that nas-6(hd108); nas-7
(hd116) double mutants had a significantly increased
number of slow growing animals, suggesting that nas-7
(hd116) despite having no phenotype on its own, has
some role in grinder development as well. The phenotype of individual slow-growing animals does not change
in nas-6(hd108); nas-7(hd116) double mutants judging
from their morphology and their pharyngeal pumping
rate. nas-5(hd96) does not seem to be involved in this
process, since nas-5(hd96); nas-6(hd108) double mutants
are not different from nas-6(hd108) single mutants and
since nas-5(hd96); nas-6(hd108); nas-7(hd116) triple
mutant animals are not different from nas-6(hd108);
nas-7(hd116) double mutants (Tables 5, 6).

nas-21 and nas-39

nas-21 is a member of subgroup III and is expressed in
the major hypodermis and the uterine-seam attachment
cell (Table 1). Because of this expression pattern potential phenotypes to consider would be defects in the cuticle or in the attachment of the uterus to the vulva.
None of these defects or any other obvious morphological abnormalities were found in nas-21(hd119) mutant
animals, leaving the cellular function of this gene
unclear at this point. It is worth noting that nas-22 is
structurally very similar and has an overlapping expression in both hypodermis and uterine-seam attachment.
It is conceivable that there is functional redundancy
between those two genes.
nas-39 is the only homolog of BMP-1/Tolloid in
C. elegans. It shares the unique domain composition of
five CUB domains and 2 EGF modules following the
metalloprotease domain. Drosophila and vertebrates
homologs play prominent roles in embryonic development most notably in TGF-b signaling and processing
of ECM components. Mutants for Bmp1 in mouse or
Tolloid in Drosophila are lethal. In contrast, nas-39
(hd104) mutant animals are viable and show no obvious
developmental defects. The zinc coordination site in the
catalytic centre of the metalloprotease domain is deleted
in nas-39(hd104), so that this mutation should result in

n = 30; animals not reaching L4 stage after 48 hours were scored

a non-functional protease and hence represent a null
allele. A second allele nas-39(gk343) eliminates the first
exon and is also expected to be a null allele. nas-39
(gk343) mutant animals also display no obvious defects.
TGF-b signaling in C. elegans is involved in several
developmental processes and mutants in the various
TGF-b genes have characteristic defects such as constitutive dauer formation [26], a reduced body length [27]
or uncoordinated movement due to axon navigation
defects [28]. Neither of the nas-39 alleles shows any of
these defects, suggesting that TGF-b signaling is not
affected in nas-39 mutants. The overall structure of the
nervous system was examined in more detail with a
pan-neuronal marker in nas-39(hd104) mutant animals.
We were not able to detect significant defects in the
arrangement of neuronal cell bodies or obvious axon
guidance defects, suggesting that these animals do not
have major neuronal defects. The function of this strikingly conserved gene in C. elegans currently is unclear.

Discussion
Nematode astacin phylogeny

The astacin family of metalloproteases with 40 members
present in C. elegans has expanded in nematodes more
than in any other phylogenetic group [14]. Orthologs for
many of these genes are present in other members of
the genus Caenorhabditis, like C. remanei or C. briggsae,
suggesting that the major expansion of this family did
not occur very recently, i.e. not within the C. elegans
lineage itself. This can be contrasted to the current
annotation of the parasitic nematode B. malayi which
contains only 13 astacin genes. This suggests that either
there was a dramatic expansion of astacins within the
lineage leading to the genus Caenorhabditis or that
B. malayi has lost members of this family. Gene loss
within nematodes seems to be a frequent phenomenon
[29] and the overall number of genes in the B. malayi
genome is estimated to be significantly smaller than in

Park et al. BMC Developmental Biology 2010, 10:14
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/10/14

C. elegans or C. briggsae [30,31], which supports the
second hypothesis. A large number of astacins in other
nematodes like Pristionchus pacificus, Meloidogyne
hapla and Meloidogyne incognita and a small number in
members of other phyla like Schistosoma mansoni also
point to a more general expansion of the astacin family
within nematodes. Details of the evolutionary history
currently remain unclear because of the limited number
of complete nematode genomes currently available.
Astacin expression and function in nematodes

Only four of the astacins in C. elegans have so far been
functionally characterized. They are required for either
digesting egg-shell [15,16], shedding old cuticle during
molting [17,18] or processing a cuticle component [19].
All four genes belong to subgroup V and are expressed
in the hypodermis, the tissue responsible for cuticle
synthesis and turnover. Site of expression and structural
features defining the subgroups apparently are good predictors of potential functions for these genes.
With this idea in mind we started to characterize the
expression of the remaining astacins. Expression was
mainly analyzed by using reporter constructs under the
control of the putative promoter regions of the gene.
While this strategy greatly simplifies expression analysis
and allows high-throughput studies [32], one has to
keep in mind that reporter constructs do not always
faithfully recapitulate the expression of the native gene.
In cases where there is a discrepancy between reporter
gene expression and other expression data (e.g. SAGE
data) it is probably wise to consider that the reporter
gene expression may be problematic. Similarly our
observation that some reporter constructs did not result
in any visible GFP expression most likely points to lack
of essential control elements in the reporter construct
rather than a genuine lack of expression of the corresponding gene. Keeping these limitations in mind, the
observed gene expression patterns allow us to assess
tentative sites of action and provide suggestions for
potential functions.
Putative cuticle-components processing enzymes

The comparison of expression pattern within subgroups
does not confirm a simple functional subdivision of
these genes along the structurally defined subgroups.
Expression in the major hypodermal cells - typical of
the characterized members of subgroup V mentioned
above - is found in ten astacins belonging to subgroups
II, III and V. In a previous study one of the uncharacterized members of subgroup V (nas-38) was found to be
expressed in hypodermal cells as well [32]. Two of the
genes with hypodermal expression, nas-9 and nas-11,
are upregulated in the L3 stage according to the SAGE
data and could therefore be involved in stage-specific
processing of cuticle components. The other hypodermal astacins do not show any stage-specific expression

Page 9 of 13

and might function in several or even all stages. nas-9
was found in one RNAi experiment to cause a low
penetrance of embryonic lethality [33] and in a different
experiment RNAi against nas-11 resulted in retarded
growth [34]. The relevance of these results with respect
to the function of these genes currently is unclear.
Putative digestive enzymes

The digestive tract consisting of pharynx and intestine is
another major hub of astacin expression. As with hypodermal expression there is little correlation between
subgroups and expression and we find members of
almost all subgroups expressed here. Some of these astacins might be food digestive enzymes. Known digestive
enzymes among astacins typically have no additional
domains besides the protease domain [3]. C. elegans
astacins of this type fall into category I (nas-1,2,3,4,5).
nas-2 and nas-3 are expressed in the intestine and nas-5
is expressed in pharyngeal glands, promoting those
three astacins as the most promising digestive enzyme
candidates. Three additional astacins (nas-12,19,25) are
also expressed in either pharyngeal or rectal glands and
might also function in digestion.
Putative basement membrane processing enzymes

A surprisingly large number of astacins are expressed in
the marginal cells of the pharynx. These cells are sandwiched between the pharyngeal muscle cells and provide
continuity across the musculature of the pharynx. These
cells face the lumen of the pharynx on one side and the
basement membrane surrounding the pharynx on the
opposite side. It is unclear whether astacins produced by
these cells are secreted towards the luminal side or
towards the basement membrane. Currently there is no
evidence that marginal cells produce digestive enzymes,
so it seems more likely that marginal cell astacins are
secreted towards the basement membrane and involved
in processing basement membrane components of the
pharynx.
Muscle cells in C. elegans produce major basement
membrane components including collagen and laminins,
which are known substrates of astacins in other animals.
Ten astacins are expressed in pharyngeal muscle cells
and three are expressed in body wall muscle. These
astacins potentially cleave components of the basement
membrane.
Astacins in interfacial cells

Internal organs like the nervous system, body wall muscle cells and the reproductive system express only a
small number of astacins. In contrast, a large number of
astacins are expressed in a variety of interfacial cells, in
particular cells associated with openings in the body
wall, like rectal epithelial cells, sensory sheath and
socket cells or the arcade cells of the pharynx. It is conceivable that astacins expressed in these cells have an
active role in generating openings in the body wall

Park et al. BMC Developmental Biology 2010, 10:14
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/10/14

through local breakdown of components of the cuticle
and/or basement membrane.
nas-6 and nas-7 in pharynx development

Mutations in nas-6 lead to characteristic defects in pharynx development, most notably abnormalities in the grinder, a cuticular structure required for food processing.
The simplest explanation for the defects is to assume a
role for nas-6 in the processing of cuticular grinder components. nas-6 is expressed in pharyngeal muscle and
marginal cells, which are close to the grinder, supporting
this idea. Neither the molecular composition of the grinder nor its development is known in any detail. The nature of putative substrates for NAS-6 therefore is
currently unclear. nas-7 seems to be required for this
process as well, since nas-6; nas-7 double mutants show
significantly more defects compared to single mutants.
Grinder formation might be controlled redundantly by
other astacins as well, since even nas-6; nas-7 double
mutants only showed partially penetrant defects. A lack
of mutants in most of the pharyngeal astacins currently
prevents us from exploring this idea further.
Redundancy in function

Almost all astacins have been tested in several genomewide RNAi screens. In addition to those astacins discussed above, only nas-5, nas-7, nas-18 and nas-38 have
been identified with phenotypes in RNAi screens: nas-5
in a screen for axon navigation defects [35], nas-7 as
having a reduced brood size or being embryonic lethal
depending on the genotypic context [36], nas-18 as regulating fat content [37] and nas-38 as being involved in
controlling life span [38]. These results point to a variety
of different physiological roles for these secreted proteases. It should be noted that the axon guidance defects
seen in the earlier RNAi screen with nas-5 could not be
confirmed in the nas-5 mutants and that the slow growth
and pharyngeal defects observed in nas-6 mutants here
have not been reported in any of the published RNAi
experiments. The overwhelming majority of astacins
have not produced noticeable phenotypes in a number of
genome-wide RNAi screens [33,34,39]. This might be
simply due to the limited number of phenotypes scored
in these screens, but it could also be a sign of functional
redundancy within the family. In our study we found
enhanced defects in nas-6; nas-7 double mutants compared to nas-6 single mutants, but no defects in nas-7
mutants alone. This kind of functional overlap with closely related family members might be a common phenomenon within the astacins in C. elegans. In particular,
the lack of observable phenotypes in nas-21 mutants in
particular at the uterine-seam junction might be due to
functional overlap with nas-22 and/or nas-5, both of
which are also expressed in the uterine-seam attachment
cell. Further exploration of potential redundant function
of astacins would require the isolation of mutants in the

Page 10 of 13

remaining family members, since RNAi experiments do
not always recapitulate the phenotypes expected from
the mutants. Furthermore, targeting more than one gene
simultaneously in RNAi experiments leads to a significant drop in the effectiveness of RNAi, which makes it
difficult to address functional redundancies with RNAi
alone [40].
One evolutionarily conserved member of the astacin
family in C. elegans is a unique member with no close
relative. NAS-39 is the BMP-1/Tolloid homologue,
which in Drosophila and vertebrates has important roles
in TGF-b signaling and basement membrane collagen
processing [6]. Developmental processes in C. elegans
that are known to depend on TGF-b signaling like axon
guidance [28] or regulation of dauer formation [26] and
body length [27] are unaffected in nas-39 mutants, suggesting that nas-39 is not required to activate TGF-b
signals. In Drosophila and vertebrates nas-39 homologues activate TGF-b signals by cleaving chordin/SOG,
an inhibitor keeping the TGF-b in inactive form. Since
there is no obvious chordin homologue in the C. elegans
genome, the lack of TGF-b related phenotypes is maybe
not entirely surprising. Similarly, fibrillar collagens and
lysyl oxidases, which are major substrates for BMP-1 in
vertebrates are also absent in C. elegans. The strong
conservation of the unique domain composition of the
BMP-1/Tolloid homologue is particularly striking and
somewhat puzzling in this context. There are several
possible evolutionary scenarios to explain this: firstly,
some identified substrates in vertebrates including basement membrane components laminin and perlecan are
present in C. elegans and could be NAS-39 substrates.
Secondly, it is possible that the original substrate for the
BMP-1/Tolloid protease is still present in C. elegans and
hasn’t been identified (neither here nor in other animals). Thirdly, NAS-39 might have acquired additional
nematode-specific substrates before the original substrate had been lost from its genome. A good candidate
for the evolutionary oldest substrate in this case is chordin, since it is found even in Cnidarians [41,42]).

Conclusions
Expression data and phenotypic characterization of
selected family members suggest a diversity of functions
for members of the astacin family in nematodes. The
large expansion of the astacin family in nematodes and
the documented functions of those members where
mutants are available suggest that the majority of these
proteins has evolved within the nematode clade to process components of the extracellular matrix and cuticle.
The size of the family and potential redundancy among
closely related family members complicates the functional analysis of astacins, most of which still remain
functionally uncharacterized.

Methods
Phylogenetic analysis

The C. elegans genome contains 40 Astacin genes
(NAS-1-40, Möhrlen et al. 2003). NAS-40 was previously annotated as pseudogene but the current gene
model (F54B8.15 in Wormbase release WS 198) predicts
a complete protein coding sequence and has therefore
been included in the phylogenetic analysis. The C. elegans genome contains a large duplication on chromosome V, which contains a duplicate of nas-2. This gene
is called Y19D10A.6 and is identical to nas-2 at the
DNA and protein level. Consequently it has not been
included in this analysis. To identify orthologs in the
completely sequenced Nematode genomes of C. briggsae, C. remanei, Brugia malayi and Pristionchus pacificus we used representative C. elegans and vertebrate
astacins, or their conserved domains, as queries for
BLAST searches of WormBase (WS198 for C. briggsae
and C. remanei, WS207 for B. malayi and P. pacificus)
and NCBI (Entrez Gene 10-30-2009 for the Schistosoma
and Melodoigyne genomes).
For phylogenetic studies the active protease domains
from all nematode astacins were aligned using CLUSTAL and imported into GeneDoc for further manipulation. The alignment is available form the authors upon
request. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses were performed
by MrBayes 3.0beta4 [43] with the WAG matrix [44],
assuming a gamma distribution of substitution rates.
Prior probabilities for all trees and amino acid replacement models were equal, the starting trees were random. Metropolis-coupled Markov chain Monte Carlo
sampling was performed with one cold and three heated
chains that were run for 80,000 generations. Trees were
sampled every 10th generation. Posterior probabilities
were estimated on 3,000 trees (burnin = 5,000). The
tree presented here was visualised using TreeView.
Generation of transgenic strains for expression analysis

Putative promoter regions of astacins were amplified by
PCR following the strategy described in [32]. 5’-upstream
regions extending either to the next gene or to a maximum of 3 kb were used. Primers used and regions amplified are described in Additional file 1, Table S2.
Promoter::GFP fusions were generated by PCR-stitching
[45]. Transgenic animals were generated as described
[32].
Analysis of GFP expression patterns

Mixed stage transgenic animals were examined for GFP
expression using a Zeiss Axioplan II microscope. Stacks
of confocal images with 0.2 to 0.5 μm distance between
focal planes were recorded with a Quorum WaveFX
spinning disc system. Image acquisition and analysis was
done with the Volocity software package (Improvision).
Cells were identified by location and cell morphology in

Page 11 of 13

comparison with reference images from Wormatlas
http://www.wormatlas.org/. Maximum intensity projections of all focal planes were used to generate images
for the figures.
SAGE analysis

SAGE libraries were prepared and processed as
described elsewhere [46]. SAGE tags were mapped to
the latest stable release of Wormbase (WS190). Only
tags that could be unambiguously mapped to a single
gene were used. All tags mapping to the same gene
were added up. Tags were normalized with respect to
library size and enrichment was calculated as ratio of
normalized tags in a particular library and tags in the
reference library. Reference libraries used were a mixed
stage library for the stage-specific libraries and a whole
embryo library for the embryonic tissue libraries.
Generation of mutants

Deletion alleles were isolated from a library of EMSmutagenized animals using a poison primer approach to
identify small deletions in certain region of the gene
[47]. PCR primer sets were designed using AcePrimer
[48]. Details about primers and deletions are given in
Additional file 1, Table S3.
Phenotypic characterization of mutants

Ten young adult hermaphrodites were placed on an
NGM plate with E. coli OP50. After one hour, adult
worms were removed and the eggs were incubated at
20°C. 24 hours after the eggs were laid, the numbers of
hatched animals and the numbers of embryos that did
not hatch was counted. 48 hours after the eggs were
laid the numbers of total animals on the plate and the
numbers of animals reaching L4 stage were counted.
Pharyngeal pumping was scored under stereomicroscope
for 1 minute in 30 worms, which did not reach L4 stage.

alleles. Table S1: Orthologs of C. elegans astacins. Table S2: Primers used
