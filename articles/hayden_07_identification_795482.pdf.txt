Abstract
Background: Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) can mediate translational control over the
largest, or major ORF (mORF) in response to starvation, polyamine concentrations, and sucrose
concentrations. One plant uORF with conserved peptide sequences has been shown to exert this
control in an amino acid sequence-dependent manner but generally it is not clear what kinds of
genes are regulated, or how extensively this mechanism is invoked in a given genome.
Results: By comparing full-length cDNA sequences from Arabidopsis and rice we identified 26
distinct homology groups of conserved peptide uORFs, only three of which have been reported
previously. Pairwise Ka/Ks analysis showed that purifying selection had acted on nearly all conserved
peptide uORFs and their associated mORFs. Functions of predicted mORF proteins could be
inferred for 16 homology groups and many of these proteins appear to have a regulatory function,
including 6 transcription factors, 5 signal transduction factors, 3 developmental signal molecules, a
homolog of translation initiation factor eIF5, and a RING finger protein. Transcription factors are
clearly overrepresented in this data set when compared to the frequency calculated for the entire
genome (p = 1.2 × 10-7). Duplicate gene pairs arising from a whole genome duplication (ohnologs)
with a conserved uORF are much more likely to have been retained in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis
thaliana) than are ohnologs of other genes (39% vs 14% of ancestral genes, p = 5 × 10-3). Two uORF
groups were found in animals, indicating an ancient origin of these putative regulatory elements.
Conclusion: Conservation of uORF amino acid sequence, association with homologous mORFs
over long evolutionary time periods, preferential retention after whole genome duplications, and
preferential association with mORFs coding for transcription factors suggest that the conserved
peptide uORFs identified in this study are strong candidates for translational controllers of
regulatory genes.

Background
Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) are small open
reading frames found in the 5' UTR of a mature mRNA,

and can mediate translational regulation of the largest, or
major, ORF (mORF). Regulation by uORFs has been studied in several individual transcripts demonstrating the

importance of uORFs in such processes as polyamine production [1], amino acid production [2,3], and sucrose
response [4], but the biological effect of uORFs in the
vaste majority of transcripts of the genome is still unclear.
Upstream start codons (uAUGs) occur in 20–30% of
yeast, mammalian, and plant transcript 5' UTRs [5-7]
therefore potentially thousands of genes are regulated in
this manner.
The majority of characterized uORFs appear to act in an
amino acid sequence-independent manner, regulating
mORF translation by the uORF start codon nucleotide
context, by the uORF length, or by the distance between
the uORF stop codon and the mORF start codon, rather
than by uORF-encoded peptides [8-11]. Some uORFs,
however, do rely on peptide sequences to mediate translational regulation of the associated mORF, but few examples have been identified and characterized to date. In
fungi and animals, a few genes have been shown to contain uORFs whose amino acid sequences are similar
between two or more species [12-17], but only two cases,
CPA1 [3] and SAMDC1/AdoMetDC1 [18], have demonstrated uORF sequence-dependent regulation. In plants
two groups of genes, S-Adenosylmethionine decarboxylases (AdoMetDCs; EC 4.1.1.50) and group S basic region
leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors, have been
shown to contain uORFs with similar amino acids
between monocots and dicots [19,20]. In the former
group, mORF translational regulation is dependent on the
sequence of the uORF peptide [1,4] and overexpression of
the mORF in either group results in stunted or lethal phenotypes, suggesting that these genes play a critical role in
growth and/or development. Indeed, AdoMetDC is
required for polyamine synthesis, molecules that are
implicated in essential plant functions such as cell division, embryogenesis, leaf, root, and flower development,
and stress responses [21,22].
In general, it has been difficult to carry out genome-wide
surveys of conserved peptide uORFs due to poor annotation of 5' UTRs. The availability of expressed sequence tags
(ESTs) has improved exon and intron annotation of the
genomic sequence, but they are relatively short and often
do not predict the entire mRNA molecule, even when several ESTs overlap the same genomic region and can be
assembled to predict one transcript. As there are very few
introns in yeast transcripts, prediction of uORF conservation has been attempted in S. cerevisiae by analyzing
genomic sequence upstream of predicted mORF start sites
[23], but it is still not clear whether these uORFs are truly
conserved (i.e., are under negative selection pressures), or
are simply undergoing evolutionary drift. With the
sequencing of the Aspergillus nidulans genome, comparison to A. fumigatus and A. oryzae has identified 38 uORFs
with putatively conserved start and stop codon positions

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/32

relative to the mORF, 14 of which are conserved in one of
Neurospora crassa, Fusarium graminaerum, or Magnaporthe
grisea [5], but the authors did not comment on whether
the uORF amino acid sequences are also conserved.
With the emergence of large plant full-length cDNA
sequence collections [24-26], it is now possible to adopt a
comparative genomics approach to determine the prevalence of conserved amino acid uORFs in the genome and
the persistence of these elements throughout eukaryotic
evolution. Because rice and Arabidopsis shared a common ancestor 140–200 million years ago (Mya) [27-29],
sequence similarity retained over this amount of time provides good candidates for truly conserved peptide uORF
sequences. In this study we have used Oryza sativa (rice)
and Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) full-length cDNA
sequence collections to estimate the incidence of conserved peptide uORFs in the rice and Arabidopsis
genomes, to determine the prevalence of uORFs within
regulatory genes, and to compare evolutionary rates for
uORFs versus mORFs. By examining more distantly
related sequences, we posit an ancient origin for select
uORFs and we provide evidence for one mechanism by
which uORFs can arise within genes.

Results
Identification of conserved peptide uORFs by comparison
of rice and Arabidopsis transcripts
To identify conserved peptide uORFs, we developed
"uORF-Finder", a Perl program that first compares the
mORF amino acid sequence of each cDNA from one collection with the mORF sequences of another species' collection to identify putative mORF homologs, and then
compares the uORFs in the 5' UTRs of the two paired
sequences to identify uORFs with conserved amino acid
sequences (see Methods). Comparison by uORF-Finder of
a corrected set of 34000 full-length cDNA sequences from
Arabidopsis with a similar set from rice resulted in the
identification of conserved peptide uORFs in 44 Arabidopsis genes and 36 rice genes, which together comprise
19 homology groups based on uORF amino acid similarity (Tables 1, 2, 3; Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). All three of the
homology groups that had been previously reported were
identified by uORF-Finder [1,4]. The other 16 conserved
uORFs have not been reported previously. Homologs of
these 19 conserved uORF groups also exist in other
angiosperm species (Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).
Comparison of Arabidopsis homologs detects additional
conserved uORFs
Conserved uORFs that are not sufficiently well conserved
to be detected in a rice-Arabidopsis comparison could
conceivably be detected in ohnologs, homologous genes
arising by whole-genome duplication (WGD) [30], and in
paralogs, homologous genes arising from segmental

duplication or tandem duplication. Modification of
uORF-Finder allowed comparison of each full-length
cDNA to all other cDNAs in the same collection (see
Methods), and identified seven additional conserved
uORF homology groups (Tables 1 and 4; Figures 6, 7, 8).
Six of these pairs are ohnologs, created by the most recent
WGD (24–40 Mya) in an ancestor of Arabidopsis [31-33].
The seventh pair is not found in syntenic regions and is
most likely a paralogous pair. It appears to have arisen at
about the same time as the recent WGD event because its
synonymous substitution frequency (Ks value) of 0.7 is
similar to the median Ks of recent duplicate pairs (0.8) and
is within their Ks range (0.4–1.6) [32]. The corresponding
rice genes in four of the seven homology groups possess
uORFs, but lack sufficient uORF sequence similarity to
have been detected in the Arabidopsis-rice comparison
(Figures 6, 7, 8).

Purifying selection maintains uORF amino acid sequences
Pairwise Ka/Ks tests for selection on amino acid sequences
were applied to each uORF homology group and their
associated mORFs to determine whether uORF amino
acid sequences are under selective constraints similar to
their associated mORFs. Both an approximate method
(Yn00) and a maximum likelihood method (codeml)
were used to calculate mean pairwise Ka/Ks ratios for each
group. A Ka/Ks ratio less than 1 implies that negative, or
purifying, selection has acted on the sequence, a ratio
equal to 1 suggests drift, and a ratio greater than 1 indicates that positive selection has acted on an amino acid
sequence. It is also true that conservation at the nucleotide
level, not the amino acid level, can drive the Ka/Ks ratio to
one. Analysis of all 26 homology groups showed that generally both uORFs and mORFs have been under mild to
strong purifying selection since the divergence of each
gene pair (Table 5) and these low Ka/Ks ratios suggest that

Figure 7
Alignments of plant uORF homology groups 22 and 23
Alignments of plant uORF homology groups 22 and 23. Details as in Figure 6.

the conservation is at the amino acid level, not simply at
the nucleotide level.
One possible explanation for low Ka/Ks ratios in the putative uORFs invokes an incomplete splicing of the fulllength cDNAs for which the uORF and mORF are normally fused. To address this possibility, all Genbank Arabidopsis ESTs were screened for evidence of uORF-mORF
translational fusions. No ORFs were found to run continuously between the uORF and mORF, with one exception.

A fusion product (Genbank accession no. DR353698) was
identified between the N-terminal and central region of
the uORF and the central and C-terminal region of the
mORF found at locus At5g03190 (group 17). Classification of this putative uORF is shown in Table 1 for two reasons. Firstly, the four uORF C-terminal amino acids that
are excluded in the fusion EST are perfectly conserved in
monocot and dicot members, and the position of their
stop codon is perfectly conserved, therefore it is difficult
to explain this conservation if the uORF is not translated.

cuORF found upstream of annotated mORF-containing locus (within 2 kb).

Secondly, the N-terminal portion of the mORF that is
removed in the fusion EST is similar between three Arabidopsis loci of the same homology group, with the start
codon position also being conserved in these three members. It is likely, therefore, that the fusion EST represents
an alternatively spliced form of this transcript, but further
characterization of this locus will be needed to support
this conclusion. Most of the homology groups show
uORFs with conserved amino acid residues at the C-terminus and an identical positioning of the uORF stop codon
(Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8). This would suggest that the
full-length cDNAs are fully spliced and are not erroneously predicting uORF sequences due to incomplete splicing.
Conserved features of uORF sequences
The lengths of uORFs vary to differing degrees within and
among homology groups, but in amino acid sequence
alignments nearly all groups exhibit considerable conservation of the position of the N-terminus and/or the C-terminus, i.e., length variation is usually due to a variable
region in the middle or at one end of the uORF (Table 6;
Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8). The amino acid sequences of

some uORFs possess potentially interesting features.
Notably, some uORF groups possess regions rich in serine, threonine, and/or tyrosine, and others possess
regions rich in lysine and/or arginine. Two homology
groups are particularly noteworthy: Group 8 uORFs specify peptides with a coiled coil-helix, coiled coil-helix
(CHCH) domain (Pfam accession number PF06747; Figure 9), and group 13 uORFs encode peptides that are
extremely serine/arginine-rich (Figure 10). Both of these
unusual peptides will be discussed in further detail below.
Most genes with conserved uORFs appear to have
regulatory functions
A total of 31% of mORFs encoded by conserved peptide
uORF loci in Arabidopsis were predicted to be a transcription factor, as determined by GO molecular function
terms (Tables 2 and 4), whereas only 5.9% of all Arabidopsis loci are predicted to encode transcription factors
[34]. Thus, genes predicted to encode transcription factors
are significantly overrepresented (p = 1.2 × 10-7) among
conserved peptide uORF loci. In each case, GO terms were
validated by manual annotation of protein functions
using domain predictions from NCBI Conserved Domain

and InterProScan Database searches [35,36]. A variety of
different types of transcription factors, including bZIP,
Ethylene Response Factor/Apetala 2-like (ERF/AP2-like),
basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH), and homeobox proteins,
are represented among conserved peptide uORF loci with
no demonstrable bias. No other GO terms were found to
be significantly over- or under-represented in the uORF
data set.
Biological functions could be inferred for 16 of the 26
uORF homology groups (Table 1). Six groups encode
transcription factor homologs and so are presumably
involved in transcriptional control (1, 2, 14, 15, 18, and
21). Five groups are likely to be involved in signal transduction, including four protein kinases and a putative cal-

modulin-binding protein involved in auxin response
(groups 10, 16, 19, 23, 25). Two groups are involved in
the metabolism of small molecules that regulate plant
development: polyamines (group 3) [1] and trehalose
(group 11) [37]. One group (13) encodes the key enzyme
in the biosynthesis of phosphocholine, which is an intermediate in biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine and
phosphatidic acid; phosphocholine levels influence levels
of phosphatidic acid, an important physiological and
developmental signal molecule [38-40]. Group 7 putatively encodes translation initiation factor eIF5, which
influences start codon selection, and Group 26 encodes a
RING finger protein, suggesting a role in targeted protein
turnover by ubiquitination. Of the remaining 10 groups,
8 encode predicted proteins of unknown function, 1
encodes an ankyrin-repeat protein, and 1 encodes an
amine oxidase. Thus, all but two families of conserved
uORF genes whose functions are known or can be inferred
potentially play a regulatory role in the biology of plants.
Genes with conserved uORFs were preferentially retained
after whole genome duplication
Since the most recent WGD event in the Arabidopsis lineage, only 14% of the original gene pairs present in the
ancestral tetraploid have been retained as a duplicate pair
in the extant Arabidopsis genome, i.e., for the remaining
86% of ancestral gene pairs, one member has been lost
[32]. Among 31 ancestral gene pairs that possessed conserved uORFs at the time immediately following the
genome duplication, 12 (39%) pairs have been retained
in the present Arabidopsis genome (Table 2), which is significantly higher than the genome-wide average (p =
0.0005). The conserved uORF was retained in both copies
of each of the twelve retained duplicate pairs. Retention of
these 12 uORFs in both paralogs suggests that they act in
cis, consistent with the expectation that uORFs typically
control translation of downstream mORFs on the same
RNA molecule [41].

The overrepresentation of transcription factors among
conserved uORF loci could be due, in part, to preferential
retention of transcription factor recent duplicates (22.7%
retention of transcription factor duplicates vs 14.4%
retention genome-wide) [32], but this alone does not
account for the high frequency of predicted transcription
factors among the uORF loci. When duplicate history bias
is removed by calculating GO term frequencies of the pregenome-duplication set of loci, transcription factors are
still overrepresented (11/31 loci, or 35%).
Conserved angiosperm uORF peptide sequences in
primitive plants and other eukaryotes
To determine whether any of the 19 uORF homology
groups conserved between rice and Arabidopsis might
also be present in other eukaryotes, we searched for uORF

sequences in all Genbank eukaryotic ESTs. Amino acid
sequences similar to four homology groups (3, 8, 13, and
15) were detected in non-angiosperms. Group 15 was
found only as distantly as a fern (Adiantum); group 3 was
found as far from angiosperms as the green algae (Ulva);
group 13 was found in an animal (Xenopus tropicalis); and
group 8 uORF sequence was found in primitive plants,
animals, fungi, and a slime mold (Figures 9 and 10).
Another algal sequence (Chlamydomonas) from the Genbank non-redundant database was identified belonging to
group 3 (Genbank: AJ841703). The group 13 uORF
homolog found in a X. tropicalis EST was also found in a
genomic contig sequence [42] in which the uORF
homolog is flanked by genes that are more similar to animal sequences than to any known plant sequences. Thus,
this group 13 uORF homolog most likely exists in the

Xenopus genome rather than being an EST library contaminant.
Sequences similar to group 8 Arabidopsis and rice uORFs
were found in most eukaryotes, but transcript sequence
following the uORF varied among the different lineages.
All land plant uORFs were associated with macrophage
inhibitory cytokine-1-like (Mic1-like) mORF sequences
while the mORFs downstream of the group 8 uORF
homologs in nematodes and arthropods code for an
unknown protein and a putative mannosyl transferase,
respectively (Figure 11). Available EST sequences for each
of the group 8 uORF homologs in mammals, fungi, algae,
and slime mold end shortly after the conserved peptide
uORF, suggesting that in these eukaryotes the uORF
homolog is not associated with a mORF and is simply a

Group 89small ORF/uORF alignment and percent identity across various eukaryotes
Group 8 small ORF/uORF alignment and percent identity across various eukaryotes. Representative eukaryotic
species aligned using Muscle and displayed by percent identity using Jalview. Arrowheads represent two conserved intron positions for all but Mesvi (no genomic support), Dicdi (first but not second intron present), Ciosa (no introns), Caeel (no introns),
Drome (no introns), and Neucr (first but not second intron present based on predicted mRNA). See main text for abbreviated

short ORF. This is further supported by more than 10
human ESTs that end at the same position and include a
polyA sequence. In the sea squirt lineage a putative mORF
is present in the EST sequences, but a full-length cDNA
sequence will be needed to further investigate this possibility.
Although there is variability in the sequences found
downstream of group 8 uORFs, three features of these
uORF homologs are relatively well conserved: the length
of the predicted uORF, the relative positions of four
cysteine codons, and the positions of two introns (Figure
9). The length of the uORF peptide ranges from 51 amino
acids in Haemonchus (nematode), to 74 amino acids in
humans, and length is even more highly conserved within
each of the land plant, arthropod, nematode, fungal, and
vertebrate lineages (59–62, 65–69, 51–68, 54–66, and

69–74 amino acids, respectively). Four cysteine residues
consistently align in all eukaryotes, with nine amino acids
separating the first and second cysteine residues, as well as
the third and fourth cysteine residues, whereas 11–15 residues separate the second and third cysteines. Two intron
positions are perfectly conserved among the land plants,
vertebrates, and at least one member of the fungal lineage.
The first intron lies between the third and fourth amino
acids following the first conserved cysteine position, and
the second intron lies between the fourth and fifth amino
acids following the fourth conserved cysteine position
(Figure 11). The first and/or second intron positions are
present in Dictyostelium, algae, and some fungi, but are
absent in nematodes, arthropods, and sea squirts.
The four cysteines are part of a putative coiled coil-helix,
coiled coil-helix (CHCH) domain (Pfam accession

number PF06747), also found in three small yeast proteins, Cox17p, Cox19p, and Mrp10p. Cox17p and
Cox19p are required for assembly of functional cytochrome oxidase and Mrp10p is homologous to a nuclearencoded mitochondrial ribosomal protein. A hypothetical human gene, CHCH domain 7 (CHCHD7), is also
similar to the group 8 uORF, as determined by BLAST similarity searches.
Phylogenetic relationships among group 8-like ORFs
Fungal, animal, and plant representatives of each CHCHcontaining ORF were identified using a BLAST search, and
their evolutionary relationships were inferred using a
Bayesian phylogenetic analysis (Figure 12; Additional file

1). Animal Mrp10p-like (Genbank: BC075310,
DR155443 and BX935835), Debaryomyces group 8-like
(Genbank: NC_006045), and Dictyostelium Cox19p-like
(Genbank: XM_631387) sequences were more divergent
than other sequences, causing long branch attraction [43].
Thus, these sequences were removed from the analysis to
prevent tree topology distortion. Five distinct clades were
observed, which we refer to as Cox17p-like, Cox19p-like,
Mrp10p-like, CHCHD7-like, and uORF group 8-like (Figure 12). All clades but one (Mrp10p-like) contain representatives from fungi, animals, and plants and are
strongly supported, showing branch order probabilities
greater than 0.8, which suggests that these sequences
emerged in a common eukaryotic ancestor and have since
diverged in the three lineages. Mrp10p-like sequences do
not strongly group independently of other branches (P =
0.57), which could be due to highly divergent amino acid
sequence represented by relatively long branches. The tree
shows that the group 8-like proteins are a distinct clade
from other CHCH domain proteins (P = 1.0), and that
CHCHD7-like proteins are more closely related to group
8-like members than to other CHCH-containing proteins
(P = 0.94). The tree topology also indicates that Cox17plike and Cox19p-like genes are more closely related to
each other than to other CHCH proteins (P = 0.97).
A separate phylogenetic analysis of the 46 group 8-like
sequences shows that most cluster into five taxonomic
groups (plants and green algae, arthropods, nematodes,
vertebrates, and fungi) with strong branch support (0.85–
1.00) in all but the fungal lineage (0.58; Figure 13). Sea
squirt sequences group with one of two Branchiostoma
sequences with weak branch support (0.53). Dictyostelium,
sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus), and one further Branchiostoma sequence do not group with any of these with weak
support (0.53). Sea squirt, Branchiostoma, and sea urchin
sequences should be more similar to other deuterastomes
(includes the vertebrate lineage) than other organisms,
but the short group 8-like sequence alignment could prevent resolution of correct evolutionary relationships of
some groups (Additional file 2). Despite weakly supported branches, there is strong support for independent
clustering of the arthropods, nematodes, vertebrates and
plants, as expected.
Although two Branchiostoma group 8-like sequences
(Brafl1 and 2) suggest that there has been a duplication
event within this lineage, there is no evidence for maintenance of ancient group 8-like gene duplications occurring
within the plant, vertebrate, nematode, arthropod, or fungal lineages. In Arabidopsis both the recent and ancient
duplicates from two WGD events have been lost from the
genome. Only the Mesostigma genome contains two group
8-like transcripts. Their short branch lengths indicate that
this duplication occurred relatively recently and it is pos-

sible that insufficient time has passed for loss of the second copy.

Discussion and conclusion
Comparative analysis by uORF-Finder of 5' UTRs in fulllength cDNAs from two distantly related plant species,
rice and Arabidopsis, identified conserved peptide uORFs
in 58 Arabidopsis loci that comprised 26 uORF homology
groups and in 36 rice loci that comprised 19 homology
groups, increasing the number of known conserved uORF
homology groups from two to 26 and providing useful,

new information for investigations of regulatory biology.
Because full-length cDNAs derived from both Arabidopsis
and rice only represent a fraction of all nuclear genes, not
all conserved uORFs are expected to be detected by this
approach. Extrapolation to the whole Arabidopsis
genome suggests that it possesses approximately 61 to 102
genes with conserved peptide uORFs that are also conserved in the rice genome (see Methods for calculation).
An additional 24 conserved peptide uORF genes are predicted among Arabidopsis loci with retained duplicates
from the most recent WGD event. In all, there are likely to

be approximately 99–140 genes, or 0.38–0.53% of all
protein-coding genes, with conserved peptide uORFs in
the Arabidopsis genome. Because short conserved uORFs
(<20 amino acids) would not have been detected by
uORF-Finder, this is a conservative estimate.
To find additional conserved uORFs, more extensive collections of full-length cDNA sequences will need to be
developed and/or 5' UTRs predicted from genomic
sequence will be required. As full-length cDNA sequence

resources become available for other plant species, such as
maize [44] and poplar [45], it should be possible to identify additional conserved uORFs that might be specific to
taxonomic groups, such as monocotyledons or dicotyledons. Similarly, analysis of ancient tetraploidy events in
species such as poplar and maize might be able to identify
uORFs conserved between retained duplicates.

BMC Biology 2007, 5:32

Conserved uORF genes are regulatory genes
Based on the study of a few hundred genes, it has been
suggested that uORFs are usually associated with mORFs
that encode proteins that regulate cell growth [41,46], but
a genome-wide study of upstream AUGs (uAUGs) found
no correlation of uAUG-containing transcripts with any
particular gene ontology (GO) molecular function term in
mammalian transcripts [6]. These observations did not
differentiate between sequence-dependent and sequenceindependent uORFs. Our analysis shows that genes
encoding transcription factors are overrepresented among
genes predicted to encode conserved peptide uORFs, representing almost one third of the 58 Arabidopsis loci as
compared to 6% of all genes. Moreover, nearly all genes
whose function can be reasonably inferred appear to play
some regulatory role in the biology of plants.
Do conserved peptide uORFs mediate feedback
translational regulation by small regulatory molecules?
Certain eukaryotic conserved peptide uORFs are known to
control translation of a downstream mORF in response to
a metabolic product such as arginine or polyamines
[4,14,47]. In the case of the fungal arginine-regulated carbamoyl-phosphate synthase subunit, a uORF codes for
the arginine attenuator peptide that responds to increased
arginine concentrations by causing ribosomes to stall near
the 3' end of the uORF, interfering with ribosome scanning and translation of the downstream mORF [14]. A
similar mechanism has been elucidated for the regulation
of AdoMetDC in which the uORF peptide interferes with
the termination of uORF translation in a polyaminedependent manner [48,49]. In plants, sucrose is a signaling molecule that controls not only the transcription of
many genes, but also translation of a class of bZIP transcription factors via their conserved uORF, suggesting the
possibility of sucrose interaction with a uORF-encoded
peptide to regulate translation downstream [4].

Our analysis identified not only these previously known
examples of genes involved in pathways exhibiting small
molecule feedback in a uORF sequence-dependent manner, but several additional genes that might also act via
this mechanism. One is the conserved group 13 uORFs,
which are present in genes that encode phosphoethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEAMT/NMT), the key
enzyme in phosphocholine (PCho) biosynthesis.
Recently, NMT1 has been shown to contain a uORF that
differentially affects translation of the mORF in response
to exogenously added choline [50]. This effect is observed
when the uORF start codon is abolished but it remains to
be determined whether the response to choline is uORF
sequence-specific. Intriguingly, the group 13 uORF peptide is rich in arginine and serine (40–48% in Arabidopsis
and rice genes; Table 6). A variety of arginine-rich peptides
15–20 amino acids long with 5 or more arginines bind to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/32

specific RNA sequences [51]. The predicted group 13
uORF peptide has 5–7 arginines in a 16–17 amino acid
region, well within this range, suggesting the possibility
that it might bind to a specific RNA sequence, perhaps in
PEAMT/NMT transcripts. The fact that the group 13 uORF
peptide was also found in Xenopus suggests that its regulatory role is widespread in eukaryotes.
Another example is homology group 11, whose mORFs
are predicted to encode trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (TPPase); trehalose-6-phosphate is postulated to
regulate sugar metabolism in plants [37]. In summary,
sucrose, polyamines, phosphatidic acid, and trehalose-6phosphate are possible regulators of translation of downstream mORFs through interaction with conserved
uORFs. Also interesting in this light are group 19, which
specifies an auxin-induced calmodulin-binding homolog,
and group 15, which encodes a bHLH transcription factor
that is believed to be subject to translational control
through its conserved uORF by spermine synthase [52].
Spermine is a polyamine signal molecule necessary for
normal plant growth and defense responses.
As mentioned, six conserved uORF families specify transcription factors, one of which is regulated by the small
signaling molecule sucrose. In plants, transcription factors
often act quantitatively to control target gene expression
proportionate to transcription factor concentration [53].
Therefore, it is interesting to consider the possibility that
translational control of transcription factor protein levels
could be mediated by interaction of a conserved uORF
peptide with a metabolite. This might be an effective
means for quantitatively modulating the levels of expression of a pathway or network of downstream genes, for
instance, in response to changing physiological or environmental conditions. This logic can equally be applied to
other key control proteins and their uORFs.
How is translational control mediated by conserved
peptide uORFs?
If conserved uORF peptides can regulate mORF levels in
response to small molecules, they are clearly analogous to
RNA sensors and riboswitches that sense small molecules
and regulate transcript translation accordingly [28,54]. It
is interesting to think of conserved peptide uORFs too as
sensors of cellular, physiological, or developmental conditions. Although the role of conserved uORFs as 'sensors'
of cellular metabolites has been clearly established in the
cases of polyamine, sucrose, and arginine concentration,
it is still not clear how uORF peptides gauge cellular conditions. uORF peptides could affect mORF translation by
interacting directly with the ribosomal complex, by associating with other proteins that influence the translational
machinery, and/or by stabilizing or destabilizing RNA secondary structures in the 5' UTR that impede or promote

mORF translation. Given the variety of uORF peptides
represented in the 26 homology groups, each of these possibilities could occur one or more times.
It is perhaps interesting to note also that the uORFs of 9
homology groups are rich in serine, threonine, and/or
tyrosine. These amino acids are potential targets for phosphorylation that conceivably could promote or inhibit
ribosome stalling or initiation at downstream mORFs. As
mentioned above, lysine/arginine-rich motifs could function in RNA binding [51].
Effect of nonsense-mediated decay on uORF transcripts
Because uORFs create a premature termination codon
(PTC), the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) system
might target uORF transcripts for degradation. Yoine et al
[55] carried out a microarray analysis of plants mutant in
the UPF1 ortholog, which is required for NMD.

Among 75 genes that Yoine et al identified that accumulate transcripts at more than twice the level in the upf1
mutant as in wild type Arabidopsis, we found representatives of seven uORF homology groups (1, 7, 10, 12, 13,
15, and 17), suggesting that these uORF transcripts are
susceptible to nonsense-mediated decay. The uORFs in
these groups might work in a manner analogous to the
uORF arginine attenuator protein (AAP) in the fungal
CPA1 transcript. The CPA1 transcript exclusively exhibits
increased levels of degradation via NMD when the AAP
inhibits translation termination in response to high levels
of arginine, ultimately decreasing translation using a twopronged approach [56]. Similarly, the above-identified
plant uORFs could intensify translational inhibition of
their associated mORFs by both blocking the ribosome
physically and inducing the NMD pathway.
Evolutionary emergence of uORFs and a 'transcriptional
fusion' model
Very little is known about how uORFs arise. In the extant
rice and Arabidopsis genomes, sequences homologous to
uORFs identified by uORF-Finder were observed only in
5' UTRs and never as part of another mORF, within 3'
UTRs, within introns, or in non-transcribed regions. Possible origins of 5' UTR ORFs include (a) fragmentation of
mORF sequences, (b) creation of an AUG or alternate start
codon by random mutation within the 5' UTR and subsequent selection for the peptide sequence, and (c) relocation of other ORF sequences within the genome to the 5'
UTR or upstream region of a given gene and subsequent
transcriptional fusion of the two ORFs.

Transcriptional fusions occur in an estimated 2% of adjacently transcribed mRNAs in the human genome [57].
The evolutionary history of uORF homology group 8 suggests a stable transcriptional fusion model leading to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/32

uORF emergence in plants, arthropods and nematodes.
Group 8 uORFs are associated with three independent
mORFs in the land plant, arthropod and nematode lineages, while the vertebrate, slime mold, algal, and fungal
small ORFs that are orthologous to group 8 uORFs do not
seem to be associated with mORFs. Given the phylogenetic relationships among these species [58], the most
parsimonious explanation for the evolutionary origin of
group 8 uORFs is that they originated as a small ORF transcribed independently of a mORF. Subsequently, this
small ORF gene was displaced via genome rearrangements
or transposition events to regions upstream of three independent large ORFs resulting in transcriptional fusions of
the two previously independent transcripts. The uORFs
and mORFs in the plant, nematode, and arthropod lineages have remained associated within the same transcript
for 300–500 My, therefore these transcriptional fusion
events seem to be stable and perhaps biologically advantageous. Evidence for other uORF emergence models,
such as mORF fragmentation or de novo creation, will
require further analysis of closely related organisms.
Potential dual role for uORF proteins
uORFs can regulate specific mORF protein expression in
trans when the cis uORF is intact [59,60] but it is still
unclear whether uORF proteins can play additional roles
in the cell. Small proteins, similar in length to uORFs, play
a role in plant development and could also be involved in
plant defense [61,62]. Potentially, uORFs could affect
such processes independently of their role as a translational regulator. Homology group 8 uORFs are largely
conserved in length, sequence, and intron position across
most eukaryotes, but in fungi, algae, slime mold, and vertebrates, the associated mORF seems to be absent. The
absence of the mORF and strong conservation of the
uORF amino acid sequence over one billion years in these
eukaryotes indicates that, in plants, this protein could act
as both a regulator of mORF expression and as a trans acting factor in the cell.

Group 13 uORFs contain peptides similar to RS motifs
found in SR proteins. SR proteins are a family of proteins
required for alternative and constitutive pre-mRNA splicing [63,64]. A subset of these proteins, shuttling SR proteins, have not only been implicated in splicing but have
also been shown to stimulate translation of a reporter
gene when fused to the same transcript [65], analogous to
a uORF-mORF associated pair. It is possible then, that
group 13 uORF proteins could also play a dual role, as a
translational regulator and trans factor.
Similarly, some uORFs in mammalian genomes might
adopt these dual roles and further characterization of conserved mammalian uORFs [66] could resolve a dual role
model.

Applications
Ka/Ks analyses suggest that conserved peptide uORFs are
under mild to strong negative selection and might therefore be useful for resolving orthology and paralogy of specific gene pairs. For example, phylogenetic studies have
sometimes failed to identify all members within a uORF
homology group when only considering the mORF
sequence (e.g. homology group 2). Although the bHLH
transcription factor domain occurs in the mORF of all
three group 2 members, none were identified in the original studies, and only two of the three members have been
included in the latest description of Arabidopsis bHLH
family members [67-69].

Further characterization of conserved peptide uORFs and
their functional mechanisms might also provide useful
tools for creating inducible or repressible expression vectors in plants. AdoMetDC1, bZIP11, and PEAMT/NMT1
protein levels are regulated by conserved uORFs in a
metabolite-dependent manner (polyamine, sucrose, and
choline, respectively) and other conserved uORFs might
also regulate mORF translation in response to cellular
compounds, such as TPPases. If this is the case, further
functional characterization of conserved peptide uORFs
could provide the tools necessary to build constructs that
are quickly inducible or repressible at the translational
level under various conditions.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/32

the putative uORFs, the first 100 amino acids of the Arabidopsis mORF were aligned to Genbank plant ESTs using
tBLASTn (E-value = 1e-10, limit: Viridiplantae [orgn] NOT
Arabidopsis [orgn], complexity filter off), and all retrieved
plant uORF sequences were aligned to rice and Arabidopsis uORFs using ClustalW [74], manually adjusted, and
visualized using Jalview [75] (Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8).
There were two exceptions to this procedure. Because the
uORFs in group 10 are 400–600 bp upstream of the
mORF AUG, only the first 25 mORF amino acids were
used to search Genbank plant ESTs (first 25 amino acids
are very highly conserved). Secondly, high identity was
limited to the 3' end of mORFs in group 17, therefore the
Arabidopsis transcript's terminal 50 amino acids were
aligned to Genbank non-EST plant sequences. Support for
a conserved uORF was found in the Medicago truncatula
and Lotus corniculatus genomic sequences.
To test whether uORFs appear upstream of non-homologous genes, Arabidopsis uORF sequences were aligned to
the entire Arabidopsis genome (version 5) [76] using
tBLASTn (E-value = 10). Predicted conserved uORFs were
found to lie upstream of the annotated gene instead of in
the annotated 5' UTR in approximately 10% of Arabidopsis and 25% of rice genes (Tables 2, 3, 4). The discrepancies with the accepted annotations, found at TAIR [76]
and TIGR [77], respectively, demonstrate the benefit of
using full-length cDNA sequences for this analysis.

Methods
Identifying conserved uORFs in rice and Arabidopsis
Corrected RIKEN and Genoscope Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia and NIAS, FAIS and RIKEN Oryza sativa
spp. japonica cv Nipponbare full-length cDNA collections
were used for all analysis [70]. A cDNA's major ORF
(mORF) was defined as the longest ORF starting with an
AUG, the sequence upstream of this AUG was designated
the 5' UTR, and upstream ORFs (uORFs) were any ORFs
found in the 5' UTR starting with an AUG. All ORFs were
identified using getorf [71]. Arabidopsis mORFs were
aligned to rice cDNAs using tBLASTn with an E-value cutoff = 1e-5 [72,73] to find putative homologs. Rice cDNAs
with hits below this threshold were paired with their
respective Arabidopsis transcript, 5' UTR sequences
extracted from both, uORFs determined using getorf, and
all combinations of rice and Arabidopsis uORF peptide
pairs aligned using needle [71]. The reciprocal analysis
was also performed, starting with rice full-length cDNA
sequences and comparing them to Arabidopsis transcript
sequences. All uORFs greater than 100 amino acids were
excluded from this analysis.

To determine whether sequences similar to these conserved uORFs reside elsewhere in the rice and Arabidopsis
genomes, uORF amino acid sequences were aligned with
sequences translated from the genome sequence using
tBLASTn [73]. Sequences similar to these uORFs were
found within 5' UTRs of homologous mORF loci, and
were absent from non-homologous transcripts, intronic
regions, and intergenic regions with only one exception,
Arabidopsis NMT3 (AGI locus identifier At1g73600). The
annotated mORF for NMT3 [78] is not covered by any
available full-length cDNA and has no EST support at its
5' end. Thus, we annotated NMT3 by comparison with its
paralog, NMT1 (At3g18000) [33]. NMT3 possesses
sequences similar to the NMT1 uORF, as well as sequences
similar to the NMT1 mORF, but the TAIR annotation fuses
these into a single ORF. However, NMT3 possesses potential splice sites that would produce transcripts with uORF
and mORF sequences similar to those in NMT1. The
NMT3 uORF predicted by one alternative splice model is
the same length as, and is 72% identical to, the NMT1
uORF amino acid sequence (Group 13 in Figure 4).

All pairs with scores >50 were kept and examined manually against existing Arabidopsis transcript annotations
(TAIR and TIGR) and existing ESTs to determine whether
aligned peptides fall within a probable 5' UTR. To validate

The TAIR website was used to assign locus numbers for
each Arabidopsis transcript and the TIGR website for rice
locus numbers. The Arabidopsis locus numbers were then
used to search for retained duplicates from the recent and

ancient whole genome duplications as defined on the Arabidopsis Paralogon website [33].
Calculating Ka/Ks
For homology groups 1–19, Ka/Ks values for homologous
rice and Arabidopsis mORFs and uORFs were determined
using pairwise_kaks.PLS (version 1.7) [79]. Both the
approximate method (option-kaks yn00) and the maximum likelihood method (-kaks codeml) were used. Any
Ka/Ks values resulting from a Ka or Ks value >10 was
excluded from the analysis, as these values result in inaccurate predictions of Ka/Ks [80,81]. The Ka/Ks values for
homology groups 20–26 were determined with the same
approach
using
Arabidopsis
sequences
only.
GO molecular function terms
GO molecular function terms [82] were retrieved from
TAIR Locus History pages [76]. GO terms for all Arabidopsis loci were downloaded from the TAIR website and used
to compare genome-wide GO molecular function term
frequencies to those found in the conserved uORF-containing loci. Statistically significant differences were
detected using the Exact Binomial test as described in the
R program package [83]. This analysis was also carried out
by GeneMerge, a program that incorporates a Bonferroni
corrected P-value [84].
Identification of Arabidopsis ohnologs and paralogs with
conserved uORF
Conserved uORFs were found in Arabidopsis duplicates
in much the same way as conserved uORFs were found
between rice and Arabidopsis. uORFs and mORFs were
defined in the same way, and mORF sequences were
aligned to the entire Arabidopsis full-length cDNA collection using BLASTp (E-value cutoff = 1e-5) to detect transcripts deriving from a duplicated locus. mORFs aligning
with ≥ 99% identity were discarded, and uORFs of all
remaining pairs were aligned using needle and validated
as above.
Generation of phylogenetic trees
Sequences similar to Cox17p, Cox19p, Mrp10, CHCHD7,
and uORF homology group 8 (as determined by tBLASTn
and analyzed for conservation of the CHCH motif) were
aligned using Muscle [85], trimmed of non-informative
sites, and analyzed using Mr. Bayes v. 3.0 [86] (rates =
gamma, aamodel = mixed, ngen = 2000000). Phylogenetic trees were visualized using PHYLIP's DRAWTREE
program v. 3.65 [87].

Sequences similar to uORF homology group 8 were
aligned, edited, and analyzed in the same manner with
one exception, ngen = 3000000.

Estimate of conserved peptide uORF prevalence
Number of Arabidopsis-rice loci
There is an average of 2.23 full-length cDNAs per uORF
locus identified (excluding loci identified by BLAST alignment), which suggests that 15200 Arabidopsis genes are
represented in the cDNA collections (34000 cDNAs/2.23
cDNAs per locus), representing approximately 60% of all
Arabidopsis genes (assuming 26000 genes) [88]. In addition, Kikuchi et al [25] report that the 28000 rice fulllength cDNA sequences represent 20000 transcription
units (TUs) and that 64% of these (12800) have a
homolog in Arabidopsis. Assuming that 60–100% of
these homologs are represented in the Arabidopsis cDNA
collections, the estimated number of Arabidopsis
homologs screened for uORF conservation is 7800–
13000. Only 80% of Arabidopsis genes also have a
homolog in rice (~21000) [25], therefore the uORFFinder program has identified 37–62% of all conserved
upstream ORFs (7800/21000 to 13000/21000) when
comparing rice and Arabidopsis full-length cDNAs. Therefore, there should be 61–102 loci that contain conserved
uORFs: 38 loci found by uORF-Finder, 6 additional loci
found by aligning known uORF sequences with the Arabidopsis genome using BLAST, and 17–58 presently unidentified loci. Using both uORF-Finder and BLAST
algorithms we estimate that between 43% and 72% of
conserved peptide uORFs between monocots and dicots
have been identified.
Number of Arabidopsis-Arabidopsis loci
A total of 60% of Arabidopsis genes are represented in the
full-length cDNA collections used for this study. Therefore, the probability of selecting two loci that have conserved peptide uORFs from the pool of known sequences
is 0.6*0.6 = 0.36. This translates to a total of 38 loci that
have conserved uORFs using an Arabidopsis-Arabidopsis
comparison (14 identified (36%), and 24 unidentified).
Total loci
We therefore predict that there are between 99 and 140
loci in the Arabidopsis genome that contain conserved
peptide uORFs, 41–58% of which have been identified.
