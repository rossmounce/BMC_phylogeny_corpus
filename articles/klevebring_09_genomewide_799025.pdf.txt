Abstract
Background: Short RNAs, and in particular microRNAs, are important regulators of gene
expression both within defined regulatory pathways and at the epigenetic scale. We investigated
the short RNA (sRNA) population (18-24 nt) of the transcriptome of green leaves from the
sequenced Populus trichocarpa using a concatenation strategy in combination with 454 sequencing.
Results: The most abundant size class of sRNAs were 24 nt. Long Terminal Repeats were
particularly associated with 24 nt sRNAs. Additionally, some repetitive elements were associated
with 22 nt sRNAs. We identified an sRNA hot-spot on chromosome 19, overlapping a region
containing both the proposed sex-determining locus and a major cluster of NBS-LRR genes. A
number of phased siRNA loci were identified, a subset of which are predicted to target PPR and
NBS-LRR disease resistance genes, classes of genes that have been significantly expanded in Populus.
Additional loci enriched for sRNA production were identified and characterised. We identified 15
novel predicted microRNAs (miRNAs), including miRNA*sequences, and identified a novel locus
that may encode a dual miRNA or a miRNA and short interfering RNAs (siRNAs).
Conclusions: The short RNA population of P. trichocarpa is at least as complex as that of
Arabidopsis thaliana. We provide a first genome-wide view of short RNA production for P.
trichocarpa and identify new, non-conserved miRNAs.

Background
Plants produce a diverse and dynamic population of small
RNAs (sRNAs) that are involved in transcriptional and
post-transcriptional gene silencing and directing DNA
methylation [1-4]. Distinct sub-populations of sRNAs
have been identified and experimental evidence derived

from Arabidopsis thaliana mutants has shown that each
sub-population is derived via distinct biogenesis routes:
microRNAs (miRNAs) are produced via the action of the
Dicer-like RNAseIII-type ribonuclease DCL1 and are
cleaved from precursor near-perfect stem-loop hairpins
formed from RNA polymerase II transcripts; 21 nucleotide

(nt) endogenous short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) derive
from long, double-stranded RNAs (dsRNA) and are produced via the action of an RNA-dependent RNA (RDR)
polymerase; trans-acting siRNAs (TAS) are produced primarily by RDR6 together with SGS3 and DCL4, which
yield phased 21 nt siRNAs; 24 nt heterochromatic siRNAs
are produced by the action of the DNA-dependent RNA
polymerase PolIV, RDR2 and DCL3 [1,5]. Work in A. thaliana has made extensive use of high throughput sequencing in combination with sRNA silencing mutants to
elucidate the roles of genes within the different biogenesis
pathways for sRNA classes [6].
The genus Populus is now firmly established as the model
system for forest trees [7]. Populus represents an excellent
model, being suitable for studies focusing on commercial
traits, such as biomass-yield and wood fibre qualities, as
well as association mapping and ecological interaction
studies. As seasonal, hard-wood perennials with an
extended juvenile phase, Populus species undergo a
number of processes that could be expected to involve
some degree of epigenetic control and re-programming.
As such Populus represents an ideal system in which to further understanding of traits such as seasonal senescence,
dormancy/growth-arrest and juvenile to adult phase transition. Populus is also nearly exclusively dioecious, yet currently the mechanism determining gender is unknown.
An increasingly compelling body of evidence exists to suggest that chromosome 19 may be in the process of becoming a ZW style sex chromosome [8-11], with the female
potentially being the heterogametic sex [9], although this
is certainly not clear [8]. Again this is a trait that could
involve an epigenetic component. As long-lived, clonallyreplicating species, poplars and aspens also represent an
excellent opportunity to identify how such long-lived species may have evolved particular means to survive both
abiotic and biotic stresses. Particularly in the case of biotic
factors, long-lived species face the challenge of surviving
repeated attacks from antagonists with short generation
times which are therefore capable of more rapid evolutionary change. Indeed the molecular clock of poplar ticks
considerably more slowly than that of Arabidopsis thaliana [12].
Populus has so far not been exhaustively profiled for
sRNAs, especially when compared to A. thaliana where
there have now been a number of high-throughput
sequencing studies performed [6,13-18] and where an
excellent web resource exists for viewing the available
datasets [19]. Previous work in Populus has either consisted of in silico studies or has been performed to a lower
sequencing depth and has concentrated only on the identification of miRNAs [12,20-22]. To date, none have
described the genomic distribution of other classes of
sRNAs in Populus, despite those representing the majority
of sRNAs produced.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/620

We sequenced sRNAs in the sequenced P. trichocarpa genotype (Nisqually-1) using a concatenation approach in
combination with massively parallel pyrosequencing
(454). Using an established analysis pipeline that draws
on the accumulated knowledge gained from analysing
sRNA data in A. thaliana [23], we characterised sRNAs in
young leaf material and in particular we concentrated on
describing the genomic distribution and context of loci
producing numerous sRNAs as well as identifying predicted trans-acting siRNA and miRNA loci.

Results and Discussion
Sequencing of sRNA using a concatenation strategy
Massively parallel sequencing has provided a technological platform to investigate transcripts far more deeply
than was previously possible. As sequencing read lengths
increase, slightly modified methods can increase throughput several fold. Here we applied a concatenation strategy
as outlined in Figure 1A. After cDNA synthesis and
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification, a concatenation step was carried out. Concatenated amplicons
were sequenced using 454 pyrosequencing [24]. After this
step about half of the number of reads corresponded to
single sRNA, 33% to two sRNAs, 15% to three sRNAs and
only a minor fraction (≈ 0.7%) to four sRNAs (Figure 1B).
In total, this strategy yielded 901,887 small RNA reads
from 546,855 sequencing reads, representing a 65%
increase in throughput. To investigate whether this
approach changed measured sRNA expression levels, we
also performed a small-scale experiment using a subregion of a 454 picotiter plate. Comparison of measured
raw read counts between the concatenated and non-concatenated libraries showed a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.954, indicating that no major changes were
introduced using this approach (Figure 1C). With several
platforms now reaching read lengths of 100 bases or
more, concatenation of cDNA prior to sequencing is a valuable tool in small RNA sequencing experiments for
increasing throughput. One limiting step in our protocol
is the blunt concatenation of double-stranded cDNAs. It is
possible that the ligation reaction can be improved by
introducing a digestion step yielding fragments with protruding ends. Ligation of these fragments could be performed in a similar manner, but likely giving a better yield
of longer fragments. Another step that can be introduced
is gel purification to facilitate clean-up of fragments
longer than, for example 150 base pairs, thereby increasing throughput.

Analysis of the sRNA sequence data was performed using
tools from the UEA sRNA toolkit [23]. Three filtering steps
(size range and complexity, t/rRNA matches, perfect
genomic matches) were employed to extract a subset of
sequences for further analysis. From the 901,887 resultant
sRNA sequences, 363,619 (≈ 40%) passed all filters yielding 80,538 unique sequences with a perfect-match to the

P. trichocarpa genome (Table 1). The largest loss of
sequences occurred at the first filtering step (complexity
and size-range) with many of these sequences likely representing partial degradation products of mRNAs. Filtering
for low complexity is not expected to result in the loss of
any miRNAs as all A. thaliana and P. trichocarpa miRNAs
currently in miRBase (Release 13.0 [25]) contain at least
three different bases. However, some bona fide siRNA may

be removed, but these, if any, would represent a small
minority. A significant percentage (≈ 15%) of sequences
passing the first two filters did not have a perfect match to
the published genome sequence: The current Populus
genome sequence does not contain the centromeric
regions, is a chimeric fusion of the two sequenced haplotypes and contains gaps. In particular, highly repetitive
regions, which typically associate with sRNAs (see below),

Summary of redundant and non-redundant sequence counts after different filtering steps

are under-represented in the assembly. As such it is not
unexpected that some bona fide sequences would not have
perfect matches within the current genome assembly.
Future re-mapping of the dataset to updated genome
assemblies may recover un-mapped reads. The majority of
sequences with a read count above one were 24-mers and
21-mers (Figure 1D). The group of 21 nt sequences were
over-enriched for sequences beginning with a Uracil (U)
nucleotide when compared to all other size classes (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p <0.000413). Although not significant, there was also a tendency for 24 nt sequences to
start with an Adenine (A) nucleotide. These two findings
are similar to those found in A. thaliana [16] and suggest
that the same biogenesis mechanisms are operating in the
two species, as is to be expected.
Comparison to previous Populus studies
There have been three publications relating to sRNAs in
Populus, two of which used traditional Sanger sequencing
[20,21] with the third using 454 pyrosequencing [22]. To
allow direct comparison with our data we used the data
from [22] (Additional files 1 and 2) to re-create a redundant dataset for analysis using the UEA plant sRNA
toolkit. This resulted in 2,459 unique sequences between
18-24 nt after filtering (see Methods), of which 563 were
perfect matches and 1846 were overlapping with the
80,538 unique sequence reads in our dataset.

One notable immediate difference between our dataset
and that of [22] is the frequency distribution of different
sRNA size classes. We found that 24 nt sRNAs were the
most abundant size class, with 21 nt sRNAs also being
highly abundant (Figure 1D). This is in agreement with
previous reports in A. thaliana [6,16], maize [26] and Physcomitrella patens [27]. In contrast, the results presented by
[22] showed clear dominance of 21 nt sRNAs with the second highest size class being 22 nts, followed by 24 nts. Reanalysis using the same filtering criteria as for our data
again revealed a clear dominance of 21 nt sRNAs, however
24 nt sequences were the second highest class followed by
22 nt (combining data across leaves and vegetative buds).
The reason for this difference may be that [22] used a P.
balsamifera clone whereas we used the same genetic clone
as was used to produce the genome sequence, and the
unusually high sequence variation within or between Populus species complicates analysis [12].

Genomic context of sRNA distribution
Since sRNAs often associate with repeats, it was of interest
to analyse the distribution of sRNAs in relation to repeats
in the Populus genome. However, as compared to Arabidopsis, repetitive element annotation in Populus is less
well developed. We performed a RepeatModeler and
RepeatMasker analysis of the Populus genome sequence.
The results from this analysis are available at PopGenIE
[28,29]. For RepeatModeler-identified repeats the majority of sRNAs did not overlap a repeat and only ten repeats
had overlap to >100 unique sRNA with none having >500
overlapping sequences. The maximum number of overlapping sequences was 182 for a repeat that overlaps two
NBS-LRR disease resistance gene models. The sRNAs in
this region showed a clear enrichment for 21 mers. Within
the RepeatMasker data there was clear dominance of 21 nt
sRNAs for those repeats with >100 overlapping sRNAs.
There were also a number of cases where there was dominance of 22 nt sRNAs or near-equal representation of 22
and 24 nt sRNAs with these being overlaps to LTR retrotransposons. For example a repeat on scaffold_132 (position 308756..310627) showed a majority of 22 nt
sequences with substantial numbers of 24 nt sequences
and few sequences from other size classes. Such examples
are potentially interesting considering the findings of [26]
where it was found that there is greater overlap of 22 nt
sRNAs to LTR elements in maize than in Arabidopsis.
Future work using biogenesis mutants will be needed to
clarify whether 22 nt LTR-associated sRNAs in Populus are
more similar to the maize or the Arabidopsis genomes.

In all other repeats there was clear dominance of 24 nt
sRNAs with 21 nt sRNAs also having a significant representation. There were also substantial numbers of 22 nt
sRNAs while other size classes were insignificant. In general, the RepeatMasker data matched the results that have
been reported in A. thaliana [6,16].
RepeatMasker was used to identify all Populus and Rosid
repeats in RepBase [30] (release 14.03). RepBase contains
169 lineage specific Populus repeats and 1018 Rosid
repeats (of which 516 are Arabidopsis specific). There are
additionally 176 ancestral/ubiquitous repeats. There were
extremely few examples of overlap to repeats within the
Rosids dataset with only 212 sRNAs overlapping currently
annotated RepBase repeats. Three of these overlapped to a

Medicago LINE element and the remainder overlapped
with eight annotated LTR elements, five of which were
Populus specific. The contrast between these overlap
results and those of the RepeatModeler data strongly suggest that there is currently a paucity of public data relating
to the repetitive elements in the Populus genome.
To obtain a genomic overview of loci producing siRNAs
we used the UEA plant sRNA toolkit siLoCo tool to identify loci producing significant numbers of siRNAs (Additional File 1). This analysis identified many of the
predicted phased loci (Table 2) and predicted and known
miRNAs. As well as identifying siRNA clusters within the
entire dataset, we used the siLoCo tool using only the 21
nt and 24 nt data subsets separately (Additional File 2 and
3 respectively). In both cases we examined subsets of identified loci with the highest number of unique hits and the
highest raw read count values. The nature of the loci identified was distinctly different between the two size classes:
retrotransposons, and in particular LTR retrotransposons,
accounted for the majority of 24 nt loci. In contrast the
majority of 21 nt loci represented miRNAs and predicted
phased loci. One known miRNA (ptc-mir398c) was
included in the 24 nt loci but in this case the 24 nt
sequence originated within the miRNA* region.
The genomic context of sRNAs was examined by identifying overlap to predicted gene models and repeats. The vast
majority of sRNAs did not overlap gene-coding loci and
most of those that did overlapped with <10 unique
sRNAs. However, a small number of genes overlapped
with a large numbers of sRNAs. For example, the two
genes with the highest overlap to sRNAs were
estExt_Genewise1_v1.C_91780006 (1,646 sRNAs) and
gw1.7267.9.1 (1,351 sRNAs). Nearly all of these overlap-

ping sRNAs map anti-sense to the gene and in both cases
there is a ribosomal DNA (rDNA)-like repeat and an LTR
retrotransposon within the gene coding sequence. In both
cases there was near-equal distribution of sRNAs in all size
classes (18-24 mers) suggesting that these are not siRNAs.
In contrast other genes with high numbers of overlapping
sRNAs showed clear enrichment for a particular size class.
For
example
fgenesh4_pg.C_scaffold_6025000001
showed enrichment for 22 nt and to a lesser extent 24 nt
sRNAs and eugene3.00102261 for 21 nt sRNAs. There
were also cases where there was near-equal distribution
across size classes but with a peak at the smaller sizes (e.g.
gw1.376.2.1 and gw1.422.22.1). In these cases, all reads
derived from the same strand as the gene and therefore
likely represent degradation products of highly expressed
genes. These two genes (and two additional genes in the
list with >100 overlapping sRNAs) encode psbA, with all
four having maximal homology to the Arabidopsis gene
ATCG00020, which also shows a similar pattern of sRNA
overlap. There were 27 genes with >100 unique overlapping sRNAs (Additional File 4) and 2,969 genes overlapped to at least a single mapped sRNAs. Excluding those
genes with >100 overlapping sRNAs, the majority of overlapping sRNAs were 21 mers. Examination of the annotation of the 27 genes with >100 overlapping sRNAs did not
reveal any functional over-representation of Gene Ontology categories or the presence of particular types of genes.
TAS3 targets a subset of the ARF (auxin response factor)
family
Both [31] (Figure 4 of [31]) and [15] have previously
shown conservation across a number of species for both
the TAS3 miR390 target sites and two trans-acting siRNAs
(TAS). TAS3 targeting of a gene coding for an Auxin
Response Factor (ARF3) is important for developmental

timing and patterning in A. thaliana [32]. This is the only
Arabidopsis TAS locus with even limited homology to
Populus as well as being the only A. thaliana TAS with an
Exonerate alignment in the PopGenIE genome browser
[29]. In the current study, the homologous region in Populus produced primarily 21 nt siRNAs (Figure 2D) but was
not one of the predicted phased loci. There were three to
four dominant phasing peaks produced from the locus
(Figure 2D). It is likely that statistical significance for the
ta-siRNA prediction tool was not reached for this region
due to inadequate sequencing depth, most likely resulting
from the locus being weakly expressed: In the Barakat et al.
dataset [22], only two siRNAs from this locus were found.
Examination of the locus in the PopGenIE genome
browser showed that there is a distinct, narrow peak of
sequence conservation between A. thaliana and Populus
shown in the VISTA [33,34] alignment plots that peaks at
the position of the A. thaliana D7(+) TAS3a sequence and
remains high at the D8(+) sequence. There is complete

A

conservation of the D7 and D8 sequences between Arabidopsis and Populus. The D8(+) siRNA sequence has four
perfect hits in the Populus genome. VISTA alignment plots
(available via PopGenIE) show that there is a duplicated
region on LG_VIII (LG_X and LG_VIII are almost exact
duplicates). Despite the high level of conservation
between the duplicated regions, there does not appear to
have been conservation of the siRNA sequences themselves nor of the miR390 target sites. None of the other
perfect hit locations appear to represent duplicated copies
of this locus as only the D8(+) sequence is present at each.
Conservation of TAS3 in rice was reported by [35], suggesting early evolution and strong conservation of this
locus. As was the case in rice, the most abundant siRNA
produced was not the conserved and functional siRNA.
Target prediction for the 21 nt siRNAs from this locus
identified four ARF genes (two ARF3 homologs, an ARF2
homolog and an ARF4 homolog) suggesting that both tar-

get site and target are conserved. Based on our own examination of the ARF family, both ARF2 and ARF3 appear to
be duplicated in Populus, with ARF4 existing as a single
ortholog. In the case of ARF3 we identified two additional
predicted gene models (eugene3.08470003 and
eugene3.150910001) that lie within the same branch of
the phylogenetic tree generated for the entire ARF family
(Additional File 5) but they are truncated and lack the target recognition site for the TAS3a tasiRNA. In the case of
ARF2,
one
of
the
duplicates
(estExt_fgenesh4_pm.C_LG_XII0386) contains three
SNPs within the target site. As one of these SNPs is at the
11th base pair of the target sequence, it is quite probable
that this copy of the gene is no longer targeted. The other
copy (eugene3.00150845) maintains complete homology
to A. thaliana within the target site. It would be interesting
to examine the functional role of this locus in Populus, as
in Arabidopsis it has been shown to control vegetative
phase transition [32]. This is a trait of particular interest in
Populus as the long juvenile phase represents a significant
limitation to breeding programmes. [36] examined the
ARF family in detail and identified six potential ARF2
genes. However only two of these (the two we also identified as duplicated copies) were from the Jamboree gene
model set (v1.1) and as a result the remaining four models that they predicted as ARF2 genes were not included in
the current analysis.
Populus produces many phased siRNAs
In A. thaliana, all TAS loci identified to date produce
phased 21 nt sRNAs, with the phase being set by miRNA
or siRNA cleavage [15,31,37,38]. TAS1 and TAS2 transcripts are targeted by miR173, TAS3 by miR390 and TAS4
by miR828. While miR390 and miR828 are conserved in
Populus, there is no evidence of miR173 conservation. [39]
showed that there appears to be little evidence for the production of phased siRNAs of other lengths in A. thaliana.
The UEA plant sRNA toolkit ta-siRNA tool implements
the algorithm from [39] to identify potential TAS/phased
loci on the basis of such phasing. Using a p value cut-off
of 0.001 (see [39]), 28 potential phased loci were identified containing between three and 14 phased sequences
(Additional File 6). In the case of the predicted phased
locus on LG_X (Table 2) we could extend the predicted
phased locus beyond the region identified (Figure 2A) by
assuming that 'missing' sequences in relation to a predicted miRNA target site were produced but not present in
the current dataset. The production of potentially phased
siRNAs alone is, however, not enough to class a locus as
trans-acting so we concentrated on the 12 predicted highly
significant loci with p values <0.00001 and used the psRNATarget prediction tool [40] to identify potential targets
for phased siRNAs (Table 2, Additional File 6). Seven of
these 12 loci were within predicted protein-coding
regions, five are intergenic and one spans across the end
of a predicted gene model. Of the five loci located in inter-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/620

genic regions, all but one overlapped to NBS-LRR repetitive elements and we therefore do not classify these as TAS
loci. To date, all eight of the confirmed A. thaliana TAS loci
(TAS1a-c, TAS2, TAS3a-c, TAS4) are produced from non
protein-coding regions. Phased loci within coding regions
have also been reported but are not classed as trans-acting
as they typically target in cis or target other members of the
gene family from which they are produced [14,39]. Using
this criterion only the locus at LG_VI:551356..551607
(Table 2, Figure 2B) would be classified as a TAS locus.
Among the identified loci are some interesting examples.
On LG_II (LG_II:14322242..14322493, p 0.000014),
phased sRNAs are produced specifically from the exons of
a predicted No Apical Meristem (NAM) gene
(gw1.II.959.1) with a cluster of sRNAs being produced
from both of the two exons and none from the intervening intron, suggesting that this locus is specific to the transcribed RNA. The loci on LG_III and scaffold_80 contain
phased siRNAs that do not have unique hits within the
genome. In the case of the three loci on LG_III, all three
are homologous and contain largely the same set of siRNAs. From the current study it is not possible to determine
whether all three loci actually produce siRNAs. In the case
of the locus on scaffold_80 there are numerous genomic
hits for each siRNA.
[14] found that Populus PPR-P genes were predicted to be
targeted singularly or dually by either miR475 or miR476.
Our data show that Populus PPR-P loci do produce siRNAs,
with a subset producing phased siRNAs. However, the
gene presented in Figure 5 of [14] (eugene3.00062011)
contains targets sites for both miR475 and miR476 but
did not produce siRNAs in the current study or in that of
[22]. The A. thaliana TAS1 and TAS2 loci specifically target
PPR genes but there is no evidence of homology between
these loci and the ones identified in this study. Therefore
it would seem that similar evolutionary mechanisms have
been deployed to silence the same gene families in both
species. Previously miR475 and miR476 predictions were
based on the considerably smaller datasets of [20,21] and
had not been well characterised.
We found that particularly miR476 has strong sequence
support as a bona fide miRNA. The stem-loop structure and
sRNA read distribution for the four miR475 and three
miR476 loci can been found in Additional File 7 and 8
respectively.
The phased locus on LG_VI generates siRNAs that are predicted to target the MYB transcription factor gene from
which they are generated. Expression of the siRNAs was
low within the sample we sequenced and it is therefore
hard to predict whether such a potential loop of transcriptional regulation has functional significance. TAS4 in A.
thaliana specifically targets MYB transcription factors [16]

however there is no apparent significant homology
between the TAS4 locus and the Populus locus identified
here. However, it is interesting that phasing of TAS4 is set
by miR828 and that there is a miR828 target site in phase
with the locus we have identified.
We also performed a search for predicted genomic target
sites of miR390, miR475, miR476, miR482.2, and
miR828 to examine whether any predicted targets
matched the location of identified phased loci. We
included miR482.2 because it potentially sets the phase of
the locus identified on LG_X:19646453..19647187
(Table 2). However, this did not yield any additional loci
producing sRNAs.
Chromosome XIX contains a sRNA hotspot
The genomic distribution of sRNAs was examined by plotting read counts for each sRNA size class within 0.1 Mb
windows across the entire genome. As has been observed
in A. thaliana [6,16], the location of sRNAs was not evenly
distributed across the genome or along chromosomes.
Three of the 19 chromosomes are shown as examples in
Figure 3 (all 19 chromosomes are displayed in Additional
File 9). In general there was a low-level background production of 24 nt sRNAs with the background punctuated
by regions of significantly higher production. In the
majority of cases, increased sRNA expression was enriched
for a particular size class; for example, about half way
along LG_X and 1/3rd along LG_VII there were distinct 21
nt peaks. In the majority of cases, these peaks represent
highly-expressed miRNAs. There were also regions that
produced high numbers of a combination of size classes,
for example towards the end of LG_I there was a distinct
peak enriched for 21, 22 and 24 nt sRNAs. Specific regions
of chromosomes had considerably higher sRNA production compared to the genome-wide background. In particular, the first third of LG_XIX produced significantly
greater numbers of sRNAs than did the remainder of the
chromosome and the rest of the genome. Interestingly,
this is the same region proposed to be in the process of
developing characteristics associated with a sex chromosome [8,9] and that also has reduced recombination and
enrichment of NBS-LRR disease resistance genes [9].

Using the findings presented in [9], we examined this
region in greater detail. The available genome sequence
for the heterozygous P. trichocarpa female represents only
one haplotype at each location, with each chromosome
sequence representing a chimeric combination of scaffolds from both haplotypes. For the peritelomeric region
of LG_XIX, the alternative haplotype is represented by
scaffold_117 [9], a fact that can be confirmed by examining the presence of the mapped genetic markers ORPM
276 and ORPM 277 (see [9] for details). The two haplotypes for this region are highly divergent, with contrasting
gene content [9]. Of the genes that are in common

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/620

between the two haplotypes, the vast majority are NBSLRR genes. Here we show that only the haplotype represented in LG_XIX contains the identified hotspot for
sRNA production, with sRNA production being minimal
for scaffold_117 (Additional files 10 and 11). The phased
locus identified on LG_XIX is also specific to this haplotype. Target predictions for the phased siRNAs and for
other sRNAs that had unique alignments to this region of
LG_XIX showed almost exclusive targeting of NBS-LRR
genes. Of genes targeted by non-phased sRNAs and
located on linkage groups (interpreting genes on scaffolds
is ambiguous and these are therefore ignored), 26 of 51
genes were located on LG_XIX, 18 of which are located
within the first 1 Mb of the linkage group and all of which
are NBS-LRR genes. Although the majority of genes shared
between the two haplotypes for this region are NBS-LRR
genes, no target sites were identified for genes on
scaffold_117 and examination of paralog data at PopGenIE suggests that the targeted genes are not those with
high similarity to genes on scaffold_117. The notable
over-represented production of sRNAs from this region in
both the 21 and 24 nt size classes and the pattern of NBSLRR gene targeting leaves open the possibility that sRNAs
and NBS-LRR genes within this region have a role to play
in sex determination or the maintenance of reduced
recombination. The observed haplotypic divergence for
these features is certainly intriguing.
Prediction of novel non-conserved miRNAs
Comparison of all siRNA reads to Viridiplantae mature
miRNA sequences in miRBase (Release 13.0) identified
matches to 45 miRNA families (allowing two mismatches
including 5' and 3' overhang, Additional File 12). The
number of matching families increased to 65 when
matches were searched for in the miRNA precursor
sequences. There are currently 43 Populus miRNA families
in miRBase. Perfect matches to 38 of these were identified
when matching to precursor sequences and 34 when
matching to mature miRNAs. Matching to precursor
sequences was performed as we noticed a number of cases
where we sequenced a high copy number 21 nt sequence
that was predicted as a miRNA but did not match the current miRBase mature miRNA entries. As an example, we
identified a sequence matching ptc-miR827 with an
expression count of one. At the corresponding genomic
locus a miRNA was predicted within our dataset but with
the miRNA and miRNA* sequences reversed compared to
the current miRBase entry. In our dataset, the miRNA*
had a read count of 12. A miRNA corresponding to the
current miRBase entry was predicted in [22], in which no
miRNA* sequence was found. This suggests that the two
sequences may be under differential control.

Sequences matching the mature miRNA sequence of two
conserved families (miR1511 and miR858) that do not
currently have Populus mirBase entries were found with

sequence counts of 36 and 17 respectively. Neither of the
regions where these sequences map to were predicted as
miRNAs within our dataset. The sequence matching
miR1511 has 19 perfect hits within the genome and two
hits containing two mismatches. The majority of these
hits are within LTR retrotransposons (based on RepPop
annotations) and none of the locations has evidence of a
miRNA* sequence. This makes it unlikely that any of the
loci represent an actual miRNA, although there is still the
potential that the generated sRNA could serve a targeting
function. The sequences matching miR858 have two perfect hits within the genome. The matching sequence was
also present at a high sequence count (312) in the data of
[22], however no potential miRNA* sequence was found
in either dataset. Neither locus produces a convincing
hairpin structure, making it unlikely that these are actual
miRNAs, despite the perfect homology to mature miRNA
sequences in other plant species. Further work is needed
to determine whether these loci produce siRNAs that
result in target cleavage.
The UEA plant sRNA toolkit miRCat tool identified 414
potential miRNAs (Additional File 13). In A. thaliana,
miRCat has been shown to have >90% sensitivity for
detecting known miRNAs and to have a specificity of
>99% [23] when applied to the comparable dataset of
[16]. Target predictions were run for all predicted miRNAs. All predicted miRNAs matching existing miRBase
entries had predicted targets. Predicted miRNAs matched
143 of the 237 Populus miRNAs currently in miRBase, with
members from 29 of the 43 families included. Of the
remaining sequences, 156 had no predicted targets and
115 had predicted targets. None of the predicted miRNAs
without predicted targets appear to be conserved. Functional enrichment for Gene Ontology (GO [41]) Biological Process categories was carried out for all predicted
targets of existing miRBase miRNAs and for all novel predicted miRNAs from this study. In both cases there was
dramatic and nearly exclusive over-representation of processes associated with development and pattern formation/specification.
Although all of the predicted miRNAs fulfil the requirements of expression and foldback, the need for stringent
annotation criteria has become increasingly evident. [42]
argue that small RNAs that derive from regions apparently
able to form hairpins could very well represent false-positives, and that further evidence such as DCL1 dependency
or detection of a miRNA* is required to classify a locus as
a bona fide miRNA [43]. Since we do not have data on
DCL1 dependency, we used the presence of a miRNA*
sequence as a classification criterion. However, for predicted miRNAs matching existing miRBase entries only 66
of 143 sequences (46%) had a miRNA* sequence present

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/620

in our dataset and the majority of current miRBase entries
have no miRNA* support.
For novel predicted miRNAs with predicted targets, 12 of
115 sequences (10%) had a miRNA* sequence (Table 3,
Additional File 14), and 8 of 156 sequences (5%) with no
predicted targets had a miRNA* sequence. Details of all
predicted miRNAs are given in Additional File 13 and all
secondary structures in Additional File 15.
Within the three classes of data (matching miRBase; notmatching and with predicted targets; not-matching and
no predicted targets) there were distinctly different
sequence length frequencies. The vast majority (76%) of
sequences matching miRBase entries were 21 mers. For
novel miRNAs with predicted targets, the largest size class
was 21 mers (43%), however a notable percentage of 22
mers (12%) and 24 mers (22%) were included. For
sequences with no predicted targets, there was clear overrepresentation of 24 mers (72%), with 21 mers being the
only other notable size group (20%). There were also differences in the frequency of sequences starting with a U,
which is characteristic of the majority of miRNAs in A.
thaliana [16]. For the three classes of predicted miRNAs
the percentage of sequences starting with an A, U, C or G
respectively was: matching miRBase 5, 79, 15, 1; notmatching, with targets 22, 57, 13, 8; not-matching, no targets 32, 40, 17, 12 (Additional file 16). In all three cases
the majority of sequences begin with a U, however the distribution is clearly far more biased towards U in those
sequences matching current miRBase entries. It was also
the case that most cases not matching miRBase but having
an identified miRNA* started with a U. Despite caveats, at
least some of the predicted miRNAs will represent nonconserved, young miRNAs but are certainly expressed at
low levels and would require considerably increased
depth of coverage in order to locate a miRNA* sequence
for which a lack of predicted targets is not unexpected
[44].
We examined the three novel predicted miRNAs with the
highest sequence counts in more detail (Figure 4A-E).
Many of the scaffolds within the current genome assembly
are likely to represent haplotypes rather than unassembled sequences. This is particularly true of the shorter scaffolds. VISTA alignment results suggest that the two loci
represented in Figure 4C-D lie within duplicated regions,
or a least regions that are highly similar and syntenic and
Figure 4G shows that they have highly conserved hairpin
sequences.
Further work will be needed to clarify whether
scaffold_129 represents the other haplotype of the relevant region of LG_XII. Equally, the two miR828 loci rep-

resented in Figure 4A-B likely represents paralogs and
have highly similar hairpin sequences (Figure 4F).
It is likely that several novel miRNA candidates remain to
be found in Populus, and deeper sequencing of small RNA
libraries from additional tissues, in particular flowers, and
conditions is needed. It would, for example, be interesting
to sample material before and after the juvenile phase
transition. The small number of novel non-conserved
miRNAs identified in combination with the evidence that
we obtained considerably greater depth of coverage of the
small RNA population than previous work suggests that
greater depth will now be required to identify miRNAs
with moderate to low abundance due to the requirement
for a sequenced miRNA*. Sequencing sRNAs from additional tissues and conditions will also help clarify which
of the current miRBase ptc-miRNAs can be experimentally
confirmed. As was also reported to be the case in rice [35],
many of the current Populus miRNAs in miRBase lack any
experimental evidence and at least some of the predicted
miRNAs more likely represent siRNAs.
A novel locus may encode dual miRNAs
An additional 24 nt locus (LG_XI:723162..723620, Figure
5A) that lies within a tandemly-duplicated repeat was
located very close to a cluster of unique-hit 21 nt siRNAs,
one of which has an expression count >100, and for which
the siLoCo tool identified a 21 nt loci
(LG_XI:723162..723632). Figure 5B shows the hairpin
structure for this region and the position of sequenced
siRNAs along the hairpin. Evidence for a dual production
from transposable elements has been previously reported
[45] and production of 21 nt sRNAs from hairpin-like
structures has been observed in A. thaliana [1], where it
was suggested that these may represent recently evolved,

or still evolving, miRNAs. The potential mature miRNA
sequence shows no similarity to any current entries in
miRBase and none of the sequences lie in regions showing
evidence of cross-species conservation (Figure 5A). The
potential 21 nt miRNA had a detectable miRNA*
sequence (Figure 5) and there was also a potential
miRNA* for the most highly-expressed 24 nt sRNA. Several variants that differ by one base on either side of this
sequence were also highly expressed. It is possible that
this hairpin produces two mature miRNAs through different cleavage reactions, or that the 21 nt and 24 nt
sequences represent different classes of sRNAs. The hairpin structure for this genomic region results from the high
degree of complementarity between a pair of annotated
repeats (Figure 5A). The 21 nt potential miRNA has two
predicted NBS-LRR targets, both of which are on
scaffold_44
(eugene3.00440201
and
fgenesh4_pg.C_scaffold_44000194). Viewing the Exonerate alignments of Populus proteins for the gene model
available at PopGenIE showed that none of the aligned
paralogous sequences contain repeats in the same exon
and correspondingly none contain any mapped sRNAs.
miRNA targeting in duplicated genes
Since the Populus genome has undergone a relatively
recent whole-genome duplication, we were interested in
how many pairs of duplicated genes had retained miRNA
targeting in both copies. Using psRNATarget predictions
of miRNA targeting for all miRBase miRNAs (Release
13.0) in combination with data made available on the JGI
Populus genome ftp site [46], an analysis of recent duplicated genes was used to identify those duplets (duplicated
gene pairs) where only one of the two copies is predicted
to be targeted by a miRNA. Across all of the 45,555 predicted Populus gene models, 167 (≈ 0.4%) were predicted

to be targeted by a miRNA. The duplicated dataset contains 6,699 duplicated gene pairs of which the vast majority (6,663) are not predicted to be targeted by miRNAs. Of
the 36 duplets remaining (≈ 0.5%) there were 21 where
both duplets are predicted to be targeted by miRNAs and
15 where only one of the two duplet copies is targeted.
Alignments of these showed that six duplets lost target
predictions due to gene models being highly truncated
compared to the other copy with the target site entirely
missing. There were SNPs or single base pair insertions in
seven cases but none of these were at the 10th or 11th
position and so target predictions were lost because the
threshold score we set (2) was not met. In these cases it is
not clear whether the duplet would still be targeted or not.
There was one example of an insertion and one of a deletion that did affect the 10th and 11th position of the target
site, which would almost certainly result in a loss of
miRNA binding.

Conclusions
We profiled the sRNA population in Populus to a depth far
exceeding previous efforts. This allowed identification of
novel, non-conserved miRNA loci, phased siRNAs and
characterisation of the genomic distribution of sRNAs. We
identified a region of LG_XIX overlapping the sex determination region and a major cluster NBS-LRR genes as a hotspot for sRNA production Whether or not sRNAs are more
important regulators of developmental transitions in
long-lived species such as Populus compared to annual
species remains to be established.

Young, but fully expanded, leaves from Populus trichocarpa
'Nisqually-1' trees of ≈ 1.5 metres grown in pots in the
Umeå University greenhouses under natural light regime

Figure 5
Potential non-conserved miRNA
Potential non-conserved miRNA. A Genomic context of a locus enriched in 21 and 24 nt sRNAs on LG_XI between base
pairs 723162..723632. B Hairpin structure of the region marked as a red bar in A including the location of potential 21 and 24
nt miRNA and miRNA*sequences. Sequence counts for sRNAs mapping to the hairpin are indicated by colour of shading (blue
through to red). The two regions shown in detail indicate predicted miRNA and miRNA* sequences (marked as grey lines)
with the corresponding sequence counts shown. Each coloured circle within the hairpin represents one base pair.

ment and RNA cloning of RNAs in the 18 to 24-nts size
range was performed as previously described [18] with the
following modifications: The 3' adapter (Linker1, CTGTAGGCACCATCAAT) was 5'-adenylated and 3'-dedioxymodified (IDT) and the 5' adapter (Acceptor1,
atcgtAGGCACCUGAUA, lower case is DNA, upper case is
RNA) was chimeric (IDT). The primer for reverse transcription was ATTGATGGTGCCTACAG (IDT). Re-suspension of first-strand cDNA was carried out in 20 l 0.1 × TE.

FusionB1
(GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGATTGATGGTGCCTACAG). The amplification product was precipitated
using 70% ethanol in the presence of 20 g glycogen
(Ambion), washed once in 500 l ice-cold 70% ethanol
and re-suspended in 20 l of nuclease-free water (Qiagen).
The purified product was subjected to emulsion Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and massively parallel pyrosequencing on 1/16th of a plate in a GS-FLX instrument
following the manufacturer's instructions (Roche).

Pilot experiment
After first-strand cDNA synthesis, amplification was carried out in a 20- l reaction using 2 U of phusion polymerase (New England Biolabs), 5 l first-strand cDNA and 5
pmol each of the primers FusionA1 (GCCTCCCTCGCGCCATCAGATCGTAGGCACCTGATA)
and

Concatenation experiment
After first-strand cDNA synthesis, six parallel amplification reactions were carried out using 1 l of cDNA template per reaction 5'-monophosphorylated primers. After
pooling, nucleic acids were purified using ethanol precipitation as described above. Two 20- l concatenation reac-

tions were set up, each containing 5 l purified
amplification product, 4 l 5 × T4 DNA Ligase buffer, 1 l
T4 DNA Ligase (High concentration, Invitrogen) and 10 l
sterile deionized water. The reactions were incubated for 3
hours at room temperature (≈ 20°C). Concatenated DNA
was ethanol precipitated as described above, and subjected to ligation of sequencing adapters according to the
manufacturer's instructions (Roche). After emulsion PCR,
sequencing on a GS-FLX was carried out following the
manufacturer's instructions (Roche).
To extract the small RNA sequences from the data we
matched tags of the 10 last and 10 first bases of the 5'- and
3'-tags respectively and extracted the sequence between
them. After initial tag searching on the sequenced strand,
all reads were converted to their reverse complement and
the tag searching was repeated. This was done since the
blunt concatenation can take place in any direction (as
shown in Figure 1A).
Data processing
All data filtering and analysis was performed using the
UEA plant sRNA toolkit [23]. This is an sRNA analysis
pipeline for second-generation sequencing data analysis
and implements a number of algorithms based on knowledge obtained primarily from sRNA studies in A. thaliana.
Sequences were filtered to only include 18-24 nt entries,
to remove known r/tRNAs and low complexity sequences
and to keep only those with perfect matches to the published P. trichocarpa genome sequence [12]. The
sequenced P. trichocarpa clone is the same one used for the
current study.

The overlap between sRNAs and genomic features was
examined using the data provided at the PopGenIE web
resource [29]. All sRNA sequences have been deposited at
the PopGenIE web-resource [29] and can be viewed
within the main genome browser.
Phased siRNA and siRNA loci detection
The redundant sequence data was used as input for the
siLoCo and ta-siRNA prediction tools. For these tools, all
options were left at their defaults. A p value of 0.001 was
used for the ta-siRNA prediction tool. The output from the
ta-siRNA prediction tool was visualised at PopGenIE and
loci with p values <10-5 were manually inspected to identify whether the loci could be further extended by allowing for sequences missed due to low expression/lack of
sequencing depth.
miRNA prediction
The miRCat tool was used to identify putative miRNA
sequences using the redundant filtered sequence data. A
minimum sRNA abundance of 2 was set with a maximum
of 16 genomic hits and a size-range of 18-24. This tool

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/620

also generates a GFF-format file containing details of all
predicted miRNAs and non-miRNA sequences. This file
was uploaded to the PopGenIE web resource for visualisation. Matches to existing, known Populus miRNAs (miRBase Release 13.0 [25]) were identified using PatMan [48].
Two searches were run to identify matches to mature miRNAs, one allowing 2 mismatches and another allowing
two gaps. The second was used to allow overhang at the
beginning or the end of the miRNA sequence as in many
cases, we identified a 21 nt sequence for predicted miRNAs where the current miRBase entry is shorter. No gaps
within the mature sequence were allowed. We also
searched for matches using the predicted hairpin
sequence to miRBase hairpin sequences as there were
cases where the predicted mature miRNA represented the
currently deposited miRNA* sequence.
Target prediction
miRNA target predictions were performed for all current
P. trichocarpa miRNAs in miRBase (Release 13.0) in addition to novel predicted miRNAs and TAS siRNAs from this
study. We compared target predictions made using the
UEA plant sRNA toolkit target prediction tool, the WMD2
target search tool (Web miRNA Designer [49]), the TargetFinder tool from the Carrington lab [13,31] and the psRNATarget tool available at [40]. For psRNATarget the
maximum expectation was set to two and all other
options left as default. The psRNATarget tool reports all
potential complementary regions between miRNA/tasiRNA and target sequences using an improved iterative
parallel Smith-Waterman algorithm and a weighted scoring schema allowing each mismatch to be weighted
according to the mismatch type and position in the query
small RNA (cf [40]). We found that there was near-complete overlap between the psRNATarget predictions and
those from TargetFinder and the UEA toolkit tool but with
fewer predicted targets using the maximum expectation
values of two. As this likely represents a situation of having some false-negatives but few false-positives, we
decided to use the psRNATarget tool. There was also
extensive overlap between the predictions from the TargetFinder and UEA target search tool with less overlap
between prediction from the WMD2 target search tool on
average (data not shown).

Target predictions for miRBase (Release 13.0) sequences
from all tools have been made available at the PopGenIE
ftp site and are already included in the genome browser.
Potential genomic target sites (i.e. not within the coding
sequence of gene models) were identified using PatMan
by searching for complementary matches with up to 2
mismatches or by using the psRNATarget tool to search
for targets within over-lapping 3.4 Kb genomic regions.
Although likely to exclude a number of bona fide targets,

Page 14 of 18
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:620

we used a maximum expectation value threshold of two in
order to minimise false-positives.
Repeat Masking
We performed both repeat masking of repeats in RepBase
[30] using RepeatMasker [50] as well as performing de
novo repeat identification using the RepeatModeler pipeline [51]. RepeatModeler uses RECON [52], RepeatScout
[53] and Tandem Repeat Finder [54] to perform de novo
repeat identification. The consensus repeat library generated by RepeatModeler was then used with RepeatMasker.
The data contained in the RepPop database [55] were also
used. All repeat runs performed have been made available
at the PopGenIE web resource and can be visualised in the
genome browser or downloaded from the ftp site.
Comparison to previous data
In order to be able to directly compare our data to that of
[22], we downloaded their supplementary data and created a redundant sequence file to use as input to the UEA
plant sRNA toolkit. This was then used to perform exactly
the same analysis as described for our dataset. Comparisons to the Barakat data are therefore based on the results
from the UEA plant sRNA toolkit tools rather than the
results presented in the text of [22].

All files produced by the UEA plant sRNA toolkit tools for
both our data and that of [22] are available for download
from the PopGenIE ftp site.
