Clinical severity of Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP)
infection is associated with bacterial load in
oropharyngeal secretions but not with MP
genotype

Abstract
Background: Disease severity in Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) infection could potentially be related to bacterial
factors such as MP genotype (MP1 or MP2; distinguished by different adhesions proteins) or bacterial load in
airway secretions. We have compared these parameters in patients who were hospitalized for MP pneumonia, with
outpatients with mild MP disease.
Methods: MP bacterial load was measured by real-time PCR in 45 in- and outpatients ("clinical study group”) in
whom MP DNA had been detected in oropharyngeal secretions by PCR. In addition, genotype and phylogenetic
relationships were determined. The phylogenetical assessment was done by partial DNA sequencing of the P1
gene on isolates from 33 patients in the clinical study-group where sufficient DNA was available. The assessment
was further extended to isolates from 13 MP-positive family members and 37 unselected MP positive patients from
the two subsequent years and two different geographical locations. In total 83 strains were molecular
characterized.
Results: Mean MP loads were significantly higher in 24 hospitalized patients than in 21 outpatients (1600 vs. 170
genomic equivalents/μL, p = 0.009). This difference remained significant after adjustment for age and days
between disease onset and sampling. Hospitalized patients also had higher C-reactive protein levels. Mean levels
were 188 vs 20 mg/L (p = 0,001). The genotype assessment showed MP genotype 1 in 17 of the 33 sequenced
strains from the clinical study-group, and type 2 in 16 of these patients. Within each genotype, sequence
differences were minimal. No association between disease severity and MP genotype was observed. In the
extended genotype assessment, MP1 was found in similar proportions. In family contacts it was found in 53% and
among patients from the two subsequent years 53% and 40%.
Conclusions: A higher MP bacterial load in throat secretions at diagnosis was associated with more advanced
respiratory disease in patients, but MP genotype did not influence disease severity. Both MP genotypes
co-circulated during recent outbreaks in Sweden.

Background
Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) is a major respiratory
pathogen that can cause clinical disease ranging from
mild upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) to severe,
occasionally fatal pneumonia. MP infection may also
lead to several extra-pulmonary conditions, such as

myocarditis, meningoencephalitis and hemolytic anemia
[1,2]. Previously, the only available method for diagnosing MP infection in clinical practice was serology, permitting a diagnosis no earlier than one to two weeks
after disease onset when antibodies have developed. We
have recently presented data showing that nucleic acid
amplification tests (NAATs) on throat secretions have
superior sensitivity to serology during the early phase of
MP disease [3]. In addition, we found that the average

MP load continuously declined after disease onset.
Eventually all patients became negative (in their throatsamples) for MP DNA. Half of the patients had become
negative after 54 days; however, one patient carried MP
for 7 months.
Infectious disease manifestations may be explained by
both host- and pathogen-related factors. For MP, correlates of disease severity are incompletely known. An
association between the load of MP DNA and clinical
severity was demonstrated in one report of ten patients,
showing a higher level of bacterial genome equivalents
in cases with a more severe clinical course [4] however,
the results were not adjusted for age and interval
between disease onset and sampling.
MP can be categorized into two genotypes, MP1 and
MP2, based on the DNA sequence of the P1 adhesion
protein, which is located in the cell membrane and is of
vital importance for bacterial adhesion to epithelial cells
[5-10]. Previous studies have suggested that these two
genotypes may co-circulate during an MP outbreak [11].
Whether the clinical manifestations differ for the two
MP genotypes is not known.
This study aims to determine whether MP bacterial
load and genotype are associated with disease severity,
to characterize oropharyngeal isolates of MP obtained
during an outbreak in 2005-2006 in an urban area of
Southern Sweden, and to compare these results with
clinical data. In addition, the MP genotype distribution
during this and other recent outbreaks in Southern Sweden was investigated and strain differences assessed
phylogenetically.

Methods
Study population
2005-2006 outbreak patients (clinical study group)

All 45 MP PCR positive individuals identified in a previous study, which compared serology and MP PCR in
oropharyngeal secretions for the early diagnosis of MP
infection [3], were included. These patients, consisting
of 24 hospitalized patients and 21 outpatients, are henceforth referred to as the “clinical study group”. These
patients, all with respiratory tract infection suggesting
MP infection were recruited from the Department of
Infectious Diseases at Malmö University Hospital (serving Malmö city with suburban areas in southern Sweden with 360 000 inhabitants) and from four primary
health care centres in Malmö city during the winter season 2005-2006 (September 20 - March 15; when rates of
detected MP infections were high).
All 45 patients had their initial PCR test confirmed at
least once by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). They
underwent consecutive PCR testing on serial samples
until 2 consecutive PCR negative samples were obtained.
Clinical data were obtained at the first visit to the health

Page 2 of 8

care provider when MP infection was suspected. In
some cases patients had already been unsuccessfully
treated with betalactam antibiotics at that time. Information was regularly collected during the course of the
disease and after resolution of symptoms, using medical
records, interviews and questionnaires [3].
Levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) were analysed at
first visit in 37 of the patients (20 inpatients and 17 outpatients). All CRP-results were obtained by analysing
plasma samples on a Beckham Synchron LX20 (Beckham Coulter, Inc. Fullerton, CA, USA) at the Laboratory
of Clinical Chemistry at Malmö University Hospital.
Family contacts

Household members of ten MP patients in the study
were offered MP testing to estimate MP transmission.
Eighteen of 22 subjects tested were MP PCR positive, all
with ongoing or recent symptoms of URTI. At least one
MP positive family member was found in all households
screened.
None of the family contacts had sought health-care on
their own initiative. They underwent no physical examination nor had their CRP levels determined but were
followed by repeated PCR testing and self reported
symptoms in the same manner as the patients in the
clinical study group. During follow-up, all of the family
contacts became PCR negative. Strains from the family
contacts were only included in the assessment of genotype distribution and genetic conformity, not in the MP
load evaluation.
MP strains collected during other seasons

For epidemiological strain comparison, MP isolates from
patients from two other seasons and locations were also
DNA sequenced and genotyped. These included strains
from 20 unselected patients diagnosed with MP infection by PCR in Malmö during the winter season of
2007-2008 and 17 MP isolates obtained from patients
during the latter half of the outbreak 2006-2007 in
Göteborg, (250 km north of Malmö). These strains were
only included in the assessment of genotype distribution
and genetic conformity, not in the MP load evaluation.
Sampling procedure

A cotton-tipped swab was used to obtain throat samples
from the posterior wall in the oropharynx. These samples were transferred to tubes containing 1 mL phosphate buffered saline.
Written informed consent was obtained from all participants, and the study had been approved by the Lund
University ethical committee.
Laboratory methods
DNA extraction

DNA was extracted from the samples by the MagNa
Pure LC Instrument using the MagNa Pure LC DNA

Nilsson et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2010, 10:39
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/10/39

Isolation kit I (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim,
Germany). Nucleic acid from 200 μL of the sample was
finally obtained in 75 μL elution buffer.
Quantitative PCR

A quantitative real-time Taqman PCR method was
applied as described elsewhere [3] with primers 435
(5’-GGCAGTCAACAAACCACGTATG-3’) and 479
(5’-GGTGGTTGATGCGGTCAAA-3’) together with the
probe (FAM-5’-TCGCGTTCCTTTCTCCCGACGTTTT-3’-TAMRA). As a standard for quantification the
PCR amplification fragment using the primers above was
cloned into a plasmid using the pUC system followed by
transfection of a carrier E. coli. The plasmid with its
cloned fragment was then purified using the QIAprep
Miniprep kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), quantified spectrophotometrically and then included in tenfold serial
dilutions as a reference curve for quantitative measurements of MP in clinical samples.
DNA sequencing

Thirty-three (17 inpatients and 16 outpatients) of the 45
MP positive samples from Malmö patients and 13 of
the 18 family members were typed by sequencing a
fragment of the gene coding for the P1 adhesion protein
as described by Kong et al. [10], after being amplified
with nested PCR. Sequencing could not be done in the
remaining samples due to lack of DNA material. For
the outer PCR the primers were P1-178 (5’-CAATGCCATCAACCCGCG-3’) and MPAW1 (5’-GCGCGCATAAGGCGCATC-3’). The inner PCR utilized primers
MPSW2 (5’-GTGAAACGAGGTCAAAAA-3’) and
MPAW (5’-ATAAGGCGCATCGTACAG-3’). The latter
pair was also used as sequencing primers. The amplification products for MP1 were 606 bp and for MP2 621
bp. They were purified and sequenced using an ABI
cycle sequencing system (BigDye, ABI).
Phylogenetic analysis

Complementary sequences for each isolate, with primer
sequences removed, were edited by the ABI softwares
Factura and Sequence Navigator and transferred in
FASTA format to BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor
(version 7.01, Tom Hall, Dept of Microbiology, North
Carolina University, USA). Alignment was conducted
with Clustal via the putative translated amino acids, and
then translated back to DNA sequences to maintain
codon integrity. Alignment induced gaps were subsequently handled as pair-wise deletions in the phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses using MEGA
version 3.1. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using
the Neighbour-Joining method. The substitution algorithm was based on p-distances calculated by the
Kimura 2-parameter method. Reference sequences were
from prototype genotype 1, -M 129 - (GenBank; accession number U00089) and type 2, -TW 7-5/FH [12].

Statistical analysis

Patients of the 2005-2006 season where divided into two
groups; those hospitalized (with more severe illness) and
those treated as out-patients (milder illness) and statistical evaluations of MP load in baseline samples and genotype distribution were based on this classification.
Differences in MP load and mean values of CRP were
assessed by Student’s t-test and the non-parametric
Mann-Whitney U-test. Logistic regression was used to
adjust for age and interval between disease onset and
sampling. Differences in proportions of genotype were
analysed by the Chi-square test.
The Statistica package (StatSoft, Tulsa, OK, USA) and
the R-package (Vienna, Austria) were used.

Results
Patient characteristics

Characteristics of the 45 patients from the 2005-2006
outbreak are presented in Table 1. Twenty-four patients
had been admitted to the hospital as inpatients and 21
were treated as outpatients. Inpatients were admitted for
a median of 7 days (range: 1-21). Their median age was
37 years (range: 2-79), compared to 33 years for outpatients (range: 9-55). Among the hospitalized patients, 15/
24 had peripheral oxygen saturation below 90%, and
were thus given oxygen therapy. However, no patient
required ventilatory support or intensive care.
Hospitalized patients were slightly older than outpatients, and the proportion of women was higher (75%
vs. 54%). Six patients had underlying chronic diseases
(5 inpatients and 1 outpatient), but no patient had significant immunosuppression. Median number of days
between disease onset and initial sampling for MP was
13 days (range: 1-95). For inpatients median number
of days was 10 (range 3-33) and for outpatients 17
(range 1-95).
According to the study design, MP sampling was done
when a clinical suspicion of MP infection arose, often
after clinical failure of betalactam antibiotics for the
treatment of community-acquired pneumonia.
All 24 hospitalized patients had received betalactam
antibiotic therapy prior to MP diagnosis, compared to
8/21 outpatients. A greater proportion of hospitalized
patients (23/24 vs 2/21) had undergone chest X-ray,
which showed pulmonary infiltrates compatible with
pneumonia in 23 cases; however, such infiltrates were
also observed in the two outpatients who underwent
chest X-ray. Current smoking was self-reported for 1/24
hospitalized patient, 0/21 outpatients and 3/18 family
contacts.
Mean baseline CRP levels were significantly higher in
inpatients than outpatients, 188 vs. 20 mg/L (p < 0.001)
using Mann-Whitney U-test; p < 0.003 using Student’s
t-test. (Table 1).

Disease severity
Bacterial load and disease severity

Among the 24 inpatients the geometric mean number of
genomic equivalents in the diagnostic MP sample was
1600 (range: 14-570 000) DNA equivalents/μL throat
secretion compared to 170 (range 7 - 5 400) DNA
equivalents/μL throat secretion among the 21 outpatients (p = 0,009 using the Student’s t-test and p = 0.039
using the Mann-Whitney U test). Differences in bacterial load at diagnosis remained statistically significant
after adjustment for age and time between onset of
symptom and sampling in a logistic regression model.
(Table 2).
Genotype and disease severity

Genotype MP1 or MP2 was determined for strains
from 33 patients where MP-DNA was available. Chromatograms did not indicate any mixed MP infections.
The proportion of patients infected with MP1 was
slightly higher among those with more severe illness,
58% (11/19) compared to patients with milder disease,
43% (6/14) but the difference was not statistically significant (c2 = 0.25, p = 0.62).
Genotype and bacterial load

Geometric mean number of genomic equivalents was
560 DNA equivalents/μL for MP1 and 400 DNA equivalents/μL for MP2. The difference was not statistically
significant (p = 0,67).
Genotype distribution

In the clinical study group from the community outbreak in Malmö 2005-2006 MP1 was found in 52% (17/
33) of the patients. During the winter season 2007-2008

in Malmö 40% (8/20) of the cases had MP1. In Göteborg, studied during the 2006-2007 season 47% (8/17)
of the strains were MP1 (Figure 1).
Genotype concordance in family contacts

MP was detected in throat swabs from 18 of 22 tested
family members in 10 families. Sequencing was successful in 13 of these family cases. In all 7 families, where
more than one individual had sequenced samples all
strains had the same MP genotype (MP1 in 7 family
contacts from 5 families and MP2 in 5 family contacts
from 2 families). In one additional family member MP2
was detected but the index case isolate could not be
sequenced. The partial adhesion P1 gene sequences
within each investigated family were identical.
Genetic conformity

The P1 sequences were strikingly similar within each
genotype and 38 of 40 MP1 isolates were identical in
the amplified region whereas two showed a silent
mutation. Likewise, the MP2 strains were highly similar. One common point mutation at position 976
codon 325 of the P1 gene was found in 21 of the 43
MP2 isolates leading to a change from valine to isoleucin and in one of these 21 strains an additional mutation leading to a change from threonine to alanine was
found. Also in the other MP2 lineage with valine at
codon 325 a coupled AC to TG mutation induced a
change from threonine to cysteine. These minor point
mutations were not confined to any single season or
geographical site as shown by the phylogenetic tree
(figure 2).

Discussion
The factors determining disease manifestations and
severity in MP infection are only partly understood.
Comparing patients with mild and more severe MP
respiratory infection, we found that patients in need of
hospitalization had higher MP load in throat secretions
than outpatients. This difference remained statistically
significant after adjustment for age and interval between

disease onset and sampling. Both MP genotype 1 and 2
were detected in similar proportions during the different
outbreaks. Genotype identity was neither associated with
disease severity nor bacterial load.
Higher MP load in hospitalized patients than in outpatients has previously been reported by DorigmoZetsma et al [4] in ten patients; however, no statistical
adjustment was done with regard to age and disease

Nilsson et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2010, 10:39
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/10/39

duration at sampling which is important as the pathogen
load continuously declines with time after onset of disease [3].
Both age and time between disease onset and sampling were adjusted for in our calculations confirming
the association between bacterial load and disease severity. This suggests that the pathogenesis of MP is mainly
due to direct bacterial factors, a hypothesis that is supported by the finding of a higher risk of severe MP disease in patients for whom adequate antibiotic therapy
had been delayed [13].
However, the existence of such an association does
not exclude that immune-mediated mechanisms might
also be involved in pathogenesis. In patients with high
MP loads, elevated amounts of antigen could trigger a
more prominent inflammatory response. This may
explain why patients with severe MP pneumonia appear
to benefit from corticosteroids given in addition to
appropriate antibiotic treatment [14,15]. Furthermore,
improved resolution of pulmonary lesions in MPinfected mice having received a combination of macrolide antibiotics and corticosteroids compared to those
who only received antibiotics have been found, lending
further support to this association [16].
Different scoring methods have been used to determine the severity of pneumonia. We used hospital
admission as a marker of more severe illness. Several
factors apart from the severity of the acute infection
may influence the need of hospitalisation, such as age,
social situation and underlying diseases. In the statistical
analysis, however, we have controlled for the influence
of age. None of the included patients had multiple coexisting diseases, and in fact the majority were previously healthy and of young middle age. Only one hospital was involved in the study of clinical severity,
making a bias in admission policy unlikely.
CRP levels were significantly higher in admitted
patients (188 mg/L vs. 20 mg/L), further supporting our
grouping of patients since CRP levels have been shown
to predict severity of pneumonia [17-19].
Among our hospitalized MP patients, all 23 who
underwent x-ray had pulmonary infiltrates consistent
with pneumonia. The true proportion of outpatients
with pulmonary infiltrates is unknown since only two of
them had symptoms justifying x-ray.
It has been suggested that MP may be a commensal of
the respiratory tract mucosa; thus, the identification of
MP among outpatients with URTI could reflect colonization rather than invasive infection [20]. However, in
our previous study using the same PCR method, we
found a low rate of MP carriage (0.4%) among 237 children healthy enough to be in school during a season
with high rates of MP cases [3]. The single child diagnosed with MP in that population study was found to

Page 6 of 8

have typical symptoms with persistent cough and fever.
Our findings in school children are in agreement with
those reported by Kumar et al who did not detect MP
by multiplex PCR in any nasopharyngeal swab from 129
asymptomatic children and adults [21]. Taken together,
this indicates that detection of MP DNA in a patient
with URTI is likely to signify symptomatic infection.
Several factors could contribute to the differences in
MP load observed between patients. Immunosuppression and smoking [22,23] have been associated with
higher MP load, but both these factors were rare among
our patients. Partial immunity from prior MP infections
might also explain the different bacterial loads [24]. In
an outbreak in Israel, smoking and low pre-existing MP
antibody levels were associated with an increased risk of
symptomatic MP infection [23], suggesting that preexisting antibody levels may affect the disease course.
In contrast to our observed association between bacterial load and clinical severity, no such association was
found between genotype and clinical severity. Both MP1
and MP2 had similar distribution with regard to clinical
severity.
In Japan, Kenri et al [11] found a gradual type shift of
the most prevalent MP subtype during the period 19952005 from MP2 to MP1 in 127 clinical isolates obtained
in three separate areas. Similar shifts of predominant
type over time have been reported from Germany;
France and Denmark [25]. In our study, covering a
much shorter time span both genotypes were detected
during each season and in two geographical locations.
Although immunological pressure may favour shifts of
MP genotype, a co-circulation of MP genotypes appears
to be common.
With the very restricted phylogenetic differences
found within each subtype, the chosen gene product
was too conserved to allow for analysis of transmission
chains. Genotype and exact sequence conservation was
however observed within each investigated family. To
our knowledge genome conformity of MP has not been
studied before.
Our study has some limitations. Most patients were
recruited from a department of infectious diseases at a
university hospital, which may have led to a disproportionate number of cases with more severe MP infection.
Most patients in our study were young middle-aged
adults. Therefore, our findings may not be applicable to
children, who often constitute the majority of MP cases
during outbreaks. Few participants in this study had
severe underlying diseases or were smokers. This could
reflect a selection bias in sampling. However, in the prevalence study from which the participants in this study
were recruited [3], MP sampling was performed on a
broad range of patients with pulmonary infections and
underlying conditions, suggesting that MP infection is

Nilsson et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2010, 10:39
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/10/39

not a common pathogen in immunosuppressed subjects.
All of the hospitalized patients and 40% of the outpatients had received betalactam antibiotic therapy prior to
the MP diagnosis, but since MP lacks a cell wall, on
which betalactam antibiotics exercise their effect, it is
improbable that this treatment has influenced our
results.
Throat swabs were used to obtain samples, and the
same technique was used for hospitalized subjects, outpatients and family contacts. The amount of throat
secretion absorbed by the swab before dilution in 1 mL
of buffered saline could not be determined, making
standardization of samples difficult. Housekeeping genes
such as beta-globin maybe useful to standardize results
from throat swabs. This is important when intracellular
agents such as viruses are looked for but may be less
useful in the case of MP which is a superficial infection
of the mucous membranes.
Since sampling of patients and family members was
done in few sites by a limited number of trained staff,
sampling problems are unlikely to explain the observed
10-fold differences in bacterial load.

Conclusions
This study demonstrated a statistically significant association between clinical disease severity and bacterial
load in patients with MP infection also after adjustment
for age and interval between onset of symptoms to sampling by a logistic regression analysis. This finding suggests that direct bacterial factors are important in MP
pathogenesis. MP genotype, however, was not related to
disease severity indicating that both genotypes have
similar pathogenic potential. During three consecutive
winter seasons, two separate highly conserved MP genotypes co-circulated in similar proportions.
