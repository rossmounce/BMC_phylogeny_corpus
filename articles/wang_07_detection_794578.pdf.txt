Abstract

information

Conclusion: We have demonstrated that intra-primate sequence comparisons can be used to
identify functional modules in large genomic regions, including cis-regulatory elements that are not
detectable through comparison with non-mammalian genomes. With the available human and
rhesus genomes and that of marmoset, which is being actively sequenced, this strategy can be
extended to the whole genome in the near future.

interactions

Results: To evaluate a strategy for large scale genome annotation that is complementary to the
commonly used distal species comparisons, we explored the potential of deep intra-primate
sequence comparisons. We sequenced the orthologs of 558 kb of human genomic sequence,
covering multiple loci involved in cholesterol homeostasis, in 6 non-human primates. Our analysis
identified six non-coding DNA elements displaying significant conservation among primates but
undetectable in more distant comparisons. In vitro and in vivo tests revealed that at least three of
these six elements have regulatory function. Notably, the mouse orthologs of these three
functional human sequences had regulatory activity despite their lack of significant sequence
conservation, indicating that they are ancestral mammalian cis-regulatory elements. These
regulatory elements could be detected even in a smaller set of three primate species including
human, rhesus and marmoset.

Background: Genomic comparisons between human and distant, non-primate mammals are
commonly used to identify cis-regulatory elements based on constrained sequence evolution.
However, these methods fail to detect functional elements that are too weakly conserved among
mammals to distinguish them from non-functional DNA.

Background

Identifying cis-regulatory elements in the human genome,
such as promoters and enhancers that regulate gene expression in normal and diseased cells and tissues, is a major challenge of the post-genomic era. Inter-species sequence
comparisons have emerged as a major technique for identifying human regulatory elements, particularly those to the
sequenced mouse, chicken and fish genomes [1]. However, a
significant fraction of empirically defined human regulatory
modules are too weakly conserved in other mammalian
genomes, such as the mouse, to distinguish them from nonfunctional DNA [2], and are completely undetectable in nonmammalian genomes [3,4]. Identification of such significantly divergent functional sequences will require complementary methods in order to complete the functional
annotation of the human genome.
Deep intra-primate sequence comparison, referred to as 'phylogenetic shadowing', is a novel alternative to the commonly
used distant species comparisons [5]. However, primate
shadowing has so far only been applied to the identification of
novel cis-regulatory elements in short, targeted genomic fragments (≤ 2.0 kb) [6,7], due to the lack of sequence data from
multiple primates. Thus, it remains to be determined if this
approach is useful in identifying otherwise undetectable regulatory regions in unbiased scans of large genomic loci. Perhaps for this reason, primate shadowing has been almost
entirely overlooked as a predictor of regulatory elements.
Here we evaluate the possibility of using deep primate
sequence comparisons in large genomic regions (approximately 100 kb) to systematically uncover cis-regulatory elements that are undetectable through mammalian or more
distant comparisons. We focused on genes involved in cholesterol metabolism, since this is a physiological process marked
by numerous differences between human and distant mammals. In particular, differential regulation of LXRα and its
target genes is thought to contribute to inter-species variation
in the plasma cholesterol response to dietary cholesterol
intake [8]. We evaluated the sensitivity and true positive rate
of primate shadowing using as a test set known functional
sequences in eight loci, for which we sequenced a phylogenetically representative panel of primate species. Using a combination of close and distant species comparisons, we then
identified six human sequences characterized by primatespecific conservation in these eight gene loci, and tested them
for enhancer function in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we determined if a subset of primate sequences comprising genomes
currently available or being sequenced would suffice to identify divergent mammalian regulatory sequences.

Results
Primate comparison identifies known functional
sequences in large genomic intervals
To test the power of primate shadowing to identify functional
elements in large genomic intervals, we sequenced the primate orthologs of eight human loci containing LXRα and
eight of its target genes: SREBF1, CYP7A1, LDLR, ABCG5,
ABCG8, APOE cluster, APOCIII cluster, and HMGCR. The
sequenced species comprised six anthropoid primates
(baboon, colobus, dusky titi, marmoset, owl monkey and
squirrel monkey) and one prosimian (lemur). The targeted
genomic segments included all exons, introns and flanking
intergenic regions of the above mentioned genes, encompassing 558 Kb of human genomic DNA.
We identified sequences evolutionarily conserved among
seven anthropoid primates (the six targeted anthropoids plus
human) or among all eight primates (anthropoid plus lemur)
using Gumby, an algorithm that detects sequence blocks
evolving significantly more slowly than the local neutral rate
[3,9,10]. Most of the conserved regions overlapped exons
(see, for example, Figure 1). The true-positive rate, defined as
the fraction of conserved regions overlapping exons or known
regulatory regions, was 80% in the 7-primate comparison
(Figure 2a) and 81% using the 8-primate set (data not
shown). The human-dog comparison, which approximately
matches the combined branch length of the primate comparison, had a similar true-positive rate of 84% (Figure 2c). The
more distant human-mouse comparison displayed a marginally higher true-positive rate of 90% (Figure 2b). This is consistent with the theoretical prediction that statistical power
increases with the total branch length of the species set [11].
It should be noted, though, that regulatory sequence annotation of the eight loci we analyzed is probably highly incomplete. Therefore, these true-positive rates are lower bounds;
some or all of the 'false positives' could eventually be reassigned as true positives upon expansion of the set of
sequences annotated as cis-regulatory. Thus, due to incomplete annotation of functional elements, it is not clear if the
difference between the primate and human-mouse true positive rates reflects a significant difference in reliability
between the two sets of predictions. On average, 64% of the
exons in the 8 loci overlapped conserved regions in both the
7-primate and 8-primate comparisons. Similar sensitivity
was obtained in human-mouse (65%) and human-dog (71%)
comparisons. Thus, primate sequence comparison was
approximately equivalent to pairwise human-mouse or
human dog analysis in identifying exons.

Phylogenetic shadowing using seven anthropoid
primates identifies non-coding sequences with
primate-specific conservation
To identify cis-regulatory sequences not detectable in comparisons between human and distant mammals, we searched
the 8 gene loci for non-coding sequences highly conserved
among primates (p value ≤ 0.005) but not detectable in

information

To independently confirm the (anthropoid) primate-specific
nature of sequence conservation in these six regions, we compared their nucleotide substitution rate to that of non-exonic
sequences in the same locus. Evolutionarily conserved
sequences are defined by a constraint factor (ratio of the substitution rate of test sequences to the non-exonic average)
smaller than 1. We found that the six primate-conserved

sequences had constraint factors well below 1 among anthropoid primates, as expected, and much closer to 1 in the
human-mouse and human-dog comparisons (Figure 3).
Finally, none of the 6 sequences overlapped significantly conserved segments identified by the phastCons program [12] in
a 17-species alignment of the human genome to (mostly) nonprimate mammals and more distant vertebrates [13], which
further confirms the primate-specificity of their evolutionary
conservation.

assay in human HepG2 cells and an in vivo mouse liver gene
transfer assay. Since it is possible that the computational prediction only captures part of the entire regulatory module,
each human element plus 200 to 400 base-pairs (bp) of flanking sequence on either side was cloned upstream of the
human promoter of the gene closest to each element and
fused to a luciferase reporter gene (see Materials and methods). Therefore, the included flanking sequences may also
contribute to the observed regulatory activity. Two elements
showed enhancer activity, increasing the expression of a luciferase reporter gene 1.6- to 5-fold in both the human liver cell
line HepG2 and in vivo in mouse liver, while a third element
appeared to be a silencer, suppressing luciferase expression
by 50% (Figure 4, Table 1 and data not shown). While a third
element, LDLR_PS2, showed modest enhancer activity in
HepG2 cells (approximately 1.6-fold increase over promoter
alone), its activity in 293T cells was much stronger (approximately 5-fold increase over promoter alone), presumably due
to availability in these cells of appropriate transcription factors, such as SREBFs, that are capable of activating LDLR
[14]. In an independent assay of transcription potential, both
enhancer elements were shown to be DNase I hypersensitive
sites in HepG2 cells (Figure 4, Table 1 and data not shown),
suggesting that the corresponding DNA elements are
involved in transcriptional regulation of the endogenous
genes. To confirm that the primate orthologs of these identified human regulatory elements are also functional, we
cloned the aligned LDLR PS4 sequences from baboon, dusky
titi, marmoset and lemur into the luciferase reporter vector

and tested their ability to drive reporter gene expression in
HepG2 cells. All orthologous non-human primate sequences
showed enhancer activity (Additional data file 3).

Regulatory sequences with primate-specific
conservation have functional orthologous mammalian
counterparts
Since these functional human regulatory elements exhibited
primate-specific sequence conservation, we explored whether
their functional role is unique to primates. Although humanmouse comparison failed to identify these sequences as constrained (Gumby p value > 0.1; Figures 1 and 3b), we were
able to identify the aligned counterparts to the three primateconserved functional sequences in mouse using the global
alignment program MLAGAN [15]. To explore the regulatory
function, if any, of these mouse orthologs, we cloned the
aligned sequences into the luciferase reporter vector
described above and compared their activity to that of the
human sequence. Despite the lack of statistically significant
conservation between the rodent and human sequence, all
three mouse orthologs exhibited regulatory activity in the
same direction to that observed for the human elements (data
not shown). Thus, the silencer and the two enhancers identified through primate-specific sequence conservation are
ancestral mammalian regulatory elements, rather than newly
evolved functional regions specific to primates.

A smaller set of three anthropoid primates is sufficient
to detect the newly identified regulatory elements

broader, mostly exceeding one at the upper limit. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals.

all the corresponding genome sequences will be available in
the near future. Of the set of most informative primate
genomes for comparative analysis [6], the human and rhesus
genome sequences are already publicly available, and the

marmoset genome is currently being sequenced. We tested
whether comparisons among these three species were
sufficient to detect functional sequences in the eight lipid
gene loci. Human-rhesus-marmoset comparison identified
55% of the 160 exons (versus 7 primates: 64%) with a truepositive rate of 72% (79% for 7 primates) (Figure 2a,d), suggesting that a significant fraction of exons can be detected

It is worth noting that the three detected regulatory elements
displayed only marginal sequence conservation in the
prosimian lemur. This result suggests that primate comparisons should be limited to anthropoids (old world monkeys
and new world monkeys) to sensitively detect divergent

Sequence divergence of the identified regulatory elements
between human and distant mammals may reflect functional
changes in these sequences. Cis-regulatory elements with primate-specific sequence conservation are, therefore, potential
substrates for determining the molecular basis of primatespecific aspects of gene expression. Previously, we described
gain of sterol responsiveness in the anthropoid primate
LDLR_PS2 enhancer [17] (Table 1). It is possible that primate-specific sequence conservation of the other two newly
identified regulatory elements also reflects qualitative or
quantitative expression differences between primates and
non-primate mammals, which might be revealed by further
in-depth functional characterization and sequence analysis.
On the other hand, it is also possible that the lack of significant sequence conservation of some regulatory elements in
distant mammals merely reflects the accumulation of compensatory mutations over tens of millions of years, which
would retain functional similarity in the absence of significant sequence similarity [18,19]. Finally, it is possible that
short sequence motifs such as transcription factor binding
sites within the newly discovered regulatory elements are
constrained in all mammals, while the entire elements are
significantly conserved only in primates. In one example, we
were able to find a conserved functional mammalian AP-4 site
in the LDLR_PS2 enhancer [17] (data not shown).

deposited research

Our results do not of course suggest that primate comparison
is optimal for detecting all classes of regulatory sequence. If a
human regulatory sequence is constrained in all mammals,
for example, then multi-mammal species comparison is
clearly preferable to primate comparison, since the mammalian species tree has greater combined branch length and,
consequently, greater statistical power. However, it is well
known that many human regulatory elements show no evidence of constraint in mammalian comparisons [2]. We have
demonstrated for the first time that primate comparisons can
robustly identify at least some members of this class of
'mammal-diverged' human regulatory sequences, even in
large (approximately 100 kb) genomic regions.

As a consequence of high sequence identity between humans
and great apes, our closest relatives, chimpanzee and gorilla,
add very little to the power of primate sequence comparisons.
The phylogenetically most informative set of primate species
includes old world monkeys (for example, rhesus macaque)
and new world monkeys (for example, marmoset), in addition
to human [6,7]. The three functional sequences revealed by
seven-primate comparison were also detectable in the threeway human-rhesus-marmoset analysis, albeit less robustly,
due to the shorter combined branch length of the three-way
comparisons. Since the human and rhesus genome sequences
are already publicly available, and the marmoset genome is
currently being sequenced, our results support the feasibility
of genome-wide discovery of primate-conserved regulatory
elements.

reports

Our analysis of over 500 kb of sequence from each of 7 primate species revealed 6 non-coding elements significantly
conserved exclusively in primates, of which 3 were found to
have gene regulatory activity in a variety of in vitro and in
vivo assays. These three regulatory sequences are so weakly
conserved in distant, non-primate mammals that none of the
three independent methods we tested were able to detect
them in mammalian comparisons. However, primate-specific
conservation does not imply primate-specific function. Since
the mouse orthologs are also functional, the identified
sequences appear to be ancestral mammalian regulatory elements, as opposed to newly evolved functional sequences specific to primates. Nonetheless, it is likely that primate
sequence comparison could also identify the subset of functional sequences that arose after primates split from distant
mammals.

mammalian cis-regulatory elements. It is not clear at this
point how many additional functional non-coding elements
could be detected in the human genome on the basis of primate shadowing, relative to the number of elements already
identifiable using the available mammalian genome
sequences. However, it is encouraging that, at a conservation
p value threshold of 0.005, primate shadowing expanded the
set of predicted non-coding functional elements by 55% (6
elements with primate-specific sequence conservation versus
11 predicted by human-mouse and human-dog) in the 8 loci
examined in this study. Further large-scale studies are
required to precisely quantify the value added by multipleprimate analysis.

Discussion

comment

assessed the ability of human-rhesus-marmoset comparison
to detect the three newly identified regulatory sequences. As
was observed in the comparison of 7 anthropoid primates,
both LDLR enhancers were highly conserved (p value
<0.005) in the 3-way primate analysis and ranked among the
three most conserved non-coding sequences in the 75 kb
genomic region (data not shown). The smaller set of 3 primates was also sufficient to detect the silencer in the SREBF1
locus (non-coding rank 1), though not as strongly (p value =
0.044; Figure 1c). The lower statistical significance of the
SREBF1 silencer in the three-primate analysis relative to the
seven-primate analysis is due to the lower combined branch
length of the former. These results suggest that availability of
the marmoset genome sequence will facilitate genome-wide
analysis of primate-specific conservation, and uncover regulatory sequences that are undetectable in distant, non-primate comparisons.

Conclusion

Our results demonstrate that deep intra-primate sequence
comparison can be used to identify functional modules such
as exons, enhancers and silencers in large genomic regions.
Most importantly, analysis of primate-specific conservation
allowed detection of three divergent ancestral cis-regulatory
elements, which were not detectable by more distant mammalian comparisons. With the availability of multiple primate
genomes, it should be possible to improve the functional
annotation of the human genome by uncovering numerous
such cis-regulatory sequences, some of which potentially contribute to gene expression differences between primates and
distant mammals.

significant conservation in an alignment of 17 vertebrate
genomes [12].
Evolutionarily conserved regions identified by Gumby were
visualized using RankVISTA [25]. Conservation scores in the
RankVISTA plots were calculated as the negative logarithm of
the Gumby p value.
The constraint factor of a conserved non-coding sequence
(CNS) was defined as the nucleotide substitution rate
(summed over all branches of the phylogenetic tree) within
the element divided by the local background substitution rate
at intronic and intergenic positions in the locus (neutral rate).
We estimated substitution rates along each lineage by maximum likelihood using fastDNAml [26].

Materials and methods
Sources of sequence and annotation data

Plasmid constructs

Primate bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones containing targeted loci were purchased from Children's Hospital
Oakland Research Institute in Oakland, California [20]. Draft
sequences of baboon, colobus, dusky titi, marmoset, owl
monkey, squirrel monkey, and lemur BACs were determined
by sequencing ends of 3 kb subclones to 8- to 10-fold coverage
using BigDye terminators (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA, USA) and assembling reads into contigs with the PhredPhrap-Consed suite as described previously [21]. All BAC
sequences were submitted to GenBank (see Additional data
file 6 for accession numbers). Human, mouse, dog and rhesus
sequences were downloaded from the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics worldwide web site [13]. Based on the human
March 2006 assembly hg18, the coordinates for the analyzed
human loci are: SREBF1, chr17:17653939-17690020;
CYP7A1, chr8: 59525742-59605413; LDLR, chr19:1105414611127904;

HMGCR,
chr5:7464652274714122; LXRα, chr11:47231580-47253367. Exon annotations of these regions were obtained from the UCSC Genome
Bioinformatics website [13]. The promoter sequence of a gene
is defined as the 1 kb region upstream of the transcription
start site. Four enhancers in the APOE locus were previously
described [22,23]. These four APOE enhancers, together with
15 promoters in the 8 genomic loci, comprise the set of known
regulatory regions.

The human promoter was cloned in the proper orientation
upstream of the luciferase cDNA in the pGL3Basic construct
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The primate-specific elements from human or mouse were PCR cloned into polylinker
sites upstream of the promoter of the closest gene (see Additional data file 5 for primer sequences). Each human element
includes the primate-conserved sequence plus approximately
200 to 400 bp of flanking sequence. Thus, approximately
1,000 bp of total sequence are tested in each reporter
construct.

Analysis of sequence conservation
All sequence alignments were carried out using MLAGAN
[15]. Aligned sequences were scanned for statistically significant (p value ≤ 0.1) evolutionarily conserved regions using
Gumby [3,9,10]. We defined primate-specific conserved elements as those human sequences that were highly conserved
(Gumby p value ≤ 0.005) among anthropoid primates, but
not conserved in more distant mammalian comparisons.
Mammalian sequence conservation was defined as: p value ≤
0.1 in human-mouse or human-dog comparison; or 70%
human-mouse sequence identity over at least 100 bp [24]; or

Transient-transfection reporter assay
Cells were grown at 37°C and 5% CO2 in the minimum essential medium (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) (HepG2), or
Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (ATCC) (293T cells),
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan,
UT, USA), L-glutamine and penicillin-streptomycin. The cells
were grown in 12-well plates (6 × 104 cells/well for HepG2, 4
× 104 cells/well for 293T) and transfected using Fugene
(Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN, USA) following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 500 ng (for
HepG2) or 100 ng (for 293T) of each assayed plasmid and 50
ng (for HepG2) or 10 ng (for 293T) pCMVβ (BD Biosciences,
San Jose, CA, USA) were mixed with 1.5 μl Fugene and added
to each well. Following 42 to 48 hours of incubation, cells
were harvested and lysed. Activity of luciferase and β-galactosidase was measured using the Luciferase Assay System
(Promega) and galacto-Light Plus (Applied Biosystems),
respectively. Luciferase activity for each sample was normalized to the β-galactosidase assay control. Transfections were
carried out in duplicates. All experiments are representative
of at least three independent transfections.

Tail vein plasmid DNA transfer assays
Tail vein injection was performed as described by Herweijer
and Wolff [27] following the TransIT® In Vivo Gene Delivery
System Protocol (Mirus Corporation, Madison, WI, USA). Six
to nine FVB male mice (Charles River Laboratory, Wilmington, MA, USA) at age 7 to 8 weeks were used for each reporter

DNase I-hypersensitive site mapping was performed as
described previously [28]. Briefly, cell pellets were resuspended in DNase I digestion buffer containing 0.5% IGEPAL
(tert-Octylphenoxy poly(oxyethylene)ethanol) at 2 × 107
cells/ml buffer. Aliquots (100 μl) of the resuspended cells
were mixed with equal volumes of DNase I buffer containing
varying concentrations of DNase I.The DNase I digestion
reaction was incubated at 23°C for 5 minutes before being
stopped with the addition of 8 μl of 0.5 M EDTA and 2 μl of
100 mg/ml RNase A.Following 5 minutes of RNase A treatment, genomic DNA was isolated using the QiaQuickPCR Kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Then, 10 μg of each of the DNA
samples was digested with an appropriate restriction enzyme
and resolved in a 1.2% agarose gel by electrophoresis. The
DNA from the gel was then transferred onto a nylon membrane. Southern blotting was carried out with a radiolabeled
DNA probe generated by PCR amplification (see Additional
data file 5 for primer sequences), and corresponds to regions
of approximately 1,000 bp from Gumby predicted elements.
Following hybridization and washing, the blot was exposed to
Biomax film (Kodak Co., Rochester, NY, USA) with intensifying screens at -80°C for 48 hours.
