MotifMap: integrative genome-wide maps of
regulatory motif sites for model species
Kenneth Daily1,2, Vishal R Patel1,2, Paul Rigor1,2, Xiaohui Xie1,2 and Pierre Baldi1,2,3*

Abstract
Background: A central challenge of biology is to map and understand gene regulation on a genome-wide scale.
For any given genome, only a small fraction of the regulatory elements embedded in the DNA sequence have
been characterized, and there is great interest in developing computational methods to systematically map all
these elements and understand their relationships. Such computational efforts, however, are significantly hindered
by the overwhelming size of non-coding regions and the statistical variability and complex spatial organizations of
regulatory elements and interactions. Genome-wide catalogs of regulatory elements for all model species simply
do not yet exist.
Results: The MotifMap system uses databases of transcription factor binding motifs, refined genome alignments,
and a comparative genomic statistical approach to provide comprehensive maps of candidate regulatory elements
encoded in the genomes of model species. The system is used to derive new genome-wide maps for yeast, fly,
worm, mouse, and human. The human map contains 519,108 sites for 570 matrices with a False Discovery Rate of
0.1 or less. The new maps are assessed in several ways, for instance using high-throughput experimental ChIP-seq
data and AUC statistics, providing strong evidence for their accuracy and coverage. The maps can be usefully
integrated with many other kinds of omic data and are available at http://motifmap.igb.uci.edu/.
Conclusions: MotifMap and its integration with other data provide a foundation for analyzing gene regulation on
a genome-wide scale, and for automatically generating regulatory pathways and hypotheses. The power of this
approach is demonstrated and discussed using the P53 apoptotic pathway and the Gli hedgehog pathways as
examples.

Background
A central challenge of biology is to map and understand
gene regulation on a genome-wide scale. For any given
genome, only a small fraction of the regulatory elements
embedded in the DNA sequence have been characterized,
and there is great interest in developing computational
methods to systematically map all these elements and
understand their relationships. Such computational efforts,
however, are significantly hindered by the overwhelming
size of non-coding regions and the statistical variability
and complex spatial organizations of regulatory elements
and interactions, especially in mammalian species.
While many gene-specific, condition-specific, and factor-specific resources for motif binding sites exist [1-4],

it is perhaps surprising that genome-wide systematic
catalogs of binding sites for most species do not. Past
efforts have focused primarily on the yeast and fly genomes and with severe restrictions, for instance in terms
of data (e.g. ChIP-seq only) or genomic regions (e.g.
promoter only). The prototype MotifMap system [5]
used an improved comparative genomics approach to
provide one of the first genome-wide maps for the
human genome and test its accuracy. This system, however, has several limitations including the direct use of
coarse genome alignments for searching for binding
sites leading to missed and incorrectly scored sites, and
the unavailability of maps for other model species.
Furthermore, while the available lists of transcription
factors are not exhaustive, new information about transcription factors and regulatory interactions is continuously being produced and thus such maps must be
periodically updated.

Here we describe improvements to the prototype
methods that are used with a new whole-genome alignment and an expanded list of transcription factors to
create a new, more comprehensive, map for the human
genome. Furthermore, we apply the updated methodology to the genomes of other model organisms for which
alignments and estimated phylogenetic trees are available, creating genome-wide maps for the yeast, worm,
fly and mouse genomes.
At its core, MotifMap uses data from transcription
factor binding motif databases, specifically JASPAR [6]
and TRANSFAC [7]. For yeast and fly, we have supplemented the matrices available from JASPAR and
TRANSFAC with those available from a number of publications (see Additional file 1 for a full list of the
sources for each species). The binding matrices are used
to search a reference genome for binding sites and produce three scores at each site. The first score is the
Normalized Log-Odds (NLOD) score derived from the
position weight matrix of the corresponding transcription factor. The second score is the Bayesian Branch
Length Score (BBLS) to measure the degree of evolutionary conservation. Functional elements, such as those
playing a regulatory role, often evolve more slowly than
neutral sequences and can be detected by their higher
level of conservation. MotifMap uses publicly available
whole genome alignments and the corresponding phylogenetic trees to leverage the power of comparative genomics in order to eliminate false positive hits. The third
score is the False Discovery Rate (FDR) estimated by
using Monte Carlo methods. The three scores at each
site are used, in combination with other filters, to generate genome-wide maps.
The quality of the maps is assessed and compared
against our previous results [5] as well as other methods
[8,9] in various ways, including comparison to experimental data, such as high-throughput ChIP-seq data.
The maps provide a foundation for inferring regulatory
networks and can be integrated with a variety of other
heterogeneous and autonomous data sources.

Methods
Normalized Log-Odds score (NLOD)

Binding sites for each transcription factor are identified
by scanning the genome sequence with a position
weight matrix. We transform each original weight
matrix into a log-odds matrix to account for the background frequency of the nucleotides across the genome.
The log-odds score of a sequence is computed as
|S|

LOD(S) =

f (x)
j=1

Page 2 of 13

Where
f (x) =

log2 (x) if qij > ebi 2c
x
c
e2c log(2) + c if qij ≤ ebi 2
q

where x = bij , the value qij from the position weight
i
matrix is the probability of observing nucleotide i({A, C,
G, T}) at position j in a sequence S of length |S|, and bi
is the probability of observing nucleotide i in the entire
genome. For reasonable values of qij corresponding to x
>e2c, the function is simply equal to log2(x). However,
for small values of qij corresponding to x ≤ e2c, the logarithm function can take large negative values. Traditionally, to avoid this problem, pseudocounts are added to
the frequency matrices, in a heuristic and matrix-dependent fashion. The alternative approach proposed here
lower bounds the values of each scoring matrix directly
by replacing the log function around zero with a continuous linear approximation. In this work, we use c = -3.
The motif matching score is scaled to fall between 0
and 1 to yield the normalized log-odds score:
NLOD(x) =

LOD(x) − ymin
ymax − ymin

where ymax and ymin are the maximum and minimum
LOD scores that the matrix can achieve by using the
most likely or least likely nucleotide at each position. A
z-score is also derived from the NLOD score by estimating the mean and variance of the score of random
sequences across the genome. For mammalian species,
we use a z-score threshold of 4.27, corresponding to a
p-value of 0.00001, to find a list of initial candidate sites
across the reference genome. For yeast, fly, and worm,
we use a lower threshold corresponding to a z-score
between 2.57 and 3.72, or a p-value between 0.005 and
0.0001. Finally, we restrict the total number of binding
sites by ordering the sites for each motif individually by
their z-score, and keeping sites with a z-score at least as
high as the kth site. For our purposes, k = 100,000, as
was done in the prototype version.
Bayesian Branch Length Score (BBLS)

Many previous methods have shown that evolutionary
conservation can be used to identify transcription factor
binding sites [10-12]. An innovative aspect of the MotifMap system is how the degree of evolutionary conservation is assessed using the Bayesian Branch Length Score
(BBLS) [5], which itself is an improvement over a previous score, the Branch Length Score (BLS) [13,14].
More precisely, given a multiple alignment of N species
and their evolutionary tree, a transcription factor motif,
and the genome coordinates of a candidate binding site,

Daily et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2011, 12:495

let s i = 0 or 1 denote the presence or absence of the
motif at the aligned location in the corresponding species i. The BLS is simply the total length of the branches
associated with the most recent common ancestor of all
the species for which si is set to 1. However, in reality
si is not a binary variable but rather comes with a probability pi measuring the degree of confidence in whether
the corresponding motif is present or not in species i at
the corresponding location. Given a set of N aligned
species, the BBLS takes into account this uncertainty by
computing the expected BLS in the form:
BBLS = E(BLS)
P(σ1 , . . . , σN )BLS(σ1 , . . . σN )

=
σ1 ,...,σN

(1)

r1 . . . rN BLS(σ1 , . . . σN )

=
σ1 ,...,σN

Where
ri =

pi if σi = 1
1 − pi if σi = 0

The values of pi for the leaves of the tree are derived
using the NLOD score described above. If the corresponding z-score is too low, pi is set to 0. An efficient
dynamic programming approach, avoiding the addition
of an exponential number of terms (Equation 1), has
been derived [5], and a corresponding software implementation is available (see below).
False Discovery Rate (FDR)

For every motif weight matrix, we generate control
matrices by randomly shuffling the columns of the motif
weight matrix. The shuffling is repeated up to 10,000
times so as to produce up to 10 control matrices. The
shuffled matrices must be sufficiently different from the
original one to be used as control matrices. In practice,
we use a cutoff of 0.35 on the similarity measure computed by first taking the average correlation between
columns over pairs of windows of length 8 in the original and permuted motif, then taking the maximum of
these correlations over all pairs of windows, and then
normalizing by the length of the motif. Only binding
matrices are retained that: (1) are at least eight nucleotides long; and (2) can produce at least three sufficiently
different shuffled versions for the Monte Carlo FDR
procedure. In addition, for mammalian species, each
shuffled matrix is restricted to have the same CG-dinucleotide frequency as the original matrix. The same
motif searching procedure is used with each control
matrix. The False Discovery Rate is computed as the
median number of sites found using the shuffled
matrices divided by the number of sites found for the

real matrix at a particular (NLOD, BBLS) score combination or higher.
Sequence alignments and modular design

The prototype version of MotifMap searched the lowresolution multiple alignment files obtained from the
UCSC Genome Browser [15] directly. As a result, possible alignments of a motif could be missed in other species, for example in poorly aligned regions with many
gaps. To address this problem, the overall methodology
used to search for aligned transcription factor binding
sites has been considerably improved (Figure 1).
The new approach searches instead the reference genome directly and uses the low-resolution alignments
only as a seed to identify regions in other species aligning to the motif in the reference species. An expanded
sequence including 15 base pairs on each side of each
binding site in the reference species is used to identify
aligned regions in the other genomes. This expanded
sequence helps compensate for the low-resolution nature of the whole genome alignments [16]. Furthermore,
instead of using the aligned regions directly, which may
be too short or contain many gaps, we find all the alignment blocks overlapping the expanded sequence. Due to
the nature of the algorithm used to build the multiple
alignments, the sequences in different aligning blocks
for any single species may be very far apart from each
other on the chromosome, or even on completely separate chromosomes. As a result, we only concatenate
blocks that are within 30 base pairs of each other (maintaining any intervening sequence). This operation yields
a set of blocks of aligning regions; each block contains
sequences from other species aligned to the binding site.
For each species, we find the motif sequence with the
highest normalized log-odds score across all blocks.
Finally, the scores corresponding to the selected
sequence from each species are used for BBLS scoring.
In practice, requiring a minimum number of species to
be aligned to the reference sequence at each binding
site improves performance. The default requirement,
used for instance in the case of the yeast map, is set to
at least one other species (i.e. BBLS >0). For the human
map, in the public version of MotifMap, binding sites
are required to be conserved across at least four nonprimate species. This also enables a fair comparison to
the prototype version that used the same requirement.
Because the new modular design of MotifMap is not
dependent on searching the UCSC coarse multiple
alignment files directly, it enables one to also use other
alignments if necessary, such as high resolution alignments of the upstream regions of known homologous or
orthologous genes, even when these are not in the
UCSC format (e.g. the MAF format produced by the
multiz alignment software), or to focus the search on

NLOD scores. Using the sequence around each site, overlapping aligned blocks of sequence are extracted from the multiple alignment. Nearby
blocks are merged and then the best motif binding site in each species is found. The scores of the best motif sequences for each species are
used to compute the BBLS score.

any subset of the genome. To avoid bias from binding
sites that occur in regions that are conserved for being
part of a translated portion of a gene and are not necessarily under positive selection because of their importance for regulatory control, we exclude exonic regions
of the genome from the default public version of MotifMap. Likewise, we exclude repetitive regions.
Redundancy filter

A transcription factor is often annotated with multiple
binding matrices in JASPAR and TRANSFAC. For
example, each matrix may represent a specific isoform
of the factor dependent on the biological context (e.g.
cell type or experimental condition). However, in order
to estimate a total number of unique potential binding
sites, a given site can be counted only once for a given
transcription factor, even when this factor has multiple
binding matrices. For this purpose, we first perform
the genome-wide search independently for each
matrix, and then group overlapping binding sites. We
choose a representative for each transcription factor in
that group by picking the site with the highest BBLS

score. The final result is a non-overlapping, nonredundant, list of binding sites for each transcription
factor.

Results
New MotifMaps

Each MotifMap is generated automatically via a pipeline
running on a parallel computer cluster. Comprehensive
maps for human, mouse, fly, worm, and yeast have been
generated and new maps can be produced automatically.
Details about the genomes, alignments, and matrices
used in each MotifMap can be seen in Table 1. The raw
data for the total number of binding sites across the
genomes ranges from hundreds of thousands for yeast,
worm, and fly to millions for mouse and human. Table
2 summarizes the number of transcription factors,
matrices, and binding sites for each available species
after all filtering steps have been applied. For the human
MotifMap, we predict 519,108 binding sites for 570
matrices, nearly a 5-fold increase over the number of
sites and matrices in the prototype version, while maintaining a low FDR of 0.1 or less.

Evaluation of new methods using experimental data

We first compare the updated methodology to the prototype version using data on well-studied transcription
factors and experimentally-determined binding sites
using high-throughput methods, such as ChIP-seq.
While ChIP-seq and related methods are not perfect,
they still provide the best available experimental approximations to genome-wide maps of binding sites. While
the prototype map used 17 species, a larger number of
genomes and genome alignments has become available
since its publication. Thus, for comparison purposes, we
run the new methodology using both the same tree of
17 species used for the first prototype, as well as an
expanded tree containing 32 placental mammals.
Specifically, we consider the same set of highly studied
transcription factors (Table 3), same motifs, same
experimental data [17-22], and same whole genome
alignments as in Xie et al. [5], to compute the area
under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)
curves (AUC) using the updated methodology. For all
motifs, we see an improvement of the AUC in the range
of 1-5% over the previous version. [Note that when
computing the AUC, we include all ChIP-seq regions
that do not contain a conserved motif binding site in
the class of true negatives, as in [5]. However, we still
robustly observe improvements in the range of 0-5%

when not including these regions in the class of true
negatives.] For P53, CTCF, and NRSE, we observe an
increase in the AUC with a decrease in the number of
sites found. For NFKB and STAT1, we observe a modest
increase in the number of sites along with an increase in
the AUC. We also observe further modest improvements for a few of these transcription factors when the
number of species in the multiple alignments is
increased from 17 to 32 placental mammals (see the
UCSC Genome Browser website for details on the species in each alignment).
We also use ChIP-seq data available for 35 mouse
transcription factors obtained from the TRANSFAC
suite to further assess the performance of the MotifMap
pipeline and compare it with other methods. We evaluate the performance of the BBLS scoring scheme to
recover known binding sites identified by ChIP-seq
against four other scores: BLS [13,14], NLOD (as
described in this work), PhastCons [8], and PhyloP [9].
Each score is individually used to rank the binding sites
identified by MotifMap. We calculate the number of
true and false positive sites identified in the ChIP-seq
data to compute the AUC, as in Xie et. al. [5]. Table 4
summarizes the results for the performance of the
MotifMap pipeline in recovering the sites identified by
the ChIP-seq methods by reporting the results for the
20 top transcription factors with the largest AUC values.
For these 20 transcription factors, we see performances
comparable to those seen for the human MotifMap:
MotifMap achieves the best AUC result in 16 of them,
while relatively small differences (3% or less) are seen
for the remaining four, providing further evidence of the
overall quality of the MotifMap system and its ability to
generalize and identify binding sites in other species.
Localization analysis: binding site location properties

To further assess the quality of the maps, we examine
the distribution of the candidate sites relative to the

locations of genes across the genome. Using the high
confidence data (FDR ≤ 0.1), we find that the majority
of sites are within 1 Kbp of the transcription start sites
(TSS) of known genes across all species. Figure 2 shows
a plot of the distribution of distance to the closest gene
for each binding site for the human genome. This distribution becomes increasingly peaked as one increases the
BBLS threshold filter (Figures 3a, b). However, we note
that we also find high-confidence sites significantly far
from known transcription start sites (further than 100
Kbp away). These sites would be missed in a promoteronly analysis of transcription factor binding sites. We
see similar distributions for mouse, while for smaller
genomes (such as yeast and fly) the binding sites are
even closer to the transcription start sites. This is
expected, since the genomes of these species are more
condensed, including shorter promoter and intragenic
regions.
MotifMap system, web server, and data integration

The MotifMap “system” consists of three main components: (1) a computational pipeline to perform the genome-wide search; (2) a database to store candidate motif
binding sites, the scores associated with them, and the
relationships to other features; (3) custom code to interface between the database and a web service; and (4) a

Flex web application, to display data to users. All steps
in the pipeline for identifying and scoring binding sites
are performed in parallel using a high performance
computer cluster. Along with the locations and scores
for each binding site, we compile and store relationships
between the binding sites and other genomic features,
such as genes (RefSeq [23] and Ensembl [24]) and Gene
Ontology (GO) annotations [25]. Some species (fly and
yeast) use specific gene annotation resources instead
(FlyBase [26] and SGD [27]). The database is currently
being expanded as other MotifMaps and new relationships become available. The binding site data and relationships for all available species are publicly available
through the MotifMap web site (http://motifmap.igb.uci.
edu).
While the prototype MotifMap version had a simple
interface to display data, the new web application has
been extensively upgraded with multiple features and
functionalities to allow users to explore these genomewide datasets more easily. User can interactively select a
model species and one or more transcription factors,
visualize the logos of the corresponding motifs, filter the
results by various criteria and thresholds (genome location, NLOD/z-score, BBLS, FDR), and retrieve a corresponding list of binding sites, with the distances to the
nearest TSS and the corresponding gene annotations.
The results can be downloaded in a variety of standard
formats (GFF, BED, CSV) or exported directly for visualization in the UCSC Genome Browser. Furthermore,
for each motif binding site, users can view the local
multiple alignment and the phylogenetic tree with the
corresponding probability scores for each species, as
shown in simplified form at the bottom of Figure 1. A
Python implementation of an efficient algorithm for
computing the Bayesian Branch Length Score can also
be downloaded from the MotifMap web site. MotifMap
uses an integrative approach combining, for instance,
phylogenetic, genomic, and transcription factor data.
The resulting maps themselves can in turn be integrated
with many other datasets (see Discussion). Two kinds of
data that are fully integrated into the MotifMap database and available to the user are GO annotations and
SNPs. For instance, for a given GO annotation and the
corresponding set of genes, user can retrieve all the
nearby candidate binding sites. Likewise, SNPs falling
within or near a transcription factor binding site have
the potential for influencing the regulation of the corresponding gene [28]. Thus it is useful to be able to list
which SNPs in a GWAS (Genome Wide Association
Study) or other genotyping study fall within or nearby
transcription factor binding sites. Analyses of GWAS
data focused primarily on coding regions run the risk of
missing important SNPs affecting regulatory regions.
The relationship between SNPs and binding sites has

been integrated into the MotifMap web application as
an additional analysis tool called SNPer, which allows
the retrieval of motif binding sites that overlap with
SNP sites. The HapMap3 [29] and dbSNP [30] datasets
are currently available for use with the mouse and

the P53 apoptotic pathway, since it is an important and
well-studied pathway which allows us to assess the quality of the predictions. We also apply the same general
ideas to the Gli family of transcription factors and the
hedgehog pathway to demonstrate the effectiveness of
these methods on a relatively less-studied transcription
factor family and pathway where important regulatory
effects remain to be discovered.

Discussion
The MotifMap approach has allowed us to derive stateof-the-art genome-wide maps of candidate regulatory
elements for some of the main model organisms, in particular for mouse and human. For the worm, the map
produced is considerably more primitive because only
six transcription factor binding matrices are available in
TRANSFAC and JASPAR. However, the availability of
the map for this limited set of transcription factors may
still be of some use and all the maps will be updated as
more binding matrices become available.
Each binding site predicted by MotifMap corresponds
in fact to a regulatory hypothesis, thus a single MotifMap can generate from thousands to millions of
hypotheses. These hypotheses can be tested and refined
in the laboratory, either individually in the case of very
specific interactions which can be tested with great precision, or on a larger but less precise scale using highthroughput methods, such as ChIP-seq. These multiple
hypotheses can also be further refined and analyzed by
computational methods using integrative approaches
where regulatory hypotheses are simultaneously combined: (1) with each other in the form of regulatory networks; and (2) with other kinds of data. Regulatory
hypotheses can be integrated with each other to identify
regulatory networks of transcription factors, including
regulatory loops and, for instance, hypothesize that transcription factor A regulates transcription factor B, transcription factor B regulates transcription factor C, and
transcription factor C regulates transcription factor A.
These networks and loops can be thought of as the core
regulatory network of a cell. Regulatory hypotheses can
also be integrated with many other kinds of data to
refine regulatory inferences, as described in the Results
section using GO and SNP data and below with other
kinds of data. In particular, MotifMap and GO annotations can be used to infer the common functions of a
set of genes targeted by a transcription factor or, conversely, to infer the transcription factor that may regulate a set of genes with common GO annotations. To
illustrate these ideas, here we give a simple demonstration of the power of integrating MotifMap and other
data to generate regulatory network hypotheses, above
the level of an individual regulatory site. For demonstration purposes, we choose two examples. We reconstruct

Mouse P53 apoptotic pathway

We attempt to reconstruct the P53 direct regulatory
interactions in the mouse P53 apoptotic pathway using
data from MotifMap for putative P53 binding sites
across the genome. We first compile a list of over 380
unique gene transcripts from the RefSeq database [23]
annotated with the Gene Ontology term “Apoptosis”
(GO:0006915). We then retrieve predicted P53 binding
sites from MotifMap in the promoter region of these
genes to generate a regulatory network of P53’s role in
apoptosis. The promoter region of a gene is defined as
15 Kbp upstream and 3 Kbp downstream, which
approximately encompasses the region associated with
the first intron, from the transcription start site. To
evaluate the network generated from MotifMap data, we
compare it to the P53 pathway described in the KEGG
database [31], which reports 14 genes directly regulated
by P53 in the apoptotic pathway (Figure 4). Table 5
shows the number of known and potentially novel P53
targets predicted as a function of FDR. At a FDR of
0.05, we predict eight target genes from the list of all
apoptotic genes, six of which are annotated in KEGG.
Searching the literature reveals that the other two target
proteins, DDIT4 and PHLDA3, are also known targets
of P53 [32,33] but not annotated in KEGG. At a FDR of
0.25, we predict a total of 71 targets, including 12 of the
14 targets annotated in KEGG; the only exceptions are
FAS and TSAP6 (also called STEAP3). FAS is a predicted direct target, but has a slightly higher FDR (0.28).
For TSAP6 we find two P53 sites (1784 bp and 4582 bp
upstream) with a strong motif matching score; however
these sites are not conserved. A novel predicted target is
BID, which is annotated in KEGG as a downstream
indirect target in the P53 apoptotic pathway. If we
reduce the length of the upstream promoter regions
from 15 Kbp down to 5 Kbp, the same KEGG targets
are recovered with the exception of PIDD and SHSA5.
A few targets have P53 binding sites downstream of the
TSS, in the first intron, and these would not have been
recovered with a search focused on promoter regions
only. Thus in short the MotifMap system is capable of
robustly recovering most of the direct targets of P53
described in KEGG, as well as providing a ranked list of
potential new targets, some of which can be confirmed
by a literature search.

targets identified by MotifMap with FDR < 0.05 which have been reported in the literature but are not present in KEGG.

Mouse Gli hedgehog pathway

Next, we examine the Gli family of transcription factors.
Although Gli is a relatively less studied transcription
factor, mutations in Gli genes have been associated with
multiple developmental disorders and cancers [34]. We
first compile a list of Gli targets. The KEGG database
lists only two annotated targets of Gli1 (Hhip and
Ptch1), as well as an autoregulatory loop of Gli1. Gli1 is
annotated as a downstream effector of the Sonic hedgehog pathway [34]. In addition, Gli1 is known to regulate
the Wnt signaling pathways [35]. Due to the lack of
many annotated targets in KEGG, we used the Transcriptional Regulatory Element Database (TRED) [36],
which contains an additional four annotated Gli family
targets. We find Gli binding sites predicted by MotifMap in the promoter region of the seven annotated targets and also many of the Wnt proteins. We observe
predicted binding sites in the Shh promoter (14,843 bp
upstream) as well as in the second intron. In addition,
we recover the Gli1 autoregulatory loop [37] and regulation of Gli3 by Gli1 [38] (Figure 5a). All binding sites

for all targets are recovered at an estimated FDR ≤ 0.25,
within 15 Kbp upstream and 3 Kbp downstream of each
gene. Furthermore, we identify a highly conserved binding site (BBLS >7, perfectly conserved in 27 out of the
30 species in the alignment) near Ptch1. Nkx2-8 and
Nkx2-2, both of which have been reported as targets of
Gli family transcription factors [39,40], have predicted
binding sites within 2 Kbp upstream of the transcription
start site with similar conservation (Figure 5b). We also
identify Rab34 as a true Gli target [39] at a lower conservation level (BBLS >2); this threshold includes
approximately 100 novel targets.
Further integration and challenges

Regulatory networks do not consist only of transcription
factors and their direct regulatory interactions, but can
include also protein-protein interactions (PPI). Integrating PPI (physical or genetic) data [41,42] with proteinDNA interactions from MotifMap can yield a more
comprehensive view of molecular mechanisms and networks. Integration of PPI data can also facilitate the
identification of transcriptional complexes. For example,
evidence for a complex based on adjacency of binding
sites for two transcription factors could be strengthened
by data supporting physical interactions between these
factors. In general, however, factors with proximal binding sites need not physically interact with each other in
order to influence transcription, and MotifMap data can
be used to identify modules of transcription factors with
co-occurring binding sites near co-regulated genes. To

derive a more accurate and complete global picture, it is
also important to incorporate information about RNA
elements involved in gene regulation [43]. As so far
described, MotifMap provides a static view of potential
transcription-factor/DNA interactions. Since transcription factor regulation of most genes does not occur ubiquitously or constantly across all cells in an organism,
DNA microarrays and high-throughput sequencing of
transcripts (RNA-seq) provide another important source
of information about the cell-specific, tissue-specific, or
condition-specific expression of genes. Thus MotifMap
can be integrated with gene expression data, such as the
Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data [44]. This integration provides additional information about, for
instance, the average direction of a particular interaction
(up- or down-regulation) across many experiments, or
about the specific portion of the total potential regulatory network that is activated in a given condition. An
important challenge ahead lies in better understanding
the role of epigenetics in the regulation of gene transcription. An interesting source of data for further integration with MotifMap comes from the ENCODE
project [45] providing the locations of epigenetic

signatures, such as histone tail methylations or acetylations, across the human genome for a large number of
cell lines. Combinations of these markers can identify
transcription factor binding sites that are specific to a
particular cell line; for example, the presence of
H3K4Me1 and absence of H3K4Me3 denotes enhancer
regions. This integration induces regulatory sub-networks, potentially describing important interactions
needed for a particular cell type to function properly.
Another considerable challenge is the role of chromatin
and 3D structure in gene regulation. New high-throughput
techniques like Chromosome Conformation Capture-onChip (4C), Hi-C and Chromatin Interaction Analysis using
Paired-End Tag sequencing (ChIA-PET) allow the detection of long range or inter-chromosomal interactions of
DNA [46-48]. This provides the ability to detect regulatory
elements that may be distal to the gene they regulate linearly, but are brought close together in 3-dimensional
space. For instance, a recent study used 4C to investigate
the properties and dynamics of the genomic loci that are
in contact with glucocorticoid receptor (GR) responsive
loci [49]. Incorporating this kind of data into MotifMap
could provide further evidence of these distant regulatory

Daily et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2011, 12:495

interactions and improve our ability to infer regulatory
mechanisms and networks.
Many other data, such as scientific literature, or information about diseases and drugs, are also being integrated in house with MotifMap. Each data comes with
its own noise and limitations and it is the combination
of diverse lines of evidence that has the power to solidify inferences and rank hypotheses in a relevant way.
This integration process is not new, of course, and in
essence is at the root of IBM’s Watson system for the
game of Jeopardy [50]. This integration process is
ongoing and raises computational challenges both in its
execution and in what can be served publicly given a
limited amount of computational resources.
Finally, another potential computational challenge for
systems like MotifMap is the dynamic use of evolutionary trees and comparative genomics. The current version of MotifMap builds a genome-wide map, assessing
conservation with a single static tree for each species.
But clearly not all regulatory elements are conserved,
and even when they are, the optimal tree for assessing
their degree of conservation may vary with each transcription factor and each biological question. Thus
studying how to dynamically assess conservation, including its weaker forms [51,52], and how to discover regulatory elements that are poorly conserved remain
important questions for further investigations.

Conclusion
The MotifMap system aims to provide comprehensive
genome-wide map of regulatory elements for each organism. Since experimental data on gene expression obtained
with DNA microarray or high-throughput sequencing
methods is inherently biased (to a specific condition, cell
type, etc.), a resource that catalogs transcription factor
binding sites across the entire genome in an unbiased
fashion is valuable. We have created the first such comprehensive maps of candidate regulatory motifs across the
yeast, fly, worm, mouse, and human genomes. The
updated methodology has improved the detection of
experimentally validated motif binding sites and, together
with integration with other data, the generation of regulatory networks and hypotheses. Overlaying and integrating
information from multiple sources, well beyond transcription factor binding motifs and genomic DNA sequences, is
key to building better maps and ultimately to understanding gene regulation on a genome-wide scale.
