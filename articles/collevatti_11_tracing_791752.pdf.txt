Background
The Neotropical Seasonally Dry Forests (SDF) are treedominated ecosystems that occur in disjunct areas of
fertile soils throughout the Neotropics. The hypothesis
that the vicariance of a formerly continuous seasonal
woodland formation, which may have reached its maximum extension during a dry-cool period 18,000–12,000
bp (the LGM), the Pleistocenic Arc Hypothesis, has
been raised to explain the disjunct distribution [1].
Alternatively, based on the distribution of contemporary
SDF species in Amazonia Forest and palynological data,
Pennington [2] also proposed that SDF may have
expanded into Amazonia Basin during the Pleistoce,
with rain forest and montane taxa largely confined to
gallery forest. In addition, a number of studies based on
the fossil pollen record now available show that during
the early Holocene period (until ca. 6000-5000 14C B.
P.), the climate was drier in most of the South American
savannas and distribution of savanna-like vegetation in
Central and Southeast Brazil was more extensive in
early compared with the late Holocene [3-5]. In southeastern Brazil, the current vegetation exist in the region
only in the latest Holocene period (since 970 or 600 B.
P. for some regions) under the current wet climatic conditions, with an annual dry season of about 4 months.
Hence, the fossil record shows that savanna expansion
in the Quaternary, especially in southeastern Brazil was
characterized mainly by herbaceous and grass savanna
which were favored by the drier and highly seasonal climate. It is possible that arboreal savanna taxa became
restricted to sites with moist climatic conditions, which
served as refugias. We are interested in test these

hypotheses using the genus Tabebuia as model group.
We have chosen five species based on the pattern of
geographical distribution: T. aurea and T. ochracea,
from savanna vegetation (cerrado sensu stricto),
T. impetiginosa, T. roseo-alba from SDF, T. serratifolia,
widely distributed in Mata Atlantica, SDF, riparian forests and Amazonia. Here, we present the results based
on the phylogeography of T. impetiginosa.

Methods
We first generated a phylogenetic hypothesis based on
sequences from three non-coding regions of cpDNA
and ITS from nuclear rDNA. At least 16 individuals
from 14 populations were sampled and sequenced for
three chloroplast intergenic spacers (1635bp). We also
sequenced individuals of T. ochracea, T. chrysanta, T.
chrysotricha and Cybstax antisyphilitica, as outgroups to
estimate coalescence time and better understand the
biogeographical history of T. impetiginosa. Time to
most recent common ancestor was estimated based on
coalescent analysis implemented in BEAST 1.4.7 software [6]. For distribution modeling, we used 77 records
of T. impetiginosa and four climatic variables (mean
annual rainfall and variability, average temperature of
the warmest and coldest months) derived from four different coupled Atmosperic-Oceanic Global Circulation
Models (AOGCM): CCSM3, CSIRO, HADCM3 and
ECHAM. Five different niche models were used: the
BIOCLIM , Euclidean Distances (EUCL) Mahalanabis
Distances (MAHAL), Genetic Algorithm for Rule Set
Production (GARP), and Maximum Entropy (MAXENT). For each of the NM, a total of 750 different models were generated, using distinct combinations of
dataset partition and variable selection The paleoclimate
scenarios were based on the GCM Genesis 2 [7].

Results and discussion
We have no evidences of a recent connection of the
SDF in the LGM. Coalescent analyses showed that T.
impetiginosa populations probably originated at ~7 Myr
BP, but populations started to diverge only ~2 Myr BP,
with the divergence of two major clades, one that comprises the populations from the East and West boundaries of Cerrado Biome, and the other that corresponds
to the forests from Central, West and Northeast Brazil.
Major divergences in this last clade coincide with the
Quaternary glaciations. Our results strongly support that
the disjunct distribution of T. impetiginosa may be
derived from vicariance and that long distance gene
flow is unlikely, since we found a deep geneanalogy with
alopatric lineages and a remarkable differentiation
among populations (AMOVA, Arlequin v. 3.11) [8].
Paleodistribution modeling together with coalescent
simulation showed no connection among SDFs in the
LGM. Thus, glaciations may have most likely caused
population divergence and differentiation due to retreat
and range shift of an ancient forest widely distributed
throughout the Central, Southwest and Northeast Brazil.
Hence, we hypothesize that the isolation of an ancient
forest due to a global cooling and drying during the glaciations of Pliocene/Pleistocene is responsible for the
disjunct distribution of the SDF and T. impetiginosa.
Our results also indicated that the last glaciation in
Pleistocene were most likely responsible for local differentiation because lineage diversification within localities
coincides with ~ 100 kya BP but without important
demographic effects because populations showed a constant effective population size and no exponential
growth or shrink. In conclusion, the range shift of T.
impetiginosa toward the Northwest and the lack of a
connection among SDFs in the LGM support the
hypothesis of a kind of SDF in Amazonian Basin during
Pleistocene glaciations but did not support the Pleistocenic Arc Hypothesis.
