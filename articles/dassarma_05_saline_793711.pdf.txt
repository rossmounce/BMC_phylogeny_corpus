Abstract
Saline Systems addresses the publication needs of scientists conducting basic and applied research
on coastal and inland saline environments and their flora and fauna. The journal covers research at
all levels, from individual genes to whole genomes and entire ecosystems. Rapid progress in the
molecular biology and microbial ecology of halotolerant and halophilic organisms and the sensitivity
of many saline environments warrants an online journal with fast turnaround times. Many saline
environments are threatened and the need for an Open Access journal to address the
dissemination and sharing of knowledge on their conservation and management is compelling. Saline
Systems provides an interdisciplinary forum for scientists working within all of the relevant fields.

Saline Systems is being launched to address the publication
needs of researchers exploring all aspects of saline environments. The journal is timely because rapid progress is
being made in the molecular biology, genomics, and ecology of halotolerant and halophilic organisms inhabiting
saline environments [1,2]. The advent of high-throughput
technologies, such as genome sequencing, DNA microarrays, and proteomics, is beginning to revolutionize our
understanding of these complex systems. Genomes of
many halophilic species have already been completely
sequenced and several have been subjected to detailed
bioinformatic, reverse genetic, and transcriptome analyses. Metagenomic and metaproteomic studies are also
yielding insights into the rich metabolic and ecological
diversity of saline ecosystems.
Saline environments, including coastal and inland ecosystems, harbour a substantial fraction of the biodiversity of
the world. These serve as a major source of food for
humankind through commercial fishing and aquaculture.

About 3 billion people live near coastal communities, and
escalating population growth and development are
degrading the habitats critical to biodiversity and threatening the sustained vitality of coastal economies [3]. Estuarine and coastal wetlands are disappearing at an
alarming rate and arable lands are increasingly stressed by
high salinity [4]. Greater understanding of these environments is a prerequisite for protecting both biodiversity
and economic vitality. In order to address these concerns,
better communication is required between scientists
working at all different levels.

Saline Systems: Integration of saline
environments and systems biology
The primary aim of the journal is to enhance communication between and among scientists concerned with saline
environments. Integration is intended to foster a deeper
understanding of these critical environments world-wide,
and of the halophilic and halotolerant organisms which
inhabit them, as well as the underlying fundamental proc-

esses operating in them. Integration of knowledge at various levels is the hallmark of the systems biology
approach. Such an approach permits information from
interdisciplinary studies, from genetics and genomics,
through physiology and biochemistry, to ecology and
environmental biology, to be considered together, and
sets the stage for predictive modelling of systems.
The environments of concern to Saline Systems include
both coastal and inland regions, including natural lakes,
marshes, springs, lagoons, and estuaries, and solar panes
and other evaporitic and arid environments, and also
their diverse micro- and macro-flora and -fauna. Specific
approaches and research areas of interest include (1) the
genomics, molecular biology, and environmental biology
of halophilic and halotolerant organisms; (2) the limnology of salt lakes including microbial ecology, biogeochemical cycling, paleolimnology, and trophic and
ecosystem dynamics; (3) the biodiversity, conservation,
and resource management of saline environments; and
(4) biotechnological applications of saline environments,
including aquaculture.
The expertise of the editorial board of Saline Systems covers
the entire scope of the journal. The editorial board membership includes experts in the chemistry and biology of
saline environments, including general limnology and
biogeography, nutrient cycling, ecological modelling, and
biostatistics, biology, taxonomy and phylogeny of halophilic archaea and bacteria, biology and ecology of halotolerant eukaryotes, including algae, fungi, protists,
invertebrates, and plants, biology of Artemia, crustaceans,
fish, and waterbirds, genomics and postgenomics of
micro- and macroflora and fauna of saline environments,
and aquatic conservation biology.

duce and disseminate the article, provided that it is correctly cited and no errors are introduced [6].
Saline Systems' policy of Open Access is highly beneficial
for science and the general public. Traditional barriers to
accessing research results are removed, resulting in dissemination to the widest possible audience. Authors
become free to reproduce and distribute their work, for
example on their institution's website. Articles are accessible beyond the traditional scientific audiences through
increasingly powerful web search engines, which likely
results in greater citations and higher impact [7,8]. Access
to articles published in Saline Systems is not limited by
library budgets, which are increasingly strained. Research
published in the journal is accessible to all citizens, not
just those with access to a library with a subscription.
Importantly, scientists from resource-poor countries and
institutions, as long as they have a connection to the internet [9], can access articles published in Saline Systems. It is
very likely that our policy of Open Access will contribute
toward levelling the scientific playing field and advance
science.
Another important policy of Saline Systems is that decisions about a manuscript are based solely on the quality
of the work, not on whether the authors' can pay the article-processing charge. A fraction of the papers published
in Saline Systems will have publication fees waived, at the
discretion of the editors. Editors have no financial incentive or competing interest in articles published in the journal, and journal policies are intended primarily to
advance science. We invite the entire community of scientists to contribute to the success of this timely field and its
Open Access journal, Saline Systems.

Saline Systems' policy of Open Access
Saline Systems is an Open Access, online journal publishing high quality manuscripts on all aspects of basic and
applied research on halophilic organisms and saline environments. A wide range of article types are published in
the journal: research, book reviews, database articles,
commentaries, methodology articles, short reports and
reviews. Articles in Saline Systems are submitted and peerreviewed via an online manuscript handling system, and
accepted articles are published online immediately upon
acceptance. In addition to the journal web site, the full
text of each Open Access article is permanently archived in
online repositories separate from the journal, including
PubMed Central [5], the US National Library of Medicine's repository of life science literature. Thus, all articles
published in Saline Systems become universally accessible
online, and so an author's work can be freely read by anyone at no cost. Moreover, the authors hold copyright for
their work, and they may grant anyone the right to repro-
