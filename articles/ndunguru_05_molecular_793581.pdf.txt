Abstract
Cassava is infected by numerous geminiviruses in Africa and India that cause devastating losses to poor
farmers. We here describe the molecular diversity of seven representative cassava mosaic geminiviruses
(CMGs) infecting cassava from multiple locations in Tanzania. We report for the first time the presence
of two isolates in East Africa: (EACMCV-[TZ1] and EACMCV-[TZ7]) of the species East African cassava
mosaic Cameroon virus, originally described in West Africa. The complete nucleotide sequence of
EACMCV-[TZ1] DNA-A and DNA-B components shared a high overall sequence identity to EACMCV[CM] components (92% and 84%). The EACMCV-[TZ1] and -[TZ7] genomic components have
recombinations in the same genome regions reported in EACMCV-[CM], but they also have additional
recombinations in both components. Evidence from sequence analysis suggests that the two strains have
the same ancient origin and are not recent introductions. EACMCV-[TZ1] occurred widely in the
southern part of the country. Four other CMG isolates were identified: two were close to the EACMVKenya strain (named EACMV-[KE/TZT] and EACMV-[KE/TZM] with 96% sequence identity); one isolate,
TZ10, had 98% homology to EACMV-UG2Svr and was named EACMV-UG2 [TZ10]; and finally one isolate
was 95% identical to EACMV-[TZ] and named EACMV-[TZ/YV]. One isolate of African cassava mosaic virus
with 97% sequence identity with other isolates of ACMV was named ACMV-[TZ]. It represents the first
ACMV isolate from Tanzania to be sequenced. The molecular variability of CMGs was also evaluated using
partial B component nucleotide sequences of 13 EACMV isolates from Tanzania. Using the sequences of
all CMGs currently available, we have shown the presence of a number of putative recombination
fragments that are more prominent in all components of EACMV than in ACMV. This new knowledge
about the molecular CMG diversity in East Africa, and in Tanzania in particular, has led us to hypothesize
about the probable importance of this part of Africa as a source of diversity and evolutionary change both
during the early stages of the relationship between CMGs and cassava and in more recent times. The
existence of multiple CMG isolates with high DNA genome diversity in Tanzania and the molecular forces
behind this diversity pose a threat to cassava production throughout the African continent.

Background
Geminiviruses are a large family of plant viruses with circular, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) genomes packaged
within geminate particles. The family Geminiviridae is
divided into four genera (Mastrevirus, Curtovirus, Topocuvirus, and Begomovirus) according to their genome organizations and biological properties [1,2]. Members of the
genus Begomovirus have caused significant yield losses in
many crops worldwide [3] and are transmitted by whiteflies (Bemisia tabaci) to dicotyledonous plants. The
genome of cassava mosaic geminiviruses (CMGs) in the
genus Begomovirus consists of two DNA molecules, DNAA and DNA-B, each of about 2.8 kbp [1], which are
responsible for different functions in the infection process. DNA-A encodes genes responsible for viral replication
[AC1 (Rep), and AC3 (Ren)], regulation of gene expression
[AC2 (Trap)] and particle encapsidation [AV1 (CP)].
DNA-B encodes for two proteins, BC1 (MP) and BV1
(NSP) involved in cell-to-cell movement within the plant,
host range and symptom modulation [1]. CMGs have
been reported from many cassava-growing countries in
Africa and the cassava mosaic disease (CMD) induced by
them constitutes a formidable threat to cassava production [4].
Representatives of six distinct CMG species have been
found to infect cassava in Africa: African cassava mosaic
virus (ACMV), East African cassava mosaic virus (EACMV),
East African cassava mosaic Cameroon virus (EACMCV), East
African cassava mosaic Malawi virus (EACMMV), East African cassava mosaic Zanzibar virus (EACMZV) and South
African cassava mosaic virus (SACMV) [5]. Recent studies
have uncovered much variation in CMGs including evidence that certain CMGs, when present in mixtures,
employ pseudo-recombination or reassortment strategies
and recombination at certain hot spots such as the origin
of replication [6-10] resulting in the emergence of 'new'
viruses with altered virulence. For instance, an ACMVEACMV recombinant component A, designated EACMVUG2, and a pseudo-recombinant component B, designated EACMV-UG3 [10], have been implicated in the pandemic of severe CMD currently devastating cassava in
much of east and central Africa [4]. In 1997, only ACMV
and EACMV were known to occur in Tanzania with the
former occurring only in the western part of the country
[11]. The discovery of EACMZV on the island of Zanzibar
[12] together with the recent spread into Tanzania of the
EACMV-UG2 associated pandemic of severe CMD [4,13]
has aggravated the CMD situation. Consequently, there is
much to be learned about the identity, distribution,
molecular variability, and the threat that these emerging
geminiviruses pose to cassava production in Tanzania and
more generally in Africa.

http://www.virologyj.com/content/2/1/21

In 1997, the first recombination between two species of
geminiviruses was recorded [7,8]. This mechanism is now
known to be widely used by all geminiviruses and is probably the most important molecular mechanism for generating genetic changes that allow novel geminiviruses to
exploit new ecological niches [2,14].
This paper describes the results of a molecular study of the
sequences of CMGs collected from the major cassavagrowing areas of Tanzania in an effort towards identifying,
determining molecular variability and mapping the distribution of CMGs. In addition, because East Africa seems to
be unusually rich in virus biodiversity and because the
most recent cassava pandemic was first reported in East
Africa, we investigated the extent of inter-CMG recombinations and examined their role in the evolution of CMGs
in Africa.

Results
Assessment of CMD symptoms
Over 80% of the cassava plants in the fields showed severe
CMD symptoms with cassava in the Lake Victoria basin
expressing the most severe symptoms followed by that
from the southern regions. Symptoms of infected cassava
samples collected in the field were reproduced in controlled conditions to examine symptom variability. From a
total of 35 selected cuttings planted, 25 (71%) were successfully established in the growth chamber. In all cases,
regardless of the cultivar, symptoms expressed in the field,
whether moderate or severe, were reproduced in the
growth chamber and plants did not recover from the disease even 12 months after planting (Fig. 2). Likewise,
plants that displayed moderate symptoms in the field
showed a similar symptom in the growth chamber as was
the case for plants singly-infected with ACMV-[TZ] (Fig.
2).
Detection of viral genomic components
PCR amplification products (2.7–2.8 kbp) were observed
for all the CMG isolates tested using primer UNIF/UNIR
(Table 1) designed to amplify near-full-length DNA-A of
CMGs. Bands were not observed with the negative control
(nucleic acid preparation from healthy cassava plants).
Similarly, a specific (2.7 kbp) product was observed when
using abutting primers TZ1B-F/R designed from a 560 bp
DNA-B fragment initially PCR-amplified using universal
primers EAB555/F and EAB555R for general detection of
CMGs DNA-B. DNA-B partial fragments (544–560 kbp)
were consistently amplified by PCR using primers
EAB555-F and EAB555-R (Table 1) for all the CMD-diseased samples previously shown to contain EACMV isolates collected from major cassava-growing areas in
Tanzania [13].

Complete nucleotide sequence characteristics of CMGs
from Tanzania
The complete DNA-A sequences of seven representative
CMGs from the major cassava-growing areas were determined from the representative isolates selected and grown
in the growth chambers. An ACMV isolate from Tanzania
(ACMV-[TZ]) was shown to be most closely related to
ACMV-UGMld from Uganda with a sequence identity of
97%. Its DNA-A nucleotide (nt) sequence was established
to be 2779 nts in length. It has a high overall sequence
identity (> 90%) with all other published sequences of
ACMV isolates (Table 2) with which it clusters in the phylogenetic tree presented in Figure 3. The DNA-A sequence
organization was typical of a begomovirus, with two open
reading frames (ORFs) (AV2 and AV1) in the virion-sense
DNA, and four ORFs (AC1 to AC4) in the complementary
sense, separated by an intergenic region (IR). Complete nt
sequences of the DNA-A genomes of the different Tanzanian EACMV and ACMV isolates were compared with
published sequences (Table 2).

Two isolates, TZ1 and TZ7, with 2798 and 2799 nts
respectively, collected from Mbinga district in southwest-

ern Tanzania, were most closely related to isolates of the
species East African cassava mosaic Cameroon virus from
Cameroon and Ivory Coast, West Africa, (EACMCV-[CM],
-[CI]), with 89–90% nt sequence identity. They are clearly
isolates of EACMCV and we have named them EACMCV[TZ1] and EACMCV-[TZ7] to indicate that they were from
Tanzania and to distinguish them from the original EACMCV-[CM] isolate from Cameroon. The two isolates were
also virtually identical to one another having high overall
DNA sequence conservation (93% nt sequence identity).
Phylogenetic analysis of the DNA-A nt sequences grouped
EACMCV-[TZ1] and EACMCV-[TZ7] in the same cluster
with EACMCV-[CM] and EACMCV-[CI] (Fig. 3). The complete nt sequence of the EACMCV-[TZ1] DNA-B component was determined to be 2726 nts long and had the
highest sequence identity (85%) with EACMCV-[CM]
DNA-B with which it is grouped in the phylogenetic tree
(Fig. 4). It had less than 72% homology with DNA-Bs of
other EACMV isolates from East Africa.
The complete DNA-A genome of CMG isolates from
Yombo Vituka (YV) and Tanga (TZT) in the coastal area of
Tanzania were determined to be 2800 and 2801 nts long

respectively. Isolate YV showed high (95%) overall nt
sequence identity with previously characterized EACMV[TZ] and is therefore named EACMV-[TZ/YV] in the Dares-Salaam region. It also had high overall sequence identity (87–96%) with other Tanzanian EACMV isolates
characterized in this study (Table 2). Phylogenetic analysis of the complete nt sequence of EACMV-[TZ/YV]
grouped it with its closest relative, EACMV-TZ (Fig. 3).
CMG isolate TZT had high sequence identity (96.5%)
with EACMV-[KE/K2B] from Kenya and is named
EACMV-[KE/TZT]. Similarly, another CMG isolate (TZM)
from the Mara region in the Lake Victoria zone was found

to have high overall sequence identity (96%) with
EACMV-[KE/K2B] and we have named it EACMV-[KE/
TZM]. This isolate, 2805 nts in length, together with
EACMV-[KE/TZT], clustered with EACMV-[KE/K2B] in the
phylogenetic tree (Fig. 3). Another isolate from Kagera
region in northwestern Tanzania (TZ10) showed very
high overall DNA-A nt sequence identity (98.8%) with the
published sequence of EACMV-UG2Svr. Its complete
DNA-A nt sequence was 2804 nts long and it was named
EACMV-UG2 [TZ10].

Determination of genetic diversity of EACMV DNA-B using
partial sequences
The diversity of different CMG isolates was analyzed using
a partial DNA-B genomic region spanning the N-terminal
region of BC1 to the intergenic region (IR). Identities of
these sequences with those of the corresponding DNA-B
genomic regions of other CMGs in GenBank were determined. Generally, the EACMV isolates showed little
genetic divergence amongst one another and isolates collected from the same area displayed high nt sequence
identity. Isolates TZB1 and TZB7 from the southern part
of Tanzania shared the highest (98%) nt sequence identity
followed by TZB3 and TZB8 (94%) as well as TZB and
TZB10, all from the east coast area. TZB2 was most closely
related to and shared 91% sequence identity with TZB4,
both collected from the coastal area. None of the isolates
from the south or coastal areas shared >85% nt sequence

identity with those from the Lake Victoria basin (TZB9
and TZB12).
The phylogenetic tree generated from a multiple alignment of 13 EACMV isolates with selected bipartite begomovirus sequences and EACMCV-[TZ1] B component is
shown in Figure 4. All 13 Tanzanian isolates studied clustered with the reference EACMVs, with TZB6 being most
closely related to Ugandan isolates (EACMV-UG3Svr,
EACMV-UG3Mld and EACMV-UG1) (Fig. 4) sharing 97%
nt sequence identity. Four isolates (TZB3, TZB5, TZB8 and
TZB9) formed a closely related group, with TZB8 and
TZB9 being the most closely related. Isolates TZMB, TZB5
and TZB11 each grouped separately. None of the EACMV
isolates grouped with ICMV and SLCMV from the Indian
subcontinent (Fig. 4).

Capsid protein (CP) gene sequence analysis and
comparison with selected viruses
The CP gene sequences of the seven CMGs identified in
our study were compared to published sequences (Table
3). ACMV-[TZ] shared the highest nt sequence identity
(97.4%) with ACMV-UGMld from Uganda followed by
ACMV-[CM], an isolate from Cameroon. The lowest
sequence identity (63.2%) was recorded with TGMV-YV
(Table 3), an American begomovirus. Both EACMCV[TZ1] and EACMCV-[TZ7] were more than 92% identical
to EACMCV-[CM], but they also had very high nt
sequence identity (95%) with EACMZV from Zanzibar
and EACMV-[KE/K2B] (Table 3) and 96% between each
other. Interestingly, EACMV-[KE/TZT] and EACMV-[KE/
TZM] collectively shared high (97%) identity with
EACMZV followed by EACMV-[KE/K2B](96–97%) and
up to 96% between each other. Furthermore the EACMV[TZ/YV] CP gene sequence showed very high identity with
EACMV-[TZ] (96%) and EACMZV (96%) followed by
EACMV-[KE/K2B](95%) (Table 3). The EACMV-UG2
[TZ10] sequence shared a very high nt sequence identity
(99%) with EACMV-UG2Svr from Uganda and high identity (98–99%) with other Ugandan isolates of EACMV. As
expected, EACMV-UG2 [TZ10] shared 90% sequence
homology with ACMV (Table 3), suggesting it contained
the recombination at the CP gene level previously
reported [7,8] for EACMV-UG2.

A phylogenetic analysis of the CP of Tanzanian CMGs
yielded a tree (Fig. 5) that was in agreement with the relationship predicted by pairwise sequence comparison
(Table 4). ACMV-[TZ] clustered with other ACMV isolates
while EACMV-UG2 [TZ10] grouped with Ugandan isolates of EACMV. EACMCV-[TZ1], EACMCV-[TZ7],
EACMV-[TZ/YV], and the two viruses, EACMV-[KE/TZT]
and EACMV-[KE/TZM] clustered with other EACMV isolates from either Cameroon or Kenya. No CMG isolate
identified in this study clustered with EACMMV from
Malawi, SACMV from South Africa, ICMV, or SLCMV
from the Indian sub-continent when their CP gene nucleotide sequences were compared (Fig. 5).
The common regions (CRs) of the Tanzanian CMGs
The conserved nonanucleotide in the hairpin-loop,
TAATATTAC, that is characteristic of the members of the
family Geminiviridae and the AC1 TATA box, were identified in the CR sequences of all the Tanzanian CMGs (Fig.
6a,6b). The CR of ACMV-[TZ] was 170 nts long while
those for EACMV were between 152 and 157 nts in length.
When the CR sequence of ACMV-[TZ] was compared and
aligned to the published CR sequences of other cassavainfecting ACMV isolates from Africa (Fig. 6a), it was
apparent that ACMV-[TZ] was virtually identical to all
ACMV isolates. The repeated motif upstream the TATA
box for all the published ACMV isolates was AATTGGAGA

http://www.virologyj.com/content/2/1/21

(Fig. 6a). The motif for ACMV-[TZ], AATTGGAGA, was
identical. Figure 6b presents the alignment of the CRs of
the Tanzanian EACMVs with sequences of all published
EACMVs. It was found that all the isolates contained the
various features characteristic of begomoviruses. The
putative Rep-binding sequences (iterons) were GGTGGAATGGGGG for all the Tanzanian isolates except
EACMV-[TZ/YV]
that
had
different
iterons
(GGGGGAACGGGGG) and a total of 23 mismatches in
the entire CR. It is worth noting that although the
genomes of the two isolates of EACMZV are EACMVbased, their CRs are more similar to ACMV than to
EACMV and the iteron is AATTGGAGA.
The comparisons of the nt sequences of the CRs of Tanzanian CMGs with other CMGs revealed high sequence
identity (> 90%) of ACMV-[TZ] to published sequences of
other ACMV isolates and low identity (61–62%) to
EACMV species. Similarly, all the Tanzanian EACMV isolates were related with sequence identities of 83–97%
between CRs of the DNA-A and DNA-B. The CR of
EACMV-[TZ/YV] showed a relatively low sequence identity to other isolates. EACMCV-[TZ1] (DNA-A and -B) and
the EACMCV-[TZ7] showed high nt sequence identity to
EACMCV (Table 4).
Geographical distribution of the CMGs in Tanzania
The representative isolates sequenced here have been chosen because they represent a range of different RFLP patterns found during a large set of 485 samples collected
throughout Tanzania [13]. However, the selection of isolates to sequence was based on the differences in RFLP
patterns and not on their frequency of appearance in the
country. Figure 7 shows the different locations of these
samples represented by the isolates sequenced here. The
EACMCV-[TZ1] was the most widespread, found in 50
samples located mainly in the southern part of Tanzania
in the Mbinga District of Ruvuma Region. EACMCV[TZ7], the close relative of EACMCV-[TZ1], was found
only in one sample in the same district of Mbinga.
EACMV-[KE/TZT] was found only in the coastal areas, in
ten samples, mainly in Tanga and Pwani regions. EACMV[KE/TZM] was found in ten samples, only in the Mara
Region of the Lake Victoria Basin and to a very limited
extent on the island of Ukerewe in Lake Victoria. The rest
of the CMGs, EACMV-UG2 [TZ10], ACMV-[TZ] as well as
EACMV-[TZ/YV], had a limited geographical distribution
(Fig. 7).

virus. The A component was 89 to 90% identical to the isolates from Cameroon and Ivory Coast and the 300 nts that
differ are scattered all along the genome. In addition, the
A components from East Africa showed the typical recombination already noted in the West African isolates, i.e. a
fragment of about 800 nts not of EACMV origin, covering
AC2-AC3 and the C-terminus of AC1 (Fig. 8A).
ii) Comparisons of the B components of EACMCV
The EACMCV West African isolates had only a stretch of
800 nts in the BC1 region in common with EACMV isolates from Uganda, the only B component available for
EACMV: the rest of the sequence was completely different.
The DNA-B of the East African EACMV isolates is ± 85%
homologous to the West African isolates. The pairwise
profile (Fig. 8B) showed the same recombinant fragment
of about 800 nts with above 90% identity with West African isolates of EACMCV and other East African isolates
such as EACMV-UG3, EACMZV and SACMV. The rest of
the genome showed greater relatedness to the West African isolates of EACMCV, above the "species threshold"
limit. Overall, the EACMCV-[TZ1] B component can be
considered a non-closely related strain of the B component of EACMCV-[CM], but much closer than the B components of other East African cassava viruses.
iii) Comparisons of the common regions (CRs) of EACMCVs from
Cameroon and Tanzania
The common region of A components (CRAs) were 82%
to 89% identical to those of West African isolates, which
is low but not abnormal as the West African isolates were
91% identical to one another (Table 4). The differences
are mostly in the variable region between the TATA box
and the TAATATTAC stem-loop, but also in the rest of the
sequence. The CR of B components (CRBs) of the EAC-

***

MCV-[TZ1] isolate was more distantly related, at between
78% and 80% homology to the CRBs of the West African
isolates, while they were 97% homologous to one
another. The differences were mostly in the variable
region. When both (CRAs and CRBs) were compared, it
was apparent that CRs of the East African isolates were
more similar to the CRAs of West Africa than the CRBs of
West Africa. This arises mainly from a deletion of GAAAA,
and from a more similar sequence in the region between
the TATA box and the stem-loop. The putative replication
protein binding sequences (iterons) were GGTGG-AATGGGGG for all the isolates except for the Bs of West Africa
where it is GGTGG-AAC-GGGGG. There is a repeat of
GGGGG in the 5' end of the CRs for all the isolates (Fig.
6B).
Recombination analysis of cassava mosaic geminiviruses
The pairwise analysis performed on all African cassava
viruses sequenced so far, with two Indian cassava viruses
as out-groups, and including the viruses isolated in Tanzania (here described), showed a number of putative recombinant fragments for both components. Figure 9 shows a
genomic map for each component and summarizes the
results obtained for the A and B components.
i) Pairwise analysis of the A components
African cassava mosaic virus
None of the ACMV sequences obtained so far exhibited a
possible recombinant fragment. An isolate of ACMV was
involved in a recombination between EACMV and ACMV
to produce the EACMV-UG2 isolate, which was associated
with the epidemic in Uganda in the 90s [7,8]. But it is
worth noting that ACMV acted as a donor of DNA, not a
receiver, in the recombination. The situation for the
EACMV-like viruses is very different, as they exhibit mul-

tiple putative recombinations between themselves and
also unknown viruses. The A components of all the
viruses in East Africa share a common backbone from
EACMV and have integrated other pieces of DNA that
have been said to originate from the other viruses not
identified so far.
East African cassava mosaic Zanzibar virus
Two isolates of EACMZV from Zanzibar and Kenya [12]
have most of their genomes from EACMV; approximately
200 nts (2050 to 2250 nts) are similar to SACMV and the
rest of the genome, covering AC1, AC4 and the CR, is
unique and therefore attributed to EACMZV or an ancestor of EACMZV (Fig. 9A).

East African cassava mosaic Cameroon virus
Several EACMCV isolates from Cameroon, Ivory Coast
and now Tanzania (this report) belong to the species East
African cassava mosaic Cameroon virus (see paragraph 3.6;
[9]); all share the same putative recombinant fragment,
i.e. a fragment of 800 nts (AC3-AC2-CterAC1), that is
unique and therefore attributed to EACMCV (Fig. 9A) or a
common ancestor. However, the three isolates from West
Africa do have a small recombinant fragment (100–250
nts) that is also unique to EACMCV, but this fragment is
not present in the Tanzanian isolates.

[15] show a similar recombination pattern. The first 1000
nts have either a similar pattern as SACMV-[M12] and
SACMV-[ZW] or share two fragments of 100 and 750 nts
with the SACMV-[ZA] isolate from South Africa (Fig. 9A).
The fragments 550–800 and 900–1050 nts are therefore
attributed to EACMMV or an ancestor. The major difference with the SACMV isolates resides in the fact that the
rest of the genome is purely EACMV-like, with the exception of 100 nts in the AC1 gene (1950–2050 nts).
South African cassava mosaic virus
One virus isolate of the species South African cassava mosaic
virus from South Africa (SACMV-[ZA]) [16] exhibited a
putative recombination, i.e. most of the first 1000 nts
(CR, AV2 and most of AV1) and then the last 800 nts
(NterAC1, AC4 and CR) are unique for this virus and con-

sequently attributed to SACMV, or an ancestor of SACMV.
The rest of the genome, covering AC3-AC2 and the C-terminus of AC1, is typical of EACMV (Fig. 9A). Another two
isolates of SACMV, one from Madagascar (SACMV[M12]) and one from Zimbabwe (SACMV-[ZW]),
although belonging to the same species as the virus from
South Africa, have a different recombination pattern, i.e.
the first 1050 nts are similar to EACMMV with portions
that are SACMV-type and portions that are EACMMV-type
(Fig. 9).
The SLCMV-[Col] and ICMV-[Mah] isolates, here used as
out-groups [17], exhibited a large recombinant fragment
of 1200 nts, possibly originating from ICMV [18] and
encompassing NterAC1, AC4 and all the CR.

Noticeably, several recombination sites are aligned
among the different genomes, possibly indicating "hot

fragments in which variation led to selective evolutionary
advantage.

ii) Pairwise analysis of the B Components
The B components of CMGs also showed the presence of
putative recombinant fragments as determined by the
pairwise analysis. Unfortunately, some B components,
such as those of EACMV-[TZ], EACMMV-[K] and -[MH],

Virology Journal 2005, 2:21

have not been cloned yet and therefore we have only
partial information. The ACMV B sequences available did
not show any recombination. The EACMCV isolates from
Cameroon, Ivory Coast and Tanzania all showed the same
putative recombinant fragment, i.e. between 1700 and
2300 nts, corresponding to part of the BC1 gene.
Interestingly, and a contrario to the EACMCV A component, most of the B genome is unique and only the recombinant fragment originates from EACMV (Fig. 9B); the rest
of the genome is therefore marked as the EACMCV-type
(Fig. 9B). Furthermore, a comparison of the B components of the EACMCV isolates from Cameroon or Ivory
Coast with the sequence from Tanzania shows between
250 and 1700 nts and between 2350 and 2800 nts, a
different sequence, indicating either another two
recombinations with another unknown virus or viruses,
or, as supported by the number of point mutations, an
extremely old sequence compared to the West African isolates of EACMCV (Fig. 9B); therefore it is marked EACMCV-[TZ]. On the contrary, the partial sequence of the B
component of an isolate from Zanzibar (EACMZV-[ZB])
showed almost complete identity with a B component
from EACMV-UG3, with a very short EACMZV-type fragment of 150 nts at the end of the genome. Similarly, the
sole isolate of a B component of SACMV-[ZA] was almost
entirely identical to EACMV-UG3, with a 500 nts fragment
SACMV-type (1700 – 2300 nts), mostly corresponding to
a non-coding fragment of the virus. ICMV and SLCMV B
components, here used as out-groups, were essentially
identical with the exception of 200 nts covering the CR of
SLCMV and justifying the claim that the SLCMV A component captured the B component of ICMV [17].
Quantification of the percentage of EACMV-type and
SACMV-type sequences in each virus
From the recombination analysis and phylogenetic
results, it is clear that all EACMV-like viruses share a portion of the EACMV backbone sequence. The recombination map was used to calculate these percentages,
indicated in Figure 9 for each component. This percentage
varies from 38 to 100% depending on each virus for the A
components and from 22 to 100% for the B components.
A similar calculation can be made for sequences that are
SACMV-type and the results vary between 0 and 60% for
the A components and from 0 to 16% for the B components (Fig. 9). Figure 11 shows a repartition of these percentages according to the different viruses cloned and
according to a transect between Uganda and South Africa,
indicating that the EACMV backbone sequence decreases
towards South Africa while the SACMV-type sequence
increases.

Discussion
The present study confirmed the presence of representatives of 3 species of CMGs in Tanzania: one isolate of

http://www.virologyj.com/content/2/1/21

ACMV, four isolates of EACMV, and two additional isolates of EACMCV. The complete DNA-A nucleotide
sequences of these isolates were determined.
ACMV
It is apparent from the results of this study that several
CMGs exist in Tanzania showing a high genetic diversity.
The ACMV characterized from Tanzania was found to
have very high overall DNA-A nt sequence identity to all
the other isolates of ACMV sequenced so far. As there is no
relation between the origin of ACMV isolates and their
sequence relationship with other isolates, it is impossible
to tell if the one found in Tanzania is more related to one
ACMV isolate than another. As it is the first isolate to be
sequenced from Tanzania, we named it ACMV-[TZ]. This
virus, like all the other ACMVs, displayed no detectable
recombination in its DNA-A genome.
EACMCV
EACMCV-[TZ1] and EACMCV-[TZ7] had high overall
DNA-A nt sequence identities, as well as high CP and CR
sequence identity to members of the species EACMCV
from West Africa, confirming their relatedness to that species. The two isolates from Tanzania are about 8% different, while each of them is more than 10% different to any
of the West African isolates. The two Cameroonian isolates are very close to one another (>99%) and about 3–
4% different from the Ivorian isolate. In addition, the Tanzanian viruses showed the same recombination, relative
to EACMV-type sequences, as the EACMCVs from Cameroon and Ivory Coast, covering the C-TerAC1-AC2-AC3
region. However, we noted that the Tanzanian isolates
have lost or never acquired a small recombinant sequence
at the beginning of the genome, as present in the West
African isolates. The EACMCV-[TZ1] B component
showed the same recombination as the EACMCV-[CM]
and EACMCV-[CI] B components, covering part of the
BC1 region. However, the EACMCV-[TZ1] B component
had an additional two putative recombinant fragments
(250–1700 nts and 2350–2800 nts) not present in the
West African isolates. Considering the overall sequence
identity of both components, the fact that sequence differences are scattered all along their genomes and the fact
that there are differences in patterns of recombination, it
is strongly suggested that the two sets of viruses from East
and West Africa have been separated for a very long time
and are not the result of a recent introduction in either
direction. One recombination in DNA-A and one in DNAB, as they are identical, pre-date their separation, though
it is not possible at this stage to date the separation. EACMCV-[TZ1] occurred widely in southern Tanzania, being
present in over 98% of CMD-diseased samples collected
from the southwestern part of Tanzania in the Ruvuma
Region close to Lake Malawi in the same area where EACMCV-[TZ7] was found. The fact that the two sequences in

identified in different parts of Africa, either from this study or from GenBank accessions. The significance of the color codes is
given in the figure. Where the component B of a particular virus has not been cloned, it is indicated in letters for a different
species representative or as a faded drawing for a different isolate. For simplification of the drawing, not all the ACMV isolates
have been shown as they are very similar. Similarly, the EACMV-UGs associated with the CMD pandemic now present in several central African countries have not been depicted as they are of very recent introduction (less than 10 years). The solid
blue arrows represent the possible "route" of evolution of the EACMCV viruses, and the green arrows represent the possible
"route" of evolution of the EACMV viruses.

Tanzania show from two to three times more sequence
variability and two extra recombinant fragments, together
with the fact that the parent EACMV has not been found
so far in West Africa, suggests an East African origin of this
virus species, and therefore a possible spread from the East
to the West as indicated in Figure 10.
EACMV-TZ, -KE, -UG
The rest of the CMGs cloned in this study were closely
related to those reported in the neighboring countries of

Uganda, Kenya or the previously characterized Tanzanian
isolate of EACMV. These were EACMV-[TZ/YV], which
resembled the EACMV-[TZ] characterized previously [19],
and EACMV-[KE/TZT] that showed high sequence identity
with EACMV-[KE/K2B] from Kenya, on the basis of their
overall DNA-A nt sequences. While the CP of EACMV[TZ/YV] showed high sequence identity with EACMV-[TZ]
and EACMZV-[ZB] from the island of Zanzibar [12],
EACMV-[KE/TZT] from Tanga region showed high nt
sequence identity with its close relative EACMV-[KE/K2B].

Similarly, EACMV-[KE/TZM] also shared high CP nt
sequence identity with EACMZV-[ZB]. It was found in
only ten samples and very localized in spread within the
region. Plants singly-infected with EACMV-[KE/TZM]
expressed very severe symptoms both in the field and
growth chamber. Whether this phenotype was a result of
the nature of the EACMV-[KE/TZM] DNA-A genome
remains to be established. The EACMV-UG2 [TZ10]
shared very high DNA-A and CR sequence identity with
EACMV-UG2Svr from Uganda. The CR also showed 100%
nt sequence identity with EACMV-UG2Svr as well as high
CP sequence identity to ACMV isolates because it has the
same recombination as its closest relative, EACMVUG2Svr, that was proven to involve two viruses (ACMV
and EACMV) [7,8]. This CMG was localized in the northwestern part of Tanzania in the post-epidemic area. It is
noticeable that this virus, which has invaded a large
portion of Central Africa in just a few years [4] (Fig. 8), has
not yet reached the southern and eastern part of Tanzania.
Recombination of A and B components
Using all the CMG sequences available so far, we have
shown that both A and B components of most of the
CMGs exhibit putative recombinant fragments from various known or unknown origins. Despite the smaller
number of sequences of DNA-B components and the
smaller number of putative recombinant fragments, it is
interesting to note that, as for the A components, it seems
that there are "hot spots" for recombination. These apparent hotspots for recombination could result from physical
constraints in the virus sequences or could simply result
from the functional constraints of having recombinant
proteins that keep structural and biological functions.
These hotspots have already been mentioned in other
general studies of geminivirus recombination [14] as well
as in specific studies of particular groups of geminiviruses
[20].
Two categories of CMGs in Africa
Based on recombination analyses, it is apparent that there
are really two different categories of CMGs. The ACMV
group does not have fragments of foreign geminivirus
DNA in their genomes. By contrast, all other African CMG
species groups show evidence of extensive recombination.
It is also significant that EACMCV isolates obtained from
each side of the African continent appear to share a similar
genetic make-up and recombination pattern. This suggests
that these viruses had a common origin, probably in East
Africa, but diverged a long time ago. Recombination
events have been shown to be key factors in the development of CMD epidemics [7,8,19] and it has been
suggested that recombination is a significant contributor
to geminivirus evolution [14]. Recombination involving
the CP sequence has been reported for EACMV-UG2 from
Uganda [7,8,10], a virus that has been associated with the

http://www.virologyj.com/content/2/1/21

current CMD pandemic that has devastated cassava in
eastern and central African countries [4,21], although
there is currently no proof that this event has been the key
factor driving the pandemic's spread.
B components of CMGs in Tanzania
The diversity of DNA-B components of EACMV from Tanzania was investigated using partial DNA-B nt sequences
(BC1-CR) of ~560 bp. Generally, there was little genetic
divergence among the compared isolates with the exception of TZB6 that shared 97% sequence identity to
EACMV-UG1 (AF230375) and 96% with EACMV-UG3
from Uganda. Isolate TZB1 and TZB7 clustered with EACMCV-TZ1 and are probably Bs of EACMCV A
components. However, for the other isolates that grouped
or formed their own group in the phylogenetic analysis, it
was difficult to speculate as to what they represent partly
because the DNA-Bs of EACMV-[TZ], EACMV-[KE] and
EACMMV have yet to be sequenced. However, these short
fragments indicated a clustering, apart from EACMV-UG
and EACMCV, into 4 additional clusters that could reflect
an even greater molecular diversity in the B components
of CMGs in East Africa than we currently recognize.
EACMV evolution
The clustering of all the EACMV-like viruses into one species has been the topic of much scientific debate in recent
years. ICTV (International Committee on Taxonomy of
Viruses) finally decided to split them into 5 species (for
now), mostly to comply with the ICTV guidelines for
species demarcation, but clearly these viruses are closely
related and had common ancestors. All EACMV-like
viruses with the exception of EACMCV occur in East
Africa, and mostly east of the Rift Valley. Evidence presented here and elsewhere now provides a strong case for
an East African origin for the EACMVs. EACMCV is
widely-distributed across West Africa, albeit at low incidence [4]. Whilst it seems likely that this is the result of an
early introduction or introductions from East Africa, it is
not currently clear when such an introduction(s) might
have taken place. It is even possible that the spread of this
virus occurred in another host, long before cassava was
introduced into Africa.

Finally, the rapidly expanding EACMV-UG2 associated
pandemic of severe CMD in East and Central Africa
represents a contrasting, and currently probably unique,
scenario in which the combination of a virulent recombinant virus, superabundant vector populations and susceptible local cassava germplasm have led to a rapid
expansion in the geographic range of EACMV-UG with a
concomitant devastating impact on cassava cultivation.
Furthermore, it is significant that when considering the
proportion of pure EACMV backbone sequences in the A
components of all the EACMV-like viruses, there is a clear

Page 19 of 23

Virology Journal 2005, 2:21

gradient from East Africa to South Africa, going from 100
to 38%, suggesting firstly that these viruses are highly
related and secondly that the origin of the EACMVs might
have been East Africa, hence the green arrows in Figures 8
and 11. Similarly, a reverse gradient for the SACMV-like
sequence, going from 8 to 60% from Zanzibar to South
Africa, suggests that the SACMV ancestor was located in
South Africa. Because recombination can only occur when
the two parent viruses are in the same plant, it is logical to
expect a spatial relation between the different viruses and
their genetic make up. It is, however, the first time that
such gradients have been demonstrated for geminiviruses.
The situation for the B components is completely different. There is no EACMV-like gradient from North to
South, as most of the available sequences show a great
proportion of EACMV-like sequences. However, it is evident that EACMCV has captured a B component completely different from EACMV, with only a small EACMVlike fragment. This result is concordant with the idea that
B components can be recruited independently from the
genetic nature of A components as already suggested for
SLCMV and ICMV [17].
East Africa
East Africa has been the cradle for many biological organisms beginning with humanity. From this work, it is also
apparent that Tanzania may also be a potential source of
origin of the family of EACMVs. The revealed strain diversity further exemplifies the wealth of this part of Africa
with respect to cassava geminiviruses. Some of these
viruses have been introduced very recently, such as
EACMV-UG2 [TZ10], while others, such as ACMV and the
EACMVs, have clearly been present much longer. The
East-African Arc Mountain is known to be the main biodiversity hot-spot in Africa, and an important refuge for
plants and animals [22], therefore it is plausible that some
of the geminiviruses that were invading local host plants
were spread throughout Africa in their local hosts (for
many millions of years), as it was suggested for Rice yellow
mottle virus [23] colonizing the domesticated host in very
recent history (a few hundred years). The same type of
geminiviruses would have colonized cassava wherever
they might be, beginning with that crop's introduction
into the African continent in the XVIth century, as these
viruses would have had the same potential for such colonization. This might have been the case for EACMCV for
which our data presented here suggest an old East African
origin for the now widely distributed EACMCV in West
Africa. In addition to this scenario, it is certain that cassava
geminiviruses have been exchanged throughout the
movement of virus infected cassava cuttings via human
intervention and by the natural vector Bemisia tabaci. The
latter may account for the EACMV/SACMV gradient
between East Africa and South Africa, favoured by a natural corridor along the eastern Rift Valley and created by the

http://www.virologyj.com/content/2/1/21

recombination capacity of CMGs present in the same
region.
However, more sequences are required in order to compare and contrast variability within and between the virus
populations and to strengthen the understanding of their
evolutionary interrelationships. The rapid spread of the
EACMV-UG2 associated pandemic has been driven
through superabundant whitefly populations [24], but
other important forces in CMG movement and evolution
include movement of cassava cuttings and transmission
from and into alternative weed hosts. Although cassava
was brought to Africa in the XVIth century, it attained its
current Africa-wide distribution as recently as the XIXth
century. Most current movement occurs informally as
farmers move cuttings locally. Wider distribution is less
frequent but may be more significant in enabling major
displacements of CMGs, such as that hypothesized for the
introduction of EACMCV from East to West Africa.
Although rapid spread of up to 100 km per year has been
reported for the EACMV-UG associated pandemic [4],
elsewhere there appears to be much less local spread of
CMGs by whitefly, and physical barriers including lakes,
forests and regions where cassava is not grown, appear to
be effective in curtailing local spread of CMG. This would
seem to account for the apparent 'island' of EACMCV in
southern Tanzania as well as the absence of ACMV from
coastal East Africa.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we have established the existence of different CMG isolates, strains and species in Tanzania with
some isolates resembling those reported previously in
East African countries and two isolates very similar to the
geographically distant EACMCV from West Africa. This
study demonstrates that East Africa is rich in CMGs and
could be the cradle for CMG diversification in Africa. It
also highlights the urgent need for more information.
Only through building a thorough understanding of these
important plant pathogens and the evolutionary processes underpinning their emergence can we hope to
develop effective and sustainable approaches to managing
the disease they cause.

Methods
Collection of plant samples
A total of 510 samples were collected during September
2002 from the northeastern coast (60), east coast (74),
southeastern coast (68), southern region (70) and the
Lake Victoria Basin (238), representing the major cassavagrowing areas in Tanzania. Cassava leaf samples and cuttings (25–30 cm in length) were collected from plants
expressing CMD symptoms in fields located at a minimum of 5 km intervals. Leaf samples were kept in a cool
box for DNA processing. Selected cassava cuttings were

Page 20 of 23

Virology Journal 2005, 2:21

transported to the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center,
St. Louis, MO for replanting in controlled growth
chambers.
Symptom reproduction in the growth chamber
Selected cassava cuttings collected from the fields were
planted in a growth chamber at 25°C with a 16 hours day
length and 50% relative humidity and watered twice
weekly. CMD symptoms were recorded daily on the newly
formed leaves for the first three months and every three
days in the subsequent months for an eight month period.
Symptom severity on the top five fully-expanded leaves
was scored using a scale described by Fauquet et al [25].
DNA extraction
Total DNA was extracted from the symptomatic cassava
leaves collected in the field and growth chamber as
described by [26].
Polymerase chain reaction, cloning, and sequencing
Full-length copies of DNA-A were amplified from total
cassava plant DNA extracts using sets of primers (Table 1).
UNI/F and UNI/R are degenerate primers with annealing
positions in the AC1 gene designed to amplify near fulllength DNA-A of CMGs (2.7–2.8 kbp) leaving an unamplified portion of ~17 nts. From the near full-length CMG
sequences, primers were designed to amplify the remaining partial DNA-A sequences including the missing 17 nts
from the original samples. Partial fragments consisting of
a region between the BC1 gene and intergenic region (IR)
of DNA-B components of EACMV isolates from different
cassava-growing areas were amplified by universal primers EAB555-F and EAB555-R (Table 1) designed to
amplify PCR products of about 540–560 kbp depending
on the virus isolate. In order to amplify the DNA-A and
DNA-B full-length, PCR was performed with 94°C denaturation followed by 35 cycles of 1 min at 94°C, 59°C for
1 min and 2 min at 72°C. For amplification of the partial
DNA-B fragment (BC1/IR), PCR conditions were 30 cycles
of 94°C for 1 min, 55°C for 1 min, 72°C for 1 min and
an extension cycle of 10 min at 72°C. PCR products of the
expected sizes were electrophorezed in a 1% agarose gel in
TAE buffer (10 mM tris-acetate, 1mM NaEDTA, pH 8.0),
purified, and cloned into the pCR 2.1 vector using the TA
cloning kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Clones containing putative viral sequences were identified by miniprep
screening and confirmed positive for inserts by PCR
amplification using their respective PCR primers, and
inserts were subsequently sequenced in both directions.
The complete and partial nucleotide sequences of CMGs
were determined by the dideoxynucleotide chain
termination method using an ABI automatic sequencer on
both orientations at the Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry Laboratories (PNACL), Washington University
School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, USA (ABI377

http://www.virologyj.com/content/2/1/21

DNA sequencer, Perkin Elmer, Foster City, CA). Sequence
fragments of < 600 kbp were generated using M13 universal primers. Moreover, to obtain overlapping data from
opposite strands of large or full-length fragments, single
primers were constructed for genome walking. Sequences
were submitted to GenBank and the accession numbers
are as follows: Complete nucleotide sequence of DNA-A
named EACMCV-[TZ1] (AY795983); EACMCV-[TZ7],
(AY795984); EACMV-UG2 [TZ10], (AY795988); EACMV[KE/TZM] (AY795986); EACMV-[KE/TZT], (AY795985);
EACMV-[TZ/YV], (AY795987); ACMV-[TZ] (AY795982);
and DNA-B for EACMCV-[TZ1](AY795989). Partial DNAB (BC1/ICR) sequences of EACMV isolates from Tanzania
named TZB (AY800251), TZB1 (AY800252), TZB2
(AY800253), TZB3 (AY800254), TZB4 (AY800255), TZB5
(AY800256), TZB6 (AY800257), TZB7 (AY800258), TZB8
(AY800259), TZB9 (AY800260), TZB10 (AY800262),
TZB11 (AY800261), and TZB12 (AY800263).
Computer analysis of CMG sequences
Virus sequences were edited using BioEdit Sequence
Alignment Editor (Hall, 1999) and SeqEdit (DNAStar,
Madison, WI) to obtain a consensus sequence for each.
Reference geminiviruses for full length CP and CR
sequence alignments were compiled by extracting the
complete DNA-A and DNA-B sequences, the CP ORF
(approximately 765–777 bp) and CR sequences (approximately 150–170 bp) from sequences available in GenBank (accession # are provided in the figures). Multiple
sequence alignments of the full-length DNA-A, DNA-B,
capsid protein (CP) gene and common region (CR) were
carried out using the Clustal Program (MegAlign, DNAStar). The phylogenetic trees were constructed from the
multiple alignments by the neighbor-joining majority
rule consensus. Multiple alignments were analyzed by
maximum parsimony with full-length DNA-A, DNA-B
and CP phylogenetic trees using Phylogenetic Analysis
Using Parsimony (PAUP) [27] and a bootstrap analysis
with 1000 replicates was performed. Only values above
50% were reported on the trees in the figures. Virus specific iterons in the CR of selected CMGs were identified
and compared with the analogous iterons of the Tanzanian isolates of CMGs.
Recombination analysis for cassava mosaic geminiviruses
The pairwise comparison sequence analysis (PCSA)
method compares the profile of a pair of sequences to that
of an average profile of sequences that are selected a priori,
based on knowledge that the selected sequences are
related to the species or the isolate levels [20]. According
to the guidelines established by the ICTV Geminiviridae
Study-Group, two geminivirus sequences sharing more
than 89% identity of their A component sequences are
considered strains or isolates of the same species. Where
homology is less than this, they are considered to be

members of different species [5]. However, viruses that
share between 80 and 90% sequence identity are often
found to be recombinants [2], therefore, in the PCSA, we
consider viruses sharing less than 80% identity as
different species. PCSA profiles were carried out between
sequences of different species and of different isolates and
an average profile for the considered cluster of viruses was
calculated for these two categories with increments of 50
nts along the genome sequence. A standard deviation
value for each segment was calculated and minimum and
maximum values corresponding to two standard deviation values were also calculated (Fig. 1). Each chosen pairwise analysis for putative recombinant sequences was
then compared to the species average profile and the pertaining of each 50 nts fragment to this category is examined. Segments different from more than 2 standard
deviation values were considered to be putative recombined fragments. For each PCSA, a putative recombination percentage for the genome is calculated and a
corresponding map can be drawn. It is verified (a posteriori) that the particular representatives of species and isolates selected for the 'Species and Isolate Average Curves'

are 100% non-recombinant at the time of the analysis
[20]. No statistical test is applied to PCSA.
