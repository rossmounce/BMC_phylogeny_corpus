Abstract
Background: The domesticated silkworm, Bombyx mori, is the model insect for the order Lepidoptera, has
economically important values, and has gained some representative behavioral characteristics compared to its wild
ancestor. The genome of B. mori has been fully sequenced while function analysis of BmChi-h and BmSuc1 genes
revealed that horizontal gene transfer (HGT) maybe bestow a clear selective advantage to B. mori. However, the
role of HGT in the evolutionary history of B. mori is largely unexplored. In this study, we compare the whole
genome of B. mori with those of 382 prokaryotic and eukaryotic species to investigate the potential HGTs.
Results: Ten candidate HGT events were defined in B. mori by comprehensive sequence analysis using Maximum
Likelihood and Bayesian method combining with EST checking. Phylogenetic analysis of the candidate HGT genes
suggested that one HGT was plant-to- B. mori transfer while nine were bacteria-to- B. mori transfer. Furthermore,
functional analysis based on expression, coexpression and related literature searching revealed that several HGT
candidate genes have added important characters, such as resistance to pathogen, to B. mori.
Conclusions: Results from this study clearly demonstrated that HGTs play an important role in the evolution of B.
mori although the number of HGT events in B. mori is in general smaller than those of microbes and other insects.
In particular, interdomain HGTs in B. mori may give rise to functional, persistent, and possibly evolutionarily
significant new genes.
Keywords: Bombyx mori horizontal gene transfer, phylogeny, functional analysis

Background
The silkworm, Bombyx mori, was domesticated over
5,000 years ago and is well-known for its industrial
importance in sericulture [1]. B. mori has become a
model organism for studying other Lepidoptera insects
that cause serious agricultural damage and is also an
important model for scientific discovery in the areas of
microbiology, physiology, and genetics. However, compared to its wild ancestor, B. mori has gained some
representative behavioral characteristics such as tolerance to human proximity and handling, as well as extensive crowding and lost other traits such as flight,
predators, and diseases avoidance [2].

Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) has been not only
regarded as a driving force in the innovation and evolution of genomes in prokaryotes, but also plays an important role in eukaryotes [3,4]. In some specific eukaryotes
(such as rotifers), HGT also serves as a important evolutionary impetus [5,6]. However, in most cases, the transferred genes in insect genomes are absence of function
[7]. In contrast, Daimon et al. (2003, 2008) found that
HGT maybe bestow a clear selective advantage to B.
mori based on function analysis of BmChi-h and
BmSuc1 genes, which have been cloned from B. mori
[8,9] The first gene contributed the potential fungi resistance to B. mori while the latter gene serves as a sugardigesting enzyme which can degrade the alkaloidal sugar
mimic glycosidase inhibitors that are toxic to B. mori.
These results indicated that the HGTs in B. mori are
different from those of other insects, which may play
important function in the evolution of B. mori.
Some methods such as GC content and codon usage
have been applied in the detection of gene transfers, but

these methods have been demonstrated to be unreliable
without phylogenetic analysis [10,11]. Indeed, the detection of gene transfers is best achieved by generation of a
strongly supported phylogenetic tree which contradicts
the known species phylogeny [4,10]. Luckily, the genome
of B. mori has been recently fully sequenced [8]. This
provides a strong basis for the overall understanding of
the existence and functions of HGTs in B. mori based
on phylogenetic analysis.
In this study, the HGT events between B. mori and
other unrelated species were investigated by sequence
comparison of the entire predicted proteomes from B.
mori with the genome sequences of 87 eukaryotic and
295 prokaryotic (Additional file 1), which represent a
wide taxonomic diversity, and generated individual phylogenetic trees by different models combining with
other evidences for every gene that showed a higher
similarity to Arthropoda than those of other genomes.
This process identified 10 putative gene transfers. Analysis of expression and coexpression revealed that these
HGTs could enhance the disease resistance ability,
nutrient and energy metabolism and toxin degradation.
These studies give us a first glance to understand the
HGTs in the evolution of B. mori by whole genome
analysis.

Methods
Genome

The genome of Bombyx mori has a size of 428.7 Mb and
is composed of 28 chromosomes [12]. Gene candidates
for HGT in B. mori were identified by screening the
14,623 coding genes downloaded from SilkDB [13].
Local database generating

In order to construct the phylogenetic trees for each
sequence identified with the target taxon/similarity profile automatically and preciously, a local database (300
cores Processor BladeSystem in Zhejiang University,
IBM-Biocomputing Laboratory) containing predicted
protein sequences (2,385,947 coding sequences in total)
from 382 species representing a wide diversity of eukaryotes and prokaryote taxa including seven insects, seven
plants, 43 fungi, 30 other eukaryotes and 295 prokaryotes (Additional file 1).
Search procedure

Each candidate sequence in B. mori was compared
against sequences in the local database using BLASTp
[14] and the highest similarity sequences from each species were extracted for further analysis (E-value cutoff
10-20). We used the local database first to exclude insect
unique genes and the genes that, when compared
against all the genomes showed a higher BLASTp similarity score to Arthropoda than to any other species

Page 2 of 9

(Figure 1). All sequences that had a high sequence similarity to the transposon were also excluded from further
analysis as we aimed to study the effect of HGT on the
putative functional genes (Figure 1). After detecting the
putative transferred genes, expression sequence tags
(EST) information was used to remove out the unexpressed genes. The detailed procedure was showed in
Figure 1.
Phylogenetic analysis

The remaining candidate HGT genes were selected to
search against GenBank non-redundant protein database
(nr). Search strategy was the same as described above.
These sequences were aligned using ClustalW [15], the
conserved region of each alignment was trimmed using
Gblocks [16] with a stringent settings described previously [17]. Maximum Likelihood (ML) phylogenies
were constructed by Phyml [18] using a JTT + Γ + I
substitution model (Γ + I parameters were estimated by
Phyml). The proportion of invariant sites was estimated
from the data. For Bayesian phylogenies generated by
MrBayes [19], two independent Metropolis-coupled
Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) runs, each with
one cold and three heated chains (heat parameter =
default), were analyzed for one million generations after
a burn-in of 25,000 samples and allowed mixed models
of amino acid substitution. For Maximum Likelihood
phylogenies, 1,000 bootstraps were performed to gain
the branch support values. To be considered as an indicative of a potential HGT event, the ML branch support
about B. mori should ≥ 80% while Bayesian posterior
probability should ≥ 85%.
To test the support for contentious topology, we performed nonparametric branch support tests based on a
Shimodaira-Hasegawa-like procedure using Tree-Puzzle
[20]. In addition, we used this software to test the statistical significance (5%) of specific topology over a collapsed version of the same branching relationship.
Functional analysis

To test whether the transferred genes were associated
with the domestication of B. mori, single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) genelist [2] produced by resequencing 40 B. mori genomes was used to search if the candidate genes are on the list. Meanwhile, expression and
coexpression analysis about the transferred genes were
also conducted. A Pearson correlation coefficient was
calculated based on microarray gene expression profiling, which were downloaded from SilkDB [13] to investigate the function of transferred genes analyzed in this
paper. Background correction and data normalization
was done by RMA algorithm in Bioconductor [21] and
the poor annotated probe-sets were removed. Measurements for unique gene was calculated from means of

the probes belong to same gene. The gene coexpressed
with one of either gene in ten putative transferred genes
with the absolute correlation |r| > 0.5 was further
selected to analyze the function. For each transferred
gene, we obtained the top 300 genes in each list sorted
by absolute correlation value r referred to as coexpressed genes in descending order. The distribution of
coexpressed genes with each transferred gene was

mapped onto pathways. A score reflecting the extent of
coexpression in each gene was assigned to each pathway
by using following formula:

Spathway =

, where

G is the number of genes in a pathway present in the
top 300 of all same transferred genes. Ri is the rank of
the ith gene of the specified pathway in a list, ri is the
absolute correlation value r.

Results and Discussion
The process of HGT candidate search

Two horizontally transferred genes have been previously
described in B. mori [8,9]. In this paper, an exhaustive
analysis was used to investigate any other HGT candidates. This study used a pipeline with several filters to
search for B. mori predicted coding genes that are candidates obtained by HGT as summarized in Figure 1. In
the first filter, the 14,623 predicted coding genes of B.
mori were compared with 382 genome sequences, which
excluded 6,315 genes as possible HGT candidates since
they have homologs only in insect genomes. A total of
8,308 remaining proteins with their correspondent
homologs were clustered using OrthoMCL [22] to
group together potential orthologs (default parameters).
In the second filter, the insect sequences in these orthologs were removed except B. mori. Every predicted B.
mori protein sequence that showed a higher BLAST
similarity score to a gene from any other species rather
than Arthropoda was retained for subsequent analysis.
This filter screen resulted in 229 clusters which were
considered to be candidate B. mori HGTs. In the third
filter, the 229 candidate HGT genes in B. mori were
submitted to a BLASTp search against nr database, producing two categories of results. The first category consists of 122 few-hit genes, which were meaningless to
construct the phylogenetic trees (Fewer than 5 genes in
one phylogeny). The second category comprised the
remaining 107 predicted genes with enough homologs.
These genes were considered reliable HGT candidates.
In the forth filter, phylogenetic trees were generated to
test the possible HGTs. The criteria used in this procedure as indicative of HGT is the candidate gene should
group with sequences from a non-related species with
the gene on a well supported clade. The 107 HGT candidates produced 60 phylogenies that did not support
the criteria (Figure 1). The remained 47 candidate HGT
genes were validated by Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic methods (both methods inferred the
same topology). In all these data sets, the SH test also
showed the HGT topology at the 5% significance level
[23]. As in this study, only functional genes were of our
interest. So, in the last filter, B. mori EST database was
used to remove the unfunctional genes, whereas transposons and retrotransposons were also excluded from
further analysis. In order to reduce the errors, Chinese
and Japanese B. mori EST databases were both applied
[12,24]. The EST procedure reduced 33 genes while the
latter procedure reduced 4 genes. This resulted in 10
putative HGT data sets, which were selected for further
analysis. The general information about the 10 genes
was presented in Table 1 and the phylogenetic trees
about these genes were shown in Supplementary

Page 4 of 9

Figures. In additional, we also performed a blast against
the B. mori genome itself to verify if those candidates
could be duplicates. However, all of the 10 genes have
no homologes out of themselves.
In this study, stringent filters were used to identify the
real HGT events. Although this procedure could identify
the really HGT event undoubtedly, it may neglect several potential HGT events. First, the HGT in the common ancestor of Insecta may be considered as vertical
inheritance in this study if none of the other sampled
taxons has homolog. As no homologs were detected
outside insects, it might be assumed that this HGT was
from an extinct linkages [25]. However, this assumption
can only been proved by fossil evidence. Second, our filter could also remove genes transferred from other animal to B. mori as we only retained the genes showed a
higher BLAST similarity score to a gene from any other
species rather than Arthropoda (Material and Methods).
However, fewer instances of potential HGTs between
eukaryotes are known [4,26], and most of these HGTs
were plastids-eukaryote transfer. Finally, we only
retained the transferred genes that have putative functions as functional genes may play more important role
in physical and biochemical reaction in B. mori.
Comparative phylogenetic analysis, which included
models that account for site rate heterogeneity and,
where appropriate, comparative topology tests were
used in our study. We finally identified 10 genes that
was the most consistent explanation to have been transferred from the genome of bacteria to the genome of B.
mori. The number of transferred genes is nearly the
same as recently Acyrthosiphon pisum sequencing paper
[7]. The direction of transfer from prokaryote to B. mori
is also highly suggested in our analysis. As in the phylogenetic trees, B. mori nested within a bacterial clade,
and many bacterial species formed basel branches.
Meanwhile, all of these 10 genes are intronless in the B.
mori. Based on these results, the direction of transfer
from prokaryote to B. mori is mainly confirmed. Recent
findings suggested that substantial HGT between prokaryotic endosymbionts and their insect hosts were
always happened [7,27-32]. However, in this study, none
of the putative transferred gene was acquired from a
previous commonly reported endosymbiont (Wolbachia
or Buchnera).
The HGT events in B. mori are rare but recent

It has long been described that many insects such as pea
aphid, mosquitoes, and fruit flies have been influenced by
HGT from Wolbachia [33]. Nikoh et al. have suggested
that nearly 30% of a Wolbachia genome was found on the
X-chromosome of the insect, probably as the result of a
single HGT event [30]. In this study, we only get 10 HGTs

5% confidence level was used in SH test

in silkworm. Compared to previous reports, we may think
that the HGT events are rare compared to other insects.
The CDS of 10 putative transferred genes were used to
search against wildsilkbase [34], which is a BLAST searchable catalogue of ESTs generated from three major wild
silkworms, Antheraea assama, Samia cynthia ricini and
Antheraea mylitta. We found that the transferred genes in
B. mori were actually absent in three wild silkmoths. This
phenomenon can be explained by two hypotheses. The
first suggests that the aliened genome fragment was transferred to the B. mori chromosome after speciation of Bombycoidea, while the latter suggests an ancient HGT in the
common ancestor with several losses. However, the
“losses” hypothesis is highly unlikely for two reasons. It
requires massive independent losses to explain the presence of these genes only in B. mori. Furthermore, this
hypothesis has difficulty to explain the remarkable
sequence identity between B. mori and its candidate
donors (Table 1), while the general gene similarity
between wild and domesticated silkworm is 58.6% based
on the protein sequences of Antheraea assama deposited
in Genbank. Taking into account, it appears most likely
that the aliened genome fragment was transferred to the
B. mori chromosome after speciation of Bombycoidea. The
result suggested that these HGT events may be happened
much recently. The recovery of only 10 potential HGT in
B. mori suggests that HGT events happened in this species
have played only a very minor role in its evolution (0.065%
in the B. mori protein coding genes). Interestingly, none of
the HGT events involved donor linkages from the

common ancestor of Insecta. Instead, all of the HGTs
involved transfer from bacteria or plant directly to the
Bombycidae except chitinase, which has been demonstrated to be an ancient HGT event [9]. It is worth noting
that half of these transfers originate from the Enterobacteriaceae species. Many Enterobacteriaceae species have been
demonstrated to be as symbionts of insects [35]. It may
facilitate to exchange the genetic material between symbionts and hosts.
Putative functional assignment of 10 HGTs

The potential identities and biological functions of the
10 HGT candidates were investigated based on the similarity of their putatively encoded products to known
proteins. We found that the 10 putative transferred
genes were all enzymes, which suggested a strong functional trend among these HGTs in B. mori. Furthermore, hypergeometric distribution analysis of the
candidate HGT genes indicated catalytic activity and
hydrolase activity genes are significantly overrepresented
(with p-values 4.6e -05 and 6.4e-06, respectively). Compared with our study, none of the putative functional
gene was identified in Aphid genome sequence analysis
[7]. The acquisition of such genes by HGT may therefore have been selected by a competitive advantage in
the recipient to degrade or take up substrates with
greater efficiency.
One HGT data set (Figure 2) transferred from bacteria
to B. mori in this study is a enzyme encoding NADdependent epimerase/dehydratase (BGIBMGA010285,

Zhu et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:248

Page 6 of 9

pfam01370, e-value 3.2e-25), which catalyses the last step
in biosynthesis of GDP-d-rhamnose in bacteria [36].
This kind of gene has been demonstrated to be transferred in chromalveolates [37]. Expression analysis suggested that this gene was highly expressed in
integument and fat body (Figure 3), whereas coexpression analysis revealed that this gene may be associated
with biotin metabolism with high value support (Additional file 2). As insect store energy reserves mainly in
fat body cells [38] and biotin metabolism is related to
silk synthesis by nutrient affection [39]. Based on these
results, we can infer that this gene may be associated
with nutrient and energy metabolism in B. mori.
A putative glycerophosphoryl diester phosphodiesterase (BGIBMGA007767, pfam03009, e-value 1e -52 ) was
encoded by an HGT candidate from the Pseudomonas
species to B. mori (Additional file 3). This enzyme display
broad specificity for glycerophosphodiesters, glycerophosphocholine, glycerophosphoethanolamine, glycerophosphoglycerol and bis (glycerophosphoglycerol), all of
which are hydrolysed by this enzyme. This gene also has
been reported to be involved in HGT between spider and
bacteria [40]. Expression analysis suggested that this gene
was not only highly expressed in integument and fat
body but also in midgut and hemocyte. Coexpression
analysis indicated that the function of this gene may be
consistent with BGIBMGA010285.
Two genes, encoded chitinase and sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase, are the only two genes which have

been reported to be transferred from bacteria to B. mori
previously [8,9] were also identified in this study. B.
mori acquired the first gene from a bacterium or an
ancestral baculovirus and the latter gene from a bacterium [8,9]. The results suggested that both genes bestow
a clear selective advantage to B. mori. The discovery of
both genes indicated that our strategy in searching candidate HGTs in B. mori is reliable.
Another candidate HGT was a gene transferred from
Edwardsiella tarda (Additional file 4). Homology analysis suggested that this gene was a glucose-1-phosphatase/inositol
phosphatase
(BGIBMGA011204,
pfam00328, e-value 1.4e -17 ). This enzyme has been
reported to enhance the phytase activity in bacteria [41].
Expression pattern revealed that this gene is extremely
highly expressed in head (Figure 2). Coexpression analysis suggested that the function of this gene may be most
associated with Butirosin and neomycin biosynthesis
(Additional file 2). As the gene in this pathway is
involved in aminoglycoside antibiotics biosynthesis,
which is effective against several types of bacteria [42].
The result indicated that this gene may be associated
with the resistance of B. mori to bacterial pathogen.
The sixth HGT candidate (Additional file 5) showed
sequence similarity to alginate lyase (BGIBMGA005615,
pfam08240, e-value 2.1e -08 ), which can catalyze the
degradation of alginate by a b-elimination mechanism
[43]. In bacteria, this enzyme has been reported to
destroy the cell detachment, which is the key process in
biofilm formation [44]. Unfortunately, there is no corresponding probe to detect this gene in microarray data.
The seventh, eighth and ninth HGT are putative
kynureninase (BGIBMGA007146, pfam00266, e-value
2.6e -18 ),
N-methyltryptophan
oxidase
(BGIBMGA008215, pfam01266, e-value 4.2e -54 ) and
gamma- glutamyltranspeptidase (pfam01019, e-value
4.3e-125), respectively. The seventh gene encoded by an
HGT candidate from Listeria grayi to B. mori (Additional file 6). The mutation of this gene has been
reported to be associated with abnormal body coloration
in B. mori [45]. The eighth and ninth genes were both
encoded by an HGT candidate from Enterobacteriaceae
to B. mori (Additional file 7 and 8). In both genes, the
eighth one has been reported to be involved in substrate
specificity determination [46] while the ninth gene plays
a key role in the gamma-glutamyl cycle, a pathway for
the synthesis and degradation of glutathione and drug
and xenobiotic detoxification [47]. All of the three genes
are highly expressed in malpighian tubule (Figure 2),
and the coexpression patterns are similar (Additional
file 2). The results indicated that these genes may be
associated with valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation pathway (Additional file 2). It has been reported
that after B. mori was infected by its bacterial pathogen

Page 7 of 9

Bacillus bombyseptieus, the expression level of the genes
which are associated with valine, leucine and isoleucine
degradation pathway were more than three times the
baseline levels in the malpighian tubule. Huang et al.
(2009) speculated that these genes might be involved in
the detoxification of malpighian tubules [48]. The results
suggested that these genes may be associated with the
resistance of B. mori to bacterial pathogen.
The tenth gene which encoded as aromatic ring-opening dioxygenase LigB subunit (BGIBMGA003842,
pfam02900, e-value 1.2e-51) was transferred from a plant
donor (Additional file 9). No tissue specific expression
pattern was observed in this gene (Figure 2). However,
coexpression analysis suggested that this gene may be
most associated with Butirosin and neomycin biosynthesis (Additional file 2). It has been reported that Butirosin and neomycin belong to a family of clinically
valuable 2-deoxystreptamine (2DOS)-containing aminoglycoside antibiotics [49]. The result indicated that this
gene may be associated with the resistance of B. mori to
bacterial pathogen.
In this study, the coexpressed genes involved in HGT
are mapped onto biological pathway to investigate the
potential function in B. mori. This scheme provides a
comprehensive way to identify previously unknown
functional patterns in sets of genes with known functions. It has been well known that the domesticated B.
mori has gained or lost some representative behavioral
characteristics compared to its wild ancestor. A lot of
researches have focused on the search for ‘domestication
genes’ in mammals by the polygenic nature of most
behavioral traits [50]. Indeed, the linking of coat-color
genes in mammals to brain biochemistry and behaviors
has been found to be able to facilitate domestication
and ease of handling [50]. In our study, SNP data
searching indicated that all of the 10 genes have no
direct relationship with human domestication although
all of these genes are suggested to be transferred
recently after the divergence from the wild silkworm.
Therefore, we could suggest that HGT in B. mori maybe
mainly depend on its nature requirement, but not on
human activity. However, our study strongly suggested
that these transferred genes increase the ability of B.
mori to natural survival and adaption.

Conclusion
In this study, we conclude that HGT is both rare and
recent between B. mori and other unrelated species
based on large-scale genome sequence data analysis
using a strict and highly conservative set of ML and
Bayesian methods combining with other analysis such as
EST checking for inferring HGTs. Results from this
study clearly indicated that HGT in B. mori has
occurred and may have provided advantageous gene
