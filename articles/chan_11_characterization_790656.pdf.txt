Abstract
Background: Cell-to-cell communication (quorum sensing (QS)) co-ordinates bacterial behaviour at a population
level. Consequently the behaviour of a natural multi-species community is likely to depend at least in part on coexisting QS and quorum quenching (QQ) activities. Here we sought to discover novel N-acylhomoserine lactone
(AHL)-dependent QS and QQ strains by investigating a bacterial community associated with the rhizosphere of
ginger (Zingiber officinale) growing in the Malaysian rainforest.
Results: By using a basal growth medium containing N-(3-oxohexanoyl)homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C6-HSL) as the
sole source of carbon and nitrogen, the ginger rhizosphere associated bacteria were enriched for strains with AHLdegrading capabilities. Three isolates belonging to the genera Acinetobacter (GG2), Burkholderia (GG4) and Klebsiella
(Se14) were identified and selected for further study. Strains GG2 and Se14 exhibited the broadest spectrum of
AHL-degrading activities via lactonolysis while GG4 reduced 3-oxo-AHLs to the corresponding 3-hydroxy
compounds. In GG2 and GG4, QQ was found to co-exist with AHL-dependent QS and GG2 was shown to
inactivate both self-generated and exogenously supplied AHLs. GG2, GG4 and Se14 were each able to attenuate
virulence factor production in both human and plant pathogens.
Conclusions: Collectively our data show that ginger rhizosphere bacteria which make and degrade a wide range
of AHLs are likely to play a collective role in determining the QS-dependent phenotype of a polymicrobial
community.

Background
Bacteria employ sophisticated cell-to-cell communication networks which instigate population-wide behavioural changes in response to environment stimuli.
Such population-dependent adaptive behaviour results
in altered gene expression in response to the production
and sensing of chemical information in the form of diffusible signal molecules, commonly referred to as

autoinducers. The process, whereby an increase in the
concentration of signal molecule(s) in the extracellular
milieu reflects cell population density is called ‘quorum
sensing’ (QS). At a threshold concentration of the QS
signal molecule (when the population is considered to
be ‘quorate’), the target genes are induced or repressed.
In different bacterial genera, these may include genes
which code for the production of secondary metabolites,
plasmid transfer, motility, virulence, and biofilm development (for reviews see [1,2]).
In many Gram-negative bacteria, QS depends on the
actions of N-acylhomoserine lactone (AHL) signal

molecules [1,2]. These consist of a homoserine lactone
ring linked via a saturated or unsaturated acyl chain
(generally between 4 and 18 carbons) and without or
with a keto or hydroxy substituent at the C3-position
(for reviews see [1,2]). AHL biosynthesis primarily
depends on the actions of enzymes belonging to the
LuxI or LuxM protein families while the response to an
AHL is usually driven by the interaction between the
signal molecule and a member of the LuxR protein
family of response regulators [1,2].
Since QS controls a range of biological functions associated with virulence and as the emergence of multiantibiotic resistant bacterial strains is in the ascendency,
there is increasing pressure to discover novel therapeutic
approaches to combat bacterial infections [3,4]. Interrupting QS may represent one such method which has
the added advantage that the targets are not normally
essential for bacterial survival and therefore are not subject to the same selective pressures observed for conventional growth inhibitory antimicrobials [3-6].
Quorum quenching (QQ) refers to the process in
which QS is disrupted. QQ can be achieved in several
ways such as through the enzymatic destruction of QS
signal molecules, the development of antibodies to QS
signal molecules or via agents which block QS. In this
context both the QS signal synthase and sensor or
response regulator proteins are the primary targets [3-6].
Under alkaline conditions AHLs are rapidly inactivated by pH-dependent lactonolysis in which the homoserine lactone ring is hydrolysed to the ring open form
(i.e. the corresponding N-acylhomoserine compound) in
a reaction which can be reversed by acidification [7,8].
This reaction can also be driven enzymatically by lactonases such as AiiA, AttM, AiiB [9,10] and AhlD [11].
There is also a second class of AHL-degrading enzymes
which are amidases/acylases such as AiiD [12] and
PvdQ [13] which cleave the AHL amide bond releasing
homoserine lactone and the corresponding fatty acid.
The ability to inactivate AHLs enzymatically is shared
by diverse bacteria belonging to the a-Proteobacteria
including Agrobacterium, Sphingomonas, Sphingopyxis
and Bosea, the b-Proteobacteria such as Variovorax, Ralstonia and Comamonas, the g-Proteobacteria including
Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter, Firmicutes such as
Bacillus and Actinobacteria such as Rhodococcus as well
as the Streptomyces sp. (reviewed by Uroz et al [6]).
Since QS often controls virulence in both plant and animal pathogens [1,2], QQ bacteria have potential as biocontrol agents which protect plants from pathogens while
novel AHL-inactivating enzymes may have utility as therapeutic agents [6]. Consequently, we have been exploring
novel rhizosphere environments for bacterial communities
displaying both AHL-dependent QS and AHL-degrading
activities. Since both beneficial rhizosphere bacteria and

Page 2 of 13

pathogens may use the same or very similar AHLs, it is
important that QQ directed toward the latter do not perturb the former [6]. Hence the identification of strains
expressing highly specific QQ enzymes would have significant utility. Here we focus on the AHL-inactivating activities of a community of bacteria associated with the roots
of Zingiber officinale (ginger) growing in the Malaysian
rainforest. Three AHL-inactivating bacteria belonging to
the genera Acinetobacter, Burkholderia and Klebsiella
were identified and isolated using an enrichment assay
employing N-(3-oxohexanoyl)homoserine lactone (3-oxoC6-HSL) as the sole nitrogen and carbon source. While
the Acinetobacter and Klebsiella strains both exhibited
broad spectrum lactonase activity, the Burkholderia strain
reduced 3-oxo-AHLs to the corresponding 3-hydroxy
compounds. The Acinetobacter and Burkholderia strains
both possessed AHL-producing and AHL-inactivating
activities and in co-culture experiments we show that all
three ginger rhizosphere isolates are capable of reducing
the production of key P. aeruginosa QS-dependent virulence determinants and Erwinia carotovora-mediated tissue damage in a potato tuber infection model.

Results
Selection of QQ bacteria from ginger rhizosphere

To enrich for rhizosphere-associated bacteria with AHLdegrading capabilities, a ginger rhizosphere suspension
was used to inoculate a basal medium containing 3-oxoC6-HSL as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen [14].
Bacterial growth was evident within 48 h but only in the
samples containing 3-oxo-C6-HSL (data not shown).
The enrichment culture was plated onto solidified basal
KG medium [14] containing 3-oxo-C6-HSL which was
passaged for single colonies which were subcultured on
LB agar. Seven ginger rhizosphere-associated bacteria
with four distinctive morphotypes (GG1, GG2, GG3,
GG4, GG5, GGp and Se14) were chosen for further
study.
The ginger rhizosphere strains were identified by 16S
rDNA sequencing and analysis of the aligned sequences
(1498 nucleotides) was performed by web-based similarity searches against the GenBank database. The strains
were identified as Acinetobacter spp. (GG2 and GG3),
Burkholderia spp. (GG1 and GG4), Klebsiella sp. (GG5
and Se14) and Microbacterium sp. (GGp). Since the 16S
rDNA sequence data indicated that GG1, GG3 and GG5
are very closely related to GG4, GG2 and Se14 respectively, we chose to focus on GG2, GG4 and Se14. GGp
was also omitted from further investigation. The GG2
16S rDNA sequence showed 99% identity with Acinetobacter spp. and clustered phylogenetically with Acinetobacter calcoaceticus [GenBank Accession Number
EF432578] and a poorly characterized Acinetobacter sp.
[GenBank Accession Number DQ366106]). The GG4

Chan et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:51
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/51

16S rDNA shared 99% sequence identity with Burkholderia cepacia PRE5 [GenBank Accession Number
AY946011) while Se14 is most closely related to Klebsiella species PN2 [GenBank Accession Number
AY946011]. The accession numbers for the 16S rDNA
sequences of Acinetobacter sp. (GG2) [GenBank:
GQ245971], Burkholderia sp. (GG4) [GenBank:
HQ728437] and Klebsiella sp. (Se14) [GenBank:
HQ728438] have been deposited with GenBank.
The 3-oxo-C6-HSL-inactivating activity of each strain
was assessed, and Figure 1 shows the lack of any residual 3-oxo-C6-HSL after incubation with GG2 or with

Se14 for 24 h. However, 3-oxo-C6-HSL was still
detected after incubation with GG4 cells for 24 h
(Figure 1).
Characterization of QQ Activities of Acinetobacter GG2,
Burkholderia GG4 and Klebsiella Se14

To determine the range of AHLs inactivated by each of
the three ginger rhizosphere isolates, whole cells resuspended in PBS buffer were incubated for up to 96 h
with a range of AHLs differing in acyl chain length (C4C14), the presence or absence of a C3 substituent (oxo
or hydroxy) or with a series of 3-hydroxy-C14-HSLs
with a double bond at either C9, C10, C11 or C13
(Table 1). After incubation, any remaining AHLs were
detected using the appropriate AHL biosensor as
described in the Methods section and compared with
Escherichia coli DH5a and PBS as negative controls.
The data obtained are summarized in Table 1. Using
biosensor assays Klebsiella Se14 inactivated all of the
AHLs tested while Acinetobacter GG2 showed broad
activity but was most effective against the long chain

GG4 exhibited no apparent activity against the AHLs
using these biosensor assays (data not shown).
Since natural AHLs are in the L-configuration, we
sought to determine whether the AHL inactivating
activities observed were stereospecific. After incubation
of GG2 and Se14 whole cells with the D-isomer of

was extracted and analysed by HPLC rather than using
the AHL biosensors which do not respond to D-isomers.
For GG2 and Se14 the peak corresponding to 3-oxo-C6D-HSL was reduced after 3 h incubation and effectively
absent after 24 h. The data for Acinetobacter strain GG2
are shown in Figure 2A. Similar results were obtained
for Se14 (data not shown) indicating that AHL

incubated with GG4.

inactivation by these two ginger rhizosphere bacteria is
not stereospecific. Although the biosensor assays did not
demonstrate any AHL inactivation for Burkholderia
GG4, HPLC analysis revealed that the peak corresponding to 3-oxo-C6-D-HSL was reduced with the concomitant appearance of a new peak (Figure 2B) suggesting
that GG4 was capable of modifying AHLs.
Identification of the AHL degradation products

To determine whether Acinetobacter strain GG2 inactivated AHLs through cleavage of the acyl chain or via
lactonolysis or both, 3-oxo-C6-HSL was first incubated
with GG2 cells for 24 h. The cells were removed and
the supernatant was collected, acidified to pH 2 and
incubated for a further 24 h. This results in the pHmediated re-cyclization of any ring opened compound
present [8] which was subsequently detected using the
C. violaceum CV026 AHL biosensor [15]. Figure 1
shows that while no 3-oxo-C6-HSL was detected in the
supernatant after 24 h incubation with GG2, it could be
recovered by acidification indicating that GG2 possesses
lactonase activity. To investigate whether GG2 also exhibits amidase activity a cell-free GG2 24 h culture supernatant grown in the presence of 3-oxo-C6-HSL was
treated with dansyl chloride which reacts with the
exposed free amine of the homoserine lactone ring following release of the AHL acyl chain [16]. No dansylated homoserine lactone was detected indicating that
GG2 does not exhibit acylase activity (data not shown).
Similar acidification experiments to those described
above for Acinetobacter GG2 were carried out for Klebsiella Se14. These showed that Se14 also possesses a lactonase. Since Klebsiella pneumoniae has previously been
reported [11] to possess a homologue of the Arthrobacter lactonase gene ahlD termed ahlK, we used primers
based on ahlK to determine whether the gene was also
present in Se14. A single PCR product was obtained and
sequenced and found to be identical to the ahlK gene
(data not shown). When Se14 ahlK was expressed in E.
coli DH5a, AHL biosensor assays revealed that there
was a reduction in bioluminescence consistent with a
decrease in 3-oxo-C6-HSL when compared to the vector
control. Upon acidification of the supernatant AHL biosensor activity could be restored thus confirming that
AhlK has lactonase activity (data not shown).
When Burkholderia strain GG4 was incubated with
3-oxo-C6-D-HSL for 3 h and examined by HPLC, we
noted the appearance of a new peak (retention time
4.3 min) that was absent when either GG2 or Se14 was
incubated with the same D-isomer (retention time
4.8 min) (Figure 2B). Similar results were obtained following incubation of the natural L-isomer of 3-oxo-C6HSL with GG4 and the new peak was found to co-migrate with the L-isomer of 3-hydroxy-C6-HSL (data not

Page 5 of 13

shown) suggesting that GG4 has oxido-reductase activity
towards 3-oxo-AHLs. To confirm the oxido-reductase
activity of GG4, 3-oxo-C6-L-HSL incubated with GG4
for 0 h and 24 h was analysed by mass spectrometry
and the appearance of 3-hydroxy-C6-HSL was confirmed by detection of the precursor ion (m/z 216.2 ([M
+H])) and fragment ions of m/z 198.0 ([M+H-H 2 O])
and 102.0 (Figure 2C) which are characteristic of 3hydroxy-AHLs which readily lose a water molecule and
the homoserine lactone moiety respectively [17,18].
Similar results were obtained on incubation of GG4
with the L-isomers of 3-oxo-C4-HSL or 3-oxo-C8-HSL
in that new HPLC peaks co-eluting with 3-hydroxy-C4HSL and 3-hydroxy-C8-HSL synthetic standards, respectively, were observed after incubation for 6 h (data not
shown). This oxido-reductase activity was only apparent
when 3-oxo-AHLs were incubated with GG4 whole cells
but not cell lysates (data not shown).
Acinetobacter GG2 and Burkholderia GG4 produce AHLs

Since some but not all Acinetobacter and Burkholderia
strains have previously been reported to produce AHLs,
we wondered whether QQ and QS activities co-exist in
GG2, GG4 and Se14. To determine whether any of the
three ginger rhizosphere strains produced AHLs, they
were first cross-streaked against each of three different
AHL biosensors namely C. violaceum CV026, E. coli
[pSB401] and E. coli [pSB1075], and the plates examined
over time for the induction of violacein or bioluminescence (data not shown). GG2 induced bioluminescence
in E. coli [pSB1075] indicating that it was producing long
chain AHLs, GG4 activated both CV026 and E. coli
[pSB401] indicative of short chain AHL production while
Se14 failed to activate any of the three AHL biosensors.
To identify unequivocally the AHLs produced by GG2,
spent culture supernatant extracts were analysed by
liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to hybrid quadruple-linear ion trap mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS),
which revealed the presence of 3-oxo-C12-HSL and
3-hydroxy-C12-HSL by comparison of their retention
times, precursor and principal fragment ions with synthetic standards. Figure 3 shows the fragmentation patterns for 3-oxo-C12-HSL (precursor ion m/z 298.2 [M
+H]; fragment ions m/z 197.2, 102.0 (Figure 3A and
Figure 3C) and 3-hydroxy-C12-HSL (precursor ion m/z
282.2 [M-H 2 O]; fragment ions m/z 181.2, 102.1)
(Figure 3B and Figure 3D). The mass spectra of the
extracted AHLs were similar to the corresponding synthetic compounds. Quantitative analysis by LC-MS/MS
of the AHLs produced by GG2 over a 24 h period
revealed that 3-hydroxy-C12-HSL was the most abundant AHL produced by GG2 which attains a maximum
level after 12 h growth, but is almost undetectable after
24 h (data not shown).

from the corresponding synthetic compounds (Additional File 1).
QQ biocontrol activity of the ginger rhizosphere isolates

To determine whether any of the three ginger rhizosphere bacterial isolates were capable of quenching virulence factor production in human (P. aeruginosa) and
plant (Er. carotovora) pathogens which utilize different
AHLs, we undertook co-culture experiments. Figure 4A

shows that Acinetobacter GG2 and Burkholderia GG4
both reduced elastase production approximately twofold when compared to the P. aeruginosa PAO1 control
whereas the Klebsiella strain Se14 was the most effective, reducing elastase levels about 16-fold. None of the
QQ bacteria inhibited the growth of P. aeruginosa
which reached a similar viable count in co-culture as
was attained in monoculture (data not shown). GG2 and

Se14 both effectively reduced the expression of lecA in
P. aeruginosa although GG4 had comparatively little
effect (Figure 4B).
The QQ potential of GG2, GG4 and Se14 for attenuating the 3-oxo-C6-HSL-dependent pectinolytic activity
of Er. carotovora was assessed in planta using a potato
tuber infection model after viable count experiments
confirmed that none of the strains affected the growth

when injected into the potato tuber but when co-cultured with any of the three ginger rhizosphere isolates,
maceration of the potato tissue by the phytopathogen
was greatly reduced (Figure 5).

In the present work, four bacterial morphotypes from
the same ginger rhizosphere bacterial community were

isolated and identified as a consequence of their ability
to grow on an enrichment medium [14] containing 3oxo-C6-HSL as the sole carbon and nitrogen source.
BLAST search analyses of the 16S rDNA sequences
identified the strains as belonging to the genera Acinetobacter, Burkholderia, Klebsiella and Microbacterium. In
semi-quantitative whole cell assays, we evaluated the
AHL-inactivating spectrum of the three Gram-negative
isolates. The broadest range of activity was noted for
Klebsiella strain Se14 which inactivated each of the 24
structurally diverse AHLs evaluated including the D-isomer of 3-oxo-C6-HSL. Similarly Acinetobacter strain
GG2 exhibited a broad spectrum of activity but was less
effective against short chain AHLs. In contrast, Burkholderia GG4 was inactive against the unsubstituted AHLs
but was active against the 3-oxo-AHLs. Although AHLdegrading activity has not previously been characterized
in the genus Burkholderia, a soil isolate from this genus
capable of growing on AHLs as the sole nitrogen but
not carbon source was reported by Yang et al [19]. This
differs from Burkholderia strain GG4 which did not
grow on 3-oxo-C6-HSL as a source of both carbon and
nitrogen and probably came through the enrichment
process as a consequence of AHL turnover by the other
bacteria in the ginger rhizosphere community. Nevertheless, when GG4 was incubated with 3-oxo-C6-HSL in
PBS buffer, GG4 reduced this AHL to the corresponding
3-hydroxy compound. Similar results were obtained for
3-oxo-C4-HSL and 3-oxo-C8-HSL as well as the D-isomer of 3-oxo-C6-HSL indicating that the activity was
not AHL chain length dependent or stereospecific. This
simple reduction of a 3-oxo-AHL to the corresponding
3-hydroxy compound is likely to impact on QQ. For
example, in Er. carotovora where carbapenem antibiotic
biosynthesis and exoenzyme production are regulated by
3-oxo-C6-HSL, the corresponding 3-hydroxy compound
has only 1% of the activity of the 3-oxo-AHL [20]. For
P. aeruginosa, the 3-hydroxy-C12-HSL was approximately 8-fold less active than the 3-oxo compound [21].
These data suggest that simple modification of the 3oxo moiety is likely to substantially reduce the activity
of 3-oxo-AHLs and to contribute to the QQ activity
within a bacterial community. A similar oxido-reductase
activity has been observed for a strain of Rhodococcus
erythropolis isolated from the tobacco rhizosphere [22].
In contrast to Burkholderia strain GG4, this Gram positive bacterium (R. erythropolis) was unable to reduce 3oxo-C6-HSL and required an AHL acyl chain of at least
eight carbons [22]. However in common with GG4, the
activity was only observed on incubation of 3-oxo-AHLs
with whole, live bacterial cells as cell lysates were inactive [22].
For Klebsiella and Acinetobacter, AHL-inactivating
activity has previously been noted by Park et al [11] and

Chan et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:51
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/51

Kang et al [23], respectively. For the former, an AHLdegrading enzyme (AhlK) related to AhlD from Arthrobacter has been cloned and sequenced and by homology
suggested to be a lactonase [11]. Here we have shown
that the same gene is conserved in the Klebsiella ginger
rhizosphere isolate Se14 and have demonstrated that the
recombinant enzyme expressed in E. coli is indeed a lactonase with very broad AHL-inactivating activity including both short and long chain AHLs (with saturated or
unsaturated acyl side chains of 4 to 14 carbons). These
include N-(3-hydroxy-7-cis-tetradecanoyl)homoserine
lactone (3-hydroxy-C14:1-HSL), an AHL which was originally termed the Rhizobium small bacteriocin [24]
because it inhibits the growth of Rhizobium leguminosarum strains which carry a ‘sensitivity locus’ on Sym
plasmids such as pRLJ1 [24]. 3-hydroxy-C 14:1 -HSL is
also produced by soil bacteria such as Pseudomonas
fluorescens [17].
Acinetobacter GG2 also degraded a wide range of short
and long chain AHLs via a lactonase activity although
we were unable to identify the gene involved. Although
the mechanism of AHL degradation has not previously
been determined in this genus, an Acinetobacter strain
isolated from cucumber rhizosphere has been reported
to degrade both C6-HSL and N-octadecanoyl homoserine lactone (C18-HSL) as well as the AHLs produced by
a biocontrol strain of Pseudomonas chlororaphis and a
phytopathogenic strain of Burkholderia glumae [23].
Interestingly, Acinetobacter GG2 not only degrades
AHLs but also produces AHLs which we identified as
3-hydroxy-C12-HSL (major) and C12-HSL (minor).
Previously Niu et al [25] showed that the human nosocomial pathogen, Acinetobacter baumannii, produces
3-hydroxy-C12-HSL and C12-HSL via the LuxI
synthase, AbaI, the expression of which is AHL dependent. In A. baumannii, AHL-dependent QS appears to
contribute to biofilm development since abaI mutants
were less biofilm proficient than the parent strain [25].
Acinetobacter strains isolated from contact lenses have
been reported not to produce any AHLs [26] whereas a
study of 43 Acinetobacter strains isolated from both hospital patients and the environment and assayed using
AHL biosensors showed that most of the strains examined produced AHLs although these were not chemically characterized [27]. Furthermore a comparative
genome analysis of three different Acinetobacter strains
from three different environments revealed the presence
of a luxIR-type locus in a multidrug resistant clinical A.
baumannii isolate which was disrupted by an insertion
element in a sensitive strain isolated from human body
lice but completely absent from a soil isolate [28].
In Acinetobacter GG2, 3-hydroxy-C12-HSL accumulated in the growth medium reaching a maximal level
after 12 h before rapidly being degraded. This indicates

Page 9 of 13

GG2 tightly controls its own AHL production and turnover and suggests that sustained expression (or repression) of the QS target genes is not required in stationary
phase. The coupling of AHL synthesis and degradation
in the same bacterium has previously been noted for
Agrobacterium tumefaciens which produces and
degrades 3-oxo-C8-HSL during early stationary phase
via a lactonase encoded by attM which is activated by
starvation signals and the stress alarmone (p)ppGpp
[29,30]. Similarly, a marine Shewanella strain which produces AHLs in late exponential phase degraded its long
chain AHLs in stationary phase via both lactonase and
acylase/amidase activities [31]. In polymicrobial biofilms,
this Shewanella isolate interfered with AHL production
in other bacteria and as a consequence, their ability to
enhance the settlement of algal zoospores was compromised [31]. Here, we also found that the ginger rhizosphere Burkholderia isolate GG4 is not only capable of
interfering with QS by reducing 3-oxo-AHLs to the corresponding 3-hydroxy compounds but also produces
AHLs including 3-oxo-C6-HSL, C9-HSL and 3-hydroxyC8-HSL. While most Burkholderia strains synthesize
C6-HSL and C8-HSL [32,33], 3-hydroxy-C8-HSL production has only been confirmed in the pathogen, Burkholderia mallei [32] and tentatively identified in the
environmental non-pathogenic Burkholderia xenovorans
[33]. In B. mallei, C8-HSL and 3-hydroxy-C8-HSL are
produced by two different AHL synthases (BmaI1 and
BmaI3) [32]. In Burkholderia GG4, it remains to be
established whether 3-hydroxy-C8-HSL is produced
directly via a LuxI-type synthase or is a consequence of
the reduction of 3-oxo-C8-HSL.
Bacteria such as GG2, GG4 and Se14 which produce
and/or modify/degrade QS signals are likely to have a
major impact on the properties of polymicrobial bacterial communities. Here we have shown that the ginger
rhizosphere isolates were each capable of reducing virulence factor production in both P. aeruginosa and Er.
carotovora. However, GG4 was unable to down-regulate
lecA (which codes for the cytotoxic galactophilic lectin
A [34]) expression probably as a consequence of its
inability to reduce C4-HSL [35] in contrast to elastase
which is predominantly LasR/3-oxo-C12-HSL dependent
[36].

Conclusions
Three different QQ bacteria associated with the ginger
rhizosphere have been isolated and characterized as
belonging to the genera Acinetobacter (GG2), Burkholderia (GG4) and Klebsiella (Se14). GG2 and Se14 exhibited the broadest spectrum of AHL degrading activity
via lactonolysis while GG4 reduced 3-oxo-AHLs to the
corresponding 3-hydroxy compounds. In GG2 and GG4,
AHL-dependent QQ co-exists with AHL-dependent QS

Chan et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:51
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/51

suggesting that these bacteria are likely to play a major
role in determining the QS-dependent phenotype of the
polymicrobial community from which they were isolated. This was confirmed by co-culture experiments in
which all three rhizosphere bacteria attenuated virulence
factor production in both a human and a plant pathogen
without inhibiting growth of either pathogen.

Methods
Bacterial strains, growth media and culture conditions

The bacterial strains used in this study are listed in Table 2.
Bacteria were routinely grown in Luria Bertani (LB) medium buffered when required with 50 mM 3-[N-morpholino] propanesulfonic acid (MOPS) to pH 6.8 to prevent
alkaline hydrolysis of AHLs [8]. For the enrichment of QQ
bacteria from the ginger rhizosphere, KG medium supplemented with 3-oxo-C6-HSL (500 μg/ml) was used [14]. C.
violaceum CV026, Er. carotovora strains and the rhizosphere isolates were grown at 28°C, E. coli and P. aeruginosa strains at 37°C. When required, the E. coli growth
medium was supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml)
and tetracycline (5 μg/ml). C. violaceum CV026 required
kanamycin (30 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (30 μg/ml).
Enrichment procedures for bacteria degrading AHL from
ginger rhizosphere

Ginger roots were collected at the Rimba Ilmu, University of Malaya (Malaysia). Soil was removed by rinsing

Page 10 of 13

thoroughly with sterile distilled water after which 1 g of
rhizosphere tissue was added to 10 ml of KG medium,
vortexed vigorously for 10 min, sonicated for 1 min and
finally vortexed for 1 min. After which, 2 ml of this suspension was briefly centrifuged to remove root debris,
re-centrifuged at 13,000 × g (5 min) after which the pellet was washed and resuspended in 2 ml of KG medium
to give the final rhizosphere suspension. Then, 100 μl of
this suspension was inoculated into 3 ml of KG medium
containing 3-oxo-C6-HSL (500 μg/ml) and the cells
were grown at 28°C with shaking at 220 rpm. After 48
h, a 5% (v/v) transfer was made to fresh, sterile KG
medium and subsequent transfers made at 48 h intervals. After six enrichments the appropriately diluted cell
cultures were plated onto LB agar and KG medium supplemented with 3-oxo-C6-HSL (50 μM) solidified with
1.5% (w/v) Bacto-Agar to isolate individual colonies.
DNA manipulation

Genomic DNA and plasmid extraction, manipulation
and competent cells were prepared using standard
methods [37]. Treatment of PCR mixtures without DNA
template was performed as previously described [38].
PCR mix (Promega, UK) was used to amplify 16S rDNA
with the universal primers 27F and 1525R (Table 3).
PCR conditions, cloning and sequencing of the PCR
products were carried out as previously described [14].
DNA sequences were analysed with the Lasergene

amplified from Klebsiella Se14 by PCR using the primers KF and KR (Table 3). A single band of 0.85 kb
was amplified and ligated to pGEM-T Easy and introduced into E. coli DH5a. A positive clone exhibiting
QQ activity was sequenced.
Synthesis of AHLs and related compounds

AHLs including the D-isomer of 3-oxo-C6-HSL were
synthesized, purified and characterized as previously
described [20,39].

(Kromasil C8; 250 × 4.6 mm) attached to a photodiode
array (PDA) system (Waters 996 PDA system operating
with a Millennium 2010 Chromatography Manager,
Waters, England) and eluted with acetonitrile/water isocratic or gradient combinations as described before [17].
Identification of AHLs

AHLs were unequivocally identified by LC-MS/MS as
described before [17,42] using enhanced product trap
experiments (EPI) triggered by precursor ion scanning
between the m/z range 150-500 and in particular for the
fragment ion m/z 102 which is characteristic for the
homoserine lactone ring moiety. The EPI spectra (m/z
range 80-400) containing a fragment ion at m/z 102
were compared for the retention time and spectral properties to a series of corresponding synthetic AHL standards. The 3-hydroxy-AHLs were identified by
comparison with a synthetic standard based on the LC
retention times, the MS-MS fragmentation product ions
([M+H-H2O] and m/z 102). 3-hydroxy-AHLs characteristically lose a water molecule during MS fragmentation
generating a characteristic ion of [M-18] [17,43].
P. aeruginosa QQ co-culture assays

AHL-inactivation assays

GG2, GG4 and Se14 were grown overnight at 28°C with
shaking (220 rpm) in LB medium to approximately 109
cfu/ml, cells (100 ml) were collected by centrifugation,
washed and resuspended in 100 ml of PBS (100 mM,
pH 6.5). AHLs were evaporated to dryness in a suitable
tube and rehydrated with cell suspension providing a
final AHL concentration of 1 μM (for biosensor activation assays) or 50 μM (for HPLC analysis). The reaction
mixture was incubated for up to 24 h at 28°C with gentle shaking. To stop the reaction, an equal volume of
ethyl acetate was added, after which the AHLs were
extracted with ethyl acetate. Any residual AHLs were
detected using the lux-based biosensors E. coli [pSB401]
or E. coli [pSB1075] for long and short chain AHLs,
respectively, [40] using a microtitre plate bioassay based
on that described by Reimmann et al [41]. Bioluminescence in the microtitre plate wells was visualized using
Luminograph LB980 photon video camera (Berthold).
To determine whether AHLs were being inactivated
by lactonolysis, i.e. by the formation of the corresponding N-acylhomoserine compound, the method described
by Yates et al [8] was used. This is based on acidification of the reaction mixture to pH 2 with HCl (10 mM)
to promote recyclization of the homoserine lactone ring.
HPLC analysis of AHLs and AHL-degradation products

HPLC analysis of AHLs and their degradation products
was performed as described before [17,20] on an analytical C 8 reverse-phase preparative HPLC column

The ability of ginger rhizosphere isolates to attenuate P.
aeruginosa QS-regulated virulence determinants (elastase and lectin A) were determined by growing cultures
of P. aeruginosa PAO1, GG2, GG4 and Se14 separately
at 28°C for 24 h with shaking (220 rpm), normalizing at
an OD600 of 1.0 followed by co-culturing at a 1:1 ratio.
Total viable cell counts were carried out to ensure that
neither organism significantly reduced the growth of the
other.
The elastolytic activity of P. aeruginosa was determined as described before using elastin-Congo red
(ECR) as substrate. Briefly, 100 μl of cell free bacterial
spent culture supernatants from both mono-culture and
co-culture experiments were added separately to 900 μl
ECR buffer (100 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 1 mM CaCl 2 )
containing 20 mg of ECR and incubated with shaking at
37°C for 3 h. Insoluble ECR was removed by centrifugation at 7,000 × g for 5 min. The absorbance of the
supernatant was determined at OD495. The expression
of lecA was determined using a P. aeruginosa lecA::lux
reporter strain [35] in a 96-well microtitre plate using
an automated combined luminometer/spectrometer
(Anthos Labtech LUCYI). Briefly, 200 μl of a 1:500 dilution of an overnight culture of the P. aeruginosa lecA::
lux reporter and either GG2, GG4 or Se14 (100 μl from
each culture in co-culture experiments, or 200 μl in
monoculture experiments) were loaded into the plate
wells and luminescence and OD 495 were determined
every 30 min for 24 h. Each co-culture experiment was
carried out in triplicate and repeated at least twice.

Quenching of the pectinolytic activity of Er. carotovora

Inhibition of the pectinolytic activity of Er. carotovora
was carried out with modification as described before
[44,45] using potato tubers. Tubers were washed, sterilized with 70% v/v ethanol, then extensively rinsed with
sterile water and finally dried under sterile conditions.
Bacterial cells were grown overnight at 28°C in LB,
washed, resuspended and diluted in sterile saline to
OD 600 of 1.0. Bacterial suspensions (Er. carotovora
GS101 or the Er. carotovora AHL-synthase mutant
PNP22 [44]) (negative controls), monocultures or cocultured with GG2, GG4 or Se14 were introduced
directly into the tubers using a 200-μl tip fitted on a
micropipette. Tubers were incubated at 25°C, 90%
humidity for 3 days. The results of the inoculation were
assessed by visual inspection after slicing the tubers.

Additional material
Additional file 1: Mass spectra AHLs produced by GG4. Extracts from
spent culture supernatants of GG4 were analysed by mass spectrometry.
The peak ion at m/z 102 is characteristic of the homoserine lactone ring (A,
B, E and F). By comparison with the corresponding synthetic standards (C,
D, G and H) the precursor ion at m/z 214.2 and fragment ion at m/z 113.0
suggest the presence of 3-oxo-C6-HSL (A); the precursor ion at m/z 228.2
and fragment ion m/z 109.1 are indicative of C8-HSL (B); the precursor ion
at m/z 226.2 [M-H2O] and fragment ion m/z 125.1 are indicative of 3hydroxy-C8-HSL (E); the precursor ion at m/z 242.2 and fragment ion of m/z
142.2 are indicative of C9-HSL (F). AU: Absorbance unit.
