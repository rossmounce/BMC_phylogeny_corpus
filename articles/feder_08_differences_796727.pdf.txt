Abstract
Background: Recent genome-wide association studies searching for candidate susceptibility loci
for common complex diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its common
complications have uncovered novel disease-associated genes. Nevertheless these large-scale
population screens often overlook the tremendous variation in the mitochondrial genome
(mtDNA) and its involvement in complex disorders.
Results: We have analyzed the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genetic variability in Ashkenazi
(Ash), Sephardic (Seph) and North African (NAF) Jewish populations (total n = 1179). Our analysis
showed significant differences (p < 0.001) in the distribution of mtDNA genetic backgrounds
(haplogroups) among the studied populations. To test whether these differences alter the pattern
of disease susceptibility, we have screened our three Jewish populations for an association of
mtDNA genetic haplogroups with T2DM complications. Our results identified population-specific
susceptibility factors of which the best example is the Ashkenazi Jewish specific haplogroup N1b1,
having an apparent protective effect against T2DM complications in Ash (p = 0.006), being absent
in the NAF population and under-represented in the Seph population. We have generated and
analyzed whole mtDNA sequences from the disease associated haplogroups revealing mutations in
highly conserved positions that are good candidates to explain the phenotypic effect of these
genetic backgrounds.
Conclusion: Our findings support the possibility that recent bottleneck events leading to overrepresentation of minor mtDNA alleles in specific genetic isolates, could result in populationspecific susceptibility loci to complex disorders.

Background
The quest for susceptibility genes of common complex
disorders such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has led
to recent successful discoveries of novel disease-related
genes through the use of large scale genome-wide association studies including thousands of patients belonging to
major ethnic groups [1]. Disease-associated loci often fail
to replicate in different populations, because of patterns
of population-specific susceptibility [2]. This may occur
due to genetic drift and founder effects, turning minor
alleles in a certain populations to prevalent ones in
another population. One may hypothesize that some of
these alleles carry functional effects underlying differences
in disease susceptibility between populations. Revealing
such an effect requires mining special populations, such
as the Jews, that due to bottleneck events have increased
incidence of alleles that are less abundant in the general
population.
The Jewish people underwent several recent bottleneck
events after the 2600 year old Babylonian and 2000 year
old Roman deportation from Israel [3,4]. These resulted
in geographically separated Jewish communities that kept
their customs and religion over centuries, mostly marrying within the communities with little or no intermarriage
with local non-Jews, suggesting several founder events.
Thus, Jews represent an excellent model to study possible
association of population-specific alleles with common
disorders, including T2DM [5].
T2DM is the most common metabolic disease today, with
increasing incidence in the Western world (1). Growing
evidence for dysfunction of the mitochondrial energy production machinery (OXPHOS) in many T2DM patients
[6] highlights the role of altered OXPHOS activity in the
molecular basis leading to the common forms of T2DM:
(a) approximately 1% of diabetic patients have large
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions or the A3243G
point mutation [7,8]; (b) expression of OXPHOS-related
genes is decreased in muscle tissues of diabetic individuals
[9,10]; (c) mitochondrial ATP production is decreased
and intra-myocellular fat content is increased in offspring
of T2DM patients [11]; (d) in pancreatic beta-cells of
mice, cellular depletion of mtDNA and knock-out of
mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) interfere
with insulin secretion [12,13].
Given that T2DM is a common complex disorder with
considerable heritability, it is probably influenced by a
combination of predisposing common genetic variants,
potentially including mtDNA variants. Although mtDNA
genetic variants have previously been associated with
complex disorders in some populations [14], its extensive
genetic variability [15] and uniparental inheritance may
result in diverse association among specific populations

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/198

[16]. Indeed, mtDNA genetic association with T2DM
exemplifies the differences among populations: significant association of certain mtDNA genetic backgrounds
(haplogroups) was found in Asians [17] but not in Caucasians as documented in a recent large scale analysis [18].
Additionally, association of mtDNA variants with T2DM
was limited to specific populations [19-21]. The only
example of a mtDNA variant (T16189C) associated with
T2DM in both Caucasian and Chinese populations
[22,23] was recently questioned [24].
Similar to T2DM, diabetic complications are complex
phenotypes determined by multiple pathways with a large
genetic component. Diabetic complications increase
markedly in incidence after 5–10 years of active T2DM,
but with extreme variability in onset and progression, i.e.
some individuals developing severe complications relatively early in the disease course, while others fail to
develop any significant complications despite many years
of severe disease. Being responsible for most T2DM-associated mortality, diabetic complications involve pathology in small and large vessels (micro- and macrovascular
disease), encompassing malfunction of the mitochondrial
OXPHOS [25]. Thus, mtDNA variants could be logical
candidates to alter the genetic risk to the major diabetic
complications- nephropathy, retinopathy and cardiovascular disease [26].
To search for possible population-specific association
between mtDNA common genetic variants and the common complications of T2DM we examined mtDNA
genetic variability in three Jewish populations: Ashkenazi,
Sephardic and North African Jews.

Results
A total of 1,179 T2DM patients comprised of three populations (762 Ashkenazi Jews [Ash], 191 non-Ashkenazi
European Jews [Seph], and 226 North African Jews
[NAF]), were genotyped and assigned to different mtDNA
haplogroups. Almost 90% of the subjects belonged to one
of the 12 most prevalent mtDNA haplogroups in
Ashkenazi Jews, i.e., K1, K2, U (non-K), H, V, J1, J2, T,
N1b, I, X, W (Figure 1). R × C test of independence [27]
indicated that haplogroup distribution varied significantly among the three Jewish patients populations (G =
180.1, df = 30, p < 0.001), implying that each of these
patients populations should be analyzed separately. Specifically, there was an over-representation of haplogroup
T in Seph patients, HV* in NAF patients, haplogroups K1,
K2 and N1b in the Ashkenazi patients. Although the
observed differences are among populations of patients
and do not necessarily apply to the general population,
our data is in line with previous reports of differences in
mtDNA haplotypes distribution among Jewish populations, thus supporting the hypothesis that separate

founder events led to the establishment these different
Jewish populations (Figure 1) [3,28]. Furthermore,
sequencing of the mtDNA hyper variable region 1 (HVR1)
of haplogroup N1b patients in our populations revealed
that the Ashkenazi population harbored only the 1614516176A-16223 motif termed "N1b1" which is extremely
rare in other populations, whereas of the seven Seph N1b
patients, five harbored the N1b1 motif and two harbored
a 16145-16176G-16223 motif termed "N1b2" which is
found at low prevalence in Caucasians. Haplogroup N1b
was totally absent from the NAF population, thus further
supporting separate bottleneck events in the Ash, Seph
and NAF populations.
This significant genetic divergence of mtDNA genetic variation could result in population-specific signals of
mtDNA association with complex disorders. In order to
evaluate this we have assessed possible association of
mtDNA haplogroups with the major complications of
T2DM separately within each of the three populations.
This approach enabled minimizing the possible effects of
population stratification. First, each population was
divided into patients that had developed cardiovascular
disease, retinopathy or nephropathy (Tables 1, 2, 3) and a

group of patients who did not develop any of these complications after at least 10 years of known diabetes ("nocomplications" group). These complications were chosen
because of their high prevalence in T2DM and since the
organs involved (heart, retina and kidney, respectively)
are highly affected in mitochondrial disorders [29].
In an attempt to identify candidate haplogroups for association with T2DM complications a permutation analysis
was performed (see Additional file 1 and Additional file 1
– Table 1). In the Ash population haplogroup J1 was
detected as a plausible candidate for association with
retinopathy and nephropathy (p = 0.035 and p = 0.022,
respectively) and haplogroup N1b1 for association with
nephropathy (p = 0.003) (Table 1). In the Seph population haplogroup aggregate HV* and haplogroup T were
detected as borderline candidates for association with
retinopathy (p = 0.054) and nephropathy (p = 0.059),
respectively (Table 2). In the NAF population haplogroup
aggregate HV* was detected as a candidate for association
with nephropathy and cardiovascular disease (p = 0.024
and p = 0.014, respectively) (Table 3).

1HV* – samples belonging to the HV lineage, excluding haplogroup H but including haplogroup V. 2Others – include haplogroups JT* and L in
addition to unclassified, probably non-European haplogroups. **After removing the two J2 patients (see Materials and Methods), we were left only
with J1 patients; thus, the sample size of the "no-complications" group was reduced from 269 to 267, and that of the total population from 762 to
760.

These results suggest that the differences in haplogroup
distribution may result in different disease-associated
mtDNA factors in each population. To rigorously investigate the involvement of mtDNA haplogroups in the tendency to develop T2DM complications we focused only
on the significant candidate haplogroups (J1 and N1b in
the Ash population, and HV* in the NAF population).
mtDNA Haplogroups J1 and N1b associate with T2DM
Complications in Ashkenazi Jews
Using a logistic regression model and appropriate Bonferonni correction we compared the candidate haplogroups
with each of the other haplogroups while controlling for
the possible effects of patient characteristics (disease duration, sex and age). A possible association of a population
specific mtDNA haplogroup with T2DM complications
could be best tested in our Ashkenazi population (Ash),
since N1b1 is an apparently Ashkenazi-specific haplo-

group. Our analyses revealed that haplogroup N1b was
significantly under-represented in the nephropathy group
and in the cardiovascular group as compared with the nocomplication group relative to all other haplogroups (p =
0.006, odds ratio (OR) = 0.34 (0.15–0.74), and p = 0.017,
OR = 0.39 (0.18–0.84), respectively; also see Additional
file 1 – Table 2). In the retinopathy group however, no significant association with N1b was found. These results
imply that Ashkenazi T2DM patients pertaining to haplogroup N1b exhibit reduced susceptibility to the tested
T2DM complications.
In contrast to haplogroup N1b, haplogroup J1 was overrepresented in the Ash population only in the microvascular complications (retinopathy and nephropathy). A significant and specific effect of haplogroup J1 could be
masked by including patients who exhibit more than one
complication in each of the tested groups. This premise is

supported by the view that the risks of developing each of
the different complications are not entirely independent.
Retinopathy and nephropathy may have some common
pathophysiological features, and nephropathy per se may
increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Hence reciprocal interactions among the complications could mask the
effect of certain genetic backgrounds. To test for the possibility that patients pertaining to mitochondrial haplogroup J1 exhibit preferentially altered susceptibility to
either microvascular or macrovascular complications, we
performed the analysis on groups of T2DM patients having nephropathy or retinopathy but no evidence of cardiovascular disease and on T2DM patients with
cardiovascular disease who did not develop either nephropathy or retinopathy (for detailed information of haplogroup J1 compared to each of the other haplogroups,
see Additional file 1 – Table 3). This demonstrated a significant over-representation of haplogroup J1 in the "isolated" nephropathy group [p = 0.018, OR = 2.3 (1.15–
4.7)] and in the "isolated" retinopathy group [p = 0.017,
OR = 3.1 (1.2–7.8)]. However, no such trends could be
detected in the "isolated" cardiovascular group. These
results suggest that mutations defining mtDNA haplogroup J1 increase the propensity of Ashkenazi T2DM
patients to develop nephropathy or retinopathy but not
cardiovascular complications.
mtDNA Haplogroups Associate with T2DM Complications
in Non-Ashkenazi Jews
In accordance with our permutation test, logistic regression analysis revealed that NAF patients pertaining to the
HV* haplogroup aggregate had a threefold risk of developing nephropathy [p = 0.027, OR = 3.12 (1.14–8.6)] and
a fourfold risk of developing cardiovascular disease [p =
0.014, OR = 4.13 (1.33–12.9)] (see Additional file 1 –
Table 4). Notably our permutation test showed the same
tendency towards over-representation of haplogroup HV*
in Seph patients with nephropathy (Table 4) with borderline significance (see Additional file 1 – Table 1).

Taken together these observations suggest that different
mtDNA haplogroups may play a role in the propensity of
Jewish T2DM patients to develop complications in the
studied populations and that this propensity may be population specific.
Evaluating the Functional Significance of Mutations
Defining Haplogroups N1b and J1
Extensive study has shown several mutations affecting
nucleotide positions with a high degree of evolutionary
conservation in haplogroup J1, possibly underlying their
phenotypic consequences (see Discussion) [30,31]. Far
less attention has been devoted to haplogroup N1b,
although a recent study did indicate a difference between
N1b sequences of Ashkenazi Jewish origin and N1b
sequences in other groups [4]. To decipher the mutations
underlying the phenotypic consequences of haplogroup
N1b in the Ash population, we analyzed 20 whole N1b
mtDNA sequences, 12 of which from Ashkenazi Jews,
seven from other Middle-Eastern populations and one
from a population of European origin. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic neighbor joining tree reconstruction, including a haplogroup I sequence as an out-group,
revealed that sequences of Ashkenazi Jewish origin form a
branch distinct from those of other Middle-Eastern populations (Figure 2). A close investigation of the sequences
revealed nine coding region mutations in the stem of haplogroup N1b and additional eight mutations in the
Ashkenazi N1b tree node (designated N1b1), whereas
only three mutations lead to the non-Jewish tree node
(designated N1b2). The N1b1 node harbors five amino
acid changes in addition to the three amino-acid changes
in the stem of the haplogroup. None of the changes in the
N1b2 node alters an amino acid (Figure 2).

To test for the potential of the N1b-haplogroup-defining
changes to alter function, we studied their degree of evolutionary conservation by investigating the alignment of
mtDNA gene sequences from 42 different vertebrates and

invertebrates (see Methods and Additional file 1 – Tables
5 and 6). The degree of conservation was ranked high only
if it fell within one standard deviation range from the
mean conservation degree of mtDNA disease-causing
mutations [31] (Figure 2, Additional file 1 – Table 5).
Strikingly, only the N1b1 node (Ashkenazi Jewish) holds
highly conserved changes in addition to three highly conserved changes in the N1b stem thus supporting their
potential involvement in the protective effect of haplogroup N1b1.

Discussion
MtDNA genes, in contrast to nuclear DNA (nDNA)encoded genes, are in full linkage disequilibrium. The
mutation rate of the mtDNA is ~10 times faster than that
of the nDNA and thus it is the most variable coding region
in the human genome. Since mtDNA is maternally inherited, it is prone to genetic drift, resulting in large differences in patterns of genetic variability among and within
populations [32]. Such genetic drift often leads to difficulties in replicating results of mtDNA association studies
among populations. Hence, we hypothesized that, due to
its high genetic divergence among populations, a subset of
mtDNA alleles with functional consequences will differentiate among distinct populations. Here we have shown
that recent bottleneck events within the three studied Jew-

ish populations (Ash, Seph and NAF), underlie marked
differences in mtDNA diversity in three ethnically-related
Jewish populations, resulting in increased frequency of
genotypes in some populations, some of which may act as
susceptibility factors to T2DM complications. Such was
the case in the haplogroup N1b1 that was significantly
under-represented in certain complications of the
Ashkenazi population and not present in the NAF population.
In contrast to haplogroup N1b1, the haplogroups identified as factors with risk trends to some T2DM complications (haplogroup J1 and haplogroup aggregate HV*,
with marginal significant values considering a Bonferonni
corrected α<0.017) were present in all three studied populations. Nevertheless haplogroup J1, showing association with increased risk for T2DM nephropathy or
retinopathy in the Ashkenazi population does not have
enough power to replicate in the Seph and NAF populations, i.e. ~250 subjects in each of the complications
groups to replicate the significant results of the Ash population (power of 80%, α<0.05 (two tailed)) (Figure 1).
The significant over-representation of haplogroup aggregate HV* in certain complications of the NAF population
is harder to interpret, since although there was enough
power to detect its effect in the Ashkenazi population, i.e.

Neighbor joining phylogenetic reconstruction of whole mtDNA sequences of the N1b haplogroup. Haplogroup I
sequence was used as an out-group, since it is the phylogeneticaly closest haplogroup to N1b. Sequences were aligned and
bootstrapped 1000 times, and the tree was built with MEGA3 software. Sequence names ending with either "Ash" or "Pal"
were generated by us indicating non-diabetic Ashkenazi Jews and Israeli Arabs, respectively; otherwise a Genbank Identification
number (GI) was mentioned. It is worth noting that gi|82792542 and gi|82792304 N1b1 sequences originate from Ashkenazi
Jews whereas the N1b2 sequence gi|17985627 is of non Jewish Jordanian origin. Sequence designated Herrnstadt2002-336 was
downloaded from [45], as it was not available from Genbank. Numbers near the branches are the bootstrap values; numbers in

~70 subjects in each of the complication groups in order
to detect significance with a power of 80% and α<0.05
(two tailed), it did not show the same tendency as in the
NAF population. Nevertheless one should take into
account that HV* is a haplogroup aggregate; hence the different bottleneck events leading to the establishment of
the Ashkenazi and North African Jewish populations
could result in different compositions of lineages comprising the HV* haplogroup aggregate in the two populations. Testing for this possibility needs further genotyping
of HV*, requiring increased sample sizes of the studied
populations.
Our findings support association of mtDNA common
genetic variants with sub-phenotypes of T2DM. Interestingly, the inconsistency of mtDNA genetic association
with complications of T2DM as found here was described
for other phenotypes as well: While haplogroup J has been
associated with successful longevity in northern Italians
and the Finnish [33], it was not associated with successful
longevity in southern Italians [34] and subhaplogroup J1,
but not J2, was associated with successful longevity in the
Northern Irish [35]. Therefore, both differences in
mtDNA sub-groups and their differences in response to
environment appear to affect the relationship between
mtDNA genotypes and phenotypes. Since all of the functional SNPs in particular mtDNA lineages would have a
collective effect on mitochondrial function, many mtDNA
haplogroups and sub-haplogroups might interact with
environmental variation differently. Furthermore, this difference can be further complicated by the interaction of
mtDNA encoded subunits, harboring functional SNPs,
with nuclear DNA encoded subunits, harboring their own
genetic variation. This interpretation applies to our observation that N1b1 reduces the risk to T2DM complications
only in Ashkenazi Jews. In addition, the tendency to
develop complications is an interplay of environment and
genetics, hence it is not solely dependent on a particular
haplogroup, and thus the absence of the N1b1 haplogroup in the NAF cohort is not expected to change significantly the overall risk do develop complications.
Since our study observed disease-association with a population specific haplogroup, the Ashkenazi specific N1b1, it
was of importance to assess the functional potential of
this haplogroup defining mutations. During our sequence
analysis of haplogroup N1b we noticed that the Ash-specific sub-haplogroup N1b1 harbors an amino acid substitution in mtDNA position 4917 (Figure 2), which also
defines haplogroup T that was previously associated with
reduced sperm motility [31]. Interestingly, our permutation test suggests with borderline significance that haplogroup T might be in association (p = 0.059) with some
T2DM complications in the Seph population. Previously
[30,36] we showed that this mutation alters a highly con-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/198

served amino acid in the ND2 gene, hence suggesting a
functional potential. Since haplogroups N1b1 and T stem
from very different branches in the human mtDNA phylogeny it can be concluded that the 4917 mutation was
established at least twice during human evolution. All
these evidence imply that the change at position 4917
contributes to the protective effect against certain T2DM
complications.
Along with haplogroup J1 association with other multifactorial phenotypes [30,37], and its effect on the penetrance of mutations causing the eye disorder LHON [38]
our results support the premise that mutations defining
this haplogroup affect OXPHOS. Similar to haplogroup
N1b1, some mutations defining haplogroup J1 alter
amino-acids with high conservation degree: (1) a transition in position 10398 which is a Thr114Ala replacement
in the ND3 subunit of complex I, shown to alter mitochondrial matrix pH in cell-culture experiments [31]; and
(2) a transition in position 13708, causing a Ala458Thr
replacement in the ND5 complex I subunit. In addition,
haplogroup J1 harbors the G3010A substitution located
within the 12SrRNA gene. Although this mutation has
been found in several haplogroups [39], it is possible that
the combination of this mutation with the mutations that
generally define haplogroup J underlies the phenotypic
effect of J1 in the Ash population.
Interestingly, the non-synonymous changes in haplogroups J1 and N1b1 altered highly conserved amino-acid
positions in OXPHOS complex I, implying that they possibly affect the activity of this complex [40]. Accordingly,
anti-diabetic agents (metformin and thiazolidinediones)
act specifically through the inhibition of complex I activity [41], which suggests a role for complex I functional
alteration in the etiology of T2DM.

Conclusion
In summary, our results revealed notable differences in
mtDNA genetic diversity within Jews. Our association
study of mtDNA genetic variants with T2DM complications showed, that the differences in haplogroup distribution in the three studied populations were associated with
differences in disease susceptibility factors. These findings
supported our working hypothesis that minor alleles overlooked in large scale association studies may reveal their
functional potential in genetic isolates.

Methods
Patient population
The Israeli Diabetes Research Group (IDRG) collected
Jewish unrelated T2DM patients of Ashkenazi (Ash) origin (n = 762), of European non-Ashkenazi (Seph) origin
(n = 191) and North African Jews (NAF) from seven medical centers in Israel. The Ashkenazi Jews belong to a rela-

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:198

tively young population that has gone through a recent
bottleneck and thus has less genetic heterogeneity than
the general Caucasian population [41]. The Seph and NAF
Jewish populations are as young as the Ashkenazi population, yet may have gone through different bottleneck
events thus the three populations were analyzed separately. The countries of origin of the patients included in
this study can be viewed in Additional file 1-methods. To
avoid population stratification effects on the genetic variability, samples in the compared groups were matched for
the maternal country of origin.
The basic clinical characteristics of the patients are shown
in Table 4. Patients with at least 10 years of known diabetes were selected to assure a sufficiently high prevalence of
diabetic complications to provide adequate statistical
power in populations of this size. Using information from
the patients' medical records and from structured interviews; we initially classified the patients into two groups,
those who did not develop any complications after at least
10 years of clinical disease, and those who developed at
least one complication. The latter group was further
divided into three groups according to the complication
diagnosed: retinopathy – patients with proliferating diabetic retinopathy, macular edema and/or blindness; cardiovascular disease – patients with a history of percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty, coronary artery bypass
graft, myocardial infarction, and congestive heart failure;
and nephropathy – patients with microalbuminuria (>30
but < 300 mg protein per gram of creatinine) or proteinuria (>300 mg protein per gram of creatinine), with or
without decreased renal function.
DNA was extracted from peripheral lymphocytes by
standard techniques (Puregene, Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Written informed consent was obtained
from all individuals who participated in this study, which
was approved by the Hadassah Medical Organization's
Institutional Review Board for Human Studies.
Classification of haplogroups
Genotyping was conducted by a hierarchical approach,
starting from the most prevalent haplogroups in this population [42]. For detailed information see Additional file
1 – methods and Additional file 1 – Tables 7,8.
Statistical analysis
To avoid small sample sizes, some of the haplogroups
were grouped following phylogenetic considerations (for
details, see Additional file 1- methods). Statistical analyses were performed using Systat 11.0 (Systat Software,
Inc., CA, USA). We first used R × C (rows × columns) test
of independence to compare haplogroup distribution
among the three different Jewish populations. Next we
used a permutation test to detect candidate haplogroups

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/198

with altered representation in the complication groups in
each of the three Jewish populations. Permutation tests
were performed using a MATLAB (v.6.5) script: Complications (a binary indicator variable, 0 – no complication
and 1 – complication present) were randomly assigned
without replacement to patients with different mtDNA
genetic backgrounds (i.e., haplogroups). The proportion
of patients in each haplogroup who developed a specific
complication was calculated. Next the absolute difference
(two-tailed test) between each of these values and general
tendency to develop such a complication in the entire
population (i.e., the proportion of patients in the population who developed such a complication irrespective of
their genetic background) was recorded. This procedure
was repeated 10,000 times. P values were estimated as the
proportion cases in which the absolute difference
obtained during the simulations was equal to or greater
than that of the original data set. Finally, to test whether
the susceptibility to develop T2DM complications (represented by a binary indicator variable taking on values 0
and 1) differed among haplogroups, logistic regression
was performed to adjust for patient characteristics, i.e.,
disease duration, sex and age. It is notable that by converting the categorical variable "haplogroup" into a dummy
variable, we could compare the candidate haplogroups
with each of the other haplogroups using a single test, i.e.,
to avoid multiple testing. Specifically, since this variable
composed of 8–10 classes (depending on the population
analyzed), its inclusion in a logistic regression model
requires generating 7–9 indicator variables, respectively.
The coefficients of these indicator variables indicate
whether the propensity to develop complications in each
of the respective haplogroups differs from that of the reference (candidate) haplogroup (haplogroup J1 or N1b in
the Ash and the HV* lineage in the NAF populations). For
simplicity, we have presented in the text results from analyses in which we treated all the haplogroups in the aggregate excluding the reference haplogroup. The complete
analyses, in which these candidate haplogroups were
compared with each of the other haplogroups, are presented in Additional file 1 – Tables 2-4. To obtain an estimate for the relative risk of carriers of a particular
haplogroup to develop T2DM complications, odds ratios
(ORs) were calculated. Power analysis was conducted to
get an estimate of the sample size required to replicate our
results (see discussion). Although it was argued in the past
that corrections are not necessary in our case [43], we have
considered the three different complications examined as
potential multiple testing and the statistical significance
was Bonferonni corrected to α<0.017.

Estimating degrees of conservation of variants in the
mtDNA
Alignment of each of the mtDNA encoded proteins and
rRNA genes in 40 vertebrates (including man) and two
invertebrates (Drosophila and octopus) was performed
(see Additional file 1 – Table 5,6). This alignment was
used to assess the degree of conservation (CD), i.e., the
number of species that shared the same exact amino acid
or nucleotide positions in protein-coding or rRNA-coding
mtDNA genes, respectively (see Additional file 1 – Table
6). The CD of the naturally occurring variants in the whole
mtDNA sequences was compared with the mean CD of 20
mtDNA disease-causing mutations (36 ± 9) as previously
described. A position was considered highly conserved if
its CD was within one standard deviation from the mean
CD of the disease-causing mutations.
