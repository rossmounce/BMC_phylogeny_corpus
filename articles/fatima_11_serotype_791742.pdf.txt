Abstract
Background: Since the first reported outbreak of dengue hemorrhagic fever in Pakistan, several mini outbreaks
have erupted in the region. Dengue virus serotype 3 (DEN-3) was first documented in 2005 outbreak in Karachi.
Reports show that serotype 3 is prevalent in Lahore since 2008. Serotype 2 (DEN-2) is the major circulating
serotype in Pakistan as it is documented since 1994. We have conducted a detailed study of three outbreaks of
dengue virus infection that occurred in years 2007, 2008 and 2009 in Lahore by using molecular techniques such
as PCR and nucleotide sequencing of the C-prM gene junction of Dengue virus.
Results: Through the analysis of 114 serum samples collected over the period of three years (2007-2009), total 20
patients were found to be infected with dengue virus. In year 2007, four were positive for serotype 2 and one
sample was positive for serotype DEN-3. In 2008, five samples had concurrent infection with serotypes DEN-2 and
DEN-3 while three samples were infected only with serotype DEN-2. In year 2009, one sample had concurrent
infection with serotypes DEN-2 and DEN-3 while six were positive for serotype DEN-2 only.
Conclusions: Our study showed that serotype DEN-2 was dominant in positive samples of dengue virus infection
collected during the period of three years (2007-2009). The other serotype present was serotype DEN-3. Genotypes
of serotype DEN-2 and serotype DEN-3 were subtype IV and subtype III, respectively.

Background
Dengue infection is an important mosquito-borne viral
infection in areas where mosquitoes breed under optimal
conditions. As a member of the family Falviviridae, the
dengue virus is transmitted to human via Aedes genus,
especially Aedes agypti. This family also includes Hepatitis
C Virus, West Nile Virus and Yellow Fever Virus. Dengue
virus has four serotypes DEN 1-4. Sequencing of dengue
viral RNA has further verified strain variation within a
serotype allowing viruses to be classified into genetically
distinct groups within serotypes called genotypes. This

virus is prevalent in areas of Asia, Africa, Central and
South America [1,2]. Dengue viral infection can either
cause dengue fever (DF), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)
or dengue shock syndrome (DSS). The classical dengue
fever is mild, febrile illness which usually results after primary infection with dengue virus. In other cases DF can
lead to DHF or DSS which can be life threatening [3,4].
Infection with a different serotype can show severe outcome due to antibody dependent enhancement [2,5] and
can be a risk factor for DHF and DSS [2,6-8]. Though dual
infection with dengue virus is attributed to cause onset of
severe disease [9-11] but a case of mild disease due to dual
infection was documented in Brazil in 2003 [9]. Outcome
of disease may also depend upon the genotype involved.
Some genotypes induce greater viremia and are

transmitted more readily, thereby having a higher potential
to cause large epidemic [12,13].
Timely and correct diagnosis is very critical for patient
management as no definitive vaccine has been developed
against all dengue virus serotypes. Methods are being
employed for diagnosing the dengue virus infection like
viral isolation techniques, serological methods and molecular methods. Viral isolation methods are time consuming
and usually take a week [2,14]. Use of serological methods
by detecting viral anti-IgM anti-IgG can give false positive
results due to extensive antigenic cross-reactivity among
flavivirus as well as between different dengue virus serotypes [2,15-17]. Different types of polymerase chain reactions (PCR) like reverse -transcription PCR (RT-PCR),
real-time PCR and nested or hemi-nested PCR are used for
detecting genomic sequence for serotyping. Use of PCR
techniques is a quick and sensitive method for detecting
dengue virus and has replaced viral isolation techniques
[2,18].
Several outbreaks due to the dengue virus infection have
been reported from Pakistan [19-26]. Dengue infection was
first documented in Pakistan in year 1982 from Punjab in
which 12 patients out of total 174 were found positive for
dengue virus; all these samples were collected in1968 and
1978 [19]. The first outbreak of DHF was documented in
1994 by Chan and colleagues [21] who observed DEN-1
and DEN-2 in three out of ten tested patients for dengue
virus. In the following year, DEN-2 infection was reported
from the province of Balochistan [22,23]. Through serological studies, dengue type 1 and type 2 were found in sera
of children in Karachi [24,25]. Jamil and colleagues [20]
had previously been reported DEN-3 infection in 2005 outbreak of DHF in Karachi. Kan and colleagues [26] reported
co-circulation of dengue virus type 2 and type 3 in 2006
outbreak in Karachi. More recently, Hamayoun and colleagues [22] reported cases with dengue infection in the 2008
outbreak in Lahore. Out of 17 samples checked via realtime PCR, ten of their patients had DEN-4, five had DEN-2
and two had DEN-3 infection [22].
Pakistan has a history of outbreaks of dengue viral infection however, the responsible serotype/s is not well
known. Therefore, the current study was initiated to determine the circulating serotype/s of dengue virus in Pakistan
using molecular based techniques in patients’ sera. Samples were selected from stored repository from three most
recent outbreaks of dengue virus (2007-2009) and the
obtained sequences were compared to other dengue virus
sequences reported from other geographical regions of the
world to deduce a phylogenetic relationship.

Results
Serotyping of analyzed sample

A total of 114 suspected dengue serum samples along
with demographic data were kindly donated by Gurki

Trust Hospital Lahore and Sheikh Zayed Medical Complex Lahore for the current study. These samples were
collected during three different mini outbreaks of dengue virus infection in years 2007, 2008 and 2009 and
were stored at -20°C. Nested PCR was utilized for this
serotype analysis. Out of total 114 tested serum samples,
20 were found positive for dengue virus RNA with various serotypes. Table 1 shows the distribution of dengue
virus serotypes in the study population. It is clear from
the results of the current study that, of the 20 dengue
virus positive samples, six had concurrent infection with
two different dengue virus serotypes at a time generating data of 26 serotypes.
Nucleotide sequences analysis

The amplified bands of each sample were gel eluted and
were further used for sequence analysis. Junction of
C-prM gene of dengue virus isolates was chosen for serotyping. Accession numbers of these 26 studied sequences
are [GenBank: HQ385930-HQ385943 and HM626119HM626130]. The length of amplified product was 403
base pairs (bp) for serotype 2 and 453 bp for serotype 3.
The BLAST search was done and the sequences of serotype 2 were found close to a Sri Lankan strain [GenBank:
GQ252676] with an average of 99% homology. The
sequences of serotype 3 were close to a Chinese strain
[GenBank: GU363549] with an average homology of 99%.
These two strains were taken as prototypes for respective
serotypes. The C-prM fragment of serotype 2 was found
to be rich in AG composition with an average percentage
of 32.7% and 25.4% respectively. The C-prM gene junction
of serotype 3 was also found AG rich with an average percentage of 29.3% for A and 25.1% for G.
Further the obtained nucleotide sequences were translated using the BioEdit software. Translated results showed
that amino acid tyrosine is not present in the polyprotein
fragment of serotype 2. This region is rich in leucine with
an average of 12.78% followed by arginine (10.64%). The
polyprotein fragment of serotype 3 was found rich in leucine (12.58%) and lysine with an average of 10.67%.
Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis
of the sequences

Phylogenetic tree was conducted using the MEGA 4 software and multiple sequence alignment was deduced by
using BioEdit software. A region corresponding to nt122523 (401-bp) of the prototype was aligned for sequences of
serotype 2. Similarly region of nt158-609 (451-bp) was
aligned for the sequences of serotype 3. Regions of both of
the serotypes were not hyper variable. No insertions or
deletions were seen in the regions of both serotypes. A
slight variation in nucleotide sequences and translated
polyprotein sequences was observed for sequences of serotype 2. The serotype 3 sequences were almost identical

and same type of polyprotein was translated from the
nucleotide sequences. Phylogenetic analysis was constructed among the sequenced isolates as well with different geographical isolates sequences. The sequences were
retrieved from GenBank data base and 35 diverse
sequences from different geographical regions were
selected for serotype 2. For serotype 3, eleven sequences
from different geographical regions of the world and 3
sequences from Pakistan were selected. A 329-bp region
(nt194-522 of prototype 2) for serotype 2 and 219-bp
region (nt200-418 of prototype-3) for serotype 3 was chosen. On constructing the tree, the sequenced serotype 2
lied in the category of genotype IV (Figure 1). The
sequences fall in genotype IV with northern Indian strains.
As there are no submitted sequences of genotype II and
IV for capsid region of serotype 3, so the tree was constructed using sequences from genotype I and III. But the
tree clearly showed that the studied sequences of serotype
3 had genotype III (Figure 2). They fall in the same genotype with Indian strains and other three Pakistani strains
from Karachi.

Discussion
Over the years dengue fever has become an important
arboviral infection in different geographical regions of the
world that supports the growth of mosquitoes. Its range
exceeds over a hundred tropical and subtropical countries
with more than 2.5 billion people at the risk of infection
[12]. Pakistan has witnessed some severe outbreaks of dengue viral infection leading to significant morbidity and
mortality since 1994 [20,21]. Since the publication of a
study in 1982 documenting dengue infection from the
years 1968 and 1978 [19], several mini outbreaks of dengue viral infection have been reported. No doubt all the
four distinct serotypes, DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, and DEN4 of dengue virus have been reported as the cause of dengue infection; however, serotypes DEN-2 and DEN-3
remained the major cause of infection in humans worldwide. Like other parts of the world, in the current study
we have observed that serotypes DEN-2 and DEN-3 are
the predominant serotypes in dengue infection in outbreaks of 2007, 2008 and 2009 in Pakistan. In 2007, serotype DEN-2 prevailed with less occurrence of serotype
DEN-3. In samples of 2008 and 2009, serotype DEN-3 has

been isolated, though first incidence of serotype 3 infections was reported by Jamil and colleagues [20] in year
2005 outbreak in Karachi. This shows that serotype 3 is
new comer to this region as was isolated for the first time
in year 2005. All the previous outbreaks have been attributed to other serotypes. From Lahore, Hamayoun and colleagues [21] reported only serotype DEN-3 in 2008
outbreak and they were unable to isolate any other serotype. This finding of Hamayoun [21] confirms the results
of our study as serotype 3 is the only serotype we have
seen from stored samples of that particular outbreak of
2008.
In the present study we were able to characterize a very
low number of suspected dengue samples (17.5%; 20 samples out of 114) on molecular level. This may be due to the
reason that majority of samples were collected from suspected gangue virus infected patients in post viremic
phase. For the correct molecular characterization of the
virus, samples should be collected in acute phase of infection. Presentation of patients in post viremic phase or
lower rate of viral isolation may be the reason of getting
only twenty samples with positive results for dengue virus
[4]. Use of serum sample for viral isolation has been advocated previously in many studies [4,7,27] so we extracted
viral RNA using sera samples. The region of C-prM gene
junction was selected for serotyping as the region is not
very hyper variable and most of the mutations reported are
of silent type [12]. Lifecycle of dengue virus involves both
human and mosquitoes and this might be the reason for
low rate of variation among dengue virus as compared to
other RNA viruses. According to several reports, the classification of dengue genotypes is based on less than 6% of
nucleotide divergence within a selected genomic region
[12,28]. Dendrograms were drawn to study the evolutionary history of the sequenced serotypes as well as their
genotypes which showed that serotype 2 circulating in
2007-2009 belonged to genotype IV. Strains from Northern India, China and Indonesia also fall in this subtype
[12]. No particular pattern of genotype distribution can be
inferred for serotype 2 as different genotypes spread in
diverse locations. For serotype 3, only sequences of capsid
region from genotype I and III are reported. So the tree
was created using global sequences of genotype I and III
only. However, the tree visibly shows that the studied

our study that there is no definite pattern of distribution of
subtype III of dengue virus 3 worldwide [4]. The previously

serotypes 2 and 3 in their respective subtypes. The only
limitation of this study is small number of sequenced samples. There is a need for more randomized and multi-analysis studies to be conducted on serotyping and subtyping
of different dengue strains in Pakistan; in this way a clearer
view on spread of dengue virus can be made.

Conclusions
Based on the findings of the current study we conclude
that the predominant serotypes of dengue virus circulating in Pakistan are 2 and 3. Ample number of cases
with mixed serotypes (serotype 2 and 3) are seen and
might be common in all regions of this country. The

major genotypes circulated in the study period are subtype IV of dengue virus 2 and subtype III of dengue
virus 3.

Methods
Patients Samples and Extraction of viral RNA

A total of 114 serum samples were received from Gurki
Trust hospital Lahore and Sheikh Zayed Medical Complex
Lahore. Viral RNA was extracted from 140 μl of serum
sample using Nucleospin Viral RNA Extraction Kit
(Macherey-Nagel, Germany) with slight modifications.
Briefly, 600 μl of lysis buffer was added to 140 μl of serum
sample and vortexed for few seconds. Then the samples
were incubated at 70°C for 5 minutes. Then 600 μl of
absolute alcohol was added. The sample was loaded in the
column tube and centrifuged at 13000 rpm for one minute. A 500 μl of buffer RAW was added and centrifuged at
13000 rpm for 5 minutes. Then the sample was washed
with 200 μl of buffer RAV3 by centrifugation at 13000
rpm for 2 minutes. Ethanol was completely removed by
spinning the column for 1 minute. The column was incubated for 5 minutes at 70°C. Finally RNA was eluted in
50 μl of elution buffer and stored at -70°C till further use.
The subjects gave informed consent and the study was
conducted in accordance with the 1964 Declaration of
Helsinki and Guidelines for Good Clinical Research Practice in Pakistan. The study was approved by Ethics Committee of Molecular Virology Division.
Primer designing

Dengue group-specific degenerative primers were designed
according to the primer sequences targeting C-prM gene
junction described by Lanciotti et al [29]. Serotype-specific
primers were designed using Primer3 software (Table 2).
The amplified product size for specific serotypes were
411-bp for serotype-1, 403-bp for serotype-2, 453-bp for
serotype-3 and 401-bp for serotype-4.
Complementary DNA synthesis

Complementary DNA (cDNA) from viral RNA was
synthesized using 10 μl (from 20-50 ng) of extracted RNA
with a reaction mixture of 10 μl containing 4 μl 5 × First
Strand Buffer, 0.5 μl 0.1 M Dithiothriotol, 2 μl 10 mM
dNTPs, 1 μl 20 pM anti-sense primer and 1.3 μl dH2O
with 0.2 μl RNase inhibitor (8 units) and 1 μl (200 units)
of M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase Enzyme (Invitrogen Biotechnologies USA). The 20 μl total mixes was incubated at
37°C for 50 minutes followed by 2 minutes heat inactivation of M-MLV at 95°C. The samples were then incubated
for 2 minutes at 22°C.
Nested Polymerase Chain reaction

Nested PCR was used for serotyping analysis of samples.
For amplification of cDNA, 5 μl of cDNA (50-100 ng)

Page 6 of 8

was used with 15 μl of PCR mix containing 2 μl 10 ×
PCR Buffer, 2.4 μl MgCl 2 (from 25 mM stock), 1 μl
500 μM dNTPs, 1 μl 20 pM forward and reverse primer
each, 5.6 μl dH2O and 2 unites of Taq-DNA polymerase
enzyme (Invitrogen Biotechnologies USA). The thermal
profile for first round (using outer sense D1-D and antisense D2-D) was: initial denaturation at 94°C for 2 minutes followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for
45 seconds, annealing at 52°C for 45 seconds and extension at 72°C for 2 minutes. A final extension was given at
72°C for 10 minutes. The thermal profile for second
round using the type-specific sense and anti-sense primers was same to the thermal profile of first round, only
the annealing was carried out at 54°C for 45 seconds in
35 cycles.
Gel elution

The PCR product (nested PCR) was run on 2% agarose
gel. Gel purification was done using the QIAquick Gel
Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Germany) and the purified product was eluted in 30 μl of double distilled water which
was used as a template for sequencing reaction
Sequencing reaction and ethanol precipitation

Sequencing analysis was performed on automated genetic
analyser according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Big
Dye Deoxy Terminators; Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt,
Germany). Concentration of 25 ng of eluted DNA was
used for sequencing PCR reaction. Briefly, 10 μl reaction
mixture was prepared using 0.6 μl of BigDye, 1.5 μl 5×
sequencing buffer, 1.5 μl (about 25 ng) template, 1 μl
20 pM sense or anti-sense primer and 5.4 μl of dH2O. The
amplification steps in thermal cycler were: initial denaturation at 96°C for one minute followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 96°C for 15 seconds, annealing at 50°C for
10 seconds and extension at 60°C for 4 minutes. Final
extension was given at 60°C for 4 minutes. Ethanol precipitation of sequencing PCR product was carried out by
adding 2 μl 3 M sodium acetate, 2 μl 125 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and 26 μl of absolute alcohol.
The mixture was put at room temperature for 15-20 minutes. It was centrifuged for 30 minutes at 3800 rpm at 4°C.
Thirty-six micro litres of 70% ethanol was added to dry
pellet and centrifuged for 15 minutes at 3800 rpm. Finally
12 μl of formamide was added to dried pellet and mixed
well. It was followed by heat shock at 95°C for 5 minutes
and was loaded onto automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems, 3100 DNA Analyzer) for sequence analysis.
Nucleotide and amino acid sequence analysis

The obtained sequences were edited and BLAST search
was conducted to confirm the identity of the sequences.
The amino acid sequences were translated using BioEdit
v7.0.5 software and also it was used to align amino acid
