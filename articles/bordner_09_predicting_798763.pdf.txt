Abstract
Background: Many integral membrane proteins, like their non-membrane counterparts, form
either transient or permanent multi-subunit complexes in order to carry out their biochemical
function. Computational methods that provide structural details of these interactions are needed
since, despite their importance, relatively few structures of membrane protein complexes are
available.
Results: We present a method for predicting which residues are in protein-protein binding sites
within the transmembrane regions of membrane proteins. The method uses a Random Forest
classifier trained on residue type distributions and evolutionary conservation for individual surface
residues, followed by spatial averaging of the residue scores. The prediction accuracy achieved for
membrane proteins is comparable to that for non-membrane proteins. Also, like previous results
for non-membrane proteins, the accuracy is significantly higher for residues distant from the
binding site boundary. Furthermore, a predictor trained on non-membrane proteins was found to
yield poor accuracy on membrane proteins, as expected from the different distribution of surface
residue types between the two classes of proteins. Thus, although the same procedure can be used
to predict binding sites in membrane and non-membrane proteins, separate predictors trained on
each class of proteins are required. Finally, the contribution of each residue property to the overall
prediction accuracy is analyzed and prediction examples are discussed.
Conclusion: Given a membrane protein structure and a multiple alignment of related sequences,
the presented method gives a prioritized list of which surface residues participate in intramembrane
protein-protein interactions. The method has potential applications in guiding the experimental
verification of membrane protein interactions, structure-based drug discovery, and also in
constraining the search space for computational methods, such as protein docking or threading,
that predict membrane protein complex structures.

Background
Integral membrane proteins constitute a significant fraction of all proteins in sequenced organisms and also are
targets of slightly more than half of all current drugs [1,2].
Similar to non-membrane proteins, many membrane proteins form complexes in order to carry out their biological

function. Structural details of these protein-protein interactions can aid in generating experimentally verifiable
mechanistic hypotheses for the relevant complexes and
also can form a basis for the structure-based discovery of
therapeutics to modulate these interactions. However,
high-resolution experimental structures of membrane

protein complexes are relatively scarce (< 1% of all Protein
Data Bank structures), due to technical difficulties in
obtaining X-ray or NMR structures [3]. Also, even with an
available structure, the annotation of the biological complex in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) file may be incorrect
[4]. Furthermore, even as new techniques are developed
to speed up the experimental determination of membrane
protein structures, the combinatorial nature of proteinprotein interactions precludes solving the structures of all
possible protein complexes from an organism's proteome.
Computational methods can address these challenges by
providing predictions of which residues on the protein
surface participate in protein-protein interactions. These
predictions can be subsequently verified by, for example,
mutagenesis experiments. The predictions can also be
used as constraints for predicting the structure of the protein complex by, for example, protein-protein docking.
Existing computational methods for predicting proteinprotein binding sites can be broadly classified into those
that utilize only 1D sequence information and those that
require some information about the 3D protein structure.
Sequence-only methods [5-8] have the advantage that
they can be applied to proteins for which no experimental
structures are available and no close templates can be
found for comparative modeling. However, structure provides additional information that helps distinguish binding site residues, such as solvent accessibility and the
proximity of residues in 3D space. Because of these additional signals, prediction methods that incorporate this
information generally perform better than sequence-only
methods, although the use of different data sets and interface residue definitions prevents a direct comparison.
Many previous structure-based methods used either scoring functions [9-11], artificial neural networks (ANNs)
[12-15], or Support Vector Machines (SVMs) [16-18]
trained on various properties within roughly circular surface patches to predict protein-protein binding sites. Two
exceptions are a study that limited the predictions to surface pockets [19] and a recent study that used a Random
Forest trained on residue types and properties within a
sliding 9-residue window for prediction [20].
Here we consider the problem of predicting protein-protein binding sites within the intramembrane region of
integral membrane proteins. The previous studies mentioned above were limited to non-membrane proteins, for
which considerably more experimental structures are
available. Nonetheless, we find that there are currently a
sufficient number of structures for training and validating
a predictor that achieves accuracy comparable to our previous results for non-membrane proteins [18]. There are
large differences in the frequencies of residue types on the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/312

surfaces of membrane and non-membrane proteins due
to their hydrophobic and hydrophilic environments,
respectively. This means that separate predictors, trained
only on data from their respective class of proteins (membrane or non-membrane), are needed. The prediction
method employs a Random Forest trained on residue frequencies in a multiple alignment of related protein
sequences and the evolutionary rates of each site. Random
Forest predictions are first made for individual surface residues and then these are averaged over a local surface
region in order to arrive at the final prediction. This procedure was found to yield better accuracy than directly
including the properties of surrounding residues in the
training data, as was done in previous machine learning
based methods. In addition, we compared the residue
properties between protein-protein binding sites and the
remaining surface and also between membrane and nonmembrane proteins in order to discern which properties
contribute to the prediction in each case. Also, we examined the relative contribution of each property to the overall prediction accuracy and considered examples of
predictions for particular membrane proteins.

Methods
Benchmark set of membrane protein complex structures
A diverse set of alpha-helical membrane protein complex
structures was first compiled for training and testing the
prediction method. Monomers as well as multimeric complexes were included. The initial set of PDB entries for
alpha-helical membrane proteins were taken from the
PDBTM database [21,22]. A non-redundant subset of protein complexes, for which no pair of complexes have all
proteins differing by less than 30% sequence identity,
were then selected from each initial set of structures. Information on generating the biological complex in the PDB
structure files (the BIOMT record) was used as an initial
guess of the complex structure. Because this information
is sometimes erroneous [4,23], it was compared with the
literature and the structure of the complete protein complex was corrected where necessary.

Next, a set of non-redundant proteins, each of which contacts at least one other protein in a complex, was extracted
from these structures. Because the individual proteins are
taken from structures of protein complexes, their proteinprotein binding sites are known. This set of protein structures was then used to train the prediction method and to
assess its accuracy. The same procedure was also used to
build a set of beta barrel membrane protein complex
structures as well as a non-redundant set of proteins taken
from these complexes with known protein-protein binding sites. Finally, the alpha-helical and beta barrel sets
were combined to make the membrane protein benchmark set.

The final set of membrane protein complexes contained
64 alpha-helical multimeric protein complexes comprised
of 149 unique subunits, 17 alpha-helical monomeric
complexes, 14 beta barrel homomultimeric complexes,
and 23 beta barrel monomers. The details of this benchmark set are provided as additional file 1 accompanying
this article.
Training data
Only surface residues, with relative solvent accessible surface area (SASA) â¥ 0.2, that are also within the hydrophobic core of the membrane are considered and so included
in the training data. The relative SASA is calculated by
dividing the residue SASA by the value for the same residue type in an extended conformation surrounded by glycine residues. Residues in the membrane core have zcoordinates with |z| â¤ 15 Ã, in which the z-axis is perpendicular to the plane of the membrane predicted by
PDBTM and the origin is in the center of the membrane.
In other words, the membrane core was assumed to be 30
Ã thick, which is in agreement with the approximate values from PDBTM predictions and experimental results on
lipid bilayers [24].

Random Forest predictions were made for each individual
residue based on its properties. The training data for each
residue consisted of frequencies of each of the 20 standard
residues in a multiple sequence alignment of similar
sequences and the evolutionary rate. The sequence alignments were created by searching for similar protein
sequences in the NCBI nr database with BLAST [25] at an
E-value cutoff of 10-2, removing redundant sequences at
the 90% sequence identity level using the CD-HIT program [26], and generating multiple alignments of the
remaining sequences with MUSCLE [27]. Only proteins
with at least 20 sequences in the final alignment were
included in the training set. This criterion reduced the
number of unique proteins included in the training data
to 128. The residue frequency for a particular residue type
was simply calculated as the fraction of residues of that
type in the corresponding multiple sequence alignment
column. The evolutionary rate, which varies inversely
with conservation, was calculated using the REVCOM
method [28]. Because REVCOM accounts for the evolutionary relationships between the protein sequences via
an inferred phylogenetic tree, the resulting evolutionary
conservation values are more robust to the particular set
of sequences and local alignment errors than methods
that do not, such as the column entropy. Finally, each surface residue was labeled as either a binding site residue, if
it contacted another protein chain in the complex structure (< 4 Ã non-H atom separation), or otherwise as a
non-binding site residue.

Most machine learning classifier methods, include Random Forests, perform better on balanced input data that
has a comparable number of positive and negative examples. Because of this, negative (non-binding site) examples were randomly chosen from the negative data such
that there were an equal number of positive and negative
examples in the training data. After training the Random
Forest classifier on a balanced subset of the training data,
predictions were made for all data in the (unbalanced)
test set. The input data contained a total of 2391 positive
examples for binding site residues.
Random Forests
A Random Forest binary classifier was trained on the
labeled residue data and used to predict whether or not
each intramembrane surface residue is in a protein-protein binding site. The Random Forest method [29] was
chosen because it is fast and achieves competitive accuracy
on standard test classification problems. In addition,
unlike the popular alternative methods of Support Vector
Machines (SVMs) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs),
it can utilize heterogeneous training data without rescaling and can also efficiently estimate the contribution of
each variable to the prediction performance.

The overall prediction performance was evaluated by 10fold cross-validation in which the data was randomly
divided into 10 approximately equal size sets and predictions were made for each set in turn using a Random Forest trained on the data in the remaining 9 sets. The data
was divided so that all residue data for a particular protein
was contained entirely within one set. This insures that
the predictions are made for a distinct set of proteins from
those used to train the Random Forest classifier so that
one obtains an accurate estimate of the prediction performance for novel data.
Briefly, a Random Forest is a set of decision trees in which
the input data for each tree is randomized in two ways, by
using a random subset of the total variables and by using
a bootstrap sample of the data. The two main parameters
in the method are the total number of trees and the
number of variables per tree. Because the Random Forest
generalization error converges to an asymptotic value as
more trees are added, increasing the number of trees does
not generally lead to worse overfitting [29]. For the binding site residue prediction, a total of 2000 trees in the Random Forest were found to be sufficient, since adding
further trees did not significantly improve the prediction
performance but increased the calculation time. Also the
number of variables per tree was set at two because this
gave the highest cross-validation accuracy. The accuracy
showed little change upon varying this parameter. The
prediction score, which varied from 0.0 to 1.0, was calcu-

dues and the unfavorable energy of burying charged residues in the interface.

The open source Random Forest implementation in the R
[30] package randomForest [31] were used for all predictions. Statistical analysis was also performed in the R software environment.

A different trend in residue frequencies is expected for the
intramembrane portion of membrane proteins because
their surfaces are contacting the hydrocarbon tails of the
lipid molecules comprising the membrane so that hydrophobic residues are energetically favorable on the exposed
protein surface. Statistical tests using the benchmark set
revealed that intramembrane protein-protein binding
sites have higher frequencies of phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine residues and lower frequencies of
valine residues than the remaining intramembrane protein surface (p < 0.05; Wilcoxon paired sign-rank tests
with multiple testing corrections). In addition, residues
occurring within protein-protein binding sites in membrane proteins have lower evolutionary rates, or equivalently higher conservation, than residues on the
remaining intramembrane surface (p < 2.2 Ã 10-16, Wilcoxon rank sum test).

Prediction confidence
As in our previous studies [18,32], the confidence of the
prediction for each residue was calculated from the score
as the ratio of the class conditional likelihoods

R ( score ) =

p ( score|binding site residue )
p ( score|non-binding site residue )

The likelihoods in the numerator and denominator were
calculated using Gaussian kernel density estimation of the
scores in each respective class. A high value of R for a residue indicates that it is confidently predicted to be in a
binding site, a low value indicates that it is confidently
predicted to be outside of binding sites, and an intermediate value indicates an ambiguous prediction. The R values
are useful for prioritizing the predictions before undertaking time-consuming and costly experimental validation.

Results and Discussion
Distinguishing characteristics of intramembrane proteinprotein binding sites
Throughout this section we consider only the intramembrane portion of membrane protein complexes since the
general properties of the solvated portions of the complexes, specifically both binding site and non-binding site
surfaces, are expected to have similar properties to those
of cytosolic proteins. The membrane core was defined to
extend 15 Ã in both directions perpendicular to the central membrane plane predicted by the TMDET method
and available from the PDBTM database. The TMDET
method accounts for both the protein backbone geometry
and hydrophobicity in order to predict the extent and orientation of the membrane relative to the protein complex.
TMDET uses the structure of the complex, and so incorporates the geometrical constraints that all transmembrane
segments are delimited by two common membrane
boundaries. This is an advantage over sequence-only prediction methods, when experimental structures are available.

Protein-protein binding sites on cytosolic proteins have
different distributions of residue types on average than
those on the exposed protein surface. Specifically proteinprotein binding sites are enriched in large hydrophobic
and uncharged polar residues and are depleted of charged
residues [18,33]. This can be partially explained by the
favorable solvation energy of burying hydrophobic resi-

Spatial Averaging of Scores
Our previous method for predicting protein-protein binding sites [18], as well as those of others [12-14,16],
included the properties of neighboring residues in the
training data. We found that this resulted in better performance than using only the properties of each individual residue. One explanation for the improved accuracy is
that the binding sites are contiguous regions on the protein surface so that a given residue in a binding site is
likely to be surrounded by other binding site residues.
Likewise, surface residues outside of the binding sites are
likely to be surrounded by other non-binding site residues. In other words, the binding site residues are spatially clustered and not randomly scattered about the
surface. Including data for neighboring residues then provides additional independent information that improves
the prediction accuracy.

We also investigated spatial averaging of Random Forest
scores from predictions using only data from single residues and found that it gave slightly better performance
than including properties for neighboring residues in
training data (data not shown). For a given surface residue, the average score, Savg, was calculated as a linearly
weighted average over the scores, Si, for all residues with
CÎ± separations from the central residue, ri, less than rmax

in which the summations are over all residues within the
cutoff distance, rmax. The score of the central residue has a
weight of 1 while a residue at the cutoff distance would
have the minimum weight, wmin. Thus the scores for residues closest to the central one make a larger contribution
to the average score Savg than those further away. The best
values for the two adjustable parameters, which resulted
in the highest AUC, were chosen by a grid search. The
optimal values were found to be rmax = 18 Ã and wmin = 0.1.
Overall Prediction Accuracy
The overall prediction accuracy of the method was
assessed by the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve for cross-validation results. The ROC
curve is a plot of the sensitivity, or true positive rate, versus
(1 - specificity), or false positive rate, and displays the
tradeoff between these two quantities as the prediction
score cutoff is varied. AUC can vary between 0.0 and 1.0.
A value of 1.0 indicates perfect accuracy whereas a value
near 0.5 indicates poor prediction performance.

The ROC curve for the cross-validation prediction results
is shown in Figure 1. The AUC for this curve is 0.75. This
is only slightly lower than the AUC value of 0.79 that we
obtained for a set of non-membrane proteins using our
previous method [18]. The similar prediction performance for membrane and non-membrane proteins shows
that (1) there is a comparably strong signal in the training
data that can be used to discriminate binding site and
non-binding site residues and (2) there is sufficient training data for membrane proteins.

It is tempting to use the larger quantity of protein-protein
binding site data for non-membrane proteins in order to
train a predictor for membrane proteins. This was directly
tested by training the same prediction method described
above on data from a non-redundant set of 4296 nonmembrane proteins, sharing less than 30% sequence
identity, and making predictions for the membrane protein benchmark set data. The AUC for the prediction was
only 0.36. This AUC value is actually less than the random
expected value of 0.5 because the prediction results are
anticorrelated, i.e. binding site residues are more often
predicted as non-binding site residues and vice versa. One
explanation of the anticorrelation is that whereas hydrophobic residues are more prevalent in non-membrane
protein binding sites they are instead more prevalent on
the lipid-exposed non-binding site surfaces of membrane
proteins. Likewise, hydrophilic residues are more prevalent on the solvent-exposed non-binding site surface of
non-membrane proteins whereas they are more prevalent
in the protein-protein binding sites of membrane proteins. This result confirms the expectation that the different frequencies of surface residue types for membrane and
non-membrane proteins, resulting from the different
physiochemical environments of proteins in each class,
implies that separate predictors trained on the same class
of proteins (membrane or non-membrane) are required
in order to achieve good prediction accuracy.
Also we found in our previous study [18] that central protein-protein binding site residues had higher prediction
reliability than those near the periphery of the binding
site. This was attributed to two factors: (1) the 14 nearest
residues, whose properties are included in the training
data, are more likely to also be within the binding site and
so provide additional independent data to improve the
prediction accuracy, (2) there is some ambiguity in the
binding site boundary depending on how the binding site
is defined (for example, based on loss of SASA upon forming a complex or intermolecular atomic contacts), and (3)
central residues had greater evolutionary conservation
than peripheral binding site residues, resulting in a
stronger signal.
Here we define a core residue as one for which all other
residues within a CÎ± separation distance of 8 Ã belong to
the same class (binding site residue or non-binding site
residue). Thus core residues can be either inside or outside
of the binding sites but are not near the binding site
boundaries. The AUC for the core residues alone was 0.86,
which is considerably higher than when residues near the
binding site boundaries are included. This is consistent
with the results of the earlier study, although that study
only examined core residues within protein-protein binding sites. However, unlike that study, there was no significant difference in the evolutionary conservation between

BMC Bioinformatics 2009, 10:312

the core and peripheral (non-core) binding site residues.
This implies that the last factor (#3), mentioned above,
that contributes to improved prediction performance for
core residues in cytosolic proteins does not contribute for
membrane proteins. However, the remaining two factors
(#1 and #2) probably also contribute to the improved
accuracy for core residues in membrane proteins.
Relative Importance of Residue Properties to Prediction
Accuracy
Because Random Forests use a bootstrap sample to train
each classification tree, the remaining unused, or so-called
out-of-bag, data can be used to obtain an estimate of each
individual variable's contribution to the overall prediction accuracy [29]. This is accomplished by calculating the
mean decrease in accuracy for the out-of-bag data upon
randomly shuffling the values for the variable of interest.
The results for membrane proteins are plotted in Figure
2a.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/312

Comparison of Figure 2a with Figure 3a shows that the
importance of each residue type is roughly correlated with
its frequency of occurrence. The residue types contributing
the most to the accuracy, namely alanine, leucine, glycine,
and valine, are among the residues occurring most frequently in the intramembrane region of membrane proteins. Likewise, the least important residue types for the
prediction, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and glutamine,
are some of the least frequently occurring residues in the
membrane region. A similar comparison between figures
2b and 3b reveals the same trend for non-membrane proteins. Specifically, the residues contributing the most to
accuracy, namely lysine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and
arginine, are some of the most prevalent surface residues
and the residues contributing the least to the prediction
accuracy, tryptophan and cysteine, are the least frequently
occurring surface residues in non-membrane proteins.

residue type in a multiple sequence alignment of related proteins (indicated by the residue type abbreviation) and the evolutionary rate. A higher fractional decrease in accuracy indicates that the property contributes more to the prediction accuracy.

Although the quantity of training data for membrane proteins is considerably less than for non-membrane proteins, the fact that the importance of the column residue
frequencies exhibit the same dependence on their frequencies of occurrence suggests that this trend is not due
to a lack of sufficient data. Rather, the simplest interpretation of these trends is that the overall abundance of each
residue type, which determines how prevalent the residue
type is in the training data, generally dominates any differences in residue frequencies between each class (binding
site and non-binding site residues). For example, even
though the statistical tests showed that tyrosine residues
are more prevalent in binding sites whereas leucine residues are not, the column frequencies of leucine residues
are more important than those of tyrosine residues
because the training data contains significantly more leucine residues, thus giving them a larger contribution to the
overall prediction accuracy.

Prediction Examples
We next briefly examine two examples in which the protein-protein binding site predictions aid in identifying or
confirming the correct biologically relevant complex from
X-ray structures. Again, cross-validation predictions, in
which the predictor was trained on data for dissimilar protein complexes, were used in order to provide a realistic
assessment of the prediction performance.
Figure 4 shows the protein-protein binding site prediction
for an ammonium transport (Amt) protein from Nitrosomonas europaea (PDB entry 3B9W[34]). This NeRH50
protein is a rare bacterial homolog of the human Rhesus
(Rh) group antigens, RhD and RhCE, and Rh-associated
glycoprotein RhAG. Along with the ABO system, the Rh
antigens are the most clinically important antigens in
blood transfusions. The authors who determined the Amt
structure concluded that it is homotrimeric, based on
their observation of a tightly packed trimer generated by
the threefold crystallographic symmetry axis. Because of
the homology between Amt and human Rh50 proteins
they suggested that the Rh50 are also homotrimeric, in
contrast with earlier experimental studies that concluded
that they likely form heterotetramers with RhD or RhCE
[35,36]. As can be seen in the figure, the confidently predicted binding residues on one subunit agree with the
interfaces in the proposed trimeric biological complex,
thus confirming the conclusion of Ref. [34] for the
NeRH50 complex. Importantly, the remaining protein
surface outside the binding site is also confidently predicted not to contain other binding site residues. Binding
site predictions were also made for homology models of
RhD, RhCE, and RhD obtained from MODBASE. They
showed qualitatively similar results to those for NeRH50,
except for a slightly larger predicted binding patch (data
not shown). The similar results are probably due to the
relatively high sequence similarity (~30-35%) between

site predictions do not rule out a tetrameric human Rh
complex they provide a prioritized list of potential binding site residues that can be experimentally tested.

Figure 5 shows the binding site prediction for an archaeal
Site-2 Protease (S2P) family intramembrane metalloprotease (PDB entry 3B4R[37]). Although a few isolated residues near the membrane-solvent interface have high
scores, there are no contiguous predicted binding patches
on the intramembrane surface. This implies that the pro-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/312

tein is likely to be a monomer and not a homodimer, as
the BIOMT annotation indicates. The substrate peptide
binding site does not appear in the prediction because it
is buried in this presumably closed conformation of the
protease. This example also suggests that post-processing
to remove small predicted binding site patches, as was
done for non-membrane proteins in Ref. [18], would
remove spurious binding patches, e.g. small molecule
binding sites, that are too small to be protein binding
sites, and so may improve prediction accuracy.

Conclusion
The protein-protein binding site prediction method for
membrane proteins described in this study was found to
yield accuracy that was comparable to that for non-membrane proteins. Although there are considerably fewer
experimental structures of membrane proteins than nonmembrane proteins, because the predictions are made for
individual surface residues there is a sufficient quantity of
independent examples for training a Random Forest classifier that gives accurate results. Also, as expected from the
different occurrence frequencies of surface residue types in
membrane and non-membrane proteins, a predictor
trained on non-membrane proteins gave poor accuracy
when applied to membrane proteins. Thus separate predictors for membrane and non-membrane proteins are
needed. In addition, a prediction procedure that is different than the ones used in previous studies was found to
give better accuracy. Random Forest predictions were first
made for individual surface residues and then the resulting scores of nearby residues were averaged in order to
arrive at the final prediction score. Predictions could not
be made for some proteins due to an insufficient number
of related protein sequences needed for the multiple
sequence alignment, however this is expected to improve
with the rapidly growing number of available protein
sequences.

predicted to function as a monomer.

The prediction method presented here is expected to have
applications in guiding experimental investigations of
membrane protein interactions and also in the prediction
of protein complex structures using computational methods such as docking or threading. In addition to these
applications, several future areas of investigation are possible. First, because the method relies only on residuelevel information, it is expected to give accurate results for
homology models, which are generally correct for regions
with well-defined secondary structure but often have
errors in loops or side chain conformations. A study of the
prediction accuracy for homology models of varying quality would help quantify what accuracy can be expected.
Second, because the method relies on a multiple sequence
alignment of similar sequences, the choice of included
sequences can affect the final prediction accuracy. The
implicit assumption that the proteins with sequences in

the multiple alignment have the same protein-protein
binding site, may be incorrect, particularly if distantly
related sequences are included. It would be useful to have
a method for selecting the optimal set of sequences to
include in the alignment. Finally, contiguous binding
patches could be calculated from the individual residue
predictions. This would then give a lower bound on the
number of independent binding sites on the protein surface.
