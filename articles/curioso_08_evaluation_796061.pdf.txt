Abstract
Background: New technologies that emerge at the interface of computational and biomedical
science could drive new advances in global health, therefore more training in technology is needed
among health care workers. To assess the potential for informatics training using an approach
designed to foster interaction at this interface, the University of Washington and the Universidad
Peruana Cayetano Heredia developed and assessed a one-week course that included a new
Bioinformatics (BIO) track along with an established Medical/Public Health Informatics track (MI)
for participants in Peru.
Methods: We assessed the background of the participants, and measured the knowledge gained
by track-specific (MI or BIO) 30-minute pre- and post-tests. Participants' attitudes were evaluated
both by daily evaluations and by an end-course evaluation.
Results: Forty-three participants enrolled in the course – 20 in the MI track and 23 in the BIO
track. Of 20 questions, the mean % score for the MI track increased from 49.7 pre-test (standard
deviation or SD = 17.0) to 59.7 (SD = 15.2) for the post-test (P = 0.002, n = 18). The BIO track
mean score increased from 33.6 pre-test to 51.2 post-test (P < 0.001, n = 21). Most comments
(76%) about any aspect of the course were positive. The main perceived strength of the course was
the quality of the speakers, and the main perceived weakness was the short duration of the course.
Overall, the course acceptability was very good to excellent with a rating of 4.1 (scale 1–5), and
the usefulness of the course was rated as very good. Most participants (62.9%) expressed a positive
opinion about having had the BIO and MI tracks come together for some of the lectures.
Conclusion: Pre- and post-test results and the positive evaluations by the participants indicate
that this first joint Bioinformatics and Medical/Public Health Informatics (MI and BIO) course was
a success.

Background
In the last decade, the field of health informatics has experienced extraordinary growth, and the demand for health
professionals with skills in this area is growing [1].
Advances in global health may be increasingly driven by
new technologies that emerge at the interface of computational and biomedical science [2]. Bioinformatics initially was synonymous with DNA and protein sequence
data management and analysis, but now it has rapidly
expanded with the rapid progress in full genome
sequencing, functional genomics, pharmacogenomics,
proteomics, metabolomics research, and biopathway
modeling [3]. These approaches are providing great
insights into many questions about biology, evolution,
ecology, and public health. Despite the fact that a large
number of genome sequences are from pathogens that
represent a significant burden for global health, involvement of researchers from developing countries in
genome projects and timely development of bioinformatics capacity in these regions is rather limited [4]. In
the global context, bioinformatics is crucial to the future
of biotechnology for developing countries in promoting
more effective and efficient methods in understanding
the processes of disease and health, and in developing
new or better drugs.
In developed countries, medical informatics have been
taught over the last 20–25 years, and their successes and
setbacks have been well-documented, providing good
models for future course development [5-11]. In developing countries, however, training of health professionals in
informatics remains one of the biggest challenges. Inadequate education in informatics skills is a constraint
among medical students, doctors, nurses, and many other
health care professionals who have varying levels of computer competence [12-14]. In a study conducted by Horna
et al., 40% of a sample of medical students in Peru'
reported lack of proficiency on the use of Internet [15].
Similarly, in 2003, Samuel et al. reported that only 52%
of medical students in Tanzania felt that they understood
the basic terminology and concepts of computing. In
Nigeria, Ajuwon reported that only 42.6% of a sample
composed of medical and nursing students could use a
computer [13]. Another study conducted in Nigeria
reported that 79% of medical and dental students had little or no computer skills [16].
Some training experiences in health informatics have
been described from Latin-America, Africa, and Asia [1621], including on-line training [20], on-site and online
education [22], and even formal training in some academic curricula [23], but much more is needed. There is a
need for collaborative alliances or partnerships to enable
provision of global health informatics education [24].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6920/8/1

Peru, a middle income Latin American country, still faces
significant challenges to improving health for its people.
Much like other Latin American countries, Peru has infectious disease epidemics such as multi-drug resistant tuberculosis and malaria.
In Peru, formal master's or doctoral-level programs in
health informatics among universities are beginning, and
there is a lack of other health informatics training programs, such as short courses, certificates programs, and
diplomas. But Peru does offer the AMAUTA (Quechua
word for master) Global Informatics Research and Training Program for researchers in the region. AMAUTA is a
collaborative partnership between the Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia (UPCH) in Lima and the University of Washington in Seattle. The program is funded by
the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Fogarty International Center and the National Library of Medicine.
The University of Washington (UW) and its International
Training in Health Informatics Program (ITHIP) has twice
offered a two-week intensive short course in Lima (2000
and 2001) in collaboration with two schools of medicine
[18]. Those courses provided an introduction to medical
informatics. The AMAUTA program then organized an
advanced course entitled Informatics for Global Health:
Advances in Public Health and Genomics, which was held
in November 2005. This paper describes the evaluation of
the course.

Methods
Development of the course
The objectives of the course were as follows: 1) to present
the state-of-the-art developments in medical informatics,
public health informatics, and bioinformatics; 2) to
increase the knowledge of participants in the application
of recent information technology tools in medicine, public health, and biomedical investigation in Peru, 3) to enable participants to develop and strengthen collaborative
studies both locally and internationally; 4) to present and
summarize research projects on medical/public health
informatics and bioinformatics being conducted by Peruvian fellows (present and past) of the ITHIP, and, 5) to
improve the use of current informatics tools by the participants to form new working hypotheses, and to conduct
new collaborative research projects concerning global
health.

The course was structured in two parallel tracks: one with
a Bioinformatics focus (BIO), and one with a Medical
Informatics/Public Health Informatics focus (MI). The
Bioinformatics track was added due to the rapidly growing demand for bioinformatics training in Peru. Both
tracks had separate workshops and instruction but shared
several lectures. Topics were selected by course coordina-

tors and course faculty from UPCH and UW based on
feedback received from previous short courses and based
on research interests of the course faculty. We solicited
topics from Peruvian faculty based on the priorities for
institutional and content development. The course was
targeted for a wide-range of health-related professions: clinicians, nurses, biologists, bioinformaticians, librarians,
physicists, mathematicians, chemists, public health professionals, laboratory investigators, and health science
students.
For both the MI track and the computer laboratory sessions, a computer with Internet access was provided to
each participant for use during the course.

• Functional genomics1
• Parasite databases1
• Open source and free software: Relevance in biomedical
research1
• Using the Internet and computers as tools for STD/HIV

Participant selection
Of the more than 90 candidates who expressed interest in
the course, 64 submitted applications and 43 were
accepted. Applications were submitted online and
included a self-reported skills survey to determine computer proficiency. Five faculty members from UPCH selected
the participants. The criteria for selection included the
participant's affiliation with an academic institution,
experience with medical informatics and/or a bioinformatics project, relevant publications, and availability to
attend the full course. The participants were almost
equally divided between the tracks – 20 for Medical Informatics/Public Health Informatics and 23 for Bioinformatics. Full scholarships were offered for all participants.

Course Description
The MI track included five topics: Electronic Medical
Records, Genomics, Open Source, Organizational Issues
in Health Informatics, and Surveillance and Evaluation of
Health Informatics Systems. The BIO track included four
topics: Computational Biology, Drug Design, Organizational Issues in Health Informatics, and Genomics. The
BIO and MI tracks shared two topics in common – Organizational Issues in Health Informatics, and Genomics. A
complete list of topics is described below:

of questions concerning strengths, weaknesses, effectiveness, and general comments about the course.

A free public mini-symposium was presented at the beginning of the course. The course was conducted by five faculty members from UPCH, nine from the University of
Washington, two from Harvard University, and two from
the U.S. National Institutes of Health.

The daily evaluation, administered at the close of every
day, used a Likert scale (rating of 1 to 6 where 1 was very
poor and 6 was excellent) for each session with an area to
comment on each one. The end-of-course evaluation,
administered after the post-test, was composed of four
Likert scale questions as well as open-ended questions
inviting general thoughts on the course. Other items
asked respondents to rate the value of having attended the
course and to indicate preferences regarding topics for
future courses.

Novel technologies were used during the course. For
example, an interactive, wireless, PowerPoint compatible
device Audience Response System (TurningPoint®
Response Card RF) was used to engage students with questions that allowed them to gain insight from different people in real time. After students had responded to the
questions, results were immediately displayed graphically
on a PowerPoint slide that indicated the percentages students responded to each of the question alternatives.
During the course, we hosted two free public teleconference sessions: one on meta-analysis led by a speaker at the
University of Washington and one on grant writing led by
speakers at the U.S. National Institute of Health. For the
teleconference on meta-analysis, we used Macromedia
Breeze (Adobe Systems, Mountain View, Calif.), which
allowed participants to pull up a lecture using both video
and audio simultaneously. For the session on grant writing, we presented a PowerPoint presentation using the
software program Elluminate Live! (Elluminate, Ft.
Lauderdale, Fla.), which allowed simultaneously live
audio and sharing a whiteboard for notes.
The course Web site in Spanish was at: http://faculty.washington.edu/wcurioso/curso.htm

Evaluation
Knowledge
Students completed 30-minute pre- and post-tests specific
for each track (MI and BIO). Each test was paper-based
and consisted of 20 multiple-choice questions. The questions were selected from an original pool of 35 questions
developed from the subject matter to be covered by the
course. Questions on the pre and post-tests [see Additional file 1] were identical; however, the order of presentation of the individual items was randomly changed on
the pre-test. The students were not allowed access to the
examination outside the testing period to prevent unauthorized distribution of the questions.
Attitudes
Two systems were used to evaluate participant satisfaction: 1) A daily evaluation of each session based on
informative content, usefulness, and presentation techniques, and 2) an end-of-course evaluation that consisted

Follow-up Evaluation
A follow-up, confidential, Web-based survey was sent by
e-mail to all participants six months after conclusion of
the informatics course to evaluate the impact of the course
in their current work.

Included in the survey were questions asking respondents
if they were actively involved in health informatics or bioinformatics-related activities (i.e., project, teaching, etc.)
at the time of the six-month survey, whether they thought
the course had changed their vision of what health informatics is, and whether they used what they learned after
the course. Respondents were also asked to rate how useful the informatics course was, and if they were willing to
participate in a health-informatics diploma at UPCH.
They were also invited to provide additional comments.
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the course.
Paired t-tests and effect size measures were used to assess
knowledge improvement for each track. Effect size measures are useful in assessing and interpreting the magnitude of knowledge change, and complement t-tests, which
only assess the statistical significance of change. We used
Cohen's d statistic, which was obtained by dividing the
difference between the pre- and post-test means by the
within-group standard deviation, and provide a standardized measure of change [25]. A Cohen's d value of 0.20
indicates a small effect size, 0.50 a medium effect size and
0.80 indicates a large effect size [25]. The test scores from
the pre-tests and post-tests were entered into computer
files using the social science statistical software (SPSS version 13). Data are presented as mean (standard deviation
or SD) scores or numbers (percentages). Paired t tests were
used to determine whether there had been a statistically
significant change between the pre- and post-test scores.
For all tests, significance level was α = 0.05.

Qualitative data from the daily evaluation sessions and
final group evaluations were analyzed separately. The

results from each evaluation provided descriptive information about how participants experienced the course.

Results
Participants
Of the 43 participants, 27 (63%) were male. Professional
backgrounds of the participants varied between tracks.
The 20 Medical Informatics track participants were more
diverse: nine were physicians, three informatics engineers,
three librarians, one midwife, one nutritionist, one nurse,
one public health worker, and one statistician.

Of the 23 participants of the BIO track, 15 were biologists,
three pharmacists, two physicists, one chemist, one informatics engineer, and one mathematician. Most of the participants were affiliated with the UPCH; others came from
other medical institutions, non-governmental agencies,
and the Ministry of Health. Two of the participants were
not Peruvians: one was from Colombia, one was from the
United States. The rest of the participants were primarily
from the Lima metropolitan area.
Self-Reported Informatics Background and Skills
The baseline self-reported skills survey found that the
Medical Informatics group had less skill in speaking English and in using PubMed/MEDLINE. The Bioinformatics
group had higher scores in reading English, speaking English, computer skills, and using PubMed/MEDLINE. Overall, 65% self-reported very good proficiency in use of
computers, which was helpful for a fuller understanding
of this course.
Knowledge Gains
Eighteen of 20 in the Medical Informatics track and 21 out
of 23 in the Bioinformatics track completed both the preand post test. Results of performance for 39 health professionals on the test administered at the beginning and
close of the course is summarized in Table 1.

The BIO group showed a greater improvement in overall
score. Participants' performance on the knowledge test
improved from pre- to post-testing from 33.6% to 51.2%
for the BIO group and from 49.7% to 59.7% in the MI
group. Individual t-tests of these gains for the two tracks
were significant, P < 0.05 in both tracks.

The MI group had an increase in test scores for every one
of the five subject areas, while the BIO group had an
increase in three out of four subject areas (Drug Design
did not show an increase).
The size of the effect (Cohen's d) on knowledge gains indicated that participant's knowledge in the BIO group had a
large effect size and the MI group had a medium effect
size.
Attitudes
Daily
A total of 96 daily evaluations were completed over the
five days of classroom sessions, with 515 written comments registered. Thirty-two topics were covered in the
week-long course, 24 of them had ratings between 4 and
4.99, and eight had ratings of 5 or above, showing that the
courses had an average rating of good or better. Of the
written comments, 391 (76%) were clearly positive with
the other 124 (24%) being either negative or with both
negative and positive feedback included in the one comment.
End of Course
The end-of-course evaluation on the last day included
four rating questions using the Likert scale and four openended questions. Of the participants, 18 out of 20 in the
Medical Informatics track and 22 out of 23 in the Bioinformatics track completed the evaluation. Results are
shown in Table 2 for both tracks.

The main perceived strength of the course was the quality
of the speakers and the state-of-the-art technology used to
present information. The comments were overwhelmingly positive. Said one participant: "It's the best course I
have attended to up to this date. Informatics is a science
applied to several fields, such as Medicine and Biology,
and many people (professionals) don't use it due to a lack
of knowledge, but my congratulations to UPCH, which is
always ahead."
Students enjoyed the novel technology resources used,
such as the interactive audience response system (which
provided immediate feedback) and the teleconference ses-

sions. This was cited also as one of the perceived strengths
of the course.
The main perceived weakness was the short duration of
the course. People wanted more time to interact with their
peers. Some of the attendees did not know each other.
They wanted more opportunities to interact with informatics technological tools.
Having the joint sessions caused a mixed reaction, generally positive. Among the medical informatics group, only
half of the 17 respondents thought that it was an excellent
or interesting approach. Said one participant: "It allows
having a wider vision of informatics in general." But most
people (13 out of 18 respondents) in the bioinformatics
group thought that it was a great idea. Said one respondent: "I am a biologist and I did not know that they also
used informatics in medicine, and now I know another
very important aspect. I learned the value of arranging my
data with informatics tools."
Follow-up Evaluation Results
Of the 43 participants 29 (67%) responded to the sixmonth follow-up survey. Of those, 23 (79%) were actively
involved in health informatics or bioinformatics-related
activities (i.e., project, teaching, etc.) at the time they completed the survey. Of those who responded, 24 (83%)
thought that the course had changed their vision of what
health informatics is. For example, 18 (75%) perceived
that the course increased their knowledge in informatics,
and 5 (21%) perceived that the course provided participants more informatics skills. Examples were: "The course
expanded my horizons and showed clearly the advantages
of the use of informatics and telemedicine"; "After the
course, I started using bioinformatics tools to compare
genomes and bacterial DNA sequences"; "I had a more
clear and objective vision on how informatics could be
applied in public health such as patient monitoring, data-

All the respondents to the follow-up survey rated the usefulness of the course (scale range: 1 = poor – 5 = excellent)
as "good," "very good," or "excellent." There was not a statistically significant difference between the mean (SD) of
the end-of-the-course evaluation (3.9, 0.65) and the mean
(SD) of the six-month follow-up evaluation (3.8, 0.63).
This is a positive result in that there was no significant
decline over time.
Twenty (69%) respondents to the follow-up survey
expressed their willingness to participate in a health-informatics diploma offered by UPCH.

Discussion
Overall, the course was described by the participants as a
positive experience. These comments came from the daily
evaluations, and by the individual written comments at
the end of the course. Knowledge increased during this
course based on the pre- and post-test scores. Gains in
knowledge assessed immediately at the end of the course
indicated that this is an effective method of information
dissemination. The National Institute of Education has
issued guidelines asserting that gains as small as 0.33
standard deviation units are indicative of an educationally
significant effect [26]. Gains from pre-test knowledge
exceed this criterion for the BIO and MI groups, although
the BIO group had a larger effect size than the MI group.
These results support the hypothesis that these types of
courses can be very effective vehicles for translating and
transferring current informatics knowledge to health professionals. However, longer-term retention of these
knowledge gains were not assessed, which is a limitation
of this study. This increase of knowledge is consistent with
the success of other short informatics courses in Peru
[18,27]. For example, in the course held in 2000 out of 31
questions, the mean % score increased from 53 pre-test to
71 for the post-test. In 2000, the overall acceptance of the
course was very good to excellent with a rating of 4.2
(scale 1–5), and the usefulness of the course was rated as
very good.
The Bioinformatics track added for the first time to a
health informatics course in Peru, was well-received and
showed an increase in knowledge among the participants.
With the addition of the new track, a new strategy was also
introduced. Instead of a two-week course (as the previous
two courses), the course was one intensive week with two
tracks running simultaneously, mainly because health
professionals reported little time for training. This
brought mixed reactions and was the leading negative

BMC Medical Education 2008, 8:1

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6920/8/1

comment in the end-course evaluation. The length of the
course needs to be examined more thoroughly in further
courses. The American College of Medical Informatics
Task Force takes no formal position on optimal length of
training for health professionals interested in informatics
[28]. The debate is still going on in the education working
group in Medical informatics within the American Medical Informatics Association [29], the International Medical Informatics Association [30], and the European
Federation for Medical Informatics [31]. Special debate is
going on concerning the role and importance of bioinformatics, as one generally important part in the field of
health informatics.

The predominantly positive scores from the daily evaluations indicate satisfaction among participants with both
with the sessions and the speakers. This satisfaction with
the speakers is further supported by the fact that having
good speakers was the most often mentioned strength of
the course. It was beneficial to include speakers from both
Peruvian and non-national institutions to give greater
expertise and diversity to the course. It was the first time
that a mini-symposium was included with former Peruvian scholars trained in health informatics at the University of Washington. This symposium gave the scholars an
opportunity to present their work and network for potential research collaborations [33]

Training programs come in many shapes and sizes, and
trainees have a wide range of needs. Informatics training
for health professionals is a process. Serious training in
biomedical informatics, irrespective of application
domain, typically requires focused and extended study. It
is not possible to become a medical or health informatician, in any sense of the word, through attendance of a lecture series or participation in a series of workshops [28].

The interactive response system popular with participants
has been successfully used in other settings such as in a
group of medical students at the University of Washington too [34].

The results of the scores from both tracks indicates a lower
post-test score than the last informatics course (2001)
[27]. This issue could be due to several factors:
1) The complexity of the new topics introduced. The concepts may have been too difficult for participants or not
presented clearly.
2) The short duration of the course not allowing enough
time to absorb the new information.
3) The level of difficulty of the test. The test may have been
too advanced for these participants. Three of these five
questions came from the drug design subject area, a subject that should be readdressed.
4) It is possible that some of the questions required more
knowledge than was able to be covered in the sessions.
Through observation and informal interviews, there did
not seem to be adequate time to complete the Bioinformatics test, but this could also be due to the difficulty level
as well.
5) Some participants missed sessions, and there was confusion over the translation in both the tests and the sessions. These factors were also mentioned as potential
limitations in the 2000 Health Informatics Course [18].
6) Information overload – too much information over a
short period of time leading to poor test performance
[32].

The leading weakness cited by participants was the short
length of the course. Other related weaknesses mentioned
included not enough practice time and too much information (only for BIO). These weaknesses could be
improved for the next courses if a longer course is planned
for a slower acquisition of skills, and more "hands-on"
time is given to practice these skills.
The course was both celebrated for its diversity of topics,
yet criticized for some lectures not being appropriate. This
result is not surprising when bringing together professionals from a diversity of backgrounds and experiences so
that not everyone will be completely satisfied with the
content of every session. Nevertheless, the opinions of the
joint sessions were on the whole quite positive. Of interest, there was a higher percentage of MI participants that
had negative comments concerning the joint sessions
than the BIO participants. One possible explanation is
that the general informatics related content in the MI part
of the course was more general and thus useful to the BIO
participants, while the BIO content may have been more
specific and perhaps too detailed for the MI participants
The six-month follow-up survey found that the majority
of people were actively involved in health informatics or
bioinformatics-related activities (i.e., project, teaching,
etc.) at the time they completed the survey. In addition,
the majority of respondents thought that the course had
changed their vision of what health informatics is, and
have used what they learned after the course. Some people
found new informatics-related jobs after the course. Said
one participant: "This course changed my viewpoint and
gave me the confidence to search for a job in informatics.
Right now, I am a program manager developing a software
program targeted to unify health services for people living
with HIV/AIDS." After six-months, respondents main-

tained their perception on rating the usefulness of the
course as very good.
Course strengths
The present course had several strengths:

1) Promotion of interactions and collaborations between
speakers and participants to develop potential topics for
future research projects.

ticipated in the data analysis and helped draft the
manuscript. FMW made substantial contributions to the
data analysis and interpretation of data. ACL, PJG, MZ, SF,
AMK and KKH participated in planning the course,
reviewed the manuscript and made significant comments.
All authors read and approved the final manuscript.

3) Generation of interest of bioinformaticians in medical/
public health research and vice versa.
Course limitations
The sample of the participants for the course was non-representative since selection was limited both by class size
and by how participants learned about the course. The participants consisted mainly of adult Peruvian professionals
interested in health informatics and bioinformatics.

Conclusion
This course can be seen as a success based on significant
improvements in pre- to post-course test scores, and the
positive evaluations by the participants in both tracks. The
predominantly positive comments also indicate that the
new addition of the bioinformatics content, along with
the joint lectures involving both tracks, was a success. The
quality of speakers, noted to be the main strength, could
be attributed to the use of speakers from multiple institutions.
The appropriate length for the course to avoid information overload still needs further definition. Also, more
examination of the course design needs to occur to ensure
that the topics and content are specific to the participants'
interests and appropriate for the resources available.

Based upon evaluations of two previous courses on medical informatics and this combined course, we are developing a certificate program on health informatics at
UPCH, recognizing the need for inter-institutional collaboration with well-established health informatics training
programs. It is hoped that collaborations can be further
extended to neighboring countries in the future.
