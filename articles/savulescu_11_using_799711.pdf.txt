Abstract
Background: Physicians of the Spanish Influenza Sentinel Surveillance System report and systematically swab
patients attended to their practices for influenza-like illness (ILI). Within the surveillance system, some Spanish
regions also participated in an observational study aiming at estimating influenza vaccine effectiveness (cycEVA
study). During the season 2009-2010, we estimated pandemic influenza vaccine effectiveness using both the
influenza surveillance data and the cycEVA study.
Methods: We conducted two case-control studies using the test-negative design, between weeks 48/2009 and 8/
2010 of the pandemic season. The surveillance-based study included all swabbed patients in the sentinel
surveillance system. The cycEVA study included swabbed patients from seven Spanish regions. Cases were
laboratory-confirmed pandemic influenza A(H1N1)2009. Controls were ILI patients testing negative for any type of
influenza. Variables collected in both studies included demographic data, vaccination status, laboratory results,
chronic conditions, and pregnancy. Additionally, cycEVA questionnaire collected data on previous influenza
vaccination, smoking, functional status, hospitalisations, visits to the general practitioners, and obesity. We used
logistic regression to calculate adjusted odds ratios (OR), computing pandemic influenza vaccine effectiveness as
(1-OR)*100.
Results: We included 331 cases and 995 controls in the surveillance-based study and 85 cases and 351 controls in
the cycEVA study. We detected nine (2.7%) and two (2.4%) vaccine failures in the surveillance-based and cycEVA
studies, respectively. Adjusting for variables collected in surveillance database and swabbing month, pandemic
influenza vaccine effectiveness was 62% (95% confidence interval (CI): -5; 87). The cycEVA vaccine effectiveness was
64% (95%CI: -225; 96) when adjusting for common variables with the surveillance system and 75% (95%CI: -293; 98)
adjusting for all variables collected.
Conclusion: Point estimates of the pandemic influenza vaccine effectiveness suggested a protective effect of the
pandemic vaccine against laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H1N1)2009 in the season 2009-2010. Both studies were
limited by the low vaccine coverage and the late start of the vaccination campaign. Routine influenza surveillance
provides reliable estimates and could be used for influenza vaccine effectiveness studies in future seasons taken
into account the surveillance system limitations.

Background
In April 2009, Spain reported the first case of pandemic
influenza A(H1N1)2009 infection in Europe [1] and
since then the pandemic virus activity was monitored by
the Spanish Influenza Sentinel Surveillance System
(SISSS). The system has been in place since 1996 [2] to
provide timely epidemiological and virological information on influenza activity in Spain [3] also participating
in the European Influenza Surveillance Network [4]. To
better monitor the pandemic influenza, the 17 Spanish
regional sentinel networks integrated in the surveillance
system increased the number of sentinel general practitioners and paediatricians participating in influenza surveillance and introduced systematic swabbing of
patients.
Annually, in Spain, seasonal influenza vaccination is
recommended to high risk groups for influenza complications: patients with chronic conditions over six month
old, health care workers, and the elderly [5]. The seasonal
influenza vaccine 2008-2009 showed no effect in preventing the pandemic influenza A(H1N1)2009 infection [6].
However, the routine vaccination campaign was conducted between September and November 2009 using a
seasonal vaccine [7] similar to the 2008-2009 one.
The pandemic vaccination campaign started on 16
November 2009 (week 46/2009) and continued over the
season using the World Health Organization recommended pandemic monovalent vaccine based on A/California/7/09-like virus [8]. The vaccine was recommended
for health professionals, essential services, any person
over six month old with chronic conditions (heart diseases, pulmonary diseases (including asthma), renal, liver,
metabolic, neuromuscular, and immune diseases), morbidly obese, pregnant women, and close contacts of high
risk groups [9]. Various vaccine brands were used, mainly
adjuvanted in most of the risk groups and non-adjuvanted in pregnant women and children.
Since the season 2008-2009, Spain has been participating in the European Centre for Disease Prevention and
Control (ECDC) funded project “Influenza-Monitoring
of Vaccine Effectiveness” (I-MOVE) [10], aimed at identifying the best method to estimate influenza vaccine
effectiveness in the European Union (EU). As part of
the I-MOVE project, different designs were piloted
among elderly population, to identify the best approach
to estimate influenza vaccine effectiveness in Spain
(cycEVA study). The test negative design comparing the
vaccination status of the laboratory confirmed cases to
that of patients testing negative for influenza was considered feasible and adequate for Spain, in the context
of a pandemic [11].
The routine surveillance system has been previously
used [12-14] to estimate the effectiveness of seasonal
vaccine against the circulating influenza strain, using the

Page 2 of 9

test-negative design. It was considered that when suffering an episode of influenza like illness (ILI), the test
negative controls consult sentinel physicians in the same
way as the influenza laboratory confirmed cases, reducing the bias related to health seeking behaviour [15,16].
We aimed to estimate the pandemic influenza vaccine
effectiveness (PIVE) against laboratory confirmed pandemic influenza A(H1N1)2009 infection using both the
surveillance dataset and the cycEVA study, in order to
explore the capacity of surveillance system to provide
annually estimates of influenza vaccine effectiveness in
Spain.

Methods
Using the case-control test-negative design during the
influenza season 2009-2010, we analysed the influenza
surveillance data (surveillance-based study) and we conducted an observational study (cycEVA) embedded in
the surveillance system, collecting more information in a
better controlled way. We describe the two studies
below.
Surveillance-based study

A total of 647 general practitioners and 220 paediatricians from 17 out of 19 Spanish regions participated in
the influenza sentinel surveillance system during the
2009-2010 season, covering 2.6% of the Spanish population. Sentinel physicians systematically swabbed the first
two patients presenting with ILI each week. A case definition based on the EU ILI definition [17] was recommended for patient swabbing as follows: sudden onset
of symptoms, and at least one systemic symptom (fever
or feverishness, malaise, headache, myalgia), and at least
one respiratory symptom (cough, sore throat, shortness
of breath), and in the absence of other suspected clinical
diagnoses.
In the vaccine effectiveness study, we included all
patients with available laboratory results and vaccination
status recorded in the surveillance system during the
study period. Cases were patients laboratory confirmed
for pandemic influenza A(H1N1)2009 virus. Controls
were patients testing negative for any influenza virus
(test-negative controls).
Variables collected for surveillance purpose included:
age, sex, clinical symptoms, date of symptom onset, date
of swabbing, vaccination status for both pandemic and
seasonal vaccines, and laboratory data (confirmation,
influenza type/subtype, strain). For the first time, surveillance data also included information on clinical symptoms, chronic conditions and pregnancy. Patients were
defined as having at least one chronic disease if they suffered from one of the following conditions: diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, chronic pulmonary
diseases, and congenital or acquired immunodeficiency.

Savulescu et al. BMC Public Health 2011, 11:899
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/11/899

Vaccination status (pandemic and seasonal) was collected
as a dichotomous variable (yes/no). Data were reported
weekly by each sentinel physician to the Spanish region
epidemiology unit and included into a web-based application (http://vgripe.isciii.es/gripe).
cycEVA study

Seven out 17 Spanish regions participated in this study.
We invited all 304 sentinel physicians from these
regions and 235 (77%) agreed to participate. The population covered by these sentinel physicians represented
2.0% of the total population of the seven Spanish
regions.
The 235 study sentinel physicians also participated in
the influenza surveillance system and systematically
swabbed patients throughout the study period. The definition of cases and controls was the same as in the surveillance-based study. Thus, cases and controls of
cycEVA study were also included in the surveillancebased study.
Using a standardised questionnaire, the participating
physicians collected in addition to surveillance data (see
above) the following variables: date of vaccination, influenza vaccination in the two previous seasons, smoking,
functional status, obesity, hospitalisations for chronic
conditions, and outpatient visits in the previous 12
months. “Any chronic condition” variable was defined
the same as in the surveillance-based study. We defined
obesity (body mass index over 30) and pregnancy as risk
factors for pandemic influenza. The low functional status was defined as need of help for bathing or walking.
A patient was considered vaccinated if he/she had
received the pandemic influenza vaccine 14 days or
more before the date of symptom onset. Vaccination
status was verified against the vaccination registry and/
or the patient clinical history available at sentinel physicians’ offices.
We excluded from the cycEVA study: patients who
refused to participate; those not eligible for influenza
vaccination because they suffered from a condition listed
in the summary of product characteristics; institutionalised patients; those unable to give informed consent or
having received antiviral treatment at the moment of
swabbing.
In both studies, we included in the analysis all
swabbed patients with less than eight day delay between
symptom onset and swabbing and who were attended
by sentinel physicians two weeks after the start of the
pandemic vaccination campaign (week 48/2009) up to
week 8/2010 when the last confirmed influenza A
(H1N1)2009 case was reported to cycEVA study. In a
subsequent stage, we restricted the analysis to patients
meeting the EU ILI case definition. We also estimated
the pandemic vaccine effectiveness restricting the

Page 3 of 9

analysis to patients with less than four day delay
between the symptom onset and swabbing to avoid misclassification due to period of viral shedding.
We calculated the crude and adjusted odds ratios
(OR) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals
(95% CI) using logistic regression. We included in the
logistic regression models all variables available and
known from the literature to influence the influenza
vaccine effectiveness estimates as well as the month of
swabbing. Thus, the model for the surveillance-based
study included: age group, sex, seasonal vaccination,
chronic conditions, pregnancy, and month of swabbing.
In the cycEVA study, we first adjusted for the variables
common to both studies and then we included the additional covariates collected as well as the month of swabbing (full model). We computed PIVE as (1-OR)*100.
STATA/IC 10 was used for all statistical analyses (Stata
Statistical Software: Release 10. StataCorp LP, TX, USA).
The network-affiliated laboratories or the National
Centre of Microbiology (WHO National Influenza Centre) confirmed influenza cases using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or culture on Madin-Darby
canine kidney (MDCK) cell lines. For a proportion of
laboratory confirmed cases amplified products were
sequenced at the National Centre of Microbiology. Phylogenetic analysis was done to identify the influenza A
(H1N1)2009 virus.
Both studies were carried out in the frame of the
existing Spanish Influenza Sentinel Surveillance System
at the National Centre of Epidemiology; no ethical
approval is required for surveillance activities in Spain.
However, no personal data were collected and patients
gave verbal consent to be swabbed. The cycEVA study
was carried out following a generic protocol developed
for ECDC [18] and adapted for Spain by the National
Centre of Epidemiology.

Results
In Spain, the pandemic influenza activity exceeded the
baseline level in the week 40/2009 reaching the peak in
the week 46/2009 (372 ILI cases/100,000 inhabitants)
(Figure 1). The epidemic period lasted for 11 weeks,
from week 40/2009 to week 50/2009. The highest incidence was recorded in the age group 5-14 years old
(cumulative incidence: 7507 ILI cases/100,000 inhabitants). The maximum influenza weekly incidence in this
age group was 1104 ILI cases/100,000 inhabitants in the
epidemic peak.
Surveillance-based study

From week 48/2009 to week 8/2010, sentinel physicians notified 4580 ILI cases of which 1909 (42%) were
swabbed. After excluding patients with no laboratory
results (160 records), those with influenza type B or C

(six records), subtype H3N2 (two records) or unavailable subtype (seven records), 425 pandemic influenza
A(H1N1)2009 cases were recorded. The pandemic vaccination status was available for 1413 (74%) patients.
We included in the analysis the 1326 patients swabbed
less than eight days after the symptom onset: 331
influenza A(H1N1)2009 cases and 995 test-negative
controls. The number of recruited pandemic influenza
cases decreased by week of swabbing during the study
period (Figure 1). Cases and test-negative controls did
not differ by patient characteristics available in the surveillance system, except for clinical symptoms. Cases
were more likely to present with sudden onset, fever,
malaise, headache, cough and sore throat than controls. Nine cases (2.7%) and 41 controls (4.1%) were
vaccinated with the monovalent pandemic vaccine
(Table 1).
The crude pandemic influenza vaccine effectiveness
was 35% (95% CI: -38; 73) and the adjusted value was
62% (95% CI: -5; 87). We obtained similar results in the
analysis restricted to patients with a delay symptom
onset-swabbing less than four days (Table 2). The
adjusted point estimates using patients complying with
the EU ILI case definition was 41% (95% CI: -95; 82).
When we additionally restricted the analysis to ILI
patients swabbed in less than four days since the symptom onset, adjusted PIVE was 48% (95% CI: -110; 82)
(Table 2).

cycEVA study

A total of 440 ILI patients were recruited between week
48/2009 and week 8/2010. After excluding cases confirmed for other influenza viruses (one case type B),
those with a delay between symptom onset and swabbing of more than seven days (three records), we
included in the analysis 436 ILI cases: 85 influenza A
(H1N1)2009 cases and 351 test-negative controls. The
number of recruited patients decreased during the study
period (Figure 2). Most of the patients (62%) were
recruited towards the end of the epidemic period (week
48-50/2009). Cases and test-negative controls were similar for most variables included in the study. Among
cases, 92.7% presented cough compared to 80.7% controls (Table 3).
We identified two (2.4%) cases and 19 (5.4%) controls
vaccinated with the monovalent pandemic vaccine. The
crude PIVE was 58% (95% CI:-81; 95) and that adjusted
for all covariates was 75% (95% CI:-293; 98). The PIVE
adjusted for the covariates available in surveillance system was 65% (95%CI: -221; 96). We obtained similar
results in the analysis restricted to patients with a delay
between symptom onset and swabbing less than four
days (Table 2). Using the cases that complied with the
EU ILI case definition, the adjusted PIVE for all covariates was 71% (95%CI: -402; 98) and 59% (95%CI: -300;
96) when adjusting for the covariates common to both
studies. PIVE estimates in the restricted analysis to a

characterisation and 55 (81%) presented sufficient
genetic material for the test to be performed. Sequence
analysis of the product of amplification (948 nucleotides
of the HA1 fragment of the hemagglutinin gene) showed
that all the pandemic influenza A strains studied were
similar to the vaccine strain A/California/07/2009.

Discussion
Our results showed a possible protective effect of the
pandemic vaccine against medically attended laboratory
confirmed pandemic influenza A(H1N1)2009 in Spain,
in the context of low vaccination coverage and low ILI
incidence at the end of the epidemic period when the
study was carried out. However, these results are consistent with the good matching between the vaccine and
circulating strains.
Only a few vaccine failures were recorded in both studies. Pandemic vaccination started during the epidemic
peak in the week 46/2009, leaving only a short period of
time to enable vaccine effectiveness studies (after week
48/2009). In addition, the vaccination coverage was
lower than expected, reaching 16% in the target groups
for vaccination at the national level [19]. The pandemic
vaccination coverage in the sentinel physicians’ catchment area of the seven participating networks was
10.7%. This made difficult to estimate with precision the
PIVE in both studies.
We adjusted for most of the confounders described in
the literature in the cycEVA study and for available confounders in the surveillance-based study. The covariates
that mainly influenced the results (more than 5% difference between the crude and Mantel-Haenszel adjusted
OR) were: chronic conditions and seasonal vaccination
2009-2010 for the surveillance-based study and age, sex,
chronic conditions, month of swabbing, functional status, at least one hospitalisation in the previous 12

months, and GP visits in the previous 12 months for the
cycEVA study (data not shown). cycEVA PIVE estimates
using the full model were around 10% higher than the
PIVE adjusted only for the variables collected in surveillance system. When adjusting for the common variables
in the surveillance-based and cycEVA studies, the PIVE
point estimates were similar for all patients. Restricting
the analysis to a delay symptom onset -swabbing less
than four days or to patients meeting EU case definition,
the PIVE was around 10-20% higher in the cycEVA
study, probably reflecting the better data collection in

Savulescu et al. BMC Public Health 2011, 11:899
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/11/899

this study. Nevertheless, the point estimates in both studies are lower than those reported by other authors
[20-24]. The differences may be related either to the different outcomes and study designs or to the different
confounding factors adjusted for. A European multicentre study (I-MOVE) in which Spain participated with
data from the cycEVA study confirmed the cycEVA estimates by pooling data from seven countries [25].
The results of both studies suggest the presence of
negative confounding [26], because the adjusted point
estimates were higher than the crude ones. When we
measured the effectiveness of the seasonal vaccine during the previous influenza season [6,11], the adjusted VE
estimates were lower than the crude VE, suggesting the
predominance of positive confounding. Because the
Spanish population consults GPs more often than the
EU average (outpatient contacts/person/year 9.5 in 2003
in Spain and 7.67 in the EU) [27], we believe this
increases the probability that more elderly people with
better functional status are attended by the sentinel physicians (healthy vaccinee effect). This was not the case
during the 2009-2010 season. The observed negative
confounding might be related to the dynamics of the
influenza activity and/or to different health seeking
behaviour during the pandemic in Spain. Further studies
are needed in the future influenza seasons to better
understand these findings.
Among the limitations of the surveillance-based study,
we should also mention the lack of collecting of the
pandemic vaccination date. Unlike the usual influenza
seasons when the vaccination campaign complete before
the epidemic period, the pandemic vaccination started
and was carried out during the pandemic wave. In this
context, determining the delay between vaccination and
symptom onset became of crucial importance because
some individuals classified as vaccinated may not have
been protected, resulting in an underestimation of the
vaccine effectiveness. However, 80% of pandemic vaccinations were performed in the first two weeks of the
campaign [source: Ministry of Health and Social Policies, Spain, unpublished data]. Restricting the study period to two weeks after the start of the vaccination
campaign might have reduced this misclassification in
the surveillance-based study.
As it was impossible to distinguish the cycEVA
patients in the surveillance database, we were not able
to compare cycEVA patients to the rest of the surveillance system. However, subtracting the Spanish regions
participating in cycEVA from the total number of
patients included in the surveillance study, the crude
OR was 0.83 (95%CI: 0.29; 2.04), resulting in a crude
pandemic vaccine effectiveness of 17%. This might be
related to a lower compliance to the EU ILI case definition in the rest of the surveillance system compared to

cycEVA or to a higher weighting given to the clinical
judgement during the pandemic season due to the additional statement “in the absence of other suspected clinical diagnoses” added to EU ILI case definition. In fact,
sentinel physicians participating in the cycEVA study
used the mentioned EU ILI case definition since the season 2008-2009, meanwhile the rest of surveillance system adopted it for the pandemic 2009-2010 season. This
was only revealed collecting the clinical symptoms in
the surveillance system which allowed estimating the
compliance with the EU ILI case definition. We also
found that more than 40% of influenza laboratory confirmed cases notified to the surveillance system did not
meet the EU ILI case definition (low sensitivity), suggesting that the clinical judgement of the sentinel physicians might be useful for the recruitment of true
positive cases. These findings underline the need for
further studies related to EU ILI case definition.
The well established influenza sentinel surveillance
system in Spain rapidly adapted to monitor pandemic
influenza and allowed studying different aspects of its
activity, including vaccine effectiveness. Data were
weekly notified and analysed at regional and central
level. Several improvements were implemented in the
surveillance system for the pandemic season: data collection was expanded to include clinical symptoms,
chronic conditions and pregnancy; systematic swabbing
was introduced. On the other hand, cycEVA study presented an added value for the surveillance system.
Firstly, additional information was collected on confounding factors known from the literature to influence
influenza vaccine effectiveness estimates. Secondly, collecting the date of vaccination allowed avoiding misclassification of those vaccinated but not protected, which
proved to be essential during the pandemic season. Last
but not least, the data collection in the cycEVA study
was more complete and periodically validated.

Conclusions
The sentinel influenza surveillance system in Spain
allowed estimating the pandemic influenza vaccine effectiveness during a season with a high sentinel physicians’
workload. The results of both studies suggested a possible protective effect of the vaccine against laboratory
confirmed influenza A(H1N1)2009 infection, higher
when vaccination date is collected and some important
confounding factors are taking into account. This suggests that the routine influenza surveillance system provides reliable estimates and could be used for influenza
vaccine effectiveness estimates, if the data collection is
improved by taking into account the date of vaccination
and some additional potential confounding factors.
The pandemic season 2009-2010 represented a challenge for vaccine effectiveness studies due to the

Savulescu et al. BMC Public Health 2011, 11:899
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/11/899

availability of the vaccine after the pandemic peak and
the low pandemic influenza vaccination coverage.
Repeating both studies in future seasons and using
cycEVA study as a validation subset of the whole surveillance system will provide further information to
draw conclusions on the effectiveness of the influenza
vaccination in Spain.
