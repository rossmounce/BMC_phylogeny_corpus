Abstract
Background: Streptomycin (SM) is a broad spectrum antibiotic and is an important component of any antituberculosis therapy regimen. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the emergence of resistance but
still our knowledge is inadequate. Proteins form a very complex network and drugs are countered by their
modification/efflux or over expression/modification of targets. As proteins manifest most of the biological
processes, these are attractive targets for developing drugs, immunodiagnostics or therapeutics. The aim of present
study was to analyze and compare the protein profile of whole cell extracts from Mycobacterium tuberculosis
clinical isolates susceptible and resistant to SM.
Results: Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight
(MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry was employed for analyzing the protein profiles. Homology and in silico
characterization for identified proteins was assessed using BLAST, InterProScan and KEGG database searches.
Computational studies on the possible interactions between SM and identified proteins were carried out by a
battery of online servers and softwares, namely, CLUSTALW (KEGG), I-TASSER, VMD, PatchDock and FireDock. On
comparing 2DE patterns, nine proteins were found consistently overexpressed in SM resistant isolates and were
identified as Rv0350, Rv0440, Rv1240, Rv3075c, Rv2971, Rv3028c, Rv2145c, Rv2031c and Rv0569. In silico docking
analysis showed significant interactions of SM with essential (Rv0350, Rv0440 and Rv2971) and non essential
(Rv1240, Rv3075c and Rv2031c) genes.
Conclusions: The computational results suggest high protein binding affinity of SM and suggested many possible
interactions between identified proteins and the drug. Bioinformatic analysis proves attributive for analysis of
diversity of proteins identified by whole proteome analysis. In-depth study of the these proteins will give an insight
into probable sites of drug action other than established primary sites and hence may help in search of novel
chemotherapeutic agents at these new sites as inhibitors.

Background
Tuberculosis is one of the most challenging infectious
diseases. Globally, 9.2 million new cases and 1.7 million
deaths occur due to this disease [1]. Its impact on public
health is further aggravated by co-infection with human
immunodeficiency virus, emergence of multi-drug resistant strains and reactivation of the dormant bacteria.

Guerin (BCG) and other integral vaccines have generally
been disappointing though some subunit vaccines are
under trial [2]. The excessive emergence of drug resistant tuberculosis has stimulated interest in the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of drug
resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and significant
progress has been made in this field [3]. Streptomycin
(SM) is first line anti-tuberculosis drug and preferred
for treatment of relapses. It inhibits protein synthesis in
susceptible bacteria by interacting with steps of translation. Modification of the primary target of the drug by
mutations in the genes encoding either the 16 S rRNA

or S12 ribosomal proteins primarily affects the activity
of SM and is clinically significant in Mycobacterium species [4,5]. However, nearly one third of resistant isolates
of M. tuberculosis do not have these mutations suggesting the involvement of some other mechanism(s)
responsible for resistance [6-8]. Role of efflux pumps in
SM resistance have been demonstrated by inhibitor
assays [9]. Recently an acetyltransferase gene Rv0262c
[10] and mutation within gidB gene [11] have also been
reported to confer low level SM resistance in M. tuberculosis. Still there is a scope for unraveling more underlying mechanisms for SM resistance.
Two-dimension gel electrophoresis (2DE) along with
mass spectrometry is a powerful and direct tool to study
differential protein expression in cells. Identification and
characterization of mycobacterial proteins as drug targets, diagnostics and vaccine candidates have been popular research objectives, but comparative proteome
profiling of drug susceptible and resistant isolates
remain unexplored in relation to SM. Therefore, the
aim of the present study was to compare the protein
profiles of cell extracts from M. tuberculosis isolates sensitive and resistant to SM.

Results
This study was focused on the proteins overexpressed
in SM resistant M. tuberculosis clinical isolates. Protein
profiles were compared by 2DE run in triplicates for
each isolate. 2DE patterns for SM susceptible and SM
resistant isolates are shown as Additional File 1 and
Additional File 2 respectively. Spots appearing consistently overexpressed among resistant isolates were
further processed. We found nine protein spots to be

Page 2 of 11

overexpressed in SM resistant isolates in comparison
to sensitive isolates (Figure 1). Magnified regions of
these overexpressed proteins are shown in Figure 2.
These protein spots were further identified as DnaK,
60 kDa chaperonin2, Malate dehydrogenase, Probable
oxidoreductase, Electron transfer flavoprotein subunit
alpha, Antigen 84, 14 kDa antigen and two hypothetical proteins by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry
(Table 1) and identity also confirmed by MS/MS
(Table 2). The level of over expression has been represented as densitometric ratio in Table 1. All the spots
except one exhibited at least two fold over expression.
However, Antigen 84 overexpressed maximally more
than four fold.
Results of computational analysis of all nine overexpressed proteins using different softwares and servers
are as follows.
BLAST Analysis

Blastp analysis was carried out for two hypothetical
proteins and two proteins with unknown functions.
Hypothetical protein (Rv3075c) was found highly
conserved (99 ± 0.05% identical) in few species of mycobacteria and in others it acts as citrate lyase subunit
beta-like protein (CitE) or HpcH/HpaI aldolase. Other
one hypothetical protein (Rv0569) was also found highly
conserved in mycobacteria and other microbes and significant function could not be assigned except in few
microbes as signal-transduction protein (Frankia and
Nocardioides sps.) and DNA-binding protein (Streptomyces coelicolor &S. lividans). Probable oxidoreductase
(Rv2971) appeared highly conserved in some species of

Rv0440 showed 45% homology with human heat shock
60 kDa protein-1 and Rv1240 exhibited 48.93% homology with human malate dehydrogenase. Rv3075c had
20.19% homology with CitE of human, 86.31% with
M. marinum & 85.66% with M. ulcerans, Rv2971
revealed 34% homology with human aldo-keto reductase
and Rv3028c had 39% homology with human electron
transfer flavoprotein. Rv2145c had 18.34% homology
with ankyrin repeat domain 24 protein of human.
Rv2031c had 29.86% homology with HSP20/alpha crystallin family protein of M. avium and 20% homology
with 18 kDa antigen of M. leprae. However it showed
17% homology with human outer dense fiber of sperm
tails protein. The hypothetical protein (Rv0569) did not
show homology with any human protein.
InterProScan analysis

InterProScan analysis of Rv0350 showed nine signature
motifs [SPRINT: PR00301] (Figure 3a) and motifs 1, 5
and 6 were most conserved [INTERPRO: IPR018181].
One peptide binding domain [SUPERFAMILY:
SSF100920] and two actin like ATPas domains were also
present in it [SUPERFAMILY: SSF53067]. Rv0440 showed
five conserved motifs [SPRINT: PR00298], one conserved
site (from residues 403-414) for 60 kDa Chaperonin
[INTERPRO: IPR018370] (Figure 3b) and GroEL apical
domain like region from residues 182-374 [SUPERFAMILY: SSF52029]. Rv1240 revealed one characteristic motif
which provides a signature for L-lactate/malate dehydrogenase [PFAM: PF00056], one active site from residues
156-168 [PROSITE: PS00068] (Figure 3c) and NAD (P)binding Rossmann fold domains [SUPERFAMILY:
SSF51735]. Rv3075c showed characteristic HpcH-HpaI
motifs [PFAM: PF03328], phosphoenolpyruvate/pyruvate
domain from residues 22 to 239 [SUPERFAMILY:
SSF51621] and citrate lyase beta subunit domain from
residues 1-288 which provides a signature for lyase/aldolase activity [UNIPROT: PIRSF015582]. Rv2971 showed
five Aldo/keto reductase subgroups 43-67, 99-117, 131148, 165-194 and 202-226 [SPRINT: PR00069] out of
which one is conserved site of aldo/keto reductase from
residues 131-148 [PROSITE: PS00062] (Figure 3e).
Rv3028c showed alpha/beta-subunit motif from residues
4-125 [PFAM: PF01012], one alpha subunit from residues
197-227 [PFAM: PF00766] and one conserved site found
from residues 257-283 in alpha subunit at C-terminal side
[PROSITE: PS00696] (Figure 4a). Rv2145c showed divIVA
motif from residues 3-61 [PFAM: PF05103] and DivIVA
domain from residues 3-39 [CMR: TIGR03544] (Figure
4b). Rv2031c confirmed its relation with Hsp20/alpha
crystallin family [PFAM: PF00011], heat shock hsp20 proteins family profile [PROSITE: PS01031] and HSP20-like
chaperone [SUPERFAMILY: SSF49764]. Amino acid residues were almost common for showing its relation with

Page 5 of 11

all three families. Signature for chaperone proteins and
HSP20 family motif is also present in the same region
from residues 22-142 [PANTHER: PTHR11527]. Rv0569
showed domain of unknown function DUF1918 from residues 1-58 [PFAM: PF08940] (Figure 4c). None of the nine
proteins had signal peptide or transmembrane domains
neither they had any site for post translational
modifications.
3D modeling and docking

All selected 3D models showed less than 2% discrepancy
from Ramachandran plot. These models were further
explored for in silico docking studies to identify the
binding of SM. Parameters used for selection of 3D
models and their docking with SM are represented in
Table 3. There were possible active cavities observed on
the surface of the 3D structures. Molecular docking of
SM with secondary structures of Rv0350, Rv0440,
Rv1240 & Rv3075c proteins showed successful binding
(Figure 3) into the central cavity of the protein and the
drug molecule fits well in the cavity. However, with
Rv0350 and Rv3075c, drug showed binding at the conserved active site whereas in Rv1240, SM is interacting
with four residues of conserved active site and for
Rv0440 drug showed binding in the close vicinity of the
conserved site. In docked complex of Rv2971 and
Rv2031c, binding of drug was far from the conserved/
active site (Figure 3). Remaining three proteins Rv3028c,
Rv2145c & Rv0569 did not show significant binding of
the drug and their 3D models are shown in Figure 4.

Discussion
The 2DE profile of SM resistant M. tuberculosis clinical
isolates exhibited many proteins that were overexpressed. Protein spots 1 and 2 are chaperone protein 70
kDa DnaK (Rv0350) and 60 kDa Chaperonin-2/GroEL-2
(Rv0440) respectively. These essential genes prevent
misfolding and promote the refolding and proper assembly of unfolded/misfolded polypeptides generated under
stress conditions. Rv0350 have characteristic peptide
binding domain and ATPase domain, which indicate its
role in active protein refolding and proper assembly.
The most conserved motifs are interacting with docked
SM which indicates that the drug may inhibit/modulate
the functioning of this protein and might influence SM
toxicity. In prokaryotes DnaK is known to negatively
regulate/auto-regulate expression of many HSP proteins
by promoting degradation of s32 heat shock transcriptional regulator [12] and s32 regulates over expression
of other HSPs [13]. Thus blocking of DnaK activity not
only positively regulates its expression but may also
change HSP profile of the cell. Rv0350 has also been
found overexpressed in SM induced culture of SM
mono-resistant clinical isolate of M. tuberculosis [14].

Rv0440 (GroEL) is the second copy of 60 kDa Chaperonin in M.tuberculosis genome. This gene is situated
away from classic GroEL-Cpn10 operon and suggests a
specialised regulation in M.tuberculosis. SM showed
binding in the close vicinity of the conserved site on the
apical domain, which is a peptide binding domain [15]
and therefore it may be predicted that it could be a possible inhibitor/modulator. Duplicate copies of this gene
suggest its importance as an energy independent chaperonin in slow metabolism efficient genome of M.
tuberculosis [16]. Over expression of this gene could
be to compensate inhibited/modulated molecules or to
neutralise drug by binding. Further, spot 8 corresponding to Rv2031c encodes 14 kDa antigen (HSP16.3/
HSPX) which is a member of the small heat-shock
protein family of chaperones. It has been shown to be
induced under oxygen-deficient conditions [17]. Its
role in maintenance of long term viability during
latent, asymptomatic infections and in replication

Page 6 of 11

during initial infection has also been proposed. Docking studies revealed that the SM binds to a demarcated
cavity comprising of 10 amino acids though the interacting amino acids do not belong to any known activity region but these are highly conserved among
mycobacteria. These leads can be exploited for better
understanding of function of these domains by
employing inhibition studies.
Spot 3 (Rv1240) encodes malate dehydrogenase, which
is involved in the conversion of malate to oxaloacetate.
Role of this protein in M. tuberculosis drug resistance
remains to be elucidated. SM interacts with the amino
acids of conserved active site of Rv1240, which suggests
that the drug can affect the activity of this enzyme. Spot
5 (Rv2971) belonging to oxidoreductase of aldo/keto
reductase family is probably involved in cellular metabolism. Previous studies also found that this protein was
differentially expressed between BCG and H37Rv and
was regarded as a candidate antigen for development of

novel vaccine [18,19]. Furthermore, this protein has also
been reported to be differentially expressed between isoniazid (INH) susceptible and resistant strains [20]. Residues found interacting with SM were situated far from
conserved site and therefore it is suggested that this
protein might be playing a secondary role in imparting
resistance.
Spot 6 (Rv3028c) is an electron transfer flavoprotein
alpha subunit. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that
alpha subunit provides a signature for the electron
transfer flavoprotein family. The electron transfer flavoprotein serves as a specific electron acceptor for other
dehydrogenases. It transfers the electrons to the main
respiratory chain via ETF-ubiquinone oxidoreductase
(ETF dehydrogenase) [21] and participates in the oxidation of fatty acids [22]. The 3D structure of Rv3028c
adopts a typical bi-lobed structure with four alpha
helices each packing against the hydrophobic beta sheet
comprising of 5 plates in alpha subunit motif and 7
plates in beta subunit interacting motif. No significant
in silico interactions with SM were found. Further studies regarding substrate specificity & interacting proteins might reveal a relation with SM resistance. Spot 7
(Rv2145c) encodes antigen 84 and also corresponds to
wag31 which was originally identified as antigen of
pathogenic mycobacteria that is recognized by serum
from tuberculosis patients [23]. Studies indicate that this
gene is a homologue of the cell shape/cell division protein DivIVA and one of the substrates of PknA and
PknB [24]. Orthologs of Rv2145c have also been found
as immunogenic, cell division initiation protein or
secreted antigen Wag31 in some microbes. Rv3028c &
Rv2145c were also found overexpressed in INH resistant
M. tuberculosis isolates [20]. Its 3D structure showed
that the protein has a bi-lobbed ribbon structure

comprising mostly of alpha helices & the conserved site
of the protein had no evident interaction with SM.
Two protein spots 4 (Rv3075c) and 9 (Rv0569) which
encode hypothetical protein could not be assigned any
function. Phylogenetic analysis of these two proteins
revealed existence of their homologous sequences in
other mycobacterial species with known as well as
unknown functions and reflected dynamic and interesting scenarios of evolutionary importance. Rv3075c,
besides showing homology with hypothetical protein,
also showed homology with CitE of some mycobacterial species. While the bacterial citrate lyase is a
heterotrimeric complex with three subunits, the
M. tuberculosis genome does not contain a and g subunits of this complex, implying that M. tuberculosis
CitE act differently from other bacterial CitE proteins
[25]. These data hint that the biochemical function of
the M. tuberculosis and human CitE may differ from
other bacterial CitE proteins, and that M. tuberculosis
CitE may be critical for pathogenesis, encompassing
part of a novel pathway for fatty acid biosynthesis or
anaerobic energy metabolism [26].
SM docking with Rv3075c revealed that the drug
binds to the active site of the protein and interacts with
16 residues, out of which, one residue (162, Asp) has
been reported as a part of active site in E. coli [27,28].
Thus it is suggested that the SM is binding at the active
site of Rv3075c. It is assumed that the drug might interfere with protein function. blastp analysis of the other
hypothetical protein (Rv0569) did not show any significant identity (exhibited homology with hypothetical proteins). Phylogenetic and blastp analysis exhibited that
Rv0569 might work as signal transduction protein or
DNA binding protein but no function has been assigned.
3D model of this protein showed semi-lunar beta barrel

Conclusions
To conclude, this study has employed proteomic
approach, which is a direct method, to identify proteins
from resistant M. tuberculosis isolates compared to sensitive isolates. Nine protein spots were consistently overexpressed in SM resistant isolates. We expect that these
proteins might be contributing in conferring resistant
phenotype to the isolates. Further these proteins were
subjected to advanced bioinformatics analysis to generate an understanding of the subtle relation of SM with
the overexpressed proteins. Homology searches and
InterProScan generated insights to the possible functions and essential domains of the proteins. Rv0350,
Rv0440, Rv1240, Rv3075c, Rv2971 and Rv2031c showed
significant interaction in silico with SM thus their over
expression in the resistant isolates could be compensating the inhibited/modulated molecules. Other proteins
which are overexpressed but do not exhibit good binding with drug might be indirectly associated with SM.
The elucidated mechanisms and associations may be

Methods
Mycobacterial growth and drug susceptibility testing

Six SM resistant and three sensitive (to five first line
drugs) M. tuberculosis clinical isolates were obtained
from Mycobacterial Repository Centre of our Institute.
Susceptibility testing was performed by conventional LJ
proportion method [29]. Bacteria were grown in Sauton’s liquid medium at 37°C for four weeks (late log
phase).
Preparation of mycobacterial cell extract

Mycobacterial cell extract was prepared according to
modified protocol of Brodie et al., [30]. Cells were
washed three times with normal saline and then suspended in sonication buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl containing 10 mM MgCl 2 , 0.1% sodium azide, 1 mM PMSF
and 1 mM EGTA; pH 7.4) at a concentration of 1 g wet
cell mass per 5 ml and then broken by intermittent
sonication for 15 min at 4°C using sonicator (Sonics &
Materials Inc, Newtown, CT, USA). The homogenate
was centrifuged at 12,000 g for 20 min at 4°C. Pellets
were discarded and supernatant was stored at -70°C
until used.

Protein precipitation with SDS-TCA-acetone

In-gel digestion with trypsin

Cell extracts were treated with 1% SDS and then subjected to trichloro acetic acid (TCA)-acetone precipitation procedure [31]. 10% TCA was added to the cell
extract, the mixture was incubated at -20°C overnight
and then precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation (18,000 g, 4°C, 15 min). It was again washed
twice with 100% ice cold acetone and allowed to air dry.
The protein pellet was suspended in appropriate volume
of two-dimensional rehydration buffer (BIO-RAD, Hercules, CA, USA). Protein concentration was estimated
using the Bradford assay [32].

Method of Shevchenko et al., [36] was followed with
slight modifications as described earlier [34]. Protein
spots of interest were excised from gels using spot
picker ‘Investigator ProPic’ (Genomic Solutions,
Huntingdon, UK) and collected in 96 well PCR plate.
Digestion of proteins and spotting of peptides on
MALDI-TOF target plate was carried out using protein
digester ‘Investigator ProPrep’ (Genomic Solutions,
Huntingdon, UK). The gel plugs were destained and
dehydrated by washing three times (~10 min) with 25
mM NH4HCO3-50% acetonitrile (ACN) (1:1). Dried gel
plugs were treated with freshly prepared 10 mM DTT
in 50 mM NH4HCO3 for 45 min at 56°C. After incubation, the DTT was replaced quickly by the same volume
of freshly prepared 55 mM iodoacetamide in 50 mM
NH4HCO3 for 30 min and then dehydrated with 100%
ACN. The dried gel pieces were incubated for 12 h at
37°C with 25 mM NH4HCO3 containing 0.02 μg/μl of
mass spectrometry grade trypsin (Promega, Madison,
WI, USA). The resulting peptides were extracted twice
from the gel pieces, using peptide extraction buffer
(1:1 mixture of 70% ACN and 0.1% trifluoroacetic
acid [TFA]).

Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE)

Isoelectric focusing (IEF) was carried out using the
method of ‘in gel rehydration’ [33] with slight modifications as described previously [34]. Immobilized pH
gradient (IPG) strips of pH 4-7 and length 17 cm
(BIO-RAD, Hercules, CA, USA) were rehydrated overnight at 20°C with 500 μg protein which was mixed
with rehydration buffer. Strips were then focused on
an IEF unit PROTEAN IEF Cell (BIO-RAD, Hercules,
CA, USA) at 20°C using the following four step program: a) 0-250 V for 2 h in linear mode; b) 250 V
constant for 2 h in rapid mode; c) 250-5000 V for 4 h
in linear mode; and d) 5000 V constant until 35 kVh
reached. The current limit was set at 50 μA per strip.
After IEF, IPG strips were equilibrated for 15 min in
equilibration buffer I (6 M urea, 2% SDS, 0.375 M
Tris; pH 8.8, 20% glycerol) containing 130 mM
dithiothreitol (DTT) followed by equilibration buffer
II containing 135 mM iodoacetamide instead of DTT
for 15 min.
Proteins were separated in second dimension on 12%
SDS-PAGE [35] in a vertical electrophoretic dual gel
unit PROTEAN II XI (BIO-RAD, Hercules, CA, USA)
at constant voltage of 250 V for 5-6 h and gels were
stained with coomassie brilliant blue R250 to visualize
proteins. Images of gels were acquired by Chemidoc
(BIO-RAD, Segrate [Milan], Italy) using Quantity One
software (BIO-RAD, Hercules, CA, USA). 2 D gels
were analysed using PDQuest Advanced software (version 8.0) (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Images were
analysed using stepwise spot detection and spot matching followed by differential expression analysis.
PDQuest employs Student t-test and enumerates spots
with differential intensity of significant levels. Resultant
composite images for susceptible and resistant isolates
were manually checked for artifactual spots, merged
spots, and missed spots (Figure 1) and few spots with
more isolate specific variability were omitted in the
down stream processing. Equal amount of protein was
loaded in all gels and experiments were repeated at
least three times.

Mass spectrometry

Mass spectrometry was carried out as described earlier
[34]. Digested samples were desalted and concentrated
on C-18 ZipTips (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) using
the manufacturer’s protocol. ZipTips were eluted on
MTP 384 target plate with 2 μl of a-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (HCCA) (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) saturated
solution dissolved in 50% ACN, 0.2% TFA. Mass spectra
of digested proteins were acquired using Autoflex II
TOF/TOF 50 (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Leipzig,
Germany) in positive reflectron mode, in the detection
range of 500-3000 m/z. External calibration to a spectrum, acquired for a mixture of peptides with masses
ranging from 1046 to 2465 Da, was done prior to acquisition. The proteolytic masses obtained were then processed through Flex Analysis v.2.4 programme for peak
detection. Submission of peak lists to the UniProtKB/
Swiss-Prot database using the Mascot search engine
http://www.matrixscience.com to identify the proteins
from the annotated M. tuberculosis chromosome (strain
H37Rv, EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ entry AL123456) Release
20 (June 2010). The pI and molecular mass of proteins
were taken into account for identification of proteins
and we did not find any significant difference between
the experimental and predicted pI and molecular mass
of proteins. Peptide mass tolerance was set to 50 ppm
with carbamidomethyl-cystein set as fixed modification,
oxidation of methionine as variable modification and 1
missed cleavage site allowed. Few intense peaks from

each spectrum were selected for fragmentation by laserinduced dissociation in MALDI-TOF/TOF. The MS⁄MS
spectra were calibrated internally to the precursor ion
mass and used for sequence specific search at mascot
database (Matrix science). In addition, peptide mass fingerprint-based searches were carried out using only the
set of peptide masses, in the same database without any
constraints for isoelectric point (pI) and molecular mass.
The whole procedure was repeated several times to
ensure correct protein identification.
Bioinformatic analysis

Protein sequences of all nine overexpressed proteins were
retrieved from Tuberculist server http://genolist.pasteur.
fr/TubercuList/ hosted by Pasteur Institute, Paris for
whole annotated genome of H37Rv. BLAST [37] runs
were performed at NCBI server http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/ using the default threshold E-value of 10 and inclusion threshold value of 0.005. Motif and domain searches
were made on EBI server http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/
InterProScan/ employing InterProScan which uses 13
different homology search programs (blastprodom,
fprintscan, pfam, pir, panther, tigr, smart, superfamily,
gene3 d, scanregexp, profilescan, seg, coils, tm, signalp,
GO). Orthologs of proteins from other species of mycobacteria and human were obtained from KEGG http://
www.genome.jp/kegg/ by single-directional best-hit
option (SBH) and same server was employed for multiple
sequence alignments (CLUSTALW) [38] we have used
the following combined set of 5 organisms: mtu
(M. tuberculosis), mbo (M.bovis), mav (M.avium), mle
(M. leprae) and hsa (Homo sapiens). Sequences of H37Rv
were submitted for 3-dimentional structure predictions
at I-TASSER server http://zhang.bioinformatics.ku.edu/
I-TASSER/. Structures were selected on the basis of
RMSD values and agreement with Ramachandran Plot
using VMD software (University of Illinois). Selected
structures were molecularly docked with SM (structure
obtained from http://www.drugbank.ca for in-silico interactions studies by submitting the structures to Patch
Dock server [39] http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/PatchDock/
which is based on shape complementarity principles
and results were refined using FireDock server [40,41]
http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/FireDock/ which rearranges the
interface side chains and adjusts the relative orientation of
the molecules. Interacting amino acid side chains, drug
molecule orientation and docking feasibility was based on
Fire Dock scores and visualizations with VMD software.
