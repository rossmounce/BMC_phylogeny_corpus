Abstract
Background: Complete genome annotation will likely be achieved through a combination of
computer-based analysis of available genome sequences combined with direct experimental
characterization of expressed regions of individual genomes. We have utilized a comparative
genomics approach involving the sequencing of randomly selected hamster testis cDNAs to begin
to identify genes not previously annotated on the human, mouse, rat and Fugu (pufferfish) genomes.
Results: 735 distinct sequences were analyzed for their relatedness to known sequences in public
databases. Eight of these sequences were derived from previously unidentified genes and
expression of these genes in testis was confirmed by Northern blotting. The genomic locations of
each sequence were mapped in human, mouse, rat and pufferfish, where applicable, and the
structure of their cognate genes was derived using computer-based predictions, genomic
comparisons and analysis of uncharacterized cDNA sequences from human and macaque.
Conclusion: The use of a comparative genomics approach resulted in the identification of eight
cDNAs that correspond to previously uncharacterized genes in the human genome. The proteins
encoded by these genes included a new member of the kinesin superfamily, a SET/MYND-domain
protein, and six proteins for which no specific function could be predicted. Each gene was
expressed primarily in testis, suggesting that they may play roles in the development and/or
function of testicular cells.

Background
The initial publication of two draft versions of the human
genome led to intense debate over the exact number of
genes in the human genome [1,2]. Current estimates suggest that the human genome encodes approximately
35,000 to 38,000 although the final number must await
the complete annotation of each genome sequence. The
search for additional genes not discovered during early

annotation attempts has involved the use of several different approaches. These have included the sequencing of
randomly selected cDNAs from various tissue sources, the
development of computer-based prediction programs of
ever-increasing accuracy, and the direct comparison
between the human genome and the genome sequences
of other vertebrates and invertebrates [3–9]. Using these

approaches, fully annotated genomes of numerous species will be available within a relatively short time.

based molecular motors and a protein likely to be
involved in chromatin remodeling.

We approached the problem of gene identification by
using a combination of experimental and in silico techniques. Specifically, we initiated a project designed to
sequence expressed sequence tags from the hamster testis
and used these sequences to identify unannotated, or
incompletely annotated, genes in the human and other
vertebrate genomes. The hamster has not been used extensively in genomics research; however, it has been used
extensively in various areas of investigation including circadian rhythm research [10] and also in investigations in
a number of areas of research in reproductive biology. For
example, the study of hamster gametes has revealed significant information concerning the mechanisms underlying
species-specific sperm-egg interactions [11–13] and the
deleterious effects of endocrine disruptors on male and
female reproductive development [14–17]. The hamster,
mouse and rat are all members of the family Muridae,
however both mice and rats belong to the subfamily Murinae while hamsters belong to the subfamily Cricetinae.
Three hamster species that are commonly used in research
are Mesocricetus auratus (Syrian golden hamster), Cricetulus griseus (Chinese hamster) and Phodopus sungorus (Siberian hamster). Therefore, sequence information from any
hamster species should complement information gained
from other closely related species.

Results
Generation and sequence analysis of a Hamster testis
cDNA library
Random clones from a hamster testis cDNA library were
selected and sequenced as described in materials and
methods. The sequences were screened to remove ribosomal RNA and vector sequences, which yielded 735 distinct sequences. The sequence of each clone was
compared to sequences in public databases to identify its
closest match. Each sequence was then assigned to a functional group based on this comparison (Table 1). The
genes were distributed amongst all of the functional
groups listed with the highest numbers in groups associated with protein synthesis and degradation (11%),
metabolism (6%), gene regulation and RNA processing
(8%) and intracellular signaling (5%). Overall, the data
set contains examples of numerous testis-specific genes as
well as genes that display less limited patterns of
expression.

We next considered the overall complexity of the
sequences in our database as our cloning strategy made it
Table 1: Classification of sequenced hamster cDNAs

Classification

The testis was chosen for these studies as it represents a
viable source for the identification of novel genes. The
adult testis is a complex organ consisting of numerous different somatic cell types as well as germ cells at all stages
of spermatogenesis from the gonocyte stem cells to the
mature sperm cells [18]. Consequently, several unique
gene populations, including those involved in the regulation of meiosis, as well as those specific to the various testicular cell types, are expressed in the testis. A recent gene
discovery study performed in the testis of Drosophila melanogaster found that 47% of greater than 1500 sequenced
cDNAs did not match to ESTs previously identified in this
organism [19]. Likewise the testis of the cynomolgus
monkey has yielded several novel gene sequences [8,9].
Therefore, we reasoned that the sequencing of ESTs from
hamster testis might reveal the existence of novel genes
conserved in other species that may function in controlling testicular development and/or function. In this
report, we describe our initial results from the sequencing
of randomly-selected cDNAs from the testes of male Syrian golden hamsters. In particular we identified eight
cDNAs that appear to be derived from genes that were not
previously annotated in the human genome. We describe
the detailed analysis of two of these genes, which encode
a new member of the kinesin superfamily of microtubule-

Each of the hamster ESTs was compared against public sequence
databases using BLAST. Each clone was then functionally classified
based on the results of these searches. The number of unique fragments belonging to gene in each functional category is listed first, followed in parentheses by the total number of unique genes
represented once the occurrence of multiple fragments from the
same gene is accounted for.

possible to obtain multiple fragments from the same
cDNA. We identified only 40 instances where more than
one fragment was derived from the same gene (data not
shown). In addition, only 17 fragments appeared more
than two times in the database and only 6 fragments
appeared more than three times. The most common
sequences were derived from genes that are known to be
highly expressed in the testis in other organisms and
include heat shock protein 90A [20], chitobiase [21],
outer dense fiber of sperm tails [22] and kinectin [23].
Therefore, the majority of sequences were represented
only once or at most two times in the data set. The fact
that most sequences were not identified multiple times
suggests that we have not exhaustively sequenced all of
the DpnII fragments from cDNAs expressed in the hamster
testis. This is not surprising as conservative estimates suggest that there are many thousands of unique transcripts
expressed in the various somatic and germ cell lineages in
the testis.
The largest group of sequences identified in this project
falls into the functionally unclassified group (Table 1).
This group includes a small number of named genes for
which no function has yet been assigned but primarily
contains the results of full-length cDNA sequencing
projects or genes predicted by gene finding software.
Approximately one third of these clones (78 out of 239)
were originally isolated from testis libraries, suggesting
that a large number of genes remain to be functionally
characterized in the testis.
Identification of novel testis specific genes
200 sequences could not be sorted into the various functional groups described above and represented a potential
source of novel genes that had not previously been recognized by EST or genome sequencing. However, there were
several other possible origins for such sequences. These
included contamination of the original cDNA sample
with genomic DNA (note that the testis total RNA was
treated with DNase before mRNA purification) or artifactual joining of unrelated sequences into chimeric fragments that resulted in matches that were not detected in
our screen. As we synthesized cDNA from total RNA and
not cytoplasmic RNA, it was possible that some fragments
could be derived from RNAs that were incompletely processed [24]. Furthermore, these fragments could be derived
from alternatively spliced exons of known genes or from
genes that are only expressed in hamster. Therefore, several clones were selected for further examination based on
their sequence similarity to unannotated regions of the
human genome (see below) and for Northern analysis
using hamster RNAs prepared from various tissues. Eight
clones yielded specific signals in RNA from hamster testis
while two clones also detected signals in other tissues (figure 1). Subsequent analysis has revealed that each clone is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/4/22

derived form a bona fide gene and the evidence for this
conclusion is provided below for each gene (see Table 2).
The derived protein structures of the polypeptides
encoded by each gene are shown in figure 2.
1030: A new member of the kinesin superfamily
The 1030 clone contained an ORF of 80 amino acids that
displayed similarity to members of the kinesin superfamily of molecular motors [25,26]. Northern analysis
using the hamster 1030 probe detected a single band in
testis RNA and weak signals in several other tissues including brain, heart and lung (figure 1). Comparison of the
hamster nucleotide sequence with genomic sequences
revealed highly significant matches within chromosomal
positions 9q21.33 in human, 13B2 in mouse and 17 in
rat. Partial cDNAs from human and macaque also
mapped to the same genetic locus (Table 2). Using the
procedures described in materials and methods we
mapped an 18 exon gene that was followed by a consensus polyadenylation signal in the human, mouse and rat
genome sequences (figure 3A). Exon 1 is located within a
strong CpG island, indicating the likely presence of a promoter in this region. PCR cloning of the human cDNA
was employed to confirm the exonic structure predicted
by the genomic sequences. These studies revealed the
existence of three alternatively spliced products, one containing all 17 coding exons (exon 1 is non-coding) and
two variants lacking either exon 11 or exons 12 and 13
(figures 3B and 3C).

Conceptual translation of the predicted full-length
human mRNA revealed a 1401 amino acid protein that is
highly conserved in macaque, mouse and rat (figures 2
and 4). Database searches revealed that it encodes a previously unreported member of the kinesin superfamily. The
kinesin superfamily in humans and mice is comprised of
at least 45 members, designated with the prefix KIF [26].
Based on this naming system we have assigned the name
KIF27 to this new family member with the suffixes A, B
and C to designate the splice variants described above (figure 3B). Domain mapping within KIF27 revealed an
amino terminal kinesin motor domain and a putative topisomerase domain located in the center of the protein
(figure 2 and 3B). Phylogenic analysis revealed that KIF27
belongs to the N-5 phylogenic group of KIFs [26], which
includes mouse KIF21A and 21B, and human KIF4 (a
group also known as the chromokinesins). Comparisons
with the other members of the N-5 subgroup revealed
greatest similarity within the motor domain (47–50%
identity) (figure 5). In addition, the sequence of the neck
domain of KIF27 located at the C-terminal end of the
motor domain conformed to the consensus sequence for
the neck domain of chromokinesins (figure 3B) [27].

7012
This clone contained an ORF of 73 amino acids that
detected a strong signal by Northern blotting in testis RNA
(figure 1). Genome analysis permitted the mapping of a
common set of 10 exons on human, mouse and rat chromosomes 5, 15 and 2, respectively (Table 2), assembly of
which resulted in translation products of 579, 555 and

563 amino acids, respectively (figure 6). These predictions
were also corroborated by a macaque cDNA (AB070167).
The encoded proteins did not contain any recognizable
functional motifs (figure 3) and were most similar to an
uncharacterized human protein named B29 (figure 2).
B29 was originally identified as a gene located on human
chromosome 18q21 in a search for candidate tumor sup-

The eight cDNAs that detected specific signals in Northern analysis were analyzed further. Key: 1: Clone number refers to the position of the particular clone in a 96 well plate, i.e. 1030 is clone 30 on plate 1. 2: Size of original hamster cDNA insert in base pairs (bp). 3: Each sequence has been

pressor proteins in lung [28]. However, the function of
B29 is unknown and it does not contain any obvious
functional domains. Interestingly, the apparent size of the
detected mRNA is significantly larger than that of the
assembled sequences, suggesting that additional exons are
likely to remain to be discovered. In this regard, gene prediction software identified an additional 35 exons in the
mouse genomic sequence that were partly conserved in
the rat but not present in the human sequence. Final mapping of the genomic structure of 7012 will await further
refineme nt of each genomic sequence.
9004
This clone encoded an ORF of 87 amino acids that did not
display significant similarity to any known proteins in
public databases. Northern blotting revealed a specific signal in hamster testis RNA (figure 1). The clone sequence
mapped to human chromosome 1p13.3, mouse chromosome 3F3 and rat chromosome 2 (Table 2). Human and
macaque cDNAs have recently appeared in the database
that encompass this clone and the sequences of their
encoded proteins are compared in figure 7. These
polypeptides contain a predicted coiled coil region (figure
2) but do not contain other functional domains that
might indicate their possible function(s).
13043
This clone encodes an ORF of 56 amino acids that did not
display significant similarity to known proteins. Northern
blotting revealed a strong signal in testis (figure 1).
Genome comparisons revealed matches on human chromosome 3, mouse chromosome 16 and rat chromosome
11 (Table 2). Human, mouse and rat coding sequences
were assembled using a macaque cDNA (AB070087) as

template (figure 8). Domain mapping identified several
conserved transmembrane domains in each protein as
well as a putative cyclic nucleotide binding site close to
the C-terminus (figure 2). In addition a putative cation
channel was identified in the center of the protein. Further
analysis will be necessary to determine whether this protein functions as a regulatable cation channel.
15014
This clone encodes an ORF of 67 amino acids whose
mRNA was specifically detected in hamster testis RNA
(figure 1). Genome comparisons revealed strong similarities with regions of human chromosome 11, mouse
chromosome 9 and rat chromosome 8 (Table 2). This
clone matches to hypothetical proteins recently added to
the annotation of the human and mouse genomes
(FLJ13386 and XP_134746) as well as a protein encoded
by a macaque cDNA (BAB63125). The alignment in figure
9 accounts for each of these clones as well as additional
exons predicted in the mouse from inter-genome comparisons. The encoded protein contains several predicted
coiled-coil regions but no other identifiable functional
domains (figure 2).
15018
This clone encodes an ORF of 47 amino acids that
detected a specific signal in hamster testis RNA (figure 1).
It mapped to a predic ted 20 exon gene on human chromosome 4, with orthologous (but incomplete) sequences
on mouse chromosome 3 and rat chromosome 2 (Table
2). An orthologous protein has recently been reported
from rat and named sodium channel associated protein
1A (SCAP1A). Alignment of the human and rat proteins is
shown in figure 10. Although the specific function of this

Figure 3
Clone 1030 is derived from a new member of the kinesin superfamily. A. The genomic structure of 1030-derived genes on chromosomes 9, 13 and 17 of human, mouse and rat, respectively, are depicted with numbered vertical bars representing exons. The
rat sequence was construc ted from four separate contigs (RNOR01052409, RNOR01052410, RNOR01052411 and
RNOR01052412, Accession numbers: AABR02079933, AABR02039869, AABR02135902 and AABR02012418) and the arrowheads indicate the positions of short gaps in the genomic sequence. B. PCR analysis of human testis cDNA reveals the presence
of three alternatively spliced isoforms. Human testis cDNA was amplified with primers designed to amplify bases 2118–3129 of
the predicted full length cDNA based on the genomic structure described above. Three discrete products were observed and
are indicated with asterisks. These products were isolated, subcloned and sequenced and corresponded to cDNAs resulting
from alternatively spliced mRNAs. The relative proportions of the three products varied in different cDNA preparations
although the shortest product was generally the predominant product (data not shown). Key: M: 100bp marker ladder; T:
human testis cDNA; T/10: one-tenth of human testis cDNA loaded in previous lane. C. The structure of transcripts derived
from the human gene was analyzed by RT-PCR yielding three mRNAs that result from alternative splicing. The exon distribution of each mRNA is indicated (exon 1 is non-coding and was omitted) along with the size of the predicted protein. This protein has now been named KIF27 with a prefix to indicate the species and a letter to indicate the splice variant. Kinesins are
characterized by a ~300 amino acid motor domain that is located at the N-terminus of KIF27. The N-5 subgroup of kinesins
also possesses a characteristic neck domain at the C-terminal end of the motor domain. A comparison of the KIF27 neck
domain with the corresponding domain of KIF4 is shown, with conserved amino acids indicated between the sequences and in
upper case letters within each sequence. Key: φ: hydrophobic residue.

aligned with the corresponding domains of human KIF4A (NP_046332) and mouse KIF21A (NP_057914) and KIF21B
(NP_064346). The motor and neck domains are underlined in red and blue, respectively. The sequence of each protein is

This clone encodes an ORF of 59 amino acids that was
detected specifically in hamster testis (figure 1). It mapped
to specific regions on chromosomes 10, 19 and 1 in
human, mouse and rat, respectively. A comparison of the
predicted human protein based on several partial human
cDNAs and a mouse protein named oocyte-testis gene 1

similar domain organization is also found in the BOP
(CD8bopposite, recently renamed the SET and MYND
domain protein (SMYD)) family of proteins and alignment of the human protein identified here with SMYD1
(BOP1) from mouse and chicken is shown in figure 13.
The SMYD1 proteins are transcriptional regulatory proteins with chromatin-remodeling activities important in
cardiac tissue, muscle and T lymphocytes [31–33]. Therefore, the new protein identified in this report is likely to
play as yet undefined roles in transcription and has been
assigned the official name SMYD2 to designate its relatedness to SMYD1.

Discussion
19045
This clone detected two distinct transcripts in testis, brain
and heart by Northern blotting (figure 1). The sequence
mapped to regions on chromosomes 1, 1 and 13 in
human, mouse and rat, respectively and we have assembled the orthologous sequences from human, mouse, rat
and Fugu (figure 12). The protein is 433 amino acids in
length in human, mouse and rat (434 in Fugu) and contains two recognizable functional domains characteristic
of proteins with chromatin remodeling activity (figure 2).
The first is an interrupted SET (Su(var)3–9, E(z),
trithorax) domain [29] and the second is a MYND (mye-

In this report, we describe the sequencing and initial characterization of greater than 700 randomly selected ESTs
from the hamster testis. This represents the first such study
carried out in hamster, as dbEST listed just twenty-seven
entries from hamster in January 2003 (release 012403). It
has been widely speculated that the sequencing of additional mammalian genomes will aid in the annotation of
the human genome, particularly in the identification of
previously unidentified coding regions through the mapping of conserved regions in different genomes [34]. We
describe here our initial characterization of eight genes
that were not annotated on human genome sequences at

Figure 6
Alignment of human, macaque, mouse and rat 7012 sequences. The sequenc es of predicted peptides for human (Hs), macaque
(Mf), mouse (Mm) and rat (Rn) orthologues of 7012 were compared using AlignX. Portions of the human sequence were
obtained from XP_059659, a peptide predicted from annotation of the human genome at NCBI. The macaque sequence was
derived from Genbank entry BAB63112, the predicted translation product of a cDNA isolated from macaque testis. The
mouse sequence was obtained by mapping the exon structure of the orthologous gene on the region of mouse chromosome
15. The rat coding sequence was constructed by assembling conserved exons on contigs RNOR01068092, RNOR01068093
and RNOR01068094 (Accession numbers AABR02034780 and AABR02122391). The sequence corresponding to the hamster
clone obtained in this study is indicated with a dotted red underline in the human sequence.

the beginning of our study. Although predicted structures
for some of these genes have appeared recently, our data
represents the first experimental verification of their existence in several cases, particularly in the testis. We were
unable to predict specific functions for the proteins
encoded by six of the genes, however, the other two genes
encoded a new member of the kinesin superfamily
(KIF27) and a protein predicted to play a role in chromatin remodeling.
KIF27: a new kinesin family member
Our studies revealed the existence of a new member of the
kinesin superfamily of microtubule-based molecular
motors, which we have named KIF27. KIF27 RNA was
detected primarily in hamster testis but weaker signals
were also present in several other tissues, suggesting that
this protein may function in numerous cell types. Significant characteristics of the KIF27 genes mapped in human,
mouse and rat included a conserved 18 exon arrangement

and the existence of at least three mRNAs that resulted
from alternative splicing, at least in human. Although partial cDNAs existed for the human and macaque genes in
public databases, we were able to construct full length
cDNA sequences for human, mouse and rat from genomic
comparisons, and to assemble a corresponding sequence
from macaque by joining two previously reported cDNAs.
Kinesins are characterized by a conserved motor domain
of approximately 350 amino acids that may be located at
the amino terminus (KIN-N), carboxy-terminus (KIN-C)
or within the polypeptide (KIN-I) [27] and the motor
domain of KIF27 is located in the N-terminus of the protein. Based on this arrangement and the sequence of the
adjacent neck domain, we assigned KIF27 to the N-5 phyogenetic group of kinesins [27]. The N-5 subgroup is
defined by the human KIF4 protein, which is primarily
localized to the nuclear matrix and associates with
chromosomes during mitosis [35]. In cell division,
nuclear kinesins of this chromokinesin class appear to be

Figure 7
Alignment of human and macaque 9004 sequences. Clone 9004 was found to display significant similarity to cDNAs derived from
human (Hs) and macaque (Mf). The human protein is the predicted translation product of AL832216 and the macaque protein
is the predicted product of AB074456. The complete human cDNA mapped to a 15 exon gene on chromosome 1. Only eleven
of these fifteen exons could be detected in the mouse and rat genome sequences (not shown). The sequence corresponding to
the hamster clone is underlined.

important for the maintenance of sister chromatids on the
metaphase plate [36]. However, additional functions for
nuclear kinesins have recently been uncovered. For example, KIF17a, a member of the N-4 subgroup that is
predominantly expressed in germ cells, was recently
shown to possess transcriptional regulatory properties by
controlling access of the transcriptional activator protein
CREM to a coactivator, ACT [37]. Clearly, functional analysis of the KIF27 polypeptide will be needed to determine
the subcellular location of this protein to determine
whether it may add to the growing number of kinesins
that function in the nucleus. In this regard, although the
carboxy terminal regions of KIF27 and KIF4 display little
significant sequence similarity, both contain a putative
topoisomerase domain that may be important for nuclear
functions (figure 2). In addition, several clusters of basic
amino acids that may function as nuclear localization signals are located in the KIF27 polypeptide.
SMYD2: a putative chromatin remodeling protein
The final clone isolated in our search encodes a 433
amino acid protein whose sequence was highly conserved
from human to pufferfish. This protein, now named
SMYD2, contains SET and MYND domains that are characteristic of proteins with chromatin remodeling capabil-

ities. The SET domain is a common feature of proteins
with histone lysine methyl transferase (HKMT) activity
and has been identified in hundreds of proteins in organisms ranging from bacteria and viruses to humans [38].
The SMYD2 SET domain is separated into two parts (i.e. a
S-ET domain) and is followed by a short cyteine-rich
region that is common in many SET domain proteins (figures 2 and 12). The MYND domain is located between the
two halves of the SET domain and similar domains have
been identified in a number of proteins that function as
transcriptional repressors, including the ETO protein that
is fused to the AML-1 transcription factor in the t(8;21)
translocation in acute myeloid leukemias [39]. The
MYND contains two zinc finger motifs and is a proteinprotein interaction interface responsible for the recruitment of corepressors [39–41].
This domain organization is conserved in several proteins
in public databases, including the recently described
SMYD1 (aka BOP) family of proteins [31]. Three isoforms
of SMYD1 have been reported thus far (referred to by their
original names, m-BOP1, m-BOP2 and t-BOP) that are
products of a single gene that result from either alternative
splicing or promoter usage [31–33]. m-BOP is essential
for cardiac differentiation and morphogenesis while t-

Alignment of human, macaque, mouse and rat 13043 sequences. This alignment was anchored on a single cDNA isolated from
macaque (AB0770087). This sequence was compared to the human (Hs), mouse (Mm) and rat (Rn) genomic sequences at
Ensembl and individual exons were assigned. One additional potential exon was assigned based on similarity between genomic
sequences based on PipMaker analysis. The human and mouse sequences listed here match partially with predicted proteins in
both human and mouse (ENSP0000306627 and XP_156183, respectively) but conform more to the template predicted by the
macaque sequence. The rat sequence was constructed from genomic sequences AABR02142366, AABR02119574,
AABR02127843, AABR02117677 and AABR02097473. Predicted transmembrane domains are underlined in red in the human
sequence and a potential nucleotide binding domain is underlined in blue. A putative cation channel in the human, mouse and
rat proteins is double underlined in the mouse sequence. The region of similarity to the original hamster clone is indicated with
a red dotted underline.

BOP is expressed in cytotoxic T lymphoctes. Studies are
currently underway to examine the function(s) of SMYD2
in testis and heart.

Genomic studies in the hamster
The impetus for this study arose from the need to perform
microarray experiments to investigate the molecular
changes elicited by environmental toxicants on male
reproduction function in hamster. Comparisons
performed between the limited numbers of hamster

Figure 9
Alignment of human, macaque and mouse 15014 sequences. The sequences of human (Hs), mouse (Mm) and macaque (Mf) 15014
orthologues were compared in Align X. The human sequence was derived from XP_089976 (LOC159989). The mouse
sequence was obtained from a combination of XP_134746 (LOC234964), a hypothetical protein predicted from the NCBI
annotation process along with additional exons predicted from comparisons between the human cDNA and the mouse
genomic sequence. The macaque sequence was obtained from Genbank entry BAB63125. Gaps in the human sequence indicate
the likely presence of alternative exo ns that may undergo alternative splicing. This hypothesis was supported by exon mapping
in both the mouse and rat genome sequences (data not shown). We were unable to detect additional exons in the mouse
genomic sequence that might encode the N-terminal sequences in the human protein sequence. The similarity to the hamster
clone is underlined.

sequences in public databases with ortho logous
sequences from the mouse suggested that, despite the
close taxonomic relationship between hamster and
mouse, evolutionary divergence in coding sequences was
sufficiently great in certain cases that reagents developed
for the mouse would be of limited use for genomic studies
in the hamster. This conclusion was supported by experimental observations in our laboratories indicating that
probes derived from rat and mouse cDNAs yield inconsistent results in Northern blotting under stringent
hybridization conditions (data not shown). The reagents
described here will now permit the initiation of genomic
studies in the hamster.

Methods
RNA, cDNA and plasmid preparation
Total RNA was prepared from testes of adult Syrian golden
hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus). Poly A+ RNA was isolated
using the poly A Spin™ mRNA isolation kit (New England
Biolabs, Beverly, MA). 5 µg of polyA+ RNA was converted

to double stranded cDNA using the cDNA Synthesis Kit
(Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD). The cDNA was
then digested to completion with DpnII and
electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel. Five populations
of digested cDNAs in size ranges between 100 and 800 bp
were excised from the gel and purified using Qiaex II resin
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Each population of cDNA was
ligated into a pBluescript vector that had been digested
with BamHI and alkaline phosphatased to decrease the
rate of self-ligation. The ligations were transformed into
DH5α supercompetent cells (Life Technologies) and positive clones were identified by blue-white selection. The
success of the cloning procedure was initially monitored
by picking 5 clones from each group, preparing plasmid
DNA and sequencing. These preliminary studies indicated
that the most useful clone sets were those derived from
cDNAs in the 100–300 bp range. White colonies from
these two sets were carefully picked and used to inoculate
single cells of a 96 well culture block with each well
containing 1.2 ml of TB (1.2% Tryptone, 2.4% yeast

carbenecillin. The bacteria were grown for 20 hours at
37°C and glycerol stocks were subsequently prepared
using a Biomek 3000 robot (Beckman-Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA). Fresh cultures (in 1 ml of 2X LB (2% Tryptone,
1% yeast extract, 1% NaCl) plus 50 µg/ml carbenecillin)
were inoculated from the glycerol stocks using a 96-well
needle transfer device and grown as before. Plasmid DNA
was prepared using the full lysate protocol of the
Montage™ Plasmid Miniprep96 Kit (Millipore, Bedford,
MA). Typical yields of plasmid DNA ranged from 5–10 µg
in 50 µl volume.
Sequencing
Plasmid DNA was diluted four-fold in water and 2 µl of
the diluted sample was sequenced in 96-well format using
the Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Beckman
Coulter, Inc.). The reactions were cleaned up by an ethanol precipitation step in which 35 µl of 10 mg/ml glycogen, 70 µl of 0.5 M EDTA, 70 µl of 1.5 M Sodium Acetate
(pH 4.8) was first mixed with the sequencing reaction (6.6
µl). 20 µl of 95% ethanol was added and the plate was
centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 45 minutes. The pellets were
washed twice with 100 µl of 70% ethanol, air dried and
dissolved in 25 µl of molecular biology grade formamide.
A drop of mineral oil was overlaid on each reaction and
these were then run on a CEQ2000 capillary array
sequencer (Beckman Coulter, Inc.).
Sequence analysis
Raw sequence data was first imported into the Contig
Express component of the Vector NTI suite of sequence
analysis programs (InforMax, Inc. Bethesda, MD). Each
clone was named according to its position in the original
96-well plate, for example, clone 1030 came from position 30 in plate 1. Vector sequences were first scanned in
batch mode for the presence of vector-derived sequences
using Contig Express and these sequences were trimmed
before proceeding. In some cases, manual processing of
the sequences was necessary using the VecScreen program
at the National Canter for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI)
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/VecScreen/VecScreen.html. The presence of DpnII sites at either end of
the clone simplified the removal of vector sequences. The
sequences were concatenated in batches of 96 into a text
file using FASTA format and submitted for a batch
BLASTN search using the interface program BLASTCL3.
This search returned the three top matches into an output
file. No further analysis was performed in those cases
where a match with a known gene was clearly established,
and the clone was annotated as the hamster orthologue of
a known gene. A series of additional comparisons were
performed if a clear relationship between a hamster clone
and known sequence was not established by this initial
search. The most useful additional comparison was a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/4/22

BLASTX search, which compares the translated sequence
of the input clone in all six frames to the peptide
sequences in GenBank. This search clarified the identity of
several additional hamster clones. 200 clones did not
match to known sequences and were analyzed to determine whether they might represent potentially novel
genes. First, the output sequences were translated in all
frames to determine whether a complete open reading
frame (ORF) was present. If so, the clones were resequenced on both strands to ensure that the sequence was
correct. Promising sequences were compared to the public
version of the annotated human sequence (v 9.30a.1) at
Ensembl http://www.ensembl.org to find matches with
human chromosomal sequences. Further comparisons
were performed against the mouse (v 9.3a.1), rat (v 9.1.1),
zebrafish (v 9.08.1), pufferfish (v 9.1.1) and mosquito (v
9.1a.1) genome sequence in the same database. When
matching genomic loci were identified, approximately
100,000 bp of genome sequence surrounding the match
was imported into Vector NTI and submitted to gene prediction software programs to determine if the hamster
sequences were located within exons of predicted genes.
Two gene prediction programs were used FGENESH http:/
/www.softberry.com/berry.phtml and GENEMARK http:/
/opal.biology.gatech.edu/GeneMark/
eukhmm.cgi?org=H.sapiens. Predicted cDNA sequences
were then assembled into contiguous files and subjected
to further comparisons against cDNA and EST databases
at NCBI. Genome structures were further examined using
PipMaker, a program that supports comparisons of large
DNA fragments and identifies short conserved regions of
similarity, such as exons. The predicted protein sequences
of the derived cDNAs were analyzed for the presence of
functional domains using the conserved domain function
of BLAST at NCBI as well as the Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool at http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de.
Protein structures were annotated in Vector NTI and published in Canvas v7.0 (Deneba Systems, Inc., Miami, FL).
Sequences were submitted to the appropriate databases at
the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI). Specifically, EST sequences were submitted to
dbEST under accession numbers BI431001-BI431008 and
CB884447-CB885166. Human KIF27 sequences were
submitted to Genbank under accession numbers
AY237536-AY237538. Sequences defined by annotation
of previously available sequences were submitted to the
Third Party Annotation database under accession numbers BK001053-BK001057 and BK001326-BK001332.
The Human Genome Organization (HUGO) nomenclature committee has approved proposed gene names.
Northern analysis
Total RNA was purified from various hamster tissues using
TriZol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). 20 µg of each
RNA was electrophoresed through a 1% agarose-formal-

dehyde gel and transferred to a Nylon membrane (Micron
Separations, Westborough, MA). The RNA was crosslinked to the membrane by exposure to UV light and
hybridized with specific probes labeled with 32P-dCTP
(Perkin Elmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) using the PrimeIt random prime labeling kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).
The hybridization procedure was performed as described
before [42]. Several duplicate membranes were prepared
and the radioactive probe was stripped after each round of
hybridization by boiling for 10 minutes in 10 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 1% SDS. The specific probes
were prepared by digesting the appropriate pBluescript
plasmid with XbaI and EcoRI, separating the fragment on
a 1.5% agarose gel followed by extraction using the Qiaex
II extraction kit (Qiagen).
PCR cloning of human KIF27 cDNAs
PCR primers based on the predicted human KIF27
genomic sequence were designed for PCR cloning of overlapping regions of human KIF27 cDNAs. PCR reactions
were performed using human testis Marathon RACEReady cDNA (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using conditions
described previously [43]. PCR products were subcloned
in to the pGEM-Teasy plasmid and sequenced. The
sequences were then assembled into full length cDNAs
using the Vector NTI sequence analysis suite of programs.
The primers used for the reaction shown in figure 2 were:
5' AACTAGATGTAGAAGTCGTTCATGGATTC 3' and
5'TTCCAGTAAGTTCAGGCGAGTTG 3'.
