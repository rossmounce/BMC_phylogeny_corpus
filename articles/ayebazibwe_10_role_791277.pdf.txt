Abstract
Background: To study the role of African buffalos (Syncerus caffer) in the maintenance of foot-and-mouth disease
in Uganda, serum samples were collected from 207 African buffalos, 21 impalas (Aepyceros melampus), 1 giraffe
(Giraffa camelopardalis), 1 common eland (Taurotragus oryx), 7 hartebeests (Alcelaphus buselaphus) and 5
waterbucks (Kobus ellipsiprymnus) from four major National Parks in Uganda between 2005 and 2008. Serum
samples were screened to detect antibodies against foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) non-structural proteins
(NSP) using the Ceditest® FMDV NS ELISA. Solid Phase Blocking ELISAs (SPBE) were used to determine the serotypespecificity of antibodies against the seven serotypes of FMDV among the positive samples. Virus isolation and
sequencing were undertaken to identify circulating viruses and determine relatedness between them.
Results: Among the buffalo samples tested, 85% (95% CI = 80-90%) were positive for antibodies against FMDV
non-structural proteins while one hartebeest sample out of seven (14.3%; 95% CI = -11.6-40.2%) was the only
positive from 35 other wildlife samples from a variety of different species. In the buffalo, high serotype-specific
antibody titres (≥ 80) were found against serotypes O (7/27 samples), SAT 1 (23/29 samples), SAT 2 (18/32 samples)
and SAT 3 (16/30 samples). Among the samples titrated for antibodies against the four serotypes O, SAT 1, SAT 2
and SAT 3, 17/22 (77%; CI = 59.4-94.6%) had high titres against at least two serotypes.
FMDV isolates of serotypes SAT 1 (1 sample) and SAT 2 (2 samples) were obtained from buffalo probang samples
collected in Queen Elizabeth National Park (QENP) in 2007. Sequence analysis and comparison of VP1 coding
sequences showed that the SAT 1 isolate belonged to topotype IV while the SAT 2 isolates belonged to different
lineages within the East African topotype X.
Conclusions: Consistent detection of high antibody titres in buffalos supports the view that African buffalos play
an important role in the maintenance of FMDV infection within National Parks in Uganda. Both SAT 1 and SAT 2
viruses were isolated, and serological data indicate that it is also likely that FMDV serotypes O and SAT 3 may be
present in the buffalo population. Detailed studies should be undertaken to define further the role of wildlife in
the epidemiology of FMDV in East Africa.

Background
Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious
viral disease that affects all cloven-hoofed wild and
domestic animals [1] and has serious socio-economic
consequences [2]. The epidemiology of FMD in Africa is
unique, complex and poorly understood. Seven FMDV

serotypes have been defined: O, A, C, Asia 1, and the
Southern African Territories (SAT) 1, SAT 2 and SAT
3, of which all but Asia 1 have occurred in most East
African countries including Uganda [3]. Wildlife hosts,
especially African buffalos (Syncerus caffer), are believed
to play an important role as reservoirs for the SAT serotypes of FMDV [4] and the disease is sometimes transmitted between and within different livestock and
wildlife species [5-9].

In Africa, the epidemiology of FMD is complicated by
the widespread movement of animals, the wide host
range of the virus involving wild and domestic animal
reservoirs and the presence of multiple strains and substrains. Moreover, the spread of the disease is facilitated
by the ability of the virus to survive for relatively long
periods in raw meat, raw milk or outside the host
[1,10,11]. Infection of cloven-hoofed animals can result
in development of a carrier state in which case FMDV
may be found in such animals for more than 28 days
after infection [12-14], and thus may influence the epidemiology of the disease and interfere with its diagnosis
and control. The duration of the carrier state can be
prolonged after recovery from acute disease; in the case
of cattle for up to 3.5 years [14]. The epidemiology of
FMD in wildlife populations has not been fully documented but it has been established that African buffalo
herds can harbour the infection for up to 24 years [15].
They act as long term maintenance hosts for the SAT
serotypes (SAT 1, SAT 2 and SAT 3) of FMDV with no
obvious clinical disease [4,16]. Other cloven-hoofed
wildlife species may develop antibodies against FMD
infections; however, their roles in excretion, transmission and persistence of FMDV either have not been
conclusively studied or have been shown to be less
important than the role of the buffalos [7,17,18]. In
South Africa, the impala (Aepyceros melampus) has
been shown to play a potentially significant role in the
propagation of FMD outbreaks between livestock and
wildlife [19].
FMD outbreaks are often encountered in cattle in
Uganda but the roles of different wild and domestic
hosts in the maintenance and spread of FMDV have
not been exhaustively studied. Available data on
seventy-three Ugandan FMD outbreaks, mainly in cattle, and a few isolates from apparently healthy buffalos,
indicate that between the years 1958 and 2000,
approximately 31% were attributed to serotype O, 26%
to A, 25% to SAT 2, 14% to SAT 1, 3% to C and 1% to
SAT 3 [3]. FMDV serotypes SAT 1, SAT 2 and SAT 3
have been found in many other sub-Saharan African
countries, however, the viruses found in East Africa
seem to belong to distinct lineages [20-22]. The possible role played by the African buffalos in the epidemiology of FMDV serotypes other than SATs has not
been established, since only one single study in Queen
Elizabeth National Park has reported antibodies against
serotypes O and A [23], thus further research is
required in this field.
This study was undertaken to evaluate the role of
African buffalos and other wildlife species in the maintenance of different FMDV serotypes under natural conditions in selected National Parks in Uganda.

Results
Antibodies elicited against FMDV NSP

Between 2005 and 2008, 207 samples were collected
from African buffalos and 35 samples were collected
from other wildlife species (21 impala (Aepyceros melampus), 1 giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis), 1 common
eland (Taurotragus oryx), 7 hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus) and 5 waterbuck, (Kobus ellipsiprymnus)) in
Queen Elizabeth National Park (QENP), Lake Mburo
National Park (LMNP), Kidepo Valley National Park
(KVNP) and Murchison Falls National Park (MFNP).
One hundred and seventy-six out of 207 buffalo samples
(85%; 95% CI = 80-90%) tested positive for antibodies
against FMDV NSP (Table 1), while only one of seven
hartebeest samples (14.3%; 95% CI = -11.6-40.2%) from
among those of other wildlife species tested positive in
the NSP ELISA.
Screening for serotype-specific antibodies using the Solid
Phase Blocking ELISA (SPBE)

Ninety-six percent (131/137) of the buffalo samples
tested were apparently positive for antibodies against
more than one serotype in the screening dilution 1:5 in
SPBE. The proportion of positive samples was higher for
serotypes SAT 1, SAT 2, SAT 3 and to a lesser extent
serotype O, than for serotypes A, C and Asia 1. One
hartebeest tested positive for SAT 1, SAT 2, and SAT 3
(data not shown). Cross reactivity between the different
serotypes is known to occur in such assays [17].

Titration of selected samples in relevant
serotype-specific SPBEs

Samples from QENP, MFNP and LMNP were selected
for titration on the basis of positive screening results
and sufficient volumes with the objective of comparison
of results across multiple years. A total of 37 buffalo
samples were titrated in the relevant serotype-specific
SPBEs as follows; O (27), SAT 1 (29), SAT 2 (32) and
SAT 3 (30) as shown in Table 2. In this study, samples

with titres of ≥ 80 were considered positive based on
the highest dilution at which non-specific reactions
tended to disappear and the results of a previous study
[24]. All the sera titrated for antibodies against serotypes
A, C and Asia 1 had titres below 40 and were therefore
considered negative (data not shown), while titres of 80
and above were found in the majority of sera titrated for
antibodies against serotypes O (26%; 95% CI = 9.542.6%), SAT 1 (79%; 95% CI = 64.6-94.1%), SAT 2 (56%;

FMDV serotype O were also positive for at least two of
the SAT serotypes. Six of 22 (27%; 95% CI = 8.7-45.9%)
samples titrated for antibodies against all three SAT serotypes as well as against serotype O were positive for all
four serotypes, while 17 (77%; 95% CI = 59.5-94.6%)
were positive for at least two serotypes. Nine of the 24
samples titrated for antibodies against all three SAT serotypes were positive for antibodies against all 3 serotypes, including at least one buffalo in each of QENP,
LMNP and MFNP.
Isolation and identification of FMDV

Three FMDV isolates were obtained in primary bovine
thyroid cells from among nine buffalo probang samples
collected on the same day in January 2007 in QENP,
and were identified by antigen ELISA as SAT 1 (1 sample from BUF 17) and SAT 2 (from BUF 6 and BUF 10).
BUF 17 had a higher titre of antibodies against SAT 1
(160) compared to those against SAT 2 (80) and SAT 3
(20) (Table 2), while the sera of BUF 6 and BUF 10

were not titrated in the SPBE. Following RT-PCR, the
near complete genome sequences were obtained and
blasted in the GenBank data base. The sequencing data
was entirely consistent with the antigen ELISA results in
terms of serotype identification. Due to the limited
number of full length SAT serotype sequences that
are available, comparative analysis of the virus sequences
was restricted to the VP1 coding region. These
sequences were compared to reference strains for the
defined topotypes [25] to assess the phylogenetic relationships (Figure 1 and 2). The SAT 1 isolate (SAT 1/
UGA/1/07, [GenBank HM067706]) was most closely
related (pair wise identity of 83%) to a previous isolate
obtained from a buffalo in Uganda in 1970 (SAT 1/
UGA BUFF/21/70, Knowles et al., unpublished) belonging to the East African topotype IV (Figure 1). The two
SAT 2 isolates were closely related to each other (pair
wise identity of 90.4%) and grouped with representatives
of the topotype X viruses (Figure 2). One of the isolates,
SAT 2/UGA/1/07 [GenBank HM067705], was also
related to an isolate from cattle in the neighbouring
country of Democratic Republic of Congo (pair wise

buffalo in Uganda (SAT 2/UGA/1998, accession number

multiple amino acid differences between the SAT 2 viruses
within the G-H loop (residues 140-160) and the C-

terminal region of VP1 which correspond to known antigenic sites (Figure 3). The recent SAT 2 buffalo isolates
had some amino acid differences, within the hyper-variable regions surrounding the conserved RGD cell attachment motifs, compared to those obtained from postoutbreak slaughtered cattle in Uganda in 2004 [26].

clustered particularly within the regions 135-160 (G-H loop) and near the extreme C-terminus (residues 190-205). Such differences may be
important in influencing the antigenicity of these various strains.

Discussion
Antibodies against FMDV were detected by both the
Ceditest® FMDV NS kit and the SPBE in over 80% of
screened buffalo samples. Among the samples of wildlife
species other than the buffalos, it was only one from a
hartebeest that had detectable antibodies against FMDV.
Due to small sample sizes in other tested wildlife

species, it is, at this stage, not possible to explain or
conclude anything about the importance of these other
species relative to buffalos. However, the findings of this
study do relate to those of other studies done elsewhere.
It has been indicated that a number of wild ruminants
become persistently infected with FMDV but it is only
the African buffalos that have been shown to spread the

Ayebazibwe et al. BMC Veterinary Research 2010, 6:54
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1746-6148/6/54

infection during the carrier state [16,27]. The situation
seems to be different within the impala population in
the Kruger National Park in South Africa, where clinical
FMD has been reported, and subclinical infections have
been shown to occur much more regularly than previously suspected [19]. It is hypothesized that during the
acute state of the disease some species may act as intermediaries in the transmission of FMD, mainly between
buffalos and cattle [6,18,19]. The current findings concur with reports of very low seroprevalence of antibodies against FMDV in non-buffalo wildlife species (4.4%)
compared to buffalos (67.7%) in Eastern Africa [17]. The
Ceditest® NSP ELISA seemed to work well in detecting
antibodies against FMDV in buffalo samples, with estimates of sensitivity and specificity at 87.7% and 87.3%,
respectively [17].
In this study, the majority of the buffalos were positive
for antibodies against FMDV NSP during each of the
sampling trips between the years 2005 and 2008. This
indicates that infection is almost always present in the
sampled National Parks. Persistent infections within buffalo herds have been reported to occur in Southern
Africa due to most calves becoming infected with the
three SAT serotypes, when maternal antibodies wane at
2-6 months of age, thereby creating an opportunity for
transmitting the infection to other susceptible species
[28-30]. The current findings justify the need to conduct
much more in-depth age-stratified longitudinal studies
to confirm the serotypes and patterns of FMD in different localities in Uganda.
SPBE screening results (dilution 1:5) were difficult to
interpret due to the large percentage (96%) of animals
apparently testing positive for antibodies against more
than one serotype. However, titrations showed that
reactions in the serotype A, C and Asia 1 antibody
ELISAs were most likely cross-reactions. This fits well
with the lack of any reports of such serotypes in wildlife in Uganda, the almost complete disappearance of
serotype C from the world and the fact that serotype
Asia 1 has never been reported anywhere on the
African continent [3].
This is the first time the SPBEs have been used in an
unvaccinated animal population like the buffalos, which
probably harbour persistent infections with multiple serotypes. For future studies in endemic conditions, sera
should be screened in dilution 1:10, and the SPBE ELISAs should be improved by using more purified antigens
and more recent FMDV strains representing the FMDV
topotypes currently circulating in Uganda for the production of reagents and positive sera, thereby possibly
enhancing the specificity.
Screening of samples by serotype-specific SPBE
worked well for selection for further titration, thereby
significantly reducing the associated working time and

expense. Titrations demonstrated the highest antibody
titres against serotypes SAT 1, SAT 2 and SAT 3 with
the exception of one out of four buffalos sampled in
MFNP in 2007 that had equally high titres against serotypes O and SAT 1.
It is thus evident from the present study, that buffalos
were exposed to the FMDV SAT serotypes, and in
MFNP probably also to serotype O. These findings suggest that African buffalos may play an important role as
natural reservoirs of the SAT serotypes of FMDV in
East Africa and are consistent with what has been established in Southern Africa [31-33]. Detection of antibodies against serotype O in this study confirms previous
reports of antibodies against other FMDV serotypes
than the SATs in buffalos in QENP [23].
The distribution of serotypes varied between the
National Parks and between sampling trips. In this
study, a large proportion of the buffalo samples had
high antibody titres against more than one serotype of
FMDV (77%), and this is consistent with previous
research findings [17,23,24]. The relative antibody prevalences found in this study (SAT 1 > SAT 2 > SAT 3 >
O) differ from those of Bronsvoort et al. [17], who
found that antibodies against SAT 2 were the most prevalent, followed by SAT 1 and finally SAT 3, in African
buffalos in Eastern Africa. This is likely due to spatial
and temporal differences in the distribution of the
infection.
Three FMDV isolates consisting of one SAT 1 from a
buffalo in one herd and two SAT 2 from buffalos in
another herd were obtained from three out of nine African buffalo probang samples collected on the same day
in 2007 in QENP indicating the presence of either current or persistent infection. The three isolates were
characterised using antigen ELISA and by full-length
sequencing. The VP1 coding regions of the two SAT 2
isolates showed that these viruses belonged to the same
topotype (X) but different lineages, with 90.4% pair wise
identity. One of the SAT 2 isolates (SAT 2/UGA/1/07)
was most closely related with a previous isolate (SAT 2/
ZAI/1/82 [AF367100]) from cattle in the neighbouring
country of Democratic Republic of Congo (89.5% pair
wise identity) indicating a possibility of cross-border and
wildlife-livestock transmission. The SAT 1 sequence was
closest to a representative of the topotype IV isolate
obtained in 1970 from a buffalo in Uganda (SAT 1/
UGA BUFF/21/70, N. Knowles, unpublished) with a pair
wise identity of 83%. It is clear from this study that the
viruses obtained are different from each other. These
differences may be of particular significance during
selection of strains that may be considered for vaccine
manufacture and effective control of foot-and-mouth
disease due to a range of viruses that may be shared
between wildlife and livestock. The isolation and

Ayebazibwe et al. BMC Veterinary Research 2010, 6:54
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1746-6148/6/54

characterization of these viruses from buffalo confirms
the presence of SAT 1 and SAT 2 types of FMDV as
demonstrated serologically by SPBEs. More molecular
epidemiological studies are necessary for precise elucidation of the diversity of FMDV genotypes and the possible challenges involved in matching such strains with
those included in vaccines produced for use in Uganda.
Molecular studies including the current SAT 1 virus in
this study suggest that a unique group of SAT 1 viruses
exist in Uganda and, may necessitate a regional
approach for effective control [34].
Consistent evidence of antibodies against multiple serotypes of FMDV in several Ugandan National Parks and
the isolation of SAT 1 and SAT 2 in QENP in 30% of
nine apparently healthy buffalos indicates that wildlife
maintains FMDV infections, and thus re-affirms recent
findings in buffalo sera collected during 2001-2003 [34].
These findings combined with serological evidence of
exposure of cattle grazing in QENP to the SAT serotypes [35] emphasizes the need to study FMDV isolates
from these two populations to establish whether FMDV
is transferred between them and at which rate.
FMDV serotype SAT 3 was isolated from a buffalo in
QENP in 1970 [36] and this study indicates that this
serotype may still be present. It is not clear why outbreaks caused by serotype SAT 3 have never been confirmed in cattle, while outbreaks of FMDV SAT 1 and
SAT 2 are quite frequent in the region.
The findings of this study highlight the challenges
involved in the diagnosis and control of FMD in endemic areas and emphasize the need for optimization of
the methods used for serological diagnosis and for serotyping of FMDV outbreaks. There is need for more studies to investigate detailed epidemiology of FMD in
wildlife in Uganda.

Conclusions
African buffalos are important for the maintenance of
FMDV within National Parks of Uganda. They play an
important epidemiological role in the circulation of
FMDV serotypes SAT 1 and SAT 2, and may also harbour serotype SAT 3 and O infections.
Methods
Study area

The present study was kindly approved by Uganda
Wildlife Authority (UWA/PMR/RES/50) and wildlife
samples were collected from four major National Parks
in Uganda, namely; QENP, LMNP, MFNP and KVNP
(Figure 4). These National Parks were chosen on the
basis of the high chance of livestock-wildlife interactions. Compared to other National Parks in Uganda,
they are generally flat or gently sloping and not densely
covered by vegetation thereby facilitating the exercise of

Page 8 of 13

darting and follow up of the sedated animals. Such
National Parks are also home to sizeable buffalo populations with estimates of about 6,807 animals in QENP,
132 in LMNP, 8,200 in MFNP and 400 in KVNP [37].
All the national parks are unfenced and hence provide
possibilities for livestock-wildlife interactions.
Due to the large buffalo population and the very high
chances of livestock-wildlife interactions, more samples
were collected in QENP than in the other parks.
Sampling

Apart from the impala, chemical capture was used for
immobilization of animals of choice [38,39]. The original
target of sampling at least 10% of each herd was not
possible. Most buffalo herds would disperse and sometimes scatter to inaccessible areas upon darting one or a
few of them. At times it would be impossible to locate
herds in the National Parks. Animals were darted with a
Dan-Inject dart gun. Two cars were used; one for the
identifying and darting the animals and the other for
tracking the herds, general field support and tracing the
darted animal. Buffalo herds were located and animals
moving at the edge of the group identified and darted.
The anaesthetic combination was 8-10 mg Etorphine
(Kyron, South Africa) and 70-90 mg Xylazine (Kyron,
South Africa). The sedated animal would be cautiously
located and approached, held by the horns and head,
blindfolded and the mouth opened and the tongue
pulled out for examination for lesions and ensuring continuous respiration before collection of serum and probang samples. After sampling, the sedative was reversed
by use of a combination of 14-18 mg Diprenorphine
and 60-70 mg Yohimbine (Kyron, South Africa) by
intravenous infusion through the ear vein. The age of
the buffalos was estimated from the teeth. All buffalos
fell within the age group used for rinderpest serosurveillance (1.8-20 years). Non-buffalo species other than the
impala were also darted following similar techniques as
defined by Kock et al. [39]. Due to significant challenges
of chemical capture, impala were instead physically
restrained after dazzling them with strong light directed
at the eyes at night time, during periods of little or no
moonlight [40].
A total of 134 African buffalo samples and 21 impala
samples were collected during 16 trips in the years 2007
and 2008 (Table 1). The samples from giraffe (1), hartebeest (7) and waterbuck (5), were jointly obtained
through the on-going wildlife health research and monitoring programmes by Uganda Wildlife Authority in
2007. Eighty African buffalo samples and 1 Eland sample had been collected during the rinderpest serosurveillance exercise between the years 2005 and 2006.
Probang samples were preserved in 0.04 M phosphate
buffered saline (PBS), transported under liquid nitrogen

Serum was separated from blood and stored at -20°C in

Screening for antibodies to FMDV non-structural proteins

207 buffalo samples were screened for antibodies against
non-structural proteins (NSP) of FMDV using the commercial Ceditest FMDV NS® kit (Cedi diagnostics BV,
Netherlands) [41]. This test is currently marketed as
Priocheck® FMDV NS by Prionics® AG, Switzerland. In
addition, samples from impala (n = 21), hartebeest (n =
7), waterbuck (n = 5), eland (n = 1) and giraffe (n = 1)
were tested in the same way.
Serotype-specific Solid Phase Blocking ELISA (SPBE)

137 African buffalo serum samples, of which seven
were not tested for antibodies against NSP, were

screened (dilution 1:5) for serotype-specific antibodies
against FMDV using an in-house SPBE system modified from Have and Holm-Jensen [42] and described in
detail by Balinda et al. [43]. The O, A, C and Asia 1
tests in this ELISA system have been used at the
National Veterinary Institute, Danish Technical University (Lindholm), for many years; they have been
validated for cattle and swine (ISO/IEC 17025) and
used for many other ruminants and Camelidae with
good results, and they appear to work well on all species (Alexandersen, unpublished results). The SPBE
tests for antibodies against the SAT-serotypes were
more recent and were still undergoing evaluation. Closely related ELISA tests for the SAT-serotypes have
been set up and used under African conditions for
detecting antibodies against multiple FMDV serotypes
and shown to perform well [43,44].

For each well, optical density (OD) as a percentage of
the mean OD of four wells with negative control sera
(ODP) was calculated according to the formula: ODP =
((sample OD 450 - OD 620 )/(mean of (negative control
sera OD450 - OD620)) × 100. Samples were considered
positive, if ODP was lower than 50% in the antibody
tests for O, SAT 1, SAT 2 and SAT 3, 45% for A and
35% for C and Asia 1.
Based on the serological status and availability of sufficient amounts, 37 positive samples were selected and
titrated (up to dilution 1:640) in the relevant serotype
specific SPBEs. Titres were expressed as the reciprocal
of the highest positive dilution.
Due to limited sample volumes and the smaller number of trips made, serotype specific SPBE studies did not
include KVNP.
FMD Virus isolation and antigen ELISA

The methodology of virus isolation from the OP samples was adopted from the standard procedure described
by the World Organisation for Animal Health [45].
Briefly, 50μl of undiluted sample and a 1:10 dilution of
the sample were each inoculated into 5 wells of a 96well microtitre plate with monolayers of primary bovine
thyroid (BTY) cells and 100μl of Eagles media with 2%
fetal calf serum. A row of wells with negative control
sera including buffer was inserted between each sample.
The cell cultures were incubated at 37°C and examined
for cytopathic effect (CPE) for 2-4 days. Negative cultures were passaged onto new bovine thyroid (BTY)
monolayers once. First and second passage cultures with
CPE were harvested and serotyped using an in-house
antigen ELISA set up at the National Veterinary Institute, Lindholm, Denmark, based on the description by
OIE [45]. Briefly, the rabbit and guinea pig hyperimmune sera were the same as used in the in-house SPBE
for serotype-specific antibodies against FMDV described
above. The samples were tested in duplicate, and for
each serotype each plate included two wells with strong
positive control sera, two wells with weak positive control sera and two wells with negative control sera, all
consisting of cell-culture materials. The tests for serotypes O, A, C and Asia 1 were quality assured (ISO/IEC
17025), while the tests for serotypes SAT 1, SAT 2 and
SAT 3 were more recently set up and still undergoing
evaluation.

AGACCTGGAAAGACCAGGC-3’), G 15 H, and pdN6
(random hexamers). To generate 15 overlapping PCR
fragments for near full length genome sequencing, 15
PCR-tubes were prepared containing: 33.1 μl of water,
5.0 μl 5 × AmpliTaq Gold buffer, 4.0 μl MgCl2 (25 mM),
0.4 μl dNTPs (2.5 mM each), 2.5 Units of Amplitaq
Gold® (Applied Biosystems, UK) and 5.0 μl of template
cDNA. To each of these tubes, 1.0 μl of respective fragment-specific forward and reverse primers, each at a concentration of 25 pmol/μl was added to make a total
volume of 50 μl.
The primers used for the VP1 coding region are
shown in Table 3. The PCR (Perkin Elmer PE 9700) was
set and ran at 95°C for 5 minutes to activate Amplitaq
enzyme followed by five cycles (95°C for 15 seconds, 55°
C for 30 seconds with less by 1 second in each subsequent cycle and then 72°C for 1 minute and 20 seconds), 40 cycles (95°C for 15 seconds, 50°C for 30
seconds, and 72°C for 1 minute and 20 seconds-adding
1 second per cycle) and lastly at 72°C for 7 minutes and
kept at 4°C. To confirm the presence or absence of PCR
products, gel electrophoresis was undertaken using 1.2%
agarose containing 0.005% ethidium bromide. Amplicons were extracted from the gel using the Qiaquick®
(Qiagen, Germany) gel extraction kit and sent to
AGOWA (Germany) for cycle sequencing.
Sequence analysis

A phylogenetic tree of the virus sequences was inferred
using the Neighbor-Joining method [46]. The bootstrap
consensus tree inferred from 1000 replicates is taken
to represent the evolutionary history of the taxa analyzed [47]. The evolutionary distances were computed
using the Kimura 2-parameter method [48] and are in
the units of the number of base substitutions per site.
The sequences studied were all from the VP1 coding
region of the current FMDV isolates and the reference
topotypes (Table 4). All positions containing gaps and
missing data were eliminated from the dataset. There
