anthrax epidemic

Abstract
Background: In Italy, anthrax is endemic but occurs sporadically. During the summer of 2004, in the Pollino
National Park, Basilicata, Southern Italy, an anthrax epidemic consisting of 41 outbreaks occurred; it claimed the
lives of 124 animals belonging to different mammal species. This study is a retrospective molecular epidemiological
investigation carried out on 53 isolates collected during the epidemic. A 25-loci Multiple Locus VNTR Analysis
(MLVA) MLVA was initially performed to define genetic relationships, followed by an investigation of genetic
diversity between epidemic strains through Single Nucleotide Repeat (SNR) analysis.
Results: 53 Bacillus anthracis strains were isolated. The 25-loci MLVA analysis identified all of them as belonging to
a single genotype, while the SNR analysis was able to detect the existence of five subgenotypes (SGTs), allowing a
detailed epidemic investigation. SGT-1 was the most frequent (46/53); SGTs 2 (4/53), 3 (1/53) 4 (1/53) and 5 (1/53)
were detected in the remaining seven isolates.
Conclusions: The analysis revealed the prevalent spread, during this epidemic, of a single anthrax clone. SGT-1 widely distributed across the epidemic area and present throughout the period in question - may, thus, be the
ancestral form. SGTs 2, 3 and 4 differed from SGT-1 at only one locus, suggesting that they could have evolved
directly from the latter during the course of this epidemic. SGT-5 differed from the other SGTs at 2-3 loci. This
isolate, thus, appears to be more distantly related to SGT-1 and may not be a direct descendant of the lineage
responsible for the majority of cases in this epidemic. These data confirm the importance of molecular typing and
subtyping methods for in-depth epidemiological analyses of anthrax epidemics.

Background
In the region of Basilicata, Southern Italy, anthrax outbreaks are typically isolated, self containing, and involve
unvaccinated herbivores. Epidemics are rare, and often
occur when a rainy spring is followed by a dry summer
[1-5]. During the spring and summer of 2004, as a result
of such weather conditions in the Pollino National Park,
an anthrax epidemic occurred. The affected area
included 13 towns and involved 41 farms over an area
of about 900 Km2, with a livestock population numbering about 7,000 cattle and 33,000 between sheep and
goats. In 40 days, 81 cattle, 15 sheep, nine goats, eleven
horses and eight red deer died (Figure 1). The anthrax
epidemic evolved in three different phases. The first,
counting 26 outbreaks, was the most critical. The

second and third phases, with eight and six outbreaks,
respectively, were less severe.
An additional outbreak preceded the epidemic by
about one month [6]. Several epidemiological factors
may have contributed to this phenomenon. In this, as in
other endemic areas, spores resulting from previous outbreaks may remain in the soil, thus facilitating the
spread of anthrax among livestock through grazing [7,8].
In addition, anthrax infected carcasses are seldom
removed. These carcasses are not isolated from the wild
animals populating the Pollino National Park (deer, wild
boars), resulting in a persistent source of infection in
the environment [2]. Furthermore, the abundance, at
this time of year, of both biting (e.g. tabanid) and non
biting flies, which may act as mechanical vectors, could
also have contributed to the persistence of anthrax
[9-14].

Genetically, B. anthracis is a relatively homogeneous
bacteria species. Not surprisingly, then, discriminating
between strains isolated from epidemiologically linked
outbreaks is not an easy task [15]. Different studies
typed and differentiated B. anthracis isolates using Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) analysis and Multiple Locus VNTR analysis (MLVA) [16-22]. In an
epidemic, however, these methodologies are not likely to
find genetic variation. The Single Nucleotide Repeats
(SNR) analysis described by Stratilo et al. increases the
likelihood of differentiating closely related isolates [23].
Unfortunately, due to the presence of poly-A sequences,
such polymorphisms are difficult to detect both with
electorphoretic fragment analysis and with direct
sequencing.
In this study, a retrospective molecular epidemiological investigation was performed, comparing 25-loci
MLVA and two SNR analyses. We applied the modified
SNR technique described by Kenefic et al. (KEN-MTD)
as well as Stratilo’s original SNR method (STR-MTD),
selecting the four loci with the highest diversity indices
(D = 0.57-0.90; where D = 1-Σ [allele frequency]2)
[23,24]. The SNR primer panels used have two loci in
common (CL33, CL12) and two distinct loci (STRMTD: CL1, CL37) (KEN-MTD: CL10, CL35). Two different genetic analyzers (DNA sequencers) were used to
verify results. This was done to address the technical
difficulty in correct allele assignment.

Results
MLVA 25

The 25-loci MLVA analysis classified all 53 B. anthracis
isolates as belonging to a single genotype within cluster
A1.a, as defined by Lista et al. (Table 1) [17].
SNR analysis

SNR analysis identified five SGTs. Of 53 isolates, 46
were classified as SGT-1, compared to which four isolates, classified as SGT-2, had a single-base pair deletion
corresponding to locus CL33; SGT-3 and SGT-4, each
with a single isolate, exhibited insertions in loci CL33
and CL12, respectively, while SGT-5, again with a single
isolate, differed from SGT-1 at three loci, with a fivebase pair deletion at CL33, an insertion into the CL12
locus, and a deletion at CL10 (Table 1; figure 2).

Discussion
Due to homoplasy, the high mutation rate of SNR loci,
estimated at 10-4 per generation in B. anthracis, does
not allow a correct definition of phylogenetic relationships between different isolates [15]. SNR is, however,
able to detect genetic diversity between closely related
strains as would occur in an epidemic [6]. Our method
of analysis involved the initial use of 25-loci MLVA to
define genetic relationships, and a subsequent investigation of genetic diversity between epidemic strains
through SNR analysis.

the minor subgenotypes are shown along the branches, indicating
the mutated loci and the number of base pairs deleted (-) or
inserted (+).

The 25-loci MLVA assigned all strains to a single
genotype within the cluster A1.a, evidence of their autochthonous origin. This particular genotype is frequently
found in Basilicata. The two SNR analyses, STR-MTD
and KEN-MTD, yielded the same result, identifying five
SGTs. The difference between these methods in terms
of the amplicon sizes obtained for the common loci is a
consequence of the use of different primer pairs. We
found the KEN-MTD more useful, as it allows for a
multiplexed reaction and permits faster and more

reliable detection of fragment sizes, owing to smaller
amplicons sizes. Moreover, the KEN-MTD revealed an
additional difference between SGT-5 and SGT-1, an
allele in the CL10 (Table 1). Polymorphisms were only
discovered among the loci with the highest diversity
indices (CL33, CL12, CL10) [23].
SGT-1, the most common, was distributed across the
epidemic area and present throughout the period
under study. SGT-1 was also detected in soil from a
grave site, and in the feces of wild boar collected in
the same area, suggesting it is the probable ancestral
strain. SGTs 2-4 were rarer (6/53) and not present in
all phases of the epidemic. These SGTs could represent intra epidemic mutational steps descended from
SGT-1. SGT-5, with three loci exhibiting fragment
length polymorphism as compared to SGT-1, was the
first to be isolated in the affected area, but may have
descended from a different, closely related previous
outbreak (Table 2).

Conclusions
The epidemic under study was characterized by a single
anthrax clone. Although the epidemic spread over a large
area, it involved extremely closely related isolates, 86.7%
of which (SGT-1) were identical across the highly discriminating SNR markers. This epidemic was probably exacerbated by the absence of a careful monitoring of
animals, making it possible for spores from a recent victim to spread in the environment. The mutational steps
found in SGT-2, 3 and 4 may be associated with infective
cycles subsequent to the first, while the presence of a
more distantly related strain, SGT-5, testifies to the

The 53 B. anthracis strains are numbered (from 069 to 121) following the Anthrax Reference Institute of Italy coding system. For each outbreak, the date and
phase of the epidemic is reported, as well as the number of animal deaths and their species. The subgenotype and GIS coordinates of the site of sample
collection are indicated for each isolated strain.

evolutionary history of this lineage in this region. This
divergent mutational clone may have originated from different outbreaks in the past. The high throughput genotyping system used in this study proved to be a useful
tool for the study of closely related B. anthracis strains,
and is therefore potentially valuable not only for the
study of epidemics, but also for other contexts requiring
the characterization of closely related strains such as the
study of biological contaminations through environmental isolates or the forensic investigation of bioterrorist
events.

Methods
Bacillus anthracis isolates

In this study, we analyzed 53 B. anthracis strains
associated with a single anthrax epidemic.

DNA preparation

Each B. anthracis strain was streaked onto 5% sheep
blood agar plates and then incubated at + 37°C for 24
hours. After heat inactivation (98°C for 20 min.), microbial DNA was extracted using DNAeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen), following the protocol for Gram
positive bacteria.
25-loci MLVA and SNR analyses

We utilized 5’ fluorescent-labelled oligos, deprotected
and desalted, specifically selected for the VNTRs and for
the SNRs used.
The 25 specific primer pairs for the MLVA were
selected as described by Lista et al. [17]. The eight specific primer pairs for SNR reactions were selected following
Stratilo et al. and Kenefic et al. [23,24] (Table 3).

KEN-MTD

Multiplex I

MLVA PCRs were performed in four multiplex reactions in a final volume of 15 μl. The reaction mixture
contained: 1× PCR reaction buffer (Roche), 1 U of Taq
DNA polymerase (Roche), dNTPs (0.2 mM each), and
appropriate concentrations of each primer as reported in
Table 3. The thermocycling conditions were as follows:
96°C for 3 min; 36 cycles at 95°C for 20 s, at 60°C for
30 s, and at 72°C for 1 min; and finally, 72°C for 10 min.
The KEN-MTD PCR was performed in a multiplex
reaction in a final volume of 25 μl containing 1× AmpliTaq Gold PCR buffer and 0.5 U of AmpliTaq Gold
DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems Inc.), 3,5 mM
MgCl2, dNTPs (0.2 mM each), and appropriate concentrations of forward and reverse primers as reported in
Table 3.
STR-MTD PCRs were performed in four singleplex
reactions in a final volume of 25 μl containing 1×
AmpliTaq Gold PCR buffer and 0.5 U of AmpliTaq
Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems Inc.), 4 mM
MgCl2, dNTPs (0.2 mM each), and appropriate concentrations of forward and reverse primers as reported in
Table 3. The thermocycling conditions were as follows:
95°C for 5 min; 35 cycles at 94°C for 30 s, 60°C for 30 s,
and 72°C for 30 s; and finally, 72°C for 7 min.
Automated genotype analysis

MLVA PCR products were diluted 1:5. Five μl of solution were added to a mix containing 40 μl of Sample
Loading Solution (Beckman Coulter) and 0.5 μl of
MapMarker 1000 size marker (BioVentures Inc.).
Amplicons were separated by electrophoresis on a
CEQ 8000 automated DNA Analysis System (Beckman
Coulter) and sized by CEQ Fragment Analysis System
software.

Amplified SNR PCR products were diluted 1:80 and
subjected to capillary electrophoresis on ABI Prism 3130
genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems) with 0.25 μl of
GeneScan 120 Liz and 500 Liz size standards for KENMTD and STR-MTD amplicons, respectively, and sized
by GeneMapper 4.0 (Applied Biosystems Inc.). DNA
extracted from each sample was tested by two different
laboratories: the Anthrax Reference Institute of Italy,
and the Army Medical and Veterinary Research
Institute.
