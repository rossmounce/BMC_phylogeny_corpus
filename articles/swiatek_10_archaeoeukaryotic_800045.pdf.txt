DISCOVERY NOTES

The archaeo-eukaryotic GINS proteins and the
archaeal primase catalytic subunit PriS share a
common domain
Discovery notes

Agnieszka Swiatek and Stuart A MacNeill*

Abstract
Primase and GINS are essential factors for chromosomal DNA replication in eukaryotic and archaeal cells. Here we
describe a previously undetected relationship between the C-terminal domain of the catalytic subunit (PriS) of archaeal
primase and the B-domains of the archaeo-eukaryotic GINS proteins in the form of a conserved structural domain
comprising a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet adjacent to an α-helix and a two-stranded β-sheet or hairpin. The
presence of a shared domain in archaeal PriS and GINS proteins, the genes for which are often found adjacent on the
chromosome, suggests simple mechanisms for the evolution of these proteins.
Reviewers: This article was reviewed by Zvi Kelman (nominated by Michael Galperin) and Kira Makarova.
Findings
Primases are specialised DNA-dependent RNA polymerase enzymes that function in chromosome replication to synthesise oligoribonucleotide primers for use by
the replicative DNA polymerases [1,2]. Structurally, primases fall into two classes. One class comprises the DnaG
family enzymes found in bacteria and archaea. The second class are the heterodimeric primases of the archaeoeukaryotic primase (AEP) superfamily found in the
eukarya and archaea but which are also present in some
bacteria [3]. The AEP enzymes comprise a catalytic and a
non-catalytic subunit. In the archaea these are designated
PriS and PriL, respectively. In eukaryotes, the dimeric
primase forms part of the replicative DNA polymerase αprimase complex that initiates Okazaki fragment synthesis.
The first structural insights into archaeal primase function came from the crystal structures of the PriS proteins
from the euryarchaeal organisms Pyrococcus furiosus [4]
and P. horikoshii [5]. The latter was co-crystallised with
UTP (uridine-5'-triphosphate) allowing confirmation of
the location of the active site of the enzyme. The P. furiosus and P. horikoshii PriS proteins are composed of two

distinct domains: a mixed α/β domain (the Prim domain)
that includes the catalytic site of the enzyme and a
smaller α-helical domain of unknown function [4,5].
In addition to the Pyrococcus PriS structures, the structure of the PriS protein from the crenarchaeal organism
Sulfolobus solfataricus has also been determined [6].
Three significant differences are apparent when comparing the S. solfataricus PriS structure with those of the
Pyrococcus PriS proteins: the α-helical domain observed
in the latter proteins is reduced to a single irregular helix
in S. solfataricus PriS, the zinc binding motif in S. solfataricus PriS is located at the end of an extended β hairpin
structure that is absent from the Pyrococcus proteins, and
a mixed α/β domain of ~50 amino acids (termed the PriSCTD) is found at the C-terminal end of the S. solfataricus
protein but is also absent from the Pyrococcus proteins
[6]. The PriS-CTD, which is the subject of this report,
comprises a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet adjacent
to an α-helix and a two-stranded antiparallel β-sheet.
Multiple sequence alignments (data not shown) indicate
that the PriS CTD is conserved in all archaeal lineages
with the exception of the Thermococcales (including
Pyrococcus and Thermococcus species) and the Methanobacteriales (Methanosphaera and Methanothermobacter species), implying that these latter groups have
undergone lineage-specific loss of this domain. In addition, the PriS-CTD does not appear to be present in the

eukaryotic primase small subunit proteins. The role of
the PriS-CTD is unclear but it has been suggested that
this may play a role supporting and positioning the
extended β hairpin structure that forms the stem of the
zinc-binding motif [6]. In the Pyrococcus PriS proteins,
which lack the extended β hairpin, a single α-helix
replaces the PriS-CTD [4,5].
The function of the non-catalytic primase subunit is
less clear but experiments suggest that this protein might
have a role in determining (or limiting) the length of the
RNA primer synthesised by the catalytic subunit [7].
Three-dimensional structures for truncated S. solfataricus and P. horikoshii PriL proteins have been determined
and the PriS-PriL subunit interface defined [6,8]. Missing
from both PriL structures is the C-terminal [4Fe-4S] cluster-containing domain that is found conserved in the
eukaryotic non-catalytic primase subunit and which has
been shown to be essential for primer synthesis [9,10].
DNA unwinding during eukaryotic chromosome replication is most likely catalysed by the CMG (Cdc45MCM-GINS) complex comprising the hexameric MCM
DNA helicase and its accessory factors, the Cdc45 protein and GINS [11,12]. Eukaryotic GINS is a heterotetramer consisting of the Sld5, Psf1, Psf2 and Psf3
subunits, each of which comprises two distinct protein
domains [13,14]: an A-domain composed largely of αhelices and a smaller B-domain made up largely of βstrands [15-17]. Intriguingly, the order of the two
domains is circularly permuted in the Sld5 and Psf1 subunits compared to the Psf2 and Psf3 subunits [18,19]. In
Sld5 and Psf1 the A-domain is N-terminal to the Bdomain, whereas in Psf2 and Psf3 it is the B-domain that
is N-terminal. In the complex, the four subunits of GINS
are arranged in two layers and the B-domains appear to
function both to stabilise the interfaces between the layers of the complex and to mediate protein-protein interactions with additional factors [15-17]. The broader
function of GINS within the CMG complex is not known
and although several models have been proposed, significant uncertainty remains over the mode of action of the
MCM helicase itself [13,14]. It has been suggested, for
example, that MCM acts primarily as a double-stranded
DNA translocase, pumping dsDNA through its central
cavity in an ATP-dependent manner; DNA exiting the
central channel might then encounter the GINS protein
acting as a ploughshare to sterically separate the two
DNA strands [20]. Further biochemical analysis of CMG
function will be required to resolve this uncertainty.
All archaeal genomes sequenced to date encode a single
protein with similarity to the eukaryotic Sld5 and Psf1
proteins and their characteristic A-B domain order
[18,19]. A subset of species, including representatives of
the deeply-branching Thaumarchaeota [21] and Korarchaeota [22], encode an additional protein (called

Page 2 of 6

Gins23) with similarity to the eukaryotic Psf2 and Psf3
proteins and their B-A domain order. In S. solfataricus
and P. furiosus, the Gins51 and Gins23 proteins form a
tetrameric complex comprising two molecules of Gins51
and two of Gins23 that is likely to be similar in structure
to eukaryotic GINS [18,23]. The structure of the GINS
complex in those archaea that apparently lack Gins23 is
not known; in particular, it is not known if the Gins51
protein can form tetramers. In evolutionary terms, it is
likely that the last common archaeo-eukaryotic ancestor
encoded proteins with both A-B (Gins51) and B-A
(Gins23) domain order [18,19]. In eukaryotic cells, subsequent duplication of the ancestral genes encoding Gins51
and Gins23 produced Sld5 and Psf1, and Psf2 and Psf3,
respectively, while in the archaea, lineage specific loss of
the gene encoding Gins23 led to the appearance of species lacking this protein [18,19].
In the course of database searching to identify GINS
proteins in diverse archaeal species, we observed that
sequences corresponding to the C-terminal domain
(CTD) of the catalytic subunit of the archaeal primase
protein PriS were often detected when archaeal GINS
proteins were used as the query sequence. For example,
BLAST searching using default parameters [24] against
archaeal proteins in the NCBI Reference Sequence database [25] with the Cenarchaeum symbiosum (strain A)
Gins23 protein [CENSYa_1724; GI: 118576897] as the
query identifies the PriS protein [PAE3036; GI: 1463797]
from Pyrobaculum aerophilum with an E-value 0.003
(amino acids 14-63 of the C. symbiosum Gins23 are 42%
identical to residues 261-310 of P. aerophilum PriS).
Additional Pyrobaculum PriS proteins, from P. calidifontis [Pcal_0991, GI: 4909914]. P. arsenaticum [Pars_1787,
GI:5055591] and P. islandicum [Pisl_0437, GI: 4617745],
are found with E-values of 0.058, 0.063 and 0.22, while
PriS from Thermoproteus neutrophilus [Tneu 1683; GI:
6165219] is found with an E-value of 5.6.
While not providing unambiguous evidence of relatedness, these results prompted us to explore possible relationships between the PriS CTD and the GINS B-domain
in greater detail. Figure 1 shows a multiple sequence
alignment of PriS CTD and GINS B-domains from a representative set of archaeal species, revealing low-level
sequence conservation across the entire CTD and Bdomain regions (see also Additional file 1). To ask
whether this apparent sequence conservation was indicative of structural similarity between the PriS CTD and
GINS B-domains, we compared the three-dimensional
structures of S. solfataricus primase (PDB 1ZT2) [6] with
the human GINS structure (PDB 2E9X) [15-17] using
DaliLite [26,27]. Structural similarities between the PriS
CTD and B-domains of Sld5, Psf2 and Psf3 were readily
identified, with Z-scores of 5.6, 5.5 and 3.4 and rmsd values of 2.6, 2.6 and 1.9 Å for 50, 48 and 38 Cα atoms,

Figure 1 Multiple sequence alignment of archaeal primase CTDs and archaeal and eukaryotic GINS B-domains. The multiple sequence alignment of PriS CTD and archaeal GINS B-domains was generated using Clustal X 2.0 [28,29] with default parameters. Sequences are denoted by their
species names (left) and numeric Genbank Identifiers (GI numbers, right). The positions of the first and last residues of the aligned region of the corresponding protein are indicated. The colouring is based on the consensus shown underneath the alignment. Hydrophobic positions (ACFILMVWYH)
are indicated by the letter h and shaded yellow when present in 80% of the sequences shown; small residues (ACDGNPSTV) are indicated by the letter
s and shaded green. The secondary structure of the CTD of the S. solfataricus PriS protein (PDB code 1TZ2) is shown underneath the alignment (with
H, E and L indicating α-helix, β-strand and loop regions respectively, with α-helices shown in red and β-strands in blue), as are the primary sequences
and secondary structures of the B-domains of three of the four human GINS proteins: Sld5, Psf2 and Psf3 (derived from PDB file 2E9X). The alignment
of the human GINS and S. solfataricus PriS CTD sequences was generated by pairwise structure comparison (1ZT2 versus 2E9X with default parameters)
using DaliLite [27]. The inverted triangles above the Sld5 and Psf3 sequences indicate that amino acids have been omitted at these positions; the number of amino acids omitted is shown.

respectively (Figure 1). As noted above, the PriS CTD
comprises a three-stranded (β1, β4, β5) antiparallel βsheet adjacent to an α-helix and a two-stranded (β2, β3)
antiparallel β-sheet (Figures 1 and 2A). The structural
similarity is most apparent with the Psf2 B-domain,
which also comprises five β-strands and a single α-helix
(Figures 1 and 2B). As with the PriS CTD, strands β1, β4
and β5 interact with the α-helix, while strands β2 and β3
form a hairpin-like structure. The B-domain of Sld5

forms a similar structure, albeit with an extra α-helix
located between β2 and β3 (Figures 1 and 2C), while the
B-domain of Psf3 is more diverged (and partly invisible in
the crystal structure) but the three-stranded β-sheet and
α-helix are still present (Figures 1 and 2D). The structure
of the B-domain of the human Psf1 protein is not known
nor have any of the archaeal GINS proteins been crystallised.

Figure 3 Model for acquisition of the CTD by PriS. Tandem duplication (labelled 1) of a Gins51 ORF found adjacent to a Prim domain ORF
in the last common archaeo-eukaryotic ancestor is followed by deletion (labelled 2) of Gins51 A-domain sequences resulting in fusion of
Prim domain and B-domain sequences and creation of an ORF encoding a recognisable PriS protein in the last common archaeal ancestor.
Subsequent archaeal evolution has seen loss of Gins23 (labelled 3) in
many species and loss of the CTD (labelled 4) from PriS in the Thermococcales, including Pyrococcus and Thermococcus species, and the
Methanobacteriales. Co-localisation and co-expression of ORFs is also
absent in many extant species [13].

Figure 2 Primase CTD and GINS B-domain structures share a common fold. A. Structure of the C-terminal domain (CTD, amino acids
274-329) of the S. solfataricus PriS protein (PDB code 1ZT2, chain A)

The finding that the PriS CTD and GINS B-domains
are related to one another may shed light on the evolution
of these proteins. In many archaeal species, the ORFs
encoding PriS and Gins51 are adjacent to one another on
the chromosome and in certain cases, overlap [13,18,19].
This arrangement is seen in the Korarchaeota, for example, a deeply branching archaeal clade [22]. The close
physical proximity of the PriS and Gins51 ORFs suggests
a simple mechanism for the acquisition of the CTD by
PriS by way of straightforward sequence duplication and
deletion. In the model shown in Figure 3, the last common archaeo-eukaryotic ancestor is proposed to encode
a Prim domain and Gins51 from one pair of adjacent
ORFs and Gins23 and MCM from second pair of adjacent
ORFs (Figure 3). This reflects the physical organisation of

Swiatek and MacNeill Biology Direct 2010, 5:17
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/17

PriS, Gins51, Gins23 and MCM genes in several highlydiverged extant archaeal genomes. Following a tandem
duplication of Gins51 (labelled 1 in Figure 3), deletion of
sequences between the Prim domain and B-domain of
the immediately adjacent Gins51 ORF (labelled 2) results
in formation of a PriS protein complete with CTD as a
Prim-B-domain fusion. The fact that the eukaryotic primase small subunit lacks the CTD may imply that these
duplication and fusion events took place after the divergence of the eukaryotic and archaeal lineages. Thus, the
last common archaeal ancestor encodes PriS adjacent to
Gins51 and Gins23 adjacent to MCM. During subsequent
archaeal evolution, Gins23 has been lost from many lineages (labelled 3 in Figure 3) and the CTD lost from the
Thermococcales and Methanobacteriales, including Pyrococcus species (labelled 4). Co-localisation of the ORFs is
also lost in many extant species [13].
In conclusion, the observations described here highlight a previously undetected relationship between two
key components of the archaeal replication machinery
and suggest a simple mechanism to account for the evolution of the PriS protein.

Reviewers' comments
Reviewer's report 1

Zvi Kelman, University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute (nominated by Michael Galperin, National Center for
Biotechnology Information)
The manuscript by Swiatek and MacNeill describes a
structural comparison between domains of the eukaryotic GINS and the archaeal primase. It was found that
although the domains share limited sequence similarities,
they have similar three-dimensional folds. Using these
observations, the authors proposed several mechanisms
involving gene duplication that could result in the two
protein families. These are interesting observations
regarding essential replication enzymes in archaea and
eukarya. I have only two minor comments. It would be
useful for readers who are not familiar with the archaeal
replication system to briefly describe the dimeric
archaeal primase and the role of each subunit. A sentence
or two regarding the proposed function(s) of the GINS
complex would also be useful (in addition to the references provided).
Authors' response: We are grateful for the reviewer's
suggestions and have modified the text of the manuscript
accordingly.

Reviewer's report 2

Kira Makarova, National Center for Biotechnology Information
Swiatek and MacNeill have made an interesting observation about the similarity of archaeal small primase subunit (PriS) C-terminal domain and B-domain of GINSlike proteins and have presented a plausible evolutionary
scenario showing how the fusion of ancestral PriS and Bdomain of GINS (specifically Gins51) could have
occurred. This paper definitely extends the horizons of
our understanding of complex events in the evolution of
the molecular machinery for DNA replication initiation
in archaea and eukaryotes. Importantly, it also provokes
further discussion and analysis of the proteins and
domains involved in this process. Specifically the absence
of CTD in PriS in Thermococcales and Methanobacteriales and especially eukaryotes raises further questions
about the actual ancestral state and involvement of horizontal transfer in the chain of evolutionary events. In this
respect it would be interesting to see a phylogenetic tree
reconstructed for Prim domain of PriS (of archaea and
eukaryotes). While the evolutionary scenario suggested
in this paper is really tempting because of physical proximity of PriS and Gins51 in some archaea, the ancestral
state of this gene arrangement is not certain, since many
archaea do not have it, including Thaumarchaea, one of
deeply branching groups. Moreover the suggested scenario does not seem to take into account the observation
that the CTD of archaeal PriS is a little bit more similar to
B-domain of Gins23 (this follows from such data reported
in the paper as PSI-BLAST search results and multiple
alignment which shows that only eukaryotic Psf2 has
structure and sequence fully compatible with the CTD
while Sld5 has a specific insertion between β2 and β3).
Hopefully structures of archaeal Gins51 and Gins23
would help to resolve some of these issues. Thus I would
not be surprised if the evolutionary scenario of PriS/
GINS evolution will be revised when new data became
available. And, of course, many questions still remain
about the configuration of the molecular complex that
includes PriS and a variety of GINS proteins or/and CTD.
Authors' response:
The reviewer is correct to state that the organisation of
the genes encoding the PriS and Gins51 proteins in the last
common archaeal ancestor is not certain and to hint that
the lack of physical proximity between these genes in the
deeply-branching Thaumarchaeota might be an indication that the Prim-Gins51 gene organisation proposed in
our model for the acquisition of the CTD by PriS (Figure 3)
is problematic, despite the widespread co-localisation of
these genes in many diverse archaeal species including
representatives of the Euryarchaeota, Korarchaeota and
Crenarchaeota (see Additional file 1). The sequencing of
additional archaeal genomes, particularly from the

Swiatek and MacNeill Biology Direct 2010, 5:17
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/17

deeply-branching clades, will be of great importance in
clarifying this issue.
In addition, while it is true that the findings reported
here could be construed as suggesting a closer relationship
between the PriS CTD and the B-domains of the Gins23
family proteins (Psf2 and Psf3 in eukaryotes), the low levels of sequence similarity displayed by the CTD and Bdomains (Figure 1) and the substantial evolutionary distance between the archaeal and human proteins whose
structures have been solved (Figure 2) do not allow firm
conclusions to be drawn on this point. It also seems
unlikely on the basis of the sequence alignment shown in
Figure 1 that the sequence insertion in the human Sld5
will be present in archaeal Gins51 B-domain. As the
reviewer rightly points out, representative structures of
archaeal Gins51 and Gins23 proteins may well help to
resolve this issue.
