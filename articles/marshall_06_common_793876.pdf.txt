Abstract
Background: There have been indications that common Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs)
may be exerting anti-inflammatory actions by directly modulating the immune system. We decided
to use molecular modelling to rapidly assess which of the potential targets might justify the expense
of detailed laboratory validation. We first studied the VDR nuclear receptor, which is activated by
the secosteroid hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D. This receptor mediates the expression of
regulators as ubiquitous as GnRH (Gonadatrophin hormone releasing hormone) and the
Parathyroid Hormone (PTH). Additionally we examined Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated
Receptor Gamma (PPARgamma), which affects the function of phagocytic cells, and the CCChemokine Receptor, type 2b, (CCR2b), which recruits monocytes to the site of inflammatory
immune challenge.
Results: Telmisartan was predicted to strongly antagonize (Ki≈0.04nmol) the VDR. The ARBs
Olmesartan, Irbesartan and Valsartan (Ki≈10 nmol) are likely to be useful VDR antagonists at typical
in-vivo concentrations. Candesartan (Ki≈30 nmol) and Losartan (Ki≈70 nmol) may also usefully
inhibit the VDR. Telmisartan is a strong modulator of PPARgamma (Ki≈0.3 nmol), while Losartan
(Ki≈3 nmol), Irbesartan (Ki≈6 nmol), Olmesartan and Valsartan (Ki≈12 nmol) also seem likely to
have significant PPAR modulatory activity. Olmesartan andIrbesartan (Ki≈9 nmol) additionally act
as antagonists of a theoretical modelof CCR2b. Initial validation of this CCR2b model was
performed, and a proposed model for the AngiotensinII Type1 receptor (AT2R1) has been
presented.
Conclusion: Molecular modeling has proven valuable to generate testable hypotheses concerning
receptor/ligand binding and is an important tool in drug design. ARBs were designed to act as
antagonists for AT2R1, and it was not surprising to discover their affinity for the structurally similar
CCR2b. However, this study also found evidence that ARBs modulate the activation of two key
nuclear receptors-VDR and PPARgamma. If our simulations are confirmed by experiment, it is
possible that ARBs may become useful as potent anti-inflammatory agents, in addition to their
current indication as cardiovascular drugs.

clinical outcome as ARBs, especially where the patient was
suffering from inflammatory diseases such as diabetes.

Background
Why would ARBs have dose-dependent efficacy?
Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs) act as antagonists
of the AngiotensinII Type1 receptor (AT2R1) [SwissProt:P30556], and were designed to treat moderate hypertension. Although ARBs have been marketed for nearly a
decade, their mode of action is not fully understood, and
debate still rages whether Angiotensin Converting
Enzyme Inhibitors (ACEI) or ARBs are superior at reducing ultimate mortality due to cardiovascular dysfunction.

The reason for this is not immediately obvious, as ACE's
function is to cleave the octapeptide Angiotensin II from
Angiotensin I. The AngiotensinII then binds to AT2R1
receptors on the activated phagocytes, an action inhibited
by the ARBs. Interrupting either pathway, with either ACEI
or ARBs, should have the same effect – the activated
phagocytes will be denied Angiotensin II bound at their
receptors.

An editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine concluded [1]:

Waterhouse, et.al. [9], and Marshall, et.al. [10], noted that
patients with autoimmune disease were anecdotally
reporting that ARBs prescribed for hypertension caused a
noticeable change in their perceived immune disease
symptoms, a change not easily explained in terms of
hypertension, or hypotension, alone. We consequently
decided to investigate whether molecular modelling
could help define precise mechanism(s) of action of the
ARBs upon inflammatory disease. Do they perhaps act as
antagonists for receptors other than AT2R1? Immune system receptors, for example?

"in two recently reported clinical trials in which the investigators were allowed to increase the dose of Losartan gradually to
100 mg per day, there was a significant reduction in the incidence of heart failure among high-risk patients; this finding
raises the important question of whether higher doses of Losartan might have been more effective in reducing the rates of cardiovascular events"
Yet in-vitro studies [2] have shown that the ARBs produce
an efficient and total blockade of the Angiotensin II Type
1 receptor (AT2R1) at doses much lower than this editorial was contemplating. There should be no dose related
effects once a total receptor blockade is place, so the obvious question arises "how can an ARB have dose-dependent efficacy?"

Identifying target nuclear and transmembrane receptors
1. The VDR
The T-helper Type 1 (Th1) immune response is usually
defined as one which generates significant quantities of
the cytokine Interferon-gamma [11]. Many chronic diseases are associated with Th1 inflammation [12], including atherosclerosis [13], diabetes [14], and perhaps even
asthma [15].

It is accepted that diabetic nephropathy is beneficially
affected by ARBs [3-6], yet again the mechanisms, and
optimal dosage, remain elusive. A study using Irbesartan
noted dosage-dependant efficacy, with significantly
greater protection at 300 mg/day versus 150 mg/day [4].

Generation of Interferon-gamma in a Th1 activated macrophage catalyzes its mitochondrial production of the
secosteroid hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D (1,25-D)
by as much as 30-fold [16]. 1,25-D is the active secosteroid of the Vitamin-D metabolism [9]. This steroid's presence is often ignored by clinical medicine, since it
circulates in low concentrations (typically 75 picomoles/
Litre, 29 pg/ml), which are very difficult to measure. Yet

Schieffer, et.al. [7], found that ARBs appeared to exert
stronger systemic anti-inflammatory and anti-aggregatory
effects compared with ACEIs in Atherosclerosis. Luno,
et.al. [8], recently reviewed studies which have shown that
ACE Inhibitors (ACEI) did not always lead to the same

1,25-D and its receptor, the Vitamin-D Receptor (VDR)
[Swiss-Prot:P11473], are expressed in over 30 target tissues, and their expression is tightly coupled with regulators as ubiquitous as GnRH (Gonadatrophin hormone
releasing hormone) [17], and the Parathyroid Hormone(PTH) [18].
Ripple-down effects of VDR activation include changes
not only to the androgens and thyroid hormones, but also
to ACTH, Insulin Receptors, P450C1, and many other biologically important metabolites [18,46].

In patients with severe Th1 immune disease, clinical
observations [9,10] indicated that the administration of
the ARB Olmesartan, at a concentration in excess of that
needed for full AT2R1 antagonism, often causes the level
of circulating 1,25-D to drop.
We therefore decided to target the VDR nuclear receptor
[19] for further study.
2. Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptors (PPARs)
Benson, et.al. reported [20] that the ARB 'Telmisartan'
seems to act both as an agonist and antagonist of Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor gamma (PPARgamma) [Swiss-Prot:P37231], a nuclear hormone
receptor from the same 'NR1' subfamily as VDR. The
PPARs act as anti-inflammatory transcription factors [21].
Part of this anti-inflammatory regulation is mediated
through negative interference between PPARs and nuclear

factors such as NF-kappaB. Ligands of PPAR may affect the
inflammatory response in diseases as wide-ranging as
Inflammatory Bowel Diseases, Atherosclerosis, Parkinson's Disease and Alzheimer's [22]. Clearly, it is important to know exactly how the ARBs might affect
PPARgamma.
3. C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2b)
Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) binding to its
receptor, CCR2b [EMBL:BC095540], plays an important
role in a variety of diseases involving infection, inflammation, and/or injury [23,24]. CCR2b recruits monocytes to
the sites of tissue damage. The monocytes later differentiate to macrophages and/or polymorphonucleated 'giant'
cells.

CCR2b belongs to the same family of 7-Transmembrane
G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) [25] as does
AT2R1, and the similarities between these two GPCRs,
together with the clinical observations [9,10], supported
the addition of CCR2b to this study.

Results
Validation of 'AutoDock' simulation software
It was decided to use automated docking of the ligands so
as to minimize subjective factors which might arise if the
ligands were fitted into the binding pockets manually. The
Scripps' package, AutoDock [26-28], was selected for this
task. Toprakci, et.al. [29], recently compared the Ki values
estimated by AutoDock for ten inhibitors of human
monoamine oxidase-B, with the values of Ki which had
been determined by experiment. In every case, there was
less than one order of magnitude difference between the
experimentally determined Ki, and the value estimated by
computer simulation of the ligand-bound enzyme. Chen,
et.al. [30], also concluded that AutoDock provided accurate estimation of ligand-DNA binding parameters.

We were able to compare calculated Ki for some of our
docking experiments with published values, and similarly
found excellent agreement. For example, we validated our
PPARgamma model by docking the ligand GI262570
(Farglitazar), essentially as predicted by the data of Xu,
et.al. [31].

It is important to understand that the 'Lamarckian genetic
algorithm' used by AutoDock does not guarantee convergence to an optimal solution. The existence of the 'optimal' solution, amongst any set of docking results, only
becomes assured as the number of docking attempts tends
to infinity. Considerable computing power was expended
in order to maximize the likelihood that this study identified the lowest energy docking configurations. Additionally, the algorithm's convergence parameters were
manually adjusted whenever successive docking runs were
not returning consistent minima.
ARBs exhibit a strong affinity for VDR ligand binding
pocket
In order to maximize reliability, two discrete models were
used for the ligand binding pocket of the VDR, extracted
from two separate X-ray generated structures. The first
model was "The crystal structure of the nuclear receptor
for vitamin D bound to its natural ligand" [32]
[PDB:1DB1], while the second was the VDR bound to the
agonist TX522 [33] [PDB:v].

There was no significant difference between the results
obtained from either VDR structure. Table 1 shows the

predicted inhibition constants (Ki), in nanomoles, for
each of the ARBs binding into [PDB:1DB1] and
[PDB:1TXI].
As a further check of model validity, 1,25-D was initially
docked into [PDB:1DB1] with a Ki = 0.03 nmol and into
[PDB:1TXI] with Ki = 0.06 nmol. TX522 was then docked
into [PDB:1DB1] with Ki = 0.07 nmol and [PDB:1TXI]
with Ki = 0.12 nmol. The difference between the crystal
structure of the ligands and the predicted docked conformations was very small (Figure 1), and seems primarily
due to AutoDock's reliance upon grid-based energy calculations.
The ARB 'Telmisartan' had a strong affinity for the VDR,
with Ki≈0.04 nmol into either structure. This value is close
to that achieved by 1,25-D itself, which yielded Ki≈0.03
nmol into [PDB:1DB1] and Ki≈0.09 nmol into
[PDB:1TXI]. Telmisartan docked with a conformation
uncannily similar to 1,25-D (see Figure 2).
Irbesartan and Valsartan gave predicted Ki values in the
10–14 nanomolar region, probably indicating significant

antagonistic action at concentrations safely achievable invivo.
Olmesartan similarly predicted useful Ki values, ranging
from 10 to 34 nmol. Particularly interesting is that two
distinct conformations were identified.
Figure 3 shows that Olmesartan docked in each conformation, one with its imidazole terminus near the triol of
1,25-D. The second focused on the seco terminus of 1,25D.
Losartan docked with a Ki around 70 nanomolar, Candesartan around 30 nanomolar. These are likely also significant antagonists, but higher dosage levels would be
necessary.

Figure 5 is a 2D representation of the 3D structure of Figure 4, created with Ligplot [53,54]. The hydrogen bonds
were identified with HBPLUS [55,56], as were the hydrophobic contacts formed between 1,25-D and the VDR residues. The core structure of the hydrogen-bonded residues
is expanded to a 'ball-and-stick' format so as to show
which atoms are involved in hydrogen bond formation.
A double hydrogen bond was formed from the oxygen of
the triol group of 1,25-D, both to the imidazole nitrogen
of HIS305, and to the imidazole nitrogen of HIS397.
Another hydrogen bond extends from the 1-hydroxyl oxygen to the aminoacetal of ARG274 and the hydroxyl of
SER237, and another pair from the ligand's O3 oxygen to
SER278 and TYR143.
Figure 6 shows that the VDR agonist TX522 [42] also
forms a double hydrogen bond between the oxygen of its
triol group, the imidazole of HIS397, and the imidazole
of HIS305. The 3-hydroxyl-oxygen is hydrogen-bonded to
TYR 143 and SER278, while the 1-hydroxyl-oxygen forms
a hydrogen bond with the aminoacetal of ARG274. No
hydrogen bond is formed with SER237, presumably due

Telmisartan docks with a Ki of 0.04 nmol, so that typical
in-vivo concentrations of the ARB should be sufficient to
displace 1,25-D from the ligand binding domain. Figure 8
shows that that hydrogen bonds are formed to SER237,
ARG274, HIS397 and ILE271, but not to TYR143. SER278
or HIS305. Telmisartan would thus seem likely to act as a
very strong antagonist of the VDR, with an affinity significantly stronger than the other ARBs.
Irbesartan (Figure 9) formed a hydrogen bond between its
tetrazole group and the amino of ARG274. The lack of
hydrogen bonds to TYR143 and SER278 indicate that
Irbesartan will be a VDR antagonist.
Valsartan, although it exhibits a potentially useful affinity
as a VDR antagonist, failed to form hydrogen bonds with
any key residue (Figure 10).
The imidazole of Candesartan formed a bond with the
sulphur of CYS288 (Figure 11), and the imidazole terminus oxygen of Losartan hydrogen-bonded with
SER237(Figure 12). Both are indicative of actions antagonistic to VDR activation.
ARBs exhibit an affinity for PPARgamma
We extracted the coordinate data for PPARgamma from
[PDB:1FM9], an X-ray structure. As model validation, the
PPARgamma agonist GI262570 (Farglitazar) was docked
with Ki≈0.04 nmol, close to the (approx.) 0.01 nmol predicted by the inhibition curve in figure 1A of Xu, et.al.
[31].

Table 1 shows that the ARBs exhibited a strong affinity for
the ligand binding pocket of PPARgamma, with Ki ranging from 0.29 to 61 nanomoles.

to a lowered affinity consequent upon the removal of the
C19 position carbon from 1,25-D(cf.Figure 4).
The Ki = 12E-9 configuration of Olmesartan (Figure 7),
forms a hydrogen bond from its imidazole terminal
hydroxyl to ARG274. Olmesartan forms only hydrophobic contacts with the key VDR binding residues TYR143,
SER237, SER278 and HIS305. TYR143 is especially important. It is part of the 'hinge region,' and key for VDR transcriptional activity [51,57]. It is thus almost certain that
Olmesartan will function as a VDR antagonist.

Telmisartan is the strongest modulator of PPARgamma
(Ki≈0.3 nmol), while Losartan (Ki≈3 nmol), Olmesartan
(Ki≈12 nmol), Irbesartan (Ki≈6 nmol) and Valsartan
(Ki≈12 nmol) also seem likely to have significant PPAR
modulatory activity. Candesartan (Ki≈ 61 nmol) may also
have useful activity at a higher dosage.
ARBs exhibit a strong affinity for CCR2b
The ARBs are designed as antagonists for the Angiotensin
II Type 1 Receptor (AT2R1). This is a GPCR [36] of the
"Class A (Rhodopsin-like) 7-transmembrane receptors."
CCR2b is another Class A GPCR, with surprising similarity to AT2R1.

Table 2 shows the multiple sequence alignment between
AT2R1 and Bovine Rhodopsin [PDB:1L9H], the prototype
structure for Class A GPCRs. Table 3 shows an alignment
for CCR2b vs. Rhodopsin, while Table 4 compares AT2R1
and CCR2b. It is interesting to note that CCR2b and

Figure 15 shows the residues binding TAK779 into the
putative pocket. Hydrophobic interactions with LEU45,
HIS297, ILE300, TYR188, PRO31 and CYS32, help to stabilize the ligand. The 2D LigPlot of residue interactions
can be seen at Figure 16.
Olmesartan and Irbesartan each showed excellent affinity
(Ki≈9 nmol) for this binding pocket, while Valsartan, Telmisartan, Candesartan and Losartan exhibited slightly less
(Kifrom 22 to 40 nmol).
Figure 17 shows the residues which interact with Olmesartan. A hydrogen bond is formed with the imidazole of

model, [PDB:1KP1], which provided a basis for us to
study. We tried to improve upon [PDB:1KP1] by using,
inter alia, Truncated Newton energy minimization with
Ponder's TINKER Tools [38,39] and homology modelling
with Sali's 'Modeller' [40,41]. However, even extensive
homology modelling against the Bovine Rhodopsin X-ray
structure [PDB:1L9H], and other theoretical models, such
as [PDB:1KPX], failed to improve upon [PDB:1KP1].
We accepted that [PDB:1KP1] was probably a valid model
for CCR2b based on the detailed nature of Shi, et.al's studies [37], our failed attempts to improve upon it, and the
manner in which it docked, exactly as predicted, with the
CCR2b antagonist, TAK779.
A binding pocket exists between helices seven and one of
[PDB:1KP1], extending back to extracellular regions one
and three. Baba, et.al. [42] had measured the inhibitory
effects of Tak779 on CCR2b in their laboratory, showing
an experimental Ki≈9 nmol. When we docked TAK779
into our putative binding pocket, it predicted a Ki≈10
nmol, essentially identical with this experimental value.
Figure 13 shows the location of this binding pocket, and
Figure 14 an overview of the pocket structure, running
between GPCR helices seven and one, beneath the extracellular regionone, and bounded at the rear by extracellular region three.

Figure 19 shows the docked position of TAK779 and Olmesartan superimposed, to enable easier comparison of the
final location of each ligand.
Irbesartan forms hydrophobic contacts with a set of residues similar to that of Olmesartan (see Figure 20).
The ARBs, and TAK779, not only fill space within this
binding pocket, but also 'anchor' the top of helices seven
and one to extracellular regions three and one, restraining
the motion of GPCR elements, and, most probably, inhibiting its activation [43].
A putative AT2R1 receptor model
A primary goal set for this study had been the validation
of every structure and tool we used. It had therefore been
decided to ensure that the ARBs would dock into AT2R1
with inhibition constants close to the values measured invitro, as documented in the various FDA New Drug Applications (NDAs). For example, NDA21-286 [2], indicates a
Ki for Olmesartan and Candesartan of approx. 0.1
nanomolar, and for Losartan about 3 times higher.

This validation task proved to be the most difficult of the
study. There was no AT2R1 X-ray structure publicly available, nor any comprehensive theoretical model. Additionally, there was very little comparative experimental ARB
data available (FDA NDA21-286 is the exception to this).
Most authors studied only one commercial ARB product
in isolation.
We tried to use the theoretical model published by Martin, et.al. [43] [PDB:1ZV0] for an activated AT2R1. But no
ARB would bind to that receptor configuration, even after
the extensive energy optimization required to move helix
seven back into its un-activated position.

Discussion
Models provided to ease visualization of nuclear receptors
It is evident from the lack of clarity in Figure 4 that it is
extremely difficult to visualize ligand conformation in the
binding pockets of nuclear receptors using two dimensional media. For this reason we have provided, as an
attached file, an archive of the receptor configurations
used in this study, in addition to the most significant
bound ligand conformations. The models can be loaded
into, for example, the Python Molecular Viewer [35], and
3D analysis performed.

We then decided to produce an AT2R1 model by comparative homology [40] with Bovine Rhodopsin
[PDB:1L9H], but still could not produce a model which
would dock the known ARBs, even after extensive energy
minimization. Eventually we used the putative CCR2b,
[PDB:1KP1] as the comparative model. Surprisingly,
straight out of the 'Modeller' [41], all the ARBs docked
into a pocket on the opposite side of the GPCR from the
binding pocket which had been located on CCR2b. The Ki
for the ARBs ranged from 0.10 to 1.5 nmol, as detailed in
Table 1.
It is interesting to note that although the comparative
homology between AT2R1 and Rhodopsin is only 17%
(Table 2) the AT2R1 sequence is much closer to that of
CCR2b (Table 4). Our failure to produce a usable receptor
by comparative homology with Bovine Rhodopsin would
seem to caste doubt on its utility as a prototype for the
Class A 7-transmembrane GPCR structures.
Figure 21 shows the primary residues involved in docking
the ARBs, and a superimposition of the docked conformations of Olmesartan and Losartan, demonstrating the
homogeneity of location of the imidazole group into the
binding pocket, even amongst ARBs with significant structural differences.
The hydrophobic interactions between Olmesartan and
our AT2R1 is shown in Figure 22. Olmesartan forms two
hydrogen bonds, with GLY194 and LEU197, as does Losartan (Figure 23). Candesartan binds to quite different res-

This archive will also facilitate the testability of our results.
Does telmisartan selectively modulate PPARgamma?
Benson, et.al. [20], presented the ARBs as suited to PPARgamma modulation. Their primary conclusion was that
Telmisartan's structure allowed it to exhibit selective modulation, exhibiting in-vitro PPARgamma agonistic activity
at low concentrations, changing to antagonistic activity at
higher concentrations.

Figure 25 shows the key binding pocket for the agonist
Farglitazar (GI262570) in the PPAR ligand binding
domain. Figure 26, the LigPlot of this conformation,
shows two key hydrogen bonds between Farglitazar's O1,
HIS449 and TYR473, and two more between O2, SER289
and HIS323.
Tsukahara, et.al. [52] recently studied a number of PPAR
agonists. They found that agonistic activity disappears
when TYR473 is mutated, and noted the importance of
HIS323 and HIS449.
Figures 27 and 28 show the residues which contact PPARgamma when Irbesartan and Losartan are docked into
their minimum energy conformations. Although Irbesartan hydrogen-bonds TYR473 and HIS449, Losartan
only contacts these residues, and forms its sole hydrogenbond to ALA278. It would thus seem likely that Losartan
is an effective PPAR antagonist. Irbesartan does not hydrogen-bond to HIS323, a residue found critical to Rosiglitazar's agonism [52], and probably is more likely an
antagonist than agonist.
Figure 29 shows that Telmisartan does not form any
hydrogen bonds with the PPARgamma residues identified
by Tsukahara, et.al., as critical to the agonistic activity of
Rosglitazar. Any molecular mechanism which could result
in 'partial agonism' of PPARgamma by Telmisartan is still
to be elucidated

We would note, however, that the extreme affinity which
Telmisartan exhibits for the ubiquitous VDR might well
alter expression of many hormones at concentrations
lower than those at which Telmisartan begins to modulate
PPARgamma. This may make it very difficult to evaluate
cause and effect in the cascade of metabolic changes
which will result from Telmisartan's blockade of the VDR.
Bovine and guinea pig AT2R1 for FDA in-vitro ARB studies
While modelling the ARBs docking into the AT2R1 receptor, we were struck by data in United States Food and Drug
Administration (US FDA) documents which did not
exactly match our own observations.

For example, there are inconsistencies between our predictions for the relative efficacies of Olmesartan, Candesartan and Losartan; and those of Figure 1.1.1.4 of FDA
NDA21-286 [2]. The NDA's in-vitro experiments, using
Cavia porcellus, showed Olmesartan as having the highest
ARB efficacy, as we did, but found Candesartan close in
efficacy to Olmesartan (1.2×) and Losartan to be less
effective (3.4×). Our study found Losartan (Ki≈0.5 nmol)
to be a better antagonist of AT2R1 than was Candesartan
(Ki≈1.5 nmol).
The answer may well lie in sequence divergence between
the AT2R1 proteins from human, bovine, and guinea pig
sources. The multiple sequence alignment showing differences between AT2R1 from Homo sapiens, Cavia porcellus
and Bos taurus is shown in Table 5.

Our model predicts that the primary residues involved in
docking most of the ARBs are GLN15, GLY194, GLY196,
THR198 and GLY203.
The binding pocket around GLN15 is conserved in all
three homologies.
However, in Bos taurus, the Isoleucine residue 193 is
mutated to Valine. Candesartan has 6 hydrophobic contacts with ILE193, while Losartan and Olmesartan have
only one. It is thus very likely that substitution of ILE193
will differentially effect the degree of Candesartan's antagonism of Bos taurus AT2R1 receptors, when compared
with that of other ARBs, less dependent on contacts with
ILE193.
Additionally, there is a mutation in Leucine 205, structurally adjacent to GLY203. GLY203 has seven hydrophobic
contacts with Olmesartan, eight with Losartan, and six
with Candesartan. In Cavia porcellus, this Glycine is
mutated to Methionine.
The authors consequently believe that the FDA should reexamine the acceptability of Bos taurus and Caviaporcellus
tissues for demonstration of the efficacy of ARBs.
It was beyond the scope of this study to model AT2R1
receptors for all three species used in the FDA in-vitro
data. This should form a topic for ongoing research.

software sources for 'Modeller' and 'Tinker' were recompiled with 64-bit Athlon-class optimizations applied, to
suit the 64-bit CPU. Each server had 1 Gigabyte of memory, and a 160 Gigabyte hard disk. They were networked
(using Samba [50]) to the primary Windows 2000 based
workstation. The workstation also ran AutoDock (using
the Cygwin executables), Python Molecular Viewer [35],
and AutoDock Tools [34].

Conclusion
The FDA-approved prescribing information for Valsartan
states "Valsartan does not bind to or block other hormone
receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation." This is an accurate statement of current knowledge about ARB in-vivo activity.
Yet this study found Valsartan (and the other ARBs) had a
profound affinity for the hormone receptor VDR, for
PPARgamma and for CCR2b. Clearly, if our modelling
data sustains validation in the laboratory, clinical medicine will need to re-examine current concepts of how
ARBs function in-vivo. It is possible that ARBs may
become useful as potent immunomodulatory agents in
addition to their current indication as cardiovascular
drugs. This study has shown how each ARB acts upon several key receptors of the immune system, and should serve
as a solid basis for better understanding the anti-inflammatory properties of this class of pharmaceutical.

Methods
Hardware and molecular tools
Two network servers were configured with Debian Linux.
'AutoDock' [25,26,43,44] was kindly supplied by Scripps'
and 'Modeller' by Salilab [41]. Ponder's 'Tinker' Toolset
was downloaded from the cited location [39]. The Fortran

Optimization of the modelling software parameters
Autodock uses a default grid size of 0.375 Angstroms. This
was changed to 0.2 Angstroms, noticeably improving
upon the Ki calculated with the coarser grid. However, the
computing time with this more precise grid was increased
four-fold. To ensure more reliable minima from AutoDock's Lamarckian genetic algorithm, the 'population
size' parameter "ga_pop_size" was increased from 50 to
100, and the number of energy calculations for each set,
"ga_num_evals," was increased from 250,000 to
1,000,000. One set of AutoDock grid maps was typically
generated for each receptor, and multiple ligands were
docked without changing the grid maps. Docking parameter files were edited using the Linux ASCII text editor.

Energy minimization of structures with Ponder's 'minimize' and 'pss' [38] programs was effected using the
'Amber99' parameter set [47].
Construction of ligand and receptor molecules
Akira Dobashi's 3D Pharmaceutical Structure Database at
Pharmis.org [48] (Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life
Sciences) was the primary source of ARB models. Olmesartan had to be built with Ghemical [49], running on a
Linux server. Receptor coordinates were taken from the
RCSB Protein Databank (PDB), or generated using Modeller [41] (as detailed in the text).
LigPlot and HBPLUS
McDonald's HBPLUS software [56,55] takes, as input, the
computed 3D ligand-receptor complex and produces a
table of hydrogen bonds formed between the ligand and
the receptor. It also produces tables of non-bonding
hydrophobic contacts between the ligand atoms and
receptor residues (default distance parameters were used
for both bonds and contacts). Wallace and Laskowski's
LigPlot software [53,54] takes those tables and creates a
2D representation of the bonds and contacts, iteratively
optimizing the output against a set of user-specified plot
parameters. For example, weight-parameters can be
assigned to minimize areas where the plot of hydrophobic
bonds becomes too dense, forcing LigPlot to iteratively
move the 2D positions of the residues so as to minimize
that clutter, and thus make the output more readable. The
output of Ligplot is PostScript, which was modified with
