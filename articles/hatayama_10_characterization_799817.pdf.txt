Characterization of the tandem CWCH2 sequence
motif: a hallmark of inter-zinc finger interactions
Minoru Hatayama1, Jun Aruga1,2*

Abstract
Background: The C2H2 zinc finger (ZF) domain is widely conserved among eukaryotic proteins. In Zic/Gli/Zap1
C2H2 ZF proteins, the two N-terminal ZFs form a single structural unit by sharing a hydrophobic core. This
structural unit defines a new motif comprised of two tryptophan side chains at the center of the hydrophobic
core. Because each tryptophan residue is located between the two cysteine residues of the C2H2 motif, we have
named this structure the tandem CWCH2 (tCWCH2) motif.
Results: Here, we characterized 587 tCWCH2-containing genes using data derived from public databases. We
categorized genes into 11 classes including Zic/Gli/Glis, Arid2/Rsc9, PacC, Mizf, Aebp2, Zap1/ZafA, Fungl, Zfp106,
Twincl, Clr1, and Fungl-4ZF, based on sequence similarity, domain organization, and functional similarities. tCWCH2
motifs are mostly found in organisms belonging to the Opisthokonta (metazoa, fungi, and choanoflagellates) and
Amoebozoa (amoeba, Dictyostelium discoideum). By comparison, the C2H2 ZF motif is distributed widely among
the eukaryotes. The structure and organization of the tCWCH2 motif, its phylogenetic distribution, and molecular
phylogenetic analysis suggest that prototypical tCWCH2 genes existed in the Opisthokonta ancestor. Within-group
or between-group comparisons of the tCWCH2 amino acid sequence identified three additional sequence features
(site-specific amino acid frequencies, longer linker sequence between two C2H2 ZFs, and frequent extra-sequences
within C2H2 ZF motifs).
Conclusion: These features suggest that the tCWCH2 motif is a specialized motif involved in inter-zinc finger
interactions.

Background
Zinc finger (ZF) domains (ZFDs) are found in a large
number of eukaryotic proteins [1-3]. A single ZF normally forms a globular structure that is stabilized by
binding a zinc ion. Many classes of ZFs have been
described in public databases (Pfam, http://pfam.sanger.
ac.uk/; Prosite, http://au.expasy.org/prosite/; Interpro,
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/; SMART, http://smart.
embl-heidelberg.de/), with Cys-Xn-Cys-Xn-His-Xn-His
(C2H2) being one of the most common. Most C2H2 ZF
proteins contain tandem arrays of the C2H2 motif,
which are located at specific intervals to form a functional domain. ZFDs were originally identified as the
DNA-binding domain of transcription factor IIIA
(TFIIIa) and other transcription factors, but accumulating evidence suggests that ZFDs also bind RNA and

proteins [4-6]. Since ZFDs are essential for many biological processes, their structure-function relationships
have been well studied. For the DNA-binding ZFs, the
structures of ZFD-DNA complexes have been elucidated
for GLI [7], TFIIIA [8], zif268 [9], YY1 [10], and WT1
[11]. These findings have enabled the development of
synthetic ZF proteins as versatile molecular tools [12].
Despite their important and widespread roles, the structural basis of ZFD-protein interactions is less understood than those of ZFD-DNA interactions.
The identification of the critical structural features of
protein-binding ZFDs remains elusive [5] but some
clues are available for a group of ZFs that mediate protein-to-protein interactions [4-6]. Previously, we studied
the intra-molecular protein-to-protein interaction
between two adjacent C2H2 ZFs [13]. The two N-terminal ZFs (ZF1 and ZF2) of human ZIC3, which has a
ZFD composed of five ZFs (ZF1-ZF5), form a single
structural unit through a common hydrophobic core.

This ZF-connecting hydrophobic core is associated with
two tryptophan residues, each of which is located
between the zinc-binding cysteine residues in ZF1 and
ZF2. Mutation of the tryptophan in ZF1 (W255G) perturbs the subcellular localization and function of the
protein, and is associated with a pathological and congenital heart malformation [13,14]. The importance of
these tryptophan residues is further supported by their
conservation among more than 40 Zic proteins identified in a wide range of eumetazoan species [15].
Previous studies have revealed that human GLI1
(PDBID: 2GLI) and yeast Zap1 (PDBID: 1ZW8) also
possess ZFs with two tryptophans in the corresponding
region and that these tryptophans are located in the
hydrophobic core formed by two adjacent ZFs [16].
These data raise the possibility that domains containing
the consensus sequence “Cys-X-Trp-Xn-Cys-Xn-HisXn-His-Xn-Cys-X-Trp-Xn-Cys-Xn-His-Xn-His”, which
we have named the tandem CWCH2 (tCWCH2) motif,
are involved in the interaction between the two adjacent
ZFs. Since our knowledge of the tCWCH2 motif is limited to a small group of proteins, the biological significance of the tCWCH2 structure is unclear.
In the present study, we performed a computer-based
analysis of the tCWCH2 motif using sequence data
derived from public databases. We classified the
tCWCH2-containing sequences into gene classes and
then determined their conservation status in each protein family and their phylogenic distribution. We also
identified sequence features unique to tCWCH2-containing ZFDs. The significance of the tCWCH2 motif is
discussed in terms of its possible structural and functional roles.

Results
Three-dimensional structure of known tCWCH2 motifs

To investigate the positions of the two key tryptophan
residues in different tCWCH2 motifs, we performed a
structural alignment to compare the three-dimensional
(3D) structures of the tCWCH2 motifs from ZIC3
(PDBID: 2RPC), GLI1 (PDBID: 2GLI) and Zap1 (PDBID:
1ZW8) ZFDs (Figure 1A) with that of two C2H2 ZFs.
Our data show that all of these C2H2 ZF motifs form
globular structures composed of two anti-parallel b
sheets and an a helix (bba). The two tryptophan residues between the two zinc-chelating cysteine residues
(Figure 1B) were localized onto the anti-parallel b sheet
where they were juxtaposed to each other. The relative
positions of the two tryptophans were similar among
the three tCWCH2 structures, as was each zinc-chelating residue. The tryptophan side chains were close to
the zinc-chelating histidine in the same ZF, and the
hydrophobic residues in the same and the opposite ZF
(within 5Å, Additional file 1). This result suggested that

the tryptophans play a role in both the stabilization of
their own ZFs and the formation of a hydrophobic core
between the two adjacent ZFs. The conserved positioning of the tCWCH2 motif-forming residue in evolutionarily distant sources led us to investigate its
phylogenetic distribution and structural features.
Database search for tCWCH2-containing sequences

We performed a comprehensive search of tCWCH2
motif-containing genes in current databases. We performed an initial search of the non-redundant NCBI
protein database with PHI-BLAST using the tCWCH2
pattern deduced from the ZIC comparison and human
ZIC3 (NP_003404) as the query sequence. This search
yielded a set of 709 amino acid sequences that were tentatively classified into 11 gene classes according to their
annotations and the pilot phylogenetic tree analyses
(see Methods, Figure 2). For the fine analysis of
the tCWCH2-containing sequences, we performed
TBLASTN and PBLAST searches of the non-redundant
sequence collection of the NCBI database using the
representative sequences of the initial 11 gene classes
and 3 specific genes (two Dictyostelium genes and one
Monosiga gene) as the key sequences. In order to examine the distribution of the tCWCH2 sequence motif in a
phylogenetic tree of eukaryotes, TBLASTN searches
were also performed on a whole-genome shotgun
sequence database of 24 organisms. The sequences
obtained were manually checked to remove any redundant sequences. The final tCWCH2 collection contained
587 sequences that represented the non-redundant
tCWCH2-containing sequences from a wide range of
organisms (Additional file 2). Because the Mizf and
Zap1/ZafA family genes and one Dictyostelium gene
contain two independent tCWCH2 motifs, our collection included a total of 637 independent sequence
regions for tCWCH2.
At this point, we re-evaluated the initial sequence pattern for PHI-BLAST because it was based solely on the
sequence compilation of the Zic family genes. The initial
PHI-BLAST pattern recovered 90% (572/637) of the collected sequences (Additional file 3). Among the 65 nonmatching sequences, 20 sequences showed deviation in
the C, W, and H residues of the tCWCH2 motif and 50
sequences showed derangement of the sequence length
between the two CWCH2 motifs. This mismatch
appeared to be distributed randomly and suggested that
optimization of the PHI-BLAST pattern was unlikely to
be informative. Therefore, we optimized the lengths of
the intervening sequences. PHI-BLAST searches using
the original pattern “xCxWx(2,35)Cx(5,15)Hx(2,5)Hx
(5,25)CxWx(1,3)Cx(5,17)Hx(2,5)Hx” with a tCWCH2
consensus sequence (see Methods) yielded 911
sequences, of which 459 sequences were included in our

non-redundant tCWCH2 collection. This number corresponded to 83% of the tCWCH2 sequences in the NCBI
protein database (total = 551). A looser pattern,
“xCxWx(1,35)Cx(5,15)Hx(2,5)Hx(5,42)CxWx(1,6)Cx
(5,31)Hx(2,5)Hx” yielded 968 sequences that contains
469 tCWCH2 sequences (85% of the total) (Additional
file 3). The sequences identified by the looser pattern
included Zfp407 sequences that contain a pair of
CWCH2 ZFs separated by another two C2H2 ZFs.
These data suggest that decreasing the stringency of the
search (increasing the intervening arbitrary residue
number) impairs the fidelity of the search. Therefore,
we consider that the original PHI-BLAST pattern is
more useful for the tCWCH2 survey.
Classification and domain structure of tCWCH2
sequence-containing proteins

We classified the non-redundant tCWCH2-containing
sequences based on the available flanking amino acid
sequences of the tCWCH2 domain (Figure 2). Each
gene contained one or two tCWCH2 motifs among a
total of 2-9 C2H2 ZF motifs. Proteins containing only
one tCWCH2 domain suggest that a single tCWCH2
constitutes the minimal ZFD component. In the ZFDs

composed of both tCWCH2 and non-tCWCH2 C2H2,
tCWCH2s were always placed at the N-terminal end of
the clustered ZFDs.
The 587 sequences included one fungus/metazoan
common gene family (Arid2/Rsc9), four metazoan gene
families (Zic/Gli/Glis, Mizf, Aebp2, Zfp106), three fungus
gene families (PacC, Zap1/ZafA, Clr1), two social amoeba
genes (named here as DdHp), and one Monosiga gene. In
addition, we identified three novel fungal gene groups
(Tandem-CWCH2-protein C-terminal, Fungus-Gli-like
and Fungus-Gli-like-4ZF). We have summarized the
structural features of each tCWCH2 gene class together
with major gene functions below and in Figure 2.

The proteins encoded by these three gene classes mediate various processes in animal development [17-23].
Their ZFD is commonly composed of five C2H2 ZFs,
and can bind DNA [7,24-26].
Arid2/Rsc9

[27-29]. The ARID (AT-rich interaction domain) and
tCWCH2 domains are conserved in Arid2 and Rsc9
(Additional file 4). Another conserved sequence motif
was found in the C-terminal flanking region of the
tCWCH2 motif. This sequence motif is summarized as
“IxL (S/T) AxL (I/V) L (K/R) N (I/L) × (K/R)” and we
named this motif the LIL domain. PHI-BLAST searches
for LIL domains suggested that this domain was distributed only in the Arid2/Rsc9 proteins (data not shown).

Page 5 of 18

structural features (Figure 2, Additional file 8), we
named this gene family Twincl (Tandem CWCH2 protein C-terminal).
Clr1

The ZFs among members of the Clr1 family [56] were
highly divergent and other sequences were not conserved (Additional file 9, data not shown). Therefore, we
omitted this gene family from the consensus sequence
and phylogenetic tree analyses.

PacC

Fungus-Gli-like-4ZF (Fungl-4ZF)

PacC mediates gene expression regulation by ambient
pH in filamentous fungi and yeasts [30,31]. It contains
an N-terminal DNA binding domain with three ZFs.
Other ZF domains, named A, B, and C, are involved in
responses to pH change [32,33].

This gene group includes annotations from Rhizopus
oryzae and Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis representing
the fungal phyla Mucoromycotina and Chytridiomycota,
respectively. The proteins encoded by the Fungl-4ZF
gene family contain four ZFs that are weakly similar to
those in Gli and Fungl (Additional file 7). Based on the
ZF motif organization, we tentatively grouped them
separately from Fungl. However, based on their
sequence similarity and phylogenetic classification it is
possible that the Fungl-4ZF and Fungl gene groups are
derived from a common ancestral gene [57,58].

Mizf

Mizf was originally reported as a seven ZF-containing
protein [34-36]. We identified two additional C2H2 ZFs
in the gene sequence encoding this protein (ZF2 and
ZF8 in Additional file 5). The two tCWCH2 motifs in
the first four ZFs (ZF1-ZF4) were separated by longer
intervening sequences (>35 aa) than most ZFs.
Aebp2

Mammalian Aebp2 is a DNA binding transcription factor [37]. Its Drosophila homolog, jing, is required for
cellular differentiation [38-42].
Zap1/ZafA

The proteins encoded by Zap1/ZafA should be grouped
together because of the similarity in structure of their ZF
domains (Additional file 6) and similarities in their functional roles in zinc homeostasis [43-49]. Our alignments of
Zap1/ZafA sequences from seven fungal species (Ustilago
maydis, Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus fumigatus,
Magnaporthe grisea, Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Yarrowia lipolytica) reveal significant similarity
in their ZFDs (Additional file 6). The ZFDs contain a maximum of eight C2H2 ZF motifs in which the two N-terminal
ZF pairs (ZF1-ZF2, ZF3-ZF4) can form tCWCH2 motifs.
ZF1-2 and ZF3-4 are separated by longer intervening
sequences than most ZFs. Our alignments showed that
conservation of ZF1, ZF2, and ZF8 was incomplete.
Fungus-Gli-like (Fungl)

The amino acid sequences encoded by this group of
genes have been known as “fungus Gli like”. Here, we
have named these sequences Fungl (Fungus-Gli-like)
(Additional file 7, data not shown).
Zfp106

Zfp106 is a metazoan ZF protein of unknown function
[50,51]. It contains two pairs of ZFs at each end. WD40
repeats (IPR001680, Zfp106) are known to mediate protein-protein interactions [52-55].
Tandem-CWCH2-protein-C-terminal (Twincl)

The sequences are composed of 468 to 1458 amino
acid residues (data not shown). On the basis of these

Dictyostelium discoideum tCWCH2

The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum belongs to
the Amoebozoa supergroup. There are two tCWCH2containing genes in this gene class, DdHp1 (Dictyostelium discoideum hypothetical protein) and DdHp2. The
ZFD alignment of these genes is shown in Additional
file 10.
Monosiga brevicollis tCWCH2

Since Monosiga brevicollis is the only species among the
choanoflagellates in which the genome has been fully
sequenced, the presence of one tCWCH2 sequence
(Additional file 10) may be more functionally meaningful than the singleton sequences in metazoa and fungi.
The existence of an RFX domain (position 376-423)
raised the possibility that the tCWCH2 sequence in
Monosiga brevicollis and Arid2/Rsc9 is derived from a
common ancestral gene.
Unclassified sequences

Six sequences were not classified into the above 13 categories (Additional file 2). Four out of the six unclassified
sequences contained weak similarities to PacC, Fungl,
Fungl-4ZF, and Mizf. The remaining two sequences
from fungi did not show any significant homology to
the other sequences.
Isolated tCWCH2 in metazoan gene families

We found rare occurrences of the tCWCH2 motif in
some metazoan gene families, including three tCWCH2containing sequences in the Sp8 family (n = 37), one in
the TRP2 family (n = 8), one in the Krüppel-like factor
5 family (n = 14), and one in the pbrm-1 family
(n = 21) (Additional file 2). We did not include these
genes in the following analysis because their significance
was not clear.

tCWCH2 sequences in plant databases

Two plant tCWCH2-containing sequences were found.
One sequence (XP_001771543) was the REF6 homolog
of a moss (Bryophyta, Physcomitrella patens) (Additional
file 10). Although REF6 is conserved in many plants, the
CWCH2 was not found in other plant species including
Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, and Vitis vinifera
(Additional file 10). The other sequence, AK110182, was
from Oryza sativa but is highly homologous to PacC.
This sequence was otherwise only detected in fungi and
therefore might represent contamination of Oryza sativa
with fungal material.
In the course of the classification procedure, we
extracted the sequences belonging to each gene family
irrespective of the presence of tCWCH2 motifs identified by BLAST search using representative entire amino
acid sequences. Within this group, we examined the
extent of conservation of the cysteine, tryptophan, and
histidine residues contributing to the tCWCH2 motifs.
The analysis indicated that the tryptophans in CWCH2
motif-constituting residues were generally conserved
(87%-100%) (Table 1).
Similarity among tCWCH2 gene classes

We performed molecular phylogenetic analyses to identify similarities among the tCWCH2 gene classes. For
this purpose, we selected flanking ZFs containing
tCWCH2 (tCWCH2+1ZF) because the tCWCH2 itself
yielded very little information on sequence similarities,
presumably because it is short. In addition, genes widely

The percentages indicate conservation of the tryptophan residues in each

distributed among fungi or metazoa were used for this
analysis because our preliminary analysis suggested that
genes with a narrow phylogenetic distribution (Twincl,
Clr1, Fungl-4ZF, Dictyostelium tCWCH2) had strongly
divergent sequences that may confound the phylogenetic
tree analyses [59]. Using the tCWCH2+1ZF (3ZFs)
amino acid sequences, we constructed phylogenetic
trees by the Bayesian inference (BI), maximal likelihood
(ML), and neighbor joining (NJ) methods. The 89 (80
tCWCH2 + 9 TFIIIA) sequences, representing a wide
phylogenic range, were subjected to this analysis using
the DNA-binding classical C2H2 ZFs of TFIIIA as outgroup sequences (Figure 3; sequence alignment in Additional file 11; detailed tree in BI, ML, NJ in Additional
files 12, 13 and 14).
Each class of tCWCH2-containing genes was strapped
with high bootstrap values in the BI, ML, and NJ methods, supporting the validity of the above classification.
Phylogenetic tree analyses revealed the relationships
among the tCWCH2 gene families and revealed a novel
relationship among the metazoan Zic, Gli, and Glis gene
families. These three gene families were grouped
together, whereas Gli and Glis formed a sub-group in
the branch of the Zic/Gli/Glis group. It is known that
vertebrate Zic, Gli, and Glis are composed of six, three,
and three paralogs, respectively. Interestingly, Glis2 and
Glis3 were separately grouped with their insect homologs (DmGlis2 and DmGlis3 respectively) and sea anemone Nematostella homologs (NveGlis2 and NveGlis3
respectively; Additional files 12, 13 and 14), indicating
that the two paralogs existed in the common ancestors
of cnidarians and bilaterians. On the other hand, vertebrate Zic and Gli paralogs were not grouped with the
invertebrate homologs (Additional files 12, 13 and 14),
suggesting that vertebrate Zic and Gli paralogs were
generated in vertebrate ancestors.
Fungl was determined to have sequence similarity with
the Zic/Gli/Glis group. The Fungl group branch was
always located closest to the Zic/Gli/Glis group in the
BI, ML, and NJ trees, but statistical support was weak
(BI, 93%). The other gene groups with more than two
classes of tCWCH2 motif were not strongly supported
(BI, <70%). However, Zap1/ZafA class and Aebp2 class
proteins were grouped together by the BI and ML methods, and the PacC family was placed in the basal root of
the BI and ML trees beside the other tCWCH2+ZF1
sequences from metazoa and fungi.
Distribution of the tCWCH2 sequences in the
phylogenetic tree

Based on the above analysis, we investigated the phylogeny of the tCWCH2 motif (Figure 3). In global terms,
tCWCH2 sequences were detected in all of the organisms we examined in the Opisthokonta supergroup,

including metazoa, fungi, choanoflagellate (Monosiga
brevicollis) and microsporidia (Encephalitozoon cuniculi).
In the Amoebozoa supergroup, we found two tCWCH2containing genes in the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, but not in Entamoeba histolytica. Apart from
Opisthokonta and Amoebozoa, two sequences were
found in the Plantae databases, but their meaning is not
clear. Thus, it appears that the distribution of the
tCWCH2 sequence motif is essentially limited to the
Uniconta (a collective term for the Opisthokonta and
Amoebozoa supergroups) in current sequence databases.
We examined the distribution of each tCWCH2 motif
class in the phylogenetic tree (Figure 4). Arid2/Rsc9 class
genes were most widely detected in both fungi and metazoa. On the other hand, tCWCH2 was not detected in the
sequences from the order Saccharomycetales (NP_013579,
Saccharomyces cerevisiae; XP_718578, Candida albicans;
XP_506030, Yarrowia lipolytica). Zic/Gli/Glis, Aebp2, and
Mizf were widely distributed in metazoan groups, but
Zfp106 was detected only in Bilateralia except Ecdysozoa.
PacC, Zap1/ZafA, and Fungl class genes were widely distributed among the fungi groups. Distribution of Twincl
class genes was restricted to Aspergillus and its close relatives. Clr1 class sequences were found only in Schizosaccharomyces and Cryptococcus. Fungl-4ZF class genes were
recovered only from the basal fungi (Rhizopus oryzae and
Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis).

Additional sequence features in the tCWCH2 motifs

We generated tCWCH2 consensus sequences for each
gene class as well as for all classes to identify any additional sequence features. The Prosite database
PDOC00028 alignment was used for the reference consensus sequence of general C2H2. The extent of conservation is indicated by the size of letters, and the
consensus sequences are aligned graphically (Figure 5).
Classical C2H2 ZFs are known to have a consensus
sequence of “(F/Y)xCx2CxFx7Lx2Hx4H” [1]. The
tCWCH2 motifs also contain conserved phenylalanine
and leucine residues between the cysteine and histidine
residues. Phenylalanine and leucine are hydrophobic
residues that generally mediate a hydrophobic interaction within a single ZF (data not shown). These data
indicate that the general structure of a single ZF is well
conserved in the tCWCH2 motif (Figure 6A) and that
there are some tCWCH2-specific structures apart from
the conserved tryptophan residues.
Firstly, a position-specific bias to hydrophobic residues
was found in the C-terminal region adjacent to the first
histidine residue in ZF1 and ZF2 (j1, j2 in Figure 5,
6A). Valine, leucine, and isoleucine were frequently
found at j1 position (34.1%, 22.0%, and 35.3%, respectively), and valine, leucine, isoleucine, and methionine
were frequently found at j2 position (14.3%, 14.3%,
39.1%, and 24.2%, respectively) in contrast to those in a

compilation of general C2H2 sequences (PDOC00028)
(valine, 4.2%; leucine, 9.5%; isoleucine, 5.3%; methionine,
7.8%; Figure 6B). The difference in the summed frequency of each position was statistically significant (j1,
P < 1 × 10-100; j2, P < 1 × 10-100 in a c2 test). These
positions were close to the tryptophan residues on the
opposite side of the ZF as determined in the superimposed 3D structures of Zic, Gli, and Zap1 tCWCH2s
(Figure 6A). The biased residue frequency may reflect
the spatial restriction of amino acid choices. Since the
CWCH2 structure suggests the presence of four hydrophobic residues in a compact space, the residue paired
with each tryptophan could not be a residue with a
large side chain, such as phenylalanine or tryptophan.
Secondly, the linker sequence of the two ZFs
in tCWCH2 was significantly longer (11.8 ± 4.4 aa, average ± standard deviation) than those of general
C2H2 sequences (Prosite PDOC00028, 8.1 ± 5.0 aa)
(P < 1 × 10-100, Mann-Whitney U-test, Figure 7). There
were no canonical TGE(K/R)P-like sequences in the
tCWCH2 linker sequences, whereas the TGE(K/R)P linker sequence was found in about 65% of the sequences in
the PDOC00028 alignment. Accordingly, conservation of

the tCWCH2 linker sequences was generally low (Figure 5), and their lengths were more strongly divergent
than those of TGE(K/R)P ZFs (P = 3 × 10-7, F-test). Elongation of the linker was commonly found in the Zap1/
ZafA (ZF1-2, 16.2 ± 5.7 aa), Mizf (ZF1-2, 19.2 ± 4.4 aa;
ZF3-4, 17.5 ± 2.3 aa) and Arid2/Rsc9 (14.0 ± 6.9 aa)
classes.
Thirdly, extra sequences were inserted between the
tryptophan and cysteine residues in tCWCH2. This type
of insertion was limited to the sequences from the first
ZF of Zic/Gli/Glis, Arid2/Rsc9, and Zap1/ZafA and the
second ZF of Arid2/Rsc9 classes. The number of amino
acid residues between the two cysteines of tCWCH2
varied from four to 34 and was mostly four residues in
other classes [15]. This insertion forms an extra looping
structure in ZIC3 (PDBID: 2RPC; Figure 1, 6A) [13].

Discussion
The tCWCH2 motif is a hallmark of inter-zinc finger
interactions

The tCWCH2 motif was originally proposed as an evolutionarily conserved sequence involved in the interaction between ZFs in human ZIC3 [13,15]. The presence

Figure 5 Sequence conservation among the classes of tCWCH2 sequence motifs. Amino acid sequences were aligned and consensus
sequences were generated (see Methods). Mizf ZF1-2, Mizf ZF3-4, and Zap1/ZafA ZF1-2 and ZF3-4 are indicated separately. The PDOC00028
C2H2 consensus is shown at the bottom as a general C2H2 consensus sequence (indicated by the tandem repeat of the consensus sequence).
The short insertion sequences listed below were initially located at the sites indicated by the colored arrowheads in the alignments described
above, but were separated to allow more comprehensive analyses. These sequences represent the longer linker sequences and the insertion of
extra sequences described in the Results section. To achieve this analysis we omitted the four sequences AAWT01013938 (Schmidtea
mediterranea Aebp2), CAG05504 (Tetraodon nigroviridis Gli), XP_001602003 (Nasonia vitripennis Gli), and XP_785526 (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus
Gli) because these sequences contain exceptionally divergent sequences that disrupt the alignments.

of the tCWCH2 motif in the Gli family, Glis family,
Zap1, and PacC has been previously reported [13].
Superimposition analysis revealed a tightly conserved
structure among ZIC3, GLI, and Zap1, supporting the
importance of the tCWCH2 motif in structural terms.
Strong conservation of the tCWCH2 tryptophan residues in each gene class suggests that there has been
strong selective pressure for them during evolution.
Our analysis revealed additional structural features of
tCWCH2 besides the conserved tryptophans, which may
be explained by adaptation of its role in mediating the
inter-ZF interaction (Figure 8). Firstly, there is a preference for valine, leucine, or isoleucine in the j1 and j2
position. This can be regarded as an adaptive adjustment for forming hydrophobic cores of the appropriate
size. Furthermore, hydrophobic interaction between j1
and j2 is likely because they are closely located within
4Å distance in the 3D structure models of ZIC3, GLI
and Zap1 (Additional file 1, data not shown). This also
can influence the amino acid preferences in j1 and j2
position. Secondly, elongation of the linker sequences
may also reflect a structural adaptation to allow the
motif to face the two globular C2H2 units. Linker length
and sequence are important for the function of the
DNA-binding C2H2 ZF, because they determine the distance of each ZF and the linker contacts to the DNA
base [60-62]. However, optimization of the canonical

linker length for DNA-binding may not be enough to
yield opposed positioning of ZF units. The bending
between the two ZFs may be larger than is dictated by
the DNA binding state of the ZFs as revealed in the
GLI-DNA complex structure [7]. Longer linker size
seems to be a general feature of tCWCH2, but conservation of the linker sequences within each class varies
notably. Linker conservation in PacC is particularly
high, despite the widespread distribution of this gene in
fungi, thus suggesting that the linker in PacC is under
evolutionary constraint.
Another structural feature, the addition of extra
sequences, is plausible if we assume the reduction of
structural constraint as a consequence of specialization
in the inter-ZF interaction. For example, the conservation
of tCWCH2-forming ZF1 is lower than that of ZF2-5 in
Zic proteins [15]. In the case of the GLI-DNA complex,
the tCWCH2-forming ZF1 does not directly participate
in DNA binding [12], and the sequence conservation of
Gli family ZF1 is also lower than in ZF2-5 (Figure 5,
unpublished observation). The extra sequences in the
Zic/Gli/Glis, Zap1/ZafA (ZF3-4), and Arid/Rsc9 classes
show poor conservation (Figure 5).
It is unclear if tCWCH2 is the only structure required
for inter-ZF interactions. The C2H2 ZFD is capable of
achieving protein-to-protein interactions in many cases
[6]. Interestingly, in a previous study to design synthetic

the linker sequence between C2H2 motifs in the indicated groups. We defined the linker length as the number of amino acids between the last
histidine of a ZF and the first cysteine of the C-terminally flanking ZF. The PDOC00028 (general C2H2) alignment contained 12326 sequences
and we found 10025 linkers in it. The general C2H2 sequences was further divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of “TGE
(K/R)P”. The sequence numbers of each group: tCWCH2, 614; general C2H2, 10025; “TGE(K/P)”, 4640; “non-TGE(K/R)P”, 5385). Error bar, standard

ZFs utilizing in vitro-evolving protein-to-protein interactions [16], it was found that the hydrophobic residues
in zif268 that interacted between the artificial proteins
and the zif268 C2H2 ZF were similar to those involved
in the GLI inter-ZF interaction. Superimposition
revealed that the position corresponding to the tryptophan in tCWCH2 is occupied by a valine, suggesting
that either intramolecular or intermolecular protein-toprotein interactions, mediated by hydrophobic residues,
are generally utilized for C2H2 ZFs. However, the strong
conservation of the tCWCH2 and accompanying structural features suggest that tCWCH2 is a highly specialized C2H2 ZF for inter-ZF interactions between two
adjacent ZFs.
Evolution of the tCWCH2 motif

We hypothesize that the original tCWCH2 motifs were
generated from classical C2H2 ZFs (Figure 8) that occur
widely in eukaryotic organisms, including Plantae, Excavata, Chromalveolata, and Rhizaria. tCWCH2 motifs
were found in the vicinity of C2H2 ZF in several
tCWCH2 gene classes. It is proposed that the tCWCH2
sequence appeared in the common ancestor of Opisthokonta or Unikonta (Opisthokonta/Amoebozoa). The
acquisition of the tryptophans and additional structural
features of tCWCH2 may have occurred concurrently in
the course of evolution. Whether the evolution of
tCWCH2 occurred once or multiple times during
Opisthokonta/Amoebozoa evolution remains unclear.
However, its short sequence and some isolated distribution in the plant supergroup and metazoan gene families
may favor the multiple-origins hypothesis. Although the
lineage relationship among the tCWCH2 classes remains
unclear, we can presume the presence of the following
tCWCH2 ancestral genes: an Arid2/Rsc9 common
ancestor, which may have existed before the diversification of metazoa and fungi; a Zic/Gli/Glis common
ancestor, an Aebp2 ancestor, and a Mizf ancestor in the
early metazoa; a Fungl ancestor, a PacC ancestor, a
Fungl-4ZF ancestor, and a Zap1/ZafA ancestor in the
early fungi; a Zfp106 ancestor in early bilaterians; a
Twincl ancestor in the founder of Aspergillus and its
close siblings; and a Clr1 ancestor in the founder of
Dikarya, althogh most Dikarya may have lost the gene.
Once the tCWCH2 structures were established, they
may have been more strongly conserved in these classes.
Function and role of tCWCH2

There are several cases that directly indicate the functional importance of the tCWCH2 motif in living organisms. In the case of PacC, mutation of the tryptophan of
tCWCH2 induces a loss of its DNA binding activity
[31,32]. In case of human ZIC3, the tryptophan mutation is proposed to be associated with the occurrence of

Page 12 of 18

a familial congenital heart defect, and biochemical analysis revealed that transcriptional activity and protein stability are decreased in the mutant protein [13,14]. In
yeast Zap1, interaction between the two ZF where the
tCWCH2 motif is located is required for the high-affinity binding of the zinc ion [45]. Also, it has been
shown that the inter-ZF interaction is influenced by the
concentration of zinc ion [46], suggesting that the
tCWCH2 motif is involved in zinc-sensing in yeast.
Apart from the instances referred to above, the functional significance of the tCWCH2 domain remains
unknown. We propose that tCWCH2 may play roles
other than the direct DNA binding that is often exerted
by classical C2H2, because the linker lengths of
tCWCH2 are more highly divergent than those of the
canonical C2H2 ZFs, in which linker length is a critical
parameter for DNA-C2H2 ZF interactions [60-63].
Furthermore, the structure of GLI, ZIC3, and Zap1
tCWCH2 domains, in which the two adjacent ZFs form a
single globular structure [7,13,47], is clearly different
from the structure of the DNA-binding C2H2 ZF domain
where each globular ZF unit wraps around the major
groove of the DNA [7-11,64] (PDBID: GLI, 2GLI; YY1,
1UBD; WT1, 2RPT; Zif268, 1MEY, 1P47; TFIIIA; 1TF3).
In the case of GLI tCWCH2, which is the only tCWCH2
with a known DNA-binding 3D structure, the N-terminal
ZF of GLI1 tCWCH2 does not contact DNA [7].
Assuming that the tCWCH2 domain has a function
other than DNA binding, what roles could tCWCH2
play? Firstly, our domain structure analysis implies that
tCWCH2 likely regulates its neighboring domains, such
as canonical C2H2 ZF, WD40, and LIL. Zic/Gli/Glis,
PacC, Mizf, Aebp2, Zap1/ZafA, Fungl, Clr1, and Fungl4ZF possess canonical ZF(s) in the C-terminal flanking
region of the tCWCH2. In the case of PacC, analyses of
CWCH2 motif-containing tryptophan mutants suggests
that DNA binding mediated by ZF2 and ZF3 may be
influenced by tCWCH2 motifs in ZF1 and ZF2 [32]. It
is possible that tCWCH2 motifs in the other members
of this group act similarly in the regulation of neighboring canonical C2H2 domains. In transcription factors,
DNA binding domains such as the canonical C2H2 ZF,
can define a target sequence and fix the protein position
(angle, distance, direction) with respect to the DNA.
The tCWCH2 motif could provide a ‘hinge’ or modulatory junction that controls the relative positioning of
other functional domains. Secondly, tCWCH2 motifs
may provide a capping structure that isolates the structural influence of N-terminal flanking region. In the
case of ZIC3, mutations in its tCWCH2 motif increase
the random coil contents more than the zinc-free state
[13]. A unique terminal structure in a domain composed
of repeating structural motifs is also seen in other conserved domains [65-67]. In the case of small leucine-rich

Hatayama and Aruga BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:53
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/53

repeats and ankyrin repeats, N-capping structures are
responsible for protein stability [66,67]. Thirdly,
tCWCH2 binding to other molecules is possible, and is
observed for many conserved domains. Transcriptional
regulator and chromatin remodeling proteins form complexes with many different proteins in order to be functionally active [68,69]. Therefore, the tCWCH2 ZF may
not be associated with DNA binding but may serve in
protein recognition similar to many C2H2 ZFs [5].
The distribution and conservation of the tCWCH2
sequence motif in various gene classes suggests that this
motif has important biological roles. The genes we identified containing one or more tCWCH2 motifs are
known to be involved in various biological processes,
including chromatin remodeling (Arid2/Rsc9), zinc
homeostasis (Zap1/ZafA), pH sensing (PacC), cell cycle
regulation, and transcriptional regulation (Zic/Gli/Glis,
PacC, Mizf, Aebp2, Zap1/ZafA). In addition, given that
several gene classes remain to be functionally characterized (including Fungl, Zfp106, Twincl, Clr1, Fungl-4ZF,
Monosiga gene, DdHp), the known functional repertoire
of the tCWCH2 motif is likely to increase. We propose
that the tCWCH2 sequence motif is a widespread and
functional protein structural motif and that further
structural and functional analyses are required to fully
understand its roles in biological processes.

Conclusions
(1) The 3D structure of tCWCH2 is highly conserved
among human ZIC3, human GLI1, and yeast Zap1.
(2) Current databases contained 587 tCWCH2
sequences that can be classified into 11 major gene
classes (Zic/Gli/Glis, Arid2/Rsc9, PacC, Mizf, Aebp2,
Zap1/ZafA, Fungl, Zfp106, Twincl, Clr1, and Fungl-4ZF)
and other minority classes. The tCWCH2 motifs were
found in transcription regulatory factors, chromatin
remodeling factors, and pH/zinc homeostasis regulating
factors.
(3) The tCWCH2 motif is mostly found in Opisthokonta (metazoa, fungi, and choanoflagellates) and
Amoebozoa (amoeba, Dictyostelium discoideum).
(4) The tCWCH2 motif contains three additional structural features: (i) bias to hydrophobic residues in the j1
and j2 positions, (ii) longer linkers between the two C2H2
motifs, and (iii) insertion of extra sequences. The structural features suggest that the tCWCH2 motif is a specialized motif involved in inter-zinc finger interactions.
Methods
Protein structural analysis

Protein structures were obtained from the NCBI
(National Center for Biotechnology Information) database
as PDB format files and we used iMol http://www.pirx.
com/iMol/ and Swiss-PdbViewer http://spdbv.vital-it.ch/

Page 13 of 18

as the PDB viewer applications. The latter was also used
for superimposing multiple protein structures. Magic fit
options were selected for the superimposition of structure
data because the number of amino acid residues was different between proteins. Zif268 (PDBID: 1P47) and
TFIIIA (PDBID: 2J7J) were used for the reference structure of the classical C2H2 ZF. For the distance analysis of
the neighboring amino acid residues, we used “Neighbors
of Selected Residue Side chain” option of the SwissPdbViewer. The software showed the list of the neighboring residues with distances. We dealt with the residues if
the same residues were detected as the neighbors in
more than 10 models of ZIC3 and Zap1 PDB files that
include 20 models respectively.
Database search

We conducted web-based BLAST searches using Pattern
Hit Initiated (PHI)-BLAST of NCBI databases http://blast.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi. For the sequence pattern of the
PHI-BLAST searches, we used “xCxWx(2,35)Cx(5,15)Hx
(2,5)Hx(5,25)CxWx(1,3)Cx(5,17)Hx(2,5)Hx”. The initial
sequence pattern was deduced from the compilation of
the Zic family sequences [15,70] and subsequently the
intervening sequence lengths were modified to the above
pattern until no additional sequences appeared in the
search. The seed sequences obtained by PHI-BLAST
search were first classified into gene families based on
their annotation and on phylogenetic tree analyses
(see below). Then a TBLASTN search was performed
against (1) all of the following databases: GenBank+RefSeq
Nucleotides+EMBL+DDBJ+PDB excluding whole-genome
shotgun sequences and expressed sequence tags (nr option
in the NCBI, TBLASTN search), and (2) whole genome
shotgun sequences of the organisms shown in Table 2.
The whole genome sequence TBLASTN search was performed using representative sequences for each gene
family (Table 3) initially on a eukaryote-wide basis, and
then on a metazoa-and-fungus-wide basis. For the metazoa-and-fungus-wide search, sequences closely related to
the selected genes were searched in the following genespecies combinations: Arid2/Rsc9, PacC, Zap1/ZafA,
Fungl, Twincl, Clr1, and Fungl-4ZF were searched in
fungi; and Zic/Gli/Glis, Arid2/Rsc9, Mizf, Aebp2, and
Zfp106 were searched in metazoa. The target organisms
are listed in Table 2. These organisms were selected on
the basis of the following criteria: (1) high genome
sequence coverage (>5×), (2) member of a major Eukaryote taxon or considered to be in a phylogenetically
important position. The collected sequences were manually checked for the presence of the sequence of the
tCWCH2 motif. In addition, we performed protein
BLAST searches using representative sequences for 16
gene families (Aebp2, Arid2, Clr1, Csr1, Fungl, Fungl-4ZF,
Gli, Glis, Mizf, PacC, Rsc9, Twincl, ZafA, Zap1, Zfp106,

These searches revealed the extent of tCWCH2 motif conservation in each gene family. Redundant sequences
derived from a single gene in a single species were
removed from the collected sequences except for one
representative sequence. We obtained 587 non-redundant
sequences containing the tCWCH2 sequence motif.
For the re-evaluation of the initial PHI-BLAST pattern, we generated a tCWCH2 consensus sequence
of “LVCKWDGCSEKLFDSPEELVDHVCEDHVGTQLEYTCLWKGCDRFPFKSRYKLIRHIRSHTGEKP”. This

Sequence analysis

Amino acid sequences of the tCWCH2 motif and one
C2H2 ZF in the carboxy flanking were aligned using
ClustalX software [71] with default parameter settings.
The final adjustment of the alignment was performed
manually. For the phylogenic tree analyses, MEGA4
{Neighbor-Joining tree (NJ, JTT model, alpha value was
determined by Tree-Puzzle [72]), http://www.megasoftware.net/, [73,74]}, RAxML {Maximal Likelihood (ML,
WAG model) tree, http://phylobench.vital-it.ch/raxmlbb/, [75]}, and MrBayes3.1.2 {Bayesian Inference (BI,
WAG model) tree, [76]} were used. To generate the
consensus sequence figure, the aligned sequence was
subjected to a web-based analysis, WebLogo http://
weblogo.berkeley.edu/[77]. The PDOC00028 alignment
in the Prosite database (12328 sequences, http://au.
expasy.org/prosite/) was used for the reference sequence
representing the general C2H2 domain. This alignment
was entered directly into WebLogo and subjected to linker length analysis. We aligned all of the sequences and
then extracted the alignment of each taxon to generate
the hierarchically ordered alignment of the consensus
sequences. The linker sequence length between the two
C2H2 ZF motifs was defined by the number of amino
acid residues between the C-terminal histidine residue
of the first ZF and the N-terminal cysteine residue of
the second ZF.
The PDOC00028 sequence alignment contains the
gene name and species together with the start and end
position number (e.g., GLI1_HUMAN/301-330). We calculated the linker length by subtracting the end-position
number from the start-position number for two ZFs.
We excluded linker lengths that were too long
(>41), because the average length of general C2H2
sequences (PDOC00028) was 27.95 (n = 12328, standard
deviation = 1.39, max. = 42, min. = 10) and the maximum linker length of tCWCH2 was 37.
