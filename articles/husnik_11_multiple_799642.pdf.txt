Multiple origins of endosymbiosis within the
Enterobacteriaceae (g-Proteobacteria):
convergence of complex phylogenetic
approaches

Abstract
Background: The bacterial family Enterobacteriaceae gave rise to a variety of symbiotic forms, from the loosely
associated commensals, often designated as secondary (S) symbionts, to obligate mutualists, called primary (P)
symbionts. Determination of the evolutionary processes behind this phenomenon has long been hampered by the
unreliability of phylogenetic reconstructions within this group of bacteria. The main reasons have been the
absence of sufficient data, the highly derived nature of the symbiont genomes and lack of appropriate
phylogenetic methods. Due to the extremely aberrant nature of their DNA, the symbiotic lineages within
Enterobacteriaceae form long branches and tend to cluster as a monophyletic group. This state of phylogenetic
uncertainty is now improving with an increasing number of complete bacterial genomes and development of new
methods. In this study, we address the monophyly versus polyphyly of enterobacterial symbionts by exploring a
multigene matrix within a complex phylogenetic framework.
Results: We assembled the richest taxon sampling of Enterobacteriaceae to date (50 taxa, 69 orthologous genes
with no missing data) and analyzed both nucleic and amino acid data sets using several probabilistic methods. We
particularly focused on the long-branch attraction-reducing methods, such as a nucleotide and amino acid data
recoding and exclusion (including our new approach and slow-fast analysis), taxa exclusion and usage of complex
evolutionary models, such as nonhomogeneous model and models accounting for site-specific features of protein
evolution (CAT and CAT+GTR). Our data strongly suggest independent origins of four symbiotic clusters; the first is
formed by Hamiltonella and Regiella (S-symbionts) placed as a sister clade to Yersinia, the second comprises
Arsenophonus and Riesia (S- and P-symbionts) as a sister clade to Proteus, the third Sodalis, Baumannia, Blochmannia
and Wigglesworthia (S- and P-symbionts) as a sister or paraphyletic clade to the Pectobacterium and Dickeya clade
and, finally, Buchnera species and Ishikawaella (P-symbionts) clustering with the Erwinia and Pantoea clade.
Conclusions: The results of this study confirm the efficiency of several artifact-reducing methods and strongly
point towards the polyphyly of P-symbionts within Enterobacteriaceae. Interestingly, the model species of
symbiotic bacteria research, Buchnera and Wigglesworthia, originated from closely related, but different, ancestors.
The possible origins of intracellular symbiotic bacteria from gut-associated or pathogenic bacteria are suggested, as
well as the role of facultative secondary symbionts as a source of bacteria that can gradually become obligate
maternally transferred symbionts.

Background
One of the most fundamental evolutionary questions
concerning insect-bacteria symbiosis is the origin and
phylogenetic relationships of various symbiotic lineages.
This knowledge is necessary for understanding the
dynamics and mechanisms of symbiosis establishment
and maintenance within the host. For instance, close
relationships between symbionts and pathogenic bacteria
suggests a transition from pathogenicity to symbiosis;
polyphyly of the symbionts within a single host group is
evidence of their multiple independent origins and close
relationships among symbionts of different biology indicate high ecological flexibility within a given symbiotic
group [1-6]. These implications are particularly important within Enterobacteriaceae, the group containing a
broad spectrum of symbiotic lineages and forms
described from various groups of insects. Their biology
varies from loosely associated facultative symbionts
(often called Secondary (S) symbionts) to obligatory
mutualists of a highly derived nature, called Primary (P)
symbionts [7-9]. However, the concept of the P- and Ssymbionts and the associated terminology are a major
oversimplification and they become inadequate for the
description of the ever increasing complexity of the
symbiotic system within Enterobacteriaceae. This complexity is manifested by such phenomena as the presence of multiple symbionts in a single host [10],
occurrence of intermediate symbiotic forms and the
replacement of symbionts within a host [11-14] or close
phylogenetic relationships between typical S- and Psymbionts revealing their high ecological versatility [15].
A good example of such a complex system is provided
by the occurrence of multiple obligate symbionts within
Auchenorrhyncha [10], universally harboring Sulcia
muelleri (Bacteroidetes) [16] with either Hodgkinia cicadicola (a-Proteobacteria) in cicadas, Zinderia insecticola
(b-Proteobacteria) in spittlebugs or Baumannia cicadellinicola (g-Proteobacteria) in sharpshooters. All of these
latter symbionts are obligate and have been cospeciating
with their hosts for millions of years [17-21]. A close
phylogenetic relationship between typical S- and P-symbionts has been so far demonstrated in two well defined
and often studied groups, the enterobacterial genera
Arsenophonus and Sodalis [5,22,23]. The general capability of S-symbionts to supplement the metabolic
functions of P-symbionts or even replace them was
demonstrated experimentally by replacement of Buchnera with Serratia in aphids [24].
It is obvious that all these fascinating processes can
only be studied on a reliable phylogenetic background
[9,25-28]. Unfortunately, under current conditions, the
phylogeny within Enterobacteriaceae and the placement
of various symbiotic lineages are very unstable.

Particularly, the P-symbionts present an extremely difficult challenge to phylogenetic computation due to their
strongly modified genomes [9]. There are several root
problems that are responsible for this dissatisfactory
state. Traditionally, 16S rDNA was frequently used as
an exclusive molecular marker for the description of a
new symbiont. Many lineages are thus represented only
by this gene, which has been shown within Enterobacteriaceae to be inadequate for inferring a reliable phylogeny [29]. In addition, it is notoriously known that the
phylogenetic information of symbiotic bacteria is often
seriously distorted due to the conditions associated with
the symbiotic lifestyle. The effect of strong bottlenecks
accompanied by reduced purifying selection and the
overall degeneration of symbiotic genomes have been
thoroughly discussed in many studies [30-33]. As a
result of these degenerative processes, symbiotic lineages
may experience parallel changes of their DNAs and
these convergences produce the main source of phylogenetic artifacts. Among the most important features are
biased nucleotide composition favoring adenine-thymine
bases and rapid sequence evolution. While the compositional bias leads to the introduction of homoplasies at
both nucleotide and amino acid levels, the accelerated
evolution is a well known source of the long-branch
attraction phenomenon [34,35]. Due to these circumstances, symbionts almost always appear as long
branches in phylogenetic trees and tend to cluster
together [36].
Various methodological approaches have been tested
to overcome these difficulties (Additional file 1). They
are based mainly on the concatenation of a large number of genes through the whole genome [37-39], the
supertree and the consensus approach [37], exclusion of
amino acids (FYMINK: phenylalanine, tyrosine, methionine, isoleucine, asparagine and lysine) most affected by
nucleotide bias [37], modifications of sequence evolution
models [11,12,36,40] and use of the genome structure as
a source of phylogenetic data [41]. Phylogenomic studies
based on large concatenated sets frequently imply
monophyly of the typical P-symbionts (Additional file
1). However, due to the limited number of available
genomes, these studies are usually based on inadequate
taxon sampling. For example, secondary symbionts and
plant pathogens that were shown to break the P-symbiont monophyly in the analysis using a nonhomogeneous model [40] could not be included into these
phylogenomic studies. It is important to note that Psymbionts are probably only distantly related to the
Escherichia/Salmonella/Yersinia clade. Therefore, the
monophyly of P-symbionts derived from such a phylogenomic dataset is logically inevitable, but does not carry
any evolutionary information.

The non-monophyletic nature of P-symbionts has
been recently suggested in several studies. Perhaps the
most inspiring is a study based on a nonhomogeneous
model that separates P-symbionts into two independent
lineages [40]. As an alternative, a paraphyletic arrangement of these symbionts in respect to several free-living
taxa has been revealed from gene-order analysis based
on break-point and inversion distances [41]. Most
recently, Williams et al. [42] performed a ‘telescoping’
multiprotein phylogenomic analysis of 104 g-Proteobacterial genomes. The phylogeny of Enterobacteriaceae
endosymbionts was difficult to resolve, although it
appeared that there were independent origins of at least
the Sodalis and Buchnera lineages.
Thus, there is now a spectrum of hypotheses on the
phylogeny of insect symbionts, ranging from complete
polyphyly with multiple independent origins to complete
monophyly with one common origin. In this study, we
take advantage of current progress in computational
methods to investigate phylogenetic relationships among
the symbiotic lineages. One of the promising recent
methodological advances is the introduction of a site-heterogeneous non-parametric mixture CAT model that
allows for site-specific features of protein evolution [43].
This model was shown to solve the long-branch attraction (LBA) artifacts and outperform the previous models

Page 3 of 17

[44-47]. Similarly, the slow-fast method based on removal
of the fastest evolving sites was shown to reduce phylogenetic artifacts [48-54], as well as purine/pyrimidine (RY)
data recoding [55-58] or amino acid data recoding
[59,60]. We used these methods as the core of a complex
approach and tried to investigate series of methods, models and parameters to detect common trends in changes
of the topologies. To do this, we applied two parallel
approaches, one based on the application of recently
developed algorithms and the other on the removal or
recoding of the positions most affected by rapid sequence
evolution and/or compositional (AT) bias. In addition,
we paid particular attention to the sampling and used as
much of a complete set of both symbiotic and free-living
lineages as possible. This approach is particularly important to avoid interpretation uncertainties due to the
absence of phylogenetically important lineages.

Standard maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference

The single gene maximum likelihood (ML) analyses of
both nucleic and amino acid data provided an array of
mutually exclusive topologies. The majority consensus
based on amino acid data (Additional file 2a) groups
almost all symbionts into polytomy with only two pairs
of sister symbiotic species being resolved (Buchnera and
Blochmannia). Phylogenetic trees inferred by ML and
Bayesian inference (BI) from the nucleic acid concatenated data using the General Time Reversible model
with an estimated proportion of invariable sites (I) and
heterogeneity of evolutionary rates modeled by the four
substitution rate categories of the gamma (Γ) distribution with the gamma shape parameter (alpha) estimated
from the data (GTR+I+Γ) were apparently affected by
phylogenetic artifacts, as demonstrated by placement of
Riesia and Wigglesworthia within the Buchnera cluster
with high posterior probabilities in the BI tree (Figure 2)
and the attraction of two outgroup species (Haemophilus and Pasteurella) in the ML tree with high bootstrap
support (Additional file 2b). Similar topologies were also
retrieved from the amino acid concatenate by ML and
BI using the LG+I+Γ, WAG+I+Γ and GTR+I+Γ models
(Figure 3). Nevertheless, in contrast to the nucleotidederived results, the monophyly of the Buchnera clade
was not disrupted and Hamiltonella and Regiella were
unambiguously separated from the other symbionts and
clustered with Yersinia.
PhyloBayes, non-homogenous PhyML and modified
matrices

The phylogenetic trees acquired under the CAT+GTR
PhyloBayes model from 14 and 55 concatenated genes
(Figure 4 and Additional file 2p) split symbiotic bacteria
into four and three independent lineages, respectively.
First, Arsenophonus nasoniae is a sister species to Proteus mirabilis; second, Hamiltonella and Regiella form a
sister clade to Yersinia pestis; third, the Sodalis, Baumannia, Blochmannia, Wigglesworthia, Riesia and Buchnera clade form a sister clade to Dickeya/
Pectobacterium. The position of Ishikawaella differs
between the two datasets. In the 14-gene dataset, Ishikawaella forms a sister clade to Pantoea (Figure 4) and in
the 55-gene dataset, it is attracted to the P-symbiont
cluster (Additional file 2p).
A topology with four independent symbiotic clades
resulted from the trees derived from dayhoff6 and dayhoff4 recoded amino acid data sets analyzed by CAT and
CAT+GTR models (Figure 5, Additional file 2r, q) and
partially with the hp (hydrophobic-polar) recoded dataset (Additional file 2c) - which was on the other hand
affected by the substantial loss of phylogenetic information. The first clade is Buchnera+Ishikawaella as a sister
clade to the Erwinia/Pantoea clade, the second clade is

Page 4 of 17

Riesia+Arsenophonus as a sister clade to Proteus, the
third clade is Hamiltonella+Regiella as a sister clade to
Yersinia, and the last clade is composed of Sodalis, Baumannia, Blochmannia and Wigglesworthia.
The analyses testing each symbiont independently,
using a CAT+GTR model on the dayhoff6 recoded
datasets, resulted in topologies supporting multiple origins of endosymbiosis (Additional file 2s). Arsenophonus clusters with Proteus; Hamiltonella clusters with
Yersinia; Regiella clusters with Yersinia; and Sodalis,
Blochmannia, Baumannia, Riesia and Wigglesworthia
grouped into polytomy with the basal enterobacterial
clades. Most importantly, the Buchnera clade clusters
as a sister clade to the Erwinia clade and Ishikawaella
is placed in polytomy with the Pantoea and Erwinia
clade.
The non-homogenous (nh) PhyML nucleotide analyses
with two different starting trees resulted in two different
topologies (Figure 6 and Additional file 2d, e, f). When
compared by the approximately unbiased (AU) test, the
topology with four independent origins of symbiotic
bacteria prevailed (P = 1) over the topology with monophyly of P-symbionts, which therefore corresponds to a
local minimum due to a tree search failure (complete
matrix: P = 2 × 10-67; matrix without the third positions:
P = 9 × 10 -87 ). The only incongruence in topologies
based on the complete matrix (Additional file 2d) and
the matrix without the third positions (Figure 6) was the
placement of the Sodalis+Baumannia+Blochmannia
+Wigglesworthia clade as a sister clade to the Edwardsiella or Dickeya/Pectobacterium clades.
Matrices obtained by removing positions according to
the AT/GC contents produced trees covering the whole
continuum illustrated in Figure 1. The most severe
restrictions, that is, removal of all positions that contain
both AT and GC categories or relaxing for up to three
taxa (see BI trees in Additional file 2g, h, i, j), yielded
topologies compatible with the results of the CAT
model applied on the recoded amino acid data and of
the nhPhyML analysis. Further relaxing the restriction
rule led to a variety of trees along the Figure 1 continuum, with a less clear relation between the used parameter and the resulting topology (Additional file 3).
Compared to the ML analysis of all nucleotide positions, the analysis of first plus second positions reduced
the obvious artifact of outgroup attraction (Additional
file 2k). Nevertheless, it also sorted symbionts according
to their branch length. Analysis of the RY recoded
nucleotide matrix produced a tree compatible with the
results of the CAT+GTR model (Additional file 2l).
Analysis of the RY recoded nucleotide matrix without
the third positions resulted in a topology with a Sodalis
+Baumannia+Blochmannia cluster (as a sister to the
Pectobacterium/Dickeya clade) separated from the rest

with gradual reduction of saturated positions did not
produce the polyphyly of P-symbionts (Additional file 3;
only the first five trees presented, subsequent trees are

identical to the fifth tree). However, this analysis shows
an increasing effect of LBA artifacts associated with the
increasing number of remaining saturated positions,
especially Riesia attraction and swapping of symbiotic
branches according to their length.

Discussion
Performance of the methods: convergence towards nonmonophyly

The results obtained in this study strongly indicate that
the frequently retrieved monophyly of P-symbionts is an
artifact caused by their highly modified genomes. None
of the most widely used methods, that is, ML and BI
with different models used on nucleic (GTR+I+Γ) and
amino acid (GTR/LG/WAG+I+Γ) data, were capable of
resolving deep phylogenetic relationships and correct
placement of the symbiotic taxa. This conclusion is evidenced by obvious artifacts, such as the inclusion of Riesia into the P-symbiotic lineage or the even more
conspicuous distorted placing of Wigglesworthia within
the Buchnera cluster. The arrangement of such trees
suggests that these methods sort the symbionts according to their branch lengths and/or AT contents and
attach the whole symbiotic cluster to the longest branch
available. While the difficulty with placement of the
most aberrant taxa, such as Riesia, Wigglesworthia and
Buchnera (Cinara cedri) was also observed when using
the mixture model accounting for site specific characteristics of protein evolution (Figure 4; Additional files 2p
and 5), these artifacts disappeared after amino acid data
recoding followed by CAT and CAT+GTR model analysis and the application of a nonhomogeneous model.
Additional support for the non-monophyly view stems
from the second, parallel approach based on the
restricted matrices. While our newly developed method
shares the basic principles with the slow-fast and recoding methods, such as the removal of the positions that
are likely to distort the phylogenetic relationships due to
their aberrant evolution, it differs in the criteria of their
removal and thus produces different input data. It is
therefore significant that this method led independently
to the same picture, the non-monophyly of the P-symbionts with clustering identical to the above analyses:
Ishikawaella+Buchnera and Sodalis+Baumannia+Blochmannia+Wigglesworthia. The removal of the heteropecillous sites was recently shown to have similar
effectiveness as our new method [61], which further
supports the results. Moreover, this topology was
obtained even under the maximum parsimony (MP) criterion (Additional file 3), which is known to be extremely sensitive to LBA [34]. On the other hand, although
slow-fast analysis is generally considered a powerful tool
for resolving relationships among taxa with different
rates of evolution, we show in our data that the mere
exclusion of the fast evolving sites is not sufficient when
using empirical models and should be followed by analysis using some of the complex models, such as the
CAT-like models. In addition, since this method usually
requires an a priori definition of monophyletic groups,

Page 10 of 17

it should be used and interpreted with caution. Similar
to the slow-fast method, RY recoding and exclusion of
third codon positions were not sufficient for resolving
deep symbiont phylogeny. However, all these methods
can remove at least some of the artifacts and provide
insight for further analyses.
Summarizing the topologies obtained in this study
(Figure 1), a convergence can be detected towards a particular non-monophyletic arrangement of P-symbionts,
as revealed under the most ‘derived’ methods. This
result strongly supports the view of multiple origins of
insect endosymbionts, as first revealed by the nonhomogeneous model of sequence evolution [40], and is partially congruent with the analyses of gene order [41] and
phylogenomics of Gammaproteobacteria [42]. It is also
important to note that, apart from multiple symbiont
clustering, the arrangement of the non-symbiotic taxa
corresponds to most of the phylogenomic analyses using
Escherichia/Salmonella/Yersinia taxon sampling [37-39].
Biological significance of P-symbionts non-monophyly

Considering that most of the ‘artifact-resistant’ analyses
point towards the non-monophyly of enterobacterial Psymbionts, the questions of how many symbiotic
lineages are represented by the known symbiotic diversity and what are their closest free-living relatives now
becomes of particular importance. It is not clear
whether the split of the original P-symbiotic cluster into
two lineages is definite or these two groups will be
further divided after yet more sensitive methods and
more complete data are available. At the moment there
are still several clusters composed exclusively of derived
symbiotic forms. In principle, three different processes
may be responsible for the occurrence of such clusters:
first, horizontal transmission of established symbiotic
forms among host species; second, inadequate sampling
with missing free-living relatives; or third, phylogenetic
artifacts. All of these factors are likely to play a role in
the current topological patterns. Being the main issues
of this study, the role of methodological artifacts has
been discussed above. Horizontal transmission, as the
basis of non-artificial symbiotic clusters, is likely to take
part at least in some cases. Perhaps the most convincing
example is the Wolbachia cluster [62]: while within
Enterobacteriaceae it may apply to Arsenophonus, Sodalis and possibly some other S-symbionts.
Recognition of the third cause, the incomplete sampling, and identification of the closest free-living relatives, now becomes a crucial step in future research. It
is often assumed that symbionts originate from bacteria
common to the environment typical for a given insect
group. For example, cicadas spend most of their life
cycle underground and feed primarily on plant roots.

Husník et al. BMC Biology 2011, 9:87
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/9/87

Consequently, their a-Proteobacterial symbiont Hodgkinia cicadicola originated within Rhizobiales [19]. A
similar ecological background can be noticed in yet different hosts, the ixodid and argasid ticks. Several reports
have shown that some of the tick-transmitted pathogens
are related to their symbiotic fauna [63-65]. Many of the
insect taxa associated with symbiotic Enterobacteriaceae
are phytophagous, and plant pathogens thus fit well into
this hypothesis as hypothetical ancestors of various
insect symbionts lineages. The presence of a type III
secretion system, which is used in pathogenic bacteria
for host cell invasion, in secondary symbionts [66-69]
and its remnant in the primary symbiont of Sitophilus
spp. weevils [70] could further support the theory of
pathogenic ancestors of insect symbionts. It can only be
speculated that these bacteria first became S-symbiont
type and were horizontally transferred to various other
insect species. Within some of the infected species,
facultative symbionts eventually became obligatory primary symbionts. An identical situation can be observed
in symbiotic clades with numerous species, such as Wolbachia [71,72], Sodalis [23,73,74] or Arsenophonus [5].
In our study, we gave particular attention to the sampling of free-living Enterobacteriaceae to provide as
complete a background for the symbiotic lineages as
possible under the current state of knowledge (that is,
the availability of the genomic data). The most consistent picture derived from the presented analyses places
the four main symbiotic clusters into the following positions. First, for the Buchnera cluster, its previously suggested relationship to Erwinia was confirmed. Erwinia,
as a genus of mostly plant pathogenic bacteria, has been
previously suggested to represent an ancestral organism,
which upon ingestion by aphids at least 180 million
years ago [75] turned into an intracellular symbiotic
bacterium [76]. However, it is not known whether it was
primarily pathogenic to aphids, similar to Erwinia aphidicola [77], or a gut associated symbiotic bacterium as
in pentatomid stinkbugs [78], thrips [79,80] or Tephritidae flies [81-83]. Ishikawaella capsulata, an extracellular
gut symbiont of plataspid stinkbugs [84], was the only
symbiotic bacterium that clustered in our ‘derived’ analyses with the Buchnera clade. However, several singlegene studies indicate that this group contains some
additional symbiotic lineages for which sequenced genome data is not currently available. These are, in particular, the extracellular symbionts of acanthosomatid
stinkbugs [85], parastrachid stinkbugs [86], scutellerid
stinkbugs [87,88] and some of the symbionts in pentatomid stinkbugs [78].
The second clade, represented in our analysis by Sodalis+Baumannia+Blochmannia+Wigglesworthia, is likely
to encompass many other P- and S-symbionts [89-92].
The possible single origin of these symbionts has to be

Page 11 of 17

further tested, however the interspersion of both forms,
together with basal position of Sodalis, seem to support
a transition from a secondary to primary symbiotic lifestyle [15]. In our analysis, the whole clade was placed
between pathogenic bacteria of plants and animals, the
Edwardsiella and Pectobacterium/Dickeya clades, or as a
sister to the latter group. Recently, another symbiotic
bacterium (called BEV, Euscelidius variegatus host) was
shown to be a sister species to Pectobacterium [93].
Two additional independent origins of insect symbionts are represented by the Arsenophonus/Riesia clade
and Hamiltonella+Regiella. Both of these clades clustered in our analyses in the positions indicated by previous studies, that is, as related to Proteus and Yersinia,
respectively [5,67,93-97].
While the position of individual symbiotic lineages is
remarkably consistent across our ‘artifact-resistant’ analyses and are well compatible with some of the previous
studies, the topology can only provide a rough picture
of the relationships within Enterobacteriaceae. To get a
more precise and phylogenetically meaningful background for an evolutionary interpretation, the sample of
free-living bacteria as a possible source of symbiotic
lineages has to be much improved. An illuminating
example is provided by the bacterium Biostraticola tofi,
described from water biofilms. When analyzed using
16S rDNA, this bacterium seemed to be closely related
to Sodalis [98]. Its position as a sister group to the
Sodalis/Baumannia/Blochmannia/Wigglesworthia clade
was also retrieved in our single-gene analysis (groEL,
data not shown). If confirmed by more precise multigene approach, Biostraticola would represent the closest
bacterium to the large symbiotic cluster.

Conclusions
The topologies obtained by several independent
approaches strongly support the non-monophyletic view
of enterobacterial P-symbionts. Particularly, they show
that at least three independent origins led to highly specialized symbiotic forms, the first giving rise to Sodalis,
Baumannia, Blochmannia and Wigglesworthia (S- and
P-symbionts), the second to Buchnera and Ishikawella
and the last to Riesia and Arsenophonus (S- and P-symbionts). This separation of symbiotic clusters poses an
interesting question as to whether the presented disbandment of the P-symbiotic cluster is definite or if it
will continue after yet more complete data are available
and more realistic evolutionary models [99-101] are
applied. One obvious drawback of the current state is
that many additional symbiotic lineages already known
within Enterobacteriaceae cannot be at the moment
included into serious phylogenetic analyses due to the
lack of sufficient molecular data and will have to be
revisited once complete genomic data are available.

These bacteria include symbionts of mealybugs [89,102],
psyllids [90,103], lice [2,91], weevils [11,12,92], reed beetles [104,105], true bugs [78,84-88,106,107] and symbionts of leeches [108,109]. Similarly, the importance of
free-living bacteria and variety of S-symbionts as possible ancestors of P-symbionts should not be underestimated when assembling datasets for phylogenetic
analyses. The shift from polymerase chain reactionbased gene-centered sequencing towards high-throughput next-generation sequencing may soon provide sufficient data for more complete analyses of the
Enterobacteriaceae phylogeny.

Methods
Matrices and multiple sequence alignments

The genes used in this study were extracted from 50
complete genome sequences of g-Proteobacteria available in GenBank (Additional file 4), including 14 endosymbiotic Enterobacteriaceae. We did not include
Carsonella ruddii [110] since this psyllid symbiotic bacterium does not appear to be a member of the Enterobacteriaceae clade [90,111] and is only attracted there
by the AT rich taxa. After removal of the AT rich
lineages from the analysis, Carsonella ruddii clusters
with the genus Pseudomonas [42]. Also, we did not
include Serratia symbiotica [95] because its genome
only became available after completion of our datasets.
However, the phylogenetic position of this symbiotic
bacterium within Serratia genus is robust and was confirmed in several studies [6,14,112].
To minimize the introduction of a false phylogenetic
signal, we compared the genomes of all symbiotic bacteria and selected only single-copy genes present in all
of the included symbiotic and free-living taxa. Such
strict gene exclusion was also necessary regarding the
usage of computationally demanding methods; it was
one of our goals to produce a taxonomically representative data set of efficient size with no missing data. Altogether, 69 orthologous genes, mostly involved in
translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis (Additional file 4) were selected according to the Clusters of
Orthologous Groups of proteins (COGs) [113,114]. Single-gene nucleotide data sets were downloaded via their
COG numbers from a freely available database
(MicrobesOnline [115]).
All protein coding sequences were translated into
amino acids in SeaView version 4 [116], aligned by the
MAFFT version 6 L-INS-i algorithm [117] and toggled
back to the nucleotide sequences. Ambiguously aligned
positions (codons) were excluded by Gblocks v0.91b
[118,119] with the following parameters: minimum
number of sequences for a conserved position: 26; minimum number of sequences for a flanking position: 43;
maximum number of contiguous nonconserved

Page 12 of 17

positions: 8; minimum length of a block: 10; allowed
gap positions: with half. The resulting trimmed alignments were checked and manually corrected in BioEdit
v7.0.5 [120]. Alignments were concatenated in SeaView.
The 69 gene concatenate resulted in an alignment of 63,
462 nucleic acid positions with 42, 481 parsimony-informative and 48, 527 variable sites and 21, 154 amino acid
positions with 12, 735 parsimony-informative and 15,
986 variable sites.
Phylogenetic analyses

We used two different approaches to deal with the distortions caused by the highly modified nature of symbiotic genomes, which are the main source of the
phylogenetic artifacts in phylogenetic analyses.
First, we applied complex models of molecular evolution. Using PhyloBayes 3.2f [121], we applied non-parametric site heterogeneous CAT and CAT+GTR models
[43]. For all PhyloBayes analyses, we ran two chains
with an automatic stopping option set to end the chain
when all discrepancies were lower than 0.3 and all effective sizes were larger than 100. Under the CAT and
CAT+GTR models, the four independent PhyloBayes
runs were stuck in a local maximum (maxdiff = 1) even
after 25, 000 and 10, 000 cycles, respectively, and we
were not able to reach Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) convergence. Therefore, we present these trees
only as supplementary material (although they mostly
point toward multiple origins of symbiosis; Additional
file 5) and we ran the CAT+GTR analyses with the
reduced dataset based on 14 genes with the number of
parsimony-informative amino acid positions higher than
300 (AceE, ArgS, AspS, EngA, GidA, GlyS, InfB, PheT,
Pgi, Pnp, RpoB, RpoC, TrmE and YidC). To check for
compatibility of these arbitrary selected 14 genes with
the rest of the data, we also analyzed, in a separate analysis, the remaining 55-gene dataset under the CAT
+GTR model. Using nhPhyML [122], we applied a nonhomogeneous nonstationary model of sequence evolution [123,124], which can deal with artifacts caused by
compositional heterogeneity [40,125,126]. We used two
different starting trees (Additional file 2n) and ran the
analyses with and without the third codon positions.
The resulting trees were evaluated by an AU test in
CONSEL [127].
The second approach relies on the selective restriction
of the data matrix. We used four previously established
methods of data weighting and/or exclusion (see Background): RY data recoding, amino acid data recoding,
exclusion of third codon positions and slow-fast analysis,
and developed one additional method: since transition
from G/C to A/T at many positions is a common
homoplasy of symbiotic genomes, we removed from the
matrix all positions containing both the G/C and A/T

Husník et al. BMC Biology 2011, 9:87
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/9/87

states. All substitutions considered in the subsequent
analyses thus included exclusively transversions within
the A/T or G/C categories. To analyze an effect of this
restriction on the reduction of the data, we prepared 11
matrices with a partially relaxed rule (removing all positions with AT+GC, allowing for one taxon exception,
two taxa exception, and so on, up until a 10 taxa exception). Since this method has never been tested, we analyzed the restricted matrices by the BI, ML (parameters
as for standard analyses) and MP using PAUP* 4.0b10
with the tree bisection and reconnection algorithm
[128]. Four other types of data weighting and/or exclusion were used to increase the phylogenetic signal to
noise ratio and determine the robustness of our results.
First, the third codon positions were removed in SeaView. Second, RY recoding was performed on all and
first plus second positions. Third, saturated positions
were excluded from the concatenated data sets by SlowFaster [129]. To assign substitutional rates to individual
positions, unambiguously monophyletic groups were
chosen on a polytomic tree (Additional file 2o), positions with the highest rates were gradually excluded and
21 restricted matrices were produced. These weighted
data sets were analyzed by ML. Fourth, amino acid data
recoding was performed in PhyloBayes with hp (A, C, F,
G, I, L, M, V, W) (D, E, H, K, N, P, Q, R, S, T, Y), dayhoff4 (A, G, P, S, T) (D, E, N, Q) (H, K, R) (F, Y, W, I, L,
M, V) (C = ?) and dayhoff6 (A, G, P, S, T) (D, E, N, Q)
(H, K, R) (F, Y, W) (I, L, M, V) (C) recoding schemes.
In addition, we have prepared 10 dayhoff6 recoded
matrices to test individual symbiotic lineages without
the presence of other symbionts. Amino acid recoded
matrices were analyzed using the CAT and CAT+GTR
models, which are more immune to phylogenetic artifacts than one-matrix models.
To allow for comparison of the results with previously
published studies, as well as to separate the effect of
newly used models and methods from changes due to
the extended sampling, we also used standard procedures of phylogenetic inference, ML and BI. The following programs, algorithms and parameters were used in
the ML and BI analyses. ML was applied to single-gene
and concatenated alignments of both nucleotides and
amino acids using PhyML v3.0 [130] with the subtree
pruning and regrafting tree search algorithm. BI was
performed in MrBayes 3.1.2 [131] with one to five million generations and tree sampling every 100 generations. Exploration of MCMC convergence and burn-in
determination was performed in AWTY and Tracer v1.5
[132,133]. Evolutionary substitution models for proteins
were selected by ProtTest 2.4 [134] and for DNA by
jModelTest 0.1.1 [135] according to the Akaike Information Criterion. For DNA sequences, the GTR+I+Γ model
was used [136-138]. Transition and transversion models

Page 13 of 17

[139] were used with I+Γ under ML for the first two
AT/GC datasets. LG+I+Γ [140], WAG+I+Γ [141] and
GTR+I+Γ models were used for amino acid data. A
cross-validation method implemented in PhyloBayes
[121,142] was used to estimate the fit of CAT-like models. For both datasets, the 14 selected genes as well as
the complete 69 genes set, the cross-validation was performed according to the PhyloBayes manual in 10 replicates each with 1, 100 cycles. The CAT-Poisson model
had significantly better fit to the data than the GTR
model (Δl 157.37 ± 56.9379 for the 14-gene matrix and
Δl 3923.9 ± 1963.5 for the 69-gene matrix); of the CATlike models, the CAT+GTR model was found to be significantly better than the CAT-Poisson model (Δl
536.71 ± 32.8341 for the 14-gene matrix and Δl 1633.4
± 123.482 for the 69-gene matrix) in all 10 replicates.
