Background
Previous studies have suggested that mother-to-child
transmission of HIV-1 is often characterized by acquisition of a homogeneous viral quasispecies in the infant [13], suggestive of a genetic bottleneck. In this study, we
have analyzed the molecular characteristics of transmitted
HIV-1 viruses in a homogeneous population infected by
CRF01_AE variants in Thailand.

Materials and methods
Seventeen mother-child pairs were studied. The infants
were not breastfed. Six infants were infected in utero and
11 infants were infected intrapartum. The env sequences
covering the entire gp120 were amplified from both the
proviral DNA of maternal PBMC collected at delivery and
the plasma viral RNA at first positive time point of infants.
The amplified products were cloned and sequenced. A
total of 353 clones were available for analysis.

Results
Phylogenetic analysis indicated 2 patterns of transmission: 14 mothers transmitted a single variant and 3 mothers transmitted multiple variants to their infants. The

mean genetic distance of viruses from the mothers was significantly higher than those from the infants (2.7% vs.
0.6%; P<0.01), but without any difference according to
timing of transmission, either in utero or intrapartum. The
length of gp120 and number of potential N-linked glycosylation sites (PNGS) were similar in both the entire
gp120 and individual regions of gp120 of all motherchild pairs. However, our data indicate that 4 PNGS positions (N241, N301, N354, and N384) that appeared conserved in all infant variants but were irregularly present in
the mothers might be associated to a selective advantage.
In addition, we report the first case to our knowledge of
transmission to an infant of a recombinant virus issued
from variants from his mother.

Conclusions
Our results provide additional evidence that despite a
complex viral population in the mother, only viruses of a
restricted subset are transmitted to the infant, independently of the timing of transmission, in utero or intrapartum. We did not find that shorter gp120 or fewer PNGS
were characteristics of viruses transmitted from mother to
infant, as it was suggested for sexually transmitted viruses

at least for a few subtypes [4-7]. Four PNGS were selected
for transmitted viruses, supporting the role of the “glycan
shield” of the HIV-1 envelope in conferring a selective
advantage.
