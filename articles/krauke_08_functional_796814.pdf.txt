Abstract
Background: The virulence of Candida species depends on many environmental conditions.
Extracellular pH and concentration of alkali metal cations belong among important factors.
Nevertheless, the contribution of transporters mediating the exchange of alkali metal cations for
protons across the plasma membrane to the cell salt tolerance and other physiological properties
of various Candida species has not been studied so far.
Results: The tolerance/sensitivity of four pathogenic Candida species to alkali metal cations was
tested and the role of one of the cation transporters in that tolerance (presumed to be the plasmamembrane Na+/H+ antiporter) was studied. The genes encoding these antiporters in the most and
least salt sensitive species, C. dubliniensis and C. parapsilosis respectively, were identified, cloned and
functionally expressed in the plasma membranes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells lacking their own
cation exporters. Both CpCnh1 and CdCnh1 antiporters had broad substrate specificity and
transported Na+, K+, Li+, and Rb+. Their activity in S. cerevisiae cells differed; CpCnh1p provided
cells with a much higher salt tolerance than the CdCnh1 antiporter. The observed difference in
activity was confirmed by direct measurements of sodium and potassium efflux mediated by these
antiporters.
Conclusion: We have cloned two genes encoding putative Na+/H+ antiporters in C. parapsilosis
and C. dubliniensis, and characterized the transport properties of encoded proteins. Our results
show that the activity of plasma-membrane Na+/H+ antiporters is one of the factors determining
the tolerance of pathogenic Candida species to high external concentrations of alkali metal cations.

Background
The family of Candida species, normally a harmless
human commensal of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tract, can become a human pathogen under certain
circumstances. Mainly in HIV and immunocompromised
patients, Candida cause a wide range of infections and are
the most prevalent pathogenic yeast. One key feature of
these fungi is their ability to grow in three different morphologies: yeast, pseudohyphae and true hyphae [1]. This

reversible switching from one form to another is dependent on environmental conditions like temperature, pH,
nutritional status and external/internal concentration of
cations [2].
In general, pathogenic Candida species are osmotolerant
yeasts and can grow, with the exception of Candida dubliniensis [3], at relatively high NaCl concentrations,
although the presence of salt was shown to negatively

influence several virulence traits of Candida albicans [4].
Recent experiments also suggest a relationship between
the formation of C. albicans hyphae and the intracellular
concentration of potassium [5]. Nevertheless, the regulation of intracellular potassium and sodium concentrations in Candida species has not been studied in detail.
Yeast species in general have several transport systems in
their plasma membranes at their disposal to maintain
homeostasis in alkali metal cations, i.e. a high ratio
between potassium (which is the main intracellular cation) and toxic sodium concentrations [6-8]. Among these
transport systems, Na+/H+ antiporters play an important
role. Most yeasts that have so far been studied (e.g. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Debaryomyces hansenii) possess only one
type of this antiporter in their plasma membranes, which
efficiently transports both sodium and potassium cations
from the cells, as well as their analogues lithium and
rubidium [7,9]. A few yeast species (Yarrowia lipolytica,
Schizosaccharomyces pombe) have two antiporters of this
family at their disposal, one of them with a substrate preference for sodium and lithium, the other preferring potassium and rubidium [10,11].

has 12 predicted trans-membrane domains and a very
long hydrophilic C-terminus [7]. Beside its function in
removing toxic Na+ from cells and maintaining potassium
homeostasis, it is involved in several other cellular functions such as regulating intracellular pH [12,13], cell volume [7], plasma membrane potential [14] and the cell
cycle [15,16], and it participates in the cell response to
osmotic shock [7,17]. The Nha1p orthologs from C. albicans and Candida tropicalis CaCnh1p and CtCnh1p,
respectively, were functionally characterized upon heterologous expression in S. cerevisiae. Both showed the same
broad substrate specificity as ScNha1p [18,19]. The deletion of CNH1 in C. albicans results in cell sensitivity to
high external potassium concentrations [20] and under
some conditions causes slight changes in cell morphology
[21].
In this work we compared the tolerance of four different
pathogenic Candida species to alkali metal cations, performed a search for Nha1/Cnh1 antiporter-encoding
orthologs in their genomes, and characterized the transport properties of the Na+/H+ antiporters from the most
and least tolerant species, C. parapsilosis and C. dubliniensis
respectively.

The Na+/H+ antiporter that has been studied the most so
far is from S. cerevisiae, encoded by the NHA1 gene, and

Results

antiporters have a broad substrate specificity to alkali
metal cations, similar to those of C. albicans and C. tropicalis. We named the identified orthologous genes according to their species of origin, CdCNH1, CgCNH1 and
CpCNH1. The CdCNH1 gene is 2454 nt (818 aa) long,
CgCNH1 has 2835 nt (945 aa), and the CpCNH1 gene is
composed of 2955 nt (985 aa). Neither of them have any
introns.

Candida species differ in their halotolerance
According to the literature [3], C. dubliniensis is relatively
sodium sensitive, whereas C. parapsilosis was shown to tolerate high NaCl concentrations [22]. In order to estimate
the tolerance of Candida species to different alkali metal
cations, the growth of four Candida species and a S. cerevisiae wild type (as a non-osmotolerant control) in the presence of increasing concentrations of various salts was
estimated. In the absence of salts, S. cerevisiae cells grew
more slowly than all four Candida species, and also the
growth of C. parapsilosis was not as robust as with the
other three Candida species (Figure 1). All yeast species
grew equally well in the presence of lower salt concentrations (cf. Methods) but as the amount of alkali-metal-cation on the plates increased, important differences were
observed. Of the tested Candida species, C. dubliniensis
had the lowest tolerance to all of the tested salts, it is not
able to grow when the salt concentrations are above 1600
mM NaCl, 2300 mM KCl or 200 mM LiCl. Nevertheless,
C. dubliniensis is more sodium, potassium and rubidium
tolerant than S. cerevisiae, but is much more sensitive to
toxic lithium cations (Figure 1). Also, the lithium sensitivity of C. glabrata is higher than that of S. cerevisiae but C.
glabrata cells can grow in much higher concentrations of
the other salts than S. cerevisiae cells (up to 2300 mM
NaCl, 2400 mM KCl, 1800 mM RbCl; Figure 1). C. albicans and C. parapsilosis are the most halotolerant species,
and C. parapsilosis seems to grow even better in the presence of high salt concentrations than C. albicans (Figure
1). To summarize, the four Candida species have not only
different sensitivity to NaCl, as published previously
[3,22] but they differ in their tolerance to alkali metal cations in general. C. albicans and C. parapsilosis are highly
halotolerant and C. dubliniensis is halosensitive.

The predicted protein structures of these three antiporters
were compared with the two Candida antiporters that have
already been characterized, CaCnh1 and CtCnh1. Comparison of the protein length and predicted structure of
the Cnh1 proteins from five Candida species and S. cerevisiae revealed that CpCnh1p is the longest and C. dublinienis antiporter the shortest member of the Candida Na+/
H+antiporters' subfamily (Table 1). For all Candida proteins, the Kyte-Doolittle method predicted a similar structure to ScNha1p with highly conserved N-termini and 12
trans-membrane sections (Tables 1 &2). On the other
hand, they differ in the length and composition of their
hydrophilic C-termini, as do the antiporters from nonCandida yeast species [23]. The most significant is the difference in length (approx. 180 aa) between the C-termini
of CpCnh1p (555 aa), CaCnh1p (366 aa) and CdCnh1p
(388 aa). Of the analyzed proteins, CaCnh1p and
CdCnh1p show the highest sequence identity in all parts
of the protein, though the hydrophobic trans-membrane
domains and connecting loops are highly conserved
(approx. 90% identity) in all Candida antiporters except
for CgCnh1p (Table 2). C. glabrata Cnh1p is more similar
to S. cerevisiae Nha1p than to the antiporters from other
Candida species in all the features analyzed, which corresponds to the phylogenetic relationships among these
yeast species [24].

Comparison of Candida CNH1 genes and encoded
antiporters
A search in databases revealed the existence of open reading frames homologous to the CaCNH1 gene in the
genomes of C. dubliniensis, C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis.
In these species, just one homologous sequence was
found, suggesting that their plasma-membrane Na+/H+

Though the highest divergence from identity was found in
the C-termini of all the compared antiporters, the existence of six conserved C-terminal regions described previously [18] was also confirmed in C.dubliniensis, C.
parapsilosis and C. glabrata species (not shown). A new,

R)RKVYAHR (in CaCnh1p aa 639–664) preceding conserved region no. 5 [18]; was found in the four Candida
species, except for C. glabrata.
Both the C. dubliniensis and C. parapsilosis species belong
to the group of yeasts in which the CTG codon encodes a
serine and not a leucine, as in other yeast species (i.e. S.
cerevisiae) [25]. One CTG codon exists at aa position 621
in CpCNH1. This serine 621 is localized in the antiporter's
hydrophilic C-terminus and not in the membrane part of
the protein. It is localized in a small weakly conserved area
where at a similar position CdCnh1p (aa 568) and
CtCnh1p (aa 644) also have a serine and CaCnh1p (aa
552) has an isoleucine.
Heterologous expression of Candida Cnh1ps in S.
cerevisiae BW31a cells and its phenotype
In order to 1) verify whether the identified and analysed
open reading frames encode functional plasma-membrane alkali-metal-cation/proton antiporters, and 2) elucidate whether the species' salt tolerance could reflect the
activity of these antiporters, corresponding DNA fragments from the most and least salt tolerant species, C. parapsilosis and C. dubliniensis respectively, were expressed in
a S. cerevisiae mutant lacking its own export systems for
alkali metal cations (BW31a ena1-4Δ nha1Δ [8]). The lack
of both Na+-ATPases, Ena1-4 and the Na+/H+ antiporter
Nha1 renders these cells extremely sensitive to higher
external concentrations of salts, and almost no efflux of
sodium or potassium cations from them is observable.
The functional expression of heterologous sodium and/or
potassium exporters in BW31a cells has clear phenotypes
of an increased salt tolerance and measurable alkali metal
cation efflux [26].

The CdCNH1 and CpCNH1 genes amplified from
genomic DNAs were cloned behind the ScNHA1 promoter and expressed from multicopy vectors, as were the
genes ScNHA1 and CaCNH1 [7,19], which served as positive controls in our study. Thus all four antiporters were
expressed under the same conditions (strain, vector, promoter) which should ensure similar antiporters' levels in
cells. Empty YEp352 and pGRU1 vectors served as nega-

tive controls. The functionality of all the constructs were
first tested in drop experiments, which showed that 1) the
presence of the constructs did not influence the growth
rate of cells in standard media, i.e. the heterologous
expression of these membrane proteins was not toxic for
S. cerevisiae, and 2) the expression of both GFP-tagged and
non-tagged CdCnh1 and CpCnh1 proteins brought about
the same ability to grow on 800 mM NaCl or 1800 mM
KCl, as did the positive controls with ScNha1 and CaCnh1
proteins, whereas the cells without antiporters were not
able to grow (not shown). This result also confirmed that
the C-terminal GFP-tagging did not influence the activity
of the antiporters. In order to estimate the substrate specificity and transport capacity of the antiporters, BW31a
cells expressing the four antiporters or transformed with
an empty vector were spotted on a series of YNB plates
containing increasing NaCl, KCl, LiCl and RbCl concentrations. Cells expressing CpCnhp1p were able to grow in
the highest concentrations of salts, as did cells expressing
CaCnh1p. Both these Candida antiporters conferred a
slightly higher tolerance to the cells than equivalent
expression of the native S. cerevisiae antiporter, Nha1p
(Figure 2). The tolerance of cells expressing CdCnh1p to
high external potassium and rubidium was almost the
same as for cells expressing CpCnhp1p and CaCnh1p (Figure 2), but their tolerance to toxic cations was significantly
lower, only 1000 mM NaCl, and there was no increase in
LiCl tolerance compared to cells with the empty vector
(30 mM LiCl in both cases).
The proton-antiport mechanism of these Cnh1 proteins
was verified in a series of drop tests on plates with various
pH values (Table 3). As was previously thought, the cells
expressing antiporters showed the highest salt tolerance
(at least for three of their four substrates) when grown at
lower external pH, i.e. in conditions where the proton gradient across the plasma membrane is the highest. Surprisingly, the expression of both the S. cerevisiae and C.
dubliniensis antiporters did not increase the cell tolerance
to lithium cations at pH 3.5, suggesting that Li+ was not
recognized as their substrate under these conditions. On
the other hand, all four antiporters were partially active,
even at an externally neutral pH 7.0, as their presence ena-

bled the cells to support higher salt concentrations. This
detailed study confirmed again that CdCnh1p has the
least ability to improve the salt tolerance of cells (Table 3).
Localization of CdCnh1 and CpCnh1 antiporters in S.
cerevisiae cells
As mentioned above, C-terminal GFP-tagging of the
CdCnh1 and CpCnh1 proteins did not affected their functionality. Both antiporters improved the cell salt tolerance
to a similar degree as the non-tagged versions, and fluorescence microscopy localized them to the plasma membrane of S. cerevisiae BW31a cells (Figure 3) and not to the

membranes of intracellular organelles. This result indicates a high probability of the same localization in their
organisms of origin, as was previously shown for C. albicans Cnh1p [20].
Western blot analysis of antiporters' amount in cells
To verify whether the use of the same vector and promoter
for expression ensures similar levels of the four antiporters
in BW31a cells, the GFP-tagged proteins were visualized
on western blots. Fig. 4 shows that 1) the size of Sc and Cp
antiporters was alike, similarly as the size of Ca and Cd
transporters (and in agreement with the size deduced

from the gene sequence, cf. Table 1 and 2) the quantity of
antiporters in extracts of exponentially growing cells was
similar, the highest amount apparently being observed for
CdCnh1p and the lowest one for CpCnh1 antiporter. The
analysis was repeated three times with the same result.
The fluorescence microscopy and western blot analysis
confirmed that the observed low activity of CdCnh1p and
the high activity of CpCnh1 antiporter did not reflect different protein levels in the cells.
Efflux of Na+ and K+ from BW31a cells expressing various
antiporters
To confirm the results from drop test experiments and to
determine the activity and efflux rate of CdCnh1p and
CpCnh1p, the efflux of K+ and Na+ was directly measured.
The loss of K+ from BW31a cells expressing C. dubliniensis
or C. parapsilosis antiporters was measured directly; to
measure Na+ efflux, cell preloading with 100 mM NaCl
was necessary (cf. Methods). Cells expressing the CaCnh1
antiporter served as positive, and cells transformed with
an empty vector as negative controls, respectively. The initial internal concentration of K+ in exponentially growing
cells was almost the same in all strains, in the representative experiment about 549.5 ± 25.7 nmol (mg dry wt)-1.
After preloading, cells contained 110.5 ± 6.8 nmol (mg
dry wt)-1 Na+. As shown in Figure 5 and Table 4, CpCnh1p
exported Na+ and K+ much more efficiently than
CdCnh1p. Within 60 minutes, cells with CpCnh1p lost
80% of their internal sodium and 32% of their potassium
compared to cells with CdCnh1p, which over the same

period only lost 38% of their sodium and 20% of their
potassium. The C. albicans antiporter was the most effective, exporting 82% of its host cells' sodium and 55% of
their potassium in 60 min, which agrees with previously
published results [19]. The Na+ efflux curves for CaCnh1p
and CpCnh1p are very similar and almost exponential;
most of the sodium is exported in about 40 minutes. The
efflux of sodium via CdCnh1p is linear and slow. The
sodium efflux via all three antiporters is faster than their
potassium efflux, though the initial intracellular concentration of K+ is much higher than that of Na+, approx. 300
vs. 50 mM. These results suggest that the Candida antiporters have, at least upon heterologous expression in S. cerevisiae, a higher affinity for sodium than for potassium
cations.

Discussion and Conclusion
The variable sensitivity of Candida species to NaCl has
been observed and exploited previously, mainly in connection with the original niche of the species, e.g. the high
NaCl tolerance of C. parapsilosis strains isolated from sea
water or hypersaline brines [22,27] or in clinical microbiological tests aiming to distinguish among Candida species (NaCl sensitivity of C. dubliniensis[3]). In this work,
we performed a series of tests to characterize the tolerance
of four different pathogenic Candida species to different
alkali metal cations, and addressed the question of
whether the observed differences in salt tolerance could
be based on the transport activity and/or specificity of
Candidas' plasma-membrane Na+/H+ antiporters. Our
results showed clearly that, besides differences in their tolerance to sodium, the four species tested also differ in
their sensitivity to highly toxic lithium and their tolerance
of high external concentrations of non-toxic potassium

cations (Figure 1). C. glabrata and C. dubliniensis are the
most sensitive to Li+ cations, the latter being the least
alkali-metal-cation tolerant of the species tested.
To elucidate the role of Na+/H+ antiporters in Candidas'
salt tolerance, we isolated and heterologously expressed
genes encoding putative antiporters in the most and the
least tolerant species, C. parapsilosis and C. dubliniensis.
The functional characterization of these encoded proteins
in an S. cerevisiae mutant lacking its own alkali-metal-cation exporters revealed that both antiporters have broad
substrate specificity. They recognize at least four different
cations (K+, Li+, Na+, Rb+), but transport them with varying capacities and/or affinities. C. parapsilosis and C. albicans Cnh1 proteins are very efficient transporters and their
capacities exceed that of S. cerevisiae Nha1p. On the other
hand, the C. dubliniensis antiporter has a much lower
transport activity and its ability to recognize and transport
the smallest cation, toxic lithium, is very limited compared to the other two Candida antiporters (Figure 2,
Table 3). The large difference between the transport activities of the evolutionary close C. albicans and C. dubliniensis Cnh1 antiporters is worth noting, as these two proteins
shared the highest level of identity (Table 2). Their core
membrane section (twelve tms and connecting loops) is
almost 99% identical and their N-termini, composed of
11 aa residues, are 100% identical. These two antiporters
differ slightly (compared to other antiporters) in the
length and composition of their hydrophilic C-termini.
Whether the observed transport capacities are based on
the C-terminal difference remain to be established,
though previous studies showed that the C-termini of
yeast Na+/H+ antiporters are not the most important factor
in this activity [7] and that a single amino-acid exchange
in one of the transmembrane domains can significantly
influence both the substrate specificity and transport
capacity of the antiporter [28,29].
Though the C. parapsilosis Cnh1 antiporter mediates a
high and efficient sodium efflux from S. cerevisiae cells
(similarly as the CaCnh1p, Figure 5 and Table 4), its phys-

iological role in C. parapsilosis remains to be established.
A recent study [20] showed that the Cnh1 antiporter is
mainly important in potassium homeostasis in C. albicans
cells and its role in Na+ detoxification is rather marginal.
The differences observed in alkali-metal-cation tolerance
between C. dubliniensis and C. parapsilosis/C. albicans species were also found upon testing the alkali-metal-cation
tolerance of S. cerevisiae cells expressing the antiporters of
these three species. Efflux measurements confirmed that
the differing tolerances of S. cerevisiae cells were based on
the differing transport activities of the Candida antiporters. Altogether, our results suggest that the activity of
plasma-membrane Na+/H+ antiporters is one of the factors determining the tolerance to high external concentrations of alkali metal cations in pathogenic Candida
species.

Methods
Yeast strains, media and growth conditions
To determine the salt tolerance of various Candida species,
C. albicans SC5314, C. glabrata ATCC2001, C. dubliniensis
CD36 and C. parapsilosis CBS604 were used, together with
S. cerevisiae S288c as a control. The CdCNH1 and CpCNH1
genes were isolated from C. dubliniensis CD36 and C. parapsilosis CBS604, and heterologously expressed in S. cerevisiae BW31a (ena1-4Δ nha1Δ, W303 derivative, [8]). Yeast
cells were grown in YPD or YNB-NH4+ media supplemented with 2% glucose at 30°C. Salts were added to the
media prior to and auxotrophic supplements after autoclaving.
DNA manipulations, plasmid construction and DNA
sequencing
For DNA manipulations, standard protocols [30] were
used. The CdCNH1 and CpCNH1 gene were amplified by

PCR with platinum Pfx polymerase with proofreading
activity (Invitrogen) using their isolated genomic DNA
[31] as a template.
Plasmids for the heterologous expression of these antiporters in S. cerevisiae were constructed by homologous
recombination in BW31a cells. The oligonucleotides used
are listed in Table 5. Two types of plasmids were constructed. CdCNH1 and CpCNH1 coding sequences were
cloned behind the ScNHA1 promoter either in multicopy
YEp352 or in pGRU1, enabling C-terminal GFP tagging
[7]. All constructs were analysed by sequencing in an ABI
PRISM 3100 DNA sequencer using the BigDye Terminator
v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems).
Salt tolerance determination
The cell tolerance to various alkali metal cations was
determined by drop test experiments. 3 μl of serial 10-fold
dilutions of saturated cell cultures were spotted on solid
media. For Candida species, YPD – 3% agar plates supplemented with increasing amounts of salts were used (800
– 2600 mM NaCl; 1800 – 2500 mM KCl; 20 – 1000 mM
LiCl; 700 – 1800 mM RbCl). Determination of the maximum salt tolerance of S. cerevisiae BW31a cells expressing
either of the antiporters was performed on solid YNB
media supplemented with salts and adjusted to various
pH levels as described previously [7]. The following salt
concentrations were used: 1) non-adjusted pH, 500–1500
mM NaCl; 1800–2100 mM KCl; 25–40 mM LiCl; 1000–
1600 mM RbCl; 2) pH 3.5, 500–1300 mM NaCl; 1600–
2200 mM KCl; 20–50 mM LiCl; 3) pH 5.5, 200–1000 mM
NaCl; 1900–2200 mM KCl; 15–40 mM LiCl; 4) pH 7.0,
50–200 mM NaCl; 800–1500 mM KCl; 5–10 mM LiCl.
Cation efflux measurements
The transport activity of the antiporters was measured as
the cation efflux from cells according to [7] with minor
modifications. Cells were grown to OD600 ≈ 0.2 in YNB,
harvested and then a pH 5.5 incubation buffer (20 mM
MES, supplemented with 10 mM KCl or 10 mM RbCl to
prevent Na+ or K+ reuptake respectively) was used. For the
determination of Na+ efflux, the cells were preloaded for
60 min with 100 mM NaCl in YNB adjusted to pH 7.0

with NH4OH. The K+ efflux was measured directly in the
harvested cells. Samples were taken from cell incubation
cultures at regular time intervals over a period of 60 min
and the cellular cation content was determined by atomic
absorption spectroscopy [7]. Each efflux experiment was
repeated at least three times and representative results are
shown.
Microscopy analysis
Exponential phase cells (grown in YNB at 30°C, OD600 ≈
0.15) expressing the CdCHN1 or CpCNH1 gene tagged
with the GFP sequence were viewed with an Olympus
AX70 microscope using a U-MWB cube with a 450–480
nm excitation filter and 515 nm barrier filter. The micrographs were recorded with a DP70 digital camera using
the program DP Controller. For whole-cell pictures,
Nomarski optics was used.
Immunoblotting
Exponetially growing (OD600 ≅ 0.15) BW31a cells expressing GFP-tagged antiporters were harvested and concentrated by centrifugation to OD600 = 3.0. The proteins were
extracted according to [32] with some modifications. After
resuspension of cell pellet in 150 μl freshly prepared 1.85
M NaOH with 7.5% β-mercaptoethanol and incubation
for 15 min on ice, 150 μl of cold 50% trichloroacetic acid
were added. After incubation on ice for 20 min the collection of precipates by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20
min followed. The pellet was resuspended in 190 μl of 50
mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 6.8), containing 8 M urea, 5%
sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 0.1 mM EDTA and 1.5%
dithiothreitol (DTT) + 10 μl 1 M Tris base. After incubation for 30 min at 37°C the samples were centrifuged at
20,000 × g for 30 min. Supernatant (7.5 μl) were directly
loaded on 8% glycine gel and separated by polyacrylamid
gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Separated proteins were transferred via electroblotting on nitrocellulose membrane. To
detect the GFP-tagged proteins on membranes, rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotech., diluted
1:200), secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody with conjugated peroxidase (BioRad, diluted 1:10,000) and ECL
detection kit (Pierce) were used.
