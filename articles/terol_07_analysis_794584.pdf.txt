Abstract
Background: Improvement of Citrus, the most economically important fruit crop in the world, is
extremely slow and inherently costly because of the long-term nature of tree breeding and an
unusual combination of reproductive characteristics. Aside from disease resistance, major
commercial traits in Citrus are improved fruit quality, higher yield and tolerance to environmental
stresses, especially salinity.
Results: A normalized full length and 9 standard cDNA libraries were generated, representing
particular treatments and tissues from selected varieties (Citrus clementina and C. sinensis) and
rootstocks (C. reshni, and C. sinenis × Poncirus trifoliata) differing in fruit quality, resistance to
abscission, and tolerance to salinity. The goal of this work was to provide a large expressed
sequence tag (EST) collection enriched with transcripts related to these well appreciated
agronomical traits. Towards this end, more than 54000 ESTs derived from these libraries were
analyzed and annotated. Assembly of 52626 useful sequences generated 15664 putative
transcription units distributed in 7120 contigs, and 8544 singletons. BLAST annotation produced
significant hits for more than 80% of the hypothetical transcription units and suggested that 647 of
these might be Citrus specific unigenes. The unigene set, composed of ~13000 putative different
transcripts, including more than 5000 novel Citrus genes, was assigned with putative functions based
on similarity, GO annotations and protein domains

Conclusion: Comparative genomics with Arabidopsis revealed the presence of putative
conserved orthologs and single copy genes in Citrus and also the occurrence of both gene
duplication events and increased number of genes for specific pathways. In addition, phylogenetic
analysis performed on the ammonium transporter family and glycosyl transferase family 20
suggested the existence of Citrus paralogs. Analysis of the Citrus gene space showed that the most
important metabolic pathways known to affect fruit quality were represented in the unigene set.
Overall, the similarity analyses indicated that the sequences of the genes belonging to these
varieties and rootstocks were essentially identical, suggesting that the differential behaviour of
these species cannot be attributed to major sequence divergences. This Citrus EST assembly
contributes both crucial information to discover genes of agronomical interest and tools for genetic
and genomic analyses, such as the development of new markers and microarrays.

Background
Citrus fruits are the first fruit crop in international trade in
terms of economic value (FAO, 2004). Citrus fruits are
typically grown in 140 countries located in tropical and
subtropical areas with "Mediterranean" type climates,
often facing severe abiotic stresses such as salinity,
drought and iron chlorosis. Citrus species also suffer from
different diseases and pests that considerably affect tree
growth and fruit crop. The survival of the citrus industry is
today critically dependent on genetically superior cultivars. However, citrus improvement through traditional
techniques is unfortunately very difficult due to the unusual combination of biological characteristics of Citrus
species, their low genetic diversity and the long-term
nature of tree breeding. Thus, Citrus show many biological
characteristics such as gametophytic self- and crossincompatibility, apomixy, juvenility, heterozygosis, dormancy, and surprising root/shoot interactions, that
strongly hamper Citrus breeding. On the other hand,
genetic and allelic diversity in Citrus cultivars is very
scarce. The global linkage disequilibrium in the cultivated
citrus that probably originated from three major taxa, may
be the result of an initial allopatric evolution and further
limitation for predominant apomixy [1]. The fact that
only mutational and/or epigenetic events are apparently
involved in the diversification of secondary species, combined with human selection, have strongly reduced global
genetic diversity, restricting opportunity for genetic
advance.
Genomics has provided new tools for crop improvement,
helping to identify and select candidate genes responsible
of agronomic characters of interest, and allowing the
development of fast methods to incorporate these characters into crop plants. After the completion of the Arabidopsis genome sequence [2] and the publication of
sequences of indica [3] and japonica [4] rice, plant
researchers have been able to scan these genomes to identify and compare genes of interest. The completion of the
poplar genome sequence [5] will supply a model for tree
life forms.

EST sequencing projects have facilitated appropriate strategies for gene discovery [6], molecular markers identification [7,8], and many other functional genomic
developments and tools, e.g. microarray approaches [911]. In Citrus, previous EST sequencing projects have
released more than 130000 ESTs to Gen Bank, mainly
from C. sinensis, C. unshiu and C. clementina [12-16]. This
information has been used to develop two different
microarray platforms, based on cDNA and short oligo
sequences [12,17]. In this work, main efforts have been
specifically focussed on the study of pivotal traits for Citrus breeding, such as fruit quality, productivity and salinity tolerance. In citrus there are many aspects of fruit
quality such as fruit size, shape, colour, texture, flavour
and aroma compounds, and several other organoleptic
properties that are acquired during ripening and earlier
stages of growth [18-20]. Regarding productivity, pivotal
traits to be improved are the capacity for fruit set and the
resistance to abscission. Clementine mandarin (Citrus
clementina), for example, is a self-incompatible cultivar
that shows elevated ovary and fruitlet abscission while
sweet orange varieties (Citrus sinensis), that in general
exhibit standard fruit-set ratios [21,22], may lose most of
the yield during ripening. In addition, the quantity and
quality of water can become a limiting factor to economically viable production. In Citrus, it is notorious for example, that during the periods of drought, leaves and fruits
remain attached to the tree until water is available and
soon afterwards these organs abscise [23,24]. It is also
well known that salt excess affects the size and quality of
the production. The capability of Citrus to tolerate salinity
is mostly related to the ability of the rootstock to exclude
chloride, although the nature of this mechanism remains
unresolved [25]. Tolerant Cleopatra mandarin rootstock
(C. reshni), for example, accumulated lower chloride
amounts than sensitive Carrizo (C. sinenis × Poncirus trifoliata) [26,27]. The scion variety also plays a role in salinity
damage, and more tolerant varieties such as Clementine
are generally preferred to sweet oranges [28]. Toward this
goal, cDNA libraries were prepared from the following
selected genotypes: the varieties Citrus clementina (cv.

Clementina de Nules; elevated fruit quality, low setting)
and C. sinensis (cv Washington Navel and Navelina; preharvest abscission and low salt tolerance, respectively),
and the rootstocks C. reshni (cv Cleopatra; salt tolerant),
and C. sinenis × Poncirus trifoliata (cv Carrizo; salt sensitive). The information generated with this effort, complementary to the Spanish Citrus Functional Genomics
Project [12], has also been used for the construction of a
second generation cDNA microarray of recent release. In
the study, special attention has been paid on the methodological aspects, in order to obtain accurate estimates of
the number of different transcripts and precise predictions
of their function.

The full length library was constructed in Clementine
plants, the species of main interest, grown in open field
and in controlled greenhouse conditions. A broad variety
of tissues and organs at different developmental stages
were harvested from healthy plants and from plants subjected to many biotic (viruses, insects, fungus...setc) and
abiotic (drought, salinity, ozone, alkaline-calcareous
soils, flooding.etc) stresses. This strategy was planned to
obtain the widest representation of the Citrus clementina
transcriptome, including low abundant cDNAs, and to
facilitate identification of genes of agronomic interest. A
detailed description of the libraries is given in Materials
and Methods.

The results of this joint initiative of the IVIA, CIRAD and
Genoscope designed to provide new information and useful tools for Citrus improvement, will speed up the discovery of genes of major agronomic interest and facilitate the
development of new markers and methods to rapidly
identify improved genotypes.

EST Sequencing and Clustering
A total number of 54136 clones were single-pass
sequenced from their 5' end. After low quality and vector
trimming, 52626 sequences longer than 100 bp were
assembled with the CAP3 program [30]. All these
sequences are available at the EST section of the GenBank.
The assembly grouped 44082 ESTs into 7120 contigs,
while 8544 sequences remained as singletons. The combined set of contigs and singletons resulted in 15664 unigenes representing different putative transcripts from
Citrus species. The average length of the unigenes was
1071 bp, and 9877 of them (63%) were longer than 1000
bp. The distribution of ESTs in the contigs was the
expected, with many clusters composed of 10 or less ESTs
(Fig 1A). To estimate redundancy levels, the 15664 unigenes were compared with each other with the BLASTN
program [31]. Sequences with at least 98% nucleotide
identity over a minimum of 100 bp were assumed to be
derived from the same transcript and therefore were clustered in supercontigs using an in-house R algorithm. Clustering of the unigenes resulted in 1135 supercontigs and
12759 singletons, indicating ~26% redundancy. Thus, the
real number of identified expressed genes was close to
13900.

Results
Library Construction
Samples were harvested from 4 different Citrus species: the
varieties Citrus clementina (cv. Clementina de Nules; elevated fruit quality, low setting) and C. sinensis (cv Washington Navel and Navelina; pre-harvest abscission and
low salt tolerance, respectively), and the rootstocks C.
reshni (cv Cleopatra; salt tolerant), and C. sinenis × Poncirus
trifoliata (cv Carrizo; salt sensitive).

EST sequences were derived from 9 cDNA libraries constructed with standard methods and 1 additional normalized full length cDNA library (Table 1). Standard libraries,
prepared from all five cultivars, were designed to represent
three main agronomic traits of interest for Citrus improvement, i.e. fruit quality, production and salt tolerance.
Since fruit quality characteristics are acquired not only
during ripening but also along fruit growth [18], 2 libraries covering all pivotal developmental stages were constructed from fruit pulp and peel tissues of the high
quality variety, Clementine (FruitTF, and PhIIIIIVesicles1). Abscission zones and surrounding tissues
from developing ovaries, fruitlets, leaves and ripe fruits
were represented in 4 libraries (AbsAOv1, Abs Cov1,
AbsDev, and AbsCFruit1) from Clementine, the genotype
with impaired fruit set [29] and Washington Navel, the
variety with higher pre-harvest abscission. To study the
response to abiotic stresses, 3 libraries were prepared with
samples derived from leaves and roots subjected to salinity or dehydration (LSH, KCl-Salt1, and EHR) from the
salt tolerant rootstock, Cleopatra, the sensitive hybrid,
Carrizo and the sensitive scion, Navelina [27,28].

The unigene consensus sequences were used as queries in
a BLASTN search against a database including 130400
ESTs from Citrus species retrieved from GenBank. An e
value of 1e-13 was used as a cut off to ensure that only
almost identical sequences were detected. The results
showed that more than 5159 unigenes (33%) did not produce a significant hit, indicating that these sequences had
not previously been described in Citrus EST collections.
However, the possibility that other parts of the same
parental genes were present in these collections can not be
discarded. Most novel sequences (4673) were derived
from the normalized library and might represent transcripts expressed at very low levels. This idea was supported by the fact that 75% of these sequences were
singletons. On the other hand, no major divergences or
differences at the sequence level were observed between

all Citrus species analyzed, including the five cultivars
used in this study and those with sequences submitted to
GenBank (C. sinensis, Citrus × paradisi, and C. unshiu,
mainly).
The analysis of the contigs (Fig 1B) indicated that many of
them were composed of ESTs from a single library (67%),
while only 195 contigs (2%) included ESTs from 4 or
more libraries. The unigene Contig6498 that displayed
high similarity with ATPase-like proteins, for example,
was found in 7 libraries, although it was composed of
only 9 ESTs. The number of exclusive unigenes of a given
cDNA library was obtained adding the number of singletons and the contigs composed of ESTs from this library
(Table 1). It was determined that 11432 (72.9%) clusters
were exclusive of a particular library. The standard cDNA
libraries provided ~21% of the assembled ESTs while the
number of exclusive clusters from these libraries represented more than 26% of the unigenes.
Sequence Annotation
Annotation of the assembled sequences was initially
based on primary sequence homology searches. A BLASTX
search performed against the GenBank non redundant
protein database [32] with an e value cut off ≤ 1e-10,
yielded 13339 unigenes with significant hits. A number of
4541 protein homologs were annotated as unknown,
unnamed, hypothetical or expressed proteins.

BLASTX searches were also performed against the complete protein sets of Arabidopsis thaliana [33] and Oryza
sativa [34]. The results were similar, since 12336 and

11996 significant hits were found in Arabidopsis and rice,
respectively. BLAST results were parsed, determining for
each Citrus unigene, the best hit name and description,
the extent of the aligned region, the percentage of similarity and the e value. Sequences were classified based on the
ORF conservation: 5595 unigenes had very high similarities (80%–100%), 5729 clusters showed high similarities
(60 – 80%), while only 1883 unigenes had moderate similarities (40%–60%) and 132 sequences displayed low
similarities (30%–40%). No similarities below 30% were
obtained. These results indicated that a large number of
unigenes (40%) had a very strong match (sequence conservation ≥ 80%) with the top-score hit of the BLASTX
results.
The extent of the region of similarity between a given unigene and its best hit protein was also determined, including all High-scoring Segment Pairs (HSPs) for one hit. To
this end, the following assumptions were taken: when
similarity regions expanded along the complete length of
the hit protein, unigenes were supposed to include a complete ORF; if HSPs matched the amino-terminal region of
the hit sequence, the cDNA clones from which these ESTs
were derived probably contained a complete mRNA partially sequenced; finally, when HSPs located at the carboxy-terminal region of the hit protein, cDNA clones were
assumed to correspond to truncated mRNAs. The Citrus
unigenes were classified according to these criteria, resulting in 4065 complete ORFs, 6082 complete cDNA clones,
and 4132 partial or truncated cDNA clones. Taken
together the complete ORFs and clones, the Citrus EST collection contained at least, 10147 complete cDNA clones.

The species of the best hit sequences produced in the
BLASTX search against the non redundant database were
registered and classified (data not shown). Not surprisingly, 7725 hits (55.2%) corresponded to A. thaliana and
2610 (18.6%) to other eudicots species. About 400 unigenes produced significant best hits from species other
than plants (mainly bacteria, fungi, and insects), with a
high degree of conservation (= 80%). 298 of these clusters
had no significant hits from Arabidopsis or rice, and a
BLASTN search performed against the non redundant and
EST GenBank databases, confirmed they might be contaminant sequences not originated from Citrus species.
A considerable number of sequences (10 to 15%) did not
produce a significant hit in the BLAST searches performed.
The correlation between the number of sequences that
produced no hits and the length of the unigene (Fig 2),
showed that 607 out of 954 sequences shorter than 500
bp (63%) did not produce a significant hit, while the percentage was only 7% for longer sequences (1067out of
14710 unigenes). Since the BLASTX searches were performed against protein databases, the high number of no
hits found for the clusters shorter than 500 bp, may indicate that these regions did not contain coding sequences,
corresponding to mRNA UTRs. The absence of significant
hits was certainly not due to low quality of the shorter

sequences, because the level of similarity of the unigenes
was always high regardless the size of the sequence (Fig 2),
indicating that shorter sequences had the same quality
than longer ones.
The sequences that did not produce significant hits were
used as queries in a BLASTN search performed against the
GenBank non redundant nucleotide database [32]. Only
40 unigenes produced significant hits showing high similarity levels (80 – 100%). A total of 24 sequences presented similarity with the complete sequence of Poncirus
trifoliata Citrus tristeza virus resistance gene locus, the only
genomic BAC clone (282699 bp long) from a Citrus species that has been sequenced [35].
The same set of unigenes produced 647 significant hits
(conserved region longer than 100 bp and similarity ≥
80%) in a further BLASTN search against the GenBank EST
database [32], indicating that similar transcripts were previously isolated. Further analysis showed that most of the
hits derived only from Citrus species, suggesting that these
clusters might be putative Citrus exclusive genes.
Protein translation and annotation
A search for domains associated with a Hidden Markov
Model profile was intended to improve annotation of the
EST collection. To obtain better templates for annotation,
the translation of the unigenes consensus sequences into
polypeptide ones was carried out with the prot4EST prediction pipeline, which produces robust translations from
EST sequences [36]. A BLASTP search was performed with
the polypeptide sequences against the GenBank protein
database [32], and 77% of them produced the same hit
than the original DNA sequences, showing the accuracy of
the translations. All polypeptides shorter than 30 aa, and

Page 5 of 22

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:31

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/31

those shorter than 100 aa without a significant hit were
discarded, and the final number of useful protein translations was 14782. The parsing of the BLASTP results confirmed that the unigenes initially classified as complete
ORFs coded for complete proteins.
Once protein sequences were obtained and tested,
searches against pattern or signature databases were performed. The InterPro database was chosen for these
searches, as it unites secondary databases that contain
overlapping information on protein families, domains
and functional sites [37]. The standalone version of the
interProScan tool, that combines the protein function recognition methods of the member databases of InterPro
into one application, was used for the analysis. The total
number of unigenes that produced hits and the number of
different motifs identified varied highly depending on the
database size and the analysis method. Motif search
against the Pfam database produced the largest number of
protein hits (7141) and also identified a high number of
different motifs (1666). Table 2 shows the 20 most abundant conserved domains found with Pfam. These motifs
were responsible of the 34% of the total hits. Further analysis was carried out on the subset of 2482 proteins predicted as complete with the BLASTX analyses that
produced Pfam hits (Table 3). Most of the proteins,
76.15%, displayed a single type of functional domain;
proteins combining 2 different motifs accounted for the

20.43%, while polypeptides with 3 or 4 different conserved domains were in a low number (3.42%).
Gene Ontology Annotation
The Gene Ontology (GO) annotation of the Citrus unigene set was performed with BLAST2GO (B2G) [38]. B2G
assigns GO annotations through a 3-steps procedure:
BLAST against protein databases, retrieval of all GO annotations for a specified number of BLAST hits (Mapping),
and GO assignment through an evaluated annotation rule
(Annotation). Figure 3A shows the intensity of GO annotation. A total of 10842 unigenes were annotated with
39173 annotations, distributed among the main Gene
Ontology categories: Biological Process (11868), Molecular Function (14686) and Cellular Component (12604).
There were 5515 sequences annotated with all three GO
categories, and 8576 that had at least two annotations.
Failure in GO term assignment was due to either a negative result in the BLAST search (NoBLAST, 53%), the
absence of GO annotation in any of the BLAST hits
(NoMapping, 7%) or because the sequence did not fulfil
quality parameters of trustable annotation (NoAnnotation, 40%) (Figure 3B). Noteworthy was that most of
these last 47% of sequences, i.e., sequences with a BLAST
result without GO term assignment, had best BLAST hits
to unknown or hypothetical proteins, indicating the
uncertainty in the functional characterization of the hit
sequences.

To provide a general representation of the distribution of
Citrus gene ontology annotation, the Slim GO Classification for Plants developed at TAIR [33] was obtained, and
sets of genes according to broad GO ontology categories
were produced [39]. All functional categories in the Biological Processes classification were well represented in
the Citrus unigene set (Figure 4). Similar results were
obtained in the other main GO classes, Molecular function and Cellular Localization (data not shown).
Characterizing the Citrus Gene Space
In an attempt to characterize the Citrus gene space, a first
analysis was performed to study the biological context of
the novel unigenes. Further studies were addressed to
identify candidate genes for molecular markers, gene
duplications and conserved gene families.
Novelty and biological context
The results presented in this work identified more than
5159 sequences that had not been included before in any
Citrus EST collection, and could be, therefore, novel Citrus
unigenes. Most of these sequences were derived from the
normalized full-length library (4673), that contained a
mixed of reproductive and vegetative tissues particularly
enriched with fruit tissues, abscission zones and salinity

samples. Thus, the unigene set of this library probably
included many low abundant transcripts related to several
physiological and developmental processes, including
fruit quality, productivity and salinity, the targets of this
study. Interestingly, 20% of these novel unigenes corresponded to unknown proteins. The number of novel unigenes included into standard libraries was 486, while 148
of them were annotated as unknown genes. To estimate
the input of the standard libraries in terms of gene novelty, sets of unigenes known (or assumed) to be involved
in the three processes of interest were selected and the
libraries containing them identified.
Fruit quality includes many physical attributes and chemical characteristics of the fruit, such as sugar and acid content, flavour and aroma compounds (organoleptic
properties). In addition, Citrus fruits contain an extensive
array of secondary compounds with pivotal nutritional
properties. These traits that are acquired along fruit
growth are controlled by primary, intermediate, and secondary metabolic pathways. In order to identify genes
with relevant roles in fruit quality, homologs of structural
enzymes from some of these pivotal metabolic pathways
were searched in Citrus. The pathways of known topology
involved in the biosynthesis of flavonoids and their pre-

cursors, the glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, the oxydative/nonoxydative pentose phosphate pathway, the aromatic
aminoacid pathway and the general phenyl propanoid
and flavonoid pathways were targeted. To identify the Citrus unigenes that putatively coded for structural enzymes
of the selected pathways, the EC number [40] of the Citrus
predicted proteins was determined. The results indicated
that these pathways were fully represented (Table 4), and
that most putative enzymatic activities were present with
a significant degree of redundancy, both in terms of EST
(expression) and Unigenes (putative paralogs) numbers.
From a total of 220 unigenes (1026 ESTs) related to the
enzymatic activities of the pathways analyzed in Table 4,
it was found that about 15% of them corresponded to
novel unigenes. For example, 7 out of the 12 unigenes
assigned to the fructose 1,6 biphosphate aldolase activity
in the glycolitic pathway are described in this work for the
first time. Furthermore, 36% of the 58 enzymatic activities
implicated in the processes displayed novel unigenes.
The lignin biosynthesis pathway was analyzed in detail,
since lignin is an important component of the dietary
fiber present in the fruit [41], that has important benefits

for human health [42,43]. This pathway has been recently
described in Arabidopsis thaliana [44,45], and is also found
at the AraCyc database [33]. ESTs with significant similarity to any of the Arabidopsis enzymes involved in this
route were selected and reassembled with the Staden
Gap4 program [46]. The number of unigenes was estimated by considering only those contigs showing non
identical consensus sequences that overlapped significantly. For each enzymatic activity described in the lignin
pathway a phylogenetic analysis that included the A. thaliana and Citrus proteins was carried out. These analyses
redefined the number of Citrus unigenes that could be
considered orthologs of the Arabidopsis genes. The
number of Citrus ESTs and Unigenes related to the Arabidopsis proteins of the lignin pathway are shown in Table
5. All the enzymatic activities involved in this pathway
were represented, and for 8 particular Arabidopsis proteins, Citrus possessed 2, 3 or even 5 orthologs according
to the phylogenetic analysis A search for enzymes of this
pathway performed on the annotation database of the
draft sequence of the genome of Populus trichocarpa [47],
produced similar results, with 22 gene models assigned to
the 4-coumarate coenzyme A ligase activity, and 5 gene

These data suggest that multiple orthologs of all Arabidopsis lignin proteins could be apparently found if
enough number of Citrus ESTs were analyzed, indicating
the relevance of the lignification process in Citrus. The
comparison of the unigenes involved in lignin biosynthesis (Table 5) against Citrus ESTs from GenBank, showed
that 7 out of the 22 orthologs produced not hits, indicating that they were novel genes reported in this work for
the first time.
Additional new unigenes implicated in fruit quality were
selected based on published information [18,19,48] from
relevant pathways of lipids and fatty acid metabolism and
degradation [GenBank:DY258371, GenBank:DY258372,
GenBank:DY258373, GenBank:DY258374, Contig0424,

Contig4271, GenBank:DY258401, GenBank:DY258402],
and chlorophyll synthesis [GenBank:DY258395]. The
analyses indicated that 64% of these novel genes were
found in the normalized library, while 14 % of them were
isolated from FruitTF, one of the two fruit specific libraries. The other unigenes belonged to stress and abscission
libraries.
The analysis of genes related to productivity was initially
focused in 3 families that had been previously associated
with the abscission process, the auxin responsive factors
(9 novel unigenes), the receptor protein kinases (35 novel
unigenes) and the EREBP (ethylene responsive element
binding protein, 4 novel unigenes). The results showed
that only one singleton [GenBank:EH405902] of the first
family, Contig5401 of the second and Contig5227 of the
third one, derived from standard abscission libraries
(AbsAOv1, AbsDev, and AbsCOv1), while the remaining
members (45), were isolated from the normalized library.
Since many of the processes implicated in abscission are
controlled by the selective removal of short-lived regula-

tory proteins, we also analyzed the occurrence of the ubiquitin/26S proteasome pathway [49] among the novel
sequences. This component, deeply involved in protein
degradation, has not yet been related to abscission and,
therefore, no previous information is available in this
regard. Interestingly, the only member of E2s Ub-conjugating enzymes [GenBank:DY258370] found in the set of
novel unigenes was detected in the AbsDev library. In
addition, 4 members out of 23 E3s Ub-ligases [Contigs
5267 and 5546, GenBank:DY257277 and GenBank:DY258093], were exclusively obtained from the
abscission-related libraries. These putative unigenes may
participate in the removal of repressor elements during
the organ separation [23,50,51]. The other Ub-ligases
were mostly present in the normalized library. Several cell
wall structural proteins [GenBank:DY256701, GenGenBank:DY258445
and
GenBank:DY257041,
Bank:DY258901] and two specific glycosyl hydrolases
[GenBank:DY257803 and GenBank:DY258004] were
exclusive of the abscission-related libraries, suggesting
that abscission may also implicate active remodelling of
cell walls [52]. Aside from the normalized library, the
abscission libraries that were strongly enriched with specific abscission zone tissues, showed a relatively high
number of novel exclusive unigenes (162).
For the analyses of novel citrus genes potentially involved
in abiotic stress, the following well established biological
functions were investigated: sodium Na+/H+ antiporters
[GenBank:DY258370, GenBank:DY305688 and GenBank:DY300954], that are probably involved in sodium

specific phospholipase C [GenBank:DY260755] and the

and the membrane-associated salt-inducible protein
[GenBank:DY301464]. Moreover, the following biological functions related to acclimatization to osmotic shock
were searched: two different NCED4 genes involved in
ABA biosynthesis (Contig0189 and Contig0309) [24];
and two genes involved in trehalose metabolism [GenBank:DY280731 and GenBank:DY294040]. Lastly, cell
tolerance mechanisms universally linked to different abiotic stresses, represented by heat shock proteins and
molecular chaperons [GenBank:DY261699, GenGenBank:DY303256,

and

uncharacterized stress-responsive genes [Contig0907,
and
GenContig2771,
GenBank:DY270558
Bank:DY260600] were also analyzed. The results of this
search indicated that 42% of these abiotic stress related
genes were detected in the normalized library, while 34 %
of them was found in fruit libraries (FruitTF and PhIIIIIVesicles1). Only 1 unigene, a putative sodium Na+/H+
antiporter [GenBank:DY305688], was found as a singleton in a salinity-related library, LSH, whereas only
Contig5589 (Calcineurin B gene) contained ESTs exclusively derived from KCl-Salt1, another salinity library.
Overall, these preliminary estimates showed that most of
the novel genes, presumably implicated in fruit quality,
abscission, and salinity responses, were effectively recovered in the normalized library. The contribution of the
fruit and abscission libraries to the set of unigenes related
to fruit quality or abscission, could be roughly estimated
between 5 and 15%. The lower contribution of the salinity
standard libraries (less than 5%) may be due to the abundance of unspecific cross-responses among multiple abiotic and biotic stresses. For an accurate estimation of these
figures, however, confirmation of gene specificity appears
to be mandatory.
Molecular markers
The use of genetic and molecular markers is crucial to
facilitate the identification and cloning of genes of agronomic interest [57], while single copy genes are usually
good candidates to be used as markers. To identify conserved A. thaliana orthologs present as single copy genes
in both Arabidopsis and Citrus, a database with 3700 Arabidopsis single copy genes was obtained from the Compositae Genome Project Database [58], and used in a
BLAST search with the Citrus unigene set as queries. A total
of 726 Citrus sequences showed an unambiguous single
strong BLAST hit, and reciprocal BLAST searches (Arabidopsis single copy genes versus the EST assemblies) pro-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/31

duced the same results. The outcome of this BLAST search
was compared with that obtained in the BLAST search performed against all Citrus ESTs from GenBank. The results
showed that 129 unigenes did not generate any hit, while
445 clusters only produced hits with similarities higher
than 95%, suggesting that these were ESTs probably
derived from the same transcript. Although this analysis is
not conclusive, the absence of hits or the occurrence of
extremely high similarities, suggested that these 574 unigenes are strong candidates to be conserved orthologs of
Arabidopsis single copy genes.
Gene duplications
The BLAST search with the Arabidopsis single copy genes
also produced 234 sequences with 2 or more strong Citrus
hits. These cases were further investigated as they might be
indicative of gene duplication events produced in the Citrus genome. In many cases, Unigenes showing the same
Arabidopsis hit did not overlap, indicating that they may
derive from the same transcript but were not assembled in
the same contig, and therefore cannot be considered to be
different genes. Finally, 18 Arabidopsis single copy genes
showed strong similarity with two overlapping Citrus unigenes. These clusters presented the same Arabidopsis protein as their best hit, supporting the hypothesis that they
are paralog genes in Citrus [see Additional file 1].
Gene Family analysis
Comparative genomics was used to characterize the conserved gene families in A. thaliana and Citrus species.
There are currently 930 gene families, comprising 6399
genes, described at the Arabidopsis thaliana Information
Resource database [59]. The presence of these gene families in the Citrus unigene set was explored, allocating the
Citrus clusters in the gene families based on the best Arabidopsis significant hit obtained. About 3000 Citrus unigenes were assigned to 724 families, and 52 super
families, showing that 78% and 92% of the Arabidopsis
families and superfamilies were represented in the Citrus
EST collection. To exemplify the potential for Citrus
improvement of the information included in the EST collection, two gene families with relevant agronomic interest were selected and analyzed in detail: the ammonium
transporter family intimately related to plant nutritional
efficiency and the glycoside hydrolase family 20, implicated in sugar synthesis in fruit.

The Arabidopis high-affinity ammonium transporter family is composed of six members: five proteins that form
the AtAMT1 subfamily [60] and a member, AtAMT2, that
is distantly related to the AtAMT1 subfamily [61]. Similarity searches showed that 60 Citrus ESTS were significantly
similar to the Arabidopsis ammonium transporters. These
ESTs that corresponded to 6 unigenes (4 contigs and 2 singletons) were translated into protein with prot4EST. A

multiple alignment of the A. thaliana and Citrus sequences
was performed with Clustal X, and a phylogenetic tree was
constructed with the neighbor joining method (Figure
5A). The tree showed that 3 Citrus unigenes closely related
to AtAMT2 grouped together in a cluster supported by very
high bootstrap values. Thus, the AMT2 subfamily of
ammonium transporters in Citrus comprised, at least, 3
proteins, suggesting the occurrence of a number of duplication events.
Glycosyltransferase family 20 is composed of proteins
with known α, α-trehalose-phosphate synthase UDPforming activity, and in A. thaliana comprises proteins
At1G05590 and At3G55260. A total of 15 Citrus ESTs displaying significant similarity with the glycosyltransferase
family 20 proteins were assembled into 4 unigenes
grouped in 2 contigs and 2 singletons. As above, phylogenetic analysis showed that the Citrus and Arabidopsis proteins clustered together, with high bootstrap values
supporting the clade (Figure 5B). This analysis suggests
that the glycosyltransferase family 20 included 4 members
in Citrus species while in A. thaliana it contained only two
proteins.

Discussion
Citrus is the main fruit tree crop in the world. However,
traditional breeding for Citrus cultivar improvement faces
many serious impediments due to the unusual combination of biological characteristics of Citrus, their low
genetic diversity and the long-term nature of tree breeding. Genomic technology can overcome these limitations
providing new tools, for example, to produce more efficient varieties and rootstocks and to identify new genes,
alleles or genotypes of agronomic relevance. Improvement of knowledge of the transcriptome is one of the first
tasks that have to be developed in order to understand the
developmental biology of the plants and how these
respond to environmental stresses. This work that pursues
this goal provides a deep insight into the Citrus transcriptome specifically related to three major commercial traits
i.e improved fruit quality, higher yield and tolerance to
environmental stresses, especially salinity.
Towards this objective, 10 cDNA libraries representing
particular treatments and tissues from selected varieties
and rootstocks differing in fruit quality, resistance to
abscission and tolerance to salinity were generated to provide a large and enriched expressed sequence tag collection. The assembly of these sequences, more than 52600
ESTs, allowed the identification of 15660 transcription
units. The results of this analysis are comparable to previous reports in Solanum tuberosum, that detected 19892
unigenes from 61949 ESTs [62], or in Sorghum bicolor,
with 16801 unique transcripts derived from 55783 ESTs
[63]. The data showed that all sequences from the Citrus
species analyzed, from both this study and databases,
were almost identical, suggesting that the differential
behaviour of these cultivars during normal fruit growth or
when facing environmental adverse conditions is more
likely associated with differences in gene regulation rather
than with sequence divergence. This result is not unexpected since Citrus posses a high level of phenotypic diversity while global genetic diversity, analyzed with
molecular markers, appears to be very low or practically
null. A large effort was made to determine the real number
of different transcripts represented in the EST collection. It
is well known that the accuracy of EST clustering is
affected by various error sources, such as sequencing mistakes, contaminant sequences and the presence of products of chimeric splicing. The most common error occurs
when different ESTs from the same gene are falsely separated into two or more clusters [64]. To overcome this difficulty the level of redundancy was estimated comparing
all unigenes with each other, and clustering them in supercontigs, that are more likely to correspond to real transcripts. The level of redundancy was estimated to be 26%,
a value similar to that obtained in sugarcane, for example
[65]. This first restriction suggests that the likely number

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:31

of unigenes in the Citrus collection is closer to 13900
rather than to 15660.
It was also crucial to determine the occurrence of contaminant sequences, mostly from microorganisms, since
many samples were taken from open field. The presence
of contaminant sequences (mainly from bacteria and
fungi) is a general problem not attended in any of the EST
projects we have examined. For instances, a BLASTN
search performed with several contaminant sequences
found in this work against the viridiplantae section of the
GenBank EST database revealed a considerable number of
ESTs regarded as plant sequences that really corresponded
to fungi species (data not shown). Thus, the analysis
reported in this work may help to prevent the presence of
sequences from contaminant species in the databases.
Determining the species of the unigenes best hit
sequences helped to identify putative contaminants,
allowing not only a more precise estimation of the real
number of Citrus transcripts but also criteria for microarray EST selection. Since about 400 Unigenes were
believed to be contaminant sequences from other species,
the number of Citrus expressed genes was reduced to
13500.
A relevant observation of this work is that more than 38%
of the 13500 unigenes (5159 sequences) are novel Citrus
unigenes. EST sequences were obtained from two kinds of
cDNA libraries, normalized full length and standard
libraries. The normalized library was generated with a
wide variety of reproductive and vegetative tissues,
enriched with developing fruits, abscission zones and
salinity samples. In the first strategy, the normalization
process very effectively increased low abundant transcripts, since the bulk of the novel unigenes described
(4673) derived from this library. The standard libraries
that were constructed from either samples of fruits, abscission zones or salt-treated organs, were generated with the
idea of providing transcripts specifically expressed at these
particular tissues and organs without increasing redundancy. To estimate the contribution of the standard libraries in terms of gene novelty, a set of unigenes presumably
involved in the three processes of interest was selected and
the libraries containing them identified. Although for an
accurate evaluation of these contributions confirmation
of tissue specificity appears to be mandatory, these preliminary estimates showed that most of the novel genes
were certainly recovered in the normalized library. Moreover, the contribution of the specific standard libraries to
the unigene set maybe roughly estimated to be between 4
and 15%.
The primary homology searches performed against different databases allowed annotation of most unigenes, with
more than 73% of them displaying a similarity degree

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/31

higher than 60%. These results agreed those obtained in
previous Citrus [12] or sugarcane [65] EST projects. It was
also shown that most of the sequences that did not produce significant hits in the BLASTX searches were shorter
than 500 bp (Fig 2) and probably did not carry coding
sequences. Additional efforts were performed to characterize these sequences, with supplementary BLASTN
searches against the non redundant and EST nucleotide
databases. These analyses gave rise to the suggestion that
647 ESTs of the Citrus unigene set may correspond to Citrus exclusive genes since the significant hits they produced
were only for Citrus sequences, in spite of the more than
8.5 million EST sequences derived from plant species
deposited at the GenBank,
Further improvement of the annotation was carried out
through searches performed against secondary databases,
composed of patterns or signatures. Although these prediction methods can work with DNA sequences, the error
prone nature of ESTs, mainly shifts in the reading frame
(missing or inserted bases) or ambiguous bases, may
result in inaccuracies and loss of information. Thus, a crucial step in annotation is the robust translation of the ESTs
to yield predicted polypeptides. Polypeptide sequences
posses a better template for almost all annotation tools,
including InterPro and Pfam, and allow the assembly of
more accurate multiple sequence alignments. High quality polypeptide predictions can be applied to functional
annotation and post-genomic study in a similar way to
those available for completed genomes. In the work presented here, the protein translation was performed with
Prot4EST, a prediction pipeline that incorporates freely
available software (ESTscan, Decoder, HSP tiling) to produce final translations that are more accurate than those
derived from any single method [36]. The use of the interProScan tool [37], allowed simultaneous search for motifs
against 9 databases. This search produced significant
results for almost 11000 predicted proteins, including
342 unigenes that did not have significant hits in the
BLAST searches. From the 20 most abundant motifs found
in Citrus with Pfam, 7 of them also were included in the
top 20 list at the Pfam database, enforcing the accuracy of
the analysis and the representativity of the Citrus EST collection. The molecular functions associated with these 20
motifs can be grouped in 4 categories: protein-protein
interaction (47.26%), nucleic acid binding (27.51%),
protein modification and binding (14.9%), and calcium
metabolism (6.17%), which indicates the relative significance of these cellular functions in Citrus.
The distribution of motifs on the polypeptide sequences
predicted to be complete proteins showed that the bulk of
sequences displayed a single motif (76%). Proteins carrying 2 ore more motifs showed unlike signatures rather
than repeats of the same motif. For instance, the number

Page 15 of 22
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:31

of proteins with 2 different signatures (452) was six times
higher than the number of proteins that had 2 identical
motifs (69). Similar relationships were found for other
number of repeats.
The Gene Ontology annotation of the Citrus unigenes was
performed with BLAST2GO (B2G), a recently developed
BLAST-based GO annotation software [38]. The B2G
approach uses multiple BLAST hits to search for functional annotations and assigns GO terms to the query
sequence applying an annotation algorithm that considers HSP length, e-value, percentage of similarity, Evidence
Code of the source annotations and the topology of the
Gene Ontology. This is in contrast to most EST projects
that perform annotation solely by direct assignment of the
GO terms to the best hit of BLAST searches [12,66,67]. The
B2G method has shown to have a high annotation recall
and has been used in other EST projects in eukaryotes
[68].
Metabolic pathways responsible of important agronomic
traits were further surveyed to determine the extent of representation of these pathways within the Citrus unigene
set. In addition to the finding that most enzymatic steps
were represented by Citrus homologs, a preliminary estimate of gene duplication based on the occurrence of paralogous sequences was also provided. Defining such
relationships and understanding functional diversification of paralogs is an important field of research in
genomics-assisted crop improvement. Lignin biosynthetic
pathway was the object of a deeper analysis since Citrus
fruits are very rich in products with beneficial effects in
preventing cancer, diabetes, ...etc such as fiber [42,69].
Dietary fiber, that consists of non digested structural and
storage polysaccharides and lignin, lowers cholesterol levels and helps to normalize blood glucose and insulin levels [70]. The detailed analysis of lignin biosynthesis
pathway, carried out in Citrus, indicated that in comparison with Arabidopis, Citrus possessed at least 9 additional
enzymatic activities involved in lignin synthesis (Table 5).
Furthermore, the results obtained for gene models from
Populus trichocarpa [47], also appears to support the idea
that the extensive formation of secondary xylem in tree
species, requiring high levels of lignin synthesis may have
been the origin of the expansion of the genes involved in
this pathway.
More than 570 unigenes have been suggested to be possible conserved orthologs of Arabidopsis single copy genes.
Recent studies have indicated that ancient polyploidy is
common across angiosperm lineages and in fact, the
genomes of all angiosperms may have been influenced by
at least one genome-wide duplication event [71]. Despite
such events, single-copy, apparently orthologous gene sets
have been identified in a broad range of angiosperms

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/31

[72,73]. Selection against duplicates may be maintaining
these genes as single copy, and therefore are precious
markers for comparative genetic and physical mapping,
and also for phylogenetic analyses [74]. Identification of
such genes in Citrus species is mandatory to perform this
kind of analyses [75]. The study also revealed a number of
genes that might be duplicated in the Citrus genome,
while remained as single copy genes in Arabidopsis,
although the possibility of finding additional copies of
these genes could not be discarded, when the whole transcriptome of Citrus is available. If these duplications are
the result of individual events or were caused by a
genome-wide duplication cannot be answered with the
current information.
Comparative genomics was also used to obtain an overview of conserved gene families in Citrus. All Arabidopsis
gene families studied were well represented in the Citrus
EST collection, although the number of their members
was generally smaller, probably because the unigene set
was only a partial representation. For the same reason, the
finding of families that in Citrus clearly outnumbered
their Arabidopsis counterparts is highly significant. The
phylogenomic analysis performed on the gene families of
ammonium transporters and glycosyltransferases supported this idea confirming the occurrence of additional
members in the Citrus families. Ammonium is one of the
prevalent nitrogen sources for growth and development of
higher plants including Citrus. The ammonium transporter family is composed in Arabidopsis of 5 AMT1
related genes and AMT2, which is more closely related to
ammonium transporters from prokaryotes than to AMT1.
AtAMT2 is likely to play a significant role in moving
ammonium between the apoplast and symplast of cells
throughout the plant [61]. Interestingly, there are three
AMT2 like genes in Citrus (Fig 6A). Glycosyltransferases
are a ubiquitous group of enzymes that catalyse the transfer of a sugar moiety from an activated sugar donor onto
saccharide or non-saccharide acceptors. Although many
glycosyltransferases catalyse chemically similar reactions,
they display remarkable diversity in their donor, acceptor
and product specificity and thereby generate a potentially
infinite number of glycoconjugates, oligo- and polysaccharides. [76]. Thus, the additional members found in
this family, might be related to the complexity of sugar
synthesis that takes place in the Citrus fruits.

Conclusion
The assembly of more than 54000 Citrus ESTs from five
cultivars differing in basic fruit developmental aspects,
such as major traits for fruit quality and production, and
in the responses to environmental conditions, provides an
unprecedented insight of the Citrus transcriptome. This
study contributes new tools for Citrus genetic and
genomic analyses. The unigene set, composed of ~13000

Page 16 of 22

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:31

putative different transcripts, including more than 5000
novel Citrus genes, was assigned with putative functions
based on similarity, GO annotations and protein
domains. In addition, comparative genomics was used to
analyze the Citrus transcriptome, and evidences for
numerous cases of gene duplication events were presented. The similarity analyses indicated that the
sequences of the genes belonging to the varieties and rootstocks studied were essentially identical suggesting that
the differential behaviour of these species cannot be
attributed to main sequence divergences. This set of processed EST sequences has greatly contributed to the development of a new Citrus microarray.

Methods
1. Plant material
The Citrus genotypes used to generate the cDNA libraries
were the varieties Citrus clementina, (cv Clementina de
Nules), and C. sinensis (cvs Navelina and Washington
Navel), and the rootstocks C. reshni (cv Cleopatra mandarin) and C. sinenis × Poncirus trifoliata (cv Carrizo citrange). Their characteristics are as follows. Clementine is
a mandarin of elevated fruit quality, high ovary and fruitlet abscission and moderate salt tolerance. Washington
Navel is a late sweet orange that generally shows pre-harvest abscission. In contrast, Navelina, an early orange variety, exhibits low fruit abscission but higher salt sensitivity.
Cleopatra mandarin is an efficient salt tolerant rootstock
while the hybrid Carrizo citrange shows high salt sensitive).
2. Normalized Full Length Library (NFL)
Tissue Samples and Treatments Description
All samples included in the normalized full-length library
were harvested from Citrus clementina (cv Clementina de
Nules). They were composed of the following tissues and
organs: developing vegetative tips and buds, dormant
buds, developing leaves, shoots, internodes and roots,
abscission zones from leaves, flowers, ovaries and fruits,
flowers and inflorescences, growing and senescent ovaries, developing fruitlets (stages I & II), flavedo from growing, ripening and, senescent fruits and fruit flesh (juice
sacs, stages I, II & III). The library also included leaves subjected to different treatments: short- and long-term salinity, drought and rehydration, mineral deficiencies,
alkaline and calcareous soils, low and high temperature,
flooding, oxidative stress, wounding, insect attacks, and
elicitors (harpin) treatments. All tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen and equal amounts of homogenized tissues
were mixed in a single sample for total RNA extraction.
Library Construction
Full-length cDNA synthesis was carried out with Invitrogen proprietary RNase H reduction reverse transcriptase
"cocktail" for mRNA isolation, 5' cap full-length enrich-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/31

ment, and the reduction of oligo(dT)-priming. Normalization was carried out by self-subtraction, with Invitrogen
technology, as described by manufacturer. Normalization
produced a 24 fold average reduction of the abundant
clones, (from 0.16% abundance to 0.0065%).
PCMVSport6.1 was used as a cloning vector.
3. Standard Libraries
Tissue Samples and Treatments Description
- Fruit-TF: parthenocarpic fruits of Citrus clementina (cv
Clementina de Nules) mandarin were harvested from
adult trees grown grafted onto Carrizo citrange rootstock
(Citrus sinensis × Poncirus trifoliata) in a homogeneous
orchard under normal culture practices. Flavedo (exocarp) samples were isolated from fruits collected on July
28 (69 days post anthesis, dpa), July 24 (85 dpa), August
2 (94 dpa), October 11 (164 dpa), November 18 (202
dpa), November 25 (209 dpa), December 13 (227 dpa)
and January 9 (254 dpa). Samples of fruit flesh, consisting
of juice vesicles (endocarp) including the segments with
their membranes and vascular bundles, were taken from
fruits collected on May 13 (13 dpa) and June 10 (41 dpa).
Samples were frozen under liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 \circC until RNA isolation. Mixtures of equal amounts
of poly-A+ RNA from the samples were used.

- PhII-IIIVesicles1: fruit juice vesicles from Clementine
grafted onto Carrizo citrange were taken at one month
intervals: July 8 (69 dpa), August 2 (94 dpa), September
12 (135 dpa), October 16 (169 dpa), November 14 (198
dpa) and December 17 (231 dpa). A mixture of equal
amounts of poly-A+ RNA from the six samples was used.
- AbsDev: laminar abscission zone and surrounding tissues (petiole and blade) of developing leaves were harvested from Clementine on Carrizo citrange.
- AbsCFruit1: abscission zone C and surrounding tissues
of ripe fruits were harvested from Citrus sinensis (cv. Washington navel) scions on Carrizo.
- AbsCOv: abscission zone C and surrounding tissues of
ethylene-treated ovary explants were harvested from
Clementinescions on Carrizo.
- AbsAOv1: abscission zone A and surrounding tissues of
ethylene-treated ovary explants at "petal fall" stage were
harvested from Clementine scions on Carrizo.
- LSH: leaves were harvested from one-year-old Citrus sinensis (cv Navelina) scions grafted onto Cleopatra (Citrus
reshni) rootstock cultured under salinity conditions. Potted plants were grown in greenhouse conditions and subjected to regular irrigations (three times per week) with 25
mM NaCl:CaCl2 solutions for 60 days.

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:31

- KCl-Salt1: non-suberized roots, enriched in distal
(actively growing) root portions were harvested from 1
year-old Cleopatra mandarin seedlings. Potted plants
grown in greenhouse conditions were subjected to Cl-starvation and resupply treatments at different times with 50
and 100 mM KCl.
- EHR: young roots from Carrizo citrange were collected 3,
6, 12, and 24 hours after water stress treatment and 1, 6,
and 10 hours after re-watering. A mixture of equal
amounts of poly-A+ RNA from the different samples was
used.
RNA Extraction
For AbsDev, AbsCFRuit1, AbsCOv1, AbsAOv1, and EHR
libraries, total RNA was isolated from frozen tissue using
the standard guanidine protocol [77]. For FruitTF library,
total RNA was isolated from frozen tissue using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) and treated with RNase-free
DNase (Qiagen) through column purification according
to the manufacturer's instructions. For KCL-Salt1 library,
total RNA was isolated from frozen tissue using acid phenol extraction and Lithium Chloride precipitation
method [78]. In all cases, RNA quality was assessed by
espectrophotometry and gel electrophoresis [77].
Poly(A)+ RNA Isolation
Poly(A)+RNA was isolated from a mixture of equal
amounts of total RNA from all samples using the Oligotex
mRNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer's
instructions.
Construction protocols and cloning vectors
KCl-Salt1, AbsDev, AbsCFruit1, and FruitTF cDNA libraries were constructed using the CloneMiner cDNA Library
Construction Kit (Invitrogen) with the pDONRTM222
vector. AbsCOv1, AbsAOv1, and EHR cDNA libraries were
constructed with SMART cDNA Library Construction Kit
(Clontech) and pTriplEx2 as the cloning vector. SLH
library was constructed with Stratagene cDNA synthesis
kit and the pBluescript SK (-) vector. PhII-III-Vesicles1,
and EHR libraries were constructed using the UNI-ZAP XR
and Gigapack III Gold kits from Stratagene and ë-ZAP II
cloning vector.
4. EST assembly and annotation
DNA templates were prepared using the 96-well alkaline
lysis DNA method. Sequencing was performed using the
ABI Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequence Ready Reaction as
described by manufacturer, with the T7 forward primer in
96 well plates in an automatic ABI 3730.

The software phred was used for base calling, and Crossmatch for vector masking [79]. Reading assembly was performed with the CAP3 program [30], using read quality

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/31

and defaults parameters. Similarity searches were performed with the standalone version of BLAST [31], against
the NCBI non redundant protein, nucleotide and EST
databases [32], the Arabidopsis thaliana protein set from
TAIR database [33] and the Oryza sativa protein set from
TIGR Rice database [80]. Parsing of the BLAST results was
performed with the Bio::SearchIO module [81] from the
Bioperl package [82].
Protein translation was performed with prot4EST
polypeptide prediction pipeline [36], which combines
different methods like ESTscan [83], DECODER [84] and
similarity search results (BLASTX) to produce accurate
translations. Motif search was performed with the standalone version of the interProScan tool that combines the
protein function recognition methods of the database
members of InterPro into one single application [37]. The
InterPro database unites the following secondary databases: Uniprot [85], Panther [86], PROSITE [87], PRINTS
[88], Pfam [89], ProDom [90], SMART [91], TIGRFAMs
[92], PIR [93] and SUPERFAMILY [94].
Gene Ontology annotation of unigenes was performed
with BLAST2GO [38]. Blast2GO is a user adjustable tool
that utilizes BLAST to find homologous sequences for a set
of query sequences and returns an evaluated annotation
from the gene ontology annotations present in the BLAST
hits of each sequence. B2G parameters were: NCBI nonredundant DB for BLAST search, 20 hits maximum for
BLAST result, 100 nt as minimum HSP-length to retain
putative annotating hits and default Evidence Code
Weights for Gene Ontology annotation that assigns high
ECWs to experimental-based and curated annotations
while penalized electronic and non-curated annotations.
Minimum values for BLAST e-value and % similarity of
the BLAST result were e-06 and 55% respectively and ultimate annotation cut-off value was set to 55. This set of
parameters was shown to provide the most reliable results
in the annotation of Arabidopsis sequences [38]. GOSlim
annotations of the Citrus unigenes were also generated
with the B2G software using the plant GOSlim mapping
provided in TAIR.
5. Gene space analysis
Single copy gene set from A. thaliana was obtained from
the Compositae Genome Project Database [58] and used
as query in a BLAST search against a database generated
with the Citrus unigenes. These results were compared
with those obtained with the BLASTX search performed
with the Citrus unigenes against the Arabidopsis complete
protein set. Only Unigenes with a unique Arabidopsis significant hit that matched the results obtained with the first
BLAST search were considered to be putative orthologs of
the Arabidopsis single copy genes. A similar approach was
used to detect possible gene duplications, selecting those

Page 18 of 22

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:31

Citrus unigenes that had as significant hits the same A.
thaliana protein. ESTs corresponding to the selected unigenes were reassembled with the Staden package [46] to
confirm that the Unigenes were overlapping rather than
identical sequences.
The A. thaliana gene family dataset was obtained from
TAIR [33] and the Arabidopsis best hit of the Citrus unigenes was used to find Citrus representatives of relevant
families. ESTs from the overrepresented Citrus families
were selected and reassembled with the Staden package
[46], and only overlapping non-identical consensus
sequences were considered for further analysis. For the
phylogenetic study of the ammonium transporter and glycosyltransferase 20 families, a multiple proteins sequence
alignment was carried out with ClustalX [95], genetic distances were calculated with the protein correction for the
poisson method [96], and phylogenetic trees were constructed with the neighbor joining tree method [97], using
the Molecular Evolutionary Genetic Analysis software
package MEGA3 [98].
