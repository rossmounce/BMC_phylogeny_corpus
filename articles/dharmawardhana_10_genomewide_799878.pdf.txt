Genome-wide transcriptome analysis of the
transition from primary to secondary stem
development in Populus trichocarpa
Palitha Dharmawardhana1, Amy M Brunner2, Steven H Strauss1*

Abstract
Background: With its genome sequence and other experimental attributes, Populus trichocarpa has become the
model species for genomic studies of wood development. Wood is derived from secondary growth of tree stems,
and begins with the development of a ring of vascular cambium in the young developing stem. The terminal
region of the developing shoot provides a steep developmental gradient from primary to secondary growth that
facilitates identification of genes that play specialized functions during each of these phases of growth.
Results: Using a genomic microarray representing the majority of the transcriptome, we profiled gene expression
in stem segments that spanned primary to secondary growth. We found 3,016 genes that were differentially
expressed during stem development (Q-value ≤ 0.05; >2-fold expression variation), and 15% of these genes encode
proteins with no significant identities to known genes. We identified all gene family members putatively involved
in secondary growth for carbohydrate active enzymes, tubulins, actins, actin depolymerizing factors, fasciclin-like
AGPs, and vascular development-associated transcription factors. Almost 70% of expressed transcription factors
were upregulated during the transition to secondary growth. The primary shoot elongation region of the stem
contained specific carbohydrate active enzyme and expansin family members that are likely to function in primary
cell wall synthesis and modification. Genes involved in plant defense and protective functions were also dominant
in the primary growth region.
Conclusion: Our results describe the global patterns of gene expression that occur during the transition from
primary to secondary stem growth. We were able to identify three major patterns of gene expression and overrepresented gene ontology categories during stem development. The new regulatory factors and cell wall
biogenesis genes that we identified provide candidate genes for further functional characterization, as well as new
tools for molecular breeding and biotechnology aimed at improvement of tree growth rate, crown form, and
wood quality.

Background
With the completion of its genome sequence Populus
trichocarpa, the genus Populus (poplar) has become the
consensus model taxon for woody plant genomics and
biotechnology. Many attributes of Populus makes it well
suited for genomic research, including facile transformation of selected genotypes; abundant natural genetic
diversity; ease of vegetative propagation; rapid growth;
interspecific hybrids and mapping pedigrees; availability
of genome scale microarrays; and abundant EST

resources (reviewed in [1-3]). Although herbaceous
short generation models such as Arabidopsis have
powerful advantages for studying plant development,
including fundamental aspects of lignocellulosic tissue
development [4-6], poplar enables a detailed, integrated
analysis of secondary growth and other developmental
processes such as seasonal dormancy induction whose
expression is not fully developed in annual herbaceous
species.
The perennial stem growth habit of most tree species
is characterized by secondary growth that results in a
cumulative increase in girth during each growth cycle.
This is achieved by cell division activity of the vascular

cambium, with subsequent differentiation of secondary
xylem towards the inside of the cambium and secondary
phloem towards the outside. This coordinated and
environmentally responsive program of meristematic differentiation and tissue patterning involves multiple
developmental processes with interacting regulatory
mechanisms (reviewed in [7,8,4]).
With the increasing availability of genomic tools,
many studies have been conducted to help understand
these developmental processes in more depth. Wood
development has been characterized by expression profiling in aspen [9-11], Pinus [12,13], black locust [14],
Eucalyptus [15,16] and spruce [17]. These studies, and
investigations on vascular cell development in herbaceous species Arabidopsis and Zinnia, have identified
several classes of important transcription regulators and
structural genes involved in secondary cell wall biogenesis (reviewed in [8,18,7,19]). The developmental transition from primary to secondary growth that occurs
along the stem has been used as a unique system to
identify processes specific to secondary growth in sitka
spruce [18] and aspen [20,21]. The aspen studies, based
on cDNA-AFLP, characterized 85 and 271 transcript
derived fragments, respectively, as differentially
expressed during secondary growth, and includes many
regulatory and structural genes involved in secondary
growth and secondary wall biogenesis. Our study
extends this line of work to comprehensively cover the
transcriptome of Populus during primary to secondary
growth transition. We detected more than 36,000 Populus trichocarpa genes, and found that more than 3,000
were differentially expressed during stem development.
We also provide an in depth look at the expression of
several classes of transcription regulators and structural
gene families whose functions are closely linked to stem
and wood development.

Results and discussion
Poplar stem development

To determine transcriptional changes that occur during
primary and secondary growth phases of stem development, we analyzed stem segments from successive internodes below the apex (plastochron indices 2, 3, 4, and
5: [22]), and from internode (IN) 9 from further down
the stem. IN1 was not analyzed as it was too short to
sample without including tissue from the nodes and
axillary meristems.
The shoot apical meristem of poplar is an indeterminate primary meristem that gives rise to ground tissue
and procambium. The vascular tissue of primary growth,
primary xylem and primary phloem, develops directly
from procambium and is the dominant vasculature in
IN2 and IN3 (Figure 1). IN3 shows the first signs of
interfascicular parenchyma cells that differentiate into a

full ring of cambium initials, enabling radial secondary
stem growth. IN5 and IN 9 have well developed secondary phloem tissue and secondary xylem vessels, as well
as fibers with well lignified secondary walls (red staining,
Figure 1). Figure 2 illustrates that the zone of stem elongation is limited to the terminal internodes up to IN4,
which essentially corresponds to the primary stem
growth region. With the development of vascular cambium and secondary growth, stem elongation ceases
while the girth of the stem axis continues to increase.
The other secondary meristem, bark/cork cambium,
appears much later during stem development and is not
detectably represented in the IN9 sample. Secondary
growth in this tissue is associated with production of
secondary xylem elements and secondary phloem fibers
that have well developed secondary walls. However,
although a minor component the primary xylem elements in the primary growth region also have some secondary wall formation and associated lignification
(Figure 1, IN3).
Secondary Xylem Marker Genes are upregulated in IN9

We assessed our data for quantitative correspondence to
published literature. Ko et al [23] have identified a core
set of 52 Arabidopsis xylem-predominant genes through
a global comparative transcriptome analysis of Arabidopsis “secondary growth” tissue, digital northern data
from 45 organ/tissue types, and digital in situ data from
vascular versus epidermal tissue. From these 52 “core”
Arabidopsis genes we identified 69 homologous P. trichocarpa gene models on our array, and all but 8 genes
in the core set had clear P. trichocarpa homologs (Additional file 1). More than 80% (51 genes) of expressed
genes in this group (63) showed more than a 2-fold
increase in the internode 9 sample (secondary growth
dominant) when compared to the internode 3 sample
(primary growth dominant: Figure 3A). A similar comparison of transcription factors associated with Populus
and Arabidopsis secondary tissue [24] showed that only
2 genes out of the 82 expressed showed 2-fold or more
down-regulation in internode 9 compared to internode
3 (Figure 3B); in contrast 41 genes (50%) showed more
than a 2-fold increase. These results also support the
biological accuracy and precision of data generated from
our array.
Global expression profile during stem development

Total RNA derived from the 5 stem internode development series described above was used for expression
profiling with a Nimblegen microarray representing the
whole annotated transcriptome at the time that the
array was created. Within the 5 stem internode samples
we could detect the expression of 43,283 genes out of
the 65,915 represented on the array (9,995 unigenes

derived from aspen EST sequences: [25]). To identify
statistically significant, differentially expressed genes
within the developmental series we used the EDGE software package [26,27]. A total of 4,279 Populus trichocarpa genes were identified as differentially expressed
within the stem developmental series, when a Q value
cutoff of 0.05 was employed; 87 genes were differentially
expressed at a Q value cutoff of 0.01 (Additional file 2).
To achieve a more stringent gene list we further filtered
the 4,279 genes to remove weakly expressed genes
(below 1.5 X the mean intensity of controls plus one
standard error), and also removed genes with a foldchange below two. The resulting 3,016 genes were considered as differentially expressed in the manuscript,
and used for further analysis and clustering. More than
15% of these genes were novel and had no significant

BLAST returns (’No hit’ cutoff e-10) in TAIR Arabidopsis or NCBI non-redundant sequence databases (June
2008). As the tissue sampling for this experiment was
carried out at one time point during the active growth
period, the set of differentially expressed genes might
not reflect additional genes that have highly specific patterns of diurnal or seasonal regulation. To validate our
differentially expressed gene list, we conducted qRTPCR on three additional biological replicates using a
subset of genes that were at the FDR cutoff of 0.05.
Except for one out of the 9 genes tested, all showed a
positive correlation between microarray and qRT-PCR
expression patterns. The microarray and qRT-PCR
derived fold-changes between elongation zone (IN2) and
secondary growth dominant (IN9 or IN5) zones are illustrated in Additional File 3. The weakly regulated gene

number one, identified as differentially expressed in the
microarray dataset, did not show differential expression
between IN2 and IN9 in the qRT-PCR analysis. As is
commonly reported for microarray and qRT-PCR comparisons, the qRT-PCR expression fold-differences for
all of the genes, except number 6 and 1, were considerably higher than that estimated from microarray data.
The clustering of all regulated genes (3016 genes)
showed (Figure 4A) three main patterns of gene expression (gene order in additional file 2 correspond to the
cluster diagram in Figure 4A). The collection of genes
in cluster number 1 mostly showed increasing expression going from IN5 to IN9, with strongest expression
in IN9. Cluster number 2 gene expression was dominant
in the stem elongation and primary growth region (IN2,
IN3), and tapered off as secondary growth began. Cluster number 3 genes showed strong upregulation in both
IN5 and IN9, with its peak expression for most genes in
IN5. This group also included some genes that showed

more complex expression patterns, with upregulation in
younger internodes (IN2, IN3) in addition to IN9.
Based on gene expression, the IN5 sample largely clustered with IN9 (Figure 4A), rather than with the IN4
sample that is adjacent in the stem. This correlated well
with the switch to stem radial growth following activation of secondary growth in IN5. Thus, most genes are
likely to be involved in processes specific to vascular
cambium activity and secondary growth. Highly
expressed genes in these 2 clusters include lignin

genes are listed in Additional file 2. (B) 439 transcription factor

biosynthetic genes, cell wall carbohydrate metabolic
genes, arabinogalactan proteins, cytoskeleton-associated
genes, and a number of transcription factor genes (discussed below). Other very active genes during secondary
growth included transporter genes (peptide and amino
acid transporters, aquaporins), proteases, lipid transfer
protein and metallothionin-like genes.
The upper quarter of cluster 3 shows a sub-cluster of
genes that are upregulated mainly in IN5. The latter
group of genes could be associated predominantly with
early stages of secondary growth activity of the cambium. As evident in IN5 stem cross section (Figure 1),
the secondary wall development and lignification of
xylem is just beginning in this sample, whereas well
developed and lignified walls appear mainly in IN9
xylem. A highly expressed xyloglucan endotrans glycosylase belonging to this group has been reported to be
highly expressed in aspen tension wood and is suggested
to be involved in maintaining crosslinks between G and
S layers of highly cellulosic tension wood fibers [28].
Several pectin methyl esterases and a UDP-glucose
dehydrogenase that are likely involved in pectin and
hemicellulose formation are also present within this
group.
miRNAs have recently been recognized as critical
post-transcriptional regulators of plant development and
stress response. Our array contains only 47 miRNA precursors based on knowledge at the time of its creation;
however, 234 miRNAs are now reported for poplar
(miRBase miRNA database 2008 [29]). We were able to
detect expression for 21 of these but only a few showed
distinct regulation. miRNA164, 162a and 168 showed
secondary development zone dominant expression.
miRNA168 shows the strongest upregulation and is
known to control Argonaute expression in Arabidopsis
and poplar [30-32], which in turn is required for stem
cell functioning, organ polarity, and root initiation in
Arabidopsis [30,33].
Highly expressed genes within cluster number 2
include genes associated with primary cell wall synthesis,
cell wall loosening/extension, and plant defense. Putative
cell elongation-related genes within this group include
expansins, extensins, a cell elongation protein similar to
DWARF1, and an apyrase. DWARF1 [34] is a Ca/Calmodulin-regulated brassinosteroid biosynthetic gene
required for cell elongation in Arabidopsis [35].
Apyrases are documented to be involved in cell growth
regulation and accumulate in rapidly growing tissues
with high auxin concentrations [36]. Thaumatin and
osmotin-like proteins can have b-glucanase functions
[37], and are also represented in the elongation zone
dominant group. Biosynthetic genes that take part in
plant secondary metabolite production are also well
represented in this group and include several polyphenol

oxidases, chlalcone synthases, and flavonol 3-hydroxylases. Phenolic and other defense-related genes have also
been reported to be upregulated in young Sitka spruce
stems [38]. In addition to the IN9-upregulated lipid
transfer protein, several others are upregulated in the
elongation zone. Lipid transfer proteins are abundant
lipid binding-capable proteins with diverse proposed
(but mostly unconfirmed) functions [39]. These include
plant defense, signaling, cuticle biosynthesis, and cell
wall loosening [40,41]. Most of the lipid transfer proteins upregulated in developing Sitka spruce stem were
also found in the primary growth region [38].
Gene function during early xylem maturation

To help assess the biological function of the regulated
genes we identified during the early stages of cambial
zone differentiation into xylem, we compared our results
to previous studies of gene expression in aspen [42,43,9].
These studies used high resolution tangential cambial
zone cryosectioning, but employed cDNA based microarrays that represented only ~30% of predicted gene
models in poplar. Nonetheless, as discussed below,
many genes were in common with the genes we
identified.
We compared the genes showing the highest expression ratio in xylem maturation zone cryosections [42] to
the differentially expressed gene set in our study. Of the
330 genes with the highest expression ratio (log2 ratio
>2) in the initial maturation zone (MX1- [42]), we
found 137 counterparts in our differentially expressed
gene set (Figure 4A). Out of the 137 overlapping genes,
131 grouped in the IN5 and IN9 upregulated gene clusters (Figure 4A: Cluster 1 and 3), supporting their involvement in xylem maturation. The genes’ closest hits and
Arabidopsis homologs are listed in Additional file 4 and
shows a dominant presence of genes associated with lignin biosynthesis, cell wall carbohydrate biosynthesis, and
cell wall-associated proteins. Other major genes in common included transcription regulators (bZIP, MYB, ZFC3HC4, LIM), hormone response genes (IAA, ethylene),
and signaling genes (kinases, calmodulin binding), and
cytoskeleton-associated genes (tubulins, microtubuleassociated proteins).
Functional roles of differentially expressed genes during
stem development

To get a broader perspective on the function of differentially expressed genes, we analyzed for over-representation of gene ontology (GO) categories in each of the
three main gene expression pattern clusters identified in
figure 4A. The cluster 1 genes showed progressive upregulation with secondary growth (highest expression in
IN9). Biological processes enriched in this group (Figure
5A) included several stress and stimulus response genes,

(C) Cluster 3 genes. The circles are shaded based on significance
level (yellow = FDR below 0.05), and the radius of each circle

secondary metabolic process genes dominated by lignin/
phenylpropanoid biosynthetic genes, and cell death-associated genes. This enrichment should correlate with secondary wall development and terminal stages of xylem
development that result in programmed cell death. The
molecular function category is also highly enriched in
transcription factor and DNA binding activity genes, as
well as in protein binding activity genes related to
cytoskeleton.
Cluster 3 genes also showed upregulation in both IN5
and IN9, but as opposed to cluster 1 peak expression
was mainly in IN5. This contrast was visible in gene
enrichment categories with primary cell wall and early
stage secondary cell wall development-related categories
showing dominance. The carbohydrate metabolic process and catalytic activity groups include cellulose biosynthesis, hemicelluloses/xylan biosynthetic genes as
well as glycosyl group transferase activity and ubiquitin
ligase activity-associated genes.
Cluster 2 genes, mainly upregulated in primary growth
dominant IN2 and IN3 showed enrichment for many
categories of biological processes, molecular functions
and cellular components. Dominant biological process
functional categories include active cell growth, development/morphogenesis/differentiation, and metabolic process-associated genes that reflect activities related to
primary growth. Enrichment of nucleotide metabolism
and DNA replication related categories could also reflect
the high cell division activity during the initiation of
cambium in the IN3 region. The secondary metabolismenriched group includes flavonoid and anthocyanin biosynthetic genes.
Transcription factor and regulatory genes

There are 2,576 transcription factors and regulatory
genes in two poplar databases (http://dptf.cbi.pku.edu.
cn/ and http://plntfdb.bio.uni-potsdam.de/v2.0/), and
2,542 of these were represented on the array. We found
that 1801 genes were expressed at detectable levels in at
least one of the 5 internode samples. Figure 4B shows
the clustering of 439 transcription factors that are differentially regulated during stem development (see additional file 5 for gene identities). A recent related study
on transcriptome changes during shoot organogenesis in
Populus identified a comparable number (588) of regulated transcription factors [44]. We could recognize
clusters upregulated in IN5-IN9, and in IN2-IN3. The
majority of regulated transcription factors (69%) that
were upregulated correlated with the onset of secondary
growth.
Transcription factors that are predominantly expressed
during vascular development and secondary growth are
of considerable interest due to the economic importance
of wood and wood fibers. As regulators that help to

Page 7 of 19

control response networks, they may be important tools
for modifying wood or fiber qualities. Schrader et al. [9]
have reported high resolution transcription maps of
aspen wood forming tissue and have identified potential
regulators of xylem differentiation. Many transcription
factor and gene regulator classes have been reported in
the literature to play a role in vascular and xylem development in different plant species (additional file 6). We
selected all expressed genes belonging to these gene
families in poplar and displayed their expression as a
cluster diagrams (additional file 7). The sub-clusters of
genes expressed in association with secondary growth of
each gene family are illustrated separately in Figure 6.
With 297 identified members, MYB and MYB-like
genes are the largest transcription factor family in poplar.
Out of the 187 genes expressed in developing stems,
more than 50% show secondary growth-associated
expression patterns. MYBs are implicated as critical regulators of vascular differentiation and phenylpropanoid
metabolism in plants, including the tree genera Picea,
Pinus, Eucalyptus and Populus [45-48]. Overexpression
of Pinus MYBs have resulted in ectopic lignification in
tobacco [49]. The secondary wall biosynthesis-regulating
Arabidopsis MYB46 has also been demonstrated to be a
direct target of the secondary wall-associated NAC
domain transcription factor SND1 [50], further elaborating the network of interactions. The Populus trichocarpa
homologue of Arabidopsis MYB46, gw1.IX.3536.1 is also
uprgulated in IN5, IN9 samples (Figure 6, Additional file
7). The complete group of secondary growth-associated
MYB family members is identified in Figure 6.
Similar to MYBs, nearly 50% of expressed NACs, one
of the largest plant-specific transcription factor families,
were upregulated during secondary growth (Figure 6).
Arabidopsis NACs, VND(Vascular-related NACdomain), and NST(NAC secondary wall thickening promoting factor) groups of genes have preferred expression in vascular tissue, and have been identified as
regulators of xylem vessel element differentiation and
secondary wall formation in ‘secondary growth’ tissue of
Arabidopsis [51,50,52]. The ectopic expression of VND6,
VND7, NST1, NST2 and NST3/SND1 have induced
transdifferentiation of various cells to produce thick secondary walls [51,53,51]. The 7 VNDs and 3 NSTs fall
into separate phylogenetic branches but are grouped in
the same subfamily of NAC proteins [51]. Although all
putative Populus homologues of VND and NST are not
regulated in our dataset, VND1 and VND2 homologues
gw1.VII.3881.1 and gw1.57.51.1-JGI and NST3/SND1
homologue gw1.I.5485.1 are upregulated in IN5 and IN9
samples (Figure 6, Additional file 7). These genes were
also specifically upregulated in xylem tissue in a Populus
tissue-type dataset (results not shown), further supporting their role in vascular differentiation. Figure 6

members that show strong secondary growth-associated
upregulation.
The homeodomain-containing superfamily of transcription factors participate in a wide variety of plant
developmental processes. The leucine zipper-associated
HD-Zip, wushel-related WOX, knotted-related KNOX,

and zinc finger-associated ZF-HD homeodomain containing transcription factors have been associated with
processes related to meristem function, organ polarity,
and vascular development in several species [54]. Ko
et al. [23] have shown that a hybrid aspen class III HDZip protein, Pt-HB1 was closely associated with wood
formation and that it was tightly regulated over

Dharmawardhana et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:150
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/150

developmental and seasonal gradients, with highest
expression during the active growing season. A Populus
trichocara homologue of aspen Pt-HB1, estExt_Genewise1_v1.C_660759, was within the IN5, IN9 upregulated
cluster (Figure 6, Additional file 7), and we also found
additional homeodomain superfamily members (HB and
ZF-HD in Figure 6) that were strongly upregulated during secondary growth.
bZIP transcription factors play critical roles in regulating plant defense responses and development [55]. In
addition to being upregulated during Eucalyptus xylem
development [56], the bZIP family has been identified as
one of the transcription factor families most regulated
during Arabidopsis stem development [57], with two
specific candidates associated with xylem fiber differentiation. Poplar homologs of these two bZIP transcription
factors are also represented within the many secondary
growth-associated clusters of bZIP genes in Figure 6.
Although WRKY transcription factors are mainly
implicated in regulating defense signaling [58], they have
also been identified to be upregulated in Arabidopsis
stem secondary growth and xylem tissue [59,60] and in
aspen tension wood [61]. The WRKY family is highly
diversified in plants. There were 21 poplar WRKY members that were upregulated during secondary growth, of a
total of 104 total members in poplar. The functional
study of this subset would help to expand knowledge of
the diversity of WRKY developmental functions in plants.
There were 11 LIM genes associated with secondary
development (Figure 6). LIM domain proteins in eukaryotes act as regulators of transcription, or in organization of the cytoskeleton. Tobacco NtWLIM1 binds Factin and has been suggested to be involved in actin
cytoskeleton stabilization [62]. In sunflower HaPLIM1 is
found in actin-enriched cells, and exhibits non-specific
DNA and RNA binding activity [63]. Tobacco NtLIM1
has been demonstrated to act as a transcription factor
and is able to bind the conserved PAL-box found in
promoters of many phenylpropanoid pathway genes
[64]. Down regulation of NtLIM1 in tobacco also results
in reduced lignin and decreased expression of phenylpropanoid genes. In poplar some LIM genes have been
reported to be upregulated in tension wood [61]. Both
the cytoskeletal component binding and transcription
regulating activity of these genes can influence the lignin
biosynthetic pathway, and thus influence secondary cell
wall properties that affect wood quality and warrants
further study into the secondary development associated
LIM genes illustrated in Figure 6.
The few MADS box gene family members that were
upregulated during secondary growth are illustrated in
Figure 6. MADS box genes are well known for their
involvement in reproductive development in many
plants, and have also been shown to be important in

Page 9 of 19

vegetative development and dormancy in poplar [65,66].
The seasonal expression pattern of aspen MADS-box5
(PTM5) that is also represented in the secondary
growth-associated cluster of poplar genes (Figure 6) is
specific to developing vascular tissue, including vascular
cambium. It interacts with other MADS box proteins
and an actin depolymerizing factor, to perhaps play a
major in control of woody tissue development [66].
An ethylene response element binding factor-like gene
that belongs to AP2/ERF domain transcription factor
class is one of the most strongly regulated genes in secondary growth dominant cluster 1 (Figure 4B). It has
also been identified in aspen [20] as differentially
expressed and phloem localized in secondary tissue.
AP2/ERF family members are known to be involved in
integration of jasmonic acid and ethylene signals in
plant defense [67], but also have members (BOLITA,
BABYBOOM) that affect cell expansion, proliferation
and differentiation pathways in Arabidopsis [68-71].
Carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes)

CAZymes http://www.cazy.org include the large families
of glycosyl transferases (GTs) and glycosyl hydrolases
(GHs), as well as two small families of polysaccharide
lyases (PLs) and carbohydrate esterases (CEs). The full
compliment of Populus CAZymes (1567) have been
identified and reviewed in [72] and expression was analyzed for some families in [73]. Plants have more
CAZymes than other organisms, and they are involved
in diverse functions. These include assimilation of
photosynthetic products, synthesis of various cell wall
polymers, and synthesis and conversion of glycosylated
compounds. Approximately 40% of the CAZymes identified in the Populus trichocarpa genome are represented
in Populus EST collections [73]. Our data indicated that
71% of all CAZymes identified on the array are
expressed during stem development (993 out of 1,392;
Table 1). The expression of both GTs and GHs show
relatively small clusters of genes that are associated with
secondary growth (Additional file 8), and these could be

gene family members associated with secondary wall
metabolism. In contrast, a large proportion of GHs
show elongation zone dominant expression patterns.
Some members of this group could be involved in primary cell wall metabolism, cell wall loosening, and cell
elongation. The poplar homologues of Arabidopsis
FRA8, IRX8 and IRX9, and glucuronoxylan biosynthesissecondary wall localized GT family genes [74,75] have
also been localized to aspen secondary wall containing
cells [76]. These three genes are grouped with the secondary growth-associated cluster of genes during stem
development (Additional file 8).
Pectins include chemically diverse polymers that are
major components of cell walls. They are important for
wall plasticity and cell adhesion, and are major constituent of primary walls of poplar [77] that undergo substantial remodeling during development [78]. In
addition to some GHs, members of CE and PE gene
families are involved in pectin de-esterification/acetylation and pectin degradation. Siedlecka et al. [79] have
shown that aspen pectin methyl transferases are
involved in intrusive and symplastic cell growth in

Page 10 of 19

developing wood cells. The small clusters of PL and CE
gene family members that are preferentially expressed in
the elongation zone (Additional file 8) are possible candidates for control of pectin restructuring during stem
elongation. The secondary growth-associated small clusters of PL and CE gene families are likely to be involved
in pectin remodeling during the early stages of secondary wall biosynthesis and radial and intrusive growth of
cambial derivatives. This would be applicable to the CE
family members that show highest expression in IN5.
We have illustrated the expression pattern of all
expressed cellulose synthase (CesA) and hemicelluloserelated cellulose synthase-like (Csl) genes in Figure 7.
These were separated from other GT family members
due to their importance in cellulose and hemicellulose
biosynthesis. Populus CesA and Csl genes have been
investigated earlier for family structure and expression
in different tissue types [80-82], which led to the identification of a few members that are highly expressed in
xylem tissue. Our results show a cluster of four genes
that are highly expressed in the secondary growth zone
that are homologous to Arabidopsis IRX1 (CesA8),

IRX3 (CesA7) and IRX5 (CesA4) that are known essential components of cellulose synthesizing complex in
Arabidopsis (Figure 7, Additional file 9). In addition, we
could recognize a cluster predominantly expressed in
the elongation zone and a cluster with dominant expression in IN5 in addition to elongation zone. These gene
family members could preferentially be involved in primary cell wall synthesis during primary growth and secondary growth, respectively.
Expansins and extensins

Expansins are considered one of the primary regulators
of plant cell expansion and loosening [83,84].

Page 11 of 19

a-expansins are abundant in aspen secondary xylem
[85], and ectopic expression promotes cell expansion in
both primary and secondary tissue of aspen [86]. Clustering showed a distinct group of five genes with secondary growth dominant expression, and a few other
clusters with elongation zone only, or elongation zone
and IN5 dominant expression (Figure 8A).
Extensins are cell wall structural proteins that take part
in plant pathogen response and plant cell wall assembly,
acting as scaffolds [87]. During poplar stem development
a large proportion of extensin family members are preferentially expressed in the elongation zone, with IN3 sample showing the highest expression (Figure 8B).

Dharmawardhana et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:150
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/150

Cytoskeletal components

The cytoskeleton plays an essential role in guiding and
trafficking cellulose synthase complexes during cellulose
deposition in secondary cell walls [88]. In developing
xylem cells, microtubule bundles maintain the cellulose
synthase complexes beneath the sites of secondary wall
synthesis, while actin is required for delivery and rapid
trafficking of complex-containing organelles around the

Page 12 of 19

cell [88]. Xylem fiber localized tubulin gene family
members in Eucalyptus and Populus have also been
reported to play a role in determining the cellulose
microfibril orientation and angle, a determinant of wood
fiber and timber quality [89,90]. Figure 9 illustrates the
distinct groups of gene family members associated with
secondary growth for actin, tubulin, and actin depolymerizing factor gene families. a- and b-tubulin genes

that were upregulated in xylem and during tension
wood formation [90] are within the secondary growth
dominant group of genes in Figure 9. The similar upregulation of cell wall-associated cellulose synthase genes,
and a Korrigan endoglucanase, in induced aspen tension
wood [91] has led to suggest coordinated regulation of
tubulin genes with cellulose biosynthesis machinery
[90]. A smaller number of tubulin genes also showed
preferential expression in the elongation zone.
Fasciclin like-AGP

Arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs) belong to the large
family of hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs) and
also include extensins (discussed earlier), proline/hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins, and lectins [92]. Fasciclinlike arabinogalactan proteins are a subclass of AGPs containing domains that resemble Drosophila fasciclin cell
adhesion molecules [92]. Several Fasciclin like-AGPs
have been associated with wood formation and are preferentially expressed in differentiating xylem in several
species, including Populus [93,94,61,95]. Figure 10A illustrates that all gene family members except three are preferentially expressed in the wood forming IN9 sample.
The lack of strong upregulation of this group of genes in
the IN5 sample, and the exclusive expression of this
group in xylem from a tissue type gene expression dataset (Figure 10B), illustrates its predominant role in xylem
secondary wall biogenesis. Two genes showed high
expression in the IN4 sample as opposed to IN9.
Phenylpropanoid and lignin-related genes

An expression cluster diagram of phenylpropanoid genes
identified in the poplar genome [2] is given in Figure 11.
As expected, most lignin-related phenylpropanoid genes
are predominantly expressed in the secondary growth
zone. A small group that includes two phenylalanine
amonnia lyases (PAL3 and 4), a coumaroyl 3-hydroxylase CYP98A23 (C3H like), four hydroxycinnamoyl CoA
shikimate/quinate hydroxycinnamoyltransferases (HCT/
HCQ 1, 2,4 and 5), and two 4-coumarate:CoA ligases
(4CL1) are expressed predominantly in the elongation
zone. These enzymes are involved in the early steps of
phenylpropanoid metabolism and are likely involved in
the biosynthesis of non-lignin components of phenylpropanoid derivatives such as phenolic esters and glycosides, condensed tannins, and flavonoid precursors.
These are well known to have a variety of tissue abundances and complex responses to environment [96-98]
that are mostly related to pathogen defense and protective functions.

Conclusion
We have documented the transcriptome changes that
occur during the transition from primary to secondary

Page 13 of 19

growth using sequential stem developmental stages.
More than 3,000 genes were identified as differentially
expressed, which is likely to be a conservative estimate
due to the use of two biological replicates. Our results
provide an extensive catalog of regulatory factors and
cell wall biogenesis genes involved in stem elongation
and secondary growth phase of tree development, whose
potential applications include candidate genes for study
of natural polymorphisms, targets for reverse genetic
studies of tree development, and tools for marker-aided
breeding or genetic engineering of tree growth and
wood quality. The transcriptome patterns provided will
also aid in making functional interpretations for the vast
number of genes that have poorly known biochemical
and developmental functions.

Methods
Plant material

Two healthy, rapidly growing, three-year-old Populus
trichocarpa trees (clone Nisqually-1) at a field site in
Corvallis, Oregon (USA) were selected for the study.
The sample collection was performed on a clear day
between 10 am and 11 am in August 2005. RNA from
each of the two trees was used for separate array hybridizations, serving as separate biological replicates. Technical replications of hybridizations were not performed
due to high platform technical consistency as determined in a previous study. Following measurement of
internode lengths, the internodes (excluding the nodes)
from the apical bud to the base of the shoot were
excised into liquid nitrogen in the field and stored at
-80°C. A 2 mm long segment of each internode was
fixed in FAA for microscopy. Following dehydration
these tissue segments were embedded in wax for sectioning (WAX-IT Histology Services, Vancouver). Dewaxed stem sections were stained with Toluidine BlueO [99] and photographed.
RNA isolation

RNA was isolated using Qiagen RNeasy kit using the
manufacturers protocols, incorporating the Qiagen “on
column” DNAse I treatment to remove contaminating
genomic DNA. The quality of total RNA was assessed
by absorption at 260 nm/280 nm, gel electrophoresis,
and via the Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies,
USA).
Microarray analysis

A poplar Nimblegen microarray http://www.nimblegen.
com/ targeting 55,794 predicted genes from the Populus
trichocarpa genome sequencing project, 126 mitochondrial and chloroplast gene models and 9995 unigenes
derived from aspen EST sequences [25] were utilized for
the experiment. Each gene model is represented by 3

replicated 60mer isothermal probes on the array. A total
of 20 ug of quality tested total RNA from each sample
was used for labeling. Array hybridization, quality control and data extraction were carried out by Nimblegen
using their established microarray processing pipeline
[100]. The complete microarray dataset has been deposited at NCBI GEO database http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/
with Accession # GES13043

Microarray data were normalized across all the arrays
used in the experiment using the Bioconductor - Robust
Multiarray Averaging (RMA) protocol incorporated in
the NimbleScan (Nimblegen Inc.) software. Duplicate
readings were averaged following normalization. Background hybridization intensity for determining expressed
genes was estimated using signal intensity of negative
control probes on the array (Escherichia coli DNA

The mean of normalized fluorescence intensity value
plus one standard error of the negative controls of all
arrays in the experiment was defined as the expression
threshold. Gene Spring 7.3 (Agilent Technologies, USA),
EDGE [26] and Microarray Software Suite-MeV4.0
http://www.tm4.org/ software were utilized for further
data analysis and graphical display of results. Normalized data were analyzed using EDGE [26] to generate a
list of differentially expressed genes with a false discovery rate cut off of 0.05. EDGE is a cross-platform, compatible open-source software running on the R statistical
software package, and is based on a novel statistical
methods that includes an Optimal Discovery Procedure
and a time course methodology [101,26]. Clustering of
gene expression was performed using hierarchical algorithm based on Pearson correlations and within-gene
averaging. Populus trichocarpa genes homologous to
Arabidopsis were identified using JGI annotation or

edu. Functional enrichment/over-representation analysis
was carried out using the network visualization program
Cytoscape with GO plugins. For over representation
determination, the Benjamini and Hochberg FDRadjusted significance level cutoff was set at 0.05.
Array quality and data precision

The A260/A280 ratios of RNA samples used for hybridizations ranged from 1.7 to 2.0. The absence of contaminating genomic DNA and integrity of RNA samples
were examined by Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. RNA Integrity Numbers (RIN) of samples used for hybridization
ranged from 8.1 to 10.0. The correlation coefficients (r2)
of pair wise comparisons of normalized intensity values
between the biological replicates ranged from 0.90 to
0.97. Data precision was estimated by calculating the
mean coefficient of variation for the two biological replicates for the first internode sample (IN2) for all
expressed genes (36,284). The mean standard deviation

Dharmawardhana et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:150
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/150

was 0.71 (14.8%), and the mean standard error was 0.50
(10.5%). To evaluate the correspondence between the
biological replicates, in additional file 10 we present
scatter plots of intensity values for all differentially
expressed genes (FDR 0.05, 2 fold) between sample 1
(tree 1) and sample 2 (tree 2) at each internode. The
graph shows that 99% of the genes fall within the 2-fold
demarcation lines. The biological accuracy and precision
of data generated from our arrays are further supported
by the quantitative correspondence of secondary xylem
marker gene expression from previously published literature described above (Figure 3).
Quantitative RT-PCR

Real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRTPCR) was employed to validate a select set of differentially expressed genes observed in our microarray study.
Internode plant material was collected as described earlier from three individual trees different from what had
been used for the microarray study. The sampling date
was two days following the microarray study sampling
date. Nine genes at the FDR cutoff (.049-.05) with low
expression and fold-changes, and falling into the three
main expression patterns (Figure 4A), were selected for
verification. Elongation factor 1-beta (eugene3.00091463)
was selected as the internal control gene [102] based on
its consistency of expression level (mean SD = 11%) in
the 5 stem tissue stages used in the study. RNA extraction, DNAse treatment, and quality control were performed as described above. cDNA synthesis from 1 ug
of total RNA was carried out using a SuperScript III
first-strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen) with oligo dT primers, as in the manufacturer’s instructions. Primers
were designed using Primer3 software (sequences in
Additional file 11). Standard two-step RT-PCR and gel
electrophoresis was used to evaluate primer pair efficacy
and absence of genomic DNA contamination. Triplicate
quantitative PCR assays per sample were performed
using a Platinum SYBR Green Super mix (Invitrogen)
with ROX reference dye according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Dissociation curve analysis was performed at
the end of each reaction to detect primer-dimers and
multiple products. For relative quantification and comparison, we used the delta-delta-Ct method [103] with
elongation factor 1-beta as the normalizing internal control gene. A 100% efficient amplification, resulting in a
doubling of amplification product per cycle, was
assumed (a requirement for the use of delta-delta-Ct
method). This assumption was justified as only primer
pairs showing an efficiency of 100% ± 5%, based on
standard curves (pooled tissue type cDNA) were used
for the experiments.
