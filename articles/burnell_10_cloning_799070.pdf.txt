Cloning and characterization of Escherichia coli
DUF299: a bifunctional ADP-dependent kinase Pi-dependent pyrophosphorylase from bacteria
Jim N Burnell*

Abstract
Background: Phosphoenolpyruvate synthetase (PEPS; EC 2.7.9.2) catalyzes the synthesis of phosphoenolpyruvate
from pyruvate in Escherichia coli when cells are grown on a three carbon source. It also catalyses the anabolic
conversion of pyruvate to phosphoenolpyruvate in gluconeogenesis. A bioinformatics search conducted following
the successful cloning and expression of maize leaf pyruvate, orthophosphate dikinase regulatory protein (PDRP)
revealed the presence of PDRP homologs in more than 300 bacterial species; the PDRP homolog was identified as
DUF299.
Results: This paper describes the cloning and expression of both PEPS and DUF299 from E. coli and establishes
that E. coli DUF299 catalyzes both the ADP-dependent inactivation and the Pi-dependent activation of PEPS.
Conclusion: This paper represents the first report of a bifunctional regulatory enzyme catalysing an ADPdependent phosphorylation and a Pi-dependent pyrophosphorylation reaction in bacteria.

Background
In C4 plants, pyruvate, orthophosphate dikinase (PPDK;
EC 2.7.9.1) catalyses the conversion of pyruvate to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) in what is generally recognized
as the rate-limiting step in C4 photosynthesis [1] according to reaction 1.
Reaction 1.... Pyruvate + ATP + Pi ↔ PEP + AMP +
PPi
In turn, PPDK activity is regulated by light via a rather
unique phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanism.
The regulatory mechanism involved differs from other
phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanisms in a
number of ways. Firstly, the regulatory mechanism uses
ADP rather than ATP as the donor of a phosphate
group. Secondly, the substrate (PPDK) for inactivation is
a catalytically-phosphorylated form of the enzyme substrate. Thirdly, the activation reaction involves a phosphate-dependent phosphorolytic removal of the
regulatory phosphate group rather than a simple phosphatase-catalysed dephosphorylation reaction. And
fourthly, both the inactivation and activation activities

are catalyzed by a single enzyme (see [2] for a review).
The PDRP from maize [3] and Arabidopsis [4] have
recently been cloned and expressed and their homology
to the DUF299 gene family recognised.
A phylogenetic analysis of the DUF299 amino acid
sequences available in GenBank segregated the DUF299
proteins into two major clades representing those bacterial species that possess PPDK and those that possess
phosphoenolpyruvate synthetase (PEPS; EC 2.7.9.2) (see
Results and Discussion below). PEPS is an enzyme
found in many bacteria and catalyzes the phosphorylation of pyruvate to PEP according to reaction 2.
Reaction 2...... Pyr + ATP ↔ PEP + AMP + Pi
Although there are varying degrees of homology
between PPDKs and PEPSs the two types of enzyme can
be discriminated by signature sequences identified by
Tjaden et al [5]. An examination of the location of the
duf299 gene in the genome of a large number of bacteria revealed that the gene is often, but not always,
located close to either the peps or the ppdk gene. It is
also interesting to note that although many members of
the Archaea possess either the ppdk or peps gene they
do not contain the duf299 gene.

PEP synthetase is present in many bacteria and has an
important role in gluconeogenesis when bacteria are
grown on small carbon substrates [6]. E. coli mutant
studies demonstrated that PEPS-deficient mutants were
unable to grow on pyruvate, lactate or alanine [7].
Cooper and Kornberg [8] also suggested that the reaction catalysed by PEPS involved the transfer of a phosphoryl-group from ATP to the enzyme and a
phosphorylated form of the enzyme was isolated [8].
The formation of an EP form of the enzyme either in
the presence of ATP or PEP was subsequently reported
[9] and a histidine residue identified as the site of phosphorylation [10].
The successful expression of the maize PDRP
(DUF299) and the close similarity of the amino acid
sequence of bacterial DUF299 prompted an investigation
of the role of the DUF299 from E. coli. This paper
reports experiments performed with E. coli PEPS and
DUF299 that clearly demonstrate that E. coli PEPS is
controlled by a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation
mechanism similar to that found in plants. And finally,
given its function, it is proposed that this protein be
given the common name of the PEP synthetase regulatory protein and the abbreviation PSRP be used to discriminate it from PDRP, DUF299 proteins that may
catalyse the regulation of PPDK.

Results and discussion
Phylogenetic analysis of DUF299 amino acid sequences

A phylogenetic analysis of DUF299 amino acid
sequences from a range of plant and bacterial species
revealed divergence in amino acid sequences that segregated into two major clades (Figure 1). Further examination of the genomes of the species revealed that the
DUF299-containing species segregated according to
whether they possessed either PPDK (the upper half of
the tree) or PEPS (the lower half of the tree); the identity of PPDK and PEPS was based on previously identified signature sequences [5].
Cloning and expression of PEPS and PSRP

The DNA sequences of the PEPS and PSRP inserts in
pROEXa were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Modifications to standard expression and extraction protocols
were required to maximize the production of soluble,
stable forms of both enzymes. PEPS expression was
optimised by initially growing cells at 37°C for 3 h and
pre-cooling cultures to 25°C prior to isopropyl thiogalactoside (IPTG) induction of protein synthesis. In addition, dithiothreitol (DTT), to a final concentration of 10
mM, and glycerol, to a final concentration of 20% (v/v),
was required to be added to the purified protein to
retain active, soluble protein. The purified protein was
stable for several days at room temperature or for more
than 6 months at -80°C. Cold stored enzyme needed to

Page 2 of 8

be reactivated by incubation at room temperature for at
least 20 min.
For PSRP, cultures had to be cooled to 18°C prior to
induction of protein synthesis at 18°C, and glycerol had
to be included in all solutions used during the purification of the protein, to maintain the enzyme in a soluble
form. The purified protein was stable for at least a week
when stored on ice.
The MW of the PSRP subunits were about 25 kDa as
determined by SDS-PAGE. The native size of the E. coli
PSRP as determined by Sephacryl S200 gel filtration
indicated the native form of the protein is a tetramer
eluting from the column between lactate dehydrogenase
(MW 140 kDa) and malate dehydrogenase (MW 67
kDa). It is not known whether the quaternary structure
of the E. coli PSRP changes with pH; the maize PDRP is
a dimer at pH 7.5 and a tetramer at pH 8.3 [11]. There
was no evidence to suggest that the N-terminal His6-tag
of pROEX, which included the amino acid sequence
MSYYHHHHHHDYDIPTTENLYFQGA, affected PSRP
activity in any way.
Inactivation and activation activities of the expressed E.
coli PSRP

The purified PSRP catalysed both the ADP/ATP-dependent inactivation (Table 1) and the Pi-dependent activation of purified E. coli PEPS (Table 2). In addition, the
expressed PSRP catalysed in-assay activation. In-assay
activation occurs when inactivated PEPS in aliquots
taken from a separate inactivation reaction activates in
the assay used to measure PEPS activity. Addition of Pi
to reaction mixtures used to measure PEPS activity in
aliquots taken from inactivation reactions resulted in an
increasing rate of PEPS activity; in the absence of added
Pi PEPS activity remained linear. Therefore it was significantly easier to measure PEPS inactivation compared to
measuring maize PPDK regulation due to the fact that
there was no in-assay activation if Pi was omitted from
reactions measuring PEPS activity. Therefore, in contrast
to measuring maize PDRP activity, there was no need to
add Blue Dextran or Cibacron blue to inhibit in-assay
activation when inactivation activities of E. coli PEPS
were measured.
Addition of pyruvate to inactivation reactions inhibited ADP/ATP-dependent inactivation of E. coli PEPS
(Figure 2). This result is similar to the pyruvate-dependent inhibition of PDRP-catalysed regulation of maize
leaf PPDK [12] and indicated that
E. coli PEPS had to be catalytically-phosphorylated
prior to being inactivated. This was confirmed by preincubating PEPS with PEP, removing the PEP by Sephadex G25 column chromatography and subjecting the
catalytically-phosphorylated PEPS to ADP-dependent
inactivation in the presence of hexokinase and glucose;
glucose and hexokinase were added to remove any ATP

PEPS inactivation was measured as described in Materials and methods. The experiment was repeated five times and results presented in the table are from one
experiment that was representative of all five experiments.

that may have been formed from ADP in the presence
of contaminating adenylate kinase (Figure 3). Only
about 40% of the PEPS was inactivated which suggested
that less than 50% of the PEPS was catalytically phosphorylated during pre-incubation with PEP. This result
was investigated further and it was shown that a small
amount of Pi and AMP present in the assay (presumably
from the degradation of ADP) was responsible for the
dephosphorylation of the catalytic histidine residue of
PEPS.
Compared to the regulation of maize leaf PPDK by
PDRP, the inactivation of E. coli PEPS by E. coli PSRP
was considerably more sensitive to inhibition by pyruvate (see Figure 3), being almost five times more sensitive than maize PDRP (see [13]).
Inclusion of ADP (1 mM final concentration) in activation assays demonstrated that ADP inhibited P i dependent activation (results not shown). This result is
consistent with the ADP-dependent inhibition of P i dependent activation observed with maize PDRP [2].
In comparing the E. coli PSRP to other DUF299-family
members, E. coli PSRP resembles maize PDRP in that it
catalyses both the ADP-dependent inactivation and the
Pi-dependent activation of its substrate enzyme. This is
in contrast to one of the two Arabidopsis PDRP isozymes that have been reported [4], one of which catalyses both the inactivation and activation reactions while
the second isozyme catalyzes only the inactivation
reaction.
Substrate specificity of E. coli PSRP and maize leaf PDRP

Experiments were conducted in which E. coli PSRP was
replaced with bacterially-expressed maize PDRP [3]; no
ADP/ATP-dependent inactivation of E. coli PEPS was
detected (results not shown). Furthermore, no ADP/
ATP-dependent inactivation was detected in reciprocal

experiments in which E. coli PEPS was replaced with
maize PPDK.
The fact that E. coli PEPS activity is regulated by PSRP
may be important in light of experiments in which
potato plants were transformed with an active E. coli
PEPS in an attempt to increase the photosynthetic CO2
assimilation rates [14]; no increases in photosynthetic
CO2 assimilation rates were detected. E. coli PEPS was
introduced into potato (a C3 plant) in attempts to introduce an operating C4 photosynthetic pathway under the
belief that the bacterial enzyme was not regulated [14].
The regulation of E. coli PEPS by AMP, ADP, oxaloacetate, a-ketoglutarate, malate, ADP-glucose and 3phosphoglyceraldehyde has been reported [15]. The
results presented in this paper provide evidence for the
existence of another level of regulation of PEPS activity.
The PSRP-dependent regulatory mechanism may be critical in controlling the metabolic direction of pyruvate
in the cell, either towards the oxidative catabolism of
pyruvate via the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex to
produce more ATP, or the anabolic conversion of pyruvate to PEP and glucose via an active PEPS. The results
in this paper indicate that the PSRP-dependent regulation of PEPS in E. coli is affected by the concentration
of three major compounds (see Figure 4); ADP, ATP
and pyruvate. This regulation is similar to the PDRPdependent regulation of PPDK in maize. In maize, ADP
is both a substrate for the inactivation of PPDK and an
inhibitor of the Pi- dependent activation of inactivated
PPDK. In contrast, ATP is not only a substrate for
PPDK but, together with pyruvate, controls the rates of
ADP-dependent inactivation of PEPS by controlling the
phosphorylation status of the catalytic histidine residue;
ADP-dependent inactivation of PEPS requires the catalytic histidine residue to be phosphorylated. The pyruvate-

Figure 2 Effect of pyruvate on the ADP-dependent inactivation
of E. coli PEP synthetase. Purified PEPS and DUF299 were
incubated in the presence of 0.65 units of PEPS, 0.5 mg DUF299, 25
mM Hepes-KOH, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT at pH 8.0. Inactivation was
initiated by adding ADP and ATP to a final concentration of 2 and
0.1 mM, respectively. Pyruvate was added at the concentrations
indicated. Experiments were conducted at least five times and the
results presented in this figure are representative of the results
obtained.

dependent inhibition of ADP-dependent inactivation of
PEPS is consistent with E. coli PEPS needing to be catalytically phosphorylated prior to inactivation. Therefore
when E. coli is grown on pyruvate or lactate as a sole
carbon source, the metabolic fate of pyruvate will be
controlled by the relative activities of pyruvate dehydrogenase and PEPS. Under elevated intracellular ADP concentrations ADP would not only inhibit PEPS activity
but also inactivate PEPS while the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex would be active. In contrast, at low ADP
concentrations, which would also indicate high ATP
concentrations, PEPS would be activated and the E1
component of the PDH complex inhibited which would
favour the anabolic conversion of pyruvate to PEP; PEP
would be available for the shikimic acid pathway in
addition to conversion to glucose.
At present, the phosphorylation status of the catalytic
histidine residue of inactivated PEPS as a substrate for
P i -dependent activation is not clear and is currently
being investigated. In maize, the form of inactivated
PPDK that is not phosphorylated on the catalytic histidine residue is the preferred substrate for Pi-dependent
activation [12].
The synthesis of PEP via PEPS is important in the biosynthesis of many commercially important chemicals;
PEP is a precursor for shikimic acid synthesis that, in

turn, is the starting material for the production of a
wide range of products including Tamiflu, an orally
effective anti-influenza agent (see [16]). E. coli, overexpressing PEPS, are widely used in the biosynthesis of
shikimic acid as is over-expression of 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonic acid 7-phosphate (DAHP) synthase
whose use can be limited by feedback inhibition. Overexpression of feedback insensitive DAHP synthase isozymes have been used in microbial syntheses of commercially important products such as aromatic amino
acids, phenylalanine and tryptophan [17]. The discovery
of the existence of a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation
mechanism that regulates PEPS activity may have to be
taken into account if PEPS and PSRP are expressed in
cells used for the synthesis of compounds dependent on
the shikimic acid pathway. And in much the same way
that feedback inhibition insensitive DAHP synthase isozymes are used in microbial based syntheses, PEPS may
need to be altered to render the enzyme insensitive to
PSRP-dependent regulation and maintain it in its active
form. The effect of altering the regulatory threonine
residue close to the catalytic histidine residue in PEPS is
currently under study.
The wide distribution of DUF299 in bacteria, the
proximity of the duf299 gene to ppdk and pps genes in
bacterial genomes, the expression of E. coli PEPS and
DUF299 and the demonstration that E. coli PEPS is subject to both ADP-dependent inactivation and Pi-dependent activation, indicate that the function of the gene
family identified as DUF299 is to control either PEPS or
PPDK activities. The DUF299 from Streptococcus agalactiae, a bacterial species possessing both PPDK and
DUF299, is currently being investigated.

Conclusions
A phylogenetic analysis of the duf299 gene, present in
most bacterial species, segregates bacterial species into
two major clades; those possessing PPDK and those possessing PEPS. Expression of the duf299 gene from E. coli
resulted in the synthesis of an enzyme that catalysed
both ADP-dependent inactivation of E. coli PEPS and
Pi-dependent activation of inactive E. coli PEPS. Experiments revealed that the PSRP from E. coli was very
similar to the PDRP from maize in that the enzyme substrate of the regulatory protein had to be catalyticallyphosphorylated before it could act as a substrate for
ADP-dependent phosphorylation. In addition, ADP
inhibited the Pi-dependent activation activity of
DUF299. The E. coli PSRP was shown to be active as a
tetramer but was not capable of catalysing either the
ADP-dependent inactivation or the Pi-dependent activation of maize leaf PPDK.
Since PSRP and PDRP are expressed in a large number of bacteria many of which are pathogenic, and since

Page 6 of 8

the enzymes are rather unique in the types of reactions
they catalyse, it may be possible to identify compounds
that may selectively inhibit the enzymes inhibiting the
synthesis of important biochemical intermediates and
ultimately inhibiting the growth of the bacteria.

Methods
Phylogenetic analysis of DUF299 amino acid sequences

DUF299 amino acid sequences were downloaded from
either GenBank or Integrated Microbial Genomes and
analysed using a neighbour joining Poisson-corrected
distance matrix method, with gaps distributed proportionally (MacVector, Accelrys).
Cloning of E. coli PEPS and PSRP

E. coli genomic DNA was amplified by PCR using EC
primers 1 and 2 (5’-GGATTGTTCCATGGCCAACAATGG-3’, 5’-GCCGCATCATTCATTATCGC-3’,
respectively) and the 2.6 kbp product ligated into
pGEM-T. DNA was amplified in NM522 cells, plasmid
DNA isolated and the DNA sequence determined
(Macrogen, Korea). Following confirmation of the DNA
sequence, plasmid DNA was digested with NcoI and
SpeI and two DNA bands isolated (a 5’-end 700 bp
NcoI-NcoI band and an 1800 bp NcoI-SpeI band. The
1800 bp NcoI-SpeI band was ligated into NcoI-SpeI
digested pROExa and the incorporation of the insert
confirmed by DNA sequencing. The pROExa containing
the insert was digested with NcoI and ligated with the
700 bp NcoI-NcoI fragment isolated from the pGEMTPEPS clone and the correct orientation of the NcoI-NcoI
insert confirmed by DNA sequencing of the resulting
plasmid.
For PSRP, E. coli genomic DNA was amplified using
PCR primers 3 and 4 (5’-GGGAAGAATTCATGGATAATGCTGTTGAT-3’ and 5’-TGATTTCAAGTGCGAGGTGTGTC-3’, respectively). The PCR product was
isolated using a Qiagen Plasmid Miniprep Kit and the
eluted DNA digested with EcoRI and SpeI. The EcoRISpeI fragment was ligated into EcoRI-SpeI digested
pROEXa overnight, NM522 cells transformed and plasmid DNA isolated from cultured colonies. The DNA
sequence of pROEXa DNA was analysed (Macrogen,
Korea).
Cloning of maize PPDK and PDRP

Maize leaf PPDK and PDRP were expressed in E. coli
and purified as previously described ([3] and [18],
respectively).
Protein expression and enzyme purification

Cells containing the pROEXa-PEPS plasmid were cultured overnight in 5 mL LBA broth (LB plus 75 μg.mL-1
ampicillin) and used to inoculate 500 mL LBA in 2 L
baffled flasks. Cultures were shaken (200 rpm) at 37°C
for 3 hr, the cultures cooled to 25°C prior to the addition of IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mM and

To measure PEPS activation, PEPS was first inactivated by incubation of PEPS with purified PSRP, ADP
and ATP as described for an inactivation reaction for 20
minutes in which time >95% of the PEPS was inactivated. The entire inactivation reaction was desalted on a
Sephadex G25 column (0.5 mm × 10 mm) equilibrated
with column buffer, and 250 μL of column eluate collected after the void volume was discarded. Aliquots (50
μL) of Sephadex G25 column eluate were added to an
equal volume of column buffer and activation initiated
by the addition of Pi (to a final concentration of 1 mM).
Aliquots (20 μL) were removed and assayed for PEPS
activity.

shaken for 24 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation
(4, 000 × g for 10 mins), resuspended in PEPS Column
buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM
MgCl2 and 10 mM b-mercaptoethanol), pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 15 mL of column buffer and
frozen at -80°C. Following thawing, cells were broken by
sonication on ice and the cell debris removed by centrifugation (40, 000 × g for 20 min). The supernatant was
filtered (22 μm filter) and loaded onto a 5 mL NickelNTA column equilibrated with buffer at a flow rate of
1.0 mL.min-1. The column was washed with buffer until
the OD280 nm decreased below 0.05, with buffer containing 20 mM imidazole until the A280 nm decreased below
0.05 and protein eluted with column buffer containing
200 mM imidazole. DTT was added to each eluted fraction (2.5 mL) to a final concentration of 10 mM and
column eluate stored at -20°C or -80°C until required.
Cells containing the pROEXa-PSRP plasmid were cultured overnight in 5 mL LBA and used to inoculate 500
mL LBA in 2 L baffled flasks. Cultures were grown for 3
h at 37°C with shaking (200 rpm), the cultures cooled to
18°C prior to the addition of IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mM. Cultures were shaken at 18°C for 4 days,
cells harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in
PSRP Column buffer containing 25 mM Hepes-KOH,
20% v/v glycerol, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2 and 10
mM b-mercaptoethanol. Cells were disrupted using a
French Press (pre-cooled to 2°C) and cell debris
removed by centrifugation at 40, 000 × g for 30 mins at
2°C. Expressed PSRP was purified by nickel affinity
chromatography as described for the purification of
PEPS.

A scaled up inactivation assay was run in which 0.2 mL
of PEPS (15 units.mL-1) was inactivated in the presence
of 0.2 mL purified E. coli PSRP and 20 mM ADP/1 mM
ATP in a total volume of 0.5 mL and PEPS inactivated
for 30 min. Less that 2.5% of the initial activity
remained after the 30 min incubation. The entire inactivation reaction mixture was loaded onto a 5 mL column
of Agarose-Blue dextran (Sigma-Aldrich) and the column washed with PEPS Column buffer. The PSRP
bound to the column while the PEPS passed through
the column and was separated from the ADP/ATP by
gel filtration. The protein concentration of eluate was
monitored at 280 nm and the protein peak collected
and used as the supply of inactive PEPS in activation
assays. The successful removal of PSRP was confirmed
by adding a 50 μL aliquot of the peak protein fraction
to a 1 mL PEPS assay mix and adding phosphate to a
final concentration of 1 mM in the assay.

Assay of enzyme activity

Catalytic phosphorylation of PEPS by PEP

PEPS was assayed spectrophotometrically in a coupled
enzyme assay in which the pyruvate-dependent production of PEP was linked to NADH oxidation via PEP carboxylase and malate dehydrogenase. All assays were
conducted at 25°C in a Beckman DU650 spectrophotometer. Reactions mixtures contained 25 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 8.0, 8 mM MgCl2, 10 mM DTT, 10 mM NaHCO3, 2
mM pyruvate, 1 mM glucose-6-phosphate, 1 mM ATP,
and 2 mM NADH, 2 units of maize leaf PEPC and 2
units of malate dehydrogenase. Reactions were initiated
by the addition of enzyme (PEPS or an aliquot of a
PSRP reaction assay).
Inactivation reactions contained between 0.5 to 1 unit
of PEPS, 25 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 8.0, 5 mM MgCl2, 5
mM DTT, 0.1 mM ATP, 2 mM ADP and a variable
amount of PSRP in a total volume of 0.2 mL. Inactivation reactions were initiated by the addition of ADP/
ATP and 20 μL aliquots removed at different time intervals and the PEPS activity measured as described above.

In experiments in which the PEPS was catalytically
phosphorylated in the presence of PEP, 2 units of PEPS
in PEPS Column buffer was incubated with 5 mM PEP
for 20 mins at room temperature and the PEP removed
from the PEPS by Sephadex G25 column
chromatography.

Isolation of inactivated PEPS

Determination of the native molecular weight of PSRP

A 0.5 mL sample of the fraction with the highest ADPdependent PEPS inactivation activity eluted from the
nickel-NTA column was loaded onto a column (1.5 cm
× 60.0 cm) of Sephacryl-S200 equilibrated with PSRP
Column buffer and 2.0 mL fractions collected at a flow
rate of 0.5 mL.min-1. The column was calibrated with
lactate dehydrogenase (MW 140, 000), malate dehydrogenase (MW 67, 000) and bovine erythrocyte carbonic
anhydrase (MW 30, 000). Lactate dehydrogenase and
malate dehydrogenase were assayed spectrophotometrically at 340 nm and carbonic anhydrase was measured
by monitoring the change in pH [19].
