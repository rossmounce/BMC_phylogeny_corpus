Abstract
Background: Phagocytosis, that is, engulfment of large particles by eukaryotic cells, is found in
diverse organisms and is often thought to be central to the very origin of the eukaryotic cell, in
particular, for the acquisition of bacterial endosymbionts including the ancestor of the
mitochondrion.
Results: Comparisons of the sets of proteins implicated in phagocytosis in different eukaryotes
reveal extreme diversity, with very few highly conserved components that typically do not possess
readily identifiable prokaryotic homologs. Nevertheless, phylogenetic analysis of those proteins for
which such homologs do exist yields clues to the possible origin of phagocytosis. The central finding
is that a subset of archaea encode actins that are not only monophyletic with eukaryotic actins but
also share unique structural features with actin-related proteins (Arp) 2 and 3. All phagocytic
processes are strictly dependent on remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and the formation of
branched filaments for which Arp2/3 are responsible. The presence of common structural features
in Arp2/3 and the archaeal actins suggests that the common ancestors of the archaeal and
eukaryotic actins were capable of forming branched filaments, like modern Arp2/3. The Rho family
GTPases that are ubiquitous regulators of phagocytosis in eukaryotes appear to be of bacterial
origin, so assuming that the host of the mitochondrial endosymbiont was an archaeon, the genes
for these GTPases come via horizontal gene transfer from the endosymbiont or in an earlier event.
Conclusion: The present findings suggest a hypothetical scenario of eukaryogenesis under which
the archaeal ancestor of eukaryotes had no cell wall (like modern Thermoplasma) but had an actinbased cytoskeleton including branched actin filaments that allowed this organism to produce actinsupported membrane protrusions. These protrusions would facilitate accidental, occasional
engulfment of bacteria, one of which eventually became the mitochondrion. The acquisition of the
endosymbiont triggered eukaryogenesis, in particular, the emergence of the endomembrane
system that eventually led to the evolution of modern-type phagocytosis, independently in several
eukaryotic lineages.

Background
It is universally accepted that mitochondria and related
organelles, that so far have been discovered in all eukaryotes studied in sufficient detail, have evolved via endosymbiosis, most likely, a single endosymbiotic event that
involved an alpha-proteobacterium, the apparent ancestor of the mitochondria [1-4]. However, the place of the
mitochondrial endosymbiosis in the course of eukaryogenesis and the nature of the host of the alpha-proteobacterial endosymbiont remain hotly debated matters
[1,5,6]. Under the so-called archezoan hypothesis, the
organism that acquired the endosymbiont was a protoeukaryote (dubbed the archezoan) that already possessed
the nucleus, the endomembrane system, the cytoskeleton,
and other hallmark structures of the eukaryotic cell
[5,7,8]. In other words, the hypothetical archezoan is
envisaged as an amitochondrial, unicellular eukaryotic
organism. The major difficulty faced by the archezoan
hypothesis is that so far all candidate archezoa, such as
Diplomonada, Parabasalia, and Microsporidia, have been
shown to possess organelles derived from or, at least,
related to mitochondria (hydrogenosomes, mitosomes,
and others) as well as some nuclear genes of apparent
mitochondrial (alpha-proteobacterial) origin [1,6]. Thus,
the proponents of the archezoan hypothesis are forced to
postulate that the archezoa represent an extinct lineage of
primitive eukaryotes [8].
The hypotheses that oppose the archezoan concept are
symbiotic scenarios in which the mitochondrial endosymbiosis is seen as the event that triggered eukaryogenesis in the first place. This idea traces back to the classic
1967 paper of Sagan (Margulis) [4] but received a major
boost from the discovery of mitochondria-related
organelles and genes of apparent mitochondrial origin in
all thoroughly characterized eukaryotic cells [1,9,10].
Under the symbiotic scenarios that differ in details, the
host that engulfed the alpha-proteobacterial ancestor of
the mitochondria is posited to have been not a protoeukaryote but rather an archaeon that closely resembled
the currently known archaea, at least, in terms of the cell
organization [1,11-13]. The advantage of the symbiotic
scenarios is that they provide plausible, even if rather general explanations for the origin of the remarkable organizational and functional complexity of the eukaryotic cell
as a result of diverse interactions between the host and the
endosymbiont. However, the potentially serious difficulty
faced by these scenarios is that prokaryotes have no
known mechanisms for engulfing other prokaryotic cells
(although at least one case of endosymbiosis among bacteria has been reported [14]). Thus, under these scenarios,
the symbiosis between two prokaryotic cells would
depend on an extremely rare, if not unique, spurious
event – the "fateful encounter" hypothesis using the memorable phrase of De Duve [15].

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/9

By contrast, many cells in a variety of eukaryotes possess
elaborate mechanisms for the internalization of bacteria
and other large particles, collectively named phagocytosis
[16]. In some unicellular eukaryotes, such as amoebas,
phagocytosis can lead to the establishment of new endosymbiotic relationships [17]. Accordingly, adepts of the
archezoan hypothesis of eukaryogenesis maintain that the
amitochondrial protoeukaryotes have already evolved the
phagocytic capacity [18] – the "primitive phagocyte"
hypothesis according to De Duve [15]. This cellular function would provide the protoeukaryotes with the possibility of numerous trials and errors in their relationship with
bacteria, so that one of these trials would end up in the
acquisition of the proto-mitochondrion that would allow
the mitochondrial eukaryotes to outcompete the primitive, amitochondrial forms (which is why, under this scenario, the latter are no longer around) [19].
Thus, the origin of phagocytosis appears to be one of the
key aspects of eukaryogenesis, and reconstruction of the
evolution of the phagocytic function could substantially
inform our thinking on the origin of the eukaryotic cell
and, in particular, might help to distinguish between the
archezoan and symbiotic scenarios.
Phagocytosis is defined as internalization of particles
larger than 0.4 μm in diameter [20]. Phagocytosis serves
diverse functions, from feeding on bacteria in various unicellular eukaryotes [21,22], to apoptotic sell removal [23],
tissue remodeling, and immune defense in animals
[16,24-28]. Plant cells are not phagocytic owing to their
rigid cell walls. However, the engulfment of rhizobia symbionts into root hairs occurs via a phagocytic mechanism
[29]. Other cases of bacterial-plant symbioses involve
mechanisms of entry that are apparently distinct from
phagocytosis [30]. To date no phagocytosis has been
reported in fungi, with the interesting exception of the
basal parasitic fungus Rozella allomycis that was reported to
phagocytose organelles of its host [31].
Phagocytosis (uptake of large particles) is a distinct form
of the more general mechanism, endocytosis (uptake of
extracellular substances), the other form of which is pinocytosis, the uptake of solutes and small particles [32]. In
addition to the classic phagocytosis, many eukaryotes are
capable of macropinocytosis, a process that is characterized by the formation of large compartments of irregular
size. During macropinocytosis, the ingested particle initiates ruffling of the adjacent area of the plasma membrane;
the mechanism induced mainly by phosphatidylserine
(PS); in contrast, "classic" phagocytosis occurs by tight
flow-over of the plasma membrane on the particle surface
("zipper" model) [25]. Unlike phagocytosis, macropinocytosis yields spacious compartments in which extracellular liquid is internalized along with a bacterial or

apoptotic cell. Importantly, both macropinocytosis and
phagocytosis depend on the formation of membrane protrusions supported by actin filaments, whereas other types
of endocytosis occur by membrane invagination.
Phagocytosis depends on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
compartments in a complex manner. An early phagosome
has been reported to fuse, consecutively, with the early/
sorting/recycling endosome, late endosome and lisosome
[20,33]. The ER involvement in phagocytosis was also
supported by the study of the Ap1 protein that is required
for endocytic vesicle formation: Ap1-mutant Dictyostelium
cells showed defects in the phagocytosis and macropinocytosis, but not in cell adhesion [34]. However, evidence to
the contrary was presented as well: the absence of visible
internal vesicle fusion and the existence of a continuous
layer of F-actin surrounding the phagocytotic cup have
been interpreted as indications that fusion between the
phagosome and ER compartments was unlikely [35].
Phagocytosis is one of the numerous and diverse actindependent processes that occur in all eukaryotic cells.
Actin polymerization requires one or more of the following assembly factors: (i) the Arp2/3 complex that consists
of 7 distinct subunits and produces branched filaments
(actin network, or mesh) and is activated by either WASp/
N-WASp or Scar/WAVE proteins; (ii) formins that produce
linear filaments and are activated by profilin; (iii) spire
that contains four WASP homology domains and also
produces linear filaments [36]. Actin filaments comprise
the structural basis of at least 15 distinct structures in
metazoan cells including sheet-like protrusions such as
lamellipodia and lamella (with the involvement of Arp2/
3, formins, cortactin, ADF/cofilin, and Scar/WAVE [37]),
ruffles (Arp2/3, formins, RhoA, Scar/WAVE), phagocytic
cups (Arp2/3, formins, Scar/WAVE or WASp/N-WASp),
finger-like protrusions such as filopodia [require formins
and, possibly, Arp2/3 for the assembly of parallel filaments but do not require WASp proteins, and pits including those involved in clathrin-dependent endocytosis
(require Arp 2/3, N-WASP and other proteins, and in caveolin-dependent endocytosis (caveolin, flotillin) [36]). In
addition, actin polymerization is required for membrane
traffic, cytokinesis, focal adhesion structures, exocytosis
[38]. Despite the high variability of phagocytosis mechanisms, they share the same mechanism of actin polymerization that requires the input of the Arp2/3 complex,
WASp/WAVE proteins, and Rho GTPases as key regulators
[28].
Many pathogens exploit the phagocytic abilities of eukaryotic cells for the entry into the host cell. Although bacteria
utilize different invasive strategies, and entry sites show
different morphology, triggering actin polymerization via

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/9

Rac, Cdc42, WASp or WAVE, and the Arp2/3 complex
seems to be a common denominator for all cases [39,40].
Owing to the universality of molecular mechanisms of
cytoskeleton-driven processes, there are notable similarities between phagocytosis and some of these other processes. The generation of the phagocytic cup has been
compared mechanistically to the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia, a process that requires actin nucleation
on the membrane face [37,41]. Membrane-associated signaling GTPases, Rac, Rho or cdc42, recruit and activate
nucleation-promoting factors (NPF), such as the WiskottAldrich syndrome protein (WASP), which in turn bind the
ARP2/3 complex [42,43]. The Arp2/3 complex then nucleates the assembly of an actin filament. The critical role of
this cascade has been demonstrated experimentally
through the inhibition of both C3- and IgG-mediated
phagocytosis by overexpression of the Arp 2/3 activating
fragment of the NFP Scar1 [44]. The phagosome formation also requires cofilin which severs actin filaments and
generates new barbed-ends for elongation. The two processes are thought to occur synergistically to facilitate active
ruffling that occurs during the phagocytic process [45].
Chemotaxis in eukaryotes also shares common features
with phagocytosis [46], namely, the central role of actin
polymerization (Chen et al., 2003) that involves regulation by Rho family GTPases and Wasp activation of Arp2/
3 [47] as well as regulation by phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(PI3K) [48].
Phagocytosis (at least, the CR3-mediated form) has been
viewed as an adapted cell-adhesion mechanism [24].
Talin, vinculin, paxillin and focal adhesion kinase (FAK)
are adhesion proteins that might also be involved in
phagocytosis [24]. Furthermore, phagocytosis is regulated
via many of the same pathways that are involved in cell
adhesion mechanisms and rely on a distinct set of regulatory proteins including Rho, Rac, Cdc42, Src-kinases, Arf6,
and PI3K [49-51]. It even has been proposed that cell
spreading during adhesion represents abortive phagocytosis of an infinitely large virtual particle. Indeed, recent
genetic studies have confirmed that adhesion and motility
were impaired in many of the same mutants of Dictyostelium discoideum and Caenorhabditis elegans that displayed
defects in phagocytosis, and vice versa [49].
As with other organelles, proteomics of phagosomes isolated from diverse organisms provides for a detailed characterization of the protein machinery that is involved in
phagocytosis. In principle, comparative proteomic
approaches should allow researchers to identify phagosomal proteins that are conserved in different species and
to track changes in the protein content during phagosome
maturation [52]. However, the differentiation between

the true phagosomal components and contaminants
remains a difficult problem. Furthermore, many proteins
that play important roles in phagocytosis are only transiently associated with the phagosome, and so could
escape detection by proteomic methods.
With the ultimate goal of gaining insight into the origin of
the eukaryotic cell and making inroads into distinguishing between the "primitive phagocyte" and "fateful
encounter" models, we compared 7 available phagosome
proteomes from 5 diverse eukaryotes, examined the
phyletic distributions of major proteins involved in
phagocytosis, and investigated the phylogenies of two key
protein groups that have readily identifiable prokaryotic
homologs, namely, the actin-related family and the Ras
superfamily of small GTPases. We use the results of this
analysis to propose a tentative scenario for the origin of
phagocytosis in relation to the origin of eukaryotes.

Results
The core set of proteins involved in phagocytosis identified
by comparison of the proteomics results
To delineate the complement of the evolutionarily conserved protein components of the phagosome, we compared the sets of proteins identified in proteomic studies
of phagosomes isolated from mouse macrophages
[53,54], Drosophila S2 cells [55], Dictyostelium discoideum
[56], Entamoeba histolytica [57,58], and Tetrahymena thermophila [59]. Altogether, these studies yielded approximately 2000 proteins associated with the phagosomes.
We first clustered these proteins into sets of likely
orthologs by mapping them to eukaryotic clusters of
orthologous domains (KODs; [60]). Proteins that
mapped to the same KOD were considered orthologous.
With this approach, over 900 sets of orthologous phagosomal proteins were identified. However, the level of conservation of phagosomal proteomes, as revealed by the
comparison of the protein sets identified in the proteomic
analyses, was surprisingly low: 118 proteins were detected
in at least 3 of the 5 organisms for which proteomic analysis of phagosomes has been reported, of which 29 proteins were found in 4 species, and only 9 proteins were
seen in all 5 species (Tables 1, 2 and 3, Additional File 1
and Additional File 2) [58,61-103]. This lack of phylogenetic coherence could be due to the imperfect detection of
phagosomal proteins with the applied proteomics methods, the substantial variability of the phagocytosis
machinery or, most likely, by a combination of both these
factors. For instance, actin-related protein 3 (Arp3) was
identified only in 3 of the 5 species, and actin-related protein 2 (Arp2) was detected in only one species (and therefore failed to make the list of phagosomal proteins that
was automatically compiled for the purpose of the present
study). As there is no reasonable doubt that the Arp2/3
complex is engaged in phagocytosis in all phagocytic

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/9

organisms, these discrepancies point to the limitations of
the proteomic analysis. Conversely, even interstrain differences in the phagosome composition, apparently, can
be substantial. For instance, proteomic analysis of phagosomes isolated from the laboratory strain of Entamoeba
histolytica and two clinical isolates of the same species
yielded only ~20% of common proteins in all three
strains; given that the proteomic analysis was performed
by the same method and on essentially identical amoeba
cultures, it appears extremely unlikely that most of these
differences are proteomic artifacts [57].
As phagocytosis depends on cytoskeleton remodeling, it
was not unexpected to find actin, tubulin, non-muscle
myosin, and several actin-binding proteins among the
conserved phagosomal proteins. In addition, several signaling GTPases and their effectors are conserved as well.
The small GTPases are mostly represented by the Rab family members that are involved in vesicular fusion and trafficking. Because these proteins are associated with
endosomes, it is difficult to distinguish whether they regulate phagocytosis itself or are recruited to the phagosome
membrane as the result of phagosomal-endosomal
fusion. The presence of several lysosomal proteins in the
conserved phagosomal set is likely to reflect the fusion of
the phagosome with the lysosome which contributes both
its membrane (hence the presence of V-ATPase) and its
compartment (hence hydrolytic enzymes) to the maturing phagosome. Surprisingly, one soluble, cytosolic
hydrolase (S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase) was also
identified. Several proteins characteristic of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) were detected; this observation reflects
the apparent role of ER in phagosome formation and/or
maturation. Components of the TCP1-ring chaperonin
complex that mediates the folding of various cytoplasmic
proteins including actin and tubulin, as well as the HSP70
and HSP90 chaperones (heat shock proteins), whose role
in endocytosis has been demonstrated, also belonged to
the conserved phagosomal protein set. In addition, and
unexpectedly, this set included numerous ribosomal proteins, translation elongation factors, and several mitochondrial and metabolic proteins.
Obviously, the collections of phagosomal proteins identified by proteomic approaches include numerous false
positives and false negatives. The false-positive group
seems to consist, primarily, of some of the abundant
cytosolic and organellar proteins that contaminate the
isolated phagosomes. The false-negative group would
include proteins that, although functionally important,
only transiently associate with the phagosome, and therefore, escape detection by proteomics. Accordingly, we
attempted to correct and extend the list of phagosomal
proteins by including proteins that have not been consistently detected by proteomics but whose role in phagocy-

tosis has been convincingly demonstrated in at least two
organisms, and excluding proteins without concrete functional roles in phagocytosis.
The major proteins involved in phagocytosis and their
phyletic distribution: the conserved actin-centered core of
phagocytosis
The phyletic distribution of proteins whose role in phagocytosis has been documented experimentally (and, in
many cases, supported by proteomic analysis) was characterized by sequence similarity search (Tables 1, 2, 3, Additional File 3 and Additional File 4). These proteins fall
into several distinct functional categories among which a
gradient of evolutionary conservation is seen from the
"periphery" to the "center" of the phagocytosis machinery
(Tables 1, 2, 3, Additional File 3 and Additional File 4).
Despite the often propounded view that phagocytosis is
an evolutionarily conserved mechanism [104], molecular
details of this process are remarkably variable between
species and different types of phagocytosis. Receptors are
a poorly conserved part of the phagocytic machinery:
indeed, no universal phagocytic receptors have been identified (Table 1). The key regulators including actin-remodeling proteins (Table 2), and small GTPases of the Rho
family (Table 3) are conserved to a greater extent although
non-orthologous displacement is observed, e.g., RhoA
and Cdc42 appear to be mutually exclusive as regulators
of different types of phagocytosis (see also Additional File
3).

Actin, the actin nucleation complex Arp2/3 and its regulators WASP/N-WASP or WAVE/SCAR, and actin-binding
proteins that are involved in remodeling of actin filaments, such as gelsolin, profilin, cofilin, formin, and
coronin, comprise the structural core of phagocytosis that
is conserved in (nearly) all eukaryotes (Table 2). The
(near) universality of these components is manifest both
in their presence in all phagocytic organisms and in their
involvement in all types of phagocytosis. The actinremodeling machinery involved in phagocytosis is the
same as that functioning in other cytoskeleton-driven
processes such as cell motility, adhesion, and clathrinmediated endocytosis. Thus, the results of the phylogenomic analysis of phagocytosis suggest that the actin-centered core of the phagocytic machinery that is represented
in (nearly) all eukaryotes was present in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) in, essentially, the modern
form. By contrast, the rest of the phagosome components
cannot be mapped to LECA.
Thus, understanding the origin of phagocytosis and the
other processes that involve actin remodeling requires the
elucidation of the evolutionary histories of this set of
actin-associated proteins, as well as the key regulators of
phagocytosis. In particular, the prokaryotic connections

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/9

and likely prokaryotic roots of these proteins are of critical
importance. The majority of the proteins involved in
phagocytosis have no prokaryotic homologs or have only
distant connections (such as a common structural fold) at
the level of individual domains that are, clearly, not
informative in phylogenetic analysis (Tables 1, 2, 3). In
particular, despite an exhaustive search, no prokaryotic
homologs were detected for 4 of the 5 accessory subunits
of the ARP2/3 complex that are highly conserved in all
eukaryotes. The major exceptions are the proteins of the
actin family and the small regulatory GTPases of the Rho
family as well as protein kinases. The first two groups of
proteins are essential for all forms of phagocytosis and
other cytoskeleton-related processes, so we investigated
their likely origins in detail.
The archaeal ancestry of actins
Bacteria and archaea encode well-characterized proteins
homologous to actin such as MreB, FtsA, ParM, and
MamK [105-107]. MreB is essential for rod-shape maintenance and chromosome partitioning of bacteria, FtsA
interacts with the tubulin-like FtsZ ring and is involved in
cell division, whereas ParM (StbA) is a plasmid-encoded
protein required for segregation. The MreB and ParM proteins are structurally similar to actin and polymerize to
form filaments [108,109]. The MamK protein is essential
for the spatial organization of magnetosomes and also
forms filamentous structures [110].

The sequence similarity between actins and their closest
bacterial homologs, MreB and FtsA, is extremely low
despite the conservation of the main structural elements
of the RNAseH/HSP70 fold and the amino acid residues
that are essential for the ATPase activity [105]. This limited sequence conservation parallels the case of tubulin
that is weakly similar to the bacterial/archaeal homolog,
FtsZ, and sharply contrasts the high level of conservation
between eukaryotic and bacterial Hsp70 chaperones, proteins that possess the same core fold as actins. Considering the central importance of the cytoskeleton for the very
existence of eukaryotic cells, deciphering the underlying
causes of the dramatic sequence divergence between actin
(and tubulin) is central to the understanding of eukaryotic origins. At least, two distinct although not necessarily
incompatible hypotheses can be considered.
1. The low sequence conservation, largely, reflects the fact
that MreB and actin (as well as FtsZ and tubulin) diverged
from their common ancestor at a very early stage of evolution, prior to the divergence of eukaryotes and bacteria
from their last common ancestor [106,111]. By contrast,
under this scenario, Hsp70, like many eukaryotic proteins
of bacterial origin, was acquired subsequent to the mitochondrial endosymbiosis.

2. The low sequence conservation is a consequence of a
dramatic acceleration of evolution of actin that was triggered by the major functional switch associated with the
origin of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton.
Unlike the well-characterized bacterial homologs of actin,
archaeal actin-like proteins have not been studied in
detail. The only archaeal actin homolog for which both
the crystal structure [112] and a biochemical characterization [113] have been reported is the Ta0583 protein from
the euryarchaeon Thermoplasma acidophilum. Although
this protein shows the greatest sequence similarity to
ParM and MreB of various bacteria, it has been noticed
that the biochemical properties of this protein resemble
those of eukaryotic actins. In particular, the T. acidophilum
protein formed helical filaments like actins, in contrast to
MreB that polymerizes into sheet-shaped structures [113].
Crenarchaeota of the order Thermoproteales and the only
sequenced genome of Korarchaeum [114] encode functionally uncharacterized actin homologs that are significantly more similar to eukaryotic actins than to bacterial
or euryarchaeal MreB-like proteins (for instance, the actinlike protein of Candidatus Korarchaeum cryptophilum
showed a highly significant similarity, with e-values
below 10-8, to a variety of eukaryotic actins, whereas the
similarity to bacterial homologs was not statistically significant). Thus, these crenarchaeal and korarchaeal proteins could be classified as archaeal actin-like proteins
rather than MreB-like proteins. The presence of actin-like
proteins in a single branch of Crenarchaeota and in the
distantly related Korarchaeum suggests that the functional
change associated with accelerated evolution that led to
the emergence of the actin family occurred in one of those
of these groups, and the actin-like protein gene was horizontally transferred to the other group. An alternative evolutionary scenario that would involve multiple gene losses
appears less parsimonious. Of course, one has to keep in
mind that the current genomic collection is unlikely to be
a full representation of the actual diversity of the archaea
[115], so this scenario might need revision in the future.
In order to gain further insight into the relationships
between eukaryotic actin protein family and their
prokaryotic homologs, we reexamined the phylogeny of
actins and actin-like proteins, with HSP70 family used as
the outgroup. The HSP70 family is the group of proteins
with the closest similarity to the actin family and thus an
obvious choice for an outgroup to infer the root position
in this tree although it remains uncertain whether HSP70
was present in the Last Universal Common Ancestor
(LUCA) of modern cellular life or has a bacterial origin
[116,117]. The resulting tree has bacterial proteins of the
MreB family as the basal branch, followed by the MamK
and ParM-StbA branches that also consist primarily of

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/9

bacterial but also some archaeal (like the experimentally
characterized Ta0583) proteins. The actin family proper
that includes archaeal and eukaryotic actin-like proteins
(and actins) is the sister group of the ParM-StbA group
(Fig. 1). This topology seems to be best compatible with
an ancient acquisition of the progenitor of the actin family by an archaeon via HGT from bacteria, perhaps, via a
plasmid that encoded a ParM-StbA family protein.
Regardless of exact evolutionary scenario and of which (if
any) of these proteins were present in LUCA, the tree
strongly supports the hypothesis that the crenarchaeal and
korarchaeal actin-like proteins are the closest prokaryotic
homologs of the eukaryotic actin family (Figure 1 and
Additional file 5). By contrast, euryarchaeal actin-like proteins including the experimentally characterized Ta0583
clustered within the MreB and ParM branches, suggesting
multiple horizontal gene transfers between bacteria and
archaea. Within the eukaryotic branch of the tree, the
Arp3 clade is the first to branch off the trunk, followed by
the divergence of the actins and Arp2 (Figure 1).
We then examined in detail the multiple alignment of
selected representatives of the main groups of actin-superfamily proteins in search of possible derived shared characters (synapomorphies) Notably, despite the relatively
low overall sequence conservation, we identified two
homologous (as indicated by the amino acid residue conservation in several alignment positions) inserts that are
shared between the archaeal and eukaryotic actin-like proteins; an additional conserved region that is missing in the
MreB-like proteins is located near the C-termini of these
proteins (Figure 2). These inserts appear to qualify as
derived shared characters strongly supporting the monophyly of the archaeal and eukaryotic actins and actin-like
proteins that is suggested by the topology of the phylogenetic tree (Figure 1). In addition, both archaeal actins and
Arp3 possess unique inserts that are missing in eukaryotic
actins (Figure 2).
The topology of the phylogenetic tree in Figure 1 and the
presence of shared and similar structural features in
archaeal actins could have structural and functional implications for the archaeal actin-like proteins and the ancestral forms. Structural comparison of actin, Arp2 and Arp3
shows that actin is a very compact molecule whereas Arp2
and, especially, Arp3 possess various extended loops
between the core structural elements ([118] and Figure 2).
The archaeal actin-like proteins have, approximately, the
same overall lengths as Arp3, with some shared and some
unique inserts (Figure 2). The topology of the tree in Figure 1 seems to determine the vector of evolution: the
ancestral state was a molecule with extended loops,
resembling Arp3, and the subsequent evolution involved
loss of inserts resulting in tightening of the actin fold.
Actin efficiently polymerizes from both ends to form bidi-

rectionally growing filaments. In Arp2 and, especially,
Arp3, the extended surface loops, in particular, the loop
containing Insert 2, partially obstruct polymerization,
producing filaments that grow unidirectionally from the
so-called barbed end of the Arp3 molecule [118,119]. In
extant eukaryotes, the major function of the Arp2/3 complex is the production of branched actin filament networks. This process occurs through lateral binding of the
Arp2/3 complex to preexisting actin filaments, which is
facilitated by WASp/Scar proteins, and the nucleation of
the unidirectional elongation of a branch where Arp2 and
Arp3 form the first two subunits [118-120]. Obviously,
this complex system that, in part, is based on the structural and functional differentiation of actin from the Arps,
is missing in extant archaea and could not have been
present in the putative ancestral organism that encoded
the common ancestor of actins and Arps (Figure 1). The
apparent structural similarity between the archaeal actins
and Arp2/3 (Figure 2) suggests that the polymerization
capacity of the ancestral actin-like protein could have
been similar to that of Arp3 [118-120]. Thus, it is conceivable that the relatively inefficient formation of filament
networks is the ancestral functional modality of actin-like
proteins.
The bacterial roots of eukaryotic small GTPases
At least three members of the Rho-family of small
GTPases (RhoA, Rac, Cdc42) are important regulators of
actin polymerization that is required, among other
cytoskeleton-related processes, for phagocytosis (Table 3).
The Rho family is one of the 7 eukaryotic GTPase families
that collectively comprise the Ras superfamily [121,122].
Bacterial small GTPases of the MglA family appeared to be
the closest prokaryotic relatives of the Ras GTPases [121]
and were used to root the Ras phylogenetic tree [122]
prior to the recent discovery of a set of previously
unknown, closer prokaryotic Ras homologs [123]. The
inclusion of these new proteins in the phylogenetic analysis affected the topology of the Ras superfamily tree, raising the question of two independent prokaryotic origins
of the eukaryotic Ras GTPases [123]. We performed a
comprehensive search for prokaryotic Ras homologs by
running position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) constructed from multiple alignments of each of the 7 families of eukaryotic Ras GTPases [123] against archaeal and
bacterial sequences in the RefSeq database using PSIBLAST [124]. By combining sequence similarity and phylogenetic analysis, we identified 67 (predicted) GTPases
(61 bacterial and 6 archaeal; some of these are larger proteins containing GTPase domain and leucine-rich repeats)
that appeared to be the closest relatives of the Rab, Ran,
Ras, and Rho families (Additional files 6 and 7 and Figure
3). Considering the paucity of these GTPases in archaea,
which sharply contrasts their wide spread among diverse
bacteria, and the fact that the eukaryotic small GTPases are

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/9

embedded within the bacterial part of the tree (Figure 3),
it appears most likely that the common ancestor of the
Rab, Ran, Ras, and Rho families was of bacterial origin
and was acquired by some archaea and by the ancestors of
eukaryotes via HGT, in the latter case, most likely, as a
result of endosymbiosis.

Discussion
Comparisons of the complements of proteins that are
associated with phagosomes or otherwise implicated in
phagocytosis in different eukaryotes show a high level of
diversity, with very few components being conserved
throughout the eukaryotic domain of life. This lack of evolutionary conservation sharply contrasts the results
reported in similar comparative analyses of other signature cellular systems of eukaryotic cells, such as the
nuclear pore [125,126] or the spliceosome [127], and suggests late, multiple origins for the full-fledged phagocytosis systems. Very few proteins involved in phagocytosis
possess readily identifiable prokaryotic homologs with
sequence conservation sufficient for phylogenetic analysis
(Tables 1, 2, 3), and those that do are not specific to
phagocytosis, but rather, are generic cytoskeleton components and regulators. Nevertheless, phylogenetic analysis
of these conserved proteins leads to intriguing conclusions.
The central finding described here is that some of the Crenarchaeota and Korarchaeota possess actin-like proteins
that are not only monophyletic with the eukaryotic actin
family but also are structurally similar to Arp2/3 in that
they contain multiple, extended inserts between core
structural elements that are missing in eukaryotic actins.
In Arp2 and, especially, Arp3, these inserts partially
obstruct polymerization and prevent rapid, bidirectional
elongation of filaments that is characteristic of eukaryotic
actins. Considering these observations and the tree topology of the actin superfamily (Figure 1), we suggest that the
ancestral actin-like proteins' capacity for filament formation was similar to that of Arp3, that is, these proteins
formed networks of branched filaments, probably, with a
relatively low efficiency.
As shown by comparative-genomic and phylogenetic
analysis, the Rho family GTPases that are ubiquitous regulators of phagocytosis in eukaryotes appear to be of bacterial origin, an observation that is compatible with either
of the two alternative scenarios: (i) there was no Rho-regulated phagocytosis before the engulfment of the future
mitochondrial endosymbiont, and (ii) a small GTPase(s)
was acquired by the future host of the protomitochondrion in a separate, earlier HGT event.
Together, these findings lead to an admittedly speculative
scenario for the origin and role of the phagocytic capacity

in the general context of eukaryogenesis (Figure 4). Under
this model, the organism that acquired the mitochondrial
endosymbiont was an archaeon without a cell wall that
morphologically might resemble the extant Thermoplasma
and possessed an actin-like-protein based cytoskeleton in
the form of filament networks. The branched-filament
cytoskeleton allowed the hypothetical archaeal ancestor
of eukaryotes to produce actin-supported membrane protrusions, resembling eukaryotic lamellipodia/filopodia,
thus facilitating occasional engulfment of bacteria. One of
such occasions would eventually lead to the mitochondrial endosymbiosis. Conceptually, this process can be

regarded as the simplest, primordial form of phagocytosis.
Indeed, it has been shown that some bacteria enter the
host eukaryotic cell by inducing protrusions of the host
plasma membrane [128]. This model, essentially, takes
the middle ground between the "primitive phagocyte"
and "fateful encounter" scenarios of endosymbiosis: it is
proposed that the archaeal host had no full-fledged
phagocytosis but did possess a primitive mechanism for
the engulfment of other prokaryotic cells. Such an ability
would substantially increase the frequency of engulfment
and the likelihood that a stable enosymbiosis would be
established. Thus, this model is generally compatible with

the hypotheses which portray the protoeukaryote as a
predator or scavenger that fed on other prokaryotes
[18,104,129]; however, compared, say, to modern amoebas, this would be a rather ineffective predator. Clearly,
this scenario is also compatible with the earlier "you are
what you eat" idea of Doolittle according to which the
protoeukaryote continuously acquired diverse genes from
bacteria engulfed as food or transient endosymbionts
[19].
A specific relationship between eukaryotes and Thermoplasma has been suggested on the basis of the results of
supertree analysis [130] but a recent comprehensive phylogenetic study suggests that the archaeal "parent" of
eukaryotes, most likely, belonged to a deep branch of
archaea that lies outside the currently known archaeal
diversity [60]. The observed distribution of actin
homologs is compatible with this view in that the eukaryotic-type actin-like proteins are not seen in Euryarchaeota
but are present in two other distinct, major branches of
archaea, namely, a subset of Crenarchaeota and Korarchaeota. Thus, we hypothesize that the host cell that
engulfed the future mitochondrion was a mesophilic
archaeon that belonged to a still unknown, deep archaeal
branch and possessed an actin-like protein capable of
forming networks of filaments. The alternative assignment of the archaeal root of eukaryotes to Crenarchaeota
(eocytes) that is suggested by some phylogenetic analyses
[131-133] would imply that the actin-like proteins
emerged within this archaeal phylum and that the
archaeal parent of eukaryotes was a mesophilic crenarchaeon As seen with modern mesophilic archaea, such as
Methanosarcina [134,135], an archaeon with such a life
style (regardless of its exact phylogenetic position) would
likely acquire a variety of bacterial genes via HGT, even
prior to the endosymbiosis, a process that might account
for the diversity of genes of apparent bacterial origin seen
in eukaryotes [2,136].
With the input of the horizontally transferred bacterial
genes and, particularly, the endosymbiont genome, RhoGTPases and some of the actin-interacting proteins (such
as ARPC1 and coronin containing the WD40 domain or
profiling containing the Rossmann-type domain that
could be a highly diverged derivative of PAS or GAF) were
recruited as regulators of actin assembly. Conceivably,
endosymbiosis would put a high premium on the evolution of the cytoskeleton that is intimately involved,
among other processes, in mitochondrial dynamics
[137,138]. The modern-type phagocytosis as well as cell
adhesion could evolve only after the endocytic system
because endomembrane delivery is required for the formation of the phagocytic cup [25]. Furthermore, the origin of phagocytosis must have succeeded the evolution of
lysosomes given that the phagosome-lysosome fusion is a

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/9

crucial step of phagocytosis in all modern phagocytic
eukaryotes [27]. In the course of the subsequent evolution, full-fledged phagocytosis seems to have evolved
independently in, at least, three of the five supergroups of
eukaryotes [139,140], namely, Unikonts (metazoa and
amoebozoa), Chromalveolata (ciliates), and Excavates
(trypanosomes).

Conclusion
The protein composition of phagosomes is highly variable among eukaryotes, suggesting that the modern-type,
advanced phagocytosis evolved independently and relatively late in the course of evolution of several major
eukaryotic lineages. However, actin, actin-related proteins, and the core set of proteins that are involved in actin
filament remodeling as well as some of the key regulatory
proteins are conserved across eukaryotes. All these proteins are required for a variety of cytoskeleton-dependent
process not for phagocytosis specifically. Among the key
proteins involved in phagocytosis, only the actin family
and the regulatory GTPases of the Ras-family have wellconserved prokaryotic orthologs. Phylogenetic analysis
and structural comparison of eukaryotic actin family proteins with archaeal actin-like proteins suggest that the
ancestral actin-like proteins could have been capable of
the formation of branched filament structures and networks. This capacity would allow the hypothetical
archaeal host of the mitochondrion to form protrusions
resembling modern eukaryotic lamellipodia or filopodia
and facilitating engulfment of other prokaryotes. Such
engulfment of bacteria would be decisive for the acquisition of the mitochondrial endosymbiont. The Ras-family
GTPases appear to be of bacterial origin and might have
been recruited for the regulation of actin filament remodeling from the endosymbiont or even earlier, via horizontal gene transfer from bacteria. Thus, under the proposed
model, a primitive process of particle engulfment by
actin-encoding archaea might antedate eukaryogenesis
whereas the full-fledged phagocytosis was a late development that occurred independently in several major
branches of eukaryotes.

Methods
Proteomic data
The Entamoeba histolytica phagoproteome analyzed in this
study consisted of 615 non-redundant proteins. The first
set contained 440 proteins from the phagosome of the
wild-type and myosin IB-overproducing strains of E. histolytica [58]. Proteins found only in the mutant phagosomes
were omitted. The second set included 249 proteins that
were identified in latex-bead containing phagosomes of
three E. histolytica strains, HM1, KU33, and HATAJI [57];
these proteins were merged with the first set, and
sequence duplicates were removed.

most similar protein sequences (best hits) were assumed
to be the phagosome proteins in the KOD database. Proteins that were assigned to the same KOD were inferred to
be orthologous. With this approach, over 900 sets of
orthologous phagosomal proteins were identified. The
118 clusters that included proteins from three or more of
the five species (Additional File 1 and Additional File 2)
were employed in the further analysis.
Protein sequence analysis
Multiple alignments of the protein sequences comprising
the 118 sets of proteins collected from the proteomic data
were constructed using MUSCLE [141] and used to construct position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) [124].
The annotations of three first hits of PSI-BLAST search
[124] against the RefSeq protein database using the

group-specific PSSMs (see Additional File 3) were used to
annotate the groups. For the list of annotated clusters, see
Additional File 1. Entrez Gene [142] was used as the main
source of comments added in some cases.
Phyletic patterns
Phyletic patterns of proteins involved in phagocytosis
(Tables 1, 2, 3 and Additional File 3) were derived using
BLAST searches of representative proteins against the RefSeq database [143]. Hit lists were manually checked; and
ambiguous hits were verified by reverse BLAST against
RefSeq. The presence of a protein in phagosome proteomes was validated by BLAST searches of representative
proteins against collected phagosome proteins. Hit lists
for the proteins listed in Tables 1, 2, 3 can be found in

acquisition and thus the extinction of pre-mitochondrial
eukaryotic lineages.

Phylogenetic analysis
The sequences for phylogenetic analysis were retrieved
from the RefSeq database [143] and aligned using MUSCLE [141]. The alignment of the actin/Hsp70 superfamily
proteins was manually edited using the structural alignment of the following representative proteins: 3DAW_A
(alpha-actin), 2BTF_A (beta-actin), 1NM1_A (Dictyostelium actin), 1K8K_B (Arp2), 1K8K_A (Arp3), 2ZGY_A
(StbA), 2FSN_A (Ta0583), 1JCF_A (MreB), and 2E8A_A
(Hsp70). Poorly conserved positions, positions including
gaps in more than one-third of the sequences, and short
(apparently, truncated owing to misannotation)
sequences were removed prior to tree computation.

Thus, the authors decided to investigate the origin of
phagocytosis by analyzing the phyletic pattern and phylogeny of proteins involved in this process.

Maximum Likelihood trees were constructed using the
TreeFinder program [145], with the estimated site rates
heterogeneity and with the WAG (Whelan and Goldman)
substitution model [146]. The Expected-Likelihood
Weights of 1,000 local rearrangements were used as confidence values of TreeFinder tree branches [147].

Reviewers' comments
Reviewer's report 1: Simonetta Gribaldo, Institut Pasteur
This paper attempts to understand the origin of phagocytosis as a key to understand eukaryotic origins. Two
hypotheses for eukaryotic origins are tested:

a) present-day eukaryotes derive from a symbiosis
between an archaeon and a bacterium.
b) present-day eukaryotes derive from an independent
evolutionary line.
The first hypothesis is often criticized because it implies
phagocytosis ability in the archaeon or bacterial host lineage (depending on hypotheses), which is not observed
today.
The second hypothesis is often criticized because it
implies origin of phagocytosis before mitochondrial

Unfortunately, they found that, of around 2000 proteins
identified by proteomic analysis in two metazoans, two
amoebozoa, one alveolate, very few are overlapping. In
fact, only 156 proteins were identified in the phagosome
proteomes of at least 3 species (authors could you please
indicate precisely which ones), and many known components of phagocytosis were not detected and many proteins not directly involved in phagocytosis were detected,
and the authors conclude that many false negatives and
false positives affect these proteomic analyses.
Thus, the authors move over to analyze 30 proteins
known to be part of phagocytic processes. Only for a few
of these are nearly universal in eukaryotes, making what
the authors define as "the functional core of phagocytosis": actin, actin nucleation complex Arp2/3 and its regulators WASP/N-WASP or WAVE/SCAR, and actin binding
proteins. If this phagocytic core was present in the LECA
why then the authors infer an imperfect phagocytosis in
the LECA? Page 11: "These proteins fall into several distinct functional categories among which a gradient of evolutionary conservation is seen from the "periphery" to the
"center" of the phagocytosis machinery (Tables 1, 2, 3,
Additional File 3 and Additional File 4)." Would the
authors please precise this point? this is not immediately
clear from table or additional files. It would be interesting
at this point that the authors show or discuss more clearly
the results of their phylogenomic analysis, i.e. map the
presence/absence of these proteins onto the tree of
eukaryotes and infer ancestrality and losses. What was the
set of phagocytic proteins present in the LECA? This is
essential to the following discussion on the origin of
phagocytosis and the claim for an imperfect phagocytosis
in the LECA and independent origins of a fully-fledged
phagocytosis in different eukaryotic lineages. For example, if a phagocytic protein is present in at least a Unikont
and Bikont it can be inferred to have been present in the
LECA and subsequently lost in the other eukaryotic lineages rather than appeared multiples times independently.
From additional figure 3 it seems that all proteins were
present in the LECA and then a few were lost independently in a few eukaryotic lineages.
I think this is essential for further discussion on the
phagocytic capacities of the LECA.
Authors' response: The presence-absence of the phagosome components in various eukaryotic lineages is noted in Tables 1, 2,

Page 18 of 26

Biology Direct 2009, 4:9

3. An explicit phylogenomic analysis with a tree etc seems
superfluous because the results are trivial, in the sense that the
components of the actin-based core are highly conserved and
can be confidently assigned to LECA whereas (almost) all of the
rest of the phagosome proteins cannot be. We added a simple
statement to that effect.
Only a few of these 30 proteins have prokaryotic homologues, i.e. actin family and small regulatory GTPases of
the Rho family. Then, the authors move over to analyze
the phylogeny of these two protein families. A phylogenetic analysis of the actin family is then performed. Could
the authors indicate how many unambiguously aligned
positions were kept for phylogenetic analysis?
What is the rationale of rooting by a distant outgroup such
as HSP70? I fear that sequence conservation is too low and
does not give any further signal but increase the branch
length and possibly provoke a long-branch attraction artifact. With the tree as presently rooted this way, you have
bacteria polyphyletic, how do the authors explain this?
Would archaea have acquired their actin-like from bacteria? If the authors conclude that archaea obtained their
actin-like proeins by HGT from bacteria, then the root is
clearly within bacteria and the authors can show the
archaeal origin of eukaryotic actin without needing to
include HSP70. One precision at this point, previously
published analyses on HSP70 (Gribaldo 1999, Philippe
1999) clearly show that eukaryotic cytosolic HSP70 is not
related to mitochondrial HSP70 and thus likely does not
derive from them. These analyses concluded that HSP70
was probably present in the LUCA and then lost in
archaea (and reacquired subsequently from bacteria),
could the authors acknowledge this and comment?
Finally, why only a few support values are shown? Could
the authors please indicate full species names with accession numbers, it is hard to understand the tree without
going back and forth to the legend and there is enough
space to do so.
Authors' response: We agree that the discussion of this tree in
the original manuscript was overly brief. It was expanded in the
revision, in particular, in the legend where all the issues with
notation are addressed. Rooting with HSP70 is fully justified:
indeed, why not given that this is the protein family that is closest to the actin family. Whether or not HSP70 was present in
LUCA is an open question as we acknowledge in the revised
manuscript. The issues with the number of aligned residues, the
labeling of branches etc are addressed in the revised figure legends and the alignment used for the tree construction is in
Additional File 8.
Regarding small GTPases, they conclude that these arose
in bacteria and their eukaryotic counterparts are of mito-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/9

chondrial origin. I have a major problem here: in the text
it is said that only 6 archaeal homologues are found
("This search identified 67 (predicted) GTPases (61 bacterial and 6 archaeal"). I see much more archaeal sequences
in the tree in figure 3. Here again, could the authors please
specify how many positions were kept for analysis? From
the tree topology I do not see how conclusions on a mitochondrial origin of these proteins are inferred. Again, is
the tree rooted and if yes how was the root chosen?
Authors' response: The tree is unrooted and shown in a pseudorooted form for convenience as indicated in the amended legend
along with the number of residues. Regarding the count of
GTPases, the original language was indeed somewhat confusing. The total number of prokaryotic members of the Rab-RanRas-Rho branch is 67 but only a subset was included in the tree
in Figure 3. This is made clear in the revision, and the complete
list is given in Additional File 6. As for the conclusions, the
one on bacterial origin of these GTPases is clear enough (both
eukaryotic and archaeal members are embedded within bacterial branches, and the cluster that includes Rab-Ran-Ras-Rho
GTPases is overwhelmingly bacterial). As for the mitochondrial
origin, this is of course more speculative but generally is the
default for eukaryotic genes of apparent bacterial origin.
General conclusions from these results are that the
archaeal ancestor of eukaryotes had no cell wall but an
actin based cytoskeleton capable of an imperfect phagocytosis, which allowed it to acquire the mitochondrion and
become a fully-fledged eukaryote. I am afraid that these
conclusions are pushed a bit too far, and are not justified
by the data presented. In order to say that the LECA had
an imperfect phagocytosis, the ancestral set of proteins
and their evolution along the eukaryotic tree should be
presented. Lack of components can also mean loss.
Authors' response: The conclusions on LECA are presented verbally. As noted above, a tree would be superfluous (and, of
course, the deep topology of the eukaryotic tree is unknown anyway).
The discussion on Arp2 and 3 and imperfect polarization
(page 19) needs to be circumstantiated by references.
Authors' response: we assume that what is intended here is
"polymerization". Relevant references already cited but added
at this specific point again.
"At face value, at least, this conclusion and, generally, the
topology of the actin tree are incompatible with the staple
of the archezoan hypothesis that the protoeukaryote
already possessed an advanced cytoskeleton similar to
that of modern eukaryotes and providing for the possibility of phagocytosis. " Why this? From the actin tree it
seems to me that the LECA possessed already Arp2, Arp3

Biology Direct 2009, 4:9

and actins. As mentioned already, this would be clearer
from a figure with a tree of eukaryotes on which presence/
absence (also of other phagocytosis proteins) is mapped.
Moreover, can the authors discuss the fact that these Arp3like proteins were lost from other archaeal lineages?
Finally, I seem to understand that the authors suggest that
the ancestor of modern archaea was a mesophilic Thermoplasma-like. This is a big statement that needs to be discussed further in the light of archaeal phylogeny.
Moreover, Crenarchaeaota and Korarchaeota that appear
to possess Arp3-like homologues are all hyperthermophiles.
Authors response: The sentence in quotes was indeed confusing
and was removed (see also response to Jekely below). We
hypothesize that the archaeal ancestor of eukaryotes was indeed
mesophilic and Thermoplasma-like in the sense of the absence
of a rigid cell wall, but not related to Thermoplasma. Perhaps,
a "big" statement but perfectly intuitive biologically. All this is
clearly stated in the manuscript, no need to expand the discussion.
Page 20: "This model, essentially, takes the middle ground
between the "primitive phagocyte" and "fateful encounter" scenarios of endosymbiosis: it is proposed that the
archaeal host had no full-fledged phagocytosis but did
possess a primitive mechanism for the engulfment of
other prokaryotic cells." Again, why would this feature
have been lost in archaea? Can the authors speculate on
this point?
Authors' response: We do not really claim that this feature was
lost in archaea. What we hypothesize is that the archaeal ancestor of eukaryotes that, in all likelihood, represented a deep
branch possessed this capacity. This branch could be extinct or
else could be still lurking in some obscure habitat, that is, of
course, a very interesting issue.
"With the input of the horizontally transferred bacterial
genes and, particularly, the endosymbiont genome, RhoGTPases and some of the actin-interacting proteins (such
as ARPC1 and coronin containing the WD40 domain or
profiling containing the Rossmann-type domain that
could be a highly diverged derivative of PAS or GAF) were
recruited as regulators of actin assembly."
How would actin assembly have been regulated before the
acquisition of the mitochondrion?
Authors' response: We do not know, of course. Possibly, not regulated. Experimental study of archaela acitn-like proteins might
provide clues.
Finally, I think that the data support equally either an
extinct archaeal lineage at the origin of modern eukaryo-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/9

tes or an extinct phagocytic eukaryotic lineage. Importantly, in both cases all pre-mitochondrial lineages -be
these archaeal or eukaryotic- would have gone extinct,
which is the main argument usually raised by the proponents of symbiotic scenarios against the archezoa one.
Could the authors explain why they prefer the first
hypothesis?
Authors' response: obviously, a big point, and the proposed solution necessarily remains speculative. In the context of the more
general debate, the symbiotic scenarios at least offer a plausible
path to the eukaryotic cell, and the analysis in this paper adds
another important bit in the form of the possibility of existence
of archaeal branched cytoskeleton.
Reviewer's report 2: Gaspar Jekely, Max Planck Institute
for Developmental Biology, Tübingen
This interesting paper by Yutin et al. addresses one of the
most important and hotly debated issues about the origin
of eukaryotes, namely the origin of phagocytosis.

It is now clear that the last common ancestor of eukaryotes was able to perform phagocytosis, and possessed
essentially all the characteristic eukaryotic organelles,
including mitochondria. The debate is about whether
phagotrophy or mitochondria came first. Since both
evolved in the stem lineage leading to modern eukaryotes,
the order of origins is problematic. Cell biological considerations rather favor a phagotrophic host for the mitochondrium, but there are also strong advocates for the
alternative.
One way to test the two models would by a thorough phylogenetic analysis of the proteins involved in phagocytosis. If most of these proteins turned out to be of alphaproteobacterial origin, this would favor the mitochondrium-first scenario. Conversely, if most proteins were
similar to ones found in archaebacteria, the sister lineage
to the eukaryotic host, the phagotrophy-first scenario
would gain support.
Yutin et al. try to resolve the issue exactly this way. In my
opinion, however, they fail to find a conclusive answer, or
more precisely, the data fail to yield a clear support for
either scenario. The solution they propose is somewhat
arbitrary, at least if we want to conclude something strictly
based on the data presented. I will explain why I think this
is the case.
The presence of the closest relatives of actin and actin-like
proteins in some archaebacteria (the most important finding of the paper!) is consistent with many scenarios. It is
clear that these proteins, even if they formed branched filaments, don't make the archaebacteria that possess them
phagotrophic, not even in the inefficient way as presented

Page 20 of 26
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2009, 4:9

in the authors' scenario. So their scenario is based on,
again, cell biological speculations, namely that the host
cell had to lose its cell wall and had to evolve a primitive
form of phagotrophy before the mitochondrial symbiosis.
Even though I would agree with such a conclusion, based
on cell biological speculation, I don't think it follows
from the data. I of course agree with the authors that the
alternative, the lack of close actin-homologs in archaebacteria, and their presence in alpha-proteobacteria would be
a very strong argument against the phagotrophy-first scenario, but they didn't find this. The history of actin therefore does not resolve the issue.
Regarding the small GTPases, it seems to support the
mitochondria-early scenario, but I am afraid that the correct interpretation of this tree is difficult, and depends on
when and in which direction the putative HGT events
took place. The proteins are present in both eu- and
archaebacteria, and could have come both ways. It is also
a formal possibility that the two major eukaryotic small
GTPase groups were transferred early on into different
prokaryotes. So, again, it is hard to make a strong conclusion.
However, all of the above does not mean that the authors'
scenario is uninteresting and not worth pursuing!
Authors' response: It seems that the differences between our
interpretation of the results and Jekely's view is, mostly, in
emphasis. We do not deny that that the comparative-genomic
and phylogenetic analyses do not unequivocally determine the
evolutionary scenarios, so "cell-biological" speculation has its
own important role. In the case of small GTPases, the evidence
of bacterial origin of the eukaryotic proteins involved in particular in the regulation of phagocytosis seems strong (Fig. 3).
I have another problem regarding the independent origin
of advanced phagocytosis in different eukaryotic groups. I
think it is unjustified. First of all, there are many near-universal factors (29 proteins conserved in 4 out of 5 species),
as identified by the comparative proteomic study. These
proteins include the core actin nucleation, branching and
polymerization machinery (Arp2/3, actin, myosin, Rabs
etc.). I think this can equally be interpreted the opposite
way, namely that the core machinery is remarkably conserved. The authors compare the phagosome proteome to
the spliceosome and the NPC, but I don't think these are
the best choice, since both are multiprotein complexes,
and not membrane compartments/processes. It would be
more informative to compare phagosome conservation
for example to the conservation of endosome or peroxisomes proteome. By the way, the low conservation of the
Entamoeba phagosome proteome among different strains
also is contrary to the authors' argument. According to the
same logic, these different Entamoeba strains evolved

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/9

advanced phagocytosis three times independently. Adding to this, the fact that there is no conserved phagocytosis
receptor only indicates that these organisms phagocytose
very different things, for which different receptors are
needed. All in all, the divergence of the proteomes is most
likely due to evolutionary divergence and the differences
in methodology. I think it is still a very safe conclusion
that the eukaryotic common ancestor was an advanced
phagotroph with actin-based protrusion, prey uptake and
acidification by V-ATPase. If all this basic cell biology is
not, then what would be considered as conserved?
Authors' response: As emphasized in the paper, the conserved
components of the phagocytic machinery comprise the generic
cytoskeleton, whereas the componentry specific to phagocytosis
is poorly conserved. The argument that the differences in the
composition of the phagosomes in different organisms reflects
the fact they "organisms phagocytose very different things"
seems dubious because they all phagocytose bacteria. The argument from the differences between Entamoeba strains is curious; we would tend to believe that these differences reflect the
malleable composition of the phagosomes not their different origins.
Minor comments
The authors state, that "plants cells are not phagocytic".
This is mostly true (one exception is the prasinophyte
green alga with surface scales cited in [104], however
plants originated when a biciliate host phagocytosed a
cyanobacterium. So the plant lineage is also ancestrally
phagocytic.

Authors' response: This is an interesting point but, strictly
speaking, we cannot be sure that engulfment of cyanobacterial
symbiont comprised bona fide phagocytosis. In Fig. 4, we put a
question mark on the Plantae supergroup vis-à-vis its phagocytic ability, and it seems like we have to leave it at that.
"To date no phagocytosis has been reported in fungi".
One exception is the basal fungus Rozella allomycis, which
can phagocytose organelles of its host [31].
Authors' response: This is an interesting exception that we now
mention in the revised Background section.
Rhizaria can also be phagotrophic (e.g. some Foraminifera).
Authors' response: We indicate in the Background section that
phagocytosis of bacteria occurs in various unicellular eukaryotes
which covers Rhizaria. However, it seems to make sense to keep
the question mark in Fig. 4because the data are fragmentary.

Reviewer's report 3: Pierre Pontarotti
The authors carried out a comparative analysis between
the phagosome of eukaryote from highly divergent phyla
by using data from proteomic analyses and literature
searches.

Authors found that several proteins have been conserved
inferring that the corresponding genes were present in the
common ancestor of the present days living eukaryotes
and were involved in the ancestral phagocytosis.
To extend their analyses, they subsequently checked for
the presence of these conserved eukaryote genes in
archaea and bacteria.
They found that the orthologues of one of such a gene are
present in subset of archaea. This gene is orthologous to
eukaryotic actins gene and share unusual structural features with actins related proteins (Arp) 2 and 3. The
authors deduced that the presence of common structural
features in Arp/23 and the archea actins, implies that the
common ancestors between the archaea and eukaryotic
actins were able to develop branch filaments.
They further found that the orthologue of the Rho family
appeared to be of bacterial origin.
These two findings lead the authors to hypothesize than
the ancestor of the eukaryotes was an archeon that had an
actin-based-cytoskeleton allowing engulfment of one bacteria (that will become the mitochondrion), horizontal
transfer then occurred leading to eukaryogenesis.
I think that this hypothesis on the origin of the eukaryotic
phyla is of great interest. However the authors' conclusion
is only based on two genes (one from archea origin and
the other from bacterial origin).
My first recommendation is to change the title as follows:
"the possible origins of phagocytosis and eukaryogenesis"
that should better describe the works of authors.
Authors' response: Point made and noticed but we stick to the
original title. Any analysis of the origins of a biological system
deals with the possible rather than certain; we believe there is
no need to state this explicitly.
Other comments:
Concerning the" lack of phylogenetic coherence", the
authors argue logically, that this could be due to imperfect
detection of phagosomal proteins with the applied proteomic methods or variability of the phagocytosis
machinery. One way to go further is to check the presence
of the apparently absent proteins at genome level.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/9

If the corresponding genes are found, then two explanations are possible
1) Gene co-option
2) The corresponding protein have been missed by the
proteomic analysis
The authors could then label the protein as "probably
involved in phagocytosis"
This approach will increase the number of conserved
eukaryotic phagocytosis proteins. This enlarged set could
be used to identify orthologues in bacteria and archea and
could help to strengthen the author's hypothesis as suggested above.
Authors' response: Effectively, we employ a very similar
approach by including in the analysis proteins that were
detected in subsets of the phagosomal proteomes. We chose not
to relax the standard further.
The authors wrote : "Crenarchaeota of the order of Thermoproteales and the only sequenced genome of Korarchaeum encode an actin homolog the eukaryotic actin"
Here the authors have to explain why some of the Crenarchaeta do not have actin genes?
If they hypothesize gene loss, did this loss happened several times, or did it happen once (the answer will be given
by the tree topology)?
The next question is why the Thermoproteales retain these
genes and not the other phyla of Crenarchaeta. Some discussion is required here.
Authors' response: A brief discussion was added. 'Why' questions are, of course, hardly answerable.
